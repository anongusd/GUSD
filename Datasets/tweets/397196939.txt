@TeamPelosi No you don't work for the people, you are trying your best to subvert the people to be your slaves. So you can get even richer before the collapse of the US from your policies.
@TheDemocrats @HouseDemocrats Because up till now you weren't socialist trying to create a paradise for yourselves off the taxpayer's back. You all know as well as most thinking people what is going to happen. You will destroy the US just like all socialist counties to date, but in the mean time you get rich
@SenFeinstein Based on lining your pockets at the expense of the taxpayer we can see what is going on. Typical Democrats
@TheDemocrats Really ? You are wasting tax payer's time and dollars with this BS, and we all see it!
@SenSchumer @senatemajldr Keep right on waiting! If you would ask an intelligent question maybe you would get an answer. Most of us that do any research know that subject is nothing but Democratic BS.

@MSNBC @MaddowBlog Maybe you should look a little beyond the end of your nose at the evidence and what the people that live in that area are seeing and dealing with on a daily bases, instead of spewing your leftist propaganda. https://t.co/iDiItLxgHl

@RepMcGovern @NWSBoston @senatemajldr @realDonaldTrump #DemocratShutdown	#ShumerPelosiShutdown
@RepMcGovern NO you and @HouseDemocrats created this, enough, fix it and stop playing the blame game, Stop this coup.
@RepMcGovern Liar, we can see what is going on, you think we are stupid, what does that say about you.
@RepMcGovern @HouseDemocrats It’s very simple, Mr. McGovern:		Step 1: End your shutdown.	Step 2: Negotiate a deal.		This is a #DemocratShutdown you all created this not stop this coup and start working with the President and the people of this United States. Instead of attacking and hurting us.
@HouseDemocrats Because you all have one goal in mind, Destroy the United states so you can create your socialistic one world order. #DemocratShutdown #ShumerPelosiShutdown and to get it started you are trying to overthrow our president with your coup. This pure Hatred you have is getting crazy.
@tedlieu @POTUS You are absolutely wrong here, you are nothing short of being the same Propagandist as the rest of the Democratic party, The @TheDemocrats have been playing this game for over 40 years. You know as the rest of us that once you get what you want then the talking is through.
@keithellison Even better than the Border Control Agents that work it day in, day out. Really!!!
@RepSpanberger @HouseDemocrats In a process that you knew as well as everyone else was nothing but a waste of time and tax payers dollars, you were and are just putting on a show. Stop the BS propaganda, and get busy and fix this issue instead of grandstanding and making a fool of yourself.
@TheDemocrats Yup you own this one no doubt in anyones eye's @TheDemocrats #shumershutdown #DemocratShutdown
@SenFeinstein That's cool! Are you going to own this one, when people lose their jobs and/or hours per week. Because if you know anything about economics you know that on top of everything else prices on everything involved are going up also. Makes a world of sense to the @TheDemocrats huh...
@TheDemocrats It’s time for you to start working with the Republicans this is BS and you know it
@MarkWarner She isn't or can't get unemployment insurance? And furthermore what are you doing about getting her back to work? Blaming the President &amp; the Republicans. Stop the BS and get to work getting this solved, the blame game is getting old especially since it belongs to @TheDemocrats
Even if you are correct, then why is it okay if they even kill one person and you don't do anything about it. What about your war on guns, what about your seatbelt laws, what about bicycle helmets on kids, motorcycles etc... You are a HYPOCRITE! https://t.co/BP8ysMH85B

@SenatorMenendez Get your facts straight it is the #DemocratShutdown You can try to blame who ever but we the citizens of this great United States a can see who this #shutdown belongs to. And so can the majority of the world. So stop playing with the girls on a beach and do your job. Stop the BS

@SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi @TeamPelosi @tedlieu @RepAdamSchiff  @TheDemocrats @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats End it now, stop hurting the workers. Stop endangering the US Citizens, Stop the drugs. https://t.co/wxTyRU5cLg
@CoryBooker How about you securing the border and getting these people back to work, you and @TheDemocrats are the one doing this. STOP IT NOW
@TheDemocrats Stop the games and fix it.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Your temper tantrum statement is worn out give it up. If anyone is throwing a temper tantrum it is you. And you are the one hurting the US Citizen workers and their families with you temper tantrum plus endangering all other citizens with the illegals, and drugs from Mexico.
@TheDemocrats You are a blatant liar! You are the ones that are putting the US Citizens in danger. Fix it now!
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Then stop with your BS and fix it. You are the one that caused this and we all know it. And you think we are stupid it appears. Well you are just showing us who is the problem here. Call it what you want, but we now you are the cause of it.
@tedlieu @FAANews Then stop with your BS and fix it    The US citizens are getting tired of your BS. You’re just lying and twisting everything just deliberately trying to agitate. Stir the water. What worthless cull you have shown yourself to be.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump That's right so stop using them as such!. What you are doing is ridicules, The US Citizens deserve better. Why don't you want to help the black people and the poor people. They want to work, but no you want to let people who aren't citizens take all the low income jobs. Enough!
@nanegge @RepDonBacon I think you are a racist, Why don't you want to help the black people get jobs, no you would rather let all the illegals in so there isn't jobs for the Blacks or poor people.
@SpeakerPelosi Then fix it! Your the one that is refusing to do anything. I'm beginning to wonder if @TheDemocrats are maybe still the racist people they have been in our past. Why do you refuse to fix the border issues when you know it affects the jobs for the Black population and poor.

@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump You are a liar! You and @thedemocates are the ones hurting them all for you vendetta against the president. Start acting like an adult
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump @GOPLeader You are the insult to them, Stop the BS and start fixing the US instead of showing your second childhood dreams of controlling others.
@RepJoeKennedy @NydiaVelazquez Absolutely wrong, That is a bald faced lie, You and your kind have been creating this issue for many, many years now. Now stop the BS and fix it.  The United States Citizen deserve better, Stop acting like little kids with a vendetta.
@SenSchumer Then give the US citizen border security and you can do just that. You and @SpeakerPelosi are the reason for this. Stop with your vendetta against @POTUS its getting to where it is looking like insanity from your party. You are adults start acting like it.
@RepBonnie Hey their bragging about all of these billions they already have why don’t they use some of it instead of making the taxpayers pay for it.  No they would rather give it to illegals.  Which will infiltrate from there to the rest of the US making us pay again.
@SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer want to destroy President Trump even at the cost of the safety of the US Citizen. The reason to get the government running is then they know there will be no more negotiation on the wall. It will come to a screeching halt as it has for the last 30 years https://t.co/UpT3NHiDws
@stacker2005 @GOP @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi And so do I and you cannot disprove the fact that I laid out there that came from the GOP you could twist all you want but the facts are the facts
@stacker2005 @GOP @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi You have every right to believe what you want the same as I do. But when you call someone something maybe you are to look at yourself.  If the shoe fits wear it.  Or better yet old Indian saying “ first Fox smelled his own ass hole “
@stacker2005 @GOP @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi In 2018. Over 17,000 adults arrested at the border had prior criminal records. This included over 6000 gang members I made your number of those members were from MS 13
@stacker2005 @GOP @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi End of fiscal year 2018, US border patrol seized or help cheese 282,000 pounds of cocaine, 248,000 pounds Of methamphetamine, 6,500 pounds of heroin, and 2,400 pounds of fentanyl.
@stacker2005 @GOP @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi In for CBP sectors where physical barriers have been expanded – El Paso, Yuma, Tucson, and San Diego –  illegal traffic has you dropped by at least 90%
@tightline88 @GOP You know as well as I do that after the government is opened as you want, that will be the end of any negotiation. You don't believe me look at the history of securing the border over the last 30 + years. This has been going on that long and nothing ever gets done.
@stacker2005 @GOP Nobody believes the facts from the DNC either they are just as incapable of telling the truth, just like @SenSchumer and @SpeakerPelosi
@RepAdamSchiff Did you ask them or are you just assuming like always more political BS
@Freeirony @CBSNews @CBSThisMorning @TheDemocrats @POTUS It appears that is all you get from the article, I can see a lot more info besides just that!
@Freeirony @CBSNews @CBSThisMorning @TheDemocrats @POTUS @SenSchumer @RepAdamSchiff @tedlieu @SpeakerPelosi Doesn't matter what I say you will state its not so just the same as I do with your claiming Trump is fear mongering - There are over 325,233 people in 22 days that are willing to put their own money where their mouth is for the wall.  over $19,560,938.
@Freeirony @CBSNews @CBSThisMorning @TheDemocrats @POTUS Look at what Wikipedia has to say about it - https://t.co/NZIeAklbYf
@Freeirony @CBSNews @CBSThisMorning @TheDemocrats @POTUS https://t.co/xWatpJ4k7C
@Freeirony @CBSNews @CBSThisMorning @TheDemocrats @POTUS Your concrete information is not the same as my concrete information, and from my view I see the liberals and most democrates as the ones fear mongering like @SenSchumer @RepAdamSchiff @tedlieu @SpeakerPelosi and many more. So I would say that's what makes the world go around huh
@Freeirony @CBSNews @CBSThisMorning @TheDemocrats @POTUS That's like 97% of the people are against the border wall huh! from one of your congressmen. CBS stated 80% are for it. Who do we believe,
@Freeirony @CBSNews @CBSThisMorning @TheDemocrats @POTUS The clear bias is your interpretation of what you think and the articles you read choosing what you want to believe.
@Freeirony @CBSNews @CBSThisMorning @TheDemocrats @POTUS You said all the ranchers were against the wall, again lot of fact omitted here an not all are against it. A lot of the ranchers will lose hunting leases because of the border wall among other issues. watch this rancher and his views https://t.co/b5pGZlCmzi
@Freeirony @CBSNews @CBSThisMorning @TheDemocrats @POTUS No both sides are just a guilty of twisting the numbers and facts. If you have ever ran a business and did the facts and numbers you can make them say almost anything. You hear it all the time business is doing great next day its in bankruptcy. Numbers prove nothing. facts do
@Freeirony @CBSNews @CBSThisMorning @TheDemocrats @POTUS I guess it boils down to which you choose to believe because both sides make their statements and the other comes along and tries to disprove it. doesn't matter what the subject is. And I know both sides stretch it bad.  you might check this one. https://t.co/DoTNWu3Tri
https://t.co/yYGU4NJ0hJ
@tedlieu @SecNielsen You lie just as much as anyone else up there that you think is lying. So you are just as bad of a liar. And a liar in my book is a worthless cull.
@Freeirony @CBSNews @CBSThisMorning @TheDemocrats @POTUS Did you check out the article from https://t.co/lulx1PtZ8x. You might check this article I found it interesting also. https://t.co/zWUHHtRQAX
@Freeirony @CBSNews @CBSThisMorning @TheDemocrats @POTUS Coming from who, because for every article stating it is bad there is just as many stating the opposite. I always try to look at the source rather that what is stated, Everyone is lying to make their point, or at least stretching the truth and twisting it.
@Freeirony @CBSNews @CBSThisMorning @TheDemocrats @POTUS It does mention it but uses very little data from it, even still I don't see where the FAIR report is like you say been debunked.
@Freeirony @CBSNews @CBSThisMorning @TheDemocrats @POTUS Sorry I don't follow the FAIR report anymore than others You debunking it is a far stretch. https://t.co/bLipl2fC3M

@RashidaTlaib You @RashidaTlaib created the controversy not anyone else. And you need to focus on protecting the US Citizen, instead of trying to destroy it. Are you really for protecting the US Citizen, or are you with those that are out to destroy it.
@donald_fox @ChrisMurphyCT @EdKrassen They didn't do one on Obama obviously, so what the _____ are you talking about.
@ChrisMurphyCT You are full of BS, I don't even think 97% of the left agree with that statement, try again!
@Freeirony @CBSNews @CBSThisMorning @TheDemocrats @POTUS OK  I will research that from your point of view  a little later I have to work now it was fun enjoyed the Conversation. Maybe I can get back later
@Freeirony @FlyingpitaJill @CBSNews @CBSThisMorning @TheDemocrats @POTUS That’s it in a nutshell. But like you said it’s not all eminent domain there are people on the border who want to keep it open that is part of the reason it is so hard to shut it down. I personally think they should be held liable for the cost of allowing illegals in
@Freeirony @CBSNews @CBSThisMorning @TheDemocrats @POTUS I’m sorry but you are absolutely wrong at them being a net positive for our economy you need to do a little more research the facts are there that prove otherwise.
@Freeirony @FlyingpitaJill @CBSNews @CBSThisMorning @TheDemocrats @POTUS All the wall he wants to put up is on eminent domain that what you’re saying!
@Freeirony @CBSNews @CBSThisMorning @TheDemocrats @POTUS You are correct it cannot run on a deficit. But how much of this illegal border crossing is it costing the US taxpayers know a lot more than a wall would cost to slow it down
@Freeirony @FlyingpitaJill @CBSNews @CBSThisMorning @TheDemocrats @POTUS If you were going to build a wall clear across the United States which is been debunked several times then you would be taking land from American people to get it done. That is not the cases not all the land has to be taken away from someone where they want to build a wall.
@Freeirony @CBSNews @CBSThisMorning @TheDemocrats @POTUS How is it not the same in a smaller manner. Do you allow just anyone to walk through your door or window and take whatever food or whatever else is in there that they need more than you need it
@Freeirony @FlyingpitaJill @CBSNews @CBSThisMorning @TheDemocrats @POTUS They are not stealing land from anyone where did you hear that kind of BS. Putting walls up channels the border crossings two areas that can be monitored electronically
@Freeirony @FlyingpitaJill @CBSNews @CBSThisMorning @TheDemocrats @POTUS And when you stop them from one position they move to another so putting barriers up to stop them in certain areas makes it less cumbersome on everyone trying to monitor the open areas
@Freeirony @CBSNews @CBSThisMorning @TheDemocrats @POTUS Nobody said that the purpose is to slow it down so that it can be better managed
@Freeirony @CBSNews @CBSThisMorning @TheDemocrats @POTUS How is it dumb you don’t live behind walls with locks on your doors
@Freeirony @FlyingpitaJill @CBSNews @CBSThisMorning @TheDemocrats @POTUS So what would be better in your eyes? Maybe drones. So you can just watch them come across the border. How many thousands more guards are going to have to be there to catch them that way. That won’t work and you know it
@ChrisMurphyCT You are so full of BS that it is incredible. You guys can dream up some pretty pathetic twists to try and make a point. This is absurd. Really, Aren't you smarter than this kind of garbage.
@FlyingpitaJill @Freeirony @CBSNews @CBSThisMorning @TheDemocrats @POTUS We might not stop the drugs in human trafficking and illegals from coming into the United States but it least we were slow it down with the wall and I think any fool can see that
@Freeirony @CBSNews @CBSThisMorning @TheDemocrats @POTUS If a wall doesn’t work why do you live behind them with locked doors?
Anybody want to call the odds as to how many Dem vs. how many Rep are involved in it. I betting Dem win hands down with the most. https://t.co/gIrdj7pHM6
@CBSNews @CBSThisMorning The way the @TheDemocrats are acting it almost looks like that is what he is going to have to do. I find it hard to understand why they are so animate at not trying to fix this. They know as well as everyone does that walls help. They are just being spiteful against the @POTUS
@SenSchumer @navy_reserve This is awesome that he is willing to protect us! When are you @SenSchumer going to do the same instead of trying to destroy us with your politics. We need border protection and watching them with a drone won't do it unless you are mounting AR15's to them, that might help.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Dear @tedlieu You not only refuse to protect the legal US Citizen, you want to make them suffer as much as you can, until they accept the fact that you won't help them. Sounds dictatorial to me. Refuse to protect, refuse to help.

@lynns2hands @TwitterMoments @POTUS You obviously like all the lefties think you know what everyone else thinks. You Don't! Where did I say I agreed with the statement made over ten years ago by our president! I think you need to slow down and think before accusing.  and understand doing the same doesn't justify it
@komura62 @TwitterMoments But in your eyes its better than calling someone a Mother___ker huh, well maybe the other person sees it the other way or even just as bad. So how did you fix anything with that BS.
@pamelaaustin5 That your favorite word, how are you any better than the person you are putting down? Let me clue you in it doesn't and says you are just as bad.
@pamelaaustin5 @TwitterMoments And so that justifies your doing the same, you are doing nothing but helping to trash the world what does that make you! That makes you nothing more than a trouble making agitator trying to start something you may wish you didn't start.

@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Keep jumping up and down and enjoying yourself, it's obvious you are with @SenSchumer &amp; @SpeakerPelosi in the destruction of the United States. What are you working for Civil War, and/or population thinning?
@thehill How can @SpeakerPelosi possibly read the constitution to say that! So with that mentality she is above @VP  she can tell him what to do. Sounds to me like she has lost it. And this is what the United States has for 3rd inline to the presidency if it should come to that.
@RashidaTlaib Liar!!!
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump No @SenSchumer you are doing everything in your power to destroy the US and I personally think you know it and are doing it on purpose. Why are you deliberately trying to push the US into a civil war? Is it because you want a socialist government, or maybe to thin the population.

@TheDemocrats Los @demócrates solo te están usando. Tan pronto como obtengan lo que quieren, serás como todo lo demás desechado a medida que se apresuran hacia su próximo movimiento socialista. Podrían preocuparse menos por ti o por cualquier otra persona, solo por su poder.
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Oh WOW, coming from a woman who says its just crumbs to over a 1000 dollars. You speak with fork tongue!
@BarbaraBoxer Please explain why we have enough to give Mexico and Central America over 10 billion for their border security, but not 5 billion to fix our border security.
@TheDemocrats You should be ashamed for denying border security and these people checks. This is nothing but your game, every year you either change tracks or refuse to sign anything in that would help. Everything says you want open borders, meaning that this country would no longer exist.
@KamalaHarris Well you do what ever you think you have to. But we are tired of your talk, talk, talk that we have been getting from you for the last 30 or 40 years. First you want it one way, then its the other way, the next time it comes up, anything to create gridlock and get nothing done.
@SenatorMenendez @SenateDems I agree, so do something about it rather than talk, talk, talk as you have for the last 30 or 40 years.
@RepSwalwell Really @RepSwalwell I think the shoe fits you even better.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Put the blame anywhere you want, but we all know who is causing this shutdown @SenSchumer and why? because you hate the @POTUS, I mean you were for it in 2013 now you are against it. This is nothing short of your willingness to destroy the U.S. because of your hatred.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Yes @tedlieu he did say that, and I'm proud of him for doing it. But we all know who caused it @TheDemocrats so wear it and be proud of your failures in governing for the people and protecting us. You all wanted it in 2013, what changed? Your hatred for the @POTUS
@SenSchumer @SenWhitehouse Sorry buddy, but its you that is trying to push us into chaos. Get over your hatred for the President.
@washingtonpost Dream on, keep pushing your Propaganda, we all know better!
@RepDonaldPayne @realDonaldTrump You sir are pathetic. The Government is supposed to protect their citizens. But it seem the citizens are having to protect ourselves and you, because you refuse to do your job. We are getting tired of your rhetoric. https://t.co/sF14zWHWeg
@SenSchumer @NancyPelosi @SenFeinstein  You don't have a problem finding 10.6 Billion to help Mexico and Central America with their security, but can't find 5 Billion for our security. And You Are For Border Security! What a crock of BS! https://t.co/DwIWQrC5oB
@NancyPelosi You and your party has done nothing for border security but talk, talk, talk. on top of the fact that you were for a wall just a couple years ago. Stop with the act because that is all it is.

@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Put the blame where ever it suits you, but we all know who is to blame, He already told you he wasn't signing your one sided bill, so either fix it or wear it
@bravetinsoldier @RepBonnie Who cares where she from. And "FIRST FOX SMELLED HIS OWN A$$HOLE. Wise guy.
@RepBonnie You need to stop with the petty BS and get to work to solve this problem instead of nit picking and doing nothing but running your mouth.
@SenSchumer Better get your behind back up there and start working for the people for a change. You think your bullheaded shoving BS down our throats is funny, Well you are not getting it your way so easy. Start trying to do what the people want instead of what you want. You are not God!
@realDonaldTrump THANK YOU, Thank you, Thank you, for sticking to Border Security. We can not keep kicking it down the road been doing that for 40 years it seems anyway.

@KamalaHarris When are you going to look into this slush fund up there in Washington DC for the sexual buyoffs We want to know the names of everyone that has used that fund. What about @CoryBooker and @keithellison you need to start taking care of business you have a lot of dirt in your house.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @FBI What about @keithellison and @CoryBooker ? When are you going to treat them the same way, Or is it because they are @TheDemocrats so they are allowed to act that way. I think you need to start tending to correcting your own house. This is insanity and everyone can see it.
@BarbaraBoxer What are you doing or saying about @keithellison - https://t.co/M11NTcFvEo when are you going to treat this the same way?
@CoryBooker Trying to get in the good graces with the women huh. for your past!  Well we will see if its okay for you to have acted like that in the past but not a republican. Dirty Politics @TheDemocrats
@CoryBooker Brown nosing, because of the way you have treated women.

@SenJeffMerkley You an @SenFeinstein are two peas on a pod, propagating this BS Propaganda. Anyone and everyone knows better.
@SenFeinstein Tell me something it seem a lot of us are having a hard time figuring out when the Republicans ever denied her the chance to have her say. I think you are trying to convince your base with BS propaganda. Anyone that has followed this in the least knows better.
@pollsofpolitics @realDonaldTrump I don't know if he is guilty or not, either way the issue took place when they were both under the age of 18. So if this is allowed then I believe every charge done on anyone under the age of 18 be opened up to hang on their heads for the rest of their lives also.
@ChuckGrassley Well, I hate to say this but you have given this one away to Schumer, He played you like a fiddle. There is no way Kavanaugh will ever get voted in now. If the Dem. gain the house or senate then you have sold the U.S. down the tubes we will become a socialist country.

@JimOfficious @thehill An interesting article and I can remember a lot of what they telling us. The bottom line is Greed, There is no reason for the cost or threatment's or drugs other than to line someones pockets. But the government has a track record, they can't stop it and it gets bigger and bigger
@JimOfficious @thehill Their tax rate now is 50% and they can't cover it. So what would a fair tax rate be. Sooner or later that won't be enough either and so the taxes go up more, until there is no one left to tax, Socialism only works until you run out of other peoples money.
@JimOfficious @thehill Any time you start giving something away people start abusing it, going in for every little sniffle or sliver and the system becomes overloaded and then they run out of money. Sweden is finding that out now they are overburdened and collapsing as we talk about it. 1/2
@JimOfficious @thehill Haven't researched it yet, but have talked to a lot of people from Canada and they are not happy with it. I still have to work for a living I can't spent 24 7 on here researching and proving it isn't like you think it is.
@JimOfficious @thehill Your the one saying they had free health care I am showing you how free it is, that was the first one on the list.
@JimOfficious @thehill Developmental aid. Since fiscal year 1991, the U.S. has provided Albania with more than $616 million in assistance, not counting Foreign Agricultural Service food aid. In 2007, the U.S. gave over $21.1 million to Albania under the Support for East European Democracy Act program
@JimOfficious @thehill Have you looked into any country on the list, lets take the first one Albania, well if you decide to go there you better have almost everything you might need with you including a syringe if you need to take shots for anything. And I haven't looked into the financial issues yet.
@JimOfficious @thehill Where is it working?
@JimOfficious @thehill I see we will just have to agree to disagree here, I don't think it is happening as you would like for it. And if it did I believe that will be the end of the United States as either of us have known it. Very troubling times will be upon us.
@JimOfficious @thehill Socialized medicine will never work, they can't afford it, it alone will break the system. Have you been watching Sweden (the roll model for the world everyone says), well they are on the downhill run, they already are having huge issues to pay for it.
@ericbolling This seems to be the mentality of everyone on the left here on twitter or Facebook, I have to hope its not all of them, there has to be some that are sane, that can realize not everyone sees everything the same as they do. And they have the right not to.
@tedlieu @SecNielsen @tedlieu needs to resign.
@JimOfficious @thehill Healthcare and Education you referred to are both prime examples. They neither one are working. They are both money pits that will never find a bottom.
@JimOfficious @thehill So you like socialism, you must be younger, when I was young and in college I entertained the idea also. But as I got older I looked around and could see it doesn't work.
@JimOfficious @thehill You really think they are ignoring his "insanity" so they can put a conservative judge in, that doesn't make sense. 2+2 isn't making 4 there.
@JimOfficious @thehill Then the fact is that Congress is not believing what has been presented to them as do a lot of their constituent's. So to go beyond them is a destruction of the presidency and the United States as a democracy. What will the new government be, Socialism with a dictator?

@2Concussions @WispinskiD @JohnOtto77 @SenJeffMerkley @CoryBooker Well you don't seem to understand they new nothing about the deal that was made with Spartacus the night before his grandstanding BS session, maybe you should do a little research and understand what was happening. Maybe watch CSPAN once in a while, damn you might learn something
@Circusponi @RepStevenSmith @instapundit Still at it aren't you, it never gets any better with you guys!
@CoryBooker You are the one that Created a sham fake
@SenFeinstein It's established law, is what he said.  What part do you not understand? It doesn't matter what he thinks about it. I don't believe it was constitutional, but it is the law and has been tested several times. SO IT IS THE LAW. It should have been a states right not a federal right
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Then don't encourage them to do things that are illegal, in my book that makes you as guilty as they are.
@2Concussions @WispinskiD @JohnOtto77 @SenJeffMerkley @CoryBooker Think you are off subject there ADA Babe, might help if you could at least stay on the subject. Nobody was saying anything about FOX New here. It was about the fake Spartacus making claims and challenges that he knew was BS.

@Pattyshenker @RepLowenthal @HouseGOP Do you even know what an assault weapon is? It's pretty obvious from the picture you posted you don't even know what one is supposed to look like. So I can assume you have no idea what one is. - Sheepeople follow the leader. -

@SenFeinstein Absolutely, you have to get your socialist order up and running, you have to keep them above the law. You need to get real, the people of the United States don't want your socialist order.
@SenFeinstein What sensitive information? The names of all you @TheDemocrats that are trying to destroy the United States with your corruption!
@SenFeinstein Everyone including you needs to be answerable to someone. Otherwise they are the master, that's why you are trying to defend them, because you are losing control of your socialist order that you have been trying to impose on the United States.
@karis_lange @SenFeinstein We are! We are! Making America Great Again, even with all your crying and acting like 2 year olds and fighting every move, we are still gaining respect in the world and helping the great US citizens, you need to get your head out of the sand &amp; listening to the leftist propaganda.
@mikeandikeeater @SenFeinstein It's the @TheDemocrats that have put us where we are with your corruption. You have had control for decades, and damn near destroyed the United States with it.

@Biglyness @RepLowenthal Where do you get your data 900 injured in Vegas, my research says you are stretching that by about 400. You still had about 300 killed in NYC 2017
@Biglyness @RepLowenthal Okay, so you don't understand that 660 from 900 leaves what 240. How many were killed from Oct to Dec, bet that comes up to more than the 900 you are talking about that died, just in Chicago alone. Gun Laws don't work!!!

Why no comment on this CNN MSNBC and etc. Why isn't this all over the media. Because there was no firearm used it doesn't fit the narrative Gun Control. These people were brutally murdered, but no one care's because "NO GUN" https://t.co/9mf0qzr5qo

@Hope374 @FoxNews @DLoesch @POTUS @NRA I had one as a teenager, didn't shoot anyone either. That was in the 60's. And yes I used it to hunt. It was a 22, do you know what a 5.56 AR-15 is? It is a 223. It is very little larger (.003 larger) but has more powder behind it so it will reach a little farther with accuracy.

@PolticsNewz Just like Obama created the recession after Bush huh. You all need to rethink your statement, and look at the facts.
@DWStweets The same as you and all the #Democrats made it clear that you hate the US and all it stands for. You want to destroy it as it is making us a third world country for you @TheDemocrats to rule, it will be a cold day in ****...
@AntifaBranson Might do a little more research your assertion is a bit of a stretch  - https://t.co/0nwkivhMXe
@WhipHoyer @SquawkCNBC That makes about about as much sense as Obama taking the credit for the recession when he took office doesn't it. Come on get a life, Any thinking person can see beyond that BS.
@AudetteFulson @CBSNews I'm sorry for you, but it seems you are the horror show with you're foul mouth and attitude.
@SenWhitehouse @POTUS Well when you can't support him in any way for anything why should he even acknowledge your presents. You are a big boy pull your pants up and go rethink you're position in life and what the US Citizens want.

@RepPoliquin Thank you! What you are doing is very admirable.
@lifemaximize @janschakowsky How do you end something that was never started? Where's the bill for DACA? Why did the DNC reject CHIP now?  Who put DACA on the CR to try and bully and force their political agenda. Who cause the shutdown #DemocratShutdown #SchumerShutdown and we need #ReleaseTheMemo

Well it appears the Democrats' are still in control because to them the illegals are more important than the US Citizens. It is disgusting that they choose foreigners as being more important than the citizens they swore an oath to protect. They are Traitor's to the US citizens.
@KrisHereAgain @SenTinaSmith I didn't say that. Stop with the adlibbing No one is saying they don't have the majority, but when it takes 60 votes and your majority is 51 how much control do you have. Are you really that slow to not understand who really has control.

@WhipHoyer NO! you need to work with Republicans, Stop the BS
@SenCortezMasto @realDonaldTrump You want this to be like Obama Care "lets vote it in then we will find out what is in the bill" @NancyPelosi  That is exactly what you are doing here again. You really think everyone is that stupid don't you. Wake up we all aren't quite as stupid as you would like.
@SenCortezMasto @realDonaldTrump NO! You are the one's that want to shut the government down by trying to shove something you don't even have a bill for down everyone's throat. They are Illegal and you need to get your act together and bring something up and get it worked out to everyone mutual satisfaction.
Thank You @RepRickCrawford you are spot on here. #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/DFWpLPGv7b
@tedlieu @RepTedLieu you need to do some work instead of trying to BS the citizens of the US. We can see through you like a book. If you want or believe in something like DACA you need to at least make a bill showing what you want, you have nothing but BS here nothing more.

Absolutely correct! This BS statement that the Republican's control is just that. Anyone that knows anything about the process knows that also 51 of a needed 60 is not in control. https://t.co/dNjJ9r17mH
@debbiesideris This is bogus and you know it, it's nothing but a power play from the Democrats because the don't like Trump. There is no reason to even add DACA to this bill, there still has never even been a bill drawn up from them, and it doesn't come due until the middle of March.
@SenSchumer Shutting the government down is on your back over a bogus political game you are pulling. This is not necessary and you know it. https://t.co/4rGcsLgjx9
