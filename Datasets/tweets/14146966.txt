@marina282828 I listened to it twice. This is exactly what she was quoted as saying.
I just listened to the entire clip two times. And Rep. Omar says EXACTLY what she was quoted as saying critical of Obama. Have a listen for yourself. https://t.co/e4w9ojhEzR
@smallicedlatte Why? Why the need to knock Obama at all right now? Why aren’t you people focused like a laser beam on Donald Trump, rather than giving Donald Trump fodder to continue his policies by saying “Obama didn’t too”? Trump will use that argument to continue his policy.
@edisn Oh, and we probably would’ve never had the votes for more anyway.
@edisn And there’s the rub. I wish Obama had tried to do more on the ACA for example. And again, what he did you almost blew up in our faces multiple times. Had he done more, we could’ve lost the whole thing with backlash. You never know how far is too far.
@draagonslayer19 Overall Obama was a great president who saved the world economy and the American economy from absolute collapse, gave health care to millions and rescued the entire country from the pre-existing conditions BS, freed the gays, got us out of Iraq. For starters.
@holybullies Exactly. Even were she right, and I don’t think she is, how does it possibly benefit Democrats generally, or this policy in particular, to let Trump off the hook like that? She gave him the talking point he needs to keep hurting kids. It’s arrogant, reckless, and naive.
@holybullies And here’s what else. Even if you THINK that Obama is as bad as Trump, you don’t SAY IT as a Democratic member of Congress, handing Trump the talking point he needs to continue his horrific policy of separating kids from their parents and then losing the parents. Who does that?

@holybullies She didn’t get her two pet issues resolved. Fair enough. But don’t lecture me about how Trump is just like Obama, especially when she misstates what Obama’s policy was on child separation.
@swin24 One huge problem with that story &amp; this narrative.

@Grracy There’s a huge difference between Omar’s claim that Obama put children in cages just like Trump, and Obama kept children with their mothers in detention. I’m sorry, but that’s not even close. The entire issue is ripping children from their families and then losing the parents.
@Nathan_Okay Yeah he killed a bunch of terrorists. I have no problem with that nor do most of American people, nor do most Democrats. Let’s not overgeneralize in order to score points.
This is part of the larger effort on the left-of-the-left to rewrite Obama’s legacy and paint him as a ‘bad’ president. I get why they had to destroy Hillary with lies, as they wanted her to lose, but it’s still unclear to me why the far left is so hell-bent on destroying Obama. https://t.co/gPjMSNrlHz
Rep. Omar says Obama was a more polished version of Trump, and suggests — incorrectly — that Obama jailed kids just like Trump did.		That is a lie, in addition to being a key Trump talking point that we now have a Democratic congresswoman repeating. https://t.co/7I6uktj6wv https://t.co/8ibV632Lah
Every time Donald Trump says “there was no collusion,” keep in mind that this is Donald Trump. Not only is he a congenital liar, but he tends to focus on things that he’s actually guilty of. Trump’s panic about collusion means there was collusion, and worse.
The Bill Shine story really is amazing in that Trump reportedly got rid of Shine because Shine was unable to improve the tone of the press coverage of Trump. Trump actually believes he’s getting bad stories because his STAFF isn’t good enough, not because he’s just bad.

Wait, Manafort never expressed regret during his closing statement before the judge, he never said he’s sorry for what he did.		And the judge still showed him massive leniency. That’s not right.
I also still want to know how much remorse Manafort showed in court today.
@writeorama Morally I’m with you. Legally, the lawyer in me, isn’t sure.
Manafort gets 47 months. That’s a little less than 4 years. That sounds like not that much. I was thinking more like 10 years. Enough to sting, but not be a life sentence. 4 years sounds low.
It’s a really intersting question whether a judge should consider that you have really shitty clients (dictators, or say, mobsters) when deciding your sentence on an unrelated crime.		I can imagine laymen saying YES! But the lawyers out there, what say you? https://t.co/8JrZJHXmTS
@ClaireSplan Under the law, in America, yes. You are not guilty of a crime you haven’t been convicted of. I think he had shitty clients. That’s not really a reason to increase his prison term for tax evasion, so long as his client work was legal.
@writeorama Not in the eyes of the law. That’s a legal, and seriously shitty, job in America. We don’t give people extra jail time because they’re legal lobbyists for bad people. That’s not American.
@kaburke9 Yes. though, those facts weren’t in evidence, so I don’t know that the judge can really say “you have shitty clients.” And, you’re allowed to have shitty clients in America, does that really go to your sentencing, if it’s not criminal behavior? (The lawyer in me talking now.)
@FL_lewoo No, it’s a different take that might not be your take. :)
@natchezalley6 What is anything?		:)		Paul Manafort is about to be sentenced. The judge is speaking now.
Though I assume what the judge means, is he has a legally spotless record, no crimes, other than this. That we know of. https://t.co/fhq7rLS1L0
Having said that, I’m not sure you should get what amounts to life in prison for non-violent crimes. Ten years, at his age, maybe. https://t.co/fhq7rLS1L0
I love that the judge says Paul Manafort led a good life helping other.		He worked for dictators.
I can’t wait to see if Trump celebrates tax day by giving a pardon to somebody who cheated on his taxes.		Also, a pardon won’t cover cheating on state taxes. It all depends on the state double jeopardy law.
That’s not a very compelling argument for compassion. The argument is remorse, not “my crime really set me back.” I’ll be curious to see if Manafort expressed any remorse at all. https://t.co/hWpSYNW1pW

RT @Lazulioness: @aravosis Q: Why does Kim call Trump “Mandy”?	A: Because he came and he gave without taking! 	https://t.co/uUiL031e3U
But spare us the revisionist stories about how Kim begged for a deal, but Trump the great negotiator refused because it just wasn’t good enough for his beloved America. Trump wasn’t in Vietnam representing America, he was representing Trump Inc. Work backwards from there. 5/
What really happened to blow up the Korea summit? Probably what blows everything up for Trump, ego and personal pique. Trump &amp; Kim are long-lost brothers enthralled by their own cult of personality and bad haircut. Either Trump insulted Kim, or Kim insulted Trump.		4/
And note that it took Trump a week to come up w/ this excuse for why the summit blew up. If it were true that Kim didn’t offer enough, &amp; Trump “the great negotiator” held firm to his ideals, the White House would’ve been trumpeting that a week ago, not suddenly leaking it now.3/
A) Trump was desperate for ANY deal, as part of his effort to get a Nobel. He unilaterally caved to Kim &amp; Putin by halting US military exercises in the region during the last summit. But now we’re supposed to believe Trump is a tough negotiator? Please. 		2/
I call BS. This new “report” that Kim begged Trump for a last minute deal, “but it just wasn’t enough for Trump, so he walked.”		B.S. Pure Trump spin, that’s taken him a week to come up with, mind you. 		1/

@mwr_dbm Hey, they just got him kicked off of Twitter, so there’s that.
This story is incredible. Jacob Wohl is a darling of the GOP, and the Trumps. In the USA Today story he openly brags about just outright lying: “In describing his methods, Wohl casually explained that he makes it up: ‘I’ll literally hear one thing and I’ll flip it 180 degrees.’”
Jacob Wohl just gave an interview to USA Today in which he confesses to intentionally tweeting disinfo about Kamala Harris, and details his plans to use Facebook &amp; Twitter in 2020 to create fake “left-wing” accts. Twitter just banned him. Will FB? https://t.co/AeYGMyK9tP

@AnitaNelson No, i’ve never been in favor of just paying out cash to people. Spend the cash on education and health care, absolutely.
As I noted earlier, “reparations” seems to be embraced by a number of democratic candidates as simply meaning more social programs. That’s not controversial on the left. Cash payments are. As Bernie noted, everyone seems to be using a different definition. https://t.co/2d0YtS16Z8
And I think reparations is an issue that risks splitting the Democratic Party in two. And forget about winning the middle. We’re all acting like it’s some kind of mainstream position that everyone on the left automatically accepts. I don’t think that’s true at all. https://t.co/mZEYywpKoU
@BullMooseFuture I think you’re right.
@DiscoPotential Yup. Sadly a lot of folks aren’t very good at their messaging.
@MJWilliams1975 Oh they don’t even use that phrase here in the US. Here they call themselves “ democratic socialists,” which is even worse. In Europe they’re social democrats. But you raise a larger point: focus on policies, don’t distract by calling yourself a socialist.
@DiscoPotential She gave a weird answer that Wolf quoted, sounded more programmatic.
“An idiot sheep.”		Russians are so cute in English. https://t.co/I6vFOfgMG3
I’m w/ Bernie on “reparations.” It depends what the word means. If it’s “doing more to address the problem of systemic racism,” absolutely. If it’s cash payments... I think Warren is hedging by calling a programmatic approach “reparations.” Bernie is right, what’s the definition?
Good answer on Rx drugs from Bernie.
@GMSarli AND guess what? In Europe social democratic health care &amp; education policies operate w/in capitalist countries. Maybe they’re “cuddly capitalists,” as some have called them. But still. My point is that American social democrats shouldn’t accept the premise, unless they agree :-)
On the big issues, Bernie gives good answers: e.g., health care, education. But it’s interesting to see someone as experienced as him still trip up on certain questions: releasing tax returns; sexual harassment in campaign; and why not call Maduro a dictator. He hedges.
I don’t think Bernie should buy into the suggestion that he’s going to get rid of capitalism. That will scare voters. He should call that out every time he’s asked about it. You can adopt ideas that are “social Democratic” without “eliminating capitalism.”
Still a weak answer on sexual harassment. 1st answer was to chastise the questionnaire, then ignore the question. 		Weak answer on taxes too. Great to promise to release them some day, but when? And bad answer on why he’s refused to date. He needs better answers. 		#BernieOnCNN

The socialist wing of the left isn’t about “us” winning as the left or the country, they are exclusively about hurting Democrats and helping themselves. https://t.co/IpdXiIexc9

Perhaps my favorite menial task was when I got roped into making Moussaka (I’m Greek) for a multi-Senator dinner at the Senator’s house — his wife asked me to — I walk in with the Moussaka, his wife looks at it &amp; says “I don’t think that works with the dinner,” and didn’t use it. https://t.co/8txRQlFsGH
I’m agnostic on the merits of the “Klobuchar is mean” discussion. But it is worth  noting that we’ve spent weeks talking about her, and — what? — a day talking about “Bernie enabled sexual harassment” during the 2016 campaign.		The woman’s scandal is sexier, even when it’s not.

@BillCody You actually wrote “try reading.” Do you appreciate how gratuitously rude that comes across?
I really can’t wait for twitter’s edit function.
@LAVeganNative Yeah, it’s different.
@McFaul I think this is difficult because you’ve probably never had an “abusive” boss. But having had a just god-awful boss at the UN, who made Ted Stevens (a previous mean boss) look like a kitten, I can attest that abuse exists. But it is hard to define genetically.
Having said all of that, I also think some people ARE whiners, they expect jobs to be cushy, and they get upset any time they’re called out for doing a bad job. So the devil is in the details as to what kind of abuse you’re actually alleging. https://t.co/FJgsrF1d6M
Having had an abusive boss at UNDP, &amp; not talking about it a lot in public, I can attest that you fear sounding like a troublemaker who no one else will want to hire, and it’s hard to pin down, but it’s almost a little embarrassing that you let someone else abuse you like that. https://t.co/bZVK7xyDRs
The definition question is a good one, because some people would consider what you wrote as abusive, and I’d disagree; a boss’ occasional anger is not per se abuse. A boss berating you for attending a family member’s funeral, as my boss at UNDP, is abusive. It’s often a pattern. https://t.co/JWcgWnTPcc

@sonersones The thing is, it’s a fine line. I don’t want to be offering criticism that can undercut a climate deal. But at the same time, if the current proposal itself undercuts that final deal, then I think those of us who want this issue addressed have a duty to speak out.

@philritz1 And, her climate talking points forced us to spend the week talking about an issue totally unrelated to climate. That’s what happens when you include your bucket list of unrelated wishes in your first bill.
@JamesCoston Twitter, my ass. This is today’s left!
PS Someone shared an article saying we need free health care &amp; college, guaranteed housing &amp; jobs, to make up for the disruption of addressing climate change. 		Maybe. But we have a hard time explaining how to pay for 1 of those. And we’re gonna do all  simultaneously?	13/
And a final point: We are talking about permanently destroying our planet. It is not only imperative that we address climate change, it is imperative that we do it right. No excuses. This is too imperative to get wrong. So let’s make sure we get it right. 12/
If the socialist left is going to doctor videos in order to attack Dems like Sen. Feinstein for not offering a full-throated endorsement of the Green New Deal, then let's have a serious talk about what's in the Green New Deal and why she &amp; others might not be fully on board. 11/
So I'd like to know the strategic reason why the Green New Deal ignores LGBT people, and why it includes free health care and education, and guaranteed jobs &amp; housing, for all, when those proposals have nothing do with stopping climate change and saving all life on earth. 10/
And the corollary to that argument: You're going to spend a lot of time defending all those other proposals that have nothing to do with climate change, when you should be spending your time and money defending a bill to address climate change. 9/
Another reason you don't add unrelated proposal to your bill: It provides more reasons for people to oppose it. Someone might be for saving all life on the planet, but they're still not sure about free college, healthcare, and guaranteed jobs &amp; housing for everyone. 8/
We spent days talking about whether Democrats think people “unwilling” to work should be guaranteed a govt income, INSTEAD OF talking about climate change. That’s one reason you don’t include unrelated proposals in the Green New Deal. It gets you off topic, fast. 7/
Consider the hiccup during the recent roll-out of the Green New Deal. AOC’s staff shared the wrong FAQ with media, and posted it on her House Web site. The story blew up, but WHAT in particular blew up? The promise to pay people who are unwilling to work, unrelated to climate.	6/
Now, as someone who thinks we HAVE to address climate, why wouldn’t I want the left to throw the kitchen sink of legislative wish lists, even if they’re unrelated to climate change, in the Green New Deal? Because it’s a great way to kill the bill.		5/
The Green New Deal also promises that every job created will be a union job. Again, that’s nice, but it, along with throwing in Medicare for All, free college, guarantee jobs and housing for everyone, seems like a way to guarantee most GOP never support the legislation.		4/
The Green New Deal says we’re going to honor all past treaties with indigenous peoples. What does that mean exactly, what are the practical implications, and what does this have to do with climate change?		3/ https://t.co/bA1Z5sUoqn
Why does the Green New Deal, legislation about saving the world from climate change, include a promise of universal health care, stopping jobs from going overseas, and guaranteed job, higher ed &amp; housing for everyone? Those are nice things, but why are they in a climate bill?		2/ https://t.co/3gKxoXByjt

@MarciaBunney @speculawyer I’m fine with the socialist left rabble-rousing on climate to expand the Overton window. But they shouldn’t be leading the charge on substance or strategy, because that’s not their expertise and they’re already making mistakes.
The way they edited the video, it looks like Feinstein walks out and yells at the kids and then leaves. That’s not what happened. It was a 15-20 minute visit that went pretty well. I watched the whole thing. This kind of editing reeks of James O’Keefe. Who did this? https://t.co/M6qqmlIXxS
@BlondMsKang @kredzsays Does she discuss federal policy with them often? She clearly doesn’t have the knack. Regardless, the video was heavily edited to suggest something that is was way worse than what actually happened. And that’s what James O’Keefe does, and I don’t like it.

The Mueller Probe for Dummies, with guest Garrett Graff (18 Feb 19)’  https://t.co/OenfYxwLyO
@ddssff No, I mean the customers, would they know it’s human trafficking rather than a spa that gives happy endings?
@Dara_resist Duh. The CNN story said nothing about trafficking.
@MerovingianOne I know that now. The CNN story I read said nothing about that. Which is odd, now that I know the whole story via the NYT.
@modified_waffle @HelenKennedy I’m never going to hear from you again, so it’s not really a big deal.
The CNN story has nothing about this being about human trafficking, just fyi. NYT, which I found later, did. https://t.co/UdStHbkqf3 https://t.co/T9q61TVNW2
@Jamestoupin Before I block you, I’m going to let you apologize for being incredibly rude. You wouldn’t spoke to someone like this in person. The story I read didn’t mention human trafficking. Why did you assume it did? Why always assume the worst in the people, then act rudely based on it?
I now see in another story — the CNN story was not clear about this — that the issue is human trafficking, the women were basically held against their will as sex slaves.		I am curious if the men (and women?) frequenting the spa knew this, however. https://t.co/05wJ01uB5X
@tishightime Yes. I. Read. The. CNN. Story. That. Didn’t. Make. This. Clear. Why. Do. You. Assume. Otherwise?
@rawtwo I read that part of the NYT story that he went after others for minor offenses, so yes that could be an issue
@HelenKennedy Okay, then it’s a human trafficking story. But would the clients know that?
@MaryannaKlahn1 that’s a given. Or any trafficking.
And another thing, the police have video tape? Just how many innocent people also got video taped by the Florida police while nude and having a massage? https://t.co/FGAjp7VEZi

2) What does worry me is Trump committing more treason at the summit with Kim — as he did last time they met, when Trump stopped US military exercises at the suggestion of Putin! If Trump announces further pro-Putin policies will they get buried by the Mueller news?
1) So Trump is meeting North Korean dictator Kim right before the Mueller report drops. Will North Korea step on Mueller, or will Mueller step on North Korea? I suspect the latter, since we all know NOTHING substantive other than bad news is going to come from the summit.

5) We had a particularly interesting exchange about journalistic objectivity. I asked Karem whether, being so outspoken about Trump, he could be objective. His answer was fascinating.
4) We talked to Karem about that first briefing with Sean Spicer (BIGGEST CROWD EVER!), about “Holocaust relocation centers,” how Trump got elected (“there’s a large number of people who are nuts”), why Trump’s attacks on the media matter, Betty Ford, and more.
3) Among the nuggets from our interview with Brian Karem: “The biggest legacy of Ronald Reagan is that asshole Mitch McConnell.”		On Trump: “Most of what he’s done is an abomination.” 		On the lesson he learned from his mentor Helen Thomas: “Just ask the question.”
2) Karem is funny, outspoken, genuine, and comes across as an old-school gumshoe reporter who shares a lot of opinions about Reagan, the Bushes, Clinton, Obama &amp;  Trump, but utlimately, he’s just there to do his job and get the facts.
@Johanna_Ann Seriously. What kind of idiot would do that? Makes me wonder if maybe the check was for something else — I mean, that’s just dumb. Unless he thought there’s no way they’d catch the guys.

I suspect the Chicago Police have some independent corroboration of the Nigerian-American brothers’ accusation against Jussie Smollett, otherwise I’d be surprised they’d charge him simply based on an an accusation.

@nicksmithnews IF he lied, I agree. I’m still holding out hope — perhaps the wrong word — that he’s telling the truth.  But it really really really doesn’t feel that way.
@peaceplay That’s part of the reason we believed him.
@jdzlindeed2 I just gave my thoughts. I'm pissed.
5) Everyone who defended Smollett is starting to look like an idiot. Everyone who bit their tongue, like me, when we smelled a rat in this story early on, is starting to look like an idiot.		I’m still biting my tongue, until we learn more. But so help me god, if he lied…
4) So where are we now? If Smollett lied, I hope he’s punished to the full extent of the law. He has set LGBT rights back. He has set the rights of African-Americans back. He’s undercut actual hate crimes victims, who won’t be believed in the future. And he’s empowered Trump.
3) Still, I didn’t believe Smollett, I smelled major holes in his story,  yet I gave him a pass. In part because he might have been telling the truth. And in part because I just didn’t have the energy to deal with the mob that I knew would descend on me if I questioned his story.
2)…I’ve disagreed with those who demand we “believe the victim” on 1st hearing any accusation. Smollett’s case is a case study in why that approach is wrong. DO take victims seriously. Investigate their accusations RIGOROUSLY. But don’t reach conclusions until we have more info.
1) God damn him. At this point, I don’t know what to believe. But I will say, I’ve worked on LGBT rights issues, including a lead role publicizing the Matthew Shepard story, and Smollett’s accusations rang untrue from day one. I didn’t say anything because even though… https://t.co/yVtN3Hy1He

@sockmonkeysusie @GW_MFA LOL there is no doctor’s office. I can go to the front desk of the department, but I know what that’s gonna be like. Nonetheless, I probably have no choice at this point.
@Asabovsobelo I’ll ask the new doc, but I’m still concerned that the new doc will have NO way of contacting the old doc.
You can also hear an excerpt of our “Trump-Russia for Dummies” interview with Garrett Graff on iTunes: https://t.co/o4WbLm4WES https://t.co/zQFEFsQmL4
@FultertonAW I’ll call the new doc tomorrow and see if they have any idea, but I’ll bet you they have no one to send it to, we’ll see.
@Asabovsobelo In fact, I’ve rarely needed a form. I’ve done it by phone or via email, a lot in the past. And I mean a lot.
@FultertonAW @GW_MFA No. I give their fax to my doctor’s office, but of course there’s no one to give them to. Mind you, there’s no one for the new doc to get a hold of anyway at GW, who’s he gonna call? They don’t accept phone calls.
@mmeyer115comcas I’m clearly going to have to, which is ridiculous. I have to spend $20+ on Uber, and an hour of my time, just to ask them to send my files to another doc?
@NickMarcello2 It’s not that easy in a small town when you need a specialist. That was obviously already a consideration. Not many options.
@gauthamrao It’s really awful. My favor was when I was undergoing some therapy there 3x a week, and they had some issues so they could only book me 2x a week, even though my doc said I needed 3x. What was I supposed to do? No idea.
@mmeyer115comcas LOL MyChart. Yes, you can use my chart to contact your doctor and he won’t read the message. And there’s nothing on my chart to actually send your records to another doc.
@GW_MFA 3) Who designs a medical facility where they don’t use phones, and the only way to communicate with your doc is by email that they don’t ever look at?		We have the worst health care system in the world in this country.
2) I need to have them send my medical records to another doc in town, and there’s literally NO WAY for me to do that because they don’t take phone calls, and there’s no electronic way to request it or contact them. WTF @GW_MFA?
1) Does anybody else have any of their doctors at GW in DC? I have one there, and it’s so frustrating because they don’t take phone calls at GW. Everything is online. You can email your doc, but they won’t see the message for literally weeks. And there’s NO ONE to call.

@NewsPolitics I’ve always pushed back against people who say “believe the victim.” Don’t dismiss the victim, yes, but don’t just believe them because they claim something. Take it seriously, is my mantra. Which means, try not to publicly undercut hate crime allegations if you can.
@NewsPolitics Yes, but when the cops are investigating, I try to bite my tongue on a crime so heinous. I expressed some doubt, but very little. Trust me, privately I had a whole essay of doubts written in my head.
@scotinus There was.

@DearDara Oh, with Gillibrand it’s not gender. She shifted big time on guns, immigration and LGBT rights in order to move from the House to the Senate. As a gay man, that gives me concern. She has always struck me as opportunistic. I agree with @frankrichny on this one.

@MSVintageValues That’s for sure! But there is a risk that you define yourself early as something other than climate change.
3) It feels like all the other proposals detract from the very real danger of climate change.
2) I’m not necessarily against a lot of it, but I can’t imagine any Republican who could ever endorse this. I also imagine a lot of Americans wouldn’t endorse this. I’m legitimately curious about the choice to dump every liberal dream project into the Green New Deal.
1) Just read the Green New Deal resolution. I thought this was just about climate change. The resolution also guarantees job for everyone, free education, housing, health care, affordable food, honoring all indigenous treaties, stop sending jobs overseas, promoting unions.

If Trump is going to demand a huge electoral concession from us, like the wall — something that will hugely benefit him in the 2020 election — then we need to demand a huge electoral concession from him. And that’s not beds for migrants.
Provided I get something good in return, I’m not opposed to paying some for barriers — I’m not a fan of purity police. BUT this deal sounds kind of weak tea. Fewer beds? The wall is a HUGE concession that massively helps Trump’s re-election. We should be getting more than beds. https://t.co/J1HMumiNvq

3) The compromise when you want me to give you something and I don’t want to give it isn’t that I give you half of it. It’s that I give you some of what you want, and then you give me something you don’t want to give me. E.g., DACA and full support of ACA.
2) But I just saw CNN suggest that the compromise “has” to be some wall funding. And that’s not true. No. You get “some” wall funding when we’re both for the wall, but you want twice as much as me, then we split the difference. Not when you want it and I don’t.
1) The “compromise” is not “pay half Trump’s ransom demand” for the wall. An actual compromise is if we pay for something we don’t want to pay for, then Trump has to endorse something he doesn’t want to endorse. Could be the ACA &amp; DACA, other possibilities.

Bezos keeps mentioning Saudi Arabia in his Medium piece accusing AMI/National Enquirer of trying to blackmail him. What is he suggesting exactly? Is he accusing AMI of blackmailing him to get him to stop covering Khashoggi, or covering AMI’s ties to Saudi? Was unclear to me. https://t.co/NrIrogzqWh

3) Now that doesn’t necessarily make it right in retrospect. But the CNN reporter invoked the mores of the era in an effort to determine how offensive the actions were. And a lot of this stuff was way more acceptable when I was a kid than it is today. Doesn’t make it right.
2) I ask because a lot of these issues are tempered in part depending on the times in which they happened. It was never okay to appear in a photo with a klansman in the early 1980s. But dress as a black musician? That was probably was more acceptable at the time.
1) Wait, a CNN reporter just said that dressing as a black musician in the 1980s was long since past the time that such things were acceptable. Is that true? Was it widely “unacceptable” for white people to be made up as black musicians in the early 1980s?

@BrianKarem Next in line is the following: Governor, Lt Gov, Att Gen and the GOP Speaker of the House of Delegates, who would become governor if they all resign and then appoint new GOP Lt Gov and Att Gen.

2) We should always take alleged victims seriously. But we shouldn’t convict — either legally or in the public sphere — alleged wrongdoers, regardless of the alleged wrongdoing, without a pretty high threshold of proof.
1) Actually, the lawyer in me would add a caveat. Perhaps most people have no reason to lie in such a situation, but they absolutely positively have the potential to get the story wrong, and think they’re aggrieved when they’re not. The Aziz Ansari mess comes to mind. https://t.co/LHotbij2GL

@MrDonFrances Actually, if you can’t get something passed then it doesn’t matter if it’s good.
@MrDonFrances ACA wasn’t bad.
5) The same people giving us election advice when they haven’t won many elections are now giving us policy advice when they haven’t passed much policy.   They not only don’t know what works, they don’t know how to get it passed into law. So color me skeptical.
4) I’m all for folks having a robust debate about which policy is best, with “best” also meaning “which one can we get passed.” But it feels like the purity-police who helped F up 2016 are now also f’g up policy debates. And that scares me.
3) I hate our system of health care in this country. And I thank God for the ACA, without which I wouldn’t have health insurance because of pre-existing conditions. The ACA was imperfect and it was also a god-send, and far better than getting nothing because we refused to settle.
2) Some on the left like purity politics where we all compete as to how far left we can go. Sometimes the best solution isn’t the one that goes farthest to the far left. France &amp; UK both still have private health insurance. So it’s not necessary dealbreaker having some private.
1) Actually, good health care reform is what you can get passed, not what you wish you could get passed. The socialist left likes to stake out extreme positions, but that doesn’t mean the most extreme position is always the best position or the one most likely to become law. https://t.co/ICxubGZkcy

Private insurance hasn’t been eliminated in France, and they have a great national health care system. It’s not a requirement. And honestly, who cares? We’re gonna nitpick the details? https://t.co/2hbQAubcWA
I’m listening to Trump’s impromptu presser in the Oval Office, and it’s still remarkable what a pathological liar he is. I don’t think he said a single thing that was actually true.

3) In the end, what ended up being the most popular part of the ACA? Pre-existing conditions protections that benefit everyone. This is about marketing. It’s about how you sell policy to the public. It has to be seen as benefiting them.
2) One of the biggest flaws of the ACA marketing campaign was talking all the time about the uninsured who would get insurance. Yes, that’s a HUGE benefit of the problem, and it’s something most Americans probably don’t care about as much as THEIR OWN COVERAGE.

Dolphin plays with dog. Adorable. https://t.co/540pIjBk0y
@SaraBellum7 As a lawyer, and a professional writer, it reads to me like a lawyer wrote it.
@yonatanb I wasn’t going to devote an entire tweet to the lunatics.
@SuarezMiami Yes, Danny. It’s a fine line between being a 30 year civil rights advocate and a copy who beats black and latino you.		You feeling okay today?
I guess it makes sense the twitter bots are defending the kids. Putting aside the racism for a moment, they were wearing MAGA hats, that alone is enough. https://t.co/XMCR6Ji4V9
@asydlow81 Imagine being a chaperone of a group of high school boys and thinking it would be okay to let them get into a shouting match with a group of somewhat loony protesters.
@MrGomez6204 Oh I’m agreeing with you. And that’s exactly right. When you hear the peanuts voice, it’s not because the kids love you and respect you and are trying to make things better. You and I know exactly what that face means, or at least what it does not mean.
@MrGomez6204 Right, and is it the look, as the kid said, of a child trying to defuse a situation by putting on a happy face to signal “everything is okay, I don’t want trouble”?		That’s what he said last night. Is that what your kids do on a routine basis? Smile to defuse? Please.
Had you bothered researching the story you’d find out that the boys and the Israel-fan-loons were harassing each other and the Native American elder got between the two groups and sang a prayer song. Had he said the Lord’s Prayer you’d not be writing this. https://t.co/ounThmbgdM
It’s interesting how many Twitter accounts created in just the last few months are now defending the Catholic boys who mocked the native American elder yesterday at the Lincoln Memorial. https://t.co/y4eazHp4JD
I was 16. And I’ve had grown up MAGA types do that exact stance to me, just a few months ago, outside the White House. The guy got a few inches away from my face, daring me to hit him. It’s a familiar bully ploy. https://t.co/ax66vUjgpj

1) The notion that the 16 y.o. didn’t smirk menacingly in the Native American elder’s face, but rather, smiled to defuse the situation, is something a 16 y.o. would say to explain away his bullying behavior after the fact.  Watch the video. https://t.co/27069QXOXD https://t.co/ASWEjCAAvM
Someone defending the Catholic boys, and arguing that they weren’t mocking the Native Americans, needs to explain why they were making tomahawk gestures. Why they were chanting “build a wall” at them. Why the one boy got in the Native American elder’s face and smirked non-stop. https://t.co/zJVQV5uxFh

@connie897 Even for an adult, that’s a well-written statement. As a lawyer, the style looks very familiar to me.
