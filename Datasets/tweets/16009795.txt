All you San Diegans who are going to your grocery stores today, puh-leeze check and see if there is any Throwback Pepsi on the shelf.
@souplantation Of course San Diego!  1978
@kworkman Yes, the Throwback Pepsi is made with sugar, not high fructose corn syrup...
@jacklynk No, the Throwback Pepsi that I bought was only in cans.  It says Throwback up and down the can...Thanks for looking!
If anyone here in San Diego sees Throwback Pepsi in their local market, would you please tweet the location? Thanks!

@rockstarjen Whoa, I just re-read your post! ROFL! That definitely could be a "public" relations nightmare!  Ha!
@rockstarjen Yeah, I just realized another common one.  Every time I type "to the", it comes out "tot he"! Fingers work faster than brain!

I can't think of anyone here on Twitter who would tolerate neighbor throwing limbs over into their yard. I trim & dispose of their hedge!
@BlueFlameDesign Yeah, forget the law...let's talk about old-fashioned neighborliness and courtesy? Where'd that go?
@sdbargainmama Never heard of the COPPS program but I'll look it up.  My sister is a paralegal & can help me out too.
We will also no longer be taking trash out night before to be considerate. Consideration of neighbors is two-way street!
You know what?  Our garage is right next to idiot neighbors bedroom & huz has been considerate about starting Harley in street. NO MORE!
Tried to calmly talk to idiot neighbor & show him California law re: trees & he tore it up in my face. I calmly tried to reason w/ idiot.
Furious w/ our stupid neighbor who thinks it's alright to trim branches of tree & throw dead branches over fence. California law says no!

@icowboy At last!  Someone who is content!  Yay!  It IS possible then?
Feedback please...I want an HONEST answer to this. Is your current job what you would chooose to do for a living if you had a choice?
@sdtips Is it "yes" for the freedom it allows but "no" for the constant need to generate income?
@kgroovy Now YOU seem to be doing what a LOT of people WISH they could do, so I'm surprised at your answer.  Too labor intensive?
Am I wrong in thinking that most ppl in 8-5 jobs want to be self-employed & most self-employed ppl wish they had 8-5 job?
OK, I want an HONEST answer to this. Is your current job what you would chooose to do for a living if you had a choice?

@HJOsio Another question, did your realtor refer you to a lender before they showed you houses or did you get prequalified first?
@SDMike Sorry to hear about iTunes fiasco. That's why I burned backup CD's of my library. Hope someone can help you fix! Jeez!
@HJOsio Yeah, a lot of people find a realtor from open houses but most get referrals (like @cbadJamie, @healthyfeelgirl, & @steveblessing)
Had yummy Chicken Pot Pie & awesome service from JaNai at Mimi's Santee. Thanks!
I am not looking for a realtor. I just want to know how most people "find" the person they end up working with...

@nrek Do the "Nerds" taste goofy?
Just imagine being without your main computer! The frustration I feel with Norton & their lack of responsibility for causing it is maddening
@mobienthusiast I tried the unplugging thing but didn't count to 60.  I'll give it (and any other suggestions) a try! Thanks!
@4taleza If you think Hooley's was good this weekend, you should go see it tonight! Joel & Dave are both doing good jobs managing them!
OK, so I'm looking for hints/help on what to do if keyboard and mouse no longer respond to CPU. Stupid Norton tech geek somehow disconnected
I should have known to ask the "Twitter" community which Antivirus to use! I never would have bought Norton, that's for sure!
Norton is not accepting responsibility for their actions. Even though computer worked fine BEFORE they started deleting things. Don't buy it
I had a Norton Antivirus tech remove some virus from my main home computer & somehow they removed mouse & keyboard responses too! Arghhh!!
@bloodstock Well, I'll make exception for those obsessed with monkeybusiness!  LOL!
I feel like you can promote your agenda but still interact with others. U wouldn't go to party & blah, blah, blah only about your biz.
AND, I'm going to review those I'm following and if ALL U do is promote your BIZ or website, DROP! I suggest the rest of U do the same.
I don't "get" these people who have over a thousand followers but hardly follow anyone back. Sorry, if I'm not "worthy"...then neither are U

@bloodstock After that, any time we were watching any sporting event - we used to say "And HERE COMES QUICKEN TREE!" cuz it was miraculous!

I didn't know Blue Herons were monogamous. Did U see sdtips Tip of the Week about those lovebirds? http://www.sandiegotraveltips.com/
Just heard story of local pilot Joe Zofoletta who tragically died in the NY plane crash. So sad for family who lost a fine young man. RIP
@jenscloset Yes, you MUST go if you are out that way. It is WAY better than the Ellen show and Ellen staff (who are just awful).
@MadeFreshDaily For V-day, we're having lots of friends over for Bunco which always is a lot of laughs. And guys compete more than girls!
@jenscloset I went to the Bonnie Hunt show and actually spoke to her. It was the first day she'd brought dogs from shelter. She's great!
Just got followed by @pointbreakcafe in OB. I had their award winning chowder a few mos ago and highly recommend it. Try it on Fridays! Yum!

How many of you have sold things through Craigslist, ebay or other means?  How was it?
I experienced the power of Craigslist today.  Sold my washer and dryer in minutes. Unbelievable! Hmm..what else can I sell?
@DowntownRob LOL!  Well, no cellar...so I guess I'm relegated to the closet.  But eventually one must come out of the closet...or so I hear!
@THE_REAL_SHAQ The rumor is that they were Wheaties with White Stuff on them...'fess up!  LOL!
@DowntownRob My husband's friend tells him that one day he's gonna open the closet during the day & find me hanging upside down!  LOL!
@DowntownRob Nope, I'm a nightowl too...all the cool people are (didn't you say that once?)!

@SDRadio North Island.  The sound was awesome.  Believe me, that movie had a lot of "startling" loud sounds!  Cheesh!
Finally saw Valkyrie at the base theatre. I don't think they could have pulled a better performance out of those actors. Well done!
@san_dyego Rocky's is in Pacific Beach - Here's more info: http://tinyurl.com/cjqnt7
Rocky's still makes a killer burger.  Glad to know they haven't changed their formula for success.  Yum!
How many of  you saw Will Smith in Seven Pounds? Just saw it tonight...wow...deep...but good!
@NikkiStixxx You're right! (BTW, nice ink! Didja know that I met KatVonD yesterday...speaking of Nikki Sixx...?)
@MyMelodie  You're RIGHT! But I don't think we need to "make" LA come...LOL! They will come once they find out how FUN the SD people are! :)
@PinchMySalt Yeah, she asked me what it was, I told her & she asked me "So you think I should be on it?" I said "Hell yeah!" Ha!
It was fun to meet Kat VonD (tattoo artist from LA Ink) tonite at Borders. I told her she needed to get on Twitter! LOL!

@sdtips Glad the Spaghetti Factory came to their senses & moved back in.  What were they thinkin w/ their other food idea? C'mon! in SD?
These warm sunny days make me want to nursery already to get my summer plants but I know it's too soon.  Mother Nature is trying to fool me!
Just roasted my tomatoes and homegrown jalapenos to make a delicious batch of salsa.  Wow, even I'm impressed with myself - so tasty!
For you local San Diegans, if you're in Rancho San Diego, try Savannah Grill. They have a beautiful, open outdoor patio AND good food!
@scrapaddict I don't usually endorse movies but I'm gonna put this one in my top 10.  Everyone was talking about the movie on the way out...
@KrisBerg OK Kris, you got me!  ;)   (I wish...he was soooo good in this movie!  Better than BOND!)
Had a WONDERFUL dinner at the new Savannah Grill in Rancho SD last nite and then on to see "TAKEN" with Liam Neeson. BOTH were GREAT!!

@sdtips Let's not forget Carol Burnett!  soooo funny they cracked each OTHER up!  HA!
@sdtips Or when the Ricardos and Mertzes stay in crummy hotel by railroad track and innkeeper steals their steering wheel! Hilarious!
@sdtips ROBBBB!!! LOL!
OK, FAV ILLucy show was when Ricky wanted to teach her a lesson about being on TIME...yeah, that was it...
@sdtips And FAV I Love Lucy show was when Lucy locked herself in freezer! No, wait, licking the mayo labels one by one...no wait...
@sdtips I LOVE those shows! Remember when Laura was preggers & Dick practiced getting out of bed quickly? Sooo funny...
@SDMike But what did you think of the food at Stone? Meh...for me, anyway...gotta have both be good, ya know?
@cbsop Jerry, what do you do with your Pork Tenderloin? Just bought some on sale...
After cooking at home all week, decided to enjoy some good Machaca (Sonora style) at Mario's in La Mesa. Yum! Just like Nana's!
I think I need to tell @inyourkitchen about it in case she doesn't know about all the stuff she can buy from "back home"!
@juliewright & @madball911 Seriously,I can easily spend an hour in Major Market going up and down the aisles. Lots of UK & German stuff huh?
@RecipeGirl If he's like his Momma, he's a shoo-in for the gifted program!  :)
@carondg I  have a little something I picked up for you at Major Market.  I need to know when you'll be home in the coming week...
@AndreasRecipes I used to work at Great News! in Pacific Beach. We always had good feedback on those pans. I like my GreenPan...
That's not to say that I don't use words like that myself...but I save it for when I need IMPACT! It loses its punch when used so easily...
Oh by the way, if I unfollow you it might be because you use the "F" word too liberally. I'm sorry if I'm old-fashioned, just don't like it!
I had fun at an Estate Sale today.  Beautiful Oak and some depression glass. Lovely Hoosier that I would LOVE to have.  Oh well...
With so much anticipation for this special day, I'm kind of bummed that the revelry is over. I wish Obama all the best in his new job...
@kellypea I voted for you too, Kelly but truly, it was no contest. You rock!
Wow, I don't know how I got to over 400 followers already. It seems like I just joined twitter. Hmm, when DID I get addicted???  :)
Good to see Bob Woodruff reporting again - mostly recovered from his bombing injury. Such a great guy! Hooray for him!
@EveSieminski The chef at Inn at Rancho Santa Fe came in to have some of Kiki's cooking too. Kiki works there part time...awesome!
@EveSieminski Go upstairs and Kiki (head sous chef at open cooking area) will make you what you want. He is great!
@EveSieminski I think you need to give it another try. This new chef is determined to raise the level of quality of food
@Cooksbakesbooks Yeah and they have those cool sidecars! You don't see that very often, especially in those numbers!
Beach House chef treated us to new desserts made by him. Wonderful, mini apple tart with HOMEmade caramel sauce & authentic NY cheesecake!
Beach House restaurant in Cardiff has new chef. Friends agreed meal was wonderful at upstairs ocean overlook. Chef committed to quality food
Does anyone else think Jill Biden's coat is too short? I'll bet she wishes she picked a longer one...Brrrrr! Nice red color, though...

SD Tweeps - anyone going to the free inaugural ball at Hilton Bayfront tonight?
Watching reports that Kennedy is doing better after collapsing at luncheon. Good news...
@debpuchalla When it comes to baking, I will still use my good vanilla, Land O Lakes butter, etc. No scrimping - just less baking!
With this beautiful weather, we are taking the Harleys out for a ride along the coast. Lunch will be someplace with a nice view & good food!
@PlaneGravy Estate sales are always fun on last day. They mark stuff waaaay down. Found lots of good buys - cookbooks, china, etc. CHEAP!
@urbansolace My husband has tried every bread pudding in SD (it seems). We'll have to add yours to his list!
@sdtips Wouldn't you know that the DVR was full and we didn't get to see replay of Ellen show from Thursday? Again, that Murphy...follows me
@sdtips The dogs were a hoot! You would like going to that show. Of COURSE, they had giveaways on the days I didn't go! Murphy's law...
@carondg U would have loved Bonnie Hunt! She showed pix of chewed up "Dog Training" DVD/Booklet that dog Charlie ate! Remind U of anyone?
Well, since his beloved Chargers didn't make it to the Superbowl, my son in Tempe will be happy his 2nd fav team is going.  Go Cards!
@SaucyMamaCafe Where is the Fancy Food Show?  In 'Frisco? They had it here in San Diego last year (I think...)
Going to try to find some fresh fruit to put in a fruit basket for The Fisher House. Now that holidays are over, don't want to forget 'em!
Heading off to the Farmers Market and then to some Estate Sales. Half price day - hoping for some treasures!
Ellen show taping...meh...wouldn't go again. Her staff is blah...long wait. DID talk to Dr. from ER @ Starbucks. Cute Aussie!
I'm reading posts that Bonnie Hunt got pre-empted in certain cities. Could it be cuz Jennifer Beals (L" word) was guest? In this day & age?
Going to be SURE that the DVR has room to tape Bonnie Hunt today.  Saw the taping yesterday in LA.  Too funny! About dogs!
Am at Warner Bros studio to see Ellen show. Tomorrow Bonnie Hunt! YAY!
Is anyone buying Spring Training tickets to the Padres?  We usually go see them play the Mariners.  Love the stadium & closeness.
@kalynskitchen Have any of you sent a message to @twitter or wordpress to remove Amy? She has violated terms of service by impersonanating
@carondg Tomorrow is stents.  Cataract surgery will happen in early March. Looking forward to seeing newly completed Sharp Hospital.
@kalynskitchen or...maybe not....guess Amy is still around.  Darn!
@kalynskitchen Looks like Twitter banned Amysrecipes.
@kalynskitchen
OK, maybe we could have a chance if the refs wouldn't just be blatant in their poor coverage.  C'mon!
Pass interference?  Get some glasses!
We've had the ball only .17 seconds this half...yikes! We need a TD!
REJECTED at the goal line!  C'mon...capitalize on your efforts!  We need a touchdown!
We can't beat the Steelers AND bad ref calls!  Jeez!
Sorry...am un-following all who live in San Diego and are not loyal Bolts fans! That is just WRONG!
Geez!  How much time are you going to give Roethlisberger!  D-FENSE!  D-FENSE!
Woo hoo!  Chargers 10, Pits - 7!
Ok Chargers...show 'em you can run it all the way back too!
Guess Steelers didn't want to take a chance of Sproles running it back...Wimps!
@Inyourkitchen Yes, we need to get together.  I wanna hear what's going on...you have so many balls in the air!  Yikes!
My cousins are DIE HARD Steelers fans!  Sorry, you should be loyal to the Chargers - you live in SAN DIEGO territory!
Woo hoo!  Chargers have the lead!
@JenMitch All the commentators have been wrong!  They will be wrong again!  (I hope...LOL!)
Eli Manning...you made a "GIANT" mistake not coming to play for San Diego Chargers!  Ha Ha!!
Eli just threw an interception to an Eagles player. Hey Eli, wanna get away? Come to San Diego with Peyton and take a hike. Weather's sweet!
@carondg My Aunt (& parents) are on their way up here.  Surgery tomorrow on my Aunt. But first...watch the game...divert attention/nerves

@carondg Lunch was great!  Everything tasty and fresh.  We were there til 2:30 so I didn't think you were still at your lunch place...
@Jeters Oh YES!  That sounds right up my alley!  In fact, we're having handmade tortillas at lunch today!  Yum!  THANKS!
@Jeters Can't go wrong with Mexican! Let me know name/location...please!  :)
Need recs on hotels to stay in near Warner Bros. Studio.  Got tickets to Ellen show - wanna stay overnight.  Anyone familiar up there?
@jaconsultants Maybe those loos are victims of spontaneous combustion!  All that gas and all...  LOL!
@carondg Still dealing with health issues.  Next up:  cataract surgery then she will be getting stents.  Or maybe vice versa. So many issues
@carondg Hope your Mom is home and feeling better. My trips out of town to help family are draining but someone has to step up...sigh!
@debpuchalla OMG, just got back in town & reading about your new job! Wow! Congrats! Nervous? Does this mean only 4 hrs. sleep per nite?
@carondg I'll sign up to FB FP too.  I have the papers...I was debating the merits of joining but now I have a reason. Ha! :)
Finally washed my black car today. So nice! Everytime I was going to - forecast was for rain. It'd better not rain for at least a week now!
My son who lives in Louisville watched the game with a bunch of Colts fans.  Guess who was jumping up and down at end of game? Ha!
OMG! OMG! I don't know if my heart can take it!  The Chargers win AGAIN!  WooHoo!  Puh-leeze let us win all the way to the Super Bowl!
@carondg Happy New Year! No, I wasn't planning on joining for DimSum.  I RSVP'd...did you not receive my reply?
@Burger_Lounge You're welcome!  And much continued success in 2009!!  :)
Well, I guess he was wrong.  We won! We won! What an exciting, fulfilling game to watch. Officiating has been terrible this yr. But we won!
Several weeks ago, huz told me the Chargers were out of the playoffs. Impossible cuz Denver has to lose every game & we have to win every 1!
That bugs me when someone follows me and I click on their profile and they have protected their updates.  Block!
Felt better this evening and went to see Marley & Me. Now I know who my dog Sandy reminds me of...LOL!
@rayrena Yeah, I don't think something spicy would feel good if I needed to get rid of it in a hurry, know whut I mean?  LOL!
@sdtips Ju know it!  Already did Airborne and Alleve.  Any other remedies? Maybe chicken soup from DZ Akins? Good "Mom" remedy I hear
@carondg Oh I wasn"t talking about today. No way am I leaving house today. Bleh!
@tonyfarley You don't want to set up Auto Follow.  Many feel that it is annoying and meaningless. Wait to see if you want to follow them 1st
Hoping that I don't have the flu.  Rough night last night and achy all over this morning. Jeez, not NOW! Have stuff to do!
@sdtips But I am the same way, so we are two peas in a pod as far as that goes... Ha!
@sdtips You are photogenic, but just camera-phobic.  I don't know why - the last 3 times, I've seen great shots of you.  U are harsh critic.
@carondg Saw some beautiful salmon at Whole Foods yesterday.  I'll buy us some if you make the Gravlax.  Good trade??  :)
@carondg Was soooo mad at myself for leaving good size package of Nova lox in shopping bag overnite. Waste of good money! Arghhh!
@carondg Huz & friends went back to give another try...fries were great.  Hot, flavorful...but milkshakes came when we were almost done.
@Burger_Lounge You have great food and I've enjoyed both visits very much (Kensington)! Just wish milkshakes came B4 food.  Work on that, K?
Pastries are from Panchits...25th and C
@carondg A little running around to the grocery stores and to drop off gifts to friends, which include you...I'll give you plenty of notice
There was a big bus with dry ice/fog with Polar Express blazoned on the side in Pt. Loma tonight with revelers inside.  Seen it?
@carondg Radio show tomorrow?  What are your plans Wed?
THANKS to all for the messages and DM's wishing me a happy birthday. Now on with the 2nd half of my life.  So much to do, so little time...
GREAT impromptu dinner with huz and @sdtips & @jaconsultants at Filippi's in Little Italy. Thanks for making my Birthday special!
People have been so nice to me today..Keith at Trader Joe's La Mesa was so helpful, Michelle at Pat & Oscar's in CV gave me more breadsticks
Just because people are rich, doesn't mean they have good taste in clothes...Who dresses these people?  Jackie O, Audrey H. come back!!!
Beverly Hills is full of Lucite Platform (or heel) shoes.  Guess it is the latest trend, eh?  Looks goofy, sorry...
Happy B-day to jaconsultants today!  Have a great day, Alex!  Sounds like a fun agenda!!!!
My B-day is Tuesday.  The big 5-0!  I'm gonna be a golden girl (AARP card and all!)...
Guess I'll have to hit up Chowhound to give recs for reasonably priced dinner tonight in area.  Does Bev. Hills do reasonably priced?
I've been given an opportunity to stay at a foo-foo resort in Beverly Hills tonight with my niece and sister! Woo-hoo! B-day celebration!
@chrishansen But I also know that people were lied to by loan officers, absolutely lied to. But...3% for 30 years? No questioning of that??
@chrishansen If judges & officers seem unfeeling, it is because they KNOW these people got multiple warnings of what was going to come.
@chrishansen Chris, have U asked the question: What did you do with all the money you NEVER SENT TO THE LENDER? MONTHS of NO payments???
Due to diversity of marriages in family there are Mexican, Russian, Japanese and good ole' American recipes in new cookbook. Fun!
Finally received my Family Cookbook that I spent the last year on. Nothing fancy, just good recipes from family of great cooks... :)
@debpuchalla Have a french toast casserole that is prepped nite b4 & baked in the AM for guests. Go to cooking.com & search in forum for it.
@sdtips  Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday to YOUUUUU!  Or, as they say in my hometown "Apio Verde to Ju"
@carondg P.S. I will not be attending dim sum tweetup.  Sounds like a lot of fun.  Next gathering for sure!
@carondg I had a hunch and called them to confirm.  I have seen it there before...
@RecipeGirl You can get pancetta at Jonathan's in La Jolla or Harvest Ranch mkt in Encinitas for $11.99 lb sliced to your thickness.
@debpuchalla LOL, Deb!  Did you carry a potato in your pocket to keep yourself warm? Ha! So what happens now with kiddos? Take to work?
@jerryrice Thanks for that. It's been so fun to watch you on TV since meeting you and I wish you the best that you deserve, cuz you do...
@jerryrice I've told the story many times to ppl about how gracious you & Emmitt were at the Stan Humphries golf tourney I was working at...
When you put appetizers out at a party, which one is the first to go?
@KellyOrange How was your dinner at Oceanaire?  Report please...
@carondg Someone said that Twitter did a cleanup of spammers and some people lost followers. Maybe that is why...
@carondg Glad to hear the news!  My Aunt got news that her tumor wasn't cancer either.  It will be a good year after all!  :)
San Diego tweeps - Anyone ever eaten at Blanca in Solana Beach?  Any recommendations?
@debpuchalla You seem more at ease & fun since adding new name. Didja feel restricted when tied to your job title? Anyway, fun new  you!  :)
@CarolynJung Well, the important thing is that he was nice to you all and I will give him the benefit of the doubt that he is that way... :)
For those who wanted to do something for Fisher House, they could really use a fruit basket to leave on counter for family members.
@RecipeGirl Fisher House probably has enough cookies to last through early next week, if you want to make some in time for Xmas.
@thesmitten Thanks for the peek into the "library" at MS.  I wish I had a lending card there!
@carondg OK, now I know how the guy in the doorway knew we were food bloggers having lunch at K.  you were tweeting while there!!!
@chrishansen PLUS, most of your journalist peers use Twitter (sometimes even on air!). And NO, I do not work for them... :)
@chrishansen Chris, I'm telling ya, ya need to just stick with Twitter.  I knew Pownce would fail. Twitter is the growing one
So I'd read a few days ago that Pownce shut down.  No surprise to me - it was nothing like Twitter (IMO). This is easier to use!
@lorenaruggero I wish I'd known you were going.  I was done with the book and am turning it in...It will be there tomorrow.
@StickyGooeyChef This has been a hard year for a lot of us, but I think you got more than your share of sorrow this yr. So sad to hear news.
@SDRadio It's definitely a quick read.  I think it is worth your time...let me know what you think once you've read it...
@KristenKouk It's called CAMP BOW WOW. Looked neat with internet monitoring available. How weird that you would ask...article is old, old
@KristenKouk I was JUST reading old newspapers & saw article about Doggie Day Camp. It's in El Cajon but is a franchise. Maybe 1 near you?
@lorenaruggero La Mesa, in between new fire station and old post office.  Very light, bright and airy.
D@rubenorozco You're not on my DM dropdown...hmmm
@SDRadio I don't know him - I don't listen to talk radio.
@rubenorozco Does the Wynn coupon come with a catch?  Like listening to some pitch about their timeshare? If not, I could sure use it!
So no one has read "The Christmas Sweater"?  I think you should...especially if you are down about what you have in life...
@carondg LOL!  That's right Caron.  @inyourkitchen needs to get to the MEAT of the MATTER!  How'd it go with THAT GUY?
@Inyourkitchen OK, gotta give more details as we wonder, wonder, wonder about your trip. Take airborne. Prolly got sick from airplane ride.
Has anyone else read Glenn Beck's "The Christmas Sweater"?  It's an easy read - finished it last night after visiting new library in town.
@CarolynJung And he was so snotty on Martha Stewart show but that just may be his French-i-ness (LOL!).
@CarolynJung I just remember on Top Chef how he was so condescending to one of my favorites (Brian Malarkey). He said some stupid things
@LindaEskin People are oblivious to signs.  Go with the towels and MAYBE they'll see them and say "Hmm, wonder why THAT'S there?"  LOL!
@MayorSanders WooHoo!  Good news on firepits! Thanks Mayor for having the wisdom to hire someone to be your Twitter persona - love it!
Darn, I KNEW I should have cleaned the leaves out of the gutter this past weekend.  Man, it is POURING in San Diego!
@CarolynJung So glad to hear that, Carolyn. He rubbed me the wrong way watching him on several shows. Nice to know it's wrong impression!
@CarolynJung Eric strikes me as incredibly arrogant.  Is that just his "French" accent that is offputting to me?  How was he?
Anyone go to the Parade of Lights in San Diego bay tonight?  I seem to miss that every year.  Dreary, drizzly out there tonight in SD...
The Prize came with bottle of wine, cheese, crackers, wooden cutting board.  Too bad I'm allergic to wine.  Baileys, Kahlua, I'm OK with!
@SDRadio Oh, now wouldn't THAT be sweet!  Ha!  No, the prize was a bottle of BV Cabernet (I'm allergic to wine).  Anyone wanna trade for ?
@cookingwithamy There were two things I came away from Hawaii knowing I'd miss:  Malasadas (#1) and Linguica! OMG they are so good! :)
Just got back from office party.  I won a prize!  Yay! This house was so gorgeous - beautiful hillside home in Poway! What a view!
So they say OPEC will cut production to raise prices? Fine, I think we've shown we can cut down on our driving. See who buckles first! Ha!
@WalkingHorse  Thanks!  It is so frustrating because I really need something off this account.  Grrr!
For those of you who had problems with your GMAIL account, did it get resolved or did you get tech support involved? Now I've got problem!
@thepegisin  My cousin won both showcases at The Price is Right.  Being outgoing really helps!
@sdtips We still have some gaps to fill. Don't worry, I'll call on ya'
@kellypea Well, if they gave out badges now...you would earn one for charity (4 the cookies  you made for soldier's families!)  :)
@passion4eating Do you know the name of the dish that is like grits?
@passion4eating His last name sounds Dutch. Does that help?
@passion4eating He is from an area that is about 100 miles South of Limpopo province (because I told him about Peppadews being grown there)
@gourmeted Use more nuts and maybe a 2nd flavor of chips for different magic bars
Anyone have any good, traditional South African dishes they've made?  New co-worker is from there but he's been gone awhile.
#jetcrash Let's all pray that people thought to be in house that F-18 crashed into were somewhere else. Unconfirmed deaths - sad day
San Diego - one station reported Grandma & 2 children possible fatalities in one of houses at crash site. Unconfirmed & hopefully wrong...
San Diego - Someone in La Jolla Centre Towers could see the flames from plane crash & says they are out now.
@kellypea Baking with primer fumes?  Kelly go BOOM!
@sdtips Caron had that same thing happen on Yelp. someone copied her entire post! That made  me mad & it wasn't even my blog!
@carondg I do! Set some aside for me and I will take off your hands! My son & stepdaughter's gifts will need to be mailed this  year. ..
@kellypea I must say that the Black/White cookies were BE-YOO-TEE-FULL and are going to go on any cookie tray I prepare. Even if not tasty!
@kellypea Oh DUH, I just read your blog.  It must have been the Mocha Toffee bars on your website.  How did they come out? Smelled great!
@kellypea Did I smell coffee or espresso or cappuchino coming from box of cookies you sent? I could smell them from the back seat. Yum!
@Inyourkitchen I can't remember who tweeted the link to the article to Caron but I read all about your date. How awkward but still fun?
@norecipes Love the content on your blog but the font size is too small to be comfortable for my eyes. Getting older sucks...
@Inyourkitchen I wanna be there too!  For observation, of course...since I know NOTHING about smoking...
Drinking Chock Full O Nuts coffee that I "heard" was big on East Coast...Pretty smooth (I'm not normally a coffee drinker...)
You San Diego people need to try the wonderful food at The Venetian in Pt. Loma if you haven't already! YUM! Linguine w/ clams! So GOOD!
Just came from WONDERFUL surprise birthday party that husband pulled off tonite.  Great friends, FABULOUS food prepared by Chef at Venetian!
@inyourkitchen It was great getting to know you better. I predict wonderful things ahead for you.
@carondg thanks again for sharing yummy treats. just what the Dr. ordered... :)
@kellypea You are way too harsh on yourself. these cookies look FABulous!
@kellypea Are you home?  I just sent my Aunt and Uncle on their merry way.  No more doctors until next week (THANK GOD!) LOL!
@thepegisin But tweeters are upbeat!  (For the most part...HA!)
@kikarose Many good thoughts being sent your way for your mother.  Hope all goes well (& that she has good doctors!).
@dietriffic fuggedaboutit til after holidays. Too many holiday traditions rooted in food. Healthy choice LAST thing on my mind.
@thegourmetgirl You got that right! Some (not all) Dr's have HUGE egos...
@kellypea Did you want me to still pick up cookies tomorrow? (4 families of injured soldiers)
Dr was mad that I called him out on making us wait. Said "I'm not discussing this w/ U" jerk!
@lindaeskin Food at Sharp is terrible. THAT I know
Just had to deal with Alec Baldwin type Dr. at Sharp Memorial. frustrating dealing w Dr w/ GOD complex
OK tweeps...tell me...do you think it is acceptable to wait 6 hrs. for Dr. in charge to discharge U?
Newscasts tell me that person who died last night was victim of hit and run in Alpine. Was in lobby when group of friends got news. Sad...
@carondg I am soooo weary.  Back and forth to hospital..cooking for crowd at house...I've never repeated myself as much as in last week
@carondg I'm hoping she will be released Thursday. She is sick of hospital but very weak from blood loss after surgery. 2 transfusions...
@cbsop Sorry to hear that Jerry. Have you tried soft music or a rhythmic noise machine in his room?  It might help...
Someone came out & announced to group that he (Eddie?) had no brain activity & entire room started crying. Man, I felt their pain...
After watching newscast at 10, have surmised that person that had 50 people in waiting room was bicyclist injured in Alpine. Sad...
@carondg Just got back from the hospital.  Exhausted. Eating warmed up dinner (Haloopsi that my husband made for me...)
there must be 50 people waiting on news of their faher? grandfather?
feel sorry for huge contingent of family members who just got word of death. So sad for them.
waiting in hospital lobby for Aunt to come out of surgery.  I have become good at waiting...
@techlifeweb I just had checked on it so I know boat parade is 12/14 & 12/21. I want to see it this year for sure! Years past was 2 busy

@DowntownRob I love the sandwiches at Mimmo's! Yum! And those salads!! Wow!  Gotta get back there soon...
@RecipeGirl  Great Lori!  Thanks, I knew you would!!  :)
@rockstarjen Thanks for telling San Diego people with RT about our holiday project www.ablogaboutfood.wordpress.com
@northlight Thanks STEVE!!!  :)
San Diegans - PLEASE take a minute to read my post about helping families of injured military www.ablogaboutfood.wordpress.com. THANKS!
@GarySoup Yeah, I followed up on that Gary and no proof of insurance is required.  Just Drivers License.  Can I count on you for cookies?
In answer to other question, there are 2 separate "houses" for these families so need cookies/cupcakes/baked goods put on 2 separate plates
They just need to show Drivers License and proof of insurance at gate per Fisher House director.
In answer to some questions I am getting, I need enough cookies to feed 30-35 people.   Even though on military base, civilians can access
We have a lot to be thankful for. Family members of injured soldiers do not.  Will you San Diego Foodies help by making cookies? DM me
What San Diego food bloggers would B on board 2 join in providing platter of cookies to military families staying w/ injured soldier? DM me
DM@recipegirl Thanks Lori!  I appreciate it!

@LindaEskin Traditional tamales used lard.  New version uses solid vegetable shortening.  They aren't good for you but oh, so good!  :)
@LindaEskin Cool, I did not know about the one in PB.  I recommend the beef tamale and the cheese/jalapeno ones.  They are very, very good!
@starkoch The tamales are good from Tamales Ancira in Chula Vista & available year round. They also have a branch in Escondido. Try them!

@WalkingHorse DM me your e-mail address and I'll send you a step-by-step recipe
@WalkingHorse Cook celery & carrots in boiling chicken broth while the breasts are cooling down.Add shredded chicken back in, then dumplings
@iliketocook why did you hate your food class? You can visit my blog & learn some neat stuff & recipes. www.ablogaboutfood.wordpress.com
@thatgirlblogs Maybe you wanted to show your high school friends that you're still HOT? LOL!  I dunno but now you gotta deal w/ it! :)
@WalkingHorse Some people like the dough type dumplings better.  I like both but have always made them this way. I use celery+carrots in 'em
@Adora I can help moderate. Already have moderator duties for cooking.com...what's one more, right?
@WalkingHorse No magical formula. Just use the recipe on side of Bisquick box. The trick is to hold them on boiling stock til they float
The front area where Vons employees smoke their cigs is littered with butts! Am calling the Mgr tomorrow to tell him to make them sweep up!
For dessert, Hubby bought me a Cinnamon Roll from my favorite bakery. Will heat up with a tiny bit of butter on top.  Howzat sound?
My chicken and dumplings were so good tonight.  "Almost" as good as Mom used to make. I think she added parsley or somethin to the biscuits.

Hello to new followers @grammargirl, @mommyslittlemon @gracepiper and @samanthafiles! Are you fans of Mexican food?
If jerk suddenly starts bidding on my item, I will bid price up on e-bay items I know I can buy cheaper on Amazon. Do your homework suckers!
@HappyCowsBlog I love HUH-MY-KA drink! Few restaurants in town make it from scratch so I brew my own too. Refreshing with slice of lime too!
@GrammarGirl I used to win speed contests to diagram sentences but now "Microsoft Word" always gives error "FRAGMENT...Consider revising" Ha
@cupcakeproject Did you see my link to the Noodle Kugel recipe someone gave me on cooking.com? Sounds yummy!
@foodiechick Thanks for the tips. How helpful!!
@eddieross Glad to know you twitter.  Loved the show you did with old earrings and vintage postcards.  They were way cool!
@foodiechick The bottom of my page doesn't have older + numbers...just the word older.  Yours says Older2, Older3, etc.??
Welcome new followers @RobinGrantham, @SallyMcMullin, @barefootplumies, amd @GeorgeSerpa!
I wish @Twitter would let you jump back by page #. It's a PAIN to have to click older&gt;, older&gt; over & over again when I've been out awhile.
@cookingwithamy Yes, eddieross is very talented and collects some of the coolest stuff!
Yay! I already got a response to my request for Tried and True Noodle Kugel recipes and it sounds delicious! http://tinyurl.com/5bkq5a
@carondg Oh, I'm not saying to spend $3.00 a gal just to go THERE. It would have to be part of a whole "LA" food/farmers market" visit.
@sdtips I SOOOO want to go to Phillipes!  I've always believed that simple, basic menus have the most chance for success. Sounds great!
@carondg I would be up for a trip to LA and to Phillippes sometime (before I go back into the workforce).  Website is lovely!
@cbsop Great title!  Or..."Just can't find the words" Or "Words escape him"  I think this is a very needed blog...you'll see
@DineandDish Looks delish and cinnamony.  (Source of recipe??) But hey, shouldn't you be working on that deadline?? Just kidding!  :)
@carondg Works for me! I can go to your place and we can head over there all together if you want??? Let me know!
@carondg Listening to more shows now. We can go Mon or Tues of next week? Am going to No. County Thurs & might go out of town this weekend.
@kellypea Well, it is a close call.  @steamykitchen has a closeup on her pix that makes her easy to spot on the "wall" too. But you win, OK?
@carondg I am definitely visiting the Burger Lounge after hearing your broadcast! My mouth was watering listening to their descriptions...
@chrishansen Keeping my fingers crossed that you're getting "both" sides of story. Homeowners greed contributed to mess, too. Trust me...
@cbsop Thanks Jerry!
@carondg And finally "SUB-mission" Valley...where all the SUB-Prime loans were originated..
@carondg ROFL!  Yes, that's it!  De-Commission!
@GrammarGirl I would've hated to be the proofreader and 2nd set of eyes for your book.  Talk about pressure!!! Yikes!
@GrammarGirl Congrats! After being married for 12 yrs to guy who uses "went" instead of "gone", I think my grammar is getting worse. Doh!
We used to call Mission Valley "Com-mission Valley" because of all the mortgage companies there. I guess they're called "Oh-mission" now...
@napafarmhouse,@Thursday4Dinner Welcome! Looking forward to sharing! Do you have a favorite type ethnic food?
@TheCrabPlace Hi fellow foodie! My son's girlfriend (fiance'?) is from Maryland and swears I would love the crabs.Wait...doesn't sound right
Yeah, right!
That's what I guess I've been my whole life.  An "etc." - not able to be defined.  BUT now I'm a foodie...I belong...I'm somebody now!! ;)
@rachelsklar Do you think McCain made the choice or was it made for him?  Huh?  I think the latter...
@sdtips Funnneeee....  Bwahaha!
Hoping that by Nov 6 at tweetup, you "mysterious" tweeple will finally let us know your first name. Kind of hard to use your nom de plume...
Do you find yourself "speaking" in more concise, succinct sentences since using Twitter? I can say so much more in so few letters now.  Ha!
Just got back from having fish tacos with friends at Hooleys. How many of you non-Californians have ever tried this SoCal treat?
I had absolutely NO idea there were as many Twitter tools as this post by Brian Solis showed me.  WOW! http://tinyurl.com/6mv5un
@coconutlime Can I have some of your extras!  LOL! :)  Just kidding!
@coconutlime You do your posts ahead of time & SCHEDULE them. Gawd, I'm such a loser! Maybe I'm not cut out to have a food blog!
@cupcakeproject You're right, I did...but I'm so shallow!  Now I'm turning to google to find out what a noodle kugel is. Must be GOOD!
@taterloyyd, @kalynskitchen, @DineandDish, @san_dyego, @JT-C Welcome! Happy that you're along for the ride! :)
@andreasrecipes, @foodloverlikeme, @heatherb84, @StickyGooeyChef, @Whisk_food_blog, @cupcakeproject - Welcome new followers! Favorite food?
@JT_C Wow! Adults in PJs can eat all the pancakes they want at The Waterfront each Sat from 6am - 2pm. Haven't tried them but it's tempting!
@carondg Nov. 6 works for Tweetup for me. Didn't see this post yesterday...Oops!
http://flockup.com/flocks/doglovers Created a flock for all us "crazy about our dogs" doglovers. Woof!
@DineandDish Don't beat yourself up. It's like a late birthday card. DO IT NOW ~ & just think, it will be the only ones they get toDAY! Ha!
Welcome new Tweeples @david_ogilvy, @plangarden, @inyourkitchen, @manderin21 and prior followers! Looking forward to sharing...
Finally watched SNL tape from last Sat. Best thing about show was discovering Adele. Love "Chasing Pavements". What a voice!
@carondg I hope they have the yellow peppadews.  If they don't, let me know and I'll get you some this week.  Definitely going back fir more
@carondg Where are you headed for Sushi?  Sushi Itto?
Wow, found a recipe that will use my chicken, peppadews & lemon thyme from my garden. Score! http://tinyurl.com/5bfrde Herb crusted breasts!
@zoebakes I'm not kidding...it was soooo good.  Bagel was toasted just right...onions...capers...great lox...jeez, who thought of it first?
Bought some Air-Cooled chicken breasts from Whole Foods last night and prolly going to stuff them with some spinach/cheese combo. Any ideas?
Lemon Ricotta cookies http://tinyurl.com/62r9ct from Recipe Girl sound like a winner. I think I have more ideas than I have lemons. Yikes!
@carondg They were in the middle section where they have the goat cheese topped with fig/walnut compote, near the salad bar. They R sweeter
Searching for recipes from my cooking.com compadres to use my Meyer Lemons. Link to Asparagus & Lemon Risotto is winning so far.  Ideas?
@carondg So good by themselves that it's hard not to just pop them in my mouth & eat plain! Gawd they're good!! Bought the gold ones too!
Thought that having lox & bagel yesterday would satisfy that craving but no, I think I need to do that again real soon. It was sooooo good!
Had delicious sushi at Ichiban in Hillcrest last nite with DH. He'd never been there before & gave rave reviews. Friendly staff too!
I bought some peppadews at Whole Foods last night (thanks Carondg for getting me addicted). Now to decide how best to hilite their flavor...
@PinchMySalt Who the flock thought of this great idea! LOL!  Great!  I love SD food bloggers!!
@zoebakes Congrats!  Your book is on my list to buy when I get extra money in my (unemployed) budget!  For sure!!!
@carondg We went there (on your rec) right before it closed. Got some salumi too! Which type did you get?
@PinchMySalt and @carondg The empanadas recipe is up on the blog now.  These can also be made with a machaca (shredded beef) filling.
@carondg Yes I will be posting it today for everyone (all 3 of my readers!). See you in a little while...
@aliceqfoodie Geez, what time do they close? And wouldn't it be nice to grab something like that to eat late nite in San Diego? Oh yeah...
@trikki427 I added your blog to my blogroll.  I'm just starting out. You have a great site!
@jbruin That's one of my favs! Love the fried zucchini, too. I always feel like I should be wearing Marilyn Monroe outfit to eat there...
So the union that Joe the plumber "should" belong to says they back Obama? http://tinyurl.com/49w28u
@whatscooking Never heard of Tinga. Interesting! These are my savory empanadas.  I make my sweet (apricot) ones with a cream cheese pastry.
So now we're getting more "facts" about Joe the "supposed" plumber. Not a good biz risk 4 banks if you OWE taxes!  http://tinyurl.com/4uznjn
www.ablogaboutfood.wordpress.com has my post about Empanadas. Any fans out there of these tempting delights?
@asterapallas Last week I saw the LV sign being worked on. Whatever they do, I hope they make a safe way for people to park & take pix.
Gotta go frost my cake for the cake decorating class tonight. Decorating a cookie monster cake. Would he be upset about "Mother's" demise?
Getting about 2 to 3 followers a day to unsavory sites. Sounds like other tweeps are getting em too. Wish I knew where they found us..
@trikki427 If Kellypea follows you, then I'm sure I'm gonna like following you as well...Looking forward to your posts!  :)
I broke my decades old thermometer last night. Too hard a flick to get mercury down. Have you ever tried to pick up mercury?Slippery buggers
@PinchMySalt They were prolly the French pumpkins that Martha Stewart put on her Fall cover, eh? Otherwise, are they CRAZY??
Recovering from fever and chills last night, all night... Hope it is just a 24 hr bug. Feeling like head will explode.  Bleh!
Aww, now I can't hear this "Hey There Delilah" song without thinking about Sarah Palin? Damn! http://tinyurl.com/3lj6so
@BestFoodBlogEVR Are you going to share some of this knowledge with the rest of the class?  Hmm? Are ya?
Eating late tonight - dinner is still simmering. Chicken Cacciatore, one of my favorites! It will be even better tomorrow! :)
@foodiechick My fav's were always the Choc Chip, the ones that were in the assorted pack, very shortbread-like. Haven't seen those in awhile
Just got back from dropping off donations at nuns from Mother Teresa's order. They live so humbly and are so grateful. So selfless & kind...
I found plenty of Mother's cookies at the commissary.  Are they getting scarce out there already? Told my friends to buy their Oatmeal Iced!
@zoebakes I never meet anyone who calls it 10x sugar anymore!  Guess I'm a member of the "older" generation based on the puzzled looks I get
@zoebakes Kind of the reverse of what the Chinese have been doing, eh?  LOL!
Off to catch a few estate sales on their last day. That's when you get the best bargains. Just put my Quaker Lace tablecloth ($10 find!) out
@ChefMark Upload it on YouTube and let us see it.  I'm sure it's adorable.  My pooch does that all the time!  LOL!
@foodiechick Thanks foodiechick!  Just don't look at mine and then pop over to Kellypea's or Caron's or AliceQ.  I pale in comparison!
My new blog is www.ablogaboutfood.wordpress.com  Sorry, I thought you saw the URL when you clicked on my profile, but not everyone does eh?
OK, twits...I finally started my own blog. Lots to learn. Still figuring stuff out.  Go easy on me with the criticism, OK?
Gonna make a trek down to my fav Mexican restaurant for Tacos topped with Cotija cheese and Chorizo con Huevos! Mouth is watering now...
@ChefJoAnna Oh, BTW, they think all Californian's are kooky. Um, yeah, we place 48th nationally in test scores...NOT! That would be YOU! ha!
@ChefJoAnna At least you can understand 'em. When I first moved to KY back in '79, I was thinking I'd moved to another country!
@aliceqfoodie Congrats on being listed on Martha Stewart's Blog Inner Circle.  Whoo Hoo!  You deserve it!
@aliceqfoodie I'm in and it'll be easy for me to remember...kinda like Taco Tuesdays is stuck in my brain.  LOL!
@chrishansen I got sick of borrwrs insisting on buying home $50k more than I qualified them for. They counted on value going up, up, up
@chrishansen You have 2 remember that there are 2 sides to story. Incredibly greedy consumers wanted low pymts to fund their TOYS & big cars
Gonna try to hit a few estate sales this AM. Always on the lookout for some cool antique kitchen gadget. It's an addiction.
@aliceqfoodie I think something weird is happening to your posts. Some seem to be there, then gone. Hmm...never saw your reply to Chow Ques?
@cbsop Nah, our commissary is brand new-no old stock. The main raise in price has been corn related products (corn oil, fresh corn, etc.)
@carondg Okey dokey. I'll send you a DM with my contact info.  You're the one with the busy schedule & I can be available to accommodate it.
@kellypea You need someplace to hide out from the process server? If not...We'll come visit you in the slammer Kelly. JK
@carondg Just read that it is the largest in the WORLD! http://tinyurl.com/3o4e5j  It would be good 4 you to see inside at least once!
@carondg I think you would like 32nd street most. Boar's Head Meats, HUGE produce section, Anthony's Seafood, & sometimes cooking demos.
@carondg There are 3 that are pretty close. 32nd Street is largest in nation I think, then Miramar, and Coronado is smaller. Pendleton too.
Hey Tweets, any of you stay up all night and watched the sun rise lately? It was so much easier in my twenties!
@everydayfooddeb Steak ranchero (thin-sliced sirloin in red sauce with onions & peppers) with beans & rice can be done for under $10.
@chrishansen When will this story air?  Did I miss it?
@kellypea Love this new pic! Smiley face! Thank you for your wit & always making ME smile!  Luv ya!
Wish I could remember whose website had some yummy picture of what looked like breaded zucchini! Tweets, which of  you had a blog with that?
@aliceqfoodie Yeah, you got dropped somehow.  That's why I had to DM you instead of @ message...Wonder what happened?
Ground cloves at the commissary were $1.89 compared to $8.00 at civilian store. Same brand. What's wrong with this picture?
@anitachu Say it ain't so! So many long-time standbys...gone. Must go to store TOday & snatch up last bag of pink animal cookies.  Waahh!
@everydayfooddeb Finally got chance to watch Wed. DVR'd show.  You didn't seem nervous at all. Martha was rushed. Nice earrings & GOOD JOB!
Hoping that cake I frosted for decorating class tonite doesn't melt & hoping finished product doesn't end up here http://tinyurl.com/69s9nv
Enough is enough! Had to give my chilies an emergency dose of water to keep them from wilting on the vine. C'mon fall already, cheesh!
I'd forgotten how delicious a tuna salad sandwich on toasted sourdough was! The jalapeno slices  in escabeche was the perfect accent! Try it
@zoebakes I believe in using testers. I helped on a Junior League book & now I trust the recipes in their books over others. It works!
@RecipeMatcher Parboil potatoes in their jackets,let cool before shredding or dicing & small amount of finely diced onion at the end. Yum!
After watching 20 minutes of taped debate, husband looks at me and says "Allright, who else is running for Prez?" Ross Perot ran too soon!
I'm 72 minutes in to the Biden-Palin debate that I DVR'd. Does Palin really think that winking and saying "You Betcha" are gonna sway me?
@inncuisine I've been happy with my Centro phone. Keys are tiny so might be a problem if you have Fat Fingers!  Hah! Just teasin'
@kellypea That's terrible...How'd you find it?  Dirtbags!
Winding down 3 days in Vegas. Seems slower all around. Traffic on the strip still maddening. Everyone mumbling that they are losing. Sad!
@ChefMark Geez Mark, when do you sleep?  Are you an insomniac like Martha Stewart? S'OK...just wonderin'
@everydayfooddeb Tell him the middle child is always the overacheiver...he will be the envy of his siblings someday. Just sayin'
@carondg Congrats to your parents! Mine celebrated 55 years on 10/3. They dated for 7 yrs before that! (8 per Mom!) Dinner planned 4 Monday!
@everydayfooddeb Curious to know how you decide whom to follow on Twitter. Doncha just love the timeliness of topics on here?
Hubby got up early this AM to make a Dunkin Donuts run for us. We don't have them in San Diego, which, come to think of it, is prolly good!
@cookingfriend Your bio says www.COKINGfriend...A typo I'm sure...LOL!
Arggh! My Mom will probably vote for McCain/Palin cuz she's "scared" of Obama! Scared of what? What scares me is thinkin Palin could b Prez!
@jbruin Hey...don't laugh. That kind of dancing is FUN!  And it is how I met my unbelievably compatible mate! More down-to-earth than usual!
Packing for Bikefest in Vegas. 4 days in desert heat but it is even hotter in vendor booths with scantily clad models. Such a hard job.
Raiders fired head coach 4 games into (second) losing season. Who can work for that crazy man anyway? Still...glad we beat 'em last Sunday!
@chrishansen Nice piece on the soldier.  Am just left wondering what happened to witnesses who initially lied? What is their story?
How mortifying to be the chef that made Mario Batali sick on his first episode of "Spain, on the road again" KPBS. Raw partridge was served.
@everydayfooddeb Your family is going to confiscate your "Crackberry"!  Hope you are enjoying your day "off"!  LOL!

@everydayfooddeb You get prize as my most active twitterer.  Fun to read your updates. I know if you work for MS Co., you are busy bee! ;)
@everydayfooddeb Yes, when bacon is used in cooking contests, it invariably wins. These are covered in thick, teriyaki type sauce & so easy
@everydayfooddeb I'm new to you, too Deb so I'll tell you that the biggest hit of all time that I bring is bacon-wrapped water chestnuts.
@everydayfooddeb We cook with best friends, go to movies at Navy base (free), split big quantities (and cost) with friends to save money
Wouldn't it be nice if at the end of our lives we could look back on our journey with satisfaction like Paul Newman?  RIP - you were unique!
Downloading tunes 2 iPod. Love Joshua Radin's "Today" song Heard first on "Ellen". I'm such an incurable romantic. Luckily my guy is too...
@foodiechick Someone JUST told me about that place.  Combo butcher shop & steakhouse puzzled me as to how it is set up.  Thanks for rec!!
@chrishansen How incredibly rewarding it must have been to see the transformation of those Cambodian girls. You made a big difference. Bravo
@carondg What were some of the steakhouse recs?  We will probably try either Flemings or Donavan's this coming week.  Any ideas?
@everydayfooddeb I'm interested in new Bar Cookie recipes as well as new uses for different kinds of squash & latest & greatest antioxidants
@kellypea Have you always had the pix of Zucchini Flowers on header?  I JUST took pix of my end of summer blooms yesterday. Coinkeedink...
So the debate is back on?  I hope Obama brings up the press corps lack of accessibility to Sarah Palin.
Just reviewing my latest Everyday Food Mag. Lot of temptations! LOVE the brown cakestand!  Another "Good Job" to EDFDeb and EDFSandy.
After baking this afternoon, too pooped to cook.  Gonna make BLT's but I'm going to bake the Bacon, rather than frying it. Flatter bacon...
Making yeast bread braid with apricot jam filling to take to my friend's neighbor - offering of sympathy on husband's passing. So sad...
Might have to break down and re-subscribe to HBO.  Saw True Blood at friend's house.  Definitely not your run-of-the-mill storyline...
@jbruin Geez, does that just make you start thinking "What if?"  Glad you weren't hurt.
In 13 minutes, the living room will be quiet and I can finally start reading &quot;Eat, Pray, Love&quot;

Finally reached gate to park & see Chargers beat the Jets
Trying to wrap up bill-paying so I can spend an hour or so watching a little of first season of "Mad Men" bought at Target.  I'm hooked!
