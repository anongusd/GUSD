@lyn_cade I don't like it but it's a do you want a Democrat who's going to vote with you 50% of the time or a Republican that's going to vote with you 0% of the time.
@lyn_cade Fair. I don't want her to run for prez. As for her voting record, in certain states and districts, you're going to have to vote in certain ways to win. That voting record of hers helped her win that seat. She won 17% of the Republican vote which is impressive in a state like AZ.
@lyn_cade To be fair, she ran in Arizona which is a Republican state. It was a wise decision to distance herself from HRC  and Michelle. Overall, she ran a smart campaign.
