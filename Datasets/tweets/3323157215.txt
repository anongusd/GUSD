@realDonaldTrump Scared

@KamalaHarris I am looking forward to your announcement when you run for president
@keithboykin Close enough
@tomhanks 20% off, what a deal!
@BradMossEsq That's what they said about Trump
@kylegriffin1 I want all the Democrats to announce and let's get this started. I mean Democrats no Bernie

@terrence_mccoy @GlennKesslerWP I pay $10 per month to read the Washington Post online, a great deal for all the great articles
@kylegriffin1 @PressHerald LaPage was only elected because a third-party split the Democratic vote. Many things will be better when Mills takes office. We also have rank choice voting, not this time for governor, but other states should look into it.

@shaunking Bots are pushing against Beto as well, who does that benefit? Trump and other Republicans want division
@PressHerald Kitty say Merry Christmas https://t.co/iWfz36VjiW
@McFaul @realDonaldTrump He will make sure the rest of us won't have a Merry Christmas either
@costareports Sanders allies, Trump and bots.
@SenBobCorker @Zac_Petkanas I'm glad you're saying this but until other Republicans stop being afraid of Trump tweeting against them he will keep doing it and nothing will change.
@realDonaldTrump @SenatorCollins Is this why you won't stand up to Trump because your afraid he will tweet something like this about you? @CollinsWatch
@AmbassadorRice I hope you'll come here to Maine in the new year and explore running against Susan Collins
@lesleyabravanel When I was a kid the teacher's said we'd be safe under our desks
@guardian The trolls are out against Beto

@anneapplebaum @carolecadwalla
@ScottMStedman In 2008 at my Democratic caucus people brought food, everyone friendly no matter if you voted for Obama or Hillary. In 2016 the Sanders supporters were vicious against Hillary &amp; really pushed the rest of us supporting her. They were pressing the fake Russia stories.
@SenatorCollins Your turn to retire
@Tom_Winter I bet this was part of those Redacted items in that Flynn report
@alroker I'd pass on the kale and use spinach, but still looks good
@jaketapper As a Mainer, I will never vote for her again and there are many more people here who feel the same way.

@chelliepingree Hopefully his and @RoyMooresHorse have new homes
@Amy_Siskind I would like to see them all announce, let them go out and tell us what they stand for. This back bitting at this stage is what the Republicans want.
@andylassner Trump is still scared about what Flynn knows, still defends him. Remember he fired Comey because he wouldn't back off Flynn's investigation.
@ScottMStedman Sounds like she's not denying the story
@hsu_spencer As long as it is not made public when she is moved, what is the problem? We know she is cooperating

@barbaraemiller @andylassner @FoxNews @foxandfriends This has made me extra mad today, Trump controlling the news and the media falling for it, I wish they would just say these are lies then move on to what's happening in court and the border
@chucktodd He's controlling the news today to distract from Manafort and Cohen in court. Stop falling for it, say he's lying and move on to the real stories.
@SRuhle @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Please in your next show say these statements are lies then go on to Manafort, Cohen in court, he plays the media every day to what he wants to see, don't keep doing it.
@andylassner @FoxNews @foxandfriends It's all a smoke screen to distract from Paul Manafort going to jail and Michael Cohen heading to court all happening today.
@realDonaldTrump Why don't you just pardon yourself, you said you can do it
@andylassner A new inditment would as well
@realDonaldTrump Between being sued for your fake charity and Michael Cohen flipping on you, when you're out of office you will never get a warm welcome in New York or any place else

@SteveKornacki That's not nice, I like watching you
@kylegriffin1 No wonder Trump went on that tweet rant the same day about Sessions &amp; FBI. Flynn, Stone, Kushner, Page &amp; Jr must of been shaking today
@StephenKing The pressure is on even more after Mannaforts raid, his tweet storm that same day against FBI &amp; Sessions, I'm even more afraid about N Korea
@PreetBharara Seeing Trump's tweets that day explains alot, especially going after Sessions and FBI.
@StephenKing Craziest on the planet? That is the one thing Trump is winning at
