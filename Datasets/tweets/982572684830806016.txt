@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Mr President,  please do not sign this bill. This bill is attempt to hamstring your administration and the safety of the American people , there are so many land mines in this bill. I know to shutdown the government will difficult, this is frustrating to watch. Thank you.

@RealJamesWoods Here's the problem, when I served in the military you respected the rank of the officer even if you didn't like the person. These people are disrespectful to the President of the United States of America, duly elected by the people. When he says stop you stop , period!
@applemachome @RParker0313 @ShannonBream Absolutely, along with parent involvement at all levels.
@RealJamesWoods Looking good, love your work. Got anything in the works as far as a movie.?
@applemachome @RParker0313 @ShannonBream Good point, but without a honest assessment on one's abilities how do you determine where there strengths and weaknesses are. You could very easley miss ones disabilities . It's also a good measure of the staff and the teaching modalities used, and some anxiety is not always bad.
@applemachome @RParker0313 @ShannonBream I guess you don't have a job, because it does relate to the real world.. when you leave school and enter the work force you performance is always graded. If everyone gets the same review how can you determine promotions and raises?
@w_terrence I agree I wouldn't put it past some left wing nut to send the bombs. They didn't explode did they! To make them victims.
@realDonaldTrump We must stop them, anuff is anuff. When I was working and and was renting a home , I had to pay for a background and credit check to accomplish  both. how do these people get work and a place to live. This is a disgrace.
@realDonaldTrump please send the military to the border Mr. PRESIDENT.  These people are lawless, they pushed right past the Mexican police.
I watched the news reports of this so called caravan approaching our border and correct me if I'm wrong,  I see that most seem to be healthy young men able to walk hundreds of miles. Why aren't they in there country trying to make a difference. Like our proud vets have done here?
@RealJamesWoods Mr. Woods can some please explain to me when I look at news reports of this so called caravan that's coming to our border I can't help but notice that most seem to be healthy  young men. Why aren't they staying in there country to fight and make Changes there?
@realDonaldTrump Close the border anyway only let commerce through in till we can stop this rush on the border.
@ELafland @karlazabs But they will stay I Mexico!

@TheFive Had to turn the channel,  that has bin Haraldo must go , don't bring him back
The Democrats used a survivor of sexual assault for there own purposes.  To delay any President Trumps agenda. They are the deplorables.
Time for you to retire.
@PPact @surfcityphoto Screw yoi
They say woman will be fired up for the midterms, yes they will. But not for the Democrat party. The jest showed they will use woman for ther own means and the throw them under the bus.
@realDonaldTrump Yes

I can't take this, this is embarrassing,  the Democrat senators can speak to her while the Republicans have to write notes. What the hell is wrong with these people?

The dead line to respond for Dr Ford is this morning if she will share her side of the story on Monday. If she does not agree, the SENATORS must act and move forward. They must restore confidence of there supporters and the American people and the constitutional process.

@ABC In this case a warrant for MURDER.
@ABC Why does someone drive a car without an id? How was he going to get on to the maternity ward without an id ?  because he didn't want anyone to know who he was. You see all to often people who who have no I'd on them are probably hiding something.
@ABC Ok, so it was a secluded c section, not an emergency. Not giving birth on the spot. Don't see the out rage.

@greggutfeld Can't understand why they preempted your show on Sunday afternoon,  I'm a big fan of fox news and your show but come on they hung around like ambulances chasers wating for something to happen. Not a banner moment for fox.
