@stephiegal Oui saw this one at Mus√©e Marmottan Monet in Paris!
@jellen805 Nope.
@jellen805 The rumor is it was caused by high voltage sparking at PG&amp;E's Poe Powerhouse on the Feather River.  Not sure if it's true.  PG&amp;E is our best client and now they are facing potential bankruptcy over this and other fires.
@jellen805 Yeah the Camp Fire is absolutely horrifying.  Many, many deaths and 10,000 structures lost.  The town of Paradise is wiped out.  We are renting a surplus house to some good friends who lost theirs in Paradise.
@jellen805 Well perhaps your counter is easy to clean.  Oil spatter all over the patio slab is not.  I decided not to fry this year because we are finally getting a big rain storm here in NorCal that has been burning since July. The Trumpster is flying in today to review the carnage.
@jellen805 Also be aware that even with a lid the oil spatters all over the place so you may want to put down something (non-flammable) under the fryer to keep your concrete clean.  I use a big plastic tray that you put under the washing machine to catch overflows.

@stephiegal The Met is really the place to go in NYC.  We actually became members (special entrance + no lines) and visited 4 times in our one week trip.  Totally worth it. Great art and the rooftop wine garden is sublime!
@stephiegal since you are an art nerd like me, you really should get to the MoMA.  It has some great stuff and sadly several rooms of total crap.  The Wyeth painting is in a really odd location though in a hallway by a set of stairs.  I'm not sure if it was a temporary spot or not.

@jellen805 Dean Cain and Gillian Turner. Dean was really funny and interacted with me on Twitter after the show.  Gillian got in a spat with Tyrus. Greg barked at everyone for not being prepared for a segment. Kat was on her phone every break then stuffed it under her butt as taping started
@jellen805 I can't remember but I'm going to guess it was 50 to 70 people. Pretty small but very loud group.  The producer got us warmed up and we practiced cheering, clapping, and booing then we did these things during the show when prompted.  It was hilarious!
@jellen805 @TheFive @PlanetTyrus It's fun but you need to book tix waaaay out in advance.  I think we were on a waiting list for a couple months then got word we could get the tickets but had 1 day to decide.  The people working the show were really nice and they fed us dinner.
@jellen805 here is waiting for the show to start. https://t.co/8E4rhrsLPx
@jellen805 @TheFive @PlanetTyrus The taping was really just like a live show where they took breaks that were timed like regular commercial breaks so it only took an hour. The total experience (a lot of waiting beforehand) took probably 3 hours.

@katnandu Fraudulent claims of minority status...
@SharylAttkisson Occum's razor
Just spit-balling here but I'm guessing the Dems will try to delay and run out the clock until after the election as their only means of stopping Trump's appointment
Have the grassroot lefties busted out the fill-in-the-blank preprinted protest signs yet?

@jordanbpeterson ...obdurate....   I love that word!
@SalsaPrice Some these things are not like the others....
@jellen805 Also, the Clinton grift has always been that they are running for some powerful position so get your pre-paid contributions (bribes) in now and you will be rewarded with access, contracts, etc. later.
How about we just give Gorsuch 2 votes instead of picking a new justice??
@MartinisBasebal @MLBJesus @SFGiants You prayers are being answered....

I am too sleepy to stay up for the fireworks...
@redsteeze Have a family member there...
@guypbenson Yeah a few years ago we flew from St. Barts to California on the 4th and had fireworks displays out the window all the way across the country.  Pretty cool.
@FalconTurning @RennaW I don't know. Killing your family for quick ribs seems a bit harsh Delwin...
@RennaW Prolly Ok but when we cook faster and hotter they tend to be tougher and stringy. We could cut our ribs last night with a fork
@RennaW We cooked ours last night for 4 1/2 hours and they were spectacular!
@LibertyLynx So you're saying I need to quit man-scaping now?

@LibertyLynx Can't get over the "low energy Jeb" insult probably...
@jellen805 It's a coordinated messaging op √† la journolist. Gives the media something to focus on rather than the IG report.
@EWErickson This reeks of Journolist message coordination.
@cmdeb &lt;you agents of the patriarchy&gt;

So where is Weiner's laptop now and did the FBI actually ever examine the emails looking for evidence of criminal acts? Or did they have it bleach-bitted as well?
@jaketapper @simarilian "mistakes"
I believe @Comey likes to deploy strategic ignorance as a means of self protection when getting questions he doesn't want to answer truthfully.
@AnnaDsays Naughty word marketing play!
@shelbyfero The one to 3 state split is just attempt to garner 4 more Dem Senators, nothing else.  It solves nothing.
@jones4440 @kebejay Perhaps we will see.  The north state has broad support for the State of Jefferson which would be north of Sacramento and SF and would certainly be conservative which is why the Assembly/Senate would never allow it on the ballot.
@joesbooksthings I have about 100 of them (from my dad's youth) very good to poor shape.
@joesbooksthings do you buy/sell biglittle books from the 1930's?
@jones4440 @kebejay I think it would be overwhelmed by urban, coastal populations like San Diego.
@kebejay The one to 3 state split is just attempt to garner 4 more Dem Senators, nothing else.  It solves nothing.
@katelynveronica You need to get in to the optometrist....
@stephiegal Actually the way they are breaking up the state will result in democrat dominance in three states rather than one. What we want is the State of Jefferson.

@sirensoIiIoquy Fiscal policy?
Based on stuff I'm reading (h/t @_ImperatorRex_ )my theory is G. Papadopoulos was inserted into the Trump campaign to associate and collude in order to give Obama probable cause to surveil Trump.They arrested him to keep him from being questioned by the white hats.Prove me wrong!
@_ImperatorRex_ So did they charge G. Pop in order to put him out of reach of others who may have some questions for him?  Makes sense to me...

@KurtSchlichter @bethanyshondark Other than a beyond lame charge of campaign finance violation (which is universal), what, exactly was the law that he broke?
@bethanyshondark Does it rhyme with Sethany?
@DendyEngelman @ElizabethArden Also, make sure you get to Orega, Le Tamerin, Eddies, and Bonito for dinner.  Lunch at Santa Fe and dive bar burgers at Le Select.  Hike to Colombier beach and Washing machine/natural pools.

@Coast__Coast Didn't Comey absolve Clinton for the Marc Rich pardon??
Comey's trick for not answering tough questions is to say "I don't know the answer to that..." as if that is an excuse for his failures.
@jaketapper @Comey Jake why are you spreading fake news? The leaker was Richard Armitage.
@BuckSexton @jaketapper @oliverdarcy @Comey Wow! I thought Jake was better than this.

The young Mr. Hogg is not really interested in dialog or debate.  He is simply trying to burnish his extremist cred with the SJW powerbrokers and $ men (Soros). He wants to be a professional activist like Deray, Shaun King, Rachel Dolezal, etc.
@joannagaines My wife just said that! I said I dunno...
@jellen805 One more thing...take a spa day at the Indian Springs Resort in Calistoga and swim in their gigantic pool heated by a geyser.  We love that place!
@jellen805 Also IMHO:	Schramsburg for bubbly (and really cool because it's in a cave)	Tamber Bey	Stirling...not my favorite wine but a fun ride up the cable car and 360 view from the top!	Chateau Montelena (see the movie Bottle shock for fun first)
@jellen805 Try Davis Estates up the Siverado Trail (tasting w/ food pairing).  It's amaze-balls and the view is sublime! Must have an appointment.

I stand by my conspiracy theory! https://t.co/xgXgRIwjCw
@davealvord164 @drawandstrike @SaraCarterDC "journalist" Cody Shearer was the dude who was dispatched to intimidate @kathleenwilley into silence about Bill's sexual assault. He is a hired thug!
OK so my theory is that Carter Page is and always was part of the FBI/DOJ/Clinton team.  He joined the Trump campaign in order to give them a pretext to spy on the campaign. His protestations are insincere.  Am I wrong? Come @ me Bro!
All Page had to do was get on to the Trump campaign email list and the FBI could spy on all of them.  Does this make sense @drawandstrike ?
I wonder how much they paid Steele to give legitimacy and leak the Clinton-produced dossier?
@drawandstrike @davealvord164 Was he a fall guy or a willing mole?
@katnandu @DevinNunes Maybe Page infiltrated the Trump campaign at the behest of the top FBI/DOJ/Clinton cabal?  And now he is feigning outrage over his treatment? This doesn't add up....
@RobProvince @JesseKellyDC They still can't figure out why Trump won....
@katnandu @DevinNunes Was he actually a mole?
@Uncle_Jimbo Then why did he attack @TuckerCarlson calling him an agent of Putin?
@drawandstrike Is this real???
@jennyleesac30 Yep except that we have to live in California...
@Imperator_Rex3 Wasn't "Clinton Associate" Cody Shearer then same guy who was dispatched to intimidate @kathleenwilley to try to silence her? Sounds more like a thug for hire to me.

@Conrguy @SharylAttkisson Yes the 2nd and 3rd hops going back in time are, in my mind, the big deal in this whole story. A carte blanche pass to spy in the present and the past.
@SharylAttkisson It seems to me that the Carter Page surveillance is not such a huge deal in the grand scheme of things.But what else did his surveillance include? I'm hearing that means all those he had contact with as well as all those who had contact with those contacts.Entire team Trump then?

@v8aholic @HA11NNH But where shall my coffee cup go??
@v8aholic @HA11NNH But does it have decent cup holders? Inquiring minds need to know!
Mr. Obvious says "Mueller will threaten Manafort, etc with major prison time unless he sings anything that could implicate Trump in any way"
I'm thinking of wearing a scary costume for Halloween this year.  Where can I find a Harvey Weinstein mask Twitter??
Last year's Halloween costume is still apropos, eh? Maybe I should add a McDonald's cashier hat? https://t.co/fCLcvofZNw
@HA11NNH What is that??
YES!

@sirensoIiIoquy She's woke white so it's cool racist!
@Opheliaa_1 Yeah they call it "walker"
@ABC7 @Rockprincess818 This is contrived to give the Californias 6 democratic senators instead of 2.
@ChrisMurphyCT Hey @ChrisMurphyCT you and your woke 9 year old are getting owned. Maybe you should sit down.
@molratty @jamiestorment21 Teabagger!
@continetti Please tell us now which candidates you didn't bother to buy oppo-intel on?
@seanmdav Jeb!
@seanmdav EXACTLY!
So did the Washington Free Beacon pay to get oppo-intell on Jeb! ?
Casting call for Harvy Weinstein? https://t.co/pPnScxicYU
Just checked the mail and received a unexpected check for $3000! WINNING!!
Freaking exactly! All the government bureaucrats I know retire 10 years younger with much better benes than us private sector "normals"! https://t.co/t7H9b5tmfN
So Hillary/DNC "helped" pay for the dossier......this is the most unsurprising thing the the history of unsurprising things.Who else helped?
@VICE @edwinajune Look at all the Democrats!
@AsheSchow "helped"....Who else "helped"?? The FBI??
@GillianHTurner @KatiePavlich "helped". who else "helped"...the FBI?
Alinsky rule 4!  Perfect! https://t.co/yA5Z0hSNVM
I'm guessing the Mueller investigation of Podesta is to grant all the Dems immunity to protect them(like Comey) then go after Manafort/Trump

@IamYanetGarcia Central Park NYC?
@sirensoIiIoquy Great googly moogly!
@molratty Nope. Ramble on.
@jannyfayray That would be former Fox News anchor Jane Skinner........Odd indeed.
@stephiegal @jellen805 Springtime. Pierre-Auguste Cot at the Met. https://t.co/En5qYTIHKi
@jellen805 @stephiegal Reminds me of this one. https://t.co/4gy1GWL70z
My thought exactly.... https://t.co/qsGPIsNt9V
@JesseKellyDC What an insult to your character!
@SteveSGoddard That's because he made the decision THEN took the bribe. Wink wink.
@AsheSchow @rosemcgowan I would ask Anita Dunn at SKDKnickerbocker who was running the PR battle for HW.  Either that or big Ben's flacks called @jack for help.
@Tiffany1985B @jennyleesac30 Big blue eyes?
This is actually a huuuuuge part of the problem IMHO. https://t.co/YpTCyvOqOL
@ambiej Why did he accept the money?????
@corrcomm @JammieWF Cultural Marxism strikes again. They never rest.

@weaselzippers Do they give massages there?
@PolitixGal And Hollywood!
@noahsmom7 *thing*.   It's early.
@aggierican Did that once by accident.  Big mistake.  He was just released for murdering a cop!
@noahsmom7 I don't think commitment is his think you know!
@KennedyNation you are one of our faves on Fox!
@RichardNixon103 @EdDriscoll "Goop"
RT @JBrunemeier: I think I now know how Gwyneth Paltrow came up with the name "Goop"!
I think I now know how Gwyneth Paltrow came up with the name "Goop"!
@JesseKellyDC Yeah but it's a lie but a totally woke lie!
@Jami_USA It was his seminal work!
"ethical" https://t.co/ogMcTmMZQ1
@JakeHighwell @BeachyKate69 Of course!
@JammieWF @JoeC1776 It took a while to get all the response options poll-tested!
That potted plant was Harvey Weinstein's seminal work....obviously.
@whitewinery After they are done poll-testing the response alternatives!
@JoeC1776 @DLoesch Anita Dunn and SKDKnickerbocker are working OT to provide cover for #Weinstein .  	They are probably passing out favors for favorable cover.
@KatiePavlich She's busy polling her response.
@iowahawkblog @bayareahausfrau But you did get big props from Dana Perino..
@JesseKellyDC The world will never be the same!
@whitewinery Likewise. Our 2 kids are much better people than we are. #blessings
@instapundit Translation: Meryl wasn't hot enough
@Tinynikki Agreed. He made a stupid boast about how some women respond to celebrities. But I've never heard a credible report of an assault
That plant is a widya-ficus! https://t.co/YBSPNTJffy
@allahpundit @EdDriscoll Or is it "splooge"? Asking for a friend
@BenHowe One of my faves!
@BenHowe Don't be a Druish princess!
@Tinynikki I think Queens doesn't count for the SNL hall pass...
@Tinynikki @Tiffany1985B @gritshappen Wait...they smell good!......so I'm told.
@Tiffany1985B @gritshappen Do they smell like really ugly carpet?
For some reason Ashley Judd's new series promo is all over my Twitter TL.  Coincidence? I think not!
Maybe Hillary had to sign a NDA when she accepted all that sweet, sweet Weinstein cash? ü§£
@jellen805 @bayareahausfrau Me too. I sent her a tweet expressing that he was a monster but she was funny and talented
@jellen805 Well my wife got that new floor tile she wanted! It was a conspiracy I say!! ü§î
@jellen805 He is handsome but at 2 years old he can be a complete pain in the ass too! He tore up a 4 ft2 area of living room carpet! #%!*@&amp;$$$$$!
@jellen805 Ranger is a good boy! https://t.co/nmXeTxPgds
@NDH_j_m_f @LisaBloom A Faustian bargain to keep mama away from representing the accusers
@NDH_j_m_f @brownsugar7878 @ChelseaClinton I actually am a moron (by the Ace of Spades definition), so I recon she is at least correct about that!
@NDH_j_m_f @brownsugar7878 @ChelseaClinton Nope.  And @Brownsugar7878 called me a moron then bravely blocked me!
@NDH_j_m_f @brownsugar7878 @ChelseaClinton Exactly!
@brownsugar7878 @ChelseaClinton @NDH_j_m_f Because her dad used the power of his office to enable and protect his serial sexual assault of women for years she should sit this one out.
@brownsugar7878 @ChelseaClinton @NDH_j_m_f Why do you think?
@ChelseaClinton @NDH_j_m_f @ChelseaClinton maybe you should sit this one out.
@Warden_AoS Exactly! I keep thinking about Jennifer Lawrence....
@stephiegal Different!
@bayareahausfrau That was, like two years ago dude!
@Tinynikki Holding a Democrat to the same standard as a Republican would be ludicrous!
@Tinynikki @AG_Conservative The government is denying me access to my right to bear arms because they won't buy me my guns and ammo!
@jellen805 @Katascadero @ItsJustJill Nope!
@jellen805 @Katascadero @ItsJustJill He is smart and well-liked (and my Facebook friend!)
@Katascadero @jellen805 @ItsJustJill He is.  He is one of the few in this state who issues CCW permits with minimal hassle!
@Katascadero @jellen805 @ItsJustJill Our local sheriff has said he will ignore the sanctuary state BS!
@jellen805 @ItsJustJill @Katascadero Well Jefferson would be majority Republican by far which is exactly why California would never allow us to secede (with Senators).
@ItsJustJill @jellen805 @Katascadero I actually live in (Far) Nor-Cal which is a very red area in a blue state.  We call it the state of Jefferson and are moving to secede.
@ItsJustJill @jellen805 @Katascadero ü§î
@jellen805 @ItsJustJill @Katascadero I'm trapped by my business with 50 employees! Stuck until retirement!
@jellen805 @ItsJustJill The government is denying me access to my right to bear arms because they won't buy me my guns and ammo!

@LaurenSivan @NicoleT_E86 I'm really sorry you had this happen @LaurenSivan. He is a monster. You are beautiful, smart, funny, and talented!
@MaydnUSA Perfect!
Since I have a "fundamental right" to bear arms, I insist that the government buy all my guns and ammo because RIGHTS!!11!1
@ATLSAHM Yep I suspect Ashley Judd has completely re-projected her anger at Weinstein towards Trump who is a lout but never did anything to her.
@olgatuleninova Saw this one at Mus√©e Marmottan Monet! Beautiful!
@paulinaporizkov @rockhall The Cars obvi!
@seanmdav They already got #Weinstein and #HarveyWeinstein to quit trending pretty quickly!

@Tiffany1985B @jamiestorment21 @Iamdynomite1969 yep that's one hot Grandma! Amirite?
@davidharsanyi @seanmdav @brhodes needs to sit this one out.  He needs to sit all these out.
@Tiffany1985B @jamiestorment21 @Iamdynomite1969 @Tiffany1985B 's mom is actually hot...... (not too creepy)
@SuuperG @Brassmonkeynyc you should hit the @DeadRabbitNYC before quitting or I'll lose respect for your drinking stamina!
@Cernovich @Sethrogen He gives good handies I hear....
@Tiffany1985B Oh I think you have breached the hill of Twitter celebrity status (Kardashian level)! Time to start posting those belfies!
@Tiffany1985B so now that @Tiffany1985B is super internet-famous will she remember her old, crusty Twitter friends? (asking for a friend)
@DLoesch @instapundit @JesseKellyDC https://t.co/wt97eMzJj7
Interesting that #Weinstein and #HarveyWeinstein  are no longer trending. I guess Anita Dunn and the rest of the PR team called @jack ?
I came of age in the 70s so all my abusive, anti-social behaviors are totes excusable! #Weinstein
@Canine_Rights @BeachyKate69 birds of a feather......
@molratty Wow I'm going to do that too!

@seanmdav Maybe it's time to de-Google our lives?
@stephiegal @MarkSteynOnline Totes agree!

@charlieshayneo @NaughtyBeyotch Yep he probably stocked up on beer too....
@NaughtyBeyotch Yes but I can spot numerous code violations that will cause lawsuits for the deep-pocketed city not the builder.That stair is attorney bait!
@artistmorisot I bought a copy of this one. Liked it for the historical context.
@ATLSAHM Get WOKE lady!
@hezster @stephiegal The marble...
@deanriehm @stephiegal That is was what I was thinking when I saw the painting Lowell.....
@stephiegal No.
@stephiegal Yeah I thought about posting one, but my pastor follows me....so I demurred.....
@stephiegal Ok I was wrong.  This guy is much more recent and he paints some pretty naughty stuff!
@stephiegal short tie, slicked hair, 1940's? The girl has a smoke'n figure! I suppose the model had to spend a lot of time in the studio for "studies"!
@stephiegal Yea I think my dad may have rocked that look back in the day.....
@stephiegal That is sexy! But those trousers?
@GalGadot will single-handedly save the epic comic hero genre which has been very stale lately.
@stephenkruiser Thx. We'll check it out.
@stephenkruiser OK. I figured after all those visits for Red Eye, etc. you would have the town dialed in. We are going to be on Gutfeld's show and US Open.
@SalenaZito That's an old dog!!
@stephenkruiser BTW (off topic) do you have restaurant recommendations for NYC? We are going in 2 weeks. Thanks.
@stephenkruiser Ok this is true technically... but it is fun to poke Dodger fans at every opportunity Stephen!
@stephenkruiser Too bad they will choke again in the playoffs!  #Giants
@TarheelKrystle My eyes are up here you dog!
@Tiffany1985B Benedryl....I'm just saying.....

@Tiffany1985B BYOB to Moonstone! They never charge us corkage!
@Tiffany1985B We have also employed this tactic. Sad!
@TarheelKrystle I totes agree! It sucked. but Leonardo is soooooooo cute....barf!
@FDRLST @seanmdav is the cute girl included?
@Spacebunnyday I refuse to argue with @Spacebunnyday who would undoubtedly crush me like a bug!
@Spacebunnyday In general true but it's good on some things.
@ATLSAHM The gay guy in the class?
@TarheelKrystle Twitter would be boring without you!
@VanWagoner @KurtSchlichter @instapundit They will threaten someone like Manafort with prison unless he implicates trump with ANYTHING. See Scooter Libby.
@KurtSchlichter @instapundit @VanWagoner They're going to work this until they get someone to drop a dime on 	Trump to take him out.
Gourmet cajun shrimp mac and cheese makes for many dirty dishes....I'm just saying.
@ConservativeLA @SalenaZito Agreed.....
@whitewinery The Clinton cabal depends on "public service" for the big $$ to finance the lifestyle to which they have become accustomed.Chelsea must run!
My 2 cents:the trump take out op is being coordinated by Jarrett/Rhodes from the Obama residence in DC.Val's daughter at CNN.Amirite Tweeps?

@tq1 Idk. Seems like I've done that. I wonder how to update the ap. Delete and reload?
@tq1 Phone. I think the ap on my phone is outdated but when I sign in via internet it seems fine...
@JustMePammy I just tried that. Updated iPhone about a week ago.
@JustMePammy nope it's fine. I just don't get photos anymore on Twitter. I don't know how to update The Twitter ap.

@rottencoreblog @Mellecon Why don't you check with the expert, @CillizzaCNN ?
@jellen805 @Blackdi51264299 @FoxNews probably because she knows nothing....

@phillyrich1 @TomFitton @JudicialWatch The media would be going apoplectic ape-shit!
@phillyrich1 @TomFitton @JudicialWatch hiding the evidence no doubt.
@JennJacques Imagine trying to pee in that getup!
Why can I no longer view Twitter pics on my iPhone? Anyone? They can be viewed on my laptop.
The left won't quit until Trump is gone or neutered. Welcome to the swamp.

The sanctions on Russia by Obama was a trap set to catch Trump staff communications. It worked, caught Flynn. The object was to frame Trump.

It is possible to be outraged about the railroading of O'Reilly -AND believe he was a harassing a-hole who shouldn't have keep his job.
One can get an understanding of the reasoning behind the craziness of the left by researching cultural Marxism.Goal=communist utopia! Period
@RennaW Probably an "educator"!

#MarchForScience is actually the march for progressive policy promotion.  Who do these jackasses think they are fooling?

@stephiegal Yep the Monet Exhibition was awesome! 60 paintings some of which are privately owned so not often seen.  DO NOT MISS! Buy tix in advance.

@mrskimcam Our Golden, Ranger barks and tries to break it up!
@bayareahausfrau Dude!.....that was, like, six years ago!
@openculture @stephiegal thanks for the tip @stephiegal !
Looks like this tweet about #SusanRice aged well..
If Obama/Rice was spying on Trump people a year before the election one has to believe they were spying on the other candidates...
For #SusanRice and the rest of team Alinsky to lie on national TV is absolutely acceptable because the ends always justify the means.
@bayareahausfrau Wasn't Kamala also pushing for unmasking of donors to certain causes and campaigns so they could be disclosed for destruction by lefty mobs?
@jellen805 They always make the African-American woman take the fall! #racists
RT @MZHemingway: One way to restore credibility of media would be to cover the surveillance story well, stop running interference/protectio‚Ä¶
If you attack #SusanRice about any crime she may have committed you are just a dirty racist so shut up!
@stephiegal @zerohedge my millennial kids live and work in the SF Bay Area and are dying to get out.

@Tiffany1985B Moonstone Bistro?  Our fave restaurant!

@mrskimcam it was some deal on a postcard. Miami 4 nights at Hilton, 3 day cruise, rental car for 7 days. All free - no timeshare deal.
@mrskimcam yep we couldn't agree on a time for the presentation so we asked if we had to and they said not if you're from California! BINGO!

Sid Blumenthal IS the worst person in the world and he will be one of Hillary's top advisers should she get elected. Think about that.

@LibertarianSass droning is Obama's way of conducting a clean war so as not to alienate his base, and the Nobel Prize committee
@LibertarianSass OK I'll concede some points...But...when it comes to middle east policy, Israel, Russia, dithering vs deciding
@LibertarianSass yes I think so. Along with Alinsky rules, being the anti-Bush is his guiding principle.
Obama's problem is he is trying so hard to be the anti-Bush that he can't do the right thing if Valerie Jarrett deems it to be Bush-like!
