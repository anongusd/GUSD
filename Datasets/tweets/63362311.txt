@CorrieeChase How have I done that?
@CorrieeChase @karis_lockhart I've worked for the RP and I know it's hard to get things done. I want to be a team player.
@karis_lockhart @jarrettcathcart @JoshuaThifault I moved away from the CRs so if they asked that day, I wouldn't be associated.
@karis_lockhart @jarrettcathcart @JoshuaThifault I'm trying to figure out how trying to shut us down helps the CRs.

@lan917 why so you try to regulate my freedom. Seems like you're a liberal. So why not be pro-choice in letting me make my own decisions?
Why do you feel the need to regulate my 2nd amendment right? Why not focus on mental illness. Jack the Ripper used knives. Ban them. #mylife

You tried to divide by zero, didn't you? #insanity
