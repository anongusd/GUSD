@Kirblar024 @johnsoncp3j96 @RachelBitecofer @ChazNuttycombe oh I'm aware Klobuchar's toast. All I'm saying is Baldwin seems like someone Klobuchar would pick as VP on the Clinton/Gore style of doubling down (two Midwestern women, similar to Clinton/Gore being 2 young Southern white guys)
@Kirblar024 @johnsoncp3j96 @RachelBitecofer @ChazNuttycombe very true. I see Baldwin as a Sanders or O'Rourke VP pick. Maybe Klobuchar. She's experienced, has favored progressive left policies for years and would be in the history making camp as an LGBTQ+ woman. Also won re-election by double digits in a Trump state despite those things.
@johnsoncp3j96 @RachelBitecofer @ChazNuttycombe @Kirblar024 Tammy Baldwin could be a smart VP pick as a progressive midwestern senator from a state with a dem governor but I don‚Äôt know how willing the US is to elect an openly LGBTQ+ VP. That said, some didn‚Äôt think Obama had a chance due to his race so who knows
@RachelBitecofer @ChazNuttycombe @Kirblar024 You raise a good point there actually. I agree about the Veep point - think Dems will have trouble picking someone Brown since they automatically lose a crucial right leaning swing state senate seat if they win presidency.
@AlsoWonderWoman Hopefully whoever is appointed is thoroughly vetted, but really after all this mess the Dems owe it to their base to put an African-American woman like state rep. Marcia Price in charge.
@AlsoWonderWoman Probably ideal *political* scenario for Dems is for them to hold out hope that they win in the legislature this year so Herring can resign and a new AG is selected by dem legislature, followed by Northam and Fairfax resignations so new AG takes office as Governor.
@RachelBitecofer @ChazNuttycombe @Kirblar024 I could see someone like Veronica Escobar running a successful senate bid against Cruz next time around, but that‚Äôs a ways away. I think 2020 might be too soon since she‚Äôs so new in the house but who knows.
@RachelBitecofer @ChazNuttycombe @Kirblar024 He‚Äôs probably running for pres, but senate would be a much smarter move imo. Dems that don‚Äôt love him for prez would likely get behind him in a heartbeat for senate seeing as he‚Äôs not as conservative as most Senate Ds even in blue states and is the best candidate Dems have in TX

@mattyglesias Anyways, all of this is purely hypothetical but this seems like a realistic path to a Klobuchar presidency with at least somewhat broad support. If she could win a Democratic primary is a whole other story though.
@mattyglesias Also, Baldwin (as an openly LGBTQ+ Senator) could pose an interesting challenge to Mike Pence (as a staunch believer in anti LGBTQ+ policy). It also raises the question as to whether or not the US is ready to elect an openly LGBTQ+ VP, but people said similar about Obama in '08.
@mattyglesias Baldwin has very progressive policies akin to the likes of Bernie Sanders (for example, supporting single payer since at least the 1990s) while policy wise Klobuchar is more of a Hillary Clinton-esque Democrat who leads with moderation (without the toxicity of the Clinton brand)
@mattyglesias to clarify- similarity in identity, not message. Clinton and Gore were both young white guys from the South, while Klobuchar and Baldwin are both Midwestern women, a key constituency for Dems to win in 2020.
@mattyglesias An Amy Klobuchar/Tammy Baldwin ticket could be interesting; two Midwestern women, one fairly moderate, one very progressive. It would take the Clinton/Gore approach of similarity vs an Obama/Biden or Gore/Lieberman approach of contrast. Seems like a winning ticket to me.

@thehill @LeviTilleman Pepper spray, while painful will not kill a child like a gun would if they accidentally got their hands on it. While I understand the motives, giving teachers guns is a dangerous policy that contributes to an educational environment where children do not feel safe. 2/2
@thehill In addition to gun reform like expanded background checks, I support @LeviTilleman‚Äôs plan for giving teachers pepper spray to be safely stored in a locked cabinet and ONLY be used for the case of a school shooter. 1/2

@Jonweiler and Marc Hetherington's brilliant book 'Prius or Pickup?' explains our current political divide with compelling evidence to back their explanation up. A fantastic read for anyone frustrated by politics :) https://t.co/dHBWX9D1yS
@thehill If Sanders does run again, he needs ensure stringent guidelines are in place so this doesn't happen again. Any and all harassment is completely unacceptable, especially in a pres campaign. However, this and @politico's stories on the matter frame it in a very misleading way. 2/2
@thehill Very misleading headline from @thehill. These reports are highly troubling and these things are unacceptable. This article is framed to make it look like Sen. Sanders himself was being accusing which is not the case. 1/2
