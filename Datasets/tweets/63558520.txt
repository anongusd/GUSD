The gadget for measuring loaf volume is interesting. It used canola seed displacement, like a rain guage, low tech but effective.
First loaf is out of the oven, looks great. Baked with the variety Hatcher, this is the "check" loaf.
The first loaves are starting to bake, and the whole lab smells rather delicious.
1st loaves has been "punched down" in the sheeting machine, 15 loaves mixed so far. Easy to see differences in elasticity of dough.
Visiting the CSU Bake Lab - John has mixed the 1st 5 loaves of a 26 loaf bake. Yesterday, used the black powder measurer to measure yeast!
