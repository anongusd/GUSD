@thehill Well I know who pays Ingraham!
@dumptrump33 Good question for you @realDonaldTrump ......how do YOU sleep at night?    Tonight, sleep on one of those pads &amp; use one of those silver "blankets" the people that YOU put in cages have to sleep on.  I am positive you won't last 10 minutes!
@dumptrump33 @morningmika @MELANIATRUMP , like her husband @realDonaldTrump is a waste of a human.  They breathe oxygen better used on others; THEY are the aliens, not the immigrants as Trump calls people. They are useless, despicable, selfish, inhumane, ruthless, reprehensible, vile &amp; contemptable!
@peterbakernyt @SamEllison11 Hey @realDonaldTrump ...did you read this?  your policy of separating families is disgraceful and a shame to our country....so are you! Rosalynn Carter is describing you!  How do you sleep at night? How do you live with yourself? You are no more than scum on the street!
@CNN @Draniarb Hey @realDonaldTrump ....You must be so damned jealous!  Your name will go on the dumpsters at the @WhiteHouse
Hey @realDonaldTrump ! What are you doing today? Watch some cartoons, blame the Democrats for all the problems in our country, have a huge, fancy lunch &amp; dinner, more cartoons? Golf? Think about the people you put in cages, who will just stand around waiting--because of you!
@ananavarro @SamEllison11 @SenMcCain ...you are the only person in the Republican party living in reality.  We appreciate the work you are doing to bring humanity back to the Rep. party and to America!  Thank you!
@CNN @Draniarb Hey @realDonaldTrump ....This is a President that the United States is proud of; he is a Humanitarium.  His love for his fellow man is so strong he would never even consider tearing families apart like you are doing. You don't like @BarackObama --this must be killing you inside!

Hey @realDonaldTrump ! How was your nice hot breakfast this morning? Bet you had plenty of eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes &amp; hot coffee?  Think about the people in cages, hungry, wanting just a piece of toast, but won't get it--because of you!
Hey @realDonaldTrump ! How was your nice hot shower this morning? I bet you had plenty of soap &amp; shampoo? Think about the people in cages wanting a nice hot shower but won't get one--because of you!
Hey @realDonaldTrump ! How did you sleep in your big comfy bed? Think about the people sleeping on an inch thick mattresses or the floor in cages--because of you!
@ANTITRUMPMVMT Big News @realDonaldTrump !  Crime in America is way up!  The president is abusing thousands of children locked up in prisons due to his policy!
In America, we take care of our children. People that hurt our children are prosecuted to the full extent of the law.  Why the hell isn't @realDonaldTrump being prosecuted by the child abuse caused by his hands only?!?	Trump must be stopped.  This is insanity.  Sweet Jesus!
@FridaGhitis How is this happening in the United States?  The Land of the Free?!  WTF do you think you are doing @realDonaldTrump

@TeenVogue @schoolwalkoutUS This should never happen in America!	@realDonaldTrump
@votevets @SenTedCruz How will "thoughts &amp; prayers" help the people that were killed?  We need to send #Change and #GunReform and #ActionsSpeakLouderThanWords.  We need to STOP these shootings!  #Enough  How many kids will die before the govt takes action? Keep Our Kids Alive!
@wbz This should not be happening!  #GunReform
RT @MattMurph24: Want gun safety legislation? Elect more Democrats.
@schoolwalkoutUS @realDonaldTrump has done NOTHING for #GunReform!  Now we have another school shooting with at least 8 dead! Do we simply send our "thoughts &amp; prayers"? NO,our kids don't want to go to school to run from bullets..they want to learn and not be afraid at school!  #GunReform #Enough
@funder @LawyerRogelio This guy belongs in a psychiatric facility.   A Lockdown!
@TheLeadCNN @realDonaldTrump is full of shit &amp; will do what he did after Parkland...NOTHING!  These school shootings are not close enough to home for Trump to care!  Sending thoughts &amp; prayers is not enough.  We NEED change!  NOW!  #GunReform  #EnoughIsEnough  #ChangeIsNeeded
@The_UnSilent_ @realDonaldTrump Trump has to read a script because he doesn't care about these kids or any others!  Well, if his kid was in an active shooting scene, he might get off his ass &amp; do something about it!  #WhenIsItEnough?
@davidhogg111 Yes, they will send "thoughts &amp; prayers", but take no action.  They will think it won't happen again; when in fact the next shooting is already being planned out somewhere!
@realDonaldTrump President Donald Trump called the shooting an "absolutely horrific" incident. “This has been going on too long in our country," he said in remarks at a prison reform summit. So Trump, do we send thoughts &amp; prayers &amp; wait for the next school shooting--or do we finally take action?
@JudgeJudy There is a female defend. on your show that you are ripping apart!  She is in court b/c she allegedly owes back rent.  Why do you drudge up her past w/drugs &amp; the loss of her kids? That part of her life hurts. She will surely walk out of there with little self-respect!
