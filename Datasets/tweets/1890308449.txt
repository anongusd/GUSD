When Democrats like Abrams talk "free and fair elections," they mean they support policies that substantially increase the odds of voter fraud that redound to their benefit (ballot harvesting, not cleaning voter rolls, same-day registration rife with corruption, etc.). #SOTU
Stacey Abrams' #SOTU response in short: "I'm a compassionate person. Republicans are bad. Here are a plethora of standard Democratic talking points." Oh yea, and had to call into question legitimacy of her election loss, just like Hillary.
Not sure why Stacey Abrams thinks gun control and further government intervention in higher education -- which is the cause of the spiraling higher education costs in the first place -- is a winning 2020 message. #SOTU
"Faith, service, education and responsibility" was the Abrams family ethos. That really doesn't square with the Democrats' reactions during President Trump's #SOTU

THREAD: On the tyrannical nature of the administrative state, and why the Deep State represents its apotheosis https://t.co/uLVRg9UAb3 https://t.co/r4VTrn4RrU
But then, the administrative state itself represents a slow-motion, rolling, constitutional crisis. The Deep State is its apotheosis https://t.co/uLVRg9UAb3
The attempt to “Resist” by those tasked w/ ensuring NatSec and conducting foreign affairs (areas in which POTUS has significant latitude) represents an administrative state-driven constitutional crisis https://t.co/uLVRg9UAb3
It isn't the Deep State’s job to police a POTUS because it disagrees with or is threatened by his policies. That power falls to the Congress as rep of the people, and ultimately to the people themselves https://t.co/uLVRg9UAb3
Those who've sought to subvert/sideline POTUS within administrative institutions have more than crossed a red line. They're violating consent of the governed. They're serving as a de facto check-and-balance w/o authority. They're eviscerating Const govt https://t.co/uLVRg9UAb3
The administrative state continues its work in defense of itself/against the POTUS under whose discretion it serves. The goal isn't just to punish Trump, but to criminalize Trumpism, and anyone who would dare deign to deconstruct the administrative state https://t.co/uLVRg9UAb3
The Deep State has become a branch within a branch. It is one thing for Congress to delegate power to executive agencies. It is another for those agencies to dominate the executive https://t.co/uLVRg9UAb3 https://t.co/SM0JBSFD09
Here is a small sampling of the Deep State's chicanery in seeking to bring down a president who threatens their chosen policies and prerogatives https://t.co/uLVRg9UAb3
The politicization/weaponization of bureaucracies that exist to protect American life and limb is disastrous on every level. The effort to undermine and ultimately destroy the executive via the Deep State is a beyond chilling development https://t.co/uLVRg9UAb3
In seeking to deconstruct the administrative state, the administrative state has sought to deconstruct the Trump administration and, with it, a restoration of a modicum of constitutional rule https://t.co/uLVRg9UAb3
The result of Trump's efforts to rein in the administrative state has been an unprecedented backlash that has brought the danger of an out-of-control bureaucracy into stark relief https://t.co/uLVRg9UAb3
It was not just that President Trump sought to deregulate, or prescribe a set of policies anathema to our bureaucracy. Trump was deemed an existential threat to the power and prestige of our betters https://t.co/uLVRg9UAb3
While the elites mocked and derided President Trump, they also apparently took his threat to the privileges and prerogatives conferred upon them by the administrative state regime more seriously than they did the threat of any of his predecessors https://t.co/uLVRg9UAb3
President Trump is the preeminent administrative state unmasker. In spite of, or perhaps bc of, his focus on practicality over philosophy, elevation of forgotten man over the reflexively prog establishment during the '16 elec, he set out to deconstruct it https://t.co/uLVRg9UAb3
The administrative state unmoors the govt from the people it exists to represent. In its place, we get a govt in which powers are unlawfully delegated from the leg to exec agencies, checks/balances collapse, separated powers are blurred, injustice abounds https://t.co/uLVRg9UAb3
The administrative state creates the perverse circumstance in which an individual might find him- or herself up against a single agency playing legislator, regulator, judge, jury, and executioner all at once. This scenario defines tyranny https://t.co/uLVRg9UAb3
The administrative state is the living manifestation of progressivism’s Long March through the institutions. It's a fourth branch of govt that usurps/combines the powers of the others, leading them to collude in the scheme, while cannibalizing themselves https://t.co/uLVRg9UAb3

QUICK THREAD on wealth taxes, 70% tax rates and government-imposed "equality" morality -- all in the face of Venezuela's man-caused socialist disaster https://t.co/OlSLOs9y4U
Would reckon we could save trillions of dollars over time if every American read a copy of Bastiat's "The Law" and/or Hazlitt's "Economics in One Lesson." Would work much better than folks like Sanders, Warren and AOC seeking to micromanage and centrally plan our lives
This is yet another instance of progressives trying to impose their religion of Statism on us -- deigning to believe that they have not only the right but the duty to impose their morality on the public through any and all means (all while increasing their own power of course)
If no nat'l consensus, why should some fraction of ppl be able to vote to strip away the wealth of other ppl? A truly moral, just system would entail a limited govt that imposes the minimum possible burden on all citizens -- who are the ones who create wealth in the first place
If Sen Warren et al believe there's something resembling a national consensus about implementing an annual wealth tax, why impose it by government force? Shouldn't individuals be willing to just cut checks to the UST if they really want to give the government more power?
The great thing about capitalism -- not cronyism, but capitalism -- is that the only way people can become rich enough to draw the ire of the statist wealth redistributors is to create the wealth in the first place by providing a good or service that people freely choose to buy
Simply put, the wealth redistributors from Warren to de Commio believe that the State should play G-d, imposing its perverse form of morality, via legalized expropriation, on the public. The power to tax wealth will fast become the power to destroy it

@rickungar You too. We’ll circle back over the coming years. Sadly I think your Party will leave you on this
@rickungar Here’s Obama’s words, along with others. You care about positions of Members on BDS, but discount their raising of this odious argument here? I wouldn’t draw such a distinction https://t.co/0og3blUgaA
@rickungar The voice vote had to be held multiple times among the delegates of your party, and G-d and Jerusalem were booed. Villaraigosa has to force through the voice vote when he didn’t have it. Meanwhile, the Ukraine argument is also a canard https://t.co/rcRHEWZUdO
@rickungar Rick the leadership in your party supported Jew-baiting via the dual loyalty canard. Doesn’t matter your position on Iran Deal. That’s unacceptable bigotry. Tablet isn’t a right-wing rag, look at what its editors said https://t.co/TNLtlbqGk6
@rickungar As I noted, the positions of all Dems in the primary will be a telling data point. It’s only one in terms of directionally where the Party has been moving. Do you disagree that the ‘12 platform vote re G-d and Jerusalem was notable? Or dual loyalty canard argument re Iran Deal?
@rickungar I’d also say it’s not the only true metric when the Iran Deal echo chamber raised the dual loyalty canard repeatedly in service of Iran Deal. That’s the top of the Democratic Party’s line. Irrelevant? https://t.co/TNLtlbqGk6
@rickungar Well we had a vote on it in just the last couple weeks. You’ll dispute the rationale, but the numbers are what they are. Let’s see where all the primary candidates on the Dem side come out. I think it’s clear the way this is trending. See D platform in ‘12 https://t.co/Nb3eEXCTJ7

Lastly, those who during the prior admin supported ceding the Middle East to Iran and the Russians, and bowing down to Turkey-Qatar-Muslim Brotherhood really have shown themselves to be completely disingenuous and political in their unhinged apoplexy
Plus a % of Iran dissidents. There are few Jeffersonian Ds. We shouldn’t be using our military assets to clear the field of one set of bad guys only to replace them w/ another. And we shouldn’t arm jihadis, which is what we did in Syria — weapons always end up pointed back at us
In all the hysterics of the last 24 hours, few are articulating anything resembling a coherent vision of our national interest in the Middle East, and what it requires based on a clear-eyed view of the harsh reality that the only truly liberal allies are Israel and the Kurds...
There’s likely overlap in these interests, not all require armed forces en masse on ground in perpetuity, but may have to prioritize. When we know in our own minds the ends, then we can evaluate most effective means, ie arming Kurds to hilt, sowing discord bt enemies, cyberwar...
Syria — and all the ME — rests on question of what our goals are, which drives strategies &amp; tactics. America has to articulate whether it is rollback of Iran’s Shia Crescent (which goes way beyond just Syria), countering Russian/Chinese influence, destroying Sunni jihadi groups..

THREAD: On the anti-Israel UN resolutions and their true significance, Trump vs. Obama and the Jews, Jew-hatred Left and Right, and cynical politics over anti-Semitism https://t.co/PSFc248osx 👇 https://t.co/mxBj23dE5S
The attempt to associate the pro-Israel Trump admin with such anti-Semitism is not only absurd on its face, but shameful. It obscures the view from the true foes of the Jewish people — at home and abroad — who ultimately too are foes of the West itself https://t.co/PSFc248osx
The ignorance or at best indifference towards the anti-Semitism exhibited routinely at the UN and elsewhere suggests the awakening in the face of the Tree of Life massacre may have been largely political – virtue-signaling – which is a sad commentary https://t.co/PSFc248osx
Where there is hostility towards Israel in particular, it is overwhelmingly on the Left. Said hostility towards Israel is almost always inextricably intertwined with Jew-hatred, try as the Left might to ignore it https://t.co/PSFc248osx
The Left has cynically tried to use non-Islamist, non-Leftist attacks on Jews as a cudgel against Trump admin under the foggy idea he’s created a “climate of hate” (belied by facts) curiously ignoring the climate created by the policies of his predecessor https://t.co/PSFc248osx https://t.co/0B1reAhgrv
The over-the-top chastising of Israel, the holding of Israel to an unreachable double standard and the elevating of Israel’s jihadist foes illustrates self-evident hostility towards Jews. It predominates on the progressive Left https://t.co/PSFc248osx https://t.co/3I0i5WcGNL
It really is an amazing contrast to look at the Trump admin’s record on Israel versus that of Obama. The smears of anti-Semitism truly define “chutzpah.” https://t.co/PSFc248osx https://t.co/lFrKtEwFyv
It’s the Trump administration that the Left has smeared as somehow culpable for the Tree of Life massacre that has provided an unprecedented level of support for the Jewish nation of Israel https://t.co/PSFc248osx https://t.co/vlv0Q02kE6
Those who assented to these hateful anti-Israel resolutions weren’t “right-wing” white nationalists, or neo-Nazis. Rather, the non-Islamic European regimes who voted to throw Israel to the wolves are primarily run by left-leaning, globalist bureaucrats. https://t.co/PSFc248osx
UN representatives for multiple billion people endorsed vile, anti-Semitic resolutions. The institution refused to condemn Hamas. Should not this stoke widespread outrage when just several weeks back America was transfixed with the scourge of Jew-hatred? https://t.co/PSFc248osx
With the UNGA resolutions exemplifying such brazen Jew-hatred, or at best a craven silence in its face, at a preeminent world forum, one wonders: Where are the endless columns and hours of television coverage condemning the Israel-condemners? https://t.co/PSFc248osx
It bears highlighting how stark these anti-Israel votes were: All of THREE world powers, US, CA, AU (not EU) voted w Israel on all 6 resolutions, against what Daniel P Moynihan — a man who’d be booted from his party today — referred to as the “jackals” https://t.co/PSFc248osx
The unique, uniquely one-sided, morally relativistic diplomatic offensive whereby retrograde powers treat free and pluralistic Israel as the worst nation on Earth, cursed with a constant asterisk next to its name, gives away the anti-Semitic game https://t.co/PSFc248osx
When it comes to Israel, basic rights and responsibilities -- including those imperative to any nation’s survival such as defending its sovereignty and protecting its people from terror -- are criminalized at the UN https://t.co/PSFc248osx
UN singles out the world’s sole Jewish state to an egregious extent; holds it to an unreachable, self-sacrificial standard, that in practice would only be satisfied by its destruction. Why silence from those gravely concerned over Jew-hatred mere days ago? https://t.co/PSFc248osx

Always ironic when you evaluate the perjury charge against Gen Flynn -- one of the perfectly lawful conversations he conducted with Kislyak was aimed at dissuading Russia from supporting an Obama admin-backed anti-Israel UN resolution. Likely one of the reasons they loathed him. https://t.co/Jd2lfOWzwP

@RLHeinrichs @JerylBier By equating raising relevant background that creates a less sympathetic character w/ smearing someone and condoning their presumed murder -- something we've all condemned -- it exposes how unhinged and emotionally invested so many are in cynically leveraging this alleged atrocity
@RLHeinrichs @JerylBier It in part gives away the game that many in media are pro-MB.

On the contrary, refusing to partner with those who might help us further our security interests, thereby imperiling our citizens, would be the height of immorality	https://t.co/N7XHbzSQ5l

Our govt's paramount role is to protect life/liberty. Pursuit of our natsec/natl interest requires at times working w immoral regimes, requiring keen judgment, prioritizing principles v objectives. Doing everything we can to protect ourselves isn't immoral	https://t.co/N7XHbzSQ5l
Some are using Khashoggi saga as a cynical ploy to pressure Trump admin to upend its partnership w regimes that, although brutal and repressive, share a common adversary in Iran, and may be useful in suppressing jihad. They do US natl interest no good	https://t.co/N7XHbzSQ5l
None of the actors with which we must deal in the Middle East save for Israel believe in anything resembling Western values. But America must operate in the world as it is, rather than as we wish it to be.	https://t.co/N7XHbzSQ5l
The same media and establishment accepting salacious and unverified Turkish sources as paragons of truth re Khashoggi, that has in the past sprung to protect the Muslim Brotherhood, is again all-in when it comes to a political Islamist MB-fellow traveler	https://t.co/N7XHbzSQ5l https://t.co/Lfj8SQe4N7
We saw Muslim Brotherhood echo chamber rise when the Trump admin initially considered designating the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization. It rose again in an effort to smear counterjihadists @SecPompeo and @AmbJohnBolton as Islamophobic bigots	https://t.co/N7XHbzSQ5l
"Democracy" in the Middle East for the media/establishment has long meant tyranny of the Sharia supremacist majority, NOT liberalism. A reliable Muslim Brotherhood echo chamber -- akin to Ben Rhodes' Iran Deal echo chamber, has arisen to advance this cause	https://t.co/N7XHbzSQ5l https://t.co/Cn1a6X56Ng
The answer here is that not only does media view Khashoggi as essential to its anti-Trump, pro-Iran policy. Also consistent with the Obama admin, the media and much of the pol establishment has long viewed partnership with Muslim Brotherhood as essential	https://t.co/N7XHbzSQ5l https://t.co/AKSMP3j5gU
Khashoggi viewed political Islam as essential to freedom and "democracy." Isn't it curious that media would conceal Khashoggi's defense of a system of theocratic tyranny antithetical to human rights, free press, all other things media claims to cherish?	https://t.co/N7XHbzSQ5l https://t.co/4n0z4hEryn
But the hidden element that is perhaps most telling about the media's portrayal of Khashoggi as a romantic freedom fighter is how ardently he defended political Islam -- read Sharia theocracy -- till the end. Why do they ignore this?	https://t.co/N7XHbzSQ5l https://t.co/lpAN9LjVRJ
3) The media believes in protecting its own, and virtue-signaling. How else to explain hyperbolic outrage and moral hysteria over Saudis being Saudis re an Islamist dissident? This is sadly but obviously standard fare in the Middle East	https://t.co/N7XHbzSQ5l https://t.co/rXe2CFoARG
The hundreds of thousands dead in Iran-backed Syria, where Obama admin's chief contributions included arming ISIS and ceding control to Russia, are a testament to media/establishment comfort setting aside values when pursuing interests. https://t.co/N7XHbzSQ5l
Recall however that media/establishment now up in arms over potentially maintaining Saudi relationship in spite of alleged savagery was perfectly acceptable sacrificing values for interests re Iran Deal, rise of MB in Egypt/jihadis in Libya, Russian reset https://t.co/N7XHbzSQ5l
2) Khashoggi serves one of the media's favorite narratives about Trump embracing authoritarians/harboring authoritarian tendencies (rather than that FoPo requires at times partnering w/ unsavory regimes that reject our values to advance greater interests)	https://t.co/N7XHbzSQ5l https://t.co/O8GhIj7pNc
The answer is threefold: 1) Khashoggi is being used as a cudgel against the Trump foreign policy -- specifically trying to scuttle the counterjihadist/Iran containment policy of which Saudi is the lynchpin in the Islamic world	https://t.co/N7XHbzSQ5l https://t.co/7gYjzdQpQ5
From Riyadh, to Ankara, to Tehran, the media and establishment surely know that tyranny is the rule rather than the exception. The question is why this one alleged act of barbarism trumps all others in their eyes	https://t.co/N7XHbzSQ5l
It's to recognize that narrative the media/establishment is portraying here of presumed murder of a freedom-fighting journalist to upend our entire couterjihadist, Iran containment policy in the region -- before we have any evidence -- deserves skepticism	https://t.co/N7XHbzSQ5l
To acknowledge Khashoggi was an advocate for political Islam till the end, served as a mouthpiece for alleged al-Qaeda-tied Saudi intel chief Turki bin Faisal and had curiously close access to and mourned death of bin Laden isn't to condone alleged murder	https://t.co/N7XHbzSQ5l
Why has media/establishment made the presumed murder of an Islamist Saudi dissident in Turkey THE defining issue in US FoPo? He's being used cynically to advance its agenda -- contra Trump-Gulf-Israel partnership, pro Turkey-Qatar-Iran-Muslim Bhood.	https://t.co/N7XHbzSQ5l THREAD
@JerylBier This is more nuanced than can be conveyed in 280 words -- requires knowledge and context of classical Islamic jurisprudence of which Khashoggi was presumably very familair
@JerylBier Re first point about writing for Western audience in English -- not only do I raise that bc in Arabic the translated words may be different, but also bc if you accept he was an Islamist, there is a double meaning to words like "freedom," "terrorism" in context of Islamic law
@JerylBier Consider: He's writing for Western audience in English; what NYT (apt to portray him favorably) writes about his MB leanings https://t.co/MdZwOKIpuh; favorable writings re MB-spawn Hamas; other public work. MB = Sharia tyranny - only democratic insofar as ppl could vote for it

@KJTorrance And as per my original set of questions, I think it’s important to understand why he was reportedly granted such status and given a post at WaPo given his extensive Muslim Brotherhood and Saudi intel ties https://t.co/KLXHAKcnbG
@KJTorrance It’d be a brazen gambit if that is what transpired. But the framing of the narrative implies a disingenuousness on the part of the media and establishment that deserves examination. This reads much more like a Turkey-Qatar-Iran-MB vs. Saudi squabble than what’s been portrayed
Please go on Senator Warren https://t.co/FcJ8ru9628
@KJTorrance No. The point is that there’s critical context missing here, and it’s awfully curious why this specific case involving a devoted Muslim Brotherhood supporter who isn’t a US citizen is causing cries across the establishment for dismantling our entire Middle East policy
@delaneymeyer46 @jimsx50 No. I’m saying the context is pivotal yet ignored here, and it’s curious why the media is up in arms in this specific case given what is alleged is the status quo across the Middle East. Why is this time different, meriting the dismantling of US foreign policy in the region?

The advocacy of violence in politics indicates an unwillingness to engage on the basis of ideas and reasoned persuasion. It flies in the face of not only Western civilization, but civilization itself, where the rule of law is supposed to trump the rule of the strong.
