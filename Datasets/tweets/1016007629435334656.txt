@essenviews I know it sounds weird, but here's the solution.. do NOT impeach him, that will make him a martyr and Pence will pardon him. And don't replace him with a Democrat... America will never have a moment of peace... Replace him with an Independent President, who will NEVER pardon him!
@thehill Maybe he can build a Wall on our Western border to stop Kim's missiles... Then he can stay in Washington DC and get some work done...
@DebarringtonH @markyzaguirre @derekahunter America will never achieve greatness until ALL Americans are allowed to be happy. Anyone who mocks their fellow Americans is therefore an Enemy of the People.
@inkedsurfer Well, if he nailed her to the wall they'd lose sponsors... I don't use commercial media for that very reason.

@MusicalKasparov @TJ_TomJ @nickgillespie @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump @Potus declared an emergency and said it wasn't an emergency in the same breath.

@eugenegu When this "National Emergency" charade is over, either @GOP or @realDonaldTrump is going to be crippled - greed has split the party and the president. I think @RandPaul has chosen personal survival as the best option! https://t.co/vUPpzpqr2e

@stephenseidel1 @GOPLeader @POTUS Every @GOP member in Congress has to make a terrible choice. Grovel before a president who no longer hides his lies and incompetence, or ditch the liar and survive to fight another day - those 13 chose survival! https://t.co/vUPpzpqr2e

@twigirlfan @KyungLahCNN @marchbaby1972 I was not surprised. @DNC is so out of touch with voters, they actually think that for 2020 they can rename themselves "the party of the people" and no one will notice it's the same old "Tax and Spend" as before! https://t.co/SA6RGzmUyV

@Gophergutz1 @politico @DNC @GOP I believe asking people to choose the least evil of the 2 major parties is a form of voter suppression. I think 53%? of eligible voters voted in 2016. Take out those who voted reluctantly or defensively, add the 47% who didn't vote, there's a solid majority for an Independent

@TeaPainUSA I thought any publicity was good publicity?
@thismainelife @joncoopertweets @shivie Does that really make it trend higher?
@TeaPainUSA Old news, isn't it? Did something just declassify?
@AnnCoulter We know he's lying already... Wall, taxes, marriage vows, whatever
@coleyworld If you're the consumer, no problem... If this happened at the mattress store, you're fucked!
@matthewjdowd 50 years ago people were smarter... Those clown-babies couldn't hold a job shoveling manure!
@peterdaou @LindseyGrahamSC A dedicated politician trying to keep a failing career afloat
@RyanAFournier Remember that video that didn't show the whole story and everyone went ape shit about it and was wrong?
@RealJamesWoods I don't wish to defend the @DNC, but I would like to remind you that a bunch of losers who couldn't hack it in Europe came here, slaughtered the natives, stole the land, enslaved millions... There's more, but Twitter: We ARE the criminals, we ARE the illegals!
@ToddHagopian Your teenager keeps blowing up your credit card, do you sell the house or get an additional job? Cutting spending is actually the FIRST resort
@WhiteHouse Diet Coke is a drug, @GOP is a gang, and our president is a criminal... So no wall required, it IS simple!
@michael_truck Did you notice the inconsistent diction? I didn't reply because I think there's something wrong with that account... It's human but I don't think it's American
@WhiteRabbitMama @HavranekJudi @MarkHertling @mkraju This conference might go better if they expel the American delegation

@DonnaThorson @MollyJongFast @JordanUhl Who's the old fat guy in the hat and why did they let him inside that exclusive resort?
@TreasuresByJC @RyanAFournier Obama was not participating in the 2016 election... This whole argument is horse crap.
@ewarren You maybe should clear this with your @DNC handlers first...
@cpnbca1 @mcclurecentral @4everNeverTrump @realDonaldTrump He's not as smart as you think
@WhiteHouse Criminals like our president, gangs like @GOP ... wait, aren't they supposed to be on the OTHER side of the wall?
@TravisAllen02 Hey wait, they just built a wall around Taco Bell, where are we supposed to eat?

@RyanAFournier Did you just try to use Obama to justify the orange crested buffoon?
@officialmcafee @danv9119 We the People are getting screwed. But we also outnumber those who are screwing us! @GOP and @DNC have divided the People, if we unite against them, they won't survive 2020
@NathanHRubin @joncoopertweets Heading out to the farmer's market, we ran out of organic produce so we'll just have to take our chances...
@PhillisjSmith3 Let's put him in blackface first..
@EricBoehlert @MalcolmNance Oh .. read the "he's going to die in prison" before I saw who "he" was... That's what you get for cheating, lying, and stealing. Sucks to be held accountable for your actions!
@FiregryphonFit @SirOdus007 @17frosted @politvidchannel Missing the point... @GOP AND @DNC favor the rich, and to maintain control over the populace, have convinced everyone there is no alternative. The American People don't have a real voice, that's why most of them don't bother to vote.

@LizaGoitein I'm guessing that line wasn't on the teleprompter and about 20 of his lawyers just shit their pants
@rachelheldevans @CRafaMir Our current president is a guinea pig puppet: after his controllers learn what they can get away with, they'll dump Bozo and bring in the real Dr Evil
@sahilkapur The very title, "President's Day", has been tainted... After I'm elected I'll rename it something more honorable
@brianschatz Cleverest thing I've heard today
@politvidchannel Of course he had to call them - they have no motivation to lie for him on their own!

@DreamWeaver61 I'm thinking of tearing down the White House and putting up something more modest that runs on solar and wind. Do they make a bullet-proof plug-in hybrid?
@thompsonlisaa @Independent So many talented candidates, but you'll only get to vote for one of them... kind of a waste, isn't it? https://t.co/AGvdfrSYa2
@EdanClay Agreed. How is it 2019 and these clowns can still talk like this is normal?
@Harikon709 @Rodrigo72738351 @ARKANSAWCHAP73 @MrMattyChappy @CNN A wall can be built, 4 years later it can be torn down. If Bozo wants a legacy, he should focus on something more lasting, like bipartisan immigration reform that every American can get behind. THAT would put him in the history books for sure, but I don't think he's that smart..
@Vicki_Land503 @ewarren @Resist___45 @DNC will try to attack Bozo with the most radical nominee they can find - and a win for the party is still a loss for the People https://t.co/Dsa2WQKfFw
@jvaughnwilson @apodoxus @alanlledesma @ewarren There will be big bucks waiting at the end of the tunnel if she can be the MOST EXTREME DEMOCRAT and win the nomination!

@senatemajldr @POTUS "Immediately open the government" doesn't fix the damage you've already caused. The American People are not bargaining chips for your power games, and your undying devotion to an ignorant tyrannical fool will never be forgotten
@WhiteHouse Because of the president's actions, the American People suffered needlessly, and just saying, "we're open!" doesn't erase the damage done. Enjoy your fucking weekend, Asshole!
Shutdown over... Sure... But the damage you've done doesn't fix itself so quickly... @GOP and @DNC I will never forget the needless suffering your power struggle has inflicted on the American People

@ToddHagopian I'm sorry, diets don't work... I've tried most of them. Stop eating refined sugar, go for whole grain products, and exercise 30 minutes, even just walking, every day. Throw away your scale, how you feel is the only measurement that matters.

@lynayers @lisastoi @hope4_usa @denisetru89 @cookinaunt @realTrumpForce @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Your first sentence is perfect. And consider Congress spends Trillions fighting illegal overseas wars, $5B is nothing. Why does the word "wall" mean 800,000 people out of work? The shutdown is political, that's why I blame both sides. An Independent President could fix this today
@bby_lotion @ToxicExplodley @iamjimmyweber @lisastoi @hope4_usa @denisetru89 @cookinaunt @realTrumpForce @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse And you've seen how much money is spent on their campaigns? It's party money, guaranteeing they vote the party line... If our current President would have run as a self-funded Independent, I still would hate him, but maybe respect him just a little for that...
@denisetru89 @bby_lotion @ToxicExplodley @iamjimmyweber @lisastoi @hope4_usa @cookinaunt @realTrumpForce @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse If the President were neither a Democrat or Republican.... no matter how much they hate each other they would have to work together....

@lonquest @KimiJannaGold @sheilafaye01_g @AikenCountyDems @senatemajldr Keep following the logic chain - every @GOP senator is complicit because they could remove Mitch if they wanted to. Root cause: Partisanship. Solution: remove @GOP and @DNC from the White House. No matter how much they hate each other, and Independent President forces cooperation
@RKJones16 @hope4_usa @denisetru89 @cookinaunt @realTrumpForce @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse The logical solution to avoid future problems - Get the @GOP and @DNC out of the White House. If the President isn't on EITHER side, no matter how much they hate each other they'll have to work together.
@SharknessaWhite @stacigo @kylegriffin1 @lovebscott So put an Independent President in the White House. Problem solved. No matter how much @GOP and @DNC hate each other, they'll have to work together.
@SharknessaWhite @JNettieB @stacigo @kylegriffin1 @lovebscott I agree that the wall is stupid. But you don't put 800,000 people out of work over $5B, when you're perfectly fine with spending Trillions fighting illegal wars overseas. Build the stupid wall. Tear it down in a few years. Don't fuck with People's lives for political reasons
@MelMain6 @lisastoi @hope4_usa @denisetru89 @cookinaunt @realTrumpForce @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse The simplest solution is to put an Independent President in the White House. Partisanship causes gridlock: and shutdowns. A neutral stance from the White House forces bi-partisanship in Congress.
@reidthepatriot @sheilafaye01_g @AikenCountyDems @senatemajldr Exactly why I want @DNC and @GOP out of the White House. I don't care who has the majority in Congress, an Independent President eliminates the gridlock the first day in office.
@Stuntman_Jake @denisetru89 @cookinaunt @realTrumpForce @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse I agree completely with your statement. The issue of border security should be the most non-partisan issue ever. @DNC AND @GOP are fighting for power and money - not the American People. An Independent President could fix this in no time.

@ItsJeffHudson Vice President is a shit job, in Hell, he'll be a Prince!
@RepSwalwell You have the luxury of choosing how you spend the next 4 hours of your life: BECAUSE of the sacrifices that great man made. You have your life in front of you, 4 hours is nothing!
@PoliticalEmilia The @dnc will spend billions to ensure if she IS elected she will be corrupted before taking office. If she ran as an independent she would be the best President ever.
@politvidchannel She would beat the orange crested buffoon anytime anywhere. Unfortunately that specific contest is not likely to occur.
@SheriAWilkinson @HowardA_Esq It's Kentucky. Lower your expectations.
@BdStiff @Patricia99801 @lisamurkowski @SenDanSullivan @SenMajLdr If those senators were representing their states, they would vote Mitch down. They are representing their party.
@ZKERGAYE @TheresaBug59 @CNN @realDonaldTrump I hope you're wrong - I don't watch TV BTW maybe that's why I have these radical ideas that independence, intelligence, and incorruptibility are more important than party loyalty and money. Keep marching, even if it's uphill...
@TheresaBug59 @ZKERGAYE @CNN @realDonaldTrump That's exactly what I'm trying to avoid. Although maybe it's already started for some people...
@bby_lotion @ToxicExplodley @iamjimmyweber @lisastoi @hope4_usa @denisetru89 @cookinaunt @realTrumpForce @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Truth - Right here 👆
@gramanissa @denisetru89 @cookinaunt @realTrumpForce @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse 800,000 lost their income. They have dependents. So it's millions, just for the directly affected. Indirect effects are even more broadly scattered.
@hope4_usa @bby_lotion @ToxicExplodley @iamjimmyweber @lisastoi @denisetru89 @cookinaunt @realTrumpForce @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse "Illegal alien deported multiple times" - if the purpose was to come here and kill Americans, wouldn't they have done it the first time?
@laketahoe71 @stacigo @kylegriffin1 @lovebscott McConnell could be removed. But that would require @GOP members support so we're back to my premise - allegiance to party rather than constituents brought us the shutdown. Put in an Independent President, such as myself, and the gridlock disappears.
@19Rich68 @lisastoi @hope4_usa @denisetru89 @cookinaunt @realTrumpForce @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse I find no fault with your logic
@LindaPankewicz @TommyBoy_2024 @stacigo @kylegriffin1 @lovebscott Very nice - the mugger says "give me your wallet" and then negotiates down to just taking all your cash - what a deal!!
@ccrotelli123 @iamjimmyweber @lisastoi @hope4_usa @denisetru89 @cookinaunt @realTrumpForce @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse I suggested in my video that CBP should just open the gates since they're not being paid. That should solve the problem very quickly.
@bby_lotion @ToxicExplodley @iamjimmyweber @lisastoi @hope4_usa @denisetru89 @cookinaunt @realTrumpForce @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse I compare it to taxing oxygen. People will still breathe, even if you've taken all their money. People will still come, by whatever means necessary. You could kill them, but some would still get through. And then you'd be like those other countries we say we are different from.
@bby_lotion @ToxicExplodley @iamjimmyweber @lisastoi @hope4_usa @denisetru89 @cookinaunt @realTrumpForce @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse If 535 members of Congress can't even come up with a 50.01% majority on these issues, we've got the wrong people working on the wrong problems. If replacing Congress is too drastic, at least break down the issues into smaller bites where a solid majority can be established
@kbpierso @hope4_usa @denisetru89 @cookinaunt @realTrumpForce @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse If elected officials faithfully represented their constituents, it is  impossible that 535 members of Congress could be deadlocked. They have  chosen party over people. Never let them forget that choice.
@42Observeu @denisetru89 @cookinaunt @realTrumpForce @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Ironic, isn't it? Most people consider a "government job" to be all stable and cushy - Believe me, I'm not running for office because I expect it to be a better job! It's more like self-defense!
@DC2IM2BK Presidents aren't supposed to be writing legislation. As for budgets - our current president ran a casino into bankruptcy. Anyone could do better.
@einnocinc @CRoA4thepeople @denisetru89 @cookinaunt @realTrumpForce @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse If we could separate money from party - the problem would solve itself.

@SkylerRosey @denisetru89 @cookinaunt @realTrumpForce @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Everyone should have an "Emergency" fund. But when the emergency is voluntarily invented by our Government for political reasons - that's inexcusable. Everyone involved should be removed from office.

@DC2IM2BK That wouldn't be logical, but all votes are appreciated! The point is, I'm not a celebrity, billionaire, or career politician: I'm not doing this to get rich or to boost my own ego. I am just like 99% of Americans - unlike any major party candidate!
@victorkojak1 @JimTwohawks @denisetru89 @cookinaunt @realTrumpForce @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Actually, the Declaration of Independence says governments are created to secure the rights of the people. If we wanted a tyrant controlling all aspects of our lives we could have stayed with England...
@IslandAlthea @RVAwonk @DemWrite I'm after the votes that aren't cast at all because many Americans can't bring themselves to choose between the 2 choices presented by the major parties. Vote-dividing is what the GOP and DNC have already done - I'm vote-unifying!

@Mamasan2k @SharknessaWhite @ThotsuneMiku @stacigo @kylegriffin1 @lovebscott Here's an idea - seize land using "eminent domain" to build the wall, DON'T build the wall, years later a new golf resort emerges on the banks of the Rio Grande - Don't tell me he hasn't thought about it!!!

@ShellW5470 @SuziVo5661 @UGAGal28 @just2btj @stareagle @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @SecNielsen Given the profits involved, no physical barrier will stop drug smuggling. Better to remove the financial incentives for smugglers, making it unprofitable.

@SuziVo5661 @ShellW5470 @UGAGal28 @just2btj @stareagle @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @SecNielsen And why aren't ALL drugs classified equally? Have you ever seen a toddler coming off a sugar buzz or a smoker who hasn't had the morning cigarette? Anything that causes withdrawal symptoms is a drug, right? It's just a question of bribing the right people I guess!
@UGAGal28 @just2btj @stareagle @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @SecNielsen I don't depend on the President of the United States to protect me from drugs. I can protect myself. And if you depend solely on your government for ANY part of your life, are you truly free? Government was invented to protect individual rights, not to make us dependent!

Congress adjourned for the weekend with no apparent progress... @GOP @DNC THIS is the problem! NO ONE GETS TO GO HOME DURING A SHUTDOWN! #AskSteveRicheyAnything
The American People need a President who understands their needs. I interact with hundreds of ordinary people every day - do you think our current president does that? https://t.co/wr54GUfwPK
@brianschatz I realize this isn't what you meant.. but I interact with hundreds of people every day: I know what the American People think and need, because I am one of them! https://t.co/wr54GUfwPK

@gantwick @NPR On behalf of the LEADERS of the world... Thanks... Maybe we can get something done this time!
@ToddHagopian Are you by any chance calling this debacle a "witch hunt"?
@jtbass2756 @alllibertynews @justinamash Any current member of Congress waving the @GOP or @DNC flag can be assumed to be corrupted by the party money train, and had forgotten the American People within hours of winning the election.
@UncleSteveHarmn It's some sort of verification, but I don't have it either...
@UncleSteveHarmn Test..
@teestark When I realized @NPR was going to interrupt to bring me coverage: I drove to a remote location with no radio signals, and went for a run on a deserted road. His dream is our nightmare.
@Castaldo2018 @LPNational Exactly. Rational - and STOP...
@AndrewGillum @realDonaldTrump When I found out that @NPR was going to interrupt @npratc for that crap, I drove to a remote location and went running - I feel even more intelligent than I was earlier!
@TomthunkitsMind Maybe we shouldn't have a President who is a billionaire, celebrity, or career politician. https://t.co/WJ2w1lyKph

@glibbertarian @LPNational The hardest part of being a Libertarian is when our national party goes off on some theoretical tangent and now everyone thinks I'm going to open the borders and flood us with immigrants overnight. Driving people away right into the orange crested buffoon's base.
@Syr829 @activist360 @Lawrence I'm curious if he is having trouble, like me, filing his financial reports with the FEC, which remains closed?
@psalm91_1 @LPNational Definitely a humanitarian crisis exists. The crisis which is fixed by a wall is what I don't see...
@Loriloriahess @Brasilmagic Criminal psychologists say a person who suffers anxiety AFTER arrest is hiding something.... Keep digging...
@ItsJeffHudson I think it's over, anything truthful or intelligent in there? Lol
@NPR FYI I will be at work this evening when the orange-crested buffoon makes his speech, enjoying my usual Hawaii Public Radio programming. If you DARE interrupt the intelligence I will no doubt be enjoying - I will spend the rest of my evening @KTUH_FM
@BrowningStephen @ProudResister Time and information can both be assigned a monetary value. His speech will consist mainly of bullshit, contain no factual information, and will be a waste of our time. Only watch if you're getting paid to watch.
@ItsJeffHudson @Trumper1620 I follow my adversaries closely... To see what they're up to...
@jeffmcnamee @barroomhero_dc @LizMair There was a time when if you said, "Make America Great Again" people would think they were supposed to get another job and work harder. Bozo has never worked in his life. Hard working immigrants just accentuate his oxymoronic tendencies
@samstein Should have taken advantage of that cheap Chinese steel, instead of putting tariffs on it!
@AmoneyResists @Tesscatbird @realDonaldTrump "dishonors your family" lol He doesn't have to curse; he dishonors his family, his country, and his Creator, with every deed.
@UncleSteveHarmn @ZoeTAlusa @TulsiGabbard @DNC @GOP The corruption will not be eliminated by those who are profiting from it. Abraham Lincoln was a Republican and every President since has been a Republican or Democrat. If both parties are corrupted, we have to move beyond the 2-party system to find solutions.
@chedlebb @alllibertynews @Brexit @libertarianism @MetroUK @BrexitCG Not bad, was hoping for a movie reference though - or something relating to clowns since only Bozo and Ronald McDonald look good with orange hair... maybe circusidal lunatic?
@john_sipher Maybe Mexico should build a wall to keep out Americans trying to save their families from the orange-crested lunatic. Or at least give us a net so we can catch fish in the Rio Grande
@realKaryotic @funder wait.. we don't need DHS after all.. aren't you on the Presidential Alert Network? I got a text message a few months ago assuring me that my president could warn me if there was anything important happening...
@Tesscatbird @funder Did you know that the FEC is shut down? I can't file my 2018 year-end campaign finance reports... well, I filed, but... might he try to remove candidates in 2020 for missing filings during the shutdown?
@WhiteRabbitMama @john_sipher @Alejand98015964 Shouldn't the shutdown stats be entered in the jobs report or the unemployment figures? Contractors will NOT receive back pay, shouldn't this make our economy look like shit, even to the mathematically challenged?
@brycetache @realDonaldTrump Instead of a "big, beautiful, wall" why not just put in a "Big River"?
@meanbobbymcgee @ScottBorg1 @TomSteyer "another" corrupt scumbag? lol The best way to ensure the President isn't forever indebted to wealthy corporate donors instead of the American People - elect one OF the American People. A "normal" one. https://t.co/WJ2w1lyKph
@marthadkirby @DearAuntCrabby @NBCPolitics Time is money. Information is money. The SUA is likely to be mostly bullshit and entertainment: no information and a waste of time. No one should watch or listen unless they are being PAID to - and I'll listen to their summaries in the morning!
@ProudResister @matthewjdowd @RashidaTlaib @realDonaldTrump Don't forget God / Allah / Science or whoever you believe created humanity and this nice planet we live on!
@BayardSheila @ReneeVoiceBrand @SethAbramson I suggest we put a relatively "normal" person in the White House, who is neither a Republican nor a Democrat. A standing promise to veto any party-line votes should eliminate partisanship in Congress. https://t.co/WJ2w1lyKph
@chedlebb @alllibertynews @Brexit @libertarianism @MetroUK @BrexitCG Hogwarts-on-Thames... so nice; can you think of something for the orange-crested buffoon across the pond?
@pizzmoe @El_Jammer @JulesVerne1981 @joshtpm We could fix this mess in one step - Elect a President in 2020 who is not a Republican or a Democrat. Take the party money out of the equation, and refuse to accept whatever billionaire, celebrity, or career politician they offer. https://t.co/WJ2w1lyKph
@globalerica @kenolin1 He might be trying to bankrupt the nation on purpose... https://t.co/bDT7fN7n0q
@SenJeffMerkley Thank you for trying to help. Even if maybe you should be in DC trying to fix the shutdown, I'd rather see you on the border investigating, than in Iowa campaigning for 2020... DURING the shutdown!
@SethAbramson Check this out - The FEC is shut down, and year-end campaign finance reports are due this month. Might the orange-crested buffoon keep it shut down longer in an attempt to derail potential 2020 competitors? Is Candidate Suppression a thing? Yet?
@ZoeTAlusa @UncleSteveHarmn @TulsiGabbard @DNC @GOP Doesn't matter who the candidate is - YES. This is a power struggle between the @GOP and @DNC, and they both believe the fight can be won by outspending their opponent. By the time a candidate has been chosen, he or she will already be corrupted by the party's money.
@jumpingraindrop @CwlsWinter I kept waiting for that clown to bust out laughing and say, "Just kidding guys, no one could be that stupid..." but I guess they are.. Thanks for trying to help, and nice to meet those included in this reply!
@CyrusMMcQueen Have you ever tried to sleep when squirrels have gotten into your attic?? Little claws scrabbling around on the drywall in the middle of the night DAH!!! Even cute animals should stay outside...
Just horsing around on the campaign trail... https://t.co/0Z3fioWDtf
@realDonaldTrump I need to file paperwork with the FEC so I can take your job away, but your shutdown is preventing me from filing on time. Can I get a presidential extension please?
@ZoeTAlusa @UncleSteveHarmn @TulsiGabbard @DNC @GOP The Presidential candidate of the @DNC will be taking boatloads of pac money.
@leslie774897519 @CwlsWinter @TrealDaisyDuke @jumpingraindrop @SenFeinstein @MSNBC The people who landed at Plymouth Rock were known as the Pilgrims. The European colonists (our ancestors) committed genocide, stole land and resources, and enslaved millions of humans. WE were the first illegal immigrants.
@leslie774897519 @TrealDaisyDuke @CwlsWinter @jumpingraindrop @SenFeinstein @MSNBC Just curious, which tribe do you belong to? The only legal residents of North America are Native Americans.
@UncleSteveHarmn @ZoeTAlusa @TulsiGabbard @DNC @GOP I love Tulsi, used to live down the beach from her, and by coincidence ran into her (literally, I was running) on Primary day. If she would run as an Independent, I would probably drop out and vote for her. But how much can she push back after accepting $1B in campaign donations?
@jessied44 @Anootchka @warmh20penguin @witliftin @HillaryClinton @DNC @GOP Abraham Lincoln was a Republican. Every President since has been a Republican or Democrat. You have never seen a serious 3rd party contest in your lifetime. Remember the definition of insanity? https://t.co/WJ2w1lyKph
Something no @GOP or @DNC candidate can claim #AskSteveRicheyAnything https://t.co/WJ2w1lyKph
@Anootchka @warmh20penguin @jessied44 @witliftin @HillaryClinton HRC for President - no problem. But I have trouble trusting any candidate  sponsored by the @DNC or @GOP - simply put, by the time a political  party has invested $1B in a Presidential candidate, their loyalty is now  to their party, NOT the American People who voted for them.
@reason Remember that $900 something Billion he signed several months ago for military spending? If that money had REALLY gone to the military, he wouldn't be able to make this latest claim. Bring home the troops, but find out who stole the money while you're at it!
@UncleSteveHarmn @ZoeTAlusa @TulsiGabbard Tulsi for President - no problem. But I have trouble trusting any candidate  sponsored by the @DNC or @GOP - simply put, by the time a political  party has invested $1B in a Presidential candidate, their loyalty is now  to their party, NOT the American People who voted for them.
@tenebrousoul @ReneeLibby2 @Brasilmagic @DanStirling3 Female President - no problem. But I have trouble trusting any candidate  sponsored by the @DNC or @GOP - simply put, by the time a political  party has invested $1B in a Presidential candidate, their loyalty is now  to their party, NOT the American People who voted for them.
@jumpingraindrop @TrealDaisyDuke @CwlsWinter @leslie774897519 @SenFeinstein @MSNBC It's too bad those words don't actually appear in any laws or policies. Considering the first settlers were welcomed by the natives... The USA was actually founded on genocide and slavery - would be nice if we could turn the humanitarian dial up to 11 to sort of catch up on karma
@SophiesMom64 If you know, please tell me. We don't seem to have a unilateral agreement other than the standard WTO plan, or if we DO have one, neither side is following it. Looks like a bar fight to me!
@leslie774897519 @TrealDaisyDuke @CwlsWinter @jumpingraindrop @SenFeinstein @MSNBC Using your own standards, you should be deported - at some point in your family tree, there is surely an illegal immigrant.
@CwlsWinter @leslie774897519 @TrealDaisyDuke @jumpingraindrop @SenFeinstein @MSNBC Oh, immigrants will destroy us all for sure - remember when that boatload of illegal immigrants landed at Plymouth Rock? The natives helped them survive the first few years, then those bastards killed them off, stole their land, and banished the survivors to "reservations"...
@brycetache @BetoORourke @amyklobuchar @KamalaHarris @TulsiGabbard There's nothing wrong with those candidates, the problem is the @DNC itself. If you take their money, you have to preach their gospel, and America just doesn't believe anymore. That's why most Americans stayed home in 2016. @HillaryClinton wins easily if she was Independent
@ewarren The @DNC will spend roughly $1B on the 2020 Presidential election. If you are elected, you will be on the hook for that investment, yet owe nothing to The People who voted for you. Empty promises buy votes, campaign contributions buy loyalty. Independent would be better.
@leslie774897519 @TrealDaisyDuke @CwlsWinter @jumpingraindrop @SenFeinstein @MSNBC If you declare it illegal to breathe, I will continue breathing.
@DogginTrump I spent the weekend in Hawaii, what's the problem??? lol
@Tennesseine The purpose of government is to secure our equal rights to Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. I have yet to see a billionaire, celebrity, or career politician who gives a shit about your rights or mine. The best President FOR the People is one OF the People
@TrealDaisyDuke @CwlsWinter @leslie774897519 @jumpingraindrop @SenFeinstein @MSNBC All men were created equal and have the right to Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. Governments were invented to protect those rights. Creating laws which deny basic human rights to any person is illegal. Your question assumes all laws are legitimate - they are not.
@EdKrassen Wrong. Consider what motivates our president. $$$ He hasn't figured out how HE can get rich with universal healthcare, so he's against it. He's afraid - of missing out on the scam!
@AlwaysActions This does not bother me at all. The 1st Amendment protects everyone equally, even when our government does not. #AskSteveRicheyAnything
@msbellows @brianschatz @ArrogantDemon I can think of some problems with your initial design plan - but there is a kernel of genius here and I'll probably steal it later without crediting you! #AskSteveRicheyAnything

Just pulled the UPS truck out of the mud on Christmas Eve: 38 billion Karma points for me!
@rubycramer One of the criteria for which candidates get invited is fundraising: not great ideas, not commitment to the American People, not compassion for the less fortunate... Fundraising. @dnc and @gop have that in common, they're just in it for the money
@DogginTrump Switch from coffee to tequila... Wait, are there tariffs on tequila? Can we still afford the good stuff?
@wendilee1 @tweettweetboom2 @RealJamesWoods Yes, exactly the same. Republicans and Democrats are getting rich by alternately stealing from the taxpayers and then blaming the other party. We need an Independent, Intelligent, and Incorruptible President.
@PennyRoo @RealJamesWoods I contend that any candidate who makes it to the top as a Republican OR a Democrat is already corrupted - elect an Independent, Intelligent, and Incorruptible President, and watch partisan politics disappear!
@justinamash @AC360 US Congress has declared war on no one in the Middle East. We don't know the difference between ISIS and every other resident of the region. Stop murdering civilians, end the War on Islam, bring our troops home, do it 15 years ago.

@debraj112 @lucid10808 @AynRandPaulRyan Exactly. No one should go to Washington DC expecting to get rich. Right now our elected officials are representing the donors who funded their campaigns, not the people who voted for them.
@zizzy_mcgirr @PhillisjSmith3 @realDonaldTrump I cannot believe how long it took for this to come out...
@debraj112 @lucid10808 @AynRandPaulRyan How to fix campaign finance law: elect an Independent President, who is self funded! The donors for the big parties will disappear instantly, if they ALL lose!
@TuenWasAMistake @AynRandPaulRyan @GOP @DNC If we keep "settling", there won't be anything left to fight for. There are plenty of Americans who would vote to break the two party system. It's not about political revenge, it's about protecting citizens' rights: that's a message every American can support.
@CeeJayT07381069 @NBCNews If we MUST have a Federal Reserve Bank (I'm not convinced) it MUST be independent of the Executive Branch. Especially when our president is a mafia-inspired bankruptcy clown. If our president is doing the will of the people he should be listening not talking. @alllibertynews
@TuenWasAMistake @AynRandPaulRyan @GOP @DNC Both parties plan to spend taxpayer money faster than the American People can earn it. Both parties will increase our national debt. Both parties will have our troops fighting illegal wars outside our borders. Both parties plan to get rich while driving America into bankruptcy.
@ResistTheTrump @danpfeiffer @CeeJayT07381069 Always happy to learn: What's the largest concept about national debt that I don't seem to understand?
@thekohler @AynRandPaulRyan The Constitution was written by people who warned of the dangers posed by large political parties - We were supposed to learn from the mistakes made in Europe. The easy fix is to elect an Independent President to de-polarize Congress
@briancheeek @AynRandPaulRyan Consider that the first illegal immigrants arrived on the Mayflower... Can we deport Nationalists after declaring them all "anchor babies"? Governments were created to protect the rights of people, not to make the "nation" great by excluding immigrants!
@TuenWasAMistake @AynRandPaulRyan @GOP and @DNC spent a billion dollars each trying to convince America that THEIR candidate was the best. I don't care WHO it is, if they run as a Democrat or a Republican they have already been corrupted by the money.
@lucid10808 @debraj112 @AynRandPaulRyan Correct, what we call a "broken system" is exactly how they make their money - they won't fix it because they're getting rich with "business as usual". I'm trying to take money out of the equation!
@ResistTheTrump @danpfeiffer @CeeJayT07381069 You can't be Independent or Incorruptible when your political party spends $1B to put you in the race. And if our National Debt isn't a problem for you, it's only because you haven't been asked to pay your share back yet! Currently $66K PER CITIZEN, can you write a check?
@george_capen What if we just never say his name again... forever... I've already started!
@OMGno2trump The orange-crested buffoon is not the problem - he is the RESULT of the problem - any president elected by the @GOP or @DNC is already corrupted and will be representing party donors, not the American People. Independent, Intelligent, Incorruptible - the only logical choice
@LongbowMkII @jgownder @AynRandPaulRyan The last President to add LESS than $1T to the national debt was Jimmy Carter. The last President who refused to fight illegal wars overseas - not in the last 100 years. Borrowing money from the American People to fight illegal wars overseas is how @GOP and @DNC operate.
@jgownder @AynRandPaulRyan The rich who control our government will use every available tactic to remain in control - running highly sponsored/corrupted candidates that no intelligent human could vote for is just one strategy. Break the chain at the top, and all the links will fall off.
@ChandaFinch @xkfngs @AynRandPaulRyan I happily shit on any political party that spends $1B trying to convince the American People that the Billionaire/Celebrity/Career Politician they have selected will work hard in the best interests of the American People. @GOP and @DNC are the same.
@JordanUhl Done Deal - would you like to be killed IN Mueller's office or should we drag your carcass in from the back alley?
@DogginTrump By the time @DNC has spent a billion dollars choosing their candidate, it will be too late to realize this is exactly why the American People cannot trust their candidate.
@leeleeb50 Democrat, Republican... What's the difference? The national debt will go up, illegal wars will be fought - your political party does not have the best interests of the American People in mind. Please put yourself, and all of us, ahead of your political party!
@danpfeiffer @CeeJayT07381069 Doesn't matter who the Republicans and Democrats run: the national debt will go up, and our military will remain spread across the globe fighting illegal wars. It's time for a change: we need an Independent, Intelligent, and Incorruptible President.
@TIME @emilyjodell Question: Why the Hell are you running for President? Answer: Because I don't trust the Billionaires, Celebrities, and career Politicians the Republicans and Democrats will offer us in 2020, to "fix" the corruption that enriched them in the first place!
@StevenTDennis If our next President is a Republican or a Democrat, our national debt will go up and we will continue to fight illegal wars around the globe. Let's try something different, let's do something good for the American People this time!
@CIAspygirl According to the Declaration of Independence, governments are created to protect the rights of the People, and, failing that, the People have the right to alter or abolish the government. It's time to alter or abolish!

@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump For what it's worth I decline as well! Who wants to be acting CoS for someone acting (poorly) like a president?

@siano2020 Many of our current political problems stem from our patriarchy-based system - Nothing will change until we change it, and everything above sounds just fine to me!
@AynRandPaulRyan Quick question - if Democrats have solutions that work for ALL Americans, why haven't we all joined already? We've been playing this 2-party game for far too long, giving us equally terrible choices between Republicans and Democrats is why most Americans don't bother to vote.
@PeterSchiff And why are we still borrowing money to keep our government afloat...? Sounds like someone is bankrupting us on purpose.... https://t.co/bDT7fN7n0q
@Jim_Jordan So gassing women and children is your attempt at "being like Israel"? Israel would have just shot them... There is no threat, Americans are not afraid of refugees, and you, coward, will not get a wall unless you build it yourself!
@Tru7hS33kR Why can't someone just call him a liar to his face? Is that illegal or something? Can the next on-camera interview be done in an octagon? I'll bet @NancyPelosi could take him down in about 20 seconds!
@MuslimIQ Those must be the "10 terrorists" that were caught recently sneaking into our country. His convoluted lies always start with something true! Build the Wall - around his stupid Tower, with him inside!
@ProudResister And when he tells you our economy is "Booming" but we're running on a trillion dollar deficit - that means his rich buddies are getting all the money and we're bankrupt!
@NPR Let's face it: our president is an idiot. If we all did things his way the Earth would have exploded already. Intelligence will progress without him, as will the rest of humanity.
@NPRinskeep @WarrenDavidson @MorningEdition Are all people created equal with the Right to Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness; or do Human Rights differ based on where you chose to be born? BTW WE DON'T CHOOSE THE PLACE OF OUR OWN BIRTH!! @ACLU @acluhawaii @splcenter
@AEMahrakawy I was thinking bankruptcy, with our president absconding to Siberia with a plane load of worthless USdollars. If you still have money in his touted stock market, you're in trouble!

@The_ZachDaniels @JesMazur @DJGoldenVoice @Gekyumey @felix_brody @Vote16MA Maybe the inverse - no one above age X should run for office? Too easy to make bad decisions if you know you're going to die before the consequences come...

@krassenstein If our economy is "Great", why the Hell are we cutting taxes and borrowing from the Chinese to support illegal wars in the Middle East? What clown is in charge of this circus? And why is a clown running the circus, what happened to the ringmaster? #AskSteveRicheyAnything

@frederickhiller @george_capen @birdyyodas @SerenityFoods If he wants to keep the forest safe, he should lay down in front of someone's house as sort of a fat ass firebreak!
@DogginTrump Please specify: quantity, quality, or putridessence of garbage... Or just give him the damned trophy already!
@mccvic @stl_2004 @CTO1ChipNagel Just in time for the Holidays... So much to be thankful for!
@VeroPink92311 @booksanescape @TitusNation @CTO1ChipNagel Too late now, even if he cancels the tariffs, why would they buy from us again? This must be what winning too much looks like..
@stucam7771 Consider that EVERYTHING he has done increased the national debt by 5X what it should have cost, NO, he's been nothing but a fat ass liability
@paglia_ng @WarMo33 @Jeannej67470748 @Acosta @SoCalJoy If any MAGA supporters lost their homes, imagine their disappointment when he showed up in California without the handfuls of cash they were expecting! Make America Rake Again!
@mgtex @BelsonElaine @TheRickWilson No way he could be reelected, and I'm sure his party knows this. Closed door meeting, one year from now, he resigns within a week citing unfair treatment by the media. Then vanishes to Russia before indictment. Mark your calendars!
@PhyllisSilver @mkraju @realDonaldTrump Some say Country over Party, he says ME ME ME ME! Doesn't know or care what party Mueller belongs to, just trying to avoid prosecution!
@wtf_imtooold @mkraju He is beyond fact checking, isn't he? Has our president been confirmed by the Senate? Can they try again?
@redlipsstudio2 @SMTRE24 @GrassrootsSpeak @LyndaSStuart1 @BrianKempGA You understand this is all your fault, right? Illegal immigrants voting in Georgia broke your made in China rake, you should have built a wall and placed tariffs on fires coming into California!
@Buckeye_in_Va @Seattie @WeAretheMedia2 @stucam7771 Everything he touches dies... Or burns... Or gets arrested... Is that considered a "skill"?
@stucam7771 If you think our president is a fucking moron, can you imagine the dozens of Americans who lost their homes and thought he was coming to California to HELP them?
@winedesignlove @JamilSmith Watch for a closed door meeting about a year from now, he'll resign within a week citing unfair treatment.
I can take a few more rake puns.... https://t.co/yKF1ZiCP8i
@JamilSmith Think about it, he has not GAINED a supporter since the election, but has lost millions... When the @gop figures that out, they will have no choice but to run a different candidate in 2020!
@ImKaylaG Wait, wasn't it @gop who decided to dump NAFTA and didn't @GOP actually WRITE the new one? It's not like they can blame the orange crested buffoon for that, he can't read or write!
@Boba_Tea_Catan @brycetache Remember that part in the presidential oath of office where he promised to uphold the Constitution? He probably doesn't remember that at all....
@DanRather @MichaelEMann Or every other dictator wanna be on the globe!
@OutlierShME @itsJeffTiedrich That same band of rain extends all the way to Hawaii where helicopters are grounded golf courses are closed and Twitter isn't working - recommend all orange haired ass clowns head back East to the home swamp
@ColMorrisDavis @realDonaldTrump The Daniel Boone National Forest was my backyard - we never raked or cleaned up or "did stuff"(?) That's what the forest fires do! Has this city-slicker moron ever BEEN in a forest? He ain't got a lick of sense, does he?
@SarahDurossette @davidmweissman She's MARRIED to a fucking idiot AND a fucking liar! No incest jokes, it's the same guy!
@NorquistNemesis @JackMc185 @ColMorrisDavis @realDonaldTrump Oxymoron
@itsJeffTiedrich @FibonacciNum @EmmaKennedy Sorry, we don't play golf in Hawaii and it's raining so helicopters don't work and there's no Twitter here... (Hope that works!)
@DrugstorCowboy @bill_haber @Buckleup36 @TheMattBass @ArtWillard @MollyJongFast @kylegriffin1 @VP made his deal with the devil long ago, trust me, he's loyal! (Maybe not to you, though!)

@TheFactRant @SafiMaasai @soccerlives1127 @ljburns @mommamia1217 @KelliCrackel Since women do 100% of the work bearing and raising kids... No man can judge them. Besides, no one ever PLANNED to have an abortion, it's easy to object until the choice is yours!
@atDavidHoffman @TedAtz If @Acosta is asked to stop by the Saudi embassy to pick up his ID... Probably a bad idea, dude!
@capseyes_cappy @Rudraflo @JamesSNYC @PhilipRucker I heard him say "of course you have to have lawyers go over the answers" so there's his out - go over means rewrite, yes?
@riotwomennn @ananavarro Did you stop the video just before that dude got bitch slapped? It was coming! Soon!
@DogginTrump It's pouring in Hawaii, stay away from us too! Seriously though, California needs a good soaking, please, rain gods?
@Alisonrasheed @WishIwasSpock @markwaters84 @tealBleeder @PoLitaKaLLisa @julystorm0829 @Ali_H_Soufan The USA produces enough oil for its own needs, especially if we ban the internal combustion engine. We don't need to be attacking anyone in the Middle East, they will never convert to a Christian democracy. Why do we have to sell our souls to do business with the Saudis?
@CMCRET Nothing a highly trained professional loves more than being "logistical support"!
@TheDweck @BobB6345789 Please don't insult all the passive aggressives, we don't know that shithead
@AshaRangappa_ I tried to vote again, disguised as Asha, but I was in the hair salon 16 hours and polls were closed when I got out!
@crymeariver6666 @teestark They're just holding their noses and waiting for president pence... They made a deal with the devil, and they intend to keep it!
Can you imagine how much damage he could do if he were INTELLIGENT? 😱
@DavidCornDC He didn't let his emotions run the country, so... Never!
@bjcreigh @restaurant_mom Sadly, math, reading, and writing, were all too challenging for him - he even paid a classmate to go to recess in his place, the effects are still obvious today!
@bjcreigh @restaurant_mom He went there to see Pootie and used Armistice Day as cover, so stupid he can't figure out how he got busted
@AP_Politics Close the base, our president says the threat is over!
@AP_Politics If I can travel to Cuba legally, how will the orange crested buffoon stop me from visiting stuff?
@ReneeLibby2 He's too old and he's like this every day... Male menopause for sure!
Asking us to choose between 2 terrible candidates with equally terrible platforms is voter suppression.
@DogginTrump Realize that the candidate is not important, the @GOP and @DNC are colluding to defraud the American People. Asking us to choose between 2 terrible candidates is voter suppression.
@linmp1031 @LALewman @thehill You are only as great as the least among you - how you treat the homeless is indicative of your true nature.
@black4life21 @bretplate @JohnJHarwood Life moves forward, only. When the odds are stacked in your favor, but the "others" are chipping away at your lead, you will look at history and desire to return to a time when your advantage was greatest. It won't work - we're moving forward without you.
@mehdirhasan @wtfdoicare33 Don't be modest.. this is awesome - quite disgusting actually - yet somehow awesome!
@katherinegehl Just heard your interview on Freakonomics Radio and discovered we're working on parallel projects - I have some insights to share and some questions as well, please contact me at SteveRicheyForPresident2020@gmail.com
@Freakonomics thanks for explaining significant portions of my campaign strategy on tonight's radio program. I'm not mad, but I will be stealing some of your material!
@NicolleDWallace @BobB6345789 He didn't want to inconvenience the good citizens of Paris, and all the unwanted attention he would be getting!
@jeremyherb @mkraju @JDiamond1 @KateBennett_DC What, did she have an affair with the president? How did that even get on Mel's radar?
@BenjySarlin I still follow him, because it's useful to know what he's thinking, but I will never comment, like, or say his name again. Never! Even if he doesn't notice, I am proud to have done my part to piss him off!
@funder Didn't we agree last week things couldn't get any worse?
@ListenToEzra Can you imagine the dumpster of deplorables he'll be dragging around in 2020?
@TheRickWilson They assumed their boy in the oval office would be able to revoke women's suffrage by executive order before the midterm, but he was busy golfing
@girlsreallyrule @BobB6345789 A very small and ignorant part of her supporters are proud of her for not waffling on this issue!
@funder @PressSec Not clear on your true opinion of the lying bag of shit, could you be more specific please?
@TeaPainUSA Ok, Rembrandt, thanks for painting a mental picture that's likely to give me nightmares! Why does he have to piss in the diet Coke cans, don't they make plus size adult diapers?
@MagicalMerlin50 @sarahjo50962074 @AskewViewNews @Brasilmagic I was going to question this story from the UK, but anything that lying freak @PressSec says is simply wrong, so let's run with it! Go to Hell, if they'll have you!
@kairyssdal Bought new running shoes yesterday, they cost $10 more on the company website, but I didn't join Prime yet! 😛
@MillenPolitics Keep up the good work, this nation will always be moving forward, not backward, and nobody knows that more than the younger generation!
@letsyapwithcap @AdamSchiff @kathieallenmd Would be nice if we could ban lobbyists all together, since NONE of them are representing the voters! I appreciate your efforts, Mr Schiff!

@HLucibello @NUCKLLEDRAGER @AAEC40088110 @BRSMatthew @GenMhayden @SteveSchmidtSES @TheRickWilson @BarackObama That dude would kick our president's ass into next week!
@AllCharisma @_georgekaplan @eclecticbrotha What does he care about the stock market? He's invested his future with his BFF Pootie and his buddy SOB (sp?) from Saudi Arabia
@MyPresidentme @trump_sucks357 @adamsmithtimes @jaketapper The same law creating the deadline must create a resolution if the deadline is missed. No court will uphold an administrative forfeit.
@PersuasivePR @Lee_in_Iowa I have a CDL, give me the keys to that bus!
@ellievan65 It's harvest season, and our biggest customer has been tariffed out of the market - next spring when the farmers are bankrupt, is that the Democrat's fault also?
@selectedwisdom @oufenix I hope everyone visiting Arlington Cemetery today appreciated the peace, dignity, and solemn respect that a presidential motorcade would have certainly destroyed
@DonaldTrumpWall @scribler2 @FrankLuntz @GOP Polls are just like elections: if not enough people participate, you get an orange crested buffoon in the White House.
@Lee_in_Iowa Don't invest your money in risky internet ventures, invest in the USA, where it will be reliably stolen by your own government!
@Carolin65703265 @beastiegirl1969 @MsDixieDiva8253 @Bygone1 @mr_oogy_boogy @ommagagga @SBarolet @KenDilanianNBC @annaschecter Looks like Merkel has a gun in Macron's back and is saying GET HIM! That smile on Bozo is damned creepy - and Melania doesn't seem to be aware of... anything.... Beautiful photo, real or fake I don't care!
@DearAuntCrabby No thank you - but I'll buy you that drink!
@speculawyer @sahilkapur It's a shame we have to fight so hard against our own government to achieve fair representation - I am extremely encouraged to see so many women and minorities getting into the game. Old White Men aren't getting us anywhere!
@DavidNeiwert @EricKleefeld @joshtpm See? Intelligent people discussing something on Twitter - no name calling or derogatory insults - why do our president and his supporters think Twitter is some sort of octagon? (Hint: I said Intelligent)
@Conscience4 @dancetoACJ @BASRJIM @ALJWS @AP_Politics @AP Don't forget how much it hurt, and don't ever let it happen again. Every state, every city, every American, must keep fighting because WE ARE NOT DONE YET! The American People make up this nation, and it is the People that must be served!
@MuslimIQ Where the Hell did this guy park? Wouldn't it be more fitting for his cowardly agenda to rant at them from his piece of shit car? Oh, is that his truck way over there? Afraid to let anyone see his license plates I guess! BTW Jesus loved everyone, that was kinda the whole idea
@MarkHertling The Good News: Those Patriots who wish to visit Arlington Cemetery may do so without fear of having the peace and solitude interrupted by the presidential motorcade and air support.
@JoyAnnReid Dumbest tweet ever - If a person could apply for asylum from the comfort of their own home, they don't NEED asylum. At least @SenTomCotton has proven that he has the ability to be as dumb as our president - most of us couldn't do that!
@SafetyPinDaily The hookers must be terrible, if he can't even remember!
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Sorry, 38% is not yet BOOM - because THEY will all vote and if the rest of America can be intimidated into staying home, the orange-crested buffoon gets 4 more years and we're not likely to survive as a nation.
@DogginTrump Before I said those words, I would be on my way to a 3rd world country without extradition treaties - no matter how much money you've stolen, they're going to take it ALL, you know? Stupid criminals with no escape plan...
@joshscampbell @realDonaldTrump He has a natural aversion to firefighters, it's either: 1. he wants to be a hero, but he's a chicken-shit coward, or 2. he has the mindset of a Constitutional Arsonist. Just two more years, folks...
@EdKrassen I hope he's watching Monday Night Football - National Anthem done proud by a member of our military - do you think he even stands up? Or does he just snap his fingers for another diet Coke...
@LisaMascaro She does know that her Supreme Leader doesn't appreciate females with opinions, right?
now THAT was a National Anthem!! #MNF
@jenykookoo @GenMhayden Wait, you have a "not dumb" button? Not fair!
@mkraju @joshscampbell That's what sucks about nationalism: you know you're about to be arrested but you don't have any friends in obscure, third world countries, without extradition treaties... Have fun in jail!
@RepAdamSchiff Where in the Constitution does the president get the power to decide election results?
@BreakingNLive @nickgillespie Good thing he wasn't a black female journalist, so he only got a glare...
@krassenstein The fat guy in the White House basement who runs all his polls thinks Gallup is full of shit!
@MarkWarner He neither cares about nor can spell integrity, election or otherwise
@GrassrootsSpeak Hahaha legitimate question about illegitimate president... Oxymoron
@EdKrassen @sbaker209 You're going soft, Ed. Just change the date and this could be any day since the inauguration
@LPNational @Liberty13Texas Seriously? Who would vote for "Peace and Freedom" when every day our president is ranting about immigrants stealing our jobs and spending trillions sending our military all over the globe? This is a FIGHT, we will never win with ambiguous slogans! #AskSteveRicheyAnything
@rachaelmbade @WSJ The only party which can't be held responsible for the national debt is the Libertarians. So let's put a Libertarian in the White House - give Congress something to be bipartisan about!
@NUCKLLEDRAGER @AAEC40088110 @BRSMatthew @GenMhayden @SteveSchmidtSES @TheRickWilson @BarackObama Contracting pneumonia while paying tribute to American fallen heroes was the ONE CHANCE he had to die a hero himself. Now he'll be just be a racist traitor forever.
@MalcolmNance Truth as poetry.
@SenTomCotton Your ignorance astounds me, sir, and could not possibly be corrected within the confines of a tweet. Your 6th grade teacher called, they want their diploma back...
@MacronInEnglish @EmmanuelMacron On behalf of many Americans, thank you for honoring our countrymen who fought and died so far from home. Thank you as well for speaking intelligently and honestly to our president. Our nations' friendship will outlast the plots of our enemies.
@brianstelter @ReliableSources Why quibble about Constitutionality when our president doesn't CARE about it - he's in Paris, just change the locks on the White House and pretend he's just some drunk who showed up...
@VicenteFoxQue @realDonaldTrump Macron speaks English much better than our president - but why bother? He doesn't listen to anyone but Pootie...
@shossy2 Anyone who failed to stand up to him is complicit. Don't forget that either! And add the orange crested buffoon to the shitlist, please!
@Kokomothegreat He never explained why he was going to court tomorrow...
@RepSwalwell Acting like he was going for Armistice Day got the American People to pay for the BFF Pootie meetup. Suckers!
@DrDenaGrayson She's so damned good at her job! Spokesperson for the Liar in Chief is something most of us couldn't handle!
@GenMhayden He probably thought Macron was talking about hookers... Oui oui on the bed, please!
@SassyKadiK They don't have L'Uber?
@funder A disaster paid for by US! Can we at least bill him for the jet fuel to haul his fat ass across the Atlantic?
@bluestein @JohnJHarwood @BrianKempGA @staceyabrams I'll bet he doesn't demand SHIT when he's within her reach! She might give him the licking he deserves!
@brianschatz @wtfdoicare33 He won't return my calls either, maybe I shouldn't have slept with his wife!
@TheEconomist Simple solution: put a Libertarian in the White House, so Congress has something to unify over. Also, no finger pointing or revenge because Libertarians caused NONE of the problems cited below
@CREWcrew @wtfdoicare33 He'll probably say there are"good people on both sides" of his cell block
@JohnKerry @Fuzzy_Fuzzbutt @realDonaldTrump Think: the rain was a convenient excuse, he never cared about visiting that cemetery! He went there to see his BFF Pootie!
@NatashaBertrand @wtfdoicare33 Never forget to represent the American People. Because if you forget, they WILL vote you out! Congratulations and thank you for your hard work!
@Kokomothegreat So there's time for me to move to Florida and vote for @AndrewGillum ?
@RichardDawkins Here's what's on my nightstand... Just saying... https://t.co/7eMrOBTnJm
@linmp1031 @RealNastyWoman @kiwi_newz @persisting2017 @Oldyella49 @DrDenaGrayson @Pathfinder1001 @realDonaldTrump Smack that ass next time, Pootie! When you're a STAR they LET you do it!
@DogginTrump Nobody like, retweet or comment. Nothing. Follow, so he KNOWS we're there... after he announces his boycott of unfair Twitter, we go back to laughing at him again
@CharMac50 @mdnyttokr @nightwingilovey @RKJ65 @realDonaldTrump He's gonna get punched out soon, it's coming...
@RKJ65 @realDonaldTrump Special prosecutors? Undiscovered bastard children? The sound of crickets?
@SafetyPinDaily Old white men have proven themselves unworthy, let's give women and minorities a turn for the next 100 years!
Last warm-up: Honolulu Marathon is in 4 weeks! Boca / Val Nolasco Half Marathon https://t.co/T6DaaSLXAk
@amvetsupport He didn't go to Paris to visit the cemetery, he used our fallen heroes to get us to PAY for his trip
@lillybelle50 @Tanker_wfe4life @celina_curry @MustangZeroFive @AshaRangappa_ @mattgaetz It says "drink responsibly" on the bottom of most beer bottles, but after the first 10 - 15 bottles it's kinda hard to read
@Kokomothegreat @realDonaldTrump I would like to hand him a shovel and see if he can figure out which end goes in his ass
@FestusKrampp @Kokomothegreat @HillBeverlyhill @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @PressSec @KellyannePolls @MattWhitaker46 Some say they're trying to "protect America" but I don't buy it. If the entire White House staff just walked away, he would be neutered, yes?
@DogginTrump He used Armistice Day as an excuse so WE would pay for his trip. He used the rain as an excuse because THAT'S NOT WHY HE WENT THERE! We got suckered again
@mattmfm Step back, clear your mind, analyze: obviously this ceremony is not why he went there, it's just how he tricked US into paying for the trip!
@TeaPainUSA @TeaPain4 But... Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery... Unless someone dresses as YOU for Halloween, that's just creepy!
@BlaineWHardaway Congratulations! I appreciate your efforts to use your powers for GOOD!
@RepAdamSchiff Forest fires occur naturally, it's part of nature's cycle. The reason they are worse NOW is twofold: we put out the fires before they can clear the underbrush, and we keep building houses in fire prone areas. It's more of an education issue than management deficiency
@Kokomothegreat @KapeicaResists He was talking about hookers, you misunderstood
@atrupar @FoxNews I respect Fox more on the days I don't hear from them... It's been good for me so far...
@JThomasMadden1 @LouisatheLast @georgelittledc Hopefully he's trying to save America by sacrificing his own professional standards and sanity
@Kittytyme @Walied @john_sipher @georgelittledc @MaxBoot He was probably expecting the cemetery to be more like a stadium, with a retractable roof. He was disappointed to find out it was outside...
@perlmutations @KapeicaResists You can't UNread THAT thread!
@MarkHertling Leadership - defined above. Not to be confused with WTF in the oval office
@ananavarro If you've ever laughed at a French, German, or Canadian joke: just imagine how hard they're laughing at US right now! Can Americans claim asylum in other countries because we're embarrassed about our Dumbass in Chief?
@KRemainechau @waltb31 @SarahBCalif @realDonaldTrump Maybe he'll try to impress his BFF with his umbrella folding routine!
@Jan_L_F @denkayem @Joelsberg @JoyAnnReid @Lawrence Yet, no matter how ignorant or untruthful he is, no one has the balls to call him out! He needs a good bitch slapping!!
@Sybil_Virginia @Leahruns100 @lynnebmurray @JacmKaz @JoyAnnReid The participants in this thread should be in charge of this country - more was accomplished in 2 minutes than Dipshit in Chief could ever do...
@colvinj Because they're disposable? Just give to the orange crested buffoon the keys to a chopper, evacuate surrounding cities, and tell him, "Obama can fly a chopper to the cemetery...."
@MollyJongFast @joshtpm WTF is that, a pothole selfie?
@CarolLeonnig @realDonaldTrump Maybe our president's overlords will run out of uses for HIM and let Mueller have his way with him!
@ProudResister @realDonaldTrump He's afraid of unarmed refugees and military service, water falling from the sky must really trip him out!
@juliaioffe @dana1981 He's a racist and a coward, visiting the cemetery would go against his most deeply held beliefs
@DanteUSAInferno Nationalism is the cover story Hitler used to convince Germans it was okay to kill Jews: ironically they were also Germans. So which of us Americans does our president think it's okay to exterminate?
@SamDono10307721 @iamLisaHunt @DahlELama2 @TheRynheart @InSpiteOfTrump @LindseyGrahamSC @DeadlineWH @chucktodd @Lawrence @KatyTurNBC @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @VP @mmpadellan @subsalr @DrDenaGrayson @ProudResister @DemWrite @kylegriffin1 @funder @ninaandtito @votebluealways @LincolnsBible @adamcbest Would one person in Washington DC grow a pair of balls and stand up for the American People the way we ELECTED you to? Sorry, @LindseyGrahamSC, yours are in the oval office in a jar
@votevets Send your wife to Egypt - $95,000 	Sex with a porn star - $130,000 	Integrity - not for sale	Control the weather - you could ask God, but he's already forgotten about you.	Some things are just out of your reach...
@liliefleur @roywlewis @Mastermind7864 @jerseygirlmay23 I'll bet he sells his family down the river if things get tight...
@OutlierShME @Melissa_Downing @maddow Surely, even he, would be too smart to do that... But if I ever have the chance I'll bait him for sure, I won't even hit him back!
@CharlesMBlow @MichaelAaron64 Shhhhh, of course you are absolutely correct but if you stay this course the @GOP might realize their only chance to win in 2020 is to kick him to the curb... Just let them think they're still "winning"
@marjorieh1350 @maddow Wait until he loses in the @GOP PRIMARY in 2020... The whining will be "unlike anything we've seen before"
@lulu_says2 @maddow I hate him because he's making life difficult for white men who DON'T hate black women! Too bad no one in his cabinet has the balls to bitch slap him like he deserves!
@RoyWooStev @JudithDimitrov @maddow I think you're right, where are his kids right now? If the whole klan is out of the country at the same time, it might be a defection!
@OutlierShME @Melissa_Downing @maddow Does it seem like just after the midterm election, he was let off his leash a little? He's more violent than last week I think
@goofrider @IreneRoeder @maddow I bet he has several illegitimate children with black women, and every time he sees one he's afraid he's about to be served with paternity papers
@McFaul They are still unarmed and have stopped to rest in Mexico City as many are exhausted and malnourished. No one seems to care now that Coward in Chief is no longer crying about them
@RealMotherMary @hiinoreii @sitnspinster @American_Issue @ugaswimmerbr1 @realDeeMac @tgonzo07 @Sarah_SKG_1983 @LindseyGrahamSC A little blackmail can undermine a whole lot of integrity
@AshaRangappa_ Can we move on to a new president? Now?
@MichaelAaron64 @realDonaldTrump I just look to see if his lips are moving
@PassTheSalty Normally I am against the death penalty, but I could make an exception... We can discuss constitutionality later ;)
@funder @debbiesideris @realDonaldTrump Or jump out of Air Force One in a reenactment of some famous battle - but no parachute, think of yourself as a blubber filled barrel bomb
@RBReich Corruption trickles down, so don't expect things to improve until we change the guy at the top...
@Ali_H_Soufan If our president was Senate confirmed, why are senators allowed to come to work high?
@leeleeb50 All he knows is it's not February 29th, that's the day he has to have sex with his WIFE!
@timmyturmoil Yes, you're a terrible person! I had that fantasy first!
@DearAuntCrabby Never vote for a billionaire, celebrity, or career politician
Any small business owner can tell you, if you piss off a customer and they start buying from someone else... They won't come back just because you say "sorry". Our president doesn't seem to know much about business!
@tribble09 @EndtheWaronDru2 @Forbes When your entire agenda is racist and fear based, your tactics tend to be unseemly
@Ironhorse76 @EndtheWaronDru2 You're safe, he can't read!
@Dracogen @CheriJacobus @ALJWS Shame related spontaneous combustion... Wish that was real! But after Washington DC burns down, where will the next capitol be?
@maxvan00 @alllibertynews @justinamash @RepTimRyan Bipartisan thinking got us to where we are now. We could use some nonpartisan intelligence in Washington DC. Decisions made by any partisan are always suspect.
@ANTITRUMPMVMT @davidmweissman Would have cost less if he just got a hooker for the night...
@DearAuntCrabby Maybe he lies all the time so when we finally see his tax returns it won't seem so shocking... I bet $5 he hasn't paid any for a very long time... Probably gets a refund too!
@LindseyGrahamSC You used to be respectable when you asked our president to follow the law, but now that you've joined the dark side no one will ever respect you again. No one is above the law
@joshscampbell Our next president will have to at least fumigate, at worst demolish the White House... That's the respect HE shows!
@Rhall151Hall @Jackelope64 @amervoices Wait I thought "law and order" was just a campaign slogan! You thought I was serious?
@jeremyherb @LauraAJarrett Wait, isn't he just babysitting? Why does he have to do a good job, isn't he just supposed to keep the office from falling apart?
@AshaRangappa_ Does the Senate confirm the president? Is alcohol still allowed on the Senate floor?
@mkraju @teestark I hope he never gets the idiotic idea in his head that ANYONE really respects HIM!
@GregoryB16 @Diana040893 @DearAuntCrabby @realDonaldTrump She's probably angry at the AMOUNTS of money the other women got it though...
@TheBeatWithAri I used to respect him, but I can't tolerate political suck-ups so it's over, @LindseyGrahamSC
@Jonee61 @joshscampbell Maybe they'll share a cell later, so they can get better acquainted...
@jwheels74 Anyone have the balls to call out the Racist in Chief? Okay, I'll do it! It's not that black people think he's racist, I'm white and I KNOW he's racist! @GOP says what? Nothing....
@joshscampbell You didn't think any of this was a coincidence, did you?
@schwartzbCNBC Remember in his campaign he said he wouldn't broadcast his every move to the world, like Obama? He just can't shut up, can he?
@thefakecarmona You could cover it with a Ted Cruz sticker but then people would think you were a lying racist!
@JoyAnnReid If no one is going to stand up to him, what message does that send to his racist supporters? Put me in the same room with him, I can fix this!

@JoycejohnsonR @CasablancaRic @counterchekist Joyce, I have to wonder - if either Republicans or Democrats had the formula to make the prosperity of the American People the focus of our government: wouldn't we all have joined already?

@scout_nj @HuffPostPol @maziehirono @GOP @Scotus The Duopoly (Republicans and Democrats) have divided and conquered America, taking as much as they can for themselves and blaming the other for whatever goes wrong. We need representatives of NORMAL Americans in Washington DC, and that's why I'm running for President.
@scout_nj @HuffPostPol @maziehirono @GOP @Scotus One of my favorite documents is the Declaration of Independence - when you hold that up next to our current regime - it's shocking! We've come full-circle back to where we were, or WORSE.
@scout_nj @HuffPostPol @maziehirono @GOP @Scotus Sorry, I'm not good with labels - "activist judges" sounds wretched - I think the problem with the whole system is how far we've strayed from the Constitution. Our Founding Fathers didn't have internet or TV, so they had time to read and think - nobody does that anymore!

@Fuelie327 @RabbiChavaBahle @lori_bussell @glenn87027633 @eSEy_Bee In religion, just like politics, the radicals will always be at odds with the rest of civilization.

@scout_nj @HuffPostPol @maziehirono @GOP Both parties are encouraging division in America, what we need is solutions that work for everyone. Divide and conquer is what you do to your enemies, not your own country. Stacking @Scotus leads to further division and is detrimental to the interests of the American People.
@scout_nj @HuffPostPol @maziehirono When Scalia died, @GOP refused to even interview Garland, nominated March 16, 2016 "because of the impending election". Kennedy announces retirement June 27, 2018, and they will hear nothing less than confirmation BEFORE the election. continued...

@OutlierShME @Shayda1112 @GrandmasWeb @SenJeffMerkley @shellshocked103 @realDonaldTrump I think China would love to expand to the Central Pacific - Hawaii with all military bases included - couple $Trillion?
@OutlierShME @Shayda1112 @GrandmasWeb @SenJeffMerkley @shellshocked103 @realDonaldTrump Here's a scenario I dreamed up last month... https://t.co/bDT7fN7n0q
@OutlierShME @Shayda1112 @GrandmasWeb @SenJeffMerkley @shellshocked103 @realDonaldTrump Immigration, trade, military, deficit: all fit the model of a nation attempting to destroy itself. It's unimaginable, but I believe our President is trying to destroy the USA. How does he plan to profit from this? Sell the USA to China and run away to Russia?
@OutlierShME @Shayda1112 @GrandmasWeb @SenJeffMerkley @shellshocked103 @realDonaldTrump Exactly - Solutions, I believe, involve helping People - You can't throw money at a problem and hope it goes away. Food and medicine solve short-term problems, education provides self-sufficiency for the long term. #AskSteveRicheyAnything

@IanMMcC Question - my total ignorance of Iceland assumed - Do they have lots of rules and regulations for EVERYTHING or do they swing more Libertarian? I'm guessing movement toward the Libertarian model must happen as population sample increases, otherwise you end up Communist, right?

@Kenlar333 @opposingliars @EbonyGorilla @SpicolisPool @CantTeachTrump @WhiteHouse @SteveScalise @GOP Ken, if the President is acting against the secure and sustainable future of the People, the only people who stand WITH him are his co-conspirators.
@Kenlar333 @opposingliars @EbonyGorilla @SpicolisPool @CantTeachTrump @WhiteHouse @SteveScalise @GOP Convincing the people of a nation that they can "Make the Nation Great" by ceding total control to their leader was exactly Hitler's message. It fails ideologically, because the people ARE the nation, and you can't make the nation Great while leaving the people behind!
@Jonesnforthetr1 @SicTransit34 @77Fahrenheit @JohnJHarwood @POTUS Blinded by ignorance and fear - which describes most of America's foreign policy at this point.

@mwekow100 @GrindinOMO @JamesHowlettBub @JacobARossi @realDonaldTrump All the money that you and your friends will ever make will never make a dent in our national debt. Your government is spending money faster than you can earn it. High stock prices actually HURT retirement planning - unless you're retiring TODAY! https://t.co/7yxThtl8uI
@ConnorDorsey028 @BlindMelon1967 @realDonaldTrump "record high" TODAY doesn't affect 401K unless you RETIRE today. It DOES devalue current contributions, and future corrections put your balance at risk. https://t.co/7yxThtl8uI
@EricS395311018 @Deon1121 @GrindinOMO @JamesHowlettBub @JacobARossi @realDonaldTrump Stock Market "record high" TODAY only helps a 401K if you RETIRE today. For everyone else, their contributions are devalued and balance at risk of correction. https://t.co/7yxThtl8uI

@SenWarren Note to @SenWarren: during the course of my campaign I will be repeatedly attacking members of Congress as "the wealthy, powerful, and well-connected who have corrupted our government". You are hereby excluded from that list.
@Augustus709 RYKM? He didn't write that!
