@Holly_A_K @RVAwonk You literally said you question her judgement. That was your opener.
@Holly_A_K @RVAwonk I'm not hiding behind the issue. It's the point I'm making. You're advancing a sense of fairness that is not tenable for victims and I'm rejecting it. Using Christina Ford as an example.
@IlGattoDaVinci @Lollardfish @RVAwonk By throw under the bus did you mean fairly called out?
@UTDemLttrDaySnt I'm proud of you.
@Holly_A_K @RVAwonk It isn't. Implying she has poor judgement is.
@Holly_A_K @RVAwonk Christina Ford still can't go home because of death threats, but sure.
@Holly_A_K @RVAwonk That's reductive and I think you know it.
@Holly_A_K @RVAwonk 0. Franken agreed to resign when Schumer asked him privately before anything went public. You misspelled "a woman running for president should be unfairly targeted."
@Holly_A_K @RVAwonk Your definition of fair serves men more than women. Same ole, same ole as a standard of "justice" in the US
@Holly_A_K @RVAwonk I think that's bad judgement on your part. 	You're not addressing the false equivalency. "trading one injustice for the other." Systemic dismissal &amp; arbitrary standards of burden of proof 4 sexual assault victims vs. a handful of falsely accused (which Franken admitted he is not)
@Holly_A_K @RVAwonk Great, I have several public admin. degrees. Yes, that's I mean, and my point here is that there is nothing for courts to enforce. And by your broader definition, how does that apply to this case? What government action was not constrained? To you see my point, yet?

@Holly_A_K @RVAwonk Students have hearings before getting suspended because of entirely different laws (title IX, etc.)
@Holly_A_K @RVAwonk Due process is fairness in the judicial system. That's literally it's definition. Other systems can employ processes of accountability/appeal, but they are not obligated by law. Due process is a legal gaurantee only in court.
@Holly_A_K @RVAwonk And to say that KG used poor judgement in this case is just a terrible hot take.
@Holly_A_K @RVAwonk But you're making a false equivalency. False accusations are a tiny fraction of accusations. And you have to believe that EIGHT women were lying to believe that's applicable here. If you want to go all in on defending men falsely accused this is a terrible example. 1/

@Holly_A_K @RVAwonk Due process literally does not apply outside the courtroom. By definition. 		And I think on the issue sexual harassment, it is about fucking time we have men prove their innocence.
@BlackSheep0ne @HotDamnTamale @RVAwonk (2) There was no forcing. It's literally impossible to force a Senator to resign. Franken voluntarily resigned. Before he could have a hearing. I wonder what he was afraid the hearing would reveal?
@BlackSheep0ne @HotDamnTamale @RVAwonk Your last sentence is complete bullshit. (1) she didn't lead anything, she was the first to make a public statement by a matter of minutes and AFTER Schumer had already spoken to Franken privately.
Male feminists do exist. They are the ones who are willing to amplify the voices of women without getting credit. They are the ones that call other men out on their bullshit. They are the ones willing to have less power and authority so that women can have more.
If you can only have positive relationships with women who revere you as Important and Powerful, you are *definitely* not a feminist. Also, I feel sorry for the women in your life who have to coddle you, pander to you, and diminish themselves to keep you happy.
You don't get "ally" points for doing things like hiring women or reading female authors. I mean, congratulations on realizing women are people in the year of our Lord 2019.
If you ever feel the urge to list all of the feminist things you've done to defend yourself against a criticism, don't. You'll only prove to the women in the room that your support is conditional on praise.
If you're only a feminist until you get criticized by a woman and then you're all, "why do I even try?!" you were never a feminist.
A couple of PSAs for men: 	When you say, "I love strong women" you're revealing that you don't think most women are. That's misogyny.

@Bohemianmoon I've lived in states with open primaries and I understand how that works. I also understand how a closed primary works. I also understand that primary is not a vote for representation, it is a vote for a preferred candidate. Get a grip, man. You're embarrassing yourself.

@jjfeinauer @notcodyshafer Okay, I guess I just don't really understand the point of this engagement. Imma let it go now.
@jjfeinauer @notcodyshafer or both
@jjfeinauer @notcodyshafer Based on this article, he is either ignorant of what it means to be a liberal, or what it means to be a Mormon
@notcodyshafer @jjfeinauer Oh yeah, the whole article is offensive. It shouldn't be a discussion.
@jjfeinauer @notcodyshafer But my initial tweet didn't claim they don't. It claimed it is ignorant do so. Which it is.
@jjfeinauer @notcodyshafer Again, I disagree both sides you use it. But anyway, why point that out if you're not defending Hancock?
@jjfeinauer @notcodyshafer There were too many negatives in that tweet.  But you get what I'm saying.
@jjfeinauer @notcodyshafer Of course not. But that is no reason to not point out that he shouldn't.
@notcodyshafer @jjfeinauer I think it was too. Just providing back up. :)
@jjfeinauer @notcodyshafer use of the term "pro-shooting" does happen. and it is equally offensive.
@notcodyshafer @jjfeinauer My first too, and I think that article is really sophomoric. She is definit. not a rep for any liberal I know
@notcodyshafer @jjfeinauer But there is no denying that pro-choice is way more accurate than pro-abortion.
@notcodyshafer @jjfeinauer That's the thing.  I have never seen that happen. Reproductive rights is for sure a more inclusive, better term.
Thing 1: "I'm just gonna get into my rocket ship and go home."		That explains A LOT. #fb
@jjfeinauer And I have never heard that term used by liberals.  I have only ever heard conservatives use it to describe liberals.
@jjfeinauer No one champions abortion for abortion's sake.  The correct term is pro-choice.
@jjfeinauer I don't think it is a term used by any one who has given the issue any serious consideration. It is crude.
