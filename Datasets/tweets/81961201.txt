@1_55_AM @SierraIguana @wolfejosh could you see a scencario where apple or google would buy tesla?
@SierraIguana @1_55_AM @wolfejosh can totally see Josh's line of reasoning, but i am less cynical. if tesla was still a cash burning monster, i don't think he'd risk harming SpaceX
@SierraIguana @1_55_AM @wolfejosh i believe he honestly does not want to step away from tesla now or sell because 1. he really does want to see electric cars win out and 2. it's no bueno for the image if it failed
@SierraIguana @1_55_AM @wolfejosh yeah. i think if there's a reasonable option where he could walk away from Tesla and make it look like a success, he'd prefer to just do spacex fulltime

People with Parkinson‚Äôs, ALS, Alzheimer‚Äôs ‚Äî they are all experiencing a compromised connection to the quantum field. They are flickering in and out, like a machine malfunctioning.
This effect is all around us, all the time. It‚Äôs the unseen layer of reality that is veiled from our eyes.
Flocks of birds, schools of fish: they are able to behave with apparent simultaneous¬†interdependence‚Äîsynchronicity‚Äîbecause¬†they are accessing the quantum field, this unified field of existence, in which all is one.
At the center of existence, all is one. And this phenomenon repeats itself, endlessly throughout existence, in circles. You can see it, if you look closely enough, in a pearl.
The hydrogen atom at the center of the pressure and the ring-(or sphere-)shaped ‚Äúsmear‚Äù of hydrogen that surrounds it are one and the same. It's the same atom. This is what we have also witnessed in so-called spooky action at a distance.
The central premise is that all illness involves oxalate‚Äîa crystal found in plants and other organisms capable of¬†photosynthesis‚Äîbecause¬†oxalate crystals are, in a sense, precipitates. They are the precipitate of time.
2,500 word Musk-related e-mail of the day goes to: "My symptoms would worsen after plane flights in which I changed time zones. I believe this is because of the perturbation of the e=mc2 equation which caused the endogenous production of oxalate‚Äîa precipitate of time, of light."

@r_mayne thanks man!
@CurtRenz They will likely sell a ton of Model 3s. I hope so. But as you point out, they've had problems getting every single model to market
@chrismessina @gaberivera Yeah, this is what I don't get. It seems like he's basing this all on what he imagined happened after he left because the invite was racy
P.S. - SpaceX went from nothing to setting the aerospace manufacturing and launch record in a bit more than a decade. In same time frame, Tesla . . . . well, Tesla recently made 793 Model 3s in a week
@spacecom Think he's just been sucked so deep into Tesla for a bit. He tends to bounce from near-death situation to near-death situation. In this case, the patient has been in ICU for quite awhile
@spacecom I dunno, man. There are way more Tesla fanboys and they are a rabid bunch too. The Tesla side has always felt stronger to me
@rickumali Almost sold to Google once. Much more at stake now - particularly to his reputation. But I do still see Google as the likely exit if things get worse. Google needs cars for its software. Believes in mission like Musk of electric. Has deep enough pockets
@GaryBleck Hmm. But one is setting production and delivery records while the other is doing the opposite
@toastunderbeans Mmm. Working on something different for the moment. Might revisit when Tesla situation plays out more clearly
@drivingmzstacey @elonmusk @Tesla @Waymo @johnkrafcik I dunno. Alphabet people don't exactly have the best track record of building things or doing anything in this area very quickly
@aweiss Nah. He doesn't believe they will see the electric car thing through. We talked about that quite a bit
But it's dang hard to think of other people that could pull this type of duality off.
What's clear to me is he seems able to go into different modes depending on the situation and basically does whatever it takes to keep his companies going. He's like a shape shifter, adjusting to the situation. This can look good and, yes, quite bad.
Anyway, I just find the black and white opinions on him and characterizations of him kinda baffling. We've only seen a couple folks run two companies of this scale at the same time. And I don't think we've ever seen those two companies be in such different states
Tesla was forced on him in many ways. He never wanted to run the company. He wanted to do SpaceX full time. Now his reputation is stretched between these two companies
I see people say, "Oh, Elon is full of it, and Tesla is a scam." or "Elon is the one person who finally proved private space can work." But there is no either or with this guy. He exists in a dual state
@EricNewcomer It's always fun to see an American face a European press contigent. They're much, much better about sticking together to try and get answers on tough questions
It seems really hard to argue that SpaceX doesn't save tax payers vast sums of money, while also returning the US to aerospace and scientific glories. Or that it's simply the real deal and a vast creator of jobs
It's also weird how conservatives and skeptics want to heap all their concerns for Tesla - ranging from Musk is a huckster to government credits and subsidies - onto SpaceX
These are obviously two very different industries and two different problems to solve. It's just funny to me that they can be so divergent in how they seem to cope with issues, to be run on a day-to-day basis and how reliant one is on Musk's star power while the other isn't
It's the low-cost provider in an incredibly complex industry, while Tesla's cars remain expensive.
These days, Tesla needs a lot of hype and promises about the future to keep investors and customers believing. SpaceX, meanwhile, just does its thing and does it really well.
And yet, Tesla has not been able to avoid this very thing.
Way back in 2014, when I was interviewing Musk, he predicted this very thing could happen at Tesla - that either the gigafactory or the Fredmont factory or both could sit idle - and said it would be apocalptyic. See below from my book https://t.co/ieZri3WGJ1
People still grumble about flaws with the S and X, and, well, the Model 3 is just kinda the worst case scenario at this point.
Since those early days, SpaceX has emerged as this incredibly consistent builder of freaking rockets, while Tesla has just never really seemed to hit its manufacturing stride.
At the outset, they were both kinda in the same boat - manufacturing hell.
It's kinda crazy to think sometimes that Tesla and SpaceX are run by the same person
