No, it's cuz they're "retarded"
@StefanMolyneux Yet Indian Americans are the highest income earning demographic in the entire country. It's almost as if your score on a fuckign IQ test is contingent on your access to quality education. HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM

@Loki120682 @KyleKashuv Oh okay, do you mind sharing the paper you wrote on this? I'm very interested in seeing your scientific findings and the numbers you've crunched
@Loki120682 @KyleKashuv There is no distinction. Climate scientists unanimously agree that human activity contributes to climate change by some meaningful degree. If you deny that, you are a climate science denier. Just man the fuck up and fucking be honest about it.
@DukeWHebert I AM NOT A RACIST. By the way, the child that I'm threatening to assault right now... he's a black.
@KyleKashuv I love how conservatives simultaneously reject the label "climate science denier" and then when the subject is brought up do ABSOLUTELY nothing but mock and scoff at any mention of climate change being a serious issue we need to address as a nation
These HILARIOUS memes from @scrowder got me thinking. Are there ANY funny conservative comics?
@RyanAFournier Your president is an obese dorito colored confirmed sexual assaulter who can't speak in full sentences
@charliekirk11 Charlie: This		Also Charlie: But it's absolutely okay that Jeff Bezos has 150 billion dollars and Amazon doesn't pay federal taxes and can broker dealers with leaders of major cities to siphon tax payer money for their operation. Also regulating the big banks is bad.
@benshapiro Can you guys please just stop being so mean to @JeffBezos... He's suffered enough. Amazon only made 11.2 Billion in profit last year and you expect him to pay his taxes you fucking commie dirtbags.

@larryelder Funny thing is Larry, that's how institutions work. Once the institution is set up in a particular way, you don't have to do anything to get the desired racist outcome but ofc conservatives can't process racism outside of a white guy directly calling his black employee the n word
@realDailyWire You're right guys. The real reasonable thing to do is to give them $3 billion dollars of NY taxpayer money as already one of the most profitable companies in the world. That's what a smart small government conservative would do.

@BambinoBambini @DanielTurnerPTF Considering I think capitalism is deeply flawed and I don't believe in the capacity for markets to solve any real social issues which must instead be addressed with political organization and democratic cooperation... no I'll still to DSA and not neolib.
@StefanMolyneux Fuck this is stupid even for Stevey
@BambinoBambini @DanielTurnerPTF It's better that billions of people across the world starve to death under American Imperialist rule so that we can have the best quality of life here (or at least the richest among us) is your argument I presume?
@BambinoBambini @DanielTurnerPTF So you just admit that it is more important for the most privileged elite people here to maintain their lifestyles than to distribute some of that wealth through jobs and programs to the world at large, particularly to the disadvantaged inhabitants of 3rd world countries.
@GadSaad @AOC Literally how do you call yourself an academic? What is the implication of this tweet other than you don't think climate change is a serious issue or that it's a laughing matter? Just fucking admit it Gad, you don't believe in climate change because the mean socialists do.
@GadSaad @AOC Gad is upset that without the academic pedigree he has, AOC who is substantially younger, has made a larger and more positive impact on the political landscape than he ever has and ever will.
@BambinoBambini @DanielTurnerPTF You do realize illegal immigrants are people too and do not possess any less moral consideration because they were born on a different piece of dirt, right?

@johnmackeyy @danfromtheweb Name one conservative that has spoken up about this or expressed how such wealth inequality is horrible for society. Name fucking one.
@RoccamSoccam @StefanMolyneux Oh that's why poverty is linked to criminality in every single society in history ever right? Just a weird coincidence I guess.
@MBruceS649210 @StefanMolyneux Nobody is forcing you to live here retard. Go to the beautiful white country of Poland.
@RoccamSoccam @StefanMolyneux Idk theres like this weird thing called poverty that tends to explain most criminality and there's this other thing called the drug war, and then there's institutional oppression through sentencing, red-lining, disenfranchisement of black voters no more than half a century ago...
@StefanMolyneux Well it's good to hear that Sfefan isn't offending by blackface
@danfromtheweb Conservatives: This is a good thing somehow
@StefanMolyneux Stef, you Giga-brain, I don't know if your IQ is too high to even process peasant English anymore but as it turns out the systemic oppression of one's recent ancestors, fathers, mothers, grandparents, actually may affect your outcomes as well!!! Shocking stuff, right?
@TPointUK Yeah unlike those good ideas like maybe murder and rape are wrong that are not mandatorily enforced by the state but simply the kindness and generosity of the public.

@SocioTarian @GadSaad @RubinReport Yeah you're not a fucking sociologist if that last statement isn't incredibly obvious to you. How's about you look at social mobility statistics by nation and see which nations rank the highest, the more free market capitalist ones or the bigger welfare state ones
@SocioTarian @GadSaad @RubinReport How on earth can you possibly be a libertarian as a sociologist. Do you just ignore the 90% of sociology that proves that we don't live in a meritocracy and the circumstances of your birth determine your life outcome in a capitalist society with incredibly high probability?

@prageru @Spotify Imagine actually having such a victim mentality that crying you can’t post ads on a private companies service is censorship
@RubinReport Almost like when you just constantly shill for your fellow “intellectual dark web” posse
@jordanbpeterson Lobsters... intelligence...
@elmypepper @EricTrump @TrumpJupiter Eric sits at home in his MAGA pajamas and jerks off to pictures of his dad not playing with him as a kid.
@EricTrump @TrumpJupiter Eric would sooner spend 50 million dollars on a 50 acre plot of grass with holes than give 5 bucks to the homeless guy living in a cardboard box outside Trump tower
@DonaldJTrumpJr Don Jr. likes destroying conservative minors in other ways
@StefanMolyneux In the mountains of Asia it was very evolutionarily adaptive to figure out how many points the next star has in the sequenece
@AnnCoulter “Pot is a gateway drug” Ann murmurs while slumped on the couch after consuming a cocktail of perscription opiates and slamming down a wine bottle.

@benshapiro Unborn baby is Ben’s nickname around the office
@realDonaldTrump @DougWead Somebody trying to tell Donny that FDR and LBJ gave people jobs with government programs while our boy hasn’t paid gov employees in a month
@StefanMolyneux Stefan getting horny thinking about those apple cheeks
@dpakman @charliekirk11 @AOC The part where she said the government should do stuff
@benshapiro Yo nobody tell little Benny that all major technological innovation comes from government funded research and universities. It would crush his little heart. 😢
@benshapiro This is what Ben said the three times he prematurely came in his wife
@benshapiro Yeah yo what kind of fucking retard thinks that half of old people having no retirement savings is bad. Am I right fellas?
@PrisonPlanet Yo nobody tell Paul that Orwell was a socialist. It would break his little heart.

@w_terrence @DeplorableChoir @Deplorableshow Is this the casting couch for Republicans?
@benshapiro is short. 		That is all.
@benshapiro @AOC When it's been 7 minutes and you haven't tweeted about @AOC yet
@StefanMolyneux Stefan was the kid at school who said "Nu huh YOU'RE gay."
@StefanMolyneux Stefan's IQ is so high he can telepathically communicate with other brains
@winklevosss @NicholasVietMar @charliekirk11 so true brother
The #1 thing young conservatives are good at conserving is their virginities.
@StefanMolyneux Yeah these fucking weird NPC Libtard cuck soyboys keep using the same lingo. It's so cringe.
@StefanMolyneux Stefan was supposed to join the military as a lieutenant but they told him his IQ was below the admittable range.
@charliekirk11 Charlie's nickname around the office is actually "fully formed human baby."

@JFNYC1 Damn, my man came this close to getting it in
@RyanAFournier This the jingle Ryan's dad told the nanny to sing to him to help him fall asleep as a child.
@FrankelJeremy @benshapiro LOL at Ben Shapiro talking to women
@larryelder @realDonaldTrump Being a black conservative means the "I'm not racist, I have black friends" move works on you.
@StefanMolyneux Stefan got one window where be re-taking online IQ tests and another window where he compares his score with what profession he could have gotten if they didn't pay him to be racist on the internet
@RubinReport I bought the MAJORITY of your apparel, Dave! Your videos with the bald IQ guy really helped me write my school REPORT.
@RealJamesWoods @jack You can't tell me that kid doesn't look like the troll face
@RealCandaceO @AOC @MaxineWaters Fast forward 12 years.  Hundreds of thousands have been displaced from their homes due to rising water levels. Candace sits comfortably in her luxury New York apartment thinking "Hah, it snowed this year. Take that libcucks."
@StefanMolyneux Stefan pees in the sink exclusively
@charliekirk11 Yesterday I passed by Charlie staring down a homeless man, pulling a ten dollar bill out of his pocket, blowing his nose into it, and throwing it in the trash.
@charliekirk11 Turning Point USA
@charliekirk11 Charlie sleeps with a night light so he can see if the Left tries to come out of his closet to spook him
@charliekirk11 It's already a federal crime that you have a paycheck
@TheRightMelissa No you moron. He was saying "cracka" with the soft A. It's a term of endearment.
@kanyewest When you watch three Candace Owen's videos and think you're woke
@charliekirk11 Charlie thinks the salsa at Chipotle is too spicy
@realDonaldTrump Trump keeping the government shut down so he can avoid paying workers again. "I only make the best deals. Paying people for their labor? That's not a good deal, folks."
@StefanMolyneux Stefan got a side gig teaching Racist Algebra II at Trump University
@StefanMolyneux Stefan Molyneux: "Why doesn't Hollywood make a White Panther?"

@KyleKulinski Hey Kyle, I think you should look closely at Andrew Yang, a 2020 presidential candidate. His platform of UBI is a breath of fresh air from the usual free market vs socialism debate. He both wants to maintain the benefits of capitalism while addressing its inequities
@AndrewYangVFA I'm a fan of your unique platform. It seems to maintain all the benefits of capitalism / private industry while addressing the inequities. I think you should contact Joe Rogan and try to do his show. The publicity would be huge and I bet he would have you on.
