@redambition @SixInchHeel still fail miserably all the time but I am not giving up. Just giving up buying fabric until I ruin current stash.
@redambition @SixInchHeel I'm pretty much back to the process of using a pattern as a base, making/fitting a muslin, redrafting THEN sewing.
@SixInchHeel @redambition I find their normal range too small, &amp; their plus-size patterns too OH MY GOD LOOK IM A FAT PERSON WEARING A SACK
@SixInchHeel @redambition I really don't see why they can't generate them individually for ALL sizes, WITH seam allowance. As an in-between
@redambition @SixInchHeel also, WHY NO MATCHING POINTS?! It makes me sew angry.
@SixInchHeel then realised I was a major dumb-dumb. Wasted more of some favourite fabric AGAIN #sewworldproblems
@SixInchHeel I know they don't, but I forgot on Sat. Had a size-related meltdown thinking that I am too fat to fit into any of them...

@ASOS_HeretoHelp I would appreciate a response. It‚Äôs insane that I used an express shipping code you provided only to have it ship standard.
@PromRoyalty what. the. eff. Oh my god, I‚Äôm seriously going to lose it.
@PromRoyalty you‚Äôre having the same problem?
@randomknits @mellalicious Im rarely upset like this. I had an tearful meltdown in front of my husband bc now I  have nothing to give him :(

@stufromoz we usually do it on Saturday afternoon. But we were pooped yesterday, and have plans this afternoon hence, beer.
@stufromoz yes. Because I looked at the amount of screaming children in the supermarket and decided I couldn't get through it without beer.
Grocery shopping, made easier.  http://t.co/6sbAau5Y
