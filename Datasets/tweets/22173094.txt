@nken75 @MayorJenny Sorry. I’m watching the feed from our studio prior to noon show and it was fast. Didn’t see. Let’s see if @EssexKIRO7 knows... but give him time committee is now talking the original proposal of $500/employee
#Breaking Amendment 17 fails to pass Seattle City Council committee: it would've cut in half the proposed #headtax  and made it $250/per employee. It was proposed by @MayorJenny last night in what some called the "Bezos/Durkan deal"
Closing remarks now on new proposal to make the #headtax $250/per worker. Council President Harrell draws laughs from crowd in council chambers when he says this proposal was not a "backroom deal." @KIRO7Seattle
