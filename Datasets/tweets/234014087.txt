More than 90% of Americans support universal background checks. That’s why I am voted to pass #HR8, a bipartisan bill to #EndGunViolence and expand background checks – and it’s why I encourage my colleagues in the Senate to do the same.

With all the talk about the #TrumpShutdown, there’s a great deal of confusion about what that actually means. Here’s a quick explainer on what the government shutdown means for Americans: https://t.co/HG3wz1kDxp
.@SpeakerRyan’s support for the #TrumpShutdown to secure $5 billion for an unwanted and unneeded border wall is the height of hypocrisy. Have you no shame, @SpeakerRyan? https://t.co/BdIOBA3faN
If @SpeakerRyan truly cared about the deficit he would oppose a #TrumpShutdown over $5 billion in taxpayer dollars to be wasted on a border wall that 69% of Americans say isn’t a priority. #HypocriteRyan
.@SpeakerRyan built his reputation on being a deficit hawk, but the numbers don't lie. 	  FY18 Deficit (under Ryan's watch): $782 b	  FY15 (year before he got the gavel): $439 b
How’s that going, @SpeakerRyan? Your tax bill added $1.5 trillion to the national debt and now you want a #TrumpShutdown over $5 billion for a border wall that experts agree is useless. https://t.co/4fluhuC8ZN
.@realDonaldTrump should stop holding the nation hostage to his radical demands. #NoBorderWall #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/3UwliIne1m

The #FirstStepAct is a good first step toward fixing the inequities in our nation's criminal justice system, but there is still much more to be done, including putting a plug in the school-to-prison pipeline.

Minority &amp; low-income communities across the U.S., like the one I represent, face similar barriers: high unemployment &amp; crime rates, inadequate access to health care &amp; good schools. In the next Congress, Democrats must fight #ForThePeople who struggle most.
Miami-Dade &amp; Broward counties each contain two separate worlds: one for those with resources &amp; another for those without. Gallop Poll once named the ones I represent as the “nation’s most suffering,” That’s why I fight so hard to give voice to the voiceless.

Leader @NancyPelosi stood with us in an effort to cement the legacy of pioneer and @akasorority1908 founder, Ethel Hedgeman Lyle, with a USPS Forever Stamp. Her longstanding commitment to the Democratic caucus and its members is one of the reasons I support her for Speaker. https://t.co/N35Sj4DQsX

President Trump's cruel policy separated children from their parents without a plan for reuniting them. Even worse, they deported some moms and dads before they were able to recover their children. This can't stand! We must #KeepFamiliesTogether! https://t.co/nYV9iLYzfC

Children should not be ripped from the arms of their parents.  Babies need to stay with their loving parents. #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct stops the #Trump administration's government sanctioned child abuse policy. https://t.co/SAa907TWxf
The #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct establishes a preference for family unity, discourages the separation of siblings, and creates a presumption that detention is not in the best interests of families and children. https://t.co/9hEky3SsrJ
FACT: The #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct defers the prosecution of parents who are asylum seekers and adopts the recommendation of the @DHSgov Office of Inspector General. https://t.co/lI7njrqM0O

Today a bipartisan group of lawmakers rejected the Republican #farmbill2018. Some voted against this punitive legislation for all the wrong reasons, but I am pleased that at least for now struggling families have been spared its injurious effects.

There are too many damn guns in America, but just a year ago, Congress passed and President Trump signed a law revoking an Obama-era regulation that made it more difficult for people with mental illness to buy guns. #EnoughIsEnough
There's been a lot of debate about how much of an impact enhanced background checks and other measures would actually have on reducing gun violence. What we do know is that making it easier to buy guns will most likely increase the likelihood of gun violence. #EnoughIsEnough

Leaders around the world have widely condemned President Trump’s racist and disgraceful remarks about Haiti. But actions speak far louder than words. It is incumbent upon world leaders and President Trump to contribute to the cholera trust fund.
It is unconscionable that the richest nations in the world are abdicating their duty to support #Haiti's cholera trust fund.
The 2010 earthquake was devastating enough and Haiti is still suffering from its-after effects. Cholera has exacerbated the crisis. Many Haitians who thankfully survived the disease lost their homes and livelihoods during their recovery because they were unable to work.
Shamefully, it took six years for the UN to acknowledge and apologize for UN peacekeepers’ role in #Haiti's cholera crisis but launched a $400 million Haiti Cholera Response Multi-Partner Trust Fund to address it and aid victims.
Eight years ago, Haiti was struck by a double whammy in the form of a major earthquake and a cholera epidemic. The former was unpreventable, but the spread of cholera was indisputably the result of human error.
Today is the anniversary of the earthquake that 8 years ago shook Haiti to its core. Few if any nations have withstood so many natural disasters &amp; its citizens’ resilience has been remarkable. Let us reaffirm our commitment to the country to aid its ongoing efforts to rebuild.

Soon @HouseGOP will attempt to pass, #HR38, “Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act.” 	Under @HouseGOP's #HR38 bill, states with STRONG concealed carry laws are forced to honor concealed carry permits from states with very weak laws. #StopCCR		Does that seem right to you?
#HR38 is vehemently opposed by numerous law enforcement and other organizations, including the Law Enforcement Partnership to Prevent Gun Violence. #StopCCR
#HR38 includes provisions that would put law enforcement officers in danger of being sued for trying to confirm that an out-of-state permit is valid. #StopCCR
#HR38 does NOT create a national standard across states for who is eligible for a concealed carry permit. This awful bill gives the weakest state laws the furthest reach. #StopCCR
Danger! Danger! Today @HouseGOP hopes to pass the #ConcealedCarryReciprocityAct, which will give states with the weakest gun laws the furthest reach.
In a cynical move, @HouseGOP is tying the bad #ConcealedCarryReciprocity Act to a bipartisan bill that aims to improve the national background check system. RT if you are as appalled as I am.
Concealed weapons will cause even greater harm to communities already dealing with the heavy toll of gun violence. #ConcealedCarryReciprocity is a very bad idea! RT if you agree.
