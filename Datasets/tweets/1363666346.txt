@RashtrapatiBhvn A great Indian tradition followed by people of many different faiths
After 69 years of Freedom, no end to Reservations.Justice and Equality has become just a LIP Service provided by politicians
West Easy money Low growth India to win votes more subsidies/ more loan write off, "We are in good shape" RBI says, which is right policy?
Justice and equality/ before 1947, 350 kingdoms more than 400 languages.	Now only one pet language Hindi
Looks like China is fast dynamic/ first devaluation of yuan now interest rate cut. Is their policy right or is India sleeping?

In India/ weak govt/ weak goverance/ weakness is seen everywhere.	Human weakness is exploited by politicians.
Man lost his tail long ago / he still behaves like a monkey. Human nature is still the same.
This world has room/ food for all but still we find people sleeping on the road/ dying of hunger.
there is nothing wrong with the Alcohol but something with the person who consume it.
