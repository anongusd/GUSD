@politialy @pamelaowsinek @MpK20016 @B_Ehrenreich I guess it was poorly written, my fault.  It was a sentiment that some other women and I discussed.
@MpK20016 @pamelaowsinek @B_Ehrenreich Not at all what I meant.  Move on!  You spent your whole day on this.. really you have nothing better to do
@pamelaowsinek @politialy @MpK20016 @B_Ehrenreich I'm married.  Our family has never received government assitance.  I don't sleep around.  I meant my tweet as an expression of how frustrating how it feels 2 be a woman in modern society.
@pamelaowsinek @MpK20016 @B_Ehrenreich Just because I believe in a strong social safety net doesn't mean that I want handouts.  It doesn't mean that I expect others to pay for me whole I don't work.   		I am trying to make the point that things are becoming increasingly difficult for women.
@TulsiGabbard This is why we need more women in government!
@Lin_Manuel Pawsome!
@B_Ehrenreich I can't get BC 2 prevent unwanted pregnancy, can't get an abortion, can't afford insurance to have the baby; can't get social support programs to help feed and shelter baby; can't afford an education to get a job and support baby on my own...		What do I get besides screwed?
@ShaunKing @WhiteHouse What bothers me more than anything else is that the Rs will continue to claim to be the party of morals and good values, and the voters will believe them.  They are reverse Robin Hoods whose cruelty and hypocrisy knows no bounds...
@emayfarris Yes!!!  We need this!
@PattiScozz @DarrenBaker @AxolotlYourself @punditshaps @LeeannTweeden @mattdpearce @alfranken It is from an essay Sanders wrote in the 1970s		https://t.co/PmnruutJpe
@SenSanders I think we will be asking this question about a lot of issues.  We will ask why our govt gave tax breaks to the 1% while 1/5 kids don't have enough food; we will ask why our govt did nothing while innocent people were killed in mass shootings; and so much more.....
@toddzwillich @NomikiKonst @BernieSanders @TheTakeaway Do you think that the Democrats recent wins were due to the fact that (1) voters dislike Trump and his policies, or (2) that Democrats are doing a better job of appealing to voters?  What needs to be done to have another big night in 2018?
@haymarketbooks I'm so excited!
@mattyglesias Our problems could be easily fixed, which is what makes them so frustrating.  Our existence doesn't need to be a constant struggle to survive and achieve the American dream.  Sadly, our government has decided that the American dream is less important than than donors &amp; 1%
@IronStache Yes !
@lsarsour If Sandy Hook wasn't enough, nothing will ever motivate the government to change things.
@ezraklein News will be all over the widow story and everyone will forget that we are handing over millions of $s 2 1%  this isn't an accident
@DraftBernie They keep on doing the same thing despite losing for years.  If you are steadily loosing, change something!  Listen 2 voters not lobbyists
@RoseAnnDeMoro The Dems have no real interest in improving the party.  They just want 2 regain power while pleasing their donors and lobbyists.
@MarketWatch In other words they are saying - dear America go f $!k off and die already
@Amyws12 @ezraklein Yes!!  I hate it when people call it Obamacare...such a bad idea.
@justicedems Women get shit done!
@PattyMurray You have to do something about childcare.  When my infant was in daycare, it cost $1,100/month!  How can anyone afford that?
RT @paulkrugman: "Sire, the people don't have power, water, or food"		"Let them eat paper towels"
@SenatorCantwell Do SOMETHING! U r a U.S. Senator, 1 of the most powerful people in the world.  U have the power 2 stop it - ACT! Ur words mean nothing - ACT
@PattyMurray Don't be sad!  DO SOMETHING!  You have the power to make real change and prevent tragedies.  Act don't talk.  We demand change!
@IndivisibleTeam It isn't dead!  Rs will try again &amp; again until they succeed or get voted out. Get them out!
@PattyMurray Support single payer!
