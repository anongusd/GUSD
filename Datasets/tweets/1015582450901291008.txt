@estarianne @LissandraVilla @AOC @BernieSanders I follow her on Twitter.  I‚Äôm interested in her economic positions.  But I truly have not seen her say much about Trump or about the corruption of this administration.
@estarianne @LissandraVilla @AOC @BernieSanders You attacked me. You didn‚Äôt say, ‚Äúthat may not be true,‚Äù or ‚Äúthe evidence doesn‚Äôt support that,‚Äù you said, ‚ÄúLIES.‚Äù That‚Äôs personal, &amp; suggests motive; that I knowingly stated an untruth, not that I lacked evidence. Still, I gave you the benefit of the doubt, &amp; asked for evidence.
@estarianne @LissandraVilla @AOC @BernieSanders You attacked me.  I did not seek you out with my claims
@estarianne @LissandraVilla @AOC @BernieSanders You‚Äôre not convincing me, this way.
@estarianne @LissandraVilla @AOC @BernieSanders As we all know, it is complicated to ‚Äúprove‚Äù an absence.  But proving something substantive, such as @AOC‚Äôs supposed constant attention to and interest in oversight, ought to be easy‚Äîjust a couple examples would prove me wrong.  So go for it.
@estarianne @LissandraVilla @AOC @BernieSanders So that‚Äôs a no on providing any evidence, then. . .   Ok.
@estarianne @LissandraVilla @AOC @BernieSanders Evidence? And what exactly are you claiming are lies?
@AlexMcDaniel Okra is slimy and gross.
@ShaneGoldmacher @AOC I hope that @AOC treats @RepCummings with respect; she hasn‚Äôt shown any respect for experience or seniority so far.  I hope she does not derail this important oversight work, which @RepCummings has been doing so scrupulously and well.
@AOC Perhaps it‚Äôs the meaning, and not the exact words, that people care about. You did agree that you give zero whatevers about what democrats think, and to me, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs important about this story. Why absolutely dismiss the views of so many of us in supposedly your own party?
