BIDEN touting fencing in 2006:		“People are driving across that border with tons, tons — hear me — tons of everything from byproducts for methamphetamine to cocaine to heroin. And it’s all coming up through corrupt Mexico.”		https://t.co/tMlLQpQEBF		https://t.co/nYILDJvMNL
In 2006, then-Sen. Barack Obama voted for new fencing, touting it as a mechanism for “better security along our borders."		And Sen. Dianne Feinstein suggested in an interview that she would support a fence along the *entire* Mexican border.		https://t.co/tMlLQpz3d5 https://t.co/0MykVlbPBz
Of note:		Conditions at the border now are different than in 2006 or 2013 (fewer illegal crossings and more family units arriving at the border).		https://t.co/tMlLQpQEBF
Most Democrats now oppose Trump’s request of $5.7 billion for 234 miles of new steel barriers (Trump has been inconsistent about what the barriers would be).		Democrats have offered Trump $1.3 billion to reinforce existing southern border barriers.		https://t.co/tMlLQpQEBF
In 2006, Democrats voted to authorize $1.4 billion for 700 miles of fencing along the southern border.		In 2013, every Senate Democrat voted to authorize $7.5 billion for an additional 700 miles of fencing (~350 miles would have been redundant fencing).		https://t.co/tMlLQpQEBF

Watch the many proposals Trump is “looking at” in @thefix’s latest supercut: https://t.co/dfgWm0pjsE
- A plan for Yucca Mountain	- Changing transgender rights	- Changing libel laws	- Congressional term limits	- A Muslim registry	- Divesting from his business	- Releasing his tax returns	- A mission to Mars
- Changing quarterly earnings reports	- Declassifying Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act documents	- Opening a permanent U.S. military base in Poland	- Firing Attorney General Jeff Sessions	- A tariff exemption for Mid Continent Nail	- A military intervention in Venezuela
- A resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict	- Purging leaks in the WH	- A policy for Chinese construction in the South China Sea	- Tightening gun laws	- Calling for line-item veto authority	- Labeling China a currency manipulator	- Indexing capital gains to inflation
Among the proposals floated, but not implemented by Trump:		- Revoking birthright citizenship	- A new middle-class tax cut	- DACA	- An infrastructure plan	- Breaking up Wall Street banks	- Raising the gas tax	- CIA “black sites”	- Charging Mexico for a southern border wall
As president, Trump has increasingly floated thin or nonexistent policy proposals, often accompanied by caveats with some variation of “we’re looking into it." https://t.co/bznJFj2FRi
