@SamEBNHPR Absolutely. I will give in to some temptation to compare, but w/ offshore oil tracts, you may be talking 9 square miles (5,760 acres). Here, the three leases up for grabs are at least 22 times the size of a typical U.S. offshore oil block, at 128,811, 127,388 and 132,370 acres.

@CU_Trader Your takeaway doesn't change. Unified agenda timelines often slip, &amp; moving from a February proposal to a May final rule would be awfully quick. The rulemaking needs to be robust to have a stronger chance in court, but it seems folks are right to be concerned about timing too.
@CU_Trader The reset proposal isn't being reviewed by OMB/OIRA yet. But it's moving on a faster timetable than E15. In govt's unified agenda, EPA says it aims to propose reset in Jan. (aiming to finalize in Dec.) &amp; E15 measure in Feb. (aiming to finalize in May). ($) https://t.co/pdgWknfeZJ

@Manstaine1 Whenever the EPA proposes any RIN changes, there will be another round of public comments and quite possibly significant alterations before *any* final rule. Although options have been outlined, not all -- &amp; maybe not any -- will come to pass.
@oilbear1987 @JordanFife1 @bsims1977 Understood. What about yesterday (or, more accurately, 2013)?
@BiofuelBrian Fair point! Admittedly, we've spent weeks writing in detail about the coming E15 announcement. (By contrast, though we've previewed the RIN market move, we had a bit more detail about the full suite of options on the table today, so it felt newer).
@oilbear1987 @JordanFife1 @bsims1977 The contemplated RIN market changes include one that would block any non-obligated parties from trading RINs. That includes any trading desks that want to get in on the action but aren't importing or refining fuel.
President Trump is moving to clamp down on a shadowy $2.25 billion market in biofuel compliance credits, embracing reforms that could block Wall Street banks from trading them.		Trump is also telling the EPA to enable year-round sales of gasoline containing as much as 15% ethanol
Even if they fail &amp; Trump announces he'll OK year-round E15 sales, his pledge won't immediately be paired w/ a formal EPA proposal to make the change. Is that enough certainty for Iowa Republicans &amp; ethanol producers - or just a window for more oil industry opposition? (3/3)

@ScottSegal3 @ScottIrwinUI The statute lays out cellulosic waiver credits but doesn't do the same for D6s/D4s.

@joshdr83 I don't believe there is any phase-in or drop-off in value. But the value differs depending on how it is stored. It's a $50 credit for every ton of carbon dioxide that’s just geologically stored and $35 for every ton used for EOR.

@bennussdorf There are plenty of strategic reasons not to keep every planning area in the draft proposed program from the very get go, especially areas that are certain to be ruled out later: All that NEPA work and public comment assimilation takes time and strains resources.
The decision means the @Interior Dept. is foreclosing new lease sales from 2019 to 2024 in the Florida straits, Atlantic waters near Florida &amp; the eastern Gulf of Mexico. https://t.co/eTcHftl4YJ

OK, administrative law &amp; OCSLA experts: 	In assembling the five-year OCS leasing plan, does the "arbitrary and capricious" standard of the APA rule, or does other language in OCSLA trump it somehow?
@SecretaryZinke Before the @Interior Dept assembled its draft plan for selling offshore drilling rights, governors had a chance to weigh in w/ their views.

In agreeing to yank Florida (and the eastern Gulf of Mexico) out of the next 5-year plan to sell offshore drilling rights, the Trump administration is zapping one of the few new areas the oil industry was really interested in.
@MarkSBrownstein Indeed. They haven’t won every fight. The lost big on the venting and flaring CRA repeal in Congress. And courts that are already proving to be a check on unlawful rule delays may be a barrier to regulatory rollbacks too.

@NeonAzollaEvent The onus would be on blenders then. There are refiners and oil companies with blending facilities, so there is crossover.
The pun of the day belongs to @SenMarkey. News release: "President Trump Muddies the Water with Executive Order on Clean Water Rule."
@NeonAzollaEvent no the opposite. companies that refine but don't blend (so-called merchant refiners) have to buy RINs to comply.
@NeonAzollaEvent RINs are generated at the point of blending, so companies w/ blending facilities but no refining operations can sell them.
@NeonAzollaEvent Icahn owns majority stake in a refiner with limited to no blending capacity, so it has to buy RINs to satisfy RFS.

For all the predictions of lots of OPEC bashing today, Trump didn't dwell on it much. This was more detailed than some pundits expected.
Nothing makes an energy speech more appealing than Jock Jams.
Trump speech panders to fossil fuel industry w/ "carbon-copy energy plan" that could have come "directly from Mitch McConnell." - @LCVoters
Trump's test for new regs: "Is this regulation good for the American worker?" Promises "proper regard for rational" environmental concerns.
.@RealDonaldTrump promises to save the coal industry &amp; rescind WOTUS rule &amp; Obama's climate plan w/in first 100 days.
.@realdonaldtrump promises to solve "real environmental challenges" and "problems" such as tainted drinking water.
"The government should not pick winners &amp; losers. Instead, it should move obstacles to exploration." - @RealDonaldTrump
We'll get bureaucracy out of the way, so we can pursue all forms of energy, including renewable, @realDonaldTrump says.
The Iran deal: Turns out it's good for tortured #KXL metaphors as well as crude export advocates.

"President Obama has done everything he can to get in the way of American energy," @realDonaldTrump says, decrying "costly" regs.

.@realdonaldtrump repeats view that Americans should get a piece of the profits on #KXL. A lot of times, he says, "pipelines are better."

RT @taykuy: Donald Trump says coal will one day be very inexpensive. That's the problem Donald.
Glad we're seeing some energy questions, including how @realdonaldtrump can bring coal jobs back, amid low gas prices.

Delta SVP Graeme Burnett delivers rejoinder to @RepMikePompeo: "We want a level playing field." #oil
.@RepMikePompeo says refiners want products they sell to be priced as high as they can get and the oil they purchase to be price controlled.
"OPEC loves the fact that we have an export ban, I promise you. We're playing right into their strategy."  - Pioneer CEO Scott Sheffield
Remember, refineries' views on #oil exports depend on their exposure. Inland, non-integrated refineries could be harder hit.
Summing up the #oil export debate, @amyjaffeenergy observes: "We're really arguing about who gets the margin."
What makes LNG exports different than oil exports? asks @RepBillJohnson. Simple question, complex answers. Kingston notes US ties to Brent.
It's entirely possible US lifts #oil export ban &amp; "nothing happens," because US refiners still enjoy cost advantages @MHFI's Kingston says.
@PracticalVoter A subject of debate that is not getting much air time today - from either side of the aisle.
Tricky politics &amp; gasoline price fears surround #oil exports, @RepShimkus notes. "It's probably why we're not going as fast on this as…LNG."

As lawmakers leave the @HouseCommerce #oil export hearing for floor votes on DHS spending, 4 Texans remain to ask questions.
Refiners will take US light crude at a price - Pioneer's Sheffield. "To refine light sweet crude, they have to charge an economic penalty."
@david_turnbull If they did, I missed it too. But I don't think it has come up in any capacity.
.@AFLCIO's Markell and @AFPMonline's Drevna both suggest we stop focusing on gasoline prices amid #oil export debate.
Per @amyjaffeenergy "giant stockpile" comment MT @mjcrinklaw US has so much oil it's running out of places to put it: http://t.co/dQjWkPTdY0
@AriNatter I feel like the witness table is already so evenly divided this hearing is ping pong. @USCRUDE @OilExports
"We all benefit from letting these refineries run at the highest level they can," even if that means gasoline exports." - @MHFI's Kingston
When refiners talk up a "holistic" approach to #oil exports &amp; energy policy, they're aiming at the Jones Act: http://t.co/R0GKwR0ln5
"We don't need to have this devolve into an upstream versus downstream debate. We're all in this together." - @AFPMonline's Drevna #oil
Why would any policymaker want to risk jeopardizing consumer benefits of low oil prices, asks @Delta's Burnett. Bkgd: http://t.co/frIAhlHnfC
Would you rather have US #oil refined overseas or by American workers in the US, @AFLCIO Brad Markell asks @Housecommerce.
"Easing restrictions on crude oil exports threatens the long-run health of the refining sector &amp; the jobs it provides" - @AFLCIO's Markell
"We have this giant stockpile of #oil that's sitting with no place to go. That is a market inefficiency." - @AmyJaffeenergy

Condensate exports are allowing Pioneer to realize an extra $8/barrel in supplying Europe, Japan &amp; South Korea, Sheffield says.
Pioneer CEO Sheffield hoists up a piece of Wolfcamp shale rock as he touts advancements in domestic #oil technology &amp; production.
Not exactly a headlong rush. Congress should examine all "impacts before considering any modifications to energy policy"- @RepFredUpton
Congress should consider whether "rushing to short-term production of as much #oil as possible is the best strategy," @RepMcNerney says.
Two numbers to know during the #SubEnergyPower hearing:	WTI crude: $49.59	WTI-Brent differential AKA the "export arbitrage:" $10
