Thank you for your patience FDA/readers. 	@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA @tv6tnt @OPM_TT
Tell her she has always sensed my honesty and she needs to trust my words now. Even if she is wrapped in a towel take her from there.
I was not playing when I mentioned Christine, Zin‚Äôs fianc√©. I know he will try to kill her in his madness. Their house is on Constabulary Street, Carenage. Directly in front of the cemetery. Eerie. You need to tell her he wants to kill her. That I said that.
Please, I need immediate protection. You need to get me right away if you intend to help me.. I am in Charlotteville, Tobago; that‚Äôs the very NE of the island. Please get me by helicopter.
P.s Honourable PM, Honourable OL, Hon. CJ: I have the gift of prophecy‚Äîbut it does not take any such gift to have anyone know that I may be kidnapped; I will be and even before any of that money can get to me. I will be killed by my kidnappers too.

Evil sacrifices backfire. One of your children died‚Äînot by my tears, only by the tears of another cousin; how much of my tears have fallen on your living children Zin Mark King?
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA You‚Äôre sacrificing a niece/cousin you don‚Äôt like, and the only reason you‚Äôre not sacrificing your fianc√© is because you want her to raise the children you‚Äôre putting in her belly?  People‚Äôs tears fall; what you do have a way of coming back to you.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA Don‚Äôt let people‚Äôs sadness rest on you, don‚Äôt let their tears fall on you; my tears have fallen on my aunt and her son; how much do you think they will lose now; surely he will be disbarred from the legal fraternity and demoted (if not fired) by the CGuard
if you can give someone something give it to them. It is for them, withholding it does not accrue anything onto you.

We need pioneers to Turn the Tide; come on FDA, Swim at the Speed of Stars; @Rihanna‚Äôs going to get you. We don‚Äôt want to be bucked FDA, or ducked, or docked. If the FDA‚Äôs is taking care of us, we need to love it.
You‚Äôre the @BOSS in your healthcare. BOSS. This is my health, I own this. Everyone needs to Think Fast and Move at the Speed of a @Puma. Let‚Äôs get this thing done. How about you Speedo? It‚Äôs not good enough to only go with the tide. @Speedo.Turn the Tide FDA.FDA, can you keep up?
What about you @BOSS? Do you think people should have a say in their healthcare? Obvious answer. BOSS. Be the BOSS.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA @Puma, you with me? You need to Think Fast. We need to think fast. Move at the Speed of Puma,FDA‚ÄîI like this Puma, what was your previous tagline again? I like this. I love it. Really love it.
that‚Äôs not the kind of action we want. You like your tagline @Converse? I love it! 	Makes me want to visit your stores‚Äîwhere I do not bump into anyone who works at the FDA, and especially not my family.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA We need @Converse for this. Converse, can you be the one that demands Real Action? Let the FDA know we need More Than Talk. How will you respond FDA? @Converse. Real Action. More than Talk. You have already been fooling people;
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA They can get those anywhere, but how about you give them that with a heart? How about shorts too, really soft lining, for women who do not like wearing panties too much but are concerned about their shape. We ought to @Converse on a real level.
with waves lapping at their feet? How about that? @rihanna
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA Since you‚Äôre all about Savage, how about you give women the best blouses ever, so they run around wild and free; make them feel like they‚Äôre running around Barbados, with the sunshine caressing their skin, the sand trickling through their toes,
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA Are those drugs working for women? @Rihanna‚Äôs all about bras now‚Äîshe‚Äôs entirely Savage, With a Heart. But everybody knows Rihanna doesn‚Äôt like bras as much as she‚Äôs promoting them. Oops. Your secret‚Äôs out.
She‚Äôs Savage, With a Heart; can you be FDA, with a heart?  Are you giving the best in heart healthcare‚Äîmakes me wonder. Oops, what about breasts health? How are you treating women who have breasts cancer? @FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA @rihanna
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA @rihanna , Fenty is beauty for all, but the FDA‚Äôs drugs‚Äîno, no, no. They‚Äôre messing with people.  She‚Äôs Savage, FDA; there‚Äôs no telling what she will do.
Caribbean will provide for your needs soon.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA World! Head to Jamaica, place your order. Jamaican farmers, diversify your gardens! Get Jamrock out of debt‚Äî‚Äòcause we know everywhere the World Bank and the IMF has been is messed up.  Trinidad and Tobago and the other islands of the
diversify, for medicine; only for medicine, you don‚Äôt want to saturate the market. Doctors everywhere! Pioneers of medicine!
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA Careful FDA, Rocafella is Rocafella, they‚Äôll Rock you. I say we begin with the marijuana. To Jamaica; Trinidad and Tobago, those plants you have been destroying can start turning around the economy;
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA That is wrong; surely it goes against the oaths that must be taken to practice medicine? It‚Äôs just that people are too worn out and torn after losing loved ones to fight you.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA Be careful FDA, I just said attorneys‚Äîhow many other persons are inclined to contact their attorneys right now and for healthcare damages/wrongful deaths? You have been escaping by the skin of your teeth‚Äîmany of your drugs are not helping others.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA FDA, does the the ‚ÄúF‚Äù in your acronym mean ‚ÄúFooling‚Äù? Does it? It cannot. As a matter of course, my attorneys are Ken Wright and Carsha Peters of Trinidad and Tobago.
Blame it on the FDA. Messing with people‚Äôs minds since the inception.@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA Just doing it FDA is not good enough. @TommyHilfigger you the man. Tommy is For the People. Tommy is for black people too. He‚Äôs for everybody. @TommyHilfigger. We are for people. Excellent Tommy. I could not think up that myself.
and when we want people to come for a big sale we can say ‚ÄúMake Haste!‚Äù. I like that, what about you Twitter?
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA How? Let people come alive, again‚Äîliterally. Let their spirit take flight. Like the song. @Nike Now, how about we change the closing sign on your doors to ‚ÄúNot Now‚Äù and the open sign to ‚ÄúNow‚Äù;
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA How are we supposed to build the world when everyone‚Äôs spirit is broken?
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA The living fire of my heart. Imagine how someone feels when their spirit is like that and they go to a med sci classroom, then they go to the FDA and they just meet people who are just doing it. Imagine that. It kills you. It breaks your spirit. It does.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA It‚Äôs like my breath, my thoughts, my actions, everything just comes together. My breath is the breath God breathes into me. I come alive. I am Born to Do it. YES! I am born to do it. Pure passion.  @Nike
I decided to Do it Now. When I think of medicine my whole body comes alive FDA; so I really can‚Äôt agree to Just do It! I have to Do it Now. @FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA @Nike
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA Don‚Äôt procrastinate; don‚Äôt just do it. Do it Now. Now. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm giving this to you; that‚Äôs the reason I can give this to you. I didn‚Äôt just do it.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA I sat there and I thought ‚Äúhow am I supposed to achieve all these things I mean to?‚Äù; then it hit me. @Nike
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA It has to be done like you want to do it. Now. We need to act like we want to do it. We have to Do it Now. FDA, when I think of medicine I come alive! I come alive. Do it Now, your tagline, it was my motto before I gave it to you.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA It‚Äôs either you love medicine FDA, or you don‚Äôt. You don‚Äôt Just do it. Act like you‚Äôre Born to do it. DO IT NOW. That‚Äôs what the world wants. Are you born to do it FDA? ‚ÄòCause the whole world‚Äôs wondering about more than your psychiatry drugs right now.
Do it Now, @Nike . Born to do it. Act like you‚Äôre born to do it. Serena acts like she‚Äôs born to do it. She does.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA Gender issues. Can you stand up for Serena, Nike? Do you mean anything with your brand; I‚Äôm not saying to show unfair preference in a match; I‚Äôm saying to make it fair and to encourage the right thing. Can you Do it Now? Tick.
The sexist slant I mean @Nike.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA Do you think the umpire thought those things of Serena? She wears your brand proudly @Nike. Are you going to help the world in a big way Nike? Nike. Can you be Now? How can an umpire do one of your athletes something like that and you just remain quiet.
Do you think they‚Äôd say it‚Äôs uncouth and that perhaps I am ill-bred @Nike?
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA Serena looks real hardworking @Nike‚Äîcan you Do it Now? Nike, if I called the FDA ‚Äúfucking thieves‚Äù, do you think I‚Äôd be removed from the good graces of society; do you think they‚Äôd say a woman should not say things like that?
Oops. Imagine what it‚Äôs like to be so hardworking, you call someone a thief and it goes sexist.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA the heck, just do it? FDA? @Nike? Just do it? That‚Äôs the laziest tagline in the world Nike. For lazy people. I am convinced your athletes are not lazy. Really hardworking.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA When I marry I do not want to just do it. It‚Äôs my wedding night and we start kissing at some place wherever and we just do it. Just do it? I want steamy romance. Man. We must be kissing like whoa and some part of my heart sings out ‚ÄúAt Last‚Äù;
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA @Nike Just do it FDA. Just mess with me FDA‚Äîwill you? Can you imagine a man wants to marry a woman, or they marry and they‚Äôre just doing it? Just doing it. Everything about the courtship and marriage is just do it. Just do it sweetheart. Just do it.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA Act like you‚Äôre born to do it. ‚ÄòCause if we tell them to Just do it, it feels like the meds they‚Äôre giving people now. We don‚Äôt want that. They‚Äôre just messing with people‚Äîyou know? Just do it.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA Can you really let them know they have to do better for the world? Nike, can you make them do it fast? People‚Äôs lives are at stake. We need action now. Can you be Now‚ÄîDo it Now? No longer @Nike. Now. Do it Now. Born to do it.
No one escapes @Adidas‚Äô three stripes, because you brand them with those stripes‚Äîyou do.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA @Adidas You‚Äôre giving them three stripes, they‚Äôd better get it done in three stripes. Can you mean something within the fashion industry Adidas? The clothing giant that gives them three stripes.
You are the brand with the three stripes, but the world does not know what those three stripes mean. They can mean three stripes and they‚Äôre out. You don‚Äôt tolerate nonsense @adidas
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA What about you @S_C_ ,  Jay-Z you think you can get the world to rock with this? Can you go even further? Can you rock the world with this? Rockafella. We rock you. Rock with it, FDA. @adidas , how about you? @adidasoriginals
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA I need you to stand up with me‚Äîbut by the very fact that you make clothing for differently abled people ought to show society your heart; that you see everybody; that you love everyone. This must upset you on some level Tommy.
@TommyHilfiger , when someone spread that bad rumour about you years ago, that you don‚Äôt make clothes for black people, many people continued believing it‚Äîeven after you addressed it. You need to stand up with me Tommy Hilfigger.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA You don‚Äôt want to be like my family. What do you say @TommyHilfiger , you make clothing for people with different abilities/physical disabilities; what do you say to the FDA?
‚Äúdisgrace to call me family‚Äù.
we‚Äôre not saying you‚Äôre getting it all wrong, some of your medicine works. To deny it is to be like my family, like my aunt, who sexually harassed me but denies it with her son Zin‚Äîwho aided and abetted her in sexual harassment, so much so that he stood up and said it is a
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA Something right within our society. We can‚Äôt tolerate someone denying the negative impact of these drugs‚Äî
People with families who sincerely love and care for each other need you to do the right thing. They need you to stand up for something good. @FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA @Nike athletes? Can you stand up for something like this? Will you stand up for this and hear the voices of people using these drugs? We are human being and human beings need the FDA to do the right thing.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA @Nike Just do it. Just do it. For lazy people. Nike, do you support pioneering work within the FDA? Tick? ‚ÄúX‚Äù? Which is it Nike? Nike wearers, what do you say?
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA @Nike, oh Nike, can you bring the ticks? Can you put two ticks across each other and give the FDA an ‚ÄúX‚Äù for the work they‚Äôve been doing? We don‚Äôt want the FDA to Just do it. That‚Äôs what gets us flatlined. Killed. Done. Just do it will not work here Nike.
Surely I will not be a single tick in your butt. @FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA I am even writing the poetry for symphonies right now, maybe one will be entitled Death in the FDA‚Äîand the lives they saved along way? Where are the cellos? Where are the violins? Where is my orchestra? A tick. In your butt. That‚Äôs me right now.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA No one in the world should stand for this, Trinidad and Tobago, FDA. I am intent on being that annoying tick in your behind that will not go away until you pull me out, treat the area and the irritation and everything that comes with it‚Äîw/ pioneering drugs
have you read my words to you? Please keep reading them‚Äîeven fast track to my last tweet; my life will be in danger when people realise how much money I‚Äôll be making. Oops. They‚Äôll make my neck crack with their knack for taking.
Honourable Justice Archie, Honourable @OPM_TT Prime Minister Rowley, Honourable Opposition Leader Kamla Persad Bissessar @MPKamla  he is intent on protecting persons involved in human trafficking by limiting the search parametres of lower ranking officers who cannot challenge him
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA but it seems like we intend to; because just as my family is bent on killing so is a very high ranking official within the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service because @TTPoliceService
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA We can‚Äôt make things like these the norm;
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA Dead as Zin Mark King‚Äôs fianc√© will be or could be because this attorney-at-law and very high ranking officer in the Coast Guard wishes to kill his fianc√© with his Coast Guard firearm.  @TTPoliceService @tv6tnt
This is Grey‚Äôs Anatomy and you‚Äôre George. License to kill. Dead. Really dead.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA You need to understand that what you give to human beings is not good enough. It is messing with them. When the FDA messes with you, when your doctor messes with you, that‚Äôs not so good. That‚Äôs flatline. Double o7. You dead.
you know nothing about human beings (I‚Äôm learning too, don‚Äôt take it too hard) and like your education is far from the humanities (as mine is far from the sciences, or music, go figure!).
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA He shared this as a story; but when I confirmed my interest in medicine I began asking him questions to understand as much of the picture as I could. It seems like you don‚Äôt listen to patients, like you were groomed entirely in the ape to man sciences,
normally; 4. and to intelligently distinguish/identify the problem area.
1. the marital context is important b/c it hopefully speaks of a frequency of sexual relations; 2. it is a place where the patient ought to have significant opportunity to understand the functioning of his body; 3. and to know if his reproductive organs/bladder are working
whom he has healthy sexual relations with:
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA It seems like the FDA/medicine does not care too much about patients; so you do not listen. You are not listening to people. In the case of my friend, the patient knew what ailed him because he was a married man, living with his wife,
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA I don‚Äôt give a duck. I don‚Äôt give two ducks either. As a matter of fact, I do not even give three ducks; it‚Äôs best I keep all my ducks in my pond, watch them wade or maybe have poultry for lunch. This doctor is Dr. Hazan Khan, of Trinidad and Tobago.
works wonders for prostate problems, but you did other patients) that you will hate every part of my guts the same way.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA I have never been to medical school, yet here I am stepping on toes. I am well aware that the same way you disliked this patient for the trouble he caused you when he reported you to Dr. Faud Khan, (so much so that you did not tell him sol palmetto
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA My friend (who I mentioned two paragraphs ago) was having problems urinating, so he visited the doctor. The doctor insisted that his issues were prostate related, while the patient resisted: he said it was a bladder issue.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA which liberates me to speak the truth and to speak my mind‚Äîwhat‚Äôs the point of being friends with people you can‚Äôt be real with?
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA I don‚Äôt care for that. People die when you don‚Äôt take responsibility for things, like this. 		I have questions about some doctors. Understand that I don‚Äôt really have too many friends and my family members do not like me,
In the spirit of great pioneers, what do you think FDA?  Now, I don‚Äôt care to hear ‚Äúno, we don‚Äôt do that‚Äù, the sort of ‚Äúdeny, deny, deny‚Äù nonsense Marrylane Smith-King schooled her son Zin Mark in.
The best way is one closest to nature, provided that it is taken in the right dosage. The ‚Äúhow‚Äù of this was what advanced my thoughts about mental health and the four R‚Äôs that I came up with. They may be absurb, but what do you think?
It‚Äôs just a matter of finding the thing that best penetrates the resistance built up by AIDS‚Äîwhat keeps AIDS strong within the body.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA If the virus has been there for years it may require a complete change of diet to foods that build the blood as it is being cleansed‚Äîthe body has to be strong as possible to fight. There are many ways of cleansing the blood, I think.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA  Thoroughly. I thought about it, brought all the ideas together and figured it must be about cleansing the blood.
but the focus in their recovery was cleansing the blood.@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA However, complete recovery from HIV/AIDS seems to be about thoroughly cleansing the blood. I read about someone‚Äôs complete recovery from AIDS (for the life of me I can‚Äôt recall where, pardon me for being unable to retrieve the article‚Äôs link);
in cases where the virus is in its later stage a more aggressive course of treatment is needed, but I think the plants can change anyone's immediate medical health.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA He administered this to someone and they are completely cured of HIV.  I wondered about this, the ‚Äúhow‚Äù. The leaves of the two plants work on the blood, and their response was favourable because the virus was in an early stage;
proposes the use of Moringa and Neem leaves as an alternative.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA In the case of HIV/AIDS, which affects the blood I realised that it is best for treatment to target the blood stream, that‚Äôs where it attacks. Treatments are already on the market (aren‚Äôt they?), but a good friend (who prefers to remain unknown)
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA Sour sup also soothes most people, so there is also the possibility of helping patients already having chemotherapy by relieving nausea, restlessness and weakness; what do you think? It may even have greater benefits than chemo‚Äîwho knows?
(directed along the interstitium); but everyone (in the Caribbean) knows cancer‚Äôs cure/treatment is the Sour Sup plant.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA FDA, many people are dying of cancer because your treatments don‚Äôt work. Where are your pioneers FDA? I will cry this cry until you give a resounding response. It demands another type of treatment‚Äîbut I will personally research cancer and marijuana
You need to be pioneers, FDA, so I am just going to give you most of my ideas/observations.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA Diversification is not only oil and gas; it‚Äôs not products that fall under the very same oil and gas. It is trying something new and expanding. Throw your weight here @drsanjaygupta‚Äîthis one is for the world of medicine.
and not to mix them up. How about our industry Trinidad and Tobago? We need to diversify our economy.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA This is important, because what I have realised is that different (species/plants?) have different effects; one kind gives clarity, another gives arousal‚Äîsome both? It is different. It is important you ask Jamaican farmers for the different types
medicine.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA That is not good FDA. It will serve the Jamaican government well if they only allow weed for medicine, or Jamaica will remain where it is, never getting better economically. Jamaica really has the best weed‚Äîit is weed I will purchase when I am studying
you.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA but opted to sacrifice me instead, ‚Äòcause I am friends with their ‚Äúenemies‚Äù and even stand up and call them ‚Äúland thieves‚Äù because they steal other people‚Äôs land. If you‚Äôre like my family I will become very concerned. Very very concerned; I will not trust
to the Lodge/secret society,
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA Please, give marijuana a real shot, don‚Äôt sideline people. Don‚Äôt push them out of society. Otherwise I‚Äôll think you‚Äôre like my family and especially like my aunt who with my cousin considered if they should sacrifice me or sacrifice his fianc√©
but the bad ones just seem to be doing a lot of ill. @FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA Yes FDA, I want Jamaica to get out of debt; Trinidad and Tobago marijuana growth may be a wonderful alternative for our economy; diversify. There must be some sincere people within the FDA, people who have worked very hard;
(Only for medicine Jamaica, don‚Äôt legalise it for everyone (it will flood your market and you will never get out of debt). @FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA Medical fraternity of the world, let me just say Jamaica has the best weed in the whole wide world, feel free to purchase medicinal marijuana from Jamaica.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA I‚Äôm saying to you FDA, that you need to be pioneers, or the world will come to know you as people killers‚ÄîI am still wondering which other fields of medicine/treatment you‚Äôre killing/messing with people in?
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA The worst case scenario is that nothing happens. If nothing comes of this, well, I‚Äôll keep trying when I study medicine. I know I‚Äôm meant to study Alzheimer‚Äôs, so one little setback will not deter me.
I'm not used to tweeting threads, and I think this one probably went all wrong, @FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA, please come to my profile and read what I've been sending to you.
Liquid injections I would do on myself if I had Alzheimer‚Äôs (please don‚Äôt make anything go wrong within me that I‚Äôll need to cure myself God); it‚Äôs marijuana, it‚Äôs safe once used well.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA I‚Äôm not saying to go around injecting marijuana directly into the brain of everyone with Alzheimer‚Äôs. I‚Äôm saying it is worth a good try using marijuana. A meaningful effort.
I‚Äôm not saying to go around injecting marijuana directly into the brain of everyone with Alzheimer‚Äôs. I‚Äôm saying it is worth a good try using marijuana. A meaningful effort.
I will only say marijuana has amazing effects for cognitive processes. Crystal clear clarity. Ask people who have smoked/ingested marijuana before; let them tell you about the drug; let them relay their experiences in all their time of smoking/using marijuana.
Studies are concerned with marijuana stunting growth in adolescents, and long term effects of their brains (from smoking); I don‚Äôt know what the case may be here.
It‚Äôs just that she was so arrogant that she did not care for the thoughts of anyone else. The things were silly. Like the use of many kitchen towels when I did not use any (or I used one). This kept up for years. Always wrongful blame.
She always blamed me for things I did not do. Always.
Now, she is a spiteful, hateful and malicious woman, but that action was different from what I‚Äôd previously observed in her. Another time I told her something, and within minutes she had completely forgotten‚Äîas in she had no idea that I said what I did. Complete forgetting.
She was erratic and her actions seemed like those of someone whose head had had too much to hold.
I‚Äôm the only one who knows, but with her it seemed to borderline a glimpse of dementia/senility. Allow me to share a brief anecdote. One day she turned on a tap and let out all the water from the storage tanks then ran to every one of her friends and her son saying that I did it.
Like I said, I have only observed one person with Alzheimer‚Äôs, and she does not even know she has Alzheimer‚Äôs.
There are some people who actually love their families (most people, I think‚ÄîI HOPE) and will never hurt a hair on their heads; to them, this is important. I think for restoration or regeneration to happen diet as well as exercise is critical.
Understand that I am sharing my ideas with you, because it just seems like you‚Äôre taking too long to do anything and people are losing their loved ones in the process.
It seems to me that the brain of a patient with Alzheimer‚Äôs has degenerated (if we are using the word to mean the same thing), which is why it looks the way it does‚Äîmarijuana injections directly into the brain may give some sort of relief. Real relief.
but something like Alzheimer‚Äôs which is major must be treated differently.
Now, I think mental disabilities are like music or music theory‚Äîwhich I know nothing about, and must school myself on. I think they operate on a scale. A very minor disability can be easily treated with a bit of marijuana administered anywhere in the body,
Rubber ducky, rubber ducky, I may look young, but I‚Äôm plucky; I‚Äôll make you do the rubber ducky if you don‚Äôt listen to me.
Have you messed with other people‚Äôs minds so much that the karma has come back to mess with yours? You are messing with people FDA. Careful it doesn‚Äôt make you go all nuts about a rubber ducky.
Medicine is like life, it evolves (not like Darwin, heaven forbids if medicine evolved from apes to humans), medicine ought to; you cannot expect to give the same messing drugs for nearly half a dang century.
I am aware of Ban 2401, and very, very, very, very briefly of the work of Dr. Sanjay Gupta‚Äîhe preaches on the pulpit now about marijuana, he didn‚Äôt before; in fact he says he was very much against it; perhaps you ought to look into his work; maybe that will convince you a bit.
Finances are being gained from these drugs, FDA. The world knows that. To my thinking marijuana seems well for ‚Äòminor‚Äô mental disabilities; but I have been thinking about other mentalities/disabilities as well. Bear with me. I lived with a relative who I believe has Alzheimer‚Äôs.
My point is, you cannot write off people from society with the drugs you give them. Drugs are meant to help people, not mess with them. You are messing with people‚Äôs lives. You do. And you know it. It is a disappointment if this is for financial gain.
That is a must; we expect it, or I‚Äôll take to singing about a cat and a fiddle and I will have you jumping over the moon. The little dog will laugh, but I‚Äôll keep the dish with the spoon‚Äîpeople need to eat healthy too.
This is proven. I proved it. It is only up to you to do something about this. Yes, yes, I know, trials etc., temper the pioneering spirit.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA People‚Äôs minds are not theirs when they take your current drugs‚Äîyou make bad matters worse, or perhaps I should say worst. Marijuana is the answer. It is the key. It is every-dang-thing; smoke ze weed, or inject it‚ÄîI joke! Marijuana is the answer.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA I experimented w/ insanity and with marijuana and I think it is a ripe avenue for mental health research; this drug can give patients the clarity that your psychiatry/mental health drugs do not give to them.Marijuana is the breakthrough for mental health.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA I am going out of my head, wherever is my mind? FDA, I have brought marijuana and mental health into the same sentence for you.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA Oopsy doopsy! FDA poopsy! FDA great and mighty in the sky, whatever‚Äôs that above you in the sky; you‚Äôd better listen or it will make you say bye!
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA Crystal clear clarity‚Äîyou know those cable/direct tv/ ads where they‚Äôre very concerned about the quality of the broadcast? Just like that. Compare this to your current mental health drugs that only fog, fog and mess with people‚Äôs minds.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA What I also observed is that it gives mental clarity. Actual crystal clear perception. Clearer than a crystal ball.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA One, it arouses you. This is not something you want to interfere with in the drug. It is a normal bodily trait. Sex is also a normal function. This is fine within marijuana/drugs.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA I experimented with marijuana, briefly‚Äîbriefly, briefly, very briefly, and I observed some things about it.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA People lie in hospital beds and die of cancer and every other ailment because the heart of the FDA is not at one with the pioneering spirit‚Äîwhich can be equally dangerous to people‚Äôs wellbeing if it is not tempered. Hear me, hear me;
you‚Äôre sidelining them in society. @FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA and why are you doing this; and since money is at the root of everything, who is benefitting financially from this? You cannot let people look like they‚Äôre ready to jump down a rabbit hole‚Äîas I am certain I looked when I took those drugs;
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA My other question‚Äîwhich is a tangent, but a relevant tangent‚Äîis which other fields/areas of medicine are also being messed over by you;
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA We are human beings, we ought to care for each other‚Äîsincerely. You have an ethical responsibility to people. Why are you messing with the people in this world?
as my dear aunt Marrylane Smith-King and her son Zin Mark King sacrificed me)? @FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA Are none of your relatives taking these drugs (presuming that you‚Äôre the normal kind of people who treat your relatives well and never ever entertain the thought of sacrificing them‚Äîto the Lodge or some other secret society,
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA My question to you is why are you knowingly messing with people‚Äôs lives? Are you interns on the first day of medical school? Why do you insist on messing with people?
You are the Food and Drug Administration. You must know this. You have to know this. Except that you are so irresponsible you do not know what your drugs do? @FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA On the average day 7 or 8 persons out of 10 talk about just how terrible the drugs make them feel; on a good day 6 persons; of course there are few, the 1s or 2s, who thankfully come through okay. Thank God. But that‚Äôs the minority.
a little more and I would‚Äôve needed to take a maxi on the Priority Bus Route and tell them to drop me off at platform 9 and ¬æ. @FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA They mess people up. Seriously. I was completely normal, and I felt messy. Like messed up. Higher than an overdosing disoriented‚Ä¶person‚Äîhowever those people feel;
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA I have also asked around about these drugs and in the great spirit of pioneers I dived a thousand leagues under the sea and I took the drugs for two weeks.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDAThis conference was an eye opener for me. Persons with mental health issues/different mentalities who have been taking the drugs usually prescribed stood up and talked about their experiences. For the most part their responses were not very favourable.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA FDA, I also attended a scholarly conference at the University of the West Indies, St. Augustine campus, which is in Trinidad, in my country Trinidad and Tobago. See the link to find out details about the conference: https://t.co/NKHfoj7y7w.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA but all in all I insanity just leaves you winded and very much in need of a good seat to sit on, your favourite drink and favourite food; and somewhere quiet where I can finish my book!
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA I experimented with madness/insanity; I have no words to describe it‚Äîother than perhaps as ‚Äútoo much‚Äù, even ‚Äúhead spinning‚Äù; phrases along those lines...
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA One of the things I find interesting is that madness/mental illness is a point of perception; a point of perception that can be accessed at will if one is able to move their body to that place and also return from that point of madness/insanity.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA Now, I have read a lot over my lifetime (I‚Äôm 28)‚Äînot everything I should have, but a lot all the same. And I have met quite a few interesting things in my readings.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA  50 years? That‚Äôs half a century. That‚Äôs half a person‚Äôs life time‚Äîor it should be.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA It is important to be honest, FDA;  especially when someone bangs on your door in the Wagnerian manner that I‚Äôm. Where are your pioneers? What are they doing? Is everyone mental in Psychiatry? The world has gone fifty years without any real innovation?
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA but in cases like that you ought to at least offer society viable alternatives.
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA I am willing to wager that I am not the only one concerned about what you do‚Äîor perhaps I should say what you do not do. It is common knowledge that everyone‚Äôs body is different, that drugs that work on one person may not necessarily work on someone else;
medicine in over fifty years‚Äîover, fifty years, that‚Äôs with a five and a zero as you well know.  https://t.co/c8znJ3061Z 	My concern is the lack of innovation  in the medical/pharmaceutical industry
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA am not exactly mainstream, but I think I fit into society just fine; I am a scholar who is currently on a break from my M.Phil in Literatures in English.FDA, I am certain you are well aware that there has been no breakthrough in mental health/psychiatry

how to choose).  I am also an artist, at the moment I am writing; it was my intent to have my writing open the financial doors to singing/painting/medicine, and with that a gateway to you. But I  realize that it  would be beyond selfish for me to withhold what I am about to give
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDA I need to tell you a little bit about myself  so that you understand what I will say a few tweets from now. I intend to be a medical (missionary) doctor, a cardiologist (I say cardio, but really, I find so many things/areas interesting that I  am not sure
@FDA_Drug_Info, @US_FDAI also ask you and every reader around the world for patience that lasts much more than five 280 character tweets‚Äîbecause I also intend to make a crime report to the government, opposition and judiciary of my country, Trinidad and Tobago.
