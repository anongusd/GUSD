The Republican debate was really two debates in one--Trump v. Cruz, and those two vs. all the others. My take:  https://t.co/XJrm6Tvo4R
Trump closing statement pretty simple: "We will win on everything we do" if he is elected. Pretty sweeping as campaign promises go.
Christie in closing statement sticks to his pattern, goes directly after Obama.

Cruz knows that framing the campaign finance question as a fight with the NY Times he makes it harder for anybody else on stage to raise.
Trump managed to throw $19 trillioin in debt into an immigration answer.
Rubio took a few questions to crank up to warp speed at some earlier debates. Not this one.
Kasich, asked about market turmoil, responds by essentially saying balancing the budget will create jobs.

The question to Trump:How did the lenders and workers come out in your bankruptcies? Not really addressed.
Ted Cruz had a very good opening act in this debate.
This is not a Trump-centric debate, to say the least.
Whoa. Jeb Bush goes after his former protege, Marco Rubio, for skipping Senate votes, says he should resign if he's not going to vote.

One debate winner Wednesday night: RNC chair @Reince Priebus, who pushed behind the scenes to get @CarlyFiorina on stage.
GOP candidates got to talk substance instead of only Donald in the debate; they took it, esp. Fiorina and Rubio.  http://t.co/27KNj62Gyl
This was the debate where attitude met substance; substance held its own, and more. My take:  http://t.co/27KNj62Gyl via @WSJ
Christie giving the same good answer he gives on drug rehab when he's asked about drug abuse in New Hampshire.
Jeb Bush's best disarming moment in 2 debates: I smoked marijuana in high school. My mom isn't happy I just admitted it before 25 m. people.
Um, there's half an hour to go.
Marco Rubio hasn't had many openings in this debate, but he has seized them pretty well.
Trump on immigrants: "The good ones will come back" after they are deported.
Lots of good moments in this debate so far, but the Fiorina comeback on Trump comment on her appearance tops the first hour.
You can feel the other candidates relishing the chance not to talk about Donald Trump. Oh, and about policy.
Rubio and Fiorina seized the chance to actually talk the substance of foreign policy.
Marco Rubio must be wondering what happened to him tonight.
Bush on Trump: He's the one guy who gave money and tried to get something for it--casino gambling in Florida.
Fiorina on why insiders don't get it: "A fish swims in water. It doesn't know it's water."
Bush decides not to go after Trump on leading the world, but rather Obama. Then, though, notes you can't "insult" leaders around the world.
Carly Fiorina misses not a second to get the secretary-to-CEO bio fact on the record.
Bobby Jindal really IS positioning himself as the outsider. He's skipping the candidates' group photo, apparently.
In his closing remarks, Santorum attempts to both cite his long Washington experience and say he'd be an outsider if elected.
I'm guessing Bobby Jindal won't be invited to a Senate Republican caucus lunch any time soon.
Lindsey Graham: "There's nobody left in Syria to train."
Lindsey Graham is, so far, on record in favor of Marbury v. Madison and more drinking at day's end in Washington.
Bobby Jindal throws Chief Justice Roberts under the bus.
Wow, we actually got to Marbury v. Madison in this debate.
Pataki says he would have fired Kim Davis, the Kentucky clerk who refused to issue gay marriage licenses.
Well, this at least proves that it's easier to have a real debate with four candidates than with 10.
Prediction: Every question on the Syrian refugee crisis tonight will be turned into a critique of Obama policy on Syria.
Lindsey Graham is turning this into a real debate, single-handed.
Shouldn't someone note that birthright citizenship is in the Constitution?
Lindsey Graham goes straight to the question some avoid: Put ground troops on the ground in Syria AND Iraq to fight the Islamic State.
Three questions on Trump and counting. Zero on anything else.
Lindsey Graham opens the homage to Reagan phase of the early debate...there will be more.

An awesome recap of last night's debate in four charts: http://t.co/Eun8lq7E3g
Trump closes by saying we can't do anything right in America..Not exactly an optimistic note.
Jeb Bush is trying to sound presidential while standing next to Donald Trump who says there isn't time for that sort of thing.
Chris Christie pushing hard on his call to actually reform entitlements.
Jeb Bush has been waiting a long time to give this answer on Common Core at a Republican debate.
Now Trump isn't answering the question of why he once supported a single-payer government health system.
Bret Baier hits Trump on his past support for a single-payer government health system.
If you thought the national security divide between Paul and others in the party, the fight with Christie just obliterated it.
Christie to Paul: When you're sitting in a subcommittee blowing hot air..Paul to Christie: You fundamentally misunderstand the Constitution
Rubio notes most immigrants coming in now are not from Mexico but from Central America. Also could have said from Asia, increasigly.
So, Trump just said the Mexican government is smarter than the American government.
Trump actually says nobody was talking about immigration until he raised it. Jeb Bush will be surprised at that.
Jeb Bush standing firm behind his position for giving immigrants a path to legal status.
OK, so Kasich got his Ohio economic statistics in there as well, first question out of the obx.
Kasich not backing off in the least from his decision to expand Medicaid. The compassionate conservative approach defended...
The governors--Bush and Christie--came armed with their state budget and jobs figures, that's for sure. Haven't even heard from Walker yet.
Trump show already is out there in full glory. A question about demeaning women and an answer about unpolitical correctness like no other.
Rubio turns his student loans into an asset--sign of an average guy who understands average folks.
Rubio's introduction to presidential debates is an invitation to attack his fellow Floridian, Jeb Bush. He is declining the honor.
Wow, a real debate already, between Rand Paul and Donald Trump.
Lindsey Graham turns a question about a war on women into an answer about Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria.
Fiorina: She will put "America back in the leadership business" by challenging Iran's supreme leader.
Santorum doing a pretty good job of delivering his Republican/blue-collar economics mix.
Carly Fiorina closes out a coherent answer on homeland security by saying tech companies should cooperate with the government on security.
OK, so in the first commercial break there's a Hewlett-Packard commercial. What does that tell you about the Carly Fiorina campaign?
Lindsey Graham isn't messing around: Says there need to be more American troops on the ground in Iraq, AND in Syria.
Carly Fiorina casually notes that Trump has changed his positions on amnesty, health care and abortion.
Perry actually is free to tee off on Trump without having to worry about him hitting back because he isn't around yet. So he does.
Jindal and Pataki both chose to give their opening statement, without particular regard to the question asked.
Lindsey Graham is the first to go directly after Hillary Clinton--and spending billions to buy oil from "people who hate our guts."
Rick Santorum, in 1st answer in  debate, cleverly notes he was even further back four years ago before winning a string of states.
RT @PoliticoCharlie: That so-called kiddie/JV/happy hour debate? it will feature 4 former/current governors, 2 former/current senators and …

Obama's Iran speech and a later conversation show the Iraq war debate isn't over, and may never be: http://t.co/WUrrieuZoO via @WSJ
Obama in post-speech conversation says some Iraq war proponents "are entirely unapologetic about the results." http://t.co/WUrrieuZoO
In post-speech conversation, Obama expands on his argument there's a "mindset" that prefers military force. http://t.co/WUrrieuZoO via @WSJ
OK, #Nationals fans, it's now officially embarrassing. We are pitching out backup first baseman.
Um, #Nationals fans, is it time to get discouraged yet?
Is it possible this speech would have been useful to give the country heading into nuclear talks with Iran rather than coming out of it?
It doesn't appear that Obama is going to let any criticism of the Iran nuclear deal go unanswered in this speech.
This speech would make an interesting op-ed piece. Or several.
Obama: "I've ordered military action in seven countries. There are times when force is necessary."
Obama goes there in his Iran speech: Ultimately it's a choice between the deal and war, at least eventually.
Best to view Obama's Iran-deal speech as an effort to cement Democratic support and give his allies material to defend the agreement.
Wondering whether Obama will get around to mentioning this week's reasonably positive (at least publicly) reaction by Persian Gulf arabs..
@JeffreyGoldberg Hmmmm....
Obama using figure $56 billion as amount of money Iran will get access to under the nuke deal. Critics say $100 or $150 billion.
Obama: By killing the Iran deal, Congress would not only pave Iran's move toward a nuclear bomb, it would accelerate it.
Obama: The ban on Iran having a nuclear weapon is "permanent." First SALT agreement by contrast lasted five years.
Obama: Iran deal strongest non-proliferation agreement ever negotiated.
In his Iran speech, Obama is selling the deal and going after its critics in equal measure.
Obama: Critics who said interim deal with Iran wouldn't work now say it was so successful it's a reason not to sign a comprehensive deal.
Obama notes that the single biggest beneficiary of the Iraq was was Iran, which saw its biggest enemy eliminated.
Obama: More than a decade later, we still live with the consequences of the decision to invade Iraq.
In his Iran speech, Obama criticizes a "mindset" that prefers military action to diplomacy, saying it produced the Iraq war.

Ten Key Lines From Netanyahu’s Speech Before Congress http://t.co/1YfkIbTm0L via @WSJPolitics
Thought: Does such a big Netanyahu plea to ditch the deal in any way increase pressure on Obama to show US independence by getting one?
RT @JacksonDiehl: Netanyahu is basically making the case that Iran must be sanctioned and contained until there is regime change in Tehran
The administration's basic problem with Netanyahu's speech will be his simple, flat assertion that a better deal could be negotiated,.
Money line from Netanyahu speech: "This is a bad deal. It's a very bad deal. We're better off without it."
Netanyahu has said both that Iran's regime won't change, and that nuclear restrictions should stay in place until it does.
Key moment in Netanyahu's speech will come when he says what he thinks the alternative is to an Iran deal.
Netanyahu's description of proposed deal immediately differs from Obama''s: Would still have"vast" infrastructure, "short" breakout time.
Netanyahu attempts indirectly to to undercut the idea that Rouhani represents a more moderate Iran: "Iran's regime is as radical as ever."
In his speech, Netanyahu pursuing an obvious strategy of describing Iran's government before talking about its nuclear program.
Netanyahu says Iran has "goons in Gaza, lackeys in Lebanon" doing its bidding.
Netanyahu throws olive branch to Obama by saying at the top that he has done a lot for Israel.
Netanyahu says "never my intention" for his speech to become a political controversy.
