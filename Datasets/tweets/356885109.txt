Thankfully, Dems elected to statewide office in '17 &amp; '18 have already begun working to implement voting rights initiatives &amp; ballot measures in VA, NV, MI, NY, &amp; NJ. States are the 1st line of defense against a Trump judiciary that has no interest in protecting our voting rights
2020: Cuts to early voting, voter roll purges, polling location closures in minority nghbrhoods, outrageous reg. deadlines, exact match rules, etc are all plays in the voter suppression playbook that disproportionately affect PoC, students, &amp; the elderly aka the Dem party's base
Democrats who were elected governor in '17 &amp; '18 are already working to bolster and expand the civil rights of ppl targeted by Republican voter suppression over the years and that to me is one of the most overlooked outcomes of the last cycle #2020Election
According to a U of Wisconsin study, up to 23K+ ppl in just 2 counties were deterred from voting in 2016 due to Wisconsin's voter id law. In a state that Trump won by just 22k, these Republican voter suppression tactics can make a difference #2020election https://t.co/t8vxUD9fwo
2020: Repubs have been saying the quiet parts out loud for years re: voter suppression strategy. WI's Repub AG and Rep. Grothman (R-WI) both suggested state's voter ID law suppressed Dem turnout in '16 (Grothman said same thing in 2011 in support of the law) #2020Election

Which part of ‚Äúexit polls suck‚Äù is confusing. To quote the AP: ‚ÄúHowever, news organizations have long held concerns about the accuracy of exit polls, which have . . .tended to overstate Democrats. In 2016, for example, they incorrectly suggested that Clinton would defeat Trump.‚Äù
6) But if there was any doubt that the GOP is now the party of Trump, Republican messaging was all about sanctuary cities/immigration in closing days of the #Midterms2018 .
5) Interesting stat: For an election driven by Trump, mentions of Trump appear in less than 10% of TV ads.
4) GOP learned the hard way that taking health care away from people isn't popular. Dems highlighted this bad GOP policy and mentioned ‚Äúpre-existing conditions‚Äù in nearly a quarter of TV ads.
3) GOP increased TV ads on health care by 50% after 10/1. Clearly polling showed they needed to respond to attacks. 2x spike on GOP mention of ‚Äúpre-existing conditions.‚Äù
2) Democrats clearly on offense on health care-- Dems mentioned healthcare more than 1.5x more than GOP in TV ads.
1) When looking at TV ads, top topics by party--	Republicans: taxes, economy, "liberals" and Nancy Pelosi, healthcare, jobs, and immigration	Democrats: healthcare, taxes, the economy, pre-existing conditions specifically, and Social Security/Medicare

POTUS brilliantly uses Declaration of Independence to eviscerate Trump. #MasterClass
Bill Clinton was "explainer in chief" in '12. Obama staking claim to "persuader in chief" in this one.
Obama uses humor to hit Trump, much more effective than some Dems who are hindered by anger and venom.
