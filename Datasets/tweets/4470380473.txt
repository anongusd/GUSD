@markitgeek @KatieFalkenberg @latimes @latimesphotos @CityMalibu I absolutely understand + relate to that! I think we have to remember that there will always be someone worse off. There’s issues we’re fighting here in the US that people can’t even comprehend bc they’re still fighting for basic rights. Still gotta fight for them though ❤️
@markitgeek @KatieFalkenberg @latimes @latimesphotos @CityMalibu Pretty sure if your house had burned down regardless of how much money you had you wouldn’t care what kind of boat brought you supplies 🤦🏽‍♀️
@markitgeek @KatieFalkenberg @latimes @latimesphotos @CityMalibu I think maybe you’re looking at aid in the wrong way / you’re saying if a rich person is in a burning house they shouldn’t call the fire department? People have died, and the amount of money they had when that happened does not equal the value of their life.
@markitgeek @KatieFalkenberg @latimes @latimesphotos @CityMalibu And regardless, lives are at stake. Why would the amount of money they have impact whether or not they deserve help? Have some empathy.
@markitgeek @KatieFalkenberg @latimes @latimesphotos @CityMalibu You realize that I said they've donated right?? Meaning they actually are helping by paying for these supplies as well.. and again, people have died, animals have died, there are farmers that have still been working through this, farmers that are clearly not millionaires..
@JcindyinA 100%

All this to say - we work within our communities but we also need to work outside of them. 👏		If my conversation w him gives us 1 more person that defends OUR lives &amp; OUR rights, then my 20 failed conversations have been worth it. 		Let’s not give up on everyone just yet.
It made me have hope for turning people blue. 		He’s a white male from an upper middle class family. 		He mightve been bullshitting (although personally I think he took it to heart). 		He told me how frustrating it was to hear so much stupidity come from people he knows so well.
Actually - I don’t think he voted or supports trump vocally. But I think the fact that most of his community does is enough to qualify (if you don’t use your voice and your not stepping up for people you’re still making a statement to who and what you support).
However - all of his values are clear, he believes victims, he stands up to guys being jerks, he protests when he hears racist comments. HE brought up Kavanaugh and immigration. 		It’s the first time I’ve had a rational conversation with a trump supporter since 45 was elected.
I had a few *surprisingly* great conversations with someone who’s family is republican and most of his friends are republican and trump supporters - he grew up surrounded by it. I’d say to a certain extent, it’s all he knows. 		👇🏼

Seems like men that have assaulted women are actively sharing and vocally supporting #CancelKavanugh to keep them innocent in the public eye. 😠
When the hell does that start happening bc I’ve just about had enough.		The scars freakin hurt &amp; right now they hurt more than normal.		But seeing men that DID this *vocally* support women disgusts me.		We can be brave enough to share our pain &amp; once again they are cowards.
So we (women) are sharing stories of abuse &amp; assault.		Men are supporting them &amp; saying #BelieveWomen right?		But those men that are sharing AND have done this to women they “care” about aren’t coming forward.
@kateyrich Indian food 🤷‍♀️😍
Can we make something fucking clear to republicans complaining about “family reputation”.		#Kavanaugh is the one who’s reputation is destroyed, this is just another way men put their fucking issues on women and children. ENOUGH. #KavanughHearings
To the men that have done this to women and walk among us every day and still have the audacity to be vocal - we see you too.
For every moment myself + millions of women around the world have felt that we are not heard... Today is big. I can’t think of a single woman I know that doesn’t live w this pain every day. For the men that are being VOCAL, we see you. For the men that are NOT, we also see you.

@muffyislove88 Miami? I have so much love for that city but haven’t spent enough time to know what the dating scene is like.
@muffyislove88 Im just here for a week but when I used to live here it was weird haha. BUT I will say it’s really easy to meet people at bars!
@muffyislove88 Yeah I like meeting people in person more too. It just happens. The more I see people use apps the more closed off they seem to real opportunities 🤷‍♀️		Both are totally fine though. I understand that I’m extremely extroverted and it has to be a lot tougher if you’re not.
Dating comes up a lot when you’re traveling full time.		It’s def weird. But I love meeting people so it hasn’t been too difficult. 		I’ve heard from a lot of people that they feel more comfortable meeting someone on a dating app then going out or meeting IRL.		You?❤️

@ltvsquad Glad to hear it!! It’s crazy to me because I’m not even working at finding a relationship (I’m quite happy being single right now) and yet I often run into this issue (after having two relationships that started with huge lies).
@ltvsquad Not sure I’m capable of doing rigorous screening but i do need to be better at not giving people more chances after they’ve lied already.
@ltvsquad Honestly that’s a good point. I like to think the best of people I give them too many chances sometimes.
Can someone please explain to me why the guys that seem to be genuinely into me are 90% of the time in a relationship? 		And then explain to me why I keep falling for their BS and don't see the signs until it's too late?		😬🤦🏽‍♀️😑

8. I challenge all of us (including myself) to do better. To be involved. To fight. To know about these things when it happens and NOT when it goes viral. Stay present. Stay engaged. 		#KeepingFamiliesTogether
7. But how else are we working on making a difference?		Are you learning about how policies like these get put into place? Are you working on the ground? Are you thinking of running for office? How are YOU making direct change and not just making noise?
6. And there are so many people working on making a difference, and it’s still happening.		Social media allows us to share our voice and share causes and know we have support. It gives us a chance to stand up for those that have no voice.		This voice is powerful.
5. This issue has been happening for a long time. It doesn’t matter who’s to blame. The man keeping it going makes claims to change. But we all know what that really means since he’s always full of shit. The issue is it’s happening.
4. Can you imagine the amount of trauma these children will live with for the rest of their lives?		The issues they’ll have with separation and love?		The amount of fear they’ll have for authority figures?
3. This is something my mother has spoken to me about, how scared she was. This is something I think about quite often, it made me afraid of authority figures.		These were FEARS. We were never separated.		The fact that I was traumatized and my mother feared for our safety.
2. Being Mexican American, as a child, there were times when I was traveling internationally with my mother, and people didn’t believe that I was her child because of my blond hair. They thought I was a white kid, and this brown woman had taken me.
1. My heart is crushed right now with the state of this freakin country.		I can’t focus. 		Life is bigger than this. But right now. For many children, there is no thought of what the future might look like.		#KeepingFamiliesTogether

@marchaprilaudio But honestly when I lived in LA it’s just as constructed. “Why should I know you and what can you do for me” only difference is in LA people fake try - at least here they just cut to the chase.
@marchaprilaudio Aww man so true!! Yesterday we went to a restaurant and by the time we left the owner was giving us hugs and asking if she could post us on their social. They just don’t get as many real interactions. It’s all about what you can get and what can you give!
@marchaprilaudio This is me all day long. If I could I’d talk to everyone haha! But also I just spent six months in Mexico and Central America where everything moves so much slower so we have time do this this!
