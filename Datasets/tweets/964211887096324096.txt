In canada 124 Flaggers WERE HIT while wearing HiViz gear and holding their sign in the last 10 years. 27k work zone crashes in texas ,2011-16 work zone crashes went +75% in Nebraska, In 2015 .In the US there were 700 killed and 35K injured in work zone crashes ????
There is Tons of data showing showing the Number of road work zone crashes and resulting deaths,injuries, Sadly It is much harder to find info on School crossing zone Incidents. So here are some damn Scary numbers
@YourTrafficCop Do your school crossing guards have these flashing beauties? Data shows across Canada 124 road flaggers were hit wearing high vis vest AND holding UP their signs.
