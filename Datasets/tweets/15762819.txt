@MattJKoe @AOC @IWV I don't think that's what she meant. It's where that kind of thought process leads though. We can agree to disagree :)
@MattJKoe @AOC @IWV When you live in a world where there actually are policies like this, and you have people in office (in the US) who want government to run our entire lives, it's not insane to be worried about it becoming policy on the table someday
@MattJKoe @AOC @IWV It may not be a policy proposal now but she's bringing up some crazy stuff. I could see someone bringing it up someday. There are some extremists make their way into office and she's one of them.
@MattJKoe @AOC @IWV I get it but...let's take care of the earth &amp; combat climate change w/o resorting to this question...which rings of a potential future where legislators could try to regulate how many children you have as a matter of policy for the good of the earth
I get tired of saying the media is biased but GOOD GRACIOUS, they don't even *try* not to be. https://t.co/IGd1Ax2Cav
@MattJKoe @AOC @IWV I think even entertaining the question is on shaky ground. It starts somewhere.
It‚Äôs hard to grapple with this but we can think outside the box and do what ultimately works even if it seems counterintuitive. I need to do more research, but can see myself supporting it. https://t.co/t1WHaheSjr

@RealKiraDavis @BillyHallowell @AmericanAir I spent a total of $1100 for one flight to and one from DC. My original ticket was like $300. Okay I'll stop complaining now :)
@RealKiraDavis @BillyHallowell @AmericanAir It should be a pop up notification. And I even spoke with them on the phone and they didn't tell me BEFORE any of it.
RT @roddreher: This is a profound moral wrong, and should not be forgotten. https://t.co/dq20JgSDOf
I think this is a good perspective from @jamiewellsmd https://t.co/GHfFtxcZ29
@BillyHallowell @AmericanAir If they had just let me switch to an earlier flight on Wednesday, none of this would have happened. Instead, I had to buy new ticket only to find out the flight was half full and they could have switched me easily. There were seats galore available. So livid.
So @AmericanAir refused to offer any refund for their bad comms. Deciding between airlines? Know that AA doesn't value their long-time customers who have spent many thousands $$$ w/them. Will not help if a problem arises &amp; plenty of seats available. 0 respect for this company.
Yes! https://t.co/VsSr3IvAxO
@AmericanAir sent DM just now. Thank you.
Important piece from @NaomiSRiley.@POTUS spoke about protecting faith-based foster care agencies specifically yesterday at #NationalPrayerBreakfast. They serve nearly half a million children. We MUST protect their religious liberty for these children. https://t.co/v4eNvy1yom
On that note, if you saw a lady crying in the airport today, it was probably me. It was so frustrating and upsetting. I know it's "just money" but I was just shocked and felt taken advantage of by the airline. I also cry very easily but, just...rough start to the day...
If @AmericanAir doesn't issue a refund for one of the tickets, I will not use them anymore and switch airlines, which I do not want to do. But they will leave me no choice.
Also note, when I called AA originally about switching to an earlier flight, they did NOT tell me anything about my flight home being cancelled if I booked another ticket there. I've now paid over $1,000 for these tickets, when I should have never been charged for the extra 2
I arrive for my flight home today and find out my flight back was cancelled b/c I didn't take the original flight there. They then inform I must purchase ANOTHER $375 ticket to get home even though tickets ARE available for the flight, which I'd already previously paid for.
I had to purchase a full new ticket to get into the city early. My plane was nearly empty on the flight I bought a new ticket for, showing they could have easily switched me, a loyal customer &amp; AA advantage rewards member at no cost. Instead, I had to buy a $375 new ticket.
1) I hate to complain about companies on social media but this is my only resource b/c they wouldn't help me. @AmericanAir, where I've been a loyal customer with monthly trips for YEARS, triple charged me for one trip. After not being able to switch to an earlier flight...
@kurtimus @realDonaldTrump Plenty to disagree with regarding this and late term abortion in general but let‚Äôs table it
How had I never seen @christomlin before? Awesome multiple appearances at events this week! https://t.co/U8CYltcBYu
@kurtimus @realDonaldTrump I don't say "baby killer." But the infanticide line is to do strictly with late term abortions on viable babies, especially the situation going on with Northam, where he said a baby would be kept "comfortable" if born alive while a decision was made. That is literally infanticide
@kurtimus @realDonaldTrump Questioning whether or not we "care" about infant mortality is disingenious. The answer is an affirmative "yes." There may be a disconnect, considering even I didn't realize this was a trend. People have no idea. Certainly something I will look into more.
.@RealKiraDavis is amazing :) https://t.co/u2xL4UEHLX
@kurtimus @realDonaldTrump can't say I know the answer to that, but I don't think it negates or takes away from prolifers genuine concern for all human life, including these precious lives lost in these states. Of course that is also tragic and horrifying.
@kurtimus @realDonaldTrump Hmm interesting. I found a map and it sounds like you are right that red states have higher infant mortality rates. It appears they are states that have more poverty and rural areas than other states...I certainly agree this is a problem with access to good maternal care
@kurtimus @realDonaldTrump Can you send data in this? I just want to see it because I‚Äôve not heard it before. I am interested in learning more about it.
I‚Äôm glad @realDonaldTrump keeps this front and center. I don‚Äôt care what you think about him. This isn‚Äôt about him ‚Äî but his advocacy matters for *them.* https://t.co/bLmUFoVR10

But really, I need to go to bed, Mr. President. I really am getting up at 3:45. Ugh.
@kurtimus @kelseyjharkness and it's not "pretending" to care about babies. It's GENUINELY caring about babies. You are disrespecting our authenticity in believing in life before birth by saying that.

@JessicaThinkies @kelseyjharkness @womensmarch @March_for_Life I don't think this iteration of the Women's March will survive but...you make a decent point. Hopefully there will be something that everyone can come together on soon.

@JessicaThinkies @kelseyjharkness @womensmarch @March_for_Life It's hard to bridge connections with groups that exclude certain kinds of women and are associated with hate speech.
Heard @kelseyjharkness make a great point this week: The @womensmarch was founded on hate (of Trump) and so it has a short life. The @March_for_Life was founded on love, and that is why it has prevailed &amp; grown stronger every year for 46 years. Love grows. Hate dies.

@kurtimus @conservmillen Yes, for sure education is a big part of it

@kathrynlopez Some "normal" non-political people I know have texted me about it so at least I can see people are paying attention outside of those like us
@BillyHallowell I mean it's just unspeakable. I...have so few words.
dangit, I am tweeting about it.
Since most normal people find it abhorrent to murder children in the third trimester, perhaps this New York law will actually keep moving us more toward pro-life as a nation since this is so absurdly barbaric.
@TheCopyGhost definitely they would not.

@MattJKoe Well I think Obama was surface level good and certainly of high moral character but yeah, wouldn't call him a great President. But anyway, yeah, Trump's personality &amp; reputation are automatically provocative. There's lots of fake news on both sides, IMO! :)
@MattJKoe I just want to see what kind of reactions people get -- social experiment. But yes, I do think sometimes when people wear that stuff they are intentionally being provocative. However, wearing an Obama "Hope" shirt wouldn't really have been seen that way, right?
@JessicaThinkies I don't have one and I don't want to wear one. It would strictly be an experiment to see the kind of treatment you get. Your response of being "offended" is exactly what I am thinking would happen.
I'm curious what would happen if I wore to a #MAGA hat or t-shirt all day running errands. I'm actually too afraid to do it. 		Of course I live in Indiana so maybe it wouldn't be so bad?		Anyone want to volunteer for a case study? :)

@MattJKoe @VP It's just frustrating when it happens because I just know he is such a good person at heart and truly wants the best for people. He certainly has no hate for LGBT people at all and everything is just so misunderstood on religious liberty. I get why it is but still frustrating.
You know what makes your stress level go up? Trying to get your work done when your family comes home at 3:30pm and your baby is crying downstairs but you can't help because you need to finish working.

@LauraPhillips99 @MeghanMcCain @KellyannePolls @carrielukas @VictoriaRColey Of course we disagree on issues. The point is that the women's movement is condescending and disrespectful to women who do not abide by their progressive agenda. True feminism is supporting the equality of ALL women &amp; respecting their right to believe, live &amp; vote as they choose
@LauraPhillips99 @MeghanMcCain @KellyannePolls @carrielukas @VictoriaRColey We actually *are* scorned &amp; marginalized. Unfair that conservative women are treated as if perspectives aren't valid. Why doesn't the "women's movement" support women who don't think like them? That's the opposite of supporting women, it's supporting only certain kinds of women
@LauraPhillips99 @MeghanMcCain @KellyannePolls @carrielukas @VictoriaRColey We have different opinions about policy issues than you. That doesn't make our views invalid.

Half people in my poll said opioid crisis linked to jobs/economy. The top 3 states for overdoses in 2017 (Ohio, PA &amp; Florida) all had jobs/economic issues as well. Is not job loss and economic insecurity a plausible link, at least in some way? Hopelessness &amp; loss of purpose, etc.
@ljandersen But RIGHT NOW is not the point. The point is the past. We don't even have #s for opioid deaths from the past year yet. And I'm talking about the long term -- this is part of what made it worse, not caused it.

@shelbymedic Well next time I order, if you want me to get you some, you can pay me back. It's like $30. But you have to order $85 worth of product in order not to pay $10 in shipping so that's the only way you could get it without the shipping.
@shelbymedic You can buy one thing if you want though.
@shelbymedic Well, honestly, it's the kind of thing where it really takes using the full treatment to get any results. I would say the dry shampoo ain't gonna do anything for you. Just get that somewhere else. It's the shampoo/conditioner/treatments that get results.
@Shane106320 @dcexaminer Well, I did mention she is bisexual if you read it :)

@JustinKollar I'm seeing that point rom a lot of places, although it seems some percentage of drugs do come across the border illegally (not majority.) If a wall were to be built, it sure wouldn't be *helping* the drug cartels. I don't know if wall is best option -- just making that point.

@beeweezy_kc @jlgj6385 I'm not sure I can agree with you. I've heard and read otherwise. But..I'll try to read up on what you say.
@beeweezy_kc @jlgj6385 Oh sorry, maybe I'm confused on terminology. That sure makes me feel dumb. However, I mean people are generally dying from overdoses, not because they are being overprescribed, but because drugs are mixed with things like Fetanyl coming in from Mexico.
@JustinKollar Well yeah obviously not by refugee families, but by drug cartels. I see your point about the points of entry. I had not heard that but the documentary in the piece revealed a lot.
@jlgj6385 Death related to opioids are not almost entirely legally prescribed. Many people start their addictions from legal prescriptions, but I was under the impression that the majority of deaths are from synthetic opioids.

I keep hearing @ThirdLove exchanges are "really easy" on ads but...having to print a label, find a box and go to UPS to return is not easy. Given this is a bra company where returns/exchanges will be necessary, I think they should change their process.

Remember when you were going to do this @shelbymedic: https://t.co/DaCG9ii3PT
@shelbymedic I'm not saying you are wrong. I just have a hard time getting upset about it because most American men are glad they had it done. But perhaps changes are coming and I can certainly see how no circumcision all around would be a better option.
@shelbymedic I don't know, seems weird that hardly anyone seems concerned about it if it's that bad. FGM is FAR worse than circumcision, no doubt about it. I'm sure death, infection and problems are much higher.
Impressed she is sharing this. It's refreshing to see someone do something for someone who doesn't agree with them politically. Find the common ground. https://t.co/RZBdHPVlFk
@shelbymedic I can see where you're coming from but FGM is far more invasive, risky, mentally traumatizing (since it's done at puberty), and has tons of health consequences in terms of infection, bleeding, potential infertility, etc. Entirely different level.

@dcdaddysWT Well I'm not into the big buildings, but I do think having a place to meet weekly in some way (could be a home) is important for the community &amp; support aspect that comes with church. I say smaller churches are better churches in general...
@dcdaddysWT I personally hate when I see churches spending major cash on really nice buildings, etc. It seems beside the point and using so much money that could go to fund more important things. Our church meets in a building that's not ours so we have to set up/tear down every week.
