Then R. Kelly has been indicted today. I was not too surprised about it. Then Robert Kraft gets himself into trouble over prostitution. To be honest, it seemed a little unexpected. It seemed it just came out of the blue.
I wasn’t too surprised about Smollett because I had a feeling that he was probably lying. He is now in enormous trouble. For decades, there had been reports about R. Kelly’s behavior and then the documentary Surviving R. Kelly came out.
To be honest it seems weird. Jussie Smollett turned himself  to the Chicago Police early today. Then R. Kelly got indicted for crimes relating to children. Then Robert Kraft got into trouble in Jupiter, Florida over prostitution.

@lilbulli1031 @EinsteinMaga Another I would like to add is that States are not always doing their jobs in preserving election integrity. Again I do believe in the separation of powers specifically involving state issues and federal issues. Voting might need to be a federal issue then.

@Boyd_2650 To add to that, while they complain about what happens in North Carolina, in California, they don’t say anything about ballot harvesting. That’s total hypocrisy right there.
@Boyd_2650 Very disturbing indeed. No one should ever be involved in such corrupt practices like that. Isn’t that funny that there is a similar situation going on in North Carolina right now where the Democrats are complaining about something similar?
Just got back after my walk. It’s starting to look dark outside.
I have some exciting days coming up with Christmas parties and other things. Today is such a nice day, so I might go out for a walk before it gets dark.
@_LoveLike_JESUS I have been noticing something like that. I am down to 589 followers now. I thought that something strange is going on.
@marklutchman I am with you. It’s such a great movement. It’s been long overdue to happen. People who call themselves conservatives and at the same time, oppose Blexit, are not really conservatives that much at all.

I might do a poll regarding whether Gallup or Rasmussen or internet polling is better sometime this week so pay attention.
