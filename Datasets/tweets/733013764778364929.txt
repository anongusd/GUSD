@TheGoldman @WallStXyz @AOC So much for Globalization.
@TheGoldman @WallStXyz @AOC You also think that you are scoring points with the people on Twitter.
@TheGoldman @WallStXyz @AOC Keep it going for so long. You are convinced that you are always right and can see the future.
@Animalsandfools But he is a genius who planned that.
@TheGoldman @WallStXyz @AOC If he is gay he might grab my junk.
@TheGoldman @WallStXyz @AOC Was he drunk?
@TheGoldman @WallStXyz @AOC Tell yourself how to live. You care about yourself too much.
@TheGoldman @WallStXyz @AOC I should be concerned about others and not myself. Sounds like the opposite of survival. It is like you are telling me to die.
@TheGoldman @WallStXyz @AOC You are really convinced you are right about things.
@TheGoldman @WallStXyz @AOC If any of that happens I will be just fine.
@TheGoldman @WallStXyz @AOC Wow! Something is going to happen. You are really going out on a limb on that prediction.
@TheGoldman @WallStXyz @AOC How can there be Globalization if two next door neighbors can't even get along? 		Time doesn't really stalk anything. Nor is time a predator. Time is just a measure of the past present and future.		You sound like every other person that thought they could predict the future.
@TheGoldman @WallStXyz @AOC You go ahead and just wait for it.
@thetimes Muslim is not a race.
@JYSexton LOL! You seem to have very strong opinions. A strong opinion isn't necessarily a fact.
@MirrorMoney @DailyMirror The glitch is the company's fault and not the customer. The company should have to eat the cost.
@HuffPost That guy has lied so many times. People that still believe him must have mental problems.
@TomShumaker0707 @ABC You aren't part of the "people" if you don't agree with her.
@ABC I never voted for you. When you say you represent the people you lie because numerous people don't agree with you or your policies.
@TheGoldman @WallStXyz @AOC Like I said you have opinions that don't really match reality.
@ChuckCallesto It doesn't surprise me that he thinks he is bigger than the world.
@ChuckCallesto I did it all by myself in a capitalist system that has a military to protect me. His records and concert tickets were just bought by people in a free market. What does that have to do with capitalism? 😉😂
@lpolgreen Get Obama to bailout newspapers like he did banks. That way we can have more left wing journalists that write stories based on emotions and political ideology. We should live in a world where actions have no consequences. This way unqualified people can rule over qualified.
@risacohenrocks @Chambers_Z71 @agoldst23 @lpolgreen You told everyone that they were missing the point but still did not explain what the point is and it has been over 17hr since you made this tweet.
@lpolgreen Wow! Two different opinions of how the world should be. You must be the better one.
@TheGoldman @WallStXyz @AOC I would rather not live in a world where you made the policies.		How are you going to make me go along with you want?
@sgt_stingray @Bakari45 @kywd99 @NealB123 @AmyPeikoff @HoboSantaCruz @AOC You seem to cancel him out and he seems to cancel you out. What does the next person want? Oh it seems that he wants something even more different than the two of you. How is it that every person wants something different? What is this thing called individual freedom?
@NealB123 @AmyPeikoff @HoboSantaCruz @AOC Who wants to work when the government takes all of your money at the end of the week?
@AOC Why don't you start a business and pay other people what you think is necessary to survive? Why do you require everyone to act in the same manner? Isn't everyone being required to act in the same manner a limitation of freedom?
@TheGoldman @WallStXyz @AOC If Person A helps his potential competitor by giving him excess and Person B decides to start a business in the same industry after saving enough money, does Person B pay Person A 100?
@TheGoldman @WallStXyz @AOC Person B has no limit on what he can do. He can ask Person A to give him a $35 raise. 	Work for the $65 and live below the costs he must actually incur. Seek alternate work. Try to become friends with Person A. Work a second job. Try to start his own business.
@TheGoldman @WallStXyz @AOC The alternate truth is that every individual also can become a complete failure. No matter what you do there will be poor and there will be rich. There is no game in which everyone wins. There must me losers in life.
@TheGoldman @WallStXyz @AOC In America each person is given individual freedom to pursue what they want. Of course the harsh reality of the world makes it seem difficult to actually have this freedom. The truth is that every individual has the capability to achieve great success.
@TheGoldman @WallStXyz @AOC Individuals make their own decisions. How does one determine what someone else deserves? Many jobs are given on the basis of who you know and not what you know. There is no way to control all people. Regardless if you make a law or not some people will follow and others will not.
@TheGoldman @WallStXyz @AOC I have never met a person that was as wrong as you are until today.
@TheGoldman @WallStXyz @AOC I disagreed. You couldn't take it.
@TheGoldman @WallStXyz @AOC What about my narrative is false? Where did I play the victim? How does my reply not make sense? Where did I make things up? How did I not engage? Every one of your points about me is false.
@TheGoldman @WallStXyz @AOC You haven't sat peacefully at the table.
@TheGoldman @WallStXyz @AOC You haven't said anything in support of the original tweet you defended. Every point following it was a direct/indirect insult on me.		1. I can't read.		2. My narrative is imaginary.		3. SARCASTIC: You should write movies.		4. SARCASTIC: Spongebob with thumb up.
@TheGoldman @WallStXyz @AOC Nice rebuttal. A true genius responds with a Spongebob GIF. You really deserve more money for you talents and skill. I can tell.
@PeterPyke If the protesters get what they want their will be no peace as well.
@TheGoldman @WallStXyz @AOC Therefore I don't even want to work I just free food and rent. The policies you implement are unfair, unjust, and unethical. It is not right to make me work in such a climate.
@TheGoldman @WallStXyz @AOC The company could have hired them for $1 due to the excess supply of people that are qualified for the job.
@TheGoldman @WallStXyz @AOC All money paid in excess of what supply and demand dictates for a worker is considered free money. If a company can hire a worker for $1.00 an hour but the government implements a minimum wage of $15 the government is forcing the company to give $14 free to the worker.
@TheGoldman @WallStXyz @AOC Yeah. You think external forces outside the free market should control how much someone gets paid. External forces controlling the free market to give other people money based on your thoughts is giving free stuff.
@TheGoldman @WallStXyz @AOC Yeah you are smarter than everyone else and we should live life in accordance with your thought and beliefs.
@TheGoldman @WallStXyz @AOC Well that really isn't a smart thing to say. That is what I thought about the first thing you said as well. There seems to be a pattern.
@AOC If the forefathers say something in agreement with @AOC she thinks they are smart. If the forefathers say something in disagreement they are the opposite.
@WallStXyz @TheGoldman @AOC Hey now that we are best friends because we are required to think the same can I stay in your house rent free? I don't really make a lot of money and it would be greedy of you to charge me.
@TheGoldman @AOC I agree the guy that just won the $298 million lottery should have to give it all to the government since he didn't work hard for it like you supposedly do. He would be greedy to actually keep it.
@sixtechgod @TheGoldman @AOC Hey could I borrow $200?
@DailyMail That is exactly what I would do.
She can't really think that she is considered a survivor of war when she fled after the start of the Somali Civil War in 1991. To me a survivor of war is someone that actually fights in it and comes out the other side. https://t.co/0iHnEBK58A
@IlhanMN No actually you fled a country that was actually fighting and are trying to change the laws of a country that already has them.
@RealJamesWoods That money in his bank account could be used to help a fellow socialist.

@DailyMirror The legal defenses people have today are utterly ridiculous.
@thehill She writes a story critical about the teenagers and she is expressing a journalistic opinion. People on twitter write a critical opinion of her and it is harrasment. Through all of it she is the only one who respects opinions.

@nypost I don't understand why she isn't arrested as an accomplice to crime. Any person that snitches on these dealers is killed and she is still alive.
@lilprettydiddy @MeritLaw @5000RoleModels @Interstate_Tax Huh? Where did I say that?
@nypost These teens need to pay $1 to $5 million to the detective.
@lilprettydiddy @MeritLaw @5000RoleModels @Interstate_Tax If a suspect is resisting arrest he can do what is necessary to subdue the suspect.
@lilprettydiddy @MeritLaw @5000RoleModels @Interstate_Tax Never said they could. I said they could use the force necessary to subdue the suspect. If a suspect is sitting quietly in handcuffs cooperating and an officer punches the suspect out of anger that would be considered extra-judicial and unnecessary force.
@lilprettydiddy @MeritLaw @5000RoleModels @Interstate_Tax The officer is the suspect to the alleged crime of excessive use of force (assault battery etc) to the victim. One crime does not excuse another and that is what happened in this case.
@lilprettydiddy @MeritLaw @5000RoleModels @Interstate_Tax An officer using excessive force does not excuse the criminal behavior of the suspect. Now both must be sent through the justice system. The suspect is both suspect of the alleged crime and victim of the alleged crime perpetrated by the officer who used excessive force.
@lilprettydiddy @MeritLaw @5000RoleModels @Interstate_Tax Nobody said they were. Who said the had that right? They can use the necessary force needed to subdue the suspect.
Making generalizations and stereotypes about white people. https://t.co/SL3mj5mYkT
@ben_2350 @surlybassey @LadyMarsha510 @MeritLaw @5000RoleModels @getmefired There is no defense attorney anywhere that would come out publicly and condone criminal behavior. Mostly likely they would be debarred.
@ben_2350 @surlybassey @LadyMarsha510 @MeritLaw @5000RoleModels @getmefired Hmm. Another one. If they "defend the actions of criminals". A defense attorney does not do that. They defend the alleged criminal.
@surlybassey @LadyMarsha510 @MeritLaw @5000RoleModels @getmefired Tenthly, next time you drop the mic you better make sure your argument is better.
@surlybassey @LadyMarsha510 @MeritLaw @5000RoleModels @getmefired Ninthly, if you defend the actions of criminals one can only assume that you are in the same group.
@surlybassey @LadyMarsha510 @MeritLaw @5000RoleModels @getmefired Eighthly, there is enough proof that if a person acts a certain way a law abiding citizen has a legitimate concern for their safety and well-being. It is known that people that act this way engage in threats, illegal behavior, and harassment.
@surlybassey @LadyMarsha510 @MeritLaw @5000RoleModels @getmefired 29. Waka Flacka Flame	30. Foxy Brown	31. Ja Rule	32. YoungBoy never Broke Again	33. John Forte	34. Khia	35. Kid Cudi	36. Lauryn Hill	37. Lil Boosie	38. Lloyd Banks	39. Max B	40. Maino	41. Mysonne	42. Mystikal	( The list continues.)

@surlybassey @LadyMarsha510 @MeritLaw @5000RoleModels @getmefired Seventhly, there are numerous rappers with criminal records or accusations against involving guns, drugs, assault, rape, burglary, etc. The list		1. Biggie Smalls	2. Tupac	3. Lil Wayne	4. Gucci Mane	5. Cassidy	6. Chief Keef	7. Lil Kim	8. Meek Mill	9. T.I.
@surlybassey @LadyMarsha510 @MeritLaw @5000RoleModels @getmefired Sixthly, A man that is a criminal does not follow the law. Fear of him injuring me is a legitimate concern. Fear of black men is a racist generalization you made about my character. I fear a law abiding black man as much as a law abiding white man.
@surlybassey @LadyMarsha510 @MeritLaw @5000RoleModels @getmefired Fifthly, I took a guess that he listened to Phil Collins and Taylor Swift. I never said he listened to rap music. You assumed that he did meaning that you draw some sort of connection between guns, back men, and rap.
@surlybassey @LadyMarsha510 @MeritLaw @5000RoleModels @getmefired Fourthly, a black man does not scare me even a little bit. You once again assumed you knew something about my character.
@surlybassey @LadyMarsha510 @MeritLaw @5000RoleModels @getmefired Thirdly, speaking to an audience that agrees with you does not make you correct as there are multiple perspectives.
@surlybassey @LadyMarsha510 @MeritLaw @5000RoleModels @getmefired Secondly, you don't determine what logic is.
@surlybassey @LadyMarsha510 @MeritLaw @5000RoleModels @getmefired Firstly this is an imaginary argument you created and tried to say I did.		"hip hop mentions guns so it's ok for a grown man to threaten a child with one?"

@LadyMarsha510 @MeritLaw @5000RoleModels And some more .... https://t.co/BWN6PPFGfH
@LadyMarsha510 @MeritLaw @5000RoleModels Here is some more explaining https://t.co/WtzklSuhhL
@LadyMarsha510 @MeritLaw @5000RoleModels @getmefired Yeah I understand the quote quite well.
@LadyMarsha510 @MeritLaw @5000RoleModels What is there to explain?
@LadyMarsha510 @MeritLaw @5000RoleModels @Interstate_Tax He still admitted to breaking laws.
@TolstoyQuote No you will just encourage evil because you repay it with good.
It started with 100 righteous men. Time passed and then there were 90. Laws changed and then there were 50. More time passed and then there were 80 righteous men. Nobody knows what happened to the other 20.
Would a man unconvinced of his own beliefs act upon them?
@AOC When my craft is sculpting people judge me by sculptures. When my craft is speaking they judge me by my words.
@AOC The use of the word zillion gave them the impression that you were exaggerating your point to make it look more valid.
@GnarlyBluth How do you get a golfer angry?
@MarkDice I am not really sure what that would accomplish.
@GnarlyBluth It is a going theme for people on the Left to have problems with words instead of focusing on the main idea. Family, man, woman, wall, you name the word and the left has reason why we should be censored.
@GnarlyBluth No your picture shows you threatened by a cow.
@LouDobbs @RealCandaceO She had some very good points.
A man starts his venture with a good heart and very seldom ends his venture in the same way.
@NYCritix @larryelder @AOC @BarackObama The people you are claiming to be victimizers in no way knew that they were because the moral standard you are holding them too is the one of today. Men of the past cannot know the things of men of the future.
@NYCritix @larryelder @AOC @BarackObama Slavery was legal. Indentured Servitude was legal. There were other things that were legal. This means the frame of mind of the people that existed at the time of your alleged "stealing" was that of a law abiding citizen.
@NYCritix @larryelder @AOC @BarackObama Everything that I say to you is nonsense. You will not even entertain it. It goes back to what I said before. You think that you are a moral authority because you hold a moral opinion. I judge this to be nonsensical therefore it is.
@NYCritix @larryelder @AOC @BarackObama Ex post facto is not fake. In my tweet I merely stated what existed. A rape or murder is reprehensible but that does not give the prosecutor the right to torture the suspect in front of the jury to get a confession.
@NYCritix @larryelder @AOC @BarackObama No that is not what I said. I was kind enough to not assume what you meant by "That argument failed in Nuremberg." You however do not show the same respect. You my friend are not the essence of morality or the ultimatum of law.
@MarkDice @jack How is that any different than what would exist without Twitter?
@NYCritix @larryelder @AOC @BarackObama I am not against doing research on Nuremberg and the Holocaust however I don't feel that it is a legitimate point in this argument.
@NYCritix @larryelder @AOC @BarackObama Your tweet is incomplete. Nuremberg and the Holocaust are separate from the US and Slavery. What is the cost of freedom? In the US the North fought against the South. This means that a part of the US helped to secure the freedom of the slaves.
@NYCritix @larryelder @AOC @BarackObama Nonsense is claiming that Nuremberg is in the US jurisdiction. Nonsense is claiming the International Law is the same as US Law.
@NYCritix @larryelder @AOC @BarackObama It is like saying that Case 1 involves Person A and Person B and Per. B lost because Per. A won. Since this was the result in Case 1 in Case 2 between Person C and Person D, Per. D will lose because Per. C comes before him and that is what happened in Case 1. A is before B.
@NYCritix @larryelder @AOC @BarackObama Explain to me what you mean by "The argument failed in Nuremberg."
Buying dinner is usually a more welcomed gesture than talking at it.
@NYCritix @larryelder @AOC @BarackObama Fine, anybody that says the word Nuremberg owes me $100. You owe me $100.

The political viewpoints that are heard are the political viewpoints that are spoken the loudest.

@bauldlad @MardyMarvel @jakewertz @jdmaccoby Evidently all it takes is to read one's Twitter profile.
@MeritLaw @5000RoleModels Let's see you also seem to be a big fan of Meek Mill. Who said this "Shoot .... killl .... die go to jail for a shout out on ig lol I only hang with family." One can only assume that if you are so disgusted by guns, that you are also disgusted when the gun use is by a black man. https://t.co/ks4zUAVRZ6
@bauldlad @MardyMarvel @jakewertz @jdmaccoby Hmm that is interesting coming from you.
@MeritLaw @5000RoleModels You follow @Interstate_Tax  and he has said this "All we do is Break The Law 🖕🏾 🖕🏾 🖕🏾👮‍♂️". Why do you endorse someone that openly admits to breaking the law? How are you going to act like you care about the law all of sudden when a white man is the suspect but not a black man? https://t.co/nUGHizq5VV
@DailyCaller Good thing the left is concerned with a 15 year old boy who had a smirk on his face.

@SenSanders He was elected by the planet to represent the needs of Vermont or something like that.
@NYCritix @larryelder @AOC @BarackObama There is something called "ex post facto" written into the law. This means you cannot make a law today and hold people in the past accountable under the new law. During the time people owned slaves it was legal. They were only doing what they were legally allowed to do.
@rosaclemente @AOC Who are you to say someone else has enough?
@MSNBC Nancy Pelosi's front yard?

@RLeake1013 @bailabomba @jdmaccoby @HonestToddler You assume it is because of his color.
@bailabomba @jdmaccoby @HonestToddler These people were not killed specifically because they were black teens. The circumstances surrounding the situations led to them being killed.
@MardyMarvel @jakewertz @jdmaccoby He is going to hell because you don't like his answer. Sounds like someone thinks he is god.
@jakewertz @jdmaccoby You can't cherry pick facts. If what he said happened you can't ignore it. If what he says is a lie then of course it should be condemned.
@jdmaccoby Could you be more specific in the case you are talking about for the black teen? 		This over simplification of the world I find to be quite racist.		White Racist Leftist: Jake Maccoby	Fellow racist leftists, he is great.

@dbongino Actually it would be hookworm.		https://t.co/OitcaZRduX
@tomselliott @AOC She is a richist.
@HuffPost Gay Conversion Therapy
@stardust__films @guardian I know exactly what you mean. People like @iamcardib who assault other people and threaten them should not be promoted.
@guardian Is there any crime this guy doesn't like to commit?
@OliviaToke @nypost Women say no to me all the time. Why is this any different?
@OliviaToke @nypost LOL! Why is that? Have you built society or won any wars lately?
@BBCNews LOL! Now your race has something to do with of you go to a certain college. Admission scores a thing of the past just be mixed-race.
@DailyMirror Yep but NPR says women aren't violent. She will probably get 10 days in jail.
@nypost A pretty simple answer would have been "Sorry Jeff but you are married."
@DailyMirror LOL! The government itself can't stay afloat with it's own policies but it expects the individual to be able.
@GalliganChristy @cnni Yep you will be left with a debt of $100,000 and she will divorce you because you are abusing her by not having any money.
It is really scary to see how many liberals are ignorant to the law and how it works but still vote.
@KrisSanchez @UberFacts LOL! You think you can imply someone else's motive. Ok prove his intent. Your logic is basically I found a guy in the past that did blackface and this kids costume looks like it so it is blackface. It does not work that way.
@DavidFutrelle LOL! Some people like to just dig their own hole deeper.
Liberals think they can rename an apple an orange. After renaming the apple they think it takes the characteristics of an orange.
@Sean_PaddyM @DanRiffle @AOC Soon this guy will push for laws that you can only have $100,000 in savings at any one time. If you have more you are immoral.
@DanRiffle @AOC LOL! Each one of those people earned their money legally through the system. I would consider what you are saying and doing to be immoral.
@LevineJonathan Yeah that would be considered a crime of passion. People still get convicted and punished for that.
@RealSaavedra @jaketapper CNN has been doing the liberal dance for years.
@ABC Just think about all of the other women that will never get a gig with Avon because they don't fit the standards and Jameela Jamil does. Somehow she is still the victim. The Winner Victim.
Senator from the smallest state in the US has a problem with the Supreme Court. https://t.co/5IJr3BLf5W
@SenSanders And start the slide to socialism?
When the toilet is not clogged anyone can be a plumber.
Someone once told someone I knew that they were an arachnophobe. In order to prove them wrong they picked up a poisonous spider and died.
@intelligencer @AOC The reason the Founding Fathers only allowed property owners to vote at the start of the US is that they knew that the people that did not own property would always vote to take away the property of those that had it.
I told a person one time that they were wrong. I say one time because they never talked to me again.
When one problem is settled it is on to the next. What happens when all problems are settled?
My question for Christians is: What would you say to a person in heaven that told you they had an abortion?
@LilaGraceRose @GKCdaily Again where does you freedom end and the others begin?
A citizen really begins to question their freedom when they see another citizen arrested for exercising it.
Trying to convince someone who engages in an activity that the activity is wrong is a nearly impossible task. Even more impossible is convincing the next person and the next.
Was there ever a socialist or communist story that had a happy ending?
@DailyCaller Her view on Mike Pence is like a fart that you can see. You are disgusted by it for a moment but when the smell goes away you forget about it.
@DailyCaller People like her for her music not for her politics. She is not an elected leader she is a singer/performer that exists because people pay money for her tickets/shows/merchandise/music. She was not put into the public forum because of politics.
@TMZ @TooFab After gaining the respect of the people with such a comment she should give us her political opinion on Trump.
@NYDailyNews What is the purpose of work if when we work they take what we make and give it to someone else?
In order for everyone to enjoy freedom and liberty everyone must realize where one person's begins and the other's ends.
If we take all the money from the rich ( people who started business and invented products ) and give that money to the poor what will be the purpose of the money? With no inventors there is nothing to buy.
@WayneDupreeShow Leftists have already said that they don't mind leaving behind the people that don't agree with their policies.
@WayneDupreeShow It is a honorable thing to want to make the country a better place. However you cannot force people to do things that they don't want to do. Assuming that you know what is best for everyone never ends up being fruitful.
The left seems to like to use emotion as a platform to get legislation passed. Emotion is not going to save us from the situations we will face in the future. We need to elect logical and rational people to office that will do what is in the best interest of the Republic.
@Resistance2020 @DailyCaller What picture are you expecting me to see after I look at these individual cases?
@R_Ferrie @DailyCaller He has sort of used the event to launch a crusade. In a way I think he is acting under a sort of PTSD. He is emotionally a wreck because of the event and the friends he lost so he thinks that by pushing for stricter gun rules and regulations it will make that PTSD better.
@Resistance2020 @DailyCaller Lumping all gun statistics together without looking at the people involved and reasons or motives behind each is not really an acceptable method of argument. Criminals don't follow laws.
@DailyCaller I would consider him someone that feels that his opinions are more valuable than the rest of the American people because he went through a tragic event. The 2nd Amendment guarantees every citizen the right to bear arms. He is actively speaking against the US Constitution.
@people People should be seat belted into movies and forced to watch.
@MarkDice @TwitterSafety @jack I wondered the same thing.
@MarkDice @Bakari_Sellers @CNNPR The left really are a bunch of class acts.
@Lawrence @realDonaldTrump Confident
@JensterGeek @victorsojo @washingtonpost That is what it looks like to me.
Woman thinks people need her help. https://t.co/gGXZWZo2Es
Woman thinks that a boy standing quietly in a spot while someone else bangs a drum in his face is using white privilege. https://t.co/Lr6VIpSG9t
This woman thinks that wearing a Hijab in congress is a major accomplishment. https://t.co/Cy9wfQ7jf7
Guy thinks that someone who kneels during the National Anthem is great but thinks a white guy who compares himself to MLK is disgusting. https://t.co/9itYzMNxcE
The same people that say you have to treat and talk to others with dignity and respect, talk like this. https://t.co/N7Mom4wMj6
@SkyNews LOL! She is both hot and cold at the same time. She also walks north and south at the same time.
@DailyMirror A true three course meal.
@DailyMirror LOL!
@ronissocool @HuffPost You think people should have to look a certain way?
@HuffPost A whole news organization is attacking a child.
@KellyJoBluen Why do we have to sponsor your health care, food, housing, and subsidize the cost of raising your children if you can do everything on your own?
@CNNPolitics He is the "presidency-never-to-be". What is the story with everybody throwing stones in glass houses?
@Independent Didn't she just shock her private parts with a probe in public?
@DailyMail This would be illegal. The people need to be arrested and charged. If the police don't, they are failing in their duties.
@lizzwinstead @IngrahamAngle @IlhanMN Yeah that is what the First Amendment says.
@shaunking You want people to retract their false and misleading statements about you?
@BillyCrystal How to step in dog poop with Billy Crystal.
@kasie @PeterAlexander No thank you. How many sick days does she get?
@Independent But fear tactics are wrong according to the left.
@K_JeanPierre For being white?
@robbysoave The black guys say that they are allowed to say it because it is their religion and they have freedom of speech. The left's journalists say that the boys should be expelled and disrespected the Native American even though that boy didn't have to move.
@nypost Those are great artisits?
@JensterGeek @victorsojo @washingtonpost Looks like those black guys were harassing the Native Americans. They were talking about the totem poles and the Natives beliefs and why the land was taken.
@todd4cal @washingtonpost You mean like the church that Elizabeth Warren was just giving a speech at?
I'll take tell me what I want to hear for $1000.
The truth is much too hard to handle. That is why the left uses drugs.
The reason why the left would not be upset if the police beat up someone they perceive to be racist but be upset if they beat up a thief high on PCP is that they relate to the thief high on PCP.
@BreitbartNews The irony of the left saying that a police officer shooting a suspect in the line of duty is extra judicial and then calling for mob justice (extra judicial) on kids because they are Christian, white, and from the right is much too hard to ignore.
@mitchellvii Honestly I can't think of one. Sarcastically, more Democrats would get elected and they would enrich their friends at the expense of everyone else.
@MarkDice Sorry Mark but those people don't ever want to get educated. It is something you will always have to worry about.
@MarkDice Yeah they do that in Africa as well.	https://t.co/PUiKhQApJd
@MarkDice This is not only happening to these kids.
@CNBC @CNBCMakeIt If there is one man on Earth that deserves everything he owns, this is him.
@HuffPost Why is she always wearing red and not blue?
@PopulistPapers @BET The other thing is they steal, deal drugs, prostitute, talk however they want, murder, and rape but have a problem with someone who expresses their freedom of speech.
@Sincere09970852 @PopulistPapers @BET Get lost.
@SenWarren In a church and talking politics. It is like pissing in a kitchen.
@PopulistPapers @BET In addition they want everyone to respect them while they have their pants below their behind.
@PopulistPapers @BET I know. They understand very little about the laws of the country so they make their own.
@AOC You quoted a stripper who assaulted someone and just threatened someone else.
@BET That is interesting that you think that is a normal and acceptable way to talk to someone. If you can talk to people like that I can talk to you like that.
@nypost Wait who is in charge again?
@iamcardib Just watching all of the left on here encouraging violence.
@Refinery29 @AOC We already have a definition of justice in the US.
@matthewschmitz No apologies prosecute and sue them.
@NEdstrom @SkyNews That could be a violation of law and they might be sued.
@AOC In addition Cardi B threatened another citizen of the US and also recently assaulted someone else. How can a member of Congress support something like this?
@DailyMailCeleb That would be considered a threat. She should be in prison for her last assault.
@AOC Now this woman, who is a member of congress, thinks a stripper who dropped out of community college to rap and dance sexually is admirable and qualified to assess the actual situation that exists in America.
@AOC You just quoted someone who is an admitted member of the Bloods street gang.		https://t.co/fHYOajpkJl
@charliekirk11 Another drain on the system.
@Independent If he is a juvenile you are not allowed to show his face.
@Independent The people are no longer fit to judge one another.
@NEdstrom @SkyNews Juvenile.
@nypost She should have read all the stories on Trump.
@Reuters Where is Trump when all this is going on?
@thesundaytimes This is how leaders should be elected not like Trump.
@TheSun Do you think Trump is involved through Russia in this situation?
@guardian Finally an article about Trump.
@guardian You should just ask Trump next time and write the article about Trump.
@CBSNews Do you think Trump will watch this during the shutdown?
@DailyMailUK Do you think Trump advised her to do that?
@BBCPolitics This is a question for Trump.
@TheEconomist Trump needs to weigh in on this.
@Reuters Did he get approval from Trump?
@Independent Does Trump have the Flat Earthers' vote?
@Daily_Express I wonder what Trump thinks about this.
@LoveMyPhilly They should have got Trump to help them advertise.
@nytimes They should have linked Trump to this.
@BuzzFeed Is there any way you could do more stories about Trump?
@USATODAY How come this story isn't about Trump?
@Independent They should write more stories about Trump.
@Reuters I wonder what Trump is doing right now.
@guardian Is it strange to think Trump was involved?
@nypost The real question is ... did Trump ever wear those shorts?
@CBSNews Why do I get a strange feeling CNN can link Trump to this?
@MiguelDelaney Trump wasn't included in this person's article. Terrible journalism.
@CNNPolitics This tweet would be better journalism if it covered Trump.
@Independent It would have been a better story if you covered Trump.
@Independent You want some advice, just cover Trump.
@DailyMailUK These journalistic resources could be better used covering Trump.
@AwardsDarwin The pavement hit her. She is a victim.
@Independent Wrong.
@Independent BS! Only Trump does that.
@AwardsDarwin Are carrots, cucumbers, and bananas still ok?
@NtiAning Too bad the Native American instigated the whole thing.
@TheSun Women don't commit violence this can't be right.
@Ginas1369 @Independent They do. If they like you and really want a date they engage in the same activities.
@Ginas1369 Now you are stalking everything I said because I made a comment on the same thread you did disagreeing with you.
@Ginas1369 @Independent Can't get laid? What does that have to do with anything?
@DailyMailCeleb Just be like your sisters and find a basketball player.
@IndySport @Independent He was body shamed with punches.
@Tufftruth @ABC I am now also a victim of harassment.
@ABC Of course she found something to cry about. If crying is the new thing, some woman told me she wouldn't date me because my cheeks were too fat. That qualifies as body shaming. I am also a victim. A man who was body shamed.
@ChuckCallesto Why aren't the people on the left tracking down who these people are and posting their private information on twitter so other lefties can harass them?
@selkie77 @CanoeDude5707 @MarkDice @nytimes The school doesn't talk for that kid and I hope he sues.
@MarkDice @nytimes This is really something else watching these liberals try and destroy that kids life. I have lost all respect for them.
@nytimes Your newspaper will most likely get sued for libel.
@SenWarren Hope you get sued by that kid and the others. This is not what happened.
@AP This isn't the whole video nor is it the correct story.
@chinkieyez420 @BET Tough on twitter but somebody says something to you in the workplace you cry to HR.
@chinkieyez420 @BET LOL! From my experience in life you are the one who does all the crying.
@CNBC Everything that happens to these people is a crime.
@RockyMountViews @Independent Women do these things as well.
@Independent Billionaire sends texts to a woman he saw getting her oil changed by getting her number from the clerk.
@Ginas1369 @Independent Women do this all time. Too bad he wasn't rich.
@latimes It is very good women have the right to do this.
@Independent This is not news.
@chinkieyez420 @BET You is mad disrespectful to men.
@HuffPost He is getting worse at scoring touchdowns so he figured he would try being politically correct.
@MevanF22 @HuffPost I ask Marshan Lynch for advice on everything.
@Independent I  see numerous people on twitter stalk someone because there is a video of that someone doing something they don't like. Women post the address of their school, house, etc. If being creeped out by this is the normal reaction there are a lot of creepy women and men on twitter.
@maiapnina @AOC I am confused what dancing has to do with being qualified???
@bennyjohnson At least we know by the picture that walking while texting is acceptable behavior. If our leaders do it, so can we. We are all equal under the law.
@CoryBooker @senatemajldr Playing games like saying the stuff you say but not actually doing it?
@AOC (2)According to the law you are harassing Mitch using electronic communication as well as (B) potentially causing him emotional distress.		I suggest you get expelled and/or censured.
@AOC (B) causes, attempts to cause, or would be reasonably expected to cause substantial emotional distress to a person described in clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of paragraph (1)(A),
@AOC interstate commerce, or any other facility of interstate or foreign commerce to engage in a course of conduct that--		(A) places that person in reasonable fear of the death of or serious bodily injury to a person described in clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of paragraph (1)(A); or
@AOC (2) with the intent to kill, injure, harass, intimidate, or place under surveillance with intent to kill, injure, harass, or intimidate another person, uses the mail, any interactive computer service or electronic communication service or electronic communication system of
@AOC Stalking is considered a crime.
@nypost Wrong! Prepare for lawsuits.
@nypost The Media is full of .... (thinks about getting fired) ...... wonderful stories.
@kylegriffin1 Oh look a larger group of people harassing and saying mean nasty things to a smaller group.
@kylegriffin1 What is it called that you all are doing now?
@SnorreForsete @AwardsDarwin Are you done with your politically correct harassment?
@SnorreForsete @AwardsDarwin You had the issue:		"Are every dog walker a capitalist?" - Forsete
@SnorreForsete @AwardsDarwin No you brought it up. You made it an issue. I just said it. You has a problem with it.
@NYDailyNews Yep but I have to listen on NPR that women are not violent.
@SnorreForsete @AwardsDarwin If he was a socialist then he was just trying to share some of his face with the pole.
@SnorreForsete @AwardsDarwin Since when are the spoils of capitalism running into a pole?
@ABC Equal Pay For Equal Work Tax		96% tax on all elites who gave speeches.	97% tax on Hollywood actors and actresses.	98% tax on rap musicians.	99% tax on all athletes.		All taxes will start retroactively beginning on the day they started getting paid more than the average American.
@SnorreForsete @AwardsDarwin I didn't even look into that hard. I thought this was a comedy channel but apparently it is not.
@SnorreForsete @AwardsDarwin The only one who makes assumptions is you.
@SnorreForsete @AwardsDarwin Who exactly do you think you are?
@SnorreForsete @AwardsDarwin Who cares if you wonder?
@SnorreForsete @AwardsDarwin Why do I have to answer to you?
@SnorreForsete @AwardsDarwin What is your point?
@SnorreForsete @AwardsDarwin Is every star a sun?
@AllThingsGuru @nypost Maybe.
@Hadtwohurt Science!!!!
@MirrorWeirdNews Who exactly is the pig in this situation?
@CNBC @CNBCMakeIt That was smart. Have to hand it to her.
@guardian LOL!
@SkyNews Who has ever made $21 million from washing pots?
@TheSun LOL!
@MayaOppenheim I guess the family doesn't include fathers and brothers.
@SkyNews $21 Million seems excessive. What the hell is wrong with the court system?
@pocahontas86 @CBSNews You take responsibility for yourself and are knowledgeable. I respect that.
@pocahontas86 @CBSNews Just take the excess to a pill disposal or ask the doctor why they are prescribing you so many. They should be worried about you getting addicted. If they don't I would suggest finding a new doctor.
A tattoo is forever except for the fact that they have the ability to remove it today.
@TheGayAgenda14 @ABC Bye god. Rational! Another judgement by god.
@TheGayAgenda14 @ABC The left hides their bigotry under the guise of victimhood.
@TheGayAgenda14 @ABC I am not a member of the right, nor did I vote for Trump but what I have seen transpire over the past 10 years has really led me to lose all respect for the left. The left probably has double the amount of bigots and religious/political zealots the right has.
@TheGayAgenda14 @ABC Democrats are really going to start having a hard time. I see an increase in them going to jail over the next few years. This is a country of equality under the law. a standard you set for one person becomes that of another.
@CBSNews Doesn't surprise me. Opioids are only met to be taken to relieve extreme pain you have as a result of an accident/etc. They are not meant to be taken long term. I know this because I spend my time learning and not engaging in entertaining my feelings and senses.
@holdmyale Now go pay for the scratch you put on the bus and pick up the bottle cap you dropped in the street.
@TheGayAgenda14 @ChadHutch09 @ABC A pronouncement from god himself. He has the power to see the future and know what will be ok and not ok. 		Angry! Another judgement from the socialist god.		He wishes me peace but wanted an argument to begin with.
@TheGayAgenda14 @ABC The left doesn't obey laws, continually protests when they don't get their way, and uses threats of intimidation and violence to push their agenda.
@TheGayAgenda14 @ChadHutch09 @ABC Oh so what I say is a judgement but what you say is an opinion. Is that right god?
@TheGayAgenda14 @ABC I will not explain to you all of the things I have read and learned while your socialist gods Obama and Hillary charge hundreds of thousands of dollars to speak their nonsense. My knowledge belongs to me.
@TheGayAgenda14 @ABC You should read the news more and be more informed. Socialist attitude is that other people that are knowledgeable owe them something. Nobody owes you anything.
@TheGayAgenda14 @ChadHutch09 @ABC Why is it that your opinion is so great, god?
@TheGayAgenda14 @ChadHutch09 @ABC Unhinged! Is that you making a judgement god?
@TheGayAgenda14 @ABC You have the problem with the use of the word nobody. Also family, man, woman, and many other words. You want people to be forced to accept you regardless of what activities you engage in your daily life.
@TheGayAgenda14 @ChadHutch09 @ABC I was talking about you.
@ChadHutch09 @TheGayAgenda14 @ABC People like him think they are gods. They can dictate to everyone else what is moral, immoral, right, and wrong.
@TheGayAgenda14 @ABC When you tell me what words to use you sound like a communist/socialist that doesn't believe in the First Amendment.
@ChadHutch09 @TheGayAgenda14 @ABC @AOC Would you stick your finger into an electrical outlet?
@TheGayAgenda14 @ChadHutch09 @ABC The words of god have been spoken.
@CNBC @CNBCMakeIt My prediction for AOC is she is going to continue to promise these things not deliver and use the people that believe in her the most to become rich for herself.
@ChadHutch09 @TheGayAgenda14 @ABC @AOC It is pretty obvious they are gay as their name states that. I am pointing out a fact. They are gay.
@AwardsDarwin He deserved that. He got what he deserved. He earned it. A true capitalist.
@DailyMirror Compared to some of the punishments for crimes that exist I would say 24 lashes is getting off pretty easy.
@SenTedCruz US just releases drug dealers back into El Salvador anyway.
@ChadHutch09 @TheGayAgenda14 @ABC @AOC That could be true as well. But they are also trying to make me look like a hypocrite while they are being gay.
@CNBC @CNBCMakeIt Warren Buffet has been SAYING that for years but he has been DOING quite the opposite.
@ChadHutch09 @TheGayAgenda14 @ABC Trying to make me look like a hypocrite meanwhile they are gay.
@TheGayAgenda14 @ABC Nobody wants to do work because they get handouts from the government.
@TheGayAgenda14 @ABC Private schools are better than public schools, in every communist/socialist haven the police don't respond and the streets are filled with potholes.
@ChadHutch09 @TheGayAgenda14 @ABC Not really. They all can be privatized.
@ABC I suggest a 99% tax on all athletes.
@ABC Say no to socialism.
@PastorDreHill You are really going to compare a gang member to a police officer?
@TheSun Who is the culprit?
@LeonardGreene @NYDailyNews What about being passed for a promotion or a job because the manager thinks the woman is hot? Is this considered harrassment of the man?
@JordanUhl It is hard to follow logic when you are high on drugs.
@CNBC How the socialist government propped up by people that don't work and increasingly collect more and more social welfare will elect people that call for your $1 million to be taxed or seized to pay for their social programs.
Women activists have said that women were objectified and treated like meat in the past yet were not drafted or called to fight in a single war.
@DailyMailUK I don't understand why these people are allowed to continually harass other people on the basis of their own opinion.
@DailyMailUK Hope you both get caught.
@ABC I don't understand why any politician would think it would be ok to spend $545 of taxpayer money for a ticket that has nothing to do with government. In addition charging $545 for tickets doesn't seem to fit into the socialist viewpoints of the Obama's preached ideology.
@MizzyII @CNNPolitics Doesn't seem like freedom to me.
@AllThingsGuru @nypost She is a threat to society. She is a criminal. How can you show compassion for someone that hit two people with an axe for no reason?
@Newsweek How many people participated in this poll exactly?
@reesor38 @Newsweek They probably don't even have incomes.
@YosefRapaport My cousin was robbed and beaten by a group of black men and the police never found them.
@stephandeville @YosefRapaport @shaunking Who are you talking about?
@RepEscobar Could you advise everyone that has entered the country illegally and those who overstayed their visa to self-deport?
@RepEscobar Yeah the crisis of leadership is in the Democratic party.
@MORSECDE1 @cnnbrk Is that right. You going to tell me what the laws and rules actually say. I don't know who you think you are.
@MORSECDE1 @cnnbrk This also is considered abuse because you are attempting to silence my voice by telling me to leave the platform.
@MORSECDE1 @cnnbrk Again this is you acting like you are the maker and authority of Twitter. You just told me to leave this platform and go somewhere else because you like to intimidate people but claim to be knowledgeable of the law.
@MORSECDE1 @cnnbrk Again I reported you for abuse. Twitter will most likely block your account.
@JohnTho75651597 @MORSECDE1 @cnnbrk Yeah you can be shot dead if you run from the police.
@MORSECDE1 @cnnbrk I reported you for abuse. You obviously don't understand the rules of Twitter.
@JohnTho75651597 @MORSECDE1 @cnnbrk You sound like a criminal.
@MORSECDE1 @cnnbrk Flight is not an automatic death sentence. The situation and circumstances surrounding this case led to the death of a subject. The neighborhood could have been extremely dangerous. Officer makes the call.
@MORSECDE1 @cnnbrk Flight is the illegal act. You are supporting criminals and criminal activity.
@MORSECDE1 @cnnbrk The suspect could have grabbed someone and took them hostage. The officer could have been hit by a car chasing the suspect.
@MORSECDE1 @cnnbrk The man was a suspect he ran which is flight. The officer could have been led into an ambush or fell and hurt himself. He also could have died of a heart attack from the stress caused by the suspect. You are not allowed to run from the police.
@MORSECDE1 @cnnbrk rightful use
@JohnTho75651597 @MORSECDE1 @cnnbrk Yeah. you ain't the officer who responded to the call. You don't make that decision.
@MORSECDE1 @cnnbrk I wouldn't consider that extra judicial.
@MORSECDE1 @cnnbrk It also depends on the guys criminal history. He also could be someone who carried out a murder, rape, assault and was never caught. The officer has no idea why the suspect is running. Flight is a felony and when someone runs the officer can only assume the worst.
@MarkRuffalo @justicedems @AOC Communism and Socialism are not great.
@MORSECDE1 @cnnbrk If he is convicted the court pretty much ignored the Supreme Court.
@cnnbrk Tennessee v. Garner ruling in 1985 	"deadly force...may not be used unless necessary to prevent the escape and the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious bodily harm to the officer or others."
@MarkDice Street Credibility with the Liberals.
@larryelder Treating immigrants fairly since plata o plomo.
@JoeNeguse Spot The Difference		Immigrants || Illegal Immigrants
@Bobsoftheworld @MuslimIQ Yeah. What is his definition of racist today?
@AnnCoulter People are still watching.
Narratives are a lot like Dorian Grey. The narrative presented is the youthful and vibrant person that everybody loves and wants to believe. The unpresented portion is the picture that captures the truth of the narrative. Ugliness and all.
@Bobsoftheworld @MuslimIQ At this point we don't know how many of the eight years she will actually serve. Most likely she did not have a good lawyer because she was on parole.
@bakerjohnj @Bobsoftheworld @MuslimIQ Judges go through college and have experience in law before becoming a judge. It has nothing to do with elitism. What exactly is your profession and what gives you expertise in judgement? Your moral compass or religion is not exactly expertise.
@Bobsoftheworld @MuslimIQ Show me the stories about a Muslim suicide bomber killing innocent people on his thread. Show me the stories about black people murdering other people.
@Bobsoftheworld @MuslimIQ He started this thread to convince people that white people go out of their way to make people of color's lives harder. The truth is I don't really try to stand in anybody's way. I only feel the need to fight when my life is threatened.
@Bobsoftheworld @MuslimIQ I am talking about @MuslimIQ.
@Bobsoftheworld @MuslimIQ I am not the one who attempted to mislead the general public. The instigator or oppressor in this case is @MuslimIQ. I am not saying I am an expert.
@Bobsoftheworld @MuslimIQ It does seem excessive but when you are on parole you are under a microscope. She could have been shown leniency on the sentence she was on parole for.
@Bobsoftheworld @MuslimIQ the murders committed by blacks, and so on and so forth.
@Bobsoftheworld @MuslimIQ This guy repeatedly tries to make christians and white people look like evil people that are incapable of doing anything correct. He will not point out the numerous suicide bombings committed by Muslims, the unfair punishments carried out in Muslim countries ...
@Bobsoftheworld @MuslimIQ You can form an opinion on it. This is a democratic republic not a democracy. I don't really think you are qualified to make that decision. You couldn't even tell me all of the factors involved in both cases.
@TheLastMerlin @MuslimIQ As you can see the minimum sentence would be 4 years. This particular person did not have an extensive known criminal history. So they goy 7 yers. I would much rather not see the courts run by people that have no idea what they are talking about.
@TheLastMerlin @MuslimIQ The maximum fine is $25,000 plus a surcharge of $3,125. Upon release from prison, there is a mandatory two year parole period.
@TheLastMerlin @MuslimIQ Illinois second degree murder laws charge the offense as a Class 1 felony. This carries a sentence of between four and twenty years in prison. Depending on the leniency of the judge and the circumstances of the crime, a four-year probation term instead of prison may be an option.
@TheLastMerlin @MuslimIQ Your statement doesn't even make sense. This isn't considered a minimum sentence. 		Excuse me but I find your statement to be be biased and racist. You just accused a white judge with no known ties to white supremacy of being a white supremacist.
@Bobsoftheworld @MuslimIQ Voter Fraud may be the one of most serious problem in the district in Texas that this case was heard.
@Bobsoftheworld @MuslimIQ Judges determine sentences. Two different judges determined the sentences for these two different cases. Chicago is much different than Texas. There are many people that commit murders in Chicago that are not in jail. Is this fair or unfair?
@Bobsoftheworld @MuslimIQ I am saying that you don't have the power or the authority to write rules or judge rules. You are not an expert on the rules. You are a single person with an unknown profession forming opinions on the fairness or unfairness of the rules.
@shaunking Judges and juries have a duty to be impartial. We are guaranteed an impartial jury by the Constitution. Judges have a code of conduct that requires them to be impartial. You are not a judge or jury therefore you have no legal obligation to be impartial.
@MuslimIQ Excuse me sir but the State, City, Judge, Prosecutor, Lawyer, and other factors all determine the sentence someone gets. Maximum penalties and fines are all listed for every possible crime you can commit in the US.
Wisdom turns a young mind old.
In order for happiness to have a name there must be sadness. If there was only happiness it would be the baseline or the only feeling that we have. In knowing this come to accept that one cannot only be happy. The expectation to be this way is contrary to what we know of life.
@CurtisHouck What in the name of the deity to the religion you believe in are the people at CNN talking about. Does CNN think it writes the rules now or something?
@SenSanders He wants border wall funding. Sorry you are so confused on that.
@Newsweek Just lost another Democratic voter to the racist justice system.
@AwardsDarwin And the next Representative for California's 13th District is...........
@FallonTonight @RachelBros Wow! She should get the Nobel Peace Prize.
@kort_rob @HuffPost We don't like the use of the word happy. It assumes that all people that are together are happy.
@SB_zom @HuffPost There shouldn't even be government jobs.
@suzannerogers87 @HuffPost This is great thing. Taking money other people had to pay in for work they actually did.
@kort_rob @HuffPost Thanks to Obama, Schumer, and De Blasio my boyfriend was born a female but identified as x when he came out of the womb. He told the doctors he identified as male they all said ok. The rest is history.
@kort_rob @HuffPost You just homophobed me.
@kort_rob @HuffPost Yep.
@HuffPost Being gay?
@jaynordlinger Someone should do a study on all the things you are wrong about. I can only imagine how much the study would cost and how long it would take.
@BryanBroome1 @JohnCleese Could be. You can also catch STDs through other ways.
@JohnCleese Sex in the Bible and the teachings on it originate in the Old Testament. Moses was given the Ten Commandments on Mt. Sinai. One of the commandments is “You shall not commit adultery."
@BicYea50 @larryelder @USATODAY @IlhanMN Some people try to write history in accordance to their own narrative.
@FrankVeritable @CNNPolitics You think the people that voted for Hillary and Obama are educated voters?
The individuals opinion of what the law should be does not make it the law.
We the people includes both you and I. If you say we the people say this is good and I say we the people say that is good, we the people don't say the same thing.
@FrankVeritable @CNNPolitics Massachusetts has a population of about 6 to 7 million. Of the 6 to 7 million people in the state 1.7 million voted for Warren and a total of 2.7 million voted. Not even half of the people in the state voted (assuming all people are of voting age). She won by 700,000 votes.
@FrankVeritable @CNNPolitics The Judicial is made up of the Federal Courts and the Supreme Court.
@FrankVeritable @CNNPolitics Three branches of government Executive, Legislative, and Judicial. The Legislative writes the laws. The Judicial interprets the laws and the executive executes the laws. Executive is made of the President and the Vice President. Legislative is made of the House of Reps and Senate
@FrankVeritable @CNNPolitics You think Puerto Rico is Massachusetts? Ha Ha!
@nypost These are highly trained shooters.
@TheSun Genius.
@MSNBC The first lady should receive a salary. See the left when Obama was president.
@Daily_Express Global Warming sunk Atlantis.
@Trevonbosley1 LOL! More murders are committed by blacks on other blacks.
@CNNPolitics Google maps must have given her the wrong directions to her district.
@TheEconomist Is this a group of crazy white men? Couldn't be Muslims.
@ABC It is just that he used excessive force.
@MannyMontana305 @MailOnline I will remember you said that for when your wife does it to you.
@CNNnewsroom @IlhanMN @PoppyHarlowCNN @jimsciutto LOL! A muslim?		Islam teaches that men are in charge of women and yet here she is practicing her faith on the floor of Congress by wearing a hijab. Is this some sort of joke or something? Go read what the Quran, Hadith, and Sira says about a woman's place.
@CNNnewsroom @IlhanMN @PoppyHarlowCNN @jimsciutto How strong the Constitution is? Isn't the left always calling for people's speech to be censored?
The body heals faster than the mind. Scars are left on both. The pain outside slowly subsides. Inside it remains to be said.
@RealJamesWoods James you are hardly a moral deity.
@RealJamesWoods My grandfather had Alzheimer's disease he passed away before I really got to know him. My aunt and uncle both died of cancer. Aunt had breast and uncle had lung. My grandmother developed dementia. Telling someone that they couldn't joke about these diseases never cured them.
@HuffPost Keep us safe? You have no idea what you are talking about.
@nypost It is a fire hazard. The tree is blocking the telephone wires.
@MAKERSwomen @SenGillibrand How is this not considered discriminatory? She basically wants to make laws making it easier for women to make money and harder for men. Subsidize the woman while leaving the men to fend for themself.
@AI_Solzhenitsyn There are many well educated people that are intolerant.
@AI_Solzhenitsyn Trying getting robbed, assaulted, and left for a dead by a member of a different group than you are a part. I would like to see how tolerant you are afterwards.
Money is not a measurement of accurateness of claim.
@DailyMirror If only I the rich person am allowed to do it and the rest of you can't and are my subjects than I have succeeded in reducing emissions and meat consumption.
@AOC You have a problem with understanding who started the ball rolling.
@space_man_z @marcorubio @DiazCanelB You should learn to keep you religion to yourself especially when talking to a politician that is supposed to separate his from his politics. There is no mandatory religion in the US.
@space_man_z @marcorubio @DiazCanelB Fake Christian .... there is no 100% real Christian but Christ.
@capturelite @marcorubio @DiazCanelB Apparently not to you.
@marcorubio @DiazCanelB Isn't that the truth.
@nowthisnews @AOC For every story you tell to support your agenda there is a story to promote an alternate agenda.
@DailyCaller Don Lemon wants him to apologize.
@Davie40887385 @SkyNews So does that mean we won't be going on a date together.
@GovMikeHuckabee @RealJamesWoods Better yet .... let the back-scratching begin.
@GovMikeHuckabee @RealJamesWoods Sounds like a waste of taxpayer money. I heard liberals are good at using up taxpayer money.
@JohnJHarwood You lose I understand that.
@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Doesn't sound like something the Forefathers would say. Washington to Jefferson "Hey I think we should go back to Europe and stop nation building." Jefferson to Washington "Ok, I don't want freedom anyway."
@Essence @MichelleObama How will she afford $4,000 boots under AOC's 70% tax plan?
@usatodayvideo Celebrating 55 years of Socialist beliefs wearing $4,000 boots.
Isn't it ironic how the left claims that video games have nothing to do with the rise in violence in schools and society by the youth but the military now uses video games to train soldiers how to kill.
@TolstoyQuote Try getting a drink when you can't afford water and say that again.
@Petal1161 @weepeacock @SkyNews @rickygervais Actually by nature dogs/wolves are predators that kill and eat prey and it is only through owners they are domesticated. You seem to have a problem understanding which comes first the chicken or the egg. They have adult education classes you can go to.
@Petal1161 @weepeacock @SkyNews @rickygervais This was a stray. A stray by definition doesn't have an owner. I know this is hard for you to comprehend but you will have to try.
@USATODAY Yeah I don't support Communism and Socialism and bailouts to people who failed at capitalism.
@JordanUhl @AOC Cardi B does not approve.
@JordanUhl @AOC Very good comparison.
@TheSun Showing off your looks doesn't really transition well to any other industry.
@weepeacock @SkyNews @rickygervais Animals attack people sometimes. Since you didn't understand I thought I would explain it to you.
@SkyNews Maybe he attacked someone.
@hartenatasha @MindfulArchi @Independent That is a good reason to be straight.
@TheEconomist Maaaaaa-caaaaaaaaw
@CBSNews Isn't funny how when they are jailed suddenly they know something.
@DailyCaller Sounds like a law only a woman would come up with but in reverse.
@TheSun You have to be crazy to marry her.
@Independent I don't think I will ever have this problem.
@RealJamesWoods @AnnCoulter Very good. Finally doing something about it.
@nypost Prison would be a good place for these two.
@thesailorjupitr @USATODAY Funny
@SullivanMonty @USATODAY Right! They are too young to have their entire life thrown away because they lack the knowledge, wisdom, and understanding to deal with whatever brought them to the point where they would make such a threat or plan such an act.
@USATODAY Ok obviously they need mental health counseling.
@policyjunkie @AOC Think I am going to take a safe walk through the Bronx &amp; Queens.
@loisromano I could only assume that someone with the First Amendment as the background for their Twitter profile is sarcastically asking this question. If you are not I don't see the value of a Harvard degree anymore.
@Newsweek Make the right calls. There should be penalties when refs don't call the games according to the rules.
@JessieJaneDuff @Gillette We all need to fit in a mold created by Gillette.
@AOC I don't see what is complicated about Twitter. Why would anyone need to teach a class on it?
@realDennisLynch @AOC This is funny because it is true.
@Newsweek Good for Karen Pence. Can you believe America gives people the right to pursue their own interests?
@RepPressley @WhiteHouse @senatemajldr Sound like crazy talk to me.
@TheSun She stands with her brothers in protest of Gillette.
@HuffPost I am pretty sure a hellhole is defined as a stripper has more money than you when you actually went to college and have a bachelor degree or even a master degree.
@Manny_Insanity @DailyCaller Secondly that would be your opinion. Maybe you should take a course in government to learn that it doesn't operate on your opinion.
@Manny_Insanity @DailyCaller I said what because you just said it.
@Manny_Insanity @DailyCaller What?
@DailyCaller We can't afford a wall that is crazy. - Democrats		Let's make universal healthcare paid for by a 70% tax rate on the rich and also forgive all student loans while getting rid of ICE. That will work very good idea. - Democrats
@Mohamme34464114 @JahanaHayesCT She just applauded your right to say that.
@nypost Doesn't seem normal. Seems like a radical approach to hide and seek.
@MSNBC @allinwithchris I can't remember the last time a 30 year old rookie successfully played mind tricks on a 76 year old veteran.
@CNBC @CNBCMakeIt When I try to sell something to men I want a mixed response. Goal Achieved.
@nypost Colin Kaepernick would have knelt all over this.
@nypost The cop should have just taken a vacation day and let BLM handle the situation.
@Newsweek Has anyone ever looked at all of the predictions she has made over the years to see how right or wrong she is?
@larryelder Nobody is being held hostage. Congress and Courts argue words and set legal precedents. It is irresponsible for lawmakers to use words with specific legal meanings in contexts other than the contexts they are meant to be used.		Hostage Situation:	https://t.co/zQA1LgiAsh
@DailyCaller She did it because men are pigs and are always talking about sex.
@KristySwansonXO I didn't even look. What are they advertising again?
@KristySwansonXO Leading the way!!!!
@RMadbrow @cnni @CNNOpinion Everything is a person too.
@Newsweek Ok show me the list of all the people that support this.
@DailyMailCeleb This is a joke. You have to go to work everyday and make next to nothing while some women gets paid millions to pose provocatively. Meanwhile the women in the workforce are suing people for sexual harassment and receiving lager settlements than you will ever make working.
@WillDavis_14 @DailyCaller Redneck is a slur.
@PattyMurray @senatemajldr Maybe you don't understand what a majority vote is. I think that is what the problem is. Democrats don't understand the definition majority.
@KevinDaleyDC @BenSasse @KofC Saying people that are born men can be women is not considered an extreme position?
@CBSNews @byKateSmith No irony here.
@DailyCaller Not a big surprise. People get their jobs today based on who they know and not what.
@DirtPerfect You also think it is normal to sleep with the same gender.
@DirtPerfect You think pink is a normal hair color and by your profile name I can only assume you take LSD.
@DirtPerfect Man you really are annoying. You can't seem to understand that I am allowed to have my own viewpoint on things. What are you going to do about it? Are you going to continually harass me for the things I say until I turn gay? Why are you stalking me and retweeting what say?
@ABC When the government reopens the Dems are going to claim it was a victory on their part.
@BillOReilly What are they afraid of? It must be dogophobia.
Maybe someone could explain why Nancy is allowed to retaliate.		https://t.co/gzfa92sDyn
@BillKristol Yeah the 'Pearly Gates'. Heaven ain't open to everyone.
@mrglenn Yeah they call it the 'Pearly Gates'.
@UnAspirate @javitagracia @Newsweek Homosexual re-education is ok but heterosexual re-education is wrong.
@DirtPerfect Yeah you are afraid of straight people.
@HeyyItzMimicTv @BET There was an instance of this...		https://t.co/z20geZay4a
@HeyyItzMimicTv @BET It just doesn't make sense. If a group of white people start to harass a black family they would call it a hate crime and say that the black guy punched in self defense.
@MarkDice She just got elected and she is the most qualified because the emotional left said so.
@RealJamesWoods Some guy is shaming you and calling you a coward because you blocked him.
@drpichel @Newsweek You sound like you can't read.
@TheSun Is she attempting to get men to look at her body?
@BET Glorifying drug use led to the opioid crisis. These people are not role models.
@cnni If she didn't qualify by the rules this is a violation of the law by the person who granted asylum. There are many other people that qualify and are turned down. Fleeing you family is not fleeing a government that would persecute you. Illegal.
@cnni Umm under what rule did she qualify for asylum?
@CNBC @SheTHINX @CNBCMakeIt Yep but if they sexualize themself it is acceptable. I am sorry but I didn't want to see women in their underwear that are not my girlfriend.
@drbeasthunter @TheSun None of them are women so it is ok.
@Spenwah @TheSun Yep. They spend years trying to convince you of something and then they change the tune.
@tidysome @TheSun I would be so happy.
@bradders90skid @TheSun It is considered sexual harrassment.
@TheSun I got the screenshot. https://t.co/dTmEPtuXJM
@TheSun Sexual harrasment. I would sue the sun if I was one of these actors. Sue now.
@BET It looked like there were harrassing him and his family. People aren't considered immune from breaking laws because they are black and/or juveniles.
@RootedGinger @guardian That is you in your space this is me in mine.
@cnni All because of the drug dealers the left let out of jail.
@nypost The real problem is the white guy who invented cameras.
@Reuters @michellenichols They are the UN they shouldn't have a problem 'fixing' the perceived problems of the world.
@DailyMailUK The problem is that he doesn't have money.
@TMZ Her own dad?
@Independent Police the man.
@BET Should be hard for her to get attention.
@HeckingFurBall @guardian They say you are s*** shaming.
@Sqyreall @guardian Has there ever been a time woman haven't tried to convince them that the men were wrong and women were right?
@RootedGinger @guardian Part of being a man means you respect others space. Telling another man what to do is not respecting his space. You are a disrespectful person.
@guardian I am at the gym lifting I guess I should just stop and go get a manicure.
@KatiePavlich Try to appeal to the criminal left.
@AOC This looks like she attempted to womansplain to someone.
@MaryEmilyOHara I feel bad that you are confused and need a man to explain something to you.
@thehill @HillTVLive That poll is BS. Much like the numbers used to predict the next president.
@RealSaavedra Democrats are holding justice hostage.
@RitaPanahi Really. What made them creepy?
@Newsweek Didn't even consider it domestic even though they were partners because she was a woman.
@UnAspirate @javitagracia @Newsweek The sad thing is that she is actually a reporter. I don't believe anything I read anymore.
@UnAspirate @javitagracia @Newsweek She sure did. They really think they are morally superior.
@javitagracia @Newsweek This was a lesbian. So it is more like female toxic masculinity. Tampon should dona commercial telling women to stop dressing and acting like prostitutes.
@drpichel @Newsweek They are lesbians and it was a woman. Sounds like a liberal Hillary voter to me.
@Newsweek Sounds like something an Eagles fan would do.
@mepeterson59 @NorahODonnell @bridgetmoynahan @TSA @krisvancleave Nobody is being held hostage.
@NorahODonnell @CBSNews @TSA @krisvancleave They are just using government money like it belongs to them and not the taxpayers.
@SkyNewsPolitics @SkyNews Soft and hard? Who came up with this terms?
@WTFQuest @DailyMailUK Oh well. Too bad for her.
@MirrorHealth @DailyMirror Getting a butt like Kim is a major accomplishment for some women.
@FraserNelson What does it matter?
@ddale8 @shaunking Donald Trump wears a suit and has hair this is pretty controversial to the media.
@TheSun She married a paedo?
@WTFQuest @DailyMailUK She is getting half of the money anyway.
@DailyMailUK Men are such pigs.
@MailOnline A case against universal heathcare.
@DirtPerfect @enews Nope that is BS. Sorry I am the one writing this story. All women are oppressed by white males how could she be having fun you hetrosexualphobe.
@DailyMail White privilege and male patriarchy are to blame for this.
@people She should teach her son to deal with the realities of life and send the divorce fairy in at night to take away half of his toys.
@washingtonpost CNN will save a lot of money on buses when they transition them all to the short kind. I am buying stock.
@enews A touching gesture.
@DailyCaller More proof that men are shallow.
@IslandKing63 @ShuttleCDRKelly I don't think you are going to get an answer. Even if you had the answer he wouldn't care.
@enews What do they call that face? The I Am A Powerful Woman Take Me Seriously Face?
@BSO @MiamiHerald Looks like you have a problem with free speech that doesn't occur during a National Anthem.
@CNBC @CNBCMakeIt Sleep with married men.
@CNBC @CNBCMakeIt Apparently you should have an affair with Jack Welch.
@john_king0814 @nypost You better watch out for the people who patrol twitter and take everything literally.
@TousFous @TheSun The moral superiority of the celebrity class.
@TheSun Sorry but nothing is going to stop you from getting old.
@shaunking @TheNorthStar First story from The North Star:	White Man Shoots a 7 Year Old Girl Even Though it Was Two Black Guys
@BuzzFeedNews I thought vanity projects were not a good thing to use money to build.
@mynameiszach16 @Ryan58377157 @shaunking @FoxNews @FDRLST Didn't really expect an intelligent response from you.
@MrNobre @THEtrlppyIoner Bro I can just imagine the backlash if you would take a picture of a woman wearing something revealing and go "What is the point of this?"
@KamalaHarris Crimes are clearly stated.
@Ryan58377157 @mynameiszach16 @shaunking @FoxNews @FDRLST He thinks he is in the "in group" because he is guilt ridden.
@NAACP_LDF @SenBooker Crimes and the sentences for those crimes are clearly stated to all.
@Ryan58377157 @mynameiszach16 @shaunking @FoxNews @FDRLST Yeah you have to love people that that think they are better than everyone else. He is white but somehow when he explains something it wouldn't be considered "whitesplanning" because he is a member of the in group.
@ABCPolitics I thought they did it for the good of the kids and service to country.
@LauraCornish511 @TheSunShowbiz @TheSun This is old world thinking.
@ChuckCallesto Don Lemon is still waiting fo an apology.
@DailyMirror Nuts
@DailyMirror Why?
@PeterPyke @DailyMailUK Don't you find that to be a little discriminatory and racist?
@MarkRuffalo Since when do people come to you to ask what is ok to joke about?
@TheSun She needs to learn how to meet a man's needs.
@TheSun Rude.
@TheSun That is disrespectful to the people that actually have to live hard lives. Let's see if she smiles if she cannot afford her next meal. Out of touch.
@RubinReport We are not defined by who we are but rather what is on our papers more specifically our birth certificate.
@AwardsDarwin Participation Trophy 💎
@LauraCornish511 @TheSunShowbiz @TheSun This is backwatlrds thinking females need to pay the whole bill. You forced males to do it in the past.
@Amy_Siskind Stop using a symbol of nature to promote unnatural things.
@AlecMacGillis They need to right more articles comparing the left to Stalinists.
@BET They put a camera in front of him and now he is important.
@BET A reality star. Are they the new thinkers of our time? What is this garbage?
@DailyMailUK What? I got to work for a living and this is the kind of stuff they think I relate.
@Independent It looks like it triggered the Independent because this is about the 15th times this morning they are talking about it.
@Independent Progressive and liberal values give him a participation trophy.
@Daily_Express I am dazzling in my $10 outfit from Goodwill.
@RashidaTlaib Fellow comrade.
@joshgad I am just going to go read a history book.
@AOC Comrade Cortez
@TheSun I agree women should pay for everything. There were countless years of male oppression where the males had to pay for dinner.
@nypost C-section brought to you by a diverse gender neutral soon to be bankrupt hospital near you.
@Newsweek @benshapiro Comrades.
@WSJ This is bad. Completely wrong.
@HuffPost Typical criminal behavior fits the profile.
@DailyMirror These a hole journalists.
@guardian Hate group
@ABC @ThisWeekABC Privatize it all.
@trind21_theresa @MirrorCeleb @MirrorTV Ban her from all committees.
@MirrorCeleb @DailyMirror She is a diva?
@TheSun Grant her asylum.
@CNNPolitics Privatize everything
@SonnyBunch I buy my razors from the dollar store.
@HuffPost I am a victim of everything.
@HuffPost Whaaaaaaaah!
@MirrorRoyal @DailyMirror Do you mean I have to step in front of a bullet for her?
@Independent Now companies are using politics in ads to convince us of an agenda.
@Independent Annoying
@TMZ Ban him from serving on any rap committees for making such remarks.
@Yamiche @NABJ You promote double standards.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump Sexist legislation I am going to sue.
@AOC Communists and socialist are worse than racists.
@AOC Remove the communists and socialists from congress.
@VonniMediaMogul @WayneDupreeShow Threatening the president is not a First Amendment right. Threatening to kill anyone is not a First Amendment right.
@MNNyoks @WayneDupreeShow For some reason the police forget how to do their job when a woman is the criminal. They love arresting men and ruining their lives.
@WayneDupreeShow I know I thought the same thing. I think it is because she is a woman. This is BS they have arrested men for doing that.
@AOC America isn't socialist you shouldn't be allowed to touch any legislation either. Ok Comrade Cortez.
@MirrorTV @DailyMirror That would be a big loss.
@nypost https://t.co/CyYaGM9LFw
@nypost https://t.co/fEp4CAWB3M
@nypost https://t.co/5lHEfhg1VW
@nypost It is just that they threatened police on multiple occasions. They did not peacefully protest.
Justification is not found in that someone else is doing it.
@enews Huh? You bought those things. You conditioned yourself.
When the standard you choose to measure yourself by is that of another be prepared to be the same as the other you compare yourself.
@mynameiszach16 @shaunking @FoxNews @FDRLST What is it called when you explain something?
It does not matter the quality of the vote rather that they voted for you. There is no measurement for quality when counting votes, only the vote itself.
@cnni All because of illegal drug dealers.
@mackymcgehee @PhilipRucker You is smart.
@PhilipRucker I think they should demote you to chief spell checker.
@PhilipRucker Your tweet points out clearly who has more on their plate right now.
@realDonaldTrump Apperantly selling a border wall isn't as easy as college degrees and rooms at casinos.
@washingtonpost Perspective: How people with an "agenda" try to convince you of it.
@Newsweek Win for the Americans thanks Superman.
@MirrorRoyal @DailyMirror This is amazing she is the first woman to get pregnant.
@Daily_Express You are supposed to eat the salad with the 12th fork to the right of the plate.
@MailOnline Violently stabs like the monster she is.
@SenDuckworth Is this the premise to the new fiction story you are writing because of the inevitability of your loss in the next election.
@DailyMailUK I have never been more unenthusiastic in all my life.
@DailyMailUK Yep. Only crazy white people at Charlottesville  rallies do this kind of stuff.
@Independent The NBA and NFL have also made cases for how bad it is for African/Haitian/Jamican/European/Black Americans.
@laughsee Even dogs and children.
@guardian Genie was blue not black.
@ashtonpittman @shaunking Increasing black and Hispanic. GOOD	Increasing white. BAD		But white people have a racist ideology.
@ashtonpittman @shaunking Huh?
@DailyMailUK Full circle
@TheSun People are so mean except when I am being the person who is mean to others.
@MirrorTV @DailyMirror LOL! If she won do you think they would still use the word violently?
@AprilDRyan For grades, sympathy, or skin color?
@CassandraRules What is to blame?
@Independent Now you have probably started death threats to his house good job you are great people as well.
@TheSun The screen is too big for female fingers.
@ABC During a government shutdown?
@SkyNews Solve bad treatment by treating yourself worse. Maybe she should light herself on fire as well.
@Newsweek Yeah boy down with the King. It is time for a revolution baby.
@Independent There is a lack of diversity in inner city babershops.
@MirrorWeirdNews @DailyMirror Women don't need advice on what to do with their bodies.
@emarvelous Very short thread.
@MailOnline Those are the rules of Egypt get familiar with them if you live there.
@jemelehill Some black guy tried to sell me crack when I was a kid.
@laughsee Pretty much everyone.
@Tessa_Weinberg @capitalweather How can people do something like this when there is a government shutdown?
@nataliesurely @AOC Typical example of butt kissing.
@Newsweek Ok gringo.
@DailyMirror Don't tell a woman what to do with her body.
@TheSun Public indecency she is a pervert.
@DailyMailCeleb Lame
@washingtonpost Perspective women's colleges are sexist.
@IlhanMN What? Vote her out.
@Independent What a joke.
@ScottPresler Liberals.
@shaunking @AOC Maybe we can start conducting congressional hearings on twitter.
@RealJamesWoods You should only be allowed to be blonde if you are born blonde.
@guardian Yeah straight roles should be reserved for straight actors.
RT @RealJamesWoods: After decades of a liberal jihad on white male “toxicity,” young victims like this have no recourse. The schools don’t…
@TheSun Some people have serious problems.
@TheSun What?
@DailyMailUK That isn't your country.
@Independent @RLong_Bailey Yep another tax.
@JeromeHaig @realDonaldTrump Yeah because the debt that existed already was his fault.
An argument between two people, both who are blinded by their own opinions, is known as a waste of time.
@StonedConservat @ben41080 @larryelder What is the point in even arguing?
@larryelder People have reported these facts numerous times and have mostly been called racist.
@Amy_Siskind Coup	a sudden, violent, and illegal seizure of power from a government.		Must have been so fast and violent that nobody saw it but you. You got some quick eyes woman.
@Amy_Siskind Attempted coup? How come I didn't read about this anywhere? We are a Republic.
@jonfavs It seems that you already are convinced of the answer. Why ask?
@craig_xp @shaunking @TheNorthStar @Wendys Now I finally see. What the hell was I thinking all of these years?
@craig_xp @shaunking @TheNorthStar @Wendys I would like to see them change the menu a little. Do you think we can get it done?
@nypost I was talking about the woman.
@nypost I am still trying to get the one removed from my wallet.
@AwardsDarwin Women have a higher pain threshold than men so if he changed his gender on his birth certificate it wouldn't be as bad.
@CNBC @jockowillink @CNBCMakeIt What if Monday is your friend?
It is hard for a thinking man to get married because his wife starts to tell him what to think.
@shaunking @TheNorthStar Sounds like a form of Colonialism. Changing the world.
@craig_xp @shaunking @TheNorthStar @Wendys Did you say $5? That is a deal.
@HuffPost When one survives in the wolves den by acting like the wolves he becomes lost when he acts as the sheep.
Knowledge is universal. But not universally held.
One cannot plagiarize what is true. Knowledge is comprised of truth. Once one obtains knowledge it is theirs. Knowledge is obtained through the separation of that which is fact from that which is fiction. That which is fiction can be plagiarized.
@SkyNews If a random person on Instagram tells me to buy a coffee I buy the coffee. These people know what they are talking about they get paid good money to say it.
@DailyMailUK She achieved so much more than the guy living in his mother's basement.
@John1_Welsh @DailyMailUK Same as the Democrats in our country. They advocate for the early release of felons and the right for those felons to vote.
@Alan_Shaw1 @DailyMailUK Get them all on camera saying mean things. Don't let them get jobs. Long live the tolerance of the left.
@shaunking @TheNorthStar Where is my place in this new world? What is your place?
@DailyMailUK In otherwise some men are pretty dumb.
@TheSun How come you don't fear for the safety of the men that have to mine the diamond?
@adelsonthompso1 @TMZ Maybe. Depends on the price tag.
@sussex_mc @TheSun Looks like spousal abuse to me.
@holdmyale This new technology is actually being advertised as a new method of constipation relief.
@adelsonthompso1 @TMZ Maybe. I don't like how he is handling the situation. He can do what he wants.
@holdmyale Usually when you get a bad feeling about something you don't follow through. That is what makes this person exceptional. He has a bad feeling about something and still follows through.
@TheSun "How to Turn Your Man into a Pansy: Even if He is A Prince" New New York Times Bestseller written by Meghan Markle. Vegan approved literature.
@sussex_mc @TheSun Is it ok to force somebody to eat grass?
@adelsonthompso1 @TMZ I heard the CB, LB, SS, and FS have his number now. Too much cockiness and arrogance for one day.
@adelsonthompso1 @TMZ Drama Queen / Problem Child / Jerry Rice never had those problems.
@Schovillova @BuzzFeed Capitalism at its finest.
@CNBC With your wife.
@AOC Fad/craze
@TMZ Jerry Rice never did stuff like this. I used to like this guy but now I am just a fan of Jerry Rice.
@Newsweek Maybe it is a sign from God.
@Axford @Independent Better to attack one person than a group. Seems like you promote fairness but don't actually believe in it.
@Jeswal_63 @Independent Sounds like a bunch of stereotypes and generalizations. Better to stay in your moms basement than be a colonialist. From what I hear everything white people achieved is actually racist, xenophobic, sexist, and patriarchal.
@BuzzFeed These things were never needed before.
@Independent Did they really get that guy on camera saying those things?
@TheSun LOL!! Reverse Colonialism at home and in the bedroom.
@BET No matter what you say you will receive both applause and boos.
@_waleedshahid @AOC How does the government operate on civil disobedience?
@NYDailyNews Where drugs or alcohol involved or was the person thinking at their finest?
@Independent Every wedding is more fun when there are a million laws to follow.
@nypost Stop being such jabronis.
@Independent Don't buy it.
Even a child knows that if the child cries enough the child will eventually get what the child wants.
@CBSNews So sick of these guys that trash the system then get a shot in the system and suddenly the system is perfect.
@maxberger @justicedems @AOC What are you even talking about?
@MirrorCeleb The players said you need to be a player in order to be an analyst now you can be a person who has sex on camera for money.
@Independent I don't even know what to say because somebody else will tell me what I have to because they are offended.
@TheSun That is what pythons do.
@daejaun19 @Lovey4617 @nypost Are you above me? I ask because you are speaking down to me.
The truth does not need the approval of others to be true. For this reason the truth is a lonely thing.
@washingtonpost Travesty?
@LEBassett @AOC You must not understand politics.
@Independent Instead he called people jubronis and asked them if they smell what the rock is cooking.
@nypost So what? You pretty much draw backlash today for everything.
@Lovey4617 @nypost Is there anything that isn't the white man's fault?
@DanielStrauss4 What is your point?
@NYDailyNews What?
@ewarren Democrats are also involved in corruption.
@ATLBlackStar How many times can the guy say somebody is getting fired? He should be proud of himself he got somebody fired from McDonalds.
@Jasmyne @shaunking There is a reason why The Constitution says that people are supposed to be given an impartial trial by an impartial jury. You are the reason.
@Ilhan @IlhanMN Wow a Representative from Minnesota's 5th District is telling a Senator from South Carolina what to do. Let's see a person who represents 708,000 (2016) somehow believes that their voice is more powerful than a person who represents 5.024 million (2017) people. Delusional.
@people My pet is a he and you didn't use my gender approved pronoun.
@KamalaHarris McConnell is not running against you in your district. Are you trying to convince the people in Kentucky to vote for you or something?
@nypost Love Lindsey or Hate Lindsey he has been successful in politics for a good amount of time.
@nypost Lindsey Graham assumes that the people that vote for him want to 'Build a wall NOW'. Since 1993 Lindsey Graham has assumed correctly what the people in his district or state wanted him to do.
The ignorant find a corner to hide in. They learn about that corner and accept that as everything that there is to learn. Anyone that comes to their corner and says otherwise is wrong.
@SenFeinstein Fact Check: You have been in Congress since 1992, you know visa overstays are a problem, yet still nothing is done to fix it.
@SenFeinstein Fact Check: What are you going to do about visa overstays?
@tmorris504 @CBSNews Who hasn't tried this?
@CBSNews Register him to vote Democrats need all the help they can get. He can even bird box vote.
@jaketapper @SteveKingIA @RubensteinAdam Maybe you should go police speech in a country where it is not free. People say hurtful things to one another everyday in this country. I don't agree with what he said but I am not going to stop him from saying it. All men and women have errors in their way.
@people Hollywood should make this into a love story.
@TheSun Kinda seems like the actions don't match the words.
@charliekirk11 When you are a liberal it doesn't need to make sense you just have to say it.
@TheSun Just Great!! I am enjoying the view of the ocean and the sand and all of a sudden this walks in front of me.
@TheSun Full Mother-Mode? What in the ... is that?
@Richard47427195 @CNN Yeah the murder rate in the USA is exactly the same as Mexico. The people that commit the murders are exactly the same as well. Simplification is genius.
@RonWyden Democratic policies have been hurting the worker for years.
@TMZ The line is drawn at porn.
@Frankie66032693 @duffygirl8 @WhiteHouse She will get her boyfriend to do the math.
@nypost Every woman everywhere.
@nypost Yep we really have a competitive workplace in America. No wonder why people just demand a job when they fail a test.
@RonWyden Victims? People get laid off and fired everyday and you don't say anything.
@duffygirl8 @WhiteHouse Huh?
@WhiteHouse Quick register them to  vote for the Democrats.
@WhiteHouse CNN attempting to be Collusion News Network.
@jaketapper Is that supposed to be amazing, groundbreaking, and a historical first?
@CNNPolitics That is pretty hard to do. I am going to put it down as a win for the GOP.
@HurtHad2 Epic and Incredible
@AwardsDarwin Gorgeous.
@CNBC Is he going to declare a National Emergency to do it?
@AdamParkhomenko Most influential nonthinker of our time.
@Newsweek Vandalism is a crime. Go straight to jail.
@DailyMailCeleb Yep. This pretty much has R Kelly written all over it.
@DailyMailUK Stud. Brick S***house.
@washingtonpost Who him? No way.
@realDonaldTrump Most tremendous and incredible statement ever made.
@ABC That backfired on them.
@MailOnline Don't do it. It is the most sick and vile thing I have ever seen.
@DailyMailCeleb Huh?
@CNN People over 65 are the most wise.
@CNNPolitics Who is going to win? I think it is going into overtime. I will put current shutdown up by at least one by the end of the week. I got a lot of money riding on this game.
@AwardsDarwin @DeadLacedWard Incredible, amazing, genius, epic, and thrilling. Most influential person in the neighborhood.
@AP4Liberty You should work on your understanding.
@DailyMirror USC Ultimate Shopper's Championship. New idea of mine filing the trademark today.
@MSNBC This is like a temper tantrum. They are a luxury we can't afford.
@guardian There hasn't been a good movie in years.
@JessicaValenti @AOC Delusional Writing
@DailyMirror Words could have solved this problem.
@uptownloner @TheSun Yeah because the gay person would say ok.
@nytimes I say that everday.
@DailyMirror Women don't do this kind of stuff it is disgusting.
@GKCdaily So poor people listen up if you want to be rich buy a yacht.
@CNBC Oh yeah winners going to win. Just like Lebron says. Don't be hatin on the white man's success.
@MalcolmNance @JoyAnnReid I want to see the story about the mother who failed to watch her own kid.
@MalcolmNance @JoyAnnReid There are also bad people like the mother.
@AwardsDarwin Incredible and genius
@DailyMirror Is that why she loved him so much?
@CNN Probably working for a cartel.
@uptownloner @TheSun How does a man tell you to eat his female organ?
@BuzzFeed More confused liberal news. You can't check cat or dog on a birth certificate.
@WSJ @TedRall Nope wrong.
@uptownloner @TheSun Nope, false.
@USATODAY Why is my tax return filled out in crayon?
@Independent At cardboard gunpoint.
@DailyMirror Check into the asylum.
@ABC If Stormi did this she would have 200,000 viewers.
@DailyMirror The politicians will protect you with their speeches.
@CNN Nothing to see here this is an everyday occurence in Mexico.
@dtfromdc @nypost What?
@cali94612 @Look_In_Mirror @nypost Wrong
@USATODAY Woman flash people all the time. They also take a piss in the middle of a parking lot before the Phillies game.
@Amy_Siskind Check into the asylum. They have padded rooms where you can't hear anything and we can't hear you.
@maxberger You are crazy because you can't do that you are not the president. Also you seem to have a problem understanding words and there proper usage to describe situations.
@JoaoHen33584130 @Independent Hence why you don't work there either.
@TriciaM1917 Tell it to the courts.
@DailyMailUK Get a life.
@Newsweek Next feminist leader.
@Newsweek Most women suffer from this.
@politico Everybody loves Selena.
@TheSun This wasn't a homophobic rant it was heterosexual encouragement.
@DailyMailCeleb Rename them the Foo Fallers.
@DailyMailCeleb Lightweight
@DailyMail Hard to make a fool of this guy. Nothing pisses him off.
@PaigeCuccaro @CBSNews I have seen you driving. Can't be true.
@ABC Women do that kind of stuff on camera all the time just check porn websites.
@Newsweek True leader
@micahuetricht @CoreyRobin @samuelmoyn @IChotiner @rickperlstein @AOC Genius
@CoreyRobin @IChotiner @rickperlstein @AOC This tweet is genius.
@rickperlstein @CoreyRobin @IChotiner @AOC Genius
@CoreyRobin @IChotiner @rickperlstein @AOC Genius? That word gets thrown out a lot lately. More proof that liberals don't conserve they use.
@politico Lame
@THR Striking for others to pay more taxes.
@HuffPost Keep smoking drugs.
@HuffPost If you are a delusional anti-establishment socialist liberal then yes.
@redsteeze Propaganda.
@guardian Why did you do that?
@CBSNews His defense will be the remix to ignition.
@KassyDillon @DonaldJTrumpJr Put it in the asylum.
@TheRickWilson You are a Multi-Tweeter
@Independent He died for the cause.
@MailOnline Seemed like a good place to take a nap.
@DailyMail Heart warming moment the police actually catch the people that assaulted me.
@JessConditt @LoraDiCarlo_HQ Why do they need this if women think masturbation is disgusting?
@courtneywhytex Sad
@nypost So all the poor would be millionaires if they stop smoking. Poverty crisis solved.
@MirrorTech @DailyMirror It is only creepy when men do it.
@DailyMailUK Incredible?
@BuzzFeed Steal?
@luke_neo @Independent Democrats see her as a role model for the masses.
@Forbes Mostly because the boss disrespects us and our talent.
@MarkDice Never to late in life to learn.
@DailyMailUK More like fizzles.
@JosephNSanberg What if this is propaganda and a lie?
@DailyMailUK Still looking for something incredible in the pictures.
@Independent I don't feel bad.
@cnni Democratic Policies?
@DailyMailCeleb Look like clowns to me.
@MailOnline Women still disagree.
@ABC Maximum Penalty
@DailyMirror Psycho
@Independent People that watched this have the right to vote. How are they informed?
@HuffPost Anti-Establishment Socialist
@JDiamond1 Was that false?
@MailOnline Has the Democrats approval.
@DailyMailUK She was sick of work get over it.
@CBSNews Entitled
@neal_katyal @Lawrence @MSNBC @TheLastWord Propaganda
@TheIndyTV @Independent Never watched this show once.
@DailyMailCeleb We need more gladiators killing each other as entertainment like Rome had in the past to set us firward.
@DailyMailCeleb Wrestling and shoving tampons down people's throat has put us forward.
@Independent So what?
@NPR So we can spy on everyone
@CBSNews Vice Versa
@DailyMirror Go to jail.
@ScottPresler Socialist Democrats
@shaunking Hey did they catch the white guy who shot that 7 year old?
@shaunking Right back at you.
@shaunking LOL
@SenSanders The answer is America is a capitalist country where you have the right to patent your inventions and you are a socialist.
@SenSanders Socialist
@AOC Socialist
@AyannaPressley People call me it all the time especially Democrats.
@KamalaHarris There was a lot said in the past. We still accept immigrants you are a propagandist.
@CoryBooker Socialist
@Lawrence More like the people who cut down the trees.
@HuffPost No one
@ChuckCallesto Must be why the left loves her.
@people Everyone is Obsessed
@HenleyFrey71 @DailyMail This statement is not accurate how could you describe a METH pipe in a vagina as hot. Where is your proof?
@cnni epic
@people Incredible
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail You can go wait for the rest of your life.
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail Water is really land.
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail A bush grows upside down much like a drunk sunflower.
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail A bird is a fish with wings.
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail Cows are similar to elephants.
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail Turkey is really hamburger.
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail Wow you called me a name. I can barely go on after today.
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail I think that the more you talk the more we will be provided with statements that you think are facts but are really false.
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail 5. Being anonymous makes you look less stupid.	6. Johnathan has double digit IQ points. (No research needed)	7. The Left will come after you because you post things they don't like.
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail Let's see NATIONLIST's Facts		1. People haven't been open with their political ideas.	2. Johnathan knows nothing about history.	3. Johnathan is stupid to put his face on social media.	4. Doesn't need research to tell someone how stupid they are.
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail Was that another fact? You don't say.
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail Are you still talking?
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail I am so scared of that. I am shaking in your facts.
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail Go tell a frog not to ribbit.
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail People have been open with their political ideas since the beginning of time.
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail That would also be hilarious.
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail What happened to standing up and not being afraid?
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail You are hilarious.
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail I am not really a race warrior like you.
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail The reason you account is anonymous is because your first account broke the rules of twitter and got blocked.
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail You don't know what you are talking about.
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail No time to talk to you.
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail If I want to get angry I am going to get angry.
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail Ok are there white women in the left?
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail You don't have to do any research but I must state facts. Nobody should call you out when they think something isn't a fact.
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail Do I owe you an explanation?
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail It was a joke to start. You turned it into something serious.
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail Believe whatever you want to believe. Funny how what you believe isn't a fact.
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail Why does it matter what you think my IQ is?
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail https://t.co/wlSAstI2gW
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail https://t.co/BX3f165flC
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail https://t.co/f78MXDjURF
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail I have to explain myself to you. You may make any comment you want and pursue anything but I have to explain myself to you.
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail You are fighting the good fight.
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail You are going to call me a liar. Your are going to call me a cheat. You are going to win and be proven right.
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail Change the subject? You think you caught someone don't you? You really think you know what I meant by my comment. You did all the research. You just are so smart and you are going to catch me in my words.
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail You want a fact. You are a joke. You make a mockery of facts. If I sat here and provided you with fact after fact you would go away.  You would call me annoying. You would continuously insult me.
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail LOL! Saying something as stupid as I said. Have you looked across twitter lately?
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail You don't even have a face, nobody knows how old you are, your name is N A T I O N A L I S T.
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail You want to talk with me what is stupid?
@MercianInfidel @DailyMail It did say maybe.
@Lereko_RSA @DailyMirror That is what I thought. Move along.
@Lereko_RSA @DailyMirror If I am proven to be more capable than you will accept a life as my subordinate? If you are proven to be more capable than me will I?
@Lereko_RSA @DailyMirror Who appointed you to be master of me?
@Lereko_RSA @DailyMirror What makes your opinion wrong? What makes your opinion right?
@Lereko_RSA @DailyMirror Is your opinion my opinion?
@Lereko_RSA @DailyMirror If you don't like it why don't you just leave?
@Lereko_RSA @DailyMirror Is it the whites separated from the blacks or the blacks separated from the whites?
@Lereko_RSA @DailyMirror Where is the picture of the majority black school  with the whites separated?
@Lereko_RSA @DailyMirror What makes a wrong way of life? What makes a right way of life? Can a way of life be both wrong and right?
@Lereko_RSA @DailyMirror The past is over and if you hang on to it you will be left there.
@Lereko_RSA @DailyMirror You probably can't answer one of these questions honestly but you expect it out of me.
@Lereko_RSA @DailyMirror Is every person equal and capable of performing the same tasks?
@Lereko_RSA @DailyMirror Do all people learn the same?
@Lereko_RSA @DailyMirror Are you the teacher and am I the student? Did you invent the subjects taught in the school?
@Lereko_RSA @DailyMirror Since you feel superior what causes that?
@Lereko_RSA @DailyMirror Do you feel superior to me?
@Lereko_RSA @DailyMirror Why are you just a member of one political party?
@Lereko_RSA @DailyMirror Are you a member of multiple different political parties?
@Lereko_RSA @DailyMirror If they don't believe the same thing why should they stay together?
@Lereko_RSA @DailyMirror Why do they segregate themselves?
@Lereko_RSA @DailyMirror Did Christians and muslims attend the same church service?
@JBDC @bennyjohnson That is what the FDA is for.
@bennyjohnson She is the first woman to do her nails on national television while someone else was talking. Cue the liberal celebratory trumpets.
@RonWyden Neither can the government. What are you doing about that? Identity theft is a major problem.
@Lereko_RSA @DailyMirror Than I hope the person responsible for segragating them is repremanded and informed that that action is not allowed.
@MattWolking @SebGorka @MZHemingway @USATODAY @RyanW_Miller More proof that women are held to higher standards.
@SumerNow @JosiahHawthorne @TheJLV @IlhanMN LOL
@TMZ @etnow Yeah. Whatever.
@TIME Time is making a joke of the shutdown.
@SkyNewsBreak The government needs to protect these workers.
@Ilhan @SenSanders @RoKhanna You ignore the companies that have to make these drugs.
@brianschatz Do you know how many private companies had to shut their doors because they didn't make enough pay? Stop taxing the American people to pay for your communist and socialist ideals.
@brianschatz Why always protection for the government and not the working man?
@LGMandelaBarnes Wow the country is saved he got his name put on the door.
@CoryBooker @shaunking Never mind me I don't work for the government.
@CoryBooker @shaunking Notice how he only said Federal employee.
@CaughtCctv @AwardsDarwin That really cracked me up.
@CaughtCctv @AwardsDarwin Proof border walls don't work.
@ABC One man did this?
@DailyMirror This could have been handled better.
@nypost Liberal values
@holdmyale You have to love the voting public.
@DailyMail In addition what does marriage even mean anymore?
@DailyMailUK Because a tattoo is forever just like marriage in the 21st century.
I just saw a socialist buy a $4,000 pair of boots.
@Independent Liberals making a museum for their own. Always thinking about the poor and never using money for capitalist purposes.
There are some that think that there is nothing that should stand in their way. They believe that the are entitled to something. Anyone else that tries to take what they are entitled to is wrong. No other person deserves it more than them.
@MarkDice The worst offenders should be the focus.
@MarkDice America was never meant to be a police state.
For every happy story there is a sad one. For every tragedy there is triumph.
@DieterFrikadell @Independent True of some.
@Ebonafied @washingtonpost Laughable.
@Daily_Express The US does not need any defensive barriers or tools.
It is not our duty to trample the rights of others but rather to protect our own.
@DieterFrikadell @Independent Sorta like every company everywhere.
It is not important who is laughing now but rather who laughs last.
@CapehartJ Can't you find the answer to your own question?
@ConnieSchultz Write more stories about dogs and have a political bias in factual stories. Also stop doing investigative journalism.
If the pay is to be the same the demands, requirements, and expectations must also reflect this fact.
@seungminkim Your weakness is showing.
@MirrorCeleb @DailyMirror Those two are standing in the way of my view of the advertisements.
@TMZ Hire all the Felons.
@RainyDayPeople5 @TMZ Drug dealers, thiefs, and murderers are ok to listen.
@IndyLife @Independent I don't know ask a woman.
@odbahena @AOC Looks like a race issue for you.
@odbahena @AOC Not even Obama? Or any of the Irish immigrants?
@EBONYMag @ZerlinaMaxwell @AyannaPressley This is only a story because a woman did it.
@AlrantAl @Newsweek Abortion
@DailyMail Maybe because they hate white men?
@Independent So he is secretly rooting for the immigrants?
@Newsweek Very good advice.
@DailyMailUK Liberal values
@CNN Just get an abortion nothing unethical about that.
@DailyMirror Sick, disqusting,vile just a few words I would use to describe this act.
@TMZ Time to retire.
@Independent Very good use of money.
@DailyMailCeleb People actually eat breakfast???
@Pope_Bane @guardian Hope it doesn't rain.
@guardian Men are pigs. Oh wait the person is a woman. Men are pigs.
@MirrorRoyal @DailyMirror Royal Purse Buyer???
@DailyMirror Surpruse!!!!!😛😛😛😛
@carolynporco This is more like a "temper tantrum" than courage.
@Newsweek He might have got that opinion from his brother and father.
@LarryGorkin1 @thetimes Who needs facts?
@thetimes Laughable.
@kylegriffin1 His side was it was a waist of time. Way to imply intent and motive.
@DLoesch @foxandfriends It is all in the words they use.
@TMZ Laughable.
@Newsweek She should sing it to them in a song.
@blacknewszone Some people even said the guy who did this was a terrorist.
@Newsweek Laughable.
@faith_lvs @RealKarlandK What if she by definition has an attitude?
@TIME Amazing. Don't even have to work to become rich.
@DailyMirror If the accusations are proven untrue I hope the person who made them is sued.
@LESTRENTtv @Mediaite @Acosta @CNN I actually have been assaulted.
@greggutfeld Just don't fact check AOC.
@replucymcbath Infringement.
@AC360 @HurdOnTheHill Why did it take so long to raise the minimum wage?
@LESTRENTtv @Mediaite @Acosta @CNN You need to learn the definition of the word assault before you use it.
@BillKristol Conspiracy theorist.
@freedominguez @SenKamalaHarris @TheView @AOC This was a vanity project.
@michaelmalice Not even close to being the same.
@KamalaHarris Expunging marijuana offenses from people's record is a vanity project.
@RielyFrancis @dmwoof @RepJeffries Or the Erie Canal?
@RepJeffries Now it is a ransom.
@RepEscobar Why are men ignored? Why is it not a humanitarian crisis for men as well? How did Trump force these people to come to the border?
@HuffPost Comedians tell jokes. Kevin Hart is being Kevin Hart. He was born that way.
German Sheppards need more to eat that Shih Tzus and each performs a particular task and has a value.
A dog is not loyal if it is not fed.
@eviefordham @DailyCaller She just wants an easier time staging a revolution.
@SumerNow @JosiahHawthorne @TheJLV @IlhanMN Sounds more like what you believe rather than the truth.
@AnnaDsays If the light stays on, it could indicate a malfunction in the TRAC/VSC system itself.
@AnnaDsays From Google:	Slip Indicator. If the system indicates your tires may be slipping, the slip indicator flashes to indicate that Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) and/or Traction Control (TRAC) are operating in order to regain traction.
@AnnaDsays That is the slip indicator.
@AnnaDsays There is a booklet in your glove compartment that explains what all of the dash lights mean.
@RealJamesWoods Confidence in self.
@DailyMirror I am a man who never went to any party destination and caught a super-gonorrhoea strain. Tell me again how I am a pig.
@CPaine10 @CBSNews @annawerner These people are all capable of thinking for themselves.
@CPaine10 @CBSNews @annawerner America must have the most law breakers of any other country.
@CPaine10 @CBSNews @annawerner There is not a single country in the world that does not have laws and punishes people who break those laws.
@CPaine10 @CBSNews @annawerner In one way or another regardless of who he voted for he is stuck in the system that was created long ago.
@CBSNews @annawerner The government has more responsibilities than him.
@nypost Very generous man to give a part of yourself to another.
@BuzzFeed Ok. Don't get divorced in the future.
In terms of the science and knowledge that is available today compared to that of the start of the USA, there are many leaders that exist that are smarter than our founding fathers of the past. In terms of brilliance and IQ it is hard to compare.
@KamalaHarris If she was president there would still be an immigration system. Just like Obama and Clinton and every president before.
@KamalaHarris This statement is a mischaracterization of what was actually said.
When did it suddenly become American to tax people at 70%?		https://t.co/pqeeMNMFWB
@mkraju @Lawrence What happened to having two ears and one mouth?
@TheSun Why can't punishment instead be to teach her to better mother?
@BuzzFeed And that probably would be considered illegal.
@nypost Here we go again.
@CNNPolitics Unfortunately insulting the president does change the current situation.
@AOC You are under a microscope. What they are doing to you is what they have done to every person before you.
@nypost What could possibly go wrong?
@JohnCleese You can't learn anything from reading everybody knows that.
@AriMelber I am calling BS.
@Independent Backlash from who?
@TheSun I agree 100%. This sexism needs to be stopped. Men are not here to be the tools of women.
@THR How can you sue them for their opinion of you?
When one chooses the world outside for their life the world inside rejects them.
@MarkYoungTruth She cares for the next child who would have a better life that is why she retires.
@MarkYoungTruth They are the people who failed the public school system and not vice versa.
@DailyMail The Democrats make a mockery of the voting public every day.
@justicedems @AOC Why is what she lived what we all need?
@TheSun I didn't want to hear that.
@GOP Proves they are all racist.
@DailyCaller Very good move Jerry Jones is the man.
@charliekirk11 Yep change the current demographics and makeup of the voting public of a country in order to undermine them and install their own political ideology.
@DanaBashCNN Well, eventually the Shutdown will end.
@TheSun I didn't want to see this.
@HuffPost See the thing is Democrats advocated for Nuclear Power on the basis that it was a safer more environmentally friendly alternative to coal.		https://t.co/ZWufqHwPpE		https://t.co/WRm8nhFJVO		https://t.co/RR11xYjDne
@TheDailyShow Are you saying that Stephen Miller is a cannibal?
@HuffPost Takes one to know one.
@MailOnline I looked at the picture but didn't know why I was stressed until after I read the article so it took more like minutes.
@DailyMailCeleb She fooled me.
@DailyMailUK Why doesn't the first one have any clothing on?
@DailyMailUK I thought she would be more interested in showing off her college degree.
@TheSun Don't put sticky balls in your hair. Didn't even need to read her message.
@DailyMirror How come the husband looks like a woman?
@AwardsDarwin How did he not see that?
@enews Where do I sign up to become rich by dancing around half nude?
@Daily_Express She can ask other people but other people can't ask her. Typical female BS.
@StormyDaniels She probably thought she was going to be his next wife.
@Acosta At least his address was environmentally friendly. You think liberals would have liked that.
@Independent The plot thickens.
@RachelMcGonagi1 @AndrewGillum @realDonaldTrump I am starting a youtube channel.
@AndrewGillum @realDonaldTrump Not for you.
@TheSun It was just a white guy with a knife who got shot no story here.
@HuffPost We need another bailout for the finance industry.
@CBSNews Definitely racism.
@MirrorFighting @DailyMirror How come this guy won't go to the bar and pick a fight? Those guys at the bar get pretty strong after they drink beer. I think beer should be put on the banned substance list.
@DailyMailUK How dare somebody that is paid to say something actually say something? I am watching something else.
@CharlesHurt Can't wait for Term Limits.
@regency31 @TheSunFootball @TheSun You love animals more than humans because animals are the only thing that will actually sit a listen to your opinions.
@sala57062664 @davinci_truth @TheSunFootball Give me attention for my looks.
@Independent Nobody wants to know what it means.
@TheSun I wear leopard print jumpsuits all the time. It is a completely sane and normal thing to do.
@TheSunFootball Is there any a time when  a woman doesn't try to expose their ex as a psycho when they are the one who is actually the psycho.
@votolatino @AOC The crime in her district is higher than the US average.		https://t.co/00oFXdaA79
@votolatino @AOC I think I am going to talk a walk through her district to see if I feel unsafe of not.
@DailyMailUK Oh it was just a white guy that got shot and killed no civil rights issue here. He probably was racist.
@voxdotcom Yawn. All those gringos keep coming to my Spanish country.
@TheSun They finally caught Sir Rapealot.
@Newsweek This is completely sexist to use words like that when describing a man.
@MikeBrann1 @HuffPost I meant in terms of who voted for him.
@pdxlawgrrrl How come you aren't mad about this?		https://t.co/pPpXgMG41Y
@pdxlawgrrrl Sounds like the guy resisted arrest and pulled a knife on officers.

@lynncjohnston @tomforutah @Lawrence It is a first in history.
@tomforutah Was the last President that caused a shutdown impeached?
@RVAwonk @Acosta Democrats are the ones who believe in censorship of speech.

@IlhanMN Free Airtime?
@cakecasian @KamalaHarris @AOC @RashidaTlaib @TimRyan This is known as woman grouping. The intentional grouping of women regardless of the correctness of their views in an attempt to be more threatening than a man whose view is correct in an attempt ot silence him. I have seen a lot of this  grouping lately. It is completely sexist.
@NewsForThinkers @KamalaHarris 10 % is too much unless they are terrorists crossing the southern border than Trump doesn't know anything at all because liberals say so.
@KamalaHarris Neither will any policy you make I know because you were AG and these people still exist.
@RealJamesWoods Umm California is not allowed to make rules involving immigration. Immigration is a federal issue.
@Independent Only a liberal is capable of masterminding such an act of revenge.
@HuffPost Liberals have made worst comparisons but the HuffPost is a liberal wrag.
@OurRevolution @AOC She is anti-American.
@KNayyeh Big Bird and Barney
@racdp @AOC She should go see a mental health counselor.
@RashidaTlaib This tweet is completely sexist. Listen to how she used the word rant.
@jstandridge4 @MeritLaw That depends is it a white guy?
@MeritLaw The black men that did this are monsters.

@nekseka @DailyMail You want to get married.
@missy_missy1974 @DailyMail The white man the racist bigot one and only.
@TMZ I be afraid to let him host because he might say the word gay.
@DailyMail He will be having a lot of what he wanted.
@nypost You found my penny I dropped that.
@CNNPolitics It is only one satellite. The threat is grossly exaggerated.
@DailyMail Definitely a setup by the white man.
@CNNPolitics There is no threat here it is fiction.
@AOC @maddow You should get up and dance on the counter.
@nypost I was going to try and say something sarcastic and funny but I think the headline speaks for itself.
@buddha_envoy @CNNPolitics He just has to move to Florida. He can register to vote once his prison term is over.
@nypost If you think about it you realize that the white man set him up this is entrapment.
@CNNPolitics Something isn't right here. I think the white man is setting him up.
@TheBeatWithAri @AriMelber Laptops are dying off at pretty fast pace.
@KamalaHarris Propaganda of Kamala Harris = Tell everyone the shutdown is Trump's fault and point out all the negatives to make him look bad and her look good so she can get re-elected (IMO).		TRUTH.
@cnni Liberals will share it with everyone.
@SenateDems There is a reason why this guy is a FORMER DHS Secretary.
@Lawrence I am going to the Des Moines to become a waitress in hopes to start a movie career on a farm.
@LouDobbs Lou, Do you think I could get $1,000 for my answer? It is considered talking and that is what you get paid to do.
@HuffPost Yeah she will do that.
@usatodayvideo Umm what does the word infringed mean again.
@YMcprivilege @CNBC I predicted that your tweet would be labeled as offensive you need to curb your language like Rashida Tlaib. Speak more like a US Representative. #SayMFer
@CNBC Am I the only person that thinks it was a genius idea to dress the guy up as a receipt and make him a white man since California wants to get rid of them (  I mean receipts ).
@SenSanders Why? You are a Senator. You need to just address the people in your state. Nobody else voted for you in other states.
@DailyMail Clinton always told the truth Trump should be held to the same standard.
@TheSun Liberal ideology says open everything. Open Borders, Open Bathrooms, just make it open. The cashiers are supposed to clean that up.
@NYPDDetectives @NYCHA @NYPDTips @NYPDHousing @NYPDPSA3 @NYPD90Pct Get Shaun King involved in this. He just help catch that monster in Houston that killed that 7 year old girl.
@nypost Why does the racist criminal justice system keep arresting these people?
@DailyMail She was just trying to be a good liberal.
@MarkDice Don Lemon just want him to you know what I mean.
@DailyCaller We need to secure the Canadian border because we are all racist and there are violent cartels creating havoc all over Mexico and Central America.
@JosiahHawthorne @TheJLV @IlhanMN Congratulations you got Dildo Baggins to like you.
@RiggsMarting @DailyCaller You can't say always.
@RiggsMarting @DailyCaller They are fleeing their countries because the countries are much too violent. All people from Mexico and Central America are non-violent.

@EricRobinson00 @IlhanMN Congratulations.
@TheJLV @IlhanMN Stop committing crimes.
@SenSanders He probably can't even answer.
@SenSanders How many of those workers reside in Vermont?
@RealJamesWoods No I wouldn't do this.
@Independent I represent the 14th District and Puerto Rico.
@Independent Tax the rich to pay for Puerto Rico's debt.
@AngelaKinsey Yeah because the media can make a spectacle out of anything even a woman carrying water.
@Independent People don't actually get fired for that.
@Independent Maybe if he forgives Puerto Rico's debt she will like him. It is unjust that people that spend money have to pay it back.
@guardian One of the most important questions of our time.
@markbrown70 @DailyMailUK Who the Animal Rights Activists who send out numerous death threats and harass people?
@DailyMailUK Once again the focus is on one side. What did the other side do?
@jaketapper Since we are all allowed to biased in our reports, the way I see it Trump is the biggest most powerful civil right icon conducting the most tremendous and meaningful boycott in American history.
@noelJoh82360055 @CNNPolitics Sorry to hear that.
@jaketapper Liberals are all about making history so that must be a good thing.
@YellowstoneDJ @USATODAY How does $3 million sound but it is given to you in a duffel bag while you are in Mexico?
@CNNPolitics The Oklahoma City bombing was carried out by one person.
@CNNPolitics CNN goes from warning the world about lone wolves to saying that 12 people are barely a threat.
@CNNPolitics About a dozen people carried out the terrorist attack on September 11th. One person carried out the terrorist attack in Las Vegas. What is your point?
@will_silenced @USATODAY If we tax the rich fires and hurricanes will stop.
@USATODAY Thanks to Affirmative Action we have armies full of qualified people to save us from these catastrophes.
@Newsweek That was a genius comparison.
@MarkDice Liberals have foot in mouth disease.
@Newsweek I am surprised the lawyers for the hospital didn't claim she was the reincarnation of Mary and it is a virgin birth.
@SkyNews These fatbergs are caused by the irresponsibility of the people and what they flush down their toilets.
@Newsweek The only reason people watch Seth Meyers is that after a full workday anything becomes entertaining.
@Newsweek That comparison is accurate if you are like a clown working as a judge like Seth Meyers.
@TMZ She had a butt feeling she was innocent.
@KarenAttiah @shaunking Are you going to send the troops in and get a manicure while they are fighting?
@HuffPost Great message for the children as well.
@cnni In case CNN is confused to how the world works, the police also come and take and sabotage your stuff when you are from the right wing you are homeless and some rich liberal from NY complains.
@TheIndyTV @Independent She would be an actress.
@TheSun He sounds like the creepy government.
@TheSun Ok but they just inflicted violence on him.
@AOC All of those things have been stated before by other Democrats. How does that make you radical?
@DanCrenshawTX You mean like deplorables or magats.

@CathoConser @nypost What am I confused about? When did I agree with her? What are you talking about?		What if the people you are lying too are morally wrong?
@nypost Seems like a willing accomplice to me. Why are there no charges brought against her?
@CathoConser @nypost Morals are different depending on the person you talk with. Facts are always the same.
@Nopoliticalgirl @TIME I think I just lost my cultural identity because of your tweet. I would rather die.
@CathoConser @nypost If you think about it a liar calling a liar a liar actually might be telling the truth.
@CathoConser @nypost No I meant to say that she is a liar calling a liar a liar.
@CathoConser @nypost This guy is a liar and a conman don't believe him. Hey can I interest you in some snake oil.
@nypost It is unfair that she is slamming critics already because she has only been in office for a little bit of time. Sarah Sanders waited for at least a month before doing this. 😀😃😄😁😆😅😂🤣		You can't slam me but I can slam you.
@jaketapper That would be an opinion.
@nypost I think the over was 9,000 so anyone that took the under is in the money.
@TIME OMG! Germany just allowed them to enter the country to flee the threat of being killed and there is a complaint already.
@people What is worse a saying racial slur or feeding someone a tampon?
@CNN @CNNOpinion The Founding Fathers and all other politicians that have ever existed failed miserably at making a tax plan but a Rep from NY 14th District is a genius. Coming to you live from CNN.
@archi1210 @DailyCaller New legislation needs to be passed to protect her from fact checkers.
@DailyCaller You check my facts more than you check his facts. 😥😥😥
@shaunking Hopefully during his prison sentence he can find the error in his ways. Will you forgive him then?
@ChinaDaily Amazing! Who could have imagined the creation of such a thing?
@jaketapper @jeffzeleny @TheLeadCNN He makes the initial decision. Ultimately, the people will decide if they want him as president or not.

@FLVMXNGO_BVRNXS @BPJJ22 @TwitterMoments The defendant told Bryant about the charges she was facing, and Bryant overheard a conversation between the defendant and Williamson in which the defendant “basically said this guy that she was talking to used to send her out to prostitute. And she was mad at him.
@FLVMXNGO_BVRNXS @BPJJ22 @TwitterMoments She said she was NOT a Prostitute however evidence:		Shayla Bryant testified that in November 2004, while in jail, the defendant spoke to her and two other inmates, Lashonda Williamson and Sheila Washington, about the victim’s death.
@FLVMXNGO_BVRNXS @BPJJ22 @TwitterMoments According to Franz, the defendant told her, “I’m going to do you like I did him, but I’m not going to shoot you once in the back of the head. I’m going to shoot you three times and listen while your blood splatters on the wall.”
@FLVMXNGO_BVRNXS @BPJJ22 @TwitterMoments Franz said that one day, the defendant asked her to use the telephone. Franz told the defendant that she could not use the telephone, at which point the defendant grabbed her by the hair and by the face; after that, the two women struggled and “both wound up [on] the floor.”
@FLVMXNGO_BVRNXS @BPJJ22 @TwitterMoments Testimony of Richard Reed:		Reed said that the defendant told him that she had “shot somebody in the head for fifty thousand dollars and some guns.” The defendant asked him for a ride to the victim’s house to “help her clean it out,” but Reed declined the offer.
@FLVMXNGO_BVRNXS @BPJJ22 @TwitterMoments This would reflect shooting someone who had their head laid down in a sleeping position:		Officer Baker’s test of the pillowcase led him to conclude that the gun used to shoot the victim was held three to six inches from the pillow at the time it was fired.
@FLVMXNGO_BVRNXS @BPJJ22 @TwitterMoments They said it looked like he was shot while sleeping. Not while reaching for something under the bed.
@FLVMXNGO_BVRNXS @BPJJ22 @TwitterMoments During the interview, the defendant denied that she was a prostitute, denied having sex with the victim, and insisted that the victim, who was nude when found by police, was not nude when he got into the bed with her.
@FLVMXNGO_BVRNXS @BPJJ22 @TwitterMoments She pulled out a .40 caliber handgun, which she had bought “from somewhere off the street” approximately three weeks before this incident, and shot the victim.
@FLVMXNGO_BVRNXS @BPJJ22 @TwitterMoments Her Defense:	The defendant said that she then saw the victim reaching underneath the bed, which led the defendant to believe that the victim was reaching for a gun. The defendant, fearing for her life, reached into her handbag, which was on a night stand to the right of the bed.
@FLVMXNGO_BVRNXS @BPJJ22 @TwitterMoments Ok thank you.
@nypost This person should have reached out for help.
@FLVMXNGO_BVRNXS @BPJJ22 @TwitterMoments Like you said I didn't read the story surrounding this case. This is why I am trying to be careful with my words. From what I hear from your words, the courts are excusing her illegal behavior on the basis of she was a victim of illegal behavior herself.
A sick mind cannot think healthily until it is well.
This person was released on $5000 bond. It doesn't seem that the person who set her bail takes her threats too seriously.		Mass shooter-loving stripper threatens violent killing spree: cops https://t.co/uCVv9DDE2h via @nypost
@FLVMXNGO_BVRNXS @BPJJ22 @TwitterMoments I find that to be a miscarriage of justice if of course it is the real reason she was freed. People demanded the Barabbas be freed and he was both a murderer and thief. If what Captain Ron Mexico is true the person who was just granted clemency is the same. Strange isn't it.
The trophy is meaningless when compared to the struggle that was required to achieve it.
@RealJamesWoods When a Jewish patient goes into that hospital how can they be certain that they are getting the proper diagnoses after a doctor there says something like this?
@TomPelissero LOL! Maybe they should go back and historically change all of the bad calls and no calls they made. #WhooptyDoo
@moekamerow @nypost Who determines what is the bigger sin?
@moekamerow @nypost I know CNN openly hires a guy that says stuff like that.
@godzilla85 @nypost Right all these people are surprised when someone talks to them that way.
@sahluwal This is sick. That police officer scares me.
@BPJJ22 @TwitterMoments If this is the truth why is she being granted clemency?
@nypost How to go to prison 101.
@TwitterMoments If there is evidence to support the claim of sex trafficking and there is legally justified reason for the killing like self-defense than why shouldn't she be free?
The question "Who cares?" is fundamentally flawed because it encourages people to not.
@felipeliberman @dbongino People cared enough to watch the golden globes. I feel like it was a joke mixed with his true feeling of Dick.

@gabrielcio @APCentralRegion @AP 1. You don't know what Teddy Roosevelt would do as you are not Teddy nor is he alive.	2. In your opinion the GOP is a shell. What evidence makes them a shell?
@gabrielcio @APCentralRegion @AP 6. You say that he is enriching himself at the expense of the country. If he is doing this illegally it supposed to be stopped by the Congress and/or the appropriate branch of government.
@gabrielcio @APCentralRegion @AP 1. You have an opinion that I am dumb that does not make me dumb.	2. I never said he was a rich guy you did.	3. He says his companies declared bankruptcy not him.	4. You have an opinion that he is a pathological liar.	5. What does him cheating on his wife have to do with me?
@gabrielcio @APCentralRegion @AP 5. In your opinion he is using the GOP. Everyone in the GOP has a mind of their own.
@gabrielcio @APCentralRegion @AP 1. You missed the point of my tweet as evidenced in your first sentence.	2. In your opinion Trump is a conman.	3. There is nothing wrong with being the rich kid down the street.	4. If he is the rich guy down the street that pretends to be a tough guy you are the poor guy.
@PINK1963DSW @CNNPolitics A press secretary is not a police officer or court officer.
@shaunking Oh so you mean it wasn't race related.
@DailyMirror He should not be a police officer I am glad they fired him.
@Independent Maybe he was being sarcastic?
@HannahofHawaii @cnni I would say the original meaning is no more and therefore it has lost its meaning.
@HannahofHawaii @cnni Post Obama definition:	The legally or formally recognized union of two people or one person and a hologram as partners in a personal relationship
@is_kizito @cnni Who do we have to thank for such sad events?
@HannahofHawaii @cnni 100 % proof. 		Previous definition of marriage: 	the legally or formally recognized union of man and woman as partners in a personal relationship 		Obama era definition:	The legally or formally recognized union of two people as partners in a personal relationship
@cnni More proof		https://t.co/9Sk25zgPCU
@cnni This proves marriage has lost its meaning.
@YuliAppCom @cnni How else would you know about something?
@CNNPolitics Is impersonating a press secretary a crime? Show me the law.
@keniakiki @Thomason97J @Independent I am not a perfect person. Maybe I am missing something. You might be missing something as well.
@keniakiki @Thomason97J @Independent The UK could have felt sympathy for him since he lost his parents. I don't know what the truth is I am just reading the article. The article doesn't say if the parents were citizens or not. It doesn't say if his parents filed the proper paperwork to become a citizen.
@keniakiki @Thomason97J @Independent Everybody always wants to see papers.
@BFamous4 @nypost I would love for you to be arrested by her.
@nypost I thought that what was important in being a cop was to do your job. Where is it a requirement to be hot?
@Thomason97J @Independent Get deported to the UK the country that he claims he is a citizen of? You are right it was 9 months.
@Thomason97J @Independent Excuse me. He pays taxes to the government not to be oppressed by the government. If they have the information they are obligated to provide it to him. They cannot withhold evidence that is relevant to his case.
@Thomason97J @Independent I said if what he said is TRUE he should be compensated. He was also jailed for 9 years on a false charge.
@Thomason97J @Independent He may have been born to a UK citizen thus he also would be a citizen at birth. That is what I was referring.
@Thomason97J @Independent Nothing in the article states that they were. There may be evidence elsewhere. Shouldn't the government have this evidence?
@Thomason97J @Independent Sorry but the article does not state if one of his parents was a citizen or not. You don't know that fact either.
@Thomason97J @Independent A child born in the UK does not automatically receive British citizenship by birth. For a child to be registered as a British citizen at birth, one or more parent will need to hold British Citizenship or 'settled status'.
@Thomason97J @Independent Weren't his parents citizens?
@Thomason97J @Independent The whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God. Your statement is false as it does not include all evidence relevant to this case.
@Thomason97J @Independent He only did that because his passport was lost. He was a a legal citizen born in the UK and his parents died on vacation to Ghana when he was 5. The only reason he did that was to get back into is home country because his passport was lost according to the story.
If women don't want you before you have money but want you after you have money they still don't want you.
@DailyMirror The only reason I would track him down is to get money from him.
@CNNPolitics If she violated the law where is the prosecution. Some people shouldn't be able to violate laws while others are prosecuted. This is completely unfair.
@RealJamesWoods Just don't say gay because you won't be able to host the Oscars. Say MFer and you can be a member of congress. We are all treated equally by Democrats.
@Newsweek How is it any different than someone else that is being a critic? He may work for CNN but he is still a person under the law and is therefore granted no more right than the person next to him.
@Newsweek Don Lemon is pretty much a critic of everyone that says or does something he doesn't like.
@Independent If what this guy says is true I feel that the UK government owes him compensation.
@WayneDupreeShow Why would he need to put a mirror up he isn't the one who said that?
@WayneDupreeShow Trump' match. She was elected by her district he was elected by the country. How is that a match?
@yashar @donlemon People don't have to apologize to you for what they are allowed to say legally by law.
@gabrielcio @APCentralRegion @AP So Trump is bad because he uses threatening language but you are good.

@historicity @bschapiroMD I don't know what you are talking about.
@dbongino A wall can be scaled, tunneled under, or broken through. The ultimate purpose of a wall is to slow or thwart the person who is trying to enter. There still must be someone present to stop the advancement of the person trying to enter.		https://t.co/sGsI3QE5Ro
@nypost I wish her the best of luck in her position but I don't understand why the media is building her up so much other than to set her up for a bigger fall. This type of attention brings the wrong eyes. Everyone is watching her so she must be more careful in everything she does.
@cnni @camanpour @CNNOpinion I think that some journalists have a political bias and are unethical. These journalists are called out. I also think that there are people who are immoral and unethical that attempt to silence ethical and unbiased journalists.

@MarkYoungTruth @AOC It is liberal speak not based on facts or reality.
@bschapiroMD @davidhogg111 The only thing that shouldn't be in the classroom is that kid that started that fight.
@bschapiroMD Ok then the student that does that would go to prison for a long time. You could make the same argument for cops not having guns or people with concealed carry permits not having guns because someone could grab it.
@bschapiroMD Why is this a reason guns shouldn't be in the classroom?
@DevNublets @APCentralRegion @AP You sound like a guy who says he is a Republican and are actually a liberal. Your post was made to make it look like I did something wrong but I didn't. To me she still looks like a liberal even after you said something.
@ellehitter @johnmccoin13 @TalbertSwan Slavery was abolished by law in 1865.
@gabrielcio @APCentralRegion @AP You think that because you are a son of a woman who worked that you can threaten me and tell me to be quiet. I don't really care if you want to fight me and honestly you are not that scary.
@Cock4ndPussy @nypost Well that is pretty much all newspapers do anymore. They only tell one side of the story.
@JonL1966 @nypost That is just what the original tweet said.
@BreitbartNews He lost to Ted Cruz.
@gabrielcio @APCentralRegion @AP I didn't realize that was legal. Are we allowed to do that? I would be afraid the cops would arrest me for assault or making terroristic threats.
@bellmardesigns @APCentralRegion @AP You really think I would follow any of your advice. I didn't kill anyone the she did. Not a very intellectual opinion you have.
@Independent The companies she applies for work that she expects to hire her on the basis of her beauty should label her as misandronistic.		How is a man that wants to see a woman nude misogynistic? By nature he likes women and not hates them hence why he is asking for nudes.
@smellsliketom @APCentralRegion @AP Seems like you followed your own advice.
@Independent There are countless number of women that share nude photos with men. There are also women who engage in illegal prostitution with men to make money. There are countless numbers of women in porn and posting softcore porn on instagram. Why is it that men are judged as misogynistic?
@bellmardesigns @APCentralRegion @AP I don't even know what you are talking about. Republicans all were children once. In order to grow up their Republican families had to care for them. I was saying you were liberal on the basis of what you said. Nobody takes you seriously.
@Newsweek It is a sad day for nobody.
@MSNBC Michelle Obama walks all over the poor with her $4,000 boots.
@MSNBC Yeah but Michelle Obama says that she cares about the poor and disenfranchised.  When do the poor and disenfranchised ever wear $4,000 boots? She isn't a fashion icon she is wife to husband who was President that won on the basis of him caring for the oppressed and poor.

@emilyslist @AyannaPressley @Deb4CongressNM @sharicedavids @IlhanMN @RashidaTlaib @Abby4Iowa @LaCongresista @vgescobar @JanetMillsforME @Lizzie4Congress @HornForCongress @LaurenUnderwood Taking power? I though they were just elected to represent the districts that voted for them.
@DavidKlion Democrats hate money and love the people.
@Chris79699884 @HuffPost What you think that some people should get handouts and others should not?
@DailyMirror This is what all of America would look like after liberals get done passing their free everything policies. There is nothing wrong with him he is perfectly normal anyone that says otherwise is a bully and a shamer.
@TheSun Pure liberal.
@Independent What is the story? He felt uncomfortable as a customer so he asked for his money back. This happens all the time.
@MSNBC The Democratic party will excuse incompetency and abuse in order to gain diversity.
@IngrahamAngle Half of the stuff she said didn't make sense or was incomplete.
@NYTNational Excuse me but the US is not Palestine. She represents the 13th District of Michigan not Palestine.
@stephanielily @RashidaTlaib Actually I think that people like @RashidaTLaib are a bigger threat to the country. Liberal news outlets spent countless hours bashing Trump because of his language.
@nypost Sounds like something a liberal would do. Liberals made her popular.
@AnandWrites Because when you have a lot of money what do you buy.
@nypost Looks liberal.
@bellmardesigns @APCentralRegion @AP You look liberal as well.
@RLyons116 @APCentralRegion @AP It is amazing how politically correct liberals can be.
@gabrielcio @APCentralRegion @AP That is a very liberal thing to say. Liberals think women like you are so brave.
@molta_sporco @APCentralRegion @AP You sound like a liberal. It is funny how you condemn what I say but not what she does.
@cshield0125 @APCentralRegion @AP You should call her and ask her what political party she is a member of and who she voted for. To me she looks like somebody that would vote for Barrack Obama and Hillary Clinton. I am not sure but I think she is a liberal.
@DevNublets @APCentralRegion @AP She has the classic liberal face piercing.
@smellsliketom @APCentralRegion @AP She does look liberal to me by the way.
@smellsliketom @APCentralRegion @AP Attempting to silence ones speech is considered targeted harassment and Twitter will block your account. Saying shut up is attempting to silence my voice.
@Speedsbest @APCentralRegion @AP No actually grew up raised by liberals. Your guess is wrong and that doesn't surprise me because you sound like a liberal. Don't worry Kamela Harris will let her vote from prison.
@REWhitneyIII @Slippydip1 @WSJ @jasongay Nobody ever complains about my service. People are all so nice today.
@rmayemsinger Yep focusing on a woman's hair is sexist and objectification but a woman making a joke about a man's hair is brilliant. The left really is the most inconsistent bunch of people.
@APCentralRegion @AP My guess is liberal.
@APCentralRegion @AP Yep but women don't do anything wrong.
@Slippydip1 @WSJ @jasongay Your going to tell me what to do. These people on Twitter be talkin' to me like masta'. Little fella? Ok boy.
@cahorn5150 @MatthewJshow @ASavageNation Talking to you is like trying to convince a cat that thinks it is a dog that it is really a cat. You bark even though by nature you meow. I tell you to meow and you bark.
@Slippydip1 @WSJ @jasongay Talking with Democrats is a waste of time because they have their foot in their mouth 85% of the time.
@Slippydip1 @WSJ @jasongay Black people never complain about service or product. Is that what you just said?
@jamestaranto They just try to make it look like they are the David or the underdog fighting against the Goliath or powerful. Just look at all their words. They always take the stance of victim to oppressors. They are no more Goliath than Goliath himself.
@cahorn5150 @MatthewJshow @ASavageNation Word tricks and deceit. No point in talking to you. Lies to gain power.
@ReneJaspers @VanLathan Show me how a poor man and a rich man sit down at a table and truthfully agree on everything?
@cahorn5150 @MatthewJshow @ASavageNation Look at it any way that you want.
@TomFitton @politico The Democrats are going to become more and more divided as their diversity push goes on.
@rachaelmbade Just proves that the Democrat side is going to become more divided.
@TomFitton @politico It is a constant ongoing thing.
@RonWyden The way I see it is you are just as much to blame.
@cahorn5150 @MatthewJshow @ASavageNation Oh I forgot you want peace.
@cahorn5150 @MatthewJshow @ASavageNation See you on the battlefield.
@KamalaHarris Hence why you want to bring ill-informed people to the polls to vote.
@people Is he going to sing anti-semetic lyrics as theme song for the wellness program.
@cahorn5150 @MatthewJshow @ASavageNation Do you have green hair and your nose pierced with a tattoo on your face while being confused about your gender?
@cahorn5150 @MatthewJshow @ASavageNation Are all your cousins and siblings in jail?
@cahorn5150 @MatthewJshow @ASavageNation You high on weed. Did you register all your dead relatives to vote?
@BowsandBrew @IlhanMN Democrats said Trump should stop tweeting. Now they are proud of the two females elected that don't stop tweeting. Who cares what anybody says about anything anymore?
@nypost Maybe his little girl started the fight in the first place.
@HuffPost @MSignorile I don't agree. Huffington Post is a liberal rag.
@MatthewJshow @ASavageNation She is a woman and diverse that is all that matters.
@Moonbeamelf @ASavageNation Wow I don't think he is going to be able to get over this one.
@Slippydip1 @WSJ @jasongay If my picture was of a black man what would you have said?
@jasongay Is that what you said to get your job writing for the wsj?
@JKHokie @bennyjohnson @KPkski @BoKnowsNews She always speaks truth to power then runs away or calls the police before the power can do anything back.
@bennyjohnson @BoKnowsNews It is a joke. A sick bad joke.
@RashidaTlaib Are you looking for an award or something?
@RashidaTlaib So what.
@CBSThisMorning @60Minutes @andersoncooper @AOC This is a joke.
@WSJ @jasongay I pay for a membership to this paper and this is the crap they publish.
@maxberger Why don't you go do something productive and complain about Kevin Hart hosting the Oscars?
@maxberger You sound like a Democrat. Now go get upset that someone calls somebody gay.
@Variety Genius move.
@_BuddhistPunk_ You going to tell me how fragile I am and smile in my face when you see me darling.
@_BuddhistPunk_ Oh sweetie you are so sweet. Sweet women like you really are my favorite.
@Olivianuzzi I can't wait until a teacher swears in front of your kids at school and you go to the superintendent and complain.
@ewarren Even your husband won't drink a beer with you.
@ewarren Iowa is kinda boring the most exciting thing to do is stand in line so this doesn't really mean that much.
@_BuddhistPunk_ Oh I am so fragile darling. Maybe we can share a cell together someday.
@ConanOBrien I reported you to the authorities.
@BuzzFeed You gotta laugh when the content of the tweet is offensive but the replies to the tweet that were offensive got labeled as offensive.
@BuzzFeed This is a very respectful thing to do. She is a role model to Democrats everywhere. When you go to the store you can listen to the parents of a son or daughter who listen to Cardi B tell you how rude you are.		White men take note of how your next girlfriend is supposed to talk.
@Junzie19 @Newsweek In addition you are jiggle jaggling up the wazooki.
@nypost Wow that water is really clear I wonder if the water is from Hawaii.
@snmij1 @sethmoulton I can't stand women like that.
@sethmoulton Great the country is saved Trump thinks he would be a good general and Seth Moulton and Lawrence O'Donnell think he would not.
@sethmoulton Trump's Opinion VS Seth Moulton and Lawrence O'Donell Opinion in a duel to see whose opinion is more of an opinion.
@Newsweek Don't say it on Twitter about somebody else because it is considered abuse and your account will get locked.
@Newsweek That wasn't language that is unsuitable for a member of Congress. Saying the f word is considered politically correct.
@AdamKrouse @Newsweek @realDonaldTrump What does it even matter? This is pointless.
@SpritusInvictus @Newsweek That is because your ADD meds ran out.
@SpritusInvictus @Newsweek I don't think what you say is true.
@RealJamesWoods She is supposed to represent the 14th District and she thinks she is in charge of the world.
@JTlovesDexter @winglover504 @Newsweek Seems like a unstable democratic trait.
@JTlovesDexter @winglover504 @Newsweek Nobody was talking to you. I was just wondering how someone walks around without a brain. What are you going to teach me how to think tweets are about me when really they are about someone else?
@AdamKrouse @Newsweek @realDonaldTrump Democrats are unstable.
@Junzie19 @Newsweek Is there any way you could just not call me a bot. It is just that people reported my account to twitter and I had to prove I was human. I am going to sue you for libel.
@Jyrkiboy_ @Influx_Waver @NickV29 @jasontoon @stephen_hinton @ryanstruyk He just compared ice cream to abortion.
@Influx_Waver @Jyrkiboy_ @NickV29 @jasontoon @stephen_hinton @ryanstruyk He is from Finland. He doesn't understand how the country works.
@SpritusInvictus @Newsweek Eliminate the electoral college? All because Hillary won the popular vote. You are dreaming.
@ellehitter @johnmccoin13 @TalbertSwan So because you read Prof Anderson and I didn't you know more about slavery than me? What about all of the other books and documentaries on the subject. Is it possible that I read or watched them?
@winglover504 @JTlovesDexter @Newsweek You can explain to me how that works sometime.
@JTlovesDexter @Newsweek No that isn't what I am talking about.
@Jyrkiboy_ @Influx_Waver @NickV29 @jasontoon @stephen_hinton @ryanstruyk How did males make laws about pregnancy before if they can't do it because they can't get pregnant?
@DailyMailUK Cue the Democrats and Pit Bulls not being a safety concern at all.
@blazeymc91 @DailyMailUK Nobody knows what is true motive was for clapping and which statement he was clapping for.
@blazeymc91 @DailyMailUK You are allowed to vote for a person you want in your country. I just think it is funny how papers employ these people that are obviously biased to try and persuade people to vote otherwise. Journalism is by nature supposed to be unbiased.
@Newsweek Cue the Democrats.
@KenWills15 @oliverdarcy It really is amusing that these people at the papers think that everyone is fooled by their propaganda.
@DailyMailUK Daily Mail attempts to use anti-Corbyn propaganda but fails.
@Jyrkiboy_ @NickV29 @jasontoon @stephen_hinton @ryanstruyk I think everyone in Finland should pay taxes to the US since you think you can tell us what to do.
@Jyrkiboy_ @NickV29 @jasontoon @stephen_hinton @ryanstruyk I am really glad you live in Finland.
@Jyrkiboy_ @NickV29 @jasontoon @stephen_hinton @ryanstruyk That is an opinion.
@Jyrkiboy_ @NickV29 @jasontoon @stephen_hinton @ryanstruyk You don't even live in the US. You by law don't even get to tell us how to write the law. That is reality.
@Jyrkiboy_ @NickV29 @jasontoon @stephen_hinton @ryanstruyk You don't make reality.
@Jyrkiboy_ @NickV29 @jasontoon @stephen_hinton @ryanstruyk I think you should be able to make laws about pregnancy even if you can't get pregnant.
@HuffPost How come she didn't have anything to say when asked on pay? I think the GOP should just leave the room quick when she talks.
@DailyMirror She could make our congress more diverse. We should bring her into the country and vote for her to represent the state of Vermont.
@DailyMirror Which party do you think she would be in if she lived in America?
@TheKitchenista Name a rapper that doesn't rap about committing crimes.
@Newsweek Democrats have to be one of the most unstable groups I have ever seen. They pass laws for the moment just so they can get their way and have no intention of keeping the laws in place once they get their way. They make a mockery of government.
@alanocu @CNN @JonDeSade It is all about qualification not making sure that every person that wants to do a job can without filling the requirements.
@Newsweek Latest tweet attempting to claim another tweet backfired backfires in one person's opinion.
@NewDay @AttorneyCrump This makes national news because ....
@pennybeagle17 @CNN You seem to have a lot of opinions on what another company should do. Maybe you can start your own airline company and I can tell you what to do with it.
@CNN I don't understand why liberals and liberal news stations have such a hard time understanding that there are work requirements to a job.
@marklevinshow I don't understand how she can have pictures making peace signs if she wants to fight.
@Jyrkiboy_ @NickV29 @jasontoon @stephen_hinton @ryanstruyk Do you think people shouldn't be able to make laws because they can't get pregnant? Why are you talking about abortions you can't get pregnant?
@ASavageNation Hope they catch him.
@ASavageNation Hey sorry to hear about that.
@astrofelt @andizeisler @meakoopa Are you going to be ok? I feel bad that you are so hurt that someone with the freedom of speech asked a question about someone.
@andizeisler Does it offend you that someone decides to critique a member of Congress?
@SaysHummingbird @IlhanMN Fleeing war isn't really an accomplishment.
@TheSun There was no news story about it.
@TheSun This happened to me when I was a kid.
@CBSNews Everybody wants to have everything but they want everything to have no flaws.
@DailyMailCeleb Not sure why the focus is on looks.
@Jyrkiboy_ @NickV29 @jasontoon @stephen_hinton @ryanstruyk Those factors have nothing to do with becoming a Senator or Representative. Men do get harassed on a daily basis. I am not sure what the differences have to do with making laws.
@daveweigel @RashidaTlaib Other than the don't like him. Which isn't a crime.
@daveweigel @RashidaTlaib What crime are they going to impeach him for?
@ISendYouLove @ryanstruyk Republicans are stuck in the past but Democrats believe that reparations should be paid to people the were legally enslaved before 1865.
@teeNYMD50 @ryanstruyk Why again is having more females in Congress moving the country forward?
@bruyere560 @stephen_hinton @ryanstruyk Why does being a b word make you qualified for government?
@Jyrkiboy_ @NickV29 @jasontoon @stephen_hinton @ryanstruyk Men and women are equal under the law. Your tweet is an opinion and/or a political ideology that all people don't have to agree with.
@AshChawla2012 @ryanstruyk Wouldn't that end the checks and balances?
@wooopop @shaunking Not true. Completely false.
@CallingShoRai @Newsweek Are we supposed to say nothing?
@nypost All the people that participate in this game should be allowed to vote just ask @KamalaHarris.
@GatorPats @Newsweek Try Carrie Nation on for size.		https://t.co/jiI3FD4wGE
@JanuaryHandl @Newsweek Again two different people in two different circumstances.
@CathyTiedemann @Newsweek That is a question reserved for your gender studies class.
@Newsweek Fox news is its own independent news organization and they can do what they want. What is the story here?
@KamalaHarris People that vote should be informed and educated.
@Egypt_Exodus @michaeldickson @rogerwaters Like the music hate the politics.
@nypost This is not impressive.
@HammerMartel77 @4DthaOG @stephenmatlock @TalbertSwan @Linda86182650 Don't want to explain it. I am done.
@ThunkingMan @barleyscotch @TalbertSwan You can think I am racist again but if you keep calling me it I am going to sue you.
@wooopop @shaunking If you have a hard time understanding it you are part of the problem. You didn't answer my question and I am more important so I don't have time for you.
@creolepepper @TalbertSwan LOL! I go. You need to go and listen more.
@HammerMartel77 @4DthaOG @stephenmatlock @TalbertSwan @Linda86182650 If you don't understand I am not going to explain it to you? Read some more. Don't have time for you.
@ThunkingMan @barleyscotch @TalbertSwan Every individual has the right to pursue his/her own interest.
@wooopop @shaunking Do you support people like 2Pac, Jay-Z, and others who say snitching is wrong?
@barleyscotch @ThunkingMan @TalbertSwan Everyone is equal under the law. I care not for emotion.
@ThunkingMan @barleyscotch @TalbertSwan Sorry I am a white man and my account got suspended. Somebody called the Twitter police on me. Does that fit your narrative?
@ThunkingMan @barleyscotch @TalbertSwan You are not allowed to say that or repeat me because it is abuse.
@ThunkingMan @barleyscotch @TalbertSwan Seems like you were triggered by what I said.
@shaunking Jay-Z:	All these (n) out here snitchin	We was one step away from takin this crack money	And recyclin it through the ghettoes	And buildin back up our own hoods	Now all you (n) start snitchin on each other	I got partners doin' 15-20	Wouldn'ta been doin' (s)	If you didn't snitch	(b)
@shaunking Jay-Z:		Uh-huh, yeah, it was all good just a week ago	And the jewelry..	And then my (f word) (n word) started snitchin	Uh-huh, uh uh, yo	(b word)
@shaunking Jay-Z;		Now you know that's bad when your sister is mad	And your son gotta grow up like, "This is my dad?"	The labelling of a snitch is a lifetime scar	You'll always be in jail (n word), just minus the bars
@ThunkingMan @barleyscotch @TalbertSwan You feel too much.
@shaunking 2Pac:		I can't stand fake (a word) (b word)	Lyin' (a word) (n word) and you punk (a word) SNITCHES	I can't stand fake (a word) (b word)	Lyin' (a word) (n word) and you punk (a word) SNITCHES
@shaunking 2Pac:	Stay that stay strapped 'cause my raps is tight	You (f word)' punks, I hate you snitches	Went against the grain and the game to be fake (a word) (b word)
@shaunking https://t.co/RWl0zjcaSp
@shaunking https://t.co/2UcP2iIKUh
@shaunking Who invented the stop snitching culture?
@ellehitter @johnmccoin13 @TalbertSwan You now have resorted to expressing emotion instead of fact.
@76MarciaStone @TalbertSwan Excuse me but what you just said to me is offensive and abusive.
@Newsweek I am not sure what the gender or religion of the person elected has to do with their ability to do the job. How come they are not focusing on her foreign policy?
@ellehitter @johnmccoin13 @TalbertSwan You are describing yourself.
@IlhanMN @AOC https://t.co/OWhlceMoLs
@IlhanMN @AOC Black Power movement was prominent in the late 1960s and early 1970s, emphasizing racial pride and the creation of black political and cultural institutions to nurture and promote black collective interests and advance black values.		White, Asian, and Hispanic are not included.
@IlhanMN @AOC It is used primarily, but not exclusively, by African Americans in the United States.
@IlhanMN @AOC Black Power is a political slogan and a name for various associated ideologies aimed at achieving self-determination for people of African descent.[1] 		Again she has whit people in her district and this symbol gives question to her ability to represent them without racial bias.
@IlhanMN @AOC Isn't the fist she is making in her tweet a racist symbol of black power?
@trevorh321 @Linda86182650 @stephenmatlock @TalbertSwan If we all go to Mars do you think we still would be the problem?
@DailyMail Yeah but this is attempted murder.
@ellehitter @johnmccoin13 @TalbertSwan 3. Your lack of knowledge, but more, your resistance to gaining knowledge renders your opinions invalid and you, irrelevant. (Again you determine that I have a lack of knowledge which implies you know more.)		4.Stop with this ignorance. Educate yourself.  (Implies you know more.)
@ellehitter @johnmccoin13 @TalbertSwan Key word is you. Your opinion. You are a very self-centered person to think that YOUR opinion means more than someone else.
@ellehitter @johnmccoin13 @TalbertSwan You continually take a stance of superiority of knowledge to me. In every tweet you are talking down to me.		https://t.co/LbpdbmbEoV have shown a lack of education on this subject. (Implies you know more.)		2. Then be responsible and educate yourself. (Implies that you know more)
@ellehitter @johnmccoin13 @TalbertSwan Suggesting another to read a book you feel accurately represents a given topic is also an opinion. My opinion could differ on the portrayal of events in the book.  Another book could yet differ.
@trevorh321 @Linda86182650 @stephenmatlock @TalbertSwan Who are you talking to and what point are you talking about?
@ellehitter @johnmccoin13 @TalbertSwan A fact is in 1865 Slavery was abolished.		An opinion is slavery is the worst thing to happen in the history of the world.
@ellehitter @johnmccoin13 @TalbertSwan Definition of knowledge: facts, information, and skills acquired by a person through experience or education; the theoretical or practical understanding of a subject.
@ellehitter @johnmccoin13 @TalbertSwan I find it offensive that you are calling me ignorant. Opinions are not considered knowledge. Only facts are considered knowledge.
@ellehitter @johnmccoin13 @TalbertSwan You don't know my intention, mental state or my motives when I make the tweets I make.
@DailyMail Bus driver didn't do anything to stop. I am interested to know the political affiliation of the parents whose kid did this to another kid. I understand that kids don't think like adults but this is unacceptable.
@ellehitter @johnmccoin13 @TalbertSwan Excuse me. Calling me ignorant is disrespectful and offensive. You don't know what I know about the subject.
@ellehitter @johnmccoin13 @TalbertSwan To suggest I am not educated is an insult.
@ellehitter @johnmccoin13 @TalbertSwan Why do I have to read the opinion of someone else when I myself can see?
@TalbertSwan Mr Swan should focus on listening to me.		He should also focus on cleaning up any graffiti, trash, and other debris in his neighborhood.		He should also focus on gun violence among his neighbors.		He needs to stop being sensitive and fragile about things.
@TalbertSwan Mr. Swan should focus on just making his community better.		Mr. Swan should also focus on not focusing on race so much.		Mr. Swan should also focus on not using such vile language in his tweets.		These are just a few things Mr. Swan should focus on.
@kaitlancollins I would say that this is a fact stated plain as day.
@AbrahmLPhD @policy_ofTruth @TalbertSwan Nothing you say makes any sense.
@policy_ofTruth @AbrahmLPhD @TalbertSwan I don't know why you can't understand that you can't convince another to live according to what you are convinced of if they are convinced of something else.
@policy_ofTruth @AbrahmLPhD @TalbertSwan Excuse me. When did you become the person in charge  of my mouth and my destiny. I don't even know what you are referring too as when I do the same thing Swan does my account is flagged for abuse.
@ThunkingMan @barleyscotch @TalbertSwan I don't even know what you are talking about. My side of the argument is considered abuse by Twitter. I said the same things Swan and his followers said and I got locked out of my account.
@HammerMartel77 @4DthaOG @stephenmatlock @TalbertSwan @Linda86182650 That argument has fallen on deaf ears since it started. These people are essentially a cult. The only truth is the truth of their leader.
@ellehitter @johnmccoin13 @TalbertSwan I am responsible for what I do. I am not guilty or responsible for another man or woman's crime.
@ellehitter @johnmccoin13 @TalbertSwan Slavery in the US was abolished by law in 1865. I have no control over what the laws were before I was born.
@one_punch_tom @larrynotmyname @SecularSpicoli @TalbertSwan @johnmccoin13 Swan on the other hand talks about white this and that everyday.
@AbrahmLPhD @TalbertSwan Have you ever been convicted of a crime?
@one_punch_tom @larrynotmyname @SecularSpicoli @TalbertSwan @johnmccoin13 I was saying everything Swan said. So by your logic of calling me a racist Swan is also a racist. I was doing all of this to prove a point and you just proved it. None of this is what I normally think about on a day to day basis.
@ABTweet5 @stephenmatlock @NorthBelle4 @StradlingDianne @Linda86182650 @TalbertSwan It is amusing. He cries everyday about white people.
@ABTweet5 @stephenmatlock @NorthBelle4 @StradlingDianne @Linda86182650 @TalbertSwan Again said to me. What are you offended that I said it to you now? Am I in the wrong? Do I play by a different set of rules?
@one_punch_tom @larrynotmyname @SecularSpicoli @TalbertSwan @johnmccoin13 You don't know me.
@ABTweet5 @stephenmatlock @NorthBelle4 @StradlingDianne @Linda86182650 @TalbertSwan Is it an attack when swan says it?
@ABTweet5 @stephenmatlock @NorthBelle4 @StradlingDianne @Linda86182650 @TalbertSwan I repeated swan.
@ABTweet5 @stephenmatlock @NorthBelle4 @StradlingDianne @Linda86182650 @TalbertSwan Swan said that.
@ABTweet5 @stephenmatlock @NorthBelle4 @StradlingDianne @Linda86182650 @TalbertSwan Yeah I said that. Did you see the angry mob attack me.
@AbrahmLPhD @TalbertSwan Are you doing anything illegal right now?
@12thHousePluto @johnmccoin13 @TalbertSwan What are you talking about?
@ladydiane2017 What a guy at McDonald's ain't allowed to protest while on the job for something he thinks is wrong?
@one_punch_tom @larrynotmyname @SecularSpicoli @TalbertSwan @johnmccoin13 Stop explaining things to me.
@SpicoliTaknCuba @Linda86182650 @TalbertSwan He says white women putting them all in one group.
@SpicoliTaknCuba @Linda86182650 @TalbertSwan Have black women cops killed black people? Why is white mentioned?
@larrynotmyname @one_punch_tom @SecularSpicoli @TalbertSwan @johnmccoin13 I could care less if you are respectful. Say them.
@AbrahmLPhD @TalbertSwan Hey do you have any weed?
@SpicoliTaknCuba @Linda86182650 @TalbertSwan Tell white women cops to stop killing black people. -Swan
@SpicoliTaknCuba @Linda86182650 @TalbertSwan If I would call you all of the things he has called other people you would say I was a hate filled racist.
@SpicoliTaknCuba @Linda86182650 @TalbertSwan I disagree with him. Some things are accurate but not in the way he presents it.
@TalbertSwan @larrynotmyname @johnmccoin13 I am just repeating the same things you say only about black people if it isn't hate for you it isn't hate for me you fake Martin Luther King wannabe.
@TalbertSwan @larrynotmyname @johnmccoin13 https://t.co/6OVy1KMeUK
@4DthaOG Every post of Swan's is crying about something.
@AlexMAbroad @TalbertSwan Every one of his tweets say or addresses the white community. Can't you read or something?
@stephenmatlock @Linda86182650 @TalbertSwan What are you trying to say to me? I am not wrong either I hope somebody kneels and refuses to serve a cheeseburger.
@WSJ Hey that is what Philadelphia looks like. I am talking about the garbage all over the ground.
@johnmccoin13 @TalbertSwan Yep he has a bunch of hate fueled followers.
@nypost Big win for free speech. People need to be able to display stuff like this.
@dandrezner I have an even better idea. We should guilt trip men into believing they are scumbags for not voting for a woman for president.
@DailyMirror How could that officer just hit that woman like that I am appalled?
@people The only potential in dating Nick Cannon is that you might be able to divorce him and get half of his money.
@dandrezner Screw her foreign policy ideas she had a beer.
@DailyMirror Sounds like the guy who took the video is jealous that it wasn't him.
@DailyMirror That doesn't look like sex to me she slipped and he is helping her up.
@MarkDice @AnnCoulter He is also friendly with the gay community.
@JohnCleese The detective is still looking for the two men who stole my cell phone and knocked me out. She doesn't have enough time to look. It has been over a month and a half.
@UmarZBhatti97 @MuslimIQ Am I free to do whatever I want?
@maddow Wow it really is amazing the Rachel Maddow grants pardons to all of the black and hispanic drug traffickers by only pointing out the white ones.
@trekbek @MuslimIQ @bfrankphoto @ReSightIslam Here I will even supply you with some more science....		https://t.co/4QjOnJlK3l	https://t.co/6s8sulRgx5
@TofeeqMajeed1 @MuslimIQ There is a lot you know about this subject which means you spend a great amount of time learning about it.
@trekbek @MuslimIQ @bfrankphoto @ReSightIslam You just seem confused by everything. That science article should really help you understand.
@trekbek @MuslimIQ @bfrankphoto @ReSightIslam Here read about science.		https://t.co/RuOYLH6Rrk
@trekbek @MuslimIQ @bfrankphoto @ReSightIslam Was that a little demon that just ran by.
@trekbek @MuslimIQ @bfrankphoto @ReSightIslam I would hate to leave you at a point where you couldn't understand the main message because I didn't spend an hour proofreading my tweet and perfecting it. For some reason it gets hotter when I talk to you.
@trekbek @MuslimIQ @bfrankphoto @ReSightIslam Some people need to be talked to with every piece of grammar in the right spot. Now that I know you are one of them I will have to watch my words more carefully. It really is like being in hell talking to you by the way.
@trekbek @MuslimIQ @bfrankphoto @ReSightIslam I thought you were smarter than me since you know what the dhimmi is and I did not. Now it is proven that you don't even know what a figure of speech is as you failed to recognize it.
@TofeeqMajeed1 @MuslimIQ So you say Christ did not die on the cross?
@linmp1031 @STiG911 @MuslimIQ Ok but what is your answer anyway.
@TofeeqMajeed1 @MuslimIQ So you are saying that death is or could be symbolic of not knowing and since Christ and Mohamed taught they rose them. What about Lazarus?
@linmp1031 @STiG911 @MuslimIQ That depends if I call you a name you don't like or break a law that in turns makes you a victim, do you call me?
@TofeeqMajeed1 @MuslimIQ If one church injects lies into religion what is to stop another one.
@TofeeqMajeed1 @MuslimIQ I know.
@TofeeqMajeed1 @MuslimIQ It is written that Christ healed the blind, rose the dead, turned water to wine, and various other miracles. Mohamed could not even cure his own ailment as he died of fever. How is a man that can't cure a fever greater than Christ?
@TofeeqMajeed1 @MuslimIQ How can you say the last is the most important when God is both the Alpha and the Omega?
@TofeeqMajeed1 @MuslimIQ Christ had no sword. There was no inquisition performed by Christ.
@TofeeqMajeed1 @MuslimIQ In other words Christ is an individual who had a message. His pure message consists of his actions and his words. Through Christ all are saved. When others take Christ's words and use them for their purpose they are no longer Christ's words but the words of another.
@TofeeqMajeed1 @MuslimIQ There is no rug that remains clean while others walk on it.
@TofeeqMajeed1 @MuslimIQ In other words you answered your own question.
@TofeeqMajeed1 @MuslimIQ Muhammed came after Christ. You tell me.
@trekbek @MuslimIQ @bfrankphoto @ReSightIslam Do you need figures of speech explained to you? Lucky for you @MuslimIQ is a nice guy and you can ask him because I am not.
@trekbek @MuslimIQ @bfrankphoto @ReSightIslam I am sitting here wondering why your concern means so much. Do you think you are some sort of icon or something?
@trekbek @MuslimIQ @bfrankphoto @ReSightIslam You poor fragile thing, are you like okay?
@trekbek @MuslimIQ @bfrankphoto @ReSightIslam Did you say anything to me?
@trekbek @MuslimIQ @bfrankphoto @ReSightIslam I don't feel like being in hell right now.
@trekbek @MuslimIQ @bfrankphoto @ReSightIslam Lies and deceit you know no other way. Promise a kingdom or promise to be like God. Your words have no meaning.
@trekbek @MuslimIQ @bfrankphoto @ReSightIslam What are you masquerading as? It seems to be the Devil.
@trekbek @MuslimIQ @bfrankphoto @ReSightIslam I believe that you said too much.
@trekbek @MuslimIQ @bfrankphoto @ReSightIslam Seems the best way for you to talk to someone you don't know is to insult them. Did you listen to what he said? Are you Muslim?
@trekbek @MuslimIQ @bfrankphoto @ReSightIslam I heard I responded without listening. I am a conservative and I only exist because I don't listen.
@trekbek @MuslimIQ @bfrankphoto @ReSightIslam What was I supposed to hear in what you just said?
@Dsp503 @MuslimIQ @ReSightIslam Of course I love to learn.
@bfrankphoto @MuslimIQ @ReSightIslam I don't doubt that he is a good guy. Do you think there are actually bad guys full of mis-information?
@trekbek @MuslimIQ @bfrankphoto @ReSightIslam If I wouldn't listen how did I give a response?
@bfrankphoto @MuslimIQ @ReSightIslam Sir, actually I was not expecting him to give any type of answer. I was more excited than anything to see the answer he would give.
@UmarZBhatti97 @MuslimIQ Ok I am not required to be Muslim.
@MuslimIQ @ReSightIslam I will have to listen.
@dmohamed14 @MuslimIQ How does a non-Muslim live in a majority Muslim country?
@MuslimIQ I am not Muslim and never want to be Muslim. What is your view of me?
@DailyMail A plane could have crashed this is unacceptable.
@TalbertSwan @myclearwaterPD Yeah Bishop that should be hate crime for the sole reason he is white.
@TalbertSwan Bishop you say the laws are biased against blacks and cops are racist. Why would they arrest him? Why didn't they arrest her?
@TalbertSwan Why would the racist cops arrest him?
@TalbertSwan She used excessive force. That force is not granted to cashiers.
@CBSNews I told the auditor to just trust me and he asked for documentation.
@CBSNews I went into the room behind the curtain and said some things. I know you can't hear the things I said but trust me I said good things.
@infinitemagnus1 @ChuckCallesto I got convicted on figurative language of an artistic liberal.
@infinitemagnus1 @ChuckCallesto See the laws.
@infinitemagnus1 @ChuckCallesto Laws don't work on figurative language. Figurative language is for book writers and artists not Representatives and Senators.
@christi82854139 @ZanderKelly30 @DailyCaller Nobody wants to pay you to watch over nature.
@ChuckCallesto A  military attack has nothing in common with the temperature warming.
@ZanderKelly30 @DailyCaller Tesla to this day has not made a single dollar in profit and yet banks continue to loan the company money. Tesla has lost close to $5 billion since it first started as a company.
@nytimes If you need to know what to do if your boyfriend barfs into your bag she is also the person to go to. Apparently she wrote "My Boyfriend Barfed in My Handbag...and Other Things You Can't Ask Martha" this of course was labeled a New York Times bestseller.
@nytimes I need to learn how to hold healthy grudges by Jolie Kerr. Some woman that was hired by the New York TImes. I didn't know how to do it until today.
@ZanderKelly30 @DailyCaller Nature needs to be maintained because it doesn't maintain itself.
@pacificsilver @CBSNews @realDonaldTrump All the dumb things liberals have said over the years.
@pacificsilver @CBSNews @realDonaldTrump Honestly I just get tired with arguing with liberals on here and resort to comedy.
@pacificsilver @CBSNews @realDonaldTrump I agree. Who cares if she drinks a beer? It has nothing to do with policy.
@pacificsilver @CBSNews @realDonaldTrump I don't even know.
@pacificsilver @CBSNews @realDonaldTrump You think that have a beer thing is honest.
@pacificsilver @CBSNews @realDonaldTrump Yeah pretty much everything is BS anymore.
@pacificsilver @CBSNews @realDonaldTrump Why don't you elect another guy to preside over another bailout or not have sexual relations in the oval office?
@pacificsilver @CBSNews @realDonaldTrump Yeah Democrats are more moral than everyone.
@ImsoJinxy @CBSNews You have to be able to get voted in felons, kids, psychopaths, etc. Whatever it takes to get a Democrat elected.
@ImsoJinxy @CBSNews Actually I think the Democrats want to allow kids to vote. In addition kids can watch news and they also do sometimes buy and drink beer.
@Crackpotkin Yep this guy can say whatever he wants but I have to follow your advice. Nope, not happening.
@mayordanimal @CBSNews You must have had a beer (or two).
@pacificsilver @CBSNews @realDonaldTrump Chill out and have a beer.
@JuggaloJust @CBSNews Just have a beer and they will go away.
@CBSNews This is setting a terrible example for the kids.
@nypost Welcome to America where everything is for sale. Morals and loyalties do I hear a $1,000.
@DailyCaller They do it for the people.
@MuslimIQ If it isn't a black and white issue you don't seem to know the answer to it.
@TalbertSwan @Walmart @DillonsGrocery @McDonalds The world only consists of these four things.
@DailyMailUK I have a secret battle with being able to afford the cost of living. Feel bad for me.
@NYDailyNews She did it all without the help of a man.
@BET This picture showcases what it means to be talented. Take notes.
@CNNPolitics That is sorta like eating a pickle but the pickle is still on your plate.
@DryGulchMerch @DonaldJTrumpJr She fooled me. I can be such a fool compared to the elite.
@BuzzFeed This has to be one of the most important questions of the 21st century.
@Fribbler123 @HuffPost If I were a woman I would marry him. I like big cheeks.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Must be looking for a new job with a paper that is biased towards Trump.
@MeechonMeech @HuffPost Without a doubt. She has no ties to mermaids in her ancestral tree.
@IsThisOnOrWhat @HuffPost This is a historical first. It makes going to the moon look like sawdust.
@_ChristineConst @HuffPost Are you mansplaining to me?
@HuffPost I thought Ariel was a sexist cartoon character drawn by the white man. It is lunacy to think that a woman needs the help from a prince or any man for that matter.
@NewDay Good thing she is not considered privileged. She will earn her way. Being the daughter of one of the richest members of congress won't help her at all. Everyone just be quiet there is only white male privilege. If you disagree you have mental health problems.
@NewDay Wow that sounds violent. Do Democrats support that sort of thing or something? My question is how many people has she actually done this to that we don't know about?
@AlliemalCNN Don't you believe in multitasking or something?
@nieman_james @VoteblueI @TalbertSwan I know. It is good to have thick skin.
@nypost There is no excuse for this type of aggressiveness. They need a female coach to feminize their play.
@J1mmyPockets @MailOnline No comment as they will put me in a cell with my own poop.
@Rafaela_g9 @MailOnline You were labeled offensive by the Twitter gods.
@J1mmyPockets @MailOnline Your tweet was labeled offensive because you are not a protected species. Next they will put you in a cell with your own poop.
@MailOnline According to the mall "The seal should have held the poop until the show was over."
@MailOnline This is how Confucius told them to treat one another, the Buddha is smiling in Nirvana, and at least they still use chop sticks.
@DailyCaller Where did my crab legs go?
@ewarren So you admit that you are fighting.
@nieman_james @VoteblueI @TalbertSwan It is ok buddy I got the point.
@nieman_james @VoteblueI @TalbertSwan Yep that pretty much sums it up.
@MarkSalter55 @realDonaldTrump Is truth really that important when you are trying to tell a lie.
@DailyCaller Pension Advisor
@Independent After a lifetime of shaking their ass and singing about shooting cops and dealing drugs they decide to preach morals to the masses. This is a good career move.
@Independent This is really a good career move. Kids take note of this great role model.
@thor_benson @MollyJongFast @TheRickWilson @mehdirhasan @shaunking @jules_su @JordanUhl @kenklippenstein @mtaibbi @brockwilbur @yashar @JoshuaHol What no Jesus?
@VoteblueI @TalbertSwan I probably should also start doing drugs.
@Independent He made the single mistake of doing it with his shoes untied.
@VoteblueI @TalbertSwan I forgot I will dye my hair pink.
@VoteblueI @TalbertSwan I think I will go pierce my tongue and nose, get a tattoo on my face, and become a woman so I can be considered a normal person.
@VoteblueI @TalbertSwan Are you reaching out to me for help? Do you want me to call for you? I am surprised because women don't need men.
@VoteblueI @TalbertSwan You can check yourself in at any time.
@VoteblueI @TalbertSwan I did not now nor will I ever inhale.
@DailyMailCeleb I don't want my children seeing her butt.
@DailyMailCeleb Again this is objectification the feminists don't want this. Why won't you just submit? Do we need to send you to sensitivity training? There is more to her than just a butt.
@VoteblueI @TalbertSwan Oh look a Freudian slip she is mad.
@VoteblueI @TalbertSwan I am going to resist the laws until someone hurts me and then I am going to demand the laws are followed.
@VoteblueI @TalbertSwan You are a Twitter Terrorist.
@VoteblueI @TalbertSwan See what I mean they get blocked they start a new account and accuse you of having problems. You shouldn't even be here. You were blocked.
@VoteblueI @TalbertSwan I would mansplain but it is not allowed.
@guardian This proves that religion is fake.
@Melissa_meep @spicehavanagirl @guardian Go use your powers to generalize and surmise on someone else.
@Melissa_meep @spicehavanagirl @guardian Clearly it is a police state and nosy neighbors. Have a nice day comrade.
@DailyMail Well this proves that after you complete years of school you can still be a complete (insert choice word not appropriate for the children).
@DailyMailCeleb That man is so brave he finally showed that a man can be equal to a woman.
@DailyMailCeleb Both have achieved the same.
@DailyMailUK Hmm. No hate crime charges.
@nypost Another example of a police officer doing the opposite of what he is supposed to do.
@realDonaldTrump He is looking for a pension fund to raid. US has the biggest pension fund.
@JohnCleese Comedy Legend
@DailyMailUK Does this tweet make my butt look big?
@Independent It used to be an accomplishment to invent the cure for polio. Now it is an accomplishment to dump your boyfriend.
@WayneDupreeShow You know that someone could really be offended by what you say and they will demand that a law abiding citizen has his rights taken away.
@wushulove @DailyMail I guess the moms who know everything were busy posting selfies of their behind.
@DailyMail Why didn't the moms invent the cure?
@TheSun OMG! How can they objectify her like that? When you see a picture of a woman you should try to focus on her personality.
@BuzzFeed When will men finally she her as Alexander's equal?
@VoteblueI @TalbertSwan Twitter needs to start protecting the people who didn't get their account blocked from the people who did.
@BuzzFeed She is so brave this reminds me of the time Alexander the Great crossed the Alps.
@VoteblueI @TalbertSwan Once a person who gets their account blocked always a person who gets their account blocked. You shouldn't be here around the children. You will teach them the things not to say.
@VoteblueI @TalbertSwan Stop thinking.
@VoteblueI @TalbertSwan You think I am uncomfortable. You think too much.
@VoteblueI @TalbertSwan Besides he said the w word. We are not from the same ethnicity we like to be called Irish, German, British, Polish, or Russian. The w word is such a generalization because it groups us all together as if we do the same things.
@VoteblueI @TalbertSwan My point is when a white person does what he does he is ordered to stop declared a racist and made an outcast. The same should happen to him.
@Melissa_meep @spicehavanagirl @guardian Mr. Surmiser strikes again. You know what Miss Generalization says one you threaten a spider you always threaten a spider.
@Independent I don't like the word shreds here. It makes her sound too much like a tool in an office.
@amandawgolden I find what Mitt said to be divisive.
@emzanotti I thought Democrats were against the tactic known as profiling.
@emzanotti Did you just profile her?
@AndrewScheer I never heard a politician make a claim like that and not follow through in my entire life.
@mclaughe @MyobaMazon @TalbertSwan They are real things because now when you google them you will find them.
@mclaughe @MyobaMazon @TalbertSwan Are you accusing someone of word appropriation and mouth burglary?
@lanamize1 @edjlord3000 @jennyyangtv @oliviamunn You must be the future crimes police.
@spicehavanagirl @guardian One again it was a police state and nosy neighbors thank you much for being a good comrade.
@guardian LOL! Police state with a bunch of neighbors that don't know how to mind their own business.
@gabethethiccboi @VoteblueI @TalbertSwan I don't really think segregation is the answer.
@LEBassett Seems like something you brought upon yourself. Many people live a life of quiet solitude.
@gabethethiccboi @VoteblueI @TalbertSwan LOL. Who are you and how do you even know that?
@gabethethiccboi @VoteblueI @TalbertSwan What? You tell me to stand down let them do their thing. Isn't that not letting me do my thing.
@Rosahil78311581 How about you say that the black terrorists that spit on me, threatened me and threw things at me get caught?
@Rosahil78311581 How about you say that you hope that the group of black terrorists that hit me over the head and left me for dead get caught?
@VoteblueI @TalbertSwan Every one of his posts is about white people.
@VoteblueI @TalbertSwan He routinely preaches against the white man. He uses extreme language and hatred.
@Rosahil78311581 That bishop routinely preaches hate against white people and the white community. Every one of his tweets is directed towards the white community.
@lanamize1 @TheAtlantic You have a history of the same thing.
@lanamize1 @edjlord3000 @jennyyangtv @oliviamunn Your first statement is actually a generalization. Do you absolute and clear evidence that the statement is true?
@lanamize1 @edjlord3000 @jennyyangtv @oliviamunn This is your opinion. Your opinion is not the law. I don't think you should be allowed to tweet.
@Rosahil78311581 Excuse me. Who do you think you are to tell me what to do? Democrats have all ready said they think wishes and prayers are nonsense. In my past posts I have said that I hope the man is caught.
@SenSanders What exactly are you waiting for? How many times are you going to say it and not do it?
@RageQuitJah @DailyMail Good point. Why wasn't he living with his family?
@ChuckCallesto Wow! That doesn't say much for the rule of law and free and fair elections.
@learningtohate Are you trying to hold a court of law over twitter or something? People take pictures with other people all the time. It is like saying to people you know that you are best friends with a celebrity after you have photo evidence of it.
@CarolLeonnig @Lawrence I am sure he has an explanation or a legal defense for the picture.
@DailyMail Yeah they definitely have the guy on video. If anything they should have just called the police and gave them the video. The store could have just posted pictures of the man and informed him that he was no longer allowed to enter until he paid off the item.
@realDonaldTrump It would definitely save people money that depend on gas to get around. People that look to profit off of the sale of gas may be disappointed. Maybe it would be even better if we didn't depend on gas at all.
@JonellCrandell @DineshDSouza If everyone around you is doing the wrong thing and you are not you better find some new company otherwise you will be the only one left for people to do wrong.
@outforbeer @DineshDSouza Only when you do it in China and the US hears about it.
@72ps @DineshDSouza Stealing from one country so that the country who steals has more for their children is hardly moral.
@Afc07 @DineshDSouza That is one viewpoint on it. The viewpoint has a very dim outlook of people and what they are capable of doing. Sounds like the person who wrote it doesn't understand the meaning of disturbing a hornets nest.
@RareCamellia @DineshDSouza @AP4Liberty and examined by multiple parties with differing viewpoints.
@DineshDSouza Who is the country determined to be bad by?
@KamalaHarris I agree with you on this one. I had to get stitches and glue when someone elbowed me in the face playing basketball. They charged us $500 for the stitches and glue. It is definitely profiting off of misfortune. To me it is price gouging.
@jfmarlin @Mike_Saltsman Go surmise yourself.
@jfmarlin @Mike_Saltsman I am going to watch more educational programs and read more news.
@jfmarlin @Mike_Saltsman Yeah that is great. Let's just call each other names and beat on our chests.
@nypost Prison is where he should call home when convicted.
@MeritLaw That also means they are not equally applied to me.
@jfmarlin @Mike_Saltsman None of those things are a necessity to life. One can live in a hut with no electric. Nothing is owed to any business.
@ToddWS76 @Williamscanlon6 @DailyCaller He was going to make a tackle if he was defenseless it was because he was not defending himself.
@DailyCaller Looked legal to me.
@jfmarlin @Mike_Saltsman A poor man cannot afford a Lamborghini but somehow his life goes on without the product. The manufacturing of the product may even make the poor man's life worse.
@jfmarlin @Mike_Saltsman You going to provide 200 jobs to a country of 300 million and pretend to be a savior.
@jfmarlin @Mike_Saltsman Laughing is noise mostly reserved for fools.
@jfmarlin @Mike_Saltsman What is your product a plastic bottle, cigarettes, OxyContin, some faulty medical device?
@TheSun I am curious to know who the motorist is, why they have a license, was there any evidence of erratic driving before the incident, and who issued and allowed them to keep the license.
@MyobaMazon @TalbertSwan From what the article says is sounds like a murder and could even be first degree. We do not know why at this point the man shot the gun and who was his intended target. Nor do we know if it was race based.
@MyobaMazon @TalbertSwan The American Legal system works a certain way. You can not just accuse someone of being a terrorist and expect the courts to rule that they are. You must prove that their act was an act of terrorism. If you don't prove that they get off.
@MyobaMazon @TalbertSwan You don't even know the motives of the person who committed the crime? Nobody even knows the person who committed the crime. How can you determine why he killed the person? You throw around words so carelessly.
@rose_ebue @momadonanohio @ScottPresler @ChelseaClinton I didn't know.
@jfmarlin @Mike_Saltsman Your product is not needed.
@MeritLaw ***In your opinion.
@TruthspeakerHQ @stopbeingfamous Like sell heroin?
@TruthspeakerHQ @stopbeingfamous Puerto Rico is a territory of the US. Puerto Ricans are considered American that drink is considered American.
@TruthspeakerHQ @stopbeingfamous Yep
@TruthspeakerHQ @stopbeingfamous That term is not really accepted by law. There are no laws about cultural appropriation. It is an opinion of some people who did not garner enough support to get laws passed because the claim is ludicrous.
@TruthspeakerHQ @stopbeingfamous Those words are a part of American culture.
@TruthspeakerHQ @stopbeingfamous How exactly is the culture being stolen? Those people are American. There are just other Americans using and categorizing the words.
@Ajd8899 @AntiFeministXX @WayneDupreeShow You said it. It must be true.
@TruthspeakerHQ @stopbeingfamous Is there something preventing a person of color from making their own website to categorize words?
@TruthspeakerHQ @stopbeingfamous There is nothing to understand. The point is invalid.
@Ajd8899 @AntiFeministXX @WayneDupreeShow You are the one who is discriminating based on gender.
@Ajd8899 @AntiFeministXX @WayneDupreeShow They should stop separating based on gender that is discriminatory.
@Ajd8899 @AntiFeministXX @WayneDupreeShow Can't do the time don't commit the crime. So only men should have to have those benefits?
@adrianopolite @bintlaxoox Who invented the iPhone again?
@bintlaxoox @adrianopolite Imagination and reality are two different things.
@bintlaxoox @adrianopolite Present the ways to make the country better to your representative.
@bintlaxoox @adrianopolite Your viewpoint is that of opposition. Opposition to a country that is bigger than you. If you oppose the laws of a country expect the laws to oppose you back.
@bintlaxoox @adrianopolite Your speech directs hate towards me based on what I choose to laugh at or not in a free country. I have liberty and you will not deprive me off it. I will follow the law and help to make this country great.
@adrianopolite @bintlaxoox You just keep trashing this great country and expect the country to give you something in return.
@bintlaxoox @adrianopolite Isn't twitter considered western technology? How come you religion allows you to use it?
@bintlaxoox @adrianopolite I hear Saudia Arabia and Somalia are great this time of year.
@bintlaxoox @adrianopolite How come you are allowed to use the word trigger? You didn't invent it.
@TruthspeakerHQ @stopbeingfamous In the USA we have people who are elected to write laws. The citizens viewpoint on what the law or rule should be does not overrule the law.
@TruthspeakerHQ @stopbeingfamous I know what urban dictionary is. That is the purpose of a dictionary. People don't get paid for the words they invent or use. That would mean you would owe 1500 for the tweet you just made. All money going to the people who invented the words. I owe 1750.
@bintlaxoox @adrianopolite Which society are you talking about?
@TalbertSwan You have bishop in your name but not in your words.
@TalbertSwan Actually I don't know if this would rise to the level of terrorism. It might. However it looks like murder that may be racially motivated. I hope the man is caught and brought to justice.
Guy thinks people should be hired and fired based on race and not qualification. https://t.co/tMPMh7sTi5
@JimTrotter_NFL Why are you counting the races?
@Ajd8899 @AntiFeministXX @WayneDupreeShow Next you will be suggesting we have a white league and a black league.
@Ajd8899 @AntiFeministXX @WayneDupreeShow Women are gaining an unfair advantage by only having to compete against other women.
@Ajd8899 @AntiFeministXX @WayneDupreeShow Nope that is discriminatory.
@SorayaMcDonald Sounds like you have a problem with the first amendment.
@stopbeingfamous I am confused what your life and the present day has to do with other people's lives and the racism and oppression they faced in the past.
@Playsangry @WayneDupreeShow It is unfair that Alabama and the Patriots are so dominant in their sport. That is the way it is. You have to be better than your opponent. That is what sport is about.
@Ajd8899 @AntiFeministXX @WayneDupreeShow And compare the short players dominance to that of the tall.
@Ajd8899 @AntiFeministXX @WayneDupreeShow In your logic we should make a tall and short NBA.
@NuBlacc Don't be the same as the fire you fight.
@NuBlacc I know that. The framework of the narrative depends of the motive and intentions of those who write it. Fighting fire with fire makes the fire worse. Water is the opposite of fire.
@stopbeingfamous You don't write the laws and you opinions are not ultimatums.
@stopbeingfamous I am not sure what you mean. Is it because of my race or skin color?
@NuBlacc I am part Irish do you see the point.
@NuBlacc You could help me by telling me the point.
@Ajd8899 @AntiFeministXX @WayneDupreeShow You sound like a pro-discrimination anti-woman activist. I suggest all people COMPETE in one sport and the most dominant will win.
@Ajd8899 @AntiFeministXX @WayneDupreeShow No all women should be able to COMPETE in sport.
@Ajd8899 @AntiFeministXX @WayneDupreeShow You have too many gender stereotypes in your arguments.
@Ajd8899 @AntiFeministXX @WayneDupreeShow There are women that are stronger than men. 		https://t.co/E4CmfTXTxI
@Ajd8899 @AntiFeministXX @WayneDupreeShow You are afraid of females dominating you.
@Ajd8899 @AntiFeministXX @WayneDupreeShow I feel pretty confident saying that their are females that could beat you at your favorite sport.
@Ajd8899 @AntiFeministXX @WayneDupreeShow Some females beat out males in the marines.
@Ajd8899 @AntiFeministXX @WayneDupreeShow In your opinion that is what it is. I don't agree.
@Ajd8899 @AntiFeministXX @WayneDupreeShow She could be  disqualified for using the drug but not for gender.
@Ajd8899 @AntiFeministXX @WayneDupreeShow It is for a therapeutic reason. Dr approved. Not specifically for sports.
@Ajd8899 @AntiFeministXX @WayneDupreeShow By the way you can't imply my motive you have to prove it. Nice opinion though.
@Ajd8899 @AntiFeministXX @WayneDupreeShow This is the law. This is not the routine. The women that choose to participate in the sports accept what happens to them not you. Who are you the father to all women everywhere?
@Ajd8899 @AntiFeministXX @WayneDupreeShow Is safety is important in sports why do they allow physical contact at all? In addition every major athlete has numerous injuries. Sports are not safe. If you want safety become an accountant.
@Ajd8899 @AntiFeministXX @WayneDupreeShow Weight class is not sex, religion, race, or any other characteristic that qualifies a rule to be discriminatory.
@Ajd8899 @AntiFeministXX @WayneDupreeShow Your viewpoint is sexist and discriminatory.
@NuBlacc You invented all those words you used in your  tweet. Is that the joke?
@stopbeingfamous I don't see your point. Urban means in, relating to, or characteristic of a city or town. If you are saying that a white man can't own Urban Dictionary on the basis of his race you are not only discriminating but you are also trying to deprive someone of their property.
@TheRoot Do you feel that he should have been shot and killed? Or rather do you feel that the black men should be treated the same way he was in similar circumstances?
@MeritLaw Hopefully he is caught and prosecuted under the laws we have for all men and women.
@newsone I agree this man needs to be caught. It is not ok to do that to any person.
@Playsangry @WayneDupreeShow Calling me an idiot does not take away my constitutional right to speech or to have an opinion.
@Playsangry @WayneDupreeShow You do not have to see them as male or female but realize that your dehumanization of them and insults will get you no respect from them or the people who support them.
@Playsangry @WayneDupreeShow You are depriving them of the liberty to live their life as the gender they choose. The US Constitution says no person should be deprived of life, liberty, and/or property.
@Playsangry @WayneDupreeShow Denying a man the opportunity to participate in anything a female can legally participate in and vice versa is considered discrimination based on sex. You with your viewpoint openly discriminate.
@Playsangry @WayneDupreeShow People who play professional sports get paid based on their dominance. If a female starts to dominate in the one sports league for both men and women she should be paid according to her worth and dominance. You viewpoint is discriminatory and sexist.
@Playsangry @WayneDupreeShow LOL. How does having an opposite view of you make me an idiot? Who cares if the men are more dominant? Sports are about dominance.
@AntiFeministXX @WayneDupreeShow I see your point. I didn't read the article at first.
@AntiFeministXX @WayneDupreeShow Either way I don't see why it matters. Women and men are considered equal under the law so why should she or he be denied the opportunity to wrestle against the females? There should be one wrestling team for both genders.
@RealJamesWoods Why aren't these people that scream Allah and stab, blow up, or shoot someone charged with hate crimes?
@WayneDupreeShow I hardly see the logic in cheering for a girl who competes on the football team but booing a man that competes on the wrestling team. If I were a female I would enjoy the challenge of competing against a man.
@WayneDupreeShow In addition men and women compete for the same jobs today. You cannot bar a woman from holding the same position as a man or vice versa. I find the seperation of sports into both male and female is highly discrimanitory. There should be one team all genders compete to make.
@WayneDupreeShow I honestly don't see your point. When I was in high school there were two girls who played lineman on the football team. If women are allowed to compete in male sports why shouldn't men or men that identify as female be allowed to compete in female sports.
@_AintHavinIt @rekjos @KamalaHarris That seems discriminatory to only give the Middle Class tax breaks. Laws are supposed to apply to everyone.
@ChrChristensen So she fled from civil war in Somalia only to be accepted into the US under Asylum and is now a  Member of the Minnesota House of Representatives but America is not a "Golden Land". Where exactly would she be if she never received Asylum?
@ChrChristensen But from “the first day we arrived in America,” she said, she concluded that it was not the golden land that she had heard about.
@ChrChristensen When she was 8, Somalia erupted into civil war, and her extended family fled to a refugee camp in Kenya, where they spent four years before seeking asylum in the United States in 1995.
@AOC You actually were just elected to represent the issues facing New York's 14th congressional district not the planet. I guess rising water levels can be a threat to your district.
@dEmNTROPY @TianaTheFirst Do you have a link to what you are referring?
@JessReports @HuffPost @gchaslot I search for what I want to see and use what I know to make an informed and educated decision about the truthfulness and accurateness of the content.
@TianaTheFirst That is terrible. I think the United Nations should outlaw the practice.
@rose_ebue @momadonanohio @ScottPresler @ChelseaClinton You might enjoy watching this...		https://t.co/SJr72USFmk
@rose_ebue @momadonanohio @ScottPresler @ChelseaClinton Asylum should be given to those that qualify for the requirements.
@rose_ebue @momadonanohio @ScottPresler @ChelseaClinton Some people may be in a rush to get in your door. Does this mean you remove all your requirements to open it?
@rose_ebue @momadonanohio @ScottPresler @ChelseaClinton You most likely have a door to your home. People knock on your door. The people you like and are friendly with you let in. The strangers you ask questions before you let in. If the stranger does not meet your requirements you close the door. If they do you open it.
@rose_ebue @momadonanohio @ScottPresler @ChelseaClinton I understand but the perspective of the immigrants may not match the perspective of the country they are fleeing. Open arms should only accept others with open arms. What are the motives and intentions of all that are accepted once they are? Nobody truly knows.
@rose_ebue @momadonanohio @ScottPresler @ChelseaClinton Ok. I agree. I don't think they all are following the procedures to apply for asylum.
@rose_ebue @momadonanohio @ScottPresler @ChelseaClinton What is the basis for their claim to asylum? Every person that is coming is not from the same country. You cannot generalize and say that they all are legally allowed to enter because of asylum claims. Each individual case is different. Therefore some may be entering illegally.
@rose_ebue @momadonanohio @ScottPresler @ChelseaClinton I am not judging them for looking for a better life. I wish them all the best and hope all turns out well and do not see them as enemies.  Sometimes you must stand your ground. It may seem wrong in the moment but often times turns out to be right.
@rose_ebue @momadonanohio @ScottPresler @ChelseaClinton I do sometimes imagine if I was in their shoes. Finding the right path in life is hard. My shoes have been on this side of the border so for me it must be easier. I don't control the mother and father I am born. Nor do I control the landmass I call home at birth.
@rose_ebue @momadonanohio @ScottPresler @ChelseaClinton We can not turn a lawful society into a lawless one because we would become just as dangerous as the country they flee.
@rose_ebue @momadonanohio @ScottPresler @ChelseaClinton Well there is nothing wrong with wanting a better life. There is however something wrong with breaking the law. Which law is the most important to enforce and not enforce I am not the judge?

@Tlewis1026 @BreitbartNews Don't call her that she is plainly a woman. Can't you see that?
@BreitbartNews She basically vandalized the store and threatened to fight the cashier.
@rose_ebue @momadonanohio @ScottPresler @ChelseaClinton How is the government corruption of one country the responsibility of another? These people are citizens of another country. It is their responsibility to rid their own country of corruption.
@rose_ebue @momadonanohio @ScottPresler @ChelseaClinton Why is the United States the destination of choice?
@BridgetPhetasy But calling them names is considered hate speech.
@KamalaHarris How does requiring people to buy private insurance make it a right? Also how is it fair that some people have to pay more than others? Why do you consider the ACA the law that makes healthcare a right? If it were a right I wouldn't need to pay for it.
@RealCandaceO I said that minorities have a voice of their own and don't need her to defend them. Then the white female gender studies  college professor told me to f off and blocked me. She thinks that my political views and I just disappear from the face of the Earth with a block on twitter.
@dbongino @ChrisCuomo He is a Democrat and hates privilege.
@dbongino They put a center median (wall) between two opposing sides of a highway to help protect both drivers from a head on collision. If medians (walls) didn't work why would they do this?
@IlhanMN Are accusing someone of holding paychecks hostage? I didn't know by law holding paychecks hostage was possible.
@rose_ebue @momadonanohio @ScottPresler @ChelseaClinton I think the non-violent people in Mexico, South and Central America who believe in what is right should band together and make sure their countries are safe. I am rooting for them.
@rose_ebue @momadonanohio @ScottPresler @ChelseaClinton Suggestions on how to run another country? Don't these countries have people elected to do that?
@rose_ebue @momadonanohio @ScottPresler @ChelseaClinton Why not try to make their home country better? Those violent men are their children.
@moruagut39 @momadonanohio @ScottPresler @ChelseaClinton I blame the people that make their home country so dangerous.
@rose_ebue @momadonanohio @ScottPresler @ChelseaClinton I never said I didn't understand why they left. I said when they left they took responsibility for what happened to them or their children.
@UTContractor @moruagut39 @momadonanohio @ScottPresler @ChelseaClinton I agree. Check out this article. They were just trying to catch the bus. https://t.co/GHgbsTtTlQ
@pris_001 @EricBusy64 @AndileisRight @News24 Or just have thick skin and be smarter than them.
@Mike_Saltsman Maybe NY should give everybody a tax break like they did Amazon.
@Mike_Saltsman Yeah business owners are closing their restaurants because the people that work there might actually be able to afford to eat there. Close the business another will open. So people are supposed to care only for the business owner and not the workers?
Twitter is being used as a tool for harassment and vigilante justice by angry mobs.
@EricBusy64 @AndileisRight @News24 You have to be careful today some of these people try to get you angry so you say something dumb. I agree with you.
@MsDeepSeduction Ok I understand why he was arrested but why were the other people not arrested for urinating and crapping on his porch. Seems like the DA is only half doing their job.
@realDonaldTrump @JesseBWatters Since Obama was considered such a great president and he presided over the bailout of the financial industry. I think if the stock market starts to tank you should double if not triple the amount of money used for quantitative easing. So that stocks can be pushed even higher.
@vee8V @ChelseaClinton LOL! When juveniles are shot in the inner city the Democrats blame the government for not doing enough to prevent the gun violence. Democrats never think that the people that vote for them should be held accountable for anything. Tell me who is to blame for the murders?
@DTPORGE @ScottPresler @ChelseaClinton Sir I find it offensive that you defend immigrants more than native born people. I have nothing against immigrants and believe that they should be allowed to become US citizens. However, Your stance that they are somehow more immaculate than native born people is completely false
@DTPORGE @ScottPresler @ChelseaClinton There are more American citizens in America than immigrants. If you brought over the same amount of immigrants as there are American citizens the crime rate between the two would be about the same.
@momadonanohio @ScottPresler @ChelseaClinton Actually it is the parents responsibility. The parents brought their child here illegally. If they never made the long journey their kid would still be alive.
@ScottPresler @ChelseaClinton I know. Anytime a police officer or a citizen is murdered they don't say anything. However if a guy on pcp is resisting arrest and putting officer lives in jeopardy and is shot suddenly they care. It seems to be a way for the Democrats to get votes from the population.
@ChelseaClinton Considering the stance of Democrats is that abortion should be legal so a woman can terminate her pregnancy, I am surprised that the death of any child makes you emotional or sad. Seems like you only want to use the death of these two children as a political talking point.
@ChelseaClinton Must be easy for you to judge the work of others knowing that you will never have to do it.

@Pavelnadolski @JudePax @QueenMab87 Oh wow I am a tool now too. So your opinion is that I am a grammatically challenged bot that is a tool. If I am a bot why do you keep responding? If I am grammatically challenged how do you respond to my tweets? What did I say that makes me a tool?
@snowconvallaria @Pavelnadolski @QueenMab87 White people don't have to compete? Name me a white person that doesn't have to compete.
@snowconvallaria @Pavelnadolski @QueenMab87 Good thing they have great healthcare to heals their wounds.
@snowconvallaria @Pavelnadolski @QueenMab87 The swiss are suffering from these plights?
@THA_KZZA @TalbertSwan @LoveIrreverence They explain it everyday.
@brianoshepherd @TalbertSwan Could you explain to me exactly what is the truth he is preaching?
@yungsweetpea_ Not really sure what he did wrong here. It looks like the woman was harassing him. Why were they harassing him?
@TheSun What that man did is completely and utterly vile and disgusting on so many levels. Nothing she did to him could have equaled the pain and suffering he caused her.
@wolfblitzer Glad to hear another honest and unbiased review free from nepotism and political cronyism.
@Pavelnadolski @QueenMab87 Don't vote for me. I don't want your vote. I want you to sit there and tell everyone that voted for me that I am a criminal. I hope in turn they call you a bot and say you are bad at grammar.
@Pavelnadolski @QueenMab87 I am going to run for president. Then I am going to set up a foundation. Next I am going to get paid 250,000 dollars a speech by all the people I did favors for while I was president. Don't worry I won't leave my wife out of it will let her give speeches for 300,000.
@Pavelnadolski @JudePax @QueenMab87 Yeah. Right you are a leader and not a follower. That is why you call everyone that you disagree with a bot and attack them on their grammer.
@Pavelnadolski @JudePax @QueenMab87 Good thing other people come up with ideas that you can use in your tweets otherwise you wouldn't have much to say.
@Pavelnadolski @JudePax @QueenMab87 This sounds more like a you issue. Here I provided you a link. I wish you the best in catching up with me.		https://t.co/JTpCOoj3Kt

@Pavelnadolski @JudePax @QueenMab87 Wow, this is really getting good. Your criticisms of me are so accurate.
@cdubb_3 @Alyssa_Milano Let's all go enter Alyssa's house without her permission to become permanent residents of it because we have less money than her.

@SarahKSilverman Nope. No. Not true. Lies. This must be one of the many times you lie.
@Pavelnadolski @JudePax @QueenMab87 Maybe you can steal all my ideas and claim they were made by you. Turn the page and burn the rest.
@Pavelnadolski @JudePax @QueenMab87 If the only thing you can criticize me for is my grammar my talking points must be pretty good.
@snowconvallaria @Pavelnadolski @QueenMab87 Didn't those people you are talking about earn their place?
@Pavelnadolski @JudePax @QueenMab87 LOL! I am either bad at grammar or a bot. Your talking points are really hard to prove wrong.
@snowconvallaria @Pavelnadolski @QueenMab87 Yeah Switzerland is a diverse paradise.
@Pavelnadolski @JudePax @QueenMab87 If I follow you can I ask you to proofread my tweets before I send them?
@Pavelnadolski @JudePax @QueenMab87 You will always have a job as a second grade grammar teacher.
@Pavelnadolski @JudePax @QueenMab87 Hey did I put the period in the right place in this sentence?
@Pavelnadolski @QueenMab87 @JudePax I really hope they start calling reporters that at the White House press conferences that way the people in office can be more like the people in the country they represent.
@Pavelnadolski @QueenMab87 @JudePax You should all speak more nicely and try to be a little more politically correct. I would hate to say something to one of you that might get me arrested. Glad to see you all get to express yourself so freely.
@snowconvallaria @Pavelnadolski @QueenMab87 LOL! What exactly did we screw up?
@JasonPtrDavies @QueenMab87 @JudePax @Pavelnadolski I still don't know who you are talking with. Who is Jonathan?
@JasonPtrDavies @QueenMab87 @JudePax @Pavelnadolski I drink perrier with my pinky out and have a louis vuitton purse I think I know better than you.
@JasonPtrDavies @QueenMab87 @JudePax @Pavelnadolski Its the patriarchy's fault I failed that math test.
@JasonPtrDavies @QueenMab87 @JudePax @Pavelnadolski Nope. I deserve to be a professor for saying no. They need to make jobs only for me. Nope to anything you say.
@JasonPtrDavies @QueenMab87 @JudePax @Pavelnadolski Nope. Wrong. I am a victim. I deserve a place at the table.
@QueenMab87 Nope. Not true. Very contradictory. Where did you get this from. What is that even accurate? Totally false.
@QueenMab87 No. This is false. Wrong. Not true. Completely inaccurate.
@QueenMab87 @JasonPtrDavies @JudePax @Pavelnadolski No. No I don't do that. No. Where did I do that? No. Not true. Lies. False.
@QueenMab87 @JasonPtrDavies @JudePax @Pavelnadolski It is comical.
@QueenMab87 @JasonPtrDavies @JudePax @Pavelnadolski No. No I didn't. No. I did not say that. Where did I say that? Huh? What? I disagree so you are wrong. What? Huh? No.
@QueenMab87 @JasonPtrDavies @JudePax @Pavelnadolski You just deny everything.
@JasonPtrDavies @JudePax @QueenMab87 @Pavelnadolski I don't feel as if I have any obligation at all to let anything balance out. You say that if I work just as hard as her or another minority my work should be ignored to let it balance out in favor of her. Why? I don't owe her anything. I don't owe anyone else anything.
@QueenMab87 You say it and say no I didn't say it.
@QueenMab87 You deny everything you claim.
@QueenMab87 You do. You think because you have "worked" for a PHD a job should be there for you at the college.
@QueenMab87 Just out of curiosity, what were the names of every author of the books you read in college and who were the authors that inspired them? You turn the page and burn the pages left behind.
@QueenMab87 So does everybody else.
@QueenMab87 You are wearing a button that says resist. If you are not oppressed what would you need to resist for?
@amratner @QueenMab87 I didn't vote for Trump. I didn't wear a maga hat. Your words are a better representation of you and your false reality.
@QueenMab87 @JudePax @Pavelnadolski That is a generalization. The very thought that you need to defend and help a black woman achieve success is sexist and racist. Why can't she do it without you? Serana needs Mia. Beyonce needs Mia. Oprah needs Mia. All black women everywhere need Mia.
@QueenMab87 Wright brothers invented flight without a PHD. Bezos invented Amazon without a PHD. Gates founded Mocrosoft without a PHD. So what you spent money to read books. Others just do it for free.
@QueenMab87 What is a PhD? What does that even matter? There are people that have PhDs that are unemployed.
@QueenMab87 You are so powerful. You will bring down the walls of the oppressors. Everyone is shaking and scared that you have an opinion.
@QueenMab87 What are you resisting for?
@QueenMab87 @amratner Oh hero, you believe in your cause so that makes it right. You have friends that follow you and agree with you as well. This makes you right and all that disagree wrong. The resources should all be given to you. Your life should be made easy and the others should serve you.
@amratner @QueenMab87 See that judged by one who doesn't even know me. Calls me a names filled with hate. But needs protection.
@amratner @QueenMab87 That is nice what makes me an obvious idiot Ari?
@QueenMab87 Um yeah that is pretty much what I said except for you put no it front of it.
@QueenMab87 @JudePax @Pavelnadolski Where? Which black women?
@writerguydell @QueenMab87 Which men in particular are you talking about?
@QueenMab87 You are the one who thinks the world owes you something so why don't you tell me.
@JudePax @QueenMab87 @Pavelnadolski Some have AIDS every day. Some die of Ebola. Some become wealthy well beyond their means.
@QueenMab87 You are hardly the most oppressed.
@QueenMab87 @JudePax @Pavelnadolski You picked the fight. Your words called out white men. Hello my race happens to be white male. Did you take notice? You are the one who chooses to light fires and spread hate. Any words can be said but you chose white man.
@JudePax @QueenMab87 @Pavelnadolski Are there no black male privileged people? Are there no Indian male privileged people? Are there no Asian male privileged people? Are there no black, Asian, or Indian female people? I think the answer to this is yes. So why again is the focus only on white male people?
@JudePax @QueenMab87 @Pavelnadolski Oh king please spare me some of your precious time. Us that are told are privileged are really in positions more deserved by you.
@JudePax @QueenMab87 @Pavelnadolski If you pick a fight with someone don't cry victim when they choose to fight back.
@JudePax @QueenMab87 @Pavelnadolski Everyone in life has to to struggle to survive but your viewpoint is that you must struggle harder because all people do not accept you. You are privileged compared to some. You are the oppressor also to some. Some are the oppressors to you and others are yet more priveleged.
@JudePax @QueenMab87 @Pavelnadolski What are you even talking about? Who said that? I shouldn't have to explain what I say to you like you were a child if you are over the age of 18.
@dan_beats @senorastacy @spiderstacy You just inspired me to follow some new people.
@dan_beats @senorastacy @spiderstacy You say I am a bot it must be true because your mom thinks you are special.
@dan_beats @senorastacy @spiderstacy That is all you know. LOL!
@dan_beats @senorastacy @spiderstacy You definitely are wrong.
@dan_beats @senorastacy @spiderstacy Am I not allowed to do what I think is fun? Are you the government? Are you in charge of writing the laws? Do I answer to you?
@scottdempsey @viruk42 Do you have a problem with me disagreeing with what she said and responding with my own viewpoint?
@dan_beats @senorastacy @spiderstacy I am not breaking any of the guidelines of twitter.
@dan_beats @senorastacy @spiderstacy I can choose to use twitter for whatever purpose I wish. You are not in charge of twitter nor are you in charge of me or what I should do. If you want to be someone's father you should have kids and cease talking to me like you are mine.
@dan_beats @senorastacy @spiderstacy News is written by humans.
@dan_beats @senorastacy @spiderstacy Twitter is a platform that is open to the public. If you make a comment on Twitter that can be seen as offensive to someone you better be prepared to explain it. If you want your comment to be private say it in private.
@dan_beats @senorastacy @spiderstacy Your opinion of what is odd and what is not odd means very little to me.
@dan_beats @senorastacy @spiderstacy My attacking people. I am merely defending myself.
@scottdempsey @viruk42 What are you talking about? Your attempt to make me look foolish is only exposing yourself as a fool. Do you need me to clarify my tweet so you can understand better what I was trying to say?
@scottdempsey @viruk42 She does not have the power to fire him. She believes that she should. She has little disregard for the man's life. She also in making the statement shows little or no constraint or acknowledgement of her own faults as if she were a perfect god.
@scottdempsey @viruk42 Those are some accepted definitions of what a God is. When she prescribes a punishment for a man based on her own beliefs and suggests that she would do better than that man she in my opinion is acting as if she was a God.
@scottdempsey @viruk42 1 the supreme or ultimate reality: such as	a: the Being perfect in power, wisdom, and goodness who is worshipped as creator and ruler of the universe	2: a being or object believed to have more than natural attributes and powers and to require human worship	3: a powerful ruler
@dan_beats @senorastacy @spiderstacy Why do you want to know?
@QueenMab87 @Pavelnadolski Are you talking about Moore here?
@Pavelnadolski @QueenMab87 I think your tweet just died as well.
@RealLiquidMnkey @DEADLINE Does she have to say something profound she is an athlete? Therefore she equals god.
@QueenMab87 Ok when clarified so that it no longer includes me I don't take issue with it.
@sunnysingh_n6 LOL! From the looks of it you are the one who is crying.
@viruk42 People do those things. Man/woman murders.
@thisisntcraig @DEADLINE They share everything except for their money.
@hardovski @joss_rogue @DEADLINE Lebron never had to work a job. He went in the NBA right from High School.
@DaveedWoW @DEADLINE The truth ain't so true anymore.
@DEADLINE Everybody that disagrees with him needs to be quiet and realize that scoring a triple double makes you a genius.
@RealLiquidMnkey @DEADLINE That female broke all the barriers and glass ceilings in male sports.
@walaamara @DEADLINE This woman is acting like a slave master because she is telling people what to be offended by and not giving them any pay.
@walaamara @DEADLINE I will choose to offended by what I want. Thank you very much Master.
@DontMenschenit @overanalyze1421 @DEADLINE It is sad that she needed that explained.
@SheriffClarke That is a very good point Mr. Clarke.
@sunnysingh_n6 @DerSPIEGEL If you said, it is funny how in some occasions people are not responsible or guilty because they are sick, I would agree. Your statement proves to be both racist and sexist motivated by hatred for the white man or men in question.
@sunnysingh_n6 @DerSPIEGEL I don't think your statement is accurate.
@viruk42 @icehockeystick @usahockey Who exactly are you calling a malevolent dick?

@AlexVickeryHowe @DerekLalonde2 @kathygriffin Must be easy for you to ignore facts.
@kathygriffin Good thing you are a comedian and not to be taken seriously.
@QueenMab87 What was the factual race and gender description you pointed about the white man?
@BLeet_ They must not do too much research at your newspaper.
@Kojobalewa Just curious to know where you think would be in Africa if your ancestors were never brought over here. At least the white man admitted his mistakes and helped fight a war to end the practice of slavery in his country.
@Kojobalewa Last time I checked those were not white men.		https://t.co/jJG3zgkZhm		https://t.co/aJSLYSZjSn		https://t.co/IYeWKyORXw
@Kojobalewa The government was not the same in those times. The people you are angry about in your tweet are all gone. You are spreading anger and hate today based on something that happened yesterday.
@Lihlefonk @LandNoli @ConfessionWhite Your quote is a generalization. Who is they? What is the context in which each was killed? Why is it right to kill either a black man or a white man?
@JuneWav Quit kidding around. You wouldn't really do that.
@UncededClothing I am not sure what point you are trying to make. Not every person thinks like this.
@QueenMab87 @Pavelnadolski It is pretty sad when your best talking point is to accuse men with wives, daughters, and associates who are of different races of being sexist and racist.
@viruk42 @icehockeystick @usahockey How could you even know that?
@QueenMab87 That was said after your original tweet clearly stating white man.
@icehockeystick @CindyDemopoulos Put that on your resume and apply for the job at USA hockey. Are you calling me a bigot?
@QueenMab87 Why are you criticizing white men? Why did you specifically state white men? Why not people or a specific person who did something?
@senorastacy @spiderstacy Once again I will remember how you treated me on this day. When one questions why I view humanity with such a dim light I will pull up the screenshot of your tweet.
@CindyDemopoulos @icehockeystick Cover Hockey? She suggested that she be put in charge of USA hockey all together. What are you even talking about?
@QueenMab87 @FikeMartin My point was that he doesn't even know what he is talking about.
@FikeMartin @QueenMab87 I don't understand why you get to not take me seriously but you are to be taken seriously. You dis-respected me today. I won't forget that.
@QueenMab87 @Pavelnadolski I fail to recognize how your focus on WHITE MEN is not both sexist and racist. I am pretty sure you point out both a race and a gender. How are you any better? You think because you are a woman that you point comes from a stance of innocence. I would say that is sexist in itself.
@QueenMab87 Take notice to the capitalized words that you used. Now say what you just said again.		You:	Why can’t I criticize any WHITE MAN in politics without y’all somehow making me defend Hillary??
@FikeMartin @QueenMab87 Man are you seriously a grown man sending a picture of a cartoon to make a point? Is this supposed to further validate your first point or mine?
@senorastacy @spiderstacy You are allowed to have an opinion. I just don't think very highly of it.
@FikeMartin @QueenMab87 What are you even talking about?
@Pavelnadolski @QueenMab87 I don't understand how you can say white men screwed up if they supposedly have all the power. Which side of your mouth are you talking out of?
@QueenMab87 My question is why is your focus specifically on white men?
@icehockeystick That went exactly where I thought it would go. Nowhere.
@usmcboyer @NPR They got rid of the Christmas party at the government office I worked in America.
@Fightforgingers @ColeC95094558 @BBCWorld I know.
@ColeC95094558 @Fightforgingers @BBCWorld My grandfather was left handed and was forced to learn to write with his right hand.
@AyandaGashi So what I gather from this truth that is spoken is, a white woman could agree with everything you say in her heart but she still isn't you ally. What knowledge do you hold that enables you to make such a claim?
@spiderstacy Hey what company do you sell whiskey for?
@Morgan64761293 @MARYJANESPETER @ghostofthor I would say that is definitely discriminating against white people. Could you send me the link to that job?
@spiderstacy Taking pictures of other people you don't know while they sleep is a little bit creepy. Besides aren't you the one doing whatever you want by taking his picture?
@icehockeystick You really think someone would hire you if you said that.
@thevincentpress @jwheels74 It is amazing how you know the outcomes to things that did not happen.
@icehockeystick What exactly makes you qualified?
@icehockeystick What is your evidence that all of hockey is bigoted?
@icehockeystick You think it is bigoted. Once again that is your opinion.
@icehockeystick You really are trying to advocate you be hired based on your morals and not your qualifications.
@icehockeystick @JD_Jerbear People would quit working for you as soon as you started to talk.
@icehockeystick @JD_Jerbear You have an opinion that hockey is bigoted. It is only your opinion.
@icehockeystick What does that have to do with hockey or selling tickets?
@icehockeystick So all of hockey is filled with bigotry because one person was heard saying the n word on one occasion? You hardly seem to be making any good points.
@RealTrumpsHair2 @Rob_Rogers @AUMichaelBrown What does being a rich white man have to do with anything?
@wandamvu I don't understand I thought it was sexist to call a women a whore. Have the rules changed again or something?
@ArchieJune @ambitiousgrl22 This post seems shallow. Are you saying the people's social status should depend on how hot they are?
@hwyteman @xCarolinaSweets I used to pretend to be things I wasn't when I was 11.
@hanayahx You think people should be fired for saying the n word but probably think ex-cons that are guilty of felonies should get jobs.
@icehockeystick Sounds like you would turn hockey into a tea party.
@icehockeystick In your opinion God has nothing to do with this. Why would anybody appoint you to be the head of USA hockey?
@icehockeystick @usahockey Maybe if we replaced God with you the world would be a better place.
@TalbertSwan The world is full of messages the inhabitants of it spread.
@Blavity Crime is not unique to any one race. This proves only that the man in question is bad.
@StevenCanals I don't understand the logic. Let's say there was a white man that spent all of his life helping black people. He gave his time and effort to make sure that they succeeded in life. One day he says the n word. You would judge the man as racist for use of the word one day?
@MuslimIQ Not all cops in every town are the same. Not all white people are the same. Maybe the man was treated this way in this circumstance because the cops are more professional. Maybe the cops who shot the boy were racist. Every situation is different.
@AndileMngxitam1 I think you should be more specific as to who is the cause of your problems. I am a white man and have never set foot in SA.
@1IronMan2018 Isn't that where the liberal hero Edward Snowden is?
@Mizzling_Gaze I guess weddings and picnics are not the best because they are planned.
@feelTHEnature_ Go to the desert and say that.
@KingFavre How long until they kick you off twitter?
Politicians sure don't have any problem raising taxes and fees on citizens. They sure do have a problem raising the wages and benefits we all get.		Uber and Lyft rides may get more expensive in NYC: https://t.co/y6AKqDNllf

@shannonrwatts Adam Lanza had access to guns through his mother.
@shannonrwatts @rtraister Your bias is showing.
@willishl @shannonrwatts @joanwalsh @rtraister I doubt it, exaggerate much?
@shannonrwatts @rtraister What does white have to do with anything? Besides you fall into that category. If what you say is true you are a most eager foot soldier.
@goldyn_charity @DonCarlozA @ameyaw112 That ain't a young boy it is a man.
@goldyn_charity @ameyaw112 So you feel men should have to act a certain way but women should not? What if a young woman was sitting and an old man was standing?
@tim_fargo LOL! I am going to go mess somebody up with my laughter.
@MrsKrabapple @UN_Women Yes it should be but the evil white man made her say girls.
@BobbieMtastic @UN_Women Yeah right is that why feminism is based on the principle that men kept women down for thousands of years and are still doing it?
@UN_Women Ok lets destroy everything men did start over and let women actually do everything men did.
@David_Leavitt "Repeat a lie often enough and it becomes the truth”, is a law of propaganda often attributed to the Nazi Joseph Goebbels.   		Way to go taking pages out of Nazi playbooks.
@NBCNews LOL! Well that is a lesson for them. Don't let you toddler play with your cash.
@DickDurbin LOL! Rigged you sound like your boy Donald Trump.
@mcatty_alex @SharedMotivati1 You are way behind the curve.
@kodiakinkevlar @AmishPornStar1 Yeah man that would make America even greater. Another license, yep, pure genius is at work here.
@womenoutdoors @SharedMotivati1 Oh yeah you are right the sharks force isn't equal it is greater. My bad.
@womenoutdoors @SharedMotivati1 Really? How about a hungry shark?
@YoloDoItBald @SharedMotivati1 Like what for example?
@TalbertSwan Just to think that if I would by some luck become rich because I am white I would have to be held accountable really doesn't sit well with me. Some people may like what you have to say but I find it to be very offensive, hateful, hurtful, and also to be fighting words.
@heyjacqui_ How does one get as smart as you?
@DailyCaller @GlenWoodfin She is that one professor that rates your papers bad if you look like a white Republican. I had a professor like her.
@DailyCaller @GlenWoodfin We wouldn't even be hearing these views if it wasn't for affirmative action. Thank you affirmative action.
@1stamendment76 @GartrellLinda Bro I am so tired of it. The one lefty I met in conversation told me I wasn't allowed to make generalizations or stereotypes. He proceded to make generalization after generalization. I pointed this out to him and he still thought that it was ok for him to do it.
@GartrellLinda @GlenWoodfin Yep this is pretty much the standard of the left. Anyone says these things about them they demand that they are immediately fired. However the left can say whatever they want about anyone and feel they should keep their job. Usually when they are fired for what they say they sue.
@shelisutz @coolghost101 Oh your opinion is just so wonderful because all of your teachers told you how great you are because they didn't want to hurt your feelings because your parents might sue. Now go tell your mommy I hurt your feelings.
@shelisutz @coolghost101 Nope.
@AgoristKitty You are the one that holds the popular opinion.
@AgoristKitty @baronA5H It really is sad that you think that people who lie are loving.		Lying is trying to decieve someone with a false statement.		Love is unselfish loyal concern for another.		Hate is to have a strong aversion toward.		Someone with a strong aversion is more likely to lie to another.
@AgoristKitty @baronA5H Calling people a troll is loving. You are the good one driving out the hatred.
@AgoristKitty @baronA5H If you don't know I don't have the time to explain it to you.
@AgoristKitty @baronA5H Loving people don't lie.
@AgoristKitty @baronA5H That is hatred. Lying is hatred.
@baronA5H @AgoristKitty So you hate taxes? The only way to lower your taxes is to love them and pay them.
@AgoristKitty @baronA5H Problem solved.
@DarkNookShop @britishbullybee You just didn't catch my point.
@DarkNookShop @britishbullybee Pretty sure the guillotine was invented by Europeans.  		https://t.co/Yfsk0XoB47		From the wiki.		The display of severed heads had long been one of the most common ways a European sovereign displayed his power to his subjects.
@baronA5H @AgoristKitty So what are you going to do use your current hate and disdain for prison to drive out the hatred of the people that want prisons? No,  I forgot you are going to tell them how much you love them.
@mingberg @baronA5H I love everybody even the guy that just kicked me in the face. Give me a break.
@baronA5H @mingberg These stats prove my point. Rapists and murderers are in prison. You are brining other things into the conversation I didn't even mention.
@baronA5H @mingberg Are rapists and murderers in prison?
@baronA5H @mingberg LOL. Ask the government not me.
@baronA5H @mingberg Prisons don't exist without rapists and murderers. 		Prison cannot act it is an institution. 		So you hate prisons?
@baronA5H @mingberg Not really you hate them because you don't rape and murder. They do. In that you are different.
@baronA5H @mingberg The answer is the ones who don't pose a threat to me and do the right thing.
@baronA5H @mingberg Hating murderers and rapists so much that you put them in prison doesn't make the world better we should love them. Yeah man you truly are a present day guru.
@baronA5H @mingberg LOL! You love your enemy.
@baronA5H @mingberg If you love a rapist and a murderer I really feel bad for you.
@baronA5H @mingberg You don't even know what you are talking about. You misconstrue words and have a very poor understanding. Do me a favor save your judgements for yourself.
@PitweetoDrama @DRUDGE_REPORT It is not everyone in the millenials it is just a select special few.
@baronA5H @mingberg Hate has always existed and will continue to do so just as love.
@DarkNookShop @britishbullybee You are a man born of a woman. Your ideologies are born of man and not the universe. Living under your laws is no better than living under the Muslims laws if my views differ from both of you. All men are not free to live as they please but rather are subject to other men's laws.
@baronA5H @mingberg Who is us? Some have benefited greatly where as others not so much.
@DarkNookShop @britishbullybee Muslims make up a Muslim theocratic state. The problem really isn't Muslims it is more ignorance and prideful ways. All ideologies don't mix together. It is like oil and water. You are just as much of a problem to the Muslims as the Muslims are a problem to you.
@DarkNookShop @britishbullybee There are many Muslims in the city I live.
@DarkNookShop @britishbullybee If British rule is so great why do Britts come to the USA and apply for citizenship?
@DarkNookShop @britishbullybee Which people?  I am sure each person has a different reason.
@mingberg Ok but hate can drive out hate. One group who hates another group is occupying land. The second hateful group drives out the first group to take control of the land. Actually one could argue Democrats and Republicans do it all the time.
@britishbullybee Britian only has the wealth it has today because of all the people it killed throughout history. I can't imagine all the rapes and pillaging that went on by all the soldiers when a new land was conquered. But the Britts really are a civilized bunch.
@britishbullybee LOL! A british person criticizing someone else for an invasion. They should come to your country and take everything back you took after the crusades and every other invasion your country did throughout history.
@JedRecord This is something teachers say on a daily basis to their kids. Why should Larry King receive the glory for saying it.
@dovesrose5 @monaeltahawy #FalseAllegationByaWoman
@PeterK0243 @izumofairy @tictoc @hypnoyouellie Bro I think she likes me or something. She seems like one of those women that insults you even though she really likes you. She upped her game to call me pathetic. You think that means she wants to get married?
@PeterK0243 @izumofairy @tictoc @hypnoyouellie I think her favorite word is idiot. Must be some sort of feminist battle cry or something.
@PeterK0243 @izumofairy @tictoc @hypnoyouellie Now she keeps responding back even though she called me an idiot and I told her I wasn't going to talk to someone that belittles me. She really thinks that she has a good argument and points.
@PeterK0243 @izumofairy @tictoc @hypnoyouellie She is one of those people that argue emotionally and not rationally.
@PeterK0243 @izumofairy @tictoc @hypnoyouellie Bro now she called white people rats and we are the racist ones.
@izumofairy @PeterK0243 @tictoc @hypnoyouellie You really think someone you called an idiot wants to hold a conversation with you. If I am an idiot why do you keep talking to me.
@izumofairy @PeterK0243 @tictoc @hypnoyouellie That isn't really a fact the same jobs that exist today didn't exist always. You are oversimplifying a complex situation and your tweet is more of a generalization than a fact.
@izumofairy @PeterK0243 @tictoc @hypnoyouellie You think you are a fairy and you have emojis for a name.
@DougJ7777 Ok Dhoug.
@annemariayritys In the other case the lion would eat all of the sheep and just get fat and lazy and not want to fight.
@annemariayritys The sheep would be eaten by the lions and it would be a lion leading lions.
@maskara72 @TheJordanRachel Yeah they are teaching political beliefs instead of facts.
@Smartassicus @darkmatter_wimp @yourmusicsucks Ok Mr. Itisfromamovie, way to be original.
@Smartassicus @darkmatter_wimp @yourmusicsucks If we are in the position to need help from a guy that thinks it is unsafe to take a selfie without a helmet on God help us all.
@maskara72 @TheJordanRachel Watch out for the sociology professor.
@Smartassicus @darkmatter_wimp @yourmusicsucks What are you a god or something?
@PeterK0243 @tictoc @hypnoyouellie It is just legal sexism and racism. Disqualifying a qualified man because you want to have more women is excluding the man on the basis of gender. Disqualifying a white or Asian person because you want to have more black is excluding the white or Asian person on the basis of race
@kathygriffin @AriFleischer Use of the  F word used to be controversial. Because of the controversy people were drawn to those who said it. Now because people with no class have used it so much the word is no longer controversial. Since your tweet doesn't have much meaning or substance it is rather lame.
@AriFleischer @GlenWoodfin Gotta love people like that. If you would say it back they would probably report you.
@DougJ7777 If you said that to a customer and you worked for me I would fire you.
@mitchellvii @GlenWoodfin So you are basically saying that if he committed the crime you want him on the Supreme Court.
@PardueSuzanne @SharedMotivati1 If Albert Einstein already said it, why do you have to repeat it?
@NancyRichmond What is your point?
@meggdobs Feminism is a terrible philosophy.
@the_mad_duck_ Is there actual proof of this claim or is this another #FalseAccusationByaWoman ?
@SouthernOpine @proudgreygay @StonewallJaxin @CriglerCandice @bsw_35630 @senatemajldr @forgedbytrials_ It makes no sense.
@HadleySheley Not really but it was a nice try.
@GGraphicsinc After people call you dumb so many times on Twitter you kind of grow numb to it.
@SouthernOpine @proudgreygay @StonewallJaxin @CriglerCandice @bsw_35630 @senatemajldr @forgedbytrials_ I heard all those things as well. Yet still no convictions.
@Thanx4AllDaFish @rioglen @Trae_Anderson @CriglerCandice @bsw_35630 @senatemajldr @forgedbytrials_ True.
@Fibutton @SharedMotivati1 Doing laundry, cooking, and cleaning are easy tasks.
@Thanx4AllDaFish @kathy37721481 @rioglen @Trae_Anderson @CriglerCandice @bsw_35630 @senatemajldr @forgedbytrials_ Yeah make her out to be a hero even though the allegation isn't proven yet.
@Thanx4AllDaFish @rioglen @Trae_Anderson @CriglerCandice @bsw_35630 @senatemajldr @forgedbytrials_ You are not supposed to hold that against them. That is a perceived guilt and although might be actual, not because of lack of conviction.
@BelmarCPA @proudgreygay @StonewallJaxin @CriglerCandice @bsw_35630 @senatemajldr @forgedbytrials_ Yeah right I can't read. That is how I read your tweet.
@momentsmom Brought on by Democrats.
@Writerer So Democrats tried to destroy his life back then as well.
@Amit_Lahon That is what he is like when he loses money.
@colettey6 @kanyewest @realDonaldTrump @RealCandaceO If you have a son you should raise him to be just like Kanye.
@AndrewBVCU @CriglerCandice @bsw_35630 @senatemajldr @forgedbytrials_ I agree. If you make a claim like that 37 years later when someone is about to get a good job you better have proof. Otherwise there is going to be a countersuit.
@kathy37721481 @Thanx4AllDaFish @rioglen @Trae_Anderson @CriglerCandice @bsw_35630 @senatemajldr @forgedbytrials_ I wondered the same thing.
@Thanx4AllDaFish @rioglen @Trae_Anderson @CriglerCandice @bsw_35630 @senatemajldr @forgedbytrials_ Actually legally it does.
@Trae_Anderson @rioglen @CriglerCandice @bsw_35630 @senatemajldr @forgedbytrials_ Yeah man if someone isn't found guilty you can't say that.
@CriglerCandice @bsw_35630 @senatemajldr @forgedbytrials_ Ok but if she would have reported the alleged assault back when it happened she wouldn't have to deal with the supposed 37 years. The 37 years of not seeing the alleged perpetrator pay for his crime is because she remained silent.
@BelmarCPA @proudgreygay @StonewallJaxin @CriglerCandice @bsw_35630 @senatemajldr @forgedbytrials_ Nobody said that you were supposed to be terrified. Most people don't get terrified by a meme.
@SouthernOpine @proudgreygay @StonewallJaxin @CriglerCandice @bsw_35630 @senatemajldr @forgedbytrials_ It's just that if a Democrat did the things he did you would disqualify him.
@Cernovich @GlenWoodfin It disgusts me that we have to pay for these people. They act like they can't be replaced. I agree unseal the harrasment cases and get rid of all of the people that committed the crimes. Civilians do years in jail why should government workers be different.
@tedlieu No. The thing is people are not allowed to use past crimes that are alleged to have happened as blackmail. You either press charges or not.
@HeroAssange If he did commit this crime he would never be allowed to become a judge.
@ThAt_PhOtOg_GuY It is a very diverse crowd.
@johnlundin Yeah that would be very good because we live in a country of laws and not men.
@DrDooleyMD So sick of people like you directing hate towards my race.
@dovesrose5 @monaeltahawy Sorry not true. This is why people don't believe women.
@qirennia @monaeltahawy I don't know who said he was entitled to it. Once again you made an assumption as to what I am thinking or thought about the situation.		Also you assumed that I needed to have explained to me the current situation on Kavanaugh.
@qirennia @monaeltahawy You said probably and that means you made a generalization and/or an assumption. The statement you made is not valid or factual. You don't have enough proof to support your claim. Kind of ironic. 		In order to make a valid statement you must have enough evidence to support it.
@monaeltahawy This doesn't even make sense because there are female, black, Asian, Hispanic, etc judges, senators, Reps, and other offices of power.
@monaeltahawy Why wasn't Hillary and Bill prosecuted for the numerous crimes alleged against them?
@monaeltahawy How is this true when there are more men than women in jail?
@raheelium_ @Saisailu97 It never just ends.
@raheelium_ @Saisailu97 You think calling my view dumb and telling me what to do is what men do? Why are you even defending her? If she is free to say what she wants let her defend herself. What are you her mouthpiece?
@raheelium_ @Saisailu97 You just called my view dumb and talked to me like I am your child but you didn't insult me? I am not asking for your permission to do anything.
@raheelium_ @Saisailu97 You are going to tell me what to do. LOL! You really are confused on how life works. Nice great opinion but insulting me ain't really going to help me respect your opinion.
@IBJIYONGI I wasn't aware that there were equal opportunities for men as well.
@Niarayi There are no feminists that hate men?
@_robella I disagree 100%. This is wrong on so many levels.
@SamuraiKnitter Yep but saying this isn't considered terroristic or threatening at all.
@Saisailu97 @raheelium_ LOL! You are saying how dare men say what they want to say and criticizing men for saying how dare women say what they want to say.
@pkpeninsula @GawdSpareUs @australian I have the same view. In an event that I am attacked I have to defend myself. I was threatened in a car park at night.
@GawdSpareUs @australian This utterly ridiculous. I see women walk alone in a car park all the time.
@GawdSpareUs @australian You only get called a liar if you lie. Men are called liars as well. Sometimes men are frightened to be robbed at night when they walk in a car park.
@australian I think it is obvious that women should not just be believed. There always has to be proof to substantiate their claims. Nobody knows the mental health or personal life of these people making the statements about believe women.
@RealCandaceO Either way it turns out I happy. If the man did it he will not be on the court. If she is lying I hope she gets sued for everything she got.
@RealCandaceO Don't you have faith in the American justice system to prove a falsely accused man is innocent? Why so worried? This woman could face a major lawsuit if he is found innocent. She cannot substantiate her claim in that event. Her life could be ruined even worse than the  his life.
@RealCandaceO I don't see what this has to do with radical feminism. Someone that was sexually assaulted has the right under the law to press charges. We are a country of laws not men. Isn't that a quote that Republicans like to say?
@softsadsatan I just think it is that one woman who is doing this to other people. I don't think that all white women who are feminist agree with the action she took here so it can't really be true of all white women who are feminists. Calling it white feminism is brining race into it.
@MizzGeeee @Cruellaisdevine @brycetache LOL! Now apply what you just said to me to a man saying it to a woman. Why did she allow it to happen? LOL! It is so ironic that you would say something like that.
@MizzGeeee @Cruellaisdevine @brycetache Calling or inferring someone is mentally challenged is not an appropriate way to behave. It is offensive and rude. 		The definition of objectification is universal you don't get to change it to fit your points. 		All objects are not degraded.
@RealCandaceO Good thing they are doing a FBI investigation to find out if those allegations are false.		Oh by the way if the FBI finds they are not false your allegations are false. Therefore if that does occur you can look in the mirror with the same disgust.
@MizzGeeee @Cruellaisdevine @brycetache So women don't ever treat a man like he is just a piece of meat. I feel your views are highly sexist and stereotypical. They generalize women as being a prototypical being that only has certain characteristics. Every woman is different. You don't speak for all of them.
@MizzGeeee @Cruellaisdevine @brycetache Flat tire, need a ride, need some money, help fixing something that broke, need something heavy lifted, need a battery jumped, etc etc.
@MizzGeeee @Cruellaisdevine @brycetache Besides your answer just admits some women like to be objectified. You just put it in a different way.
@MizzGeeee @Cruellaisdevine @brycetache Is it ok to merely treat a man as a tool to fix their current problem?
@MizzGeeee @Cruellaisdevine @brycetache What about female models on Instagram that objectify themselves? Is this considered objectification?
@brycetache @SharedMotivati1 In your picture you have a sign that says resist. How is resisting, respecting?
@DevCleary Do you mean nuclear weapons?
@BuckSexton @GlenWoodfin That is kind of ironic because you already live in a country like that. There are people that spend years in prison and have their lives ruined by a mere allegation.		https://t.co/bdONAd7qfN		https://t.co/qy2i2uD7OA		https://t.co/kFtYFlb7Ij		Just some examples.
@gwechsler @lisamurkowski I heard the next guy has even more extreme views on abortion.
@ForbardStory Hey chief I think he means that it happened so long ago. Happy to get you up to speed.
@jhjulian1956 @LifeNewsHQ @TrotAlex Peace is one of those words often said but rarely understood.
@LifeNewsHQ Same old same old.
@JedRecord The same can be said for anger and sadness.
@AdrienneLaw Yeah that is a false statement as he was a judge on a court and has been that way for years.
@Alyssa_Milano @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @SenHydeSmith Hi I demand to talk to you even though I don't know you and am not from your area.
@Hell_HasCome @FoxBusiness @POTUS Beware people that don't tweet under their real name.
@CNNMoney Yeah that is really true. There is no politics played at the Fed. People just talk today to say something no matter if it is true. Just print some more free money. Do another round of quantitative easing.
@markets Yeah stocks were doing just fine until 2008 as well.
@business I don't really see it as historic. If this guy isn't confirmed they confirm another. Not really going to shape the court either. Very misleading tweet.
@hrkbenowen Hope she wins.
@TedReimann @BBCWorld Yeah you did as you said it will always be a moral crime to you.
@TedReimann @spidermanh2 @BBCWorld That is great good for you.
@spidermanh2 @TedReimann @BBCWorld Your logic is flawed I would say have a good day but I really don't care what you have.
@spidermanh2 @TedReimann @BBCWorld I didn't give an article trying to give proof that wives are property. You have a problem with reading comprehension. Don't really want to argue with you because you can't even understand short tweets.
@TedReimann @BBCWorld Not really interested in why you think you are morally superior to others because of your values.
@TedReimann @BBCWorld I don't really care about your old time values that are not relevant to the new time. 12:00 is not 1:00 and the past is not the present.
@TedReimann @BBCWorld I am a bible basher? I merely stated a fact of what its existence says and you objected.  As for telling me to keep my so called fairytales to myself, don't tell me what to do as you are not in charge of me and I am not your property.
@AntonioParis Why does it even matter what you do there is only 30 days left to live?
@spidermanh2 @TedReimann @BBCWorld LOL! We are under the New Testament. Who jewish people, muslims, hindu, buddhists, atheists, and other people who are not christian? I didn't even realize it was above us.
@spidermanh2 @TedReimann @BBCWorld What? We are under the New Testament? Who is we? You have a problem with reading comprehension as evidenced by your tweet that completely misconstrued what I said.
@TedReimann @BBCWorld Sorry boss but you didn't hear what I said. 		https://t.co/PEsyqfjQZ9
@TedReimann @BBCWorld Maybe to the partner who cheated there is a bigger moral crime.
@bill_steinie3 @CNN Who cares if the rich break the laws? The government can just fine them and continue to allow them to operate as such.
@much_thought @jpjanson @ThatGuyAkshay @meghamohan Anything that makes these people sad, upset, mad, or they disagree with allows them to slander you call you names, or make false accusations against you. In life they still expect that you treat them with dignity.
@TedReimann @BBCWorld I am confused as to how it is a moral crime. Could you explain that? Women are no longer considered property of men. Adultery when thought up by man assumed that they were.
@panmaltzim @BBCWorld @matigary @ZimMediaReview @ZBCNewsonline Is there no reason for it to be that way?
@Slate Goodbye and good riddance one less to worry about.
@jpjanson @ThatGuyAkshay @meghamohan I am looking for a way to report your false accusations of who I am but twitter doesn't provide one.
@jpjanson @ThatGuyAkshay @meghamohan People like you are annoying.
@nypost I read it is because she lied on her application about being a divorced mom and this tweet is misleading.
@garwoodgal @nypost Not really.
@ThatGuyAkshay @meghamohan @jpjanson I completely disagree it is not for a government to dictate to its citizens what they are allowed to say or not say.
@seattlepi Regulating free speech on the basis of opinion.
@cinddy_m @Alyssa_Milano @PiperPerabo @DebraMessing What do you think about men that lose their job, go to jail, or suffer some other loss because of false accusations?
@mohanlal_lisa Why?
@Persephone_Colo LOL! So you are saying that women with beautiful bodies are only good for a night. This is very offensive towards women with beautiful bodies. I am pretty sure this quote is wrong on so many levels.
@tiarala So you want to light people on fire that have a different opinion than you?
@takesonlife @Sue_Zee_Que4 @1helpamerica @TheRickyDavila @SFutorian You started with most men and most men includes men in the Senate. Nice try.
@SharedMotivati1 @TheRickyDavila Women in my life  have abused me more than men have.
@SharedMotivati1 @TheRickyDavila Women, including those who are victims of abuse, also abuse others. Just because she is a victim doesn't mean that there are no victims of her potential abuse. She may be lying which is an abuse of people's trust.
@SharedMotivati1 @TheRickyDavila When did I side with an abuser? Your constant mischaracterization of my character is borderline defamation.
@SharedMotivati1 @TheRickyDavila Now you are characterizing me as a horrible person that shouldn't be tolerated. You are now acting like an abuser.
@SharedMotivati1 @TheRickyDavila But a person should be able to yell and belittle everyone else because she was an alleged victim of sexual abuse. Her claim is only with her abuser not with anyone else.
@SharedMotivati1 @TheRickyDavila Again, what generalization did I make? Now you are making false accusations against me. Saying what I said is not a generalization.		You are not all people. You can speak for yourself and the people you spoke to. You can not speak for all people that have encountered this.
@dilipkhandelwa I agree that inclusion is a good thing. Getting various inputs from different cultures gives a much wider perspective on the world and the world's issues.
@TalbertSwan This is an abusive comment because you are trying to force people to feel a certain way by claiming that they have no soul if they don't fell that way.
@JedRecord Be impressed by what you choose to be impressed by.
@johnpavlovitz Actual rape is terrible. Accusing someone of rape when it isn't actual rape can be even more terrible.
@SharedMotivati1 @TheRickyDavila Some states don't have a statute of limitations.  You still need enough proof to convict. A mere allegation is not enough.		How can you know how long the pain lasts for each individual person? Again this is you making a generalization about all victims everywhere.
@SharedMotivati1 @TheRickyDavila To be honest if that really happened to her I feel bad that it happened. If she is lying I feel bad for all the people who listened to her and believed her. The person that is fooled by the liar is the victim. Have you no sympathy for the victims of a liar?
@SharedMotivati1 @TheRickyDavila You just made generalizations about what I feel for victims. You don't know how I feel or don't feel. This is a form of abuse. You are creating a character of me that doesn't exist and trying to convince me and anyone that reads this tweet I am that character.
@ARmastrangelo @GlenWoodfin Just because you don't believe her doesn't mean she is not telling the truth.
@takesonlife @Sue_Zee_Que4 @1helpamerica @TheRickyDavila @SFutorian You and Trump really like to generalize and stereotype. Trump thinks most Mexicans are rapists and you think most men are rapists. If we follow this logic you think most Mexican men are rapists. Therefore you agree with Trump and just don't realize it.
@GlenWoodfin Isn't this what Trump does?
@ARmastrangelo @GlenWoodfin I don't believe either Kavananaugh or Ford.
@TheRickyDavila @SharedMotivati1 Sorry but crying to try to manipulate someone into getting your way is a form of abuse. Raising you voice and demanding that you get your way is abuse also.
@TheRickyDavila @SharedMotivati1 If you were raped you report the rape to the police when the rape occurred. The police investigate. If there is enough evidence the person is convicted and sent to prison or various other punishments. There is a statute of limitations on rape and sexual assault.
@GovMikeHuckabee You are a fraud you still call yourself a governor when you are not.
@GovMikeHuckabee Yeah and you change the law to whatever you want.
@grantstern I am just curious to know what your thoughts are on the 2008 financial crisis, the bailouts, and quantitative easing? Free money to those who print free money.
@LeftRight_Silky LOL! I guess the world has been perishing since it started because we never really all get along.
@DesmondDreckett It didn't look like the shark needed to be rescued.
@danieljpeter Could you explain what big impact occurred here?
@SenWhitehouse You call something that is alleged to have happened 32 years ago credible? The man has obviously changed and is not a high school student anymore. You are a joke.
@TheGandhiGuy30 @pauldunphy Oh you are so much of a better person than me. So much of a better person than me that I must sit and listen to you talk. Your advice is the correct advice and mine is incorrect.
@zylx5374 You just tweeted what someone else said and didn't even give your thoughts on it.
@joziuh @MericaIsSoGreat What is it that you are doing? Oh yeah disagreeing with a children's book. Advice is really good from people who actually practice it and not those who don't.
@CharlieYoungEsq The dangers of calling a black woman a name.		https://t.co/qdMmlM3Ahy
@devfromthecity I think he was just singing one of Jay-Z's songs.
@devfromthecity You mean like the black woman who just shot and killed three people yesterday?		https://t.co/cG6zLVGgBH
@joziuh @MericaIsSoGreat It is really a shame they shut down all the mental hospitals.
@NiceHoney4 @joziuh This is relevant to a woman shooting a man?
@ProfHerb @joziuh Do you still question it?
@joziuh It was a cartoon made for kids. Bears are not considered people so the law doesn't apply to them.
@TheGandhiGuy30 @pauldunphy The progress made by the Koreas is made by constant threat of war. The people have no say over the peace.
@TheGandhiGuy30 @pauldunphy If you hold no anger towards past injustices everyone will always be allowed to commit injustice towards you.
@johnpavlovitz Just because someone disagrees with you it doesn't make them a troll. Now you called me a troll don't act like you are a nice person.
@johnpavlovitz Wow! You told a guy you look tired.  Actually for a guy that is always telling people to act positively and act nicely, what you said wasn't too nice.
@MangledMichael The Sun was meant to rise in the East and set in the West but like many things the Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional and now it is known the sun must rise in the West and set in the East. 		Since nature has to follow the laws of man the Sun must comply.
@TheGandhiGuy30 @pauldunphy How mamy times are you allowed to screw other people over and still ask for peace?
@officialbarnsey @pauldunphy So calling people trolls and haters is talking nicely and being nice? Did you ever once stop to think that you do things or say things that are deserving of other people's anger? Today's world is full of people that are vain and really feel like that make no mistakes.
@pauldunphy You really think that people are going to talk nicely and be nice after all the stuff that happened yesterday and all the days before yesterday. You may feel like you are a person that treats everyone nicely all the time but believe me you don't.
@DebbieatEMA You don't need Twitter that doesn't stop you from using it.
@AmandaK_B I don't really think this is true of all cases.
@vickileeoap A man's biggest mistake is dating a woman with that mindset.
@Debra_Forever I can't wait for the next chapter in the 50 Shades movies. The rumor is she wants a divorce and accuses him of sexual assault. #metoo
@chitraaum Fathers have to think three times once for themself, once for their wife, and once for their child. It seems that fathers have to think more than mothers because in your quote you neglected to think about your own husband.
@dhanelachambal @pankhuripathak Seems like she thinks she is better than everyone else.
@pankhuripathak And you don't contribute to any of the negativity or the ill-will. Sorry if I find that hard to believe.
@AkieM__ In all seriousness, what are they doing?
@PerpetualSunsh1 Said he wanted chicken he was tired of the same old same old.
@300BlockVillage @DontTreadOnMe63 @TalbertSwan You are the one who is thinking about it.
@300BlockVillage @DontTreadOnMe63 @TalbertSwan Bro your shoelaces are untied.
@KamalaHarris Thanks for wasting the taxpayers money.
@guardian I thought what happened in the bedroom stayed in the bedroom. Men are such pigs for talking about their sexual escapades. Here read Stormy Daniels book on her sexual escapades.
@300BlockVillage @DontTreadOnMe63 @TalbertSwan Mind your own business off of Twitter. Everyone can see what you tweet on here.
@300BlockVillage @DontTreadOnMe63 @TalbertSwan There are literally little girls that throw less of a temper tantrum than you do. Bro in your mind you are right in reality you couldn't be further from the truth.
@300BlockVillage @DontTreadOnMe63 @TalbertSwan LOL! Why did you get so angry? Man you think you are the ultimate arbiter of truth. You have no proof to what you say but yet you say it. I encounter fools like you on a daily basis. I don't sweat people like you.
@chicagotribune I thought the same thing. Maybe the guy was in hurry or is in tough times.
@PerpetualSunsh1 Her husband said he wanted to eat out for dinner, maybe?
@Cheesepuff2009 When one is blind to their own action or lacks self-awareness they don't even realize that it is they who put themself there.
@betimelyss It is too hard to read a sign like that when you are speeding past in your BMW.
@A_AMilne In John 3:8 it says:		"The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes."
@RainbowSweety22 You are a person in this world. Your quote is silly. There are many good people in this world that it is good to compare yourself to.
@300BlockVillage @DontTreadOnMe63 @TalbertSwan He continues to say it. Why is this man not allowed to read the tweet and have a view on it? I am not sure why you thought your thought was intellectual, valid, or informative at all.
@FarleyDavenport @DontTreadOnMe63 @TalbertSwan You can't be serious.
@DontTreadOnMe63 @TalbertSwan It is amazing that the NAACP or the anti- defamation league doesn't say anything or do anything about this guy.
@TalbertSwan You really think using a hashtag OldWhiteMen and trying to stereotype them all into people that believe in the things you posted in your tweet is not racism or xenophobia? There are black people I encounter on a daily basis that are the things you mentioned in your tweet.
@TalbertSwan LOL! Man the very fact you have any followers shows how dumb people really are.
@johnlundin They will just appoint another Republican nominee. You think that people that are lifetime Republicans are going to change their vote over this?
@Llittlelady12 LOL! Water has always gone down hill. Clouds have always been in the sky. The grass was always green.
@MariePepperFord I am not sure why you bothered posting this on social media.
@MarisaKabas You are not a judge, member of the jury, police officer, or the victim. You don't know what did or did not happen.
@MarisaKabas I am not sure why you have a say at all what happens if this didn't happen to you.
@TurnNYCred I don't feel like it is a war. I feel like the left disagrees with some of the tactics used by the police.
@BuildingChamps But why?
@johnpavlovitz Why do you have to bring religion into a political argument?
@AhmedMu11127506 @Ahmedmusa718 @AlNassrFC_EN @AlNassrFC Situation: Your grandmother gets hit by a car.		Your Advice: Smile to let everyone know that you are stronger.		My Advice: Check to see if grandma is ok and call the ambulance if needed.
@dezelak Makes you sound like a cannibal when you call everyone cupcakes.
@dezelak They real question is did you just call everyone a cupcake?
@JPBrown5 If you repeat this everyday and your life doesn't change, does that mean you are a liar?
@JPBrown5 The Powerball isn't until Wednesday.
@greeneyedlucy84 They will try to raise taxes on the rest of the public for all the excessive spending they do.
@AhmedMu11127506 @Ahmedmusa718 @AlNassrFC_EN @AlNassrFC I understand that smiling shows that you are happy. It is not right for people to act however they want and try to hide their actions behind a smile. If you do something wrong you should not smile. If you smile when you do something wrong you show that you are happy about it.
@greeneyedlucy84 Our government is dysfunctional.
@jonjjohnn @Liberalnewspre1 @TalbertSwan No he/she is the only person without "sin".
@Liberalnewspre1 @TalbertSwan LOL! People are allowed to be proud of who they are? It is not targeting them based on their skin color. It is targeting them based on a variety of factors. Standing on the corner all day dressed like a person who fits the description of a drug dealer doesn't help much.
@katmc68 @_x0xbradx0x_ @LOLARAYNEATL @AP I don't get triggered. You are the one that is upset about the use of the word prostitute. I never saw anybody get so upset about the use of a word.
@Charmander_AMPC @katmc68 @_x0xbradx0x_ @LOLARAYNEATL @AP I never see any other country giving aid to America.
@TalbertSwan How about we remove the word black and just say a man?
@paulhodgkins3 You complain more than the average cat.
@BossLedZepLuvr @LOLARAYNEATL @AP Sarah save me your moral superiority because you are a woman bull shit. Women steal, kill, assault, lie, cheat, and break all of the same laws men do. Your opinion isn't even that moving it just shows how emotional you get when someone says something you don't like.
@BossLedZepLuvr @LOLARAYNEATL @AP I don't see why a prostitute shouldn't be called a prostitute. You are the one promoting ignorance by demanding that the article remove a fact.
@KnowGoGrow Ok but this doesn't mean they change it for the better.
@SigmaR3LLA @LOLARAYNEATL @AP No thank you. Telling someone to eat a dick is considered sexual harassment.
@Sk88queen @LOLARAYNEATL @AP That must be because you don't agree. A statement isn't crass just because you don't agree. Frankly your statement is void of any valid point and makes you look quite dumb.
@DonaldJesusTrum @BossLedZepLuvr @LOLARAYNEATL @AP How do you know it wasn't a woman? Women and men are considered the same today so the man is a woman and the woman is a man.
@_x0xbradx0x_ @katmc68 @LOLARAYNEATL @AP I understand your point bro. This is what many white people said about African slaves in the past and currently. Women don't give a shit about a man's problems. They are a selfish bunch.
@katmc68 @_x0xbradx0x_ @LOLARAYNEATL @AP https://t.co/ifn244srT9
@katmc68 @_x0xbradx0x_ @LOLARAYNEATL @AP Since you feel the need to try to make me look wrong I will successfully make you look wrong.		https://t.co/tykjb4aM0r		There are women who enter the trade on their on accord. In some places it is legal.
@katmc68 @LOLARAYNEATL @AP Frankly women like you get tiring because you always want to portray yourselves as victims and men as victimizers. You really think women do no wrong or do nothing illegal? In this case the women were victims of that one man. In other cases men are victims of women.
@katmc68 @LOLARAYNEATL @AP The #1 reason why women choose to enter the trade is the amount of money they can make.
@katmc68 @LOLARAYNEATL @AP Why do women like to start with um? The word doesn't make your point valid or sound smarter.  There are some women who are forced into prostitution but others do it on their own accord.		He is an article describing why women CHOOSE to enter the trade.		https://t.co/sQxT93GrVZ
@LOLARAYNEATL @AP Yeah I don't think the word should be taken out. The use of that word makes other women more careful about their choice of career. It also gives them more awareness of the dangers. I don't think that they are looked on as less of a person. Some people might but that is on them.
@peanut3656 @AP If it was a citizen the guy's mug shot would be all over the news.
@AP How come Trump doesn't want to deport all border patrol agents now?
@JedRecord I have thick skin I forgot how to feel at age 16.
@JoelDaniels @MoonNachos @PageSix I think your twitter name pretty much sums you up.
@MoonNachos @JoelDaniels @PageSix I can feel any way I want about it and so can you. That is the way I feel about it. Quit trying to replace my thoughts with your own.
@N8D351GN You don't seem smart.
@jenevieve_smith @PattyMurray People should also have free time to think creatively and pursue hobbies. We should not have such a large disparity between rich and poor. Capitalism is a failure to the vast majority of people but a success to a few. The rich get richer while the poor struggle.
@jenevieve_smith @PattyMurray Work should be structured so that people can have a life and work into old age. Pensions should not exist at all. When people are young both men and women they should have to do manual labor while being trained in another field to do when they get older.
@jenevieve_smith @PattyMurray Most people in the private industry do not have pensions. Pensions in government are funded by people in the private sector. Why should people without pensions have to fund other people's pensions? Taxes are much too high at this point to begin with.
@jenevieve_smith @PattyMurray People like you continually advocate for the control of other people. You demand that companies hire women and pay them more against their own will. You are a militant but deny that fact. You pretend that you are both man and lady depending on the situation.
@jenevieve_smith @PattyMurray Since they for the most part apply for clerical and office jobs men are pushed out of these jobs into harder labor. If we want equality there should be 50/50 Men and women in construction as well as clerical. In this case we a controlling what jobs people have to take.
@jenevieve_smith @PattyMurray Men work more physical jobs then women. The pay in the physical jobs is higher due to the tougher demands. Women routinely apply for jobs in clerical and other office settings. It is not fair that women only apply for the easy jobs. I think women should have to start hard jobs.
@DontReeOnMe @jenevieve_smith @PattyMurray If employers were only going to hire the lowest paid worker they would outsource all of our jobs to foreign countries. Corporations showed no loyalty to America as soon as they could get cheaper labor elsewhere. I think we should really start looking at the actions of companies.
@DontReeOnMe @jenevieve_smith @PattyMurray Not necessarily. If you are an employer and you only hire the people that you can pay the least you aren't necessarily hiring the most qualified candidate. In a competitive environment you must hire the most qualified not the one you pay the least.
@JoelDaniels @N8D351GN @PageSix Stop responding to me then. Don't tell me what to do like your my dad or my boss.
@RonanFarrow Who cares what she alleged? What proof does she have?
@N8D351GN You should have stayed in school and then maybe you could understand as well.
@N8D351GN I don't know my direction you are the one who looks lost in your picture.
@RepBarbaraLee @RevJJackson @angela_rye It seems like your definition of diversity is more black and less white.
@RepBarbaraLee @RevJJackson @angela_rye Diversity?? There are no Asian, Hispanic, or Caucasian men in this picture. Also there are five women and one man in this picture. Three of the women and the one man are African American, the other two are Caucasian. Pardon me if I don't agree with your definition of diversity.
@PattyMurray This act is sexist towards men. I don't feel like you represent the male population. Maybe it is because they are always shopping and buying Gucci.
@N8D351GN I feel like I steered you in the right direction. Make sure to pay it forward.
@N8D351GN Now stay off the syzzurp kid.
@N8D351GN Don't play that game. I am old enough to know an attitude when I see it.
@N8D351GN Ok bro no need for the attitude I was just saying.
@N8D351GN I didn't answer that question in the affirmative. You should listen to Myles and not make assumptions.
@N8D351GN I wouldn't have said that. The only reason I did was you called me a beta-male.
@N8D351GN @JoelDaniels @PageSix Your a grown man and you still worship spider-man if anybody is a beta-male it is you.
@JoelDaniels @N8D351GN @PageSix Drinkin syzzurp.
@N8D351GN @JoelDaniels @PageSix Dude take your loss like a man and stop whining like a little girl.
@N8D351GN @JoelDaniels @PageSix Face it I won.
@N8D351GN @JoelDaniels @PageSix Bro just save me some syzzurp.
@MarkCCrowley While other people invent things that actually help the world, managers change their job title to trick employees into thinking they like them so they work for less pay than they are worth.
@JoelDaniels @N8D351GN @PageSix First round of cough syrup is on Ju$Dolla$.
@zeynep I just can't believe you actually work as a professor. What do you design and sell for a profit? What private company do you run? Oh, wait just another spoiled feminist that complains about everything.
@JoelDaniels @N8D351GN @PageSix If I wanted to hear you point I would have read "The Way of The Dullard".
@JoelDaniels @N8D351GN @PageSix This is a common form of attack on Twitter which I don't understand. What does the amount of followers you have, have to do with if you are right or wrong? You think because people listen to you, that you are right?
@JoelDaniels @MoonNachos @PageSix I  thought making generalizations and assumption was wrong. Come to think about it none of my cousins are inbred. You really aren't right about anything are you?
@JoelDaniels @MoonNachos @PageSix I thought he was a 31 year old man? I am thirty. I can't relate to the youth of America who is older than me. Your advice is worthless.
@WrestlinGifs Show more respect like Ric Flair does for the sacred institution of matrimony.
@PageSix Bow Wow bringing awareness to what 99.9992% of the world's population already knows.
@JoelDaniels @MoonNachos @PageSix That is strange I thought there was nothing wrong with 'the culture'. Why does Bow Wow need to bring awareness to a culture there is nothing wrong with?
@MoonNachos @JoelDaniels @PageSix Bow wow can do a new song "I don't have a cough no mo, oh shiziti i never did".		Cough cough.	Drink it up, drink it up.	Jus wanna let y'all know.	I don't drink the syrup no mo.	This is fo sho, bro.	It be a real problem yo.	Cough cough.	I don't drink it no mo.
@MoonNachos @JoelDaniels @PageSix Seems like the only people that have a problem with this are rappers. Based on how many of them wrote songs about the purple stuff and glorifying it to their listeners.
@MoonNachos @JoelDaniels @PageSix Yeah that is pretty much the moral of the story.   Oh sorry, I will use much better language like your idol rappers do in their songs. How dare I criticize Bow Wow. I forgot we live in a society where rappers are considered royalty and above reproach.
@JoelDaniels @MoonNachos @PageSix Bring awareness?  There is awareness on the side of the bottle of cough syrup. There is probably numerous articles online about the dangers of drinking too much cough syrup.
@N8D351GN @JoelDaniels @PageSix You figure it out.
@foolonthehillz @IdaraVictor @serenawilliams It is a double standard that he doesn't make as much as Serena. I think Nike should put Ramos in the same ad with Keapernick. The amount or persuction Ramos has to endure is unheard of in modern times.  I think all referees should take a knee during Serena' s matches.
@foolonthehillz @IdaraVictor @serenawilliams All hail Umpire Ramos. This guy is my hero. We need more umpires like Ramos in tennis.
@JoelDaniels @MoonNachos @PageSix You know who deserves sympathy the man who was just robbed and left for dead by two teenagers. The guy has three kids and a wife. I feel sympathybfor him because he doesn't deserve that. This guy drank cough syrup on his own free will.
@JoelDaniels @MoonNachos @PageSix I am not the one drinking cough syrup here. Pardon me if I think that he brought his problem on himself and deserves no sympathy.
@JoelDaniels @N8D351GN @PageSix I didn't ask for your time and frankly I think you are wasting my time.
@N8D351GN @JoelDaniels @PageSix They put the recommended dosage on the side of the bottle and they also put the intended use. He did not take the recommended dosage or use it for its intended use.
@JedRecord How far do you have to get?
@MoonNachos @JoelDaniels @PageSix Myles you don't know me and you should check yourself before you say something. I don't think drinking cough syrup is cool, plain and simple. I made a joke but you and your lover decided to make it a big thing. Do me a favor a preach to someone that gives a damn.
@MoonNachos @JoelDaniels @PageSix Bro get a life. Don't really have time for your simple views of the world.
@JoelDaniels @PageSix You don't sound smart.
@Grunge_Girl7 I know apparently he was cute and hardcore at the same time.
@JoelDaniels @PageSix This some straight gangsta stuff right here. Drinkin cough syrup when yoi don't have a cough. This is smart yeah boy.
@JoelDaniels @PageSix Your idol drank cough syrup as a hobby so it doesn't mean much coming from you.
@MsTineo @PageSix This really seems like one of the more pressing issues of our time.
@ravenlifetil @PageSix @RealDLHughley Bro, chill, give it time.
@PageSix Maybe if he spent more time in school he could have just read the directions on the side of the bottle. These rappers in the game today all about the money. Bro, my advice stay in school learn how to read and don't be like Bow Wow.
@PageSix I didn't realize that they considered him a rapper.
@GymCoachMac The Dalai Lama is just a man saying words.
@JMooreBoston Wasn't that speech great?
@johnlundin He needs to play more golf to catch up with Obama and Bush.
@JHorn92752078 @ChrisJZullo What does Trump have the magical ability to control people's hands and eyes? These people that he keeps uneducated and dumb don't know how to pick up books and read them. Trump forced them to be late and tardy for class. He put the joint in their hand when they skipped school.
@ChrisJZullo @LinusMinkev Why would anyone give a no interest loan? So the students are going to college to learn so they can get a higher paying job and profit but the banks shouldn't be able to profit. 		What do you think of the students who go to school to become loan officers and work for banks?
@ChrisJZullo @LinusMinkev Information is free and you don't have to go to college to get it.
@grogandgrub01 @bawdzisnaughty It is considered racist in our country to force an immigrant to learn English. English is not the national language and people are free to speak what they please. What size hood do you wear?
@grogandgrub01 @bawdzisnaughty Most of your liberal heros can't even speak properly let alone write properly, but yet there you are holding me to a different standard then you hold your own.
@grogandgrub01 @bawdzisnaughty On this platform you are given so many characters to make a point. People like you are annoying because you want me to proofread re-read and perfect a short statement. All people like you do is discredit people on the basis of spelling, grammar and call them names.
@Ytse_Ham @CBSEveningNews @jeffglor @Jerickaduncan They have no shame so they don't care if they are right or wrong.
@grogandgrub01 @bawdzisnaughty You wear the hood.
@grogandgrub01 @bawdzisnaughty LOL. My hood, I can choose to dislike and like who I choose just like you. I have never wore a 'hood' and unlike you the people I dislike, I dislike for a reason grounded in fact. You just spew your hate and accuse other people of being things before you even know.
@Rwind_13 @MynLavi @xo_Juliet_Hana @zara_xoxx @Rabiabasri21 @playmaker_004 @Smriti_uma @uthra_ajay @Veenahealer @speedster1857 @virus_rajesh If arrnd is introverted don't ask him to open up. If he is extroverted don't tell him to shut up. Apparently telling people what to do is rude and arrnd would never do that.
@awasthis Ok I am thankful for what I have. Please make the check payable to Johnathan.
@Tshi_Nakanyane You are full of doubt, lack faith in promise, and limit yourself and this is just one thing about you even though it is three.
@RealTimBlack @DebraMessing @SusanSarandon Depicting yourself as Asian can be consodered racist.
@RealTimBlack @DebraMessing @SusanSarandon Whenever I read Tim Black' s tweets slamming people I wonder was he this stupid in the 90's or did the internet just make his stupidity more visible? I don't have to wonder for long.
@DerronEShort Derron speculates, assumes, and gossips and will not pick up the phone and check on you. He will make you cry.
@grogandgrub01 @bawdzisnaughty Not what he said. That is what you thought. I agree you are a fool.
@bawdzisnaughty They all need to be called a racist like he was. Why is he treated differently? It isn't fair such double standards. All cartoonists should boycott until these cartoonists are called racists.
@KarenCivil Actually men that like to wear lingerie were not included.
@whiteloser80 @theravenmonroe @docklandsnate @Richard_Carroll They are trying to dehumanize him by making him look like a chipmunk.
@whiteloser80 @theravenmonroe @docklandsnate @Richard_Carroll 100%. His hair is not that blonde and his chin is not that big in real life. The cartoon should look exactly like him and not be funny at all.
@theravenmonroe @docklandsnate @Richard_Carroll Your tweet bothers me and I think you should remove it.
@foley_axle @barbaricus @charliewagwag @Richard_Carroll So if a cartoon was made depicting the umpire as a dunce it would also be racist. This is your logic. Any cartoon depicting someone with exaggerated features is racist. Excuse me if I think you are wrong.
@foley_axle @barbaricus @charliewagwag @Richard_Carroll The "public" is not only ripping them it is also laughing with them.
@foley_axle @charliewagwag @Richard_Carroll I hope the guy sues you for defamation.
@Richard_Carroll @charliewagwag Man these people that think their opinion is fact are really starting to get annoying.
@Richard_Carroll You think it is racist. Other people do not. You are not the be all and end all.
@Richard_Carroll @kbevs95 You give it a rest. People are tired of you acting like you are the moral authority of what should and should not be said.
@martins_f8 @alwaystheself Glad you got that straight. Otherwise they were going to call you a racist and a sexist.
@wiselatinaphd @alwaystheself Oh yeah and also the sport you are tweeting about.
@wiselatinaphd @alwaystheself You mean the same perverted logic that gave rise to the country you live in, the platform you are tweeting on, the college you studied at and the college you teach at.
@lldiedrich @alwaystheself Not suprised that an article with such a simple main idea confused you.
@bionicbritt86 @Nuno_Borges @alwaystheself Not really no thanks.
@Nuno_Borges @alwaystheself OMG! You actually make sense and are accurate. There is a little bit of hope in this thread.
@RavenclawSoc23 @alwaystheself Basically you are like wrong.
@alwaystheself Boycott baby boycott. Hell yes this is good for tennis. We need to reestablish R E S P E C T in the game.
@foolonthehillz @IdaraVictor @serenawilliams Nice point. Serena is one of the highest paid tennis players of all time.
@TheCriticalthi1 @IdaraVictor @serenawilliams No matter how many facts and evidence you present they will still disagree.
@IdaraVictor @serenawilliams I don't see it.
@kathygriffin I don't think it is a double standard. I think your statement is an exaggeration of the truth as well. I am sure there are other reasons.
@troycoverdale @Bodkin617 @CBSEveningNews @CarleyShimkus @jeffglor @Jerickaduncan LOL! And the new power brokers are going to treat everyone fairly. Give me a break if I don't believe your bull shit.
@troycoverdale @Bodkin617 @CBSEveningNews @CarleyShimkus @jeffglor @Jerickaduncan He said if the statements were false not if he didn't agree. Liar.
@Ytse_Ham @CBSEveningNews @jeffglor @Jerickaduncan I agree. Hanging out with co-workers is a big no no.
@furry_bonz @ajplus She doesn't.
@ajplus Did you really just compare a hurricane to Mike Tyson's punch?
@MMitongu @everybodyzzmama @mollylyons @Estee416 @Grammitude55 You keep making miscaracterizations of my character and I will sue you.
@MMitongu @Estee416 @mollylyons @everybodyzzmama @Grammitude55 That is actually defamation and I could sue you.
@MMitongu @mollylyons @Estee416 @everybodyzzmama @Grammitude55 LOL! Christian?? Maybe in the Twilight Zone.
@MMitongu @mollylyons @Estee416 @everybodyzzmama @Grammitude55 There is no point in even arguing with you.
@MFLO_0099 @ElizabethGChang Ok.
@MFLO_0099 @ElizabethGChang I am glad you think so, but once again refer to my original comment.
@MFLO_0099 @ElizabethGChang Besides I think your profile description of yourself pretty much sums you up.
@MFLO_0099 @ElizabethGChang I would say that was clever but that would be a lie.
@JakeGiddes @Tim_Lill @ElizabethGChang That is completely unfair that they would dock her a point for that. She has such class and elegance and only wants to teach her daughter the same class.
@BethanyRDuber @ElizabethGChang Can you imagine if there was a female RB that tried to run past the d-line and linebackers?
@Tim_Lill @ElizabethGChang How dare you post facts here. We were busy being emotional.
@dunnotholetssee @ElizabethGChang You could play the racism or mysoginist card as well. The white male privilege card works in this situation as well. She got treated worse than Jackie Robinson. That poor thing.
@adater @ElizabethGChang Do research? Why do research when you can just be emotional?
@MFLO_0099 @ElizabethGChang Yeah she was singled out in your opinion. In your world your opinion is the best in the real world it is really quite wrong.
@ElizabethGChang Joker. Go cry a river.
@Estee416 @Grammitude55 @mollylyons @MMitongu @everybodyzzmama Your narrative is so false it is comedic. You and people like you are frauds.
@Estee416 @Grammitude55 @mollylyons @MMitongu @everybodyzzmama LOL! You should get your delusions checked out by a doctor. The government just gives out money to female led construction companies and companies that hire so many women.		https://t.co/04GOhZ8Ejc
@Estee416 @mollylyons @MMitongu @everybodyzzmama @Grammitude55 I wasn't even talking to you when I said that. There are going to be some buildings falling apart in your future.
@mollylyons @MMitongu @Estee416 @everybodyzzmama @Grammitude55 Who cares what you think I should do? I don't think your opinion is valuable at all. You probably can't even make a sandwich.
@Estee416 @Grammitude55 @mollylyons @MMitongu @everybodyzzmama That is really hard to do with affirmative action. Give yourself a big pat on the back.
@mollylyons @MMitongu @Estee416 @everybodyzzmama @Grammitude55 Since you called me it, it must be true because you are a lying feminist.
@mollylyons @MMitongu @Estee416 @everybodyzzmama @Grammitude55 Oh great another genius theatre major. Was math and science too hard for you? Was the evil white man preventing you from doing that? You poor victim.		Go practice your mental illness somewhere else it is not healthy to spread it on twitter.
@EMWpeace @millionairedot What is this something you are trying to achieve?
@millionairedot Like the lottery?
@MMitongu @Estee416 @everybodyzzmama @Grammitude55 @mollylyons LOL! Wow don't say anything offensive it is not presidential, but fuck everybody.
@Soapbox_Atheist It is an interesting thought.
@ChatByCC The economy is not booming.
@Soapbox_Atheist Yep. They block you out if you say something that doesn't fit that truth as well.
@BjayzusBob @paulhodgkins3 @19MW98 I would expect exactly what exists.
@paulhodgkins3 Sounds about right. They really make it better for us don't they?
@larrykim Wow that equation doesn't consist of anything but psychology and success. What about time management, hard work, showing up, networking, money management, etc etc?
@davidbohanna @smcardle45 @thetribunechd She just blocked me. I don't understand why liberals think people should have to help them. They act however they want and block or disassociate people and expect the same people they disassociate with to help them.
@smcardle45 @A_ModernPatriot @thetribunechd Makes me hate unions.
@Sachmosam @smcardle45 @thetribunechd It is their bigoted nature. Only their opinion is correct. There can be no other opinion but the liberals. Now let us go stand in the street.
@smcardle45 @A_ModernPatriot @thetribunechd I am scared for our kids.
@smcardle45 @Elanabanana777 @thetribunechd And you are the one who says it is racist. What is your point?
@plee999 @smcardle45 @thetribunechd Be careful she may grace you with one of her one word answers.
@JustTammy29 @smcardle45 @thetribunechd I agree whole heartedly.
@smcardle45 @thetribunechd Bigot troll.
@smcardle45 @davidbohanna @thetribunechd LOL! The bigot doesn't agree so she blocks you.
@CullenMcDougall @smcardle45 @thetribunechd I agree the real racism is that a white male person is not free to express their speech but all others are.
@thetribunechd He can't be a racist or sexist he has a daughter now apologize.
@ccclight62 @MAGADROP @yolowaccordsmom No that is what Obama said when people didn't like him.
@BarackObama Wasn't that act of terror done by Radical Islamic terrorists?
@HuffPostPol So what? People get tattoos on their forehead over a bet.
@ccclight62 @MAGADROP @yolowaccordsmom If you don't like the leader why don't you just leave.
@ccclight62 @MAGADROP @yolowaccordsmom How dare you say all, you have to be accurate when you talk. Meanwhile they call anyone they don't like racist or sexist regardless of what the truth is.
@yolowaccordsmom FYI I was raised a democrat by two teachers in the inner city schools. It is just that the way the party is going is not for me. I didn't vote for Trump and I don't really agree with the right either.  I am not a fan of group-think.
@kolikole37 @Johnbru89 He is one of those people that suck up and kiss ass.
@Johnbru89 More like it is copying the movie that just came out with the puppets. She is pretty much talking about sex to kids. Most grown men don't watch puppets except for the liberal man children.
@Slate My conversation will reflect whatever I want it to reflect and I don't need you to tell me how to think or speak.
@tanyia That is too funny because a guy made fun of my spelling of one word for two days but here are all of these people tweeting a misspelling or a typo as if it is correct.
@girlsreallyrule I don't understand why people say this is a funny tweet. I feel there is a double standatd here because if other people would make a joke about a hurricane that is about to hit the mainland they would demand they lose their job and be censored.
@elayne11261 @yolowaccordsmom The liberals love THEIR heros regardless of what they say or do. They always know it is for the good.
@over_civilized @yolowaccordsmom Liberals are not capable of hate. (Sarcasm)
@MAGADROP @yolowaccordsmom That is really what they do, whine, complain, and protest.
@mdavisqlder @washingtonpost Your statement is 100% false.
@IdiotusGigantus @africatechie @Knightcartoons @theheraldsun @usopen Erase it now or I will throw a temper tantrum.
@ernasheree @africatechie @Knightcartoons @theheraldsun @usopen A cartoonist is free to make a cartoon and does not need your approval to do so.
@DiogenesLamp0 @africatechie @InWordsDrown_I @Knightcartoons @theheraldsun @usopen You concocted the motives of the person that created the comic to fit your agenda of calling anyone racist that does something you don't like.
@FunniestVidsOSN @africatechie @InWordsDrown_I @Knightcartoons @theheraldsun @usopen I don't get how this is a race thing either.
@africatechie @Knightcartoons @theheraldsun @usopen LOL. This is offensive but the way she acted was ok. Give me a break.
@BillieJeanKing @SharedMotivati1 @serenawilliams It is such a double standard that women get to play other women and men have to play men. It is a double standard that men wear shorts and women wear skirts. It is a double standard that men are considered more violent than women. Stick to hitting balls with a racket genius.
@iluvATLtraffic @FrightBatFatale @BigSerenaVeeFan @BillieJeanKing @serenawilliams Men do get penalized. A penalty is not always called and is up to the referee. Serena gets away with things that should have been a penalty as well.		Your point is false.
@FrightBatFatale @BigSerenaVeeFan @BillieJeanKing @serenawilliams You can't explain rational things to emotional people.
@BillieJeanKing @SharedMotivati1 @serenawilliams Double Standard are you crazy or something?
@Miamirealtygirl @SharedMotivati1 I love Mondays. I hope my Monday is very hard and challenging.
@BDwmad If I wrote a book on fallacies would it be considered knowledge? When I say fallacies I mean everything in my book is completely untrue.
@KumariRukshmani Nice opinion of what a true leader is.
@JohnMcGrathMB Tell that to the people that are about to get hit by a hurricane.
@JohnMcGrathMB LOL. Life is simple? Sounds like you grew up with a silver spoon in your mouth. Tell that to the people who grow up in broken homes or with abusive parents. People like you crack me up.
@vipersnke @dcexaminer @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I really hope we hold all politicians to this standard going forward.
@QuitaQuita41 @JamilSmith Yep, don't politicize a hurricane and its potential damage yet here this guy and a few other people are. Not only that many are saying help will be given only to white people.
@rcktwit @JamilSmith Do you really think?
@marksund1 @JamilSmith @MPAVictoria Wow! How do you know that?
@edjlord3000 @jennyyangtv @oliviamunn There is no proof of what his current mentality is.
@edjlord3000 @jennyyangtv @oliviamunn In addition there are many women that are not in prison even though they have committed crimes.
@edjlord3000 @jennyyangtv @oliviamunn According to the article the man was a registered sex offender. This means he did not got away with whatever he did.		Also you said the man is a pedophile. Since whatever crime occurred in the past the use of the word "is" is not correct. Was is the proper word.
@edjlord3000 @jennyyangtv @oliviamunn I would say what you said is untrue. There are people in prison for sex crimes.
@daltonjoseph @annemariayritys They have a button for that.
@gatewaypundit If you are a Democrat it is ok to sell positions and hire people if they are your friends. All you have to do is act like you believe MLK Jr. and not really follow what he said.
@GlenWoodfin Sounds about right.
@AP_Politics I am not sure how he thinks he did anything productive at all.
@klazaroe @AP_Politics Them and all of their rules have really made the world a better place.
@wondermann5 She was the only one that decided it was necessary to get a guy removed from one scene in the movie. Did he sexually assault anyone on the film set? Is he currently a danger? She negatively effected that man's life and he did nothing to her.
@jennyyangtv @oliviamunn What was the conviction for? If he is still a danger to society and didn't learn his lesson why isn't he still in prison. I think Olivia Munn was wrong here because she brought up a past offense the man was punished for and punished him again.
@CravenRave @amaditalks @mookieman14 @jennyyangtv @oliviamunn How is it the same thing?
@amaditalks @mookieman14 @jennyyangtv @oliviamunn How long ago did he commit the crime? What was the crime? Why was it any of her business? She was not the victim. He served his time, otherwise he wouldn't be out of prison being able to seek gainful employment.
@girlsreallyrule What do you think the reason is that nothing matters any more?
@johnpavlovitz If God exists and made the life we live and Trump is the president in the life we live, I would say that something rather than nothing is true.
@BarackObama Will live in a Democratic Republic.
@Keats137 You just quoted the bible in vain.
@RealSkipBayless I am not even sure what you do for a living.
@GovMikeHuckabee @GlenWoodfin They did all of that without saying excuse me, how rude.
@Pink_About_it @GlenWoodfin Why does it even matter?
@CandaceCunnin12 I think after the 15th time a woman takes her pms out on them it becomes harder to forgive them.
@Lee74brownn @SteveDawson0972 Adam Grant says that you should give more than two options.
@ElFiguehube135 I work in a pencil factory. Don't you think that would be pretty dumb.
@Shoseki @AdamMGrant You forgot to carry the 1.
@mydeadbro Tried it, didn't work.
@iAbhishekkBJP So why do you keep pretending to be someone your not?
@AmeobaAtheist Jim Jefferies still couldn't follow it.
@Christi29136342 Wrong.
@tashapadgett123 Hey
@DougJ7777 Imagine if you lived in a place where you could park for free.
@SEEAutonomy Don't rich parents just hand a million dollars over to their kids? I am pretty sure that is how it worked with the Waltons. Don't you have somewhere to be? You shouldn't be trolling on Twitter all day.
@NoelVincent @AdamMGrant I don't agree. I believe everyone is a master of their own actions. If someone acts in the worst way it is not because someone brought it out in them it is because they brought it out of themselves.
@NoelVincent @AdamMGrant So he is making an assumption about people that according to his own tweet might say something about himself.
@03LAP23 You must hate your job.
@Arti_Omitsu Sounds like Alzheimer's disease.
@Tylersdaytoday I always carry a paper bag with me for these events. I just kindly ask them to put it on their head so I won't have to check them out without being incedibly obvious. They understand completely.
@Cakes_of_Pan Correction, hobgoblin should be gremlin.
@RokBaller Both Colin and Trump unify and divide. So by your statement they are both strong and weak.
@Williams_byanka I have been wondering all morning where the hell I am.
@SwampPump @FoxNews @FoxBusiness @foxandfriends @DiamondandSilk @d Bro just face it,  the end is near.
@SteveDawson0972 I think my wife is a terrorist.
@Lilovebananas76 You can't meditate away your wife.
@ValaAfshar This seems like it is your definition of lucky people and not really a true definition of them. 		Is everybody supposed to go down the list and check off the ones they are to determine if they are going to be lucky? Spare me the nonsense.
@ValaAfshar Why does a lucky person have to be hard working? Most people that want to win the Powerball don't want to work at all. Pardon me if I have to call bull shit.
@beingbrilliant I can't wait until Friday.
@NoelVincent @AdamMGrant His statement is like saying nothing anyway because of his use of the word might.		It is like me saying to someone that is planning a picnic, it might rain. What does that mean it might? It is not definitive. It might be the opposite.
@AdamMGrant People bring out in themselves whatever they want. I don't control your actions you do.		Maybe people think others are selfish and dishonest because that is what they observed other people being.
@harshsi73363978 How do you even know they say it behind your back?
@shekharchahal @IsraeliPolice @TarekFatah The video said they tried to enter the shrine to pray. Your post says something different. Someone isn''t telling the truth.
@harshsi73363978 Why is that what life is about? What does it mean to remain true? Why are you the center of this?
@cuteAvnii What if the bad situation gets worse?
@_Pete__Smith I have decided that engaging with you is a waste of time. It was fun at first but now it is more annoying.
@_Pete__Smith You are mighty annoying. What do you do check every word?
@jasminecainrock The person that thought of that saying must have spent a ton of time thinking about negativity. I mean how else do you know something like that?
@_Pete__Smith We all know who the imbecile is here. Part of the reason we can't have an intellectual conversation is because you can't get over that one word that was spelled wrong.
@_Pete__Smith How many words have I spelled right since that?
@_Pete__Smith You really are sore about that. I would suggest getting your girlfriend to kiss it but she is busy kissing me.
@MissADS08 Are you a magician?
@2morrowknight @BillGates Question: Should the government tax Bill Gates?
@iflymia Tell that to the people that read books.
@vols21joe Bill Russell is my hero.
@9_stafford_fan Fuck off.
@jeansergegagnon How would she know? I want to live at least 17 times.
@karynpalminteri That was something you had the right to say but probably should not have.
@JBHinOC I think that is a first. We are going to put it into the history books. You are a legend.
@_Pete__Smith You spelled it wrong more times than me. Is that like the 15th time you spelled it wrong.
@frenzy_meier @ValaAfshar The illiterate of the 21st century are the ones who cannot read and write. However surviving in the 21st century will more largely be dependent on being able to learn, unlearn, and relearn. If one does not have the ability to do these three things they can be like the illiterate.
@frenzy_meier @ValaAfshar I don't agree. They don't consider everyone an intellectual. His statement was not true or factual.
@frenzy_meier @ValaAfshar I will take a statement however I want. You cannot redefine a word that has a generally accepted definition to fit your own viewpoint. I don't agree with him and the statement wasn't that wise.
@DrDomCooper @ValaAfshar @JeffBoss9 Today it seems that just because someone in the past said a statement it has merit to some people. I feel the statement is wrong.
@ValaAfshar The definition of an intellectual is someone who writes and talks all day and expects to be paid.
@ValaAfshar That is interesting but have to disagree because the definition of illiterate is someone who can't read or write.
@innocent The liberals are teaching that in schools today.
@rileyp2013 @matthewprewett @PiperPerabo @womensmarch So if we are allowed to do everything back that others do to others can't I just do anything I want to you because there are people that have done everything imaginable?
@matthewprewett @PiperPerabo @womensmarch Some of the American people voted for Trump. By the way it is not a democracy it is a Democratic Republic. If it was a democracy Hillary Clinton would be president because she won the popular vote.
@PiperPerabo I can't believe you got arrestred for that. No wait yes I can. 		I think the same thing about RBG but I don't go screaming during government hearings.
@BenignoVito @AliceVantrease @LibertyBell1000 @BillOReilly People can choose their own values in America.
@lionorder18 @AliceVantrease @BillOReilly Can you believe Trump's brand would endorse a guy like that?
@lionorder18 @AliceVantrease @BillOReilly The people should endorse him to run the country.
@AlisaRKCBF @AliceVantrease @BillOReilly How do you work your ankles in the gym?
@_Pete__Smith I bet your spell checker corrects your spelling about 5 times for each tweet you make. You are probably going to obsess about that for a year.
@AliceVantrease @CakedaddyINTL @BillOReilly That really isn't targeted harrasment. Just because you don't like what he said and it is offensive does not make it harrasment. He probably has to constantly deal with people calling him names and other bull shit as well.
@CakedaddyINTL @AliceVantrease @BillOReilly It is pretty offensive what you said. Some of the people that buy Nikes can't afford them as they live in section 8 housing and are on food stamps or disability.
@BillOReilly @GlenWoodfin Bill don't you have some money to pay to a female for sexual harrasment?
@_Pete__Smith Look man, face the music, you lost. Quit being a spoiled sport and man up.
@_Pete__Smith Yeah boss, are you going to tell me how to use my constitutional rights? Either way speak or silent you are a fool.
@_Pete__Smith Are you still talking gibberish?
@YourFriendKav @Chamond3000 @tariqnasheed Why would I try to set the trend of something you tried? Just the very fact that you thought of that shows how your mind works. That is probably the best idea you thought you had in 10 years.
@YourFriendKav @Chamond3000 @tariqnasheed You have a small peanut for a brain. You prove my point by talking.
@Chamond3000 @YourFriendKav @tariqnasheed Peanut Butter
@YourFriendKav @Chamond3000 @tariqnasheed You are a wanksta.
@Chamond3000 @YourFriendKav @tariqnasheed You keep believing that boss. You are a legend in your own mind.
@_Pete__Smith You are so confused. I feel bad for you. I think I will start a GoFundMe so you can have a brain surgery to increase your IQ.
@_Pete__Smith P A I D. The more you talk the more you prove your moronic nature.
@YourFriendKav @Chamond3000 @tariqnasheed You are a bandwagon.
@_Pete__Smith I am not mad but you are delusional.
@_Pete__Smith Yeah I am the butter cup when people like you got sensitivity training implemented in government offices because people offend you. Dream on fucko.
@gopbangs By the way those aren't my panties they are your girlfriend's.
@_Pete__Smith Great another dumbass libtard that thinks that because someone disagrees with them they are a racist.		 You don't have any problem telling white people how to think. 		I think it is funny how you act like you never spelled anything wrong. Morons like you make me laugh.
@gopbangs What point is that?
@_Pete__Smith Colin got paid to be a quarterback not to protest. The teams did not want to endorse his message by letting him play for them. Colin is not a victim. He is a man who made a decision and must live with it. People should not be forced to agree with Colin or be forced to hire him.
@_Pete__Smith Oh you are right it should be paid thanks for proving you are nothing but a good speller.
@gopbangs It proves you are a moron.
@ChapSPeyton He was not fired. His contract was bought out and he was not resigned.
@ChapSPeyton He knelt during the National Anthem on Television while an NFL game was about to be played. He can express his viewpoint on his own time not when he is being paid by the team to represent them.
@Chamond3000 @tariqnasheed What is their reasoning?
@RainbowSweety22 A crazy person said this to me once.
@TomHall @bellue_paula Ok can we throw you in a cage with a lion as well?
@moodyjames_1 Your tweet doesn't make any sense.
@tariqnasheed I am not sure you are credible source of information. I am sure you are a credible source of mis-information.
@tariqnasheed Why is someone a white supremacist if they boycott nike?
@Abvthelaw @gregfuhrmann What do you mean?
@ChapSPeyton Colin got payed to be a quarterback not to protest. The teams did not want to endorse his message by letting him play for them. Colin is not a victim. He is a man who made a decision and must live with it. People should not be forced to agree with Colin or be forced to hire him.
@ChapSPeyton You disagreed with my statement. I didn't disagree with your statement.
@ChapSPeyton Colin is not a world champion. I don't know how you can disagree with that. Ali was a boxer, Colin was a quarterback. They played different sports. Boxing is not the same as football.
@SabrielClayr @poly_monkey @HarryMayUltd @ApfelStrudelll @GlenWoodfin @AshleeMPreston @bishopche3 Just another false accuser.
@tramlaw301 That is insensitive to the people protesting the protest.
@steveglenn @wardaallen @stackindegrees Hey Steve it does not need to be stated in the rules. He was not fired his contract was not renewed.
@ChapSPeyton Comparing Ali to Colin is like comparing the hot to the cold.
@WritingEleanor @Nike How does burning a pair of Nike shoes make you a racist?
@MelissaTy143 @Nike Nike will pay you a good price to make their sneakers.
@_Pete__Smith Your statement is a generalization made by an idiot.
@gregfuhrmann So let me get this straight police brutality is wrong but child labor is ok?
@PaulOfFame @Kaepernick7 @Nike I don't understand why he can be so negative. He is kneeling during the national anthem for one thing. Why can't he stand for all the good things and kneel on his own time?
@rashadrobinson Colin can protest. He just cannot protest on the field during the national anthem. The NFL has a business to run. Colin is bad for business.
@rashadrobinson If I talk about a sensitive subject in my uber I get a bad rating. If I get too many bad ratings I get deactivated from the service. Colin talked about a sensitive subject and was deactivated. Why should he be allowed to use a nationally televised event to promote his agenda?
@SabrielClayr @poly_monkey @HarryMayUltd @ApfelStrudelll @GlenWoodfin @AshleeMPreston @bishopche3 Good to know where you stand tough guy.
@78rider The moment becomes the past in a moment.
@stephanie_atkn Billions in the bank means you can pretty much go to the hospital and get any treatment you want.
@PoliScrutiny101 I don't understand why either one is relevant. I guess one can only listen to what they say and decide if it has any merit.
@stellsani @realDonaldTrump Federal workers getting a raise means we will have to pay more in taxes. I am not a federal worker and I have to find ways to actually make my money. I can't just go around collecting money from people with force.
@BrentRBrian @Microsoft @intel @AMD @Linux It is unfair that the young are handed a massive debt, trash, nuclear waste, etc and expected to fix someone else's problems.
@MrAdamKitchener If success was easy the children of rich people would inherit their wealth and also be succesful.
@78rider If you aren't defined by your past you can't be defined by your future. The future is the past yet to happen.
@SabrielClayr @HarryMayUltd @poly_monkey @ApfelStrudelll @GlenWoodfin @AshleeMPreston @bishopche3 Both hands now??? You definitely have pms don't deny it. You should apologize right now.
@SabrielClayr @HarryMayUltd @poly_monkey @ApfelStrudelll @GlenWoodfin @AshleeMPreston @bishopche3 I understand that you have pms and everything but that does not excuse your vile mouth.
@niccid72 Except if you are Trump then the liberals will force you to apologize by continually harrassing you until they get their way.
@BBHomeless @GlenWoodfin @AshleeMPreston That sounds like a threat. Are you going to accuse him of sexual assault now as well?
@Me75327714 @GlenWoodfin @AshleeMPreston You say the church. Which church? There are multiple pastors, bishops, etc and denominations.
@Peter_Bucci @GlenWoodfin @AshleeMPreston I liked it.
@biiiiiiiiina @GlenWoodfin @AshleeMPreston You need to recheck your eyes. You can't tell the difference between a breast and a side.
@kymera11 @realadamdewar @HarryMayUltd @poly_monkey @ApfelStrudelll @GlenWoodfin @AshleeMPreston @bishopche3 Blowing unwanted kisses is sexual harassment.
@palewook @HarryMayUltd @poly_monkey @ApfelStrudelll @GlenWoodfin @AshleeMPreston @bishopche3 They talk about harassment. Look at them.
@NolasAFreeGyal @kitkatmom_md @AshleeMPreston @lindymomma Probably because they thought she had enough knowledge to have some common decency. I guess not.
@AshleeMPreston I hope you get sued for defamation. How is that a mammogram?
@SabrielClayr @HarryMayUltd @poly_monkey @ApfelStrudelll @GlenWoodfin @AshleeMPreston @bishopche3 That is not a grope. To grope is to feel or fondle for sexual pleasure. You can't know that man's mindset.
@MisterTylerrr @McFlyTexas @HarryMayUltd @poly_monkey @ApfelStrudelll @GlenWoodfin @AshleeMPreston @bishopche3 He touched her side.
@HarryMayUltd @poly_monkey @ApfelStrudelll @GlenWoodfin @AshleeMPreston @bishopche3 People say sorry all the time out of respect.
@GlenWoodfin @AshleeMPreston They keep accusing that guy of groping her. All he did was put his hand around her.
@monaeltahawy You are crazy. His hand was not on her breast it was on her side.
@KariLakeFox10 It is just that she is shorter and smaller than him and when he put his arm around her that is where his hand ended up.
@Mike_Shapes Pretty sure she has her hands on him as well.
@tdkinser I don't think of a saint that way.
@badmovieman The best movie of all time. All the critics agree.
@badmovieman No talent just nudity.
@RealSaavedra When Christians do it they call it forced conversion on young minds. When progressives do it they say they are doing the right thing.  		All and all they both are wrong if they teach anything other than the truth. A lie is a lie in does not matter who tells it.
@badmovieman Notice how they put the scantily clad woman in the front of the poster.
@gunjakapoor Wow you sound like a murderous dictator.
@feelTHEnature_ Good thing I am not a turtle.
@MarkWarner What about private sector employees? When is the last time you raised the minimum wage for them? I don't want to pay more taxes for people that already make enough to live and have generous pension benefits.
@MarkWarner Why don't you just vote for the pay raise and stop assaulting the president with your words?
@MarkWarner You just assaulted me with your words.
@MarkWarner Protect healthcare? Our healthcare system is terrible. You want to protect a horrible healthcare system?
@mik_dix There used to be common decency laws that were enforced. This meant you couldn't even kiss in public. Today women and men routinely show their sexual and intimate behavior in public.
@mik_dix Ok but I sat in my car while a car pulled up behind me. In the car was a black woman and white man. The two people procedeeded to go to the back seat and have sex all while I was sitting a car length away.
@stevecuozzo @nypost You are really suggesting making policies based on race and gender. They don't come much more moronic than you.
@SFCA4Trump @realDonaldTrump They are protected people.
@SFCA4Trump @realDonaldTrump I didn't know that until he said it.
@FredJoh57935135 Abusive men usually put their tweets in all caps which shows raising ones voice
@hazeleyesgirl2 I must have missed that train.
@FredJoh57935135 You have all the characteristics of an abusive man.
@EricBauman What are you trying to do guilt the burger chain into donating to you?
@EricBauman You are a scumbag. I am not a Republican but I think I am going to boycott you.
@hazeleyesgirl2 There are no princesses in the USA. I try to forget about the monarchy everyday.
@FredJoh57935135 You said: 		#TheWorldWouldBeABetterIf Politicians, judges &amp; bad lawyers would stop abusive men from gaining custody &amp; killing women &amp; our children. #TimesUp4FamilyCourt #DomesticViolence is #PREHOMICIDE 		Pretty sure that only says men.
@FredJoh57935135 You sure did.
@FredJoh57935135 @ReformOurUS @ReeseCampbell7 @c_r_y__o_u_t @MeTooMVMT Ok but you just called me names as well so here is looking at you.
@ValaAfshar You must have been pretty dumb when you were younger.
@JackkJazz They need more money. The poor have too much. How about we put a tax on diapers and baby formula? Starting new families is a threat to the rich.
@CCOHughes You sound like the person who polices everyone.
@StopTheStatute I feel left out. To all the men out there you are the best.
@BillHam83605391 Whahhhhhhhhh😢😢😢. I don't like him and it is not fair.
@FredJoh57935135 @ReformOurUS @ReeseCampbell7 @c_r_y__o_u_t So the 450 were not even all fathers but you originally said that it was all fathers that are guilty of this. You did not say parents. You made it seem that only men do this.
@ReeseCampbell7 @FredJoh57935135 @ReformOurUS @c_r_y__o_u_t @nypost That isn't what was said at first. The 450 cases are not all preventable. Some may have been but we don't know because the stat was broken down that way.
@FredJoh57935135 @ReformOurUS @ReeseCampbell7 @c_r_y__o_u_t We need to do something to stop all of these mothers from murdering these children. Females murdering their kids is a major problem because even 1 life lost is too many. There is a definite pattern here.

@NancyRichmond [T]he relation of male to female is by nature a relation of superior to inferior and ruler to ruled. -Plato
@NancyRichmond I thought Plato was a sexist. How come you are using a quote from a sexist?
@FredJoh57935135 @ReformOurUS @ReeseCampbell7 @c_r_y__o_u_t You are crazier than the day is long. I don't know how many people like their own tweets as well as retweet them.
@FredJoh57935135 @ReformOurUS @ReeseCampbell7 @c_r_y__o_u_t You are annoying. Yeah 450 is not a large number.
@johnpavlovitz What is wrong with that they do that to me all the time?
@JagratiShukla29 That is how they do it  in America as well.
@glennkirschner2 What do you guys do flash a badge to get off of the crimes you commit?
@glennkirschner2 How come the rich get to settle in court if you hold the guilty accountable? Can you save me you are the good guys bs.
@DorianWMusic @PeoplesCourt79 @larrykim You know what don't tell me how to feel about things. I will choose how to feel how I want. You are a rude person.
@FredJoh57935135 @PPact You think that these people are connected to one another. How can one case have anything to do with the other. You tweeted a whole bunch of news stories to make this issue seem like a large issue. The truth is there are 450 cases per year. 450 is not a large number.
@FredJoh57935135 @PPact They should just deal with the 450 cases learn patterns of behavior that are common and watch for those patterns.
@FredJoh57935135 @PPact So how many times is It? You still didn't give me am exact number. If it is 365 that is hardly a large number. You are advocating for increasing regulation and laws on an entire population of people because of 365 cases. That is the definition of extremism.
@DanielAshley13 They do it is called a library.
@Matsamon You sound paranoid you should go seek help.
@Sensiblemann @JordanUhl I think they want to emasculate us and feed us estrogen pills.
@GotBeachGlass @RachelMeadows_ That as well.
@RachelMeadows_ I don't litter. The people that litter should clean it up.
@cindyrellapr Why should Edward Binney have to make crayons according to your expectations?
@cindyrellapr Crayons were invented by a white person.
@FredJoh57935135 @PPact Wow! How many times does that actually happen during the year?
@PPact Sorta like politicians tell me what to do with my life, business, and body. I think the role of the government is to make laws governing morality. It is just that just because you don't like the law doesn't make it wrong.
@UnicornsDonuts I thought we weren't allowed to call women the s word.
@angryblackman17 @UnicornsDonuts Apparently there is a secret club but nevermind me I am paranoid.
@JordanUhl That is interesting how do you expect to do all that because from where I stand there are some people that have it all and many people that have very little.
@PeoplesCourt79 @petacchi_kim @larrykim Do you wear that suit to try and make yourself look more dignified?
@PeoplesCourt79 @petacchi_kim @larrykim How you consider yourself a writer is pretty funny considering you can't even proofread properly.
@petacchi_kim @PeoplesCourt79 @larrykim I think I am going to get some t-shirts made about racism and write a story about how great I am.
@PeoplesCourt79 @petacchi_kim @larrykim She made t-shirts it is hardly an accomplishment.
@PeoplesCourt79 @petacchi_kim @larrykim Oh that poor girl was picked on.
@heeeres_molly @larrykim Liberal group think. Maybe if enough of you express an opposite viewpoint of mine you will be right.
@PeoplesCourt79 @petacchi_kim @larrykim Where did you get the fact that it was 2 black kids? There where about 7 and 2 of them were women. This is really enlightening because when it happens to you I know how you responded when it happened to me.
@PeoplesCourt79 @petacchi_kim @larrykim You are a waste of time. Robert I ain't looking to be converted to your way of thought. I am my human being with my own thoughts and beliefs.
@petacchi_kim @PeoplesCourt79 @larrykim It was actually a group of about 7 of them. I never said I was picked on I merely stated the facts of the situation. You used you liberal morality powers to surmise that I felt picked on.
@PeoplesCourt79 @petacchi_kim @larrykim Is that because she took your side? This is actually fun seeing what you and her actually believe. It is rather enlightening.
@petacchi_kim @PeoplesCourt79 @larrykim What statement was that?
@petacchi_kim @PeoplesCourt79 @larrykim I don't need your help. I didn't ask for your help. I am curious to know what you think you are helping me from.
@petacchi_kim @PeoplesCourt79 @larrykim You are not really a higher authority or a moral authority. You live a life in the way you want to and you make your own morals. Who are you to tell me that I can't make a life for myself and live by my own morals?
@petacchi_kim @PeoplesCourt79 @larrykim Your stance is racist because you say black people have it harder than white people. Are there no white people that need to be adopted?
@petacchi_kim @PeoplesCourt79 @larrykim LOL! I don't understand what your adopted kids have to do with anything and why Robert isn't coming in to accuse you of stealing the spotlight.
@petacchi_kim @PeoplesCourt79 @larrykim You have to be kidding me. You use a phrase with my race in it and you don't find anything wrong with that. Who are you to tell me what I have to do?
@petacchi_kim @PeoplesCourt79 @larrykim I can practice and adopt any culture I want.
@petacchi_kim @PeoplesCourt79 @larrykim So what? I am not sure what that even means you adopted other people's children to take care of them. Why did they need to be adopted in the first place?
@petacchi_kim @PeoplesCourt79 @larrykim Not ready for what? I have to feel the way you tell me to feel. I don't even know what you are talking about.
@gotaco @larrykim When they said it to me I had a hat, sunglasses, and flip flops.
@PeoplesCourt79 @petacchi_kim @larrykim Man I don't really care at this point.
@PeoplesCourt79 @petacchi_kim @larrykim You ain't even worth the time.
@gotaco @larrykim Why do I look like a cop?
@petacchi_kim @PeoplesCourt79 @larrykim I didn't say anything bad about dark complexion people they did it to me. You are crazy.
@gotaco @larrykim See what I mean. He just stereotyped my career based on my skin color.
@petacchi_kim @PeoplesCourt79 I am not apologizing you are crazy I didn't even say anything wrong.
@jojocazz @Jonny_favourite That is defamation I am not a bot.
@jojocazz @Jonny_favourite You are troll with your comments. Who cares you move on?
@PeoplesCourt79 I am 30 years old that is not a self-professed grown man. You keep talking to me in a disrespectful manner but keep acting like you are above reproach.
@PeoplesCourt79 @larrykim You don't seem to have any problem "stealing" the spotlight. You have spoken now you have left. Who do you think you are with your boring book about why you think you are so great?
@PeoplesCourt79 @larrykim I would rather you don't engage me at all. I think you are a disrespectful person who tells others how to act, when they have problems, and to go see a doctor.
@PeoplesCourt79 @larrykim Go fly a kite.
@PeoplesCourt79 @larrykim You going to tell me to seek help now. You are not my doctor. What gives you the right to speak so freely but I must be so shy.? Don't talk to me like your my father. I am a grown man.
@Jonny_favourite @jojocazz She said something for everyone to see and I saw it and responded. Why am I in the wrong and why do I have to explain myself to you?
@Jonny_favourite @jojocazz I am reading tweets and giving my opinion. Why do you care what I think?
@PeoplesCourt79 @larrykim You making sterotypes about me now as well.
@PeoplesCourt79 @larrykim You think because you have a question somebody has to answer it. Stop acting like you don't do anything wrong. I don't answer to you. 	My point is there was a group of dark complexion 11 year olds making stereotypes about me based on my skin color. Why should I feel sorry for her
@PeoplesCourt79 @larrykim Yeah Robert you are so innocent.
@jojocazz @Jonny_favourite You are not even a citizen of Palestine or Israel why would they care what you think about their matters?
@Jonny_favourite @jojocazz Your profile isn't even real.
@jojocazz LOL. You are fake.
@i_chikku You are the only person that isn't an asshole in your own opinion.
@divyaspandana Not sure what you mean.
@Shruthi_S_V So nothing you believe is a lie. I think hardly not.
@jojocazz I don't understand why you are so concerned about Palestine but care so little for your own backyard.
@paulhodgkins3 The rich get richer by stealing from the poor.
@HeartEyes4Brady I am not sure that being positive is an emotion. One can be angry or sad and still be positive. Positivity is more of a thought process. Where sadness and anger are emotions.
@larrykim Ok but I went to a park yesterday and a group of dark complexion people started harrasing me and telling me I look like a cop just because I am white. There was two dark complexion women there that didn't tell the group to stop. All I wanted to do is yoga in a public park.
@LynnGerrard Very few people have said such wise things as the wookie.
@allenquote Just helped two women with a flat change their tire.
@nannymcphil 🤣
@BabyGo2014 @AmandaRay02 I am sure somebody said that before her.
@SRKHolicPankaj Maybe you did something to them.
@LynnGerrard Best quote of the day.
@Rwind_13 @OviyaaSweetz @itzme_sarans @MynLavi @Smriti_uma @Smart__Suren @playmaker_004 @Im_Suji @xo_Juliet_Hana @janicesalintha @uthra_ajay I would say you have trust issues if you can't trust salt and/or sugar.
@tim_fargo Yeah Thomas Jefferson stood like a rock for slavery.
@sdbryner So you finally found out the difference between salt and sugar.
@peterdaou So much for facts.
@EneidaCanev @theRealKiyosaki That is too funny.
@MisterShrimps Can one thing exist without the other? If there was no hot there would be no cold. If there was no light there would be no dark. If there was no happy there would be no sad. If there was no male there would be no female. Do you understand simpleton?
@MisterShrimps I stand by my words. You just don't understand them.
@mkrupit It is impossible for the dead to be living as they are two completely opposite attributes that one cannot possess at the same time.
@mkrupit Philly isn't even close to the hottest city on Earth.
@alishadianna1 Yeah because that is the only option left.
@MattLayton If will can outdo skill the activities you participate in don't require much skill.
@Stacy_Israel If it takes you a day to stand up I feel sorry for you.
@Simeon_ps Put that in a bill that says you talking and only you talking is a jailable offense and I agree.
@winnieg12abby It isn't really that hard most kids know how to say it by 6.
@dah_nce You need to reevaulate what is hard and what is easy.
@AdventComics That is fair to say in your lifetime it feels different but maybe it only feels different now because you are older and wiser and notice it when before you did not.
@AdventComics How could you know it feels different if you were not alive since the beginning of human interaction?
@MisterShrimps Umm yeah it is entirely true.
@MJasonHouck @BrittMichaelian When speaking in generalizations, what they say is only generally true.
@tim_fargo I am pretty sure it is the load.
@abp_psych Females are good at multitasking and are concerned about safety for all.
@sdbryner You have a problem trusting salt and sugar?
@AdventComics I am pretty sure that is the way it always has been.
@eliistender10 Yeah let us all play with legos, write kids books and play guitars. I call for a global ban of legos because they are made of plastic and plastic is a major cause of sea life death.
@JenniferMaslin @eliistender10 Are you advocating vigilante justice just because you don't like the activities other people engage in?
@UN_Women I agree we need more women plumbers, construction workers, soldiers, and oil rig workers. We have enough princesses already.
@ChrisJZullo How is this motovational?
@VusiThembekwayo Hearing quotes from Al Sharpton actually depress me and not motivate me.
@korekoreGlobal You are only supposed to get a job if you are qualified. Fake friends expect their friends to give them jobs for friendship.
@elusive_1_ Grab the boogie boards and boogie.
@ehahn5_shirk @HartshipJ @LiliWhiteWrites @keithawynn Why didn't you follow your own advice? No need to even say anything your platform is based on fallacy and emotion.
@shennessey44 @keithawynn Don't have time to explain facts to those that don't understand them, sorry.
@shennessey44 @keithawynn Your group makes up facts and passes lies for truth.
@HartshipJ @LiliWhiteWrites @keithawynn It's mostly because sexism isn't real. People act a certain way and get treated in accordance to how th ey act. Men for the most part don't complain and go to work. Women are constantly complaining. To me a person who is always complaining is weak.
@LiliWhiteWrites @keithawynn Men are half of that equation.
@curriculumchef @keithawynn Women demean men as well.
@keithawynn Try imagining digging a ditch in 100 degree heat or fighting in a war.
@yetiite @DPhamK @AngelaHanks That is what I am talking about. They say the same thing with the NBA and WNBA. Male players play at a much higher level than female players at the professional level. They should put the best team in the NBA vs the best team in the WNBA and play for who gets higher pay.
@SymoneDSanders @Politicon You can't make claims about people that are not true.
@SymoneDSanders You sound like a bully yourself.
@tylerchadee @SymoneDSanders I never thought it was masculine to do what that man did.
@troy_coulter @SymoneDSanders This woman has problems. Round up all white men? Men have toxic masculinity? What is she even talking about?
@MichaelFairbro6 @DesmondDreckett How do you know people are deaf to silence? I like to sit in the quiet all the time.
@DesmondDreckett What if the person who is talking is a liar? Is it important to know a lie?
@coolghost101 Ok, but what do you say?
@ellaesversatil @DesmondDreckett He believes for some reason that he is the one who should talk because his views and ideas make more sense than yours.
@MichaelFairbro6 @DesmondDreckett What if you are deaf?
@dream_successes @DesmondDreckett What makes you the one to speak and me the one to listen? You spoke but did not just listen.
@DesmondDreckett If everyone listens, who talks?
@FreedomfrmMedia @NadimShayk @SwamiGeetika Ok but the Earth is meant for everyone and not just vegetarians.
@AnilBinwal1 @zafar_zee @SwamiGeetika Karma if acted by a person is revenge. Karma acted by a person without trial is vigilantism. Karma worked in the court is justice. There is no Karma worked by the universe.
@zafar_zee @SwamiGeetika He must have eaten meat so she might think that is a just punishment.
@HAFSA48045671 @shaulvardi @Drshadabsk @SwamiGeetika We should all just refrain from eating because of her opinion on how people should live a life.
@SwamiGeetika I can't believe you actually think that a sheep is the same as a person. It is actually rather offensive.		So your ok with lions eating zebras, alligators eating gazelle, bears eating salmon, hyenas eating buffalo, etc but when a human eats a sheep it is wrong. ??????
@NitishChoubey5 Karma sounds like revenge. Is revenge a good thing?
@NitishChoubey5 Then who?
@NitishChoubey5 By you?
@amjoyshow @MSNBC I don't understand why their are race specific jobs. Black American Jobs??? What are you talking about? This seems kind of racist since you are dark complexion and are advocating only for other dark complexion people. Why didn't you discuss medium complexion and light complexion?
@lbeckman @shannonrwatts Since there are no gender roles this is a short list of things women should not expect of men...		1. Lift heavy things.	2. Open doors.	3. Defend you against attack.	4. Reach something you can't.	5. Explain things you don't understand.	etc
@Bri_Takenaka_Li @SandwichesJill @lbeckman @IBeckman I don't really fear feminism I just don't really agree with it. The last thing that scares me is a bunch of women screaming their opinion. It is like watching a pack of Shih Tzus bark at you. More comical than anything else.
@Bri_Takenaka_Li @SandwichesJill @lbeckman @IBeckman You sound like a woman baby. I treated you the same way you treared others.
@lbeckman @shannonrwatts I am not sure how a quote relinquishes boys of responsibility or how it does anything you say it does.
@kharrop22 @OhioStAthletics Did the women bench press 315 for ten?
@fendibodybagsxo This is the point I try to make as well. No belief system or political movement includes everyone. Feminism is just as oppressive as Jim Crow or Patriarchy. If someone argues against feminism the feminists scream to quiet them or oppress them.
@ArafathNihar I agree 100% with you man. We are called oppressors by feminists but I hardly see how men are oppressors but women are not.
@LS_dweet They also could be just pretending to be your friend in order to use you.
@heidos777 @LilaGraceRose You should learn the difference between a fact and an opinion.
@heidos777 @LilaGraceRose Females have not been oppressed any more than males have. Arguing with you is a waste of time.
@DikshaS71790351 I am not sure how one just stops learning. Learning is a consequence of life.
@Sir_Farticus I agree. No pitcher should ever hit a batter.
@sampadscales That really was a nice act.
@TalbertSwan That is a really silly reason to ban someone.
@DesmondDreckett Not quite sure why that makes everything easier.
@prowpodcast @NealPierson @davemeltzerWON Do you even watch wrestling, 90 percent of what goes on is offensive or can be seen as offensive.
@KelseyARees @davemeltzerWON So the men aren't critiqued based on their "looks". Give me a break.
@davemeltzerWON Man it is ok for you to have an opinion.
@pastorlocke So is any organized religion. Atheism is more natural than any other religion.
@the_ironsheik Bro I come to this hashtag to hear the wisdom not the voice of fools. #VoiceOfFools
@Alina__IV Maybe there is a better hashtag for this. It hardly qualifies as wisdom. Maybe #JustAnotherDisrespectfulWoman
@lilyseyes47 @SharedMotivati1 No correlation.
@heidos777 @LilaGraceRose You really quote that article as serious academic literature. That article is filled with opinion. Better sexy time??? Are you kidding me. Since when is better sexy time a valid reason for the success of feminism. Are you joking?
@alwalker_13 How can men suffer from PMS when it is a hormonal change that occurs a week before a period? Men don't ovulate.
@mr_nuruddeen When don't women blame men for all the problems in the world?
@sanotech86 I find that men are underpaid.
@AngryBlackLady So you think that people should do things you want at the expense of the greater good? Seems kind of self-centered and egotistical. You think you are more important than society as a whole?		Your tweet is a generalization about how black women are treated and is not true.
@heidos777 @LilaGraceRose I would just kindly disagree. Feminism has not done more for men than men have. That has to be one of the most ridiculous statements I have ever heard.
@MildredAskew You mean don't ask a guy at a gas station to put out his cigarette?
@cpt_intl How nice of you to preach.
@lilygc I don't understand why you are focusing on one gender. Aren't there male veterans that are homeless as well?
@ValaAfshar I thought the biggest communication problem was having two people that don't speak the same language and no interpreter.
@Musolek Inaction is the opposite of action and success  is the opposite of failure.
@RainbowSweety22 This viewpoint is very self-centered. I agree with you that we should listen to our own heart. However we should also listen to the wisdom of our mind and others. Ignore the ignorance. If someone cannot or does not know don't heed their voice.
@FaberBooks I agree the books you choose to read say a lot about your personality.
@niccid72 And all are signs of experience.
@johnpavlovitz So now being quiet is a crime. Is there anything people can do except for what you tell them they can.
@wepray4Potus @LucasBryner3 That was very clever of you. He gave a proclamation himself. Don't listen to any other man but him.
@kharyp You just made a stereotype and generalization about armed people. There are unarmed people that make threats like that as well.
@JHCollins7 @ChrisPrattIsGod @Reaper_004 @lisawborden @AynRandPaulRyan Actually he is not labeling all media as enemy of the people.
@AynRandPaulRyan The concept that the blood is on the hands of Trump is just as real as the concept that the blood is on the media's hands.
@AynRandPaulRyan That is an opinion piece. What is the point of disputing someone elses opinion? Everyone knows opinions are not factual but rather emotional. People who argue using emotion won't admit they are wrong because emotion won't allow them.
@asjadnazir Some mistakes can be final.
@GOTAllDayLong @johnpavlovitz Ok but that doesn't make it right.
@johnpavlovitz So you get to determine why someone else likes or dislikes someone else. They are not allowed to have their own opinion?
@EvanCarmichael So laughing at someone who fails makes you a failure but failing at something makes you a success. 		There are many comedians that laugh at other's failures that are a big success.
@johnpavlovitz I don't feel very motivated by your tweet maybe you don't know what the word motivation means.
@charliekirk11 Presidents make people commit crime, apply for food stamps, and look for work. -Charlie Kirk
@charliekirk11 You seem to like to blame presidents for problems.
@prasanshairie I agree with what you say. There is no person that is completely honest or moral.
@handmeahoe @tedtully This is so true.
@tedtully Ok but why are both allowed to hate on people that are not jewish or muslim. Some muslims routinely preach the death to America. Some jews routinely preach homosexuality is a sin. Neither should utter a negative word about anyone if they don't want a negative word uttered back.
@ella432928508 Tell that to Brutus.
@TotalExteriors1 How come you don't practice it?
@ariannahuff Worrying is fear or anxiety caused by an outcome you don't want. Praying is done for an outcome you do what.
@damocrat You response is not very well thought out don't speak so loudly if you don't want to be heard.
@TheApexFan Ok but this applies to you as well.
@T_Harv_Eker I agree with you, failure is one of the best teachers. If you are fully aware you can also learn from your successes. Rembering how you did something right allows you to do it right in the future.
@leighsteinberg I do see truth to this statement. In order to achieve your best effort in any given activity you must ensure that your focus is on that activity entirely.
@Nora_McManus I don't really agree with your quote. Each person acts independently and I can smile at someone even if they look at me with a scowl.
@damocrat I would be interested to see what your definition of an idiot was. If an idiot is anyone that doesn't agree with you than you are really not ever going to have much of a debate but rather always an agreement.
@AdamMGrant You can learn from doing. The people who do first are usually the ones who write the books on it. Therefore leaders are doers and not necessarily readers. There are leaders on football teams and basketball teams and they don't necessarily have to read to become it.
@pakoosa123 @dillmop @RealCandaceO We are all individuals and have our own unique reasons for doing the things we do.
@Theodora_Lee This really is quite silly because if you were old and were able to become young again when you were young you were wish that you were old and vice versa.
@vintagebooks I would say rather they are the mirrors of the mind.  A person writing a book on crime or murder isn't necessarily a criminal. If it were a look into the soul then they would have to be. If it is a look in the mind it only shows that they have the ability to think like one.
@NerdAboutTown Actually this is not true because in order to have a piece first you must cut the cake. A piece by definition is a part of whole made by a cut. If you cut a tiny sliver out of the cake and eat the big piece I think you are ok.
@PenguinUKBooks The quote is very interesting and thoughtful but I do not agree. It often times is a difficult decision to originally act but it can also be more difficult doing the thing you've decided to act on. Deciding to write a book is much easier than having to come up with content for it
@Goss30Goss If we are a society that works together I don't see what it matters if it's a woman or man that wins. Your statement to me seems that there is a fight going on between male and female. It is hard for me to see how there is a fight going on when men and women survive in unison.
@dillmop @pakoosa123 @RealCandaceO Your Tweet stereotypes and generalizations about the left as if every person that has a political viewpoint on the left end of the spectrum is the same. I would say there is a difference between hate of a person for reasons that are not logical and having reasons based in fact.
@DPhamK @AngelaHanks Sorry but it is not a definition of wage gap because in tennis there is a men's tennis and a women's tennis and men don't play women. If Serena would play Rodger Federer or any other male tennis player she might not have the same success that she has against other females.
@conscious_sis @AngelaHanks Well if my point is dumb and you judged it that way obviously you have to be smarter. How else do you judge someone as dumb? If you are dumb and you judge a point as dumb it is a dumb point because you are dumb and made it.
@DPhamK @AngelaHanks Your logic is not accurate Serena Williams is number 5 on the all time highest tennis player list at $160 million. You pick one year as an example and try to pass it off as the rule.
@jtbetterjones @CottonAndieRaS @AngelaHanks @Venuseswilliams Ok but that was only one match.
@conscious_sis @AngelaHanks I don't see why my point is dumb but you are so smart. I feel like you have an elitist attitude or an attitude in which you feel like your points are more valid than others.
@MeganLe04773188 I don't know if your whole movement is serious. First off you are grouping all black women together and saying they all make less than white men. You are focusing on race and are being divisive. There is no way you know why each individual makes what they do.
@sialche @AngelaHanks Your tweet is not constructive. I don't consider what I am saying trolling.
@CottonAndieRaS @AngelaHanks @Venuseswilliams Why do they have a woman's tennis and a man's tennis? They should just have tennis and the best players play each other.
@donnabrazile You get paid more than many people in your field.
@AngelaHanks How come Serena Willams or Beyonce don't suffer from the wage gap?
@ShelleyZalis @AngelaDiversity @LisaColemanPhD Why did they make so much less?
@TheKarolynMarie What is the biggest cause of unhappiness if you are not over thinking
@larrykim It is amazing how people can use different words to fit their agenda but ignore the words of others trying to fit theirs.
@PenguinUKBooks So very true.
@RT_com Ok but there are people in every race that murder people.
@IceCreamEaterrr You mean like Elvis when he first came out. Some people had negative things to say about him as well.
@Ziggy_Daddy Why do you expect white people to be racist to you and other people of color?
@lebo_lmn People no matter the race share common attributes they also have differences. The common attributes unite the differences divide.
@iPushedHelen It can be seen as a little racist depending on your character and the content of last tweets and actions in life.
@TalbertSwan Umm I didn't say any of those things and you are directing hate towards a specific race of people. Doing the same thing as your oppressers means that you too are an oppressor.
@Devildog2003 @RealCandaceO Umm not really they give themselves a bad name as they don't speak for me. Each person is an individual.
@dillmop @RealCandaceO This is not unique to leftists.
@JamieWa40628952 @RealCandaceO @MsPassionator I didn't even realize I was in a war about anything.
@ItsMeJessAriane @RealCandaceO I would be interested to see your facts to support your comment.
@marklutchman @RealCandaceO How so?
@RealCandaceO I appreciate that you do that. You are doing the right thing. I feel your pain.
@smwyzard046 @keithboykin Legally I don't know if he has ever been convicted of a crime or rape. If what some people say about him is true it goes to show how good money is at getting you out of trouble.
@keithboykin When you put it all down like that it does seem to paint a pretty definite picture of his character.
@realDonaldTrump Hey Donald both Lebron and Lemon are allowed to have opinions in a free country. Their opinions may be innacurate or not factual but this doesn't take away from the fact that they are allowed to have an opinion. You have many opinions that are also innacurate or not factual.
