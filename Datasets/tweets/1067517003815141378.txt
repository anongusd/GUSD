*I remember you told me, that it made you believe in no man/no cry, &amp; maybe that’s why* https://t.co/oEFC7o6cSp
🤷🏽‍♀️
People who can’t be friends with people who they don’t think are up. People who are friends with higher ups despite how they got there. 🤷🏽‍♀️ yolo.
I just realized I haven’t had a close, spiritual mentor... ever.
Date is a word. Dates don’t have to be romantic. Romantic dates involve showing your romantic interest effort in generosity, etc. 🤷🏽‍♀️ not mad at any outcomes. A little mad at the double standard though.
Being on here feels like watching Gotham city.
Oh, Twitter. Ily.
Remembers anything she posted to Smule... cringes.
Remembers rapping to Juicy J on Smule. Cringes.
😒😏🤦🏽‍♀️
I’ve really wanted to make a joke for like months now, but I cannot.
😏 yeah it’s me.
Fml- late on a Monday.
But does it matter? No.
I do suppose that these two lessons show that you should stick to your plans &amp; do what you want.  For instance, the two of them don’t even like each other. So if I told them about the other’s stories they both would tell me not to be friends with the other person LOL.
People I know are petty as fuck. This girl came over to order food with me &amp; brought sodas to my house- unannounced @ the soda part. Then when I didn’t want to pay her for the sodas she takes them out of the fridge. 🤷🏽‍♀️ Like, is it me? Probably.🤷🏽‍♀️
I have someone who likes to go out drinking then call me anywhere from 1 AM to 3 AM afterwards. I pick up the phone &amp; it’s not an emergency I hang up. You get mad. Multiple times a week. Youre really not that special to me. Someone’s MCM is still doing this. #annoying https://t.co/WoPR13D1po

This is why I don’t try to speak in depth to my little cousins ✌🏽😹🏳️
One of my friends defined my type as “spanish-looking.” &amp;, yeah. All of them. That’s such a broad term but it just makes so much sense.
In retrospect, dirty mouths seem to be a theme. I guess “dirty” is relative. https://t.co/nvws9dojVv

Omg men with exotic features. I’m mixed with black and Asian. What do I find exotic?! Lmao.
Well. Like my old reality. Sydthesavage, babe, Sydthesavage.
Why did I just dream the Elon Musk had me over, one hit quit it, &amp; asked me to leave as all of his friends started showing up to hang?! It like my real life, but with a man I’d actually want to hookup with. (Respectfully..)
Guess we all have our things. I definitely do.
Hangs with guy. Notices he doesn’t wash hands after bathroom, multiple times. Remind him to do so. Walk in bathroom to see he did use the sink but did not turn off the water before exiting. Oh, so you really really don’t wash your hands. Oh-Kay.
Feeling very Macky right now...

People tell you “don’t judge others.” Judging is a life skill. Whether or not you want to believe it; it’s called making life decisions. Whether you want to believe it, you snub people to be where you want. “Judge wisely.”
