@ianandrewrauch @PolitiFact No one is free from bias and that includes myself and all the people affiliated with our website. And yes, the Trump effect has very much polarized the country. The Huff Post is left biased as we rate them, but just source information well and correct false information.
@ianandrewrauch @PolitiFact I am just happy you didn't come up with a George Soros conspiracy.
@Kadmos1 I don't believe we have any extreme left hate groups added as of yet. There are some black nationalist groups out there that may, but I am not sure they would be classified as left. If one is submitted to us we will add it. We do have plenty of the others, just not hate groups.

@Lazulioness @Bigape321 @jbr0wn12 @Grandmasoup22 @AnaPorras5 @CNN @realDonaldTrump Fox news is a propaganda network. They are a state government source now and not credible. They are essentially everything the right has been complaining about for the last 7 elections, but not favor the right...so.
@Bigape321 @jbr0wn12 @Lazulioness @Grandmasoup22 @AnaPorras5 @CNN @realDonaldTrump They are left leaning for sure, but they are evidence based. I know this will automatically trigger a left wing rejection of MBFC, but this is the truth man. Sorry. I cannot make you see it. You have to find it.

@jbr0wn12 @Lazulioness @Grandmasoup22 @Bigape321 @AnaPorras5 @CNN @realDonaldTrump I agree with that Jbrown. One would also have to agree that constantly calling credible media that criticizes the President, Fake News, is equally dangerous, if not more so as it undermines the free press, which is essential for public discourse.
@Lazulioness @jbr0wn12 @Grandmasoup22 @Bigape321 @AnaPorras5 @CNN @realDonaldTrump Agree. Reuters is more straightforward. Thanks!

@Politisite That is great. Are you requesting a review? We will be happy to put you at the top of the 300 sources on the list. Sorry if we missed you.
@Politisite So the stock photo that is not included in the actual article is a trigger. You might be looking too deep. A picture of a gun shop. Period. This is why bias is a problem.
@Politisite Do you want us to review you? Typically we only review sites that have either published false claims or receive more than 20K views per month. Similar Web does not list your stats. Do you receive 20K or more per month? If so, we would be happy to review you. Let us know.

@kafkaguy @TheGoldWaterUS @jamespyx Due to the holidays that review probably won't be complete until later in the week.
@kafkaguy @TheGoldWaterUS @jamespyx Again, I have never disputed your integrity, Philip. I dispute the integrity of the person who changed the links used on our review. You seem to be a fine writer. Let my reviewer complete their review and then if you want to debate fine.
Daily Source Bias Check: Truth Out https://t.co/arZEX2cXdH
@kafkaguy @TheGoldWaterUS @jamespyx One last thing. I meant Politifact and not Poynter. And two areas where your article is factually wrong is MBFC is not a one person operation and CNN is rated Mixed for factual reporting. All of the other info you wrote was subjective opinion, which you are entitled too. Good day
@kafkaguy @TheGoldWaterUS @jamespyx I am done discussing this with you. Whatever my researcher comes up with is what will be placed on the page. If you want to write another negative article feel free. It will not bias our final rating of your website.
@kafkaguy @TheGoldWaterUS @jamespyx Philip, the deception I spoke of was in you or the editor placing your story about us on the pages we had linked in our review. That right there is a huge red flag for credibility. You should have just put the article on the front page and left your old stories in place.
@kafkaguy @TheGoldWaterUS @jamespyx Myself or the reviewer never said that you personally published fake news.
@kafkaguy @TheGoldWaterUS @jamespyx Thanks for the offer. I want my researcher to look at the content without bias and see what they come up with.
@kafkaguy @TheGoldWaterUS Thank you for answering. We will have a new review up within a few days. Based on our conversations I felt best to have another researcher do the review.

Can you explain why you don't have this information on your website? This will help me as I re-review your site. Please read this also. https://t.co/571cuBJly2
@kafkaguy @TheGoldWaterUS I was kind enough to answer your questions. I have a few for you. What is your name? You fail to disclose it on the website and on your Twitter account. A person who claims to be a journalist does not use fake names. Next question coming up.
Daily Source Bias Check: Pacific Pundit https://t.co/pxOr3qZFml
@kafkaguy @TheGoldWaterUS Further, any source listed on our website as Mixed for factual reporting, I would not personally use as source on social media or research for an article.
@kafkaguy @TheGoldWaterUS I would want to verify information from Buzzfeed because they have a Pants on Fire Claim from Politifact. So, while 99% or more of their info is legit, there is always a seed of doubt and hence why I would not use them as source. Not sure how to be more clear.

@xerxeswatkins @HW_BEAT_THAT However, as was pointed out in another post here, spinning facts, being selective is also a form of bias that is deceptive. The evidence may be there, but there is something missing or implied that changes the message. See CNN and FOX.
@xerxeswatkins @HW_BEAT_THAT Basically.
@xerxeswatkins @HW_BEAT_THAT Bias spins factual information. Fake is just fake. It is really simple. Go to @AllSidesNow and read the comparisons between left and right articles. That is the difference. Confirmation bias is the key.
@xerxeswatkins @HW_BEAT_THAT They are? Who's payroll? What are you talking about?
@xerxeswatkins @HW_BEAT_THAT Jim, please list some far left websites that are fake news that should be on our questionable list. Please link to sources that refute the information and make sure it is on our least biased list or has multiple credible sources to back it up right or left. I will review them.
@xerxeswatkins @HW_BEAT_THAT I honestly have no idea of the mistake. Here is an example. This review just came in from one of our reviewers. There are literally 1000's of foreign sites peddling fake right wing news. Check it out and the source and our review. Decide for yourself. https://t.co/G1WJLj9ttB
@xerxeswatkins @HW_BEAT_THAT Ok Jim. Not worth it all. Have a Merry Christmas.
BuzzFeed wins right to keep identity of Steele dossier source a secret https://t.co/uI8mmqePmZ https://t.co/Bc3tKZMP9x
@xerxeswatkins @HW_BEAT_THAT Buzzfeed is not fake news at all. Almost all of their reporting is evidence based. When they jump the gun they retract and correct. They just do it a more often than the NYT. Fox News and CNN have a mixed rating also for the same reason. Bias and fake are very different.
@cipher_simian @kafkaguy @HW_BEAT_THAT I don't know what you want me to say. I have explained Buzzfeed over and over. If you have a specific question ask it, otherwise I am not sure what you want.
@cipher_simian @HW_BEAT_THAT I don't want to keep repeating myself. Please.
@cipher_simian @HW_BEAT_THAT We are going in circles here. I have explained the difference. Good day.
@Conker327 @HW_BEAT_THAT Yes, Buzzfeed leans left, but their sole purpose is to sell ads. They also attack the left too when it is sensational enough to make money. Buzzfeed is a source, much like The Hill that likes to be the first to report something and have it go viral.
@cipher_simian @HW_BEAT_THAT Yes. They failed a fact check and they have retracted stories, which means rushing to put them on your Facebook page is not advisable without some sort of back up source. Again, much different than the sources on the Questionable list. That is all.
@cipher_simian @HW_BEAT_THAT Any source we rate Mixed for factual reporting should be fact checked against a High factual source. It is that simple. Buzzfeed is not a source I would share on social media.
@cipher_simian @HW_BEAT_THAT We gave them a mixed factual rating because they failed a fact check and rush stories out only to retract or correct. This is different than a source that publishes ridiculous blatantly fake news and leaves it up. See Occupy Democrats on the left or Conservative Post on the Rt.
@cipher_simian @HW_BEAT_THAT But, they certainly are not fake news.
@cipher_simian @HW_BEAT_THAT The Dossier is real in that it exists. What is in it is a different story. Unfortunately, Journalists and media sources do not have to reveal their source. While this is understandable in some cases, it really leads to problems. Again, Buzzfeed is not a very reliable source.
@HW_BEAT_THAT I also don't want to engage in a debate about our respective biases. We stand by our methodology and not everyone will agree, as bias is mostly subjective. Happy Holidays and Merry Christmas.
@HW_BEAT_THAT Correct we all have bias.
@HW_BEAT_THAT Buzzfeed is accurate 99% of the time. In order to make the Questionable list you need to have a very poor track record and not correct errors. Buzzfeed does this. However, we rate Buzzfeed Mixed for factual reporting because they do jump the gun sometimes.
@HW_BEAT_THAT We review what is submitted to us. We would love to have more Left wing sites sent to us. We address this in our FAQ. Also, recognize that we have close to 100 Right wing fake sources from Macedonia on the list, which skews it heavily. https://t.co/EucKMkyrJu

@estormzap Fair enough. I have no idea what we just argued here.
@estormzap I really need to know which quote or quotes you are referring to. Are we arguing whether Rush said it? I don't know what quotes.
@estormzap I feel like there is some misunderstanding here. Which quote specifically is missing?
@estormzap You left out the "They may" part of that statement. Many left and right biased sources publish factual info which we indicate on each source
@estormzap In the article they publish the audio from his show. One thing that Rush does is he publishes his transcripts from shows which is handy.
@estormzap @JuddLegum Far left and right sources are not always wrong. This is just quoting Rush and adding some opinion to it.
