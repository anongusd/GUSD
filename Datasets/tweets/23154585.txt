@dieri it only ended like 10 minutes ago
@dieri you should get off twitter if you don't want a spoiler

@SheilaDC yes!! Also a perk of the internal alarm clock!
I suppose having an internal alarm clock is good, but I really want/need to sleep in until 8 just one day this 3-day weekend!
There is no good time of the day to go to the gym on a #snowday. At least people are staying active!
I bet the local DC news reporters are sad their live reports aren't at 3am. Not much snow yet and they're like IT'S INSANE #notyet
I'm mean.
Been a ridiculous day of inconveniences, but I was 100% reimbursed for my order of daily contact lenses, and that made me smile.
UGH dozens of my friends went to the Seattle Seahawks parade. It was clear and beautiful and in MY downtown. I miss my first city.

You better be doing your taxes if your team isn't in the Super Bowl. No excuses. #really
Of course they've never done any such thing even for the Ice Bowl, but it was wild

Funny thing is my password wasn't even English and had more than one numbers/symbols. In any case, happy Monday to you all!
Sorry for the hack, folks - I haven't been terribly active on twitter lately so that's probably why. Apologies! And thank you!

I love Seattle. So much. Maybe it's college nostalgia, maybe it's being 6+ years removed, but I LOVE this town, esp. with my husband.
I was a twitter fail in 2013, mostly because I kept forgetting about it, or use it for super random venting that 2 people would notice. :P
@dieri ha I know, their insecurity just makes me mad when it's taken out on me. I don't criticize their bad choices to their faces. :P
@dieri Eating plenty of (healthy) fats, carbs and proteins every 3 hours and running 30 miles a week somehow means I never eat.
@dieri it makes me feel sick AND it's terrible for you. There are "healthy" fats. They anger me w/their obesity diseases, criticizing ME.
It's amazing that if you say you don't eat fried things, beef, or cheese, they think you're not eating anything at all. C'mon people.
@dieri there were several sequels in the late '90s / early 2000s, not sure when but probably awful!

Well, I guess *I* thought it wasn't healthy food. This isn't a good incentive though, now I feel like I can get away with it. :P
Ate and drank a LOT over the 3-week break (def less healthy food than usual), and ran only 5 times, and somehow I didn't gain weight

@AKbirder long story!
Pinterest made me feel better about this possibility of rain on our outdoor ceremony next Saturday.
Trying not to lose hope when looking at next week's forecast in Southcentral. Fairbanks, I'm mad. Why can't you have crappy weather instead?
After an incredible summer, just like clockwork, Alaska has to turn cool and rainy in August. Wish we could have wedding in June :(
I think the O's had the more embarrassing loss tonight....
Sleep deprivation still a problem, but at least I'm not as edgy. Ten days!
@wendipqa LOVE @BeadazzledUSA in Dupont Circle - amazing assortment, and especially love that they have real pearls!

Not a helpful thought: if it weren't for bullpen implosion in top 9th, Werth would've won it. In much style.
Um. Yeah. That 2nd base umpire is on my growing shitlist. Laz Diaz. You beast.
And WHY is Werth the only guy who can hit?! C'mon.

@IamSauerkraut haha seriously, I kind of found this transition during this engagement: "My man thing" - awkward, but it works
3 weeks from tomorrow!! 22 days and we'll be married. Always felt married these 4.5 years, in a good way, but still :)
@NationalsDaily why are you tweeting this!!
Strasburg doesn't often do well in intense heat. Also, I feel sorry for anyone with advanced tickets for tonight's game.
Like they RSVP for one and WEEKS later: oh just kidding it's FIVE. Um weddings cost money, jerks.
How do you tell people to STOP RSVPing....
Baseball montages are so comforting and happily emotional, I can cozy up and dream in them. Told you I'm sappy.

Heat index 94 before 10am. When I go to work at these temps, the prospect of freezing inside all day makes it bearable. #heatwave
7 rather ^
But hey, just remember, Harper is 8 years younger than the beastly Cespedes. Great work by both!
Ah nothing like hot tea inside blasting AC when the heat index is 98 out there. Not complaining.
@dieri it's Bay Area history!! Fail!!
@goshrx haha true story. That's a ton of pitches. He's younger than Johan Santana though, should recover better.
@goshrx and! They moved in the fences this year too.

@dieri and why are you awake??
@dieri yeah just had one beer with dinner like at 7:30pm. Evidently mistook my beer glass for water and filled it last night; bleck!

@AK_Chick exactly, ranted about it :P plus we discussed this all day today at work - there's only so much one can do
I'm over it now. But seriously, we shouldn't have to post or tweet something just to "prove" we care.
Because i rant about stupid/funny Volkswagen ad it means I don't care about the Alaska taxi plane crash. Rude people piss me off to no end.
RIDICULOUS Volkswagen Bug ad claiming it's in "Fairbanks," my hometown. That ad is so far from the truth, except Noble Street.
What to do with minor knee injury? Watch baseball and make my wedding earrings! http://t.co/IFxBcEilu9
Now would be the time to make the bracelets and earrings I need to do... benefit to injury!
Also, I want to cry watching all the runners on this beautiful evening. Fall could've been much worse, but I'm super, super sad. :(
You know you live in DC when you hear @the_west_wing opening credits in 3 apartments while walking home.
@wendipqa nope, just knees and heel of my hands. Luckily just skin, no serious injury. Embarrassing walk home. :P
Finally got the motivation and ran for maybe 6 minutes, and boom. Now my knees are gross and I always wear skirts to work. :(
Finally ate dirt while running. Knew I should've done the treadmill tonight. Took years of fearing it, now I can move on....
Air conditioning for the win, suckas
Who else is baking pumpkin pie in July? Leftover canned pumpkin and evaporated milk from December will not go to waste. Boy's 30th bday pie.
I was going to name a bunch of nats who are beastly this week, but it's basically everyone. They're all beasts. #knockonwood
Perfect July evening out there (by DC standards) - wish we could go to the ballgame!
…which basically means, no, I will not ask them. I will simply tell them about it afterward if they want to mail me anything…

Mets cried mercy by putting in their backup catcher to pitch, and Desmond didn't hear them cry.
Oh sweet glory. Really ok with not giving Harvey that win.
This game has made me mad and SO glad. Let's keep up with the latter!!
Ok Alaska, it's definitely warmer in DC than there again. But still darn warm in AK.
@wendipqa our Chief is bringing it back :) but thanks! His name is Rafi, says he works for our boss too
@wendipqa aww thanks so much!! Did you notice my coworker had his too? Haha :)
@jtspiv haha YES. Chris hasn't been to Homer since he was a little kid, so it's a must for sure. I've been to the saloon once.
Alaskans: budget-friendly MUST-dos in Homer in mid-August? Thinking about 3 days.
@DCyetti ha yeah I have a couple dozen or so Fairbanks people on here. I'll crowdsource Facebook too.
Fairbanks ladies: do you have a favorite spa in town? Want to give Mom a gift certificate as a thank you.
@wendipqa ha I know, I'm just vain. None of our friends here think we're "shotgunning," but certain invitees haven't seen us in a year :P
@wendipqa ugh now I'm paranoid that my earlier tweet made it sound like I gained weight or something, definitely not the case!  #vain
@wendipqa yeah it's nobody I've seen recently though - I'm a 0-2 so it's kind of obvious to everyone here haha
I've noticed I don't get carded if I order an Old Fashioned
Hope everyone is enjoying solstice, especially my Alaskan friends and family
I feel half sick (fighting off an office bug), half the people I know are out of town including boy. But at least I got to run on the Mall!
Desmond should've yelled STEAK
Yeeeeeeeeeessss!!!!!!
DESIIIIIIIIIIII AAAAHHHHH
Boy completely called that a pitch early - he's really good at calling WAS home runs...
Cliff's got some nasty stuff. Still one of my favorite pitchers, regardless of team.
really could use @RyanMattheus right here #2pitches3outs
Ha an Anchorage colleague says, "If it's not freezing, it's on fire." The post-late-breakup-heat-wave continues.
@IamSauerkraut ha don't worry, we watched the last half of the game.
my twitter feed is sooooo indicative of whether our boys lost/won. I love you guys.
ARG.
YEEEESSSSSSSSS I KNEW IT I KNEW IT I KNEW IT #papelbooooooooo
@wendipqa nope, not until August 4-23. I'd be AMAZED if there was a serious heat wave then!
@wendipqa you're in the sun ;) but really NOT jealous of the AK heat wave - impossible to sleep bc the buildings aren't equipped for it!
And it's 86 in Fairbanks and 72 in Anchorage, though Anchorage residents seem to think it's also 90 there... ha :)
It's ACTUALLY 94 degrees in Talkeetna. It's not "omg it feels like it's over 90," it actually is.
@SusanBMorgan yeah definitely part of it. And the hot days in DC are humid only like a quarter of the time, it's not constant
Also, not jealous. Alaskans, I know it's crazy hot inside. Ice packs and cold washcloths on your forearms and chest are awesome.
@SusanBMorgan I much prefer 90 degrees in DC to 90 (or even 80) in Alaska. Worst sleeps ever during AK heat waves (usu w/ forest fire smoke)
90 degrees in Talkeetna and 88 in Fairbanks. I get so tired of people talking to us like AK is always cold - hotter than most of US today!
Temps 80s-90s in Alaska are hotter than anywhere else because buildings are built to retain heat, and most have no AC.
I win - saving it. We've been saving this bottle since December.... Could it be flat?
This man is trying to feed me champagne at 1:45am "it's ok it's extra dry"

Poor guy kept coming in ONLY when we were behind/ahead 4+ runs just in case… and i bet that would shake him up.

@dianewitt but the #1 reason why we are having a real wedding is because we don't have to pay for it... haha
@dianewitt i hate dealing with wedding stuff - the event itself is more for the families than for us, in our case. I'm all about eloping...
Seems ludicrous to spend $400+ on 9 hours, even if it IS *the wedding night* ... and it's insane how crappy some places look for $300
So we might have to spend our wedding night on a raft and float down to the Cook Inlet and wave down the train. #noroomsattheinn

Whine whine whine ;) #nosnow
You know your Alaskan blood has seriously thinned out when you're concerned 63 degrees may be too chilly for outdoor run.
@ElsieSnuffin just about to go - think it's warm enough to run without sweater? #weakalaskan
Wow - meanwhile, in Philly, where Marlins are up 11-0 in the 8th http://t.co/zk1qJLY9JB
Saw 3 actual cardinal birds today - at first I enjoyed it, then I got nervous and superstitious
@ElsieSnuffin just about to go on my run up there!
I love love love it when the boys take an IBB and make em pay. Way to go, @T_Mo12!!
Neither of us were "drunk," but after 1 tequila shot (1st in yrs), ended up falling asleep in strange places at home &amp; have no idea when/why
Best thing about 1990s pandora radio is I have ALL of the music. Really?!
Late afternoon drinks on a roof, baseball, Marlon Brando, '90s-'00s music = distraction from wedding planning. Eff it. I'm taking a shot.
Take on Me playing in the liquor store - i sense a rally
@ChrisSMergerson haha you tell em!
Checking my twitter feed after a Nationals win is one of the best things ever :)
@ChrisSMergerson YESSSSSS
@katiegregerson we can do that because we're girls. I think most guys would cry in a corner if they see him... #yikes
@stephanats yep. Not complaining that it was Chris Davis though.
Jordan Zimmermann, master and commander.
OMG. Second time we semi-decided on a venue and then throw it out. It's April 30 and this thing is Aug 10. #onlyinAKdoyouworryaboutbathrooms
@iAmberJensen haha I do, it's just way too expensive for us, mainly the plane tickets. That and we don't have *that* much time to spare.
@iAmberJensen would be so easy to get to Kauai or Maui from AK, haven't been in 10 years! Otherwise, 30 MLB park roadtrip for 4 months :D
@iAmberJensen thanks! possibly, but we're only home twice a year - might just spend a few days on the Kenai and save up for next year :)
Everyone should sing Rogers and Hammerstein if they get too stressed out. It works.
@Alleycat17 now THAT is dedicated baseball nerdiness :) #jealous
@snowbnny haha yeah, exactly. I was half hoping we could use it for a honeymoon trip, but we couldn't afford much more than the tickets
Call me a brat but I was really, really hoping to spend 40,000 miles on a ticket somewhere new. I guess our own wedding counts. :P
Been stockpiling mileage for over 5 years and had to spend it on a ticket home (to get married, but still). Not an exotic location. :(
Um Astros are all up on the Yankees... @ChrisSMergerson
Neither of which I consumed, but still, a show about advertising - whether the product is real or not - makes you WANT to consume.
I'm a week behind on Mad Men. But last week's episode made me crave ketchup and try ordering the nonexistent Old Spanish. @LaVillano
@IamSauerkraut haha probably. That was over 4 years ago, she must be sad i never called her back....
@ChrisSMergerson @wendipqa wonder if it's kosher to make that my cover page....
Whoops and that I'm engaged to @ChrisBirdsall (whose picture is extremely outdated!), not the other Chris ;)
Should probably footnote that I am indeed NOT engaged to Sarah Palin.
Forgot to share: awkward entrance to the engagement party our friends hosted for us @ChrisSMergerson http://t.co/dlFrlpFxuE
@ChrisSMergerson haha! View of Denali in boy's hometown. Only in Alaska do you worry about outhouses in a wedding dress...
@dieri haha Wikipedia was what I meant ;)
Also: wedding in Talkeetna. Boom.
Baseball nerds: read about Evan Gattis' journey to MLB. No wonder this guy plays so hard.
"If that's an Arctic tern, then this wedding was in June." &lt;-- How Alaskans try to tell what month a wedding took place. @AKbirder
@johnvasquez_ plus the crime levels are At their lowest these days
@johnvasquez_ ha really really not bad. It's all concentrated in SE DC, pretty much. Aside from the ballpark I've never been in that area.
@johnvasquez_ so much to do and  see! It's a pretty exciting place! :)
@johnvasquez_ ha yep. Just a couple of Alaskans rockin the capital for about 3 years now.
@johnvasquez_ wooooo come to DC! ;)
Super excited for engagement party tonight - we have amazing friends and colleagues! So grateful!
@ChrisSMergerson haha you're very sweet :) I had to resist an argument with a troll last night re: whether women "get" sports!
@gimpi @cory907 ha! Root for the franchise that still needs NL and World Series win! Nats beat up on SF last year, interestingly. Have fun!
Oh good. I love it when some ignorant jerk makes an immature comment about my first name. My name is CENTURIES older than the car. #snob
@snowbnny ha that was me yesterday here - always hurts to comb/brush it out, even carefully! :)
@DanEspiBeard Danny had a much thicker shadow just 2-3 hours after that first RBI. Insanity, I say.
A happy happy game. I loved that Storen waved at the camera as he and Mattheus snuck over the cooler to washout Gio.
Darn sponsor
Dammit FP said, "What d'ya say mercedes" - aargh like 70 games of this to remind me I have an annoying name
On the bright side, it was a well played game. Haren still has some kinks but Desi's defense is back, and welcome Rendon!!
Omg make that impeccable top of the 9th worth something!!
New plan: Denali Park wedding. We will get this venue settled in the next 8 days! But this is the most excited/confident we've felt yet!
Maybe it was Tom. Didn't see the face. But seriously wish I high fived one of them!!
Nats mascots Abe, George &amp; Teddy doing some serious dancing with a DJ in front of Union Station metro escalator. Amazing Monday surprise.
@johnvasquez_ Nats/Mets - back and forth battle. Haven't watched the whole time, but very time i checked someone else was ahead
Quite the game eh
@wendipqa woooo! Fairbanks, Juneau, Talkeetna - so complicated!
@katsylver don't even know what kind of wedding we want. I'm the only one who wants it in JNU. Dreamed of that since we met over 4 yrs ago
@katsylveri I just want the party :(

Hahaha loved @thisisdspan - laughed like he knew Carp was having another calling fail (not to mention camera guy). Thanks for getting that!
@AKbirder radar shows it weakened, they'll cancel watch 2 hrs early. Potomac keeps storms in DC more mild - outside DC are usually stronger
But at least there's baseball, even if it is a sloppy 1st so far....
@AKbirder yep - keyword is watch. We've had maybe 3+ dozen of those since we moved here nearly 3 years ago, never a warning - so that's good
RT @timcraigpost: A bit surreal.. Local DC news having to break in with a tornado warning special report, overriding national news special …
RT @ElsieSnuffin: Let's hope this DC downpour washes away all the bad of this week and leaves only the good.
Dear lord i think lightning struck another tree in the neighborhood
Remember kids, it's ALWAYS campaign season whether or not it should be and regardless if you hate it. Just understand it as reality.
@dieri bomb squad in our building and on the news... happy times.
seriously can we just go home
UGH evil people are making me so nervous. But for every evil person out there, there are tens of thousands of good people trying to help.
JZimm makes me smile - great work. And @T_Mo12 needs to start more often - every time he does he does amazing stuff!!
Sooooo glad @T_Mo12 is starting tonight; and we know why
@katiegregerson haha I love FP and carp so much.
Today more than ever, I will not let a wee bit of sleepiness keep me from running. Dedicating my run to Boston tonight, with love and hope.
RT @jrlind: nothing up at globe or cnn yet. looks like twitter is your go to at the moment. #bostonmarathon
This Bob Costas special on the movie 42 is killing me - need to go see it!!
@ChrisSMergerson ha i think you did jinx it
@ChrisSMergerson blah.
Yay! Ray Knight waved at me! So worth it.
It's April it's April it's April
Yeah. So much for being good luck at the ballpark today. But it's APRIL. fear not.
Greetings from the 300-level of Nationals Park http://t.co/qZqB1ff5ya
Our pal @T_Mo12 needs more ABs
Ugh-la doesn't make plays like that.
@Natituder hahahaha
It's soupy out there - muggy air is difficult for some pitchers to grip a ball. Uggla might not have been up at all.
everyone says the weather isn't HR friendly, so Storen was lucky. If it was HR friendly, Clipp might've been able to grip ball for 3 outs
Oh clippy! And the Yankees pulled a triple play...
Ha Davis threw his bat in a hilarious way. But maybe we're just dorky. #masnsurfing
Haha and ALL of my Nats tweeps say the same thing. Love.
Player of this game = the guy in beige long sleeve shirt. Good move, buddy. Don't be "that" guy.
@dieri yeah! It's real! And lightning actually struck and crashed a giant tree within a few blocks of us - no wonder it was crazy loud
I have a legit fear of showering during thunderstorms. Good thing it's Friday and can be a bit late.
@cdorobek glad i saw the lightning first or else my heart would have jumped out!
@alaskascott thanks for your hard work!! Get some rest!
First thunder of the year just woke up everyone in DC who wasn't awake yet. Good morning!!
@ChrisSMergerson oh! And Brandon Phillips is amazing. And the entire Nats team (can't choose a favorite) :P That's 7+ players in 5 tweets :D
@ChrisSMergerson and some veteran players I highly respect: Torii Hunter (16 straight seasons over .300!), Dickey, Piazza, Ivan Rodriguez
@ChrisSMergerson Mariano is also in there. Finally saw him in person here at the exhibition game, I was just dumbfounded. Absolute legend.
@ChrisSMergerson cliff lee is up there too; he just plays for the wrong team :) I have many up and coming favorites that are still young...
@ChrisSMergerson Pedro Martinez is my all time favorite. Goofy, power pitcher with unusually small stature, incredible record-setting talent
@stephanats I'm not mad!! So glad we tuned in for this inning, love watching those guys!
@ChrisSMergerson 5 runs - blew a 2-run lead! Kaboom!
5 runs in the 9th take O's from down by 2 to up by 3 - Hanrahan blew it
SOOOOO glad i switched to @masnOrioles
@ChrisSMergerson tell me you switched to the O's game in Boston!!
@ChrisSMergerson yeeeeh I just meant a garden variety little popup to cool the air down :P
@ChrisSMergerson i WANT it to storm tonight, just a bit. Already cooled to 77 outside though. Still 83 inside.
RT @MLBMeme: With only one win, Marlins fans have to come to games in disguise http://t.co/rzQIw9DNJj
@chrissmergerson @dannyvernon ha.....
@ChrisSMergerson second deck! Floyd is pitching well though @DannyVernon
I love that we'll be supporting so many Alaskan small businesses with the wedding :) maybe even one in Delta!
Seriously hating that Mercedes Benz sponsors the Nats pitch track. Every time they say "Mercedes will track it" I get thrown off....
Except the metro! Huge crowds!!
Immigration rally has been LOUD all day - yet I've never seen them
On the bright side, temp cooled down 13 degrees from today's high already
Clippy........
ROOOOOOCHE i called that 10 minutes ago - first hit of the year a 2-run bomb
Yep i just yelled BOOOOM crazy loud
RT @cnichols14: #Nats silver slugger LaRoche has .000 batting average and starting pitcher Gonzalez has .750. #WhenYouKnowSeasonIsYoung
@jtspiv impossible that I'm that nerdy, or impossible that someone would make a mustache account for a pitching coach? ;)
@johnvasquez_ word - our winter was kinda long here, by DC standards, and i knew craving warm weather would bite me!
There's gotta be a McCatty 'stache account - he keeps shaving it and growing it over and over. Or maybe I'm just a super #NatsNerd.
Alaskans back home might be complaining about the snow, but at least your building isn't refusing to turn on central AC with highs near 90
You know you're from Fairbanks when you step outside at 83 degrees and expect the smell of forest fires
Like a loyal Nats fan, can't help but smile that Cardinals severely imploded in the 9th... even if it's only April
Haha "we won't turn on the AC until there are no days without lows near 40" - ONE day in the next 10 will be that cool. Seriously?? Do it.
Warmest day since October 24! #sonotalaska

Hahaha carpenter said, "Mercedes on the pitch track!" Wooooo I'm so on that #disclosingmyidentity :P
The boys had to fly late last night, first time in 6 months - maybe they just had crappy sleep.
@WashNatsChick hahaha and tonight we had a baseball/pizza date. Oops!
@needham_chris Votto hit a walk-off salami off Henry last April, in fact. At least we were already down 10-0 this time :P #optimism
On the bright side, phillies lost 13-4 to Kansas City.
Seriously, I'm not kidding, @DanEspiBeard: Grow back the beard of victory. You've got 14 hours, you can do it.
We'll get 'em next time.
@Alleycat17 ooooo say hi to DeRosa for the Nats fans!
If Duke shaved and put on @TylerClippard's sports glasses, might have a hard time telling them apart
@DanEspiBeard grow back the beard of victory!!
I KNEW we should've turned on @masnOrioles. Dang it.
Insane, I say. Who else had 15 RBIs in the first 4 games of the season? Researchers go!
RT @danconnollysun: Chris Davis. You kidding me???? A grand slam on the first pitch. 4homers and 15 RBIS in four games to start the season
Chris Unstoppable Davis - somehow I knew he'd do it, especially on Opening Day. @ChrisSMergerson
@NLBeastNats we knew a guy named Bill Edwards (must be a million out there) and his nickname was Bedwards
@ChrisSMergerson we LOVED that quote at the time, just hysterical - he's so quiet and "modest" haha

@WashNatsChick yeah I'm concerned :( he pitched just fine but something isn't right
Though he pitched just fine
Gio looks like his head is bothering him :( makes me worry it's more than a simple headache
I think I'll step away from the computer and turn on @masnNationals. Nobody is helpful or nice today. :P
In regards to a riverboat as a venue: "Well, we can't do weddings now because the river is frozen." THANKS.
OMG. #weddingplanning #alaskansourdoughs
@nobuhata ugh!! i don't get it! Yet at the same time it makes total sense.
Also, what is with Alaskan businesses and archaic websites and FAX machines… I'm just saying.
Um, step one in trying to sell me your venue: DO NOT BE RUDE and assume I'm an idiotic kid.
@ChrisSMergerson hahaha i JUST facebooked that
@ChrisSMergerson haha of course
Baseball season and wedding planning are now in full swing! #helpmeimpoor
@ChrisSMergerson awesome - then I saw Jaso was at bat and he's one of 2 A's with a hit off Felix. Could expose his weaknesses if he wants!

We have entirely too many pictures, but it was fun. It was 30 degrees colder than the other 4 games i attended this week :P
Scored awesome seats about 7 rows back from the Nats dugout today for super cheap, and saw the legendary Mariano for first/last time.
BOOM @SEA_Beast38 hits a full count 2-run bomb off Kershaw

@kpow17 hehe it's a good February when there's baseball!
Oh the glorious sound of the crack of a wooden bat.
@dianewitt ah yes. Out of our 3+ weeks in AK last summer, spent 10 days in Fairbanks - great weather and NO smoke! Boy is from Talkeetna :)
@dianewitt I know I know this - where do Two Rivers kids go to high school? I went to Lathrop
@dianewitt oh good - when I visited last August it was actually NOT rainy, as most Augusts tend to be there. It was 70+ each day :)
@dianewitt yay! I grew up there. Visit 1-2x a year - always visit AK twice a year, don't always make it to Fbx (family goes to ANC a lot)

@Alleycat17 !!!!!! Really!! I would've applied if I had a blog! A million congrats - and what a great season to look forward to for Toronto!
@jerinkeeley busy and exhausting! Excited for spring - I bet you are too!
On a cold and wet day during a very busy time of year, I take solace in the fact that there are MLB players on a field in AZ and FL.
@jerinkeeley oh no, I promise! :) in fact, I could say "no, I promise" to both of those... ha! Are you still in Juneau?
@jerinkeeley haha you're adorable - no, it's invitation only, too limited seating to allow staffers. :)
@jerinkeeley haha yes! I love all their soups - super good and cheap. There are all kinds of souvenirs with the recipe on it!
Beautiful days for baseball ahead! http://t.co/nIlo6eId
@wendipqa could email/Facebook that one too! :)
@wendipqa she loves it :P I can email/Facebook you the family recipe if you'd like!

@NatsGirl19 I think 2000 was when DVD players were getting popular, yet many still used tapes for years. Know a few who still do...
@NatsGirl19 haha yay! CDs live! I totally have tapes somewhere in my parents' basement. Audio tapes, VHS tapes. Quality, man. ;)
@sea_beast38 did you see the WaPost love? :) plus this is funny: http://t.co/8FZk05MK
@NatsGirl19 yeah 26 (i miscalculated myself - i turned 13 later in 1999). Boy will be 30 in July though, that keeps me feeling young ;)
@NatsGirl19 nobody buys CDs anymore, pretty sure MTV doesn't show music videos anymore. This was only 13+ yrs ago - half my life, but still
@NatsGirl19 oh man, totally had their CD when it was new. I remember thinking Beyonce was the best. Remember their videos on MTV...
@NatsGirl19 I'm getting to that "time" when I notice more and more people are younger than me, haha - ballplayers included. It's funny.
@NatsGirl19 I know!! I'm not even old! I bet you didn't know who Destiny's Child was until Sunday night! Haha :)
@dieri ha! I'm not complaining. It's just funny that his refund is so big it makes my refund sound small. I got $2500 back for 2010 though
@NatsGirl19 January 1999 - had to look it up, but i remember it well. The year 1999 was THE year I first became immersed in pop culture haha
@NatsGirl19 oh lord. I was 13 when that came out.

@TanteF nope, no pets. Hmm come to think of it, we used a febreze candle this week and it's been out ever since....
@TanteF well, my eyes do. Ha. But it's awful. I've been using cold spoons and eye cream (which I've used for 8 years, no allergy) to settle.
@TanteF none of the above - haven't changed any products at all, at least not in the last 6+ months! I look like a manatee in the morning :(
@dianewitt hmm no idea! I'll try it, thanks! We'll wash the sheets too, though I feel like we just washed them... no new soaps either
Nothing i do is different, same routine for years. If anyone else had issues with spontaneously BAD puffy morning eyes, let me know...
8th day in a row I've woken up with crazy puffy eyes, gets worse and worse. I don't feel sick, I thoroughly clean makeup brushes - allergy?
And it's "snowing" again

And yes, I'm grumpy about this stupid little thing on Christmas. I think he says these things to antagonize me. :P

My fever came back with a mission to kill. Ok it's not 104, but it's going up. Urgent Care 1-2 blocks away looks so close, so far away

I just want to know how my night is ending with listening to Semisonic. I mean, really. How did this happen.
@IamSauerkraut hahaha… yes. i did/do mean the band….
But seriously. Smashing Pumpkins.
Getting to that point where hearing '90s music in bars makes me REALLY happy. But I'm not THAT "old"… am i? #semisonicFTW
Truly, I'm just distracting myself that the baseball season is over. ooooooh my life. But truly, very very grateful :)
I pose a question: who has Maurice Chevalier in their iTunes???? #thisgirl #SUPERnerd #variedmusictaste #hashtagwin
@JackoBeam haunted by Nats' walkup music. We're seriously in withdrawal. :( feels like a game should be on. #whine
@ChrisBirdsall i love you!!!!
Who's the jerk that put on "the river runs through it" to kill my buzz
@NotRizzo very very clever!
I'm the only person in the world that spontaneously sings "16 going on 17" damn near habitually - sober. #notsobertonight #rogershammerstein

Beltways be representin' defense with Gold Gloves! Congrats to LAROCHE, Hardy, Jones &amp; Wieters! *Tremendous* job by @IanDesmond20 this year!

Kinda figured Rollins over Desi, but that's ok. Love our Desi.
LAROOOOOOCHE!!!!! BOOOOOM
Three O's with Gold Gloves, first time that has happened since 1998: Wieters, Jones and Hardy :)
Adam jones over Mike Trout for CF in AL! Nice!
Matt Wieters Gold Glove!
Feeling so blessed for being warm and dry with power and water, food and drinks. Many weren't so lucky.
Reports of huge trees down in our old neighborhood just half a mile from us now
People are talking about walking around, but after every single bad storm we hear about trees falling on people. Not totally safe yet.
@AKbirder gross. Make her wash her hands (and food)
@IamSauerkraut I haven't stepped foot on AU in nearly 6 months, but we have power. Heard from your son?
Holy crap I'm SO TIRED OF CAMPAIGN EMAILS. Everyone who is going to donate has done so already. Shut it.
I'm a couple sheets to the howling wind. Not gonna lie. #SandyDC
GAWD it was nice to forget about the storm for an hour. Another round, Don Draper.
Amazing what a couple of old fashioneds, Mad Men, and popcorn can do for your Sandy-night. #winning

@AK_Chick certainly not as bad as lower-48ers think it is. :) but AK certainly has had their share of crazy storms, like that one early 2011

Damn close to 5pm and the fridge still works. BEER ME, Sandy.
@AK_Chick and Alaska has their own share of crappy weather - everyone does, every place is unique.
@AK_Chick lots of people - friends - on FB. Population density makes all the difference in rain and snow storms. And trees!
It's incredibly ignorant and incredibly insensitive. Everyone has their own versions of uniquely bad or good weather. Stop competing.
Alaskans need to STOP bashing hurricane stuff like it's something they know. This is an entirely different setting in every way possible.
Definitely some flurries mixed in with the rain, not like real snow at all, but clearly the air is cold up high
@akswingley ...but no storm surges! No evacuations ordered here. Heard a tree snap earlier... hokey local news is fun to watch
@akswingley winds kicking up, should see 70-80mph gusts tonight, sustained winds of 40-50 for 24-36 hours, 5-10 inches of rain...
@ShondaAK haha well I guess the wind was "only" gusting 40-50 at the time. Gusting 70-80 later tonight :-/
@Hokuboku Godspeed! Hope you're ok up there - you're getting it worse than we are tonight
Got my #Natitude tee on and fleece pants. Wondering when it's ok to start drinking ;) #frankenstorm
@ShondaAK haha this one guy kept running up and down our hill, but I think he stopped right when the huge gusts started
RT @DDOTDC: Tree down on W Street NW. Thankfully no one was in the car. #SandyDC http://t.co/fdzxLAFf
Pretty sure we heard a tree break. Gusts really started picking up in the last half hour - right on schedule.
Now to enjoy some toast while I can… (that is, while I still have power for the toaster!)
No wonder my head has been hurting so bad since yesterday PM - very low barometric pressure. Kinda forgot.
But I gotta say, even though we kicked the Giants' butt this season, they were so red hot at the end that they would've kicked ours back.
Nady didn't even make an appearance in the World Series, did he?
RT @NLBeastNats: Yup RT @DtotheYtotheE_7: @NLBeastNats sad thing is, Nats kicked the Giants ass all season long. And Nady gets that ring ...
Can't believe this intense ride of 2012 is over. All done. Now for trades and contracts and next month's awards. Excited for lucky 2013!
I think we can blame the microphones for how badly that sounded, but maybe it was that bad anyway.

In other news, happy 80th birthday to my favorite poet, Sylvia Plath!
obviously that's not remotely out of the ordinary though, haha
Juneau and SE Alaska have some respectable wind warnings going on right now. Just pointing that out… #nooneissafe
@dieri ?? I don't get that at all
@dieri what?? That doesn't make any sense!
Perfectly beautiful day today, by the way. Lots of people out and enjoying it (and walking around with giant things of water and TP).
It's coming!! http://t.co/7F6RalJ
Our building has great walls, and is great in general, but you can hear stuff in bathroom vents. Doesn't happen very often, but... yeah.
Heading to the store shortly to prep for #frankenstorm - tomorrow should be infinitely worse
@dieri ? That's included
GAWD I'm lazy. Being warned to go to the store NOW, get booze NOW, or else be miserable this weekend. Why isn't there a grocery/booze fairy?

Oye. Need to go to the store TONIGHT before the shelves empty tomorrow. Need food regardless of #frankenstorm - need other thing bc of it.
@pubhealthchris but there's also wine. I don't think beer is appropriate. We have perfect glasses for an old fashioned.
@pubhealthchris haha was just thinking of that yesterday. I want to make old fashioneds!! "Fashioneds" = awkward grammar
Sandy, the unwelcome guest coming to visit. http://t.co/C7L5vQx
Giants have been especially good at working the counts tonight, very clear with the pitch counts for Detroit pitchers (esp Fister).
Culbreth is a beast. Umpires deserve love when credit is due!

@pubhealthchris forwarding on to all the interns just in case ;)

@dieri woooo who are they playing?
Cool thing about DC is the incredible diversity of college gear you see on NCAA game days
Decided to wash my Nats rally towels in case they're bad luck. Also finally washing my visor too... just in case. #120days
I want to go to these baseball conferences SOOOOO bad because I'm a giant nerd.
@iAmberJensen haha exactly. This relief pitcher came on and I just loved saying his name like that....
Sergiooooo
Woooooo
"My name is Santiago Castilla. You killed my father. Prepare to die." That's the face he makes.
UGH stupid. Stupid day. All around stupid day.
@jerinkeeley haha because my job isn't as cool ;) say hi to them for me! Have a ton of fun!

Happy Alaska Day! ;)
@NatsGirl19 haha I know ya do ;) that's why we're cool!
Oh god jayson Werth playing against the Nats in a phillies uniform
Oh MASN. Nats are so young of a team that a "classic" game is from 2 years ago.
"I wanna dress like Kramer." Oh dear god no

Haha, (former) Justice John Paul Stevens was just presented with a bunch of Nats gear. :)
DON'T BOO BELTRAN. Take it from a Nats fan. But seriously, booing anyone only encourages them - not what you want.
Watching this is part of the healing process - we would be at this game here in DC, hollering at the outfielders
like i said,I'd feel like our series loss is more legitimized if Cards take this series.Weird, but kinda makes sense.I don't like it though.
So I like how we tune in at 6-0 and Giants score 4 runs. I'll be ok if Cards blow a 6-run lead and lose by two, but just this once ;)
Not sure if that made sense.
I might be more bitter if STL loses NLCS bc we have deeply beat the Giants. If Cards win, I'll feel like it's more legit. #awkward #irony
@chrisbirdsall “@Anti_Joke_Apple: Roses are red. My name is not Dave. This poem makes no sense. Microwave.”

@dieri ha just distracting
@dieri ha... Nice. Joe Buck is amazing at talking a lot about the sport he's not actually seeing played in front of him.
@cnichols14 my thoughts exactly. Got weepy when I saw the Post's full page thank you ad to Nats, and when I saw Cracker Jack at the store :(
This made tear up. NatsTown. http://t.co/8qoAADK
Ugh not sure the video link worked. Oh well. I'm just sad.
Nats Park during game 4 on Thursday - Morse's late at-bat walk up singalong. And double play groundout. :P  http://t.co/4objXgB
Ooohh it still stings :(
Man. Jeter. Wow. What a roller coaster.
This game is an emotional roller coaster for both teams. Baseball is soooooooooooo painfully beautiful.
Been LONG evident that Valverde 2012 is NOT Valverde 2011.
Consider my raw emotions stirred.
@DFiasco but, as they say, that's baseball! Addicting and heart wrenching, and simply beautiful.
@DFiasco oh yes. Huge waves of support for Storen. Can't blame one guy - he's a machine. Plus the damn umps... my umpire shitlist is growing
@DFiasco BUT we got this. They're built to last. Rizzo/Johnson for Pres!
@DFiasco haha nice. Yeah, you can probably tell we're serious diehards. Never cried over so many boys in my life ;) it was an emotional 180
@NatsGirl19 nice! That's a great thing - a new generation of folks growing up with DC baseball :) we love Nats Park!
@DFiasco nasty pitches from Lowe. After all 4 teams i preferred/love were eliminated, I'm just watching baseball &amp; not rooting for a team :)
@NatsGirl19 ah makes sense, but that's fun! I'm 26, so all my Nats friends were at least in college already and were hooked to O's as kids
@NatsGirl19 oye you must be young :) totally cool though! Love these guys. We moved here in 2009 and happily adopted them as our home team.
@NatsGirl19 I was kinda emotional a few other times, but not close to this. Not remotely close. Black Saturday. I have so much love though.
Fister. Nice.
@NatsGirl19 hahaha I'd probably cry a little bit
Somehow having the game on mute isn't quite as awkward. But I'm not watching NLCS 1. There will be too many clips and awkward moments.
@pubhealthchris and of course: "A baseball game is simply a nervous breakdown divided into nine innings."  ~Earl Wilson
@phillygoat haha I hear ya. Standup triple! Barely even ran
@pubhealthchris I'll text
@phillygoat I'm thinking the baseball gods know it'll be Yankees, and they knew that would crush us even more. Maybe it's mercy.
@phillygoat if there's a cardinals/Yankees series, that'll be the first WS I might actually boycott. Ever. But I have a theory....
@phillygoat haha I'm sure it's not you :) I know, all four of my favorites are gone - not a single one. I was counting on Reds in NLCS too.
@pubhealthchris did you see the quote I posted? Straightup truth.
@pubhealthchris yep. They learned good lessons this year they kept to heart later. They're so young!
And I'm so happy to report my pitiful sorrow to twitter because there are sooooo many others out there like me, many are friends. #Natitude
Layed on the couch in despair ALL day (with a hangover), now contemplating a late night run on treadmill with the merciless TV OFF.

RT @TClippardsSpecs: Twitter is like a wake for the #nats right now.
@dieri baseball heartbreak
I made a playlist for my heartbreak :P
@cnichols14 such an incredible season. Best baseball year I ever had. These boys are young - still so many more smiles and good times ahead!
@cnichols14 reading your feed - we feel exactly the same. If game 4 and most of game 5 weren't so magical, I think it would've hurt less!
BUT HEY Harper is in record books with second most home runs as a teenager with 23.
Awkward moment where you get that email that says your NLCS tickets are cancelled
That awkward moment you wish you didn't follow everything MLB or remotely sports unbiased and want to smash the pictures
Last night = 13 is lucky number. We got this!!!! Rizzo/Davey 2012!!!! 2013!!!! Wooooo
I'm MIA for a while. love my boys, either way. Thanks for an incredible season. If this is the biggest heartbreak of my life, I'm SO lucky.
First big heartbreak. Ever. I must be a lucky girl. I knew last night 13 was a lucky number - has been for 13 years. Next year = 2013.
@dieri google it
@dieri insurance runs
Gotta get insurance
Totally called two different lucky thirteens tonight - lucky pitch 13 for Werth, lucky inning 13 for O's. Boom!!
Oooooooooooo's
Talking about the Nationals DET tonight!!!! Wooooo!!! Most amazing game I've ever attended, hands down
@ChrisBirdsall testing...
Let's go oooooooo's
@IamSauerkraut love that guy! And I did have 4 beers, but in 6 hours - stupid how saucy it made me nonetheless
Baseball crush = Chris Davis. Does that make me a bad person? Pitcher, 1B, and OF - hit 33 HR. And um... etc.
O'Day, ooo day oh day oh daaaay, O'Day oh say oh day oh daaaay
@wigi49 ???? seriously…. no. **SPORTS** fandom is objective. I'm a baseball fan before i'm a team fan, but I have SERIOUS Nats leaning.
Reds/giants series is seriously backwards
@wigi49 I know, but I think I'm more objective than most Nats fans (though just as - if not more - Nats-savvy; happy to prove it)
@wigi49 ugh! But I've been thinking this is Cincinnati's year for a while for many reasons. But... Giants seem to be forcing a 5th game
Been buzzed+ for 6-7 hours, no gonna lie
Seriously teary and still on the metro. I love life!!!!!
So who else is taking leave from work or skipping class to go to DC's first playoff game in 79 years?? Wooooo!

@wigi49 haha! We should figure that out!
@DCyetti ugh!! We almost went on Sunday with friends. Funny you were there.
@lauramwebster wooo! I been awesome lately, but no more delaying - gotta keep it up! And we need to do a phone date, you engaged girl!!
@wigi49 woo! That's all that matters ;) might stop by, we plan on being early! Got the day off.
@wigi49 AK folks?
@DCyetti we didn't get game 5 tix, but we'll seek out a hopping bar to host the madness - Friday 8:30. Dufffy's is supposed to be good.
@DCyetti nice. Got some good Alaska representation at these games. The beauty of this glorious melting pot! Did you get game 5 just in case?
@DCyetti haha! That's awesome. So hardcore. Where are you sitting? We're in upper LF tomorrow, scoreboard Thursday.
@DCyetti zombie apocalypse!! Any chance you're in DC for playoff madness??
Someone yell at me to go put on my running gear. Once I get the gear on I'm motivated, but I need motivation to change clothes. :P
Need word on STL/WSH Game 4 time soon... please.... ugh. I could go, but the other 3 might not if it's during the day again.
@FightinHydrant we should get blue or white towels bc Cards are also red... Cards fans in attendance will wave them for Cards rallies :(
@phillygoat yes, 74-0 regular season, 2-0 this postseason. I think they said that's a record since 1900.
@raschatz didn't make it to 3.5 hours! 76-O when leading after 7! Boooommm
@phillygoat haha nice, i don't blame you. And O's are now 76-0 when leading after the 7th this year. Just amazing. O-mazing, in fact.
@phillygoat haha electric team and crowd! Woooooo
Sooooo jealous of our good friend at Camden Yards tonight. Hope our experiences at Nats Park are equally electric and HAPPY. Woooo!!!
Let's goooooo!!!!!
So sad we didn't make it to an O's game this year. Next year it'll happen! And it'll be electric.
I am so into this game. Beltway needs good news tonight. Oooooo's!!!
@raschatz Ooooooo I dunno.... ;) #keepthefaith
@raschatz only been 2 hours, on pace for the usual 3-hour game
NOT as high stakes and they got out of it quickly, but that was weird.

Chris Davis never ceases to amaze me.

And hey, I'm all about being proven wrong. I'm just not a blind fan. I'm a serious baseball fan with a strong team preference.
Nats aren't WS material this year - most of us know that &amp; won't admit it.They have hard time in hostile atmosphere. 2013 is different story
Seriously dying
I'M DYING!!!!!!!!!!!
In other news, I think the TBS pitch track could be more accurate. Two pitches in last AB were definitely, definitely lower and more outside
@baseballot esp since so many have to sell back their tickets because it's in middle of work day. Lame. I can take day off though! Woooo
RT @Stefmara: TBS just called Jay's catch the play of the series. Nope...Werth's catch yesterday robbed a HR. THAT was more impressive.

Fell asleep on couch after a mini-party = mini hangover = serious need for water. Dear god, it's a bright bad dry place. What is this desert
@dieri :D :D I'm gonna cry at our first playoff game on Wednesday. No matter what happens, so proud of our boys for finishing best in MLB!
@dieri plus Baltimore came from behind and Oakland came out of nowhere with a huge upset. Crazy year. Record MLB attendance numbers too.
@dieri I think you'd be surprise by how many people care! DC team finished with best MLB record, and we have tickets to 3 playoff games!
BASEBALL IS THE MOST GLORIOUS ART OF ALL TIME!!!! I LOVE LIFE!!!!

@redrummy Ha ha, you actually have no idea how funny that is to me
@S_Lombo1 Lombo!!	You're one of our favorites! We were at your debut last year - so excited to see you advance with best team in baseball!
Okay I'm seriously getting sick of all the Sesame Street references on my Facebook feed.
This is one of those annoying days when I feel like I'm annoying everyone
Worst season since 1965, Boston fires Bobby V one day after the season ends. Nice.
We'll be representing AK love at NLDS Games 3 and 4 next week! (knock on wood for game 4) Living the dream!
So giddy this week I can't sleep. Our boys finished 98-64, .605, best record in MLB. And such a great story and club w/stellar management.
These guys need to take a lesson from the Nats about how to party...! Ichiro, this is why you went to NY ;) http://t.co/XBYrzFq
New iPhone and iOS 6 are freaking me out (in a good way). My iPhone 4 was nearly 2.5 years old.
@dieri it's October, sucka. I don't know anything about the football schedule though.
I have my new iPhone 5 in hand and I don't even care - this Rangers/A's upset is so insane
(not free ones, but a HELL of a lot cheapter than what's selling right now)
Seriously pays to be an overt baseball fanatic - getting playoff tickets and offers left and right. Woooooo!
@AKbirder ha it was my morning-after-Nats-clinch-division hello :) and goodnight! Wooooooo
Ran into a friend from High school (Fairbanks, AK) here, then run into a friend from college (Seattle) 20 mins later, both at work. Crazy.

Wooooooooooo
@IamSauerkraut BUT one step at a time. At this point, no matter what happens, I'm immensely proud of our boys. :) :)
@IamSauerkraut yeah, well Boston went to and won 2 World Series very recently, while DC hasn't had one in nearly 80 years :)
Tonight puts me in baseball heaven, and we're not even done yet
Dad got his Nats hat a few days late for his birthday TODAY - wore it all day and he's wearing it to bed. :D
Why haven't I tweeted? Because WE'RE CELEBRATING!!! WOOOOOOO
About to go run off my frustration/excitement/anxiety/anticipation/gratitude/Natitude
@JackoBeam @nlbeastnats I'm considering it... already have tickets for Tuesday
@NLBeastNats @jackobeam word. You guys going tomorrow?
@AdamKilgoreWP both. Already have tickets for Tuesday, considering tomorrow....
ONE!!!!!
@AKbirder been seeing a LOT of bluebirds or blue jays (forgive my ignorance) lately - any idea why? is this region on their migration route?
I love that every late-Sept/early-Oct, my FB and Twitter feeds blow up with "It's snowing!" from AK friends/family as if it's a surprise.
Yes, still watching. Won't turn it off. And again, a reminder: magic number is 2.
@NLBeastNats we're watching! Kind of addicted to FP and Carp too. Love ALL our boys.
Oh my god. I can't explain how much we'll miss FP and Carp. They're just hysterical and silly and I love em. @FightinHydrant
RT @MarkZuckerman: The #Nats are losing 9-1, but their magic number just dropped to 2. They'll have a chance to clinch tomorrow night.
Thank the lord for the Mets tonight! TWO.
Congrats to Homer Bailey for pitching the first Reds no-hitter in 24 years.
@pubhealthchris Jackson has great history of resting the bullpen this year, can't do it every game. They're well rested, they've got this

What. Is. Happening.
Yay! We can get home after late playoff games. Happy day. http://t.co/z6DnSvn
Some "Alaskans" in neighborhood told mutual neighbor there are NO roads in/out of AK. I'm a 9x AK Highway veteran; that road is 70 years old
Werth = immensely clutch, and a punch in the Phillies' faces. Sit down and shut it, punks.
I mean, seriously. I want to wash off her eyes and show her pictures of 8th grade girls with better taste. I'm sorry, call me shallow.
I don't think it's fair/PC to criticize how successful women look, but I CANNOT stand "Krystal Ball's" makeup everyday. Awful &amp; distracting.
Good lord. David Price tonight: 9IP, 7H, 2ER, 0BB, 13K, 0HR. He's 19-5, which suggests a bunch of no-decisions from lack of run support.
Took me too long to tweet that. Had it on MLB TV. Blame me for the walkoff bc I tuned in when I saw Chipper was up. #toosuperstitious
Ugh. Bottom of the 9th, 3-2 Marlins, and there's a Chipper no-out double, followed by a Freddie Freeman walkoff HR.
@dieri don't have space on my 4 for the new iOS, haha, might as well wait. Selling it back for $170 through Gazelle, so 5 will be only $80+
@dieri haha yay! I should get my new iPhone this week - had my trusty 4 since June 2010! Definitely slower though - haven't upgraded iOS
Just like a few lumberjacks, chopping down the deficit like it ain't no thang.

I don't like Blackberries. Why are they the go-to for work phones? #firstworldproblems
Ross isn't Ross tonight. :(
Um. Yeah.
@AKbirder and the birth was sort of a surprise too. Hopefully her reproductive cycle will be successful again, she had trouble for years
That was a ridiculous play. I love Suzuki.
@AKbirder how sad - they're so fragile when so young, and it's so difficult for pandas to conceive. Just adds to their vulnerability. :(

For inquiring minds, this is what this Fairbanksan now considers "cool" and "feels like fall": http://t.co/hNoEAYK
@FightinHydrant I'm on a mad quest to make "Ballad of Davey Johnson" to tune of Davy Crockett. Look up Crockett's lyrics, it'll be perfect!
Obviously he's a part of it, just as much as he was on his regular off-days. He's in the dugout. And you know they're all just fine.
Hate it when non-DC commentators speculate how Strasburg must feel "not being a part of it." he's in the dugout, earned 15W, PLUS .333 OBP
Giiioooooooo!!! #20 and what is with Akra's Avril Lavigne look?? And insanely huge false eyelashes? Is that a country music concert thing?
So, early on I said it would be nice to have at least 5 runs, and they're basically doubling it. BOOOOMMMM
Somehow I knew Aoki's bunt would result in a bad 9th.
RT @MarkZuckerman: Probably safe to say Davey will be giving the ball to Storen the next time #Nats hold a lead in the 9th. And the time ...
Ugh. Clipp just took out Jackson's dominant start. He's gotta move to setup, I think closer is ALL Storen again. And Clippard knows it.

Helluva pitching duel between Sabathia and the A's Parker - 1-0 yanks in the 8th. Interesting stuff.

Could Drew Storen become the Nationals closer in the playoffs? http://t.co/YwFFSmu
I love our boys!!!! They grow up so fast! A very happy birthday to Lombardozzi and Desmond, and MAD props to Detwiler &amp; Storen. I'm teary.
I love our boys!!!! They grow up so fast! A very happy birthday to Lombardozzi and Desmond. I'm teary.
Also, no ballgames for me ALL weekend. Awesome. :( not even a weekend at all. Nope.

Hahaha ALL of you Nats kids understand. You all beat me to it. :)
Yaaaay Joséééé! Wooooo... weird to say it, but you Nats kids understand.
UGH. Turned on the Braves/Marlins when it was 3-0 Marlines with 2 Braves on and 0 outs. Of course, you know what happened next.
@jerinkeeley haha yeah i think he was asking about Strasburg. Yes, they shut him down 1-2 weeks ago - this was the plan for about 2 years
@TWalkerRivals good thing our office is kind of underground... good stuff out there
@jerinkeeley I don't think Ms are shutting down anyone. Nationals were in the news all year for a big pitcher getting shut down - long story
@jerinkeeley for the Mariners? Haven't heard about that - have to look into it!
@vickiorion thank you! Crazy sale on lamb. Seared in garlic, rosemary, salt and pepper, and splash of dry white wind. YUM! Been a long time!

@AKbirder THANK YOU - totally didn't catch that, no I'm going nuts! Zoo is free admission and just a few blocks from us, it'll be INSANE
Been sitting at 89 wins for like 4 days. Still best record in MLB, still only team over .600 (.614). Just sayin. #knockonwood
@JackoBeam not to mention their insane number of runs early this month! Plus you don't get the best record in baseball without hits!
@JackoBeam word. I've got my rally sneer on.
Even though I'm glad to text family/friends back in AK when Nats are on ESPN, I'm convinced ESPN jinxes their games.
@NatsGirl19 (live, that is - seen Stras and JZimm the most, Jackson twice, and I don't think we've seen Det at all)
@NatsGirl19 woo! Got tickets for Oct 2 when he'll likely start - won't be in town for his next home start. Haven't seen him pitch since May!
@wendipqa @vickiorion L'Shana Tova! :)
Meanwhile, Reds and Marlins are in the 10th and a bunch of crucial games started - Cardinals already up 2-0 in LA
Ha until the field goal. Not tied. :D #iswearimcool
And with that, Philly ties it with 1:55 left. Adorable.
I impress myself watching football - I don't think I give myself enough credit for what I know! #baseballmyfirstlove
How are the replacement refs faring elsewhere? Seem pretty clueless and scared in Philly.
@jerinkeeley better this year, but still (as always) last in their division. The DC team is THE best team this year, so we're obsessed!
A "not in service" bus had "RG3" displayed as their route number. ;)
@dieri you could also tag that with #sexistassumptions ;)
I always seem to surprise people when I know what wide receivers and running backs do.
Hey look, I'm interested in football games today! Until 8pm, anyway. People accuse me of being a hater, but I'm really not!
@dieri haha the network website, silly ;)
@dieri it's on their website, it's not illegal! ;)
@murber74 I'm hoping for another too - might try to catch the dodgers when they're in town next week
@murber74 GIO! Won't be here for next home start, but got tickets for Oct 2 - presumably his last for '12. Only caught him once back on May.
I LOVE that I can wake up early on weekends. Makes work week so much easier. in seattle next weekend for a wedding - i'll wake up at 5am. :P
@murber74 have you noticed O's and Nats have been winning/losing on the same days lately, last week or so? I think, anyway. Weirds me out.
Downton returns tonight!!! Should be up on ITV's website after it airs in UK. Woooooo!
Also, I love jalapeños.
Didn't want to go to another against Philly, but Oct 2 may be my last shot to see Gio again this year bc of my travels and their away games
Been noticing O's and Nats mirroring each other for at least the last week or so - hope that's not the case tonight
@JackoBeam he always looks like he's about to hustle or tackle someone
RT @NLBeastNats: The Fox announcers said it was a "close call" at first. What a joke
Gotta hand it to Perez though, that kid is great to have around.
@JWerthsBeard I prefer Marvin Hudson - and Tim Timmons, for that matter. And So my umpire hit list grows.
Would there be a Davey conference? Would he even give it if it were a MASN game anyway? That umpire makes me sick.
Ok, watching Mattheus explode in the dugout made me tear a bit. Call me emotionally invested.
Umpire derailed the Nats' mentality - boys gotta shake that off. If the stakes were higher, I'd cry right now.
Oh for crying out loud
Already had it out for Tim Timmons for a blown call at home back in May, happens to be at 3rd. He had another bad call elsewhere this week.
RT @KarlJPotter: Nats 4, Braves 3, Umpires 1.
Davey NEVER comes out unless he knows it's a legitimate reason, and every umpire knows that - widely known fact, they say.
Seriously you can't eff with this. NOT COOL. Shouldn't be tied now, £=&amp;@!?!/?!¥=_+&lt; umpire
Davey's first ejection of the season came on an umpire's blown call. Everyone knows he was wrong - Fox, Braves fans, your mom, everyone.
Freddie got the two most difficult hits to to hit for the cycle; just needs a single and double, only the 4th. I'd be ok if he doesn't ;)
And Freddie is the man for Atlanta today, even if he had a silly error earlier.
Haha my bad, didn't even notice Ross came in for McCann. Ross is the one balding and grayish beard at age 35. But still. ;)
McCann is 28, younger than Boy, and is balding with a graying beard. That's awkward.
Just corrected Dad's baseball history - I feel kinda guilty correcting the teacher, but it's one of those things... :D
VERY impressed with how well this guy has done over 27 months - works perfectly fine, even after dropping a few times - no dings or problems
Had my iPhone 4 since June 2010 -- I think I'm due for a new one. By far the longest I've ever had any phone. And hurray for trade-in value!
@dieri some people also say "life is short, eat tasty things." that's why I eat tasty things that ARE healthy, so my life is longer. Dumb.
@dieri I hate it when someone tells me to eat a cheeseburger. Why? To be as attractive as you? Burgers, fried foods make me feel sick.
@dieri no kidding. How is fatty, greasy, processed, fried food "real"? People who say that eat the most UNreal food of all.
@hh_alaska though nobody would ever consider them abusive, i think i've become severely self-conscious - but no eating disorders or anything
@hh_alaska haha it's not constant . i don't think it's fair to distance myself from otherwise loving, generous parents who work hard.
@hh_alaska best part is getting "jokes" from family your whole life about being fat or having a big butt. THAT breeds insecurity. #size2
My overweight (adoptive) family rags on me for being "thin" (HEALTHY), but I'll never rag on them for being "fat." #mybodymychoices
It's disturbing how much some are "offended" by healthy habits. Maybe it helps them feel better about their bad choices http://t.co/J6sgvNL
Had a Sen. Durbin sighting today. Just thought that was fun.
Eager to build rapport with certain folks at work, not sure how to go about doing that. I feel like my professional social skills are rusty.
@AK_Superman haha, that Johnny... tsk tsk
@AK_Superman Johnny? I don't get it... :) just a corny, very dirty joke... more than 140 characters ;)
Ooooooooo Machado!! McLouth!! Love those kids.
Lannan + defense + bullpen + Zimm + Desi = 89.
Mom just told me a dirty joke. Not sure how I feel about that.
Someone offered us NLDS Game 1 tickets. BOOM.
@alaskahippo haha me too ;)
@alaskahippo haha word! I always describe myself as "urban Alaskan" when people ask me AK questions - I'm not terribly outdoorsy either ;)
@alaskahippo haha I haven't noticed anyone else calling themselves "urban Alaskans"! Great minds!
@realpetermag ranted last night about how much I hate it when people don't take baseball seriously until sept. - also not true baseball fans
@JWerthsBeard (looks like a Zimmerman jersey - at least a cheap knockoff)

@NatsGirl19 haha I think I meant to type chunky, so good work ;) I like dumb jokes!
Um. This ad on MASN is way too long and scary for me not to know what "Pirate football" is.
@NatsGirl19 I know a guy who called his fantasy baseball team last year "Matt Stairs." Random and clunky, but clutch.
@TheMrinella god I hope not. I'm done with the Nats/Phils rivalry this year. Phillies fans are the worst.
Davey has been smiling SO much lately. Makes my heart happy.
Woooo happy birthday Ellsbury - walkoff RBI for Boston against Yankees helps O's tie for 1st again!
Clippy!! Don't scare me like that, boy! Wooooo i've had at least 88 happy days since April ;) hehe
@TheMrinella he has streaks that warrant nervousness sometimes
Somehow I sensed that would happen. Let's go, Clippy - cut em up!
RT @Nationals: RT @NationalsPR: Jayson Werth (2 hits, 3 walks) raises OBP from .388 to .399 in span of 3 hours.
Despite the outcome of that AB, that LaRoche staredown was especially intense.
I love Davey's matchup magic. It's seriously a chess game. He's *easily* a top candidate for Manager of the Year. Makes my heart happy.
Davey is working his matchup magic. The true baseball fans understand these things. Mike Gonzalez didn't like it though.
@FightinHydrant RT @RallyNapkin: FP Good Work, Clapper was holding the #Nats back! #RallyClapStopping
@TheMrinella hahaha brilliant
"most" clutch, rather *
Tyler Moore!! He was due for another über-clutch hit, possibly his kid clutch. Beastly.
Hahahahaha @FightinHydrant is the hero of MASN fans everywhere! Wooooooo! You know that kid is going to clap more now.
Guarantee you that menacing clapper will have a parody twitter handle by the end of the night
Omg. That dude clapping seriously needs to stop, or the MASN mic should move.
Allow me to reiterate: I find it very disrespectful and tasteless that cable news channels insist on replaying real time footage every 9/11.
Observed the setting sun on the in tact Capitol Dome. Even through tragedy, there's always so much to be thankful for.
@wendipqa indeed! Extra, I'd say. Never saw those guns before, seems like more bomb sniffing dogs are around.
Good lord. Every time the cable news replays 9/11/01 footage, the terrorists win. This is just tasteless.
Nice to go to work and be cheerfully greeted by officers carrying machine guns. I blame the terrorists.
My favorite thing about "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" is that it's about a woman who wants all her beaus to take her to watch baseball.
@AKbirder also, this long, unemployed summer gave me lots of time, haha. Working in an office full of Alaskan Nats fan helps too :)
@AKbirder hehe :) I could talk baseball for hours. I impress 80YO diehards in our building. Does he subscribe to SABR(.org)? Amazing stuff.
@JackoBeam I know, my newsfeed has been vastly improving as the season goes on. Enough to outweigh the football tweets ;)
So grateful to Dad for teaching me so much. I think my heartiness has been a way to stay close to him through cancer battle 4000 miles away.
@phillygoat yeah my folks reported something similar - gotta love Alaskan autumn!
Sometimes I scare myself with how much I love this game. Not just our team,but entire game of baseball. It's such a beautifully crafted art.
@IamSauerkraut haha good for you. Kind of a bummer though. I have some silly stories about them in Nats park. Epic Phils/Nats series in May
@IamSauerkraut their fans sucked it out of em all season! Serious jerks - went to 5 Nats/Phils games, unlike anyone else. Won't generalize.
@phillygoat Hail and frost?
Hahaha Davey is Beaming!!!! So excited to eliminate his former team (whom he led to win '86 world series). He's been smiling all night. :)
NYM &amp; MIA eliminated,PHI next, then ATL... #knockonwood. I'm a bit worried about 2013 Phils, seem to be going out with a bang despite it all
@phillygoat haha thanks, now to pay off my 2 very expensive pieces of paper! Just hope we can afford postseason tickets! How goes it there?
@phillygoat ended grad classes in April, started my job 2 weeks ago - we've had lots of time to know our guys here. ;) #obsessed
@NatsGirl19 @danespibeard about time! His beard is so erratic and moody!

So I guess we're seeing Bob Dylan on November 20
Yikes. Almost forgot that I have to apply for the FNSB absentee ballot separately from the general election ballots. Whew!
You know, Nats had 73 runs in the last 10 games. And they're still best MLB team. I don't get Nolasco and why he gives them a hard time.
"Had a nice little rain delay: got a little massage, changed clothes, had a chicken salad, and uh tied it up, so yeah, it was well written."
Dammit!!!! It's gone forever. It was hysterical though.
Dammit the sound didn't work at all on that
Oh my god. I think Werth is my new favorite Nat. @JWerthsBeard http://t.co/hgc49ew
@NLBeastNats @thebrowncoat just remember who's been fighting since April to have the best East/NL/MLB record... ;)
Marlins were eliminated last night. Nats are the division/NL/MLB leader. Yet for some reason, the Marlins are always good against us. #irony
Why is it that the Nats and O's are literally mirroring each other this whole weekend....
But apparently 88 yards is cool. I do know that. I know more than I let on, actually. ;)
All I know about what to do in football is yell when someone runs and yell at a man pile.
RT @cnichols14: #Nats Adam LaRoche batting .467 with 6 HRs, 11 RBIs in first 8 games of September. On Fire!
Already got my run in - "cold front" made it my first run in DC in mid-60s in months! Woo! Leaves are barely starting to change too!
This is too much: 2 football games &amp; 2 baseball games we care about are on at the same time, AND it's insanely gorgeous outside #lifeistough
Pretty cool the Washington Post issues a new "chapter" every several months to detail the Civil War's 150th anniversary through 2015
I want DC snow (obviously, not now but in a few months). Enough to make the Mall &amp; everywhere beautiful, but not so much to cause insanity.
And that's what I have to say about an insanely clutch double play for that Baltimore game. Woo! That was an intense inning.
Just answer me this: why does "SyFy" obsess over airing crazy bad shark movies?
@dieri agreed, had our wine last night
@dieri but yeah, my adrenaline was so crazy from those storms coming overhead and causing HIGH drama I was shaking. Good times! #beer
@dieri haha it's Stephen Strasburg. :) I could go on about why he's a big deal, but you don't care, which is totally ok :D
@dieri tweeted that picture 20 minutes before we saw a rotating cloud, had a flash flood, and 2 tornadoes came close to the city, so... ;)
@dieri ...but I have a feeling you're cracking a joke and don't actually care. ;) this has been the plan after his serious surgery 2 yrs ago
@dieri ugh I'm so tired of explaining this to people outside the fan base. National news (incl ESPN) has NOT been reporting it accurately...
Bad weather happens everywhere, of different varieties. Sick of the SE AK people laughing at ANC for their windstorm. Agh!!
I know all about that stuff. And you know what? I'm getting a little tired of these "weather wars" in AK and between AK and lower 48.
Crap weather in Ak is more often widespread than here. Also, not even fair to compare anyway. I'm not moving to FAI for weather, thank you.

RT @cnichols14: Yikes! RT @capitalweather: RT @edrubio1006: Oh man. Bad news for the neighbors. Alexandria. http://t.co/5RsGex6d
Finally weakening. But oye, what an adrenaline rush. I feel exhausted and hungry. All of that happened SOOO fast.
@IamSauerkraut not yet -- seems a bit weaker though http://t.co/Cgnz5Y9
@907natalie yes Aaaah insane thunder. Madness. I'm such a weather geek that I knew we wouldn't go anywhere today. NYC had a tornado.
SERIOUS oh sh*t weather in DC. Serious. Red boxes = tornadoes. Plural. Yellow= severe thunderstorm. http://t.co/9nnwl5x
Strasburg will PH in October. I know there's a full bench, but hey, this kid hit this year.Give him a shot to do something in postseason! ;)
@CJCreggConcanon haha I know, it's crazy - though in most public buildings and offices, it's more like set at 40. FREEZING at work.
Strasburg done at 15-6, 3.16 ERA (below 3 before last night), 197 K in 159.1 IP. Thanks for all your hard work! Come back as PH in Oct!
Wow, we were in attendance for Strasburg's final win of the season last Sunday. Saw Stras 5 times this year, and his comeback last Sept.
@CJCreggConcanon ha, good point. Sometimes it's hard to tell when you're freeze-dried from AC to the point that 95 feels good for a while ;)
Many Alaskan friends would probably think that's sill too hot. It's all about acclimation! I noticed September isn't really "fall" here yet.
After at least a week of gross humidity, a few days pushing 90+, and gray skies, this will be much appreciated. http://t.co/YcZhIzK
RT @NationalsDSP: Why would you run on Harper on a medium deep routine fly out? Why? #Nats and #Marlins still tied going to btm 9th.
Those two are effing KILLER together with clutch defense
Aaaahhhhhh #HarperSuzuki2012
Whole new ballgame! Knew the beast was due! BOOMMMMB
Right ^
Wow. You know those O's want this BAD. This is incredible. Hell of a game to be at rig now. (Recording DNC, FYI...)
@cnichols14 I have no words, I don't know anything. Who would've thought THIS game would be crazy?
RT @cnichols14: I'M GLAD I BROUGHT MY CAMERA TONIGHT!!!!! #Nats #Cubs #FightNight
Harper better control himself if he doesn't make it on base. He's unbelievably (and understandably) wound up. Extremely.
RT @cnichols14: RT @NationalsDSP: Clevenger swung at Desmond, which is why he gets tossed. #Nats #Cubs
@AdamKilgoreWP umps were extremely, extremely kind
Insane brawl. I have no idea what's happening. The Cubs are seriously, seriously a bunch of PUNKS. Nothing in it for them to start BOTH.
RT @AdamKilgoreWP: Intentionally walking Adam LaRoche in the third inning is such a loser's play.
@realpetermag gawd, another would-be-decent trade that ends up not hitting. Maybe he'll be like Beltre and go crazy after he leaves.
@FightinHydrant do you tweet during plays? We always speculate when you're quiet for 1-3 minutes, you're eating a giant chili dog.
@FightinHydrant oooo harsh ;)
Thought about switching between games on treadmill again, but based on both games' craziness &amp; my reactions, good thing I'm not in public.
@realpetermag haha thanks :) it's a crazy feeling, having lived in Seattle for 4 years! but Ms - seriously not bad this year. They're due!
@realpetermag I'd tattoo it on my face if they went all the way... #dontholdmetoit #knockonwood
Suzuki, I can't believe it. He's ripping it up the last week or two. Coming to DC in August, he was batting like $1.60 or something nuts.
Baltimore &amp; DC finally have spirited fans rooting for the home teams again. This season is insane in Beltways - historic! So glad I'm here.
Fuuuu my bad. Weiters, not JJ - could've sworn they said Hardy
This whole Yankees/Orioles series is basically a playoff situation. Speaking of which - BOOOMMMMM, JJ!!!
@murber74 but during Boy's birthday (July) I an excuse get to treat myself too ;)
@murber74 baseball is "my" pro sport though. I appreciate all sports, but all of my sports brain power goes into baseball. :) #truelove
Who else would do that? Seriously??? Looooveeeee
Bryce Harper makes cheetahs jealous.
RT @NLBeastNats: This kid man. This kid... a hustle triple?!? Unreal
Funny the Nats didn't hit during that 5-game slump, now 102 hits in last 8 games with 22 home runs. What did Davey give them?? ;)
@murber74 Woooo! Happy birthday! Wish I could have a baseball birthday, but I'm in November. :( enjoy!
@TWC_Shawn I still have yet to read about the weather facts, timeline, etc. I guess Interior AK is supposed to get some bad wind now too.
@TWC_Shawn wow! Didn't expect a non-Alaskan weather person to respond. :) sounds like a big mess still, according to family/friends
Has anyone heard about serious injuries or deaths in the ANC windstorm? Just curious - though I haven't read much of ADN, et al
Too many Alaskans say, "So glad I don't have to deal with crazy storms or hurricanes" -- maybe it's karma.
@dieri haha good work - but I said "active" :D except that's "Piazza," hehe
@dieri haha, i bet Jeter is the only active MLB player's name you know ;)
@dieri hahaha you're terrible. That's a call to the GM (general manager) anyway ;) #nerdsknowthesethings
I'm not stealing it, but it's good to know where it is, because you know, I'm important and stuff. #notreally ;)

Nats are hitting 2 home run derbies in a row: 6 home runs last night, again tonight and only the 7th with no outs. The Cubs' pitchers blow.
Word!! MT @LukeRussert: No joke, if it lasted to 7th, I was going to drive NASCAR style to Nats Park. God bless Gio, he'll get a NH some day

@dieri haha I meant slow day at work, hence my having ESPN on... woo!
Ugh. Now someone had a cockroach. This building scares me - it looks so clean and it's so historic, but roaches and mice don't care
In other news, ESPN sucks today in general. #notafootballfan #slowday
I hate that ESPN canNOT understand that a pitcher who pitches 6 innings once every 5 days is not the #1 reason for the Nats' awesomeness.

On a quest to get my folks to visit for the first time since we moved here 2+ years ago. Mom hasn't been to DC since she lived here in 1971.
@wendipqa ooo but that sounds delicious!
Ultimately I want this random bout of humidity that Isaac brought to go kick itself in the face.But DC isn't as humid as often as many think
I'm ready for sweater weather. Not quite wool-coat-weather, but you know - fall. Of course, "fall" here = 60s and a lot of colors. #awesome
@jessejoseph haha pretty much anything inside a tortilla and called a "burrito" is awesome, for some reason
Sam Adams' new Oktoberfest is their best yet, I think. It's a terrific amber, too bad it's seasonal. And I've been on an amber kick lately!
@cnichols14 yay! I hope so. Should get rained on - Isaac remnants on their way from the west (humidity!!). Hopefully nothing too disruptive.
@cnichols14 great, thanks :) We're sitting right above the bullpen. We'll try to get there early for the scheduled signing stuff too. #nerds
@cnichols14 if I gave them a heads up in the bullpen and toss down something to sign, would they do it? Seen it in the visitor's bullpen
Isaac's remnants are coming for us, and we have a ballgame to attend. This means warm, humid, wet, tropical conditions. Woooo! #embraceit
...which is seriously saying something. I just need a hobby. Hoping SABR makes call for papers I could do, and do crazy data analysis. #nerd
Also, now that I'll have much time on my hands from Sept 22 until the Dec/Jan holidays, I'm on a quest to be the ultimate baseball nerd...

@NHinAK Not a crazy idea. Makes me worried about my kids that aren't even conceived yet. This guy looked so ordinary, clean and "nice."
Several other things indicated what happened. It was very disturbing. Parents, no matter where you are, this shit happens. Pay attention.
Pretty sure a friend and I witnessed a man lure a 3YO from his parents. No joke - mother yelled, "Who is that?!" and the kid ran back.
@mariancall makes sense.There are a lot of good places that aren't downtown (like what I mentioned), but I don't know many venues in general
@mariancall bummer! Have you checked out Rock and Roll Hotel DC? I think they do lots of indie gigs, often $10 shows
@mariancall (the main problem would be getting home on the metro at night - gets sketchy, and limited hours)
@mariancall I live in NW DC,both places take 1+ hour by metro. I have a car, but still a pain. Looked into DC venues? You have many AK fans!
@mariancall ooooo I got all excited when I saw "DC" and it's Silver Spring on a Sunday night! Wish I could make it bc you're awesome! :(

I start my new job on Monday and I'm still stuck on Alaska time. Any tips for snapping out of it? I'm not a fan of "sleeping pills."
@wendipqa spontaneous dancing with wine in hand is one of my favorite activities! :)
And YES still on Alaska time. Aaaagh!!! Need to get over this - start my job on Monday.
Nationals are the only MLB team with less than 50 losses now, just so y'all know: 77-47. Don't forget who's on top.... #ESPNfail
'Tis that time again when Frank, Dean, Tony, Ella and Billie grace the living room along with cheap wine and bad dancing.
@dieri "bust" is the proper term ;) Bust-waist-hips. I'm def retaining water right now so I bet I'm 34-23-35, i'll have to check in AM.
@dieri How's this for honesty: I haven't measured in a while, so I went and did it because I was curious. 34-25-35.
@dieri I do know what 31 means! Chris used to be a 36 when we started dating 3.5 years ago, now he's a 31 himself. #itakefullcredit
@dieri Ha, well my size is considered "widely desirable" - petite, small waist, AND I have a butt! I think Flares distract from curves.
@dieri Haha, I was thinking more like the skinny- or straight-legged jeans. I don't see the trashy low-cut ones as much.
@dieri Ha! I love my body. Size 2 with a curvaceous butt. I'm not jealous. :)
@dieri they remind me of middle/high school (and college, for that matter), &amp; they're not terribly flattering for most people, I'm noticing
Girly question: Does anyone wear flared jeans anymore? Or even bootcut? I rarely see them worn anymore, but they're still selling them.
Cold, juicy, giant green grapes are ridiculously good after running on pavement for 45 minutes
...and obviously, with the lowest team ERA and opponent average in MLB, Stras isn't the only good pitcher on the staff. K I'm done now. :D
I'm just trying to fill the ESPN deficit since nobody outside of DC sports seems to be informed - ESPN only talks about Strasburg shutdown
Nats have 6th highest OPS at .734, behind 4 teams they've defeated in series, and STL, who they've yet to face (which should be interesting)
Did you know: Nats are 77-47 (.621) and best in baseball and have the lowest TEAM ERA *and* opponent batting average in MLB. #ESPNfail
Ha, just randomly found a picture I took of then-Gov. Palin with Denis Egan after appointing him to state senate in '09. Crazy times.
@Alex_Keck or after the 6th, anyway. He also seems to weaken then too, but not all the time.
@Alex_Keck YES. It would be great for this year especially as they try to conserve him. He's consistently pulled in the 6th.
OK, I'm a big believer in the Stras shutdown - experts are experts for a reason. But I do have a fantasy of him being the playoffs closer.
Of course, after everyone talks about Strasburg's wicked 5th, there are a few hits in the 6th. :P #superstitious #knockonwood
@Alex_Keck funny - wonder if the psychology is he feels more relaxed, or feels like he has to "prove" something? Either way, YAY!!
YES!! RT @cnichols14: I just won a beer on a bet with guy behind me that @jesusfloresn26 would hit 3-run homer! I believe in my boys! #Nats
RT @KevinMcAlpin: Jesus Flores has 4 HR this season...3 of which have come against the #Braves.
Heeeeyyyyzuuuuuusss!!! Is it me or since he's been back as "backup" catcher, he's been hitting better?
Strasburg is a machine tonight: 10 Ks in 5 innings.
RT @Nationals: It doesn't always have to be pretty! #Nats have an @MLB-best 76 wins, and here's how it happened: http://t.co/3HAHKOM0
13th inning win! Sloppy inning by Braves, we got lucky. Jackson was warming up for 14th. Espinosa looked confused when he came in :)
Woops - meant 75-46. :) this is their 17th extra inning game, for what it's worth - and they're 10-7 in extra innings season.
Nats are 74-48, best overall MLB record, in case anyone doesn't know - evidently ESPN sucks at telling people. Braves are 5 games behind.
Bernadina already PH. Still have Flores, Lombo, Tracy - I think DeRosa is still on DL? Who else on bench? 17th extra inning game this year
Three pitchers left in the Nats bullpen (Clippard, Stammen, M. Gonzalez). Talk about LaRoche pitching if necessary, but Moore already PH
Hehe Mom can email from her Blackberry but didn't know what to do with a link in her email. So cute.
OH dear lord. Really wish people wouldn't post close-up pictures of nasty wounds on Facebook, they show up so GIANT on newsfeeds. Gross.
I hate money.
AT&amp;T charged me $60 of data overage even though I changed my plan in time, and then they issued me $85 credit. Win!!
Oh boy. On a mission for a Potomac Mills and IKEA run down in Woodbridge - might have to get up crazy early.
Watching Twister during massive downpours. Kind of awesome. Not that it's severe weather, but the dark clouds make a special effect.
Pumpkin Ales and Oktoberfest beers are out? It's still summer outside!! I hate that they're never around in November. We might hoard some.
So now it's back to FB updates, texts and tweets that keep in mind all m Alaska friends and family are 4 hours behind. ;)
Loved this trip. Could've been better in some ways, but it was among my favorites - terrific weather (sunshine &amp; 70s) nearly the whole time!
Feels strange but SO good to be back in our very own bed again. Slept in 3 different towns in 12 days, as usual during our AK visits.
Hazy in Seattle - could definitely see smoke from up high. In the airport you can barely see the Olympic Mtns - hot (90) and clear day.
@wendipqa haha where was it?
Final night in AK until the holidays -- at Villa Nova. Sometimes I wish family were closer.... ;) #spoiled
Man. And they say Alaska doesn't have traffic jams. Minnesota Ave at rush hour is respectably awful.

I am an absentee ballot hound. Early voting is going for the August 28 primary, Alaska - get there. I get to do it in person tomorrow!
Or was it only the second this year? Can't remember. In any case, boom.
First for the Ms, second in Safeco this year, 3rd for the season - what a biggie. And it's actually a team follow, ha. I got teary.
Wooooooooo FELIX
So yes, I'm on my last leg of the Alaska summer journey. Spent last night in Talkeetna, Anchorage until we leave for DC on Friday morning.
The Alaskan sun is respectably warm. Only 70 in Anchorage, but the sun feels giant. I guess we're closer to it, right?
Nice thing about Alaskan summers is you can leave on your 5-hour drive around 3-4pm and still have plenty of daylight! Thinking about it...
@RandomAlaskan @akbirder @stonekettle @thc1972 like I said, just noticed them flying, hehe. good to know.
@Stonekettle @thc1972 watched some cranes fly overhead too ;)
Leaving town tomorrow, I shouldn't be pissy at them. At least the laundry here is free :P
Also, I feel like a jerk for getting pissy at my dad for totally screwing up my clean, sensitive laundry....
Bloody hell, it's hot inside. I hate that it's always hotter inside than outside here, even if the high was only 73. Dumb. #brat #iwantmyAC
I can't believe they're doing fireworks in 5 minutes. It's so bloody light outside. If the sun wasn't behind the clouds, it would be worse!
So you've got nearly the rest of the week to enjoy before it's truly August again!
Funny how AK weather vastly improved to mid-70s when we got here and it starts raining everyday the day we leave....
Also, that picture was taken at 3pm.

@AKbirder that's ok! I bought your book too :) I was VERY impressed with the museum, excited to recommend it! Amazing stuff!
@akbirder headed your way after a quick late lunch! Panda is with me. ;)
@akswingley @akbirder no! I was just thinking about that. Good idea.
Fairbanks: where's somewhere relatively new I should check out? Café, museum, anything?
Commence Fairbanks boredom the next 72 hours. Boy went camping and my only friends here have small babies. At least the weather is nice!
Ha! Just saw a DC plate near UAF. They followed us. ;)
Looking back on it, pretty sure I saw Ann Coulter at Union Station in DC last Wednesday. Hmm.
Going to the fair later tonight around 6-9pm
Hey Fairbanks, I'm at ACRC in case anyone is interested/not busy. Boy is working on stuff and I'm hanging out on my iPad, like a boss.
Awesome to be so happy, so peaceful, feel so loved in every way &amp; smile so much it hurts, just to end the night with gut-wrenching heartache
Alaskans in Alaska always seem so surprised to learn I'm from Alaska too. I'm not sure if I should be flattered or not.
Had our first Denali sighting of the trip! On our way to Talkeetna.
@ak_hepcat @thc1972 @akbirder !! those "little" things certainly add up, that's for sure.
@ak_hepcat @akbirder Good lord. Must be crazy expensive to maintain a rental car company in remote AK, and to get the cars at all.
@AKbirder I'm renting a car in SEA next month for $25/day, could probably find cheaper. AND it would be easier to hightail it to Canada.
@AKbirder You can't even drive out of the area! Maybe it's even higher in the winter to discourage people from driving across the Strait. ;)
And that's the cheap one!
Good thing I don't have to do it… but how does anyone afford that? $200 a day??
Dear lord, renting a car in AK is an outlandish ripoff! Maybe if there weren't insane drivers and suicidal moose on the road….
Never fails that I'm in a bad mood before traveling, at least to AK. Everyone has to complicate what should be so easy. #GoToHawaiiInstead
Every time we visit AK, I'm excited, then everyone has to make the weirdest plans you've ever heard. It doesn't have to be stressful.
Oooof backstroke is crazy. Knowing how tough those turns are - making the turns can easily break you.
@akswingley had some funny phillies fans near us last night, fun time despite the left field wins screwing us. ;) Great to have Werth back!
@dieri hahaha what is that about? And I'm not a Yankees fan, so it's ok ;)
If I go to a Nats game without wearing my visor, we lose. True story. #magicalhats #icontroltheuniverse
@akswingley ugh, http://t.co/R9VvuYM headline is a groaner: "Behind Jimmy, Cliff, Phils can see clearly in DC" - way too cheesy. Haha
@cnichols14 what if they're jinxed?! ;)
Thank goodness - going to tomorrow's game! RT @Nationals: Davey says he expects Zim, LaRoche both to be back in the lineup on Wednesday
@akswingley haha I appreciate you're not mean ;) Cliff was my fav pitcher for several years, saw him Apr 2011 up close. Glad they got to go!
@akswingley also note we're playing without 4 of our best hitters quite suddenly... #excuses
@akswingley that was awful. I could've driven down there &amp; picked up that ball faster. Shameful! Shouldn't have happened to anyone like that
@mariancall This has been stuck in my head all day - preparing for our visit back home! Will you have a show sometime during Aug 5-16?
And I especially love Alaska Coffee Roasting Co. and their amazing mochas! #littlethings
Another thing I'm looking forward to on my visit to AK: I can justify consuming hot coffee beverages. I love hot mochas.
@akswingley BUT I must admit - i was rooting for them in the playoffs last year. I don't hate the Phillies, just some fans at ballgames :)
@akswingley oh they are, they all drove from Philly. Philly fans from Philly are famous for being obnoxious, often worse than Yanks fans. ;)
@akswingley We were at that crazy May 6 game when Hamels beaned Harper &amp; Werth broke his wrist &amp; the fabulous (for Nats) May 5 game #bringit
@akswingley of course not, probably because you don't live in Philly… ha. You'd be embarrassed, they were SOOO awful. Unbelievable.
Call me proud, but you know, we're due. :D
On a quest tomorrow to start a chant at Phils v. Nats game: "Who's in first place!!" Phillies fans at Nats Park are SOOO vulgar #16gamesback

Been discussing with my classy mother about Old Fashions, Manhattans, and Rob Roys. I want to try one sometime, but I might hate life.
@wendipqa it's funny - I think Downton exposes the Boy's theatrical romanticism
@wendipqa oh god I wish - September in UK, January in US. We're watching the end of the second season. Ooooo Branson! Matthew! Ooooooooo
@iAmberJensen legwarmers FTW!!
Downton!!
@iAmberJensen oh me too, I just don't understand hot pink skirts in a professional atmosphere... weird ads in my email today
It's one thing when it's picnic or casual attire, but professional attire? hot pink skirts? why??
Yuck, I hate how many crazy BRIGHT colors are in stores right now - never saw anyone wearing hot pink skirts and lime green pants to work.
@ChrisBirdsall HEY. I am crazy about you and you're my hero. Thanks. :D
Happy happy happy happy Monday!! So happy. Hope you are all happy too!
@AKbirder goodness... I suppose that's an advantage of suburbia &amp; small cities. Not sure when I last saw a Michael's or JoAnne's in the East
@AKbirder agh, I know - it's annoying. I'm going to rummage through basements to ransack some frames while we're back, haha.
@AKbirder @gimpi We're also on a quest for inexpensive Alaskan art - would love to support Alaskan artists, but I'm still unemployed/poor...
@AKbirder @gimpi We'll be in AK next Sunday, probably Fairbanks for the last 4+ days of the fair. On a quest to find stuff for our walls!
@cnichols14 this whole game has felt very weird, like there's some jinxy hex on it. It's so strange.
This game is straight-up weird.
@baseballot jeez, I knew Stras was on the team and Davey managed it - I totally blanked! I think this current Nats game made me silly.
@baseballot woops, just read about it - haha I feel dumb. Let me just say I agree with you. :)
@baseballot I don't know history behind dropping it,but makes sense sincePros are in season;would be big interruption,injury risk in2nd half
To their credit though, it's crazy hot inside homes when it's in the 70s or hotter outside since they're built to retain heat
I love that I'm excited to run outside at 85 degrees and folks back in AK are complaining about the 70s ;) keep up the 70s for our visit!!
Somehow I enjoy running outside at 85 degrees (with low humidity)…. #AlaskanBloodMelts
Somehow I doubt these serious athletes drink all the soda these ads would have you believe....
At least @alaskaair has @alaskanbrewing to make it a bit more bearable. :P
I've probably flown at least 100x in my life and I still hate it. I get so anxious when I buy a ticket, &amp; I'm a mess when I'm on board.
Hoping this blue-man-baseball doesn't jinx us somehow. #rallyblues
Hahaha glad Twitter can inform me that it's MASN that is funky, not TiVo #MASN #smurfs

I WANT A ROAD TRIP AGAIN. A real one. None of that "Ooooh I drove for 8 hours one day" sissy stuff.
Make that 6 *complete* trips (2 SEA&gt;ANC roundtrips, 1 ANC&gt;Mass one-way, 1 FAI&gt;DC one-way) and 4 partial (2 roundtrips btwn FAI and SE AK)
Going through my umpteen-thousand pictures along the Alaska Highway (I've made 5 total trips, 4 partial) - I miss it.
Wooooo
RT @Nationals: #Nats are tied with #Yankees at 59-39 for the best record in @MLB and 20 games over .500 for the first time. Ever.
Golly, no wonder they call Bernadina "the shark"
@wendipqa I've been too busy/tired to get far into Season 4 - watched 2 episodes last 4 weeks :( I was slow to get into it, engrossed now!
And that is why Henry Rodriguez only comes in with 8+ run leads… Oh Henry. Jackson had a great start - and ABs!
@KirkC_ Just saw that - looks like the dates of each season's start/end were fairly erratic. Well good, I've got time to catch up :) thanks!
Mad Men fans: I'm currently in Season 4, wondering when the new season 6 will premiere - I tried to Google it and got lots of spoilers :(
Been craving sunshine and skin damage lately - been too hot, muggy, and/or stormy for several weeks to enjoy being outside. Soak it up, DC!
Breezy, sunny, low humidity and in the mid-80s -- glorious!! It's been a few weeks since we've had this. I can't really complain though. :)

This inning is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!
No matter where I live for how long, when it's mid-late July, I feel like fall should be starting soon. That's the Alaskan in me. ;)
Obviously it depends on the program....
Stuck between "overqualified" and "inexperienced." Don't even know what to apply for anymore. Many other grad school grads are the same....
@rpbriggs agreed! i got teary. I was excited to see him in Arizona last March for the first time since '08 - little did we know...
Standing ovation at Safeco, and Ichiro takes a bow. Base hit for his first at-bat as a Yankee, #31
Ichiro to the Yankees! aljwr9409*#)(#($#$
The only thing that lasts only 1 year is the parking permit, and that's $35 - much better than $338/year as a student w/out-of-state plates!
Ugh. New registration, new title, new license, vehicle inspection = $212. But most of it is valid forever, or 2, 4 or 8 years.
BUT I will keep my Alaska voter registration! I don't think DC has any shortage of left-leaning voters….
@dieri Haha, not quite accurate though… maybe if I ever move back… which won't be anytime remotely soon!
Headed to the glorious DC DMV next week to change my license, registration, title… the 2011 Alaska PFD will be my last, this October :(
Obviously, not because I dislike the guy, but because of the expression on his face. Talk about a conversation-starter. In the bathroom.

Sometimes she hints to all these funny "days" she had in the '60s/'70s and never elaborates. I've always been so curious.
Mom just said she's watching Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, and I quote: "Those were the days." Oh my!
So I guess it's cool we witnessed a PH Chipper Jones home run today....
RT @DDOTDC: RT @SteveRudinABC7: It may be the first time in 32 days that it does not reach at least 80° for a high at DCA!
And especially when this person followed the Koenig kidnapping/killing... obviously Fairbanks is not without bad people.
People with dangerous mental illnesses and the intend to harm/kill are certainly NOT exclusive to big cities. Don't let your guard down.
Friend in Fairbanks said they're glad they don't live in a "big city" as if crazy, dangerous things don't happen everywhere. Ahem.
Sweet solace! The storm cooled the air down to 84, definitely baseball weather. Hope no more storms show up.
After *insane* thunder, lightning &amp; rain (and hail?!), we'll make a break for the ballpark now - game starts at 7. Might be delays later.
@wigi49 it'll be back in the 80s this weekend! :D if only for a few days... I'll bring sweaters when we visit in a few weeks...
Gawwwd getting grossed out by all these injury pictures people are posting on FB. Pictures are GIANT in the newsfeed, especially on phones.
Supposed to be over 100 at the game we attend tonight, but only 82 at the game on Saturday.
@weatherchannel people who say a severe storm "came out of nowhere" when it was accurately forecasted for at least 36 hours #wxpetpeeve
@IamSauerkraut haha that's good - I guess it's just the app being funky. Thanks!
@IamSauerkraut Have you seen and u tweets from me with the name "Akpoli soingo obeye" or something like that?
@IamSauerkraut ha ;) it was weird - i'd click on "my accounts" and that would show up, but definitely everything I've been doing is as AK2DC
And I'm pretty sure the person with my old handle is in Nigeria... how much more random can you get?
Someone took my old Twitter handle... weird. Somehow my app was showing me as Akpoli, by my tweets &amp; feed are showing/saving as AK2DC.
We'll be there with bells on... look for all of us sweating sorrowful suckers on ESPN! ;)
Oog. Tonight will be fun weather for baseball... http://t.co/Kjtg2qZ
@cnichols14 yeah... should be a good pitcher's duel, with close win/loss records and ERAs. We'll be at tomorrow's game with Zimmermann.
.@NotRizzo woops, that's Zimmermann and Gio - Stras is for the Braves on Friday (recall the reshuffled starting rotation)
RT @Nationals: It's a wild, wild time to be a #Nats fan. Here's your look at how tonight's thriller came to an end: http://t.co/0JMwIWXO
This is why it's silly to talk about Wild Card standings in JULY.... http://t.co/BY0Y9Ri
Why yes, that was us you heard jumping up and down screaming like 8 times since the 8th inning. You GOTTA watch these highlights!!

RT @JonHeymanCBS: #nats are tough. 1 good hitter after another. 1 good pitcher after another. i'll be shocked if theyre not a playoff team.
EVERY one of those pitches were low and away, but I guess Espinosa redeemed himself.... Onto the 10th!
I'm not sure which was worse: Carp's over-excited call, or the total fail of that ball to get out of the park. Arg!!
@TheMrinella I'm wondering if Clippard won't close next time - he's been having rough outings lately
@kpow17 do you guys watch Mets games on MLB TV?
Oooo Clippard.
Holy cow, this Giolito kid is GIIIANT. I bet his voice changed when he was 6. #Nats
RT @capitalweather: RT @justingrieser: DC's 6th day of triple digit temps. For comparison, we had 5 in 2011 and 4 in 2010
@kpow17 aww! They've been fun to watch this year - albeit a threat ;) I think they've been one of the bigger surprises this season.
When the Metro A/C is working and I am wearing a skirt, I really don't care how hot it is outside! It's the 6th day this year DC hit 100+
@wendipqa sometimes! Usually only show it during breaks though
Especially when they "prefer" a safe, nice neighborhood with that price... researching the rental market is a good thing.
I love these listserv people, saying they're looking for a DC 1BR apt close to Metro with rent+utilities less than $1000.... #inyourdreams
@kpow17 haven't seen them yet this season! Saw them in last series last Sept. Would like to see Dickey, but then we'd probably lose, haha
Supposed to be miserable weather though. It didn't say that last weekend when I got them :P it'll be awesome on Saturday though!
Got us tickets for tomorrow night's game against the Mets -- added birthday bonus for boy: it's on ESPN, so our families can watch. Yay!
Espinosa &amp; Zimmerman have a chance to hit for the cycle this game: Only top of 6th with one out, and Espinosa needs a HR and Zimm needs a 3B
@TheMrinella question: do you know if there is such a thing as having "too much" pine tar on a bat?
@TheMrinella hahahaha yes!
RT @AdamKilgoreWP: Davey says Ozzie called out Harper for having too much pine tar on his bat. He said Ozzie wanted to intimidate Harper ...
RT @AdamKilgoreWP: Ozzie: "I was just telling him how cute he was."
Making a ton of food today for the boy's 29th. I think I should go burn a ton of calories as a preventative measure.
Thought twitter could give me a hint about Ozzie's frustrations, but not this time...
@realpetermag haha I know - spent 4 yrs there for college.I don't think i noticed how seasons blended there,I was just glad it was warmer ;)
@realpetermag it's more comfortable here than when it's hot in AK (Fairbanks sees 90s): A/C vs. heat-retaining buildings, &amp; no forest fires
@realpetermag oh haha honestly? DC. Sounds crazy, but it really isn't. I love having real seasons again. The summers really aren't that bad.
@realpetermag tweet before that was about DC :) I'm only in Alaska probably 4-5 weeks a year - two weeks next month
But really, it's been pretty dry all year, as far as humidity goes. Next couple of days are supposed to be pretty muggy. Enjoy yourselves.
Everyone who hasn't spent much time in DC thinks it's humid ALL the time - Today is the most humid it has been all summer, and it's only 81.
@AK_Chick awesome! I guess it wasn't just me! If only it was like that in DC... Omg, the capacity for slowness is unbelievable
I LOVE garam masala. It's just so perfectly aromatic, delightful &amp; savory. If you have all the spices already, you can mix some up yourself.
I keep seeing pics of 20s &amp; 30-something-year-old men in Alaska wearing GIANT suits -- I guess proper suit-knowledge isn't very Alaskan ;)
@AK_Chick I got mine renewed at the Spenard DMV on a November Thursday at 4pm 4 years ago and I had absolutely no wait. It was like a dream.
Quick!! Someone make a twitter for Harper's soul patch!
Here's a way to get an Alaska touch in our new home… haha http://t.co/vCXHMLz
Saw a Romney bumper sticker today, near Glover Park in NW DC. Pretty sure that's the first I've seen.
Have an interview, but oye!! I feel like it makes me look like I don't pay attention. I really, really do. Three people looked at it too.
That awkward moment when you notice a typo in a submitted job application :( I am a grammar/spelling/anti-typo freak &amp; that never happens :(
And they say the NL doesn't hit as much as the AL ;)
I just imagined what it would be like if Joe Buck explained geometry to his kid in his sports voice….

Aggh. I hate having pet peeves. Lord give me patience.
Wow, I think it's been well over 2 weeks since I felt the 70s during the day, maybe closer to a month?? Cold front FTW!
@dieri ha obviously it wasn't directed toward you ;) or anyone on twitter
@wendipqa haha sorry, I get annoyed about this subject.... I feel like actively hating a sport is like actively hating a language.
RT @MLB: Jon Hamm watched David Freese's historic Game 6 homer in character as Don Draper: http://t.co/CtqupngQ #CelebrityGame
And that is TOTALLY different from people who just don't care about sports -- actively hating a sport is just plain ridiculous. I'm done now
I hate it when anyone rails against ANY sport for ANY reason -- proves they're ignorant &amp; don't truly appreciate culture, skill, athleticism
Gungho baseball *haters* (NOT to be confused with "apathetic") don't reciprocate bc they are soulless, impatient, &amp; unAmerican. #boom :D
I might not truly enjoy football, but I appreciate the skills required, cultural excitement, &amp; enjoy the sounds and fervor...
Someone said baseball movies are more exciting than the real thing -- you ALWAYS know what'll happen in the movie. That person is boring.
I think I may overdo it on Boy's birthday menu next Sunday, but I know there will be no complaints!

@IamSauerkraut haha as long as you stay hydrated! We still go on runs around 90, but that's our limit.
High of 105. We stayed inside &amp; organized all day, didn't go outside once! I'm cozy in my fleece with the A/C. Take that, 11-day heat wave.

Happiness is finding adorable, size 2 capris I bought in 2005 that fit *amazing* again, and are still in great shape. Aaagh happy vanity!!
Just reminiscing about the David Ortiz walk-off grand slam I witnessed in June 2006 at Fenway Park. That felt like a lucid dream…. #amazing
@AKRyder Will do - we'll have to settle for acceptable/"cheap," maybe get nicer stuff later. We'll make another trip to suburbia next week.
@jmproffitt The lightning was insane… that was the first night in our new place with much bigger windows, it was a heck of a show.

There's going to be a funny picture or two tomorrow night about our new living arrangements. Very silly indeed. Love our new place though!
Kind of high on bleach right now. Wish our soon-to-be-former bathroom had ventilation. #movingsucks
@wendipqa but that was probably the first i've seen in several months -- helps being on the top floor :) they're not dirty like roaches #eew
@wendipqa haha and they're crazy fast. They're nocturnal and eat other bugs, not the worst thing. They like humidity and/or heat.
@wendipqa haha no, their eggs got wiped out with Hurricane Irene last August, haven't seen em in months! Centipede. Harmless, but creepy.
@IamSauerkraut haha nice ;)
I wish I didn't scream when I saw a bug. I hope our neighbors don't think something bad. :P
@IamSauerkraut it's a fancy thing, a freezer... :) still good after 8 months!
Family had a big fishing trip near Homer and they're saving us halibut to bring back with us again in August. Hurray for free, fresh fish.
@wendipqa no good opportunity … and if an opportunity comes, it's always a headshot or I'm insanely tired :P
@EskimoGeek @andregen8 awesome, he is! Won't be in ANC for more than a few days this summer though,but might have an occasion in the future!
@IamSauerkraut Haha. just seems like pics of me are taken when we're drinking or in the sun too long, and always a headshot with my hair up.
@IamSauerkraut if I ever get any, probably on Facebook… but again, only something classy. :) I always look tired though :(
And by "show off," I mean in a classy way. No weird bikini pictures.
Dammit, I really want new pictures of me. I lost 10 pounds since last summer, back to 118, and my hair is awesome. I want to show off. #vain

And for inquiring minds, we're moving less than a mile down the street in Cleveland Park, DC. :)
And with that, I say our first day of packing has commenced! Packed a giant suitcase of winter clothes to join 2-3 other winter bags.

Now it's 81 inside. Our indoor temp is hotter than Fairbanks' outdoor temp (75) right now. At least it's not as humid as they predicted.
Our A/C doesn't do well in the afternoon sun on days hotter than 95. Hope our new place handles it better.
It's 78 degrees... inside. It's 98 outside, so I shouldn't complain too much, but oye. Excited for it to cool down to low 80s soon.
@alaskahippo haha enjoy your truly summery weather! :)
Happy Solstice! We 3 Alaskans are going to a Nats game when it's 95+ at 7pm. Crazy? Maybe, but at least we'll be able to sleep tonight. ;)
@shybullwinkle haha probably - I haven't been tweeting or reading my feed much these days either. :) how's your summer? Happy solstice!
@AK_Chick you're a champ!! :)
@AK_Chick yeah… it should knock it down for another year or two, anyway. :( Thank you for your well wishes! #beatcancer
@AK_Chick finished first round of chemo/radiation Dec 2010 -- different drugs for this second round, started last month. But thank you! :)
Happy to hear Mom &amp; Dad so cheery tonight. More chemo tomorrow for Dad, but he sounded great. Said my Father's Day card was the "best ever."
And it's amazing how there's about 4 hours difference in daylight between there and Anchorage. Spheres are cool like that.
Feeling less grumpy about visiting Fairbanks in August now: couldn't tolerate June daylight like I did as a kid. http://t.co/zyozR1p
Visiting our Alaska family/friends August 5-17. Wish we could come sooner, but oye, those flights filled up crazy fast.
Happy Father's Day -- whether you're a father, you're with yours today, or you're thinking of him from a physical or spiritual distance. &lt;3
Didn't think I had tons to drink, but I guess a margarita, 2 beers, and whiskey/coke is a funky combo. That &amp; I'm a crazy lightweight. #ouch
Not one of those extra-inning games that make me happy. We need more runs -- which are actually CALLED safe!

I finished Season 1 of Mad Men the night of the Season 5 finale.Everyone keeps saying it's a dark, sad season.Is that supposed to excite me?
@DFiasco haha thanks... I had mixed feelings about that NYM/NYY series, we also root for the Os (but Nats have priority)
@IanDesmond20 Perfect day for the NL East! ;)
Perfect day in the NL East if you're a Nats fan like us ;)
Wooooooo Baltimore walk-off! Shut up the Philly fans FTW!
Sweeeep! Crazy game in Boston. Philly and Baltimore are in the 10th, Toronto charged the Braves (still in 9th), Mets and Marlins lost. Yay!
@AKbirder made me sad, knew I couldn't do anything about it. Seemed to be hopping pretty well though.
@AKbirder saw a little bird (not sure what) with an injured foot/claw on the sidewalk. It was hopping around, do those injuries recover?
Why would the Facebook apps and website keep telling me I have a new message when I definitely do not? ANYwhere? Very annoying.
Yep, still in my pajamas at 12:30 and it's already 84 outside. I feel useless. :P
Ha, just saw my first Obama general election TV ad against Romney, hitting him on the MA economy while he was Gov.
@IamSauerkraut haha just the dentist -- he wasn't sure what he was asking for, it was funny. I never made appointments for him.
Boys are so cute when they try to schedule their own doctor/dentist appointments… hehehe
@kpow17 that's what's so funny, they'd visit another one and still refer to each one as "the Smithsonian"… silly Westerners ;)
I love it when you ask a visitor about which museum they visited and they reply "The Smithsonian"... There are like 6 of them
Aaaand the Os just had a nasty inning too.
@washingnats my thoughts too. What a bummer.
Harper should NOT have gone for 3. What a waste. Aaaarrrg.
I love that Tommy Hanson is trending
Yay!! Happy bday! MT @cnichols14: Well a very happy birthday to me! Lombo hits first MLB homer and then Harper hits a bomb. Back-to-back!

I've been telling several about today's madness and they compared it to Turnagain Arm winds &amp; -40F. Um, not the same. They all suck though.
Alaskans -- that is, sourdoughs and those who we born and raised -- apparently have no idea what "severe weather" means
@Alex_Keck haha no worries :) I apologize. Crazy night out there, hope you and yours are safe!
@Alex_Keck ? I was saying it was ridiculous if Nats tried to play tonight, and thankfully they're not. We had tickets, didn't dare risk it!
No kidding. My first rainout! Hope it's rescheduled this weekend, great forecast. RT @capitalweather: #Nats game postponed... good decision

@bikeshare PLEASE revise your last tweet: it is a Tornado WATCH until 9pm. There is a very important difference between watch and warning!
@capitalweather Sun doesn't seem to be peaking out much today, at least in the District -- that's good, right?
DC kids, stay ALERT and be SAFE! No fooling! http://t.co/yq0VDB6
Love this story by @adn_jomalley about the truly Alaskan couple married 70 years http://t.co/FVkOzeV
Ugh, I really hate that our division is within 3 games of each other. I mean, I love the sport and excitement of it, but come Sept/Oct...!!
@kaseynicole ha awesome. I have the time but not really the money right now. Thanks! Boy didn't really have an answer, haha.
@kaseynicole my thing said to change in late December or 53k, just over 50k now and the oil still looks fine. Think I should go anyway?
@kaseynicole thanks! I thought that was about it. It was changed ... maybe last July. I drive like 10 miles a week, on average....
@dieri haha thanks ;)
At the risk of upholding the women-don't-know-crap-about-cars stereotype, what does this mean? #dontlaugh http://t.co/sCeVKIn
@dieri wow, that's crazy -- i bet that's not even legal in the Majors! Thanks!
@iAmberJensen oh man, i bet farmer's markets in Hawaii were amazing! The markets here are super out of the way, unfortunately
@iAmberJensen Regionally speaking, prices are better here than up there! We can't seem to find the FM equivalent for the area either.
Anyone else in the region find that Safeway is kind of a ripoff and Giant has better prices? We're amazed…!
ANOTHER Home Run by a Nats pitcher. LOVE IT.
RT @WestWingReport: It's hot today. How hot, you ask? WWR saw two fire hydrants fighting over a dog. Two shows nightly.
@dieri ha, more like bragger, I like the heat!
And for the record, I'm not complaining. :)
I like how the low is 72 degrees. Is it a rule, at least for DC, that summer really DOES start over Memorial Day Weekend?
@dieri Word. It's just how this town works, unfortunately. Ugh. It's so slimy.
I HATE networking!! Makes me feel like I'm using people! WHY does it have to work that way?
But they contacted me twice to apply, so that's a good sign, right? It's hard to job hunt in the meantime, what if something come up sooner?
Interview with a job I REALLY want is set for June 5 and might not know for 2+ weeks after that. Ugh.
And with that, I'm taking a 3-mile walk to get a much deserved cupcake.
I wish taking a drive was MUCH easier like it is in the West. It's better to walk anyway. Silly cities designed for horses....
@TWalk214 the Philly fans are AWFUL. By far the most vulgar. Love to see/hear them silenced.
@TWalk214 I love it!!!
@akswingley our "hometown" heroes! ;)
Ahhh I love the silence of the saddened Philly fans. My, how the mighty have fallen. (So far.)
@dieri woooo I was actually just putting on my shoes! Go team!
RT @MLB: Felix and Beltre started joking around, did ridiculous hand gestures and then Felix started taking off his jersey: http://t.co/ ...
RT @IWPResearch: Women continue to earn less both across and within the most common occupations. #equalpay http://t.co/faMPlaIa
Debating running... It's not hot, but it's muggy and buggy and lots of construction around. I think I just talked myself out of it.
@dieri Haha yes, they do have local sales taxes there! Then she can complain.
I would just like to know if these "Alaskan taxpayers" in Fairbanks understand what happens when they file their taxes: NO STATE TAXES.
Someone just outright refused to pay taxes again because the Alaska state court system is screwing her over. Totally irrelevant.
What is with people these days. Everyone is forgetting: ALASKANS DO NOT PAY STATE SALES/INCOME TAXES.
@redrummy I REALLY want to "educate" this person, but I don't want to come off as condescending… hence the twitter rant…
@redrummy Hahaha thanks, I just was so flabbergasted. Taxing car registration makes perfect sense: it goes directly to transportation!
FINALLY: I'm pretty sure anyone who complains about car registration fee/tax is likely to complain about state INCOME taxes. Be grateful.
4) if you can afford a beastly huge truck, you can afford to pay the registration every few years 5) It's patriotic 6) this is a DIRECT tax
1) YOU DON'T PAY STATE TAXES 2) you register your car every several YEARS. 3) oil $ can only go so far in paying for roads/infrastructure
I'm sorry, but I do not sympathize with people who complain about a $110 tax on a $100 car registration for a giant truck in Alaska….
Then again, the competitive pool here is like 2309489348x bigger.
I feel like job-hunting with a BA in Alaska in 2008 was easier than with an MPP in DC in 2012. I think that's backwards.
@iAmberJensen and a Master's is theoretically "easier" than a BA -- just two years of specialized studies. Go for it!!
@iAmberJensen that's exactly what it's like, actually. Makes me sad though, they get paid so little. And thank you!
Front Royal, VA, reminds me of a slightly cleaner/greener Wasilla. Interpret that as you may.
@washingnats sadistic much? When are they going to learn that Rodriguez can't pitch under high pressure situations at away games?!
I am officially a Master of Public Policy. All this family time and whirlwind travel is exhausting! Still more to come! But I'm grateful. :)
@dieri AGH forgot I tweeted this. Went to the same restaurant again and he teased me. NO WINE.
Tofay I had a first : smacked info a glass door. In public. The waiter assured me he did jt sober, but he lies.
On bright side of all the madness, can check one thing off the list: scored a highly sought-after apartment in an awesome building/location
@TWalk214 thanks :) i appreciate it
Thanks all for the kind wishes. No idea how much time he has, but I can't go back to AK earlier than July. He's ok for now....
Pretty sure I'm losing Dad this year. Stupid cancer.
@wendipqa it just baffles my mind. I'm talking about full-fledged adults, not "kids" (though I've known some who bought whiskey weekly)
@wendipqa ha we buy liquor too (though boy buys beer on his own), but some folks say they're pinching pennies yet buy $50 of booze in 4 days
@IamSauerkraut i hear it's different in this town. I was interviewed &amp; hired within 3 days of submitting an app, but they were sketchy.
@IamSauerkraut Yes, they said I was the first and said I stood out both at the beginning and end of the interview - 130 applicants
Had a GREAT interview May 1 - said I stood out among 130 applicants, had more interviews through this week. When should I start to worry?
But this whole OMG-we're-actually-good thing is a whole new experience for me, soooo….
Really getting tired of the "It's only May" argument. When Sept/Oct come around, those one or two games could make or break you. Just sayin.
@TWalk214 hHa no, but he has a good game today. Gio is my favorite. Rough game to attend, but we're still 1st!!
Show those obnoxious Phillies fans in OUR park who's on TOP!! Most vulgar fans I've ever witnessed! Who has a losing record?? YOU DO. Jerks.
Attended hell of a game at Nats Park. Favorite part = Phillies fans in our section chanting "Jayson Werthless" seconds before 3R homer. BOOM
@DCyetti did I show you that we got our mini-panda mascot a Nats hat? :) http://t.co/KR15ZMx
@Hokuboku haha! I love giant (and small!) stuffed animals, they're fun to personify in a not-crazy way :)
@Hokuboku he's gonna be hilarious to move next month: strap him in a seatbelt. We found mini baseball hats for our small pandas too...#nerds
@Hokuboku this one is King Panda. Long story behind his outfit... I want to get him a "beast mode" tee. http://t.co/lPeEPTo
@Hokuboku hahaha that's like everything Panda does: strange panda pics with no real context. I'll send you a crazy pic of our giant panda...
RT @SenatorReid: Excited to meet Bryce Harper, fellow Nevadan &amp; great baseball talent. Hope to see him hit one out tonight #national ...
@Hokuboku :) where did you find the picture?
I love all the Nats fans in my feed :) meanwhile, Os are in the 11th in Boston!
@NotRizzo yeeeeaaah
RT @Hokuboku: I'm not quite sure what is happening in this picture but I approve: http://t.co/stnZRrwS
@Hokuboku hahahaha omg, my travel mascot, a small panda, has a Facebook page. I'm posting this on there.
RT @Nationals: That's the #Nats 5th walk-off of the year, their 4th in extra innings. #Nats are now 17-9, overall 11-3 at #OurPark
14 hits, 4 runs and 3 errors? If it ends in a win, I'm ok... just learn your lessons! Too many LOBs and Es!! Sweep em up, Nats!
Sitting in left field at tomorrow's game! I'll tweet some pictures of the rookie (Harper) for you ;)
Getting kind of annoyed at the weather NOT being as gross as they forecasted.
@TWalk214 PHI was ahead 6-0 through 5th, then ATL got 6 runs off Halladay. They tied back and forth 4 times, now 13-13 in the 10th.
@TWalk214 speaking of noise in the East, the Atlanta/Philly game tonight is ridiculous
@TWalk214 remember kidding me about "having" multiple teams? I may prefer some to the others, but I'm 100% devoted to our Nats! BOOM!
RT @Nationals: HOW DESI DO IT? Ian Desmond parks a walk-off 2-run shot with 2-out in the 9th and the #Nats win 5-4! #NATITUDE
@Alex_Keck CLUTCH!!!
That was one hell of a ball game. Did I mention how much I love the Nats?! Wooooo
I'm so sleep-deprived and blown away that I tweeted a double negative. You know what I meant. :P
Um. If nobody was convinced that Bryce Harper wasn't a phenom, I think that whole inning just proved it. Hits, throws, runs like a beast.
@PROTIPZ aaahh somehow I knew that would be construed sexually… ;)
I'm like 2 inches from being done with my Master's coursework. It seriously doesn't feel like it.
@IamSauerkraut ah totally understandable - I probably wouldn't spend my first undergrad summer in DC either!
@IamSauerkraut (finals week = I'm still awake) Is your son interested in Hill internships? We both interned &amp; can offer advice if he'd like
@dieri and I'm pretty sure you have a juicy story to tell me about sometime... Maybe via email? ;)
@dieri and you're not on that list!! ;) it's only about baseball though, haha. I figured I'd spare you.
@IamSauerkraut In DC (long story about why). We're planning on staying in the area at least another 3 years while Boy gets his PhD.
In other news, I'm SUPER close to finishing my MPP, I rejected a job offer, and I have an interview tomorrow and maybe one next week. Woot.
But it's not just baseball -- it's just what I love and understand the most, so I'm not afraid of embarrassing myself if I rant publicly. ;)
I've become such a sports nerd. And I have a special "list" of people who get my baseball rants on FB, meaning I can spare twitter from it.
Sexy play by DeRosa, Espinosa and Flores last night. Our #5 starter did a damn decent job against LA's #1. http://t.co/YxJPvLQ
I just don't understand why an Alaskan is better at parking than a bloody East Coaster. That's totally the opposite.
AGH. Sorry, Twitter. I needed an outlet. I hardly talk on here anymore and this is what I give you. :D
And her car was TINY. She moved it 1 foot and another car could definitely park there, but she's too dumb to see where a parking sign is.
Just lectured a woman about double-parking on a high-demand street, and she doubted 2 cars could fit there. I'VE LIVED HERE FOR 2 YEARS.
AWESOME day in Beltway sports -- even the Wizards won.
@wendipqa @ckinneen pretty sure Sticky Fingers is the famous gluten-free bakery in town
@wendipqa @ckinneen seriously just read about one. I just read there's an expo coming up: http://t.co/44vVVFj
Did that Bruin try to rough someone up and ended up giving himself a bloody nose? Ha...
@kpow17 woo! It was so distracting today, haha. We had a lot of work to do at home I could've done in 3 hours and did in 9. :P
@kpow17 oh yes, saw the last inning. Amazing stuff -- only 96 pitches in 9 innings, least since '99. This whole day has been crazy in MLB!
I am SUCH a baseball nerd. It's almost embarrassing.
RT @MLB: This is the fewest pitches (96) in a perfect game since David Cone threw just 88 and dropped to his knees on 7/18/1999.
It's an especially exciting day in baseball today…!
First Lidge almost screws over Nats (luckily Desmond delivered again), then CWS perfect game v. SEA, now BoSox gave up 9-0 lead in 1 inning.
I accepted a job offer last week,but I'm not sure about it...still applying to see if something better comes up (wouldn't start until May 7)
I'm proud of my parents who have both been self-employed for over 40 years, but they have NO clue what one does to apply to jobs today. :P
30+ degree swing in high temperatures within 48 hours makes for a diverse wardrobe. It was 88 on Monday, high of 55 today. And wet.
@dieri aaaand I got the job ):)
Got a call back after my interview.... Keep your fingers crossed!!
Haha, I like how this is on the MLB home page http://t.co/IOxVDyl
@hh_alaska ooh! What is it? I am gathering a collection of quick, healthy dinners!
@NotRizzo @TheMrinella I didn't like that inning either, it was just too scary.
RT @Nationals: Your #Nats have won 7 of 8 and are now 9-3, atop the NL East #NATITUDE
@DCyetti Wheeeeeew that hit was scary
@DCyetti Does Lidge scare you? He scares me.
I LOVE Gio. I want to bake him a cake when he hits a HR. Lidge - he makes me entirely too nervous. He has yet to impress me this year.
Dry, breezy air and CRAZY A/C make 88 degrees feel perfectly bearable. But I'm acclimated, so yeah. :)
It's always a good sign when you walk into an interview and people are talking about the Heritage Foundation. #runwhileyoustillcan
It's deceptively cool in the stations, and stagnant air on the cars. Aaahhh whyyyy. I switched cars 3 times.
Of all days not to have AC on the metro. Seriously, did you even read the forecast?!
FINALLY. I'm just SO excited about it, I'll RT stuff for days. RT @Alaska: House passes autism insurance bill. http://t.co/uTpxc3V
Yes, IT does, but… ;) RT @SeanParnellNews: Alaska House adjourns legislative session  http://t.co/4EID8CA
In other news, first big interview today. Not sure if I really want to work there, but here it goes.
I have a giant fear right now that whatever job I get won't cover my fabulously new student loans. Makes me miss only having a BA. :P
Good golly, 68* before 9am - it'll be HOT today. Luckily it's just 1 day, then back to 70s and 60s. I like the 80s, but it's too early.
@dieri double USA!
@dieri what! I only looked it up because you said it would make me jealous, so I was curious
@dieri ah your weather does look awesome. Tomorrow it's supposed to be 88 and then cool down to 70s, then 60s again. Crazy swings.
@dieri hahaha
The people in my family who think I'd be good at hosting political talk shows obviously don't know me very well. :P
PASSED THE HOUSE with a vote of 34-3 (although I *know* one Nay vote was by accident…). Exciting day. :D
AWKWARD that was the wrong link. HAHA! Here's the correct link: http://t.co/P9TC25u
Watch the AK House Floor live - after this bill comes the autism bill: http://t.co/x2ietBK
When the AK House gavels back in, they'll take up the calendar - the autism bill is the 3rd one on the list. EXCITING times.
@mdbarber Haha,i love the headline.My folks just got back from a month-long trip, Mom says the snow is dirty - she said it with such disdain
@mdbarber we had that ALL throughout march until 3 days ago, so i'm good :D if was freezing most mornings
It's pushing 80 and it feels AWESOME!!!!!! Sooooo happy!
@leslieridle Jackson pitched a complete game, retired 22 out of the last 23 batters, ended 4-1. Yay!! And no, we have too much schoolwork :(
@leslieridle 4-1 in the 8th! Nats retired at least 15 batters in a row, they're kicking major butt.
@leslieridle Flores just got a single. If you're going through the Midwest, they've got wicked weather right now - tornado madness.
@leslieridle ha! It's 3-1 Nats, bottom 4th, 1 out. Is the flight bumpy?
@chillygal haha those things are never right, even in the sun, I've noticed, but I'm overly sensitive :)
:) My not-so-sentimental dad said he misses me. That makes me happy.
@chillygal was just talking to my folks in Fairbanks, they said it was around 60 recently!
In other news, it's 75 degrees today. Just wanted to throw that out there. :D
AK Autism bill on its way to House Labor and Commerce, where it WILL have a hearing instead of a waiver, but chances are GREAT for passage.
I'm SO tired, have been for 3 days,& we have a big, fancy, late night out tomorrow: need SLEEP. But it's the 13th inning on Friday the 13th!
@dieri I got it 1 second later
@dieri dope! You're lame :P
@dieri ?? What?
DAMMIT Jordan and Ryan Zimmerman(n) look exactly the same - their names are only different by 1 N. I thought the PITCHER just hit that. :P
Great story in the Post on April 2 about the Nationals' bullpen. Exciting stuff.  http://t.co/HLzfufi
It's just interesting stuff. It's good to pause and think about the struggles people endured to make love and freedom possible.
I wonder if they met young, maybe 40-50 yrs ago, were ostracized, shunned, scorned just for who they loved :( but happy, old & together now!
There's an adorable, elderly interracial couple in our neighborhood - I wonder what they had to go through to be together. They're SO sweet.
As soon as I put my hair up, I felt more awake. Funny how that always happens. Glad I ran on this perfect day!
It's still early and it could still change, but I REALLY hope it's not 87 on Tuesday when I have an interview in Arlington....
Been whining about 30s/low-40s in mornings lately, and how highs are not warm enough. Looks like I get my wish soon :P http://t.co/6MjAvqk
@wendipqa haha I will! On FB though :)
@IamSauerkraut haha sometimes the ones with kids are awake at 4 when I'm tweeting at 8. Usually they're active when I'm already in bed.
@IamSauerkraut so when I'm tweeting, they're still asleep, at work, or having dinner (like now), so I guess it makes sense
@IamSauerkraut haha no!! main thing is most people I interact with - nearly everyone - are in the west or in AK: 3-4 hour time difference.
@IamSauerkraut I don't tweet as much as I used to! I RT more than I tweet these days. You seem to be the only one that notices anymore, haha
And I had my 19,000th tweet today (which includes RTs), evidently. I opened my Twitter account in March 2009.
I LOVE BASEBALL SOOOO MUCH. And Gio was a BEAST today. You gotta watch this clip of his first MLB hit. http://t.co/d43vmY5
Let me just say, expect saucy pictures, FB friends. I'm excited for my handsome man to get into a suit again too. :D
I'm so freaking excited about my new dress for a formal event on Saturday I want to tell EVERYONE about it, but it's so insanely vain.
@IamSauerkraut haha yeah, the Kennedy Political Union tries to get the "best" of both sides. (I saw Obama at a non-AU thing though)
I've also seen Obama speak and it still feels like a dream, 2.5 years later. Just so nobody doubts my loyalty. ;)
Huntsman is speaking on campus next Wednesday night! I mean, I saw Bill Clinton, which is infinitely cooler, but still.
Fascinating to hear Ellen Malcolm in the next room - just chatting with supporters like any regular person. Such a pioneer!
I'm gonna say it: Keller has a heart of stone. This is pro-family, pro-Alaska, with bipartisan support. JUST DO IT. INVALID_APIKEY
I have 4 dresses that are a step below "formal," but I *do* have long black gloves… wondering if I could get away with that. Ha. :P #vanity
Having a wardrobe dilemma & I REALLY don't want to buy a new dress for this Sat's "formal" event.I have a ballgown, but it may be too formal
RIP Rep. Carl Gatto of Palmer. He was such a fighter.
I know I'm stressed, but ugh! These dreams are ridiculous.
I've been having crazy, sometimes awful dreams lately, and I'm really getting tired of it. Like four nights in a row. Awful stuff.
@IamSauerkraut that's what I say - go Werthless and maybe it'll be better. :P I think his beard is bad luck.
@Nationals PLEASE defeat the Mets. Thanks!!! :)
FRUSTRATED Nats fan right now. But I'm excited LaRoche is doing better than he was getting credit for. And Werth needs to go away. Useless.
@IamSauerkraut stupid Werth. So pissed at him. And LaROCHE is much better than he was getting credit for. Aaaaaaagh stupid inning!!!
@IamSauerkraut yes Sir, it does!
Man, this inning is kind of insane.
Pissed at the salary/rent discrepancies in this town (if that makes sense). TOTAL opposite in the same industry in AK - and preferred.
@dieri haha well there was commentary about how the overall story (French children's books written in 1930s) was nostalgia for colonialism
@IamSauerkraut baaaah as long as you know Barney and Babar are not remotely the same thing, it's ok :P
@IamSauerkraut nooo that's Barney the Dinosaur! Babar is a cartoon, and older. It's based on '30s French children's books. No singing!
@IamSauerkraut nooooo what?? :P
@IamSauerkraut ...like the colonialism and acculturation stuff. And why "Madame" is like 30 feet tall.
@IamSauerkraut yeah! We didn't watch it much when it was on TV as kids, but it's on Netflix & we got sucked in -- it's fun picking it apart.
Most epically silly date ever? Curling up with an iPad to watch... Babar. I'm telling you, it's sociologically fascinating. And silly.
@NHinAK yeah, stupid airfare. I feel terrible about everyone back home, it must be much worse -- and everyone HAS to drive.
I haven't purchased gas since mid-late January (hurrah!) -- price has increased about 60 cents. I drive about 10 miles a week.
Pretty sure I live in one of the most beautiful neighborhoods anyone can possibly imagine.
So excited: a bill I worked on in AK Legis will likely MAKE it, finally, after 4 whole sessions and 2 different offices working on it.
?? What did Werth do to the Cubs? Some Cubs fan was mean in his face from the stands. Bah.
YES. I have no idea who Chad Tracy is, but I like him. I also love that big Nats kid they keep showing in the stands.
Gotta admit, didn't expect that from LaRoche… NOT complaining!
I LOVED the look on Gio's face when he actually hit the ball super far (granted, it's windy). Too bad it was caught. I love pitchers at bat.
Woooo red flag warning! For probably about a week straight! Reminds me of home, except 20 degrees *cooler* and 3 months early. ;)
@wendipqa hehe, I'm mean :D same to you and yours! Be safe up there!
I'm really OK with running at 60 degrees and admiring tulips and cherry blossoms instead of dealing with snow in April. Not gonna lie.
@dieri woooooooo
@dieri hockey is more fun in person - but BOY, NHL is expensive!! College games are fun though.
@dieri we watch "Looney Tunes" (silly spelling" almost everyday at lunch! And we have some downloaded. Hehe.
@dieri it's not joining a bandwagon if you've never lived in or near an NHL city before! They're working on one in Seattle, I hear
@dieri the DC NHL team who has dominated their division for several years now, I guess -- it's just cool there's a playoff team here! ;)
@cnichols14 raaaaa knock on wood!!!! I'm terribly superstitious when it comes to sports :D
@cnichols14 yay for Caps!! But knock on wood for Nats -- remember the Os were on top for first few weeks last year, then went back down
Dammit, the downside about flipping through Netflix cartoons with your 28YO boyfriend is being subjected to He-Man and Bravestar. Oh my.
RT @cnichols14: #CAPS CLINCH A FREAKING PLAYOFF SPOT!!!! Incredible. Thanks #Flyers!
Not only are MLB, NHL, and NBA in season, but it's also the Masters. No more NCAA. I just care about everything MLB and the Caps. :)
Pretty sure I had the best run I've ever had, even when I was doing it more regularly. Perfect weather, perfect neighborhood.
@DCyetti hehehe yay!!
Who would've thought that 74 yesterday meant 57 + breeze = COLD to me. Wimp.
@dieri haha! I've ever done that at all, actually
Just sittin in the dressing room pretending to try on stuff. Said I couldn't buy anything on today. :P teehee.
That awkward moment when you walk into a dress shop and NOTHING is under $400. Let alone $200. Ugh I feel poor. Stupid formal....
@dieri yay! Sisters are special indeed. Glad you had fun.
@dieri what!! So did you visit family? Where did you go?
SO excited to see her next month - TWICE - haven't spent ample time with her since last March or seen her since August. Sisters are special.
My sister's ceremony will have Native American flavor - our great-great-great grandfather was a Cheyenne chief. Need to think of something!
This isn't even worth tweeting about, but I'll do it anyway. Sterilization is cool, kids. http://t.co/tsZ156U
@thc1972 hehe thank you!! That's funny, I imagine i annoy people with my baseball coverage ;)
I'm a job application MACHINE!!!
Ground lamb is amazing. Wish I could find it more often.  Yum!!
@mdbarber thank you! Happy Election Day tomorrow! ;)
My main concern is that I won't be available for a month and a half, so hopefully… yeah. We'll see.
Hoping for a response on an awesome job position. Not telling you what it is, but I feel great about it. Wish me luck!
@wendipqa haha! It's funny: the more people buy tickets, the lower the already low chances for each person, but more likely SOMEONE will win
@wendipqa haha, boy bought 4! He buys them fairly often, but no more than one at a time, usually. (They're $1 each, thank goodness!)
Seriously, that mega millions jackpot will be $1billion if nobody wins this time. Everyone and his dog is buying a ticket.
Pinot + Benny Goodman = dance off
Joy of eastern city living: haven't bought gas in over 2 months. Downside: finding a convenient, decent gas station is not easy.
The smell of Carmex makes me think of it being -50 outside when I was a kid. Dad would call it "bear grease."
@ajtxander it's exactly what it looks like...
Perhaps the most awkward exchange of pictures ever. http://t.co/bPZ5S1n
And there's no way we'd get a woman or minority Chief Justice for at least 20 years, unless something unforeseen happened. Ugh. :P
4 SCOTUS justices are in mid-late 70s. Ginsburg will be 80 next year - she has speculated retiring at 82. Another reason to GOTV this fall.
Of course, the week I pack up my winter coats, scarves and casual/dress boots, it's 35* and breezy in the morning. #yesimcold #notashamed
Oh good, spent time to curl my hair into awesomeness and the wind will most assuredly destroy the effort. At least it's not wet or humid.
Seriously, you think it would be clean??? Do you?! How silly. Definitely not letting it happen today.
Um, never give 2 grad students living in a studio 5 hours notice for viewing the place when we have 3 projects due + 2 meetings.
MUST read: Andrew Halcro's take on Sen. Begich's 2014 re-election chances. http://t.co/7BRXRsk
I vaguely remember it, but I was a big Nickelodeon kid. But this show has white people assimilating elephants to European style. Hmm...!
Last night we randomly looked through cartoons on Netflix,&amp; now we kinda want to watch more Babar, mostly for sociological analysis. #nerds
@wendipqa hehe yay! That's cute.
@wendipqa ha awesome! I've read studies about how that's "better" in terms of trying not to perpetuate boy/girl stereotypes
@TWalk214 bam!! And riots in the streets?? Sounds like awesome insanity. And you're a UK student, right? Best of luck!
RT @TWalk214: @AK2DC You always tweet me about natural disaster... FYI UK/UofL play in the Final Four. That might be worse.
@TWalk214 haha! Honestly, I was about to ask you about that! What do you think will happen?
Question to parents (which I am not): have you tried "gender neutralizing" your child's toys? Or getting them both "boy" and "girl" toys?
@VPOTUS_Russell I agree. I'm exhausted of reading such hateful rhetoric on both sides of the aisle about anyone in either party.
RT @newsminer: Supporters rally in Fairbanks against insurance-mandated birth control http://t.co/F7RG3PEI
I confuse myself. I HATE this uncertainty about what to do - feels scarier than when I was a college senior 4 years ago, with 4x the debt.
Nothing like brightening up a rainy Saturday with figuring out exactly how much student loan debt you have to repay.
@thc1972 (I guess I just don't notice the first name correlation, haha)
@thc1972 haha I was just about to tweet at you! I was gonna say it's funny how you discover names sometimes ;) no worries! Happy weekend!
@dieri I've got anonymity here - I'm as tongue-tied and anxious as they come when actually talking. Writing? No problem at all.
The other thing is nobody really knows that about me. I may say that, but I'm quiet once I'm in the arena.Women are often timid in politics.
I don't feel like I can be a political whiz anywhere else but AK. It's what I know, and it's unique. Less competition too. ;)
"Wouldn't it be crazy if Huntsman popped out of nowhere and was like, 'Here I am, stealing all your delegates, like a boss.'"
Insanely beautiful here today: 75, sunshine, perfect breeze, tons of blooming flowers.
Sooooo the Phillies lineup is dropping like flies... not that I wish anything bad upon anyone, but maybe it'll give the Nats a head start...
I feel so bad for the people who clean those places.
I really don't understand why people of "all" genders have to fail at urinating INSIDE a toilet, as opposed to the floor or the seat.
@TWalk214 …in which case it's forgivable, IMO. Until then, I like wearing real clothes in public. :P
@TWalk214 haha yeah. I never could get into the idea of wearing sweats, yoga pants, PJs, or otherwise lounge gear in public, unless pregnant
@TWalk214 hahaha my 74-year-old dad says the same thing too
@AKbirder whoops, actually rocks to build nests, not food - it's pretty silly though
@AKbirder oooooh this dastardly penguin is stealing another penguin's food! it's so silly
@AKbirder ha, I forget Alaska internet blows. Sorry :( But this is the first episode - just about the poles so far, lots of Antarctica
Whoever makes those Direct TV ads is brilliantly silly.
@AKbirder Aww - you might be able to catch it on their website sometime, probably on Netflix in the coming months or so
"Frozen Planet" premier on Discovery tonight is amazing - @AKbirder, you should try to catch it, amazing Grey Owl scene!
@NHinAK pretty sure I had a very minor benzo hangover today :P
Apparently Cleveland Park is the place to be. We'll hide out w/corned beef, cabbage, potatoes &amp; Smithwick's - everyone is already trashed.
Wow, DC loves St. Patrick's Day
I wish $1500-1800 for a studio or 1 BR wasn't normal here... ugh.
I love it when people new to DC scoff at high rent prices like they're not normal. They just make it obvious they don't know any better :P
I wonder if my meds last night had anything to do with it :p
A young Frank Sinatra visited me in my dreams. He serenaded me and we danced in the streets and grocery store.  I think boy is jealous.
@IamSauerkraut yeah! He sounded worried, but no risk of overdose for me. He's a good buddy. Why are you up so late?! ;)
@IamSauerkraut I'm in bed now. Had 2-hour delay coming back,couldn't have dinner at 10pm. Went to sleepy by 11every night in AZ, do confused
I can't speak any better than the typing. "I an glad I wasn't A loopy buddy before I drove the plane home"
I don't take this stuff regularly, but I'm a mess ok the plane, so it's kind of necessary. And I'm go sleep now time thanks for thefrisay
1 mg Klonopin + 0.5 mg Xanax = relaxing flight, but now I feel drink. So excited to sleep ok the ground. I don't like the air. it's high up.
@dieri thank you, I hope so. Colon cancer. They caught it at stage 4 this time in 2010, last radiation in December that same year.
@dieri it's either one operable tumor that might need a bit of chemo to give him a few more years to live, or that plus an inoperable tumor.
@dieri dad's cancer is back...
Cancer is dumb.
This Angels v. White Sox game is possibly the most exciting of the three we've attended this week. tied in the 8th. http://t.co/6zQcs7x
Alaskan Amber on tap at the Mariners' spring training field!!! YES!!!!
@AKbirder haven't been in a good place to see much of anything yet, just hungry pigeons at baseball fields. Going to Sedona tomorrow though.
@AKbirder just heard some crazy bird that sounded like a weird alarm going off...
@AKbirder Haven't seen any birds that looked particularly "different" to me yet - hearing some funky noises though
Totally rocking this get-up-early-to-do-schoolwork-before-fun-stuff-during-spring-break plan!
@dieri shameless!!! Expect awesome Panda pictures soon!
@dieri haha thanks. ;) I figured it out: for some reason my iPhone automatically set to Denver time and not Phoenix time, which my iPad did.
@dieri yeah, I just had to google what time it is
@dieri ha! Is it about 6 there? We should be in the same time zone now
And nobody is awake to laugh at me. Went to sleep so early last night that waking up at 7 is ok, but dammit, it's not even 6!!!!
Being in Arizona, my clocks do not need to change today. My iPad clock did not, but my iPhone clock did. So confused.
@AKbirder oh awesome, thank you! We're staying in Mesa, actually. if I see something interesting I'll tweet it!
@AKbirder what are the cool birds I should look out for while in the Phoenix area?
@goshrx yeah, we might, actually! We want to see the Saguaro Forest, sounds awesome.
@goshrx aww thanks - I'll try to send a pic for you! Haven't seen palm trees in nearly a decade, so excited. My first AZ  visit.
I like how this terminal is named after Goldwater ;)
@cnichols14 yay! Kind of wish the Florida teams are here too/instead - worth it for a free trip ;) but it'll be fun! You have fun too!
Surrounded by baseball fans!! I love it!
Just arrived in my 26th state: Arizona. Baseball!
Couldn't be more obvious she's chewing fat- and sodium-packed potato chips with her mouth gaping WIDE open. DAILY occurrence. I checked. :P
It's insanely disgusting when I can hear someone eating chips 3 cubicles over and 50 feet away. Yes, I judge people's food choices.
@IamSauerkraut ah that makes sense. Hey @AKbirder, how often have you noticed geese, et al, flying at night in rural areas v. cities?
@shalynharris and WHY can't the toilet-hoverers clean up after themselves?!
@IamSauerkraut ...but I recall them flying at night. Haven't seen them since I was home in Aug. But you're probably right about snow geese.
@IamSauerkraut TONS of Canada geese go to Alaska every year - I guess when they flew at 11:15pm (often), it looked more like 6pm ;) ...
@IamSauerkraut looks like snow geese are fairly rare here - haven't seen any either. Sounded like Canada geese. #nerd
@jmproffitt that's what she said... #couldntresist
@dieri haha, it's coming!! Next week!
Definitely just heard geese flying overhead. It's March and it's 11:15pm.
RT @postpolitics: RT @postpolls: Gender gap? What gender gap? #supertuesday http://t.co/eTImdhe1
@Lawrence but nobody will remember Romney was the conservative alternative to McCain in '08, & now Santorum is HIS conservative alternative
@Lawrence it would make infinite more sense for Alaska to go for Paul or Santorum - their views vastly reflect them FAR more than Romney.
Women are no more one-issue voters than man are - and that was noticed as SOON as women got the vote.
I also think people need to remember that women are NOT single-issue voters. Not all women are 100% contraception or 100% pro-choice.
I'm ALL about what @Lawrence is saying. This is why I want Santorum to win the nomination.
I just think most right-leaning Alaskans' views and policy preferences would more accurately reflect those of Santorum OR Ron Paul….
Does anyone really believe that most right-leaning Alaskans are pro-Romney? I mean, I know most of them don't even vote/caucus… but…??
…in an argument FOR the creation of Title X. I wonder what he (Bush Sr.) thinks about all this today?

I love watching Santorum's son, he's so funny - yawning, claps after everyone else is clapping. He's probably 10ish, very typical ;)
@mdbarber hmm… yeah i left the one, it's been 50 minutes now - I think it's reasonable to call again...
It's business related, so I'm sure they're busy… but ugh… me too. :P
If you make a flexible phone appointment, they tell you anytime between 2-5, you say 3, and then they don't pick up… when do you call back?
We'll be in Arizona next week primarily to see Spring Training games with my family - totally forgot about the Grand Canyon….
@IamSauerkraut ha! Grad students are much more disciplined... and older. But the part-time internship necessitates regular sleeping hours :)
@IamSauerkraut ahhh in bed and all cozy. I saw Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn a week or two ago w/the moon, I think Mercury was out too
Right now it's a crisp and clear 32 with a chill of 25. I want to bake in a dry 80 degrees wearing a linen skirt. Next week!!

@mdbarber haha yeah, it snowed very hard for about 5 minutes, but now it's sunny and it looks like it rained. It's not even 40 though! #weak
It's snowing CRAZY HARD in NW DC.
There are blooms on some trees and it's randomly snowing. Well, flurries. But it annoys me :P
@TWalk214 wow, that is crazy! I have a classmate from Louisville too - you're one of two people I "know" from Kentucky :) glad you're safe!

I love that my phone keeps wanting to correct "Santorum" to "sanatorium" - kind of awkward

@DCyetti haha he's speaking at the Westmark, I hear
Ron Paul is in my hometown of Fairbanks tomorrow, and a bunch of my otherwise politically apathetic friends are going. What does that mean??
@TWalk214 yikes, yeah - glad they're getting prepared though, sometimes I worry places are complacent.

@AKRyder @randomalaskan aaah I got the icons mixed up. I thought there was some finger-pointing to lesbian interests. Which is cool! Haha
Thank you twitter,for being my outlet again. I get fired up with nowhere to go sometimes :P
@RandomAlaskan @akryder what about Lisa?? I'm confused
@AKRyder I was talking about the Virginia law being debated right now about requiring vaginal ultrasounds before abortions
@dieri I have a whole conversation going now! Yay! Haha. And thanks. ;)
@AKRyder @randomalaskan haha, thanks, Ryder. I just need an outlet like anyone else, preferably relatively anonymous ;)
@NHinAK I 100% agree, which is why I don't understand why nobody is talking about ultrasounds as being routine for abortions ANYway
@907jw yes, exactly - why isn't the news talking about this on EITHER side? I think they will eventually
@AKbirder I've read in a newsmag long ago about a woman whose twin was aborted, but they missed her bc they didn't do an ultrasound
@AKbirder I think it's medically irresponsible if they don't have an ultrasound - it's about being thorough, not about refusing the abortion
@AKbirder they do it anyway - And they should. Docs need to see if there are multiple embryos. Patient shouldn't be forced to see it.
@AKRyder I know, right?! I'm probably sounding like a flaming conservative about it, but it IS routine and necessary!
@AKbirder @akryder I just needed an outlet. Nobody has been responding to my tweets for 5 days now, that never happens, haha :P
@AKRyder haha, I'm just fired up about both sides. Planned parenthood uses them all the time and people are NOW calling it "rape." it's not.
@AKbirder @akryder they ARE already doing ultrasounds. Docs need to see if there are twins/triplets, etc. It should be an option to SEE it.
@AKRyder pap is more painful. Ppl who have never & will never have one don't know this. They're routinely used before 8 wks bc for best pics
@AKRyder I'm talking about how vaginal ultrasounds are used ALL the time - they're routine & painless.Nobody is doing their research on this
@AKRyder just joining an overly covered debate with points NOBODY is making - facts are not being uncovered and it angers me
@AKRyder maybe I should tweet in all caps so people can see what I'm ranting about
AND NOBODY IS LISTENING TO ME
So my advice to BOTH sides: know what you're criticizing. Ask the knowledgable people and learn.
They use it, and it's what is used for most ultrasounds before 8 weeks bc it's the best picture. It's less painful than a pap smear.
This vaginal ultrasound law baffles me - for far more "conservative" reasons than you think. Planned parenthood uses it all the time.
But normally she's cool with  me, so I don't know. Kind of awkward. Seeing her in a couple of hours. Social media is lame sometimes.
So, I'm not sure if this one person deleted a couple of my comments because they were somehow "offensive," or if my app was not working.

@mdbarber being polite,I mean.I feel like westies aren't used to it being crowded,hence apology - not bc they're laid back (though they are)
@mdbarber I think it's primarily because it's a LOT more crowded in the east - you get used to it. That comes second, as I've noticed

DAMMIT Anchorage, your weather is almost the same right now, except it's windier here - ultimately we're the same windchill. lame sauce.
Actually, less than an hour ago it was 34 - the temperature dropped 8 degrees and the wind kicked up and made it "feel" 13 degrees colder
Less than an hour ago our windchill was at 30. Now it's 23. I know you Alaskans don't pity us, but I thought I'd share.

We have all sorts of weather advisories! How exciting! Nothing terribly insane or long-lasting though. http://t.co/tHiuVGG
@XSTROLOGY (not me, I'm a Scorpio...)
@XSTROLOGY hahahaha i can refute that x 3
I want a mocha but it won't be hot anymore by the time I bring it home :( I'm a HUGE brat today, by the way.
@NHinAK I don't "hate" people I don't agree with! I'm a hell of a lot more moderate than most people realize. I've voted for GOPs before.
@NHinAK haha I don't hate anyone, least of all someone so harmless. I don't want an argument. What she does is her own business, not mine.
@vickiorion Haha, well i figured, the hotel is just half a mile away, might as well take a stroll and people-watch ;)
@NHinAK @akryder it's just funny when someone goes on about "public service" the whole time. She's obviously smart when it comes to making $
@wendipqa see latest - not that exciting, but it's funny that they're so close. Wish I knew yesterday when the candidates were here!
Lots of cops, of course -  can't see them all. Lots of YOUNG people, mostly men. Scary. #CPAC http://t.co/y9Qxipw
They're all in there, plotting... #CPAC http://t.co/oZKXkdv
@AKbirder ha I'm more worried they'll take away my ovaries since I'm not really using them #birthcontrolFTW
I feel like I'm nearing a lion's den
Aaaaahhh spotted CPAC totes and folders
@AKRyder oh yes, I know all about that ;) we have giant hard-deadline project due tomorrow, so for now I'll go point and laugh at starbucks
@AKRyder haha it happens ;) more Alaskans seem to be bitter at them than any other "politicians"
@AKRyder hahaha. We have a poster board and Alaskan flag... Would be fun to go down there and be obnoxious around 4:00, but I won't ;)
@AKRyder not that exciting or extraordinary, but he was definitely taken aback by my random energy - I startled myself
@AKRyder sooooo tempted. If I saw Todd Palin I wouldn't hesitate: "Well hellooooo, Mr. Palin!" - did that in the AK Capitol once hehe
Omg so many CPAC tweets in the neighborhood, I feel like I HAVE to get out there just to people watch and tweet silly nonsense.
Thinking about working on my project in Starbucks... the one right next door to the CPAC madness. My imagination is ripe.
@dieri Aaaaahhhhh nooooooo
@dieri ...she got crap for"using"her husband's name.She was a political badass before she even knew him. Palin didn't get sexist stuff in AK
@dieri she got a LOT more about it than Palin did, as I recall. Remember when she teared up in NH? Media blitz for weeks. Plus...
@Dieri here's some comedy relief for you: RT @goshrx: http://t.co/HQcCy7U  nsfw, btw.  Crazy CPAC self haters.
@goshrx HOLY CRAP
@dieri stuff like that just perpetuates the fear women have against running for office. GOP or Dem, we need more women in office #17percent
@dieri It's never ok to make sexist or racist comments or insults. We have to move past that in this country - we're so backwards. :(
