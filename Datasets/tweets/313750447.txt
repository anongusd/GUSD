@LoriinUtah @thecloneclone @TwitterSupport @SonOfGodAndMan These idiots are not worth your time and effort. They have no sense of respect for anyone but themselves.  When they grow up, perhaps they might change.  If not, it was due to poor parenting.  If they give you more crap, just BLOCK them. You are worthy of God's praise for trying.
