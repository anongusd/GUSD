The Democratic Party has a split image in VA with about half each saying they have a favorable and an unfavorable view of it. The Republican Party's image is more negative, with just under 4 in 10 rating it favorably.
PRELIM VA EXIT POLL RESULTS		Gov. McAuliffe has a slight majority approval rating among voters, with just over 4 in 10 disapproving. That's roughly similar to pre-election polls and suggest he may provide a small boost for fellow Democrat Northam.
PRELIM VA EXIT POLL RESULTS		About 1 in 7 voters decided in the last week, similar to the 14% who decided in the final week of last year's presidential election and 19% who decided in the 2014 senate race.
PRELIM VA EXIT POLL RESULTS: liberal identification is on par with 2016 high, w/over a quarter identifying as liberal. (Was lower in gov elections in 2009 and 2013.) About a third of voters ID as conservative, on par with 2016, but down slightly from previous years
PRELIM VA exit poll data: The top issue to VA voters is healthcare, with just under 4 in 10 naming it as the most important issue in deciding their vote. About 1 in 7 apiece name gun policy, immigration and taxes as most important. About 1 in 10 say abortion.
PRELIMINARY VA EXIT POLLING: About 6 in 10 voters say monuments to Confederate leaders on gov't property should be "left in place" similar to what we found in a fall Post-@ScharSchool poll https://t.co/KerJJrohUA
In '16: Dems outnumbered Reps in VA by 7 pts	In '13 VA gov: Dems outpaced Reps by 5 	In '09 VA gov: Reps outpaced Dems by 4 points
Partisan composition of voters has ranged a bit in recent VA elecs, Reps have tended to come closer in non-pres elections like today's
PRELIM VA EXITS: Dems appear to have an edge over Reps in party ID among voters, just under 4 in 10 ID as Dems, just over 3 in 10 ID as Reps
@EmGusk That's a similar margin as we saw in a Post-@ScharSchool poll earlier this fall: https://t.co/KerJJrohUA
Roughly half of VA voters say Trump is not a factor in their vote; among the rest, abt 2x as many say vote is to oppose Trump as to support
PRELIM VA EXITS: Just over 4 in 10 approve of Trump, a majority disapprove.

@DanCassino A design effect isn't a subjective assumption, but a calc based on the variation of weights. Many public polls take it into account in MoEs
@thepackpoll @sfcpoll Our poll survey takes into account design effect for weighting, which increases the MoE.
@DanCassino @LangerResearch The design effect is a function of weighting; 1.4 is in line with deffs of many public polls available in @RoperCenter (often higher)
@DanCassino Accounting for design effect in MoE is SOP in our polls. MoE is 	 4, but does not directly apply to HR leads, which require separate test.
