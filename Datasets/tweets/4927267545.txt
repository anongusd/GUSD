I can not forget about man. He has allowed the spirit of unfaithfulness and jealousy to reign his life and that of others But Christ Spirit must lives him.
An unfaithful man is one who can  not keep to his word.	 Fear them.
God is faithful 	I would have loved to do more but whenever  God made the provision available I will do more by Grace.
God is faithful. 	It's a problem when you hear someone talk about God in letters only. What about the action of the  Spirit?
I will not like to worship a  God whose  only purpose is to stay in me without him  using me to help others who are in need. Faithful FATHER cares for His own.
God is faithful. 	Why many religion. Because people want to present God from their own understanding ( Human presentation of God.)
When you feel down look above God is faithful. 	Like and share if you believe.
When we read books we try to fine-tune  our life to be like them(author) while not allow God to have an enter with you? It's the best.
When you look  with the eyes of faith the manner at which your life had being unfolding you will see that There is the very presence of the Hand of  the mighty loving Faithful FATHER. 	You too must be faithful to Him in every domain.
Throughout my christ-like life  Whenever I'm down or up a Hand will appear before me  pointing at particular word to me from the scriptures that word is "God is faithful" upon seeing this I quickly get encouraged bouncing and over taken in every domain.
If you think your bad behavior, disobedience, persecuting people will have  something to do with the faithfulness of God forget it. He will always be God. And a faithful one to his Sons and daughters.
Look religion is a very bad thing.  I almost got distracted with religion  I had to retrace my steps . 	And started at fresh just the way God called me.

You have refused to study the Bible. 	Refused to meditate on the word of God. Refuse to practice the word. 	refused to attend service. 	Refused to even pray. Yet you want miracle? Miracle is as a result of practicing or having the word in you. What else can God do for you?
God is faithful. 	They may say no but God says yes. One thing is for sure there is a big Yes from God.
“Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you, casting all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you. Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devou
God is faithful 	If you are enduring a cold season, don't underestimate Christ can plant you right where you are at no matter how dirty, beat up, or worthless you may feel. Rest assured, He has strategically placed you in the precise place on earth for such a time as this.

Are you harboring an unforgiving spirit? What’s preventing you from letting it go? Remember, it is harming you far more than the person who has made you angry. Give it to God and ask Him to cleanse your heart and free you to experience His love and freedom.
Choosing not to forgive, is also a choice of your will. But the door of your heart is then shut and God will not do His cleansing work.
Choosing to forgive, is a choice of your will. When you make that choice your heart is then open and ready for the Lord’s cleansing.
why shouldn’t God expect you to forgive those who have offended you, when He has forgiven you of so much more?	Choosing to forgive, is a choice of your will.
If you forgive men their trespasses, your Heavenly Father will forgive you. If you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Heavenly Father forgive your trespasses” (Matthew 6:14,15, KJV).
Lord Jesus, forgive me for bearing a grudge toward the person who has wronged me. Come into my heart, take control of my life. Cleanse me of this unforgiving spirit, and fill me with a forgiving spirit.”
Let Him to take that unforgiving spirit out of your heart and give you a new heart with a forgiving spirit
According to 1 John 1:9, if we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to . forgive our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness (KJV). So why not dare to invite Christ into your heart?
God says “Come unto Me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” (Matthew 11:28, KJV) Isn’t rest what we long for when filled with the torture of an unforgiving spirit?
To forgive in your own power becomes futile, because your heart must first be cleansed of all that the things that unforgiveness creates. Only Jesus can make that happen.
Unforgiveness can be a hidden culprit. It can make you a prisoner within yourself.	When an unforgiving spirit LIVES inside you, it isn’t bothering those who have wronged you. They’ve gone on their way. But you are still holding onto something that has taken control
What is a“Quiet Time”?A “Quiet Time” is a daily personal appointment with God, during which we get away from distractions and meet with God through prayer and Bible study. Through these disciplines God talks to us and we talk to God.
When an angel of the Lord tells us to get up and get going, we are given the freedom to do it.  Peter’s experience in prison demonstrates that when we are held in bondage to anything. 	God can and will (if we believe) lift us up and set us free.
The ministry of holy angels wl nver contradict the Bible.	De actions of holy angels wl alwys b consistent with the character of Christ.	A genuine encounter wt a holy angel wl glorify God, 2de angel. Holy angels never draw attention 2 thmselves. Thy do their work $ disap
angels are a separate part of the creation. They were created before man as a different kind. They are not within us. do good people, especially children, become angels when they die. We remain human beings--not angels, and certainly not God.
God's angels are not teachers. God's word says thy are messengers that's what "angel" means and thy minister to us. God has revealed 2 us everything we need for life and godliness 2Peter 1:3 so any hidden knowledge that spirit beings try to impart is by nature evil and demonic.
Many have gone on to open churches – just look at the characteristics of their ‘so-called churches’ and see the traits of Jezebel. See what they teach; prosperity, fertility, sex, harvest; Baal worship
Baal was the god of prosperity, god of the harvests, god of fertility and sex	Baal is served today by many Jezebelic women and even men. The false gospel of prosperityand blessings is Baal worship.
To conquer manipulate, gain authority and control, Jezebel uses beauty and sex	These are women who use beauty, sex and seduction to get what they want from men and they teach other women how to use their beauty and sex to their advantage – they are Jezebels.
Even when Jezebel did evil, killed Naboth and God prophets, she never accepted guilt nor repented.	Women with Jezebel spirit, no matter how wrong they are, they never accept nor apologize nor repent they defend their evil actions. In the process they make you the guilty one.
Women with Jezebel spirit are manipulative and love to conquer. They manipulate situations to their advantage as Jezebel in the Bible did.
Jezebel loves authority and being in control	Jezebel loves being in authority and in control	When King Ahab could not get Naboth vineyard, Jezebel rose to authority and control.	Women who control or want to control men have Jezebel spirit.
Adam was created first then the woman. 	Because of love of authority and control, women with Jezebel spirit fight for equality; they want to be like men.these are the feminists	A woman cannot be equal to a man. Adam and Eve are different and they cannot be equal
God is faithful. 	Gives Diseases and sicknesses		Spiritual husband or wife comes with diseases and sicknesses, and may deform you – this is to chain you completely to themselves
God is faithful. 	Many men are suffering silently indoors. Pray for them brethren.
God is faithful 	Because you have another husband spiritually, you will disrespect the one you have. Spiritual husband makes a woman see her husband as useless, disrespect and not submit to him.
Spiritual husbands and wives hate the power of Jesus Christ power of the kingdom of God.	Every person with a spiritual husband or wife persecutes the power of Jesus Christ they persecute every Jesus Christ servants accompanied by miracles signs and wonders.
God is faithful 	Jesus cannot deliver you if you do not accept your situation. A doctor cannot treat you if you do not accept you are sick. Accept you have a spiritual husband or wife for Jesus Christ to deliver you.
Many people do not accept that they are in bondage. When you tell them they are in bondage they start narrating to you how Jesus died on the cross for them, how they are free, blah, blah, blah, but in reality they are still in Egypt bond.
God Is faithful. He speaks But who is Listening ? If We listen He is Faithful To Take Away Our Pain. https://t.co/6XBaihlITM

God is faithful to bring his perfect plans  into our  lives. Jer 29 v 11.
Lord I resist not your will because I know your  thoughts and  plans for me are not for evil. There are for good.
When we come to realised that We are  pencils in the hands of God. Only  then shall we say Lord use us to write your will here on Earth.
you are justify by the Blood of Jesus.
Let the word of God be your mirror
Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word. Which word.? Word of GOD.
Don’t allow your five senses to dominate your thinking. You must come to a place to where God’s Word is more real to you
The only sure way to overcome doubt is to place your faith in the Word of God and depend on that more sure word of prophecy.
A Humble Character should not be consider as a part of weakness. Rather it is a constiuent element of good leadership.
True humility is a realization and appreciation for the provision (healing, deliverance, financial blessing, etc.)
As a child of God you are entittle to recieve deliverance and healing by Jesus covenant. Have faith only beleive its yours. Be heal,
Your gates will always stand open, they will never be shut, day or night, so that people may bring you the wealth of the nations
God has open that hard gate for you. you will smile this week. Amen is all you need to say. Isaiah 60:11.
what is God is faithful?. it is not only a aword but a covenanted words you should hold in heart and confess when faced with any situation.
