You’ll be fine now. Wide fives all day long!! 🏁 https://t.co/Gffj34Zxos
What r u talking about? SMH. 	Derby results:	First race- I was 16. Crashed out. 🤦🏻‍♂️	Second- I won. 	Third-  I finished third. @erik_jones won(I hired him) @jeffchoquette was second	Fourth- I won. 		I’ve raced many other races in others equipment and won! https://t.co/oqE45Jug1A
Well all the promoters, track owners, series directors all seem to have a voice but u know what’s missing in that group? The drivers, owners, chassis builders, racers. Bubba and I talked. We r sickened that decisions keep getting made and yet our phones never ring. https://t.co/yrvjEynxvg

Dude. NASCAR owners r asking the same questions every week.  Guess what… racing is expensive. No one has the right answers. People needing to b down at the derby on Wednesday is one of the dumbest things I know. Cut a day out. https://t.co/rlWDBcjfvH
Yup. That makes sense. 🧐 https://t.co/JDtI4dm5Xv
Well Tires for the derby r in the $5000 range. Amongst other things that cost money, $3500 doesn’t look that far off. https://t.co/BwQQqg1ngM
Oh snap https://t.co/onHFmJU77E
RT @truckerjimbo: @KyleBusch I enjoyed watching pit stops, it matters man
Speedfest doesn’t need pit stops. The SNOWBALL DERBY needs pit stops. It was “one of” the last real races where all things mattered. Now I believe only Oxford250 is. https://t.co/4DpyC6OHOh
Is that the year u “won” but @erik_jones took home the trophy? Your right. U won on the track w wide fives. No one could touch u that day. U were GONE! https://t.co/NnknJZbYTT
Since when did you see the checking account? 		Here is a More realistic look… https://t.co/uQhTbmDkmS https://t.co/YgZjlzkXgv
I Don’t even know what those big words u used mean. Read before making wrong remarks. I don’t use cup crews for my SLM teams. https://t.co/aHfEwgkjkc

Get rid of wide 5’s and u might have a better day on pit road. 😡 https://t.co/wySqzH7u0C
I would best money that I (ME) could do a 17.50 pit stop for a SLM race. Anytime. If I can do it, there should certainly b people around a 50mile radius of any racers shop that can do it too. Practice a little bit and 💥 u have a pit crew. 🤦🏻‍♂️
The hired pit crew costs $3500 for derby weekend. We know this year after year and budget for it. Teams should know when u want to go race and win the SNOWBALL that there r added expenses. Always are! https://t.co/n6cmwPJPb8
Wrong. KBM brought truck only pit crew people. We practiced. @JHNemechek hired the 48 cup crew when he ran. Don’t hate on @KBMteam when u don’t know all the facts. https://t.co/qqA7qfQiHp

Very poor decision. It was the last race where we all knew what it took to win, the last true race where every variable mattered. It’s the freaking SNOWBALL man. It’s the Daytona500 of SLM racing. I’m disappointed to say the least. https://t.co/xs2jJ02xU1

He spun the tires first. If he had traction he wouldn’t have backed up into me. I then tired to help him get back going and he was too crooked and he almost wrecked. Did a great job to save it. We both made compounding mistakes. We’ll discuss and learn and move on. https://t.co/Qx5kiKKtTg

Yup. And on Monday we go to work to fix the issues and don’t just sit back to let the issues fix themselves. https://t.co/bPhRDmQHLr
I beg to differ. I believe it’s because of social media and bashers like u. Racing isn’t always about the show. It’s the experience w friends and family. Camping, parties, hanging out, building memories, etc. Try it some time. https://t.co/pYTCHOCPmN
So who’s fault was it we had repeat penalties on pit road then genius? https://t.co/oRITxv3Td6

There’s some really cool ones in there.  Some I remember collecting as a kid w my dad! Thanks for sharing. https://t.co/hJuBH60gAZ
No. He races really hard. Really well. He’s smart when it comes to the 2mile tracks and others too. He did his job. https://t.co/E2sgDoJh1H
Nice. Glad I could do my part. Good luck next week! https://t.co/HZzTjUT2JR
U have a problem sir? U don’t take issue w a person bringing a persons family, let alone 3 year old son into conversations on Twitter? Who can I report you to? Where do u work? https://t.co/SfJeFnUzbh
I would like to think I’m an old school driver who just missed his time to race in the olden days! I would have loved to have that shot! https://t.co/ApRmi5ILrt
Well ok. We’ll keep after it!! 🏆 is what it’s all about. https://t.co/vGpuxO17Zd
Damn. Sorry dude. 😔 https://t.co/BD408u62D0
Yup. I said this 👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻🤦🏻‍♂️ https://t.co/EfFz8CoXkV

“Why is the earth round?” Quoting the best @JimmieJohnson. We wish we knew but gonna work to find out. https://t.co/x7NogQmiIL
For what? It doesn’t matter how much or how little I do, it never going to make everyone happy. I’m going to make my family and I happy and time at home is best spent there. https://t.co/hY6DsWIDAm
So when r u gonna start? https://t.co/dABk9j5Rir
How do people press send? Team decision on pit crew. I walked right into the fight. I did drive a car 128 NOT on a residential road while in complete control. https://t.co/DdwD63d35w
That’s nice. Thanks. When u do get the whole story from my point of view, it might help make more sense sometimes. Wish more people tried this theory. https://t.co/ALiLwTvEXp
Damn. Now it’s just getting mean. https://t.co/7bczj16v0m
Yet you’re the one following me. 🤔 https://t.co/34HxqErVsS
Missed my point. Thanks for playing. https://t.co/hqw9hhMo9s
I know. This is so true. Makes me want to 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️ https://t.co/MaRhsPYHHD
We have some work to do. Some things to clean up but we will b here all year! https://t.co/E4JuaUGXiq
Looking really sporty there Lisa!! 🤘🏻 https://t.co/zxPqbwuVEu
My son will b just fine. Thanks for your concern but we don’t need or care for you. https://t.co/MCaMT3MJFj
If it’s cause the jack dropped am I supposed to take blame? Did I do it? If we went the wrong way w the wedge, am I supposed to take blame? Did I turn the wrench? Is it always my fault no matter the reason? Is it also my fault when I win? “Sorry, I was too good today.” 🤦🏻‍♂️ https://t.co/8FAt7fQuWZ
Your boy sucked more then me today. Eat that crow bro! https://t.co/g96SH2ZAcu
Keith wins tweet of the day. Just cause I said so. @KBwebteam will get a care pack to u this week! https://t.co/N2LMvP3DNv
So true. I could do one every week and say the exact same positive things and b too boring!! Everyone wants opposite. Brexton going thru this right now. Guess we all never grow up. https://t.co/TdlOpvb1bX
Then I’d never get to slap it back. Double edge sword I guess. https://t.co/qxW5yOnrld
And comments like yours make me wonder who raised you. Must come from experience. https://t.co/uc0aUzfMfd
Wrong. If tv didn’t want to interview me after I won a race I could care less. I did my job. They just happen to b there in our celebration. U can continue to b your douchey self tho. Your “entitled” too. https://t.co/u2OFvQh03n
I’m thinking it may b higher then 50% but I’m certainly not going to sit here and count. Still lots of #RowdyNation fans out there!! https://t.co/3VsF65OZyG
After a race or a game is over r u not supposed to walk off? Is your expectation for me to sit there and wait 365 days for the next event at that track? What about getting onto next week? https://t.co/0MjOmrxBjf
I guess it’s just more content for those “mean tweet” segments that shows do. https://t.co/vIVlRyJ8dj
Keyboard warrior would b an awesome emoji. I still can’t believe that there isn’t a troll emoji. How is that not in this world yet? https://t.co/ISucNZtS6J
Finally, Top 3 finishers to media center. Not sure why this one stopped and went to Top 2 but I guess maybe it’s because we don’t do a “podium” in NASCAR so we r different.
Also what r drivers supposed to do that get parked w loose lugs at the end of pit road? Stay by car and wait for tv? Walk to a bullpen area?
What seriously needs to b determined is what’s the requirement post race. My suggestion is Top 5 required for TV interviews on pit road (this goes for TV too). TV can’t just skip a guy cause he’s not “a story” or not air the interview bc there wasn’t time to air it.
Damn. Sorry I missed it. Maybe my mom recorded it for me and I can watch it when getting my bottle before bed tonight. https://t.co/jAy7Iqu4s8
Something to said here. I might just have to agree. 🤔 https://t.co/tP7sbo2EXv
U should see how fast I run. Jimmie has nothing for me when it comes to foot racing! That’s why they always catch him. https://t.co/8saMGnvYNW
Typical NASCAR “fan”. Points out kyle busch “blows off” media. Guess we r the same. https://t.co/4d55dPNghw
I’m almost 33 thanks! Be happy to talk. Whenever they want. https://t.co/sbhWujtM4T
Top 3 aren’t required anymore. Top 2 are. But guess what, I’ll go all by myself anytime I finish top 3 just cause it’s what I should do! How bout that?! https://t.co/j0FvJl9lcN
Damn right they “couldn’t catch up”. I walked right past them and they had 5min to prepare. 🤦🏻‍♂️ https://t.co/aIFgX3USuu
I’m 🤯 w this one https://t.co/Y7Joqm7wKs
Yup. That’s me. If it’s typical then why should it not just b the normal? Why change? https://t.co/U5C168WXa9
Not sure that’s a positive thing. 2nd is better then third however “if your not first, you’re last!” https://t.co/ONQfcR4QLl
What post race interview?! Apparently I declined in case u were late to the party. https://t.co/8yRDFeEkG9
Thanks!! I wish we were better. We were good early. Just never got back what we had the first run of the race. Such a bummer. https://t.co/WkxgVvkPAE
Maybe. Just maybe that could happen. Do think that would b cool? So then u and all your keyboard keys can tell me how bad I suck for running top 5 each week? ⌨️ https://t.co/lRSzq0FPuD
Yeah and how did u do today? Where were u out there? Oh, at home? I’ll ship u my 3rd place diaper. 💩 https://t.co/l8F3sHqs9B
There was even a NASCAR person who walked w my PR person and myself and we asked if we needed to go to media center and we were told “all clear”.
Another race-another moment in needing to defend non postrace interview. NASCAR parked me at the end of pit road for loose lugs. I then walked pit road the distance back to the turn into the garage and only MRN asked. TV was elsewhere. They had a shot, skipped it.
Pretty cool to have @icecube stop by this morning. #ItWasAGoodDay #NASCARGoesWest https://t.co/DpzjNbtHon

Now that would make things interesting!! 😳 https://t.co/HRtIPpF26y
So does that mean both sides r even? What should we do about the weights? https://t.co/gOYCSGai4a
Who ya got?  #MegaRace2
I was being patient to c if they would work it out how they wanted. Both sides gotta fight for what they want a little bit don’t u think? https://t.co/sa4C52JjSY
Weight in racing is always something to bicker over. I could understand both sides. Wait til u c what’s next!

Yes please. I hope it's to sweep the weekend and not the lug nuts out of my pits. https://t.co/fkFSGUo50e
Great ?. Long answer. My Dad was a car guy and raced, was really good, followed in his foot steps. Turns out it worked for me. https://t.co/V5v1ZwCJo3
Yes. I do. I think if we have 4 plate races, why not 4 RC races? https://t.co/BiceDOuc1p

He better!! I'm not writing him an invitation to victory lane! https://t.co/T5UQAWHSWy
I would b a great defender but past that, I don't need the ball. Plus, @Brextonbusch doesn't get to c me enough as it is. https://t.co/5m85zwHJu7
Dale Sr would b fun but there r a lot of greats that made this sport. Cale, Pearson, Petty, Richmond, Turner, Flock just to name a few. https://t.co/kgEFyxoLx9
Yes. @AntronBrown @thesargetf @johnforce_fc just to name a few. I'd for sure make a pass! https://t.co/f7P82l1DV5
👎🏻 Nope. Very unfortunate. https://t.co/ZMOdADUpcZ
Just a tad. I felt a little change but wasn't a big deal. Had a fast car thanks to my guys. https://t.co/xY2eWFFHv3
Less downforce in the cars then years past so that means we spin the tires and slide the tires thru the turns more trying to carry speed. https://t.co/oGmFHzaVii
Drop a resume by w Kelli at the front and we will check it out. Thanks https://t.co/MF9tEJxaKy
Have the Jr fans forgiven me yet is the question. Haha. Time has passed. Things change. People change. Right @DaleJr ? https://t.co/rCBmYOvUMV
I would love to and had it all sponsored and worked out for this year to do it but someone said no. https://t.co/3WRy53uyuf
I sure did. Hits the spot every time. Miss it out east but prolly a good thing we don't have it n NC. https://t.co/4PpeHAfGY9
That's pretty cool. My dad has some sheet metal in his garage. I collected when I was younger of my favorite local drivers n LV. https://t.co/otbHqlEYJl
Plenty of fans have been doing this over the years too. They r home made versions. Very creative people. https://t.co/tKAtqON9f2
The other 35 drivers that all want to win. Seriously tho. It's hard to pass sometimes when we r all packed up tight. Track position is big. https://t.co/vcpU07Ek4v

I will b running the triple @kyspeedway. Going to b a HOT weekend I'm sure! https://t.co/dEwj9Ny6U8
I've been really close there the last 3 years. I've given at least 1 of the 2 races away in those years. https://t.co/2QvyK4tYCG
U need the clutch to come to a stop and go again so we can't take it out of the cars. (Pit stops) We just don't need it to shift gears. https://t.co/njCmO2ci5J
@JoeGibbsRacing chose to give it to @Daniel_SuarezG over me. Not my decision. https://t.co/H4TsqoI7Nc
Well, last week I feel I was going to win that one. Then a caution. This week u pit and need the caution. If u do opposite 18, u will win! https://t.co/Wnigr5N69q
Yes. I think it's the perfect track for all 3 NASCAR series but especially the trucks and NXS and even the K&amp;N series. https://t.co/Vrcj36C5qv
Gonna miss him for sure! Was great battling him there at the end for 5th. He's sure gotten better at RC racing. https://t.co/JDcB5ahi3L
That's a great thought. Never crossed my mind. I always love winning but I like to c and collect the post win diecast too!! https://t.co/gGB7Pyh6xW
Thanks. And your not joking!! Been right there every time. Still find it really odd I have yet to get a NXS win there. https://t.co/fTRArDtsaC
I would bet that 95% of the drivers today were doing all their shifting w out the clutch. Don't need it. https://t.co/qxhcR4B2s9
That's the plan. I believe we can do it. Only 1 w the shot to make it happen so we might as well. 🏁 https://t.co/lnddqfRiGd
I hope not w the way things r currently going for the 18 team. Gonna need a opening for us being top point guy not in. https://t.co/TL9UGO1Hi2

Yes. Unfortunately we had a missing lug nut on the LR post race. If it was only 1 it should b a $10k fine and move on. https://t.co/b8qfe2kYoJ
