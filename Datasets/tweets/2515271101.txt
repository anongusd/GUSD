"The closest thing to a ‚ÄúRecon Ranger‚Äù is the 75th Ranger Regiment Reconnaissance Company. But even that unit did not exist until 1984, a whole decade after the Vietnam War. Even if it did exist at the time, the training length would be at least six months, if not more."
"Then you would have to take into account the time for his training and mobilizations. Phillips also claimed that he was a ‚ÄúRecon Ranger‚Äù during the war. There was no such thing as a Recon Ranger."
"Phillips claims that he did two tours in Vietnam. Tours can be anywhere from roughly 6 months to 2 years long. That means that Phillips would have had to have been, at the oldest, 16 when he started his 2 tours."

@RazorPack65 @Nick_Clamorgan @POTUS Checks points is where most of border patrol agents are stationed. So using stats of checks points is missing drugs being smuggled in by other means in areas not fully covered by border patrol.

@SenFeinstein Democrats funded FY2018 for the border wall, and a promise to increase funding FY2019. If the budget committee would get the budget done by deadline with Appropriations approved, shutdowns would not happen. It's Congress job to budget, not the President. This is Congress shutdown
@SenFeinstein That's a lie!

@realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi Why are those in Congressional leadership speaking as though Public Law No: 109-367 is a suggestion rather than a law binding Congress to fund and complete as directed?
@realDonaldTrump Sec. 3 is clear. It doesn't say Fencing and or Security improvements. It is written to include both and the entire Southern border to be fenced. If China can build a wall over Mountains starting in 7th century BC, there is no reason why we can't do the same today. @SpeakerPelosi.

Congress yearly. I would also like to know why DHS is always funded by  "Continuing Resolution" instead of being placed in the yearly budget as the other 11 Appropriations are accounted for?
Aliens are still crossing our border on foot, the drug traffic &amp; human trafficking has increased in the USA. Opioide overdose &amp; death continues to rise.  Due to the fencing not being completed as the law instructs in Sec. 3  &amp; has not been funded by
Congress to fund and complete as directed? It's almost 13 years since the law took effect &amp; the border is still not completed with fencing as required in Sec 3. Leaving US citizens vulnerable to security risk.
of fencing from the Pacific Ocean to Gulf of Mexico?  Sec 3.  states "FENCING AND SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS. It does not indicate one or the other. Why are those in Congressional leadership speaking as though Public Law No: 109-367 is a suggestion rather than a law binding

@realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi Congress is mandated by law to complete the Budget  by OCT 1st to fund government for 12 Appropriations - funded 5 by deadline earlier in the year. Congress failed to fund 7 Appropriations by deadline. The Budget for the remaining 7 includes 6 &amp; left out 1 Homeland Security.

when it comes the National security &amp; protection. Anyone with common sense would veto this budget. I urge all US citizens to read this budget  full of pork funding foreign countires aid/programs/security &amp; funds for international
the asylum applications of Central Americans in Mexico. Billions upon Billions of taxpayer funds spent on foreign aid for their defense, security, etc. Yet only $1,25,000,000 for border security funding for US citizens. No doubt US citizens who fund government take a backseat
non-profits who received Federal funding that promote &amp; encourage caravans, to break US immigration laws. Sneaky! Allocating $18,000,000 funding for ‚Äò‚ÄòMigration and Refugee Assistance‚Äô‚Äô  made available to process
Then an added whopper in Sec. 610 of the budget bill to prohibit funds &amp; prevent the Executive Branch from investigating the FBI, &amp; non-profit organizations. No doubt that Democrats are protecting Hillary Clinton &amp; the Clinton Foundation from further investigation. And those

@realDonaldTrump Hold your ground. Immigration reform &amp; border wall security! Democrats can't keep kicking the can down the road on these issues!! Stop giving benefits to asylum seekers/illegals coming into our country.
The SB1 gas tax was to go to repair infrastructure. Instead funds went to build the new SCAG offices skyscraper. Skid Row is not the only homeless area in L.A. or California. Tax payers are tired of this corruption in government.
That you &amp; main stream media fail to give him credit for.  If you continue to leave behind the average citizens, &amp; support asylum seekers &amp; illegal aliens, you &amp; others will see an uprising.  Progressive Policies do not work.
I've watched many of these videos about Skid Row in Los Angeles.  There is some mental illness, drug abuse. But I saw a lot more that were sane. You &amp; the Democrat party forgot the middle class citizens. @realDonaldTrump spoke to his base of the middle class &amp; kept his promises.
@SpeakerPelosi  You are willing to give asylum seekers leaving their country due to poverty; free housing, legal services, food, medical, job training, &amp; education for years. Yet US citizens are homeless living in the streets due to losing work, high taxes, high rent &amp; starving.

@realDonaldTrump EO to chomp away all those Congress perks! Staffing, travel allowance, pension 80%, 72% federal subsidy for private health insurace, death gratuity for families, reserved parking spots, gym &amp; dining membership for life, $174,000 salary for less than 6 months of actual work.
RT @winstonCovfefe: CNN reports the majority of Americans blame @realDonaldTrump 4 shutdown &amp; only 38% support #BorderWall. Unbelievableü§î!‚Ä¶
@RepMarkMeadows I'm okay with keeping the government shut down until they fund the border wall. As a matter of fact as a government worker, I want Trump to ask for more money for border wall &amp; security. Stop giving aid to our corrupt government Southern neighbors who pocket it for themselves.

@realDonaldTrump Nothing is 100%. But a wall certainly is a hindrance &amp; deterrent for the average illegal attempting to cross the border. It certainly would reduce the almost 4,000 deaths in the desert associated with illegal border crossings per year.  #SaveALife #BuildTheWall
@rebeccabardess @realDonaldTrump Your statement has run it's course. He wasn't the first person to use hyperbole during a campaign or Presidency, and won't be the last.  Obama's hyperbole was that we would be able to keep our doctors &amp; health insurance cost would be cheap via ACA. Neither were true. Give it up!

@SenSanders Seems @NancyPelosi &amp; @SenSchumer had no problem shutting down government back in January 2018 of non-citizens DACA! Until Democrats do what is right for citizens, I don't see much getting done for DACA ever! I didn't see you complaining then over Democrat shutdown or employee pay

@HarveyStaub1 I believe Congress has made exceptions in the past for the DOD. However, funds will need to be setup in a Trust for DOD with specific language instucting what specific project "Barrier Wall construction between US &amp; Mexico border". Congress must appropriate the funds.

@LepusPunk @SenatorLeahy @SenSchumer After reviewing your account &amp; seeing the number of your tweets 11.1K &amp; not one like, 24 followers since 2012. Seeing you frequently troll, abuse others, obsessive, demanding, mentally unstable, verbal threats, among numerous other red flags.
@LepusPunk @SenatorLeahy @SenSchumer Should you continue to make contact with me. You will leave me no choice but to report to Twitter your abuse/mental health status once they ping your location using you IP address &amp; send your local police to come have a talk with you. You truly are mentally unstable.
@LepusPunk @SenatorLeahy @SenSchumer Yes, Schumber is very much involved. Understand this, no one is here to keep you company or entertain you. Apparently you have some obsession with Schumber or a serious mental health issue to troll people, scream, attack, make demands of others.
@LepusPunk @SenatorLeahy @SenSchumer Well, aren't you a special troll who can't do his own research or knows how to google. Schumer is very much involved. Why should the Federal government use taxpayers funds to fund a tunnel owned by Amtrak? All you need to do troll is google Gateway Rail Project. Tons of info.

Mainstream media is reporting he backed down funding/building the wall. That is the second time he has backed down. His credibility just went down to almost zero and 2020 is not looking good.
@GOP I am beginning to think by not having a wall and border security, that the drug cartels are part of governments overall genocide plan.
@KamalaHarris Hmmmm lots of seniors paying for Medicare + supplemental that it doesn't cover. Just let the 30 milion have Medicaid and get out of my healthcare,
@realDonaldTrump I am not a criminal &amp; this only serves those who are. When is Congress going to start protecting all 325 million of us with border security e.g. wall? Throwing money at corrupt regimes has never worked. Stop giving our tax dollars away to other countries. https://t.co/GT3f8CGM6Z
@realDonaldTrump In this very moment mainstream media is reporting that you have backed down from the wall! What a disappointment! You are losing creditability and I hope you pull a rabbit out of your hat or 2020 is not looking good for you with those of us who have supported you. https://t.co/Qki6Fudxgg
@PaulieD55 @kaiaka It was bust. About 6 Congressmen/women a few witnesses that wouldn't share documents. DOJ would not let Special Counsel John Huber testify &amp; the IRS didn't show up due to a death for a one day event. Proves they protect her at all cost.
@realDonaldTrump I am sick of hearing the snowflakes say... "Trump said Mexico will pay for the wall." Hyperbole is wasted on them &amp; forgotten all the other promises you fulfilled. Obama promised affordable healthcare... the middle class is still waiting Democrats! https://t.co/bRhtZVbANb
@jacktomalis @AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense Pahaha... watching reruns? You do live a delusional boring life. If you have a wife, why are you spending all this time on Twitter? I am taking my friends suggestion to block you and fry cook to end this because you both can't stop making contact with me.
@jacktomalis @AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense Actually his father owns the place. And my friends began reading at my house while waiting on another friend and taxi. They participated in this conversation. Get back to fry cook and continue your relationship. I think she's a girl too!
@jacktomalis @AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense Sure... you and brainless have a nice night.
@AshGamesAcct @jacktomalis @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense Just the highlights. Your ass is showing BTW.
@jacktomalis @AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense Applebee's? Pahaha... aren't they closing down? I've never stepped inside of one. I guess I will need to block you. You seem to not get enough! You and Mr. Sensitive with a BA &amp; your almost BA can now follow each other. Pahaha
@AshGamesAcct @jacktomalis @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense I own my practice and work 3 days a week. Maybe one day, you might get promoted to Asst. Manager again. Bye Fry Cook! lol
@AshGamesAcct @jacktomalis @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense Ahh... you are butthurt fry cook for pointing out your trolling attempts. I am signing off. BTW the waiter says hey and enjoyed reading this thread along with my friends. He said, "You &amp; Mr. Sensitive would make a lovely couple. Make sure to use a condom." His words, not mine!
@jacktomalis @AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense Ahh... you still didn't read the 1st link I sent to the kid. Oh, you are so dislusional, boring and homophobic prick.
@AshGamesAcct @jacktomalis @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense That would be you fry cook with an almost BA from McDonalds.

@jacktomalis @AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense I thought he made a typo. But Hey Jack, go F*ck yourself.
@jacktomalis @AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense I assumed you made an error fry cook!
@jacktomalis @AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense I have no more time for your BS games. I am headed out with friends &amp; have no more time for a Grandiose, delusional, lying, homophobe gay basher, who thinks he's the big time! You've become boring &amp; a waste of time. It was fun proving you wrong Jack, thanks for passing the time!
@jacktomalis @AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense And oddly enough, Landmark Communications failed to show up on your resume.
@jacktomalis @AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense Yes, with a Masters. Tell me Mr. Sensitive BA, why did you bring up gay marriage? Are you a homophobe? That's not very nice when you slam someones sexuality. Frankly that is no one's business but their own! Never make assumptions that someone who is conservative is a gay basher.
@AshGamesAcct @jacktomalis @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense Yes there is kid. It refers to the page number and readership card numbers for ads on the page. The term is trade jargon. I didn't expect a brochure writer to know that. Mr. Sensitive said I didn't know about the publishing industry &amp; I'm very familiar.
@AshGamesAcct @jacktomalis @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense No one is engaging you fry cook. You've been out of the conversation for a while now. You are a waste of time.
@AshGamesAcct @jacktomalis @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense Go smoke some of that 420 shit and sit down fry cook.
@jacktomalis @AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense You crack me up with all your important connections. But you ended up writing tourism brochures. Seems your friends got it going but you don't.  Some friends you have not helping you out. Just stop embarrassing yourself. Again never said the publications are based in Chicago.
@jacktomalis @AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense It's a publishing term, every publisher should know. Here is another term... Readership card ring a bell for you Mr. Publisher? Seems I know more about publishing than you.
@jacktomalis @AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense It's a publishing term kid.
@jacktomalis @AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense We live well. Jealous much?
@jacktomalis @AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense Oh yes we have been publishing for almost 200 years in several trades. Did I say the where our family business was located? No I didn't. I told you my current location! Mr. Sensitive has failed once again comprehension.
@jacktomalis @AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense Tell me what the term Bingo is? You should know it.
@jacktomalis @AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense When I was a kid, I did layout and story boards. I also sold advertising. I was on the mastheads. My father semi-retired &amp; my brother runs the business now. I was interested in the medical profession. You brochure writing doesn't even compare to running actual magazines! lol
@jacktomalis @AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense Not on the resume Mr. Grandiose delusional syndrome. With all that experience, you ended up writing tourism brochures. What a waste.  My father employs a Pulitzer Prize cartoonist if you want to play the one up game. Which you are failing at.
@jacktomalis @AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense Our family business owns &amp; publishes 8 magazines. Almost 200 years now. Our publishers do some of the writing. I don't give a rats ass who you sleep with! WTH does that have to do with the topic? You live in Baltimore MD, doesn't compare to the  Windy City. lol Mr. Sensitive!
@jacktomalis @AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense You say you were a communications intern for Hubble. College years 84-88.  Maybe a semester? Hubble was scheduled to launch in 1986. Yes, it was delayed for orbit for 2 years until shuttle flights resumed. They still continued to work on Hubble solar panels &amp; launched 1990.
@jacktomalis @AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense Nah I'm a Trumpster! Seems you are having a melt down! Let's see I have a Masters 30 years in my field. You a BA 4 years in the insurance business makes you no expert in the medical profession.
@jacktomalis @AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense You know working on the Hubble project would had been a nice touch on your resume as a brochure writer. PPO/HMO same crap. You sold &amp; marketed healthcare plans for 4 years. You win a prize!
@jacktomalis @AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense I'm a proud nurse too with a Masters... Mr. BA, Who had dreams of working on Hubble and ended up writing tourism brochures.  Check!
@jacktomalis @AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense Comparing your education, your resume, worked on Hubble.... pretending to be in charge of healthcare professionals such as nurses and doctors being a VP of a PPO insurance company. It's okay. Stop being butthurt.
@AshGamesAcct @jacktomalis @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense You would be wrong. Uncle's husband? lol I actually administer the anesthesia and I do monitor the patient and many other things. I own my practice too. Bye kid!
@AshGamesAcct @jacktomalis @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense Because I am no longer amused by the fry cook at McDonalds.
@jacktomalis @AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense I really think it would be you needing a psych evaluation... You fib alot and grandiose.
@jacktomalis @AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense You managed a PPO in the insurance industry. Your keep stretching the truth of how important you are. Far from being in charge of a hospital or in a private practice that I run. Bye dude.
@SenFeinstein You have a law enforcement problem not a gun problem. Law enforcement/states are failing to report to the background system. FBI dropped the ball 8 times that resulted in tragedy after people reported the perpetrators. We can't depend on gov. to secure our border or our kids.
@SenFeinstein Nope!

@AshGamesAcct @jacktomalis @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense Absolutely correct. I'm ignoring you at this point.
@jacktomalis @AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense I couldn't work for you. I am not in the field of tourism. I saves lives.
@jacktomalis @AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense Update your resume Jack.  https://t.co/ttOTAvQLYu 4 times failed business doesn't sound like a success. Masters degree Nurse Anesthetist (real science degree).
@AshGamesAcct @jacktomalis @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense Aren't you late for your job at McDonalds?
@jacktomalis @AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense Sure...
@AshGamesAcct @jacktomalis @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense I didn't never said JHU didn't offer BA course degrees. BS is required for the science programs offered. Which the degree "Materials Science and Engineering" Hint the name "science" in the field of study.
@jacktomalis @AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense I think we've past who is superior here. Master verses BA? I win. Now we are done. You have bored me.
@jacktomalis @AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense Hmmm... I think you all started with the insults when you began to fail to read my original comment. It was you that said I couldn't do research. Had all your information in 5 minutes.  Just proved you wrong is all. Don't be so butthurt.
@jacktomalis @AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense You continue to tweet me.  Only polite to answer. Never in my life have I ever heard of anyone obtaining a BA in the field of science. Especially form high profile Unversity as JHU. But you can continue with your fibs. Only you care.
@jacktomalis @AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense Dude I have your home address and your voter record. But I'd be breaking tweeter rules to provide it.
@jacktomalis @AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense With a BA? Hummm. According JHU only offers a Masters Program Materials Science &amp; Engineering &amp; you need a BS undergraduate degrees in engineering or science. Nice try. I have a Masters as Nurse Anesthetist, we tend to stick working in our field of study.
@jacktomalis @AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense Did you read the entire link? Look under History section. I just gave you the background on Rumsfeld. No need to correct your punctution. Unless your BA in writing seminars from Johns Hopkins University behooves you to. How's that for research &amp; you thought you had anonymity.
@pabstimus I was never trolling kid. You started with the insults from the get go. Treat others how you want to be treated. If you can't take an insult back, then don't start. The Space Force is a done deal. Get over it.
@jacktomalis @AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense So insult a highly respected profession? Oh please. Some nurses may read this and whoa be onto you if you need our services. BTW Donald Rumsfeld was Secretary of Defense for President Ford. Like I said, if you had read my 1st response. Stop being butthurt.
@Jim_Jordan @POTUS In July of 2016, the FBI launched a counterintelligence investigation into possible links between the Russian government and Trump campaign officials. If Hillary had won, would the investigation continued? I doubt it! Hopefully, the Clinton Foundation donations prove her guilt.
@AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @jacktomalis @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense You need to lay off the drugs!
@jacktomalis @AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense Maybe you need to lay off the drugs. We are done.
@AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @jacktomalis @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense You both failed to read the 1st reply, then you insult as children do, now who fault is that? My taxes pay for education and I see it is failing miserably. It has congressional bipartisan backing. We are done here.
@pabstimus There you go ahead... showing your age. Calling people stupid. Word of advice kid... don't believe everything main stream media leads you to believe. Trust history and do your own research.
@AshGamesAcct @pabstimus @jacktomalis @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense I provided the link in my first reply. He choose as you to read the 2nd reply. Some people can't read. It has never been a new idea. The idea of space defense has been around since JFK.

@pabstimus @jacktomalis @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense Hmmm... your profile states you were born in 2004. By calling people names, shows your age alone. I myself was alive when JFK was President. If you don't know who he is... google.

@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Pahaha... you've thrown your fair share of temper tantrums and said some pretty damning crap in your past. What's wrong @SenSchumer didn't get your 30 billion for the Gateway Rail project for your special interest buddies? The wall protects all citizens, not 98,000 rail travelers

It is important to note that this analysis does not address the costs associated with any incurred national security and law enforcement costs associated with some refugees who pose a threat.
$71 million will be spent to educate refugees and asylum-seekers, a majority of which will be paid by state and local governments.		Over five years, an estimated 15.7 percent of all refugees will need housing assistance, which is roughly $7,600 per household in 2014 dollars.
Of the $1.8 billion in resettlement costs, $867 billion was spent on welfare alone;		In their first five years, approximately 54 percent of all refugees will hold jobs that pay less than $11 an hour;
The cost per refugee to American taxpayers just under $79,600 in the first five years after a refugee is resettled in the U.S.;		In 2016, the State Department spent nearly $545 million to process and resettle refugees, including $140,389,177 on transportation costs;
Using the most recent admissions figures, data on federal and state public assistance programs, and information from the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), our analysis found:

@countrygal21 @Jim_Jordan @HuffPostPol God forbid if they are a diabetic, the lancets &amp; needles are not covered. Senior citizens worked their entire lives to pay into Social Security, it is not fair to allow an able body immigrant to free monthly benefits for years that an average senior citizen is not entitled to.
@countrygal21 @Jim_Jordan @HuffPostPol The average rent for a one-bedroom apartment $979 in the US. Leaving the average senior citizen after medicare &amp; perscription part D premium, rent payment $252.00 monthly to pay for food, gas, electric, car + insurance, etc. Poverty guideline in the US for one person is $12,140.
@countrygal21 @Jim_Jordan @HuffPostPol The average senior citizen social security benefit is $1,422 per month less $122 medicare premium monthly + perscription coverage part D avg premium is $34.00 per  month + avg deductible $405.00/per year. After deductions for senior citizens to live on is $15,192 per year.
@countrygal21 @Jim_Jordan @HuffPostPol Each immigrant entitled to free health insurance &amp; prescription, housing, food, education, English classes, jobs training and given a green card to work while still receiving benefits. Immigrants entitled to apply for 18 government programs.
@countrygal21 @Jim_Jordan @HuffPostPol You're right, because citizens aren't entitled to the same benefits!

@Acosta Here is a better angle of the video Jim. You did push her with moderate force with your left wrist into her antecubical area of her left arm &amp;  attempted to remove her left hand off the microphone. No lying here. https://t.co/DwWXOkeVSa
I think @realDonaldTrump needs to look into this! https://t.co/uPFw9TTArw
@realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr  Yeah, ain't this some crap! Usually ex's stay the heck out of your life! I'd like to tell Obama that we are divorced almost 2 years now, and your sorry narcissist butt keeps coming back! #RESTRAININGORDERNEEDEDNOW!! https://t.co/PTyo1MWxNs
@newtnewtriot @realDonaldTrump It happened under Obama administration. You still failed to address why unemployment went 6.7% to 9% 23 months in office. Yes, that would be Obama's fault. Clearly facts are not your thing. I didn't vote for Trump, but I won't let bias media lie to me either. Now I will vote RED!
@newtnewtriot @realDonaldTrump And I'm sure you would be slamming Trump if those Obama employment numbers were Trumps, &amp; not give him no excuse as you are making for Obama by blaming a previous administration. Clearly facts don't matter to you. You tow a party line. Give the man credit where credit is due.
@newtnewtriot @realDonaldTrump FYI... it's accredited under the Obama administration &amp; goes down in history as fact. However, you seemed to miss the fact that unemployment went from 6.7% by end year in 2009 after taking office in January 2009 to 9% end of year in 2010. That didn't happen under Bush! #MATHFACT
@newtnewtriot @realDonaldTrump Did I blame Obama? I think you just assumed way too much here. #getoverthebutthurt
@newtnewtriot @realDonaldTrump Someone else challenged me on this topic using bias media twisted information. So I went out to the US Labor Bureau and downloaded the information myself. Here are the numbers. Stop reading BS. Research for yourself. https://t.co/ercTvGGzfU
@newtnewtriot @realDonaldTrump I believe charity begins at home. We had 43.1 million US citizens living in poverty in 2015 under Obama. Now under Trump the US poverty is down to 39.7 million people. Trump in 17 months has created half the jobs Obama created in 8 yrs.
@kathym4321 @ROHLL5 @YouTube Soros &amp; Clintons ripped off the people of Haiti!
@Acosta Your tweet appears to racist and gives the assumption you want us to think the kids are illegal.
@Acosta You know damn well, you get your FACTS from the AP wire and twist it! Fact check: Jim Acosta doesn't practice true journalism!
@newtnewtriot @realDonaldTrump BTW... stop using memes to prove your bias facts.  Your ignorance shows!
@newtnewtriot @realDonaldTrump Mexico offered them jobs &amp; asylum. If you watch local Mexican news, many claim they are coming here due to poverty. They are given free housing, medical, food and utilities if granted asylum here. How is that fair to our homeless &amp; families living in poverty? #USFIRST
@newtnewtriot @realDonaldTrump No, just the last two years this has taken place. My friend in Mexico and the Mexican people do not want this in their country either. There is nothing wrong with vetting people. But you should come legal &amp; not live off the tax dollars of the American people.

@Pulman1952 @realDonaldTrump Read, stop watching CNN. Currently the average working wage in Mexico is $4.10 for an entire day. Now, automakers must pay 30% of workers $16.00 per hour. There are several more key points as well.  https://t.co/aqlAoE5gC4
@RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump There several major differences. Mexico will now have to pay a production wage of a minimum of $16.00 per hour x 8 hrs = $128.00 per day. That should help those Mexican workers who's average wage for an 8 hour DAY is $4.10 for entire 8 hours worth of work. https://t.co/aqlAoE5gC4

@frankthorp It is a done deal if they issue her a subpoena. She opened this can of worms, she needs to deal with the process &amp; not on her terms. A man's future &amp; the United States judicial system is a stake, she knew that going in. If she is telling the truth, then why seek an attorney?

@VegasMurseRN @MarilynnePryor @jpl4rd21 @realDonaldTrump Then you should take your own advice when it comes to Trumps tax returns. "Because I know people more qualified than I am have investifated it with a fine tooth comb and found no wrong doing. Case closed."  Nuff said!
@Acosta Then why is CNN so bias in reporting the news. All I see is Trump bashing.

@MarilynnePryor @VegasMurseRN @jpl4rd21 @realDonaldTrump Awe... I told the truth about HRC supporters and hurt your feelings. Who's the idiot &amp; is avoiding the truth? That would be you. Why not go the Clinton Foundation website &amp; see where the money is being spent? #haitiremembers
@SSDavis13 @VegasMurseRN @jpl4rd21 @realDonaldTrump But I see you avoided my question to begin with. #stopthehate #getagrip
@SSDavis13 @VegasMurseRN @jpl4rd21 @realDonaldTrump I think his billionaire status has been very well researched. Do you really think his taxes haven't been gone over with a fine tooth comb already by the IRS and what will it change? How long did it take to produce a birth certificate for Obama? It's a mute point and who cares?
@EylerLinda @VegasMurseRN @jpl4rd21 @realDonaldTrump Last I heard we got a tax break! But you go ahead and use the 2017 tax rate for 2018, otherwise that would make you a traitor to your theory.
@nyterabyte @VegasMurseRN @jpl4rd21 @realDonaldTrump Hmmm... seems there already is term limits for President. Our current President is a billionaire, no need to rip off the people.  I'm speaking of all the other poor bloks that are elected to Congress &amp; come out millionaires.
@Shinzo_Abe_PM @VegasMurseRN @jpl4rd21 @realDonaldTrump Was it it truly investigated is the better question.
@BirssDuncan Last anyone cared about who a politician screwed &amp; ruined a career was Gary Hart. Get with the times!

@nyterabyte @VegasMurseRN @jpl4rd21 @realDonaldTrump Not at all.
@SSDavis13 @VegasMurseRN @jpl4rd21 @realDonaldTrump Trump came into office with 7 Billion in his pocket, no need to profit off the people. Ask why some poor blok gets elected to Congress &amp; comes out a millionaire.
@kwantem @Athens7316 @DanRather @CNN @Acosta Mainstream Media has an obligation to the US citizens to take an unbias approach to reporting the news. They all have failed miserably.
@DanRather @Acosta @CNN No, you got it twisted. Those who incite &amp; condone violence would be mainstream media and their financial backer George Soros. When a CNN contributor openly supports &amp; speaks for Antifa, it is a betrayal to the people.
@Acosta Stop blaming everyone else when the finger is pointed back to you. Because it was you who betrayed the US citizens by reporting bias news, held to your own political agenda and those you serve when you resorted to lies to deceive. We the people are awake now.
@WhiteHouse Make sure to include mainstream media.
@VegasMurseRN @jpl4rd21 @realDonaldTrump Time will tell. However, I am tired of those working in politics, special interest groups and those representing us, having side deals and profiting off the US citizens. Term limits need to happen.
@VegasMurseRN @jpl4rd21 @realDonaldTrump The actual sale of is not the controversy. Corruption surrounding the process under which the US government approved the sale is. Those associated with the deal contributed millions to the Clinton Foundation &amp; paid speech Bill Clinton gave to the Russian investment bank involved.
@realDonaldTrump Agreed! Today it's the Russia card, tomorrow maybe Israel will be the blame for the Democrat loss instead of the truth they underestimated their strategy by paying the DNC &amp; fake dossier. Cheaters always get what they pay for. You buy dirt, the dirt ends up on you &amp; you lose.
@realDonaldTrump Agreed! The media is destroying their own credibility when they do not report on Hillary's behavior. Ignore the media &amp; do not give credence to the media rumors &amp; unbias reporting. Your success &amp; accomplishments alone discredits the vitriolic press.
@MiaFarrow @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends "Probable Neglect" These children are probably the most well cared for  than they have ever been before. What makes you think you are an authority on this issue? When you failed &amp; neglected to protect your own child from your pedophile ex-husband. Turn your mirror around.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Vitriolic media push their own politial agenda. @PutinRF gave his answer Russia did not influence our elections. The losing side needs to stop blaming others, &amp; accept, their strategies failed, &amp; they underestimated their opponent &amp; the people. #MEDIASTOPTHERHETORIC

Do people understand that Communist Russia fell? "On 11/28/1991, President Boris Yeltsin officially declared the end of the Soviet Union &amp; became the President of the Russian Federation. Yeltsin was a reformer and promised Western-styled democracy". #DotheyteachCivicsanymore?
@ASpookist Yes he does, but he doesn't own the Internet, the public does! Did you watch any of the congressional hearings with Facebook? Do you know about the fines that were imposed on Google? Government has a say in the matter. Therein my post.
@GothSwanson @ASpookist Opps sorry, I thought I was addressing your friend since you included her in the post. You don't know my policies, don't even go there. Next, becareful about addressing one's race. It will get you banded from Social Media.
@GothSwanson @ASpookist She might find we actually all have common ground and ideas!
@GothSwanson @ASpookist I was once in publishing for many years. The whole idea of honest journalism is lost in vitriolic, political hatred &amp; leading the people of the US down a path of destruction. Your friend should check herself before making smartass comments &amp; assumptions.
@GothSwanson @ASpookist What the problem now darlin'?  I'm not a racist, communist, socialist, nor a democrat! As a matter of fact, I can tell you have no idea what my race is! Mind your words! I ain't the one tweeting for boyfriends chicka! I don't use twitter very much, I use the message service.
@ASpookist You do realize the Internet is a Public domain which the people own.  Your right, I don't need to talk to you or friend.
@ASpookist Okay snowflake!
@GothSwanson @ASpookist Go watch cartoons with your friend.
@GothSwanson @ASpookist No, not at all with the current bias Mainstream &amp; Social media. But I would like my stockmarket &amp; and investment news!
@ASpookist No, I'm not mad, that be you! Philosophy? My oh my, big word for you. Goodnight darlin', real adults have jobs. You know, the place adults go to earn a paycheck to help pay for your free stuff you feel your entitled to. Someday, you will have to join the ranks. ;)
@ASpookist Yep, we adults keep informed on world news, Wall Street, economics, trade, GDP, PPP, parity rates, &amp; other adult stuff.  Hopefully you'll learn the real world stuff once you get to high school. I heard that new math Common Core can be tricky for you kids. Show your work! ;)
@ASpookist Damn and here all this time you gave me the impression you thought I was a Russian Bot! Make up your mind. Better yet, go watch your cartoons. It will be less of a challenge for you.
@ASpookist Entitled? Darlin', I ain't the one yelling out for Socialism and free crap! That be your Snowflakes! I For some unknown reason, I get stuck with the likes of you.
