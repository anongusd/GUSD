@KurtSchlichter My wife banned mine years ago, and she’s still a republican.
@clownsrevil1109 @CNN Uhh... Park
@Midvale67 @NBCNews Actually, it’s just a crazy woman, who thinks her shit don’t stink, throwing a fit because someone’s dog tried to hump hers....... Race was only brought up by whatever other crazy person wrote this story or assumed “it must be a race thing”.... because that’s what we do now.
@NBCNews Lol... so now we must identify the skin color of dog owners, so we can make news stories about them?
@anypigslft @CBSNews Mine was a bit higher
@ChrisCuomo Collusion is a gateway drug for the left. It opened the door for them to find any reason possible to disparage the person America elected to be president.
@BriannaWu @ght001 @GCustom @yamichi This is called back peddling, boys and girls....
@BriannaWu They’re already banned from use by civilians....... but kudos on you hard hitting investigations. Next, you’re going to do a line of cocaine and then tell us it should be illegal..
@JaniceDean I never liked coffee, until now.
@NBCNews Misleading headline. Read the article... NBC News is, yet again, intentionally stirring the pot.
@ananavarro Not as much as you look like Natalia Veselnitskaya, but nobody is accusing you of being at a meeting in Trump Tower. https://t.co/rRVUkdkNVR
@CNN Not sure if anyone told you guys. But, the President of the USA is meeting with the leader of NoKo, right now....
@tedlieu @GOP @realDonaldTrump If I were you, I’d use your superior negotiation skills to make the demand. Oh, wait........
@kirstiealley Chaka Kahn
Come on Karen! You’re drunk and need to just go to sleep! https://t.co/oynVG0L2oa
@MSNBC Pretty pathetic
@brianstelter @jaketapper Lol... but this hearing is stupid. Nobody knows if the guy is telling the truth. What’s the point of asking him questions, if the court already said he lies in congress?
@AP Lol... actually, the court painted Cohen as a liar. That’s why he’s going to prison.....
@CNNPolitics Sort of a weird thing to do a piece about.
@KamalaHarris If mueller says there was nothing between trump and Russia, then that’s it, right? Do you not trust Mueller?
@SenBlumenthal Did you happen to catch that tweet from potus yesterday? Crazy!
@MeetThePress @NBCNews Seriously? A refresher on the Russia investigation? For two years, the news has been non stop trump and Russia... I’m pretty sure most people that do care about it, are already up to speed. Lol
@EdKrassen Threatening litigation seems like part of a lawyers job to me....
@jaketapper Threatening litigation seems like part of a lawyers job to me....
@RitaPanahi My idea of beautiful and powerful is way way way different than this.
@josh_hammer @benshapiro He should just start calling him “My Fat Little Shitbag”. Apparently, that’s the term everyone expects to win him over and get rid of his nukes........
@realDonaldTrump Kids will be kids
@AC360 @tonyschwartz https://t.co/8hOFHNlwcy
@mkraju Congress calls a witness that has been convicted of lying to Congress, to ask him about lying to Congress.........
@AOC Uhh... he’s quoting it as a slam against you and the rest of the socialists.... Seriously.... You can’t possibly be this dense?
@SenGillibrand Well... The good news is that according to most of the Left nowadays, debt doesn’t mean anything. That’s why they think we can spend 30 trillion a Green Deal, free education, healthcare, and a free wage, just for breathing air.
@AprilDRyan “Uhm” is not a word.
@ebaumsworld @DLoesch You do, apparently.
@CNN “His dress” are two words that just don’t sound right together.
@MeetThePress @neal_katyal @WisenbergSol @jahimes @AsaHutchinson @chucktodd Hahaha this graphic
@TitaniaMcGrath @SebGorka Hmmmf....
@realDonaldTrump So, will this be in sync with the other fireworks in DC that day?
@realDonaldTrump I was convinced that Reagan had risen and was doing a pressor, until that very last word.
@RollingStone Lol... this is a serious article?
@RepSwalwell @NRA @GabbyGiffords @SpeakerPelosi Wait... what part of the article says this?
@kirstiealley Reverse interviews. A celeb interviewing regular people about their lives.
@willsommer O M G! Someone call somebody! There is a chef that doesn’t think the same as Will... Thank God there was some that could break this story. We shall all pay close attention, because details are still evolving. As we all know, facts will soon evolve as well.
@savagehenrycelt @BBCBreaking How about now? Ok for Madura to destroy food and supplies that Venezuela people need? Blame the US for that, too? How many people of his country should he kill for you, before it’s not everyone else’s fault?
@RT_com I think we can safely assume that this was no accident. Over to you, Bob!
@brianklaas @Lawrence This stuff doesn’t count in the USA though. We learned that from the Clinton foundation... everything is fine and fair game.
@macsdaughter @BretBaier @SenGillibrand Lol... by all means. Do exactly as a random twitter person demands...
@psychonot23 @nytimesworld Is that why their government is firing on its own people, just for trying to leave or receive food?
@nytimesworld Isn’t socialism awesome? This is how it always ends. When will people learn, that nobody wants to be oppressed or controlled?
@satyashr5 @BBCBreaking Not sure if you noticed... that’s not the US firing at its own people.... that’s a government, refusing to allow its people to leave or to allow help to come in.
@BBCBreaking Ahh yes... The perks of socialism......
@ComfortablySmug Bravo.... Bravo... I see what you did there
@MichaelAvenatti It’s ok.. seriously... there are a million other careers that might suit you.
@AOC This should just become a habit......
@CNNPolitics We will remember this tweet when Biden wins the nomination
@trish_regan @MariaCorinaYA @DouglasESchoen @NigerInnisCORE @BrittMcHenry Tune in where?
@funss @Reuters Yep.. TDS
@kathygriffin @JussieSmollett This might be the last kiss he has before jail.

@Cernovich Vacuum Sealer and electric canner
@USATODAY Might want to update your headline. He was taken to hospital twice and died in the hospital of liver and heart disease.
@brianstelter Hall monitor
@CNN This guy hired 2 black guys, to pretend to be 2 white guys, so he could accuse white Americans of being bias against black Americans. Now, he has a white lawyer, to protect him from being shamed by black America. 2019 is shaping up to be FiRE!

@CNNPolitics Pretty sure they can just “Get Over It”. Wait, did I just use a song title in a tweet? I hope The Eagles doesn’t get too mad at me!
@SebGorka Were
@AP Gotta wonder how many people will now doubt future reports of hate crimes. What Smollett has done is make every other report of a hate crime harder to believe.
@RealCandaceO Remember that Northam guy? What ever happened to him?
@realDonaldTrump Put web cams at the border, otherwise, nobody believes it.
@MSNBC Maybe because withholding throughout the year was also down?
@secupp Lol whose facts?
@brianstelter I know a guy, who knows a person, who knows Brian Stelter, and they say he squats to pee...........
@CBSNews Just so we understand. Smollett is claiming that this is all #FakeNews? Who would have thought that this event would have brought him and Trump together!
But this tweet though! https://t.co/LGv4fPdxLn
@RubinReport #StopTheHate
@VictorBlackwell Totally ignoring the fact that he tried to place the blame on Trump supporters? How many times does this have to happen?
@brianstelter @Acosta Wait.... I thought you said The Price is Right was more important? You were a much better writer yesterday, and even someone likable.
@mkraju Lol

@RadioFreeTom @JoeNBC Dumb
@CoryBooker Everyone else has coffee, but you have water.....
@Mikel_Jollett @pattonoswalt Then I guess that also works in reverse. The left can’t complain about a government doing what it wants? We are all a bunch of hypocrites.
@TIME Proving again how much he is just like the rest of us!
@gtconway3d Well.. that assumes the lower courts are never wrong, which we know isn’t true. Especially since the 9th circuit in particular is so frequently overturned.
@brianstelter Brian Stelter: “hmmmm.. should I tweet about the horrors that those Angel Moms are suffering, or should I just say fuck it and switch over and tweet a game show..... Game show it is!”

@ComfortablySmug And his new running mate, Faith Spotted Eagle!

@SenatorCarper @SenateDems Here we go again! We should just let Hillary be AG, so you all can finally feel safe.

@trish_regan @POTUS This woman is a GOP dream!
@GovernorVA So, you’re not going to resign?
@GeraldoRivera @AOC She wants to ban anything that farts.
@neeratanden You know you want to say the words... “FAKE NEWS!”....... It’s ok, you can say it.
@CoryBooker But, we already heard the story of the very first guy released under the act. He was Trumps guest at SOTU.
@business Capitalism! Free Market!
@DocumentaryNow @IFC Isn’t this the guy from that Independence Day movie?
@AOC You said the world was going to end in 12 years. It’s hard to even take this serious now.
@GarySinise @YouTube Well deserved applause 👏
@business This will do wonders for Buzzfeeds efforts to stay in business!

@SenatorSinema @AIPAC Well stated, Senator!
@CNN The thieves will not reveal the location of the trees until Daniel agrees to enter the tournament.
@cnni I’ll bet they tossed them off a cliff, near a waterfall, and won’t reveal the location unless Daniel agrees to enter the tournament.
@IlhanMN Holy bucket of crap, Batman! Gonna need a big cleanup in isle 5 for this.
@DLoesch He’s still on the phone with Jake from State Farm.
@SarahElla84 @IlhanMN TFW you realize you use a gif of an Israeli actress to represent strength for a person who condemns Israel.
@ABC @FiveThirtyEight Option B: Brute Force!
@amyklobuchar If I choose not to, please don’t hurt me!
@amyklobuchar 1 minute before this pic: “Everyone smile and look like you’re happy, or else!”
@business So, she’s actually going to try this, eh?
@cnni Was the runners first name Chuck, by any chance?
@SebGorka She won’t appear until 2020. Then as she resigns, the left can use the Republicans “no appointment in an election year” plot.
@tomgreenlive @CBSBigBrother @CBSCelebBB Mooch screwed ya! If he hadn’t bailed, I think you had this thing.
@SenWarren @IlhanMN @WellsFargo This is an outrage! Bank tellers should be allowed to snag a 20 here and there, if they want!
@ewarren You mean like allowing a person to claim a race they choose, so they can take advantage of benefits for that race? We agree! Those people should be prosecuted!
@ewarren We will watch for the smoke signals.
@vnbateman This reminds me, I need to clean under my refrigerator.
@foshee_cynthia @realDonaldTrump I’m guessing the “trespassers will be shot” signs help a lot. It’s a military installation and they will literally shoot you for crossing. Btw, it does have a barrier.
@HeartnSoul77 @amyklobuchar #BelieveHer  remember Kavanaugh!
@maggieNYT Was potus there?
Just so we’re clear. After all this time, all we needed to do was force KKK members to watch Roots, and they would be cured? https://t.co/lkTZTUSYdS
@ElntheSolutions @tedlieu Actually, he’s not my dear leader. But if he were, I wouldn’t want him playing on social media during a hearing either.
@tedlieu Because Ted Lieu is so bored during a congressional hearing, he is playing on twitter.... very professional...
@CNNPolitics Impeachable offense!
@margare24279378 @JakeAkex @USATODAY I saw lots of standing O’s. Seemed like a decently received speech.
@JakeAkex @USATODAY So you’re saying, they stand, sit, applaud, etc, at the direction of Nancy Pelosi? It’s a shame those ladies don’t get to think for themselves. That’s just wrong.
Perhaps ABC News doesn’t quit know what “bullying” is? https://t.co/9mZY8aLIJj
@JakeAkex @USATODAY They just timed it perfectly, right after he complimented them in his speech, huh?
@NBCNews Don’t threats need to have an “or else”, either stated or implied, to actually be a threat?
@CNNPolitics Certainly, there must be something they all have in common. If we could just identify that, we might be able to avoid this in the future.....
@ComfortablySmug Chatting on Skype with Anthony Wiener.
@WSJ Did she have a phone call to make or something?
@ComfortablySmug If Wolverine and Eddie Munster had a baby.
@ananavarro What a thing to pick on..... lol
@ComfortablySmug This is what it looks like when a party begins to devour itself.
@CNNPolitics Wait a minute.... I thought inciting people was the media’s job!
@Acosta Something tells me this isn’t a new thing.
@neeratanden You mean, “if you like your plan, you can keep your plan?”..... haha.. I think we’ve seen this movie before.
@barstoolsports @ZeroBlog30 Didn’t we see this halftime show last night?
@DanaPerino I think you just discovered coney dog sauce!
@CNN Between this and the pencil machine, I’ll bet this vending company is making a killing!
@CNN Imagine how long the line is to use this machine! Did anyone mention to the school that most recreational reading is, or soon will be, done digitally?
@brithume They will write a story about it later. For now, they just want to put a headline out there.
@jaketapper @BobbyScott @MarkWarner @timkaine He’s waiting on a DNA test. If he’s at least 1/1024 African American, he believes his party will once again accept him and forgive his past mistakes. He will also be publishing his own cookbook soon.
@CNN @CNNOpinion You can hate the guy all you want. But as long as he keeps winning, he’s going to keep making you eat your words. The same goes for Brady.
@CNNPolitics Ok, here is a solution to this whole fiasco. Northam needs to take a DNA test. If he has even 1/1024 African American blood, he can run in 2020, without backlash from his party. This plan has been proven to work.
@business Unless the damn things are going to walk to the kitchen and make me a sandwich, I’m not wasting electricity on them.
@EricHolder We learned that old yearbooks are a great way to ruin a person’s life.
@CNBC @CNBCMakeIt This explains the price increase on Mtn Dew.

@brianefallon Oops...this turned out to be Northam’s prom photo!
@Reuters A pig in a tutu? Good night, twitter......
@Comey TFW even James Comey thinks you shouldn’t keep your job.
An honest mistake, right? https://t.co/8usaXuY4wQ
@greggutfeld @KatTimpf Notice that most of the media is NOT printing a (D) next to his name? On Cooper 360 the Chiron actually said he was a R.
@NBCNews If this guy were a Republican, every media outlet would make sure they printed an (R) next to his name.
@GovernorVA When you were running your mouth and accusing Gillespi, Sessions, Trump, and others as racist, were you quietly remembering how hot it was under all that black face paint?
@ewarren Ironically, Northam took a DNA test, and guess what? He’s more Native American than you are!
🚨 🚨 🚨 https://t.co/WHQDdAEKHf
This ad against Northam’s opposition has new meaning, now.		Va. gov campaign ad featuring truck with Confederate flag chasing kids sparks controversy  https://t.co/jk6tIQqM6V
@guypbenson Maybe Northam used actual home video?
@politico Whew! Thank god!
@Alyssa_Milano @BreitbartNews Me too, considering how many others they could have chosen. Possibly they were trying to keep it SFW?
@RealJamesWoods @CNN @nytimes If his Governorship is over, I guess you could say, his political career was aborted?
@business She sure likes to label herself..
@CNN The goal is, to keep Mr Northam comfortable while Republicans and Democrats have a discussion.
When you’re a Democrat and this is what CNN is asking, you have some serious issues ahead....... https://t.co/xu23WNNyDv
@MikevWUSA This county has lost its mind. At some point, we have to ask “can people change and can we look past a stupid decision?” If so, it has to be applied to everyone. Not just one party, race, religion, sex, etc....

@BuckSexton I think they will say; “Putin probably wats out of the treaty”

@GovernorVA So, you’re like Dr Kevorkian, minus the “Dr” and you kill them the beginning of their life?

@AOC Didn’t he grow up in the Projects?
@philipaklein Wait... so let me get this straight.... Spending money increases debt?
@CNN 3rd time’s a charm!
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump What you’re saying is: It’s costing us more to shut the government down than it would to build a wall? Hmmmmmm 🙄
@CNN The media will decide who wins.
@brianstelter Doesn’t matter. The media determines who wins and loses.
@CNNPolitics They all say that...

@MikeBloomberg 2016 when Dems thought Gary Johnson would cause Trump to lose: “We are sick of the 2 party system!”		2019 when Howard Schultz is running as an Independent: “how dare a liberal run as a 3rd party and threaten our chance of beating Trump!”
@CBSNews That’s a seatbelt violation at minimum.
@sahilkapur Finally! A candidate that isn’t trying to convince us to vote for him based on his ideas!
