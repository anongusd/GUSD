Every death caused by tobacco is preventable. Progress has been made but the context has changed, so we need to act.
Going forward, @US_FDA will be able to review and regulate new tobacco products before they hit store shelves.
This rule means all tobacco sales to those 26 and under will require a photo ID.
Under federal law, retailers will no longer be able to sell e-cigs, cigars, or other covered tobacco products to anyone under age 18.
Today we are finalizing a rule that extends @US_FDA authority to regulate ALL tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, hookah, and cigars.
In 2009, a bipartisan Congressional act entrusted @US_FDA to regulate tobacco products in order to protect public health.
Tobacco remains the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S., taking almost half a million lives every year.
We have drastically reduced smoking rates and saved hundreds of thousands of lives, but we have more work to do.
We‚Äôre taking the next logical step to protect our kids from the dangers of tobacco. https://t.co/7Nbhn6TZJE https://t.co/Aks7Dutue6
