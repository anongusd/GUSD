Above all, is Don Giovanni a charming seducer or a grim, desperate rapist? Happily tonight’s production has picked option B, and I can’t wait (spoiler alert) for him to fall into the pit of hell.
Is Donna Elvira a crazy woman scorned, begging for Giovanni to return (as in prior productions), or is she the modern Shitty Media Men List? Is Dona Ana “crying rape” to fool her fiancé or a victim? Is Zerlina a golddigger or a working class woman with few real options to resist?

“Patriarchy works by making women think that the man who will override her will is the one who loves her most....by making men mistake ego and showmanship for vulnerability and accountability.” So great to read ⁦@ProfessorCrunk⁩ ⁦@TheCut⁩  https://t.co/LoLlsxWXsW
Finally, as a reporter I'm grateful to women like @sophiegayter who put themselves on the line to expose wrongdoing. This story isn't over yet.
Anyway, keep in mind that "severe or pervasive" is a legal term of art in sexual harassment cases, and the women whose Charlie Rose-related lawsuits were settled recently aren't the only ones who might be eligible to bring a case.
To its great credit (reporting on yourself is awkward!), CBS News, in an on air segment by @vladduthiersCBS, reported on accounts from women at the network who *do* describe it as a toxic environment https://t.co/zfYtOQp7fE
The CBS investigators told women with confidential settlements they could not indemnify them against lawsuits from people they'd agreed not to disparage. That also limited what was in the investigation. https://t.co/v8kvNhRJlS
@AmyJBrittain That woman, Sophie Gayter, was one of several who declined to speak to the investigators. She told the Times, “I’ve been keeping my mouth shut, because I just don’t trust anything from that organization whatsoever.” I've spoken to others who agree. https://t.co/v8kvNhRJlS
@AmyJBrittain One woman who said Rose groped her at 60 Minutes: “I had been there long enough to know that it was just the way things went. People said what they wanted to you, people did what they wanted to you.”	https://t.co/9xZFqHKPOm
The investigators hired by CBS's board say that "harassment and retaliation are not pervasive at CBS." Reupping my story with @AmyJBrittain, based on interviews with 107 current and former CBS employees, several of whom warned managers about Charlie Rose: https://t.co/9xZFqHKPOm

RBG says she and Marty went out to “Goldberg’s pizza” when young Jane’s book group took over their apartment to discuss Our Bodies Ourselves.
Nina Totenberg has known RBG since Reed v Reed. “If you want to know how long that is, look it up!” RBG says, “50 years.”
RBG is talking about how Bill Clinton chose her for the Supreme Court with Hillary sitting in the audience.
RBG says she told Armie Hammer he was a lot taller than Marty was. He replied, she says, “you’re a lot shorter than Felicity Jones.”
“That accounts for how you think you can still survive on three hours of sleep?” asks Totenberg about RBG’s law school days caring for both sick husband and three year old. RBG: “I can.”

@DouthatNYT There are certainly stylistic differences, but Trump is another white elite-educated man with inherited wealth and connections, and yet somehow it’s diverse meritocracy that has failed us.

It’s telling that everyone sees my observation as being about partisanship, when it’s actually about how much leeway white men are allowed to misbehave. In any case, Breyer wasn’t accused of assault. https://t.co/juaukQQZeB
@B0B0atStern697 She apologized, which I thought was the right thing to do. She was not up for a vote at the time. She has sometimes voted with the GOP appointees — e.g. to strike down an abortion clinic law that she thought encroached on the 1st amendment.

An entire portion about James Roche was redacted in the transcript of Kavanaugh's questioning and I still have no idea why. Kavanaugh just seemed to reference it.

Being surprised that Ford is credible truly speaks volumes of what he and his allies think of women. https://t.co/kCVs5Incfk
Conservatives have tried to paint Blasey Ford as the hapless victim of Democrats like Feinstein. Today it's clear, as she said in her statement, "I am no one's pawn."
"I didn't understand why I would need lawyers." Because she didn't think she would be on trial as she is.
The point of Mitchell's questioning — are you even that traumatized? — is disputed by the raw emotion Blasey Ford has already shown.
@nancylevine @ChuckGrassley He was referring to how Blasey Ford's story leaked out.
Unselfawareness thy name is Grassley.
Sheldon Whitehouse's role here is to point out the essential lawlessness of this process, on the same terms that the prosector is using.

Reporters tracking down Christine Blasey Ford at work and home were doing their job in an ordinary way, and yet when it comes to a sexual assault survivor, it's hard not to question whether ordinary is acceptable.
In her first interview, Christine Blasey Ford called the prospect of coming forward an "annihilation." Today she is refusing to be annihilated, despite all the costs.
There's something heartbreakingly idealistic about Christine Blasey Ford believing the senators in charge would genuinely want to hear from her before they voted.

I am, too.
Every woman I am in contact with is sobbing right now.
This is the first time we will hear Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's voice.
Feinstein, who during the hearings apologized to Kavanaugh about the circumstances, is now rising to the occasion, with the right balance of facts and quiet anger.
RT @emptywheel: Grassley in opening statement says there was no whiff of allegation about inappropriate sexual behavior.		False, there was…
Feinstein: "Our institutions have not progressed in how they treat women who come forward... in essence they are put on trial and forced to defend themselves."
Republicans have been terrified of Christine Blasey Ford because she can't be dismissed as an outsider. In telling her truth, she is a traitor to the order and class she came from.
Grassley is showing his sensitivity to women by interrupting the female ranking member.
It's true that the FBI doesn't reach conclusions. But it would have interviewed more than two people.
So what I'm getting is that Grassley is the victim testifying today.
CBF testimony: "Senator Feinstein wrote that she would not share the letter without my consent. I greatly appreciated this commitment. All sexual assault victims should be able to decide for themselves whether their private experience is made public."
As Chuck Grassley condemns Dianne Feinstein's holding on to the letter, note that Christine Blasey Ford's statement says that she fully approves of how Feinstein handled it.
Christine Blasey Ford didn't have to be sitting up there alone with everything on her shoulders, her against him. This is a choice to make it he said, she said.
It's so fitting that in the Trump era, we don't get a factual record, only the opportunity to assess whose performance is better.

Harris: "Can you think of any laws that give the government the power to make decisions about the male body?" Kavanaugh: "I'm not thinking of any right now, Senator."
Kavanaugh says that's because RBG had previously written about Roe. Harris is ready for that. "You too have written about Roe." (Praising the dissent in his speech, I presume.)
Now Harris is reading what RBG actually said at her nomination hearings. "It's a decision that she must make for herself. And when Government controls that decision for her, she's being treated as less than a fully adult human responsible for her own choices."
Kavanaugh is praising the concurrence in Griswold (the case striking down birth control bans that was a precursor to Roe) but wouldn't say he approved of it, would only say he agreed with Alito and Roberts.
Harris just asked Kavanaugh if he’s aware that a term he used (“racial spoils system”) is commonly used by white supremacists. (He said he isn’t.)

The Garza case, in which Kavanaugh made up a new requirement to delay a migrant minor from accessing an abortion but did so with SO MUCH COMPASSION, seems a lot like an example o a judge making law rather than following precedent. But being really nice about it.
And you'll hear from that lawyer when she testifies later this week! https://t.co/Q8tj4wBulD
It's bizarre that Kavanaugh says that he was following parental consent precedent when she had already complied with it. Then again, Scott Lloyd, the Trump official trying to block her, said he saw himself as the detained migrants' foster parent. https://t.co/10UAZQNvrd
Kavanaugh emphasizes that Jane Doe is a minor. But she had complied with Texas laws governing abortions of minors: She sought and received a judicial bypass.
Durbin turns to the Jane Doe case of a minor in immigrant detention who reported being raped and sought an abortion. Even after she had jumped through all procedural hoops, delaying 7 weeks, Kavanaugh sought to delay further.

Who is the intended audience for this?? https://t.co/S3wyvyYjpz
Ted Cruz is right about this part: Republicans were motivated to turn out because of judges and not enough Democrats were to make a difference.
Ted Cruz claims Obamacare forced nuns to pay for abortion inducing drugs. Actually, the Obama administration asked them to fill out exemption forms for birth control that would be paid for by the insurer.
Ted Cruz is crediting Trump for saying during the campaign that he would appoint judges that would interpret the constitution and not be results oriented. What about all the times Trump openly (and unprecedentedly) promised to appoint judges who would overturn Roe?
