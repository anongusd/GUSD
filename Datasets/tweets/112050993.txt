@ThisWeekABC @GStephanopoulos Oh course that weren't concerns for #Trump. Why would his criminality and backdoor connections to foreign governments be concern for him? Just how much is #Trump taking in the backdoor from these governments?
@ThisWeekABC Trump lied when he claims he had nothing to do with granting Kushner clearance even after it was advised he had been compromised and it wouldn't be a wise idea. Yes he can do so, but that is not what it is about. It's about #TrumpLiesEverytimeHeSpeaks
@GOP @GOPChairwoman You can't claim to be for defending a child and once it's born, throw it out the window. #Trump himself proposed cutting $7 billion from spending because of a deficit created by the #TaxScam. 	https://t.co/4jm5vAtqth
@GOP @GOPChairwoman #Ruusianbot answer this question, why is the GOP trying to gut entitlement programs? Why did it try to cut CHIP? Why does it no longer care about toddlers, or grade school children by cutting funding for lunch programs? SSN is self sufficient and is threatening to be cut why?,
@CBSNews My refund was down from last year and I have the max taken out. Yes the government gets a free loan on my refund, but I still lost almost $200 from my refund.
@realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @MELANIATRUMP then just why the hell didn't you fire him a long time ago? Could it be that you trusted him with all your dark secrets? He's talking and you're starting to run as you can feel the House is closing in on you. https://t.co/OXrZQtDglT
@realDonaldTrump Failed lawyer? He was your lawyer and did everything that you asked him to do. He paid off a porn star and a playmate to keep it out of the press, He LIED to your wife @FLOTUS @MELANIATRUMP for you. He's kept you out of jail pretty much since he was hired. If he was such a liar..
@JohnCornyn That should be refused. Autocorrect and not proofreading. https://t.co/3MxotjBCnA
@JohnCornyn Let’s talk about how Mitch refuses to even consider any of Obama’s picks or allow a vote for his #SCOTUS nomination. He stole his pick.
@SecretaryPerry @realDonaldTrump And here you and #Drumpf are trying to keep coal mine and powered plants open. You can see how going green is much better for the environment.
@SecretaryPerry In fact, #TVA is shutting down two plants as they're old and no longer needed. https://t.co/KQQcc7zIDO
@SecretaryPerry And yet it is being done while closing coal mines and coal mine fired plants.	https://t.co/WguOmOhtiy
@NBCNews Kim got what he wanted. No inspections and a canceled war game with S Korea. Meanwhile, the king of the art of the deal got nothing. https://t.co/30hFr66OA7
@tedcruz My ancestors fought defending the Alamo. They also bought supplies and provided cattle for food to the Texians and the Tejanos. In fact, they were part of the original Tejanos from the 1700s. I can tell you this, they would not like you and would defeat you in your political run.
@realDonaldTrump Hahaha, no. No it isn't;'t falling apart. Mueller is still filing charges and getting convictions, Plus, Cohen has not been discredited. And nothing has been found on Hillary or the Democrats.
@nytimes Bullshit. Let him rot in jail for the rest of his life.
@RepArrington 🤣🤣🤣Like they're going to listen to the request of a deranged lunatic that they already own.
@GOP @SenJoniErnst #russianbot understand that Kim is just using #Trump like the cheap two dollar whore that he is. It wasn’t until #Trump, that NK was made to be the power that it is now. They’ve gotten what they’ve wanted. No inspections of their weapons facilities. Fucking dumbass is he.
@LouDobbs @DiamondandSilk Hahahaha two stupid tokens that think that they’re something. As soon as #Trump is out of office, they’re back to where they were.
@SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump Trump just ended war games with S Korea. Those games were a show of force which is needed to be shown against NK. He also allowed them to cancel inspections of their nuclear weapons and test sites. That’s not wining the art of the deal. That’s losing it. https://t.co/nQKUxSHtFA

@seanhannity Hey Sean, are you getting ready for your congressional subpoena to testify what Cohen said was a lie? If so, then one of you, you it seems, would be perjuring themselves before congress and that's a federal offense. Plus, you'd have to turn over any documents or tapes he said it. https://t.co/KrQxKUUoJ0
@senatemajldr We’re the only developed country without universal healthcare. The only one and it works for all other countries.
@senatemajldr And it would give the government more control over drug and treatment pricing. It would lower the cost of them. Is that a bad thing? I’d give up my plans to have universal care and lower cost.
@LouDobbs @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Hey gabe them want they wanted. No inspections and no checking up on anything that they do when it comes to their test sites or any facilities. Just like a good little #PutinsPuppet

@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @GOP And if you are calling him a liar, then list each and everything that he said was a lie and counter the truth.
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump He was #Trump's lawyer for decades. Ws given a seat as a finance manager for the RNC. And you call him a liar? It isn't until he turned on the shit for brains we have as a #POTUS that the @GOP started to call him a liar. If he had been lying, he should have been fired long ago https://t.co/UVTUOBz7Qm
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Cohen was a finance officer for the RNC as late as 2017. He was #Trump's lawyer for decades. If he is now a liar and a distraction, why are you just now coming out and railing against him? Because #Russianbot you know that you're the one lying now. https://t.co/OrTCHnLkCr
@GOP If he was lying, the why did #Trump keep him as an attorney for as long as he did?

@JohnCornyn Do you or do you not approve and support the land grab of Texans along the border to build an unnecessary #Wall? Do you believe that theft of land is a valid reason for a non-emergency as stated by #Trump?
@GOP Oh yeah, #Russianbot account, you  suck.
@GOP I’d be happy to pay taxes towards a government healthcare care as it would save individuals money and it would give the government the ability to negotiate lower drug cost. And healthcare cost all around.
@politico Great success? Nothing was accomplished and there was only an agreement to sit down in the future to talk about the possibility of denuclearization. There was no promise to act. Kim has been legitimized as a world leader, and continues to expand test sites and weapons.

@CBSNews #Trump legitimized Kim by not only meeting with him, but making a big spectacle of it. He gave capitulated when he canceled war games that were scheduled and got nothing in return for it. Calling Trump an idiot is a compliment. Utter and complete dumbass puppet is more like it.
@JohnCornyn @FreeBeacon ..what the New Green deal is is not something that is set in stone, but something that is meant to get congress working on feasible ways to reduce CO2 emissions. It's something that is to get a serious discussion on how to handle climate change. https://t.co/xsryaKkEc4
@JohnCornyn @FreeBeacon The Free Bacon was the first one to invest in the #SteeleDossier. They are the ones that first brought it to light.

@marcorubio Qaddafi was sodomized, tortured and killed without trial after he was captured. Are you in favor of doing the same thing to a fellow human being? While he needed I be removed, it’s disgusting that you imply the same thing needs to be done in #Venezuela.

@seanhannity Even Reagan banned assault weapons and was in favor of a national background check. He fully supported the Brady Bill.

@GOP @realDonaldTrump Through legal ports of entry. In shipping containers, semi trucks, passenger vehicles, airplanes, people swallowing bags, and many other means.

@tedcruz #Trump only wants a #Wall as a monument to his own ego. Nothing more. Claiming that he wants it to stop illegals, drugs and anything else is a lie. Just like that cake was. Trump is a liar and a failed deal maker. https://t.co/JGVibmNRlr
@tedcruz You want to stop drugs? Make all drugs legal and allow the government to setup safe houses for people to use drugs. Let the government be the pusher. Seeing how it’s big business, the government can earn billions off of it./s But seriously, stop the useless drug war. https://t.co/52Dfm42d27

@GOP @KellyannePolls I keep hearing that it’s enough to kill x number of Americans, but the fact of the matter is that the amount of drugs seized goes towards a much smaller number of junkies that use the drugs. And it was at a legal point of entry.

@SenatorWicker @CBP Sen Robber, there’s a big difference between a border #Wall in an urban area and an area in #BFN. Open areas are seldom used because there’s nothing around. A border wall doesn’t stop trafficking. It happens through open ports and tunnels in urban areas. Usually at ports of call

@LouDobbs @KenPaxtonTX you know that's a lie. There are a large number of mismatches that occurred which make seem like a person was not eligible to vote. That's what can happen when someone moves and doesn't update their address, or when a person changes their name. https://t.co/AG553Sig8R
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump According to #trump, this is just temporary. He has already stated that he will be willing to shutdown the government again if he doesn't get what he wants.

@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends So to come back to this. That's not quite how it works. The report states that there were also people that did not have proper identification at the time of voting showing that they were legal citizens. This happens at times once some has received their naturalization paperwork.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Those are the numbers from when he came into office, not when he left.

There’s always a possibility that someone registered to vote when they aren’t eligible. There also aren’t enough that will allow you to claim the popular vote either.
@LouDobbs @POTUS @realDonaldTrump He is a pretend CEo. I seriously doubt that he has a billion dollars. The Apprentice just built him up to appear that way. It was all an act.

@GStephanopoulos @ThisWeekABC Stone is banking on a pardon from #Trump should he be sentenced to jail. So far, #Trump has not pardoned those connected to his campaign.

@realDonaldTrump No, we don’t. The #Wall is just a vanity project and won’t do anything to curb illegal immigration or drugs crossing the border. The majority of drugs come through legal ports of entry. You want it because it’ll be attributed to you. That’s all. Walls come down, remember that.
@realDonaldTrump just quit. be the loser that you have been and always will be.
You have no concept on how the #TrumpShutdown affected people. NONE whatsoever. #TrumpResignNow and save what little face that you have. Again, you wouldn't last one month on your own, with only $1500 to last the month to pay rent, utility bills, food and other expenses.. #smh
That if there was truly a crisis at the border the way described it, that previous presidents would have already built a wall. If you believe that previous presidents simply ignored the issue or simply couldn't get it done, then you're clearly mistaken. #TrumpCaves ... #wall
Let's get something straight. This #Wall is not about border security. This WALL is about a vanity project or a "memorial" to stoke your ego. That's what this #WALL is about. The #BorderCrisis is not real. It never has been. Had it been real, then you can be assured #TrumpCaved
@CNN So, a white man was arrested. he was treated with respected when he was arrested and released? But if he was a black man, he'd of been beaten and roughed up. He'd of been thrown in the back of a patrol car? Nixon gave victory signs, but he resigned before he went down. https://t.co/2liwRwsMeW

@seanhannity Nothing has changed along the since last year. Why wasn't there enough of a crisis at the border to do it last year? Because the @GOP had both houses and was placating #Trump. They believed that they were gods and nothing could stop them. But you know what? An election came.. 1/2
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump The #Wall has nothing to do with border security. It's only a vanity project to build some sort of supposed lasting memorial to him. THAT"S ALL!! It can be stopped by the next #POTUS and it will.

@RepRWilliams @POTUS Roger, have you even read the proposed bill? It cuts asylums from 50k to 15k a year. It severally cuts those covered by #DACA from 1.7 million to 700k. It’s #DOA. It’s not meant to open the government, but to create a further divide. The right thing is to #OPENTHEGOVERMENT now
@GOP @realDonaldTrump #Russianbot, the bills literally guts #DACA. It strips away pretty much every single protection that they have. It’s not a compromise. It’s a poison pill that tries to get people to vote for it without bothering to read what it does. https://t.co/BOVmcxKuDy
@senatemajldr @POTUS It not going to pass. It further reduces immigration to the US. It cuts the dreamers from 1.7 million to about 700k. It gives temporary protection and no path to full citizenship. It limits asylum seekers from 50k a year to 15k a year. It’s done this on purpose. https://t.co/c1JpuA4Myz
@Callen27G @NBCNews No he didn’t. Had he done what he was supposed to, the #NYFD would of had radios that worked in the tower and they would have pulled out with fewer lives lost.
@OutFrontCNN @ErinBurnett And that Trump is going to set the record straight. It's done on purpose. You know, criss cross. https://t.co/CrAwc7AEWd
@OutFrontCNN @ErinBurnett Typical Rudy. His job isn't to tell the truth. It's to sow disinformation. He states that something happened, and then not long after, he states that it didn't happen after it has been covered by the media. This is so that #Trump can come behind him and say Rudy is wrong. https://t.co/XPfzT2wWXa
@GOP @kayleighmcenany They have sent multiple bills to reopen the government. I bet that #WhereIsMitch will go nuclear on any @GOP that includes funding for the wall. Which is what he could have done at any time during the last two years. This is just to try and make it like it's the Dems fault.
@ActuallyNPH And for you to do right, is to bring us another episode of, Dr. Horrible's Sing along Blog, Neil. Oh, and Dr. King was an amazing man. We need a voice like his today. It's sad that to this day, we've still not achieved his dream. https://t.co/pMwp88A6eV
@LouDobbs @DiamondandSilk @realDonaldTrump Maybe they best be keepin' to demselves and minding they own bidness. Maybe they'd be smart 'nuff to UNDERSTAND and ask,  #WhereIsMitch? He the one that keepin' this #TrumpMcConnellPenceGOPShutdown goin'. Best be keepin' to demselves. https://t.co/8XSUEzs32E
@realDonaldTrump There's a difference between a having a wall in an urban area, and one in the middle of #BFN. Even then, they don't stop near what your claim they will. There are still tunnels yet to be found and it's just as easy to go around it. Plus there are ladders too. https://t.co/irPKkxRH3i
@GOP @realDonaldTrump This has to be a #Russianbot. It's retweeted this a countless number of times. Calling a brief three year extension for a permanent #Wall, is not reasonable. It was meant to be rejected. That way he can try to point the finger at @TheDemocrats. #TrumpMcConnellPenceGOPShutdown
@CajunFiddle @GOP @kayleighmcenany I have not touched that issue nor will I. I have also not watched any video or read any story on it. Regardless, one does not disrespect an elder. That's how I was brought up. They can support whomever they want. The hat has lost its original meaning. Not that I support #POTUS. https://t.co/nDZc2om0iM
@DailyCaller Hey Daily Crap, why don't you promote your soft porn swimsuit articles? you know, the ones about painted on swimsuits? Or the ones about what some female celebrity was wearing or not wearing? Don't read your crap, because it's all crappy crap crap. https://t.co/wNKTawTald
@GOP @kayleighmcenany We're seeing that the #RepublicanParty is no longer the party of Reagan and it's drifting not to the right, but to the extreme hatred and racism. Can we say, nazisism? If it continues the way it's going, the hatred coming from the top will cause it to explode. https://t.co/8dMrJ7Q8yL
@GOP @VP Fuck the damn southern border. #OpenTheDamnGovernment and then talk about it later. People are being hurt by a president that is a #RussianAssetInTheWhiteHouse and is purposely doing harm to the country. Same for you, the #VP. #Shithead #Russianbot https://t.co/AtcfqvmWjX
@RedState Why? Do they plan to impeach him? Put him on trial? #Obama is no longer our president and has no plans to reenter politics. This is just asinine and vindictive. @LindseyGrahamSC Is planning to waste taxpayer money, when we need #OpenTheGovernmentMitch. https://t.co/flKi5GPMDe
@seanhannity Sean, are you getting ready to evict people from your HUD housing seeing as many aren't able to pay rent? It'd be a great time to do so so you can genrify all the properties. Hey, remodeling into condos cost money, but you can make it back by selling condos. Just ask Cohen. M'kay https://t.co/9qHl8YpNzN
@MSNBC SO, not a warzone, it's safe to go to. But if it's a warzone, he has to stay out because of bone spurs. Sorry @potus @realDonaldTrump and @VP but this is just a photo op. You don't honor King because you believe in his cause, but merely as an afterthought of appeasement. https://t.co/QYtxVlD0Yk
@GOP @VP The offer was already known. @realDonaldTrump has no intention to #OpenTheGovernment. He's a conman. He offered something that not only would @TheDemocrats reject, but so wuld many of the freedom party. Temporary relief for a permanent #wall was never was never a genuine offer. https://t.co/RbRJkqAHoW
@RedState No, she's voting against a Wall that's not going to do anything that is claimed to do. Nor is the cost what has been stated to be. Why give agree to temporary status for a monument to insecurity, racism, an egotistical megalomaniac? #OpenTheDamnGovernmentMITCH
@GOP The one person that can end this #TrumpMcConnellPenceGOPShutdown is @senatemajldr by bringing it to a vote. It's sad that the @GOP lost its way since Reagan. The reality, is that he would be considered a #RHINO at this point. It's the party of hatred and the devil himself.
@GOP Americans face eviction and starvation due to the #TrumpMitchShutDown. They are crying as they don't have the ability to care for their children. They are more fearful about getting sick. They are wondering how their own government can do this to them. #OpenTheDamnGovernmentMITCH
We have to remind one another that this is a journey that affects us all. There should be no reason to hate another based on their race, religion, age or sex.
We cannot let the hatred that has popped up to continue. By doing so, it will tear our nation a part. It will take away what should be a country that is welcoming to one and all. A country that takes care of its own. We must turn back from this path that we're on and unit.
#MartinLutherKingJrDay Dr. King is an admirable man. He talked of uniting the people of our country. He talked of freedom. He talked the importance of communicating with one another. Of his dreams. Our country has become blind and no longer is working to that goal. It needs too.
@Heritage Obama reduced the number of centrifuges allowed that W. Bush had negotiated. They also agreed to allow inspectors into any of their nuclear sites. They can make fuel but not weapons. He reduced their uranium load by 98%. #Trump however, wants to cancel this. he's not a genius. https://t.co/r1RpT7zLB1
@PressSec I don't believe you. Not one bit. The #Devil has taken control of our country, and you sit there at his side. Taking glee in this shutdown as you're not affected by it. I seriously believe that you don't have any mirrors in your house so you don't have to look at yourself.
@seanhannity @TheDemocrats If the @GOP congressional members wanted too, they could have forced his funding for the #Wall through at anytime during the last two years. @senatemajldr is the one person that could have funded it by going nuclear and requiring only 51 instead of the 60 votes needed. Blame him.
@seanhannity Quit calling it a compromise. It's a bone meant to be rejected by @TheDemocrats so he can point fingers saying they won't work with him to give him the damn #Wall. #DACA is protected, and a three year extension is meaningless for a permanent wall. #TrumpMcConnellPenceGOPShutdown
@senatemajldr There are literally MILLIONS of people that are being affected by the #TrumpMcConnellPenceGOPShutdown and yo don't care that they are dying. Allowing it to continue shows that you're not a christian and you have no soul. Instead you're #Satan's earthly carnation.
@senatemajldr You're the last person that should be calling for people to unit. You can't even compromise to let any spending bill be voted on. Instead, you to pass a bill to protect #Israel. TWO bills on the Middle East. That's all! Sitting on no less than 7 H.R.s #OpenTheDamnGovernmentMITCH
@ThisWeekABC @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @TheDemocrats He’s doing this to try to bully and shame them into giving into him. Since he cannot give them a contact to break and welch and stiff them on. This is part of what his, “art of the deal” entails. Pressure tactics. Not tacos like autocorrect suggested. I do like 🌮 very much. https://t.co/vVe1Rssbac
@ThisWeekABC @realDonaldTrump offer was never meant to be a serious offer. It’s meant to be a bone thrown to his base to rile them up by claiming that @SpeakerPelosi and the @TheDemocrats we’re blocking his agenda. That they don’t care about border security because of not funding the wall.
@realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow Dude, are you fucking high? You're tweeting more than a teenager that has gotten their first smartphone. Crushing up your #adderall or something else? Tell us, do you also have the munchies? Because if you do, you've been hitting Mary pretty hard. That could make Melania jealous. https://t.co/oXyyRFzd5m
@nytimes @TheDemocrats That's suppose to be #DACA...He actually is also trying to kill the #ACA.. but that's another issue.
@nytimes If it were snubbed all around, then don't point fingers just at @TheDemocrats. There was nothing new in his proposal. #ACA extension for three years with no path to citizenship? Why? When the #Wall is permanent, so should they. He's afraid to lose face is what is comes down to. https://t.co/RrJ31i0hTP
@realDonaldTrump These "patriots" are suffering because of you, but mostly because #MitchMcConnellShutdown isn't allowing anything to come to a vote. If he allowed a vote, then you could veto it and send it back to be overridden. No #Wall ever. They don't want a wall, they want to be paid. https://t.co/q3goQ3buMD
@MelGrimes6 @senrobportman @POTUS Reagan gave amnesty to illegals with no demand for a #Wall. He's admired by many conservatives as the greatest there ever was. Trump turned down an offer that gave him what he wanted last June. All 25 billion with #DACA. Again, he TURNED down what he asked. #smh No wall, ever
@CATGUTLEACH295 @Bu11M89 @BillOReilly No, he lost the popular vote. The electoral college elected him. Had it been based on the popular vote, *shudders* than Hillary would be president. I don't care for either of the two, but the man has no concept on, The Art of the Deal. He didn't write or contribute to it.
@SenJohnHoeven Just say, #OpenTheDamnGovernmentMITCH. Millions of people are suffering due to his being an ass and not allowing a vote of the House bills.
@SenJohnHoeven John, #Trump had already tried to end #DACA, but courts have ruled against him and #SCOTUS declined to touch it. He knows that he's been offered money for border security, without the #Wall. It's his ego that is keeping him from doing that. Also, #WhereIsMitch? https://t.co/O7xIuuIIRJ
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Like an even bigger deficit due to a tax break on the 1%. The fewest number of bills passed, 96, than any other president at this time of their term? Having the most number of staff leave, AND most convicted and imprisoned? Well congratuFUCKINGlations on that. https://t.co/NxNO4OHmXJ
@realDonaldTrump I really don't care, do u? https://t.co/Bp9bGmLbNL
@realDonaldTrump What trade deals? There are none that have been approved by congress yet and none anytime SOON™. The unemployment is a continuance from when #Obama was in office. Millions being affected by the #TrumpMcConnellPenceGOPShutdown. That's not a win. Low level jobs aren't either.
@GOP @senatemajldr @HouseDemocrats Damn #RussianBot. Three years with no path to citizenship for a permanent wall? Stupid, just plain stupid.
@GOP @senatemajldr There was no bold plan to reopen the govt. The offer is DoA in the Senate. In fact, I #TripleDogDare @senatemajldr to bring ANY #gop bill to fund the #Wall to a vote. If he does, then it just goes to show that he can bring any of the @HouseDemocrats bills to a vote too. https://t.co/ohaFshZS8y
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @GOP @senatemajldr #MitchOpenTheDamnGovt could do so at any time by allowing a vote, yet he simply refuses to. He's turtling to avoid having to deal with #Trump. https://t.co/ZYyxKVZbpC
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Huckster, the @GOP had two years controlling bout houses of congress. @senatemajldr had no issues going nuclear to shove a taxcut for the 1% that has increased the deficit and it will continue to do so. #Trump offered nothing new. No path to citizenship for a permanent #Wall. 1/2
@GOP @realDonaldTrump I'm having a hard time getting this account to translate properly from #Russian. These #Russianbot accounts sure don't want you to know what they're saying. https://t.co/C48lUhM7OZ
@realDonaldTrump Progress? What progress? They've stepped up their research and they are expanding their test sites. They haven't stopped. You also gave into them by canceling war games. They'll do the same thing that they have done in years past. Stall and agree to more "talks". #smh
@realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr And your building when money is not available, is just you scurrying to #Russia for more money and then stiffing you r contractors.
@realDonaldTrump Did you ever stop to think that @senatemajldr is quietly sabotaging you? He never listened to you. Never. You said for him to go nuclear and push through your spending bills, but he didn't. Why? Because he doesn't like you and he's trying to show you can't control him. #sad https://t.co/ICqNElQZrL
@realDonaldTrump If no amnesty, and no path to citizenship, there is no reason to make a deal. Why a temporary reprieve for A #WALL that is permanent? That makes no sense. The many are here while awaiting for paperwork to be completed, are also considered illegal. So no, be careful Trump! https://t.co/6t6VOvt2Nk

@RepKevinBrady @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Kevin, the offer to provide only three years for #DACA in exchange for a permanent #Wall is unacceptable. If you were so worried about federal workers, then why didn’t you and @senatemajldr go nuclear while holding both houses? This is a #TrumpMcConnellPenceGOPShutdown. #NoWall
@frfrankpavone @realDonaldTrump How sad that you turn people away. Hebrews 13:2 Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.
@SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump @POTUS You had two whole years controlling both chambers of congress. At anytime during those two years, either member could have gone nuclear and pushed through the funding for the wall. It never happened because the reality is that neither Ryan or Mitch like #Trump. So deal with it. https://t.co/7J3MYwHKYx
@GOP @realDonaldTrump The man is beyond a deranged idiot. He believes that San Antonio, Tx is on the border and that the wall built there is working. 🤯 San Antonio for one, does not have a wall, and two, is 150 miles north of the border, so it doesn't need a wall. https://t.co/LQpkLiVY23
@SenatorLankford James, #Trump already has some 2 billion in unspent funding for the border. There's no reason to provide more funding if there are funds readily available. He has not offered a path to citizenship for #DACA, only a three year extension. No #Wall period.
@SenateGOP @SenJohnBarrasso #Trump already has some 2 billion in unspent funding for the border. There's no reason to provide more funding if there are funds readily available. He has not offered a path to citizenship for #DACA, only a three year extension. No #Wall period. #OpenTheGovernmentMitch
@GOPLeader #Trump already has some 2 billion in unspent funding for the border. There's no reason to provide more funding if there are funds readily available. He has not offered a path to citizenship for #DACA, only a three year extension. No #Wall period. #SCOTUS will not rule on #DACA
@RepRWilliams @SpeakerPelosi #Trump already has some 2 billion in unspent funding for the border. There's no reason to provide more funding if there are funds readily available. He has not offered a path to citizenship for #DACA, only a three year extension. No #Wall period. #SCOTUS will not rule on #DACA
@SenJoniErnst @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump Joni, #Trump is sitting on some 2 billion in unspent funds for border security. There is no reason to provide additional when he's doing nothing with those funds. He is not offering a path to citizenship and the courts have ruled #DACA cannot be stopped. #SCOTUS will not touch it
@SenAlexander The border wall as he proposes does nothing to stop drugs or illegal immigration. A three year extension is not a path to citizenship. No other president was for a border spanning the southern US border. No Wall Ever*!! (*Trump speak)
@SenAlexander Lamar, he offered nothing. #DACA is not negotiable. Courts have ruled it cannot be canceled and #SCOTUS won't hear it. The mad king wants an entire border. It won't happen. The next president can easily cancel it. It's a monument to him and him alone. 1/2
@sendavidperdue @POTUS As with all other @GOP senators, I'm saying this. @senatemajldr had two years to push through any funding for the #Wall that he wanted. He could have gone nuclear, and sent the bill to the #GOP house to pass. Again, he did not need 60 votes as he could have gone nuclear. #smh
@SenJohnBarrasso @realDonaldTrump Unless you're one of the cowards of the senate, force @senatemajldr to vote on a bill passed by the house and open the damn government.
@SenJohnBarrasso @realDonaldTrump No John, he didn't. The offer includes #DACA, which the courts ruled he cannot cancel. It does not offer citizenship, or protections for the "three year" extension. It's not new and does nothing. He has almost 2 billion he has yet to touch. No #Wall funding. Period.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump You're telling us, that in the two years that the #GOP held office, that you were unable to push through a bill funding the #Wall? That @senatemajldr was powerless and couldn't force a vote? You know, like he blocked #Obama's #SCOTUS pick, and forced through #Trump's? No, wow. https://t.co/XTJtOVoRLL
@SenThomTillis #DACA cannot be canceled and including it is a farce. #trump's proposal is nothing new. He has been offering the same thing repeatedly and he has been told, No. This is still a #TrumpMcConnellPenceGOPShutdown. @senatemajldr needs to allow voting on the House bills
@marcorubio The bill is DOA. It does not offer a path to citizenship. An extension does not guaranty that that person will be able to stay at the end of the three years. Trump is sitting on border security funding that he has not touched, unlike his daughter Ivanka. https://t.co/Mb4s4DatDn
@seanhannity What comprise? He didn’t offer a path to citizenship. He can’t stop #DACA. His offer for a three year extension is garbage. There is nothing that he offered that a reasonable person would find acceptable. Not one. https://t.co/PdmjR3ndD3
@realDonaldTrump @newtgingrich I doubt that Newt would make mention of Lincoln. But these stories, you tell them with such enthusiasm. https://t.co/A3ILOA92uF
@marcorubio @POTUS You are not a Christian. Your bible quotes are meaningless and fool no one. Rubio, the offer of a three years extension without a path to citizenship is not acceptable. No wall, period.
@senrobportman @POTUS This is not a constructive new proposal. This is the same thing that has been offered and rejected. Three years and NO PATH to citizenship is unacceptable. All this is is lipstick on a pig. No money for a wall, period. https://t.co/z27ow0uZmw
@seanhannity And yet #Flotus is allowed to travel freely. This is just a big baby lashing out as he has been told that he cannot do the #SOTU2019 from the House floor. https://t.co/twrn3MNPMk
@NRO He has an Oval Office. If he wants to deliver one, then he can do so from there. https://t.co/Qu9PRHJHTe
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS No, you didn’t stop them. They arrived at a legal point of entry and are awaiting proper processing to enter the US. There’s a difference. https://t.co/SlhAQl8uWD
@SpeakerPelosi, instead of stopping the #SOTU2019, allow it to take place, but have no cameras. Allow audio only and limit it to 15-20 minutes. If that long seeing as he has #ADD. Much like the fireside chats of #FDR? This way, he gets his speech but no real audience.

@SenGillibrand @senatemajldr Kirsten, let’s not forget about the families and businesses as well. That would probably be close to two million people if not more, being affected by this shutdown.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump #Russianbot continues to spread propaganda. There are bills that have passed the House that #MitchObstruction refuses to bring to a vote. #Trump has already stated that he will not negotiate. He will only sign a bill that fully funds the wall. He’s sitting on $1.6 billion already

@realDonaldTrump There 800k employees, plus their families, businesses they would be spending money at going without getting paid. At least 2 million people being affected by #TrumpShutown #MitchTrumPutinShutdown that could lose everything they have and you simply don’t care. https://t.co/UvcF39O9Jc
@GOP @VP Oh #Russianbot account. There are numerous bills sent to the senate and one passed by them that was sent to the house that would’ve opened the govt, but never voted on. This is #MitchTrumPutinShutdown
@JohnCornyn @FreeBeacon ..we only talk about 800k employees. Not the family members, or businesses that they also support. I’d be willing to bet that this shutdown affects some 2 million people. Restaurants, grocery stores, gas stations, banks, etc etc. Mitch is being forced by someone. Remove him now.
@JohnCornyn @FreeBeacon Please stop Tweeting articles from the Beacon. It’s a neoconservative website thats publishing lies. Instead, forget them, forget the #Wall and remove the #MitchMcConnellTraitor from leadership. Open the govt and get people back to work. When we talk about the shutdown 1/2

@realDonaldTrump Think about and focus on this. You're 72 years old. You constantly eat fast food. You're closer to death than the #Wall is to being finished even it it was started today. It'll take an estimated two decades to complete. Meaning you'll probably never see it completed.

@GovAbbott You and the rest of the #TexasGOP have let the schools rot and have taken money from the for decades. Texas has fallen in education. You’re planning to limit property taxes which will lead to even more losses in education funding.
@NBCNews I’m getting tired of this shit from @realDonaldTrump, but I will not backdown. I will not stop pushing to reopen the govt, without funding for the #Wall. #Trump is out of top with reality. He doesn’t care people are starving. He’s a #Russianasset and is doing their bidding
@SenGillibrand My apologies, Kirsten.
@SenGillibrand Then Kristen, fight Mitch and reopen the govt. We have 800k+ that need to work and get paid to live. This isn’t happening with the shutdown. Push Mitch to either bring a vote to open the govt, or remove him from office.
@SenatorLankford Faith, James, is meaningless when the #Devil is running the country. You talk about faith, but do nothing to force Mitch to bring a vote to reopen the govt or remove him as the leader. Faith may feed the soul, but it cannot feed, clothe or house a family. https://t.co/CRDIsXzqoJ

@senrobportman This #wall will not get built. It will take years of filing eminent domain cases and years to go through the court system. It will take decades to even be built if it’s not killed by the next president. It’s a waste and 800k+ lives are being destroyed. The cost overruns 1/2

@SenatorRomney to come across as a level headed evangelical, start the revolution in the senate and force @senatemajldr to bring bills passed by the house to a vote, or his removal as speaker of the senate. It is the duty of all members of congress to work for their constituents
@politico It's no longer #Trump that we should worry about. It's @senatemajldr who's a #RussianAsset by keeping the senate from voting on the bills passed by the House. He's a coward and is afraid of Trump.
@NRO @senatemajldr is a #RussianAsset and has been compromised. He needs to be removed from his leadership position and the senate. He's a coward and fears #Trump.
@senatemajldr it is your duty to the Senate and to the American people to bring to a vote, the bills passed and presented by the House. If you cannot perform the duties of your office, the RESIGN from congress. You're worse than Benedict Arnold. #RussianAsset
@RoyBlunt I don’t watch Russian propaganda. The wall is nothing more than smoke and mirrors. #Trump doesn’t give a damn about border security. He has almost $2 billion in unspent finds already. He’s just trying to see how much blood he can squeeze from America.
@RepSamGraves @HouseGOP It’s estimated that it’ll take up to two decades to build the wall. The majority of the older members of Congress will be dead and buried before it’ll be completed. Remember this. The wall can be canceled by a future president. And it will. Open the govt and kill the wall.
@senatemajldr #boycottIsrael we have no reason to be voting for anything unless it’s to open the govt. We have to reason to fund them either. Quit this crap and vote to to open the govt and pay everyone that has been held hostage because you’re to aftof #Trump https://t.co/NvoRXRksEg

@senatemajldr The expansion was at border towns and to replace existing walls. He did not hold the country hostage. You have held the country hostage by not allowing any votes to reopen the government. #MitchMcConnellShutdown
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Sounds like something that #Hitler said. Yes I went there. Russia has gotten to this account and has a stockpile of goods on @POTUS. He’s been compromised and needs to be removed from office.
@realDonaldTrump You weren’t elected by me. You lost the popular vote. You’re just a bully and have no concept of reality. The wall is waste of money and can take over two decades to complete. Which it won’t as the next president most likely will cancel it. https://t.co/Z5KYZbb6eX

@richbflo @PhineasB4 @seanhannity They paid for all of their own expenses. This was not paid for by the taxpayers.
@seanhannity No, they paid their own expenses. They also were there to raise money for #PuertoRico. So $15 million. That’s because @realDonaldTrump cut funding for recovery from the hurricanes. Plus, @senatemajldr stayed that there would be no votes over the weekend.
@seanhannity @GreggJarrett Russia loves you. How much do you receive from them?
What’s mind boggling is had any of these meetings taken place between #Obama and #Putin and he took and desothe notes, they’d of started impeachment proceedings almost immediately. But you put an R by the name, and it’s ok or they just ignore it like its normal. #MitchObstruction
@GOP @realDonaldTrump #WhereIsMitch Those Dems país there own expenses and raised $15 million dollars to replace the funds that @realDonaldTrump cutoff. Plus, Mitch and the other GOP members weee also not in town. And no, he has not been in town the whole time or at the #WH the whole time.
@realDonaldTrump No they aren’t. You personally walked away from $25 billion in border funding in exchange for #DACA. There’s no reason at this point to include it on current talks as courts state it can’t be stopped.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump They spent their own funds in #PuertoRico raising $15 million due to the fact that @POTUS cutoff funds to them for hurricane recovery. Plus, @senatemajldr has been #MIA and needs to be found and forced to hold a vote on the bills asses by the House. Romney McDaniel
@marcorubio @POTUS The current @POTUS position on #TrumpsShutdown #MitchMcConnellShutdown is that there is no compromise on a multi billion $ waste of money. It’s not about border security. It’s about him trying to win and have a monument to himself. Nothing more. His ego won’t let him backdown.
@LouDobbs @POTUS I mean if there were tens of thousands, the news would cover this nonstop.
@LouDobbs @POTUS Wait, wait, just wait. There have been tens of thousands of Americans killed by illegal aliens?? That’s news to me. I have yet to see this on the news. Do you have a source for all of these deaths, or are you still seeing fluffy little clouds in the sky and off your medication?
@ThisWeekABC @senatemajldr The #GOP had two full years to pass this legislation by whatever means that they wanted too. If the #MitchShutdown is to end, then he needs to be either forced to bring the House CR to a vote, removed, or stop aside and let someone else hold the Majority Leadership.
@ThisWeekABC Because you can't counter offer stupid. This has long since been about border security. Had it been about border security, @senatemajldr would have made it a priority and nuked the senate. There was no urgent call until the House flipped. It's a con job like his contracts.
@realDonaldTrump The same rag that has more stories about you that would embarrass most people and that can bring down you presidency? The man has more money than you will ever have and will still have more money than you will ever have even after his divorce.
@realDonaldTrump Are we talking about the National Enquirer? The same entertainment, loosely, rag mag that paid to silence at least two different women that you slept with and paid off? Both probably while your wife was pregnant and that has turned state's witness in admitting to it?

@SenBillCassidy @BarackObama Also allowing him to bypass congress gives the president more power over congress. That power would come closer to a king, or dictator.

@SenBillCassidy What if @BarackObama had done the same thing in the name of gun control? Or healthcare? Would you allow him to do so? If #Trymp tries this and courts says he can do so, then expect future presidents to do the same thing. All you can do at that time is nothing. 1/2

@GOP @SenTedCruz Scruffy, if the wall was so important to the @GOP, then why didn't @senatemajldr launch the nukes? He's more afraid to give #Trump what he wants than to keep the govt open. He had two years to push for the wall. And why a shutdown now? Because Dems have the house now... 1/2
@LouDobbs @POTUS Each jurisdiction has rules for eminent. I can assure you, that every single person whose land is targeted, will fight it. Then there is the contractors that bid for it. They'll lose business too. The cost of roads, water, waste removal, housing and more have not been calculated.
@LouDobbs @POTUS Is this account still being maintained by Lou, or is it now being run by the #Russians? The reality of a wall being built in the next 5 years is zero. Even with funding, there will need to be multiple eminent domain filings and court battles against them. 1/2

@CNN @SenRonJohnson If you're aware that it'll go to court and not get built, then why is the issue being pushed? @realDonaldTrump is on a powertrip. He knows that his days as president are limited and he is demanding a wall solely as a monument to himself. It's not about the border, but ego.

@ThisWeekABC @GStephanopoulos @SenatorDurbin The bigger issue is that it’ll open a Pandora’s box when it comes to so called “national emergencies.” What happens down the line if one goes after guns, climate or healthcare. What about one taking on a Hitler movement by locking up certain racist? 1/2

@realDonaldTrump Is the same as you have a #TopSecret plan on how to defeat #ISIS? Keep to yourself in your head so that they don't know what you're planning? Just rocking back and forth saying that you're a good boy. Trump is a good boy. Attempting to pat yourself on the back? https://t.co/45hTGehd5K
Hey @JohnCornyn @SenTedCruz @SpeakerPelosi #WhereisMitch? @senatemajldr seems to be missing. He doesn't appear to be in #DC trying to get the govt open again! That's really #sad. He seemed to enjoy blocking @Obama. @Potus @realDonaldTrump do you know where Mitch is?
#WhereisMitch? Has anyone seen @senatemajldr recently? Maybe someone should call the police and have them do a welfare check on him? He had been so very vocal and concerned when it came to #Obama and his bills. He even gleefully blocked his #SCOTUS. Maybe it's the #Mitchshutdown?
@CBSNews Sad thing about it is, that people would rather donate to project that had no chance of ever being achieved, instead of donating to organizations that help veterans, or agencies that help the poor. He would of kept it himself, but he couldn't because of how the fund was set up.
RT @SenCortezMasto: In the last two fiscal years, Congress has given the President billions in taxpayer money for new fencing at the border…
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump But where in the world is @senatemajldr who refuses to call a vote on any legislation that he's afraid to send to #Trump that will hurt his feelings? There's a number of bills that can be approved, but this #MitchShutdown won't end until he brings it to a vote, or he's removed.

@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump Liu, nice work with all of the buzzwords. Yes, @senatemajldr is totally incompetent as he should’ve gone nuclear and pushed #Trump’s bills through, but he doesn’t like him and that’s why he didn’t do it. 🤣🤣🤣

@LouDobbs @MrsT106 @POTUS @David_Bossie Naw. I personally have hated #Trump the first time I saw him on tv. Our current president is a damn idiot. He’s a failure. He’s bankrupted a casino. A CASINO. He did that by raiding its equity and let it fail. That way he wrote it off in taxes.
@marcorubio And another: “Long ago I gave these commands to my people: ‘You must see that justice is done, and must show kindness and mercy to one another. Do not oppress widows, orphans, foreigners who live among you, or anyone else in need.”	(Zechariah 7:9)
@marcorubio And this: He makes sure that orphans and widows are treated fairly; he loves the foreigners who live with our people, and gives them food and clothes. So then, show love for those foreigners, because you were once foreigners in Egypt.	(Deuteronomy 10:18-19)
@marcorubio You're like bible verse, read this: Do not mistreat foreigners who are living in your land. Treat them as you would an Israelite, and love them as you love yourselves. Remember that you were once foreigners in the land of Egypt. I am the Lord your God. (Leviticus 19:33-34)
@realDonaldTrump If this was a tv, I'd have turned the channel in the first two minutes of the show coming on! https://t.co/rk5mc4FuFX
@realDonaldTrump No, you don't have a plan. That load in your #Depends is a pile of shit. If you had a plan, you'd lay it out to all Americans. The reality is you lost the popular vote. Yes the EC elected you, but you still lost. And that wall was to be paid for by Mexico. https://t.co/U1cSNbCzEs
@SpeakerPelosi, it's time to censor Rep. King and remove him from all committees. There is no reason to have him on any committees with him showing he's a racist.
@GOP #Trump was at the border and there was no crisis shown while he was there. In @realDonaldTrump logic, there should have been hordes of vehicles streaming across the border full of illegals, drugs, and women being smuggled taped up in back of cars.
@GOP @SenTedCruz @senatemajldr Also Ted, the House, Senate and #WH were all held by the @GOP. If it was such an urgent matter, then the #MitchShutdown wouldn't be happening as he could have nuked the senate. https://t.co/Xbsaasp5UL
@GOP @SenTedCruz No idea #wtf cruz is looking like he does...Needs to stand closer to the razor next time. But this #TrumpShutdown was claimed before it happened. Schumer was told that. If @senatemajldr would quit being a coward and bring the bills to a vote, red employees could get paid. No wall
@senrobportman Rob, the biggest issue right now is that @senatemajldr is refusing to bring any bill to a vote on the senate floor that would reopen the govt. Yes #Trump will veto any bill not containing funding for a #Wall, but the House passed bills should be voted on in the #Senate.
@realDonaldTrump You can open the government much easier by saying that it's opened instead of having to wait, "15 minutes." Just say, "I'm opening the government while we work this out." https://t.co/ZvDNZJiEPU
@realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr Plus, you also need the republicans to go back too. The dems already passed a number of bills, it's just that the Mitch is to coward to call everyone back and allow a vote.
@realDonaldTrump Not even @senatemajldr likes you. Understand this, that at anytime during the last session of congress, you could have had ANYTHING you wanted, had they gone nuclear. They didn't because they don't like you. They don't. No go cry your little eyes out.
@realDonaldTrump Unlike your failed businesses and yesmen, members of congress do not react to your #sad calls for attention. You sound like someone who's so desperate for a friend to come over, that you'll call everyone and are upset that no one is answering the phone. Hint, they're ignoring you
@realDonaldTrump Just what exactly are you afraid of? The fact that once you're voted out of office that you'll never be able to have the power that you have now? And that power should be limited, except that the last congress was also so power hungry, they never reeled you in.

Medicare for all and climate control
@LouDobbs @EdRollins @POTUS The @GoP had two years of controlling both houses. Do you want to know why there’s no funds for the #Wall?

@HouseGOP The crisis of family separation began with Sessions and @realDonaldTrump. The wall is just something to stroke #Trump’s ego with as he can call it a monument to himself. He doesn’t care if it stops anything or not.
@GOP We’ve had the same open borders for decades. The crime rate and drugs coming through haven’t really changed that much for decades as well. This is indeed a manufactured crisis. And it was put into #Trump’s by the racist that he surrounds himself with. #smh
@GOP @ChuckGrassley Hey, shutting down the federal government for the longest time is an accomplishment, but not one that you should be proud of. That is unless you’re. #Russianbot and are proud on dividing the US.
@henryrodgersdc @DailyCaller Not reading anything from that site. Bottom line is this. If #Trump tries to use a national emergency excuse to get the wall, a Dem could take office and do the same for gun control. For climate control and healthcare. It would set a bad precedent and abuse of office.
@JohnCornyn John, the @GOP had both houses for two years. @senatemajldr could have rammed through a #trumpedUpbordercrisis bills had wanted too. He didn’t. This is just much #Mitchshutdown as it is yours. Forget the D and R. Do what’s right for federal employees and America and open it up.
@SenTedCruz @CBP This shutdown can be solved by forcing @senatemajldr to bring the House bills to a vote. It is not the Dems. They have passed bills in the house to reopen the government. The wall is a sham and doesn’t need to be built. #Trump only wants it to show his a winner. He’s not.
@realDonaldTrump You have already have a gun pointed at the head of federal employees and are ignoring their pleas to reopen the government so they can get paid. Call a damn national emergency so when the Dems take the #WH, they can do the same for anything that they want. #TrumpShutown
@realDonaldTrump This is not about stopping people and drugs coming into this country. This is about you being #butthurt and not winning. That’s it. Your so obsessedwith trying to come out on top, that you don’t care who you fuck over to do it. #smh

@BillOReilly They're owned by Fox Entertainment Group. It's not a news channel. In fact, Roger Ailes stated it was an entertainment channel. That's how the channel has been able to get away with many unchecked factoids that it spews, mostly, it's chunks. Also, you don't work for them anymore
@realDonaldTrump Not only that, but #Mexico and #Canada haven't approved the #USMCA yet either. Without them also approving it, it's going NOWHERE. #sad #smh
@realDonaldTrump You have NOT signed a new trade deal. Even if you had, it STILL will need to be approved by Congress. And I can tell you that the house will not sign it. Plus, with the #MitchShutdown, it's not going to get a vote. #IdiotInChief
@senatemajldr won't allow a vote to reopen congress. He's afraid that if he does allow a floor vote, that it'll be vetoed, and if he allows an override vote, it'll pass. So he's just doing nothing at all. #MitchShutdown #TrumpShutdown #ResignNowTrump #TrumpResignNow https://t.co/tw8dycI94x

@realDonaldTrump If we lose 300 Americans per week through the Southern Border, maybe they're just going for a visit and coming back on a jet plane or on a boat? If they're not coming back through the board, then we could easily lose track of them.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS @JohnCornyn No one that lives along the border wants the wall. There is not one property owner along the border that wants, or is willing to allow their property to be divided by the damn wall.
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @FoxNews Sean is a hack and slumlord. His nose gets browner the closer he gets to you.
@LouDobbs @RepAndyBiggsAZ A wall of this type would take decades to secure the land, tons of resources to build and most of the old farts would be dead even before it's 1/4 of the way built. You ever ask why didn't Mitch or Ryan go nuclear to get the funding for the wall? Because it doesn't do anything.
@GOP @GOPChairwoman #Russianbot why do you keep sowing discontent and divide the country? The wall has nothing to do about safeguarding the country. It's about a monument to stupidity. The #GOP had control of both houses and the #WH. If your team wanted it, they'd of funded it. They didn't do either
@GOP @realDonaldTrump You're right, it's not about politics, it's about ego. A big fat one that has been a loser all his life and has had to file multiple bankruptcies. #TrumpShutdown2019 #McConnellObstruction #MitchMcConnellShutdown  #GOPShutdown
@HawleyMO @JohnCornyn Israel can fall for all I care. We have no business funding them. That money is better used in the States.
@CBSNews @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Not only that, but even the senate GOP want behind the trade deal either.
@CBSNews There is no trade deal. It’s #DOA once it hits the House. It takes both houses to approve a trade deal and you’re not getting it. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump. And you’re not getting a damn #Wall.
@ThisWeekABC @senatemajldr is a coward. That’s clearer than the lies that @realDonaldTrump keeps repeating. If he wanted to find the #Wall, he could have done so at anytime by going nuclear.
@JohnCornyn @politico This is squarely on @senatemajldr and you along with the rest of the @GOP who did nothing but crawl over and your backs because the president has an R by his name. This is just as much your fault as it is #trump and #Ryan
@senatemajldr What’s immoral is the fact that you can call for a vote at anytime but you won’t. You’re so afraid of #Trump, that you’d rather cower under your desk than speak out against him. #Mitchshutdown
@realDonaldTrump That there’s no reason for a wall
@realDonaldTrump Do you know what a #FalseFlag is? Because we sure do and we’ll be watching to make sure you don’t try to pull one off. The towns along the border don’t want you there. They say that they’re pretty safe and that there’s reason for a wall.
@realDonaldTrump In other words, you stood up, looked at them, started tearing up and were so distraught, that you said bye, and ran out of the room crying hysterically. Remember people, you have to read between the lies when it comes to #Trump/
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump 2/2 He's trying to run the country like it's his own business and that he can use the same tactics. Real life and government don't work that way. He's also had multiple bankruptcies and only has what little money he does because of an inheritance. He's a #Failure.
@PressSec 1/2 Sarah, you're just fear mongering. While MS-13 is a threat, that's not what this #Wall is about. It's all about ego. @realDonaldTrump has a fantasy that he's the best deal maker that there is. #Pointblank, he's not. He's never been one. period.
@ABC @VP, a really president, or negotiator would come back with a counter offer or ask what would it take to happen. This man has no clue what the art of the deal is. He's screwed thousands of people with his contracts and is just being a baby at this point. https://t.co/E5dm3KyCFk
@rep_stevewomack @POTUS @HouseGOP If you wanted border funding, then why didn't @senatemajldr push through the bills when the #GOP had both houses? He had no issues blocking and shoving a #SCOTUS pick through. A wall will not work. It's a phallic symbol for @POTUS, that's all it is.
@DailyCaller And the @GOP closed, moved many polling places without telling the voters. They also sent out tweets stating polls moved, when they didn't. Let's also talk about how gerrymandered numerous states are.
@NBCNews @TheDemocrats made an offer last year for #DACA with a pathway towards citizenship for $25 billion, which @realDonaldTrump originally agreed to, but then an hour or so later, decided to #WalkAway. There's no reason for Dems to revive that offer. Too little too late.
@ABC If @senatemajldr was behind @POTUS @realDonaldTrump then he would have his wall funding. The @Gop had both houses and the #WH. This #MitchShutdown would never have happened if he went nuclear and shoved the bills through. #sad
@GregAbbott_TX And yet, Texas has the highest maternal death rate in the developed world. https://t.co/m346Dcu5b3 Tell us, how you want to cut funding to Planned Parenthood?
@DailyCaller It was 70% when Kennedy was in office. It wasn't until the @GOP took office that the rate was slashed. Reagan slashed it and the deficit spiked due to the loss of tax income for the US Govt.
@GOP @kayleighmcenany #Russianbot answer this, what happened to @senatemajldr going nuclear on the GOP bills and pushing them through like he did for Kavanaugh for the #SCOTUS? The real reason is that Mitch is so afraid of #Trump and what he'll do, that he #cockblocked the #Wall.
@esaagar @DailyCaller #Trump was offered $25 billion in exchange for #DACA and a path to citizenship. He had agreed and then someone whispered in his ear and he declined it. This is on Trump and @senatemajldr   Especially on #MitchShutdown as he refuses to bring any bill to reopen the fed to a vote.
@KamVTV @realDonaldTrump Naw, this is like a boss. https://t.co/mwBYK5BbzX
@realDonaldTrump Oh ho, so that’s the art of the deal. Don’t get what you want, then walk out like you’re the top dog and make them come after you begging for your forgiveness and their apologies. Guess what? That’s not how Congress works. It’s time for a reality check, idiot. https://t.co/2NSdrYYM5a
@SenJohnBarrasso @SenateGOP @GOP @senatemajldr No one can work together if Mitch refuses to act.
@SenJohnBarrasso @SenateGOP John, the @GOP had both houses and could have passed legislation during those two years. @senatemajldr went nuclear on numerous bills and blocked Obama’s #SCOTUS pick. This is #MitchShutdown at this point. A bill passed the house but Mitch refuses to bring it for a senate vote.
@sendavidperdue @POTUS Bullshit. If this was so important, then why didn’t @senatemajldr go nuclear to get the funds over the last two years when the @GOP had both houses? Because he doesn’t want to fund it.
@GOP @GOPLeader No, this is about a man that’s so desperate to have a monument built for him, that he gets a limp stiffy thinking of how he can screw America and stick them with a bill for something it doesn’t need. #WhereAreThePesos
@DailyCaller Is this the one of her feet? If so, a foot fetish site has already proven it’s fake. https://t.co/IBJXrD0NwA
@RepRatcliffe @realDonaldTrump The real reason that the govt is shutdown is that @senatemajldr is not bringing any of the House bills to a vote. #Trump has him by the balls and the #MitchShutdown won’t be resolved while he holds the speaker of the senate. That’s why it’s currently shutdown.
@seanhannity I don’t read your crap, but Sean. We know that you’re just trying to support #Trump as he’s a cash cow for you. You try to come across like a semi intelligent person, so you should know that a wall does none of the things he claims it’ll do. So #sad. https://t.co/CWgNvJcSAZ
@BillOReilly Hey Bill, when was the last time you had a MRI? May want to have one soon, because #Trump doesn’t need any help embarrassing himself. He admitted that if he doesn’t get the wall, that he just may have to declare a Nat Emergency. Why? What’s #Russia have on you?
@GOP @realDonaldTrump I like free 🥓. But as far as beacon goes, it’s just another propaganda outlet setup to puck #Trump’s conspiracy theories. If it’s so important, then why didn’t you do anything to push if through in the last two years like @senatemajldr did other items he hawked? #wrong
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Stop posting Russian propaganda and let an American have this account. The supposed crisis does not exist. People and congressional members who live and represent them don’t want the wall. They know none of the things being said by #Trump is true. #smh
@realDonaldTrump Forest. Also, forest fires happen because of nature. It’s a natural phenomenon that can die caused by lightning strikes and spontaneous combustion. The recent fires were urban. #smh

@JohnCornyn #MitchShutdown the senate as he has refused to allow any bills passed in the house to come to a vote in the senate that doesn't included funding for the wall as he's frightened of #Trump.

@JudgeCarter @POTUS Many people that live on the border do not want the wall. They say that they have other priorities to worry about and take care of. The wall is just #Trump not wanting to lose his base. Nothing more.  https://t.co/oCnp2nJDLm
@robertjeffress @realDonaldTrump He doesn't believe in "god". He believes in the almighty dollar. Takes his oath of office seriously, pfft. He takes it just as serious as he did that taco bowl he was sitting in front of for a picture, and then pitched it in the trash once the photo op was done.
@seanhannity If they have served their time and completed all their requirements of parole and probation, then they deserve to be able to vote again. Hence, former felons.
@LouDobbs Lou, had Mitch wanted to fund the wall, he could have gone nuclear at any point in time during the last two years, much like he screwed Obama out of a SCOTUS pick.
@LouDobbs This from a turtle that won't allow any bill to come to a vote in the senate unless he's sure that #Trump won't veto it. He won't allow or pass any bill that does not provide funding for #Trump's fantasy wall.
@JohnCornyn Why is this bill even being presented when there's a shutdown? The priority is reopening the government and getting the fed emps back to work. Provide back pay for all the contractors and emps that aren't eligible for it. Or face a surge in unemployment claims next job reports.
@HouseGOP Protecting our nation is one thing. Building a wall which isn't going to do anything he claims is another. There's no reason a wall should be built. It's just a phallic symbol to his failed manhood is all that it is. I have yet to meet a person face to face, that wants the walls.
@LouDobbs @GOPChairwoman Trump was offered and accepted a bill that provided $25 billion in exchange for keeping #DACA and allowing citizenship. Then he got a buzz in his ear and declined the offer.
@senatemajldr No. you have stated that you will not allow any bill to be voted in the senate unless it has funding for the wall because #babytrump will veto it. Both the senate and house can with enough members, override a veto. So his veto is a lame excuse.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump BS. There is more heroine shipped in shipping containers than comes across the border. There is also more heroine produced in the US than  across the border too, I bet. The reality, is the majority of drugs crossing the southern border is through legal ports of entry. #smh
@senatemajldr There should be no bills brought to the floor until after a CR is brought to the floor and the Fed is opened again. You are the one that is fully responsible for the #TrumpShutdown which is now called the #MitchShutdown. If you weren't so afraid of #Trump, people would be working
@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump Come on Lou. I'm sure you have the inside scoop on who's going to be fired this January. Tells us and we won't tell him you were the one that let it slip.
@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump I didn't watch the preview for the new #Trump, White House Apprentice Show. I take it that he exploded and fired someone during the preview, but we won't know until later on in the season. Will it be another General, or a Senior member of his staff? Just who will Trump fire next!
#Russia is getting what they want. #TrumpShutdowm and #BorderCrisis is causing the country to divide the nation. They want #Americans to turn against each other. People need to slow down and talk, not yell or shout at each other. #smh #sad
@SecNielsen @DHSgov Again a lie. They have encountered them at airports. Only six were encountered at the border.
@SecNielsen Bullshit. If it has, then that it means it went from six to twelve. Due you carry the same racist views as #Trump? The State Department and Border patrol have caught six and only six. #sad
Why are you allowing @potus to lie to Americans? Do not show his speech. @FoxNews @NBCNews @MSNBC @CBSNews @ABCPolitics @ABC @CNN @NewsHour @NBCNightlyNews By carrying the lies, you are complicit in spreading his racist views and falsehood. #ResignTrump
@VP 2/2 Criminal history can mean having a DUI, or anything else that's a misdemeanor. It could also be someone that has been caught repeatedly entering the US. There is no need for a wall, or for a national emergency.
@VP 1/2 I would like to know where you get these fantasy numbers from. 90% of heroine does not come from the southern border. If it does, then it's not through the open borders. It's through legal points of entry. The majority comes by boat in shipping containers.
@TODAYshow @NBCNews Why? This is just a hate filled view of a racist @Potus that seeks to further tear our country apart. There were plenty of times that you didn't air Obama and this should be one of the times you don't air #Trump
@JohnCornyn The reality is that he actually doesn't support the wall. Again, at any time during the last two years, he could have forced it through. Period. McConnell is a coward and doesn't want to deal with the wall issue, that's why he's passing it off to @TheDemocrats and #Trump
RT @JohnCornyn: Irony is, the US government’s difficulty in dealing with humanitarian and national security crisis at the border is directl…
@JohnCornyn If a wall is so important to the security of this country, then why didn't @senatemajldr ever go nuclear and go with a simple majority to pass the funding for the wall. Why didn't @POTUS @realDonaldTrump accept the #DACA agreement that included $25 billion for the wall? Why?
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump I view you as a Russian agent that is bent on the destruction of America and its values. The president is holding Americans hostage in his negotiations and Putin approves of what he's doing. It's sad that you're pushing garbage. #smh #sad
@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump When can we expect him to open up the FEMA concentration camps and move all non-whites into them? Lou, really, come on. You should know that he's a showman and is taking the country for a ride to the park and abandon us as he steps on the gas stealing our money. #smh
@GregAbbott_TX @rockportpilot You mean to tell me that @SecretaryPerry school funding was a complete failure? Just like him? Let’s stop cutting education and fully fund our schools. Conservatives have slashed school funding beyond its core.
@GOP Hey, you need to take off 800k from that number due to the #TrumpShutdown.
@realDonaldTrump Are you also going to be addressing getting the fed back open and paying everyone you laid off? Won’t watch it because it’s pure propaganda and no better than the apprentice was.
#Falseflag @cnn @MSNBC @FoxNews @NBCNews @politico @nytimes @RedState @YourAnonNews We have president that is so desperate for a wall, that he may create an false attack when he visits the border to justify a wall and a national emergency. Be on the lookout.
@corockymtns @LouDobbs @realdonald @BreitbartNews @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @POTUS @VP @FoxNews Through airports. Are you Russian? This is going to be fun. If you're so scared of terrorist, just stay home and cower in a closet. #GoodbyeFelicia
@ThisWeekABC At any point in time during their holding both houses, they could have easily gone nuclear much like @senatemajldr has done in the past. He didn't because he doesn't want a wall. End of story.
@ThisWeekABC Liz Cheney is the one captive to the far right. The border has been there since it was negotiated with Mexico and we've not seen any type of crisis in the order that they're making it out to be. It's not about a wall, but about them not passing the damn bills they wanted.
@FoxNewsSunday @PressSec If you believe what #SHS has to say, then I would like to sell you some ocean front property in Arizona. It has the most wonderful beach and you don't have to worry about hurricanes.
@Game6cards11 @GregAbbott_TX @JZmirak What are you talking about? From or to? Apple already has a 2nd HQ in Austin Texas that can be expanded to 15k already and they are further adding a second location that will employ at minimum another 5k with more room to grow, #smh
@GregAbbott_TX E-verify is down due to #TrumpShutdown and it won't be open for sometime it appears. How are employers going to verify if someone is eligible to work in the US when #TrumpsShutdown is going on?
@ByronYork According to govt reports, illegal border crossing is at its lowest point in decades. How can there be a record number of families streaming over the border if it's at its lowest point? https://t.co/Udhplhioiu
@BobDolan111 @CNN Those are funds allocated to #FEMA and have already been approved. This is not a national emergency and will be challenged in court. Which congress can do. He cannot shift funds that the military has for non-military project or use. The wall is not a military project
@corockymtns @LouDobbs @realdonald @BreitbartNews @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @POTUS @VP @FoxNews I actually feel quite secure and safe from all of those without the wall. I'm a realist and know that the terrorist that caused 9/11 came here with passports and visas. How #sad it is that you can't see the real picture that we have a fraud in the #WH.
@LouDobbs @POTUS I believe when he says, "We," that it's more of the royal we and not him and the others working on the wall. https://t.co/NAtfNvMO0A
@docmoc @ChuckRossDC @benshapiro But we've had no wall for generations and we've had no catastrophes. So if that's the case, then once we have a wall, we shall at that time fall to catastrophes!
RT @chitovela3: It’s hard to listen to the debate on border security having grown up on the US/Mexico border, crossed it hundreds of times,…
@realDonaldTrump You do realize with 800k fed employees furloughed and not working, that they are filing for unemployment and will be reflected against January's job numbers and unemployment claims? If you cook the books enough, then we'll see a drop again next month and fake numbers.
@LouDobbs @realdonald @BreitbartNews So he has no care for some 800k fed employees not getting paid, and thousands of other businesses that rely on them for their own income? This isn't about immigration. This is about his ego and him not wanting to lose his base. It's nothing to do about security.
@realDonaldTrump You’ll need to import steel and the cost will still be very high. The money that is being asked for doesn’t include any of the infrastructure for roads, electric, water plus other necessities needed. They told you about building a wall as a joke. #smh
@CNN He can't. It's not a national emergency and he still needs congress to approve the spending. The president cannot shift money allocated for usage in a department to another himself.
@MeetThePress Only if @senatemajldr lets it. He has the power to bring bills to a vote on the floor and if both house can agree on an appropriate spending bill, they can override a veto. This is moving from a #TrumpShutdown to #McConnelShutdown.
@realDonaldTrump But you turn a blind eye when it comes to radical white american terrorism. You have no problem supporting racist or pedos? And Obama was on duty when Osama was killed and Mexico turned over Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán. Those were bigger prizes. #smh #ResignTrump
@FoxNewsSunday @PressSec 3/3 There's also the large amount of workers needed. Housing, food, water, sanitation and construction of multiple infrastructures needed to reach the sites. Roads, electricity, water, waste water removal, waste removal, etc, etc. $25 billion would just be a drop in the bucket
@FoxNewsSunday @PressSec 2/3 You would need to have multiple companies willing to build the wall. Those companies could face loss of business from other companies for building the wall. There is procurement of needed material which means diverting it from other public and private projects,
@FoxNewsSunday @PressSec You have one point right. A responsibility of the president it to protect the country. A wall does not do that. The cost factor has not been realized and would take over a decade to complete. Eminent domain would be fought in court for years as property owners would fight it.
@realDonaldTrump Your win pales in comparison to Reagan. There are many verified reports of collusion with Russia. Your administration passed the fewest major bills in the first two years. You keep shouting at Mexican shaped clouds in the sky and don't know the difference between a fence or wall.
@realDonaldTrump Not true at all. Reports state that you were suggested the wall to distract you and keep you on target for illegal immigrants. When people around you laugh, they're not laughing with you, they're laughing at you. https://t.co/g6mWaKPFIq
@DailyCaller Numerous members of congress have been sworn in using other books. Plus, John Adams stated, “The government of the United States is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion.”		In fact, many of the founding fathers were theist, not christians.
@NAACP Let's not forget every single business that has also been affected by their loss of income. That can push those numbers closer to 1 million people being affected by the closer.
@Double_M215 @eahernandez16 @realDonaldTrump That money cannot be given directly to fund the wall. It would go to an account for gifts to the government. Only a bill passed by congress would allow those funds to go towards building the wall. And there will never be a billed passed by this congress for that.
@realDonaldTrump That's a fence and not a wall. #smh
@LouDobbs I don't see turtle man bringing this to a vote in the senate. Would be nice for some limits, but those can be to short. Maybe senate 3 six year terms, and house 6 or 7 two year terms. Followed by a 10 year period where they cannot be a lobbyist to the US house or senate.
@LouDobbs It's still continuing the trend from under Obama.
@realDonaldTrump @DRUDGE_REPORT 4If we were to take into account the 800k jobs that are either furloughed or people that are working as slaves, no pay, then you have a loss of 488k jobs. Understand this, that all 800k of those people can claim unemployment. We'll see how it works out for the numbers this month.
@VP @WhiteHouse And that is exactly what the Russians and Putin want.
@VP @WhiteHouse You’re what I will start to view as being compromised by the Russians. You’re not an American and no longer represent us.
@VP @WhiteHouse This shutdown could be affecting close to a million people. The economic loss is hard for employees and businesses across the board. This is #TrumpShutdown2019 as he stated he takes full responsibility for it.
@VP @WhiteHouse You keep saying that there’s a crisis at the southern border but you aren’t providing any proof. You’re trying to scare people into believing a lie. Not only are 800k fed emps hurting, but so are hundreds of businesses that rely on them. Restaurants, bars, and stores.
@GOP @SteveScalise It’s not about keeping the country safe. Get over it. It’s about a lame duck president that is afraid of losing his base because just like in bed, he can’t deliver.
@GOP Hey, those 800k fed workers, can they apply for unemployment? Because if they can, I think we’d see a large jump in unemployment claims.
RT @sarahwoodwriter: @seanhannity It's just locker room talk, Sean. Lighten up.
@seanhannity Then condemn everything sexually graphic thing #Trump has said. Put. Up. Or. Shut. Up.
@GOP @VP Where are the videos of this so called crisis on the border? Why isn’t the news media, including Faux News, Druggy Limbaugh, False Hannity, showing is what’s going on at the border? You know why? Because there’s not dick going on at the border. Some $2 billion not being used.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Only 1.7 million pounds of narcotics? That’s like 1% or less of what comes across in boats, cars, trucks or other means. A wall doesn’t stop them from coming through legal ports of entry.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Kommrad, you care not about the Americans people. Is looks good in mother Russian a Putin must approves you do. / Only a freaking shitbag doesn’t care about the people he’s supposed to be governing. You have no morals or soul. #ResignTrump #TrumpResign #TrumpRussia
@GOP @PressSec Then cutoff Israel and let them fall. We have no business giving them money or support.
@GOP @GOPChairwoman #FauxNews is a govt controlled propaganda channel that should never be listened to or taken seriously. There’s about $2 billion in funding that remains largely untouched. Use that first for border security.
@CNN They shouldn't be getting a pay raise at all. They need to open the govt and get people back to work so they don't lose everything that they have.
@FaceTheNation @jaredkushner @VP @SecNielsen @MickMulvaneyOMB @senatemajldr Should be at the #WH talking with them on getting things back opened and helping the 800k fed employees back to work. He won't though, as he's to afraid of the Don.
@seanhannity Hey Sean. Can you talk about this more? It really should be brought out how much less the top 1% pay in taxes than the rest of the American Taxpayers. At one time, the top rate was around 80%. Now the top 1% can pay less or actually no income taxes at all.
@Trump45MAGA @realDonaldTrump Why not try it and see what happens. How long would you still support him if he did and the dems said, "finally a great idea." and they didn't build it?
@realDonaldTrump Not true at all. We should cut all aid to Israel and let the fall as they may. You have already been given close to $2 billion that still has not been touched. The wall isn't about security for our country, but your insecurity and being terrified that your base will abandon you.
#RuinABandNameWithOneLetter Mule
@JohnCornyn @WTOP Plus, nowhere in that article does it even mention Mexico or Mexican drug cartels. And that's just pure BS that 90% is from Mexico. There are drug labs all across the states that can produce the drugs,
@JohnCornyn @WTOP The major majority is through legal points of entry. Traversing an open border with no drop off point for tons of drugs does not happen. There are semis, boats, plains and other means of transportation that carry well over 90% of it. A wall does not stop that.
@realDonaldTrump You do realize, that it is possible that they can reopen the govt still? If @senatemajldr would allow a vote on a clean CR, and you veto it, it can be overridden. That's called, checks and balances. https://t.co/NycwDPJJY3
@BobbyJindal @NancyPelosi has already brushed aside #ImpeachTrump for now. They are still awaiting Mueller's report. Als, you were the worst Gov of Louisiana has ever had.
@ABC @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @GOP @senatemajldr Had @senatemajldr wanted to help #Trump fund the wall, he could have done so at anytime. Yet he didn't. He does not want to deal with the issue. He's turtling up and if asked directly, he states that it's between @TheDemocrats and the #WH
@ABC @POTUS @realDonaldTrump and the @GOP had two years of control of congress and yet they never went nuclear to fully fund the wall. They could have done so at anytime. Now @senatemajldr is ducking the issue as he doesn't want to deal with it. He does not want the wall.
@seanhannity Why not contact every member of congress to see if they're going to give up their pay too? https://t.co/kHopBKODEZ
@realDonaldTrump See, I too can use random capitalization in my tweets to look like you. #Idiot #shm
@realDonaldTrump So you're admitting that you HAVE had campaign VIOLATIONS. You've taken large sums of Money and should also be paying large Fines. Cool Story that you admit that you're a Criminal. However, using money from your charity to pay yourself and your debts is Criminal.
@realDonaldTrump Mexico is to be paying for the wall. You have close to $2 billion in unspent funds for border security already. You’re like talking to someone’s crazy racist grandpa that has lost grip on reality. #smh #sad Not everyone wants the damn wall. https://t.co/HLip4Jbzqi
@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump He has already been given almost $2 billion for border security and has only spent around 6% of it. Why should he be given additional funding if he hasn't allocated and used what already has? It's because he's insecure and desires attention. #smh
@ABC So they'll call her out, but they're perfectly fine with members of the #GOP using similar words and they're ok saying that there is nothing wrong with one of their own raping women? Yeah, that's not how it's supposed to work.
@GregAbbott_TX Please direct us to where in the constitution it states that we should build a border wall? And Perry? He's a bigger fool than #Trump is.
@politico Sure if @realDonaldTrump has been using white lines or if he's found some tabs he may think that they support him, but none of the current living presidents have ever come out in support of a wall.
@MichelleBlaisd6 @seanhannity They cannot use money that has not been allocated for the wall. Using military funds for non-military projects like the security wall would appear to violate federal and congressional rules governing defense appropriations.
@seanhannity He still can't build a wall without funding. He can call an national emergency, but congress still needs to provide the funds for the wall. Which they won't.
@DiamondandSilk Maybe these two could have some of that money and get a makeover? Stupid is as stupid does.
@cbsaustin @tedcruz Some how I doubt that Mitch will let it come to the floor for a vote.
@politico I would say that McConnell is like an ostrich with its head in the sand, but ostriches have more common sense and know when to pop their heads out.
@LouDobbs Lou, do you support the president destroying the lives of 800k federal employees and them facing possible loss of home and their financial security? Because that’s what the baby really is doing.
@rufuspatch1 @LtSnowOvernight @LouDobbs The USMCA is DoA. It needs to be approved by both houses in order for it be approved and enacted. It will never pass the House and the Senate majority was also again it.
@realDonaldTrump Easy. Your a criminal and have committed acts of treason. That’s how
@FaceTheNation @realDonaldTrump Not one previous president agrees that a wall should be built. https://t.co/T5FP6hrhzk
@CBSNews @POTUS The amount of steel needed would far surpass even $30 billion dollars. It would take up to 20 years to build and that’s not including the infrastructure for roads, electric and water to the sites. #Trump is one of these exaggerated villains that gets offed at yen end of a movie.
@ThisWeekABC Productive? That’s not what they’re saying. @realDonaldTrump You’re saying that your ok with keeping the govt shutdown for a long time. Possibly years. #smh 800k people not getting paid and looking at losing everything that they have.
@DailyCaller @AOC She pretty and having fun dancing to music 🎼. If you think that there’s something wrong with that, then you’re the type that must hate kittens and puppies.
@GOP The GOP had two years of controlling both houses and the #WH. If they really and truly wanted a wall to be funded, they could have gone nuclear. Immoral is not opening the govt and keeping 800k people from earning a paycheck.
@McConnellPress @KentuckyNewEra @senatemajldr The situation of 800k fed employees demands our attention. The wall is a vanity project that’s not needed. This is just as much your shutdown as it is #TrumpsShutdown
@JohnCornyn @YahooNews This is what I think about #Trump and his border wall. https://t.co/ZgBHp4eIE2
@realDonaldTrump This happens every holiday season between Nov and Dec. We’ll look at the Jan numbers which show these seasonal jobs being let go. #idiot
@VP @POTUS Seasonal jobs. What about the 800k jobs that the shutdown has affected? That does not include thousands of other jobs that are also being affected.
@realDonaldTrump We have a president that has, Delusions of Grandeur, simply because no one in his life has ever told him, No. He believes that he's always right and that only what he thinks matters. This is not good for him or our country. #sad #wrong #TrumpResignNOW
@JohnCornyn @epheraldpost John, seriously. Drop the wall funding request. This is no longer about border security. It's about a frat boy that is trying not to lose face with what he thinks are his friends. He believes that without the funding, that he'll look like a fool. He already does. Open the Gov't
@senatemajldr You are part owner in this shutdown. You are no looking to work with Dems. The fact is that you calling for bipartisanship is a farce. You have already suspended the rules on judges, which should also be 60 votes, why not on the funding bill? What do the Russians have on you?
@ABC Not only doe he own the shutdown, but Mitch co-owns it as he is refusing to allow anything to come to a vote that the House passes.
RT @AOC: Over 200 members voted for Nancy Pelosi today, yet the GOP only booed one: me.		Don’t hate me cause you ain’t me, fellas 💁🏽‍♀️ htt…
@GOPLeader @GOP Uh huh. Is that why you want to shutdown Planned Parenthood? Is that why the @GOP wants to make it harder for minorities to vote? Freedom you say? That’s total rubbish. https://t.co/9vtyvrfRiF
@JimK06893129 @NBCNews The “committee access” provision passed in 1924 gives select congressional committees the ability to obtain anyone’s tax records. @TheDemocrats have the ability to appoint members to them. Houses and Means and Joint committee on taxation. All they do is request them to get them
@BillOReilly Never have and never will. #sad #wrong crazy old man is shouting at clouds again.
@realDonaldTrump If this was about the achievements of “Trump”, then why did you 👈🏾lose the house? Why did so many governorships flip? You’re running scared and everything is spinning out of control. You can’t and won’t win.
@BillOReilly He’s running scared and is afraid to lose face with his base. That’s what this is all about now. Ask him point blank, “are you concerned about being canceled next season if you don’t get the wall built?” Then wait for his reaction.
@BillOReilly Bill, it’s no longer about border security. It’s about a president that is so afraid of losing ratings, not voters but ratings in his mind, and losing his position as president. He bragged that Mexico would pay for the wall and now that they aren’t, he desperately seeking an out.
@BillOReilly Over 60% come here legally on visas that then overstay the visa. There are also many that come here with a spouse, parent, or other family member and have incomplete paperwork.
@GOP @SteveScalise I seriously doubt that both #Trump and #Pence stayed at the #WH over the holidays.
@realDonaldTrump @GOP There was only one seat that was flipped in the senate to red. ONE! And 40 lost in the house. Plus multiple governorships that were flipped to Dems. #smh Someone either can’t read, or is ignoring reality.
That's what this is now all about. He's enjoying a life that goes beyond what he's had and doesn't want to let go of it. He never would have met the world leaders he's met. He sees the position of president as a never empty wallet. #sad #smh
@potus @realDonaldTrump is acting like a frat boy that is trying to brag  he's going to do something, yet he never does. He doesn't look at his base without think that they're just ratings. He believes that if he doesn't build the wall, he'll look like a fool and will be canceled
@JohnCornyn @WSJopinion Going to repeat myself. It's not about border security, It's about a president that is afraid he's going to look like a fool because he knows the wall will not be built. It's like he looks at his base and sees tv ratings. That's what it's about now. So open your eyes to reality.
@realDonaldTrump It's not about border security. It's about you feeling like you'll look like a fool with promising something that was never going to happen. Get over it. Admit to your base that at this time, there won't be a wall. You're acting like a frat boy that brags but never wins #smh
@CR @RandPaul At least Ron...well fuck. I can't think of anything nice about his dad or him. Mittens has at least been a Gov and...well he at least has the the #1A to speak his mind about #Trump. That's all I can come up with,
@DailyCaller In other words, he will throw out bipartisanship and become a #Trumpbaby not wanting to listen or deal with the Dems. He should have gone nuclear and destroyed what little dignity he had. If he had any.
@DailyCaller As a #Longhorn fan, this is just stupid. I don't read #clickbait titles, but Texas is a quality team this year and is ranked in the top 25. I seriously doubt that people are calling for the to be ejected from the #SEC. #smh
@NightlyPolitics But #SSN and Medicare are self sufficient and don't receive federal funding. It receives money from FICA collected on payroll checks. Cutting SSN does not go back to the Fed's bank account. It remains with SSN and is raid by the GOP trying to cause it to fail.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump This has nothing to do with border security, kommrade. It has to do with him stating he’s going to build a wall have Mexico pay, getting elected and realizing it ain’t happening.
@jessica111124 @DanCrenshawTX As a Texan, nope. Even the people that own property on the border don’t want it.
@NBCNews Then it’s not just a #TrumpsShutdown it’s also a #GOPShutdown #mitchmcconnellshutdown
@ThisWeekABC Sounds like a mob boss. This president expects everyone to give him what he wants. He’s going to find out the hard way that the new House won’t fold.
@JohnCornyn Trump has almost $2 billion already allocated to border security but hasn’t touched it yet. He is demanding money for a phallic object. You should be opposed to a government that is looking to take a Texan’s property for something that destroys the environment.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Can we get this Russian controlled account banned from #Twitter? It’s ridiculous that it’s allowed to continue. The orange one is not committed to making the US safe. His sowing hatred and racism. #smh
@NRO @jackrcrowe Stupid autocorrect. Mattis, but knowing Trump, he probably thinks his name is Mattie. Hell he called Melania, Melanie.
@NRO @jackrcrowe Mattie resigned. You can’t fire someone that has already resigned. He gave two months notice. Letting him go earlier is not firing him. #sadTrump is #sad.
@ThisWeekABC Seriously, the way he holds and crosses his arms seems like he has autism. He’s not all there that’s for sure. Be it that or dementia, he’s seems more confused than Reagan.
@politico Some how the phrase, I really don’t care, do u? Comes to mind. Plus, I seriously doubt that he was alone. I’m sure he had hookers and provided them with some six packs hoping for some golden showers.
@seanhannity But has anyone shown up yet? Seeing how Congress doesn’t convene until Thursday, I don’t think that they’re even in town yet.
@realDonaldTrump What? The #USMCA hasn’t even been approved or voted for. It will never be approved as both houses have already rejected it. Also, wall hasn’t been fully renovated. The $5.6 billion doesn’t pay for anything really. #sad #wrong Mexico hasn’t paid anything towards the wall.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump He has been given $2 billion for border security that he hasn’t touched. Why should he be given more money when he still hasn’t utilized the money he’s been given?
@LouDobbs Lou. The GOP has controlled the senate and they have been able to confirm numerous appointments as those usually take a simple majority. The idiot in the #WH das dementia and doesn't understand what a president does or is supposed to do. It's the GOP that does bad faith.
@JohnCornyn These children are not arriving with illnesses. It's due to the living conditions of the #kidjails that they are getting sick. Taking these kids from their parents creates stress and despair which can have a major impact on  kids health. Stop the insanity of family separation.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump The new session begins on January 3. They will meet with him on their terms, and when they feel that it's the right time to do so. That's when they pass their bill and send it to the senate.
@realDonaldTrump It takes a simple majority to approve nominations for judges and appointments. Excluding SCOTUS. Even then, McConnell went nuclear on nominations. There have been more appointments confirmed in the last few months than during Obama’s term. #smh #sad
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS You’ve tweeted about a wall almost a dozen times today. You’re running scared and you know that you’ll not get funding for it. You’re afraid to lose face with your base and are seen as a liar across the globe. No one really likes you. Your base is irrelevant as they’re sheeple.
@realDonaldTrump The president has nothing to do with the price of gas. It’s based on the cost of a barrel of oil. That itself depends on the output of oil and the production cost of converting it to gas. Winter blend of gas is lower than summer. It’s also not like a tax cut. #sad
@realDonaldTrump Then why isn’t #Canada building a wall along their southern border? I’m sure there are people up there saying the same thing about the US. More drugs and smugglers use valid points of entry to come across than the open borders.
@realDonaldTrump They’re still building nukes and their still upgrading their sites. They’ve been lying all along and they will continue to do so. Just like you continue to lie about everything you talk about.
@realDonaldTrump The Washington Examiner is a rag mag. There’s nothing good in it.
@realDonaldTrump Except for the fact that US oil producers will cut back and layoff workers as the need to maintain profit and prices. A president also does not control Gad prices. It’s set by the market and oil production cost.
@GOP @PressSec There's no one in #DC at this time as they are on a holiday break. McConnell isn't even in town. You think that congress is going to give up their holiday for #babytrump? Doubt it. It's up to both houses to talk once congress reconvenes come Thursday. #TrumpsShutdown
@JohnCornyn He was offered $25 billion in exchange for #DACA. He agreed and then came back an hour or so later and declined it. That shows he's not capable of making an art of the deal. #sad
@realDonaldTrump Stop fucking using random capital letters, you idiot! It doesn't make you look smart and shows that you're an uneducated moron. They're not giving you a wall at all. Get over it. The GOP both houses and the WH, yet they failed to provide you with the funding for a wall. #smh
@realDonaldTrump You tweeted this what, about 100x this past month? No idea how many because I simply stopped counting. You seem to be scared of what's about to happen to you. Aren't you? You feel that cold clammy hand on your shoulder and hot breath the nape of your neck. He's coming SOON™! https://t.co/jg7v4FJlnC
@realDonaldTrump You seem to be having issues with capitalization. Did you not take english in school? And a wall is not the solution. It doesn't do what you think it does. The majority of drugs and people that are smuggled in, are through legal ports of entry. #sad https://t.co/3lijMAl8AH
@Governor_LePage Hey about that so called stolen election you remarked about. It wasn't. Ranked voting provided the proper results. You're just upset that it didn't work in your favor. Had it, you'd be saying how great it is. https://t.co/NclkjSqI5v
@GOP And #Nixon was the first president to go to China. That didn't end well for him and it will not end well for #Trump. Oh yeah, NK continues to work on it's nuke projects and is laughing at him. 🚀
@VP Remember the 25th and then remember that Mueller will be coming after you once he's done with #Trump. #TrumpResign #PenceResign #GOPShutdown #TrumpShutdown
@realDonaldTrump Shouting like that makes you come across as a 12 or 13 yr old spamming crap in #MMOs. Well, to compare you to them is an insult to them...at least they have a bit more common sense. Also, the Dems have the House. I don't see a great year for you or the Senate. #sad #smh
@realDonaldTrump gorka is a known racist and works for a company that supports pedos. The #PoS should be jailed for his actions and doesn't deserve any praise. You're support shows you also support racism and pedos. Plus, you don't read. That book came out July 2018. It's not new. #smh
Sure #HappyNewYears. Hopefully we'll see this current presidency come to and end soon. #ResignTrump #TrumpShutdown
@GOP @realDonaldTrump What promise is he keeping? Because he sure isn't keeping that one. It will not pass the house and #NAFTA is doing what it's supposed to do. Texas has about $54 billion in trade with Mexico and close to 1 millions jobs tied to it. Scrap that, and it's economy collapses.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump You picked up one seat in the senate and lost the house by 40 seats. That isn't something to crow about.
@realDonaldTrump Here's why they aren't listening to you cry and beg them to come back. https://t.co/VejiZaFAlP
@realDonaldTrump No one is calling. You have tinnitus which makes you think heads of countries are call...wait, what do you mean by heads of countries? That's not proper english! You mean Heads of States? What the hell do you mean!!?? #smh Why can't we have a cool leader like other countries do?
@realDonaldTrump #smh that there are people stupid enough to believe in you even after multiple bankruptcies and failed marriages.
@realDonaldTrump Walls decay and fall down. There comes a time when a wall is no longer needed as it's seen as a barrier that hinders one's growth. And there's no need to emphasize the word "never" or "always" such as you're doing. 🤕
@realDonaldTrump Also, only morons use capital letters when there is no need too.
@realDonaldTrump You also had two years of controlling both houses, yet neither Ryan or McConnell went nuclear to get your wall funding. #sad They knew that it was just a fantasy and never had any plans to help you build it.
@realDonaldTrump That's because you have no concept of technology. You can barely use a smartphone. The only thing you manage to do is tweet, and that's debatable. The cost to build the infrastructure to get to the remote areas where the wall would go, cost more than the wall itself. #sad #wrong
@ActuallyNPH @Unfortunate Still waiting for more of Dr. Horrible singalong, Neil.
@seanhannity He’s as bad as Jeb asking people to please clap. He’s fucked up big time and he knows it. He had $25 billion in trade for #DACA and because you whispered into his head to reject it, he’s not a damn thing now. #sad
@realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣 Oh god your the best troll that I’ve ever come across. #Nafta is controlled by congress and not you. Congress is the one that approves trade agreements that you give to them. They are NOT paying for a wall. You had TWO years controlling WH and houses. You failed bigly.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Bush claimed victory too, but it wasn’t so. There still isn’t a victory as #ISIL is still very active and waiting for you to retreat so they can hit back harder.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS You and the @gop had complete control of Congress to pass your racist policies but they knew better than to give into you. They could have gone nuclear but didn’t as they knew your policies were wrong. #sad #TrumpChristmasShutdown #TrumpDerangemantSyndrome #ResignTrump
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS More drugs flow through valid points of entry than the open borders. Same with smugglers.  You campaigned on lies and ignorant people bought into those lies. You had $25 billion and threw it away. More people overstay visas than cross the border illegally. #sad #wrong
@realDonaldTrump A wall around a house works because it’s protecting a small area. A wall that’s some 2,000 miles long won’t work as you’d need someone to watch it every so many miles or feet. Of you want a wall, then put your own money to help fund.
@CBSNews #Trump was offered $25 billion in exchange for #DACA back in June. He first agreed, and then Hannity, or someone whispered in his ear to reject it. Also, the courts have ruled that he cannot cancel DACA. He has lost on bth parts and they aren't coming back.
@CBSNews He has already been given almost $2 billion for border security that he hasn't touched yet. Unlike his daughter Ivanka, which he has probably touched repeatedly. #wrong #TrumpShutdown
@realDonaldTrump You're the one that has stated that it is your, #TrumpChristmasShutdown as you stated that you are taking responsibility for it. Don't try and throw it to your #Russianbots to claim otherwise. Plus, Mitch and the rest of the @GOP have also left town. Jan 3 is really close. #sad
@DailyCaller She has money and is taking a trip. I'm sure that she's paying for everything, unlike #Trump's trips to Mar a Lago where the taxpayers are paying for it to Trump for staying at his own hotel. And all the golf cart fees.
@realDonaldTrump Uhm, seriously doubt that. You got a link? I find that to be a farce.
@realDonaldTrump That there was much suffering he was sheltered from. You shelter yourself from the real world behind a tv screen which you can't distinguish from real life. Fox and Hannity are not make believe &amp; are doing more harm than good. Turn off tv and twitter. It's too late, but #Walkaway
@realDonaldTrump These people seeking asylum are coming to a valid point of entry. They are not entering the country illegally. How sad that you are walled up in you own little world and that you have been sheltered from the real world. When Buddha left the walls of his family, he realized
@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs You have a really troubling obsession for Hillary, don’t you? You saw her ass during the debate and you want to tap it, Don. Just let it go as she’s not into you. #sad
@realDonaldTrump Dude, what is it with you and the @GOP just not letting go of HIllary? Do you get a chubby every time you think about or mention her? Were you just staring at her ass during the debate when you were behind her? Come on, admit that you want to nail her.
@realDonaldTrump But the military has already been given a 10% pay raise and you’ve already signed a large military spending bill.
@LouDobbs Not only that, but he cannot close the border. Americans have the right to cross the border. Also, asylum seekers, per federal law, have the right to cross the border. He cannot close it. Period.
@LouDobbs He was already given $2 billion towards border security and he hasn't used that yet. Why should he be given more money when there's already money waiting to be spent? Plus, he's negotiating against himself and is dropping the amount he's asking for.
@NRO Mexico was to pay for the wall according to #Trump. Not the American taxpayer. Trump is an idiot and even on the Apprentice, he didn't make the call on who to keep, fire or who the winner would be. The man's IQ is of an amoeba. Which is an insult to all amoebas to be compared to
@PhilBryantMS He can't. Federal law will not allow him to shut down the border. That's because US citizens have the right to cross the border. Asylum seekers have the right to cross the border. Again, by federal law. Therefore, he has no authority to close the border.
@Governor_LePage Hey LePage, I just have this to say... https://t.co/6kA7gXNxbu
@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump Lou, close the windows and sit down. Prepare some nice hot tea with some honey. Once you do that and double check to make sure that the windows are closed, you won't be shouting at the clouds in the sky. https://t.co/lfYAnKeVAE
@GOP They had offered $25 billion in exchange for #DACA this past June. #Trump stated that he was willing to accept it, and then he was talked out of it by some of his handlers, and rejected it. He stated that this was his shutdown and it is #TrumpShutdown. Plain and simple.
@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump He can't just terminate trade deals. That is the job of congress to approve or reject a trade deal. He cannot just close of the borders as he cannot restrict American citizens from crossing in and out of the country. He's #sad #wrong and so are you.
@realDonaldTrump You have no idea about trade. Texas alone does some $54 billion in trade with Mexico. And they have a trade surplus, not a loss. Texas has a million jobs tied to #NAFTA. It will not be a profit making operation. It will be a bigger loss than your casinos. #sad #wrong
Richard Overton, rest in peace sir. You saw a world that changed more than you probably thought could be imagined.
@BillOReilly It took 700 days plus and being shamed by the media to get him to go and he turned it into a political rally. He lied about a pay raise when there isn’t one. This is why he is being bashed. Stop drinking the koolaide. #sad #wrong
@LindseyGrahamSC How does a border wall help against radical Islam? This text makes zero sense. 🤔 If there are any, they came here on a visa. By plane or a boat. https://t.co/627epoI8K6
@seanhannity Cut Israel funding off. Let them fend for themselves.
@PressSec It’s not CNN attacking them, it’s that they’re pointing out the policy of the DoD. Much like other agencies stating the same thing.
@JohnCornyn He wasn't separating families from each other and placing kids in kiddy jails like Sessions and Trump have done. He was working to help the people that came over. Those 2014 photos are of unaccompanied children. Not of families that were seperated. I know, you can impeach Obama.
@realDonaldTrump The wall is not going to get built as it is a waste of money and will not stop people from crossing the border illegally. It hasn't where it's been built.
@realDonaldTrump Wait. You actually took the time to see what party affiliation every single person you have affected is associated with? TD, it doesn't matter a person's political affiliation, the ones affected are #AMERICANS that you destroying their lives with #TrumpShutdown. Grow up...
@LouDobbs People have been coming to the US for decades. Nothing will change no matter what passes. A wall doesn’t stop people from coming here either. The majority come legally &amp; either overstay their visas, or have incomplete paper that makes them illegal until the paperwork is completed
@seanhannity When a president has to be shamed into visiting the troops overseas, it’s meaningless.
@realDonaldTrump I don't call that putting America first.
@realDonaldTrump The market fell 650 points in just half a day of trading. Just imagine if it was a full day of trading. That could have been over 1,000 points. #ResignTrump #TrumpResign #TrumpShutdown #sad #wrong There are 4 days left of trading this year &amp; the market could dip under 21k easily

The things makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside, is that @realDonaldTrump is Spending Christmas Eve all alone in the WH. It seems that not even his family is with him. aww. Maybe he should tweet more so he won't feel all icky and yuck. https://t.co/2iTrF3Vsug
@realDonaldTrump Also, if you're trying to claim eminent domain for a property, there is a long long process that you would have to go through. It would take years to go through court of people fighting the claim. #sad #wrong #idiotNtheWhiteHouse
@realDonaldTrump Uhm, you can't give out contracts just like that. They have to go through a bidding process, which is required by federal law, and these bids must be made public. You're lying just like you always do, or you're illegally circumventing congress which must approve these contracts.
@realDonaldTrump Uhm, until there is an official announcement on tv, your full of it. No one believes you anymore.
@realDonaldTrump That was their money. There was $400 million which was for a payment of military equipment from 1979. Plus $1.3 billion in interest. Again, it was their money. Educate yourself, idiot. https://t.co/8hw6bJmgnh
@atw330 @LukeLastJedi1 @realDonaldTrump I believe you mean, he uses the Farce.
@PressSec So thoughts and prayers? They don't pay for living expenses. Every single one of the government workers that are not getting a paycheck can tell you where to stick your blessings. #ResignSHS #ResignTrump
@GOP You are part of the Trump Russian propaganda machine. The account is not a viable account that is for the American people or voice. The wall is a farce and does nothing to strengthen border security. The majority of traffic is through valid ports of entry. Delete this account now
@realDonaldTrump You had $25 billion offered to you in exchange for #DACA, but you declined it. You’re the only one to blame for not getting funding when you had it in your hands. #sad #wrong no sympathy for you. Just the 100s of thousands that are not getting paid working for the #Fed
@GOP @senatemajldr There has never been the crisis that #Trump claims there is at the border. I bet some 95% of the drugs and everything else he claims comes through legal points of entry. You’re an enabler and you along with president dumbass need an intervention. #smh

@GOP @PressSec A border wall does not stop these from coming through legal means. #sad #wrong #ResignTrump
@GOP @PressSec More drugs, trafficking and terrorist come through legal ports of entry, not the open border crossings. The Saudis that caused 9/11 came here on visas. Many people overstay their visas and are never heard from again. Vehicles crossing the border bring more drugs than packs can.
@JohnCornyn And what about the original bill that was passed without funding? Trump listened not to advisors, but to talk shows. That's what an insane person does. He listens to the people on tv. Why don't you speak to him yourself?
@JohnCornyn Actually, #TrumpChristmasShutdown. You're right, there was an offer made to build the wall in exchange for #DACA. #Trump should have taken it as he would of had his funding. However, since the courts ruled Trump can't stop DACA, they have no reason to fund the wall.
@politico 6. He's actually someone that most people would be willing to have a beer with.	7. He skateboards.	8. He streams FB videos.	9. He's actually from Texas.	10. He loves Whataburger.
@politico 1. O'Rourke is a House representative, so he has won.	2. He did better than any other democrat that's run in the last couple of decades.	3. He drew larger crowds than #Trump ever had.	4. He actually will cross the line when it comes to voting on the floor.	5. He was in a band
@RudyGiuliani Because of #DACA. That was the sticking point and know that the courts have clearly stated that #Trump can't kill DACA, there's no reason for them to agree to any funding for a wall. Educate yourself and you might just become somewhat tolerable. #idiots
@realDonaldTrump You didn't decimate ISIS. They're still around by the thousands. Also, your not even in the top 50 favorite presidents. That includes the presidents pre-constitution. Which there were 8 of.
@realDonaldTrump What crisis? Most of the border crossing happens at legal ports of entry. #shm #sad #wrong #ResignTrump #TrumpResign
@realDonaldTrump Da faq? Even without a wall, our country is still extremely safe. This new fence that you have proposed is a phallic fantasy of yours since you have a little plank. #smh and you still lost the popular vote. The greatest of all times is Reagan.
@JohnCornyn The naming of a post office is pure fluff. There's no reason to brag or mention it. If you want to let you constituents in those areas know fine, but it's still meaningless.
@GOP @GOPChairwoman No. The House chose to given to two radio host that pushed the president to reject the CR since it did not have wall funding. TWO RADIO HOST. That's why the CR was changed to include wall funding. #Trump would have signed it without funding had he not listened to the radio host
Not just #trumpresign, @realDonaldTrump, but #lockhimup also has a nice ring to it seeing how he is speaking with Whitaker about an ongoing investigation concerning himself, #Trump, and his family. That is called, obstruction of justice.
@Jim_Jordan @LouDobbs Only someone that is being influenced by the Russians would claim that @TheDemocrats hate #Trump. That is an outright lie. The issue is that a wall does nothing to help the US. The money is being wasted and does not even cover the cost and upkeep of the wall. #sad #wrong
@CBSNews The majority of drugs pass through legal ports of entry than through the open borders. Same with trafficking. @realDonaldTrump is the most clueless person that has ever been born
@seanhannity It can’t be used. A bit fast on the texting
@seanhannity He can’t as there isn’t even enough support in the committee to even bring it to a vote. That’s why the nuclear option can be used. There is more opposition to the funding than support even if it is brought to a floor vote.
@realDonaldTrump We do believe that the recordings can verify that you own the shutdown. #TrumpShutdown is what it is callled and that you own it.
@RepRatcliffe My mistake, not given, but give into.
@RepRatcliffe Why? Why would you given to a lunatic child sitting in the #WH? This wall is suppose to be paid for by Mexico, not the US. There is zero reason for this fence to be built. I can assure you that whomever runs against you, I, as a Texan, will fully support and donate to them.
@SenateGOP @POTUS The Stock Market has lost over 4,000 points in the last month. The LAST MONTH! That’s trillions of market loss. Not since the Great Depression has the market fallen as far. Unemployment has continued to fall from when #Obama was in office.
@realDonaldTrump You’re causing panic across the globe. Withdrawing is the wrong thing to do. It’s the US that is responsible for the rise of ISIS. We need to stay as wall withdraw will embolden them.
@realDonaldTrump Steel slats make a fence and not a wall. You’re a weak president and have no clue on what the, Art of the Deal, actually is.
@realDonaldTrump Actually, Russia, Iran and Turkey are all happy that you’re looking to withdraw from Syria and is ISIS. They’ve played you for the fool that you are. #sad #wrong

@GOP That’s just a drop in the bucket. (Intended) But seriously, that’s maybe .0001% of the drug caught crossing the border.
@realDonaldTrump You also can't win on the wall when you've lost the House. They will not pay for the wall and you will be blamed for any and every shutdown.
@realDonaldTrump What's been wasted is the nearly $6 trillion dollars in the Middle East war all because W. and Cheney lied about #WMD and a personal vendetta W. with Saddam. We out spend the next 9 countries on military spending. Billions wasted on contracts to cronies of members of congress
@politico You can’t take appropriation funding from an agency that has already been designated for their spending. That’s illegal. And it’s still asking American taxpayers to fund the wall.
@BillOReilly Trump spends most of his day sitting in front of a tv watching Faux News. He’s so simple minded that it’s amazing and keeps him entertained.

@LouDobbs #smh really Lou? Daily Crap? All these #Russianbots seem to really love you and their replies are hilarious. I won't even click on that garbage. Their office followed protocol with the phones. Give it a break.

@CCN_News1st Forget about hemp for the moment. Why are you just sitting on your laurels just letting Trump to continue to lie about practically everything? That raid on Cohen's office was legal as a republican judge issued a warrant to the FBI to obtain his records. Is it because he's white?

@realDonaldTrump Hey there Mr. Happy Orange one. It seems that you have forgotten about the #1A and that you're a public figure. #sad #wrong Have a happy holiday in #Maralago during the shutdown not caring about some 300k federal workers no getting paid!
@realDonaldTrump They had subpoenas which the presented and they were allowed inside without any incident. That means, they "DID NOT" break into an attorney's office. #sad #wrong #smh
@realDonaldTrump Nixon said the same thing about the press before he was impeached.
@LouDobbs 🤣🤣🤣 Like they actually do work. They ain’t going to build it. If it isn’t funded by now, it’ll never be funded and #Drumpf owns it.
@realDonaldTrump Getting a bit scared that there will be a shutdown I take it? You said you own it. So if there is one, then you own it. If there is no wall funding, only you can avoid a shutdown by signing the bill authorizing government funding.
@LouDobbs @pnjaban @realDonaldTrump @CharlesHurt @POTUS But you never said the same thing when the @GOP relentlessly went after HIllary. In fact you were promoting a witch hunt against her. You don't get that option. You don't get to say to end the witch hunt until you admit that the one against her was wrong.
@politico They just can’t let go of the Clinton’s can they? They’ve been under some sort of investigation by the @gop since Bill got a BJ in the Oval. #sad #wrong pathetic. I guess they have to rush to get this in before next session since they won’t get to do it again
@VP @virgingalactic @POTUS They’ve been planning and designing this for years prior to the idiot that’s in office. He had nothing to do with their launch.
@realDonaldTrump 🙄 How is that so called brain of yours even keeping you alive?
@realDonaldTrump #USMCA is DoA. There is not enough support in either chambers to pass it and you CANNOT cancel #NAFTA, only congress can do that as it is foreign trade. The president has the ability to negotiate trade, but it MUST be approved and passed by congress.
@realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣🌊🌊🌊 You so funny. Damn funniest accunt that there is on #twitter So far everyone that has flipped is stating you were fully aware of the payments and that they were meant to protect your presidential run. Meaning that the payments ARE an illegal campaign contribution. 🖕
@GOP @senorrinhatch Should be term limits for members of congress just as there is for #POTUS. There is no reason for someone to hold office for that lng. It stalls innovation and progress. Most older members have zero clue on how technology works.
@realDonaldTrump The attacks are by French nationalists and not from immigrants. A border wall would not have stopped the attacks. You have no idea what you’re talking about.

@tedcruz Because #Trump was getting cranky as he hadn't had his six hours of Faux News and needed a nap. All the lights and noise was upsetting him too.
@BillOReilly Have you even read the transcripts of the interview? There are numerous questions that are irrelevant and that are about things after he left the office. He gave more information than #Trump can give moments after he’s been told something.
@realDonaldTrump Wait!! It’s now secure? Hallelujah!! Now we don’t need to spend any money on a border wall!! Praise be #Jebus...oh, we have more people with diseases and criminals that come here legally by plane and boats on visas than through the southern border. What about them?
@realDonaldTrump Uhm, people are still digging and climbing over the border wall. Its not stopping then and they are not going back https://t.co/G5yRKgC9Qr
@realDonaldTrump The military does not have the authority to fund or build the border wall.
@realDonaldTrump Well, mentality level, not age.
@realDonaldTrump Wait. Kids over ten are vying for a job in the #WH? It does make sense seeing as you need to be working with someone on your own own age and mentality level.
@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs Uhm, not really. Only your silly imps are crowing and jumping up and down flinging poo at everything that they can.
@seanhannity It's going to be thrown out as he doesn't have a claim.
@LindseyGrahamSC @seanhannity @FoxNews No
@HouseJudiciary The responses were to questions that he could not answer as he had already left the department. There is nothing wrong with the answers. Unlike #Trump that has repeatedly changed his answers and what he recalls.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump The U.S. added 2.2 million jobs in 2016, on top of 2.7 million jobs gained in 2015. There was growth of at least 2 million jobs in each of President Obama’s last six years in office, with 75 consecutive months of jobs growth. https://t.co/WzL0xtujtC The trend is continuing still.
@Heritage Seeing how there has been validated voter suppression, outright ballot theft, "NC-9", there are reasons to denounce certain elections. Trump himself stated he would not accept a loss of the election.

@realDonaldTrump @GeraldoRivera You're individual-1. There is an investigation going on and like your taxes being under an "audit," Mueller has no reason to release anything at this time.
@realDonaldTrump There is no cost for the Paris Agreement. Nothing will be returned to anyone. You have no clue whatsoever what you're doing as president and you just make things up all the time.
@realDonaldTrump There is no cost to the US taxpayer. Plus, Mueller stated about what has been spent, “within the approved budget,”. #Benghazi took over two years and Hillary spent more than eight hours answering questions. You just finger painted yours on paper, not in front of anyone.
@NRO And what about #lockherup? Baby man #Trump was saying that the whole time he was running. Even prior to receiving the nomination. So just shut the fuck up. Also, it's not a threat, it's just pointing out that they house can do so. #sad #wrong
@realDonaldTrump Uhm. They picked up one seat and held on to the ones that they had. I don't call that a really win. They also lost 40 seats in the house due to a blue tsunami. There's still seats up and they can flip to blue.
@DailyCaller And your man #Trump has don't the same, or really much worse? Daily Crap is what you should be calling yourself.
@realDonaldTrump Uhm no. You're considered to be individual-1. I don't get where you believe that this clears you.
@realDonaldTrump And let's get you on the stand and force you to answer questions under oath about colluding with Russia.
@realDonaldTrump Also, it's not "bye", but "by". #sad #wrong
@realDonaldTrump Mueller is a well respected prosecutor that has taken down many members of the mob. He is well respected veteran. He is a lifelong member of the GOP. He has never shown any partisan politics. Perhaps you feel that cold clammy hand on your shoulder? That hot breath on your neck?
@GregAbbott_TX And as far as big government goes, that’s what the state is. A big government that oversees smaller governments.
@GregAbbott_TX Let’s get a few things straight. It was not just Austin, but multiple jurisdictions that are opposed to the cap. School districts, counties and other cities. Caps limit the ability of these jurisdictions to keep funding and they will not be able to provide services if capped.
@LouDobbs @BreitbartNews Why do you keep supporting an outlet that has supported pedophiles, racists and white nationalist? Ratbart is known for sowing disinformation and hatred. The information that they posted is taken from other racist websites and cross posted to try and make it valid. It’s not valid
@realDonaldTrump No it doesn't. There is no valid proof that the US loses 250 billion a year. There is no way that it would only take two months to pay for the wall. You have no idea on economics and you didn't write, The Art of the Deal.
@realDonaldTrump Tariffs mean a tax on consumers. It means that consumers will be paying higher prices on products. It means that companies in the US that import from China pay higher prices. You seem to be just a mean bitter person that's really and truly unloved. #sad #wrong

@robertjeffress @realDonaldTrump It still has to pass a vote in congress and there aren't enough votes to pass it. It's DOA and there aren't any details on it. Even if it does pass the US house, it must be approved by each country's legislature and that could be months. Delays also possible due to revisions,
@nytimes Is this another dig at @realDonaldTrump? Perhaps it's a reference to the #HandmaidsTale and his treatment of her and other women? Naw, she's not that bright to come up with something like that. It just shows that she really doesn't care about anyone but her.
@LindseyGrahamSC They both have loaned and provided money to the Trump Family. They own them.
@seanhannity Most of the leaks are coming from the WH. Usually it's from #Trump's Depends when it hasn't been changed hourly.
@SenTedCruz @FreeBeacon I’d find them more favorable if they supported free bacon instead. You’re retweeting the original organization that prompted the #SteeleDossier. They’re a crap organization that is destroying the conservatives and the @gop. I take no issues with them boycotting #Israel.
@realDonaldTrump It’s apparent that you have no clue about how the economy or companies work. #sad
@realDonaldTrump So you’re saying that you want them to close more factories and lay-off more workers? Is that what you’re saying? Because that’s going to happen. You can threaten them all you want, but you can’t force them to keep the plants open. No president can. #smh #sad #wrong
@realDonaldTrump @60Minutes The photos from 2014 are those of children that came without their parents. They were not separated by the Obama Admin. The children are being seperated by your admin as your admin authorized the actual separation. #Sad #Wrong
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump And you have to be some sort of psychopath to agree that he hasn't promoted hate and bigotry. The woman he supports stated she wanted to see a hanging. I really feel sorry for those that believe that he is trying to help Americans.
@realDonaldTrump @cindyhydesmith Then why are companies and organizations demanding that their donations be returned? You support racist, bigots, peodphiles and killers. You're just a world class troll is all you are and your wife @FLOTUS @MELANIATRUMP doesn't care that you bully people. #BeBest
@DailyCaller @RickLeventhal @HillaryClinton @realannapaulina Naw. That's what Giuliani is. Worse than that, he's gonorrhea. Just non-stop stream from the butt.
@realDonaldTrump Still higher than it was under #Obama. In Texas, we had prices under $2 a gallon. I was able to fuel up my car for less than $20 a tank. Currently I’m paying close to $25 every time I fill up my car.
@seanhannity Mueller is playing with his cards close to his chest. You’ve seen more people connected to @realDonaldTrump plead and go to jail than any other president in the history of the US. Just because he hasn’t made any public announcements, doesn’t mean that there isn’t evidence.
RT @ABC: In a rare rebuke, Chief Justice John Roberts pushes back against Pres. Trump's criticism of a judge who ruled against the Trump ad…
@seanhannity Let’s hear from the #Trump charities whistleblowers. Let’s hear what they have to say about where that money went.
@realDonaldTrump @mgoodwin_nypost I don’t see the members of the democrats spewing lies and hatred.
@realDonaldTrump You do realize that these lower prices are causing US producers to scale back on their output as well. Also, slower production means people are going to be let go or furloughed.
@realDonaldTrump Who’s writing this shit? Because it certainly isn’t @POTUS. It’s much too clear and isn’t full of his usual ignorance.
@seanhannity Hey what about ivanka's emails? should we #LockHerUpIvanka #LockHerUp for doing what Hillary did? Come on, what do you have to say now that it's been said Ivanka did the same if not worse?

@JohnCornyn @politico Senator, just remember this, Cruz went from a 16% victory when he was first elected, to a margin of about 2%. True he's one if not the most hated senator even amongst peers, but a large number of read strongholds flipped blue. You may not be there after next election.
@ThisWeekABC @FLOTUS it's not that they are ridiculing you for speaking out, it's that they are critical that you're a hypocrite. Until you condemn what your husband @POTUS @realDonaldTrump says, cyberbullying and just plain bullying, your words are meaningless.
@JohnCornyn Can you say, Roy Moore who to this day has still not admitted defeat?
@GOP @BrianKempGA Congratulations to a racist that keeps the blackman down. That keeps him bound and from having a voice. Tell me and the rest of the world, how you can be proud of what he did? How you behind this account can live with yourself knowing that he stole and suppressed the vote?
@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump If a boat load of "white" europeans decided to come over to a port of entry in NYC or to Ellis Island, would you turn them away if they too were seeking asylum?
@GOP @KellyannePolls If they wanted to continue the president’s role, they’d have voted the House Red, but it’s turning #Blue and he’s running scared 😱
@RedState He’ll walk out of the press conference? 🤣🤣🤣🤣 That’s some funny sh*t. Make sure he takes his balls with hi m too.
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @RepCuellar In other words, you passed a fluff bill that really does nothing. Again, you may as well of lost this election as it was the closest margin in decades. Red counties are turning Blue. You’ll be out of office next election.
@BillOReilly https://t.co/wjbGx2jkE2
@SenTedCruz @tedcruz how is it that you only won the senate election by a narrow margin? The 2% is the lowest amount won by a Texas GOP candidate in decades. I can assure you that the next person that runs against you in the primary will have my full support and donation.
@ThisWeekABC They aren't headed to the wall or an area where there isn't a wall. They're headed to a legal port of entry and are applying for asylum as they are allowed to do per our laws.
@FaceTheNation @FLOTUS How can you @MELANIATRUMP justify not speaking out against what your husband, @potus @realDonaldTrump says? How do you stand by his side after he has cheated when you were pregnant? How can you allow his bullying to continue? I won't respect you until you #walkaway from him.
@SenTedCruz your marjon of victory over @RepBetoORourke was the smallest victory a #republican has won in a senate race in decades. Again, can you explain how you came close to losing this election? How hardcore red counties flipped blue?
@VP @POTUS He was afraid that his hair was going to get wet and show how bald he really is. He skipped out and lied about not being able to attend the memorial when other world leaders made the trip. If it was safe enough for them, then it was safe enough for chicken little to go.
@FoxNewsSunday @realDonaldTrump That's a shit load of makeup and one hell of a dye job on that flattop there.
@CNNTonight Wait. He's gained weight and doesn't look well? He's fat and looks like crap. Isn't that a given? He's never looked great except when he was all dolled up like a cheap $2 street walker. He's also fat. Fatter than Cartman and has a fat ass.
@senatemajldr Yes please walk through as Satan is waiting for you just the other side.
@LouDobbs I don't support either one's agenda. Both are evil.
@senatemajldr The question is, will you work with them or will you put partisan politics ahead of the country?
@ComicBookNOW But who's going to make all those cameos in Marvel movies now? 😢 RIP to the greatest Superhero there has ever been or will be.
@realDonaldTrump Uhm. They don't do diplomacy via tweets. I get you're trying to tell people about it, but this won't change a thing. Why not actually talk to them instead?
@SenTedCruz I'm still waiting to hear how you can explain the 14% loss difference from when you first won election to the senate. Care to answer? How is it that until #BetoForTexas ran, that there had been GOP strongholds where @TheDemocrats had no chance, but have flipped Blue?
@GOP @realDonaldTrump @BetoORourke  helped to flip 12 Texas House Seats Blue in Red strongholds. Two Central Texas that bleed Red turned Blue when it came to Beto and Cruz. That so called ripple is fine and just a start
@realDonaldTrump There's no proof that a large number of ballots have been forged. None whatsoever. Just because you have no concept of reality doesn't mean what you're saying in true. You didn't even decide who got fired on the Apprentice, that was the producers, and directors. Not you.
@Paul_Arsenault1 @VD0meras @With_a_Vim @ScottforFlorida No. The recount was stopped by #SCOTUS and they allowed Bush to be declared the winner of Florida.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Just this past summer, #Trump stated that we can't afford veterans healthcare without cuts. Had we not cut the taxes for the top 2%, we could definitely afford the care and housing. https://t.co/pXPrkEnSyJ
@realDonaldTrump BS. Irs over 19 million acres of land. It's nature and they can only cover so much ground.
@CBSNews It's the same with numerous other members of congress. Even @SpeakerRyan was sleeping in his office https://t.co/qkPH3eElTT		Same with other members https://t.co/sG5nUxP5aI
@SenTedCruz you only won the first time because of the Tea Party movement which was pushed by #Russianbots and Russian propaganda. You narrowly won. You're a loser and it's obvious.
@SenTedCruz because of your poor showing in Texas, Democrats took over both the Third and Fifth Court of Appeals. Your win was not a win for the @GOP. Can you explain how you can claim a victory when Texas is starting to turn blue? Strongholds are slipping an flipping.
@ScottforFlorida There's a recount that is going on. Until that recount is completed, there is no reason for him to concede. I bet you wouldn't concede if the roles were reversed. You'd be screaming bloody murder.
@SenateGOP @CNBC Millions of openings but still millions out of work, or having to work two, three or more jobs as many are low paying jobs.
@GOP Something something something #SCOTUS Bush, #Florida
@LouDobbs The forest cover some 30 million acres. Of which 19 million is managed. Care to explain how one can manage that large of an area? It’s nature. Nature does what it wants regardless of what man does.
@realDonaldTrump Concession is a gentleman thing to do. When things change as they have, then it’s ok to walk it back. Much like you have done on hundreds of occasions.
I can say that come next election, that you could very likely be going home. According to your wife, it’s just going to be one home as you don’t make enough money. Although she probably makes $500k working for Sachs. Making her the bread winner. Unless you have unreported income
@SenTedCruz again, how do you explain your loss of 14% from when you were first elected to office? You won by 16% at that time and this time, by just over 2% of the vote. And again, @RepBetoORourke helped to flip 12 Texas house seats Blue. Red counties are turning Blue too.
@realDonaldTrump It's a forest you fucking idiot. A FOREST! They cover some 30 million acres. How do you manage to even breath? We all know that you can't think. It's quite obvious to anyone that has the intelligence of a rock.
@SenTedCruz can you explain how you lost that 14% of the voters that voted for you in 2012? How A number of counties turned Blue that were hardcore Red #GOP strongholds.
@realDonaldTrump So a do over? That’s not how elections work, #dumbass why don’t we just redo the whole presidential election while we’re at it?
And furthermore, Hays County which has also been a GOP stronghold also turned BLUE! Face it, that 2% will be negative next time around no matter who you ryn against. https://t.co/uG29YMwgTA
@SenTedCruz just to reiterate how much you have lost since you were first elected. Williamson County which is a GOP stronghold, turned BLUE and voted for @RepBetoORourke. Again, a GOP stronghold turned blue. No one likes you. Just ask other senators https://t.co/bEWlEJGlmD

@ThisWeekABC And then the new House come January can start it back up again.
@ABC Then why are there what, 100’s of open positions and the highest turnover of any White House administration? I know I wouldn’t work there even if paid a million dollars.
@SenTedCruz just so you understand. @BetoORourke lost but still helped #Texas #Democrats to flip 12 seats. While they’re still behind, that’s a big change and you lost 14% from your last election
@tedcruz I don't think you get that while you won, you still lost. You took Texas by 16% on your first run, this time around it was by 2%. Some 225k votes. That should scare you because next time around, you could lose.
@FoxNews Impeachment? Let's get real. There is no chance of impeachment without having the senate unless the GOP get on board, So stop talking about impeachment.
@realDonaldTrump You lost the house and are now a lame duck president. Way to go.
@FoxNews And @realDonaldTrump had mocked the disabled and attacks the media relentlessly.
@BillOReilly What about the welfare payments to the 1% and to businesses. What about the tax cuts that Mitch is claiming we need to cut Medicare because that 1% of the budget will sure balance the budget. Cuts to SSN don’t go to the national budget. They stay with FISCA and are raided by @GOP
@RealSaavedra So he was volunteer for a political campaign. He did not represent or speak to the media for the campaign. I'm sure if one were to look at the people that volunteer for any political campaign, that there will be bad actors. So just drop that shit.
@GOP I can tell you that my financial position has nothing to do with #Trump. I started with a new company over four years ago and have moved up because of my hard work. Not because shitbag @realDonaldTrump is in office.
@thejasonhopkins Have you seen the Trump supporters at polling locations? Many are armed and intimidating minority voters. Hey I've an idea. Let's pull a Ronald Reagan to enact a new Mulford Act outlawing the carrying of a loaded weapon in public. It was specifically aimed at the Black Panthers
@realDonaldTrump What poll? There is no poll. You're just squatting down and pulling shit out of your ass. If there was a poll, you'd of linked to it.
@HouseGOP This job grow and economy started because of #Obama. He took the stagnant economy that was handed it to him blew it out of the water. Unemployment went down to 4.1 when he left office. It's still down despite Trump. But wages are down and people are working multiple jobs now.
Let's NOT #WalkAwayFromDemocrats but #walkawayfromGOP to #WalkAwayDemocrats2018 is completely stupid and these are being fed by #Russianbots
@NBCNews The troops are a waste of money. They cannot arrest them. They cannot detain them nor touch them. All they can do is just watch them and contact the border patrol. BUT, the caravan is planning on arriving at a legal point of entry per law. They're not planning to cross illegally.
@tedcruz Newest polls show that you're now tied or actually starting to fall behind with those that are most likely to vote by 2%
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Bill Clinton grew the economy. W. Bush was there for a crash. Obama grew the economy and was cutting the deficit. Trump's numbers lag behind Obama's but he's still benefiting from what he inherited from Obama. The economy is slowing and the market has started to fall again.
@SpeakerRyan The @gop is stuck in the 80s with the belief of #Voodooeconomics #trickledown #reaganomics. Giving tax breaks to the wealthy allows to stash more money away. That doesn’t help the economy. Providing tax breaks to the middle class allows more purchasing power &amp; helps economically
@HouseGOP Fake news. The job reports during #Obama’s time in office were made up according to you and he rest of the @GOP. Well guess what, if those numbers were fake, then these numbers are also fake.
@BillOReilly Actually, I don’t even watch him. In fact, Mr. Trump is a loser and isn’t even the one in charge. Much like the reality show he was on, there are people behind the scenes pulling the strings. He still thinks he’s on a tv show reading a script.
@drmistercody @tedcruz This a good question that deserves to be answered. Let’s hear your response, Ted.
@tedcruz Ted, this caravan is planning to present themselves at a proper port of entry to the US. They aren’t planning on crossing in illegally. Let’s not muddle what is happening. They’re also months out for crossing the border. There’s no reason for military to be there.
@LouDobbs @POTUS @realDonaldTrump And these types of polls are always skewed based on followers.
@LouDobbs So that means that you fully agree that #Flotus parents shouldn’t have been allowed citizenship based on Melania? Wow. Let’s let @POTUS @realDonaldTrump know that you support detaining and deporting them from the US. That I can also agree with.
@tedcruz And your FATHER fought for Fidel Castro who allowed Russia to set up missiles in Cuba. I’d say that he too is a communist.
@SpeakerRyan Lets take out the wages and salaries of the heads of companies and just focus on those at the bottom or the middle and we’ll see that their wages are flat. Including their wages skews that percentage a hell of a lot.
@GregAbbott_TX Texas has seas of blue through out it. Especially in the Heart of Texas.
@FoxNews @POTUS This is just smoke and mirrors. Ignore it as he knows that he cannot do this as his advisors have made him aware. Stop talking about it. He’s trying to get the @gop elected by any means that he can.
@SenateGOP I'm lucky enough not to have to work multiple jobs, but I've talked to many people who have to work 2-4 jobs as the ones they work don't pay enough. Plus, the rate of unemployment started dropping under #Obama.
@MacGyve48755890 @Su19712Su1971 @CarlyELehwald @realDonaldTrump Nope. You're wrong. There are 39 countries that grant citizenship to people born in that country, with the exception of diplomates. You must not have looked that hard. https://t.co/Adlnu9CkNi
@SenateGOP Healthcare is increasing. Gas is up. The cost of groceries have gone up. These have gone up even more than the additional $5 - $10 a week a person may be getting. A bigger paycheck does not mean a person is better off when everything is going up in price.
@Randy63533408 @BadHombreMarcoB @ByTheBaySF @dpmoran1962 @marthagaustad @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson If it is to changed then it must be amended by 2/3 of both houses of congress and then approved by 3/4 of the states. That's the only way it can be changed since it's the 14th amendment. I don't see that happening anytime soon.
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS This was just a photo op, much like his visit to LA when they were recovering from the floods. In fact @BarackObama was asked to hold off his vist by the Gov until the state could recover enough to have him visit. The families, and politicians did not want #Trump there.
@FoxNews @POTUS Sorry, but a president cannot EO any of the amendments. That not only takes an act of Congress, it also takes a national vote. This is just pure BS for the stupid #Deplorables that think #Trump is their god.
@realDonaldTrump Also, the US military has NO authority to detain or arrest them per US law.
@realDonaldTrump They are going through the legal process by presenting themselves at a legal point of entry and seeking asylum. That’s how asylum works.
@LouDobbs Let me further dispel those of you claiming you can do so at a embassy. You cannot apply at an embassy. You can ONLY apply at the US border or point of entry. 		https://t.co/3ABIhrzc6F
@LouDobbs You're posting tweets from a propaganda machine that is known for for supporting nazis and pedos. You're promoting hatred and violence. They are refugees. They have a right to come to a port of entry apply for asylum.
My advice to Ky employees @trane #Traneclosing #Trane is to find a job and leave now. They have no need for you as they're shutting and there's no reason for any of you to stay. They have busted your union and are moving to a non-union plant to get away with more.
@LouDobbs @SaraCarterDC @realDonaldTrump The military has no authority to arrest or detain ANYONE crossing the border. In fact, they cannot by federal law, be armed. All they can do is to report anyone crossing the border to the Border Patrol. THAT'S ALL THEY CAN DO.
@PressSec sarah sanders, the @POTUS is treating his term as if he's still on a reality show. He's inciting violence, and he's dividing and pitting the nation against each other much like they do on reality shows. I don't get how you can sleep at night knowing what you're doing.
@ChuckRossDC @DailyCaller Standard procedure for LEO to do. There's nothing wrong with it. How much were people paid when the @GOP was investigating #Hillary's emails? What did they offer to them in exchange for testimony?
@mollyfprince If you submitted your phone number on a sign up sheet at a rally, or on his website and you did not indicate that you wanted to opt out of text messages, you gave consent to receive the text messages. Unlike the text from the emergency alert system which no one can opt out of.
How can a man of faith, espouse the sale of weapons of war to any nation? None of the prophets who walked this earth, Jesus, Buda and such would say that profits from the sale of arms is valuable. The bible goes so far to tell of Jesus throwing the money changers from temples
Hey @FLOTUS @MELANIATRUMP, if you’d say you loved @realDonaldTrump just about once, maybe his heart would grow three times larger and he would #bebest and finally know the true touch of a woman’s love and heart. https://t.co/eLFk7KuzmN
@FLOTUS I’m not the one to say things about women, but you’re complete ignorance when it comes to sexual assault and saying evidence is needed is fucking disgusting. You’re stupidity is why the hell its not reported more. #trophywife #deportMelania #Trump
@tedcruz Even with a full house, you still HAVEN'T repealed the #PPACA #Obamacare. 70 plus attempts, and all are failures.
@tedcruz States have spent millions on drug test and less than a handful of people failed. There have been no savings. Fluff is a law giving Purple Hearts. That's the president's decision and job. Reagan signed SDI, that was a space missile defense program. Fluff, fluff fluff all of it.
@FoxNews @SenTedCruz Yeah, The @GOP didn't block any of @BarackObama's #SCOTUS picks. I mean, he was a lame duck &amp; it was an election year &amp; he really shouldn't of nominated Merrick Garland. That's what Mitchy said. It wasn't obstruction, it was keeping the black man in his place. Right. /s
@SenateGOP Can you tell us how a three day BS investigation was able to cover every facet of his background when you spent over three years on #Benghazi and two years on the emails?
@tedcruz Let’s just ban all hot air ~balloon rides~ and not worry about anything else. Like proper gun control measures and background checks.
@tedcruz An F rating means that he doesn't take bribes, or "donations" from them. You're one of the top ones. They don't rate on protecting the 2A, just on who takes their money. You're an A+ being one of the largest recipients
@HouseGOP You are quite aware that @BarackObama wanted to fix out infrastructure and you could have worked with him while he was in office to fix it, right? Well apparently, you must of forgot the @GOP congressional members told him no, repeatedly.
@DailyCaller Hey! Where’s the boob picture at? You showed a picture of her cleavage but the tweet doesn’t. Bastards...

@LouDobbs Well, he could jus #WalkAway and end this all. In fact, I hear many members of the #GOP are doing just that. #Kavanaugh polling shows that he is the least liked #SCOTUS pick in decades.
@FoxNewsSunday @SecPompeo That's ignorant. There are no winners in a trade war. The biggest losers are consumers as they are the ones having to pay higher prices for products imported. In fact, Wal Mart is saying that they'll have to raise prices. https://t.co/nrZ1ljtGtN
@11thHour @matthewamiller Oh @seanhannity. Do you think that #Trump will actually listen to you this time? He's a complete idiot, which is an insult to real idiots around the world. Unless you were using puppets or simple crayon drawings, the odds of him listening to you are slim to none.
Bots are posting &gt;&gt;READ THIS --&gt; This November, we have a clear choice between left and right, and I look forward to voting for @tedcruz: https://t.co/Snd57qR0Q2 … I #ChooseCruz for #TXSen! #TXSenateDebate &lt;&lt; Vote for @BetoORourke
It appears bots are working hard posting this &gt;&gt; I #ChooseCruz because I believe hard-working Texans and Americans should be able to keep more of the money they earn. @TedCruz lowered our taxes. @betoorourke will raise taxes. #TXSen #TXSenateDebate &lt;&lt; Vote @BetoORourke
@tedcruz Sir. I am in favor of decriminalizing ALL drugs. They should be regulated and the government should set up safe houses not just for the drugs, but for helping people to recover and get off of them too.
@realDonaldTrump The majority of sexual assaults are never reported as the person is embarrassed, frightened and fears being shamed by others. This includes both men and women. Some victims feel that it’s their fault that they were assaulted.
@tedcruz The Freebeacon is originator of the Steele Dossier. They were the ones first paid for it.
@nytimes It wasn’t a coffee shop. It was a #Whataburger where he probably bought her a kids chicken tender meal and extra ketchup on his burger. No mustard or mayo.
@tedcruz I’ve already donated $10 to Beto and plan to donate at least $200 more. I’ll also be going to the concert that Willie Nelson is having for him and donating there too!
Trump won't be able to complain about the Mueller probe's cost anymore. Hey ⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩ , guess what? It looks like your boy Manafort is about to cover the cost of this investigation, isn’t that great? https://t.co/ou9VJfpREO
@tedcruz You voted against EVERY veterans bill while @BarackObama held office. You vote over 95% along party lines. You continuously tried to repeal #PPACA #Obamacare while he held office knowing that it was never going to be repealed just to waste millions of taxpayers dollars.
@tedcruz Breitfart? Really? That piece of shit? You do realize that they supported a pedophile and rapist, right? So your retweeting them means you must also support pedos and rapist. You also voted against EVERY veterans bill while @BarackObama held office.
@realDonaldTrump How about we never forget that after the towers fell, you bragged that you know had the tallest building in downtown Manhattan.
@tedcruz I've yet to see a yard sign, or anything in support of you where I live. No one likes you. I've seen at least 100 yard signs for @RepBetoORourke and I can see one every time I look out my window and walk out my front door. It's been the best $10 I've spent so far this year.
@GOP Unlike Mitch who clearly stole @BarackObama's #SCOTUS pick.
@tedcruz Let #Israel burn. Keep the money here in the states where it is needed most.
@realDonaldTrump The reason for record lows, is that people have stopped looking for jobs. People have run out of unemployment. People have settled for a one, two or three low paying jobs. Wages are flat. and so is your deflated willy. #ImpeachTrumpNow
@tedcruz We #Texans #ChooseBeto @BetoORourke

@FoxNews And yet when he took that first step on the moon, Armstrong did not mention, America. "That's one small step for a man, one  giant leap for all mankind," is what he said. He didn't view the moon landing as being limited to America, but to everyone and country.
@marcorubio Even when he landed and stepped off the lander, he never mentioned America. He stated, ""That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind." He didn't see the landing as an American achievement, but an achievement for mankind itself. Plus, he NEVER mentioned the UN.
@tedcruz Fuck no. I donated $10 to @RepBetoORourke @BetoORourke as he actually seems more like the type of candidate that I'd sit and have a beer with. Eating at #Whataburger, skateboarding, being in a punk band, and coming off being cool.
@DailyCaller It hasn't been debunked. There are other sources that have confirmed it.
@realDonaldTrump Respect? Sympathies? With the names that you called him. The fact that you never mentioned this name on a bill that had his NAME on it, your sympathies and respect are meaningless.

@PressSec @realDonaldTrump Bullshit. This has been ongoing for 13 years. Trump had nothing to do with it.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump The federal government racked up a $76.9 billion deficit in July. Jobless claims are down as people have reached their limit and no longer counted. Many have stopped looking for work.

@JECRepublicans #CBO expects @realDonaldTrump to add $1.9 trillion to the debt.
@SpeakerRyan The job market is a continuation of what started under @BarackObama. The tax is not helping. May sales were down and the consumer index prices are up 2.9% in June. The economy is starting to falter. Wages are down and insurance is rising.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Stand up for them? Carrier has closed. Harley is moving out of the country. Auto mfg are planning to shut down lines due to tariffs taking affect. Some 23k solar jobs are going to be lost. 100ks of thousands of retail lost. The economy is slowing and faltering. So come again?
@thinkprogress Uhm, the handshake was just to agree to talk about denuclearizing. What he signed had nothing to do with actually doing it. He's a horrible person at working any sort of art of deal. He didn't even write the book. He had ghostwriters do it and he slapped his name on it.

@GovMikeHuckabee It took eight months and 50 sessions before the #PPACA #Obamacare was passed. Again, 50 sessions. Meaning that it was thoroughly combed through and revised multiple times before it passed.
@realDonaldTrump @PeteHegseth @FoxNews The #SteeleDossier was first funded and started by the #FreeBeacon which is an ultra conservative organization. They started it to keep you from being elected. The dems may have come in later, but they never started it. And no, at no time has anything been deemed ILLEGAL.
@JohnCornyn By handing off certain cases to states, it ensures that the parties being prosecuted cannot be pardoned by a presidential pardon. Presidential pardons are only for federal crimes and not state crimes.
@RepKevinBrady I'd like to see where this data is coming from, because that clearly isn't true. https://t.co/IKkEHE0OYV

@tedcruz BART supports racism and pedos. That is clear as he supported Moore and employed Bannon. You retweeting clearly indicates that you have no problems with their racist views.
@realDonaldTrump I agree that our favorite president @BarackObama did nothing wrong. You on the other hand should have been impeached long ago. And, in NY, it’s one party consent when it comes to recording phone calls. So as Cohen was aware that the call was recorded, it’s NOT illegal. Idiot
@realDonaldTrump No it isn’t in their contract.
The number of #RussianBots pushing #WalkAway is just amazing. It has literally exploded with them.
Hey @seanhannity, those low income housing units you own, how long before you start to evict people and turn them into gentrified housing units where you can sell as high end condos or rent as high end apts? Be nice to rich in to make more money, right? This give you ideas? https://t.co/Uz7Sfql2y2
#walkaway To those that post what @TheDemocrats represented back in the 1880s, that was then. Now they fully support the minority establishment. This changed in the 1900s. It's now the @GOP that would be voting against the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments with their actions.
@FoxNews @LDAppell What sort of sexual fantasy does #FauxNews have for @HillaryClinton and is there an interventionist that can help them with it? They just can't let go of her. Same with @realDonaldTrump. He got a good look at her ass during the debates and he must really want it bad. #walkaway
@FoxNews @seanhannity Which has been validated. He still has over 100 subpoenas that have yet to be filled in. There are collaborators, and he has indicted and jailed more people than other special counsel has.
@FoxNews @seanhannity No. At this time there have been no #Americans indicted, but the investigation continues. IF there no further need to investigate, then he would have completed his investigation. #Trump himself called for #Russian help and they did. His son met with them in #TrumpTower

@RNCResearch BS. They have all denied that they made any agreement with him to increase spending. He's like George Costanza when he made a funny comment and said he's done for the day and out. He thinks that he's the guy and everyone thinks he's the guy. He's not. https://t.co/0vEcArXX6T

@FoxNews Until it is verified that the are actual remains of a US veteran, I won't believe it. They have sent remains of animals and their own citizens in the past.
@SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr Let's get real. had any of @TheDemocrats done even half of what @realDonaldTrump has done and the @GOP held both houses, the country would have been watching impeachment hearings long ago. You're weak and need to be voted out of office or resign now.
@FoxNews @KellyannePolls 🤣😂 Stop please, you’re killing us. Oh god how this is some funny shit. Push back?

@ScottWalker The 13k so called jobs include supply chains. Those jobs will not be paying the same as FCon will pay and not all the jobs will be in WI. How many commuters from other states too? The $4 billion will not be recovered for decades to come. There is no promise of benefits or jobs.
@FoxNews @foxandfriends Then why all the people pleading guilty and convictions? If there's nothing to hide, Julie, intended, should let @realDonaldTrump speak to Mueller.
@realDonaldTrump It hasn't. If you're not guilty, there shouldn't be any reason why you won't sit down to speak to Mueller. If you are guilty, then you are  proving it by every action you take, &amp; attacks towards the investigation. An innocent man has nothing to hide, unlike a guilty one.
@MRamji58 @VP The difference is that the 2014 are pictures are of unaccompanied children that were arriving at the border without their families. The pictures now are of children that arrived at the border with their families and were taken from their families. It's not the same
@realDonaldTrump Do you not know how the funding works for #NATO? All 29 countries must be in full compliance by 2024. Meaning that they still have six years to be in full compliance. And, the money is not paid to NATO. Have your mommy or daddy read this to you, #dumbass https://t.co/TZfV8MklWX

@GOP @realDonaldTrump I’ll have at minimum, three different forms to fill out when filing my taxes next year. Never mind the fact that I’ll be doing it electronically, it will still be multiple forms that need to be done.
@HouseGOP You said, forms. Not just a single card. What I’ve read, I’ll still have to fill out separate forms to itemize deductions. I had deductions of over $14k this past year which came out to more than the $12k for individuals that have been proposed. I can get screwed because changes
@GOP @realDonaldTrump 😂🤣😂🤣 By whom? It's fallen to record lows across the globe.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump These numbers are fake. They’re false. The real numbers are probably under 100k and unemployment is really around 40%.
@realDonaldTrump Had our election been based on the popular vote, you would not be in office. At no time in my life upon finding out about you and who you are, I have never respected you. You’re a petty and hateful piece of 💩 and you probably smell like it too.
@realDonaldTrump The only thing that you’re putting first is #WhitePrivilege #WhiteNationalism. You have zero respect for other races which you have proven time and time again. #AmericaFirst is a isolation concept and #TradeWars do not work. #ImpeachTrump
@FoxNewsInsider @RealCandaceO @foxandfriends Oh BS. Only an ignorant fool would believe that. The @GOP is doing nothing for the black community. Nothing. In fact, there are members that compared blacks to apes. White people calling cops on blacks for no reason at all.

@realDonaldTrump Not that you care. It is a federal crime to destroy official government records. According to #SeanSpicer, your previous #WhiteHousePressSecretary, your personal account is an extension of the White House and what you tweet is an official gov't record. So deleting it is a crime.

@politico No, that's not right. That is another outright lie. There are plenty of people that bought a HD who voted for someone else. @realDonaldTrump is a farce. His stupidity no longer amazes me, it makes me stare and wonder how this man's body knows how to breath and keep a heartbeat.
@seanhannity Lost so many advertisers that you're shilling crap like Rush and Jones have to? Let me just say this. https://t.co/MFl1jU6h76
@NBCNews They are ramping up their programs. The US has zero information on how big and how many facilities that they have. Kim played @realDonaldTrump into recognizing as a serious threat on the world stage. He legitimized Kim as a man of power. He lost the deal to Kim on day one.
@CBSNews Well crap! Why didn't anyone ever think of asking #Putin if #RussiaMeddled in the US election before? Ok folks, it's been settled. Nothing to see anymore. You can all go on to another issue. (walks away hanging his head in shame for not thinking of asking before.) https://t.co/ol9xb5glqK
@NBCNews SO, there's this "plan" to dismantle #NK nuclear program in a year and no one has sat down with them to even negotiate it? Why am I not surprised by this. The fact that they are ramping up work on their programs tells us that they have no plans to stop.
@nytimes So are they paying they coyotes to return their children to them, or  are they paying kidnappers to them? Because that's they're having to do. Pay to have their children to them when the US gov took them away and held them hostage.
@GregAbbott_TX Praying and believing in a "god" without taking action to follow his word, is a sin. Is it not? Comeo out to the rallies and speak of "god" and your passion for him and your willingness to support the movement. If you don't, then your words are meaningless and your faith is a lie
@GregAbbott_TX If there is a "god", then why are children being torn away from their families? Why are there so many homeless people that are in need of help? Why do countries continue to wage wars? Why haven't you stepped out and spoken at these rallies that happen across the street from you?

@SpeakerRyan However; since I e-file, I won't need to attach an additional form to it and then mail it in, but I will still need to fill it out.
@SpeakerRyan Sorry, but while it maybe smaller, to claim deductions that I will file for, I'll need to add an additional worksheet if I were to file a paper copy too. in fact, most people that itemize and claim deductions will need to do the same thing. Same goes for childcare credits.

@GOP Then let’s #ImpeachTrump and #Obama so that neither one can run for President again.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump What achievement? All that was signed was an agreement to sit down to sign an agreement to look into denuclearizing. There is nothing in the agreement that says that they have to disarm or tear down their program. #Sad #Wrong
I would call @realDonaldTrump a lying sack of shit, but that would be an insult to a lying sack of shit.
@SenTedCruz If the tax cuts for the 1% were never passed, then we wouldn't need to be cutting entitlement programs. This was done on purpose so that those programs would be targeted for cuts.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump But Trump stated that he can't issue an #EO to stop the forceful separation of families. So either he lied when he said that, or the EO that he just signed is illegal and can't be enforced.
@JohnCornyn There's no law that states that families must be separated. This is a policy put in place by the @realDonaldTrump admin. As been said repeatedly, the @GOP holds all offices and they are the ones that control policies. The children are hostages with guns to their head.
@HoustonChron @tedcruz is only doing this to try and stop @BetoORourke from winning. He wouldn't lift a finger if he was running unopposed.
@FoxNews @newtgingrich Huh? Trump is the one that is corrupt and breaking all sorts of laws as president yet the @GOP do nothing about it. https://t.co/vLXBNEuNWV
@FoxNews @IngrahamAngle And they spend less than that on kids from the US and the @GOP and @realDonaldTrump want to gut CHiP and other safety nets for children just for their own tax breaks.
@FoxNews @hogangidley45 There is no law that says they must be separated. This is a policy that was just signed by Sessions for @realDonaldTrump to use as leverage in getting his wall that will not be built nor paid for by Mexico.
With the mass exodus of Fed employees, @realDonaldTrump is slowly achieving what he wants. To be #DictatorTrump. Once a department can no longer do its job, he can claim that he will do it and try to eliminate that department. This @GOP will let him rather than do anything.
@AP And? they did the same at the Olympics this year and years past. It's not any sort of breaking news.
@FoxNews @GovMikeHuckabee There are zero incentives and there is nothing that allows any country to inspect the progress of "denuclearization" of NK. Unlike the terms for Iran were inspectors had full access to all nuclear locations.
@FoxNews @Mark_Penn So, a republican that was assigned to do an investigation of a republican president, by another republican that was hired by the very republican president that the investigation is concerning is biased? Based on a report started by an ultra conservative organization. /smh
@realDonaldTrump Sessions is the one who announced that children are to be separated from their families. This is your admin and the @GOP controls congress. The lies you continue to make only fool your base of racist.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump There is nothing in the so called agreement that allows inspectors into the facilities and there is nothing to stop them from continuing their goal. There are only 4 points to it. And they are all about "working together." Nothing more. @realDonaldTrump got taken for a con job.
@FoxNews I'm sure that there are roads in that area that need to be repaired and upgraded.

@FLOTUS If you've got a secret divorce from @realDonaldTrump, you can signal everyone by staying hidden. America would understand if you did. If you haven't, go to Camp David with him and show everyone by holding his hand and giving him a long kiss without being reprepulsed

@realDonaldTrump When will you stop taking golf trips at the expense of taxpayers? Your golf trips have cost more than the investigation &amp; you've golfed more than any previous president in history. You've cost the American Taxpayer, an est $67,629,721 on trips to your own properties playing golf.
@FoxNews Blowsanne is a #racist and she has made these types of comments many times in the past.
@FoxNews They aren't. Trump has a spraypaint tan that is orange. He's white, not black. There is a long history of blacks being referred to as being racist. There were times when white actors wore blackface with white lips. There are drawings of black people as apes and monkeys. #Racist
@FoxNews There have been 29 officers killed by guns in the line of duty.	https://t.co/xXvlovDxh5
@SenateGOP I still talk to people where I work that can't find a job. That have a job that doesn't pay their bills. That have to work two or three jobs to try to pay their expenses. How many of those so called jobs are second and third jobs for some people? #JobsReport
@CNNSitRoom @barbarastarrcnn Anyone that think that NK is denuclearizing is complete idiot. We can look at @realDonaldTrump to see that. They won't give up their efforts and the @POTUS doesn't have enough cognition to understand that.
@JohnCornyn @FreeBeacon You’re retweeting from the website that paid to start the Steele Dossier. They are the ones that started the downfall of the US with the election of @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump Why hasn't congress #impeached you yet for not only the horrible language that you use, but for clearly violating the #EmolumentsClause of Article I, Section 9. The constant lying and criminal activity? Oh that's right, they don't care so long as they have an R in the #WH.
@realDonaldTrump Why do you keep repeating yourself? Just because you say the same thing over and over again doesn't make it true. The investigation is headed up by a #Republican, who was asked to check into it by a republican that YOU appointed.
@FoxNews @FLOTUS She didn’t tweet. Her staff did. She has not been seen so since she went into the hospital.
@FoxNews Then Tim Tebow should also be asked to leave the country for when he kneeled during the National Anthem. Why was it ok for him to kneel and not Kaepernick? One kneeled against abortion and the other for civil rights.

@FoxNews @GordonGChang @POTUS #Obama also secured the release of prisoners from NK.	https://t.co/jkeJdhzaf0
@GOP @realDonaldTrump @GOPLeader And yet, @POTUS sought to slash 95% of the funding for drug crisis. 	https://t.co/XZ8fVlw6tP
@GOP Let them burn. Let them fall. Defund them now. There is no reason for us to send money there when it is needed much more at home. There will be no second coming even with the move of the embassy, which is what many christian cultist believe.
@DailyCaller @realDonaldTrump won and has repeatedly slammed #Obama at least 100 times. At minimum. #Trump has also done the same to #Hillary and anyone else he's afraid of.
@realDonaldTrump This investigation was started by and is headed by members of the #Republican party. The Steele Dossier was funded by an alt right organization called, Free Beacon, all because they opposed you for the @GOP pick. The only thing rigged is you.
@realDonaldTrump They've been doing this for 31 years just to let you know. It has nothing to do with you being president.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats He accused them of his own policy of splitting up families. This is his administration that enacted the policy on his watch. He just threw #MS13 in their to deflect the blame.
I hate saying this about @FLOTUS @MELANIATRUMP, but I give her 1 or 2 more years with @realDonaldTrump since she's about to turn 50 SOON™. After that, he'll find someone other woman that looks like his daughter, Ivanka, to marry.
@realDonaldTrump WTF are you talking about? You should really stop hitting those white lines and bottles. Also, put the pipe down and get some rehab. Maybe the country can sit down with you and an interventionist to help you talk about your addiction.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats Well then, since the @GOP and @potus control congress, they can stop this horrible abuse and keep family together. 😂Who am I kidding. They're the ones in office and they won't do anything to stop what this administration is doing. Sessions is the one that ordered it.
@FoxNews Not clicking on any #FauxNews, but that’s just stupid. They’re just greedy and found a lawyer that will do anything to make money.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump It’s up 3% and you think that’s good? That’s about $600 for the entire year for someone making about $21k a year or maybe $52 a month. That might buy someone two, maybe three bags of groceries if they’re lucky.
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes Their stock is up and so are their subscribers. How can a failing company be failing when they’re doing better than they were?
@FoxNews For what? A camp out? They have no weapons and have no authority to detain anyone that they see crossing the border. They can only report them.
@FoxNews And? The school has a policy for graduation and all students must adhere to that policy. How would people like it if someone was to try and wear a sash for some other organization? Let her wear it, and then it opens the door to anyone else wanting to wear their sash.

@CNN There have been school shootings since the 1800s. https://t.co/DXZgqyU3bX I would suspect that there has been school violence even before that.
@FoxNews 😂😂 When has Giuliani ever been right? He keeps walking things back and #Trump says that he doesn't know everything.
@FoxNews Giuliani is delusional. Mueller has not now, nor will he tell anyone that is not part of the investigation team his plans. Guili was hired for his deception. He is responsible for not supplying #NYFD with radios that would have worked in the #WTC.
@FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump He approached it from fear and the stupidity of his base. That's what he did. People see him as a reality star and think that he actually made the decisions on the show. That was not ever the case. His base is stupid and that's what he counts on.
@HouseGOP Unemployment peeked to about 10% after Obama took office and dropped to around 4.7 when he left and it was continuing to fall. The current rate was achieved due to Obama setting employment in motion.
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump No, this is what collusion looks like. https://t.co/FY4YnYkCit
@realDonaldTrump No. At no point in time has Mueller ever said that there is no findings of collusion. It's only the people that are close to you that have said that to keep you calm. No president has ever demanded the DoJ and FBI to investigate themselves. NEVER!
@realDonaldTrump Running scared, aren't you? You know you're guilty of colluding with the Russians. You know Mueller is going to indict you. Turn yourself in. Give up. You're a loser and have small hands.  You know that you're the one that but Melania in the hospital. It's your fault. All of it.
@FoxNews @KenPaxtonTX No, it's not about culture, video games or music. There have been school shootings for decades. We hear more about them as we have 24 hr news and nation wide reporting. Simply read up on school shootings and you can see them even in the 1800s and1900s  https://t.co/DXZgqyU3bX
@realDonaldTrump @VP Can you post a new and current photo of @FLOTUS @MELANIATRUMP so we can see that she’s still alive and is doing well? We’ve seen that you tend to exaggerate things from time to time.
@GovAbbott @GovAbbott How many more times will flags be lowered to half staff before you take action on gun control? How many more students will lose their life because you failed to take action on gun control? Gun control does not take away a person's guns, but controls who can get one.
The @NRA no longer represents the us. It's a organization that represents the gun mfg. It no longer cares who can get a gun and lost its message long ago. Their money is tainted with blood and should be given back.
Let's get one thing straight #schoolshootings @POTUS  @GregAbbott_TX @DanPatrick @KenPaxtonTX @abcnews @MSNBC @FoxNews @cnn @SenTedCruz @NBCNews @nytimes Prayers are not going to form a magical barrier around a school. Proper gun control can help. Stop praying and take action
@SenTedCruz Screw you and your meaningless prayers. In case you haven't realized, prayers have done nothing to stop shootings such as this. Take action on gun control. Not gun seizure, but control.  How come your "god" allows this to continue? Can't pray it away.
@GregAbbott_TX Sir, I don’t want to hear about prayers. You can tell that to the parents directly. You need to work on addressing proper gun control. Not confiscation. But better background checks.
@realDonaldTrump You have no plans to bring the debate of gun control to congress. Screw you. Prayers do NOTHING to solve this. You have no concept of what to do. Gun control does not mean taking away guns. It means doing proper background checks when someone buys a gun.
Who we kidding, the people claiming that they #WasVotedMostLikelyTo do anything were ignored in school. Just like me!! 🤕
@realDonaldTrump The @GOP spent 4 years investigating Benghazi and the email took over 2 years as well. Just because they haven't released any findings, doesn't mean that they haven't found anything yet. A good poker player doesn't reveal their cards or send any tells until it's time. #Dumbass
@SpeakerRyan There people that worked in the coal industry that refuse to learn a new skill as the have the false belief and hope that those jobs will be back. They won't as companies are moving away from coal. It's a dyeing industry.
@SpeakerRyan Just because there may be open jobs for every person doesn't mean that someone qualifies for that position. There are many jobs that are open that people need to have technical skills to do. you can't expect a person off the street to work on a/c units without proper training.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Why is the #GOP using a redirect that goes through Cameroon? Is there  a money haven there that @POTUS is using?
@netanyahu @realDonaldTrump Let Israel fall and the US stop funding a disease in the Middle East.

@glennbeck @DICKS I don't care one way or the other. If they have a better price on an item I need, I'll buy it from them. Those that are boycotting them who blasted people that stopped going to #Chickfila have zero room complain if they are called idiots or worse.
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Let Israel fall. Just as other countries, the US has no business sending our money to them when it can be better used at home.
@FoxNews Let Israel fall. Take away any money that we are giving to them. This move is doing more harm than good for the region.
@SenateGOP @CNBC Job openings are meaningless if there isn't anyone qualified or skilled to do the job. How many of these jobs are low skilled and low pay? There are still millions without jobs and many lack the ability to work said jobs. A parent that can't afford childcare finds it hard to work
@foxandfriends No, that's not what it says,. It states that EU members could withdraw THEIR ambassadors from the United States. Simply #Fauxnews spewing one Fake News report after another.  https://t.co/PU1N8Ofdx0

@FoxNews @KamalaHarris @POTUS No. It's never truly worked. Anyone that believes that it has is has encountered an ID10T error.
@GOP She has attempted to with draw her name as she knows that she's not qualified yet she is not being allowed to do so.
@ThisWeekABC The Cyberbullying book she "released" is a copy of what was released under #Obama. #sad #wrong So unoriginal.
@GOP @FLOTUS She just plagiarized and copied a Cyberbullying booklet from when Obama was in office. #Sad #wrong Can't she come up with something original? Like filing for divorce from @realDonaldTrump? Oh wait, his first two wives did that already. Wouldn't be original, but still a good idea
@realDonaldTrump NO. That's not correct. The @GOP released their version of their findings, but @TheDemocrats and some other gop members are saying that that wasn't the full report. There is findings of collusion it's being covered as the #GOP is desperate to maintain power before fall elections.
@HouseGOP Passing out of the committee is one thing. Having quality bills that also pass through the senate and are signed into law are another. Bills that rename a post office and fake "National Day of" are meaningless.
@realDonaldTrump Yes it did. Giuliani stated that she was paid to make the issue disappear of the radar of the campaign. While no "money" from the "campaign" was, it was still a payment made during the campaign to keep it quiet. That then is considered a campaign contribution. An illegal one too.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump The majority of the founders were atheist, and deist. Some were religious and some agnostics. The US was not founded on religion and many of the forefathers even stated that the US was not founded on religion. Hence why there is no mention of "God", just the creator.
@ABC @realDonaldTrump In fact, I've had to use a lawyer and I never had to pay a monthly retainer..
@ABC That's one hell of a retainer. Strange how it matches the exact amount that Cohen paid her... 🤥🤥 @realDonaldTrump
Shouldn't everyday be #NationalDayOfPrayer with the idiot @POTUS that we have in office?
@DailyCaller That's right, Ivanka is daddy's play toy, so hands off of her. Why else would he compare her to other sexy women?
@FoxNews @seanhannity What? 2 or 3 hours? That's not even enough time to ask him about the pee pee tapes. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump will be subpoenaed in front of a grand jury and there will be no lawyers allowed in with him. He'll purger himself for sure when that happens.
@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Rogue? He's a registered member of the @GOP. He's methodical in what he is doing. Either he has something or doesn't. We don't know until he's completed his task and makes an announcement.
@seanhannity Admit it. You have a chubby for #Hillary, don’t you? Why else would you keep bringing her up when she has zero plans to run again.
@realDonaldTrump Talking to oneself is a sign of insanity or senility. If you ask me, I’d say it’s the first and then the latter mixed in for a kicker.
@LouDobbs @GOP Also, they cannot go to court to stop the investigation as it can only be stopped by the Justice department.
@LouDobbs Mueller is a registered republican and so are the majority of the people on his team. He was appointed by a republican who got permission from a republican judge to from the investigation. This was started by members of the @GOP. #Obama was not in office when this started.
Hey @seanhannity how much longer until your BFF @realDonaldTrump ask you to attack Michael Cohen? Any hints on what you’re planning to say if he flips?
@GOP No. What is. A fairytale is the @GOP staying that there was no collusion. They know that there is but they’re hiding it from the public because they’re drunk on power.
@HouseGOP Seen zero change in my utility bill. My pay hasn't changed and I had to adjust my deductions to make sure that the correct amount is deducted for income tax.
@GOP BS. the claim is that people are getting an average of $2k more a year. That isn't enough to make a difference in a down payment for a house and might cover a month and a half of rent or a mortgage.
@NBCNews The majority of staff at Mar a Lago resort are here on H-2B visas. In fact, they asked for even more than before because, They don't have any US citizens applying for jobs. If they paid a living wage and advertise for more than a single day, then they'd have more apply.
@HouseGOP A small business owner generally won't give any bonus, or increase what they  pay employees. They'll use it to try and stay afloat paying down debt and creditors.
@GOP Bad policy is allowing @POTUS to continually lie and get away with it. He was of @TheDemocrats and a #GOP controlled congress, impeachment proceedings would have already been started. You and the rest of the party are complacent and don't give a fuck so long as you're in control.
@ABC No. What has brought them to the table is that they destroyed their underground testing site. China has confirmed that it collapsed after a test. No secret test site means no more secret test. But, they have gathered a ton of data and still have secret sites that they'll keep.
I'm completely clueless as to who Michelle Wolf is. What's more, I don't care who she is. So she came across asa offensive and disgusting. She seems to have a lot in come with @realDonaldTrump in that they are offensive and disgusting to other people.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Yeah, because you're afraid of a real news network. Why not go on Morning Joe, or Maddow? #FauxNews is an entertainment channel that competes with #ESPN. #Chicken Great big #Phony. You don't have any balls to go on air without your handlers. bwack bwack. #CHICKEN!!!
@GOP Then take him to court and file charges. You won’t because it’s almost all true and if they get @realDonaldTrump on the stand, he’ll purger himself.
Hey @seanhannity, how many condos are you going to be able convert from those low income properties once you start eviction on people who can’t afford the rent increase because asshat @SecretaryCarson is screwing over poor people in low income housing?
@NBCNews Trump won by 21 points. She won by only 6 points. That should worry the GOP especially since the area has Sun City and Village in it. Those are pretty much solid Republican, so a loss of 15 points is big.
@FoxNews @TomiLahren When police shoot a black person yet they don't shoot a white person for the exact same thing, then there is a issue. When an unarmed black man that is doing nothing but standing, doing what he is asked, and is then shot, there is a problem.
@RepMikeJohnson As a single person, my deductions were over $14k this last year because of mortgage interest and property taxes. That $12k for singles is less than what I have.
@realDonaldTrump There is no deal. They're playing you for the fool that you are. All they said was that they will no longer be "testing", not that they will be stopping all nuclear activity.
@realDonaldTrump What should have been done a long time ago, is the cotton eye joe. As far as NK? You're an idiot is all I say about that.
@politico I despise the man, but Obama didn't attend Nancy Reagan's and Bush didn't attend Lady Bird Johnson's. Reagan didn't attend Bess Truman's funeral. Presidents don't attend first lady funerals. First ladies do. That has been the normal protocol.
@realDonaldTrump You do realize that what was leaked was edited, right? Why would the @GOP leak the full memos knowing that it would be proven that you are colluding with the #Russians? You're as clueless as a Giuliani who thinks he'll get Mueller to shut down his investigation of you.
@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump @KeithRothfus You do realize that just because there is no mention of it in the memos doesn't mean that it isn't true, right? Comey was fired prior to doing a complete investigation. He states that, #Trump, demanded loyalty. That is NOT something a president should do to the the FBI director.
@realDonaldTrump That you're ignorant and have no idea what the difference between a council and a counsel is?

@GOP Sorry, but you cannot say that an entire nation loved and admired her. I for one didn’t and there are millions more that didn’t either.
@RedState And @realDonaldTrump own appointments approved and issued the subpoenas. All judges could that are appointed could be considered to have conflicts of interest when ruling for or against almost anyone brought before them. So could #SCOTUS on almost everything.
@realDonaldTrump You're in Florida to play golf during the week at your golf club. The PM Abe is just an excuse to do so.
@seanhannity And never revealed that on your show. That is a conflict of interest as you had ongoing talks with him. Did @FoxNews know? If they #FireHannnity as they were never told, it's their decision.
@seanhannity You don't have to receive an invoice to be asked to pay a personal loan, or give one to someone. You don't have to have an invoice if someone just happens to ask you if you can spare a couple of bucks for the week and tell them to keep it. You spoke to him repeatedly...
@GOP @KellyannePolls I'd like you to open the door at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave in DC and meet the man in the Oval office. Seems like he does the same thing.
@AP I'm saddened to hear that he has passed away. R.I.P. To a great magician, actor, and comic. 😢
@seanhannity You consulted with him repeatedly &amp; you failed to disclose this with @FoxNews. Regardless if there was no money exchanged, you still sought legal advice. Cohen is #Trump personal lawyer and for all we know, were given instructions on how to back him. That’s illegal w/o disclosure

@FoxNews @foxnewspolitics Hey #FauxNews, can you tell us if @realDonaldTrump has gone golfing after striking #Syria? I mean after all, #Trump has been at one of his golf properties 106 times since taking office, in only 64 weeks. Meaning he's been at some twice a week.
@seanhannity Hey Hannity, has @realDonaldTrump learned this yet? He should of as he is on course to play more golf in just two years than @POTUS44 did his entire time in office.
@realDonaldTrump @GOP Your bombing of #Syria is a distraction for your actions with #Russia and the elections. This is not the doing of #Mueller. And guess what? These are not charges that can be pardoned by a president since they will be state charges.
@realDonaldTrump No it isn't. The information gathered was believed to be a lawyer committing a criminal offense. This was issued by your appointments, all members of the @GOP. A team of investigators that will remove anything that is Atty Client so not to taint the investigation. #SDNY
@CNN Nope. Mueller is still there and now so is #SDNY with their investigation that they started. They aren't going away anytime soon. Al-Assad is also still in power and he too isn't going away either. Nothing is accomplished.
@FoxNews No. #Russia sees him as a spoiled idiot child and they won't risk an actual war that no one will win.
@realDonaldTrump I meant, "Their" and not there.
@realDonaldTrump Your, I plan to strike Syria, days prior allowed them to move all there equipment to Russian bases. What happened to, I won't give away my plans? Seems like Liar in Chief is trying to distract from his obstruction and lies about Stormy.
@SpeakerRyan They were given time to evacuate and empty bases were struck since their equipment was moved to Russian air bases. And also, Stormy Daniels will bring down @realDonaldTrump which you should have already impeached him for obstruction.
@SpeakerRyan @ShopFloorNAM You’re celebrating a drop of 9,000 job less claims? That’s only about 180 per state. Again, it’s nothing.
@realDonaldTrump Except for the #Trumpfamily line of clothing. They will never be #MadeInTheUSA as its too costly.
@FoxNews @GeraldoRivera Apparently the investigators, a judge, an AG, all @GOP appointments, believed it was justified. It was not Mueller that issued or requested it, it was the #SDNY.
@ABC @GStephanopoulos Yes @realDonaldTrump you look like the type of guy that needs hookers and blow. Ones that you have to pay high amounts of money to as they won't touch you. Like that wife of yours. She wouldn't be allowing you to touch her if you weren't giving her money. And he's not your kid.
@SpeakerRyan As a single person that owns my own home, my itemization came out to over $14k this year with property taxes, mortgage interest and other deductions. I'd be losing over $2k in deductions with the new tax laws if I take the standard deduction.
@FoxNews Our constitution does not allow this to happen. Even Justice Scalia agreed that the US is an indissoluble nation. No state may be formed from another state, or states. White v Texas settled it too.
@NBCNews That's a baton, and not a baseball bat. That'll do nothing to stop a person with any sort of a gun.
@FoxNews @jasoninthehouse @foxandfriends We have a president willing to go to world war because he is trying to cover up for her personal life and the fact that he is a criminal. We have a president that is willing to let people in need of assistance starve to death and lose their housing for tax his own tax breaks.
@FoxNews @RandPaul This was not Mueller that conducted or requested the raid, This was the SDNY courts that issued the warrant and was requested by the NY AG. All Mueller did was turn over documents to them.
@realDonaldTrump We had a better relationship with them when #Obama was in office. It has only worsened since a babbling idiot reality star took office that has no concept of what it takes to run a country.
@FoxNews Neither the US military or national guard has the ability to arrest those crossing the borders. Furthermore, the president cannot deploy the US military within the US border.
@ABC Meh. It's just some #Trumper showing off a gun. I don't care if she shows it or not. The #2A is there for a reason.
@FoxNews @POTUS Over 60% of people that are undocumented have overstayed their visas. They mostly come by plane which a wall will not stop.
@nytimes #MAGA Mueller Ain’t Going Away and #Trump cant pardon state charges.
@FoxNews No it isn't. Cartels don't use the open borders for their big smuggling jobs. They use legal border crossings with drugs hidden in shipments. They use planes, boats and subs. Tunnels also play a part, but still not as big as the ones I mentioned.
@SpeakerRyan You and the rest of the @GOP blocked @BarackObama from striking Assad when he was in office. This blood is on your hands. Now, @realDonaldTrump criticized #Obama for wanting to do so and stated that he shouldn't as it would be bad to do so. Now he wants to do the same thing.
@LouDobbs @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Fuck Bart and their racist, xenophobic, homophobic, and sexist ideas. These trade wars kill jobs and increase cost to consumers.
@FoxNewsResearch And by you saying that it's the 90th consecutive month, you've provided that @BarackObama had continuous job growth while he was in office.
@FoxNewsResearch Job growth was expected to be at 193k. It's off by over 90k jobs. This could be the start of a recession if April's jobs are down too. So make it clear, it fell short by 90k jobs. That's not something to crow about.
@FoxNews @foxandfriends @BlackSheepDawg @UnhyphenAmerica @realDonaldTrump That's a lie, not once did anyone called Reagan, Bush Sr., or Bush Jr. a racist. However, the sitting @potus is a #Racist as can be seen in how he talks of minorities and his denial of selling housing to #AfricanAmericans when he was in charge of his father's properties.
@FoxNews @JonathanTurley Mueller isn't an idiot like @realDonaldTrump is. He's keeping his hand close to his chest and not revealing anything until the time is right. He has already issued multiple subpoenas and has convections. Only a fool would give away his tells.
Hey #Soybean farmers, looks like your president @POTUS @realDonaldTrump just screwed you royally. Just how much are you going to lose and rot in the fields now that there's a trade war with China that the US will not win?
@FoxNews @POTUS Furthermore, he cannot direct them to occupy the Mexican side of the border as that would be invading Mexico and that can only be done by declaring war, or them allowing with a treaty, to camp their side, which will never happen.
@FoxNews @POTUS He can send the NG, but he cannot deploy the US military to the border the 4th Amendment forbids the Feds from forcing private citizens to house the US Military. Since the border has many private land owners, they cannot force them to allow the military camp on the borders.
@FoxNews @PressSec @TheDemocrats offered on at least three different occasions what @realDonaldTrump wanted for #DACA. This is all on #Trump and no one else.
@FoxNews @POTUS Just like Bush and @BarackObama did. Can't do anything original except for lying.
@FoxNews @POTUS I'll say it again. The US military cannot conduct military operations with in the US border. The 4th Amendment forbids the US government to make private citizens house the military. These are all illegal actions against the constitution.
@FoxNews @POTUS The US military cannot conduct military operations with in the US border and the 4th Amendment forbids the government into forcing property owners to house the US military. The land along the US border is owned by private individuals. Unless you plan to suspend the Constitution
@GregAbbott_TX But how many of these are quality jobs? How many are second and third jobs for people? The quantity of jobs doesn’t matter as much as the quality of jobs. These could be minimum wage or low wage jobs that don’t pay people a living wage.

@FoxNews @marthamaccallum @realDonaldTrump was offered what he wanted for a #DACA deal and he actually was ok with it, but then later the same day, his handlers showed him a picture book, and explained where the bad illegals would touch him if he let them stay. So he changed his mind and said no deal.
@realDonaldTrump They provided you on multiple occasions deals on #DACA and you rejected them. They even gave you funding for the wall. This is your shit just like everything else. #sad #wrong #liarinchief
@realDonaldTrump Do you actually know that or are you regurgitating something from 2014 and are completely clueless as to what's in the actual contract that the #USPS has with @amazon? Parcel income is up due to shipping with them. #Sad #Wrong that you have no clue it's required to be profitable.
#IStandWithLaura to quit like the  loser that she is. Make it a permanent vacation. Stupid #RussianBots
@NRO Actually, he has to allow his client to consider a settlement. The fact is that he stated that they want the true story to come out. Meaning that there is not going to be a settlement. It’s lawyer speak is all that it is.
#HappyAprilFoolsEaster I guess it’s a sign. It must be just as everything else is a sign.
@realDonaldTrump What big flow of people? I’ve stated that it’s down to the lowest in 17 years. How’s there a big flow if it’s down? #ImpeachTrump
@FoxNews @POTUS ...That's a loss of over $5 billion dollars. Again, parcels, which is what Amazon sends, are up and are profitable. @realDonaldTrump has never written or reviewed a contract himself. It's always been his lawyers that write, review it, and then have him sign off. #sad so #wrong
@FoxNews @POTUS does realize the contracts are heavily reviewed and that #GAO has never mentioned that they are a "scam", right? Reports state their contracts are profitable. What is a scam is making the #USPS prepay for benefits for its employees. Mail is down 30%...
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine The majority of the founders were deist and held no real christian beliefs. Some were even atheist. Also, the US Constitution was based on the Magna Carta. There could have been some influence from the bible, but also from the Qur’an, and other religions.

@FoxNews People have done this for decades. So it's not something new that some people become groupies of felons. They did it to Manson, and other felons. People that do so are morbidly obsessed with them as they want to get closer to them.
@BillOReilly She didn't actually apologize. If you read what she said, She said that she was sorry someone's feelings got hurt. That's not an apology.
@FoxNews @POTUS No. The judge said that it was premature at this time. Key words, "PREMATURE AT THIS TIME." Meaning that she and her lawyer will still be able to depose @realDonaldTrump if and when it becomes necessary to do so. So just give it a bit more time for them to depose him.

@seanhannity The @GOP members are saying there was no collusion. @TheDemocrats have stated there is proof of collusion. You &amp; them are afraid of losing a patsy that's easily manipulated from the #WH that they don't care what he does. He just signed a #OSB that was a afraid to veto.
@FoxNews @POTUS Then why sign it? A real President would have the balls to veto such legislation and send it back. Shutdown be damned. A real president would take responsibility and ensure that his demands are included in the bill. Only a coward would just sign it to avoid embarrassment.
And it’s you’re not your.

@thinkprogress This Palin level stupidity. Wow. Just Wow.
@FoxNews @SpeakerRyan The @GOP was in control of the house and senate when @BarackObama was in office and presented him with the budget. The failure to fully fund the military is on him and the reset of the #GOP
@NBCNews Well, did they miss the one in #Austin? Because this is probably a case of being off the radar. A single individual working on their own from what can be told. Just how many more like him are there?
@GOP Trump hasn't even nominated half of the appointments. How can there be obstruction when there are no nominees? #ImpeachTrump It's like, how can you have any pudding if you don't eat yer meat?!

@PressSec @POTUS These are terrorist attacks and yet he has not called them that. Furthermore; it has taken almost 3 weeks for him to even mention them briefly. He's apparently not that concerned if it took that long.
@HouseGOP $139 million pales in comparison to the billions being paid as bonuses to ceo and other top members of companies.
@SenateMajLdr Actually, @BarackObama had a higher military spending than Bush did. Also, you and the @GOP were in charge of spending bills. So if they were underfunded, it's your fault that they were.	https://t.co/AYTJe0Nt3r
@ABC It’s been almost 3 weeks and he’s just now mentioning it? It took him less time to slam and discredit his staff then it did the bombings.
@FoxNews It cannot be done. The constitution prohibits any new states made from an existing state. And this WAS and still IS being pushed by #Russianbots. This is why #FauxNews was voted as the fake news channel. Wait, it's not a news channel, it's an entertainment channel.
@DailyCaller She doesn't seem to be afraid of @realDonaldTrump meaning that they believe that they have a good case against him. This is typical tactics where he threatens the person to make them back down. i don't see her or her lawyer doing that. Get him on the stand and call him out.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump @potus slashed the opioid program down to $17 mil from $300 mil. How is that fighting opioids? A wall does nothing as 90% of drugs come across through border check stations. #BigPharma is responsible for the opioid problem with over prescribing medication.
@FoxNews The property has been abandoned since 2011. No one has been living there. The Nuns are saying that they own it and the archdiocese say that they own it. They had no plans to live there. The dispute is between the nuns and the archdiocese. Read the article it came from.

@NRSC The reason unemployment held at 4.1% is due to the large about of layoffs and store closings. Also, how many were second jobs for people that are underpaid? how many quit looking for work, or just retired?
@SpeakerRyan Some 8k brick and mortar stores have closed laying off some 500k people in 2017 alone. An additional 5k stores are set to close so far this year. That doesn't seem like growth to me. That number can easily double since we're just half way through the first part of 2018.
@FoxNews @GOP @FBI @HillaryClinton So, do they plan on impeaching her? There's no point to this unless it's a #WitchHunt like someone else is trying to claim.
@HouseGOP @RepArrington In 14 months time, @realDonaldTrump has added over $1 trillion to the deficit and this is just the beginning. And you're right. The @GOP formula has not changed. It starts by sinking out country into debt and screwing the middle and lower classes.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Just because #Trumo has the memory of a wet rock, doesn't mean that other people can't listen and speak to someone, then later write it down.

@realDonaldTrump Why did the @GOP shut down their investigation when @TheDemocrats and some #republicans say that there is proof of collusion? and guess what, there IS proof of COLLUSION! See, I can make all capital letters too.

@JohnCornyn Regardless of who appointed him, that person has sworn an oath to uphold that office. Unlike @realDonaldTrump appointments, I have more faith on #Obama's appointments then #Trump's
@FoxNews He has not lied under oath. You're promoting falsehoods under a want to be dictator that wants to keep power like any other dictator. @potus has admitted on numerous occasions to lying. He has admitted he's a racist and a sexual predator. This is why you're called #FauxNews.

Many of these people rely on these benef as their pay doesn't stretch far enough anymore. Those that are seeing lower taxes are also paying higher premiums that wiped out the tax cuts.
@seanhannity It was funded and started first by the Free Beacon which is a conservative website. I repeat, a CONSERVATIVE website that paid for it.
@FoxNews What outrage? @POTUS is a vile person and they are showing what he really is. The man is a racist and a sexual predator that attacks women’s looks and background. If any democrat did even half of what he has done, they would have been impeached already.
@FoxNews @RepMarkMeadows @FBI The man was to retire with full benefits on Monday. This was a political hit job to keep that from happening and there was zero to let him go at this point in time. It's meant to show that we have an asshole @POTUS who will abuse his power in office and intimidate staff.
@FoxNews @Marcshort45 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump has named only a few nominees. In fact, @BarackObama gace his nominee for #SCOTUS and @SenateMajLdr refused to have ANY hearings on his pick. They stole his appointment.
@realDonaldTrump Yet you've said NOTHING about the two bombings in Austin, Tx simply because it's a liberal city where @HillaryClinton won with 65% of the votes compared to your 27% of the votes. #ImpeachTrumpNow

@VP You move your plant out of the country for a set period of time, and then move it back and hire people at a lower wage. Thus you avoid contract talks with employees asking to take a pay cut.
@VP This move was planned prior to the tax cuts and they are keeping the production line in Mexico to focus that plant on the international market. Those jobs won't be paying near what they were paying prior to the line moving to Mexico. That was on purpose.

@FoxNews And what's to stop a teacher that's gone off the deep end from shooting a student or another teacher? Or any staff member? Guns will put people at risk. What's to stop someone that knows a faculty member has a gun from taking it and using? @realDonaldTrump
@NBCNews No. That's stupid just like @realDonaldTrump is. An armed teacher is less likely to be able to defend themselves along with a classroom full of students. Pure ignorance.

@FoxNews The ignorance of the right in believing that you can pray this away is just as appalling as people believing that you can pray the #Gay away. Prayer is not going to make a come back in public schools.
@FoxNews #WTF? How does prayer stop shootings? #SCOTUS ruled in Engel v. Vitale, that government-written prayers were not to be recited in public schools and were a violation of the U.S. Constitution and the Establishment Clause of the first amendment. It won't stop shootings. Period.
@marcorubio #RobotRubio seems to have installed a random bible quote generator to handle his account. #Sad People want action, not prayers or random bible quotes.
@VP @POTUS Americans don’t want anymore praying.  They want action on gun control. Praying doesn’t do anything to stop these people. As hard as it is to say and do, action can on gun control can make something of a difference.
@ThisWeekABC Yet they arrived separately when boarding the aircraft to depart.
@FoxNews @PressSec They s#never said that there was no collusion. They stated that they have indicted #Russians. He could definitelystill have colluded prior to entering the race.
@CNN Gun control does not mean dismantling the 2A. It means to ensure those that should not have access to weapons don’t have access to them. Such as terrorist or the mentally ill.
@SenateGOP @business I don’t. I expect any pay raise to be wiped out once I file for taxes next year. Income is still income and can put one in a highe le tax bracket.
@LouDobbs @JonathanTurley @realDonaldTrump No they aren’t.  He could have still colluded with prior to entering the race. Doing so would have given him the opportunity to do so in exchange for providing favors to them.
@NBCNews Actually, it does nothing of the sort. @realDonaldTrump could still have colluded with the #Russians prior to entering the race. He could have made an agreement that if they did interfere, that he would accommodate them.
@realDonaldTrump How do you know when they started? You still sought out their help. You asked specifically for them to hack @HillaryClinton emails. Your advisors, and campaign staff have admitted to making contact with them.

@marcorubio Faux christians such as you selecting bible quotes at random are meaningless. If you were truly a christian, you wouldn't cut entitlement programs. You would ask the rich to do more and pay more to help out there fellow brethren.
@GOP @POTUS What he had to say was meaningless. There was nothing about taking responsibility and nothing on how he plans to handle these shootings. This is what he should have said. 	https://t.co/V0vj0NSWl2
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine NO! Just no. How sad is it that you are trying to justify having metal detectors at schools? That you're calling for experienced cops? Perimeter control? Is it a school or is it a prison? No teacher should have to carry a weapon. Mental health is the big issue here.
@FoxNews @tedcruz Ok then, why not give it a month and then start talking about gun control? Or, let me guess, if there is another shooting, that won't be the right time either?
@marcorubio You're wrong. 100% wrong. The #FBI had been warned about him Last year. https://t.co/n3ZoD3iCEa
@FoxNews @Judgenap More guns are not the answer and will never be the answer. You might as well be saying that more bandaids and duct tape should be used on someone that suffered an amputation and is bleeding profusely.
@PressSec He shouldn't of had to sacrifice his life. Blame the @NRA &amp; the @GOP for not pushing gun control laws. There were signs and agencies were warned about him, but that inaction let him commit the killings. The deaths of these students, teachers and others are on @realDonaldTrump
@GOP If you are truly with them, then enact a meaningful gun control law. Words are meaningless without action.
@SenateMajLdr What good does praying do for the 18th school shooting this year? It's meaningless unless you take action to try to at least enact some sort of gun control. Something enactment is better than nothing. It's a waste of time replying to congressional members like you.
@FoxNews @SheriffClarke the man's an asshole and like others, they say that this isn't the right time to speak of gun control. For them, there will never be a right time. The right time was before this happened and it is time now after it happened.
@marcorubio 18. Think about that for a moment. There have been 18 shootings in schools just this year alone. Praying does nothing to stop them. Action is what is needed to try to gain some control. A better background check. Mental wellness. Something better than just praying.
@realDonaldTrump These deaths are tour responsibility. You’re the commander in chief and you need to do something to stop them. Don’t just say you’re #sad to hear about them. Take action and push gun control.
@FoxNews The fact is that this will still benefit the 1% more than it will anyone else. Even tax free, $1,000 is only $85 extra over 12 months. Not a whole hell of a lot.
@SpeakerRyan Bonuses and raises have been given to less than 5 million people. There are some 140 million people employed currently and some of those have to work two jobs.
@FoxNews @POTUS The quit funding #Israel and left them fall. We have no business to provide them with any money.
@GOP Yet what @realDonaldTrump has proposed relies on cities and states doing the majority of the investment. The feds are only promising $200 billion of the $1.5 trillion
@CBSNews Still highly illegal. They admit to paying her for her silence about her affair with @realDonaldTrump. If this was a one of @TheDemocrats president's, it'd be Bill all over again. They'd would have filed to impeach him. But the @GOP knows he's so stupid, that he's their patsy.
@FoxNews @SteveHiltonx It's still crumbs even if the remove bonuses, and benefits the 1% even more. $1,000 comes out to an additional $83.00 a month. Still not enough groceries for a 4 person family for a week.
@GregAbbott_TX @TexasGOP Those given a jail sentence of more than 30 months for sexual offending are placed on the register indefinitely. Those imprisoned for between six and 30 months remain on the register for 10 years, or five years if they are under 18.
@GregAbbott_TX @TexasGOP They are NOT freeing any of them. They are redoing their sex offender list. If the person has not committed an additional offense after 10 years, they can petition to remove themselves from the registry, and after 20 years they could also be removed. Texas removes some already
@SenateMajLdr @pfizer @HomeDepot I will gladly pay more in taxes to make sure that everyone is provided healthcare and we need to tax the 1%, not give them a tax break. That money is not spent. That money is stuffed away in bonds and stocks which do not benefit the economy. Bonuses are one time crumbs.
@GOP Do you hate #America? Because this has been going on for centuries. One family member comes first and then after proving that they can bring and support their family, they are heavily vetted and allowed to bring them over. Many are outstanding citizens.

@GOP It was @BarackObama that turned the economy around after the @gop and Bush led us into a recession. #Obama’s financial year did end at the end of October, but it still carried the economy. Now with the tax cut, it’s staring to sputter, fail and balloon the deficit.

@GOP Can you cite where specifically the references to “god” are in the Constitution? Not creator as it is disambiguous when reading the Constitution. Our founders did not write the pledge, a socialist did, and God was added in the 1950s to it and our money.
@realDonaldTrump Yet, that didn't stop you from accusing @BarackObama providing a fake birth certificate, or doubling down that the #CentralParkFive were all guilty. Where was their due process?
@realDonaldTrump The memo was scrutinized and approved for release by a republican led intelligence committee. If they felt that there was something to redact, they wouldn't have authorized it to be released. Again, an intelligence committee led by #Republicans agreed to #ReleaseTheDemMemo

@FoxNews @POTUS No. Our rights are given to us depending on the country we live in. "God" did not write the constitution of the U.S. and many of the founders were deist and did not include any wording about a creator or a "God" in the constitution for a reason.
@HouseGOP @NancyPelosi An increase of $300 a month in premiums isn’t covered by $47 extra in a paycheck. It’s a loss of $206 a month.
@realDonaldTrump God is not mentioned in the constitution. The ORIGINAL pledge made no mentions of a god. It was added in the 1950s. #SCOTUS stated in Arnow v US, In God We Trust, is a motto and does not refer to a deity or establish a religion. Hence forth, nothing to do with a creator.

@FoxNews @TuckerCarlson This is due to the fact that the president is a complete and utter moron that believes in conspiracy theories. He has the intelligence of a rock that failed pre-school. Even Baldrick has better plans than #Trump does and he had purchased a turnip for £400k
@realDonaldTrump #LittleTrump just had almost a 2,000 point loss against the stock markets and over $1 trillion wiped out. @Carrier is still closing their plant and moving to #Mexico who has no plans to help fund the #TrumpWall. Which he is now demanding #Congress make the US pay for it. #sad

@SenateMajLdr @Lowes Still less than 2% of the working public will see a bonus or a raise. The top bonuses are being paid to long time workers with 20 years and will drop from there. Part timers receive half the bonus. It's crumbs and BS to make these companies look good. A tax write off for them.

@SenateGOP Wow. This is the umpteenth time that this has been reposted. I take that it's automated to spam this? One more time. Bonuses are taxed at 39.1% while a raise of the same mount is based on your total income. A permanent raise is worth more than a one time bonus.
@realDonaldTrump Not because of YOUR policies. These rates were started and continue due to @BarackObama’s policies. #ImpeachTrump
@realDonaldTrump It's a horrible deal. It makes America white again. The levels allowed are the lowest since the 1920s. It heavily penalizes those that are trying to come to the US. It's dead on arrival not just with @TheDemocrats but with most of the @GOP.

@SenateGOP @NancyPelosi And even then, some companies are handing out $25 - $50 gift cards. Just crumbs.
@SenateGOP @NancyPelosi That $1,000 bonus for most of these companies goes only to those that have been there for 20 years. It drops to $200 for people that have been at a company between 2-5 years. Under 2 years you get nothing. It's just crumbs under 20 years of working for a company.
@tedcruz Not only that, since the bonus is one time, it's possible for another pay raise the following year. Mr. 1%
@tedcruz Then let me say it. I make about $50k a year. A bonus of $1000 is taxed at almost 40%. That bonus is $600 after taxes and it's just crumbs. I'd take a pay raise of 2.5% over the bonus as it will come out to be more than $600 dollars. Not much, but still more.
@SenateGOP @NancyPelosi I'd take a permanent pay raise over a crumb of a bonus. After taxes, that $1000 comes out to $600 or an additional $50 a month. ONE TIME BONUS. Meaningless when you have health care bills over $1000 easily for a trip to the emergency room, or stay in a hospital.

@realDonaldTrump Aww. Did poor baby @realDonaldTrump miss his party? Is he #sad? This is a #TrumpShutdown as there were two #CR that could have been signed already. There was also an agreement that was reneged on. It is the president's responsibility to broker a deal. So do it. Get back to work
@FoxNews @foxandfriends @SebGorka @realDonaldTrump was given what he wanted with his meeting with @SenSchumer. Yet hours later his "OFFICE" called to say no deal. #Trump is not in charge of the #WH, he's just a puppet. He's too stupid to work out a deal. #TrumpShutdown
@tedcruz @realDonaldTrump You have little room to talk. You shutdown the government for 16 days in 2013 and cost the economy $24 BILLION dollars. @realDonaldTrump was offered a bipartisan bill that funded #CHIP, the military and his damn #BorderWall yet he rejected it. #TrumpShutdown
@GOP No. The lack of leadership, as @realDonaldTrump blamed @BarackObama in 2013, is what caused the #TrumpShutdown. Even 4 @gop members voted AGAINST the budget. #CHIP was held hostage and should have been resolved 4 months ago. You all own it.
@SpeakerRyan @SenSchumer reached an agreement with @realDonaldTrump to fund his wall and other concessions, yet hours later he reneged. He gave him what he wanted. This is a #paulryanshutdown #TrumpShutdown #McConellshutdown #GOPshutdown. #CHIP should have been funded 4 months ago. It's yours
@SenateMajLdr @CDCgov You had the choice of funding #CHIP four months ago, yet you persisted to hold off to use it as a hostage for this budget. You could have voted when presented by @TheDemocrats a bipartisan budget yet again, you resisted bringing to a vote. #TrumpShutdown #McConellshutdown
@HouseGOP @SenateDems And yet, 4 members of the @GOP voted against the bill. Not even your own party members are united with the budget. Fund #CHIP and the military now, and continue to work out the budget with retroactive pay for all government employees. block congressional and president's paychecks

@GOPChairwoman @GOP @POTUS I find it hilarious that a Romney is brown nosing @realDonaldTrump by dropping Romney from her name instead of embracing her grandfather @MittRomney and keeping the name. It's like spitting in Mitt's face and tell him to screw off. Pathetic #Sad

@FoxNews Hurricanes are regional and only affect a small portion of the country. A federal #TrumpShutdown affects the entire nation. It has a much bigger impact. And speaking of them, where is #PuertoRico's funding? Texas? truth is, it didn't affect @BarackObama economy either.

@realDonaldTrump Yet 4 #republicans voted against the bill and 5 #democrats voted for the bill. Even if you had more republicans, there was no chance for the bill to pass due to how the funding was being spent. #ImpeachTrumpNow
#TrumpShutdown means no more free airplane rides for @realDonaldTrump to go play golf at his resorts. #Sad.
@HouseGOP @SenateDems @SenTedCruz shutdown the government for 16 days in 2013. The @GOP blocked numerous military spending bills under @BarackObama. You have no right to speak and point fingers at @TheDemocrats. 4 members of your own members also voted against the bill.
@realDonaldTrump This is your presidency and this is the #TrumpShutdown. There were also 4 Republicans that opposed the bill. You are the president and you are solely responsible for this #governmentshutdown, no one else.
@SenateMajLdr @DeptofDefense This not @TheDemocrats shutdown. This is the #TrumpShutdown. He's the president and he owns it.
@JohnCornyn #Chip needs to be a seperate item. It should never be held hostage pending the passage of another bill.
@realDonaldTrump Do you know proper english grammar? Past = gone by in time and no longer existing. Like your presidency should soon be. While Pass = move or cause to move in a specified direction. Such as a bill passing in #Congress

@SpeakerRyan The @GOP repeatedly blocked military funding under @BarackObama. @SenTedCruz shutdown #Congress to read "Green Eggs and Ham." #CHIP should never be included in another bill. It must be funded on its own.
@SenateMajLdr You have no heart or soul. You already gave that to #Satan when you sold out the middle class to give the 1% and corporations tax cuts. Funding for #Chip should be a standalone bill. Not part of any other funding.
@SenateGOP @SenSchumer @SenateDems @SenTedCruz shutdown congress for 16 days. I bet he still doesn't know what "Green eggs and Ham," is about? You don't get to call out @TheDemocrats when this is a page out of the @GOP handbook.
@realDonaldTrump No. You stated that it must span the entire southern border. Not a fence, but a solid wall. #ImpeachTrumpNow
@SenateMajLdr How? The @GOP control both houses and the presidency. If there is a shut down, then it’s due to members of the #GOP voting against the bills. They are to blame.
@HouseGOP Fund it in a standalone bill. Do not attach it to any other spending, or action. If you do, then you're just proving the fact that you have no care for children. You're just being petty and showing that not even children are fair game for your hatred.
@SpeakerRyan Let’s lead with green energy and do away with fossil fuels. Let coal die. Let oil die. The oil and coal companies that realize they’re dying are starting to look to green energy. They know they need to move on.
@SpeakerRyan You are saying the same things that @TheDemocrats were saying when @BarackObama was in office and you and the @GOP were blocking him on fundings. You cannot argue this.
@DailyCaller Hey about that #Benghazi thing that the @GOP had a hard on for. How's that going? And what of @HillaryClinton's email? And #UraniumOne? Oh, and that #BlueDress?
New California was proposed by the #Russians and it is still being pressed by them and their bots. The constitution states no new states may be formed from or created inside another state without that state's legislation approval and congress. It'll never happen.

@PeteSessions As a single individual making almost $50k a year, I might at the top end see an additional $60 a month. I spend at least that much going out and on entertainment a month. It's nothing but a drop in the bucket for me.
@LouDobbs Not going to happen. US ARTICLE IV, SECTION 3, CLAUSE 1, states no new state may be created from another state unless that state's legislation approves it along with congress.
@HouseGOP The @GOP repeatedly blocked @BarackObama when he was asking to fund the military. And now you want to fund them only because there is an R in the WH. An R that is so stupid and will sign ANYTHING put before him thinking that he's actually accomplishing something. #VoteOutTheGop
@realDonaldTrump Copy and paste? Unless you're losing your memory, this has been posted already.
@the_cranberries my condolences to the band members, her family and her friends. I feel in love with her and her music when I first heard it. I am truly saddened about her passing and wish you all well. Dolores O'Riordan. R.I.P. 😢
@PressSec El Paso is the 13th safest city in Texas out of 24 major cities and has a crime index of 29 out of 100. You may call it safe, but it still has a high crime rate compared to other Texas cities and the rest of the country.
@SpeakerRyan So, 2 million out of a working population of some 138 million people are getting bonuses? That's about a whopping 1.4% of the working public. What about the remaining 98.6% of the working public? Nothing about them getting these raises and bug bonuses. Maybe a $25 gift card?
@realDonaldTrump And to beef up the #military, you want to take money away from the poor, sick, old and various entitlement programs. We spend more on our military than the next 10 countries combined. It needs to be spent better and the military needs to be fully audited.
@nikkihaley I bet you do. Just look at how many white people are in it. Not one minority. Makes you feel all warm and squishy inside, doesn't it? How cute. So, where's the next photo showing you all in your all white outfits?
@realDonaldTrump You're a dumbass. Bush arranged for a new British embassy to be built. Yes it was completed under the @BarackObama administration, but it was already signed prior to his taking office. We also didn't own the land we leased it. We do now. We sold a building. #ImpeachTrumpnow

@GOP @realDonaldTrump If we're going to start to deport naturalized citizens, why not start with #MelaniaTrump for lying about not working in the US.
@SenateGOP Taxed at about 35% for bonuses, that comes out to about a one time amount of around $487. That’s not enough for rent for the majority of #Americans and maybe enough to pay part of a medical bill.
@SpeakerRyan @USNavy @USArmy @usairforce That’s due to the fact the you and the rest of the @GOP refused to vote on funding them when @BarackObama was in office.
@GOP Yes, well over 10k have lost their jobs and will be filing for unemployment. Great going. #impeachtrumpnow and then remove the rest of the #GOP congressional members.
How in the hell don't you get that @realDonaldTrump is trying everything he can to get #impeached? He won't quit. That's a narcissistic trait. @GOP @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr He does not want to remain in office. #ImpeachTrumpNow. You'll all be out of office next election.
@SpeakerRyan The maternity leave is only for managers and not for low level employees. They just closed 63 Sam's Club locations by locking out employees with no notice. Only those that worked 20 years will get top bonus, and everyone else gets shit.

@FoxNews @KellyannePolls @HillaryClinton None of my friends or family have mentioned the election. They hardly mention how often the @GOP bring it up too. We don't care. @realDonaldTrump just thinks she's hot and wants to bang her. He's obsessed with her.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Admit it. You keep talking about @HillaryClinton because you think she's hot. Because you know she has power. You want to grab her. You want her. Why else would you be so obsessed with her? #ImpeachTrumpNow Before he grabs and bangs #HillaryClinton

I meant that a few 100k are being laid off. https://t.co/EnxGr0I7v1
@SenateGOP And a few 100k of them are being paid off. The jobs numbers for December were anemic and more people are working two jobs to make ends meet.
@HouseGOP Bonuses are taxed at around 35%. That's about an extra $54 a month for 1 year
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump And 10k's of thousands are being laid off!! Just like we want #Trump to be. 😂
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Job growth for December 2017 was predicting to be 190,000 and #trump said it was going to be 250,000. Reality is that it was at about 170,000 which shows a weakening and stagnating economy. Job numbers will begin to fall and unemployment will either begin to rise or lied about.
@realDonaldTrump Still behind @BarackObama when it comes to the stock market. Sad. #ImpeachTrump

@RepSmucker TBH, I'd be willing to pay more in taxes for universal healthcare. That's what we need and that's what we will never get from a @GOP congress or president.
@RepSmucker So, researching what I will do for me, is maybe $400 in tax cuts. Possibly a whole $33 a month for me. That's nothing. Doesn't cover utilities, insurance, car, housing or any other bill. It will be one weeks worth of groceries, or 1.5 gas fill ups. I
@PressSec Bonuses are taxed at about 35%. Meaning, that they are getting around $650 after taxes. Or, an extra $54 a month. Or, $12.50 a week. That's enough to go crazy at Taco Bell, Jack in the Box, or two Subway sandwiches on sale. It's nothing to most people.
@realDonaldTrump There were over 61k gun incidents in 2017. 15k+ deaths that you are responsible for. 31k in juries, 732 children under the age of 11 killed by you. 345 mass shootings committed by you. 317 officers injured or killed by you too. 3,228 teenagers between 12-17 shot or killed.

@BillOReilly Do, how much do you get for each tweet shilling for companies? Are you getting so desperate for money that you’re becoming a paid advertising account?
@FoxNews @POTUS @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump Plus, he has killed more civilians than under #Obama during his full term.
@FoxNews @POTUS This is due to the fact that he’s still following @BarackObama plans. @realDonaldTrump hasn’t done anything original or that he has come up with. He also let the military continue #Obama’s hands off policy.
@GovWalker @BizTimesMedia #Foxconn fired 60,000 workers and automated the assembly line. If you believe that they plan to hire thousands of workers, you're clearly disussional.

@FoxNews @pnjaban @JudgeJeanine This stupid cunt just needs to shut up. The evidence provided was not enough to convict the man. It was proven that the gun in question had been left there was stolen and left by other people. It had a hair trigger that even some cops have had them go off accidently.
@cathymcmorris @HouseGOP As a single person that makes$50k a year gross, this is not going to give me a raise at work. It's going to make my taxes go up as I have no kids, and I'm not in college. I get screwed based on the plan that was passed. I will pay more in taxes because of it.
@SenateGOP But how much of an increase will a single person with no kids see? Someone that makes $50k will owe taxes since they would no longer have any deductions.
@HouseGOP Tax cuts do not create jobs. They do not create an incentive for employers to provide wage increases. Those so called economists are members of the @GOP. Ten times the number have stated it will increase the deficit and raise taxes on the middle class.

@FoxNews @TuckerCarlson One of the biggest issues, is that people don't come out about these incidents until after the statutes of limitations has passed. These people feel that no one will believe them or they're intimidated into remaining silent. Not all will see their day in court.
@GOP BS, #TrickleDown never did anything to to boost the economy. In fact it's because of it that we're in the quagmire that we're in now. The rich have gotten richer, and will be even richer if this passes, and the poor and middle class will be even poorer.
@SenateMajLdr These "tax cuts" do nothing for those of us that are single. In fact, we will be seeing our taxes going up. So instead of tax breaks, we will be paying income taxes instead of receiving any sort of a tax refund. If you cut anything, cut @realDonaldTrump vacation budget.
@SpeakerRyan If #realDonaldTrump kills #NAFTA, those numbers in #Texas and #California will be negative 1 million. And every other state will also be in the negative due to how much trade they do with Mexico.

@FoxNews You can't lose something that you never had. Ever since #Reaganomics, and before really, the @GOP has been shitting on the middle and lower classes. They don't care for them as can be seen in their platform and the bills that they have introduced.
@GOP Lower corporate taxes have never in the history of the world, created more jobs. That's BS. #Reaganomics did not create jobs. It only lead to the wealthy to stash more money offshores and lead to a greater deficit and a wider gap in income. You're full of shit for saying other.
@FoxNews @POTUS You're just a propaganda machine for @realDonaldTrump and refuse to do actual news concerning him. Investigate his ties to #Russia and ask him real questions.
@CBSNews @DavidAgus If one is a typical obese #American that needs a rascal to get a around with a bottle of oxygen attached to it. I won't be one of them. I don't believe in gorging myself. I also don't go to buffets circling the steam tables riding rascals looking for all you can eat.
@realDonaldTrump Just shut up about this and stop trying to distract people from your criminal dealings with the #Russians during the election. #ImpeachTrump and #Lockhimup forever. A real man wouldn't demand people thank him for doing something that ANY president should be doing. #Dumbass
@realDonaldTrump He was talking bad about @BarackObama? The bastard. Remove him from office now! Oh, wait, he was talking about you. I say that he needs to say more things publicly about the worst president ever! Namely you.
@realDonaldTrump Just because someone does a good deed, they shouldn't expect anything in return. A good deed is done out of the goodness of one's heart. Lashing out as you are shows that you're a complete and utter #dumbass who is demanding that they be recognized and held in awe. #ImpeachTrump
@GOP As a single person that cannot claim any of the touted deductions, I will be paying more in taxes. I don't have kids, can't take the earned income, or other deductions.
@FoxNews @Varneyco Not they won’t. Companies don’t just pay hiker wages with tax cuts. They don’t pay higher wages with higher earnings. Business 101 will probably teach you that. In fact, companies are already saying they’re not going to do that. It benefits only the top management.
@FoxNews That is BS. This has been going on for decades and eons. The sheer stupidity that this only something that has started is ignorant. A lot of these accusations are from the 80s, which is prior to the internet. Fucking idiots
@realDonaldTrump IT"S OVER! You fucktard. Why in the hell are you so fixated on the 2016 election? She's also not running. Step down and resign in disgrace for being the laughing stock of the world and the leaders. Mr. #SmallhandsTrump

@FoxNews Yet you won't call for @POTUS @realDonaldTrump to resign for even worse.
@SpeakerRyan I don't have kids, and I'm single so that's not what I need or looking for. I will still pay more under your plan than I do now. Those of us that are single are getting screwed.
@FoxNews No matter what type of cup @Starbucks sells, there will be people accusing them of something that goes against someone's moral principles. Someone will be butt hurt.

@GregAbbott_TX Praying the gun violence away is meaningless. It may give you a false sense of hope, but taking action on gun control can help more than the inaction that the @GOP and you have done. If prayer helped to end evil, we would have accomplished ridding the world of evil eons ago.

@GregAbbott_TX @TexasGOP This is due to #NAFTA and trade with #Mexico. It helps employe 1 mil #Texans.
@politico @ludacristiano 3 members of the @GOP voted against the measure. If you lay blame, then they are the reason. He left them and women out of the talks. He is
@FoxNews McCain never intended to vote for repeal. His goal was to allow a vote and then to vote it down.
@GovMikeHuckabee Never happen. 2/3 of both houses + 3/4 of states to amend, Even a convention of states need the 3/4 of states to amend The Constitution
@realDonaldTrump The implosion of #Obamacare will be your responsibility as the sitting president. Your administration will be to blame.
@glennbeck Sure, That would put @seanhannity @foxnews and the other Fox shows off the air as they couldn't afford to pay any fines.
@nytvideo Because the phrase is owned by NBC and he'd probably get sued for using it. He might as well use it; he's getting sued by others.
@realDonaldTrump After 7 years? They've had 7 years to propose and work with @TheDemocrats to better #Obamacare and then shut them and women out of talks.
@FoxNews @SHSanders45 @POTUS But can he walk or eat and have any sort of comprehensible thought at the same? We think not.
@FoxNews @foxandfriends @EricTrump @POTUS That's not true. They, along with women, were not invited to even discuss a replacement by the @GOP
@FoxNews @SHSanders45 @POTUS Kid must have been on a sugar high. I'm sure that he'll regret after he comes out of his sugar coma.

@realDonaldTrump Pardons will not stop impeachment of a president nor would they reverse it. And that power extends ONLY to federal crimes, not state crimes.

@tedcruz You've had 7 years to provide an alternative. If you had a valid plan, I bet that @BarackObama would have signed it. Single payer healthcare
@CNN You mean, they have to protect white voters from the scary black man and other bad hombres. Purging anyone that's not white enough.

@realDonaldTrump If the @GOP would have worked with @BarackObama and the @TheDemocrats during his admin, then it would be easier. #snowflake

@realDonaldTrump Thanks @BarackObama for the wonderful job you. Will be sad to see it waste away as the #snowflake in office will waste it away.
@FoxNews Yet the thought of millions losing healthcare and cutting medicare, thrills him as he can buy another golden toilet seat with tax savings

@ABC He retweeted an account he's following of a racist antisemite. This is the real issue.
@realDonaldTrump The job numbers are fake. How could they be real if they haven't changed since @BarackObama left office? #Snowflake By raising minimum wage
@CBSNews Let's be honest can call it what it is. Repeal and let die. There is no incentive to replace it once it's repealed.
@ThisWeekABC There are insane people that will take it as approval from the president that threatening reporters is fine. The maker is also a racist.

@CIOontheGo @FoxNews @RealDrGina @SecretService And what about @TedNugent and his comment about @BarackObama? Wasn't enforced on him and he got invited to the WH.
@ThisWeekABC @realDonaldTrump never spoke out about @TedNugent saying if @BarackObama won again, that he'd end up in jail or dead.
@HouseGOP It failed as @GOP states failed to accept it and expand medicare, Had that happened, it would work as intended.
@GOP @POTUS The economy and employment is still based on @BarackObama. It takes a year before we see the effects of a new administration.
@realDonaldTrump Then admit that they helped you steal the election and let's do it over again with better candidates. Neither your or @HillaryClinton
@FoxNews @RealDrGina @POTUS If they didn't go after Nugget for saying he'd do the same to @BarackObama, then just #STFU
@SpeakerRyan @SteveScalise They're meaningless. Get to work and provide a better option on healthcare. Yours increase cost over 250% and no one read it.
@ABC And yet, Nugget said similar about @BarackObama and nothing was said about it by @POTUS #snowflakes. In fact he invited him to the WH.
@GregAbbott_TX @loiskolkhorst @CindyBurkett_TX @RepThierry146 @RepWalle The Texas #txlege slashed women's healthcare funding. It sits around 43rd in the nation. It's at the top of maternal mortality due to cuts.
@SenateMajLdr You're going to change it by make premiums go even higher. And not only throwing 24 million off of healthcare but 75 million off of Medicare
@FoxNews But that's what wives are supposed to do. Calm their little children down and make them feel special. @newtgingrich

Furthermore, why the hell is @newtgingrich even on tv? He's irrelevant &amp; doesn't hold an office. Hell, I'd take Bush over him almost any day
@newtgingrich is a big asshat for comparing an investigation to an indian hunting party. As a descendant of native americans, screw him
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Damn #snowflake doesn't understand that @BarackObama's poll number were at 65% approval. That's &gt;50% needs to shove numbers up his bum
@FoxNews @SundayFutures @marcorubio @POTUS No one is asking to support @HillaryClinton, people want to hold #snowflake @POTUS accountable for his actions. That includes impeachment

@FoxNews @DonaldJTrumpJr Big laff coming from someone that will never truly know what it's like to struggle. And I don't mean which country club to stay at.
@POTUS will never know what it's like to struggle in life to pay bills &amp; feed family. He only struggles with which wine for dinner.
@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump @VP No wall. No money for a wall. No #Obamacare repeal. Failed for 2 or 3 times now? He's only signed EOs. The jobs carried from @BarackObama
@realDonaldTrump @marthamaccallum @FoxNews Only if you're planning to step down from office. If not, then it's not worth my time.
@VP @POTUS And switch the cuts to everything else. #100days Also increasing taxes on everyone but him and the oligarchy lead congress
@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump He has until the end of the year at most. Quit your delusional rambling old man and take your med's.

@FoxNews @tedcruz You can't seize assets that are not in the US. His money and assets are in MEXICO. Do you think that they will allow the US to take them? No
@realDonaldTrump you do realize that Texas does $96 BILLION in exports to Mexico with #NAFTA and employes over 1 million people? Stop Think
@LouDobbs @SecretaryRoss Texas has 1 million jobs due to #NAFTA and exported $90 billion to mexico. Doing away with it will devastate the Texas economy.

@GregAbbott_TX They stole a seat from @BarackObama that was rightfully his. They don't need to confirm him at all.
@FoxNews It "may" have a small reduction, but full repeal of all drug war laws would have a bigger impact. Legalize and control distribution
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS You didn't have to filibuster Garland. You flat out stole his seat like your lord and emperor #Satan commanded you to do. #SCOTUS
@GOP You've not only voted against said bills, but your #snowflake of a @POTUS has signed actions against them
@GOP @GorsuchFacts I'd say that maybe possibly probably that theft of a #SCOTUS pick is a good reason to say no. I'd bet you'd say the same if it was turned
@GregAbbott_TX How about no?
@SenateMajLdr You and your friend and lover #Satan did worse by not even allowing @BarackObama to pick the #SCOTUS when he was in office
@realDonaldTrump Did you ever pull head from your behind and realize you already won the election? Distractions are for #snowflakes and losers

@realDonaldTrump They stated this was from 2015. #snowflake is living in an alt-reality. Nothing to do with Don the Con
@SpeakerRyan @POTUS the fundamental truth is that Green Energy is driving our demand now. Coal is dead, and oil is not far behind.
@JohnCornyn had Texas expanded Medicaid coverage at the time, I probably wouldn't have had to pay it then. I have new job and insurance now

@seanhannity there's no incentive to introduce anything once it's repealed. Repeal and throw it in the trash if nothing replaces it now.
@CNN but this is only phase 1 of how many phases? How many more pages to be added?
@CBSNews the estimate of the @GOP plan is an increase of over $1200 a year. How is that making things more affordable?
@GregAbbott_TX that is until there is a border wall and a tax on imports and exports by the wild Orangeman in office
@LouDobbs @POTUS there's no need for anyone to subvert him when he's doing a great job at doing it to himself.
@realDonaldTrump 113 were released by Bush, not @BarackObama. It's really sad we have an uneducated person as president. #snowflake
@fxnopinion @RandPaul @RepMarkMeadows @FoxNews you don't repeal &amp; then replace later. There is no later if you don't do it at the same time
@HouseGOP where is buying across state lines? This should be in this plan, not something that you claim comes latter. Do it now not later

@GOP by failed you mean it covered 12+ million that wouldn't have had coverage and helped families cover healthcare cost. Yours won't.
@SenateMajLdr however that same 80% is in favor of the #ACA. It depends on the spin. Have you called Satan to say you love him yet?
@POTUS just because you leave the key lock on to make capital letters doesn't make anyone great again. That's also called shouting.
@realDonaldTrump they started planning this starting back in 2013 when @BarackObama was in office. You have zero to do with it.
@GregAbbott_TX let's not forget the original Tejanos that were also there to defend the Alamo.
@glennbeck Not one of them were born in Texas. Juan Seguin was, but I get it that people only hear about the ones on your list. How sad,
@SenateMajLdr the plan has bigger penalties than the #ACA had. It also doesn't allow one to purchase insurance across state lines. Satan 💝 U
@TeaPainUSA @NewYorker seeing as Cher is still on tour, I think #TrumpRussia is up for the challenge of surpassing her.
@realDonaldTrump so don't buy any clothing sold by the #Trumpfamily. Right for it. Buy American. #Trump clothes made in China and Mexico
@LouDobbs he stared the it wasn't @BarackObama but the administration. They've done it to members of congress too. He didn't order it.
@LouDobbs so long as they're doing an investigation on #Trump and his ties to Russia, go for it.
@realDonaldTrump they paled in comparison to the anti-Trump rallies. How sad that your snowflakes need a safe space to feel wanted.
RT @StephenKing: Trump should know OBAMA NEVER LEFT THE WHITE HOUSE! He's in the closet! HE HAS SCISSORS!
@CNN @marcorubio but it is unusual that they deny the meeting and then later they say that it did take place.
RT @LOLGOP: It's why the Orwell book of the day is Animal Farm not 1984. https://t.co/CvGUacyCJF
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends that was you and and your friends. It's on the tapes that @BarackObama had made. Listen to them, you're prez
@FoxNews ok, the special snowflakes have found their safe space and can give each other hugs and feel all warm a funny inside. Good for them
@realDonaldTrump Yes, #GWB Patriot Act allows #NSA to do so! Ask an adult to explain it to you. You could learn a lot from an adult! 😉
@realDonaldTrump Who alt right site you read that on? #GWB signed the Patriot Act. Read and educate yourself. There are no pictures however.
@realDonaldTrump It wasn't @BarackObama, it was the NSA and thanks to #GWB the Patriot Act is legal! You should educate yourself about it.
@GregAbbott_TX Actually, there are those of us that do. Except for violent criminals. The ones that haven't caused issues should stay.
@realDonaldTrump Actually, it's perfectly legal because of the Patriot Act and done by the NSA. Thanks GWB and then @BarackObama
@CBSNews and yet @realDonaldTrump is still here in the country.

@politico what's with that hair? It seems to be getting thicker and darker. how much does a Shatner like that cost? @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
@SenateMajLdr Satan has a special place for you. Why don't you go see it really really soon? Like now.
@realDonaldTrump I await for your impeachment any day now. If the @GOP had the gumption to do it instead of brown nosing you.
@SenateMajLdr As a member of the middle class, I have done quite well.
RT @TeaPartyCat: Can't wait to get rid of Obamacare! I hear Trumpcare will do for healthcare what Trump University did for higher education.
@NRSC empty talking points. These mean nothing.
@nprpolitics @realDonaldTrump pathetic attempt to sooth the loss of Ryan is just sad. He's using him as a talking point. Nothing more
Until @realDonaldTrump fires Bannon, I will never respect the man. Until he fires Sessions, I will never ever support him. Impeach now
@glennbeck At least I got a screenshot of voting first showing 100% yes. 🤣
@FoxNews @POTUS @foxandfriends and they will be goose stepping in parades in front of the WH as he watches them from a podium.
@FoxNews @KarlRove if you don't increase the military and reduce waste, entitlements are fine. Just fraction of military spending
