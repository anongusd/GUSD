@map_dean @jpd7890 @astewart72 @ZacusJ Because we get consent.  Children, as is widely known, cannot give consent, so any sexual contact with a child, is by definition, rape.  Made more heinous because they cannot protect themselves.

@V1G4M1 @jenniferjmedina Not really.  Would it not make you uncomfortable to be around someone who said they want to rape you?  Wanting to have sex with a child is wanting to rape.  Again...if you're ok with any kind of pedophilia, you're either stupid or evil.
@DineshDSouza My wife and her family, as well.  I had no idea until she explained it to me.  I think we need immigration reform, but not open borders.  The cost of legal immigration needs to be lowered somehow.
@V1G4M1 @jenniferjmedina Im not missing a point.  Normalizing pedophilia in any way is  a bad idea.  Even "non offending" pedophilia.  They are admitted powder kegs and only have to slip up one time.  Plus, it propogates a market for child porn.  If you support pedophilia, you're either dumb or evil.

Funny how leftists fight hardest against the unborn, seeing as how they can't fight back.
@CJGassen @TroyDot @RangersUnited94 @KyleKashuv No... it doesnt.  People have brains.  Everyone knows sex can lead to pregnancy.  Everyone knows that abstinence is the only 100% way to avoid pregnancy.  Social and societal factors are irrelevant, and biology doesnt make you have sex.  It makes you WANT sex. Be an adult.
@CJGassen @TroyDot @RangersUnited94 @KyleKashuv So, when exactly does that happen?
@CJGassen @TroyDot @RangersUnited94 @KyleKashuv So they can't not have sex?   THAT is the ridiculous argument.
@TroyDot @CJGassen @RangersUnited94 @KyleKashuv Nope.  You're exactly right.
@CJGassen @TroyDot @RangersUnited94 @KyleKashuv The taking of human life is murder.  A fetus is human life.
@TroyDot @CJGassen @RangersUnited94 @KyleKashuv Then don't fuck guys.  Period.  That's easy.
@CJGassen @TroyDot @RangersUnited94 @KyleKashuv Lol.  Yes... punish women by not allowing them to murder children.  Im such a bad guy.  What a villain!
@IutaroG @TroyDot @RangersUnited94 @CJGassen @KyleKashuv Manslaughter is also characterized by negligence.  Miscarriages are not usually due to negligence but rather INVOLUNTARY hormone changes.  Thanks for playing.
@CJGassen @TroyDot @RangersUnited94 @KyleKashuv Dangerous abortions might make women think twice about letting irreaponsible fuckboys put babies in them.  When they have to be responsible for their actions, they may not so flippantly murder as a means of birth control.
@TroyDot @RangersUnited94 @CJGassen @KyleKashuv Im not policing what she does with her body.  I just want muderers held accountable.  I know where pro choice is coming from.  I used to BE pro choice.  Then I actually put thought into it. https://t.co/j7IccPZwuM

@TroyDot @RangersUnited94 @CJGassen @KyleKashuv The choice of murder.  I think sex ed is important, but has nothing to do with the unjustified killing of another soul just to avoid responsibility of her own actions.  You will never convince me of that.
@LibSocCaucusLP @RonOfTheAgora @mnrothbard @funlibertarian2 Nope.  I know what a libertarian is.
@TroyDot @RangersUnited94 @CJGassen @KyleKashuv Rape wasnt a choice... so her pregnancy wasnt a choice and she should not be held to account for that.  An abortion as birth control is 100% voluntary on the conception and killing end. Like I said... keep conflating.  It's ok.  I know you can't do better.
@TroyDot @RangersUnited94 @CJGassen @KyleKashuv VOL👏UN👏TAR👏Y.    The woman had no choice in the rape, and incest is usually rape.  Keep conflating.  You look dumber by the second.
@TroyDot @RangersUnited94 @CJGassen @KyleKashuv And I'm fighting for a soul who has no voice.  If they do it with light hearts, explain to me that shit show Michelle Wolf put out.  Explain to me why they don't have heavier hearts when letting losers put a baby in them.
RT @redsteeze: Hey you’re finally getting it https://t.co/3965EynlCs
@denise_kandra @TroyDot @RangersUnited94 @CJGassen @KyleKashuv Exactly.
@TroyDot @RangersUnited94 @CJGassen @KyleKashuv I don't.  But you're arguing for the casual murder of people because someone wanted sex without the repercussions.  You encourage irresponsibility and callous murder with your line of thinking.  I mean, what is a person other than a matured fetus?
@TroyDot @RangersUnited94 @CJGassen @KyleKashuv Do you even know what you're talking about?   Roe v. Wade is a court decision which merely set precedence.  That precedent can be changed with another ruling, which very easily could state that in cases of rape, incest, and endagerment to the mother, abortion is legal.
@DtJazzypeach @LadyThriller69 Lady... you're nuts. https://t.co/pPmaZ3NLN4
@TroyDot @RangersUnited94 @CJGassen @KyleKashuv No, you WANT that to be the case, but just about everyone agrees that pregnancies caused by rape or incest would be valid reasons for abortion, as would a pregnancy that endangers the mother's life.  But please... keep conflating shit since you just spit idiotic talk points.
@TroyDot @RangersUnited94 @CJGassen @KyleKashuv You know what this question is missing.... voluntary.   Miscarriage is not voluntary.  Rape is not voluntary.   Care to try again? https://t.co/eoO47l9PQA
