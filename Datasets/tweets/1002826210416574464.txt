@Marvel0usJesus Amen
“All children, born and unborn, are made in the Holy image of God...” AMEN!!! #SOTU⁠ ⁠
Glory to God in the highest, and peace to his people on Earth.	#PraiseJesus		That being said, if I were in DC today, I’d probably be at the #MarchForLife
I love all of you!
@Johntfalvey1 My condolences.
Preach Jesus Christ. Praise the Lord!
Whatever happens, accept Jesus. :)

@SparklesByThSea Not really. Truce? :)
@SparklesByThSea Feel better? :)
@CharlieDaniels Your concert that I saw in Iraq was very much appreciated... I gotta see if I can find footage... a big haboob hit right as “The Devil Went Down to Georgia” started playing and you stepped out on stage... 	So, anyways, “thank you” for what you do, too. :)
@ali @philbrown1776 First time I’ve seen that first point... 🤔
@VinylDlux @realDonaldTrump Seems like he’s speaking off the cuff. Like I said, I’m following along just fine. I’m not picking up the same thing you are... This is (some) real conversation and not (just) political speak... Let’s keep watching. :)
@Tat2edGran @USNret03 @SecPompeo @trumps_feed @nytimes @CIA Do the trollbot thing to me next, please... I’m intrigued... :)
Not engaging on Twitter is hard!!! I wanna say so many things, but not much is worth some of the negativity that may accompany... That being said, I’ll probably start saying (more) stuff than I have...		In Our Father, I trust.
