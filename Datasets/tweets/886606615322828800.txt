@Kvelez7 @AOC Questions: Has she made anti-Semitic remarks? Has she written a letter on behalf of ISIS members? Is she associated with radical Islamic terrorist groups? Has she done anything in her district to combat the highest % of ISIS recruitment in the USA? Does she believe in Sharia Law?
"Sharia law" is not "Islamophobia"; What the Qur'an says about "infidels" etc. is not "Islamophobia"; Anti-Semitic remarks by congress members is not "Islamophobia"; I don't care where you are from or what color you are...this is not a religious thing, Its HATE on THEIR part https://t.co/5pwPcsNceF

@mstarkston @wdunlap @AOC Yes they all get a budget from tax money my issue isn't so much about how much they are getting but what is she skimping on that the budget has to cover as well as salary? Also the original post came out like she was paying them herself like she owns it not from taxpayer money.
@KamalaHarris Having an abortion is not reproductive health &amp; PP is in the abortion business so it can sell body parts. Stop making it seem like people can't find birth control at low-cost to free at their local health department. Or are you only for abortions &amp; not really women's actual needs

watch out...but if you know this may occur entering illegally the immigrants need to take responsibility also...don't tell me that they don't know, all have cell phones and they are not US citizens so they have no right to sue....but don't pull their kids from them...that's cruel
If the only charge against an immigrant is illegal entry and nothing criminal like murder rape etc... or drug mules than they shouldn't be separated from their kids..And wans't this Jeff Sessions doing &amp; wasn't he fired?
