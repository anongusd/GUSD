Yes, government intervention drives up the cost of living - health care, housing, college, energy, etc., but dismissing the struggles because you don‚Äôt agree with their solutions isn‚Äôt helping.
Millions of Americans still lack affordable health care.  Dismissing this fact won‚Äôt win hearts and minds(or votes). A little empathy for those struggling to make ends meet goes a long way.
Cost isn‚Äôt what people who aren‚Äôt paying care about. We need to address the reason health care costs are rising and remove barriers to market competition that drive costs down and improve quality.
We need to address the real cost of care and offer solutions. Stop ceding ground and acting as if the market can‚Äôt offer more people better care for less. It can. Here‚Äôs how: https://t.co/sWUJm9aUYP

‚ÄúAffordability‚Äù is relative. The best way to make anything more affordable is to allow people to keep, save, and spend what they earn.
I didn‚Äôt come from money or academia. I didn‚Äôt come from privilege. I worked hard - really hard to rise from poverty. I‚Äôm increasingly saddened that today so few have the same opportunities I had.
Many lower-income Americans feel like the system is rigged against them. When you see the bailouts, it‚Äôs hard to disagree. We need more freedom of opportunity.
@JasonBWhitman Exactly. Highly subsidized, increasingly unaffordable.
It breaks my heart to see well-meaning people discuss subsidies as a means to affordability. It sounds great, but in reality, when you distance a person from the true cost, the cost rises, making it harder to afford.

We won‚Äôt close the income and wealth gap until we lower the cost of healthcare, food, energy, and education. We do that through free markets, not gaming the system for the well connected.
And yet nearly every ‚Äúsolution‚Äù includes subsidizing a commodity and making it harder for lower-income Americans to purchase.
Subsidizing these items makes them more expensive, not less.
If we really care about poor and lower-income Americans, we‚Äôll work to make the items they must purchase to thrive less expensive; Healthcare, food, housing, education, energy - by reducing regulation, increasing supply, allowing choice and competition.

@JimmieWrites To those who fight, I continue to pray for them. Meanwhile, I'm working nonstop to provide my daughter the best education possible.
@JimmieWrites But they don't. Where does the money go?
@JimmieWrites It's insane that public education costs almost the same for a much lower level of education. Heartbreaking that parents have few choices.
@JimmieWrites The issue is the money rarely goes to the kids and teachers. I pay $11k per year + property taxes for my daughter to attend a top school.
@JimmieWrites I honestly believe there's a disconnect but everyone looks out for their own best interest.
@JimmieWrites Agree 100%.
