@boinkofscience @AOC @RepSarbanes @GOP So you don‚Äôt support voter ID? Or only legal citizens voting? They seem quite reasonable in a society where a valid picture ID is required for so many things. Calling it voter suppression seems racist to me. Like a person of any minority can‚Äôt figure out where the DMV or SOS is?
@PaulWDrake @gimpofhearts @AOC @RepSarbanes Trust me union money is a huge problem for people like me! They‚Äôre just another special interest along with the others. It goes straight to the point that lobbying happens on both sides of the isle.

@gimpofhearts @AOC @RepSarbanes There‚Äôs plenty of special interests behind this bill too. Be skeptical. I‚Äôd love to limit special interests and force a look into all these politicians backgrounds but do you really trust all of them to pass legislation that would do that? Why no bill on term limits?
@missingocelot @AOC @RepSarbanes Trust politicians if you want. I‚Äôm sure these ones are different than all other politicians in history. They just want to wield the power of ‚Äúno‚Äù over us all. Let them prove they‚Äôre trustworthy by showing us their tax returns then I‚Äôll listen.
@AshBaloghNM @AOC @RepSarbanes Because the Dem/Socialist Politicians wouldn‚Äôt lie to us? Are you kidding? Bernie has 3 houses. Where‚Äôs Schumer, Pelosi and Fienstiens tax returns. Let them prove they‚Äôre different before you believe them!
@boinkofscience @AOC @RepSarbanes @GOP But you can trust the Dem/Socialists because they‚Äôre different? Are you kidding me? Where‚Äôs Sanders, Schumer, Pelosi, Fienstien‚Äôs tax returns? Believe what you want.
@gimpofhearts @AOC @RepSarbanes Listen corporations employ lots of people. Free market capitalism is the reason for the countless choices in goods, services and innovations. Apple and Amazon aren‚Äôt stealing money they‚Äôre providing goods and services. That‚Äôs bad?
@31WA @AOC @RepSarbanes Giving more power to a bloated, corrupt government bureaucracy seems like a good idea? They‚Äôre not just after the rich and corporations. They want to control every aspect of our lives from healthcare to what kids learn in school. Are you sure you trust them?
@EdKrassen @AOC @RepSarbanes You‚Äôre an idiot if you don‚Äôt think Dem/Socialists are up to the same games. Congress has a slush fund full of tax dollars to pay off sexual harassment claims! Look it up! Fienstien, Pelosi, Schumer, Sanders got filthy rich in public office. Let‚Äôs see their tax returns.
