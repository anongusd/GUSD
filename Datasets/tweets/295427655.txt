@ChrisJZullo Minimum wages are $9.50 or higher is 7 states &amp; $10 or higher in 3, most states are closer to $8.

@ChrisJZullo Because wages haven't increased over time as they should have, adjusting them too abruptly to correct for, will cause a sharp spike in inflation. Are hardest affected areas will be consumer goods and services which impact mid-low income families disproportionately.

@ChrisJZullo The skinny is, that demand can create supply and supply can create demand, but the idea of the product, service or commodity has to first exist. All of these tangents you're create are immaterial to the fact.
@ChrisJZullo They do all the time, it's called a prototype.
@ChrisJZullo No, I understand and actually agree with you "in general" we differ in the nuance. I'm just correcting you partial understanding of economics. Demand and supply can both be created orangically or artificialy. And both can be a catalyst for one another.
@ChrisJZullo Look, moving the topic from economics to personal desires and how they rank in accordance to personal needs, is apple and bananas. It is not an argument or debate, you change what was being talked about all together. üëè Nice try Se√±or Matador.
@shestokas @Stacey73478984 @truthseeker6761 I can see why. A personal tough goes further. As the old adage goes, "people don't care how much you know until you show how much you care."
@ChrisJZullo Demand again just states that, a product, service, or commodity has prospect at a given time. The idea of said product, service or conformity has to first exist before the supply or demand can be realized. So, supply can drive demand &amp; vice versa demand can drive for more supply.
@ChrisJZullo Supply requires manpower and capital to address demand. This is generally monolopies are damaging either for the consumer or company. This also leads into issue with patents and price gouging or manipulation in constricted markets.
@ChrisJZullo Demand truly only show prospect, it's doesn't dictate supply or legality. If that were the case, marijuana would likely be legal on state and federal levels.
@ChrisJZullo Heads up this be a more than a #280character answer. What I would &amp; do do is, ask when proposed, would it be helpful in the macro &amp; micro? Could taxes breaks to the wealthy be helpful? I say it depends, things applied in the appreciate moderation could work.
