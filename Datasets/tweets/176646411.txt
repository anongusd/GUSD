@don_crawford_ Christmas, Easter, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Memorial Day, Labor Day, Arbor Day, Pearl Harbor Day, Talk Like a Pirate Day, Birthday, and a bunch of holidays I don‚Äôt even celebrate. She‚Äôs the gift that just keeps on giving.
@don_crawford_ (2/2) Trump has a loyal yet large (for a Republican) base of black support that, I believe, will be key to winning re-election in 2020. If he can bump that 8% to 10%, 12%, maybe 15% (and the GOP continues to stay in that range), the electoral map will be unrecognizable in ‚Äò24.
@don_crawford_ (1/2) I think it‚Äôs only surprising because of the media‚Äôs suppression of events and/or groups like this. It hurts the narrative. Yet we forget that he won, and in winning, actually doubled Romney‚Äôs total of the AA vote (if we‚Äôre to fully believe exit polls).

#JudgeKavanaugh absolutely eviscerating Senate Democrats and the American left in his opening statement. #KavanaughHearing
@don_crawford_ Been watching since the moment I woke up!
@don_crawford_ There isn‚Äôt any tangible evidence (thus far). What is there to deliberate upon or even review aside from verbal testimony given during the hearing today?
We‚Äôve now reached the ‚Äúready for my 2020 close-up‚Äù portion of today‚Äôs hearing. #KavanaughHearing #FordTestimony
I don‚Äôt understand how any individual that takes a polygraph test doesn‚Äôt know *who* paid for it.		Absolutely blows my mind. #KavanaughHearing #FordTestimony
@don_crawford_ Being that the other eleventh-hour accusers have thus far rejected the opportunity to testify, I have no problem holding the vote Friday. We‚Äôve already delayed it. And again, my standard is simple: did he or didn‚Äôt he? And I‚Äôll even expand it: ‚ÄúBeyond a reasonable doubt.‚Äù
@don_crawford_ Exactly! So this shouldn‚Äôt be treated as a crime or a criminal trial until credible, tangible evidence is presented or uncovered, just like any other crime.
@don_crawford_ The vote is happening after Kavanaugh and Ford testify. The committee has bent over backwards to meet the accuser‚Äôs demands. The only ‚Äúevidence‚Äù we have is what gets disclosed tomorrow. No tangible evidence exists, so what exactly would we be reviewing in addition to testimony?
@don_crawford_ In a situation like this, the only standard I hold anyone to is simple: Did they do it or didn‚Äôt they do it? The position they‚Äôre angling for means nothing to me in determining guilt or innocence. It shouldn‚Äôt, just like gender, race, faith, etc.
@don_crawford_ Because unfounded accusations alone do not, or at least should not, disqualify him or anyone from any position, let alone consideration for that position, in a country at least partially founded upon the concept of presumed innocence and due process. Easy one, Don.

@don_crawford_ @AP Not sure how you view this, but why Dems are pinching themselves over a campaign finance violation is beyond me. Worst case, Trump camp probably pays a fine to the FEC much like Obama camp did back in ‚Äò08 for not reporting donors. I like to call it ‚Äúcollusion by proxy.‚Äù
@don_crawford_ Bank fraud. Tax fraud. Crimes indeed. But the question at hand isn‚Äôt what constitutes a legitimate crime; it‚Äôs what constitutes a legitimate investigation.
This is how deeply Mueller‚Äôs team is digging into people‚Äôs pasts, yet they still can‚Äôt find any actual evidence to confirm or even back up the collusion theory/narrative more than a year into things.
Incredible that an investigation into Russian interference in our election and collusion on behalf of the Trump campaign has led to the indictment, prosecution, and conviction of Paul Manafort on charges (8/18) completely unrelated to the campaign OR the investigation itself.
Sorry, but revoking the security clearance of a hostile, politically-driven ex-government official while he/she is voicing incoherent demagoguery on cable news networks regularly is not, never has been, nor ever will be, a legitimate First Amendment issue. Nice try...? #Brennan
