@NYPatriot27 @Annakhait Still waiting for your definition of socialism. Let's see if you can nail it or not then explain to me why you think Democrats are "soshulists".
@NYPatriot27 @Annakhait TIL that kissing the ass of a murderous socialist dictator is "schmoozing".  	FYI: Kim tested more missiles in trump's first year than the entirety of the Obama presidency but I'll bet you forgot about that already.
@NYPatriot27 @Annakhait You guessed my age wrong. No carnival job for you. Tell me, what is a socialist since you seem to have all the answers.
@NYPatriot27 @Annakhait I heard that Obama fell in love with Kim and took his word and Putin's word over the IC's. 	Speaking of political enemies; thoughts on trump directing Cohn to oppose the Time Warner/ ATT merger because of their coverage of him?
@AOC There's a difference between questioning foreign policy and making anti-Semitic slurs. Don't defend her just because you're on the same team. Call out all forms of bigotry.
@NYPatriot27 @Annakhait And yet you support a traitor that bows down to our enemies and abuses the constitution at every turn. Sad!		Also, sent from your Made in China computer. Damn socialist.
@RealCandaceO Psst Candace, the media doesn't give a shit about you, does that make them racist?
@900MonsterDuc @theblaze You're. My 7 year old knows the difference, educationalist.  thanks for proving my point, just like I knew you would.
@900MonsterDuc @theblaze Killing me? Nah, I already know you're an under informed that's incapable of providing facts, just like I said.
@mschlapp @CPAC Cons need their safe spaces.		Of course you didn't address his criticisms though. Thoughts?
@900MonsterDuc @theblaze I knew you'd be incapable of providing examples. Thanks for not disappointing.
@900MonsterDuc @theblaze You did? Ok, name two national emergencies declared under Obama that weren't needed. Let's see if you can be specific (you won't)
@900MonsterDuc @theblaze I'm guessing you haven't looked at the list of national emergencies that Obama declared, "educationalist".
@900MonsterDuc @theblaze "costs money to write and print something" what a moronic comment because writing something is exactly the same as going against the will of congress and diverting billions for a non-existent emergency because he couldn't get Mexico to pay for the wall.
@900MonsterDuc @theblaze Which one of Obama's emergency declarations 1) cost money 2) went against the direct will of Congress? 3) time to change your twitter bio because you clearly don't care about the constitution if your response is "but but but Obama"
@qrayjack @dcexaminer How exactly did they sabotage the summit? 	Maybe if trump didn't threaten Cohen's family he would have testified 4 weeks ago and wouldn't have intersected with the "summit".
@marcorubio @jguaido Glad to see you doing your job and focusing your efforts on the people of Venezuela instead of the problems in Florida.
@tejrichardson @RepMoBrooks @steph93065 If it's mandatory how will trump Org continue to hire undocumented immigrants instead of Americans?
@RepMoBrooks Care to go on record and criticize trump for not using the program so that he can hire undocumented immigrants?
@bellafortunate @ddale8 TBF, he sweated his ass of at CPAC on Sat.
@JakeSherman If trump didn't threaten Cohen's family he would have testified 3 weeks ago, well before the "summit".
@Iamdevinnsmart @RealCandaceO Quite the turn around. Best o' luck with the GOP.		https://t.co/U6tG6ydcDY
@Jim_Jordan No collusion? Explain the trump tower meeting with the KGB lawyer?
@RealCandaceO TIL that PP only performs abortions on black women.
@mschlapp @jack @Twitter Cons are cry babies.
@ddale8 How hot is it in the hall?
@ddale8 How fucking stupid do you have to be to support this jackass?
@ddale8 He's a sweaty bastard.
@NotoriousBob5 @marklevinshow @PatriotParris Is Acosta a meanie to your GEOTUS?  Stay on topic though; Hannity admitted to being a witness and used his show to help trump obstruct justice. FYI: there are fucking tapes between Cohen and trump discussing the payment.
@JohnCornyn "Not on our watch"  Is that a Mussolini quote?
@PatriotParris @NotoriousBob5 @marklevinshow Lied to congress for trump. That's ok, Jr. and Hannity will be cracked like eggs before Congress since they both admitted to being witnesses. #DerpState
@NumbersMuncher Trump - *Screwdriver*
@PatriotParris @NotoriousBob5 @marklevinshow A q-tard in the wild. Backs the blue, doesn't understand that Hannity admitted to being a witness. Think he'll lie under oath for trump?
@AOC If an undocumented immigrant tries to purchase a firearm they should be reported. Don't cry about common sense gun laws, which we desperately need, then complain about common sense gun laws.
@NotoriousBob5 @marklevinshow @PatriotParris Did you just call Hannity a "journalist"? Here's the thing that righties don't seem to get; Hannity admitted to being a witness and put himself at risk of testifying.
@Jasper1166 @WalshFreedom Ask yourself what you would think if Pres. Obama praised the Iranian mullahs while they were negotiating. If you'd be outraged by that you should be outraged by trump's unforgivable actions.
@elpeezey @markknoller @mschlapp @POTUS @nytimes @washingtonpost @nypost @WSJ Only headlines that include "trump"
@blueshot007 @Annakhait Your GEOTUS is the biggest snowflake alive. All he does is whine and complain that people are meanies to him. Sad!
@GrugIV @TheLeadCNN @jaketapper "clarified". What dope believes that?
@jimsciutto And his idiot sheep will believe that "FAKE NEWS!!" misquoted him.
@MattBlackledge5 @StephenGutowski @RightGlockMom @mcmoynihan https://t.co/WN2bz1cHoL
@SexCounseling @seanhannity trump knows how to negotiate? Is that why he was incapable of building a luxury hotel in Moscow and why Mexico isn't paying for the wall?
@seanhannity How much did this photo op and political diversion cost American taxpayers? Well more than $10 million.
@TRONSHOW @marklevinshow trump before the constitution, right?
@big_daddy_boots @FrankLuntz #ThatHappened
@atrupar Deport the anchor baby.
@justinamash You did a fantastic job in questioning Cohen and should be praised by all parties.		Thank you for putting the Constitution before trump and party.
@NotchLickKat @DanCrenshawTX Psst...NOKO is not going to denuke today, tomorrow, or ever. 	But at least trump gave Kim another all expenses paid vacation to commie Vietnam.
@DanCrenshawTX Were you grateful when Pres. Obama did the same with Iran?
@GrahamAllen_1 @realDonaldTrump Unless it's raining.
@AriFleischer Too bad Palestinians don't have that same freedom and were forced from their land. And that's the issue you seem to be avoiding.
@maxwelltani too bad trump can't use his "charity" to buy it.
@RealCandaceO @RalphNortham trump thinks black people are stupid too.
@seanhannity Must not have been raining.
@DanCrenshawTX Hey Dan, do support allowing felons to legally own firearms, you know, so they can protect themselves?
@MollyJongFast Why are you giving these idiots a platform?
@atrupar Did he call out trump org for employing dozens of undocumented immigrants?
@seanhannity Did you kiss his ass on live TV?
@DonaldJTrumpJr I bet you chicken out of testifying, Fredo
@MattBlackledge5 @StephenGutowski @RightGlockMom @mcmoynihan You must be outraged that trump stood in front of violent, America hating Uncle Ho, right?
@OliveBDE @benshapiro @MattWalshBlog Dopes that don't understand the JCPOA and think it gave Iran nukes.
@dcexaminer Remind me again why CBS shelved her?
@SaraCarterDC @FoxNews @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump Maybe if trump didn't threaten Cohen's family he would have testified 3 weeks ago. And yes, it did work.
@seanhannity @jsolomonReports Client #3 weighs in.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Ok. Offer to testify before the House Oversight cmte.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Are you saying that Meadows isn't racist?		https://t.co/1NOMu0Qj4w
@block215 @CBSEveningNews Glad to see you admire this guy.  		https://t.co/1NOMu0Qj4w
@62jerseygirl @FrankLuntz You'd be able to find more if trump didn't kick reporters out of the meeting.
@JohnCGoya @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Uncle Ho killed thousands of Americans, how many did Che kill? Trump was showed (huh?) he was in Vietnam to help The Kims.
@Stella_Basham1 @jeffmason1 @POTUS And conservatives attacked Obama for it so you must be equally outraged that trump is doing worse by praising Kim, right?
@LindseyGrahamSC Not the subject of today's hearing. Did Burr ask it yesterday? Maybe rat Nunes can ask it tomorrow for you.
@Jim_Jordan Not shocking that you looked like an idiot and Cohen owned you.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Just because you wear knee pads for trump doesn't mean the dems have to.
@kaitlancollins Stop covering him. Stop giving him the attention he so desperately craves.
@ForAmerica That time when trump went to Vietnam (about time) and posed in front of a giant mural of Uncle Ho https://t.co/U7vyRJUwUU
@TheresaMartens @FoxNews @SenJohnMcCain @POTUS https://t.co/TML9LFVmMw
@MarkSKrikorian https://t.co/KVp9GNwDjF
@robbystarbuck trump went to Vietnam 	• Posed in front of a memorial of Uncle Ho + normalized the Kims 	• nuclear weapons being developed 	• Activists/Reporters arrested during Vietnam trip 	• He'll remove sanctions for nothing https://t.co/Ht6H8HvcTJ
@Glassdragon7 @KatiePavlich He fell in love with Kim too! https://t.co/DN5rJizuOG

@LunalNewport @thehill Add this to your collection https://t.co/5qtcCb99ib
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump We'll remember this when you're outraged at the next Dem president for abuse of power.
@TracyJeffords Obama didn't fall in love with Castro. 		So glad Kim decided to destroy the one site that already imploded while he continues to build up his arsenal.
@FavoriteGoat Imagine being so gullible and stupid to think he posed in front of a Che portrait (it was 1000' behind them across a road and plaza).		https://t.co/Bhs5vvZtHL
@TheresaMartens @FoxNews @SenJohnMcCain @POTUS Man, you must be pissed about trump kissing up to Kim in Vietnam (in front of Uncle Ho)
@JamesAGagliano You mean the Che that was 1000 feet behind him while he was honoring Jose Marti.  Yeah, totes the same thing...to dopes.		https://t.co/Bhs5vvZtHL
@TheRickWilson @mattgaetz When was the last time Matt spoke with trump?
@mattgaetz @Twitter Hey jackass, he violated twitter's terms of service by creating fake accounts. He admitted to it.
@seanhannity Danny was held for 18 months? How many rounds of golf did trump play in that time?
@ddale8 Isn't that a U turn?
@narcissist_ghst @charliekirk11 You mean like trump is doing it for you? LOL
@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump Shocking that you're a hypocrite.		https://t.co/5CaO29f3AH
@NatureEcho_ @thor_benson @realDonaldTrump If it comes from a foreign, state, or local government it most certainly is. It's also a conflict of interest.
@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump That's adorable that you think that trump isn't a globalist.
@realDonaldTrump A tweet for every occasion;		https://t.co/chxJKZmeuc
He snuck one in last Monday. Shocked he didn't head down to FL this passed weekend to "prep" for his meeting with Kim.		Sources: 	https://t.co/7lCJQcJhpm    	https://t.co/6V9Igtkj8S https://t.co/gfUyZISTB5
@FrankLuntz trump will claim the crowd as his own.
@RyanAPriddle @marklevinshow Let me see if I got your logic straight; there are killers out there so we shouldn't worry about locking up white collar fraudsters?
@marklevinshow Look at lil' Levin defend a criminal. Pathetic.
@Andrew36211974 @breakfastislife @benshapiro Do you need a Russian translation of the WaPo article to see that Mueller isn't mentioned? That'd be Acosta, a former prosecutor, member of the DOJ, whose boss was AG Ashcroft (aka not the FBI director). 	You're welcome for the US civics 101 lesson, 36211974.
@Andrew36211974 @breakfastislife @benshapiro Where's your proof he signed off on it, 36211974?
@Andrew36211974 @breakfastislife @benshapiro Dude, I don't think u understand that the FBI doesn't have shit to do with plea deals, that'd be the AG &amp; DOJ. Civics 101. But since you made the claim he "signed off" on the deal I'm assuming you have actual proof, right? Doubtful. Conspiracy theorists can never back up their BS
@Andrew36211974 @breakfastislife @benshapiro TIL that a random tweet is "fact" that Mueller "signed off" on the deal. Where's your source? Of course you're spewing bullshit.
@markzachary10 @marklevinshow Great point. So trump did condemn the white supremacist? Got a link to the condemnation?
@marklevinshow You failed to address Steele's point that trump didn't condemn him, "you idiot"! trump has no problem condemning others but "both sides" white supremacists.
@Andrew36211974 @breakfastislife @benshapiro Cite your facts that he signed off on the deal.
@Andrew36211974 @breakfastislife @benshapiro Good lord you people are stupid. Since when does the FBI negotiate plea deals with criminals?
@SexCounseling @marklevinshow Is that why trump didn't release his?
@Seberace @marklevinshow Plus Super PACs, which he "disavowed".		https://t.co/ZXiv0RfUtf
@Seberace @marklevinshow He takes a salary. He might donate it but he still takes it. If he donates to charity that's a tax write off.	Took no money for his campaign? $132,000,000 in donations. Only a fool thinks he was "self funding".		https://t.co/i3xKogpogv
@ctxb23 She's an American so she has them. End of story. Mark my words, she'll be allowed back and will be charged. 	Have a good one.
@USAirPilot80 @ctxb23 @denise_kandra @seanhannity There's a formal process of renouncing your citizenship if she did that then State will have the documentation.

@ctxb23 thank you for admitting you couldn't care less about constitutional rights/ protections.
@USAirPilot80 @ctxb23 @denise_kandra @seanhannity Alabama which is definitely not a US territory in the Pacific.
@ctxb23 @USAirPilot80 @denise_kandra @seanhannity don't confuse me thinking that she should be afforded constitutional rights/protections with thinking she shouldn't be prosecuted because that's a moronic argument and leap of "logic".
@ctxb23 @USAirPilot80 @denise_kandra @seanhannity Yeah, shame on me for wanting constitutional  protections for all Americans. Let me guess, you claim to love our flag and constitution yet here you are not wanting constitutional rights/protections for ALL Americans.

@ctxb23 @USAirPilot80 @denise_kandra @seanhannity So she was born in American Samoa or Swains Island and not Alabama? Maybe you should read your links and research what a "non-citizen national" is before you continue to embarrass yourself, k?
@ctxb23 @USAirPilot80 @denise_kandra @seanhannity Anyone huh? Did you bother to read the link? I'm guessing not since it clearly defines who can apply.

@TrueFactsStated Losing the farm to own the libs!
@ctxb23 @seanhannity If she's not an American citizen how was she issued a US passport? Bring her home and prosecute her for her crimes.

@ssssss22 @JamesAGagliano No Americans because it's prohibited which was my point. Sorry that I had to clear up that it was a rhetorical question for you.
@JamesAGagliano @ssssss22 Any Americans being held at GITMO right now? I'd say it's a clear constitutional violation.

@wtucker956 @FrankLuntz then you thought wrong, Terry. There is no official language in the US.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Explain Jr, Manafort, and Kushner meeting with a KGB lawyer in trump tower.
@ddale8 2.5 years ago they said they'd have a press briefing on Third Lady Melanie's immigration history in 2 weeks.

@dmartosko Joe and Mika were literally joining trump for meals at Sea to Lake. Same with Hannity. How about you wait to see what their reporting is like.
@BernieMalabanan @RepMattGaetz @BarackObama I'm glad you're copacetic with a president wasting nearly a $100m on personal travel (in 2 years), I await your outrage when the next Dem does it (just like trump.		#NoCureForHypocrisy
@BernieMalabanan @RepMattGaetz @BarackObama Send this to trump, he clearly needs it more than I do. But wait until he finishes his emergency round of golf.
@BernieMalabanan @RepMattGaetz @BarackObama I see, so when trump says the same shit it's genius, right? 		#NoCureForHypocrisy
@BernieMalabanan @RepMattGaetz @BarackObama What's that hashtag?		Oh , yeah  #NoCureForStupidity
@BernieMalabanan @RepMattGaetz @BarackObama I know, right? What kind of idiot thinks that the President needs to be in DC during an emergency? Thanks for walking into the face first.		https://t.co/oh17vIO1qP
@BernieMalabanan @RepMattGaetz Is the WH on the border? You think he should be playing golf and grifting right after he declared a national emergency? SMDH
@GOPChairwoman So you're opposed to subsidies for coal and petroleum too? Or you cool with that "socialism"?
@RepMattGaetz If there's a national emergency then why is trump spending the weekend golfing instead of in the WH where a POTUS* should be during an emergency?
@RL9631 Can you name a single national emergency declared by Obama or Clinton that went against the will of Congress?
@TheRickWilson Glad to see he can get in a round before his normal starting work time.
@JosephMeliambro @shimmo23 Like flying off to Florida for golf after declaring a national emergency? Those kind of optics?
@JosephMeliambro @realDonaldTrump I can't wait to see what you have to say about trump frolicking with commie Kim in commie Vietnam at the end of the month.
@djholzem @realDonaldTrump 5 dead yesterday and trump is celebrating with a round of golf. Fore!
@jiveDurkey Glad to see he can get up and at 'em for golf but not work at the WH.
@MAGAVoter @smashmouth So why is trump working on his golf game instead of being in the WH (mission control) right after he declared a national emergency.  In emergency a leader doesn't lead by twitter.
@TWTWsports @realDonaldTrump Man, you must be irate that trump is planning to meet commie Kim in commie Vietnam later this month, right?
@Acosta And trump is in Florida for yet another golf weekend.
@ddale8 golfing during a national emergency. Apt.
@IAmNickReynolds Didn't Jesus supposedly die for OUR sins so that should mean getting rid of the death penalty, right?
@MeetThePress @chucktodd @MSNBC If it's a national emergency why does trump Org employ so many undocumented immigrants and why is he going golfing and grifting in Florida (his 20th trip) this weekend?
@seanhannity Hey Hannity, remember this when a Democrat declares a national emergency over gun deaths, climate change, health care.		Some emergency, he's going golfing for the weekend. Pathetic.
@AndrewPollackFL @realDonaldTrump Dem policies were responsible for her death? You're slightly retarded.
@ddale8 So declare a "national emergency" then head south for a "working" golf weekend?
@spawn9658 @Acosta There's always tomorrow.
@MarkGrote @JonahNRO @BarbraStreisand @HowardSchultz Just remember that when a Democrat does the same thing in 2021.
@SaraCarterDC When do you plan on investigating all the trump properties that were employing undocumented immigrants?
@Acosta Hey Jim, why aren't you asking the WH comm's team about trump Org employing dozens of undocumented immigrants?
@seanhannity Must be a YUGE national emergency if trump plans on heading to Florida for yet another golf weekend. Remember when you RWNJs hated that Obama golfed occasionally? Where's your outrage now?
@taz_didier @Annakhait Don't ask Anna to understand science, it's too difficult for her to grasp.
trump to declare a #NationalEmergency then head to Florida for a golfing weekend and to check up on his undocumented employees at his clubs.
@maggieNYT Must be planning on going to Florida this weekend and doesn't want to cancel.
@IngrahamAngle @RaymondArroyo Wow! conrats to trump for having a bigger crowd than a former congressman. What an accomplishment. So proud.
@Bennettruth @markknoller @POTUS Are you upset about the debt that trump has added or you only plan on complaining about Obama?
@jdawsey1 Stop covering his rallies. He thrives on the attention so starve him.
@FoutzJames @a11i50n8 @seanhannity Like trump saying to take the guns and worry about due process later? Or how he's violating the Emoluments Clauses? That contrary to the Constitution and our Bill of Rights?

@MissingReagan You mean the same democrats that are fighting to remove symbols of racism and treason and republicans are defending, fool?
@MissingReagan @Pete2303 @GOPChairwoman Good people on both sides. Both sides. 		Who the fuck do you think was on the side of the KKK, white supremacists, etc...
@GOPChairwoman How is the BDS movement anti-Semitic? 		Maybe take a look at what Kevin McCarthy had to say about prominent Jews!
@RealCandaceO @TheDemocrats Have you denounced trump's socialist bail out of farmers that he fucked over?
@CharlesBeris @realDonaldTrump Can you let trump know that he can stop campaigning now (rally in El Paso today) and do the job of President! Thanks.

@brithume Look at you trying to dismiss trump's racism.		Pathetic.
@TheRightMelissa @lsor8 @Specterphone @realDonaldTrump Damn, you must be pissed at all the illegal immigrants that trump Org. employed, right? Nah, you're a fucking hypocrite too.
@realDonaldTrump You must a secret commie if you're holding this "summit" in Vietnam or are you planning on checking out where they make some of your junk products?
@NBCNightlyNews I'm shocked that trump paid them.
@SenTomCotton Arkansas can take care of the fire itself, you don't deserve our tax dollars for a state issue.

@chris08018 @thehill Look at you defend the Nazi lover. Low energy!
@FaceTheNation @realDonaldTrump How the hell does he have massive bags under his eyes when he's literally doing nothing all day?
@chris08018 @thehill Were there Nazis, white supremacists, and the KKK on one side or not? I'll wait while you make up a strawman argument to defend your GEOTUS.
@chris08018 @thehill Did he say there are good people on both sides? Were there Nazis on one of those sides? Quit defending the indefensible.
@kylegriffin1 He doesn't care if those uppity negros get the brain damage.
@thehill Also trump: Nazis are good people!
Weekly Update (2/3/19)	Another shutdown is looming and trump is on his 19th trip to Sea to Lake, Florida.	What a hard worker!		Sources: 	https://t.co/7lCJQcJhpm  	https://t.co/6V9Igtkj8S https://t.co/B4auxajPHo
@thehill Is being an obese pig the result of good genes too?
@RealJamesWoods And?
@realDonaldTrump You said Nazis were very good people then tried to walk it back 2 days later only to reaffirm your bigotry a day or two later.
@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump @jacknicklaus @TigerWoods Hey hypocrite, remember when you were outraged by a president golfing? The internet does.		https://t.co/6bcTr5RNbe
@chuckwoolery Remember when you complained about Obama golfing with Tiger? Hypocrite!		https://t.co/ZRps9Dm4O9
@MarkYoungTruth US murder rate is 4x higher than France's.		You're welcome.
@JohnCornyn Hey Senator, give us your definition of socialism. thanks.
@thehill Not for lack of trying to steal from American taxpayers. 		FYI: he's golfing in Florida, his 19th trip, at taxpayer expense.
@KatrinaPierson Go steal another jacket because political history is not your forte. 	Northern Liberals got rid of slavery, Southern Conservatives fought it tooth and nail.
@asareuben @IngrahamAngle What about it?
@Kurtpimentel @markknoller Wow. what a sacrifice staying in DC to oversee the mess he created.
@GOP 76% of that was Obama.		Thanks, @BarackObama !
@tjmac48 @markknoller Yeah..."working". He literally did next to nothing this week unless you count tweeting and watching TV work.
@Kurtpimentel @markknoller Yeah, poor guy never gets to leave DC ... as he makes his 19th taxpayer funded trip to Florida.
@SaraCarterDC I thought that you guys don't trust anonymous sources?
@RepMattGaetz @FoxNews Is that really the best pic your staff could find? 		Glad to see you have no issue with perjury. Strange that all these people keep lying about their Russian contacts. Might be a pattern there.
@ddale8 Capt. Bone Spurs attacking others that actually served.
@kaitlancollins Nobody knows guns better than trump!!
@KatrinaPierson Items you plan on shoplifting?
@RepMattGaetz @TuckerCarlson You have ZERO idea about his investigation.
@pickettlnl @SaraCarterDC @henryrodgersdc You love all life? I'm guessing you fully support bringing in refugees that are escaping inexplicable violence, right?
@SaraCarterDC @henryrodgersdc I'm still waiting for you to call out the Liar in Chief. Any day now.
@xjippyx @Annakhait @RetardRival @realDonaldTrump I think you meant "works". He's literally done jack shit this week and tomorrow he's heading to FL for a weekend of golfing and grifting or as Anna so ignorantly believes "working for free"		https://t.co/TohExfGJEy
@SaraCarterDC @IngrahamAngle @TimBBallard You going to talk about trump Org. employing dozens of undocumented immigrants and even helping provided the papers?
@pricklylogic @PageSix Fire any politician that can't be bothered to remain in DC to negotiate. Agreed?
@mrsg_who @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @NBCNews @CNN I agree 100%. Any politician that leaves DC to hobnob with the rich before there is a deal needs to be fired. Agreed?
@seaypa @realDonaldTrump Make sure that trump flied commercial to Florida this weekend.	Save taxpayers' money.
@cinarte1956 @PageSix How much is it going to cost us for trump to travel to Florida this weekend for golf, grifting, and a Super Bowl party?
@DanaBordeaux Great point, Dana. Anyone the leaves DC before there is a deal should be fired, agreed?
@mjr1900_rl @mitchellvii Man, you must be pissed that trump is going golfing this weekend in Florida instead of working, right?
@CFusaro13 @SpeakerPelosi She doesn't support American citizens because she'll be at the Grammys?
@steph93065 @AaronBlake Probably there is less enforcement in certain areas because it's not necessary. Just a thought.
@AaronBlake It's as if you know trump is a predictable shithead.		https://t.co/EkqjKZRFW9

@gatewaypundit @AOC Jim really doesn't want to relinquish  his "Dumbest Person on the Internet" title just yet.

@ddale8 laziest mofo to ever live in the WH.
@archi1210 @nypost FYI: Nancy has a house in California so that's a moronic defense of trump.
@archi1210 @nypost House? It's a business that charges $200k fee to join but go ahead and think that's not the elite. trump supporters really are bottom of the barrel stupid. #smh 		Thanks for admitting you're a hypocrite.
@DrJillStein @NateSilver538 Honestly, how stupid do you have to be to vote for someone that came in 2nd place in her town election?
@IngaZorin111 Hypocrites say what?
@KamVTV Damn, you must be pissed that trump is heading to Florida for golf and grifting instead of staying in D.C. and working to secure the border, right?
@archi1210 @nypost I bet you're pissed that elite trump is heading to Florida for the weekend instead of working for his people, right?
@patriotic_tom @SpeakerPelosi @PageSix Will you blame trump because he'll be in Florida this weekend instead of DC?
@IngaZorin111 trump is attending Sea to Lake this weekend. Cost to taxpayers? $3million
@HappenShitDoes @PageSix Not Shocked! He Has His Prioritie Screwed Up!!🔴🔴 trump to attend Mar a Lago this weekend.. Thoughts?
@kenzie45230 @BreitbartNews Hi 45230, what are your thoughts on trump hobnobbing at Sea to Lake this weekend?
@KathyHier @joelconnelly @GOP He's heading to Florida this weekend. Proof he doesn't care about Americans (he hires more foreigners and undocumented immigrants than actual Americans) Sad!		https://t.co/ZaMaKhEiOB
@KFerrugia @SebGorka @ArizonaKayte I see. Pelosi is off to the Grammys next weekend so that means she doesn't care but trump is off to golf and grifting with Sea to Lake members but he DOES care. 	Don't you hate being a hypocrite and not having core beliefs? 	thoughts on trump hiring illegal immigrants?
@KFerrugia @SebGorka @ArizonaKayte If you're outraged she's going to CA before negotiations are complete  then you should be equally outraged trump is going to FL for the weekend  for golf and grifting FYI: he doesn't give a damn about you either, that's why his company  hired illegal immigrants and hid it.
@KFerrugia @SebGorka @ArizonaKayte Yeah, that's what I thought, hypocrite.
@USAMP05_RET @markknoller ThAt'S NoT WhAt He MeAnT!!!		https://t.co/9eRQWspbP3
@KFerrugia @SebGorka @ArizonaKayte You outraged that trump is heading to Florida for the weekend for golf and Super Bowl viewing party?

@LindseyGrahamSC Why weren't they nicer to the guy they charged with 7 felonies?  What a dope!
@RepMattGaetz Hey Matt, you pissed that trump is heading to Sea to Lake this weekend instead of remaining in DC?
@marcorubio Rubio is a fascist.
@josh_hammer education! quality of life!
@aroberts3016 @Annakhait @RSutton57 Thoughts on Little Italys and Chinatowns? Being "American" doesn't mean you have to assimilate into white culture. My wife is from Central America and she has zero urge to spend our dinner dates at TGIFriday or speaking English if she doesn't want. And guess what, you'll be fine!
@aroberts3016 @Annakhait @RSutton57 Claims to be a student of history, fails to realize how Irish immigrants were treated when they "legally" immigrated to the US. What are your thoughts on Chinatowns and Little Italys?
@JordanUhl It's working out well for Saudi Arabia  and other Middle Eastern kingdoms. Why should the elite be the only ones to benefit from our natural resources?
@Fahrenthold That's convenient.  Why hasn't ICE raided all trump Org properties?
@aroberts3016 @Annakhait @RSutton57 I know, right? That's why we don't have Little Italys, Chinatowns, Koreatowns, etc...	Don't worry, you won't be negatively affected by someone deciding not to shop at Walmart and dining at TGIFridays.
@badbrad1169 @Jim_Jordan Ok, but you're still wrong because most (not some) states try minors as adults.
@badbrad1169 @Jim_Jordan All states allow juveniles  to be tried as adult depending on the crime. 		https://t.co/eEjI4HOo5U
@Douglas61866012 @Jim_Jordan My grammy is just as vulnerable to manipulation from Fox News. We shouldn't let people over 70 vote because their cognitive processes are diminished.
@badbrad1169 @Jim_Jordan Good thing they can already go to jail like an adult and buy guns.
@ThinkrEdible @GOPChairwoman @Liberty4Rox So what are your thought on trump heading to Florida this weekend for golf and his Super Bowl party?
@MarALagoComedy @GOPChairwoman @GOP @realDonaldTrump 121? That's fake news. It's over 150 and he's heading there this weekend for his Super Bowl party.
@GOPChairwoman And trump is headed to Florida for the weekend, why isn't he staying to negotiate?
@RealCandaceO That's a lot of white folks for a #Blexit!
@RepMarkMeadows What are your thoughts about the trump Tower meeting with JR, Kushner, and Manafort?
@StuPolitics We'll get Mexico to pay for it.
@seanhannity oh oh oh let me guess, HILLARY!!! and her emails.
@MadMaxineMax1 @seanhannity Yeah, it means it's easier to own and carry a firearm in DC.
@MadMaxineMax1 @seanhannity except that some of their strictest gun laws were overturned.
@jessejames3ball @Annakhait How were the primaries "rigged" against him? Clinton won a majority of the pledged delegates and 3.5 million more votes than Sanders.
@maggieNYT Yeah, I'm sure that US attorney Christie would have accepted that excuse and dismissed charges.
@gojirademonstah @HouseOfMichele @mitchellvii Has this douche ever made a correct prediction?
@mehdirhasan HeS CoMmUnICaTiNg WiTh Q!!!
@jimsciutto ICE and the IRS need to raid all of Trump's properties and seize all employment documents.
@Fahrenthold @realDonaldTrump Why hasn't ICE or the IRS raided the business to seize documents?
@GovMikeHuckabee Jesus would be so proud of your lies.
@CNNSitRoom Is "prorated" Spanish for  "Mexico won't pay for the wall"?
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Yeah, that's another trump bullshit lie.		https://t.co/UMTy7VkLiT
@BradMossEsq Giuliani is what happens when you're a deadbeat liar that refuses to listen to counsel.
@DansMonkeyShack @Annakhait @KsKM3 @NostrADAMusly Don't give Anna too many facts or she'll block you. 		I'm willing to bet that Miss Khait wasn't paying attention too closely during science class if she thinks we evolved from monkeys.
@justint2012 @earlgreyhottea @TomiLahren This is way out of the norm. How many personal trips do you think trump has made to Florida and NJ?
@Ronnie_D_Lynch @GilmerKinnard @TomiLahren @Marcie_Wick Get Mexico to front the pesos like trump promised.
@john_wallek @TomiLahren Who forced her to go to sea to lake during the shutdown?
@dvldocvetLAV25 @marymagill @seanhannity Great. So the next Dem in office that can't get common sense gun laws passed will declare a national emergency and you'll be cool with it, right?
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Why isn't he on the phone with Obrador begging for the pesos that trump promised would pay for the wall?
@frankr1103 @Annakhait I see. So you think that there are exemptions to being "pro-life", right? You're either all pro-life or you're not, there's no middle ground. So, are you in favor of helping those fleeing CA and Syria or are you pro-death?
@frankr1103 @Annakhait Great. So you're in favor of helping people flee Central America and Syria!
@Duster399 @DailyCaller @ctlnmcfall пожалуйста!
@realDonaldTrump Then stop importing foreign temp workers for your money laundering properties and hire Americans instead.
@DailyCaller @ctlnmcfall Shouldn't cost American tax payers one penny since he promised Mexico would pay for it.
@WalshFreedom @foxandfriends Shannon Bream just spent an entire 30 seconds on it.
@iamkristaleigh @NumbersMuncher Leak didn't come from Mueller.
@benshapiro Did trump do your makeup tonight? You look like a little pumpkin.
@ComfortablySmug Yeah, except Obama never said that to Putin. Basic facts.
@GreggJarrett trump watched underage prostitutes urinate on a bed in Moscow.
@CharlieVTX @JakeSherman TBF, that's when trump flies not the Third Lady. This flight is probably a couple hundred thousand.
@SavvDaddy @WhosePolitics @JakeSherman So you're upset that Melanie is wasting taxpayer money too, right?
@SavvDaddy @JakeSherman That's your defense of this wasteful spending? but but but the dems??
@SavvDaddy @JakeSherman Third Lady Melanie is going on an expensive vacation while 800k aren't getting paid.
@seanhannity Pelosi has bigger balls than that pussy trump who would never visit Afghanistan.
@PetersforSenate @davitydave @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi Vacation?
@atrupar trump was not involved with the trump campaign! ~ Rudy G.
@benshapiro Yeah, you're peak masculinity.
@DuesterCarl Just a heads up, you don't have a First Amendment right to a twitter account. I've been blocked by many conservatives so don't you do it otherwise that makes you a hypocrite and a fascist.
@DuesterCarl @sine1961 @rsmith7964 @RepMarkMeadows @TheDemocrats @shutdown @SenSchumer @GOP I legit can't tell if you're trolling or dumb.
@waybaby @marklevinshow Then why did he demand US taxpayer money and shutdown the government if "Mexico WILL pay for the wall"? Do you like being treated like a sucker?
@marklevinshow He already budged. He promised scores of times that Mexico would pay for the wall not that he would shut down the US government unless Democrats paid for his 2020 campaign promise.
@sabine_durden @Love_Trumps_All @penvan83 You must be outraged that trump's golf course not only hired undocumented immigrants but gave them fake documents, right?
@NiallStanage Why bother? He'll just use it as a photo op and walk out to enjoy some cold hamberders.
@Maccagnano_Life Why is it that republicans have no idea about the constitution? 	There is no presidential pardon for impeachment and conviction. 	Article II. Sect. 2		You're welcome.
@PhilipRucker Are they covering it on Fox News?
@SteveKingIA You don't have a constitutional right to a committee seat, ya dope.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @DailyCaller I thought you dopes hated anonymous sources?
This is what happens when you present cowardly conservatives with actual facts. They can't engage in informed debate so they shut it off and then claim they "owned the libs". Sad! https://t.co/hWQPzS9wp4
@Annakhait This is what happens when you present cowardly conservatives with actual facts. They can't engage in informed debate so they shut it off and then claim they "owned the libs". Sad! https://t.co/uBgvNHjb2L
@Annakhait This is what happens when you present cowardly conservatives with actual facts. Sad! https://t.co/eTsFSseuuv
@Annakhait Yes. Are you or will you make excuses even there's documented evidence  trump committed crimes? What would be the straw that breaks your support for trump? He's literally the least Christian individual to ever occupy the Oval Office, that should mean something to a Christian.
@Annakhait Not all refugees petition for asylum. You're welcome. 		Your family emigrated from the Soviet Union, right? What essential skills did they bring to the US? You got yours though. Congrats. 		Thanks for inadvertently admitting the Holy Family were refugees though.
@Annakhait Are you willing to accept his conclusions no matter what?
So, do you think American Christians would welcome a brown middle easterner or Mexican Savior into the US or would they reject him?
I have. Clearly you haven't. 		Matthew 2: 13-23. 		You're welcome. https://t.co/HyMdAtEtWv
@Annakhait Hey Anna, Jesus was a refugee, do you think that American Christians would invite him in today?
@KayaJones @realDonaldTrump You have to be a gullible sheep (trump supporter) to believe that BS story.
@DailyCaller Agreed. Prosecute the FBI agents that were leaking to Giuliani during the election.
@KatrinaPierson Giving Syria to Russia. So tough.
@RealCandaceO @AOC Yeah, that's a moronic statement. 	You support a guy that was $1B in debt and bankrupted 3 casinos.
@ErinLeanne7 @HarveyWolney @bebebovay @Franklin_Graham Get Mexico to pay for it.
@Gail_Myers1 @Franklin_Graham Which compromise did trump offer?
@kentuckylady717 @Franklin_Graham Military members are getting their paychecks. Put it on trump. Senate agreed to a budget and trump rejected it because they wouldn't fund the wall he promised Mexico would pay for.
@MarkSimoneNY Almost as if you're intentionally misleading or most likely lying by misquoting the line:		"No evidence has emerged PUBLICLY that Mr. Trump was secretly in contact with or took direction from Russian government officials."		You omitted a key word.
@SenatorSinema Were you honored to cast your first Senate vote against the 1st Amendment?
@realDonaldTrump Do you get pleasure in repeating the same shit over and over again? 		You're definitely on the spectrum. No wonder  you're anti-vax
@CBSNews Which ever idiot at NBC thought giving bigot Kelly a $69M contract was a good business decision should be ass kicked out of the building. She was always going to be a disaster.
@RepMarkMeadows Bookmarking this tweet for when you complain about the next Dem president abusing authority.
@ByronYork You're going to look real foolish in a couple of years for your full throated defense of trump.
@VictorFreely @SecNielsen Illegal border crossing might decrease but that's not what I said, use of coyotes and traffickers will increase. 		Entiendes?
@VictorFreely @SecNielsen A wall means that people seeking to get into the US are even more dependent on coyotes and traffickers.
@SecNielsen Psst...a wall will make human trafficking even worse but you already know that.
@SheForest @patrickbec @RichLowry Suck it up, snowflake.
@patrickbec @RichLowry trUmP SaYs WhAt He MeAnS!!!		also:		ThAt'S NoT WhAt He MeAnT!!!		Yeah, trump sarcastically defended his "joke". trump supporters really are that stupid.
@BuckSexton That's quite the spin.
@JordanUhl That's 45 seconds more than Hannity will talk about the investigation.
@DeborahThrasher @seanhannity Jesus would be so proud of you for your utter lack of compassion.
@patrickbec @RichLowry If it was a joke why did he defend the comment when Katy Tur asked him if he was serious?
@RichLowry Then why did he defend the comment when pressed by Katy Tur?
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump trump rejected your budget deal but go ahead and blame the Dems, cuck!
@MrDanZak trump is clearly eyeing that bag of cash. Check his pockets.
@lucarp2 @MichaelCohen212 Pretty sure that Cohen knowingly taped the conversation.
@realDonaldTrump Stop watching so much TV you lazy effing bum.
@realDonaldTrump Hey jackass, they don't owe you fidelity.
@JohnCornyn Hey Cornyn, did you swear an oath to trump or to uphold the constitution?
@Annakhait @SpeakerPelosi Any thoughts?
Funny, I only see those on Fox News.
@WhiteHouse ¿Mexican democrats?
@theblaze More likely than past presidents telling trump to build the wall. 	Or grown men crying when talking to trump in private.
@Annakhait @SpeakerPelosi Also:		https://t.co/1VvQATgYjK
@Annakhait @SpeakerPelosi I'm SHOCKED that Fox News hasn't covered this. SHOCKED.		https://t.co/XjKNhuUqky
@Annakhait @SpeakerPelosi Hey Anna, if undocumented immigrants are so bad why does trump employ them at his NJ golf course (most likely his other properties too)?
@jungcoconutjoon @nowthisnews Don't be naive. RW media won't report on this so the sheep will never know.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Your family financially benefits from illegal immigration.
@SenTomCotton How come Trump hasn't negotiated his release yet? Y'all attacked Obama when they did this during his presidency, where's the consistency?
@JackPosobiec cocaine and heroin are heavily processed before you're able to consume it. How about marijuana?
@BreitbartNews Free market, biatch.
@smerconish @realDonaldTrump Put it on a 5 minute delay and fact check in real time.
@GodBlessUSA316 @thehill Get Mexico to pay for the wall.
@TraderOfFutures tell that to all the living felons in Florida that are citizens and have ID.
@AriFleischer Great solution. We'll do it after trump gets the pesos from Mexico.
@Whiteseraph86 @JackPosobiec Care to explain how it's the "same concept"?
@JackPosobiec I'm sure you would have said the same if Obama had pulled some crazy shit too, right "rape Melania"?
@ddale8 WTF is he still talking about the 2016 election?
@JeffTapia13 @Garland2018 @axios @TwitterSafety yeah, except you haven't provided any data.		Like trump says: he loves the uneducated! congrats.
@JeffTapia13 @Garland2018 @axios @TwitterSafety Ciao, retardado!
@JeffTapia13 @Garland2018 @axios @TwitterSafety Again, so fully retarded! 		What part of "a direct link to the DHS data" are you having problems comprehending? Do you need a Russian translation?
@JeffTapia13 @Garland2018 @axios @TwitterSafety No, what I want is for you to give me a direct link to the DHS data. I've already said that you won't so prove me wrong
@JeffTapia13 @axios How about a direct link to that moronic claim instead of linking to the dhs website.
@JeffTapia13 @grimmrad @axios Great. So link the DHS report about the 2000 homicides. I bet you don't.
@JeffTapia13 @axios Then provide verifiable facts to back up that absurd claim and no, your moronic link to a blog isn't valid. Did you bother clicking any of the hyper links or are you trying to funnel business to you tix resale business?	Literally  no facts on your stupid link.
@KellyO Still a wall. Maybe (definitely) his supporters are that stupid but Dems won't fall for it.
@JeffTapia13 @grimmrad @axios So fully! 	Are you saying that illegal immigrants kill 11,000 Americans each and every year? Provide actual data and not some shitty blog and we'll have a discussion.
@JeffTapia13 @axios Are you partially or fully retarded?
@KayaJones What's the issue?
@axios trump is that stupid that he thinks that Dems can't see through his bullshit. It's still a barrier.
@Gillyking @IngrahamAngle @wolfblitzer They should make a deal with trump that when Mexico pays for the wall he can have it.
@IngrahamAngle Strange that you'd mention construction and hospitality being afected since trump is known to hire undocumented immigrants instead of paying Americans a decent wage.
@Beth2002 @IngrahamAngle Sure you did.
@RobertCairo1 @Darrylastin1 @seanhannity Only a dope would think that the perpetual conman is a great president. Congrats on being that dope.
@RobertCairo1 @Darrylastin1 @seanhannity Explain how the Cabinet was responsible for the tax cut (thanks for admitting it wasn't "reform"). trump inherited a low unemployment rate. Thanks, Obama! Fewer jobs created in trump's first two years than Obama's last 2. Thanks, Obama!	Stop watching Hannity to get your "facts"
@yodermaker @AndrewCMcCarthy @NRO What has the left lied about "all of it"?
@RobertCairo1 @Darrylastin1 @seanhannity LOL.	Name one thing they have done to deserve the raise. Thanks.
@MarkDice no you won't
@Fitzyleelee @NBCNews Did he do this to force Mexico to pay for the wall?	https://t.co/kdBTeZ8Ffz
@Fitzyleelee @NBCNews I see. You're one of the morons that thinks trump's NAFTA 1.0.1 somehow pays for the wall. Damn, he does have the dumbest supporters.
@combonation6861 @msgtdubbya @AngeleStar11 This is her country, moron.
@AngeleStar11 @msgtdubbya @ambinc1 I bet you claim to love the constitution and free speech.
@Fitzyleelee @NBCNews Like telling the rubes that Mexico would pay for the wall then closing the gubmint because Congress won't give him taxpayer dollars for the Mexican wall? Yup, anything for votes.
@jasonahart Yes, it's all the media's fault that republicans don't elect women. Good lord.
@DailyCaller I'd be embarrassed to be that stupid, trump revels in his stupidity. 		Does trump think that a few traffic barriers = wall?		https://t.co/XtnjamVqVo
@bpolitics Don't worry, when prices increase he'll blame "Chuck and Nancy".
@DailyCaller Let's see who comments before reading.
@VinceGottalotta @Corsair9605 @BreitbartNews Congrats on being so retarded. Your mother/ sister must be so proud.
@VinceGottalotta @Corsair9605 @BreitbartNews Are RWNJs so retarded that they don't know the difference between "renew" and "renegotiate"? 		Who negotiated the SOFA in 2008 and explain how that's Obama's fault? Thanks.
@VinceGottalotta @Corsair9605 @BreitbartNews there was no "renewing" SOFA, dope. 		I'm sure you're just as outraged that Trump is "cutting and running" from Syria (but this is all on him), right?		Seriously, you RWNJs are fucking brain dead blaming Obama for Bush's war and inability to negotiate a stay behind force.
@ScottWalker WI taxpayers are on the hook for your crony capitalism with Foxconn. Well done.
@VinceGottalotta @Corsair9605 @BreitbartNews Gross incompetence in renewing the SOFA with Iraq?		When did the SOFA expire? 		This should be good.
@VinceGottalotta @Corsair9605 @BreitbartNews Hmmm, only a retard like you would assume that I expected Iraq to agree to indefinite occupation but that wasn't my original point.	Explain why Bush didn't negotiate a stay behind force in the SOFA and why RW idiots like you  are blaming Obama for Bush's failure. Thanks!
@VinceGottalotta @Corsair9605 @BreitbartNews If the SOFA was so easy then why didn't Bush include a residual force agreement in the original? 		You are so painfully ignorant.
@Corsair9605 @BreitbartNews fun fact: he tried but was unable to correct Bush's fuck up of not negotiating a stay behind force.
@BreitbartNews Fun fact: Bush signed the withdrawal agreement that Obama followed.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Hey LG, you're a sucker.
@AngevinDynasty @BHammer2422 @BreitbartNews what was the unemployment rate 1/20/09? What was the rate 1/20/17? I'll wait.
@AngevinDynasty @BreitbartNews So, no, you can't give any examples because all you're capable of doing is regurgitating shit you've heard but too stupid to actually research? 	Yeah, we already knew that.
@AngevinDynasty @BreitbartNews Got any evidence that backs up your claim about minimum wage and unemployment?
@Cdean0508 @LibertyBritt Maybe he should try "Hiring Americans!"		https://t.co/Sh23HQKKhQ
@Cdean0508 @LibertyBritt Wow. He could shit in your mouth and you'd swear it tasted like chocolate. Sad.		Thanks for admitting that he's done NOTHING on the golf course in terms of deals. Low energy.
@CNNSotu @KateBennett_DC Just imagine the RWNJ outrage if Michelle Obama took 2 separate flights to her vacation home.	And get rid of Kate Bennet, she's useless.
@Cdean0508 @LibertyBritt I see. So you're cool with trump employing illegal immigrants and foreign temp workers instead of Americans? 		America First, amirite? 		Still waiting for you to name a single deal he's negotiated on the golf course. Just one. You can do it!!
@brianschatz World's greatest negotiator helping out Canada and Brazil.
@thehill Senate passed a bipartisan CR and trump reneged when Anne Coulter was mean to him.
@Cdean0508 @LibertyBritt FYI: names ≠ deals
@Cdean0508 @LibertyBritt What are your thoughts on his NJ golf course employing illegal immigrants and his other properties importing foreign temp workers instead of paying Americans a decent wage?
@Cdean0508 @LibertyBritt Yeah, that's what I thought. You make a claim but don't have any proof. Let me help you out and I'll answer my own question; NONE.
@Cdean0508 @LibertyBritt You seem to be avoiding my question; what deal has he gotten done? 	Maybe trump should stay in DC and not golf like he promised.
@Cdean0508 @LibertyBritt trump has golfed more in two years than Obama did in his first 4. Most of Obama's rounds were at DC area courses. trump has flown to FL and NJ 30+ times at a cost of millions/ trip.	Again, what deals has trump gotten done on the course since 1/20/17?
@Cdean0508 @LibertyBritt That's great. So when Obama golfed he wasn't wining and dining but trump does? 	Again, name just one deal that trump got done while golfing since 1/20/17? 	Thanks.
@PreetBharara trump is a bait and switch used car salesman.
@Cdean0508 @LibertyBritt Sure he does. Can you name just one deal he's gotten done while golfing? Just one! Thanks.
@Cdean0508 @AlohaMarLuv @HatchMaria @RealDrGina @JessicaTarlov You're correct but if he's in Florida then more of them are working because they're still protecting the White House too. What kind of idiot would ever complain about the Secret Service working? Go ahead, guess which idiot!!		https://t.co/1s6XlTziTZ
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Except that the Senate already passed a bipartisan bill. 		Ooops!
@renato_mariotti He's trying to find cause to fire Mueller and throwing everything against the proverbial wall.
@realDonaldTrump Party of pro-life, people. Double down on being a complete and total scumbag.
@CBSNews I'd say. First he demanded/ promised that Mexico would pay now US taxpayers are on the hook. He's no better than a bait and switch used car dealer.
@Cdean0508 @HatchMaria @RealDrGina @JessicaTarlov TIL that Obama took weekly flights to his private businesses. Hell, I remember when you RWNJs complained when he took ONE trip to his home in Chicago let alone 30+ to FL and NJ.
@DICEY63 @theotherdfashby @Cdean0508 @HatchMaria @RealDrGina @JessicaTarlov I'd ask you to provide evidence for your claims but you're a MAGAt and only regurgitate what you heard on el Rushbo!
@kiwi_kim88 @NBCNews Maybe read before commenting so you don't look so foolish.
@GrattanJoan @charliekirk11 Michelle's book is Becoming.		Melanie's book will be Be Coming! a word for word copy
@Cdean0508 @HatchMaria @RealDrGina @JessicaTarlov Think it's free to house hundreds of USSS agents and staffers while trump is enjoying yet another round of golf?
@Cdean0508 @HatchMaria @RealDrGina @JessicaTarlov It costs $200k/ hr to fly AF1, it's a 2+h trip one way to Florida so let's see if you can do what a round trip flight costs for just one trip. go.
@HatchMaria @RealDrGina @JessicaTarlov Yeah, and how much does it cost to fly his ass on AF1 to Florida and NJ to play at his course?
@RealDrGina "working"
@thehill Does Sanders know that Pelosi is completely irrelevant at the moment. Minority party in the House holds ZERO power. This is all on trump, there was a deal done in the Senate.
@rodeo3636 @BreitbartNews I'm so old I remember trump complaining that the fed didn't raise rates under Obama. 		For the fiscal morons out there, Obama inherited a recession and that's why rates weren't raised.
@realDonaldTrump Build your wall when Mexico pays up.
@jenwamp @SaraCarterDC @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Do tell. What was the unemployment rate when Obama took office? What was it when he left? Same with the stock market? Let's deal with facts here, if you're capable, which I doubt.
@jenwamp @SaraCarterDC @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Yeah, zero chance that trump would ever come close to curing cancer. Amazing that all the things you RWNJs complained about Obama trump is doing in spades and zero complaints. Wonder why?
@Mldubya77 @SaraCarterDC @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Who said anything about a couple of hours? He's been shamed for months about not visiting the troops.
@SaraCarterDC @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Took him long enough and only after being shamed into it.

@waltshaub Because he'd rather be golfing and grifting in Florida than stuck watching cable news in DC.
@RepMattGaetz E-verify would hurt trump's businesses.
@HixsonButch @BreitbartNews Don't you mean "Damn Mexicans" since trump promised they would pay for the wall?
@RepMattGaetz Your buddy trump imports hundreds of foreign temp workers and hires undocumented immigrants so that he doesn't have to pay Americans a decent wage. Sad!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump If trump needs $5 billion for "boarder" security why hasn't he spent 94% of what was budgeted last year?
@catedempsey @mtracey Again, please find a single (actual) instance of Pelosi calling Mattis "unsuited" or any other criticism (I'll give you that out). 	I'm not splitting hairs; you made a very specific claim and so far have been incapable of backing up your claim. 		So far what you said is fake news
@catedempsey @mtracey 1) You claimed Pelosi said criticized Mattis yet you're unable to provide evidence.		2) Mattis's confirmation hearing was on Jan. 12 and was Sec. of Def of 1/20/17, where's this delay that you speak of? 		Please provide evidence of a single Dem calling Mattis "unsuited". thanks
@JordanUhl Nah, greyhounds are literally the slaves of the canine world.
@ChrisCu10106064 @ChrisCtkwilson @Olivianuzzi Because it's not about him. That's why!
@AirichKeyf @thehill Then why didn't he leave on 1/20/17? Because trump asked him to stay on. Sad!

@Patsloft @mitchellvii How many resigned in protest?

@seanhannity Fox News:  home of the "War on Xmas" is upset about Christmas being politicized.
@MichaelResist73 @seanhannity And been correct 0% of the time.
@jaketapper @MarquardtA @TheLeadCNN Sleep well tonight!!
@DavidAFrench @JonahNRO David, trump would run into an active shooter situation to save the kiddos ..... as long as it's not raining.
@markknoller Bet he's pining to be in Florida! Probably cut off early next week to make up for it.
@SaraCarterDC @jsolomonReports @realDonaldTrump @DevinNunes If there was anything damning in the documents trump would have released it by now. Buckle up!
@RealCandaceO What, no comment about how disrespectful trump is?
@realDonaldTrump Behave yourself today at the funeral and no "thumbs up" pics at the group photo, you bum!
@KimStrassel Who kneeled at Bush's casket?
@JaySekulow Yup, one of your idiotic petitions will stop Iran from testing missiles. 	Don't they have the God given right to bear arms?
@seanhannity Because he's cooperating against INDIVIDUAL #1
@brianschatz Think trump will rage tweet during 41's funeral tomorrow?
@RudyGiuliani You're really ruining your chances at being a cyber expert that you claim to be. Sad!
@atrupar @LindseyGrahamSC So he'd only hold them accountable if they were Dems? What a pussy!
@GOPChairwoman Care to explain how we're going to pay for trump's tax cut for the 1% and his increased spending?
@GOP @realDonaldTrump In the upside down world of the GOP only is it a big win to have the largest trade deficit in US history. Sad!
@realDonaldTrump Why don't you explain it to them since you've literally got nothing on your schedule today, you bum!
@BillPlanebill @JaySekulow Not mentioning "something", you mean the "something" that republicans ran on as the #1 issue during the midterms, that "something" that Jay Sekulow doesn't give a shit about protecting? K!
@RealCandaceO Who is buying your garbage?
@realDonaldTrump Definitely not written by Hair trump.
@BillPlanebill @JaySekulow How'd I know that you'd claim to be a "Christian"? Jesus would be so proud of your indifference. 		Matthew 25:40 for reference.
@Rodscowboylife @JaySekulow TIL that ISIS is a legitimate government. Thanks.
@JaySekulow What exactly does signing your petition do other than put me on your mailing list? 	Why aren't you concerned for the Christians fleeing violence in Central America?
@RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump Sent from your made in China computer.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Thanks to trump bending the knee to Xi.
@PreetBharara Hi Preet, do you know why the DOJ is defending trump's emolumets case and not private lawyers? Why are taxpayers on the hook for his defense?		https://t.co/xf6GAmEZDc
@KimStrassel @AlanDersh @WSJopinion I can see Trump's defense now: FAKE NEWS!!! I only did it cuz Hillary and the Deep State made me collude with Russia!!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Thanks to Trump our trade imbalance with China is at a record high. Sad! Low energy!
@Annakhait Probably because 41 just died, Manafort and Cohen, G20, and Alaska. 		Does that help?
RT @ASlavitt: BREAKING: ACA enrollment down 10% so far with Trump marketing budget down 90%.		The good news: Most can get covered for $75/m…
@GOP @kayleighmcenany LOL. He couldn't even make deals when he had the majority. Best o' luck!
@Ocasio2018 Congress use the ACA marketplace, something that they created. Basic knowledge matters.
@michael_bavaro @RealCandaceO @senatemajldr Got some examples of their cons?
@NBCNews That's a  bullshit excuse.
@WhiteHouse Congrats on not being banned for the third time.
@CNN Melanie will release the same book in 2021: Be Coming!
@MichiganFront @RepMattGaetz @POTUS @CNN @MSNBC @DNC wow. That's quite the defense of trump choosing to hire foreigners over 'Mericans.
@SaraCarterDC @jsolomonReports @seanhannity Hey Sara, when Mueller drops all his evidence do you still plan on defending trump?
@seanhannity @newtgingrich @jsolomonReports @SaraCarterDC @GovMikeHuckabee @HeyTammyBruce @DennisPrager @peterjhasson What's the matter, Sean? Don't  you want to allow liberals on your propaganda show?
@markknoller @SecPompeo @statedeptspox Did Pompeo give them 2 more weeks?
@seanhannity Client #3: EVERYBODY ELSE IS WRONG!!!
@seanhannity Look at Hannity complain about anti corruption bill!
@mstngsally06 @SaraCarterDC If there is something in the FISA warrant why didn't trump already declassify it? Hit me up when you can figure that out, k?
@mstngsally06 @SaraCarterDC That's adorable that you continue to believe the trump lies about what happened during the meeting. First they lied about it happening and then lie about what transpired knowing full well the sheep will continue to believe them.	Sad!
@jamesmadison501 @SaraCarterDC Thanks for admitting there was a meeting and trump lied about it for over a year.
@jamesmadison501 @SaraCarterDC No? Well your reply was an attempt to distract. Did Jr, Manafort, and Kush meet with a KGB lawyer then lie about it for well over a year?
@seanhannity Client #3
@jamesmadison501 @SaraCarterDC What's that have to do with Jr, Manafort, and Kush taking a meeting with the KGB lawyer?
@mstngsally06 @SaraCarterDC Did you fail your GED English test? If you know what the Magnitsky Act is then you know that trump was lying about "adoptions". Why would he lie if it was perfectly legal?
@mstngsally06 @SaraCarterDC He never lied about it? Damn, lay off the Fox News, lady. trump even lied about it when he defended Junior meeting with the KGB lawyers by saying it was about "adoptions". I'd explain the Magnitsky Act but I don't think it'd sink in.
@PeterDawsonUSA @stephenfhayes Then why did trump continue to lie about it? And you have no idea what Mueller knows. Buckle up, buttercup!
@mstngsally06 @SaraCarterDC You're*		And if it's legal then why did they lie about it for over a year and still down play the meeting?
@mstngsally06 @SaraCarterDC Then you're clearly not paying attentions since the purpose of the meeting was to get dirt on Hillary.
@jane_herriot @SaraCarterDC That's some weak ass defense of the trumps meeting with a KGB lawyer to discuss "adoptions" and dirt on Hillary (i.e.: collusion).
@brithume Saving this tweet for when Junior is indicted for lying to Congress.
@SaraCarterDC What are your thoughts on the June 9, 2016 trump tower meeting with the KGB lawyer?
@RepMattGaetz Look at  you defend criminal activity. What a patreet!
@washingtonpost Yes! FCPA!
@MichiganFront @RepMattGaetz @POTUS @CNN @MSNBC @DNC Yeah, I know. Facts scare you guys. You literally had ZERO idea that trump imports hundreds of workers each year to staff his property all while screaming "Hire American!" to the dopes at his rallies. 	You should be ashamed of your ignorance.
@Byronleemarley1 @SaraCarterDC Since you seem to be inside Comey's mind, why doesn't he want to testify behind closed doors? Don't you want to hear what he has to say?	I'd ask for proof of Schiff leaking but you won't provide any concrete examples because you're  a dope.
@SaraCarterDC Literal fake news. Comey is more than willing to testify in public he just doesn't want the corrupt republicans to selectively leak parts of his testimony in private session.
@Joy17123083 @SaraCarterDC He wants to testify in public and not in private so that republicans can selectively leak and twist his words. What do republicans have to hide by not having a public hearing?
@MichiganFront @RepMattGaetz @POTUS so you admit that he's hiring foreigners instead of hiring Americans! Sad and unpatriotic!
@RepMattGaetz @realDonaldTrump You're out of your mind. Cohen just plead guilty to lying about something that happened during the campaign.	Should Mueller give Manafort a pass on tax fraud just because it happened before? Nuts.
@StefanMolyneux Sorry but you have no constitutional right to a twitter account, snowflakes.
@realDonaldTrump Your kids are gonna be indicted soon.
@realDonaldTrump How much did taxpayers spend so you can watch Fox News in Argentina?
@markknoller Trade deficit with China grew to a record in October. What a negotiator!
@MichiganFront @RepMattGaetz @POTUS No reply?
@GOP LOL. Republicans got wiped out in the House and barely picked up 2 seats in the Senate. Don't get me started about what happened at the state level.
@RealCandaceO You won't see that on Fox News. You think that they care about the plight of black Americans?
@realDonaldTrump @dbongino You haven't read past the cover.
@MichiganFront @RepMattGaetz @POTUS Because I don't rely on Fox News to be informed. 		https://t.co/lKWAdm5JBf
@MichiganFront @RepMattGaetz @POTUS "You made the allegation a few tweets ago"	Um, no. I'm stating facts. Trump imports hundreds of foreign workers to staff his properties instead of hiring Americans and paying them a decent wage. Sad!
@MichiganFront @RepMattGaetz @POTUS Is trump hiring foreigners instead of employing Americans?
@guypbenson Hmmm, what was the favor?  A little light money laundering?
@OhNoSheTwitnt I'm shocked that they're actually covering it right now. Hannity is queuing up car chase videos for tonight.
@MichiganFront @RepMattGaetz @POTUS Instead of hiring Americans. So much for "Hire American!", right?!
@realDonaldTrump Still no condolence tweets about our 3 soldiers that died in Afghanistan.
@RepMattGaetz @LouDobbs @FoxBusiness Those Wall St. tycoons and trump thank you for the tax cut for the wealthy.
@RepMattGaetz @POTUS POTUS imports hundreds of foreign workers each and every year instead of hiring Americans and paying them a decent wage. 	Quit your bullshit.
@GOP @cindyhydesmith Great job wasting money on freaking Mississippi!
@RepMattGaetz @Airbnb Being anti-apartheid is not "anti-Semitism"
@SecPompeo That's great that you're allowing Saudis to commit genocide in Yemen then bragging about feeding the dying. Congrats.
@JackieTortora1 @markknoller @cindyhydesmith @espyforsenate Ruskie, your translations software is acting up.
@markknoller Putin won't let him cancel it. All bluster.
@markknoller @POTUS @SteveScalise The bait and switch president* promised that Mexico would pay for the wall.
@ReagansRaptor @DailyCaller Assange promised to hand himself over to US authorities if Pres. Obama granted clemency to Chelsea Manning. Obama commuted her sentence and Assange didn't comply. He's a liar.
@seanhannity I read the Guardian article so I won't be giving your site clicks to see how you tried to twist this in Manafort's and trump's favor.
@ktfomf @seanhannity REEEEEEE!!
@RWMarshall2 @seanhannity Assange said he'd turn himself over to US authorities if Pres. Obama granted clemency to Manning. Assange's word is useless.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump LOL. trump got wiped out in the House and was only able to swing 3 of the 10 vulnerable Dem seats. Sad!
@JackPosobiec @OANN Quite the spin to today's news.
https://t.co/Q7YagFIOvQ
@Talineh99k @TheDonaldNews So you must be pissed about all the campaigning that trump did in October and again yesterday in Mississippi, right?
@TheDonaldNews Wow! trump took off the month of October to campaign all over the country (red states only), thoughts?
@daltonzgang @IngrahamAngle @markknoller @WhiteHouse What are your thoughts on trump not passing a budget and golfing 3x as much as Obama in their first 2 years? I bet you were outraged when Obama traveled to Martha's Vineyard for vacation so what are your thoughts on trump's 20+ visits to Florida?
@IngrahamAngle @markknoller Strange, I didn't see a similar tweet criticizing trump for campaigning for a month straight then heading to Florida for a "working" vacation (at the golf course).
@OldBob47 Man, you must be pissed that trump has outpaced Obama on golf, vacation and campaigning, right? Nah, you're a RW hypocrite.
@ddale8 I'm shocked Repubs didn't pick up 6 seats. 3 is just pathetic.
@RealCandaceO @EkaA02493443 First off, Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador aren't South America. They are fleeing extreme violence that the US has helped to perpetuate in the region. Read up to cure your ignorance.
@RealCandaceO Imagine being so ignorant and lacking in compassion that you have ZERO idea what the people from Guatemala and Honduras are fleeing.
@wharvin @stamos_tpusa @RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump So much for "Hire American. Buy American." amirite? trump drives down wages by importing foreign temp workers and you sheep defend him. Sad!	https://t.co/Sh23HQKKhQ
@stamos_tpusa @RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump Agreed. trump has been taking advantage of everyone for years. That's why he imports hundreds and hundreds of foreign workers to staff his properties instead of hiring Americans and paying them a decent wage. 	Suckers!
@RealCandaceO Hey CO, what have republicans done for blacks in the Southern states?
@benshapiro Why does it matter if they carried a flag of their home country? Guess you owned the libs with that one.
@thehill Graham is a first class grifter.
@CGrhound @realDonaldTrump @EntheosShines Why hasn't trump called for the release of Dr. Walid Fitaihi who has been held by MBS for more than a year? Do you care and remember him?
@PoliticalMind16 @DailyCaller The entire country of Honduras; highest murder rate in the western hemisphere.
@DailyCaller DC hates Christian Latinos. Too bad they're not from the Middle East so that you hypocrites could pretend to carry about their safety.
Weekly update (Nov. 25):		It's been awhile but trump finally made it back to the course this week (5 days in a row to include Thanksgiving)		Sources:	https://t.co/7lCJQcJhpm	https://t.co/6V9Igtkj8S https://t.co/vQ5sNJyYzS
@kylegriffin1 5 days in a row. 		Damn, what a hard worker.
@TIME Mueller.
@RepMattGaetz So much for Due Process. Maybe you'll get yours though.
@redsteeze Let me know when AOC calls Fox News and others "the enemy of the American people". Nice false equivalence you got there.
@kylegriffin1 4th day in a row golfing. Clearly too busy to visit troops or sit for Mueller.
@SaraCarterDC Anyone else remember when trump complained that interest rates were too low? The internet does. 		https://t.co/medpgNi5dC
@Youre2Deluded @rwilzb001 @NBCNews High on interpretation. reads article. quotes comey. gets called a partisan by a simpleton. 		Watch Comey's senate hearing for clues.
@Youre2Deluded @rwilzb001 @NBCNews Hey simpleton, he wants a public hearing so that republicans can't selectively leak and distort his testimony like they did to Andrew McCabe. My 12 year old has a better grasp of politics than you do. Of course he can answer classified question in private later.
@Youre2Deluded @rwilzb001 @NBCNews Thanks for proving my point that this is political posturing by Republicans and you're incapable of understanding it. 	Again, he can answer question in public and anything that's asked that's classified can be answered privately. 	Not too difficult to comprehend, unless you can't
@Youre2Deluded @rwilzb001 @NBCNews Ummm, sorry, but they can ask him these questions in public and any answers he can't give can be asked again in private. Maybe watch the Comey Senate hearing as a reference, k?
@Youre2Deluded @rwilzb001 @NBCNews Wrong. He wants it out in the open so that republicans can't selectively leak out of context statements.
@seanhannity Let me guess, tonight's guests include Sara Carter, John Solomon, Greg Jarret, Dan Bognino, etc... 		What a fucking joke post
@RealCandaceO They won't ban trump so you'll be holding your breath.
@thehill Did he dedicate today's and tomorrow's rounds of golf to our service men and women?
@SteveSGoddard @sandyblueocean @realDonaldTrump Complains that liberals don't use critical thinking skills but doesn't check his graph. Your graph is mislabeled; in your link it says "total acreage burned (all lands)" then you post a mislabeled "forest fire burn acreage. 	Typical dishonest con.

@KTwitty @washingtonpost She didn't use a private email to conduct gubmint business?
@GOP trump went on US tv and defended Saudi dictators that brutally murdered a US resident.
@GOPChairwoman @cindyhydesmith @realDonaldTrump Mississippi does love its bigots!
@GOP Saudi Arabia funneled millions into trump's bank account and he defended their murdering of a US resident.
@GOP What about having a president who's in this to enrich himself at the expense of taxpayers (trump vacationing for an entire week at Mar a Lago).
@WHPublicPool GOLF!!!

@jaketapper Stop having her on your show. All she does is lie, deflect, and propagandize.
@QuailJeff @townhallcom Not too much different than trump. Only 26% of his candidates won. Sad!
@RealCandaceO Yeah, maybe if you idiot RWs stopped treating Latinxs like animals they'd vote republican but you bigots just can't help yourselves.
@LarryWitkovski @EdDarrell @HuntinHippy @KimStrassel Can you do "clean coal" next? 		Please tell us what trump "means" when he talks about "scrubbing the coal".
@librab103 @ABC @FiveThirtyEight Do poor people not deserve representation and Congresswomen that will fight for them?

@seanhannity @HeyTammyBruce When you plan on talking about Ivanka using private email and trump bashing American heroes?
@kylegriffin1 I bet he wears his brown pants.
@kylegriffin1 But not before he spends a week at Sea to Lake and then a rally in Mississippi on Monday.
@seanhannity Hey Hannity, you plan on talking about Ivanka tonight? Or trump's disrespect of our military?
@ddale8 Another chocked full day.
@realDonaldTrump @cindyhydesmith So a week off of golfing then straight to a campaign rally. You really are a lazy POS.
@markknoller @PressSec You guys need to stop attending the rare press briefings and stop asking trump questions; all they do is lie lie lie
@jasonukfan @iburketh @KimStrassel That's amazing. So you're saying that Sessions recused himself so he wouldn't have to fight with Mueller?		(FYI: Sessions recused himself 2 months before Mueller was appointed).	You people are fucking stupid.
@WilbertMatt35 @NicaGolpista @_LeahKay_ @DailyCaller No. Us pour Xtians are prosecuted all thyme. We haves all the power but people keep sayin Happy Holidaze to us and it makes me so mad. Starbukcx won't even put Baby Jesus on a cup. How can I enjoy my latte without a pic of baby jesus?

@DaMichaelangelo @seanhannity Except the constitution trumps any and all laws and acting AG requires senate confirmation.

@maggieNYT trump doesn't want to upset his sugar daddy.
@JonahNRO I'm waiting for trump to take credit for Bin Laden's death.
@LarryWitkovski @EdDarrell @HuntinHippy @KimStrassel trump can overrule them and he hasn't. That should tell you something.
@LarryWitkovski @EdDarrell @HuntinHippy @KimStrassel Well, as long as you FEEL that way it must be true. Care to explain why Page was under surveillance way back in 2013-4?
@LarryWitkovski @EdDarrell @HuntinHippy @KimStrassel Of course they would but in this discussion I'm not quoting unsubstantiated quotes attributed to McCabe, that would be your doing.
@LarryWitkovski @EdDarrell @HuntinHippy @KimStrassel Except that House Dems don't have the power to stop House GOP and the President from releasing the unredacted documents so maybe you should ask why they haven't done it yet?
@LarryWitkovski @EdDarrell @HuntinHippy @KimStrassel You mean the redacted portion that's about 75% of the document?
@GOP @realDonaldTrump trump won the senate? not how that works.
@LarryWitkovski @EdDarrell @HuntinHippy @KimStrassel Dems won't do that because they don't have the power but that's just an inconvenient fact.
@LarryWitkovski @EdDarrell @HuntinHippy @KimStrassel You are correct that neither one of us have seen the testimony. However, only one of us is claiming that McCabe said something that hasn't been proven. 	Clearly? Because the GOP would NEVER spin something to make trump  look good, right?
@LarryWitkovski @EdDarrell @HuntinHippy @KimStrassel Good thing that they didn't principally use the Dossier to get the FISA warrant. And 90% of the mentions of Page in the dossier were related to verifiable activities (speeches) that he conducted in Moscow.
@LarryWitkovski @EdDarrell @HuntinHippy @KimStrassel You're the one making the claim, burden of proof is on you to back up your assertions then I'll rebut.
@LarryWitkovski @EdDarrell @HuntinHippy @KimStrassel Don't know until the GOP release his testimony. Why you think it is that they haven't done that?
@LarryWitkovski @EdDarrell @HuntinHippy @KimStrassel https://t.co/78gsyJCEss
@LarryWitkovski @EdDarrell @HuntinHippy @KimStrassel Link the verbatim quote. As stated, it's the GOP's "interpretation" of what McCabe said behind closed doors of which the GOP has refused to redact and release his testimony.
@LarryWitkovski @EdDarrell @HuntinHippy @KimStrassel He was fired? they ended their collaboration and that in no way is evidence that he is an uncredible source. That's fallacious reasoning.
@LarryWitkovski @EdDarrell @HuntinHippy @KimStrassel going to the press didn't affect his credibility, it was a breach but had no effect on his investigatory abilities.
@LarryWitkovski @EdDarrell @HuntinHippy @KimStrassel Please link McCabe's verbatim quote and not a GOP Rep.'s interpretation of what McCabe said behind closed doors. thanks.
@LarryWitkovski @EdDarrell @HuntinHippy @KimStrassel You want to admit that he had nothing to do with trump's campaign or were trump, Conway, and Page lying? And if they were lying what are they trying to cover up?
@LarryWitkovski @EdDarrell @HuntinHippy @KimStrassel Who said anything about his status? I thanked you for admitting that the FISA warrant was on Page and not the campaign. 	And we really have minimal idea what's in the FISA warrant since the vast majority is redacted.
@LarryWitkovski @EdDarrell @HuntinHippy @KimStrassel "It had nothing to do with the allegations made against Carter Page in the FISA warrant."		Ok, clarify this statement. FYI: the FISA warrant was on Page and not trump.
@LarryWitkovski @EdDarrell @HuntinHippy @KimStrassel Maybe look at the comment that I replied to or don't you pay attention to what you write?
@LarryWitkovski @EdDarrell @HuntinHippy @KimStrassel Thank you for admitting that the FISA warrant was for Page and not the trump campaign and as we all know, Page wasn't part of the turmp campaign UNLESS you think that trump, Conway, and Page are liars? Then what are they hiding?
@JonLemire Not very well.
@DeplorableRev @EdDarrell @HuntinHippy @KimStrassel "But regardless of recommendation, I was going to fire Comey knowing  there was no good time to do it And in fact, when I decided to just do  it, I said to myself — I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump  and Russia is a made-up story."

@GOP @realDonaldTrump Can your next tweet be about all vets being screwed over because trump's VA can't get their shit together and send out their GI Bill benefits?
@JonLemire If only they had raked up all the forests first!!!
@LeeFerguson111 @mindrelated @CTinHB @RealCandaceO The IRS "makes" its own rules based on pre-existing laws. Let me guess, you were against Obama's use of EOs but are fine with trump doing things that require congressional authorization. 	And yeah, he does need legislation, dope!
@mindrelated @CTinHB @RealCandaceO Not only that but it wasn't even a bill. There has been no legislation passed for him to sign. 	Candace is either too dumb to know this or she's purposely lying to her idiot followers.
@Charles28973069 @RealCandaceO What truth? What legislation did trump sign? (make sure you research before you comment)
@RealCandaceO Hey Dopey Candace, trump didn't sign legislation. Damn, you're dumb. He signed a promise to promise to do something.
@bellwhiff @ChrisCuomo Answer is that he keeps trump's hotels afloat.

@EdDarrell @LarryWitkovski @HuntinHippy @KimStrassel I say this knowing full well that they're all prolific liars and Page was part of the campaign but the FBI never targeted trump, they targeted Page as he was on their radar since at least 2013.
@EdDarrell @LarryWitkovski @HuntinHippy @KimStrassel trump claims he's never met or spoken with him. 	conway gave an interview after she took over as campaign manager and said that Page was never part of the campaign while she was in charge.	Page has said that he's never spoken with trump.
@LarryWitkovski @EdDarrell @HuntinHippy @KimStrassel Care to explain how Page is a "political opponent" since, to the best of my knowledge, he has never run for office? Thanks.
@LarryWitkovski @EdDarrell @HuntinHippy @KimStrassel If Page never spoke with trump and wasn't part of the campaign then feel free to explain how the FISA warrant had anything to do with the trump campaign. I'm all ears and open to a plausible explanation.
@LarryWitkovski @EdDarrell @HuntinHippy @KimStrassel @GeorgePapa19 Do you plan on addressing my comment about Page and the FISA warrant or are those inconvenient facts?
@HuntinHippy @EdDarrell @LarryWitkovski @KimStrassel WE ARE ALL Q!!!!
@LarryWitkovski @EdDarrell @HuntinHippy @KimStrassel FISA warrant was for Page not the trump campaign.	trump claimed he never met/ talked to Page.	Page claims he never spoke with trump.	Conway stated that Page was not part of the campaign after she took over.	Page officially quit trump campaign before FISA warrant was issued.
@realDonaldTrump Your pledge to hire Americans? How many foreigners have you imported to staff Sea to Lake and your winery?
@LarryWitkovski @EdDarrell @HuntinHippy @KimStrassel So not the primary source. Thanks for the confirmation.
@realDonaldTrump And when do you plan on going to California to show your support?
@LarryWitkovski @EdDarrell @HuntinHippy @KimStrassel Yeah, except Schiff's letter makes no such claim. Of course you could back it up by linking the specific passage from his letter if you want to be believed ... or not.
@marcorubio No, you're being roasted because it's a moronic analogy.
@jfreewright @marcorubio What's worse is that he DID play football and he still came up with that moronic metaphor.
@ChrisCuomo Did Chris ask her who in the hell designed and who approved the ballots? Get your shit together Broward Cty!
@WHPublicPool Let me guess, lots of executive time and not much of anything else except a run to McD's?
@TomiLahren Hey Tammy, that was Congress that changed the school lunches. I know facts don't matter to conservative bobble heads but try and learn.
@TomiLahren Who said she's upset? She couldn't care less.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Wait! I thought it was because he "assaulted" a woman? Now it's because he wouldn't give up the mic? 	Please pick an excuse and stick with it.
@RonKemmerer @KimStrassel You really are proud of your stupidity, aren't you? 	Do tell, when was Podesta AG? 	Being a lobbyist doesn't mean you can't work for the gubmint; just check out trump's WH, it's chock full of lobbyists. 	Fucking dope!
@jivey81 @Kat_makumane @DOUBOISTACKS900 @CharlieBooker7 @nowthisnews Man, you guys come up with the most pathetic excuses.
@nowthisnews Wait! Was that Obama getting off Marine One in the rain? I thought they didn't fly in the rain?
@Colorado_Right @AriFleischer Well, if they end up back in jail then they lose their right to vote but we shouldn't punish those that have integrated into our society.
@MarkLarsen64 @AriFleischer Why not brand an X on their foreheads so that they'll be ostracized for life?
@bennyjohnson is that why our low energy POtuS couldn't be bothered to go to a rainy ceremony or walk with other world leaders?
@KaraRBrown @Dave_Stein @heyaries1981 @junyabunya Literally nothing in that article says it's a "Nazi Facebook Group".		I'm sure you hate it when Repubs are dishonest and lie so how about holding yourself to a higher standard?
@RonKemmerer @KimStrassel Hey short bus denizen, read the statute I linked. Has ZERO to do with financial interests.		Damn, you cons are so fucking dumb.
@GOPChairwoman Nice spin on your spin that the election was a win for Republicans. Damn, your supporters are dumb.
@realDonaldTrump No work to do today? Can't visit Arlington? Nope, got to spend your day watching Fox. 		FYI: Gasparino thinks you're an idiot too.
@nytpolitics @jimrutenberg How about just ignoring him? That'll really piss him off.
@seanhannity Hey Sean, when you planning on criticizing trump for missing a ceremony because of rain? Pathetic!
@realDonaldTrump Do you plan on visiting the areas....ever?
@RonKemmerer @KimStrassel For the short bus riders, Sessions was part of the campaign, he was a foreign policy advisor and that's why he recused himself. 		Damn, you Cons keep proving what we've been saying for years; YOU'RE FUCKING STUPID!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump @GOP You must still be drunk.
@EWErickson TIL that voter suppression isn't stealing the election. Thanks, EE!
@jdawsey1 For the last 3 weeks he's done jack shit except hold rallies. Laziest POS to ever occupy the WH.

@brianstelter Fox News not being factual? I'm shocked! Shocked!
@nick_p_carroll @Sebastianchobbs @ThaleckyThomas @mrsdianek @FOX10Phoenix @ddale8 that's a great idea but we don't have that system at the moment so use your brain and vote for the candidate that most closely aligns with your ideology that has a chance of winning.

@seanhannity Hey Sean, thoughts on trump skipping the ceremony to honor American heroes because of the rain? You'd be all over Obama for that even though Obama toughed it out in a downpour on Memorial Day.
@ShelaSmith3 @adamklaughtalk I bet you voted for the pedophile in Alabama's special election and voted for the guy that bragged about grabbing women by the pussy, didn't you?
@GOPChairwoman @ScottforFlorida Hey Ronna Romney, it's an automatic recount. Learn the law.
@jdolan0133 @seanhannity Not when he's golfing		https://t.co/IKMHUh5KDN
@Triciae44 @KimStrassel I don't expect Cons to research before commenting (proud of their ignorance). He recused because he was a foreign policy advisor to the campaign and DOJ regs require recusal so there's no conflict of interest.
@RonKemmerer @KimStrassel Wrong. His recusal was because the FBI was investigating Russian interference in the election and possible coordination with the trump campaign of which Sessions was a foreign policy advisor. Per DOJ regs, his recusal was required because of his involvement with campaign, sonny
@foxandfriends @SecWilkie Has Fox tweeted that trump cancelled his trip to the American cemetery because it's raining? trump putting his hair before honoring those that sacrificed everything. Pathetic!
@frodo3245 @greta @PastorDScott @larryelder @charliekirk11 So Whitaker didn't take Sessions' job?
@blakehounshell His hair is more important than honoring heroes.
@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump What about helping Christians fleeing violence in Central America?
@jasonukfan @KimStrassel Yeah, except the DOJ regulations aren't laws, bumpkin. 		Dershowitz also thinks that someone can't commit OOJ out in public that it has to be done in private.
@realDonaldTrump Great job doubling down on your " I don't know him" lie.	If you don't know him, why did you appoint him?
@jasonukfan @KimStrassel I guess some Kentucky bumpkin knows better than the DOJ and Sessions. My bad.
@jasonukfan @KimStrassel For the dopes in the room allow me to explain, it doesn't matter if trump had 1 million advisors, Sessions was one of them and per DOJ regulations had to recuse himself from the investigation.
@mkos66 @jpodhoretz She sounds a lot like trump.
@jasonukfan @KimStrassel Yup, each guy at the table represents 10k "other people". 	Damn, you guys really are dumb. No wonder trump can con you so easily. https://t.co/OPRUR4W84t

@SteveKornacki Steve, who is responsible for the ballot design; county or state?
@AmandaHuggin1 @AndrewCFollett @seanmdav Except I didn't ask you about the runoff, I asked you about them still counting ballots in Georgia. Not too smart, are you?
@AmandaHuggin1 @AndrewCFollett @seanmdav You'd think that someone that claims to be knowledgeable of Florida law would be able to point out the specific statute. Guess you were talking out your ass.
@hissavinggrace1 @VinceGottalotta @NancyCrandall3 @kilgore9669 @KimStrassel Read up.		https://t.co/YkLpSHGOjh
@hissavinggrace1 @VinceGottalotta @NancyCrandall3 @kilgore9669 @KimStrassel Yeah, read that statute. It's required that the person be in a position that was confirmed by the Senate first. Whitaker has never been confirmed.
@AmandaHuggin1 @AndrewCFollett @seanmdav "If final tally is less than 50%, there’s an auto recount."		You really are ignorant. If final tally is less than 50% then there is runoff election. 		Learn 1st, tweet 2d!		https://t.co/baf6MkbVOM
@AmandaHuggin1 @AndrewCFollett @seanmdav Yeah, except Georgia hasn't started the recount yet because they're still tallying from Tuesday.  	3 days since election and AZ is still counting ballots with hundreds of thousands yet to go.		Learn 1st, tweet 2nd.		Now, which code on your list was violated? Thanks.
@TomiLahren And your president ran off to France instead of comforting victims of the shooting and fires (never visited areas affected last year either)
@arttavana @adventuregirl @TomiLahren Because they don't fucking work. 		How about action instead of useless prayers?
@AmandaHuggin1 @AndrewCFollett @seanmdav I see, you make a claim but can't provide the specific statute. I'd act surprised but Cons never provide facts.
@AmandaHuggin1 @AndrewCFollett @seanmdav You must be outraged that they're still counting ballots in Arizona? And Georgia? (both states run by Repubs)
@AmandaHuggin1 @AndrewCFollett @seanmdav Decision doesn't make the ballots "fraudulent or illegal" 		You're welcome.
@AmandaHuggin1 @AndrewCFollett @seanmdav which specific code? Let's see if you can narrow it down.
@AmandaHuggin1 @AndrewCFollett @seanmdav I'm assuming you're find the relevant statutes?
@VinceGottalotta @NancyCrandall3 @kilgore9669 @KimStrassel feel free to point out which specific clause exempts Whitaker from holding the position that requires him to have been confirmed by the senate.
@AmandaHuggin1 @AndrewCFollett @seanmdav OK, attorney, which laws were broken? Please cite the code so us twitter lawyers can learn (I bet you don't cite a single law).	How many mail in and absentee ballots did Orange county have?
@AynRiedel98 @GOPChairwoman Care to explain how contacting voters that forgot to sign ballots (allowed by Florida law) is fraud?
@VinceGottalotta Let me know when you provide the evidence that the initial FBI investigation was solely counter intel because you're so fucking retarded that you think that Sessions recused himself from a criminal investigation that began 2 months later.	Learn how to read a timeline, retard.
@AmandaHuggin1 @AndrewCFollett @seanmdav Dumbass, that doesn't mean that the ballots are fraudulent. 		Let me guess, if you cast one of those ballots and it wasn't counted you'd be cool with that? Of course you wouldn't, moron.
@VinceGottalotta Adios retard!
@VinceGottalotta Says the retard that is using the talking point that it was always a counter intel investigation but is incapable of providing a shred of evidence to back up his claim. 		One last chance and then I'm out:	where's your evidence it was initially just a counter intel investigation?
@VinceGottalotta I'm going to assume I'm dealing with a retard who is incapable of following a timeline so let's do this step by step;		provide evidence that the INITIAL FBI investigation was solely a counter intel investigation.
@AmandaHuggin1 @AndrewCFollett @seanmdav If he hasn't seen the ballots why is he calling them fraudulent and illegal? Jesus fucking brick wall who can't understand 2nd grade logic.
@VinceGottalotta Again, this authorization came after Sessions had recused himself. Where is your evidence that the previous FBI investigation was solely counter intel? I'll wait.
@AmandaHuggin1 @AndrewCFollett @seanmdav No, I'm asking for AF to provide evidence that the ballots are fraudulent and illegal which he's incapable of doing.
@VinceGottalotta Next time you make a claim, you should provide the proof with your assertion or have you never heard of "burden of proof" and whose responsibility it is to provide evidence to back up claims. 		Good luck searching, you won't find shit to back up your ignorant claim.
@VinceGottalotta Care to retract or move the goalposts?		"(c) 	If the Special Counsel believes it is necessary and appropriate, the Special Counsel is authorized to PROSECUTE FEDERAL CRIMES arising from the investigation of these matters."		 https://t.co/Cy3ddrmp1j
@VinceGottalotta Do I need to educate you that Rosenstein's letter came months after Sessions recused himself?  But go ahead and point out where in RR's letter it states that it's solely a "counter intelligence investigation" 		I'll wait.
@VinceGottalotta @jack I'M BEING SHADOW BANNED!!! I'M A VICTIM!!1  		I guess I must be a conservative is I'm shadow banned, right?
@VinceGottalotta Let's see you provide a smidgen of proof that the FBI investigation wasn't a criminal investigation.  (Hint: dozens of indictments are evidence that it's a criminal investigation and always has been.)
@AmandaHuggin1 @AndrewCFollett @seanmdav So because there was a court case last year these ballots are fraudulent and illegal? I'm not following your "logic"? What evidence do you have that THESE ballots are fraudulent and illegal.
@markknoller Maybe he'll stop by Afghanistan on the way home? 	Nah... he's a coward.
@VinceGottalotta You were saying? 		https://t.co/eaP8Uamn55
@bambiwhite1758 @KimStrassel Can you say that again but this time in English? Thanks.
@AndrewCFollett @seanmdav I'd ask for proof that the ballots are "fraudulent and illegal" but you won't provide any.
@realDonaldTrump You're going to look like an ass in France.
@richardsnyders1 @KimStrassel https://t.co/zCsVavcXNY
@VinceGottalotta Cite the statute you are sourcing. Bet you can't and won't.
@HuntinHippy @EdDarrell @KimStrassel If you said so then I guess it didn't happen. You have access to FISA courts?
@jasonukfan @KimStrassel Damn, you people are stupid. Sessions was a foreign policy consultant for the trump campaign. Which means he was a surrogate.
@janconcern @KimStrassel Where'd you go? Still looking for the Sessions quote?
@framerfor45 Go ahead and link the statute you claim was inappropriately cited or was it something that El Rushbo and Hannity told you and you didn't bother to research on your own?
@NancyCrandall3 @kilgore9669 @KimStrassel Yeah, George Conway (R) is a Democrat, right? You understand that Whitaker needs to be senate confirmed to be in that position, right?  Maybe you don't since you get your news from Fox.
@janconcern @KimStrassel Go ahead and link the quote (I bet you don't/ can't).
@DmanfeldDeezy @KimStrassel Not paying attention. Mueller turned a profit with his investigation.
@janconcern @KimStrassel Got a source for your claim that Rosenstein recommended he do it? Thanks.
@mpdugas @KimStrassel I can't tell if you're trolling or fucking stupid.
@slolivari @KimStrassel Which incorrect statute did he cite? Thanks.
@markknoller @Acosta @PressSec @POTUS Why didn't someone ask him why he defended Corey Lewandowski who actually assaulted Michelle Fields?
@roniball1 @KimStrassel For the dopes in the audience, Dems had nothing to do with his recusal. Speaking of soulless liars, you're a MAGAt.
@blakehounshell TIL that the special counsel needs to be senate confirmed unlike the AG.
@WingSuitZero @SherrySwain @SayrahDatIs @JenniferJJacobs @brianstelter You're arguing with a "Christian" that supports trump; she's not capable of critical thinking.
@JenniferJJacobs He forgot her like he forgets to sign his EOs
@PolarWhut Did I say it wasn't, fuckstick?
@NateSilver538 How is MN a swing state?
@PolarWhut OMG you people are so fucking dumb. She didn't want trump obstructing the investigation. How do you find your way home at night, dumbass?
@PolarWhut @KimStrassel I know context doesn't matter to you dopes but the first tweet was sent 2 months before Mueller was appointed so the situation changed.
@KimStrassel Dems engineered his recusal? Silly me, I thought he recused himself per DOJ regulations because he was a campaign surrogate.
@ToddMitchem @emibee17 Then why did it happen in Sutherland Texas?
@RudyGiuliani Let me get this straight; we shouldn't count the votes of the last county because they're last to report? Can we apply this across the country.	nice derp logic.
@GOPChairwoman @ScottforFlorida SHAME ON DEMOCRATS FOR COUNTING EVERY BALLOT!!!
@honoraryamerica @GOPChairwoman What laws did she break? States run the elections, not the federal government.
@GOPChairwoman Ronna is a fascist that thinks that all ballots shouldn't be counted.
@LindseyGrahamSC @ScottforFlorida "apparent"		Lindsey is against counting all votes. Typical fascist republican.
@joncoopertweets No bail because he's a flight risk. Seize his passports.
@jgyanks96 @parscale Yeah, except states are in charge of elections not the federal government. Please learn your constitution.
@parscale TIL that Maricopa county is Democrat. Psst...they voted for your boss but not by the margin they voted for Romney
@TuckerCarlson I'm too lazy to search your tweets to see how you fully support Colin Kaepernick so I'll assume it's true.
@SteveKornacki So is this another shitty ballot design? Do they not test them beforehand?
@rob_westervelt @Cassandra16123 @KFILE Tammy Duckworth.
@TomiLahren Don't worry, Tammy, your guns are safe tonight. Glad to see you're so emPathetic.
@NotPutinsPuppet @jimsciutto 350k		https://t.co/l8KeuzANBU
@GOPChairwoman So she destroyed ballots that were in favor of Nelson? Interesting theory you got there.
@marcorubio Why you nervous? You should want every vote counted.
@marcorubio Where's your post complaining about GOP lawyers wanting to suppress mail in ballots in Arizona?
@MattZupon @GOPChairwoman You mean like locking voting machines in a closet? Or sending machines sans power cords to polling locations? Or voter suppression such as purging voter rolls? Or denying felons the right to vote?
@seanhannity trump putting Whitaker as acting AG is an abuse of power, he's never been confirmed by the Senate.
RT @FlaDems: ⚠️ If you voted with a provisional ballot, you need to make sure your vote is counted. Contact your Supervisor of Elections of…
@katieivie @Txkidatheart @seanhannity How was he not doing his job?		And it does matter because of line of succession. If he was fired then Rosenstein becomes acting AG. Maybe if you watched news other than Fox you'd know this.
@katieivie @seanhannity "willingly"		First of all, trump only wants Sessions out because of the Russian investigation. Just additional evidence of obstruction of justice.
@PerPede11349039 @FoxNews Yes, the pattern is white conservative males.
@excitingdenise @FoxNews Too busy being offended by a CNN reporter.
@FoxNews Prob another RW incel trump lover.
@rebeccaballhaus strange because trump defended Lewandowski when he assaulted Michelle Fields.		https://t.co/u9BiEWDVPJ
@PressSec What about a campaign manager putting his hands on a reporter?		https://t.co/u9BiEWDVPJ
@KathyScott20 @seanhannity Is trump a King or something?
@atrupar A tweet for every single occasion:		https://t.co/u9BiEWDVPJ
@amber_athey @nyfanin2ndcity So you're saying that she tried to rip it away from him.
@amber_athey Ripped? LOL, what video did you watch?
@mschlapp I agree. Shame on them for wanting to hold trump accountable.
@foxandfriends @DanCrenshawTX Anyone else remember when Conservatives called us snowflakes and to suck it up and stop being so PC?
@mschlapp Quite the take.
@ddale8 Now that the scary black man is out of the White House huskers want medicaid expansion. Can't make this shit up.
@greg_doucette Now do the 2014 midterm instead of comparing to Pres. election year.
@Duck_person @jpodhoretz Nah, he's not giving up his seat for a 2 year stint at AG.
@ComfortablySmug So NOT every single? And Tester?
@IngrahamAngle Voting is absurd? Are you a Nazi or something?
@PattyBatton @_Michelangelo__ @seanhannity GOP already had the senate and they can't do much without the House. Investigations are coming!
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse All this POS does is watch TV, tweet, and waste taxpayer money flying to campaigns and his properties.
@IngrahamAngle "I'm a proud racist, bigoted Nazi and that's why I'm voting Republican!"
@briantylercohen Did he ask any of the hotties to meet him backstage?
@mschlapp Good. Republicans need to suffer some voter suppression. Maybe then you'll have empathy for what your party is doing to minorities and the poor.
@atrupar Right wingers are snowflakes.
@AdventureUs15 @Joannem777 @SaraCarterDC @nbcsnl Of course you aren't outraged when trump insults our war heroes or their families, that's because you're a #Hypocrite.
@AdventureUs15 @Joannem777 @SaraCarterDC @nbcsnl Thanks for admitting you're a hypocrite. Nice faux outrage you got there. Let me guess, it didn't bother you that trump attacked a Gold Star mother either.
@SaraCarterDC Bunch of RW snowflakes acting all PC. Sad!
@RealCandaceO @taylorswift13 @Oprah Hey Candace, you lost Kanye. Feel stupid? So now you attack other celebrities while you tell your sheep who to vote for.
@Joannem777 @SaraCarterDC @nbcsnl What are your thoughts on trump mocking McCain's service?
@bennyjohnson I'm going to wager that you don't have a single tweet calling out trump's mocking of McCain.		Your outrage rings hollow, snowflake.
@clongell @RodgerRodge @WhigsnTwigs @PaulRieckhoff I just checked your timeline and couldn't find any condemnation of trump for his treatment of McCain. 		Your complaint rings hollow.
@CntrOfEvrythng @HughJor67496599 @FoxNews @POTUS @Andrews_JBA Attending a rally during the day? Get a job, u bum!
@HughJor67496599 @FoxNews @POTUS @Andrews_JBA I think you mean that this "man" never works.
@FoxNews @POTUS @Andrews_JBA Who is paying for all these trips?
@GlennThrush No wonder the Times pulled you from the WH. Your objectivity is for shit.
@SaraCarterDC Stop being such a snowflake. 	He was ragging on multiple politicians' looks. 	Want to be upset? Be pissed that trump has yet to publicly acknowledge the death of Major Taylor in Afghanistan.
@SaraCarterDC Why are Cons such snowflakes? 		Nice projection.
@TomiLahren Suck it up, Snowflake.
@JohnCornyn Snowflake!!
@stephenfhayes Buck up, cupcake.
@thehill Pretty sure that Starr isn't involved in the investigation and knows just as much as the rest of us.
@RealSaavedra Snowflakes.
@Rev_BlueMoon @andyndelaney @gabrielmalor She has been referred but there is ZERO evidence that she submitted a false claim other than Grassley's "suspicion".
@FoxNews Has trump even mentioned his sacrifice or is he too busy bragging about his electoral college win?
@andyndelaney @gabrielmalor What does Swetnick have to do with the accusation that Grassley submitted to the FBI?
@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump Hey Ingraham, what about Christians in Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador escaping extreme violence, do they not matter?
@RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump @BLEXIT You're appalled so you want people to give you money? Yeah, you're a grifter. Plain and simple.
@RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump @BLEXIT Buck up, snowflake. Perfectly legal.
@BTabooli @CSLowrie1 @brithume My "assumption" is that she named people at the party before Kavanaugh released his calendar which confirmed those people were planning on attending. That's more than a coincidence, don't you think?
@BTabooli @CSLowrie1 @brithume See previous comment; not her BF. 	Calendar entry written before date, yes or no?
@BTabooli @CSLowrie1 @brithume Yeah, not her boyfriend. https://t.co/WJvPIyeZlM
@BTabooli @CSLowrie1 @brithume "7 boys listed at party"	Again, since you weren't paying attention, that calendar entry was written before the party happened. Why are you having comprehension issues?
@BTabooli @CSLowrie1 @brithume Last time; party was traumatic for Ford, normal party for Keyser. If reading that 3x doesn't sink in then there's nothing I can do for you.
@BTabooli @CSLowrie1 @brithume Then why did Mitchell begin to question Kavanaugh only to be cut loose after she zeroed in on his calendar entry? 		July 1 calendar entry (released after Ford had named attendees) included many people she mentioned.
@RepMattGaetz @HouseGOP @POTUS You forgot to mention the out of control deficit but I'm sure that was an honest mistake on your part, right?
@BTabooli @CSLowrie1 @brithume I already told you how I squared it; the event was traumatic for Blasey Ford so she remember it, to Keyser it was just another party.		Thoughts on Kavanaugh's "I didn't party during the week" contradiction?
@seanhannity @dbongino How did he ever get access to trump's covfefe boy?
@BTabooli @CSLowrie1 @brithume Shameful that you give more weight to his account than two women who also submitted sworn testimony.
@BTabooli @CSLowrie1 @brithume We don't know because they weren't brought in to be questioned but it's clear from the entry that it was written pre-party, agreed?
@BTabooli @CSLowrie1 @brithume You should care since she was brought in to question Ford and BK but was stopped from questioning Kavanaugh after she zeroed in on his July 1 entry which was a contradiction. He claimed he didn't party during the week, July 1, 1982 was a Thursday night.
@BTabooli @CSLowrie1 @brithume I see. So you only believe the sworn testimony of an anonymous ex-boyfriend over numerous women. Thank you for the clarification.
@BTabooli @CSLowrie1 @brithume Just because they were on the calendar does that mean that they were all there for the entirety? 	FYI: if you look at the calendar it was written before the party took place; "go to Timmy's..." not "went to Timmy's..."		https://t.co/EzWtFR0MOJ
@BTabooli @CSLowrie1 @brithume OMG, she changed "short" to "narrow". That's it, we got her! 	Rachel Mitchell's, hired by republicans, not allowed to question Kavanaugh, wrote a memo stating Kavanaugh wouldn't be prosecuted. Nobody was asking for him to be prosecuted.
@Fahrenthold @realDonaldTrump Have the NY, NJ, and CT AGs filed suit too? Seems like his NYC properties have the same conflict of interest.
@BTabooli @CSLowrie1 @brithume How about the contradiction that she mentioned people that were there that just so happened to be on Kavanaugh's calendar? I'm sorry, that wasn't a contradiction, that was a coincidence. 	I don't seem to recall her changing the layout of the house design, got a link?
@BTabooli @CSLowrie1 @brithume So you give weight to sworn testimony? Does that include the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford and Julie Swetnick?
@BTabooli @CSLowrie1 @brithume Neither are contradictions. 		Do you even understand what a contradiction is?
@BTabooli @CSLowrie1 @brithume Not remember how she got home is not a contradiction		Leland Keyser said she didn't remember party, why would she if it wasn't traumatic. 		No contradictions there.
@BTabooli @CSLowrie1 @brithume Yeah, and the woman that he claimed she prepped denied that that occurred.		Where's the proof about crdt Card?
@Future_Prof10 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump If he cuts off funds to Honduras they'll probably kick us out of the country and that would be devastating to our drug trafficking program since it's the only base in Central America.
@stamos_tpusa @FoxNews Good one. Very clever!
@KMWIA96 @RealJamesWoods Yeah, now he flies all over the country on the taxpayers' dime all to enrich himself.
@RealJamesWoods "works"!	He barely ever "works" before noon. 	FYI: we haven't forgotten he wasn't your 1st, 2nd, or even 3rd choice.
@BTabooli @CSLowrie1 @brithume What contradicting stuff exactly?
@maggieNYT thanks for your "both sides do it", Maggie.
@TuckerCarlson Since you guys haven't figured it out yet, trump is a globalist and the only thing he cares about is enriching himself.
@chickybird949 @SaraCarterDC Let me guess, you didn't read the article before you commented, right?
@KSTiLLS Not in Miami  you don't.
@konhld @TomiLahren Because I'm an American citizen and my stay there was always temporary. I volunteered at a catholic orphanage and my wife was the psychologist.
@konhld @TomiLahren Did I say that gangs wouldn't target women in Honduras? I'm going to guess that I have slightly better insight into the country than you since I lived there for 3 years, my wife is from there, my 2 kids were born in Tegucigalpa and my suegra lives in SPS.
@konhld @TomiLahren Because they are the primary targets of gangs. They have two choices 1) join the gang 2) be killed by the gang.		Any other questions?
@XAVIFERN_AFC @MZHemingway I agree that trump voters are sexist degenerates.
@MZHemingway Yeah, except all the info that will come out during Democratic lead investigations to include his taxes.
@foxnewspolitics @AdamShawNY @JuddBerger If only he'd suffer the same fate as Eddard.
@RealCandaceO Yeah, that's moronic. Hey Candace, who's paying for your #BLEXIT$$?
@konhld @TomiLahren I know I'm dealing with an uneducated Fox News viewer so allow me;		Chicago isn't even in the top 20 most violent cities in the US. Honduras is the most violent country in the western hemisphere.
@konhld @TomiLahren If you don't already know about the violence in Central America then you're beyond helping. Maybe you should stop watching Fox News and inform yourself about what's going on in the world.
@MZHemingway Why is it horrible? She was suffering and it was her choice to end her life.
@xdiamonddustx @GenMhayden don't fookin say it.		https://t.co/kXCO1tQEwm
@HixsonButch @SamuelCantu @FoxNews @RichEdsonDC Yeah, except Congress voted to give him the power to make the agreement as long as they could review it. Seriously, are all Cons as ignorant as you? 		https://t.co/xUbkRcEhPb
@konhld @TomiLahren Guess you haven't been paying attention.
@JRehling @realDonaldTrump Don't forget to boycott Scion Hotels.
@RealCandaceO Hey Candace, who is funding your #BLEXIT?
@TomiLahren Jesus would be so proud of your lack of compassion for those fleeing violence.
@FullFrontalSamB We need another trump wedding.
@NRO @RichLowry What's not originalist about "well regulated"?
@IngrahamAngle @WSJ To quote trump: "Fake numbers! trump's gubmint is fabricating the numbers to make him look good!"
@weeklystandard It's almost as if fabricating false accusations is really, really difficult to pull off.
@GossiTheDog "girlfriend"
@exeter_acres @RedState Great point! Sent from your Made in China computer.	Where are the same sanctions on Saudi Arabia, Russia, Egypt, Turkey, Philippines, etc...?
@AriFleischer Got a legit source of this?
@MaryEbth @FoxNews Yeah, but he WANTS to tell the truth!!1!
@exeter_acres @RedState Better question is why do we still have an embargo on Cuba??
@RudyGiuliani I can only hope Rudy G. is handling trump's legal issues as well as he's dishing out endorsements.
@brianbeutler they hurt his approval rating too. Won't someone think of poor Donny!
@seanhannity Only dopes still trust O'keefe.
@tridentjohn @amber_athey @DailyCaller What'd they miss? Anything important or just trump sucking oxygen out of the room?
@CarlDBradley @amber_athey @DailyCaller No need to edit.
@amber_athey And if he announces anything then they'll cover it.
trump's mother Mary Anne wasn't a citizen until 1942 , she gave birth to trump's older sister Maryanne in 1937.		#BirthrightCitizenship
@dannydanon @nikkihaley How does the embargo on Cuba make the world a safer place?
@JohnCornyn Got a source they need the cartels' permission or did you read it on Breitbart?
@markknoller Don't those bums have jobs?
@FoxNews Too bad that never happened at Fox News.
@Cindy78774015 @SaraCarterDC Yeah, except DACA wasn't an EO.
@SaraCarterDC Anyone else remember Cons losing their minds when Obama issued EOs,?		Hypocrites.
@realDonaldTrump It's 2:30 PM and your lazy ass isn't working yet. Get to work, you bum!
@logicrules2 @FoxNews @POTUS @edhenry @foxnewsnight I like your cross. Do you think Jesus would be proud of you are rejecting those that are seeking refuge?
RT @MaddowBlog: They say that Dodge City voters can't vote in their usual polling location because it is inaccessible due to construction.…
@markknoller Buying votes. Pathetic.
@ddale8 does trump know about all the Russians doing just that at his properties?
@RealCandaceO Candace, who is funding your Blexit?
@AnnetteFm3050 @foxnewspolitics @AdamShawNY Everything, huh? Care to name a couple things he's rebelled on? Thanks.
@mj1356 @foxnewspolitics @AdamShawNY Let's see if you can give two examples of Ryan caving to the Dems.
@foxnewspolitics @AdamShawNY trump know cuz his chain migration momma gave birth to his older sister before his momma was a citizen. Same with Melanie and Barron.
@R4ND4LL_H @KimStrassel I'm sure trump siding with Saudi Arabia over Qatar is a factor.
@KimStrassel According to the Taliban spokesperson. 		Yeah, ok.
@seanmdav @AndrewCMcCarthy Something something "well regulated", amiright?
@realDonaldTrump It's 12:45 and you're still tweeting instead of work. Get to work you lazy bum!
@benshapiro Hondurans are escaping extreme violence but they're the wrong color Christians so Evangelicals couldn't care less about them.
@RealCandaceO Have you apologized to Ye yet or did he block your number?
@LarrySt95640422 @MZHemingway I guess they're in cahoots with the Repubs.
@LarrySt95640422 @MZHemingway That's a pretty sweet Catch-22 she's got there.
@NatashaBertrand @KimStrassel She's an opinion writer not a journalist, so, no, she has no clue.
@MZHemingway What are your thoughts on moron Jacob Wohl's idiotic attempt to frame Mueller? See how quick that fell apart, yet not one con media journalist was capable of finding anything similar about Kavanaugh accusers.
@MZHemingway You'll be eating your words when Dems take control of the House.  Right now they have no power to investigate but they will starting in January.
@Smoakinguy @lone_wolf_369 @amyanda1 @RealCandaceO Amazing that instead of linking a single article to back up your claim you'd rather engage in "No, you!"		I get it, you're incapable of anything except platitudes and regurgitation. 		Buenas noches!
@Smoakinguy @lone_wolf_369 @amyanda1 @RealCandaceO Yeah, except you've failed to provide any evidence to back up a single one of your claims. I'll give you another chance to provide evidence of "legislation to combat the opioid epidemic" that republicans passed and trump signed (unfunded EOs don't count).
@Smoakinguy @lone_wolf_369 @amyanda1 @RealCandaceO You mean like the ignorant claims that you made? thanks for being in agreement.
@dkass @stefiamico @niaplatt2 @KimStrassel @Ike197077 Literally says he has the legal authority to prosecute. This "stefi" has zero clue.
@stefiamico @dkass @niaplatt2 @KimStrassel @Ike197077 Wait. The special counsel isn't a prosecutor? Better tell Manafort that before his sentencing.
@mitchellvii From Mexico?
@markknoller Hey Mark, who is paying for all this travel?
@politicalelle What a moronic tweet. 	FYI: Ben and Jerry are Jews.
@seanhannity You plan on reporting on Jacob Wohl tonight?
@Jeffery14386981 @EveODestruction @sheadyacres @thekahoona @benshapiro I should start with the basics and see if you can explain what socialism is. 		FYI: sent from your Made in China computer.
@Jeffery14386981 @EveODestruction @sheadyacres @thekahoona @benshapiro So saying that one cop 'acted stupidly" is evidence that he vilified cops? Damn, your worldview is warped. 	I noticed that you left out that he held a beer summit to smooth things over. Typical.
@JonahNRO Yeah, except that Obama never issued an EO on DACA.
@johncardillo @jaketapper Hey John, remember when you blamed Obama and Clinton for cops being killed? To use your words, trump owns this. 		https://t.co/vzzZwNKMEv
@Smoakinguy @lone_wolf_369 @amyanda1 @RealCandaceO Someone doesn't understand "burden of proof". You make the claim, provide evidence not platitudes.
@TomiLahren Agreed. Deport Michelle Malkin. Deport Barron trump
@Smoakinguy @lone_wolf_369 @amyanda1 @RealCandaceO If he has signed something then feel free to link the legislation. In the meantime I'll believe govtrack over some rando that is incapable of providing specifics. 		I bet you can't/ won't link legislation. (Trump's unfunded EO isn't a bill)
@Smoakinguy @lone_wolf_369 @amyanda1 @RealCandaceO Yes you are. But at least you can scream "Freedom!!! Liberty!!!" to the other MAGAts.
@Smoakinguy @lone_wolf_369 @amyanda1 @RealCandaceO Do tell which legislation got passed?		https://t.co/FgWqQ9VmCM
@GameofLifeNtert @dricard1968 @RealCandaceO My bad, I google what you wrote and that was the top hit.		You still haven't produced a link to back up your claim that it's at a all time high due to Republican policies.
@Smoakinguy @lone_wolf_369 @amyanda1 @RealCandaceO And you're horrible at providing concrete examples to back up your platitudes. 		Fact: black unemployment was halved under Obama but RWs like to credit trump for the last percentage point but can't explain how other than "Freedom!!! Liberty!!!"
@GameofLifeNtert @dricard1968 @RealCandaceO How does that link confirm your claim that black owned businesses are up 400%?
@Smoakinguy @amyanda1 @lone_wolf_369 @RealCandaceO Ooh, a FB video. It must be trew!!
@amyanda1 @Smoakinguy @lone_wolf_369 @RealCandaceO No, I didn't ignore any of the NONSPECIFIC things you noted. Making a plan to have a plan to plan prison reform is NOT a concrete example of something republicans have accomplished to help the black community. Sorry if you don't understand that.
@GameofLifeNtert @dricard1968 @RealCandaceO Can you provide a source?
@Smoakinguy @lone_wolf_369 @amyanda1 @RealCandaceO https://t.co/wZxxN3eFy4
@Smoakinguy @lone_wolf_369 @amyanda1 @RealCandaceO hmmm, so what do you credit for the massive decrease in black unemployment under Obama?
@Smoakinguy @lone_wolf_369 @amyanda1 @RealCandaceO " legislation to combat the opioid epidemic"	Which one since there hasn't been anything that's passed and signed?		https://t.co/FgWqQ9VmCM
@Smoakinguy @lone_wolf_369 @amyanda1 @RealCandaceO Which prescription drug legislation was passed and signed?
@Smoakinguy @lone_wolf_369 @amyanda1 @RealCandaceO I fail to see how any of those are policies specific to the black community and if you mean increasing our trade deficit as "kicking ass" then I've got nothing for you.
@amyanda1 @Smoakinguy @lone_wolf_369 @RealCandaceO Yes, I'm willfully blind for asking for specifics which you've yet to provide.
@anthonystauffer @JeffFlake What are you talking about?? He took a stand on twitter and probably furrowed his brow!
@FalwenJo @MaysDaizy @RealCandaceO There are currently 50 African Americans in Congress; how many do you think are Republicans?
@FalwenJo @MaysDaizy @RealCandaceO Wrong. Southern Democrats and Republicans fought to keep segregation legal. Northern Democrats fought for the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts.		How many black republicans are in Congress now?
@amyanda1 @Smoakinguy @lone_wolf_369 @RealCandaceO So in your opinion, trump meeting with black conservatives is a concrete policy that makes their lives better? 		All I'm asking is for you to provide specifics which you've failed to do.
@seanmdav Cite your sources.
@simonamangiante I only mock you for marrying a traitor.
@seanhannity Glad to see this lazy POS finally got off her ass and started to earn her paycheck.
@dricard1968 @RealCandaceO Yeah, I called it that you wouldn't provide a link.	You RW dopes are so predictable.
@Smoakinguy @lone_wolf_369 @amyanda1 @RealCandaceO You didn't respond with substance to my original question; all you did was express platitudes. "Liberty!!! Freedom!!!" are not policies so again I ask, what policies are Republicans implementing to make black Americans' lives better?
@dricard1968 @RealCandaceO Where's the link, "genious"?
@dricard1968 @RealCandaceO I'm sorry, where's the link supporting your claim?
@mb141bar Oooohhhh, a quote on a pic. It must be real. Thanks. https://t.co/0CPF6u5vQD
@dricard1968 @RealCandaceO Oh, there's proof of higher approval? Let's see if you can link it? 		(You won't because you're a 1st Class gullible dope)
@dricard1968 @RealCandaceO ME NO LIKE FACTS ME CALL YOU NAMES!1  		And you wonder why we all think you're a bunch of brain dead morons. 	Presented with verifiable facts and your response is "nothuh!!"
@amyanda1 @lone_wolf_369 @Smoakinguy @RealCandaceO Yeah, that's not how the 3 strike law works if you think it's for minor crimes. Also, Kushner is a life long Democrat. 		However, none of that has been accomplished yet so what have republicans done (concrete examples please) to make life better for black Americans?
@mb141bar @magsster1 Seek help before trump gets rid of your medicaid.
@mb141bar @magsster1 Yeah, except she was mocking the interviewer that confused Holder and Booker. I know that context doesn't matter to you GED recipients but try harder.
@EAHeart @jgrissom63 @RealCandaceO @terrydvl @realDonaldTrump Connect my comment to the comment I responded to. Let me be clear; there are basically no minorities showing up to trump rallies  so OP's question was a moot one. 	Too bad I had to explain that to you.
@amyanda1 @lone_wolf_369 @Smoakinguy @RealCandaceO Ok. How about it. What specifically have republicans done? 	Hint; meeting with Kanye hasn't accomplished anything.
@dricard1968 @RealCandaceO I see. The BLS graph that trump uses to brag about unemployment rates for blacks is bullshit. 		Damn, Cons really are that dumb. Slap them in the face with facts and it'll do no good.
@Jeffery14386981 @EveODestruction @sheadyacres @thekahoona @benshapiro Sent from your Made in China computer. Strange that a world traveler such as yourself fails to invoke countries such as France, the UK, Denmark, Germany, Norway, etc... but instead use Venezuela. Maybe do your own research. 	Still waiting on the Obama cop rhetoric. Thanks.
@Smoakinguy @RealCandaceO Hmmm, higher incarceration of blacks in republican controlled states doesn't sound like Freedumb!!! Liberty!!! to me. 		https://t.co/yNwNXtKAAY
@dricard1968 @RealCandaceO OK, which republican policies caused that?		Point out on the graph where trump took over.		https://t.co/wZxxN3eFy4
@jgrissom63 @RealCandaceO @terrydvl @realDonaldTrump Ever scan the crowd at trump rallies for non-whites? Few and far between.
@RealCandaceO Hey Candace, what have republicans done for the black community?
@Jeffery14386981 @EveODestruction @sheadyacres @thekahoona @benshapiro Top 5% and can't even bother to check the source of your quote. What a dope. You quoted Henry David Thoreau, not a founding father. 	And you wonder why we call you ignorant.
@Jeffery14386981 @EveODestruction @sheadyacres @thekahoona @benshapiro Do tell, what does Venezuela have to do with the US? But first, where's that Obama police rhetoric quote you promised me?
@Jeffery14386981 @EveODestruction @sheadyacres @thekahoona @benshapiro TIL that Henry David Thoreau was a founding father (he wasn't).		And you wonder why I don't buy your bullshit talking points; you're a sheep that's incapable of researching.
@Jeffery14386981 @EveODestruction @sheadyacres @thekahoona @benshapiro OMG, you must feel so persecuted, 14386981
@Jeffery14386981 @EveODestruction @sheadyacres @thekahoona @benshapiro Nah, ever heard of burden of proof? You make the claim, you provide the actual evidence or be prepared to be called out by someone that doesn't buy your bullshit.

@Jeffery14386981 @EveODestruction @sheadyacres @thekahoona @benshapiro Sure thing, 14386981
@Jeffery14386981 @EveODestruction @sheadyacres @thekahoona @benshapiro 100's, huh? Let's see you provide a source this time even though I'm still waiting for the Obama cop rhetoric first.

@Jeffery14386981 @EveODestruction @sheadyacres @thekahoona @benshapiro You're the dope that brought up Holder when I asked you to defend your comment about Obama.
@Jeffery14386981 @EveODestruction @sheadyacres @thekahoona @benshapiro Thanks for admitting  you use multiple accounts.
@BattyBlogger @gupwalla @pattilangdon191 @DeliaMacD1 @DRUDGE Or maybe his calling out repulsive behavior.

@Jeffery14386981 @EveODestruction @sheadyacres @thekahoona @benshapiro Again, what rhetoric about cops since that was what I was responding too. 		FYI: I know all them darkies look a like but Obama ≠ Holder. OK?
@Jeffery14386981 @EveODestruction @sheadyacres @thekahoona @benshapiro FYI: the IRS wasn't used against cons, they targeted progressive groups too. Bet Hannity didn't tell you about that though.		https://t.co/ysXhwxkfS7
@Jeffery14386981 @EveODestruction @sheadyacres @thekahoona @benshapiro Yeah, I asked for his rhetoric about cops. Keep up. Got any examples of those?
@EveODestruction @sheadyacres @thekahoona @Jeffery14386981 @benshapiro Yeah, you're capable of regurgitating talking points but are a jackass when it comes to providing actual proof.

@EveODestruction @sheadyacres @thekahoona @Jeffery14386981 @benshapiro Yeah, that's what I thought. RW sheep that spews talking points but incapable of providing actual evidence.

@Mister_T_Bone trump went to Murphysboro, IL to campaign after condemning US citizens to death in Pittsburgh. How can anyone consider voting for him?!
@nativetxanj @Clickman8 trump witnessed murder in Pittsburgh...flew to Illinois afterwards.
@sparkygreg Dear trump: Being president is not game, people died in #Pittsburgh and you went to Murphysboro, IL.
@manateec31 How can trump live with himself after 11 dead men in Pittsburgh. Woudl rather go to a campaign rally in Illinois. Our future is done if he is elected.
@RosieOnTheRight Man, you must be pissed that trump held a rally THE DAY 11 elderly Jews were slaughtered while at their temple, right?
@cajunkate @jimpook I'm curious what you think about trump holding a rally after 11 elderly Jews were slaughtered in Pittsburgh?
@AriFleischer Then why are trump and his sycophants  fear mongering about ISIS being in the caravan? Open your eyes.
@MZHemingway Yeah, that's accurate reporting. Stop defending the indefensible.
@maggieNYT Because there is a tweet for everything, trump criticized Pres. Obama for attending a rally the day after BENGHAZI!!!		https://t.co/Lh57VF0f5s

@TomiLahren @seanhannity @FoxNews Send those useless twats back to South Dakota!
@AppleEssential @FoxNews Avenatti is loving it since the FBI was barred from talking to his client during their "investigation". This isn't good for Kavanaugh.
@ddale8 Just imagine the RW outrage if Clinton was in office and Fox News and trump received package bombs and she decided to hold her 5th rally in 7 days.
@JeffPassage Like I said, Jesus would be so proud of what his flock has become. You'd reject him if he showed up with this caravan and that's just pathetic. 		FYI: I lived in Honduras for 3 years and know what these people are escaping. Maybe try some empathy.
@JeffPassage @FoxNews Since when is seeking asylum illegal?
@JeffPassage In case you were too lazy to look up the name of the magazine it's called "America: The Jesuit Review".		Again I ask, what kind of Christian are you if you have no sympathy and desire to help these people? Jesus would weep at what his flock has become.
@JeffPassage Let me guess, you're too lazy to click and see how authored the piece. Allow me;		https://t.co/3JVq2FNAnF
@JeffPassage No one, huh?		https://t.co/F8mOqpNWpJ
@JeffPassage @FoxNews Glad to see you claim to be Christian but are unwilling to help those most in need.
@JeffPassage @FoxNews What kind of dope doesn't think that people fleeing from violence aren't refugees? 	Since Jesus was the only one in danger perhaps the newborn should have walked to Egypt on his own.		You have absolute shit logic.
@Hagomaga @FoxNews Seek help.
@JeffPassage @FoxNews Great. Then you know that Joseph, Mary, and Jesus fled Israel for Egypt because of risk to their lives (refugees).		Maybe you should try reading the Bible again.
@JeffPassage Do tell how it violates your Biblical principles? 		I'd ask for proof of your claim of who is financing the caravan but I already know that 1) you're incapable of providing any proof 2) you'll change the subject.
@JeffPassage Refugees can return home, dope! Seriously, try educating yourself before proving your ignorance.
@Fortyacrefan @FoxNews Yeah, rich people walk 2,500 miles to get to the states.
@SaraCarterDC TIL that people organizing a peaceful march are criminals.

@JeffPassage @FoxNews Learn your Bible: 		Matthew 2:13	https://t.co/Fmm23HEh3X
@JeffPassage @FoxNews Jesus was a refugee!
@lizaperri @FoxNews What are the odds that these are people fleeing extreme violence?
@FoxNews Hey all you fake Christians, these Christians are trying to escape extreme poverty and violence, why aren't you helping them? Jesus would be ashamed of what his Evangelical flock has become.
@Kathryncramer4 @marcorubio Noticed that you "love God", tell me, you think God wants you to help your fellow Christians? 	You'd probably have the National Guard mow down Jesus if he tried seeking asylum in the US.
@Kathryncramer4 @marcorubio Sorry, I didn't realize that you're a fucking whacko conspiracy theorist. Ever been to Honduras? You honestly think that these people are escaping extreme violence and poverty to affect the midterms? Yeah, you're a dope.
@Kathryncramer4 @marcorubio You know that seeking asylum is legal, right?
@CBreasbois @sequinpants @markknoller Yeah, I'll stick with the news source and not a biased campaign manager. 	Don't confuse knowledgeable with angry, that'd be foolish.

@Gracefu14685325 @BarackObama @K94Annie He wasn't beheaded while Obama golfed. He was beheaded days to weeks beforehand but ISIS released the video, jackass.
@MediaEthicsGuy Probably because neither of those presidents called journalists "the enemy of the people" and made them a target.
@smnelson57 @ChrisCuomo but but but Obama!		I'm assuming that you're equally outraged that Trump went golfing after finding out about Jamal's death, right?
@RealCandaceO And which states do they live in? Why aren't Republicans giving them attention?
@propter_vocem @Buffaloexpat @BretBaier @benshapiro And what manner should that be, one that you approve of?

@markknoller @LukeAFB Weary? All he did yesterday was hold a rally. Low energy!
@Scavino45 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @PHXSkyHarbor Hey Dan, who is paying for this campaign trip?
@costareports @JeffFlake furrow the brow.
@FoxNews @POTUS @foxnewsnight How much is this costing the taxpayers? 3 days of rallies! What a lazy POS.
@IngrahamAngle Glad you've got time for this but absolutely nothing on the murder of the Saudi journalist that trump is helping to cover up.
@FoxNews @EricTrump @HillaryClinton @IngrahamAngle This piece of shit said that democrats aren't even human and he's crying about the left not being civil? STFU, eric!
@NoahShachtman He's always been a rat faced douche.
@statedeptspox Did you pass by trump's former hotel? 		https://t.co/zVDTyD8wLp
@GOPLeader @NancyPelosi If republicans are for building the wall why haven't they given trump all the money he's requested?
@DevilorAngel53 @sf_anastasia @FoxNews Got a legit source for your sexual assault claim? 	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	I bet you don't
@FoxNews @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump We need to deport illegal immigrant Third Lady Melanie!
@jknoxville @BeerJudge123 @FoxNews I know this, Clinton won 55% of the pledged delegates. In case you no so gud with da maths; 55% &gt; 45%
@PaulDerengowski @sf_anastasia @FoxNews ((())), right?
@DevilorAngel53 @sf_anastasia @FoxNews OMG!!! He gave US THE FINGER!!! He's problem MS13, I heard giving the finger is a gang sign.
@Red5Adam @sf_anastasia @FoxNews Sorry, I don't have time to explain to morons how the drug trade works.
@RyanK12222 @sf_anastasia @FoxNews Oh yeah, which poll is that? I'll need to show it to my Catracha mother in law to let her know that living in the most violent country in the Western hemisphere is no big deal.
@pethamerica @sf_anastasia @FoxNews So you don't think that there are Hondurans living in other countries other than the US? 	In case you only get your limited news from Fox News; Mexico also has a huge violence problem (drug cartels with American consumers).
@patski80 @sf_anastasia @FoxNews How do you think the drug trade works? You think that cartels are cuddly puppies? Unfortunately Central Americans have to suffer for Americans' unquenchable thirst for drugs.
@jknoxville @BeerJudge123 @FoxNews Super Delegates literally had zero effect on the nomination but that's just a fact so you wouldn't care about that.
@TomiLahren Tammy, I bet you claim to be a good god fearing Christian, right?
@sf_anastasia @FoxNews Because Honduras is extremely violent (thanks to the drug trade fueled by Americans) so separation is preferable to having a murdered child.
@markknoller @W7VOA Who's paying for this?
@jknoxville @FoxNews That's quite the attempt at "logic". Sad! Low energy!
@jknoxville @FoxNews What are your thoughts on Jr, Manafort, and Kushner meeting with a Kremlin lawyer at trump tower? Let me guess, you're so much of a naive rube that you think it was only about "adoptions", right?
@FoxNews Who elected Fitton?
@realDonaldTrump Laziest POS ever.
@RealCandaceO Not a single tweet about Kashoggi. How about calling out your GEOTUS for bowing down to terrorists!
@FoxNews @LaraLeaTrump @ShannonBream @foxnewsnight Who's that dude?
@timetravelStu @FoxNews @LaraLeaTrump @foxnewsnight He's got 3 days of rallies starting tomorrow, guaranteed that he riles up the crowd against the media all 3 days.
@Momeaux @maggieNYT Stop commenting without reading the article. You fail YOURSELF.
@TheContemptor What does Tucker have to say about Cuban Canadian Rafael Cruz?
@FoxNews @LaraLeaTrump @FLOTUS Who cares about our illegal alien, birther Third Lady.
@markknoller All on the taxpayers' dime!
@chrodo4real @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Has she even talked about Saudi Arabia yet?
@SenatorCollins Maybe the FBI can do a limited cursory 1 week investigation and get back to you with their findings.
@jillypickley @FDRLST So because you believe that they might be Dems they shouldn't have their rights restored? Yeah, you're a fascist.
@KristyHoeksema @FDRLST Why? You wouldn't have sex with trump just days after his 5th child was born to his 3rd wife?
@FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC @foxnewsnight Give? It was always Iran's money.
@ddale8 Another do nothing day. Shocking. He's got to save his energy for his back to back to back rallies.
@ddale8 2 years later and he's still talking about the election. Wonder how often he regales his staff with his victory?
@SaraCarterDC Nice to see you're focused on the important things and not a single tweet about the Saudis torturing and murdering a fellow journalist.
@FoxNews @POTUS It won't work. He's beyond redemption.
@cttknj @ericaj58 @markknoller @emptywheel @FoxNews You RWNJs really can't stay on topic. Low energy!
@kylegriffin1 He's too busy visiting his properties, that's essential.
@jaketapper Because trump doesn't want the Saudis to boycott his business; they're keeping him afloat.
@BootCamp30Day @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews Looks like your mental health BC isn't working. Maybe try more tinfoil.
@cttknj @markknoller @emptywheel @FoxNews what about what about what about what about what about what about what about what about what about what about what about what about what about what about what about what about what about what about what about Obama and the Clintons!!!
@AC360 You mean he lied? Shocked. I'm waiting for him to deny that they bought his yacht and hotel and an apartment from him.
@ddale8 All he does is give interviews, watch Fox, rallies, and golf. Does he ever work?
@deborah0987654 @markknoller Sure thing 098754
@TomiLahren Hey Tammy, how would a wall stop them when they plan on going to a port of entry to claim asylum?
@statedeptspox @SecPompeo @StateDept Why in the hell is the Airman saluting the Sec of State?
@agearan So Executive Time and rage tweeting all day?
@markknoller That's pretty low energy.
@stephenkruiser You think trump is a truth teller? He literally lies about everything.
@RepSwalwell Did we expect anything less? Trump cares about just one thing: trump.	He knows that the Saudis are keeping his business afloat and he doesn't want to risk sleeping in the streets.
@marcorubio Hey Lil' Marco, remember when you voted "Nay" for Super Storm Sandy relief? Those of us in the northeast remember. 	Bootstraps time, Marco!
@will_mcco @TomiLahren Yeah, defamation but not the major one trying to nullify the NDA.
@betsy_klein NRG Arena has capacity for 8,000; far from the biggest stadium in the state.
@AriFleischer What kind of dope thinks he helped put Kavanaugh on  SCOTUS? Which GOP senators wouldn't have voted yes if Avenatti wasn't involved?
@DavidAFrench How did she mislead her employers if her heritage was never a consideration?
@ClayFragulia @FoxNews 🍄
@TomiLahren Asks "let me get this straight"  but butchers the facts.		You got a single source that she pretended to be NA for benefits?
@16genpatriots @FoxNews @POTUS Q told me you'd say that! WWG!WWGA and you're going to the mental ward. See ya there.
@IngrahamAngle Because republicans would NEVER suppress the vote to their benefit, right?
@16genpatriots @FoxNews @POTUS Sorry. I thought you'd understand my message. Q told me you'd understand!!
@16genpatriots @FoxNews @POTUS Take your fucking meds.
@FoxNews @POTUS trump is a pussy and won't do anything about it. 	Why? 	The Saudis are keeping his business afloat and he cares more about his bank account than the reputation of the US.
@FoxNews @marcorubio trump doesn't want to risk having the Saudis boycott his businesses; he'll never punish them.
@bambakakis @FoxNews Nah, they know trump is a complete pussy.
@DavidJollyFL @realDonaldTrump Don't forget about golf this morning.
@WomanWhoWeaves @maggieNYT Probably because she's a WH correspondent not national politics.
@stephenfhayes Yeah, I'm sure Obama said he knew more about Afghanistan and Al Qaeda than Petraeus.
@FoxNews @POTUS trump thinks that NATO countries owe money to the US, he's a fucking moron and a know nothing.
@FDRLST So you guys consider the Tea Party "mobs" too?
@AOGCLOTHINGCO13 @miketnyc @peersja @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Why does Louisiana have governors if trump believed Obama should be doing their job?
Weekly update (Oct. 14):		Hurricane Michael destroyed parts of Florida and trump topped off a 4 rally week with a round of golf today. Eventually he'll make it down to Florida.	#TCOT https://t.co/5XBSmmItR5
@AOGCLOTHINGCO13 @miketnyc @peersja @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump I believe that hypocrisy is trump complaining about Obama not going and golfing instead. Care to guess what trump was doing today? 		Seriously, you're the prototypical trump supporter; ignorant and proud of it. 	Sad!
@AOGCLOTHINGCO13 @miketnyc @peersja @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Well, where was trump? Why didn't he go before the hurricane? And evacuate everyone?		You're either a lousy troll or a typical dumbass trump supporter.
@AOGCLOTHINGCO13 @miketnyc @peersja @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump On what planet was Obama not president in 2016? Yeah, you clearly don't know what in the hell you are talking about. Here's the tweet:		https://t.co/LIh5HIh7go
@AOGCLOTHINGCO13 @miketnyc @peersja @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Again, will you admit you were wrong when presented with evidence? 		There was no hurricane in 2016, it was persistent rain that caused the flooding and trump complained that Obama didn't visit soon enough.
@AOGCLOTHINGCO13 @miketnyc @peersja @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump I'm curious, will you admit you were wrong when given proof that trump criticized Obama for not going sooner? 		FYI: there was flooding in 2016 that had nothing to do with a hurricane.
@AOGCLOTHINGCO13 @miketnyc @peersja @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump No? You willing to apologize if you're wrong?
@FoxNews @AlanDersh Maybe Harvard should get rid of legacy admissions to make room for students that are truly qualified instead of dopes like Kushner.
@AOGCLOTHINGCO13 @miketnyc @peersja @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump trump complained about Obama not visiting Louisiana fast enough; shouldn't he be held to the same standard?
@Soldier_Cynic @FoxNews @POTUS both
@josemadrigal831 @FoxNews Change your tin foil hat
@Fan4Cal @The_UnSilent_ Any guesses where trump is right now? C'mon, guess! It's Sunday so he's either in church or he's golfing; can you choose correctly?		https://t.co/SYOMV7Tcnz
@Fan4Cal @The_UnSilent_ LOL! an opinion piece from Mark Thiessen is your proof of what? 		FACT: trump has handled disasters horribly; it took more than a year for PR to get power across the island, trump complained that it took Obama a week to help restore power in NY/NJ.
@FoxNews @GOPLeader @MariaBartiromo What a hypocrite coming from someone that blocked every single Obama initiative.
@Fan4Cal @The_UnSilent_ trump has golfed plenty after major hurricanes hit the US. He golfed after Harvey. He golfed after Maria. He golfed after Florence. He's tripled what Obama played at the same point in their presidency (but Obama didn't personally benefit like grifter trump does)
@Estebs1978 @survivor_bob @FoxNews trump expected Obama to go to Louisiana and all you RWNJs complained that he stayed on vacation. I can only imagine the outrage if Obama held 3 campaign rallies and met with Kanye instead.
@Rowdy18F @for_goose @jaketapper @BarackObama Quick question; has trump even toured any parts of California that were devastated by wildfires?
@andy50936831 @AvaMoor34816208 @nwecotours @DsOchoa @realDonaldTrump I'm assuming that you're equally pissed about the amount of golf trump has played since Hurricane Maria and all the campaign rallies this week after Michael, right?
@RaidersNana @JudgeJeanine @dbongino trump kept playing golf with Tiger when ISIS slaughtered 300 people in Egypt. trump has held 3 campaign rallies since Michael destroyed parts of Florida. Where's your outrage?
@theresa_miller3 @StephenKing I don't get your point (do I need to YELL?). Are you saying that it's acceptable that trump has held 3 campaign rallies after Michael destroyed Florida but Obama was bad for remaining on vacation and not heading to LA?
@ianbremmer trump didn't praise Lee?
@GOP @barrforcongress Glad to see trump holding his 3rd rally since Florida was fucked up by Hurricane Michael. What a patreet!
@ddale8 How many drinks do you have after his rallies?
@Heathfeath45 @ddale8 Don't you remember House democrats voting 85 times to repeal their own bill? ??? trump  does!
@FDRLST Why can't I call them blackies the N word?
@mikewarder1 @markknoller @PressSec @HowardKurtz @MajorCBS @seanhannity @IngrahamAngle @ShannonBream @VDHanson Except that not even Fox is airing these garbage rallies anymore.
@SebGorka @EncounterBooks She talk about Cambridge Analytica at all?
@SebGorka @CNN Someone that doesn't have an arrest warrant in Hungary.
@AmbJohnBolton Took trump nearly two years to get him out. Anyone else remember when RWNJs complained that Obama took 6 months to get Tahmooressi released?
@markknoller trump is too busy fundraising and holding rallies to call the King. Sad!
@CBCAElite1 @markknoller Cons hate facts and actual reporting.
@RealCandaceO @seanhannity LOL.
@SenRubioPress Hey Lil' Marco, remember when you voted against Sandy relief? Those of us in the northeast do. Bootstraps time.
@markknoller @POTUS No time for Florida but time for back to back  rallies.
@NRA @realDonaldTrump So the NRA supports UBCs now?
@swimmom0f2 this tweet didn't age well. 		Did anyone tell #trump that he won the election! Stop campaigning &amp; get back to work! Pathetic excuse for a President!
@swimmom0f2 @DailyCaller Great point! So why was trump complaining that Obama was campaigning a week after Sandy? #SmartenUp		https://t.co/kPgOBUvB93
@TheFive @greggutfeld Don't kid yourself, Greg. The right has always been against the PC movement ... until someone offends them.
@NDH_j_m_f Nice defense of trump's overt hypocrisy. Low energy!
@RepMarkMeadows House republicans are meddling with an ongoing investigation and are upset that people won't cooperate.
@NDH_j_m_f Yes, I'm the hypocrite here for pointing out trump's blatant hypocrisy. Shame on me for using trump's past words against him. Sad!
@NDH_j_m_f Oh, I'm sorry. Cons are incapable of recognizing blatant hypocrisy but since you asked.... 	How dare POTUS not pick up a water pump and...?		https://t.co/NSncOKNR2m
@SteveKingIA My 90 year old grammy would love to move to Iowa and pick corn for $6.25/ hr. Where can she sign up?
@seanmdav Your "facts" sound a lot like opinions.
@collagingkriste @jaketapper Yeah, sure that's what they were discussing. Dope
@NDH_j_m_f FYI: trump was bitching a week after the storm had passed.
@NDH_j_m_f I know, right!!		https://t.co/kPgOBUvB93
@DailyCaller Glad to see that trump made time for Kanye in the midst of Hurricane Michael.
@jimsciutto We all know that trump will bend the knee.
@TomiLahren His name was Peter Smith!
@seanhannity What kind of dope still believes anything put out by O'keefe? 		HANNITY is that dope.
@FoxNews That's rich. trump's father was literally his bank.
@FoxNews And trump is out at a campaign rally. Disgusting.
@atrupar You mean the same shitty steal that he buys for his shitty hotels?
@FoxNews @RepDeSantis TIL that the Gov. of Florida has the ability to impeach the president. Does this guy ever stop lying?
@Hughcifer @lorrainehut @FoxNews @POTUS @IvankaTrump I've read the law several times and yet they both have jobs in the WH, correct?  They aren't getting paid, that's the loophole. Senate doesn't confirm all WH jobs. So now I'd like a source to my original question of what prevents them from serving as ambassadors.
@singermarla3 @atrupar Don't forget about this one;		https://t.co/aiiaWgh054
@atrupar Imagine the outrage if Obama had gone to a campaign rally during a Cat. 4 hurricane.
@Acosta Don't those bums have jerbs?
@MichaelAvenatti @ChuckGrassley Same logic that the House Intel Chair is an Iowa dairy farmer.
@MJonHarrell Thoughts on trump constantly vacationing and campaigning and spending his mornings watching Fox News? #JustSaying
@PeterWolfffff hmmm, replace "Obama" with 'trump" and you hit it dead nuts.
@KatiePavlich Did trump take any questions from the press today about Hurricane Michael or did he have to rush to the chopper to make his PA rally?
@KatiePavlich Looks like you made it. Too bad.
@JaySekulow Anyone care to explain how me giving you my email will help this woman?
@FoxNews Where's trump? On his way to another rally that even Fox won't bother to air tonight. Sad! Low energy!
@AxManBill @IngrahamAngle I suppose you could have spent 10 secs googling him to find out that trump appointed him but cons don't like to do the learnin' thingy.
@iadevaia16 @IngrahamAngle And trying to find someone other than trump to blame.
@MJM25Pursuit @IngrahamAngle Why did trump appoint a Democrat to run the Fed? Did the DEEP STATE force him to?
@ReaganWorld @POTUS I thought this was in response to his "tremendous amount of water in terms of rain" insight.
@billhobbs trump is out campaigning today, while Hurricane Michael pummels Florida. https://t.co/LDPj09lEbs Sycophant media will give him a pass.
@billhobbs trump has played triple the amount of golf as Obama in the same time span and I've yet to see a single RWNJ complain about the excessive costs of trump's trips to FL and NJ. 		Why so hypocritical?
@lorrainehut @Hughcifer @FoxNews @POTUS @IvankaTrump They still have jobs in the WH and you've yet to provide a source for your claim that they're ineligible.
@zackpittman @guypbenson @allahpundit @mkhammer Except that she's a hard core conservative.
@guypbenson @allahpundit "LOCK HER UP!!", amirite?
@SometimesSoftly @marcorubio Except that this is a self induced disaster.
@CortesSteve @TaraSetmayer @donlemon @Bakari_Sellers Kanye wants to abolish the 13th Amendment. That's fucking stupid.
@guypbenson Doesn't bode well for Jason Miller.
@DDBJ9033newlife @MZHemingway @jontester You had to google that? Here's my result. https://t.co/Xdi1giGriR
@BBQpolitics @BreitbartNews @MichaelAvenatti @DonaldTrumpJr18 @DonaldJTrumpJr Jr. is a total badass! https://t.co/C3pqGd6r3j
@goldengateblond @hint Looks like an unnecessary environmental problem.
@MZHemingway @jontester to eat.
@realDonaldTrump Nice to see you holding yet another rally while Florida is about to get pummeled by Hurricane Michael.
@WHPublicPool So he's going to yet another campaign rally while Hurricane Michael pummels Florida? Pathetic.
@FoxNews @sseagalofficial @POTUS Wife beater Steven Seagal literally works for Putin; he's paid to say this crap.
@ddale8 trump claimed that he was Swedish for decades (he's not).
@Hughcifer @lorrainehut @FoxNews @POTUS @IvankaTrump Then how does she and the Kush have jobs in the WH? Try again.
@lorrainehut @FoxNews @POTUS @IvankaTrump Got a source that they aren't eligible, I couldn't find anything.
@ARmastrangelo @DePaulU @charliekirk11 @RealCandaceO Private business can do what they want, right?
@marcorubio Why are Blue State taxpayers bailing you guys out?
@billhobbs "President trump, is it appropriate for you to be campaigning while a  hurricane hits the Gulf coast," asked no conservative media today.
@DLoesch Not a problem for trump, he won't let Cat 3 Michael stop him from heading to Iowa tonight.
@IngrahamAngle Thoughts on trump campaigning tonight while Michael is about to hit the US?
@jxc @ggreenwald Who's to say that they have "so very little to say of value".	The Clintons literally hold zero political power. 	Shit logic on your part. 	Again, no one is forcing them to pay the Clintons as GG implied.
@logical_negro @ggreenwald Thanks, Stefan.
@jxc @ggreenwald "Paid" as in willingly given to. GG likes to imply that it was through nefarious means which is not the case at all.
@TomiLahren Imagine that. You're so much of a bigot that you think that legal residents are "illegals".
@ggreenwald What a shit argument. They aren't taking anyone's money.
@TomiLahren That's regulation, Tammy!
@RealCandaceO @taylorswift13 @MarshaBlackburn Look at you try to throw around the race card!
@sheko2265 @DevinNunes @MariaBartiromo Like employing undocumented immigrants instead of Americans at his farm?
@gabrielmalor What about trump and Ingraham?
@IngrahamAngle His WMDs? Nice lie.
Weekly Update (Oct. 7):	another week of rallies and golf.		sources:	https://t.co/6V9Igtkj8S	https://t.co/kf1fyzVQzn		#TrumpGolf 	#Hypocrite	#tcot https://t.co/LlQ2SU6kPh
@amber_athey How much is this vanity trip costing American taxpayers?
@RealKyleMorris @realDonaldTrump trump lied about being German for decades, claims he was Swedish, then complains about Warren. #Hypocrite
@thehill No 1A in Texas?
@realDonaldTrump How much are we paying for these vanity rallies?
@takerealrisks @thehill @NBCNews No, not even close to being the same thing.
@takerealrisks @thehill @NBCNews No, he didn't work for NBC News, he worked for an NBC affiliate.
@IngrahamAngle Again I ask, what in the hell does due process have to do with a job interview?
@kimberlyljones7 @summayerle @Sen_JoeManchin What does the electoral college have to do with electing a Senator?
@IngrahamAngle @SenatorCollins what does due process have to do with a job interview?
@IngrahamAngle @lisamurkowski I'm confused, what does due process have to do with the Kavanaugh vote?
@joanwalsh @lisamurkowski @Sen_JoeManchin He's not overriding her vote though. If she's the only Republican "No" vote then it's still 50-50 and Pence breaks the tie. Now if he votes to confirm if Collins and Murkowski both vote "No" then he's overriding their votes.
@DiannaJ007 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Does he ever work?
@WHPublicPool Yet another do nothing day.
@BraylenNapier @connormartinezz @FoxNews @BarackObama @BetoORourke @SenWarren @SenSanders Then you don't understand how politics is played. If he endorses Beto then Rafael Cruz uses that in ads.
@Fahrenthold I hope when it's all over that trump is using a curb for a pillow.
@trichardpdx @Fahrenthold @realDonaldTrump It's more than likely that trump's businesses are violating the emoluments clause.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Yet another rally. Remember when you RWNJs complained about Obama doing this (not as frequent as trump)?
@68lilsavage @FoxNews @therealroseanne "In their time of troubles"? Stop supporting bigots.
@JaySekulow How does giving you my email protect the cross?
@FoxNews @FLOTUS You guys changed your tune. I remember you RWNJs freaking out at the cost of Michelle Obama's trip to Africa. Where's your outrage now?
@rebeccaballhaus Remember when he complained about Obama campaigning too much! 44 never wasted that much time compared to trump.		https://t.co/xEH6oDqJN3
@DavidWright_CNN @marcorubio @maritavlachou It's crazy and complicated for a reason, wealthy people want loopholes and they weren't put there by poor people.
@MediaDrool @RealCandaceO Excuse me! You said you trust statements that are given under oath so you must trust Dr. Blasey Ford's statement, right? (I have to ask a second time because you got cornered by your own argument and refused to answer my question)
@MediaDrool @RealCandaceO I trust that he likes beer. Do you like beer MediaDrool?
@MediaDrool @RealCandaceO So you trust Ford's statement to the Senate while under oath too?
@RealCandaceO Following your logic; what are the odds that Blasey Ford correctly named several of the people that were at that party BEFORE Kavanaugh released his calendar and confirmed it?
@LSATtutor @seanmdav "Go to" not "went to". See and understand the difference?
@seanmdav We have no idea the exact number of people at the party. Kavanaugh's calendar entry was entered before the party, not afterwards; who's to say they all attended and/ or remained when the girls showed up.
@KimStrassel Put it out there? I've yet to see any media reporting that he was arrested and it was expunged. Nice try.
@mschlapp You heard it here, folks. Matt Schlapp is all about having a conservative Supreme Court even if that means mocking victims of sexual assault. 		Jesus is so proud.
@Sparkymannz @nytimes @NZMorningReport The irony.		https://t.co/7amFDKPkXy
@jerweber @FoxNews @POTUS Yeah, but besides actual facts, we're respected again!!1!
@FoxNews @POTUS Something...something..."LOCK HER UP!"
@AriFleischer @emilybazelon Hey Ari, thank you for admitting that Republicans are actively trying to disenfranchise people. You're not supposed to say it out loud.
@SaraCarterDC Says the "journalist" that kept insisting that selectively released text messages were smoking guns. Queen of disinformation but at least Hannity gave you fame.
@MZHemingway I'm glad that you find a SC justice nominee lying under oath about his drinking to be "pretty funny".
@denisear2017 @RealCandaceO May be a little easier? I'm curious if you know people that live in absolute poverty and have little to know chance of escaping it?
@RealCandaceO I never sued a city because people made racist comments; if you were truly equal you wouldn't have been verbally attacked.
@rsrap4 @tim_ctmac54 @KatrinaPierson You don't expect them to read the articles that they link, do you?
@KatrinaPierson Hey dope, Democrats pushed for the Civil Rights act and the Party of Lincoln is not the party of trump. Stop stealing clothes and start reading history books.
@jpodhoretz Might not be hilarious but most certainly the truth.
@RichLowry The accusation was based on the fact that he had a drinking problem and the incident at the bar is further proof. You know this but like to misinform your followers.
@RameshPonnuru Clinton was literally accused of being a murderer, did you ever see her be hysterical?
@AAC0519 @reason The $16/ hour is literally regulation.
@WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump Even Fox News couldn't be bothered to air the rally.
@realDonaldTrump Don't those bums have jerbs?
@reason @kanyewest Wrong. He wants to get rid of private (for profit) prisons which literally has zero to do with the 13th Amendment. The dope couldn't take 5 minutes to research before proving his ignorance.
@JerryFalwellJr @JeffFlake Good luck getting into heaven (not that grifters are true believers).
@NBCNews What are the odds that trump doesn't do shit!
@newtgingrich @POTUS Crazy. They must have learned from your witch hunt in the 90's. If only Clinton let you sit up front with the VIPs on AF One.
@irritated_chap @FoxNews @POTUS @USArmy Sorry, conservaturds don't understand sarcasm and mockery.
@RealCandaceO Keep making it about race, CO! (it's not)
@irritated_chap @FoxNews @POTUS @USArmy Oh, so trump didn't claim that he'd run unarmed into SDHS to save the kids? My bad.
@FoxNews @POTUS @USArmy That's nothing. I bet trump would have rushed into the battle (unarmed) and saved more people.
@RealCandaceO @ChrisEvans Look at you make this about race.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Remember when you RW idiots would complain about Obama campaigning? Where's your outrage now?
@MZHemingway @AaronBlake Shhhh, shouldn't you be watching guys hit on women in bars.
@JohnCornyn Hey Cornyn,		https://t.co/ATnxxxz93A
@JohnCornyn Republicans accused Clinton of being a murderer and she sat and testified for 11 hours without being hysterical.
@RealCandaceO @ChrisEvans Keep playing the race card, CO.
@RealCandaceO @LanaDelRey @ChrisEvans Nah, they just think he's a fucking moron for wanting to abolish the 13th Amendment.
@jimgeraghty Get Judge under oath in front of the FBI and let's see what he has to say.
@RepMarkMeadows @POTUS @realDonaldTrump A job well done? So you've seen the details already?
@NimbleNavgater I'm assuming you're equally pissed off at Third Lady Melanie's trip to Africa, right?
@FDRLST Yeah, who believes that garbage article from an anonymous source?
@JohnCornyn trump is paying his lawyers from campaign donations and I believe that Rudy G. is working for free. You outraged?
@JohnCornyn And?
@JohnCornyn if only you cared about investigating the allegations as much as the leaks.
@JuDigitalbeats @_QW3R7Y_ @treythedank @light6kin @kanyewest Therefore it doesn't need to be revoked in order for prison reform to advance.
@JuDigitalbeats @_QW3R7Y_ @treythedank @light6kin @kanyewest The 13th Amendment literally has nothing to do with private prisons.
@_QW3R7Y_ @treythedank @light6kin @kanyewest You honestly think he cares about workers? He could easily make his overpriced products in the states but he chooses to exploit foreigners. 		https://t.co/jT2vgUagYL
@_QW3R7Y_ @treythedank @light6kin @kanyewest Then maybe Kanye should tweet that instead of talking about abolishing the 13th Amendment. Stop defending his idiocy.
@_QW3R7Y_ @treythedank @light6kin @kanyewest It takes a special kind of stupid to want to abolish the amendment that abolish slavery.
@treythedank @light6kin @kanyewest He has no idea what he wants. It's moronic to say he wants to abolish the 13th amendment.
@RichLowry Republicans called Hillary Clinton a murderer and she sat through an 11 hour grilling and didn't lose her composure. Kavanaugh is too hysterical to be a Justice on the SC.
@RealCandaceO @kanyewest @nbcsnl What a snowflake.
@NRO Keep trying to polish that turd.
@DBloom451 @BarackObama Kim developed his ICBM on trump's watch but go ahead and blame others. FYI: trump and kim are in love now!
@dr_palazzolo @realDonaldTrump this tweet aged well.
@TomiLahren Hey Tammy, she's not going to give a nobody more attention.
@KimStrassel Is he being factual? Then what's the problem?
@KimStrassel Care to comment on his post rather than attack him?
@NRO And?
@NRO Either way, she named several boys who were there and Kavanaugh made a huge deal about not drinking during the week. July 1, 1982 was a Thursday.
@NRO Lazy writing on NRO's part. She could have gotten there before or after those boys had arrived or left AND as written it says "go to" not "went to" so the plan was for them to show up and maybe they didn't.
@rumpfshaker Hey look, a squirrel!
@KSPBHenri @eclecticbrotha @mschlapp You mean the crap I imagine like that the Clintons are behind the attack on Kavanaugh? 		This guy is supposed to be a neutral judge but is making wild accusations. 	Totally unfit to be on SC.
@KSPBHenri @eclecticbrotha @mschlapp Well if you listened to Kavanaugh's opening statement he blamed the investigation and accusations on the Clintons. That's textbook conspiracy theory.
@FoxNews @POTUS Then why can't they talk to the 3rd accuser if they have free rein?
@FoxNews @POTUS another day of golf and campaign rallies. Remember when you RWNJs attacked Obama for doing it less than trump is?
@KSPBHenri @eclecticbrotha @mschlapp "Who controls their plans, I wouldn't know."	So a conspiracy theory. Thanks for the confirmation.
@KSPBHenri @eclecticbrotha @mschlapp So the Clinton are out to get him?
@borseth @eclecticbrotha @mschlapp Which Dem senators have treated him terribly? Please be specific in what they did too (hint: using a credible claim that he sexually assaulted someone is not "terrible")
@mschlapp And you guys will rally behind him yet again.
@mschlapp Don't worry. Alabama will nominate yet another child molester.
@FoxNews @johnfund @FoxNewsOpinion So conservatives want to use the Kavanaugh hearing as a way to disenfranchise more voters. Fascists.
@NRO Maybe if she got to finish her cross questioning of Kavanaugh she'd have a different answer. She zeroed in on the July 1 entry, the cmte took a break and she wasn't heard from.
@HiHoTheMerryO @billebersole @KimStrassel Felicidades. 90% of your district voted for Clinton so buena suerte en 2020.
@HiHoTheMerryO @billebersole @KimStrassel K, te creo!
@maxwil2 @billebersole @KimStrassel Yeah, that's a bot's post. Whatadope!
@billebersole @KimStrassel No, Latinos tend to vote Democrat because Republicans ostracize them and make them the enemy. Maybe if R's had the ability to be compassionate and reach out to different communities Latinos would vote R but fortunately Rs are just too stupid and cruel.
@KimStrassel Yeah, an anonymously written letter in The Federalist. What dope believes this crap?
@MZHemingway Hopefully you don't have a daughter that needs support if she's assaulted cuz her mom is a douche.
@MZHemingway Aren't you classy.
@RealCandaceO @JRubinBlogger Care to explain the July 1 entry on Kavanaugh's calendar that matches up perfectly with Dr. Ford's allegation?
@JerryFalwellJr @realDonaldTrump Jesus would be so proud of his grifters.
@NKY_Mike @alexiadaley1 @CareyKGreen @cooler2394 @RealCandaceO Still no legit source. Color me surprised.
@NKY_Mike @alexiadaley1 @CareyKGreen @cooler2394 @RealCandaceO SOUTHERN Democrats who then switched to Republicans. 		"Republicans entice them with freedom."		LOL, cons are so gullible.
@NKY_Mike @alexiadaley1 @CareyKGreen @cooler2394 @RealCandaceO Still no legit source. Color me surprised.
@TomiLahren She's not about to give some nobody publicity, Tammy.
@NKY_Mike @alexiadaley1 @CareyKGreen @cooler2394 @RealCandaceO Better? Take a look at the Dem "Nay" votes 95% came from Southerners. Now, where's a source for your claim?		https://t.co/T8dugYmU1R		https://t.co/QfkIYcFUHq
@NKY_Mike @alexiadaley1 @CareyKGreen @cooler2394 @RealCandaceO That's your source? Pretty much? Got something a little more concrete like some rando twitter page claiming James Earl Ray was a Dem?
@alexiadaley1 @NKY_Mike @CareyKGreen @cooler2394 @RealCandaceO I see. So all Nation of Islam members are Democrats?
@NKY_Mike @alexiadaley1 @CareyKGreen @cooler2394 @RealCandaceO "Both Malcome X and MLK Jr. were assassinated by Democrats."		I couldn't find reliable sources, let's see what you got to back up your claim. Thanks.
@FDRLST Which one of your writers is "Tomas Mendoza"? LMAO! https://t.co/ttUPuufvun
@NKY_Mike @alexiadaley1 @CareyKGreen @cooler2394 @RealCandaceO "'It was also Democrats who helped usher the bill through the House,  Senate, and ultimately a Democratic president who signed it into law,'  Enten writes.  "
@NKY_Mike @feignedidentity @CareyKGreen @cooler2394 @RealCandaceO Want me to address the context? Ok, Dr. Blasey Ford wanted to remain anonymous and not be outed, that's why Feinstein didn't bring it up in her meeting with Kavanaugh but you know this (but refuse to accept and learn it).
@NKY_Mike @feignedidentity @CareyKGreen @cooler2394 @RealCandaceO Aren't you clever.
@NKY_Mike @alexiadaley1 @CareyKGreen @cooler2394 @RealCandaceO And do a bit of research on Nixon's "Southern Strategy" if you're still not convinced.
@NKY_Mike @alexiadaley1 @CareyKGreen @cooler2394 @RealCandaceO Yeah, it's in the link I provide. Southern Democrats were bigots back then, now they're Republicans. Do I honestly need to explain to you that Democrats ≠ Progressive? 	Need an example? Think Strom Thurmond who switched to (R) after the vote.
@MonicaCrowley Hey Monica, I know you copy all your work so you prob aren't that bright but it was Rosenstein that appointed Mueller, he didn't change his mandate. He gave him his mandate. 	You're welcome.
@BCATEX @MonicaCrowley If Jeff Flake had any smarts, he would have made the FBI investigation  delay conditional on the Reps voting No on Kavanaugh, if the FBI  investigation is dirty.
@MonicaCrowley TIL that the Mueller probe had a limited time. Who'd you copy that from?
@cooler2394 @HipHopThinker @CareyKGreen @RealCandaceO Then you don't mind the investigation, right genius?
@NKY_Mike @feignedidentity @CareyKGreen @cooler2394 @RealCandaceO Yeah, you're real informed. You can't even get the names of the senators correct and you have all that info at your fingertips but I bet you criticized Ford for getting some details wrong.
@HipHopThinker @CareyKGreen @cooler2394 @RealCandaceO You know he's innocent how? Not too much of a thinker, are you!
@NKY_Mike @alexiadaley1 @CareyKGreen @cooler2394 @RealCandaceO Yup, it was those "racist democrats" that passed the 1964 Civil Rights Act and "racist democrats" that have been fighting for minority rights ever since but don't worry about facts. 		https://t.co/xz9Hm0mEoH
@cooler2394 @alexiadaley1 @CareyKGreen @RealCandaceO I see, so you think the Southerners that lynched Till were progressives and not conservatives. You must be a home skooled jenius! (sic)	No lawyer is America would take it? She had 2 lawyers at her side yesterday. You no gud at counting!
@JohnCornyn You voted against both of Obama's nominees to SC so don't cry about partisanship.
@alexiadaley1 @CareyKGreen @cooler2394 @RealCandaceO No, Conservatives lynched that boy. 		Democrats are asking for an investigation into the allegation.		My 12 year old is smart enough to understand that difference.
@psulions1982 @seanhannity For what reason exactly?
@JohnCornyn Hey Senator, I'm sure that Canada would gladly renegotiate parts of NAFTA if the US government stopped picking winners and losers and stopped subsidizing the dairy industry to the tune of billions of taxpayer dollars each and every year.
@alexiadaley1 @CareyKGreen @cooler2394 @RealCandaceO You tell me if you can spot the difference;		Democrats ask the FBI to investigate the allegations.		Conservatives lynch a 14 year old black boy based on hearsay.
@feignedidentity @CareyKGreen @cooler2394 @RealCandaceO I'm sorry, how is it not due process that the Democrats are asking the FBI to investigate the allegation?
@CareyKGreen @cooler2394 @RealCandaceO Don't you get it? Democrats asking the FBI to investigate the allegation is exactly the same thing as Conservatives lynching a 14 year old boy on the spot!		#ConservativeLogic
@RealCandaceO What kind of dope thinks that Liberals are the same as the bigots that lynched Till 60 years ago in Mississippi?
@Skywalkerplc3 @seanhannity Agreed. I too hate getting to the bottom of things and being 100% sure that serious accusations are investigated.
@RoyceSolberg @seanhannity She nailed the people that were on Kavanaugh's July 1 calendar entry. You honestly believe a guy that was treasurer of 100 keg clubs never blacked out from drinking? Sad!
@RealCandaceO You really are a dope if you think it was Liberals that were doing the lynching.
@seepat @JAngello85 @MZHemingway Great point. She wants an investigation and Kavanaugh was too cowardly to say "yes" after being asked half dozen times yesterday.
@MZHemingway Wow. That's a moronic comparison.
@KermaneB He didn't say "boffed" in his yearbook; it said "boofed". 		https://t.co/1S97eaKgKE
@dfpolitics @FoxNews And republicans are dumb enough to fall for it twice.
@demfascists @FoxNews Our money? What a dope. It was always Iran's money. All of it.
@FoxNews Must be trew if Bibi said it. Remember back in 2012 when he said Iran would have the bomb in 6 months?
@DailyCaller this guy is way too emotional to be a judge.
@FoxNews Too emotional to be a SC Justice. Sad!
@RealCandaceO Cmte vote tomorrow. How hard is it to get basic facts right?
@RealCandaceO Look at you defend the indefensible. Pathetic.
@KevinJacksonTBS Adios, Kevin! Time to change that bio.
@nickconfessore His lawyer stated that Renate was mentioned because they went to one social outing together, what made that one outing so memorable?
@AriFleischer You can't be that dense, can you? The alleged assault took place in high school. See the relevance?
@d_c59 @henryrodgersdc @DailyCaller Weak sauce.
@henryrodgersdc @DailyCaller And? Care to comment on her actual testimony?
@TheTrussel @RealCandaceO So how is that Democrats taking that away from black people?
@soitssayso @IngrahamAngle OMG!! I bet it was $1billion from (((Soros)))!!
@IngrahamAngle Care to comment on her testimony or you got nothing to refute her statements?
@PeteHegseth @realDonaldTrump Hey Pete, can I have some of what you're on? Thanks.
@TheTrussel @RealCandaceO They took away jobs then gave them back minimum wage? Care to expound?
@KimStrassel I'd wager they're less important than having Mark Judge testify but republicans aren't interested.
@SteveKingIA You mean lobbyists.
@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump And they're predicting 2% in 2019. So much winning. https://t.co/fZYEnvCIJ5
@GOPLeader How many republicans refused to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act?
@IngrahamAngle So these women aren't "true victims" of sexual assault and you know this how?
@SanjeevSaxenaMD @IngrahamAngle oopsie.		https://t.co/R3Bw8dpBGO
@SanjeevSaxenaMD @IngrahamAngle Let's see if you can provide actual evidence of who that is.
@IngrahamAngle And?
@TheTrussel @RealCandaceO What did they "take away" then "give back"?
@RealCandaceO What have conservatives done for black people?
@Retrogirl01 @joshuetree This tweet did not age well.
@AmyMoretz_ @jpodhoretz What has Avenatti been wrong about? Guy has won over $1B in judgments for his clients; he gets it done.
@jpodhoretz @SmithHemingway Clearly you can't defend your moronic "logic".
@FoxNews @kayleighmcenany @AmericaNewsroom This chick's face looks like a Picasso painting come to life.
@ProvenLeader @foxandfriends @michellemalkin I know, right? Kind of like Fox News editing out world leaders laughing at trump during his speech yesterday!
@WhiteHouse Then why is trump using taxpayer money to bail out farmers over a problem that trump created?
@greta Yeah because SCOTUS is immune from politics.
@TomiLahren Hey Tammy, when you come forward with your own sexual assault story nobody will believe you.
@ScubaS7eve @Natalia44074205 @inetsoho @seanhannity @POTUS No it's not, scuba steve. Try again.
@Natalia44074205 @inetsoho @seanhannity @POTUS Hey 44074205, explain the red (in your own words, not your GRU bosses)
@Jim_Jordan So you're saying that Rosenstein is doing the job he was hired to do?
@rendabeltzer1 @GOPLeader Only pertains to elections for federal office not for state or local elections.
@GOPLeader 10th amendment = state rights
@RepMarkMeadows Yup, all criminals should be aware of the documents investigators have, right?
@Johnnyu321 @DailyCaller @RealJamesWoods I know it's hard to read but he wasn't banned. You're welcome.
@FoxNews @POTUS Poor guy gave up his "executive time" and had to start work before his usual 11:30 start.
@RealCandaceO @FoxNews @jasoninthehouse Cons really do love their sexual deviants.
@JaySekulow Yup, giving you my email will definitely save Bibi.
@AmandaLeeHouse @SiriusXMPatriot Green cards allow legal immigrants to legally work so yeah, you should want them to have one to get off of any public benefits.
@RealCandaceO @TigerWoods Conservatives do love guys who bang porn stars behind their wives' backs.

@DrPaulGosar Paul, I'm a body language expert and I can tell that you're sad!

Flood waters still rising in NC and trump is off golfing for the weekend.	#HurricaneFlorence
@foxandfriends @JesseBWatters @edhenry I'd bring Jesse with me on The Race then leave him in the middle Africa.
@ryankidwell2012 @FoxNews "started an Investigation into Trump/Russia Collusion with that unverified, uncorroborated Russian dossier"		Source that it was the dossier that began the investigation (it didn't)?
@ryankidwell2012 @FoxNews "Signed off on an unverified, uncorroborated, FISA warrant" Just because Hannity claims this doesn't make it true. 	"suggested wearing wire to the President to invoke the 25th ammendment" from an anonymous source
@ElBuehn @ggreenwald I get it, you're a simpleton and a troll. Ciao!
@ElBuehn @ggreenwald His job is to complete said investigation and not to selectively leak bits and pieces  of information. From there he will submit his report to DAG Rosenstein  who will then act one way or the other if crimes were uncovered. 	Got it?
@ElBuehn @ggreenwald I'll make it simple for you (see if you can understand); Mueller is tasked with investigating Russia's involvement in the 2016 election and if there was any coordination with the trump campaign.
@SaraCarterDC @GreggJarrett WTF! We love anonymous sources now?
@Annakhait "Key allies" would know because we share intel with them as they do with us. They have assets at risk too. Just ask Israel what happened when trump revealed top secret intel to the Russians in the Oval Office.
@seanhannity @GreggJarrett https://t.co/WFPlbLgW1T
@RealCandaceO @TheDemocrats Amazing that you know what did or didn't happen.
@seanhannity @GreggJarrett So now we believe "anonymous sources" in the NYT?
@ElBuehn @ggreenwald Poor attempt at understanding what I'm arguing. Try again...but better.
@ggreenwald That's fantastic "logic", Glenn. Right up there with Dershowitz claiming that OOJ can't be done out in the public but must be done behind closed doors.
@DailyCaller "trump's diversity coalition" are 3 words that don't belong together.
@EdWhelanEPPC Get yourself a good lawyer.
@ryankidwell2012 @FoxNews How is Rosenstein "obstructing"?
@Richey4Fun @FoxNews It's funny that you think that the executive branch is the boss of the legislative. 	Actually, it's sad. Want to borrow my 12 year old's  civics book?
@Jim_Hardie1 @Gimpmaker @FoxNews @Cernovich Hmmm, I should have known I was dealing with low information trolls that don't even bother reading articles that they commented on. 		Carry on talking about the Clintons and supporting rapist Donny.
@DRUDGE_REPORT don't these bums have jerbs?
@ddale8 It's been a couple weeks since his last round. He must be going through withdrawals.
@Jim_Hardie1 @Gimpmaker @FoxNews @Cernovich I'm sorry, where did I say I supported the Clintons? I just think you're a complete dope trying to change the subject away from RW hero Cody Wilson being a stat rapist
@WHPublicPool Golfing while Carolinians' lives are in ruins. Sad!
@Jim_Hardie1 @FoxNews @Cernovich And trump was Epstein's buddy. Google it. But still nothing to do with RW hero Cody Wilson being busted for stat. rape.
@Jim_Hardie1 @Gimpmaker @FoxNews @Cernovich Time for your pills.
@Gimpmaker @Jim_Hardie1 @FoxNews @Cernovich What would you dopes do without the Clintons?
@Jim_Hardie1 @Gimpmaker @FoxNews @Cernovich Fact. RW hero Cody Wilson was just arrested for stat rape. Zero to do with Clinton. See?
@Jim_Hardie1 @Gimpmaker @FoxNews @Cernovich RWNJs are incapable of staying on point. Topic is Wilson being arrested for stat rape. Got it?
@Gimpmaker @Jim_Hardie1 @FoxNews @Cernovich I'm sure he was arrested because of the deep state and fled the country for no reason, right?
@Jim_Hardie1 @Gimpmaker @FoxNews @Cernovich trump partook in those flights too!
@Gimpmaker @Jim_Hardie1 @FoxNews @Cernovich trump repeatedly raped a 14 year old with his buddy Epstein.
@Jim_Hardie1 @FoxNews @Cernovich Which minor did Clinton pay for sex?
@UtsavSanduja @FoxNews Look at you defend a pedo!
@SaraCarterDC @realDonaldTrump WTF, now we love anonymous sources!
@Tarasa52965489 @DailyCaller Hey 52965489, do you think trump should read them first?
@jordanbpeterson Claims to be an intellectual, doesn't know the definition of "treasonous".
@RealCandaceO Reminder that taxpayer money went into your pocket because you claimed someone said mean words to you. #Hypocrite
@TonyZeta @JaySekulow you mean something similar to pre-1953 when the US and UK removed the democratically elected gov't and installed a dictator?
@JaySekulow Yes, me giving you my email so you can try to squeeze me for money will definitely stop Iran.
@Miss_DeMeanor2 @FoxNews @POTUS Sleeping through BENGHAZI!!1!  You've got a legit source for that BS, right? 	trump is still going golfing though so I'm assuming you're just as outraged, right?
@FoxNews @POTUS Millions suffering in the Carolinas and trump out campaigning then heading to NJ for some golf. Remember when you RWNJs attacked Obama for doing much less?
@SaysSimonson @peterjhasson @AndrewKerrNC Now you guys want the IRS to go after political enemies. Nice
@wuxeter @BreitbartNews Look at you being all commie and wanting regulations.
@TuckerCarlson TC pushes propaganda to millions every night, where's your outrage, TC?
@SaraCarterDC Only complete dopes continue to give credence to any O'keefe video.
@SirRake @henryrodgersdc @DailyCaller @ChuckGrassley I assume you'll have the same criticism for people waiting in line for yet another trump rally tonight in Vegas, right?
@redsteeze Pointing out a fact is "transparent"? Unless he's impeached and convicted by Congress he'll remain on the DC circuit, if he isn't confirmed for SCOTUS. That's a fact.
@MikeAnthony654 @SaraCarterDC Make sure to apply that to trump when he refuses to sit for the Mueller interview.
@SueleeMel @SaraCarterDC Because?
@energypassage @SaraCarterDC Please name one crime that Ohr committed. Thanks.
Millions still suffering in the Carolinas and trump is going golfing for the weekend.		https://t.co/Guk1JPBbCX
@WHPublicPool People are suffering in the Carolinas and trump is heading to yet another rally. Pathetic.
@FoxNews @DevinNunes @POTUS Maybe trump should read them (or have an adult explain them to him) before declassifying the documents.
@JaySekulow How does me giving you my email save Pakistani Christians? You plan on grifting for donations that will go in your pocket?
@TomFoolery2u @TomFitton @JudicialWatch trump has already taken 17 trips to Florida and 16 to NJ in less than 20 months. Please don't be an idiot and suggest that he pays for the trips.
@CuomoPrimeTime @JaySekulow @ChrisCuomo DOJ rules required the recusal because Sessions was a campaign advisor. Where'd this dope go to law school?
@RealCandaceO Aren't you clever.
@SaraCarterDC @seanhannity @GreggJarrett Sara, what are your thought on trump not even having read the pages he wants declassified? Laziest potus ever.
@DDRode @seanhannity The way of the swamp? trump hand picked him. In case you don't know this; the AG's job isn't to be trump's personal lawyer and to protect him.
@bbillsfan01 @seanhannity AG's job isn't to protect the president like the crybaby in chief thinks.
@RichardPCurran6 @seanhannity Holy crap is your English garbage. Fix your translation software.
@Boiler1Josh @BreitbartNews Obama cheated on multiple wives and with a porn star? Sources?
@TheRealPatriotG @BreitbartNews You do realize that the reason they're doing so is because trump had sex with said pornstar mere weeks after the birth of his 5th (?) child by his 3rd wife; all of whom he cheated on, right?
@ByronTau it should be automatically assumed that trump doesn't read anything put in front of him. Ever!
@kilmeade @TomiLahren @foxandfriends You guys didn't mind doing it to Bill Clinton, right?
@NRO Third World? What year is it?
@WilliamJBennett Steve Wynn? Boy, you moral crusaders really can pick them.
@WilliamJBennett @realDonaldTrump Hey Bill, remember when you used to care about moral leaders? Guess you just a partisan hack trying to make a buck.
@WilliamJBennett @realDonaldTrump This tweet aged like fine milk.
@FoxNews @POTUS Dictator trump thinks that the AG is there to protect his YUGE ass.
@TomFitton Republicans love their rapists.
@TomFitton @FBI @atensnut @JudicialWatch Why, is he being appointed to SCOTUS?
@DailyCaller Christians aren't supposed to lie.		Sanders lies with ease. 		Sanders is no Christian.
@TomFitton Seditious? I don't think you know what that word means.
@FoxNews @POTUS Standing in water pretending to be presidential.
@nedryun I bet your stock portfolio says differently.
@Jenapher_B @realDonaldTrump Sure he did. then why did trump abandon his mentor Roy Cohn when he was dying of AIDS?
@realDonaldTrump Kind of like when you blamed Obama for the lack of fuel and electricity after Sandy hit NY/NJ. 		I'm assuming everyone in NC has both by now, right?
@dad4life10 @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump @JudicialWatch Yeah, I look up a RW conspiracy theory first thing. Let's see if you can provide a legit source for this claim; I'll accept Fox News, surely they covered this bombshell, right?
@JohnCornyn Career total; "Oil &amp; Gas" is  your #1 donor. 		https://t.co/4XEFQ4HQS7
@JohnCornyn You do love your "Oil &amp; Gas" campaign dollars.		https://t.co/PU0YxGF7W6
@dad4life10 @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump @JudicialWatch That seems like a reliable site.
@seanhannity @Project_Veritas Only dopes believe O'keefe videos.
@TomFitton Where's your lawsuit demanding trump release his tax returns? Where's your lawsuit demanding the cost of trump's frequent personal trips to his properties?
@FoxNews @DevinNunes @POTUS @IngrahamAngle Then why not declassify the entire document and not just a selected few pages?
@JaySekulow FYI: anti-Zionists ≠ anti-Semitic  		and what about "muh free speech?"
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump @JudicialWatch Then why not declassify the entire document instead of a few selected pages?
@seanhannity this will surely be it, right?
@joecmcconnell @FoxNews sent from your "Made in China" computer.

@SaraCarterDC Ooh, this is the time you get him with your wild conspiracy theory (last time blew up in your face when all the texts were released instead of a selected few).

@TomFitton @JudicialWatch Have you guys requested info on trump's travel expenses yet or are you partisan hacks?
@RealCandaceO Hey Candace, remember when you  accused and sued a city of racism? the internet does.
@RealCandaceO Yeah, except for the 2012 revelation.	Republicans will rally around all their scumbags.
@TomFitton Republicans really do love their sexual assailants.
@BeautyBind Are you just finding this out 2 years later? He's out this year anyways.
@WHPublicPool trump is DC's first Hurricane Florence casualty; poor guy can't even go golfing. I'm sure Kelly hid his clubs.
@FoxNews @MariaBartiromo trump's fault these people don't have electricity.
@IngrahamAngle Strange that you never posted a story about the  Las Vegas or Stoneman Douglas massacres. Agenda much?
@jjrrobb2 @IngrahamAngle Want to bet they legally purchased the weapons in the US?

@meheathcoe @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Wasted money? Mueller made a profit on his investigation. Keep up!
@JLfc86 @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump So you read the entire batch of recent texts or just the two that were selectively leaked by Meadows and Jordan?
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump yeah, that's why they appointed him, to investigate the crime. Damn, you RWs are dumb.
@KellyO Wow, trump is a victim of Florence too. Poor guy can't even go grift at his own golf course. I'm sure Kelly told the USSS not to let him leave and trump is throwing a hissy fit
@LeggeroG @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @JudicialWatch The economy has been getting better since 2010. I'm willing to bet that you don't know what the unemployment rate was when Obama took office and when he left yet somehow trump is trying claim credit.
@JaySekulow @ACLJ Your #1 client is FUCKED!
@LeggeroG @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @JudicialWatch trump can thank Obama for the economy. trump promised to hire "the best people" clearly that was yet another lie. Great that you won't engage in name calling maybe ditch the whackadoodle conspiracy theories too.
@LeggeroG @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @JudicialWatch So what you're saying is that trump is an absolute moron and incapable of vetting his own people? Thanks for seeing the light.
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @JudicialWatch Aren't  you supposed to be non-partisan? You honestly think trump's hand picked appointees are part of the deep state?
@MaxMcGloin @maggieNYT Even though it is an island surrounded by water, big water, ocean water?

@Sonomon12 @to_dump @WillHouston11 @FoxNews Stop your virtue signaling and get upset about something that matters like a cop killing a man in his own home then defaming him afterwards.
@SaraCarterDC Have you updated your Page/ Strzok text "scoop" yet? Great "investigative" reporting.
@TuckerCarlson Let's see if you let him answer questions without interruption
@FoxNews Why hasn't the most patriotic president of all time rushed out to save the flag?
@TravisJ1973 @FoxNews I see but didn't trump repeatedly brag that Mejíco was going to pay for the wall so why would Congress authorize funds?
@TravisJ1973 @FoxNews Why should Dems and half republicans vote to fund the wall when trump repeatedly boasted that Mexico would pay for it?
@FoxNews trump is weak on the border. He promised that Mexico would pay for a big, beautiful wall. Sad!
@Jim_Jordan When did the IRS target conservatives?
@BillyFletch @TuckerCarlson What's your hashtag for the guy that was banging her shortly after his wife gave birth to his 5th (?) child?
@travispjohnson @RBPundit It's still summer. When exactly did she get it?
@travispjohnson @RBPundit Probably because she was just contacted by the woman's attorney.
@RBPundit Nice strawman. No one said that high schoolers don't have sex. However, if there was criminal activity then that's the issue, dumbass.
@PazuzuJSmith @crbrendemuehl @RBPundit You forgot trump!
@sassysn0wflake @Jim_Jordan Don't forget about the billions on tanks that the Pentagon doesn't want.		https://t.co/nrc3CB1R2M
@MWBRI @crbrendemuehl @RBPundit But the Clintons! But the Clintons! But the Clintons! But the Clintons! But the Clintons! But the Clintons! But the Clintons! But the Clintons! But the Clintons! But the Clintons! But the Clintons! But the Clintons! But the Clintons! But the Clintons! But the Clintons!
@crbrendemuehl @RBPundit No, at worst he was a sexual predator not "a bit of a pig" but you republicans do love your sexual predators. #MAGA
@RBPundit That's not the rumor. The rumor is that he bought "baseball tickets" with his credit card as a way to pay hush money to the victim.
@SaraCarterDC Hey Sara, you should get in on the scoop unless you're too busy inventing FBI text message conspiracy theories.
@FoxNews Hey trump supporters, Florence is  #FakeNews, just stay put in your homes. El Rushbo says so.
Reminder that these Republicans voted against Sandy relief (but will come begging for money for their states when Hurricane Florence hits):		@TGowdySC 	@RepJeffDuncan 	@virginiafoxx 	@TomGravesGA14 	@RepRichHudson 	@RepJoeWilson		#HurricaneFlorence2018
@AntiWhiteNews @FoxNews Well this chart seems legit since it's got numbers and bars and everything. Who needs sources though.
@IngrahamAngle @Shareaholic What would you guys do without the Clintons? HH!
@WHPublicPool Busy busy day tomorrow! Lots of tweets forthcoming.
@seanhannity @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows OOOOhh! I bet THIS is the time your conspiracy theory comes true!

@FoxNews @POTUS @WhiteHouse GEOTUS is braver than all those Medal recipients. The Viet Cong is lucky he was suffering bone spurs or he would have run into the jungle (unarmed of course) and killed them all.
@TheeAndroidRulz @GOPLeader "And as such they have no need or right to censor and ban content."		sources needed. Thanks. 		Clearly you need to take a Civics 101 class.
@GOPLeader It's none of Congress's business how Google runs it's platform.
@FoxNews Look at all the butthurt snowflakes and their virtue signaling. Sad!
@WillHouston11 @FoxNews Pretty sure that Apollo 11 will be in the movie.
@GOPLeader @POTUS Hey Kevin, thanks for the $1T deficit this year. Is that the Dems fault too?
https://t.co/KpYCjpWMrO
@chuckvant58 @FoxNews Nah, Obama's FEMA did its job unlike trump's. Took a fucking year to get the lights back on in PR with trump bragging and giving himself an A+ the entire time.
@Jon96217309 @IngrahamAngle @theadvocateno Timothy Jackson is serving a life sentence in Louisiana, know what his crime was? Shoplifting (non-violent) a $160 jacket. It was his 4th conviction, all  non-violent, you think the punishment fits the crime?
@FoxNews Hey trump supporters, the storm is FAKE NEWS!! don't worry about it, just stay put and enjoy the beach.
@Forthright_J @SaraCarterDC For what exactly?
@FoxNews If trump is as innocent as he claims then he should want Mueller to finish the investigation. Sad!
It's 2018 and Hannity is still talking about #Benghazi!
@kimba060764 @RepMarkMeadows https://t.co/NnfcAtZ8aU
@KenRowland77 @RepMarkMeadows Yeah, shame on me for demanding actual, verifiable proof when  an elected rep makes an unfounded claim based on selective, out of context tweets. My bad!
@RepMarkMeadows Can you name just one story he leaked? If he really wanted to stop trump like you keep inventing, he would have leaked that trump was under investigation before the election. Didn't happen, did it?
@ArianKillebrew @FoxNews You care so much about BENGHAZI!!! but you can't even get the date right. Sad!
@Senpai_Keith @FoxNews Yes. trump's fault!
@AriFleischer I can't wait for you to get to the part where we invade Iraq on false intel, completely destabilizing the region leading to the formation of ISIS!
@Senpai_Keith @FoxNews I'm just following "conservative logic"; every time a cop was shot and killed during Obama's presidency RWNJs blamed Obama so I'm assuming the same applies to trump, right?
@FoxNews trump's fault.
@GeorgePapa19 GP: "It's Clinton's fault I committed light treason!"
@JudicialWatch @TomFitton A trump appointed official is the "deep state"? Talk about the derp state!
@FoxNews @AdamKlotzFNC How many paper towel rolls will trump toss to the plebs?
@realDonaldTrump Warm up your arm for the paper towel throwing!
@FoxNews I'm so excited to watch GEOTUS throw paper towels to the plebs!
@GoBuckeyesOH @Jim_Jordan @BarackObama He was in the Oval Office, dope.	I suppose that you're equally outraged that trump did nothing to help save the four Green Berets that were killed in Niger, right?
@FoxNews @PressSec @POTUS Kim wants another US taxpayer funded vacation and trump will oblige.
@JohnCornyn he thinks that the president is above the law, how is that "pro-constitution"?
@jeffzeleny And here I thought they'd be briefing people about the Hurricane and not about trump's electoral college victory. Sad!
@TomFitton @NFL How many of you RWNJs are outraged that the flag in Tom's link is being displayed improperly? Quit your virtue signaling.
@sbh1cats @foxandfriends I know you're a con but do you not realize that the NYT knows the identity of the author?
@donnahartt @seanhannity You shouldn't have dropped out of 3rd grade.
@ClaudiuIonutes1 @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump You must be pissed off that trump was ogling college cheerleaders instead of joining his guests to respect the National Anthem, right?
I have no idea where trump finds the time to binge Fox News and rage tweet every day! Laziest POTUS ever.		https://t.co/TohExfGJEy https://t.co/y364q3Vv8r
@ChrisCuomo Christian college doesn't care about systematic racism. Shocking!
@exit15w @EnterprisesFart @DailyCaller What are your thoughts on Nate Boyer telling Kaep to kneel? Stop your virtue signaling!
@FoxNews Imagine being more upset about a Nike commercial than systematic police abuse of minorities.
@JacksJeanine @FoxNews Let me know when the Clinton's foundation is under criminal investigation for abusing donations like trump's did.
@FoxNews Sounds like they'd be great at running trump's "charitable" foundation.
@Sheasy64 @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump You're great at regurgitating talking points but garbage at actual facts when challenged. Hey Tony, Mueller comin'!		https://t.co/HZSR01raoN
@Sheasy64 @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Nothing is Simpson's testimony points to him contacting Rob Goldstone to arrange the meeting with trump's campaign manager but you clearly have evidence I'm not privy to, so please share.
@Sheasy64 @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Yeah, Jr. is a reliable narrator. A guy that lied about the meeting for over a year, claiming they NEVER met with Russians suddenly recalls a meeting about adoptions. You're incredibly naive if you think that was the end of it.
@Sheasy64 @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump I see. following  your "logic" since he "knew" her that means he directed her to meet with trump's brain trust at trump Tower, right? Is that really the leap in logic you're attempting to make?
@Sheasy64 @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Source that she was a client? Again, how did Simpson get Rob Goldstone to arrange the meeting with trump's top campaign staff?
@Sheasy64 @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump excellent retort. Feel free to copy/ paste the relevant parts of his testimony. In the meantime, who forced Rob Goldstone to arrange the meeting? (Simpson testified he didn't know him, never worked with him)
@Sheasy64 @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump I have. Please point out where in the testimony he admitted to arranging the meeting between the Kremlin lawyer and trump's top campaign team?
@Sheasy64 @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump I see you don't plan on answering the question. Tell me, what did Fusion GPS and Glen Simpson have to do with Rob Goldstone arranging the meet between Jr and the Russians?
@Sheasy64 @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Are you saying that Fusion GPS and the DNC jedi mind tricked Jr, Manafort, and Kush into meeting with Russians in trump tower? Let Q know you're onto something.
@charliekirk11 Maybe you should read the constitution before you claim something is unconstitutional:		"Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according  to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in  each State, excluding Indians not taxed"
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Who paid the Russians to meet with Jr, Manafort, and Kushner at trump Tower?
@sgtbetsysmith @IngrahamAngle In the last 100+ years Chicago has had a grand total of 6 years with a black mayor, nothing in the last 35 years. Your entire post was bullshit.
@sgtbetsysmith @IngrahamAngle https://t.co/nsOEnTJRGv
@sgtbetsysmith @IngrahamAngle It got worse? Actually, fewer people were shot and killed in Chicago during Obama's 8 years than during W's 8.

@leighawaterfall @VooduChild @FoxNews In what world is a random picture with ZERO context "evidence"?
@VooduChild @FoxNews There is literally zero evidence to support this garbage. Delete this post.
@lcrain82 @ChuckRossDC @DailyCaller He did? Give me your source because everything I saw said he didn't but I fact check. 	https://t.co/zixbQWBbVY https://t.co/2lGcMZjxwI
@lcrain82 @ChuckRossDC @DailyCaller what's this have to do with Mueller?
@joncoopertweets Leave him alone. He's prepping for the pending hurricane by working on his putting.
@WHPublicPool Prepping for the Hurricane on the course. Sad!
@FoxNews Bunch of virtue signalers. Sad!
@foxandfriends @JedediahBila @edhenry Ed should stay away from women that aren't his wife.
@SusieQ_Elayne @FoxNews Yup. This POS is a trump supporter. Sad!
@ChrisCuomo Stop interviewing anyone that has ever signed a non-disparage NDA with the trump campaign.
@seanhannity Glad to see that a Christian college doesn't support protests against police abuse but do support a serial philanderer. Jesus would be so so proud.
@seanhannity Neither you nor John Solomon know the inner workings of the Mueller probe.
@JkgaddisJulie @BarackObama Nearly destroyed it? Agreed! Where in the hell was 0bummer during Katrina, 9/11, 2008's global recession, etc...? I demand 10 Congressional investigation into Obama lying about WMDs in Iraq!!!
@RepMarkMeadows Because republicans prefer babbling morons to intelligent leaders?
@thehill Why did Dershowitz defend a wife murderer?
@SManolesco @realDonaldTrump Now you can spend that cash on more botox.
@elouai @chicksonright "Normal businesses would fire employees who attempt to get others fired or deplatformed."		Source needed.
@speculawyer @FoxNews @POTUS I'm anxiously awaiting the 2018 results.

@b_wildt @LauraLoomer @chuckwoolery @Twitter @jack @CNN @DonaldJTrumpJr @foxandfriends @PrisonPlanet @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @RealCandaceO @michellemalkin @kimguilfoyle @JamesOKeefeIII You need a history lesson.
@SumlinGary @foxandfriends @SaraCarterDC 100% agree....once we get the pesos upfront.
@alphabaker7 @dbongino Thank you for admitting your mistake.
@alphabaker7 @dbongino What rule of law was broken?
@dbongino Why do you hate transparency?
@FoxNews @SteveScalise @CoryBooker Republicans hate transparency.
@ddale8 Is his campaign paying 100% of the costs?
@FoxNews @GOPLeader @IngrahamAngle Anyone else remember when McCarthy said that Putin pays trump? That's how we know we're family.
