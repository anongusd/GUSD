While there is much that is needed and that Republicans have long sought in this legislation, it is my firm desire that we never again face this cycle of short-term funding resolutions followed by a single, all-encompassing bill.
This relief will do more than simply get our fellow citizens back on their feet. It will lay the foundation for communities to become far more resilient against future disasters.
This legislation also includes disaster relief for California, Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.
Our military will now have full funding at the levels our men and women in uniform need to defend our country, update necessary equipment, and ensure that we are stronger than every other country in the world.
