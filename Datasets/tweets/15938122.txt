Romney at CPAC calls himself "a severely conservative Republican governor." Huh?
@RoyBlunt calls Obama contraception fix "accounting gimmick." Not "about cost–about who controls the relig views of faith-based institutions
Obama refers to "genuine concerns" about HHS rule but also "the more cynical desire on the part of some to make this a political football."
Santorum at CPAC: "I am not asking for your fortune, but if you go to http://t.co/ZRgG0VAf, a piece of that fortune would be very helpful."
Under "compromise," religious institutions won't have to pay for contraception, either. But insurance companies will, WH officials say.
White House officials telling us Obama will say relig institutions WON'T have to cover contraception; will be done by insurance cos instead.
Mitt & McCaskill hangin' out, or what? Romney calls for a permanent ban on earmarks, a step to "restoring fiscal sanity in Washington.”

In fiery end, Obama says he's taking plan to the streets "to every corner of the country." Does he have the juice just now to back that up?
"Act as one nation and one people." Isn't that straight out of a Black-Eyed Peas tune?
"Already we're seeing the same old press releases and tweets flying back and forth." A nod to Twitter even if tweets same and old?
What I'm hearing near the end is a spirited defense of an activist government. Is this a message in tune with the times?
Of course every good presidential speech needs a passage or two featuring Abraham Lincoln -- a REPUBLICAN president, he observes.
Obama baiting GOP with talk about all those dastardly government rules and regs. Whoops, says he won't wipe out basic protections.

Thought I heard Obama say: "This is simple meth" but it was "simple math." (Boehner looks like he could use a boost.)
Yes, the opening speech in Obama's re-election campaign, which is why he is flopping out these tax-the-rich red meat morsels for the base.
Obama delivers clean shot at "sworn oaths to never raise any taxes on anyone for as long as you live." So extend payroll tax, folks.
"No more earmarks. No more boondoggles. No more bridges to nowhere." Chorus in Obama's new country-western tune?
Obama says his plan will fix up at least 35k schools. Even budget hawks thinking: how many in my state/district?
This is not hope-in-the-sky soaring rhetoric but a meat-and-potatoes speech Obama bringin largely in simple, declarative sentences.
How big of a sales job does this president have tonight? In new WashPost-ABC News poll, 60 percent disapprove of his handling economy.
Obama speech has refrain of "pass this right away." Like rock & roll, the power in political speech comes from repetition.
