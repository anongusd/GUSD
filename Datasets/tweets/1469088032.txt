5) Russia has become convinced that US sanctions policy is no longer connected to its behavior (ie that it's a product of US domestic politics &amp; they'll hit us no matter what), thus weakening the incentive for Russia to change its behavior
4) Sanctions only as good as policy they're advancing. In US now, seems to add up to Russia ‚â† bad. Congress/WH/Bureacracy have separate policies. Initial strategic goals (changing Russia's behavior in Ukr &amp; elsewhere) have taken backseat to punitive desire to 'hit the Russians'
3) The US &amp; Europe are out of sync on Russia sanctions. Under the Obama admin, much effort made to keep respective policies close. Under Trump, for obvious reasons, less coordination with purported allies. This generates frustration &amp; pushes European biz to find ways to hedge
2) At the same time, sanctions have remarkable power. Having the US govt dictate the ownership structure of major Russian assets is of no comfort to the Kremlin. (Though of course subject to the efficacy of enforcement by Treasury.)
1) Russia ‚â† Iran, North Korea, Venezuela. Russia's integration into the global economy limits the efficacy of sanctions as a US policy tool. Hard to hit significant Russian assets without a boomerang effect. To wit, measures against Deripaska threatened *75,000* jobs in the EU

@ThomasAdshead Didn‚Äôt want to get into the rumor mill in the piece too much. I‚Äôm inclined to think they‚Äôll keep Medvedev around unless things get *much* worse. But either way, Sobyanin plays a crucial role in the coming political cycle &amp; figured most readers won‚Äôt know much about him!
@ThomasAdshead Yep. Came on the radar after successful stint as mayor of Kogalym (one of key Lukoil cities); linked up w Fillipenko (then head of K-Mansisk) in 90s, which led to stints in SovFed&amp;Kremlin. Then ran&amp;won a relatively competitive race for gov of Tyumen in 2001
4/It seems to me that these basic qualities‚Äîorganizational/managerial ability, responsibility, and obedience‚Äîgo a long way to explaining Sobyanin's later rise in the Russian system. (As opposed to, say, personal ties to Putin, sec service background, or wonky economic knowledge.)
3/Alexei Yurchak writes abt komsorgs in his brilliant 'Everything was Forever Until it was No More': Komsorgs "enjoyed organizing people&amp;orchestrating social activities, they were seen by teachers&amp;peers as responsible people, or they simply were unlikely to turn down requests.‚Äù
2/ I tracked down his high-school chemistry teacher from that time, Nadezhda Vakhrina, who recalled him fondly: ‚ÄúSergei was an authoritative comrade... Only the most responsible and conscientious were made komsorg.‚Äù
P.S. One of my favorite bits from reporting this (which, alas, got cut in the print version) was learning that Sobyanin‚Äôs first leadership experience came in his village schoolhouse, when he was made komsorg, or organizer of the communist party youth group, in the 10th grade https://t.co/IjyUFKlxYi

5/Yet these days Rostov defines itself thru culture. Art,theatre&amp;most of all food, thanks to local restaurateurs like @KalinichVadim who look to river&amp;nearby farmers for ingredients&amp;inspiration. For a taste, see this great city guide from @calvertjournal https://t.co/KBeBDUQ5Dc
