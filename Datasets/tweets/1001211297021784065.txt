@acdiii70 @FoxNewsInsider @TomFitton @OutnumberedOT @HARRISFAULKNER @JudicialWatch Tend to disagree as Tom Fitton has uncovered facts. I don't think all of his work will go unnoticed or in vain it's just taking so darn long. Let's face it there are cover-ups going on from this prior Administration and that's no BS.

@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump @JudicialWatch This is so true Tom. Thank you for all you do. We have to stand together and educate all Americans of these truths. We can't go backwards!
@FoxBusiness @SebGorka Can't help but thinking this is just a hoax to distract POTUS sent by one of  far too many people I suspect to even begin naming who would fit the bill into stooping that low.

@senorrinhatch @DeplorableJon Wouldn't you say that's unethical Behavior not becoming of a senator?
@AnnaApp91838450 @ThomMAGA So in her attempt to discredit Judge Kavanaugh with this Law Firm person questioning did she ever come out with the truth? Lies in a failed attempt to create false suspicions.. two peas in a pod😬😬
@CoryBooker Oh great ...so these are on top of the ones that were already available to Mr. Booker before he lied un- ethically in his Spartacus moment indicating he did not have privy to!😁🇺🇸🙏
@JudicialWatch @FoxNews I don't know about anyone else but the fact it appeared in the New York Times does anyone else speculate that it might be an " Inside Job"?
So true and the smug queen of Lies puts out a book. Reverse psychology... we could see right through it! https://t.co/cgnwDFxNuv
@SaraCarterDC Did we ever find out what the big mystery lawyer Harris was accusing the Judge of supposedly knowing? Curious if this was just a curve ball she threw to try to discredit him and creates suspicion?
@BobHugin @SenatorMenendez This Foreign Relations Committee that he's on.. exactly is it a another no show job?
@BobHugin @SenatorMenendez It's evident, New Jersey needs a change. Regarding Booker, I hope as Mitch McDonald stated his Behavior should be looked at by the Ethics Committee. Don't use someone's nomination deliberations as a theatrical stage to perform your antics.
