After getting called out CNN, finally includes John Fry’s name in its story about a corrupt IRS agent who illegally leaked Michael Cohen’s bank records to Michael Avenatti and Ronan Farrow. Bizarre. https://t.co/rNOmUxzbuh
@KaraScannell @RonanFarrow In reality, the records had been restricted to prevent lawless bureaucrats like John Fry from illegally accessing and leaking confidential records to propagandists like Avenatti and Farrow.
@KaraScannell Per an affidavit from the Treasury Inspector General, Fry illegally leaked Cohen’s records to both Avenatti and @RonanFarrow, who used the leaks as the basis for error-ridden and inaccurate article claiming that Cohen’s bank records were “missing” from a government database. https://t.co/habnoDWQY0

The law that delegates authority to the president pursuant to an emergency declaration also allows Congress to rescind that authority and terminate the president’s emergency declaration. The current process is being used exactly as it was designed. https://t.co/ysW54evXzg
The amount of gaslighting from people who are pretending to oppose border security on process when they actually oppose border security on principle (but don’t want to admit it) is a sight to behold. Since 2001, POTUS has used emergency declarations for appropriations *18 times.*

You mean other than the fact that military troops are already down there constructing it? https://t.co/4O1XL8XBej
It's a gray area b/c the underlying National Emergencies Act statute (and the myriad laws dealing with emergency declarations) doesn't define what constitutes an emergency. But that is up to Congress, not POTUS, to remedy via statute. https://t.co/91rrKHjwzu
There are fair *political* arguments to make against the president using a declaration of emergency to fund border fence construction, but the *legal/constitutional* arguments against it are baseless. POTUS has the authority to do this because Congress repeatedly gave it to him.
Congress gave the president authority to declare emergencies via the National Emergencies Act of 1976. Congress authorized the construction of a border fence via the Secure Fence Act of 2006. And it appropriated funding for military construction projects via Public Law 115-244.
There's nothing lawless about the president using an emergency declaration to make available already appropriated funding for military construction of a border fence. The fence, emergency declaration, and appropriations transfer authority all derive from existing laws.

Definitely need independent corroboration, especially given all the hoaxes/deceptively edited gotcha stories of late. And if it’s a hoax, the sooner it’s exposed, the better. https://t.co/5zzJWek5fZ
Has @GovernorVA issued a comment/explanation for this? Is it an authentic photo that appeared in his yearbook? Did he submit it for publication? Is he pictured in the photo, and, if so, is he in blackface or the KKK outfit? Or is this all a hoax? He needs to explain.
Yearbook photos appear to show Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam posing in a blackface photo. It’s hard to tell whether he’s the one in blackface, or the one wearing a KKK outfit. Between this and his pro-infanticide push, Margaret Sanger would be proud. https://t.co/E8Ak5zvPR8
