Rep.-elect Max Rose also headed into Pelosi’s office now. He’s among the 17 current and incoming members who say they won’t for Pelosi.
Rep. Cummings brokered the meeting happening now between Leader Pelosi and Rep. Fudge.
Friday morning. Marcia Fudge still pondering a Speaker bid. Doesn’t seem in a hurry — she suggested she’ll decide by the floor vote on 1/3, not the caucus vote on 11/28.
Correct me if I’m wrong, Twitter, but I believe this is the first endorsement Pelosi’s office house touted from incoming freshman. This one from fellow Californians Katie Hill and Mike Levin —&gt; https://t.co/lynTUUE2Jy

McCarthy blames historical trends, not Trump, for GOP loss of majority. “We know we have our work cut out for us, we know we have our work cut out for us, we know that we have challenges in suburban areas.”
McCarthy also thanks Jim Jordan for running, notes that they came into Congress together in one of the smallest classes in recent history
Rep. Smith, in GOP leadership post-election presser, notes average age of republican leaders is 52 compared to 78 among top 3 democratic leaders.
McCarthy says top two goals are to unite Americans, and win back majority. Then says Democrats “want to disrupt, they want to try to impeach.”

Rep. Moulton says he is positive the anti-Pelosi faction has the votes to stop her from becoming speaker, and they hope to release a letter before the caucus vote later this month to prove it. Meanwhile, Pelosi backers sound equally confident she will have the votes to win.
In a show of strength ahead of Democratic leadership elections later this month, Whip Hoyer releases a letter with 155 signatories promising to back him as Majority Leader. That may offer a window into why Clyburn decided not to challenge him for the #2 spot.

The rules change just passed by voice vote. In a dramatic shift, Fowler dropped his demands for a series of votes at the last minute and allowed a vote by acclimation.
@davealvord164 Sorry about the late response -- it's being aired on CSPAN!
But former DNC Chairman Don Fowler, an opponent of the changes, told members the new system will disenfranchise people who are African American, Latino, LGBT and have physical or other disabilities by taking away their voice on the first ballot.
The push for reform was born out of complaints by Bernie Sanders supporters that superdelegates unfairly handed Clinton the nomination in 2016. DNC Chairman Perez called reforms "a clear statement to people who share our values that we trust you &amp; we are going to earn your trust"
The DNC is meeting this morning in Chicago to vote on (among other things) changes to the nominating process. Proposed change on the table would bar superdelegates from voting on the first ballot at the convention unless they have enough pledged delegates.

And the House is done and headed home for a weeklong July 4 recess. Things that didn't get done before they left: passing legislation to end family separation at the border.
The House just voted 226 to 183 on party lines to approve a nonbinding resolution to demand that the Justice Department fully comply with all document requests from the House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees by July 6.

It is very unlikely that the House will take up a narrow bill dealing with family separation before they leave tomorrow afternoon for a weeklong recess. They are still working with the White House to figure out what exactly the president would sign. That is not clear right now.
As expected, the bill failed — by a big margin of 121 yes to 301 no. So much for that last-minute tweet. https://t.co/YakCa7YoEJ
House voting now on the immigration bill negotiated by moderates and conservatives. Includes fix to keep families together by allowing children to remain in DHS custody for &gt;20 days and mandating that their parents be held in DHS custody rather than DOJ custody if prosecuted.
Hoyer also says he does not believe Crowley should step down from his position early.
Hoyer says he is sorry about Crowley’s loss, but days Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had “one of the most powerful ads I’ve seen” and ran a very effective campaign.

Rep. Walker says that he believes the  House will vote on the compromise bill tomorrow without the ag and e-verify provisions. Adding them in got some conservatives, but raised concerns among moderates. So the bill’s failure tomorrow is still all but certain.
In fact, almost every day President Trump says something that makes this country more dangerous for people who look like Congresswoman Waters and other minorities. Where is the national conversation on civility in these moments?"
“We cannot forget that President Trump, as a candidate, encouraged his supporters to beat up his detractors at rallies, and, as president, morally equated white supremacists with anti-racist activists and encouraged police officers to beat up suspects...
by letting President Trump and members of his Administration know that separating young immigrant children from their parents is not who we are as a country."

The SUPPPORT for Patients and Communties Act (HR 6) passed by a vote of 396-14. There were some Democratic concerns about the opioid bills not doing enough to address the crisis, especially with GOP dismantling of Obamacare, but not enough to stop a big bipartisan vote.
@ECUConn “Let that be a lesson to us all: There is no event so joyful, no place so safe, that it is untouched by the drug crisis. Even a wedding chapel. Even here, in the halls of power. Even in my office," McCarthy said.
@ECUConn In 2012, Eamon got addicted to opioid painkillers after he hurt his back at work. He eventually switched to heroin when the pills got too expensive. He died after overdosing on June 8, 2016. It was just 24 days before Erin's wedding.
Leader McCarthy spoke about the crisis this morning where he talked about just how close to home this crisis hits, even for members in Washington. He paid tribute to Eamon Eric Callanan, the brother of his spokeswoman, @ECUConn
Nearly all of the bills were bipartisan. They aim to study the crisis and treatment efforts, increase treatment options and bed space, aid the development of non-addictive pain treatments, fight trafficking of counterfeit and illicit drugs, and more.
The House will vote in just a few minutes to wrap up two weeks of work on legislation to combat the opioid crisis, rolling more than 50 bills into a package they will send to the Senate.

Curbelo tells reporters there are 5-7 Republicans waiting for updates on negotiations. Leadership has agreed to keep the floor open late. The two sides - conservatives and moderates - will meet separately for now to discuss outstanding issues and see if there’s a deal tonight.
What now? Discharge petition still at 215 and it appears extremely unlikely the last 3 sign on tonight. Probably no vote on 6/25. Next opportunity will be 7/23. Curbelo just came back to Speaker Ryan’s office after votes but wouldn’t comment.
“We are very close,” McCarthy says leaving tonight’s immigration meeting. Similar sentiments from other members — still working but getting there. Unclear what happens to the discharge petition during this vote series. Last chance to secure a vote on 6/25.

Curbelo says he'll advise members to sign the petition on Tuesday with negotiations ongoing because, "I think it would guarantee that we have a debate and votes on the House floor." https://t.co/Zzb6d0qbSS
Most players in the immigration negotiation think the discharge petition will have 218 votes on Tuesday, but feel they have until 6/25 (vote date) to continue negotiating a bill.
It looks like yesterday’s flap over a new type of visa hasn’t totally derailed immigration talks — but RSC Chairman Mark Walker said that many conservatives would still view that as a special pathway to citizenship, which is a nonstarter. He did say negotiators made more progress
Here’s what Denham had to say about the idea of a new visa for dreamers: “It is something that was brought up and something we’d be willing to accept but it’s all about the details and we want to see it in writing.” Says they are holding firm to Tuesday petition deadline.
Breakdown down today's GOP immigration meeting with @vladduthiersCBS and @DavidBegnaud. A lot of talking, but not much consensus yet on where to go: https://t.co/2o69zQtEEJ
Ryan says the 2 hour immigration meeting was productive and that there is clearly a lot of consensus on the issue. “Hopefully we can find a path ahead that is consistent with the four pillars the president laid out and avoid a useless discharge petition.”
Rep. Denham, one leader of the discharge effort, suggested that mods wait a bit longer before adding the final signatures to the petition. “We are looking forward to seeing an agreement put on paper,” he said leaving the meeting. Timeline? Who writes? Ask the leadership, he said.
Leaving the immigration mtg, Rep. Walker said he got the sense the moderates will hold off on getting the last few signatures on the discharge petition. We’ll see what the mods have to say about that. If they don’t lock up the signatures by 6/12 they can’t get a vote on 6/25.
Can confirm - he just walked by the scrum carrying it! https://t.co/KlWWbyFmES
Ryan's message to members per source in mtg: leadership isn't trying to force the immigration issue, but rather stop the discharge petition. The ideas being floated aren't necessarily backed by the leaders, but are a result of the meetings with moderates and the Freedom Caucus.

Hoyer on allegations that Dr. Jackson was giving out pills to staff - and whether he has seen this on congressional trips: “It depends. If he’s giving somebody an Ambien, do I think that’s a problem? I do not.” But says it is a problem if dispensing of meds was “indiscriminate.”
Asked about Clyburn’s commends that leadership should step aside if the Dems don’t win back the House in November, Hoyer sidesteps. “We’re not going to fall short of the majority.”
Hoyer on Arizona special election: “Yesterday we had a win. This was a 22 point deficit district...Republicans spent millions of dollars to defend a seat that should have been a slam dunk for them.”
Less and less subtle as this speech goes on. Macron forcefully defends Paris climate deal, says US cannot just abandon the Iran deal. https://t.co/yZKCpAUeYX
"We signed it...We cannot say we should get rid of it," Macron says of Iran deal. Applause from Dems. Republicans are silent.
Lots of cheers from both sides as Macron applauds US efforts to negotiate with North Korea about denuclearization, and proclaiming that Iran will never have nuclear weapons.
More of this -- Dems enthusiastically cheer as Macron says he is hopeful the US will come back to the Paris Climate Agreement. https://t.co/y1pDUw21Fj
RT @deirdrewalshcnn: Macron warns US Congress on climate change - "let's face it there is no Planet B"
Dems leap to their feat and cheer as Macron talks about leaving children a planet that will still be here in 25 years. Republicans are more hesitating, but many do stand.
As he speaks to Congress -- a place where many members are skeptical of Trump's trade policies -- Macron says, "Commercial war is not the proper answer."
More Macron to Congress: "We can actively contribute together to building a 21st century world order for our people...express strongly that human rights, rights of minorities, are true answer to disorders of the world."
Macron's speech is a subtle push back against Trump's America First vision as he urges countries to work together and act with urgency to protect international institutions like the UN, NATO. Says nations closing themselves off to the world will not stop change.
Standing ovation for Macron when he quotes FDR: "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."
Macron: "We elected officials all share the responsibility to demonstrate that democracy remains the best answer to question and doubts that arise today...fight to make or principles prevail." Calls on leaders to establish a 21st century world order.
Macron walks through historical, political, cultural ties between the US and France: "The story of the United States and France is the story of an endless dialogue...this is a very special relationship."
Clearly Macron has read the coverage of his visit, and he's in on the joke -- less than 10 minutes into his speech, recounting US-France shared history, he cracks a joke about our leaders warmly embracing and kissing each other on the cheeks.

Schiff echoing Cummings on the Comey memos: They "demonstrate that the former FBI Director’s testimony to Congress and recent public statements are an accurate reflection of his conversations with the President."
Long statement from the Intel/Judiciary/Oversight chairmen - say the memos show POTUS wanted allegations of coordination between his campaign and Russia investigated, Comey never felt obstructed or threatened. https://t.co/gXC6fwrNZP
In summary, we knew a lot of this -- not surprising, since these were Comey's memos and we have been hearing Comey tell his story all week.
Trump brought up leaks of his calls with foreign leaders a few times with Comey. Once Trump mentioned Judith Miller and how jailing reporters to find out what they knew worked. Comey said he was a fan of going after leaks but "going after reporters was tricky, for legal reasons."
In a later meeting with Reince Priebus, Priebus Comey asked if he had a FISA order on Mike Flynn. Comey said he would answer but normally it should go through “established channels.” (Comey’s answer – yes or no – is redacted).
Comey writes Trump "then went on to explain that he has serious reservations about Mike Flynn’s judgment,” having to do with Flynn’s involvement in the timing of phone calls to the president after his inauguration. Comey did not mention any FBI involvement/interest in Flynn.
Trump brought up what he called "the golden showers thing" and also said he thought he should maybe ask Comey to investigate it to prove it was a lie. Comey writes he didn’t ask questions and said it was up to him, but also warned it was difficult to disprove a lie.
During that dinner, Trump also asked Comey whether “your guy McCabe” had a problem with him because of what he said about McCabe and his wife during the campaign. “I explained that Andy was a true professional and had no problem at all.”
Trump responded that he “needed loyalty and expected loyalty.” As Comey has said publicly, he did not respond.
Comey writes in his 1/28/17 dinner with Trump, he said, "I explained that he could count on me to always tell him the truth...But I was not on anybody’s side politically and could not be counted on in that traditional political sense.”
End of the Trump tower meeting: Trump "said he was grateful for the conversation, said more nice things about me and how he looks forward to working with me and we departed the room,” Comey writes.
“He then started talking about all the women who had falsely accused him of grabbing or touching them…and gave me the sense that he was defending himself to me,” Comey writes. Explained the FBI was trying to protect him from efforts to coerce him.
After Comey described the alleged Russian tapes of Trump with prostitutes, Trump said, “there were no prostitutes; there were never prostitutes” and told Comey he assumed the hotel rooms he stays in while traveling are always wired in some way.
During their first meeting in Trump Tower on 1/6/17, Comey says Trump told him “I had conducted myself honorably and had a great reputation” and was “repeatedly put in impossible positions.” This per memos obtained by CBS News.
Cummings: "Director Comey’s contemporaneous memos provide strong corroborating evidence of everything he said about President Trump—that the President wanted his personal loyalty, that he wanted to end the Russia investigation, and that he wanted Michael Flynn to walk.
A redacted version of the Comey memos have arrived on the Hill.

Pelosi says Dems proposed provisions in the omnibus to protect the special counsel. Republicans rejected that but said they understood how serious it was.
Asked whether firing Mueller would be grounds for impeachment, Pelosi shies away and just repeats it would create a constitutional crisis. Says Democrats and outside groups have been stockpiling constitutional experts since December to speak out if he does.
Pelosi echoes Schumer earlier this week, saying that during Mueller or Rosenstein will ignite a constitutional crisis. "The special counsel must be allowed to follow the facts," she says.
"What's happening this week -- and every minute it changes." I feel you, Pelosi. I really do.

Ryan says he does intend to remain as speaker through the election.
Ryan says he considered running and retiring after the election, but “my conscience couldn’t handle going out that way...in order to serve [my constituents] honorably, I had to serve them honestly.”
Ryan says his two biggest achievements are reform of the tax code and rebuilding the military (through the $1.3T omnibus passed last month).
“If I am here for one more term, my kids will only have ever known me as a weekend dad,” Ryan says of his 3 teenage children. Recalls how his own father died when he was 16.

“Win or lose it was a victory for the American people when they had to spend 10 million dollars to protect the seat,” Pelosi says of PA-18. Says it’s a sign of change to come.

@blue2win @WeWantConorLamb @Bencjacobs Yup. A few hundred votes is a really small margin in a race where more than 228,000 votes were cast. Most news orgs haven't called the race.

Unhappy fiscal conservatives —&gt; https://t.co/8KRhAFzcnw
Per Rep. Costello, the budget deal would also lift the debt ceiling for about a year. Congress was going to have to raise it in March, and folding it into a must-pass spending bill will be far easier than a standalone increase.
Happening now:	1. McConnell announces budget deal on the Senate floor; 2. Pelosi still speaking demanding a commitment on an immigration vote from Ryan; 3. House GOP leadership briefing members on the Senate deal (some applause heard)
We're over the two hour mark for Pelosi on the floor. Still telling stories of Dreamers from her colleagues.
A massive omnibus spending bill would almost certainly need Democratic votes to pass the House (and keep the government open). But Pelosi is saying that without commitment from Speaker Ryan to vote on legislation to protect Dreamers, she won't support it.
House Democrats have moved their retreat to the Capitol rather than Cambridge, MD because of potential votes to keep the government open over the next 3 days.
And it passed, 245-182. Your move, Senate. https://t.co/zmKigoQUrf
We've still got 48+ hours to another shutdown. So the bill the House is voting on - a CR through March 23, a full year of defense spending, 2 years community health center funding - will not be how this story ends.
Per Intel ranking member Rep. Schiff, Steve Bannon's counsel told the Intel committee this week that the WHite House continues to prohibit Bannon from testifying on more than a set of 14 yes or no questions.
After Conaway told reporters last night that he expected Bannon to comply with his subpoena for an interview today...the committee postponed the interview until next week.
Speaker Ryan on Trump’s comments that the Nunes memo vindicates him in the Mueller investigation: “This is about FISA abuse, this is about holding the government accountable.”
Coming out of conference, House Republicans sound optimistic about a plan to pass the latest CR — funds the government through March 23, full year of defense funding, 2 years of funding for community health centers. No debt ceiling. Will likely pass the House w all GOP votes.
House intel has a subpoena out for Steve Bannon to appear tomorrow morning. Will Bannon show up? Still unclear, but he said, "we have a subpoena for him in the morning and we expect it to be complied with."
After the House Intel meeting, Rep. Conaway wouldn't speculate on what the committee will do if the president decides to block its release. But he said he thinks Trump should release it.

RT @evanvucci: Speaker of the House Paul Ryan leaving the White House after meeting with President Trump. https://t.co/DGqSo6kab9
Ryan has left the White House, presumably headed back to Capitol Hill...where the ''no" votes are growing.
Schiff sidesteps Q on whether Nunes should step aside as chairman, says it's up to Spkr Ryan. But says events this week "not encouraging."
Asked why Nunes cancelled next open heading, Schiff: "There must have been a very strong pushback from the White House" after Monday.
Democrats on House Intel will push for Manafort testimony to be in open session but will allow some closed testimony if necessary.
"It is in the public interest to know what threats the nation is facing," Schiff says
Schiff says democrats support bringing Comey and Clapper back in closed session but not the cancellation of the planned open session.
Schiff says documents discussed by Nunes this week appear to have been a "dead-of-night excursion."
"I think this is a serious mistake," Schiff says of decision to cancel open hearing with Clapper, Yates and Brennan
BUT he also says all the surveillance appears to have been legal from what he has seen. https://t.co/c4BfYkOpPg
Nunes says from what he has seen there was no legitimate reason to unmask any names that were revealed.
This was voluntary, Nunes says. https://t.co/bmFK6iZotL
"There was no wiretapping of Trump Tower. That didn't happen." -Nunes
Nunes is still declining to name the source of the documents that led him to talk about unmasking of Trump associates earlier this week
And more Nunes: Paul Manafort has offered to testify to House Intel through his lawyer.
More Nunes: "NSA has kept us completely informed" but not expecting all of the docs he requested by today.
Nunes says he and Schiff are requesting that FBI brief the full committee, and are asking Comey and Adm Rogers to testify in closed session

So to wrap up that Comey presser: FBI not recommending charges, but scolds Clinton and State for careless handling of sensitive info
"This investigation was done honestly, competently and independently," Comey insists.
"No charges are appropriate in this case" is the official view of the FBI, per Comey
"We cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts." -Comey
"No reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case" despite known violations of law, Comey says of HRC/email
"It is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton's personal email account." -Comey
"The security culture of the State Department...was generally lacking in the kind of care for classified information" found elsewhere in gov
RT @JessicaTaylor: Comey: "None of these emails should have been on any kind of unclassified system"
Comey: No clear evidence of HRC/team intent to violate laws. "There is evidence they were extremely careless" in handling sensitive info
"There was no intentional misconduct in connection with that sorting effort," Comey says
Comey says it's highly likely that Clinton's lawyers' search for email missed emails that FBI later found.
RT @LisaDNews: OF @HillaryClinton EMAILS FOUND BY FBI: Comey says 3 contained classified information.
"We found no evidence that any of the additional work related emails were deleted" to hide them, Comey says
