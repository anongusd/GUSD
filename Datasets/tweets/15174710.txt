Not having reliable childcare has real consequences for families. 69% of working moms (and 45% of working dads) have passed up a job opportunity because they needed to take care of their kids. #Childcare4All https://t.co/NkzHROFJTk
Head Start and Early Head Start play a crucial role in #childcare because they serve a group of diverse children and families, and the #CCFWFA will help #HeadStart thrive even more! #Childcare4All https://t.co/EmroCrupAX
Families with a child or parent with a disability have unique child care needs. #CCFWFA will build more inclusive, high-quality child care options for children with disabilities and infants and toddlers with disabilities #ChildCare4All

A recent study found that nearly 2 million parents of kiddos 5 and younger have had to quit a job, not take a job, or have had to change jobs because of problems with childcare. We need to fix this so parents can show up for work AND their kids! Pass the #CCFWFA #Childcare4All
The Childcare for Working Families Act  is about making sure that every child has the opportunity to succeed and every caregiver gets paid a living wage. It‚Äôs a no-brainer! #Childcare4All https://t.co/bMPnlRsG9D
Child care in the United States is expensive and hard to find. But under the Child Care for Working Families Act, the typical family would pay less than $45 each week for child care. #ChildCare4All https://t.co/OqWEgl1lfV

#FACT: Detaining families causes unnecessary trauma to children and families, overburdens our current government systems and causes immigrant families to live in fear.#EndFamilyDetention #FamiliesBelongTogether #ProtectFamilies
Family detention costs on average $798 for a family (2.5 individuals) in comparison to $36 dollars a day for Alternatives to Detention- They are not only better for families, but they are significantly cheaper than detention #EndFamilyDetention #FamiliesBelongTogether
There are alternatives to family detention that are not only more compassionate for children and families, but also more fiscally responsible. For example, asylum seeking families may be released from detention through case management supervision program.  #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/UpHktQ94Qr
