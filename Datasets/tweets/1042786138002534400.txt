Do you actually want to help? Demand that contracts be renegotiated. Demand the privatized housing contracts not receive their incentives pay for a job well done. Demand mandatory fixes for toxic homes. Demand fines and fees be revoked for homes that are inhabitable.
The pretend by citing their outrage that this money needs to be spent for deteriorating housing. They don‚Äôt even take a minute to look at the fact that the money has been there and just been inappropriately used and huge profits made at the expense of families.
It feels like military housing concerns are being used as a platform for people to protest wall funding. Where was the outrage when these articles first came to the surface? There is no outrage. People just like to pretend they care about those living in toxic home.

@aaron4AD22 Agreed. DoD has the ability for oversight likely. But I have yet to be able to get a complete copy of any contracts even with FOIA. So I don‚Äôt know what they can do. So it looks like they can‚Äôt or choose not to.
@LivethLifeULove @jasonagastrich @Covfefe3623 @GavinNewsom The problem is they are tearing it up and falling apart without regard for safety. The base housing office has up until recent attention was brought has been doing little to nothing. Families trust it‚Äôs done correctly until they are sick.
@Kambearoz_rocky @jasonagastrich @Covfefe3623 @GavinNewsom Yeah. You‚Äôre not understanding my point. My point is that the money has been misspent for years going back to 1996. It has nothing to do with the president.
@ascott1985 @joebferraro @politico I have friends that have gone from 0 debt to 40K in debt from having to pay fines, fees, their on base rent and money to live somewhere safe and having to replace ALL their belongs. We aren‚Äôt cry babies. We just don‚Äôt want more kids to get sick. We need support.
@ascott1985 @joebferraro @politico Sir I am talking about the fines imposed by the on base housing when you try to move. Families are moving in not knowing about the issues and then having housing charge them extra fees and fine them. But my son was lead poisoned before I knew something was wrong in my home.
@ascott1985 @joebferraro @politico When you try to move you have to pay thousands of dollars in fees, fines and then also the money to live off base. Not that easy when it cost 7 grand to move. And why are tax payers paying for private contractors to make millions if not to provide liveable housing?
@aaron4AD22 Again, same thing. The appropriations are in total. Not for specific projects to fix the individual homes. For example: the funding that built a new community center should have been used to fix the raw sewage covered carpets. DoD cannot currently force that to occur.
@aaron4AD22 Sorry - to clarify. They can not appropriate specifically how the funds will be used for housing. They can appropriate the total amount that goes into the fund. It may not go to remediate mold but might build a playground. It‚Äôs not necessarily making homes habitable.
@WalterAppling @noonanjo We give our troops a nice life and you included housing? Have you paid attention to military housing in the past 10 years. Infants are dying from mold exposure, lead is poisoning our children, we are being lied to and threatened. The ‚Äúidea‚Äù of it is nice. It is not in practice.
@jasonagastrich @Covfefe3623 @GavinNewsom Yes, we can prove there is mold, lead, asbestos and vermin running rampant in these homes and the lies from the private contractors. I am a family that was made sick. This is not a partisan issue. Funding levels have been fine it‚Äôs the lack of oversight for years!
@aaron4AD22 This is inaccurate. The government has no ability to fix the housing. It‚Äôs privatized and owned by private companies. DoD can renegotiate contracts but they have no real powers. Btw I am the family is the article you posted. This is not a partisan issue.
@PA_Citizen @SenBlumenthal Its been going on since housing was privatized in 1996. Thousands of families made sick. This isn‚Äôt partisan. It is pure and simple lack of oversight and unethical business practice on the part of the privatized contracts. My son was made sick by our house. Corvias is to blame.
@ascott1985 @joebferraro @politico Please take a look at my feed. I personally know of hundreds of families affected. Including my own. My life will never be the same because of the illnesses associated with th home I was in. Please know this is real. We are real. And we are sick from toxic homes.

No one is talking about how military funding is actually being used for housing. They are just assuming monies would be diverted to housing to "fix" issues. There is more than enough money already appropriated to housing. The contractors prefer profits. AND HAVE FOR YEARS!

@ElBlayde @GenRobertNeller What‚Äôs worse is that the privatized contractors did not get cut. Only those receive BAH directly. Contractors still received those monies. So no - those funds still have the same levels and were not cut.

.@SASCMajority on Feb 13th you need to hear from families that have been effected by military housing. It is INSULTING that your agenda states it be investigating the conditions without anyone speaking that LIVED in those conditions
The senate will be hearing from the owners of the privatized housing BUT NOT FAMILIES! How can you know the conditions when you arent hearing from families! 	https://t.co/inP43pjePQ
Maybe this woman can go to school for early childhood education to learn how to teach kids with developmental delays that were caused by Corvias and their #toxicmilitaryhousing #nosafelevels https://t.co/FWw6vhbJz0
Corvias employees have told military families to have their pets put down or brought to a shelter instead of working with them to help families and their animals. How about #corviasgivesback these families feeling of safety and health in their #toxicmilitaryhousing https://t.co/TYcjUAgRIC
@KALBtv5 Corvias is still not taking responsibility or fixing the illness inducing issues in their homes. We had mold and lead in our home. We were lied to repeatedly, but made to feel safe even though our home was toxic! Improving turn around does nothing for sick kids!
@KALBtv5 #corvias allows for shoddy, cheap, quick "fixes" to look good. But leave their residents to deal with the after effects. My leak in my roof was never properly fixed. I then had mold growing through my air vents making my family sick #toxicmilitaryhousing
#Corvias claims they respond and complete emergencies quickly. I had the same 4 emergencies "completed" within 24 hrs but the problem came back time after time. https://t.co/3leJCasbt2

@TB_Times @BN9 @WFLA @10NewsWTSP @abcactionnews The families at MacDill are being poisoned by #toxicmilitaryhousing
A family sick from mold at MacDill AFB had a @RepGusBilirakis staffer tell them ITS NOT THAT BAD BUT YOU SHOULD MOVE. This is unacceptable. These are sick families with no way to get out of their home. They came to you for help and received insults. #toxicmilitaryhousing https://t.co/pg9ervgaCB

@FortPolkPAO Who will be represented at this meeting?
Ft Polk needs to show up and they need to show the photos of their homes! My #Corvias home at Ft Polk had mold in the air vents and lead and copper in our water. My son suffered from "unknown" conditions later to be solved as lead/mold related illnesses #toxicmilitaryhousing https://t.co/1HTEq8kyJN
Why not ask real questions? Brown, lead and copper filled water. Bleach being sprayed on porous surfaces. Families lied to about mold being told its "glue" discoloration. Children sick, mass developmental delays, SIDS, and families being poisoned slowly. #toxicmilitaryhousing https://t.co/HfKi7Fs7QM

@BdnLdl There are hundreds of stories - Ceilings falling in, rooms filled with sewage without carpet change out, mold in HVAC, mold in the floor, lead in the water. There needs to be a higher level of investigation! Families are scared to come forward for fear of retribution
A promise is only as good as the actions that follow. We must continue to push to hold #corvias accountable for their willful violation of their duties for monetary gain. We need oversight! And @SenJackReed to put his money (better yet John Picerne's money) where his mouth is! https://t.co/y7OUYYghuy

@atypicalstudent @LeighTuttle @Call_Me_Dutch Feel free to DM me and I can help you with some language that is specific to your situation.
@atypicalstudent @LeighTuttle @Call_Me_Dutch It does not. They are typically call in. I would specifically write a letter and hand it to them explaining that you are following the protocol in your lease write the date time and name of person you hand it to.
@atypicalstudent @LeighTuttle @Call_Me_Dutch Mildew is mold. There are test kits you can purchase or you can contact a third party. DEMAND those results and request them IN WRITING. Corvias typically has a mold addendum in their lease that states you need to contact them in writing regarding mold on porous surface.
