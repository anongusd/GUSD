@njennin It will be incredibly unlikely that they would supplement a swing of that magnitude. Not to mention a democrat hasn't held a seat in roughly 30 years.
@RNCResearch Lol Former Reporter...this was from CNN. The only "ploy" here are people like you preaching conspiracy, which you have demonstrated very clearly. 👍😆🤦‍♂️
Watched the Texas Senate debate tonight. I would say it was a good one, but Beto became somewhat deflated about half way through. Once he started to make false accusations about Cruz, his momentum began to fizzle. It will be hard for him to maintain supporter growth at this point
@RNCResearch Well I would say it was a good debate, but Beto ended up somewhat deflated about half way through. Once he started to make false accusations about Cruz, any momentum he had was lost. It's going to be tough for him to maintain growth of his supporters at this point.
@EmilyHaledon @BigBeefy27 @Sue4allofus @benshapiro Thanks lol. I just made it not too long ago. Didn't know bots were a thing until now lol.
@ronclintonsmith @realDonaldTrump Here you go...	https://t.co/lwX0mujdAF
@ronclintonsmith @realDonaldTrump Yea so you must have missed the message from Cherokee Nation that basically told her to go fuck herself.........
@linnyharris @realDonaldTrump It's okay...you don't get it, and that's fine. That is very clear. 👍
@EmilyHaledon @BigBeefy27 @Sue4allofus @benshapiro Lol yep that's me...the russian spy. My secret is out...have to tell Putin...
@linnyharris @realDonaldTrump #fakeprofilecopouts
@linnyharris @realDonaldTrump Lol guess I missed the part you added to my response about denying climate change...because that was never said. Also just because you can't understand the analogous relationship between your logic and the analogy I presented doesn't mean it doesn't make sense...it's just you. 😉
@60Minutes	Thanks for being the best player on our team! You just painted the perfect picture of the "media is deceitful" comment Trump mentioned during the interview. That bait she was throwing was priceless, as was her "I just saw a puppy murdered, and it's your fault" face. 😆
@linnyharris @realDonaldTrump Your logic is flawless! You know...I could get into a car accident today, so I'd better just stay inside or walk instead.  I mean...I COULD be killed. Probably better to just stay home, because there is a chance that it could happen...🤷‍♂️👍🤦‍♂️
@SharonAFerraro @60Minutes Your perspective is exceptionally uncommon here, Sharon. Many are too emotionally disabled by their hatred to see that. She most certainly didn't do the dems any favors with the bait she tried throwing at him. She fully confirmed Trump's comment regarding "deceit in the media".
@MimiWill @girlsreallyrule https://t.co/UElumuBnKZ		Just in case...
@MimiWill @girlsreallyrule Challenged him...that's a good one! 😆😆😆 Maybe we were watching different videos or something. 🤷‍♂️
@mitchellreports @realDonaldTrump @LesleyRStahl 😆😆😆 Oh man lol...that was a good one...challenged him. Good luck in November.  You are going to need it! She couldn't catch a starving catfish with that bait! 😆👍🤦‍♂️
@krassenstein Or he got tired of her bait trail. I'll bet is was difficult to maintain that "I just saw a puppy killed and it's your fault" face as he systematically shot down every effort she put forth to do so. If it weren't for journalists like her, our party wouldn't be as strong as it is.
@dawnie292 @girlsreallyrule That's why they made the "x" in the top corner of your browser...the more you know!!!
@girlsreallyrule If that was pressing him, the dems are really in trouble. He foiled every attempt she made to bait him while painting a very clear picture of the deceit within the media that Trump was referring to. Congratulations are in order here! You are the best player on his team!!! 😆👍🤦‍♂️
@ericbolling @realDonaldTrump @60Minutes Just when you thought the bar couldn't be lowered any further...now we know how it's really done!  She tried so hard to maintain that look of "I just saw a puppy murdered and it's your fault" face.🤦‍♂️
@kathygriffin Kathy has followers 😆
@kathygriffin If it weren't for the incredible amount of integrity and thoughtfulness you possess, we might have thought you were being a crazy bitch again.  It's good that your honorable and distinguished reputation say otherwise.
@shl @benshapiro Gotta love a good 'ol fashioned racist!  The color of our skin definitely has everything to do any successes we may experience, and the wage gap is evidence of that!  We should probably make less just to make up for it.  So which rich white democrats are you voting for again?
@Sue4allofus @benshapiro Do so with caution...we will say we told you so in the end.  Good luck tho!
@BastingCakes The Peters does not die...
@BastingCakes Just in case you were wondering...i does microwaves covfefe...
