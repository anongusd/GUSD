@ernietedeschi Yes, part of why I find a 3 percent GDP target silly. We can juke GDP a la Ireland (or Qatar). I prefer focusing on living standards.
@ernietedeschi Thanks for the back and forth.
@ernietedeschi Hallelujah. Yes, this is exactly right. Which is why I bristle at conclusory statements.
@ernietedeschi If barriers to offshoring continue to fall, we can leverage global labor abundance in lots of profitable ways.
@ernietedeschi More a broad orientation that prioritizes labor force quality over size of the labor force.
@ernietedeschi I guess I don't see embracing specialization in a globalized economy and capital-intensive business models as one silver bullet.
@ernietedeschi Denmark strikes me as a more appealing place to live that Qatar, but to each his own.
@ernietedeschi I'm personally interested in material standard of living (AIC, disposable HH income), not aggregate GDP, but perhaps that's crazy.
@ernietedeschi @mbusigin Yep. It happens that we have a fair bit of room to go on LFP and in the end, productivity is the main event.
@mbusigin @ernietedeschi (a) Perhaps! But "socialized" refers to a pretty wide range of systems; (b) Japan and Canada have pretty different SW, both have higher LFP.
@ernietedeschi Indeed. And level of migration required to offset aging is quite large. Adopting capital-intensive business models far more plausible.
Increasing US LFP is another possibility (as US lags behind many other rich democracies): https://t.co/RZONE3mVdE https://t.co/8XCHs1qrfS

@SWGoldman @JoshuaTMcCabe Can you see why that might be a less vivid illustration, and why these experiences aren't always cabined in professional life?
@SWGoldman @DHalikias I think that's overstating the case. My sense is that Dimitri is using shared culture in broader sense (norms of propriety, civic familism).
@SWGoldman @JoshuaTMcCabe It's a tradeoff. My sense is that the strategy of ignoring the professionally snide is actually pretty smart (but takes some discipline).
@SWGoldman @JoshuaTMcCabe As for not being a "good example," it's one that resonates but is vulnerable to ridicule from professionally snide people.
@SWGoldman @JoshuaTMcCabe Sure! And the vehemence of the response is, as always, wildly disproportionate, and speaks to a depressing pattern.

@brianmcarney @JonHaidt @Rob_Richie MMP systems and PR-STV systems are (if anything) famously stable -- more so, arguably, than FPTP systems.
@brianmcarney @JonHaidt @Rob_Richie There's a range of PR systems. PR-STV (this one, used in Ireland) is radically unlike those in Italy/Belgium. Same for MMP in NZ &amp; Germany.
I'm torn by backlash against THE BIG SICK. Much of it is overwrought and humorless. OTOH, it's a bad movie that's been overpraised.
@C_Garthwaite @onceuponA Yes, that's close to my view. (I ultimately want to see federalization of the dual eligible population.)
@onceuponA @C_Garthwaite Sure. I was referencing the background of a policy close to what Craig described.
@onceuponA @C_Garthwaite That may well be true, but it's misleading to not point out the explicit policy, which is to equalize the match.

@JonHaidt @Rob_Richie Thanks very much for the link!
@DLind @meusabsconditus You are an unusually thoughtful, open-minded, rigorous thinker, and your work is about a lot more than demonstrating your cleverness.
@henryolsenEPPC @Nate_Cohn Yes. And effective threshold in Irish-style PR-STV is considerably higher.
@cebpollster @Nate_Cohn Those were MMDs that elected representatives at large, not via PR.
@Aintropy @Nate_Cohn PR countries tend to have higher turnout. That's not necessarily causal, but worth keeping in mind.
@Nate_Cohn E.g., hard to draw majority-minority districts for Hispanics and Asians in relatively integrated regions.
@Nate_Cohn But I'm certainly open to alternatives. One of my concerns: addressing minority underrepresentation in absence of hypersegregation.
@lymanstoneky @KevinWGlass This is functionally a very "right-wing" position, and one that's widely perceived as inhumane on the left.
@lymanstoneky @KevinWGlass My understanding is that you favor limits on safety-net benefits and deportation on grounds of dependence on said benefits.
@Nate_Cohn Benefits of PR outweigh costs, and over time voters learn to navigate the new system.
@Nate_Cohn for different reasons. First case: ballot exhaustion needs to be compared to drop-off in turnout from first to second round. Second case:...
@Nate_Cohn I see a difference between RCV as instant-runoff voting and RCV as Irish-style STV in MMDs. In both cases I'd prefer RCV option, but ...
@Nate_Cohn I'd love to read your critique of RCV/STV. STV has worked quite well in Ireland and in local government.
@lymanstoneky @KevinWGlass I dare say that it's opposition to deportation that is the salient issue for many on the left, not a high foreign-born share per se.
@Kosteks The op-ed proposes a different method of electing representatives.
@ptbrennan11 @Rob_Richie @schaller67 These objections/concerns don't really apply to the use of a RCV/STV system like the one we endorse.
@rogerbeauchamp It's not your money if you only get it back for doing what the government tells you.
@conorsen (This is actually the kind of argument you often make: pay more attention to the structure, a bit less to what's on the surface.)
@conorsen There might be continuities, but US preponderance will diminish, which in turn will constrain choices regardless of ideological bent.
@conorsen Point is that its immaterial. As US represents smaller share of global GDP, as new blocs emerge, 20th century pattern unlikely to persist.
Er, I believe that was Hisashi Owada. https://t.co/WTCE3keNt2
