@zfree Understood. But nothing I said suggested that. One tweet could never exhaust the meaning of my interpretation of race. Got to consult many of my 20 books for that. In fact consult my last two books. Thanks sir.
@zfree Those two are not contradictory my friend: they are as old as dirt and yet as new as their most recent installment. He has amplified ancient hostilities. That’s an uncontroversial fact.
I’m shocked you don’t understand that your father has unleashed the worst sort of racial hostility possible because of statements &amp; actions that betray lethal ignorance &amp; fatal bigotry.

RT @DCJeniffer: @MichaelEDyson I had to quote you tonight in my thoughts on the #SOTU: https://t.co/hcoh3DoDmV
Instead of old white guys telling women what to do with their bodies, listen to 2Pac: “And since a man can't make one/He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one.” Focus instead on our living children who are decimated by unjust policies of an insensitive Prez!
My son @thedelegate24 just texted me this as he watches @realDonaldTrump deliver his SOTU: “So we are talking about boogie man invisible Mexican drug mules, but can't get into black people getting terrorized by police and others on Trayvon Martins birthday ?!” 🙏🏼 #TrayvonMartin
I wish @FLOTUS would invite to the SOTU all those black children bullied by her husband’s mean spirited policies and tone deaf words — by his vicious insistence that those who are black, brown, Muslim, LGBTQI are somehow less deserving of the protection of this country we built!

@BenjaminSWatson @JussieSmollett You’re missing my point my friend. If you think his being gay is a sin, that is akin to others thinking your blackness is a sin. There was a time when millions believed blackness was a sin. If you say they were theologically wrong, how is that different from your belief?

As ex church pastor, I stand with my friend &amp; brother ⁦@JussieSmollett⁩. Either God created everybody, or God created nobody! Stop using God to co-sign your bigotry.

@Im_gr8nss See my response to @TheShadowfresh.
@TheShadowfresh @iamcardib @STEPHMHAMILL Not at all what I’m saying. I’m saying her vocation is a performer, and she’s making a credible point and being challenged, not in her arena, but in @STEPHMHAMILL’s arena. It’s not a sing-off, but a debate. That’s my area. I can sing too, but it ain’t my forte! See the diff bruh?
What’s worse? @iamcardib enjoying the sexual freedom she deserves as a woman and citizen, or @STEPHMHAMILL slut shaming Cardi B as she exercises rights that conservatives claim to defend? Pick on somebody your own size Steph! I’ll come on and defend her position. It’s what I do! https://t.co/wkt13ajEKH
@BrownBikeGirl I’m suggesting that we give that metaphor a rest since it presumes a level of lethal intent that is problematic. Oppose fiercely, yes. Cancel, no.
@BrownBikeGirl I appreciate your care and concern. I however disagree. I criticized Bill Cosby in a book in 2004 and black folk got mad. Same with R Kelly in my Marvin Gaye book. I take critique seriously. I got years, skin and 20 books in the game. But one cannot cancel another human being.
@SE_DC_4life True. But that’s different than cancel. All I’m saying.
@lovely_chae Ha. Wonderful point on signifying. But he difference here — at least for me— is the rabid intensity with which that term is meant when directed against another human being. “Killed it” is not quite like “killed him.” Though both can be metaphoric for sure. The intent is the thing

@lovely_chae Beautiful. But all of that can be done without conjuring the vicious and dangerous notion of canceling a human being. Malcolm X was canceled by the black folk who hated him. It is, in my view, a reckless use of the term!
@lovely_chae What does canceled mean?
When black folk speak of canceling each other, it reeks of vicious beliefs about owning and exterminating another being that we bitterly oppose.

Be careful about self-righteous generalizations!
@EruditeNeophyte @RonHogan “If R. Kelly is guilty of the criminal offenses...he should suffer the consequences...This doesn’t absolve Kelly of culpability for his possible actions.

@ajbrooks298 @MsGladysKnight Thank you.
@CharlesPPierce @MsGladysKnight @IamSusanLTaylor Great point! Classic give-and-take, and call-and-response. They feed off of each other as they go higher and higher. Her voice more passionate, their playing more intense and focused! And how right about the hidden, or at least dual, meanings of the lyric. She’s a master of it!
@MaryPatHyland @MsGladysKnight Beautiful and eloquent tribute.
@Immaculate9E @MsGladysKnight 🙏🏼
@Immaculate9E @MsGladysKnight Bless you for your eloquence, insight and encouragement my friend.
@Wattm1Watt @MsGladysKnight So true for me too!
@Ofrkjr @MsGladysKnight Ah, yes, cascades of harmonies flowing down a mountain of melody.
@NiallStanage @MsGladysKnight @FJasmineG And please keep writing well about politics of our age.
@JamesTully02 @MsGladysKnight 😂 That’s hilarious — and so kind!🙏🏼
@CharlesPPierce @MsGladysKnight That’s the favorite song of @IamSusanLTaylor too! “Daddy Could Swear!” Oh my. The story it tells of a man who could neither read nor write, but commanded the podium through his edifying obscenity. Classic.
@davecdnb @MsGladysKnight Lol. Nah. Although I’m about to hit the sack. My going to the basketball game shirt!
@NiallStanage @MsGladysKnight Absolutely true sir. @FJasmineG offers a brilliant reading of the song in the context of black migration narratives in her seminal book “Who Set You Flowin’? The African-American Migration Narrative.”
@CharlesPPierce @MsGladysKnight “This can have a happy ending, no, no.” And given how you have brilliantly deconstructed the quasi-Presidency of our present occupant, it may have meaning for what we face ahead!
Had to celebrate @MsGladysKnight again! Her range of songs and styles is breathtaking. The solemn beauty, the ardent delivery, the majestic tones and yearning, mournful pleas that emanate from one of the most gorgeous and expressive voices ever is immensely gratifying. We ❤️ You! https://t.co/AcRN7dZFzD
@AA_for_Trump @MsGladysKnight Thanks for your autobiographical statement! But you’ve got time to stop.
@LVlovesHaven @side_eye_guy @MsGladysKnight Absolutely true!
Now that my dear friend #ArethaFranklin is gone, the reigning empress of soul is @MsGladysKnight. Her catalogue is rich and deep, like her incomparable voice, with tones sweet, haunting, vibrant— soaring, sweeping and soothing all at once. Slow, fast, mid-tempo, she’s a master!👏🏽

@Tomkowiak4All Bless you my friend for acknowledging those insecurities. Not my style. 21 books. 30 years. Awards. Love of students. I have skin in the game. You can google me to sample a bit of it. God bless you on your journey.
@jsager99 @Tomkowiak4All No, not at all. The description is her own. And she was angry at me because I challenged the avowedly racist mindset of her students. Back to the drawing board sir.
@Tomkowiak4All No it’s precisely the point. You offer the benefit of the doubt to a white colleague more than you do to a black professor. Most of her colleagues disagreed with her &amp; noted her defensiveness, it highlights the difficulty of white folk confronting racism. Doctoral students too.
@Tomkowiak4All What I’m confused by is that you assume I didn’t do just that. That as a professor for 30 years that I suddenly lost my chops. How many more stayed to listen? And how many other white students engaged? And that discomfort may be the prelude to growth and real learning.
@Tomkowiak4All Is it a virtue to stop listening to what you don’t agree with?

@Red_PilledKanye @idriselba What you’re missing my friend is that it only appears weird because we’ve accepted whiteness as normal and anything outside its precincts as abnormal, as “weird.” It was weird for a black president after 43 before him. It was weird for black homerun king. Adapt and make progress!
@JohnDorian111 @idriselba By that logic, the white actors only got the role previously because the directors are white. If it’s good for the goose, it’s good for the gander. White folk have played people of color for eons. Time to return the favor sir!
@AlgiersLady @idriselba Nah! Idris has paid his dues! 😉

Remind them that the single greatest force affecting us in regards to whether cops get brought up on charges and face a grand jury our courtroom or judge for killing us is local prosecutor. Vote and protest and organize like your lives depend on it. They do. #SOLUTIONSESSIONS https://t.co/w423qVecrT
Biggest threats: police aggression, unjust expulsion from school, opioid and drug addiction, resurgent white supremacy, sexual violence, and shrinking of economic and educational opportunities.

We remember that Trump ain’t worst we’ve seen — slavery, Jim Crow, KKK etc. Stay focused and determined to vote and support candidates who make a real difference: governors, prosecutors, etc. Then we plan to take back House and Senate or as close as possible. #SOLUTIONSESSIONS https://t.co/vPc5itiY1A
First we vote them in, and then we vote them out if they fail to do what is right. We put pressure on them by appearing at their town halls and other meetings. Then we collectively amplify our voices in groups of conscience as we organize our support or dissent. #SOLUTIONSESSIONS https://t.co/C4VuNOTWTQ

I replied before Church was raised. The substantive issue is me fighting anti-blackness on all fronts, on all continents. You have a problem with that? I do indeed believe in the performative: epistemology, ethics and resistance. Show me how it’s done son: where are your books? https://t.co/L4xCl52gxF
Come come now. Who said to a church in America? And if that, only America? I preach around the world. Stop the precious thin-skinnedness. And I see you’d rather fight me than Peterson. Cool. But again you fail to answer: if you and I oppose anti-blackness, why you fighting me? https://t.co/A1lFaI7nO1

That’s the point: he was deemed an interloper because he went where injustice existed to fight it. “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice anywhere.” You didn’t address my point: seems strange that you, who shares with me a passion to defeat anti-blackness, should question why https://t.co/gOabSGSGet
Basically because I teach. I write. I resist. I take receipts. And I will challenge any anti-Blackness with the sweetest of smiles and occasional growls. Plus, when MLK went to Birmingham they asked the same question. No I’m not him. Strange to hear YOU ask that question! https://t.co/4nSTdhqbYK

My take on the @Starbucks controversy. “If you’re not a star buck, you can’t sit in Starbucks. If you’re not hot chocolate on the menu, you can’t be the hot chocolate sitting there waiting.” A clear example of just how white privilege works! Author: @CNN https://t.co/mdEg14quDG

@JRH_97309 Labeled “it”. Black Lives Matter is very intentionally about black lives. As many have repeated on a plethora of forums, this movement is not saying other lives don’t matter.
@JRH_97309 @soyini_mad Well stated. Plus the fact that it’s sometimes also about other factors doesn’t negate that it is disproportionately about race. Example: there is a drug crisis in America that impacts all, but cocaine use by blacks viewed as pathology; opioid use by whites addiction.
@JRH_97309 Because some things are about race, some things are about police power, and some things are about both.
We must fundamentally alter American policing or we will continue to be vulnerable to the plague of unchecked police power and aggression. Philip Brailsford, the cop who shot Mr. Shaver, was acquitted of all charges. #danielshaver (2/2)		https://t.co/gSW4qGrxHn
