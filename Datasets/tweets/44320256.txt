@tresmonsieur201 @Vidyalata @unhingeunravel @mer3300 @zhawke2002 I'm pretty sure killing a 12 year old would kill the person everyone knows as me.

@mer3300 @Vidyalata @zhawke2002 As obvious as it seems to us, life and death are actually complicated concepts.

@VirginiaInCal @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump I don't consider him an honorable man. My point you're missing is that Trump disgraces himself even to ignore a dishonorable man.
@VirginiaInCal @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump The facts, removed of their partisanship are still a flattering eulogy that Trump or anyone could delivery off hand when asked. He served his country for __ decades, both in the military, where he was awarded __ honors and as a  venerated politician... Trump's just trash.
@VirginiaInCal @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump Agreed, and he still rises to the top of the GOP for integrity. Regardless of any of that, this shows the president's childishness and should anger rational GOP voters and politicians.
