Drug prices are a heavy financial burden for many older Americans. We need a plan to lower them effectively -- but President Trump's blueprint misses the mark for seniors. https://t.co/7pBBhDeROo #OAM18 #HappyOlderAmericansMonth https://t.co/P0SjJHFLYs
Companies in charge of at least 50 brand name drugs intentionally blocked competition from generics -- and Americans are paying the price. We can't let Big Pharma continue to get away with destructive behavior like this. https://t.co/aRHpygGTyF #RxForAll https://t.co/UGzaKQQ2ss

Older Americans don't often get a boost in Social Security income, and when they do it often gets gobbled up by Medicare Part B premiums. We must do more to stop this disconnect from happening. #SaveSocialSecurity #SaveMedicare #OAM18 https://t.co/CPoOVdAwWN https://t.co/to9yn6N5tM
