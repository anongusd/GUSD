@_waleedshahid @RashidaTlaib Wow. Interesting exchange
@mistressmatisse @_waleedshahid @SenFeinstein @sunrisemvmt @AOC @SenMarkey Will you say that about Bernie?
@gxsingularity @worpt1 @_waleedshahid The GND is currently a House Resolution with an ambitious goal statement, and I agree that it should be supported for its ambition, but in reality it‚Äôs completely unrealistic. Do you or any family drive cars? How many times did u fly on a plane the past few years?
@_waleedshahid Lol
@codeAfficionado @CNNPolitics Nobody is spinning anything. The entire Democratic Party unanimously called for Northam to resign and he chose not to. Nothing can be done past that.
@Olgold96 @SaboyTr @smalltownandrew @jetrotter Yeah, what they see in a black Somali Muslim with anti-Semitic tendencies is beyond me
@SaboyTr @smalltownandrew @jetrotter The most puzzling thing is 68% of her district is white.
@hershey_bar22 @THR Justice League was a disappointment. The DC cinematic universe is probably dead.
@CBeth061210 @Ilhan The DSA literally pushed to abolish prisons. The far left has gone off the cliff
@beijingsausage @AP Religion in general should be phased out
@IlhanMN @justicedems Will this be adjusted for inflation?
@nytimes I was wrong. Apparently second in line is Attorney General Mark Herring (D)
@nytimes If we lose Northam AND Fairfax we will have a Republican Governor until 2021
RT @AP: BREAKING: Spain, France, Sweden recognize Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as nation's interim president.
@wranters @CNN If it was 34 years ago, it‚Äôs possible.
@KEnglebrecht @CNN This is the reality of our political environment in 2019. Hopefully things will cool down.
@masg66 @Fabrice_522 @jaketapper I doubt the GOP could do much with Steve King still in Congress. I also doubt Democrats could be hurt by this seeing as 90% are calling for his resignation. I think he‚Äôll resign, but if he refuses there‚Äôs not much other Dems could do about it.
@Fabrice_522 @jaketapper In my honest opinion, if Northam holds out and doesn‚Äôt resign, things will more or less be fine after a few weeks when this story falls out of the news cycle. It is what it is lol.
@AnnieDuBois69 @RoKhanna @ewarren Let‚Äôs tax EVERYONE at 100% and make everything free! Free Teslas for all!
@LexMid @SollyMsimanga Without the jobs growing from the DA unemployment will be worst
@_waleedshahid A majority of Americans don‚Äôt support abolishing ICE
@RoKhanna But by your logic wouldn‚Äôt we be cruelly starving the Saudi people if we sanction them?
@RepMikeLevin I‚Äôm so glad that we now have a chamber of Congress controlled by a party that actually believes in climate change and science in general üëå
@_waleedshahid You need friends to co-sponsor legislation and vote for your policies. All she‚Äôs doing is isolating herself into a corner. Why would anybody co-sponsor important bills by AOC if they think she‚Äôs going to stab them in the back with a primary challenge?
@Bpeters75 @Jeremy_Chappell @justicedems @_waleedshahid @KatyTurNBC Yes but why does Waleed feel the need to attack Schultz based on his race and gender? This is the problem with Justice Dems. They have a good populist platform, but their peddling of identity politics is extremely toxic. Like how they fired Cenk Uygur for BS reasons.
@JDC5000 @sriniinpart @justicedems @_waleedshahid @KatyTurNBC He‚Äôs referring to why the entire white male demographic needs to be demonized because one rich dude decided to run for president, not defending billionaires. Smearing someone based primarily on race and gender is against liberal values.
@GiancottiJohn @KyleKulinski @YouTube Hillary did win the popular vote. It‚Äôs the polls in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania that really matters now
@realTylerZed The DNC was biased but the votes were perfectly legitimate.
@elusivepersona @AP Zero. The kid actually broke into a locked cabinet.
@Bighodagxl @AP So the kid who was old enough to know better than murdering his brother shouldn‚Äôt be held responsible in any capacity? Youth is just a ticket to commit crime with impunity? Society seriously needs to stop coddling our young people.
@CalveraGabriel @AP You‚Äôre right. The 13-year old is completely innocent in all this. Maybe you should adopt him and have him move in with you. Nothing could possibly go wrong.
@RethinkingEve @GovernorVA @HalaAyala Sex is already a protected class under current federal law. The ERA is only symbolic at this point

@GreatScott1991 Mueller: ‚ÄúChallenge accepted‚Äù
@JAdomian @SenSanders Big fan of South American dictators, are you?
@BenjaminNorton @SenSanders You missed the part where Maduro is a dictator who stripped the National Assembly of its powers once the opposition won control of it
@KyleKulinski @YouTube Your instinct is right that the US probably has ulterior motives in this, but purposely leaving out important nuances to back your inaccurate narrative that it‚Äôs a unilateral coup by the US is very disingenuous.
@KyleKulinski @YouTube I love how you leave out the fact that like 20 other countries have also backed the National Assembly, including the OAS and EU. Maduro also rigged his election and the  elected Assembly was simply following the constitution in the absence of a legitimate president
@cdbrzezinski @RoKhanna @SenatorDurbin How does that refute the fact that Maduro was fraudulently elected? Yes the DNC was biased, and it was wrong, but at least they didn‚Äôt rig the votes üòÇ
@F_G_R_V @GiancarloSopo @RoKhanna @jguaido Why would you vote in a rigged election? That‚Äôll only validate the illegitimate results.
@ChuckCallesto Because screw free speech right?
@justicedems I don‚Äôt support the wall, but I don‚Äôt see how fully funding other security measures is a bad thing?
@eugenegu @marcorubio @jguaido The fact that a South American dictator might rig an election in his favor is apparently a foreign concept for Eugene
@abaseman @SenatorDurbin Would you agree that the people complaining about the DNC rigging the primary against Bernie is just a load of BS seeing as you think a South American dictator is incapable of rigging an election?
@chelseybcoombs @SenatorDurbin Is it a coup if the person you‚Äôre overthrowing only got there through rigged elections?
@TheBoysBadNews @SenatorDurbin Totally, bro. Democrats are trembling after the successful elections of Senator Alison Hartson and Senator Paula Jean Swearengen!!
@KyleKulinski Merely backing the leader of an elected opposition is immediately Iraq and Libya 2.0. So idiotic.
@KyleKulinski Kyle ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like dictators but I will bend over backwards defending them‚Äù Kulinski
@karn120 @KyleKulinski But the sanctions are starving the North Korean people! How can you be so immoral?! We should immediately lift all sanctions without preconditions!
@KyleKulinski By this logic Kyle would oppose a democratic uprising in North Korea because it would be an illegal coup.
@karn120 @KyleKulinski Should we lift sanctions on North Korea?
@MikeStefanescu @KyleKulinski Maduro‚Äôs election was rigged
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Thing is, Maduro wouldn‚Äôt deal with these problems if he remains president.
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump I think the side that rigged their election (Maduro) would clearly be in the wrong. Many other countries from Brazil to Canada are also refusing to recognize him. Don‚Äôt play the ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù card in favor of a dictator just because u hate Trump.
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump To be fair there‚Äôs like 15 other countries that are now also refusing to recognize Maduro as president
@voxdotcom It‚Äôs not that toxic masculinity was attacked, it‚Äôs that if a similar ad was released about women or Muslims Vox and the rest of the media would absolutely flip out. It‚Äôs the hypocrisy that pisses me off.
@_waleedshahid @AOC Go away, communist
@MinearSgt @_waleedshahid @jljacobson An angry Twitter SJW leading an equally toxic organization knows more than the Founding Fathers? Nah.
@_waleedshahid Worked well for Germany in the 1920‚Äôs üòÇ
@nicolemchapman @_waleedshahid Yes, they should do a two state solution with 1967 borders, and divide Jerusalem in two. That‚Äôs the only viable solution, really.
@_waleedshahid Did you condemn the leftist protestors who similarly harassed and knocked a sign out of an elderly veteran‚Äôs hand during the Kavanaugh confirmation?
@jason_donner Trump is just being petty at this point üòí
@mattlav70 @voxdotcom Nah, it should really be a Muslim mixed-race black Chinese transgendered lesbian undocumented immigrant raised by a single mother. The true champion of the oppressed hierarchy üëå
@voxdotcom There needs to be a Chinese Cleopatra for maximum diversity and inclusion.
@AP Fucking China...
@RepSeanDuffy @HouseGOP They appropriated 1.3 billion for border security in their House bill, and they would be open to negotiate for a higher budget but are not interested in giving Trump red meat for his base. The wall is not popular and is a waste of money.
@MansGotInternet @GlenMosenogi @MmusiMaimane You need to fix the economy before inequality and poverty could be addressed.
@EileenDwyer6 @HouseDemocrats Waste of time and political energy. The Republican Senate would never convict Trump and public opinion towards the Democrats could take a hit if they saw the impeachment as political.
@ConklesToTheMax @KyleKulinski Why would anyone want to lead a successful business or make more money if they know the government is going to eventually take 70% of their hard earned income when they make too much?
@SteveScalise Didn‚Äôt Republicans impeach Clinton over a blowjob? Lol
@charliekirk11 ^Somebody wants a war ^
@megagujjar @KyleKulinski He pretty much ignores them. He did talk about them briefly in a conversation with Jimmy Dore about how they defied his theory that only far left populism will win. Kyle also curiosity ignored Conor Lamb‚Äôs win in a R +11 district back in March. Dodgy Kyle!!
@AMbradfield @KyleKulinski Name me a single Justice Democrat that won in a swing or red district.
@john_brumjo @KyleKulinski @clairecmc Did Kyle address the fact that the most competitive House district won by Justice Dems was like D + 13? Not a single Justice Dem won in a red or swing House district. Did he take responsibility for that as he advocates for them?
@baki_lao @KyleKulinski AOC wouldn‚Äôt win in a swing or red district. Only reason she was elected was because her district is is like D +25. You can elect a ham sandwich there as long as you slap a D on it lol
@KyleKulinski Not a single Justice Democrat won in a swing or red House district. Your record on winning isn‚Äôt that good either my dude.
@JacobAWohl Mental illness
@voxdotcom @ezraklein She should‚Äôve retired anytime from 2008-2014 when Obama was president and Dems held the Senate. She was already very old then, and retirement would‚Äôve made sense. The burden she now has with a Trump appointment looming over her is one she placed on herself.
@StefanMolyneux Republicans are mostly to blame for the explosion of the national debt. The wars and tax cuts under Bush, as well as Trump‚Äôs tax bill have exploded both the debt and deficit. Clinton left behind a surplus and Obama sharply cut down the deficit while in office.
@StefanMolyneux Parents are forced to work for 40+ hours because of stagnant wages, wealth inequality, and rising cost of living. You don‚Äôt deal with those root issues, parents will continue to work hard to make ends meet. Btw maternity leave can be paid for by the employer, not the taxpayer.
@voxdotcom I wish there was Chick-fil-A where I lived :(
@voxdotcom Russia and the Syrian government will still be there. Let them handle it. This war does not need the US‚Äô involvement.
@Deplorable69er @owelor02 @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump 54% of Americans also voted for a Democratic House this past November. Trump should be more moderate in his policies instead of pushing to fulfill campaign promises he has no mandate for.
@TeamYouTube Mumkey Jones. Reinstate his channel.
@mararap @helenzille @WelsWG @afriforum @Our_DA @BigDaddyLiberty The only people doing any robbing are the corrupt ANC and far left EFF.
@DrDannyBones @tbosekwn @helenzille @WelsWG @afriforum @Our_DA @BigDaddyLiberty I agree. Apartheid South Africa was a stable country and had a booming economy even under international sanctions. SA‚Äôs downward spiral began in 1994 under black majority rule. I don‚Äôt support apartheid but this is the inconvenient truth.
@tbosekwn @helenzille @WelsWG @afriforum @Our_DA @BigDaddyLiberty Instead of addressing SA‚Äôs many problems in a productive way, you instead want to go a toxic route and get ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù. This is why your country is doomed to be a failed state.
@kgotsoolebogeng @helenzille @WelsWG @afriforum @Our_DA @BigDaddyLiberty And you would trust the corrupt ANC government to manage all this land in a proper fashion? That‚Äôs what EWC is: a government land grab. It‚Äôs going to further wreck SA‚Äôs already weak economy.
@shshangase_6835 @helenzille @WelsWG @afriforum @Our_DA @BigDaddyLiberty By destroying property rights you‚Äôre only going to scare foreign investment away from South Africa and further drive your economy (with 27% unemployment already) further into recession. Look no further than Zimbabwe to see the disastrous effects of a land grab.
@IlhanMN So are the white people who elected you, and make up 68% of your district, evil and ‚Äúprivileged‚Äù? Why would you disparage the majority of your constituents like that? Would you stereotype any other racial group this way? It‚Äôs time to stop drawing lines of division and unite.
@Meliseymo @Mr_Ankrum @IlhanMN You wouldn‚Äôt stereotype any other racial group of being ‚Äúprivileged‚Äù. I doubt a poor white West Virginia family living in a trailer park are more ‚Äúprivileged‚Äù than Beyonc√©‚Äôs family. Liberals are supposed to unite people, not draw further division lines.
@brienlive @AbdulElSayed @justicedems Identity politics and tribalism. It‚Äôs their never ending narrative.

@skrewpa1 @StefanMolyneux Beats hunting and gathering
@525rubi @CHAVISTO_FRANCE @MmusiMaimane Nobody wants to live in Zimbabwe. That‚Äôs my point. Why is their new president now giving compensation to white farm owners whose land were seized by Mugabe? Because Zimbabwe was screwed by the same policies SA is now adopting. They never learn.
@CHAVISTO_FRANCE @MmusiMaimane It worked so well for Zimbabwe üòÇ
@Lilcoolkaybee @MmusiMaimane By stomping on property rights you know you‚Äôre only driving investors out of SA and spiraling your economy into further recession right?
@GOPChairwoman Omar is critical of Saudi Arabia. Called Trump our for his support even after Yemen and Koshoggi
@TheSpeaker2018 @StefanMolyneux It‚Äôs funny how Stefan rejects the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change but readily jumps on a couple studies that show blacks supposedly have lower IQ. But he‚Äôs not racist or anything right?
@eugenegu @neiltyson That‚Äôs why innocent until proven guilty shouldn‚Äôt just be a legal concept; it should be a societal value to live by.
@TJCornflake @KyleKulinski Third party = perpetual irrelevance. Feel free!

@RubinReport @benshapiro Why don‚Äôt you debate Ana Kasparian or Kyle Kulinski? They actually offered to debate and it‚Äôll certainly be interesting to see. Let‚Äôs be honest. AOC is an elected Congress member and isn‚Äôt likely to debate random talk show dudes on the internet.
@AP I wish there was Chick Fil A where I lived. I‚Äôd love to try their delicious looking chicken! üêì

@justicedems Does that mean that Ilhan Omar, who represents a 70% white district, is also demographically ‚Äúout of touch‚Äù w/ her district and should be raplaced w/ a white rep?
@RoKhanna @KyleKulinski But what is your answer to the Taliban possibly taking over the country once we leave?
@Dom3Marie You should sue Chipotle and the assholes who made the false claims.
@Nramirez71 @ianwilrel8 @tnkwenti @thehill Imagine if the government has a monopoly on phone manufacturing. We‚Äôd still be using flip phones rn because there‚Äôs no competition to beat. That‚Äôs why free markets are generally a good thing. Just needs proper regulation.
@Nramirez71 @ianwilrel8 @tnkwenti @thehill I support *regulated* capitalism. That‚Äôs why we have antitrust laws to prevent monopolies, etc. But free markets at their heart is good for for the economy. That‚Äôs why we have better iPhones every year bcs competition increases innovation.
@KyleKulinski I hope Ecuador kicks him out of their embassy soon. Or at the very least shut off his internet permanently...
@ianwilrel8 @tnkwenti @thehill I like private businesses. My food, my electronics, and clothes are pretty great because there‚Äôs private competition to satisfy demand. The thought of the gov running all that (socialism) is not very attractive.
@_waleedshahid @saikatc Don‚Äôt get cocky. Not a single incumbent Dem was successfully ousted except in two super blue House districts with friendly demographics. There‚Äôs no Dem tea party to be seen here.

@KyleKulinski You got evidence dude?
@voxdotcom 30 Out of 193 countries worldwide, the US is definitely part of the minority here. So ending birthright citizenship shouldn‚Äôt be a radical policy.
@justicedems Birthright citizenship is not a moderate policy though. Only a minority of countries in the world have it, and with a Conservative SCOTUS, they could definitely reinterpret US v. Wong Kim Ark and end it.
@frywill @KyleKulinski I don‚Äôt want Biden or Sanders to run. They‚Äôll both be ~80 years old and I want a POTUS who wouldn‚Äôt die halfway through their term lol
@nalini_jensen @TargetedInfo @KyleKulinski If that‚Äôs the case wouldn‚Äôt Green or Libertarian have much more support? There many reasons people don‚Äôt vote, not just because they want a third party.

@KyleKulinski The biggest mistake Democratic voters made in 2004 was to nominate a candidate that voted for the Iraq War *facepalm*
@CNN @CNNOpinion Every EU citizen should start spamming memes once this law is put into force. Allow No mercy in the meme war.
@TheYoungTurks @YouTube Sadly, Here‚Äôs how I think this will probably go: Kavanaugh continues his denial. The GOP believes him and confirms him. We get screwed by a conservative court for many more years. RIP.
@KyleKulinski The fact that 8 Democrats handed the NY Senate to the Republicans was unacceptable. It‚Äôs more than fair to attack Cuomo on his record/shady actions, which I know you already do. I just think it‚Äôs stooping to Trump‚Äôs level to be alleging voter fraud when you lose an election.
@SavionWright @eugenegu Snoop Dogg smoked weed on live television and he‚Äôs doing pretty good
@KyleKulinski This is equivalent to Trump saying that 3 million illegals voted. You lost. Get over it.
@theseantcollins @KyleKulinski @NYGovCuomo LOL sore losers

@voxdotcom It‚Äôs sad candidates are only running on identity politics.

@natparry @Reneeb4327 @SenSanders Hillary legitimately won the primary. What the DNC did to the tilt the election in her favor was unfair, but the vote wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúrigged‚Äù. She won 55% of the vote legitimately and that was that.
@compliancecamp @SenSanders A Trump apologist, I see.
@luigih1961 @SenSanders What the DNC did to influence media coverage in Hillary‚Äôs favor wasn‚Äôt right, but at no time were votes ‚Äúrigged‚Äù and there certainly was not voting fraud. Hillary legitimately won 55% of the vote and 34 states.
@nepaldude @SenSanders All the DNC did was tilt the race in Hillary‚Äôs favor in terms of media coverage. It wasn‚Äôt right, but no votes were ‚Äústolen‚Äù. Hillary did indeed win 55% of the vote and 34 states, whether you like it or not.
@bballnpolitics2 @nycjaneyvee @CNN 32 people have already been indicted or pleaded guilty. Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort is in jail. Trump literally just backtracked a minute ago and admitted there was Russian meddling. How many people were charged in the Hillary email scandal? ZERO
@DesmondKHarper2 @PHXGTR @nycjaneyvee @CNN That‚Äôs why we have a Senate that gives each state equal representation. But the President is different because he represents all Americans as a whole. That‚Äôs why every vote should be equal in value.
@rem_bison @nycjaneyvee @CNN Dems are on course to take the House this November, possibly even the Senate.
@ReavTim @nycjaneyvee @Tawanda99359155 @CNN It‚Äôs part of the political cycle for the party with control of the WH. You go all the way back to Eisenhower and even then the Republicans as the party of the president lost over 800 seats nationwide. It‚Äôs just the cycle.
@DirtyDard @nycjaneyvee @Tawanda99359155 @CNN If you took away the flyover states Hillary would‚Äôve won by a landslide.
@bballnpolitics2 @nycjaneyvee @Tawanda99359155 @CNN If Strozk really wanted to help Hillary he would‚Äôve leaked about the FBI investigation into the Trump campaign for Russian ties that was already going on before the election. He didn‚Äôt because he remained proper &amp; professional at his job.
@wizecrax @nycjaneyvee @CNN Yes but the idea that the Democratic Party is being abandoned is not as true when millions more people voted for Hillary than Trump, putting aside the EC. A party that is being abandoned doesn‚Äôt win the popular vote by 3 million.
@rashida_k @nycjaneyvee @CNN PA 18 was flipped. Dems also have a 9% average lead in the polls for the midterms.
@PHXGTR @nycjaneyvee @CNN Some random assholes vote in Wyoming shouldn‚Äôt be worth more than my vote just because we live in different states. As US citizens we should all have a equal voice and equal vote.
@KyleKulinski Open primaries are dumb. Why should other people who are not in my party get to decide who my party‚Äôs candidates are?
@atmoore68 @cenkuygur Move to Venezuela for a few months and report back how well Socialism is working there

@Look2yourlefty @KyleKulinski Bernie himself also also strongly denounced Trump‚Äôs behavior in the Putin conference today. This is not a MSM or establishment thing. Big story.
@OfficialSPGB @SenSanders Nah, Socialism sucks. It should‚Äôve died along with the USSR in 1991. Shame.
@CountDankulaTV It‚Äôs about time for the UK to adopt a real constitution and guarantee fundamental rights such as free speech and privacy. The fact that Britain doesn‚Äôt even have a Bill of Rights is disturbing.
@j4remi @NickAPappas @cenkuygur Would you really rather have Roy Moore in the Alabama Senate seat than Doug Jones. Btw, your dreaded red state Democrats also prevented 30 million people from losing their health insurance during the ACA repeal vote.
@TheDailyShow Did it really happen
@the_bernie_bro @KyleKulinski You mean the list you can be put on for urinating in public? Yes, great list.
@CNN A big thank you to the Bernie supporters who wouldn‚Äôt vote for Hillary because she and Trump are ‚Äúthe same‚Äù. Now we can be screwed by a conservative SCOTUS for many more decades! Hooray! RIP Roe v. Wade!
@KanielaIng @justicedems @Ocasio2018 A win in a single ultra liberal district doesn‚Äôt mean much
@cenkuygur @GOP Trump had always argued for a merit based immigration system so I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs inconsistent
@ChristinaTrulio @cenkuygur @GOP Only those who did fraud during the immigration process. I don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs a problem.
@CountDankulaTV UKIP should change it‚Äôs name if it really wants to remain relevant after Brexit
@primalpoly God bless capitalism

@ComradePangloss @JoshBroadribb @SheronWilkie @Colderthananice @GerardBattenMEP Oh yes, reading a newspaper clipping on public grounds is ‚Äúcontempt of court‚Äù, censoring the media with the threat of ‚Äúcontempt of court‚Äù is also OK in England. Just another day in authoritarian England.
@JimCognito2016 @GerardBattenMEP That‚Äôs not the issue at hand. If it‚Äôs a white person doing it they would immediately be arrested and jailed. But if it‚Äôs Muslim ‚ÄúAsian‚Äù men doing it the police would look the other way because it‚Äôs ‚Äúracism‚Äù. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a scandal; because PC culture enabled it.
@mattoidmattoid @GerardBattenMEP The whole concept of a media gag rule that is regularly imposed by UK courts is an injustice of itself. It is essentially criminalizing the free press and the fact that Tommy was arrested for that is an injustice.

@JoniCarley @SoFi Why don‚Äôt you move to Zimbabwe or something if you hate white people so much.
@ruthiegray08 @RockStarPreach @Uuriaofficiel @CNN @secupp Right?
@justicedems There‚Äôs nothing wrong with enforcing immigration laws. ICE shouldn‚Äôt be abolished, it has an important law enforcement role to play.
@DemSoLib @KyleKulinski So they have the same exact views on climate change, net neutrality, LGBT rights, Iran Deal, ACA, DACA, and tax cuts?
@terrabytes2 @KyleKulinski Stop talking about and just do it. I‚Äôm willing to bet you‚Äôll be less relevant than even the Green Party, which is truly an achievement in irrelevance üëçüèª
@jakerabbit25 @KyleKulinski This is why the GOP loves guys like you. Enjoy another 4 years of a Republican governor.
@JakeMaxBaker @KyleKulinski Work on fixing your draconian free speech laws that jail people for being ‚Äúgrossly offensive‚Äù before spouting off on us across the pond. Btw I‚Äôm sure the Conservatives with their incompetence and Labour with their anti-Semitism are perfectly lovely over there.
@CountDankulaTV Why is Free Speech such a hard topic for so many to understand? As an American I‚Äôm grateful for the absolutist approach we take on free speech. What‚Äôs been going on in the UK needs to change.
@ResistProfessor @SenDonnelly And what specific policy would that be?
@ge0rgiap0wer @justicedems So Dems and Republicans have the same exact views on climate change, net neutrality, the Iran Deal, the ACA, DACA, unions, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and LGBT rights?
@VP Funny coming from an administration that lost the popular vote and had a President that asserted blatantly false conspiracy theories like 3 million illegal immigrants voting.
@M1Catalyst @FredMonyak @AP @PaulWisemanAP What does this have to do with NAFTA?
@KingKush212 Everyone suffers in war, even including US soldiers. Many were drafted during Vietnam and didn‚Äôt choose to serve. The message of this post is nothing but toxic and divisive nonsense. BTW, is that Julius Malema the racist black supremacist in your profile pic?
@McQuanto714 @delajoo @ESlettebak @KyleKulinski So in your eyes our troops and veterans are nothing but idiots and tools for the evil politicians?
@ESlettebak @KyleKulinski It‚Äôs funny how some of these these YouTube political commentator goons speak like they got everything figured out but don‚Äôt run for office themselves or serve in the military.
@AtmaTheWanderer @Balarick @PamelaWilcox12 @KyleKulinski Totally agree. I think it‚Äôs legitimate to criticize Democratic leadership for bias where it exists, but overreacting and conflating bias with election rigging and voter fraud is extremely childish and unproductive.
@Selendrile @No1_Brooks @KyleKulinski If she couldn‚Äôt even win the primary what makes you think she‚Äôd win the general? Unless the point is to throw a tantrum and split Manchin‚Äôs vote so he‚Äôd lose. In that case the GOP thanks you for their supermajority in the Senate. üòÇ
@PamelaWilcox12 @KyleKulinski The good old ‚Äúit‚Äôs rigged if we lose‚Äù logic. Love it. I voted for Bernie in 2016 primaries, but all these cries of election fraud/rigging are about as sane as Trump claiming there were 3 million illegal voters. Lol
@ItzKhknight @KyleKulinski That‚Äôs how you give Trump a second term.
@WorldHistTess @KyleKulinski He actually has a good chance of winning. Manchin is a former governor and was elected twice to his Senate seat, winning 60% in 2012. If any Democrat is going to win in a state like West Virginia it‚Äôs Manchin.
@GHurricane @CNN Is your point that the US is the equivalent of Sudan? Cause if it is, it‚Äôs a dumb one.
@USA_Patriot2020 @KaipoJack @ZakkHazard @CNN It‚Äôs not ‚ÄúObama‚Äôs deal‚Äù it‚Äôs a deal with France, UK, Germany, EU, Russia, China, and Iran. But only the US pulled out because Trump has a pathetic vendetta against Obama even though the IAEA has confirmed Iran‚Äôs compliance.
@DSinCBUS @AP That‚Äôs such a retarded point. It was Iranian money that the US seized in the first place. We‚Äôre just giving back their own money.
@shecameundone @AP_Politics It‚Äôs never too late for Moore to concede.
@FoxNews @Sen_JoeManchin Let‚Äôs not kid ourselves. The only Democrat who has a real chance of winning is Manchin. He was former Governor and was re-elected to his Senate seat in 2012 with 60% of the vote.
@realDonaldTrump RIP Iran Deal
@AP Unfortunately I think the Iran Deal is doomed. It will definitely hurt America‚Äôs credibility and bring us closer to a potential military conflict. Shame.
@Annsman2 @GovernorVA Medicaid and Medicare are quite popular with the American public though
@marcorandazza @jere_bare Well put. This toxic sjw outrage culture needs to end.
@ISnowNothin @CPThrio You completely missed the context dude
@JessicaProis @jere_bare The pose is from a h3h3 video you fool. Do a little digging before you spout bs.
@jere_bare I‚Äôm Chinese American and I think you‚Äôre a pathetic loser, Jeremy. There is real injustice out in the world, and here you are sitting on your entitled ass complaining about a high school girl wearing a dress. Absolutely ridiculous.
@CNN Guess I‚Äôm boiling my lettuce for now on
@dcfoster_ @KyleKulinski NHS is plagued by inefficiency, long waiting periods, and lack of staff. The state even gets to decide who lives and dies instead their family, like Charlie Gard and Alfie Evans. The British model is definitely not for the US.
@SamPalasota @AP Hate to say it, but they are here illegally. They should either be given a rigorous process towards legal status or be sent home. This grey area they are in is causing major legal trouble/confusion.
@jrivera64 @AP Texas has been part of the U.S. much longer than being a part of Mexico.
@ddoann @JacobSevere @daumkeziah As a Chinese guy myself, I think it‚Äôs important that you realize you speak only for YOURSELF when you say the dress/pose is offensive. Your personal feelings alone doesn‚Äôt mean anything is actually racist or offensive. You don‚Äôt speak on behalf of all Chinese ppl.
@millypurr @QuinnTyga @daumkeziah You DON‚ÄôT speak on behalf of ALL Chinese people when you say the dress is offensive. If you‚Äôre PERSONALLY offended that‚Äôs YOUR problem. Not the person wearing it. Your personal feelings alone don‚Äôt make something ‚Äúoffensive‚Äù.
@CNN Poor llamas :(
@Hoosyourdaddy99 @AP That‚Äôs the argument people use to ban guns
@WorkandFootball @AP @governorjerryb I respect your opinion but I disagree. A western democracy like the USA has no business performing a cruel and backwards practice like the death penalty.
@WorkandFootball @AP @governorjerryb It‚Äôs obviously a horrible crime, but having the death penalty for it here in the US would be unconstitutional. It was settled by the Supreme Court in Kennedy v. Louisiana.
@HandyHoosier @AP Death penalty always risk putting innocent people to death. Capital punishment is already abolished by most countries, and even here in the USA it‚Äôs only for aggravated murder.
@KyleKulinski ‚ÄúYour‚Äù revenue? Advertisers get to spend their money on whatever videos they want. No YT channel is entitled to it.
@deeg25 @BetoORourke @tedcruz Major Democratic victories in New Jersey, Virginia, Alabama, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin so far this past year would beg to differ. A Blue Tsunami is coming and you‚Äôre just sitting on the beach waiting for it to happen. Lol rip
@paulajean2018 @RiseUpWV @WCWVI @WVYoungDems @justicedems @wvdemocrats @BrandNew535 @WVBats @WVUforPaulaJean @WVWorkingFams @appalachians_r As much as Manchin isn‚Äôt great in many ways, he‚Äôs still LIGHTYEARS better than any Republican trying to take that seat, which they will if a far left candidate like Paula Jean wins the primary.
@DankDirector @paulajean2018 @RiseUpWV @WCWVI @WVYoungDems @justicedems @wvdemocrats @BrandNew535 @WVBats @WVUforPaulaJean @WVWorkingFams @appalachians_r What do you expect him to do in that situation? Tell those kids to fuck off because he hates their sign?
@LeftwardSwing @dtmfman @paulajean2018 @RiseUpWV @WCWVI @WVYoungDems @justicedems @wvdemocrats @BrandNew535 @WVBats @WVUforPaulaJean @WVWorkingFams @appalachians_r But she voted for the tax bill. Did you support the Republican tax cuts?
@dtmfman @paulajean2018 @LeftwardSwing @RiseUpWV @WCWVI @WVYoungDems @justicedems @wvdemocrats @BrandNew535 @WVBats @WVUforPaulaJean @WVWorkingFams @appalachians_r You‚Äôre wrong. Manchin voted against the Obamacare repeal. It was close, 51 no to 49 yes to the repeal bill. He also voted against the GOP tax bill. I also believe he voted to override the FCC‚Äôs decision to repeal net neutrality.
@SenSanders I voted for you in the primaries in 2016 but your blind hatred towards free trade is making me seriously reconsider doing so again if you run in 2020.
@pewdiepie From your lesbian dad of course
@RooGideon @CNN That would violate the First Amendment.
@voxdotcom Unless the number is 0 it‚Äôs never low enough.
@AP Immortal
@APHealthScience @AP Tea &gt; Coffee
@mambotjie_ @johndoe387118 @CNN Inequality still exists because of a stagnant economy and lack of investment in education. All of this is caused by ANC corruption and incompetence the past 24 years. Just look at Jacob Zuma‚Äôs record. It‚Äôs not pretty.
@Mike11857392 @KyleKulinski I never said everyone should celebrate. It‚Äôs just that Centrist Dems will hold up Conor Lamb as a centrist model that works. When Kyle fails to even address it, it‚Äôs basically admitting his defeat because it seems like he doesn‚Äôt know what to say.
@profthornhill @CNN Locking up corrupt ANC government officials will help South Africa in infinitely more ways.
@kariuki190 @CNN It‚Äôs laughable that anyone should learn anything from SA. Its racist and corrupt ANC government has degraded the country in every possible way. Crime is rife, yet people spend their time complaining about the 8% (and shrinking) white minority! Sad.
@CNN And yet Julius Malema talks about slaughtering white people and nothing happens. This is a double standard in SA because no black person will ever be convicted of this, no matter how racist they are towards whites.
@johndoe387118 @CNN As an American, I‚Äôm glad my country actually respects freedom of speech. I hate racism, but it‚Äôs certainly not the government‚Äôs job to lock up people for saying mean things. ANC corruption is the biggest current issue in SA anyway.
@ThePosey96 @KysMomom @CNN It wasn‚Äôt anyone‚Äôs land to begin with. SA was largely unpopulated when the Dutch arrived in 1652. The current Zulu black majority certainly wasn‚Äôt there yet either.
@nytimes Elections in 2014 and 2016 didn‚Äôt quite show this ‚Äúunstoppable force‚Äù
@AP Yet they are by far the most protectionist country out there. All western social media companies are banned, and western movies released are limited. You can‚Äôt even do a Google search there. Fuck China. Tariff the motherfuckers.
@KyleKulinski What do you think of Conor Lamb‚Äôs victory in a heavy red district a few days ago?
@cenzinacouture @KyleKulinski @YouTube Still no excuse to completely dodge a major story like this whether you like Lamb or not. Both TYT and David Pakman for example, did a vid on it immediately. Kyle probably can‚Äôt accept that a Centrist Dem prevailed. Lol.
@KyleKulinski Do a video on Conor Lamb‚Äôs victory already. Are you at a lost of words because a Centrist Democrat won a heavy red district? You would be going nuts all over your vids if a Justice Dem won. Stop dodging already.
@KyleKulinski Stop cowering away from Conor Lamb‚Äôs victory and do a video on it, Kyle. It‚Äôs been 5 days already. Are you at lost that a Centrist Dem was able to win in a heavy red district?
@KyleKulinski @YouTube Stop cowering away from Conor Lamb‚Äôs victory and do a video on it, Kyle.
@KyleKulinski @YouTube Do a video on Conor Lamb‚Äôs victory. It‚Äôs such a big story for you to simply gloss over. Very odd.
@neiltyson Humans will be 5th dimensional beings by then
@david_j_martino @AP DNA evidence isn‚Äôt infallible either you know
@david_j_martino @AP Like the 4% of death row prisoners who are innocent?
@Jvburg @AP All I know is that when even countries like Russia and Mexico already did away with the death penalty, America has some serious catch up to do. Can‚Äôt proclaim your commitment to human rights when u kill your own citizens.
@AP Why does America still have capital punishment in 2018
@chrisneport @AP Use your brain please
@RWordplay @nytimes What‚Äôs your standard for ‚Äúappear‚Äù and what proof do you have?
@AndyWeiss11 @CNN Nah, I‚Äôd prefer to give him a Democratic Congress this year and vote his orange ass out in 2020!!
@CJTUCKERTRUPAT @pollsofpolitics What kinda logic is that
@CJTUCKERTRUPAT @DaleSul88119090 @pollsofpolitics There was already an armed guard at the school, so I don‚Äôt know you mean  by better security. Should there an armed cop for every 10 students? It‚Äôs ridiculous. Also, this isn‚Äôt just at schools. The shooting at Vegas concert was only recently. Can‚Äôt carry a gun everywhere.
@DaleSul88119090 @pollsofpolitics So we should just let them have it and not do anything? Even federal background checks?
@CJTUCKERTRUPAT @pollsofpolitics Well it‚Äôs still harder for lunatics to get guns with stricter rules and more background checks. Better than doing nothing and waiting around for the next shooting.
@AP As long as the ANC is in power South Africa is doomed
@Natenichols1313 @APWestRegion @AP We have to remain civilized. If we act like the criminals then what is the difference between us and them?
@jordancolbycox @CNN @CNNOpinion Because dogs are friends not food. I‚Äôm Asian but I think it‚Äôs barbaric and uncivilized.
@OregonGovBrown Hope NJ would also join soon after their new governor takes office
@sp_redelectric @OregonGovBrown How is polluting our coast going to solve any of that?
@VincentLloyd @KyleKulinski Because that‚Äôs a straight-up communist policy, and whether you like it or not, America is a capitalist society. How much wealth someone earns is their business and their right from the fruits of their hard work. Policy that derives from jealousy and bitterness is bad policy.
@joeymacjoeface @KyleKulinski Because we are the global superpower so naturally we have military influence all over the world. Same case for the UK when they still had their Empire and the USSR as well.
RT @RonWyden: Retweet if you care about @realDonaldTrump's tax returns
@michaeltpratt @WhiteHouse @POTUS Historians will really love Obama, especially when he's sandwiched between two Republican morons.
@CNN No way Scotland and N. Ireland stays in the UK after this.
@CNN @MaxFosterCNN Very disappointed in Britain's choice. This could set the stage for a second Scotland referendum, breakup of the UK
@TheYoungTurks lol
Ten minutes till 2014 here in Oregon!
@hazelzhou hi
