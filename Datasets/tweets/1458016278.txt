@SenhorRaposa How about letting Dems go the Nicole Galloway route? They could possibly have a shot if they have a candidate stronger than McCaskill. Like Galloway, Kander, Quade, etc.
@BenJKest @ElectionMapsCo @SenhorRaposa @EricPerless @jaketk33 @giulioiacoviel @ishabad @270needed @InsaneKaine @JMilesColeman @HoldenCasey @Aseemru @wildstein @_alex_joshua Woah! What towns went from Trump to Sherrill?
@joncprevo @JMilesColeman Fun fact: he went to the same high school that I did. They recently renamed the elementary school across the street after him.
@JMilesColeman Jones, Manchin, and Tester are the only Dems in deep red states left.
@SenhorRaposa @JMilesColeman Agreed. But there are up to 8 targets for the Dems in 2020: Gardner, McSally, Collins, Tillis, Perdue, Ernst, Cornyn, and Daines. There’s also an outside shot at Roberts’ seat.
@CATargetBot Denney will probably win the nomination. I doubt she wins even if Trump does end up losing the district in 2020.
@CATargetBot @NRCC Unlikely to be a threat to Malinowski. This district is rapidly moving away from the GOP.
@PutGameOnSwitch Ah yes, I remember my famous coaster where I took Cinderella to the ball.

New poll challenges narrative of GOP enthusiasm as a result of Kavanaugh confirmation process  https://t.co/TrWLMFJNs0
In the long run this will hurt the GOP more. Public opinion shifted against Clarence Thomas after he got confirmed, thus we got the Year of the Woman in ‘92.
Collins will be in deep trouble in 2020. She probably killed her reputation with moderates and Dems. She’s more vulnerable than any GOP senator that year sans Gardner.
Bredesen’s decision probably wasn’t smart, because I think there is plenty of anti-Trumpism in TN’s major cities. Most people who support Kav their would be voting for Blackburn anyway.
The Manchin stuff will probably hurt Schumer nationally for failing to unify his party against Kav more than Joe himself.
The Pro-Kavanaugh Dems like Manchin and Bredesen will be complicated. Manchin is still very popular in WV which is overwhelmingly pro-Trump and Kav. He’ll probably just lose some support in Morgantown, but nothing too major.
The effect will be most pronounced in educated suburban districts held by GOP incumbents or retirees, like mine in NJ11.
Guys like Dean Heller and Ted Cruz, on the other hand, have much more to worry about than beforehand. College educated white women will continue to flee the GOP rapidly.
Now that he’s confirmed, the enthusiasm could wane away. Heitkamp in North Dakota is in the most trouble. Republicans in ND are angry at Heidi for her vote but since Brett made it to court, they’re much less likely to punish her than if he was rejected.
Kavanaugh’s confirmation is not good news for the GOP at all. That midterm enthusiasm gap narrowing against the Dems was about the prospect of him being rejected.
@mcimaps @JMilesColeman Kasich definitely saved Balderson in Delaware. His endorsement helped separate him from Trump in the eyes of traditional conservatives. I think he got a lot of support from older voters in the county.
@RightWingWatch P
The candidate they need must speak to everyone who doesn’t like Trump. Biden would be good but he’s too old IMO. Sanders and Warren are too left. Gillibrand, Harris, and Booker are unlikely to have the broad appeal necessary.
Democrats can win in 2018 and 2020 by becoming a broader “anti-Trump” party. One with room for both Cenk Uygur and Ana Navarro. Bernie Sanders and Jeff Flake.
The GOP passed their tax cut but haven’t done much otherwise. They nowadays only seem focused on appeasing Trump and his base. Riling up culture wars is their strategy because they have no arguments to win.
They still have some differences from progressives. They may not want to #AbolishICE and are skeptical of #MedicareForAll, but they are putting aside their differences.
They fear the erosion of democracy and are angry about the growing mistrust of the FBI/CIA, intelligence agencies,  foreign allies and the news media. Meanwhile they are losing trust in the Presidency.
They are broadly behind #MeToo, and they want women to be free from sexual harassment and violence. Innocent men losing their reputations is not a concern for them. This is why the #WomensMarch was so successful.
They have recently shifted to supporting gun control. The #Parkland students really opened their hearts to the cause, and it turned people on the #NRA. Law-abiding citizens losing their guns is less important than keeping people safe from gun violence.
They are open to immigrants even if those immigrants won’t be living near them. They want to keep #DACA and oppose the family separation.
They are outraged at the rise of white nationalism and aren’t going to take “both sides” for an answer. To them, anyone protesting the white nationalists are heroes and patriots, no questions asked.
Their sympathies have largely shifted to #BLM rather than Police. It’s why they support Kaepernick and #TakeAKnee more then ever. They are white but don’t see themselves as facing discrimination.
Taxes and jobs don’t matter to these women. They vote because they want women treated with respect, racial and social equality, and freedom from gun violence. They also vote on environment and education, two issues with longtime Democratic advantages.
These women have moved to the democratic side. They voted Republican on economic/fiscal issues. Now they vote Democrat on cultural/social issues. The partisan divide is a culture war now.
Here in West Orange the GOP is on life support, hanging on solely because of older white men. Sherrill will easily win NJ11 this year.
Evidence has made it clear.  College-educated white women, especially millennials and urban/suburbanites, are a lost cause for the GOP. Bannon is right
So in the past month the left has	-Turned their backs on a rapper who criticized Bush.	-Celebrated the cancellation of a TV show.	-Mocked a Clinton supporter who is advocating for prison reform simply because of who she is.		You can’t make this stuff up, folks.
RT @FoxNews: Indiana teacher released from hospital after being shot while stopping school shooting https://t.co/Fd7zz2Pwk7
"Congratulations" to Neo-Nazi  Art Jones for winning the GOP primary! If you're a Republican, please vote for Lipinski. This piece of garbage belongs nowhere near Congress.
Many NRA members are starting to say the organization's leadership has lost touch with ordinary Americans. They may not be fans of "gun control" but are now feeling at least some regulation is necessary.
Furthermore, anti-Trump sentiment is giving this movement plenty of fuel. The "never Trump" wing of the GOP has swung hard in favor of gun control. Support is polling at around 50% with Republicans.
Even for those who have long supported gun control it was a low priority until two weeks ago. Also, when children are being killed the urgency of the issue is much greater than when it's adults.
Also mass shootings are written off as sporadic events by many. We just had three big ones in the past five months. Obviously people are realizing it's a bigger problem than they thought.
Standing on the opposite side of those students just makes you look like an asshole. Nobody can resist supporting them.
Those arguments are often written off by conservatives as opinions of the "liberal elite". You can't say the same thing about teenagers who saw their friends get shot to death.
Before Parkland, support sat at around 50% on CNN's poll and now it's at 70%. Beforehand the biggest gun control advocates were Democrats, big media journalists, Hollywood, late-night, etc.
There's been a huge shift in support for gun control in recent polls. I credit the Parkland students for shifting the debate.
@ThisIsTonya How big would this be in a normal week (without the Olympics)?
@ThisIsTonya Yeah, and total number of stories about #guncontrol?
@ThisIsTonya Also, how many stories are there on #GunControl?
@ThisIsTonya What prediction?
@ThisIsTonya I'm ready. What time will the graphs be up?
@mcimaps Hi Matt, Can you do a map showing the entire Stoneman Douglas zoning area and how they voted? There's several parts that aren't part of Parkland. https://t.co/QJnp81T9Nm
@djpressman @EricaChenoweth @crowdcounting How do i get permission?
@ericachenoweth @djpressman @crowdcounting I don't think I was heard the first time, but when is the February 2018 data coming out?
That was right after Vegas, though. No knowing how things changed since then.
That means 12% of Americans support gun reform without holding anti-NRA attitudes.
According to a Quinnipiac poll, 60% of Americans support stricter gun laws, but only 48% thinks the NRA is "bad for America".
You can also support stricter gun laws without calling the NRA a terrorist organization.
And maybe if we stopped pointing fingers at each other we could get something done!
Also to the media, stop romanticizing the shooter! Did we not learn that lesson from Columbine? It led to more copycat killings like this recent one.
Concealed carry is good but only with a permit and proper vetting.
The AR-15 ban won't be effective. Most people who own one would never think of committing a mass shooting. Most mass shooters would fail a background check as they were either mentally unfit or terrorists. Or both.
Compromise is always the best solution!
The best way to address gun control is by getting something that both the NRA and the gun control crowd can get behind.
Background checks, gun show loophole closing, and gun registries are all we need. No guns for terrorists, mental illnesses, or people with violent histories.
@ajamazing Yeah. Still has nothing to do with guns.
@shawn_keren No reason. It's my personal opinion.
@jjmoon66 You're mixing him up with Ted Cruz.
@ajamazing I speak for myself, not the survivors.
@shawn_keren Why's that? It minimizes the Nazi crimes in my opinion.		Democrats complain all the time when the GOP honors MLK. So we have the right to be angry when #NeverAgain is being brought up in a non-Holocaust context.
@ajamazing That's true. but #NeverAgain is still not about gun control. If you brought it up after Charlottesville, fine. If you were focusing more on his antisemitism than gun laws, they it's appropriate to use.
@ajamazing It's a phrase about anti-Semitism, not gun control.
@shawn_keren I don't. I think the slogan should be used exclusively for the Holocaust.
@marqgrossman Gun violence is horrible, but it's not comparable to the Holocaust in any means and tends to minimize the atrocities the Nazis committed. Please stop using it.
@mariecorfield As a Jew. I feel you should use a different slogan. #NeverAgain should stay exclusive to the Holocaust.
@jfkantrowitz @NeverAgainMSD @AMarch4OurLives IMO this slogan should never be used outside of a Holocaust context. It's disrespectful to Jews.
@ajamazing The JDL is a terrorist organization. They're not heroes. Also it is very offensive to me to see a Holocaust slogan being used to push Gun Control. It should be left as a holocaust slogan and nothing more.
I would recommend that instead of #neveragain you use a different hashtag. That phrase is about the Holocaust feel it's disrespectful to Jews.
Now this most recent maniac nobody can agree what he is.  The left are calling him white and the right are calling him hispanic.
But the left always demonizes white shooters and the right tends to pounce whenever the shooter is black, Hispanic, or Muslim.
Omar Mateen being Muslim was relevant because he was a jihadist.
Also, I don't like how people try to make the race of the shooter an issue. Dylann Roof being white was relevant because he was a white supremacist.
Bump stocks were designed for people with physical disabilities, but they've been instead used by psychopaths like Paddock.
Republicans are often quick to focus on mental health to dismiss calls for gun control. Democrats often dismiss the mental health issue and focus solely on gun control. We need bipartisan action.
People do have mental heath issues and yeah, that's a big problem that's causing the shooting. The guy in Florida was a psychopath and so was the guy in Vegas.
There are some gun control measures I support and some I oppose: Background checks are good and so is mental health training.
The NRA is really out of touch with most of its members. There are 5 million NRA members and there are several bills that even they don't support.
@ThisIsTonya One more thing. How many articles on Florida were there on the charts?
@ThisIsTonya @AshrafGarda @SAfmRadio Also look up Emma Gonzalez.
@ThisIsTonya @AshrafGarda @SAfmRadio I encourage you to watch Jimmy Kimmel on this topic.
@ThisIsTonya @AshrafGarda @SAfmRadio There's massive protests being organized by students teachers and parents alike. This time could be different.
@ThisIsTonya @AshrafGarda @SAfmRadio Polling data says Americans overwhelmingly support tighter gun control including nearly all Democrats and about 1/3 of Repubicans. Specific policy proposals are nearly unanimous across party lines.
@ThisIsTonya @AshrafGarda @SAfmRadio Even some GOPers are turning against their own party for their stance on guns. A mega donor just chose to stop paying the party until they tighten their gun laws.
@ThisIsTonya @AshrafGarda @SAfmRadio Florida does have elections this November. The Dems have a chance at flipping all three of them.
@ThisIsTonya @AshrafGarda @SAfmRadio They have a GOP governor and both of their legislative chambers are under GOP control.
@ThisIsTonya @AshrafGarda @SAfmRadio Yeah. There's demand for tougher background checks. I'm normally pro gun but I am now starting to think otherwise. Several states have tough gun laws but FL isn't one of them.
@ThisIsTonya @AshrafGarda @SAfmRadio Without the Olympics Florida would be around 38% midweek.
@ThisIsTonya @AshrafGarda @SAfmRadio Charlottesville was one of the biggest stories we saw on the charts even though only one died (not counting the helicopter crash) https://t.co/1l4fmSx0tf
@ThisIsTonya @AshrafGarda @SAfmRadio When most of the victims are children, 17 deaths can make a bigger story than 27 deaths.
@ThisIsTonya @AshrafGarda @SAfmRadio Ironically, Texas and Florida each got percentages around where the other shooting's death toll lands.
@ThisIsTonya @AshrafGarda @SAfmRadio Texas Church also only hit 18% but that got a full week and wasn't pushed down by another dominant story. https://t.co/ZXgkc2qhMq
@ThisIsTonya @AshrafGarda @SAfmRadio Same with Dallas and Brexit. https://t.co/3ZtYNoVxSK
@ThisIsTonya @AshrafGarda @SAfmRadio Orlando would have been one of the biggest stories had it not overlapped with the Euro. https://t.co/FTcSTpOJg7
@ThisIsTonya @AshrafGarda @SAfmRadio Also it coincided with another big event the Olympics.
@ThisIsTonya @AshrafGarda @SAfmRadio This allowed them to have a full week's worth by the time charts came out on Fri or Sun.
@ThisIsTonya @AshrafGarda @SAfmRadio It only had 3 days to accumulate. Most big terrorist attacks like Paris, Orlando, Nice, Charlottesville, Vegas happened over a weekend.
@ThisIsTonya @AshrafGarda @SAfmRadio #FloridaShooting would have been much bigger had it happened on a Friday.
@ThisIsTonya Can you get me the podcast when it's up? I don't have the patience to listen to the whole show. I don't really care about what's going on in South Africa.
@ThisIsTonya Hi Tonya. When will the charts be up?

How can I get it?
@ThisIsTonya Unfortunately I missed the stream. When does the podcast go online?
@ThisIsTonya @chaifm @KathyKaler @Howardsackstein And can it overtake the Olympics by Sunday?
@ThisIsTonya @chaifm @KathyKaler @Howardsackstein Cool. How big is the Florida story in numbers?

@ThisIsTonya @chaifm OK.

@ThisIsTonya Hi Tonya. When's the next chart coming out?
Hillary Clinton won the following counties:		Broward FL	Orange FL	Fairfield CT	Arapahoe CO	Jefferson CO	Montgomery VA	Clark NV	Charleston SC	San Bernardino CA	Pima AZ		They all have something in common. Not sure what it is.

@TonyaROI @chaifm @ROIAfrica Must be the debate and the Fox coverage of Wikileaks.
@TonyaROI @chaifm @ROIAfrica I meant everyone's talking about Trump. How is Clinton able to compete with him this week?
@TonyaROI @chaifm @ROIAfrica How is Trump not bigger than 41%
@TonyaROI @2OVfm @ROIAfrica Trump coverage should be much bigger next week with the tape
I'm back on Twitter, everyone!
Goodbye Class of '14.
Still can't believe the senior prank punishment. And most of them are exempt from finals! How will i get my sigs?
That yearbook signing was incredibly boring.
Watching #savedbythebell on Netflix. Awesome!
4 were weekends; 1 was spring break; 2 it rained on; and 1 I just forgot to wear shorts.
We've had 9 75+ degree days in WO and I only wore shorts to school once this year.
@carlyc43 happy birthday girl!
Happy birthday @zangerine from the dark. http://t.co/P7Ku72jlMW
@_micaelaaaa1 Hey, how many people are going to prom house?

https://t.co/NJZwC7mRlZ		Yes, this exists. @AlexBuchanan1 @its_alex_betch
@TheEllenShow Am i too late?
RT @TheEllenShow: If only Bradley's arm was longer. Best photo ever. #oscars http://t.co/C9U5NOtGap
Prom in 1 week!
@keith_caulfield @ArianaGrande @billboard Top 10? 425k should be enough for top 5, shouldn't it?
@kparisi_ Happy Birthday! Can't believe you're 18 already!
@AustinMahone should surpass @justinbieber in popularity soon. He's still far away from @onedirection though.
@gthot20 I was wondering, how close are @onedirection to surpassing @justinbieber's overall sales?
@keith_caulfield I was wondering, how many group debuted at #1 with their first two albums?
Spring's gonna take a while this year. Last year, spring never came until April. http://t.co/KEeZ2wyBQj
@val_Umeal Well, it's true now.
My paternal grandmother passed away this morning. #RIPSito
@thehitsradio#
@keith_caulfield How many bands had their first album debut at #1?
Hello Mr. Robertson! http://t.co/8yIYkTmy5W
@zangerine LOL I look like a goof
@amanda_scalora can u please help me with #OperationBeatRihanna?
#OperationBeatRihanna @onedirection Let's do this thang!!! http://t.co/IjX6Mktog0

@Gthot20 are you sure @onedirection are opening that low? It should easily sell 300k+ with the pre-orders, IMO.
@keith_caulfield @bwerde @gthot20 Do you have any news on "Story Of My Life"'s predicted opening sales?
@bwerde any news on #storyofmylife's sales figures?
@keith_caulfield any projections on #StoryOfMyLife 1st week sales for @onedirection yet?
@billboard Is this going viral?
Everybody follow @MrMooreWO on Twitter!
@chartnews what are the overall sales of @thewanted's EP?
@kparisi_ congrats on homecoming queen! Rumor has it the mayor rigged the voting. Is that true?
@Going_HAN You're still upset about losing homecoming king to Kosi? You deserved to win IMO.
@WestOrangePatch So, what happened at Homecoming?
@WOMountaineers any news on homecoming king+queen?
@woschools Can you please go over Homecoming results?
Sad irony, the other West Orange High School in Florida had a very high-profile homecoming this year, so ours has been greatly overshadowed
Great...I missed Homecoming again.
@keith_caulfield @bwerde any news on "Rap God" yet?
@keith_caulfield @bwerde Any news on "Rap God"'s 1st week sales?
#68signatures #seniorbeachday
@keith_caulfield @bwerde Where will #chinesefood debut next week?
@AlexBuchanan1 @its_alex_betch #samenameprobs
@LeeGoldbergABC7 @eyewitnessnyc will this rain be heavier than the August system?
@Evansweather @amyfreeze7 @jeffsmithabc7 What time does the rain start tomorrow?
@_micaelaaaa1 Happy birthday! I still can't believe you're older than me.
@keith_caulfield What are the odds "Baby Blue" re-enters the hot 100 next week?
@keith_caulfield What was the largest 1-day singles sale in the US?
@keith_caulfield will "Baby Blue" be able to re-enter the Hot 100 next week?
@JustAFanAL @keith_caulfield Drake.
@keith_caulfield @Drake I think you should still mention that he will be #2, though.
@keith_caulfield Glad you updated it. You should still clarify that @drake will likely be #2.
@keith_caulfield does @lordemusic have a shot at #1 hot 100 this week?
@vtezapss Please don't drop out.
@keith_caulfield @bwerde @lordemusic @Drake but how much will Drake sell?
@bwerde @keith_caulfield Are you sure that @lordemusic is going to outsell @Drake next week?
#mirrors playing on the radio! @jtimberlake
Bank of America...the only one in WO. http://t.co/Kwh3vzJdbS
Chillin' with @kparisi_ 's daddy...Mayoral swag! http://t.co/O7I3VwUAiu
@wwecrowe You know, there's an "X Factor" contestant named Sam Callahan. I hope you don't fall into the same position as @iLikeSamiZayn
@bwerde Do you think that Nine Inch Nails or Tamar Braxton has a chance at blocking Ariana next week, or is #1 in the bag for her?
@billwerde how is Ariana's album doing?
@billboard @gthot20 @bwerde @bbt40update Do you see "Royals" topping the Hot 100 soon?
@SullivanBooks You forgot to write about Drew McIntyre's short run in 2008 in the encyclopedia.
#tuesdaytrivia The Swagger Soaring Eagle!
@bwerde I know about how popular @ArianaGrande is now, but I want @nineinchnails to come out on top. What do you say about their odds?
@1dthisisus might have the largest gender skew in movie history.
@billyeichner If The Butler beats the One Direction movie at the box office then you are sexist.
Watching Anchorman on demand right now.
@sydneysquiress Hey, do you think that "This Is Us" will outgross "Never Say Never?"
@tmz @perezHilton you really need to see this #THISISNOTUS
#THISISNOTUS is still trending? That's odd, cause I don't see any news coverage of this.
TGI Friday's with family!
Wow! It's raining cats and dogs outside!
