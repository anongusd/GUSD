Confirming Thomas Farr to a lifetime seat on the federal bench would send the chilling message to Black North Carolinians that their rights will not be honestly protected in court. Senators must vote NO on this regressive choice for our judiciary. #StopFarr
Thomas Farr's nomination is part of an overall campaign by the Trump administration to suppress voting rights in America. Senators MUST reject his confirmation to a lifetime seat on the federal judiciary. #StopFarr

@rea_carey The National LGBTQ Task Force will do everything in our power to fight these proposed rule changes. We will not back down.
@rea_carey We have the law on our side, we have the medical community on our side, we have morality on our side, we have decency on our side. Most of all, we have an incredibly resilient transgender community leading us towards inclusion, justice, and equality for all.
@rea_carey: The rule being proposed is vile, politically motivated, and discriminatory.	Dehumanizing those you do not like is the hallmark of an authoritarian government. The Trump administration‚Äôs cruelty only further unites the voices of progress.
@rea_carey: Everyone deserves rights and protection. No exclusions. It is disgusting that leaders who are paid by the people of the United States of America would be using our tax dollars to purposefully deny anyone in our nation rights and protections.
@rea_carey: If Trump and other narrow-minded bigots in the administration are to have their way, these new rules would impact nearly every segment of society. This is an attempt to roll back civil rights. Anyone who does not conform to rigid gender stereotypes could be at risk.
@rea_carey: Transgender people are our teachers, doctors, veterinarians, veterans, business owners, clergy, children, parents, cousins, aunts, uncles, and friends. Transgender and gender non-conforming people are people, and no re-writing of the rules can delete us.
@rea_carey: The courts, science, medicine, and civil and human rights leaders are united in the definition of gender, sex, gender identity, gender expression, and gender discrimination ‚Äì no matter what Trump and his administration says or does.
@rea_carey: As a society and as a community, we have already moved on. We are here and not going anywhere. The National LGBTQ Task Force is fighting Trump‚Äôs heartless, extremist, and transparent political attack on millions of Americans.
In response to 10/21 @nytimes: ‚ÄòTransgender‚Äô Could Be Defined Out of Existence Under Trump Administration, the National LGBTQ Task Force‚Äôs @rea_carey stated: ‚ÄúTrump is too late. We are not going back to a time when transgender people were in the closet, were ignored or excluded.

The @Rev_Roland talks to us about the fundamentals of affirming our lives and each other. #BeYou and spread happiness, because it heals. So many of us have rejecting experiences with organized religion but please don‚Äôt lose your own spirituality. - Rev. Dr. Roland Stringfellow
Emani Love reminds us that #Detroit is 80% Black and located alongside ‚Äúhostile borders‚Äù created by redlining and racism. That said, there is a thriving justice movement here focused on equity. - Love

Eliminating the voting rights of our citizens, rights for which many have given their lives, is against the very basic principles upon which our country was founded.

And in 1968, Coretta Scott King offered her to be a leader in the civil rights movement, but Baker declined out of concerns for her children's safety.
Josephine Baker was an entertainer, a fighter, and an activist. 		Baker was awarded the Croix de guerre for her work in the French resistance during WWII...
Josephine Baker contributed in so many ways, she is a queer herstory heroin to remember. 		An American expat in Paris she caused a sensation on stage in Un Vent de Folie and became the first Black world wide superstar.

Southeast Asian American &amp; Pacific Islander women have some of the highest wage disparities. We need #AAPIEqualPay. #NotYourModelMinority
Today on #AAPIEqualPay Day, remember that AAPI women are not one homogeneous group. Burmese, Samoan, Hmong and Laotian face some of the worst pay disparities. We need equal pay! #NotYourModelMinority https://t.co/opKnymE0DH
Did you know? Bhutanese women are paid 51 cents for every $1 paid to their white, nonHispanic counterparts. #AAPIEqualPay. #NotYourModelMinority
AAPI women comprise 2.4% of the American workforce, but 4.4% of the low-wage workforce. They need #AAPIEqualPay and are #NotYourModelMinority
46% of AAPI immigrant women participate in the labor force and they need #AAPIEqualPay. #NotYourModelMinority
Not all AAPI people are doctors, engineers, and lawyers. We demand research, advocacy, and policies that acknowledge our labor so that each member of the AAPI community can achieve pay equity and economic security #AAPIEqualPay #NotYourModelMinority
Today is #AAPIEqualPay day, but mark your calendars for Korean, Vietnamese, Hmong, and Burmese Pay Day, and more. All AAPI women need equal pay! #NotYourModelMinority https://t.co/sJ6r1xZHeH
68% of AAPI #transgender women have been fired, not hired or denied a promotion according to US Trans Survey #NotYourModelMinority #AAPIEqualPay https://t.co/eVxux3p6u8
8% of #transgender AAPI women have lost their job because of their gender identity, according to the US Trans Survey. We need more than just #AAPIEqualPay! #NotYourModelMinority https://t.co/NuDzgTpGOK
How can we close the pay gap? Unionize! Union women earn $231 more than women without a union voice. #AAPIEqualPay #1uAAPI
13% of AAPI #transgender women have been harassed, physically assaulted or sexually assaulted at work. #AAPIEqualPay is not the whole story! #NotYourModelMinority https://t.co/JWPua34XB9
AAPI #transgender ppl experience higher rates of poverty than the overall #trans community and 6x the general AAPI population. #AAPIEqualPay #NotYourModelMinority
The AAPI community is diverse and experiences discrimination differently. We call for data equity and the implementation of best practices for AAPI disaggregation in pay equity research-- #AAPIEqualPay https://t.co/TXJFcsNHQs
Over her career, the typical AAPI woman loses at least $292,400  to the wage gap; in some states, the situation is much worse. #AAPIEqualPay #NotYourModelMinority
We need federal surveys to collect information on gender identity so that disparities for AAPI transgender workers can be collected and reported #AAPIEqualPay #NotYourModelMinority
