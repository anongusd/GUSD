@danielcincu @BernieSanders I make over 70,000 a year. Single, no dependents. After taxes, healthcare and 401k deductions, the rent on my two bedrooms apartment wipes out more than 1 paycheck. I get paid twice a month. It's quite impossible for me to own an electric car, let alone a family of 2,3 or more.
@danielcincu @BernieSanders Oh, no my friend. Oil is here to stay. Until a family of four with an annual income of 59,000 "United States average" a year can afford an electric car, oil will reign. Forced, expensive technology or legislation isn't the answer, especially to the detriment of taxpayers.
@danielcincu @BernieSanders Not in the slightest. Oil benefits everyone. Tesla's benefit ego's at cocktail parties.
@danielcincu @BernieSanders Tesla has never turned a profit. They are propped up by tax payer dollars and the stock market. Every American taxpayer shouldn't be on the hook for someone who can afford to buy a 100,000 dollar tesla without the 7,500 credit. It's insulting.

@davemcfox @ClaraJeffery @chrislhayes Solar outputs are generally 25% of their rated capacity. The cost of panels and batteries for such a low output cannot be done on a massive scale. The amount of overcapacity to make up for the dip at night, during cloudy days and the winter would be astronomical and untenable --
@davemcfox @ClaraJeffery @chrislhayes -- the largest natural gas power plant in the United States cost 1.2 billion and outputs 3,750 MW. It can gear up and gear down on a moments notice unlike solar or wind at a fraction of the cost.
@davemcfox @ClaraJeffery @chrislhayes You have to have static capacity that can gear up and gear down on a moments notice. Coal, oil, natural gas, hydro and nuclear have that ability. The largest solar plant in the us is the topaz. It cost 2.4 billion. It only outputs 145 MW on average with a 550 MW capacity. --

@DWalHeinz @cora_mccloy @Wimbledon Haha. Not mid court! About 10 feet back, past the out of play line. In other words, about 2 feet behind all the dead grass at Wimbledon. You can sneak a quick drink that way too and well as a handful of Chex mix....
@DanaPerino @FoxNews @DanaPerino @ChrisStirewalt Me just trying to understand the gerrymandering process. https://t.co/oJu52pScdr
@SharjohnsonMil @cora_mccloy @Wimbledon Haha. God, no, I would walk over like I used to do in college and drag over a plastic chair to mid court. The back is perfect for a towel and the seat is a wonderful cup holder.
@DWalHeinz @cora_mccloy @Wimbledon It always rubbed me the wrong way knowing those kids love tennis and are standing feet away from their Idols and yet most of the time they get nothing but indifference or passive contempt for not being quick enough serving them. Pat them on the shoulder and laugh with them!
@eorden @jaketapper @CNN Don't be like Jim Acosta. Not even Jim Acosta wants to be Jim Acosta at this point. I heard tell he can't enter any state south of the mason dixon line without being strung up.
@HuntsmanAbby Kids, why don't you go and play in the street for a while, daddy's nursing a hangover.
@cora_mccloy @DWalHeinz @Wimbledon Hell. I'd probably take all the kids out for fish and chips at every match in Wimbledon. That could be a fun tradition and it shows you're not a god. It's the least you can do for having them wait on your every motion during the match. I wouldn't have a kid bring me a towel.
@GMA Or just be a good human being and make sure your dog has water and isn't locked in a car for an hour.
@cora_mccloy @Wimbledon I can't believe no one's done it. Not for selfish publicity stunt reasons, but just to be nice and human. Especially buying the kids a meal. That's something they would never forget.
@Wimbledon I love tennis, but come on. Why do none of the players grab the towel from the minimum wage indentured servant and say have a seat? Enjoy the show, I can wet my own brow thank you. Afterwards can I treat you and the other kids to lunch or an early dinner?
@WhitfordBradley, I'm curious. Do you like being such a horrible person or does it just come naturally? You can't possible think that your time on the West Wing actually makes you a political and moral authority. Only a 5 year old petulant child would think that.

@dbongino The democrats AND republicans are ruining this country. Instead of pointing fingers at each other, solve the problems we face.
@JamesOKeefeIII And you're both destroying the country.
@JoeBiden @KatiePavlich When civil war breaks out we should make sure that every politician, pollster, pundit spend the rest of their life in prison for their reckless behavior leading up the the event. Virtue not being convent, or that I was told by others to do thus won't suffice.
@KatiePavlich I'm so sick of democrats and republicans. Making hundreds of thousands of dollars on the back of the working poor to try and further their careers. It's all fun and games until the second and final civil war breaks out. Then where will they be? Saying they didn't see it coming?
@HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @SenateDems The entire media, congress, keeps pointing the finder at the other, pointing out every flaw, Reminding the other constantly of it and being vindictive. That doesn't work in a marriage, why would it work for a country? It doesn't.
The @democratic and @republican parties aren't different. They only stand to point fingers at each other while the country suffers. Everything the other does is wrong. When you spend the entire time destroying the other how can compromise possibly take root?
--- We can't. Unless we fancy ourselves the Roman Empire, destined to Peter out after the great second civil war, I suggest the powers that be fix the problem by listing instead of taking. The good lord gave us two ears and one mouth. They should be used in that proportion.
--- I guess no one really cares when they make millions of dollars a year and take every moment possible to point out the others flaws when they make a mistake. How can we possibly survive in that climate? ----
----We can't agree on what to eat for lunch. The hucksters at CNN, msnbc, Fox News and so on keep perpetuating this cycle over and over again with the targeted end result being moral superiority or ratings. The country is the one being damaged by all this.
I don't think people understand how close we are to another civil war. It's not a game. The oceans between us keep getting wider and won't suddenly vanish due to "talking it out." Meaningful legislation hasn't been passed in decades. ---
Until term limits are enacted, nothing substantial will ever be passed in congress. Politicians weren't elected to get relected. They were elected to do the people's business regardless of what's politically convenient. Unless we want to become the Roman Empire, we need to change

@kayleighmcenany It was only a matter of time. All those Bernie supporters weren't going anyway and when you stand for free, government paid everything it's an easy sell regardless on how you will actually be able to pay for it.

@StephStricklen My dentist has told me for years that using listerine twice a day is much more effective than flossing with regular teeth cleanings. I've never had a cavity to date. Knock on wood.
@CassidyQuinn @YouTube You were really sheltered growing up. I remember when my mother left me and my older brother in a strange mans hotel room, "a guy she met online from New York" why she and him drove all the way to seaside for the day. True story. I had to grow up quick haha.
@GQMagazine @jillianmele God, I was so hot. It's no wonder all the ladies turned me down. The dirty rat tail, pencil thin mustache, computer and all black oversized clothing. They just couldn't handle it. https://t.co/GkmdRFWvHM

@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer It's great that you keep pointing to your pen in every interview, trying to damn the other for not being as morally superior as yourself while deliberately avoiding any actual work and offering up no way to fix anything. It's pathetic.
@dcexaminer Democrats keep moving the goal post. What's enough? Tearing down the wall, more innocent, legal, Americans shot and killed, more smuggling, more drugs, more over dose deaths. All of this virtue posturing isn't even for our citizens. Solve American's problems.
@JaniceDean Good old alcohol. Destroying relationships since the beginning of man.
@SenatorHassan You democrats weren't elected to spend 90% of your time on Non Americans and trying to become a celebrity doing countless interviews bashing the other party for not being pure and righteous. You all should be charged for treason and fired. New blood is needed.
@FoxNews @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump all the dems care about is everyone else, but Americans. Imagine if they put half as much effort as they do towards illegals as they do Americans. It's insane. Our 100 year old bridges, healthcare, trade, immigration, education could all be fixed. It's insane.

@elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump You act like you care about illegal immigrants, yet you had the opportunity today to pass legislation to give 1.7 million daca kids a path to citizenship. You don't have the right to comment on anything.
@Variety Haha. ABC's greed knows no bounds.
@SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump everything's broken. Immigration, entitlements, the filibuster and our political system in general. It won't be fixed now, but it will be at some point after I'm long gone. On an up note though, this water tastes good.
@FoxBusiness @SteveScalise This country is living on borrowed time. We need you to do what we elected you to do. Pass bills and make the country better, if you can't do it, get out of the way. Chinas right around the corner and gunning for us.

@JohnCornyn The fact that you know how to do this with your phone is both awe inspiring and frightening at the same time.
@SenatorTester You can put that on your resume after you lose reelection.
@realDonaldTrump I wonder how @NancyPelosi, @SenSchumer and @RepAdamSchiff are able to spend so much time in front of the camera in Washington when they were elected to solve problems and run the day to day operations in hell. The underworld must miss its top lieutenants.
@CNNPolitics Yes. Like why he chose to date a woman with small teeth and large gums.
@RealDeanCain Oh come on @kilmeade was way off base. You always have time for a publicity stunt.
@realDonaldTrump I'm from Portland Oregon. The worst dem cesspool this side of Austin Texas. When you think of a toxic waste dump, this is worse. I love hearing policy advice from part time baristas, who aren't above having unprotected, polyamous sex with random strangers.
@foxandfriends The education department needs to be dropped. It should have never been created in the first place.
@DailyCaller I would happily take Nielsen out to An evening of Mexican food. I think she's dreamy. I love a strong independent woman.
@CNNPolitics Haha. This reminds me of when Hillary said she didn't know what the capital "C" was next to an e-mail header. She was only the Secretary of State.
@realDonaldTrump Left leaners say when illegals cross the border illegally the first time it's only a misdemeanor. Drunk driving is only a misdemeanor. Should all drunk drivers get a greyhound ticket and a court date 2 years in the future they can opt to not show up for?
@CassidyQuinn Rule 1. Don't respond to mean comments. Rule 2. Repeat. They win every time, it's their goal.
@CNBC All this does is further the wedge between both sides. This country needs to come together for the betterment of society before it's too late.
@Newsweek You just described every inmate in our corrections system.
@prattprattpratt Do you think you're going to get work in Hollywood after your thoughts on god?
@larryelder This country can't take much more of this logjam. The dems in the senate and house refuse to pass legislation. It's their job. They were elected to work for the people instead of scolding the other for proceved lack of virtue.
@latimes This was done under Obama! The fake outrage is incredible. It's because Donald trump is president and all their Hollywood friends are faking outrage as well.
@JohnKasich Retire John.
For my next trick I'll make the democrats ask for family units to not be detained.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump To not*
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump I've never seen someone try no not do their job more than you Chuck. You were elected to work, not pass the buck on legislation.
@DylanRatigan Like it or not, this wedge is the best chance to actually pass something that resembles comprehensive immigration reform.

@MorningsMaria @jamesncantrell I'm waiting on the South Park episode.
@IngrahamAngle Better be careful Laura. The Libs are just waiting for you to slip up and they'll pounce. Watch your butt and don't invite Jeff Sessions on again.
@marilyndeutsch @fox12oregon That's a great idea. Let's just give the whole family a court date 2 years in the future and hope they show up. While were at it, let's tear down the border, get rid of the boarder patrol and let everyone in.
@mattklewis No. You have to be part of the echo chamber or no dice. Let's just tear down the border wall and let everyone in. If I were trump I would sponsor that bill however cynical and see if the democrats pass it.

@DebShaw18 @RobertPicardo If Bill @BillClinton didn't get impeached for getting a blow blow in the oval while lying about it, the @realDonaldTrump isn't going anywhere.

@ReaganBattalion @brianstelter @benshapiro I wonder what @brianstelter wants to do when he grows up.
@mschlapp I'm waiting for the day that a left winger panelist kills a trump supporter live on air and then begins to eat them while speaking in tongues.
@FightTheNazis @TheEconomist @1843mag @elonmusk 90% of the electric vehicle tax credit recipients are in the top 20 percentile of wage earners. It's quite easy to make it big when the federal government picks winners and losers at the cost of billions of taxpayer funded dollars.
@benshapiro @Comey Is so crooked, if he ate nails he'd shit out corkscrews.
@business They wouldn't even have to remove the prostitutes.
@kayleighmcenany I didn't think you were allowed in the MSNBC studios wearing a cross. It drives unholy creatures off.
@RobertGBeckel Are you going to take her advice?
@mduggan10 Great job in the Olympics earlier this year. I don't want to make you jealous or anything, but I once got a participation award for showing up to a baseball game.
@TheEconomist I could go for less sex in television. @HBO @STARZ would have you believe that a simple hello will lead to a threesome with a midget and a barmaid.
@FightTheNazis @TheEconomist @1843mag @elonmusk The average Tesla owner makes around 310,000 a year. The subsidy for the rebate comes out of taxpayers pockets to the tune of about 3 billion dollars (poor folk)  Around 83 percent of the rebate recipients made over 100,000 a year.
@TheEconomist @1843mag If you're @elonmusk it started with a 7,000 dollar tax rebate for electric cars financed by the poor.
@PortlandPolice Sorry officer. I had too much dinner with my wine.
@RealLucyLawless Have you ever gone as Zena warrior princess for Halloween. I feel I would be doing us both a disservice if I didn't ask.
@ashleyargota9 @tacobell I had a bae once. The doctor gave me penicillin. It cleared up in a few weeks.
@greggutfeld Can I buy weed from you.
@ashleytisdale @love I have the same problem with pornography.
Why does every relationship have to end in a grizzly death?
@LaraSpencer I really enjoy Flea market flip. I also like how there aren't any actual fleas involved.
@brookeolzendam Watch your purse.
@pattonoswalt A ham sandwich without mayonnaise is still a ham sandwich.
@RWitherspoon @draperjames My sister always dresses to the nines.
@CocaCola The sweet release of death?
@MisElizaJane When is Clarke finally going to put down roots, raise a family and stop stringing along love interests of both sexes?
@MelissaAFrancis Xi Jinping is clearly pointing to @realDonaldTrump fly being undone.
@Campbells I love all of your products. They're the perfect accessory to my milk crates and cinderblock, plywood shelves.
@lindseyvonn I hear you're single. How about a date? I've been busy weighing my options for years and crying myself to sleep, so I think I'm finally ready for a big commitment. You, me, dinner and some crippling self doubt?
@JessicaTarlov @FoxNews How many hours does it take you to put on all that makeup or do they use a cardboard cut out and spray gun?
@AmbJohnBolton I hope you are tapped to become the new national security advisor. Your candor and sensibilities are fantastic. Good luck sir!
@robertpatrickT2 No. CNN has been an action comedy for years.
@Richard_Schiff When are you going back to work? Your unemployment benefits should be almost used up by now.
@brookeolzendam Benny the bull.
@BretBaier @SandraSmithFox @BillHemmer John Bolton needs to find his way onto trumps team. He's such a straight shooter and an all around great guy.
@GB_ShortTrack @Elise_Christie @ISU_Speed Are you planning on participating in the 2022 games?
@JessicaTarlov How do you find the time to work for bustle when you're pretty much a full time commentator on fox? Inquiring minds want to know.
@FiveFanPS @DanaPerino @ChrisStirewalt The crossed paws is the best part.
@matthewhussey Easy. Don't get involved in a relationship to begin with.
@JennHoffKOIN6 I spent about a year and a half building a 7 story apartment complex a block from Szechuan chef. Lol It's such a small world! We ended up spending a lot of lunches at Buffalo gap.
@JennHoffKOIN6 The Chinese joint over on macadam? I've never been because it's always deserted and looks closed. How's the food? I highly recommend happy panda on 185th.
@oliviawilde Deadfall was your best work.
@StephStricklen @thef35 Who won the swimsuit portion?
@Disney Elsa from frozen should have been prescribed xanax. Problem solved.
@smerconish Did you ever think about wearing a wig? You could pull it off.
@taylorswift13 Can the new Taylor come to the phone or do you only send cryptic emoji texts that the entirety of NASA couldn't figure out?
@alyandaj You will forever be associated with Phil of the future to me.
@benshapiro I'd rather watch the 2018 oscars again.
@kayleighmcenany @ABC ABC news. It's like the American version of RT. Good luck.
@KennedyNation @connellmcshane @BretBaier @Theonlyhonest @JonathanHoenig @MattWelch @RepBrianFitz @ChrisStirewalt @DeirdreBolton How long does Brett bear last on a single charge before you have to plug him in?
@GillianHTurner Have you ever fired anyone before Gillian? If so, did you do it by text or unfriending them on Facebook.
@carmenelectra He isn't dead. He's living with Tupac and Elvis in Cuba somewhere. I found this out on the internet so it must be true.
@JennHoffKOIN6 Yes. I even laughed writing it.
@AJ_McCord So we gave millions of dollars to Miles Leonard so he could sit on the bench each and every game.
@trish_regan @KennedyNation I didn't know you had cancer. Awful stuff.
@KatTimpf You're mildly amusing and not unattractive. Sometime you'll have to show me on a doll where @greggutfeld touched you.
@JennHoffKOIN6 I was shocked when they let women vote. What is this world coming too. Next you'll want to drive and get jobs.
@ShannonBream @foxnewsnight Nothing good happens after midnight.
@tacobell Do you really live mas?
@HuffPost No one should be watching the bachelor.
RT @washingtonpost: A homeless man died, leaving behind a pack of alley cats. His neighbors came to the rescue. https://t.co/tvcyIISjeo
@RWitherspoon Everyone that first meets me thinks we're related after my last name comes up. No lie. "Are you related to Reece witherspoon?" "Yes, yes I am."
@washingtonpost The way she acted kind of freaked me out.
@WhitfordBradley Nice white hair! I saw you last night on the red carpet. Other than that you haven't changed much since the west wing.
@AJ_McCord @KOINNews I wonder what the record is for fouls in a quarter.
@ABC I never understood the fascination with James Dean. Rebel without a cause was so-so in my book.
@HuffPost It really is a bad movie. The rock and mark whalberg are very overrated actors, but they get so much work.
@brookeolzendam @CHold Just like @longjohnslvrs isn't actually seafood. It's ground up goldfish, raccoon meat or whatever else they can find inside a @Petco dumpster at midnight.
@StephStricklen Yeah, the same here. I only one I caught was Dunkirk. You didn't miss much except for giving away a jet ski for the shortest acceptance speech. It's way too political these days.
Great story. https://t.co/SpBAik7NaJ
@ABC I almost had to turn it of several times. It's very to political these days and the movie selection left a lot to be desired.
@StephStricklen Did you watch the oscars?
@FoxNews @cabot_phillips I'm fine with raising the age to 21 for long guns. I'm also fine with universal background checks, temporary restraining orders and banning bump stocks. That's the end of the conversation forever though. Yes, I own multiple firearms.
@KennedyNation Does it come with my very own gutter to crawl into when the evening is done?
@ChrisStirewalt That movie is roooooough. It's like smokey and the bandit 3. The gumball rally is often overlooked, but excellent.
@StephStricklen @BrandiKHOU My career high was working at a box factory for 3 days. I still wake up crying.
@robertpatrickT2 @ConnectCatholic I loved your hair in double dragon. When are you going back to blonde?
@brookeolzendam I thought only immigrants did that. I kid, I kid.
@StephStricklen My passenger seat doubles as a food tray. All the major food groups are present including some Twizlers.
@JennHoffKOIN6 @KOINNews @DICKS It's a tough situation. All of those poor people who are victims of gun violence mostly on the back of mental illness, but I'm starting to feel a little bad for gun manufacturers. Remington just recently declared bankruptcy. This country is changing.
@CassidyQuinn What souvenirs did you get in South Korea? I'm surprised you haven't posted any pictures of them.
@wweek The AR-15 isn't that good of a rifle. I don't know why it receives so much adoration. The round is small, its action is complex, especially when it jams. The AK-47 is a much better weapon, bigger round, easy action and it will even fire with a rusted barrel.
@ShannonBream @FoxNews @foxnewsnight The real question is why someone would risk 5 to 10 years in prison for a couple hundred dollars at a liquor store. Does anyone break into bank vaults anymore? Good old fashioned high brow crime.
@brookeolzendam Missing out on puppies isn't a big deal. You can see a box of puppies or kittens anytime you want on a street in pioneer court house square.
@JDMorgan__ you were great in episode two of JAG. What happened to your career?
@StephStricklen @chrissyteigen Passions are liken'd best to floods and streams, The shallow murmur, but the deep are dumb, So, when affection yields discourse, it seems, The bottom is but shallow whence they come. They that are rich in words, in words discover, That they are poor in that which makes a lover.
@StephStricklen @chrissyteigen For a woman as accomplished as you I thought you would have been deeper. Something along the lines of dostoevsky or moonlight sonata.
@StephStricklen @chrissyteigen @Chrissyteigen is a callow popinjay. I'd rather eat a sandwich.
@Elise_Christie I watched all your matches live. What a tough break. Especially that last match with the false start then the penalty. Are you coming back for Beijing?
@rickygervais The man in the high castle.
I accidentally watched 10 seconds of 50 shades of grey. I was able to stop hitting the 11 second‚Ä¶ https://t.co/QB6y42Nf3d
@CassidyQuinn did you try and retake a live broadcast?
@LockheedMartin Bribe an executive.
@KATUNews That's a lawsuit waiting to happen.
@GillianHTurner @FoxNews Working on a Sunday?
@GillianHTurner Every once in a while I eat all the French fries at the bottom of the bag.
@GillianHTurner I once hacked into my own eBay account after 2 years of not using it. I'm just that cool.
@MohanadElshieky So then just leave it at that. A good interviewer that happened to make a weird face. You meant it as a bit of a jab. I would have gotten a nice side by side photo with her and called it a day.
@MohanadElshieky Cassidy's a very sweet girl. She's an awesome beat reporter dealing with locals. The faces are her being young and immature.
@LockheedMartin Why not create a SU - 35 type aircraft with 12 hard points, 2400 mile radius fully loaded with stealth  technology that doesn't involve coatings. Slant wings, and so on. While managing to keep the price tag under 80 million a plane.
@StephStricklen @KGWNews @LockheedMartin For what the F-35 offers it wasn't worth the price tag. It's hard to believe they designed one plane to do three roles half as well as one plane doing each role that it was specially designed for. The f-35 replacing the A-10? Yikes.
@StephStricklen @CassidyQuinn 7 Olympic Games is impressive, although I think I have you beat. I once saw a game of cricket in person.
@CassidyQuinn @StephStricklen Haha. Making labels for chargers isn't much fun. Going to see the world compete on sheer skill level is once in a live time. If you can, check out the bobsled event. It's my personal favorite! Curling is also cool. Have fun!
@DanaPerino Illegal dumping.
@FoxNews @SenateMajLdr They remind me of chickens in one of those Tyson mills. If you look closely you can see them bend down to eat corn kernels sprawled across the floor.
@johnrobertsFox How does it feel to be one of the last non biased reporters left in politics? Keep up the good work.
@AaronMesh @wweek @JordanRGreen The Blazers weren't that bad. Some weed and a gun charge. The real crime is how cheap the tickets were.
@CassidyQuinn @TheSquare That's good! You're only human. Going 100MPH 24/7 is bound to take a toll. I was shocked when I found out you did the evening radio broadcast on the bull. I'm surprised you have time to sleep.
@CassidyQuinn @TheSquare Haha, right. You live to work! Even if you were on deaths door I'm sure you would try to make it in.
@ShannonBream @foxnewsnight @mercedesschlapp We all lose.
@CassidyQuinn @TheSquare You shouldn't work when you have the Flu. I'm surprised they didn't send you home.
@brookeolzendam I wonder how many Zebra's it took to make those.
@arnettwill I bet that's what Penelope Ann Miller said.
@TimbersFC @KOINNews I don't understand how you can get excited about soccer.
@Jeff_Curtin @NBCSNorthwest @RipCityRadio620 I wonder how Brooke would act if she locked her keys inside her vehicle.
@JennHoffKOIN6 Two years is outrageous.
@JennHoffKOIN6 That looks like compacted ice he's trying to shovel. That hill must be a death trap.
#NewProfilePic https://t.co/XRo9ufuvJT
@CassidyQuinn Those are hideous. They might even cause a divorce.
@MelissaAFrancis @ilmulinonewyork @Trattoria_NYC You must get that a lot being in NY. It's one of the liberal capitals of the world. I'm actually surprised they didn't burn you at the stake
@FoxNews @GeraldoRivera @RepJohnConyers It's called a slush fund. With tax payers money no less. Nothing surprises me anymore.
@MelissaAFrancis @ilmulinonewyork Don lemon's still on the air? I haven't watched CNN since October of last year. It was getting way out of hand.
@modernwest I was more of a Revenge fan. I think it was your best work.
@washingtonpost Take that San Francisco!
@CBSNews I find millennials more scary than death and credit card debt combined.
@JessicaTarlov @TheFive @FoxNews You're moving on up in the world. Before you know it they'll fire you for sexually harassing someone.
@KGWNews I don't believe in science says man who believes in rocket science.
@NathanFillion It's hard to believe you were on two guys a girl and a pizza place. Kind of like knowing I used to wear diapers and probably will again.
@ShaunKing @Richard_Schiff All posts like this do is divide people. Just because you disagree with someone, doesn't mean they lack every good trait one can have.
@summerwine22 @MelissaAFrancis @frenchysonline I wonder how many grades of school he completed before he dropped out? I'm going with 11th and he earned his GED.
@TheUnipiper @CassidyQuinn @KGWNews @TheSquare God Portland's weird.

@CassidyQuinn @PPBSunshineD lol, Nice form. It's all in the hips. Check out top golf in Hillsboro when you get the chance.
@ericschmidt Get rid of the tax credit and we will see. Nothing quite like giving a 7500 dollar tax credit to the rich, funded by the poor.
@CassidyQuinn @KGWNews Cracker Barrel gives you a free desert.
