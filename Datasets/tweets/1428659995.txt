.@galbeckerman: He was active when it came to issues such as Nicaragua in the mid-1980s, when Sakharov was effectively imprisoned and refusenik issues very much alive. So the question is entirely fair. You don't have to be in Congress to have an opinion on USSR. https://t.co/Lkb83LL7LA
Finally, I'd be delighted to learn that Sanders did, for instance, publicly campaign for refuseniks, dissidents etc. It would be great to see evidence that a candidate for president wasn't all-but silent for decades on the atrocities of the USSR, 1917-1991. https://t.co/aXCsr5hijT
These were major questions in the 70s and 80s, Sanders was active on foreign policy issues, and there were many ways to engage the issues. I'm genuinely curious to know the answers. A few vague references to Stalinist tyranny (Sanders no Stalinist) won't do. https://t.co/caKFoA3Gpi
Since this tweet seems to have upset some people, let me be more specific. Did @SenSanders: (a) publicly support the refusenik movement? (b) call for the release of Soviet dissidents like Andrei Sakharov; (c) denounce Soviet intervention in Afghanistan and elsewhere? cont'd https://t.co/9SbYyOm9Nb

Shame so-called conservatives and "originalists" can't respect the plain text of the U.S. Constitution: "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside." https://t.co/vPnSl9vNEn
Here's why, Senator: Trump routinely defames "globalists" and "international banks" and "corrupt media," all of which anti-Semites associate with Jews. Responsible rhetoric begins by not demonizing entire categories of people, or giving deranged people mental ammunition. https://t.co/TXgwVuUVmP

Trump isn‚Äôt going to be disciplined by someone whose views are dovish or establishmentarian. But he might listen to, and by tempered by, a responsible hawk. https://t.co/dcS7uvAQLt

(5) I'm not sorry I gave a commencement speech at a single-sex school, any more than one should be sorry for giving one at, say, Mt Holyoke.
(4) the heart speech is about intellectual safe spaces, and media bubbles, and ideological silos. It explicitly mentions the Fox News silo.
(3) your suggestion that I (or Shulevitz) are "making fun of rape victims" is misleading and despicable.
(2) lying about the safe space? Second, I explicitly endorse the safe space. "If such a space offered comfort...so much the better."

Trump looks stricken. At least he has the wit to know he was whipped.
Damn it. There goes Wallace asking serious, intellectually sophisticated questions again. We need @seanhannity here.
The world turned upside down: Hillary Clinton defends Reagan and wants to stand up to the Russians. The GOP candidate, not so much.
Can we just elect Chris Wallace instead?
Could Trump be more incoherent on Syria? He says we'd be in better shape if we did nothing. But also accuses Obama of doing nothing. Huh?
Abrupt segue from  Sanders to Aleppo disproves Marx's maxim that history moves from tragedy to farce. In this case, the opposite.

"Largely debunked"? By whom?
"Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger." Devastating. Also, a biting double entendre.
Trump had better be careful here, because he's risking multiple multimillion dollar defamation suits.
How do you miss $6 billion dollars? Decent question. How do you lose $915 million in a single year? More interesting. #ReleaseTheReturns.
Trust Hillary's tax plan includes massive rate hikes on foundations.
So far the winner of this debate is Chris Wallace.
Zero Facts Trump: Japan and Korea pay billions for US forces. Seoul has a huge army. Japan has been increasing defense spending for years.
Raising the national minimum wage encourages automation, throws the most vulnerable and least skilled off the the jobs ladder.
We cannot afford to defend Japan? Last time they defended themselves it didn't end up so well.
Most important question of this evening is how to score Hillary's speaking fees.

The good news for Trump: He survives thru Nov. 8. The bad news for GOP: There goes the last chance to replace him. And he still loses.
If this debate is about exceeding/underperforming expectations, Trump is winning handily (after a rough start). Hate to say it, but true.
Trump just gave his strongest answer of the night.
Why is Hillary flubbing this answer? And why is she not killing it in this debate? Over-confidence doesn't help a debater.
Martha Raddatz needs to stop acting as Hillary's surrogate.
Donald could have killed her with this answer. But now he admits he's effectively pro-Assad.
The author of the Russian reset "took on" Russia? Please.
"The situation in Syria is catastrophic." Correct. Because the policy of the Obama administration has been catastrophic.
Taxes: Trump's best answer so far.
