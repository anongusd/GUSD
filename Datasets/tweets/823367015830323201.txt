DRIVE THEM OUT of your places of worship. DRIVE THEM OUT of your communities. DRIVE THEM OUT of your holy land&amp;DRIVE THEM OUT OF THIS EARTH!
A better future is only possible if your nations drive out the terrorists and extremists. Drive. Them. Out!
It is a choice between two futures ‚Äì and it is a choice America CANNOT make for you.
The nations of the Middle East will have to decide what kind of future they want for themselves, for their countries, &amp; for their children.
But the nations of the Middle East cannot wait for American power to crush this enemy for them.
America is prepared to stand with you ‚Äì in pursuit of shared interests and common security.
Terrorism has spread across the world.  But the path to peace begins right here, on this ancient soil, in this sacred land.
This is a battle between Good and Evil.
This is a battle between barbaric criminals who seek to obliterate human life, and decent people of all religions who seek to protect it.
Peaceful societies will become engulfed by violence. And the futures of many generations will be sadly squandered.
If we do not act against this organized terror, then we know what will happen. Terrorism‚Äôs devastation of life will continue to spread.
Terrorists do not worship God, they worship death.
Every time a terrorist murders an innocent person, and falsely invokes the name of God, it should be an insult to every person of faith.
We now face a humanitarian and security disaster in this region that is spreading across the planet. #POTUSAbroad
This future can only be achieved through defeating terrorism and the ideology that drives it. #POTUSAbroad
With God‚Äôs help, this summit will mark the beginning of the end for those who practice terror and spread its vile creed. #POTUSABroad
I stand before you as a representative of the American People, to deliver a message of friendship and hope. #POTUSAbroad
