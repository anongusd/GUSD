Governor Branch (1817-1820) had the longest post-governorship at more than 42 years. He went on to be a US Senator, Secretary of the Navy, member of the US House of Representatives, and Governor of Florida (in that order). He was also from Halifax County(!) and is buried there.
There have been no living former governors (only the incumbent) three times in the state's history.		Caswell from Nov 12, 1776 until Apr 20, 1780 (because, duh)	Morrison from Nov 9, 1924 until January 14, 1925 and	Hodges from April 16, 1958 until January 1, 1961
Close! There were ten current and former governors living from December 15, 1865 until August 27, 1866. Swain, Morehead, Graham, Manly, Reid, Bragg, Clark, Vance, Holden, and Worth. https://t.co/DvWW0HYEmM

@MattBrubakerNC Always heard that pigs get fed; hogs get slaughtered. 2011 may have been the year when the gerrymandering pig became a hog.
@MattBrubakerNC That '90s tech had been improved by 2011 and that round of redistricting saw even more extreme use of that tech in mapmaking
@MattBrubakerNC Increasing gerrymandering in the '90s was a direct result of technology (my point) along w/ VRA changes.
@MattBrubakerNC The 1992 12th would be par for the course as part of the 2011 map. But that district was ruled unconstitutional.
@MattBrubakerNC Got more extreme over time because technological capabilities allowed it. Wouldn't have mattered who was in charge.
@MattBrubakerNC Sure, that contrast being a prime example. But GOP redistricting isn't the problem; 21st century tech in redistricting is.
@GrahamDavidA @FiveThirtyEight Does that mean original count of recounted Durham votes was more accurate than national average?
@MattBrubakerNC Here's a comparison of Dem-drawn 1971 map &amp; GOP-drawn 2011 map. Gerrymandering has gotten worse over time. Period. #ncpol https://t.co/KhpW3zsUpk
@MattBrubakerNC That newer, cleaner map was a result of federal courts ruling the 2011 GOP maps (the "old" map in that gif) unconstitutional

Important thing I haven't seen yet is county commission control. Majority of boards (53) became Repub in 2012. Local decisions matter fast.
Finally, more than 1 in 4 of Cooper's votes came from Wake &amp; Mecklenburg.
Meanwhile all counties outperforming '08-'16 Dem governor average &gt;5% are urban w exception of Watauga (Meck Wake Orange Cabarrus &amp; Durham)
Don't have the numbers handy but would imagine he will break much longer records in any of those traditionally blue rural eastern counties.
McCrory currently ahead in Gates, Bladen, Martin, and Robeson. Would be first Republican to win any of those in 21st century at least.
NC Dems, even statewide offices like governor, have had a base in rural, eastern NC for decades. Wall didn't seem to hold last night.
Current numbers indicating Cooper only polled 45.8% in Robeson. A county Daton won w/ 60.1% in a losing year. Wild if that holds.
2012 Dalton numbers by &gt;5%. Only one county outside of the east (Dalton's home county) did that badly compared to 2012.
Robeson, Gates, Columbus, Perquimams, Camden, Chowan, Bertie, Pasquotank, Hertford, Tyrrell, and Bladen all underperformed
All four Democratic losses in the #ncga were rural
My biggest takeaway from last night in #NCPol: rural Dems got whipped.
