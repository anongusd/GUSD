@sarahkendzior #DejaNews. Well said.
@marceelias Some people are *so* hungry for the "Dems divided" narrative.
Context matters, and I've seen zero so far from those covering it with live-tweets.
So, while it may be fun to dunk on the ridiculous things said and done by Wohl, Loomer, Walker, Gorka, Falwell Jr., Pence, et al., we need to view CPAC as a much deeper threat, fully intertwined with the GOP leadership.
This all goes hand-in-glove with both the violence of groups like Patriot Prayer and the Proud Boys, and the war-fetishism of administration folks like Bolton and Pompeo.		For them, violence and war are good in and of themselves.
The insistence by a range of CPAC speakers on racial purity, religious purity, and ideological purity, along with the spurious fear-mongering about "liberal" or "socialist" decadence and depravity, are hallmarks of fascist governments of the 20th century.
The alarming thing about CPAC isn't that individual speakers say outrageous things.		It's that CPAC as a whole is a crypto-fascist hate-fest, and members of the government, including the sitting VP, revel in it.

@Mikel_Jollett The Democrats have been the party if fiscal responsibility for *decades*, and it is time to capitalize on it.		Talking honestly and openly about how we fund progressive policies is a positive, and should not be seen as a rejection of a policy, per se.
@Mikel_Jollett Do such a treatment for a broad range of policies. Public school funding, green tech, infrastructure projects...		Each individual policy sounds great on its own, but we need to keep discussing how we pay for a *platform*, not just a policy.
@Mikel_Jollett I think it would be a great idea to come up with realistically priced policy *scenarios*. 		e.g. How much would completely free tuition cost?		How much would it cost to phase out the subsidy at various income thresholds? 		How much would it cost to subsidize to, say, 5k/yr? 10k?
I would like to see more discussion of reducing defense spending.
@MollyJongFast @SecNielsen Along with Stephen Miller.
Free college, debt-free college, and affordable college are distinctions that are worth making but not getting hung up on.

Periodic reminder that defense spending is absurdly high, and shouldn't be a third rail.		There are much more important things to fund, like education, infrastructure, and healthcare.
Certainly, companies should be able to use prior net operating losses to reduce their tax burden, even if it zeroes out.		But too often, the tax code gives companies such generous tax incentives that it actually amounts to an annual transfer from the treasury to private industry.
Personally, I don't believe that companies should be able to have a net tax benefit of money they haven't already paid in taxes previously.

One very good point that Rattner makes is that, absent the closing of loopholes, tax-avoidance strategies will tend to keep the effective rate relatively stable, no matter where you set the top marginal rate.		So although AOC's plan is backed up by research, it is not a panacea.
We should not choose between these three ideas. We should do them ALL.		Maybe that means the top rate is a little lower than @AOC has suggested, or the capital gains rate sees more modest increases, or the wealth tax is even lower than @SenWarren's proposal. And that's ok.
The important thing is not that we have a specific rate at a specific income threshold. The important thing is that we are collectively acknowledging that the rich are taxed far too little, and we are discussing openly how to fix it.
Steven Rattner proposes increasing the rates on long term capital gains and dividends instead of focusing on the top marginal rates on income.		As with Warren's tax on extreme wealth, I would point out that these are not mutually exclusive ideas.		https://t.co/0q0Hu96Db8

When we're all working so hard just to stay afloat it's hard to help others, and when we don't help each other and support each other, it is hard to build community.		And that is the plan: keep us divided and exhausted so we won't notice how rigged the system is.	#LetThemEatCake

@PatrickRuffini Zero social or financial returns? How can you quantify this? Or is it just your ideological bias leading you to make unfounded claims?

The US could cut its defense budget in half and still spend about three times as much as Russia and China combined.		But we can't afford to pay teachers a living wage, or to fix Flint's water, or to forgive Puerto Rico's debt.
Not only will we not give in to Trump's inane demand for a wall, we will demand the closing of all detention facilities.		We will demand investigations into claims of abuse and corruption.		And we will insist upon the humane processing of asylum claims, as required by the UNHCR.
The refugees at the border are not a crisis or a threat.		The true crisis and imminent threat is from Trump, his administration of extremists, and the utter lack of oversight ICE and CBP, which have essentially become white supremacist paramilitary organizations.
And if you are not disgusted and outraged enough by all of this, *of course* Trump and his cronies are profiteering off of the camps and detention centers. 	 https://t.co/iyVFD7nzDk

The only crisis on the border is a humanitarian one of Trump's own making.		Children are dying in prison camps, ripped away from their families, subject to sexual and physical abuse. Refugees are tear-gassed.	Prisoners are beaten to death.		And people connected to Trump profit.

@JRubinBlogger Stop rewarding their advertisers with your eyeballs and they'll stop booking them.		Just turn the shows off.
@Amy_Siskind Any idea that a candidate needs to fit a certain demographic to be viable is nonsense. 		We should all wholeheartedly support candidates that inspire us. And, no matter who we support, we should stay positive and not attack anybody in the primaries.
@KimStrassel So, you do some treasony stuff, the FBI shows up to ask about it, and you think, "I'm probably fine to lie here, right?"		That's the take?		That the person is correct and justified in lying to the FBI, unless they're warned explicitly not to lie?

@JessFurst It's not a "recount" if the votes are suppressed in the first place. It's just a count.		I would say that GOP committing wide-scale election fraud would be unthinkable, except it happened in North Carolina.
