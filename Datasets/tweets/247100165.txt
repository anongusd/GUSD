11,672 tweets call #ChristineBlasleyFord a liar. @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @Sen_JoeManchin &amp; @JeffFlake need to consider if they want to be siding with those who are calling Ford a liar. Is that the message they want to send to the country? #BelieveSurvivors #KavanaughVote
Over 40,000 tweets today use one of these hashtags: #StopKavanaugh #VoteNoOnKavanaugh #BelieveSurvivors #BelieveWomen #BelieveChristine

Looking at the tweets using the MAGA hashtag, we see at the center of these tweets the "God of #FakeNews" QANON. They always mention Trump with comparable frequency. #KavanaughVote #sociallistening https://t.co/214UAsR9CY
44,326 tweets use the hashtag #ConfirmKavanaugh (or some variation of it). The cloud reveals that these tweets are being driven by Trump's base (those using his MAGA and KAG hashtags). https://t.co/iqylfkR3Yr
We can learn a lot about the people who are pressuring @JeffFlake, @SenatorCollins, @Sen_JoeManchin and @lisamurkowski to vote for #Kavanaugh.
51,000+ of Tweets mentioning #ChristineBlaseyFord today exhibited negative sentiment. Here is the word cloud of those tweets. You can see that many of these tweets are pushing the narrative that Ford was pressured to lie and keeps changing her story. #BelieveSurvivors #Kavanaugh https://t.co/un6o9lPu6L
726 of the tweets mentioning #ChristineBlaseyFord are using the hashtag #ChristineBlaseyFordIsALiar. And we wonder why most women who survive sexual assault do not report it. #BelieveSurvivors #fem2 #sociallistening
Of the 121,013 Tweets we found mentioning #ChristineBlaseyFord, here is a word cloud of what people on Twitter are saying. https://t.co/lUfqR81cHf
Some things we are learning about the #KavanaughVote w/#sociallistening: So far today there have been 1.5 million tweets mentioning #Kavanaugh or one of the key Senators: @Sen_JoeManchin @JeffFlake @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski and also #ChristineBlaseyFord.		#BelieveSurvivors
