B2B and B2C trade shows bring great value to chambers. -@algmvaro #CHCC35
James Duran highly recommends @USHCC training, but emphasizes the power of your relationships. #CHCC35
Ernie Gutierrez finds certification is a "foot in the door". Our #CHCC35 workshops help you go from contacts to contracts.
#CA businesses need help with #marketing strategy, #procurement, and access to #capital. Can you fill any of those needs? #CHCC35
.@PGE4Me places a priority on hiring people who speak more than one language. -Monica Tell of @HCCAC #CHCC35
El español sí es importante: 69% of CA #Latinos said they operate in a dual language environment. #CHCC35
The future looks bright for the #Latino work force, with hiring picking up. Family is a great #networking resource. #CHCC35
#Oakland success story: @WellsFargo helped a #Latino produce company grow by $1 million in 1 year. -Micky Randhawa
