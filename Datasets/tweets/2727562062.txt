@TheStreet It is actually the right time to raise rates. Even though there is and will be global fallout. But maybe we should learn from the recent past and not stick to the one hard failed lesson. What is a realistic benchmark.
@TODAYshow @awkwafina @mariashriver You mean like the show Brooklyn nine nine where all the whites cops verbally disrespect all the minority police. And then treat them really nice physically and emotionally. That was not a directive right. But the whites conduct themselves collectively.
#threestrikes three strikes was intended for violent offenders? How are there non violent offenders serving life under three strikes? Nobody changed the law? These people have been kidnapped and deserve a large settlement. And the kidnappers who will claim incompetence go to jail
#threestrikes murder by illegal incarceration. The illegal modus operandi, has been proven. And there for genocide along with casualties of genocide to argue the point. A very Hitler plan.
#threestrikes if you say no prison for life.
@TheStreet That means my taxi cab company is prime real estate.
#threestrikes in other words if you defend yourself prison for life. If you have any kind of pride or respect, prison for life. We dont want the decision in the hands of biased judges. Equality.

@Millie__Weaver Think realistic not in the myths you heard all your life. The churches f as milly values are made clear. Rape, bastards, step dads, children before marriage, murder the list goes on and on. These are some of the founding values of christianity and Catholicism.

#America Leadership is a potent combination of strategy and character. But if you must be without one, be without the strategy.	- Norman Schwarzkopf I wonder if our dear chief and commander got this one wrong.
#judicialwatch you know what's funny is the judicial branches confidential informant program. These guys get to commit crimes like dealing drugs ect. For snitching on other people. The funny part is all they have to do is make something up, to ruin someone s life.those are rats..
@JudicialWatch @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Yes your right so how come he hasn't done so. Because theres good faith in Mullers investigation and Donald trump knows it.
@realDonaldTrump Why when they can just buy from africa 10x cheaper
@SGTreport Its unconstitutional and anti social media..??
@thehill Unless Donald trump doesn't have as many guests at his hotels as he says. Maybe some should look into that?? The guy seems shady not releasing his taxes and all.
@thehill So my math is wrong but you get the point everybody's government pensions should be = to social security that will make a dent.
@thehill Let's stake out planned purchases and Bill's and see what left to divide between the employees. Wow I didnt know army soldiers made 433 million a year.
#judicialwatch the Judicial branch stated that it operates in the best interest of the government. But I ask what specific government is that. Be wise the only thing in the best interest of this government is the constitution.
@WSJ Good thing i bought several tons when it was worthless...lol
@nytimes Ohh if its happening there its happening every where..!!!

Its amazing how if your not white and you vmcan make money all the white people around turn into those racist people from the movies. Like django. I go to a restaurant and the segregate the minorities that can make money. The stupid ones are welcome.
Economic genocide or otherwise. In other words if you are an itellectual minority and you want to make money, if white people cant control you or stop you, white people will kill you because you to many chromosomes than the religions of godism will allow. It's been proven.
And that intangible power is the freedoms granted to every citizen by our constitution.
@thehill This unsoverign sociapathical tyranny is not the definition of America. It's great to pretend we dont care bit this will not be done to one minority, because it will be done to every minority. Your not fighting for this instance, your fighting for every bit of intangible power

@FoxNews They should learn from white supremacy they kill for power, control and world dominance.

#judicialwatch obviously a judge or any member of the judicial branch or any member of a state agency that deals with minorities can not participate in any trial or charge if they are racist. So it is necessary to ask the question if they are racist and their answer in their file
@HillaryClinton Donald Trump hugs and kisses babies. Not democrats.

@FoxNews @johnrobertsFox Sorry but the only backlash is from the unamerican
@FoxNews @SenTedCruz No problem as long as it's not our tax dollars. Spend your own money Democrats.
@FoxNews @NYGovCuomo Nobody asked if it where up to me I would not want one illegal immigrant in America. Not one.
@MSNBC @MaddowBlog Democrates are crazy keep American criminals and their families together first. These Democrats want to spend your tax dollars on illegal immigrant children. Spend your own dam money and we will spend our tax money on America and Americans.

@7eleven Hilliarious movie about white cops targeting a child.
#judicialwatch I think that police officers should have baseball cards displaying stats accomplishments and awards.  Then they could really inspire children and be heroes. Instead of white supremacy goons.
@FoxNews Just ask for the police stats
@Fulcrum__News Arrest that guy or thing
@politico This is why everyone thinks your weak you cant stand by what you say. You remind everyone of a spoiled 3rd grader.

#WhiteSupremacy you can actually scientifically measure white supremacy activity around you based on your bank account if your a target.
@SGTreport I'm currently getting harrassed at work because I dont believe in christianity or white supremacy.
@Millie__Weaver Who said that
@FoxNews @TheRealJohnHCox White supremacy happened to rule of law, if it does not benefit white people not even the constitution can help it.
@FoxNews @kdeleon Donald trump is constantly raping humans with his mouth.
@FoxNews @robertjeffress Really because Facebook un published my religion p as he because it did not coincide with those delusional religions of godism.
@FoxNews @robertjeffress When people say that they are delusional, illuminati up
@FoxNews @kdeleon When any leader especially the one of the so called free world calls as my human an animal there is a problem with their worldly perception and morality. Then this individual has a group of media backtrackers yo say what he ment. It's almost funny, but it is reality

@JudicialWatch Sounds like the judicial branch is a bunch of con artist
I can prove it
#brotherhood most union electricians are secretly injuring the company they work for for example where I work all the spare parts disappeared right before harvest. And they are not ordering any right before harvest.
#brotherhood the electricians union is trying to control who becomes an electrician. The fact is if you take the course work I took as soon as you graduate your an electrician no union needed.
@FoxNews @GeraldoRivera To steal their identities for illegal immigrants
@politico #leakers freedom of speech if you it ain't classified it's free game..
#IllegalImmigrants why doesn't Congress offer voluntary deportation some perks some cash and see you..vs court and money etc..
#world the world sees Donald trump as weak
https://t.co/i209vhAqoo suspects not criminals? Why would it be cheaper to kill a suspect who is still innocent of any wrong doing? It would make more sense if your alleged suspect was your target. Then it would be cheaper.
#illuminati when some asks me how I'm doing these days I say better than bad
#electrician I'm in our electricians office yesterday and the three disrespectful white electricians, start talking about mushball then our supervisor gets up and leaves. And they stay real quiet for 5 minutes after he leaves. At the same time . Great code guys that's hostile
@politico #cia if you would like to know how they get a young man to commit these acts just ask the CIA they have a system to program susceptible aged people to do these acts. CIA 101

@Change @SenBooker @SenWarren #respectoflife how about dont tell the people of the state to not murder my unborn son act.
#deportation of the president of the United state would like me or the science and ethics intelligence agency to deport illegals all he has to do is ask. I will just ask them to leave.
Build the wall and report immigrants the school shooting was to give illegal immigrants illegal immigrant children the documents of the dead children. Think of the movie ready player one like a description of a business plan
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump No you referred to all undocumented immigrants as animals. Irish included where ever they maybe.
When your the only that ain't bluffing
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Deport them all pussy
#ourcountry is one where you can not write about white supremacy on faceface book, and the president who claims to want to deport illegals cannot because the illegals are bluffing him and he believes they are more powerful than him
@selenagomez Congress is selling the identities of the murdered in Texas to illegal immigrants that will come to the us and sell drugs for them. Just speculation of course.
Build the wall and deport immigrants the school shooting was to give illegal immigrants illegal immigrant children the documents of the dead children. Think of the movie ready player one like a description of a business plan

#justicialwatch the most ignorant and incompetent thing a judge can say is "in my court room". It's not your court room it's the tax payers court room or the governments court room.
#electrician from what I've seen it takes 15 to 25 yrs of experience as an electrician to learn what you learn at college in two too 4 yrs. Why would you hire the journeyman or pay the college student less
That's why is the common sense thing to have a union and teach people by trial and error instead of honoring college education.
The brother hood of electricians attempt to hold companies for ransom. In other words at last companies that I worked for as an electrician not making mistakes is frowned upon. An you will get fired for fixing things as an electrician. I guess that's the common sense thing todo

The only thing that will stop the stock market from going up is war
@TeamCavuto The president has done nothing but try to cause a war. Is this his only agenda
You Donald Trump can not cause a war no matter how hard you try. And further more the Democrats are loving your time in office they will have enough material to ensure that Republicans never take office agian. And last your own house speaker did you in..
Me and white supremacy dont get along...
@FoxNews @GovMurphy Why ? Deport them they are breaking the law
@latimes Here is the straight rights a gay guy would of never made a pass. So can straight men make z pass at a woman? Why did she not leave?
@FoxNews Why couldn't Trump do that?
Because me and snitches dont get along. If you get arrested and you think the officer did something wrong. Tell your lawyer you want an affirmative defense. They cannot deny you the right to defense. Above everything else.
@FoxNews @IngrahamAngle Equality is not what it was intended to be by the special interest group. Be careful what you wish for.
