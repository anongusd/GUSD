The fate of this "canary in the coal mine" bill, which is a net positive, will be interesting.

@CatScratchReadr Completely disagree. We’ve repeatedly been a great defense with scrubs at safety. Meanwhile, our QB can’t stay upright and we are near last in sacks.

#Climatechange solutions are a must, but proposals that are politically and economically impossible can actually do harm. Compromise, political savvy, and strategic messaging are vital. All-or-none is not the only option, and moderate approaches should not be cast aside.
Very well said @JasonGrumet , "Decarbonizing the economy over the next 30 years is necessary, difficult and achievable. Pretending that it is quick and easy only empowers the uncompromising hard-line elements within both political parties." #ClimateChange		https://t.co/LSRacBLrbG
