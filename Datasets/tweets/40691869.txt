@justinbieber Bro, I just read the CBN article on you and Hailey honoring the Lord in your relationship.  I commend you! God will honor you and has.  I’m praying for you both. Come to DC sometime.
@UCBearcat92 Honestly, it has nothing to do with the President.  The Bible says that heaven has boundaries, that nations have boundaries.  While I believe in boundaries, I also believe in compassion.  That is why I said we need both and.  I hope you understand where I’m coming from. Blessings
@UCBearcat92 I am a Christian and in favor of border security.  My personal opinion doesn’t reflect the opinion of the org.
@UCBearcat92 It’s a both and.  We need border agents, entry points, judges and barriers
@UCBearcat92 It is simple yes
@UCBearcat92 Israel my friend. Israel...
@UCBearcat92 My initial post that you commented on, was referring to the fact that we spend billions to keep sound out, but not to protect our border.  I brought up Israel because you said a border wall is pointless and won’t work.  I’m quite satisfied with my critical thinking.  Blessings
@UCBearcat92 You said that walls don’t work and are a waste of money.  I’m not referring to why Israel has a wall, as opposed to why we would here, but that it works. I responded to your previous clause and you’ve changed the framework again.  We were not talking about why, but if.  Blessings
@UCBearcat92 Have you ever been to Israel? I have been 10 times and I’ve walked on either side of the walls there.  They have worked for many years now.  Walls can work, but it’s not just a wall. It’s both and.
@UCBearcat92 Thank you for the kind words. Have a blessed day!
@UCBearcat92 Security, border judges, entry points and physical barriers.
@UCBearcat92 It’s not so much about them being the same or not.  It’s about the fact that we spend billions of dollars on sound wall on the interstates of America, but we don’t want to spend that on a wall at our border.  I believe that it’s not an either or, but a both and. We need more
@nwfamsp001 Was a lot of fun my friend!
@KOlusola @alfa_romeo @leigh_411 I almost bought one of those.  Love it bro!
@MaddyFatty @realDonaldTrump @RyanAFournier @charliekirk11 Appreciate the banter :)
@MaddyFatty @realDonaldTrump @RyanAFournier @charliekirk11 I think we can agree that America is worth protecting and that it is so important to work together to find a better future :)
@MaddyFatty @realDonaldTrump @RyanAFournier @charliekirk11 Which is why I’ve stated as well that we need better security, border agents, judges and a wall.  It’s not one or the other, it’s a both thing.  Finding a way to work together to make America safer.  I love how passionate you are my friend!
@MaddyFatty @realDonaldTrump @RyanAFournier @charliekirk11 Of course we should bring people together and come to a solution.  I’ve never said it’s just a wall that will fix the issue.  There are multiple components to it.  Also, allowing people who are here illegally to become citizens isn’t going to work.
@MaddyFatty @realDonaldTrump @RyanAFournier @charliekirk11 I think you’d find that I am willing to call out people on both sides of the aisle.  I do however believe that it is important that we protect our borders the best we know how and not let whoever wants to to come in join us.
@MaddyFatty @realDonaldTrump @RyanAFournier @charliekirk11 If you think it’s impractical, what do you supposed we do as a government to combat this issue specifically?
@MaddyFatty @realDonaldTrump @RyanAFournier @charliekirk11 It’s not that simple and I think you know that.
@MaddyFatty @realDonaldTrump @RyanAFournier @charliekirk11 Bottom line, is that we have an obligation to our nation to protect our citizens.   I certainly will get off my rear to try to find a solution and the good people who serve us in the Congress are trying to come to a joint plan.  We need to pray for them
@MaddyFatty @realDonaldTrump @RyanAFournier @charliekirk11 We are leaving the realm of just talking about border security and moving into the government shutdown.  I have my own opinions on that.  I was here for it and most of my friends and some of my family were touched by it.  The question I am asking is “is it immoral?”
@MaddyFatty @realDonaldTrump @RyanAFournier @charliekirk11 The point is that we as a nation spend and have spent billions on sounds walls and we value those.  Should we value the security of our actual borders though as well? I believe that we could use both added security and some extra walls.
@MaddyFatty @realDonaldTrump @RyanAFournier @charliekirk11 And homelessness.  Fiscal responsibility is so important.  Both parties are both guilty of lacking in that department.
@MaddyFatty @realDonaldTrump @RyanAFournier @charliekirk11 Israel’s wall is 440 miles long.  Yes, our border is longer.   No one is trying to debate that.  Adding border security and a wall at important points of the border to start isn’t a bad thing.  Like I said, both are valuable.  I don’t debate that we have major debt
@MaddyFatty @realDonaldTrump @RyanAFournier @charliekirk11 I literally just walked out of the office of a member of Congress who understands the value of both added security and border walls.  It’s not a one or the other thing, it’s both I believe.
@MaddyFatty @realDonaldTrump @RyanAFournier @charliekirk11 They have all agreed that the walls they built across the country have been vital to their national security.
@MaddyFatty @realDonaldTrump @RyanAFournier @charliekirk11 California spent over half a billion in two years on sound walls.  It’s not as much of a difference as you may think, when looking at the grand scope of the nation.  I’ve traveled to Israel for the last ten years, and I’ve talked to many governmental and IDF leaders.
I’m driving past this new sound barrier wall being built just outside of DC proper, in the Arlington area.  Funny, we can build a wall to protect local homes from undesired/illegal sound, but not to protect our borders. Interesting.. @realDonaldTrump @RyanAFournier @charliekirk11 https://t.co/UvVTw33xC2

@cjscalia Great read! Loved your father! He was always so kind to me.
@ThorstenBr @hopetothehill @AOC No matter our agreement or disagreement, we should always pray for them while engaging.  No one was making the point that we as the “people” are sub Servant to any government.
@ThorstenBr @hopetothehill @AOC Oxford dictionary states that “The group of people with the authority to govern a country or state; a particular ministry in office”.   I think the point that was being made was that these folks have been chosen by the American public to govern.
@joekennedy Great to see you last night.  Would love to stop by and say hello sometime.  Blessings.
@ThorstenBr @hopetothehill @AOC Government is in a place of authority over us.  While it is so very true that the government works for us, we have placed them in that position and it is truly important that we pray for them always.  1 Timothy 2-4.

So much fun filling in for Jason last weekend while he was sick.  Just like old times. I love… https://t.co/t0Cap30r0l
@LTdan85 @drmoore One, I am referring to his moral record and Two, he simply asked for clarification from scotus on the opinion given.  Yes, In a sense he was stalling, but was deep within his rights as a state Supreme Court Chief Justice to do so. His removal was in fact quixotic and unfounded.

@Bradymartin @DannyAkin @jackngraham @drmoore of course there is Brady! I love you my brother no less! It wasn't wise I don't think.
@Bradymartin @DannyAkin @jackngraham @drmoore about promoting a false religion.  I think the sbc has plenty to deal with already.
@Bradymartin @DannyAkin @jackngraham @drmoore I'm not saying the building couldn't be built, I'm saying that we need to be careful -
@Bradymartin @DannyAkin @jackngraham @drmoore Of course I do. I run a ministry in Washington DC that promotes religious liberty.
@Bradymartin @michealpardue @DannyAkin @jackngraham @drmoore I disagree with his statements.
@Bradymartin @michealpardue @DannyAkin @jackngraham @drmoore also, statements made about Christian leaders who supported trump
@Bradymartin @DannyAkin @jackngraham @drmoore Amicus brief. I think Dr. Haun was clear about his fear of aiding false religions.
@michealpardue @DannyAkin @jackngraham @drmoore I also just as Dr. graham is about the amicus brief
@michealpardue @DannyAkin @jackngraham @drmoore Dr. Moore has made statements about good Christian leaders whom I know
@michealpardue @DannyAkin @jackngraham @drmoore I doubt Dr. Graham would be that childish

@michealpardue @DannyAkin @jackngraham @drmoore Dr. Graham is a wonderful man who has real concerns that I would agree with.

God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our conscience, but shouts in our pains: it is His megaphone to rouse a deaf world. (Lewis)
God cannot give us a happiness and peace apart from Himself, because it is not there. There is no such thing. (C.S. Lewis) wow..
In life you must learn to let go and let God..Don't defend yourself. If you are in the right, He will.  Have faith in The things unseen..

Prayer and fasting are so important.  I've been practicing both of these things over the past few days.  Let God know you are serious..
At times we are hurt by the people we love most. At times we love those who could care less about us, Yet God loves us still. He is good 😊
Love..is not the way it is in fairy tales. When love meets life, it gets real and it takes work.  Love is an action, not just a feeling..

What a great day today! Sang in wv again! My second home!  Miss my ole buddies @ColtonPack_ and @DreWilliams
When peace like a river attends my way, when sorrow like sea billows roll Whatever my lot thou hath taught me to say it is well with my soul
Back and forth, day by day.  Changing minds and breaking hearts. Could we stay for just a while and learn to love like we were young again.
Among the greatest of achievements in life, one must be able to say that they truly loved someone selflessly.
Love can take the breath right out of your body.  Not sure if that's a good thing or not. Lol.
Absence makes the heart grow fonder is nt always the case.  Complacency sets in &amp; we can forget abt Our Savior &amp; the relationship He desires
First night run I've had in about 4 years.  Was a refreshing and beautiful reminder of Gods handiwork.  The heavens do declare the Glory.
Great seeing you @TellaGraham. Let's connect soon for lunch when you are coming through.
Africa, how I miss you... https://t.co/NWV0mh5S4N
Beauty made by our ashes, clean as if my heart had never been tainted so.  By grace I am made whole and through mercy's gate I am given rest
Have you ever loved someone so much that your heart hurt? Craziness!
Loving someone means showing that love on the bad days as well as the good days.  Love is work, it is patient, and kind.  Love is worth it.

@cole_beck03 hey cole!
People you care for the most are the ones who hurt you more than you could ever imagine.
I'm the distraction and perhaps the fool.
I love a girl and she is wonderful.  Nine months of awesome with her this week! Thank you for putting up with me @karlyehopper ☺️
I'm indifferent today.
I just want to do the right thing.  Help me Lord be strong and do what must be done.
Living in fear of what others may think is never the way to live.  Follow God and what He asks and never seek mans approval.
When one tells you they care about you then trash you to one who doesn't like you, it's hard to imagine that they could truly care. #truth
I am more than thrilled to have spent the last almost 9 months with a special young lady and I'm honored to have been her guy.
Never take people at what they say but at what they do. Words are mere tickling of your ears. Action is what you base ones opinion of you by

Have been reading about pain. Lewis says it best that God is the perfect doctor who is trying to fix you. Why would you ask Him to stop?
At times you work very hard for things and opportunities and people just use you. In those moments choose to keep loving and serving others.
In my grief and desperation I cry out to you oh God. In the night when no one hears me, you hear me in my weakness cry.
