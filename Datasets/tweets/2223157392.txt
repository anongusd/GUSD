Make that 6’ even. By 70, nearly all of us shrink. We don’t grow an inch! And read again Bornstein’s statement from the campaign. Which was not written by Bornstein. Ronny Jackson was obviously angling for a promotion. You can normalize Trump to your heart’s content.
So let’s focus on one more element. For his adult life, Trump listed himself as 6’2”. During the 2016 campaign, Dr. Bornstein magically made him 6’3” Which changed his BMI from “obese” to “overweight.” Ronny Jackson also said 6’3” Photo of Trump next to Obama: same height. 6’. 1 https://t.co/syMS9Zdx8j

RT @jonathanchait: Howard Schultz's own polling shows his campaign would reelect Trump https://t.co/UrtjNFraId
One last point. The outrage by partisans against one of their own is also somewhat selective. Calls for resignation occur more readily when the replacement is from the same party. Look at the contrast between Franken and Menendez. It is not all cynical. But it is not all pure!
Conservatives also know that their tribal media, from Fox to talk radio, will not go after one of their own. They did not attack Hyde-Smith, or do anything on the blackface of the Covington kids. But MSNBC and CNN will jump on the Dems who get caught in the death watch
None of this is to exculpate Northam; his cringeworthy press conference made the situation far worse for him. And even if the blackface incident he admitted to happened thirty years ago, it is not excusable. If blackface was common in the 1930s, it was anything but in the 80s.
Of course, there is another outcome from the Death Watch intense coverage. There is little opportunity to step back and assess things like context or to calibrate. When did offenses occur, what is the appropriate response; there is no waiting for more information to emerge
This can lead to tensions within the party, an ignominious departure of a major figure, and, just as important, less attention to other stories. Like thousands more children separated from families and an administration saying they can't or won't do a thing
..of Al Franken story, or that right-wing outlets broke the Northam tale. And they know that when something like this happens, it is more than likely that prominent Democrats will quickly condemn and make the story a death watch causing the intense coverage
So when King or Hyde-Smith or DeSantis- or Trump for that matter-- do not get a drumbeat from prominent Republicans to step down, the story disappears quickly. Democrats operate differently, and conservative activists know this too. No secret that Roger Stone had a role on timing
If there is a resignation they pivot to the next story. If there isn't going to be one, they lose interest.  Journalists also love internecine warfare, a party divided or attacking one of their own. Republicans know both of these things.
A few more reflections: journalists and their editors love a Death Watch story; when a public figure is being pressured to resign, they mobilize-crews and reporters swooping down on lawmakers and others to demand their views, a countdown to the end result.
This is both sad and outrageous. Trump apologists and sycophants Sen Ron Johnson and Jim Jordan go on the offensive to protect his corrupt acts. https://t.co/sa2MW2B2fx

@jbview It is conceivable that in 2021, even after taking the House, the Senate and the presidency, Democrats see the courts and the rules stacked against them. Meaning more elections where they could win majorities and lose &amp; have partisan courts stymie the laws they pass.
@kylelkennedy @jbview That is why changing filibuster rule is so enticing
@jbview I don’t discount damage or unforeseen consequences. But goals more urgent on political side than substantive. And even more true if SC says state initiatives can’t create congressional redistricting commissions, Rs promote more voter suppression, blow up campaign fin regimen
@jbview I don’t fully agree. Here are the things that push toward changing the rule: adding DC and Puerto Rico as states, enlarging the size of the Supreme Court and appeals courts to counter McConnell court packing. Campaign finance and redistricting reform. All huge issues for Dems

@jamesoliphant Electoral college has a more GOP tilt now, enabling an R candidate w minority support to win more easily than in ‘92. There will be a candidate squeezingDs as an indy or Green from the left. Schultz would potentially pull votes from suburban Repubs who don’t like Trump. Wi/PA/MI
A smart guy would know when consultants trying to get rich are blowing smoke at him. Mike Bloomberg is smart. Howard Schultz, not so much. https://t.co/C5USrHdy6u
@jamesoliphant Not about being a centrist. About running as an independent, trashing both parties equally, being a useful tool for Trump’s reelection. Jill Stein was not trashed for being a centrist. And she did not have Schultz’s billions (although she had plenty of rubles helping her.)

@GerardAraud @RahmDiaw @Amy_Siskind Also, a broader point: is it wise to have a dedicated, vicious adversary like Russia controlling so many jobs and critical materials?
@GerardAraud @RahmDiaw @Amy_Siskind I accept your premise. My question is whether you can see another way to punish Deripaska that would not cause this kind of damage to our allies
Another impact of a Schultz independent candidacy: it will almost certainly be accompanied by an independent running to the sharp left, whether Stein, Gabbard, Sanders or someone else. Dem nominee will be squeezed at both ends, to the benefit of Trump
@davidfrum Would be nice. But consider: no "elite" will choose a Democratic nominee; anyone running who adopts more radical positions will not be able to implement them; and most important,  Schultz either draws enough of those voters to turn PA/MI/WI to Trump or sends election to the House
@GerardAraud @RahmDiaw @Amy_Siskind Gerard, give me an alternative. Deripaska has been tied to Putin's actions that interfered in both our elections and, unsuccessfully to be sure, in Macron's. Is there another way to punish him?
You clearly have to watch more Fox &amp; Friends. That's where Trump gets nearly all his "information." https://t.co/S8ikIFHOfD
Trump’svtweets today show that he is trying to goad Howard Schultz into running as an independent. Why? Because he knows it gives him a better chance of winning reelection.
Trump takes all his cues from Fox and Friends.  If James and Lachlan Murdoch were at all decent, they would fill the show with reasonable people instead of the nutcases who are co-hosts. That alone could make Trump a slightly more normal president!
@RyanNewYork So presidential.
@aedwardslevy And “independent” does not mean independent. Two thirds of those who declare themselves as independent lean to one of the political parties and behave the same way as the clear partisans. Pure independents? About 10% of the electorate. Half of those are completely uninvolved
@KBAndersen @LisaBirnbach @SteveSchmidtSES Steve, please. The money is not worth it.
@ddale8 @jdawsey1 Well, to be fair, I cry whenever I think of Trump occupyng the Oval Office
@DavidJollyFL Here is the reality. If Schultz were successful by your definition, he would win enough electoral votes to throw the election into the House. Where they vote for president by state. 50 votes, a majority of Republicans regardless of overall House majority. Republican wins.

Every person working for Trump who has tried to justify this, and every Republican member of Congress who voted to reopen the government and then reversed themselves when Coulter spoke and Trump responded, is stained by this tragedy. Some genuine catastrophe is in the offing. 3
The numbers were much higher when the economy was bad. Most Americans do live paycheck to paycheck. Contract employees, many of whom work by the hour, may never get reimbursed. Medicines missed, houses foreclosed, people evicted, so many tragedies. All because Ann Coulter bleated
It makes my blood boil to see plutocrats like Wilbur Ross express bewilderment about the economic plight of federal workers. Fed surveys show that more than 40 percent of Americans, in a good economy, could not come up with $400 cash for an emergency. This is the sad reality 1

Here is a prediction, for what it is worth. Trump will hold a rally in a state where he is still relatively popular to give his State of the Union address. Probably WVA. Will count on all the television networks to cover it, which of course they will. Typical rally +attack Pelosi

@TheBudgetGuy Yes, he could. But as I mentioned in my responses to @MaraLiasson a speech in the tiny Senate chamber or even in the larger Capitol Visitors Center Auditorium would be a much lesser experience for Trump.
@MaraLiasson Either of those alternatives would make the president look smaller that he would in the traditional setting of the House chamber.
@MaraLiasson Of course, the Senate and its chamber are now Mitch McConnell's house. He can invited the president to speak. But it is a very small venue, with not many seats. Not what he would want. Or Mitch could invite him to speak in the larger auditorium in the Capitol Visitors Center. 2/
@MaraLiasson POTUS can call Congress back into session if it has adjourned. But the Capitol, esp the House chamber, belongs to the House. It is now Nancy's house. She does not have to invite him in. Of course, there is some peril if you look too calculating, but she is now on solid ground. 1/
