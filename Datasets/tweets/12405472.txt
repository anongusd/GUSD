@krissyssnow @jpgonzalezcruz @LilaGraceRose I think the cultural context, Biblical text, and traditional practice favor infant baptism, but I respect your position on the matter.
@krissyssnow @jpgonzalezcruz @LilaGraceRose On that note, I agree that baptism is not the part that saves you. Only confession, repentance, and faith can lead to that. But baptism is an invitation into the family of God and a promise that you will raise your children as Christians.
@krissyssnow @jpgonzalezcruz @LilaGraceRose I think part of the problem stems from a cultural misunderstanding. In the modern West we individualize everything. Read the OT mandates about circumcision – children, servants, etc. Households all together. It's about joining the family. In that context, re-read Acts.
@krissyssnow @jpgonzalezcruz @LilaGraceRose I understand your skepticism, I've been there and I've actually ended up on the baby-baptism side.		1) Acts 2:38-39; Acts 16:15, 31-33; 1 Corinthians 1:16 		2) Christian writers in the 2nd-3rd centuries mention baptism of infants as "traditional."

@matthewjdowd Real question, because I don't know: is COP a PAC or something with a specific agenda, or just a statement of solidarity amongst people who are frustrated with the party dogmas?
@mmmirele Like I said, I do believe in justice. But that's not the FIRST thing. The FIRST thing is reconciliation to God. The entire Bible makes that clear. Without that, true justice is impossible.
@mmmirele No, I haven't.
I do believe in justice, and that Christians ought to fight for justice, but "social justice" is not the FIRST goal of the Gospel – it's the reconciliation of sinful man to the loving God who created him.
“‘The most important one,’ answered Jesus, “is this: ‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.

@brian_louden @DrTomSchreiner @AJWTheology It's not about us forgetting or not forgetting sin. We can and should forgive our brothers and sisters. But accountability in leadership is about the integrity of the church in bringing the Gospel to the world.
@brian_louden @DrTomSchreiner @AJWTheology But it is truly humble for someone to admit their wrong, repent, and no longer seek a place of authority, instead accepting the leadership of someone else who can carry on the work with integrity.
@brian_louden @DrTomSchreiner @AJWTheology And I think it is actually FOR the sake of the Gospel that this is the case. Because when non-believers hear believers say "It's ok, he repented, so he can be a leader again," they don't see grace and humility. They see hypocrisy.
@brian_louden @DrTomSchreiner @AJWTheology There are other kinds of ministry where one can serve, humbly recognizing God's grace. That grace is for our salvation, not our elevation to positions of authority on Earth.
@brian_louden @DrTomSchreiner @AJWTheology One who steps down from leadership is not forever separated from good work. But it should be a different kind of work for the sake of the Gospel. 1 Cor 5:9–13 actually does tell us that we should use judgment in regard to those who claim to be brothers/sisters.
@brian_louden @DrTomSchreiner @AJWTheology The tweet is clearly aimed at sexual sin. There haven't been a lot of pastors publicly outed for degenerate gambling or gluttony. And 1 Timothy 3, which I referenced earlier, does lay out a pretty clear picture of what is expected of leaders' reputations and character.
@brian_louden @DrTomSchreiner @AJWTheology "…I would suggest none qualify." On what basis? Is every pastor committing adultery? Living in sin before salvation is one thing. After salvation is another. **While preaching the Gospel** is still another. It's not unforgivable, but yes it does disqualify you from leadership.
@WhitneyJael  https://t.co/NsM4VZ97ud
@brian_louden @DrTomSchreiner @AJWTheology Their sins are forgiven if their repentance is sincere, and they don't have to prove that to anyone. God is the judge of that. But salvation and leadership are not the same thing. You can be saved and forgiven without jumping back into leadership.

In English that's “The Spirit you received does not make you slaves, so that you live in fear again; rather, the Spirit you received brought about your adoption to sonship. And by him we cry, ‘Abba, Father.’”
It was in Greek, so it looked like this: Γιατί το Πνεύμα που σας έδωσε ο Θεός δεν εμπνέει φόβο για το Θεό ούτε κάνει τους ανθρώπους δούλους, αλλά παιδιά του Θεού. Αυτό το Πνεύμα μάς δίνει το θάρρος να λέμε το Θεό: «Αββά, Πατέρα μου!»

@RuthADouthitt @between2worlds *this case 😣
@RuthADouthitt @between2worlds Interesting, to be sure, but in the case I think the Christian perspective needs to take precedent over any other.
@RuthADouthitt @between2worlds Persecution from non-believers “on [Jesus’] account,” not from fellow believers on account of political or sociological differences. Suffering for its own sake is not the point.
@RuthADouthitt @between2worlds I think it's less about protecting people from difficulties and more about wrestling with what it really means to “love your neighbor as yourself.”
@BrianGMattson @joe_hollmann @between2worlds This, though: “…‘From every people and tribe, every nation and tongue, he has made us a kingdom of priests to God to reign with the Son.’ The camera swings past all the white faces just before I sing that line. This is the very definition of ‘painfully ironic.’”

@Jordan_Fadeaway @HelsMacBells @arthur_affect @lurkeylootoo @MsEveThomas @MarciaBelsky @HlywoodHeadless The tone of the poster matches the tone of the movie. That's basic marketing, man.
@Jordan_Fadeaway @HelsMacBells @arthur_affect @lurkeylootoo @MsEveThomas @MarciaBelsky @HlywoodHeadless You're the one who singled this poster out of the trend. We're just saying that it does, indeed, deserve to be included with the others.
@Jordan_Fadeaway @HelsMacBells @arthur_affect @lurkeylootoo @MsEveThomas @MarciaBelsky @HlywoodHeadless I agree that they don't have to. I'm just saying that if they don't then it's not a joke, it's intentional.
@Jordan_Fadeaway @HelsMacBells @arthur_affect @lurkeylootoo @MsEveThomas @MarciaBelsky @HlywoodHeadless "It's only being sexist ironically, so it doesn't count." Neither of the Kingsman movies try to call out sexist tropes. Which, whatever, I don't need them to. But only if they DID would the poster qualify as a joke or a rebuttal.

@Ameen_HGA If it's a problem of  "It doesn't affect me so I don't care"	then that's something we need to repent of.
@Ameen_HGA I appreciate that. I think we all need some.
@Ameen_HGA I'm not trying to dismiss the problem. I'm sorry if it seems so. I'm trying to relay some understanding from my perspective.
@Ameen_HGA All seriousness: not even my non-white friends &amp; family talk about racism to me. (Yes, even family.)
@Ameen_HGA But we have to be informed first, don't we? Who talks about it – personally – to white suburbanites like me?
@Ameen_HGA Maybe that's the problem. It's not something I encounter very often.
@Ameen_HGA Opposed, of course, but I'm talking about the level of outright battle we see today.
@Ameen_HGA What can I do in my life or my community to combat racism? I can respond when I see it (rare, but it happens), but what else?
@Ameen_HGA Here's a different question. Serious, because as a sister in Christ I ought to take your concerns seriously…
@Ameen_HGA Did the church actively fight against either until their advocates started pushing for legality, or just oppose them in general?
@Ameen_HGA I'm not saying racism isn't a real issue, just offering an explanation in answer to your question.
