Our revised policy guidance also increases the validity period of Form I-693 to 2 years, and is intended to reduce the chance that your form expires during the adjudication process.
Form I-693 can't be signed more than 60 days before you file your underlying immigration benefit application (such as Form I-485). For example, if you file an I-485 on May 31, 2019, your Form I-693 can't be dated any earlier than April 1, 2019.

As always, USCIS adjudicates all petitions fairly and lawfully on a case-by-case basis to determine if they meet all standards required under applicable law, policies, and regulations. Visit our website to learn more: https://t.co/eeCMgcIdPA
Ultimately, adjusting the premium processing fee will allow us to continue making necessary investments in staff and technology to provide more efficient adjudications and service for various immigration benefit requests. https://t.co/eeCMgcIdPA
Because premium processing fees have not been adjusted since 2010, our ability to improve the adjudications and service processes for all petitioners has been hindered as we‚Äôve experienced significantly higher demand for immigration benefits. https://t.co/eeCMgcIdPA
The premium processing fee is paid in addition to the base filing fee and any other applicable fees and cannot be waived. Visit our website to learn more: https://t.co/eeCMgcIdPA
Premium processing is an optional service that is currently authorized for certain petitioners filing a Form I-129 or Form I-140 seeking certain employment-based classifications.
USCIS is updating its premium processing fee on Oct. 1 to account for inflation. Read more on our website. https://t.co/eeCMgcIdPA

We will host a national stakeholder engagement regarding the revised policy memorandum on unlawful presence on August 23. https://t.co/Iyjp2tJOwh
The F, M, and J categories continue to have significantly higher overstay rates than other nonimmigrant visa categories supporting the need to address the calculation of unlawful presence for this population.
If the reinstatement application is denied, the accrual of unlawful presence resumes on the day after the denial. https://t.co/7DAWPZXSNI
Under the revised final policy memorandum, USCIS suspends the accrual of unlawful presence when the F or M nonimmigrant files a reinstatement application within the five month window and while the application is pending with USCIS.
On May 10, 2018, USCIS issued a policy memorandum changing the way we calculate unlawful presence for F, J, and M nonimmigrants who failed to maintain status.
We revised our policy memorandum on unlawful presence based on public feedback received during the comment period. https://t.co/7DAWPZXSNI

Proposed regulatory changes to the EB-5 program can be found by visiting: https://t.co/WpZYRYINpu
We are working to reform the EB-5 program, conducting regional center compliance reviews, and doing more site visits. We have terminated 179 noncompliant regional centers in approximately the last 17 months.

If the immigrant investor is guaranteed a return, or a rate of return on all or a portion of his or her capital, then the amount of any guaranteed return is not at risk. Visit our Policy Manual here: https://t.co/gKg5glHch9
Investors should know EB-5 program eligibility requirements. Capital must be at risk, and further deployment is only allowed in limited circumstances. Read the guidance here: https://t.co/gKg5glHch9
The law authorizes approximately 10,000 visas per year for EB-5 investors and their spouses and children. Currently, there are over 17,000 pending I-526 petitions, not counting spouses and children.
The EB-5 immigrant investor program, when created, was intended to stimulate the U.S. economy and create jobs. In 2007, there were 11 regional centers. Today, there are 908.

This memo does not change the RFE and NOID policies and practices that apply to the adjudication of DACA requests.
Due to preliminary injunctions, USCIS will continue to operate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy on the same terms and conditions in place prior to September 3, 2017.
By discouraging frivolous and placeholder filings and encouraging more complete applications, USCIS believes this policy may improve its ability to efficiently process applications and petitions.
This memo is intended to discourage frivolous or substantially incomplete filings and encourage applicants, petitioners, and requesters to be diligent in collecting and submitting required evidence.
This guidance restores full discretion to USCIS adjudicators to deny applications, petitions, and requests without first issuing a Request for Evidence (RFE) or Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID), when appropriate.

Dir. Cissna: ‚ÄúTo quote from a recent EB-5 tweet by Chairman Grassley: 'Americans expect INTEGRITY in their immigration system.'  I couldn‚Äôt agree more.‚Äù
Dir. Cissna: ‚ÄúOur duty to safeguard our Nation and the integrity of our immigration system applies equally to foreign investors and regional centers. ‚Äú
Dir. Cissna: ‚ÄúI want to assure this Committee that improving the EB-5 program is a very high priority for me and my agency.‚Äù
Dir. Cissna: ‚ÄúRestructuring the EB-5 program office at USCIS has led to better training of adjudications staff and significant improvement in identifying and resolving national security concerns.‚Äù
Dir. Cissna: ‚ÄúWe look out not only for potential terrorists but also potential spies, saboteurs, and technology thieves.‚Äù
Dir. Cissna: ‚ÄúWe are working more closely with our partners across the Intelligence Community too.  This helps us fill in gaps in law enforcement databases when we conduct national security vetting in the EB-5 program."
Dir. Cissna: ‚ÄúWe have also seen cases of fraud taint the program and undermine public trust.  Unscrupulous operators have preyed on foreign investors, and in turn, have harmed communities across the country that rely on these economic development dollars.‚Äù
Dir. Cissna: ‚Äú‚Ä¶there are indications that the [EB-5] program has been used to undermine our national security, with 19 cases of confirmed national security concerns in five years alone.‚Äù

Dir. Cissna: Every generation should determine for itself its own immigration priorities.
Dir. Cissna: In the temporary visa category, we will be taking action to protect American workers.
Dir. Cissna: Immigration doesn‚Äôt stop upon receiving a Green Card. You want people to become a citizen. Citizenship is in the name of my agency.
Dir. Cissna: We would not design an immigration system today like the one we currently have if we were starting from scratch.
Dir. Cissna: Random lotteries, extended family connections: that‚Äôs not the way to run an immigration system.
Dir. Cissna: The visa lottery program‚Äôs low eligibility criteria create unnecessary vulnerabilities.
Dir. Cissna: A 2003 @StateDept Inspector General report and 2007 @USGAO report warned that terrorists could exploit the diversity lottery program.
Dir. Cissna: Yesterday‚Äôs bombing suspect in NY came to this country through the most remote possible family connection - as the child of a sibling of a US citizen.
Dir. Cissna: One million immigrants receive Green Cards each year. In FY15, only 1 out of 15 received employment-based Green Cards.
Dir. Cissna: Our immigration system has three principal components: family-based, employment-based, and humanitarian programs.

H-1B stats: FY15: 20.5% RFE‚Äôd, 95.3% approved. FY16: 20.6% RFE‚Äôd, 93.5% approved. FY17: 21.2% RFE‚Äôd, 92.5% approved. (5/5)
Dir. Cissna: Increasing our confidence in who receives benefits is a hallmark of this administration and one of my personal priorities. (4/5)
Dir. Cissna: Sometimes we need to issue more than one RFE for a single petition to ensure we‚Äôre getting accurate jobs and wages data. Increasing RFEs can cause delays, but they provide assurance we‚Äôre approving petitions correctly. (3/5)
Dir: Cissna: With that in mind, RFEs have increased slightly, but not markedly, staying around 20% of cases. Meanwhile, our approval rate has remained above 90%. Increased RFEs reflect our commitment to protecting the integrity of the immigration system. (2/5)
Director Cissna‚Äôs statement about H-1B requests for evidence (RFEs): Let‚Äôs put the data in context. We calculate the frequency of issuing RFEs on the basis of how many petitions we‚Äôve completed, not on the total number of RFEs issued. (1/5)
