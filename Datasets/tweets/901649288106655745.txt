Life Span: Between 1940 and 2004, in the America, 'Smith' life expectancy was at its lowest point in 1944, and highest in 2002.  The average life  expectancy for 'Smith' in 1940 was 46, and 73 in 2004. @cindyhydesmith @RepAdamSmith
Similar surnames of 'Smiths' were, Smitha, Stith, Smythe, Nesmith, Smithey, Faith, Mitch, Smet, Smithe. These surnames are found New York.
Medieval 'Smiths' were important not only in making horseshoes,  plowshares, and other domestic articles, but above all for their skill in forging swords, other weapons, and armor. This is the most frequent  of all American surnames.
'Trump' family was also living in New York.
Occupational name for a worker in metal, from Middle English 'Smith' Metal-working was one of the earliest occupations for which specialist skills were required&amp;its importance ensured that this term,its equivalents were  the most widespread of all occupational  surnames in Europe
In 1840 there were 7,086 'Smith' families living in New York. This was about 20% of all the recorded 'Smith's in the America. New York had the highest population of 'Smith' families in 1840. @cindyhydesmith @ForrestCSmith
You can see how 'Smith' families moved over time by selecting different  census years. The 'Smith' family name was found in the America, UK, Canada, and Scotland between 1840 and 1920. The most Smith families were  found in the America in 1880. @cindyhydesmith @ForrestCSmith
In 1880, the most common 'Smith' occupation in the America was Farmer. 36% of  'Smith's were Farmers.  Farmer, Laborer and Keeping House were the top 3  reported jobs worked by 'Smith'.  A less common occupation for the 'Smith' family was Farm Laborer.
Draft Card:	There  are 1,000 military records available for the last name 'Smith'. For the  veterans among your 'Smith' ancestors, military collections provide  insights into where and when they served, and even physical  descriptions.
Passenger List:	There  are 642 Immigration records available for the last name 'Smith'.  Passenger lists are your ticket to knowing when your ancestors arrived  in the America, and how they made the journey - from the ship name to ports  of arrival and departure.
Census Record:	There  are 3,000 census records available for the last name 'Smith'. Like a  window into their day-to-day life, Smith census records can tell you where and how your ancestors worked, their level of education, veteran  status, and more. @cindyhydesmith
Schmidt is a common German occupational surname derived from the German word "Schmied" meaning "Blacksmith" and/or "metalworker". This surname is the German equivalent of "Smith" in the English-speaking world.
The name refers to a Smith, originally deriving from smið or smiþ, the Old English term meaning one who works in metal related to the word smitan, the Old English form of smite, which also meant strike ...as in early 17th century Biblical English: the verb "to smite" = to hit.
Many Whites are in poor or middle class positions, and majority 'Smiths' are Whites, exclusively in White parts.
