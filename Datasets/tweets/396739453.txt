@ProgressivePgh @mattbc See previous reply. You clearly need to educate yourself with respect to how a sustainable single payer system could/would be designed. If it was obvious or easy, we‚Äôd already be using it. I wish you well on your journey. My priorities lie elsewhere.
@ProgressivePgh @mattbc May I suggest you channel your rage into learning about the very complex issues associated with pharma. US model is unsustainable, clearly. Bring value to conversation with thoughtful suggestions, insightful observations, and genuine questions. As is, you are howling at the moon.
@ProgressivePgh @mattbc It‚Äôs true that almost all bona fide discovery has its genesis in largely taxpayer-funded research. It‚Äôs clear you are unfamiliar with the immense efforts required to validate discoveries and develop into an efficacious and safe drug. #Science
@ProgressivePgh @mattbc Tweet paints biopharm as a criminal. Your reply argues completely different point. US needs single payer system is the correct argument. Promoting hate toward an industry that we all rely upon for new and better drugs does nothing to solve the problem.
@mattbc @ProgressivePgh Consider value of housing, transportation, or entertainment and what consumers readily pay for these. What is the value of life saving drug to an otherwise lost life? I agree that system needs revision to trim the fat of middle men; but no compensation is absolute stupidity.
