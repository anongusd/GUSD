@zackbeauchamp @mattyglesias @eleanorbarkhorn @libbyanelson @amandataub the real tortilla coast was in our hearts all along
@eleanorbarkhorn @libbyanelson @amandataub I had a dream this weekend I was hanging out with OG vox crew and woke up so happy (and a little sad). Miss you guys
Shouts to our insightful, supportive and infinitely patient editors @meslackman @EricNagourney @rudoren @joshkellerjosh and especially greatest journalist of her generation @amandataub
You can also read my column for the tech section on the ideas and question that shaped our social media coverage. It’s pretty dark but at least includes a Terminator reference and a bluetooth headphone recommendation? https://t.co/ZmY5Biv4p2
@amandataub "Should We All Be Taking ‘Irony Poisoning’ More Seriously?”		Also from our newsletter, and I promise the last link, about the teens, vaping, pepe the frog, and what a German police detective thinks about them. https://t.co/5ZJdr2wotH https://t.co/yiPppCM6sy
@amandataub "Is social media distorting your sense of right-and-wrong?”		From our newsletter, which now reaches 235k+ subscribers, sometimes including both of my parents.  https://t.co/8bykBfKQ7E https://t.co/1YhrKPjLOp
@amandataub "On Social Media’s Fringes, Growing Extremism Targets Women”		We shouldn’t blame social media for violent misogynist groups like Incels, but they wouldn’t exist without it. https://t.co/iKCnUXtbJ7 https://t.co/kzsoq7FVdx
@amandataub "When Facebook Spread Hate, One Cop Tried Something Unusual”		A Bavarian cop showed that social media misinformation can be defeated — by taking it seriously. “Facebook, with its algorithm, influences people.” 	https://t.co/XDmNEVrIyb https://t.co/9FZZLsjFPW
@amandataub "As Germans Seek News, YouTube Delivers Far-Right Tirades”		So many stories of YouTube pushing users toward extremism, I’m glad we were able to document why that matters — because it really does.	https://t.co/f2e61KrdeR https://t.co/85SrQdbfth
@amandataub "Inside Facebook’s Secret Rulebook for Global Political Speech”		We’re just beginning to understand the power that Facebook wields over our politics, I suspect.	https://t.co/LYpfEMdNde https://t.co/2ZyWRMrJ6T
@amandataub "Facebook Fueled Anti-Refugee Attacks in Germany, New Research Suggests”		Showed how Facebook’s subtler effects – from the platform working exactly as intended – can scramble everyday users’ sense of right and wrong, leading to violence.	https://t.co/jSHzsN68IU https://t.co/eVzdKxDbfA
@amandataub "Where Countries Are Tinderboxes and Facebook Is a Match”		One of the stories of which I’m proudest, from this year or any other, on this topic or any other.	https://t.co/hrpBSMfb4t https://t.co/EBsu0vu33n
