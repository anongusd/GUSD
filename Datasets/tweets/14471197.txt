Fuchs: Editorial content will be a viable business for an extended period of time... How we present it is the question. Need to understand what’s happening in the market and adapt. Underlying value of the content will endure.
Someone asked “How can we help?” (Didn’t see who). Fuchs: Do good work. And when something is wrong tell us so we can fix it.
@MicahEscamilla He’s saying we’ve “right-sized”
.@mkalfus: Is anyone trying to buy us? Fuchs: Nothing is for sale and no negotiations going on.
Fuchs says he was surprised by Dean Singleton speech. Thought he got “carried away.”

CSB has sent 148 subpoena requests to ExxonMobil. 25% have not been responded to.
ExxonMobil has refused to answer CSB's questions and shows "stark unwillingness" to provide information, CSB says.
ExxonMobil employees weren't informed about issues or didn't heed their warnings about problems with equipment, CSB says
Some equipment that failed hadn't been repaired or inspected for 5 years. CSB says ExxonMobil was extending time between planned repairs.
CSB says flying debris is "near miss" by ExxonMobil's own definition. ExxonMobil contends it's not and won't comply w/ investigation
