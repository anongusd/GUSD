@VampireNox @thehill Congratulations. I've worked in healthcare for 20 yrs. I know Medicare vs. Medicaid, how they're each structured, funded, what's covered (&amp; what isn't), and who has oversight over each. Medicaid is much better. And Medicaid is already expanded (w/ buy-in options) in many states.
@bdicarlo1 @Rosie @thomaskaine5 I think you're referring to the House bill #HR1? It's a fantastic bill!  But you're right, I don't think that will pass the Senate. Mitch McConnell called it a power-grab or something like that (because eliminating barriers to voter access is apparently a bad thing).
@bdicarlo1 @Rosie @thomaskaine5 Thanks. I'm pretty familiar with the various gerrymandering cases. I live in NC, and our district maps have been in litigation off &amp; on for 10+ yrs. The problem is the maps are drawn by state legislatures, so the only federal oversight is in the courts (after the fact).

@bdicarlo1 @Rosie @thomaskaine5 I like Biden, but it deeply concerns me that he can so cavalierly refer to Pence as decent. As a straight white male, Biden has the luxury of not being at risk if Pence were ever at the helm. So many people want Trump impeached, but tbh I think Pence is even more dangerous.

@VampireNox @thehill Medicaid for all would be a far smoother transition. In fact, the two major "Medicare for All" bills are structured like Medicaid. Not at all like Medicare. And there's no overlap between FICA payroll taxes and Medicaid funding, so seniors won't lose their earned benefit.

@deveer_f @blanarph Just to clarify, they're not right-wing money. They're basically in the "Bernie wing" of the far left #fauxgressives. They're loosely connected with AOC and Justice 'Democrats' (a spinout PAC from Bernie's 2016 campaign, comprised mostly of Non-Dems). And they attack real Dems.

@LeviCurrie @midacre @Environment2022 @MikeHudema @JustinTrudeau I'm referring to the current trains and their current fuel cells. Do you know how they're made? That's a serious question.
@LeviCurrie @midacre @Environment2022 @MikeHudema @JustinTrudeau Do you have more information on how they're making the fuel cells for these trains? My understanding is that the standard method for generating industrial-use hydrogen is by steam methane reforming, because ectrolysis requires much more energy and is currently cost-prohibitive.
@TeslaSonic @kyanited @MikeHudema And depending on the extraction method, it can create CO2 and CO byproducts. They're really overselling this, imho. The train itself has clean emissions. But most of the current methods for producing hydrogen fuel cells are far from carbon neutral.
@LeviCurrie @midacre @Environment2022 @MikeHudema @JustinTrudeau Do you know how they're extracting the hydrogen to make the fuel cells? The most common method extracts hydrogen from natural gas, and that generates CO2 and CO byproducts. So even if you power the process using renewable energy, you still have to deal with the carbon emissions.

@Graceerskine4 @owillis "Back in the day" public school teachers never had to pay their own insurance premiums. The state covered all of it. States could still do that, if they actually bothered to make schools and teachers (and education in general) a priority.
@xdelmar59 @babyspittle @owillis Actually, many estimates show sigle-payer *could* save a significant amount on total health care costs.

@Theon_Orbis First this one I just started with a basic search for "Cusack". Then I saw some Tweets with "James Woods" and "Rob Lowe" and tried each of those to the "Cusack" search.		Pro tip: you can also do a semi advanced search manually, using Boolean search terms.	https://t.co/Gbp2BtTJiN
@tamarabrock Sounds good!! Imagine what we could do with $25+ billion! (est. total cost of wall -- not incl. ongoing maintenance in perpetuity!).		One thing that I really think we should be discussing is how to set up a *permanent* system for funding (e.g., payroll tax comparable to FICA).

@ccharette56 @SnowBiAuthor Then the next decision is what kind of taxes. These are important things to figure out.
