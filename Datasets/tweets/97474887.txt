I suppose you missed "good speech." I'm not judging. Just an observation since the shooting  happened in her state. https://t.co/gHcJw3baDH
@chuck2057 She's announcing for President.  It's not unreasonable to ask that it happen in her kickoff speech.
Good speech, but missed opportunity by @SenAmyKlobuchar. She didn't mention the shooting of Philando Castille, the Black man shot and killed during a traffic stop in St. Paul, MN, Mentioning the case would have signaled to AfAms, the base of the party, that she sees them.
