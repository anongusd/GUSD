@Stonekettle Take me back to 1975 on the 4th of July when I sat on the steps of the capital building and watched fireworks blast off in the sky...  I think trump is a few decades or centuries behind the time...
@funder They were there to collect their Russian Lottery winnings...
@Stop_Trump20 I feel like that every time I see him on TV... I can't imagine how bad it would be in person...
@_ReaalAmerican_ @kaitlancollins Who said phone calls??? 🤔🤔🤔🤔

@krassenstein Oh but only for about 700 plus days... and what he doesn't do in this list he makes up for in blatant lying to the people he is supposed to represent... Not putin the American people... thought I should clarify...
@BarneysNose @Stop_Trump20 forgot... I was laughing...

@BarneysNose He slid just like I thought he would... and trump and the trumpkins will too...
@Amy_Siskind He slid by just like trump and the trumpkins will do..
@GeorgeTakei @PollyPapaya I knew he would slide... you and I would be hauled away in irons, be locked up and the key thrown away... It goes back to the "It's not what you know it's who you know"

@TheCarter_Show @JimCarrey Possible??? LOL
@funder I'm sad we have to wait so long... but it might be like Christmas morning ...
@thomaskaine5 @LindseyGrahamSC @HouseGOP @SenateGOP Yep and I think their financials would reflect that ever idea
@UROCKlive1 I can't sleep... I just hope the Mueller Avalanche happens tomorrow... and stone gets locked up too...
@trcfwtt I think I'm going to as well... I bought Comey's book for the same reason...
@BarneysNose Charlie Brown???
@BarneysNose I think you are right...
@maydaymindy9 @PattyLehner Oh that would be the best scenario I could think of...
@SaysHummingbird @IAmJoeTrudeau May have??? Seriously you think "may have"??? LOL
@IAmJoeTrudeau @realDonaldTrump He already got it... as did Jared... and if he hadn't MBS would have sent a guy to make him pay up...
@realDonaldTrump Doesn't look completed...
@BarneysNose Move over...
@BarneysNose https://t.co/r45BIbVcVV
@tastipes @TheCenteredEgg Yep... one of those surprises... 😮😮😮😮
@bannerite @PrincessBravato @SenateGOP @HouseGOP Yup they are afraid to be next... they are  afraid they will get grabbed by trump... and we all know where...
@DrDenaGrayson @PrincessBravato @Trump @realDonaldTrump I don't think with the secrecy behind his physical that he will be alive by then...
@B52Malmet @LindseyGrahamSC  needs to clean up that potty mouth... screaming and yelling doesn't suite him like it does our inferior in chief...
@CillizzaCNN @brennawilliams Chris... you need to pass your coffee this way... LOL
@TheCenteredEgg Not sure @CoryBooker isn't going to be a force to be seconded with...
@treasonstickers I'm just disappointed that we won't see the judge drop the gavel and him being led away in chains... okay cuffs but I can dream...

@TheCenteredEgg He's gonna have quite a few surprises when he gets there...
@_NotFakeNews_ I think he carries too much baggage with him... but on the upside he did comb his hair for his debut yesterday...
@NicolleDWallace trump has done what putin wanted him to. he has sold out America and will keep doing this as long as the @GOP is on the take as well...
@BarneysNose Gonna boycott products that sponsor them as well... unless it's coffee... coffee will get a pass LOL just kidding my coffee is from a local shop... ☕️☕️☕️☕️
@CoryBooker @BetsyGervasi I like the idea I just have a question about how would someone pay for higher education in 18 yrs with the estimated $46,000 when that only pays for barely 2 yrs now. Harris has walked back her ideas and Amy seems pretty abrupt so you are up dude don't fail me now
@westernmainecc @TeaPainUSA I did too... hilarious... very true though...
@krassenstein I think I kinda knew that might happen... But we can all hope...
@SenatorCollins A little late... you have voted for trump and his appointees and anything else trump. Your word really doesn't carry much weight...
@Amy_Siskind Are those who would have the power to stop this walking waist deep in molasses
@TeaPainUSA Hard to remember back to "Normal" ...
@TheRickWilson Good one...
@thedailybeast Will not be watching @CNN ever again and will boycott sponsors...
@ddale8 Seems the NYT has struck a nerve...
@sahilkapur @nytimes He doth protest too loudly again...
@DSmith2120 @EliLake @joshrogin @LindseyGrahamSC That's possible...
@EliLake @joshrogin @LindseyGrahamSC Wow... I'm beginning to think there is more that a P P tape Putin has tucked away about Good Ol' Lindsey...
@phantom4203 @thedailybeast beyond pretty sickening... So happy I don't have a grandson like that...
@CoreyAtkins4163 @TheRickWilson @CNN @BarackObama Ya'all need to stop with the "What aboutisms"... We are not talking about healthcare we are talking about if trump or his minions have committed felonies...
@TheRickyDavila @NonnaFayRocks @VP Which ultimately means chosen by Putin... There needs to be an audit of Pence and Mother... financials, and every more in-depth than the one they had before he took office...  I could tell by the look of him that he wasn't honest...
@CoreyAtkins4163 @TheRickWilson @CNN Nope Nixon took longer than that... and if not... it ain't over til it's over... It's like baking bread... it takes longer for different types of bread... Would you like another analogy??? I have more of them...

@phantom4203 @thedailybeast Ya but trump is against the WAPO and Bezos so they are sucking up...
@treasonstickers They exponentially increase daily and sometimes hourly...
@BarneysNose https://t.co/fjltnpozyf
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump It really is blasphemy to use trump and Ronald Reagan in the same sentence and even worse to think they compare in any way what so ever...

@thedailybeast Kid definitely is studying to be a trump kind of president...
@suzan5150 @PalmerReport Oh I agree they are working overtime... but whether they will get the Senate to kick him out is another  thing... It's just a discouraging day... publicly and personally...
@thedailybeast Who is paying @CNN to ...???
@PalmerReport @suzan5150 No one will do anything about though...
@jimsciutto @Kathatestrump Another trumpian that will slide through no matter how must they break the laws...
@GOP @realDonaldTrump And what about @fred_guttenberg he deserves to have an end put to hand gun rights that infringe on those of us who want to live's rights... And that was a native from our country...
@samstein Hum... Really??? Nah... couldn't be... https://t.co/VZUDagUu1n
@burlphyl @DearAuntCrabby @dc_tribune I want it to make a difference but do you really think he won't slide through like he has all his life??? You and I would have already been locked away and the key at the bottom of the deep blue sea...
@PalmerReport I love days like this... LOL
@RealMuckmaker DUH... Seriously that is a question we already know the answer to... too bad that the @GOP weren't also under the power of Putin so they would put a stop to it...
@RWPUSA @DearAuntCrabby What do you want to bet that he slides right by just like his buddy trump???

@PattyLehner I will not dye my hair a funny yellow orange though... and I'll keep my Native American skin tone make up too...
@TheRickyDavila My line on the Bernie subject will always be... 		1) He brings too much baggage to the race		2) He doesn't comb his hair...
@BarneysNose @DonaldJTrumpJr but then anyone with connections to that family are not held accountable for anything they say or do...
@KeepINitReal604 @AngrierWHStaff Seriously??? https://t.co/3Aed0pHvLy
@PattyLehner I'm going to do that too... I think you and I should share the honor if they even remotely think of this... I can't believe he coerced Japan into nominating him...
@TheCenteredEgg He carries too much baggage... but he did comb his hair for his interview this morning... but doesn't give him a vote from me...
@PalmerReport But... but... he combed his wild hair down... he carries too much baggage to run... and he's too old... time for him to go fishing...
@treasonstickers At least I hope so...
@realDonaldTrump There is a tweet somewhere... for every statement that contradicts this...
@rot_grad Moin... 🌺🌺🌺🌺
@lc_renmom @B52Malmet Oh I agree... he has more power behind the scenes that we will know... unless someone steps up and leaks it...
@MSNBC LOCK HIM UP!!! LOCK HIM UP!!! LOCK HIM UP!!!	LOCK HIM UP!!! LOCK HIM UP!!! LOCK HIM UP!!!	LOCK HIM UP!!! LOCK HIM UP!!! LOCK HIM UP!!!
@AdamParkhomenko @Doyouhaveaflag I believe some of his statements but there are parts that he seems to be acting so make his story sound worse than it is.I'm concerned that he is also selling books. I understand that being fired 2 days before he got his retirement. So part of me hopes it a 2 million seller
@krassenstein Oh I think a couple million bail... 		Stupid Games ~ Stupid Prizes
@Rosie I believe that... I'm leery of some of the other statements he made in his book...
@tobyveach @TheRickWilson I agree...
@JenniferDewey1 @ellievan65 @shossy2 I agree... I trust the intelligence community as well... though we should not blindly follow those who are making a buck... I bought Comey's book and probably buy McCabe's as well... just not sure of them...
@SethAbramson Yup only as long as it takes to read the line...
@JenniferDewey1 @ellievan65 @shossy2 I don't trust anyone in government right now... we aren't being over dramatic... we have too much at stake for our future...
@treasonstickers We'd be starting a GoFundMe for bail...
@JenniferDewey1 @ellievan65 @shossy2 Yes... anyone that has been singled out by trump I think needs to be revisited. I'm leery of those that have written books. I worked for the FBI and I would never have written a book.
@JenniferDewey1 @ellievan65 @shossy2 I forgot about that but go after trump not the other people that are on the chopping block as well...
@ellievan65 @shossy2 I thought he was credible until he started shilling his book...
@Amy_Siskind It's already out there... "Card laid is a card played"...
@CatSkoor I'm guessing too stoned to seal his dentures properly...
@realAliTweets @GOP Putin has them all by the "short hairs"...
@mommamia1217 @Bornabrit1 Some things sound legit but others I'm doubtful...
@TeaPainUSA @PrincessBravato Neither
@BarneysNose I never live near the cool kids...
@funder That would play into his "oh poor me everyone is out to get me" ... but she won't take garbage so he might get this.. I'd laugh...
@BarneysNose https://t.co/5ud6w8foIa
@jonswaine Oh no... this guy needs to be put in custody until his trial... he is beyond nuts...
@TheRickWilson Darn I missed it... when did he threaten someone??? or did he say someone threatened him???
@krassenstein I think retribution is surely the evidence that trump is beyond unhinged... well and the little song of supreme court...
@ReneeLibby2 Oh so true... https://t.co/Y3rPBuAS6E
@TheCenteredEgg Or the president... they always seem so cozy and Pence is subservient in the kinky kind of way... https://t.co/C81gpCe5id

@MessianicX_777 @BarneysNose You can't make this stuff up even with the strange sense of humor I have... so I just wing it... I am writing a book about him... gotta be fiction... he's a fake...
@WiseWarrior69 I think he kicked himself in the "slats"
@JaniceClaire14 @funder @GinaMarie1952 I think he was threatened that's why he stopped cooperating with Mueller team... but if he told them enough my money is on your scenario...

@politvidchannel The world may be coming to an end... I agree with Ann...
@funder Can I administer the duct tape please???
@Deborah2180 @jennylinyoga It probably isn't much consultation but I'm praying from Southern Oregon that no one is critical. That there is some way this can be stopped so no one experiences this anxiety and pain again.
@BarneysNose No... cuz I'm holding my German bible and praying in German just in case... Her and her freaky dad. I think "Bob" should have a bus pull up in front the the WH and perp walk all of them then show up at Mar a logo. That would make my weekend.
I wonder how many #FakeTrumpEmergency 's we have today... The trump game is in play... I hope this is how he ends...
@JillWineBanks There is hope then??? I have been discouraged that no one or nothing could stop him. He is a detriment to society...

@DogginTrump I'm working on my 3rd pot... I can only hope that before 5 pm EST trump and all of his minions join Manafort in the "Suite"...
@DogginTrump 4 oz of coffee and 12 oz of Bailey's... that should be about right for the turmoil this nation has been put in by Putin's puppet and the paid off puppets in the @GOP
@Kris_Sacrebleu He is a spoiled out of control brat and @GOP are the parents who don't stop him. They enable him to throw temper tantrums then stand back while he trashes our country... because they are all being bought off or there is something in the safe from "Pecker Gate"

@peterdaou Full back ground check and top secret security, financial audit, and who their friends are and who they associate with. We also need to have past presidents step up and say what is wrong instead of sitting back and letting the country they are supposed to love go to hell.

@LindseyGrahamSC You do know that John (your so called good friend) is looking down on your and shaking his head... what a disappointment when I thought you were a smart person...
@KamalaHarris The budget should be turned over to my daughter in law... the budget would be balanced and trump would not be given any money for such garbage...
@BarneysNose And there should be a "Straight Jacket" one as well...
@BarneysNose I deserve it before he does... and I've needed bail at least 7 times since he's been president... Have to defend myself when I disagree with a trump minion

@TheRickWilson OMGeezz... I just saw you on tv last night and you must have had a really big meal afterward... LOL
@BarneysNose I think it's funny that they are saying the @AOC  is the reason the deal fell through. They are giving her more power than she has (so far) as a young representative. I give her much credit though. I wish her well and that she goes far... https://t.co/fjOgWdYNnR

@amyklobuchar @A_Big_Hell_NO Well I saw your snow-speech and though I was leaning to Harris after her radio gig I have decided that you are the better choice... Don't let us down now... We're pressuring you LOL
@LuBonLez @CyrusMMcQueen I have said that for years about my phone/CB radio. Case~ as a truck drvr someone said I was a "Whore" because I was talking to a man who was black. hence the radio thing. I may see color but I don't judge someone by their color. Dad said any color man can be crooked.
@marcorubio Sooooo... then God blessed trump three times... not including his concubines??
@MaddowBlog He can't be wearing so many layers of clothes that he is hiding a 6'2" and 239 lb man... trump can't even compete https://t.co/PBPmiGddki
@chrislhayes Hut two, three, four 	Mexico was going to pay for the wall	Hut two, three, four 	Mexico was going to pay for the wall	Hut two, three, four 	Mexico was going to pay for the wall	Hut two, three, four 	Mex i co was going to,,,, 	PAY FOR THE WALL 		Cadence for marching at the wall
@krassenstein He lies so much he and trump if you threw them both in a gunny sack and shook them up... I don't know which one will fall out first...
@MarciaDaughtre1 @SafiMaasai @trcfwtt @samstein And that's just breakfast... lunch and dinner consist of 3 or 4 double cheese burders each meal... then a few more at bedtime just in case... and let's not forget the McShakes...
@peterdaou They are trying to keep their secrets from come out of the safe from "Pecker Gate"
@TeahCartel @hazydav @GOP @FBI The GOP are all involved in "Pecker Gate"... they all have something to hide... tapes, video, financial inconsistencies... the don't care what they are doing to their family's futures either...

@mschlapp If he hasn't read up on the case and been fully briefed about everything that is required then he doesn't need to be there either...
@DWPippy @ReneeLibby2 I heard she does as well...
@TheRickWilson @Lawrence I hope we can focus on this as well... 		https://t.co/NorjubbQzD
@Stop_Trump20 This is a national emergency... this is getting to be a multi daily event... 		https://t.co/g38HXJHV6W
@suzan5150 https://t.co/g38HXJHV6W
@suzan5150 Seriously??? OMG if so we were just talking about this...
@suzan5150 @SenFeinstein that didn't make me feel better. I say prayers every day for all the kids and even adults that are in danger... which could be anywhere you go.
@suzan5150 @SenFeinstein That is horrible I don't know how you handle this. I have a 10 yr old who has drills so I don't feel secure in this either... my other grand daughter is in private school and an armed man ran through their school as well. My son a cop in uniform gave chase and arrested him but..
@WhiteHouse @PressSec This is a national emergency Sarah... what if this were one of your kids... https://t.co/NorjubbQzD
@TravisAllen02 This is a true national emergency... if you don't at least tear up reading this... you like trump have no heart... https://t.co/NorjubbQzD
@Acosta 6'2"... 239 lb man... I don't think this would be mistaken as our president https://t.co/6xKuxzcSJy
@waltshaub Will anyone ever step up and put a stop to the conflict of interest placements of so many of his admin??? Pathetic that those we elected to serve us and our needs are sitting on their thumbs
@MtnManMT6 I wouldn't let him near my daughter even though she is 40 and definitely not around my grand daughters. He is such a sleaze... I still remember the scandal of him raping and paying off the 13 yr old girl and paying off her parents. They elected him anyway
@BarneysNose I told Amazon and teddy bear was more faithful (On Amazon $19.99 free shipping on eligible orders) but they didn't listen... https://t.co/4EhIOqFcOU

@PrincessBravato Oh I'm for this as well...
@ewarren This one trump's them all.. if you can read this without tears you must be related to trump		https://t.co/NorjubbQzD
@funder This trumps trump		https://t.co/NorjubbQzD
@SenFeinstein @suzan5150 This is a true national emergency... My children never had to worry about this kind of terror... 		https://t.co/NorjubbQzD
@CillizzaCNN Then @senatemajldr needs to step up and round up the team and do something about trump. they allowed this to happen they need to clean up their mess...
@Kokomothegreat That makes a big difference on the med... but he still is not less than 350 lbs...
@JeffFlake You should have thought about this...

@trcfwtt @samstein Wow he shrank 2 inches and gained 100 lbs... that's not good... gonna have to cut the cheeseburgers, return the video golf (I know that isn't what it really is called), lose the diet coke, OMG and EAT A SALAD FOR GOD SAKE!!!!!
@AHepburn100 @SabineWilson18 @funder Oh I'm not comparing him at all... Russell is the 6'2" 239  lb example... LOL
@ItsMeCathi This was February 2017
@ahal79 @mkraju Yes it should...
@ahal79 @mkraju they better... that's where we will get screwed again... and not even get a kiss...
@waltshaub @TheRickWilson I'm stuck in Folsom prison 	And time keeps draggin' on	But that train keeps a-rollin'	On down to San Antone
@BarneysNose I'm still seeing your profile but then I'm already following you. I think if you were in trouble they would send you a message like they did me... made me put in a code to get back on line here
@BarneysNose I went back to you page and looked at the cartoons I don't see a disclaimer... but your's aren't bad... I think they are in good taste...
@BarneysNose I didn't notice I was too busy laughing LOL Did you get threatened with Twitter Prison??? You bad boy... https://t.co/730aFzs9SJ
@_ReaalAmerican_ @TeaPainUSA And everyone on Capital Hill should have to pass a top secret security clearance (again if they already had one) and a financial audit and not by a government agency and have to release their tax returns no matter what side of the aisle. Also what lobbyists they are in bed with
@BarneysNose I was thinking that he had to do an about face to save him and his family from other foreign actors... who know if someone could get a bone saw in his cell...

@BarneysNose eh... don't ya know...
@BarneysNose In my study of WWII and the downfall of Germany they didn't like us there at first because they couldn't have weapons/army then when we became a force to keep them from being taken over by Russia they were more acceptable I hope they like us I'm going to study there for 4 yrs
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Donnie... first of all no one wants to anoint anyone for life... that is why we have a democracy. Your father hasn't worked as hard as he thinks he has. You need to learn to not be his parrot. It won't do well in prison if he throws you under the bus. You know he will not Ivanka
@_ReaalAmerican_ @GOP @SenatorRisch I'm waiting with the pop corn machine ready... this will be good...
@JillWineBanks Can they subpoena Mueller and under oath ask him what he knows??? Don't know where I read that at. Probably on here by one of the many armchair attorneys that post LOL
@BarneysNose Thoughts and Prayers to you and your t-shirt. 		Question? Do the Germans hate us and want us and our bases out of their country?? Got into a heated discussion about this today. I'm a German student and study about Germany as well. I have never come across this sentiment
@JohnCap62494916 @Lawrence @CoryBooker @maddow As my granddaughter would say "Ooggie Boogie" for both I go to a local beanry that I have gone to for 30 yrs. love their coffee and their motto is 		Be Better Not Bitter 		LOL I think this guy is like his coffee and his running for president will bring another circus to town
@ABCPolitics Ya know he sure does rock back and forth a lot... unless he's got music running through what little mind he has... he might need another physical... with a real doctor this time...
@mkraju Nah... couldn't have he's a trumpian he is honest... 😜😜😜😜🙄🙄🙄🙄 as trump https://t.co/5Nx5rcgcQm
@TheBeatWithAri @AriMelber She has become a waste of space...
@NicolleDWallace It takes those in power to stop this... we can all jump up and down... scream to the highest mountain the horrid way these kids are being treated and those all over the world but it "Takes Those In Power"
@TheBeatWithAri @AriMelber Stupid Games ~ Stupid Prizes...
@JohnCap62494916 @Lawrence @CoryBooker @maddow He's a sleaze... and his coffee sucks as well...
@johnlundin His family sent him a special jacket that allows him to hug himself... then they medicated him and took him back to the home...
@suzan5150 @funder @ericswalwell Ditto... We don't... while the CEO's etc make millions per year and millions in other monetary benefits... I guess it takes a lot to keep up their sprawling palatial estates with the olympic pools, 18 hole golf course, and let;s not forget their private jets
@LindaTpa @TheRickWilson Music to my ears...
@BarneysNose DUH!!! MO... my eyes are blurry from seeing the retina specialist today...
@BarneysNose Stupid Games ~ Stupid Prizes... 		Sadly I don't have much sympathy... I wouldn't have taken a life but who knows what he did (was he in AR??? There was one down the road from me when I lived there) to deserve it
@SafiMaasai @dylanmsmitty I don't either...
@suzan5150 @dylanmsmitty Ya me too and now when my son starts in on planned parenthood (which gave me my health care when pregnant with him) and how evil it is... he doesn't listen to the fact that he might not have been born since he was 11 lbs 14 oz... we would both not be here
@PrincessBravato I don't think I could shake my head on that comment enough without getting a concussion... What is the matter with these people... I was born and lived longer than most of these  people... so		SERIOUSLY??? what is the matter with these  people... I don't think we can ask too much
@KateKizer @StateDRL They believe they are above scrutiny of their actions even back then... So little respect for these people when I am 62 and have always had to own up to my mistakes and didn't lie to get out of it or cover it up...
@dylanmsmitty I gave up a long time ago... even though I have two kids who are followers... I don't know what I did wrong...
@TruthChanges It really does scare me that those who believe this garbage from and about trump really do vote but worse yet they probably drive on our roads as well...
@JerryBojo @KampferFisher @SabineWilson18 @funder https://t.co/bz0HST6bQr
@antitrumpresist @B52Malmet Mueller won't be in contempt or be bought off by trump...
@antitrumpresist @B52Malmet I'll go with that...
@B52Malmet House Intelligence Committee will subpoena Mueller and he will have to answer questions from the report...
@JerryBojo @KampferFisher @SabineWilson18 @funder Oh I think I'd like a pound of gold as well... still 16 oz = 1 lb... I do believe that a lb of feathers would make a great pillow... lb of gold might be fun to spend...
@RealMuckmaker I'll try to be a lady so I'll just say he was just told what happens to people like him in prison...
@sherijr @joncoopertweets I'd have to see the invoice and the paid receipt to believe he paid for it...
@CMGattuso @joncoopertweets I think I will call them too... we all need to hit up the heads of the committee so they really know it isn't just them... These committees are really gonna earn their money with trump's antics...
@socal_american @joncoopertweets And who paid for it??? Let me guess... 🤔🤔🤔🤔
@essenviews Pretty much everything... they might as well not have even brought it up...
@BarneysNose https://t.co/HQSd3Y5570
@KampferFisher @SabineWilson18 @funder Myth... a lb of fat is equal to a lb of feathers but muscle does really look better than fat...
@PreetBharara @Twanda86701819 Oh makes sense why they are asking about foreign lobbyist registration...
@SabineWilson18 @funder And I love sharing this... trump must be wearing way too many layers of clothes... this is what a man who is 6'2"... and 239 lbs looks like... 		Russell Crowe Robin Hood 2010 https://t.co/VNA0jRcxQ4
@AOC @David_Leavitt You are a force to be reckoned with yourself as a young woman who has stepped forward to bring new blood and better ideas to us. Though not your Mom I'm really proud of your success...
@Stop_Trump20 Open it up as a home for all the kids that have been kidnapped from their parents. Has anyone else posted about the kids being sold off in an adoption scam??? I don't remember where I read that so it may not be true. Just curious...
@kaitlancollins OOPS I need more briefing... LOL Too bad they didn't do this earlier then... 🤧🤧🤧🤧
@suzan5150 @RealMuckmaker Looks like he didn't spit or $@$%^#
@kaitlancollins About time these guys stood up and represented our country and the people. This could have been done a long time ago. I'm wondering if the Bezos/Pecker issue is helping the @GOP stand up to who ever they are indebted to...
@NicolleDWallace @JohnBrennan I have tremendous respect for John. He doesn't hold back when it comes to the danger trump has put the country in and the treasonous behavior. I'll have to write that saying down...
@BarneysNose You can be my VP...
@BarneysNose You know how I know for sure that he didn't have bone spurs??? I couldn't walk with mine and had to have surgery and still having trouble walking... 		I'm moving into the WH and evict him... I am very presidential now so I can run the country... https://t.co/FxFa0tuBn7
@TheRickWilson I think he needs a hungry "African Wild Dog" ... or a pack... they should also take the boy killers of endangered animals and give them a couple of hungry leopards...
@UROCKlive1 @Stop_Trump20 She is a threat to their ultra conservative insanity...
@daralynn13 @Stop_Trump20 @L_ei8ht He would have a quadruple chin when he was facing the camera...
@JillWineBanks We need to have group meetings in our areas to combine our ideas... we might catch up to the Special Counsel that way. I also watching something on Weissman yesterday... he's a powerhouse. trump has more to worry about with him than anyone
@daralynn13 @Stop_Trump20 @L_ei8ht I think so...
@CZing3 @funder @Ninjas53 @StormyDaniels I think we should be putting something out here about the early release for spring and pass it around... he might have that heart attack with that...
@CZing3 @funder @Ninjas53 @StormyDaniels Oh God... I hope not with the descriptions 	they say she has in her book.. 😜😜😜😜
@PrincessBravato Yep... he's not gonna stop until he gets a parade like his handlers do in Russia and NK
@CZing3 @funder @Ninjas53 Evidently... https://t.co/zJY6N2JJse
@CZing3 @funder @Ninjas53 He must be wearing many layers of clothes these days then... this is the physique of a man who is 6'2"... and 239 lbs... https://t.co/9EtxOQGrgq
@ImJohnEli @funder @Tessa73470958 That's what he told Chris @GovChristie to have weight loss surgery... so after his arteries he might want to follow his own weight loss advice... I think Chris would be healthier but if he feels good about himself he shouldn't listen to anyone especially trump
@SenatorCollins Too bad she doesn't put a bill to the floor about helping people who can't drive or take public transportation with a system of non emergency medical transportation. In our area it is only those who are "low income" but even if willing to pay this service is not available
@funder He doesn't want to share the truth with anyone about his health or how far he's indebted to so many foreign or domestic adversaries...
@Acosta No matter what he does to stir up the crowd into such a frenzy... geez they are still shouting lock her up when he is the one that might be wearing more orange than he already does...
@thedailybeast So Pecker is dirty as well... as sleazy...
@adamcbest I'd like to think this was a joke... but he and sr. are just that stupid... need to get him in a Mexican 4X4 with camera crews in tow especially fox and run the fences he said have been built. Too bad someone doesn't call him on this junk...
@make_fair @washdcbhl @realDonaldTrump @BetoORourke @DanScavino @DonaldJTrumpJr There needs to be a bunch of the news teams including fox to go out with trump and ride that "wall" that's been finished already... no one challenges him on this so that is why he gets away with all the lies... he needs to be treated like a 3 yr old and prove what he is saying
@BarneysNose He can't count... https://t.co/GOl7Fg3cBg

@aroseblush OMGeezz... this "Pecker Gate" just keeps getting better...
@EdKrassen @GrassrootsSpeak Well let the @GOP without "sin" cast the first stone... their glass houses are shattering as we speak...
@JillWineBanks @BetteMidler Karen Carpenter or Mary Travers (Peter Paul and Mary)
@JillWineBanks @thedailybeast Well sounds like anyone in my family for a price and not even a big price Pecker shouldn't have sent the emails though. I wonder if he will be in the same wing a the trumps and their minions. You know trump would have better served himself had he stayed out of the lime light
@funder With any luck he won't be a free person by the end of the day... and let's not forget his minions...
@EdanClay He's MORE stupid...
@Mikebattuello @realDonaldTrump Oh we should kick them all out... R or D alike and put new blood in. With financials, security clearances... BEFORE they are even allowed to run. Time to wash the swamp out of D.C.
@Emolclause @Pamforrest3 @SecNielsen @BetsyDeVos LOCK HER UP!!! LOCK HER UP!!! LOCK HER UP!!! 	LOCK HER UP!!! LOCK HER UP!!! LOCK HER UP!!! 	MAKE HER STUDY!!! MAKE HER STUDY!!! MAKE HER STUDY!!! 	MAKE HER STUDY!!! MAKE HER STUDY!!! MAKE HER STUDY!!!
@Bakari_Sellers I don't think it matters does it??? AMI sent out the emails with threats... "no take backs"...
😜😜😜😜 https://t.co/hxKxjCrokj
@CillizzaCNN He just doesn't get it no matter how many times it is told to him...
@goodmorninggggh @EldonParker3 We can only hope he isn't a free man by the end of tomorrow...
@leeleeb50 I think "low" is where she jumped off at...
@williamlegate Not sure but trump can't be 239 lbs... he can't have that many layers of clothes on... 		This is the body of a 6'2"... 239 lb man... https://t.co/nqELawuL4e
@Mikebattuello @realDonaldTrump He already knows he did it...
@dumptrump33 I just had surgery for bone spurs... I had to have them removed because they would never go away (ha hum?? donnie) and they only got worse to the point that I couldn't walk... donnie would be in a wheel chair right now if he really had them
@SaysHummingbird I love her more and more... I can't wait till she is old enough to run for President.. @AOC  is an awesome young lady... I'm so happy to see this young blood that will stand up and help us be counted...
@JillWineBanks So true... https://t.co/Tn5x9OO946
@AmandaCrumleyLA @KatiePhang @maggieNYT Watching him drink all that water reminds me of someone who is diabetic...
@Doyouhaveaflag Or if you have tires... He is a sleaze... definitely a trumpian minion...
@leeleeb50 The Russian Pecker Gate????
@burlphyl @CoryBooker It just got strange when I saw that when they take these top three out of the game... that the GOP next in line would be the Governor... I don't trust any of this anymore... If they can't win honestly they will do anything to get to the top...
@ShelbyKStewart I love her... she was right up in his face... she deserves respect and she put him in his place...
@MattGertz He doesn't care...
@burlphyl @toddzwillich LOCK HIM UP!!! LOCK HIM UP!!! LOCK HIM UP!!!
@waltshaub @RepDougCollins Trying to be like @LindseyGrahamSC at the Kava-beer confirmation..
@NightlyPolitics That's a great idea... but I bet it would be blocked by trump or his minions...
@Doyouhaveaflag Yep..
@owillis @lotsofuss jared is such a sleaze...
@CoryBooker So why is this okay that he resign before there is a full investigation... But then Kavanaugh slides on through to a cushy lifetime appointment to the SC...
@TheRickWilson Oh Geezz... what the hell he met the guy for about an hour and I don't think hate tweets count as getting to know him...
@ChelseaClinton @ClintonFdn @2SmallToFail @HealthierGen @CHAI_health @CGIU Ya know what the heck is wrong with this Owens woman???

@cj_spinks @waltshaub @AOC I am on the wrong coast to vote for her this year but I really think they should lower the age for candidates to run for president. She was pretty good on her run for Congress but seeing her now she is so impressive...
@AOC Wow I just saw you questioning a panel that included @waltshaub . I so hope I live long enough for you to become president. You are an "On Fire" young lady and I think you will be very successful in your political career. Either that or we can lower the age of candidates
@waltshaub I just saw the piece of @AOC questioning you and some others and I think the R's really need to worry if Alexandria gets elected to an even higher office... she is a real spit fire... I like her more and more... I hope I live long enough to see her become president.
@kbcon @robreiner I don't look that bad when I fall asleep in the steam room at the gym for a day or two...
@Kevinliptakcnn He has been paid to look the other way just like jared
@waltshaub He needs to be smacked upside the head and sent to his room to ponder his poor behavior...
@20committee @medit8now I keep wondering how many more skeletons will be popping out of the safe in the "Pecker Gate" scandal

@DerekCressman @KimTompkins14 Ya know we really will have to get new blood in the WH. all of his admins and most of the CEO's of the companies that have bought him off will be in the trump wing of the prison. I think I'll apply for a job there just so I can have the privilege of seeing all of them in prison

@mkraju Nope I'll get up a group and we'll march on this one... Mom's wouldn't put up with this from their own kids so we definitely won't tolerate it from an old man...
@tedlieu @FAANews Oh I think all the people who fly should just not fly one or two days... I bet the airline lobbyists would fix his wagon real quick...
@maggieNYT Oh he needs to be careful because she will kick him in the "slats" ...
@DavidCornDC Then she can take her groceries to the local pantry and not have any food or cash... (freeze all the assets of all the family) so they know what these people are going through...
@AshaRangappa_ Double SNAP!!!!!
@BarneysNose Coconut Cream...
@senatemajldr You are either being paid to say this or extortion is the  other option... You have failed the people who voted you in and the rest of the people who are affected by your non action...
@TheBeatWithAri @Kathatestrump @AriMelber @carterwpage @jerome_corsi @NunbergSam @MichaelRCaputo What a waste of air time...
@RobWittman @HouseGOP @SpeakerPelosi I think you need to realize who started this... Nancy wasn't even in power when this came down the pike... @realDonaldTrump needs to step up to the plate and think about the people not himself...
@AriMelber @MSNBC Will be missing this show...
@Mimirocah1 @david_hemond When will the authorities take action???
@krassenstein The prime example of the lack of education in some areas...
@treasonstickers I think @SpeakerPelosi would connect a foot to the center of trump... I don't think she would tolerate his abuse... in any form...
@TeamPelosi @laureldavilacpa We need t hang in there... I'm giving gift cards to the local FBI and any other cheated employees I can find. Won't be much but maybe we can challenge everyone to do just a little bit...
@treasonstickers @mattgaetz @Jim_Jordan Money??? Video??? they are just as dirty as Nunes and trump, mitch, lindsey, I'll run out of characters...
@Newlysane I was just thinking a similar idea about all the jet setting Melanie (🤣) and the kids and even the pres... he shouldn't go to N. Korea or anywhere else until he does the right thing. they shouldn't get food or money either. freeze assets of @GOP espec.  @senatemajldr
@david_hemond SunTrust Bank in Sebring, Florida now 5 dead... shooter is all well and good in custody.. so tired of this.. and it hasn't directly affected my family. But the families it has deserve the respect to have a stop put to this. That their family member didn't die in vain...
@jaketapper @kaitlancollins @TheLeadCNN Good... there is a pig pen on a farm somewhere that might have him...
@krassenstein I'm getting so tired of this... the swat teams need to shoot dead and ask questions later... there is no consequences for these shootings... just notoriety...
@PalmerReport I'd watch that one...
@myserenity69 @PattyLehner Then open up the government @realDonaldTrump and I'll write to @SpeakerPelosi personally...
@joshscampbell We don't want to hear from you @realDonaldTrump we have over 8000 lies that have come out of your mouth... you should quit while you are behind...
@StopTrump2020 He's getting ready for Putin...
@BarneysNose Hopefully this makes you laugh... https://t.co/KwmauxY4Nn
@amyriscool @American_Bridge @PrincessBravato @SenatorCollins Oh I'm sure @SpeakerPelosi isn't afraid of trump but collins is beholden to someone in the trump/putin lovefest...
@NRCC NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO and did I mention 		NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO
@BarneysNose Darn I missed this part?? Where do I find the write up???
@DBTillman @tedlieu I'll give you on the 6.754 times but that's still over the top That many Pinocchio's is way too many and he doesn't even try to hide that he lies. And still Rudy needs to be taken back to the home and medicated. I don't think anyone else is better they just aren't president
@EdKrassen "Man-Baby" hasn't accepted "NO" before and thinks that he can break @SpeakerPelosi  down... I think he has misjudged his "Speaker of the House"
@thehill You know turtles live over 150 yrs... that isn't good news... @senatemajldr is on the take as well.. let's do an audit... I'll volunteer from my side and we can get someone else on the other. And then let's go down the line.
@KellyO @LindseyGrahamSC @SpeakerPelosi Oh I'm thinking that voting to remove sanctions on adversaries would be worse... all the "trips" to Russia for senators and even money $800K to you that we know of... that is really the "Low in American @GOP Politics"... remember John McCain is looking down on you
@DBTillman @tedlieu Well let's go back to tweets by trump and think about what comes out of Rudy's mouth... and your president has lied or misspoke over 8,000 times... I'll go with what trump and his minions say...
@StopTrump2020 @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/Dhr9H1TlhS
@kaitlancollins No "Man-Baby" you cannot have your cookie until you do what you are supposed to do... Like think about our country not Putin's...		@realDonaldTrump  do the right think for a change...
@Yamiche He would know about being a puppet... Putin's puppet... https://t.co/6Upgdpb1Hb
@ABC Oh I have a feeling that trump will be remembered as more of a negative part of history than anyone at this point...
@Yamiche And he's afraid of reality tv show hosts...
@eugenegu @MaryAnn26920610 I think we should vote... I'm thinking it would be trump that would need to pack his bags...
@tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump "Man-baby" will continue to throw his temper tantrum until he gets his cookie... (wall)
@psychdr100 We have to stand strong against the "Man-baby"... we also need to help those who are affected by his temper tantrum...
@American_Bridge @PrincessBravato @SenatorCollins She's afraid of "Man-baby" as well...
@joncoopertweets @SpeakerPelosi Man-baby will continue to throw a fit... until he actually realizes that not everyone like @GOP will just wilt at his every desire no matter how stupid it is...
@ABC I agree... I didn't get my check either... it's not easy truly... I just see that Man-baby will keep pulling this if he doesn't get his cookie...
@BrianKarem https://t.co/zKG1i3Ppds

@revrrlewis @AllResistance Oh Pleeaaassseeee... You better sue almost everyone on twitter that said the same thing... just another stunt by this punk and the money his family has to do this... Let's enable these kids... who is next teachers???
@tedlieu Why have detectives not arrested both of them for this??? You and I would be in jail and they would have thrown the key away by now... 		Pin a badge on me I'll do it...
@jimsciutto @jaketapper Does this constitute 		O-B-S-T-R-U-C-T-I-O-N????

@TheRickWilson We need to buy stock in the Kleenex corp before that...
@CharlesMBlow I DID TOO!!!!!
@davidaxelrod But that would make sense...
@SocialPowerOne1 @Chris17039575 Pretty sad... but makes me wonder if it's not just money that the senators have been given... maybe some threats to them and/or their families...

@nowthisnews @BetsyGervasi I'm curious as to how many times a two yr old has seen her father get arrested that she knows to put up her hands???
@BradGunnerSGT @Pamforrest3 @NarcTranslator @kenvogel @senatemajldr @LindseyGrahamSC @MittRomney @JohnCornyn @SenatorBurr @tedcruz @RonJohnsonWI @SenJohnThune And the Russians have more money to add to their campaigns...
@gorillastyle @forthepatrie @thehill Notice how those who follow trump can be so hateful and spout the most inappropriate half witted and imbecilic comments???
@forthepatrie @gorillastyle @thehill I don't dance on anyone's grave not even trump when that day comes... he has kids especially his youngest who deserves a father...
@gorillastyle @forthepatrie @thehill Touche'... very well said...
@forthepatrie @gorillastyle @thehill Missy I have worked since I was 14 yrs old for my "government handout"... Actually I have "PAID" into Social Security and Medicare for 44 yrs... If you have paid into "handouts" that long then you wouldn't be chiding the rest of us...
@forthepatrie @gorillastyle @thehill Kind of a pathetic thing to say... did you get that out of the "trump inappropriate comments to make"???
@IanSams @KamalaHarris I want a t-shirt... We need to find a good catchy phrase... I'll see what I can do... I am all in for Kami... LOL

@BarneysNose @realDonaldTrump trump and Rudy need to pick a lane... they are all over the road...
@thehill Stayed an awful long time for the worst job... I would have been gone the first day... that is if I had been in a cave for the past 3 yrs... wouldn't have taken the job at all being subjected to the trump team in the news...
@docrocktex26 @scruffage They are really uneducated... I have a few books for them to read... or color if that makes it easier for them...
@tommychong Not meaning to be disrespectful truly I have always loved Tommy's humor and life...		Pretty bad that we have someone who partied with us through the 70's and 80's that is the voice of reason... 		Go Tommy... You're the best... well and Cheech...
@thehill "Pick a Lane Rudy"... you're all over the road...
@jdawsey1 @PreetBharara Setting up an insanity plea for trump and himself...
@MSNBC I'm glad they told me she was African American... I don't think we would have guessed... Can't we just say she is throwing her hat in the ring... so tired of all this "let's make sure we point out ethnicity, sexual orientation, " ...

@RepSwalwell Well said... tributes to great men can never seem like enough...
@SaysHummingbird Just finished a class on the Civil War and Reconstruction and Dr. King is putting this politely... the wrongs that were done to those who fought next to the white soldiers and died bleeding the same color blood were not compensated...

@Tonja1208Tonja @tonyposnanski @jendiEvgeniya Maybe that kid needs to go over to Iran/Syria/Afghanistan and stare ISIS down like that... I'm sure ISIS would give up immediately...

@EdKrassen @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump They were useless before that too... or trump wouldn't have gotten into D.C. let alone the White House...
@HoarseWisperer It seems the whole CNN group had gotten too odd to watch or listen to anymore... or even read about...
@joncoopertweets He needs to be locked away for insanity as well... trump couldn't even 		"smell where MLK Jr. farted" as my Dad would say... 		Dr. King was truly and educated man... and before people say "but he did..." doesn't matter he made a positive mark in history trump will not

@StevenBeschloss How about a couple hundred hours of community service on the reservation... as well as the parents/chaperones that had them in D.C. ...
@AngrierWHStaff Promises... Promises...
@TheKerryOMalley I would jerk my kid up and make them apologize... In front of everyone... as well as on the school website/facebook page... this is disgusting... in my kid's day they would have been punished much more severely...
@SeptemberDresan @CovCathColonels I'm pretty sure this has been asked already But		WHERE ARE THE PARENTS/CHAPERONES FOR THIS GROUP??? 		That needs to be addressed. 1) If those kids were left unsupervised the adults need to be reprimanded. 2) If the adults were there and didn't stop this they should be also be
@Moordairdachs @wesing4blue @Vote4Sanity2020 @realDonaldTrump Predator in Chief... that sounds right as well...

@RepAdamSchiff Except that trump and mcconnell and the @GOP have been paid off by "Daddy Vladdy" to lift sanctions...
@TheRickWilson Good one... I hope she does it...
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump He doesn't care about those...they are hostages like the kids in cages...

@KwikWarren But I'm a Mom and truck driver... so I have to call people sweetie, honey, Missy, Buddy... I'll have to remember that for you... and no you aren't an idiot or a fool. I've followed you long enough to know that. I'll try not to adopt you but I can't promise
@kaitlancollins This is almost like episodes of the bachelor... all the girly drama from our president... he needs therapy...
@rmasher2 @senatemajldr I think you are right... probably both...
@atrupar He reminds me of a cartoon character that is talking in slow motion... he needs help... and a CPAP machine to help his breathing...
@SenatorDurbin @IAmJoeTrudeau Everyone should... mcconnel is a sleazy swamp resident and doesn't deserve to be paid for his position. he is not worth the dirt I walk on...
@Abby4Iowa @KimTompkins14 @senatemajldr Grassely has dementia and escaped from the home again along with the rest of the sleazy swamp creatures... they have either money they don't care... Putin's payroll keeps them going...
@siano2020 Don't tease me now... LOL I'm gonna take a guess...		DTJr...
@mkraju @tedbarrettcnn She is useless...
@ParadigmRuth @mkraju @tedbarrettcnn I agree truly...
@ParadigmRuth @mkraju @tedbarrettcnn I agree... I think we all need to oust ALL of these idiots... seriously... and find people who are real leaders and not reality stars... all of these people are playing at being in trump's reality show: White House season... we are all prisoner to a selfish child...
@DearAuntCrabby Oh me as well... I may need a cigarette... https://t.co/2eh89M4fTz
@GarrettHaake https://t.co/vvV1HD1L4D
@realAliTweets @ConservativeSti Faster than the speed of light...
@OkCallMeAL and she has tasered his "wangdoodle" as well... (thank LA @SenJohnKennedy for that word) and I don't think she will let go till he's gone... Go Nancy Go!!!
@EdKrassen Maybe @LindseyGrahamSC should be the first one to start the movement to work together...
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Yea... the border has been such a problem in my 62 yrs that we have been all fighting for a wall all my life... 🙄🙄🙄🙄
@mkraju @tedbarrettcnn Charge them all retroactively and in the future "after they all stay here and get this mess cleared up"... People have suffering here and being played as pawns... Kids are being treated like they don't matter... as well as those who can't care for themselves and need medical
@CJBurberry You would be shocked...
@treasonstickers Both really...
@ddiamond Doesn't surprise me a bit... so if these sick idiots don't want people of color in America then why are they separating kids that can't be returned to parents and countries where they came from... not saying this is the right answer but it's a giant problem...
@itsJeffTiedrich I agree...
@WajahatAli @DemsLGBT And resignation...
@jdawsey1 @Pamforrest3 No one needs to go anywhere until the get this nonsense figured out...
@kaitlancollins No one needs to be doing anything but getting back to work for those who elected them to do... or else they don't get pay and bank accounts get frozen as well... let them see how it feels..
@medit8now @candodem @BarneysNose Well then she's definitely a prime candidate for president... Liar Liar pants on fire...
@jaketapper @BarneysNose They all need to stay put and get our country and those in true need help... these people all have the money to pay for their own tickets on commercial flights and in some cases buy their own planes... get real...
@AngrierWHStaff @DearAuntCrabby @GOPSenate They are owned by "Daddy Vladdy"...

@TheRickyDavila @SusanCCraig Don't even watch @CNN anymore... nothing but reality tv shows with people arguing and talking over one another... or rather yelling over one another... waste of time...

@MontyBoa99 @JeniZillOnley @DavidBrodyCBN @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump This is how trump plays president...
@igypup9 @treasonstickers @AdamSchiff @MittRomney Yup... it's a @GOP thing anymore... which is why I'm a dem now... I'm hoping that enough of my former party members came with me... we did help I hope in Midterms... I hope...
@treasonstickers @JeniZillOnley Hug a person of color...
@SpoxDHS @CNN @TSA I was at the airport... I don't need CNN to know the truth.. but they are reporting it... the truth that is...
@SecPompeo National Religious Freedom Day is never having to say you have sold out our country...
@SenGillibrand Sorry Missy... I am a @alfranken fan...
@jennobenno @PattyLehner I think so... we should have an audit on the whole lot of them... even dems... lets not be partisan...
@edwardbrowden @jean_oristano @kylegriffin1 Yep... he's being told by "Daddy Vladdy" to do this... I doubt he's smart enough to think of it on his own... but Putin would and did it seems...
@TruthChanges If I get to be the surgeon?? Absolutely... https://t.co/1guk4DV7Cd
@dylanmsmitty @PollyPapaya How much more despicable can they be when they sell out our country at the expense of those who have given their lives to keep us safe from Russia... now @GOP sells out to Deripaska... and ultimately Putin... thx mushroom head....
@ChrisMurphyCT @garybridges54 He's being bought for to perform as the circus monkey he is... (shouldn't offend circus monkeys)
@ReneeHoagenson @EldonParker3 My new motto...		It's not who or what you know.... it's who you owe...
@thehill That's because he's a paid lackey of Putin as well... or else he would put America first like the prez should... and @GOP...
@SenFeinstein @rsmale The sanctions bomb to shatter America is already in play... @MittRomney @BernieSanders and the rest of the @GOP who have sold our country down the river.. I don't need to ask if you got paid enough. you must have...
@McFaul @PostOpinions @GOP Neither will history unless that gets high jacked as well...
@McFaul @PostOpinions I'm worried for you and all of our citizens with this blatant disregard for the good of our nation.. Senators seem to be on the take... all of them... @GOP we will not forget...
@Stop_Trump20 Touche'...
@JRubinBlogger @Kathatestrump It's not who or what you know... it's who you owe it seems...
@ABC Are these guys that big of idiots that they don't see how ridiculous they are to the whole world when they talk like this??? So embarrassing...
@lisastark351 @johnlundin Agreed...
@TruthChanges Another thing to add to the list of big wins it seems... "The likes of which the world has never seen before"...
@BlueLanternUSA @senatemajldr @GOP @realDonaldTrump It's not what you know... it's who you owe...
@waltshaub @JillWineBanks I'm beginning to think that it's not who you know.... it's who you owe...
@treasonstickers @AdamSchiff @MittRomney should be added to that list... I fought for him to be president... and he has just voted against saving our nation... just as well he didn't become president. I thought he would be a better senator... sad to be wrong...
@Lawrence @AriMelber Wait till you're old Ari??? You will count it as a blessing... you can use it to the tune of your favorite Hip Hop songs... LOL
@funder @lister_lester Guess it's a good thing Mitt wasn't voted in president either... he's scum as well as sanders. I admit that sexual harassment is important... he should have voted first... So now what does Putin have on @MittRomney ???
@BetteMidler OMGeezz... that's a good thing... even the girls could learn something from this... we all need to be better examples to ALL the kids...
@BetteMidler Okay I missed the commercial evidently... what are our guys worried about now... as if we could make them do anything they didn't want to anyway???
@KwikWarren Yup... she's not a game changer for my review of candidates...
@BarneysNose Curiouser and Curiouser... 🤔🤔🤔🤔
@MeetThePress @jahimes Everyone on Capital Hill and the WH officials including trump should not be allowed to spend one penny even of their own money until this is over... they have it good while those who are mere government employees are left to fend for themselves... (the mere part was sarcastic)
@ZemanLynnZ @_ReaalAmerican_ @VP He's as big an idiot as the prez
@TheRynheart @senatemajldr He can't he's owned by Putin as well...

@SassyKadiK @Cookie19Loveho1 @GOP They will most likely already be in Russian uniforms and following their true leader...

@PrincessBravato Well turn about is fair play... someone is prison will be grabbing him by the #$@$% ...
@CREWcrew I'm thinking he will... he won't be able to stand not taking an opportunity to be the "big cheese" (ha ha ha fake cheddar cheese) and the attention he craves...
@PrincessBravato He's probably been on the take for decades as well...
@BoltsRandy @AHepburn100 @C_Sommerfeldt @Fahrenthold @realDonaldTrump @NYDailyNews Pharmaceutical companies, most politicians, defense contractors, feel free to add more to the list...
@george_capen And how many other children did he have contact with??? Doctors and anyone else that had a part in holding this child hostage should be held accountable and prosecuted... including the criminal in chief...

@TrashyChic It's becoming a fading memory...

@BarneysNose @PattyLehner https://t.co/9hcyxtuJbl
@rllane17 @Progressivegran @treasonstickers Oh wow... that makes sense... all those who are running for office after primaries should have physicals with docs picked out by lottery system just so it would be fair... and all of them...  bipartisan....
@JillWineBanks I don't understand it either... he is really whacked... our country needs to be set free...
@EdKrassen Oh please... she doesn't have the ability to handle her own life either... another circus will roll into town...
@politvidchannel @PattyLehner The Dems need to hang tough... He doesn't need his vanity wall. His name will be all across the fence... He's not a president I want to remember nor do I want  people to lose their property so he can do this...
@SteveSchmidtSES @AuschwitzMuseum We must always remember and share the history of the horror and terror so many millions of people suffered and the ones that were murdered.
@joncoopertweets @IvankaTrump It will probably be a limited number being crafted. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
@klodaski_v @Liveoveaugh @LindseyGrahamSC I agree...
@Progressivegran @treasonstickers Yup... not sure what was going on with trying to drink out of the water bottle that time... he really isn't well enough to be under the stress of being the president'''
@StanSheriff I do understand the anger though. My son is an officer and I would probably be just as angry... Rest in Paradise and comfort and condolences to his family... 💞💞💞💞
@StopTrump2020 He needs to be sent to his room and take his phone and tv away for a month or year or so...
@krassenstein I'd like to think that it wasn't legal... but trump seems to slither through things like this...
@Acosta @nytimes I guess they are going to kill these kids one way or another... either starve them or send them into  battle against grown men who have been trained... so wrong..
We want sensible methods. Ones that don't leave people in countries where their lives are in danger. I think it would be a good idea to go and clean up the country so people could stay in their homes... https://t.co/O4FaPsY2S7

@cooltolerance @StanSheriff About like the last caravan... only we don't have an election to get hyped up for... I'll put on the coffee and tamales just in case...
@TrashyChic I've been saying that when I first heard he was just thinking about running... so this is not a surprise but it's a horrid action to the people he is supposed to represent... he needs to slither off the the pen before the SC comes for him...
@KamalaHarris @KimTompkins14 This makes me so angry... single mom years ago but the landlord may need to make payments on property and if she has car payments... what is wrong with that trump idiot. He hurts the ones he's supposed to be supporting...
@shossy2 @JeffFlake Touche'...
@treasonstickers That's why he has false teeth...
@LindseyGrahamSC @TomMetrick What "Daddy Vladdy" wants Donnie will bend over backwards to give him...
@treasonstickers Why doesn't his family take care of him... I can see Melanie (JK) just wanting to leave him to die but his adult kids could take action... but then they may be waiting for him to kick the bucket too...

@deborah_combs @AdamParkhomenko @SFutorian Wow... I wouldn't have guessed that... I have only seen him going to and from the WH from trips or when he was at the inauguration...
@cooltolerance @StanSheriff This Sheriff isn't protecting criminals illegal or not... sanctuary cities just can't hold illegals for ICE has nothing to do with the police arresting a murderer...
@NikkiSchwab @Acosta @JeffFlake After all his backing down on so many issues I don't think he should run. It will be a waste of money. He lost me (after quite a few disappointments) after the Kavanaugh vote...
@StanSheriff You are politicizing this and talking about the presidents agenda...  protect and serve not preach politics...
@MSNBC How does he have all the power to do these idiotic things without some kind of restraints... Too much power too little brain... he's a detriment to society...
@MarkWarner @worm_castles trump wants to win so bad he will make sure that the rest of the country will lose...
@krassenstein If he doesn't get is own way like the petulant child he is then he will destroy everything he can...

@johnlundin Oh God I hope so... we can't really take another week of this let alone 2 yrs...

@cjrmurphy1 @SFutorian My friend lost $40K over the market in the past 6 months... I hope this helps get the investment back...
@amvetsupport @BetsyGervasi Daddy Vladdy wanted them ... he had to oblige...
@PalmerReport And everyone else that had a hand in it...
@SwampyTrump But Daddy Vladdy had him do that so he knows where SEALS are posted... I'm surprised there aren't more pics...
@alex_nman Ich spiele gitarre... und trinke Kaffee... das ist meine Freude 🤣🤣🤣🤣
@DesignationSix I won't...
@BarneysNose I would have invited you... https://t.co/QAOg7odg1x
@funder Can you change that to 		Impeachment next day???
@EdKrassen I'll think you are right...
@PalmerReport Isn't there a loophole to "Unvote" him out...
@TruthChanges There has to be a loophole to "unvote" him...
@SolfuegoA @justthinking014 @lahtifield @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @FLOTUS #TrumpPresentDanger we should start that one around...
@kelley1952 @PrincessBravato @realDonaldTrump Daddy Vladdy had him go take pics with SEALS so Daddy knows where they are..
@iamfonda Daddy Vladdy had him go and take pics with SEALS so Daddy would know where he could go when he invades...
@CREWcrew @Smason2126L Oh such a surprise that @senatemajldr would be on the take... and then there is the cocaine running from his inlaws... https://t.co/vxPRj1Dat8
@t4d09 @Acosta Daddy Vladdy probably told him to...
That's the traitor in chief for us... https://t.co/NrirY9fsxS
@funder No applause for posting photos with SEALS in a combat zone either...
@Stop_Trump20 Stupid Dumb $#it...
@BarneysNose Well if he did he took and released a pic of the SEALS in a combat zone... really bright for the pres and stupid in chief...
@EarthGoddess52 @WayneMony @nytimes Yep... he is so dumb... I don't know how we are gonna make it through this year let alone the next...
@TranslateRealDT And outs SEALS at the base... Daddy Vladdy strikes again...

@Alt_FedEmployee @justthinking014 Good job... you got it right...
@MollyMcKew @IAmJoeTrudeau He is beyond ignorant...
@thehill Not the one that counts...
@Acosta Ya but it was fun to think of all the reasons he might have played cloak and dagger... Like parachuting into Russia, or because of the shutdown that his pilots and crew would have parachuted out of the plane with a note that said you have a bigly brain you can land this plane
@rolandscahill @KimTompkins14 Now we know why his pant legs were so baggy in the Christmas pics... His waist is so big that if they had tailored his pants it gut would have been much more obvious than it is in this picture...

@MLOwens1962 @kaitlancollins Oh we need to have a hashtag or retweet campaign that keeps the bone spurs thing number one trending today...
@HortyM @krassenstein Maybe those on Wall St. knew something and that's why stocks are rising... maybe they knew that trump was defecting... LOL
@ElGoodo63 @krassenstein If you wait just a bit the pilots and crew will don parachutes and leave him to his own bigly brain to land safely...
@WayneMony @EarthGoddess52 @nytimes Yes... this president flips and flops so much the idea of taking troops out of Afghanistan was a diversion from all his criminal activities being in the news...
@PalmerReport As my Grandma Nellie used to say		"He doesn't know if he's comin' or goin' or even if he's been sent for"... 		Grandma was smart...
@thehill Dan will have to send him pictures and crayons in order for trump to understand what marginal means...
@EarthGoddess52 @WayneMony @nytimes I think he is planning on taking half out of Afghanistan...
@kylegriffin1 Oh no... really??? he was dishonest??? How could that happen with trump at the wheel??? I'm so shocked... I need more coffee...
@funder 192 hours or 11520 minutes or 691200 seconds... but I'm not counting much...

@davidfrum Or judicial matters,
@seungminkim @SenBobCorker I have trouble some days with the hydro flasks... forgetting the gasket, don't put the lid on straight... or just plain spilling it... but I will still have to have my coffee... it is for public safety... LOL

Weigh in on this if you will... https://t.co/hhQSBgto3y
@HurricanePotty @TLo7154 Retweet in support of those who are paying for this president... the one person that should be looking out for our nation...
@thehill Not surprising... I had family members die because of this idiot's money... but they aren't a shame and stain on this country like the president is...
@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump Didn't he go to Mar a logo earlier? I thought I read that here...
@funder @PrincessBravato @realDonaldTrump From @maddow post on facebook. 🤣🤣🤣🤣 https://t.co/QGLdg4d81t
@thehill Younger blood and not as self-centered as those who have no vision time for us ol' folks to go fishing, knit or rocking on the porch. I wish someone in my state/city would also run. We need people not dependent on lobbyists

@JuliaMorales This is so awesome... I wish I was as active as Dad. I'm 62 and can't move like that. I bought my son Jammies like the younger man in the video.. I'll have to steal your idea for next year. Merry Christmas to your family..🎅🎅🎅🎅

@Augustus709 He was whacked before he was elected...  before he was 30... R's had a chance to do the right thing.. they just sat back and counted their money... Russia has been very good to them...

@Mastermind7864 Hound them... I changed to a democrat to be better represented... my representatives will not like me if they give in to a temper tantrum... can we throw temper tantrums too??? Or is it just trump???

@funder Slithering @$$hole...
@MollyJongFast @jaketapper Too little to late... he had a chance to do the right thing... but nope... I think audit his financials...
@Comey @keithellison ALL SENATORS and REPRESENTATIVES should donate their pay to those who will suffer from this... they are not admitting they are at fault or the like... just that they have a heart and compassion. Not all of us make $174K a year...
@SenFeinstein @AllResistance Join the club @SenFeinstein and donate your pay to those who are going to suffer from this shutdown... Cummings is going to and @SenBlumenthal ... it don't say you are at fault it means you have a heart and compassion...
#ResignTrump Amen... he needs to slither on to prison where he belongs... https://t.co/ZeyyQkais7
@nudog71 @srquinn47 Love the Lindsey one LOL

@JackBox Mine didn't have bacon on it... it was disappointing..
@EdKrassen @AllResistance How do we get justice for Khashoggi's family when this sleaze in the WH...
@RepCummings @suzan5150 They should get their pay as usual... they need their money now... not later... not everyone makes $178K a yr plus expenses...
@BarneysNose I'm baking cookies right now... Chocolate Chip done starting Peanut Butter then Snickerdoodles...
@PhantomOfTheWH @suzan5150 Mix his meds in chocolate pudding so he will take it... it will only help...
@brianschatz I'll follow this cuz I don't know either...
@shossy2 @abigailkjohnso5 @LindseyGrahamSC Well if he puts so many people in poverty they won't be able to fight back... trump is such a sleaze and he slithers back to the swamp leaving Americans even the ones who trusted and voted for him (foolishly) to flounder...
@Stop_Trump20 Touche'... LOL
@AprilDRyan @rsmale Who's plane did he take???
@BarneysNose It's only 6:54 pm PST so we still have time... LOL
@BillKristol @SykesCharlie Operative phrase		If they had guts and self-respect...
@ananavarro Nope...
@MollyMcKew @adeleatplay Sounds a lot funky to me... can't trust any of these people...
@EdKrassen Too little too late... had a chance to stop the madness but was too busy voting for the "tax cut" so he could get his $$$ for his multi-million dollar businesses...
@StopTrump2020 @GOP I actually think that all those in the house and senate should give their pay to all those who will be short changed by all these idiots playing games with the employee's livelihood...
@EdKrassen @LisaLeo555 @LindseyGrahamSC @senatemajldr Grassely... and anyone that doesn't pass or participate in a financial audit... as for President 2020 should be the top five minus Bernie... He has earned sitting at the edge of a lake and fishing...
@AprilDRyan @SFutorian APRIL!!!! Where have you been?? I have missed you... hope all is well... 		Merry Christmas... 🎅🎅🎅🎅

@BillKristol They are all beholden to Russia...
@EdKrassen @coleyworld Idiots... they have no clue how the aid system works...
@AmoneyResists @coleyworld They have keepers and meds... some days they escape and this happens...
@kenolin1 @alxstrda1396 This woman needs to be medicated and taken to the funny farm...
@TravisAllen02 @OleanderNectar Republicans because they had a chance to keep this under control and they threw it away with both hands...
@Chris17039575 I agree... trump is just handing this country over every opportunity he has...
#TrumpResign  needs to be number one... https://t.co/CsfcJzW1JB
@DearAuntCrabby I am thinking Deutsche Bank as well...
@DafnaLinzer @KenDilanianNBC And we have an "Acting President" who doesn't know how to act...

@3L3V3NTH Oh you are amazing... what a great idea... and all on video as well...

@IAmJoeTrudeau Most of integrity... I wasn't very happy with him for a while but I truly think he was trying to guide trump... so when he quit I understood... not that it won't follow him though. No one leaves the trump admin without stain on their character...
To all those who need to celebrate... treat yourself to a pair of platform shoes... 🤣🤣🤣🤣 https://t.co/GTiONo41wQ

@flyaway_k Trump - alcohol, Xanax, pot, chocolate... anything else that helps you to recover from very stressful situations...
@realDonaldTrump @BetsyGervasi Please see a doctor... I will take you and make sure you get the appropriate help since your family doesn't give a $#it... I don't care either but I do have compassion for as the bible says... God loves fools and little children...
@cryborg @BetsyGervasi I'm afraid I have to agree with you... I hope we are both wrong...

@_ReaalAmerican_ @LindseyGrahamSC @JudgeJeanine @FoxNews That must be why he had a complete personality switch right have John McCain passed away. So he has 800K reasons to follow what "Daddy Vladdy" tells him to
@LizSly @kstreet111 Anything to change the news cycle from the Mattis letter.... and the never ending criminal indictments being filed against him...
@LindseyGrahamSC @JudgeJeanine @FoxNews Oh SERIOUSLY!!!!!! Come on you just start to get back to being a senator for the people and ZAP!!!! you are back on FOX... so disappointing... I may have to get my niece to vote for someone else...
@mkraju @Phil_Mattingly Okay Chuckie @senchuckschumer  you said he would get "NO" wall what's going on??? You do realize you can't bargain with terrorists right? Don't fail us now... I changed parties because you promised to stand up to trump. Don't get all trumpian on us now let @NancyPelosi take over

@ArtSchnurple @eclecticbrotha Ah... that's where they are coming from... who would have known... trump didn't mention them on his slithering down the escalator that horrible fateful day for the whole U.S.

@chrislhayes @PersevereEver Yep... can Flake change his vote??? I mean the day isn't over yet???
@samstein @PrincessBravato They shouldn't get paid either... and have to sit this out one week for every day they don't vote for the people for once...
#TrumpResign https://t.co/Ort48U2KL4
@AdamParkhomenko @pixiekat666 Nope and I think he's all that and more...
@SallyAlbright OMGeezz... I bet you and I will both lose sleep over this right??? NOT!!!
@BlakeHardeman @joshscampbell @realDonaldTrump And there we have it... audit financials of Kava beer, Gorsuch,
@TheRickWilson @thedailybeast I don't blame him for leaving. History will not be kind to all of those who stood by and watched as trump handed over our country to putin or anyone else that has tapes, pic, video, bank records??? the list is too long...
@kstreet111 So we will have another GoFundMe scam like the guy who helped the couple who needed gas money or something??? Even people who don't know trump personally are crooks...
#TrumpResign https://t.co/DFpp5aKsSY
@marklevinshow I get the impression that no one wants to be remembered in history for supporting this petulant 2 yr old ... history will not be kind to even the descendants of these  people. I'm a budding historian and I see many books to write on these subjects
@senatemajldr @ChrisCuomo let's not end with a pres in WH determined to rip our country apart get in boat senator lead or get out of the way your chance to redeem yourself as well as the other senators for allowing this 2 yr old to run the US $$$ over country not what people voted u in 4
@SenJeffMerkley as a constituent of yours I am increasingly concerned about the state of our nation. Is there some way we can put to a vote how these bills proceed. trump should be taken out of office on #25for45 we need to save children, women and men. Our allies as well
@JeniZillOnley @RepSwalwell Good idea... @SenJeffMerkley needs to hear from me as well..
#TrumpResign https://t.co/bzLW3sSLrp
#TrumpResign https://t.co/kLY0PX2uXR
@RepSwalwell @JeniZillOnley Can this be put to a vote to the American People???
@davidmweissman his base will believe anything he tells them... study to make themselves knowledgeable is not in their chromosomes...
@desiderioDC Good  poster child for intelligence tests for officials who plan to run for office to represent the American People...
@RawStory OH PLEASE!!!!! I want to be his "pool girl" then... So ridiculous...
@CNNBusiness Oh please... we all knew he was a crook because he was involved with the oligarchs... and if there are no checks/audits on those being put in those positions of authority then this can happen again... from dog catcher to president... R's or D's... everyone...
@BresPolitico @JeffFlake Just call Limbaugh, Hannity and Ingram... they will let you know...
@BillOReilly That's really sick...
@screamin_mimi6 I'd have to agree with you...
@LeeGronberg You shouldn't stand in the way of trump confusing his base with the facts... 🤣🤣🤣🤣
@ellievan65 Does she do nothing in her office but her nails?? or did she need color books as well??
@CNN he knows about trafficking with all of his employees he smuggles in to work in his golf courses... I want to know where he got all his numbers at???
@Bakari_Sellers Lord wrap Your healing arms around RBG and bring her healing and strength... And Lord also Patti Labelle... We ask this in the Name of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ ~ Amen

#TrumpResign https://t.co/27WjcpuonM
@burgessev @BresPolitico They have been all this time... too bad they didn't pull their heads out of their @$$e$ before trump did so much damage...
@Mary81904509 @tombrokaw And the $$$$$$$$$$$ he can steal from anyone else... but you pegged that right...
@RawieDarren @dvorakoelling I think that should have started with Fred... then we wouldn't have any of them
@DavidCornDC @IAmJoeTrudeau I didn't think about that.. maybe trump with all his bigly brain thought that he could stop the investigation???
@BarneysNose didn't know if you saw this but it's worth seeing again... https://t.co/8IXNiQsNd1
@PoxNewsCEO OMG!!!! I can't believe how stupid... well never mind yes I can believe it they voted for trump...
@mkraju @TerrieC12 I will remember Corker for his votes on the "tax cut" and the Kava-beer confirmation...
#25thForThe45th https://t.co/fhvadLDl5r
@frankthorp @yashar But I will remember him for his backing down on the Kava-beer vote...
@Mary81904509 @tombrokaw That is one of the languages I am learning for my doctorate... Just in case...
#TrumpResign https://t.co/77IcwYqtO2
@TheRickWilson In 3... 2... 1...
@PatrickRandall @LCARS_24 @brycetache @AllisonRhody56 Yup... and when he;s no longer useful to putin (he's already useless to us) there will be some kind of car accident or spiked drink of some sort... trump played with fire and he will get burned... just a matter of time...
@BarbraStreisand Congress needs to put him in a time out... for about 2 yrs should do it...
@mindyanns @EnergyParadox I'm curious how broke HIPPA regulations to even know about this medical info... Only fair to now have trump's physical (done by a doctor that isn't being paid by him) published to the world and oh ya let's just release those taxes as well...
@NancyPelosi he is such a spoiled obnoxious baby... he has to just keep trying to stir this up... But ya know don't engage that is what he wants... I do see your point and you are right...
@atDavidHoffman @EnergyParadox trump needs to be held on a mental hold in a straight jacket... for at least 2 yrs... and pence with him
@JamesKosur Is there any lower he can slither around through the U.S. trying to punish people for something they didn't ask for.??? he needs to go before he starts burning down orphanages on Christmas Eve...
@YaThinkN @Richard_D_Boyle @BelindaJones68 @Bishop64 https://t.co/U7E69K6KER
@Ironhorse76 @EnergyParadox That's a great idea... my son tells me that "he's the dad now" so I'm happy I'm not the only one... though I don't watch fox at all...
@ALT_uscis @CNN @wolfblitzer Everyone needs to drop these idiots like hot rocks...
@harveyjkaye That's a great idea...
@nytimes Not the one that was elected to...
@Acosta @DoctorRobin He's been doing that for over 70 yrs...
@JohnnyBlkshrt @MtnManMT6 That was his private campaign slogan... He couldn't wait. Putin helped though...
@VABVOX @wesing4blue Oh this is the best one...
@TruthChanges True...
@McFaul He didn't do well in private affairs either...
@PalmerReport So did his new hairdo from Sunday...
@TheRickWilson Yowza... LOL
@trcfwtt Sounds about right... I'm thinking after that it will be...		The Apprentice-Incarceration Season 1 of 10... Staring The Trump family, an assortment of unsupportive cast members, suck up senators and house members, the powerhouse Putin, MbS...
@funder @realDonaldTrump I'd like to see him get arrested at Mar a Logo and see him try to get away in his golf cart... And Mueller running up beside him and tackle him on the run... would be classic... and epic...
@PreetBharara That is awesome... I didn't know that could happen either???
@trcfwtt Touche'...
@socal_american And that could be tweeted by trump as early as tomorrow...
@TwitterMoments @kstreet111 With a tweet of course...
@Utleyjacobite @worm_castles Isn't it scary that all the MSM stations are saying the same thing except for those who are as clueless as trump...
@peterbakernyt Oh trump might as well send his personal jet to pick them up and then let them take the controls...
@mockumatrix @msrobin1502 @ida_skibenes I was too but then no good deed goes unpunished...
@Snarcastica @DavidCornDC OMGeezz... I didn't mean to make you spit water... I usually spit hot coffee out of my nose... that seems to be more brutal... LOL
@trcfwtt Why yes... yes you did... LOL
@JoeBiden @maggieNYT Ya but you aren't on the take from Russia...
@TomthunkitsMind @ImpeachmentHour Everything Trump touches Dies... @TheRickWilson  he called it long enough ago to have a book written, published and go on a book tour... 		He gets credit...
@SenDuckworth Today or tomorrow at the latest...
@SenDuckworth Tomorrow...
@marklevinshow @RichLowry Not for Putin...
@KatyTurNBC I think we all NEED something to drink after today... https://t.co/b6xDfgUMYr
@hardball @KenDilanianNBC The saving grace to the AG hiding the report is that Mueller can be subpoenaed to the hill and be asked questions under oath... LOL trump can run but he can't hide...
@trcfwtt While trump is there can we build a wall around him and disable his ability to get internet access so we don't have to see him on twitter again either???
@socal_american Beyond idiot... when trump going to where ever someone wants him (soon I hope) that he takes Cortez with him...
@jdawsey1 @Jill_Gregory Of course he is...
@DavidCornDC Until the end of twitter I imagine... I'm senile and I know that McCain has passed away...
@TeaPainUSA @lister_lester I think so too... his guy is gonna hand over the keys to the WH before the day is out...
@RabbiJill @Jill_Gregory @maddow Oh I know... I don't think she should take days off like today...
@rolandscahill @jdmoonchild I doubt it... Putin is gonna kick him to the curb with a mixed Putin Cocktail ... He is no longer useful to Putin... he'll be gone...
@StopTrump2020 Oh there is no way to pick this has been a politically $#itty day...
@CNN Dear Senators remember...		What would Nancy Reagan do??? 		JUST SAY NO!!!!! 		Don't let this happen... we don't need no stinking wall...
@neal_katyal Ya but ya gotta admit it could have been a reality... and may yet be... LOL
@RabbiJill Ah... I'll be ready with party supplies then... I've baked Lebkuchen, peanut butter and chocolate chips cookies... I have coffee ready... Will get the balloons ready too...
@JRubinBlogger @MichellesDude Just what Putin, MbS and Bashir wants...
@JeffreyGuterman Oh don't ask that... the last time I did after my knee needed to be replaced??? My ankle has torn tendons and required surgery... I asked again?? And now I have to have eye surgery... not a good thing to ask...
@thehill Misplaced humor along with misplaced loyalty to those who trusted LG to represent them. Instead he was playing footsie with trump and now it may come back and bite him in the @$$. He may know that putin will think him expendable...
@costareports @PrincessBravato He should run right out the door... he has not been loyal to the people of his state how can we trust him to be loyal to all of us...
@ananavarro OH he is just so stupid... I thought he might be coming to his senses in a few posts I saw earlier but putin is pulling marco's strings again... I really want to see financial audit on EVERY official that makes rules for our country..
@krassenstein @Pamforrest3 So ridiculous that they put all of this on Mattis... they should have been doing their jobs all along...
@MaryAnn26920610 @EvilBobJ @CNN Point well taken...
@jimsciutto Yup there's gonna be a party all weekend with these guys...
@BarneysNose That's what "Daddy Vladdy" told him to do... no telling what else putin told him to do in Helsinki...
@suzan5150 seems so...
@activist360 I would have to agree... utter chaos...
@treasonstickers @AnnCoulter I guess she grabbed him by the &amp;u$$y ...
@LindseyGrahamSC This is the Lindsey that was John McCain's friend... nice to have you back...
@chrislhayes We may not make it to February...
@IAmJoeTrudeau @realDonaldTrump I think I will personally start building the wall... the wall around him with no internet access ... he is inept and needs heavy medication. he is not fit for command of a monopoly game let alone the command of the free world...
@marcorubio Jump back on the titanic and save those who have elected all of the leaders not just you... everyone needs to act now because senators, representatives are not necessary to putin... he will sell you down the river just like the rest of us...
@PreetBharara This late in the game anyone who joins the trump tragedy team gets what they deserve... an irretrievable reputation...
@funder I agree...
@IAmJoeTrudeau @realDonaldTrump He sure does... if not I hope Canada can built a wall faster than we can come visit... long term...  I would like to laugh but it isn't funny...
@TheBeatWithAri @NancyPelosi Been something wrong with this picture from when trump slithered down the escalator... people who allowed this need to step up now and correct their horrible mistake before they are made expendable by putin...
@krassenstein He needs to not finish the day... senate needs to step in and stop this insanity... trump is not a leader... he is a putin puppet and we will all because Russian citizens if they don't stop trump now
@yashar Good... Schumer and the gang may be able to stop this insanity after all...
@BarneysNose It really is scary isn't it??? This could have all been prevented... but so many senators were sans spines...
@Acosta They can see how far below the surface that iceberg is so they are leaving the titanic... sadly the rest of us have to try to survive with this insane president.  This could have been prevented... might be too late to put country over party
@chrislhayes Well said...
@EvilBobJ @MaryAnn26920610 @CNN Don't understand why MSM keeps putting these guys on. Cuomo's we need to hear both sides might sound fair but really??? If we wanted to hear from them we could just check the trump twitter feed... Sanity has left almost every building from gvmt to MSM since trump hit the scene.
@MSarelson @TheRickWilson @DavidJollyFL I'll stand with you on this was well... and the U.S. shores are next...
@tombrokaw They better get a backbone when it comes to be "twitterpated" by trump and do what they were elected to do. If not they will become expendable with putin comes to move in to the WH that trump sold to him... putin will put trump behind "steel slats" too. Putin is not his friend
@mommamia1217 @myserenity69 @CNN Oh I think we are... he is the creepiest craziest next to trump I have ever seen...
@dumptrump33 Oh no... please tell me this is a joke... oh wait anything that is a joke is what trump will do next...
@shearm @realDonaldTrump Makes it easier for putin to come in and take over physically...
@PrincessBravato She is such a bimbo... I don't know how people like that get jobs like that... I'm smarter than that...
@bubbagump324 Someone has replaced all their meds with placebo or something they are all in need of a straight jacket and a rubber room...
@kaitlancollins @PrincessBravato Gee I can't imagine why???
@BillKristol @PrincessBravato I've been warning of this before he took office... I'm not anybody as so many of us that have been begging for those who can step in and take control... to do it... We the people have not been heard...
@andylassner @PrincessBravato Yup we need to buckle up... he's gonna drag us down his road to hell...
@TheRickWilson @MaryWilley8 Ya I think we need to make a run on the WH while he is in Mar a Logo and help him move...
@Acosta @PrincessBravato They all better take control now... before he tanks our country in less than two years... Make America Smart Again... #MASA
@shearm @McFaul @realDonaldTrump I would have just said		You're an @$$ and I'm not gonna help you drag this country down any farther...
@joshscampbell Yaaaa.... rriiiggghhhhtttt.... https://t.co/kSRulxvuW0
@davidaxelrod @realDonaldTrump He's a bit wordy actually... I would have been more blunt		YOU SUCK!!! I'm outta here...
@Acosta @CNNSitRoom So then why is it that trump thinks it's time others step up and fight isis now... he flips faster than anything on earth
@jimsciutto My prediction for replacement on the 20th day of December 2018 ~		Mike Pompeo...
@JohnBrennan Especially with Mattis out now... this is a nuclear button push away from the end of his insanity and our lives
@PaulLeeTicks The paint brush has the same movement that the tail of a hippo when it is scattering dung so it must be dung atop of "Dracmiller"'s head.. LOL
@PalmerReport Especially if trump takes charge of the money...
@PattyLehner 😐😐😐😐
@funder Comments like that should be an automatic trigger to have financials audited...
@thomaskaine5 @mmass214 I think we are right and he will drive the U.S. and anyone else into the ground until he is stopped...
@rolandscahill @MaryWilley8 Yep... frothing about the nose and mouth as he contemplates how to con people that he can be trusted with the funds...
@mockumatrix @ida_skibenes @msrobin1502 30 lbs since September??? That's not healthy... seek medical/psychology help soon... Very seriously...
@DeathNhd https://t.co/mdZNVQD5UP
@PaulLeeTicks @Stop_Trump20 If only that were true...  so should trump along with all the other idiots that have backed him...
@ABC trumpian antics are really gonna crash the market... and people voted for this...
@funder trump fever hits all of his appointees
@danpfeiffer Because that is what trump said that it was not a concrete wall but an artistically designed steel slat wall...
@MSNBC Let's start a gofundme for all the people who will be missing a paycheck... sort of an employee walkout or strike against this idiotic president.. let him try to hold us all hostage like he does little kids in cages...
@alpacafarmgirl2 @PalmerReport Thx... I want another reason to laugh at him... LOL
@TwitterNews @TwitterLive And how many have you smuggled in to work for your golf courses and you really need to learn to read...
@DearAuntCrabby Oh that's about right...
@IAmJoeTrudeau He is such a sleaze... he will regret it soon if he screws over the people for a wall...
@thehill Reminds me of his university escapade... con people even single parents that need food for their kids to buy into the program. Scamming people who think he is like them??
@JRCarrollNews @IAmJoeTrudeau @realDonaldTrump Oh I bet there have been...
@EdKrassen So I can't hardly walk to and from my bathroom... how in the hell am I supposed to work??? I'm a senior citizen and so he wants to take away part D when my meds to keep me alive is 3X my ss?? I worked since 14 and paid my dues. He was handed everything. He has no heart
@funder How about the vets, and the kids in poverty, medical needs, oh the list goes on...
@Stop_Trump20 A "Treach"... (trump/leach) I think you nailed it...
@PalmerReport I thought you were being funny... where do I find it... I need a good laugh...
@joshscampbell @replouiegohmert This woman is a disgrace to women, men, and anyone that has a heart and compassion. She belongs in a cage in the south TX border... if she can't walk the walk...
@SenJohnKennedy And presidents, VP's, senators, representatives, and anyone else who is running for elected office. And retroactive for all those in office now...
@HoarseWisperer I will go on there and donate... LOL
@krassenstein My son spent a yr in Iraq worst yr of my life so I don't want any sons/daughters at war but I also don't trust this decision made by someone who won't listen to those who know what this is about. He has no military exper. and his loyalty is questionable
@EdwardTHardy If I write a "suck up" letter to him do you think I could be his COS.... ?? or AG???
@JCTheResistance @doolbshoj @realDonaldTrump Good one... 🤣🤣🤣🤣 https://t.co/XKGQHqObyp
@trcfwtt And an addition to the already acquired $800K from the Russians... everyone's financials need to be audited... they are all on the take...
@trcfwtt I think so... but...		I don't really care... do u??? LOL
@trcfwtt Yep and those guys don't care they will find him...
@trcfwtt I think Daddy Vladdy or M bone saw might give him his just desserts before it's over with... he's starting to "outlive" his usefulness LOL
@trcfwtt I would like my ex better... and I didn't think I would ever hate any one more than the ex... but then along came trump... I have hated him from the late 70's when he was first being talked about in the media... he has always been a sleaze...
@trcfwtt I hope so as well...
@ultra_spicy Ich backe "Molten Macadamia Brownies" mit Nutella... sie sind sehr gut...
@trcfwtt 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 that's true... you did give it a great start then... LOL
@trcfwtt he really needs to read this... so he can see how bigly successful his presidency is... LOL
@FitzPatrickWalt @Jill_Gregory @realDonaldTrump And this one of @BarackObama visiting a Children's hospital and showing what a real president and person should be... https://t.co/prgvP3oatw
@McFaul But the Senate and House don't have the huevos to do anything about it...
Visiting a Children's hospital in D.C. now that's a president.. and good human being... 🎅🎅🎅🎅 https://t.co/ivAdODL2We

@gtconway3d @Popehat It's rudy It most likely is true that he said this...
@Popehat Way too funny but I have to ask if this is a joke because it sounds like something Rudy would say... https://t.co/HKv2NV2Uxb
@Dax_x98 We know of some Saudis that would help with that if he crosses MbS...
@renato_mariotti @_ReaalAmerican_ @realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle Because he knows more about ISIS than all the generals... he has a bigly brain...

@ReneeLibby2 When we blinked...
@LindseyGrahamSC Be careful Lindsey... you are about to redeem yourself...
@PreetBharara I don't think so either... paul will be busy counting his 1% raise in tax cuts er I mean pay... LOL
@BarneysNose Guess you won't need a biglier cottage after all LOL
@PreetBharara Hand over the keys to the WH???
@marcorubio Round up those who will save us from this and band together and stop this insanity...
@old_osc @KimTompkins14 @GOP @GOPLeader @LindseyGrahamSC @senatemajldr @SenatorCollins @marcorubio The Russian Money faucet will have to be turned off...
@siano2020 @rsmale Probably both because it applies....
@keanothedog @hazydav @MsActiviss Fair question...
@ReaganBattalion It was on "Daddy Vladdy's" Christmas list...
@PrincessBravato Another criminal investigation will be added to the list...		GoFundMe... LOL
Jingle Bells... Jingle Bells... https://t.co/gV0IHK73HI
@jimsciutto @JoyAnnReid his diversion from his criminal activities...
@PrincessBravato @TheBeatWithAri That's true...
@treasonstickers trump is trying to bury his criminal activities on the back page...
@JoeNBC @BarneysNose I want video of Santa pulling that down the chimney and putting under Christmas tree...
@KGSVMVMV @knotsinmyhair So true...
@alxstrda1396 Well I didn't say I wouldn't play "Cougar" or "Grand Cougar" I just won't cut someone slack if I don't like them. You know LOTR and Hobbit Characters,,, I would say favorite actors but they have all passed on except Kirk Douglas... https://t.co/A6xWFOthsK
@joshscampbell @AshaRangappa_ @washingtonpost "Daddy Vladdy" can make punishment pretty hard...

@RepSwalwell @lalden73093 PICK ME!!! PICK ME!!! PICK ME!!!
@Corgi_dad @MarkHertling @Kris_Sacrebleu "Daddy Vladdy"...
@lister_lester @CBSNews Yes he will... I think he's getting out before someone starts checking his financials... I think anyone who has been in politics should retroactively be audited... dems included. No prejudice... all of them kick those out who don't pass or have to be forced...
@funder @Pamforrest3 What "Daddy Vladdy" wants "Daddy Vladdy" gets and trump will see to it...
@McFaul Because "Daddy Vladdy" told him to or he won't get his allowance...

I'm making a bid to run for President... 		Of course I only have to beat out 49 other people running for office but I get to break up the votes so that the Republicans win again... Of course all Dems want trump to continue control over the US... https://t.co/5gOQuF7R4S

@ChasingOzPhotog @IloveFlorida001 I've been single since 1998 and I don't need anyone to complete me either. I don't have my Teddy Bear. He doesn't take out the trash, do dishes but I don't have to fight for the remote and I know where he was last night.
@mkraju @ReaganBattalion That's what he wants... he'll do anything to divert our attention to his criminal activities... he is such a sleaze...
@johnlundin Anything to divert our talking about his criminal activities...
@NBCNightlyNews She is awesome... @NewYorkStateAG  is a power house to bring people to justice...

@Mj_resistor @dmewing47 This is pathetic... he has no shame...
@hardball @HardballChris I'm thinking we should have a big nationwide party as he is hauled off to prison then kick anyone out that fails a financial audit and audit of rap sheet... Then start all over again.
@itsreallyalexb I so miss the Reagan quality of man... I can't imagine what he would say if he were here today...
@carlreiner It really is such a horrible sign of this admin. Can't wait til they are gone. Could be sooner than they think..
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump I agree... the senators from my state need to not vote for this nonsense either... I'm feeling like they should be dogged until they cry "Uncle" and do what is best for those of us who pay their salaries.. You are earning yours BTW I don't live in CA but you are amazing
@NBCNews Wow... that's just another way that trump has dragged down this country...
@TheRickWilson He might get 4 walls actually... complete with bars...
@CREWcrew Better go to the charity for the penalties and refunding all the money he screwed all the people he was supposed to be helping...
@Merbabe71 @Sulliview @ChrisCuomo I hope so... I have stopped watching CNN for those reasons right there... Arguing with a trumpite is like arguing with a pig... it drags you down in the mud and have to realize that the pig likes it...
@krassenstein No history class I have studied in 3 yrs at a university for a history degree has ever told of a president or admin is more corrupt...
@JillWineBanks I agree as you have experience on this subject... I saw you work on the Watergate trial... Quite impressive...
@ScreenCaffeen @kstreet111 @Sulliview Nothing would make me happier... her voice is like fingernails scraping across a blackboard...
@BarneysNose For the money... https://t.co/xygi7mbcVQ
@ahal79 @Fahrenthold @washingtonpost @realDonaldTrump He had one that Melanie (trump spellcheck there) was given the money out of the charity to buy and put in one of his golf clubs.. is such a sleaze I tried to cut her a little slack at first but she is in the same barrel of bad apples Hope Baron is like Tiff he's a better person.
@BillKristol the only artistically designed steel slats he will be truly be involved with will be when he is doing 8 to 10 in the "Pen"...
@CREWcrew Then they should quit... I'm sure everyone in the detail have pride in their work I don't see them having enough pride in this admin to work for free... no matter who is the admin no one should be working for free. This is trump's protection he better think about that...
@Emolclause @PollyPapaya @SenatorCollins @Comey @GOP She has already had her financials exposed as well as the hubby over Alaska... so she isn't worth our energy... she is another @GOP waste of space...
@dumptrump33 Even his voice... he makes me sick... as well as his family... (I give Baron and Tiffany a pass as they seem to be distant from this corruption)
@Stop_Trump20 I'm from Oregon... I believe in Bigfoot... but definitely not this admin... Bigfoot is at least honest...
@TheRickWilson I posted your bail... you just don't remember... LOL
@McFaul I'm worried that he had a plan with Putin for you as well... I don't trust these idiots I can't wait til they are out of office...
@Bakari_Sellers I'm not buying that one are you Bakari???
@joncoopertweets But he has the "bigliest" brain...
@BarneysNose He's trying to set up a "slush fund" he can use any way he wants to keep the government open... he is such a sleaze...
@SenJeffMerkley We also need you to put a NO to the slush fund in any form for the trump nonsense...
@CindibiseniusOr I'm afraid also that the year nor trump's presidency is not over yet either...
@josefsmith2011 @tommyxtopher @BrianKarem so that makes him "trumpoady"???
@PalmerReport And maybe the rest of the kids except Tiffany and Baron that is...
@Fahrenthold @washingtonpost @realDonaldTrump Don't buy his appraisal... I'll wait for an expert court appraiser to come in...
@FactsBalkan Yum... are there recipes that are authentic?? German recipes lose something in the taste when I have tried those. I had to go to authentic German recipes to get the right seasoning...
@VFHIVE @IAmJoeTrudeau NDA won't help with a Grand Jury or a Special Counsel...
@SenJeffMerkley Well here I come Senator. I am a constituent of yours and I see there is supposed to be a slush fund for trump. I'll be watching everyone for this. And you. I'm a recently jumped ship Republican and I want to make sure I'm not complicit anymore.
@seungminkim @IAmJoeTrudeau Time to move through with my promise to question my state dems to make sure this doesn't go through... let the emails, tweets and FB posts begin...
@SenJohnKennedy Check his financials since his trip to Russia...
@AriMelber Weisselburg has been really singing... I think we have a choir that doesn't want to spend more time in jail when trump will walk away or rather slither away and not have to be held accountable... If I'm wrong I'll admit it...
@AP And @GOP will fund this??? Oh PLEEAASSSEEEE!!!! he hasn't even figured out how to run his businesses how would he be able to handle anything in outer space???
@WiseWarrior69 @washingtonpost https://t.co/gLbJV6lw2E
@swggrkllr @treasonstickers Ewww... LOL https://t.co/PoGBh2esHN
@kaitlancollins @jdawsey1 #HereComeTheJudge ... https://t.co/ET4MN2DkLj
@CREWcrew There needs to be a rap sheet audit before people can take office, run for office and lets just check all their financials as well...
@nowthisnews @_ReaalAmerican_ Praise the Lord and send him the cash for this and probably a plane and/or palatial estate... Remember Flip Wilson... He called this years/decades ago... So now we all are seeing the #HereComeTheJudge https://t.co/o78pjVKBnX
Birds are smarter than the president and his homeland security as well as Pompeo... such a jerk... https://t.co/qXFShN2xD8
@atrupar @WiseWarrior69 He's cool... he arrives with appropriate signs to hold up with every traitor heading to court...
@washingtonpost @WiseWarrior69 And his base thinks this is okay... says so much for those who follow him...
@nytopinion @cristianafarias One person should not be able to make this decision... should be a few more judges involved...
@washingtonpost @WiseWarrior69 If he lied to the FBI...	LOCK HIM UP!!! LOCK HIM UP!!! LOCK HIM UP!!! LOCK HIM UP!!!
@latimes @WiseWarrior69 He is such a sleaze... so is Pomeo and anyone else that stands for this... not like there isn't medical evidence that she needs to see her child...
@robreiner @lskurrus That the World has never seen before...
@Helenhs For a mental excuse for all his wrong doing... to use unable to stand trial plea...
@TeaPainUSA I thought that was very telling as well...
@ProudResister @realDonaldTrump @GOP I think anyone in government right now that has been elected and received money for their campaigns need to have financials audited and check for rap sheet.
@icejackel2015 I start speaking German or Spanish...
@treasonstickers Oh I think this judge might still be on fire to put a traitor and someone who would have continued to commit treason, to be locked up right then and there...
@PalmerReport They came in to fit him for his jumpsuit and cuffs today???
@BillKristol Hey... You and your coworkers/owners have been in business for a while and you are going to be educating our young people and imparting your knowledge about true journalism...
@trcfwtt I don't... I think Flynn should be headed for the trump wing at the high security prison. But even then Putin and Erdogan will find someone who can smuggle a bone saw into high security...
@treasonstickers @AlanDersh Oh I think you are right... I think this corruption doesn't just go along with government... I think deviants are abound anywhere in the trump circle...
@myserenity69 Touche'... But you are funny... we need humor these days... our only saving grace...
@Rurba002 @myserenity69 Bankruptcy courts need to distribute this evenly... those company leeches have gotten so much money in their tenure than the workers time for people to be treated fairly. Pharma companies as well. Such a scam on the American People
@myserenity69 Why would you insult Ms. Piggy??? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
@GOVTWINE And that's on her good days...
@thehill Some people he just can't bully... Have to stand up to trump and his minions or they will tromp all over us...
@ReaganBattalion @TheRickWilson @JudgeJeanine Has she made enough money from covering trump that she has had some major "Nip 'N Tuck" work done??? She looks quite  a bit younger in this video
@Jim_Jordan @POTUS Not if Commander in Chief is guilty as well... the knew who was talking and who they were talking to... Russia...
@jaketapper Did she make it through the 4th grade???
@treasonstickers @realDonaldTrump Oh so many criminals so little prison space... Who's going to built and pay for that wall around the swamp??? I will put in $80 for that... but not a wall between Mexico and the U.S.
@UROCKlive1 @FBI Probably cuz trump is more guilty... trump and all these traitors need to slither back to the swamp that needs the "wall" around that. Serving 8 to 10 in the swamp...
@robreiner All of you kids were so funny and I didn't miss one show... Great comedy that we don't see these days. Watched Carol Burnett yesterday and laughed so hard at Tim Conway, and the rest of the cast... I so miss that kind of comedy so happy it is  on youtube
@ZemanLynnZ Oh I think he is neck deep in this... I hope we get live video when he reaches the Pearly Gates... God and Jesus will be ROFL so hard they won't even be able to open the gate let alone St. Peter
@DJPower007 @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump @POTUS What happened to the Red trees??? and where is Baron??? Never understood the leaving his kids out of the pic... However, I do have to agree... I think they should slither back to the swamp with the other scumbags
@GarrettHaake Someone is China said that a wall didn't help them...
@alxstrda1396 Well said... I have not met in my 62 yrs met anyone who was from Mexico that wasn't upstanding and hard working... if any of these people want to work in the fields to make sure we have fruits/veggies go for it. I've done it not as easy as they think
@DerekCressman @AllResistance She better be careful... those indictments and jail times are real... I hope she has 3 to 5 yrs childcare ready and waiting...
@Protect_Wldlife @westernmainecc @rickygervais Let's dope them up and turn them loose with a lion and for a sport lets not make it fenced... more than what the lion got... I'm a person who donates to the ALERT (African Lion &amp; Environmental Research Trust) program.  videos  if you want to watch Pride it was on Netflix
@ForeverLogical @VP @SpaceX Because our president is a "Space Case"????
@ForeverLogical @VP @SpaceX Check his financials and rap sheet...
@MacCocktail Rest in Paradise... such a great woman, actress, director and person... peace and comfort to her family...
@GeorgetteRain @VP @POTUS @DeptofDefense Read something the other day that said 	"When beings from other planets fly past the earth, speed up and lock their doors" 	Even other planets don't find intelligent leaders here on earth... 	In OR (my state) needs to step up or they will hate me before their terms are up
@angie_twotoo @Gerryfan @stevenportnoy IF she is indicted by all means we don't have evidence that stands up in a court ... I wouldn't say this about trump if he and his family hadn't been so complicit in so many things. trump is out of control and anyone that doesn't see that needs to look how you raise your kids.
@andylassner @IAmJoeTrudeau @GOP Well I guess I shouldn't mention that a cut like that is on what trump would grab... so that tells us what Miller is... another thing that trump will grab...

@Bdwal359 @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/9nHlb7mUZe
@Gerryfan @stevenportnoy I wish I was watching her in person right now as she watches the news... I'm not a hillary fan and wouldn't have voted for her but she deserves her days or years of glory after all the terrorizing trump has done to her...
@WhoKares34 @stevenportnoy I don't think you are wrong...
@bellvedere @stevenportnoy @Cernovich Imagine how terrorized the Cleric would have been if Flynn would have gotten away with this as well as now the trump admin. No one who has been safe in the U.S. for over 20 yrs should be sent to their death...
@activist360 But will the kids get indicted... and another indictment for the pres??? they should not be allowed to walk either...
@NicolleDWallace @nytimes Letitia has him on the run... they know she is going to continue that justice is served for the state of NY and will spill over into the presidency... we have a LE team all over trump;s books, businesses and he will flee to a country that will take him. Probably not Russia or SA
@PalmerReport Not just his kids goin' down... he is gonna end up in the "slammer" as well...(thought it went well with his rat comment) he just keeps digging in "deeplier and deeplier" everyday...

@HuffPost Welcome to America 2017-2021... we will all need medical care and lots of Xanax to make it through these next two years...
@ReutersPolitics SC should yank his agreement and put him in the trump wing at the nearest prison... he is a traitor and sold out our country for $$$$... that makes him a "manwhore"... He needs a little makeup touch up... trump can help him with that...
@billmaher @ColMorrisDavis Forgot spineless...
@ellievan65 Audit his financials... everyone from this day forward should have to do that... and those who are in office now... if not... (if I didn't take a drug screen as a truck driver I didn't have a job) they shouldn't have a job either... Even in the WH...  especially the WH
@Acosta Ya'll need to stop giving him a platform...
@IAmJoeTrudeau I'd vote for that...
@mkraju Says the man on the take from the Russians... who jumped out of a car and took info to the president in the middle of the night... ya that was on the up and up too...
@KarenRenete @EdKrassen I will get up the resistance party and we will find you and rescue you...
@BarneysNose Someone the other day asked if I only responded with gifs... I was hoping it wasn't you cuz I just did it again LOL
@OkCallMeAL I think we should round them all up and ship them along with the whole admin and their families and drop them off on a deserted island... NO INTERNET!!!!
@h0n3y_73 @myserenity69 He garners such trust in American politics right now...
@EvilBobJ @CNN Neither does Kellyanne...

@ThomasB00001 @KatGodspell He should have been as smart as he tells people... he could have pretended to be a good president like he was on a tv show and no one would have gone this far... mess with people who know how to find out your sins... you get burned... go directly to help do not pass go

@nnativepride Are you the artist???
@_ReaalAmerican_ @NewYorkStateAG I'm not one of those grandparents that have lived that tragedy but I'll take a few pot shots for them... I really am law abiding until this happens. I was devastated when I woke up 6 yrs ago today it was a sad birthday... but never so devastating as the families day.
@regan11218lane OH I switched parties after this past pres election but I'll go after Dem politicians too. They all need to have financials checked. I thought it was wrong that Mitt was supposed to talk about his off shore accounts... until now... if you can't be transparent don't run 4 office
@NewYorkStateAG @_ReaalAmerican_ What is wrong with people??? This is so wrong.. parents at schools especially those what have been terrorized by gunfire don't need this... If found this person should go to jail...

@4YrsToday @mmass214 I would bet does in the sense that you can smell him a mile away... but if you mean is he legit... NO NO NO
@AP_Politics @eschor @jmsummers It's a matter of representing all people if she intends to be a president... Not just the AA constituents and as far as I know I haven't heard she has spent time at the reservations for any native americans but I would like to know if I am wrong

@johnupshaw82 @_ReaalAmerican_ @SenJohnKennedy @CBP_McAleenan I liked him and the things he said on some subjects (I'm not from LA though) but after July 4th in Russia he has been  a totally different person... Audit Financials... I smell rats
@Jill_Gregory It will be glorious won't it??? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
@RoArquette @KassandraSeven I would... but I would a shorter timer than the mooch.. about 1 minute I would be dragged out by security and cuffed... My shining glory...
@DearAuntCrabby @Pajjr2016 https://t.co/iPN5XQ3jDs

@BarneysNose https://t.co/DTDCsRqVCz
@kitchen5203 @TeamPelosi I voted for her years ago when I lived in CA... don't remember the year though. I switched to rep... and after this trump nonsense I switched back... I am going to stick with those who show they care... My own state representatives and senators will hate me before it's over...
@TeamPelosi @kitchen5203 Go get 'em Girl... You showed your true abilities this morning... I'll side with you anytime. I didn't think you would make a good leader... but you changed my mind.
@ImJohnEli WE better find one soon. Didn't he send a couple of fighter planes to Venezuela...
@SusanWi40144544 I can't either...
@Pajjr2016 Oh putin will find him no matter where he goes at this time... too much flipping for putin's good...

@TheRickWilson I'm sure she will be invited for cocktails...
@ImJohnEli Important enough to repeat... LOL

@brycetache It was epic... and she walked out of the WH with style and class... and I didn't even like her before today... LOL
@ImJohnEli @NancyPelosi Oh that's part of her charm.. 👌👌👌👌
@RepAdamSchiff @weaverwarren1 Oh pick me!!!  pick me!!!!  I would be next in line to hand him his head... if @NancyPelosi  leaves enough to hand to him... 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Oh wait I worked for the FBI... I don't qualify...
@TeamPelosi @t4d09 If she keeps this up I'll have to have her name tattooed on my other shoulder...
@CillizzaCNN @KatGodspell If I weren't on blood thinners I would have it tattooed across my shoulder...
@funder Oh Lord I will never watch porn again if you get me outta here... without @NancyPelosi coming after me... LOL
@thehill It wasn't a Hispanic, legal or not, that shot him while playing baseball... I'm for border safety as well but this multi-billion dollar one up for his manhood is ridiculous...
@kylegriffin1 https://t.co/Ypvwpp6qHz
@jaketapper @mkraju But trump is such a screwed(🙄) business man how did he let those dumb dems goad him into that???
@ImJohnEli Send in @NancyPelosi and hope they make it out alive... she will chew them up and spit them out... I think she was being "polite" on camera... I don't want to pi$$ her off in private... https://t.co/hniC7mZErr

@politico Seems they forgot the one that was most important... @NancyPelosi she slapped him into his next twitter tantrum...
@JCSO_Oregon That's great...
@Nicoxw1 So did the kid that mowed the lawn...
@EdKrassen he was outsmarted by a dem... I love it... they both slapped into his next twitter tantrum...
@McFaul @maddow I'm gonna take a wild guess and say... YES!!!!

@alex_nman https://t.co/07HQKkt1UT
@joncoopertweets Let us pray....
@ABCPolitics He's going home to count his 30 pieces of silver so he doesn't care any more than trump about the national debt... he won't be here...
@alex_nman https://t.co/jBWCU8bKjk
@senatemajldr He must have his thumb in a hemp "pie" somewhere... what do ya wanna bet???
@krassenstein OMGeezz... I guess they have to see his smocking gun in his hand these senators are the ones that are dumber than rocks...
@SRuhle @senorrinhatch He is on his skis heading downhill to senility...
I think there needs to be pictures and crayons included but maybe one of trump's aides will read it to him if they are brave enough... https://t.co/TM5lZoaEeE
@DistinguishDigi True... I think all the wandering around and forgetfulness will be used as a defense to not be put in jail...
@ImJohnEli Oh I think he would have because he thought no one would catch him because he has such a yuge brain...
It's hard to say.. 🤣🤣🤣🤣 https://t.co/JaEmTSIoBb
@socal_american Hilarious... https://t.co/UTYsszhnO0
@mikerblackman @jcatwindsor https://t.co/HHrCHo7enT
@Bru__ce @washdcbhl Audit his financials...
@georgiainoregon @billiebrown41 https://t.co/Cb6OfT6tHO
@McFaul Oh what tangled webs we weave...
@leeleeb50 @IloveFlorida001 I don't think this is what he had in mind... LOL https://t.co/SdxXBGcPbe
@h8Wankmaggot45 i.e. sanity, stress and biting your nails... LOL
@atrupar In a corner curled up in a fetal position because no one wants to play at his house anymore...
@SRuhle I think everyone's financials need to be audited... seems so many people are crooks these days...
@rgoodlaw @B52Malmet @RepAdamSchiff Financials need to be audited... all of them... dems and reps alike... I want to be fair...
@McFaul he is so pathetic...
@davidmweissman yay...
@ReneeLibby2 https://t.co/RhhZWTvhKW
@ImJohnEli You would think...
@SaysHummingbird My battle cry "CHECK THEIR FINANCIALS" 👌👌👌👌
@PrincessBravato These guys are hilarious... Gotta love the genre of music as well... 🤣🤣🤣🤣
@davidfrum He doesn't know how to offer valuable help...
@tribelaw True...
@matthewamiller @IAmJoeTrudeau Agree...
@RWPUSA @Frenchy2460 Oh that's hilarious... Kava-beer said anything he could to become a SCJ and now looks like he is not gonna do what he promised trump...
@PalmerReport He will resign by noon??? 👌👌👌👌
@waltshaub @CindibiseniusOr https://t.co/b8ZHKGe5bo
@peterdaou As someone who sews the only thing I can figure out is that it bunches up material to make a puffy appearance to material for a little girl's dress... so much like a nail gun for puffy action. Nail gun +puffy= trump's puffy @$$ gets nailed to the wall with luck for U.S.
@EdwardTHardy Well of course the dept is...??
@GrassrootsSpeak Oh definitely... I think that SC has that info right now I just hope we get to see the traitors as well...
@ImJohnEli He who laughs last...
@_die_kat__ @LolainPause Ich auch...
@BarneysNose https://t.co/K033w7Ur1B
@PalmerReport Smocking is a way of gathering up small pieces of material on a little girl's dress to make it look puffy... I don't see where using a "smocking gun" would be effective...
@leeleeb50 @DoctorRobin As someone who has been sewing for almost 50 yrs I would love a smocking gun... I just don't see how trying to shoot a decoration onto a little girl's dress???
@davidhogg111 This was before he was bought off by Putin...
