I‚Äôm 65 &amp; love America. In all my years I‚Äôve never heard so much talk of Socialism. Everday, countless mice die because they don‚Äôt understand why the cheese is ‚Äúfree.‚Äù More folks get into &amp; suffer &amp; die in Socialism for same reason.

I‚Äôve been thinking:	If Donald Trump deleted all of his emails, wiped his server with Bleach bit and destroyed all of his phones with a hammer, would the Mainstream Media suddenly lose all interest in the story and declare him innocent? ü§î Probably not. They hate him so bad!...rw

The 75th anniversary of D-Day is coming up in June. Those brave, young soldiers knew their cause, they knew who they were there to help. Their story is one of courage and bravery. POTUS is right‚Ä¶They knew America had to prevail. Good always triumphs over evil.

Dems can‚Äôt even clap for the idea of being born free and founded on liberty and independence? That we will never be a socialist country? Hmm‚Ä¶

Thank YOU, @realDonaldTrump for addressing the atrocities that occurred in the New York and Virginia legislators in recent weeks. ALL life is precious, and I, too, will never stop working to protect the unborn.
American freedom has allowed for scientific advances in HIV/AIDS, childhood cancer, &amp; more. We will not stop until these diseases are eliminated. I can‚Äôt help but think of the kindness shown by Former First Lady Barbara Bush and our local hero &amp; childhood cancer survivor, Mia.

On the floor now, debating my bill H.R. 4378!  The research reactor, or Versatile Neutron Source, authorized in that bill is crucial for the development of advanced reactor designs, materials, and nuclear fuels.
Minority Leader Pelosi appears to be attempting to filibuster on the House Floor. Trying to derail the budget deal? If she is successful in her endeavor &amp; Govt shuts down: instead of another Schumer Shutdown; it will be SchumerShutdown2 aka: #PelosiPlunder
I hear that Jimmy Morales: President of Guatemala is following our great Pres Trump‚Äôs lead &amp; recognizing Jerusalem as the Capitol of Israel. Bravo for him! Would that other countries‚Äô leaders have same fortitude! Thank You President Trump for your leadership! #therealdonaldtrump
‚ÄúFreedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same.‚Äù	Wise words... Ronald Reagan would have turned 107 today. Happy birthday, Gipper!
D‚Äôs are at it again! Are we about to witness another Schumer Shutdown? #SchumerShutdown-V2.0
.@RepClayHiggins and I are safe. Praying for all involved and anxiously awaiting more news...
.@POTUS gave an incredibly powerful #SOTU Plenty of memorable moments from tonight. No better time for a twitter moment ‚Üí‚ö°Ô∏è ‚Äú2018 SOTU‚Äù	#SafeStrongProud		https://t.co/xdLDxw6fNZ
Trump: ‚ÄúProtect Americans because Americans are dreamers, too.‚Äù Did the D‚Äôs stand? Course not. Sad, huh? It is time to put America first! I‚Äôve been saying that for over 6 years! Where do the D‚Äôs loyalties lie? #SchumerShutdown. Thank GOD we‚Äôve got Donald Trump. #PutAmericaFirst
President says fix the border so gangs can‚Äôt get in &amp; Americans won‚Äôt be murdered. D‚Äôs won‚Äôt even stand for that. #Speechless
POTUS says gangs come thru open borders- D‚Äôs groan. They deny criminals are coming thru open borders. Yep...#BumpsOnLog or worse #BlindEyeTurners
He talks about lifting from welfare to jobs &amp; independence: Yet you guessed it...#BumpsOnLog
Safe, fast, reliable, modern infrastructure. Our economy needs it. Our people deserve it. There's a serious problem when permitting takes longer than building, &amp; by the time a structure is built we have outgrown it. America is a nation of builders. Let's get to it.
President Trump wants $1.5 Trillion Infrastructures bill... yet... You guessed it...#BumpsOnLog
President cites successes of auto manufacturers back in the USA. D‚Äôs can‚Äôt even applaud that... sad...#BumpsOnLogs
‚ÄúThis is in fact our new American Moment‚Äù President Trump. Yet, the D‚Äôs sit there. Bumps on a log. #NewAmericanMoment
The Individual Mandate was crippling. With #TaxCutsAndJobsAct, that mandate is repealed. The core of Obamacare is gone. Healthcare should be patient-centered, physician-supported, and market-based. Period.
President cites lowest unemployment rate: Blacks &amp; Hispanics, says we have doubled standard deduction for couples so that first $24,000 of their wages are tax free. R ‚Äòs leap to feet to applause &amp; the D‚Äôs sit there like ‚Äúbumps on a log‚Äù I hope Americans remember come election.
Sitting on House Floor. SCOTUS just entered. Waiting on the President. Watching Jeff Flake is on the dais speaking to Vice President Pence &amp; Speaker Ryan. How‚Äôd yah like to be a fly on that wall? Undoubtedly talking about how Arizona has prospered under Trump. You think? #MAGA
2.4 million new jobs...Small business confidence at an all-time high...Unemployment at an all-time low...Stock market records...This is GREAT news for Americans!		#TaxCutsAndJobsAct is providing TREMENDOUS relief for the middle class and small businesses. -@POTUS #SOTU

Schumer lectured Trump. Really? Senate D‚Äôs shut down govt over a fake deadline. They chose to adversely affect lives of law-abiding citizens, put our troops in harms way &amp; jeopardize health insurance for 9 million kids. Simple - you can‚Äôt hold Americans hostage.
Sent this letter earlier today. #SchumerShutdown withholds pay from our brave military men and women. This is uncalled for.		Standing with our troops...GOD bless them! https://t.co/ZsdE9reiVj
In the Senate, 60 votes are needed to pass a bill of this nature. There are 51 Rs. The individual aspects of the bill have bipartisan support, but Senate Ds voted against 6 yr CHIP reauth, the military, &amp; funding the government.	Senate Ds shut down the government...why?
We need to separate politics from policy, and focus on the priorities and deadlines at hand. We have a job to do.
Last night Senate Ds had a choice ‚Äì fund CHIP, provide tax relief, support the military, &amp; keep the government open. They chose shutdown. They voted against children, against the military, &amp; against our country. This is outrageous. This is unacceptable.
ICYMI: Republicans supporting the ProLife Event today. Speaker Ryan did an incredible job! Did you see any D‚Äôs on the stage? Would that the Democrat Party cared as much about the unborn as they seem to care about children who were brought into the country illegally. Disgraceful! https://t.co/rr96MIgy70
What a difference Trump is making. Remember October 2013? Obama &amp; Reid said they would not negotiate with Republicans over the CR! President Trump is engaged &amp; working to keep the government open! Senate D‚Äôs better sit up &amp; take notice! Americans sure are!

We‚Äôd love to see tax reform enacted ASAP. 31 years is far too long. Let‚Äôs get 90% of Americans filing their taxes on paper the size of a postcard.
Tax reform brings the opportunity for over 900,000 new jobs. Corporations want to be back in the US.	If tax reform were on the backs of Middle Class America, I wouldn‚Äôt be for it.
Talking social security and taxes with Lynda. Thanks for the question and your hard work!

guns are not the enemy #sotu
Obama wants to limit 2nd amendment freedom... Mr President: here's a fact: Guns don't cause crime anymore than computers cause porno.#sotu.
#POTUS executive orders are not the answer. He should be working with Congress. #SOTU
Obama says his administration has kept Congress informed bout terrorism operations... Has he forgotten Benghazi? Or was it a film? #sotu.rw
Now Obama wants to dictate to businesses what they have to pay... Hmmm... He must think he's a dictator... Sad huh? #sotu
Let's get more boots on the ground and secure our border #sotu
The govt's 1st involvement that caused housing bubble burst wasn't enough, Obama wants to wade back in. Relax rules... He's a slow learner
lower taxes and less regulations will help our job creators #SOTU
We need to fix the debt first #POTUS - #SOTU
Obama says if Congress won't act, he will. Another end around Congress is on its way. For a lawyer he sure doesn't know our Constitution!
combat climate change? I hear more burdensome regulations from the EPA #SOTU #morejobs #lessregulation
Let's put political differences aside...couldn't agree more #POTUS...APPROVE the Keystone Pipeline already #SOTU
