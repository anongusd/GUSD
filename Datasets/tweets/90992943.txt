@jfslowik @cnoanalysis However I’m glad you offered suggestions at the end on how to be a supportive ally and peer and I do feel personally like you’re a cheerleader for me and my work and would have my back on anything so thank you ✨
@jfslowik @cnoanalysis Infosec lives on twitter. Tweeting stuff is bad shows you care and won’t take shit IRL. Also, how often are people presented with these situations in which to act in defense of the target? Most dudes I talk to are shocked by my stories which suggests they don’t often witness it
@jfslowik @cnoanalysis Using “thoughts and prayers” as an example of your point is not totally fair because that’s a phrase people say while avoiding taking a stance (yay/boo) one way or another on gun violence
@jfslowik @cnoanalysis applying this to my personal life: I tweet that stuff is bad and also donate money to causes I care about, volunteer on campaigns, march and advocate for better solutions and against hateful rhetoric. You can do both.

@jowens510 @lorakolodny Oh yes I think Oakland is also cool to explore. I just mean the bubble of conference zones
@jowens510 @lorakolodny I dunno I think it’s nice to go outside of bubbles
I say this as someone living in SF, where many folks have a very narrow view of our city due to conferences all taking place in one spot. There are def problems and we don’t do enough to take care of our most vulnerable. But it’s also a beautiful, fun, and delicious city.
A good goal for 2019: Explore cities outside of the area where conferences take place. 		-San Francisco, explore the Sunset and Golden Gate Park!	-Las Vegas, leave the strip and maybe go hiking!

when have companies actually faced any real, significant consequences for data breaches/disclosures though? every time this happens politicians et al write letters and make threats and then...well, not a lot. https://t.co/jzegCIkTkk
@ClaireTills also i think it has something to do with corporations never being held appropriately accountable for really anything. so outrage can seem futile.
@ClaireTills yeah..i wonder if it's breach fatigue or just having so many other things to be outraged about?
Anyways, it doesn't matter if it's 500 million or one person whose information gets stolen, it sucks and feels bad regardless. We should all try to be compassionate and help educate people and attempt to make the world a little safer and better as best we can.
There are humans and individuals behind credit cards and emails and data and I feel like the individual human aspect of security is often forgotten in favor of highlighting increasing numbers of potential anonymous victims.
Any time a data breach happens, a lot of folks are like "oh another data breach, everyone's stuff is out there anyway" and focus on large numbers and data as if there are not people behind them.

RT @kyleehmke: As promised, here are my #CYBERWARCON slides. Thanks for attending and all the great questions! https://t.co/aHNQ7WRX6t
“Having a partnership with journalists could be beneficial to ID what orgs are worth looking into..” anyways really excellent talk from @kyleehmke
Wonder how the FB folks in the audience feel about that mention (he noted the group was in the news recently for their work with the social network)
Ooh @kyleehmke presented on his (excellent) work tracking IRA info ops and ends by noting that by using registrant email domain and google analytics you can ID fake Tim Cook election site, sites advocating to build the border wall among other various sits created by Definers PR
Good point here and also good points in this thread. I remember when senators started really pushing the narrative that IRA ops constituted cyberwar https://t.co/xyxNlIeAzX
@cnoanalysis @likethecoins Also defining info ops generally as cyberwar while also calling things like cyber-enabled blackouts cyberwar etc etc is just confusing and dilutes any attempts to define what the word means
Obligatory shoutout to my colleague @jfslowik who has talked about behaviors and attribution a lot including recently in this post about cozybear (maybe) https://t.co/RWhz69rmI0
The primary goal of behavioral profiling is not attribution. It’s to generate hypotheses to narrow nominal pools and build testable profiles says @juanandres_gs at #cyberwarcon
RT @jfslowik: For those at #cyberwarcon Kaspersky mention of RU-linked "Hades" was publicly made here: https://t.co/ApqsOQuN6y
Really great talk on Chinese info ops at US universities and the ways China is encouraging talent and research to go to China through $$$ https://t.co/ZaH3DjWtj0
irl lol at @Adam_Cyber’s final slide from his talk “Behind the next Destructive Attack” #cyberwarcon 		“My gift to you” he says https://t.co/AmkVYXbfX7
Instagram is a major platform for Iranian disinformation campaigns targeting civil society members (which is a platform often not considered/discussed as kuch when talking about social media operations). @SiminK_ #cyberwarcon
I was not expecting to learn how basic economics and cost-benefit analyses apply to various malicious activity/cyberattacks #cyberwarcon https://t.co/LNAE8AqTDE
@k_sec’s brief overview of RU-speaking APTs #cyberwarcon https://t.co/T9njJ3xvw2
OK I asked but this is not their specialty (these women are focused on Iran and Russia) and they just referenced previously mentioned policies. They said domestic disinfo ops will also be dealt with if identified but not much more #cyberwarcon
The talk is focusing mostly on stuff that’s already public and def western/US focused, curious if they’ll talk about the Philippines or explicitly state-backed disinfo ops 👀
Differences in info ops:	Iran may focus more on political objectives, whereas Russia focuses on sowing discord and chaos. 	All use the platform differently.	Using one known operation to detect another doesn’t work (which can be said for other areas of security ofc) #cyberwarcon
FB threat intel folks talking about lessons learned from disrupting info ops: partnerships are critical, increased transparency and lead to greater deterrence, investigating IO can lead to finding other violations like spam etc. #cyberwarcon
Something like this would be valuable for the government to include when discussing the feasibility of their deterrence policies. And politicians pushing “hack back” legislation #cyberwarcon https://t.co/e8wbCwjQlm
RF: Houthi government is using cryptocurrency mining to make money for the regime. 973 coinhive hosts are on the Yemennet IP space. (Another regime that mines crypto for $$$? NK)  #cyberwarcon
RF: Getting access to internet &amp; changing control of the infrastructure has followed the conflict in Yemen. In the last year they’ve seen adware and spyware and a big increase in VirusTotal samples, mostly android-based, &amp; increase in Chinese apps and malware #cyberwarcon
Shoutout to @RecordedFuture for kicking off their talk on cyberattacks in Yemen by mentioning the importance of diversity and inclusion in the threat intel space ✨ #cyberwarcon
FUD bad, do not FUD 	#cyberwarcon
@WylieNewmark on electric grid FUD:	Adversaries harness psychological effects for influence purposes to a wide variety of audiences	-public who doesn’t understand how grid works	-poor communication from related / relevant entities	-media misinterpretation
It was really interesting to see how much the media was part of the different leaks convos. With #dopingleaks there was virtually no media engagement vs DCLeaks where media made up 34%. (Based on @camillefrancois’s data and graphs) #cyberwarcon
@camillefrancois gave a ~very interesting~ talk on false leaks and different network, semantic, and temporal relationships. She shared a disinfo data sharing and research platform: https://t.co/2sboCVomOz for anyone interested.
Now I am extremely excited for @RidT’s next book.
@RidT: the forgery helped articulate a fear many people had (Soviet Union furthering/supporting communism in the US) &amp;turned it into an info op. Most effective way to run these campaigns is to take something “accurate and has emotional resonance and run with it.” #cyberwarcon
A congressional committee was created to investigate. But an investigative reporter dig into it and found it was actually printed in NYC 🤔 it was exposed as a “White Russian” forgery designed to undermine recognizing Russia. #CYBERWARCON
Kicking off with a history lesson from @RidT: in 1930 the NYPD chief Whalen published a letter allegedly from the Soviet Union instructing a Soviet trade org to escalate communist tensions and demonstrations in the city. #CYBERWARCON

"While XENOTIME is concerning, these capabilities and a playbook for executing them now exist. Even if there were substantial tech indicators to share, they’d be kind of useless. It’s not about blocking hashes," it’s about comprehensive security measures. @jfslowik
Q: Should ICS devices never be internet-connected? 	@jfslowik: In perfect world, ICS devices will never hit the internet...but that’s not the case. Don't let perfect (not connected) be the enemy of the good—use well architected and secure systems using best security practices
Q: What's the most surprising thing found during research?	@jfslowik: Hard question, but it's surprising that someone took the time to develop and deploy malware to target a safety system. That’s a dirty move.
@frankpallotta wow yeah that's embarrassing
@danms0 omg
Assuming an SIS compromise has taken place, important questions to consider: Can you ID it was a cyber attack? What’s your plan for restoration? Do you have backup and failover plans that would allow continuing operations if an SIS is compromised?
Random thought I always have: Mimikatz is such a cute name like awww evil lil kitty
important reminders:	- implement 2FA where possible 	- standard AV won't catch ICS-specific threats	- typical security scanning could ID tools used in breach
ICS defenders need to work with IT security to identify attacks that may be of interest to ICS owners/operators. i.e. ICS themes in phishing, ICS-related personnel targeting. Coordination between IT/ICS security is crucial
We can’t rely on “indicators” because ICS attacks, specifically TRISIS, are unique to targeted environments. Indicators from one site will not be applicable to others explains @jfslowik. Focus should be on adversary behaviors
XENOTIME AG intrusion methodology: 	- Use credential capture and re-use to pivot	- Leverages custom tools, common scripts, and system commands	- Capable of developing &amp; deploying SIS malware
"TRISIS is designed...will not work on any other platform," as it was tailored specifically for Schneider Electric Triconex systems @jfslowik explains. Future XENOTIME activity targeting SIS would have to be customized for specific safety systems.

Everyone has to invest more in this space, @RobertMLee says, and leaves us all with: 		"Do more, fear less."
If you haven't yet, check out the Dragos Year in Review on 2017 ICS vulnerabilities. Across all ICS vulns, for over 64% of vulns if you patched them, it didn't eliminate any risk, 72% provided no alternate mitigation to the patch (shoutout to @ReverseICS) https://t.co/JhV4JbiCrx
"Blockchain is stupid, welcome to RSA!" lolol I think that means I can fill a bingo square or something
TRISIS was a huge deal—it targeted the safety system and could have knowingly caused loss of human life. The attackers could have taken down the plant in easier ways than reverse engineering the safety system, says @RobertMLee. Here's @DragosInc's report https://t.co/WsxfyQzSSr
Rob poses a good question about misattribution, misreporting or hype around ICS threats: How do people respond and follow up after erroneous reports when they're like "oops, I guess we got this wrong, sorry"
In the next few years we are going to see the threat landscape look like it's hockey sticking. Yes, they're increasing but *also* we're now looking for them so we'll see more than we have historically. @RobertMLee
The ICS threat landscape is still mostly unknown. "We are not collecting data or doing analysis to determine root cause."
Industrial infra is extremely defensible. "The threats are worse than we realize, but not as bad as we want to imagine."
"Hype has costs," @RobertMLee says. Snowballing inaccurate or hyped up information about ICS threats can lead to inappropriate reporting / discussions / difficult incident response.

Making people feel dumb about taking a silly quiz years ago is an unproductive response. Use it as an opportunity to help people better understand how Facebook and other apps/companies use and collect data.
