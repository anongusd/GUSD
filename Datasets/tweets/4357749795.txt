@senatemajldr You sir are the biggest Dirtbag I have ever seen. You will reap what you sow. I feel sorry for you actually.
@realDonaldTrump I have an idea, why don't you become the First President of all time to switch parties in the middle of your term, I mean why not, you switched to run for president it is only fair

@realDonaldTrump Look below I dare you to find very many if any who still support you
@realDonaldTrump I just have one question, if you are as great as you think you are then why are there so many properties with your name on it trying to get rid of your name?
@AOC I am with you all the way, you go!
@sbullockweb  Hi, I have admired you throughout your career, thank you for being so entertaining. You would be my dream date if I still dared to dream about dates. you are almost perfect in everyway. I hope you are like that in real life
@realDonaldTrump I truly wish you actually believe what you say. If you were to get off the wall and try to work with someone other than your base, which is sad, there might have been hope for you. So very Sad that it is too late for you to turn things around.
@realDonaldTrump You are so Sad!
@RepAndyHarrisMD 2 of 2  That is going to weigh very heavily on me and my family and friends decisions the next time you come up for election.  The story I read about a lawsuit against an activist, wow. republican all the way
@RepAndyHarrisMD  I tried to email you, but I got some nonsense that I need to provide the zip code + 4.  So I will make this public.  I am one of your constituents and I am disappointed in finding out you are against Cannabis reform.  1 of 2
@VolusiaSheriff @SheriffChitwood Damn I hate some white people, and I am one...
@realDonaldTrump LOL, maybe that is because the public actually knows better than to listen to the Republicans.  I used to be republican, can't do that anymore and have a clear conscience.  Maybe you should try switching...Again
@realDonaldTrump Dear Sir, why do you live in this fantasy world, where you have done nothing wrong? Very Sad that you do. Wake up and listen to something other than the FOX, Breitbart, ect news.  Fo the love of our country, and the sanity of our people, go away and take Pence with you
@GOPChairwoman LOL you are so funny, #StacyAbramsisgreat
@george_capen Improvement, not hardly.  I had two deductions taken away, you can't deduct the cost of a home office or deduct the cost for filing.  .
@kcd728 you can't even deduct the cost of the tax software, or take a deduction for small office work at home..;
@scottwongDC @AOC Sad way of thinking about things. put the Veteran Democratic Lawmakers name out here, maybe they are the one who needs primaried?
@realDonaldTrump #TrumpResign #TrumpResignNow #ImpeachTrumpPenceNow #Trumpneedstogo I hope you are getting the picture! It is way past time for you to call it quits. #saveAmericafromTrump
@realDonaldTrump Donald, can I call you Donnie? you really turn me on. I think you must be the handsomest President of all times. really, I mean that. You are smart, have a Huge brain, and I have heard your hands are not really that small. Anyway, I would really like to meat you.
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi So stupid and what's worse is you Sarah help him
@realDonaldTrump I want to know just one thing.... Do you listen to the replys or do you just go ape shit after you you tweet something?
@realDonaldTrump Donnie, you are missing something	go find it
I have an Idea, spend some money on the toilets in south Africa, two five year old children have lost their lives because they fell in and drowned in an open pit toilet. Could you imagine a worse way to die?
Sir,when it is all said and done,and your time as president comes to an end, do you really want to go down in history as the one who divided this great country.History books can be harsh. Do the right thing now! We are a world of many peoples. they will be here when you are gone.
Look at how many tunnels have been built.. Look at the Rio grande river.. give it a break already with the wall. YOU! are tearing the country apart and after your presidency you will have to live with it for the next few years. When the Good lord decides it is time, you are done
Donnie, please get off the wall. It will not work. you are a business man from what I have heard. The wall make absolutely no sense at all. This is a new world. We use Drones to find our enemies get founding for drones not a wall. move you 70+ year old into the present and future
NO Wall, No Wall, No Wall, We need no Frickin WALL! do you understand?
How can you possibly live with yourself? I mean seriously, a dog that licks his own ass is better than you.
You are absolutely one embarrassing POS.
God Bless the American Troops and Down with Commander in Chief Bone Spurs.. Hope you daddy is happy
You are one SOB, I saw the patches on the Soldiers you went to visit, I was there when that same unit, the same patch I worn, liberated Al Asad Air base.  I am proud to say that I met Obama there shortly after we took over.  But now, to have you disgrace that memory is horrifying
Merry Christmas to you and your family.  God tells us to forgive, I am trying but I don't think it will happen in your case. Maybe he will have mercy on your soul, it is up to him alone
I hope this is not another Christmas Carol in the making. (3 of 3)
(2 of 3) and after you do think about the others you have displaced due to greed and wanting so much to be our President. Was it worth it? More people would vote for you if you had any compassion at all.  God Bless you and it is up to him to forgive you.
Look, it is Christmas Eve.  and a time for forgiveness and happy thoughts. I really hope you can think of that, not sure it is possible, but I hope. Maria Mendoza-Sanchez is back in the United States after your admin kicked her out.  Read her story,  (1 of 2)

@realDonaldTrump HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHHHHAHAHAHAHHAH! Sorry I just had to laugh at that statement.  Go for it. Order the military to build the wall.   I would love to see their reaction, they would all finally see you for the terrible President, scratch that, Person you are. Individual #1
@DeplorableChoir You are ugly on the inside which makes you Uglier on the outside. I truly feel sorry for you. I hope you grow up and find real peace in getting along with all peoples.
@georgesoros I wish we had more influential people like yourself. Thanks again
@georgesoros  Just wanted to thank you for all you do, just read an article about how you are really a Nazi sympathizer, and wanted to let you know that no one really believe that. You must put up with a lot of BS like that. I am sorry that happens to you.  Thank You George.

@rupertmurdoch If we continue, we are going to have major civil disturbances and it will be the fault of the propaganda that comes from FOX.  Do you really want that on your conscious, or is it just about the money because it certainly is not the truth you are after.
@rupertmurdoch Sir, I am reaching out to you because I am very worried about the direction this country is going. I am asking for your help. Please try to become a real news station. I used to watch Fox all the time, now Can't stand it, because of the lies and hate you promote.
@FoxNews @seanhannity Oh and Carlson, don't forget to show him the door either
@FoxNews @seanhannity FOX-Please for the sake of our Country get rid of Hannity, Ingram, and change your programing to report the truth.  Stay conservative, but don't keep feeding lies to the citizens
@BarackObama Just read a story about the meeting you had with @BetoORourke I really hope you give him the encouragement and the support he should have for 2020.  He really is the real deal. My opinion and I do not live in Texas.
@senatemajldr  I know you are from Kentucky and all, but why does it always look like you have a corn cob stuck up your A$$. in every picture you take.
@DonaldJTrumpJr You should have thought of that before you decided to follow your Dads Guidance.  Now what they have to look forward to is their Father not being around much.  Honestly I feel bad for both your daughters and sons, because they did not ask for what is coming

@realDonaldTrump I really wish I had never heard your name. I pray everyday for something that would stop this nightmare, and that you did not exist as President.  Take your golden house and just go away
@realDonaldTrump it is not a witch hunt, it is not fake news.  no one is out to get you, they just want what is right, and you know deep inside, you know that what you do is not, NOT alright.
@realDonaldTrump the health of the United States rest solely with you, please quit, please go away. just frickin stop, stop everything and go away
@realDonaldTrump give it up my friend and go away

To everyone and all. I hope your Thanksgiving holiday was awesome. I hope everyone starts getting along with each other, and I really hope the next two years are more drama free.  I doubt it but I can hope
@realannapaulina From one Vet to another.  Please give up the Fox News Mentality.  You look like you could be a fun person to know, but the bad ideas will get in your way of happiness
@realDonaldTrump Are you kidding me? that is what you think about? Sad very Sad
@StrawberrieGina Seriously, I have looked at every picture I could find of you, and none of them show your nipples. I really want to know what they look like?
@StrawberrieGina Just one question.  Are you single?
@realDonaldTrump — 6,420 over 649 days,  That is the number of Lies you have told since being in office.  Makes me want to go right out and vote against you.
@HeatherLockleer Wow I just realized you are the same age as I am, very young and ready to have fun.  LOL
@HeatherLockleer I hope you are doing OK, Happy Thanksgiving to you. I have admired you for a very long time. Hope you are doing well.
@realDonaldTrump Scripted much?
@realDonaldTrump You go Trump, Make America suck Again. That is what you are leading us to. I have never disliked someone as much as I do you. I honestly cannot wrap my head around you being the President.
@selenagomez  Just wanted you to know I have followed you ever since the first days of Waverly place. I hope you are doing well. Hit me up if you ever want to chat with someone ordinary and not very exciting.

@sethmoulton primary business at hand: beating the Republicans sufficiently hard and sufficiently often until the Republican Party regains a semblance of sanity. (2 of 2)
@sethmoulton There is no need for any of this. Pelosi stays as speaker. Steny Hoyer goes, replaced by, say, Hakeem Jeffries of New York. Jim Clyburn does what he wants, and the new generation moves into position as deputy whips under him. Then the Democratic Party can get back to the (1 of 2)
@RepTimRyan Do not start the new congress with fighting among the same party.  Back Speaker Pelosi and get things done. DO not rock the boat now leave that for the republicans
@sethmoulton Don't mess up the new Congress by trying to put someone besides Pelosi as house leader. If the Democrats work together you guys may actually get something done, not if you start off this way though
@RepPerlmutter Don't act like a republican, this is a great opportunity for the Democrats.  Pelosi is the Speaker the Public wants
@realDonaldTrump You Sir are the Disaster! Please, do not harm this country any longer by even thinking of running in 2020. You can honestly say you have done "enough"
@realDonaldTrump Your approval rating is high 43% the MSM is at 57% Looks like they may be low but not as low as you.
@realDonaldTrump You sound like a scared little kid.
@realDonaldTrump Except you did not go because of the rain, Damn, I bet the veterans who have fought and died in the two world wars could have not gone because of the rain, snow, mud, starving conditions and much worse. SAD! 	Oh happy Veterans Day! wait that's right you are not a veteran.
@stevenmsalinas @AndrewGillum Go the "F" away stevie boy. you are absolutely wrong. Of course "count every vote" is very democratic. Why? I know you have to ask this because of your comment, why is because "Every Vote Counts!"
@AndrewGillum I love it Mr. Gillum! that was exactly, perfectly what I wanted to say, well except for the part about counting every vote, that should be automatic. The other part about Trump being an embarrassment right on the nose!
@realDonaldTrump I bet you got bullied a lot as a child, am I right?
@realDonaldTrump you are such a divisive twit
@realDonaldTrump I really Hate the way you divide this country. why don't you take your most loyal base and go somewhere you can be in charge of everything. Say North Korea since you love the guy so much.
Let the Russian investigation continue without interruption. This Country has gone through enough!  Let the TRUTH be told one way or the other. The American people have the right to know, and it would be a shame to deny that right.
@PressSec HAHAHA, sorry "manhandled the Intern"? she came after him
@RyanCostello Extremely well said. 	How do you think us independents view him. mach worse I assure you.

Beto O’Rourke, SIR! I want you to win this senate race so much, I have asked all my relatives and friends in Texas to vote for you. BUT, just in the off chance cruz has to keep his seat, PLEASE consider running for President in 2020
@realDonaldTrump UNBELIEVABLE, As a retired member of the military with 4-combat deployments behind me, I am disgusted that you would send our troops to the border for your political gain. Some of these soldiers you are sending have already spent too much time away on real missions.  SMH sadly!
@realDonaldTrump If you were my grandfather I would have you involuntarily committed. How do you feel with trying to BS the People. Why?
#texasdebateI am proud to support @BetoORourke  because he is a Hell of a lot better than #LyingTed . He will bring back civility and dignity to Texas and the US
@realDonaldTrump @auctnr1 Stop, just stop
@UTHornsRawk You are kidding right?
@thenicolebell @tedcruz He is paying for BOTs
#texasdebate If you took the BOTs out of tonight's tweets there would be zero support for Ted cruz.  Vote for @BetoORourke
@KevoWray @tedcruz BOT!!!!!
WHy does Cruz always think he has to attack? That is the problem with the whole country. We need to understand and work together more, and I think O'Rourke is the one who will do that	  #texasdebate
Ted cruz needs to go, Beto O'Rourke for Senate.  Enough of the lies from the Republicans	  #texasdebate
@DonaldJTrumpJr  you are a sad little boy
@SenSchumer  Stick it to the republicans do not make it easy for them. (2-2)
@SenSchumer Honorable Mr. Schumer, Please tell all the candidates who need campaign to leave and go do that, Force the republicans to do a cloture vote and a confirmation vote on each judge. Let the republicans be forced to stay and vote while the Dems are out campaigning. (1-2)
@FLOTUS  (2) It is not all about politics as much as about the kind of person you are married too. Good luck with that.
@FLOTUS (1) Mrs. Trump, not being able to work with aide agencies is a very sad thing. You have to understand that many people will stop giving money to an agency just because your husband through you are associated with it.
@senatemajldr You owe it to the American people to try your damndest to figure out how to bring usd together you twit.  You were elected not to cause more partisan ship  but to figure out a way to work together. Definitely, not to support the president, he is going to kill us al

@SenBobCorker As a fellow Republican        all I can say is Sad very  very Sad!
@tedcruz Go Away, hide under a rock or something, but leave the politics to grownups. You have embarrassed Texas long enough.
@DavidAFrench Sad!
@Sarah_Hyland I think I could really find you a very interesting person. hahaha Look at me trying to be all political, what I would rather say is I find you to be a very Beautiful lady.  never know what offends anymore	thanks
@Sarah_Hyland I looked over some of your tweets, I think you are a very funny and passionate person. Sorry I have never known you before tonight. I was looking for news on the Kavanaugh hearings  and you popped up.  If I were a younger man... I think I could really, 1 of 2
@Sarah_Hyland Thank you for sharing. I am sorry for what has happened to you as well as many many many other women. God bless, and I hope you can forgive the male race
@FLOTUS You seem like a very outstanding person.  I have listened to you talk and have come to the conclusion you are really not into all the stuff going on around you. Hopefully you will find a way out. best wishes ma'am.
@realDonaldTrump  better look out! one of your friends are in trouble, Kevin Jackson was fired today

@realDonaldTrump BTW. You know how you love going on about how you have done more than anyone else? I truly believe you have, more corruption, more debt, more division, more hate. You have served fantastically in these fields  better than ANYONE ever has.
@realDonaldTrump You are an IDIOT! Do you know nothing? All you see id yourself wherever you look. Your time's almost up if Mueller don't get you then voters will.  Then hopefully the country will start to right itself after the damage you and you alone have done.
@JusticeThomas  Do you think that Brett Kavanaugh is a good pick for the supreme court?  you made fun of Cory Booker's Spartacus comment which I also found to be over board. but I want to know, no bullshit, how you feel?

How the Hell Do I use Twitter to communicate with the United States? we have to Talk

@GovofCO well now ok, I do not agree with banning e-cigs!  it has given me the opportunity to quit cigarettes. for that I am very grateful. lets keep in mind it is the parents responsibility to stop their kids from smoking...Mine sure did...until I was in the military around 24yo
@hickforco You Know, I would consider voting for you as president, I really would. I am no longer a resident of Colorado but I do like what you have done there.  Put me on your mailing list
@YouDontKnowJake @realDonaldTrump That will work, but you need the chinese handcuffs for his thumbs to keep him from tweeting too.
@realDonaldTrump Too bad you did not live in Puerto Rico, then maybe we would not have to put up with you sniveling self-centered crap. I pray the Mr. Mueller puts you away for a very long time. I never thought I could dislike someone as much as I do, you. thanks for that.

@SenSanders This is crazy, what can be done about all of the lies coming out of Official twitter account?
@realDonaldTrump @SnoopDogg I can imagine what would happen, Obama would Laugh at the fun being had

@realDonaldTrump Srewup Big time, Mcmaster's needs to resign now if that is how you are going to give him free reign with staffing. BAD MOVE

@realDonaldTrump I served with him at Talafar, his solution was genius.
@realDonaldTrump Please don't screw up HR, he is one of the best Commanders I ever had. Listen to him don't try and control him.
@realDonaldTrump The real scandal here is we have a President who keeps saying these things...
@realDonaldTrump The FAKE News talk is below you. and it makes you seem petty
@realDonaldTrump  Please stop with all the FAKE News talk.  Give us the voters time to figure out. Both L and R have exaggerated stories
@realDonaldTrump Because you might want to remember that half of the population is liberal and they have needs and opinions too.
Does that Mean Bannon wrote the executive order that Trump signed? If that is the case I guess we do know who is in charge... https://t.co/mQMK1yXdLQ
@seemstween it, in fact, relates people who use marijuana to some kind of derogatory Comedy Movie. Just think about it please
@seemstween I really wish that journalist would stop using slang words like "Stoners" when they write their articles. It does not help.
