@Easy_To_Slip @CBSNews It's a slippery slope. Thanks for the discussion, have a great weekend.
@Easy_To_Slip @CBSNews (3) Point being, white workplace racism against people of black descent via At-Will abuse is a nationwide epidemic, &amp; I hope that this case (&amp; others like it) will help to shine a light on it, start discussions, &amp; hopefully, get laws passed that protect our place therein.
@Easy_To_Slip @CBSNews (2) If you did know, you wouldn't feel so shocked about what happened here (or for example, with how Micah X. Johnson responded). I feel that you think that black folks are just supposed to take it lying down. That's not going to happen....
@Easy_To_Slip @CBSNews (1) Chuck, read the 1st sentence: "but we don't know" what happened. Don't make this about me, stick to the facts of the instant case. It seems as if you don't have a grasp of how just visceral white racism has affected black people (IF that's what happened here)....
@Easy_To_Slip @CBSNews Sorry, that won't happen here, Chuck (I work in the legal field). But you'd be surprised at what some judges will allow as mitigating circumstances during a trial.
@Easy_To_Slip @CBSNews What makes you think their lives were more worthy than his, &amp; that they had the right to interfere with this man's mental state &amp; livelihood? That is white arrogance at it's finest, &amp; I'm sure that attitude is what precipitated these events.
@Easy_To_Slip @CBSNews (3) But we don't know, so what precipitated the events that transpired? Additionally, Chuck, white workplace racism acts in exactly the manner that you described, forcing blacks to HR where they don't receive help &amp; are then summarily terminated for raising the issue.
@Easy_To_Slip @CBSNews (2) If those killed were participants in his torment, I'm sure they realized they bit off more than they could chew &amp; were dealt with accordingly, thinking they'd get away with it. I'd say from his personal perspective, &amp; from a historico-racial perspective, justice was served...
@Easy_To_Slip @CBSNews (1) I disagree. Chuck, you don't know what it's like to be targeted, as a person of African descent, in the workplace, particularly given our history wherein whites have demonstrated an inherent evil towards blacks with many millions of lives lost. It builds up, &amp; it adds up....
@Easy_To_Slip @CBSNews I disagree. Black people have been targeted, ganged-up on, humiliated, &amp; fired, for NO REASON via At-Will abuse, since blacks have been rightfully permitted entry into the US workplace. We need to know what happened here. This man had a right to live, work, &amp; earn a living too.

@1wluckett @tking317 @tariqnasheed It doesn't matter sir. The INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY existed there, 100 years longer than it did here in the US, their descendants are now here, and Puerto Rico is the United States responsibility now. Do you follow?
@tking317 @1wluckett @tariqnasheed Spain was the first to do it! They were the charter generation of slave traders!
@FeministProteau @1wluckett @tariqnasheed I think you're in the wrong chat.
@1wluckett @tking317 @tariqnasheed "others must get down off our backs they have gotten enough which doesn‚Äôt belong to them"     My Puerto Rican Caribbean African ancestors would echo the same sentiment.
@tking317 @1wluckett @tariqnasheed I understand the argument, just think that the discussion needs to be broadened a bit.
@1wluckett @tking317 @tariqnasheed You still can't erase what the destruction of hundreds of years of slavery has caused to the American commonwealth of Puerto Rico &amp; to the descendants African slaves there, here, &amp; elsewhere. We are all owed!
@tking317 @1wluckett @tariqnasheed (2) Lastly, don't think it matters if slave traders came from Spain or Brittain or if the cash crop being pilfered was sugar cane or cotton. What matters is the experience of murder, subjugation, disenfranchisement, etc., via the psychological disorder of white supremacy.
@tking317 @1wluckett @tariqnasheed (1) That is correct. Puerto Rico is an American commonwealth &amp; so Caribbean DOTS should be included in the discussion, is my point. I do think there should be a hierarchy, with ADOS taking priority over DOTS, in all fairness.....
@1wluckett @tariqnasheed (2) ....Are their non-American African ancestors struggles different from your African-American ancestors' struggles, when the racist tyranny was the same, BUT, lasted LONGER than it did in the states? That's EXTRA justification to include DOTS in the reparations discussion!
@1wluckett @tariqnasheed (1) That's not logical. A mixed-race, American born DOTS (Descendant of Trans-Atlantic Slavery), whose faced white racism in his/her life, is facing the same adversity as ADOS, which is the psychological disorder of white supremacy....
@bobbysl8ter @tariqnasheed Sorry for the types, I see Twitter doesn't allow comment editing.
@bobbysl8ter @tariqnasheed What does 'In American' have to do with anything? Are you not aware that chattel slavery existed in the Caribbean for ONE HUNDRED years BEFORE ti did in the US, &amp; what if American born DOTS endured white racism like any other ADOS? It's the same struggle, shouldn't that count?
@1wluckett @tariqnasheed Does it matter if she doesn't identify as black if her Caribbean African ancestors suffered the same torturous indignities as their American counterparts, &amp; suffered it 100 years longer? She's American born, don't non-American DOTS (not nec. AOC) have a right to reparations?
