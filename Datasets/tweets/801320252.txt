This is no where more evident than his Tweets. Here's my prediction: Trump's tweeting is not an anomaly, it is the new normal. Media, Dems, and even Republicans mock his tweets, as they sometimes should. But Trump realizes that tweeting is the only way to bypass biased /7
But what is new about him is that we live in a digitized world, where everything is shared more often and recorded more often than that. His changes to Presidential conduct have torn down "the fourth wall" of politics. He's taken the palace intrigue and torn it off. /6

the President's policies are not (long term) impactful. So how is a President impactful? We're seeing two ways emerge: 1. Culture battles 2. Conduct of the President. In regards to first, both Obama and Trump have waged into the culture war battles, but inarguably, Trump has /4
Nothing really changes. And as everyone knows, the only way for an administration to have a lasting policy effect is through legislation (think ACA) which is much harder to pass than flippantly signing an executive order. This is known. Therefore, outside of legislation, /3

And the media will cover that. And then, when the media has been wooed by you, you have the legitimacy capital to lambaste the media for their obvious bias. That‚Äôs a combo that works. And the American people will go along with it.
I think @NikkiHaley has done a good job. You charm them using uplifting populist rhetoric about America (e.g. world is strong when America is strong, use clear moral voice when calling out dictators). Americans across the spectrum like this leadership.
Now where some Republicans err is in writing off all interaction in media. Big mistake. Yes, they‚Äôre terrible. But they own the name recognition game. And you need to play on their field to win. So how do you play their game while also calling out how they break the rules?
Me thinks Bob Menendez knows the answer. (Hint: they don‚Äôt and never will.)
Seriously, this stuff drives me up a wall. There is this reticence from Republicans to call out the very people in media who eviscerate their reputations off baseless accusations. Republicans are always bending the knee. Does Lib media bend the knee to Republicans? Hmm...
For Gods sake why is it so hard for Republicans to simply not forgive. Forgiveness is given when the other party admits mistakes. Has the media apologized for how awfully they treated Mitt? I think Brett Kavanaugh has an answer.
This is not to say I don‚Äôt like Mitt. I do! He is and has always been a decent man. But it was the Lib media who claimed he wasn‚Äôt! It‚Äôs infuriating to watch Republicans reconcile with their abusers while Lib media is more than happy to harbor and shelter their own indecent ppl.

@mikejgr I‚Äôd agree he‚Äôs temperamental and unpredictable. We shall see what the future holds.
@TheEzraSchwartz I mean this is just üë®‚Äçüç≥üëåüíã https://t.co/0lhAfp7FAC
@TheEzraSchwartz In earnest, however, the news media has made an absolute fool of themselves since (and before) Drumpf took office. They are hacks and the only people who seem to not notice they‚Äôre hacks are themselves. It‚Äôs an astonishing lack of self-reflection.
@TheEzraSchwartz HELL YEAH I AM. All news is fake news unless it‚Äôs good news about Trump.
@TheEzraSchwartz Yes but there is a difference between taking news reporting (moderately) seriously and intentionally commodifying th industry. Segments like these are prima facie examples that they don‚Äôt take themselves seriously.
@TheEzraSchwartz But actually, I‚Äôd argue every other channel. CNN parades as a news channel but they know they‚Äôre trying to entertain-ize news. It‚Äôs why they pumped Trump so hard.
@TheEzraSchwartz FOX NEWS. Oooooo!!!

@Saul_Lieberman @mikejgr But that wasn‚Äôt Bret‚Äôs column. Bret‚Äôs column was about the report card and future report cards.
@mikejgr aside, how about we acknowledge the past? Was moving the embassy good for Israel? Was Nikki Haley at UN good for Israel? Was pulling out of Iran a deal good for Israel? Yes they were. In his track record, Trump HAS been good for Israel. Do you think those things aren‚Äôt good?
@mikejgr In regards to 1) Agreed. But is US weak now enough to not support Israel? I think you and I would agree US is still strong. And with that strength will support Israel. 2) This notion is couched in the future tense, ‚Äúwon‚Äôt be true going forward‚Äù. Leaving the uncertainty of that /1
@Saul_Lieberman @mikejgr Agreed. And that‚Äôs what I just said.
@mikejgr I agree that withdrawing from the region is bad for Israel, but why neglect the tangible other accomplishments which secured Israel? Why not chew gum and walk at the same time: Trump has overall been excellent for Israel but this is bad for Israel.

@RabbiWolpe Welcome to political conservatism!
@WhatsnuGm @LahavHarkov So sad to here. Very sorry.
@michaelsafyan @LahavHarkov Judaism is a religion of hierarchical priorities. The Torah understands that resources are inexorably limited.Focus should be spent on areas with the most impact. 24 deaths over 1 year for 8.5 million people does not necessarily justify resources that could better spent elsewhere
@LahavHarkov Again, the deaths are horrendous and despicable. But can you explain why thousands are protesting what seems to be a nominal issue compared to other death-related crimes? Perhaps the injuries from domestic violence are unthinkably high? And that's why attention is being paid?
@LahavHarkov Are the 24 deaths a spike in domestic violence murders from the previous years? Any murder is inexplicable but 24 deaths across a country of 8.5 million over 365 days does not seem like a highly-urgent need. Is that why funding has not been budgeted for the government project?
@LahavHarkov @TheEconomist Yeah, they don't provide the metrics so its totally opaque. Myb a bit too in the weeds here but I think it comes from animosity many in Western media hold for Netanyahu. From The Times to The Economist, it often seems as though they hold Bibi in more contempt than, say, Erdogan.

records from her neighborhood. Her home already had two doors before she recorded the incident in 2012. 	It seems that her story is falling apart. For Kavanaugh's name, will Republicans follow this accusation through to truth?
When will Republicans go on offensive to investigate Ford's claims? To keep tally, her claim has now:	1. Been denied, under oath, but her best friend whom she testified was there.	2. Refused numerous attempts from Sen. Grassley to testify.	3. Been debunked based on real estate /1
The Right is united at this moment, shockingly. Just wait for Trump to ruin it.

Dems like to claim incivility is sole child of Republicans. But demonstrations like @SenFeinstein with Kavanaugh today squarely lays blame on the left side of the aisle. Trump is crass, yes. But he‚Äôs a symptom, not the source.
Enough of the collegiality between Reps and Dems in Congress. Actions like @SenFeinstein do not deserve friendships from folks across the aisle.
There is a terrible irony to the fact that @SenFeinstein believes sexual assault allegations are deligitmazing bc sexual assault is terrible, yet manipulated the timing of the allegations to spike Kavanaugh nomination at last second. Is sex assault bad or a useful tool? Pick one.
Frankly, my primary feelings right now are prayers for Kavanaugh and his family.  A family man, good citizen, and a lauded scholar has been incinerated once again through entering the fire pit of United States politics. Just heart wrenching.
Whether the allegations are true or not, the Democrats have now destroyed any semblance of deceny in the confirmations of three Republican nominees (Bork, Thomas, Kavanaugh).

As an aside, the fact that the National Security Advisor of the United States holds an open Q and A session with a potpourri of American citizens, with none of the questions manufactured, is an incredible testament to the transparency inherent in the US form of governance.
@AmbJohnBolton "You cannot have a strong US presence in the world without a strong domestic economy and you cannot have a strong domestic economy without  strong presence in the world."		Free trade fuels a strong US economy and in turn, fuels the US to maintain a global order.
Interesting note on the political developments of newly formed states by @AmbJohnBolton, "You don't bring political maturity to a new people by taking hard decisions away from them."
even as it continues to support those very states that disagree with it.	The US is an ultimate power that does not seek ultimate power.	It's a beautiful thing.
and uphold the jurisdiction of the ICC should they choose. 	Name me a global superpower in human history that has such a marked opinion on an issue related to other states yet willingly permits other states to hold opinions that stand in contradistinction to its own position, /2
US approach to foreign sovereign states is something to behold and admire. 	After taking 25 minutes to lambaste the unaccountable power the ICC holds and the consequential evil it pervades, @AmbJohnBolton still maintains that other foreign states have every right to invest in /1
@AmbJohnBolton "God bless the people of Great Britain who voted two years ago to get out of the European Union."
@AmbJohnBolton "On this earth, we don't recognize any authority higher than the US Constitution."
FWIW, the ICC is a global, unaccountable, and frankly unconsented-to international court that consistently harbors dictators and dictatorial regimes.	Yet again, another strong and correct disruption from the Trump team in international politics.
@AmbJohnBolton "We will let the ICC die on its own. After all, the ICC is dead to the US."	Straight fire from NSA.

That eminently being the case, why not unabashedly continue to support the Western, democratic, liberal, capitalistic State in the conflict? I see no good answer not to.	Something for @RichardHaass, DC, and others to consider.
Israel is markedly the same. Same antagonism, same blame-shifting, same terror threats. Nothing has changed. Except for stronger Israeli support, of course.	What to surmise? That heavy-handed support for Israel is, at the minimum, not an obstacle to peace. /3
This tweet underscores how uninformed DC circles are about the conflict. 	It's astonishing that despite all the pro-Israel moves from the administration---embassy move, UNRWA withdrawal, 200 million cut to PA, PLO office closed, etc.---that the Palestinian attitude towards /2
The Trump Presidency has upended norms. Some bad, some good.	The approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is an excellent example of a good disruption. 	The thinking in DC think tanks, though well intentioned, has long since been detached from the reality on the ground. /1 https://t.co/8J9YGHUijd

@SenateMajLdr‚Äôs laser focus on confirming federal judges as a bulwark against future leftist tyranny is excellent, no doubt. But serious question: if we approach a point where the executive branch seeks to quash individual liberties, can the courts actually stop it?
And unlike pundits, commentators, and spokesmen for conservatism who operate outside elected positions, @BenSasse was indeed elected to carry out conservative policy by his constituents. His lecturing now will not fulfill that agenda. It will hamper it.
And I think @ComfortablySmug is right. We‚Äôre two months out of the midterms. This is not the time to starting dumpling on the GOP. You don‚Äôt like it, fine. But you‚Äôre gonna hate the opppsite in @chuckschumer more.
This is a teeter-totter moment for @BenSasse. He‚Äôs going to have to decide if he will become a other GOP Resistance Hero or if he‚Äôll harness himself to @SenateMajLdr and their agenda. He looks to be teetering to become a resistance hero. That‚Äôs not good.

@BenSasse hit it on the head today with his opening statement. https://t.co/52zC7ZtLbv
regular life and thrusted gross and derisive language into the forefront of politics. 	That‚Äôs how we got here.
2016-now: There is so much power in the executive branch that the stakes are too high. People view their lives as actually impacted by whomever holds the office of the Presidency. That power combined with the vitriol employed by Democrats has created a vacuum of civic meaning /6
e.g. more people enrolled in Medicare, food stamps, social security, etc. 	1980-2016: Democratic politics eviscerated civility in politics by deriding any opposition candidate with racist, sexist, and xenophobic accusations. Power continued to accrue in the executive branch. /5
the executive branch. With all this power, whomever carried it was an important decision. 	1980-1992: Reagan successfully peeled back much of the executive power but he didn‚Äôt nullify it. He just halted its growth temporarily. As such, executive power continued to grow /4
1940s-1980: Further centralization of power into the executive branch with the presidencies of Truman, Kennedy, LBJ and more. The accumulation of power in the executive branch not only deprived Americans of agency in their own lives but further upped the ante for who controlled/3
1930s: FDR accumulates an unprecedented amount of power in the executive branch. His behavior as President set a precedent for others to follow, namely, the Presidency as ghost legislator in lieu of Congress. /2
Here‚Äôs the timeline of how I believe we came to this tense head in American life and politics: /1
It‚Äôs all acting. That‚Äôs all it is.            And we‚Äôre the audience. https://t.co/9rbn0Fd1z1
Pet peeve: when people elected or nominated to public office laud the diversity of their colleagues and peers.	Diversity doesn't matter. Merit does. I don't care if someone is black, Jewish, man or woman. Do they qualify for the job? Yes or no.

theirs. Stay in your lane.
Outside of that, I think it poor professional practice to call out and admonish other news sites. None of you are running a political campaign so why attack the other side? I've always found this a conundrum. Stay in your lane, do your job and let the others in your industry do
This is my prediction and we'll see if I'm right. END
and not through cable television. What does that mean for media influence? It means that it will no longer be as influential. It's a matter of time but the whole landscape of "mainstream media" will be nullified and we will replace it with "partisan fractured online media". /9
with every year and cable news, not now, not in 10 years, but in 20 years or more will be as relevant as a partisan online opinion site. Increasingly, younger people are consuming information and media through streamed services (Youtube, on-the-go news sites, etc.) /8
So how will this story end? Like all human endeavors, markets react and technology advances. 	Media companies are losing their hold on Americans. More and more news is fractures and consumed through partisan sites. It's just a fact. More Americans are cutting the cord /7
whether we praise or admonish, the media will see either method as an vindication of the work they're doing! There is no winning. There is just lose-lose ing. And thus this problem will never end. Until there is a Democrat in office, of course. /6
When it comes to human action, we have a binary approach: praise or admonish. Those are our basic to approaches. Typically, praise fosters more behaviour and admonishment minimizes bad behavior. But the great bind the American people face now is that no matter what, /5
that they are doing a good job. And rightfully so. Thus anytime a member of the media receives and award for "outstanding journalism" or "integrity in reporting" they once again reinforce their sanctimonious image of themselves. This is the second way we lose.
which will cause them to actually introspect. To them, every attack is actually seen as a reinforcement of the work they do. That's one way we always lose. 	The obvious opposite is when media is praised. Well obviously anybody who is praised takes that as an indication /3
that they are biased or that they explicitly pursue certain stories or narratives only further EMBOLDEN their sanctimonious attitude of themselves. 	"Some is attacking us?! It's because we're doing our jobs! They just don't like the truth!" There is no attack on the media /2
Here is what I call the "Lose-Lose Media" situation. 	One the one hand, media members look at any criticism of themselves as attacks from "people who deny facts and can't stand the truth." They see themselves are the arbiters and deliverers of truth. Accusations against them /1
Check the data! Trump got loads of unearned media in the primaries. And do you know from who? Not @FoxNews. These people created the animal they so loathe. And they live in such a cocoon that they don't even realize they are responsible. 	https://t.co/ffIpnZXrBn
Pictures below: the member of the media most responsible for Trump's rise. https://t.co/ut1orKzyx5
With that said, here is yet another prominent example. Chuck Todd, anchor for @MeetThePress posits that the people to blame for the assault on media? Not him, of course! No, it's the evil people at Fox News. When will these people introspect? Never.  https://t.co/TcbewCiPUe
@Jamie_Weinstein asks his guests on every one of his shows "What is the most undercovered story in the media?" There are a bevy of answers given. 	Here's mine: The absolute lack of introspection media has failed to conduct after 2016. They didn't introspect. They doubled down.
This outpouring of reasons for no confirm Kavanaugh from Dem Senators is bad not only because it's unsubstantiated but because judges DO NOT MAKE LAW. Judges cannot "threaten American lives". Judges rule on the cases as it regards the law. Judges do NOT make law. Congress does.
This Kavanaugh hearing should not have been streamed. It's not only showmanship from protesters, but worse it is showmanship from our politicians. We no longer elect officials. We now elect actors.
