@GeorgePaschall @cubancafecito @TurtleCrone @HuntedHorse In addition to the elimination of the individual mandate...I'm 29 yrs old with zero health issues and I pay $395/mo for health insurance thanks to Trump policies which, when evaluated by the CBO (run by GOP members/staff), predicted would go up 30+%. They were right.

@GeorgePaschall @cubancafecito @TurtleCrone @HuntedHorse What does that have to do with anything we're talking about here? The tax cut does not benefit any middle class Americans. There is a reason the GOP has completely stopped talking about it and no candidate wants to run a campaign touting it...

@Reblyn1963 @BreitbartNews @JimmyKimmelLive An accusation she made under oath...the. Later retracted after being paid "hush money" like Stormy Daniels...she said he tore the hair out of her scalp while he pinned her down and raped her in their own home with children in the other room
@Reblyn1963 @BreitbartNews @JimmyKimmelLive He was literally on the cover of people magazine "Best Sex I Ever Had" edition bragging about his affair with Marla Maples while still married to Ivan who later accused him of violent rape
@Reblyn1963 @BreitbartNews @JimmyKimmelLive That argument does not apply to a man accused by 21 women of sexual assault, accused of consenting affairs with 2 other women and has admitted to other completely separate affairs while married with children
@Reblyn1963 @BreitbartNews @JimmyKimmelLive Trump's infidelity and personal admission of sexual assault is in no way whatsoever comparable to a late night comedy show where participants sign release forms and are unpaid...
@jeannewall20 @BreitbartNews @PearsonHytop25 Fake news video with audio? Hmmm...not sure that argument works this time...
@Reblyn1963 @BreitbartNews @JimmyKimmelLive People are allowed to change. If you can't learn to forgive and forget, you will find yourself alone one day
@Reblyn1963 @BreitbartNews @JimmyKimmelLive When someone grows up eating meat then as an adult becomes vegan and explains why they made that choice, does that make them a hypocrite?

They just want realistic reform. Something has to change
@Mitozze @Firemonkuu @krix_olsen @DSiPaint @KyleKashuv @DLoesch Most ppl opposed to their agenda are seriously thinking that their at risk of gun confiscation or a 2a repeal...that will never and could never possibly happen.

@Mitozze @Firemonkuu @krix_olsen @DSiPaint @KyleKashuv @DLoesch Thats intentionally misleading bc he is "exposing the gunshow loophole" by approaching licensed gun dealers at the show who have to conduct background checks, not private sellers. And entering gun stores and pawn shops. They're all required to do background
@Mitozze @Firemonkuu @krix_olsen @DSiPaint @KyleKashuv @DLoesch If it weren't for the massive NRA lobbying efforts all politicians would support universal background checks since over 90% of Americans support them...how can u blame the FBI for following the laws of due process?
@Firemonkuu @Mitozze @krix_olsen @DSiPaint @KyleKashuv @DLoesch That's ridiculous. Democrats proposed a universal background check for all gunses 3 times since 2012 and McConnel never even allowed it to go to the floor for a vote...
@Firemonkuu @Mitozze @krix_olsen @DSiPaint @KyleKashuv @DLoesch In Parkland, yes. But the gun show loophole is real. Private sellers do not have to conduct background checks. Anybody can walk in and buy an AK and walk out and open fire in the parking lot and the seller is not at fault bc they were abiding by the law....
@Mitozze @Firemonkuu @krix_olsen @DSiPaint @KyleKashuv @DLoesch My fired bought a Kel tec sub 2000 from a different seller and same thing...never even asked for identification. They're exempt from background checks bc they sell less than 30 gun a month and are considered private sellers

@Firemonkuu @Mitozze @krix_olsen @DSiPaint @KyleKashuv @DLoesch No I don't. I think they should at minimum be regulated the same as handguns...But in MD we have an assault weapons ban and I can still buy HBAR rifles without any waiting period so it's a joke anyway.
@Mitozze @Firemonkuu @krix_olsen @DSiPaint @KyleKashuv @DLoesch I will send a link
@Mitozze @Firemonkuu @krix_olsen @DSiPaint @KyleKashuv @DLoesch To me, it doesn't matter. How about the terror watch list?
@Mitozze @Firemonkuu @krix_olsen @DSiPaint @KyleKashuv @DLoesch The FBI could be surveiling a known terrorist 24/7 waiting for them to attack but does not have legal authority to prevent them from purchasing a weapon unless they are a convicted felon
@Mitozze @Firemonkuu @krix_olsen @DSiPaint @KyleKashuv @DLoesch You are competing wrong on this. Unless you've been convicted there is nothing preventing you from buying a gun.
@Firemonkuu @Mitozze @krix_olsen @DSiPaint @KyleKashuv @DLoesch Yea and I live in MD and knew the assault weapons ban was impending so I made sure I got mine before it went into effect. Like I said, I have no problem with guns or ppl owning them, so long as they're willing to go thru a background check...
@Mitozze @Firemonkuu @krix_olsen @DSiPaint @KyleKashuv @DLoesch Yes. That's simple math. Big pharma is thousands of times larger than the gun industry...
@Mitozze @Firemonkuu @krix_olsen @DSiPaint @KyleKashuv @DLoesch This is a fact. There are ppl on terror watch lists who cannot board an airplane but they can purchase an AR and 10k rounds of ammo and body armor at a gun show from a private dealer without any type of background check
@Mitozze @Firemonkuu @krix_olsen @DSiPaint @KyleKashuv @DLoesch They go beyond a pro gun agenda. They oppose any and all forms of gun regulation. The 2A calls for "well-regulated." Why can known ISIS supporters living in the US, on terror watch list and no-fly list buy as many guns ammo as they want?
@Firemonkuu @Mitozze @krix_olsen @DSiPaint @KyleKashuv @DLoesch At least 5-6yrs ago at the Dulles Expo gun show
@Firemonkuu @Mitozze @krix_olsen @DSiPaint @KyleKashuv @DLoesch I knew of the organization and that it stood for gun owners rights. Now that I am aware of the full scope of their lobbying efforts and disproportionate influence over elected officials I no longer support them. I'm still a gun owner and support 2A
@Firemonkuu @Mitozze @krix_olsen @DSiPaint @KyleKashuv @DLoesch The only point I am trying to prove is that when a person attacks the NRA, it is not an attack on individual members. Many likely take it that way but they're wrong.
@Firemonkuu @Mitozze @krix_olsen @DSiPaint @KyleKashuv @DLoesch Didn't have to cancel. I just never renewed and that's my point exactly! They claim 5million members. How many joined bc they fully support their agenda and how many wanted a weekend pass to the gun show or some other incentive they were offering at the time?
@Firemonkuu @Mitozze @krix_olsen @DSiPaint @KyleKashuv @DLoesch See my tweet about membership incentives to enter gun shows. That's why I used to be a member...I didn't sign up bc I wanted to support the NRA's agenda, I didn't know anything about them at the time...
@Firemonkuu @Mitozze @krix_olsen @DSiPaint @KyleKashuv @DLoesch Which makes me wonder how inflated their member numbers are when they offered me a 1yr membership for $20 which included a weekend pass to the gun show. Likely hundreds of other ppl signed up that same day for the same reason. Not bc they support everything the NRA does
@Firemonkuu @Mitozze @krix_olsen @DSiPaint @KyleKashuv @DLoesch My only point is that attacking the NRA is not equivalent to attacking their individual members. I was once a member bc by signing up I got free admission to the Nations Gun Show in Dulles...I had no interest in joining but I did bc of the promotional offer.
@Firemonkuu @Mitozze @krix_olsen @DSiPaint @KyleKashuv @DLoesch There are endless examples...these are off the top of my head. If i had to compile a list, it wouldn't be difficult.
@Firemonkuu @Mitozze @krix_olsen @DSiPaint @KyleKashuv @DLoesch Did u read the original tweet I'm responding to? You're just tagged in it bc ur on the same thread but I'm replying to somebody else's question
@Firemonkuu @Mitozze @krix_olsen @DSiPaint @KyleKashuv @DLoesch Union members....
@Mitozze @krix_olsen @Firemonkuu @DSiPaint @KyleKashuv @DLoesch When somebody accuses a labor union of being currupt, are they also accusing every single union member (teachers, electricians, construction workers, etc.) of also being currupt just bc they pay union dues?
@Firemonkuu @Mitozze @krix_olsen @DSiPaint @KyleKashuv @DLoesch @jack @Twitter Cool. Me too.
@Firemonkuu @Mitozze @krix_olsen @DSiPaint @KyleKashuv @DLoesch Regardless, not a false equivalence since the exact same logic applies. Accusing an organization/business of something automatically implies you're attacking all members of said business/org at the same time. That's the argument this person is trying to make.
@Firemonkuu @Mitozze @krix_olsen @DSiPaint @KyleKashuv @DLoesch Ok. Then take my Netflix example instead...

@Mitozze @krix_olsen @Firemonkuu @DSiPaint @KyleKashuv @DLoesch So when anybody attacks Facebook for selling user data, by your logic, they're also accusing their 1.86 Billion FB users of doing the same.

@kylehyman @moormandd @LoveEachother14 @KyleKashuv Hahahahaha you deleted all your tweets!!!!
@moormandd You should go back and see whose comment you've been posting under all day...you've replied to my original post that Kyle was commenting on about 7 times and tell me I'm jumping into your conversation...

@kylehyman @moormandd @LoveEachother14 @KyleKashuv Nobody wants to be associated with him because he is toxic. He has nothing genuine to contribute. He simply regurgitates NRA and Fox News talking points, then proceeds to insult the father of a victim...
@kylehyman @moormandd @LoveEachother14 @KyleKashuv He's not an activist. He's an actor auditioning for a spot on Fox News. His only agenda is to attack those who are trying to inspire meaningful change. Just look at his insult-laden Twitter feed. He's obsessed with Hogg...there is a lot of underlying jealousy and malice, but why?
@Firemonkuu @krix_olsen @DSiPaint @KyleKashuv You're clearly oversensitive if they offend you. I'm a gun owner and I'm not intimidated by the other survivors, I'm inspired by them. The 2A intentionally included the words "well-regulated." So doesn't that make u anti-2A if ur against any and all regulations?
@kylehyman @KyleKashuv Really? So the other MSD student activists had nothing to do with Florida passing new gun legislation for the first time in over 20 years?
@LWilliamsio @KyleKashuv Apparently the victim's families do not agree with you.

@ScottPresler @tomiahonen @Truth_Again Chrysler CEO says the decision came in 2015. Almost 2 full years before Trump took office. https://t.co/RWpbb93t2Z
@ScottPresler @tomiahonen @Truth_Again Chrysler announced the move several years ago. It has nothing to do with Trump.
@JackPosobiec I bet that's why I saw all those airplanes at the airport today too!!!

@Sarah_G_Barker @JackPosobiec No, fortunately handguns are more heavily regulated in MD. Must be 21, take a short class to get a permit, and submit fingerprints and a passport photo. Also a minimum 7 day waiting period before you can take it home. You can also only buy 2 handguns max every 60 days.
@Sarah_G_Barker @JackPosobiec Here is an example of a "Maryland Law Compliant" AR modified with a HBAR barrel for sale right down the street from me in MD...no waiting period required to purchase. Any 18yr old can go buy this today for $600 https://t.co/9bN7R2PePB
@JackPosobiec Clearly you have no idea what you're talking about. Maryland sells the exact same rifles, replaced with HBAR barrels, to skirt the ban. You can walk into any MD gun store and walk out with an AR in 20min (I've done it). Only difference is the weight of the barrel. That's a fact.

@Cernovich If you don't believe me just Google: "Trump properties Chinese steel." Trump Org. official documents show he has been using Chinese steel for decades. Plus all his hotel furnishings are made in China or Bangladesh.
@Cernovich Thanks for the head up Mike! For all we know you could be saving lives with this post!
@Cernovich If that's the case, should we be anticipating the imminent collapse of nearly all Trump properties since they're also built with cheap Chinese steel? I'd be careful before booking a room at a Trump Hotel after this startling revelation! #trumptower #trumporganization
