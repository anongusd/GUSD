Due to Hillary no faith in election outcome, too many people voting that shouldn't be, dead people voting, illegals voting. Dems. No one believes in the Justice Department anymore. Full of hypocrisy and lies just like all that Hillary Clinton has contaminated.
The two party system of governance in US no longer exists. Due to Hillary's resistance movement no legislation done for two years. Due to Hillary's coup t'etat DOJ &amp; FBI gone to pot. Due to Hillary's agenda to impeach a sitting president, House Oversight doing heavy lifting.
The tremendous disservice the media is doing only delivering fake news, biased political news. Used to be our free press did America a favor, looking into leads, investigating things that looked suspicious, delivering a sourced cover story. Now they are worthless.
It is long past time to investigate Hillary Clinton.
There is a halt to presidential investigations by the House Oversight Committee led by Cummings. There is certainty this committee interfered with President Trump's negotiations w/North Korea. Shut down Committee for being so stupid as to interfere with international negotiations

There are 4 main pathways of legal migration: the family-based channel, the employment-based channel, the humanitarian channel &amp; the diversity lottery.  Dems want border entry for anyone anytime. Who cares who is entering the US? Americans do! President Trump &amp; Republicans do!

Islam is a political ideology cloaked in the name of religion.  It is    concession, oppression, suppression, bondage, and I believe, will be   the  one world religion spoken of in Bible prophecy, false prophet and   all. In May 2012 Islam is well on the way to taking over Europe
economies of  Egypt and other Mid East nations will likely fall apart   under impending  rigid Islamic rule with the new regimes. Lipkin   outlines Obama‚Äôs three  prong plan in the Middle East:
Some people believe that after the 2012 election if obama is re-elected,  he will open the gates and bring 100 million Muslims to the US in which  case, we Christians and Jews (kaffir) will be outnumbered and sharia  law will become the law of the land. This is real palpable fear
You don't have to believe it, I said some people believe it.   Go ahead  and guffaw if you must.  The number seems astronomical.  But I have learned that under the right  conditions, when you have evil people in charge who want to destroy this  nation, anything is possible.
Avi Lipkin has a source with a senior United Nations official that  the  U.S. will be a Muslim country by the end of Obama‚Äôs second term. It  is  now easy to see how that can happen, and quickly, since the  economies of  Egypt and other Mid East nations will likely fall apart
Avi Lipkin, who has been reporting on Islamic population and terrorist  concentrations in Latin America and Canada now for about twenty years,  wrote about it extensively in his first book, ‚ÄúIs Fanatic Islam a Global  Threat?‚Äù (published in 1998).
The religious nature of  Islam increases the fanaticism of its  adherents and thus the danger to  the Saints of God.  Where religious  Islam dominates Christians undergo  persecution and death.
In the Book of Revelation we read of the Beast and his False Prophet.    In Islam we see manifested both the beast and the false prophet since  Islam combines the religious with the secular much as Roman Catholicism  and the Holy Roman Empire during the Dark Ages.
plenty of information about the Islamic goal of a world caliphate out  there if people want to really find out the truth instead of burying  their heads in the sand and using the racism card.  Islam is not a race.   It is a political ideology cloaked in the name of religion.
The Europe you know is changing. You have probably seen  the landmarks.  The Eiffel Tower and Trafalgar Square and Rome's ancient  buildings and  maybe the canals of Amsterdam. They are still there. And  they still look  very much the same as they did a hundred years ago.
Democracy would end the day after Sharia was implemented."	 	 The  danger I see looming is the scenario of America as the last man   standing. The United States as the last bastion of Western  civilization,  facing an Islamic Europe.
All throughout Europe a new reality is rising: entire  Moslem  neighborhoods where very few indigenous people reside or are  even seen.  And if they are, they might regret it. This goes for the  police as well.
with baby strollers and a group of children. Their  husbands,  or  slaveholders if you prefer, walk three steps ahead. With  mosques on  many  street corners. The shops have signs you and I cannot  read. You will be  hard-pressed to find any economic activity.
It's the world of head scarves, where women walk around in  figure less  tents, with baby strollers and a group of children. Their  husbands, or  slaveholders if you prefer, walk three steps ahead. With  mosques on many  street corners. The shops have signs you and I cannot  read
We might be in the final stages of the Islamization  of Europe. This not only is a clear and present danger to the future of  Europe itself, it is a threat to America and the sheer survival of the  West.Wilders told CBN News. "It's the worst thing that could   happen.
Wilders never walks the streets without a security detail and he and his  wife must live in safe houses across the Netherlands. It's the price he  pays for speaking out against the Islamization of Europe.   "I  don't want to live - and my children will not live where Sharia Law
WASHINGTON -- Dutch politician Geert Wilders has been labeled "Islam's  public enemy number one." Consequently, he lives every day under a death  sentence from Islamic jihadist groups like al Qaeda. Now we  are seeing a caliphate forming right before our eyes and are too  PC!!
Every country where Islam has a presence has either been conquered by  force or by immigration and out populating the indigenous peoples,  finally forcing them into "submission" when sufficient numbers of  Muslims had increased to become the majority.  Study history.
Islam is a threat to our Western civilizations, to Christianity, to  freedom and democracy and there is creeping jihad just as there are  homicide bombers in the name of jihad.  Islam has not changed since the  days of the first muslim terrorist, mohammed,
What many of them do is marry a gullible woman so they can stay in the  country.  It is a mystery to me why any woman would want to become the  slave of a Muslim!	 	 Then of course if their girls have any connection to a non-Muslim they are murdered, "an honor killing".
Muslim immigration question: Approach this way: Instead of banning all Muslims, propose banning any immigrant from a list we built of countries that have an  element of terrorism within their borders.That would have a better  chance of passage.requires a Constitutional amendment,
Because of Islamic faith that pledges to bring down all gov around the world no person of that faith should ever be allowed to hold any  political office whether local, state or federal and that includes being  a judge, police officer or being in the military.

IMMIGRATION &amp; CITIZENSHIP IN US: Islam is the third largest religion in the United States after Christianity and  Judaism. According .... One of the earliest accounts of Islam's possible presence  in North America dates to 1528. Muslim sm-scale migration to the U.S. began 1840.

So, enough socialists in NY 14th cong dist to elect Ocasio-Cortez who is dangerous w/her Green New Deal, if passed would literally destroy America. Ocasio activated resentment for the amazon deal, contract w/NY 25,000 new jobs &amp; $30 billion in lost revenue was lost for the state.
So, there were enough Muslims who voted for this daughter of Palestinian immigrants, oldest of 14 children, Michigan Rashido-Tlaib. In 2008 she became first woman ever elected to Michigan state legislature. &amp; only the second woman elected to state leg in U.S.
So, there are enough Muslims in Minnesota that a Muslim could get elected, or Keith Ellison who held the 5th congr district seat from (1st Muslim to serve in Congress in 2006) 2007-2019 DFL Democratic-Farm-Labour Party; Keith Ellison, Louis Farrakhan, Ocasio-Cortez R anti-semitic
In New York, DEM Ocasio-Cortez, an avowed socialist. Wants United States to be socialist, like Bernie Sanders. She will be 34 and could run for president in 2024 as she will be 34 by inauguration day, January 20, 2024. She is good friends w/DEM Senator-MA; Ed Markey.
In Michigan, DEM RASHIDO-TLAIB, Muslim, supports Palestine even as the United States acknowledges Israel as a firm ally, &amp; supports Israel. Israel &amp; Palestine are still fighting. Palestinians kill &amp; fight Israelis and a border wall erected betw the 2 nations. US &amp; Israel friends
So, In Minnesota, DEM ILHAN OMAR, Muslim easily slid into Keith Ellison's spot in the House of Representatives even as he was being charged w/rape w/pictorial evidence even, he still was able to become Attorney General of Minnesota. US is antagonistic to Muslims because of 09/11.
The scenarios, events, that are real, killings, props that contribute to Hillary scenario capitulating herself from victim status to winner status:  "Doing the Hillary" game would have night club &amp; church mass shootings,anti-semitism events, red Maga hat hoax, etc.
Right now, though you are in complete misery, you kind of look like "Beto in the dentist office? There is nothing mechanical in your mouth like Beto." get well soon. https://t.co/8NX8uA4nNm
When you have bec "HILIFIED" you lose your reputation, newspaper, your jobs in Justice Dept &amp; elsewhere, you pay the price of losing at the game of "Doing the Hillary" and you become a Smullett  &amp; live the rest of your life in jail w/Hillary, the person who cost you your life.
When you are living life as if it were a video game, a game written and published by HC, you are the winner when you figure out what events, instances, framings, hoaxes, will be perpetrated internally and domestically by the hated demonic HC who wants you complicit in her crimes
So when the federal government agencies, DOJ, FBI, &amp; 17 intelligence agencies, are commanded by the Obama White House to be a part HC's grab for the presidency, They become complicit as well, even more so than the news media, because they did "the Hillary w/HC" &amp; go to prison too
When you do "a Smollett" you fail to convince people it was a hate crime, and in fact get prosecuted for the crime you tried to frame someone else for. Smolletts go  to prison bec they failed. "Doing a Hillary" means you get caught finally &amp; all the name of the puzzle is HC.
Instead of being a neutral vessel through which truth is communicated to America and indeed internationally! In fact, fake news is now the vessel, the accomplice of HC, complicit in the entire HC story as they consciously chose to be accomplices to HC, disseminated pub HC narrati
The media complicit in corroborating "all things Hillary, all things Democrats, all things liberal" as opposed to being neutral purveyors of news, instead R "partners in crime w/Hillary" Complicit in framing of Trump. Fake media is the accomplice that shares prison cell w/HC.
In this scenario victim (defeated HC) creates a world of "prefabricated events (mass shootings),  situations, to lend credibility to the perpetrator instead of credibility to the victim. Thus, "doing the Hillary" involv numerous crimes to portray winner as the reason it was done!
"Doing the Hillary" the emphasis is on the victim trying frame the winner to be a loser, while simult portraying HC the winner!
"Doing the Hillary" you frame someone for doing what you did. HC did it to make Trump look bad and make herself the winner (publishing books) Problem: FEDERAL CRIME. . Doing "the Hillary":  all about framing someone for what you did complete w/"made up events to support that."
That is what I think. He did a "hillary" https://t.co/VdCCpqPsnQ
When life events created like a video game: Perp is the aggressor &amp; tries to create a game(frame) that shows the victim is the actual reason perpetrator CREATED THE CRIME, &amp; therefore perpetrator is innocent &amp; victim is the perpetrator. Framing: The innocent perpetrated crime.

Thurgood Marshall served as chief counsel in the landmark 14th Amendment decision Brown vs. Board of Education (1954)	  Equal Protection Clause after decades of federal courts attempting to enforce Brown's mandate against repeated attempts at circumvention.[
[138] In Brown the Court ruled that even if segregated black and  white schools were of equal quality in facilities and teachers,  segregation was inherently harmful to black students and so was  unconstitutional. Brown met with a campaign of resistance from white  Southerners,
The Court held to the "separate but equal" doctrine for more than fifty years, despite numerous cases in which the Court itself had found that the segregated facilities provided by the states were almost never equal, until Brown v. Board of Education (1954) reached the Court
14th Amendment to the Constitution: forbids anything less than equal protection of the laws &amp; applies to corporations; forbids a State to deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws, applies to these corporations.

For budget reason alone the wall is a great thing if it keeps illegals from crossing the border and getting free everything while the rest of us work to pay for it!. Over $100 billion/MONTH paid to support illegals living in US. Obama brought a lot of them in. They are in US now. https://t.co/pmTtJQ13Xa

So Democrat Jussie Smollett trying to frame someone illustrates Goebbels effect when you accuse someone else of what you yourself are doing. i.e. when Dems try to make Republicans the bad guys. Anyway, Smollett exposes himself framer of crime for which he tried to frame someone
Chris Wallace on FoxNews Sunday is over. Excuse me while I go barf.
Chris Wallace is bullying and hammering his guest, Stephen Miller. Chris Wallace cannot be defended for his audacity. Chris Wallace is definitely pushing the Democrat's agenda for them. I thought FoxNews was supposed to be accommodating to both sides of opinion. Not bigot Wallace
Chris on FoxNews Sunday is ARGUING with his guest, Strumming on him like he was a Congressional Democrat. Shame on Chris Wallace. Could definately like Raymond Arroyo in his spot. Can't stand deep state Chris Wallace. Today, he is revolutionary as bullying is crass &amp; impolite!
Obama always divided everyone, people, pitted against each other, genders, classes, groups, racists, colleges, speakers, you name it, really anyone, anything. That was his prowess. DNC marketed, sponsored Obama for president &amp; did not tell America he was born in Kenya.
Now he is the enemy of  the people, having allowed the framing of a sitting president to be a traitor, colluding  w/Russia. But of course this was hogwash HC &amp; O cooked up. O adm weaponized government agencies against Trump. Obama always divided everyone, people,
O was born in Kenya. He violated from Day 1 that American president must be born in America. The DNC did this to America. DNC is the tentacle of government that presented him to America as an "OK candidate." Hold DNC responsible for the past  10 years of American demolition.
What a nasty precedent for Obama to make - President and broke laws, militarized, pitted everyone against each other not only in America but abroad too. Obama marketed America has a guilty country who must stand down now since America was bad in the past. O was an illegal pres.
Obama adm let all the cattle out of the pasture. Broke all laws that he possibly could do; violated The Constitution. What else would you expect considering he lied from Day 1. What a nasty precedent for Obama to make - he was president &amp; cramped business growth w/stifling laws.
In Russia, everything owned by the government The news is from the government and it is not what we call actual news, it is the news the government wants the people to have. Same w/corporations, owned by the government. Apple, public company -no coop w/gov or Trump supporter. https://t.co/0tjaPFVEnS
Is the MEDIA the reason of such division within our country? I think  so. MEDIA is the vessel through which flows, "Dems are right, Reps/Trump  are bad, place for leaks, where GPS landed  for MEDIA to distribute GPS  as truth. MEDIA is the dividing rhetoric between Dems &amp; Reps.
Political parties divided by the MEDIA outlets they watch. Trump supporters find ""fair &amp; balanced news" FoxNews (owned by 21st Cent Fox/Rupert Murdoch) Democrats find their news most reliable from CNN, MSNBC, CNBC. So Comcast owns NBC Univ which owns NBC, MSNBC, CNBC, Telemundo.
What we have seen &amp; heard coming out of the MEDIA (includes print copy like NY Times, includes cable news like CNN, MSNBC. All cable news the result of 6 international sources which is dished out for news media to broadcast, put in newspapers. Who are the 6 major sources?
The MEDIA has destroyed faith in American culture, respect for historical ancestors, invented EXTREME bias toward President Trump, ridicules, mocks, aggressively leads public opinion in only one direction: division of America &amp; impeachment of Trump.
The MEDIA divides political parties, congress, distributes bias, decides fate of public opinion of Trump, consistently hammers message again &amp; again. The MEDIA runs stories w/no source, no authenticity. The MEDIA is playing Americans against each other. MEDIA is not accountable!I

It is simple. Don't try to convince the girl you are something you are not. She will KNOW, if not now, soon. It is truthful things, cherishing, providing, security. Just be a nice clean shaven guy w/a job. that is attractive. PS These are attributes of a Republican. Dems R tricky
But if you are naturally bald or growing bald that is OK, it is just the intense fascination guys w/themselves, the turnoff; Births in US lowest since 1924. so guys, forget yourselves, stop thinking about "being cool" think wholesome: think about the girl not yourselves.
you all think you are really sophisticated and smooth for deciding  to shave your head like a woman shaves her legs, but guess what women  like hair on your head. PS girls, women like hair on the head, nice  clean shaven guys.
one more thing..the bald heads, yuk, I'm sorry guys, know you all think you are pretty cool, cool to guys maybe but not to women. Oh! what no polling on this subject, also about the facial hair, this isn't the 1850's, shave your face not your head. OK, got it?

One view of how men became leftists pansies on soy milk &amp; lean cuisine, GMo pills. Problem when only men think you are "cool." So due to Hillary, "feminist movement" girls/women are enemies of men. Steer clear of "feminist" women they are only interested in themselves."

It falls on the shoulders of Republicans to reverse it ‚Äî and to rescue  the rule of law for the American people of today and tomorrow,‚Äù Sessions  said.
In 2014 Sessions estimated, the nation‚Äôs population of  illegal immigrants at 12 million people. Sessions claims  that less than 0.1  percent of illegal immigrants were deported in 2013. (Obama in office 2009-2017)
In 2014 enforcement officials deported only 10,000 people who were  not caught crossing the border, did not have serious criminal offenses  or who were not fugitives or serial violators of immigration law,  according to Sessions.
Illegal workers taken into custody are quickly released bec there was no outstanding warrants or criminal convictions.  As a result, American workers and taxpayers slammed w/lower wages, higher unemployment. Congr Dems empowered this state of lawlessness, Sessions said.
The evidence shows Obama Adm NULLIFIED federal law. Under illusion of setting "priorities, they let anyone in the world into US to be free to illegally live, work,claim benefits as long as they were not caught committing a felony or other serious crime,‚Äù Sessions said.
Citing  a review of published Immigration and Customs Enforcement statistics  for 2013, Sessions estimates that 99.9 percent of illegal immigrants and  people who overstayed their visas were allowed to stay in the country  as long as they didn‚Äôt have criminal records. https://t.co/UZkLelcgkN
98 percent of all removals by Obama Adm immigration and customs officials considered "enforcement priorities" - consistently high deportations, record high, of people convicted of crimes, criminal offenses, illegal border crossing,fugitives from deportation.

Illegals don't want a border wall. It is all in the framing of a question on these polls to get an answer that they can portray as "against border wall." Really, haven't we all learned our lesson NOT TO TRUST POLLS SINCE ELECTION 2016. Just use your commonsense &amp; you will know.
PS Every American wants a border wall to be safe and keep out illegals that take jobs, proffer drugs, etc., plus Americans have to pay so much for their free healthcare, medicine, education, maintenance, food, etc., &amp; our country is trying to pay down our debt. https://t.co/fFdsv1kYbe
Don't forget to bring handcuffs, ankle bracelets for sensationalism. 	PS There are not that many socialists in America so how did all those new House candidates get elected? Do the voters know they are socialists? Did Ilhan &amp; Tashib &amp; Cortez tell them they are socialists,commies?

The Democrats have been attacking Trump ever since he through his hat in the ring for President. He has been pinpricked &amp; prodded since he &amp; Melania rode down the elevator. What on earth do you want from the man? He is fixing America. Democrats are trying to destroy America.
Have heard from the justice department well we'll just have to wait for him to do the right thing. 	Right.	Hasn't done it so far. Keeps coming up with something.	Stop the stupidity.	Americans tired of political haywire, we want to see people in prison for what they did to Trump!
Tear down the Mueller Investigation.	This is a wall between justice and injustice. 	With Mueller on the side of injustice, 	there is no difference between McCabe and Mueller. 	Stand for justice, not for hypocrisy. 	Tear down Mueller investigation. 	It  is illegal anyway. 	Stop it
So in essence what happened at border wall summit, Democrats got what they wanted and Republicans let them get what they wanted. I think we have faux Republicans. In other words, they were really a ploy. They were really Democrat but ran on Republican ticket.
In effect the bill and a national emergency could be incongruous. one can survive but both cannot be performed at the same time. Be caution that the border wall does not prevent Trump from building a border wall w/national emergency. If you sign both, could get zero border wall.
But what if by signing the border wall, President Trump is unable to do the border wall at all, 	because of the stipulations in the border wall he signed, he has stipulations on what he can and cannot do. Don't sign the border wall bill. Do the national emergency to be safe.

Let's have renewed interest in funding Social Security for workers on retirement. Fears of Americans in work force incl "no retirement safety net" Let's PROHIBIT Congress assessing these funds for their own interests this time. President Trump might consider because Lots of JOBS.

FIRE MUELLER. This is illegal. The Constitution gives us natural rights - the right NOT TO BE FORCED TO INCRIMINATE OURSELVES, Mueller does this all the time. By the 2nd Amendment we have the natural right to self-protection. the right to privacy. Trump's civil rights violated!
Also, The Constitution gives us right to provide protection against federal overreach and short cuts that violate American's right to be left alone (MUELLER HAS BEEN HARASSING AND DOGGING PRESIDENT TRUMP, trying desperately to froce Trump and his friends to incriminate themselves
The Constitution gives us natural rights: free speech, defend ourselves w/firearms, right to privacy, trial by jury, right not to be forced to incriminate ourselves, (like MUELLER IS DOING TO MANAFORT &amp; STONE)there R limits to fed power to solve crime &amp; terrorism. FIRE MUELLER!
Omar says she'll vote to impeach President Donald Trump if given the  chance. She was dogged during the campaign by allegations first raised  by conservative media two years ago that she married her brother and  committed immigration fraud. She denounced as "disgusting  lies."
composition of MN 5th Cong District: 100% urban	67.39% White16.64% Black6.05% Asian8.81% Hispanic1.23% Native American	Votes Dem +26. Keith Ellison held the position 2007-2019. June 5, Keith Ellison vacated his seat to be AG of MN. Democrat Ilhan Omar won seat.
Maybe the Democrats feel President Trump will send the military away or something. Only thing that is obvious is they want our country flooded with illegal immigrants. They love to put Trump under so much stress, though I have heard this socialist movement of immigrants worldwide
Or by accepting THE Summit agreement, President Trump appears compromising of his own high standards and purpose to protect America. President Trump should not be tempted with false dance step by Democrats, following their lead on anything can't be good.
It doesn't feel like President Trump is winning on border wall if he accepts a measly 1 billion or something when he asked for much more. Hearing the intended $ in the bill will only pay for 54 miles sounds pretty paltry also. He gains nothing by signing something unacceptable.

Maybe it will be the time of our lives, maybe not. But we will be ready and enthusiastic. Pelosi didn't get to take her little children to get jihabed, could have been a real mixer w/all the debris,like SF, LA, Dems are so apocalyptic have to watch them. Pelosi deceives always

Then take a jet and pay Ms queen of Alcatraz Hillarearunnin. ground her drone and give her that diamond ankle bracelet she has been dreaming about. Take along a young chick like AOC to pass the time w/Bill. Lasso that gal w/a caress and let's go to Washington for pipe cleaning.
There is this: No one wants to live in this America with unequal justice. Americans voted in the best president ever. He has been lame ducked all the way, still punished daily for leading this country. S T O P  I T! Start out w/something good for Mueller, then quickly Do-Si-do.
Build the dam think in one day and call it over. Dems could take a century to decide if they want to protect you and me. We don't want to wait until that day comes because we can't We have a nation to protect from illegals and from socio neonazists infiltration into our gov.

Serendipity-the occurrence &amp; development of events by CHANCE resulting in happiness or benevolence. 	Zemblanity-the occurrence &amp; development of events by CHANCE FOR AN UNHAPPY, unlucky prognostication
You can infer it is serendipity when things are going right, the god's are smiling. You can infer it is zemblanity when the puzzle pieces definitely are not fitting together, when nothing  works.
Always trying to shape public opinion in a negative way is what fake news does 24/7. In other words the person is paid to deliver ZEMBLANITY news (due to fate of gods, everything going to harr). SERENDIPITY as events positively enmesh, schmooze together as if in net.
e.g. A CNN news commentator should be trustworthy &amp; NOT be a propagandist.  The commentator shud drop-ship info to the public minus his/her own perception &amp; should not try to transfer his own bias to you. A PROPAGANDIST intentionally delivers NEWS=HIS OWN BIAS simultaneously.
If you are on a public platform as a news commentator, your job is to drop-ship properly sourced and/or researched news. In contrast, if you are a magician in the circus you intentionally deceive to create false impressions so the person is confused what is true or not true.

Congress also has the votes to send to President Trump a reconciliation  bill that defunds Planned Parenthood of +400 million in  taxpayer funding and instead funds community health centers,‚Äù she wrote.
It is not the "right of the woman" to kill her child.Vice President Mike Pence cast the tie-breaking 51st vote on a bill that  would let states block more than $200 million in Title X funding from  going to Planned Parenthood or any organization that provides abortions. https://t.co/3ThqyQUfDA
Planned Parenthood has consistently maintained that federal money received by Planned Parenthood is not used to fund abortion services, but pro-life activists have argued that the federal funding frees up other resources that are, in turn, used to provide abortions.
Planned  Parenthood's ABORTION business is a billion dollar business that makes  most of its blood money by killing children--with a focus on black and  minority children.  Abortion is the #1 killer of Black Americans.
.As of today, abortion has successfully killed more than 17 million black babies since 1973. Abortion providers located mostly in black neighborhoods, still delivering same message, "that if you are black, poor, living in urban areas, they are not worthy of life."

PPFA has its roots in Brooklyn, New York, where Margaret Sanger opened the first birth control clinic in the U.S. in 1916. Sanger founded the American Birth Control League in 1921, which changed its name to Planned Parenthood in 1942.
Shut down Planned Parenthood, an international corporation whose mission is to abort babies. By the very existence of PP, the US is in violation of universal "right to life, to live in freedom &amp; safety." Democrat Gov of NY passes a law to abort full-term baby because PP exists.

correct about one thing, there is no such thing as "radical" Islam - it  is simply islam, the death cult of Muhammad and his Muslim thugs that  would slit your throat as quickly as they would anyone else's.
Obama's presidency was clear: he had a pronounced affinity for Muslims &amp; Islam, praising Islam repeatedly, supporting  the Muslim  Brotherhood, favoring Muslim refugees over Christians,  concluding the  Iranian nuclear deal, pressuring and insulting Israel  repeatedly, and  more.
Obama ‚Äúwas a Muslim in his youth who never renounced Islam.‚Äù He was a Muslim in his youth: in The Audacity of Hope he  discusses how he got in trouble for making faces in Quran class. Did he  ever renounce Islam? There is no record of his doing so.

The EU and Britain have  already capitulated to Islamism. There is  no moderate Islam; its core,  Quran is based on terror, nihilism and the  liquidation of non-Muslims. DON'T BE MISLED, "there IS NO "MODERN" iSLAMSolution the total eradication of Islam and all its followers.
declared war on  atheists, Jews &amp; all other Non-muhammadists  &amp; 'kissed' penises  of boys &amp; sucked boys' tongues &amp; lips  (see Wikiislam).	Would a moderate version of Islam mean that an atheist or apostate wouldn't be crucified just banned on social media?
The founder of  Islam, unjust Muhammad burned people for not  praying, declared Africans  slaves, crucified critics, commanded the  forcible lifelong torture of  declitorization of girls, forced theism on  anyone, raped, tortured,  commanded to beat children, promoted  inbreeding
Africans are enslaved, castrated, beaten, killed, Algeria (surge), Mauritania (20  percent), Niger, Mali, Somalia,  Nigeria in emulation of unjust Muhammad  who started the global African  slave-trade by "turning Africans black so  Africans' desc would be slaves to  Arabs &amp; Turks
When confronted with the suffering of people oppressed by Muhammadists they prefer to pray. Africans  are enslaved, castrated, divorced, beaten &amp; killed today in Saudi  Arabia &amp; enslaved in the UAE, Oman, Yemen, Kuwait, Lebanon, Bahrain,  Iraq, North-Sudan, Libya (surge),

The only form of Islam should be a minor note in history from when it was banished from the planet.Islam, in truth, is an apocalyptic Cult of Death feigning religiosity.  It fits, fuses with the doctrine, diktat of Globalism &amp; Progressivism  design to eradicate Western Civiliz.

The whole Russia/Trump conspiracy is now busted as a  criminal  seditious conspiracy against Trump that was attempted by Hillary Clinton over a  dozen  times.
So it's  really looking  like Hillary Clinton's seditious conspiracy against Trump  is now fully  revealed, and James Comey and Obama allowed this illegal  spy ring to  take place after Hillary and her campaign made over a dozen  attempts to  do so.
Clinton attempted over a dozen times to get  the Obama FBI to  conduct  it's illegal FISA spy ring against President  Trump and those  close to  Trump, as Hillary &amp; her campaign exposed now that she tried over 12 times to get FBI to illegally  spy on Trump w/FISA,but failed. .

Meeting for signed commitment to America and The Constitution needed between Cong Dems and Republicans and President Trump. Pelosi is letting her commitments to globalism and communism show. Feeling, that Pelosi no longer favors constitutional republic w/dem guidelines.
The Congressional Democrat Nancy Pelosi is the one to blame for federal workers not receiving pay during government shutdown. SHE is the one preventing these families from receiving their accustomed paychecks. President Trump must CONTINUE TO STAND FIRM. Border wall IMPERATIVE!
Move to replace Nancy Pelosi as speaker of house to get border wall?
Simple answer: Past Gov Jerry Brown/CA Dems had to have a place for all the illegals &amp; migrant Muslims coming soon to every American city &amp; state in America. If Pelosi and Globalists get their way, Muslim migrants will come to America in DROVES. America in the near future. https://t.co/2gilMM7l6o
Remember: DNC (Democrat National Committee) ran a candidate for President of the United States that they knew was fake. Obama not born in United States. Democrats made all Americans live their lie. Same as now. Cong Dems,Pelsosi, faking, they are in process of impeaching Trump.

If President Trump declares National Emergency does it disable Pelosi's power play for imposed gridlock on America which affects President Trump's State of the Union message, Border Wall being built, federal employees getting back to work?
radical liberalism at work. i.e. socio-Democrat party that won't tell voters they are making America a communist state. steadily, propaganda, lies, suspicion, deception, framing our president, censorship, religious bigotry, Soros pd congress members. radicalism. https://t.co/b736kih7MR
Manchin - talk to Pelosi. President Trump has already determined what is needed on the border. It is a Border Wall. We don't have to go back and recreate the wheel here. Pelosi needs to fund the Border Wall now and get these federal workers back to work!

The problem is that there is never an end to the story of the Indian and the red hat boy: Do we hear the truth: The Indian was a scam by the Democrats. He is being charged. The The Hebrews instigating the whole thing..Let's find out who paid  them and charge them. End the Story.
I mean this is a HUGE world. You mean there isn't any news worldwide, locally, to replace the continuous repeting Indian chant, red hat boy. all portraying how the innocent children get taken advantage of in UNITED STATES! How racism, bigotry enables the Evil to take over US.
What kind of media is it that replays the Indian and the red hat boy  on TV for five days, all theatrics displaying our government enable to  do anything about it when a citizen gets sets up, and despite visual  facts, media will tell you what the story REALLY IS.....
THERE is never the END to the story, where people actually are held accountable, arrested, charged, we find who paid them, those people are charged, etc. Instead the same Indian &amp; red hat boy every day for 5 days by media going over same thing, pure scandal news to desensitize us
What kind of government lets Dem Maxine Watters call for physical violence against the Republican congressional members, and then then she gets to head of a most powerful committee in Congress? What kind of government can't impeach this b*    ans: a government run by Democrats

AMAZING: GOP Lawmaker Reveals ‚ÄòPelosi Rule‚Äô That Would Give Trump MAJOR Leverage In Shutdown Talks https://t.co/ogk225q9ka
To be part of the agenda as an American, one must want to work &amp; contribute. Democrats seem to be reveling in hate, division and racism. It is a horrible party. The values are nonexistent. They flaunt lack of ethics and morality as if it was a new Easter dress on Easter Sunday.
If Democrats want to help Americans,  they will negotiate a resolution w/President Trump &amp; end shutdown. But instead, all we hear is Dems procrastination &amp; blaming Trump. Don't elect anymore "do nothing Democrats" into Congress. They don't do squat! They are all talk &amp; no action
The reason most young adults enter college &amp; skilled curriculum is to better themselves, improve their life, make their family proud. Keep it up &amp; vote Trump 2020. President Trump has provided a great economy where jobs are plentiful for everyone. Believe in life's opportunities.
Evil media &amp; congr democrats &amp; anyone who follows them, like rabid vampires smelling blood in the water, so anxious to defeat someone w/harmful rhetoric, by using intimidation &amp; smears to mock &amp; defame. What voter in their right mind would ever vote for such a satanic Democrat?
Congressional Democrats provide NO RESOLUTION to government shutdown. In fact, Congr Dems are the reason there is a government shutdown. The abstinence of a jackass, the prototype of Democrats, jackass's "hee haw." Congress no more helpful to Pres Trump than a barnyard jackass.
A pity Democrats &amp; Republicans fail to work together to COMPROMISE, solve problems in America. Solve this: 40 million Americans struggle w/hunger including 12 million children. Congress is apathetic w/out being apologetic. Congress must solve CRUCIAL problems for Americans.
It is insane to have tents in the streets, human feces just sitting around, to enable disease-prone living conditions, to see used needles left in the street. It is insane to enable persons to live in such conditions. If Democrats are so "progressive," why can't they solve this?

In a country where citizens walk free, we have the globalist arm of the news media stretching into our households daily w/false stories to frame Trump's presidency w/lies &amp; uncertainty. Problem is Americans feel greatness of America again with the leadership of President Trump!
Isn't it a monopoly to have CNN in all airports for example? Doesn't anti-trust prevent monopolies? Lots of times consumers can sue a co because the product is inferior. How can consumers sue false news media for intentionally misleading, spreading fear &amp; insecurity to America?
As if there isn't a regulation for fairness. Companies cannot market a product that is inferior, of poor quality for long, Americans won't buy it. The companies must be reported to Consumer Protection Agency &amp; removed. Hazard to Americans to absorb false news thinking it is true.
Truth is lost in America. Americans trust cable news &amp; printed media to never market false news as truth, but indeed it is done 24/7, to the extent that few media outlets can be trusted. Trust FoxNews. Most of the others publish garbage to trick Americans into thinking T is bad.

HYPNOTIZED.Who first delivered "credible source (dossier inform) to news media, it was FBI, who? After a person hypnotized, the hypnotist can use ONE WORD to put a subject under the influence, ONE WORD to take subject out of hypnosis. ONE WORD to do things, to act certain way.
HYPNOTIZED. via cell phone, via person, hypnotized  to do certain things,  react, key talking points /computer keeps their "hypnotized belief that  any president after Obama is immoral. Hypnotized that anyone trying to do Obama's job is a criminal &amp; Mueller rept will show this.
HYPNOTIZED. They simply can't remember, can't form links of what they were before Obama and now. Hypnotized, The key word dropped, the message delivered, actions, behavior follows. They are hypnotized.

What Pelosi is really saying  "border walls are immoral for Muslims" What she doesn't say "Muslims want to kill Americans who are Christians." She wants to be sure Muslim migrants free flow into USA like in UK. Pelosi is not a lawmaker she is all in on illegals &amp; MIA in America.
Steve King spews white nationalist dialogue &amp; he is out. What about all the other racists on the Democrat side? The outspoken new House women spew racism &amp; bigotry daily, how about the anti-Semite in the House? how about the Muslim &amp; Maxine who advocate death to America, Sharia?
Just withhold paying illegals (at a cost of 115 billion/yr) for 1 month &amp; you pay for the wall. We are under no obligation to pay illegals for being in our country illegally. Withhold payments (115 billion divided by 12 months = +9 billion, even more than President Trump asked 4.

Ari Fleischer states and I agree w/him: "Stop sending silly letters (Pelosi) and compromise. Stop being a security expert and compromise on the border wall. Stop indicating there are security reasons for State of the Union when you know nothing about it. Do your job, Pelosi."
None of this would hv happened if Hillary and Obama were in prison right now. But DOJ/FBI partners in crime. We are dealing with traitors here. Traitors who should be in prison  right now. Since they are not, they are the leaders of the criminal elements within our own government
Congressional Democrats working w/Department of Justice intending to bring anarchy, democracy where spur of the moment law and order, quick &amp; easy impeachment of Trump based on corrupt Mueller Report. Nothing about any of this makes any sense for our constitutional republic.
USA currently ACCOMMODATING gov criminals by ALLOWING an unconstitutional investigation to go on for 18 months. This emboldens the criminals, continues the corruptness with godspeed. Cong Democrats have everyone scared to shut down an unconstitutional investigation. Why is this?
Nothing significantly changes until you cut off the head of the snake which in this case is the Mueller Report - it is the head of the snake, as long as it exists it is the head of the snake on which they hang their hat: Congr Democrats &amp; CORRUPT Justice Dept. Anyone can see this
The current status of USA is a "democracy" and not a constitutional republic. When there is SEVERE CORRUPTION OF DEPT OF JUSTICE OFFICIALS, USA has no equal justice under the law, innocent until proven guilty. There is nothing honorable about allowing criminals to run the country

Americans will not stand for illegal immigrants taking potshots at American citizens and slipping into darkness and coming out to receive our payments then slipping away secretly only to come back and kill and rape Americans. Register all illegal immigrants or they do not get pd!
We will  register these illegals. We need legal immigrants. We will vet these illegals. We will build a border wall on all borders not just the so border. We will make illegals become legal workers once they have been vetted, photographed, vital info collected.
Federal government must have a copy of the state's authority that emboldens sanctuary cities &amp; states to violate the law. They must be fined, banned in disgrace from serving its citizens. All illegal aliens must register, be photographyed, reveal their identity, age, address.
We have a right to know: Who is the illegal immigrant? Age? Family? Driver's License. Remove and expose theses people from the shadows of society. Expose them. Illegal immigrants must register to receive benefits from fed gov. Unless states provide photos, vital stats, no reimb.
We have a right to know who is in our country illegally.We have a right to decide they cannot be in this country. All sanctuary cities, states must be banned. They are a disgrace to this country, reprehensible to citizens. Fine &amp; ban state officials immediately for this behavior.
That is why we regulate who comes in and goes out with passports and visas. We must catalog illegal immigrants who live here, work here, who are they?, the photo, name, age, address, fingerprint, etc. Americans are being killed by illegal immigrants, police are being  targeted!
START NOW:	Change everything about the way illegal immigrants are pd currently. 	No automatic payments. 	No longer will money be automatically deposited onto card. 	Until you register you will not receive any fed gov payments.	Go to Employment Security Commission &amp; register.

Comey the manipulator responsible for preventing Hillary Clinton from being investigated. For her, he weaponized DOJ/ FBI, hatched false Russia collusion, 	appointed SC Mueller. After DNC break in, Hillary TOLD FBI not to take the computers, and they did not take the evidence!
DOJ is a 3rd branch of government, the 1st being the executive branch, the 2nd being the Legislative branch. Historically, each branch tries to tell other branches what to do. That is why AG nominee Barr has no obligation to appease Democrat questioners w/concessions in hearings.
The fact that Hillary Clinton is not behind bars is further evidence of a broken DOJ/FBI. Hillary Clinton must be prosecuted for her actions taken when she was Sec of State. Hillary allowed foreign countries, our foes, to have access to government secrets. Prosecute &amp; Jail HC!
FIRE MUELLER! At last exposing the culpability of traitors in the DOJ/FBI. Trump can fire Mueller. But DOJ/FBI still corrupt as hell so who is going to put  these traitors in prison for life? Since the criminals are the DOJ/FBI, there is no one to put these traitors in prison!
NYT Reveals FBI Retaliated Against Trump For Lawfully Firing Comey https://t.co/ULshKHw2tj
01/12/19 NYTimes article also reveals FBI opened its aggressive, norm-breaking, and unconstitutional  investigation, supposedly into whether Trump ‚Äúworked for the Russians,‚Äù  after he fired Comey and revealed how the agency was playing games with  their spurious ‚ÄúRussia‚Äù probe.
FOR NYTIMES TO SUGGEST THIS MAKES THE PRESIDENT LOOK BAD (INSTEAD OF FBI) validates two of Trump‚Äôs biggest complaints: the media are hopelessly  biased, and there really is a ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù out to to overturn the 2016  election.
Using the completely lawful and constitutional firing of the bumbling  Comey as pretext for opening a criminal investigation into the president  is a grand abuse of power by the FBI. Attempting to USURP POWER OF THE PRESIDENT is a violation of the U.S. Constitution.
When Trump fired Comey, in part for his incompetent handling of  political investigations such as those mentioned in Rosenstein‚Äôs memo,  Rosenstein used that as the predicate to launch what became the special  counsel investigation against Trump.
Article II of the U.S. Constitution gives the authority to determine  foreign policy to the president, not the director or acting director of  the FBI.
It‚Äôs shocking and scandalous that the FBI thinks it should criminalize foreign policy disputes. The FBI argues, without evidence, that the president needed to be investigated as a threat to national security.
The American people get to determine who sets foreign policy, through elections. The FBI does not get to set foreign policy by  running criminal and counterintelligence investigations WITH INTENTION TO HUMILIATE &amp; HARM PRESIDENT &amp; AMERICAN. IMPRISON THESE TRAITORS.
01/12/19 NYTimes article admits there was no evidence and still is no evidence to support Trump worked for Russia.
01/12/19 NYTimes article provides evidence of FBI seizing power to unseat constitutional authority of President Trump to determine foreign policy that belongs not with a politically  unaccountable FBI but with the citizens‚Äô elected president!
Civil liberties of President Trump currently being violated by Mueller Special Counsel. Mueller is a dirty cop. Cong Dems being paid by commie Soros to overthrow America. Comey a dirty cop. Rosenstein a dirty cop.  Dems, DOJ,FBI working w/Soros &amp; against President &amp; Americans.
DOJ &amp; FBI Be Rogue	Mueller FBI Director 12 years	Comey FBI Director 4 years	President Trump fires Comey	Comey illegally appoints Special Counsel in the absence of a crime	Ongoing SC Mueller Investigation to impeach President Trump	Dems know Mueller is rogue	Reps wear blindfolds

A Border Wall &amp; New Immigration Law resolution for 2019. We do not know how many illegal immigrants are in US, it changes every day. Children in border custody 15,000 in Dec 2018, facilities at capacity. Why are Dems, Hillary &amp; Soros sending caravans of ill immigrants to US?

There is no better time than now for Congress to pass a New Immigration Law. The one currently used, is old, used since 1924! Have also heard it takes a long time, about 10 years to get into the US legally. And we need legal immigration now. They want to work. We have jobs!
Illegals R vastly different from legal immigrants.  In hs civics class,social studies, learn the legal immigrants "naturalization" process: Learn English, how USA is governed, what is The Constitution, what is history, what are laws, what are traditions, the culture, your rights?
With a New Immigration Law smarter secure entry into the USA made possible in a decent amount of  time, not 10 years waiting! More legal immigration is accomplished w/New Immigration Law. As it stands now, it takes F O R E V E R to get in legally
?Gov pays Immigration Attorneys to? 	give illegals legal help	how to enter w/guns &amp; drugs?	how to get into USA illegally?	what to say?	how to get lost in system	how not to show up for court?	how to get Medicaid	how to vote	how to work illegally	how to run from ICE	how to get ID
Why would Americans accept news on CNN, MSNBC,ABC,CBS,NBC that is news slanted in favor of Democrats &amp; against Republican President Trump.	1)These Americans have always watched  these channels so continue to do so.	2)They do not know the news they are getting is not based on fact
Stupid to think Dems shouldn't be investigated just bec they  lost in 2016. They lost despite all their illegal acts to destroy Trump. Americans  want these  people prosecuted &amp; imprisoned. Americans do not want our President abused by Dem lawmakers, want justice for the traitors
There just is no  justice that is equal in America. In comparison to President Trump, Congressional Democrats are blithering idiots.Dems want to get rid of him because he outsmarts them every time. He is intuitive &amp; they R intentionally destroying America right before our eyes.
Apparently the sentence for perjury is not significant since so many like Comey ommit perjury yet still walk &amp; talk freely to spread more malicious lies to Americans.	No penalty, no prison  time for news media spreading lies instead of truth?	No penalty,justice 4 any Democrats?
After all, Dems never get prosecuted. Why? Americans are the victims. We have to hear continuously how Dems &amp; liberal media just telling us how Americans elected the most dishonest, the most criminal,  the most deceptive person ever. It is not OK. All America is for Pres Trump.
Have heard many times from Republicans that Mueller has nothing and therefore cannot do anything to Trump, that Dems will have no evidence if  they seek to impeach Trump. Do you know how ridiculous this sounds? Democrats frame, lie,cheat,makeup crimes, do you know that yet?
DOJ &amp; FBI holding America hostage while they frame President Trump. They just need more time for Mueller to come up w/something they can impeach him on. Don't kid yourself. There is only evidence we see is Democrats using government officials to condemn their enemies for them.
Look what has happened since Comey appointed SC Mueller:	Lopsided version of justice where only one party gets to investigate the other	Hillary &amp; Obama have not been investigated &amp; exposed as traitors.	Trump condemned as a criminal from day 1 of his presidency.	Is this justice?

It is all about overturning the vote of the people. There is no justice in this!
Mueller SC Inv is "obstruction of justice" bec just having it's existence portrays wrongdoing. Sinful. Obviously DOJ &amp; FBI were corrupt, criminal &amp; dirty, as are Comey, Mueller, Rosenstein, working for Democrats panting for Mueller report so they can try &amp; impeach our President!

A border wall doesn't hurt anyone so what is the problem? A border wall is being used by 60-70 countries and extremely effective.A cost of 5.6 billion is miniscule when our government has a 4 1/2 trillion dollar budget. Congr Democrats become obsolete like prehistdinosaurs.
Forced to claw their way into the US because US using outdated ineffective Immigration Law of 1924! US WANTS legal immigrants. We need immigrants to come in legally, not claw their way over the southern border. Border Wall will stop criminals from entering &amp; preying on Americans.
President Trump should declare a national emergency:	Congress creates the crisis at the so border. US current immigration law: 1924 Immigration Law. This is the crisis. The border wall applies a band-aid bec illegal immigrants are draining tax payer's $ by exploitation of America
The national emergency is Immigration Law of 1924 is the current immigration law used in the USA. Congress fails for decades to make new Immigration Law. America wants &amp; needs more legal immigrants who are desperate to come  to US.Pelosi shud be working on this rather than Trump

CONG DEMS, Elizabeth Warren might wear her headdress when Nancy wears her hijab, you know, all in the interest of making everyone feel at ease in the political storm you are making, in the middle of one your tricks on Americans. At this  point, you look like you are hiding
Can think of something better than all of that: a bunch of you are going to GITMO to straighten your life out  and learn how to tell the truth for a change.
How to be a traitor CONG DEMS shenanigans when American lives are lost in a domestic terror event, you know like Las Vegas, etc. Saddest thing is CONG DEMS lie like jackasses then try to get in a horse race w/the Budweiser Clydesdales &amp; Trump is racing one to beat their jackass!
No, CONG DEMOCRATS just in middle of the biggest lie in the history of this country. These phonies think they are going to impeach our extraordinary President because he learned to yodel &amp; play Russian Roulette simultaneously at the age of 3 &amp; toilet trained himself at 1 yr.
Some people call what CONG DEMS do "a glitch" pure &amp; simple brought on themselves. We just are saying, "Come Clean," tell us what you've got, don't make us try to figure out what you are really trying to do w/America. Just tell us. You could very well be a traitor already!
What is it CONGR DEMOCRATS are trying to hide from fed gov &amp; from Americans? Dems knew all about the caravans coming to try to get in. Did they say anything to you? anyone? Did CONG DEMS express outrage at Police Corporal Ronil Singh's death by illegal alien?We heard silence.
Been meaning to talk to these CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS about their image. Is Mother Superior Nancy going to appear w/her mink hijab at ALL congressional meetings? Is Elizabeth Warren coming in her mockingbird headdress? Will  there be mats for praying on the floor of the House?
Many of us knew Adam &amp; Eve back in the day. It happened about the time Democrats were trying to walk on water. When Noah's Arc came by to rescue them, they said  they would rather walk. As a consequence now they don't know if they are male or female &amp; think there are 100 genders! https://t.co/JwiDULTh1C
Why are Americans forced to watch our President being humiliated by corrupt DOJ officials, Comey, Mueller, Rosenstein? AG Matt Whittaker must shut down Mueller and fire him, and fire Rosenstein for allowing M to happen. The End.	President Trump must Build the Wall for America!

Instead of having security clearances of government officials worn constantly as vestitures,terminate security clearance when gov employment ends,clearance ends too. Otherwise you have instances likes Biden&amp;Kerry viol the Logan Act &amp;O &amp;Hillary using it to to overthrow government!

Undocumented aliens, better known as ‚Äúillegal immigrants‚Äù STOLE ACROSS  our border as they escaped prosecution in another country.  Whether they  came across with a wife and family or whether they came alone, they are  ALL CRIMINALS UNDER EXISTING LAW!!!

Someone who sneaks across the border is a trespasser not a immigrant.  You are entering  one‚Äôs  land uninvited. They are no different than a  burglar who breaks into your home when you are not around.

President Trump could personally bring charges against the DOJ framing him for a crime he did not commit. His civil rights, freedoms &amp; liberties intact plus his enormous power as President to expose crimes the DOJ committed during campaign 2016 presidential election, &amp;2017,2018!
Charge Huber, Mueller, Rosenstein for withholding evidence of	DOJ framing of President Trump for a crime he did not commit. 	President Trump can personally bring the charge through a US Attorney or federal judge. 	DOJ officials must be imprisoned for Americans to believe in DOJ.
Everyone should be accountable for what they say and do. Particularly like to see Maxine Watters be penalized for her Democrat rant calling for Americans to use physical violence against Trump Cabinet members and this is indeed illegal! https://t.co/FTzZjrl6sq

Women don't let men do the working and bring home the bacon. One reason is that the economy has been so bad for so many years, a two income household was required to survive. No one wanted to have a family for fear they might lose their job. Women had to work so she left the home
Up until the mid 1960's women were content to study home economics in high school and boys studied drafting. Then, there were no jobs in and around where you lived when you graduated so young men when to the city where jobs were located. In doing so, family ties distance severed
Children raised these days are bombarded with horrific unsettling news. Moms went to work instead of staying home to raise their children. Used to be only the movie stars in Hollywood got the divorce. Now, no one even knows how to spell commitment let alone do it.
There is a lot wrong if rate of childbirth in US is the lowest it has been since 1924. Population in 1924 was 114 million.	Population in 2018 was 326 million.	My 2cents is men feel a cold shiver instead of tingles when women are wild and not warm and cuddly.

But wait!  Democrats are pushing for the  elimination  of the  Electoral College and  having presidents chosen by  majority  rule.  Might they call for the same  for all political  decisions?Then, a simple  majority vote, rather than  2/3 majority, to override presidential veto.
If the  House Democrats  were to do  all that they promise to do and  if President  Trump were to  marshal the  guts of Presidents Roosevelt  and Cleveland ‚Äî  both  Democrats, I might add  ‚Äî the next two years  would be a sight to   behold.
It‚Äôs  quite a challenge to override a presidential  veto. President  Franklin  D. Roosevelt was the veto king, with 635. Only  nine of them  were  overridden. President Grover Cleveland vetoed 584  congressional  measures  and was overridden only seven times.	But wait!
For Dems to override Trump‚Äôs veto, Democrats would need to meet the U.S. Constitution‚Äôs  requirement  that they muster 2/3 vote in the House of  Representatives  (290 votes) and a 2/3 vote in the Senate (67  votes). Neither  would be likely.
Dems take control of the House In January. If they were to pass a  measure that Republicans in both houses didn‚Äôt like and President Donald  Trump didn‚Äôt like, either, he could use his veto pen.

Like a third world country, Fascist Democrats, 	threaten to overthrow the President of the United States because they don't like his blond hair. They relist the prospect of 	lying, cheating, corrupt Hillary or Obama to lead the country into communism to kiss up to Putin.
Our Justice Department has become exactly like that of a Third World Country. Thanks to tent cities of illegals who broke the law clawing their way into United States, 	California has made the streets of San Francisco like a third world country with a dictator	unequal law&amp;order
Really, having a justice department that is corrupt is worse than not having one at all: e.g. 	picks &amp; chooses who gets justice; 	makes up a crime &amp; decides a person did the crime, then prosecutes &amp; impeaches that person; 	ignores powerful politicians who do crimes &amp; they go free
Really need President Trump to go through government expenditures with a fine tooth comb. Allegedly there are countless examples of frills and thrills there. For example, Pelosi spending over $100,000 on food &amp; drink as she flies to and from California in any given year.
If you are disrespectful to other people, expect them to disrespect you.	If you act like an idiot, expect to be called an idiot.	If you are telling voters what they want to hear, you are a politician.	If you are a long-term politician, like Pelosi,Schumer, you are corrupt.
Congressional Democrats are eager to cut corners, bend Constitution, make up laws  through questionable court rulings, and  generally abuse the rules and  the Constitution in order to get their  way. Today's Democrats are totalitarian, authoritarian, socialists, commies, fascists
Progressive Liberalism, ililiberalism, say they are great heaters of bigotry yet use bigotry themselves, eager of shut down debates at college to stifle conservationism, make up laws, generally abuse rules &amp; the Constitution. threaten force to maintain power, R commies,fascists.

US Deficit of 20 Trillion. taxpayer funded benevolence. Government mismanaged taxpayer's funds with endless wars in foreign countries. Democrat presidents who offer welfare funds elaborately  to increasing numbers of illegals. Democrat congressmen/women who "stage walkout" resist
Mr. Chuck Schumer apparently wants to play Scrooge in the school play or be a bully in the schoolyard enforcing his own will on others, the type that belittles others, so typically Democrat. President Trump is Santa Claus for America. He has a present for America: a border wall!

US Deficit is over 20 Trillion. Stop going to war without ever declaring war. If you go to war you go for a mission. Once mission is completed you leave. The Pentagon is not above scrutiny. Unending wars in foreign countries, end if not what you thought it was, waste of money.

The US Deficit is more than $20 TRILLION. 	A rising share of unauthorized immigrants have lived in U.S. for more than a decade(Obama 2009-2017). About  two-thirds (66%) of unauthorized immigrant adults in 2016 had been in  the U.S. more than 10 years, compared with 41% in 2007.

Expose the Congressional Democrats for what they are. They are puppets of the globalist elitists who want China in charge of everything, want EU to send as many Muslim migrants into America through "the open borders Chuck Schumer insists America must have!"
CIVIL LIBERTIES: Protected in the Bill of Rights divided into two broad areas: freedoms &amp; rights guaranteed in the First Amendment (religion, speech, press, assembly, &amp; petition) &amp; liberties &amp; rights associated w/crime &amp; due process.Dems physically attack Conservatives.
CIVIL RIGHTS: " basic right  to be free from unequal treatment, based on certain characteristics  which we deem important, like race, gender, &amp; disability,' &amp; civil liberties, which are 'basic freedoms guaranteed by the Bill of Rights."Dems mock &amp; belittle ANYONE w/diff opinion
President still has his civil rights and civil liberties in addition to his presidential powers. Yet, Democrats continually insist President Trump cannot have freedom of speech! Congressional Democrats leading lots of Democrats in Congress into globalism &amp; they don't know it!
Let's be clear America does not want the liberalism the Congressional Democrats are peddling. Civil liberties always violated: look at college campuses where 9/10 colleges, no free speech for Conservatives (Republicans) Liberal teachers berate Trump, teach liberalism &amp; protests!

President Trump's Government Shutdown turns out to be Democrat Chuck Schumer's Shutdown as Schumer fails to produce Democrat votes for the border wall.
As usual Congressional Democrats overplaying their hand &amp;  the stock market is tanking. Congressional Dems all hyped because they got away w/winning 40 House seats in midterms(only by smoke &amp; mirrors!) Thus Dems on fire to impeach President Trump. Dems don't work for America!
Just because House take over by the Dems(because they won midterms fraudulently!) is like the inmates taking over the asylum, don't be alarmed, President Trump will protect the sovereignty of America, fight against globalist takeover, &amp; fight for BW to protect, secure America!
Personally looks like to some that Democrats only supported building the border wall before they began receiving funds from Soros, communist, who hopes to take over US by 2020 (he has stated this. Muslims have stated the same thing). Schumer in pocket of Soros &amp; globalism EU.

Comey gave immunity to Hillary's aides. All sorts of atypical practices. by self-righteous Jim Comey. &amp; Mueller. Hopefully, this narcissism will fail to thrive in prison. There are many in the Obama Adm incl DOJ who are traitors, they R guilty of trying to overthrow USA.
Like Hillary Clinton, they and they alone are the determiners of everyone else's fate. DOJ &amp; Hillary &amp; Obama all wound together in crime &amp; corruption just like a golf ball loaded w/rubber bands bound. There are many Democrats involved, Chuck Schumer &amp; Nancy Pelosi hateful actions
They R traitors. "I don't remember, I don't recall. I don't know. I can't tell you." It is sarcastic &amp; smart alecky. Comey &amp; Mueller so high &amp; mighty don't believe anyone is entitled to ask them ?'s about their actions, behavior;  because only  they are superior &amp; can do that!
The face of the Democrat Party is prejudice &amp; bigotry. It is Hillary's revenge, the continued hate &amp; combative atmosphere as we experienced in election 2016. Hillary can't let go.

80% of Americans want border security. So who are the Democrats trying to please with their refusal to fund the border wall? It obviously is not Americans. Democrats just don't want to give President Trump a victory on the border wall. in the meantime Dems let us all down. https://t.co/1f79IisJW6
Democrats trying to blame everyone but themselves as the problem. Democrats won't let America protect our borders! They are refusing to vote yes on the border wall and forcing President Trump to close the government until they do vote for the funds 5.7 Billion, for the border!
Don't you just have to love Trump, the Deal Maker! With the Border Wall, drama that exhibits how Trump wins by standing for the Border Wall,protection for Americans, Trump will continue to demand a border wall. It is so much needed at porous southern border. Why R Dems opposing?
That is the most beautiful wall I have ever seen. Hey, Democrats, we need U to vote YES on the border wall. All Americans want border security but Democrats don't understand that. All Americans want the border wall to keep out all the drugs, human traffickers, rapists, &amp; killers! https://t.co/Ylv6iQHx0L

If Democrats vote No on border wall funding, the government will shutdown. Dems can prevent a shutdown by voting Yes. Schumer listening too much to his donor, communist Soros. Schumer must know how much money will be saved - at least  200 billion/yr  by not paying illegals in US!
Chuck Schumer doesn't even know what we are talking about. We are talking about a national security issue at the border. America needs a border wall. More than 60 countries have gotten a border wall to protect their country and now America needs a border wall like everybody else

It is always darkest before the dawn.	TRUMP PROTECTS. However, Congress is  tainted w/Democrat abuse: tried to frame Trump for a crime; 50 yrs of election fraud, lies, many paid by commie Soros, Dem congress composed of corrupt politicians, Democrat socialists, commies, Muslims.
Blame or not, Senator Minority Leader,Chuck Schumer is going to be responsible if Democrat Senators vote YES on border wall funding, or 	if Democrat Senators vote NO on border wall funding and 	produce a government shutdown. 	? is will Chuck vote yes for America or No w/Soros!
Democrats have to take the blame for the shutdown even though President Trump says he will take the blame but it is the Democrats who are refusing to vote YES on a $5.7 Billion Border Wall Bill. Schumer should avoid a government shutdown and vote YES for the bill!
It will be a sad day for America if Democrats vote NO on the $5.7 Billion Border Wall Bill.  More than 60 other countries have a border wall, many did this following 09/11! Drugs &amp; human traffickers will be prevented from coming into US. Dems can avoid gov shutdown by voting YES.
Democrats  will be blamed for the shutdown because Democrats have to vote YES for 5.7 Billion for Border Wall to avoid gov shutdown. Strengthen, replace our flimsy border wall. A strong border wall prevents drugs &amp; human traffickers from entering our country. Dems must vote YES. https://t.co/C1AQoRLSrl

Democrats are the ones resisting legislation for the border wall. They are the ones to blame if there is a government shutdown. They are on TV trying to mock President Trump for wanting a border wall. It is truly sickening.
Schumer and Pelosi talking the loudest trying to convince people they are the good guys but they are actually the bad guys for not voting to secure America. No excuse to not fund the border wall. Schumer &amp; Pelosi are cantankerous old fools and won't let Trump build border wall.
Democrats Schumer and Pelosi are trying to blame Trump for shutting down the government for the border wall. Americans understand why. President Trump needs to protect Americans from illegal immigrants coming over the border. Schumer &amp; Pelosi Democrats will not vote for wall!!!!!
Democrats Schumer and Pelosi will not give funding for the border wall. President Trump wants to protect  the country with a border wall. Sixty countries have a border wall &amp; it works great. President Trump needs Democrats to fund wall. Schumer &amp; Pelosi are cantankerous old fools
Democrats are the ones who will be voted against for not supporting President Trump's border wall. Democrats will have to take full blame for the government shutdown - if they don't give money for border wall, Democrats are the bad guys on President Trump!
Lindsay Graham is a good example of how long his loyalty to the President lasts. President Trump knows the troops. It is President Trump's decision to withdraw from Syria because the mission has ended. Everyone has their opinion no matter if it exposes such flimsy character, LG.
Who is the custodian of the 20 trillion debt that is America? President Trump. It is impossible to do things like in the past. Look at our debt! We need to concentrate on making America stronger, protecting America, getting rid of our debt &amp; no more troops dying in foreign land.
Those who are against withdrawing troops from Syria want America to keep being policeman of the world. America has in excess of 20 Trillion Debt. Only Democrats like to throw away money. Republicans do not. Also, Syria is not our war despite our presence. Our mission is over.
Remember if Democrats could lynch President Trump they would. Abraham Lincoln was shot by Wilkes Booth who said, "What an excellent chance I had, if I wished, to kill the President on Inauguration day!" This is the demonic Democrat party as expressed by Pelosi &amp; Schumer,etc.
Remember Dems are full of tricks and their lies are as long as from your shoulder to your fingers. The obscenity of it is the Congressional Democrats thinking President Trump will ever do anything their way. Why? They don't stand for the rule of law as in the Kavanaugh Hearing
Didn't like at all giving money to Central American countries, hopefully the President hasn't signed it and won't sign it. This was a sign for me that President Trump is under obscene pressure from congressional democrats to play  their game of status quo. Stop it. Rem our debt.
Congressional Democrats are all fart and no movement.	Congressional Democrats have been "resisting for the past two years."	and now they screech, threaten.	Republicans are the honest ones here and protect America.	We are going to get a border wall or Democrats will get nothing.
President Trump has no problem with standing up for what he believes, says what he believes, does what he believes. Don't let the nasty Congressional Democrats get away with anything. President Trump will fight for what he believes. President Trump is strong, smart, right on BW.
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Remember Congressional Democrats always complain about everything. Time for the good guys to stand up to the bad guys. The Democrat gang vs the Republican gang. Democrats beat you up, get their way, unless the good guys stand up and fight!! https://t.co/tVByznyqHK
As always Democrats screech the loudest. These black crows feed on the frenzy and hope to upset everything w/impeaching Trump. Why should the good birds have to be intimidated by the crows? No reason. The reason: Not enough good men standing up to the bad guys.
AG pick William Barr is right. Of course Democrats don't want him. AG Barr is a fantastic pick to get our country's serial offenders of justice: Democrats, Hillary, Obama, DOJ, Obm officials, etc. Our country is in BAD shape bec Democrats are covering up their own illegalities!
Don't pass anything Democrats want until you get $25 billion for border wall. There is NOTHING more important than keeping America from paying more than $200 billion/yearly supporting illegals who have clawed their way into our country, illegals affect safety of our kids w/drugs.
The question is why should President Trump have to "move money around in order to get the border wall?" President Trump is president and he presides over the national security of America. President Trump says we need a border wall. Nothing hard to understand about that.
All Democrats are going with their illegitimate win of 40 seats in the House is to destroy our President, execute their coup, let all Democrats off the hook for all their criminal acts before, during, and present, to President Trump. Americans want DOJ to represent justice.
What is important is not backing down on your promise to the American people. Pres Trump promised a Border Wall. Democrats won't let him have it. President Trump must stand strong, not back down, get the border wall. America will never have a border wall if you don't do it now.
Every mission  must have an end, i.e. Syria. What? We are supposed to keep our thumb on button in Syria forever? 	ans: it will protect us here in America?	ans: Iran will take over Syria and eventually go after Israel?	ans: Iran will get stronger?	ans: America always does this?
Don't give us on the border all, America must have it.	Illegals cost money. US will go bankrupt like Venezuela	Illegals take jobs, influence our children in school, make life precarious for Americans by raping, killing and distributing drugs	Americans want the safety of border w.
No one really mentioned Democrats are out to control Americans - control your money, your life with more rules and laws, all to make you dependent on LARGE GOVERNMENT. Media spreads propaganda for Democrats. It is socialism. Socialism &amp; Democrats lead to COMMUNISM in America.
Trump Supporters will never leave President Trump. We see his heart. He is a good man.	Mueller is a partisan working for Hillary and Congressional Democrats.	If Democrats wanted to make America strong,  they would not be acting in only their own interests and mocking USA success.
Trump Administration turning out the lights on Democrats  trying to impeach President Trump. 	Democrats are playing Political Game called HATE and CORRUPTION.	Game is called "Watch what we can do to you."	"we lost the election and you control us"	"but watch us as we control you!
China needs to be kicked out of the World Trade Organization (WTO). They have shown no intention of correcting their behavior stealing of intellectual secrets from US, instead cyberhacking, bugs in computers &amp; cell phones sent from China to US. China not honest trade partner.
You can bet Hillary is behind everything. The more I understand the Democrats I understand  they follow the leader and are impressed by Hillary's wealth &amp; they are always broke so they always need her to bail them out. Heaven help us if Maxine Waters is in control of gov dollars
Dec 22 the report comes out on the election fraud that occurred in midterms 2018. The Democrats got their 40 seats in the House  through fraud which is ill-gotten gains to impeach our President. They want to rig elections to win, hardly the gold standard we expect from lawmakers.
When you have the shutdown, make sure the lights are turned off in the Legislative branch of government also. No reason to have this branch investing and impeaching Trump, if you can prevent this unseemly practice. As Nadler said, not right when only one party wants it.
There is no reason for President Trump to sign any bills if he doesn't get $25 billion for a border wall. There is no reason for President Trump to have to bow to Democrats on anything. Democrats have to realize Republicans can play this game  too. Hence, the shutdown.
But Syria did not ask for our help. Assad placed the future of Syria w/Russia &amp; US could talk w/Russia &amp; Syria w/talks. Does Syria want to be the new Iran? Why did Russia's help lead Syria to this point? Syria &amp; Russia &amp; US must meet. The first time, US leaving when mission done.
Let us be clear on how bad it is in Washington. We have Congressional Democrats working w/the enemy against America. They do not spit on the anticipated takeover of America by Muslims &amp; Soros by 2020, the illegals clawing to get in, the Dems endorse the destruction of America!

The fact is God does not negotiate w/ the Devil. God just stands up &amp; wins &amp; all the glory is his. God is a loving God. God does not mock others. That is how you tell the difference. We have the mockers in charge in January 2019. The government's legislative body is dysfunctional
Consult as always with everyone: experienced lawmakers like Hatch, religious figures to explain the fight of good and evil active today in our government. Stand with God &amp;fear of what will happen if you do something, is just another opportunity to prove America is God's Country.
How America blew itself up with hate. January 2019 with the haters in charge is what happens when  the inmates are in charge of the asylum. Shut down government. Bring in the military tribunal to try the sedition of hate represented by HC, Congressional Democrats, Obama, DOJ.
What happens when the destroyers of America use our own laws to turn against America and destroy it, the destroyers of America are in charge of our destiny - Congressional Democrats and Crooked DOJ, the destroyers of America.
Hillary and Democrats run free to persecute Trump without reprimand, without justice for the haters. How America blew itself up with hate will be the next movie about America. How American culture became the hate culture. It is America with a crooked DOJ, selectively punishing.
America today is what happens when the HATE CULTURE has taken over - Nancy Pelosi is the figurehead as we march toward January 2019. Hate movement authored by Hillary Clinton (still not in prison, never even disciplined,) the hero of hate leading it all. Imprison Her Immediately.
Surely, we must leave when we are finished with Trump's mission in Syria &amp; anywhere. President Trump's decision to act.
Pulling out of Syria is the right thing to do. Wish we could pull out of Afghanistan and Iraq too. America has a big national debt. Let our troops come home. We need more heroes in our society mingling around with devil worshipers. God will win. Save our troops afar from death.
Standing up for something good like the Border Wall is essential for President Trump. Americans believed him during the campaign when he said he would build a Border Wall. Don't let us down now. Stand firm until you get the Border Wall, not a pc tense, GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN until $
The Federal Reserve is trying to break things, another raise in the interest rate? 7th time? come on. Stop being so cautious, Trump appointee, NO ONE has understood Trump's magic touch. So federal reserve cool it. What you trying to do make things the way they used to be?
so heard on TV how "divisive things are, never seen it so in Abraham Lincoln &amp; there was a civil war after that &amp; lots of people died," Well guess what? Let's be specific. Don't blame Republicans. We are happy people. The Democrats are the haters who lash out w/out reason. Cheers
When there are no "facts"  to convict, Special Counsel Mueller squeezes associates close to the "target" by  threatening expansive prison time unless they can furnish information harmful to the "target." It is like selling your soul to the devil, giving Mueller what he wants.

Congressional Democrats think they are going to impeach Trump. Think again. You are asking for civil war which might not be a bad idea, in fact might be a grand idea. It will be Trump's America vs Resistance Nazi sympathizers. Too many commies in gov that need to be impeached!
Trump should state $25 billion is the magic number for the border wall. As long as the line is drawn for a shutdown ask for $25 billion before government reopens. We spend in excess of $300 billion/yr on supporting the illegals who come across our border. Still a big saving!
Government shutdown is right on target. Of course, there is no greater cause than to keep America safe. America is not safe with illegals streaming across our border at will and border agents getting killed trying to prevent them.Also, illegals bring the scourge of drugs,killings

Comey was on the hot seat today answering questions. Hopefully he answered questions today better than before. Comey is the reason Hillary is not in prison, but that is just one problem w/Comey. Comey should be in prison too. That is why he had to have a SC so Mueller cud sav him
