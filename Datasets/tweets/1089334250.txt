The #SchumerShutdown is over. My take: https://t.co/aHPOHoLiBl
The Senate votes at noon to reopen the government. Will @SenateDems continue to block funding?  Or will they end their #SchumerShutdown?  I hope they do the right thing.
Remember when Democrats were against government shutdowns? We do. Buckle your seatbelt. We're about to take a trip back to 2013 &amp; 2014 so we can hear from Democrats themselves. #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/2ZMTyOJSDq
It’s now been 40 hours since the beginning of the #SchumerShutdown. The House has done its job. Now it’s time for @SenateDems &amp; @SenSchumer to do theirs by opening the government and providing resources for our military and children that rely on CHIP. https://t.co/qPh9r6JRM8

Last night, Senate Democrats made the choice to strip funding from the Children's Health Insurance Program and deny our troops the support they deserve through the #SchumerShutdown. This is reckless, irresponsible, and wrong. https://t.co/3JgTdoQ7A4
RT @HouseGOP: Flashback to when @SenSchumer thought a government shutdown was reckless. https://t.co/mwcrAZpEtU https://t.co/UExHcTofFF
Reminder: A government shutdown will put national security interests and military readiness at risk. House Republicans voted to keep the government open last night, but @SenateDems are obstructing. Why do they prefer #SchumerShutdown to standing with our troops?
Reminder: House Republicans passed a 5-year CHIP reauthorization on November 3, 2017. @SenateDems obstructed. We also passed a 6-year CHIP reauthorization yesterday with government funding. @SenateDems are obstructing. Why do they prefer #SchumerShutdown to healthcare for kids?
Reminder: House Republicans passed all 12 appropriations bills for the current fiscal year ahead of schedule - over 5 months ago. The Senate has not passed a single one because 60 votes are required &amp; @SenateDems obstructed. That is why we are now facing #SchumerShutdown.
The House passed legislation to keep the government open - so why are we on the brink of a shutdown? Because @SenSchumer is stalling over an artificial DACA deadline.

this bill 2 #StopGovtAbuse &amp; hold unelected bureaucrats accountable lays the groundwork for new jobs, more freedom, &amp; expanded opportunity
I voted for the #StopGovernmentAbuse Act bc it's an imp bill in fight to protect our freedoms from a constantly expanding federal govt #KY6
I cosponsored HR 2009, a simple, 2 page bill that prevents the #IRS from enforcing Obama’s takeover of healthcare #stoptheIRS
Healthcare decisions should be made by patients, families and doctors, not Washington and especially not the IRS #stoptheIRS
The IRS has already proven it is unwilling or unable to fairly enforce laws. We can’t trust them to fairly implement healthcare #stoptheIRS
#REINSAct restores accountability 4 federal agencies writing regulations with economic impact of $100mil #RegReform
Allowing the IRS to enforce #Obamacare opens the door to more abuse, targeting and harassment of Americans. #stoptheIRS
The #REINSAct will restore oversight on the Obama Administration’s unelected, unaccountable federal bureaucrats #PJNET
When it comes to our healthcare decisions, we shouldnt have to answer to an agency that just forfeited its claim to impartiality #StoptheIRS

The #REINSAct will ensure better laws and fewer bad regulations that hurt #KY6 families and #smallbiz
When it comes to an individual’s personal healthcare decisions, no American should be required to answer to the IRS. #stoptheIRS
We need the #REINSAct to keep the executive branch from legislating through regulation #PJNET
I support H.R. 2009 which prevents the #IRS from implementing or enforcing #Obamacare #stoptheIRS
We need legislation like the #REINSAct to keep the executive branch from circumventing the legislative branch
#REINSAct restores #accountability from fed agencies by requiring more scrutiny of regulations that would have &gt;$100mil economic impact
