5/6 And what is current US policy re Russia? The Russian ambass in Wash is shunned, unable even to secure meetings. But we need channels &amp; we need objectives. For nights like tonight ‚Äî &amp; nights for the rest of time ‚Äî the US needs a Russia strategy. Mixed msgs are disastrous.
4/6 But now what? General Mattis, Chairman Dunford &amp; the US military do their jobs brilliantly. But can anyone on earth define US policy toward Syria? Since Trump took office, there hasn‚Äôt been a single serious, sustained diplomatic initiative aimed at ending the war.
3/6 At one point some hoped that Iran ‚Äî its own soldiers once gassed by Iraq ‚Äî might press #Assad to cease CW use. But now, years into Assad‚Äôs serial use, Iran &amp; Russia are completely complicit in Assad‚Äôs ‚Äúwin at any cost, win with any weapon‚Äù strategy.
