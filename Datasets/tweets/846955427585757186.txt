@ChiefHubbaBubba @BernieSanders Salaries of universities' administrators has ballooned, and accreditation agencies, who have a financial interest in keeping supply low as demand increases, have all contributed to this.
@ChiefHubbaBubba @BernieSanders In 2016, the median income for men was $40445 in Dec. 2017 dollars ($38,869 unadjusted) and $25,901 in Dec. 2017 dollars ($24,892 unadjusted) for women, making public college costs 51.8% of men’s median income and 80.9% of women’s median income per year.
@ChiefHubbaBubba @BernieSanders The median income in 1971 for men was $42,757 in Dec. 2017 dollars ($6,903 unadjusted) and for women was $14,915 in Dec. 2017 dollars ($2,408 unadjusted), making public college costs 20.4% of men’s median income and 73.7% of women’s median income per year.
@ChiefHubbaBubba @BernieSanders In 1971 the tuition, fees, room, and board per year for a public 4-year college was $8,734 in Dec. 2017 dollars ($1,410 unadjusted). By 2016 the cost had risen to $20,967 per year in Dec. 2017 dollars ($20,150 unadjusted), a 140.1% increase.

@mkeelanbishop @kylegriffin1 Nor do I. My point is that having this fight in this way is hurting the very people these Representatives are supposed to protect. The only things that gets hurt in Washington are egos. Out here, people are BEING FORCED TO WORK WITHOUT PAY.
@mkeelanbishop @kylegriffin1 I think the wall is ridiculous. I think the Orange Menace is dangerous. But, $5.7B is 0.14% of the $4T budget.

@kylegriffin1 At this point, does it matter who is to blame? They're ALL wrong when people are being FORCED to work without pay, with no idea when this madness will end.  BOTH sides' insistence on taking a "principled" approach is ruining lives. 		Enough is enough
