@dev24_mikaela @benshapiro It's not just about an opinion. It's about a pattern. We are in a misinformation war if you hadn't noticed. As info wars says. There is a battle for your mind. Not a big fan but he's right about that one.
@dev24_mikaela @benshapiro And Trump is too popular for these types to come right out and be negative all the time. He says things here and there and then really sticks the knife in. In some cases really reaching.
@dev24_mikaela @benshapiro I'm also not alone in this theory. There are many like minded individuals who are Trump supporters.
@dev24_mikaela @benshapiro That's just my opinion. I could be wrong. Never know.
@dev24_mikaela @benshapiro Like I said, I think he's a lot like McCain and those other RINOs like the Bush family. I don't think he's on our side really.
@dev24_mikaela @benshapiro He's a con artist. I think he's a paid shill for the Elites.

@ChavezIsBored Always.
@ChavezIsBored And as long as that is true there will be people who use people's differences to drive a wedge between them. You have to always remain vigilant. Because even in a situation like this they are using these issues to drive a false narrative to divide us here in the US.

@cmclymer If anyone is heard bad mouthing the CINC. I promise you they will get their ass scuffed up. They'll be PTed until the leader throws up. Not the solder being PTed.
@cmclymer Let me make this very clear. It doesn't matter who the CINC is. He is the leader of the armed forces. He is the commander of all Military Units. The chain of command is highly respected. PERIOD. You don't have to respect the individual but you DAMN WELL RESPECT THE RANK.
@hairmich42 @cmclymer You are a liar and a troll. Good bye.
@ChavezIsBored I've experienced and been a part of the military, first hand, my entire life. There might have been an issue in the past. Not now. And there are issues that arise but they get dealt with. Racism is not tolerated.
@ChavezIsBored The military is made up of roughly 50/50 white/non-white individuals. Your entire chain of command is filled with a mixture or all ethnic backgrounds from your team leader to your 1ST SGT. They are the ones who interact with the troops day in and day out. https://t.co/nXq90P4lxo
@ChavezIsBored I live it. I don't need to read shit.
@DearDean22 @cmclymer white team. The racial mix is thorough. And when you join a unit or platoon it's like joining a family. You can't get away from each other. If issues arise they get dealt with. They don't shape up they get kicked out. PERIOD.
@DearDean22 @cmclymer It's kinda hard to say there is a racism issue in the military when half the people in the m military aren't white. There are typically 4 platoons to a company. 4 squads to a platoon. 2 teams to a squad.  4 team mates to a team. with 1 squad leader. I've never once been on a all

@thsadtrth @ChavezIsBored @PDXJulia @Ducks1stLife2nd @cmclymer The government/DOD are actively working to find these types of individuals and thro them out. They are also working really hard to screen these individuals out before they even get in. The military is doing the right things these days. For anyone to say otherwise is FULL OF SHIT.

But then you also have those that enter into the military that hide themselves. They are gang members looking for training to use outside the military.
@thsadtrth @ChavezIsBored @PDXJulia @Ducks1stLife2nd @cmclymer Being in a platoon or unit is like becoming a part of a family. You are forced to be close to each other for long periods of time.

@scib0rg Hey South Texan here. I don't deal with Orientals very often. Mostly Hispanics. And I'm not one for PC culture. I try to be polite but that's about it.
@scib0rg Everybody got shit on equally.
@scib0rg I don't need to. Like I said I know first hand. I lived it day in and day out.
@scib0rg You refuse to listen to first hand knowledge and your arrogance is beyond measure. You are the stereotypical liberal bullshit pusher. You think you know everything and refuse to listen to experience or logic. You are a moron. Go away.
@scib0rg a Veteran about the military that you have never been in. That's pretty fucking arrogant and stupid.
@scib0rg officers. The officers have become more diverse but it's the NCOs that deal with the troops first hand and who are the first line supervisors. See here's your problem. You continue to argue with someone who has first hand knowledge. You are a civilian who is actively arguing with
@scib0rg This might be true however in my last Battalion my BN Commander was black and there are four companies to a Battalion.

@scib0rg This is no longer true. https://t.co/5uaFie3bWh
@cocozzello @cmclymer Does that mean it doesn't happen at all? No, it happens but they can only deal with it as it presents itself. Is there massive amounts of people coming into the military that are racist? There are no great amounts of racists coming into the military that's bullshit.
@cocozzello @cmclymer don't last. They come n as kids. Childish and cocky. They either change in the first couple of years in the service they get kicked out. If they act out in a racist manor they will be kicked out. So no there is no issue of racism in the military . They deal with it properly.
@cocozzello @cmclymer What I'm talking about is in the past racism was tolerated. These days there is no issues of racism being tolerated. That's a fact. The majority of those in the military are not racist. What I mean by that is that yes there are some racists that make it into the military but they
@scib0rg they stay in for an extended period of time they are typically of the same mentality as I am. We don;t tolerate BULLSHIT.
@scib0rg the military. They don't last. They either change or they get kicked out. The military structure cannot afford that kind of behavior. We have childish individuals that come in at 18. They have to be educated, broken down and taught. They either change or they get kicked out. If
@scib0rg the way to the top. Racism is no longer allowed. We have a 0 tolerance policy that is strictly enforced. You don't have a clue because you have never been in the military. I'm telling you, that you have no argument here. Yes there are people whohave some racist ideas coming in
@scib0rg Please I have eyes. I have ears. I have been around the military my whole life. The way things use to be are not the way they are today. Again the military is made up of a very diverse group of people and the command structure is has a lot of people of color now inside of it all

@PDXJulia @ssimmons1187 @Ducks1stLife2nd @cmclymer It's no longer 1946.

A black president who could never have gotten elected without the white vote. So ya get over it. This bullshit
@scib0rg You have no clue as to what I've experienced. There you go with that false narrative thing again.
@DelanyDean @onedankmom @cmclymer Especially when you are active duty.
@DelanyDean @onedankmom @cmclymer Are there people who come into the military with racist mentalities? Yes, they don't last or they change. It is squashed these days. You have an issue with someone in your command you take it to your IG. If you have to you call you state representative. They take your calls.
@DelanyDean @onedankmom @cmclymer real issue. People want to push these false narratives and when it comes to the military I'll make sure you know you're wrong real quick.
@DelanyDean @onedankmom @cmclymer in front of everyone for being an ass to me. My battalion commander for 1-14th IN BN was black. Lieutenant Colonel Mundel. He was a good guy. See the command structure of our modern day military is filled with people of color. So it would be kinda hard for it to flourish or be a
@DelanyDean @onedankmom @cmclymer It is no longer over looked. Our military is highly diverse. I have served personally under two black men. My 1ST SGT in my first company was black. He looked out for me. He was the only one in the company as old as I was. He had my platoon SGT at parade rest and scuffed him up
@DelanyDean @onedankmom @cmclymer And like I've been telling others it's more like an issue of gangs coming in and getting training. The government knows about it and are trying to take care of that. Now as far as general racism. There is a 0 tolerance policy in the military. It is no longer swept under the rug.
@DelanyDean @onedankmom @cmclymer Look at her account. It was a joke.

@Roxanne59632009 &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Got a fake account here guys.
@iNHeR_oNNa Just like any civilian job, there are avenues to take if you think there has been some form of prejudice been made against you. The military takes any claims very seriously.
@iNHeR_oNNa People do skate by and there are some racists in the military but if they are only there simply because they don' let anyone know. They know it's not tolerated.
@iNHeR_oNNa One Battalion that I was in the commander was black. Our command structure is filled with people of color these days. So to say that it's a big problem or an issue is an out right lie. Racism is just not tolerated in the military any more.
@iNHeR_oNNa enough they will find themselves outside of the military real quick. The narrative here is that it's a problem in the military. That's just not true. We have a very diverse military these days. I've never been in a platoon that wasn't made up of a large mix of ethnic backgrounds.
@iNHeR_oNNa Don't get me wrong. There are individuals that join that have mild racist mentalities. That's not however the norm or is any form of racism allowed to happen in the military. If someone acts out in a racist manor they will find themselves in some hot water real quick. If it's bad
@iNHeR_oNNa That is the current trend of issues that the military is fighting. People associated with various gangs and criminal entities are sending their people eto join combat mos and intel jobs to learn how things work and get training.

@hello_nathaniel @Hewdaman @cmclymer Let me explain a little something to you.

@hello_nathaniel @cmclymer Like I said it is not allowed and is taken care of these days and it is not wide spread. Yes, there will be those who skate by but for the most part it gets squashed.

@PDXJulia @ChavezIsBored @Ducks1stLife2nd @cmclymer Like I said before. It is no longer ignored. It is no longer swept under the rug. It cannot be allowed for the sake of the mission and unit cohesion. Does it happen. Yes but it is isolated cases and when ever any issue comes to light it is taken care of. There are many of people
@ChaosStrategery @cmclymer Military regs have nothing to do with racism. There are many in command who are black and Hispanic.
@cocozzello @cmclymer There are roughly 2,083,100 military personnel currently serving. And I promise you that the majority of them are not racist. I can also assure you that if it comes to light that any of them are racists and or connected to racist groups they will be dealt with.
@cocozzello @cmclymer Your snide bullshit remarks hold no value here. There are individuals that fall through the cracks. However anytime this comes to light it gets taken care of ans is not a wide spread issue. This was just one individual out of how many military personnel?
@ChavezIsBored @PDXJulia @Ducks1stLife2nd @cmclymer Historically there was an issue, but those days a long gone.
@ChavezIsBored @PDXJulia @Ducks1stLife2nd @cmclymer You just made my point. It's not tolerated. When it comes to light it gets squashed. It cannot thrive in the military. And it will not be allowed to thrive. Thee people are saying it's a wide spread issue that's being allowed. That's just bullshit.
@robinlmira @cmclymer quiet. We as soldiers in combat MOSs cannot tolerate that kind of bullshit. The military command understands this and combats it every single day. So for someone to say there is wide spread, un-dealt with racism in the military is just full of shit.
@robinlmira @cmclymer unfortunate in having been in a unit that was going through issues but in general the military deals with this issue these days. It is no longer allowed. There is no wide spread issue of racism in the military. With today's social awareness, people of color don't sit by and keep
@robinlmira @cmclymer No, it's no longer swept under the rug unless you allow it. Again if you were around individuals that allowed it you were a part of the problem. When ever it gets brought to the chain of command and taken up that chain of command it gets dealt with these days. You might have been
@amb573 @PDXJulia @Ducks1stLife2nd @cmclymer You're full of shit. I'm not even going to try and show others what Stolen Valor looks like. I'm just blocking you.
@Hewdaman @hello_nathaniel @cmclymer https://t.co/f1ud3udqjM
@robinlmira @cmclymer This includes Bloods/Crips/Mexican Cartel Affiliated groups/and White Supremacists. The military actively works to take care of this issue. It is not allowed to just be tolerated and it's not wide spread. Anyone who tells you otherwise is full of shit.
@robinlmira @cmclymer It becomes an issue if you don't deal with it. And it isn't that we have a racism issue at this point but a gang issue trying to use the military to get training.
@robinlmira @cmclymer Like I said. It cannot be allowed to exist. Not that it doesn't happen. When it comes to light it gets dealt with. If you allow that shit to happen then it breaks down the entire unit and it becomes ineffective. This soldier was saying it's an issue. IT's not. We deal with it.
@Hewdaman @hello_nathaniel @cmclymer I didn't say people don't fall through the cracks. I said it's not tolerated. When information comes to light it gets dealt with. NEXT.
@robinlmira @cmclymer heard him talking like that again he'd be having some serious issues real quick. So if you had as issue with racism in you chain of command ,then you were a piss poor soldier.
@robinlmira @cmclymer If you allowed racism to thrive, then you have an issue not me. I would never let someone in my unit get away with that bullshit. I'd call em out in a heart beat. I for one made sure a PVT understood that when he said something derogatory about the locals in Hawaii that if I ever
@PDXJulia @Ducks1stLife2nd @cmclymer I understand the mentality and the need for unit cohesion. I understand the need to be able to rely on those around me for the safety of my own skin. What part of that don't you get?
@PDXJulia @Ducks1stLife2nd @cmclymer You have no clue as to what you are talking about. And if you claim to have served you better be ready to back it up. Otherwise ask questions and I'll explain. I know what I'm talking about. The military has evolved.
@PDXJulia @Ducks1stLife2nd @cmclymer Look. I have been a part of the military my entire life. Both of my grandfathers served in WWII. My father served more than 20. My cousin is an SF medic who is a CMD SGT MAJ at this point. I entered into the military in 2002. IF you are not in the military or have never served.
@Ducks1stLife2nd @Scairp114 @cmclymer Historical being the key word there moron.
@ceehope @cmclymer Something tells me you never served in the military. Use Stolen Valor much?
@hello_nathaniel @cmclymer not tolerate it. It effects morale and unit cohesion. For the military to allow it to fester would only degrade the effectiveness of the military. That effects the mission. Not going to happen.
@hello_nathaniel @cmclymer You worked on military installations? Did you actually serve? And was this back in the day like 30 years ago? Today's military is different. There have and will always be minor issues. There's no way to avoid it. However we don't allow it to fester and grow. We cannot and will
@nativecary I'm* not going to allow that shit. I promise you that.
@nativecary I am in no way a art of any problem. I was part of the solution. You don't get it. If I didn't handle issues that involved the unit and make sure we were a strong team my life would have been in greater jeopardy. If I can't trust the guy to my left or right I get killed. I not
@NewTexCub About 70% of my followers are Veterans.
@NewTexCub If you look through my followers you will find that I have generals to lower enlisted and SF of every branch to support of every kind. The military has come a long way. We have issue with PTSD and gangs infiltrating the military and they are actively dealing with this.
@Ducks1stLife2nd @Scairp114 @cmclymer Not only do I believe that to be true but if you look through my followers they mostly do too. Take a minute to research them. I have generals to lower enlisted. SF of every branch to support of every kind that follow me. The majority of my followers are military veterans.
@robinlmira @cmclymer If you want to talk to me then you need to make your points properly. I never said there weren't racists that get into the military. I said we get rid of them. Same with any discrimination or bigotry. We don't need the added issues.
@Scairp114 @cmclymer mentally capable, safe to own and to carry a weapon. Your ignorance is showing here. Take some time and learn what you are talking about before trying to debate me. If not I'll just block you.
@Scairp114 @cmclymer You need to read that bill and what it was doing. It was unconstitutional. I've researched it. You don't know what you are talking about. It has nothing to do with mental issues. It has to do with people not being bale to get their name off a list even if a doctor found they are
@cmclymer a continued issue with that. There's not much more the military can do about this particular issue. The fact is that the military has come a long way on dealing with this.
@cmclymer an issue then a doctor might as well be trying to use a crystal ball to diagnose the severity a veteran is dealing with. Unfortunately the mentality of those who serve tends to lead them to not admitting they have an issue. I'm too tough to die type of mentality. So there will be
@cmclymer normal life.  Then there are those that have serious issues and it affects every part of their life. There's typically only one individual that has the ability to see where they're at most of the time, and that's the person with the PTSD. If they don't own up and say hey, I have
@cmclymer kind of criminal record. The fact is that sometimes people and issues they have fall through the cracks. I believe the military has tried to make sure that doesn't happen very often. And yes, PTSD is an issue but it varies in degrees. Some people have mild issues and live a
@cmclymer As far as the military not reporting mental issues as the reason for separation or spousal abuse I believe has been dealt with. Anyone who has a history of mental issues cannot legally own a gun. Same thing goes for people with a history of spousal abuse. They should have some
@cmclymer Military life isn't for everyone. We do the best we can to remove whatever distractions that come up no matter the issue. Otherwise it cost lives. This includes racism and bigotry. Unfortunately that also includes some life style choices. The price we pay is just too high a cost.
@cmclymer So I'm sorry if you have issues with the military Charlotte. Get over it. This is what war is. It's not pretty. We don't need distractions. People die. https://t.co/mhPvLr8Wfd
@cmclymer don't have unit cohesion, people die. I lost way too many of my Brothers and Sisters under ideal conditions. I will not allow the mission and them to be compromised because of these outside issues getting in the middle of the mission. https://t.co/QLBllOwSlL
@cmclymer doesn't matter. We cannot afford these types of issues to distract us from the mission. The number one thing you learn in the military. THE MISSION ALWAYS COMES FIRST. Period. And we have to be able to look out for the person to our left and right and be able to trust them. If we
@cmclymer Being in the military is about being a part of something bigger than ourselves. It calls for sacrifice and dedication. We don't have time for the extra baggage and we remove individuals who are a distraction. If it's due to racism, serious family issues, major medical issues, it
@cmclymer We are all Brothers and Sisters in the military. https://t.co/cR1UglAU3u
@cmclymer That's real petty shit right there. So I don't know what other issues could cause you to be trying to make the military look bad. But we do not tolerate racism in the military. https://t.co/Tgc2OcQviL
@cmclymer because they couldn't focus on their job. I'm going to be the one who  gets shot because they weren't able to properly witch my six, bleed out leaving my child without a father. So I'm sorry if you have issue about the transgender individuals not being allowed in the military.
@cmclymer they need to get the hell out. If I can't rely on someone to do their job because they got too much going on with themselves then I'm going to be the one who pays the price. I'm going to be the one without the essential things I need. I'm going to be the one who gets blown up
@cmclymer with these kinds of major life changes. You want that kind of life we don't have time for all that extra baggage. We worried about trying to survive and rely on each other in the middle of combat operations. If people are having those kinds of issues, no matter the reason, then
@cmclymer extra bullshit that goes along with transgender changes and surgery. Again I'm there to do a job . I'm not there to deal with all of these extra social issues. I need someone that is n't going to be going through all kinds of mental and emotional issues while trying to deal
@cmclymer Now I come from a period where we had the policy, "Don't ask , don't tell." I'm not going to ask because I don't want to know keep it to yourself. We are there to do a job, You do your job and ,make sure I don't die and I'm going to do the same damn thing. I don't need all the
@cmclymer There were 208 individuals that were found to be affiliated with groups that were white supremacist groups between 2001 &amp; 2008. We had  roughly 1.550 million personnel. Racism is not tolerated in any way.	https://t.co/Vvhjr1qzxy
@cmclymer This individual has no clue as to what they are talking about. https://t.co/JSlsctkQnu
@cmclymer tolerated in the military in any way. But neither are gangs or members of gangs allowed in the military. We have an issue where cartel affiliated gangs are using the military to get their members training and  the same time they are gaining citizenship.  https://t.co/jttVlC30Ia
@cmclymer Hey, I don't know what the hell your problem is but there is no issue of racism in the Military. There is a small issue with gangs. Some of which are connected to racist groups but not many. With the size of the military a few are going to slip through but racism is not

@OutboundFacts @TeakellLarry @HoldBofaDeez @Snakeeater36 @lenlucas46 @jusantherguy So you are going to tell me you made rank all that fast got popped for pissing dirty and didn't get kicked out? Does anyone else see a problem with this?
@OutboundFacts @TeakellLarry @HoldBofaDeez @Snakeeater36 @lenlucas46 @jusantherguy He finally got out in just before 2000. I joined 2002.
@OutboundFacts @TeakellLarry @HoldBofaDeez @Snakeeater36 @lenlucas46 @jusantherguy My father went to Miami, FL in the late 80s to mid 90s. I was there with him until 1990.
@OutboundFacts @TeakellLarry @HoldBofaDeez @Snakeeater36 @lenlucas46 @jusantherguy Early 80s we lived in Clear Water,FL. Then moved to Houston and my dad traded out with a guy and we moved here to Corpus Christi, TX my place of birth. In the early 70s we were in Louisiana.
@OutboundFacts @TeakellLarry @HoldBofaDeez @Snakeeater36 @lenlucas46 @jusantherguy We lived in Puerto Rico late 70s and there were people getting busted and kicked out.

@OutboundFacts @TeakellLarry @HoldBofaDeez @Snakeeater36 @lenlucas46 @jusantherguy Yes I was I'm 48 and both of my Grandfathers served in WWII. My father served more than 20 and got out E8 and I joined at 30 to get some payback for 9/11 and turned 31 in Basic/AIT, so don't try to tell me that shit.
@OutboundFacts @TeakellLarry @HoldBofaDeez @Snakeeater36 @lenlucas46 @jusantherguy Even in war time we took em with us to Afghanistan but they were pushed out after we got back.
@OutboundFacts @TeakellLarry @HoldBofaDeez @Snakeeater36 @lenlucas46 @jusantherguy Not when you get caught smoking weed. Does anyone here know someone who wasn't kicked out of the military after pissing hot?
@OutboundFacts @TeakellLarry @HoldBofaDeez @Snakeeater36 @lenlucas46 @jusantherguy So what it sounds like to me is we have a wanna be soldier here who joined and screwed up got an other than honorable or dishonorable discharge and has no clue as to what he's talking about. Probably early 20s and has been researching stuff as he goes and screwing that up.
@OutboundFacts @TeakellLarry @HoldBofaDeez @Snakeeater36 @lenlucas46 @jusantherguy Ummmm. Tech school? That's like right after Basic? So they kicked you out  of the military right out of tech school? No wonder you don't know  shit.

@bmcmontana74 @ThePlumLineGS @YouTube @HuffPostPol However I can. I know what I'm talking about.
@bmcmontana74 @ThePlumLineGS @YouTube @HuffPostPol If you were to talk about his mishaps and how his father covered for him that's one thing. But if you bad mouth him and called him a POS I'd have to say you don't have the experience to make that claim.
@bmcmontana74 @ThePlumLineGS @YouTube @HuffPostPol I can only attack him because I am a Veteran. If you did it, I'd slam you at every turn.
@raelalt @jaketapper Nope. I'm talking to Jake and he knows I'm right. He also knows better than to debate me. Please leave me alone now unless you have a valid point here.
@bmcmontana74 @ThePlumLineGS @YouTube @HuffPostPol My father was Navy and later Coast Guard. He got out with over 20 and at E8. I was in the Army Infantry. If either of us had done anything like the things McCain got away with we'd have a federal conviction on our records. Not McCain though.

@bmcmontana74 @ThePlumLineGS @YouTube @HuffPostPol From all accounts. If McCain wouldn't have been the son of an Admiral he would have been court-martialed or pushed out of the service way before he got to Vietnam. Most people would have wound up in the BRIG and court-martialed several times over. He apparently even crashed a
@jaketapper A joke.
@jaketapper This whole thing is a sham.
@jaketapper Not working Jake.
@jaketapper No, you've never been told that if you print/report something that you would be sued. That they wouldn't make sure that you were fired for spreading false or misleading information.
@CBSEveningNews @nancycordes You had to have signed off on some paper work showing that they had closed a deal. Where is it?
@CBSEveningNews @nancycordes Ummmm.... so there is currently a deal? So they are actually in the process of building in Russia? They weren't just considering it?
@bmcmontana74 @ThePlumLineGS @YouTube @HuffPostPol Not everyone who has served is honored with the title of Veteran. In my book, McCain falls into that category.
@TaylorLorenz You know these things will try to tell your kids to kill you right?
@TaylorLorenz Eh it's MOMO.
@kieranpegler @ilangoldenberg Trump is no Oligarch/Elite. He has money but he's not a part of the organization of filthy rich in control of  the US, Canada, Australia, and the EU.
@kieranpegler @ilangoldenberg No the Elites that are running things behind the scenes. Trump is  systematically undoing everything that they need to be successful. I can  show you what I'm talking about, but I doubt you would be interested in  what I know.

@bmcmontana74 @ThePlumLineGS You aren't that important kid.
@bmcmontana74 @ThePlumLineGS Now here's something you should have realized a long time ago. I'm a well trained military veteran. I've been through shit you'll never understand and have the military bearing that goes with all of that. Do you really think anything YOU say, phases me in the slightest?
@bmcmontana74 @ThePlumLineGS Actually I should be working for the Department of Homeland Security after this for some serious money. See as a decorated combat Veteran I get all kinds of perks. As a DV I don't pay any taxes either. No home owners/land  tax. Nothing.
@bmcmontana74 @ThePlumLineGS Well it's more like, I can stand and go Gung-ho for a day but then I'm  down and out for at least two. Or I can take it slow for two to three days, then again, I'm down for 2-3 days, but ya. Once I get the surgery I'll be good to go. Dealing with the local VA is a pain.
@bmcmontana74 @ThePlumLineGS Yes I thanked you for that and reported it to Twitter. You went onto another site and took screen shot of information and brought it over here to harass me with. Thanks again.
@bmcmontana74 @ThePlumLineGS And I never once harassed him. He had already blocked me. He would have never known if you hadn't of said anything. I was just joking around. You however are harassing me.

@bmcmontana74 @ThePlumLineGS It's called copy and past. If I remember correctly, I did that on a Friday or Saturday night. Around 1 am?
@ilangoldenberg And yes we are watching these two 2 nuclear powers go at it while the Elites/Democrats play stupid FF games.
@ilangoldenberg Trump is trying to get a dictator to make changes and denuclearize.		Democrats are trying to bring in more of their voters and constituents. Foreigners.		Trying to bring about peace is always a noble effort.		Trump's lawyer is still trying to figure out a way to not go to jail.
@bmcmontana74 Too late I already reported them. Thanks.

Gaetz just told the guy exactly what to expect. Michael Cohen can't back out. This was straight up shit talking. No threat. No intimidation. Fact.
@morten @mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 @CNN I'm also quite sure that Cohen cannot get out of this event either. It's a part of his plea deal.
@morten @mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 @CNN That's not what he did. What he did was tell everyone exactly what his line of questioning is going to be about. He also just told the world that Cohen is lying cheating POS. So you have to have something in reserves to threaten him with. There's nothing left.
@morten @mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 @CNN No, his wife just learned about his girlfriends. He didn't threaten the guy. He just outed the guys secrets. Made sure he understood that it was going to get messy. Threatening and intimidation would be if he did it in secret and said if yo show up this is what's going to happen.
@morten @mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 Even CNN can't say that it was a crime. That's damn hard for them to swallow, I promise you that.		Did Cohen plead guilty to something that isn't a crime? @CNN https://t.co/mQ71THC1al
@morten @mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 Witness intimidation? He's already been convicted and has already made  signed statements on everything. This isn't about asking questions.

@oneunderscore__ I don't know Ben I think you are wrong on this one. Patton Oswalt has  called himself a pedophile and has had accusation made about him. This  one might come back to bite you in the backside. I'd chalk this one up to not aging well.

If the option presents itself, take out Nicolás Maduro if you can get backing on it.
You are going to have to make NATO and the UN look bad. You have to force them to show their hand or they will have to step up. They will step up under pressure is my guess.
Grab yourself by the nuts Sir, and step up. Get a response from NOKO at the same time.. Make sure NOKO understands who's in charge.
Tell em they also need to get Iran under control or we'll wipe Iran off the map too.
This is our back yard. We are backing off Syria. They better pay attention or we can always step up in Syria and continue with the attacks on Assad.
Thing start going in the right direction, then you send in SF and drones. There is no need for troops in this scenario. Make sure you send a back off warning to Russia.
@realDonaldTrump  I TOLD YOU TO SEND A SHOW OF FORCE TO VENEZUELA!!! Listen. Send a show of force. Don't attack. Make sure the people see you have their back. They will step up. Then send in some airdrops of weapons to support them. Push the UN and NATO. Send in CIA.

@rsqk9s There was literally nothing left of the planes. All of the planes disintegrated on impact as they were used like missiles. Most planes break up or crash in open places. That is a completely different scenario. They not only impacted like a missile might they were full of fuel.

@AJBSaysThings @AriCohn @KurtSchlichter No threat. I see something wrong, and I'm going to say something. Twitter doesn't seem to care what people like him do online. I wouldn't have seen it if I wasn't watching him attack another veteran.
@AriCohn @KurtSchlichter There are some things you just don't do. That was one of them.
@AriCohn @KurtSchlichter Actually I'm a combat Vet and no, I have a rather good opinion of Veterans. I'm trying to tell you that as a Veteran. You are not acting very smart and you are coming across in a very negative light. Where is your military bearing at? I didn't even realize you were a Veteran.
@AriCohn @KurtSchlichter It was inappropriate. That was a father yo were talking to about his son. That just isn't smart. I have no ill will but you are coming across here on the wrong side. And there is a history of things like this escalating.
@AriCohn @KurtSchlichter Excuse the typos please.
@AriCohn @KurtSchlichter That is very true. There are nut cases on social media. And if someone out of no where were to walk up to you out of no where and put a gun to your head and fire from behind you'd have no chance. https://t.co/qqwzmO5bLG
@AriCohn @KurtSchlichter You never know what is going to come from your actions on line. Be careful.
@AriCohn @KurtSchlichter That is a matter of opinion to the best of my knowledge. And yes, you said it on open Twitter @ him. I'm not going to argue this point. I know it wouldn't have been smart to try that with quite few individuals that I know. Most of which are combat veterans. Take care man.
@KurtSchlichter @AriCohn You got some real stones there. You might want to rethink what you do on open social media. I don't think saying something like that to a father about his son is real smart. He might get it in his head to do something about it. I would hope not. But you never know.
@KurtSchlichter Sorry to butt in Sir. I wanted to say something to @AriCohn.  Hey Ari Cohn. How the Fuck are you going to attack a man about his relationship with his son, and to slander his son like that in front of him in public? https://t.co/Bw2AHYsmzu

@MZHemingway @YouTube If you don't have the time to watch the entire documentary, which I suggest you do, then there is a basic breakdown of the important points  here. 		Noam Chomsky - Manufacturing Consent https://t.co/5prSH6QwmV via @YouTube
@MZHemingway @YouTube Trump in the 2016 election effectively used this void by the Republicans and took advantage of this error on their part. He, along with his supporters also mounted a successful defense against the advantage the Democrats had over information dissemination and manipulation.
@MZHemingway @YouTube the truth and information to make educated decisions on there own so much of the time. This goes entirely against what the media was suppose to be to ensure democracy in the United States.
@MZHemingway @YouTube The Democrats and those who support the Democrats had a head start on social media and using it for political means. Add to this that the majority of the MSM is owned and manipulated by it's owners puts Republicans/Conservatives/Independents in a position where they have to find

@MZHemingway @YouTube Then if you don't know about Noam Chomsky, watch 	"Noam Chomsky- Manufacturing consent (1992)" and remember this. the DNC/Elites are in control of the majority of MSM. They picked it up and ran with it. The Rep./RNC/Sponsors were behind the ball on this one.

@MattGlassman312 You've got to understand one important aspect. Once the fake Trump investigation ends, they'll no longer have influence over his decisions. Once he gets reelected for his second term, it no longer matters what the media says. The gloves will come off. I pretty much guarantee it.
@MattGlassman312 I'd watch what you say or wish for. Once Trump gets reelected, things will be much different I suspect.

@JimAdams5 I like a very broad range of music. If it sounds good...
They need to start playing short bits of "Another One Bites The Dust" at Trump rallies every time they throw out a protester.
And since he's the current President it's way more serious. The secret service is probably taking them out. I'd hate to be getting the third degree in an interrogation room some where because I was acting stupid at a Trump rally.

@DrDavidDuke protect their people that are in Israel is anti-Semitic. Now if they are doing something other than that then you need to be specific that they are doing something specifically wrong. Looking out for their people in Israel is not wrong.

@DrDavidDuke to the next. As oil becomes less of a factor I think opinions will be forced to change. But oil, money, and influence from the Middle East is a factor I believe. Until that stops, change will be slow.
@DrDavidDuke These wealthy people aren't the issue. The Jewish people aren't the issue. It's almost like the whole of Europe is still out to get them. People are still having to work to keep them from being wiped of the face of the earth. The prejudice is being passed down from one generation
@DrDavidDuke Israel sn't just another country. It's a race and a religion too, for the most part.. So it's not so much about protecting Israel as a country, it's about protecting a race/religion that has been repeatedly discriminated against. Propaganda from WWII is still causing issues.

@BerzerkerBuilds @egavactip Only problem was that real racists, or people pretending to be real racists, started getting in on the Kekistan/Pepe thing and making them all look bad. Intentionally it looked like to me. Those of 4chan had a derogatory name for them. 88ers. H is the 8th letter in the alphabet.

@BerzerkerBuilds @egavactip Those who are a part of the Kekistan thing are known trolls. They love to troll people and get them worked up when they are left wing nut cases. It was real big during the 2016 election.
I missed all of this. Something else must have been going on at the time. This is insane.

@chadlismyname @michaelmalice @biography @YouTube Like I said. There might be information somewhere in the fine details that he was hard of hearing, not deaf. However there seems to be no indication of that.
@chadlismyname @michaelmalice @biography @YouTube You still have yet to show me some kind of proof. I couldn't find it in a preliminary research and every indication says that he was not deaf so I stopped looking. I dare you to try and prove me wrong.

@Mere_pear @ElizabethEThorp I'm sorry if that hurts your feelings. But if you had an abortion, and killed an innocent child at some point after it was completely aware? You'll have to answer for that at some point I'm sure. May God have mercy on your soul. And if you don't believe? That's okay, you will.
@Mere_pear @ElizabethEThorp after the point of consciousness/awareness of self/brain activity, is murder. PERIOD. Neither you nor anyone else will be able to argue against that for much longer. Anyone who murders a sentient being in the womb should be tried for murder. This is where the line will be drawn.
@Mere_pear @ElizabethEThorp At what point does a being become sentient? At that point it is murder. I fought for your right to say stupid shit on social media but I didn't fight for you to be able to murder people because they are inconvenient. Science has caught up to this issue.

@susanendres @CDCgov So what you are spewing is completely wrong. There should only be one reason for a possible third trimester abortion. The mother's life is at serious risk. And in this age of medical science that should be very rare indeed.
@susanendres There are also many steps prior to the third trimester where they test for any abnormalities.		Diagnosis of Birth Defects | CDC https://t.co/INHvW3TY74 via @@CDCgov
@susanendres before the third trimester. This would include Anencephaly. https://t.co/u23jG5UC7T
@susanendres There is only one reason for a doctor to perform an abortion at, or just before the time of birth. The baby is already dead and the mother might die if she has a cesarean section done or tries to give birth to her still born child. Everything else should have been handled way
@susanendres Who's words are these? Where did it come from? I'm sure it's not a very  reputable source, And I really don't even care about what it says. The fact that they are pushing for a woman to be able to legally get an abortion at the time of birth is wrong.

Afghanistan is a legitimate and righteous endeavor. We need a dramatic increase in personnel there for a short period of time. We need to get the insurgents out or destroy them. Get Afghanistan away from the opium. Increase their military abilities, then plan to leave.
@isthatdouchey @ElizabethEThorp A law that allows for special reasons or cases is reasonable. But not just to be requested. That's complete BULLSHIT. And if you don't understand the difference then you're a complete moron.
@isthatdouchey @ElizabethEThorp I'm not saying that this information is reliable, however the laws are making it more likely this will become practice behind the scenes and out of sight. There is no reasonable reason for having a law that allows for a mother to request legally to have an abortion up to birth.
@isthatdouchey @ElizabethEThorp https://t.co/vYCpPDmyTM
@isthatdouchey @ElizabethEThorp And yes, stem cell research was or is being supported through abortions. And there seems to be proof of body parts and loopholes that are allowing this practice.	https://t.co/q891uXFr4p

@Will_Bill_Dias @KrugerBook him to plead guilty to something that wasn't a crime as part of the plea  deal. In exchange he got a reduced sentence. He was looking at some serious time.
@Will_Bill_Dias @KrugerBook Like I said before, if Trump had not been married it wold have been different. If Cohen had not expected to get paid back, or Trump had not paid him back, then it would also have been a campaign contribution. A BIG NOTHING BURGER. The plea deal was strictly political. They forced
@Will_Bill_Dias @KrugerBook Again it was obviously connected to the campaign. However due to the fact that he is married and that there is a dual reason for the hush money it isn't solely a campaign issue. There for it cannot be considered a campaign contribution. There is nothing illegal about the issue.
@Will_Bill_Dias @KrugerBook My Veterans are the most important however. They're my Brothers and Sisters.
@Will_Bill_Dias @KrugerBook However you's be really surprised at who follows me. Generals to lower enlisted. Special Forces of every branch to support of every kind. And I have a lot of special followers too.

@Will_Bill_Dias @KrugerBook If Trump were not married or Cohen was not expecting to get the money back, then this hack would actually have a point. Outside of that Trump made a little white lie to the American people. This too is probably because he's married.
@Will_Bill_Dias @KrugerBook it also had to do with the campaign but it cannot be considered a campaign contribution due to the fact that Trump paid him back the money that was spent.
@Will_Bill_Dias @KrugerBook Please do that. The issue with the charge that Cohen plead guilty to s that Trump is a married man. If the issue was solely a concern for the campaign then it would be a crime. However the very fact that Trump is married makes it a personal issue. Not a campaign issue. Of course

@SethAbramson concerning process crimes were made after he was appointed. He misspoke there, and was trying to say. in my opinion, that they were charged with process crimes after he was he was appointed.Process crimes were committed after the investigation was started.
@SethAbramson I've looked over this entire thread and either you're a paid hack that is trying to spread misinformation or you have some kind of grudge. Everything that I see here is twisted to fit your personal narrative. The only one mistake he has made was saying that these issues were
@SethAbramson Cohen admitted to a crime that was not a crime. He plead out to prevent getting long term sentence. We all know this. His real crimes were financial in nature. The are related to private dealings.
@SethAbramson Another process crime and a financial crime. Also the same mistake that it was a process crime after his appointment. These are all process crimes that he charged people with AFTER he was appointed. Not that they happened prior to his appointment. Looks like he misspoke to me.
@SethAbramson Another process crime, and again it's the same mistake.

@goodbklyn @MuslimIQ @Kristin_Hook irrelevant. We are talking about dangerous individuals. We are talking about drugs coming across the border in open spaces. So her argument is invalid to begin with.
@goodbklyn @MuslimIQ @Kristin_Hook Her numbers are not reliable for one. She does't have that kind of access to the Department of Homeland Security information. Much of the information that she claims to have used is not available to the general public. Also we aren't talking about numbers here. The numbers are

@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump @YouTube Over population has nothing to do with space. It's about the drain on our resources. It causes food prices/housing/medical costs to skyrocket. It will cause an increase in homelessness. It is a drain on the middle class. It causes the American tax payer to have to pay more.

It can be a two part event. One that starts out at the White House as the President and then transferred to a different location as part of your campaign.
You should have something other than just food and dinner. Rent or hire a carnival. Have a rally for the kids and their parents. You can write it off as a campaign event. https://t.co/0tIeM6WUJg

@jjmacnab Phillips walked into the middle of the group intentionally trying to intimidate them. He is an adult and he essentially was threatening them by getting in their faces. He should be charged. You can't be like that with minors.
@jjmacnab NVM See you watched it. The kids were attracted to the commotion. They were just onlookers and these two groups were arguing. They turned on the kids. The kids were just being kids. Listen to them threatening them. Listen to the racist remarks that went on for roughly an hour.

@MoPepe2 @RukhnamaLives @markdubya He wasn't the fastest. He wasn't the best. But he never gave up and he never stopped. The guy was like a machine. Kinda like the Energizer Bunny. He just kept going no matter what. Hell of a soldier in my book.

@MoPepe2 @TheDweck The kid was smiling and having fun until the old man got into his face. He broke the kid's personal boundary. You know, that arms length space that most people respect? This old man is being completely disrespectful and looking for confrontation.
@MoPepe2 @TheDweck Because he is lying. You look at the story and then watch the video. His story doesn't match what happened. I call it like I see it. He literally walked from one teen to another and got into each of their faces. He was looking for a confrontation. The kid didn't go to him.
As my followers all know, or do now. I'm always straight up and honest. I call it like I see it and don't hold anything back.

@nowthisnews The kid never moves and is just smiling and having fun until the old man gets in his face. This man is a liar and disgrace to all Native Americans and Veterans alike. Before you go there. I'm part Native American. My daughter is half Hawaiian, and I'm a decorated combat veteran.
@nowthisnews If you notice, the old man is going from teen to teen getting in their face. They are the invaders not the teens. They are not surrounding them and are not blocking them. There is no canting. They are singing along and enjoying the chant.  Watch the video a couple of times.

@TheDweck If you actually had a clue. This old man was walking from teen to teen  trying to intimidate them. The kids were sing along and enjoying themselves, standing on the stairs. Watch the video a couple of times. They walked into the middle of the group. They old man instigated it. https://t.co/oNq1yobk0C

@SpyTalker @csdickey @BillKristol Yaahh, the old man was going from teen to teen starring them down trying to intimidate them. You can see that in this video when he and his guys were entering into the middle of the group. They weren't surrounding him. Watch the kid. Then watch it again. Old man is the aggressor.
@SpyTalker @csdickey @BillKristol Ummmm, You guys do realize this was another FAKE News Story, right??? https://t.co/NW5F15Z2Sh
@SouthernKeeks Hell, I didn't even join the Army, the Infantry to be exact, until I was 30. I turned 31 in Basic/AIT. I was 33 when I was in Afghanistan. So there ain't no way you're old!!!
@SouthernKeeks 48-36=12 That means I'm 12 years your senior and there ain't no damn way I'm old.
@SouthernKeeks Shut the hell up with that nonsense. I mean seriously. If you're old, then what the hell does that make me? https://t.co/XViSFgK3CK

@guypbenson Watch the video a couple of times. They went into the middle of the kids not the other way around. The kids are standing on stairs. They aren't saying or chanting anything. They are smiling and singing along with the old man. Right up until the old man got in his face.
@guypbenson This is more fake news. The guy was getting into the faces of the kids. Not the other way around. The guy was going from teen to teen. https://t.co/QEyWxuiNcB
@guypbenson I don't believe sound on this is doctored but just look at that expression. That is a look of fear. https://t.co/GW1X2vU3Jw
@guypbenson The kids did nothing wrong. Watch the video a couple of times. They were being intimidated by the old man and the group. The kid was having fun until the old man got in his face. The old man was going from teen to teen getting in their faces. https://t.co/eKm2nfUZBY

@McKayMSmith The kid has guts in my opinion. He did nothing wrong. He stood his ground. Wasn't going to be forced to move or allow someone to intimidate him.
@McKayMSmith He was looking for one of them to stand up to him. He finally found one after he got into the kids face and broke his personal space. The kid never once moved. Watch the video a second time and watch the kid. He was having fun singing along until the old man got into his face.
@McKayMSmith This man is a liar. And before you go their. I'm part Native American. My daughter is half Hawaiian. And I'm a decorated Veteran. Just watch the video. He is going from teen to teen trying to intimidate them. They were having fun singing along and getting out of his way. https://t.co/k17oTxePdG
@yelienid9 @washingtonpost He was intentionally looking for one of them to stand up to his intrusions into their space.
@yelienid9 @washingtonpost Again, the full video shows everything that happened that was important. The kids were singing along with them. No one was acting out. They were on stairs and the old man and his crew got into the middle of them. He was going from teen to teen staring them down.
@yelienid9 @washingtonpost BULLSHIT. Prove it. Show me a video that proves it. You can't but I can show a video that proves that the student was having fun. Never once moved and didn't get into anyone's face. The old man did.
@JayDavidMurphy @LeathersSue @washingtonpost Notice the same kid earlier in the video. He was just standing there smiling and having fun. Right up until the old man broke his personal space and got into his face.That was intentional intimidation. He was looking for one of them to stand up to him.
@JayDavidMurphy @LeathersSue @washingtonpost He found the kid he was looking for. The one who wouldn't be afraid to stand up to him.
@JayDavidMurphy @LeathersSue @washingtonpost This guy is a liar. There was no chanting as seen in the video of, "Build that Wall." There was no one blocking him. They were moving out of his way. He entered into the group from the outside. The old man was going from teen to teen staring them down. https://t.co/LJWvS7SCDK

@RukhnamaLives @markdubya He was intentionally intimidating them from one kid to the next. Every one of them looked away or acted afraid. He moved on to the next until he found the last one who stood his ground. This was intentional. https://t.co/XwaqU7FI9P
@RukhnamaLives @markdubya Again, I redirect to the video I posted, The kids are on stairs just standing there. The old Veteran/Native American and his crew walk into the middle of them. He walks from kid to kid. Gets in each of their faces until he gets into the last kids face. He was not leaving. https://t.co/qZKMoL2rTw
