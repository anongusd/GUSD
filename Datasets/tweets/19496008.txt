@jordan_maprad The statistics and data are ALL relevant. Opinions about same are not equally so.
@jordan_maprad Not a bit. It means I don't care to defend it TO YOU.
@jordan_maprad You said "the data, like most data, is highly debated and varies widely..." -- I want to know what relevant data is debated.
@jordan_maprad Because YOU said "all people have something to fear when walking down the sidewalk" -- which dismisses a key difference.
@jordan_maprad Which group did I devalue?
@jordan_maprad I don't follow your logic, but I suspect there is much about which we disagree, on a very basic level. Move along.
@jordan_maprad It "incorporates" the western world -- it isn't defined by it. Still, my initial position is defensible in the western world.
@jordan_maprad (e) Who seriously challenges the widely held belief that, outside of prison, women are more likely to be victims of rape?
@jordan_maprad (d) As previously noted, probabilities (e.g. your "1%" stat) are not necessarily related to fear.
@jordan_maprad (c) I didn't go looking for you or your opinion. You brought yours to my timeline. If you disagree, step away.
@jordan_maprad (b) Whether women get raped by someone they know or a stranger is irrelevant to my point &amp; has nothing to do with the horror.
@jordan_maprad (a) I never said "western world" -- if you want to discuss that, start a discussion somewhere else. Count me out.
@jordan_maprad Are you familiar with data on sexual assault, and how differently that crime involves men and women?
@jordan_maprad What do YOU think is most women's greatest fear when they are alone on a sidewalk after dark?
@jordan_maprad FYI: you spend an inordinate amount of time attempting to rephrase or interpret something most people didn't need translated.
@jordan_maprad Are you familiar with the phrase "pearls before swine"...?
Oops. My bad. I thought you challenged me to an HEIR guitar duel. So I restrung my infant son and have been strumming the hell out of him.
@jordan_maprad Thousands of women (and some men) got my point. You didn't. I think you and I will both survive this missed connection.
@jordan_maprad I may be missing your point. I don't think most men fear rape, most places outside of prison. Most women do. That's my point.
@jessiewatmore Thank you. The extent to which my tweet resonated with women is simultaneously gratifying and discouraging. I wish for hope.

@jordan_maprad No. That wasn't the comparison. It was about "greatest fear." There was no comparison made about levels of danger. Read much?
@jordan_maprad Are you saying that women don't fear rape? I know a few who say otherwise. Very few feel truly safe, because... misogyny.

If you have a problem with her breastfeeding in public, I have a problem with your breathing in public. 		I think they call this an impasse.
You can't spell "exhausted" without your "ex"...
Obit references hangover. Wow. | RT @DJBentley This is without doubt the best obituary you will ever read http://t.co/B4LIBswi ...
@LocalChicGeek you go, girl!
Civilization requires things like mint juleps on a hot summer's day and treating one another graciously.
New rule: If you're gonna drink a lot of beer and sit in my row at a concert, you've got to bring a catheter or learn to pee internally.
The drummer for @Coldplay is a stone-cold killer. So says the drum kit. Damn.
Dude, she's not that into you. 		And I'm not that into your badass Affliction t-shirt.		I think your third strike is just around the corner.
Nothing says "I don't give a fuck" quite like a velour tracksuit. 		At a wedding. 		On a dude.
I've got 99 problems, and this itch on my ankle is one.
@Brian_J_Hall u at the show?
Look around you. 		Imagine that every IQ point you see is a dollar. 		Do y'all have enough to buy dinner?		A cocktail?		Maybe busfare home?
There's a reason they're called "Daisy Dukes" and not "Boss Hoggs." 		Keep that in mind.
If you've never TRIED pickled okra, don't even TALK about pickled okra. 		That's all I'm gonna say on that particular topic at this time.
@earljw @robynkonichiwa I was just thinking that. "Fire station thoughts" is what I call them.
Works for me: @robynkonichiwa opening for @Coldplay in Tampa. Now.

Her memory is longer than her skirt. 		And she doesn't remember what she had for lunch.

I'd swear that some girls can't walk in heels when they're sober. But, by the end of the night...
RT @Yimsterfife: Twitter is what life would be like if it was always 4 AM and you lived in a Denny's.
I live a charmed life -- by which I mean I am dangling from a chain, and, as I look around, I see a bunch of other things dangling near me.
RT @prodigalsam: just realized horses can’t hug and now I can’t sleep

We're not laughing WITH you. 		We're laughing AT you. 		#ProTip: YOU should probably laugh with us.
So evidently Facebook changed everybody's email address. So what? It's not as though they are taking over our twiFACEBOOK IS AWESOME.
RT @chopper4jk: Some of the best moments in life are the ones you can’t tell anyone about.
That feeling you get when you inhale a spoonful of yogurt that ain't quite right? 		I just watched someone have that feeling.

If this is your family's annual vacation week, and y'all picked Florida for it... do NOT ride out this storm in one of our casinos.
I've lived through a tornado and multiple hurricanes and floods. Now Debby. Ain't no sunshine til she's gone...
Be the change you wish to see in your tip jar on the counter by the cash register.
Exactly. | RT @MissDestructo This is definitely #thestormthatatetampa

High marks all 'round for sportsmanship. Minimal diving. Mutual respect. Grace under pressure. #EUR02012
England deserve this win in much the same way that @rickygervais deserves the Papacy. #EUR02012
RT @TheGoonerholic: Never has a mass rendition of "You couldn't score in a brothel" been more apt.
It's not fair. England obviously have Dumbledore tending the net. #EUR02012
Preachers should impact politics in much the same way that squirrels impact stock markets.
@CrissieC Still, it coulda been bravery. Was anybody shooting at him at the time? Or were the burgers on fire?
@FilthyRichmond From which end of the cat did said hit emanate? Because, well...
Y'all should totally check out @libbiesummers -- I know her, and she is a bacon goddess. #NSFV (not safe for vegetarians)
My wife was a model for those hairstyle magazines you see in salons, so there's a chance some of y'all actually asked to look like her once.
Whoa! Sometimes, when I meet people for the first time, it's almost as if I have a fifth sense...
@agirlwithneeds I'm not sure about the technically correct answer --but EVENTUALLY it's "Daddy playing with baby so Mommy gets to sleep in."
My wife says I'm trying to force our daughter to be left-handed. 		I say, "Quit taking that duct tape off of her right hand!"
RT @stupendu: There's a stick figure family on the car ahead of me and it's obvious the mom has had some work done.
If superpowers were distributed reasonably, those of us who Are Always Right would also have the power to Not Be Condescending. [ sigh ]
My daughter vibrates with excitement when she knows she's about to be liberated from her crib to join the day. Here's to nurturing THAT.
RT @DanteEvilCat: That awkward moment when someone says "stop", and you don't know whether to respond with "collaborate and listen" or " ...
Some of the people up in here do nothing but tweet about booze and boobs. It's as if they never even heard of bacon. Good grief!
We've had so much rain that the dog has taught herself how to pee internally -- not "inside"... INTERNALLY. She's recycling. Hates the rain.
Why is it that the "Lost &amp; Found' office is so damned hard to find? That's management's idea of a joke, right?
RT @nerdamage: I watched a youtube video of how to make a youtube video.
@Acoyle33 ...but that ain't as awful as telling the ticket agent at the airport "You too!" after s/he says "Have a great flight." [sigh]
@rickygervais Overwhelming. And so it is.
@TweetinTams ...or Excedrin. Just remember to hydrate.
@Dennymayo Yeah. That was awesome. Flat-out awesome.
@lolojones CONGRATS!
@melissahweiner true dat

Politics in the sunshine state could make Huey P. Long blush. (Do you have any idea how hard it is to make a dead crook blush?)
@BIF A universe of one, of course. The findings are conclusive.
I'm a badass. I had @Oreo cookies for breakfast. Like I said: I'm a badass.
@TweetinTams :-)
If you're trying to learn the difference between expensive crystal and fake crystal, learn from a baby. A baby won't touch the cheap shit.
It's really precious when babies first start to play with their food. 		Unless you're a breastfeeding mom.		And baby has teeth.
We used to have a lot of pretty things on the bottom shelves and low tables in our home. Now the prettiest thing of all crawls on our floor.
RT @Raistlend: Have you guys noticed it's getting blurry earlier?
@tyronem "There’s got to be a reason, 	and we know the reason why and act real cool..."
So I have some sort of abdominal strain, and I won't be diving in the Olympics this summer. No real connection between those two facts.
I say "irregardless" for the same reason you take extra long to back out of a parking space when there's somebody waiting to pull in.
Irregardless of what you may or may not have read or heard, I will absolutely not be participating in a reunion of 80s megasupergroup Cameo.
@fwimmer You are a consultant's consultant.
I don't care what your mission statement says. If your fear of failure exceeds your lust for success... you are committed to mediocrity.
It is pretty dumb to tweet while driving		a stolen car.
It would be kinda cool if mood swings were like a combination of hammocks and mood rings. But they're not.
@Slinkybrowneyes Indeed. I think people ought only complain about the weather when it starts to truly rain men. Imagine the puddle problem.
@cravenheart of course

@shermandorn Yessir! They've got dishes of accents on the bar the way places here have pretzels &amp; peanuts. It's crazy out yonder, I tell ya!
@Faux_Ma PROTIP: don't use the "High Occupancy Vehicle" carpool lane, if the hostages are what allow you to qualify as "high occupancy"...
@FalconsTron Exactly.
@shermandorn You ever been to a bar in Austin? Just sayin'...
@GenXMedia :-)
@TheLastGoddess Holy crap!!! They divorced?!? I thought it was just an open relationship. Oh, wow. I didn't see this one coming. So sad.
This here is a shout-out to everyone who knows the lyrics to "Ice, Ice Baby" -- y'all know who you are.
I would like to write a novel based on my vacation adventures at the beach. I would like to call it "Tequila Mockingbird."
