@satchmouth We do in fact consider the campaign coverage political journalism
@JonCoppage I said actually funny! I mean avoid the point score obvious jokes or spending a lot of time thinking about them
General advice for anyone entering political journalism is: 1. twitter should be additive/side stuff, not the bulk of time spent; 2. Avoid popular fights/pile ons unless it’s something you fundamentally care about, 3. Only tell jokes you actually think are funny, avoid formulas
Do think twitter has significantly shifted from the flatter terrain when I was like 20 to the current situation, in which it’s much harder to break into more professional conversations via twitter.
Agree with @AsteadWesley that twitter remains really useful for people without established networks. Would also add that if the people advocating logging off, etc., don’t work in the kinds of places that promote good work well, checking out can have practical effects for anyone.

@poniewozik Yes, and I keep seeing it interpreted as a good polling sign for, like, Joe Biden, sometimes alongside polling that says Democrats are essentially less ideologically lefty than sometimes people think, which might marry up... or it might not!
@LPDonovan I feel like if the primary were somehow unrealistically set up like the 2018 House map was, Klobuchar would be in an incredibly strong position. (Which she might be here, who knows, I try to avoid too strong of predictions now.)
One sword that cuts both ways is the polling response that people would prefer someone who can beat Trump to someone who shares all their views — that could mean like Biden or Klobuchar, but it could also mean someone really lefty, depending on whose views we're talking about...?

Now that Warren’s already using “9 to 5” so I’m not in danger of putting it in someone’s head so they can overuse the song, I can share this take, which is idk why more campaigns don’t use it — the lyrics are very populist and it’s fun to listen to (vs. a sad populist folk song)

...aside from that, we rarely published politics stories about Trump until the day he actually announced, at which point @KFILE began publishing the bulk of our (largely critical) Trump campaign coverage. Obviously in 2016, we covered him much more broadly, but that's natural imo
Aside: Hadn't read the Lepore piece on the future of journalism until subway ride; this is incorrect to say we were "obsessed." We published @mckaycoppins's great feature on Trump in 2014 (which we'll never hear the end of it about, of course), but... https://t.co/jZPWiWvCa1

Elections often are reactions to the previous ones, but rarely have the *exact* same paradigm, and I think people still thinking about about politics through prism of what they think was denied Hillary/Bernie or the choices before Trumpism are likely to be frustrated by 2020.

@baseballcrank @_Drew_McCoy_ It's definitely a different electorate — and the actual biggest difference to me between then and now is that media environment/accessibility can deaden effectiveness of vaguer messages.

@McWordinson It isn't about Beto as the new Carter, and is not at all what I am proposing.

@michcusejoe5 Well, check out the piece... the Carter years were literally some of the worst, but he did successfully come out of nowhere to win that nomination then the election (the campaign is regarded as successful). Beto isn't compared favorably to that in this piece, also.

@rumpfshaker This was a little constrained by length here but I mean more like all Gillibrand’s signature issues (e.g. military sexual assault prosecution, MeToo) are pretty gender centric, as has been her political process stuff w the PAC
Sometimes, it is sort of amazing how life just rolls on, knowing that meanwhile, the president is in the White House firing off a tweet a la your neighbor just taking a stroll outside naked
RT @mollypriddy: i can always tell he’s tweeted when everyone on here has out their decoder rings
RT @Olivianuzzi: A lot to unpack in this one.

@SethAMandel FWIW, pretty obvious place to look, not all things are oppo!
@M_G_Stone I don’t really think it’s a slight to say Kirsten Gillibrand is focused on gender one month from a year often called “the year of the woman”
@M_G_Stone Story gets into this briefly, but Gillibrand’s political brand emphasizes women (everything from policy, w military sexual assault in particular, to politics, w MeToo in particular, to process, her PAC is geared toward women seeking office)
