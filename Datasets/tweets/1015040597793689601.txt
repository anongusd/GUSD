@kellyjane821 @HillaryClinton @McFaul @kellyjane Thank you so much...@kellyjane
@kellyjane821 @HillaryClinton @McFaul I don't care about what people think about me my dear...but you just did something very wrong because i saw in bible:" Never judge others right?" But you're doing and in the wrong way without evidences...😀
@thewatchfulmom @HillaryClinton @McFaul Nobody is perfect my dear @thewatchfulmom

@kellyjane821 @HillaryClinton @McFaul You're totally wrong...anyway thank you for your time..i appreciate
@omeretta4l You're a Star 🌟..i can tell u right now...you got it..WORLDWIDE SUPER STAR COMING SOON..
@kellyjane821 @HillaryClinton @McFaul I can see how weak is your mindset my dear...in fact God created the world in 6 days ...correct...but the next day was part of his work to creat the link between all creations (maybe you don't know that...) I just summarize
@thewatchfulmom @HillaryClinton @McFaul You know what? I think that your mindset is corrupted by the energies coming from the wrong comments about Hillary...so take your time to learn more about her
@kellyjane821 @HillaryClinton @McFaul Never mind... I'm who i am...i respect everybody...but I'm responsible of what i say but I'm not responsible of what you understand...anyway:" i can explain it to you but i can't UNDERSTAND FOR YOU...
@kellyjane821 @HillaryClinton @McFaul Yeah 8followers ..but let me tell you something..God is strong, powerful, wonderful than everything right??? But he spent 7days to make this world happen...and the sun never ever rise straight he rise step by step and shine more and more... That's it

People who are not with Hillary Clinton let me tell you something:" please don't accept my friendship because we are not living on the same dimension of life...okay???
@MslillieMaga @HillaryClinton @McFaul My mom used to tell me that:" when your light is pure don't expect everyone to appreciate you... That's it!!" Hillary Clinton is the best hope for our future in the world..
