After the civil contempt jailing, the prosecutor had Al-Arian indicted for criminal contempt. The judge then sat on the case for years, for reasons she's never explained publicly. Eventually the feds dropped the case and Al-Arian was deported https://t.co/uOjdH5nl0Q
One other connection of note: the prosecutor in Al-Arian case and the one now assigned to Manning's is the same guy. https://t.co/ujCwb0Ckb1
That case a bit different than Manning's in that Al-Arian's attorneys did not support our effort to open it up. I suspect Manning's team will favor public access.
We had to go to 4th Circuit to get access to proceedings where a man was sent to prison for many months. By time 4th Circuit ruled, issue was largely moot, but they told the district court judge in essence that some records of the fight needed to be released.

Trump's attorneys were trying to deflate or drain the drama out of the moment we'll see today with Cohen waving a check with Trump's signature.
It's notable that the only thing WH/Trump team really changed their narrative on was Trump's knowledge of and details of the payments re Stormy etc. And that's where Cohen has receipts.

@MattNegrin Important to preserve a paper copy for the lawyers though. Don't need some pesky prosecutor saying you were trying to destroy evidence.

@EricColumbus @charlie_savage And at least one court, wrongly in my view, has upheld that in the #FOIA context. But where a prosecutor wants the info out, the situation could be quite different. And the rules for Congress, well, there really aren't any.
@EricColumbus Also worth noting that while a lot of 302s have come out on Clinton emails, Gore, etc., DOJ has gone to great lengths to prevent @charlie_savage and myself from getting 302s in prosecutor-driven investigations like CIA torture probe.  https://t.co/ryNZkorWVA

@kellydraper @msalgado I think it's a poor use of news network airtime to carry wall-to-wall remarks of a primary candidate with a reputation for saying outrageous and false things to see which things he'll say.
@kellydraper @msalgado I don't speak for POLITICO and certainly not for other outlets. I think Jeff Zucker acknowledged they covered too much Trump wall-to-wall during the campaign. But if you think either less coverage or more aggressive coverage of him by MSM would've dented his appeal, I disagree
@KlasfeldReports I think they do both really. CNN shouldn't have wall-to-walled so many Trump rallies, but in an internet era he would've been a thing anyway. And he thrives on efforts to contain him. And his supporters view them as indication of his strength.

Another is that reporters weren't the only ones shooed away from the closed-door oral arguments at the D.C. Circuit on this last month. The firm's own lawyers were excluded while prosecutors made their case to the judges. Very unusual.
One is that prosecutors (apparently Mueller ones) asked Chief Judge Howell to fine the company $10,000 a day for defying the subpoena. She decided $50,000 was more appropriate.

@joshtpm Also someday Trump will depart the scene and at that point if we wield the Trump yardstick to judge everything, the world is going to look very strange. So, I'm reluctant to adopt the notion that treason is the only thing to be concerned about.
@joshtpm Did media and some commentators take the possibility of criminal charges too seriously? Yes. (All? No. https://t.co/9ySjfRrRec) Did Trump brilliantly exploit that? Yes. Does it follow from that that it's trivial to evade accountability &amp; transparency? No. And that's my point.
@joshtpm I get the point. And I think it's valid, with the caveat that we don't have a complete picture of who at FBI was stepping on the gas on Trump probe and who was giving NYT the wave-off. OTOH, it was never plausible that there be no inquiry into HRC's odd email practices.
@maddezmom Both things are troubling. One's obviously far more grave if true. We don't want our elected officials to be beholden to foreign governments. But we also can't have our public officials conducting all their business off the books. Seems possible to hold both ideas in mind at once

@steve_vladeck Seems to me that's ambiguous in the DC Circuit opinion, right? Most such penalties seem to be linear. Would be great to see the District Court order
Mueller folks could even go back and ask judge for tougher sanctions. I've heard of geometrically-increasing contempt penalties. As the @just_security piece notes, though, it's not entirely clear whether the penalty can be collected. So, it could wind up being symbolic.
One thing I'd add to: DC Circuit opinion says judge imposed escalating sanctions on the mystery foreign corp ('to increase each day'). Some punditry has said the state-owned company could absorb it, but an escalating fine could be a problem/messy even for a rich firm/country https://t.co/y9SQaQEEaA

@djsziff @AndyGrewal This also came up at the Edwards trial. Lowell argued it was an absurd Catch-22: if you used campaign money to pay off a mistress, you'd be charged--at least at the FEC--with diverting campaign funds for personal purposes. My memory is prosecutors said not their problem.
@AndyGrewal @EricColumbus @rickhasen @pbump It could've been campaign-related at least in part by both men but proof of Trump's knowledge of the legal requirements could be lacking. There are also mixed-motive issues here as in Edwards. Timing speaks for itself, but Trump has made payments like this before.

@BillyBarbel @jordanhklein @LizSaxen @kyledcheney John Edwards was accused of knowing about around $1 million in payments to his pregnant mistress amidst the 2008 presidential campaign. He said he didn't know. Defense argued even if he did, they were not campaign donations. Hung jury.
For all the talk that prosecutors are mad at Downing, this passage makes it sound like Manafort's lawyers were trying to help him give Mueller what he wanted. https://t.co/F728ClKnZG
@BillyBarbel @jordanhklein @LizSaxen @kyledcheney That starts to look like a corporate contribution. But Trump team will and has argued Trump did this all the time and what he did during the campaign was no different. That would seem to undercut the required knowledge it was illegal, even if it was...
@BillyBarbel @jordanhklein @LizSaxen @kyledcheney It's not. He has to know it was illegal either to pay it or not to report it. Also Edwards' lawyer now Kushner's lawyer argued this kind of payment wasn't reportable. Involvement of the Enquirer complicates comparison to Edwards a bit.
What Eric said. (He's a lawyer.) I'd go so far as to say SDNY team is dancing around this point deliberately. It's another required element of the crime and they're not saying if they think they can prove it or not. Of course, POTUS unlikely to be charged anyway under DOJ policy https://t.co/1dgXUu686Z
@Mimirocah1 @EricColumbus @RGA702 @neal_katyal Nope. Candidates don't make filings. Campaign treasurers do. Also came up at Edwards trial.
I covered the John Edwards trial and the prosecutors had to introduce evidence that campaign finance law requirements were discussed with him.
Yes, while ignorance is not usually a defense, to convict someone of a campaign finance law violation you must show that they knew the conduct was illegal. It's a requirement that applies in various areas of law considered complex. https://t.co/5Zwv10CVBt

@lushdragon the underlying request is arguably part of the deliberative process and can then be withheld.
@lushdragon I think, based on past experiences, the vagueness is aimed at avoiding express adoption. If the signer says 'I'm doing this for the reasons attached' or even 'as you requested,' the underlying records become the official reason and releasable. But if you just say 'waived'..
RT @tylerpager: Big crowds at Central Park to see the Mandarin duck (cc @juliarebeccaj) https://t.co/eDsjZlK9ox
The reason this waiver is so short is because DOJ has structured this process to be opaque so the request is withheld while the 'decision' is released.

Former FBI Director James Comey warned years ago that government would regret allowing Petraeus to plead to a misdemeanor. He predicted accurately it would be thrown in government's face in every subsequent classified info mishandling case.
So muted Petraeus effect in this case, where guidelines called for 0-6 months. Prosecutor Danya Atiyeh, who recently handled Albury case, said the facts in each case differ and she denied any 'political considerations' affecting the government's approach.
Defense lawyer Cary Citronberg told reporters after the hearing: 'He had no nefarious purposely' Citronberg said he was 'disappointed the judge gave [Regis] a harsher sentence than...Gen. Petraeus.'

@emptywheel @RDEliason @jedshug @Mimirocah1 @danielsgoldman @Delavegalaw @CBHessick @nycsouthpaw @AshaRangappa_ @BarbMcQuade @JoyceWhiteVance @EricColumbus He's their marquee case. What matters isn't what's going on but what Trump thinks is going on.
@emptywheel @RDEliason @jedshug @Mimirocah1 @danielsgoldman @Delavegalaw @CBHessick @nycsouthpaw @AshaRangappa_ @BarbMcQuade @JoyceWhiteVance @EricColumbus You're all overthinking the pardon. In the absence of reports that Manafort's implicated Trump or his family, Trump will do the pardon not as a 4-dimensional chess move, or even checkers, but because it will make him feel good. And we just got another anti-Mueller tweet.
@yesthatabbywood Within the last hour
BREAKING: Chief Justice Roberts just indefinitely stayed the District court's order in this case......#SCOTUS https://t.co/VUubKLSvNN
Can you really add up the values of Manafort's real estate this way? What about the mortgages? Are they suggesting he (or family members) own these free and clear? https://t.co/6uLFaBQ7nR
@HelleMax One of his daughters was living in the Edgewood house and I believe is listed as the official owner.
@HelleMax Seems like the Alexandria condo and the Palm Beach house have survived the legal storm. And many of the other properties the feds are seizing have mortgages on them so not sure precisely how much equity in each. Some could have been drawn down to pay legal bills too.

Coming up on @11thHour @msnbc to talk Manafort plea, Kavanaugh allegations and Trump tweets....
@emptywheel Maybe this is the "aspens" poem of this case. "We are with you! [Paul! Paul!]"
NEW: Manafort agreed to give up the Trump Tower apartment in order to avoid seizure of a Charles Schwab securities account. Baxter St apt will also sub, for Edgewood house in Arlington...per Mueller spokesman
AND SCENE: Manafort's guilty plea was formally entered by the court. Hearing is over. "I plead guilty," Manafort said. Details here w/@dsamuelsohn : https://t.co/weJhobHOQA
Sentencing guidelines are 210-262 months, probably, judge says. But statutory max is 10 years in DC case, so guidelines are basically irrelevant
Special for @emptywheel: Weissmann said Manafort has admitted to all of the bank fraud charges brought in VA federal court. Those federal charges will go away under the deal, but some could be resurrected by states.
MORE: Judge says Manafort is agreeing to "cooperate fully and truthfully" with the investigation https://t.co/OverEIu1PN
Judge is telling Manafort that he could be sentenced consecutively to any sentence in VA. He says he understands
Weissmann just said Manafort has agreed to forfeit his Trump Tower apartment and another on Baxter Street in NY. That provision is not in the paperwork filed publicly this morning.
One person gets a pass from Weissmann this morning: Melissa Laurenza, Manafort's FARA lawyer. Weissmann stresses she was "unwitting" of the falsehoods she relayed to DOJ.
Weissmann has been beating up Skadden, says firm told Manafort there was virtually no evidence of Tymoshekno's criminal intent, also says firm did undisclosed work for Ukrainian government including training/advising Ukrainian justice officials
@emptywheel Can you explain how a false statement to DOJ would be prosecuted in state court?
Note: Giuliani suggested to POLITICO earlier this week that Trump might be OK with cooperation because they don't believe Manafort has any damaging testimony to offer on Trump https://t.co/YdZ65SVZAl
SIREN: Manafort plea deal calls for "successful cooperation" with government--prosecutor https://t.co/KCMBWeZk0I
Manafort said softly "I do" and "I understand" as the judge listed the rights Manafort is giving up.
The deadlocked counts will be dismissed. There's no chance Manafort will be released today because there is no request to change his bond status, Westling says.
Manafort plea hearing is underway. He's at the lectern with Westling, not Downing. Westling said Manafort wants to plead guilty. Judge is beginning the plea colloquy now. Judge says remaining counts in VA will be dismissed.
Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort has struck a plea deal with prosecutors that calls for him to serve no more than 10 years in prison, a source says. But will he serve any time, or score a Trump pardon. @dsamuelsohn &amp; I report https://t.co/weJhobHOQA

@emptywheel @bmaz @jedshug I'm there a couple times a week. You know there is a high-profile grand jury meeting there? So this is a side trip.
@emptywheel @bmaz @jedshug right but access through pacer depends not on the date of the event but the date the transcript was filed. These were filed last month so won't be cheap until November.
I have to say handling it this way reminds me a bit of Alan Simpson's vague Nightline hit on Anita Hill, which wasn't right. But it had leaked, so what to do? https://t.co/4DeEe9333m

@emptywheel @bmaz @jedshug Yes. I didn't buy them but they were unsealed a few weeks ago. It's during the back and forth about bail issues. Jackson said she's done some things to address defense concerns about paying legal fees. And I think there was passing discussion of the forfeiture cases.
@MiriamElder I thought Putin hated gays
@BregmanPs I was being semi-sarcastic. But I do feel the counting adds an aura of science to something that's an art.
@bmaz @emptywheel @jedshug we know there were separate legal actions to seize/freeze some of his accounts...how precisely they're linked I'm not clear since that info still under seal..but it seems like a move to freeze assets allegedly subject to forfeiture in the DC criminal case https://t.co/I4qzIBoOTe
Hot take: Factchecking that tallies up all of Trump's falsehoods plays right into his hands by minimizing the most significant ones.
The fact that this info is unprivileged from the government side in any legal sense is evident by the fact that the National Archives &amp; FOIA routinely release records about 'off-the-record' interaction w/press, including Kavanaugh's https://t.co/RYPWdTR08H https://t.co/NweuYZUBG3
@emptywheel @jedshug @bmaz 1 of those few experts just emailed: The Laura, 114 US 411, 414 (1885)(“the president, under the general, unqualified grant of power to pardon offenses against the United States, may remit fines, penalties, and forfeitures of every description arising under the laws of congress”)
@emptywheel @jedshug @bmaz Hey Obama had good lawyers and didn't do the advance commutation for Cartwright that he arguably shoulda done instead of a pardon. Very few experts in the nuances of clemency.
@jedshug @bmaz @emptywheel typo there
RT @brithume: C’mon Twitter. This is just silly. The phrase is written into law. https://t.co/7kstGlN5Vd
@bmaz @jedshug @emptywheel Well it wouldn't leave her completely exposed if he pardoned her, would it? Pardons for everyone! Maybe partially exposed
@bmaz @jedshug @emptywheel I think @bmaz is right on this. If Congress can compel testimony, why can't courts? Trick would be proving that another prosecution was unaffected, through North/Kastigar precedent. No? https://t.co/4ijiw9BDlb
I think it's possible the feds could compel Manafort's testimony over his objection once fed prosecution is foreclosed or given up on. What happens in state court to ensure an ensuing prosecution is free of tainted info would be for state court to address. https://t.co/9poEcxEWj4

IS THAT YOU, GOD? Torrential rain just turned to lightning and thunder outside Manafort trial https://t.co/jB4AeaIvnc https://t.co/gLS89Rfqt4
Also got a link here to the 48-year-old case the 78-year-old judge used to urge the jury to reach unanimity. Sort of an Allen charge. But a Sawyers charge.
Latest from Manafort trial: Jury struggles with one count, or maybe more? Defense suggests a 'hung' jury box on verdict form Judge passes, for now. W/@dsamuelsohn https://t.co/6p26RJG6HH
Manafort jury just entered 4th day of deliberation. 2nd day not looking much at defendant. He seemed chipper. Several Manafort lawyers now meeting him in holding cell on ground floor.
Manafort lawyer Kevin Downing says Manafort 'happy to heart' jury will deliberate another day. Also said it was a 'very good day.' Asked if the continuing deliberations were a good sign for Manafort, Downing said: 'We believe so.'
BREAKING: No verdict returned on day 3 of Manafort deliberations. A sheaf of paper handed in by jury just after 6PM. Was it a verdict form? No. Just menus for lunch tomorrow. Earlier: https://t.co/PAwqsTU8g1

@DeepStateVoter @minedyingbride @PoliticallyAlt My view isn't based solely on the reasonable doubt question but also the one that seems to reject outright two of the three grounds prosecution advanced for the unreported foreign bank account charges
I say 'could be' because there was some evidence that he had signature authority over some accounts, although defense argued someone forged his signature. But seems indisputable he had authority to cause disbursements for his own benefit on demand. Many emails showing that (2/2)
It seems clear that Manafort had what qualified as signature authority over many overseas accounts since this definition goes beyond literal signature authority. But to be guilty it could be that Manafort must've known about the expansive definition (1/2) https://t.co/x1WQv1OeEX

@AndrewCMcCarthy George protested RTC's pick of Jay Stephens to investigate Whitewater. OIC looked into whether that amounted to obstruction. Ended up letting it go, to coin a phrase.
@AndrewCMcCarthy That said, I agree with you that 'let it go,' without more, is not what obstruction cases are typically made of. Strangely, most parallel DC case on this point actually involved Rudy's interlocutor this morning: Stephanopoulos.
@AndrewCMcCarthy I understand. Trump's position is that the conversation never happened and, if it did, Comey's account is exculpatory. Comey is an entirely incredible liar, but much of his testimony is helpful to Trump.
The precise quote from Giuliani: "What he said to him was: 'Can you give a man a break?'" If Giuliani meant to be paraphrasing Comey, should have said so. Rudy didn't just fall off the turnip truck.
It appeared to me Giuliani was saying Trump did say it, but your interpretation is a possible one. If Rudy was doing what you say, I'd urge him to note his client claims the exchange did not happen. https://t.co/nnmdRbUJhh
Chris Christie predicts on @ThisWeekABC that Mueller will not produce any public report until after the election. Time is simply too short before the pre-election window where DOJ typically goes silent. (Set aside the lack of a legal mechanism for a report.)
