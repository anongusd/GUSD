For everyone saying like @realDonaldTrump that the wall was a campaign promise and that the American people wanted it despite the popular vote, bear in mind that decision is annulled by the 2018 midterms where we as a country overwhelmingly said no we don’t want you stupid wall.
@DNC manage to flip more than 40 seats in Congress while the @GOP only managed to flip less than 10? And it would take to much time and research to get the numbers for state races that they managed to flip but it’s safe to say it was a lot.
was because many republicans did not support it then and still many don’t support it now and if the citizenry supported it then why did @HouseGOP lose 40+ seats and the @SenateGOP only netted a 2 seat gain despite a huge advantage in number of seats being wagered? And why did the
support to build a wall in the states directly affected or impacted by the border let alone the entire country as a whole, and if there were then it would have been done when republicans controlled all branches of the Congress and the Presidency but they could not pass it then
would make that block 67-34 D-R making a total of 74-39 D-R (75-38 D-R including Hurd and assuming all remaining republicans remain united for the wall) an even larger and more unlikely margin to make up. The point is federally and executively (on the state level) there is no
touching the border, has already come out against the wall so that means that if all of the remaining 7 republicans supported it, they have to flip 6/27 votes to their side. Now I know some may say wait, it’s not fair why doesn’t every U.S. Representative get a vor then fine that
small strip of the district that does). That would give you a total of 17-8 D-R voting on the commission and its highly unlikely that there would be 5 democrats that would vote with those 8 republicans and on republican, Hurd of TX whose is the only republican district actually

population. That’s means that 0.18% of the nation has an equal say in the selection of cabinet nominees and federal judicial nominees as every other state in the country. We either need to radically reshape our government structure or we need to change how it functions because
some sense as the least populated still had a significant portion of population and there was a huge disparity. In the 2010 census the most populated state accounts for only 12% of the total population while the least populated state only accounted for 0.18% of the total
When the country was formed and the constitution was written, according to the 1790 census, the least populated state accounted for just over 1.5% of the total population and the most populated accounted for almost 20% or 1/5 of the total population. So 2 senators per state made

that there is something wrong with you otherwise they would not used the word. Words of hate should be eradicated from our language and stop demonizing those who have climbed out of the bondage of hate.
Context does matter but a slur is a slur for a reason, because it’s inherently derogatory and signifies that you don’t want to be that word, so when anyone uses it they are saying there is something wrong with you and seal it with that word to hurt you and make you understand
A slur is a slur no matter how it’s being used or who uses it, this malicious intent garbage is just that. You never know what’s truly in someone’s heart and claiming to so that you can excuse someone’s behavior is hypocritical at best.

of internship. And something that maybe needs to be pointed out to people is that just because the government provides funding to pay interns, that’s not “free” money. That’s our tax money being spent and maybe not very responsibly.
I’m not 100% convinced they should but at the same time it should not cost them to intern either. Maybe we should think about intern dorms as opposed to them needing their own apartments and a small stipend for food. They don’t necessarily need a full salary plus the benefits
Look, I’ll be honest I’m a little mixed on this.

If you stretch it out another 325 years, a total of 650, it would be just over 0.52%.  My guess is, without doing the math, that it would take a few millennia at least and we would likely run out of land area and be at sustainable capacity before immigrants reach 1% of population
Actually important to note that this is compared to today’s population. If population growth continues as it has (an average of 1.4M people per yer for the last 230 years since the first Census recorded 3.9M people in 1790) it would actually be less than 0.42% of the population. https://t.co/01MPUh5vux

@GOP DJIA scorecard: 29.6% = F       @DNC DJIA scorecard: 70.4% = C
To be fair the other 29.6% did happened under @DNC @POTUS with only 21% belonging to @BarackObama and the other 8.6% under @BillClinton so the next time @DonaldJTrumpJr or @realDonaldTrump or @EricTrump or @IvankaTrump tout DJIA numbers remember this.
If you look at the rest, another 29.8% happened during GWB’s presidency, so in the history of the DJIA, the all time top 20 largest single day point losses, 70.4% of them happened under @GOP @POTUS in the last 2 decades.
top 20 largest single day point losses in the history of the DJIA happened this year under @realDonaldTrump so if he believes that the stock market is a sign of how well the economy is doing, 40.6% means he score a 59.4% on the DJIA and where I went to school that’s failing!
@realDonaldTrump likes to tout the stock market as proof how the economy is great under him so let’s judge that: 5/10 of the all time largest single day point losses of the DJIA happened in 2018 alone, if you expand it to the top 20 it’s 7/20. In point value, 40.6% of the DJIA’s

I have tried to calculate it more accurately and have seen estimates as high as $6M per averaging out at $3.5M. At the average that’s $1.873B per year at the max we could be paying $3.21B per year to support these poor souls scratching out a meager living.
Best I can tell, the minimum cost, MINIMUM NOT AVERAGE, per congressional rep and senator to the American taxpayers is $1M per rep. At 535 members of congress that’s $535M per year it costs the government MINIMUM to support congress, and that’s an extremely conservative estimate

Keep in mind while @heidiscruz is bitching about @tedcruz @SenTedCruz $175k annual salary (3x the average American household) that the government compensation for congress doesn’t stop at their salary, the government pays salaries for their staffers and aides, office leases,
If you or your spouse makes $175k per year and the other has to work AT ALL let alone 70+ hours per week then you might have a problem, seems to me like you are living beyond your means if that is not enough. That is more than 3x the average household income. #1PctProblems

2020 census. We have to take this opportunity and end 2 decades of republican rule and restore democracy to our state. Vote blue, don’t retain Lawson, and vote yes on amendment 4!

Justice Lawson is on the ballot for retention (a @FLGovScott appointee). That means that the next Fl governor could have 4 appointments to the 7 member Fl SC, meaning the court could flip if @AndrewGillum is elected or be a 7 conservative member court if @RonDeSantisFL is elected

Important to remember that the justice Kavanaugh is nominated to replace, Anthony Kennedy, was UNANIMOUSLY confirmed out of a DEMOCRAT controlled JC 14-0 and UNANIMOUSLY confirmed by a DEMOCRAT controlled senate 97-0. It’s a dishonor and a disgrace to replace him with Kavanaugh.
2 of the 9 top lawmakers will be accused sexual predators, these are the people who are supposed to be above reproach, when your accused of anything you are not above reproach. Kavanaugh should not be confirmed and Thomas should be impeached.
When he is confirmed, and yes I say when because realistically he will be confirmed wether it’s right or not, Kavanaugh will be one of 2 out of 9 members of the highest court in the country who are credibly accused of sexual harassment/assault.
Remember in his defense of Thomas in 91’ @hatch referees to his critics as “the liberal plantation”. This is a bigoted racist who was defended and praised 3 credibly accused sexual assaulters to serve in high office in Thomas, @realDonaldTrump , and now Kavanaugh.
And it’s also disgusting that @senorrinhatch who sat on the committee in 91’ and defended Clarence Thomas is still there and again jumping to the defense of an accused assaulter and attacking the victim.

deficit hawk who voted for the #GOPTaxScam even after he acknowledged that it would add the the debt, he didn’t care about the one thing he claimed to stand for the most. Lastly @SenSasse ..... well I don’t know much about Sasse because I haven’t been looking into him so I guess
is gone in January and his possible replacement is a complete trumpist. His dancing around the executive authority issues with Kavanaugh was pointless, it will not deter his vote. And that brings us to @SenBobCorker who was supposed to be the most ardent conservative
running against 5 other candidates in the general election all but assuring her election even though she has never managed to win a majority, only a plurality. Now @JeffFlake traded his vote on the #GOPTaxScam for a #DACA fix and where did that go? Election is in 2 months and he
have gotten the nom again and she would still be supporting a party that does not care about her, just her vote since she was the one elected. Murkowski has no backbone anymore than Collins, she’ll confirm Kavanaugh and the only thing we can hope for is that in 2022 she is not
that she continues to support and vote republican, a party that clearly didn’t support her, and of you think they saw the error of their ways in 2016 and that’s why she got the republican nomination, no, the guy who got the nom in 2010 ran independent in 2016, so he likely could
If you want an idea of how principled she is then look back at her 2010 election, @GOP voters elected another candidate over her despite her having been elected to and served a full term as a republican and she had to run on a write in campaign to retain her seat, and after all
her when he vacated it to take on his new position as Governor, a seat that has been held by the Murkowski family since 1981, by the time she is up for re-election in 2022 they will have held the seat for 42 years, certainly not as despicable as @senorrinhatch but close.
is any kind of hero Maine voters should organize and let her know that the next 2 years will be her last in the senate because she has failed in her duties. And if you think @lisamurkowski is a hero, the latest in the Murkowski Dynasty, sitting in a senate seat her father gave
#GOPTaxScam and she certainly is not a champion for women’s rights and pro choice. She has already publicly stated that she believes Kavanaugh’s lie despite being shown an email contradicting it and is undeterred, she’s already justified her vote. Instead of treating her like she
Democrats/liberals/progressives need to stop looking to @SenateGOP and @HouseGOP as saviors or as protection from @realDonaldTrump and the far right agenda, IT’S THEIR AGENDA TOO! @SenatorCollins was not the savior for healthcare for which she traded her vote for on the
anti women’s rights, far right, religiously biased justice who is going to advance the conservative/republican/evangelical agenda on the Supreme Court for likely the next 3-4 decades. They want him there as much as any other @SenateGOP regardless of Trump.
@SenSasse @SenBobCorker @JeffFlake are going to vote for Kavanaugh no matter what because he’s not Trumps pick, he’s the @Heritage pick, he’s the @NRA pick, he’s the @GOP pick, he’s the evangelical pick, he’s a conservative, pro corp., anti LGBT, anti gun control, https://t.co/D25eHW3Vh6

Amazons net income for the Q1 of 2018 was $1.6B. $1.6B/3/30= approximately $17.8M. Amazon profited $17.8M per day in the first 3 months of this year meaning it took them 17 hours to make over operating costs the money for the tax for the whole year.
For those who are defending amazon for opposing this housing and homeless tax in Seattle let me break it down for you. The tax was $275 per employee (yearly), and amazon employs 45,000 employees in Seattle. So they would have owed approximately $12.4M (yearly). https://t.co/CWl27wFATf

Being happy about my first daughter did not mean I wasn’t sad or didn’t care about my mother passing.
tragedies are important but life is also always moving and we don’t stop because of a tragedy, we move forward and fight against tragedy and injustice while celebrating the good moments that continue to come along. I found out I was having my first daughter the day my mom passed.
For those of you acting like people don’t care about the horrific mass shootings taking place because we choose to celebrate a joyous occasion you should re-evaluate who you decide to criticize. I can be happy for the royal couple and still care about tragedies as well, yes the

It’s very disheartening that our representatives overlook all this because of an apology from a proven and professional liar. Double shame for @SenBillNelson for voting to confirm #StolenValor @SecPompeo to be SOS and now #TortureCzar Haspel to lead CIA
And we are to believe that she is going to stand as an impartial leader of the @CIA and if necessary stand up to the @POTUS ? She is involved in destroying evidence of her and the CIA’s involvement in torture and couldn’t even supposedly stand up to her bosses.
and who until this day has never shown any remorse or questioning of those actions, a person who until she needed the votes refused to condemn actions that were immoral and unethical until now and even now still claims we gained valuable intelligence from those actions.
Consider this, a professional and successful spy or intelligence/counterintelligence operative is by definition a liar, that can not be disputed. So isn’t it possible that Haspel is lying to @SenateDems in order to get confirmed? This is a person who operated a torture site https://t.co/9oyW58kIp8

You know not once in 8 years did I hear @BarackObama say a single word about staying in office past his term yet plenty of people would tell me he was going to take over the government and declare Marshall law and refuse to step down. Not once did he give that indication.
@secupp Also as stated those numbers come from the CDC and GVA, a government agency and a nonpartisan group. I found your number on the NSSF website which is a gun lobbying group, I’m not saying it’s wrong but I don’t believe that should be a credible source for a debate.
@secupp There have been 157,000+ gun deaths in America (not sure if your number was solely American jobs) from 2012-2017(according to CDC and the GVA). So more accurately the firearms industry has created less than -66,000 jobs in the past 5 years. That’s profits, not people.

Every civilian that calls for this ridiculous action does so because they know it’s not them fighting and putting their lives on the line. Cowards like Trump and Bolton and #StolenValor warrior Pompeo are paying for these decisions with other people’s blood.

3/ independently or act as a rubber stamp for the president.  This is important to me as I am a disabled combat veteran myself.  Thank you for your time.

6/ veterans but that you believe anyone should be able to commit stolen valor and use that to attain political or personal gain or favor.  I don’t expect you to change your position based on my letter but you should at a minimum publicly acknowledge that you are aware of his lies
5/ immediately and publicly oppose his nomination to be SOS and prove that as a fellow veteran you do not support any act of Stolen Valor or lying about military service or qualification in order to gain position status.  To not do so would show you not only don’t care about
4/ this blatant disrespect to all veterans.  He has lied and as such has discredited himself, the US Army, and all veterans in every branch of service.  That alone which is not currently being confronted should disqualify him on the basis of ethics and integrity.  I urge you to

As a disabled vet, I am disgusted that Pompeo who is a veteran would lie about service in combat and that senators and congressman would repeat and perpetuate that same lie as his qualifications to be SOS. It’s appalling and is also #StolenValor
These senators come from all service branches and by not immediately withdrawing support for Pompeo they dishonor all military service branches, the AD soldiers/sailors/airmen/marines, and their veterans who have fought in, been injured in, and died in combat.
By continuing to support Pompeo who has now been confirmed as having lied about his military service and claimed to be a combat veteran when he never deployed and trading off that experience for almost 30 years, all of the above mentioned senators are supporting #StolenValor

@marcorubio is going to confirm @RepJBridenstine for NASA because the  administrations “insistence”? That’s not a check on nominees that’s a rubber stamp. Here let me hire this pedophile to watch kids because my boss who’s also a pedophile insisted. No? https://t.co/7gEjOVyfYY

Like the government waste of $38M to research and plan the border wall that may never be built, the presidents travel, the drug companies outrageous profits, the cabinets travel and other expenses they are saddling taxpayers with, and the list can go on.
throughout the entire family over just letting the soldier or veteran take a pill to fix a problem caused by military service and have a healthy sex life with his wife. So stop attacking one medical issue to support another and put your attacks where they belong,
News flash when a mans sexual organs don’t function he can’t make love to his wife so they may fight or have marital problems and those problems may eventually be transferred to other lesser problems to be taken out on the kids and now this has caused discourse and mental anguish
None of these problems are the fault of the soldier or veteran so why do people keep attacking the solution? Because you don’t think viagra is necessary or should be covered? It’s not the governments problem that his organs don’t work even if that is a result of service?
What people don’t seem to understand is that soldiers are sexually assaulted, they receive physical and mental injuries, and they are sometimes put on medications for mental health/PTSD/other physical problems. All of these can lead to a genitourinary problem.

The right and the Trump Camp: oh so now the GI Bill we give you is not enough? All you did was risk your life it’s not like you died. We did inscrease the time frame for using it. If you can’t get a job with just a bachelors degree then you’re obviously lazy. 6/
The right and the Trump Camp: you ungrateful turds should be appreciative of the healthcare you have, it’s not our fault if you don’t care of yourself and die before getting treatment. 5/
The right and the Trump Camp: we are going to cut SNAP funding because what don’t you get? It’s our money and why should we provide food benefits, you are getting the small raises we grudgingly give you every year. 4/
The right and the Trump Camp: you ungrateful beggars, you should be satisfied with the small raises we give you when we feel like it, it is after all our money that the government steals from us in the form of taxes. 3/
Service members/their families: why don’t you pay us more? Or increase SNAP funding that we depend on? Or provide us with healthcare second to none when we leave the military? Or increase or education benefits when we leave the military? Maybe some dependent benefits as vets? 2/
The right and the Trump Camp: lets have a big expensive parade and force service members to prepare for and march in it because we love our military so much and that’s the only way to show it is to make you march and sweat for @realDonaldTrump as he reviews you. 1/

Something new I’m not afraid to admit, I had to look up how to spell chauvinist today in order to counter an insinuation that I’m challenging someone based on gender when I didn’t know what their gender was. I’m not a male... shit it’s not autocorrecting so google!
@MarcVanschaick Fair enough, my only point is @ArmyTimes started this bad article but @thedailybeast is taking all the hits on both their tweet and the quote/retweet from @votevets
@ilmgal @thedailybeast @ArmyTimes Or maybe you’re insinuating that I’m only questioning/challenging you because you’re a woman and I’m a man and therefore I find women inferior? Nice way to flip the issue and make the claim that I must be a chauvinist.
@ilmgal @thedailybeast @ArmyTimes Why is gender even an issue here? First of all I didn’t even know you were a woman until you pointed it out because gender has nothing to die with intelligence if that’s what you’re insinuating.
@ilmgal @thedailybeast @ArmyTimes I don’t care what the headline says, what the ARTICLE says is what is at issue here, that is the substance of a source, you don’t source a headline you source what is written in an article and therefore they are essentially the same.
@obstinategypsy @thedailybeast @ArmyTimes I read the article and the article has different wording but the same claim in terms of context. Headlines are headlines, what is said in the article is substance and therefore important.
Let’s congratulate @realDonaldTrump @POTUS on another historic stock market record, the largest loss in the entire history of the DJIA! 1175 points! Way to go Trump, another record! Tweet that out @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump @IvankaTrump
These are the statements of a dictator folks! https://t.co/I1jBtD5VRX
@obstinategypsy @thedailybeast @ArmyTimes You’re missing the point, first his article was supposed to be a positive one about the inclusion of women in combat MOS’s but the source(Army Times)screwed it up. DB used a credible source with just bad wording, it doesn’t invalidate either article.
@ilmgal @thedailybeast @ArmyTimes Standing by your opinion doesn’t make it more valid or right, and if you read all of my comments on this and the main DB article you would see I said multiple times the picture is definitely their mistake and they can own that, but maybe you don’t read as well as you think.
@MarcVanschaick “They should have written it better” was meant about the Army Times as referenced in that comment, not the Daily Beast.
@DAVEfromMN @votevets If it were just light hearted jabbing that would be fine but this goes beyond that, the comments on the Daily Beast original tweet are even worse, all I’m trying to do is point out they sourced an article from a reputable source that was badly worded, so give them a break
@970wfla There was a lot of key information left out of this conversation.
@Look4English @thedailybeast @ArmyTimes Read AT again “Now, the Army is opening up three more posts for potential assignment” “hey are the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky” same meaning just different wording than DB article.
@Look4English @thedailybeast @ArmyTimes SECDEF Gates was just the top example of the “tip of the spear” quote, you’ll find it on multiple heraldry sites as well as multiple military affiliated sites like Ranger Up who quotes in a shirt description they claim is “officially licensed by the US Army”
@Look4English @thedailybeast @ArmyTimes Like I said before, the pic is totally on them but just because you don’t believe that Military Times is not a credible source does not make it so, they do fairly diligent reporting (I read them every publication while on AD) it’s not big assumptions, it’s a reasonable one.
@Look4English @thedailybeast @ArmyTimes They didn’t mindlessly pass it on, they clearly read the article and reported on it in their own manner but kept the significant tone of information from the original article. They probably thought, and rightfully so, the the Army Times was a credible source for Army news.
@MarcVanschaick Using the Army Times as your source for an article related to the army is not haphazardly posting an article. They sometimes write opinion pieces but this was an article regarding changes to army policy, they should have written it better.
This nominee is disgustingly bigoted and an embarrassment. This is typical for this administration. https://t.co/u7BKmabHn0
@votevets @ArmyTimes I’ll stipulate that the photo is totally the fault of Daily Beast.
@DAVEfromMN @votevets Maybe talk to SECDEF Gates, and every army merchandise and heraldry site that claims otherwise. https://t.co/gqxCssHVs8“tip-of-the-spear”/
@votevets How about instead of criticizing the headline you read the article and realize it came from the @ArmyTimes and the fault of the reporting lies with them, they should have known better and worded it properly.
@thedailybeast And for those of you with you underwear in a bunch over the “tip of he spear” comment, why don’t you write SECDEF gates and let him know and while you’re at it contact all the vendors and news agency that cite the same thing https://t.co/gqxCssHVs8“tip-of-the-spear”/
@thedailybeast Look, aside from the photo mishap, did anyone criticizing them read the article? They got it from @ArmyTimes and that’s how it was portrayed there. So if you want to be mad at sloppy reporting there you go, redirect it towards the newspaper that should know better.
@Reuters Yet another example of what happens when you put a rotten snake like @MickMulvaneyOMB in charge of the @CFPB it’s the damn CONSUMER PROTECTION NOT CORPORATE PROTECTION!

@HouseTermLimits @RepDonBacon @RepJBridenstine @RepSeanDuffy @CongPalazzo @RepDeSantis @RepAndyHarrisMD @RepGallagher @RepMikeCoffman @RepDavid Funny how one of the members of this group has served 8yrs in State House, followed by 8yrs in State Senate, and now 8yrs in US House, so is 24yrs (since he was 45) not long term? Pot calling the kettle black.
Not saying it never happened but that was long ago when mortality rates were higher and left expectancy was lower, certainly not in the 70’s and 80’s, you’re rationale for this position is completely false and has no basis in fact.

@RepDennisRoss This is why we need to #FlipFlDistrict15 because Dennis Ross isn’t looking out for us but rather towing the GOP line, lining the pockets of the wealthy from the pockets of his own constituents.
@RepDennisRoss You’re useless and worthless, you’re a disgrace to Florida and the people of District 15. You applaud the corruption of the CFPB’s leadership with a smug dick like Mulvaney when they are the ones looking out for the people. You should resign but I’ll settle for you losing in 2018
@ReaganBattalion That’s absolute biased horseshit! That was not verbal abuse from Pelosi, that was regret her colleagues are pawns of Trump who verbally abuses everyone including members of his own party. Reagan would not be pleased this is how people represent him.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump You Senator are a real POS, TRUMP OPENLY STATED HE DID NOT SEE A DEAL, THAT IS A PRECONCEPTION ABOUT THE MEETING OUTCOME HE EXPRESSED SO WHY ARE THEY WASTING THEIR TIME WITH HIM? If you cared more about the average American than your party you would understand.
@RepDennisRoss @ismurray Big surprise that Ross supports attacks on the CFPB, he doesn’t care about people or his constituents and he should go in 2018, I’m sick of being represented by this lying cowardly turd! #FlipFlDistrict15
@SenateMajLdr and @SpeakerRyan you are both spineless cowards to blame democrats after Trump openly stated that he did not anticipate a deal. Come on guys. https://t.co/JOoxlGEyz3
I blame congress for this and any attack on reporters because they seated Gianforte after he physically assaulted a reported, lied about it, and then plead guilty to misdemeanor assault. They set a precedent that republicans can do what they want with no repercussions. https://t.co/3zKDMEolmJ
@markadams @trywearingpants @JohnCornyn In the same ruling they recognized that the possibility of division “through revolution or consent of the states”.
@markadams @trywearingpants @JohnCornyn And constitutions were changed.
@markadams @trywearingpants @JohnCornyn You linked to it and that is how I know from reading it you left out the statement about sufficient population, you stopped short of the statement that they could be entered as slave states. I never said they repealed all laws but during reconstruction state government and
@markadams @trywearingpants @JohnCornyn Furthermore changes were made to state governments and constitutions after the civil war and this document is likely invalid due to those changes. Nice try but you can’t take a passage from a document and not recognize the document as a whole.
@markadams @trywearingpants @JohnCornyn Secession was proved to be and technically under the constitution is still legal, recognition is irrelevant. The point also still stands that this document which predates the civil war (it also states that the states introduced may be slave states) is not valid today
@JohnCornyn Ya senator, those are called SMART PEOPLE who know that this document would no longer be relevant since Tx seceded and was readmitted and the poster left out an important provision. You’re a disgrace because you don’t even know the laws governing your own state.
@markadams @trywearingpants @JohnCornyn Your ... left out the provision that stated “and having sufficient population”. Also this document was written in 1845 when Texas was first admitted to the union, They seceded from the union and came back, what do those documents state? I’m sure this would not be accepted.
@JohnCornyn Explain your logic senator, Ca is 1st in population and 11th in density whereas Tx is 2nd in population and 26th in density, if it’s the BS size argument then Ak would be more states with more senators even though it’s 48th in population and 50th in density? You’re a moron sir.

@ericvsthem @AndyRichter True
CORRECTION: @senorrinhatch is ranked the 25th wealthiest member of the senate as of 2016 (he was 44th in 2009).
@AndyRichter CORRECTION: The ranking of 44th was from 2009, as of 2016 he is 25th!
@ericvsthem @AndyRichter  https://t.co/HyoA56VSFZ
@ericvsthem @AndyRichter According to the same source (https://t.co/0kpFN1Bunr) he is ranked 80th in the senate and his net worth is just under 600k. And as you can see from these graphs he is way below the median where Hatch is above. https://t.co/RwzOAIKapy
@ChuckGrassley is a partisan embarrassment, this is the last step in the complete degradation of the judicial nomination and confirmation process. Also it means he is a liar and not true to his word. Republicans obstructed Obama but now they’ve had enough?
@AndyRichter The 44th wealthiest member of the senate claims to not be for the wealthy and gets upset when accused of it? When someone with a net worth of between 4-5 mil says they are looking out for me, call me crazy but I’m skeptical of the tax plan they’ll create.
@senorrinhatch @senorrinhatch is as much a champion for the little guy any other wealthy conservative, he’s only worried about his fortune and those of the wealthy he serves. He is ranked the 44th wealthiest member of the senate, hardly someone looking out for the none wealthy.
@senorrinhatch Add to this that prior to starting his senate tenure at 43 yo he was an attorney for 14 years, he has authored 3 books and current estimates gauge his net worth between 4-5 mil. His family has been involved in lobbying possibly benefiting from his position.
So in this video, @senorrinhatch claims that he fights for the common man and he came from lower middle class. I can’t dispute his claim but what I do know is that over the last 40 years he has been paid $5,241,161 in senate salary. https://t.co/TZ6dQlz2hu
