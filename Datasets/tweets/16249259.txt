@TheRealWampa Interesting point.  I always thought Brown's candidacy was stronger on paper than it was in reality.

Bill Broomfield's death reminds me of my late friend Bill Frenzel of Minnesota.  Like Broomfield, Frenzel was one of the giants of the Republican Conference in the House who never got the chance to serve in the majority.
Only 13 House Republicans stood up to vote no on Trump's use of emergency powers. Hopefully far more will stand up and denounce the despicable tweet today by Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz aimed at silencing Michael Cohen. Maybe Melania will talk to him about the ugliness of bullying.
William Broomfield, a Michigan Republican who was one of the leading foreign policy specialists during much of his 36 years in the House (1957-92), is dead at age 96.
House votes 245-182 to terminate Trump's national emergency plan for the border wall.  Thirteen Republicans vote yes; total is not enough to override expected Trump veto.  Senate vote expected by mid-March.
The House is now voting on the bill that would end Trump's "emergency" declaration regarding the border wall.  It's expected to pass in the Democratic-majority House.  The key question: how many Republicans will vote for it.

And the reason I shut down the government, causing chaos for hundreds of thousands of people, is ... why?
Trump ignores the reality behind the situation, but the bottom line is this: he is ending the government shutdown, albeit 35 days later than he should have, and the govt will be open for 3 weeks, thru Feb. 15, as negotiations continue.

@Wallacewriter 60 Minutes did a tremendous story on the problem with opioids in October 2017 and Marino was featured, not so favorably.
@Wallacewriter There were rumors about his relationship with a guy with alleged mob ties years ago, and Trump tried to appoint him drug czar but he got bad press over his efforts to weaken fed control of opioids.  Let's see.
@Wallacewriter The fact that he was only re-elected two months ago?  Yes indeedy.

Hyde-Smith is now up 12 points with 68% of the vote counted.  Methinks they will be calling the race pretty soon. #MSRunoff
One-quarter of the vote counted in #MSSen race, and Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-white) leads Mike Espy (D-black) by 11 percentage points.

It's today:  #MississippiSenateRace runoff between appointed Sen. #CindyHydeSmith (R-white) &amp; #MikeEspy (D-black). Trump carried MS by 18%.  No Dem has won Senate race here since '82.  Polls close at 8pm Eastern.

@bronxinNC Correct.  And if they lose, they'll be +1.
It's all over in Florida:  Gov. #RickScott (R) has defeated Sen. Bill Nelson (D) for Nelson's Senate seat, and #RonDeSantis (R) beat Andrew Gillum (D) for governor.  Both Democrats have conceded.  Pending the 11/27 Mississippi runoff, it's +2 for the GOP in the Senate.

@markzbarabak But that’s true of almost every midterm election. If Bush Sr. had been re-elected in ‘92, does anyone think there would have been a Gingrich revolution in ‘94?

AP calls #KyrstenSinema (D) the winner in #AZSEN race.  Her victory, for the seat vacated by Jeff Flake (R), gives the Dems 2 pickups (along with #NVSen).  GOP has 3 -- ND, IN &amp; MO -- and possibly a fourth, pending #RECOUNTFLORIDA.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions submits his resignation to President Trump.
@joanwalsh Absolutely infuriating and disgraceful.
@Mrdadelus Now listen to the rest of the news conference. Night and day.
In his post-election press conference, Trump lists those Republicans who failed to embrace him and lost -- Mia Love, Mike Coffman, Barbara Comstock, others -- with an almost gleeful tone ("too bad Mike," etc.).  Wow.
This press conference has crossed the line.  It is shameful.  I'm turning it off.
Connecticut Republicans hoped that the unpopular Gov. Dan Malloy (D) would lead to their taking over the governorship this year, but it's not to be:  Ned Lamont (D) eked out a win over Bob Stefanowski (R).  Only one GOP gov. pickup:  Alaska.
A night of surprises, a Democratic House, an even more Republican Senate, and some gubernatorial winners of note.  And oh, the 2020 election starts right now.  Today on @CapRadioInsight with Beth Ruyak at 9:06am Pacific/12:06pm Eastern.
Keith Ellison, the Minnesota Democratic congressman whose campaign was rocked by accusations of physical assault by an ex-girlfriend, is elected state attorney general.
Too close to call in #Montana Senate, but Dem incumbent Jon Tester is trailing GOP challenger Matt Rosendale.  Trump really wanted this one.
In a night of big GOP wins for the Senate, Democrats do get one takeaway:  Rep. Jacky Rosen (D) ousts GOP incumbent Dean Heller in Nevada.
Scott Walker (R) loses his bid for another term as governor of Wisconsin, falling to Tony Evers (D).
In the unlikely event that you haven't gotten your fill of political news tonight ... a review Wednesday on @CapRadioInsight with Beth Ruyak -- 9:06am Pacific/12:06pm Eastern.
The thought of long lines of voters -- sometimes lasting 2 or 3 hours -- is in a way encouraging, an indication that the electorate was energized.  At the same time, it shows how short-sighted it is with all these efforts to reduce the number of polling places around the country.
Democrats win the House, GOP gains in Senate -- as nearly everyone predicted.  But GOP is likely to win some of the most closely watched races (Kemp over Abrams in #GA, DeSantis over Gillum in #FL, Cruz over Beto in #TX).
@k_kypers Gottheimer now has a 9-point lead.  Certainly closer than anyone thought -- it wasn't even on my list -- but with 80% of the vote counted, it doesn't look like a GOP pickup.
98% counted in #Florida Senate, Rick Scott (R) has a half-point (64,000) vote lead over Sen. Bill Nelson (D).
In #Kansas gov race, NBC calls Laura Kelly (D) the winner over Trump favorite Kris Kobach (R), the secretary of state and proponent of voter protection plan.  Probably because of fraudulent votes?🙄
With 98% counted in #Florida gov race, Ron DeSantis (R) has an 86,000 vote lead over Andrew Gillum (D).  With almost half the vote counted in #Georgia gov, Brian Kemp (R) has a sizable, 11-point lead over Stacey Abrams.
Republicans hold onto the governorships in Mass, Md., Texas, Ark., Wyo., Ala., S.C., Tenn and Okla.  But they lose the big states of Illinois (Pritzker over Rauner) and Michigan (Whitmer over Schuette).  No surprises in any of these.
@LocalJudi It's a flip insofar as it's a major state that switched parties.  Neither Illinois nor Michigan going Democrats was a surprise, but both are significant.
Florida voters pass ballot measure to restore voting rights to 1.4 million ex-felons.
More Senate winners: Roger Wicker (R-MS), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Bob Casey (D-PA), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Joe Manchin (D-WV).  Manchin's yes vote on Kavanaugh may have helped, but Morrisey (R) was not a great candidate.
Phil Bredesen may have been the best candidate Democrats could have come up with in the #TNSen race, but he still didn't come close to GOP Rep. Marsha Blackburn, who is headed for a huge win to keep Bob Corker's seat in R hands.
Two big flips:  In #Indiana Senate race, businessman Mike Braun (R) easily unseats Sen. Joe Donnelly (D).  And in #Illinois governor, billionaire J.B. Pritzker ousts GOP Gov. Bruce Rauner.
Endangered GOP Rep. Andy Barr holds on in #KY06, but the Dems have picked up 2 seats:  Donna Shalala (D) has won the #FL27 seat of retiring Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and in #VA10, Jennifer Wexton (D) ousted GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock.  Dems now need 21 to get a House majority.
More Democratic Senate winners, all expected:  Sherrod Brown (Ohio), Sheldon Whitehouse (R.I.) and Ben Cardin (Md.).
Three more Senate winners, all Democrats, all expected:  Chris Murphy (Conn.), Tom Carper (Del.) and Elizabeth Warren (Mass.).
A third of the vote has been counted in #Indiana, where Sen. Joe Donnelly (D) is trailing GOP challenger Mike Braun by double digits.
@GoMeteoric Plus, it's a reliably Republican district.
The first Dem pickup of the night?  With 75% of the vote counted in #KY06, Amy McGrath (D) has a narrow lead over GOP incumbent Andy Barr.
Republicans keep the #FL06 House seat vacated by gov. candidate Ron DeSantis.
@UNAVoterNC Ed Gillespie was a far superior candidate than the incendiary Corey Stewart.
Two Senate races called so far, neither a surprise:  re-election wins for Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.).
Potential 2020 presidential candidates on ballot today (realistic or not):	-- Elizabeth Warren (Mass.)	-- Amy Klobuchar (Minn.)	-- Kirsten Gillibrand, Andrew Cuomo (N.Y.)	-- Sherrod Brown (Ohio)	-- Beto O'Rourke (Texas)	-- Bernie Sanders (Vt.)	All but O'Rourke are favored today.

Joe Manchin says he’ll vote YES on Kavanaugh.  He’ll be the only Democrat.
Wanna know what’s really “unconscionable?”
In a dramatic and highly anticipated speech, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) says she’ll vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.  That seals it.
The most consequential speech of a Maine senator since Margaret Chase Smith’s “Declaration of Conscience” on Joe McCarthy in 1950.

@susanmreif @917wvxu @SenFeinstein Feinstein said neither she nor her staff leaked it.  She is not under investigation; it may have been a friend of Dr. Ford's.  Mueller is focusing on Trump actions, collusion or obstruction of justice or whatever; that is continuing.  I am not making midterm predictions.

This is feeling like the end of the Y.A. Tittle days.  #Giants
ABC Radio led the top of the hour news with #KellyanneConway saying she is a victim of sexual assault but still strongly supports the nomination of #BrettKavanagh to the Supreme Court.  I don’t know if this says more about Conway or ABC.
NBC News reporting that Sen. Lisa Murkowski supports Jeff Flake's attempt to delay the Senate vote on Kavanaugh for a week until there is an FBI investigation.
Sen. #JeffFlake votes yes in Judiciary Cmte on #Kavanaugh nomination but calls for a week's delay in vote of full Senate until investigation is complete.
Remember, even if #JeffFlake decided in the end to vote NO on Kavanaugh and thus defeat the nomination in the Judiciary Cmte,  it wouldn't matter in the long run.  The cmte voted 9-5 AGAINST Robert Bork in 1987, but Bork insisted on having his day in the full Senate.  And lost.
@Wallacewriter You could do both.  You can re-watch yesterday's hearing and keep saying, "Oh my God!"
@Wallacewriter A good question.  With all these allegations swirling around Kavanaugh, methinks it could give these red state Dems cover, especially Heitkamp.  You saw that Donnelly (who voted yes on Gorsuch) and Tester are NO votes.
@Wallacewriter Right; that's number 2.  Then everything is up to Heitkamp, in a tough struggle in North Dakota.
What's Twitter without rumors?  (1) Manchin, Murkowski and Collins have a deal.  The two Republican women vote no on Kavanaugh while Manchin, up for re-election in a red state, votes yes.  Kavanaugh is confirmed.  (2) All 3 vote no; Kavanaugh doomed (unless Heitkamp votes yes).
9:06am Pacific/12:06pm Eastern. https://t.co/mFQgsIKy0D
BUTTON OF THE DAY:  What a day. Not that it mattered. #buttonoftheday   #thepoliticaljunkie https://t.co/ZjSSUBMtTK
FUN FACT:  In 1991, the Senate Judiciary Cmte voted 7-7 on the Clarence Thomas nomination.  It went to the full Senate without recommendation, where the final vote on confirmation was 52-48.
With the reports that Sen. #JeffFlake (R-Courageous) will vote YES on the #Kavanaugh nomination, the Judiciary Cmte approval is assured.
RT @kasie: REMARKABLE: The American Bar Association calls for a delay in Kavanaugh’s confirmation until the FBI can investigate

I think one of the biggest surprises to learn from the coverage of today's hearings is that #MegynKelly has returned to Fox News.
One continuing thought:  Did Leffingwell lie before the Senate?  And will Peter Lawford break from his party and vote no on his confirmation?
Well, here goes.
A friend sent me this note: "From a journalist: Senior Senate Dem aide tells me there's a concern the GOP is 'now releasing anonymous allegations in an effort to make all allegations look frivolous. We’re focusing on the ones that have names attached.'" This makes sense to  me.
I honestly don't know what to make of this. But please, let's have the vote NOW before more of this stuff comes out. No FBI investigation, no questions for #MarkJudge. Or, as some are saying, This Never Happened But It Happened A Long Time Ago. https://t.co/J8wiSBVMqX #Kavanaugh

@conor_kilgore Not shocked at all.  I was just pointing out how tiny of a vote he got considering all the national press he received.
#RhodeIsland primary:  Despite concerns that Gov. Gina Raimondo (D) might have trouble with a challenge from her left, she easily won renomination tonight over former Sec/State Matt Brown.
@JudyReardon That's a fair comment.  A better way to have put that is that Levi Sanders got far more media attention, mostly in DC, than voter attention in NH.  And polls showed that throughout the primary.
Perhaps the biggest headline to come out of today's Dem primary in #NH01, in the contest to succeed retiring Rep. Carol Shea-Porter, is that Levi Sanders, son of Vermont's Bernie, is currently in 7th place, with under 2% of the vote.  With 46,000 votes cast so far, he has 830.

@thomdunn @mattlurrie nice try but that's not what I'm saying.
@thomdunn @mattlurrie Sometimes I find myself getting lazy when it comes to labels, something I should avoid, considering they are not far apart ideologically.  But there is a "left-wing" element of Pressley, Ocasio-Cortez, Andrew Gillum, etc., that feels different from other party liberals.
@jonathanbwelch Agree on both counts.  I think this was more generational than anything else.
Wow.  Rep. #MichaelCapuano, a Mass. liberal in the House 20 years, is ousted in the Democratic primary by #AyannaPressley, a left-wing challenger who hoped to, and did, emulate what Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez accomplished in NY14 -- defeat the party establishment.  #MA07
Prediction:  New Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) votes yes to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
Chuck Grassley accuses Democrats of obstructionism.  Ted Cruz reminds Democrats that "elections have consequences."  Two words:  Merrick Garland.
@Willyboy48 His age made me think this was not likely to happen.  And Ducey wanted to avoid a potentially divisive primary in 2020, which is now likely to happen.  But he is a unifying figure in the Arizona GOP, and the last thing Ducey wanted was more division as he seeks re-election.
Jon Kyl is a very smart choice to succeed McCain.  Widely respected by both wings of the Arizona GOP.  A reliable conservative.  And note: Kyl in the Senate gives the GOP a 51-49 advantage; thus Kavanaugh could survive the defection of, say, Susan Collins and still be confirmed.

Not many votes have been counted in #Arizona, but the races have been called.  In the GOP Senate primary for Jeff Flake's seat, Rep. Martha McSally is declared the winner; she'll face Rep. Kyrsten Sinema (D) in November.
Florida Dem primary for gov:  #AndrewGillum, the mayor of Tallahassee who is black, defeated ex-Rep. #GwenGraham, the daughter of former Gov/Sen Bob Graham.  Gillum will face Rep. #RonDeSantis (R) in November for the seat being vacated by now-GOP Senate nominee Rick Scott.
@ArchivesBoy Haha.  She got 4% of the vote in the GOP primary, finishing 6th.
#FLprimary House primaries: In the 9th CD, ex-Rep. Alan Grayson's comeback attempt fell way short; he lost by a 2-1 margin to incumbent Darren Soto.  In the 27th CD, looks like Donna Shalala will be Dem nominee for seat of retiring GOP Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen.

Maybe one day we'll stop noticing this, but 2 more all-female Senate races decided in today's primaries:  Sen. #TinaSmith (D-MN) vs. Karin Housley (R), and Sen. #TammyBaldwin (D-WI) vs. Leah Vukmir (R).  The first: Sen. Margaret Chase Smith (R-ME) vs. Lucia Cormier (D), 1960.
A bad night for Nazis:  In #WI01, the seat being given up by Speaker Paul Ryan, white supremacist Paul Nehlen finished a poor third in the GOP primary.
Top #Minnesota primary results:  #KeithEllison (D), giving up his House seat to run for atty general, was hit by domestic abuse charges just days before the vote.  He won easily.  And while only 60% is in, it looks like ex-Gov. #TimPawlenty's comeback effort will fall short.
My favorite result of the night:  Brooke Paige is leading in the #Vermont GOP primary to take on Sen. Sanders.  But he's also already won the GOP primary for the House seat, attorney general, secretary of state, state auditor and state treasurer.  I'm not making this up!
@politico Brooke Paige is not a "she."
Only a quarter of the vote has been counted, but it's worth noting that in the #Minnesota Dem primary for atty gen, Rep. #KeithEllison, hit by late charges of domestic abuse, holds a huge lead in a multi-candidate field.
Connecticut:  #NedLamont, who beat Joe Lieberman in the 2006 Senate primary but lost in the general election when Joe ran as an indy, wins the Dem gov primary; GOP contest still too close to call.  Dan Malloy (D), perhaps the most unpopular gov. in the US, is retiring.
@awnry I'm not coming from a "blue" side.  Or a "red" side.  I'm just watching this stuff.
It's official:  Jeff Colyer, who became the gov of #Kansas following Sam Brownback's departure, has conceded the GOP gov. primary to #KrisKobach.  Kobach had led by 210 votes out of more than 313,000 cast.
Hi, my name is Bernie Sanders and I want nothing to do with the Democratic Party's nomination for the Senate from my home state of Vermont this year but I hope you pick me as the Democratic Party's nominee for president in 2020.
As is usual, #BernieSanders has won the Democratic primary for the Senate in #Vermont, and, as is usual, he is expected to decline the nomination and seek a 3rd term as an independent.
@HesDanTheMan @ananavarro A governor cannot appoint a replacement House member, unlike in the case of a Senate vacancy.  If Collins were to resign -- and he says he won't -- the seat could have been left vacant until Jan. 3rd, or Cuomo could have called for a concurrent special election in November.

@thomascbowen  https://t.co/gXgDzgW8hm
@thomascbowen 1 of 3 Harold Washington boards. https://t.co/AAnUs5KqIr
@thomascbowen You’re right!
Two Republican House incumbents in #Washington, Jaime Herrera Beutler and Cathy McMorris Rodgers, did not look very strong in their jungle primary contests; both barely topped their closest Dem opponents.  Two seats to watch in November.
In the Senate primary in #Washington, where all candidates run on the same ballot regardless of party and the top 2 advance to November, it will be Sen. Maria Cantwell (D) vs. former TV journalist Susan Hutchison (R).
Useless #Kansas trivia:  The last time an unelected statewide official was defeated in the primary came in 1996, when Sheila Frahm, appointed to replace Sen. Bob Dole, who had resigned his seat, lost the Republican contest to Rep. Sam Brownback.
80% counted in Kansas and now Gov. Jeff Colyer has retaken the lead: just under 700 votes ahead of Kris Kobach.
Update from NBC News on #OH12:  Ohio special election race remains too close to call due to current  vote count, and provisional ballots that still need to be counted.   Provisional ballots will be counted within the next 10 days.   The vote then must be certified by Aug. 24.
@Shahooster @MPRnews oops, yes.
With 76% of the vote counted in the #Kansas GOP gov. primary, Kris Kobach has taken a 500-vote lead over Gov. Jeff Colyer.
You know what?  I'm going to stop paying attention to #Yankee games for the next couple of weeks.  It's not worth it and my blood pressure doesn't need it.
@jfarrelljohns Yes, he's the guy who ran as an independent against GOP Sen. Pat Roberts in 2014 (when there was no Democratic candidate) and received nearly 43 percent of the vote.
Let the spin begin in #OH12, where officially it's too close to call but where Balderson (R) will, barring a recount, eke out a win over O'Connor (D).  Dems: We came very close in a district that never goes R.  GOP: We held a seat where the Dems had the momentum.  Both are right.
With 2/3 of the vote counted in the #Kansas GOP gubernatorial primary, Gov. Jeff Colyer's lead over Sec/State Kris Kobach is now down to fewer than a thousand votes.
@jfarrelljohns Yes, but there's also an independent, Greg Orman, who is also going to be on the November ballot.  Democrats claim, with some justification, that Orman will split the anti-Republican vote and allow whomever the GOP puts up to win.
A rare victory for the unions:  #Missouri voters have overwhelmingly voted down the state's right-to-work law that was put into place last year.
As for that closely-watched GOP gov primary in #Kansas:  With half the vote counted, it's neck and neck between Gov. Jeff Colyer (41%) and Sec/State Kris Kobach (40.1%).  Would be fun if Kobach lost because of millions of illegal votes in Kansas.
Note about the Green Party candidate in #OH12:  With 99% of the vote counted, he has 1,120 votes;  Troy Balderson's (R) lead over Danny O'Connor (D) is 1,688.  Not a Ralph Nader situation at this point.
99% counted in #OH12 and Troy Balderson (R) is pulling ahead, slightly: a lead of 1,688 votes over Danny O'Connor (D).  Dems will say this is a seat GOP should've won big; GOP will be very happy with simply a win.  Last Dem victory here: 1980.
In the battle for the Senate in #MichiganPrimary, Debbie Stabenow (D), seeking a 4th term, is heavily favored in November over veteran John James (R), endorsed by Trump &amp; Kid Rock (!).  James is the first black R to run statewide in Mich. since gov. nominee Bill Lucas in 1986.
95% counted in #OH12:  Balderson (R) up by 741 over O'Connor (D).  Green Party candidate has 1,102.
It will be one of the closely watched Senate races in November, but today's #MissouriPrimary was, as expected, no contest:  Sen. Claire McCaskill (D), seeking a 3rd term, will face state AG Josh Hawley (R).
The frontrunners have won their primaries in the #MichiganPrimary for governor:  AG Bill Schuette (R) and former state Sen.  Gretchen Whitmer (D).  Incumbent Rick Snyder (R) is term limited.
89% of the votes in #OH12 have been counted and Troy Balderson (R) holds a lead of 1,031 over Danny O'Connor (D) -- 50% to 49.4%.  A Green Party candidate has 1,056 votes.

Top two contests to watch on Tuesday:  The special election in #OH12 between Troy Balderson (R) and Danny O'Connor (D), a seat the Dems haven't won since 1980.  Also, the GOP gov primary in #Kansas, featuring #KrisKobach, newly endorsed by Trump, vs. incumbent Gov. Jeff Colyer.

@brithume Once upon a time the GOP was the party of principle; it was Republicans who went to Nixon and told him his time was up.  Now Republicans will do whatever it takes, tearing down whatever institutions are necessary, in order to protect this president.  They are unrecognizable.

Rep. #MarkSanford (R-SC), best known for his extra-marital affair during his days as governor but also known as a strong Trump critic in the House, lost his primary tonight following an attack on him by Trump.  He's the 2nd House member to lose primary (Robert Pittenger, R-NC)
We'll talk about #Maine's #RankedChoiceVoting system for governor on this week's Political Junkie program.  But here's a fun fact:  Of the state's last 8 gov. elections, only one -- in 1998 when Angus King (I) was re-elected -- did the winner receive a majority of the vote.
Corey Stewart, who defended Confederate monuments during his narrow loss for governor in the 2017 Virginia Republican primary, narrowly wins the GOP Senate nomination and will face Sen. Tim Kaine (D) in November.
Trump mocks Rep. Mark Sanford (R-SC), a frequent critic running for renomination in today's primary, tweeting, "He's better off in Argentina."  Only someone with absolutely no self-awareness like Donald Trump can mock someone else's extramarital affairs.

The whole world is watching him.  Better put, the whole world can't take its eyes off him.  It's exactly what he craves.  For those who think he is a goner in 2020, you may have to readjust your settings.

Part 3: First of all, they all showed up wearing suits; excuse me, Eagles' fans are not going to attend a rally wearing suits.  And when a reporter asked many attendees for the name of the Eagles' starting quarterback, nobody at the rally had a clue.
Part 2: .(As if Mike Pence going to an Indianapolis Colts game and leaving after 2 minutes because a player took a knee wasn't a political stunt.)  But it was obvious the White House's substitute event -- holding a rally with Eagles' "fans" instead -- was fake from the get go.
Part 1:  It was kind of fun watching Sarah Huckabee Sanders announce the cancellation of the White House visit by the Philadelphia Eagles and then have her *blame the team* (!) for Trump's decision, calling their actions a "political stunt."
@EdKrassen You knew something was wrong when they all showed up wearing suits.  Eagles fans are not going to attend a rally wearing suits.  Plus, none of them could name the Eagles' starting quarterback.  It reeked from the very beginning.

Two breaking stories you'll hear about in this week's #PoliticalJunkie program:	(1) Missouri Gov. #EricGreitens (R) has resigned over his involvement in a sex scandal; and 	(2) #DickTuck, the legendary political trickster, has died.
The objection to #Roseanne has nothing to do with politics. She can support Donald Trump, Jill Stein or Phineas T. Bluster for all I care. It's not about being politically correct. It's a matter of simple decency. You compare blacks to apes, you cross a line. She crossed it.
@Jakob_Zimer The fact is, people say it, regardless of their political party or persuasion.  Discouraging, but especially from someone who is such a public figure.

@bdelhanty Governor of California for two terms after the first Jerry Brown tour, 1983-90.
@Louisville_rule I don't know if the Bradley effect is a myth, but I've always said that the gun initiative was underrated and wrongly dismissed as a factor in the 1982 result.
He was a decent guy, a popular and successful governor, and someone who knew how to talk to his opponents without rancor.  Both parties can use someone like that today.  R.I.P. George Deukmejian.

@BHIndepMO You are quite right!
Fun fact:  No Democratic senator from West Virginia has been defeated for re-election by a Republican since Matthew Neely in 1928.  #politicaljunkie
@grisaitis @CarolMillerWV @LarrySabato @Redistrict Well, how about ... today?  Paul Wright won the Republican primary in NC's 12th District with 3,200 votes.
@grisaitis @CarolMillerWV @LarrySabato @Redistrict I don't know the answer but I'm pretty sure that's not a record, given all the multi-candidate primaries we've witnessed.
The big primary headline of the night:  Republicans dodge a bullet in #WestVirginia.  The GOP Senate primary was won NOT by Don Blankenship, the controversial former mine executive whom party leaders (including Trump) said would be a sure loser, but state AG Patrick Morrisey.
The big news out of the #NorthCarolina House primaries was supposed to be about Rep. Walter Jones (R-3rd), but he did fine.  One who didn't: Rep. Robert Pittenger (R-9th), who was ousted by former Charlotte pastor Mark Harris.  Pittenger is the first incumbent to lose in 2018.
Congressman Jim Renacci holds on to win the GOP Senate primary in #Ohio and will face Dem incumbent Sherrod Brown (D), seeking a third term, in November.  For governor, it's Mike DeWine (R) vs. Richard Cordray (D).
The so-called "outsider" has won the contentious GOP primary for the Senate in #Indiana.  Mike Braun, whose party credentials were questioned, ran 10 points better than 2 House members, Luke Messer and Todd Rokita.  Braun will face Sen. Joe Donnelly (D) in November.
Easy wins in the #OhioGov primary for the 2 frontrunners: AG Mike DeWine beat LG Mary Taylor for the GOP nod, and Richard Cordray beat Dennis Kucinich on the Dem side.  GOP Gov. John Kasich is term limited.
In Indiana's open 6th District, for the seat once held by Vice President Mike Pence, the winner of today's GOP primary is his brother, Greg Pence. #IndianaPrimary
Even if the U.S. ends the #IranNuclearDeal, as the president indicated today, and even if it leads to Iran going ahead with building nuclear weapons, and even if it leads to war, perhaps World War III, I still hope this won't hurt Trump's chances of winning the #NobelPeacePrize.

The thought that Virginia Sen. George Allen's political career came to  an end because of his "macaca" comment ... or that Rick Perry's presidential bid was over because he couldn't think of a third Cabinet agency he would cut ... just feels remarkable in this day and age.
@LeighRogers5 I don't feel outrage that Trump doesn't attend the correspondents dinner; in fact, I think it's a smart decision that he doesn't.  The thought of the antagonism between the president and the press in one room doesn't sound like fun to me.
@chicagotribune heartbreaking and infuriating.

Biden says if he were in high school, he would "beat the hell" out of Trump for what he does to women.  Trump says Biden "would go down fast and hard" if they had a fight.  Sadly, the only time I see the word "adult" anymore is when we're talking about porn stars. https://t.co/mtgwciYlvE
#RickSaccone (R) concedes defeat in the #PA18 special election to Democrat #ConorLamb.  But it may be temporary; the state's new congressional map may afford Saccone another shot in a different district in November.
@ChicagoHound Oh, it’s happened more often than you think. The most recent time in Illinois was in 1976. Dan Walker, who fought the bosses in his victorious 1972 campaign, turned out to be a bust and was dumped in the primary by Mike Howlett; he then lost in November to Republican Jim Thompson
@KC_Mcdunnough I know what you mean ... but this one you can put money on.
Chuy Garcia, who gave Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel a run for his money in 2015, wins the Dem primary in #IL04, the seat being vacated by the retiring Rep. Luis Gutierrez.
@GobbsJoe ... because the alternative is having the Democrats tout the fact that a Republican nominee for Congress in Illinois' 3rd District is a neo-Nazi/white supremacist/Holocaust denier.  That never looks good on a resume.
Illinois Gov. #BruceRauner (R), despite a huge $$ advantage, barely hangs on to win renomination, 52-48%, over conservative challenger Jeanne Ives.  He's a clear underdog in November against Dem opponent #JBPritzker in what could be the most expensive gov. race in history.
@IowaPeg @Maddogmattis17 Exactly.
In this week's Political Junkie program:  #IllinoisPrimary results, Trump &amp; GOP voters, a farewell to Rep. Louise Slaughter, and remembering Barack Obama's landslide loss to Rep. Bobby Rush, 18 years ago this week.  https://t.co/onoZt79YBX
@Wallacewriter I do not.  I've lost count.
@Maddogmattis17 Maybe so.  But Republicans and Democrats have been running in completely unwinnable districts since the beginning of time.   Not to mention the third party candidates who run.  But you're right of course.
@Nicholasofalexa Did I not say, several times, that Republicans have no chance in the district?  Are you really that blind?  All I'm saying is that -- again -- if I were a Republican leader in the district, I would have made sure someone other than a neo-Nazi was going to represent my party.
@ReisNielsen @GOP In fairness, the Republicans in the district, in the state and nationally have all condemned Jones, his candidacy and what he stands for.  There is no silence among Republicans on this guy.
Former NYC Council Speaker Christine Quinn, who is openly gay herself, disparages actress #CynthiaNixon's primary challenge to Gov. Andrew Cuomo, calling her an "unqualified lesbian."  Quinn backs Cuomo in the September Dem primary.
@McCrackan Well, that's about the mean age for some of the Democratic leaders these days.
RT @SteveKornacki: Anti-abortion Democrats in the House:		1978: 125	1996: 70	2007: 32	Now: 3 (will fall to 2 if Dan Lipinski loses tonight)
In the widely watched Dem primary in #IL03, with 88% of the vote counted, pro-life Rep. Dan Lipinski leads progressive challenger Marie Newman 51-49% -- a margin of just 1,600 votes.  Could you imagine what the final result would be if Richard J. Daley were still alive?
@lewisalowe @Wallacewriter He runs all the time, always gets his 5 minutes of attention, and then no one cares because he loses the primary.  I can't imagine anyone being surprised that he ran again this year.
RT @PoliticsWolf: Reminder: Lipinski's Dem legislative allies specifically gerrymandered this seat to protect him from a progressive primar…
@Wallacewriter That's the shame part.  There was no other Republican in the district who wanted to run?  No GOP leader who said we can't let the nomination go to a Nazi?
To no one's surprise -- but to the GOP's shame -- neo-Nazi/white supremacist Arthur Jones wins the Republican nomination for Congress in #Illinois' 3rd District (he ran unopposed).  In this solidly Dem district, he's not a threat to prevail in November.  But still.
J.B. Pritzker, a billionaire businessman, wins the Democratic nomination for governor in #IllinoisPrimary.  Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner has a fight on his hands for renomination; even if he survives, he's seen as vulnerable for November.
No #IllinoisPrimary results yet, but GOP Gov. Bruce Rauner is in a tough battle for renomination against a more conservative rival, and pro-life Rep. Dan Lipinski (D) has strong competition from a more progressive opponent.
@PatrickS1591 Yes, exactly.  My point is that, for Democrats in 2018, one size does not fit all.
@nyygirl333 no, you're #notkidding
True.  I'm not trying to compare Lamb with Lipinski other than to say that conservative positions that work in a GOP district may not be received the same way in a more urban CD. https://t.co/AMouKX5Lhe
@nyygirl333 I can't believe I forgot who I was replying to.
@nyygirl333 Calm down!  It doesn't look like we used any of our good pitchers this game.  I don't like to jinx things, but I feel good about this team this year.
For all the gushing about what a great candidate #ConorLamb was in #PA18, it's clear he wouldn't fit in some other CDs.  Watch today's Dem primary in #IL03, where pro-life conservative Rep. Dan Lipinski (D) is fighting for his life against progressive challenger Marie Newman.

@politicalwire You're right Taegan ... I've since posted a revised tweet.
@Politi_Kitty Did you read the entire tweet?  I'm guessing not.
PART 3:  But having said that, this is not horseshoes.  If the Democrats are going to win control of the House in 2018, they need to WIN these kinds of congressional elections.  Not just come close.
PART 2:  The GOP incumbent (before he resigned in disgrace) was so popular,  Democrats didn't even put up a candidate against him in 2014 or 2016.  The fact that tonight's Dem candidate #ConorLamb is not only competitive, he is LEADING -- is nothing short of remarkable.  MORE
A multi-part Tweet (here's part 1):  The bottom line:  No matter who is declared the winner in #PA18 -- and I  suspect that won't happen tonight -- this was an outstanding night for the Democrats.  It was a district Trump carried by 20, Romney by 17 four years earlier.  MORE
This just in:  Steve Harvey calls Miss Colombia the winner in #PA18.
@pasracic ... and James Traficant!
Oh, by the way:  Rex Tillerson was fired today.  Of course, that was so pre-noon.
@Wallacewriter In "a" new district.  I'm assuming that either Lamb or Saccone, or both, will be running in different districts in the May 15 primary.  The entire Pennsylvania congressional map has been redrawn, presumably to Democrats' advantage.
One thing not to forget regarding tonight's special election:  #PA18, as currently drawn, will no longer exist after this year.   Whoever wins tonight -- and we may not even have a winner tonight -- he will be running in a different district in the May 15 primary.
@IbatheWonderDog Baaa, humbug.
You want a close election?  With 98% of the vote counted, the margin is now ... 585 votes!  #ConorLamb 49.8%, #RickSaccone 49.6%.
This may be the correct answer regarding recount in #PA18: https://t.co/ONiEZumjfa
What I'm reading regarding a possible recount in #PA18:  "An automatic recount will occur if the margin between the candidates is 0.5 percent or less."
@WeHaveSnacks Yep, I've been saying that all along.  In fact, the former Republican incumbent, Tim Murphy, ran unopposed in 2014 and 2016.
@McCrackan one would think.  Either way.  I love suspenseful elections!
.#ConorLamb's lead is back up to 1,200 votes, with 96% counted:  50% to 49.4%.
94% of the vote is in, and #ConorLamb's (D) lead is down to 700 votes: 49.9% to #RickSaccone's (R) 49.5%.
With 87% of the vote counted in #PA18, #ConorLamb's (D) lead over #RickSaccone (R) has narrowed to 2,500 votes: 50.4% to 49%.
@PatRigley Thank you.
With 72% of the vote counted in #PA18, Democrat Conor Lamb is leading Republican Rick Saccone, 51.5% to 47.9%.
@murphymike Agree with Mike Murphy, as I always do.
So, in #PA18, with no results in yet, and with pre-election polls showing #ConorLamb (D) up by a few points over #RickSaccone (R), I think I'm predicting a slim win by ... Saccone.  I've been continuously wrong in these predictions lately, so we'll see.

Don't add George P. Bush to those who perished at the Alamo.  The Texas Land Commissioner, whose GOP primary opponents accused him of mishandling the management of the Alamo, wins renomination without needing to go to a runoff.
The first Senate primary of the 2018 cycle is in the books: #Texas.  The race will pit Sen. #TedCruz (R) vs. Rep. #BetoORourke (D). No Dem has won a Texas Senate race since Lloyd Bentsen in 1988. The Dem opponent to GOP Gov. Greg Abbott may not be known until the May 22 runoff.

@brianros1 @KeystoneObsrvr @kkondik @SteveKornacki Plus, Cochran had spent 6 years cultivating black voters.  Winter is just one example of a very popular Democratic governor in a conservative state failing to build on that popularity with a successful Senate run.

@Deb_RM_Backus Given the fact that the House is definitely up for grabs, and given the fact that Nolan struggles to win re-election, every seat is crucial.  So I would say yes.

@CharBeeHe ... because watching a president defend people like Rob Porter (just allegations!) and Roy Moore (just allegations!) while deciding others are guilty or treasonous (even if those are just allegations as well) gets a bit tedious and predictable.
Rep. Rick Nolan (D-Minn.), one of the GOP's top targets for 2018 who barely won re-election two years ago, announces his retirement.  That's 9 Dems compared to 22 GOPers.

Trump, in calling Democrats who refused to applaud his State of the Union speech "treasonous," is being compared to Joe McCarthy.  Here's my USA Today  column comparing the two ... from back in July of 2015.  https://t.co/XDXumrIXbG

So, how was the president's day today?  Well, to those who didn't applaud his #SOTU message, he likened them to having committed "treason."  And of #AdamSchiff, the president's outspoken critic and ranking Dem on the Intelligence Cmte, Trump tweeted that he "must be stopped."
@MiloVentimiglia @Logan_Shroyer @TheMandyMoore @hannahzeilexo @nilesfitch How can you be so calm?  We are all so devastated.
@Dan_Fogelman We've spent two years often looking backwards.  The ending with Tess, in the future, was nothing short of brilliant.  It helped, briefly, ease the pain and end the tears.
@SterlingKBrown brilliantly done.  We've been going backwards in both seasons.  Going into the future with Tess was just brilliant.
Somehow, I managed to survive the intensity of the #SuperBowl.  Even more amazingly, I managed to survive the intensity of #ThisIsUs-- but just barely.  But will we survive the Nunes memo?  Monday on @MPRnews at 9:06am CT/10:06am ET, and @CapRadioInsight at 9:06am PT/12:06pm ET.

Wow.
Here we go again.
Truth be told, in the end, I can live with whatever team wins the Super Bowl.  What I dread most is watching Jack die in tonight's #ThisIsUs episode that follows the game. That's going to be a tough one for me.
@McCrackan Agree.  Melissa McCarthy doing Sean Spicer (the first time) was brilliant!  Also loved "Meet Your Second Wife."  And, don't ask me why, but I was obsessed with "Space Pants."  I'm probably alone on that one.

@SKINNYCHAD Only available on my pay site.
Medical update:  Doctors say that after an hour of giving himself long standing ovations, President Trump may no longer be physically able to tweet for several months.
In other words .... NORWAY!
I think Mexico should pay for our infrastructure.  And they will.  Believe me.
I know everyone is applauding.  But if this was such a great speech, why hasn't he said "Merry Christmas" yet?
Here's one clue that something might be awry and that Robert Mueller should watch out for:  If Trump starts the speech by saying, "The state of the nation is великий"
(2 of 2)  BUT ... if I hear one analyst/pundit say that Trump sounded presidential, or if they say it's a sign Trump is becoming a changed man -- based on his reading a prepared speech for 45 minutes or an hour -- I swear I will go put my foot through the television set.
(1 of 2) I don't care if Trump takes credit for the booming economy during tonight's #SOTU.  Sure, it's not all his doing, and the uptick actually began during Obama.  But if the economy was doing poorly, we would be blaming him.  So let him celebrate the growth in the economy.
There’s something about Tuesdays at 9 pm that always makes me cry. Usually, it’s “This Is Us.”  Tonight, it’s the “State of the Union” message.
@Basement__Games @NateSilver538 Probably because it's one of a gazillion stories of obvious conflicts of interest. Don't forget Pruitt with the oil polluters, the drug czar with Big Pharma, Rick Perry hugging whomever he's hugging these days. So discouraging. Everyone is numb. And that's probably their goal.

Just in case you were wondering ... Since the #KentuckySchoolShooting, some 15 hours ago, there have been just 2 Tweets from the president:  one about "Cryin’ Chuck Schumer," and this: "Where are the 50,000 important text messages between FBI lovers Lisa Page and Peter Strzok?"

Even though it's all but certain that they will get the 60 votes to end the shutdown, CNN is reporting that Dem Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris have all voted NO.
McConnell, on the Senate floor, says it was wrong for the Dems to shut down the government over immigration/DACA, but he's glad the shutdown is about to end.  #GovernmentShutdown
@IowishEyes I understand what you are saying.  But "both sides are to blame" is "me-tooism" that is too simplistic.  I'm there for insight and analysis and that's what I give.  I'm sorry you see it as simply repeating D talking points.
Schumer, on the Senate floor, sounds like there's a deal:  short-term funding until Feb. 8, with a promise to take up DACA at that time. #GovernmentShutdown
@IowishEyes It's hard not to focus on the Republicans being the impediment to a deal when the president of the United States tweets something like this:  https://t.co/JeBQuyp3za
@IowishEyes I don't think I said the Rs are entirely to blame for the shutdown, though I do think this is overwhelmingly their fault. And I don't hold the Ds blameless at all.  You're right, DACA may not be relevant to the budget. But it's the only leverage the Ds have on the issue.

@brithume In 1995-96, with the Gingrich shutdown, yes.  And it helped Clinton win re-election in '96.  But did the GOP take the blame for the 2013 shutdown?  When voters went to the polls in 2014, Republicans did very well.
@pw_male @state_of_things I don't believe @kenrudin said that; in fact, I know he didn't.  He DID say that some Republicans, instead of trying to investigate possible Russian collusion, are doing what they can to discredit those investigating it: Comey, Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS, etc.

It's a ruthless business.  Once #Bannon attacked Trump's family, he was  finished.  Like Fredo in Godfather 2.  Look how fast the WH pushed #StephenMiller on the cable shows to say "Steve Who?"
The lesson #SteveBannon never understood:  He was not bigger than Trump.   Trump was not simply a vehicle for the revolution, and Bannon was not about to lead the revolution.  When he lost Trump, and the #Mercer family, Bannon was left with nothing.
"Fire and Fury" has claimed its first victim and of course it's not Trump:  #SteveBannon resigns, obviously under pressure, from #Breitbart.

@MeghanMcCain I wish you took a tougher line on that person who tried to humiliate and debase your father. I’m always hopeful that Republicans will see the light, but I keep waiting. In any event, Happy New Year to you and your family. And tell your Dad we’re not through with him yet.

Republicans got what they wanted: lower taxes.  Democrats got what they wanted: a win in Alabama &amp; a tie in Virginia's lower house.  And America gets what it wanted: 2 full hours of political gabbing Thursday on @WOSUAllSides 10-11am ET, and @917wvxu 1-2pm ET.  Happy Holidays!
Once, there was suspense.  But not today, when it counted.  The Senate voted 51-48, on strict party lines, to pass the #TaxBill.   (Only John McCain, who is in precarious health, did not vote.)  Once the House does its procedural correction, the bill goes to the president's desk.
@Louisville_rule A classic race, but more important, a misguided Democratic overreach in the House ... which led to bitter feelings between the two parties for years.
Want proof that EVERY VOTE COUNTS?  A recount in a VA House district has given the seat to a Democrat -- and has resulted in a 50-50 TIE in the house of delegates.  That Dem wave in VA last month was greater than anyone could have predicted.  https://t.co/nmkITHKLh0
@brithume But shouldn't the president at least be honest about this?  “This is going to cost me a fortune," he said.  "This is not good for me. Believe me.”  Would it kill him to tell the truth on this?
@StJMagistra He is an iconoclastic Republican who often votes against his party when he finds a bill or cause imperfect.
House passes #TaxBill 227-203.  No Dems vote for it.  12 Republicans vote no: 5 from NY (Zeldin, King, Donovan, Faso, Stefanik), 4 from NJ (LoBiando, Smith, Lance, Frelinghuysen), 2 from CA (Rohrabacher, Issa).  And of course Walter Jones from NC.

@riley_ronan I don't think it's an either/or type of thing.  I don't know if Democrats made a mistake in focusing on "white working class" voters in 2016, but the huge progressive/black turnout in VA and now AL was crucial in those victories.

How #DougJones won it ... and why #RoyMoore lost it.  Today on @wccoradio's "John Hines Show" at 9:35am Central/10:35am Eastern.  #AlabamaSenate
The obvious question:  Will Mitch McConnell allow Doug Jones to be sworn in before the Senate votes on Merrick Garland?
@smed63 McConnell will not allow Jones to be seated until after the Senate tax bill vote.
My thoughts EXACTLY!! https://t.co/Vym8SwXHsw
In the end, the #DougJones win was probably the best the GOP could've come away with.  #RoyMoore in the Senate would have made him an embarrassment &amp; distraction.  For more rambling and yakking, tune in Wednesday to @wccoradio's "John Hines Show" at 9:35am CT/10:35am ET.
.#USAToday editorial:  "A president who would all but call Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand a whore is not fit to clean the toilets in the Barack Obama Presidential Library or to shine the shoes of George W. Bush."
ASSOCIATED PRESS CALLS IT FOR JONES.  #AlabamaSenateRace
Fox News declaring Doug Jones (D) the winner in #AlabamaSenateElection; everyone else saying "too close to call."
86% counted in #AlabamaSenate and Doug Jones has his first lead of the night.  It's now Jones 49.3, Moore 49.1 -- a difference of 1,700 votes.
Closest #AlabamaSenateRace in history (prior to tonight):  1986, when Richard Shelby -- then a Democrat -- ousted GOP first-term incumbent Jeremiah Denton 50.3 to 49.7.  A difference of 6,800 votes out of 1.2 million cast.
85% counted in #AlabamaSenateRace and Roy Moore has dipped under 50% of the vote ... and  though he still has the lead over Doug Jones, it's shrinking.  Moore's lead is now 49.5 to 49.0 -- a difference of fewer than 5,000 votes.
It's getting closer in #AlabamaSenateRace.  With 75% in, it's Roy Moore (R) with 50.7% to 47.9% for Doug Jones (D).
@Zac_Petkanas just a rumor I made up.
Not sure if Democrats should be worried or not, but there are rumors out of #Alabama that say most poll watchers in today's Senate race only speak Russian.
@StuPolitics and Stu Rothenberg.
Analysts are saying that a lot of the vote yet to be counted in #AlabamaSenateRace is expected to favor the Democrat, Doug Jones.  But right now, with 65% of the vote counted, it's Roy Moore (R) 53%, Jones 45%
Half the vote has been counted in #AlabamaSenateRace, and Doug Jones (D) has been creeping a bit closer.  It's Roy Moore (R) with 51.2% to 47.4% for Jones.
40% counted in the #AlabamaSenateRace and Roy Moore (R) has moved slightly further ahead -- it's 52.1% vs. 46.4% for Doug Jones (D).
With just 17% of the vote counted in the #AlabamaSenateElection, it's Roy Moore (R) with 50.6% and Doug Jones (D) with 48.1%.

BUTTON OF THE DAY:  A clean sweep for the Democrats in Virginia on Tuesday, and elsewhere in the… https://t.co/f8ND9xBKmQ
@WoW_Oriyune @SteveDeaceShow @brithume That may be true, but many polls showed a Gillespie surge at the end, which led to speculation that he could/would win.
@SteveDeaceShow @brithume The obvious follow up question ... why did Trump lose Virginia in 2016 when he was winning everywhere else in the South?  And why are his numbers so poor in the Old Dominion?
Democrats sweep top 3 offices in #VirginiaElection:  Ralph Northam (governor), Justin Fairfax (lt. gov.) and Mark Herring (attorney general).
In #Detroit, Mayor Mike Duggan easily wins a second term over the son of the late mayor Coleman Young.  Four years ago Duggan became the city's first white candidate elected mayor since 1969.
In Charlotte, N.C., Vi Lyles becomes the first African American woman elected mayor.  Harvey Gantt was the city's first black mayor.
In Charlotte, N.C., Vi Lyles, who had earlier defeated the incumbent mayor in the Democratic primary, completes the job by beating Republican Kenny Smith.
Democrats sweep #VAGov, #NJGov and #NYCMayor for the first time since 1989.
Correction on #DanicaRoem's victory in Virginia:  She will be the first transgender elected to the state legislature since Althea Garrison (Mass.) in 1992 (h/t  @MewFace18 and @TransGriot).
@MewFace18 You are correct.
With 78% of the vote counted, Democrats in #VirginiaElection lead in both lt. gov. and attorney general races.
@TheRossHockman @WOSUAllSides Thanks!  November 16th.
The Associated Press calls #RalphNortham (D) the winner in hot #VirginiaGovernor race.
In a widely watched state legislative race in #Virginia, Danica Roem (D), who is transgender, beats longtime conservative GOP state Rep. Bob Marshall (R).  She'll be nation's first transgender state legislator.
Ralph Northam slightly extending his lead in Virginia.  With 67% of the vote in, it's Northam 52, Gillespie 47.
First female mayor of Manchester, NH in history.
Democrats win mayor's race in Manchester, N.H. for the first time in 12 years.  Joyce Craig (D) knocks off GOP Mayor Ted Gatsas.
No surprise in #NJGovRace:  Phil Murphy (D) wins big, succeeds Chris Christie after eight years.
Another Texas House Republican announces he won't seek re-election next year: Ted Poe of the 2nd District.  That makes four so far (also Jeb Hensarling, Sam Johnson and Lamar Smith).
With 41% of the vote counted in #VAGovRace, it's Northam (D) 51, Gillespie (R) 48.
If #EdGillespie wins #VAGovRace, the Bannon wing of the GOP will say it's because he moved to the right; if he loses, he didn't move enough.
Sad to learn that #RoyHalladay, the great former pitcher for the Blue Jays/Phillies, has died in a plane crash in the Gulf of Mexico.
@Louisville_rule Yeah, I'll adjust the chart.  He was all but running until he said he was ending his campaign for governor.  But he never "announced."
@Louisville_rule Check out the chart!
In the past 60 years, every lt. gov. in #Virginia has later run for governor.  How did they do?  https://t.co/WXr4PL7gXv

@TheDashedLine Right now, I'd bet against it, though MD is such a heavy Democratic state.  No GOP governor has been reelected there since 1954.
Rep. Dave Reichert (R-Wash.), always a top Dem target though he always manages to survive, announces he's retiring in 2018; Dem pickup?

@zefirotorna Dems think their candidate can beat Roy Moore in the December general election; I'm not so sure.
It's a 9/26 GOP runoff in #ALSenate between Roy Moore and interim Sen. Luther Strange, who was backed by Trump &amp; McConnell.
@nyygirl333 I was born in the Bronx.  I wouldn't have it any other way.
Hey Girardi, keep putting in Chapman as the closer in the 9th inning, said no #Yankees fan ever.
Keep putting in Chapman, Joe.  When are you going to start paying attention???? https://t.co/alHptxwxGK
In GOP #ALSEN primary, w/56% counted, it's as expected: Roy Moore 41%, Luther Strange 31%, Mo Brooks 20%.  Doug Jones wins Dem primary.

Senate had a healthcare repeal vote tonight. It needed 60 votes but got only 43. 9 Rs voted no. McCain, moving speech and all, voted yes.
To all on this page who expressed opposition to McCain's vote (and my comments), I appreciate the civility in how you stated your views.
McCain says health care in this country is too important not to debate, calls for both parties to write bill. This is an important speech.
#JohnMcCain, in Senate floor speech, castigates both parties for lack of deliberation, argues that health care bill deserves a full debate.
@IamNikoGuardia Not that uncommon.
Heartwarming to see #JohnMcCain healthy enough to show up for vote. Distressing to see him vote on bill that could deny millions coverage.
GOP healthcare bill lives on for now; McCain votes YES to begin debate.  Can't ignore the irony of a vote that could deny millions coverage.
John McCain on Senate floor.
I hear every response to my last tweet on McCain.  I use "heartwarming" to see that he's up and about.  Not about the vote that's to come.
Remarkable and heartwarming (and astonishing, to be honest) to see #JohnMcCain return to DC for health care bill vote.
Vote 2 begin debate on healthcare bill is underway.  McConnell needs 50+.  2Rs, Murkowski &amp; Collins, have voted no. GOP can't afford another
@thathaastu1 @5280high @ReaderAdrift @jrovner @kairyssdal @tamarakeithNPR @nprAudie @NickKristof It shows excellent taste on your part.

It took courage for Larry Hogan Sr. to call for Nixon's impeachment in 1974, but it also cost him the GOP nomination for Maryland governor.
Larry Hogan Sr., the father of MD Gov. Larry Hogan, who was one of the first GOP House members to call for Nixon's impeachment, dead at 88.
I love playoff hockey and I love OT playoff hockey.  But when it's the #Rangers, I'm a nervous wreck.

This button is the answer to last week's Political Junkie trivia question.  To see the question, go to https://t.co/vVRCnTtHRv https://t.co/3JUOcTNyJl
For me, it was never about ideology.  It was always about pleasantry, and civility.  https://t.co/CcnJ7aLr1G
@lawless523 Yes, but the harassment charges have been going on forever.  Seems like action was only taken when it was about the advertising dollars.
Bill O'Reilly is out at Fox News.  Was it because of sexual harassment charges or advertising boycotts?  https://t.co/7a9PDZsvd6
... having said that, Ossoff coming thisclose to winning #GA06 outright was not what the GOP wanted to see. Last time Dems won the CD: 1976.
There are lots of interpretations as to what happened in #GA06 &amp; what it means. I would hold off &amp; wait for the results of the 6/20 runoff.
It's a June 20 runoff in #GA06.  Ossoff (D) had huge lead vs. split GOP field but finished with 48% of vote. Total R votes topped D votes.
@mario46_2 No, they wouldn't have done that; GA legislature was still overwhelmingly Democratic.  Flynt retired in '78 and Newt won on his 3rd try.
84% of the vote counted and, for the first time, Ossoff (D) has less than a majority: 48.6%
Last Democratic victory in #GA06 (which of course has been redrawn over the years) was in 1976: John Flynt 52%, Newt Gingrich 48%.
Prediction:  In #GA06, Democrat Jon Ossoff will see his shadow and we'll have 9 more weeks of campaigning.
54% counted in #GA06 and Jon Ossoff's (D) lead in the 18-candidate race is down to 50.3%.  If he gets 50% + 1 he wins the seat outright.
@thathaastu1 State election law. Some states have it 2 weeks later. Georgia 2 months later.
@UNAVoterNC Yikes.
With 46% of the vote from #GA06 in, Jon Ossoff's (D) lead is down to 51%.  The guess is he'll be pulled under 50%, and thus a 6/20 runoff.
It's early, I know.  But the possibility of Ossoff winning in the Republican #GA06, campaigning on the fact that John Lewis endorsed him?
@arnielayne Ooo, I like that question.  When Wofford won in '91, PA hadn't elected a Dem to the Senate since 1962.
Sorry, those were old numbers.  With 23% counted in #GA06, it's Ossoff (D) with 56%, Handel (R) 16%.
Hard to tell how much of the vote has been counted in #GA06 -- maybe less than 10%.  But right now it's Ossoff (D) with 58%, Handel (R) 15%.
@PatrickS1591 I believe in every state. Sometimes a state legislature will draw district lines to deliberately exclude a candidate. But they can still run
@PatrickS1591 Law says you don't have to live in the district to represent it in Congress, just in the state.
Did I mention that Jon Ossoff couldn't vote in today's #GA06 election?  He lives just outside the district lines. What if he loses by 1?
Buzz is today's special in #GA06. Expect Jon Ossoff (D) to finish 1st but forced into June runoff w/leading R. But what if he gets 50%? Wow.
Polls in today's special in #GA06 close at 7pm ET. GOP has held seat since Newt won in '78. Likely: Ossoff (D) 1st but June runoff.

Syria, Spicer and Hitler.  If that's not a reason to tune in, then I. Don't. Know. What.  Thursday on @wunc's @state_of_things, 12:06pm ET.
Was that #SeanSpicer yesterday or Melissa McCarthy? That &amp; other tough questions, today @wccoradio's "John Hines Show," 9:35am CT/10:35am ET
Looks like GOP keeps #KS04. Because it was closer than normal (blame Brownback?), Dems claiming victory. But where was DCCC? They spent zero
@sofiamerajver If anything, Estes -- the state treasurer -- seems to be extending his lead.
Still close in #KS04, but with nearly 3/4 vote in, Ron Estes (R) up 52-46% over James Thompson (D). Trump carried CD by 27 points in 2016.
With 1/2 the vote counted in #KS04 (seat given up by CIA's Pompeo), James Thompson (D) &amp; Ron Estes (R) running neck&amp;neck. Last Dem win: 1992
If #Sean_Spicer has finally outlived his usefulness and is forced out, would the action have the fingerprints of Jared &amp; Ivanka?
Finally, some good news about Hitler: He didn't use chemical weapons or gas on his own people. As per Sean Spicer. https://t.co/vhcnk7zJ53
GOP says it's nervous in today's special #KS04 House seat, the one formerly held by CIA's Pompeo; I wonder. Brownback could be a big factor.

@SaraWilhelmGarb @KerriMPR @annagedstad @MCavert I wouldn't nuance something like that b/c I don't agree with it being called "silly." Again, if I said it, it was a mistake &amp; I apologize.
@SaraWilhelmGarb @KerriMPR @annagedstad @MCavert Can't imagine I would say that because I don't feel that; if I said it it was a mistake.  But I can't say for sure until I hear it. RUsure?
@annagedstad @KerriMPR @MCavert ... you're also ignoring that I clearly said that misogyny played a big part in Clinton's defeat.
@annagedstad @KerriMPR @MCavert If I say that Clinton wasn't likeable, and if I say Trump wasn't likeable, how is that a sexist dog whistle?  Don't polling numbers count?
@MCavert @KerriMPR You have a point, but if you're making the case Clinton was a "likeable" candidate, you're ignoring her high unfavorable polling numbers.
The strike on Syria, the nuclear option in the Senate: Monday @MPRnews at 9:06am CT/10:06am ET &amp; @CapRadioInsight at 9:06am PT/12:06pm ET.

The Gorsuch vote and how it may affect two Senate Democrats up in 2018 -- this week on the Political Junkie.  https://t.co/ZimaFuP7fr
I'm still searching for this button.  Does anyone have one available? https://t.co/dwyqsuTkcR
@Darrell59Parker More important, the Democrats were focusing on the Rehnquist nomination, which was happening at the same time; it helped Scalia get a pass.
@dodgr007 completely.  Plus, the Democrats were focusing more on the Rehnquist nomination, which was happening at the same time.
I know it's apples and oranges, but I can't help marveling at the thought that Antonin Scalia was confirmed in 1986 by a 98-0 Senate vote.
Senate votes 54-45 to confirm #NeilGorsuch to the Supreme Court.  Everyone is pointing fingers ... and bracing for the next Court vacancy.

@BonnieBernstein Thank you for that.  I listen to Simms' critics, filled with hate, and I don't understand it at all.  But I guess everybody's gotta hate.
I think it's more accurate to say that Abe Fortas was stopped by a "conservative" (not a Republican) filibuster in 1968; 24Rs/19Ds voted no.
@YaleHollander yep, sorry.
The 3 Dems who will vote for #Gorsuch -- Manchin (WV), Heitkamp (ND) &amp; Donnelly (IN) -- are all up in 2018 &amp; in states that went for Trump.
The real question: Should a president be allowed to appoint someone to the #SupremeCourt in the first eight years of his tenure?
It's true that Sen. Dianne Feinstein had not announced her decision on #Gorsuch.  But to call her "undecided" was ridiculous from the start.
Uh oh, this could hurt the Knicks' playoff chances. https://t.co/Vkfbf4Tai9
@tanya_renea I'm thinking the opposite ... Dar is trying to pin the assassination (attempt?) of the president-elect on Quinn.
@ginpeck Either way, you pay for it.
@NoahEmmerich  Seriously, you've got to save Oleg Burov.
@alison__wright  Please do whatever you can to help save Oleg Burov.

I think #RachelMaddow made strong case why we need to see Trump tax returns. But what did we learn? That he paid $38M in taxes? He wins.
It was, like every other ending, just beautifully and exquisitely written. #ThisIsUs

My only point is that I think we have a ways 2go before any current prez can be considered great. We need time before making such judgments.
A great president?  No. Almost great?  We'll see. But a very good speech, a speech full of optimism and hope ... when we need it most.
So far, this reminds me EXACTLY the way Eisenhower gave his farewell address in 1961.
President Obama's #farewellAddress.  Analysis Wednesday on @CapRadioInsight with host Beth Ruyak, 9:06am Pacific/12:06pm Eastern.
At least one protester escorted out of the Senate Judiciary Cmte hearing for the nomination of Sen. Jeff Sessions as attorney general.

@ER1CH  If you have an extra one of these, I definitely need it, thanks.
Bids by handful of Dem House members fail to prevent the inevitable: Trump today officially won the Electoral College/presidency, 304-227.

@Happy_Natto  Massie voted for Daniel Webster of Florida (who challenged Ryan last time but today he voted for him)
1 R voted against Ryan for Speaker: Massie (KY). 4 Ds voted against Pelosi for Speaker: Cooper (TN), Kind (WI), Sinema (AZ), Rice (NY).
@AnGaeilgeoir And I'm only saying that if calls made a difference, there would have been a vote on Merrick Garland. I say calls + Trump.
@AnGaeilgeoir  I don't know what we're getting into a fight about.  An asinine move, lots of objections, DT weighed in, GOP backed down.
If Congress was in the business about changing its mind because thousands called to complain, there would have been Merrick Garland hearings
I understand the desire not to give Trump credit 4 House GOP reversal on ethics office. But when's last time they backed down on anything?
@ProdSlash I understand your point. I just don't remember the House GOP ever changing its mind after doing something people objected to.
Since when has the House GOP shifted course when there's a negative public reaction (see "shutdown")?  I think Trump deserves some credit. https://t.co/1Qg3OzIt5I

CNN's Zeleny is talking about how shocked Clinton staff is, how unbelievable the results were. Wolf: "So you could say they were stunned?"
If there's one thing to come away from all of this ... one thing we can all agree on ... is that things will never be the same again.
Donald Trump is elected the nation's 45th president. Hillary Clinton calls him to concede. Has to be greatest upset ever.
Wednesday lineup: @CapRadioInsight (9:06am PT/12:06pm ET), @wunc (12:30pm ET), @kjzzphoenix (11:15am MT/1:15pm ET) &amp; @wearehpr (1:30pm ET)
What do Vladimir Putin, Julian Assange, Corey Lewandowski and David Duke have in common?
@baby7billion It destroys far more than that.
I knew this would happen once the Cubs won the World Series.
Sen. Pat Toomey (R) is re-elected in Pennsylvania, defeating Dem challenger Katie McGinty.
Surprise in Missouri, as Republican Eric Greitens defeats Chris Koster (D) for governor.  Democrat Jay Nixon term limited.
Sheriff Joe Arpaio is defeated in Arizona.
Trump wins Florida, Iowa, Utah, North Carolina.  Still waiting on PA (Clinton lead), Mich (Trump lead but dwindling), Wisc (Trump lead).
What was the lesson of 2012?  That Republicans could never win again if they rely on the white vote. If Trump wins, it proves everyone wrong
Trump wins North Carolina.
Clinton ahead in PA; Trump ahead in MI, WI.
Here's another stunner:  Republican Sen. Ron Johnson holds off ex-Sen. Russ Feingold (D) in Wisconsin.  Dems only +1 as of 11pm Eastern.
Clinton wins Colorado.  She may win Pennsylvania.  Both sides are fretting over Michigan.
What if Trump wins but refuses to accept the results?
Clinton wins Virginia.  It was expected.  But much closer than expected.
Ohio has gone w/the winner in every election going back to 1964.  This year it goes to ... Trump.  Not a surprise. Clinton MUST win MI/PA.
Another status quo result but a big one for the GOP:  North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr is re-elected over Dem challenger Deborah Ross.
My scorecard, done before the weekend, had Trump winning FL &amp; OH. I  had Clinton winning NC, VA, PA, NH and MI. This race is not over yet.
New press release from James Comey:  "Sorry."
OK, how about this scenario?  Some states are too close to call.  Election is sent to Supreme Court, which is deadlocked at 4-4.  Then what?
Maybe tomorrow?  But wow, this is too tense! https://t.co/LotV0hErxs
No surprises in prez states already called; shocker is how close VA, PA, MI, NH are.  So far: Trump (with TX) 138, Clinton (with NY) 104.
Last time Dems lost the state of their VP candidate:  2004, North Carolina (John Edwards).
I know there are a lot of people out there ready to jump out the window ... but I'm thoroughly enjoying this.  No idea what will happen.
