@cmilburn586 @Scotus I‚Äôm not giving one thin dime to Dana or her NRA handlers. If you‚Äôd like to gobble up her propaganda, then be my guest. I wonder about your intelligence. As a LEO, do you think flooding to population w guns will turn out well?
@cmilburn586 ‚ÄúTaking away guns won't reduce homicide‚Äù - yes it will
@cmilburn586 Sorry that you lost friends and colleagues. But plenty of others dead at the hands of guns, that don‚Äôt need to be. Use your head. Make the world a better place for your grand kids
@cmilburn586 Yes. I got that point. Plenty of other people killed that get zero coverage
@cmilburn586 Oh. A meme!  Good point!
@cmilburn586 And so many more people killed that aren‚Äôt LEO. Why do blue lives matter, but no one else?
@cmilburn586 Literally one line about gun violence
@cmilburn586 Yeah, I‚Äôll ‚Äúeducate‚Äù myself lol. Good luck in the war zone in your minds eye
@cmilburn586 Sorry to hear that
@cmilburn586 I don‚Äôt need to carry a gun or wear a badge to know the facts on gun violence
@cmilburn586 Sounds like you moved to a really shitty place
@cmilburn586 Dude, you‚Äôre straight up nuts.  I‚Äôd hate to be so afraid all the time
@cmilburn586 Less guns = less gun violence. Us non-2A people struggle with why this truth is so hard for people to accept
@cmilburn586 @DLoesch Yes freedom of speech. But not freedom from ridicule. You (and Dana) May think you are simply advocating for your rights. But the facts do not support her (or your) position
@cmilburn586 Yes, I know gangs are real. But my point is, they (or ‚Äúradical Islamists‚Äù) are not as dire a situation as you present. In your 50 years in OH law enforcement, how many arrests for either of them?
@cmilburn586 So as an LEO, you think that introducing more guns into the general population is a good idea?
@cmilburn586 I‚Äôm in the liquor business. I get fingerprinted every year. Carry a permit on my person at all times, have to carry insurance at certain amount. And if I mess up-permanently barred from the industry.
@cmilburn586 Registered Republican, living in NJ, you know...one of the original states. We had four residents sign the US Constitution. But sure, pls continue your lecture...
@cmilburn586 Registered Republican. I have my picture w Reagan. I don‚Äôt buy your ‚Äúnarrative ‚Äú bc it‚Äôs bullshit
@cmilburn586 I‚Äôm a registered Republican. And I‚Äôm impervious to your dog-whistle racism. ‚ÄúGang problem‚Äù and ‚Äúradical Islamists‚Äù?  In your corner of OK? Yeah right
@cmilburn586 But not every body does that!!  That‚Äôs part of the problem!  2A people constantly telling us about good guys w guns are there protecting us. But the can‚Äôt even police themselves. Plenty of idiot gun owners out there. How would u handle?
@cmilburn586 Fact: NRA had members of congress put forth legislation that blocked the CDC from doing any kind of study on gun violence in this country. Are you really a LEO?  You don‚Äôt seem up to speed on many of these issues. You do a disservice to the people you‚Äôre sworn to protect
@cmilburn586 @DLoesch So.....in your world they don‚Äôt exist?  Fact is, they‚Äôre more responsible for death and violence in this country than any immigrant
@cmilburn586 @DLoesch I live in NJ. Quite familiar w. Newark. Not the best place. But certainly not over run w MS-13. Your efforts to scare me into racism isn‚Äôt working

@cmilburn586 Irresponsible gun ownership is a danger. Hundreds of stories of non-secured firearms that end up in lethal situations. Plenty of smart, responsible gun owners. Then there‚Äôs idiots that keep a loaded gun in the bedroom, in reach of their 6yr old. What does Dana say about that?
@cmilburn586 I don‚Äôt know. and that‚Äôs part of the problem w the NRA. They have successfully lobbied for legislation that seeks to suppress academic analysis, and shield themselves from scrutiny. Why the lack of transparency?
@charliekirk11 @AOC It‚Äôs sad that you think, because she‚Äôs a woman, that it makes her an easy target. She‚Äôs tougher than you (and you know it!) Your constant tweeting about her brings to mind adolescent boys who kick and pull the hair of girls they‚Äôre smitten with. Pathetic
@cmilburn586 I know plenty of lawful gun owners too. Many are responsible, thoughtful people who would never break the law or put others in danger. But then there are thousands of other, who are not
@cmilburn586 @DLoesch She‚Äôs not simply a gun owner. She‚Äôs a shill for an entire industry that is the root cause of hundreds of thousands of deaths. You, regurgitating her taking points about bogeymen ‚Äúgang members‚Äù, underscores how dangerous her rhetoric is
@RadioFreeTom Jade Helm!!!!
@DLoesch While you‚Äôre making resolutions for the new year, why not make an effort to pick up a conscience or soul?
@GOP @LaraLeaTrump Why are you posting Laura Trump‚Äôs opinion pieces?  What qualifications, and/or insight does the daughter-in-law have? This is borderline propaganda. I‚Äôm glad I left the GOP. You no longer represent ANY intelligent policy
@charliekirk11 @AOC She‚Äôs out of your league dude. Try a MAGA rally. They might be into you. But do the country a favor, and please don‚Äôt breed!
