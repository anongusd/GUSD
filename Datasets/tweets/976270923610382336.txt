@Ronscientistlou @KimmyLou7 @realDonaldTrump ++Viking Fighter++Oh Ronald, you've said it perfectly. Hillary with her secret meetings for selling uranium mined &amp; processed in America &amp; then literally selling it to Russia is, to me, Collusion at it's best, but more like Treason. Spy? Jail? Oh boy. Jail!
@RIAWAHINE @HEINSLERJAN @realDonaldTrump ++Viking Fighter++Wow can the ++Fighter++jump on the wagon? The wagon the wagon the wagon the wagon. How juvenile! Grow the heck up &amp; Leave 45 to do his job! Which he's doing well. Nobody is perfect. If you want perfection, elect Jesus! Dumbass!
@realDonaldTrump ++Viking Fighter++Collusion = Nonsense. Cut out this phoney ass case. Mueller has spent exuberant amounts of taxpayer money just to come up short. Me thinks Mueller is milking simply because he's back to work and collecting a nice PAYCHECK!
@infowars ++Viking Fighter++Oh no kidding? We know that Our ex president was soft on them. isis was never mentioned by name. They were referred to as isil. Leaflets we're dropped on them to evac the vehicles cause the bombings were starting in 15 minutes. Some notice.

@PureMichGirl ++Viking Fighter++P. M. G., My opinion, American's are just plain fed up with the lies. Only dilemma,"Who in God's name is the Honest one"? It is a damned shame , looking for dishonesty takes time away from honest issues. Anyhow, we keep our Republic ALIVE
++Viking Fighter++ O. K. Enough pussy footing around. I've written concerning the ungodly travesty at Benghazi, but left out the names of our hero's.Out of respect. However, I've felt guilty. Chris Stevens Sean Smith Glen Doherty Tyrone Woods. "Stand Down".
++Viking Fighter++this article should stir the American people into  Controlled rage.The order to  Stand Down to our rescue forces most assuredly came from the Commander in Chief, Obama.Think. did he want his fellow radicles killed?https://t.co/e7bWw35h1I
@SEPTA_SOCIAL++Viking Fighter++, For the most part all of the drivers/operators are great. However my complaint has to do with waiting time. The 43 bus wait time is REDICULOUS! There should be no reason for a 55 minute wait at 10:00 o'clock Wednesday morning.

@dr_palazzolo @realDonaldTrump ++Viking Fighter++Dr. Rich, You are not alone in your disappointment of the Demrats. They are disgraceful in their treatment of our duly elected President, Mr. Trump. In every election of past potus' the losing side is told to rally behind the winner. Now?
@PeterAlexander ++Viking Fighter++Chuckle's all well and good J. S.. But how's about some positive results? Answer the chant of our future about the not so distant past crimes of which the U. S. Statute of Limitations has surely NOT run OUT! Justice demands results! Hillary.
@KimDotcom ++Viking Fighter++the thing that becomes clearer every time this thought crosses my mind is,; Why should the need be prevalent for any political party to resort to illegal means? Answer, because the party nominee is simply (Not Adequate) pick better!
++Viking Fighter++ One thing that absolutely amazes me. STAND DOWN Hillary keeps showing up in public! Rich &amp; apparently without fear of prosecution, for the many crimes against AMERICA!
@maggie3408 @HillaryClinton ++Viking Fighter++The Benghazi incident exibiting such deplorable results from less than human excuses for so-called people, scream loudly for justice stiffled. Truman placed verbage as Potus that "The buck stops here"(his job)Obama &amp; Hillary responsible. NO?
@WhiteHouse @POTUS @realDonaldTrump ++Viking Fighter++Sir, It is time that a"STAND"is taken FOR our REPUBLIC. Too much time has expired &amp; way too much patience has been wasted on fools &amp; foolish testing of American resolve. In addition prosecute those that verbalize assassination of YOU!! Time.

@RealNewsX2 ++Viking Fighter++Last tweet had typo in message. Wanted to type, Mr.Trump is a believer in Christ, and is the enemy of Satan. Hence, the reason for all of the hatred biting at his heels. Get my meaning, Can't have that righteousness. Satan.
@RealNewsX2 ++Viking Fighter++Understands why's there is so much hatred towards Donald J.Trump. Needed tons of prayer because in the middle of spiritual warfare. Being thawe'ret a follower of Christ is so prevalent as Trump evil hates good. Simple?

@JudgeJeanine ++Viking Fighter++Judge Jeanine, your opening statements concerning the verbal hate attacks on perhaps the "greatest American President"since G.W.  It's wrong that the commander-in-chief of the most powerful military in the world be publicly abused.
@TheGoodGodAbove ++Viking Fighter++Obviously you are either misinformed or misguided in this https://t.co/ntY5jfNOFA.Trump is not more comfortable as you say, with democratic presidents it is the stupidity that he dislikes.If he see an opportunity with sincerity he'll take it.
