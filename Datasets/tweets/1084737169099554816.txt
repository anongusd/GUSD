@CNN This is the greatest story of karma I've ever heard. The fact your own child is effected is sad and the only way Republicans understand the implementation and implications of their morals/policies.

@LindseyGrahamSC @SpeakerPelosi This is #TrumpShutdown 	The American people do not want the government shut down over the border wall. If you continue, you're no longer representing the people, just yourself. I voted for you because you use to stand up to Trump, now look at you, you're spinless.

@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends You just rejected a third Republican coming forward to end the shutdown. This is your shut down. #ImpeachTheMF
@IamMsTish @realDonaldTrump The best thing about Trump is it once and for all shows that the Republican party uses brainwashed Christians and baby boomers. Which are both dying, good riddance.
@davidkret @realDonaldTrump Thanks for sharing! This is what is great about America, we can all share our ideas and vote accordingly
@realDonaldTrump You do not speak for the majority, polls show this. You're the worst president in history and the last breath of a dying brainwashed generation. The baby boomers will be remembered as the most hated generation and you're the mascot. #ImpeachTheMF
