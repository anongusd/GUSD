@guypbensonon @Claudinho77100 @ABC I have been to NY but that seems crazy that a little girl that cannot stay home alone (based on age) is okay to roam around outside without supervision!

@realDonaldTrump To be honest this looks mean...
@ofthestardust @ABC Right? The headline almost makes it sound like he did nothing wrong. He impregnated a woman who has claimed he touched her inappropriately.
@WayneDupreeShow But I think this is different because it's not a joke? I dunno kids are more immature and don't understand how some things they do are serious.
@AtomicShock2012 @MSNBC I think this is an honest mistake.  She clearly grew up believing and this is something her family believed too
@MSNBC I definitely respect her doing this. I think it shows that she is human and that she realizes when she may have made a mistake.

@almostjingo @NYGovCuomo I really wonder why if it's not a horrible thing that it is confidential and not public record. If a woman Is not ashamed about killing her child then why not hold a memorial and bury the child properly? Instead it's discarded like it never existed. People bury their pets...

@cjozboy @ABC I agree. I would have moved. But thing is not everyone reacts the same when in the moment. People freeze up I would think especially when it's in public.
@WayneDupreeShow I thought he wasn't happy with temporary fixes?
@Von34224301 @BuzzFeedNews Or even aggressive or being threatening and I didn't see any of that.
@Von34224301 @BuzzFeedNews Those kids are ignorant. And I'm not acting like anything. I just see them being immature. Kids don't take things seriously. their brains are under developed! They need to be taught morals in school.  Expelling them doesn't teach them. If they were violent that's different!
@Von34224301 @BuzzFeedNews I'm part of the problem? I said I would have stepped back when the man walked up to me what are you talking about?
@KristineCummins @BuzzFeedNews sorry I understand it's a difficult thing to survive. But I was bullied after I was sexually assaulted by men I worked with. Everyone found out by my boss and ignored me or treated me like I was nobody or if I cried they were not allowed to speak to me or made fun of me.
@KristineCummins @BuzzFeedNews Yeah I know the difference in abuse and I agree. I have been through sexual, emotional, and physical abuse all within a couple years of eachother by multiple men. I now have PTSD and had to go through a mental health facilitie for help. I wanted to die. You don't need to explain
@KristineCummins @BuzzFeedNews What about their parents? they lack proper discipline. My kid would never act that way. I teach him to stand up to bullies and never be a standby.
@KristineCummins @BuzzFeedNews I'll agree the kids are obviously being immature and are not taking it seriously but I don't think they are well educated or something.
@KristineCummins @BuzzFeedNews Sure the kid could have stepped aside? I'm not sure this is "disturbing "? I have seen worse or actually encounter worse just standing there isn't a crime.
@marleighsmom13 @BuzzFeedNews I have seen other videos of this and the man walked up to the kid.
@Von34224301 @BuzzFeedNews What are you going to force the kid to run away or something? He is watching it's a public place. Sure I definitely couldn't stand there with a drum pounding so close to my face and I would probably step backwards when he advanced me but not everyone reacts the same way.
@marleighsmom13 @BuzzFeedNews But he was walked up to... and he just stood there and said nothing. People cannot make facial expressions? 		I already stated that I dislike bullying. But honestly he isn't doing anything (literally)
@hrtablaze I can believe it.
@BuzzFeedNews I do not like bullying but the kid was just standing there. I don't see that as taunting when the man went up to him?
@WalshFreedom 😲😥
@ABC 😢
@officialsylviaj I miss you girl!
@WalshFreedom 😲
@washingtonpost And of course right away she blames it on "Republicans " lol I think it's just people who do mean things like that
@washingtonpost Silence her? I thought it was just something people sent around claiming it to be her. I think if anything it was meant to destroy her reputation.
@Local4News Thank God she was found and is safe now! I really hope that they find  who is responsible if the suspect is not the person who did it.
@BreitbartNews 😥how awful.  I'm so glad they caught then men who did it.

@ehkorth @MissRuth1979 @NBCNews "...and bars police from asking people about their citizenship status."		Um so does that mean cops shouldn't be allowed to ask for anyone's identification then?
@magagary687 @ColoradoGirl2A @SpeakerPelosi @KernUnited Wow! Security and a wall to keep anyone out. Nice safe and secure she is.
@Buffy1939 @thehill He needs to stop with the name calling.  You are going overboard.  I never said anything about trust.  But if president trump says mean things but then is upset about what is said to him? We need a president who is against bullying not being a bully
@nytimes I believe it. And it's atrocious
@thehill The president cannot complain of this behavior if he is not in return being respectful.
@Local4News Sounds like they need to put in a crosswalk. Why is there no crosswalk?!?
@JackRottie @thehill I never said I "don't like her" that's an assumption. I'm sorry you don't understand my response lol 😂
@JackRottie @thehill I'm sure many people would take it literally.... people are easily convinced
@JackRottie @thehill It's to get people to like her by using violent comments
@JackRottie @thehill It's a dumb remark with no consequences and it makes zero sense

@TrumpNewsDaily_ Oh wow that's sick

@ChuckCallesto Did the father ever fill the prescription? Maybe he never gave the medication to the child 😔
@IngrahamAngle @dragonsfire04 I believe it
@NBCNews I think that some people just have good genes
@charliekirk11 @dragonsfire04 The men got away with it.
@charliekirk11 @dragonsfire04 Well instead they won't report the criminal activity to ICE. I know from experience when I reported men who attacked me that were illegals.
@lovingliberals @HuffPost I have a family that is mix on political views. And all women in my family are strong
@LuckeJennifer @BuzzFeedNews Isn't that sad? I wouldn't be surprised.. I have experienced and witnessed how violence towards women is ignored and how dangerous men don't get into trouble for being dangerous!
@lovingliberals @HuffPost Lol but what you are saying isn't the truth
@lovingliberals @HuffPost That's ridiculous
@SeanSpicerFacts @DailyCaller What? Why are you saying that?
@CBSNews The guy pushed his hand away too. That's bad that Kevin Spacey did not stop after that
@ABC Sick
@CNBC Yup cheap labor. Not suprising
@CBSNews That's really sad. Yes something needs to be done about that.
@PeterJ1955 @NBCNews @KevinSpacey Yeah that's a terrible response
@_mwes @megoing @ABC "Stars" 1. should know better to not act in a certain way in public. 2. Know that's a possibility. 3. Protect themselves from being exposed by having self restraint.
@RinoEliassen @megoing @ABC The company/Bar he worked at was serving him drinks while knowing he is under age. If that never happened he wouldn't of been drunk
@RinoEliassen @megoing @ABC At least he admitted he lied. Also employees most of the time (for fear of losing their jobs) will side with the company.
@James_rwnat @ABC I think anyone can be a predator.
@James_rwnat @ABC He could have just wanted to hang out with Kevin Spacey. Does not mean anything more had to happen...
@megoing @ABC The kid has the right to file a report if he feels he was assaulted. all reports need to be investigated. 		he decides to make a video instead of focusing on getting away or telling him NO. That is a weird way to respond when you are being molested
@James_rwnat @ABC He is at his place of work and knows who it was.
@James_rwnat @ABC Anyone can be aggressive
@James_rwnat @ABC So you think he might have been scared?
@James_rwnat @ABC was not too drunk to be able to  snapchat video?
@ABC "while Spacey was touching him, he was texting and communicating with his girlfriend on Snapchat, and even sent her Snapchat video of Spacey groping him, "		What in the world?
@ABC "Spacey plied him with beer and whiskey after meeting him at the Club Car in Nantucket, where he had worked that summer as a busboy..."		Why were they serving to a minor. He worked there and they know he is under age. That also should be looked into in my opinion.
@BuzzFeedNews 😥
@BuzzFeedNews Yeah that toy already looks dangerous period.

@AJEnglish That just is wrong. Keep hands to yourself no matter how you feel. So mean 😠
@CNN Do police pull these over or search? Seems like a new way to transport some illegal things. Because they won't get pulled over.
@SkyNews That's so sad.
@CNN Sooner or later people won't  be blamed for accidents... robots will be? Or the company that makes them? Has anyone thought about the legalities of this thing if no one is driving it?

@SGRTR2233 @CNBC Ohhh. So you think that if someone lied and it didn't happen they would be investigated right? Because liars should be punished right? Making false accusations is definitely bad.
@AnthonyJohnG @CNN I guess they survived?
@CNN Um really?
@cs_hecht @skyred1970 @TeamPelosi @JimmyA_Shook1s What really? That sounds awful 😢
@IgnaciodelaTorr @Dave_catch22 I don't like to see adults acting this way either but it's sending a bad message to children
@IgnaciodelaTorr @Dave_catch22 I don't like to see kids act this way. They don't understand
@IgnaciodelaTorr @Dave_catch22 It makes me feel sad to see this.
@IgnaciodelaTorr @Dave_catch22 Creepy times. I would be standing there like thinking wtf is happening? Even the adults look like kids doing this. It's not even funny in my opinion
@Dave_catch22 @IgnaciodelaTorr Ew... this makes me feel weird to be honest. People touching his butt.
@TomFitton @LanceWRichards1 😲
@abell_elise @TeamPelosi @JimmyA_Shook1s Yeah keep me informed on that
@ABC That was really nice of him to turn it I. I would do the same thing.
@abell_elise @TeamPelosi @JimmyA_Shook1s Yeah my bills will not get paid either because I'm not working. 😟
@abell_elise @TeamPelosi @JimmyA_Shook1s You think you won't get that because of this shutdown? (Not being an ass) but I'm truly curious about your response.
@IWV @EmBeesWeb @jimmykimmel @JimmyKimmelLive He thinks there is something wrong with safety
@nytimes 😟
@JimmyA_Shook1s What do you mean?
@JimmyA_Shook1s Did you see why I said this?
@FarooqmoinMoin @ABC Because of the riots maybe?
@KrochetxKorner @TeamPelosi @JimmyA_Shook1s But before Trump for many years I struggled until I found that job. Now I'm in the union and everything is better but only when I'm working. It's the second best thing to happen and that's after Trump.  But more building will help bring me a job.
@KrochetxKorner @TeamPelosi @JimmyA_Shook1s Things were hard before Trump. I had one job where I could actually make enough to support my kid and myself... but then something bad happened there and I was forced to leave or technically fired.  I lost so much after that and then was diagnosed with PTSD and MDD.
@KrochetxKorner @TeamPelosi @JimmyA_Shook1s Yeah I guess I understand now what you mean.
@KrochetxKorner @TeamPelosi @JimmyA_Shook1s Who said I'm begging or borrowing?
@washingtonpost Ew 🤮
@freep Then when I would cry I would be sent home every time. So really I ended up not making enough money to take care of my son because I wasn't allowed to work if I was crying. It was awful! I feel bad for anyone who has to go through any kind of treatment like that it's disturbing
@freep Even though I reported those men to police. Nothing happened. So basically I feel as though it's not safe to report a crime.  Because if you do no one will do anything about it anyway.  Only you will be hurt afterwards.  How is that safe? How can anyone feel safe coming forward.
@freep 😢😭 I know exactly how she feels! Except I had a boss who backed me into a corner and wouldn't stop advancing me. screaming at me &amp; swearing at me. Scared me so bad I made a police report. he Would make me cry. And humiliated me in front of other staff members. Say mean things
@MarkTheNaughty "...Layoffs occur when a company undergoes restructuring or downsizing or goes out of business. In some cases, a layoff may be temporary, and the employee is rehired when the economy improves ..."
@AJEnglish So thousands of baby fish?
@AJEnglish Those are minnows...
@Local4News If anything I'm surprised there isn't an outrage!
@Local4News 😲   I know men like that. My previous boss told me I was too pretty to be working for him..  when I turned him down he sent me text messages telling me that it would be best for him if we parted ways as in I needed to leave my job. It scared me and worried me.
@cnni Awwww that's really nice of him to do.
@Local4News How sad 😟😢
@cnni Taking jobs I see?
@ABC Oh wow just following the UPS truck and taking packages! I didn't see if he was caught? But I'm glad he was spotted and most likely will be caught!
@CNN Sort of sounds like a bonus? Gets to watch a movie.

Should we make a fuss towards Canada for having a border keeping us out? 🤔 https://t.co/eeCZR4MT6y
@NBCNews Well how about that! 😯
@mkhammer @EmBeesWeb 😯
@LShrug @TheFeltyPerro @doggojones @TalibKweli @Jabbawa78 No I'm saying Canada is more strict 😅
@BHussler @washingtonpost And ask that question to many others.  Most said the same thing
@BHussler @washingtonpost I got to yes. But now for some reason I can't go back to try and understand what you mean by asking me this question?
@BHussler @washingtonpost So what I said wasn't correct? That the headline is 100% accurate? Trump does want racism in schools? Get out of here
@SlenderSherbet @EmBeesWeb This is adorable!
@BHussler @washingtonpost I quoted didn't I?
@TheFeltyPerro @doggojones @TalibKweli @Jabbawa78 You know I wondered about that. Considering I'm basically living at the border.  Going into Canada is harder than coming into the US. Not 100% but I hear their security check takes much longer.
@DamnTrue @TalibKweli @TheFeltyPerro @Jabbawa78 Lol
@ABC That's terrible.
@TeamPelosi @JimmyA_Shook1s I'm not getting paid this season either.  And for unemployment I was offered 150$ a week. I can't live off that! Not like unemployment pays out anyway.  Never once have I gotten the money from unemployment anyway when I filed. 🙄 point is. Why only worried about Gov. Workers?
@CBSNews They should use it for a sexual assault situation. That happens more often
@spaniard888 @thehill Yes that's my son.
@washingtonpost Wow... really it's	 “statistics became more important than the safety of students and teachers.”	If a student is doing something dangerous they need to be disciplined.  End of story! Not let people get away with doing something dangerous because it looks a certain way.
@spaniard888 @thehill Then the hill is starting shit if that's not true
@ABC Why in the world is there a ramp there?
@spaniard888 @thehill It says in the headlines "anti-trump " lol
@spaniard888 @thehill Yup but he did it because he hates not because he wants to help. Its just feeding people who can afford to eat.
@spaniard888 @thehill And this is about the union workers who get laid off jobs. You think its different? Except it's harder for those who work hard labor jobs and get laid off longer and more often.
@thehill Give food to the poor. I'm out of a job and you don't see people making dinners for me.
@SKYRIDER4538 Then right away they blame the repubs. When that would have never happened if those people didn't think it was safe! Those false promises are hurting the people they claim to be helping.
@SKYRIDER4538 Yeah I think it's different when someone isn't promising them something if they come here. Maybe they wouldn't be rushing in for their prizes. They are breaking their legs to climb the wall how bad do the dems feel about calling them over and they disable their bodies?
@nytimes Hadn't it already happened not long ago? Sooo here it goes again?
@BuzzFeedNews 🤮
@MLive Ew. And the father was driving his 15 year old to the teacher who was sleeping with his daughter!!!
@DaniellaAvila18 @ICEgov That's horrible!
@ICEgov @Doodisgirl I was molested by two illegal immigrants in the parking lot where I worked after work by guys I worked with. Police knew but they didn't "hold onto them or call ICE or anything " instead they let them go after asking them questions... I have the videos of it. What happened there?
I truly wish I was not laid off right now. Not working before Christmas is a terrible thing. And the anxiety of possibly ending up on the streets does not get me into the Christmas spirit but fear. I just pray to God that soon my name on that list will be called for a job. 😟

@ABC 1. Get bodycams pronto! 	2. Honestly used the president in your horrendous predicament?	3. Police "do nothing " plenty of times. 	4. The children will be effected by this. So yes there definitely is harm done. 		Patience and talking before manhandling.

😂😂🤣 https://t.co/kbtNYInrxR
@harrygato @NBCNews Yeah exactly
@NBCNews I didn't think it was so horrible to tolerate knowing that the pain would go away anyway sooner or later.
@NBCNews When my wisdom teeth were removed they gave me vicodin.  Took one and got so sick I never took another one in my life. Because of that I have a high tolerance for pain.
@travel_funtu They talked about separation? That would kill them. This story does not seem right at all.
@KassyDillon @EmBeesWeb 😲
@Ocasio2018 Sounds like a threat because you will have power coming up?
@CBSNews I have seen and had been treated worse.

RT @KimberlyBlunk: This is so funny and cute! https://t.co/Q17nnCJcnM
@MMark1985 @NBCNews I was being sarcastic fyi about only poor people shopping there. I'm saying that they should be donating to poor
@MMark1985 @NBCNews I'm union and don't shop at Walmart.  Been that way ever since I was a kid. But i remember it being because Walmart was a bad place and they mistreated their employees
@MMark1985 @NBCNews I guess people who put stuff on layaway are poor then. They can feel that way when they are placing their stuff on layaway.  What if they didn't want their stuff paid for? Or felt they were not worthy of that and it could have gone to someone who needs it more.
@MMark1985 @NBCNews So basically he claims Walmart is a good place because only poor people shop there? There are other places that have layaway
@MMark1985 @NBCNews Not only that people are talking about all the fake news going on . How do we even know its real? The last two articles of people paying off items on layaway both did it for only Walmart.  It's to get people to buy from there
@MMark1985 @NBCNews You don't think companies steal? For all you know this company put that stuff on layaway or replaced the stuff that got paid for. I mean did he personally talk to the people who got the stuff?
@MMark1985 @NBCNews But why Walmart?
@MMark1985 @NBCNews How do you know what was put on layaway?
@Drive_pedia I loved this. How funny and clever
@BBC Had no idea ducks had nests in trees! How adorable 😄
@CBSNews Of course the employer knew
@CBSNews I want to see their pay stubs to see if this is true! I doubt president Trump is even close to having decisions on hiring anyway.  But he should be paying attention to what's going on in his own businesses
@NBCNews Why is everyone only paying for layaway at Walmart? Oh because they want people to buy at Walmart.  How do we even know its true?	Why not give money to organizations that give gifts to children who dont ever get Christmas gifts? 	It's kind but why choose Walmart only?Somthin up🤔
@USATODAY What a crazy woman. I wonder what her reasons were. And she has some negative history there... glad to know its taken seriously. Seemed to me this was handled better than most of the incidents I have seen recently where kids are abused by teachers at school.
@warrant05_tony It's sad to see christianity being spit on in schools. 😥
@warrant05_tony Besides the fact that the principal is completely wrong about why candycanes are shaped that way. Let's question if the principal is fit to run a school with that kind of hatred of specific religions. Sounds dangerous if you ask me 😲
@WalshFreedom Good point
@warrant05_tony @Doodisgirl Principle is insane to think that. Lol what's next the hooks for the ornaments are shaped that way because it's meant to be a J? Hmmmm how do you suppose they stay in the tree? 🤔
@cnni So disgusting. Those poor children.  Just insane how he was capable of getting these kids alone and into his residence.

@Surabees @SebGorka It's amazing how she can hate someone so much. Poor sport. He did not hurt her in any way! She starts the fights and he would still be nice about it. She does not have to like him but my lord act like he doesn't bother you so much.
@abdirxaa @Hislast_queen I would be a little worried about this...
@costareports @PhilipRucker Yeah because he does not start the fights.
@phan1om_ @Hislast_queen Oh wow how hard it must have been for all 6 of them to sit there with smiles on their faces.  I'm sort of glad Obama sat in between Trump and Clinton.  Otherwise Hillary would just lose it.
@aphofer @ENBrown Well there are people who harass for photos.  That's different from asking.
@aphofer @ENBrown Lol
@iLoveUXXL @ENBrown Right? Typically someone asks for a photo of a woman.  Women don't just randomly send a photo to someone who wouldn't want that photo.  Usually it's to someone who asks for it or they have some sort of relationship with.
@BridgetPhetasy Omg that's hilarious.  What's considered a "sexy pic" I would think a nude picture or pictures of your genitals.  I worked with guys who would send random photos of their dick to girls who worked with them. And that was without asking.  It was just bam there's my hot dog.
@BridgetPhetasy @Cernovich I don't understand what you mean about your boyfriend calling you mother?
@BridgetPhetasy @Cernovich For real? That's ridiculous ... unless people think harrassment is "flirting"  because some take it too far and take it to a level of harassment.
@wxyzdetroit Why is it always the same gun? I'm just going to put it out there... these guns are being brought into our country.
@thehill I do think it's a kind thing to do but now because it was Walmart that just skyrocketed their sales. It's a sale tactic
@thehill You know people will start putting stuff on layaway now just to see if someone will pay for it....

@FoxNews If there were reports of him being violent why is he being arrested now and not when it had happened?
@NBCNews I have worked with guys who sent random girl coworkers pictures of their penises. They were upset with it. But I don't think any of them came forward to report it... I know it's true because I received photos too but I just pretended like I didn't receive them. It's not uncommon
@NBCNews Who knows?
@NBCNews But I can see that she might be doing it because she wants to support the other claim.
@NBCNews Lol what? Um this is getting so weird. She is traumatized by seeing his you know what?

@IgnaciodelaTorr @iRepCincinnati @thehill Stop saying that. You cannot avoid that the truth is they were both illegal immigrants period. Does not mean all illegals are rapist.
@IgnaciodelaTorr @iRepCincinnati @thehill What I want is justice. You don't know what it's like to not get justice.  They did nothing and I want answers. Both men admitted to what they did to the exact description of the crime scene. I know what happened and they admitted to it. They never were prosecuted

@iRepCincinnati @thehill Does that mean that he does not care about people who are black? Because people are people and Americans are Americans period. Does not matter what you look like.

@ABC That's cute. But it's not going to stop them from deporting that person.
@kaitlancollins @PhilipRucker Why? So he can continue to do things that we don't know about with OUR country?
@ce06799 @JimmyA_Shook1s @SteveSchmidtSES @TheBeatWithAri The media needs to show the people the truth and warn people. Not keep things from getting out. That's the problem I think. Is they need to stop holding back
@ce06799 @JimmyA_Shook1s @SteveSchmidtSES @TheBeatWithAri When he tells us not to believe something that's not going to get anyone to stop watching the news... he needs to prove that the media is lying not just say it. 		He is wrong. The media is not lying to the people. Maybe they are choosy about what they show but do not lie.
@kicknit23 @CattHarmony @PatrioticVa A lot of the attacks and harm is coming from the left because they don't like the president.
@kicknit23 @CattHarmony @PatrioticVa I am not sure you understand what I mean. Yeah there is no hurt done when you are defending something you truly believe is worth defending. I mean that I could never attack and harm someone just because I don't like them.
@kicknit23 @CattHarmony @PatrioticVa That is a good point. They are being dangerous and don't seem to mind that. I know I hold my ground as much as I can. But I could never do anything to hurt someone else even if I didn't like them.
Had a asbestos and lead awareness course today at the union hall... found out how our POTUS does not care to regulate asbestos? Um what?!?!	President Trump that stuff needs to be regulated! asbestos kills and is dangerous to families and workers like me and others in my family 😠
@LauraLoomer Wait who are we blaming for this girls death?
@CattHarmony @PatrioticVa I really don't think being smart is the issue we are all having... Democrats are not stupid. They are angry. Same for Republicans. Most Republicans have no guts. At least Democrats go out there and try... I give them that. There are pros and cons on both sides.
@CattHarmony @PatrioticVa Really?
@Local4News I love when something like this gets harsh punishment.  But attempted rape and sexual assault gets nothing close. 😡😠

@JudgeTedPoe These men never had to pay for what they did. They even let one of the men off of any kind of charges when he had assaulted other women and at least one other woman made a police report I was with her!
@JudgeTedPoe I wish I could get this kind of help. Or at least could have gotten the help I needed. I cannot get over what has happened to me. Mainly because there was no justice for myself and others. It's in my mind every day. 😔
@PrisonPlanet @PatriotTrumps What a jerk
@Fox4Weather Oh man.... ☹
@_POTUSTRUMPNEWS He also used the "F" word multiple times while screaming at me. It was terrifying
@_POTUSTRUMPNEWS I know it was on video at my work but I'm sure this police did not go there to check.
@_POTUSTRUMPNEWS I thought I was going to be hit by him. I covered my head and screamed so loud in complete fear until he walked away while i sat there for  minute and ran outside. I went to the police.... they told me to never go back to my job again.
@_POTUSTRUMPNEWS I know exactly how that feels. But it was way worse than that. Backed me into a corner and said "go outside or go to the bathroom " over and over and over again. I froze up and began to shake and cry and told him to back away from me but he kept coming for me.
@SebGorka @WhoopiGoldberg @JudgeJeanine She can get in trouble for doing that.  Oh my goodness that's so unbelievably crazy of her

@PatriotTrumps I will point out things that Trump does that bothers me. But does not mean I hate him. It just means he is not perfect. Not that anyone is. I have family who are on both sides. Mom is Blue dad is Red. I can see where they both have their views and I'm basically in the middle

@mitchellvii I'm not saying we should hate them or go crazy. But we shouldn't trust that kind of behavior. Makes it seem like we accept that behavior
@mitchellvii I just think that Trump should not trust someone who is dishonest.  People who do shady things should be watched and looked into not praised or released of suspicion and basically allowed to carry on with wrongdoing.  It's making the US look like a bitch and like cowards or weak

@idk99989 @thehill I just read the headline. I'm so annoyed with these stories. These companies are so soft. And then hard on their own people. Some make mistakes but to be honest the employees should leave the police calling to their boss then. 🙄. Does not matter I gave that option to my boss too

@tchoppo23 @sleepin_beautii And I just know from experience what money can do to people. The abuse of power and how far people would go to destroy someone with that power.
@tchoppo23 @sleepin_beautii Problem with PTSD unfortunately. I'm sorry I wasn't trying to make you upset. Just wanted to understand is all.
@tchoppo23 @sleepin_beautii That is even more scary to think about money as gain to power. 😰. People can get away with a lot when they have money and use it to control whatever and whoever. Just like with businesses. Some cover up so much with their money. It's so wrong.

@tchoppo23 @sleepin_beautii I want to survive. And that's a means for survival. So I guess that's how I see it 😊
@tchoppo23 @sleepin_beautii I used to like money more than I do now... took a lot for me to gain courage to go back to work. So basically I'm working to challenge myself more than anything.

@mitchellreports @DrVMDS This information i have is about illegal criminals who are a danger to society.
@mitchellreports @DrVMDS I was basically separated from my child and I did nothing wrong... it was because I was in danger of my life. I could still possibly be but that is because no one has gotten in trouble for what they did to me and what information I have on them that they wouldn't want to get out
I have been thinking that a lot of people don't understand what "cruel" really is like... 	America is not evil. We don't kill people who are illegally entering into our country. But in other countries they don't mess around. If that was pulled you are as good as dead.

@CeciliaRaville @brianstelter @SteveDoocy @foxandfriends Okay I take back the "stop saying " because you can say whatever you want but its incorrect
@CeciliaRaville @brianstelter @SteveDoocy @foxandfriends Obviously the birth of these kids was not documented here so who is to say where they snagged these children from.

@Lextherex4 @BillingsSheila @DutyOfAPatriot @bbusa617 Say what you want. You truly don't get what it is like to suffer. And mental abuse is to basically bully someone or say and do things to instil fear into a person. Make them afraid of you harming them. people kill themselves because they are bullied you don't see that as harmful?
@Mrfward @bbusa617 @DutyOfAPatriot To make them more angry when they have such power over you is not a safe thing to do. But hey figure that out on your own
@Mrfward @bbusa617 @DutyOfAPatriot Really? You see we think differently on this obviously but that is because I have been diagnosed with PTSD and had been getting treatment for the last couple years because I was sexually assaulted and then mentally abused and placed into a state of fear of my life. 	It's no joke
@Lextherex4 @bbusa617 @DutyOfAPatriot Terrorism ring any bells in your mind ? You think  you can threaten people and not get into trouble for it?
@Lextherex4 @bbusa617 @DutyOfAPatriot Inducing fear is a crime. Do you not understand that...
@BillingsSheila @DutyOfAPatriot @Lextherex4 @bbusa617 I do not find that funny at all because you misunderstand what I am saying. That is offensive and rude to people who have been mentally abused
@DutyOfAPatriot @bbusa617 You obviously don't understand what it's like to have PTSD due to fear. Because I know. I have it
@DutyOfAPatriot @bbusa617 Wow but there is such thing as harassment and that would possibly  be bullying. I mean threatening things like your life basically or trying to put you in a state of fear. Not opinions get that fact straight please.
@jayh2800 Awww thank you!
@bbusa617 @DutyOfAPatriot I mean what if someone is being threatening or saying disgusting things to you? Is it wrong to feel like some people are scary and disturb your state of mind? There are some truly horrid people who love to make you fear their words or want to just hurt others. Acceptable?

@londongal_28 @mitchellreports She has over a million followers! And her job is to announce publicly with the media. Her job is to inform the people. If you don't think she is influencing anyone then you are being silly lol
@mitchellreports I just hope that you are not being this way for your career and that you know because you have influence on the people that you will tend to their needs and not your own... you have an obligation to not make things so personal and to give facts and the truth.
@londongal_28 @mitchellreports I don't know much about her... I just came across her account and was shocked that she has such influence on the public and she is spewing assumptions as if they are or have been proven... that what she thinks is true or something.. that is really crazy. Also it's all negative
@londongal_28 @mitchellreports But yes it took me back to high school when I last used "boom" over 10 years ago 🙄
@londongal_28 @mitchellreports Lol all she talks about is our president and how he just makes her so upset everything he does.... that there is nothing he does gives her any hope for our nation.... that he can do nothing right.
@mitchellreports @CarterCenter I don't think you want to know the truth... you don't seem to be open minded to anything or even care to understand anything
@mitchellreports You still hadn't given me a response about what I posted on one of your Twitter feeds...  do you not care about the safety for the people? Do you ignore everything people say on your Twitter account when it comes to something so important?
@mitchellreports Way to gloat? Geez you really do hate our president.... 😞
Today was extremely hot. But it did not stop me! I was told by my boss today that I was doing a good job.  It feels good to be appreciated again. To do my job right and to make my employer happy and to be a part of a crew is truly satisfying. It's hard work but this is worth it.
@jen4trump1 @DutyOfAPatriot It's scary to be treated like you are a terrible person when you have good intentions. How people are being pushed to hate him because he wants to protect our country.
@MAGAKrissy @DutyOfAPatriot Evil is no joke
@MzCohen @Haroldj111 @ChrisMurphyCT Where is your proof?
@ChrisMurphyCT You are sick thinking that way... these children will not be treated poorly. Your assumptions just make me realize you have a childish mind. These kids will not be treated like animals get real! 🙄
@mitchellreports @Yamiche I have more than enough proof (evidence) I was more than willing to put a stop to those sexual predators. I was not the only woman who had made reports to employer and police towards the man the prosecuting attorney let free of any criminal acts when he even admitted to the crime
@mitchellreports @Yamiche If I were you I would rethink your hatred for our president who is doing something to protect Americans, our family and loved ones. What if your daughter was not taken seriously about rape?
@mitchellreports @Yamiche Because they were not treated like criminals I looked like a liar can you imagine how that would feel? When you are doing the right thing? When you are placing yourself in my position where I spoke up!?!? I would think you as a woman would see how dangerous open borders are...
@mitchellreports @Yamiche My case proves corruption, political agenda, "sanctuary cities", and abuse of power! Sound familiar to you? Based on this was just before the presidential election. I was mistreated and blamed. Made out to be a terrible person because I wanted to keep people safe! It's dangerous
@mitchellreports @Yamiche Someone had influenced the police department an outside source.... and possibly the DOJ
@mitchellreports @Yamiche For *
@mitchellreports @Yamiche Explain to me why I had gotten zero justice for their crimes? Can you tell me why the police never arrested these men and even let one guy off fire attempted rape?they admitted to their attacks too... something is wrong with this.
@mitchellreports @Yamiche I was sexually assaulted by two illegal immigrants. I have never been  molested by anyone in my life and just so happens to be two men who are illegals? Tell me that's no coincidence? I worked with these men too.... but they were protected over me explain to me why this happened.
@mitchellreports @jacobsoboroff Why in the world is a 4 year old alone? That wouldn't happen that is illegal for even a parent to leave  4year old alone at home so what makes you think anyone would even allow that? Seems made up to me 🤔

@laurawbush I don't think they should be separated I don't see why we wouldn't just send them back from where they came together again? But it's an extremely complicated situation to deal with as I'm sure you know.
@laurawbush I mean they are putting their children in a dangerous situation and it won't guarantee their safety crossing illegally.
@laurawbush Well how can they prove that they are their children? Or maybe they need to just send them back around with the kids...? I do know how it feels to not be with my child due to safety. Not because I was bad but because I was in danger. I didn't want my son to be in danger too. 😭
@FoxNews The owner is basically saying it's not his problem? I thought that was uncommon but apparently not. How scary
This owner thinks he has no responsibility for this health risk? 	It's disgusting! The wording in this article really gets me freaking out about poor management and  carelessness for those who step into their establishment... owners need to own up. So sad		https://t.co/t4Xw7YfuHz
That's exactly what I said. Without documentation how do we know if they are really their parents and that these kids were not just being used and kidnapped? https://t.co/coq6K7AAv0
I'm finally getting my life back to the way it was before I was tortured and abused.. I still have some ways but it's finally happening. I thank God for  everything and everyone in my life. I thank God for the opportunity to have back what was lost. I will never forget.
Sounds about right... https://t.co/ThTZKoPFTR
Sometimes I feel exactly like Jessica Jones... it is crazy because it's only a TV show and my life is real.
@Jsmooth575 @DLoesch Thank you I appreciate that. It is just odd to me that I subpoenaed and the officer called and said that I didn't have to go and testify?
@DLoesch So I guess even though he was dangerous it did not matter that he had a gun.... I mean I was only a witness to his crimes and I gave the police 15,000$ worth of things that he stole so I'm sure he wanted to hurt me. 😓
@DLoesch I had a PPO against my ex (because he was abusive and tried to kill me) he bonded out but then stole a gun and broke into a home. Was caught and on the news but did not get in trouble for possession while he had a PPO against him? Then was let out again and stole from kohls 🙄
I was given the opportunity to get my life back and I am so grateful. I have overcome so much and I'm looking forward to living a better life. I can honestly say I am happy and cannot wait to keep winning for myself, my supporters,  and most importantly my son.
It was not something I could have done on my own. I felt like my life was over. It was devastating to lose everything I had even my child. But I still fought and still had faith that if I stuck out all the hurt, fear, abuse, and trauma one day I'll be stronger because of it all.
I want to say that I may act tough but because of hope it's helped me battle my diagnosis of PTSD and MDD. The last couple years have been extremely tough for me and I never thought I would get through alive. Without the support of my family and those who have wanted to help me.

@WalshFreedom But what they both said was not in my opinion going to cause great harm to the women they said what they said to. It was immature and obnoxious but not dangerous.
@WalshFreedom Just because I don't like what Samantha or Roseanne said does not mean I would demand they be fired.... if someone is being threatening that would be a different story. It's about how someone act's not about what they say. Sometimes what you say can be harmful.
Samantha's comment was far more damaging. https://t.co/qi06SojhSo
That's a good question.... I think Samantha used it while on the job and Roseanne said it on social media. Roseanne was making a joke about looks and Samantha was obnoxiously making fun of Ivanka as a person. I think samantha's statement was way worse. It was at least rehearsed https://t.co/W5sFqXUpbH

I was so upset I threw up in the parking lot. On the way to be dropped off at home I stayed silent. From then on I know I made the right choice I had that baby and I kept him.

I go to the waiting room where the child's father waited. I said "can I talk to you please?" We go into the hallway I break down "I can't do it I can't do it it looks like a baby"! He tells me "its okay we will do something else there's adoption ". I didn't say another word. https://t.co/3ZleYMrKt8

Kids are less capable of being rational. They are less capable of controlling their emotions. Kids are more capable of being influenced and manipulated. Their minds are fragile. I was bullied but I couldn't hurt other's I stood up to them. I wasn't afraid to stand up to bullies.
My problem I have with working now is being around abuse, or threats without trying to stop it. In my mind I have to speak up about anything that seems to be threatening or dangerous. I cannot tolerate it because when I was traumatized that's what I did. I tolerated the abuse.
And going back to an atmosphere where you have been traumatized is more than difficult. You face your fears every day and you are reminded every day of what happened. It will never go away. Truly your innocence is taken away from you. https://t.co/1r1H91R4rJ

@Ryder1Jeff @JacobAWohl Basically police are trained to act in certain situations. They are told how to react. And they do as they are told because they are put in the line of danger every day they work.
@Ryder1Jeff @JacobAWohl Innocent people die when they don't listen to police officers and either run away, walk towards them when told not to, or possibly do something other than put their hand where they can be seen. I wouldn't wait to be killed because they don't want to be caught.

@AletheaDaniels Don't tell me to stop. I'm looking out for everyone who deserves to be treated fairly. Not just Woman! I know what I'm talking about I don't need to "take a deep breath". You don't know me but your judging me. I don't appreciate you telling me that how I think or feel is wrong
@AletheaDaniels I'm not calling those woman liars. I want Proof that what they are claiming is true. Why have none of those woman said anything before he became POTUS? Why had they not spoken up when he was already a well known person?
@AletheaDaniels What if he was lying when he said "grab them by the '😾'" he may have been bragging. over embellish his  true demeanor. It was most likely locker room talk. now that people have a bad impression they use that as a way to build a case based on that one short modified audio clip.
@AletheaDaniels And your right you don't know. But I am an example to this country maybe even this world that there is a violation of civil rights and or even human rights. That this country is in serious trouble... what happened to me should never happen to anyone
@AletheaDaniels Just because he said something he is capable of doing does not mean he has actually done it. Not unless he was admitting to physically doing it to someone. It's not like a investigator was asking him if he had ever assaulted a woman before.. he didn't lie to an officer of the law
@AletheaDaniels That's your own opinion. I on the other hand prefer to see proof. I want proof if these woman are claiming something. I'm not too sure why anyone would be taken seriously without it. How can someone claim something happened without evidence?
@AletheaDaniels Yeah no I meant it as in it's possible... just trying to keep people open minded... I would want someone to do the same for me. I know what it feels like to be ganged up on. It's devastating when your tortured because your trying to protect others and not just for yourself.

@AletheaDaniels How do you know that this relationship was not in actuality before he met his wife? And what if his agreement with his wife was an open relationship before they became married? I mean it's no one's business what a couples terms are of their relationship. That is between them
@AletheaDaniels I was saying it's possible he was framed. You cannot honestly tell me that it couldn't happen... that's ridiculous to think that 100% of people who accuse someone of something are honest people.
@AletheaDaniels I'm defending the rights of any person. Legally he has the right to defend himself I don't understand what your implying? I have been stripped of my rights, abused, and threatened by far worse and even that person or persons have the right to Due process...
@AletheaDaniels He does have the right to Due process. We can't only go off by what she says... and we also cannot go off only what our president says. Everyone has the right to defend themselves, be investigated fairly, and treated fairly upon allegations. No matter what they are accused of.
@AletheaDaniels I'm not saying that he may not have had this relationship with her.... it could have taken place. I'm pointing out that she might have been seeked out and paid not that she went out of her way to speak about their relationship. He might have not been behind the "hush"

Trump is not only following the conservative policies he is enforcing  them. The long time debates can be argued but nothing will change unless we fight with what we have. For conservatives, this is the opportunity to prove to our country that this president is representing!
@WalshFreedom Yes I agree.

When this law is in effect it will in turn statistically lower the rate of under age sexual activity, under age pregnancies,and lower the rate of multiple sexual partners. This will in turn lower the chances of catching an STD or STI.
God loves all children and God knows all life matters. If you decide to kill God's creation you are to answer to him. Life is so much more important than many seem to understand. Many do not take that into their hearts or minds. We owe it to those babies.
When you decide to have an abortion  you forfeit your right to that child just as if you decided to give your baby up for adoption. It is then someone else's (probably the states) responsibility. The DOJ is legally obligated to provide justice for all human lives.
I'll just go ahead and throw this out there too. ANY parent who aborts their child will be expected to do time in jail. Unless it's a pregnancy that is dangerous for the mother (determined by a proper doctor)
I think that anyone who purposely kills a child should expect the death penalty. 	https://t.co/Jj86hfNjR0

It took me some time to stop blaming myself because I had done everything I believed I could do. I still have not given up trying. There is more to a story
@FoxNews @browardsheriff This man should want to step down if he does not believe that there was nothing he could have done (as it is his duty to put others before himself)
@FoxNews @browardsheriff Who in their right mind would try to justify their reason for failing to protect others lives if they had not tried to do everything they felt they could have done to stop that person from killing innocent people? It seems immoral to not feel like yourself is to blame.
@FoxNews @browardsheriff I understand that he has the right to defend himself as a person. He might have never made a mistake before. But we cannot sit here and say it was purposeful. Unless there is truth behind something so completely horrendous.
As much as I think this kid is correct. I don't believe he should be used to say what should happen to this man. It needs to be handled by the Justic department. Not that his opinion may not be true because it's his experience but that it seems crazy to be placing kids in power. https://t.co/Hmz4Y6gzYg
Does not matter if these kids blame the NRA, the police, or the guns. This just happened to them! And now they are being swung around and pressured to try and understand what went wrong! It's not right at all for them to place the blame. They know what they had seen and feel. https://t.co/pJ6kD4MxcY
@sano_e_salvo @MacMaggies @_Americanmom @JeremiahWJohn @thehill You are right. If he has in the past protected anyone from a person with a gun. You would think that he would be capable of handling that situation properly. Anyone should place themselves in the line of fire to protect an innocent child. You don't need training to do that.
I realized I wanted to become a PO fairly recently. I have reflected my past choices and focused on understanding why I have done what I had done to be who I am today. My experiences have me understanding that I will always want to protect those who cannot protect themselves.
Exactly anyone who is placed for protection and who promis to serve and protect are required to! It's their job and responsibility. They are trained for those certain situations. and understand the laws and duties. they made an oath to protect the lives of ordinary citizens. https://t.co/BEDuyq4bjK

@twitsanon @WalshFreedom Law official's had an opportunity to stop that man from harming anyone! They had enough information to do something about it! This person was a threat to society and so many were at fault but you can't blame something that can't move on its own.
@WalshFreedom I know how scary it is. to know that the law enforcement who are supposed to do their job to protect people from threats and physical harm don't. It as through they foresee the danger but don't care to stop it... they just wait until it's too late.
@WalshFreedom Because that makes sense...
@WalshFreedom @NRA The NRA is protecting our civil rights  ... You can't blame someone who wasn't there or who had no idea or information about something like the school shooting in Florida. Blame the ones who knew about the kid being dangerous but did not take action.
@WalshFreedom @NRA blame is being thrown all over the place. the people responsible for investigating tips would be detectives then they need to share that information with their superiors. And if other officials need to get information like ICE or the FBI then the PD need to give that info

@SimonClaydon @washingtonpost Yeah keep ranting until other join you. It can go back and forth it's the guns or it's the people? It's still a question and not a a fact. Are you speaking for everyone in this country? Because I believe it's multiple factors that drive people to kill with weapons not just guns.
@washingtonpost You can't claim it ONLY happens in America. Our country is not the only place where these movies or games are produced. People are people right? And these games and movies have age restrictions placed for the parent to be the person who decides what their child is exposed to...

@RubiosAmExCard @DanGruiz3 Yeah well I have PTSD and all I see and hear about is my traumas everything the media is covering is basically my past assaults and abuse it's freaky. I can't help but relate to everything not just the 'Right' but I don't agree with the way everything the left does is for trump.

@RubiosAmExCard I have worked with many Hispanic people. I don't believe all are bad. But when this happened twice from the same place of employment three months apart from eachother. It was horrendous and the PD at one point interrogated me! So then ever since that happened they blew me off
@RubiosAmExCard I have a hard time trusting anyone... Because after I reported the men I was treated horribly by my boss and he told my co-workers in a meeting that I wasn't told about. So no one believed me afterwards
@RubiosAmExCard I loved going there. It's really a beautiful place to visit.  My parents sold our timeshare though. So I hadn't gone in some time.

@RubiosAmExCard I'm not an extremist I'm a conservative.
@RubiosAmExCard The problem is not the wall. It's about protection.  I want to be protected. And I want my son to be protected.  Anyone would want that. The PD did not care to do anything about it. But that is because of a deeper problem.  They do what they are told but that needs to change.
@RubiosAmExCard So? Why are you trying to tell me something I have already heard? I was molested by Hispanic men who were illegals. I think the wall is a great idea to keep those criminals out

@anitaburnsalan1 @DanGruiz3 @ABC I was afraid to speak up. I was abused and blamed for everything.  But I realize now that I can't live with the feeling that I let it happen. That If I give up and let go others are in danger of their lives.
@DanGruiz3 @ABC Because my life is threatened by the man who does not want the evidence to get out.  He is worried about himself and not the people in danger. He protected the men and that person was my boss. He used and uses his power and money to his advantage he calls himself "the president"

@DanGruiz3 @ABC Is that your defense? Okay you will see then. That's all you can say? But hey I guess your the one who does not know what I'm talking about. Take a look at the news.  Dems don't care about people.  Look up gaslighting I'm sure your familiar with that term. You do it so well
@DanGruiz3 @ABC I did. But if it's masked you can't use it in statistics.  And its not BS it's the truth. I have tangible evidence and police video of them stating they are illegals and police were not going to report them to ICE
@DanGruiz3 @ABC I was sexually assaulted by two men who were illegals never before by an American citizen. And it happened only three months apart from each other!
@DanGruiz3 @ABC How dare you! You think it was okay for what happened to me? I suffer from PTSD because of the abuses of those crimes. And those crimes were covered up for political gain for Democrats. That is a crime
@ABC That's right! I have a dream that my child will be protected and safe from people who don't care about harming us. He will not endure the suffering I have that was brought on by illegals.
@NBCNews I am worthy of protection!!! I am American.  I was not protected against illegals. Instead they masked the crimes and silenced me for political gain! Hid my trauma I was sexually assaulted by two illegals I worked with at my previous job.
@NBCNews Uh... Joe wants to take down the walls that are protecting us from criminals! I feel like Joe forgets about the American people. that makes me upset considering I was assaulted by illegals who I worked with.  They were protected and I was treated terribly because of their crimes.

@DickyMcgeesacks @JohnKohlman @FoxNews Well I do suffer from PTSD but that has nothing to do with what I'm saying caused that. If my employer never hired them this would have never happened to me. Or happen to anyone else.
@DickyMcgeesacks @JohnKohlman @FoxNews Yeah okay... I have proof of a cover up that's what I'm trying to say. And that the person who is covering up and harboring illegals was my previous employer. I'm in danger of exposing that.
@DickyMcgeesacks @JohnKohlman @FoxNews I don't see why the government would allow a criminal offense (federal offense) just go into the wind and dissapear?
@DickyMcgeesacks @JohnKohlman @FoxNews Because I'm at the point where law enforcement, government,  and even my attorney failed. And if the government is not to blame for this i was lied to by my attorney. But for sure the police and my attorney failed to protect me

I'm told to let go. To forget. I can't let go... Because letting go would be putting others in great danger. I won't allow myself to be a part of that. I will not stand by and watch what happened to me happen to you. I know what can happen if I am forced to shut up!
@WalshFreedom I want to know the truth too. It's so important to know the truth.

@Learnthetruth3 Called now the "PMS march" ... It's turning into a joke 😕
@WalshFreedom I really don't like where this is all headed.  I feel like this is far too large for anyone to be making any assumptions.  Things said by some is ludicrous. And our president shouldn't be making accusations like that causing mass hysteria! ' mad world ' --- we need answers NOW
@ABC Sooo adorable! 😄
@FoxNews 😮
@WalshFreedom Agree
@WalshFreedom We're they close friends? Was it a joke? 🤔
@WalshFreedom Oh sure "fact"? Scary that people believe that. 😕 I want these facts
"...I speak out because I want change, because I don’t believe in hiding the truth. ..."		I'm so relieved this has been Justice for those victims and even if it does not heal them it can be their starting point towards recovering. Beauty in Justice 	https://t.co/ngh8sLmuvr

@realDonaldTrump That's what I say
@WalshFreedom Yeah.. that is terrible 😟
@realDonaldTrump I'm unemployed 😔 I think I have been blacklisted. All because I tried to fight for the safety of fellow co-workers.  It's sad how your reputation can be destroyed because you can't live in silence.  I guess it's just my job to protect oth ers over myself. My downfall 😕
@Learnthetruth3 Really? By who? It's a little creepy
@Eric41937629 @HelmsMedia @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan They seem to know the way to keep me down.
@DonnaWR8 @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan Not really.... sorry but Justic does not always win
@TalbertSwan @HopeRadio1 @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan Whatever you say will have no effect. Your acting like a child
@TalbertSwan @HopeRadio1 @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan Get over yourself.
@TalbertSwan @HopeRadio1 @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan Do you think your cool now that you have said what you feel needed to be said?
Gov.shutdown is just silly
@seanhannity Why are they still spying? While they too are being watched? What are they still being paid?this is out of control. it's already been proven that Fusion GPS was against president Trump from the start. How can their findings be trusted and be considered a proper investigation?
There are businesses that protect illegals. And also are guilty of human trafficking illegals.  They don't protect them for them they protect them for themselves
It's not only California that is guilty of protecting illegals.  There are cities in Michigan that do anything in their power to protect illegal aliens. I know I have witnessed it.
I know on many occasions recently I was not protected or felt protected by police officers
@LindseyGrahamSC They hadn't done much to protect me. But if they have for other people then great. But there are police officers who need to card more about others or remember why they became officers in the first place.
@WhiteHouse I was robbed of my rights as an American. My rights to protect the people 😢😢😢
Don't blame Trump for the false alarm in Hawai'i.  Not unless it happens twice. Then I could see why anyone would hold him somewhat accountable

Just be truthful and sincere. Take it seriously and be respectful to whoever will be questioning you. You are strong and at least you won't be alone. Don't be afraid.  		This is how Trump’s lawyers are probably prepping him for the Mueller showdown https://t.co/pQ44nlKHWu
@WalshFreedom I bet they have. And that's normal.
@realDonaldTrump People need to be more truthful. And people need to wake up! Call it out!
@realDonaldTrump It's dangerous. It's so sensative that lives are at risk. Not only that you hadn't defended yourself. It places our presidents life in danger. It's frightening. It's not a joke.
@jimzdog @jeri_QQ @realDonaldTrump Anyone who is under investigation should worry. Innocent or not. It's a scary thing.
@jeri_QQ @jimzdog @realDonaldTrump Yea I am. My life is in danger

I don't want to hear it I want to see it!!! I want to know. I want to understand. And I want to experience.  I want to the truth.
I won't believe our president is racist  until I see proof. No one should believe it until it's proven true. Or until he has done something to prove he is racist towards black people.
You know what? Nah! Trump is not Racist. Let that go. Anyone who touches those stories looks like an idiot! Yes I Will say that but it's true. Anyone who believes our President is racist and "hates black people" are so naive. Grow up
@WalshFreedom People say things in ways they don't mean. It's about what they do not exactly what they say... unless they are saying it to be abusive
@WalshFreedom Yes you are right. He was disappointed in where these poor people are fleeing from and he wonders why he does not see more people fleeing from other nations... not because he does not think they deserve to live a better life. I think if he did say it wrong he should just say so.
@realDonaldTrump Lol I can just picture the demcras suggesting a sigh so large so it can be seen that says "please don't bring drugs into this country" oh that can work? 🤔
@SavageNation Yeah and that's disgusting 🤢 because how do they think that's going to stop? What would they do to stop those drugs from coming in?
@WalshFreedom Hmmmm I don't know.  Even if he is frustrated he does still know that when he has so many people after him (the world practically) that everything he says and does is watched. They are salivating wolves under a tightrope just waiting for that rabbit to slip off!
@realDonaldTrump You need to protect yourself. You need to probably keep recordings of meetings you have so when you deny something you have the proof. You know that everyone is after you that's scary 😕😯
I don't believe this. 		Donald Trump denounces immigration from 's***hole countries' https://t.co/Jm1uyTnrKH
Keep protecting American citizens.  Keep supporting your values.	Just know I chose you.  	God chose you. @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump This president was appointed by me to keep everyone safe. To protect those who are being treated poorly for doing what is right. I chose him because I could see he valued the same things I did. And because I knew that he would care about a person like me.
@realDonaldTrump Something needs to be done no one should be robbed of their rights or be afraid to fight for others. They should never be forced into silence or forced from their job all because they reported the crime
@realDonaldTrump To the point of fearing for my life. I'm still afraid every day. And I'm afraid that because I was not protected that others will not be protected from the torture of abuse. It's horrible. And to think it wasn't stopped even when everyone knew about it. They ignored my cries
@realDonaldTrump I was then treated in such a terrible manner afterwards I was attacked by my employer who protected them. He tried to make me leave my job but I was determined to keep my job! When I wouldn't leave they did everything possible to get rid of me. Threatening me.
@realDonaldTrump Only one of the men got the lesser charge of aggravated assault and they let the other man off the hook. It was scary to think that they both were practically freed of their crimes. This was attempted rape. Nothing light!
