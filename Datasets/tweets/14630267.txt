@BjaminWood It is insidery. (Tho I tried to explain!) When the top Dems are disagreeing and it starts impacting legislation like it did with Yemen (which was also wonky), it becomes a thing.	Also, it fuels attack ads, which you will see in McAdams district. (Dems did it to Rs in last cycle)
@BjaminWood Basically, before a vote, the minority (GOP) now can pitch a sort of amendment. The minority can do it in good faith to change a legislation to vote on it, but they often do it to try to change the legislation just enough to make it tricky for the majority to vote for it.

When Nancy Pelosi first got to Congress in 1987, there were 12 Democrats and 11 Republican women. 	Now there are 61 Democrats and 23 Republicans, a number that stands to change in November (likely more Democratic women, less Republican women).

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y) had limited comments on the indictments, but warned that the president "better not talk about pardons for Michael Cohen or Paul Manafort tonight, or any time in the near future."
Schumer said the fact that Judge Kavanaugh could not recall almost anything while he was secretary to the president or while he was counsel is why Democrats want to see the documents.
Schumer said Kavanaugh also did not answer his questions on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act	On executive power, Schumer asked if a president could be subpoenaed or called to proved records. “He would not say that the president should comply with a subpoena”
Schumer said his meeting with Kavanaugh was “cordial” and “direct.” 	Asked him if Casey and Roe were correctly decided. Says Kavanaugh “did not say yes.”	Schumer asked Kavanaugh if he’d told the president that Roe was “settled law.” He did not answer.
