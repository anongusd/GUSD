Many of you thought he was a successful businessman because of that fake reality show and because his name appears on buildings. What successful businessman has multiple bankruptcies under his belt? Who loses money on casinos? A failure, that's who.
I literally cannot remember a time when I was not disgusted by Donald Trump. He's a liar, a bigot, a racist and a dishonest businessman and that was all before he ran for political office.
I caught the last 15 minutes or so of Donald Trump's presser. From what I saw, he lied and spoke incoherently. When pressed about border statistics he lied and disparaged reporters with cries of "fake news".		The GOP is allowing this charlatan to destroy our country. Complicit.

I realize that Kellyanne Conway was a pollster and that journalists may have been friendly with her in that role. However, she's now lying for a liar and must be held accountable, former relationships/friendships aside.
It's as if Kellyanne Conway has them under a spell and they have forgotten how to ask followup questions. They're reluctant to cut her off, so they allow her to spew lies. It's frustrating to watch.
When Kellyanne Conway walks away from the White House, will CNN offer her a job?
