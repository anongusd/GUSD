Regardless individual opinions on the wall, this is a moment that transcends partisan politics. I fully support the legislative and judicial effort to counter this egregious executive overreach, and urge my colleagues of all political stripes to join defense of Constitution.
President Trump’s national emergency declaration blatantly disregards our Constitution. If unchecked, it will do great damage to our long-standing system of checks and balances.
Economic development is a top priority in our region, but it does not have to come at the cost of environmental degradation.
Any potential flooding impact of the #Foxconn development on our downstream communities needs to be studied. I'm urging new WI Gov. Tony Evers to re-examine the environmental reviews of the project that his predecessor, Gov. Scott Walker, had waived. https://t.co/4HNBcOrF8o
Contrary to the President’s fear-mongering, I remain confident we can successfully work to secure our border and reform our broken immigration system if we commit to work together across the political divide.
This would blatantly disregard our constitutional system of checks and balances, and set a dangerous precedent. I am committed to working with my colleagues in Congress to counter the President’s overreach if he chooses this route.
I’m glad Congress is acting to fund the government and that President Trump will not impose another needless shutdown. But I’m deeply concerned by reports the President plans to declare a national emergency to build his ill-conceived border wall.

As I have said from day one, the path out of this shutdown is straightforward: re-open the government, pay our federal workers, and then we can have an honest, open debate about the best way to secure our border without using the livelihoods of thousands of families for leverage.

I’m grateful for Secretary Mattis’s service and steady hand at the Department of Defense. For our country’s sake, the Senate must only approve a new Secretary similarly committed to maintaining our leadership abroad and standing up to the President when he’s wrong. https://t.co/ddslbm4aoq
We all share the desire to fully defeat ISIS, end the civil war in Syria, and thwart Iran’s nefarious influence. Unfortunately, the President’s approach will more likely push each of these objectives further out of reach.
I am profoundly concerned by President Trump’s abrupt announcement of a withdrawal of all American forces from Syria—it is premature and leaves our objectives in the region dangerously incomplete. https://t.co/5wGuBRIJKj

The Admin has an obligation to end the sabotage and instead defend the law.  More importantly, I encourage Pres. to work w/ incoming Democratic majority to develop health care solutions that lower cost, improve care, and expand coverage to more Americans. https://t.co/dLRvtocxZW

It is critical that the investigation remain under the supervision of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Congress should also take action to protect the Special Counsel from a politically motivated firing.

This is a sad day for hard-working Americans including teachers, firefighters, police officers, civil servants, and more – good people who serve our public every day. #JANUSvsAFSCME #Janus
Unions helped build our nation’s middle class, but  today’s ruling fits a pattern of attacks to undermine labor and working families, and weaken workers’ right to negotiate for better pay, working conditions, medical benefits, retirement benefits, and paid leave. #UnionStrong
In their decision, the Justices brushed aside more than four decades of legal precedent and denied unions the ability to collect ‘fair share fees’ for the services and benefits they provide to all workers, regardless of union membership. #JANUSvsAFSCME #Janus
Today’s ruling by the Supreme Court is an attack on the right of public sector workers to negotiate for decent pay and workplace protections. #JANUSvsAFSCME #Janus https://t.co/ePIW7DX3l0
Our national debt is on track to reach unprecedented levels, and the recently passed tax law is accelerating the problem. This is a threat to the future we pass on to our children. We must come together to chart a more sustainable course for our budget. https://t.co/VwHRSU9x4R

I support continuing to improve our screening processes for those admitted into the United States, but arbitrarily banning entry from certain Muslim-majority countries and barring refugees fleeing terror is both ineffective and an insult to our national values.

For too long, communities like Zion have been saddled with housing our nation’s stranded nuclear waste while the federal government has failed to meet its legal obligation to find a permanent repository.
Today the House passed my amendment to help communities like Zion forced to house our nation's stranded nuclear waste. It's a step forward, but should be just the start of the federal help they are owed. https://t.co/1NYsr7OOwR

We can’t effectively protect our future elections if we don’t understand the full extent of Russia’s meddling in our past elections, and hold those responsible to account. That's why Special Counsel Mueller's investigation must continue unhindered to completion.
Pres. Trump has shown a disregard for the independence of the Mueller investigation &amp; willingness to undermine its work. This bill would help protect the special counsel and send clear message that Congress will not tolerate a politically-motivated firing. https://t.co/f5H23gHdcU

With this funding battle behind us, it's crucial we urgently address another issue on which there is broad consensus across party lines – protecting #Dreamers in our communities. I implore Speaker Ryan to follow the lead of Senate &amp; allow an open process and vote on a solution.
Congress has relied on irresponsible short-term spending measures that hurt our military and federal agencies for too long. I voted for this imperfect agreement to avert another government shutdown and move Congress beyond this self-defeating cycle. https://t.co/217y8AChQ9

Also no mention of the threat of climate change. President Trump set us on a reckless path with his decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and rollback climate progress of Obama Administration. We need to #ActonClimate
After deadliest year for US mass shootings, there was no mention of commonsense gun safety solutions. The victims and the families who will never be whole again deserve action. #SOTU
Infrastructure is an area we can make bipartisan progress &amp; a difference for our communities. It was number 1 issue I heard from our recent meeting of #IL10 mayors. Important that we not just invest in new projects, but also address massive backlog of deferred maintenance. #SOTU
We need President Trump to back-up his declaration of #opioidcrisis as National Health Emergency with resources to fight back. Members of both parties in the Bipartisan Heroin Task Force are ready to partner with Administration on this task.

It's not enough to expel Bannon, the president must change course, apologize, and unequivocally condemn those spreading hatred and division.
POTUS bears full responsibility for falsely equating white supremacists, racists and anti-Semites with those who stand up to these views.
But let’s be clear, the failure of moral leadership in this Administration runs much deeper than a single advisor.

The United States stands in solidarity with Israel, and with all countries, against cowardly and senseless acts of terrorism.
I strongly condemn today's horrific terrorist attack in Jerusalem and pray for the victims, the injured, and their families.
Congress must focus on building an economy that works for everyone rather than pursuing the very policies that created the Great Recession.
GOP agenda of repealing #ACA with no workable replacement and giving tax breaks to those who need it least jeopardizes our economic future.
Our next Pres. and the GOP Congress are inheriting an economy that continues to improve, and have responsibility to build on this progress.
In December, the economy added 144,000 new jobs and wages grew at the fastest rate since 2009. This makes 75 months in a row of job growth.
This afternoon, I spoke on the House floor about the urgent need to make progress on reducing gun violence. https://t.co/sOdUIqj03M
More Americans in every age group have insurance today because of #ACA. Don't take it away. Improve it so more can benefit.
26 million people will see a return of the annual cap on health care without #ACA. We can't go backwards.
20 million now have insurance due to #ACA. We need to strengthen and improve the law, not rip coverage away from those that need it most.
Inspired by today's meeting w/ @POTUS, motivated to protect the progress of last 8 years, &amp; ready to stand against attempts to repeal #ACA.
It is a true honor to represent #IL10, and I am humbled by the trust the voters placed in me as a voice for our communities in Washington. https://t.co/FvyYmWFusO
