North Central Tx is certainly in the hottest period of the year with 100+ degree days common.  Help keep our community healthy by taking extra precautions while working outside, check on neighbors that may need heat relief and know the symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat stroke.
Good pet owners are responsible for keeping their pets out of harm‚Äôs way during periods of extreme heat.  Make sure your outdoor pet has an adequate source of fresh cool water and a shady place to wait out the heat of the day.  Show them some love and they‚Äôll repay it ten-fold.
Extreme heat inside a closed vehicle can quickly become deadly for children and pets.  When you exit your vehicle, always turn around and look into the back seat to guarantee you are not forgetting a loved one.  That extra couple of seconds might just be a lifesaver.
100+ degree temps will be in store for us again today.  If you work outside, avoid exposure to direct sun, hydrate with water or sport drinks and rest in shady locations often.  Know the symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat stroke.  @KnoWhat2Do.com https://t.co/3imxzOb5jy
Extreme heat can cause muscle cramps.  If you feel painful, involuntary muscle spasms you should hydrate with water, sport drinks or clear juice.  Find a shady place to cool down and gently stretch and massage the affected muscles
