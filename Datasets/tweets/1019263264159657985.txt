@roseann_cannon @HouseGOP @IBDinvestors Gas hasn't risen that much. That's due to the fact the US is totally energy independent now. US labor is more expensive.
@andersoncooper I dare you to watch the oppositions point of view.
@CherylLibby1 @Wait_What_How @GOP I'm a human being.
@trupatriot1944 @Liberals4Guns @GOP Because CNN is always trustworthy and a far leftist should be trusted.
@esta_joy @Wait_What_How @GOP You must have no argument.
@Liberals4Guns @trupatriot1944 @GOP You, sir, have gained yourself a follower.
@trupatriot1944 @Liberals4Guns @GOP Even though NAZIsm is a leftist ideology. 		National Socialist 	80% Tax Rate	Takes away guns	Used a one percent narrative against Jews		If Trump is such a NAZI why is he pro second amendment? You don't want your guns taken away if he's a NAZI.
@PleaseThink1776 @Wait_What_How @GOP Even Democratic Senators admit that your wrong. https://t.co/2JK0jyH3Re
@LadyJane_Grey @Wait_What_How @GOP Calling people names because Democracy didn't give you what you want is really going to win you an argument.

@molnarnj @Wait_What_How @GOP Facts.
@Wait_What_How @GOP Also obviously they wouldn't ask a three-year-olds mom or Dads name but a 12-17-year-old is a different story.
@Wait_What_How @GOP The only way an eighteen-year-old would think there Mom real name is  mom. He or She would have to be mentally disabled.
@Wait_What_How @GOP Being a wise ass gets you nowhere. People call the person who gave birth to them call them mom from respect and the person who sent semen into that women are called Dad. Mom and Dad have real names. Your son calls you mom out of respect.

@Wait_What_How @GOP Continuation | They ask the "parent" what's your child's name they say, Jose, the child says, John. Another example would be these illegals can't answer questions that any Parent or Child would be able to answer if they were a family.
@Wait_What_How @GOP It's hard to reunite families that never existed. Most of the time they pretend to be families so they can gain access to our country faster. When they ask these illegals simple questions they can't answer.
What about how Africans sold their ancestors to slaverly? What about the Arab slave trades? Which where ten times more brutal and lasted longer. They sold whites, blacks, Asians, and even Arabs. It is the West who brought civilization to Africa. https://t.co/dzgX0cIT9b
