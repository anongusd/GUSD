Our Lord! Send amongst them a Messenger of their own (and indeed All√¢h answered their invocation by sending Muhammad Peace be upon him ), who shall recite unto them Your Verses and instruct them in the Book (this Qur'√¢n) and Al-Hikmah (full knowledge of the Isl√¢mic law
Our Lord! And make us submissive unto You and of our offspring a nation submissive unto You, and show us our Man√¢sik (all the ceremonies of pilgrimage - Hajj and 'Umrah), and accept our repentance. Truly, You are the One Who accepts repentance, the Most Merciful.
And (remember) when Ibr√¢him (Abraham) and (his son) Ism√¢'il (Ishmael) were raising the foundations of the House (the Ka'bah at Makkah), (saying), "Our Lord! Accept (this service) from us. Verily! You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knower."
Those (who embraced Isl√¢m from Ban√Æ Israel) to whom We gave the Book [the Taur√¢t (Torah)] [or those (Muhammad's Peace be upon him companions) to whom We have given the Book (the Qur'√¢n)] recite it (i.e. obey its orders and follow its teachings) as it should be recited (i.e. foll
were to follow their (Jews and Christians) desires after what you have received of Knowledge (i.e. the Qur'√¢n), then you would have against All√¢h neither any Wal√Æ (protector or guardian) nor any helper.
Never will the Jews nor the Christians be pleased with you (O Muhammad Peace be upon him ) till you follow their religion. Say: "Verily, the Guidance of All√¢h (i.e. Isl√¢mic Monotheism) that is the (only) Guidance. And if you (O Muhammad Peace be upon him )
Verily, We have sent you (O Muhammad Peace be upon him ) with the truth (Isl√¢m), a bringer of glad tidings (for those who believe in what you brought, that they will enter Paradise) and a warner (for those who disbelieve in what you brought, they will enter the Hell-fire). And
And those who have no knowledge say: "Why does not All√¢h speak to us (face to face) or why does not a sign come to us?" So said the people before them words of similar import. Their hearts are alike, We have indeed made plain the signs for people who believe with certainty.
The Originator of the heavens and the earth. When He decrees a matter, He only says to it : "Be!" - and it is.
And to All√¢h belong the east and the west, so wherever you turn (yourselves or your faces) there is the Face of All√¢h (and He is High above, over His Throne). Surely! All√¢h is All-Sufficient for His creatures' needs, All-Knowing.
For them there is disgrace in this world, and they will have a great torment in the Hereafter.
And who are more unjust than those who forbid that All√¢h's Name be glorified and mentioned much (i.e. prayers and invocations, etc.) in All√¢h's mosques and strive for their ruin? It was not fitting that such should themselves enter them (All√¢h's Mosques) except in fear. For them
The Jews said that the Christians follow nothing (i.e. are not on the right religion); and the Christians said that the Jews follow nothing (i.e. are not on the right religion); though they both recite the Scripture. Like unto their word, said (the pagans) who know not. All√¢h wil
Yes, but whoever submits his face (himself) to All√¢h (i.e. follows All√¢h's Religion of Isl√¢mic Monotheism) and he is a Muhsin then his reward is with his Lord (All√¢h), on such shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. [See Tafsir Ibn Kath√Ær].
And they say, "None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian." These are their own desires. Say (O Muhammad Peace be upon him ), "Produce your proof if you are truthful."
And perform As-Sal√¢t (Iq√¢mat-as-Sal√¢t), and give Zak√¢t, and whatever of good (deeds that All√¢h loves) you send forth for yourselves before you, you shall find it with All√¢h. Certainly, All√¢h is All-Seer of what you do.

Many of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) wish that if they could turn you away as disbelievers after you have believed, out of envy from their ownselves, even after the truth (that Muhammad Peace be upon him is All√¢h's Messenger
Or do you want to ask your Messenger (Muhammad Peace be upon him ) as M√ªsa (Moses) was asked before (i.e. show us openly our Lord?) And he who changes Faith for disbelief, verily, he has gone astray from the Right Way.
Know you not that it is All√¢h to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth? And besides All√¢h you have neither any Wal√Æ (protector or guardian) nor any helper.
Whatever a Verse (revelation) do We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, We bring a better one or similar to it. Know you not that All√¢h is able to do all things

Neither those who disbelieve among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) nor Al-Mushrik√ªn (the idolaters, polytheists, disbelievers in the Oneness of All√¢h, pagans, etc.) like that there should be sent down unto you any good from your Lord. But All√¢h chooses
O you who believe! Say not (to the Messenger Peace be upon him ) R√¢'ina but say Unzurna (make us understand) and hear. And for the disbelievers there is a painful torment. (S

they could not thus harm anyone except by All√¢h's Leave. And they learn that which harms them and profits them not. And indeed they knew that the buyers of it (magic) would have no share in the Hereafter. And how bad indeed was that for which they sold their ownselves, if they
but neither of these two angels taught anyone (such things) till they had said, "We are only for trial, so disbelieve not (by learning this magic from us)." And from these (angels) people learn that by which they cause separation between man and his wife, b
They followed what the Shay√¢tin (devils) gave out (falsely of the magic) in the lifetime of Sulaim√¢n (Solomon). Sulaim√¢n did not disbelieve, but the Shay√¢tin (devils) disbelieved, teaching men magic and such things that came down at Babylon to the two (angels,) H√¢r√ªt and M√¢r√ªt,
And when there came to them a Messenger from All√¢h (i.e. Muhammad Peace be upon him ) confirming what was with them, a party of those who were given the Scripture threw away the Book of All√¢h behind their backs as if they did not know!
Is it not (the case) that every time they make a covenant, some party among them throw it aside? Nay! (the truth) is most of them believe not.
And indeed We have sent down to you manifest Ay√¢t (these Verses of the Qur'√¢n which inform in detail about the news of the Jews and their secret intentions, etc.), and none disbelieve in them but F√¢siq√ªn (those who rebel against All√¢h's Command).
Whoever is an enemy to All√¢h, His Angels, His Messengers, Jibrael (Gabriel) and Mikael (Michael), then verily, All√¢h is an enemy to the disbelievers."
Say (O Muhammad Peace be upon him ): "Whoever is an enemy to Jibrael (Gabriel) (let him die in his fury), for indeed he has brought it (this Qur'√¢n) down to your heart by All√¢h's Permission, confirming what came before it [i.e. the Taur√¢t (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] and
And verily, you will find them (the Jews) the greediest of mankind for life and (even greedier) than those who ascribe partners to All√¢h (and do not believe in Resurrection - Majus, pagans, and idolaters). Everyone of them wishes that he could be given a life of a thousand years.
But they will never long for it because of what their hands have sent before them (i.e. what they have done). And All√¢h is All-Aware of the Z√¢lim√ªn (polytheists and wrong-doers)
Say to (them): "If the home of the Hereafter with All√¢h is indeed for you specially and not for others, of mankind, then long for death if you are truthful."

And when it is said to them (the Jews), "Believe in what All√¢h has sent down," they say, "We believe in what was sent down to us." And they disbelieve in that which came after it, while it is the truth confirming what is with them. Say (O Muhammad Peace be upon him to them): "Why
How bad is that for which they have sold their ownselves, that they should disbelieve in that which All√¢h has revealed (the Qur'√¢n), grudging that All√¢h should reveal of His Grace unto whom He wills of His slaves. So they have drawn on themselves wrath upon wrath. And for the

Those are they who have bought the life of this world at the price of the Hereafter. Their torment shall not be lightened nor shall they be helped.
And they say, "Our hearts are wrapped (i.e. do not hear or understand All√¢h's Word)." Nay, All√¢h has cursed them for their disbelief, so little is that which they believe.
And indeed, We gave M√ªsa (Moses) the Book and followed him up with a succession of Messengers. And We gave 'ƒ™sƒÅ (Jesus), the son of Maryam (Mary), clear signs and supported him with R√ªh-ul-Qudus [Jibrael (Gabriel) A.S.]. Is it that whenever there came to you a Messenger with what
