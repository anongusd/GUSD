@unseen1_unseen The Gods of the Copybook Headings 	by Rudyard Kipling
@unseen1_unseen And that after this is accomplished, and the brave new world begins	When all men are paid for existing and no man must pay for his sins, 	As surely as Water will wet us, as surely as Fire will burn, 	The Gods of the Copybook Headings with terror and slaughter return!
@unseen1_unseen As it will be in the future, it was at the birth of Man	There are only four things certain since Social Progress began. 	That the Dog returns to his Vomit and the Sow returns to her Mire, 	And the burnt Fool's bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the Fire;
@unseen1_unseen That All is not Gold that Glitters, and Two and Two make Four	And the Gods of the Copybook Headings limped up to explain it once more.
@unseen1_unseen Then the Gods of the Market tumbled, and their smooth-tongued wizards withdrew	And the hearts of the meanest were humbled and began to believe it was true
@unseen1_unseen In the Carboniferous Epoch we were promised abundance for all, 	By robbing selected Peter to pay for collective Paul; 	But, though we had plenty of money, there was nothing our money could buy, 	And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: "If you don't work you die."
@unseen1_unseen On the first Feminian Sandstones we were promised the Fuller Life	(Which started by loving our neighbour and ended by loving his wife)	Till our women had no more children and the men lost reason and faith,	And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: "The Wages of Sin is Death."
@unseen1_unseen But when we disarmed They sold us and delivered us bound to our foe,	And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: "Stick to the Devil you know."
@unseen1_unseen When the Cambrian measures were forming, They promised perpetual peace.	They swore, if we gave them our weapons, that the wars of the tribes would cease.
@unseen1_unseen They denied that Wishes were Horses; they denied that a Pig had Wings;	So we worshipped the Gods of the Market Who promised these beautiful things.
@unseen1_unseen With the Hopes that our World is built on they were utterly out of touch,	They denied that the Moon was Stilton; they denied she was even Dutch;
@unseen1_unseen But they always caught up with our progress, and presently word would come	That a tribe had been wiped off its icefield, or the lights had gone out in Rome.
@unseen1_unseen We moved as the Spirit listed. They never altered their pace,	Being neither cloud nor wind-borne like the Gods of the Market Place,
@unseen1_unseen We were living in trees when they met us. They showed us each in turn	That Water would certainly wet us, as Fire would certainly burn:	But we found them lacking in Uplift, Vision and Breadth of Mind,	So we left them to teach the Gorillas while we followed the March of Mankind.
@unseen1_unseen AS I PASS through my incarnations in every age and race,	I make my proper prostrations to the Gods of the Market Place.	Peering through reverent fingers I watch them flourish and fall,	And the Gods of the Copybook Headings, I notice, outlast them all.

‚ÄúThe advancement and diffusion of knowledge is the only guardian of true liberty.‚Äù
So strong is this propensity of mankind to fall into mutual animosities, that where no substantial occasion presents itself, the most frivolous and fanciful distinctions have been sufficient to kindle their unfriendly passions and excite their most violent conflicts.
and rendered them much more disposed to vex and oppress each other than to co-operate for their common good.
or to persons of other descriptions whose fortunes have been interesting to the human passions, have, in turn, divided mankind into parties, inflamed them with mutual animosity,
an attachment to different leaders ambitiously contending for pre-eminence and power;
A zeal for different opinions concerning religion, concerning government, and many other points, as well of speculation as of practice;

Effect on violence ??
@dtks888 @CBSThisMorning @Radomysisky If I am legal to own a gun, I can make a gun, but not a highly restricted firearm like a machine gun. This is federal law. I am legal to make under local and state law, but if I make a handgun I must register it with my local authorities, but not a rifle. Other states differ.
@dtks888 @CBSThisMorning @Radomysisky Yes, no.		USA firearms laws are convoluted in their classifications. In reality I can own machine guns and tanks, but they are very restricted, have long approval times, extra taxes and is a very expensive hobby. 	It is legal to make one "non restricted firearm" a year.

@annealexander70 So sad what lengths our fellow Americans will go to to demonize and dehumanize our fellow Americans		They then justify doing inhumane things to their very neighbors.
