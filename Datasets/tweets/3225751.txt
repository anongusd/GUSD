@MobotyRoboty @SeamusWalsh2 @WalshFreedom And wonder of all wonders... employee ownership correlates with almost every business metric from performance to longevity! Absentee capitalist owners want a profit next quarter. Worker owners want a career in a decade https://t.co/gxgWkuN0fK
@MobotyRoboty @SeamusWalsh2 @WalshFreedom Socialism = workers own the means of production		It’s about ownership. Nothing more. We could incentivize worker ownership through things like ESOPs and never even really change much about how the overall market works.

@chriskritchie @ClareMalone But any move like that would necessarily need a new Apportionment Act and the first expansion of the House in a century. That one is sorely lacking. We've added 8 senators since the last time we added a representative. We used to do it at every census.
@chriskritchie @ClareMalone 9 justices simply isn't enough for a country of 325mm people. Even with all their clerks, there's not time to address everything they should.

@GuinnBonnie @Chuckezz1 @TheDemCoalition @Ocasio2018 Here's a list of terms that are misused often:		Republic - no king		Monarchy - yes king		Autocracy - no votes		Democracy - yes votes		representative democracy (sub-class of democracy) - vote on representatives		direct democracy (sub-class of democracy) - vote directly on laws

@CommonNotSoCom1 @UnrealRonBrown @DCrussana @TomiLahren It's very telling that the same people who support authoritarian politicians also support authoritarian businesses. I don't know what it is about y'all that just WANTS to be ruled so so much, but I'd prefer to have a say in my own life
@CommonNotSoCom1 @UnrealRonBrown @DCrussana @TomiLahren I'd rather not work for some conglomerate on the DOW. I would just like some tax incentives for owners to let workers have say in what they do. Ya know, democracy...
@CommonNotSoCom1 @DCrussana @TomiLahren the company I work for has 50 employees and the stock is not purchasable. More than half of the people in this country work for companies where they have literally no opportunity to have any ownership whatsoever.
@TrulyJuxta @TomiLahren ownership and method of exchange are entirely different things. I understand that this level of nuance is difficult for some people, but it doesnt change facts.
@TrulyJuxta @TomiLahren smh no... capitalism is about capital and who owns it... it's right there in the name for crying out loud!
@CommonNotSoCom1 @DCrussana @TomiLahren I work for my boss, because the workers have no ownership in this country...
@TrulyJuxta @TomiLahren And most of them outperform their absentee-capitalist owned competitors in the market...
@TrulyJuxta @TomiLahren "their definitions always include a free market" because nothing about the workers owning the means of production necessitates a command economy... Farmers co-ops are socialist. So are Credit unions. So are corporations like Publix.
@TomiLahren It's pretty neat when workers have ownership too?

@sukhpr33t @areweidiotsshow @RoKhanna The costs of purchased goods and services should not be hidden in taxes. They should be included in the purchase price.
@sukhpr33t @areweidiotsshow @RoKhanna It means the true cost of whatever you are buying is hidden in your taxes to support the worker who isn't paid enough by their employer and is instead on government assistance. Either you support a livable minimum wage, or you support welfare.
It’s incredibly weak to let cultural differences scare us into closing our borders
@areweidiotsshow @ERVicSli @RoKhanna It's the duty of the company to pay for their expenses (including labor) or go out of business.
@areweidiotsshow @ERVicSli @RoKhanna if companies don't pay people enough to stay off welfare, then everyone else is just subsidizing that company with their tax dollars. I don't eat at McDonalds and I don't want my taxes going to pay for their employees so that you can get a Big Mac for 25 cents cheaper.

@awbw @davidmfaris @Rschooley The fate of our republic will hinge on making the Wyoming Rule into law so our votes count equally. Adding 100+ Reps to the House is even more important than the Courts. An authoritarian minority won't be able to take the presidency and appoint judges in the first place.
@davidmfaris End the court wars by adding 100+ reps to the house so votes aren't weighted against us. Authoritarian minority will never be able to win POTUS &amp; appoint judges in the first place if our votes count equally. The fate of the republic will hinge on making the wyoming rule into law
@davidmfaris @melvillehouse We can still put 10,000 activists in the capitol building sitting on every surface they can find to grind it all to a halt. Chain the doors of the senate shut if we have to. There's no time to wait for milquetoast procedural bullshit.

@TheRightSideGuy @Ikejames101 @ForecasterEnten The Constitution literally says to count "the whole number of persons in each State". For as much as conservatives scream about 2A, they sure do hate the rest of the document...
@TheRightSideGuy @Ikejames101 @ForecasterEnten We used to add Reps at every census and every state admission. We stopped over a hundred years ago, but we've added 200mm people and TWO ENTIRE STATES since then, and it's thrown off the entire balance.
@TheRightSideGuy @Ikejames101 @ForecasterEnten And the representation in Congress is vastly unbalanced among the people... That's the point. Make the people's House represent people equally, leave the Senate alone to represent States equally. The EC survives, but it can no longer elect a President by an authoritarian minority
@JordanLovinger @ForecasterEnten Term limits would require a constitutional amendment. Adding justices, and adding representatives to the house so the people can’t be out-voted by an authoritarian minority because of where they live, both just require normal laws.
@TheRightSideGuy @Ikejames101 @ForecasterEnten People having their votes count equally in the House goes a long way towards fixing the immoral vote weighting of the electoral college.
@Ikejames101 @ForecasterEnten Our republic will live or die on whether we can make the Wyoming Rule into law

Anyone still immigrating illegally despite these changes would almost certainly have something to hide.
It would instantly kill the human smuggling industry across the border, and allow border patrol to focus on actually dangerous criminals, rather than people trying to make better lives for themselves and their families.
Removing the quota system, allowing those without criminal records to enter the United States, and ending the cap on immigration, would encourage non-criminal immigrants to use the legal route.

@FixAmericaNow_ @realDonaldTrump It is always fascinating to me that people will claim America is the greatest country in the world, &amp; also incapable of solving problems where other countries have gotten better results for cheaper… either we are the best &amp; can do anything, or we are not and we can’t. Pick one.
@FixAmericaNow_ @realDonaldTrump You’re already paying for it, you just aren’t getting the benefits you’re paying for. We pay more per person for healthcare than any other developed nation yet rank poorly on every outcome.

@ANTZ_APPA @Bennzstah @coolflorence1 @realDonaldTrump If you’re stockpiling weapons because you wanna do an insurrection, you are stockpiling weapons because you want to violate the constitution.

@ANTZ_APPA @Bennzstah @coolflorence1 @realDonaldTrump There is literally no scenario where armed insurrection is constitutional. If you are saying you need your guns for armed insurrection, then you are saying you need your guns for unconstitutional purposes. This is not a difficult concept.

@SthompsonSusie @adriandt31 @Cara0309 @myview1929 @RepJoeKennedy @POTUS @realDonaldTrump So you can’t name a single person that was filibustering? They adjourned the session every night. That’s not possible to do if someone is filibustering. You don’t get to make up definitions of words that suit your needs.
@sodataminded @JohnWBall2 @SonjaMcDaniel94 @Rinavicoria @adriandt31 @Cara0309 @myview1929 @RepJoeKennedy @POTUS @realDonaldTrump It’s also a well known fact, included in the article provided, that people DO in fact pay in taxes under assumed SS numbers. To the tune of $11bn of which they can never claim any benefits from. It’s wrong, but it certainly doesn’t COST $40bn as claimed

@adriandt31 @Cara0309 @myview1929 @RepJoeKennedy @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Lol yeah right.

@danpfeiffer It’s at least a tiny bit suspicious that the numbers give a BMI of 29.9 when obesity starts at 30.0000000000001. Sounds like a rant wheel topic for @jonlovett
@ComfortablySmug It’s at least a tiny bit suspicious that the numbers give a BMI of 29.9 when obesity starts at 30.0000000000001
@Petirep @missy_zaccaro @jcreechy @realDonaldTrump But a budget resolution is a concurrent act of both houses without the president and therefore only binds congress itself. It’s not an actual law and cannot have any new appropriations.
@Petirep @missy_zaccaro @jcreechy @realDonaldTrump Technically ANY bill could theoretically be passed with a simple majority. The 60 vote threshold is to use cloture and override filibustering.
We’ve added two entire states and two hundred million people since we last increased the size of the House of Representatives. Madison wanted it to be the First Amendment. It’s time for change, for the sake of democracy itself. https://t.co/Qq16R2pie1

@wonkytonkman @jcreechy @realDonaldTrump public pressure works far better to get them to do their job than allowing them more tools to not pay people who need their salaries
@wonkytonkman @jcreechy @realDonaldTrump it's clear they don't care about holding govt worker salaries hostage to get what they want. Allowing them to hold other senators hostage like that would make it even worse. The better solution would be to get rid of the dumb debt ceilings
@wonkytonkman @jcreechy @realDonaldTrump that brings up the issue of whether we are ok with the richest ones holding something hostage while ones with kids in school still need a salary to pay the bills. They aren't all rich, and we don't want only rich people in charge
@conservative_tc @vasiliE76 @jcreechy @realDonaldTrump You can’t claim it’s about qualifications when he very clearly made it about nationality.
@conservative_tc @vasiliE76 @jcreechy @realDonaldTrump If he said “why don’t we have more PhDs instead of shits without degrees”, at least it would just be the standard republican line... but instead he made it clear that anyone from a black country, regardless of qualifications, is worth less to him than the worst white Scandinavian
@jcreechy @justlynell @realDonaldTrump This inability to look at the data and make a reasoned decision without emotion or sunk cost fallacies is the fundamental failing of the tea party and what they have done to the GOP over the past decade.
@jcreechy @justlynell @realDonaldTrump Well the data says that other countries (like Trumpks fav Norway) treat their criminals well and rehabilitate them, so... again, we know what works, but republicans won’t do it.
@jcreechy @justlynell @realDonaldTrump As soon as republicans will shell out some cash for free and automatic IDs for all citizens, democrats will be entirely on board. https://t.co/HTr363s7qh
@vasiliE76 @conservative_tc @jcreechy @realDonaldTrump Yeah when grandma stops getting her Medicare check and the WWII vets can’t visit their memorial because it’s shut down, it becomes a big deal, even for old republican voters.
@jcreechy @justlynell @realDonaldTrump Sounds like a huge opportunity for republicans with their majority, then. But you just can’t seem to get over punishment instead of prosperity.
@jcreechy @justlynell @realDonaldTrump If republicans made them voters instead...
@jcreechy @justlynell @realDonaldTrump Even your saint Reagan granted amnesty to millions who were already here, because that’s cheaper and more productive and more fiscally conservative than insisting on expensive deportation of millions. Prosperity instead of punishment.
@jcreechy @justlynell @realDonaldTrump Then why keep fighting against a path to making them taxpayers? Why do conservatives always prioritize punishment over prosperity? The Puritans are all gone. Their ethos needs to go too.
.@SenBobCorker @SenAlexander we’re looking at you two https://t.co/onEMx0Yv77
@jcreechy @justlynell @realDonaldTrump Again, you can’t talk about qualifications and then base it on nationality
@jcreechy @justlynell @realDonaldTrump You’re putting words into his mouth when he VERY CLEARLY said he didn’t want ANYONE from Haiti or Africa. He didn’t anything at all about qualifications, just nationality.
@jcreechy @justlynell @realDonaldTrump If he said “why don’t we have more PhDs instead of shits without degrees”, at least it would just be the standard republican line... but instead he made it clear that anyone from a black country, regardless of qualifications, is worth less to him than the worst white Scandinavian
@justlynell @jcreechy @realDonaldTrump They don’t care about the fact that black immigrants from places like Nigeria are the most educated ones we get. They just care that they are black. They would rather have the worst Norwegian than a smart black person.
@justlynell @jcreechy @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/DR81milgsx
@jcreechy @vasiliE76 @realDonaldTrump And since Norway is obviously pretty good, why do y’all fight so damn hard against the policies that make them that way?
@jcreechy @vasiliE76 @realDonaldTrump So you’re saying a Haitian phd is worth less than any Norwegian? How long does someone have to go to school to be a Norwegian?
@puresilk55 @realDonaldTrump There was a deal last week. Then he rejected it. It’s all on him.
@jcreechy @vasiliE76 @realDonaldTrump he made it clear that anyone from a black country, regardless of qualifications, is worth less to him than the worst white Scandinavian.
@jcreechy @realDonaldTrump No one thinks ‘illegals’ vote except his stupid voter fraud commission that couldn’t find any voter fraud and was disbanded.
@vasiliE76 @jcreechy @realDonaldTrump They did, last week. Then he rejected it while insulting our allies and showing his racism
@jcreechy @realDonaldTrump Sounds like the dealmaker needs to put up or shut up
