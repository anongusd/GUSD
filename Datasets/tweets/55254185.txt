Despite augmenting our standard mix with calcium chloride, tonight’s very cold temperatures (low around 12) limited melting overnight. Traffic volume is extremely low, as well. Consequently, we do anticipate that primary emergency routes remain slick and snow-covered.
Snow began in earnest just before 1 AM, and quickly blanketed City streets. Second shift responders have been treating primary emergency routes all the way through with salt-sand mix since the storm’s inception.
@fotogeek12 We will alert PW to make sure they’re aware but thanks for letting us know.

First shift snow responders will be placed on standby from 10 AM to 4 PM and will report at 4 PM Saturday. Second shift responders will release first shift responders at midnight.  Stay warm and drive safe!
The forecast for tomorrow includes modest chances of snow beginning 6 PM, followed by a 90% chance of snow.  About four and a half inches of snow is forecast. Temps are projected to hover near freezing over the start of the event, before plummeting to an overnight low around 16.

@Charlies1600 @levihenry Charlies1600, As one of the twelve volunteers who spent the last year listening and studying, on behalf of our fellow citizens, in order to recommend a future-minded solution for performing arts in our community, I can promise you we won't play stupid or lie. - Mary Beth Jarvis
@aircapital27 Thanks for your ideas! We appreciate it!
@NyeAccounting @USWeatherExpert @SuzanneTobias @Nextdoor It doesn't have to be the same site. But if "new" is the way we go, building on City-owned property would be very economical. Consideration needs to be given to ensure the location meets all of the needs of the community.
@levihenry @Charlies1600 What decision did you think had been made, Maximus?
@cinnadude As with any building, materials do have a lifespan. Convention space would need to more than double. 6-9 million dollars would need to be invested to get the roof up to current code.
@jaywalker20 Thanks for the pic! We're enjoying all of the suggestions today!
@cinnadude We've been evaluating the building. The main driving in looking at the building is that the building does not meet standards of conventions or performing arts. The building has been maintained but not updated beyond necessities.
@levihenry @Charlies1600 We can assure you the decision has not been made and we value the variety of citizen input we are receiving! Stay engaged!
@jaywalker20 Keep those ideas coming!

@Charlies1600 @levihenry Also, just in case it helps, the County owns the arena. The stadium was costing about a million to maintain and was built sans re bar, and has needed to be rebuilt regardless. Thankfully, STAR bonds are being utilized to build the stadium.

@levihenry If we decide to build a new performing arts facility, ensuring it is able to be built to last longer than 50 years will be a top consideration.
The roof is beyond its expected lifespan and needs substantial work. Whether we renovate or build new, roof infrastructure needs to be addressed. Estimated costs to bring it up to code are 6-9 million dollars. https://t.co/R3BS3bIoMe
@airbrown79 @ProjectWichita Our apology if we misunderstood. We had nothing to do with the @ProjectWichita survey.  We are the Citizens Committee for the Performing Arts and our survey dealt only with the performing arts. Hope that clears it up!
Some of the challenges with the current building aren't readily seen, including patchy concrete work, eroding stairs, catwalk updates needed and asbestos.  #Century2Future https://t.co/0jHdls03Pd

@bob_weeks @Hammer0090 @ProjectWichita The purpose was to give citizens a way to share their opinions. It was never intended to be scientific. We want to thank everyone who participated.  Out of 4,000 surveys completed, 3,500 of those took the time to leave a comment.
Which is more important to you? Tell us why! #Century2Future
Let's talk money. Which is most important? Renovating, even if it costs more; building new, even if it costs more; or whichever costs less? #Century2Future https://t.co/9qhpxvMcS2
Hypothetical: If Century II is renovated, what would you suggest be done with the rest of the space (about 60%) not needed for performing arts? Second hypothetical: if a new performing arts center is built, what should be done with Century II? Tell us in the comments! https://t.co/M24Z8ZaGzR
Let's get into it! Follow along on #Century2Future.
According to @ProjectWichita, 59% of Wichita residents believe it's "essential"  to "very Important" that we invest in a modern performing arts center.

Thanks to everyone who's weighed in so far! There's still time to share your Community service priorities for our Consolidated Plan. Let us know! #Conplan2019
What are your Housing and Community service priorities for our Consolidated Plan? Let us know! #Conplan2019
@DebA_KS @PassagewaysLtd We source citizen feedback in a variety of ways and appreciate any input we receive. #Conplan2019
@DebA_KS @PassagewaysLtd This forum is to gain input from citizens on our five year community plan to help us prioritize our utilization of our main federal grants. #Conplan2019
@DebA_KS @PassagewaysLtd Thanks for your input! We cannot make private businesses offer to sell or make unsolicited offers on said properties. #Conplan2019. Acquisition and development is available under the CDBG program if the business owner is wiling to participate.
@DebA_KS @PassagewaysLtd We have no jurisdiction over privately owned businesses but if an owner wanted to sell, we would welcome those unsolicited proposals. #ConPlan2019
@DebA_KS @PassagewaysLtd We would love more clarification. What types of improvement are you most interested in seeing? #Conplan2019
@DebA_KS @PassagewaysLtd If the current owner would like to sell it and submit a proposal for using CDBG funds, we would welcome that unsolicited proposal. #Conplan2019
@PassagewaysLtd Good question! We have city staff oversight on the implementation of these grants. A shelter must identify as a "temporary shelter provided to homeless people." #Conplan2019
@PassagewaysLtd Our grant opportunities related to ESG are available online at: https://t.co/Gedpg40Nin
We have a great team of Housing and Community Service experts answering your questions. https://t.co/wzNx15sR3e
@PassagewaysLtd Thanks for your input. We do assist with shelters. We currently provide assistance for seven shelters. #Conplan2019
ESG funds may be used for five program components: street outreach, emergency shelter, homelessness prevention, and rapid re-housing assistance.		#ConPlan2019
3. Help operate these shelters;	4. Provide essential services to shelter residents;	5. Rapidly re-house homeless individuals and families; and	6. Prevent families and individuals from becoming homeless.
How should Wichita use ESG funds? The Emergency Solutions Grants Program provides funding to:	1. Engage homeless individuals and families living on the street;	2. Improve the number and quality of emergency shelters for homeless individuals and families;
How should Wichita Housing and Community Services utilize these funds? 	#ConPlan2019
The HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) provides formula grants that communities use to fund a wide range of activities including building, buying, and/or rehabilitating affordable housing for rent or homeownership/providing direct rental assistance to low-income people.
3. Develop strategies that bring partners and resources together, leveraging funds &amp; building community assets	4. Implement your program effectively, increasing the likelihood of successful projects	What service projects do you want to see expanded using this money? 	#ConPlan2019
The Community Development Block Grant Program can be used in a variety of ways including: 	1. Create transformative impact	2. Improve the lives of all residents, and especially those with low and moderate income levels https://t.co/Ivbu2sPhpX
We want your input on how you think the City of Wichita should use these funds! #ConPlan2019
3.The funding is taken from three entitlement funding streams- the Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG), the HOME Investments Partnerships Program (HOME), and the Emergency Solutions Grant Program (ESG).
2.The plan is helps us to analyze our City’s affordable housing and community development needs and make data-driven, place-based investment decisions.

@BigDaddyCool316 Sorry! We were working on other projects. We just proposed a new plan that would add splash pads and improve pools across the city, including historic McAdams. It's aimed at allowing the largest number of children to swim and play during the summer.
@BigDaddyCool316 As we understand it, there are talks about development in that building. But we have no jurisdiction over private ownership.
@BigDaddyCool316 The city does not develop apartments, but many economic studies have been done showing the need for them. Similar studies show there is more demand for higher rated Triple-A ball, and the stadium will host other sporting, art and community events.
@BigDaddyCool316 That building is not owned by the city, unfortunately.
@BigDaddyCool316 River adjacent improvements continue in the core, including increased paths, landscaping and more. Increased river activities are slated to be installed with the new stadium. river Vista Apartments also just added water craft rentals and WSU moved its rowing team there.

@Brandon06637912 Hey Brandon- thanks for your input. You can see a full list of scheduled street repairs at https://t.co/lP3hQA8LYk.
Includes $97 million for public safety projects; $78 million for street maintenance; $22 million to implement Aquatics Master Plan. #ictbudget18
Capital Improvement Program (CIP) is next. Ten-year program for capital projects. #ictbudget18
Street condition has been modeled based on adjusted funding level. #ictbudget18
Grants and funding for arts and cultural agencies would increase by $115,000 in 2020.  #ictbudget18
Economic development funding would be increased by $50,000 as a new model for funding partners is developed. #ictbudget18
L.W. Clapp Golf Course would remain open until the park master plan for the site is complete. #ictbudget18
Also, CityArts staffing would remain the same while the model is reviewed. #ictbudget18
Under new alternatives, Evergreen and Linwood branch libraries would be retained. #ictbudget18
Alternatives would be funded by reducing street maintenance by $1 million; would still be $1 million higher than 2018. #ictbudget18
Budget was presented July 17. Following stakeholder engagement, alternative proposals are being considered. #ictbudget18
General Fund is balanced at $244 million. Largest revenue types are – property tax at 35%, franchise fees at 20%, and sales tax at 12%.  #ictbudget18

@mikec2w A contractual proposal very similar to what you proposed is being considered as part of the current budget development
@IT_guy8706 Beginning in 2019, contractual street maintenance is expected to be increased from 8 to 10 million annually
