@SBawumia All shall be well
@SBawumia Thanks Second lady, it would have been better as a Muslimah, to help your fellow Muslims receive salaries early before Sallah like the Christmas as to Christians. Hmmm Allah knows best.
Hmmmmm Ghana, Even Salaries Could Not Be Given Early For The Sake Of Eid Adha Like It Happens During Christmas.
@NAkufoAddo Thanks your excellency, but it would have been better if salaries were given to us before Eid like you do when is Christmas. Hmmmmm
