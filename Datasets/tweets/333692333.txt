@byronyork: @RepPaulRyan says Republicans need 'prudence' in coming fights. http://t.co/5XumkVVG
RYAN: We can govern better by governing closer to the people—by strengthening our families and their livelihoods.
RYAN: Our vision rests on vibrant communities and increases social mobility. We have better ideas to combat poverty. http://t.co/FGyqOYnB
RYAN: Our tactics will vary, but our strategy will remain the same. We will promote conservatism at every opportunity. http://t.co/FGyqOYnB
RYAN: Our job is to help prevent a debt crisis. If the president won’t fix our entitlements, then we have to buy time. http://t.co/FGyqOYnB
RYAN: We have to show that—if given the chance—we can govern. http://t.co/FGyqOYnB
RYAN: We won’t play the villain in the president’s morality plays. We have to stay united.
RYAN: The prudent man is like a captain at sea. He doesn’t curse the wind. He uses it—to reach his destination. http://t.co/FGyqOYnB
RYAN: Prudence is our greatest obligation as public servants. http://t.co/FGyqOYnB

RYAN on #MTP: President's debt & tax hikes hurt econ security; rationing hurts health security; deep defense cuts hurt national security
RYAN on #MTP: President refuses to join bipartisan efforts to reform tax code, save health & retirement security programs.
RYAN on #MTP: A budget that never, ever gets to balance is hardly a ‘balanced’ plan.
RYAN on #MTP: We have a debt crisis staring us in the face. President's decision to ignore it will lead to Greek-like austerity.
RYAN on #MTP: Sec Geithner admitted: ‘We don’t have solution, we just don’t like yours.’ Perfectly sums up their utter lack of leadership.
RYAN on #MTP: President’s budget: more debt, more spending, more taxes – no credible solutions.
RYAN on #MTP: President Obama has put forward four budget submissions, ducking the debt threat every time.
RYAN on #MTP: We are offering a very clear, specific reform plan to lift debt & put us on path to prosperity (instead of Greek austerity)
RYAN on #MTP: If we keep kicking the can down road, & fail to face debt-fueled economic crisis ahead - it’s gets ugly like Greece.
RYAN on #MTP: President’s refusal to lead & ducking responsibility threaten our economy, makes us more like Greece.
RYAN on #MTP: On debt threat - White House isn’t even trying to solve the problem. President's budget calls for net spending INCREASE.
RYAN on #MTP: What drives me crazy is Dems' refusal to cut $100B of spending over 10 yrs. They want to spend $47T over 10- why not $46.9T?
RYAN on #MTP: Instead of failed stimulus, let's advance real pro-growth reforms, end the crony capitalism, address drivers of the debt.
RYAN on #MTP: Stimulus spending & temporary tax rebates are very poor substitutes for pro-growth economic policies.
RYAN on #MTP: President Obama’s budget charts a path to debt & decline.  An unserious budget w/ serious consequences.
RYAN on #MTP: We have a debt crisis coming, and President Obama just gave us a budget that fails to tackle these challenges.
