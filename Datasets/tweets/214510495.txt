@NBCNightlyNews @NBCNews @Jim_Jordan  McCain wasn't a war hero? So you agree? But your pathetic President @realDonaldTrump is? Tell that to all those veterans, including me! I want to hear it! Trump is screwed, 2 felonies will stick and he will be in prison with the good man that prosecuted him!
@tiniebeany @Jim_Jordan @realDonaldTrump @Jim_Jordan b@### yo ass! Next interrupt a man when he's talking! Your President Mr Jordan will be going to prison and we will have the last laugh!
@tiniebeany @Jim_Jordan Looks like Cohen barked right up yer tree! @realDonaldTrump never served, so how could he say that John McCain wasn't a hero? He was more a damn man than will ever be! Period! Remember that!
@WhiteHouse You better not trust KIM Jong Un, he is fooling us. Y'all might want to find those 7 currently active missle PADS that he has very well hid! He will never close them. Look a little harder!
@realDonaldTrump Let's see your future schedule Mr President. @WhiteHouse is pissed off at the person that done it, but the American isn't. Let's see what what Mr Honest Abe Trump's schedule really is? By some Cheeseburgers for America Trumpy Wumpy Dump
@Jim_Jordan I know a few secrets of some if those Congress members, some illegal. Some call it skeltons in the closet. We all have some of those don't we? Hah some of those members are shaking in there boots!
@Jim_Jordan But calling somebody that served just I did, that would die for our country, they deserve to rot. I'm a Marine Veteran, and Trump needs to be prosecuted. He's unfaithful on top of it all. The truth shall prevail.
@Jim_Jordan I believe @realDonaldTrump said McCain was not a hero. McCain was a true hero, anymore than that sorry president will ever be. Trump never served , that's as bad as somebody stealing my valor, they should go to prison if it was to me. I prosecuted cowards that steal my valor..➡️
@realDonaldTrump All those fools in Congress, at least half of them is downing @MichaelCohen212 , but how many of those in court are doing illegal things, or have. Who is that yellow tied Mr Rogers looking hobo named Mr Jordan? Let's check out his profile. Shall we? @congressdotgov

@realDonaldTrump @CNN @FoxNews @ABC 	You acted in coordination with and at the direction in steering payments to silence Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, the women claiming they had affairs with Trump before the 2016 election. U have committed 2 felonies sir.
@realDonaldTrump You acted in coordination with and at the direction in steering payments to silence Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, the women claiming they had affairs with Trump before the 2016 election.
@realDonaldTrump Mr President, @MichaelCohen212 does have proof that you committed several illegal things during your election, and you know this is true, that's why you made threats. Guess what, the truth will be known who you really are.
@realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump 	I would never thought I would see the day when people in our political world would criticize, slander and talk about others about anything and everything on frigging social media. What the hell is wrong with people?

@realDonaldTrump Trump DO NOT TRUST KIM JONG UN! Why would u trust a man that requires young school to go watch a public execution by firing squad so it can teach them a valuable lesson. If anything it screws there minds up. There's multiple Nuclear sites that haven't been spotted by satellite.
@realDonaldTrump Do not trust KIM JONG UN, I'm prior Military and have clearance review and can actually tell you that it will play out in the worst way in the future. Don't trust him, there's still 7 more Arsenal's unaccounted for.
@realDonaldTrump Actually Trump, I have just obtained some documents from an Russian Agent that said otherwise. Also I have a phone recording from April 2018, mind you that evidence will enter courtrooms for further review. Tell the truth Trump! There catching up, you have misled the people.

@SpeakerPelosi @RepWalterJones Prayers to the family, I wouldn't be surprised if @realDonaldTrump the presidential hero already said something negative about this good man like he does everyone else!
@TheCullmanTimes Of course, we are a southern state and because of so many over sensative people, our most treasured and beloved historical figures are being taken away. It's not right, and it has nothing to do with the racism we are facing today.
@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/ZN75niGPoG
@CullmanTribune Best judge ever!
@realDonaldTrump We thought u said you de-Nuclearized Kim's army! He is playing you, they have 6 new missiles capable of reaching far inland of the US! U r a big DA! Why r u trusting this demonic individual? He hates our guts! Your gonna get us killed u jackass!
@realDonaldTrump Didn't u say last year that Kim Jong eliminate %100 of his missiles? Yet, why haven't the public been told about 6 new missile sites? U r stupid aren't you? Unlike some, I've served, and I know what this man can do, his dad fooled millions! He will turn on you in a damn minute!
@realDonaldTrump U ought 2 b ashamed of yourself! Have u ever served n military? NO! But I have, and I know what this man is capable of! He's snake in the grass, he will friend you and unexpectedly unfriend u and then he will counter strike!
Well I just ran upon probably one of the most oddest conversations I've ever heard, so I'm sure we have had that happen a time or two, have y'all ever seen a dog turn his head like a robotic parrot after you... https://t.co/rjzCXndZrW

@realDonaldTrump Manafort clearly saw his work for Trump as directly linked to his work for pro-Russian forces!!!! Do I need to keep going! Somebody blew the whistle!! Oopsy!
@realDonaldTrump that there was Russia-related wrongdoing that is being covered up. And it’s striking that we continue to learn new things about contacts between Trump and Russia
@realDonaldTrump Russian government doesn’t demonstrate that either actually occurred. But it’s unquestionably evidence in favor of the possibility. The fact that all of this was lied about and swept under the rug is further evidence
@realDonaldTrump And, of course, Trump Jr., along with Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort, attended the infamous Trump Tower meeting whose purpose was explicitly described as “part of Russia and its support for Mr Trump” and was said to involve incriminating information about Hillary Clinton
@realDonaldTrump And, of course, Trump Jr., along with Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort, attended the infamous Trump Tower meeting whose purpose was explicitly described as “part of Russia and its support for Mr Trump” and was said to involve incriminating information about Hillary Clinton
@psstricia @realDonaldTrump The meeting was arranged by a US conservative activist named Paul Erickson, who got in touch with senior Trump campaign aide Rick Dearborn to set it up, explicitly as a step toward creating back-channel communications between Russia and the campaign.
@realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @CNN		The meeting was arranged by a US conservative activist named Paul Erickson, who got in touch with senior Trump campaign aide Rick Dearborn to set it up, explicitly as a step toward creating back-channel communications between Russia and the campaign.
@realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @CNN 	 some of it was quite high-level and explicitly about the campaign. Donald Trump Jr., for example, took a meeting with the deputy governor of Russia’s central bank while attending the National Rifle Association’s annual convention in Kentucky in May 2016
@realDonaldTrump In reality, as exhaustively documented by the Moscow Project, there were extensive communications between people in Trump’s orbit and Russian government figures or others who had, or purported to have, close ties to the Putin regime. COLLUSION!
@realDonaldTrump In reality, as exhaustively documented by the Moscow Project, there were extensive communications between people in Trump’s orbit and Russian government figures or others who had, or purported to have, close ties to the Putin regime.
@realDonaldTrump Why was you on same level coordinating your campaign messaging with the Russian hackers, and that you was taking a pro-Putin line in exchange for Russian help and you sincerely believed in the pro-Putin line and therefore saw nothing wrong with accepting Russian assistance.
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Explain this Trump: 	Why did u spend the 2016 campaign running an overtly pro-Russian campaign message, praising Vladimir Putin’s leadership, defending him from allegations of murdering his political opponents, and calling for a realignment of US strategy in Syria and Ukraine?
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Explain this Trump: 	Why did u spend the 2016 campaign running an overtly pro-Russian campaign message, praising Vladimir Putin’s leadership, defending him from allegations of murdering his political opponents, and calling for a realignment of US strategy in Syria and Ukraine?

@psstricia @realDonaldTrump Here's the BIG ONE: 	Trump also spent the 2016 campaign running an overtly pro-Russian campaign message, praising Vladimir Putin’s leadership, defending him from allegations of murdering his political opponents, and calling for a realignment of US strategy in Syria and Ukraine
@psstricia @realDonaldTrump Proof 2 These emails were not immediately released, and they were not released by the hackers who obtained them. Instead, the emails were disseminated to the public by using Julian Assange and WikiLeaks as an intermediary.
@psstricia @realDonaldTrump believed to have been agents operating on behalf of the Russian government.
@psstricia @realDonaldTrump Proof 1 Two separate hacks of Democratic Party emails, one purloining a trove of internal Democratic National Committee emails and one that stole a ton of correspondence from John Podesta’s personal Gmail account — were perpetrated over the course of 2016, by what are now -----
@realDonaldTrump Both the contacts that have been revealed so far and the deception used to deny their existence are certainly evidence of collusion , evidence that should be(and is being)pursued by the special counsel’s office and that should not be dismissed by the press or by elected officials
@realDonaldTrump By the same token, it’s certainly possible that the various Trump-Russia contacts never amounted to anything and that they’ve been consistently covered up for some reason other than an effort to hide collusion
@realDonaldTrump It’s important, obviously, not to prejudge a case. It turns out that Saddam Hussein was acting like a man who was covering up a secret nuclear weapons arsenal because he didn’t want the world to know how weak his defenses really were. Just as is in this collusion game!
@realDonaldTrump Hey Mr President, we are investigating you and your foreign businesses and certain accounts. And you might be more than shocked after what we just found out about those policies!!
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump We need god in our schools, we need prayers and just god in there! Screw those pathetic unbelievers, put prayers back n our schools! If there is anyone that is against that, 2 words 4 ya!!! Screw You and the pony u rode in on! Buttercups!!!!

@MarkWarner It's just a damn social media, I bet if it wasn't making billions, nobody would want in on Facebook. Too many losers that eat and sleep money.....well they can take that money and cram it up there @$$!
@MarkWarner Yeah well his sorry ass needs to be impeached! Embarrassing times for America! He's nothing but a bold face unfaithful liar...he's told so many lies hell he can't keep up with it! Just like all those rich pricks that order a big rich man named Mark Zuckerberg to court.....
@realDonaldTrump I wish @WhiteHouse @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP @SenateGOP would leave @facebook @markzuckkchs16 the hell alone. Don't you losers have anything else to do besides ordering someone to court! Only reason because of all the money, alot of pill heads in that house huh?
@realDonaldTrump Harrassing??? Really??? What are you gonna do, have us lined up and killed? I already have your men following me! Stop playing the victim sweetheart, suck it up buttercup!
@realDonaldTrump Ummm last time I checked, you was the one harrassing and calling names, u know Ms Pocahontas??? It's a disgrace and your nonfit to b president! You don't know shit about our military!
@realDonaldTrump Hey you titty, remember those 8 big white house administrators that was with you last year, guess what dummy, there no longer with you! These good people have been working in the WH for over  25 years, you come along, they all quit! Kinda embarrassing Mr Not My President! Enjoy!
@realDonaldTrump Hey sweetheart, you lost my trust when u promised Americans u would show us ur taxes, and promised us that Mexico would pay for the wall! So, WHOS THE LIAR NOW? What else are you hiding sweet pea? Let's see it!
@realDonaldTrump That was the cold hardest, dissociative, driest speech I've ever heard! He hates woman, enjoys calling them names, as bad as he enjoys calling his own wife bitch 20x a day!
@realDonaldTrump @rushlimbaugh commerical just said a new poll said more Americans approved of his words, more than the #FakeNews! No! Newsflash, that was a 100% lie....it was the opposite! Why would yalla lie like that, y'all should be ashamed! #ImpeachTrump

@greenfield64 Yeah and Trump's ass doesn't need to call citizens names either, or bash them. No president does that, your suppose to be a leader! Children watch him...and they pick up on that. His life is social media! Any other president would have been ashamed at this man @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump Hey idiot, you need to worry more about Kim Jong un! You know, the man that fooled you into  thinking he ceased all ballistic missiles???? Wow, you really are an Airhead
@realDonaldTrump In all seriousness, it’s pretty surreal to see the President of the United States tweeting flat out propaganda slogans in all capital letters like he’s yelling. And he even attaches a propaganda video. He’s learning so many neat media tricks from Kim Jong Un
@realDonaldTrump You have a serious addiction, stop damn tweeting and start fixing America! All you have done is cost our economy billions! In your own words, A shutdown means the president is weak! Remember saying that in 2013?
@CullmanTribune Glad everyone is ok

@realDonaldTrump Hey Brady? How's those deflated footballs treating ya? Is that what your hiding in that ridiculous looking jacket of yours lol
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump He said in 2013 that if a President shuts down the government, that person is weak, but it's ok for him to do it himself. All his staff is resigning or being arrested, and he's under investigation as we speak. Time is slowly ticking away.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump He made promises like him telling us Mexico will pay for the wall, he knows he said, It was on live TV. His staff is resigning or quiting, that's never happened In the history of presidency. He belittles Nancy and so many more, calls them names. It's unprofessional!
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Man you can't sit there and say there doing that, truth is 95% of what they report is legit. Unfaithful to your mother, i.can keep going boss man. Your dad has ruined your last name, u know this! https://t.co/Z5HWe01Abg
