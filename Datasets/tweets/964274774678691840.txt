Any guard can stop an AR 15 shooter in suburban setting with 12 guage	3" magnum buck shot dead	Nothing walks away from buck shot! Period
Do people really want to stop schools from being shot up! Or blown up or Cut up You have to secure Them Period that is the only Solution! Cut out a year of sports and other BS and spend the money on Securing our schools Now! @GOP
Every we're you go every way you travel there is Armed security except suburban High schools
Layered Security at these Schools and School events Will for all purposes Stop this shit in it's tracks!
These shootings should never have happened It's the world we live in. 	Lock them down Fence them with Armed guards and gated entrance and exits!  @realDonaldTrump   move in on this Executive Actions everyone will thank you! Make it happen
Parents bitch about schools having prison like security! Do you want alive kids that you have to do a little more to see during school hours or readily accessable children in hospital or morgue.	#should have already been Done Secure our schools Now by EO @realDonaldTrump
Fact is We need armed guards! Guard shacks and 	Chain link fencing limit shooters Access 1000%.		At the high school in my town the busses are behind	Chain link fencing and has night watchman. = No more Vandalism!		But any retard can walk right up and go into school during classes
