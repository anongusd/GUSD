In era of equal LGB rights, referring to your SO simply as “my partner” is not only preferable but necessary—keen to see compatriots across pond follow UK’s lead.
I’ve been living in London for 3mos and it’s now undeniable that, here, people don’t say “husband” “wife” “boy/girlfriend” or “fiancé.” 		Instead, everyone universally refers to their significant other as **my PARTNER** which, in US, implies “same-sex partner.”

Serious Q @PhilipWegmann @seanmdav @bdomenech &amp;other men @FDRLST: Are there any women on your staff? If so, would be nice to hear from them.
Right, at point you quoted @PhilipWegmann, which is why I didn't accuse you of violating OTR. You underminded your integrity enough as it is
In fact, I believe I told you, @PhilipWegmann, "I am not a spokesperson in any official capacity so this is off the record." Ah yes, I did!
Let's not keep twisting things @PhilipWegmann. You were only reporter I spoke to bc you asked to speak to someone and I was happy to oblige
Do you really think that was necessary in addition to saying "LPJ, of which I am a member"@PhilipWegmann? You're grasping at straws here.

Just had this convo via Twitter w @HuffingtonPost's @achorowitz RT @JGreenDC: @amaeryllis simple: lots of people willing to write for free
@achorowitz in sum, I exonerate @TheAtlantic but understand why this freelancer would be pissed. Less than ideal situation for both.
@achorowitz 2 things going on 1) qualified journos w not a lot of work opps 2) media outlets hurting and looking to cut where ever possible
@achorowitz it might not be good. But it's also not surprising and will become increasingly common given trajectory.
@achorowitz drives home point that outlets like @TheAtlantic are hurting and this is unfortunate new norm. Also, remember Camp Pocono Ridge?
@achorowitz status quo is going to be established in which good work will not be compensated. Lack of sufficient compensation is issue.
@achorowitz that is oversaturated w unemployed qualified journos just looking for gig, price for work is going to be driven down and..(pt 2)
@achorowitz nothing is disconcerting if $100 is baseline. But $100 still sucks. My point is that in job market like journalism... (pt 1)
@achorowitz ...at a rate of $100 for original, reported stories?
@achorowitz you see same thing happening in over saturated markets like law school. JDs fresh out taking jobs for $20k/year. Also not okay.
@achorowitz when there are fewer journalism jobs but more journalism graduates, this is the market you get. Services cheaper, some for free.
@achorowitz essentially, if @TheAtlantic wants freelance material for free, they can get it. Not saying it's okay. But that's the way it is.
@achorowitz while there are opinion bloggers like me, there are many expert industry bloggers who contribute for free, just want exposure.
@achorowitz if you can get the milk for free, why buy the cow. In this market, harder to make it as journo. Most just want platform.
@achorowitz Exactly. But back to point of freelance and whether @TheAtlantic looks bad for not paying for traditional freelance, well...
@achorowitz your staff growing @Gawker staff growing @buzzfeed staff growing. This is new kind of journalism where trad freelance is harder.
@achorowitz NYT put Boston Globe up for sale. The Atlantic Media Company slashed newsrooms. Time Inc. cut 500 jobs. I'd say that's a lot.
@achorowitz I wouldn't exactly call @HuffingtonPost traditional media site/newsroom. It's "breaking news and opinion."
@TheAtlantic Media Company laid off lots of reporters just before holidays so not surprising they can't pay freelancer for repurposed piece.
@achorowitz to quote @Gawker's Denton "Newspapers and magazines - their ranks clogged by veterans with nowhere else to go - are not hiring."
@achorowitz I don't know a lot of reporters with stable jobs either. Newsrooms being slashed and traditional journalism ain't easy business.
@achorowitz true but again, w rising popularity of blogosphere, anecdotal journalism, oped pieces etc, $ for traditional reporting hard sell
@achorowitz Very true. But when so many are willing to blog for free, that inevitably - though not justifiably - makes freelance harder sell
