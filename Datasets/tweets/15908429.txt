She was from Pittsburgh. And really way too young to be gone.
Last night our boss Dean Baquet called Christine “one of our finest narrative editors and a beloved colleague.”
“We has no idea what we were facing,” Christine explained later in an interview...”we were just thinking about how we hoped that nothing like this would ever have to be written again.”

But I promise you if you read the @nytimes you know her work. Because she did some of the most amazingly affecting stories you read.
