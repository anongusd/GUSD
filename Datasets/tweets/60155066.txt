@jomondrala @profcarroll @podehaye @PrivacyMatters Maybe - in the U.S. Would you participate in one?

@AdamLevitin @FrankPasquale 6/ For example, LexisNexis sells analytics &amp; data products for insurers to "boost profitability". But check the disclaimer in the footer: "does not constitute a consumer report...may not be used as a factor in determining eligibility for credit, insurance" https://t.co/bhusDXnCKe
@AdamLevitin @FrankPasquale 5/ Note the circuity-a consumer report is any info by a consumer reporting agency &amp; a consumer reporting agency is any entity that regularly furnishes consumer reports for permissible purposes. This allows entities that are obviously CRA's to escape responsibility via disclaimers
@AdamLevitin @FrankPasquale 4. ... but specifically info that "is used or expected to be used or collected in whole or in part for the purpose of serving as a factor in establishing the consumer’s eligibility for credit, employment purposes" or other permissible purposes under 15 USC 1681b, eg. insurance.
@AdamLevitin @FrankPasquale 3/ 3. "FOR THE PURPOSE of furnishing consumer reports to third parties" where "consumer reports" is defined under 15 USC 1681(a)d as you noted: "any info by a consumer reporting agency bearing credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation...
@AdamLevitin @FrankPasquale 2/ per 15 USC 1681a, the legal definition of "consumer reporting agency" is rather circuitous. 1. Company/Person; 2. "Regularly engages in whole or in part in the practice of assembling or evaluating consumer credit information or other information on consumers"...
@AdamLevitin @FrankPasquale Agreed that better regulation is needed to protect user privacy on Facebook. But, its an uphill battle to leverage FCRA protections for Facebook data** (** based on currently-known FB data collection and use practices. Revelation of non-public tools could change the calculus.)

@DebbieKennett that is what I said - this is a legal contract. Removal of word perpetual has no effect. No "limiting" language replaced it.
@DebbieKennett Of course, but not the issue here. Ancestry takes ownership, which is legal. I'm simply advocating that customers read terms.

@Ancestry @LifehackerAU The terms &amp; conditions are the record. You own your DNA, but so does Ancestry. Be truthful to your customers.
@Ancestry @JuddLegum Ancestry - you're attacking me personally. I've reached out to you with no avail. Why no courage to contact me?

@wilbanks what's your position on the mandatory binding arbitration clause? Complete waivers of liability?
@wilbanks the contract is the contract. Ancestry drafted it. Customers are bound to it. Could be significantly less broad and onerous.
@wilbanks @wilbanks the law calls it ownership. 2nd sentence says clearly "you still own your DNA, but so does https://t.co/eEdI658JBr."
@wilbanks Not standard terms and conditions. Could be drafted much differently to limit ancestry's ownership and monetization rights.
@wilbanks "perpetual, royalty free, worldwide transferable license to use, sublicense &amp; transfer" genetic data. That's a form of ownership.

@Ancestry @AnnCavoukian ancestry blog post is dicta. Doesnt change T&amp;C that requires customers to give you perpetual, transferable license.
@Ancestry @lydiaemman there are no inaccuracies. AncestryDNA takes ownership via perpetual, royalty free, worldwide, transferable license.
@Ancestry @reverendcaptain ancestry needs to own its T&amp;C and stop spinning. Did you discontinue perpetual, royalty-free, worldwide license?
@Ancestry @IamTHEDiDi Haven't heard from you Ancestry. Can you DM me Eric Heath's contact information?
@louiskessler @legalgen Nothing alarmist about advising customers to read T&amp;C. If you dont want to grant license to your data, dont use it.
@louiskessler @legalgen Thanks for posting. Unless you've achieved immortality, your DNA ownership remains "limited in years". Fact of life.
@louiskessler thanks! have not yet reviewed the T&amp;C from other genetic testing sites. Would welcome a comparison of legal terms.

@Derry_London @Medium Of course. You cant un-own the DNA in your own body! But now @Ancestry owns it too. Perpetual, royalty-free license.
@ShannonXmas @HERA_CITIGEN There's nothing misleading about it. Read the terms for yourself: https://t.co/ZsTJftoTAy

THIS!!! https://t.co/xWyNn5lgDg

@Stephen_Gash @KrisWilliams @KayaJones ancestry terms of service. check out sections 8 and 9. https://t.co/MBqnj0p0HF
@KrisWilliams @Stephen_Gash @KayaJones Customers agree not to file class action. So Ancestry agrees not to sue its customers in class action
@KrisWilliams @Stephen_Gash @KayaJones interesting quirk - ancestry agreed not to join with others and sue you in a class action lawsuit.
@KrisWilliams @Stephen_Gash @KayaJones seems fair, right?! Contract gives Ancestry a perpetual, worldwide, royalty free license to your DNA.
@Stephen_Gash @KayaJones @KrisWilliams yes. if they said deleted but didnt, poss deception &amp; property claims. Arbitration tough but winnable
@KayaJones @KrisWilliams @Stephen_Gash interesting Ancestry was marketing in gifting suite. Wonder if they planning DNA database of VIPs? 💰💰
@Stephen_Gash @KrisWilliams @KayaJones @Ancestry in U.S., wouldnt be a felony. Maybe a civil claim. BUT, legal rights waived - arbitration!
@KrisWilliams @KayaJones @Stephen_Gash very true. will never know *for sure* that DNA sample was destroyed. Would have to trust @Ancestry
@KayaJones @Stephen_Gash @gracey_knoll I think @ancestry will destroy the DNA and delete data, but you have to jump through some extra hoops
