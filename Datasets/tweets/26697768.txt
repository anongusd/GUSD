@DebDingell  And the only reason you guys are demanding trump's tax records is this same reason you guys went after Palins  emails any dirt you can get on somebody that's all you ever do.
@DebDingell  And holding your party accountable you haven't done that in 10 years so give us a break.
@DebDingell  Where still angry at the Democratic Party for allowing your party to use the IRS  to come against the tea party so really get a clue. And you guys want to get rid of ice you're a bunch of wires.
@DebDingell  When you brought that idiot lawyer and question him and he was so smug I'll tell you something a whole bunch of other people decided to vote for 2020. trump do you not see this.
@DebDingell  When the Democratic Party stops acting like a bunch of spoiled little brat's the do not like trump you may actually get people to understand you're serious other than that get off of it because we all see what you're doing.
@RepStephenLynch And just where were you when 4 men in bengazi were murdered and  we couldn't find our president. and where were you when he went golfing when a reporter was behead  and where were you when a picture of Louis farrakhan and our president was being hid where were you then.
@RepStephenLynch Dems never trumpers Hollywood talk shows and the left media is a circus. And this  is your clown.  because you couldn't find anything on Russia and trump now you drag this pathetic human being out.	 Every time this man open his mouth more people disliked the dems.
@RepStephenLynch  I used to be a Democrat I voted for Carter I was a young woman. when I learned what  the party had turned into a was sad and disgusting. You  stand for nothing you stand for hate you stand for division you stand for nothing.	So go after Trump if you must.
@RepStephenLynch you give free stuff as you rip away our money from our families with the tread of jail if we don't pay. You act all holy as you stand with Hollywood as they with their megaphone spread Propaganda to our children.	We get it we see it we are no longer blind.
@RepStephenLynch  dems stand up for illegal that take our jobs and kill our kids. Dems stand up for ms13 as they murder us. Dems stand up for bill ayer Louis farrakhan geroge soroa as they spread hate. Dems put people on lists when the vote for no guns for illegal.
@RepStephenLynch  Trump didn't  Collude with Russia. but the  people want to see the government obey the rule of law. which we have not seen, and that's why so many people voted for trump. So go ahead hide Obama picture with Louis farrakhan and dig up stuff with Trump.
@AmberRajen @RepAdamSchiff @HouseDemocrats Dems truth what's that something get past the bleach bit and hammers.
@RepAdamSchiff how low can you go... even the guys around you are shocked. You can see it in their faces. Expect for the gun grabber. He thinking that a man I want to be. Kick them when their down kind. But were all wake now...we see who you are... geroge
@RochelleRitchie  Do you guys even know how to spell hypocrite
@RochelleRitchie  And on a piece of paper actually be honest look at what Obama did and then look what trump is done in the shortest period of time where's ISIS
@RochelleRitchie  Yeah you keep saying that that Obama's not running but boy did you guys not have a problem with blaming Bush the entire 8 years and he wasn't running either bullys
@RochelleRitchie  Why don't you dem do us all a favor and just admit that way before trump ever became president all the dems and  left all they ever did  smear and attack  say mean cruel things.  they're all bullies and now you guys can't take it when trump gives it back to you.
@TheJuanWilliams  And you cannot say it did not work out we have North Korea talking to us about what we want that is a big big step and it's sad that you dems just want to underplay that it's sad. Wait till your back in power. We have learn to be bullies too now.
@TheJuanWilliams  And taking things at a contents and saying he doesn't want to eat doesn't mean he doesn't want to eat ever. So when he says that certain things that the intelligence agencies suggest he may not agree with doesn't mean he doesn't agree with them at all.
@TheJuanWilliams  But it was perfectly OK to you in your brain that Obama gave a plane full of cash to a country that's killing our military people.
@TheJuanWilliams  what happened to that kid in North Korea is unacceptable. But   asking president trump to do is insane. We have nukes pointed at us from the crazy country. that did this and you want us to go over there and slam down  and demand somehow the honest truth.
@RepAdamSchiff it's so sad, didn't find he was helpped by the Russian now it's the blue dress is it. What a full blown tantrum. You people should be ashame of your selves. Trump doesn't ask for a pay check. But you spend more then what we would have paid him on this.
@CNNPolitics Because  he didn't go golfing in High 5ing  after one of our American reporters was beheaded like a certain president Obama did right.	 As the parents wept in sorrow
@CNNPolitics You know maybe what we should you is check his underwear size we haven't done that yet have we I mean that should be a least some way of an investigation Maybe he wears foreign underwear
@CNNPolitics Yes he will destroy our country just like Obama was doing But even Obama wasn't stupid enough to take down all our borders
@CNNPolitics  Maybe what trump should have done to get a deal is what Obama did. maybe he should have taken a plane full of money like Obama did  and may be then he could have made the deal.
@JulianEpstein  Because who in the world uses hammers and bleach bet to clean their phones and their computers no no no no no no
@JulianEpstein  I hate to blow it for you but the reason people didn't vote for Clinton is because we're pretty sure that with bill being paid that much money and their uranium one deal and all the other dirty dealings that the clintons are in deep.
@JulianEpstein  I think it's amazing how on Fox News tonight  went  you said no no no there is absolutely no problem here with the clintons are you kidding me. do you honestly think anyone in the United States with a 1/2 a brain believes what she just said.
@SpeakerPelosi  Yes Nancy that's a good idea why don't you cheer for the destruction of a peace treaty were trying to get with North Korea.
@RepCummings  So I hope you know that this trial this ridiculous trial with Cohen most people know and can see through this and understand how stupid you think we really are.
@RepCummings  But it's just really incredible that the Clinton foundation and the clintons and Obama will not be investigated because if they had been investigate it what we would have learned would have been horrifying and shocking to this country.
@RepCummings  Yes hes crying out for normal to get back on the road to us become  fundamentally changed into a Communist/socialist under a horrible resume that you democrats will do and it's on believable this is happening again in our country shame on all of you.
@craigmelvin  But go ahead keep pretending like you're actually telling us the news and will keep laughing at you.
@craigmelvin  the 20/20 that's beautiful and then the interview attacking the teen agers saying do you feel ashamed is to much.	Hollywood dems have lost it.	 You guys over there are so afraid you're not gonna get invited to the Hollywood party that you'd like a  nerd kid.
@craigmelvin  This is why people voted for trump MSNBC and CNN they're not just fake news there Hollywood nonsense news.  Bill Maher couldn't be further from the truth nobody wants to be you guys we want you guys to knock it off and grow up.
@craigmelvin what the prolbem is you need to come up for air,  the bottom of the I hate trump trippers.	he try to kiss me To he push my head down and foces me is like night and day. You're calling trump a predator then what would you call the guy that forced those  girls  monster
@craigmelvin and nothing gets said about Virginia guy  that rape two girls, but Trump try to kiss a girl are you insane. Do you guys even know how insane you sound. You push nothing but liars the guy with the drum, the actor that  lie he was attack. Insane.
@TheJuanWilliams  Jessie and the remark he should have gone in to neeson's neighborhood. Why is it OK to slam white people.
@TheDemCoalition Let judge Obama
@Rosie Wow guess learning where your family came from on who do you think you are. Didn't help much.
@TarihSinema You with hawking is like a spoiled child and a real grownup.
@sally_alcot @DrinkingJimmy @mattman7901 @JimCarrey Hes bad but so is Louis farrakhan and what his faith does to little girls and boys.
@JimCarrey Now do Obama with four American being murder in Benghazi. And golfing as and American reporter is beheaded and his parent in tears.
@GregGutfeldShow Trump is trying to teach us to stop feeling sorry for everyone that kicked us in the face.	Isis  beheaded kids no forgiveness from USA this time.
@maddow Fast and furious bengazi
@InvestigateRU Anyone that would believe a word out of  this liar's mouth has to have their head examined
@Newsweek Now put Obama in place of Trump with Harvey Weinstein bill Ayers Louis farrakhan and your telling the truth Hollywood hides.
@ChantalArtist @steph93065 @RepAdamSchiff Louis farrakhan bill Ayers Harvey Weinstein funny how all that was cover up right. Kind of like the  attack that wasn't by red rats.
@amjoyshow  It's funny when you look at the States that are filed against the emergency act to build a wall all of them hire illegals. people should understand that modern day slavery is the illegal and it is sinful and they should want to stand up against this.
@amjoyshow  The people you have on your show that talk so big they should take a really close look at their background and what they've done before they continue throwing rocks.
@amjoyshow   I had a friend that was military say I cannot believe the scum and trash that we have allowed to be in our military. That's  rise to the highest ranks we should all be ashamed of yourself that we have so many gang members in the military.
@amjoyshow  And by the way we're not talking about this stupid pay people the brain washed that would jump off a cliff. we're talking about the hard working grass root people you couldn't kill with their drugs.
@amjoyshow  You and I both know this is all about one thing big money and the powers to be and what's really weird is you guys are so dumb that you don't even see that the real power is still with the people and that's how Trump got in.
@amjoyshow  It's not that I'm upset that you slam trump every day I'm upset that you guys are such hypocrites that you didn't say anything about Obama or Clinton and all this just to get dems  back in power your disgusting.
@amjoyshow  It's called skin in the game a gang member is busted  and  the family that hes living with or she's living with loses all federal and state aid for ever. unless they turn them in. I bet the gangs would be gone in a year. Push that I dare you.
@amjoyshow  White nationalist Have you looked at the streets of Chicago lately are you kidding me do you think we're stupid. There only one way we end gangs.
@amjoyshow  The crips the bloods there are so many gangs MS13 the list is so long it's unbelievable. And still somehow you grab whole of this one gang and you say see look there the badd badd guys. Really you think us stupid do you.
@amjoyshow @matthewamiller Hollywood is the biggest megaphone and yes many have been brain washed. Many have fallen in to drugs. But the real American are still standing with the founders of this country. And you can hurt them no matter what you say.
@amjoyshow @CynthiaAlksne Trump and Epstein Obama and Louis farrakhan bill Ayers and Harvey Weinstein. Come on you think we dont see your no longer news. Your the dem propaganda machine. Trump didn't betray America like some he betrayed Hollywood and that's why you're anger.
@amjoyshow. Obama's  not  just friends they had their daughter working with Harvey Weinstein. so when you talk about Trump knowing Epstein, you have to stop and think what  if you're friends with Louis farrakhan and bill Ayres too. But your bullies and only shame Trump
@morningmika so now that he wasn't attack and he lie. And the Russians thing not working. So are you just swiping the black face under the rug with Virginand the rape. You guys are low.
@JimCarrey He didn't betray America he betrayed Hollywood that's the problem.
@ZimmermanRob  You made my point. about kamela Harris you attacked the GOP on the other hand the person on the other side. made a joke about it and let it pass you guys are bullies that's my point.
@TheJuanWilliams  No hes not out of touch with those things he doesn't understand why they are such a big deal in our country when it should be defense and businesses.
@TheJuanWilliams  If trump is so out of touch with the people why is it the people understand what he is saying but have a real rough time understanding anything that comes out of the Democratic Party's
@TheJuanWilliams  To actually stand on the side of the reporter that got him to say stuff another word she played good cop no she believed every word he said and he  hung himself that's what happened.
@TheJuanWilliams  When your president  the Democratic Party stands with someone like Louis farrakhan and has his daughter working with someone like Harvey Weinstein don't you fine trying to connect trump to a Russian as agent is absolutely ridiculous.
@TheJuanWilliams  And he doesn't come really really hard against 45 he goes with the flow of the morons from Hollywood that says this is the cool thing to do because if you're not doing it you aint cool.
@TheJuanWilliams   it wasn't about just a Red Hat it was anyone that voted for trump we are the bag guys you guys are the good guys  tell you start realizing how bad that smells I don't think you're going to straighten your party up at all you guys are a bunch of spoiled brats.
@TheJuanWilliams  We are accused by people in the government on your party we are accused on the talk shows we are accused from Hollywood we are accused by  most of  the media we are constantly accused of being racist bigots sexist when it's actually you guys.
@TheJuanWilliams  No no one is celebrating this we are pointing out what constantly constantly goes on from being called deplorable to   this were sick of it we're sick of you dems  doing this to us you democrats need to stop nonsense
@RochelleRitchie people are sick of the left, they are rude and bullies. Trump is that too, thats why they hate him. He's not Mitt Romney sit down shut up Obama talking now.	Trump didn't betray America he betrayed Hollywood.
@RochelleRitchie  You know it's amazing how rude you were to your host on cavoto but you simply ran over the person next to you as if that's perfectly OK that's our point.	 Trump bad is all you see.
@AC360 And  the military guy that you're talking to right now should be really ashamed of himself because he was supposed to protect our country.
@AC360 People that seriously think that the house wives  are real are the people that are listening to your shows buying that that's out dumb you guys sound.
@AC360 If you guys do not knock this off people are going to honestly think you're all crazy I mean seriously that is the talk among anyone over 30 anyone under 30 might buy your nonsense very crazy under 30.
@AC360 Do you guys have any idea how ridiculous you sound right now please stop it you're making yourself look so badd.
@andersoncooper  Anderson please stop this you do realize that trump has been harder on Russia than Obama was and everybody out here in the real world knows it what is wrong with you people.
@andersoncooper . The only way you can save the party now is to  literally coming out and telling the truth.
@andersoncooper  What's really sad is I was once a Democrat and I am so ashamed to ever say I was.
@andersoncooper  do you know crazy you sound what is wrong with you people. do you not know that the rest of us in the United States are literally laughing at your shows. Your not even the media anymore your  propaganda shows that are so obvious it's ridiculous.
@komonews all I do is scream at the tv every day when your on. 	How dare you cover up what Obama did and do this to Trump.
@komonews 	You are so in to the nonsense of Hollywood you don't get it.	Bought and pay for.	You well not tell the truth of all the good Trump done. Sad. You will be held responsible if our country falls like Venezuela. By doing this.
@komonews Trumps right about that news out let it's been best for lying. And he never said put someone easy in. But running the storys together helps drive your point home.
@komonews you gave a story about north Korea and Trump hair cuts. And you really had to say the  leader that not only has murder his own people, but a young man from the USA. His parents must be so happy you reported that. Great job..
@RochelleRitchie  I wish there was a way I wish there was something that 1 day this was not a thing. It makes life extremely hard on everything.	And your right people who make up attacks make it worse.
@RochelleRitchie  What I learned was there as many people of color that are just as racist as people that are white that a racist that sad.	One of my friends said her husband wouldn't let her come visit me after I moved to Redondo beach. He fear she be hurt.
@RochelleRitchie 1973 I lived in Inglewood ca and worked there. I learn many people fear coming to white city's as there were many were fearful of coming to Inglewood.	I never fear living there but I was sometimes mistreated because I was white. Sad.
@BarbMcQuade @thedailybeast But the whole point was to find if Trump was supported by Russia right? Or was it just throwing things at the wall seeing what sticks.
@Morning_Joe joe are you so bought and pay for you are never coming to your senses.  Is this the America you want for your kids. Wake up.
@Morning_Joe now you stand up for McCabe. They were not  freck out as your guess just said. They were dem supporters and were over throwing the president went do you see this.
@Morning_Joe I think you have said it all by saying it's our job to tell the people what to think.
@FoxNewsSunday  And by the way if you really wanna look at something look at all of the people that are shooters that are not  gangs what do they all have in common it's not mental illness it's child abuse that they have suffered from. Mental and physical abuse.
@FoxNewsSunday  People keep saying that we need to take guns away from the public that we have too many guns that is such a lie we have to get rid of the gangs and the illegals that come over here that do not care about our laws.
@FoxNewsSunday  People need to take a step back and understand why we voted for trump it wasn't because we're hateful or  deplorable  we're sick  of a system where they live behind gates, walls and security  were left defenseless  we have to send our kids to school and they dying
@FoxNewsSunday  What Mr. Miller just said with so much the truth you cannot live in certain cities not because of the gangs that we have here there badd but the gangs coming in are even worse.
@FoxNewsSunday  People do not care what the left says anymore they're just tired of it. They can be bullies all they want and calls every name they want to call us but it's just a fact as American States since we're fed up with it.
@FoxNewsSunday  When you talk to people that have been attacked and their family members had been murdered by illegals that have come  across that border you know there is an emergency.
@FoxNewsSunday  When someone comes to your house to buy steel  ask them how long they have been doing this only a few months  then you ask them what they did before they had a landscape business  ask him what happened they say we can't complete with all of the illegales.
@FoxNewsSunday  You know how we can tell there's an emergency in our country when a family lives in A-tent in the winner in Washington and illegal has the job at a meat packing plant or other restaurant or  in a hotel.  they can't find work and they're American citizens.
@FoxNewsSunday  You know how you can tell that was an emergency at the border when in 1971 at the International house of pancakes when your asked if a friend of yours can get a job washing dishes or cooking or bussing tables an your boss says no we only hire illegals in back.
@SenTedCruz by making some people that have mental health problems but are dealing with it fear they lose their rights to safety by taking their guns. Will only make people not seek help.
@SenTedCruz	Skin in the game. A gange member busted their family knows so they will no longer get any aid. They be turning them in. Also shooters are child abuse victims physically abused and mentally.
@SenTedCruz Great idea
@SpeakerPelosi most of the shooting are gangs and child abuse victims that turns in to I'll people.
@SpeakerPelosi don't threaten the American people because Trump wants the illegal aliens to stop flowing in to our country. Were all sick of the dems threatening us.	Ends gangs by hurting their families that know they are gangsters gun frist.
@RepAdamSchiff My sister was almost run down and killed by illegals it's not a lie. She walked to the store and almost lost her life.
@RepAdamSchiff Illegals taking our jobs hurt us more. The dems need to show us you care about us.
@RepAdamSchiff Could it be the right is actting like the left.
@RepAdamSchiff You got to let this Russia Trump thing go your looking  a little silly.
When your people are Hollywood you got a real problem. Frist ladies got no business dealing with these beings that got real problems.
@Karoli @MSNBC @bluegal When you wake up and understand who the dems really are, it will knot you off your feet. They claim their on the side of the people but their not.	I woke 1976 with Carter's run...
@Karoli Go live a year in Inglewood ca.
@Karoli I worked for carter it wasn't Reagan with iran. It was carter sorry to say that did that.
@BuildTheWave  I just saw you and Tucker carlston and  America has been doing  all of that and a bag of chips and we've asked China to do nothing. Don't be hating on America back it off
@SenTedCruz  OK if you run in 2024 I will definitely vote for you now you rocking that beard my husband has beard I trust men with beards please keep it.
@IlhanMN  But you and the other person and some of the other people the Democratic Party. I have to thank you so very much because we're  proving trump right about the Democratic Party being completely lost in the woods.
@IlhanMN Believe it or not and I know this is going to come as is shocking idea to you but usually Burger flipping jobs go to teenagers and college kids.
@IlhanMN Now that's capitalist because see that person has a job that he had to work from the bottom all the way up.  just like all the other people do that's called capitalism, what you want is Communist and you're in the wrong country.
@IlhanMN @realDonaldTrump Now I know something about this and what you just said is a complete lie are you a liar.
@IlhanMN  I have no idea of the hatred that you have in your heart for this country. but I will tell you one thing you should really get a book and read it about what America is all about. because I don't think you even get a clue of who we are.
@craigmelvin  75% of all murders are done by gangsters and the gangs  murderers. The rest of these people that go and kill other people like this are   child abuse victims either sexual or mental maybe we should look into that.
@craigmelvin the dems are backing haters like the young Congress woman and Louis farrakhan. Sad on them after all the attacks on Trump. They're nothing but hypocrites.
@SenFranken @alfranken Trump didn't betray America he  betrayed Hollywood and that's why they hate him.
@SenSchumer shame on you sir for the illegal and drugs that come in to our country you and your party are to blame. Build the wall stop the crime stop calling Citizens name you work for us.
@MSNBC @JoeNBC You dare call Trump what, explain Louis farrakhan and Obama picture. You got a picture of David Duke  and Trump you have room to talk. Other wise back off.
@LukeBrussel Think people are sick of the left and attacks on Trump. Get a  Clue.	When you have constantly attacked half of the United States by calling them deplorable what did you expect.
@CNNTonight @donlemon Maxine waters Obama and Clinton many other dems with a racist Louis farrakhan.
@SenBlumenthal @RepSwalwell Make stronger laws  to protect our cops, use to be kill a cop you got the death penalty what happen. I begged my daughter not to be a cop because the dems have open season on them. Shame on you.
Trump didn't betray America he betrayed Hollywood and that is where the hate is coming from.
What we can see today is an absolute disgrace in our government how the dems pander so much to the mentally ill of our  societie. Time to pander to the strong families and understand we are sick of government that has betrayed us.
Want shooting to stop 75% of all murders are from gangs. Make a  law any gang member busted. The family they live with will no longer get welfare or and benefits. Unless they turn them in now.
It's not just mental illness that are shooters, its child abused victims. As I said before if we don't end the child  sexual abuse we will never end the homeless and drug prolbems.
@Jehmu  Trump didn't betray America he betrayed Hollywood and that's what this anger is all about because Hollywood is angry. You guys have bullies we got one too. So get over calling him a bully your party done it all the time.
@Jehmu  You guys are so used to over at the Democratic Party of playing in the gutter you don't even know when you're not playing in the gutter. Omar just forgiven. Maxine waters hugging Louis farrakhan,  Obama picture with Louis farrakhan.
@Jehmu  Did you just say that trump plays in the gutter. You gotta be kidding right. Do you have any idea how it feels to be a Republican to Mitt Romney McCain and Bush and the horrible things that your Democratic Party has said about our people.
@Lowey4Congress do your job build a wall. Stop expecting us taxpayers to give billions of aids to the same countries they have their poor come here and live off us. Why we voted Trump why we are anger at dems nonsense.
@ABCWorldNews no the fence did make it go  down tell the truth were sick of the lie.
@ABCWorldNews https://t.co/tR1RkDWHCG
@ewarren you can use lies to get where you are. You can say how ashame and sorry you are. But if you think we want someone like you as president think again. If you were sorry leave government office.  Shame on you.
Elizabeth warren
@SenAmyKlobuchar  People like you should quit the government and go into the private sector and see if you can actually make some money. before you come and work for us because you gonna run us the United States in a bankruptcy.
@SenAmyKlobuchar  Your party keeps saying that the socialism that we want is different than Venezuela that is such a lie because that's where it will lead to and you know it.
@SenAmyKlobuchar and your party is pushing socialism so how can you say we are a beacon of light to the world when you want to turn it in to what the world has become.
@SenAmyKlobuchar  And it's insulting and it's reckless to not make the difference. I'm ashame of people like you that preach this stuff and fools buy in to it. Come on tell the truth.
@SenAmyKlobuchar
@SenAmyKlobuchar  I understand what you're saying that we need to be more welcoming. but you need to understand that the people that come here over the border are not the  people you're talking about.
@SenAmyKlobuchar   you told about the little girl and man that told them to go home. Me and my girls were walking to the nearby store and 3 very tough looking guys not from America because only one could speak English told us it would be so easy to kill us and we could stop them.
@TheJuanWilliams  70% of the United States do not want socialism and they do not want the green deal go state by state  do an actual poll ask people from both parties you would have a very different number  you lie with statistics polls lie when you said Clinton would win.
Chris please do your homework El Paso after the fence was built there was less crime look it up everybody knows this you just lied on TV.
@TeamJeffries your statement or question was so out of line. you must think only people that either are so stupid or live in a cave. didn't understand you just try to make lines to Trump by laws broken in the past with nothing to do with Trump. Wow
@KamalaHarris did you really call ice Nazis.when FBI were so over the top with an American citizen Mr stone with guns pointing. The American public is getting to the point where they don't trust anybody in government anymore. Why they voted Trump.
@SenBlumenthal  Transparency where were you with Obama. The people are listening you better wake. The public it's getting tired of these dirty tricks that the dems play. And credibility is getting thin with the constant lying coming from the dems.
@maziehirono the abortion will be ended if they push for late term. 	As a person who was happy to see abortion come to law. I know this push will be the tipping point to end it. And the dems will be to blame.
@amyklobuchar  But now you stand  in  judgment of president trump and you know how odd the American people see you when you do this.	 Holding people to  the standards is extremely important and you didn't with Obama.
@amyklobuchar  I'm going to fundamentally change America those words should of put shivers up your spine and still it didn't that was from president Obama. 	 They cling to their bibles and their guns how judgmental can you get with those words so horrible.
@SenWhitehouse remember  this when the question about Islam is asked watching you on cspan2 	Wish you had feeled this way about also about Indicting a president. When someone said we are going to fundamentally change America.
@RepSwalwell  I find it very strange that you would make it so difficult for the common people that are very intelligent and gun smart. But not laws that  would go after the gangs what is wrong with you.
@RepSwalwell  Most people that have any knowledge of this understand that most of the deaths in America are caused by gang violence with guns. And the gangs.
@RepSwalwell. Skin in the game make it a law where a gang member is busted their  family they lives with will not receive any financial federal  or state aid from the government. I bet they be turning them in and kicking them out. Gun violence will ends.
@RepSwalwell
@yeampierre remember paper sack were bad now plastic is. Maybe we need to think about things frist.
@yeampierre it seems like only a time ago we were working to break from countries that hated America. Now we seems to want to go back there odd.
@staceyabrams its was both the president and Nancy that shut our government down. They need to work together for America. not say i will give a dollar, let them who suffer a the hands of illegal speck out. Were done. Were done with them that don't hear us.
Guess you take so many vacation you have to catch up on your work some times.
Nancy you were not touch by the story of the angel family how cold are you.
@SpeakerPelosi so disappointed in you reading when you flip out over Obama speech and paul rayan never was this small.
@RepCuellar wall wall wall not 14 century do you not listen to us.	Were so sick of you people that are wanting open borders. Border patrol will tell you your wrong.
@SpeakerPelosi wall wall wall wall wall are you not hearing us what is wrong with dems. Your so hateful.
@kendisgibson let's be honest the only reason people hate on Trump becaues he's in the way of where the new nazi want to take America.
@CNNSotu  They keep asking how did trump become president well think about it you answered it by this kind of craziness.
@CNNSotu  I cannot believe that the Democratic Party is actually going to have illegal immigrants at the state of the Union this is such a slap in the face to every homeless jobless American citizen.
@RichardGrenell @VP I get it when gays could get married they had a big issue and they had every right to complain about it but now it's the law let's move on to getting some other things taken care of.
@RichardGrenell @VP A 118 kids go missing by strangers every year there never found and when they are it's usually by a hunter that has fallen over the remains of their body that is the next issue we need to make laws that put these monsters to death.
@RichardGrenell @VP Trump doesn't care who your marry to and  if the VP is against gay marriage so what each to their own. Its the law stop crying that everyone doesn't agree with you. So what half will half won't grow up move on. Next prolbem. Child abuse let's end this.
@TheJuanWilliams   If they dig deeper they're probably going to find liberals were behind hiring these people and helping them get papers.
@TheJuanWilliams the  dems  going  to invite illgal immigrants to the state of the Union address that is such a slap in the face to every homeless jobless  American citizen. We value them over you and your family is what its saying shame on the dems. Wonder why we vote trump
@DanaPerino facebook has helpped turn the Mitt Romney followers the geroge Bush followers in to fighters not cowards. Mitt threw the debate and Bush said nothing as Obama blame him for everything. But stood up against Trump. I'm shame of them so are many.
@TheJuanWilliams  And the word provocative I would say it is provocative when someone says I plan on changing your country fundamentally or having a picture with someone that hates Jews and white people I think that's probably provocative.
@TheJuanWilliams  See it's not just the hatred for trump it's anything that is not the Democratic Party and that's where you have a problem because you're no different than those crazy people way to the right like David Duke and Louis farrakhan to the left.
@TheJuanWilliams  What you just said about the Mega hat is exactly how some people view when somebody wears anything to do with Islam that's how narrow minded you sound but then you don't see it that way and unfortunately that's the problem.
@KamalaHarris we can't afford you.
@Alyssa_Milano @JohnnyAi What has happen to you.
@JohnnyAi you must think us stupid to believe the dems want to stop illegals coming in. But were not, we see the lack of work they do to stop it. We have family in the border towns.go there. Liar
@maddow  And the next time I hear somebody saying they do jobs that Americans won't I am going to throw up because Americans do all those jobs and worse ones.
@maddow  I think the problem  is the fact that your father was a lawyer and your mother she was a school administration. pretty good money you lived in California you lived a pretty good life. what you're not understanding not everyone had those privileges you were priviledged
@maddow  My husband worked on this city streets digging ditches and he was a 55 year old man give me a break. Where can the Hyperion plant with floaters so boho illegals.
@maddow  I am so tired of all these stories when I have seen myself and my daughters do jobs that are so much harder than maid and cook jobs.
@maddow  Not everyone comes from a family that can support them and have them go to school some actually have to work hard labor jobs and unfortunate the illegals they take them jobs from those American citizens  you should be ashamed yourself.
My daughters they're both American citizens they have tried and tried to get jobs like madi  jobs anything that they could get they had kids they were constantly turned away. So sorry little lambs
@maddow
@AreuCathy your very young but 1970 they took  jobs from our citizens then they get bused go home come back in two weeks.	Drop food on the floor put it back on your plate. Not wash their hands, couldn't understand a word they said. And it wasn't right.
@AreuCathy please if you really want America to change understand we kind of like things like freedom.	And were sorry your so anger but get over it. They are not undocumented immigrants, they are illegal aliens that work under the talbe don't pay taxes and send money home.
@AreuCathy I use to think they put you on, to have someone on the other side to show the other side.	But just learn you really think this way. And if this is the truth.  Wow how what really....
@MediaBuzzFNC  The right has always acted like cowards when it's come to the left being ridiculous. The only thing trump is done is give the right a kick in the butt and said stand up to these bullies.
@MediaBuzzFNC  So because of the Catholic kids you said that the left piled on then when they found out the kids were  the innocent ones then  the right piled on. No, the right did what Mitt Romney nevertrumper never did. They stood up and called out the left.
@JessicaTarlov  Racist comes in all kinds. Take a good look in the mirror. 	The thing you hate maybe your self.
@JessicaTarlov 	Out lawing a make America great again hat. says alot about not the hate of Trump and his  supporters. But for the bill of rights and constitutional.
@SpeakerPelosi you keep this up more people well be voted for Trump.
@SpeakerPelosi more people understand why we have to vote Trump in again becaues of what you just did.
@AllanLichtman  And a person that actually says we have to pass the bill to find out what's in the bill you think this person should be president really.
@AllanLichtman  I think any president that writes a book that is so blatantly racist and is seen with someone that is so racist should never be  Respect it it what do you think. Do you know who I'm talking about?
@DebDingell  The word on the street is if trump does not run we will vote for anyone that is not already in our government. Because we do not trust you anymore.
@DebDingell  Walls are not immoral and it doesn't matter how many people get into that Room. if you don't bring ice  and the border patrol in you are not doing the people's business. you're doing politics and I think you get the point we're sick of it.
@DebDingell  Walls are not about division. that's why you have a front door. more than likely you have a fence around your house. Are  you about division are you division against your neighbors.
@SpeakerPelosi all the sad storys of people not being paid doesn't help the parents of murder loved ones by illegal aliens. Open the government this has gone to far.
@HarfMaria  Do you think that other countries  just becaues your parents brought you there.  As a child's and now you French your German your all these countries citizens. I don't think it works like that.
@SavannahGuthrie it was NBC that released a private conversation.  Now treating this kid that some how he's to blame. You answer the question why people voted for Trump. Disgusted with you people.
@MarkWarner  Nobody wants the government to be  shut down. but what you dems need to understand.  we're tired of  American citizen not  t coming 1st. We thought you hot that when Trump won. And you done is attack us.
@MarkWarner   problem  you're not seeing is there so many people that have lost their businesses. because of illegals coming to this country working for such cheap psy. these people cannot compete so they lose their little business they end up on food stamps and it's your fault.
They have taken the jobs that college kids an high school kids used to get as starter jobs. there is no starter jobs anymore. So the kids have no idea how to get jobs anymore. What did Obama do to help any of these problems nothing. Same with Bush.
People are sick and tired of hearing that Jim's carpet cleaner business went out of business because of illegals. or Bob's business for yard clean up went out of business because of illegals. or Jose landscaping business went out of business because of illegals.
Americans don't care what color you are that is not an American problem, no matter what people want to say. American  just want a fair break. You can't get that when people come to your country and work for next to  nothing you can't compete. that's why people want the wall.
Trump does something, it doesn't just talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk. That is what dems and never trumpers do for ever and the people are sick of it.
Trump says we need a safer country, says China not playing fear.  says we need term limits we don't need lifetime politicians. says We need to allow businesses to grow instead of regulating them to make more money for the government and taxes  them pushing them to leave.
@JoyVBehar  I have a great idea why don't you tell the truth a why you want trump to get out isn't it because hes level  taxes on your rich people and you're not happy with it.
@HallieJackson  By the way the reason I'm saying something is because the only reason you guys are gaining people, is there leaving CNN  the other HATE TRUMP  channel.
@HallieJackson 	 How can anybody take you seriously when you are so bias. It's like I wanna know what's happening at the Democratic Party turn on MSNBC.
@HallieJackson  Does it bother you at all that you are literally the right arm of the Democratic Party and not news reporter. You trash the gop, and shine with the dems.
@repdonnaedwards  You cannot speak for the American public and say we do not want A wall. and say it's because of political polls. Which  were wrong of who we wanted as president. You do not answer questions you talk in circles and that is a problem we're all sick of.
@FoxNewsSunday  There's one thing I would love to get out there trump did not betray America he betrayed a Hollywood and that's why the dems hate him.
@FoxNewsSunday  I would add 1 other thing it is never the democratic leaders that attack. they have attack dogs in Hollywood talk shows the left leaning media that rip into people's lives, and families. Dems  they walk away with their hands clean.
@FoxNewsSunday  Donna Edwards what is wrong with you. The problem is her party so wanted the buzzfeed  story to be true that this is such a let down.
@ChrisHunterFL  Do you have kids do you teach your children what you preach. The they should work hard cleaning up the next door's yard and garage and house. while they do nothing but sit in your house while you work.
@ChrisHunterFL . It is not the job Of American tax payers to go to their countries and make their countries like ours. For  they can live in it, it is up to them to work hard to make their countries into our country.
@ChrisHunterFL. I have worked in many restaurants unfortunately many  restaurants  hired illegals as cooks next time you go to restaurant with your family. the food, I want you to remember I have seen them drop food on the floor, and put it right back on your plate.
@ChrisHunterFL that's is why when they come here, they break our laws, drive down wages, kill people end up in our prisons.
@ChrisHunterFL we can not fix ever countrys problems that's up to their people. The reason they come here is we fixed our problem so well. They want in on it, with out the work we had to do to get it. Wake up.
@maddow but Mueller said the buzzfeed story was  wrong. So you and the Trump haters are trying to make Mueller a liar.
@maddow  Literally you have gone on and on about Cohen and you don't even understand how stupid this whole thing is	 You are aware that head of CIA lie to Congress. Clinton lie to Congress. So no you shouldn't.
@maddow  Do you know when I go round and ask people why they voted for trump one of the biggest reasons. The smirk on the news reporters faces that hate trump. You would think you guys had gotten wind of this and stopped
@maddow  You guys you need to think about something else other than trump. You're starting to sound like you're obsessed with. Muller came out and said there is no there there.
@JessicaTarlov  I stop being a Democrat back in the days of Carter I was starting to see the party become nothing but a bunch of spoiled brats. that said you can't say that but I can say anything I want and it was starting to get scary because it's starting to look like Communist
@JessicaTarlov  Met Romney John McCain George Bush those days are gone. we're tired of being the growing ups. while we get to act  like  kids  beating us up. Step back and take a good hard look. Nancy's great but Trump is a child. No he calls you out.
@JessicaTarlov  This is  greatest lesson of all to have trump. because maybe  holding  a mirror up to yourself.  realize how we have had  to see the dems and  the kinds  non sense that you complaining about with trump. is how dems always  act like.
@JessicaTarlov  Let's be honest the reason you guys hate trump is because trump is not like Mitt Romney. hes like you and that's what you cannot stand, you guys have been so used to being  little spoiled children, while the adults always put up with you.  now its in your face.
@JessicaTarlov  What you just did on Fox News is exactly what we've been talking about. everybody allowed you to talk. And then, like a true dem you but in and and have to start talking over someone. that's what we're sick of. That's why we call dems   bully.
@SRuhle  I mean these are the questions do you think that trump is an alien from another planet and if so do you think we can send him back home.
@SRuhle  I mean I'm not stupid I get it you're trying to make a name for yourself but do you ever feel ashamed of yourself really.
@SRuhle  I cannot believe the  things that you say they're so outrageous that sometimes I wonder if you're even on this planet you're so far out there.
@CillizzaCNN  show  ridiculous picture of president trump. Still  president Obama standing with  Louis farrakhan is priceless. Or  him standing in the living Room of  terrorist like bill Ayers.  church with rev Wright. Screaming how much he hates the United States.
@TheJuanWilliams  I think this saddest part of this whole thing is it's not just you it's your entire party that is constantly bullies that's who you are just like that other  Bob beck. Chauvinist bullies.
@TheJuanWilliams  Never once did I ever hear anyone on the 5 ever say he will stand up there and just tell lies when Obama was president. How dare you be so ridiculous but then your party is the party of Nancy and Chuck ridiculous.
@komonews how about the people killed by illegals  you don't care about them. And what Trump means  he didn't collaborate with the Russians. And isis attack was ever day under Obama. And that's why he want our guys out of their. You always try to make Trump bad.
@NathanLerner  Most of the people that come here from these other countries are not fleeing violence they're looking for a handout because we have made it so nice.
@NathanLerner   So we are not causing these people by building a wall to die. they are causing their own Dead  by insisting on breaking  our laws in coming in illegally. And that would be open borders.
@NathanLerner  And by the way the reason that the way we vote for presidents works. because that way a whole bunch of people in New York and Los Angeles don't overthrow the people in the country. That way everyone gets a voice not ruled by bullies.
@NathanLerner  Guess what our constitution our bill rights Capitalism. Still works. And we will be okay even if new comers want to throw it all out. Balance and checks will right our way.
@RepBetoORourke  But I'm  begging  you on bended knees please have some respect for this country and for its citizens. We not the brain washed sheep are so sick of liars game players. And please don't try to fundamentally changes us.
@RepBetoORourke   maybe you're just riding a wave, that you think will take you all the way to the White House.  may be that it's just your desire for power and greed. Like the last dem.
@RepBetoORourke  I keep listening to you say that walls don't work, and still George Soros an all the others. have walls around their homes why do they do that if walls do not work.	Walls in our homes with locked doors.
@ChrisCoonsforDE  We are also very much aware that the dems   sit back and have their attack dogs do the dirty work. it's refreshing that  that trump actually calls people out on his own without having to send out  attack dogs.
@ChrisCoonsforDE  We're also extremely aware why you people want trump to stop tweeting because that way you can fill everybody heads full nonsense that is called propaganda you should be ashamed yourself.
@ChrisCoonsforDE  . And it would really be a good idea if dems  would tell the talk shows Hollywood and  the media. that they should back it up a little bit because half of the United States getting tired of getting called names by you people.
@ChrisCoonsforDE  And the one thing we're really getting try of the most of all is the mauler investigation because as you and I both know. there is no collusion there is no obstruction and this is just another way to get your way and we know it.
@ChrisCoonsforDE  Why doesn't democrats and never trumpers practice that in the mirror maybe you'll get good at it and maybe then you'll understand what the public wants because we're really sick of what you're giving us.
@ChrisCoonsforDE  You are what's wrong with our government  Chris asked you  a straight question you did everything but answer it. now you know why we voted for trump when you ask him something he answers the question.
@Acosta A manufacturing crisis! No. And anyone with half a brain knows that the dems are being disingenuous. https://t.co/IqFagvyhuI
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump So all of them money we give them in aid isn't working is what you're saying correct Eric.
@PrestonTVNews did you just kiss up to Obama by saying Obama had more what's wrong with you. Are you two...Obama had more watching him. Your the  prolbem not Trump.
@Reuters  You guys need to knock this off and realize how about it looks for you guys in the nearest.
@Reuters  You know replaying when Obama shut the government down and then listening to you do you realize how angry people get support trump really fails you're not helping the democrats.
@TheJuanWilliams dumping on Trump big business keeping up with the jones.
@TheJuanWilliams  Do you realize that Obama lied constantly go check it out so before you say that Obama didn't lie wake up you're the liar.
@TheJuanWilliams  No, Mr. Williams socialism is not social security. And it wasn't a radical idea. But guess what  the corrupt took the money for other programs. But you don't care right. You said the truth. When you said middle eastern men made you nervous on planes.
@TheJuanWilliams
@HalftimeReport  I love watching you guys. the only problem I have is NBC that dig through every dirty tape they  had on everyone to hurt  trump in a Van. but hid Obama's Louis farrakhan pictures.  Sad.
@HalftimeReport  You guys are such little scaredy cats to endorse anything that trump has done your pathetic.
It was when bill ayer got into the colleges and people like him that corrupted the minds of the children. back in the days when they were against cops against America against the military. because the Vietnam war  that is what's happened to our colleges. And  Louis farrakhan.
@Romney4Utah stand by Trump you shame us in the debate. We will not sell America out. Don't be and  opportunist we have enough  those crazy people in this country. You don't care about anyone no different then Obama.
@JoeMSNBC what do you call a president that goes golfing after a American behead. It's not a joke. It's called out of his mind. Or where was he when bengazi happening hiding. So name the stuff what  Trump done or stop.
@RashidaTlaib . America is not a ship it is not capsize it is a raft that takes on water and ounces back. no matter what lunatic comes into our  country thinks that they can capsize or change us. They learn doesn't happen. Our forefathers were a wake.
@ChrisStirewalt  understand lot of these people that come to our country they're not really into washing. because they don't have running water some places and they live in very very poor areas.
@ChrisStirewalt  And they clean our hotel rooms yes they  do. I saw a maid one day take a wash cloth that you use on your face and wiped down a toilet.
@ChrisStirewalt  It's one of the reasons that my family never get sick because I know what the restaurants hire.  I know what they do behind those closed doors.  if you knew it would make you sick and you wouldn't want your children eating it either.
@ChrisStirewalt  And the next time somebody says these people that are illegal that cook our food. I used to work in restaurants with the illegals they drop food on the floor and put it back on your plates. they go to the bathroom and they don't wash her hands. 5 star.
@ChrisStirewalt  Make America great again  and you people out there that want all this crazy cheap labor for your company's in your homes grow up, and start becoming Americans again and not jerks.
@ChrisStirewalt  Apple should be building big companies in the areas of our poor people. But let's face it these companies have become so used to having slave cheap labor that now facing the American citizens and decent wage is so painful to them.
@ChrisStirewalt  When you see your community dying because they once had jobs and now they're gone overseas. When they had injuries from those jobs. But now  don't have medical and they end up on drugs on the street and end up dying. everyone in this country should be ashamed.
@ChrisStirewalt  People seem like they don't understand why we voted for trump. were tired of people in the Dem Party that pull this kind of nonsense.  shame us into shutting up and sitting down  white poor in America is just as important as all the other poor.
@ChrisStirewalt  I understand what globalism is it's another way of having slaves.  but paying them practically nothing no medical no dental no 401k less than a buck a day. Shame on people that supported their families on the blood and Sweat of the poor of other.
@ChrisStirewalt  Everybody wants to make money everybody wants to have money to enjoy their lives. To help their children but if we only look at people at the border an Africa and other poor countries and we never look at what is happening in America then we are all to blame.
@ChrisStirewalt a nevertrumper a loyalist to Globalist is not right. There are poor that have no way to education to get better then a blue collar work. Chris, American citizens are hurting. how does someone like Mitt Romney help people in  Africa but no  white  America poor.
When the tea party pushed back they were trashed. When the hate Trump pushed back they were all  Glorified and pushed forward. The tea party is more anger and are more awake. They aren't his base they are the forgotten and Trump or not the dems better wake up.
@MaElviraSalazar  Maybe those people that come here and do blue collar work maids cooks busboys things like that meat packers maybe they should stay in their own country and straighten out their government and maybe they could have another American and not  hurting our country.
@MaElviraSalazar  So when people come here from other countries illegally and take our jobs and they go back to their country it hurts our country America's not a big social program for the poor of other countries.
@MaElviraSalazar  my 3 daughters yeah they tried to get jobs and you know what it was really hard for them because so many illegals  took the jobs for people that didn't have a high school  yet because they were still in high school.
@MaElviraSalazar   I got  straight back in 1971 when I worked at the IHP and  illegals that were busboys and cooks and dishwashers. I asked my boss if my friend from high school  to  help his mother could have a job  he said no we only hire illegals in back.
@MittRomney  You are so out of touch with the American people you don't even know what's going on in our country that is sad part. Maybe like a Warren you should open up a bottle of beer and pretend you're like cool with everybody  hard working and blue collar
@MittRomney  When I watch the today  and I saw the way you collapsed all I could think of  are you throwing the race is that why you don't stand up for yourself and fight back against this liar Obama that wants socialism in our country.
@MittRomney  You have no chance of winning no one thinks that you can get more votes and that is only going to hurt trump in the long run why don't you grow up and become in a visor and help him and stop  being a hypocrite.
@MittRomney  Everyone knows that democrats are bullies and so that is why we picked trump because he knows how to play their game and win and the United States right now needs a win because if those democrats take back the power we are all going to be in trouble and you know it.
@MittRomney  In The Bible it says simple no religion and no messiah comes after Jesus Christ you think people are stupid and don't know this. Hollywood dems and never trumpers have destroyed this country and we are sick of it. You had a chance you lost.
@MittRomney  Trump did not betray America he betrayed Hollywood and that is why they are so angry with him. If Harvey Weinstein is their God  means the movies must be their Bible and their disciples the media and the talk shows and everybody sees it and you allowed it.
@MittRomney  You were a coward when it came to Obama.  the United States gop conservative party we saw that when you allowed Obama to win. As did McCain when we were ashamed of you because you are a coward.
@mbalter truth is  a funny thing no matter how hard you try it seems to keep pushing to be told. Only evil seems to stand in way.
@joshua_harder our cops shouldn't be killed by illegals, they are already fighting gangs. That  we have let take over to many cities. I'm shame I was dem and watched the south bay become  so dangerous. I voted Trump. Many did for this reason.
@shailenewoodley  Do you honestly think that Exxon and them are the badd guys are you serious about this. You don't see China being the bag guy here.
@SenatorUtopia  Van Jones wants to make money off green energy and what people think we're so stupid we don't get this. He wants to be Chevron.
@SenatorUtopia  what it is. is the world wants americae tax payers  the hard workers of the world. to give their money up to these countries that are so corrupt it isn't funny. we're sick of it taxpayers are sick of it.
@SenatorUtopia  I cannot believe van Jones just said and get to meet movie stars what is wrong with you democrats are you this lame.
@davecatanese When you try to get   Glory by lying who you are it's time for you to go away.
@AlexWitt  . The biggest reason people want the wall and not just added border guards or some cameras. is because once it's no longer in the news, they fire the border guards and the cameras are not updated and we're right back where we were.
@AlexWitt  What you just said trump is coming down to try to meet the democrats the democrats are doing nothing to try to meet trump.
@AlexWitt  If we to not take border security serious we are all losers in this.
@AlexWitt  It isn't compassion when you make the American citizens 2nd to the people that are poor in the other parts of the world. we cannot take everybody that is fantasy.
@AlexWitt  Your guess just said a mouthful if the buck stops at the oval office then where in the world was Obama during Benghazi.
@AlexWitt Brain Kolfage's GoFundMe wall. He's a hero, he understands how important it is to keep America save. He's done his part. Let's all us help him do this.	We have to stand beside our hero's they paid for our freedom. If msnbc can't their hate is more about them.
@AlexWitt  Nancy Pelosi would  sell out the country to keep her position because of her husband which is also a business man that gets a lot of kickbacks because of who she is.
@AlexWitt. You guys this is serious we want the wall we're not going to back down on this.
@AlexWitt  And the only people that are turning on trump are the same old people that have been doing it forever. And a lot of the reason that you have gained more people is because CNN really did stop attacking trump a lot more than you guys do.
@AlexWitt  President trump didn't destroy general Flynn that was the FBI because of their insurance policy. President trump has promised to get us out of all these wars that have gone on too long.
@AlexWitt love the count down clock it show real bias with you loving on the Obama's and the hate for Trump.
@AlexWitt not only are people watching msnbc but talking about it. So keep it up. We need you to keep attacking Trump. It will help him win in 2020.
@JimCarrey  You were so so Actor and you're a so so cartoonist.
@JimCarrey  Trump didn't betray America he betrayed Hollywood and that's why you guys hate him. Obama  betrayed America and that is why Hollywood loves him
@AliVelshi  When hating trump is all the dems have they have nothing for the American citizens.
@AliVelshi Trump sever for free who that attacks him is willing to.
@AliVelshi   great solution all past  presidents Cut their pay out and give it to all of the poor countries. All of the dems that constantly back the illegals take away their pay and give it to the poor of the world put your money where your mouth is.
@AliVelshi  For these people that back the illegal that come to our country and say give us more  money for these countries and take their poor. Want to destroy America.
@AliVelshi  You people that will not see how to help the American citizens Are there reason that we voted for trump because we no longer can deal with the elites that deal with stuff like you're dealing with.
@AliVelshi   Washington State there are families with babies living in cars and tents. because they've lost their jobs because of illegals driving down the wages and taking away their jobs.  now they can't even get food stamps or welfare because they have no address.
@AliVelshi  This people that come to our borders dragged their children across a dangerous terrain.  then when they get here America is to blame for the conditions how insane is this.
@AliVelshi Trump didn't betray America he betrayed Hollywood and that's who your backing. Shame on you. They want cheap labor and your  helping them.
@AliVelshi stop calling Trumps and his people liars only make a fool of you.we who see the gangs coming in. We who see the danger these monster use kids are real. And that's why Trump won. Your the liars.
@KatyTurNBC  I'm really shocked that Dan rather is gets to say anything after being busted for lying.  So what he believes in the weather changing so what. We can't put the genie back in the bottle we better learn to adapt.
@KatyTurNBC  People say that dem party won that is why the stock market is tanking because dems are not good for business.
@KatyTurNBC Trump didn't betray America he betrayed Hollywood and their god was Harvey Weinstein. their bible are  their movies their  Disciples are them that work to bring down Trump. The call has gone out, the people are silently waking up. No polls just seeing the truth.
@KatyTurNBC his past his taxes his wifes shoes his youngest son. But look what they want for America they want open borders higher taxes and to fire ice. Sounds like the old ways of destroying our country and it's people have gotten a foot hold again.
@KatyTurNBC  Everyone says that the reason that the stock market is starting to tank. is because the dems won says a lot about the dems doesn't it. Oh and they hate Trump, and ones in office they hire lawyers to hurt Trump. Sad.
@PaulCallan dems hire lawyer to go after Trumps taxes. Dems spend money to hurt Trump. Really this is their goal to help the citizens of our country. Now we get why the stock is tanking. Sad. Dems need to stop.
@JenSaidIt many say the stock is tanking because the dems won. Sad they make that many fearful of what dems will do. But when you all you got is hate Trump.
@JenSaidIt wishing your country to lose is so sick. Why would dems want this. Says more about the party then it does about Trump.
@KeithOlbermann  Yeah you go ahead and believe that.
@jimmykimmel  You actually criticize trump after you were on The Man Show what a jerk. You call trump supporters meth heads by  the way the you act.
@jimmykimmel  You have no talent no looks. How did you get on tv. God must be disgusted with you because of the way that you treat your country.
@nachoaguilar  So people that voted for trump and want the wall aren't trying to be cold hearted but we're just sick and tired of seeing are  poor American citizens having a really rough time because someone is using up all of the social programs.
@nachoaguilar  Now why do you think  illegal get on those programs. Because people will hire them to do the jobs  pay half and no insurance and no taxes..  illegal will lie to the owerns and have  five-and-ten people living in one house but they have an address.
@nachoaguilar  Now you're probably wondering why is that when we have all these social programs.  because if you don't have an address you don't get any of those programs.
@nachoaguilar  So when I see somebody sitting on a bus stop at Christmas time. I think to myself that's a bus stop, there's a family in a tent in  like 20 degrees living in A-tent for the winner. Babies no homes no heat.
@nachoaguilar  Because American companies probably the ones that hate trump guess who they hire under-the-table illegals for  they don't have to pay taxes or insurance.
@nachoaguilar  I live up in Washington State and I see entire American citizen families living in cars and tents in winter it's cold very very cold. Many lose their jobs and businesses becaues. Your going to love this part.
@nachoaguilar  But I tell you something I think you're right we should get rid of all  programs all of them no free schools no free anything you want it you have to pay for it. just like it was in the days when the  Irish came here.
@nachoaguilar  you not understand these parents drag their kids  crossed all these countries to break into America. because we give free stuff to people out of our tax money.  your saying the worst thing that's ever happened to them is they were dropped off at a bus station.
Chuck todd.  The trump supporters see that all you people get your marching orders from Hollywood and the dems.
@chucktodd  You're right we should have let China continue ripping us off we should have continued lst  Canada and Mexico rip us off we should continue down the same old path that were on. Let people into our country that run our wages down that's the way dems look at things.
@chucktodd  If I had one thing to tell dems the more you attack trump the more trump supporters will feel attacked as well and they will vote again for trump
@chucktodd  In the past all of the never trumpers constantly took defeat and stepped back. Obama had every right to say he got  hurt  60 seats lost. Barely 30 seats were lost under Trump.
@NicolleDWallace  If I was to say one thing to the dems the more you attack trump the more powerful he becomes with his supporters. Becaues they hate Obama and feel they are being attacked as well.
@NicolleDWallace  O'Rourke.  Tries to come off like a conservative because he used to be one to try to get in as a dem. You do not fall in love with your plumber you do not fall in love with your electrician because if you do boy are you gonna get in trouble.
@NicolleDWallace  I can't even imagine what it would be like if Joe Biden became president of the United States. This is a man that seriously the dems needed think twice about.
@NicolleDWallace  Whatever happened to the days when we had an election and then we came together. it seems like every sense Clinton was in office and Obama that is disappeared.
@NicolleDWallace  There was a lot of people that hated Obama with a Passion. but most to them were just citizens of the United States. When media and talk shows and Hollywood hate trump it's not really the same thing.  Hes made it pretty rough from this semi rich.
@NicolleDWallace  Are you aware he did not make his billions on a talk show, that he actually made it on really state. And just because some democrats are acting like conservatives doesn't mean they get voted in liars	are liars.
@JessicaTarlov  Did you just brag about Nancy Pelosi rolling in. You do mean the person that said that MS and 13 has a spark of divinity right you know the people that  Slaughtered 2 little girls to death that's your leadership sad.
@JessicaTarlov when it came out that cnn msnbc an talk shows get their marching orders from chuck schumer. We all woke up. The word is Propaganda.
@JessicaTarlov you got to be kidding  cortez! She not only lies but she a joke. She is what they paint Trump.
@JessicaTarlov dems went to far with no wall, saying ms13 was God children Nancy Pelosi remarks. I guess the only way, would be getting to work and showing us you love the real citizens. Stand for something American not the world nonsense.	Because the world doesn't care about us.
@JessicaTarlov. Trump supporters hate Hollywood hate geroge soroa and Bill Ayers. The black mask wearing haters sealed the hate when you dems  supported them. So no matter who you run. even if you Pretend that you have more  Conservative values you will not win.
@JessicaTarlov  And by the way most people that voted for trump are not deplorable. And we are quite aware that people like George Soros is hurting the stock market. And another reason we look down on dems down for letting  this happen.
@JessicaTarlov  And about the president Pulling out of Syria have you seen our debt we no longer can rebuild other countries do not see this are you really this blind.
@JessicaTarlov  You do not say this about a president. What is wrong with you Dem Obama isn't president anymore stop being a loyalist to the king it's disgusting.
@JessicaTarlov  I do not watch CNN and MSNBC anymore I used to. but I just simply cannot take any station constantly degrades the president anymore. Any Fox had done this to Obama I would have said something which I did.  Harping you said our president was harping...
@Jehmu  How do you vote for a party that I once worked so hard for with Jimmy Carter. that only has these  thing taxes illegals and hate trump.
@Jehmu  This is not a new idea go fund me account to build the wall it has been talked about way even before Trump. But as usual democrats and never trumpers never listen to us.
@Jehmu  Democrats could not figure out why it was that so many people voted for trump. this is one of the reasons you guys need to wake up.
@Jehmu  When we cannot see that college kids and  high school kids need these jobs. to help support not only themselves but their families. we give them to illegals that send the money back to their families in Mexico and other places it's wrong.
@Jehmu  So many of my male friends in those days begged me to try to get them jobs where I worked and my bosses absolutely refused think that's fair.
@Jehmu  I have an one of those people my friends were 1 of those people back in 1970. I was lucky they hired waitresses to deal with the public that were citizens but they hired illegals for everything else in the back of the restaurants.
@Jehmu build the wall we no longer can let rich use cheap workers over our citizens.  back  1970 we seen this. It's heartbreaking there are so many families that can not afford to send their kids to college that need these jobs. These jobs  help the college kids pay for books.
@POTUS  They say you might not run in 2020, no one would blame you after all they done. But if not you who..
@POTUS  Dear president  so disappointed with president Bush if he would have only stood with you I would have been proud. But when he seems to stand with Obama after all that Obama's said about him I was really disappointed.his words we have one president at a time Hollow words.
@RepSwalwell you shut it down over the DACA but our citizens not worth it right. But then DACA would vote for your free stuff, not real citizens. Maybe crazy brainwashed that you got believing in your plan. Sad. You may have forgotten but you work for us. Trump won.
@RepSwalwell shame on you.
@RepSwalwell Trump is leading. But you dems nevertrumper Hollywood media talk shows have been seen for who you are. TRUMP supporters are sick of the dance. Build the wall, if we have to well build it our selves.
@SenBobCorker  Why are you not voting for the wall. Vote for the wall we are sick of it. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck schumer shut down the government over illegal.
@JulianEpstein  Working in Canoga park in Los Angeles with illegals Mexican was harder. Then working in Inglewood ca, with, Crips a very nasty gang. I trusted them more with my saved.
@JulianEpstein  Since 1971 I have seen the jobs for  college kids high school kids be taken away by illegals that do not speak any English. I've had to work with them and I'll tell you something it is not easy to work with these people when they do not speak any English.
@JulianEpstein  This is getting to be ridiculous you know this is wrong but the democrats and Hollywood in the media and never trumpers are all one party and we know whet we see it and we're sick of you. It's not just vista overstays. The Wanted be rich want slaves.
@JulianEpstein  We wasted our money on 700' of fencing what was the point of fencing. really why don't we just all hand them food stamps and welfare  as they step into America give me a break. Build the wall or the next person we vote in after 2024 will really up set you.
@RepGutierrez  And how you preach with fire of h*** down on us.  then turn around and were so impolite as to walk out while she was answering you. you work for us how much do you make, your not worth the money. I would fire you, if you worked for me.
@Clyburn  And by the way with somebody tell the other Democrat that Jesus wasn't fleeing for his life.
@Clyburn  And how do they get down on the other side after they climb that 14 foot  ladder. fall they would break their neck. Why do Hollywood have walls around  Their studio. Movie stars the White House Jews around Israel. Wall's work that's why China did it.
@RepGutierrez  And if you lost a loved one because  someone that came to this country that had been deported many times and he killed somebody in your family maybe then you'd understand but you have no empathy for them do you.
@RepGutierrez  And why is it that democrats and never trumpers and Hollywood only bring up The Bible and Jesus Christ and God. under these circumstances of bringing illegals into our country don't you find there to be old little repandant.
@RepGutierrez  And that's exactly what we do in this country when you go to jail we have to take your children away from you because they can't go to jail it happened under Obama's watch as well. Coming here against the law.
@RepGutierrez  And if you want to throw a talk show host  like Tucker Carlson up. you better take a good look at msnbc and CNN because the lies that they tell are disgusting. One said Trump isn't supposed to tell the people how to think that's our job. Morning joe mika.
@RepGutierrez  When the Irish and  the Italian's came to this country we didn't have social security we didn't have welfare we didn't have food stamps either they made or  they went home that is nots what's happening now and you know this.
@RepGutierrez  And the problem is our schools our hospitals our welfare or food stamps and so much else has been taken up by people that do not belong here in this country and you stand for them do not love this country at all the why are you in the government.
@RepGutierrez  And trust me on this one there was a lot of people under the Obama  that was laughing not only at Obama but the world was laughing at us. how could we have a president that wanted to  fundamentally change a country he loved.
@RepGutierrez  I guess it is that you never watch the news because guess what. there has been a lot of badd people that have come into our country illegally, that have murdered people so you might want to check that out.
@RepGutierrez  And when he was sworn in it would have been really nice if Hollywood didn't send out their minions. to block us threaten us and scare the hack out of our kids. for we couldn't see trump take the oath of office but then you're quite aware of this.
@RepGutierrez  And believe it or not and I know you don't trump has done more in the 2 years hes been in office then Obama did. but then he didn't lie to us  tell us we could keep our doctors and our insurance would go down.
@RepGutierrez  I know this is hard for you to understand but there's only 2 ways of pay for stuff and that's either you get a second job.  or you cut down on some things.that what  trump did when he made the deal with Canada and Mexico.
@SenatorCollins  The people that voted for trump are not angry were  disgusted at what has been going on in our government. But I am sorry if people attacked and made life miserable for you that should never be what happens.
@SenatorCollins  they  want to blame trump for this but this kind of attacks have been going on  before trump ever ran for president. It was  under Obama's  with the tea party we were constantly attacked even by our own government the IRS.
@SenatorCollins  Then I guess you understand what the people that work for trump has gone through because of Maxine waters Nancy Pelosi and Chuck schumer. Hollywood dems nevertrumper media talk shows have been doing this to all of Trump supporters.
@NancyPelosi  When trump said Nancy this is what transparency looks like you looked stunned and so did Chuck schumer. And Obama hired geitner for Treasury and he owed back taxes and you said below par how below par can  you get with this or how about Van Jones a truther.
@NancyPelosi  I think Nancy when you said we have to pass the bill to see what's in the bill I think that's when everybody just took a step that said this is insane what is the United States government .
@NancyPelosi  You're right our great country stood for everything it went through 8 years of Obama apologizing for the country and its people do you know how is shamed we were of that. And when they use the Iris against the tea party what did you expect.
@NancyPelosi  And how many people quit and ran away from the Obama administration you know it's not like we have short memories.	 Because we're tired of what is going on we know that the dems the never trumpers in Hollywood are all into the same party.
@NancyPelosi  And why would anyone after what Maxine waters and  the rest of you did. by calling out the dogs to go after people's wives husbands and children ever wanna work for trump's administration give me a break.
@NancyPelosi  Nancy you must think we are completely stupid we understand why you will not give trump the money. because he would have a win and you don't want that you don't want America to win you want democrats to win and that's disgusting.
@GregGutfeldShow  If trump has taught us one thing it isn't to act like Bush that said oh it's OK that Obama ran me down and  blame me for everything for 8 years now I'll be his wifes friend. And hate on Trump to be liked.
@GregGutfeldShow  I love your speech about forgiveness. the problem is that's the way conservatives have always felt. but unfortunately the dems Hollywood talk shows them never trumpers never have never will and so you get  looking like  wissey like Mitt Romney.
@gregg_re no, We Trump supporters are awhere what Trump has been up against.  It's not like Obama where you, Hollywood the media dems nevertrumper talk shows were all in on the game.
@SenFlakeStaff  Would you please tell everybody the truth that you're not really a conservative that you're really a dem just like Joe was on good morning Joe. American citizens frist, wall now.
@SenFlakeStaff  So let me see if I've got this straight if our military stay in a country we are badd people, if we leave a country were badd people.	 Why isn't ISIS in the news anymore. Because Trump has attacked and done the right thing where Obama never did.
@SenFlakeStaff  I hope you understand that when you stand with people on MSNBC and CNN and against trump. what you call us in the United States is deplorable,  and it's half of the United States and we will not be forgetting it.
@TheJuanWilliams  Isn't it weird how Hollywood has pretty much stopped smoking in movies and still there so much violence with guns..
@NancyPelosi you have any idea that you and  chuck will be blame by ever Trump supporters. So in away don't sign, that way will be a sure Trump wins 2020.	Were so sick of dems nevertrumper Hollywood the media and talk shows.
@HamillHimself  Harvey Weinstein is  Hollywood God. that means the movies must be your Bible.  that must mean the talk shows must be your disciples. Vegas is not Sin City Hollywood is, and everybody knows it.  But then you know that Roman Polanski better then anyone.
@HamillHimself Sad you jump on the  Trump hater train.. Trump didn't betray America like other presidents have in the past. he betrayed Hollywood and that's why you guys hate him so much.
@StefWKight  And I could tell you one sad story after another about American citizens. that have lost their homes lost their cars and even had their children taken from them because they've been living in cars.
@StefWKight the United States isn't set up for a welfare county for the world. We have a choice wall, or end all social programs as it was when the Irish came. But we can't do both.
@StefWKight  We were talking to one family. we asked how this happened to them. They told us he lost his business and home. Landscaping business. the ones hiring illegals ran him out of business. And his house was underwater.
@StefWKight  . I live in Washington State. There are families that live out in the woods in a tents and sleeping bags. The reason is because unless you have an address you can't get any social program help. People bring them coats and blankets in the winter time.
@MeganCerullo   it Obama that went golfing  the day that  news reporters was  beheaded.	  wasn't it Kerry that said you better go to college are you gonna end up in the military we couldn't find out where president Obama was when bengazi happened and 4 Americans were murdered.
@NancyPelosi  I just heard on TV just now, you absolutely refusing to help us pay for the wall. what is wrong with you? can you not see what's going on in our country, are you really this blind. More will vote Trump by doing this, not less. Be sure of this.
@TheJuanWilliams the mika remark you say comes from Trump what has he said compared to that. Liar. Bearing false witnesses is a sin a big sin.
@morningmika you don't for give others, you should not be  forgiven. fire her. Make her live her own standards. Or you people have no standards. What a shock. Dems are a sad lot. Now if Trump said that you really have a right to be up set.
@TheJuanWilliams dems have to step down from reason to defend dem way. Obama and Louis farrakhan pictures how dare you shame on you for not calling your side out.
@TheJuanWilliams nevertrumper dems no matter what color they are are one party bad.
@TheJuanWilliams your on the side of Trump lawyer that a new low even for a dem. But looks what low bar you and dems are going to set for the next dem president. It's your  doing don't cry about it when it happens.
@AriAramesh all I can say about tonight, did you learn your lessons from joe Biden, when he was  debating  with Paul Ryan. Does the word flimflam mean anything to you.	I was embarrassed for you.
Then maybe they should have acted like saints and the 1st place and run their game on socialism when it really is capitalism their work and so hard.
'The Obamas should not be criticised for making money. They're former politicians, not saints' https://t.co/m7Nyoxbdmt
@levenson_scott  A violent person smoking dope does not calm the person down and chill them out. I have seen them attack people when they have been smoking dope so please put your head in right.
@donlemon  ISIS they killed a reporter and president Obama he dropped flyers on isis members  trucks and said run away we are going to bomb your trucks. And then he actually went High fiving his friends and golfing after an American reporter was behead.
@donlemon  Maybe if the 1st lady Obama didn't act so money hungry she would have written a book like that about trump. and then she wouldn't have to feel awkward but money seems to be all that the obamas are intrested in.
@donlemon  He took his coat off like a mafia don. You are aware that president Obama  had thugs literal thugs at the White House right what is wrong with you. Real gangster
@donlemon  And the clintons didn't say a word to the carters as if they weren't even there. You  don't wanna mess with Hollywood democrats they're mean they're bullies. but then don  you know something about that your one.
@donlemon  Does anybody ever remember what was it that president Obama said and blamed on president Bush? Howe for 8 years everything that was wrong about the United States was president Bush's fault. So really it's not so much that the Obama's are gracious it's the Bush are.
@TheJuanWilliams watching you talk about Bush Sr. And trying to slam Trump. Falls very short after 8 years of Obama I'm so great thank me blame Bush Jr. And how bill Clinton treated Bush Sr was so bad.
@Tom_Winter NBC dig throught tapes to hurt Trump becaues he betrayed Hollywood. Harvey Weinstein was their God and the movies are their bible's.
@KenDilanianNBC  All the wishful thinking that you guys could possibly hope for is just never going to happen you do realize that right. When Hollywood  learns the American citizen are turning on them. They wake up.
@seanhannity   you said that conservatives have to get their own Tech companies. And they have to get their own comedian, talk shows. somebody over at the very rich end of this pool of conservatives have to start a new Hollywood. producing well made movies not just dirt and smat.
@NancyPelosi  You have to be aware that the dems barely won if you look at the numbers. That means that in 2020 it's going to be a lot worse. Either they stand for something because trying to destroy trump is not working.
@NancyPelosi  I do not think the dems understand  they go after president Trump. what will happen, because the people that voted for Trump are so angry with the dems right now. that any move that's illegal against him, would be taken as a very hosstyle act toward them personally.
@KenRoth I don't know which one I'm offended more by. when they maker president into a baby or they make our president into a monkey. I cannot believe that they do that stuff,   to a country that has done so much for the world. it is disgusting on both sides.
@GovRichardson  A community organizer had so much behind him working for him, covering stuff up for him. We get a business man, and they have done everything they can to bury him to hurt him to shame him. but he think that's about.
@GovRichardson  When  media  is only for one party and only 1 news outlet will actually hold the other party responsible for anything may do. it is no longer the bed rock of our societie, it is called corruption at his finest. when it's connected to Hollywood the talk shows.
@SteveColbert  Are you aware that you cannot hurt Trump or his supporters? We did not elect a president we hired a bully to go against the bullies like you. Becaues Mitt Romney was a coward that let them walk on him. He was fearful of you guys. Trumps like you.
@PaulaReidCBS  The picture of Obama and Louis Farrakhan. Where was president Obama during bengazi. How come no one wants to touch these questions. For 8 years they beat up Bush. Not one question for Obama, odd. The  news is own by dems that's why, an everyone see it.
@K_Schallhorn   No alimony no child support.  Did the I could to take care of my 3 daughters. Couldn't afford another a lawyer  I had hired two that did nothing for me to get divorced.  judge actually cited with my ex husband in our divorce because it had been 26 years.
@JessicaTarlov  I was a Democrat I did a lot to get  Carter elected. I don't understand the democrats today. how do you work for a party that called half of the United States deplorable. but still stands up for the illegal immigrants that try to force their way into our country.
@OutnumberedFNC  Numbers of USA On YouTube check out immigration simplified. Why is it no one understands this it is extremely simple. Maybe you guys should put it on Fox every day and maybe stupid people can understand it.
@OutnumberedFNC  I don't seem to get it. maybe someone they're smarter than me can  make me understand it. so  Clinton's emails being exposed was bad. But it was OK For NBC to release a very old tape of trump and another man talking in private. What...
@BradMossEsq  Did you just call trump a juvenile you don't think that Obama was acting juvenile when he said the cops acted foolishly. And I could give you many examples where Obama acted very juvenile like against Fox News.
@cindyhydesmith  Do us a favor over on the GOP side  stop  giving the dems more to weapons against us. their head hunting us, don't help them. Now see that could be Racist  against cannibals. Ever word we say is weight and measure. Not so much on their side.
We have elections in this country and once the election is over. We are supposed to come together as a country, and that's not what happens. Being news means being critical of both sides do not fond over Obama and attacked Trump.
@CNNPolitics
@CNNPolitics  It makes me sick to my stomach to see the head or used to be head of the CIA be in the pocket of the Dem Party that is not how our government is supposed to work.
@CNNPolitics  When trump says that certain news outlets is the enemy of the people. he is saying if you guys don't knock it off and stopped being the left propaganda machine. you're not helping the United States be bias.
@CNNPolitics  But people tell me all the time, leave them be. they are their worst enemy, if they think they're helping the dem party they're not, they're helping trump.
@CNNPolitics  It's not that trump supporters get upset with Cnn  for telling the truth it's when they constantly take trump out of contents and then put that smirk on their face.
@SenBillNelson  And to be so up noxious about the word  nationalism stands for it sure doesn't stand for globalism and that's exactly which you guys want.
@SenBillNelson  I used to be a liberal and it broke my heart to have to walk away from a party that is literally turned into what you have turned it into. When free speech and taking our guns  and hating trump is all you guys have to stand on you stand on nothing.
@SenBillNelson  When the dems can start acting more civil like Maxine waters calling on people to harass people at their homes their jobs and at their children school you're right civility should start in your party.
@SenBillNelson  Civility are you kidding me you have got to be  the Democratic Party call people that voted for trump deplorable. The only time the trump has ever said anything is to hit back because hes not a coward like McCain and Mitt Romney and he doesn't roll over like Bush.
@Ocasio2018 please don't try turning America in to Venezuela.  Will are not socialist we are Capitalist. Hope being in our government will help you grow up.
@JoeNBC No joe it wasn't Pelosi, it was the 24 hour Propaganda to teach them to hate Trump. Becaues you people want  globalism and you used them to do it. If you get your way they see what you did to America and their lives. Shame on you.
@kyrstensinema Poor Arizona
@TheJuanWilliams  About the skit on Saturday night live saying who else does that you ask. The dems Hollywood media talk show about gop way way before Trump. So can't take it dems can you. Get use to it.
@LawProfButler  And believe me back in 1970 in the San Fernando Valley my friends could tell you horror stories. Abuse we were put throught. No one ever talks about	We were white.
@LawProfButler  I am not sure that this is a race think. I think the problem is  the cops are not getting  good enough training psychologically. No stories every   told how whites are treated. The two black cops that shot and kid a 9 year white kid with autism.
your on hardball   read  what made you a black man. I have been listening to this kind of stuff for a long time I am a white woman. when I was 18, I was arrested by the LAPD they slammed me up against the bars they threw me in with a crazy woman.
@LawProfButler
@TuckerCarlson also giving a child up is not like giving a puppy up. So stop judging and understand why these very hard laws were made.
@TuckerCarlson I may not agree with much of the dems. But the courts have ruled on abortion and  same sex marriage. So let's not keep trying to change it. You and your guess laughed about women having fewer kids is better for the other kids. Where do you find this funny.
@JeffFlake so run as a dem
@JeffFlake are  you even awhere what kind of  dems that follow your Twitter
@RepMcSally  Keep fighting for us we need every GOP we can get to fight against what's coming at American. Thank you for running.
@kyrstensinema  More lost ballots.
@TheView President Obama went after a reporter's so badly James rosen that he had his entire family wiretapped and investigate it. How soon we forget.
@TheView But propaganda has to have power to really work and you can't get any bigger power then Hollywood the media talk shows. They have literally throwing the entire bowl of spaghetti at the wall and hope something with stick and president trump. Obama lost both houses.
@TheView https://t.co/K5rIepnsB9
@ShannonBream  The female that was on your show I did not catch her name. for her to say what  she said that it was Russian like or Kremlin like  applies to Russia to trump was disgusting. Where was she with Obama and James rosen that was Russia like.
@TuckerCarlson  I just read what  those thugs did at your home hang in there Tucker keep spreading the word we are with you we understand that this is scary nazis are scary.
@axlrose Watch the death of a nation wake up.
@axlrose You suck. Megaphones for the dems are loud. How much do you pay your help...
@komonews  For me to the tip over danger should also included the stoves
@AliVelshi  Well at least we had a couple of years things being  hot and things were actually doing great in America. So dems  take it away do you worst. Where job will be down companies will leave wages will drop. But crime will go up and we keep heading to the wall.
@AliVelshi  Delivery us back into the same people that will raise our taxes and allow illegals to run down wages. But let's face it that's good for you and the people in Hollywood right.
@AliVelshi  Yes when we vote on that day the government will be run by people that you did everything you could to make them hate trump but is that really your job?
@AliVelshi  1st I look at the stock market ans I no thank you guys are got to be behind this kind of nonsense	 then the 1st thing out of your mouth is to slam trump are you working hard for the Democratic Party are you proud of yourself not being a reporter.
Drunk
@contessabrewer  OK I just found the answer to my question your a pisces that answers a lot. I am so sorry for my comment.  my daughters is a  pisces I understand you need to use your filter more. But your a good person.
@contessabrewer  Did you just say you didn't even try to take our coffee order?  I'm still asking the same stupid question what was that thing about the guns and the guy in the white shirt.
@TheJuanWilliams a big Trump supporter send bombs you said!dems supporter hunted down and shot and almost killed a congressman. Shot cops, you need to think about this.
@jonstewartbooks when you hit Trump he hits back. Doesn't stand there with sand in their face. So the hateful side of the dems their personal megaphone Hollywood gets really mad. Dems act all above it but they have an attack dogs Hollywood talk shows.
When you ask Trump to stop getting back in people's faces. May be you can ask the biggest bully of all  that are  the mouth piece of the dem party  Hollywood. Must be nice to act all above it, when Hollywood the media talk show are your hate Mongers. How blind
@Trevornoah no one fearful of these people coming they don't need people working for less driving down wages as a millionaire you don't get this.
@sherricaputo22 @mjmkatz @JoeNBC Then what would the dems to
@JoeNBC What is wrong with you joe have lost your mind.
@TheView    Bill Clinton standing with this piece of felt Louis https://t.co/kZ6AJtBbeL was president Obama in a picture with this piece of filth. if that had been trump with David Duke he would not be president to day and no one would speak so elegantly about him.
@TheView  I would like to know why it is that Louis farrakhan  was brought up by McCain and then no one spoke a word. the man called the Jews termites are you kidding me, and then you see Bill Clinton and the rest of I'm standing with this piece of filth Louis Farrakhan.
@TheJuanWilliams  the people with a heart have to realize why Hollywood is doing this they're doing it because they want to use these people as slave labor and trump wants to stop and.
@TheJuanWilliams  The other reason that Obama doesn't have to go after the dark side of politics is because he has Hollywood that does it for him. just like for Clinton when you have got bigger megaphone screaming at the people you can sit back and just be sweetheart.
@TheJuanWilliams  You believe that Obama did the hope and changey thing  actually what he did is he turned a lot of people against police officers  said that people clingvto their guns and their Bible and could not accept change and then mrs Clinton called them deplorable us
@TheJuanWilliams   My 18  grandson see it better than you can and that is really sad please. someone over at  your party needs to say the truth for a change. All the shooting under Obama is his  faults? Or does that game you play doesn't work both ways.
@TheJuanWilliams    trump has  done something that the dems have never seen before. Hev actually fight back as dirty as they do.  didn't you expect it to happen one  day if the dems to not back off.	But instead of them backing off, they blame him for behaving as bad as they do
@McFaul  And where were you when Obama was all googly eyed over Cuba and iran.
@McFaul  Have you forgotten the reason that they actually stopped on Americans adopting their children. was because some moron woman decided to send a child after she had had it for several years back to Russia, really you don't remember.
@Lawrence  Maybe instead a having Putin the Russian president over to the White House. maybe we should send a iran  more money like Obama did.
@BarackObama  hearing that when McCain was running against you a woman said something really ugly things about  you. he stopped her. Why don't you do this same or asked to have the same done when someone goes off on president trump and his family. why don't you set them straight.
@jonathanalter  Vice president Biden saying we need to lower the temperature he wanted to take the president out back and beat the h*** out of him he said they're going to keep you in chains where does he get off why don't you stop and think about what you're saying
@jonathanalter  The left has gotten away with this kind of tactics for way over 40 years it's ridiculous it's pathetic and it no longer works with the public the American people are awake.
@jonathanalter  The only way this stops is when you guys call off your dogs. If they keep attacking the reit the right has no choice but to fight back and that's all that they're doing.
@jonathanalter  McCain stopped a woman from saying something very ugly about president Obama. When was the last time you saw someone on the left stopping someone from saying something ugly about president trump it doesn't happen does it.
@Lawrence  The left actually things by pulling this stuff by following people into restaurants in bathrooms and into the kids as schools and . Harassing people on planes that they're going to get somewhere they're not is just going to get worse call your dogs off.
@Lawrence  If you want the right to backup your best bet is to tell the clowns on the left to stop acting like clowns.
@Lawrence  It's just gotten to the point that they just don't trust the left at all they think the left is capable of anything because they done everything.
@Lawrence  So I'm watching you on his show tonight and I will tell you something you sound ridiculous it isn't the right doing this look at what they put the judge throught  tell the truth
@matthewamiller  You mean what's been happening in this country for the last 40 years. yeah the left has been  control. and now the right is getting to be as ridiculous as the left. But what did you expect.
@matthewamiller  tonight I heard someone say over on MSNBC that McCain stopped a woman for saying something ugly about president Obama. You will never see that when someone is saying something ugly about president Trump. It just shows there's more class on the right than the left
@CNNLIVE_ https://t.co/owCJKzgaCW
@JoelMartinRubin this is from the left. Louis farrakhan calling them termites cause this. https://t.co/6e8ez12x6d
@JoelMartinRubin  Call out the people on the left call them  off and tell them  what they did by chasing people out of restaurants and attacking them  at their home is what caused all of this.
@JoelMartinRubin  What bothers people to day is that for so many years the democrats have been played  this awful game and now trump is playing  it and you guys are not happy.
@JoelMartinRubin  Louis farrakhan called them termites the other day you said nothing.
@JoelMartinRubin   seriously want to blame president trump for this and shut him down for you guys have an actual chance to win. But people are awake and they see what you guys on the left have been doing chasing people at a restaurants and terrorizing them at the gas pump.
@JSchanzer  Could it possibly be something to do with the picture of Louis farrakhan and president Obama. Tapping down the hate speech may be coming from the left more. Did you not see this. https://t.co/Ubm6IpTPcd
@JSchanzer  It was kind of interesting today on Fox how you went right to the right so fast. And still the other day it was Louis Farrakhan that call Jews termites and he is not from the right by any means but you didn't even mention his name that seems odd don't you think.
@JoeNBC  You know what makes you a coward Joe that the other day Louis farrakhan call the Jewish people termites and you say nothing.
@realDonaldTrump Louis farrakhan called them termites the other day cnn and MSNBC says nothing about that man. Because of the picture with Obama
@AnaCabrera  When people say make America great again what they're talking about is their tired of the dirty games the left plays. Then blame the right for playing the same game.
@AnaCabrera  You know what people are getting sick of how it become something like.  like the judge and all of a sudden all this weird stuff happens right before the vote. that's why you're scary guys that's why nobody likes you you're scary.
@AnaCabrera  Yes  hatred toward Jewish people like Louis farrakhan that call them termites the other day and if that had been a conservative you  have been wall-to-wall coverage but because he was taking a picture with president Obama you  say nothing yet cowards
@cnni  Louis farrakhan called the Jewish people the other day termites so when there was a shooting at the synagogue and they blame who not Louis of course because he was seen with president Obama in a picture
Louis farrakhan called them termites.  In new york they put up pictures of a women holding a bible called her trash. No respect for faith anymore on the left. https://t.co/NUP2SZ5Bls
You talk about how president trump needs to tap down his rhetoric go to  YouTube put in Louis farrakhan and here the  insanity that this man teaches to his people.
Louis farrakhan is a David Duke and Obama picture with this monster is why you say nothing.
Louis farrakhan just called Jews termites. If this had been a conservative that said this it would be wall-to-wall coverage but you will not say a word because you're cowards and afraid of Louis.
@AriMelber  With this last shooting at the synagogue I can guarantee you guys will not even mention that Louis farrakhan called Jews termites. if it had been president trump that had said this it would be wall-to-wall coverage you are cowards
@davidgura  What if  president trump or anyone in the GOP ever called Jewish people termites. it would be wall-to-wall coverage and still you allow this joke of a person called Louis farrakhan to get off the hook and you never mention it what you afraid of him
@davidgura  . When president trump talks about. George soros hes not talking about Jews hes talking about the ridiculous man this man is.
@davidgura  Louis farrakhan called Jews termites. You liars
@davidgura
@davidgura Louis farrakhan called them termites. And by the way the man that is speaking on your show right now. I agree with him  bill Ayres is not a . Domestic terrorism he is a terrorist and he was friends with president Obama.
@davidgura  With this shooting at the synagogue   why are you not freaking out and calling louis farrakhan out since he  just call them  termites the other. You blame Trump.
@HuffPost we never fought back. Hollywood media megaphone talk shows stars singers all did low dirted attacks. But gleen beck, the tea party. Many found their  voice. Then Trump came along. Said talk back call them out. Now you shame us!  You done this forever.
@ScottMinerd 401K hurting
@HardballChris  Could they have pick somebody that was more obvious.
@HardballChris  So it didn't work all you've done is make your base a little crazier. And the next time somebody hunts a Congressman down like they did it's your fault you Chris it's your fault it's your fault dems it's your fault take responsibility for what your doing.
@HardballChris  It was too close to November this was completely a set up everybody knows it you guys can Bang the pots together all you want and the only thing you've done is make people think you're more crazy than you are
@HardballChris  Looking at this guy's family in his raps sheet. This is a guy that would make a deal with some very on savory people to make trump look bad.
You wanna talk about trump's bad behavior look no farther than the clintons they were accused not of grabbing somebody but of rape that's your party Harvey Weinstein Obama's daughter was going to work for him.
@AriMelber  If you like your doctor you can keep your doctor that was a lie you are aware our insurance have gone through the roof.
@AriMelber  People are sick and tired of the democrats never trumpers Hollywood the lying media the talk shows and the protesters that hit our cars and scare the h*** out of our kids.
@AriMelber  So before you start again with the hate trump and hate trump supporters you better look in your own backyard because if you think we're not voting for trump because of what you're doing right now you are kidding yourself.
@AriMelber   freeways blocked people trying to get to their children getting out his school.  alone in front of the school not knowing what is happening. There were women that were ready to give birth their husband racing to the hospitals and these protesters stood in the way.
@AriMelber  So now you wanna cry about it now that they've stopped us on the freeways with protesters hitting our cars scaring the h*** out of our children.
@AriMelber  She called us deplorable. Dems have play dirty sending their minions out to attack trump supporters before he became president at the rallies. And under Obama the police officers were being targeted and murdered because Obama said the cops acted stupidly.
@PhilippeReines but the sad thing its what  you guys want you don't care at all about America.
@PhilippeReines a congressman was shot. Almost killed. Do you not get this. How nuts are dems.
@PhilippeReines you nail it. Being mistreated in a restaurant over being send a bomb thats not going to go off. Come on thats all you dems have got. What nut thought that would fly. You are awhere every one thinks its the dems right that did it?
America first, her  vets  and her poor.
@TheView  And by the way we will be voting but not for who you think we should. You work for Hollywood.  The globeless crazies.
@TheView  When you have someone like Clinton and Maxine waters and all the other crazies on the left calling for violence and chasing people out of restaurants and harassing them at home and you turn this around that somehow this is trump's people doing this come on.
@TheView  Does the word being obvious, Mean nothing to you frist the judge then the border now this come on. This looks like a very badly written story from a five-and-dime paper back novel.
@TheView  Most of the people today are saying with this whole scare on George Soros and Clinton and the others is nothing but a set up by them to try to get people to see that trumps a badd guy not working.
@TheView  You must think America's citizens are all on drugs to believe the propaganda you people put out.
@TheView  You will have to go all the way back when president trump was  just running for president. And seeing how a 14 year old boy was chased down and beat up by the left.
@paulkrugman What cave  sir do you live in that you don't see the left being so out of control for so many years that you actually  blame the right.
@MTPDailyTweets  You know there's something wrong with your party when you have to pretend that you have the same ideals as the party you're running against to win.
@MTPDailyTweets  The only way the guy can win against Cruz is by acting like a conservative.
@MTPDailyTweets  This stuff has been going on all the way through to attack anyone that could possibly stand up against the democrats. But its over everyone sees your games. They just don't work anymore.
@MTPDailyTweets its bad when a president hopeful has to park their cars and walk across field to get to their rallies thats what Trump had to do. Explain that oneTodd.
@MTPDailyTweets you know when we know your lying when your mouth is moving.
@MTPDailyTweets shame on you guys
@MTPDailyTweets  Senator flake is a nevertrumper
@MTPDailyTweets  . Let's face it you and the rest of them work for the Democratic Party and your nothing but a propaganda machine
@MTPDailyTweets why don't you put together all the attacks from your shows all of msnbc hollywood actors talk show nevertrumper on Trump supporters and Trump. That would be your whole show. End it with the 14 year old being run down by a mob.
@MTPDailyTweets  A maybe president Obama president Bush and president Clinton should actually come out and say this is enough we don't act like this is a country stop attacking trump and his supporters this is sick but that's their only game is not.
@MTPDailyTweets  Maybe president Obama needs to backup his roll and stop attacking the trump administration.
@MTPDailyTweets  Add up all The Times that someone in the Democratic Party has been harassed then add up all The Times that the trump supporters and people that work with trump has been attack and there you have your numbers of truth.
@MTPDailyTweets   democrats are afraid of is how badd it is looked with the democrats constantly calling for  Harassmentand throw rocks and hurt people in the trump party and so you figured it turn it around and make it look like they're coming after you guys to it's not working.
@MTPDailyTweets  Now Todd why don't you tell the people the truth that the security that these people have in place are so high this would be absolutely ridiculous to get through. Inside job to say see Trump like Maxine water.
@MTPDailyTweets. This whole thing was phony baloney rigged by the democrats as usual wow the dems just never stopped do.
@MTPDailyTweets  And by the way with Debbie washerman scholtz how is that whole thing where she was  hiring a Middle East person and his family to  hurt America how did that turn out you never talk about that do you.
@MTPDailyTweets  You know it used to be where the media actually spoke truth to power now what you do is carry water for very corrupt people. The money must be good. To buy  your conscience.
@MTPDailyTweets  Like that crazy lady on the plane that just freaked out on that poor kid wearing a hat R T-shirt of trump's and she had to be removed from the plane that's like the people behind you.
@MTPDailyTweets  I am watching your show right now and the people behind you where you are are scary looking.
@MTPDailyTweets  Is that where they came up with the idea.
@MTPDailyTweets  And it's really amazing how much little time you gave 2 things that were being sent to trump and pence.
@MTPDailyTweets  How do you guys even keep a straight face with this stuff.
@MTPDailyTweets  This whole thing that you guys are trying to push sounds like a badd dime store novel book very badly.
@MTPDailyTweets  and geroge soroa has so many enemies I have a feeling he even has a food taster.
@MTPDailyTweets  And the security that these people have for any one to get through would have to be an inside job. nobody's buying that some lunatic out there listening to trump is doing https://t.co/qz89qROdO4 the Vegas investigation going that blow up in your face  didn't it.
@MTPDailyTweets  we are  still waning on some kind of reporting from you where president Obama was when 4 men were being murdered in bengazi.
@MTPDailyTweets  All this is happening right before November you honestly think that anyone's buying this nonsense now right.
@MTPDailyTweets . Mr. Todd if anyone is to blame for these people now going after suppose  the top dems it would be your party. nobody is stupid enough to believe they're not doing it to themselves to get attention. like O hate trump he so  mean when it's Maxine waters.
@DeadlineWH  I guess what I'm trying to say is please MSNBC and CNN stop  making a joke of our country stop it. I am so tired of hearing how you guys look like a bunch of idiots. Its your names then hate Trump afterwards thats the joke.
@DeadlineWH  And if the democrats were so concerned about America's security why would president Obama give so much money to a country that has been known  to be a terrorist organization like Iran.
@DeadlineWH  And the people that are using the caravan for political. Are your party.
@DeadlineWH  I got a good headline for you Hey people look how we're trying to take down your 4o1k scare the h*** out a you about the border people by paying them to come to the border and now. all the world is falling apart really under Trump.
@DeadlineWH  I guess I am so sick and tired of turning on a channel like yours and hearing hate trump hate trump hate trump hate trump I mean get and new plan get a new montreux this is disgusting and beneath reporters. Now you sound like is propaganda machines.
@DeadlineWH  And if he actually want to do reporting why don't you find out where our president Obama was when Bengazi was going down.
@DeadlineWH  President Obama said we could keep our doctors that are insurance wouldn't go up. you wanna know what me and my friends are paying for insurance were not like you were not rich. He lied.
@DeadlineWH  And of course you guys went around to everybody in this 7000 people paid to March and asked them if they were at Middle Eastern give me a break.
@DeadlineWH  You should change the name at the of your show to anger house because that's where you are. you are not telling the people all the great things you could do for them you're just saying hate trump.
@DeadlineWH  I mean come on the judge thing didn't work all of the other insanity and now it's the border and supposedly now there's crazies attacking top dems really do you think anyone's buying this nonsense.
@DeadlineWH  But it no longer matters I think people are awake and seen what the democrats have done in the past and what they plan to do in the future and honestly they're just sick of you people.
@DeadlineWH  And lady I'm still so angry with you I cannot believe you did that to Mrs. Pailin and her family. you were supposed to help her but now it looks like McCain and the rest of you were just handing the race to Obama.
@DeadlineWH  I think what MSNBC and CNN and Hollywood the dems and nevertrumper need to wake up to. People are not the backward blind idiot they ones use to could play with their heads. They see your games.
@DeadlineWH  And trust me it's not the Russians that are doing this to us if there is a foreign country doing stuff to us that would be China. But what's really sad it's our own political people that are trying to hurt America to get back in power that's the sick part.
@DeadlineWH  And I'm sorry but it's hard to believe that crazies are doing this to George Soros and Clinton when they are the ones that conspire against people and use bleach bid and hammers to get rid evidence I mean seriously how do we take them seriously
@DeadlineWH  And I think with Hollywood and you guys and everyone else over on the left constantly calling to harass people you're the one that has upped everybody's crazy game to come after people so it's you to blame not trump.
@DeadlineWH  Did you just said trump was being friends with our enemies who do you think is Iran? Or bbf... that was Obama turning his back on Israeli and being all nice to the people who said death to America.
@StephenKing lying looks like you can keep your doctor's.
@StephenKing that pictures closes he knows where all the bodies are buried in Hollywood.
@StephenKing i should write a story about how Hollywood been really running the country. But lost to Trump, and he knowns where all the bodies are buried. And they are anger he was one of them. https://t.co/98GLHfz5Lb
@StephenKing Obama knew the truth of Benghazi he just didn't care. Like he didn't care when a reporter was beheaded. He went golfing.
@StephenKing Obama message was lead from behind, and hate people who don't think like you.
@JoeNBC How was that big meeting with geroge soroa and the dems nevertrumper Hollywood go. Are we seeing the big plan...
@JoeNBC Did these middle east jerks kill anyone under Obama. Or didn't they count.
@JoeNBC Joe tell Trump he not the one who tells the people what to think. Thats mika job remember lol.
The truth you can't says the truth. You  are bought and paid for. You repeat the lies your owners tell you to say. Or no more Hollywood partys for you.
@WarrenBuffett  Please whatever you think you guys are doing stop it. these are people's lives you're messing with, and if you think that hurting this stock market is going to hurt trump boy are you dumb. It will make people vote for him more.
@ShepNewsTeam  And yes people will Google the new killer treaty between Russia and America. They will also see how Russia has broken that deal many times. But the United States is the one that obeys it and you're OK with that.
@ShepNewsTeam  Why don't you just wear a sign around your neck I am owned by the Democratic Party.
@ShepNewsTeam  And you wanna talk about fear Mongrain that exactly what you do every day on your show about trump and it gets old stop it you look ridiculous.
@ShepNewsTeam  People get so tired of people like you Mr Smith telling them this nonsense. Like saying that trump is the one that's called for  all this on civil behavior when everybody knows is happening back in the days of Bill Clinton with democrats.
@ShepNewsTeam  And you know they are really badd people that are coming from these countries if your correct that there's this many badd people in those countries.
@ShepNewsTeam  If they're running from a country because they're so scared why don't they stop in the other 2 countries they come through.
@ShepNewsTeam  If they're running from a country that we keep giving money to don't you think we should stop giving money to that country.
@penn_teller   Each of us have to walk her own path.
@cw_charmed  If they stay away from political and political correctness the show's gonna really rock, if they don't, it's going to really suck.
@cw_charmed We just have to be careful of the brainwashing
@cw_charmed  I cannot believe he said that's how bricks happened... Breaks happen becaues they love their country. Brainwashing much.
@yasminv  When that rap singer did that video with the 1st lady I was happy you couldn't ask for better advertisement for trump. Now they really hate democrats.
@yasminv  Many of us since the seventies have been watching we are quite aware that you gotten into our schools we are quite aware you gotten into the media it doesn't matter. America is a raft not a ship we can take on a lot of water and bounce right backup.
@yasminv  Freedom does not mean that you have to accept someone else's craziness. that just their  craziness cannot go so far that it infringes on your rights. America is stronger then you think.
@yasminv  You know what's great about America a lot of riff raff and terrible people come and try to destroy the country. But a good wind and they blow away and our constitution and our bill of rights, right there that's what makes America.
@yasminv  What I find a sterical when I talk to people is that every time they flip on CNN or MSNBC.  they hear these clowns attacking trump they want to vote for conservatives and trump more it's funny.
@yasminv  And the only reason that Mr. And mrs Obama are still popular is cause the media makes them popular. Because if you started reporting the news and what he really stood for and  what he really did, like you do trump they would hate him.
@yasminv  Most women in America believe that 2nd and 3rd term abortions should be outlawed and less the mother is in danger. So trying to play that card is really dumb.
@yasminv  I don't care you can do all the women marches you want. women in America wanr  1 thing safety for our children, and the democrats don't give that to us. so we're not gonna vote for you, sorry.	 You let in pedophiles. And we don't live behind gates like them.
@washingtonpost  And the piece how could you about Mrs. Kennedy marrying for money. You are aware many democrats like Clinton do that right.
@washingtonpost  I have a great idea about the countries that everybody seems to be fleeing from because the gangs and corruption. why didn't we get something together and take out the gangs and  the corruption instead of giving them all our money.
@washingtonpost  The family separated at the border yeah I feel exactly the same way when parents do really bad things put their kids in danger in America. and they're separated from their children it breaks my heart, but it is the parents to blame not American.
@washingtonpost   they've taken my advice started putting parachutes on smaller planes. Maybe someone out there with a lot of money. can start an airline where the cargo and the people are separated when there's a problem. Losing the engine and the cargo and saving the people.
@washingtonpost  Many people want to believe that it's the Catholic Church that holds all of the marvels of the Christianity. I hate to tell these  people but it's God not a church, its  not a building not mortal men. God  you cannot take down.
@washingtonpost  I find it weird that you seem to be more excited by the number of people joining this caravan. There are unskilled probably many of them ill that's going to hurt the poorest of the population in America, and you seem to be excited for this. Who are you people
@KarenAttiah  Over and over and over and over and over again will I hear.  Mika saying trump doesn't have a right to tell the people what to think that's our job. No your to report the news. What's upsetting is there so many people in America that are now wake.
@KarenAttiah mr Hayes, you are awhere of all the murders that were also happening under Obama watch were you not? Theres no way you are this bad of a reporter. Saudis have been murdering their own people for some time.
@KarenAttiah maybe Merkel needed to open her eyes to her people and want answers. As the country has fallen over her control.
@KarenAttiah i find it odd, your friend was trying to change a country that gives no rights. When you go on msnbc and Slam Trump.	Are you either on where how corrupt they are and  the dems nevertrumper Hollywood the talk shows are?
@RichardLui  And what would you call people that show up in restaurants at their work at schools at everywhere they go and attack them, and hurt their children and their wives and their husbands a mob yes.
@RichardLui  Why don't you tell us what it is that the Democratic Party stands for oh wait  a minute higher taxes and more government oversight thank you.
@RichardLui . I think you're going to be really shocked like you were in 201 how many of every group is going to turn out to vote for republicans this time. And by the way, you're helping them by slamming trump thank you.
@RichardLui  And our slogan is when they go low we tell the truth.
@RichardLui  And the best of who we are as a country is the bill of rights in the Constitution but for some reason the democrats have seem to forgotten that.
@RichardLui  And when you say Donald Trump has destroyed the country could you possibly name with that is oh wait a minute you can't because it's a lie.
@RichardLui  If once MSNBC and the other big media companies would stop using their news as a propaganda machine people may consider even wanting to believe them.
@RichardLui  President trump is not pushing fake news he is pushing the news that the media seems to understand so little of.
@TheJuanWilliams  Women are up tight about their looks that is a sexist remark. But that's the problem with your party they are bullies.
@chrislhayes  I have a question do you ever feel silly for having a job where the only thing that you need to do every day is to destroy trump how does that make you feel.
@DavidTafuri  You tell a family of Americans that it's perfectly OK to pay taxes and have their money taken from them and given to another country. that squanders their money on stupid things because their governments are idiots. Sir your argument doesn't make sense.
@DavidTafuri  1/3 of their country lives in the United States so why are we giving Honduras money. It's not our job to improve their country's economy it is the job of their government. Is the American citizens weren't suffering it be one thing but how dare you.
@DavidTafuri  The problem with giving money to countries. the country they enriched themself and does little to help their  poor it has to come with strings. American taxpayers are sick of the user countrys. So the money that we give Honduras doesn't help anyway.
@MichelleObama  If every 1st lady from you on down do not stand out from mrs Trump  this time, with this YouTube video IT. you're all disgusting.	 And the me to MOVEMENT is baloney.
@BarackObama president Obama tell them to leave president Trump kids and wife alone. Its gone to far.
Stop.
@adrienneelrod  . And when you're in a group of democrats and you listen to them and see, who  they are you wonder why  these people are in this party. They are Snobs and crazy radicals.
@adrienneelrod  . The way the party goes after trump and his family is way past normal it is corrupt it looks like some kind of Communist cool and it scares me.
@adrienneelrod  I left the Democratic Party after Jimmy Carter. Ever since then I have been totally disillusioned with the party we stand for nothing we are corrupt and it breaks my heart.
@DanaPerino  The remark that you made on the 5 about the economy is in a free fall. do you think maybe that has something to do with November, and the fact that the dems nevertrumper Hollywood are doing this to get elected.
@SenatorCollins Thank you for standing with us.
@billmaher  I wonder if anybody ever told you that smirk on your face and  the arrogance that you come across with is not appealing.
@billmaher ones  the college was a great  places of higher learning. But as always  you people from Hollywood came and srcew with their brains. Now  you also hate  their pc craziness.	Maybe you should face the truths if you can stop being stone for a year.
@sjcloobeck Becaues great economy more jobs no isis north Korea not threatening us is what a bad thing. What is the dems plan. More taxes, leading from behind. And kissing up to countries that hate us.
@LindseyGrahamSC  Bill Maher basically put out a request to his rich buddies to crash the market, is that is what's happening here?
Bill Maher wanted  the market to crash and there you are. vote every Democrat out of office in November 6.
@chipcoffey is my mother okay. She die alone no family with her. Two hours her body suffered before she die. Dolly was her nick name. I love her.
@JimCarrey  isn't great to have the freedom to have an opinion and a voice.  no matter how ridiculous moronic or insane it is. America pretty great.
@KatyTurNBC  If you do not understand why republicans still come on your show stop and replay the show that you just did. with the young man where you were so disrespectful to him, and to the Democrat you were so respectful and you'll get your answer.
@MayorOfLA hows your homeless problem. Raising taxes as always.
@KatyTurNBC  You have your talking points down I don't mean to be disrespectful. You could have said the exact same thing to the person you were interviewing for the Democratic Party, but you didn't. Because you're a dem Propagandist not news. You guys just don't get it
@taylorswift13 one day people who didn't understand your innocent till proven guilty will find why that was so great in America. Men and little boys fear for their wives and mother. In the middle east, a man just needs to say she  did something she will be killed.
@NotSenatorHiron what is wong with you there are men and boys in my family. I was rape, and i don't want them being good men to be mistreated with out proof. Do you..
@MeetThePress  And if you wish to put up the tapes. release by dem nbc company of Trump talking locker room talk with another man. And LAPD tape of Harvey Weinstein. You may see how ridiculous you look.
@MeetThePress  By the way how is Harvey Weinstein doing these days you know the guy that your actors and actress, stood up and clapped for and said he was your God.
@MeetThePress  And one thing we did learn from the democrats from the past.  you can dress them up any way you want, and it still is a lipstick on a pig.
@MeetThePress  Hollywood might wanna understand this isn't about Hollywood you guys. You up held perverts for years and said nothing and got rich off doing it.  step back  because you're making yourself look even more ridiculous by coming out and  attacking  people with no proof.
@FrankBruni  I worked for Jimmy Carter back in the days, and I will tell you the party is Hollywood never trumpers talk shows and the media. the dems are no longer  the Democratic Party of those days. And the propaganda is getting worse and it's hurting the party.
@FrankBruni  What Lindsay did I believe was he saw a man being attacked with no proof. what he saw was the democrats attacking someone again. not because of the reasons, they're saying. but out of need to win  and I think it disgusted him and that's where you lost him.
@nbcsnl . Your propagandist for the left and you're not funny. But neither was Hitler and his goons, when he was destroying Germany. so either get funny or close your show down it's sad.
And you can attack Trump and his supporters all you want. A picture worth a thousand words. President Obama and Louis farrakhan and his army says who you all are. Dems nevertrumper Hollywood media talk shows we get it who you are.
Why didn't msnbc go after the two picks of Obama. oh thats right the gop voted for them too. Its always the dems that destroy a person  from the other side.
@TomArnold how can you not see the friendship of dems with that sick dude Louis farrakhan. Look for tapes of that jerk.
@TomArnold its the bullying we see from actors and the media they are just hateful. Talk shows its like little Hitlers. Hate of Trump is sick. And Obamas won't go away, and he's now rich off our money.
@TomArnold We didn't vote for Trump, as much as we voted againt dems Hollywood talk show the media. No one can take them anymore. Across America we like our freedoms we don't want socialism. We need to sell California back to Mexico.
@RichardEngel  Hollywood thinks that they're winning but they're not this time they showed themselves to be exactly what they are nazis.
@RichardEngel  So  3 teenagers sat and they watched your show and afterward looked at me and said what a bunch of liars. They call them  bean  heads, them who  love Hollywood Propaganda movies.	 Useful idiots.
@RichardEngel  I watched your show on Russia attacking  guns  and christians . So let me see if I've got this straight Obama saying tell Putin I can do more after I get elected that was no big. Selling 1/3 are uranium to Russia was no big deal. Obama making a joke of Mitt Romney
@SenBillNelson please don't do this. Please vote yes don't let them bully you. We are a great country don't let it die.
@LindseyGrahamDS  By the way I caught what  you said it actually brought tears to my eyes.
@LindseyGrahamDS  I am so proud that you are in our  government keep up the good work freedom and  America we need you.
@donnabrazile  You do not wait all those years to accuse somebody when he judge for 12 years. But with out proof you can destroy anyone's life. That's why America doesn't do that a Communist country do that. We're tired of prejudiced on all sides.
@donnabrazile  And after 30 hours and the constant threats that his  family had I think being upset and even in tears makes him human not someone to make fun of that's a bully.
@donnabrazile   in the Middle East a woman can be headed or stone to death their husbands and sons after worry about that all the time with no proof she can be murdered is that what you want for this country.
@SenatorHeitkamp  In the Middle East a woman can be accused with no proof and she could be stone to death or lose her I head . We never want that in this country. Proof is very important.
@Sen_JoeManchin  Thank you for voting yes we do not want to become the Middle East. Where a woman can be accused with no proof and be stone to death or behead it.
@lisamurkowski   Middle East countries men live in fear for their wives and their daughters. without any proof all they have to do is be accused by another man. And they can be buried up to their heads and stone to death or have their heads removed. Is this really what you want
@SenatorHeitkamp  Well you lost my family  vote. And I know a lot of people that watched the entire trial and realized it was nothing but as circus and it was disgusting to watch what you guys did to that family.
@ShepNewsTeam  Thank you for your honesty about how this was set up this FBI investigation good job.
@SenBlumenthal  Do something very surprising be honest and vote yes for this judge, and shock people to show them you are not just a political puppet of the left.
@SenFlakeStaff  Whatever you do stop believing crazy people that scream at you. People that have the truth do not act like this. Women thats been attack do not hate men that didn't hurt them.
@ShepNewsTeam  You just couldn't help yourself could you they did not block any FBI investigation. 87 days  three weeks longer then any time before.
@SenFlakeStaff  I stopped being a Democrat many years ago when I saw that the Democratic Party was so connected with Hollywood. Please vote yes with this judge this is gone far enough can you not see this.
@SenatorCollins  I stopped being a Democrat me years ago when I saw their connection with Hollywood is so great. please vote yes for this judge.
@lisamurkowski i stopped being a dem back with Jimmy carter. I hope the gop can see the games the dems play with the help from Hollywood. Vote yes for the judge please.
@lisamurkowski  We all understand what is at stake here you have to understand how brutal the democrats were to this man and his family. do not turn on this party vote yes vote him in do not turn on our party.
@SenatorCollins  I understand what you are saying but please understand you need to vote this man in. please don't turn against this party do not act like a Democrat. They were so brutal to this man's family and him.
@TheFive  No Greg you're wrong about the universities. every sense people like the weather underground like bill Ayres got into our colleges, and our high school's. And  junior highs an elementary they have brainwashed our children. Creepy leftton
@TheFive  Mr. Williams when you said sit back and have some fun watched the 5. are you insulting Fox again, why don't you go back to NPR because they were so fair to you and everyone else that works for them  that doesn't toe the line
@TheFive   Dana right the man testified for 30 hours and it was a constant attack in the back of the room on him this never happens on the left we never do this to you guys.
@TheFive  Mr. Williams so if he didn't say he was a choir boy and a Virgin then that would be better are you just being a bully.
@JohnKerry  Ted Kennedy and Bill Clinton you have got to be kidding you think the American public is this stupid. Nope there are just that many people on the left that are so despicable they don't care what these 2 men did.
@CoryBooker  And you're wrong  This is a trial it will either clear his name or destroy him. Don't lie to us.
@CoryBooker  Why do you think the 2 people that Obama appoint it was so easily appointed to the highest court. do you think it's because they were women or higher moral than anybody else. No, Becaues the right never lies like this left to win.
@TheFive  Because Mr. Williams anybody that's been attacked that's the problem we can't forget. So we just try to make peace with it it's the left this make a mockery out of us.
@TheFive   whats wrong about the 5 is that for some reason Mr. Williams can't rebuttal anything without reading from his notes. Attack Trump at all cost. No matter how you sound.
@TheFive  Dana  you just named off  GOP very polite and wouldn't say what trump says. You are aware there never trumpers right. And it's also the reason that to Mitt Romney and McCain did not win. because when you have to fight back and you don't you lose.
@SenatorCollins Please don't be afraid of the democrats never trumpers  and the talk shows Hollywood. Their not your friends.  My son in law from your state. So i know you got to have a heart vote yes
@SenatorCollins The more we learn about her past becomes more  questionable it becomes. Vote please yes for the judge. Don't destroy his life over this.
@SenatorCollins I am a sexual assault victim I question why anyone would wait 36 years to do this to a family. it just doesn't sound right and her testimony sounds questionable please vote for him. Don't let them pulls this gop would never do this to their pick.
@ShepNewsTeam  It's just the smirk on people's faces that hate trump everyone is just beat up and tired of it and November 6 you're all gonna find out how tired of it we are.
@ShepNewsTeam  Could you do one thing for me today could you just be honest about trump and not such a hater everyone is sick of it. Just want to know while can you pretend like you're speaking of president Obama.
Why don't that you don't find a picture of Louis farrakhan and president Obama disgusting.  you never say a word all the lies that Obama told. This is why people are starting to believe that you're not news you are the Democratic Party.
@Acosta  I am so tired of hearing you call president trump a liar. I am so tired of listening to you attack Sarah Sanders. this is not who we are, you should be ashamed to yourself I'm certainly ashame of you.
@JonSummersdc  I watch you this morning talking and you're so smug. it's unbelievable how the democrats can get that look on your face that is so smug. like we're so much better than you, it's disgusting stop it.
@JonSummersdc  By the way when you running president Trump down understand something. we're not deplorable and were not white supremacist, but that's one of the reasons you democrats will lose again, because you constantly attacking people that do not like you.
@JonSummersdc  1st of all I would like to say, that the reason that there are GOP's that agree with Obama. That's because we understand now its one party, and then there's Trump. that's why we voted for Trump. that way you guys got so upset when he won.
@jonathanchait do you understand your going to keep this hate for Trump going till you get someone hurt. Is this how you are a bully.
@TabithaK  What I have seen go on this week, makes me so disgusted with the democrats right now. how could they put this man, and his family through this, with no evidence is that who we are now?
@arielletgold  I am so disappointed when somebody says no it's just a job appointment. after destroyed his family. and him every  getting a job again what is wrong with you people. Do you not have men in your life you care about.
@OfficiaIDenzeI  I'm sorry I don't agree people in Hollywood they can have an opinion, but I don't think they were right in the propaganda of their opinion.  that is what's happening and it's hurting our children I wish you guys would stop it.
@MoElleithee  Just listening to you on Fox News yes every woman should be taken seriously. But trust me and I was sexually abused I can tell you where when and the smell in the room you do not forget this stuff and I was much younger  then her. I worry about my grandsons.
@FGossGraves     Fox Sunday im  telling you I am seeing red right now I am a victim of assault and for you  to say these things insults me greatly and I am anger by what you are saying this is so not the truth you should be a shame. I will never vote dem againt. Many won't.
@Patillo4Georgia  Do you know how absolutely insane you sounded today on TV. Let's investigate him but let's throw him out before the investigation yeah you're not totally fair. And you're one of the reasons I no longer a Democrat.
@ShepNewsTeam  I thought that was the reason we Had so many innocent men and prison. Guess they just don't matter anymore and tell there needed to be used for some other reason by the democrats. Kind like DACA.
@ShepNewsTeam  . It seems to be a reoccurring theme with the Democratic Party that only sexually assault victims seemed to be the only ones they stand behind.
@JeffFlake  Do not get bamboozled by these people that try to tell you that they have been raped like mrs Ford. they can't remember where when who and never uttered the person's name to anyone and 36 years. this is such a lie, you don't forget something like this don't let them.
@BarackObama Even though Bush lied he had a good idea there's only one president at a time please president Obama go away. Show some respect for yourself and your family and stop campaigning. If your party is so weak that they have to hold on to you and maybe your party should change.
@BarackObama When your party is more about Hollywood then about the citizens across the country you have a problem in your party.
He got intimidated hes like Obama he just wants to be loved hes afraid of losing his job.
@SenFlakeStaff  The way you come on MSNBC and CNN all the time I've always been very concerned about who you are. I think you're like Joe Scarborough. More of a Democrat pretending to be a conservative.
@SenFlakeStaff  Please do not do this by delaying you are showing that you are not on our side, that you are against us, do not do this. vote him in.
@ThePlumLineGS When a person can say you did something with no proof, can't tell you when where who. Never told anyone the name. Your men in your family are in danger and can be harm.
@NewYorker When a person can say you did something with no proof, can't tell you when where who. Never told anyone the name. Your men in your family are in danger and can be harm.
@MichaelAvenatti @realDonaldTrump @ChuckGrassley @LindseyGrahamSC Why did she go to 10 of these partys?
Jason and Trey gowdy and you being in our government along with Trump makes me feel a lot safer thank you so much for serving.
@13thDoctor2018 Were they all drinking...
@13thDoctor2018 Always when it will hurt their lives, not sooner.. come on you make us all look like liars. And yes it does take alot to speak out. Why were at a party with no parents.
@realBobWoodward these books are the last  of how we not stay Relevant. When your now a hateful hack on msnbc.
@realBobWoodward they have held on to power to long. They show their fear of all Trump he  knows about them. Its clear why all these books are written to push back. But its not Nixon its not the 70's and Trump party isn't the dems/nevertrumper party.
@Geroge_Bush  After all that Obama said about you and blamed you for it said about your wife and your family. And the things  that people that supported him said you. is not shocking  any longer because we understand you are now one party with these people.
@BarackObama  To me it is very odd how many horrible things that were said about McCain when you were running against him and about pailin and now you attacked trump.
@MeghanMcCain  When Obama was running against your father there was many horrible things that were said about your father and you said nothing to Obama.
American paid for it we have the only right to plant the flag.
@teambarbara what the job of social workers do to parents. https://t.co/CMHnUKhZLn
@antjuansea why didnt you call Obama a liar?
@benshapiro  You're right she is a coward for not wanting to debate you
@Ocasio2018 only cowards turn down debates
@morningmika Oh that's right you tell us what to think lol
@BillKristol What a racist thing to say
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump That's call fake new wouldn't say...
@FoxBusiness @KennedyNation Make Hollywood pay for it since they're the ones that have caused more of the mental and physical harm by their movies they are Communist socialist make them pay for it
@facebook  So hes thinks that by  destroying his own company is hurting  trump. wow that's how much they care about us people that buy their stupid stock.
@ABCWorldNews  Every day you people are the most toxic things on the TV.
@ABCWorldNews  You guys seriously need to stop carrying water for the Democratic Party, and become a news organization. because as people the real people that  voted for trump. We are  getting really tired of it and we plan on voting for trump again because of you.
And by the way I don't appreciate wand telling Jedediah not to yell and then you're yelling at her. you are  a chauvinist.
And talk about being cozy with Putin how about cozy with the Iranian  leaders.
@TheJuanWilliams  Can you imagine if they could dig up that trump had drugs in his past how different that would have been. or a book on my father's dream and hes a Communist.
@TheJuanWilliams  Give him some space only applies to people on the left it would seem.. And then you take it right back to what oh that's right the man had sex. You are aware that Obama did drugs right, before he became president which one is worse drugs or sex?
@TheJuanWilliams  In Benghazi everybody took the 5th the  IRS  scandal everybody took the 5th how in the world are we supposed to ever know what when on in the Obama ministration when everybody takes the 5th.
@DanaPerino  I'm also a country girl and I'll tell you something I used to be 100% behind Bush. well that was before  he lied to me, and said there's only one president at a time.  then he  came out and attack trump but he never attacked Obama, that almost  destroyed our country.
@ChrisStirewalt  I find it hysterical that people that voted for Clinton and Obama are so extremely blind that they cannot see why dems hate trump, because he knows the truth about all these people and that makes them crazy.
@ChrisStirewalt   Where is the collusion Where is the obstruction oh wait a  minute that had nothing to do with it. bringing down trump had everything to do with it right never trumpers?
@ChrisStirewalt  Did you just slam hannity because he hired this lawyer to
@FullFrontalSamB the things people are saying about Obama is Disgusting. I was standing in a supermarket the other day and I couldn't believe what these 3 people were saying about Obama I mean he was our president. And it's getting worse every day.
When you became president, I wrote you a letter and ask God to bless you and your family keep you safe I'm begging you please stop what is going on today. you  caused this hate you  need to stop this hate the riff you have left in my country is disgusting.
@RepSwalwell what is wrong with you saying that. Did you expect him to hit him! Why didn't Obama do something beside pat the guys hand and tell him he could do more.
@Comey @VanJones68 Obama Bush did the same thing. Guess you expected him to hit him. What's wrong people. China been in our business too.
@secupp we don't  get all up in the face with china why would you want Trump to start fight with Russia. Their both bad leaders under one flag. Communism. Or has that not soak in at this point. How about Iran  or noth Korean they are even more wonderful.
@cristoferosgro you really think what's happening in Germany is a good thing? When were over there last? People are not happy! So you think she got bigger balls then Trump wow.
@RepJerryNadler the American people are watching listening so the covering you try to give to Strzok. We ask why a dem does this with out shame.
@donnabrazile After what you did why are you still here

@FoxNewsSunday why would parents send kids to our country. They are paid by the drug cartels to keep us so busy we can't stop the cartels.
@FoxNewsSunday it's their country we need to withhold  aid till they change. The men that come here put them in military training send them home to fight the evil in their countries
@FoxNewsSunday  The democrats idea of immigration at the border let  every one in more votes for us.
@FoxNewsSunday  Congress do your job and then we would have this mess at the border give me a break it's not protus it's you.
@FoxNewsSunday @RepMcCaul Send them home
@FoxNewsSunday  We need to keep the families together we retain them and then send them home.
@FoxNewsSunday we need to blame parents they are the ones putting their kids in danger. Why would coyotes bring kids in? You better start checking the kids for drugs.
@SarahHuckabee so sad to see someone like George soros call the shots in our partys. But this is his handily work. One thing hate Trump. Keep and upper lip it's not you its them.
@Suzannescott @LelandVittert You will be missed I may not have away agreed but I always listen to you. Very smart man. Our lost.
The ones that cry  unjustice the loudest are usually the ones that are more unjust. that's what the dems and Hollywood are  Bullies. Smiley little bullies with a stick up their bums.
@PatrikAskPM She never act like that woman who treated baby lisa's parents like dirt. Or I guess American parents don't matter.
@earlibirdrobin I wonder why some people have to be bullies is it's something that's in sight of them or do they just get born like that.
Keep showing a picture of a child crying give me break how sad  are you people
So I wonder how nice your going to be to mrs Obama. I mean after all that was said by peter Fonda. And Roseanne ex is a liar a has been.
@maddow  When Kate Steinle died in her father's arms why did you cry? When those 2 little girls were hacked up by MS13 why didn't you cry? What is wrong with you.
@BWilliams  Hollywood what do they do their professional liars do you not get what they are. Do you not get  behind what they deal I  they're vaudeville
@TomArnold Hollywood their job lying for a living.
@MariaTCardona @SnoopDogg @CNN A gangster
@MariaTCardona Louis farrakhan hates, fight that or is he one of your.  dems stand for him.
@FaithIncNYC @AllyWhalen05 @StephenKing @pattonoswalt No this is what their parents have done because their cowards to stand up and take back their corrupt country
@FaithIncNYC @StephenKing @pattonoswalt Away to make trump to look bad
@SenBillNelson why are full grown men from other countries running to the arms of our American men to support them?
@SenBillNelson reason the kids are taken from parents maybe they are are parents. Because they broke the law and like our own citizens that do this, it's what happens. How can you be in our government and not know this?
@TheDailyShow People from socialist countrys want in to America because were capitalists. Their failed country is why we cant let them all in. Or will become the same
@madeleine America has to make it hard for people that want to live off the weath America capitalism has made. When the people fleeing from their votes in socialism have failed
@Eugene_Robinson The rich that are hurt by trump attack him, the followers of the rich are blinded by their lies. America first only mean we can not fall like other countries are. Stand with America land of the free for others are running from their countries
@donnabrazile why did you give Clinton the question? Why are you on my tv,?
@FoxNews why is donna brazile that gave question to Clinton on fox...
@iamfonda you want to keep these kids safe keep Joe Biden away from them and all of Hollywood by what we read these days.
I'm so ashamed of msnbc for using kids to control open borders
Wow why did Obama abuse children doing the same thing. Must me nice to have the media made in to a military force to control the government by one party the dems and never trumpers
Now how many news outlets are left-wingers? And how many is on the right? I think you can figure out why this sounds like propaganda on the left.
@michelleisawolf useless people usually have to humiliate them self to make any money in the world.
@FLOTUS thank you so much for putting up with so many people hurting your family. There's more of us that are sorry for what they've done. For the path that your husband is laying is that path back to freedom for all of us and away from the corruption.
@realDonaldTrump we are all behind you, may God be with you and bless you.
@mitchellreports Andrea I know it must be hard on you and your little click of good morning Joe haters of Trump. But knot it off, you sound like you hate the USA. Do you really want to be on the side if Iran?
@Thomasravenel Thomas do not let this girlfriend run your life like this. She is worse than Katherine ever was. She seriously makes you look like a fool.
@HowTRavRolls Thomas do not let this girlfriend run your life she's making you look like a fool. She flips out she goes crazy she's worse than Katherine ever was.
@RickSantorum  if you're going to be on MSNBC  may want to take  tips from Richard goodstein he really goes to bat for his side. And he like Juan Williams don't hold any punches. You on the other hand you hold back like you're in a class of kindergarten. Why GOP always loses
@thehill He had a picture with Louis Farrakhan how many times does this have to be said before people get it he was friends with Bill Ayers Reverend Wright you are The Company You Keep
@nedprice to what you just said about Trump and North Korea you do realize that a lot of people understand what's going on right? And he's not talking to his base. And he's not doing it for his base. He's doing his job
@therealroseanne how much money did they pay you to throw Trump under the bus? Didn't work America goes to the Freakshow doesn't live at the freak Show.
@Eugene_Robinson  after reading your article on a constitutional crisis. It only  say one thing the Democrats are terrified of what is coming. If half of the conservative party was seen with David Duke hugging them as we have seen with Louis Farrakhan.
No Mr King he never said he changed the laws he said he'd make our schools safe he's given as many options none of them many of the schools want to put into action. Unfortunately it's coming down to closing down the schools. Because there's something wrong with the schools
Mr. King we did the Obama Administration and the Democrats broke their word and lied to us. We voted them out. But unfortunately people like you are too big of babies to accept it.
@amjoyshow  the word racist is throwing around people have to understand. When that word has no more power is when everyone stops being racist. When they stop identifying with the race they are. And it becomes just the human race that racist will hold no more power
@FLOTUS dear first lady I know that you're doing bowling with kids. Please look into the bullying that is happening to them from teachers and their schools. I believe you're going to find that you're very surprised how badly this is.
@LeslieMarshall Hitler and his military is not the same as the Manson family. These people join these gangs  because this is what they stand for. The men that were in the military of Hitler where the military they didn't have a choice. But ms 13 are monsters
Ms 13 are monsters as was the Manson family look what they did how could you call them anything--but monsters. The left has lost their minds
Someone stop Trump from this interview it's a trap
@komonews  easy fix you do not need to do a head tax on these companies. The guns that are going to be destroyed that have been confiscated sell them back to gun dealerships.  understand why people want more business-minded people running our government. Not social workers
Debate roars on as Seattle weighs business tax for housing https://t.co/3vAf6IvKjw
@nbcsnl and I would say that they also have their King George Soros what a pair and it say it all.
So at last Hollywood has their Queen a pornstar Stormy Daniels that's on the take for any amount of money she can get.
@MichaelAvenatti rich man once said I wish I could play the game that Gore did with the green trip. sad thing is, so many people don't understand that when some people just want to get rich.  That it's not really the truth of how they're getting rich.  It's just getting rich.
I  had a manager the arrogance  unbelievable    work that this person did was not that great.  I hired a new manager was like day and night that person work so hard so a short period of time. old manager told everybody she was going to always  my best manger.  arrogance. Michelle
@AnaCabrera no one ever said anything about this doctor until now. I think that the people that voted for Trump are awake and they understand nice guys finish last. This is how you win. It's going to be different from now on.
@AnaCabrera drip drip of our dems doing things under the talbe. The media is the only one not seeing it again. So sad, all they want is to make Hollywood like them. It doesn't make them cool. Just sad.
As always his wife cold as stone, Obama  needs ever one to like him. The four of them should feel ashame of the way they treated them.
@BarackObama I don't think Louis Farrakhan has any respect for many women, or others he feels is below him.
What a look a like in a bad quality video. This woman has no Pride.
@BWilliams  Jonathan Allen little smirky smile is one of the reasons many people voted for Trump should tell your people that. We do not like little smirky nose in the air people and the one in red right now boys she's smirky with her little nose in the air.
@BWilliams you  realize we haven't forgotten about you lying . and you allow someone like Joe what's-his-name to condemn the president. And put feathers in the cap of a monster of North Korean saying he's smart. Makes you look really dumb to the American people
@Cirincione you people that go on MSNBC and you talk to someone and you continue to slam our President we just get so sick of it.
@Cirincione you're giving more credit to a monster that kills his own people than Trump, wow. you are an idiot. And I am not saying that as a joke. The United States is watching this and we understand who did this and it sure the heck wasn't the North Korea monster.
@therealroseanne okay really big bang theory is unwatchable it is a great show.
I'm sitting here watching your show and you said now I have a real woman? Will who is the mother of your children? I'm shocked  you took those kids away. I mean six months old really even people in Spain that go to prison don't get their kids taken away for that long
Our government departments has  had a very bright light shown on them. And the rats and cockroaches are scaring.  Ross Perot was still a better pic than Clinton. He wasn't a rapist and he  never destroyed a 21 year olds life, and shamed America.
@MichelleObama I read the comments that are made on your page and your husband's. And it makes me happy that so many conservatives never treat you two, the way the left is treating our president and his first lady now. You need to say something this is wrong.
@realDonaldTrump find it funny that the same people that tweet these horrible things about our president now. We're very quiet when the last president made one mistake after another an put our country in danger. But I'm still asking where was the last president during Benghazi.
@realDonaldTrump  build a military base along the wall
@JimCarrey we all have to be who we are. Guess being on the cool side is some thing most like. But in the end it just being a bully.
Freedom of speech is under attack again. If you don't say what they want, they attack the people that support you, to make you shut up. Is this not the king way all over again? Are we fearful  peasants or are we strong citizens?  freedom of speech has to be for everyone or no one
@POTUS maybe what we need is GoFundMe account for the wall and let's see if the people would do this.
@POTUS
@realDonaldTrump let's start a GoFundMe account for the wall and let's see if the people themselves will pay for the wall.
@POTUS I voted for you..thank you for winning.
@POTUS  how is it right that we give Mexico 340 million dollars  ever year. With no strings that would set up welfare and food  stamps for their poor. And how  are we making them paying for the wall?
@GovMikeHuckabee I will tell you one thing the GOP is against abortion and dems  are for abortions. They are both insane it is not your business. Be more for the children that are here and are being taken by strangers raped tortured and murdered. No one seems to talk about them?
It is really wonderful when you see President Trump show his great love for his wife. And it is amazing after all they put that family through.
@marklevinshow thank you so much I was watching your show on  TV tonight. About explaining progressiveness I have never heard it explained so clearly. It is insidious.
MSNBC commentator: If Stormy Daniels was threatened, it could 'bring down this presidency' https://t.co/pYAwYZhMAc he's a billionaire multi-billionaire do you honestly think this even makes sense in their real world?

@WeAreMCM So the Romans bridges that were made thousands of years ago are still standing but with all our technology you guys can't get it right? San Francisco bridge the earthquake
@WeAreMCM Just had to wonder who did you the favor of handing this bid over to your company.
@ShepNewsTeam and there are many teachers that are armed and they are trained on school property. So yes there are some teachers that feel we should do away with all guns. But their bodies are the only things they can throw in front of a bullet to protect their children then.
@ShepNewsTeam the Russians put out propaganda. What is propaganda? Things said that has a bias or untruthful meaning. So do you think our media that love Obama and hate Trump are guilty of this?
@RepKClark  why would a government mislead their people? Answer to control them. Why would they wish to do this? For they can lead them in to doing what they want from them. How is this free people? It's not. They are ruled.
@GeorgeCloooney I just read that Clooney and  Elites will give  money for marches against guns. They have a lot of money. What I want to see  them live without  gated community in Inglewood California for a year, without their guards and their chauffeurs that are packing heat.
I can't believe that CNN is constantly attacking Melania I just posted the recent attacks on her. I guess trying to destroy her son wasn't good enough I guess now trying to destroy their marriage is their top list sad CNN

@gdebenedetti Trump never said they did spread propaganda. He said there was no collusion or conspiracy.
@WaveAlerts seabeck wa off on off on three days of this.
@FoxNews So many DACA  got  Grants to help th  go to school wasn't that nice of us. Still not eough for them.
@ShepNewsTeam your remark about the space station being privatized. And we'll have to check with Russia come on get off of it.
@realDonaldTrump that is why we have courts for when you accuse somebody you go before a judge and you tell them your side of it. And then the  accused get to tell us their side of the story. Then proof is brought in and whoever has the best proof when's the day.
@brithume now it's nauseating is the fact that the North Koreans pushed America around for a long time. Because the people that were in control of the United States we're a bunch  of jackasses. Now we have Trump and he's not a coward.
@LeslieMarshall I thought  releasing the memo the Democrats said was going to bring down the country what gives dems?
So President Bush came out and said he knows for a fact that the last election was hacked. So the Russians must have liked Obama and Bush more than the people running against them and that's why he didn't have them hacked?
@AliVelshi how do we know we were not hacked with the Obama Administration both times? And what is it exactly are they doing to hack our vote?
@theblaze @DocThompsonShow What happen to mr Beck, he was so truthful of what was going on. Was it the attacks, or how much did they pay him.
@Pontifex The church said nothing when hitler murder. Said nothing with child rape. Now you say something?
@EllieBuzz52 @realDonaldTrump I hope Obama would for 8 years, after ever crasy thing he did. Golfing after a reporter was beheaded I was so ashame of him. Where was he in the Benghazi thing. Does anyone know?
@MontyBoa99 @realDonaldTrump And the polls were right that Clinton was winning too. Oh no they were wrong. If they were real Trump would be way up.
Trump twitter said women get out there. Some  did this to shame Trump. But it didn't work....
@NancySinatra thank you Nancy for showing exactly what this is all about sit down and shut up if you don't agree with us that's pretty much your way isn't it Hollywood.
@BarackObama on  Martin Luther King day I was watching Don Lemon. I couldn't believe how disrespectful to King's family this person was.
@realDonaldTrump it's really sad that Dianne can't be telling the truth with this. Because I know in her heart she is not a bad person. When she saw a little girl in a pinafore with no head because of Isis we saw her heart.
@CNN I'm sure there's alot of Trump supporters want to tell you where to go too.
@drsanjaygupta what part of he is in great physical shape did you not get? That is why they call you fake news now do you get it
@TheJuanWilliams in a weird way on the 5 you defend  Trump. That if a woman is in control of the situation. Why isn't she stopping it. And getting out of that situation.
@TheJuanWilliams it's too Williams would you please stop bullying Kimberly.
@kimguilfoyle when you said to Juan also president Trump has done a lot for the Border. Juan Williams as always bullied you, and you shut up. Learn something from president Trump push back a little bit.
@liamneson thank you for calling it what it is a Witch Hunt.
@TheJuanWilliams Juan you want to talk about infantile. President Obama attacked Fox News even the other day.
@TheJuanWilliams Juan how can you keep defending the left for constantly blaming Trump? When they did not blame Obama for every thing. Over Hawaii's mistake
@DineshDSouza I can't help but think why in the world they would want to make President Obama a rockstar? Why wouldn't just being president of the United States be enough. And when he called president Trump the other day Hitler I knew.
@Nicolle_Fans when the people made President Obama a rockstar. I literally lost my breath. That is scary. But now when you see the same people that voted for President Obama, hating president Trump it's not only scary. It's dangerous.
@MSNBC sometimes I wonder what the  people of the United States would have been like, without Fox News. For it seems that the other outlets of information, seems to be very bias, left. Isn't that how we got in trouble with Hitler? We do not want our presidents to be rockstars
@AliVelshi have you no shame? To make one president of Rockstar. And another president and Evil devil. Do you not love this country at all?
When we make one president of Rockstar, and another president the evil incarnate. It is not the men that should be ashamed. But the people that are doing this to them.
@JoeNBC I used to watch your show every day. And I even had it taped just in case I missed it. You need to stop this attack on a president please. Do you not see what you're doing to America. I know it's hard to be loyal. But America is worth it.
@ericbolling I hope you know the reason that they came after you and Bill. You are just too good standing up for the president. Sorry that they destroyed your life like that.
@MichelleObama mrs. Obama you must know what Melania is going through. This would tear any wife apart. Understand what must be doing to his small son. You have to stop this. Have compassion for these people.
@BarackObama President Obama please make the job of presidency for this new person easier than you have. This is so beneath anyone to have to cause so much pain to his wife and his child. Be like President Bush.
@BillClinton I don't know if I'll ever stop being angry with you. What you did to Monica Lewinsky was so bad. You destroyed that poor woman's life for so long. But to make up for it you could possibly try to make Trump's presidency a little easier on his wife and his child.
@FLOTUS I know it must be hard for you to constantly have your husband under attack. I just wanted to say thank you for putting up with so many bad mannered people in this country.
@Pontifex I love God above all things on this Earth. But you Pope you need to understand America is not under the rule of the church. So please step back and understand your place. We are America not England.
@MittRomney you never want your president to look like a rockstar. I truly believe that is what they made Obama look like. But Trump he looks like what he is a servant of the people. That's why you lost met you acted like you were above the people.
@greggutfeld I think with the media has a problem with his Obama was a rockstar like Hitler. And Trump does not care what they think of him. So he says what he wants.
@tedlieu someone that works for the government should never be looked at like a rockstar. You understand  his place and that is in the Servants of the people. I do not think Trump thinks he's a rockstar.
@HallieJackson you can always tell a bad president when he acts like a rockstar and not an employee. Well we know that's Trump is not a rockstar.
@chrislhayes when we turn our president into a popstar we could be making a Hitler. Well we can surely say Trump is not Hitler. He does not have theedoa an people worshipping him.
@NicolleDWallace why does some wish to make the job of the president, as a popularity contest. Sometimes a good parent is not always loved. But that was the right thing.
@KatyTurNBC maybe trump has turn the president job, away from a rock star job, and in to the service of the people. He hasn't made any money from us.
I understand the importance of having a healthy community. For an outbreak could really devastate our population. But mental illness it is hurting as all. And we need to address this.
We need families be able  to see good psychiatrist and psychologist. The doctors could donate their time 1 or 2 times a month. And get tax write-offs for their charitable contribution to the wellness to these families. Taking away our guns is not the answer.
