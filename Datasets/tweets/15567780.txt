@elicoh @nicholadrummond What @elicoh said. Industry is excited about NGCV portfolio and that was reflected. Army is scaling back funding for Bradley upgrades so why showcase that? And who knows what other legacy fleet systems could be affected by a $25 billion shift across FY20 FYDP for modernization.
@SpencerGuard @JohnD2231 We’ll find out more about what’s getting cut or terminated in the FY20 budget and POM. There’s been a massive undertaking to reallocate $25 billion from equipping peg into modernization efforts. We just don’t know the details yet.
The last time my feet felt like this I had just finished the Marine Corps marathon and had to walk across the Key Bridge into Georgetown then up Wilson to find a cab to take me home. Except this time I just kind of walked around a little bit today. #tradeshowtrimester #AUSA2018
@JohnD2231 @SpencerGuard I don’t think there’s any indication they are going with one replacement. They will buy what works when it works.

@johnmdonnelly I totally agree! That's just how appropriations work. Haha!
@johnmdonnelly Now it will be interesting to see how the MDR treats this stuff. Seems the Pentagon is somewhat warmer to the idea of space-based sensor development than taking it a step further to the intercept-from-space development.
@johnmdonnelly But the MDR could push for this anyway. My point was that this isn't the first time Congress has mandated work begin on this type of capability. It was a bit soft saying it should comply with the MDR, but still not the first time.

@CameronJJJ I've heard a number of things as to why there has been a major delay... nothing verified on the record, but I'm hearing that things should be moving now. Time will tell.
@CameronJJJ Yes, yet another NDAA with no Missile Defense review to guide it. I hear its forthcoming, but I'm scared to hold my breath! It will probably come out while I'm on vacation!
The #NDAA19 would require the Missile Defense Agency to submit an unfunded requirements list to Congress annually. MDA submitted one this year, but I don't believe that's been the norm. Maybe I'm wrong. Also, is that required for all the other services or just requested? Anyone?
The #NDAA19 requires the Missile Defense Agency to provide unclassified information related to the schedule for planned missile defense tests.
Congress continues to push for a homeland defense radar in Hawaii that it wants to be operational by fiscal year 2023, according to #NDAA19
Congress, in its #NDAA19, wants the Missile Defense Agency to establish a boost phase intercept program and initiate a missile defense tracking and discrimination space sensor layer as well as develop a high powered directed energy laser for MD applications.
#NDAA19 authorizes $140 million for MDA to develop space sensing projects and accelerate hypersonic defense capabilities.
#NDAA19 summary continues to inject funding support to tie Patriot and THAAD missile defense systems together, part of a joint urgent operational need in the Korean peninsula area of operation.
The #NDAA19 should also promote rapid development and fielding of an initial maneuver SHORAD system. Army's already moving full steam ahead there.
Congress is authorizing six additional AH-64E new build helicopters for the National Guard to address shortfalls (ARI took Apaches from the Guard and transferred to active force, shrinking Guard numbers). #NDAA19
#NDAA conference bill summaries are out. Congress wants to ensure the Army modernizes its Brigade Combat Teams and gets the most advanced versions of Stryker and Paladin Howitzers.

@EricaMartinson I waited until I got to my car to cry but I was close to possibly punching a wall in the Zoning department waiting room.
@Rakora10 @ValerieInsinna My car is black! But the interior is probably not very sanitary...
@Rakora10 @ValerieInsinna You’ll never know unless you try!
In this case does it really matter whether it came from the mayor? It’s a good thing to do no matter who makes the request. https://t.co/V5MA04KxK4
@AaronMehta Wow, just wow.
Just got to Wolcott, CT, and what do I see but a giant black bear lumbering across someone’s yard. I’m from Colorado and have less of a chance seeing a bear in my yard there.
@ValerieInsinna @Rakora10 I’m on vacation today through Thursday! But hey, I’m sure we will have more horribly hot days this summer!
@ValerieInsinna Just tell him it takes a month to get approved for a mortgage or something. The house will be sold by the end of the weekend anyway, I guarantee it, so your worries will be over shortly.
@Rakora10 I wish I was there to have one!!!
A coworker baked cookies in her car today. That is maybe the only good thing to come out of living in an actual oven. #goawayheatwave
@OkieStones @natehale Nope VA! I could just buy a gun in the next 30 minutes. Super efficient over here unlike getting a fence.
US spy planes are breaking down ― and lawmakers want answers https://t.co/eBGk5eIRF2
@DefenceViper Obviously I’d be totally fine! Even if I attached remote weapon stations to the top of it, as long as it’s not six feet or higher...
@PGrasmehr If trespassing was my number one reason for a privacy fence I’d be all for this plan. And it’s nice to know that it’s easier to lay a mine field on my property than just get a fence not much taller than the average person.
Also fun fact! You can’t have a privacy fence or gate that is six feet high within 25 feet of the front of your property line even though the front of your house can be well over six feet high and closer to the front of the property line. Makes sense.
I’ll add I’m now drenched in sweat and my own tears and have made a new friend at Kinkos trying to get a plat survey to the exact size demanded by the zoning department. Too bad the paper it was printed on was not the original size, whatever that size was.
@natehale Then maybe the social security office?
Today I had a great high level conversation about national security and defense with smart people at a downtown think tank. Then I went to the Zoning Department for a fence permit and it was like the IQ of the total room dropped down to below 65. So I’ve had a “varying” day.

@AzorInfo The airlines are partly to blame as I feel like I have no room regardless. But people who literally can't fit without spilling into half of a second seat should be paying more or I should pay half of my ticket since I got half of my seat.
@Jerry_Drelling They tried!  But everything is taken except a middle seat and I pee like every 30 minutes because I'm pregnant and I'm not about to make some poor person have a miserable flight because of me getting up over and over. Shitty situation!
@AzorInfo Big can be beautiful. But right now I am physically uncomfortable because I barely have a place to sit on this plane. That isn't okay.
I know I sound terrible but this is reality.
Also if you need a belt extender on a plane, you need to buy the seat next to you too because you are extending yourself into someone else’s seat as well. It’s only fair.
I get to spend the next seven hours with half a seat while also carrying an extra human being inside of me.
I may be having the worst international flight experience ever. I upgraded my aisle seat because it was advertised as a duo seat. That did not mean I got both seats apparently. Normally this mistake wouldn’t have been awful except the fattest person on this plane is next to me.

The saddest part of my day is "treating myself" to a decaf latte from Starbucks at an airport after midnight and trying to convince myself I'm as happy as that lady in the Folger's commercial seems taking a big whiff of her coffee in the morning with a smile.

@armymapguy I'd take that if it meant I'd get 8 hours of sleep in my own bed tonight...
@ValerieInsinna @frankrebecca But that is moot if you know the other person in the other middle seat and can favor in that direction. She leaned towards me, once again evidence she wanted to escape her marital prison.
@ValerieInsinna @frankrebecca I felt sorry for the wife, almost, but then she stole the arm rest the whole flight, so that sympathy went away.
@elicoh But I'm so glad it takes less than 80 days to actually get around the world now.
@frankrebecca @ValerieInsinna I've literally never encountered someone that was just learning the airplane seat belt thing before, but now I can say I've met that someone and it was a bit of a shock.
@ValerieInsinna There was a point where the husband fell asleep and the wife had to go to the bathroom, but really it looked more like an escape attempt. She couldn't figure out her seat belt and was desperately tugging, so I helped by demonstrating with my own like a trained flight attendant.
Idea for airports! Create legit business lounges (I've seen half-assed attempts) where people can work in quiet with outlets and good lighting. I'd pay good money for this.  I am in Dubai. Dubai has a pool. I do not need a pool right now.
I did not get the open farter, but I did get a lady who let her husband buckle her seat belt and chose her in flight entertainment for her, which was watching the flight progress on a map. I'm pretty sure she watched Phantom Thread with me as a silent movie.
@reporterjoe @AaronMehta Omg don't make me choose!
@millerth3 No I think that's burping.
She did the classic lean forward off your seat and let it rip.
Taking bets on whether I get the lady that just openly passed gas next to me at the gate in the seat next to me on the plane.

Okay I take it all back. I got the same dude to put mud on me since I'm by myself and I got like a spa treatment. He even cracked my toes, you guys. I tipped him big.
Well that's weird. I just watched a beach staffer at my Dead Sea hotel put mud all over a girl in front of her boyfriend or husband as he just sat there and watched.

HASC chairman's mark also adds $140 million to Missile Defense Agency to develop directed energy and space spending projects and the accelerations of hypersonic defense capabilities.

And it looks like it has prompted change as the HASC chairman's mark includes increased funding for flying hours by $24.2 million. Allowing more time in the air "will help reverse the tragic trend of military aviation accidents," the summary states.
The HASC chairman's mark summar also notes the Army will get to conduct 20 Combat Training Center rotations in FY19, including 4 Army National Guard rotations, doubling the number of CTC Brigade Combat Team rotations.
And our @MilitaryTimes investigation of aviation mishaps got a shoutout in the chairman's mark summary regarding its findings that mishaps rose nearly 40 percent from FY13-17. Here is our full report: https://t.co/Um4ttSmk5J

BG Francis said the Combat Readiness Center has an initiative that is focused on near misses during training, that teaches lessons to pilots and is going around to CABs with the info which is turning out to be very powerful #18SUMMIT
Army is doing a number of things to keep those rates down - one is a big focus on training and where threat drives aircraft lower to ground, pilots have to get back basics and train for emergency procedures and train that hard in a simulator, BG Francis says  #18SUMMIT

@aarondleong @ValerieInsinna I seem to recall hearing last night during the briefing that air defense was employed from Syria but was not successful, but I can't remember for sure.
Sarin and chlorine were manufactured at the Barzah site, according to Pentagon #SyriaStrikes
The U.S. is not aware of any civilian casualties "so far" - the U.S. deployed over 100 weapons against the targets.
The US has not seen any military response from actors within Syria so far. #SyriaStrikes
No UK, US or French aircraft was successfully hit by enemy air defense #SyriaStrikes
Named targets are the Barzah Research and Development Center and the Him Shinshar Chemical Weapons Storage and bunker. They were hit about 4:00 a.m. #SyriaStrikes
The operations last night in Syria took out three distinct chemical weapons targets. #SyriaStrikes
Pentagon SPOX Dana White said "we successfully hit every target" in #SyriaStrikes last night.

Trump Orders Strikes on Syria Over Suspected Chemical Weapons Attack via @nytimes #syriastrikes https://t.co/dXwfEuxNMl
@barbarastarrcnn reporting that later tonight in 50 minutes the press expects a briefing at the Pentagon and expects a military update on what has occurred.
Trump notes America does not seek an indefinite presence in Syria "under no circumstances."
Trump said he had a message to countries responsible for backing Assad regime - Iran and Russia - asking what nation wants to be associated with the mass murder of innocent men, women and children.
Trump said the U.S. is prepared to sustain this response of air strikes until Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents.
Trump calls Assad's attacks using chemical weapons on his own people "crimes of a monster"
Trump has ordered precision strikes on targets in Syria through combined operations w/ France and U.K. now underway.

@wardcarroll Strangely, Greaves never used the little globe during testimony. We will never know what the plan was for that.
@tony__R1 @MIL_STD He really didn’t seem that into the idea of Tamir for Patriot but that is my personal opinion.
At the same time, Greaves said the threat of hypersonic technology ending up in the hands North Korea and Iran is extremely high and spaced based sensor capability is needed to address that threat.
Greaves said the 19 budget request allows “us to continue the discussion for the need for space based sensors” that will get to a quick decision to request funding needed.
@tony__R1 @MIL_STD Maybe I zoned out but Greaves said nothing about IBCS and IFPC today.
@elicoh @MIL_STD Yes this has been widely reported.
Israeli company Rafael’s Tamir missile should be considered for Patriot integration but Greaves cautioned the Patriot missile and THAAD take care of lower tier defensive capabilities.
Greaves said East Coast missile defense site would provide additional capacity and capability should Iran threat grow, but he’d prefer prioritizing improving the sensor layer of current system.
Greaves said, despite SM3 Block IIA failure in test this year, system is sound. component that failed has worked well in 9 out of 10 tests.

@henrycobb That accounts for fixed wing and drones. The story is only addressing rotary wing.
I have to add the accident that resulted in the death of two Apache pilots over the weekend shows there's still plenty to do to make Army aviation safer. I wrote this story before the accident.

These lovely specimens were near the warhead test sight. It’s Blue Bonnet season here in Texas! https://t.co/6zud2rO6bZ
@ArmyASAALT In my opinion, either works. https://t.co/ms1w7H0E1D
The @OrbitalATK test today was on a new warhead developed for hypersonic application in 60 days with three components out of five made with additive manufacturing.
From a very qualitative initial view, one engineer on the warhead program said based on where the fragmentation hit the metal sheets it appears to line up with previous modeling. @OrbitalATK gathered all data from test successfully.
Aftermath of the test is legit. Metal sheets mangled and covered in shrapnel holes. There was an arena and the arena is no more. Again, no visuals yet. They have to be cleared for release but what I just was was pretty impressive.
View from the test arena. Sorry I’m not authorized to photograph the test site but there’s a gorgeous view from here. https://t.co/v8qVjc8toO
@OrbitalATK is hanging its warhead in the test arena now and we are safely in a bunker, as long as no scorpion, snake or spider crept in here.
@ArmyASAALT @OrbitalATK That’s what I heard out my window last night! Thought it was a skunk ape.
RT @ArmyASAALT: @JenJudson @OrbitalATK Watch out for the #Chupacabras too. I heard they're bad again this year...
So far the safety briefing at this @OrbitalATK warhead test I’m at in Texas has consisted of the typical instruction on what to do if there’s a fire but also to watch out for rattle snakes, scorpions and black widows.

@SharkParsons @unoperiodico @FORSCOM But you may want to use some of the cool tech that came out of FCS. Why not?
@SharkParsons @unoperiodico @FORSCOM Yeah but I think Abrams' point here is that NGCV isn't going to try to be EVERYTHING like FCS tried to be. This capability's focus is more narrow.
@unoperiodico @FORSCOM I mean repeating FCS would be bad, but Abrams, in far more characters than Twitter allows, explained that NGCV is a focused effort on manned unmanned teaming to deliver capability like mobility and lethality in a dense urban environment.
Gen. Abrams @FORSCOM cmdr just said each of the Army Futures Command cross-functional team leaders will become stand-alone jobs this summer when the command stands up as opposed to now where the Brig. generals have day jobs. Only CFT that won't is soldier lethality. #AUSAGlobal

@FJBoccadoro Meh, I wasn't thinking wrong. I was just reading the news, which has since evolved as you may be aware.
Trump makes it sound like the president gets the #omnibus at the exact same time everyone else gets it... apparently it takes a while to read... And he just said "nobody read it" and "it's only hours old." What was I doing all Wednesday night then?
(And after the reality-TV level scripted about-face this morning) Trump is expected to sign spending bill despite earlier veto threat https://t.co/VMETxzW5Ws
Another good #omnibus tidbit is Congress wants to provide an additional $110M in OCO RDT&amp;E funding for a limited interim missile warning system to detect enemy man-portable air-defense systems. Army had only requested $30M in aircraft survivability development otherwise.
Spoke too soon, there's even more funding for this effort in the FY18 #omnibus for sensors, tests and targets -- an additional $35.7 million.
FY18 #omnibus also funds the new homeland ballistic missile radar in Hawaii - a total of $61 million in RDT&amp;E funding. FY19 request calls for funding for a 2nd missile radar system at another TBD location in the Pacific.
Wrote this 4 days ago that the Army was going to get THAAD and Patriot systems to communicate within two years. Looks like there's $182.7 million increase in funding in the FY18 #Omnibus for it that responds to a JEONS. https://t.co/cs8kJL9pho
I was thinking, does that $1.1 billion increase in the FY18 #omnibus for Army aviation make up for the budget cut in aviation in the FY19 request at least in part?
Trump threatens to veto omnibus bill because it does not address DACA recipients, fully fund border wall. I thought some kind of agreement had been worked out a few days, but I guess not. agohttp://wapo.st/2pzg4fV?tid=ss_tw&amp;utm_term=.892ee1052766

Congress races to pass $1.3T defense-friendly omnibus and avoid shutdown via @reporterjoe https://t.co/6LliGduEh1
For land vehicles in FY18 #omnibus there is $348M for 116 Stryker DVH upgrades; $300M for Stryker lethality upgrades; $1.1B for 85 Abrams tank upgrades; $483M for 145 Bradley upgrades, and $220M for Guard Humvee recap, including $120M specifically for ambulance modernization.
In the #omnibus that just dropped, Congress is appropriating $16.2 billion, $1.9 billion above the budget request, for the procurement of missiles	and ammunition. The services have said they need to replenish due to expenditures over past several years.
In Army aviation, #omnibus funds 17 more AH-64s, 8 CH-47s, 11 UH-72s for the active, 8 UH-60s for the Guard, as well as more Shadow UAS and 9 more Grey Eagle UAS. Totals $1.3 billion in additional aviation assets across the force.
The #omnibus 2018 also brings total FY18 appropriations for the Missile Defense Agency to $11.5 billion, an increase of $3.3 billion above the FY2017 enacted level, that includes the roughly $2 billion already approved in December.
The #omnibus agreement for FY18 fully funds an Army active duty end strength of 1,322,500 and a reserve component end strength of 816,900, an increase of 9,500.
@Tia_Barracini The Army would have until the end of FY19 to spend its FY18 funds in RDT&amp;E. Without they would have to obligate the majority by the end of the fiscal year and that would suck.
The Army will have only until end of FY19 to obligate research, development, test and evaluation money, however, according to the FY18 approps bill that just dropped tonight.
From first glance at the FY18 budget bill text looks like the Army will be give until Sept. 30, 2020 to spend roughly $24 billion in procurement dollars.

@syedmohdmurtaza So they are not slow by a decade.. they weren’t interested in working on it at all. That’s a big difference.
@syedmohdmurtaza Still not sure how you are getting that they are slow from my report... Army wasn't working on SHORAD until 1.5 years ago because they didn't need it in the Middle East. Now it is has already fielded a temporary solution with an interim coming in just a few short years.
And the Army has changed the name of its ATACMS replacement program from LRPF to Precision Strike Missile or PrSM. Prototypes from @Raytheon and @LockheedMartin will be demonstrated in 2019.
Also among the efforts includes extending the range of cannon artillery in the near-term. Demonstrations on that capability are happening now at Yuma.
Army to demonstrate precision strike, hypersonics and ramjet capabilities in just a few years https://t.co/7xk0kAmNGh

@Timpressive This is true, it's my understanding he'd drink a lot of watered-down whiskey at lunch. That must have really helped with the two hour nap.
Thinking about this even further, working late into the wee hours like Churchill did is actually great for productivity because there is nobody awake to disrupt your flow...
I'll add though that Churchill's schedule was actually pretty horrible. He'd wake up, work from bed for a while, eat lunch, play cards, take a nap, wake up at 6:30 pm then eat a big dinner, then work from 11 pm onward into the wee hours.
In the Darkest Hour there's a scene where Winston Churchill refuses to schedule a regular meeting with the king each week because it conflicted with his nap. I think there is a lesson to be learned here and it's that naps are key to greatness.

And I'm actually learning that a Rafael spokesperson might have misspoken when he told DN that Iron Dome was being offered up to replace the IFPC multi-mission launcher in development by the US Army. I don't know how you possiblY misspeak about that but will see. More to come.
I'm going to note there's still not a lot of clarity to the statements made during the HAC-D hearing about Iron Dome. Milley said IFPC is supposed to be mobile. I actually don't think that's a requirement. Also Iron Dome is mobile, at least that's what Rafael says.

Hyten said AMD development and advancement doesn’t go fast enough. One way to go faster is to get a budget. He said a budget is needed by the first of the year otherwise “we will be screwed.”
Hyten said the one problem he has with the nuclear posture review is that the missile defense review is a separate document. #AUSA AMD forum
Hyten said Russia got its nuclear arsenal 100 percent modernized by 2000. The US is close to zero percent modernized. But he notes we have plans in place to modernize. #AUSA AMD forum
Hyten also says “war in space” isn’t a thing. It’s just war. #AUSA AMD forum
Strategic Command commander Gen. Hyten says he chafes every time he reads that the command is considered a functional combatant command because he considers it a global warfighting command. #AUSA AMD hot topic happening now.

Army is looking at Long Range Precision Fires future capability development but much is still predecisional. On the table could be supporting the Paladin PIM program with range and rate-of-fire improvements among other upgrades, @UnderSecArmy told the @USACGSC
@UnderSecArmy said size of force needs to grow but should be balanced to ensure growth doesn’t cause quality issues or funding problems. He said getting into the mid-500,000s gets difficult to maintain quality and cost.
@UnderSecArmy just got a question at @USACGSC about the NIE being canceled and the rationale behind it. Here’s my story on that: Army kills off Network Integration Evaluations in FY19 budget request https://t.co/ITOMEmApsL
From @USACGSC we’ve got questions about the budget, acquisition pace, technology development, the new cross functional teams and possible increased presence in Europe.
@UnderSecArmy said requirements process can be 7 years and acquisition programs up to 20. He asks “if you have a guy that can throw a 90 mph fastball why would you wait until he’s 40 to put him in the majors” to stress the need to speed up acquisition process.

The Army plans to incrementally improve the Paladin (PIM) to 10x capability. The chassis has been a significant improvement but it is looking at a project to take the gun and increase its ranges, @VCSA_PAO said at SASC
Within each Army modernization priority, @VCSA_PAO said the @USArmy sees one or two systems that it  will be laser focused on.
@VCSA_PAO said at SASC, @USArmy working on hypersonics to extending tube artillery as part of Long Range Precision Fires priority and will likely focus on three systems and have industry invest along with w/ Army to bring them online.

Vice Chief of Naval Operations made a good point: spending a year's worth of money in 5 months would be challenging without flexibility to move money and reprogram easily.
Without the budget caps things looked grim for the Army and would have left them with a choice: maintain or modernize, but not both https://t.co/TIXjtfiRvr
