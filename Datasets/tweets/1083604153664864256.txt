Loyola Law School recently helped release a man serving 25 years to life for a murder he did not commit b/c of California's Felony Murder Rule. Thank you @LoyolaLawSchool #thisispreisonreform @NancySkinnerCA
California: charges tons of taxes on legal marijuana	CA Residents: keep buying from non-taxed sources	California: https://t.co/QU2cPSwa3e
In November 2018, the Prevention of Cruelty to Farm Animals Act was passed in California. The Act places parameters on marketplace animal confinement, and also prohibits sale of their meat and products if kept in spaces too small. @peta @FarmForward
In CA, in 2017, Bill 485 was signed by @JerryBrownGov to ban the sale of non-rescue animals. In 2018 the bills was set to begin and helped stop the support of mass breeding factories. CA's initiative to improve animal protection is inspiring! #Bill485 @HumaneSociety #CA #TX
New California bill will change the advertisements of kids meal drinks, a step in the right direction. However, we need to promote healthy drinks (and food) choices among all ages!! @WeArePHA
@GavinNewsom is proposing a record $80.7 billion in K-12 education, albeit just a proposal, still a great step in the right direction. #publiceducation https://t.co/TxYBcSz77p
@GavinNewsom supports goal of producing 100% energy from renewable sources by 2045, wants to be a net exporter of clean power by shipping surplus to our neighbors. Companies would be charged for their greenhouse gas production and 35% revenue would go to low income communities.
Education, transparency and security are crucial for California's elections so that democracy retains its legitimacy and continues to function as a reflection of the will of California's constituency. #electionhacking #CAOPSEC #NEDC #votingvillage
An immigration haiku: 		Immigrants are great.	Education is a right.	Lets help DREAMers fight!		#highered #immigration #DREAMERS #DACA
Why is nationwide gun violence increasing? What are some plans of action we can take to reduce such cases? #gunsafety #schoolshootings #humanrights
Why hasn't California done more to oppose the current administration's immigration policies? What is the role of the state in protecting its residents? @ACLU @XavierBecerra @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems
Levels of teacher pay in public schools should be reexamined-there have been strikes throughout the nation to protest unfair teacher pay. This problem is critical to ensure our kid's future success. #teacherpay @usedgov
Homelessness is an ongoing problem in CA, lawmakers are constantly working on the issue and many advocacy groups work on this issue-yet, the issue has not been alleviated or solved. @HUDgov @SHRAhousing @Mayor_Steinberg
They fight for our rights only to get theirs taken away. The Supreme Court rules in favor of the Trump Administration's transgender military ban. #theRealT
I don't want my state to look like the next #Fallout game. Thank you Gavin Newsom for your pledge to fight wildfires. #calfire #calwildfires https://t.co/cH7AUSvqhs
The recent damage done to National Parks has made it obvious we need to be doing more. These parks are part of our national identity and their protection should not be taken lightly. @EPA @NatlParkService @Interior @NPCA
YES for funding out schools! Do you want CA students to be in schools that don't enhance their education? As a student at CSUS I value the power of education. Modernized schools prepare students for the future. #HigherEducation
How can we better support our patients health without overprescribing opioids? Who should we blame for the opioid epidemic? @CAPharmBoard @MedBoardOfCA @cvspharmacy @shcssacstate
Hearing parents are told to send their deaf children to a mainstream class to give them the best chance at normality. How can this be the best option if they aren't able to communicate and understand properly what they are being taught? @GallaudetU @Lifeprint_ASLU @RuthSwanwick
Magic mushrooms meet massive medical maturation. New research points towards societal benefits through the use of psilobin in clinical therapy. @DenverElections
Why has the US taken away the ability for transgender people to service in the military? All should be able to be the sword and shield of America. As a country shouldn't we let those who can serve do so with pride? #swordandshield @LGBTMilPartners
Research shows that children gain creativity, curiosity, and memory skills from musical instruction and bilingual education, so why aren't we implementing these programs in our schools? @CADeptEd @educationweek @usedgov
Water the ways that climate change may affect Sacramento County @SacCountyCA? Trick question! We are already experiencing less rainfall and more intense heat waves. This means we may have less access to local water. #climatechange #publicaction
In the US, millions of households suffer from food insecurity, yet we have billions in food waste. We should work with the EPA and USDA to reduce the amount of food waste and reduce food insecurity by 2030. @EPA @USDA
Not everyone in the US can afford healthcare, and that is a very serious problem. Especially when their family are already struggling with rent and food. #healthcare #medical https://t.co/WK3xflbS48
With 200,000 cases per year, the opioid epidemic is an important issue that can quickly change from a helpful prescription to a deadly addiction. #opioidaddiction #opioidawarenessfoundation #nationalinstituteondrugabuse
4 years spent earning a degree to work in a dream career, only to find employment and housing challenging. College did not prepare me for this! #sonotreadyforpostcollegelife @deptoflabour @usedgov @HUDgov
What is behind the last two decades increase in gun deaths, crime, and mass shootings? Guns? Too many policies? Not enough? #guncontrol #gunreform #MarchForOurLives #NRA
DREAMERS need a voice too. DACA recipients are unable to vote for themselves, leaving their future in others hands. Isn't it time they had a voice of their own? #coalitionforhumanimmigration #unitedwedream
Gun control, better with or without it? Pro-gun advocates argue that gun control is unconstitutional while gun control advocates say it is not. Is there any acceptable level of control over the 2nd amendment? #AMA
Think about some of your favorite foods or even places to eat. Are you happy about the food quality given? Maintaining better quality food products will help our nation and future generations from poor health and our biggest struggle of all: obesity. #FDA #USDA #food #plantbased
It's 2019 and gay marriage is legal, but so is forcibly sending minors to conversion therapy in 35 states. How is this possible? Is stopping the torture of children not a bipartisan issue? #trevorproject #gayconversiontherapy
How much money have states paid out to settle law suits against police officers and departments to victims of police brutality? @ACLU @ESOP_STL https://t.co/wwWLmZLILb
Animal testing is an important issue that is not thought about or discussed enough. American politics need to bring more attention to and create laws to ban animal testing. #nottotestwouldbebest @ASPCA @CrueltyFreeIntl #DanielleMonet
E-cigarettes have been credited with creating a new wave of nicotine addicts among American youth. Why is Juul being targeted over other brands? #bigtabacco #ALA
Women and children are more likely to be homeless than any other group. #womenandchildrenfirst #facinghomelessness @TheCoalitionSF @GavinNewsom
#Sexed is one of the most impactful and least discussed issues facing today's youth. @Potus and his administration are seeking to defund inclusive comprehensive programs in favor of an abstinence-only approach. #sexed
Rising healthcare costs is an epidemic nationwide. Many people avoid proper care due to the intimidating hospital bills; this puts our families and loved ones at risk. Although healthcare costs impact citizens across the country, is CA impacted more? #CDPH #GaryReedy
Is keeping the penny actually worth it? @usmint @USTreasury https://t.co/VVvXGkYZLC
Do you want to live in a world on fire? Me neither! Earth's climate is currently being altered faster than at any other point in the history of modern civilization and human activity is the primary cause. The time to act is now! @EPA #GlobalWarming #climatechange
If pain free is the way to be, then access to physical therapy is necessary. #endopioidaddiction #choosePT
More should be done for our United States veterans as they adapt back to social life especially after experiencing traumatic events in combat. Bad healthcare and housing options. SAD!
The Bay Area's affordable housing crisis is being resolved by a public-private housing partnership including @facebook?? #makeitmakesense https://t.co/yxD9KnSmDN
CA has a top 10 world economy yet lacks in areas concerning veterans. Requirements in CA for benefits that haves have earned are more stringent than those in other more vet friendly states. Stand for those who stood for us! @DeptVetAffairs @DorisMatsui #vets
An increase in teen pregnancy can possibly be caused by the lack of contraceptive availability. @PPFA #FDA #PlanB #Centerforreproductiverights
The Trump Administration approved policy allowing the lease of land in arctic wildlife reserves for oil drilling projects. Drilling threatens important species, habitats, and resources, and exacerbates global climate change. #departmentoflandmanagement #BrianSteed #DavidBernhardt
Cali you stay lit!	Every year wildfires devastate CA	You deserve elected officials who understand this as a threat!		Follow @treespond an organization dedicated to planting trees destroyed by wildfires. #California #smokeybear #wildfires
People are the lifeblood of a functioning #democracy, CA Assembly Bill 177 by @Evan_Low and @LorenaSGonzalez takes steps to make sure EVERY voice is heard. Plus it's another holiday and this time the present is freedom!
The Wiin Act: Not a Win Win. Is the removal of plants in the CA Delta being done in the best way? Poisonous chemicals linked to cancer are put in the water we use for farming throughout CA. What are the effects on water and the human body? #CADelta #CAfarming #fishandwildlife
The housing crisis has been a major issue over the past decade. Cost has substantially increased leaving more Californian's unable to afford houses, leading to an increase in homelessness. Can Gavin Newsom's ideas on housing address this issue? @CALmatters
As the 21st century progresses, society is slowly realizing its reliance on nonrenewable energy is a source of peril for the planet. Previous attitudes and preferences have lead to indifference to the environment #EPA #environment #renewableenergy #solar
We need to find solutions to keep children out of the juvenile justice system. Children &amp; young adults need after school programs, improving the quality of life and behavior. We need these programs to help children express who they are! #START #assessatriskyouth #deterdelinquency
CA legalized marijuana in 2018, but more work is to be done combatting misconceptions from the past. The marijuana sector is growing fast and looking to last! #bureauofcannibiscontrol #CBCC
Climate change has devastating consequences, increasing global temperatures, rising sea levels, creating extreme weather and droughts, and wildfires. #pollution #climatechange
Healthy Californians make a happy state! #healthcareforall @CoveredCA #healthcare
There is a growing drug problem in rural communities in CA. One of the main drugs that has increased in use is meth. I propose we add more drug counseling and rehab centers in small rural towns, this would help them beat their addictions. #rehab #drugcrisis #drugcounseling
California along with 40+ states have a felony murder rule that can sentence individuals to LWOP for a murder they did not commit, thoughts? #fixthesystem #LWOP @ACLU @SentencingProj
1.3 million low-income adult, undocumented workers in CA do not receive equal access to Medi-Cal. Don't let citizenship status effect health outcomes! Contact your state representatives and vote for change. #accesstohealthcare #healthcareforimmigrants
CA's ban on plastic bags is one step every state can take for the protection of our beaches. Texas could be the next state! Who wouldn't like a cleaner South Padre Island #SPI #litter @GregAbbott_TX #plasticban
The Resource Specialist Program (RSP) is a program offered in K-12 schools to help support children with learning disabilities. The fed Sect of Ed, Betsy Devos, proposals to reduce funding may lead to a shortage of education programs such as RSP. #RSP #publicschools
Gas tax in California is here to stay, it makes gas more expensive-will it help fix the roads? #Prop6 #Californiafueltax #CAroadfix #transportationproject
CA is 1 of only 6 states in the US offering #familyleave to its employees. Being the #5thlargest economy in the world CA has the influence to lead the US into creating a national parental leave policy. Extending policy from #12weeks to #6months in CA is necessary for new families
The health of our nation is in crisis. California recently passed a bill that will require restaurants to advertise healthier drinks without artificial sweeteners for kid meals. How do you think this will affect the younger generation? @WeArePHA
Education is important! Some students don't get the resources they need to succeed in their education. The difference between a well-funded school and an under-funded school makes a big difference in academic life. #publiceducation #Kto12 #teachers #CAfamilies
12K is not enough for K-12, lack of funding leads to poor performance by students and makes a teacher's living tough to sustain. @CSBA_Now @GavinNewsom @PPICNotes https://t.co/MWwEV2s42f
Homeless Homeowners? San Francisco residents who make 90-120% of the national median wage struggle to keep their homes. @housingca @CaliforniaHelp
Despite all my rage, I'm still just a chicken in a cage: the battle between confinement regulations and confinement-free housing for farm animals is not resolved, but aided with passing of Prop 12. @HumaneSociety @FarmForward @HumaneFarming
Early childhood education (ECE) opportunities are not created equal-quality and price vary. Lack of universal preschool creates an achievement gap and sets many children up for future education failure. #preschoolteachers #futureeducators #parentsofyoungchildren
Water conservation and usage is a big issue in California, especially because of frequent droughts. Water we going to do about it? #watereducation
How is it that schools only a few miles apart can be so disparate in funding and resources? Stay tuned and find out. #Sacunifiedschooldistrict #education #EGUSO #inequality
Wildfires have swept through all parts of CA at an increasingly higher rate over the past few years. Even though they have brought destruction to National Parks, homes, businesses and ecosystems, it still seems like no one is taking steps towards prevention. #PGE @SenFeinstein
Friend or foe? The frequent fatalities of force! Following death of Stephon Clark in March '18, the Sac community have requested policy changes be made in regards to Sac PD use of force rules and regulations. @XavierBecerra @Mayor_Steinberg
California has the highest levels of homelessness in the country-allocating resources to feed and shelter these people should be our focus. Increased funding to groups that help the homeless around the state should be our focus. #homelesshelp
