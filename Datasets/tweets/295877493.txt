@MattRoznowski Not irresponsible at all - it was tippy toe politics at its worst...I don‚Äôt deny they put some one time money in corridors of commerce, but they had a chance to do what they advocate for long term funding and raise gas tax and didn‚Äôt act because of politics - period

@bgolnik @DaveLislegard I‚Äôm not going to defend the DFL party on that, those 58 percent are wrong, and nobody has fought harder for mining jobs than Dave or myself, standing with your members, and the few dflers left that still support mining too - hammer away at DFL on mining, their problem not mine
@JoeCampbellMN And yes, I love the quote tweets!
@JoeCampbellMN NRA ratings....don‚Äôt matter - actions matter - she‚Äôs talking about tippy toe politics being a problem with Walz, i think it‚Äôs fair to say when she was in a position to do something as Majority Leader, I believe right after Sandy Hook, when there was momentum, nothing happened
@Tim_Walz - voted for ACA when he knew could cost him his seat in Congress b/c he thought it was right, he upset some of his friends by changing his view on gun control b/c he thought it was right, he served our country in uniform - that‚Äôs leadership, nothing tippy toe about it
Erin was the Majority Leader for 2 years when DFL controlled everything - they did nothing about gun control, did nothing about infrastructure - why?  Politics plain and simple - leading isn‚Äôt talking, it‚Äôs acting when you can - not all on her, but she was Majority Leader https://t.co/aVMZzpdAnI

@ReidfromMn Well, 13 dflers voted for more tax cuts last week - after a lot of dflers voted for tax cuts last year and the Governor signed the bill - all of that comes out of general fund - but apparently that‚Äôs more of a priority for them than fixing or roads and bridges or schools

@Bennett_R_Smith @RwGinsberg No teachers will be fired because of this amendment - that‚Äôs ridiculous - they did nothing to fund transportation term - zero - threw cash at - which is why we are here
@Bennett_R_Smith @RwGinsberg Hey Bennett - not sure if you were around, but I was - dflers in the House were the ones that refused to pass a gas tax or do anything to solve long term transportation funding issues - nothing - DFL was in total control - did nothing - just so you got that I repeated it
@RwGinsberg Taxes can be raised by statute - you prove the point, raising revenue is hard, dflers wouldn‚Äôt raise the gas tax either just a couple years ago - prioritizing less than 1 percent of the budget for infrastructure is not unreasonable - we can and should fund Roads AND Schools
@RwGinsberg Gone forever?  You and others who have concerns can advocate for an income tax increase whenever you want if you feel there isn‚Äôt enough of a pie...
Also important to note - the 300 million out of 40 plus billion budget we want to spend on roads is bankrupting every other priority in the state of Minnesota - of course that‚Äôs ridiculous, but just another day inside the Capitol bubble
So far here is what I am being told - you can spend general fund money on tax cuts, buffer zone payments and all kinds of other things with unfunded long term tails but if you dare spend .06 percent of the budget to fix roads you are bankrupting the state and closing schools - ok

@_RyanWinkler The GOP is getting more of our voters because the DFL forgot about F and L - our people didn't leave you, you left them - I'm always going to be with my members, I won't schill or sell for any party - you all need to earn our votes, does the DFL want them is the question

@_RyanWinkler Imagine yourself out there building a highway from sun up to sun down - now imagine some guy comes up to u and says u know I'm going to oppose rtw but we can't fund ur jobs because the enviros want trains and busses - imagine how much he cares about what ur preaching - get it?
@_RyanWinkler True - is that happening in MN where republicans have controlled both bodies twice now in last few years?  Nope - u like facts, did your party pass comprehensive transpo bill when you controlled everything?  Nope - facts - they cut both ways Wink
@_RyanWinkler You need new talking points - those are tired man - those talking points got half of our members voting for Trump - you want to earn our votes?  Start supporting our jobs again, start making jobs a priority - study Connor Lamb - until then take this tired shit elsewhere
@_RyanWinkler Fact of life - some, like Senator Gazelka, do support union construction trades - can't speak for other unions and how they do their politics, but for us, we don't think support for union construction workers should be a partisan issue - and we have made a lot of progress

@wonkytonkman ACA had zero republican votes - as tax bill will likely have zero democrat votes - I get they aren't being done exactly same way, but point is, neither way is how big things are supposed to be done, reason 60 votes was in place - used to be 70 votes - compromise
@knorton29 My point is don't do it if you can't find compromise - and remember, it was Harry Reid under tremendous pressure from left wing that blew up the filibuster - hows that working out now?  Same people up in arms over tax bill were screaming at Reid to forget the rules just pass ACA
@knorton29 The ACA as whole didn't have hearings my recollection, many legislators hadn't read it - all the parts of it did, attempts were made to make it bi-partisan but failed and they went ahead anyway - same thing could be said of tax bill, all the stuff in it are old known policies
left wing will say well it was ok that Obama rammed through ACA and did exec orders because those were for good - well - right wing will say same thing about what Trump is doing, it was for good cause so it's excusable - both wings of both parties are destroying America
Left wing bashing Trump for doing exactly what they screamed at Obama to do - govern by executive order and ram partisan bills through congress - right wing freaked out when Obama did this, and now is pushing Rs to do exactly same thing - had enough of both wings of both parties?

@MCEA1974 I know there is no company on earth and no amount of regs that MN could put in place to get you to support mining - which makes u a fraud

@MCEA1974 Every corporation is motivated by profit - that's why in America we have checks and balances, and why we need to make things here
@carlymelin @SenatorBenson @WatchYourRepsMN Amen @carlymelin
@MCEA1974 It does concern me - which is why I want the mining done here in MN where we have laws that prevent exploit workers or destroy environment
@SenatorBenson @WatchYourRepsMN @carlymelin Amen @SenatorBenson

@taxpayinglib I appreciate y man, and I hope that people like you win the fight - blue collar jobs should matter to everyone, good wages too
@taxpayinglib Very true - but 100 percent of republicans support mining and pipeline jobs - about 17 percent of dems do now - u see why it's complicated
@taxpayinglib Disagree Tom - not all republicans think we get paid to much - 51 republican congressman support Davis bacon prevailing wages
@mikemisterek It's more complicated than all GOP bad - which is what too many progressives do, and too many tea party types do to dflers - we need middle
@mikemisterek Plenty of dflers actively oppose good paying blue collar jobs - we don't support them - plenty support our jobs and we do support them
@mikemisterek plenty of Rs support good wages - and we support them - plenty don't and we don't support them
