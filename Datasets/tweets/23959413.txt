The real question regarding mindfulness is what ur trying to do w it. To over simplify a bit: is it to get someone to focus who is scattered? Or to get someone who is a perfectionist/task oriented to be creative? Mindfulness literally = opposite strategies depending on who/goal.
This is why yoga or directive meditation will make some people like myself angry and it shuts down my abilities to creative and problem solve. For others who have an overactive or negative default mode, it is exactly what they need if they can’t get to execution.
The problem w this article is that mindfulness if taught as a task shuts down default mode network of the brain-where creativity, empathy, sense of self/others, epiphanies reside. Bad for ppl who are already task oriented. Good 4 ppl who can’t focus  https://t.co/TMKy6qyexe

Schools of Ed---teaching systems thinking/change to teachers &amp; principals is as important as pedagogy--it is the #1 challenge faced by organizations facing societal/technological change. If you don't, teachers are fresh water fish dropped in salt water tanks. They die or leave!
@MightySkoonk Good learning is only about helping the brain create new neural pathways. Curiosity is the most powerful form of triggering this process that almost trumps pedagogy. Curiosity comes about most effectively from real world exposure &amp; relationships.
What are your "aha's" and "I wonders" from this thread?
Boards often look for a charismatic leader. Even w a well-intentioned onen w good ideas, you tend to end up with an organization of sheep by default. A great leader will figure out how to make sure there is sacred space, time, use of protocols and right people to work on issues.
Sustainability and resilience of the most important critical things come from everyone in the organization being free to use their critical thinking and brains to make thousands of adjustments--not dictation by a leader no matter how wise.
Even if you want to avoid top down leadership, you end up with that by default if you have any charisma and are able to inspire trust. It creates vulnerability and unsustainability of the very things that work when you leave.
Superintendents and principals need a whole new paradigm on how to lead that creates and inspires intrinsic motivation. Be wary of loyalists who trust your every move--because unintentionally they have shut off their brain and have become sheep even for the right idea.
Now, every person based on their experiences &amp; background have limits to their risk tolerance and agility that changes over time. True leaders have to have enough of a personal relationships w their team members to guide them--pushing their limits but not setting them up to fail.
True pivots require personal commitment &amp; intrinsic motivation to want this pivot. Anything else makes it top-down and extrinsic. No "super" leader no matter how capable or well-intentioned will make 100% right decisions. So success relies on the teams' motivation to get it right
True pivotal innovation feels like right angle or more turns. It requires a lot of trust, faith and commitment by all parties to do their part to turn the corner no matter how uncomfortable. They will do it because it is the right thing to do and w thirst for doing what is right.
There is NO scenario that EVERYONE feels comfortable with progress--even if it is the right thing to do. In every true innovation, there are ALWAYS pain points and casualties--especially to those who cannot make the pivot quick enough. It is very personal.
Having the "right idea" is not enough unless you know how to re-engineer the system to sustain it. Otherwise, you end up being only a casualty of the legacy system. A legacy incumbent system always has home advantage pitted against a new ill-defined system.
Autonomy is not enough. If everyone goes only after their own self-interest and/or what they feel is right, you don't end up with a system. You end up with random agendas and results--which may be worse than a bureaucratic system you are running away from.
There is nothing noble about being a martyr in a bureaucratic system if it doesn't cause systemic system change--you become simply a calculated casualty of the system. The science and strategy to not just becoming a martyr is in knowing the process of systems redesign.
Education innovators--there is nothing noble about persisting and having grit as a fresh water fish dropped in a salt water tank. Systems thinking/change requires that the water PH has been adjusted to support healthy practices. Otherwise, it's just a matter of time when fish die
If places of learning (e.g. school) are focused on the goal of opening up and developing new neural pathways to the brain to see and understand things differently, then how we assess progress and performance may be very different.
Bureaucracies are amazing at sustaining and perpetuating things that NO one wants. Imagine if you use the same mechanisms to perpetuate the practices and culture that make students and educators thrive.
Schools of education need to build the capacity of teachers for systems thinking and change management. Current teachers need to educate themselves on this process. Don't get caught up in fighting against something. Fight FOR something.
Teachers--it's not enough to know what you are fighting against but you need to know what you are fighting for. It can be the golden age for teachers to redesign dysfunctional systems to one that is fully aligned for the needs and potential of every child in this country!

It also calls into question the underlying design/assumptions of customer relationships management, learning management, and collaboration products.
How would you reconstruct the size and composition of your work teams?
Many successful product designers say never have more than 5 people in the room to plan or design anything. Maybe this is the natural size for #PBL teams as well? #pblchat
What implications does this have on equity? People tend to only want to work with people they are familiar with and tend to trust by design? Is social capital a big driver in inequity?
What are the attributes that make great positive and productive relationships? What are the attributes that are red flags that a relationships should be fixed or abandoned?
How should schools help students develop the skills to form and manage their relationships? It is probably one of the most important life skills.

@rpondiscio ...and schools that practice good PBL do have overall higher academic achievement rates, college acceptance and persistence. It has made a huge difference in what was once failing schools in #ElPaso city schools and across  @newtechnetwork schools that are wall to wall #PBL.
@rpondiscio Facilitated student curation of problems that they are interested in solving (unlocks the power of curiosity), look for opportunities in these projects for academic learning, bring an authentic audience and resources. It's pretty much what good PBL looks like.
A6--true problem-solving is a very NON-LINEAR messy process. You don't know what paths you need to take or what paths end up dead ends. The work simply is to explore and to figure out--even if it means you only have a map of what not to try. #whatisschool
A6 - three things schools &amp; many teachers struggle w (a) iteration and (b) calibration w authentic/real world usable solutions (c) leveraging real world out-of-school relationships. PBL projects led by teachers who don't have these skills look like poor hobby crafts #whatisschool
@davidleeedtech Yes! It takes a bit for people to not attempt at rushing to come up w the "right answer." Schools too often promote this bad behavior. Instead, I would rather quiz someone on everything they don't know rather than what they do know--that's where opportunities/risks are.
Q4 - You want the polarity of energy flow to come from students' intrinsic motivation. However, one thing you can be absolutely top-down &amp; rigid about: Sacred time and space, use of protocols and having the right people on the team. You do this, then magic happens. #whatisschool
We gleaned 5 consistent practices by the world's super creatives that can be useful to inform the creation/design of learning environments that support the most important habits/processes required for success. ---&gt;https://t.co/m5s2LZ17Ep #whatisschool
A3 - Good PBL accomplishes this well if (a) you force lots of iterations (b) you don't define an end product/result (c) you pick challenging real world problems that pros struggle with. #whatisschool
A2 why solve a problem that someone else has already solved? There are too many tough problems in the world to waste energy reinventing the wheel. All worthwhile/engaging efforts charts new territory. #whatisschool
A1 - creative problem solving looks like dozens of iterations to figure out the best solution to difficult problems. It is leveraging relationships to pick their insights and brains to help....and its learning about everyone else's success/failures to avoid repeats. #whatisschool

It doesn't matter if you are a rich kid or a poor kid in another part of the world and who may not have access to these types of conversations. We can use technology and media to break down some of these walls.
We both tremendously benefit from these super creative friends that mentor us and push us that has made us create things we didn't imagine even a few years ago. This kind of energy and thinking, I wish all students could have access to.
Even if they meet them, they may not have the context to have deep conversations with them. This is one of the reasons why @unleighshed and I created Go All Creative EDU to bring these conversations with the worlds super creatives into school PLCs, PD and staff meetings.
a3 cont.  Inequity as we know it can also simply be where you live. I live in the middle of the entertainment/creative capital of the world--where economy is driven by people making up stories :) I know not to many ppl have access to our social capital #rethink_learning
A3. Create school environments where all learning is in PBL teams and focus on maximizing each child's skills and access to relationships inside AND outside their school. Every kid needs to know at least one adult leader that changes the world for the better. #rethink_learning
@bbray27 Building social capital takes a lot of time and intentional effort with skills. Schools should be teaching this. It is interesting that some of the most effective mentors spent a lot of time coaching around how to work with ppl. #rethink_learning
@mexusmx Trying to solve equity just by doing a power or resource grab only starts a war and it is not the kind of empowering leadership we want. Otherwise, some group always gets oppressed.  #rethink_learning
@mexusmx Solving equity is a great goal but it won't happen without execution. Only way to execute is to work on building authentic trust relationships--which is a foundation of strong social capital which turns into resource capital and power capital.
@mexusmx I was part of an effort bringing ppl who owned exotic cars (some $1 million+ each) to do a day road rally w kids from disadvantaged neighborhoods. Kids figured out that rich people can actually be nice and rich people were shocked how hard working good poor kids were.
@mexusmx We need to give legitimate opportunities to build relationships/social capital with a wide diverse set of people. This goes both ways. Rich to poor and poor to rich.
A2: cont - this is why well run team PBL works brilliantly because kids end of having lots of experiences working and being productive w people they wouldn't naturally gravitate toward. #rethink_learning
A2: People only tend to give power, voice and resources to people they identify with and trust. So the only structural way to make this happen for the underrepresented is to create alternative structures that helps ppl build relationships w other types of people #rethink_learning
Hi everyone! Happy MLK. Happy to join you guys today. Q1. Giving voice is not enough. Social capital, resources and power has to go along with it. If underrepresented people don't have access, then it doesn't happen. #rethink_learning

‘Find your passion’ may be bad advice.  Instead of finding your passion, try developing it. The belief that interests arrive fully formed &amp; must simply be “found” can lead people 2 limit their pursuit of new fields &amp; give up when they encounter challenges https://t.co/vsgFlDuwFj
Think about entrepreneurship—many people can have ideas but what matters is ability to execute well. You still have to survive lots of dead end paths and have to keep adjusting—but worse if stand still from fear. #goallcreativeedu
There is a role for performance management—to measure whether the team did what they said they were going to do that we agreed to (execution-based accountability). This is very different than the mistake of high stakes accountability that surfaces only on end result symptoms.
@edsabnis It’s learning how to discover, explore, research, unpack challenges—basically how to be entrepreneurial by both inventing something and knowing how to initiate/manage systems change.
@edsabnis Right goal in my opinion: opening new neural pathways in every kids brain to maximize their whole development across social, emotional, academic, creativity, technical and preparing for skills we don’t even know that we might need in the figure.
The successful schools I work with have a powerful culture and alignment of systems that they execute precisely everything they commit to. If something doesn’t work they can execute a fix quickly. #PowerfulTeamsTrustandWorkTogether
When I work w schools having academic performance problems, the reason is never because of lack of the right goals, intention or looking at data. They have a severe misalignment of culture &amp; systems that become the barrier to executing anything well. #SystemsProblemNotTeachers

@fastcrayon The idea of the system will naturally align because of research/data and practice that is “good for kids” is false. Systems sustain even terrible practices that no one wants. There is opposite use the same system to sustain great practices.

@GingerLewman @perezhasclass @kevinhoneycutt We have found you should not have to wait for results from your own kids to get these practices in place. Seeing other schools doing it well with similar students plus studies will do the trick. Otherwise it’s like trying to prove the fish can show healthy results in salt water.
@GingerLewman @perezhasclass @kevinhoneycutt Johnny will leave if it’s bad pbl. We all have been part of meaningless and poorly run project teams. I commend the effort and willingness to try on the teachers part but it is always a race against time like the fresh water fish in salt water. Intention is not enough to survive.
@GingerLewman @perezhasclass @kevinhoneycutt Otherwise w/o the systems work, the effort dies eventually and teachers have to quit the practice to keep their jobs or move to another job or move out of the profession out of pure survival.
@GingerLewman @perezhasclass @kevinhoneycutt Teachers can be trained to do some systems redesign work in advocating what they need to do it well and get buy in by educating/studies/having principals experiencing world class pbl—and then to at least get their support to pilot.
@GingerLewman @perezhasclass @kevinhoneycutt The risk becomes without the right ecosystem—fresh water fish in salt tank. 2 competing pedagogies/culture/systems and ending up w worst of both worlds. For sustainability-Needs some system work in building to accommodate w sanction.
@GingerLewman @perezhasclass @kevinhoneycutt I think the building principal should at least make an attempt to get a policy waiver drafted with the district for this purpose.
@GingerLewman @perezhasclass @kevinhoneycutt Trying to do pbl within a pacing guide for a student is like if you hired a personal chef to cook a meal for you that accommodates your dietary needs and tastes but then the chef hands you a McDonald’s memo for you to pick from.
@GingerLewman @perezhasclass @kevinhoneycutt PBL and pacing guides are in opposing universes. Pacing guides destroy ability to personalize and make generalizations and assumptions about kids—toward the deadly average. Districts who want to do PBL right should offer board passed policy waivers from pacing guides. #pblchat

@sirnewmalot @Provokedpedagog @SirKenRobinson See the work of @bigpiclearning and @newtechnetwork —significant amount of their work is in high poverty areas.
We have to do way more to inspire and nurture creativity. What are the biggest hitters to do that? 1. Sacred flexible time 2. Sacred space that wakes up senses and emotions 3. Opportunities to connect and calibrate with other successful creatives who are pushing the edge.
Majority of people are used to working in jobs constrained in time/fixed processes. In classrooms teachers and students are put into 180 day rigid routines. Wonder why when we tell people 2b creative &amp; work on being creative we get a bunch of blank stare of disbelief &amp; inaction
We are very fortunate to live in a city that is one of the most creative cities in the world and that we have nearly complete flexibility on how we spend our time on projects that we care about. Even with that’s its hard to keep pushing that creative edge.
Here are @unleighshed and my personal top places around home for our creativity and productivity.  Some places great to rejuvenation others for solitude and others for being surrounded by other successful creatives. https://t.co/3NzCZ8CeT4

You don’t want to waste all the energy and time of the expertise on rewriting a document as agreements evolve. You want all the expertise energy helping form solid and better agreements.
On the other extreme end of the spectrum, I’m working w @unleighshed on a few film/tv projects. Haven’t figured out the workflow yet—but seems that writing too soon can waste a lot of time unless you are simply doing a VERY quick brain dump to see where all the holes are.
Can’t write anything if there are no agreements.
I’m known for helping clients develop great business plans that have raised hundreds of millions in investor and philanthropic investment. I leave the writing of the document literally to the last step. A business plan simply documents the leadership team’s agreements.
I know for me, to think, walking and talking about it is much more effective than writing. Writing locks things down too much too soon in the creative process. Writing is great to memorialize something—and still subject to 7-10 rewrites.
What do you think about this? There is no point in writing something unless someone cares to read it (not just to grade), it helps you think/remember, it’s helps you make money. How do we making writing relevant and engaging to kids in school. #edchat

@drdouggreen @TopDogTeaching @edutopia @cultofpedagogy @Lynch39083 @techedvocate @DBaker007 @guzmand @PhilipCullen @Forbes @UKMercer If structure means giving students lots of time and space to question that most classrooms don’t allow for...then I’m all for that. I’m also for having kids inventory what they know and what they need to know—making them equally comfortable with what they need to know.
@drdouggreen @TopDogTeaching @edutopia @cultofpedagogy @Lynch39083 @techedvocate @DBaker007 @guzmand @PhilipCullen @Forbes @UKMercer All these other steps just trains them to how we want them to question—which never leads to free inquiry.

@drdouggreen @TopDogTeaching @edutopia @cultofpedagogy @Lynch39083 @techedvocate @DBaker007 @guzmand @PhilipCullen @Forbes @UKMercer My experience has been that if you start with having authentic relationships w each student to understand what is relevant to them (interests, passion) you can jump to free inquiry right away.

#WeMustDoBetter #LeadWithAHeart ❤️
Strong healthy culture starts w an authentic relationship between people which opens the capacity to understand what is relevant to that person &amp; then to work together w the same motivation toward excellence. Only in this context can we properly understand any help is needed.
But it is important to address this root because everything else will become a myriad of symptoms that are difficult and/or impossible to predict and control. The more rules we lay down to compensate, the more places children fall between the cracks.
I’m not suggesting to let students be free in an instant and they will somehow do what is right. School culture of trust, respect, responsibility and excellence is a mindset that takes a few weeks or a month or two to build with intentional and aligned efforts by school teams.
In crisis OR on a normal day, if you have to create arbitrary rules to prevent bad behaviours that applies to everyone equally, you are telling a child they are capable of the lowest common denominator failure and you really don’t know or care about them enough to do better.
If a child ends up at Principal’s office for misbehavior, they already fell through a crack and had to get in trouble to get notice. If their grade is not good, they already fell through a crack bc grades tell things after the fact. If they are absent—you’ve lost your connection.
It’s the same pattern that results in all types of failures resulting in violence, aggression, suicide, bullying, untreated depression—even lack of academic achievement. #WeMustDoBetter #LeadWithAHeart
Zooming back out to the root issue...the result of a unhealthy org/school culture is that kids &amp; adults fall through the cracks. They don’t know the person well enough to know what help is needed &amp; no system so they know how to connect them to help.
We as a society need proactive/compassionate safety nets. It’s in our best interest! Society decides from time to time how much government pays and how much relies on private charity. Of course proper understanding of circumstances/screening systems are needed to prevent abuse.
Lives change. Things that can be used as a weapon can change (think of the acid, knife and vehicle attacks in Europe and Asia). Does it really matter that x number of people suffered an attack all at the same time or the same number over a week? To me NO-it’s X too many!
It becomes this vicious cycle. Has it occurred to people that any healthy person at some point in their lives could have a mental health crisis? They could have qualified for a gun permit but now shouldn’t be trusted to even drive their car.
When there is a failure of culture trust, respect, responsibility &amp; excellence-we adjust: If police aren’t protecting us we need to arm ourselves. If kid acts out uncontrollably we send them to the police. If kid somehow gets weapons of any kind we want a ban of that weapons.
A powerful school culture rooted in Trust, Respect, Responsibility and Commitment to Excellence is the foundation that is the biggest prevention of these tragedies. It can’t be just in a goal statement but engrained as part of daily routines.
Likewise a kid in crisis &amp; quickly sliding to the end of the rope needs very attentive peers, adults &amp; system of efficient support for the urgent help they need. Students should have healthy relationships with adults and each other to connect themselves and each other for help.
A student whose health/happiness index is usually a 10 but every month is sliding to a 9 then an 8...etc needs our collective understanding of what is transpiring and help. It is preventative.
Right now, I think school leaders should be having conversations with their students 10-15 at a time (no obtuse town halls) with mindset of collaboration/compassion/empathy toward each other to recognize when someone needs help &amp; how to connect them with it.
We owe our nation’s children more! If there is any child who needs the right help and interventions to prevent tragedy to themselves and/or others whether suicide, violence, addictions we as a society must be willing &amp; organized to anticipate &amp; proactively provide them that help.
The root cause of this national crisis (in my opinion) is not guns or mental health (these are the tools and symptoms). It is us letting kids fall through the gaping cracks in our adult-run institutions (law enforcement, schools, health services, etc). #NoHelpWhenNeeded
This IS a national crisis not some minor thing. Kids are dying! Kids have a right to speak their mind. It’s their lives and safety—and their views/solutions, whether we agree or not, is protected as a basic right in our country’s Constitution.
This is the common thread of the string of negligent failures that led to the tragedy at #StonemanDouglas where too many adults did not do what they were supposed to do that could have saved lives. We need to show kids that we have their back and will work with them.

@d_k_lewis @facebook @robjective It appears that most ads were purchased after the election. This is contrary to what media wants the narrative to be.

This is not a partisan statement on my part. Any leader from any political affiliation can fall to our country’s opponents if their own or their team’s ego clouds their lens to prevent seeing clearly and respecting the opponent’s adversarial capabilities, intentions and deception

It is a national travesty where generations of kids are spending the majority of their time (280+ days 6+ hrs/day 12-20 years) growing up disengaged. Shouldn’t be schools be the opposite—places of engagement, discovery and self-enhancement?
Isn’t it appalling to educators what proportion of time students are not engaged in a traditional school setting?
They usually say there was only one class they were not bored. I ask them about their experience in the #deeperlearning school—they say they are never bored or there’s this one traditional class they are bored in.

@KatherineStier @JeremyDBond Some resources to study: 1. https://t.co/ZQkvVp21zV 2. https://t.co/seu2f69iU5  3. https://t.co/cLTVEz27jz
@JeremyDBond @KatherineStier Schools don't have to do all the student-led conference all in one night or two...they can spread it out evening throughout a period of time...and even Facetime/Skype in families during the process. It is important to have a well designed physical place/some tech in place.
@KatherineStier @JeremyDBond What is crazy is that it doesn't cost any more time or resources to implement this. It just changes who is driving what and implementation of intentional protocols and shifts work flow/load to be more evenly spread.
@JeremyDBond @KatherineStier I've seen kindergarten students do it...it is quite amazing to see how capable students at this age are--being reflective, asking for help, showing their work. Schools that do this well report it has significantly improved student/teacher/family relationships and the fun level!
@JeremyDBond @KatherineStier I guess if student agency processes aren't in place like they should be, having teachers journal daily and weekly about their entire class may help so they aren't just focusing on what just happened in the near term but can articulate a longer-term perspective.
@JeremyDBond @KatherineStier Short of that, family/teacher connections are hard to build because teacher has to try to customize their discussion with couple dozen families---and most end up being very basic/limited conversations about behavior, grades and motivation.
@JeremyDBond @KatherineStier Student-led conferences have to be a structured/facilitated process...that usually includes student's journaling their work daily and reviewing with teachers weekly. Lack of supportive agency processes are the #1 reason why student-led ends up being not effective.
@msbmcneil @tombennett71 I hated piano lessons...until I had a very special teacher that taught me composition using my creativity. There is definitely a rote/horrible way to learn to play piano and a good way that engages--with a positive possible byproduct of shaping brain development differently.
@JeremyDBond @KatherineStier The issue is student agency. When the learning process puts the student in the center of learning w agency, w student led conferences, students are in best position to advocate for their work/where they need help. When it's teacher/parent led, it creates a polar opposite dynamic
Student Led Conferences - turns the dreaded parent-teacher conference into something engaging and powerful. Parent-teacher conferences should be banned. https://t.co/OX1Ga5dkHV #deeperlearning #edchat #pblchat #stemed #edpolicy

An attribute of a successful creator is they know when what they have created is exemplary and good enough. Creatives often so hard on themselves and want perfection. That’s why finding the balance between design and conditions is important. This sb learned in school too
If you are serious about helping your students develop their creativity skills, how are you allowing and encouraging them to identify and utilize what it takes to optimize the creative mind. Would my HS have allowed me to take a nap?
A driving question for educators is how your school is intentionally helping kids at each age to hands-on practice these skills. Are you comfortable in having kids not get the perfect solution the 1st time? How about the 20th time? #deeperlearning #pblchat #pbl #edleadership
@KYTOY15 Exactly 😂
I don’t like the term “hacking” because to me it implies lack of engineering and cobbling something together. Each iteration attempt is always a serious effort to be the final product but always being open minded and prepared to be honest when it’s not enough.
Almost everything I’ve been involved with that is innovative and breaks new ground required a dozen to two dozen iterations—half of the iterations required a restart from scratch and rebuilding based on what was learned.
Any good idea, invention has a certain environment and conditions by which it will work and conversely ones that will cause it to break. You keep experimenting (sometimes many iterations) to find the acceptable balance between design and conditions.
Failure=not learning and not working to find a better path and standing still not going anywhere.
@byers_brandy Yes!!! Companies I work with would rather hire (by a large margin) someone with project management and leadership skills that need technical training rather than someone that has technical w/o project management/leadership skills.
As an entrepreneur, I don’t think in terms of failure and embracing it. Instead, everything (ideas, designs, product, protocols) need to be stress tested because everything has a breaking point and it’s valuable to know where that is. You rebuild/restart because of what you learn

@mthornton78 Too many stop at just the first part and half do next part
@mthornton78 The process each and every team member goes through to discover and be in alignment and agreement is more important than the words that end up on the page. Then shifting into process of forming agreements around how this will be accomplished is 90% of the success work.
I would add that it's not enough to define what accountable means but you have to make sure the people are only accountable for the things they have authority/control and that the system doesn't get in the way. #edpolicy #edreform #edchat https://t.co/uSR6qeZC3i

@NanaKathy22 Well said.
Now that we know you want to win at NFL football, and you are a NFL team not something else. What’s missing is the playbook, protocols on team building/practice and agreements re how players work w the team. As a school, what’s your teams playbook, protocols, agreements?
The mission and vision statement of a school is only the first step and is insufficient by themselves to ensure execution. A football team analogy: vision-we have more super bowl wins than anyone. Misson: we are an NFL football team. (Not ball maker, not collegiate).
@meljordyn When any member of the team have no say, there is no alignment and positive engagement is compromised — there is no agreement—just dictation. Legitimate agreements require all parties to have power to agree or disagree. How decisions are made in many school systems isn’t this.

Building strong healthy relationships with peers and students is more than just spending time. You already spend 8hrs a day together. Specific practices on how you use that time exponentially increases chance you form great relationships rather than leaving it to chance.
I’ve observed that educators also mistake “intentions” for the same thing as “intentionality”. Intentionality to me requires the elements of 1. Working toward and end in mind 2. Setting up system/environment to support vs get in way 3. Getting agreement/alignment w participants.
It seems to me that almost all schools and districts’ (whether high performing g or low performing) misson and vision statements essentially are the same, just worded differently. Difference is the alignment and clarity of HOW specifically is this going to be achieved.
@DrCWebbBAPhD And agreement/alignment around how team intends to execute.
@GMPrincipal_100 We observed that a powerful culture for a new or a redesign school can be reset over a summer and it sets the tone within the first 1-2 months and the solidifies by 2nd semester. This repeated over 2-3 yrs creates sustainability because culture becomes part of institutional dna

@JoAnneGross1 However there are certain practices that help personalize better...teachers need to know these best practices, learn how to do and not work in a vacuum making it up.
Too many educators I’ve worked with make be mistake of assuming that setting goals is what produces performance improvement. Goals are great but where most schools run into trouble is not having agreement about how to execute. Execution is everything!
Strong positive school cultures don’t happen just by setting the goal and good intentions-it requires creating intentional and routine time, space &amp; facilitating protocols to bring people together to form relationship of trust, respect, responsibility and commitment to excellence
