"Unless we get organized and make our voices heard by mayors, councils, and city officials." ‚Äì@WilliamLaurance from @ALERTconserv &amp; @TESSJCU Read the essay here: https://t.co/0oGojpe7pi
"Wealthy developers are gobbling up valuable urban land and turning burgeoning #cities into unhealthy concrete islands. The power of special interests is, simply, overwhelming...
"And yet alarmingly, most ‚Äòurban‚Äô planning is barely planning at all‚Äîespecially in developing nations, which are growing the fastest...
"The air we breathe, the water we drink, the life we enjoy, and our experiences (or not) with #nature will all rely crucially on how we design and build our #cities ... https://t.co/JDutzRN2Ui @nate_berg
