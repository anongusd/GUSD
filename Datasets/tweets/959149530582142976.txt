@OK_Dumbass @AOC So what, Trump is not taking away our means of transportation (some of us really do go to work) Go figure ???  Some even use planes &amp; automobiles üöó to do this.  Imagine that??
@AOC Your KILLING AMERICA.  That‚Äôs your plan.  Get out of your van, stay off your plane or is this a socialist rule that does not apply to you.  We will be throwing every dollar we can against you. No planes your NUTS.
@RandPaul vote how your constituents want you to vote on the.  You are only a representative no one cares how you feel.  Do your job and vote your People‚Äôs vote. Enough of your horse trading.
@AOC No whites you racist.  No Indians or Mexicans you racist. Your such a racist and thisTweet your racist parade
@JimKuther @100PercFEDUP INVESTIGATE we need a House investigation.
@johnwhitjr @SpeakerPelosi @JoaquinCastrotx @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @SaraCarterDC @RealJamesWoods @seanhannity @RepMattGaetz @senatemajldr @RudyGiuliani The BEST TWEET OF THE DAY! We are following you to. It‚Äôs not legislation it foolish obstruction and Pelosi knows it.
@JimScofield5 @Skippphipps @SpeakerPelosi @JoaquinCastrotx @realDonaldTrump The labor pool of illegal Mexicans alone has kicked the butts of American trade workers (painters, framers, carpenters) like no other. Billions of $$$ in welfare, education &amp; healthcare. Human trafficking, Mexican gangs &amp; drugs.  How is all this cool for your children?
@MoteTracey @Skippphipps @SpeakerPelosi @JoaquinCastrotx @realDonaldTrump Your right my friend, they have no real candidate for 2020 &amp; put Trump in a second term w/having nothing to lose over 4yrs &amp; a serious AG by his side.  LOOK OUT GITMO the yard is going to fill up real fast.  As it should.
@broadbarrell @Skippphipps @SpeakerPelosi @JoaquinCastrotx @realDonaldTrump There were no world wars (a serious &amp; deadly event) before the first one either. There is a FIRST TIME FOR EVERYTHING.
@BaylesMarival @Skippphipps @SpeakerPelosi @JoaquinCastrotx @realDonaldTrump It is an emergency he said he didn‚Äôt have p do it if the Dems would see the value in securing America‚Äôs borders rather than keeping it a FREE FOR ALL.
@Skippphipps @SpeakerPelosi @JoaquinCastrotx @realDonaldTrump Right on brother! Yeah, answer that Nancy!
@SpeakerPelosi @JoaquinCastrotx @realDonaldTrump Give it a rest already Nancy.  Bill Clinton use Emergency Funding SEVENTEEN (17) TIMES  &amp; so other Presidents including Obama.  Trump is well within the boundaries of the law AND YOU KNOW THIS.
@SpeakerPelosi @JoaquinCastrotx @realDonaldTrump You have yet to convince Biden to run for President. 		With Biden being the only Democrat capable of giving Trump any type of run for his office you stand in the way of securing America‚Äôs borders.  		Listen to the other Dems running they have nothing &amp; you know this too.
@JeffFlake Biden will kick your ass in the 2020 primaries....oh that‚Äôs right, your running as a Republican.  Hell, who knew???
@JeffFlake How funny Jeff,  judging by these Tweets even Democrats also see you as a big coward.  		There goes any foolish ideas you had about beating Trump in 2020 w/moderates voters.  Moderates don‚Äôt want a wishy washy coward for President.
@JeffFlake You were an Arizona Senator(????)&amp; cannot see the emergency? You saw it when OBAMA saw it. Now that Trump sees it your looking at a DONKEY.  		We vote YOU(Jeff Flake) as the ‚ÄúBEST LIBERAL DEMOCRAT of ALL TIME‚Äù Tell us where to forward your award.
RT @PhyllisHolman17: @CongressionalW5 https://t.co/O2apw00jes
@krassenstein One is beginning to think your extremely PARANOID for no sound reason whatsoever.  A doctor can help you with that.....Just tell him/her you‚Äôre a Democrat.
@MichaelAvenatti Your alright Michael, we don‚Äôt agree on many things political but your a smart guy who‚Äôs not afraid to call himself out as your doing here. I respect that &amp; always value your comments. Hope to see you in the Dems Primary.  If won, It would be a blast watching you &amp; Trump go at it
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Nancy‚Äôs wall around her home https://t.co/3u08ou48jF
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Nice Wall Nancy! We want one too???? https://t.co/bliC28Aorq
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Trafficking humans, drugs, gangs, weapons &amp; illegals that cost American taxpayers billions of $ annually is an emergency.  Build that wall.  If Mexico has to provide for all their people wanting US assistance then Mexico paid.
@krassenstein Mueller??  He‚Äôs still has nothing directly related to TRUMP (HIMSELF)/Russia that was illegal.  		Let it go Louie! You got nothing &amp; it would be funny expect for all the US tax $$ wasted.  		If you Tweet all day are you paying any income taxes?  I get it &amp; .@AOC still flys.
@AOC We beg you .AOC to end the brutality of defenseless unborn children Plan Parenthood slaughters daily.  How much money did these baby killers give you??????
@MCHduh @Cplallen @davidhogg111 Whether the alive child is inside or outside of the womb before or after birth makes it no less or more of a baby.
@krassenstein Bush came b4 Obama &amp; Obama b4 Trump.  		We forget your audience believes Trump started separating children whose parents are criminals held up in an adult jail.
@LARtRVBxFZaM4fw @PylmanThomas @KarenChowdhury @TheTiaMari_Oz @krassenstein @AOC Thank you all her supporters see is ‚ÄúFREE‚Äù &amp; are blind too who will ‚ÄúPAY.‚Äù  This is how folks like .@AOC gets elected.  They dig up voters who know less than they do. People who believe money really does grows on trees after all if .@AOC says it‚Äôs so it must be so.  Unbelievable
@KarenChowdhury @TheTiaMari_Oz @krassenstein Ask Bush &amp; Obama.  Obama claimed the children were protected from adults in an adult jail.  That‚Äôs where you want children to stay when their parents break the law? Bush also liked separating children from criminals (parents) as does Trump &amp; Obama.
@krassenstein You idiot other administrations separated or protect (as Obama put it) children from families.  The parents broke the law &amp; you want the kids to go to an adult jail w/them.  That presents many problems you dumb bell.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump It won‚Äôt work twice Nancy you PROMISED to negotiate.  Trump is just giving you every chance to do something B4 he uses Emergency funding.  Remove your spiteful hate for Trump &amp; get it together.
@krassenstein ‚Äúa bigoted racist fight against an imaginary enemy‚Äù   You forgot ‚Äúmanufactured crisis‚Äù in your sentence.  		Obama, Pelosi, Schumer &amp; Sec. Hillary publicly stated otherwise when they wanted a wall or B4 Trump promised a wall. Unbelievable
@krassenstein Please share 5 ways the Clinton Foundation (CF) is fighting HIV &amp; AIDS? 		1.	2.	3.	4.	5.
@krassenstein ‚ÄùThe Clinton Foundation?‚Äù Right, you do your homework.  		The CF found a community ridden w/HIV &amp; exploited it, Bill spoke for a fee &amp; kept it, Hillary rarely if ever mentioned HIV on campaign, daughter is too busy chasing Plan Parenthood‚Äôs money for her MILLION $ CF salary.
@Zorkmid34 @lp398vc @MichaelAvenatti Of course, cite the WP.  I claimed; lowering taxes, DEREGULATION + renegotiating US/Mex/Canada &amp; letting sm bus. out of Obamacare created more jobs for Trump.  		Please share:	WHAT 5 OBAMA ACTIONS ALLOW OBAMA  TO CREATE MORE JOBS?		1.	2.	3.	4.	5.	(I can name 5 anti-job actions)
@SenFeinstein Who cares what your disappointment in!  If you worked w/the President rather than running to the Ninth Circuit for petty BS you may have had a chance.  You FEINSTEIN destroyed your party by being petty.  It‚Äôs falling.
@krassenstein I think Republicans want Mueller‚Äôs findings more that wise Dems do
@krassenstein It‚Äôs going to be so ‚ÄúBIG.‚Äù  What could it be?  NOTHING!  He‚Äôs got NOTHING.  		But don‚Äôt worry the Dems will keep looking for something &amp; b4 they know it 2020 is here and the Dems have NOTHING to show for while controlling the House.  		They put all their eggs in ONE basket
@Migard32 @CSmith4535 @krassenstein Then why did Obama, Hillary, Pelosi, Schumer all want a ‚ÄúWALL‚Äù b4 Trump wanted a ‚ÄúWALL?‚Äù  The border is not safe		But let‚Äôs say that it is.  		?: How long b4 it becomes unsafe &amp; the Democrats again start asking to build a wall or dense or barrier again?

@dreadboze @Migard32 @CSmith4535 @krassenstein And how far did ‚Äúsolar‚Äù go for Obama???

@AOC Great, we will let you make the 1st donation.  In fact can we all see how much you give or do for charity?? 		You are no billionaire but you are party to a large group of self-serving individuals (Congress) NEVER cough up their own $$$$ for their own causes.
@krassenstein This should get Trump impeached.... what do ya think? Dems ya gota lov‚Äôem
@AdamSchiff Every time a AG starts sniffing around you Adamstart making a lot of noise.  One wonders what your hiding???
@krassenstein It was a made up story unbelievable your killing your own party.  How about the worst part was liberal journalism again is proven untrue.  You support fraud.
@krassenstein Take Trump of of Twitter and who will the Left blame for cancer, poverty, immigration, racism, losing an election, the sky being blue and poor box office results????? You/the Left needs Trump
@krassenstein Twitter would never let Trump go you dimwit.  90% of their action is related to Trump.  100% of your comments are related to Trump.
@krassenstein Build the wall and keep America SAFE!
@krassenstein If you don‚Äôt see a problem with Nancy your kidding yourself.  She is a lunatic.  She is only pulling this BS because the Dems can not beat Trump on their own so the obstruct.  You know this.
@SpeakerPelosi This is MORE about you not giving Trump a WIN than keeping America safe.  This will backfire on you in 2020
@SpeakerPelosi Secure our boarders.  MEXICO IS SECURING ITS BORDERS now.
@krassenstein How about he is a greasy slime ball who believes that anyone who is against Trump is allowed special privilege.
@deanearlcarley @krassenstein Ask the 99% (who works) how their 401k‚Äôs are doing?  How many people do they know who want to work can not find work?
@krassenstein Why doesn‚Äôt Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez .@AOC suggest CUTTING SPENDING (do her job) rather than taxing.  		Anyways it‚Äôs a foolish idea that won‚Äôt even get past the House.  All .@AOC is doing is kidding people like you that she as poor as you are.   She‚Äôs NOT.
@Migard32 @Alexandreaherr @CSmith4535 @krassenstein It‚Äôs always about skin color to Dems. You tell all the women&amp;children being trafficked as slaves through the borders it‚Äôs ‚Äúsafe&amp;secure.‚Äù Do you even know how many tons of drugs went through the Mexican-US border, Officers killed, children from Central America exploited? Not safe
@Seriously_usa_ @JsnBlackwell1 @PeltFrelken @CSmith4535 @krassenstein What is pathetic is in 2006, then-Sen Obama, Sen Schumer &amp; Sen Clinton voted for a fence &amp; wall.  		Because the Democrats can not beat Trump in 2020 on their own they are holding national security hostage &amp; will waste time investigating instead of legislating. You can‚Äôt see this?
@Seriously_usa_ @JsnBlackwell1 @PeltFrelken @CSmith4535 @krassenstein No 1 is crying/whining where it once was a knowledgeable discussion on Twitter its now just Dem raunchy. 	Your right, when I read shit like you write I just shake my head, wonder what barn you were raised in &amp; think why bother.  Like gun control idiot named tagged insured by S&amp;W
@Seriously_usa_ @JsnBlackwell1 @PeltFrelken @CSmith4535 @krassenstein When someone say f-off their not being tough their being stupid &amp; because they often have nothing constructive or no facts they resort to ‚ÄúF-off.‚Äù  It‚Äôs Twitter where Dems get away with being dicks if they want.  		No one cry‚Äôs instead why waste your time w/a ‚ÄúF-off‚Äù idiot.
@JsnBlackwell1 @PeltFrelken @CSmith4535 @krassenstein Your message says it all.  Anyone who thinks different is a ‚Äúpiece of shit.‚Äù  Don‚Äôt worry many of Twitter Dems act the same way you do. No facts just belligerent cussing you narrow minded dumbass.
@Alexandreaherr @CSmith4535 @krassenstein Clinton had the government shut down for 21 days.  We were fine.  Get the Dems to agree to safe &amp; secure boarders the same way they did in 2006 &amp; 2010.
@PeltFrelken @CSmith4535 @krassenstein Only on Twitter where only half (if that) is ever posted if it supports Trump. 		Many gave up on Twitter where your told to F-off or called a piece of shit if you disagree w/a Democrat.  Such a lovely bunch.
@CSmith4535 @krassenstein Why would anyone?  With the Dems doing everything &amp; anything to resist &amp; obstruct  and the number or RINOS bitching about wanting to spend more money like the Dems.  Forget it.  Plus all the crap the MSM &amp; social media sell.  You can not offer anything to a friend.
@krassenstein A moron, idiot, 5th or 6th grade dummy who is a billionaire &amp; President.  You forget he is NOT a politician &amp; new to this game.  You run &amp; do it better loud mouth know it all.  Your not so smart after all.  Just a critical sideline kind of a guy or gal.
@brithume .@MittRomney is a SNAKE &amp; always will be.  He‚Äôs like .@JeffFlake they will do or say anything to get elected but once elected it‚Äôs all about themselves again.
@UsPurplePeople @krassenstein Most economic indicators say otherwise.  What‚Äôs your 401k doing? For most except Twitter Dems, MS-13 &amp; illegals searching for a free ride, immigration attorneys &amp; low rated MSM life is good w/Trump.  Oh Trump is not resigning because a bunch of whining libs say he should
@krassenstein DOW is rallying in strong positive territory or did Obama do this too.
@krassenstein Your an idiot, Trump is going to leave because you think the Obama doom &amp; gloom years were better than it is now?  		You don‚Äôt get it all you do is this Twitter.  Run for office if you can be anything other than be a Monday morning quarterback.  Thanks to Trump we are doing GREAT
@TotterdownAndy @CBishop92539993 @SenBlumenthal Yeah It was pretty foolish to think anyone using Twitter to be an open minded critical thinker.  Only a lot of F-bombs, insults &amp; never a facts to validate their BS on Twitter. ‚ÄúGhetto‚Äù is a word that comes to mind.  Your right I was foolish. Thanks dude!
@Naweti @DebbieKuhl @krassenstein @FoxNews Obama‚Äôs campaign violations happened in 2008, Benghazi 2012 &amp; in 2015 Hillary admitted to using a private server for her emails. Trump became President on Jan. 20, 2017. Trump formally launched his run for President on June 16th, 2015.  Up to then he was just a private citizen.
@Naweti @DebbieKuhl @krassenstein @FoxNews I never said I had an issue with this you brought up FOX‚Äôs coverage &amp; I thought I would share who covered it &amp; when.  		It‚Äôs all rigged: 	Hillary&amp;DNC rigged it against Bernie, Google, Russia did smthng w/Trump, CNN gives Hillary the debate ?‚Äôs early, illegal voting, hanging chads
@michaeljashmore @americawins49 @dhawky014 Shortly after Obama left this was completed for all members of Congress &amp; Cabinet officials.  I have it somewhere &amp; will forward it.  I think 92%  of those who were not millionaires entering Congress had spouses or children who became millionaires while they were in Congress.
@TotterdownAndy @CBishop92539993 @SenBlumenthal Yes we already know. Twitter has banned &amp; censored us over political differences often.  Call me foolish but one would think an opposing view would be welcomed rather than silenced.
@LmaoHoldThisL @K8smommyLisa @golfnwilly @SenBlumenthal @rimarthag Fine ONE person who isn‚Äôt bias one way or the other &amp; has an opinion about Mueller‚Äôs investigation good or bad.  However we still need an AG.
@Ludikins @SenBlumenthal @lfkraus Just admit you have no idea what or if if Trump &amp; Whitaker are even conspiring much less if they have anything to cover up.  Where‚Äôs Mueller? Do you think he found something by now?
@golfnwilly @K8smommyLisa @SenBlumenthal @rimarthag Than we have to lock up every1 in DC. Senator Richard Blumenthal ethics: In a May 2010 investigation, the Times reported Sen Blumenthal, then Connecticut‚Äôs AG, often claimed to be a war hero during the Vietnam War. He was stateside In Marine Corp Reserve not Vietnam. Ethics?
@golfnwilly @K8smommyLisa @SenBlumenthal @rimarthag In our attempts to better understand both sides including the extremists we open ourselves up to the QAnon people no different than we did w/MoveOn.org.  		To date I don‚Äôt believe we have cited any QAnon or https://t.co/jWk8Agicqt material.
@Naweti @DebbieKuhl @krassenstein @FoxNews Wall Street Journal, New York Times &amp; than FOX news. Washington Post gave it a brief piece the following day
@Naweti @DebbieKuhl @krassenstein Maybe if you read few diff newspapers, bias of both the Left &amp; Right &amp; watched CNN, FOX &amp; CNBC you‚Äôd know this.		You may discover both sides of the aisle are infested w/crooks who only care about their next election. Dems have NO 1 to beat Trump in 2020 so investigate him.
@Naweti @DebbieKuhl @krassenstein January 2013, Mr. Obama‚Äôs 2008 campaign paid a $375,000 penalty to the Federal Election Commission, largely for failing to file ‚Äú48-Hour Notices.‚Äù F.E.C. rules require campaigns to notify the commission of contributions totaling $1,000 or more within 48 hours of receiving them.
@Naweti @DebbieKuhl @krassenstein An FEC audit of Obama for America's 2008 records found the committee failed to disclose millions of dollars in contributions and dragged its feet in refunding millions more in excess contributions. 		Obama was guilty &amp; later returned the$. CNN&amp;MSM was extremely quiet about this
@cm_merlin @SenBlumenthal Really?
@lets_past @krassenstein @NRA We AGREE!
@DebbieKuhl @krassenstein Same reason Democrats did nothing to keep Obama or Sec. Clinton in check. It would be political suicide.
@alonsob_exmsft @krassenstein Who has Congess recently declared war with?
@alonsob_exmsft @krassenstein The scope of treason was specifically restricted in the United States Constitution. Article III, section 3 reads as follows:		Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort.
@alonsob_exmsft @krassenstein No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.
@alonsob_exmsft @krassenstein The Congress shall have Power to declare the Punishment of Treason, but no Attainder of Treason shall work Corruption of Blood, or Forfeiture except during the Life of the Person attainted.
@CHScindy @krassenstein Please ask the good Senator, we bet he will ignore you.  If the Dems go after the NRA‚Äôs political donations surely Plan Parenthood ‚Äôs political donations will be examined and its 10x worse w/every Congressional Democrat‚Äôs  name on those books.  They are quiet for a reason.
@Jamesshoop9 @krassenstein It's not.	The Obama campaign was only fined by the FEC for failing to disclose the sources of 1,300 large donations, which together accounted for nearly $1.9 million. 		Most US Presidents have had campaign finance violations in the past. Clinton&amp;China was a big story and nothing.
@lets_past @krassenstein @NRA NO DIFFERENT THAN Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc., is recognized as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation by the Internal Revenue Service.  They both spend a bazillion $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ on political campaigns.  Go figure!
@krassenstein Was it that nickel or this nickel which one was it? Let's get the taxpayers to pay for an investigation and an audit to see what nickel it was.  		Plan Parenthood does stuff like this all the time.  Be careful you might get your party's BIGGEST doner tied in just the same.
@krassenstein Bill Clinton kind of set the bar pretty high when it comes to abusing women and maybe the reason so few care about Trump‚Äôs issues w/women.   Crazy hey?
@Ludikins @SenBlumenthal @lfkraus He can not because he is not covering anything up &amp; not is he getting in Mueller‚Äôs way.   What are they conspiring to do?  Or what are they covering up? Please tell us!
@OnlyWhiteTiger @SenBlumenthal He is not obligated to recuse himself just ask the good Senator.
@CBishop92539993 @SenBlumenthal Maybe Richard is not giving you the full story.  Richard is lying again by not telling you everything or they would had removed him already.
@cm_merlin @SenBlumenthal That's it maybe Trump conspired to blackmail him to do something he is not obligated to do.  I say we investigate this conspiracy to conspire while colluding to obstruct.  One of those has to work to impeach. Where's Mueller anyways?
@Gavcam83Alex @SenBlumenthal Lying like he did  for 12 years to the people of Connecticut, as their Attorney General, that he was a ‚Äùgreat Marine War Hero‚Äù &amp; spoke of his many near death battles.  		He was stateside in the Marine Corp Reserve, NEVER IN VIETNAM DURING THE WAR.
@SenBlumenthal Senator Richard Blumenthal for 12 years YOU lied &amp; told the people of Connecticut, as their Attorney General, that YOU were a great Marine War Hero‚Äù &amp; spoke of your many near death battles.  		You were stateside in the Marine Corp Reserve, SO WHY SHOULD WE BELIEVE YOU NOW?
@ManhREpro @SenBlumenthal Richard is part of the Senate where the GOP is the majority.  The upcoming House Majority is only making a bunch of noise knowing whatever they dish out to Trump it will NEVER get by the Senate &amp; wasting everone‚Äôs time &amp; money.
@LUpthegrove @SenBlumenthal No
@K8smommyLisa @SenBlumenthal @rimarthag For what reason? We beg anyone to give us a qualified reason!
@SenBlumenthal Richard please tell these people Whitaker has no obligation to recuse himself and he is not defying any DOJ ethics. Mueller has had no one, even Trump stand in his way and still has nothing. This will backfire on the Dems the closer Mueller waits to say he has nothing.
@SenBlumenthal Richard, the legal walls are only closing in by any means is that the Dems in Congress &amp; the DNC know they are too weak to beat Trump in 2020.  It will backfire on you in 2020 &amp; possibly bring down the Democrats party.  Not to long ago the DNC was financially grasping for air.
@RealOmarNavarro @American_Mirror Unfortunately, she won the election. Shocking but a disappointing fact.  Now we all have to put up w/her garbage.  We hope you have a better plan then exposing her home. We already know she's a crook &amp; a little old lady.  Omar kick her ass

@JeffFlake That‚Äôs very GOOD news for Republicans &amp; Conservatives!  You vote like a Democrat.  		Unfortunately, because you have your eye on 2020 your going to hold up 21 judicial nominees so you can get some attention from a few moderates?		It‚Äôs always all about Jeff.

@RepAdamSchiff Of course you will Adam. Your given the House back &amp; so far little to nothing is mentioned w/respect to legislating.  		Instead it‚Äôs all investigations &amp; the healthcare &amp; immigration reform promised to Dem voters take a back seat.  		That‚Äôs always your game Adam!

@jdmathes @tinymuel2002 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @GOP @HillaryClinton YES &amp; since before Obama left the White House (Rep Jim Jordan &amp; company have issued subpoenas for said info).

@themares1 @AdamSchiff @RepAdamSchiff Please name 5 things Rep Adam Schiff has successfully accomplished for California while in Congress.  HE WHINES &amp; BLAMES		STOP KIDDING YOURSELF
@AdamSchiff Adam, California is a FAILING MESS &amp; only leading in homelessness, drug addictions, occupied tents.  It's sad &amp; filthy. 		How about you start cleaning up your own mess.
@me_mgtwy @AdamSchiff @PhoenixArielle Countries (including the USA) have been monitoring, spying, meddling and attempting to control the political climate in foreign countries for a bazillion years. 		This is not new people.  Only thing new is the Obama‚Äôs failure in 2016 to confront it.
@RealOmarNavarro @realDonaldTrump @RepMaxineWaters Omar now is not the time to be foolish or alienate any voter on the Right or Moderate. 		This is exactly what the Washington Swamp &amp; RINO‚Äôs wants you to Tweet.  		Be a WINNER &amp; please delete your Tweet. 		TRUMP DOES NOT WANT MAXINE WATERS ANYWHERE MUCH LESS IN THE HOUSE.
@SGT_RAYRAY @AdamSchiff A few benefits @POTUS‚Äôs leadership:		-Taxes cut	-Regulations reduced	-Faster economic growth	-Lowest unemployment in 40 years	-Wages rising	-Out of Iran deal	-Embassy in Jerusalem	-Hostages home from North Korea	-New NAFTA	-Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh	-80+ judges confirmed
@JeffFlake Your kidding right? Have you seen any political ad (yours included)? 		A few days b4 mid-terms and you want some things ignored.  		America needs people like that ruthless cop killer vetted and kicked out. He killed cops and innocent people. Obama made it easy for MS-13 thugs
@SGT_RAYRAY @AdamSchiff If that Caravan was able I make it here by Tuesday and the media was publishing photos of injured children &amp; women trying to get in.  		Who would voters blame? GOP		Just like the 2014 photos of separated caged children... Trump &amp; GOP got hammered when it was Obama's policies.
@SGT_RAYRAY @AdamSchiff Many reasons:  Congress (Dems &amp; GOP)run on empty promises &amp; w/Trump deregulating, cutting corp. taxes &amp; working on balancing trade Dems can‚Äôt take credit for the economy.  		GOP failed at replacing Obamacare.  So Dems picked Healthcare &amp; was hoping on immigration reform 4 votes.
@803front @AdamSchiff Sen. Ted Cruz has made several attempts to reform our immigration system from 	Obama‚Äôs policies which encouraged drug smuggling, child abusers, murderers, dangerous MS-13 &amp; human trafficking immigrant children into the U.S. 		Democrats refuse to let go of Obama's policies
@AdamSchiff Adam, what is wrong w/asking a candidate for Senate if immigrants should be able to illegally enter the U.S. &amp; if his campaign $$ was used to fund illegal activity? 		*Beto funding this Caravan put everyone in Texas at risk &amp; wasted the caravan people‚Äôs time &amp; energy.
@Anonsource7 @contributenoah @RepAdamSchiff Because there was no collusion.  Also, Congress has not declared war on Russia so the whole Dems idea of Treason by Trump won't apply. 		Adam like the other Dem leaders know this.  		They also know many who vote for them understand very little about our legislative framework.
@copperbird7 @contributenoah @RepAdamSchiff It takes a little more than a majority vote in the House.  		Andrew Johnson &amp; Bill Clinton; were acquitted by the Senate (who votes in private) &amp; Richard Nixon was commenced, but not completed, he resigned from office before the full House voted on the articles of impeachment.
@contributenoah @RepAdamSchiff Actual impeachment of a federal public official is a rare.		Demands for impeachment, esp. of presidents, are common going back to the admin of George Washington. 		Almost all of them were deemed frivolous &amp; buried as soon as they were introduced &amp; so too will Dems demand of Trump
@contributenoah @RepAdamSchiff Again, what would the Democrats be impeaching President Trump for? 		Even if the Dems got a 50% majority in the House, the Senate needs 2/3 &amp; not every Dem (esp. those seeking independent/moderate voters in 2020) will vote to impeach &amp; many GOP NeverTrumpers are leaving in Nov.
@RoscopeMike @RepAdamSchiff Thank you!  I was just wondering the same thing.

@mincanada There is a six-pack of your favorite beer in the deal if Trump's FAIR trade causes unemployment to rise in the US.  Actually, I believe a more balanced trade will increase employment in the US.  Trump's tariffs are his means of RE-negotiating towards FAIR trade not war.

@SenSanders Give it up Bernie and the I'll-informed left.  Trump golfing at MarLago is a lot cheaper than the billions Obama gave to terrorist Iran or Hillary giving 1/5 of our Uranium away to get Russians to give millions to the Clinton Foundation.

@NancyPelosi @DevinNunes Then you Nancy should be really upset with Hillary's bathroom server.  Your a hypocritical joke, too bad your constituents are too foolish to see it
