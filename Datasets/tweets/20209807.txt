Obama, Pelosi still insist on ramming health care takeover through Congress. This big govt. plan wrong for Florida, wrong for nation.
Dems want to gamble with one-sixth of the U.S. economy with their health care plan. Americans reject it, so do I. Go to crenshaw.house.gov.
Pelosi and Obama want to take over heath care and raise your taxes. Didn't support their plan last fall and will vote against it again.
CBO: Dem health care plan costs $1 tillion, raises taxes, cuts Medicare, hikes insurance. GOP plan provides more access to affordable care.

Listened to the President tonight and what we need is a new bill, not a new speech. The problem isn't the messenger, it's the message.
On health reform, we all share a common goal - make more coverage available to those who cannot otherwise afford it. http://bit.ly/38AMst
District feedback has been very helpful!  Farmers and small biz owners concerned about high cost, loss of choice of Dem health plan.
Problems exist with health care, but change for the sake of change is not necessarily good. Congress needs to take the time to get it right.
Only GOP health care reform gets at heart of crisis by slashing costs with competition and increasing access with choice and transparency.
Republicans propose true health care reform: Allow Americans to choose their own doctor and get the treatment they need when they need it.

Heading to the House Floor now to cast my "NO" vote on the $846 billion energy tax.
The $846 billion energy tax will hurt every American family and increase the cost of everything from electricity to gas and groceries!
Florida stands to lose nearly 100,000 jobs in coming years under Nancy Pelosi’s energy tax plan.  Another reason to vote against the bill.
A national energy tax is the wrong approach to solving America’s energy dilemma. Speaker Pelosi should shelve “cap and trade” legislation.
