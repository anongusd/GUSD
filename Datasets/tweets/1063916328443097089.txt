@IngrahamAngle @kelly_clarkson On the contrary, @FoxNews does not matter. Especially the vial reporting you do, nothing about that matters.
@realDonaldTrump Yes indeed, when facts are discovered it becomes an issue for you, thus, label them the “enemy” rather than what they are: honest unlike you. 	@nytpolitics @nytimes #facts #FactsMatter

@Supt_Hoffman @dougducey The ratio of State Veterans #counselors is even more concerning; number of #Veterans in #AZ = 580,000; number of State Veteran benefit counselors (per AZDVS budget proposal estimate) = 392 | 1,479 to 1 is pretty unfathomable especially when the police to citizen ratio is 555 to 1

@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Are you capable of telling the truth? Being a pathelogical LIAR is one thing but it appears a new condition has emerged “Trumpelogical LIAR” - Defined as: someone who LIES about LIES they said seconds before the first LIE. #TrumpShutdown #TrumpLies #TrumpDerangementSyndrome #lie
@BillOReilly How odd, claiming @KamalaHarris doesn’t believe in due process yet you have a clear misunderstanding of what that is.  Coming from someone who circumvented due process by settling sexual harassment claims prior to those women even having a chance at due process. #IRONY
