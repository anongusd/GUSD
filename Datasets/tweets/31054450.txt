7:01 in the 701. Good to be back for a few hours!
@linsboe there's a movie from it?? I'll see if I can finish reading it first. Was that the book u finished this morning or just started?
@linsboe hahaha I can't remember the last time I read fiction. Bring it to Fargo when you come back.
@linsboe no you're completely right, it wasn't written to be controversial. It's literature and a small piece of a book.
@linsboe I did; it makes it sound like farmers forced GMOs on consumers. Consumer demand for cheap food did that.
@linsboe the paragraph? It's bad. It's against GMOs and conveys the assumption that they're unhealthy when they're really not.
@linsboe did you not get my text message? Lol what book was that from?

Q12: changing from a monoculture (my def.) with the current available technologies in agriculture would be a poor choice. #agchat
Q6: human consumption. HRSW = high protein = high quality baking bread. #agchat
Q5: Low input costs, economically feasible in low soil nutrient areas like SWND, university backed breeding programs #agchat
