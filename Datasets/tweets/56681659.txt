@AmerAcadPeds A2.4: Terminating long standing protections such as DACA and TPS means that recipients and their families, including more than 500,000 U.S. citizen children, are facing a great deal of anxiety and fear each day that passes without a solution. #SaludTues
A2.3: The administration‚Äôs recent ‚Äúzero tolerance policy‚Äù resulted in thousands of families being separated. Children separated from parents are more likely to experience depression and anxiety. According to @AmerAcadPeds family separation can cause irreparable harm. #SaludTues
A2.2: Increased interior enforcement activities such as workplace and home raids lead to parents being detained without warning. This sudden separation can have deep psychological consequences for children and is likely to affect the parent-child attachment. #SaludTues

A6.3: Holding this legal use of benefits against them threatens their economic security and the health and wellbeing of their children. Basically--it targets them. #ProtectFamilies #SaludTues
A6.2: Furtheremore, the majority of children of immigrants live in a household where both parents are working but are employed in lower-paying jobs that don‚Äôt provide enough income for them to meet their families‚Äô needs. #SaludTues
A6.1: Approximately 1 in 4 children (18 million) live in a family with at least one immigrant parent and children of immigrants are the fastest-growing group of American children. #SaludTues https://t.co/H2ERfAFYNA

A3.2: Moreover DHS claims it will not include a child‚Äôs use of SNAP in the public charge rule. But the agency also admits that, due to fear and misinformation, some parents will likely disenroll their children, even if they are eligible. #SaludTues
A3.1: In short, children and families will go hungrier with less access to nutritious food. #SNAP is a pooled household resource‚Äîif even one member loses access to the program, there will be less food available for everyone, including children. #SaludTues https://t.co/tINTPmGLvs

A2.4: Not only would this proposed rule have repercussions for the economic well-being of immigrant families, it will also undermine family unity and stability by making it harder for parents to enter, or remain in, the country with their children. #SaludTues
A2.3: The changes proposed in this rule would have a profound impact on the ability of low-income, immigrant families to meet their basic needs. #SaludTues
A2.2: One of the large group that public charge targets is immigrant parents. Important reminder--there is no way to hurt immigrant parents without also harming their children.
A2.1: This rule would apply to individuals applying for admission to the United States or applying for adjustment of status to that of lawful permanent resident, with the exception of asylees, refugees or those otherwise exempt. #SaludTues https://t.co/FV7J0Qt59F

A9b. Every $5 in new SNAP benefits generates an estimated $9 in economic activity. An increase of $1 billion in SNAP benefits increases GDP by $1.79 billion and results in an increase of 8,900-17,900 full-time equivalent jobs. #FoodFri
A9a. #SNAP is designed to help families put food on the table during economic downturns. In fact, it is a major stimulus for the economy! https://t.co/Gjklj84cwF
A6b. A Farm Bill that increases SNAP benefits for families with children so that they last through the entire of the month, incentivizes healthy food purchases, and makes accessing and staying on the program easier would go a long way. #FoodFri
A6a. #SNAP is an important tool for fighting poverty and food insecurity, but even with its help, low-income families with children still suffer from both of those conditions. #FoodFri https://t.co/b3K1hSByYD
A5b. As the largest food assistance program serving children, SNAP helps protect low-income children from this harm. For more, see https://t.co/WIuqHNSORy #FoodFri
A5a. Unfortunately, 12.5 million (or 1 in 6) children lived in a food insecure household last year. Food insecurity is especially harmful for children: it hurts their health, development, and educational outcomes. #FoodFri https://t.co/N8rDLp9jcW
A1.2: SNAP is so important because it combats poverty and the threat of food insecurity‚Äîwhich is when families have uncertain access to enough healthy food. See our fact sheet here: https://t.co/J5YrFdNLZs #FoodFri
A1. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is the nation‚Äôs largest federal food assistance program. It provides low income families who are struggling to make ends meet with much-needed funds for groceries. #FoodFri https://t.co/VwYCPViteo

Counter to recent threats to critical benefit programs, Members of @CPAG_USA published Our Kids, Our Future, a compendium of over 20 solutions to reduce child poverty in the U.S. https://t.co/gS4ywwNrqk #EndChildPoverty #ValueOurKids
The U.S. Child Poverty Action Group (@CPAG_USA) is a partnership made up of over 20 national organizations who are dedicated to cutting the U.S. child poverty rate in half within a decade: https://t.co/UX0Fs74PHO. #EndChildPoverty #ValueOurKids
This is the wrong direction for our nation‚Äôs children. Instead, we need to build on what works and ensure that every child has the resources they need while their brains are undergoing critical stages of development. #ValueOurKids #EndChildPoverty
Access to critical benefits for immigrant households is threatened by the potential expansion of the public charge rule, which would force millions of families to choose between reuniting with their loved ones and weathering tough times: https://t.co/S4srtJXoOL #ValueOurKids
As these threats result in households with children losing access to these critical programs and make it hard for parents and caregivers to find and maintain work: https://t.co/bU675a4aB8 #EndChildPoverty #ValueOurKids
We must protect these programs from threats such as funding cuts, time limits and employment documentation requirements. #EndChildPoverty #ValueOurKids
In most low-income households w/children, there is at least one family working. Yet due to low wages, skyrocketing rents, the high cost of everyday goods, parents still struggle to make ends meet and turn to key assistance programs to supplement resources for their families.
Research tells us that when a child receives resources at an early age, it not only lifts them out of poverty but creates a long-term positive impact on a child‚Äôs life, regardless of their family‚Äôs socioeconomic status: https://t.co/9aR1QUvUiU #EndChildPoverty #ValueOurKids
Yet the good news is that today‚Äôs @uscensusbureau data also shows us that critical anti-poverty programs such as SNAP and refundable tax credits lifted millions of children out of poverty in 2017. https://t.co/y5Ec8wN6IO  #EndChildPoverty #ValueOurkids
Children in poor families were four times more likely to be in fair or poor health and nine times more likely to experience food insecurity: https://t.co/Ubl7QKy4xo  #EndChildPoverty #ValueOurKids

Children of color especially continue to experience poverty at a higher rate than white children. #EndChildPoverty #ValueOurKids
While this means that 450,000 less children are living in poverty than last year, children continue to experience poverty at the highest rates in our society. #EndChildPoverty #ValueOurKids

@PeebsY0 Agreed! Here is why we think we need an independent Commissioner for Children to look into these matters. ‚Äî&gt; https://t.co/CIkazbcQOC
@ananavarro This, we want to stop the practice of institutions investigating themselves. They fail kids.		Here is our proposal to create an independent Children‚Äôs Commissioner. ‚Äî&gt; https://t.co/CIkazbcQOC		We would love any thoughts you might have on the idea. (6)
@ananavarro And certainly, the abuse of children in the Church included secrecy and cover up over decades. https://t.co/u1ATKNeZJN (5)
@ananavarro The current system of institutions and government investigating themselves is a fiasco. They repeatedly cover up and whitewash the problem and pardon themselves.		Just yesterday, Virginia did it related to migrant children in their detention centers. https://t.co/eZcGFVYBCG (4)
"Arkansas‚Äôs Department of Human Services released numbers on its work requirement late Tuesday and they continue to suggest that the rollout of the new work requirements policy is extremely flawed and that thousands could lose coverage by September 1." https://t.co/GNPbTYVMUv
@ananavarro Thus, we are preparing to call upon Congress to create an independent Commissioner for Children, just as many other countries and some states have.		They could independently investigate and issue reports on issues related to the protection of children. (3) https://t.co/MFW34VV4Gt
@ananavarro For example, the child abuse in the Church has happened over decades, Larry Nassau‚Äôs abuse of young women at Michigan State and USA Gymnastics occurred over two decades, separated families and detention center abuse continues, Kids for Cash in juvenile justice in PA, etc. (2)
@ananavarro Hey @ananavarro, you are awesome on so many issues. How about a bipartisan idea to protect kids? 		Institutions ‚Äî both private and government ‚Äî typically cover up abuse when notified rather than protect children. In some cases, this has happened for decades. (1)
