@LongmontRespnds @America0164 @robbystarbuck @LynnePatton @RashidaTlaib Thank you for the apology. I just wish Twitter could become a nice place.
@LongmontRespnds @America0164 @robbystarbuck @LynnePatton @RashidaTlaib Who and what are you talking about? And why are you being so rude?
@LongmontRespnds @America0164 @robbystarbuck @LynnePatton @RashidaTlaib I disagree with a women being called a prop. I disagree that it proves someone is racist. But I guess we just disagree.
@LongmontRespnds @America0164 @robbystarbuck @LynnePatton @RashidaTlaib Didn’t say that, however to say it makes sense in this case is just disingenuous. She has no idea. Again, it’s just the thing to say. It ends all conversation.
@HuffPost @TezlynFigaro And all of you are doing nothing but judging this woman. You have no idea of her thoughts or https://t.co/pY4gqbu5b1 are no better than whom you are accusing. It is astounding the judgement, intolerance and hatred being spewed forth.  Maybe it’s time for some self reflection.
@LongmontRespnds @America0164 @robbystarbuck @LynnePatton @RashidaTlaib That’s your opinion which means nothing, neither does the opinion of the rep. Disingenuous at best. The go to is to call racism. It really means nothing anymore.
@LongmontRespnds @America0164 @robbystarbuck @LynnePatton @RashidaTlaib No, she really didn’t.
@RepMaxineWaters @realDonaldTrump Is this really how you’re spending your time?
@Ilhan @RepPressley @RepRashida @RepAOC I’m feeling like some of these freshmen reps we’ve elected have little to no understanding of the various functions of governmental agencies. And when they get caught, they try to backtrack, lie and blame someone else!
@ABC And he is adorable! Is there a point other than to express the sweetness of this moment?
@peacetown @plainspoken2015 @shellbum1 @AOC Well, that’s the most reasonable thing to do. When you say they have universal healthcare and it’s not true, what else is there to say?
@plainspoken2015 @shellbum1 @AOC You need to do research regarding their healthcare systems.
@plainspoken2015 @shellbum1 @AOC They aren’t socialist.
@jpo_mpls @TEAMWOODPROTECT @GOP Yes, some are but but I’m not here to argue. Of course we face the same issues, economic etc as all countries face. The point is healthcare is a huge issue, we are an enormous country and changes to the healthcare system needs to be thoughtfully and carefully engineered.
@jpo_mpls @TEAMWOODPROTECT @GOP 2/2 to aging populations, struggling economies, changing demographics etc. The “throw away” all insurance advocated by some candidates is not reflective of the more successful healthcare systems of other countries.
@jpo_mpls @TEAMWOODPROTECT @GOP 1/2 Yes, those are the facts. However, you also need to research the reasons other counties are more successful regarding healthcare. It is usually not due to strictly socialized medicine. Additionally, further research indicates other countries are facing healthcare concerns due
@GovMikeHuckabee Please stop.
@thehonorablecsc @SAskew49 Let’s stop, children.
@eblase15 @EllaSterling16 @RealSaavedra @benshapiro Research, in many of the countries citizens who can afford it buy supplemental insurance to cover what the national system does not cover or to reduce waiting times for procedures. “Everything” is not automatically covered.
@MeghanMcCain @VanJones68 @CNN Thank you to Van and Meghan. So sorry to see the many ugly responses. Perfect examples of why politics are in such an ugly place.
@SenJeffMerkley @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Why don’t ALL of you quit making snarky comments, grow up and start doing your jobs? There’s enough fault for everyone to share. My goodness you people are supposed to be our leaders.
