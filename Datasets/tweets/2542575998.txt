Reduced funding will lead to cuts of Medicaid services that are optional to states, but critical to people with disabilities – such #HCBS.
SourceAmerica opposes proposals that reduces the Nation’s commitment to fund #Medicaid at current levels.
Medicaid provides vital health care services and long-term services and supports to 10 million people with disabilities. #SaveMedicaid
The Senate #HealthcareBill would cut critical employment support for #PWD to live independently in their community.
