My thanks to any who prayed for me. I am feeling much better. Still weak. But not at death's door.
Now I have diminished function of the left arm, and my right arm tingles, and I am unable to talk very well.
At first the pain was only on one side (my left) radiating down to my elbow from my back.
I am pretty short of breath and it is very hard to talk.
I fear I may lose my diaphragm, and then I would of course, lose my lungs. This would mean death.
They just treated me like a criminal and blew me off. Now I think I am having some paralysis to my vocal chords.
I am not on them now, and did not want them. I wanted to know why I was in pain. No one accessed me.
I have been in excruciating pain for two weeks. I visited the ER twice, they treated me like a "med seeker", gave me pain pills.
Also hoarseness and shortness of breath.
But I thought I would tweet my demise. Right now my symptoms are: weakness, numbness and tingling in extremities.
I am not sure what to do about it. I cannot find a Doctor that will take me.
I think I may be dying.

@JonahNRO I believe the Sentinelese People would tell you where you could put the whole "International Community" thing.
@dewbymaster Sorry to be chatty but you can blame my nephew for pushing his Aunt Lolly's "on" button.8)
@dewbymaster Once you have cut anything that does not have the same leaves as the Nandina. Hard prune it below the windows 10 inches.
@dewbymaster It can also be propagated by cutting btw, That is you can take a hard shoot you have pruned, stick in ground, it will root.
@dewbymaster And it could be pruned very nicely to stay below your window lines.
@dewbymaster The color of the brick of your house would be quite striking with the new growth of Nandina in front of it.
@dewbymaster Anything else is an opportunist. Something that flew in on the wind, or bird poop.
@dewbymaster Probably the Nandina is the shrub that is meant to be on this section of your house.
@dewbymaster The pod of the bindweed when it opens sends out hundreds of seeds. This is why I say bag it. They will ripen in the sun.
@dewbymaster Or send it to my nephew @DDKsteve and he will send it to his Aunt Lolly. haha
@dewbymaster If you are close to Marcum's nursery, you can always cut a piece of the plant, take it to them, and they will ID it.
@dewbymaster The leaves usually id the plant. The way they grow, That, and flowering habit if it is a shrub.
@dewbymaster And, in Oklahoma you need good sturdy drought tolerant plants. This is one of those.
@dewbymaster The new leaves are red usually, or reddish and if you prune harshly in fall, then you have this nice red glow against brick.
@dewbymaster Nandina is actually quite lovely when pruned down. It gets very bushy. The flowers attract many early butterflies.
@dewbymaster The flowers are like long grape clusters, usually white. It provides winter berries for birds.
@dewbymaster It is very sturdy. It can be cut to the ground and it will return. It can be harshly pruned.
@dewbymaster Behind this plant are the leaves of a shrub called Nandina, btw. http://t.co/iU4FEeshHe
@dewbymaster When I say bag the pods, I mean do not compost. Bag it with bagged trash so the pods do not open in the sun. They will ripen.
@dewbymaster It will choke a shrub to death.If you can follow the sturdy stem to the ground, yank it  by its roots. http://t.co/lQGAnKW8rv
@dewbymaster This is bindweed. It must be eradicated. Pull it by its roots. bag the pods and trash them.
@dewbymaster If the shrub is grown for foliage then generally pruning only helps.
@dewbymaster Careful pruning is usually reserved for fruit trees and shrubs that flower profusely.
@dewbymaster If you can get pictures of the leaves or flowers, this would help in identifying the species.
@dewbymaster This happens a lot, especially with old shrubs. And there are always opportunists, birds eat berries. Bird poop has seeds.,
@dewbymaster In the fall, you can prune more harshly. In fact, many shrubs do better the following year following a fall pruning.
@dewbymaster From the photo, it looks like you have more than one species.
@dewbymaster If you are concerned about losing the shrub, cut to old wood. Do not prune harshly. Cut only this year's growth.
@dewbymaster Most shrubs do not suffer from pruning. a close up of some of the leaves would help in identification however.

Might also have the added effect of reducing divorce rate since the waiting list to get a judge to marry you would no doubt be years.
Then "civil union" would finally be settled and churches could have their sacrament of marriage.
Or any other civil/justice of the peace who has a license with the state to join you legally.
They could then say individually, sure I will marry you, but it will not be legal, you must see a judge for that.
We could settle gay marriage issue tomorrow if all clergy would just not renew license to do civil ceremonies.

@MarkWBennett You are in the news again.
As a private business owner you cannot then make your business a "gun free zone". You are discriminating against gun owners.
If you say: You cannot refuse service to me because I am gay, then you must also say: You cannot refuse service to me because I have a gun.
If a private business owner does not wish to do business with me because he hates red heads, I am ok with that.
For ANY reason in a private business you can discriminate. This does not mean that if you do, I have to do business with you.
As a libertarian I do not believe you have the right to force anyone to serve you. For any reason. Yes, you can discriminate.
@andersoncooper Private Business: We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone. Kind of like your home. get it?
Does @andersoncooper now have a degree in theology?
@andersoncooper So a "preemptive" bill that protects gay rights would also be questionable?
@andersoncooper Your reasoning in questioning implies you oppose a "preemptive" bill protecting religious freedom.
@andersoncooper So, by your questioning you would also oppose a bill protecting gay rights, since no discrimination cases have been filed?
I am sad that I am not young enough to be a knucklehead.

@wilw I would love to see you retweet what you believe to be "unhinged" on #tcot
@wilw Being a role model for hatred and contempt of others because they think or speak differently than you. Great job there, Wil.
@wilw Is it really necessary to call entire groups of people "unhinged", and also show your "southern folk" phobia?

Indignant Self-aggrandizement is not an answer to a question @SenFeinstein You came off looking like a cranky old woman.
Hint to Liberals: I am perfectly capable of discerning my own NEEDS, thanks.
Why do liberals like @kirstenpowers10 believe it is up to them and Government to decide what I NEED.

Boom Fast and Furious. #debate
But, that is what you did, Mr. President. You lied for 2 weeks. #debate
No, actually, Obama, when "folks" mess with Americans, our president goes to the UN and apologizes for American's bad behavior. #debate

@ThrekStari @GuildWars2 Guilds are notoriously buggered all around. They are working on them, and improvements are happening daily.
@Maico_Timmerman @GuildWars2 I works intermittently. Sometimes completely logging out or in works, or going to a new zone.
@aNibelung @GuildWars2 I would choose botting. and let them figure it out.
@GuildWars2 I seem to be the only one in my guild that cannot send mail. You really do hate me. Is it because I gave you $200?
@gondorle @guildwars2 Well you are in the queue. Know that your account is safe! They will get to you!!
@gondorle @GuildWars2 Would be nice if they would give some time frame. At my favorite restaurant I have waited over an hour!
@gondorle @GuildWars2 You did go make a ticket, right, at the support site so you are in the queue? They are going through them!
@chongming_nana @GuildWars2 They will be up and down intermittently while they test them.
@wowqwop @GuildWars2 There is a very long queue on responses. Give it a little while. Did you open a ticket at http://t.co/odxo51xu
@aNibelung @GuildWars2 You can report them via their name in chat by clicking on it, or by taking down their name and doing a /report.
@Zosimose @GuildWars2 Are you running it as admin?
@The_fat_0ne @GuildWars2 Everything was completely intact, all characters, bank was ok, all was well. Hope they get to you soon.
@The_fat_0ne @GuildWars2 I hope you get on soon. My account was restored and it seems they have speeded up the processing time.
@GuildWars2 I just got my account back. Thank you for tolerating my rants. My guildmates suffering is over as well.
@GuildWars2 Sigh. why do you hate us so.
@StephenEmert @GuildWars2 The support staff is a monkey hermetically sealed in a balloon in space who only speaks every 5 days.
@Mark_Jonie @GuildWars2 No, they are in a meeting, and there were donuts. 4 days to 11 days is their current turn around.
@chadneal @GuildWars2 This is just unacceptable.
@MerkMerkum @GuildWars2 Mine is 11 days I think they are not moving mine along on purpose because I have been very LOUD about the issue.
@The_fat_0ne @GuildWars2 My ticket is 11 days old. good luck.

@Grade247 @GuildWars2 Correct. 4 or 5 days or up to 11 as is my open ticket.
@GuildWars2 I have been online since 1993 and never been hacked. You accomplished it in SEVEN DAYS. congrats.
@GuildWars2 And BOOM you reply to a gold seller post but NOT to people who have paid but lost access to their accounts. Good job there, Anet
@jacobstreeter @GuildWars2 You can report them in game by clicking their name and choose report or by using /report.
@Ingen175 @GuildWars2 The current turnaround is 11 days and counting.
@GuildWars2 @nievesj I doubt it. My ticket is 11 days old. Who do you have working on it, one guy?
@lowwalker @GuildWars2 I am also guild leader, I am on skype with my guild right now, who are in playing the game. My ticket is 11 days old.
@Vireni @niblic3rd @GuildWars2 My ticket is 11 days old and counting. Pull up a chair.

@GuildWars2 How badly we have been treated in a nutshell. http://t.co/FajX393f
@GuildWars2 Your support queue is over ELEVEN days LONG.
@GuildWars2 FIFTEEN HOURS without an update on FB and THOUSANDS of accounts hacked or compromised and more by the hour. ARE YOU KIDDING?
@GuildWars2 This is so unacceptable. What HORRIBLE customer service.
@GuildWars2 What is interesting is that my account was secure in Guild Wars 1 for 7 years. In GW2....one week.
@GuildWars2 Here is my prize Support ticket! TEN DAYS OLD and still open 120821-005191 I should sell it on ebay.
@Rocman1617 @GuildWars2 Well I felt so badly for ya. We can suffer together.
@Rocman1617 @GuildWars2 My guildmates have been watching my log in's closely. No one has logged into my account that they have seen.
@Rocman1617 @GuildWars2 I am a bigger fool than you though! I spent 150 on the CE and 50 in game on gems before I was denied service.
@Rocman1617 @GuildWars2 My bet is you created your account here on twitter, just due to the lack of response from actual "support" *cough*
@Rocman1617 @GuildWars2 I did post your twitter page to the FB page, because your case was so classically what thousands are doing. sad.
@Rocman1617 @GuildWars2 They stopped sales last night. I would not purchase a thing from this company again, IMHO
@Rocman1617 @GuildWars2 At the rate they are going I do not see any of us getting our account back for months.
@GuildWars2 Should have named the game: "Guild Killer"
@Rocman1617 @GuildWars2 Yea, I already have told my guild (I am guild leader) that I probably will not be coming back. I am soured on gw2.
@Rocman1617 @GuildWars2 I do not think Support is moving...at all. I have one ticket that is 10 days old.
@GuildWars2 You should kind of expect that. I have a ticket that is 10 days old now. You are seriously backed up. HIRE SOME PEOPLE.
@Rocman1617 @GuildWars2 Yea it is not looking good. Essentially my "head start" has now been erased.
@Patrick_feeley @GuildWars2 There are thousands with you. It has been 24 hours for me, 4 days for some.
@etork0925 @GuildWars2 The confirm sometimes goes away very quickly have you hovered over it very carefully?
@raylcc @GuildWars2 Go to the guild wars support page and click ask a question. You can enter a ticket without logging in your account
@franekpl @GuildWars2 The longest I have seen is 7 and counting.
@gondorle @GuildWars2 Go to the support page and enter a ticket. (use the ask a question feature) it does not require log in.
@Azofer0540 @GuildWars2 I have been in the same pool for 24 hours. The longest I have seen is since last Saturday.
@WillDoi @GuildWars2 They indicated once that they would not remove them til they had the log in issues resolved.
@Sabouma1979 @GuildWars2 Welcome to the fray. Thousands are in the same boat. Go to the support page and enter a ticket.
@evilshadowx @GuildWars2 Pick another and try a transfer. They are banning people every day. You could get lucky.
@GuildWars2  I only wish to change my password and be gone.
@GuildWars2 In good news, Guild Wars 2 may have cured my pc game addiction. I have no desire to play another.
@alveron @GuildWars2 I have been waiting 24 hours, some people have been waiting 4 days.
@GuildWars2 Any ETA on when you will fix this Denial of Service attack?

@GuildWars2 http://t.co/gPW2iUuX
@GuildWars2 @Daniel_Grigs I have been waiting 24 hours now. There are hundreds in front of me and behind me. You have now stepped in line.
@GuildWars2 Could you please check on the status of [Incident: 120830-008552] It has been 24 hours since I was locked out of my account.
@GuildWars2 Good night Guild Wars, thanks for listening to me vent all day. Hope this is not Goodbye forever. 8 years is a long time.
@GuildWars2 But no update on when honorable accounts that are "banned for their own protection" will be able to log in. I feel so...special.
Anyone  getting email from me  that is coming from Nalora Burns @GuildWars2 (a game) was hacked today. What a nightmare.
@GuildWars2 My guild mates (all of them able to log in) have access to Black Lion, but their Guild Leader (me) is locked out of GW. 8(
@GuildWars2 Sadness increases. My guild mates have access to Black Lion now and are buying other people's cookies.
@nievesj @SkepticalSquirr @GuildWars2 Me either, never played WOW. Only GW and COH.
@GuildWars2 All this because YOU made me change my account from my secure one to ANOTHER one on launch day.
@GuildWars2 @dswayze3 And my guild mates a day of watching my account for suspicious activity.
@GuildWars2 @dswayze3 Wow, if I had that confirmed that easily, would have saved me a day of worry.
@GuildWars2 What a foolish old woman I am. But! Taught me a lesson, I will never every pre purchase again...ever.
@GuildWars2 Only to be locked out when the game was "live" (although in honesty, it is still in Beta, you are just making us pay for it)
@GuildWars2 Also foolish. A fool and his money are soon parted on paying 150 bucks to play a beta.
@GuildWars2 As the hours drag by, and I still cannot log in, I am more and more sorry for paying 150 dollars for the Collectors Edition.
@dswayze3 @GuildWars2 Yes. I have been locked out of mine for 14 hours.
@GuildWars2 So, no news for those of us with error 11:0:2:1708 still. sigh.
@GuildWars2  Are we able to get a refund for gem purchases if we are unable to log in and decide to get a refund on the game?
@GuildWars2 Any love I had for this game has been sapped out by this week long fiasco. I am left with only sadness for the waste.
@GuildWars2 WHEN are you going to allow the people who you allowed to be hacked get back in game??????
@GuildWars2 Should never have used an email address log in. My log in to gw1 was safe for 7 years because it was an @ncsoft.com address
@GuildWars2 I got the email from support to give them my email, reg code etc. Now waiting on what to do next.
@endakinahan @GuildWars2 But, I never recieved any kind of mail that my password was reset. So, who knows.
@endakinahan So I have been trying to change my email from my "web mail" account to my secure since last thursday.
@endakinahan @GuildWars2 It was "in use" because it was in use BY Guild wars 2. I have the entire support thread saved.
@endakinahan @GuildWars2 Since then I have an open support ticket trying to change it to my secure one, but it says it is "in use".
@endakinahan @GuildWars2 Then last thursday they asked for another, and I used a webmail (which I consider not secure)
@endakinahan @GuildWars2 You are probably right. The issue with mine is that when I originally gave them my email in April it was my secure.
@GuildWars2 Sigh. this makes me so sad. Why did you not have a real beta instead of this "paid for it" Beta?
@as311 @GuildWars2 I tried putting in my serial code again, still says my password is invalid.
@GuildWars2 Man I hate spending 150 dollars on crap that is this screwed up.
@GuildWars2 I am also my Guild's Leader. They are watching my account to see if anyone else logs into it. I am on skype with them.
@as311 @GuildWars2 I am in the same boat with you. I was actually booted off while playing this morning saying my password was invalid.
@as311 @GuildWars2 This is the same error code I am getting.
@Brianschreffler @Guildwars2 No post in 8 hours on their FB, and minimal replies here on twitter. They did post on reddit.
@Brianschreffler I am unable to log in. I do not know why. @Guildwars2 does not wish to comment. Hundreds of people are now reporting same.
@SkepticalSquirr @nievesj @GuildWars2 I do not use blizzard or sony. My password is unique to guild wars.
@tombotg @GuildWars2 There are hundreds now, and it is cascading. Very sad.
@endakinahan @GuildWars2 I never use mods or addons.
@GuildWars2 Looking very bad now. Hundreds by the hour not able to log in and having their emails changed. You are hacked big time.
@endakinahan @GuildWars2 I do not buy gold. I have friends watching my account to see if anyone logs into it.
@grailbh @nievesj @GuildWars2 Even more people every hour are losing access to their accounts. This is not looking good at all.
@GuildWars2 Well you have successfully broken up our Guild. We are all going to lay the game down a week til you get it fixed.
@grailbh @nievesj @GuildWars2 Same. I can only believe they are horribly compromised in some way. I cannot even get into support now.
@GuildWars2 Did that, probably about 100 times. Also now unable to log into support/web site. You people are definitely hacked.
@GuildWars2 @Nalora A lot of gamer people are reporting there can be no other reason for so many people to not be able to log in.
@nievesj @GuildWars2 And my password is very strong. I will make it even stronger, I tried to, but that feature is disabled.
@nievesj @GuildWars2 I never click on any emails. I have not recieved any emails. I was IN THE GAME when I was force log out: invalid pass
So @GuildWars2 log in servers are compromised. Thanks, Anet.
Sites are reporting that @GuildWars2 userbase has been hacked and all passwords are stolen.
@GuildWars2 Was your user base hacked as most suspect?
@GuildWars2 Why would I suddenly not be able to log in? Error 11:0:2:1708 Would like some kind of answer.
@GuildWars2 What exactly does Gaile the "community director" do, anyway? Lot of money wasted on people who do not communicate.
@GuildWars2 5 HOURS ago on FACEBOOK someone communicated with us. My bet is your servers got hacked.
@GuildWars2 I was able to log in from the first BWE til today, Now I am unable to log in.
@GuildWars2 What horrible communication you have. Post stuff on your OFFICIAL page. reddit? Twitter? Facebook? round and round and round....
@NCsoft_Support I am going insane trying to get an answer from Guild Wars 2 on a support ticket. sigh.
@GuildWars2 Crickets. tap tap tap Is this thing on?
@GuildWars2 I only have ONE account, but you are now sending bulk mail to both emails since you forced me to change it yesterday.
@GuildWars2 The still unresolved incident report on this is: 120821-005191
@GuildWars2 Ok, now I know my account is screwy from yesterday's "renew email" fiasco. Just got email from you guys on BOTH accounts.

By the way, folks, Hobby Lobby is also a Christian based company.

Here is a suggestion for all you "tolerant liberals" Eat your rainbow Oreos at Chick-Fil-A.
The real culprit in all of the mass shootings of the last 20 years is the dismantling of our mental health system.
America: The only place where when a madman commits mass murder, a conversation is started to disarm the citizenry.
Personally I am so saddened by the whole thing I am going to go pray for folks in Colorado.
One armed person in the audience and James Holmes would be in the morgue and not "in custody".
And after blaming the Tea Party Liberal HACK @BrianRoss is off and running on his "ban all guns" angle. How...typical.
Will @BrianRoss tweet that the theatre was a "no gun zone" So any CRIMINAL would know everyone else was unarmed? I did not think so.
@DLoesch One reason why we usually have THREE names when there is a suspect in custody, and not just first and last.
@GStephanopoulos You jackass. Can you try to be a reporter first and a political hack later AT LEAST when dead people are involved.
RT @Wittorical: In 4 minutes we'll have learned more about James Holmes then the man running the White House.
Basically it was a bad idea to make any long term plans for guilds in @GuildWars2 with regards to servers, since they are in constant flux.
Yet again we see that the liberals can get sidetracked from big issues by something that never happened except in their minds.
So when are the liberals going to get all bent out of shape and read too much into the term "yall" which is southern for "you people"?
@GuildWars2 I notice that my server that I have used from BWE1 no longer exists. Does this mean my character has already been wiped?
So today's Democrat Distraction is the phrase "you people" REALLY? That all YOU PEOPLE got?

Everyone born in the US is now an INDENTURED SERVANT. You owe the US Governement a TRIBUTE the moment you take breath.
Your new born children are born criminals in the eyes of the US Government if they do not have INSURANCE.

So, scratch all those "Obama has never raised Taxes" lies. Mandate is a TAX
People who want medicare for all do not know there are co-pays that are more than insurance companies co-pays.
People who want medicare for all, do not know they have to pay for medicare, just like insurance.
People who want medicare for all, have never been on medicare and tried to find a doctor that TAKES medicare.
If the individual mandate is not struck down I say we pass a law that everyone must eat one hot dog a week.
If the individual mandate is not struck down I say we pass a law that everyone must buy butter.
If the individual mandate is not struck down I saw we pass a law that everyone must own a gun and take a gun safety course.
If the individual Mandate is not struck down, I say we pass a law that everyone must eat one cow a year.

Hey @theblaze DHS profiles people wearing hoodies. http://t.co/IDtyH0h1
Uh oh, DHS profiled people in Hoodies. http://t.co/IDtyH0h1
One wonders if the left and the Television Media would be satisfied if Zimmerman were publicly guillotined?
Quick! Invest in Orville Redenbacher! http://t.co/Kr4qn0zu
@DLoesch @KeithOlbermann Was he silenced for his speech? I thought he was just fired because he sucked in the ratings.
Which says a lot about the importance of trending on twitter.
Interesting to me is that they would trend on Twitter but not have anyone watch them on Current TV.
Apparently Keith Olbermann and Eliot Spitzer are trending.
@undeadninjas oops. I suck at this twitter thing.
The Dream of America: What "the unifying" Obama could not accomplish, is accomplished by a 9-0 opinion overturning Obamacare.
@writefromkaren 8 years of medical school wasted. All a doctor needs is a video camera and a degree from Columbia School of Broadcasting.
Also any treatment of injuries will be based on these diagnoses.
In the future, all diagnosis of injury will be done by untrained media personnel from grainy video footage.
Happy to see that our Expert Media can detect the absence of blood and bruises from a grainy video taken AFTER Zimmerman had medical care.

Someone explain to this jackass on Hannity that Social Security TAX is not commerce.
Someone explain to this guy on Hannity that conscription into military service is NOT commerce. Thank you, drive thru.
@ianbeyer I was amused that Justice Ginsberg could not understand why someone who was eligible for medicaid would CHOOSE not to apply.
I nominate @HoiDoiter (Victoria Jackson) to play Hanoi Jane Fonda in any movie on Fonda's life.
Dear SCOTUS, not everyone who gets sick decides to go to the Doctor.
Even people who have not chosen to have automobiles should buy gasoline so my food bill goes down.
I want people forced to buy gasoline so my food bill will go down.
Someone please explain to SCOTUS that the cost of gasoline is causing my food bill to go up, and I demand that this be offset in some way.
I shall petition the government to have vegetarians buy meat, since their lack of buying meat makes the cost of my meat go up.

Obama giving a speech in Oklahoma about Energy Production, about as useful as going to Cattlemen's and telling them how to cook steak.
Maybe when he is up in his Helicopter flying from Tinker to Cushing, Oklahoma he might take a look at the landscape.
If the President mentions the flat earthers in his speech in Oklahoma today, there might be a tad bit of Irony there.
So it is ok to call women anything you like as long as you put /jk behind it, or don a clown nose.

It is NOT about the Momon thing. It is about the PRO LIFE thing. @ricksantorum is a living breathing example of Pro-Life. Mitt? Not so much.
Dear Media, Might help if you talked TO southern folk instead of talking ABOUT us from your offices up in New York.
Can we stop calling @BillMaher a comedian and call him what he is: A political commentator.
Everytime I hear a liberal begin a sentence with "I think we can both agree...." I want to scream NO! No, we can't.
Why is a vaginal probe more invasive than cutting, scraping and vacuuming out a baby growing in the womb?
I think the liberals are delighting in the fact that they now have a new word: "Trans-vaginal".
If the GOP nominee is not "perfect" in November I am closing my eyes and pretending it says "NOT OBAMA" next to my check mark.

RIP Beloved @AndrewBreitbart. Because of your fearlessness, many timid and silent voices gained courage to finally speak up.
My Champion @AndrewBreitbart is dead. I am at a loss for words.

Hey @AndrewBreitbart Let's encourage the OccupyWallStreet crowd to stage a massive "sit in" or "bed in" and stay home in Nov. 2012.
The real question @andrewbreitbart is: In two years, will the media be talking about the political force of the OccupyWallStreet folks? Nah.
Fascinating that the world has turned upside down enough that Democrat Candidate for President highest achievements are killing two people.
@AndrewBreitbart I applaud your decision, Andrew, and it is time, and a good decision to stop RTing the rabid hate aimed at you, especially.

And next week! MSNBC continues to push Huntsman as the GOP candidate of choice!
Romney will bring the Big Book of Used Up campaign slogans and platitudes. #cnnteaparty
I am sorry but saying if we removed military, Terrorism would end is like saying if you put women in burkas, rape will end. #cnnTeaparty
@MintCool Promises, promises.
Huntsman gives a mini-stump speech. #cnnTeaParty
The motive, Ron Paul, is that they have a JIHAD.
@scrowder And when the bases leave, the economies of those towns die.
@rickklein Ugh.
Someone tell Romney about Obama suing Arizona for trying to enforce immigration laws, I think he is tardy to that party. #CnnTeaparty
Zzzzz Huntsman. #cnnTeaparty
@LisaDeP Santorum IS the salad bowl I wrapped and put back in the frig. Last week.
@rickklein My empathetic heart did go: "ick, applause? really?" But the libertarian in me bit my tongue.
@rickklein To some people, I guess it is. Kind of like a crucifix in urine is art to some people.
@rickklein Do I find it distasteful and abhorrent? Yes. Do they have the right to do it? Yes.
@rickklein Yes, Rick, in a real world there are people that would cheer that. Ever read Charles Dickens?
RT @AnnCoulter: Does Wolf's contract require him not to know what was said at the last debate?  We've heard all this before!
Open up the war chests! Its a GOP THROW DOWN!
Could someone poke Wolf with a big pointy stick and tell him to get off his tangent.
RT @AnnCoulter: Ron Paul lulled to sleep by Newts stomach growling.
Wolf Blitzer has a personal crusade against Rick Perry at this point. #cnnDebate #cnnteaparty
@Randletr There's a light......over at the Frankenstein place....
@savethiscountry I was wondering if I had time to make coffee while Huntsman answered.
Someone get Wolf a striped shirt and a whiste. He is just itching for anyone to attack Rick Perry. #cnnteaparty
The "Top Tier Romney" steps stupidly into the Media Cage fight trap.
Blech Romney breaks out the Big Book of Campaign slogans and serves up a BIG serving. With gravy. Lumpy Gravy. #cnnteaparty
Everytime I see Huntsman I expect him to break out in a chorus of "Dammit Janet" from Rocky Horror Picture Show.
Someone inform Huntsman that red power ties are so last cycle.
Blech. Huntsman. Mr. Shinola.
I just have to say my timeline on twitter is hilarious. #teaparty people are so funny.
RT @pir8gold: i love you Michelle Bachmann, but when you talk & i close my eyes, i can hear ROCKET J SQUIRREL #tcot
@scrowder Hey! Lay off the tie! (look at the socks!)
Hey Romney, how about cutting wasteful spending FIRST you blowhole. #cnnteaparty
Someone from the Tea Party needs to paraphrase any answer given by Santorum for Wolf. #cnnteaparty
RT @scrowder: Wolf "Lowest Score on Celebrity Jeopardy EVER" Blitzer shouldn't be paraphrasing anything for anybody. #CNNTeaParty
Ugh please Santorum, Don't tell old campaign veteran stories. Its like hearing Aunt Maddie talk about her gall bladder surgery.
Newt. The master of the soundbyte.
Ugh. Huntsman. Mr. Milquetoast.
Woot Point Cain.
CNN should have just put Romney and Perry in a Cage match.
Romney trying to act "forceful" coming off as jackassity. #cnndebate
Dear Romney, It HAS been forced on us for 70 years.
So do we get to move away from the "scare the old folks" questions anytime tonight, ya think? #cnnDebate
Everyone is "on the system" Bachmann, Its a PONZI scheme. Only its MANDATORY.
@DLoesch And Newt can advertise Viagra.
Dear Romney, the word "crisis" is trademark Obama Campaign 2007.
Oh God, Huntsman. The Liberal choice for the GOP candidate.
@AlohaDevil In Florida's humidity, she might need more Aquanet.
Ok, the walk in is like some sort of bizarre fusion of toddlers and tiaras with Mrs. America.
Hey! Did the Koch Brothers pay to fly all those tea party people in for that debate?
Ugh what is this piece of crap glossy ad like "nickname" introduction on @CNN #teaparty debate. Ick.
Hey Hey HO HO, the GOP has got to go? Is that all they got?
Well that was nice timing from the liberals protesting free speech in back of Dana Loesch.
Did this woman on CNN really just say "Charges brought against Perry" as if disparaging social security is somehow illegal?
So, if the bill does not pass, and then Pingponghead uses it as campaign fodder are we allowed to THEN say the whole thing was political?
I wonder if @CNN will be using the term "teabagger" tonight on their debate? Oh wait, @Andersoncooper is not hosting it, is he?
Huntsman: the "Alan" doll as a counter to Romney's Ken.
So, Obama's solution to jobs is....wait for it....another speech! Well at least the teleprompter is still employed, right?
Ok, @thepioneerwoman show has one flaw. It is too dang short. I want an hour!
Since I have never farted on August 26, 2011 before I would like to report that I just had a "historic" fart. That fart is, indeed, history.
Dear @BarackObama You have now used up your quota of the word "Historic" please get out your thesaurus and come up with something else.
Ok, @BarackObama the whole "country before party" line is now overused. Please reach into your bag of idioms and pull out another.
Is @piersmorgan still whining over Christine O'Donnell? *grabs remote, click* what else is on?
Wow so @seanhannity is just now noticing the Southern Bigotry that has been going on at @msnbc for years?
Brink Brink Brinksmanship On the table On the table All options on the Table. Brink Brink Brinksmanship Squawwwwwwk.
Dear @BarackObama You have now hit your limit for the use of the word Brinksmanship. You are bordering on a myna. Break out your thesaurus.
Listening to my two favorite people on Livestream: @AndrewBreitbart and @DLoesch
Thank you @Bret_Baier for asking my question tonight during the debate.
One of the things wrong with our politics in the US is you,@BarackObama. We plan on fixing that in 2012. Or you could fix it now, resign.
So typical of @BarackObama to try to use deaths of our brave men in uniform to up his poll numbers. The man is a weasel.
@bret_baier Could you ask Michelle Bachmann to clear up any of the rumors about her and Sarah Palin?
So Wisconsin stayed the course, even though they did vote in two more Democrats who can now run away rather than do their jobs.
So the Dems are putting that jackass and Viet Nam traitor Sen. Kerry on the "Super Committee". ugh.
I think he is waiting for the DOW to hit -500 before he appears. @AndrewBreitbart
Attention: Pingponghead will address the little people. Bets may be placed now on who gets blamed first.
31 Brave Soldiers die. No statement from the White House. Guess he is too busy with his golf game.
Ok, @JohnKerry, Exactly how does less than 1/2 of 1/3 of the US Government in power less than 6 months cause ANYTHING? You Jackass.
I would ask how far Fareed Zakaria's head is up Obama's ass, but forgot it is up his own so far already.
@River_City Hey there!
Don't ya wish now they would have passed "Cut Cap and Balance"? Thanks Harry Reid hope you enjoy your pomegranates.
Wow, @CNN reporting insiders say WH are badmouthing S&P. Don't you wish you were a fly on the wall right now? Will dead fish be involved?
I think @AndersonCooper "Mr LemmeseehowmanyteabaggingreferencesIcanmakeinonesegment" almost cried there for a moment.
Well, this time @BarackObama has a REAL "historical" moment on his resume. Not too sure he wants to brag about it though...
Anyone else think Geithner questioning S&P calculations a bit absurd?
Dear @JohnKerry Psst. That 84% Congressional Disapproval rating INCLUDES you, you jackass.
Big boom. Power out on southside. John checked og&e and 6000 without power.
RICH MAN, POOR MAN http://t.co/Mxm3zDZ Bill Whittle. I am Poor. But because I am American, I am rich.

I am the Tea Party. If you believe what is said about the Tea Party, then you must believe those things about me.
@lovelytrinkets Led Zeppelin.
Since @BarackObama is the bumper sticker President, I propose "Make Government Bigger!" and "Honk if you Hate Rich People" for 2012
@andylevy Not to be outdone, The Senate Democrats are now planning on dragging in Senator Ted Kennedy for their vote.
@DLoesch On the same day Giffords casts the deciding vote in the House, Biden calls Tea party  "terrorists." What America am I living in?
Pelosi says she is proud to call Giffords her colleague. She is just as proud to call Republicans Terrorists.
While Rep. Giffords casts the deciding vote, the Republicans are called Terrorists.
Just so ya know, my family founded this country.
In the two years @BarackObama has been president I have been told I am a mob, racist, islamophobic, extremist, and now I am a terrorist.
@DLoesch I think it is crap on wheels.
Maybe @BarackObama should tack on paying for millions of pitchforks and torches  so we can go after those mean rich folk's money.
@JoleneAL I see you on FB everyday, silly. Love ya Jo.
Dear @SenJohnMcCain Well, we now know why Sting glows BLUE when you are around.
Dear @Whitehouse Maybe you can get the person who types in all the words in the teleprompter to type up some words on paper called a PLAN.
Dear @Senate_GOPs If I had a "ceiling" Like the "debt ceiling" I would be sleeping under the sky.
Dear @jameslankford We did not vote you into office to compromise the founding principles. Get this house in order. We are praying for you.
Hey @JakeTapper Why not just ask ONE Democrat what they have against a balanced budget?
Guess the @whitehouse does not realize that PRINCIPLES are TRUTHS and should not be #compromised
@jaketapper Good, since the rest of us lost the ability to borrow around the time of TARP.
All us Tea Party Hobbits now know why Sting glows blue when John McCain is around.
@River_City Oh, I come to twitter when I want to scream something from the rooftops. Not often actually. I am lately stunned into silence.
@MSNBC Should just change its name to "The About Fox News" channel.
BTW There is no Debt Ceiling. It is actually a tent flap.
Ok @BobBeckel on The Five reminds me of John Van Horn in Tootsie. WTH is he reading off camera?
Obama is going to have to have a LOT of twitter town halls to get enough gullible teenagers to register to vote for him.
If you want to see the rabid DEMONIC hatred of the Left, you only need to watch @AndrewBreitbart 's retweets.

In fact, I am kind of praying for it to happen. I will provide the popcorn.
All it would take at this point to send the media into a feeding frenzy is for @TeamBachmann to appear ONCE with @SarahPalinUSA

Ugh, I cannot stand another 4 years of MetronomeObama. Someone needs to send him to teleprompter rehab.
In fact, @glennbeck spent a whole 3 hours today talking about the "non-story" of Obama's birth certificate and mocking those making a fuss.
So, the media is spending a lot of time on the "non-story" of Obama's Birth Certificate.

Dear @ladygaga Do something really original, piss off the muslims. Outraging Christians is so passe'.

@andrewbreitbart And you did great. But the segment was too short!
You are still my hero @AndrewBreitbart Here is a little manna from heaven from me. Thanks for staying in the fight! You give me hope.
Dear @JacksonJrOnline Please get a dictionary and look up the word: Servitude.
So @JacksonJrOnline is in favor of slavery. If healthcare service is a RIGHT then you must enslave others to provide that SERVICE.
Healthcare: NOT a "right" would mean healthcare providers would be slaves. Education: NOT a "right" requires teachers to be slaves to teach.
Someone needs to inform the left that NOTHING can be a "right" if it requires that another human being is enslaved to provide a service.

So I am guessing that Obama is back on the "speech and appear everywhere on the tv" kick he was on the first year.
Mara Liason is basically saying that Obama is leading like a cat who falls off the television set, then says: I meant to do that.
Not defunding simple things like Planned Parenthood and NPR is like saying your household budget must include dining out every night.
@jamhess This whole thing is beginning to remind me of that I Love Lucy episode where Ricky puts her on a budget.
The annual nose picking contest in South Bend Indiana will be cancelled if the government shuts down.
Anthony Weiner now blames the GOP for Little League Baseball being cancelled if the Govt. shuts down. WTF.
There is a lot of talk about people dying from the Democrats while they make sure that babies die, and do not pay Military who may die.
@kfor It is God's turn to do the watering at my house.
Now Democrats say the Republicans are women and children killers. Add that one to the list of "tried and failed" attacks from the left.
@KFOR Woke up to the tempting SMELL of rain. Alas, it is just nature mocking me.
@FreeWeThePeople I am good. I come on every so often, but life gets busy. How are you?

From now on when Obama uses some "Average Joe" person in one of his speeches, I am replacing it with Bilbo Baggins, since both are fiction.
Liberals have now added "Republicans will stop the cure to cancer" to their Scare the old folks and poor people will starve repertoire.
Dear @Johnboehner Remember November. Don't back down. Cut Cut Cut.
My guess is Obama will use as much free TV time he can get now that he is in full campaign mode.
Pingponghead is on my TV talking again, with the same old "liberal sob stories". Pass me a hankie, Marge.
I see @glennbeck is pulling a "Seinfeld" exit from his show. Great timing. Television is a dying medium.
IMHO a Government shut down is a positive thing and we should be looking to who gets the CREDIT for it, not whose to blame.
Democrats already pulling out the "scare the old folks" and "poor folk suffering" arguments and we are only a week into this election cycle.
You would think if we knew that Dole suffered from Erectile Disfunction, we could find out why Obama has a big scar on the back of his head.
Dear @realDonaldTrump Could you find out what that big scar across the back of Obama's head came from?
@FingersMalloy Dare you to name Oklahoma's NFL or Pro Baseball team!
@FingersMalloy Because they live in Oklahoma?
#Obama2012Slogans WTF! Let's Move! To France.
Well, that is certainly who I look for in a candidate. Someone who I disagree with.
From what I can see in Obama's new re-election video, he is saying he is supported by people who do not agree with him.
Dear @SenatorReid You do not know anything about the Tea Party, so quit giving wordy evidence to your ignorance.
Thank you @Guildwars for the awesome April Fools. Very fun!
Every single wind/thunder storm causes that one limb to move the powerlines, but it is sacred to @OGandE I guess.
Meanwhile the @OGandE guys are cutting my neighbor's tree in the MIDDLE of her yard that has no limbs even close to power lines.
Hmm, @OGandE guys are cutting the trees today. Yet again they "no can do" when asked to cut the one limb causing my brown outs.
I wonder how well it would go over if the @USArmy told men to wear scarves instead of helmets in a war zone?
Dear @USArmy The Hijab is not Army Regulation for military dress. Please stop telling women in Afghanistan to wear them.
Wonder what would happen if all state legislatures just made it a requirement to show your birth certificate to get on the ballot?
Dear @realDonaldTrump You are right about China. Also, thank you for keeping on the Birth certificate. Please add his student loan forms.
Dear Cuba, Please keep Carter this time. Thanks.

I find it kind of amusing that someone can call @AndrewBreitbart a Nazi and laud his censorship by Huffpo in the same tweet.
Dear @GOPleader please revoke Media Matters For America's 501c3 status, now that they have unveiled their new POLITICAL ACTION mission.
If anyone wonders why I rarely use @twitter anymore, it is because it is about as reliable as a 9 year old roll of film stashed in a drawer
Hey @KFOR Is there a grass fire near southside? It reeks of smoke outside and the sun is hazy looking.
Guess I should be thankful that acronym impaired folks on Obama's team did not say it was a Kinetic Intelligence Action.
The re-wording of America is alive and well in the "Kinetic Military Action" of "Odyssey Dawn".

@ianbeyer "I was in Desert Storm" or "I was in Odyssey Dawn." which sounds like a porn flick?

Odyssey Dawn? Who the hell is in charge of naming military actions now? A porn star?
@Dove Just beautiful little girls being beautiful little girls.
Dear @Dove As part of your "real beauty" campaign, you should sponsor a REAL pageant for little girls. No make up, fake hair, fake teeth.
I am now thinking that most of the hosts on MSNBC remind me of Arnold Horshack, with their deep need for attention. @glennbeck
But then....that is what MSNBC lives for, some small nugget of recognition from anyone at Fox News. @lawrence. like a sad puppy.
Really kind of sick creepy: seeing @lawrence O'Donnell go almost orgasmic replaying one @glennbeck sentence while quoting from the Bible.
Also @RepWeiner repeat after me. "It is NOT my money." Please repeat that as often as needed til you understand it.
Hey, @RepWeiner If you were speaking the truth it would not matter if it was 100 to 1. It would still be fair. Jesus took on a whole temple.
Congressman Weiner needs to say to himself every hour on the hour: "It is not my money."
Really NY? Is Congressman Wiener the best you can do?
Actually, @glennbeck the best way to help eliminate poverty is not through giving to charity, but by creating a business and employment.
Oh, and Obama is still a complete moron. That is all.
Dear News People, enough with the ethnocentric "How does the Japan Quake Affect the USA" angle already. 10,000 JAPANESE are dead.

@NCsoft_Support Oh, and for the record, Guild Wars would have to tie me down and remove my toenails with pliers before I would leave.
Hey @dominos What about those of us who don't LIKE white meat?
@NCsoft_Support Yes, it got resolved. I am still wary of using it to buy online. Did you ever fix the paypal interface?
I really dislike living in a world where innocent people pay daily for what criminal people do.
@ncsoft_support My decision is that since I cannot access my account I will no longer purchase anything from you.
@NCsoft_Support Incident  110303-004791
@NCsoft_Support I think my ncsoft account is just another online account that I have to blow off as "unusable" due to THEIR updates.
@NCsoft_Support I have a support ticket I put in last night, Got the standard reply back but nothing more than that.
And stupid @NCsoft_Support made the "online store" inaccessible. yea, great idea.
I was all excited about the new update for @guildwars til it became a wash for me. Level 9 in pre forever I guess.
@arenanet I am expected to remember CODES from games I have had 7 years to access my master account? REALLY?
@arenanet That is now two purchases that @NCsoft_Support has screwed you out of from me. Now no more permanently it seems.
@arenanet Also my pre character is level 9 with nothing to do, and Lt. will not speak to her. Grinding is not my thing.
@arenanet I would have purchased the mercs only @NCsoft_Support made it harder for me to get into my master account.
@NCsoft_Support First it was that your buy from paypal was wonky, now I must remember stuff from 7 YEARS AGO? WTF????
@NCsoft_Support OMG you made it even harder to buy something! I cannot even log INTO my master account now!!!! ACK
Dear @GOPleader Please this time let US tell you who we want as a presidential candidate and not vice versa. Thank you.
Maybe this would be a good time for Obama to go on another "Speech Tour" and give pretty speeches to make everything better in the world.
With everything that happened in the world today, CNN's Cafferty does a story on Sarah Palin. Obsess much?
It is so foggy! But....I like fog.
Apparently the Left is just learning that Michelle Obama's hypocrisy over her whole food obsession is fair game for political cartoons.
Apparently Lawrence O'Donnell has his undies in a wad over @JamesDHudnall 's cartoon. He wants us to ambush him at Starbucks.
It is too early. I am going back to bed.
@NCsoft_Support It is irritating when the NCSoft store will not process a purchase. It is so random.
RT @DanRiehl: So, like, if I see that shirtless beach photo of Obama on Craigslist, I guess he'll resign, too, right? It's worth a shot!!!
MSNBC is now feverishly working on an angle where they can blame Palin, Beck and Fox News for Rep. Lee's scandal, and resignation.
Total killed in "peaceful" protests in Egypt: 297. Not known how many were wounded, arrested, or missing.

Well, I guess History will say that Obama's first speech of his run for second term was Jan. 12, 2011.
@HeyTammyBruce I live in Oklahoma city, this is nothing like our memorial. This is a campaign event.
So are the media going to do an applause count on this speech like a SOTU address, as well and go full blown insensitive?
Ugh, Obama switches to "campaign speech" voice. ick. just...ick.
This is completely bizarre. Is this a memorial service or an Obama Political rally?
Thank you thank you thank you @jamieradtke for identifying the problem so clearly!!!
Holy cripes, @jamieradtke hit the nail on the HEAD about the shooting on @rickklein It is about our Mental Health policies!!!
Dear @GOPLeader do not turn the act of an insane person into an assault on the Constitution with some knee jerk bill in congress.
If bill to "protect" members of congress from "hate speech" passes, I know a lot of bloggers who will be in Jail soon.
One congress idiot has bill ready to regulate political speech, another has a gun control bill at ready. Knee jerk much?
Our Congress of course gets derailed by the shooting, and uses it as an opportunity to make an assault on 1st and 2nd Amendments.
Here is a hint: Blame the shooter.
It is also not surprising that the Left, without fail, must find blame outside of the perpetrator of any act of violence.
After the last 24 hours of insanity from the media, I can only come to the conclusion that they are as insane as the shooter.
@Ahrakeen So why are you up so early, or late....depending.

@Ahrakeen The big honking spending bill that was jerked from the Senate last night in the wee hours.
Argh, Now BOR is trying to take credit for the Omnibus failing. What an ego.
@Ahrakeen They spent the first year and a half maligning and dismissing it, without trying to understand it.
It is now TWO YEARS and CNN and MSNBC are still trying (and failing) to figure out the Tea Party.
@stephenkruiser Sometimes "fighting to the end" does not neccesarily mean "living to the end".
@stephenkruiser Is the chemo giving me a real chance at life, or robbing me of it?
@stephenkruiser Is there a real chance the chemo will make me better? Or are we buying time? How much time? How better will be the time?
@stephenkruiser Or should I be fighting for how I wish to die?
@stephenkruiser Sometimes it is a choice of what end do I want to have? The first question is what are the odds? Am I fighting for my life?
@stephenkruiser In a strange room, surrounded by strangers?
@stephenkruiser Is the choice to lay here sick, barely conscious of myself, the world I am leaving and my loved ones?
@stephenkruiser Sometimes it is not a choice of life or death, but a choice of what you want the end to be.
@stephenkruiser As a registered nurse I have had to explain what the end would be like to patient and family.
@stephenkruiser What are the odds if she starts the chemo? Sometimes if you are facing the end of life, you have to decide how to spend it.
In fact 2010 may go down as the year of "Its not Rape/Rape" unless we say so. If the left loves your rapist.
From reading both left and right blogs, and Olbermann/Moore, apparently rape is ok if you fall into particular political groups.

Did @Scott_Ott or @TheOnion write today's White House Schedule? @whpresscorps
(sorry about the cuss words, my tweeples, but I am gobsmacked) This is completely surreal.
@whpresscorps Now we know who said "F*ck the President" in that caucus, It was Obama.
So now we know who said "Fuck the President" in that caucus. It was Obama.
@JoleneAL This is the freakiest thing I have ever seen.
I wonder if he called George W. Bush to back him up too.
Then Obama leaves claiming he is being p*ssy whipped by his wife.
Holy crap, the reporter is asking Clinton a question about Obama with Obama standing next to him.
Wow, this is just bizarre, seriously.
Ok, this is the weirdest moment in the Obama Presidency so far, seriously.
Ok, this really makes Pingponghead look like a weakling. Is this like: "My brother can kick your ass!" in the schoolyard?
Good afternoon and happy Friday people. Why is Clinton on my television set in front of the White House podium?

@MarissaMartins I rarely look in the mirror anymore. Except to check my teeth after brushing. rofl
@ricklondon Paper of Pins.
@MarissaMartins That is much better than being a mind outside of a body.
Eventually all politicians would disappear into the black hole that eventually sucks in all socks.
I am thinking however it would be easier if we get Congress to pass a bill that all Politicians should dress up like socks.
So, my opinion is that a giant crevice should open up and swallow Washington DC whole.
@lovelytrinkets They do, and once you begin to get rid of them, it seems you find more and more.

So, if you are traveling. Make a note of whether these idiots change their gloves.
@MisterFreedom I am a Registered Nurse, I was wondering if they were using aseptic technique or is this a kind of McDonald's use of gloves?
Also, after the failed underwear and shoe terrorists, it is apparent that the packages they are attempting to use are NOT in Levi's.
@allahpundit She does not know what a madrassa is. Please remove her from my TV.
And, just to complicate the whole "glove" issue further, Are the gloves environmentally safe? Or is there a big pile of gloves somewhere?
@AlieGirl7 See they think the gloves are for THEIR protection, as I thought. They do not the first thing about aseptic technigue.
And if the gloves are not changed, then it would be easy as pie to just powder your clothes with bacteria and spread it via the TSA agents.
My question is this: Are these pat down "gloves" changed after EVERY passenger?
Ok, a thought on this TSA thing. Remember during the H1N1 scare, where people were not even shaking HANDS?

And with that I am going back into twitter hiding for a while. I am turning off media for a few days.
Just to be clear here, If I lived in Nevada, I would vote for a box of pudding rather than Harry Reid. It is called: Removing power.
Cannot say there is even one celebrity that I would "defend" by calling total strangers ugly names.
Good morning tweeples. Remind me not to attack the "demigod" @pennjillette. His worshippers spewed ugliness at me. Blocking ensued.
@pennjillette And I really do mean good night this time. I have a warm dog that needs petting and attention. You got my birthday rant.
@pennjillette I wanted the libertarian POV and you got caught in trifles, in the name calling cycle. Leave that for Don Rickles. night.
One last thing. The abortion argument always begins: Where/When does life begin?
Night tweeples.
Good night all, and to @mattjcooper my rant is ended. Sorry I tweeted too much in your estimation, and frightened you. @pennjillette
@pennjillette Now that your posse is attacking me, I shall bid you and twitter adieu, apparently your followers believe I should be silent.
@pennjillette No, I just expect more of you (in a serious debate) than to see you parrot mocking terms and name calling.
@nickmarschel It just gets nasty, I turned it all off for 3 days and I come back to this. Heard anything on Oklahoma races? er....no.
Ok, I have had my @pennjillette fit for the day. Happy Birthday to me. My faith in Human Beings is taken down a notch. sigh.
Like arrest records real or imagined, old juvenile records, the fact you did not learn to tie your shoes or were a bed wetter.
Clean out the closet of anything and everything unsavory, especially that particularly stinky bit in the corner. It reeks.
Next week will be pull anything out of the gunny sack that you have been saving week for mud slinging. Everyone get your flak vests.
Last week, as you recall was Homosexual week. This week it is obviously "Question everyone's faith week"!! Mark your score cards, folks.
So on the grand election cycle "talking points" and trying to pull social issues in, we are RIGHT ON SCHEDULE.
I know I have argued it for THIRTY YEARS.
The tape SHOWS that she asked "Where is the phrase "Separation of Church and State?" It is HOW THE ARGUMENT WITH LIBERALS begins. always.
@pafford Just parroted Marc Lamont Hill with "oh yea, crazy wacky, yea yea, nod" Where is the DEBATE? Let's just call people WACKY and done.
@skibbster eeep I turned him off. I was sad.
@pennjillette I expect logic and intelligent debate from you, not name caling and mockery. Facts in keeping with a LIBERTY spirit. I am sad.
You know, @pafford that feeling, another Libertarian speaking. Now we will get somewhere. Reason, logic...then pfff it was emotional crap.
@pafford He was on Larry King, I was flipping around and stopped to listen MAINLY because @pennjillette was speaking.
@pennjillette Truth based on what? You sounded like a robotic talking head mimicking Marc Lamont Hill's talking points.
I really hate it when someone I have respected for years falls to the dark side. sigh.
@pennjillette So when did you become a Democrat/progressive?
@Duh_Progressive Bad planning using  three of the only letter that has 3 syllables.
So now we have two Fake Libertarians: Bill Maher and @pennjillette. They should go on the road together, spreading hate and mockery.
Guess the whole "I am a Libertarian" thing was too hard for @pennjillette to live up to, he caved to the progressives.
Also, when did @pennjillette become a Democrat?
@dabzs Yea, I have been hiding out and just chilling but thanks for the regards on the day.
It is why it is so exhausting to argue with Liberals, because so much of what they believe is based on FALSEHOODS.
The audience knows as most conservatives know that EVERY argument with a  liberal begins by correcting their faulty HISTORY.
It ALWAYS starts there, and Then some liberal like  Maddow has to go LOOK it up. Christians have argued this since the Danbury Baptists.
Dear Rachel Maddow, you are wrong, Every Christian in O'Donnell's audience were laughing WITH her, because it is how the argument begins.
Well said. //RT @retiredfirecapt: Liberalism normally enjoys the demagogic advantage of appealing to emotion over reason.
RT @whpresscorps: RT @JimHeathONN President Obama won't take questions from Ohio reporters on his many trips here, but will appear on Da ...
In any case for those who have had this argument as many times as I have, @ChristineOD was right, in that it is not in the Constitution.
Most liberals are completely ignorant of the fact that the phrase "Separation of Church and State" does no appear in the Constitution.
I have argued the "Letter to the Danbury Baptists" argument a million times in my lifetime. sigh.
@glennbeck Could have a special "Golden Clown Nose" award for the special clowns.
@glennbeck Instead of a clown car, why not just buy a big box of red clown noses that squeak and mail them to the various clowns.

I am not chaninging it either, dagnabbit. I have said Catsup since I was a kid. Darn you Heinz! DEL MONTE WAS BETTER.

Thank you @twitter and @Support for making the lists I took so long to make useless by bad coding. They do not work.
I say Christine picks a very obscure case and skewer Nancy with it.
I aggreed with the Citizen's United case.
In all honesty, If there was one I wish they would have decided differently on, It would be the one that stopped the recount in FLA.

@AlieGirl7 CNN and streaming at the blaze. Prolly streaming over at Breitbart too.
@AlieGirl7 CNN also streaming at Bcast I think
Oy. If I hear one more slick car salesman statement from Coons I will go ballistic.
Here goes Coons into long long long talking points.
It belays an attitude of the heart.

Coons is such a slime ball. Come on Delaware.
For that matter let's bring back the shoulder flip.
I am demanding that ever woman that has this Jennifer Aniston hairdo give it up this year. It is over. Please. go pixie or something.
@Ahrakeen yea, it was jerking around so I left. I may join in the webcast aftershow of Bret Baier if they have it today.
@Ahrakeen I get frustrated with its lack of reliability and take long breaks waiting for them to fix it, but they never do.
@Ahrakeen Its like the chair that never gets fixed correctly and eventually breaks  and kills grandma.
@Ahrakeen To be honest, I have been here two years or more now, and they keep putting in new code on top of old bad code.
@Ahrakeen It is losing prolly well over half of who is listed. I would call that an issue.
@Ahrakeen Yea so I am just poking him to see if he will fix the lists database, something is horribly wrong with it.
@andylevy I think Red Eye should cover it live. I would pay to see that.
Dear @ev Even though you are no CEO anymore could you poke someone and tell them to fix the new @twitter it is broken. thanks.
Dear @twitter Please fix the new twitter. it is already broke and I just got it last week. Cheap chinese goods?

Come on, you KNOW how sweet it would be to retire Barney? Give a little to @SeanBielat  #onkneesbeggingpuleeeze

@AndrewBreitbart Reminds me of an dying octopus flailing in burning sand. Every tentacle grasping out for something...anything...to save it.
@Ahrakeen Oh, lots. we had an earthquake.
Just called KTOK they say they are aware of the problem and are working on it.
Had a good breakfast. No clue why KTOK went off the air.
@wxchannel It was scary.
@JoleneAL hehe ouch.
@ChiBarb I mean they scare me, but I have been trained since kindergarten what to do, and I am pretty sure I will survive one.
@ChiBarb Tornadoes don't frighten me, but then in Oklahoma we have the best storm chasers and meteorologists in the world.
@ILMsux The epicenter was 6 miles east of Tbird lake.
@ChiBarb Do people in California feel this kind of thing a lot? Man, I am sitting here afraid it is going to happen again.
Hahha I am such a wimp I am still shaking it scared me so bad.
@ChiBarb Lot of folks felt it! http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/dyfi/events/us/2010ciay/us/index.html
Dear California, please keep your earthquakes, they scare me. I will keep my tornadoes if you do so.

@Fausta I could seriously see you do a segment like your blogcast on @foxnews
Ok, so I returned but I am suspicious of @twitter losing tweets. I guess using twitter to READ others was not in the plan.
Night tweeples If I don't show up tomorrow, it is because I am waiting for @twitter to fix issues they have had for years.
Ok well the amount of suckage from @twitter is too much for me to stand. @ev Been around for years, still can't fix your issues. You suck.
The last time @twitter ticked me off this bad I took a 5 month hiatus.@ev
[@twitter rant mode set to seething]
@JIDF I love you.
I would say the reliability of your service stands at maybe 30 percent. @twitter I don't eat at Burger Joints with that kind of record.
@twitter some people's tweets have been COMPLETELY MISSING from my stream yet when I check their page they are not silent. @ev
You see, @twitter I have columns that show my lists, I can see when a tweet goes through one list and never makes it to another. HINT @ev
Maybe if @twitter would fix the bugs they have before they added "new" stuff the stuff they add would work better. @ev
Or perhaps @twitter should just put: Engineered by K-Tel on it as a disclaimer so I can drop kick it across my yard. @ev
In truth, @twitter should change its icon to a message in a bottle since there is about that chance of a tweet reaching a destination. @ev
Might explain why for two days most of my tweets are missing in my stream. @twitter once again is useless. Been here 2 years now. Same crap.

@D1ane But of course you are not hearing much about the fact that a US Company went down to help because we dont play that way.
@D1ane Exceptional US that I love. heh.
@D1ane Are they young?
@D1ane They would have come out around Christmas, but a US company said: Christmas? No way! And went down.
@D1ane The only reason they are coming out now is US engineering. A team from the US went down to assist.
They are saying that the miners will begin to come out around 8 pm CST #miners
@keder They are going to pull the miners out at 8pm ish central.

@FreeWeThePeople I would bring ya some if you were close by!
@Ahrakeen Medicare has a lot of fraud that is brought on by the very bureaucracy that oversees it.
@FreeWeThePeople Nope, got a lot of praying done tho! heh
@FreeWeThePeople Morning.
@NoWealthButLife I still use the first parts of it on occasion as material for Lectio Divina. Wonderful stuff.
@NoWealthButLife For me it was really just life changing.
@NoWealthButLife Well if you have not read St. Bonaventure's The soul's journey into God, you really should!!
@DLoesch Always a good sign.
@Beregond 45 minutes til I get my 10/10/10 10am.
I did not get much sleep, but I got some, and the coffee is hot. Morning tweeples.
@Ahrakeen Oh just some longer things I had been meaning to take the time to read.
@AlieGirl7 Same boat.
@Ahrakeen I am having a hard time sleeping so sitting here reading
The Govt. already had too much control of it. Has had for some time now.
In truth, there was no Health Care Crisis. Certainly the system needed to be tweaked. But the tweaking should have been to get the Govt out
It sat there and sat there until the time was right. Until the balance of power swung wildly to one side.
There once was a 2000 page bill.  Sitting in the bottom drawer somewhere. Imagine writing 2000 pages. How long would that take you?
"Don't take men like that seriously, but by all means, take them." --- Marilyn Monroe
@AlieGirl7 Thankee Kindly. I am hiding behind you, but I am locked and loaded.
@AlieGirl7 Bring me a butterfinger and tell the devil nanny nanny boo boo for me.
But some people put their careers on the line for us, and made our voice louder.
I am, of course suspicious because in the beginning we were so weak. Those of us who sat at kitchen tables and cried together.
It is a talking point for them. Because he is a loud voice.
In fact, many on the Left do that every day.
I am actually sitting here praying for @glennbeck And perhaps I am sensitive because he is often accused of "making money on the Tea Party"
Our line is drawn in the sand.
What we are saying I think sometimes, is....This far, and no farther.
That we may be sitting here on our own little piece of God's green acre, locked and loaded.
In the end, it is true, and most of us know it, that although we win the battle, we may lose the war.
@FreeWeThePeople Thankee kindly.
Anyone else who who feels I am not in this for the "right" reasons, feel free to unfollow me.
@GregWHoward Well since you are so important and busy then, I will give you one less to see. I wish you well.
@GregWHoward No, apparently you have decided to attack everyone, even me.
@GregWHoward It seemed passive aggressive, I was being honest with you.
@GregWHoward Alright, so you are angry at Dick Armey. For what? For the Tea Party Express?
@GregWHoward I did, afterall say the same thing in not so  many words.
@GregWHoward No, I am not egocentric. Why do you now resort to insults merely because I asked if what you said was meant for me.
@GregWHoward Is that really what you think I am saying? And why use passive aggressive mode?
@FreeWeThePeople Also been busy here locally, if you know what I mean.
@FreeWeThePeople I would have been there, but I am shy. *wink*
@FreeWeThePeople It is going to get nasty. Remember that for patriots the fire of freedom and liberty burns in our DNA.
@GregWHoward That is a distraction.
@FreeWeThePeople The Tea Party is stronger than all that.
@FreeWeThePeople They are barely clinging to that now.
@FreeWeThePeople They thought they had the ring when their messiah was the golden boy but it is slipping and so is he.
@GregWHoward Most of us know the path we are on.
@GregWHoward Stay calm. Get your facts straight. Don't be used by tools.
@FreeWeThePeople They are becoming irrelevant and are no more than tiny smeagols.
@FreeWeThePeople This is all attention seeking behavior
@FreeWeThePeople They are dying. When was the last time you saw them used as a source on any channel other than MSNBC?
@GregWHoward Don't do this. You need to step back.
@FreeWeThePeople The Daily Kos is in its death throes. The only reason the "apology" appeared was to get traffic to the site.
@AlieGirl7 Sheesh.  no kidding.
And there will be much gnashing of teeth.
We are in the trenches now people.
Awake too late and thinking too much.
@NoWealthButLife Heh, I like how you listed me, and it is quite accurate.
@Ahrakeen What are you doing awake, anyway
@NoWealthButLife At one time I observed canonical hours or office in prayer, but now I do good doing vespers and matins.
@NoWealthButLife And that....is probably more than you want to know. haha
@NoWealthButLife Since, in essence you "live" the life of Christ every year.
@NoWealthButLife I enjoy observing the Christian Year as it deepens my walk with God.
@NoWealthButLife I have read many of the early mystics, St. Bonaventure, St. John of the Cross, The cloud of unknowing. I am a prayer person
@NoWealthButLife I never could find an exact description for my beliefs. I am a contemplative, orthodox mystical Christian.
@NoWealthButLife I have gone to an Eastern Orthodox church, Greek Orthodox, etc. I am drawn to the early teachings of the Christian fathers
@Ahrakeen Sorry I got deep into making lists and cleaning up my twitter follower/follow thingy
@savethiscountry nummy numkins
@NoWealthButLife I am a confirmed Episcopalian, but have left the Episcopal Church. I still observe the Christian year.

@Ahrakeen I love Andrew Klaven. Always good.
Approximately One Million people are tweeted about an event re: The Tea Party via this system.
Now if those 1000 people also tweet to 1000 people.....
Approx. 1000 people who follow me, or I follow are Tea Party people around the United States.
Having worked most of the day on my followers and lists on twitter some interesting stats.
Off to do Saturday errands etc.
@tracycoyle And I will pray for your partner whether you like it or not! nyeh
@tracycoyle Also on another note entirely, I do not believe in Nursing Unions. It is direct violation of the Nursing Oath.
@tracycoyle But that is one of the reasons I am a libertarian.
@tracycoyle It is, to me, up to individual churches, their pastors, and their doctrines to decide who they marry.
@tracycoyle Marriage by the state to me violates the first ammendment, since it is a sacrament of the church.
@tracycoyle I actually do not believe in state marriage of any kind. All that should be civil contracts for any government benefit.
@tracycoyle As a nurse and long time Director of Nursing I can assure you that it is easier to absorb those costs than is reported.
It still irritates me that most Elected Officials do not follow back. If your boss was on twitter, would you not follow them? @GOPLeader
