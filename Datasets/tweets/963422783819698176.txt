Irrelevant — much of the Fentanyl is produced and shipped from China and not Mexico nor SA. Hence the vast majority of drugs are coming through our ports of entry and not from the southern border. That being said we should probably build the wall around China lol jk https://t.co/uB5AfJ6Kku
It amazes me how those addicts promote social responsibility over stupid self indulgent victim hood. It takes 2 mgs of Fentanyl to kill an average person and they die because they just don’t feel the need to take their lives seriously enough. I’ve got ZERO sympathy for those.

@DOROTHYVERAGEMS If you wouldn’t shame them for their sexuality, race, gender, class, level of education or faith, then don’t shame them for their addiction either.
@DOROTHYVERAGEMS It doesn’t work like it does in your fairytale land. No matter the situation, no one likes to feel judged or devalued. In order to encourage them to reach out for help, it’s important to reduce the stigma surrounding their situation.
@DOROTHYVERAGEMS They’re vulnerable and alone. Never mind more than 90% of people who suicide suffer from depression and/or substance abuse. That doesn’t matter to the people who don’t know how this disease works. You might say they can “just say no”.
@DOROTHYVERAGEMS They know they could be denied medical care, they could be treated like criminals even if they haven’t broken any laws. If that’s the case, why come out at all? Instead of asking for help, they stay as isolated as they were.
@DOROTHYVERAGEMS All their problems must be of their own making, right? You don’t think they realize that they have an issue? They know they could lose their job, home and loved ones.
@DOROTHYVERAGEMS You still want to refer to patients/victims as freaks, alcoholics, junkies and expect them to be ashamed of their disease when they’re already suffering from immense guilt and shame. Why? After all they’re addicts or as per you, “idiots”.
@DOROTHYVERAGEMS It’s defined as a DISEASE by most medical associations. No one chooses to develop the disease. Yet they’re not treated with the same dignity and compassion as people who cope with DM, HIV, cancer or any other chronic, relapsing illness.
@DOROTHYVERAGEMS No, I did not miss your point and your point is invalid. Addiction is not a matter of individual strength, morality or willpower. It’s a matter of how the brain becomes wired. Their brain chemistry has changed in a way that can be brought back into balance through rehab.
