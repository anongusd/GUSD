South Sudanese outcry has been undermined by the same people's who fought against injustices and marginalization by Khartoum.  The USA and Norway were the most friendly countries during our struggle against the injustices, human rights abuses. we are experiencing today in Juba.
SPLM has succeeded in making a country and Nation Building has remain a big challenge. A nation is not defined by its borders or the boundaries of its land mass Rather unified by a cause and a value system and who are committed to a vision and National diversity.

@Jongethon @Aquaengnoq Still, it will not control the situation rather it increases the criticism. The killing has never been a mean of controlling the subjects. @modernemeid @benygmabor @RadioMiraya @radiobakhita
The major problem of the SPLM is the absence of leadership. Success always passes through the chamber of the decision and they current SPLM leaders most of them were fighting forces of the movement. They lack political ideologies how to transform guerilla into the modern party.

@IGkimaiyo @UKenyatta we appreciate your work of building a strong team of police that will protect they citizens of Kenya and  A fricans
the changes in SPLA yesterday in juba will more again increase the crisis since those two Gen are again appointed in to military
@unmisspio and you do fail to protect they civilian that are in your camp. look at Akobo. malakal.Bor and other part of the country.
H: E salva kiir of south Sudan is a droning man on boat he is trying to help himself but the car lost control from him as a driver.
Is there any problem solved by condemnation?
why they rebel of @Drriekmachar are crying for incident in Bor at UN base then other atrocities they have committed in bor December?
@RebeccaBains thanks let hupe up at skype.majokmabior1
@smugera @MsaniiPrinceG we don't invited them but they use the economic powers to impost restriction on certain point now look at Libya.
@MsaniiPrinceG @smugera the UN will keep apologize concerning Africa issues they always take wrong side when it came for Africans issues.
whether Riek or kiir has a leadership behavior are they same only God know who will take over from them
@akwasisarpong thanks akwasi for knowing Africans cultures are so important
@tobias_simon start from Bor in 1991 and 2013. how many time did he wnated to reject the true? even he reject what he did in Bor.
salva kiir statement of yesterday will easily provoke his sold supporters of dinka Bor. we love peace that why our people are killed.
@tobias_simon @unmisspio @tobylanzer@AJEnglishmachar is not a new criminal and he can reject any thing. if he say no then who is responsible
If the US and UN can not stop fund refugees in Africa. The criminals will still take advantage of that.
@KellyO save journey sir @BarackObama

this work is for terrorist not for Dr like @Drriekmachar, u can call your self a leader when u are committing this atrocities
@MadingDeManyok our civilians are also fool they should not let them be use for politicians for their interest
@MadingDeManyok will this one bring any change in south Sudan?
though the situation in juba seem not be good we had a great Easter in juba south Sudan http://t.co/1CkCu8yFm7
the cause of this conflict is a result of SPLM/A kidnapping from the struggles which has been damp by the president
south Sudan problem is illiterate people that not need peace agreement to be sign but to take them to school to know their rights
Somalia would be better then south Sudan, they leaders must not take advantage of our people ignorance to use them
@AKyambadde dear sister am happy that we are friend with you and also happy to get in teach with educated people like u. i need scholraship
