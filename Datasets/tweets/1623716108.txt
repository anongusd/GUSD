A plan that is in the best interest of our troops, the American people, and the world. @realDonaldTrump has again failed to lead. The president must come before Congress for the authorization of any sustained use of military force.
Assad’s use of chemical weapons against his people, many of them children, is reprehensible and a violation of international law. The US and our partners must respond, but our foreign policy should not be dictated by a tweet. We need a clear plan.

Today we honor the memory of the six million Jewish people and millions of others who were murdered by Nazis in the Holocaust.  		After 70 years of remembering the Holocaust, the chilling statistics in this article make clear the work we still have to do: https://t.co/bnR9u3IRLl

This culture of aiding and empowering abusers while dismissing and belittling their victims must end. We have the power to end this cycle - and we must.

Rhetoric about who has a "bigger button" is beneath the dignity of the Office of the Presidency and dangerously reactionary coming from our Commander in Chief. This behavior is why I, and many other veterans, are lining up to continue serving in Congress. https://t.co/CZE5pjbUhM
Had so much fun all over the district today watching new Democrats get sworn in. I'm inspired by your hard work and perseverance and excited to see you all do great things. Great start to the New Blue Year! #HappyBlueYear #Flipthe8th

I pledge that I will not accept a single dollar from corporate PACs during the course of this campaign. Instead I will run a grassroots, people-powered movement focused on the every day people of Bucks and Montgomery Counties- not corporations.

In light of that, today I'm announcing another stop on my listening tour of the district. We'll be headed to Levittown on Sunday, January 14th at 3:00 pm. Location TBD - stay tuned!
We've heard time and time again from constituents of #PA8 that when they call Rep. Fitzpatrick's office to see how he intends to vote on major bills like the #GOPTaxScam his staff says he hasn't decided. We only find out his stances when he takes a vote.
We're seeing what happens when our representatives put party and donors over their constituents. Head to @Crowdpac to say why you're ready for a change in leadership in #PA8 https://t.co/O8496Dv5xV

ICYMI: my take on the #GOPTaxScam, and why it's a bad deal for the Middle Class. https://t.co/h3J36wRjy6
#GOPTaxScam is dead set on cutting Estate Tax that affects only 2 / 1000 richest estates. Tax could fully fund #CHIP, Children's Health Insurance Plan. Almost 9 million kids/moms need #CHIP for health care. GOP letting funding run out while they focus on what's important to them.

Today, @realDonaldTrump announced he's removing millions of acres of federally protected, pristine natural beauty. The great American outdoors are part of our national heritage-we must do all we can to fight back, &amp; ensure we can pass it on to our children.https://t.co/ILAKncZq5K
This is why the #GOPTaxScam takes from working &amp; middle class families and gives to families with over $11 million to pass on. To the GOP, if you don't have millions of dollars, it's not because there are fewer good paying jobs. It's because you wasted it on #boozewomenmovies. https://t.co/5nQPDQdDG6
I vow to be your accessible voice in Congress. See you at the next stop on the listening tour!
Thank you to everyone who came out to Coffee w the Candidate- I appreciate your voices and questions. #pa8 #papolitics https://t.co/aN1HTSXcIF

.@RepBrianFitz already voted yes on the #GOPTaxScam but there is still time to demand our Senators vote against this bill that increases taxes on Seniors and cuts vital programs they rely on. Call the switchboard today at 202-224-3121- to urge a no vote! https://t.co/3YRd9WKZXq
(2/2) We must appoint real leadership NOW. Fill the vacant head of the Office of National Drug policy and secure funding to address this epidemic which deeply affects our community. Lives depend on it.
(1/2) The appointment of Kellyanne Conway to Drug Czar by @realDonaldTrump's is a blow to the fight against the opioid epidemic. She has zero experience in drug policy, law enforcement, or public health. She is the wrong choice to lead on this critical issue.

@KevinGFox @RepBrianFitz Very disappointed. But it was just one more example of a pattern of behavior where Brian Fitzpatrick puts the wants of big donors and his party over the needs of his constituents and country. Lucky for us we can show him just how disappointed we are. #Midterms2018 #BlueWave2018
As a fighter for the middle class, I am incredibly disappointed in @RepBrianFitz's vote for the #GOPTaxScam. Read my statement: https://t.co/NPrleR6CsE

@tedsan We are actively engaging with this group and hope to earn an endorsement soon!
Even CEOs are admitting on TV that they wouldn't increase investments with a tax cut. This is proof that the #GOPTaxScam won't help the middle class, no matter what Trump and Congressional Republicans claim. I wonder if Brian Fitzpatrick still likes this plan. #PA8 #BlueWave2018 https://t.co/yLIpuucyMx
It might be a joke, but I doubt the working Americans are laughing. If you need more proof the #GOPTaxScam don't trickle down to the middle class, watch CEOs admit it on camera. https://t.co/0EqttSo0zs https://t.co/06AhRoJkYC

Maybe @realDonaldTrump's handpicked top economic advisor is hoping the voters aren't paying attention when he openly admits who he's really working for. I bet more repeats of the election results from last Tuesday would be quite a wake-up call. #BlueWave #GOTV https://t.co/231wS3rAyZ
Brian Fitzpatrick has a "very positive" impression of same tax proposal that Trump's chief economic advisor, in a rare moment of candor, described as "trickle down." They don't seem to get that you grow the economy from a strong foundation, not top down. https://t.co/jy6JXWwXUz
