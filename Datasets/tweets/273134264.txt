@seanhannity Sean...you were 1 of ONLY 3 COHEN CLIENTS...I heard your next!!!...
The LIAR MAFIA SENATOR walks back his witness tampering attempt and it WILL BE LEGALLY LOOKED INTO NOW. Cohen IS CREDIBLE. He is going to prison for lying. Do you think he will RISK LYING NOW??

@dmloop_loop @washingtonpost On August 2, 2018, the administration announced a 25 percent tariff on $16 billion worth of Chinese goods. The end result of the trade war that economists predict that a prolonged trade dispute will end up hurting American businesses and consumers and will end in a recession.
@dmloop_loop @washingtonpost Trump also signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. It repealed the ACA mandate that everyone must have health insurance or pay a tax. That allows healthy people to cancel their plans, leaving insurance companies with costly sick people. As a result, premiums are bound to rise. BAD
@dmloop_loop @washingtonpost Trump  stopped reimbursing insurers for their low-income customThey raised premiums 20 percent. He made short-term insurance more available. It's cheaper than Obamacare but doesn't have the same benefits. He also allowed states to enforce work requirements on Medicaid recipients.
@dmloop_loop @washingtonpost Obama used the Bush-era Troubled Asset Relief Program to create the Home Affordable Refinance Program. It rescued homeowners who were upside-down in their mortgages.
@dmloop_loop @washingtonpost Obama bailed out the U.S. auto industry on March 30, 2009. The federal government took over General Motors and Chrysler, saving 3 million jobs.
@dmloop_loop @washingtonpost Obama faced the worst recession since the Great Depression. He used expansionary fiscal policy to combat it. He signed the Economic Stimulus Act. This act created jobs in education and infrastructure, ending the recession in the third quarter of 2009.
@dmloop_loop @washingtonpost Trump entered office without a recession to fight. But he won the election on the impression by voters that the economic growth should be better. He promised growth of more than 4 percent. NOT His voters didn't realize that such fast growth is unsustainable and dangerous. Duped.
@dmloop_loop @washingtonpost I wont argue with a bias REPUB who uses ONLY REPUB sources to get his " facts". Sure the economy is doing good and we applaud this  but you ALWAYS forget the STAGE 1 rocket booster OBAMA created to give you all that progressive upward trajectory...why is that???

@Justice4Alex93 @RashidaTlaib Show you how shallow people are buying into non data rhetoric...most of the data shows the opposite...but the economy has been on an upward transition since 2008...that's a fact.its takes 2 full years for a Presidents policies to be totally felt within the economy.
@cahoon_stephan @RashidaTlaib They did...in El Paso....since they did that in 2008- 09 crime has gone up 17%. FACTS that TRUMP has NEVER looked at and pushes people like you to believe his unevidenced rhetoric...cuz that's all it is for Trump on EVERY BLOODY TOPIC!
@pollsofpolitics @deboonz @POTUS @realDonaldTrump 100%  RHETORICAL CLAIMS supported by really convoluted facts. No PLAN ON  HOW things will be done LIKE EVERY OTHER SOTU address.But he did threaten about being investigated and that progress wouldnt be forthcoming if they continued to INVESTIGATE him. A man with lots to hide!
@Liz_Cheney Trump threatened We cant have peace and bi partisanship if those INVESTIGATIONS are going on...there are 17 going on RIGHT NOW without Congressional investigations...thatll be extra. IF YOU CANT SEE THAT INVESTIGATIONS BY ALL THOSE LAW ENFORCEMENT agents arent bi partisan..wow!
106 Democrat WOMEN ELECTED...21 Rebublican women elected...YES TRUMP...There are more women in the workforce BUT THESE 106 are SPECIAL...they are coming for you the misogynist racist SEXIST President. Those numbers REFLECT ALL THE DIVISION AND IMBALANCE THAT TRUMP IS ALL ABOUT!
Trump  seriously MISREPRESENTED the " STATE" of the Union.The economy is strong. But the SOTU is divided bigtime. That's represented by the SENATE AND HOUSE.Trump never created ANY financial recovery. That was Obama...and it's been on the incline for 10 CONSECUTIVE years...
@buzzman888 @gaye_gallops But seriously MISREPRESENTED. The economy is strong. The SOTU is divided bigtime....its not Trump who created any financial recovery. That was Obama...and it's been on the incline for 10 CONSECUTIVE years...
@BillOReilly @NoSpinNews Its not a win or lose Bill. It's a SOTU. Trump once again LIED on some of those figures. Let's see how CONGRESS votes on those issues...that's where it ALSO counts.
@dmloop_loop @washingtonpost It's like a economic marathon. Trumps been riding the subway for 25 miles..gets out and runs the last mile then claims victory. The Economy has been on the rise CONTINUALLY for OVER 10 YEARS!
@dmloop_loop @washingtonpost How did  the " tax cut" and the enormous cost to business on Tarrifs which are paid for by Americans NOT Chinese? contributed to these highs?? The HOTTEST economy started via Obama has been on a continual   rise. Good news to share but it's not a recovery or turn around.. lol

@jamesstudy7 @heyitsCarolyn @angelchorus1 The bible is a collection of writings most of them heresay and many written to reinforce what they WANTED to believe.The JEWS never believed Jesus was the messiah.If he was right in their midst THEY wouldve known. Its Paul's FALSE NARRATIVE reinforced by second and third hand
@jamesstudy7 @heyitsCarolyn @angelchorus1 Pharisee:member of an ancient Jewish sect, distinguished by strict observance of the traditional and written law, and commonly held to have pretensions to superior sanctity.		a self-righteous person; a hypocrite		So....he was a STRICT teacher of JUDAISM....not christianity.
@jamesstudy7 @heyitsCarolyn @angelchorus1 Who wrote that? If it was Saul...it was likely a fit of epilepsy. He travelled with his physician because he was not well. Saul was probably subject to episodes of  epilepsy and not in a stable mental/emotional state.

@rickyschroder1 @McFaul The fact he is being investigated and for so LONG IS EVIDENCE theyve found things. Everything around him stinks of one thing or another. Many people have been charged..why would they ALL be involved in  Russian issues  except him?? But yet he has Russians in WH and innaguration?
@jamesstudy7 @heyitsCarolyn @angelchorus1 Except he was not the Torah IN THE FLESH He was a MAN in the flesh.Paul never met Jesus.All the stories are based on heresay. There is no "divine". There never was. Jesus was ONLY A TEACHER. Somebody had to fill the"prophecy gap".Jews didnt believe he was messiah.They would know.
@jamesstudy7 @heyitsCarolyn @angelchorus1 The vision....anyone can write a myth and call it a "vision". Respectfully there is just not enough evidence anywhere regarding visions or miracles or anything. Jesus taught Judaism..his apostles were Jews. Pauline christianity was CREATED by Paul...that's a lot of " visions".

Trump and his party are done...all he can do is complicate spin, dance away from the WALLS that are closing in on him. His party is being complicit..WHY...because they KNOWINGLY  took Russian money via NRA...now they fight to keep the storylines away via distraction OF THE WALL. https://t.co/1W2MrllD6c
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Trump done his COLLUDING WITH RUSSIA via MANAFORT who has just been found to have been sharing POLLING DATA on the campaign. He gave it to Russian Oligarchs whom he owed 20 million $ to and in exchange for it they got access to the President. So many Russians at the Innaguration.

@atensnut @DD93778941 Another delusional post. Somebody should tell this dude the Govt locked out the TRUMP family from ever having a CHARITY again. They are all complicit and being investigated... https://t.co/vkP4az6S8I
@SkepticNikki Well...Jesys was a Jew...so were his apostles. They didnt teach christianity. They taught Judaism. Paul's delusional interpretation didnt come till much later  They are still trying to meld Judaism with christianity to this day...NOW THATS STUPID. Those are facts
@realDonaldTrump THE GOP HAD THE HOUSE THE SENATE AND THE WH and couldn't get it done. You had ALL THE POWER TO MAKE THAT DECISION AND FAILED. How can you blame DEMS...that's just monstrously STUPID.... even a high school student can understand that much!!!
The FAKE BUSINESSMAN president Donald J. Scum...totally clueless...seriously. The" ART OF THE STEAL" https://t.co/5EiruL6HgR
@JuicyJesssy @krassenstein Satan is bullshit..put in place by people like this in the earlier centuries controlled through "the word"JESUS was a jew so were the apostles they taught Judaism not christianity which was all Paul's add ons came which came much later..its all bullshit. I studied this for years.
@krassenstein This is worse than superstition. They actually PUSH for the "rapture" to happen to fulfill prophecy. They have all kinds if fear mongering conspiracy theories that feed the "rapture" ideology even though it's a misinterpretation of the bible. That's a fact! YOU SHOULD BE SCARED!

This is why Presidents doing business in other countries needs to be brought to light. Financial interests of Trump have motivated him to not act in the interests of human rights and Democratic process as seen with the soft glove handling of Russia and the Saudis.
@seanhannity Oh...itll become LAW. Dont worry about that..this is how you fix the loopholes that let assholes like Trump run for President. There are a lot of Presidential "priveledge" protocols that also need to be cancelled. Pardons need to be EARNED to see that it's not a wasted priveledge

@MickVillene @ITDarkTiaLight @RossGilroy @TGranicAllen Guess you missed my previous posts on "owning" our own behaviours.
@MickVillene @ITDarkTiaLight @RossGilroy @TGranicAllen Oh I get it....its simple...its called behaviour..the ancients had no clue what or how to stop harmful behaviour or curtail it.The whole shaming theistic ideology was created around it....its stupidity in this day of information and technology at your fingertips to call it "sin".
@ITDarkTiaLight @RossGilroy @MickVillene @TGranicAllen If you remove the word sin and use the non moralistic judgement word and educated understanding of what  "behaviour" means....then we could be saying the same thing...everyone needs to OWN their own behaviour not attribute it to the "devil" or other realms that are unevidenced.

ETHICS.Obama once said he wouldnt send troops into Syria on the ground to look tough or for America to look tough or for "political reasons." His reason is that he visits the VET hospital once a week and see's the returning soldiers with their missing legs and arms and wounds.

@maddow @MSNBC the ONLY REASON Trump never fired Sessions before the election was because Trump waited to see if the Dems had subpoena power by WINNING the House. Because they won Trumps only move is to now quash Mueller with Whittaker who said previously he would cut funding.
@RebeccaBroad89 @JoeNBC Agree...Mueller should act ASAP and bring it on.
Trump has likely made a side deal with Whittaker offering him millions. ITS ALL he has left and it stands to reason because Trump is in JAIL as is his family members IF he doesnt stop it. This is OBSTRUCTION AND NOW HE SHOULD BE IMPEACHED. THE HOUSE NEEDS TO START THE PROCESS !
Public confidence needs to be high in the DOJ and its integrity, its impartiality, and its independence. With Whitaker that is impossible because of his spoken ties and views of non favor toward Mueller and his favor for Trump. HE NEEDS TO RECUSE HIMSELF ....PERIOD!
The video WAS DOCTORED UP!!! https://t.co/i3SOiKQQnT

Trump will be "rabbitting" now because he is terrified of Meuller...wondering if he has all those money laundering connections
@NBCNews THIS IS TRUMPS FREEDOM OF SPEECH IN ACTION. The Repubs fell for his business man vs career politician approach and drain the SWAMP MANTRA. So now Trump is  looking at CHRIS CHRISTIE for a position. Trump condemned career politicians and is now hiring them..clueless clueless...
@davematt88 Looks like Russia and China's way of handling reporters is now invoked in the USA! AA reporter said in response to those countries " if you dont hang together you'll hang alone." The words they used on Acosta are the same words they used there. "An aggressive reporter"..ya right!
@MSNBC The Press needs to be more assertive when the President says they are FAKE NEWS and ask him for EXACT EXAMPLES....and then nail him down further when he lies.

Why dont the media ask the bullshit artists they interview who claim they like what Trump is doing on immigration, economy, foreign policy ask them EXACTLY WHAT THAT POLICY IS...cuz nobody seems to know...that's because he doesnt have a policy...he has no sanctions on Russia .
@SarahPalinUSA Trump thinks mocking the disabled is funny...Ever notice Trump never talks POLICY? O the points of a proposed policy...he only fear mongers and demonizes everyone which is the laziest and oldest tactic in the book...effective because people never learn...until...its too late.

@freddyatton @grandmatojosie1 @realDonaldTrump How about ALL OF THEM!
@Superwoody68 @RealJamesWoods So ya...what you dont say ...can be a huge declaration...have you ever taken any courses on racism Woody?
@Superwoody68 @RealJamesWoods Your not good at reading between the lines are you. As a matter of fact it's not so much what you say but what you do....capice? Trump is now a nationalist...are you a nationalist woody? If you are that's fine but Trump assoc has been with white nationalist groups he wont condemn
@Superwoody68 @RealJamesWoods Well son...you need to stay away from FOX NEWS TO FIND OUT THE "WHICH IS"...I CANT EDUCATE YOU ON 2 YEARS OF FACTS FROM THE BULLSHIT ARTIST...try an executive order over the constitution...whatcha think pokey?
