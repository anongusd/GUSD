Great to see Trump demonstrating the art of the deal, getting China to commit to buying $1.2 trillion in U.S. goods. More work to be done, but a good sign. https://t.co/fk6nNPE0I9
People on the Left like Adam Schiff won't stop floating conspiracy theories about the President and wasting taxpayer resources. It’s time for the left to start actually trying to solve problems, not just obstructing to delay to the next elections. https://t.co/Itt0ac9JNr
Every time the Left tries to claim President Trump is down and out, he comes back strong for the American people that recognize his efforts for them. The numbers say Trump’s 2020 chances continue to rise. https://t.co/KaU7EU2Gpv

The 'deal' Congress passed last week failed to allocate necessary funds to build a wall where our agents say one is needed. While I couldn't support that deal, I do support @RealDonaldTrump taking action to do what is needed to immediately commence construction on a border wall.

This is the SECOND time Chuck Schumer has shut down the government over the interests of illegal immigrants. Why can’t he make the safety of his own fellow citizens the priority?
Here is an urgent New Year’s resolution for the left – Americans want secure borders, can you help us pledge to keep our borders secure in 2019?
#HappyNewYear! Looking forward to representing Missouri once more in 2019!
In 2018 we mourned the loss of a terrific president as well. Still #Remembering41 and his contributions to America and to the world.
Even during a shutdown, #NYE is a good time to look back on all the highlights of 2018… we saw employment increase, got taxes cut, and passed bills to boost investment in rural communities.
Leader Pelosi, can we find some common ground that still keeps our borders secure? https://t.co/k7EsWW9qPT
In fact, I wish Leader Pelosi was even around these days. But turns out she booked it to Hawaii to vacation after she shut down the government. https://t.co/RHMlR2PclS

Remember the meltdown on the Left that resulted in this #shutdown? It involved Pelosi implying she “mommed” our President. https://t.co/qWxrlnDRgf
Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and the rest of the Left try to paint border security in an evil, immoral light. But it’s just the opposite. Border security keeps us safe and ensures that the rest of the world respects both our boundaries and the rule of law.
Either our borders mark America as exceptional, or they don’t matter at all. We need to respect that a border means something.
A very Merry Christmas to everyone!

Let this sink in: 25% of the government will be shutting down because Pelosi won’t compromise for less than 1/10 of 1% of the federal budget to fund National Security.

Like the Naval Academy earlier this week, today the U.S. Navy celebrates its birthday – #OTD in 1775 the Continental Congress establishes an American naval force. #AnchorsAweigh!

The current federal estate tax is 40 percent … and Dems want to raise it to 65 percent while lowering the exemption if they take back Congress. Here’s an idea – let’s make it ZERO instead.
In fact, “the Trump administration has trimmed 16,000 [federal] jobs since the beginning of the President’s term in January of 2017.” Good news all around. https://t.co/eX3Iso5m5u
Jobs are growing in the private sector – more than 400k new jobs in Aug/Sept – but shrinking in the public sector.
St. Louis Cardinals history: #OTD 1967 Bob Gibson wins Game 7 of the World Series (his 3rd win of the WS!) and the Cards take title under the great Red Schoendienst. Took place 51 years ago – they’ll be talking about this one for another half century and beyond.
How hot is the economy right now? Well, the nation’s GDP rose 4.2% last quarter. You read that right. And, yes, we never saw numbers like that when Obama was president. Of course, he didn’t cut taxes and slash regulations, either. #TrumpEconomy
Feeling good about the economy? You’re not alone. In fact, consumer confidence in the economy is at an 18-year high. Thanks, #TaxCuts!

Latest liberal craziness? Pushing to let illegal immigrants vote in U.S. elections. Terrible idea – it undermines value of American citizenship, and dilutes the voting power of law-abiding U.S. citizens.

Nancy Pelosi said the #SCOTUS vote did “violence” to the reputation of the Senate. Not quite, Nancy. Your allies Schumer, Booker, Feinstein et al tried their best to destroy the Senate’s credibility. It was defended only thanks to #GOP support for Justice Kavanaugh.
The pro-abortion forces on the Left think nothing of establishing a market for body parts of aborted babies. That must come to an end. #ProLife https://t.co/pXNkh2I0Wc

1969 was a big year for U.S. history – man walked on the moon that year. Oh, and it was the last time the unemployment rate was as low as it is right now (just 3.7 percent last month). #TrumpEconomy
If the horror-show over the #SCOTUS nomination of Justice Kavanaugh doesn’t demonstrate need for more #GOP Senators, I don’t know what will. Have a feeling this issue has really energized voters here in Missouri as well as North Dakota, Montana, and elsewhere.

.@realDonaldTrump was 100% right tonight: we NEED to get to the polls this Nov. to elect @HawleyMO and @GOP everywhere. The stakes are HIGH: if we don’t vote Claire McCaskill and Pelosi Democrats will win and force Medicare for All on us - higher taxes and less care for seniors.
Make no mistake: There is a *direct* correlation between the strong U.S. economy and the policies pushed across the line by Trump and the GOP Congress (tax cuts, deregulation, etc).
“The two enemies of the people are criminals and government, so let us tie the second down with the chains of the Constitution so the second will not become the legalized version of the first.” ~ Thomas Jefferson #ConstitutionWeek

The #TrumpEconomy is synonymous with poverty reduction. From 2016 to 2017, the mean monthly food stamp caseload fell by 1.7 million people. This is GREAT news – and you’re probably not hearing much about it from the MSM.

#TBT … Last Thurs, as the Left was staging their political theater against eminently qualified Kavanaugh nomination, Senate GOP confirmed 8 more committed Constitutionalists as federal judges. Didn’t grab the headlines, but very significant.

Leftist scaremongering on Kavanaugh (“hazardous to your health” … “a dire threat” … “We’re fighting like our lives are on the line”) is belied by what America saw last week – a sober, thoughtful, measured, immensely qualified gentleman who will be great addition to Court.
“U.S. economic growth was a bit stronger than initially thought in the second quarter, notching its best performance in nearly four years and putting the economy on track to hit the Trump administration’s goal of 3 percent annual growth.” https://t.co/OfQvpFrF4x
U.S. economy added 201,000 jobs last month … the 2018 avg has been 207,000 per month, which is even higher than 2017’s 182,000 new jobs per month. This is an economy that is working for Americans.
Did you know that half the Dems on the Senate Judiciary Committee announced opposition to Brett Kavanaugh *before* the #SCOTUS hearings even began? Talk about close-minded.
Such impressive economic numbers: 201,000 jobs added last month … unemployment stays below 4% … and avg hourly earnings grew at best rate in a decade. Proof that #GOP economic policies are working. https://t.co/IdAyc7lVTq

How strong is this economy? Recently recorded the lowest monthly level of unemployment benefit applications since 1969. What an accomplishment for the #TrumpEconomy.

Touched base with Farmington Chamber of Commerce last week for in-depth talk on the economy. Was happy to report on “Tax Cuts 2.0” – our plan to make the temporary features of last year’s #TaxCuts permanent. https://t.co/qZmrioDbF3
I’ve been honored to work alongside President Trump for policies that help Missourians keep more of their paychecks, and he’s traveling to Cape Girardeau on Sept 13 to see this impact firsthand. Register here: https://t.co/mUp0WdiJaE https://t.co/CBRUA0mMm4

“Freedom isn’t free. To be preserved, it demands vigilance. To be defended, it requires strength. To be secured for our children and our grandchildren, it calls for the loyalty of patriots and the courage of warriors.”  ~VP Pence to the American Legion 8/30
In NY gubernatorial debate, Andrew Cuomo called ICE “a bunch of thugs.” Sorry, Andrew, you have it backwards. ICE actually arrests thugs and works to keep Americans safe. #Outrageous #BorderSecurity https://t.co/HKQiJ0vfUd
ICE arrests last year stopped suspects from peddling drugs, murdering people, and committing sexual assaults, including sex trafficking … yet the Dems call for ICE to be abolished! It boggles the mind. #BorderSecurity
ICE also made nearly 5,000 gang arrests last year, and removed nearly 5,400 suspected gang members from the U.S. Now THAT’S protecting the homeland. #BorderSecurity
Why do we need ICE? Agents removed 226,000 illegals in 2017, and made &gt;143,000 administrative arrests. Yet Nancy Pelosi’s party wants to abolish this critical national security agency. #BorderSecurity
Big news for @SEMissouriState. Congratulations on leading the nation in this critical field! https://t.co/fp6gExjTzo

Taxpayer $$$ shouldn’t be used to fund abortion, but the party of Pelosi and Schumer makes it a priority. Trump Admin proposed regs to restrict Title X taxpayer funding from subsidizing abortion. #ProLife

Re: the 4.2% GDP growth during the 2nd quarter … Is that the economic “Armageddon” Nancy Pelosi promised if we passed #TaxCuts last year? Not sure she knows what the word actually means. https://t.co/tEFxwQGNJ7
Did you see those new economic numbers? Wow! #GDP rose at annual rate of 4.2% during the second quarter of 2018 – which was the first full quarter with #TaxCuts in effect. #TrumpEconomy https://t.co/mxj1FeDzRr
Looking forward to Ways and Means hearings soon on making key features of last year’s #TaxCuts permanent – particularly the doubling of the Standard Deduction and the Child Tax Credit.

As of #LaborDay 2018, there are 162 million people in the workforce – more than at any time in American history. More evidence of the American economic juggernaut.
Happy #LaborDay – Let’s talk #Jobs. Since President Trump’s election, 3.8 million jobs have been created, including 400,000 #Manufacturing jobs. Unemployment is down to 3.9%. Those are signs of an #Economy that works.
Labor Day is, as Reagan said in 1984, “a fitting opportunity to salute those who built our great nation and whose spirit, hard work and courage are now building a new era of lasting economic expansion filled with greater opportunities for all our people.
Happy Labor Day. Be safe today at the BBQs and picnics as we bid farewell to summer. And let’s take time to reflect on the bounty and abundance produced by Americans’ hard work.
Definitely worth a read. https://t.co/PmPevuXNEf
Big day in American history: World War II came to a conclusion #OTD 1945 with Japan’s formal surrender aboard the battleship USS Missouri. Always worth a visit to the Mighty Mo if you find yourself at Pearl Harbor.
Another big lesson from visiting 30 southern MO farms this month: Farms and agribusinesses in #MO8 are poised to invest and expand and grow thanks to $$$ made possible by #TaxCuts.
Hmm, voter fraud *and* illegal immigration … For Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and their friends on the Left, it would appear to be a two-fer! https://t.co/CXxncpzZDd

“I think he has a lot of potential” might well be the understatement of the year. Congrats to Cape G Central’s Michael Hwang. This kid is going places! https://t.co/fsx6Bd5xAy
Nine out of ten farms in Missouri are family-owned. But too often Washington bureaucrats assume all farms are giant agribusinesses. My job in Congress is to represent the #smallbusiness farmers who make up such a huge part of our economy.
And I remember when Nancy Pelosi and the Left warned of economic “Armageddon” if we passed #TaxCuts (yes, she really said that!) … Some Armageddon we’re seeing! https://t.co/9R2jtBaTmX
Farming has changed quite a bit since I was growing up. Constantly amazed at how technology is used to produce more efficiently and safely – everything from GPS and temp/moisture sensors to drones and advanced software. High-tech stuff!
Here’s a back-to-school #FarmFact. One acre of soybeans can make more than 82,000 crayons. Of course, soybeans do a lot more than just help make crayons. It’s a $2.3 billion-per-year business in Missouri.
Lots of #MO8 farms are having hard time finding help. Why? B/c federal welfare programs incentivize too many people to avoid work and stay out of workforce. Does it make sense for farms and other small businesses to compete with DC for labor?
As I told Moore &amp; Moore: “Employers have to compete with their own government. … It’s not sustainable – for business or for the government. We shouldn’t pay able-bodied people to stay out of the workforce.” https://t.co/xOWA6S4qUy

Impressed by how Worrell Farms in Pemiscot County maximizes their resources – once they harvest their rice they flood the fields for winter to attract ducks. #SmartFarming https://t.co/hbjWWAl5BE
Missouri’s farms are the heart and soul of the state’s economy. In fact, all Americans would be wise to keep in mind how U.S. farming is central to everyday life. As I often point out, when #agriculture industry struggles, so does #MainStreet.
More than 1 in 10 working Missourians employed in #agriculture. But the ripple effects of that employment go far wider. Whole towns and communities in Southern Missouri support our farmers.

Biggest takeaway: Farmers just want to be able to work their land how they know best w/o Washington getting in the way. #MO8
What a month! Throughout August I traveled to all 30 counties in #MO8 and visited dozens of farms. Always amazed at what the men and women of Missouri agriculture do to feed and clothe the world and to support the Missouri economy. So proud to represent them in Congress.

Been hearing a lot more this week about what’s on the minds of Missouri #Farmers, from market access to the effects of the drought. So good to stay in touch with those making up backbone of state economy
America is truly “Open for Business.” Soaring GDP growth. More than 3 million jobs created since @realDonaldTrump took office. Low unemployment. And sky-high consumer confidence. #TrumpEconomy
Paying “tribute to the men and women who make freedom possible.” Was proud to be with @realDonaldTrump at VFW national convention. Watch his remarks. https://t.co/g9sY7nTiyw
I don’t know what’s worse – the guy who defaced the Donald Trump star on the #Hollywood Walk of Fame, or the lunatic leftists who cheer on this deranged behavior. But both are very disturbing.
U.S. lost 200,000 #manufacturing jobs during the Obama years … but w/ #GOP Congress and President Trump, domestic manufacturing is coming back – More than 400,000 manufacturing #jobs added since Trump election!
“Year before I came into office, private business investment grew at only 1.8%.  Last year, it jumped to 6.3 percent.  ...  And this year, it’s growing at 9.4%.” ~ President Trump last week #TrumpEconomy
Great read about work vs. welfare, especially at a time when surging U.S. #Economy is desperate for qualified workers! https://t.co/9d5ngbvxFE
Last year ICE made 143,000 arrests. Of those, “92% had a criminal conviction, a pending criminal charge, were an ICE fugitive or were processed with a reinstated final order” according to govt stats. So why does the Left want ICE abolished?
For years we’ve heard about the death of American #manufacturing … but thanks to #TaxCuts and the #TrumpEconomy, manufacturing confidence is soaring, and jobs are coming back!
Seeing some historically good economic news these days. #TrumpEconomy https://t.co/BhNz3Jk63D
Still trying to wrap my head around last week announcement that 2Q economic growth was an astounding 4.1% -- Impressive! That’s something the left-wing pundits said we wouldn’t see.
Most Americans think of 9/11 as a cold-blooded murderous attack on Americans on our soil. Nancy Pelosi? She downplays it as an “incident.” Wow. https://t.co/KK9Bvp4B6T
That’s some good-looking headgear! https://t.co/npLNio1Nv1
Last week in open-borders insanity: One congresswoman on the left called ICE the “Gestapo,” while The Nation magazine called it an organ of “an unbridled white-supremacist surveillance state.” What planet are these people living on?
Second quarter growth of 4.1% is testament to the power of #TaxCuts and historic regulatory reform. The GOP Congress and the Trump administration make good partners, to the benefit of the American #Economy.
Talk about unhinged: Leading Liberal Senator calls support for #SCOTUS nominee Brett Kavanaugh – whose only crime appears to be fidelity to Constitution – complicity in “evil.” Am gobsmacked. What is wrong with these people? #GetaGrip https://t.co/3hLewGqBVk

Great point: “ICE was formed over 15 years ago, which begs some questions: Where have these protestors been for the last 15 years? Did they march in the streets during the Obama Administration?” https://t.co/9oNQRBou50
Did you know that 30% of ICE workforce is made up of U.S. military #veterans? Hardly a surprise. They defended the U.S. abroad. Now they are defending us at home. #SecuretheBorder

Confirmation of Judge Andrew Oldham last week means BIG record set by Trump Administration – most judges confirmed by end of president’s 2nd year, with 23. Previous record held by George H.W. Bush. Let’s extend that record with Justice Kavanaugh and others! #SCOTUS
Liberal priorities: Abolish ICE yet establish sanctuary cities to protect dangerous criminals. This article shows why the Left’s approach is madness. https://t.co/H4pXxeB9sK
As a fourth generation family farm owner, I am proud to represent the hardworking men and women of Southern Missouri agriculture on Capitol Hill and to help protect rural America’s way of life.
Dems' new slogan this Fall is “For the People” … I guess they realized that highlighting their real agenda – “Abortion, Higher Taxes, and Illegal Immigration” – doesn’t fly with the American people. https://t.co/DdCnlzqDk7
The Left has gone around-the-bend on its anti-ICE craziness. https://t.co/NZue9fxs6V
Leading Liberals want to abolish ICE … an agency that last year made nearly 5,000 gang arrests, rescued over 500 human trafficking victims, and saved 900 kids from child exploitation rings. I don’t get it … They want to shut down ICE why exactly?
22-to-1 – This doesn’t get as much attention as it should. It’s the ratio of regulations repealed for every one added under President Trump, and it’s a big reason the #Economy has taken off.
This headline is really good for a laugh. Someone fetch a doctor quick – I’m not sure Elizabeth Warren has any feeling in her toes! #Hypocrisy https://t.co/0r8xsWECqw
I never have more fun than during my annual deep-dive into Southern Missouri agriculture. So great to meet with the men and women who farm our rich lands and waters and to take their concerns to Washington.

Remember worries during the bleak Obama years about #Economy? Today consumer and business confidence are at all-time highs, and 95% of manufacturers are optimistic about the future. #TrumpEconomy #TaxCuts
The strong #Economy is benefitting nearly everyone. Women’s unemployment is at the lowest level in 65 years … African-American unemployment and Asian unemployment at record lows too. #TrumpEconomy #TaxCuts
I’ve said it before but it bears repeating: The #Economy has created 3.7 million jobs since the 2016 election. That is an economic engine running on all cylinders! #TrumpEconomy #TaxCuts
Liberals are throwing the kitchen sink at Judge Kavanaugh to keep a principled Constitutional conservative off the #SCOTUS. Hint: It won’t work. https://t.co/HImQYQbQv6
Soybeans, corn, timber, rice, wheat, milk, catfish, honey, wine, sheep, and so much more – Southern Missouri farms an almost endless array of products that feed people around the world. What an engine of Show-Me State economic strength!
Joined @realDonaldTrump in MO yesterday to honor our county’s great veterans. Working with our President over the last 18 months has meant a safer America w/lower taxes, more jobs, thousands of regulations repealed &amp; protecting our constitutional rights. More great things coming! https://t.co/SNIgk6fRfH
A lot of economists are predicting 2nd quarter economic growth of FOUR percent. During the Obama years our leaders said that kind of economic growth was impossible. #TrumpEconomy

“Don’t make up new constitutional rights that are not in the text of the Constitution. Don’t shy away from enforcing constitutional rights that are in the text of the Constitution.” ~ Judge Brett Kavanaugh #SCOTUS
“The judge’s job is to interpret the law, not to make the law or make policy. So read the words of the statute as written. Read the text of the Constitution as written, mindful of history and tradition.” ~ Judge Brett Kavanaugh #SCOTUS
There’s definitely something strange in the water out in Hollywood. https://t.co/sqlLDlylTz
“Another sign that the labor market is nearing the best health it has seen in decades.” Good take on the current economic resurgence under @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/R3IdsRu1lb

In 2017, ICE arrested more than 127,000 illegal aliens with criminal convictions or charges, including 1,800 homicides, 2,000 kidnappings, and 5,000 sexual assaults … So why do so many liberals want to abolish ICE?

“And when our servicemembers return to civilian life as veterans, we must ensure they have access to the best care, treatment, and support in the world.” ~@realDonaldTrump, Salute to Service dinner 7/3/18

Here’s the difference between political conservatives and liberals: We conservatives believe first and foremost in the Constitution. Liberals put illegal immigration, gun control and big government ahead of any regard for that sacred document.

Obstructionists in Washington vowed resistance and opposition to President Trump’s Supreme Court pick before it was ever announced. Why should anyone take them seriously?
The Left’s hysterical reaction to the president’s #SupremeCourt nomination – of an eminently qualified and reasonable jurist – proves just how right he was in his selection!

Can you believe Liberals’ reaction to the boffo jobs news that a record number of Americans were employed? #Jobs #Economy https://t.co/FhcoYyXUxn
Yesterday’s #SupremeCourt pick is a real home-run by @realDonaldTrump. As a candidate in 2016 he promised to nominate #ConstitutionalConservative judges. As president he is keeping that promise – hit it out of the park with this one!
And while Chuck Schumer celebrated abortion on #IndependenceDay, the DNC issued what USA Today termed a “bleak July Fourth statement.” Compare that to #GOP message of hope and optimism about Making America Great Again! #MAGA https://t.co/AdLv4owLQD

“Jobs, jobs, jobs” – That’s how @realDonaldTrump summed up the news about record U.S. employment in latest economic report. https://t.co/j9PUdu4EJX
The Left wants to eviscerate the 2nd Amendment and ignore the plain text of the Constitution. The president’s selection of Brett Kavanaugh for #SupremeCourt makes realizing Pelosi’s and Schumer’s ambitions a lot harder.
Senate should confirm Brett Kavanaugh as next #SupremeCourt justice ASAP – an extraordinarily qualified nominee, should be on Court in time for this fall’s term. #AdviseandConsent
What should we desire in a #SupremeCourt justice? Absolute fidelity to the #Constitution and a healthy respect for the rule of law. Those qualifications are on display in spades with Brett Kavanaugh.
Kudos to @realDonaldTrump for nominating Brett Kavanaugh to #SupremeCourt. A big victory for the Constitution and for reasserting the rule of law in this country, not the rule of liberal judges.

Thomas Sowell nicely summed up the problem with Liberalism: “Liberals seem to assume that, if you don't believe in their particular political solutions, then you don’t really care about the people that they claim to want to help.” So on the mark.
It’s been six months since our historic tax cuts became law. So how’s the economy doing? We’re creating jobs, raising wages, GDP growth is soaring, and consumers are optimistic again. A success no matter how you slice it.
Six months after passage of #TaxCutsandJobsAct and the economy is more robust than it’s been in years. People are feeling it in their pocketbooks – 90% of Americans are seeing bigger paychecks as result of law.

The House of Representatives has been working hard since January 2017 to get the people’s work done. With 500 House-passed bills awaiting Senate action, the Upper Chamber needs to step it up and get to work.

More than 500 bills passed by the GOP House of Representatives and supported by @realDonaldTrump are awaiting action in U.S. Senate. #Obstruction
Senate liberals have forced more than 100 cloture votes on Trump nominees … compared to just 12 during first two years of Obama presidency. More than 180 nominees STILL awaiting Senate confirmation. #Obstruction

Big feature of #TaxCutsandJobsAct that helped spur the economy was the doubling of the Child Tax Credit. But this provision is only temporary. I have introduced a bill to make it permanent. Families planning for their future deserve some certainty from Washington.

And let’s not forget to wish a Happy Birthday to @realDonaldTrump. It’s his day, but Americans have been gifted with tax cuts, a robust economy, and a renewed sense of optimism since his election.

Senate Dems have forced 101 cloture votes on Trump nominees. Each can represent 30 hrs of debate on Senate floor. Why is this outrageous? Avg # of cloture votes for every presidency Carter thru Obama was – get this – FOUR. #DraintheSwamp
Liberals abuse Senate rules by forcing nearly every single Trump nominee to cloture, which can mean 30 hours of debate, even those with unanimous support. What a waste of time! #DemocraticObstruction
Good move by Senate to cancel August recess in response to Dem obstructionism. Countless hours wasted to protest Trump nominees have meant needed appropriations bills not passed. Something for Liberals to think about while working this August. #DemocraticObstruction

What have the GOP Congress and @realDonaldTrump meant for the economy?https://t.co/Gyq1zIBRnL
Former Democratic congressman Henry Waxman recently said, “I don’t think the American people want Democrats in charge to be pursuing impeachment.” He’s right. Problem is the current Dems in Congress don’t agree.
Dems’ platform if they win Congress this November amounts to little more than raising your taxes, defending MS-13, and trying to undo the 2016 election with impeachment. No thanks.
What’s at stake this November? Remember that Maxine Waters has said her “greatest desire was to lead Donald Trump right into impeachment.”
Gallup: “Optimism about the availability of good jobs has grown by 25 percentage points since Donald Trump was elected president.”

The federal govt should stick to doing those things it can do well and that local communities cannot – i.e., provide for the common defense, handle the nation’s foreign affairs, and oversee interstate commerce.
The further government sits from the people it serves, and the more removed it is, the less well it can do the job it purports to do. That simple observation is why most political decisions are best left to the states and local communities, not Washington.
Tennessee just took steps to ban sanctuary cities in the Volunteer State – a big victory for the rule of law. By offering no haven to illegals, it strengthens our nation’s border and keeps us safer.

Trump efforts to cut regulations having positive effects, but there’s still a lot more to do https://t.co/moOCbnSDHt
Recently noticed the Left trying to tie insurance premium increases to GOP ... What baloney. Soaring insurance premiums are DIRECT result of terrible ObamaCare law, which Dems have fought tooth and nail to keep in place.
#2018FarmBill would save $9.2 billion thanks to stricter work requirements for Food Stamps – good policy that saves $$$ while lessening crippling dependence on government. Portion of savings goes to state training/jobs programs.
Great from @realDonaldTrump at NRA convention: “Your 2nd Amendment rights are under attack but you will never lose them as long as I'm your President... We believe that your freedom is by our creator and no government can take that away.”

Ronald Reagan in 1981: “Government regulations impose an enormous burden on large and small businesses in America, discourage productivity, and contribute substantially to our current economic woes.” As true today as it was back then.
Looking forward to simpler tax filing process next year as result of Trump/GOP tax cuts. Doubling of the Standard Deduction will make filling out taxes far simpler for many more Americans. Your time is money – now you’ll be getting a lot of that back.
Americans spend 2.6 billion hours on their tax returns, a compliance tax that robs us of time we should be spending on literally anything else, like your farm, your family, your business, etc.
Here’s another measure of the growing strength of the U.S. economy: the 4.1% unemployment rate is the lowest since the turn of the century.
Over 600,000 new jobs created since Congress passed #TaxCutsandJobsAct in December. That’s putting people to work!
It was great to talk with so many friends and neighbors at the Texas County Lincoln Day.

Want to receive food stamps? If you are an able-bodied adult, then you should work at least 20 hours as a requirement to get welfare benefits. New Farm Bill will cement this sensible requirement.
Work requirements for receiving food stamps are the most helpful for those receiving government assistance. Help people get back on their feet. By encouraging work, we can end someone reliance on government – that’s compassion
Very much worth a read: https://t.co/LpxG6Niiph

More profitable to receive assistance than to work? Over 42 million Americans on SNAP/Food Stamp program – a 50% increase since 2008. That’s trending in the wrong direction. Stronger work requirements make sense.
Repeal the Death Tax! Last year’ tax cuts pared it back, but I say we should eliminate it outright. Have introduced legislation that would drive a stake through its heart and finish it off once and for all.

Regulations are hidden taxes – they cost the avg household $15k per year according to new study. That’s too much … which is why the GOP Congress and President Trump have been working since 1/20/17 to slash regulations along with income taxes.
Federal regulations cost the economy $1.9 TRILLION each year according to new study. Trump/GOP effort to roll back many regulations in 2017 did a lot to goose economy and shock the DC system … but there’s still a long way to go! https://t.co/ks8QLxeBrk
GOP approach to food stamps and welfare looks to provide opportunities to those who are work-capable, while dedicating resources to the truly needy and helpless. Liberal opposition is nothing less than shameful.

If tax cuts are good – and they are – then more tax cuts are better. Let’s build on momentum from #TaxCutsandJobsAct to make individual income tax cuts permanent, eliminate the death tax, and more. A worthy goal for 2018.
Looking forward to debate on #2018FarmBill, which contains strong work requirements for receiving food stamps. This is the right – and humane – approach to encourage work and lessen govt dependence.
Missouri exports half-a-billion $$$ in products to Japan, including large amounts of ag products. Glad to see President Trump hosting Japanese PM Shinzo Abe last week to talk many topics and strengthen relationship.

Three million new jobs have been created in the US since Donald Trump was elected, and unemployment claims have lowered to levels not seen in 50 years. Those are eye-opening stats.
Doesn’t anybody remember what Adm. Michael Mullen, the Joint Chiefs chairman, said in 2010? “The most significant threat to our national security is our debt.”
Failure to pass Balanced Budget Amendment last week a real lost opportunity to rein in dangerous, out-of-control spending.
Today is Tax Day – Did you pay yours? According to @TaxFoundation, this year Americans will pay $3.4 trillion in federal taxes and $1.8 trillion in state/local. The total tax bill – $5.2 trillion – amounts to 30% of US GDP. Honestly, are we getting our $$$ worth?

“U.S. consumers’ confidence hit a fresh 14-year high this month, as lower-	income households reported feeling more optimistic about the economy.”	Strong action from GOP Congress and President  Trump to slash taxes and regulations a big part of this! https://t.co/jAVQin9P5B
"The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why." … Have always liked this quote from Mark Twain. Gives one a lot to reflect upon this Sunday.
Happy St. Patrick's Day! One of my favorite traditions is participating in Rolla's annual parade. We had an incredible team of volunteers join us - thanks for the support! https://t.co/cUWue2zCED
Happy St. Patrick Day to all! Here's a good read about General Washington lifting his troops' spirits during the brutal 1779-80 winter in Morristown, NJ, by celebrating this relatively unknown holiday. https://t.co/Urrwim576g
@realDonaldTrump recently said: "We want our cities to be sanctuaries for Americans, not safe havens for criminals." Amen. I can't understand why liberals want it the other way around.
"If you know how to shoot, and are quite ready to shoot, the chances are that you won't have to shoot" - Smart advice from Gen. Black Jack Pershing, WWI hero and a MO favorite son. Thank goodness Pres. Trump and Sec. Mattis understand need for military readiness.
Josh Hawley is the FIRST Senate candidate to get @realDonaldTrump support this year … that says something very positive about @HawleyMO and the kind of Senator he will be for Missouri! #HawleyforSenate #MOSen
Good luck to Coach @CuonzoMartin and @MizzouHoops tonight against Florida State in the #NCCATournament! All eyes will be on Nashville as we finally see what the Tigers can do with a healthy Michael Porter!
Proud to get behind Josh Hawley in run for the U.S. Senate. He’s the conservative we need. Looking forward to serving with @HawleyMo on Capitol Hill to help move @realDonaldTrump agenda forward. #HawleyforSenate #MOSen
One message from yesterday’s forum on taxes came through Loud and Clear: A tax code that is simpler and fairer, and tax rates that are lower, are making a world of difference in the lives of Missourians. #TaxCutsandJobsAct
Honored to appear with @realDonaldTrump at event supporting @HawleyMO for Senate. We need Josh Hawley in Washington to help drive conservative agenda. With Supreme Court picks potentially in the offing, we need more Senate Rs! #HawleyforSenate #MOSen https://t.co/q25BZ27YFv
At yesterday’s MO forum on taxes, was pumped to see people’s enthusiasm for #TaxCutsandJobsAct provisions doubling the standard exemption and expanding the Child Tax Credit. These pro-family measures will benefit SE Missouri residents.
March Madness may begin today for college basketball (Go Mizzou!) but here's a reminder that true madness reigns every day in crazy California - and not in a good way. https://t.co/FKbmLY2n2i
Why is it so hard for liberals to agree that if we have laws on the books regarding securing our borders, we should enforce them?
"For God and Country" for nearly a century … Happy Birthday to the American Legion, formed 99 years ago today! Wartime veterans - including 44,000 throughout Missouri - have had no better friend than this great organization.
Guaranteed to make your blood boil: More than 20,000 people on Medicaid waiting lists have died since ObamaCare was enacted, according to a new study. Another reason - actually 20,000 reasons - why we have got to fix the ObamaCare disaster. https://t.co/BjgSAakUT4
I thought it was the job of news organizations to, you know, report the news. Guess CNN doesn't think that applies to them when it's good news about @realDonaldTrump's handling of the economy. https://t.co/i65hDdmRof
#TaxCutsandJobsAct by the numbers: 	- A more than $30 billion income boost for Americans	- 4 million get special bonuses	- 80 million seeing utility bills cut	- Avg family of four saves $2,059	- More than 9 in 10 see more money in their paychecks
Big victory last week for tens of thousands of SE Mo residents who heat homes with wood burning stoves - House passed my bill to delay costly Obama regulations for these stoves. Once Senate also passes, will work with Trump administration for full repeal. https://t.co/ddvkpON6NE
Why secure our borders? This harrowing account of MS-13 members terrorizing U.S. schools - six murders in two years at one NY institution alone - makes the case for increased border control ASAP. https://t.co/z1aztuElE1
Hiring surge added 313K jobs in February" (ABC News) … "Economy is Looking Awfully Strong" (NY Times) … "Jobs Report Shows a Labor Market Right in the Sweet Spot" (The Hill) … "Recovery isn't Slowing Down" (Wash. Post)		I sure enjoyed reading headlines like these last week!
Our hearts go out to the family of Clinton, MO, police officer Ryan Morton, laid to rest today after losing his life last week in the line of duty. A military veteran and MO National Guardsman, he was a true hero devoted to protecting lives and keeping the peace.
Start your week off with a smile - here's a running list of all employee pay raises, bonuses, utility rate cuts, or benefit hikes thanks to #TaxCutsandJobsAct. With govt. now taking less $, everyone is keeping more of what they make!
Just how good was Trump economy in 2017? GDP was substantially higher than in 2016, unemployment rate fell to lowest level since 2000, and economy added 2.2 million nonfarm jobs. Can’t wait to see the jolt that #taxreform and regulatory rollback provide!
Americans certainly understand how #TaxReform is poised to further strengthen the American economy. Confidence is a great sign of U.S. economic well-being. https://t.co/tCCN51AQu5
Amen. Marc Thiessen is spot-on about benefits of #TaxReform https://t.co/1oZLKJxuJM

“New research shows that spending cuts are superior to tax hikes when it comes to reducing the deficit.” Glad to see confirmation of what most conservatives already suspect. https://t.co/0aMSkxBclX

How’s this for some good economic news? U.S. jobless claims – that is, the number of people filing for unemployment – are at the lowest levels in 49 years. That’s a good sign of a strong labor market. https://t.co/tGcXzYjqgv
True to this day: “We don’t have a trillion-dollar debt because we haven’t taxed enough; we have a trillion-dollar debt because we spend too much.” — Ronald Reagan

A little ironic that March 4-10 is “Severe Weather Awareness Week” given the devastation that tore through southern Missouri a week earlier … Still, good tips here to prepare for and deal with dangerous storms. https://t.co/F1p8f2OSqo
Remember the Alamo! Travis, Crockett, Bowie, and the other defenders who gave their lives OTD in 1836 were true Texan – and American – heroes.

Really impressed by the spirit of the communities rallying to help those who suffered in last week’s storms. When the worst hits, the best of Missouri comes out on display. https://t.co/IuQCM8yWan
Just how insane is the Left’s dedication to protection illegal immigration? “Oakland last year withdrew any cooperation with ICE even on investigations of sex-slavery and drug-smuggling.” https://t.co/8bzakmTA9Q
What an outrage that an American elected official would work to undermine federal authorities from enforcing duly passed laws of the United States. Dems’ obsession with sanctuary cities jeopardizes safety and undermines the Constitution. https://t.co/EB4fXW4HWC
A seminal day in Missouri – and world – history. It was on March 5, 1946 that Winston Churchill spoke at Westminster College in Fulton, MO, of the “Iron Curtain” falling across Eastern Europe.

Great close out to a successful #FFAWeek 2018! For 90 years the Future Farmers of America hasn't just taught skills for the farm, it has taught leadership and instilled values.
“No veteran deserves to be treated with disrespect while visiting a memorial dedicated to the memory of the men and women who gave their lives for our country.” Amen to that. https://t.co/gBa9PmTHQw

Here’s an Olympic memory: The Miracle on Ice occurred OTD in 1980 at the Lake Placid games. While I wouldn’t be born for four more months, I recall my parents talking about what a great moment it was for the entire country.

Nancy Pelosi set a record for what the media is calling her “marathon” speech in favor if illegal immigration … So why do I feel like I’m the one who just ran a marathon?
Proud to have voted for the biggest pay raise for our military in 8 years. Our men and women in uniform certainly deserve it.
Nancy Pelosi’s impassioned 8-hour speech in favor of illegal immigration – she even said we should thank those who break our immigration laws – helps explain why she is the House MINORITY Leader.
So Nancy Pelosi thanked illegal aliens for sneaking their children into the U.S. in contravention of U.S. law. Is that really something we should be thanking them for?
“Protecting criminal aliens from federal immigration authorities defies common sense and undermines the rule of law”  ~ Atty General Jeff Sessions https://t.co/Pvge1EWEhC
It might have been the longest speech in congressional history, when Nancy Pelosi spoke for 8 hours in favor of illegal immigration on Wednesday. It’s a contender for another record as well: Most ridiculous speech given in the U.S. House history.
Of her 8-hour ‘filibuster,’ Nancy Pelosi said: “When you’re out there talking, it seems shorter. When you’re listening, it seems longer." Trust me, Nancy, when I tell you: It seemed even longer to the rest of us than you realize.
Another amazing set of numbers: 35-1 … At time of @realDonaldTrump’s inauguration one year ago, ISIS had more than 35,000 fighters. Today it has less than 1,000. Shows what resolve in fighting terror can do.
Here’s a ratio that will blow you away: 22:1 … That’s the rate at which we repealed federal regulations over the last year. Think about that – 22 costly, useless, or overly onerous regs withdrawn for every one added. Helps explain strong US economy.
Congrats to State Representative-Elect Chris Dinkins, whose hard work and well-fought campaign has led her to victory in the 144th District! I’m pleased to have Chris joining myself and President Trump in our fight to keep taxes low and eliminate burdensome government regulations

“The job market juggernaut marches on” according to Moody’s chief economist Mark Zandi. Private payrolls jumped 234,000 in January, far exceeding analysts’ expectations of 185,000. That’s a strong start to the year for job creation.
Now that Americans are seeing bigger paychecks thanks to historic tax reform, let’s not forget what Nancy Pelosi calls that extra money that is making a difference in peoples’ lives: “crumbs” https://t.co/KNH5vM4FR0
Here’s a headline for you: America gets a raise: Wage growth fastest since 2009 https://t.co/uIi4k2YRFS via @CNNMoney

Big takeaway from #SOTU last week is that the president’s ambitious agenda is not a partisan one, but one for ALL Americans – not Republican and not Democrat, but America First.

Was proud to sit in House chamber for @realDonaldTrump’s historic #SOTU last night. He laid out a vision for bolder, stronger, safer, more prosperous United States. Truly Making America Great Again.
@realDonaldTrump voiced full support for America’s armed forces in last night’s #SOTU. Good to once again have a president who understands the important of American military might.
“No people on Earth are so fearless, or daring, or determined as Americans.  If there is a mountain, we climb it.  If there is a frontier, we cross it.  If there is a challenge, we tame it.  If there is an opportunity, we seize it.” #SOTU
Inspirational #SOTU: “It is not enough to come together only in times of tragedy.  Tonight, I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people we were elected to serve.”
Great economic numbers in #SOTU: 2.4 million new jobs created since election, including 200,000 in manufacturing … Unemployment claims at 45-year low … stock market gained $8 trillion … And tax cuts/reg reform will make economy even stronger.
“This is our new American moment.  There has never been a better time to start living the American Dream.” #SOTU
R/t if you agree with @realDonaldTrump “The state of our Union is strong because our people are strong. And together, we are building a safe, strong, and proud America.” #SOTU
The House passed bill funding our men and women in uniform at levels recommended by military leaders – something Senate Liberals consistently blocked last year. Hopefully they learned from their shutdown debacle that the American people support our troops. https://t.co/sGV9llQRgx
Energized by last night’s #SOTU. President Trump was bold, optimistic, and statesmanlike – the leadership our country needs.
@realDonaldTrump SOTU particularly timely with economic benefits of tax reform now starting to be seen – with many employers announcing bonuses and wage increases, not to mention people’s take-home pay getting bigger
Glad to see all the stories about how effects of the recent historic tax cuts are already showing up in people’s paychecks!
America’s last great battleship, the USS Missouri, was launched OTD in NYC in 1944. History was made on its decks as Japan surrendered to end WWII. Now a museum at Pearl Harbor alongside the USS Arizona.

Now *this* is a headline worth sharing: https://t.co/MKpULIKSLl
Here’s what the #SchumerShutdown means for U.S. military personnel – they won’t get paid until situation gets resolved. And for what? So that Congressional Dems can protect illegal immigration. It’s unconscionable.
Congressional Dems making one thing clear – protecting illegal immigration is more important to them than paying our men and women in uniform, funding the basic functions of govt, and supporting critical public health and security initiatives. #SchumerShutdown
Govt shutdown reveals the Left’s insane absolutism on illegal immigration. They are holding government hostage. #SchumerShutdown
Democrats hate President Trump so much that they shut down the government a year after he took office. Tell the Democrats to put the country before their big egos and do their job!
President Trump sworn in one year ago today. And in one year we are safer, more secure, and more prosperous. We gave military members a much-needed raise, begun focusing on border security, and passed historic tax reform plan. Looking forward to what this year brings!

Some unfinished business from tax reform: Congress needs to *permanently* kill Obama’s medical device tax. It punishes anyone who uses pacemakers and other devices that help people recover from illness or injury.
31 years ago this week the Dow closed above 2,000 for the very first time. Last week it crossed 25,000 – including a 36 percent jump since the Trump 2016 election. #TaxReform and cutting regulations to help keep economy humming in 2018 and beyond.
Today the House is voting on a resolution of support for the people of #Iran standing up to the despots that rule the country. I am proud to stand up for those seeking freedom around the world.

We’ll see what #TaxReform conference brings, but Senate tax bill does contain a few really attractive provisions – notably it opens portion of ANWR for energy development, thwarting Leftist environmental lobby … and would end ObamaCare individual mandate… I can live with these!
The best evidence #TaxReform is a good idea? See the epic celebrity meltdown after the Senate passed its bill Saturday morning. Good roundup of out-of-touch Hollywood insanity here https://t.co/54Pa5gvjLy
We’re one step closer to #TaxCuts with Senate passage this week – big hurdle overcome. We’ll reconcile House and Senate bills to get across the finish line and mark a huge win for the American people and US economy.

Happy Birthday to one of the Show-Me State’s favorite sons – the great Mark Twain born OTD in 1835 (as Samuel Clemens) in Florida, Missouri.
Very proud that President Trump once again has come to Missouri to make the case for #TaxCuts. Our tax plan will increase heartlanders’ take-home pay, create jobs, and spur real economic growth.

Sanctuary cities are an insult to the rule of law. https://t.co/Dki4m1ftdn

America signs Congress' paychecks. If our nation doesn't deserve top priority, then elected officials don't deserve a paycheck. https://t.co/ciNWZi6bpU
You can either support sanctuary cities, or you can support putting America First. You cannot support both. https://t.co/2NybuMVfY8
Too many elected officials seem to have forgotten who works for whom. We serve the American people, NOT the other way around. https://t.co/NX7iYTpi4v
Any politician who supports sanctuary cities is prioritizing political correctness over safety. https://t.co/gIiyTF0QoN
It’s simple: unelected D.C. bureaucrats should stay off the backs of Missouri’s farmers and small business owners. Period. https://t.co/jgIMfyPuJB

The House of Representatives passed a bill I wrote called the SCRUB Act. This will help Trump cut two regulations for any new one authored. https://t.co/KtlLtrliUW
You can either support sanctuary cities, or you can support putting America first. You cannot support both. https://t.co/qkaaw3dQkn
Let me be clear: these policies place a greater value on political correctness than protecting the safety of American citizens. https://t.co/KCnvGc4EZ3
Trump promised to shake things up in Washington. So far, he’s doing exactly that. Special interests are furious and I couldn’t be happier. https://t.co/uH6UBxTm4c
