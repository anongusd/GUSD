Then he says to my mom “Pat, will you turn this light off above my bed?” She did and he laid back and said “well you guys drive safe!” I was like “welp!! Guess that’s our cue to hit the road! See ya tomorrow dad!!” 😂😂
He also told us he worried about my mom driving the “dangerous” road home alone at night (its not dangerous 😂). My sister’s like “I drive the same road. You’re not worried about me?” My dad says “husbands are supposed to worry about their wives. You need to find a man.” 😂😂

@jennh_ @OklaStina 😂😂😂
@jennh_ @OklaStina It was hella bad. And uncomfortable as you can imagine. And they determined I did NOT have the torn flap thing, so it was all for naught. 😬😬😬 Just acid reflux.
@jennh_ @OklaStina Girl, the test for a torn flap was weird. I had to keep a tiny plastic tube down my nose, into my throat for 24 hours &amp; had to wear a weird machine pack around my neck. Every time I coughed, cleared my throat, etc. had to hit a different button. I felt like I was being punked.

@OklaStina @jennh_ But anyhoo, Dexilant changed my life. Try a prescription strength acid reflux med from an ENT.
@OklaStina @jennh_ So go to an ENT and have them check you out. They were like “so limit foods that are spicy, acidic, fatty, fried and chocolate.” I was like “Uh, that’s my 5 good groups.” 😳😳😳 They may you for a ripped esophageal flap or something. They did me. It was a weird process.
@OklaStina @jennh_ Again, acid reflux isn’t heartburn.... there isn’t tightening of the chest and the acid doesn’t always make it to your mouth. It just splashes up in your throat. And DON’T take the OTC meds constantly. They can be bad for you. Excessive use can cause C. Diff I’ve been told.
@OklaStina @jennh_ The acid reflux (NOT heartburn) was splashing up, only making it to my throat. It causes very frequent throat clearing, post nasal drip, raspy voice. I had to get on RX strength acid reflux meds. I take Dexilant EVERY DAY. If I miss more than a couple of days, it’s a nightmare.
@OklaStina @jennh_ This happened to me too!!! My voice started sounding like Darth Vadar and I just thought it was my allergies but nothing made it go away!! After 3 months I went to an ENT and he stuck a mirror down my throat and said “you have burnt vocal chords.” 😳😳😳

Ppl in positions of power &amp; authority, like Elizabeth Warren, confusing this issue means Indigenous kids can be legally taken from their families. PERIOD.

@jrquinla @QueenMab87 I do believe 100% in redemption, and that's a very good point to turn to next. ❤️ None of us should ever be defined by one action or one deed in our lives, and no one is perfect. I look forward to seeing what she does next.
@jrquinla @QueenMab87 And for the record, if she was the nominee, I’d vote for her. I actually used to be a big fan. But I think there are a lot of other ppl who would never vote for her, not even based on this issue. So those ppl + ppl she’s alienated on this is too much to overcome in my opinion.
@jrquinla @QueenMab87 I don’t think it is amends at all. I just think it’s our best path to decreasing the likelihood Trump gets a 2nd term. I don’t think EW can beat him. I really don’t. So if she helps prevent a 2nd Trump term by getting out, maybe that’s amends, not the act of dropping out itself.

@cstevenhager @eshaLegal @pollysgdaughter — would you agree with that?
@cstevenhager @eshaLegal So while one can dispute accuracy, legitimacy, validity of the Dawes Rolls themselves...  it was Cherokee people during the tribal self-determination era who willingly chose to use that as our base role — not the feds. 4/
@cstevenhager @eshaLegal And speaking of the Dawes Rolls, that’s what Cherokee people in 1975 decided to base citizenship on. In 1975, when our first modern day constitution was passed, those delegates to the constitutional convention could have chosen to use other rolls for citizenship but didn’t. 3/
@cstevenhager @eshaLegal There are actually some descendants from ppl on those earlier rolls who do not qualify for citizenship today, but we know their ancestors were once part of the tribe. But at some point those ancestors (usually) willingly separated from the tribe before the Dawes. 2/
@cstevenhager @eshaLegal But there are probably a dozen, if not dozens, of different rolls that were taken of Cherokees going way, way back. So we don’t have rely an oral history like other tribes. We had a written language from 1821 I think. 1/
@jrquinla @QueenMab87 I dunno.... I feel like the damage is done. I’m exhausted by it. She should just be a really effective senator and not jump into the presidential race after all. We have a lot of great choices. Let’s start trimming candidates, and she has way too much baggage at this point. 😕

@alsosusieq2 @pollysgdaughter @rebeccanagle @MeetThePress @najournalists And that claim is fairly gross.
@alsosusieq2 @pollysgdaughter @rebeccanagle @MeetThePress @najournalists One thing that drives me nuts about EW is the “elopement” claim of her parents (which through research @pollysgdaughter found to be completely false). So she’s not only claiming someone else’s heritage and culture.... but actually claiming her family was harmed in some way by it.
@alsosusieq2 @pollysgdaughter @rebeccanagle @MeetThePress @najournalists And I’m being very sincere, not nasty... it’s not okay to claim that because it’s claiming a history and heritage and a shared experience that one does not possess.
@alsosusieq2 @pollysgdaughter @rebeccanagle @MeetThePress @najournalists Because that’s how you prove Native heritage. Native Americans are among the most well documented ppl in the world because the U.S. govt treated us like cattle. Without citizenship, you’re just repeating EW’s mistakes..

@PegLegSally @AzieDee @Inkfacefahz @NativeApprops I agree, and I used to give EW the benefit of the doubt... but the more that drips out, the more dishonest she is starting to appear.
@AzieDee @PegLegSally @Inkfacefahz @NativeApprops That’s another thing that gets me.... the privilege she showed by just getting to “pick” at different times what she is. And now acting like that’s not a big deal. That’s super bold.
@AzieDee @PegLegSally @Inkfacefahz @NativeApprops EXACTLY. I was born at the Cherokee Nation’s hospital, went to Cherokee Nation Head Start, was in the Cherokee Children’s choir, went to an all-Cherokee school... and even I went back and forth at times between white and AI. So it boggles my mind that she so freely wrote it in.
@AzieDee @PegLegSally @Inkfacefahz @NativeApprops 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
@AzieDee @PegLegSally @Inkfacefahz @NativeApprops Oh wow.... hmmm.... so was it a sentimental motivation? A wanting to know more motivation? Seeing as how they just drip information out so slowly, we may never know. She needs to just sit down and do an interview and be 100% honest... if she can. 😬
@PegLegSally @AzieDee @Inkfacefahz @NativeApprops So it being the 80s... and knowing real Natives who paused at that question.... I have to wonder why she felt the need to check the AI box.
@PegLegSally @AzieDee @Inkfacefahz @NativeApprops When I was a kid, I went to school with all full bloods, so being mixed, I often didn’t feel “as Indian” as my friends. So although I always identified as Cherokee verbally and at home, I didn’t always check the AI box consistently until I got older.
@PegLegSally @AzieDee @Inkfacefahz @NativeApprops I have no idea.... I’m trying to figure out why she did it. That would seem like a reason. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Because I know enrolled citizens (like myself) who have gone back and forth on what box to check. Some actual enrolled citizens don’t feel like they’re “native enough” to do so.
@AzieDee @PegLegSally @Inkfacefahz @NativeApprops Exactly. I would assume that she would have been listed as a minority by the bar, thereby bumping her to the top of the list if someone is looking for minority representation.

@TommSciortino @pollysgdaughter Cherokee ancestry is only verifiable through records. We were the most well documented people in the world.
@JohnneyJ97 Honestly, you have no idea how frequently we are asked to comment on this stuff. It’s exhausting and distracting. Keep in mind we stayed silent on Warren until the DNA test — so she got a 6-7 year free pass to do the right thing. We commented on Trump and Scott Brown long before.
@TommSciortino @pollysgdaughter I think it’s because, until the last 600 years or so, North and South America were completely cut off from the rest of the world for centuries. So there’s been less Co-mingling.
@TommSciortino @pollysgdaughter I grew up being Cherokee my whole life, being around other Cherokees and knowing who my family is/was. And for those who were removed from their tribes in some way, reconnecting is a difficult, humbling process.
@TommSciortino @pollysgdaughter Yes!!! For sure! It’s a fun thing. I did it. But it doesn’t make you “Native” to find certain DNA markers. Being Native isn’t just about accepting your tribe.... it’s also about your tribe accepting you.
@TommSciortino @pollysgdaughter No. It doesn’t distinguish tribe. It lumps all North and South America indigenous peoples together. So from the tip of Chili to Alaska. It doesn’t distinguish. Like, here’s mine. https://t.co/6xN1d8mB3p

@matt_quinlisk @powercreek @enchantedskillz @HeatherBlacket1 @JusticeToAll @AmoneyResists I thought that’s what we were doing. The person I replied to said the school was a monster factory, in the context of it appears they crank out kids that aren’t ready to for a multicultural world. The kids are just a symptom. The school &amp; the Catholic Diocese there are to blame.
@matt_quinlisk @enchantedskillz @powercreek @HeatherBlacket1 @JusticeToAll @AmoneyResists There appears to be a systematic failure to identify and condemn racism at the school. That’s my opinion.
@powercreek @matt_quinlisk @enchantedskillz @HeatherBlacket1 @JusticeToAll @AmoneyResists I’m showing what appears to be a systematic culture of racism at their school that, at best, goes unchecked. At worst, is condoned.

Bottom line is we’ve placed the bar too high for what it means to be a racist. It’s time we lower that bar and put it exactly where it belongs.  6/6 https://t.co/ClrMMRfYq9
Being a racist is flipping out because Congress is starting to look more like America and the people it represents and and less like your gated country club. 5/
Being a racist is becoming furious or clutching your pearls when a woman of color says “we’re gonna impeach the MF’er” while fully supporting an old white racist who bragged openly about sexually assaulting women, yet somehow still managed to go on to be president.  4/
Being a racist is calling the people harassing this man “children” while Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and other young men of color were called “thugs.” 3/
I’m also preparing for said racists to act like being CALLED a racist is as bad as BEING a racist, which they often do. 🙄 Being a racist doesn’t mean using the N word or being in the KKK. It means having such a white privilege viewpoint that ppl can’t see why this was wrong. 2/
So I tried unsuccessfully tonight to explain to a troglodyte why the actions of these d-bags were racist. After my ill-conceived attempt, I decided he was just a racist too. 🤷🏻‍♀️ So from now on, I’m just going to call a racist a racist when I see it.  1/	https://t.co/qKBD871spc

@ILoveCatsMore I know other states are way worse. And to me, Oklahoma is so conservative it doesn’t even make sense to gerrymander. Being from eastern OK, I remember when they screwed CD2. And CD3 is a joke. But just b/c we’re not as bad as other states doesn’t mean it’s not gerrymandered.

Using "Pocahontas" as a slur is not just racist, it's sick. She was a child who was kidnapped, raped, and in all likelihood, murdered. She was the original #MMIW. Read @VinceSchilling's piece then decide how appropriate that epithet is. https://t.co/7whPf2TBqf

@realCOnative @KimTayl45161292 @HeiuanH Sure it does.... collectively. It isn’t about individual women in power. It’s about men making up the entire power structure.
@The_Acumen I have to believe that’s still true....
@The_Acumen I think of my grandpa who was an FDR Democrat &amp; union man. He believed in social security &amp; Medicare... when I was a little girl I asked “Pap-pa, what’s the difference in Democrats &amp; Republicans?” He said “sis, Democrats are for the working man. Republicans are for the rich man.”
@KimTayl45161292 @HeiuanH @realCOnative And btw — I don’t have kids, but even I vaguely know the rules around daycare. This is the problem with men disproportionately in power in this country.
@The_Acumen I’m hoping we can get the Democratic Party there. Easier to build that under an existing structure with similar, albeit not perfect, ideals and priorities. Gotta make the change from within. That’s why I finally decided to get way more involved with the party.

@emilylangok @TU_BLA Yes they are. If they voted for him &amp; are “quietly” apologizing rather than loudly admitting their mistake &amp; doing something about it, they are like him &amp; they are responsible for him. When someone tells you who they are believe them. Trump has always shown us exactly who he is.
@davidalancrow @emilylangok The problem is it’s Rs in politics who helped get him here &amp; are allow him to go unchecked. You need to say “you did this. Your party has been moving in this direction for a long time &amp; pandering to bigots, racists &amp; anti-government kooks finally caught up to you. Congrats.”

That's what Americans need to get back to realizing -- governments exist to serve people &amp; that's it. Period. So when the U.S. government is #shutdown, people aren't being served. And it's mind boggling to me that the richest country in the world isn't serving its citizens. 4/4
If our tribal government were ever to #shutdown, we'd see people go without all those things. And not just "people," but people we know and love and are related to. The @CherokeeNation doesn't exist only to provide jobs. We often say our sole purpose is to serve people. 3/
Working for @CherokeeNation, maybe this is more obvious to me. Every day we go to work we know it's b/c there are Cherokees who need assistance w/ health care, housing, education, vocational training, etc. Working for a tribe, you see up close &amp; personal WHY governments exist. 2/
I hate, hate, hate that government workers aren't being paid during the #shutdown. It's sad, it's despicable and it's embarrassing for the most prosperous country in the world. But aside from workers not being paid, it's being overlooked that governments exist to serve PEOPLE. 1/

@lesnla @josiahmdanieliv @CashM4NI @The_Acumen @Atagahi @d_a_daniel @CherokeeNation No, YOU are missing the point. Native issues are NOT fake issues. Sorry they’re not YOUR issues, but they certainly aren’t “fake” issues. How dare you. I believe the Dem party is a big-tent party, but you are trying to shove Natives out of the tent. Disgraceful.

@lesnla @josiahmdanieliv @CashM4NI @The_Acumen @Atagahi @d_a_daniel @CherokeeNation Agree between tribes? 🤔 So when have Oklahoma, Texas, California &amp; Florida come to agreement on an issue. Each tribe is a sovereign government with their own policies &amp; priorities. You fundamentally misunderstand tribes. I hope you seek out resources in your quest for knowledge.
@rubyeve70 @rebeccanagle @missmyhappybird @ewarren @KimTallBear @jk_rowling @NativeApprops @PepePierce @NickA_Martin @nick_w_estes @jnoisecat To claim “Native blood” is to claim the same heritage and the shared experience of others, which has been refuted by every genealogist. And it confuses the public discourse around what it means to be a tribal person/citizen. So no, it doesn’t count for much.
@lesnla @pollysgdaughter @PaulHRosenberg @SenWarren Lol!!!!! No tribe demanded she take a DNA test because it wouldn’t have meant anything if she did!! 😂😂😂 Being a tribal person is not just, or even at all, about DNA markers. It’s about a shared culture, heritage, history and experience — none of which she possesses.

@NvrRyan Because you seem to assume everyone in the U.S. has health insurance, despite the GOP’s incessant obsession to destroy the ACA. If the GOP doesn’t want ppl to have health insurance, then why would you question why ppl don’t have health insurance? 🤔
It begs the question why @IHSgov funding (a health program) falls under @Interior (an Indian Affairs, parks &amp; rec, land management agency) rather than a health care administering agency like @HHSGov. This may need to be examined.
But veteran health care isn’t in jeopardy from the shut down (thank goodness!!) because the VA is its own agency and is still open. Since @IHSgov is stupidly funded by @Interior (although administered by @HHSGov) when the $$ runs out, IHS services &amp; personnel become uncertain.
@IHSgov is a closed health system — much like the @DeptVetAffairs health system. So for Natives, it is guaranteed by treaty &amp; law the U.S. govt provide health care for Natives, similar to VA providing health care for vets. These two groups were exempt from ACA individual mandate.
To Mr. Insensitive re: why Indian health care is in jeopardy: Natives were expempt from ACA’s individual mandate. Why? Because the U.S. govt’s trust responsibility per treaty &amp; law is to provide health care for Natives under IHS. That obligation not being met under the #shutdown. https://t.co/iRfJJg37WG

@PaulHRosenberg @SenWarren In my fit, I misspelled “walking.” Oops. 🙄
@debshearer1 @PaulHRosenberg @SenWarren She used us as a pawn. Collateral. That’s all we and our voices meant to her. So disappointing.
@debshearer1 @PaulHRosenberg @SenWarren https://t.co/Gm8Lwh5NtE
@PaulHRosenberg @SenWarren Lastly — do I need to retweet this? We were angry at Warren BEFORE Trump. It’s b.s. Natives are only being defined in the context of Trump v. Warren. He’s a pathological liar &amp; inept leader. She has awful judgment &amp; discounted Native voices. Both are true.	https://t.co/h3SXmW0RXO
@PaulHRosenberg @SenWarren Also — everyone who woke up to this issue 6 months ago suddenly wants to write pieces on Native identity and tell Natives how she did or did not claim ours!? The whitesplaining going on around here is rich. Extremely rich.
@PaulHRosenberg @SenWarren As if she/her family had survived some painful period or event. Know what my family survived? Having every belonging seized by the government and white squatters and being told to leave the land we’d been on for thousands of years. And then they survived waking 900 miles.
@PaulHRosenberg @SenWarren I mean, she legit claimed her parents had to elope because her mom was Cherokee. That’s not just claiming our identity but also claiming as tho her family suffered in some way.
@PaulHRosenberg @SenWarren To claim to be Native IS to claim our idendity tho! Non-Natives don’t get it.
RT @JimGray17710373: I may be a bit biased, but this is an excellent summary of just one aspect of who is getting hurt during the current g…
@PaulHRosenberg @SenWarren Email sent.
@PaulHRosenberg @SenWarren ”That was my family lore growing up and I had no reason to doubt it. Now I know that not to be true. As an attorney and a US Senator, I know understand why those claims were wrong. I’m sorry if I harmed tribal interests in any way.” 	And that would have nipped it right there.
@PaulHRosenberg @SenWarren And had she listened to us...... she would have understood that and just let this go. The perfect exit for her 4-6 years ago could have been the following:
@PaulHRosenberg @SenWarren But the grandest slap in the face of all was the DNA test. She ignored native voices at every turn. I don’t care what her DNA test says. To be Native is more than DNA markers. It’s about a shared culture, history, heritage and experience. She shares none of that.
@PaulHRosenberg @SenWarren And that really sucks because I used to really like her. We like her politics. I even gave her the benefit of the doubt on this issue. But the first time she blew it was at the NCAI conference. She wouldn’t back down from being “Native” she just stopped claiming Cherokee.
@PaulHRosenberg @SenWarren I’m glad everyone else just woke up to this, but I have emails w/ media going back on this for six and a half years. This is not a new issue and she had the space and time to do the right thing and she did the wrong thing at every turn.
@PaulHRosenberg @SenWarren No she’s not open to listening. We’ve told her what she needs to do for 6 yrs &amp; she did the exact opposite. If she was open to listening, she would have never taken a DNA test. Bottom line: she cares more about being right &amp; sticking it to Trump than she cares about Natives. -30-
@Gracie_Raw @SenWarren @PaulHRosenberg @Salon I’ve never worked with the gentleman so I can’t speak to his trash-like qualities. But the fact that I did not work with him and he still wrote such a lengthy piece about our tribe.... well, it’s not promising.

@rebeccanagle @PaulHRosenberg @jbendery This ickshi just burns me up. And no, that’s not a typo. It’s the Cherokee word for what you think it means.. 🤬💩
@rebeccanagle @PaulHRosenberg @jbendery There was bad info in an Atlantic several years ago that continues to haunt us today. As recently as last year some blogger/reporter (🙄) reprinted it and when I called them on it they whined “but it’s the Atlantic. It’s a respected outlet.” Yeah, well they make mistakes too.
@rebeccanagle @PaulHRosenberg @jbendery Like, I really don’t understand why anyone would trust the reporting of other people and treat it all like the gospel. I would never put my name on something without being confident of the sourcing and fact checking. So damned sloppy.
@rebeccanagle @PaulHRosenberg @jbendery The real problem with reporting these days is that every reporter borrows from other reporters without doing their own fact checking. That leads to more “fake news” (a term I despise) in legit media more than anything else. Trust me, I’ve dealt with this sloppiness for years. 🙄
Sigh... this dude wrote a heavy critique of media coverage of @SenWarren, even invoking the offensive “fake news” line... then didn’t include correct info! It’s so offensive for this non-Indian to diminish our Sec. of State’s authority in order to justify his support of Warren. https://t.co/fIeTu7Yo43
@rebeccanagle @Debkrol @PaulHRosenberg It does appear on our official online newsroom &amp; never taken down. I spoke with @jbendery &amp; she was going to correct that.

So is a stupid $6B wall worth the lives of people? Yeah, I’m sorry parks are closed and trash is piling up. I’m sorry people are not working (I truly am — they need to put food on the table and pay the light bill). But does anyone understand people could die? B/c they could.

@kymde I appreciate that. 😊 So much!! 💕
@santanalourds @davlaown Here. This will help you follow. 		https://t.co/agusTDvO0M
@kymde Well, she has met with tribes. She’s had since 2012 (and definitely more in recent years). I met EW and her PR person in April last year in DC &amp; her PR gal followed up with an email. I offered guidance then. Lil ole me!! Never heard from her again. 🦗Still did the wrong thing. 😕
@kymde I even minimized it when I spoke to the Boston Globe, Washington Post.. like “yeah, a lot of people here have that story, so it doesn’t raise a lot of eyebrows here.” So she had the time and space. Then she proceeded to double down and I was just DONE. 😬😬 2/2
@kymde If she could have just done ONE right thing at any point, I wouldn’t be so done with her. But we gave her the space for SIX years to just do the right thing. 😕 Because I honestly chalked it up first to just being an okie and everyone thinking that here. 1/2
@historic_ly @LongDaysJourne1 USDA food shipments to tribes for food pantries are about to be in jeopardy, and Indian Health Service, the only health care for many Natives, is also in jeopardy if the shutdown doesn’t end soon. 😔
@kymde So sadly, I think she can’t fix it because she’s hung it around her own neck so tightly and she’s one of the most arrogant politicians I’ve witnessed. And she has no one to blame but herself. And I hate it because I liked her and she was from Oklahoma. But alas...😕 7/7
@kymde That’s when I decided I was over and done with her. We’d counseled, given the benefit of the doubt, reached out.... I even met and then emailed with her communications director last April. And she still did the wrong thing. Everyone blew up one that DNA test. 6/
@kymde But the DNA test came after her being counseled again &amp; again on what to do.... that’s when everyone collectively lost their icksh. And according to insiders, she was shocked by the backlash, which blows my mind. Native groups had been on her for 6 yrs about why she was wrong. 5/
@kymde “.... I don’t claim to be a citizen of any tribe.” So she still doubled down. That’s when I first started to get REALLY frustrated with her. Because she had been counseled better than that. That was arrogance and ego. 4/
@kymde THEN, she was going to redeem herself and spoke at the @NCAI1944 conference, the largest gathering of Natives each year. There, she just stopped claiming to be Cherokee. She said in a speech “I respect tribes’ sovereignty in determining their own citizenship.... 3/
@kymde “But now, as an atty and US senator who knows more about Indian issues, I understand how it could be harmful and I apologize.” But she refused to do that, she just dodged it. 2/
@kymde Sigh...at one point, yes. But now? No. She blew every opportunity to do the right thing at every turn. 😕 She could have backed off years ago when tribes were asking her to &amp; just said “hey, like many Oklahoma families, mine was misinformed, but I had no reason to doubt it.” 1/

@billykeene22 @steveinmerida And that’s not her. We have no idea where her ancestors may have originated. Those tests (I’ve taken one) lump East Asian with Native heritage. This is the problem with her claims. Citizenship and BQ comes up, when DNA has nothing to do with tribal citizenship.

@steveinmerida @billykeene22 No. No they didn't. I'm Cherokee. I know my ancestors back to the 1600s. We're the most well-documented people in the world.

@josiahmdanieliv @CashM4NI @The_Acumen @Atagahi @d_a_daniel I think she doesn't care.... or care enough.... about Indians. And I addressed Freedmen descendants in that thread.
@The_Acumen @CashM4NI @Atagahi @d_a_daniel @josiahmdanieliv She and he are not totally different in their personalities. That's what troubles me.
@CashM4NI @The_Acumen @Atagahi @d_a_daniel @josiahmdanieliv It means to be a citizen of a tribe, or part of a tribal community. Please read that link I sent. It was prepared by three respected Native scholars and activists. Wado! 5/5
@CashM4NI @The_Acumen @Atagahi @d_a_daniel @josiahmdanieliv The most important direction was to say "As an attorney and a senator, I know understand why those claims are harmful. I apologize if I harmed tribal interests along the way." By claiming to have Native heritage with no proof (DNA is not proof), it muddies the waters on what 4/
@CashM4NI @The_Acumen @Atagahi @d_a_daniel @josiahmdanieliv And some will say "well she never claimed citizenship." That's true but you know where she came up with that line? From tribes trying to help her out and guide her in the right direction. She took part of the direction, but not the most important part. 3/
@CashM4NI @The_Acumen @Atagahi @d_a_daniel @josiahmdanieliv And in the Cherokee Nation, we have tribal citizens who aren't any Indian at all! They are descendants of slaves once held by Cherokees. Doesn't matter if they took a DNA test and it said 100%, 25% or .00000001% or Zero%. They are citizens nonetheless. 2/
@CashM4NI @The_Acumen @Atagahi @d_a_daniel @josiahmdanieliv Regarding the 1% thing also... I can't be 1% Cherokee anymore than I can be 1% and American. Citizenship is different in every tribe. In the Cherokee Nation, it's based on an ancestor on the Dawes Rolls. Other tribes have their own rules around citizenship. 1/
@CashM4NI @The_Acumen @Atagahi @d_a_daniel @josiahmdanieliv I will say this till the day I die... Warren cares more about sticking it to Trump more than she cares about an entire population of marginalized people. She knew better, she was asked to let it go &amp; apologize. Her arrogance &amp; ego &amp; lack of respect for tribes wouldn't let her.
@CashM4NI @The_Acumen @Atagahi @d_a_daniel @josiahmdanieliv She's not 1% Cherokee or any other tribe. Let's get that straight. But for me, it shows a critical lack of judgment She was in contact w/ Cherokee Nation &amp; other tribes who wanted her to apologize. She ignored them &amp; instead took a DNA test, the opposite of what they asked.

@CashM4NI @The_Acumen @Atagahi @d_a_daniel @josiahmdanieliv You said it wasn’t a valid concern. Maybe to you it’s not. But to hundreds of thousands of Natives, it is. How would you feel if she claimed to be Black? As if her ancestors shared the same experience as yours, when in fact, hers were most likely colonizers and slave owners?
@The_Acumen @CashM4NI @Atagahi @d_a_daniel @josiahmdanieliv Exactly. “Get over your hundreds of years of genocide and maltreatment” isn’t any easier than getting over slavery or other amoral federal policies enacted to dominate people of color.

@billykeene22 True. But she won’t even make it that far. A Warren v. Trump matchup would look like this. 👇🏼	I can’t imagine the Democratic Party is going to let it get there. So she might as well end her pursuit of an office she should have pursued in 2016 sooner rather than later. https://t.co/WrmJQezeCT
@billykeene22 @rebeccanagle That’s her choice on which hill she dies on. But you can’t deny her points, along with Dr. Adrienne Keene (@NativeApprops) and others, are well-researched, well-sourced and insightful.
@billykeene22 She’s culpable for spitting into a tube so she can pretend for her uninformed “progressive” supporters that her ancestors had a shared experience with mine, when in fact, they did not.
@billykeene22 @rebeccanagle So trust me on this. I know what I’m talking about. 🙄 Her supporters are as blind and rabid as his are.
@billykeene22 Because I haven’t come across one yet. Go through mine and many others’ replies to many of @rebeccanagle’s very valid points. Although anecdotal, very overwhelming evidence of my point. Also — working for Cherokee Nation, I get way more feedback and replies than you do on this.
@Airmit106 @hannahtraining @rebeccanagle @kathryn_tapper @apihtawikosisan No it doesn’t. She should have run in 2016. Her time has passed. A Trump v. Warren 2020 matchup would be a sh*tshow of epic proportions. There are plenty of other progressive candidates that will run. Hard pass on her. I doubt she makes it passed Iowa.
Why can’t Elizabeth Warren supporters understand her offensive DNA stunt has zero to do with Trump &amp; everything to do with her poor judgement &amp; lack of understanding about tribes. Oh wait — b/c in their minds, and hers, Natives are only relevant in the context of Trump. 🤦🏻‍♀️ SMH.

@fakestuffedtigr So if your ancestors were “intermarried Whites,” you actually do have a legitimate claim to citizenship. But I see how that very specific, very rare situation could be confusing. HOWEVER — I’ve made my thoughts on Elizabeth Warren very clear in other tweets you can read. 1/2

Horrible take @rkuttnerwrites. 	“It’s time for Democrats to put away the DNA story.“ What if Natives aren’t ready to put it away? The controversy isn’t “grossly overblown” when you write about Natives as if we’re invisible &amp; our voices aren’t present https://t.co/RUHSM260Qb

@hannahtraining @Airmit106 @rebeccanagle @kathryn_tapper @apihtawikosisan Someone once told me white people in America don’t have their own culture, but they desperately want one, so many of them cling to ours. I suppose because it helps them come to grips w/ their role their ancestors played in our ancestors’ colonization?? 🤷🏻‍♀️
@Airmit106 @hannahtraining @rebeccanagle @kathryn_tapper @apihtawikosisan I only asked if you were Native as well.. also, read some of @rebeccanagle’s other tweets which explain exactly why EW is wrong.
@Airmit106 @hannahtraining @rebeccanagle @kathryn_tapper @apihtawikosisan You count them as “your elders” but you don’t even know what tribe?

@Airmit106 @hannahtraining @rebeccanagle @kathryn_tapper @apihtawikosisan You count some Natives as your elders? I’m confused... are you native? What tribe are they? If you’re not the same tribe, they’re not “your” elders, as you are not part of their community... this is a confusing response....
@Airmit106 @rebeccanagle @kathryn_tapper @apihtawikosisan Her supporters seem blind to her very obvious flaws and lack of sound judgement when Natives were telling her how to handle this for the last SIX years. But yet, she did the exact opposite. Her judgement is horrible.
@wingedeyelinerb @B4Awol @kathryn_tapper @rebeccanagle @apihtawikosisan “She cares more about sticking it to Trump more than she cares about Indians” is my favorite way to describe this, her in general, and more specifically, her poor judgement in reading an issue.

@saveelati I’m not defending anyone. Just trying to make sure my @‘s remain peaceful this last day of 2018. 🙏🏼
@saveelati I already told her well meaning white people have been inflicting harm on communities of color since the beginning of time.
@saveelati But she was literally referring to things she felt/thought as a child in the 1950s. That’s why I asked to just read the whole thing in context. She came to understand why some of her beliefs were well meaning, but wrong, as a child.
@saveelati @Rockin2012Robin @rebeccanagle I think it was in response to the longer thread between us. Just hope it’s read in context, that’s all. 😊
@missmyhappybird @Rockin2012Robin @rebeccanagle That’s the other thing.... her ancestors could have been from anywhere in North or South America. IF it continues to hold up. The algorithms get refined &amp; the % changes. For example, I had trace amounts of “Oceanic” in my 23&amp;Me, and after an algorithm adjustment, that went away.
@saveelati @Rockin2012Robin @rebeccanagle She asked sincere questions and just wanted to learn. She’s learned a lot on this today, and shouldn’t be attacked for genuinely seeking information.
@kathryn_tapper @rebeccanagle @apihtawikosisan They’re both wrong. That’s a possible thing. No one is excusing Trump. He’s a wretched human. But this is about people blindly following Warren like they blindly follow Trump. It’s troubling.

I can’t tell you how my phone and email blow up every time he calls her Pocahontas. I mean, Trump is personally harming me over all this. 🤦🏻‍♀️So I have very personal grievance with the man. 😬
@eshaLegal @SilverAndDark @Rockin2012Robin It was probably someone in my office. 😊 We actually have these on standby because there are sooooo many requests on this topic on the reg. I bet it was a woman named LeeAnn who sent it. Lol...
@Rockin2012Robin @rebeccanagle Absolutely. I took a 23&amp;Me test and it was cool to see where I had Portuguese, Danish and Italian ancestors, but I would never CLAIM to be any of those things. I’m a Cherokee Nation citizen &amp; citizen of the U.S. We’re the only Americans born w/ automatic dual citizenship.
@eshaLegal @SilverAndDark @Rockin2012Robin Well we don’t have a president, we have a chief.... (I’m the Cherokee Nation Communications Director so I’ve fielded requests on this for years)	But yes, she never consulted w/ the tribe, even tho she had direct contact. Heck, even I’ve met her and her communications director! 🤷🏻‍♀️
@Rockin2012Robin @pderevere @SilverAndDark I appreciate that! Thank you! Your sincerity in wanting to learn was obvious to me. 😊
@Rockin2012Robin @rebeccanagle Also — it should be noted that she was in touch with the Cherokee Nation over the years and NEVER asked for advice or guidance on how to handle this. The bottom line is she cares more about being right and sticking it to Trump more than she cares about Indians. Period.
@Rockin2012Robin @rebeccanagle Well meaning white people have been inflicting harm on communities of color since the beginning of time.
@Rockin2012Robin @rebeccanagle Sorry. That was more than 2-3 tweets. 😬😬😬 Bottom line is #TrustTheIndians on this one.
@Rockin2012Robin @rebeccanagle And made fun of since her claims became an issue. One of my issues with Indian mascots is more about the vulgar, hateful things they inspire their opponents to say. She’s brought on the exact same thing, when she could have apologized and put it to bed years ago. 7/7
@Rockin2012Robin @rebeccanagle You can’t be 3% Cherokee anymore than you can be 3% American. Elizabeth Warren, as someone of her stature, has helped muddy the waters on what that means. And the DNA test is what pushed us over the edge on her. And lastly, I’ll say that Indians have been farm more ridiculed 6/
@Rockin2012Robin @rebeccanagle To a non-indian family, against the wishes of her Cherokee father, in part because she was “only 3% Indian.” (Thx Clarence Thomas!) They completely ignored that that child was a tribal citizen, no matter what “percentage” she was. 5/
@Rockin2012Robin @rebeccanagle High profile as Sen. Warren don’t grasp how her claims confuse what that means, that’s a big problem. It muddied the water when we have SCOTUS cases that are very important to our people and to our tribal sovereignty. In 2013 SCOTUS ruled a Cherokee child could be adopted out 4/
@Rockin2012Robin @rebeccanagle We are lucky that any tribes still survive in that manner today. We are thriving governments who serve people and who do everything the federal government does, besides print money and raise an army. We’re not descendancy groups. We’re a functioning government. When ppl as 3/

We were separate &amp; distinct political bodies before Europeans ever stepped foot here. 2/
@Rockin2012Robin @rebeccanagle Give me 2-3 tweets on this... 	it’s already hard for non-Indians to wrap their heads around what it means to be a citizen of separate, indigenous nation inside a nation. They tend to think of tribes as groups people of the same race, rather than separate &amp; distinct nations, 1/
@Rockin2012Robin @rebeccanagle Of course there wasn’t. Indians are the most well-documented people in the world. But she is an attorney &amp; US Senator. All Cherokee Nation wanted her to do is say “Now that I know more, I understand why my claims were harmful, and I apologize.” She could have done that 6 yrs ago.
@Rockin2012Robin @rebeccanagle So many “progressives” who lost their icksh at us. They actually said things like “well I was always for the Indians until this!” 😱 As long as Indians stayed in the neat little box blindly following Warren supporters want us in, they’re with us. But as soon as we stepped out....
@Rockin2012Robin @rebeccanagle But when Cherokee Nation spoke out against her inappropriate actions (after asking her for years to stop it), WE were accused of being Trump supporters. 🙄 Warren supporters follow her blindly just like Trump’s base does. It was eye opening.

@UrbanizedOkie @ULIoklahoma I would think that conservatives who espouse free market principals would be encouraging of immigration. The more I look at it, it just seems racist not to, since the economic argument favors it for the current conditions in this country. 😬
@UrbanizedOkie @ULIoklahoma I’m at the hospital with my dad right now and he’s finally resting, but I can’t wait to watch this later! 😄 But the immigration system (in my humble opinion) is broken because it’s too HARD to become a citizen. Years and years and lots of money and attorneys in many cases.
@ufc @JonnyBones @AlexTheMauler Why is this dude still fighting, given how he can’t stay clean? 🤔 Does he bring that much money in for UFC?
@UrbanizedOkie @ULIoklahoma My company is having a really hard time filling jobs right now. A low unemployment rate IS a good thing — in moderation like everything else. They say 4% is full employment, so much below that — like we have right now — is actually too low.
@TUDrew @DGoforth918 Get the Oklahoman in Tulsa?
@UrbanizedOkie @ULIoklahoma Oh yeah... You’re exactly right. Japan is the perfect example of what happens in a highly industrialized nation when a labor force gets older &amp; retires &amp; there aren’t enough young or NEW people in the labor market to take those jobs. Japan has had this problem for many years now.

@downesphoto @briOKC You don’t need fewer classrooms or fewer teachers. So if 500+ school districts exist &amp; that’s down from 6,000, that’s a pretty good reduction. If schools &amp; school districts aren’t needed anymore (I’m thinking western Oklahoma), they’ll naturalaly close from lack of enrollment.
@downesphoto @briOKC My coworker lives outside Pryor (the biggest school system in Mayes County) and his 6 year old gets on the bus at 6:50am. School starts at like 8:15? That’s crazy to me. And even if you consolidated admins at the county level, the number of kids is the same.
@downesphoto @briOKC But in a rural state like Oklahoma, school district = school. The current conversations are not about consolidating admin at the county level. They’re about closing schools. And you can look at Arkansas and see how well that’s worked. Bus rides for 2 hours.
@downesphoto @briOKC *other than to say “look how few school districts we have!! 🤷🏻‍♀️ There’s no great argument for consolidation.
@downesphoto @briOKC Well the districts already exist, and it doesn’t really save any meaningful amount of money to reduce them and outcomes aren’t better. Board members aren’t paid, so unless you consolidate the administration (which I’m not totally against a county superintendent) what’s the point?
@briOKC “His neighbors, family &amp; friends all gathered at the local school for their Christmas party, for the ice cream social, for weddings. Any type of community event they would have at the school. Communities lost these gathering places when schools closed.”	Exactly what I described.
@briOKC I mean, how much have we given away in tax breaks and incentives to oil companies? 🙄 I’d argue that and a bigger boondoggle. And this line.....
@briOKC So I just read the whole story (I actually thought you were asking a question 🤦🏻‍♀️). 	I challenge the notion that it would save $27M. But even if it did, what is that in our overall state budget at the expense of kids and communities? I’d argue not worth it.
@tl_cox 🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣👏🏽
@briOKC If anyone can come up with a plan to consolidate for quality, rather than political reasons, I’m happy to hear it. But it doesn’t save $ and at those small schools, every kid plays every sport. We had art AND music AND p.e. I had more opportunities at a K-8 dependent school. 5/5
@briOKC If that school goes away, the kids scatter, which means the parents scatter, which means grandparents aren’t speaking their Native language to their grandkids, which means that community dies and so does the culture. And haven’t Native cultures been assaulted enough? 4/
@briOKC But in the case of small schools in Native communities, it keeps our cultures alive. I went to a K-8, dependent school district in Mayes County, called Kenwood. There was a store, a volunteer fire station and the school. People still spoke/speak Cherokee in that community.. 3/
@briOKC People go to sports games, Christmas programs, it’s where they socialize and keep small towns alive. Closing them doesn’t really save any amount of money.... 2/
@briOKC Well it’s likely a holdover from days when people went to school on a horse... but also because small schools are the lifeblood of small communities. When the schools go, so do the communities because everything revolves around those schools. 1/

Whose phone doesn’t autocorrect “smocking” to “smoking?” 🤔  I’m guessing someone who is illiterate or frequently misspells things... both of which describe our president. 😬🤦🏻‍♀️ https://t.co/V7kzPuuMxI
@rock1040 @60Minutes I don’t even feel like it was a “gotcha” interview, because it’s not like she sprung something unexpected on him. She was just plain rude!! It was very unbecoming.
@trudykirby @EmilyVirginOK Right!!?!? I can’t even imagine what high school would have been like?? 😂😂😳
@KelliBruer I mean..... sounds like every billionaire. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Lol
@KelliBruer I know nothing about the dude, other than he seems eccentric, makes cool cars, likes spaceships and freaked everyone out when he tweeted about taking Tesla private. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Those are legit the only things I know about him. 😂😂
@downesphoto @LesleyRStahl @elonmusk He’s odd for sure. I don’t keep up w/ him, so I don’t really have an opinion. What got me was when she acted like she doubted he had a hard childhood. Maybe that’s something he’s lied about in the past?? But for people like me who don’t follow him, I don’t have any subtext. 🤷🏻‍♀️
@RobynAngel @Wethepeoplehope @braden_rose We’re like the only ones on here. 🤣
@downesphoto @LesleyRStahl @elonmusk But you’ll have to try and catch the episode online!
@downesphoto @LesleyRStahl @elonmusk He really wasn’t though. He was open and very kind to her, especially considering how she treated him. And I don’t have feelings about Elon Musk one way or the other. I do, however, have a lot of respect for Lesley Stahl and was pretty disappointed in her tonight.
@KelliBruer I actually felt bad for the guy!! 😱
@cmgates22 @60Minutes @elonmusk I agree!! She didn’t deserve it, the way she was treating him. Lost cred for Lesley Stahl, in my opinion.
@EmilyVirginOK Me, every time I’m reminded there was no Twitter, Facebook or even many cameras on phones when I was in college. 😰 https://t.co/Vrqh8GwxVT
@downesphoto @LesleyRStahl @elonmusk A few times she straight up laughed in his face. Too bad she didn’t go in on Trump the TWO times she’s interviewed him. I didn’t see her trying to get a truthful answer out of that guy!
@downesphoto @LesleyRStahl @elonmusk See the tweet I wrote right after that... also, she was like “the pot!!!???” 🙄 OH. NO. THE POT.
Not shown is Lesley Stahl asking “did you have a happy childhood?” Musk: “No.” Her: “Are you serious?” He says his dad was emotionally abusive, she gives him an eye-roll &amp; says “So you DIDN’T have a happy childhood.🙄” WTH?!? Did her Tesla spontaneously combust or something!!? 😳 https://t.co/hhBCDbKTgn

@billykeene22 I’ve seen that &amp; said “that’s how we got Trump.” But I get how pissed &amp; hurt they are. This has been going on for too long &amp; she wasn’t ignorant to that. Her not admitting she was wrong is exactly like Hillary Clinton not being able to say she shouldn’t have used a private sever.
@billykeene22 Of course I vote for her then. And I wouldn’t actively campaign against her. But I hope and don’t believe she’ll get that far.
I’ve also heard really troublesome things like “I was always for the Indians before this! How dare you, Cherokee Nation!” 🙄 So they’re for Natives as long as we stay in the predefined box &amp; space they’ve created. Refer back to this when some politician sh*ts all over your group.
And my fellow progressives have been so disappointing on this. It’s not too dissimilar from what Trump does to various groups. It also reinforces the idea Natives aren’t living, being, thriving nations... we’re relics of the past or all gone so it doesn’t matter what we think.
I’ll say this louder for those in the back. 🗣 Elizabeth Warren cares more about being right and sticking it to Trump (which backfired) than she cares about an entire population of people and what we’ve been trying to get her to hear for 6 years.  https://t.co/CVmLmypy5X

@DGoforth918 Just goes to show the extra burden on print. People allow less grace. And of course I love my print reporters! Y’all work really hard, are (mostly) witty across the board 🤣 and although most are super careful, it just takes a few burns to chip away at the cred. 8/8
@DGoforth918 I found out later he’d allegedly been misquoted many years earlier and was accused of being an anti-Semite. After that he felt when he was on video or radio, he couldn’t be misquoted. I’d never met someone who had such a visceral reaction toward print and haven’t since. 7/
@DGoforth918 Funny story actually — I took Bob Eubanks (yes the game show king) around for interviews once when he was hosting an event at Hard Rock. He didn’t mind the press, but he HATED print, and was shockiny rude to a TW reporter.  6/
@DGoforth918 So innocent or not (I believe they are), and no matter how infrequent the errors (they are in my opinion), they happen more than other mediums, and with technology today, I don’t get how that is. And despite the intent, it’s still damaging as you point out. 5/
@DGoforth918 I worked in TV before so as a producer we constantly paraphrased. The only direct “quotes” were SOTS and you can’t really misquote someone then. But from working with all forms of media, I’ve found newspaper makes the most errors. 4/
@DGoforth918 It’s frustrating when you see a reporter scrawling on the old school pad &amp; not recording when it’s a lengthy interview or forum. It’s like giving a server a complicated order and they don’t write it down. In your mind you’re like “oh yeah, they’re not getting that right!” 3/

@shagsss I agree that the urban/rural divide is becoming more stark. BUT — that’s population. Land doesn’t vote. 😊 So that made me feel a little better.

@JonesingToWrite @OpenJusticeOK Awesome!! 🙌🏽
@RobertEvatt Be grateful for the updates! Otherwise your SmartTV becomes a dumb TV. 😔
@JonesingToWrite @OpenJusticeOK Yeah, the article was kind of confusing to me.... I wasn’t sure if it was good news or bad news. Lol... but it’s almost Friday, so most things become more confusing to me the later it gets into the week. 😂😂
@JonesingToWrite And this: "Felony charges dropped 28.4 percent statewide in one year" also seems contradictory to the photo cutline.
@JonesingToWrite I'm confused by the info in this article. Am I having brain block or are these statements contradictory? 	"SQ 780 drastically reversed a 10-year upward trend of felony charges"	"Oklahoma saw a 75 percent increase in fiscal year 2018 in the number of women put into custody"
So maybe this is weird, but I always donate to @Wikipedia at the end of the year. And so should you! That's a ton of info we all get for free! Support free knowledge! #iloveWikipedia https://t.co/x64gwy0qR4
@RobertEvatt I actually had to buy a certain type of flash drive, download the update from Samsung's website, and use the flash drive to update the firmware. Newsflash -- I haven't done it because it's giving me trouble and I just won't dedicate the time to finish it. 😑
@RobertEvatt "It's tough to recommend anyone upgrade TVs every two years — even with the credit you'd get — because TV updates aren't really substantial." -- That is b.s. I had a TV in a spare bedroom I didn't use regularly, so it didn't update regularly... now it won't connect to Internet!
