PUT ON   JESUS CHRIST......
PUT ON  THE NEW  ROBE OF   RIGHTEOUSNESS   FOREVER  ETERNAL LIFE
PUT OFF....THE OLD   CLOTHES OF  SELF-LOVING SELF.....
CHOOSE TODAY  TO   PUT  AWAY  WHAT YOU  ARE ABOUT TO DO....
Adam and Eve were now miserable comforters to each other!
SATAN   STATED,   YOU WILL BE LIKE  GOD........
Satan promised they should be safe
This shows the falsehood of the tempter, and the frauds of his temptations.
Fear   now  has entered  into the  human race......
Instead of  peace  now  they suffer  with fear  hearing God  voice....
No marvel that they became a terror to themselves, and full of confusion.
Visits with humble joy; 	but now he was become a terror to them.
Before they sinned, they would have welcomed God's gracious voice
Yet we are all apt to cover our transgressions as Adam &amp; Eve
we make things  worse.....
Sad to say  we  still  wear  fig-leaves  today....
"Like  aprons of fig-leaves"
And lessen their sins, are vain and frivolous  b 4  a God tht knows all...
The excuses men make to cover  their  Sin...
They have more care to save their credit before men,	 than to obtain their pardon from a loving God.
See here what is commonly the folly of those that have sinned.
Either  of true repentance, 	which ends in glory, 	or that shame and everlasting contempt, 	to which the wicked shall rise at the great day.
Sooner or later it will bring shame  .....
It  makes mischief wherever it gets in, and destroys all comfort.
See her what dishonour and trouble sin is  to  all of us.
WHAT WAS GOD  TO DO?
They saw a loving God provoked, his grace and favour forfeited.
NOW,  LETS  TALK ABOUT   GOD.....
DEEP, DOWN,  DEPRESSION,  YOU   CREATED  IT  YOURSELF...
SIN:  GLOOM,  DOOM,  DESPAIR,  AGONY  ON  YOU-----
LIKE    EVE,   YOU  PICKED IT  AND ATE  IT...........PERIOD
DONT  LIE  AND SAY  YOU  WERE  PUSHED  INTO  IT......NO NO
SIN IS  A  WELL  OF  MISERY  WE  FALL INTO  OF OUR  OWN  DOING
SIN  IS A  FRUIT  THAT  IS  SWEET TO  THE TASTE BUT  POISON  TO THE SOUL
THOSE  OUT THERE  GETN READY TO   COMMIT  ADULTERY  NOW IS THE  TIME TO  NOT EAT
THEN  WE GET   PSALM  51.....
AN  MORE....HE  TOOK HER AS  HIS WIFE......WOWOO......MAN AFTER GOD  HEART &lt;3
THAT WA NOT ENOUGH,,,,HE THEN HAD  HER MAN  KILLED.....MURDERED
PERFECT  EXAMPLE .....DAVID  WHEN HE  COMMITED  ADULTERY WITH  BABSHEBA
GUILT AND  SHAME  BEGINS  TO  HOUSE  THEMSELVES  WITHIN
SIN  BRINGS  A DISCONNECTION FROM GOD   IMMEDIATELY
When too late, Adam and Eve FELT  the     DISCONNECT    FROM  GOD
Sin and ruin. 	Who then can say that Adam's sin had but little harm in it?
He turned aside quickly.
In full strength, not weakened or impaired.
HE  had a freedom of will...
To betray him....
He had no corrupt nature within----
ADAM  WENT FROM  PURITY  TO  CORRUPTION  IN ONE  BITE
KIDS,   QUESTIONS  AUTHORITY.....DID  MOM  REALLY  SAY....OR DAD  DID HE MEAN
WHEN YOUR  CHILD  DISOBEYS  YOUR RULES  IT IS  ADAM &amp; EVE  ALL  OVER  AGAIN
Disobedience to a plain, easy, and express command.
ADAM,   sin was, in one word, disobedience, RoM 5:19
God had bestowed on him, and a desire for what God did not see fit to give him.
Adam plainly showed a contempt ..
and eating of the tree of knowledge, which was forbidden,
of which he was allowed to eat,
In neglecting the tree of life--
5. He did eat.
Peer  pressure  is  the  devil's  tool
Those that have done ill, are willing to draw in others to do the same.
She was not  satisfied  just her  to   disobey  but   wanted to draw  adam  too
4. She gave it also to her husband with her.
It is wisdom to stop the first motions of sin.....to disobey.
or when she took, not to eat: but it ended in that....
Her  free   will  came into play  --
When she looked perhaps she did not intend to take---
She did eat.
But he cannot cast us down, Mt 4:6. 3.
May persuade us to cast ourselves down   below  where  worms  live
Satan may tempt, but he cannot force--
It was her own act and deed.
2. She took.
1. She saw.
Observe the steps of the transgression:	 not steps upward -- BACKWARD
THE DAY  MAN  DESTROYED  HIMSELF  	The Serpent's Deception	‚Ä¶5"For God knows that in the day you eat from it your... https://t.co/e8VKJgSJZg
"Has  God  said  you not to eat....."
" never,  never, never,  question  God."
When   you  say to  yourself.....does God really mean  this......your doomed
He got  eve to  question  God's  word
LIke the serpent  deceived  eve,   he does to day.
is the idea that God has changed ......
and one of the biggest snares
The root of faith is the knowledge of a Person,
but a life of knowing WhoM  makes us "go."
not of intellect and reason,
It is a life of Faith,
but it loves and knows the One Who is leading.
Faith never knows where it is being led
Pray
DON'T  GIVE  THE DEVIL  BUILDING  BLOCKS........
SPIRITUAL PRIDE IS    THE DEVIL'S   WORKSHOP.........IN ALL OF US
LET  JESUS LIFT YOU UP.....
APPROACH  THE  THRONE ROOM  IN   HUMILITY,  MEEKNESS, &amp; BROKENESS
DAY   YOU  WILL  SUFFER DEFEAT
THE DAY  YOU  THINK  YOU'RE GOOD ENOUGH TO STAND BE 4  GOD  IS THE
HE GAVE  SO WE  CAN LIVE
BUT   WHAT JESUS  DID  ON THE CROSS   FOR   US
NOT HOW  GOOD  YOU ARE
GOD  DEALS  WITH  US   ON  THE  FOUNDATION OF   GRACE
HIS  MOTIVATION   IS OUR  PATH  TO   GRACE
CHRIST  INDWELLS   HIMSELF  IN OUR  SPIRITS
MOTIVATION OF THE HEART IS  WHO  JESUS IS...ALL ABOUT
RELIGION IS  EXTERNAL,  AND  JESUS  IS   INTERNAL......
THE SAMARITAN  WOMAN AT THE WELL  KNEW MORE  ABOUT JESUS  THAN   RELIGIOUS FOLK
FAITH,  HOPE &amp;  LOVE.....CHRIST
BEGIN  EACH DAY WITH HOPE .....

When affliction is met with fortitude,
It is used of coinage as we use the word sterling.
so that everything base has been purged out of it.
Dokime (Greek #1382) is used of metal which has been passed through the fire

"Fortitude," Paul goes on, "produces character."
it is the spirit which meets things breast forward and overcomes them.
Hupomone is not the spirit which lies down and lets the floods go over it;
That is hupomone (Greek #5281).
but which actively overcomes the trials and tribulations of life
it means the spirit which does not passively endure
It means the spirit which can overcome the world;
(Greek #5281) which means more than endurance.
The word he uses for fortitude is hupomone .
All that pressure, says Paul, produces fortitude.

LOVE  COSTS  THE  GIVER.....
TRUE   LOVE   GOES WHERE THE ACTION IS.....
REAL  LOVE   DONT  SIT AROUND   JUST   CLAPPING IT HANDS....IT   A  LABOR....
PAUL  CALLS IT .....LABOR OF LOVE
LOVE IS  MY  ULTIMATE   GOAL...
I  ACT ON FAITH   BY   GOD LOVE  THAT   ABIDES IN MY NEW  HEART
FAITH IS THE OUTCOME....OF AN  INTERNAL  SPIRITUAL   DIVINE  REGENERATION  OF  SPIRIT
THE   CHARACTERISTIC   EXPRESSION  OF  FAITH   IS WORKS   IN LOVE
LOVE IS  THE   ENGINE.....OF  FAITH
FAITH   WITHOUT  LOVE IS   JUST  WORKS  OF  SELF.....
FAITH  FINDS  IT   PATH  BY   LOVE
BUT   FAITH WORKING   THROUGH LOVE
FOR IN......CHRIST JESUS....WHO....JESUS.....CIRCUMCISION  NOR  UNCIRCUMCISION   MEANS  NOTHING....
PAUL  SAYS......GALATIANS   5:6
FAITH THAT  DOES NOT ACT   WHEN  CALLED UPON IS   DEAD.......
FAITH IS  EXPRESSED BY  WORKS  OR  ACTIONS   DOING GOD'S  LOVE
HOW IS FAITH EXPRESSED.....IN OUR LIVES.
LETS LOOK  AT FAITH.......
AND....THE STEADFASTNESS  OF  HOPE
THEIR LABOR OF LOVE.....

PAUL  SAYS.......THEY HAVE HOPE....FAITH.....LOVE....
PRESENTS  A PICTURE OF  GOD  PEOPLE
LOOK  @  THE Holy Word  SCRIPTURE...	1 THESSALONIANS   1: 2-4
WITHOUT  JESUS  THEN YOU CAN SAY   YOU  ARE   LIVING  WITHOUT HOPE
JESUS  HIMSELF IS  OUR HOPE
JESUS  ENRICHES  OUR  HOPE
WITH  JESUS  CHRIST  THERE IS NEVER   A HOPELESS   MOMENT
YOUR ENEMY  IS  ALWAYS  PREACHING  TO YOU  HOPELESSNESS
WHERE  THERE IS HOPE  THERE IS   LIFE......
IT IS  LIKE   WATER   TO   A FISH......GIVES  IT LIFE.....
OF LIFE......
HOPE  STEADYS  OUR FAITH DURING THE  TRIALS.........
HOPE IS NOT  AN  OPTION
UNLESS  WE HAVE  HOPE  OUR FAITH WILL   BE  UNBALANCED
HOPE IS  OURS  	HOPE IS  NECESSARY  TO  MAINTAIN  OUR FAITH  AND   LOVE....

‚ÄúFaithful is He who calls you, and He also will bring it to pass‚Äù 	1 Thessalonians 5:24
Bore them to the cross, and discharged our debt in full. Hallelujah!
He took our sins upon Himself.
Although the cost to our Savior was enormous, He willingly paid the price we owed.
Jesus Christ left heaven and all of its glory so He could come to earth to live and die for us .
So God, in His great mercy, sent His Son to rescue us.
No amount of good works, self-sacrifice, or religious devotion will lessen what we owe.
Let the knowledge of His sacrifice on the cross permeate every aspect of your life‚Äîyour thinking, attitude, and choices.
We become children of God and co-heirs with Christ as we‚Äôre changed from debtors to inheritors.
When we receive Jesus Christ as our Savior, His atoning work is credited to our account.
His perfections, His glorious victories and His resurrected life
We are identified with His Person
In Christ we have become victorious
As Christians we are the most blessed people on earth.
