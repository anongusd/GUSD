@CNN Our president supports pedophiles. May God help us all!! Better to have a pedophile than a Democrat. Really??	Trump makes me sick. No integrity, no morals. What a worthless piece of 💩. Time to impeach!!!
@CNN No morals, no integrity, as long as the rich are taken care of. It’s just fine with the president to fill the senate with pedophiles. The GOP makes me sick
@CNN Pedophiles for senate!! Making America great
@realDonaldTrump Killing animals to extinction for a f****** trophy is so horrible. Another horrific idea from a horrible president. You are the worst and need to resign.
