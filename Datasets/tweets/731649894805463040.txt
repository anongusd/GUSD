@KristatheYoung1 @danawhite I disagree. Unfortunately Democrats have done a magnificent job of painting Republicans as racist white people. Its bullcrap and it's about time that it got shoved back down their throats. Calling them token blacks is as racist as it gets. As though they're not free thinkers.
Take that AOC! Im wondering if @danawhite can set up a cage match between these two.  I would pay to see that.  No more twitter wars.  Take that shit to the cage. https://t.co/qTr3Saliah
@AP4Liberty Not if the chamber is empty.  Lol
@TiredGeekDad I agree with you as long as it goes both ways. It's a thin line to tread because as we see now, you have men dominating women sports. In other words,  be careful what you wish for.
@LPNational The right to parent your children absent the states interference.  A fundamental liberty interest.
@JessTurnerCRU Except stupid..	You can't fix stupid.  Lol
@TiredGeekDad Then why not the reverse? You're for a woman imposing herself into a male only competition but not the other way around? That is not equality. It's one or the other.
Socialist Squad, Brain cells or Bust, Goofy Globalist, New Deal Nazis, Heroes of Hypocrisy,  Republicans MVPs, Hold my Beer Peers, Dimwitted Danzels, The Commie Command, "Z" Team, Unqualifed Umpas,  Fragile Rock, .....I'm out...let me get more coffee. https://t.co/4ZW7JSxw75
I've had to contemplate how I feel about this whole men competing as women nonsense. On one hand it's a load of crap. On the other hand its, "well, you wanted equality". Its time to give men the same respect in parenting. No more of this every other weekend crap. That's so 1996.
It's a Tupac kind of morning. 	"Only God Can Judge Me"!!!!		#SpeakYourself
@JFGlass @GovHowardDean @Publix Your man card has been deducted 5 points for being a bitch.

Still searching for an explanation from @lakecountybar or any other domestic violence propagandist that opposes 50/50 shared parenting. How many of these kids have fathers that would love to be with them instead of being forced to pay for child care. #Illinois #twill #ILgov https://t.co/ctY1CCSey2
RT @Intelligencia76: To those living in the 45th ward of #Chicago I just want to remind you that @JohnArena445 is the kind of guy who pals…
@RagingGayCons Government has no business in the institution of marriage, heterosexual or otherwise.  I don't care what two consenting adults do.
@Hotel511 Typical sociopath.
@CHEWYBARISTA @MrDaMonopoly Yes, we are split on abortion. I campaigned on non taxpayer funded abortion but did not go so far as to say ban all abortion. I know black markets get created and doesn't address underlying issues. But this is ridiculous.
I find it funny that domestic violence groups make these claims that men are violent creatures yet we have liberal women foaming at the mouth to have the right to murder an infant. News flash....the babies body isn't yours. Cause science!!!!  #babies #BornAliveAct #MAGA https://t.co/ALtRyTozbu
I feel certain that opposition to a shared parenting bill has nothing to do with their profit margin. How many of these opponents like @lakecountybar would willingly accept less than 20% of the year with their children while losing 50-60% of their income. #twill #Illinois #ILgov https://t.co/wdHHmTe3JD
@BeerJudge123 @KristySwansonXO You're kind of a needle dick...no not kinda. You are.
@BaconShark @StatsInTheWild I second that.
@StatsInTheWild Wait a second. So you mean I didn't earn my benefits after 20 years in the service. Maybe I should learn how to read a contract. Either that or you've just shown your idiocy AGAIN! Earned....not given..	Genius. Tell your mom I said hi.
@StatsInTheWild Awww....the good doctor cant take a joke. You do know, laughter is the best medicine. Of course you do. It says Dr. in your profile.
@StatsInTheWild That's courtesy of the geniuses in Illinois government. But congrats on showing everyone another example of you not knowing what the hell you're talking about. Schmuck.
@StatsInTheWild I do.  Your mom didnt tell you. Well that's just like her. She must have spent it on meth again.
@StatsInTheWild Fantastic. I can sleep better tonight knowing that.
@lad1121 @SenDuckworth @DickDurbin That can smoke check you and most 18 year olds in a sprint, mile and a half, push ups,  pullups or any other category. Punk.
@lad1121 @SenDuckworth @DickDurbin Not gonna happen cupcake.
@lad1121 @SenDuckworth @DickDurbin While you're at it, take that humanity profile pic down since you only care about ending it.
@lad1121 @SenDuckworth @DickDurbin Retweet that 1,000 times. I'm no politician so if you want me to be polite to you while you advocate killing kids, you're sorely mistaken. Look on my profile and tell me where it says, "pillar of the community". I'm a human being fighting for other human beings.
This man gets to see and speak to his kids regularly. But he made sure I cant. One year no contact with my daughter. What does the 8th Amendment say @LakeCountyIL? What was my crime? I just wanted to be a dad. Judge Salvi should have recused. Huge conflict of interest! https://t.co/WrtdUjoCu1
@HawleyMO Do I have an implied right to be a father to my kids because it's not spelled out in the Constitution. One year and not a single day with my daughter.  Not even a phone call. Twenty years of military service to be discarded like trash. Tell me Mr. Hawley, what would you do.
@scottbacky I'm sick of the bastards. Fed up. One year and not a single day with my daughter.  Not even a phone call. I've about had it.
@niaplatt2 @SenDuckworth @DickDurbin You dont think it should be criminal? Sorry, I do.
@lad1121 @SenDuckworth @DickDurbin Go fuck yourself murderer.
@mnic412 Thanks Mike.
@realPolitiDiva There is something seriously wrong in our nation.
@ManlyhoodTVShow It needs to be covered more frequently.
This is an understatement. But certainly on the right track. Men today live in fear. Sadly they have examples such as mine. Get married and have kids.  When that doesn't work out you get taken to the cleaners and then thrown out with the trash. You're not a father. You're an atm. https://t.co/wiHno60PZj
Shame on you @SenDuckworth and @DickDurbin. You didn't even have the common damn decency to save a child from a botched abortion. You make me sick. Especially you Tammy. You are a new mom. Guess that child has no Constitutional rights. Fuck you both.
Another day, another Senators office that tells me there's nothing they can do. "Hire an attorney". What do you do when you're a parent who only wants to raise your kids. You've spent $60k, represented yourself for over two years, and even ran for governor.  Just to be a dad...
@matissemagic @Zenophite @gatewaypundit @USATODAY At least you're honest.
@dsygop @MadHatter9797 @McAllisterDen Love doesn't win court cases. That's so ridiculous I dont even know where to start. Love is what drove me forward after i ran out of money. Love kept me in the law library for hours upon hours. Can you or Mrs Judgemental day the same?
@0993210712Dave @McAllisterDen $60k wasted. Exactly how much money do you think the average person has.
@MadHatter9797 @McAllisterDen Look nutjob. Dont preach to me until you've been separated from your child and then decimated in every form trying to be a parent. Easy to sit up there and judge when you've never lived it.
@MadHatter9797 @McAllisterDen Its judgemental people like you that have no clue what the system does to good parents every day. You have no idea of the Constitutional infringement that occurs daily in these courts. You're not pro veteran or 2A. If you were you would educate yourself before spouting off.
@MadHatter9797 @McAllisterDen Then tell me what you know about veterans high rate of homelessness being linked to the destruction of family court. Tell me what you know of the link of 22 a day killing themselves  and that link to family court. Tell me what you know of missing years with your child.
@MadHatter9797 @McAllisterDen Look at you all pro veteran, pro 2A. Tell me what you know of 2A rights being stripped by way of orders of protection that contains the lowest standard of evidence (preponderance) to obtain. Tell me what you know of going bankrupt fighting to merely be involved in your kids life.
@MadHatter9797 @McAllisterDen What makes you think I haven't PAL. You dont know a damn thing about me or my case. Enjoy the view atop your high horse oh single mom of glory. Shall we bow down and worship you?
@SilvinaFlorida @McAllisterDen You dont know the difficulties with the judge and the court. I've been an outspoken critic of how family court operates. As a result the judge frequently cuts my contact with my kids. Not because I'm a threat to my kids. Because im a threat to their system.
@McAllisterDen @MadHatter9797 Do you or your ex know of the federal funding the state receives? Title IV D/E of the social security act. Ask yourself why there are 20 million kids growing up absent their biological father.  Then follow the money.
@SilvinaFlorida @McAllisterDen That's hard to do when the mother blocks your number and email address.
@MadHatter9797 @McAllisterDen There are millions of gate keepers just like her. Police and court does nothing. But get behind on the ridiculous child support order and watch how quick courts become involved.
@MadHatter9797 @McAllisterDen Over 100 court appearances. Dont tell me I haven't fought to be a father to my children. Continuing to go to court was doing more harm than good. I told the mother I am willing to work together outside of court.  She ignores all messages and request for me to see my kids.
@MadHatter9797 @McAllisterDen Wrong. You may want to know something about my case before jumping to conclusions.  $60k wasted on useless attorneys. I am the victim of a system that cares about their profit margin as well as punishing someone who advocated for reform. It is an act of reprisal from the judge.
@McAllisterDen It's hard to swallow my bitterness when I haven't spent one day with my daughter in a year. I've had one phone call with my son since November. This is what feminism has done. I'm not viewed as a father with intrinsic value as a man. I'm an ATM. I'm a privileged white male.
@McAllisterDen @ShaggyKC When you said, "fight the enemy" I was under the impression negotiations have failed. I speak frequently about the harm modern feminism is doing and has done. I assure you,  I'm no friend of 3rd wave feminist. I speak loud and often. I love my 1st Amendment.
@McAllisterDen @ShaggyKC Of course you say something. But as I have learned through my years people like this change when they are ready.  Not when I try and force it. I have friends that struggle with addiction. They know my position.  So i support from afar. I cannot babysit them 24/7.
@McAllisterDen @ShaggyKC If a man wearing a dress is my biggest threat, I can go ahead and unload my Glock.
@McAllisterDen @ShaggyKC Strong men step up when hostility reveals itself. I do not use my strength to intimidate others into accepting my belief system. If someone tries to intimidate me or another or use force against them to bend them to their will, you will then see my strength.
@McAllisterDen @ShaggyKC Well they're not being forced to fight. At least not yet. I did 20 years in the military. I hate the social experiments. But I'm also not one to tell a qualified individual they cant die for their country if they so choose. I believe in traditional roles.  But that's me.
1. Guns dont commit violence, people do.	2. They live in fear because of fear mongering. 1 in 614,000,000. That's the odds.	3. Of course it's not normal. You don't seem to mind about those inner city kids though. 	4. We have background checks. They're doing wonders. Ex. Chicago https://t.co/TeX4EFnidI
@ShaggyKC @McAllisterDen Here is where we wade into murky water. Your definition and someone else's may differ a great deal. I believe in live and let live. I dont care if someone is gay or if they smoke cannabis. Someone else may care. So your opinion of a gay man who smokes cannabis may differ.
@McAllisterDen I think that's the difference. Your level of appropriate and someone else's can differ greatly. Who sets that's standard? Libertarians are some of the most principled people I know. The proper role of government is to defend individual liberty. How you live isn't my business.
@McAllisterDen I'm libertarian. There is a difference in accepting it and not really giving a damn what another person does with their own life. Personally I think its idiotic. But in a free country you're free to be an idiot. His action didn't hurt me or my property.
I feel certain no animosity is ever created when you have race baiters like @JussieSmollett staging fake hate crimes while the left incessantly accuses anyone who voted for Trump as being racist, nazis, fascist, homophobic,  etc. https://t.co/UqgSnltLig
@JebClampett1 @secdef @SECNAV75 @SECNAV @SecAFOfficial @SecArmy @USNavy @USArmy @USMC @AFPAA @codeofvets Look. You're being a lawyer. I get it.  The point is that our young men and women have a duty to know each amendment, what its purpose is, and even some case law surrounding it. The same as our police. I didn't say they need to be able to write an amicus curiae brief.
@gatewaypundit @cristinalaila1 That'll show him. You take that Trump.  Lol...I'm pissing my pants. I've never seen do much idiocy in all my life. God why can't I be 12 again and live in ignorant bliss.
@McAllisterDen You want to know why so many boys are raised by single moms? Like my son.
@ShaunfromEP He was.
@JebClampett1 @secdef @SECNAV75 @SECNAV @SecAFOfficial @SecArmy @USNavy @USArmy @USMC @AFPAA @codeofvets I disagree. Rights are trampled every day because of ignorance. On the part of government actors as well as citizens. It's easier to hold someone accountable when you know what is or isn't lawful. They are also less likely to push the boundary if they know you're educated.
@chuckanw There is a difference in having a familiarity with it and really knowing it. Service members are paid to defend it. That is literally their job.
@JebClampett1 @secdef @SECNAV75 @SECNAV @SecAFOfficial @SecArmy @USNavy @USArmy @USMC @AFPAA @codeofvets Dont get your panties in a twist.  The way you structured your sentence, it read as though you were stating the 4th prohibits cruel and unusual punishment.
@JebClampett1 @secdef @SECNAV75 @SECNAV @SecAFOfficial @SecArmy @USNavy @USArmy @USMC @AFPAA @codeofvets I agree. They made the wrong argument.  It should not have been made on a privacy matter. It should have been made on a right to life matter.
@JebClampett1 @secdef @SECNAV75 @SECNAV @SecAFOfficial @SecArmy @USNavy @USArmy @USMC @AFPAA @codeofvets The 4th is against illegal search and seizure. The 8th prohibits cruel and unusual punishment.  You're not an attorney are you?
@JebClampett1 @secdef @SECNAV75 @SECNAV @SecAFOfficial @SecArmy @USNavy @USArmy @USMC @AFPAA @codeofvets Forgive me. I'm a lowly blue collar man without the Ivy league education. I hadn't realized the framers of the Constitution only intended for a scholar to be able to interpret this document. Where have I heard of this before....oh yeah, the Dark Ages.
I started to watch the Oscar's but I figured I would just punch myself repeatedly. It's me doing my part on the Green New Deal. Im saving electricity and brain cells. Plus its far less painful. #Oscars
@MarsWolf That's right. Close all the loop holes.
@rdsanchezjr @MillerStream Careful sir. You might have mutiny on your hands if your troops ever figure out there are other amendments.
@MillerStream The Constitution is not and never was a perfect document. I know, I know...I may burst into flames for such rhetoric.The War on Drugs is a failed policy which has only destabilized communities and created massive black markets.I dont care about voluntary exchange between adults.
@JebClampett1 @secdef @SECNAV75 @SECNAV @SecAFOfficial @SecArmy @USNavy @USArmy @USMC @AFPAA @codeofvets There is nothing liberal about knowing what the hell you're defending. If you cant name an amendment after the first two, how in the hell can you support and defend the Constitution? How can you challenge an Unconstitutional order? You cant.Those are surprising remarks. Attorney?
@JebClampett1 @secdef @SECNAV75 @SECNAV @SecAFOfficial @SecArmy @USNavy @USArmy @USMC @AFPAA @codeofvets That's how you get the Gestapo. A well educated society is a well armed society.  I detest the notion that you only need to follow orders. The oath is to the Constitution.  If you are given an Unconstitutional order you need to know it when you hear it.
The answer is not to include women in selective service. The answer is to end conscription.  If it is not ended I would offer this. The 1st to be drafted will be the sons and daughters of people in all three branches of government. They will all go directly to infantry. #MAGA https://t.co/g5qObUCU8l
@ida_skibenes Thats racist. You presume because the person is white that they think they're entitled to be treated better. So white people's rights are not violated? You seriously dont watch the news. Here's one,from USA Today. It is Unconstitutional to make only males register for the draft.
@patg00 @secdef @SECNAV75 @SECNAV @SecAFOfficial @SecArmy @USNavy @USArmy @USMC @AFPAA @codeofvets Of course it should. Every citizen should be well versed by the time they are voting age.
@HardHeaded4 @secdef @SECNAV75 @SECNAV @SecAFOfficial @SecArmy @USNavy @USArmy @USMC @AFPAA @codeofvets I wont disagree with that but there is a substantial difference in should know it and being paid to defend it.
Well this explains how Democrats keep winning. https://t.co/pi4VT9P7SQ
I cant believe it took 40 years for a judge to make this finding.We must end conscription all together. I served 20 yrs. You cant have my kids.Send yours.		With women in combat roles, a federal court rules the male-only draft unconstitutional https://t.co/rQYYOy4GCe via @usatoday

@StuartSB13X I've had many reach out to me from the UK because of it. It is prevalent in developed countries. Whether it is a sinister plot for Social Engineering or merely a consequence of poor policy is the question.
More people need to understand,  fathers are less prevalent in large part because of Federal Incentives (Title IV). 20 million kids growing up absent their biological father. It creates more social issues with our kids and more reliance upon the state. Family law is responsible. https://t.co/TvUOXfmTm7

@dylanewells @ShiaKapos @ChicagoMaroon @uchicagogate Then where are the charges? Oh that's right...there aren't any.
@jktv @ShiaKapos @ChicagoMaroon So allegations with no charges are what we use to condemn someone. Maybe rethink that before you find yourself on the receiving end of one of these garbage EOPs.

@gabecubed @Suntimes @TinaSfon The most telling piece is when they state the standard of evidence required to obtain one. Preponderance is as low as you can get. It's done in an ex parte setting where the respondent isn't even present to defend themselves. No charges filed. End of story.
@Americaa4ever @thefotowarrior @Suntimes @TinaSfon Since when does an accusation equal guilt. This is the problem with so many people that spout off at the mouth. You know nothing of the grotesquely low standard of evidence required to obtain an order of protection. Much less the federal funding the state receives giving them out

Will the @ISBAlawyer please stand up and admit you are wrong. Admit that you are participating in opposing 50/50 shared parenting because those you represent (attorneys) stand to lose millions in profit every year.

@S0uthSide_Irish @ISBAlawyer It makes me sick to my stomach.

@reason A better option is that they dont pay taxes until legal voting age.
@SenDuckworth He's in good company. False accusations are the number one tool that are used in family courts to gain the upper hand in a custody proceeding. The difference is that those are rarely investigated and almost never punished. What's the cost? Children being torn from a loving parent
@hadighaemi @Mary52lrMaga @UNHumanRights So male prisoners are not vulnerable?
@activist360 @swhitey10 Let's not pretend that Democrats aren't guilty of this. I'm against corporate welfare but you're kidding yourself if you dont think both parties do this.

@TrumpFan80 My case stopped being a mere custody case years ago. It is a personal vendetta to destroy me for calling out @LakeCountyIL judges in the @19thCircuitIL and attorneys for their deceptive and disgusting practices.
@Tsothoggua I endured a terrible divorce and still do, four years later. Endless litigation. They scream for more money, I cry for more time. They used me running for office and calling out the impropriety of the judicial system as justification to say I didn't want to be with my kids.
@Benji_Benjy Read clearly. I did not blame the media for the separation. I blame media for not more thoroughly covering what has happened to law abiding Americans for decades.
8th Amendment-Prohibits cruel and unusual punishment.  The media cries foul about illegals being separated from their kids but remain silent as I, a 20 year Navy veteran have been unlawfully kept from my daughter for a year. One phone call with my son since November.  #Maga https://t.co/J2XwL7iScV
There is nothing honorable about a man that uses his judicial immunity to trample the lives of citizens. Ask the Honorable Judge Salvi how and why he reopened my case after it was removed to Federal Court and cut me off from my daughter a year ago. #Illinois #twill #Maga https://t.co/kVPQRtprYm
The @19thCircuitIL . One year I've not had a day with my daughter. Why dont you tell the citizens of Lake how you use sheriffs and court personnel to intimidate constituents. Tell them about the secret list shared between judges so you cant receive a fair hearing. #Illinois
@LadyThriller69 You're a good person with a good heart.Yes there are racist white people There are racist blacks, Hispanics, asians, etc.Most white people will condemn that wherever it comes from, just as I believe all the others would. We shouldn't tolerate it, not matter who says it.
Help us to help out this veterans family. Thank you! https://t.co/8B88QzPdej
@John_Kass That's certainly something I will agree with you on.
@jestkathy @IsIllinois I get similar treatment in @LakeCountyIL. Who knew fighting to be a father to your children would result in being treated like a criminal.  One year, not a day with my daughter. This is how they treat 20 year military veterans.
@JussieSmollett committed a disgusting act that could have resulted in two innocent people serving time or worse. Fact is no one got hurt, thank goodness. With that said I think he should do a little time followed by community service.  Like wearing MAGA gear till the election.

@WalshFreedom I want to know where is the evidence that was used to launch the investigation to begin with.
@STxStargazer @codeofvets I like her a lot.  Great lady.
@STxStargazer It's a Destroyer and a Carrier.
@codeofvets Looks like a DDG and a Carrier.
You make me sick lady. You have no problem with your fellow attorneys churning their $50billion a year family law industry and separating fit and loving AMERICAN parents from their children yet you fake your outrage at what's happening at the border.  You're a political windbag. https://t.co/A0LDJurIzn

@T_S_P_O_O_K_Y @FBI @EpochTimes @Comey @JohnBrennan One of the more thorough and impressive interviews I have seen to date. As a former member of a similar community I applaud your assessment of failure within these communities, whether by sheer incompetence or by willful contempt. There is a way forward. Thank you.
@Mr_MAGA1776 @Hermoso1 @realDonaldTrump End the state slush fund known as Title IV funding.  Stop separating good parents from their children in family court. Start locking up the tyrants in black robes that terrorize their communities with impunity.
@CarmineSabia Send me a picture or two when you get them in.
You went overseas to aid terrorist in blowing up my brothers and sisters. You can sit around a campfire with your fellow terrorist brides in Syria and discuss the "oppressive American patriarchy as far as I'm concerned". #terrorism #MAGA #Illinois https://t.co/kYQG73VqUa

@DiverDesert @mitchellvii @AOC I was talking about Bill's tweet. When someone says, "making $150k a year" many including myself believe that means salary. Not salary plus benefits. Stop being so testy. It's a matter of interpretation when it's not explicitly written.

@CTruth1965 @mitchellvii @AOC I wouldnt know what to do with myself if I made that much. Guess I might actually take a vacation.
@CTruth1965 @mitchellvii @AOC I guess for a blue collar guy like me its surprising.  Hell, it's down right shocking. Especially to consider 25k jobs in one place with that being the average.
@CarloLang8 @CTruth1965 @mitchellvii @AOC Guess I need to take my resume down to Mr. Bezos. Lol
@CTruth1965 @mitchellvii @AOC How many of these are janitorial, maintenance, grounds keeping, IT, secretary, etc....I would have liked to seen a budgetary breakdown. Somehow I think you may have had some top executives being paid extremely high salaries pushing that average higher.
@mitchellvii @AOC I think you put more zeros in there than what reality says. My mother worked for Amazon. They sure as hell aren't paying 25,000 people an average of 150k a year salary. Let's be realistic here.
I dont know how I missed this survey of "experts" that subjectively listed the US as being in the top ten most violent places to live for women based on zero empirical data that I can find from the survey. Only 550 opinions from around the globe. 		https://t.co/WdI8RdlXhM

@StatsInTheWild Like most things I look at root causes. Predominantly most violent crime comes from economically suppressed regions where the state has assumed the role of father figure and provider. Poor economy =black market economy=high incarceration =fatherless homes=instability and crime.
@StatsInTheWild Certainly people have more reasons than just taxes but I believe taxes, and burdensome regulations coupled with a very corrupt government have been the predominant drivers.
@Tsothoggua Libertarianism is a collection of philosophical ideas. There is not a strict adherence or agreement in many areas. Which is why it is not a strict political government system in place throughout the world. You see many elements in different forms.
@StatsInTheWild That's correct and it may very well be a reason the state population continues to decline by nearly 40k a year. The tax base shrinks while government spending expands. How do you see that playing out in the next decade?
@StatsInTheWild @JBPritzker Yet you demean me in my loss and celebration of my "moral victory" so the implication doesn't align with your statement.  I entered the arena knowing full well what my prospects looked like. I was not deterred. I will not allow a rigged political system to remain unchallenged.
Libertarianism (from Latin: libertas, meaning "freedom") is a collection of political philosophies and movements that uphold liberty as a core principle.		On the contrary Doctor.  Libertarianism is quite popular. https://t.co/qsloEtqMat
@StatsInTheWild The mere fact that you seem to have no issue with that is what's positively disturbing. Screw having representation from the working class. Let's just let the wealthy buy all the political power they need to continue the abuse in perpetuity.
@StatsInTheWild I guess the case in Chicago Ward 13 between Marty Quinn and David Kruppa missed your radar.
@StatsInTheWild @JBPritzker I know exactly what you meant. Your sarcasm is noted.
@StatsInTheWild @JBPritzker Yeah, nutcase. Because wanting limited government, expanded civil liberties, and less taxation is crazy in a progressive socialist mind.
@StatsInTheWild Please find where I stated that doctor.  Actually what I stated was that it was purchased,  not won.
@StatsInTheWild Dont even get me started on your number of votes bullshit. Because Democrats aren't known for election fraud. Do I need to pull any recent cases for you or is your short term memory sufficient to recall.
@StatsInTheWild Yeah, what a moral victory @JBPritzker had. Spending $171million of his inheritance to buy the Governors seat. The hypocrisy of leftist is astounding.  They hate the wealthy but have no problem with them buying their way into the top political seats.
The @IRStaxpros are anything but pros unless it involves separating you from your hard earned money. While trying to reset my account password I found a couple nifty mistakes. Can you find them? 		#TaxationIsTheft https://t.co/i7iSodr6sM
@foxbatcrash I issued a public statement opposing the separation of children and their parents at the border. I have fought vigorously for family.  Namely to ensure American parents aren't separated from their kids in the for profit American judicial system.
@StatsInTheWild That's comical. Seeing how your "Conservative Party" plant was there to split votes. Do me a quick favor because you love to debate. Tell me how many dollars were spent per vote for each of the four candidates. I will wait. Its elementary math. Merely simple division.
As I said when this case 1st popped.  Hmmmmmm this sure is interesting. Which is exactly what I meant.  		#JussieSmollett https://t.co/m1TPjYddtA

@StatsInTheWild Yeah he knows full well that five officers were shot.  If we had people conceal carrying the number might have been zero.  Secondly, that is what police sign up for.  It's a dangerous job.  It takes extreme courage to run into danger in that fashion.
@CheckYourRoots Let's be honest.  There are plenty in unions down state that are told how to vote and many remain in lockstep.  It's sad but its true.
@heatherRoach84 Thank you Heather!
Man oh man.  Sorry but you get what you asked for.  Same ole, tax and spend Democrats. What's @JBPritzkers plan to eliminate the debt? Increase minimum wage to $15 an hour and drive out small businesses in an attempt to increase tax revenue. https://t.co/hz72mu1Q6g

@elizabeth_ra_st I had my fill with organized religion. I talk to God on my backporch with my coffee or in the wilderness where my heart feels at home. Not in a multi million dollar facility where comdenation is heaped upon me. I know I have my issues but so does everyone.
@elizabeth_ra_st I quit going to church when my ex wife was giving them upwards of $1,200 a month while simultaneously claiming I didn't support her and my kids and leaving me homeless in WA while she hid her $87k a year salary from me. The church wouldnt assist me. They told me to pray about it.
@elizabeth_ra_st I'm talking about anyone that doesn't align with Christian beliefs. Not you. My words of leave me alone and I leave you alone is a libertarian position. I wasnt literally telling you to leave me alone.
@elizabeth_ra_st I don't think it's the church ranking sins. It just happens to be one of the many stated positions of the church. Same goes for infidelity, lying, etc. The LGBT community focused on the one that pertained to them.  The fact is, they don't want anyone denouncing their lifestyle.
@elizabeth_ra_st "Being anti LGBT is wrong. There aren't two sides." I'm not the smartest but it seems she stated very clearly that if you're not pro LGBT then you're wrong. I see it this way. Leave me the hell alone and I leave you the hell alone. If you don't like Christian doctrine, don't go.
@elizabeth_ra_st I have yet to see something produced that his church "hates gays". A tenant of Christianity is recognizing what they believe to be traditional marriage between one man and one woman. That is not hate. Hate is a radical Muslim throwing a gay off a roof top.
Keep on rolling sir! https://t.co/S41Xlc4E5M

@bobsinha Interesting theory but I think it has more of an opposite effect.  We have people being hired based upon a worthless liberal arts degree because mommy and daddy could afford it instead of the young man or woman who has 4-6 years experience in that industry.

@Dad22Jerk Why don't you tell me what I did for the government?
@SquirrelTomatos Let me address a few points.  Your so called assault rifles are fired at the same speed as a semi auto handgun.  Depends on how fast the user pulls the trigger.  There is no selectable rates of fire such as three round burst or full auto. So they're not infantry useable.
@SquirrelTomatos You do realize our military still possesses this technology you give so much credence to and we're still in Afghanistan nearly 20 years later.  I've got 20 years of military experience.  I know full well what we're capable of.
@SquirrelTomatos Can you please define "assault" rifle.
@SquirrelTomatos You ever read the story of 1776? Maybe give it a read sometime and let me know how this nation was founded.  A small and outmatched fighting force stood opposed to the largest and most well equipped military the world had ever seen.  Their blood gave birth to your Twitter feed.
Oh I assure you @dbongino , the military and courts are no exception.

@court_mcf The point is the ability for a person to choose. We are not applying the same standard.  One screen shot of CDC reports  will clearly show what's killing Americans.

@armavitusa Drug crime is a misnomer like gun crime.  Objects dont commit crimes, people do.  Someone robbing a store to purchase drugs creates a victim.  A person using those drugs harms no one but themselves.  No different than the alcoholic or smoker.
@CHOCOLATEBLIS2 I grew up a poor white kid in the south.  The only benefits I had were being poor and seeing the struggles of my family.  I learned to work like a dog on the roof of a home in 110 degree heat, bail hay,  and hunt to put food on the table.  It was and is still my privilege.
I'm glad the government reopened.  I'm on my way to the Office of White Privlege to apply for my benefits. https://t.co/3ZkNUbrhQs
@CHOCOLATEBLIS2 The uncomfortable truth is that as long as the black community votes for Democrats in mass the system you speak of will continue.  Stop buying into the fear and propaganda that Republicans and Libertarians are racist.  I advocated for ending mass incarceration.
@CHOCOLATEBLIS2 I have not made any claims as to what these men thought or believed.  I can't say the same for you.  We can debate 200 years of history as much as you like but the fact remains that no one living today had anything to do with it.  I will acknowledge but won't take blame for it.
@CHOCOLATEBLIS2 Can you please provide insight into how you know the heart and mind of over 300k men that lived over 150 years ago.
@CHOCOLATEBLIS2 Please enlighten me on exactly what they died for?
@CHOCOLATEBLIS2 Men fighting for their freedom.  Imagine that.  Are you suggesting these black men that fought alongside the Union soldiers did not want to play a part in liberating other slaves? That's terribly disingenuous to suggest.
@CHOCOLATEBLIS2 What evidence would you like? How about the 360,000 plus deaths of Union soldiers to end slavery? What greater apology can there be than the death of thousands to right a wrong.  Now let's talk about how many of those men died having never owned a slave.
@KristatheYoung1 I completley agree with addressing and fixing crap policies.  That's a far cry from shouldering the responsibility for something as atrocious as slavery.
@CHOCOLATEBLIS2 Please forward me my family lineage as well since you're more of an expert on my ancestry than me.  I don't know anyone beyond my great grandparents on my mother's side.
@CHOCOLATEBLIS2 Please forward me your request for apology from tribes like the Cherokee that owned thousands of slaves.  I would love to read it.  Your claim that the entire continent of Africa has apologized for their participation in the slave trade is not rooted in empirical evidence.
@CHOCOLATEBLIS2 "I won't own what my people did". Fine,  let's see if you will lace up that shoe and wear it.  When will you seek an apology from Africans for enslaving and selling their own people? When you get an apology from the continent of Africa then I will consider your request.
@court_mcf Victimless means the person commiting the act harmed no one but themselves.  They are a victim of their own choices. To my knowledge no one has sued themselves for being a victim of their own stupidity.That is what American jurisprudence is for. Grievances against others actions.
@CHOCOLATEBLIS2 I'm not apologizing for something I had no part in.  This collective blaming because of my skin tone is a significant issue.  If youre seeking an apology I suggest going to those you have grievance with.
@OttesenAo Facts don't care about your emotion.  Please show me with empirical evidence that we have stopped the flow of drugs.  If we can't keep them out of federal prisons with razor wire,  dogs, 30 ft walls,  and armed guards,  how do you keep them off the streets?
@Punkster1011 Can I get an amen!
@jeeper64060 I didn't defend the actions of shooting the cops now did I? I addressed poor policy that led to the cops entering the residence.  Please don't misconstrue what I have clearly stated.
@OttesenAo So are millions of deaths as they relate to alcohol,tobacco, and refined sugar.  Should we begin mass incarceration of executives of Cocoa Cola, Marlboro, and Budweiser and their buyers? Shouldn't we at least prioritize as a nation? Tell me the top three killers on CDC reports.
@jeeper64060 Didnt blame the cops.  I blamed the policy. I'm curious if you will hold a similar view for police kicking doors in to seize firearms when states like New York and California begin wide scale confiscattion efforts? Poor policy has far reaching effects.  This is one example.
@jeeper64060 Seems like you don't understand victimless crime.  The mere possession or use of drugs harms no one but that person.  Shooting someone without cause is a crime.  See the difference.  Had the police not been used and sent into the home,  they would not have been shot.
What happened to natives and blacks in our nation's history is a travesty.  It saddens me that these events occurred.  But I and many others are tired of receiving blame for events that we had no part in.I will fight racism with you but will not be blamed for it.Sorry not sorry.
@armavitusa The commission of a property or personal crime is where a victim is now created. Can you show me that the war on drugs has been successful? How much is still being seized? How many lives are still being lost? Clearly people still choose to do it.  No victim,  no crime.
I will voice an unpopular opinion amongst my conservative friends.  The War on Drugs is a catastrophic failure.  Billions, if not trillions of tax dollars wasted and countless lives lost.  Stop sending our police to enforce victimless crime laws.  Poor policy put them at risk. https://t.co/HnK66ZPhyZ

I believe both the natives and Catholic kids were only exploited by the racist,  bigoted,  Black Hebrews.  They created a shit storm and then stepped back to watch it unfold.  This is what they wanted.  Racial tension and more divide.  Stop giving it to them.  #CovingtonCatholic

@Lixen123 @neil_firszt @DewsNewz Let's not get all nuclear with our comments.  The kids have some responsibility in their actions.  They could have neutralized it by walking away.  I would not have condoned their behavior.  I'm not incorrect in that position.
@compumomma @MuslimIQ This entire thread is filled with misinformed people.  The hate speech was pouring from the Black Hebrews.  Where are your comments of comdenation for them?
You are incorrect.  Watch the entire 2 hour video.  There was nothing but pure hatred spewing out of the mouth of the Black Hebrews for 30-45 minutes.  That is what initiated the entire events. https://t.co/xSKvbgsAr4
@AnwuliHenrietta @MuslimIQ I guess the Black Hebrews calling the native American men Uncle Tomahawks gets a pass then.  What about when they denigrated gay's and Christians? How about when they called whites crackers and peckerwood?  Do they have any responsibility?
@parkinglotpuddl @MuslimIQ Wrong.  Watch the 2 hour video
@KeelinSKewee @MuslimIQ @RavMABAY I did see the full 2 hour video.  They weren't Muslims.  I believe they were Black Israelites.  They spewed hateful and derogatory remarks at everyone.  Including natives.
@TruthMom4 @Yankee9095 In this environment they should have expected counter protestors.  What is the point of having a chaperone if they're not with the kids? I would not have allowed my kids to engage in such a manner if  I worked for the school.
@neil_firszt @DewsNewz Well I didn't fully retract my statement.  They still had some culpability because they could have walked away,  staged in a different area, not engaged the Black Hebrews, etc.  I don't think the kids are assholes but they didn't behave in a manner I would have been proud of.
@neil_firszt @DewsNewz Then why such strong condemnation for me.  I'm as human as you and susceptible to making a mistake.

@sofaking1170 I made three trips there and was present when Army Corp issued the declaration for evacuation.  There is a difference in leaving and being forced out.  I assure you the camp was kept clean. They made a concerted push and bulldozed the camp into piles.  Big difference.
@_dingl They played a part in escalating the situation.  They deserve no award for that.
@JessTurnerCRU I do not know if he heard what the Black Hebrews said to native Americans a full 30-45 minutes before he showed up.  We do not know that.  It doesn't mean he lied.
@JessTurnerCRU I did not download it.  Do a simple google search.  It's being shared.
@JessTurnerCRU Watch the entire 2 hour video.  I did this morning.
@JessTurnerCRU I did not sympathize with the Black Hebrews.  Come on. I admitted where I erred.  I hope you're adult enough to do the same.
@JessTurnerCRU I don't care what they called him.  They denigrated Native Americans and their form of worship multiple times before they walked over.  You want me to believe they were insulting their elder? Wrong.  They are Black Hebrews that denounce Native Americans and others.  Watch more.
@traderjohnt1 The kids didn't have to engage the Black Hebrews.  They could have stayed themselves elsewhere.  They did play a part in escalating the situation.
@SDreg8 @HersheSquirt If you think the teenagers had no responsibility then you are terribly misguided.  They escalated the situation.  The chaperones should have been present.  All parties involved have a blame for how it unfolded.
We're all one people under the same set of stars.  Love your fellow man.  Break bread,  share a beer,  and humble yourself.  We're all guilty of being wrong and hurting someone.  America must do better.  Our kids are depending on it.  #CovingtonCatholic #NathanPhillips #MAGA https://t.co/guySF2oPAI
@sofaking1170 I made three trips to Standing Rock.  I don't think that qualifies as instigating or being an antagonist.
I hope the grades and graduation rate reflect this Superintendents salary.  I mean 99.9% graduation rate with at least 90% college graduation rates.  #twill #Illinois #ilgov https://t.co/uSwsfTiuZe
@LevequeThots @Intelligencia76 You don't think these kids could have gathered elsewhere.  You don't think they could have refrained from exchanging banter with the Black Israelites.  There are many different paths they could have chosen.  They chose to engage.  They chose to escalate.  They have responsibiliy.
@prezzy91 Won't be the 1st time.
@JSEIFERT10 @LydiaLynn89 I haven't seen a staged event by him.  I'm learning more.
@InspektorClouse You tube.
@MichelleMcC0323 I don't see a hoax.  I see a dynamic situation with multiple faucets that could have been avoided by all three parties.
@hallelujah27_ These kids still have some responsibility.  They also escalated the situation.  I am not wrong about that.
@Yankee9095 Sure does
@Michell39030764 Sticks and stones.  We teach it to our kids for a reason.  I'm not excusing the vitriol from the adults but we are equipping our youth for a complex world.
@ga_undrdawg Your legs are perfectly acceptable forms of transportation.  They could have just as easily removed themselves.
@LevequeThots @Intelligencia76 Please read my last sentence.  I'm abundantly clear.
@LydiaLynn89 I read the article.  Sorry. That isn't sufficient.
@DewsNewz I did not say they claimed it for their own use.  I merely said they were there and were singing,  dancing,  in a prayer circle.  I have been there several times.  I'm aware of the surrounding areas.  Each party has their own responsibility in what happened.
New Mexico,  we need you. https://t.co/ZnEpdcfRR5
@joel_capizzi Thank you as well.
@joel_capizzi Yes sir.  Thank you.
@DewsNewz In the early part of the video there are quite a few Native Americans there.  There was a prayer circle singing and dancing.  The Black Israelites insulted their method of prayer and called several of them Uncle Tomahawks so you are incorrect.
Nathan Phillips,  Catholic students,  Black Hebrews(Israelites) https://t.co/xTjZfqhhFl
@dymha1 I only heard one group call native Americans, "Uncle Tomahawks". They also said faggots,  crackers,  peckerwood, called Jesus Christ a pedophile,  insulted native ways of worship,  blue eyed devils,  etc... So tell me again they weren't the instigators of the entire thing.
@Mel93497183 I watched the video.  I wasn't taught anything about it.  So get your facts straight.  Just like I had to.
@Jim__Jackson No,  not entirely.  I'm going to discuss my thoughts in a live feed.
After watching the full 2 hour video of the  students and Native American Nathan Phillips, I see culpability with all parties.  The elder did approach the students.  The true antagonist though were the radical black religious group that were insulting everyone.  #NathanPhillips
@DewsNewz I finished watching the 2 hour video.  I don't believe they were set up as a propaganda piece.  They gathered at the steps of the memorial and were engaging with the radical black religious group. Nathan Phillips did directly approach them.  I believe all are guilty.
@neil_firszt @DewsNewz Please, allow us to see your infallible and clean record for the world to see.  I know one man who was infallible.  He was called Yeshua.
If someone has a full length video of what happened could you please send me the link.  I may be guilty of not researching before commenting on the events in DC with the Native American man and the high school kids.  If I was wrong then I owe an apology. #NathanPhillips video https://t.co/5MTcJKtowu
@PumpknSpiceSoul @DewsNewz The very core of being a principled person lies within their ability to say,  "I'm sorry,  I was wrong" and then learn from that mistake.  I was terrible at this in my younger years.  I've tried to remedy this shortcoming.
@TheDonnnieSharp Do you have a link? I saw what was in my feed.
@DewsNewz Thank you for the additional information.  You could have left out the douche part.  I will look for further evidence of what happened and if I was wrong I will retract my statement.  I'm not so prideful that I cannot admit that I got duped by fake media and propaganda.
@Pissnofflibera1 We don't know that.  Let's not pretend that any person or group of people are infallible.
@bill_tansey I think dental work is a little much.  I believe doing some volunteer service on a reservation and with our elderly for several weeks along with some rigourous p.t. sessions would drive the point home.
@justinandjen310 Absolutley not.  It's accountability for all.  Respect is a two way street.  These children should be thoroughly reprimanded. They're old enough to know better.
@lad1121 The content and message is the same.  If you care to debate "taxation is theft", I will gladly do that.  I'm not having a debate over who I share content from.
@lad1121 Because Freedom.  It could have been a piece done by MSNBC and I would have shared it.  The message is the same.  Are you offended by the content or the delivery?
@frycook1964 @PDog119 So the government ordered them to be Air Traffic Controllers? I hadn't realized that conscription was taking place.  On the contrary they do voluntarily show up in exchange for compensation in the form of dollars.  Do you think they wouldn't do the same if it were privatized?
@mep120183 @DominickIzzo They just can't even handle it.  Its comical.
@PDog119 If libertarian ideas begin to permeate both parties,  I'm OK with that.  Live and let live.  Keep your hands out of my wallet.  Don't hurt other people or take their property.  Etc... If they're promoting libertarian ideals then I will take that as a win.
@CHEWYBARISTA Fair enough.
@CHEWYBARISTA I think my point was made.  It's a libertarian position.  Her being one or not is semantics.
@PDog119 We align with many ideas from both parties do we not? That's what I shared.  A commonly held libertarian position.  I do the same for more left leaning ideas when I see one of interest. Those haven't really been headlines as of late.
@MrDaMonopoly @CHEWYBARISTA You mean I shared a libertarian idea? Oh the travesty.
@Sunbeam_Tyger It doesn't matter what you utilize it for.  Taking anothers property by force or threat of force will always be theft no matter how altruistic your motives.  I don't care what SCOTUS ruled.  Frankly speaking,  their paychecks come from that theft.  Conflict of interest maybe?
Well look at the young Libertarian putting it down.  Amen sister! https://t.co/rC7MNn1txc
@livtower @hayleyyjay Both lives have equal value.  As do ours.  Your life isn't more important than mine because of your sex.
@livtower @hayleyyjay You never asked me my position on foreign intervention.  You made a false assumption based upon my previous employment. So for the record I will tell you our troops should be here defending and taking care of our nation. Care to make another false assumption?

@FullofWynn She's a prime example of a need for expanded mental health services.
Yet you were threatened enough to comment.  Keep plastering that thick coat of makeup on.  I'm on my way to Home Depot.  I can get you some more spackle and a putty knife for a more even application.  Plus I get a military discount.  You win,  I win,  society wins. https://t.co/MZf0xzVfhW
@livtower @hayleyyjay Youre right. I am condeming a movement predicated on defending women and girls that simultaneously marches for the right to kill unborn girls.
@livtower @hayleyyjay Sure,  the child is not viable when they are forcibly removed with forceps after dissecting him/her. If it's not a child then why is it double murder if a mother and unborn child are killed? Its either a life or it isn't.  You know,  because science.
@TeenyTwoTimes Wrong.  I disagreed with their video advertising.  Stop exaggerating.  There are zero tears.
@hayleyyjay It's not your fault.  Whomever hurt you is responsibie.
@livtower @hayleyyjay I really enjoy the lefts hypocrisy.  You preach tolerance and acceptance in one breath and attack someones physical features in another.  Thank you for proving my point.  If we address toxicity it should be done with all people.  Yourself included.
@Astro_Clay @astronuts4 You guys look great! Proud of you!
@TeenyTwoTimes They don't hurt me at all.  They've got some great advertising. https://t.co/GInvJAaUdn
@urfav7head I'm not angry.  I disagree.  There is a difference.  Just say you believe vanilla ice cream is best.  I disagree and say chocolate is best.  Am I angry? No.  I just disagree.
@hayleyyjay I'm sorry you were hurt by someone.  Please do not project your pain on me.

@ModerateWisdom @DanielleIAOK Sure,  because I stand to make a buck after virtue signaling to the left after that oh so harmful capitalism starts negatively impacting my bottom dollar.  Maybe do someone more research on your virtuous Gillette and then tell me who's peddling bullshit.
@realGageFreeman Well after you spend 20 years in the military you can do that.  No one asked you to comment.  Looks like you weren't taught to not be toxic.  You know,  "If you don't have anything nice to say,  don't say anything". Watch the commercial.  I here it helps with that.

@CivettiAdrienne @R439878 @mikeboyd_eldoco @Gillette Thank you as well.  This is how civil discourse and debate should take place.
@CivettiAdrienne @JimJamLFC @mikeboyd_eldoco @R439878 @Gillette Without getting into a whole gender debate with you, I know of only two genders.  How you choose to live and be is entirely up to you and I don't attack anyone for their lifestyle.
@CivettiAdrienne @R439878 @mikeboyd_eldoco @Gillette This is why I don't take them seriously.  Sorry.  Not sorry.  They should stick to making and selling razors. https://t.co/ZFsFf93P9D
@CivettiAdrienne @R439878 @mikeboyd_eldoco @Gillette Last year I changed three flats for stranded ladies and taught them how to do it themselves for next time.  Also got a fellows keys out of his car after he locked them in.  Its really no effort when you're just helping your fellow man.
@justyemma You are a lovely and elegant lady.  Do not let morons influence your lifestyle.  Eat healthy,  work out,  stay consistent.  Splurge a little when you've done well.  Then hit the grind again.  But do it for you.  Not anyone else.
@winsorharmon @VANS_66 Heck yeah! Fellow Louisiana boy! Love me some LSU Football!
@CivettiAdrienne @mikeboyd_eldoco @R439878 @Gillette I will be anxiously awaiting the release of an ad that does the same for women.  I hope that your response towards that one is consistent with your remarks here.
@CivettiAdrienne @mikeboyd_eldoco @R439878 @Gillette It's the glaring hypocrisy for one.  Women are just as guilty of everything they accuse men of.  Secondly,  the men I know don't condone this behavior and for a corporation to insinuate that men as a sex need to step up is laughable.  It's more of the same that men are flawed.
@stripedbanana3 @CivettiAdrienne @R439878 @Gillette Exactly
@CivettiAdrienne @mikeboyd_eldoco @R439878 @Gillette I'm not hurt by either.  They're free to make their ads.  I'm free to criticize.  I don't need to be injured emotionally or physically to say something is crap.
@CivettiAdrienne @Kx7xxx @mikeboyd_eldoco @R439878 @Gillette Yeah,  I tend to not take my cues for my morals and values from a company that has objectified women in marketing for profit and then insinuates men need to improve themselves.  No thanks.
@CivettiAdrienne @mikeboyd_eldoco @R439878 @Gillette And how many women participate in the creation,  marketing,  and profiting of any ad that does that? Let's not pretend that these ads do not exist towards men as well.  I've seen Calvin Klien, Mens Health, Abercrombie and Fitch, etc. At least be morally consistent.

@Uboatvet Isn't that the damn truth!
@ajduggins @Aloe9678 @SoldiersWhisper Not exactly.
@Aloe9678 @SoldiersWhisper It's the other way around.  The left thinks being masculine means you can't be a good person.  Not that you get to determine who belongs in uniform anyways.
@l_pavlatos @US_Veteran_2014 @carl_cgrimes198 As an active duty service member I was ordered to relinquish over 40% of my pay.  I lived about 5 miles from my kids and I asked for equal custody or even to do child care five days a week.  All denied.   So my kids spent 20-30 hours a week in child care.
@thenofacekilla @nattynevada2 @TrilliaCelaeno @Gillette Wrong.  Paternity Fraud is 100% completed by women.  Unsuspecting men are duped every day by women who lead men to believe they are fathers of children and then use those men for financial gain.  I have three friends that this happened to.
@goldendoekd @BridgetKF30 @Gillette Good Ole Tinder.
@JoEllenMcManamo I'm not done yet Jo.  You know me as well as anyone.  I'm just regrouping.
@thenofacekilla @TrilliaCelaeno @Gillette I skimmed the article and as I suspected it is a terribly written piece that can be broken down. There are many flaws and misperceptions that the author used to misguide unsuspecting readers.
@Alifeguisado @Thinksoup1 You're extremely misguided.  There is no perfect economic system but it is the best there is.  We should have a free market approach and in a truly free market,  government doesn't pick winners and losers by way of massive tax breaks and corporate welfare.
@thenofacekilla @TrilliaCelaeno @Gillette You do know that those are against the law.  We have laws for these things.  So please be specific.  Give me specific examples and I will help fight anyone that does those things.

@joshNYa78 @KatTheHammer1 Thank you as well.  It means a lot.
@Michaelmrw @RazorPack65 Aye Aye Sir!
@Alifeguisado @MadMonkofPunk No,  because criminals are afforded more protection than someone in civil courts.  You dont get read your rights because you're never charged.  They use the contempt powers of the courts to throw you in debtors prisons that were supposedly outlawed.
@brnagain2ctruth Ain't taking no crap from a virtue signaling corporation who's sole objective is making more money.
@Alifeguisado @MadMonkofPunk Not that it's your business but I've paid over $100k in child support.  Real child support is being present to love, mentor,  discipline,  and guide your children.  You tell me how a father can effectively do that when they're given less than 20% of the year to be a dad?
@thenofacekilla @Tryndaboss @Gillette I'm not avoiding any of it.  I've made multiple points in where I disagree.  You dismissed them.  Which is why I said we should agree to disagree.  I'm not changing your mind and you're not changing mine.

@thenofacekilla @Tryndaboss @Gillette Where on God's green earth did I ever say I'm not perfect? You're drawing illogical conclusions simply because I don't agree with your position.

Thank you @Gillette for encouraging me to abandon my objectification of women.  What would I do without your moral compass to point me in the correct way? https://t.co/TY6qbtends
A sad reality.  I would venture to say that if full custody were more evenly split that the numbers may be similar.  Since women receive full custody the vast majority of the time,  it stands to reason that their numbers are higher. https://t.co/MzxsfRZOQZ
@MadMonkofPunk It's the whole,  "just pay your child support"  line.  I'm sorry,  I actually want to be a dad and raise my kids.  I don't want to pay someone else to do it.
@badri_nair Everything you use and do in your daily life has contributed to the death and displacement of wildlife.  So while you may be vegetarian,  you are responsible for indirectly killing animals and their habitat.  You may want to fully consider your actions before condeming mine.
@AveryChasten @tristanjangulo @DanielNewman Isn't that the truth
I ran for governor to fight back against a system that has treated me like a criminal when all I wanted was to be a dad.  It still amazes me that illegal aliens get attorneys to reunite them with their kids.  American Veterans get extorted and ripped from their children. https://t.co/uYtrf3Wfrl
This is an example of the unhinged left.  Let me break down his tweet. 		Failed Miserably=Didnt spend 200 million buying Governor seat. 		Name change=Its OK to change your gender but not your name.  		Found in contempt =We will fight for illegal immigrant kids but not Americans https://t.co/BoUm43SBho
@tristanjangulo @DanielNewman Grayson Kash Jackson is my real name.  Before using it as an insult that I changed my name,  maybe you should read the Chicago Tribune article on why I changed my name.  Unless you wanna attack all those Hollywood stars that have also changed their names.  #jackwagon
@tristanjangulo @DanielNewman When you say deadbeat ex husband what you really mean is a jackass judge ordered him to pay 40% of his income on active duty and over 50% once he retires from the navy. You also mean he loves his kids so much that he ran for governor so his kids would know he fought for them.
@tristanjangulo @DanielNewman When you say "he failed miserably" what you really mean is he didn't spend 209 million dollars buying the Governor seat.

@ross_fight It was bitter sweet.  Twelve months after I got out I ran for governor because I've been treated like a criminal in family court in Illinois.  I made it on the ballot and into a televised debate on NBC. As punishment the judge cut me off from my daughter  12 months ago.
Youre some clever bastards. I know you shadow banned me in my gubernatorial election.  I just want to know if my competitor @JBPritzker , aka Tons of Fun paid you to do it?

I disagree.  I think the most significant contributor is that men are teaching their sons that if and when they go through the shit cycle of family court that they will be left penniless and broken all while being denied contact with their children. It's too risky now. https://t.co/fD8Kr6fxBZ
@KristatheYoung1 It's important to understand what child support was intended for.  It was to recoup what tax payers provided in welfare to single mothers. It has become a money making scheme for those that wish to live off of others work and for states to receive federal subsidies.
@KristatheYoung1 Youre correct.  The child has the right to be raised equally by both parents.  That is child support.  Now it's time our courts came in line with that fact.
Let me remind the General of our "government". 		Dec 29, 1890-Wounded Knee.  150-300 Miniconjou and Hunkpapa Lakota killed after being largely disarmed by US Army. 		Feb 27, 1973-Wounded Knee round two.  1 Cherokee and 1 Oglala Sioux killed. 		This is the 2A at work. https://t.co/nR7vc3EFQF

@PMHAHoosier @ftw_gfid @historyisneeded @mccaffreyr3 Maybe you don't read history very well.  Two forces opposed the United States very well despite our immense fire power.  The Vietcong and the Taliban.  Let's not forget our ancestors that defeated the British as well.
@ftw_gfid @historyisneeded @PMHAHoosier @mccaffreyr3 I can't wrap my mind around morons that distrust the government, but want the government to be the only ones with guns.
@historyisneeded @ftw_gfid @PMHAHoosier @mccaffreyr3 Yeah. And they didn't have cell phones,  computers,  and endless gadgets to express their 1st amendment right either.  Guess you should turn all those in and start putting pen to paper.  Genius.
@PMHAHoosier @ftw_gfid @historyisneeded @mccaffreyr3 Yeah.  Just ask the native Americans about that.  You think they would have been slaughtered if they had been better equipped? Probably not.
@palomacreative @DahkotaRolling I did not say yours.  I said "most". Please follow my statements.  Do you and the father(s) have 50/50 custody? If this was the norm,  moms would have more time to further their education, work,  reduce child care cost,  have a personal life,  etc.
@palomacreative @DahkotaRolling Exactly how did you come to that conclusion when she didn't state in anywhere? You must be one of those honest mind readers.
@palomacreative @DahkotaRolling You do realize most child support owed is from fathers living below the poverty line? I'm glad you brought up education.  Did you know the child is more likely to drop out of school, live on welfare,  and become pregnant when the father is not in the picture.  #50/50
Here we have example "A" that the military does not teach the Constitution.  Exactly how do those that swear to "support and defend the Constitution" against all enemies foreign and domestic do that if they're not taught and tested on it while in service? https://t.co/8Dn0MkWfKC
@PMHAHoosier @mccaffreyr3 Real men don't shit on the Constitution.  Real men understand that the battle field can change from overseas to your front yard.  	Real men don't feel the need to tell another man whether he's a real man based on his arbitrary standard.
@pat_oleary2 @mccaffreyr3 I'm scrolling through the Constitution and I can't quite seem to find the section that discusses hunting.  Can you help me out?
@RodRescueman @DahkotaRolling I don't blame women.  I blame our lawmakers and the judiciary.
@DahkotaRolling Shall we discuss facts.  The fact is 85% of divorce are filed by women.  85% of Child support is paid by men.  Coincidence?  I don't think so.  If only custody determinations were as easy as you paint them to be.
@DahkotaRolling I posed an equality question. You perceived it to be anger towards women.  Its anger towards a biased and broken system. Fathers like me want to be involved.  We're kept at arms length.  Imagine losing years with your child Ypu would never get back.  Am I to be happy?
@DahkotaRolling Let me cut this argument short.  The standard should be 50/50 equal custody.  Do you notice I am advocating for fathers to do their share as a parent.  If they have the children equal amounts of time, it stands to reason they are providing half the cost.  That is child support.
Youre right.  I don't believe I should have to pay.  I should have to shoulder half the responsibility of being a parent.  That means changing diapers,  helping with homework,  doctors visits,  discipline,  etc.  It does not mean subsidizing a greedy woman. https://t.co/wvdqobou3D
This is what feminist propaganda looks like.  They attempt to misdirect responsibility for their actions.  Sorry,  that doesn't work here.  I speak for no one but me. https://t.co/ZxLEZ2aFKe
@DahkotaRolling 90% of all child support owed is owed by fathers making less than 10k a year.  That money is owed to the state to reimburse mothers who have accepted welfare benefits.  You perpetuate another manufactured myth of feminist propaganda. Continue on so I may dispel more of your lies.
@amuses Clearly I am speaking to what is legal in our society.  I am not speaking to each individual case.
@DahkotaRolling Reread my tweet very,  very slowly.  I say again very slowly.  In no part did I say I speak for men much less all men.  Your assertions are unfounded.
@DahkotaRolling You are bold in telling me what to do. I will be polite for now when I tell you,  you are talking to the wrong man.  To my knowledge it is not law that a man's permission is required to have an abortion. Your attempt to misdirect responsibility to men is in vain and unfounded.
@elizabeth_ra_st In addressing your other points.  How many of these fathers never knew?  How many never got a say? I hear from fathers every week whose child was adopted out,  aborted,  or kept from them.  I assure you,  they find no comfort in that outcome.
@elizabeth_ra_st It certainly comes from a place of anger and pain.  I've literally lost years of time with my children that I can never get back while simultaneously being labeled a deadbeat because I cant pay a woman $30k a year in child support.  It's time the discussion was elevated.
@DahkotaRolling The men that have been unknowingly "absolved" of providing for their aborted and adopted out children without their knowledge and or consent are typically devastated.  It's not sexist.  It's pointing out the hypocrisy of those that call us deadbeats and to keep it in our pants.
Millions of children have been aborted,  adopted out,  and dropped off using Safe Haven laws. In each instance a woman can instantly absolve herself of 100% financial liability. Men are pursued with fire and pitchforks if they do not pay child support. Is this equality?

@susanpag65 People do not realize how bad many of these courts truly are.  There is tremendous lack of oversight and accountability.  I haven't had a day with my daughter in nearly a year.  I committed no crime and am not a threat.  It was reprisal for speaking out against the court.

@tkamins123 The judges job isn't to decide who the better parent is.  Their job is to protect the natural rights of the parents to raise their children.  If a parent hasnt been found unfit and is within reasonable distance of the child,  50/50 should be the order.
I wonder if you cared about these children when Obama was deporting them? What about when Obama was dropping missles through their front doors overseas?

@parentnotavisit I don't disagree with that.  Sadly over 85% is happening to fathers.
There is a national emergency.  It's been here for decades.  Congress is filled with charlatan,  elitist,  criminal,  shitbricks that choose special interest,  corporate payoffs,  and loony tune ideology over the American People.  Purge Congress and Save America!
@Billlee55453517 That's speculation in this scenario.  We don't know the circumstances or if there was even someone present that could have helped prevent it.
@DavidDangler Which is greater.  Time spent with the children being a father or time spent making more money to give to the mother? Do kids remember what pair of shoes they received on their 7th birthday or do they remember the time spent making the memory?
@SheaTycho @justjess1776 Society hails single motherhood as brave and even incentivizes it.  A poor single mom struggling to make ends meet has a wealth of government resources to help her provide for her kids. A poor non custodial father that is struggling gets jail.
@JudithM96921275 Children are at far greater risk in the care of the mothers new man.  Another reason why fathers should have far more time with their kids when the parents separate.
This is where i was born and raised. Breaks my heart. Of all days for her to be shot and killed,  it had to be on Law Enforcement Appreciation Day.  I hope the killer is brought to justice very soon.  		https://t.co/iExXuxJcTu
@Cremecheez1 I concur with that.  Did you know that states also receive Federal subsidies out of Title IV d of the Social Security act when they impose and collect a child support order? These incentives steer judges away from awarding equal custody decisions.
@SheaTycho @BryanESmithJr @rowen316 That is incorrect.  According to a 2016 https://t.co/Ni9xb0XhGg survey,  nearly 69% of children under 18 live with their married parents.
@SheaTycho @justjess1776 So you don't consider a child having access to their father less than 20% of the year harmful? If you had 50/50 custody a parent will miss out on 9 years of their child's life from birth to 18. While child support was intended to recover welfare expenses,  it was expanded to all.
@ShannonKetcher2 Do you have evidence to refute his experience as a family has attorney?
This is a compelling point. https://t.co/Nc3doACmqv
Which is a greater threat? A fact you may not know is 20 mil children are growing up without their biological father.  Family courts are a prominent driver.  When fathers are involved we have fewer dropouts,  less crime,  less welfare,  fewer abortions,  less drug abuse.  #dads2
If a fit and loving father lives near his children and wants to do half the work,  why are family courts predominantly awarding every other weekend? Don't we want fathers helping more? This is what child support should be.  Not a paycheck. https://t.co/RjU9v6cXpZ

I must disagree with my fellow veteran on this.  By no means am I an isolationist but we have millions living in poverty ,  unaffordable healthcare,  a broken immigration system, and 8,000 vets a year commiting suicide. It is time to put Americans 1st. https://t.co/gkWD7DaAq7

Yep,it has nothing to do with the ineptness of Democrats, no blame for HRC for rigging the primary against Bernie, has squat to do with the relics in Congress, no blame at all for those that sat out the election.  Thank you for participating in Moron Monday. You are in the lead. https://t.co/hUTqgeYVUZ
@shannondfrost That's a classless act unless the girl makes the suggestion.  Even then I doubt I would do it.  I took my fiance on a motorcycle ride through the mountains and had lunch in a quaint mountain town for our 1st date.
@lad1121 They're called volunteers for a reason.

@AmericanPNut As long as you got a smile out of it.
That's a lot of misogyny going on.  Truth be known it's a strong tactical move.  My ex-wife monitored our bank account like a CIA analyst and the day I had lunch at Hooters,  she called my check card and credit card in as being stolen.  I was just supporting some single moms. https://t.co/VlvTBWw1dS
@leading_quotes @RhianFazzini_28 Thank you so much for that.
@MrGQ37 @charliekirk11 No I didn't.  I presented further information on one of the specific planks listed.  Just as if I said the drug war is a failure and is the predominant driver of violence.  End the war on drugs.
This gives me hope for our nation's future. https://t.co/t3PX4euuMl
@worldbefree_99 Well if you used the historical makeup of the lying,  cheating,  deceitful ways of Congress I guess not.
@Elizabe04422361 I'm very sorry for your loss.  I know words are of little comfort.  I have now lost 7 friends and shipmates to suicide.
I lost another friend and shipmate two days ago.  While I do not know if he committed suicide,  I do know he struggled with PTSD and depression.  This is real.  It's happening and we cannot ignore it.  I don't have all the answers but I have some solutions I believe would help. https://t.co/LB5TOjaOib
@worldbefree_99 She's a veteran and one that works very hard to help other Veterans.  Am I missing something?
I would certainly support this great woman and patriot.  Hell yes @codeofvets you should run. https://t.co/oOwAIl6fkg

@ninjaswat That I can agree with.
I like how you left out clean water. https://t.co/HeHwzQhvr2
@TyLang06 @realDonaldTrump I disagree.  I think an America 1st Agenda means helping to solve complex problems that states like Michigan have failed to do.  If we can build infrastructure and make improvements on foreign soil,  we can do it here.
@GmahoganyX @markandersonsj1 @charliekirk11 If DCFS is operating as it should then why is turnover so high? If you're saving children then why do so many leave the profession?
@GmahoganyX @markandersonsj1 @charliekirk11 I meant it in the regard that you did your job.  I wasn't trying to patronize you.  Like many other things in life I believe plenty go into it for the right reasons.  I'm concerned with those doing it for malicious ones.
@GmahoganyX @markandersonsj1 @charliekirk11 I work with many groups and individuals that are seeking to reform DCFS.  Sorry but I've seen way to many cases of children wrongly removed,  not removed when they should have been,  and not given to family that were fit.  You may have been a model employee but I have no trust.
@GmahoganyX @markandersonsj1 @charliekirk11 I have no doubt that many children are rightfully removed and I am not refuting those.  I am refuting you with the countless cases of missing kids,  those raped, murdered,  and tortured. I can post links to these cases all day long.
@GmahoganyX @markandersonsj1 @charliekirk11 All 70?
@ninjaswat @Hermoso1 Oh I know exactly what it is.  Ridiculous property taxes and corrupt politicians are the predominant drivers.  Illinois citizens are sick of it.  Theyre flooding out of the state and rightfully so.
If @realDonaldTrump really wants to shut down that MotherFu@$er in Michigan he will continue troop withdrawal from other nation's and allocate the funding to fix the Flint,  Michigan water that Democrats have failed to do in the last five years.  #MAGA
@ninjaswat @Hermoso1 Apparently it is the latter.
@smerconish , The comments by @RepJerryNadler hit the nail on the head. "It's too early to speak intelligently" about impeachment articles.  He clarified because he didn't want to appear divisive. Normal political rhetoric.
@GmahoganyX @markandersonsj1 @charliekirk11 I can pull these all day long.  I haven't pulled the data but I would venture to say that if I did the budget has expanded exponentially in the last 20 years.  Children are big business. 		https://t.co/YG9giwFnbl
@faithaknew @silver_fox9 Well I'm a sailor and I embody that old adage.  I'm not mad at her language.  I have a switch though.  There's a time and place for everything.  In the presence of children would not be a place I would say that.
@niewiad7 @RhianFazzini_28 Thanks for your support brother.  They didn't like that 1st taste on NBC live so they avoided me at the @chicagotribune and the ABC debates.  Illinois elected a coward for Governor.
I don't give a damn if @TSA agents call in sick.  I was robbed in @Ohare airport in 2015. TSA agents didn't help me at the security checkpoint despite me pleading and pointing at the suspect.  I caught the bastard in baggage claim, put him on his knees,  and got my shit back.
@ChelLogan12 @charliekirk11 It's systemic.  DCFS,  CPS,  State Courts,  Public Schools,  etc.  I was very specific when I tweeted about the funding through Title IV E of the Social Security Act which goes to state orgs like DCFS.
Watching @JohnSarbanes get worked on CNN.  Tell me Congressman how you're OK with a fence but not a wall? You spoke out both sides of your mouth.
@ninjaswat @Hermoso1 I got into the 1st debate.  I believe I was kept out of subsequent debates because of my success in the initial one.
@ChelLogan12 @charliekirk11 I did say the government.
@ninjaswat @Hermoso1 I got on the ballot with nearly 10x what a Republican or Democrat needed.  We turned in nearly 48k petition signatures.  There is still much work to do in convincing America that we need established 3rd parties.
@ninjaswat @Hermoso1 I will agree in part and disagree in part.
@denny_rego Well I personally just spent 20 years in the Navy followed by 18 months of campaiging for governor in Illinois.  I'm taking my licks.  Illinois hasn't had enough punishment apparently so they elected another billionaire democrat.
@KristySwansonXO @KevinHart4real Amen.  I believe many in Hollywood are seeing the leftist trap exactly for what it is.  Those brave enough to challenge that find themselves ostracized and often times black balled but there is no substitute for being true to yourself. I hope he sticks to his guns.
@RhianFazzini_28 What about Randy Hultgreen?
@markandersonsj1 @charliekirk11 I disagree.  Most of them are stolen right here at home by child protective services that have entirely to much power which is financed by tax payers through the Social Security Act that I mentioned.
@lad1121 Oh here we go with the,  "stop harassing women". Actually you're harassing me so kick rocks lady.
@ninjaswat You can't be serious?
@Cataphract @charliekirk11 Yes.  If it is right in our country and financed by unsuspecting tax payers.
Done. https://t.co/hXU4EYIB5r
@charliekirk11 The largest sex trafficking ring is within the state government and apparently Catholic Church.  See Child Protective Services funded through Title IV E of the Social Security Act.  States have a financial incentive from federal funding to remove children from their homes.
@FreeSpeechJim I was more PC when I ran for governor.  I'm a sailor at heart so being PC isn't in my  DNA.  I will call out whatever I see whether it's on the right,  left,  or middle.  I lean left on several things but this shit is killing my soul.

Let's presume a wall becomes reality. Could it's use be reversed?  Let me remind you that Americans hung blacks,  scalped natives,  and treated women like 2nd class citizens.  65 MIL voted for HRC.

@SanjMohip It's extremely petty to do that.  She's got an entire list of nonsense she can be criticized for.
@JasonKeller88 @WalshFreedom I believe a better starting point would be deconstructing the welfare state. If there is no system to rely upon or cheat then it makes it less lucrative and desirable to immigrate illegally.  I believe there are many options unexplored.
It will be interesting to see where this goes. https://t.co/tirmUMtuyx
@Oahu_808 @WalshFreedom 1. If that's the most b.s. political answer you've ever heard let me welcome you into the world.  Youre advanced for a new born.  	2. There was no emotion.  Those were facts.  They don't care about your feelings.   3. It's still an answer even if you don't like it.
@WCIA3Mark @SenatorDurbin @CNN If only you could see my shocked face.
@Oahu_808 @WalshFreedom How extreme of an instance would you care to revisit in our nation's history? Mere poor financial compensation all the way down to marching thousands of natives west while they perished in the most heart wrenching and vile circumstances. Sorry, the end doesn't justify the means.
@WalshFreedom How do you propose that is done without taking American citizen's land by force or threat of force using eminent domain?
Clear the scum bags out. Lord,  how the hell the Feds haven't rounded up half the state is beyond me.  Hope Ole Mikey Madigan packs his shit too.

@sie2sienna @DFost14 I believe that begins with ending the Department of Education.
The greatest threats to freedom in the U.S. is apathy and ignorance.  In 2019 I pray for a better educated America, a nation that understands individual rights and respect for others right to live differently.  A nation that knows their rights and has the balls to defend them.
@KristatheYoung1 It's not easy defending liberty.  We make enemies on all sides.

@StefanMolyneux What many fail to see is the billions in financial incentives by way of Title IV D of the S.S. Act.  20 million children growing up absent their biological father is a result of feminist doctrine and the allure of federal dollars to pad state coffers.
@StefanMolyneux I'm surprised you didn't offer the solution of the single mother not playing gate keeper while being supported in her alienation tactics by state courts.  If 50/50 equal shared parenting were a norm and not an exception I feel certain the child's success would increase.
@KristatheYoung1 @Intelligencia76 I love the dialogue.  I do not doubt that there is a solution to this complex problem without resorting to taking private property.  This is one area of the Constitution that I do not like.
@ZenMaster333 I respectfully disagree.  Right now you have a private citizen that has raised millions voluntarily for the wall. No force or threat of force was required.  To often we subscribe to tradition instead of possibility.
I must disagree with the utmost enthusiasm.  Government is comprised of a body of people that collectively represent the interest of the individual.  Government's purpose is to protect the rights of the individual up to and including property rights.  Eminent domain is immoral. https://t.co/Oe0KKRBR2S
I don't give a damn what your experience is.  You've shown you do not care if your children have a father by playing gate keeper.  That puts you squarely with the other narcisstic and sociopathic nutjobs that will harm children to get at someone.  		https://t.co/lTLkrwGEMh

This is the boldest and bravest decision that I have seen out of a Commander and Chief in my lifetime.  This goes against that military industrial complex.

Yet our judicial system pries our children from us and treats us like criminals.  Why is that an American standard that is widely accepted? I'm only good enough for my money but not my love. https://t.co/aHgl6JvlG5
@jamesbluejohn What are you talking about? No where did I say it was acceptable to use the judicial system to bury someone for their religious beliefs.  There is a difference in these.  There are many bakeries a person could choose to go to.  There are not many twitter style platforms.
@jamesbluejohn There isn't much difference.  I'm free to go or I can also use public pressure since this is the only platform of its kind.  I think that I can believe in both simultaneously.  Unlike a bakery where there are many choices,  there is only one platform like Twitter.
As a libertarian I believe Twitter has the right to do what it will with the platform.  But I also believe in free market consumer pressure.  They may not change their ways but we can sure let them know it's gonna be bad for business. https://t.co/ngyCXlvDsY

@Ghost54601621 Unlike me? I guess that 20 years in the military doesn't count.
@dbongino Keep in mind the nearly 20 million children that will wake up with no father present including many children of Veterans.  Then remember that much of this is because of our shitty family court system that sees us as dollar signs and not parents.
@thatritahaley Where are you an attorney at?
@KristatheYoung1 @TheOnlyOtoha I don't know.  He's withdrawing troops,  stopping the subsidizing of military defense for other nations, legalized hemp nationally, right to try laws, etc... So there's some nuggets of gold in there.

@rynofied @FlynDutchman466 Let me entertain your proposition.  Tomorrow JB bans AR 15s in Illinois.  How many gun deaths will be prevented in 2019 based on a statistical average of annual murders committed using an AR 15 over the last 20 years in Illinois.
@rynofied @FlynDutchman466 Well you're clearly not a fan of the President so I want to clarify that you support his decision to legalize hemp nationally?
@rynofied @FlynDutchman466 Youre cherry picking murders.  You can't argue that the majority of all gun related death is by handgun.  After you account for self inflicted the numbers are far lower.  These are tools used.  What are the precursors to violence?
@rynofied @FlynDutchman466 I'm presuming that since you support cannabis that you also support hemp?
@rynofied @FlynDutchman466 @ladyjanekane1 @thecjpearson @TheAtlantic Why not handguns? There is no rationale to your reasoning.  Secondly,  as my fellow libertarian points out.  These are not assault weapons.  Assault is a verb and not an adjective.  If I throw my show at you I assaulted you.  It doesn't mean Nike makes Assault Shoes.
@rynofied @FlynDutchman466 @ladyjanekane1 @thecjpearson They are not seeking office at this time but they have a far more socialist approach.  They are the minority in our party and are more radical.  I also do not align with the pure anarchist which are also the extreme.  We have a wide umbrella.That doesn't mean we adopt their ideas
@rynofied @FlynDutchman466 @ladyjanekane1 @thecjpearson @TheAtlantic Can you tell me how many people were killed in Chicago with an AR 15 in the last ten years and then how many were killed with knives and hands.
@rynofied @FlynDutchman466 @ladyjanekane1 @thecjpearson There are many in my party that I would not and do not support in their positions.
@rynofied @FlynDutchman466 @ladyjanekane1 @thecjpearson Nope.  Sure don't.  I'm surprised that you do.  That's the difference in you and I.  I support individuals.
@rynofied @FlynDutchman466 @ladyjanekane1 @thecjpearson There was entire graphic in that tweet that shows multiple issues where we align with the left.  We could discuss any of those which refutes your points.
@rynofied @FlynDutchman466 @ladyjanekane1 @thecjpearson I've been an avid supporter of Representative LaShawn Ford who is now running for mayor of Chicago.
@rynofied @FlynDutchman466 @ladyjanekane1 @thecjpearson I wouldn't spend a penny on VAWA.  It's discriminatory and a cottage industry that functions by perpetuating allegations with low standards of proof.  Countless men's lives ruined because of that act.
@rynofied @FlynDutchman466 @ladyjanekane1 @thecjpearson You realize my running mate was a lifelong Democrat.  What you fail to understand is our ability to find compromise by respecting individual rights.  Agreeing to disagree and respecting another person's right to live how they want to as long as they don't hurt other people.
@rynofied @FlynDutchman466 @ladyjanekane1 @thecjpearson Well,  no offense,  it's also the same as you saying that Libertarians are just like Republicans. It's incorrect.  But in fairness,  major Democrats did support a wall at one time.  Until the President began pushing the issue.
@rynofied @FlynDutchman466 @ladyjanekane1 @thecjpearson Not unless Im convinced otherwise.  There is a strong argument for having a secure border and the functionality of a physical barrier.  Then again there are countless tunnels and ladders.  I'm not an open border person.  I believe we should vett people coming into America.
As always,  I will support the President when I think he is correct on an issue.  I completley agree with him here. https://t.co/BEt3JvMY3o
@rynofied @FlynDutchman466 @ladyjanekane1 @thecjpearson I think it's obvious what his point is.  Clearly we align on certain issues with both parties which eviscerates your position that we're just like Republicans.
@rynofied @FlynDutchman466 @ladyjanekane1 @thecjpearson Wait a second.  He doesn't agree with you so you can no longer have dialogue? He provided facts as to why he doesn't support that.  Do you have data to refute him?
@rynofied @FlynDutchman466 @ladyjanekane1 @thecjpearson I do not support banning the AR 15 or any other semi auto rifle or high capacity magazine.
@rynofied @FlynDutchman466 @ladyjanekane1 @thecjpearson No,  I'm not for a wall.  I have stated many times that the wall could be used differently depending on who is in power.  They can keep people in or out.  Not to mention the eminent domain that will certainly be used which violates private property rights.
@rynofied @FlynDutchman466 @ladyjanekane1 @thecjpearson Libertarians in general support free trade and freedom of movement.  You really should read our parties platform. You are extremely ignorant,  (no offense intended) as to what the libertarian party platform looks like.  Youre horribly mistaken.
@rynofied @FlynDutchman466 @ladyjanekane1 @thecjpearson Furthermore,  more citizens are killed by knife or someone's hands.  Shouldn't we prioritize and ban the most lethal weapon 1st.
@rynofied @FlynDutchman466 @ladyjanekane1 @thecjpearson Let me correct myself.  Youre actually correct in your statement that Libertarians rarely agree with democratic ideology.  It's the other way around.  Democrats began adopting libertarian philosophy when it became politically expedient.
@rynofied @FlynDutchman466 @ladyjanekane1 @thecjpearson I disagree.  Let's begin with civil rights.  Libertarians supported a person's ability to marry whomever they choose since our founding.  The very 1st electoral vote cast for a woman was a Libertarian.
@rynofied @ladyjanekane1 @FlynDutchman466 @thecjpearson No.  I think that's what you want.  You are defensive.  You thrive on conflict.  Maybe because it's what you were raised in and around.  You don't realize life doesn't have to be about conflict.  Which is why I want to see what ideas you have.
@rynofied @ladyjanekane1 @FlynDutchman466 @thecjpearson Nope
@Texanarchist I wasn't gonna say it... 😂
@rynofied @ladyjanekane1 @FlynDutchman466 @thecjpearson Youre more capable than you're showing me.  I'm not going to insult you.  I'm genuinely interested in what you think.
You can dislike this man for voting against the wall funding but Im all for this guy.  The private citizen raising money for it is showing us it is possible to fund programs without taxation. https://t.co/CTpaRzpVGN
@rynofied @ladyjanekane1 @FlynDutchman466 @thecjpearson Please enlighten me.  What does Ryan Weems propose to curb poverty, violence,  drug,  gangs,  abortion? Do you have an ounce of intelligence in your body beyond watching How to Troll tutorials on you tube.
@rynofied @ladyjanekane1 @FlynDutchman466 @thecjpearson Here is an example of a person that cannot make any sound arguments so he stoops to the lowest level possible by invoking someone's children into the conversation.  Congratulations.  You win the I have no life award.
@rynofied @ladyjanekane1 @FlynDutchman466 @thecjpearson Hi,  my name is Ryan Weems. I lack a personal life and have no desire to seek self improvement.  I only find fulfillment by trolling private citizens.  Women do not desire me,  I have no real life to speak of, much less any ambition so I will die in a blaze of glory on twitter.
@rynofied @ladyjanekane1 @FlynDutchman466 @thecjpearson You've clearly shown over and over,  your goal is not to have meaningful discussion and exchange of ideas/solutions but to incessantly troll until someone blocks you.  You have some deep seated issues that I suggest you seek counseling for.  I know a good therapist. #deranged
@ninjaswat @GLPatriot @realDonaldTrump I can agree on several of those points.  What solutions do you propose to end violence?
@BABuzzkill No,  they do not factor in the non custodial  parents living expenses.  I fell in the old model.  In sum total I am supposed to pay my ex nearly 34k a year. Keep in mind she makes nearly 100k a year if not more by now.
@rynofied @ladyjanekane1 @FlynDutchman466 @thecjpearson You Democrats seem to not understand that the Constitution protects you from government infringement of citizens rights, not private citizens.  You have no 1st Amendment Right on my page.  It's a luxury.  Youre able to reply here because I permit it.
@rynofied @ladyjanekane1 @FlynDutchman466 @thecjpearson I'm not trolling you genius.  Youre on my page.  Not yours.  Mine.
@rynofied @ladyjanekane1 @FlynDutchman466 @thecjpearson Lol.. You love that triggered word.  Again,  you're on my page.  Not the other way around.  It's like being in my house and saying I can leave whenever I want.  Clearly you are the triggered individual.
@rynofied @FlynDutchman466 I never did and still do not hope for its failure.  I do want people like you to get exactly what you asked for.  Because you asked for it.
@rynofied @ladyjanekane1 @FlynDutchman466 @thecjpearson Well,  I'm not running for office so you're just trolling another citizen.  As a political candidate it's expected.
@rynofied @ladyjanekane1 @FlynDutchman466 @thecjpearson So by your definition, youre triggered.  You keep commenting to my post.  This is another definition you should look up.  See narcissist as well as gas lighting.
@rynofied @FlynDutchman466 I see that as the outflux picks up steam.  Please see Websters definition of dillusional.
@rynofied @ladyjanekane1 @FlynDutchman466 @thecjpearson Great as hominem response.  Nothing to truly debate so you use my previous relationships.  That's an 8th grade response.  Is that your highest level of education?
@rynofied @ladyjanekane1 @FlynDutchman466 @thecjpearson It's funny you say triggered.  Thats a nice buzzword for people that think they're actually irritating someone.  If you irritated me I would block you.  You troll me,  not the other way around.  It shows you have either a keen interest in me or you're attracted to me.
@rynofied @FlynDutchman466 How many people left Illinois the last 10 years? Yep,  keep being patient.  Democrats will figure it out eventually.  Lol..
@rynofied @ladyjanekane1 @FlynDutchman466 @thecjpearson Lol.. OK.  The same for all those dads in those neighborhoods you love so much.  My work is for them as well.  My work would help lower poverty,  crime,  welfare,  etc... So keep making snide remarks.  I at least work to change it.  I've seen nothing from you except trolling.
@rynofied @ladyjanekane1 @FlynDutchman466 @thecjpearson To clarify I don't know that I followed you.  It's possible but in all likelihood it was the fella that managed my twitter during the campaign.
@ninjaswat @realDonaldTrump Please explain where you got religion or Trump supporter out of this conversation because it was never stated until you tweeted it.
@rynofied @ladyjanekane1 @FlynDutchman466 @thecjpearson Have to debate later.  I have ducks to kill.
@gunjinn_ So you think a person can lose half their income overnight and not fall behind? Try again.  More google.
@rynofied @ladyjanekane1 @FlynDutchman466 @thecjpearson Actually it doesnt.  I spent 23cents per vote.  JB spent $72 per vote.  But keep telling yourself those lies.  Let me know how much better East St Louis is after your Bilionaire democrat is done.
@rynofied @ladyjanekane1 @FlynDutchman466 @thecjpearson It's remarkable you still follow me.  Do you do it just to be an antagonist? I mean I don't mind because I enjoy debating.  We can debate guns.  I'm getting ready to go use one.  Using my semi auto shotgun as a responsible gun owner.  I've owned guns since I was 12 or 13.
@rynofied @ladyjanekane1 @FlynDutchman466 @thecjpearson I don't need to fool you.  Apparently someone already has.
@rynofied @ladyjanekane1 @FlynDutchman466 @thecjpearson CJ is far more intelligent than than loon.  You can't be serious.
@gunjinn_ You saying I'm a deadbeat doesn't make me a deadbeat.  Because deadbeats don't fight to be in their kids lives.  Deadbeats don't spend 50k fighting to be a dad.  Deadbeats don't pick their kids up 3 days a week and offer to do it 5 days a week. #moron #cantfixstupid #numbnuts
@javajnkie I've said several times that I'm a feminist.  If we're talking about the original feminist.  The feminist of today are a dramatic departure from those of yesteryear.
@ninjaswat @davidhogg111 He's not fighting for freedom.  He is fighting to restrict others freedoms.  If he wanted to truly address gun violence, he would talk about the drivers.  Because inanimate objects do not commit violence.  People do.
I was wrong.  White privilege does exist.  See example "A". https://t.co/4sAA7CAAjq
@RealCandaceO @charliekirk11 Are you guys getting hitched? Forgive my ignorance if you're both in a relationship or married.
@heustons I know.  I have seen many,  many parents in Australia,  Canada,  UK,  and other nation's deprived of their natural rights the same as here.
@Ghost54601621 Please elaborate how it was my choice to be treated like a criminal.
@Ghost54601621 So you support the denial of human rights? Please tell me... Are you fascist or communist?
In 1948 a fathers role was valued.  In 2018 I must teach my sons the only value they have to America is paying taxes for Unconstitutional wars that they will likely serve in to be cast aside and treated like a criminal when you return.  #ourwarneverends https://t.co/6yO6qj3PR1
This is what child support looks like.  When America wakes up and realizes the most important contribution fathers can 	make is being involved and raising our children then we will see a decline in violence,  poverty,  teen pregnancy,  drug abuse,  and other social ills. https://t.co/nmDq3yaOam
@Pissnofflibera1 A perfect world of disillusionment.  It never ceases to amaze me the sheer volume of ignorance.  He says "real men financially support their children". Guess those poor fathers aren't real men in his eyes.  I guess all of my bills are free and I don't pay those.
Here we have a prime example of what brainwashed society believes.  This not so bright fella believes like feminist on the left.  "Just pay your support". Never once questioning if the non custodial has a house payment,  utilities,  food,  car,  insurance... https://t.co/f8DpmkCDDu
@gunjinn_ I love when people like you pop up and flood the public sphere with your ignorance.  #1 Paid over 100k in child support.  #2 Reenlisted for 6 yrs in the Navy to transfer college benefits to my kids.  #3 Did 20 yrs in Navy so kids would have continuous health care.  #Ignorant
@FletchReflected @CliffShep @TRUMPMOMENTS411 @LakeCountyIL I wasnt in jail for 5 months.  I was jailed 5 months after retiring.  I told the judge that as long as he keeps the support order so high that I can't pay my bills that he will have to keep incarcerating me.  People raised the $3k purge to get me out.  That's their game.
@TRUMPMOMENTS411 @CliffShep @LakeCountyIL It's still going.  I relocated to Arkansas because I was drug to court over 100 times.  I fought to be more involved as a dad and raise my kids.  They fought to demonize me and rob me of every cent I ever made.  Because I moved without their permission, they cut off all contact.
@truth_nowplease @OwenWarland That's an understatement.  I have suffered reprisal after reprisal because I speak out against the Lake County Circuit Court and the judges and attorneys involved.  This isn't an isolated case.  It's systemic across all civilized society.
@Rush1776Rush It is a system designed by lawyers to financially benefit lawyers and the state.  It's an adversarial system designed to maximize conflict so that scum bag attorneys can rob you of your life savings and kids college funds.
@CliffShep @TRUMPMOMENTS411 I was jailed 5 months after retiring from the Navy.  20 years of honorable service to then be rewarded with debtors prison by @LakeCountyIL. They care about their citizens about as much as the Somoli government cares about theirs.
@truth_nowplease @OwenWarland I've more than backed up my experience with information.  It's not all on twitter.  Not hard to find.  Just use that google search engine.
@OwenWarland I wasted $50k fighting to just be an involved father,  the child support order was set to take over 40% of my income causing me to fall ten's of thousands behind. After retiring from the Navy the judge did not feel that a $1k plus a month income drop warranted a modification.
@OwenWarland In 2014 before my divorce began I had frequent contact with my kids even though I was a couple thousand miles away.  Now the gate keeper, otherwise known as mom does not permit contact.  I saved nearly $100k and had no debt with an 815-820 credit score.
I retired from the Navy 2 yrs ago.  I have been systematically alienated from my children and bankrupted by the American Judicial System.  The greatest threat to my freedoms has come from within.  I would gladly fund a wall between citizens and the tyrants in Family Court. https://t.co/bAgWiv2kVt
@quentinking46 @RagingGayCons We create more terrorist than we eliminate.  I believed the same as you at one time so I don't hold it against you.  It is time we reformed our way if thinking and our foreign policy.
@RagingGayCons It's way overdue.  America first means eliminating our national debt,  ending homelessness,  having affordable health care,  and not creating more Wounded Warriors that we don't take care of.  These perpetual wars and Unconstitutional conflicts must end.
Guess Mad Dog is mad about the Syria call by the President.  		https://t.co/aOYAYX6PtV
@seanomac1974 Trans child or not,  they're still children.  Children think many things but it doesn't mean we give them the extreme latitude of deciding for themselves.  You fully educate the child,  equip them with as much knowledge as humanly possible,  and let them decide as adults.
@seanomac1974 Are you?
I wouldn't have claimed we defeated them but that's just me. I would say America is reevaluating her national defense subsidy program and that we will no longer provide defense for the world.  We will prioritize Americans,  end homelessness &amp; poverty,  and eliminate our debt. https://t.co/grM7UiAm3o
@bsj968 You mean the science that says you can't change your chromosomes.
@AskTimmyH @PPFA Please enlighten me.
@missidawest That one as well.
@creamy_meme Don't take my statement out of context.  I was clear in what specific situation I was referring to.
I think a go fund me for the wall is a great idea.  We could also apply similar methods for planned parent hood. Don't force people to pay for things they are morally opposed to.  Is there a free market solution to the eminent domain that most certainly will be utilized?
@missidawest That was what prompted my tweet.
The libertarian in me says that if a man or woman wants to live as the opposite sex,  have at it.  That freedom does not expand to a child that cannot understand basic concepts such as sex,  gender,  etc.  An adult supporting this in a child is guilty of child abuse.
RT @opREDPILL: We are being heard, and they are trying to change that by suppressing the videos. Not knowing true views or impressions on o…
@rynofied Well you could be the first.  I believe in not waiting for someone else to do that which you are fully capable.
@Inthecountry2 @rynofied Ryan believes us to be one in the same.  I respectfully disagree with him.
@JCB_Journo @WCIA3Mark Oh if you only knew....
This is what happens when you vote based on a color or letter.  It seriously amazes me that so many lack the principles or virtue to vote for someone based upon their character and platform. We have dumbed down politics to the extent that a child in elementary school could vote. https://t.co/u70McNiMYx
@ZenMaster333 They don't drive it but they sure contribute to it.  Lol... If we were to have a more in depth discussion we could then discuss the adverse health effects due to poor eating habits compared to lower blood pressure,  increased appetite for eating disorders,  pain management,  etc.
@mikeyj4460 @1980reagan @DanProft @ShaunfromEP @DanProft didn't care for my position on immigration.  I wish we could have had a more in depth discussion but alas,  I knew the struggles of running 3rd party.  It was a better option than joining the ranks of so many pretending to be Republicans.
Prosecuting this man and seizing these goods hurts the economy.  Do you have any idea how many dozens of donuts and Little Debbie snacks would have been purchased by citizens with the munchies? Not to mention the gallons of gas used in springing for some Double Cheeseburgers. https://t.co/XGanmCBLdg
I couldn't agree more. https://t.co/N8h2PE0Z9E
Finally.  Now if we can stop interfering in every other nations business,  end national defense subsidizing,  and bring troops home we will begin righting the lopsided ship known as foreign affairs. https://t.co/y9yWUZnt16
@THEJessAllen We've got the same or similar drug laws and it doesn't stop that either.
@Rambobiggs Our human traffickers are right here at home.  Title IV funding is their revenue stream.  See Kansas as an example and the hundreds of children taken from parents using a very low standard of evidence. Then the state merely misplaces them.
I don't know much but if I had to guess,  a Delta or a Seal knows what this guy's eating every morning for breakfast.  I wonder if he's ever seen what a round from a. 338 Lapua or. 50 does to a human head.  He might get his 1st look, albeit he will only have. 000000000001 seconds https://t.co/Fo0nL1mym7
@KristatheYoung1 I think it's a stretch to say that the GOP is underwater with all people under 40. There appears to be a strong undercurrent of young people towards more conservative ideas.  While I'm libertarian and believe most people are,  the louder voice resides within established parties.
@rynofied Did I say we were those on the right are the only ones?
Got a veteran with a shit diagnosis.  Can we set some political differences aside and lift a brother up in prayers.  This we can unite on. https://t.co/rwsZTCmS0V

@rynofied Come on... Are you being disagreeable for the sake of being disagreeable.  Do you think I should have been under a QFD ban?
After having been censored during my campaign I am behind this 100%. Let's RT and make it known that we will not take that lying down. https://t.co/E9MYLj3QJ6
@rynofied You should have thought about that before you committed to opening your mouth.  I gave you time to get off work and make arrangements.  That is the respectful thing to do.
@rynofied You said name the time and place.  I gave it to you.
@rynofied Fayetville,  Arkansas Jan 2nd 12:00 pm
@rynofied What a lame try at trying to get under my skin. Social media has been a beautiful thing for cowards like you. You lack the testicular fortitude to say it to my face because you know you would be eating double cheeseburgers through a straw.
@PetiteNicoco This is what happens when everyone gets a 🏆
We should all be able to agree on this.  No matter who sits in that office.  I can tip my hat to that. https://t.co/XG4LQGGxuK
@rynofied Sure because it's not bad enough that many black fathers are incarcerated unable to make support payments but now you want to put them to death. Thank you for showing your true colors.  You are living up to Democrats historical beginnings.
@rynofied @erp2ride1 I'm not your tour guide.  Go join Lincoln Lobby.  Join IGOT.  Just yesterday I told you that I commented on Candace Owens tweet and called out anti Liberty laws that republicans have supported.
@rynofied @erp2ride1 But no one threatens freedom like the left.  They have that down to a science.
@rynofied @erp2ride1 I've called them out on anti Liberty laws which again you said I hadn't.  Another fact you conveniently missed.
@rynofied @erp2ride1 You may be right.  Because I will never advocate for taking people's rights.  I will not advocate for more taxes and more government control.  I will not advocate for turning law abiding citizens into felons and giving hardend criminals more rights.
@rynofied @erp2ride1 Let's see... Madigans shill who had over 1.5 million barely beat me. Yeah.. I'm crying myself to sleep.  You can't handle me shutting you down with facts every time can you.
These feminist wonder why no one wants to hear their nonsense.  This lady literally said its socially acceptable to rape a woman.  In what universe? Every man I know would be trying to neuter the rapist or pound their face into oblivion. https://t.co/QghCIHWsp4
@fox666ak @MsMollyRachael Miss Molly said, "It's socially acceptable to rape a woman". It's like 3 tweets up.
@rynofied @erp2ride1 Well I got endorsed by Black Lives Matter of Lake County so I'm closer to that end than you are to mine now aren't I?
That should have happened after we learned where the 9/11hijackers hailed from. https://t.co/iNjCEOwURe
@rynofied @erp2ride1 Maybe one day you will wake up and see that Democrats have been standing on your throat,  giving you just enough to survive.  I doubt it but I can hope for you.
@rynofied @erp2ride1 Had you been a member of Lincoln Lobby and IGOT you would have but you're in an echo chamber all day so you don't see it.
@Dkmorris0204 Tell that to countless men that thought they were going to be dads.  You think we're emotionless bottom feeders with no soul.  I have friends that were devastated and have never been the same.  Great sexist remark.
@rynofied @erp2ride1 So I'm not decent because I don't hold the same political views? Someone else had a similar mindset... Oh yeah... Stalin
@truth_nowplease I have one.  She says telling people how I feel is good therapy so I'm in session right now.
@rynofied @erp2ride1 I've always done that.  Not my fault you didn't pick up what I was putting down.
@MarkWil58 For the obvious.  It's well known and easy to find what happens.  Spewing idiotic garbage deserves a candid response.
@MsMollyRachael @fox666ak That's complete bullshit. You feminist kill me with these types of remarks.  No person in their right mind would condone rape.
@MsMollyRachael @RubeBait Really,  so the state shouldn't mandate a man use his body to produce income to subsidize lazy women? Guess I can agree with that.
@rynofied @erp2ride1 That's idiotic. Libertarians have done nothing to drive this nation 21 trillion in debt.  We have advocated for broader civil rights from our beginning.  Neither party can claim the same.
Helen Keller could have see this one coming.  Great job Mike Madigan and Democrats.  Would you do us all the honor of at least being honest enough to say you want Illinois to be the 1st apocalypse.  It's going down Mad Max style in the next 20 years.  Mark my words. https://t.co/NIaExDkq5S
@rynofied @erp2ride1 Let's see here.  I spent 20 years defending the Constitution to watch it trampled by morons.  What do you think.
@justinamash @WalshFreedom You're a damn good man Mr.  @justinamash . We need more like you in Congress.
@lgsawyer @justinamash I'm pretty certain thats exactly what he did.  He called out both.
@FreeSpeechJim I used that in one of my 2 minute speeches at a university in Illinois.  Actually I think I said I would pluck the chickens myself.
@FreeSpeechJim I'm libertarian in most of my beliefs.  Keep government honest if that even possible.  I don't care what side of the isle you hail from as long as you're not restricting others liberties that do not infringe on anothers rights.
@rynofied What's even more horrible is we are paying for this by way of Title IV funding of the Social Security act.
I would love to see the training that these judges receive.  These cases are prevalent.  Judge puts child in foster care instead of with family.  Child ends up molested,  raped,  beaten,  or murdered.  I have a feeling that a state's General Fund ends up a little larger. https://t.co/z8vSmczwzR

@rynofied Sure you will.  Until you've driven so many people out that it then becomes a desolate graveyard.  I want you to explain how Chicago and East St Louis have been in the condition they're in and have been for decades.  Controlled by Democrats.
@rynofied I'm sorry but the most lunatic shit I see comes out of the left.  The right isn't pushing for socialisim.  That is the left.
@rynofied What game genius? I still call out republicans for their ridiculous stances as well.  Their anti Liberty positions like cannabis,  regulating marriage,  corporate welfare,  Patriot Act so you can save it for your Echo chambers.
@rynofied Wrong again.  When Ocasio Cortez made statements that Congress should not have their ridiculous salaries with unpaid interns.  Most of the crap out of her mouth is idiotic but I agreed.  I'm so glad you got JB and a super majority in both houses.  Let me know how that works out.
@rynofied I had many from the left vote for me. So wrong again.  Maybe you should actually know what the hell you're talking about before opening your mouth.
@rynofied Maybe you missed the thread of me calling out Republicans as well yesterday.  Right on Candace Owens tweet.  So wrong again.
@rynofied I want you to please explain how Democrats have controlled the shit out of Illinois and it's in the crap condition it's in.  Let me guess,  Trump did it...
Hard to argue with that. https://t.co/OmWh3KJjDU
@lad1121 @Sixlets821 I think that is laughable.  Give me a break. You're anti Trump which is fine if that's your prerogative.  I don't want my President to fail whether he's Trump,  Obama,  or another.  I will run my page how I see fit.  I'm not telling you what to do with yours now am I.
@truth_nowplease @joe_warmington I will tell you what.  I'm willing to continue having dialogue with you on this issue but only if you're willing to discuss violence in all of our society.  Many of the same instigating factors that leads men to violence are the same ones that effect women.
@911pmsAnna How could I forget.
@CVaandering @MarsWolf It is past time for people to stand up and say enough.
@soniclore @RealCandaceO I'm not saying they're strictly Republican.  I'm saying that they're just as guilty of supporting these types of anti Liberty laws.  They're also guilty of large government. They share many characteristics.
@CVaandering @MarsWolf Violence should always be a last resort.
@lad1121 @Sixlets821 I've said this before.  The US is guilty of interfering in elections and instituting regime changes anytime it suited them.  If the chickens have came home to roost then so be it.  Maybe we will rethink our Foreign Intervention Policies.
@truth_nowplease @AvalonPilsen I suggest getting a gun,  some training,  and in the event that happens again you can send a very strong message.
@truth_nowplease @AvalonPilsen You have two polar extremes of insult and then you back away and state you're merely trying to understand.  You need to choose a personality and stick with it,  at least through the duration of the conversation.  I respond to the language used.

@jamesbluejohn @putzie63 Yes sir

@soniclore @RealCandaceO Criminalizing cannabis, Blue Sunday laws like no alcohol or car sales on Sunday's,  eminent domain,  corporate welfare, bump stock bans,  etc...
@RealCandaceO I love much of what you say and stand for but Republicans are not limited government in practice.  There are a few that are but they do not make the majority.  Further, they have passed some of the most restrictive and anti Liberty laws in our nation.  If we're honest.
@RodRescueman @gjzielinski The left has no issue with denying your humanity when you have a difference of opinion.  It's a character trait that existed in many leaders responsible for slaughtering other human beings.  See Hitler and Andrew Jackson.
@gjzielinski And he will be on another one before too long.  Stay tuned.
@truth_nowplease @KarenMo48691639 That I will agree with 100%. Have a great day.
@truth_nowplease @KarenMo48691639 I have.  The vast majority cited economic or inconvenience.  A couple stated medical reasons.
@truth_nowplease @KarenMo48691639 You're attempting to apply reasoning for a minority of abortions to the majority.  I acknowledge that rape happens and it is disgusting but this is a very small percentage.  Can you acknowledge that the vast majority have nothing to do with rape or incest?
@truth_nowplease @KarenMo48691639 May I remind you that in one of your previous tweets you asked me to list what men were needed for that women could not do.  You must get off the fence.  Do women need men or don't they?
@truth_nowplease @KarenMo48691639 Let's just deal with a smaller sample size in your home country. 		Homicide in 2016-611	Abortions in 2005-97,000		There are no restrictions on abortion.  Canada is one of only a few developed nations that permits the whole sale killing of children.Tell me again about violent men
@truth_nowplease @KarenMo48691639 There are a multitude of factors that influence violence.  Can you help me understand why there was and is an entire movement of women that have made it popular and glamorized chopping up an unborn child? Why is this celebrated?
@Pissnofflibera1 Throw it up.  Brings back some great memories.
@truth_nowplease @KarenMo48691639 I'm not the one tenaciously blaming a sex for all the woes of the world.
@truth_nowplease @KarenMo48691639 I think you have some deeper issues in regards to men that you are projecting because at each turn you refuse to acknowledge the systemic issues perpetuated by women as well.  I acknowledge both are equally guilty.  It's not just men.
@truth_nowplease @KarenMo48691639 I think you have bought into a great deal of phony narratives.  Here is a small sampling of that woman goodness. 	https://t.co/yNpXHalEDN
@truth_nowplease @KarenMo48691639 It's also not as simple as just saying men are evil.  Men have always been protectors and providers.  Without that where would we be as a race of beings? You give full view of negative and zero recognition of the positives.  Your nation as well as mine are a direct result of men.
@truth_nowplease @KarenMo48691639 Don't you think you would have more success in identifying and addressing the root causes of violence itself instead of singling out men? I have a theory.  Many of these men grow up in a single parent household absent their father and have displaced anger.  Children need dads.
@brittyknows @EricZorn Somehow people are attracted to the truth.
@EJMill @EricZorn I've been known to swoon a lady.
@EricZorn Awe... Eric came out to say hi.  If you care to have an actual debate on this issue feel free to step up.
@LivepdPolitics @Krm1285A Exactly!!
@not12x @truth_nowplease You quoted a mysterious person from mysterious body of government.  Could you at least put their name?
@truth_nowplease @KarenMo48691639 If you spend 20 minutes conducting research you will find children are more likely to be neglected and abused in the care of women,  fillicide occurs more with women yet men are prosecuted at greater rates.
@truth_nowplease @KarenMo48691639 It is perplexing that you use two very different descriptions for women rapist. There is no difference in exerting power and control whether one uses mental or physical in taking advantage of our youth.
@truth_nowplease @Pissnofflibera1 I would love to have that.  We may differ on how to get there but as long as we maintain a respectful dialogue I believe we can work towards that goal.
@truth_nowplease @Pissnofflibera1 There is no such thing as a trust worthy government. I have been severely harmed as have my children, by government which is why I ran for office.  In America you have a right to privacy.  It doesn't mean you have anything to hide.  It means my home is mine,  not government's.
@truth_nowplease @Pissnofflibera1 No but I did seek political office.  Sadly,  principles in politics are lacking and the best shot you have at being elected is being a billionaire.  I come from very humble beginnings and still live a very humble life.
@truth_nowplease @Pissnofflibera1 There is no such thing as a utopia but we are far safer than we have ever been.  That doesn't mean we shouldn't continuosly seek to improve.
@truth_nowplease @Pissnofflibera1 Government is the greatest contributors to human trafficking and death and you want them coming to your home for welfare checks? Do you know how insane that sounds?
@truth_nowplease @Pissnofflibera1 I have worked to push legislation that would clearly reduce poverty,  violence,  drug abuse,  abortion,  etc... The two groups who opposed it the most are Domestic Violence Groups and the Illinois Bar Association. Industries that profit enormously.
@PetiteNicoco Lol.. I can't even today.
@truth_nowplease @Pissnofflibera1 Because evil exist and no amount of legislation will ever rid us of evil.  Recognizing the root causes and taking steps to counter those is the best course of action.  I would begin with how many children are growing up absent their biological father due to state interference.
@truth_nowplease Wait a second... You said men have no value and then you call us sexist? Have you ever heard of the term "hypocrite"?
@truth_nowplease @Pissnofflibera1 Ummm... We already have legislation that protects every human being.  Are you saying we need legislation to tell people to abide by legislation?  How do you see that working out exactly?
See example "A" for hypocrisy and the desperate need for greater access to mental health services. https://t.co/qRMjiYMLvj
@truth_nowplease @Pissnofflibera1 Then you clearly have yourself isolated in an echo chamber.  Many of these pro life people that you claim don't give a shit,  end up adopting those children.  How many have you adopted?
@truth_nowplease I never stated that we didn't.  You asked me to provide examples of a males worth.  The best example of a man's worth looks right back at you every day in the mirror for without a man you would not be here.
@truth_nowplease @Pissnofflibera1 You base your position on "news stories". I could have an entire conversation about how terribly flawed that logic is.  What's more violent than destroying millions of unborn,  defenseless children.
@truth_nowplease In our simplest biological role, we continue the human species by way of our sperm.  I think that's pretty damn important.
@truth_nowplease We will always need men to do these things.  Evil does not just disappear.
@truth_nowplease By your statement I'm left to assume that you believe women do none of these things.  I'm not going to waste my time researching and sending you endless examples of women doing everyone of these. You know full well that they are guilty of them and punished to a far less degree.
There is nothing toxic about masculinity. What is toxic is a breakdown of men and boys and their inherent value to society.  We must stop with this overt attack unless we want our men defending this nation with dildos while wearing vagina helmets.	#sorrynotsorry #MenToo

@LadyCHI_94 @ProudPatriot3 You're correct.  My apologies.  I get them nearly equal from both sides of the isle.
@ProudPatriot3 I understand you perfectly. You're like every other hypocrite I've met whose actions contradict their self titles. You lack any facts with which to back your position and you resort to juvenile remarks further driving home my point for all to see.
@ProudPatriot3 Well I guess if I believed you to be a pedophile,  according to you I need no facts,  that only my mere belief in it could make it so.  Again you have adopted a common tactic from the left.  If you're a conservative patriot them I'm an albino camel.
@ProudPatriot3 I spent 20 years in military service.  So you can take your "Proud Patriot" bullshit and kick rocks.  Most "patriots" these days are sheep that don't know their ass from a hole in the ground.  You'll blindly follow any ignorant asshole that knows how to tickle your freedom toe.
@ProudPatriot3 I'm flipping through the Bible and I can't quite find the passage where Jesus says to hurl insults at someone simply because you disagree.  Can you narrow down the search...Maybe that's an Old Testament lesson I missed.  You and my ex must have the same Sunday school teacher.
I'm an idiot and this one is a hypocrite.  She sure loves her some Jesus but the hell with following his teachings.  Great job.  You're a fantastic example of why many on the right are as hypocritical as those on the left. https://t.co/HEN4zLyd7a
@ProudPatriot3 That is a fantastic ad hominem attack that is quite subjective which is what the left enjoys the most when they have no facts to substantiate their position. So now that you have your emotions out can you please try making an argument with facts.
How very libertarian of you @charliekirk11 . Spot on my friend. https://t.co/SxbFmgwJkM
@LexieLeMae I'm sorry for your loss. It is hard to deal with.
@Tsothoggua I urge you to reread that decision.  It is not applicable in all states.  The decision was rendered because of the wide latitude provided under California State Constitution,  not because the US is willing to infringe upon private property rights.  You're taking a socialist road.
@thejtlewis I have a great deal of respect for you which is why I must tell you that youre wrong.  Libertarians didn't put this nation 21 trillion in debt.  They also didn't trample the Constitution.  Do a little more research.
@Tsothoggua Agreeing with you when you're clearly wrong isn't doing you any service.  I'm an ally to freedom and liberty,  not the right or left.  If you're wrong,  you're wrong. Sorry not sorry.

@Tsothoggua In California.  Do you really want the rest of the nation to be like California?
@mikeyj4460 I've been shadow banned by twitter when I was running for governor so I know.  However,  a principled libertarian would not agree with you.  It's a private company.  Not owned by the public. They're free to run it as poorly as they choose.
@MYKIDSEZMOM Didn't say it wasn't.  Still isn't a 1A issue.
@Tsothoggua Actually,  no it isn't.  You referenced a case that was upheld because California's state  Constitution gives greater latitude.  This is not so in all 50 states under the US Constitution and their respective state Constitution.
Learn what the Constitution is intended for.  This is why you're losing your rights.  You don't even grasp the most basic concept of the purpose of the Constitution much less what Amendments there are.  Stop embarrassing yourselves and conservatives.

@forPritzker @ChelsieLeffel12 @allenskillicorn @SWB138 @jb_pritzker @DanProft @JeanneIves In 2015 86k people left this state. Most of them left because of high taxes. This translated to a loss in $4.75 billion annually in tax revenue. How many will leave this year? 100k???

@BasigerJerry @74stasha @cathibrgnr58 @BruceRauner Getting his seat would be pretty tough taking votes away from his though is something we can make happen. Then unseating him.
@BasigerJerry @74stasha @cathibrgnr58 @BruceRauner I'm not going to lie it's going to take a while to undo the damage that's been done to our state but I have both short term and long term plans to get us back on track.
@BasigerJerry @74stasha @cathibrgnr58 @BruceRauner Yes! We might not get his seat or maybe we will but we will at least take some away and also make the Republicans actually start trying in this state again.

@FyrFyter1 Yes my plan is to take his seats away which will take his power away. Republicans are only running in half of the races in Illinois. This doesn't address the issue of Madigan. Once our party is established we will run in every single race in two years.
@BasigerJerry @cathibrgnr58 @BruceRauner Spending will be cut drastically as well. We 7000 units of local government in Illinois. I will consolidate these units. This is about twice the number that Texas. A state that is much larger in size and population.
@BasigerJerry @cathibrgnr58 @BruceRauner I also plan to cut corporate taxes and cut unneeded regulations. In Illinois we had 86k people leave this state due to high taxes. This translated to a loss of $4.75 billion in tax revenue. We need to drastically lower taxes to bring people people amd businesses back to Illinois.
@BasigerJerry @cathibrgnr58 @BruceRauner I plan on lowering taxes across the board. First I'm aiming for a five year freeze on property taxes. Then I want to move to lowering all property taxes to 1% of the value of your home and that would be fixed.

Illinois has been downgraded by major credit rating agencies eight times since @BruceRauner took office. If he had his was he would intentionally bankrupt the state in order to make sure police, firefighters and other state workers don't get a pension. https://t.co/su7SeXVjfe
@JeanneInTexas @sherry50waldie @cjdtwit @SanjMohip @BruceRauner Oh he also did so much than that. He funded abortions, got our credit rating lowered several times, signed a gun grabbing bill into law and only fought passionately to take away the retirement funding of police and firefighters.

@coinoperator07 @Jamierodr10 @BruceRauner That's why once established after this race my party will run in all state races. Right now republicans only run in half of all of the state races. This is just letting boogie man Mike have all the power he wants. We will take seats away from the dems in the next election.
@BasigerJerry @cathibrgnr58 @BruceRauner @BruceRauner has done absolutely nothing to fight Mike Madigan. Anyone with a brain knows to beat him you must start taking seats away from him. At this point dems are 4 seats away from a 3/5 majority. Republicans are only running in half of the state races.
@BasigerJerry @cathibrgnr58 @BruceRauner The democrats are to blame for the pensions being unfunded. Screwing police, firefighters and state employees out of their retirement funds is beyond greasy. A real leader would find a solution to help solve the problem. How can you even defend that??
@Arch_Angel9999 @WhiteTricks There will be plenty of things I will be able to accomplish in my first two years as Governor as well. As it stands dems are 4 seats away from having a 3/5 majority. I blame Bruce for that.
@Arch_Angel9999 @WhiteTricks Actually my plan is to run candidates statewide. Wherever democrats run unopposed, we will be there to run against them. My whole plan is designed around taking power away from the democrats in Illinois. That's the first step towards fixing our state.
@Arch_Angel9999 @JimmyCoyoteLoco And again I'm the only candidate actually taking a good chunk out of his vote. If I wasnt in this race he would be above 50%. No democrat would be willing to vote for Bruce or Sam.
@Arch_Angel9999 @JimmyCoyoteLoco I'm actually taking a whole lot of democrats too. There's a reason why Pritzker's polling has been below 40%. Believe or not a lot of Democrats don't want to vote for a bigot who is anti union, cheats on his taxes and hides money in offshore accounts.
@Arch_Angel9999 @WhiteTricks Watch me...
@Arch_Angel9999 @WhiteTricks I actually have a plan to fight Madigan. Rauner is just an actor probably sent by the left.
@Arch_Angel9999 @WhiteTricks Then why didn't Rauner who has all of the money in the world spend it in the last election to take seats away from democrats instead of his own Republicans????
@Arch_Angel9999 @JimmyCoyoteLoco Rauner is not an R. He is more of a far left democrat.

@Arch_Angel9999 @JimmyCoyoteLoco Rauner never would have beat pritzker.
@Arch_Angel9999 @WhiteTricks Rauner is the reason Sam is running against him. Instead of using his money to try and take seats away from Dems last election he spent his money trying to get Sam out of office who was in his own party. Now Sam's on the ballot purely to get revenge. I'm here to win..
@Arch_Angel9999 @WhiteTricks Yea right! Rauner is more D than most people who are in the Democratic party. He made our state a sanctuary state, funded abortions with tax payer dollars, got our credit rating lowered, sign a gun grabbing bill into law and has wrecked our state.
@Arch_Angel9999 @WhiteTricks https://t.co/Y4T1mD5q3X

@MrSmithisready @salberg_a @harjo111 Republicans don't like our governor. He has a 24% approval rating.
@MrSmithisready @salberg_a @harjo111 This race is not about getting 5% though. We're well past that. We're in it to win it.
@MrSmithisready @salberg_a @harjo111 Once that happens we will have equal ballot access and it will be much easier for us to run in every race which we plan to do.
@MrSmithisready @salberg_a @harjo111 We have one county where we are established in Illinois. This thing about statewide races is that when someone gets 5% the party gets established throughout the whole state.
@BigPapa6172 @harjo111 @TheUnitedFree I actually have a plan to take power away from Mike Madigan.
@BigPapa6172 @harjo111 @TheUnitedFree Why not vote for me???
@MadMaga1 @baalter In order to take power away from Mike Madigan, we need to start taking seats in the statehouse. Republicans aren't even attempting to. Once the libertarian party is established we will have equal ballot access amd with it we will be able to run in every race in the state.
@MadMaga1 @baalter One good reason to vote for me is to establish the libertarian party in Illinois in order to take power away from democrats. As it stands Republicans are only running in half of the races. They aren't even trying to gain a majority.
@MadMaga1 @baalter There hasn't been a poll conducted in over a month and all polls before did not include my name in the polling question. My message has been spreading daily all I'm saying is don't be surprised Tuesday.

@mrgandhischlote @YouTube @SanjMohip @BruceRauner @JBPritzker By doing this we will have more competition and as a result democrats and republicans will be forced to raise the bar and actually fight for the people of Illinois.
@mrgandhischlote @YouTube @SanjMohip @BruceRauner @JBPritzker By establishing the libertarian party we will have equal ballot access and with it we will be able to run candidates in all state races. In order to take back power we must be able to end one party rule in Illinois.
@mrgandhischlote @YouTube @SanjMohip @BruceRauner @JBPritzker Our state is essentially controlled by one party. @BruceRauner claims that he fights this party and it's house speaker yet his party is only running candidates in half of the state races. A vote for me will establish the libertarian party.
@mrgandhischlote @YouTube @SanjMohip @BruceRauner @JBPritzker A vote for me is a vote 2 take back control of your state. As it stands our state has been bought out by special interests. Currently we have 2 billionaires trying 2 buy power and 1 candidate who is controlled by special interests. I'm the only 1 not backed by special interests.

@MikeRwk78 It's hard to really know where I stand in this race when none of the polls include my name in the polling questions. Even with that there have been 3 polls where the percentage of people who were undecided or not voting for JB or Rauner was larger than the leading candidate.
@MikeRwk78 And just think about how many people are doing the same thing. Don't count me out here man, I've been doing multiple interviews daily across the whole state for the past month and a half. I reach a whole lot of people on Facebook and I reach a whole lot more people everyday.
@WBobalink Oh yeah!
@MikeRwk78 One thing you also have to keep in mind is how many democrats are voting for me. I've been getting a ton off messages everyday since early voting began telling me they voted for me. Many of them have been democrats. Believe it or not @JBPritzker isn't so popular.
@MikeRwk78 Could you imagine if the Republican party was only running in half of the U.S. Senate races?
@MikeRwk78 If they had one person running they might people to get into the run off. But what's their motto here?? Let's no even try?? And let's not even try and get a majority in the statehouse??
@MikeRwk78 I'm sorry to say it but the Republican party in Illinois gave up on you. There are about 20 people running for mayor and not one of them is a Republican.
@MikeRwk78 Well rest assured this is the first step towards actually taking our state back. Having another established party will only cause the other two to get their act together. The game will change significantly and it will be so much easier for libertarians to get elected.
@MikeRwk78 So a vote for me will establish the libertarian party in Illinois. We intend to run in every single race in two years. That is the only way we will ever take back our state. Rauner at this point already caved to democrats. Another 4 years would be more pitiful than the first.
@MikeRwk78 A vote for me is a vote to actually fight back and take power away from the democrats. Right now they are only 4 seats away from having a 3/5 majority in the statehouse. If they get that we might as well not even have a governor.
@MikeRwk78 Rauner has nothing to fight.back against Democratic rule and will do nothing. He has not stood up to Madigan amd never will. Currently republicans are only running in half of the state races. You can't claim to be an opposition party if you are not even seeking a majority. https://t.co/Wg2uNaCqg4
@MikeRwk78 No offense but by throwing your vote away on Rauner your ensuring Democratic rule on our state for another 4 years and I'm not just.saying that because he is a RINO.

@lad1121 @eliyak @JBPritzker In fact, Pritzker’s investment businesses have underperformed even according to the low diversity standards of the financial services industry, a Tribune review found. He has employed few women in senior positions at the Pritzker Group.

@ppride1 @realDonaldTrump The are 4 seats away from having a 3/5 majority which at that point makes the governor obsolete. Our biggest problem is one party rule in Illinois.
@ppride1 @realDonaldTrump Libertarians will be able to work with republicans and democrats. So a lot can still get done in the beginning the the most important things regarding fiscal matters we know the democrats won't budget so we will need to unseat as many as we can in two years.
@ppride1 @realDonaldTrump We will run candidates in every race and work to take power away from the democrats. As it stands Republicans are only running candidates in half of the races. https://t.co/itFzcMGByu
@ppride1 @realDonaldTrump The reason why @BruceRauner hasn't gotten anything done is because democrats have control of the state assembly. To take power away you must take seats. After this election my party will be an established party in Illinois and have equal ballot access.
@ppride1 @realDonaldTrump I can start enacting criminal justice reform immediately but for balancing the budget and lowering taxes significantly will have to come after to years when I am able to take away some of Madigan's control.
@ppride1 @realDonaldTrump That's going to be a long answer. There are some things I will be able to get done early but the most important things will have to be done two years into my term.
Do you think if @realDonaldTrump is going to try and end birth right citizenship he should go through Congress instead of doing it by executive order????

@John_Kass @JPCarlin @pat_brady @BruceRauner Republicans aren't even running in half of the races. How can you claim to be an opposition party if you're not even attempting to gain a majority in the state?? Rauner has enabled Mike Madigan by not taking seats away from him.
@John_Kass @JPCarlin @pat_brady John if you're worried about Mike Madigan why in the world would you write an article telling people they should run back to Rauner??? @BruceRauner has done absolutely nothing to take power away from Madigan.

@luvyabitches @SWB138 @Ofthe15th Democrats are 4 seats away from having a 3/5 majority. Yet Bruce was more concerned in the last election to spend his money trying to run Sam McCann out of office rather than pick up a seat from democrats.

@MarkShe81025433 @trump4life71 @Gauthier1964 Not only that but I just received an endorsement from one of the most influential Republicans in the statehouse for a good reason. These people aren't risking their political careers for nothing.
@MarkShe81025433 @trump4life71 @Gauthier1964 If you were in Illinois you would feel differently about this race. We had two Republicans risk their political careers to challenge him for a reason. 4 years of complete failure is more than enough.
@MarkShe81025433 @trump4life71 @Gauthier1964 Bruce Rauner proved two years ago he would rather spend his own money fighting his own Republicans than he would gaining more seats in the statehouse. This is exactly why Sam McCann dropped out of the Republican party to run against him in this race.
@MarkShe81025433 @trump4life71 @Gauthier1964 By voting for me my party will become an established party in Illinois and will run candidates in all of these races. This is the definition of a long term plan. https://t.co/hH9GQkWcNs
@MarkShe81025433 @trump4life71 @Gauthier1964 The way to win in the long run is to vote for me. As it stands Republicans in Illinois are only running candidates in half of state races. Mike Madigan is the perceived boogie man in this state. The only way to take away his power is to take seats from dems.

@plantlady293 @Daisy49103 @Suntimes As leader of the Republican party in Illinois Rauner has failed to run candidates in half of the states races. I actually plan to do so when my party has equal ballot access. We will run in every race. You cannot claim to fight Madigan if you are trying to take his power away.
@plantlady293 @Daisy49103 @Suntimes A vote for Rauner is a vote for Madigan. Rauner has never and will never fight Mike Madigan. He has failed miserably. Instead of backing someone out of fear why not back someone based on liking them????
@plantlady293 @Daisy49103 @Suntimes Voting for Rauner only empowers Mike Madigan.

This is but one more reason that I speak out.  Stop the cruel and unusual treatment of innocent parents!!! #RestoreIllinois
The Lake County States Attorney Mike Nerheim is fully aware and I am disappointed that he has not been vocal about the perjury and abuse of these types of orders.  The courts prefer to ruin innocent lives rather than do their due diligence.
I was then permitted 4 hours a month with my children where I had to pay $35 per visit. They literally leased my children to me for expressing my 1st Amendment Right. This all occurred while I was still active duty military. My children were not at my Navy retirement as a result.
Judge Salvi placed me on supervised visitation and a plenary order of protection was issued for this photo along with two other photos of the writing on my truck. Judge Salvi said it was "harassing" even though there are clearly no threats or mention of the mother.
If you don't think IL courts are broken, I want you to look at this photo. My ex gained an emergency order of protection when she claimed she was afraid of me and that I threatened her.  When that story didn't hold weight in court her attorney pulled out this photo and 2 others. https://t.co/atFhsnZsW0

Police have a very difficult job. Everyday they go out and risk there lives to keep peace in our neighborhoods and we must all support them. At the same time though there has been police brutality and racial discrimination in the past and even some to this day.
I will be completely objective as Governor. I don't make decisions without facts first. Sometimes accidents do happen. Sometimes there are some bad cops. Very seldom but sometimes. Sometimes there are justified police involved shootings.
@Hollaturgurl Of course I promote justice but I will not play the judge and also will not feed into court of public opinion.
@Hollaturgurl Let our court system handle it. Part of the problem is that these continue to be politicized by grandstanding politicians. As Governor I could only implement change for the State Police which is much less likely to have one occur.
Police have a very difficult job. Everyday the go out and risk there lives to keep peace in our neighborhoods and we must all support them. At the same time though there has been police brutality and racial discrimination in the past and even some to this day.
This will not be an easy fix and definitely one that will not come overnight but I vow to do everything I can each to unite people and I will never politicize any tragedies that may occur during my time in office.
I will do what I think everyone must do. Not rush to judgement. We all need to heal the divide that is tearing this country apart. So often the media would like to whip us up into a frenzy and convince us that things went a certain way depending on what channel you might watch.
Police presence. It is an unfortunate situation when we have police involved shootings. Unfortunately some will occur during my term in office. It is important for people to know just how I will react  when people are suggesting to whether it's justified or unjustified.
As Governor I will look to bring people together. As someone who served in the Navy for 20 years I fully support and have the deepest respect police, firefighters and all emergency responders. At the same time I hear the cries from the communities that have had a very heavy

@OlySvenson @SongBird4Trump @BruceRauner @realDonaldTrump And Rauner has enabled Madigan to retain that power. Therefore he must go. To take the power back we need to challenge the Democrats in every state race. The Republicans only run in half.

@stateoftherace_ @BruceRauner @JBPritzker Go count up how many races have democrats running unopposed in this state. You'll see for yourself. The Republican party in Illinois either gave up on us or sold out to the democrats.
@stateoftherace_ @BruceRauner @JBPritzker It's Rauner fault Sam Mccann is even running. Rauner spent money to try and get him out of office because he wasn't in line with him. Talk about poor leadership.
@stateoftherace_ @BruceRauner @JBPritzker This is a one party system in Illinois. Republicans have willingly handed the power over to Mike Madigan. They are even running candidates in half of the races. Democrats are 4 seats away from having a 3/5 majority in the house. If that happens it's game over.

@BrianMRoak @BruceRauner @JBPritzker He would spend money to try and knock out Sam Mccann who was already a Republican than spend money to actually gain more seats which would have taken power away from Mike Madigan.
@BrianMRoak @BruceRauner @JBPritzker No if he is elected there is still no plan to take away the power from democrats. He is in on it. Think about how much of his own money he spent in races two years ago yet didn't run any republicans in so so many races.

@pschicago1 @BruceRauner Democrats need to gain four seats to have a three-fifths majority that can override gubernatorial vetoes.		-Ballotopedia
@pschicago1 @BruceRauner In half of the state races Republicans aren't even running candidates. This is exactly why Mike Madigan has power. The Illinois Republican Party granted him that power.
@pschicago1 @BruceRauner No the Republicans got us here by leaving democrats in this state unchallenged. Go count how many state races we have this year where the democrat is running unopposed.
@robertneville71 @hirschA8720 @JBPritzker Democrats need to gain four seats to have a three-fifths majority that can override gubernatorial vetoes.	-Ballotopedia	If this is the case then why aren't Republicans running candidates in half of the state races???
@robertneville71 @hirschA8720 @JBPritzker Mike Madigan already has full control because Republicans are leaving democrats unchallenged so many state races.
@robertneville71 @hirschA8720 @JBPritzker That's where you're dead wrong brother. In the last poll taken Rauner had 20%, Pritzker had 35% and 45% said they would vote for neither.
@BrianMRoak @BruceRauner What makes you think that Boogie man Mike and Loose Bruce aren't in it together???
@BrianMRoak @BruceRauner Many voters don't know these facts that I'm laying out right here. If they did the Republican Party in Illinois would be in some pretty deep stuff.
@BrianMRoak @BruceRauner Democrats need to gain four seats to have a three-fifths majority that can override gubernatorial vetoes.	-Ballotopedia	If this is case why is Bruce Rauner doing anything about it???
@BrianMRoak @BruceRauner How can you ever take power away from Mike Madigan if you are not even trying to beat him at the ballot box???
@BrianMRoak @BruceRauner Why are so many Democrats running unopposed in illinois this year??? Why aren't Republicans running candidates in half of the races in this state????
@pattyd1001 @BruceRauner Democrats need to gain four seats to have a three-fifths majority that can override gubernatorial vetoes.		-Ballotopedia
@pattyd1001 @BruceRauner You should go count up how many democrats are running unopposed.

@mdbattista11 @JBPritzker I know you know what I'm saying makes sense and you should verify what I am saying because more people need to know this.
@mdbattista11 @JBPritzker I would put a five year freeze on all property taxes.
@mdbattista11 @JBPritzker Well it's clear that the Illinois Republican Party has either sold out to the Democrats or has given up on Illinois.
@mdbattista11 @JBPritzker By voting for Bruce Rauner you guarantee that Mike Madigan will stay in power. Or whoever else will comes after him.
@mdbattista11 @JBPritzker Why even meet he will do nothing for anyone until you take away his power which I just showed you how to do. Clearly I have the plan. Why didn't the Republican Party in Illinois ever come up with this??
@mdbattista11 @SWB138 Rauner never stood up to Mike Madigan. All an act. Politicial theater.
@FullofWynn @lczulufaces Wynn it's time to take our state back. Face it Mike Madigan and Bruce Rauner are in on the CON job together.
@FullofWynn @lczulufaces Look bro Rauner is done. Ask him why my he complains about Mike Madigan when his party doesn't even run in half of the races in this state. How could you ever take power from Madigan if so many of his cronies run unopposed.
@MAGAWolverine @BruceRauner That's a great point. You should ask Illinois Republicans why the don't run candidates in half of all of the race here in Illinois. Is it because At the top level they are on the same team as Madigan???
@mdbattista11 @JBPritzker When I'm elected the Libertarian Party will able run candidates in every single race and actually will. We could make Mike Madigan obsolete after the second year of my term.
@mdbattista11 @JBPritzker And Republicans created.Madigan by not running candidates in half of the state races. How can the state assembly ever be taken out of the hands of democrats if no one is opposing them??? They are both in together.

@1stKnowB4UTalk @BruceRauner I'm sorry I misspoke, we're going to destroy Madigan's machine.

@1stKnowB4UTalk @BruceRauner The only way to take back the power is to start beating democrats in these races and if the Republican Party doesn't run people in about 40% of the races you have to wonder if they are in on this CON job too.
@1stKnowB4UTalk @BruceRauner Not true. Madigan only has power because Republicans are not running candidates in all of the State Rep. and State Senate races. There are so many Democrats running unopposed. When I'm elected the Libertarian Party will be able run in every single race in Illinois.

Here's a tough issue but one that must be discussed. The War on Drugs has succeeded in creating more dangerous drugs, increasing overdoses, and maxing out our prison population - but NOT reducing drug addiction. We need a sea change on drug policy. #twill		https://t.co/gev8owBlW8
@GLPatriot The best antidotes to violent crime are economic opportunity and community empowerment.
@GLPatriot I would ask: Is the Is the War on Drugs worth it? We should treat drug addiction and abuse as a health issue to be treated, strengthen economic opportunity, return fathers convicted of victimless drug crimes to their homes via a train &amp; release program.
@GLPatriot I believe you can look at Chicago over the past 40 years to see what increasing enforcement gets. We need to look at the root causes of poverty and violence.
Let's make it happen in 2018. I'd love to meet @chancetherapper and discuss how we can reform IL government for the benefit of all Illinoisans. #twill #RestoreIllinois https://t.co/JW2qMnji0e
If they can do it in Maine, we can do it here in #Illinois. Ranking candidates means you get to vote your 1st choice 1st, and if they lose, your vote gets reallocated to your 2nd choice. It's in use in Ireland, Australia, and now Maine.  #RestoreIllinois #EndTheDuopoly #twill https://t.co/xkVSTEuOgV
