@AnnCoulter Um, the day has arrived when I actually agree with this perpetually angry lady.  		Everything I’ve ever known is a lie.
@stephendpalley Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
@AirRaidAssassin @daveweigel Either you’re a bot, or you have way too much spare time.  13k + tweets inside of two years...mostly RT’s and squawking nonsense.
@AirRaidAssassin @daveweigel I just realized I’m likely engaged with a bot.  🤦🏽‍♂️
@AirRaidAssassin @daveweigel Of course they do, but I’m sure anyone can appreciate the comparison.  		It was absurd to believe that the wall funding would come directly from Mexico, just as its absurd to believe this green plan is promoting the idea that people become welfare bums.
@CNN He really should find a hobby.
@daveweigel The hyper-literalists that focus on these gaffes are undoubtedly waiting on a check from Mexico to build a wall.  Pfffffft.
@CoinbaseWallet Coinbase will end up becoming crypto’s Equifax.
@ndrew_lawrence I’m impressed that he consistently pulls off the sideways “puppy dog seeing magic tricks” look when listening to his guests.
@KevinCl66124339 It’s a familiar narrative (the other side is evil) that’s necessary to insure the zombified remain zombified.  		Exaggerate, misrepresent, sensationalize...rinse repeat.		I doubt this type of reporting changes minds...just reinforces what readers already knew to be “true”.

@WayneDupreeShow Seems to me that the councilman should’ve shown a bit more restraint.  He is a public official after all.		A pity that he felt the need to take down his accounts.  		Ideological differences are always going to exist.  Ad hominem attacks are never going to bridge the gulfs.

@JeremyDBoreing @AOC It’s amazing you can’t see that her being a standout isn’t clear evidence these oppressive, racist, white men are nearly 100% effective.  		Love how @AOC is making you and your ilk lose their minds.  		But go on, keep wondering:  “How could this have happened?”
