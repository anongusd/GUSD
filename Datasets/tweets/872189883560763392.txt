There are millions of white people in the United States that are great God -Fearing people, how can they sit back and allow this president to dismantle what millions have worked so hard to to build? We're the STRONGEST COUNTRY ON THE MAP, everyone comes to America to be like us.
The SAD thing to Donald Trump's stay in the White House is, as a Black Veteran of the armed forces we see how he has turned the clock back and is revisiting the 1800's as a world leader, but even worse is how other white professional people sit back and allow him to do it. #login

That's why that young rapper was killed in Florida...Jealousy. Sorry John but you started it, just kidding sir, Iceberg Out!!!
https://t.co/qOpQWRetcd this is a song I wrote after the Rodney King beating.	As a Black military vet, all my people should support me with my fundraiser, but they don't. WHY? because they don't want to see you do better than them.
And I don't see no other Blacks supporting her, and if there was another person supporting her it would most likely be a woman. Because our so-called black male role models are invisible.
Building confidence is great John, but we live in a materialistic world, and if we can't turn to our own people for help, who can we turn to. Maxine Waters is fighting a war with Donald Trump.
