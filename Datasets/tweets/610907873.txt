It's amazing how quickly you can lose your cardio. One week away from the gym and I'm gasping like a chain smoker.
The culmination of Pax Americana gives me a lonely sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach.

@jordanl1212 haha nope I'm staying in today lol
Bob Davie is going to do some things. It's nice to have hope for the future of UNM Football for once
Today could be a turning point in my life. Let's hope bigger and greater things are on the horizon.
@LoboSwag Lobo fans will be there to watch Coach Davie turn this program around. It won't be instantaneous but 'We believe'
Love everyone buying into political campaigns. They all follow the same formula: False promises and bash the opponent as 'bad for America'

Crazy conspiracy theorist came into work today. I was a captive audience and had no idea how to ask him to leave so I was forced to listen.
