@laresistrice @divingnomad @davereaboi @DonaldJTrumpJr Really?   Please explain, with facts, how their discussion was a coup.  	/kuÀê/	noun	1.	a sudden, violent, and illegal seizure of power from a government.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Is your racist POS dad still president?  Yes?  Then yup it would totally be the same
@DonaldJTrumpJr Right. Who wants health care.
@AlanDersh What is the harm in talking about it
@AlanDersh Agreed but
@SportsTalkRyno @JesseRodriguez Jesus Christ the article says this. Lazy is the person who mouths off without reading it first
@CarmineSabia Hey dumbass read the article
@divingnomad @laresistrice @davereaboi @DonaldJTrumpJr If having a discussion about the possibilities of using the 25th amendment is a coup attempt Then claiming the president is in eligible because he‚Äôs not a citizen fits the same bill don‚Äôt you think?
@DonaldJTrumpJr @GMA The article clearly says the Chicago police state that the Reporting is in accurate and the investigation is continuing. But hey, lying to everybody is just your thing so go for it.
@pharaohfire @davereaboi @DonaldJTrumpJr Yes, the 25th amendment requires the ACTION to come from the VP or the principal officers of the executive departments or such other body as Congress may provide, but this is just talking about it and being prepared for the possibility of needing to approach the Vice President.
@davereaboi @DonaldJTrumpJr If they were discussing using the 25th amendment then they were acting under the constitution so how is working within the law a coup?
@DonaldJTrumpJr No they realized the moron in chief is a clear and present danger to the nation

@DonaldJTrumpJr @KamalaHarris Really Donnie? Because on my taxes, it shows me exactly how many dollars I paid in in taxes and exactly how many dollars I‚Äôm not getting back.
@DonaldJTrumpJr You mean the charade where the Republicans keep pretending like there was no collusion?
@DonaldJTrumpJr You are an ignorant shit. If you actually knew how most people live, you would know that most people work the same job and have the same taxes withheld every year, and so get the same refund. If refunds are down, the government kept more. Real ppl get that.
@Marina_Sirtis @amyklobuchar @maddow And honestly a good president probably benefits from being tough, demanding and exacting.
@IlhanMN We can criticize any other country or corporation for buying our govt through lobbyists, but when you say Israel does it, you‚Äôre being racist? I don‚Äôt buy it. Sounds like a bunch of bought &amp; paid for politicians are crying crocodile tears because they‚Äôre getting paid.
@IlhanMN Stay strong congresswoman. I didn‚Äôt see anything wrong with your tweets. While Israel is an ally, Israel has far too much influence in our nation and our politics. It‚Äôs sad when we can‚Äôt criticize a foreign country without being called racist.
It seems like white men in Virginia‚Äôs strategy is to all confess together so its too much to ask them all to resign. #blackface #Resign

@WalshFreedom I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one. I‚Äôm sure we could find leaders who had the good sense and moral strength not to do racist stupid things like that in their past.
@WalshFreedom How can you endorse a leader to govern a multi racial society who has it demonstrated a racist streak in his past? I too was raised in a racist southern environment, but I never put on black face and I never engaged in racist activities.
@WalshFreedom What if he attended a lynching 20 years ago? What if he sold drugs 20 years ago? What if you kidnap a child 20 years ago? What crime is too bad and how long is too long?
