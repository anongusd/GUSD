@RichLucido The problem in Austin is people coming out of the bars and then riding around drunk ü§£
@WayneRoot Of course if we let those that produce keep their money there would be more money available for disasters like this.
@WayneRoot Never understood how money could flow out of our country when it‚Äôs obvious we have problems here at home.
@WayneRoot Well as our ‚Äúgreat‚Äù president is always saying: those at the top just have ‚Äúto do a little more.‚Äù
@zewing Has it always been an ‚Äúopt out process?‚Äù I thought you had to qualify for the playoffs!!

@earthlingworks I watched your course on @Mixergy today. I can totally relate!! Thanks.
@AndrewWarner I sit and watch my wife into Pinterest on her iPad every night. I just can‚Äôt seem to get into it.
@joelgascoigne Hardest part of side projects for me is the start and stop. It‚Äôs having to stop without feeling anything was accomplished.
Heard a speaker say, ‚Äúif I let you know what I care about deeply then you can hurt me.‚Äù - so true and applies to many situations.
@GovGaryJohnson where can I read about the 5% ending the 2 party system? I am very interested.

RT @beepreps: If Central Section D-I seeding were today: 1, Clovis; 2, Clovis North; 3, Frontier; 4, Central; 5, Bakersfield #prepblitz
@PAGMETER plus Centrals loss to Clovis was by 2 points. They missed two PATs and 2 FG in that game. Clovis could have scored in last min.
@AndrewWarner those guys are good at their pitch. It‚Äôs a LIVE infomercial. That guy with the sponge had a great pitch on Shark Tank L-night

@beepreps Plus you have to factor Centrals 2 point loss to Clovis. They missed 2 PATs and 2 FG in that loss. Kicking game killed them.

@unbounce I bailed on a form today because they wanted a crazy amount of info to attend a free Webinar. I almost had it all filled out!
@beepreps Can the Clovis defense shut down that CN offense??
@beepreps That should be a good one. Can't believe how bad the CN v Central game was!! Central score more points against CN though!

@_RepDanGordon all the while he shares his grand plans to retire early and "double dip"
@_RepDanGordon he basically told me that he had no issues using the government to take more money from me to pay his retirement.
@ThomasEWoods Tom I always enjoy when you step in for Peter on the radio show. Your book Rollback was great!
@TheGrok I wasn't being critical to you just the idea that we can arbitrarily compare conversion values.
@TheGrok I understand that. It's just that what I'm tracking and what you may be tracking probably have no connection. Apples to Oranges.
@TheGrok what are they counting as a conversion. Those numbers are meaningless without context.
Goodbye multiple twitter accounts!
I just don't care if someone doesn't agree with my views ... they are MY views.
