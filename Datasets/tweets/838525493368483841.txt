When Republicans in Congress blocked Democratic efforts to #EndGunViolence after Sandy Hook, our heart sank as a nation. The strength and courage of grieving Newtown families and the activists born of that tragedy eventually galvanized us at the ballot box to say enough! https://t.co/tgLTauL0Wv
In the last election, candidates were confronted with an urgent call for meaningful legislation to #EndGunViolence when the #Parkland shooting transformed a group of teen survivors into our national conscience. They and other young people across America made the difference! https://t.co/OWXi3AYZMD
As gun violence remains a national crisis in our communities, our thoughts are with families that have lost loved ones and our prayers are that the US Senate will listen to the people‚Äôs cries for common sense solutions to #EndGunViolence and keep our families safe. https://t.co/Lfto1MTwbz
This week, the Democratic House Majority made good on a sacred promise from the campaign trail to work to #EndGunViolence as a top priority if Democrats took back the House.

Rep Gibbs: 45 is across the world trying to make the world safer and you call him a racist and a cheat. I don't see that. I see a pres that's very sincere and tryna make this country better for every American. Real repentence wold be to go away and serve your time.
Daily Beast just reported that Stone texted them to say Cohen has lied.
Rep Hill (if southern accent betrays a GOP, a female voice indicates the member is female). I did not come here for partisan bickering. I came here for the truth. I ask these Qs to find out if 45 committed a crime. She is talking way too fast.
