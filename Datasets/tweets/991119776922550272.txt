@CarrieChrryslsh @EpicWomenVets @MichelleObama So this lady that says military supports the Obama‚Äôs is dead wrong. He didn‚Äôt care about our troops. Nor did he want to pay them. In his term more got out of the military.
@CarrieChrryslsh @EpicWomenVets @MichelleObama Well one my brother in law is is retired military. Obama could care less about him or his family or his soldiers that are active. Another My husband and I paid out more taxes in the last 8 years when he was in office. Now we don‚Äôt we get a tax return now for the hard work we do.
@CarrieChrryslsh @EpicWomenVets @MichelleObama They don‚Äôt support her here in NC. Maybe the county of Cumberland because a lot of military lives outside the county. I know when they came to FSU I didn‚Äôt see no military spouses or active duty there.
@EpicWomenVets @MichelleObama I don‚Äôt know what military women you‚Äôre talking about. But ours at Fort Bragg don‚Äôt support her.
@MichaelAvenatti @realDonaldTrump Dude trump don‚Äôt owe you nothing but your client owes him money. About Cohen? Who cares about him. Cuz he‚Äôs a scam artist.
