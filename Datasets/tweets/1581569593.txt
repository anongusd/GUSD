@aeconnelly @SimplyBelieveIt @PastorDScott @BerniceKing It is my choice to have a concealed carry. We are not required to register our guns or ourselves. WA recently passed a law to close the gun show loop hole, but many states in this area still allow gun show owners to sell to strangers without ID.
@aeconnelly @SimplyBelieveIt @PastorDScott @BerniceKing Ms Iam:  I cannot change your beliefs. I live in Spokane (red area) WA (blue state). I have unregistered guns &amp; it is totally legal. NJ is strict on guns, WA is not. I have a concealed pistols license. No training is required in WA state. https://t.co/faYb6iJJWH
@aeconnelly @SimplyBelieveIt @PastorDScott @BerniceKing Ms Iam: This is a fun 1 to answer. I‚Äôve bought guns without ID. As a white guy in a red area, I have purchased guns from unregulated gun shows. Paid in cash &amp; a hand shake. Voter ID in theory is a good idea. It is the unfair enforcement.

@Educated2143 @PastorDScott You are an interesting person. Yes, many accounts following Dr Scott are bots/anon accounts.

@deplorablemac1 @PastorDScott I thought you right wingers are against the government requiring all to have a government issued ID. In your bubble, you get an ID when grown up. There are groups who don‚Äôt get state issued IDs (natives on tribal land without a postal address, which ND says is unacceptable).
@BGMorgan4 @PastorDScott If done free of charge. Read my response to Dr Scott.
@PastorDScott Is being rich enough to fly a requirement to vote?  Valid ID issued free by the state would be great. TX voter ID was shot down because it wasn‚Äôt free with the hidden costs. Let‚Äôs use our tax dollars to issue all citizens ID free of charge. Right wingers would be opposed to this.

@bob_wilson @Teri_Kanefield Bigger issue, how to remove unfair power from deplorables. Unfair because this minority controls President &amp; both houses of Congress, but didn‚Äôt do it with the popular majority. Electoral college currently favors the Repubs.
@bob_wilson @Teri_Kanefield Not moot. For Pence to pardon, Trump cannot be president. I‚Äôm OK with just getting rid of Trump. Pence isn‚Äôt charismatic, so he won‚Äôt win an election.

@RealCandaceO No it is not. The right (&amp; you) believe in your truth. The left believes in theirs. Every religion believes in theirs. Even you believed in the left truth at one time. Now you say you follow the real Truth. What‚Äôs to stop you from changing again &amp; finding the real real Truth?

@cyberberry1 @davidmweissman Tribalism is a very deep human instinct. We feel it on all sides, not just USA. Eg: Hutu v Tutsi, Viet Congress v South Vietnamese, Muslims v Christians, Protestants v IRA. If you look honestly at yourself, you will see us belonging to a tribe.

@slcraig @An0n_American @maximum1976 @Ssb21us @NormElias25 @RyanAFournier @SteveWinwood @realDonaldTrump I agree about disinformation &amp; power. I could be a fake account. Twitter‚Äôs anonymity allows for so much disinfo. I believe your timeline is awful &amp; full of right wing propaganda &amp; apparently you believe it is me that has it wrong. We can both be wrong &amp; live in the matrix.
@slcraig @Ssb21us @NormElias25 @maximum1976 @RyanAFournier @SteveWinwood IDoNot: because you are an anonymous propaganda account for trump, you will never see anything negative about trump.
@An0n_American @slcraig @maximum1976 @Ssb21us @NormElias25 @RyanAFournier @SteveWinwood @realDonaldTrump Anon: yes this twitter is like junior high. We have anonymous accounts pretending to be whatever they want &amp; saying awful things without consequences. Saying you (whoever you are) are tired of the hate while tweeting hate on your timeline.

There are still 28,000 US troops still in S Korea pointing lots of guns to the North. The NK has thousands of artillery pieces aimed at Seoul. NK has broken promises over &amp; over. NK is the most brutal regime on Earth.

@jercampbell9 @Blazenhozen @gt5841b @maximum1976 @Ssb21us @RyanAFournier @SteveWinwood 4/ You did say do. Well this trade war will be interesting. Other countries are smart &amp; will fight back where it hurts Trump supporters. I‚Äôll wait for Mueller‚Äôs report. Mueller is a decorated war veteran who is well respected by both Repubs &amp; Dems. If Mueller clears Trump,
@jercampbell9 @Blazenhozen @gt5841b @maximum1976 @Ssb21us @RyanAFournier @SteveWinwood 3/ I could keep going, but there is a good chance since you are a Trumper, you don‚Äôt see anything wrong with a narcissist liar who only cares about grabbing power by degrading half the country.

@abn82rigr @Ssb21us @RyanAFournier @SteveWinwood Heavy: Interesting twitter account. Shows pictures of being 82nd Airborne, but afraid to give your name. Your account is driven to agitate. This Twitter is all about the smack down. Most people pretending to be a character &amp; yelling a lot.
@realsnyder Who is the person(s) behind this account? This is a right wing agitation account, but who is pulling the strings?  All rhetorical questions, since I‚Äôll never know.
@TheFFChild @Ssb21us @maximum1976 @RyanAFournier @SteveWinwood Christians, Jews, Muslims, Mormons, etc worship the same God of Abraham. The most hatred of humans is between believers of the same God, but different sects. IRA vs Protestant, Sunni vs Shia, North vs South (US Civil War).
@Pole_43 @Ssb21us @RyanAFournier @SteveWinwood Per a survey I remember seeing 60% of vets voted for Trump. My sisters &amp; their husbands are 3 I know of. My brothers &amp; I (3 total) voted against him. We still have large family vacations with my Mom &amp; us 5 kids &amp; 15 grandkids. Twitter &amp; news have you believing this ain‚Äôt so.
@Ssb21us @RyanAFournier @SteveWinwood Steven: I commend Trump for commuting Alice Marie Johnson‚Äôs life sentence for a 1 time non-violent drug charge. Remember this as proof that a liberal can compliment POTUS. However, that one act doesn‚Äôt change my negative opinion of Trump.
@gon_hntn dog lover, father &amp; vet. I love your bio.
@gt5841b @maximum1976 @Ssb21us @RyanAFournier @SteveWinwood And you &amp; I believe the same. Many in my red district believe Trump. The more he gaslights the more they double down with him. The best way I have engaged with my red friends is not to attack, but ask probing questions face to face. Steven: do you believe Trump?
@kamspaug @maximum1976 @Ssb21us @NormElias25 @RyanAFournier @SteveWinwood I‚Äôm OK with crass. We Liberals are very crass. I believe in our free USA. I‚Äôm very against a wanna be authoritarian. Maybe you‚Äôre OK with authoritarians as long as they are on your side. Right now it is just a lot of twitter hatred. Hopefully it doesn‚Äôt escalate to violence.
@gt5841b @maximum1976 @Ssb21us @RyanAFournier @SteveWinwood Tricia: Do you believe Trump?
@gt5841b @maximum1976 @Ssb21us @RyanAFournier @SteveWinwood Tricia: attacks go both ways, especially on Twitter. I‚Äôm not attacking you. My Mom voted for Trump. I despise Trump &amp; still love &amp; talk to my Mom. As I said earlier, it comes down to who do you ‚Äúwant to‚Äù believe?  There are huge echo chambers on both sides.
@Ssb21us @NormElias25 @maximum1976 @RyanAFournier @SteveWinwood It is ironic. I see hatred as a driving force for both parties to turn out voters. Dems had love trumps hate. Repubs had family values. Both don‚Äôt really follow their own mantra.
@maximum1976 @Ssb21us @NormElias25 @RyanAFournier @SteveWinwood Steven: it wasn‚Äôt that bad when Bush beat Gore with a Supreme Court intervention. It isn‚Äôt that Trump is R, it‚Äôs cause Trump is trying to trash our free society for power. And I saw the hatred &amp; disrespecting of Obama, cause I‚Äôm a blue dot in a red area.
@kamspaug @maximum1976 @Ssb21us @NormElias25 @RyanAFournier @SteveWinwood 2/ Telling his followers to punch them in the face. Working to undermine Mueller, a decorated combat vet &amp; Republican, so he can convince his followers he is being persecuted. Trump isn‚Äôt waiting for the report which might exonerate him. Suing people just to bully them. &amp; more
@kamspaug @maximum1976 @Ssb21us @NormElias25 @RyanAFournier @SteveWinwood It isn‚Äôt blatant IMHO. Many liberals won‚Äôt agree with me. Saying an American judge of Hispanic origin will be against Trump just because he is Hispanic is racist by definition. Calling press who disagree with Trump ‚Äúenemies of the state‚Äù is intolerant. 1/
@Ssb21us @NormElias25 @maximum1976 @RyanAFournier @SteveWinwood Obama didn‚Äôt get respect from the right. Trump was a leader in disrespecting Obama. Now Trump isn‚Äôt getting respect from the left. It doesn‚Äôt make it right, but appears to be part of tribal human nature. Also our constitution allows this freedom to disrespect our leaders.
@Ssb21us @LeslieCourtne15 @maximum1976 @RyanAFournier @SteveWinwood I see Trump more like a ‚Äúmob boss‚Äù leader. It isn‚Äôt the kind of leader I consider great. Many of my fellow Americans like Trump‚Äôs take charge attitude. Many others see it as bullying &amp; demeaning.
@Ssb21us @NormElias25 @maximum1976 @RyanAFournier @SteveWinwood 2/ if I‚Äôm wrong, then I live in the false reality. If you are wrong, then you live in the false reality. The truth could be somewhere in between, but tribalism doesn‚Äôt allow for gray area beliefs. Getting out of my bubble has been informative.
@Ssb21us @NormElias25 @maximum1976 @RyanAFournier @SteveWinwood Steven. It appears when I can discuss (&amp; not shout) with Trump supporters it all comes down to belief. I believe Trump lies most of the time. #MAGA believe Trump &amp; don‚Äôt believe MSM. Facts seem to be irrelevant because each side only believes their side‚Äôs facts.  1/

Most humans believe in their facts (aka beliefs). Proof: most humans believe in an invisible sky daddy as fact &amp; cannot agree on which sky daddy rules them all. All Hail Odin!

8/ But that doesn't stop humans from selectively choosing which facts/truths they believe.
7/ And yes, a majority of humans believe in a single Truth/Fact like we need air in order to live.
6/ Therefore, in 1 example, a majority of humans don't believe in a single Truth/Fact.  There are others, like politics, climate change, etc
5/ No matter which religion/non-religion is correct and believes in the Truth, a majority (the others) don't believe that Truth.
4/ All religions/non-religions believe the other religions/non-religions don't believe in the True God.  They don't believe in their Fact.
3/ Eg: Religion and who is God. There is no religion/non-religion in the world with a majority (over 50%).
2/ Logical Proof: Only need to show 1 example, of which there are many, where a majority of humans don't believe the same fact and/or truth
1/ I hear a lot: "Why don't the other side believe in facts?"  Well, that is because a majority of humans don't believe in the same facts.
