@Roblox Listen to the community from now on! Censor the REAL dirty words.
@Hasbro You should start doing a retail division that has stores across the nation.
@BonJovi You're the worst thing about humanity.
Jon Bon Jovi? More like Jon Bon Nosy! Get a life, Runaway!
@JaredLeto Jared Leto has no respect for his fans whatsoever. He can burn in hell.

@BurgerKing Are you okay???
@BurgerKing Have you been tripping lately? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
@InsideRoblox I keep getting friend requests from scammers who say they give away free Robux. Please help me in any way possible.
@DavidBaszucki Roblox is not the same now that literally everything is needlessly censored. Next time, ask the staff to do only the REAL dirty words (AKA the 7 dirty words according to Wikipedia.)

@TPCarney Indeed it is shameful... I just want to kill those democratic bastards so bad!
@Shyfoox What's new for the 8/28/2018 update of Dragons life?
@JaredLeto can burn in hell for being a fucking stupid douchebag while signing autographs. Yep! That's what she said.
@StephenKing All the shit you are saying, and what every other fucking person is saying about @realDonaldTrump is not funny whatsoever! Even the memes are bullshit!
@markiplier That is true
@EA My heart honestly goes out to you... 😔

@tonyhawk @LakaiLTD How come you aren't with @nikesb ?
If the 2016 @Cubs were around in 1999, and they beat the Atlanta Braves at that year's World Series, they would've actually won their first championship win in 91 years! And their first time at a World Series in 54 years!
Michael Jordan wore the number 23 on his jersey. @KingJames wears that same number on his Cavaliers jersey. Coincidence? I don't think so. Because it's truly more than meets the eye! #Bulls

@PrazMaster @kylehendricks28 @Cubs @emmaahendricks hmm
@realDonaldTrump Tell every person that hates you to make up their fucking minds because you are a better president than that @BarackObama cunt!
@KaivanShroff Make up your fuckin' mind!

@EA Tell these people to make up their fuckin' goddamn minds!!! Do it, EA, I mean it! And please make Skate 4 already! And @TheSims 4 Complete Edition.
@Wendys I see what you did there! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

They are not policing themselves enough when it comes to their in game chat and contact settings. Join me if you want to do so as well.
I'm boycotting Roblox!
@DennysDiner Ihob shade ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
@DiGiorno agree with u all da wae, @DiGiorno
This is why @Roblox is not policing themselves enough: Their chat has become too much and there needs to be other ways to chat with players while not getting in trouble with pedophiles and immature 4 year-old retards.
@Roblox When Roblox needs to start being more strict with their contact settings.
@Shyfoox Someone on Dragon's Life told me if I wanted to have sex a few weeks ago and I got in trouble by doing just that...
#IHateDemocrats Honestly, all the stuff that is being told on the media is nothing but fake all over! Do you even realize that the Democrats are brainwashing you like they're Big Brother or something and that the Republicans are the real heroes?
#ChangeAMoviesSize Can't it be opposite movie titles?
I'm hoping @Roblox does something about their chat settings soon.
@StephenKing You're an obstructive prick just like the Democrats.

@guardian Why do tadpoles always look like sperm
@Roblox is not policing themselves enough when it comes to their chat mode. I'd rather be playing @TheSims than spend years waiting for @Roblox to finally do something about their in game chat settings because I am having none of their bullshit!
Watched one of Skillet's old music videos a while ago and all I can think of is that John Cooper looks like one of the Backstreet Boys.
my parents banned me from chatting on Roblox and now I have had it! If they are going to say that no one talking in game is fine, I'm moving to Mexico! and the rest of my fucking family ain't coming with!
@DavidBaszucki  Please help... My parents will not let me chat on @Roblox in game at all... there needs to be more chat settings... Thanks
@Roblox My parents won't let me chat in game at all! Fuck my goddamn parents! Let them burn in hell for not letting me chat! Do something with the fucking chat settings now before I kill myself!
@Wendys to me has honestly the best bacon cheeseburger I have ever had! Keep up the good work!😘

@WaltDisneyWorld I hope you bring back ET alien encounter!
@tonyhawk Are you religious? Let me introduce you to my religion! ✝️
@UniversalORL Make up your mind!!! Back in 2002, Six Flags Great America wanted to tear down the whizzer and replace it with ultimate flight. However, due to negative feedback from park goers, they took down shockwave instead. You should have followed their advice.
@SixFlags hi. I wish you could have told the folks at universal one thing...
@SixFlagsGM you should have told Universal Orlando not to tear down Dragon Challenge and told them you were to tear down the Whizzer almost 16 years ago but due to negative backlash scrapped Shockwave instead.
@UniversalORL Had you actually read the feedback from the people and responded, that would not have happened...
@UniversalORL hi there. My family recently went for spring break. We saw that Dragon Challenge was removed. I heard that it was scrapped for good.
#AskUniversal hi there. My family and I recently went to Universal Florida for spring break and when we went to Harry Potter world we saw that Dragon Challenge was no more.
#askuniversal hello my family and I recently went to your park and we saw that Dragon Challenge was removed. That was very unnecessary.
@UniversalORL I recently went to your park and I saw that Dragon Challenge was removed. I heard that it was scrapped.
@EA I’m wondering if you might be working on a remastered edition of Skate and a port on the Nintendo Switch. Answer back, thanks.

@Disney Where is that Jake Long kid? I would love to see a live action reboot of it on Freeform with @FinalCutKing as the lead role. Thanks!
@EA Can’t you just do a reboot of Skate? A Skate 4 is too overhyped. A reboot with Ghost Games as developer and Tony Hawk would work. Thanks.
@taankisbomb Giovanni Reda wants to know your location.
What about just a complete reboot of Skate? Your thoughts, @EA .

@mindykaling I love you, Mindy! I am also a fan!

@Activision fuck you for ruining the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater franchise and making Robomodo go bankrupt.

@Beats1 @tonyhawk EA called... they want you to work with them!
@EA You should also work with Tony Hawk.
@EA Either Skate 4 or a complete reboot of the Skate franchise.
That and I am also a Christian. But hey... I am not offended!
Honestly, I am not offended by the name ‘Sweet Jesus’ as a dessert shop, but I am offended by the controversy that has been going on for the last few days. #sweetjesusicecream
@tonyhawk Hi! I am a fan of you. I’m Nate. It’s nice to meet you.

@tonyhawk Now that you don’t work with Activision anymore, you can help EA make Skate again!
