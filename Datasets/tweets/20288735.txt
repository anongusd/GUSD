It was an act of God that brought me here, and I’m eternally grateful to Him for making me a Californian. 🙏🏽
RT @MaddowBlog: Watch tonight's full A block here: https://t.co/Z7iAqugPhB
@ConnieBevill @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/b3svuHeeEJ
I’m confident @HouseDemocrats under @SpeakerPelosi’s leadership will do amazing things.		But freshmen: remember that you’re 1 of 435. Your voice is no more or less important based on social media.		And respect those that paved the way for you to be a member of the 116th Congress.
They don’t need a huge social media following to get things done. They’ve been getting things done for decades without it.		Some may think they’re not “progressive” or “liberal” enough, or “too old,” just because they don’t have a social media presence.		But that’s just not true.
I’m not singling out @AOC, but given that the press and social media keep referring to her as the freshman “superstar,” I’m using her as a point of reference.		To return to the issue of seniority: keep in mind that some of the longest-serving members of Congress are not famous.
And so, I respectfully request of @AOC &amp; the freshmen Democrats: please use social media to elevate Democratic policies, to champion your community’s causes, to bring awareness to issues &amp; work #ForThePeople.		But don’t use social media to promote yourselves or to gain leverage.
Again, I think that social media has done good things for our country. But also many terrible things.		Trump has showed us that the power of having many followers is also dangerous. He thinks that because so many people follow/listen to him, his voice is the only 1 that matters.
Trump doesn’t play well with others. He doesn’t care about anything but whatever it is HE WANTS, which changes by the second. (And because of social media: we have a record of it all.)		That’s the danger I fear freshmen Democrats face today. Social media has made them superstars.
I honestly believe that without social media, Donald Trump would not be president. Between Russian troll farms, bots, and the media, Trump was in our face 24/7.		He didn’t say anything of value. His “policies” were just 3-word chants. But he talked loudly and often about himself.
But we all know social media is also dangerous. It has made self-absorbed narcissists of us all, to some extent. Whether it’s the tweet that goes viral, the hottest take, or a sexy selfie, we’re constantly promoting ourselves.		And sometimes: the only voice we hear is our own. 😔
And that brings me to my second concern: social media superstardom.		I’m old enough to remember life (and politics) without the Internet. Social media has definitely advanced our ability to connect with our leaders, organize our communities, fight for causes in which we believe.
They understand that you don’t get EVERYTHING you want. And in this hyper-partisan age, compromise is the only way we will be able to get anything done #ForThePeople.		Do I like that? No. I think Democratic policies are the best for America. But not every American agrees with me.
First, I want to discuss the issue of seniority. Seniority matters. Whether you like it or not, it does. And it’s NOT because the older folks want to keep the youngsters down.		Senior members of Congress understand negotiation, legislation, and governance better. They just do.
But I have some concerns regarding some of the new Democratic members of Congress.		While I appreciate the enthusiasm of the freshmen, and I’m stoked we’re pumping new blood into our Party, there seems to be some official (and unofficial) rules that they don’t understand.
I’m a lifelong liberal Democrat from the San Francisco Bay Area. I grew up w/progressive icons @SpeakerPelosi @SenFeinstein @BarbaraBoxer @KamalaHarris @JerryBrownGov @GavinNewsom @JackieSpeier @RepBarbaraLee.		I proudly fought alongside fellow Democrats to win the House in 2018.
@ReaganBattalion Bruh. Y’all should not be stepping into the race debate unless it’s to admit that your party has failed people of color for half a century.		Otherwise: shut it.
@KAMALAMODE @Needle_of_Arya @KildayMorgan WTF is up w/Justice Dems? They don’t understand politics or governance: the left’s Freedom Caucus.		Gave AOC props for yesterday. But it pisses me off that the press gave all the credit to @AOC for the line of questioning that @LacyClayMO1 started.		FALL BACK &amp; STOP GRANDSTANDING https://t.co/Mxa6Ww35gY
@washingtonpost I don’t give AF about media stardom. I care about working together to get things done #ForThePeople.		Making threats against the chamber you JUST joined is stupid. @AOC taking a page out of Trump’s playbook. 🙄		She needs to fall back &amp; respect @SpeakerPelosi. STOP grandstanding.

@gtconway3d Even more sensible plan:		@TheJusticeDept gets rid of the shoddy, unconstitutional memo from the height of Watergate, written solely to protect Nixon &amp; oust Agnew.		If a sitting president can’t be indicted, he’s King. America got rid of our king in 1776.		https://t.co/mPMIfwuIZf

@DonaldJTrumpJr That’s not what happened. At all. 		My word. You people are either very ignorant or incredibly dishonest to your supporters. Or can you not read? 🤔		It’s a shame what you’ve done to 30% of our country. Don’t worry: your indictment &amp; arrest will happen any day now — Individual-2.
