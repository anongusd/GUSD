“We have got to get back in the game &amp; lead in order to promote American energy independence and serve as a bulwark against Russian &amp; Chinese aggression.”
“The United States – as a leader in energy production - has a unique role to play in developing &amp; commercializing innovative technology solutions. We need to prioritize advancing technologies like carbon capture that we can employ both here at home &amp; overseas.”
“As we’ve discussed at previous hearings, breakthrough technologies will help us reliably meet our energy needs in the future while decarbonizing our energy system.”
“Energy is often thought of as the heart of the climate debate. So, I’m very happy that @IEABirol is here to help give us the global picture on energy trends.”
“It’s been some time since the Senate took a hard look at where we stand in terms of the power sector as it relates to #climatechange so I’m excited that @lisamurkowski &amp; I will be holding a #climatehearing next week to discuss where things stand here in the US &amp; globally.”
@Sen_JoeManchin @lisamurkowski “We believe that the US needs to continue to lead in sustainable energy production as well as develop the energy technologies that incentivize other nations to reduce emissions to address #climatechange.”
.@Sen_JoeManchin: “Both @lisamurkowski &amp; I come from energy producing states that have helped lead the US to energy independence. West Virginia’s coal &amp; coal miners have done a lot of the heavy lifting for this country’s economy &amp; #WV continues to be an energy exporter.”

.@Sen_JoeManchin: While the system performed well, rising natural gas demand made it economical to bring on coal to keep the lights on and homes warm. Coal will continue to be critical in extreme weather situations.
.@Sen_JoeManchin: Last week’s brutal cold provided another test case for how our electricity grid is often stressed and changing.
.@Sen_JoeManchin: Especially during events like last week’s polar vortex, I know communities around the country are grateful for the energy supply &amp; reliability that #WV provides.

.@Sen_JoeManchin: #WV &amp; its neighbors, also has the historic opportunity to develop an Appalachian Storage Hub. This innovative regional storage and distribution hub would create jobs &amp; reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
.@Sen_JoeManchin: In 2016, #WV ranked 5th among states in total energy production according to @EIAgov. And our little state consistently exports more electricity than it consumes.

More than 80 percent of these increased costs would flow to just five coal and nuclear companies. https://t.co/T90uBmkSiL #StopTheTrumpCoalBailout

At some point, even $5 increases year-after-year will have an adverse effect on visitation, and in turn will depress the recreation economy.  We should understand those effects before deciding on new fee increases, &amp; not after. #HikeTrailsNotFees https://t.co/JUPzl4JzmH

If you care about the workers of the #mining industry, bring a miner pension bill to the Senate. Don't overturn a rule saying Polluters Pay.

We must making a living from our resources, and we must take care of our resources in order to make a living. –Shaun Sims, Rancher
#Mitigation policies in #PresidentialMemorandum principles yield efficiency, predictability &amp; better environmental outcomes. -@LynnScarlett1
Defined in #NEPA and evolved under Clean Water Act and Endangered Species Act, mitigation is not new to the U.S. policy arena @LynnScarlett1
We work proactively with proponents in designing projects that reduce adverse impacts to resources. –Ferebee @forestservice #mitigation
In assessing mitigation, the @forestservice aims to #1 avoid impacts; #2 minimize them; #3 compensate for any impacts that are unavoidable.
Safe, responsible development of our #federallands &amp; #naturalresources are a shared responsibility among all of us. -@DOIBeanScene
Effective #mitigation of impacts caused by development is critical in fulfilling @Interior's statutory mandates. -@DOIBeanScene
We can do better by approaching #mitigation systematically, which we’ve seen at the state level—including in #Washington. -@SenatorCantwell
The concepts in the memorandum have a #bipartisan history over a long period of time. -@SenatorCantwell #mitigation https://t.co/xyJL2UavPy
The #PresidentialMemorandum does NOT create any new mitigation requirements at any agency; it is merely guidance. -@SenatorCantwell
We’ve learned it's more expensive to fix unmitigated development AFTER the fact, than it is to do it right the first time. -@SenatorCantwell
