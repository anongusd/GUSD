@SenFranken 8. "You're giving up everything!!!"		Dems have flipped ​~35 GOP-held seats in 2017 (30% flip rate), &amp; in places like OK, FL, NH, VA, etc. They narrowly lost big races in SC, MT, &amp; GA. Their success to date is crazy.		But sure, they don't know how to fight; hope is lost; etc
@SenFranken 7. "No one can replace @SenFranken!"		Franken's primary qualifications for the job were being funny &amp; famous. 		So who could ever replace him? For starters: literally ANY progressive female lawyer, judge, biologist, farmer, or veteran in the entire effing state of Minnesota.
@SenFranken 6. "This is NOT what people want!"		Minnesotans get first dibs here, &amp; A Nov 20 poll found that only 22% of them &amp; 34% of MN Dems thought Franken should serve out his term. Only 1 in 3 MN Dems! And this was before the 7th and 8th accusations.
@SenFranken 5. "What Trump/Moore did was worse!" 		This is pathetic. "You're not in trouble b/c Sam broke an even worse rule!"		Of course what Trump &amp; Moore did was worse AND each man damaged the office they (aspire to) hold. Each man should resign.
@SenFranken 4. "We NEED Al to defeat the tax bill!"		Bills pass by majority, not  plurality. They need 50 ayes. A  bill with 30 ayes fails whether it faces 70 nays or 0 nays &amp; 70 abstentions. 		There are 52 GOP Senators in the 116th. Unless Al votes with the GOP, his nays stop nothing.
@SenFranken 3. "But the ethics committee!"		The Ethics Committee is a black hole that allows men to serve out their terms without consequence. They last removed someone in 1995, after 19 allegations against Sen Packwood. Even w/evidence from his own diary, it took 3 yrs of investigation.
@SenFranken 2. "I can't believe the Dems forced out Al!"		The Senate has clear procedures for removing a member. This wasn't it. At all.		No one forced out @SenFranken. Members of his own party called on him to step aside. He did.
1. "You​ deprived​ Al of due process!" 		Due process (5A &amp; 14A) prevents the state from violating our rights. ie guarantees fair  legal proceedings. @SenFranken is neither under arrest nor facing trial. The state is taking NO action against him. 		"Due process" is irrelevant.
There's an inordinate amount of confusion about Franken's resignation and it's possible impact in the 116th Congress.		Clearing up 8 things (as pedantically as possible). /thread

@NateSilver538 Surely some of it just getting on the ballot. GOP ran uncontested in 33/100 VA house districts in 2013. Dems challenged in 27 of them in 2017. They flipped 3. And Northam did considerably better w/down-ballot competition. https://t.co/RLZdaJuo9C

* Dammit! I ALWAYS get McAuliffe's name wrong.
We hear a lot about how the top of the ticket shapes down-ballot races, but contesting local races can have upstream consequences, even in fairly uncompetitive districts.		So think of someone smart &amp; respectable. Then force them run. They have to run &amp; you have to help them.	/end
The vote at the top of the ticket looked quite similar in these districts in 2013. Not so in 2017. Where Dems still didn't get on the ballot, Northam did slightly worse (-1.4). Where they did get on the ballot, Northam made significant gains (+5.3). That's almost a 7-pt gain.		/4 https://t.co/Wsl3UPe1Kr
Down-ballot challenges might also have upstream effects.		Northam outgained McCaullife (Dem Gov candidate in 2013) across the state. Same in the 33 previously uncontested districts. But Northam gained considerably more in places that had a local Dem on the ballot by 2017.		/3 https://t.co/7ylPbwA4ch
In 2013, Dems didn't even field a candidate in 33 of VA's 100 House districts. By 2017:		* Dems challenged in 27 of those 33 districts (82%)	* 60% of their candidates were female	* Dems averaged 33% of the vote (vs to 0% in 2013)	* they FLIPPED 3 of those seats (11% success)		/2
Why you must find someone you respect &amp; make her run for office...		The splashy headline from last week was that Dems flipped 15 House seats in VA, reducing the GOP supermajority to a 1-seat lead. But what happened in some fairly red districts is far more interesting. 		/1

@nowwerevolt @mikefarb1 @RVAwonk I know how to spot a bot. That Trump has lots (~49%) of bot followers Does Not Mean that he's suddenly amassing a big bot following.

@stupi_djerk @mikefarb1 I believe that too! Just not clear that he's suddenly gaining more bots now than before. Again, the change is almost linear.
@stupi_djerk @mikefarb1 I fully accept that 49% of his followers are bots. But the claim that he's suddenly gaining 5mm bots a day appears to be false.

Not a word from POTUS on the storms in MS/GA/FL? Surely it's unrelated to the demographics of the devastated areas.

Freedom Caucus posts First 100 days agenda Nothing on guns/Obamacare. Lots on climate/immigration. Read. Share. Act. https://t.co/jI4nrgNE4R
@bkarbour Get Aston Martin to sponsor an aerial/underwater combo drone? I'm in!
