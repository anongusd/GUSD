@_Chuck_U @prageru @AOC yeah but if you listen to the Christians there is no hope of getting out alive. At least with the climate people there is a chance to continue living.
@KyleKashuv Clarity: No child should have to go through the agony of birth when all of their organs are on the outside of them just because you want to get right with GOD. Your relationship with GOD bears no weight on the agony felt for you to feel good.

@MollyJongFast Like exhibit 1947 Gates, Manafort, ...		Rohrabacher would be too long for the 8 characters under the black box.		Butina is 6 characters so that doesn’t seem right.		Gen. Flynn is more than 8.		McConnell is 9 and could fit because of the length. The double l takes up less space.
@MollyJongFast It seems to me that if someone wanted to they could count the characters of the redacted names and find which name fits. General Michael Flynn, if they called him that, is not the same length as say Maria Butina.

@Nopesorrydumbo @dcexaminer @realDonaldTrump I saw the truth with this video within the first 30 minutes of the 2 hour footage.
@Nopesorrydumbo @dcexaminer @realDonaldTrump Interesting. What is MSM again?
@ChristianPost Umm you may want to make that more general... as in all Christians and not just Southern Baptists.
@AOC They mix up Socialism and Communism rather often and without regard to which is correct to use when they are making their statements.
@Nopesorrydumbo @StefanMolyneux Also, I am an ASL interpreter. I know when people are using signs to mock people.
@Nopesorrydumbo @StefanMolyneux No we were talking about how I don’t need to know the ins and outs of a topic to argue it. I don’t know squat about guns; but, I do know firearms is not in the Constitution.
Kamala Harris did that in 3 hours. https://t.co/5ROsw2FSIv

@Nopesorrydumbo @StefanMolyneux Argue? You don’t know me.		The cartridge was invented by a French infantryman in 1826. That is 35 years after the 2A was codified.		Did you know the word “firearm” does not appear anywhere in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, or any of the other Amendments.

@trish_regan @henfern_nyc I would rather the aide go to Puerto Rico. I am sure when they start selling America it’s oil again they will be flush.
@myry45 @larryelder @realDonaldTrump @JussieSmollett It because you are both racist and homophobic which is the reason you can’t answer that question.
@myry45 @larryelder @realDonaldTrump @JussieSmollett And tell me how you do know it for a fact.
@feministabulous @benshapiro Ben telling anyone they should sit out of anything is comical. Too bad he can’t take his own advice. Sit down and STFU.
@WashTimes If you gave the benefit of the doubt to OJ Simpson and KKKaFFFFFanaugh but not to Jussie, you are either racist or homophobic. Take your pick.
@tvbrad If  you gave the benefit of the doubt to OJ Simpson and KKKaFFFFFanaugh but not to Jussie, you are either racist or homophobic. Take your pick.
@bhweingarten Donald Trump lies more before he gets out of bed than Jussie did.		If you have given the benefit of the doubt to OJ Simpson and KKKaFFFFFanaugh but not to Jussie, you may be racist, homophobic, or both.		You may want to explore that.
@myry45 @larryelder @realDonaldTrump @JussieSmollett The same way the Nazis are homophobic. They denied they did anything to us.		Also, if you gave the benefit of the doubt to OJ Simpson and KKKaFFFFFanaugh but not to Jussie, you are either racist or homophobic. Take your pick.
@larryelder @realDonaldTrump @JussieSmollett I am starting to think you are homophobic because you are a homosexual. Only the ones still in the closet are that hateful.

@Bravewriting @MAGA96825 @MissJLH He is causing our problems.
@MAGA96825 @MissJLH @Bravewriting so if he doesn't get paid that means he isn't my president, right? because all public servants get paid. But trump wouldn't know what a servant is unless he is ordering them around and they are illegal in America.
@MAGA96825 @Bravewriting you do know there are steps one must take to enrich that right and just because you sell it doesn't mean you can enrich it properly until you have the skills and knowledge which Jared gave the Saudis, right?
@ChuckCallesto And? Trump bore false witness 20 times today before he made it out of bed.

@craigstewart101 @alltruelies @prageru YOU: "America is a relatively new oil exporter. In the past, we've gotten oil from OPEC under a number of different Presidents for a long, long time."		Like I said: flip flop.
@marcorubio Except for Trump and Rubio. They have to repeat a lie often enough in hopes that others will believe it.
I hope Jussie takes a page from the Covington Catholic boys and sues each person saying he made this up. Also, sue that show for cutting your part without any actual evidence you have done anything wrong. https://t.co/F5BFKUZAB9

@MAGA96825 @Bravewriting Says the person who supports the man who is giving nuclear weapons to the architects of 9/11. Very smart of you,yes?
@MAGA96825 @Bravewriting Interesting. Just like a pubic hair. Totally worthless. And when it gets caught, he yells and lies and gets red. You have no proof that it is a hoax and that is exactly what makes you a homophobe.
@Nopesorrydumbo @StefanMolyneux You dont know me. I dont care what you may think. You dont know me. You cant possibly know what I have seen.		The answer is I have seen the video and yes he mocked a reporter.

@thedailybeast "proven to be faulty"? This man hasn't even been charged with filking a false police report yet and you have already trumpeted the Nazi salute: Deny, Deny, Deny!
@craigstewart101 @alltruelies @prageru President Obama repealed the 40-year old crude oil export ban in 2015,
@GilmoreCharles @TalbertSwan If they agreed with something which was reported and didn't make up things which were not reported that would be a different story. 		They did not wait for the information. A lot of people were claiming it a hoax from the start. Those people are the ones I am talking about.
@CREWcrew So Jared gets $100 million for giving the Saudis nuclear secrets. Sounds about right for a Trump associate.
@travisakers @CNN I dont think I have ever watched CNN I have always seen them as lite right anyways.
@dcexaminer that is not the job of the FCC.
@RealSaavedra @benshapiro Republicans gave false testimony last week.		What's your point?		Homophobic?
@charliekirk11 I know the Washington Post has the 2 hour video of the interaction. I posted it to them.		I hope your side likes losing.		PS Them boys were in the wrong and their chaperones should have pulled them from the scene before anything started.
@prageru But only one declared a fake emergency.

@TheRickWilson I thought she was Assad from Hawaii.
@Bravewriting All these memes about me being triggered are going to be true if I see one more person say Jussie's hate crime experience is a hoax without any actual proof. I have been reporting those posts all day as a hate crime.
@HoarseWisperer Penske couldn't believe how eerily similar his case is to Flynn's.
@alltruelies @prageru then what happened to America and oil?
@prageru Actually, America stopped buying their products and instead preferred the oil and other products from journalist killing Saudis.
@prageru those boys were in the wrong. I saw the whole 2 hour video when they walked up and could have taken the advice of Republicans and just #WalkAway 		Instead they instigated and taunted.		Jesus tells us to turn the other cheek, not sue until you see fit.

@GilmoreCharles @TalbertSwan Do you say the same about blackface? What about OJ Simpson or KKKaFFFFFanaugh?
@Miduswell @Alicia_C_ I am not saying you are a racist. I believe we can all learn to not peddle in homophobia.		Why do straight people get more benefit of the doubt than gay people?
@Miduswell The denial of a hate crime is in fact its own hate crime.

@Terin2Ket @thecjpearson No. I am choosing to react to someone else offense towards me. Seems like you don’t know that a catalyst is.
@Terin2Ket @thecjpearson Perhaps you should go reread where the person said they were confronted by a straight white man who no doubt is that straight white male from Salt Lake City who punch a gay man holding a camera and twitter is trying to find his name.
@gdebenedetti They meant communism.		Socialism - Government controls the means of production (laws), distribution (Federal Register), and exchange (money or time for forgiveness of offenses).		All governments are a social contract and, therefore, are all themselves forms of socialism.

@Terin2Ket @thecjpearson It is a shame when Christians can’t even treat others how they wish to be treated and claim it is the other person’s fault. That is Pence logic.
@cindilove31 @thecjpearson Treat others how you wish to be treated. If you treat others poorly, don’t expect them to treat you like royalty.
