@Blueequus775 @HLawMediation The key word there is *may.*
@Blueequus775 @HLawMediation Oversimplified answer: After 6-8 consecutive years of boosters, a mare’s antibody response may not need annual boosters, because her immune system won’t allow for fertilization of an egg. That's why you carefully craft fertility control programs to account for such things.
@NeillVicki @EkbMary @Blueequus775 @HLawMediation Yes; however, that lag time is very individualized.
In case you missed yesterday's news: The spending package does contain some key protections for wild horses for the rest of the fiscal year, but there's much still to do. Thank you for everyone who spent time calling and writing Congress -- your effort paid off. #wildhorses https://t.co/rsdQjEIhxk

@HLawMediation I can be done. Sadly, BLM has never invested even 4% of its annual program budget on fertility control or other humane, on-range management tools and practices.
@HLawMediation Advantages of PZP include that it's somewhat reversible and *not* 100% effective, but, yes, having viable herds is always a priority. It's important that Congress is asking BLM to include fertility control in the plan it's demanding from the agency.
@HLawMediation Nonprofit sanctuaries lack the capacity for the number of horses being taken off the range, which is why we've pushed for 20 years for humanely addressing reproduction. We're looking at ways to get more wild horses out of holding corrals and onto less expensive pastures.

@Aja53John The SAFE Act died in committee during the last Congress. Despite having 218 House cosponsors and 30 Senate cosponsors, leadership chose not to bring it up for a vote. It was recently reintroduced in the House as HR 961.
@AdrienneC123 @beverlynichols Her name is Two Ponies. She's originally from the Calico Herd Management Area. She got her name because of markings that look like two horses.
@catsformede Agreed. Thousands of letters have been sent to Congress on that issue from our supporters alone. Lawmakers have been asking the agency for answers and not receiving them. That sales policy must be revoked immediately.
@FereJohn There are issues unaddressed (like BLM's new sales policy) that came to light after the FY19 appropriations process was well underway, but it's a victory for advocates that Congress has again included protective language for #wildhorses.

@Blueequus775 @lindaleblanc111 @beverlynichols Always part of the discussion. BLM has broad legal control over AML and there's a lengthy process in place.

@TDanevirke It's certainly been our experience communicating with the Navajo Nation, for example, that tribes struggle with decisions about what to do about wild horse management and how to pay for it. Some have horses dumped onto their land, which is difficult to stop.
@TDanevirke If you follow that link, it's mentioned in the local news story.
@TDanevirke It's important to note that there's disagreement within tribes, just as we disagree with BLM / USFS wild horse management. We urge the council to hear the voices of tribal members who want to see another solution.

@Cindyguarnieri1 Sanctuaries have limited space and resources. Not doing so would be irresponsible, would limit the number of horses that can be saved from slaughter and would mean not keeping family bands together, which we do.
@JoeyWesthead She only needs to be herself, that’s reason enough.
@EllenFreyta We’re a sanctuary, not the BLM. Using fertility control reduces but doesn’t eliminate births, allows us to keep family bands together, and has made it possible for us to rescue hundreds of horses that might otherwise have gone to slaughter.

@kikibobbi The SAFE Act would ban horse slaughter and transportation of horses for slaughter, but not how BLM manages wild horses. Insofar as a new law would send yet another signal to BLM that the American people want all horses treated humanely, though, that would be a good thing.
Former U.S. interior secretary lands first job since stepping down: https://t.co/Epy7esXAOp
@kikibobbi @Yo_se_tu @big_catsf @SandySharkey @Freedom4Horses @WildHorseEdu BLM's population targets have to be changed Herd Management Area by Herd Management Area, under the law, so it's a real challenge to try to get those numbers increased.

RT @ReturnToFreedom: Help #wildhorses by purchasing a 2019 RTF calendar! 100% of sales benefit the 540+ resident wild horses and burros at…
@big_catsf @Yo_se_tu @kikibobbi @SandySharkey @Freedom4Horses @WildHorseEdu Was only explaining why BLM opts to round up horses under the law, not justifying it. Livestock permits have been part of the law since 1934. BLM has been required to manage land for multiple uses: wild horses, livestock, wildlife, energy projects, recreation, etc., since 1976.
@Yo_se_tu @big_catsf @kikibobbi @SandySharkey @Freedom4Horses @WildHorseEdu Those that are sold (the horse's title passed over immediately) are burros or wild horses passed over for adoption three times or that are 10+ years old, under the law.
@Yo_se_tu @big_catsf @kikibobbi @SandySharkey @Freedom4Horses @WildHorseEdu Health problems*, pardon. An unknown number fall into the pipeline to slaughter in Canada or Mexico where slaughter is legal. They do so after being adopted or sold by BLM / USFS.
@Yo_se_tu @big_catsf @kikibobbi @SandySharkey @Freedom4Horses @WildHorseEdu Some do die during BLM's helicopter roundups or, also controversially, because BLM deems particular horses to have health. Most end up in govt. corrals or on leased pastures.
@Yo_se_tu @big_catsf @kikibobbi @SandySharkey @Freedom4Horses @WildHorseEdu Apologies. Twitter's character limit strikes again: BLM is the Bureau of Land Management, which, along with the U.S. Forest Service, was given oversight over wild horses on (federal) public land in 1971.
Some lovely photos and video of #wildhorses in Alberta. https://t.co/zb0Dhix9UY
@Yo_se_tu @big_catsf @kikibobbi @SandySharkey @Freedom4Horses @WildHorseEdu BLM has set a limit for the number of wild horses for each designated Herd Management Area, which wild horses (or burros) often must share with other wildlife and livestock. When the number of horses exceeds that limit, they're rounded up.

@foxmoorestates It’s one thing to get enough votes from appropriators for something temporary in a spending bill, another to get leaders to allow a vote on, and two full chambers to pass, a permanent ban. Comes down to whom voters elect and to whom those lawmakers then choose to listen.
@foxmoorestates The FY19 Ag approps bill passed by the House would bar USDA from hiring horsemeat inspectors. That would continue the temporary ban on horse slaughter within the U.S. until the end of September.
@foxmoorestates Which it does, but only until the end of the September.
ICYMI: Here's a photo of our sanctuary's newest little one. #foalfriday #wildhorses #thephotohour https://t.co/lhABGDPAfH
The Agriculture bill would bar the U.S.D.A. from hiring horsemeat inspectors, continuing the effective ban on horse slaughter within the United States for another year. 3/3
In the Interior bill, the House again included language that Congress has used for many years that prohibits the Bureau of Land Management from killing healthy, unadopted #wildhorses or burros or selling them to slaughter. 2/3

Stella, a beautiful grulla mare was born at the sanctuary in 2003, after her own mother, Emilita, arrived pregnant following a roundup at the Sulphur Herd Management Area in Utah. Nora’s sire is Amante, a stallion originally from the Cerbat mountains of Arizona. 4/4
Confident little Nora has already shown herself to be independent, curious and smart. She began whinnying at the feed truck when she was less than a week old, even though she wasn’t yet eating hay. 3/4
Because our sanctuary uses the fertility control vaccine PZP, births at the sanctuary are a rare but happy event.  Stella is what we call a “non-responder” to PZP, so she may foal every few years. 2/4

In 2016, for example, it used 67% of its program budget to round up and remove #wildhorses -- compared to .61% spent on fertility control. https://t.co/jnnduQM9mi

@GhostHorse3 It's similar to the new BLM policy. Anyone buying a horse from USFS and taking it to slaughter will be breaking California law, but it's difficult to stop.
@GhostHorse3 @FreeWildHorses @AGBecerra We're waiting on more complete information from USFS, but it is similar to what USFS has already been doing only at lower cost. Concern about kill buyers remains, just clarifying when sales "with / without restrictions" planned.

@GhostHorse3 @FreeWildHorses @AGBecerra See our most recent tweet. I think any confusion is over both a restricted sale planned for *December* 18th and unrestricted sale planned for *February* 18th. Hopefully, the latter will never happen.
Clarification: USFS is selling captured older horses for $1 apiece on Dec. 18 -- with restrictions again slaughter. USFS is tentatively planning on Feb. 18 for sale without restrictions, pending the outcome of lawsuits by RTF and others to stop the unrestricted sale. https://t.co/uNfi1Uxpqn

@Resident90042 Traffic safety is one that's coming up more often as a reason. Calling a roundup an emergency allows the agency to go around the normal planning process when, for instance, fencing and other measures might be used but the public is unable to make a case for more humane solutions.
@Resident90042 In this case, the alleged "emergency" wasn't the day-to-day health of the animals but traffic safety concerns along a highway.

Thanks to everyone for their kind words about Sutter, who died this morning. Throughout much of his 32-year life, he was the first wild horse that many children and adults had the chance to meet. Here's his 2016 @ASPCA Horse of the Year video: https://t.co/Qpffkaxuyl #wildhorses
Thank you, Meg, for your lovely post and for all of the photos -- and to all of the friends of Sutter and RTF who've been sharing their memories with us. On a sad day, it's been a wonderful reminder of all the lives touched by Sutter and his story. https://t.co/Jo2SPuKDvr
Today, we said goodbye to Sutter, a 32-year-old stallion with a heart of gold. The survivor of a roundup and an abusive adoption, he became an ambassador for #wildhorses. He was both the first ASPCA Horse of the Year and Horse Stars Hall of Fame inductee born on the range. https://t.co/FSgEShfinc

@foxmoorestates No, this is our sanctuary for 500 wild horses and 42 burros, most the product of government roundups. Stumpy was among the wild horses captured earlier this week from a herd management in Utah and is now at a BLM holding facility in Delta, Utah.
Whether you are a photographer, or just want to experience the joy of observing wild horses free-roaming on 2,000 acres, we have several upcoming opportunities to visit our San Luis Obispo sanctuary. 		For more information, or to register, please visit:	https://t.co/X7NN5i9ZRy

We have amazing wild horses that we purchased from BLM for $10 apiece to keep them from going to slaughter. See the story on our home page about Black Moon.
@Pass10nn $20 for a 100-pound bale is what we're paying our supplier, from the hay field to the horses and burros. In 2017, we spent about $265,000 on hay. That doesn't include the cost of leasing pastures, etc., just the feed itself.

@urbanhorsedoc The association has taken stances differing from us on wild horses in the past. It's not many an equine vet that sees these surgeries in unsterile environments as anything other than unnecessarily risking the lives of mares -- especially when fertility control is available.

@EkbMary @Blueequus775 Congress and the administration can change policy. The administration has called for killing "excess" horses, so our focus is Congress not making it worse while moving BLM toward humane management. See our pinned tweet.

@Freedom4Horses Just awful. Not a cause of death we've seen recently during a helicopter roundup. Almost all deaths are horses being put down for what BLM deems pre-existing conditions, like what the agency says are poorly healed injuries.
@A1471 In 1993, farmers in that area of Arizona began complaining about wild horses. The BLM treated them as strays and removed them, though others recall horses routinely being killed or captured and removed by locals for decades.
@A1471 They aren't because BLM removed earlier generations of them. They went to a sanctuary and, later, were impounded by state gov't until we and other nonprofits, with the support of donors, rescue and rehomed more than 900 horses (incl. 120 Gilas) that would have gone to slaughter.
One wild horse was put down for reasons unknown and two colts died of capture shock on the second day of the helicopter roundup in Wyoming's Red Desert complex. Already, at least 347 #wildhorses have lost their freedom. https://t.co/oPjfBxM0UR RTF file photo by Steve Paige. https://t.co/5xfBQvjJCr

Good news on Wednesday that Colorado State won't take part in a sterilization study on wild Oregon mares, but we need Congress to drop an appropriations bill amendment funding such surgeries and handing the Interior Secretary power to decide if a herd can reproduce. #wildhorses https://t.co/Gfah0jpHuN
@xsuzi00 Ain't happened yet. Better to call Congress than hope for acts of nature.
@krummel503 A person who did so would only jeopardize the lives of wild horses fleeing terrified from a helicopter. BLM would only extend the roundup -- it wouldn't pack up and go home. Also? The agency comes to roundups armed and trap sites are in wide-open spaces.
@krummel503 Not unless they want to go to jail, I'd venture.

@dlt57 The BLM has a great deal of flexibility under the 1971 Act, including managing sales. That's why there's suggested call language in the post urging Congress to demand BLM revoke the new sales policy of up to 25 horses with no waiting period. More work needs to be done.
@JDobroszczyk It means what the post says: The Senate funding package prohibits killing healthy wild horses and burros with our tax dollars. It also doesn't promote sterilization, like the House version. Roundups remain legal under the 1971 Act. There's more work to be done.

@yosemitehker We support humane, science-based management. An active fertility control program *is* management, for instance. PZP has been a key tool at our sanctuary and key to the changes on the range for which we've been advocating for 20 years.
@yosemitehker Water / fencing are ongoing -- legitimate issues -- there. Point is, BLM could have gone through the normal planning process before but is instead relying increasingly on labeling roundups as "emergencies" and in that way avoiding public input and discussion of other options.
@yosemitehker Opposed -- in no small part because it's being labeled an "emergency" when issues there like fencing are long-standing. BLM should go through the NEPA process, weighing options and consequences. By making it an "emergency" (at least in name), it's avoiding public process.
@yosemitehker As for debates over "native wildlife," the fossil record shows that horses were here dating back 50 million years and went through the stages of their development here. We call them a reintroduced native species.
@yosemitehker Some seem unaware that the range is already managed and that the law as written requires multiple-use management of federal land. No corner of the globe is free of human influence, so humans must make better decisions and mitigate for our negative impacts (see: climate change).

Blindness is sometimes listed, too. One wonders why that's necessary if the horse manages with the help of herdmates -- and just ran a long distance into the trap.

@michellelynne__ If no one watches roundups, the treatment of wild horses can be far worse. Humane witnesses not only keep the public informed about what's being done with their tax dollars but can get changes made that increase the safety of the animals during a roundup.

@Freedom4Horses @Onegreystray Glad you're back. Pacing yourself and self-care are so, so important for advocates.
Managing #wildhorses through sterilization would endanger individual animals while threatening the diversity and health of whole herds. Costly, unproven field surgeries are made needless by the availability of humane solutions, Read more, take action: https://t.co/iwghHJOaOy https://t.co/BdH0TN3yqS
@auinger2 We love our resident burros! They're such characters -- and very clever. At our Lompoc sanctuary, they live in an oak forest. At San Luis Obispo, they have the run of the place. How much we see them tends to be up to them. Sometimes, they're curious; other times, mysterious.

@Prairierose55P @4Mina BLM spends tax money hand over fist on wild horses; it doesn't profit. Because of how Congress set up grazing fee laws, BLM loses millions more on livestock. So the management is awful for wild horses &amp; burros--but also bad for Americans footing the bill for roundups they oppose.
@Prairierose55P @4Mina Under the so-called Burns rider or Burns amendment or sale authortiy or "three-strikes rule" -- pick a name  -- BLM can sell horses / burros passed over for adoption three times or that are ages 10-older.
@Prairierose55P @4Mina BLM sold 582 horses in 2017 compared to rounding up 4,209. The money is made by contractors and those who own corrals and the pastures the government leases for captured horses.

@RachBach007 Because there are about 90 on that satellite sanctuary, already, through the generosity of the good-hearted landowners. Altogether, we care for about 540 wild horses and burros, including 120 rescued from likely slaughter last year, and are at capacity without more land / money.

@MrJulianslink00 Reversible, proven fertility control vaccine used judiciously on specific herd management areas as part of a plan to keep wild horses and burros on the range &gt; proposed unsafe, untested and inhumane sterilization surgeries performed in the field with no big-picture plan, at all.
Since 2007, BLM has not spent more than 3.94% of its annual wild horse program budget on safe, effective fertility control vaccines. BLM’s failure to implement PZP has resulted in 46,431 #wildhorses warehoused at a cost of about $47.5 million annually. https://t.co/i3TwsED3sK https://t.co/CxsFiAy4qP
@simonson5113 There's no multiplying happening at the sanctuary these days--except for when we discover an occasional mare doesn't respond to PZP. Last year, we had one foal (not counting foals in the rescued 120-member Gila herd, which included pregnant mares when we received them).
You occasionally see one, and it’s the thrill of a lifetime. But mostly all you ever see is a cloud of dust after they are gone.

@LightOnIt1 @Elgianne @EkbMary @CyntWhite HR 113 / S. 1706 are the SAFE Act bills: horse slaughter / transport of horses for slaughter.
@Ferazi1 On slaughter? Not so. On the Senate side, Susan Collins is another. There are about 20 GOP cosponsors in the House and the bill's author is a Republican.

@EkbMary @Elgianne @CyntWhite Looking at SAFE cosponsors is one way to gauge interest in horse issues, but know that not all SAFE cosponsors are on the right side of the wild horse issue.

We don't disagree with you about "overpopulation," at all. The numbers are staggeringly one-sided on public land. Unfortunately, the current Congress is not going to push BLM to dramatically reduce livestock numbers and create a more equitable situation. Elections matter. https://t.co/Xt3BM8eRCN
