Now it is our time to chart a course that will make Texas even better, not just for the next four years, but for the next 40 years. #TXSotS
Texas was built on bold ideas. It was built by the men and women who came before us, who worked together to make Texas the most exceptional state in the nation. #TXSotS
What we must accomplish requires all of us working together on bold ideas. #TXSotS
This is a transformative agenda. People inside and outside the Capitol can see we are on the threshold of something extraordinary. #TXSotS
This session we can and we will ensure that the men and women who fought on the front lines go to the front of the line for the best services Texas can provide.  #TXSotS
This session, I ask that you work with me to build a support system that empowers veterans to overcome challenges. #TXSotS
Texas has made tremendous strides to better support our veterans. But this session we have an opportunity to do even more. #TXSotS
Texas is home to more than 1.6 million veterans. #TXSotS
We must not turn our backs on the service and sacrifice of the men and women who have worn the uniform of the most powerful military in the history of the world. #TXSotS
Whether it’s cracking down on human trafficking or eliminating the backlog of rape kits, I know we can get the job done. #TXSotS
Together we must provide more funding to eliminate the backlog and deliver justice that has been denied for too long. #TXSotS
One of the most important tools we have is forensic testing of rape kits. But thousands of these kits have languished untested for far too long. This session we will right this wrong. #TXSotS
We must also do more to ensure justice for survivors of rape and sexual assault. #TXSotS
I ask the Legislature to increase funding to create six regional human trafficking squads to investigate and shut down human trafficking operations throughout Texas.  #TXSotS
We must also work together to crack down on human trafficking and to protect the victims of this heinous crime. #TXSotS
Together, we will put more gang members behind bars. We will dismantle their criminal enterprises and we will make our neighborhoods safer for our families. #TXSotS
I’m calling for two new anti-gang centers in Waco and Tyler to help those communities rid their regions of dangerous gangs. #TXSotS
TAG Centers are hubs where law enforcement agencies at all levels share resources and intelligence so they can work together to crack down on gang activity and put these criminals behind bars. #TXSotS https://t.co/adiO60QTQK
Texas has developed a winning strategy with our six Texas Anti-Gang Centers. #TXSotS
We must do more to crack down on the treacherous gangs that bring drugs, weapons and violence into our communities. #TXSotS
To give the Legislature time this session to make Texas more resilient to future disasters, I am making Disaster Preparedness and response an emergency item. #TXSotS https://t.co/MV18m560SZ
We must create an emergency management structure that cuts through all the red tape that slows the delivery of funds and supplies to our communities. #TXSotS
We must apply the lessons of Hurricane Harvey and continue to improve the way Texas responds to natural disasters. #TXSotS
In the face of the greatest natural disaster our state has ever seen, our fellow Texans show the world that no earthly force is more powerful than Texan spirit. #TXSotS
This isn’t just about restraining the growth of property taxes, it’s about restoring power to the people of Texas. #TXSotS
If we are going to keep Texas the economic engine of America, we must rein in a property tax system that punishes families and businesses and prevents younger Texans from achieving their dream of homeownership. #TXSotS
Speaking of emergencies, Property Tax Reform is an emergency. #TXSotS https://t.co/cAwwTKGY5L

And where every student graduates with more than just a diploma. #TXSotS
Working together, we will create a Texas where every student is reading at grade level by the time they finish the third grade. #TXSotS
We must provide incentives to put effective teachers in the schools and classrooms where they are needed most. #TXSotS https://t.co/7QM3N4HxAu
Texas must recruit and retain the best and brightest teachers to educate students. This session, we must pay our teachers more. #TXSotS
Other than parents, no one is more vital to our students’ education than teachers. #TXSotS
We must target education funding to help our students advance in school. That starts with teachers in the classroom. #TXSotS
This session, we have a unique window of opportunity to tackle challenges that have plagued Texas for more than a generation. #TXSotS
And passed laws that crack down on dangerous gangs and human traffickers who threaten our citizens. #TXSotS https://t.co/upotxQ10Ce
Last #txlege, we provided rifle-resistant vests to our law enforcement officers, keeping them safer as they risk their lives to protect our communities. #TXSotS
The 85th #txlege acted in bipartisan fashion to protect the most vulnerable children in Texas by reforming a broken foster care and child protective system. #TXSotS
Not only is Texas smarter, we’re also safer. #TXSotS

Business expansions in Texas from Amarillo to Brownsville, in Lufkin and Mt. Pleasant, Temple and Paris, are a result of the Texas Enterprise Fund, which promotes economic diversification. #TXSotS

We should demand the federal government do two things: leave us alone &amp; let Texans govern Texas #TXSotS https://t.co/c95CEsB5Ap
We need a Convention of States -- authorized by the Constitution -- to propose amendments. #TXSotS
It has increasingly abandoned the Constitution, stiff-armed the states and ignored its citizens. #TXSotS
For decades, the federal government has grown out of control. #TXSotS
I'm making Ethics Reform an emergency item. Voters deserve to know if officials are working for them. #TXSotS https://t.co/LpAZ97jy7N
It’s time to let Texans know which elected officials have government contracts paid for by taxpayers. #TXSotS
The faith that People have in their democracy is linked to the trust they have in their elected officials. #TXSotS
Central to keeping Texas the bastion of liberty in America, we need to shore up cracks in our democratic process. #TXSotS
We must cut spending in our current biennium to ensure we live within our budget. #TXSotS
Texans know how to live within their means. No less should be expected from their government. #TXSotS
We need property tax reform that prevents cities from raising taxes without voter approval. #TXSotS
No government should be able to tax people out of their homes. #TXSotS
Another way for #Texas to grow jobs is by cutting taxes &amp; regulations. #TXSotS
#Texas has made great strides on tort reform. But our work is not done. Hail-storm litigation is the newest form of lawsuit abuse. #TXSotS
The Texas Enterprise Fund has added jobs from Amarillo to the RGV. #TXSotS
In 2yrs the Texas Enterprise Fund has attracted more than a half a billion dollars in capital investment &amp; added thousands of new jobs.
Every man &amp; every woman in #Texas should have greater opportunity for economic advancement. #TXSotS
30 states have school choice. This session, let's make #Texas the 31st. #TXSotS
No child should be in the wrong school because of their zip code. #TXSotS
Parents, not government, are best positioned to make decisions about their child’s education. #TXSotS
When it comes to education we need to remember that one size doesn’t fit all. #TXSotS
With a sense of urgency, we must create better ways to fund education. #TXSotS
We are working to address the growing demand on our Charter Schools. #TXSotS
We must do more to help our public schools educate our children. #TXSotS

What must be stopped is illegal Immigration, &amp; worse, the criminals who conspire with cartels that enter the U.S. illegally. #TXSotS

READ my State of the State speech and more about my plan for Texas. http://t.co/fShMHDDfB2 #TXSotS
Working together, we will keep Texas the leading state in this nation. #TXSotS
My blueprint for TX outlined: Prohibiting lawmakers from voting on legislation from which they could financially benefit. #TXSotS
My blueprint for TX outlined: Requiring elected officials to disclose contracts they have with public entities. #TXSotS
Let’s strengthen the faith, the confidence &amp; the trust Texans deserve from their leaders. #TXSotS
I will expand liberty in Texas by signing a law that makes Texas the 45th state to allow Open Carry. #TXSotS
The more we RESTRAIN the growth of government the more we will EMPOWER the PRIVATE SECTOR to drive the TX economy. #TXSotS
That is why my budget requires most state agencies to REDUCE their general revenue spending by 3%. #TXSotS
Texas families have to live within a budget, government should too. #TXSotS
To keep Texas the premiere model for opportunity we must constrain the size of government and maximize the liberty of individuals. #TXSotS
To keep Texas fiscally strong, the time has come to begin reducing the state's debt. #TXSotS
This property tax reduction includes an appropriation that makes school districts whole for any tax revenue they might lose. #TXSotS
My plan calls for a $2 billion reduction in the business franchise tax and a $2.2 billion reduction in the property tax burden. #TXSotS
I will REJECT any budget that does not include GENUINE tax relief to Texas employers and job creators.#TXSotS
While our jobs creation is legendary, many states are overhauling their economic development programs to compete with Texas. #TXSotS
To help people with disabilities and seniors my budget adds more funding for in-home care attendants. #TXSotS
To get and keep more doctors in Texas my budget increases the number of residency positions funded in Texas. #TXSotS
My Budget also increases funding for screening and treatment for post-partum depression. #TXSotS
Increased funding for women’s health programs for more access to care like cancer screenings and checkups. #TXSotS
Not all wounds are seen. My budget includes funding to provide mental health screenings to veterans and service members. #TXSotS
I’m calling for legislation to WAIVE licensing exams &amp; fees for vets w/ the required training &amp; practical experience gained in the military.
My budget also exempts new businesses formed by veterans from paying state franchise taxes for the first 5 years.#TXSotS
NEW businesses, formed by veterans, will be exempt from having to pay state registration fees to open their businesses. #TXSotS
Saying “thank you” is not enough. We must do more to help Vets so they can enjoy their own economic freedom. #TXSotS
RT @utsystem: Thank you @GovAbbott: "To elevate #higherEd, we need to enhance #research programs &amp; attract nationally recognized researcher…
Texas is the proud home to almost 2 million veterans, active duty military, Reserve, National Guard and their families. #TXSotS
We must remember the hardship such long deployment puts on our National Guard troops, their families &amp; on their careers. #TXSotS
As soon as the DPS has deployed permanent resources to secure our border we can bring home our dedicated National Guard troops. #TXSotS
As Governor, I have identified funds to keep the National Guard in place until the Legislature acts. #TXSotS
The reality is that DPS cannot recruit, train and deploy 500 new troopers overnight. It takes time to ramp up. #TXSotS
To protect our borders, my plan adds 500 new state troopers and more Texas Rangers who can focus on corruption. #TXSotS
The last lawsuit I filed as AG was to stop the President's executive action. Last night a federal judge halted the executive action. #TXSotS
Texas communities &amp; families cannot prosper if they are not safe. #TXSotS
We need to ensure @TxDOT has the sustainable, recurring, &amp; predictable revenue needed to plan large-scale multi-yr construction projects.
Funding comes from 3 places: Prop 1, diversions of TX highway funds &amp; dedicating 1/2 of the existing motor vehicle sales tax to fund roads.
My budget adds more than $ 4 billion a year to building roads in Texas without raising taxes, fees, tolls, or debt. #TXSotS
It’s a sad day in Texas when we have countless roads where a guy in a wheelchair can move faster than our congested traffic. #TXSotS
With the passage of Prop 1 this past Nov., Texans sent a loud &amp; clear message that they are tired of being stuck in traffic. #TXSotS
Another fundamental responsibility of govt is to build the roads Texans need. #TXSotS
Research scholars at @tamu College Station &amp; Prairie View A&amp;M include 3 Nobel Laureates and 11 members of National Academies. #TXSotS
The Chancellor’s Research Initiative at the @TAMU System has been recruiting the world’s foremost research scholars. #TXSotS
To elevate higher ed, we need to enhance research programs &amp; attract nationally recognized researchers &amp; Nobel Laureates to TX univ. #TXSotS
We need to expand &amp; support TX community colleges that serve as the gateway to better jobs &amp; step toward further edu opportunities.  #TXSotS
Read about Justin Friend's success after attending Texas State Technical College in Waco  http://t.co/D42QknmBTH #TXSotS
Different students have different needs. Our employers are DEMANDING that we better prepare our students for workforce needs. #TXSotS
Just like with primary &amp; secondary education, Higher Education doesn't work in a one size fits all approach. #TXSotS
We must assist in making college more affordable and accessible. #TXSoTS
Grand Prairie improved grad rates over 7 yrs w/ 20% gains among Hispanic, African-American &amp; Economically Disadvantaged students. #TxSotS
Grand Prairie ISD is an open enrollment school district that shows substantial student achievement. #TXSotS
Hear Keisha Riley's story on school choice. http://t.co/Irk5hKi2rY
Parental involvement is critical to student advancement. When parents have more options, students win.  #TXSotS
Let’s allow school districts to OPT OUT of parts of education code so they can best fit their community needs. #TXSotS
My budget invests in more STEM teachers &amp; in teachers who serve our most disadvantaged students.  #TXSotS
Better schools is TX ensuring that our classrooms have the best teachers, and that means saying NO to COMMON CORE.  #TXSotS
To begin the process of building a better education system in Texas we must improve early education. #TXSotS
Pre-K through 3rd grade teachers w/world-class Literacy &amp; Math Achievement Academies to help our students advance further.  #TXSotS
My budget provides additional funding for schools that adopt high-quality Pre-K grograms. #TXSotS
Our goal should be to ensure all TX students are performing at grade level in reading &amp; math by the time they finish 3rd grade. #TXSotS
We can be #1 in education if we apply the same tenacity &amp; commitment to education as we do jobs. #TXSotS
Today I submitted a budget that charts a course that will keep Texas  No. 1. #TXSotS
Texas leads the nation because of our greatest resource- the people of TX. #TXSotS
TX has been #1 in the nation for creating jobs &amp; in 2014 we created more jobs than any year in the history of TX. #TXSotS
