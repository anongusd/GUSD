@aussieintel @LakeLorene @OMGno2trump There is a strong "us/ them" aspect to R policy &amp; politics. They think of themselves as an exclusive club to which only the crème de la crème need apply. Their policies are meant to benefit that club &amp; keep it in power -- HARD TO DO in a democracy when the club is outnumbered!
@aussieintel @LakeLorene @OMGno2trump Our Const'n is outmoded &amp; antiquated. Trump voters ARE NOT a Maj &amp; far right ideology IS NOT (&amp; NEVER HAS BEEN) mainstream. Traditionally, our voting public responds to subtle cues ("dog whistles"). Trump turned it up x10 &amp; reached out to fringe elements who SELDOM VOTE!
@aussieintel @LakeLorene @OMGno2trump Upon study, you'll find strong "buyers remorse" causing GWB voters to go for Obama. 		To some extent, EVERY POTUS has stoked racism in this country. Politicians find American racism an easy AND POWERFUL impulse to manipulate -- which is why it's so EASY for a demagogue to win.
@LakeLorene @aussieintel @OMGno2trump Yea... "it's telling!" THERE WAS NO ELECTORAL COLLEGE IN THE MIDTERMS!!
@aussieintel @OMGno2trump No. The 60's was A MUCH BETTER TIME in our politics. The leaders we had then -- "ike," Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, &amp;c[.] -- WHILE FLAWED, were of A SUPERIOR CALIBER to the politicians in power now.
@DrYardSale @OMGno2trump This entire surreal episode reminds me of when Mel Gibson, in "The Patriot," said "Why trade ONE tyrant 3,000 miles away for 3,000 tyrants ONE mile away -- an elected legislature can trample a man's rights as easily as a king can!"
@exacbabe @OMGno2trump @kstreet111 I gotta say, the GOP rode the wave until Mueller shot the wheels off!
@WonderMike @OMGno2trump No. NOW, protecting him is "aiding &amp; abetting" since HIS OWN GOVT says he's a criminal; before, they could claim ignorance of [the full extent of] his crimes. It's bad enough that some lawmakers, no doubt, are caught up -- those are the examples!
@OMGno2trump To, publicly &amp; in govt documents, call the president a criminal means that overthrowing him couldn't be called "a coup," it'd just be ARRESTING A CRIMINAL in a country where EVERYBODY is subject to the rule of law!!!

@politico So many Democratic presidential prospects are now claiming the progressive mantle in advance of the 2020 primaries that liberal leaders are trying to institute a measure of ideological quality control

@BenSasse On MY SIDE, WE TAKE IT SERIOUSLY!		One might say we take it too seriously; but, how can we not with so many life/ death issues at stake. I'd argue that IT'S BETTER THAN RELIGION. Doing things our way, you could "give unto Caesar," help your neighbor, AND help yourself! 		#IMHO
@BenSasse Because of presidential showmanship &amp; combativeness, it's easy to think of once stale policy debates as sporting events. I believe that's how THIS POTUS gets/ keeps people engaged. The downside is, on the R side, (it doesn't seem like) nobody's taking it seriously.
@BenSasse ...I wouldn't compare it to religion, though. 		In the Trump "era," one could compare politics to sports. To me, gangs of people arguing on social media about policy matters is the virtual equivalent of a British soccer brawl.
@BenSasse "... extremists on both sides?"		Perhaps, I would "consider the argument" if more people were politically engaged. In my circle, there isn't MUCH civic participation (OR RELIGION) to go around! 		Having said that, I agree with the author... There, definitely, IS A DYNAMIC!
@RonHogan It's impossible to judge somebody's religious (or "religious") convictions. Many people go their whole lives NEVER KNOWING where they are spiritually &amp;/ or religiously. Many people, also, just "go thru the motions" without being sure of their own motives! 		Otherwise, GREAT READ

@iancyates We already know that half the voting age adults in our country either won't, or CAN'T[!!!], vote... But, what if half of the other half was just pulling that lever JUST TO BE DOING IT -- without a coherent THOUGHT about WHAT they were doing[!!!]??? WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN?	4)
@iancyates Are we, now, in the era of "communication politics?" Is it, now, the norm to go to the polls to vent one's frustrations &amp; use that PRECIOUS ballot to "communicate" with gov't? ...if so, what does that mean for the future of our country &amp; how would it affect our lives[!]?	3)
@iancyates We just elected Rashida Tlaib, the FIRST Muslim woman EVER in Congress. We're familiar with her &amp;, personally, I don't think Sanders/AOC endorsement made any difference; but, I think other people in my district want(ed) to send a STRONG message to DC, esp to Trump!	2)
@iancyates Healthcare is, without a doubt, a very important issue for us ALL. Whether &amp; you what extent it's a "winning issue" -- according to my reading -- seems to depend on which district is being discussed, even among D districts. I live in MI-XIII. 	1)
