Even better @PressSec start every press conference with something like "OK @Acosta go ahead, it's about you, take all the time you need. These are other people can't wait to hear how brilliant you are. They would rather sit here quiet while you demonstrate your genius......Begin"

it's amazing to watch the twitter accts of the MSM. All the pics they are posting #ChristineBlaseyFord are weepy and sympathetic and all the pics #BrettKavanaugh show some level of anger.
