Health care bill ensures contraception coverage, not abortion coverage. This angers women's groups and conservative religious groups alike.
When you say "we want to work with Congress," that means you either don't have a plan or don't want to offend them by offering it. #debate
Ryan is offering the best explanation of Republican tax policy I've heard. #debate
While on the generational warfare, let's not forget which generation each of these guys are in: Biden showcases age. Ryan shows freshness
Biden once said at a Senate Judiciary markup: "I forgot how much fun this is!" #debate
Biden talks down to youngster: Bibi has been my friend for 39 years. Oh, and btw, I also have access to classified information. #debate
Rhetorical whammies: "track you to the gates of hell" (Biden), "unraveling of the Obama foreign policy" (Ryan) #debate
My NJ colleagues and I are going to offer running analysis during the VP #debate here. http://t.co/fwVfkqWm. Think taxes will come up?
Detwiler warms up for do or die game. @Nationals http://t.co/I4eWYjUR
Dear @nationals. I love you no matter what happens today. BUT the chocolate chip cookies I packed are weak consolation. Good luck!
So when do we get that thing? Where you put in a pinch hitter in a do or die situation and he hits a Homerun? @nationals @BresPolitico
Oh well. @BresPolitico
Cool! Yankees are losing.
“@Advocate4Tech:  are you both at the game?? :)” my bad. Not @reploiscapps. It was Rep. Lynn Woolsey. I mix up my Calif. ladies.

Observation #2 from @jasonjdick: "Just think if Harper could get on base... at all." #nationals
Observation from @jasonjdick: Jordan	Zimmerman can get a hit, but Bryce Harper can't. Got it. #nationals

At least our #nationals pitchers are way handsome. #brightspot
@FranTownsend @davidgregory Hey, I bet that was me! Just one criticism: he would cut ed funding. I count 1 lobbyist, 2 journos there too.
Awesome new word from WaPo's @MrDanZak: "unwonk"  http://t.co/ZInjADAN
My favorite terms from the #debate: Romney="economy tax" Obama="economic patriotism"
FYIW, here's my analysis of Romney's school choice plan: #debate http://t.co/YS1X6SDK
Romney: I'm not going to cut funding for education." Technically, if he endorses the Ryan plan, that is not true. #debate
More from campaign stump speech, Obama proud of getting rid of private sector student loans. #debate
Romney hammers on school choice proposal, which would require federal regulation, btw. #debate
Notice how Obama returns to education theme: 100,000 math and science grads, etc. It is a staple of his campaign ads #debate
More things Romney likes: Teachers. He has not said what he thinks about teachers unions. Of course, neither has Obama #debate.
Fact: On Race to the Top, 46 states made changes but only 19 won awards. #debate
Romney brings up classic "my way or the highway" complaint. Classic because it is uttered by Rs and Ds alike in Congress nonstop. #debate
More things Romney likes: private market, individual responsibility. #debate
There goes that word, "bipartisan." Romney wins for bringing it up first. Obama wins for noting that HCR was Republican idea. #debate
Abandoned (for now) Medicare conversation spells out the key difference between Obama and Romney: government v private sector. #debate
More things Romney likes: regulation, green energy. #denverdebate
Repeal Obamacare and seniors pay, says Obama. That is has been a R worry all along; if the program gets entrenched, harder to take away.
Nice pivot from corporate taxes to college and teachers, Obama! Not sure the connection is that direct, but it works politically. #debate
Romney likes Big Bird and PBS. Obama likes the term "Obamacare."  #denverdebate
Being way over the time limit on taxes should surprise no one when it comes to domestic policy. Nothing else matters. #denverdebate
Each time a candidate utters "$5 trillion," it's a win for Obama. #denverdebate
Job training never is the voter winner that it should be: Romney wants to privatize govt job training, streamline programs. #debates
Obama's schtick tuition rates comes right at the top--big campaign issue, popular with voters. Irony:WH can't do much about it #denverdebate
I'll be tweeting analysis of the #debate.Immigration a big topic. Check it out with my smart NJ colleagues here: https://t.co/WLFrbltj

He was also 35. MT @jimtankersley: You know who wasn't limited to 160 innings in his first season after Tommy John surgery? Tommy John.
