@Purphexyon @BostonSophie @Hasanda_BK @thehill Honey, I've dated black women. I've seen the face of my very good black friend get blown off in Viet NAM and cried. I have and always have had MANY black &amp; Hispanic friends.  YOU don't have the right to pull that dem card and call me raciest!! AND OBAMA IS HALF BLACK!!!!!!
@Purphexyon @BostonSophie @Hasanda_BK @thehill Because you want them banned and don't even know what they are...like most of your fights - no logic, just it's not what the other side wants.
@Purphexyon @BostonSophie @Hasanda_BK @thehill My rage did NOT begin when a (one half) black man became president. It began when he started ruining this country, kissing the ass of world leader's, leading from behind, destroying our military, etc., etc., etc.
@Purphexyon @BostonSophie @Hasanda_BK @thehill Nah! No threats. Your peeps carry lighters to set neighborhoods on fire and rocks and such to break windows. And tell me, sweet pea, the REAL definition of an assault weapon...
@Purphexyon @BostonSophie @Hasanda_BK @thehill Oh I have no problem with  it. Just remember to apply the same "logic" to it when we have had enough and do the same. And, we're the ones who believe in the second amendment.
@Purphexyon @BostonSophie @Hasanda_BK @thehill And tat, my dear, is EXACTLY what I'm talking about. Your "unessary violence &amp; aggression" translates into UC Berkley when a conservative  trust to speak or BLM shouting "pigs in a blanket fry them like bacon". Doesn't sound like "taking it on" to me... Just sayin!!!!!
@Purphexyon @BostonSophie @Hasanda_BK @thehill But, I can see why you wanted Hillary. If she had been elected we would NEVER know how criminal she was/is and how Obama,  the DOJ &amp; FBI were her puppets - not impartial as demanded in OUR constitution. All pointing to a fact - THERE IS A GOD!!!
@Purphexyon @BostonSophie @Hasanda_BK @thehill Honey, I'm nearly 72. I am not in ANY way desperate - except to leave a better world for my children &amp; grandchildren. And, I'm wise enough to know I won't if the US elects more morons who lead from behind, send 10's of billions of dollars to terrorists, etc.
@Purphexyon @BostonSophie @Hasanda_BK @thehill AND A GREAT deal more productive and fun than trying to get any logic, intellegence or common sense from snowflakes. YOU people just HATE.
