Priests, pastors and imams	Once seen as a noble profession	Now recognizable as nefarious manipulators with perverse and inaccurate agendas
Fewer people are as repugnant as priests, pastors or imams.	They either are painfully ignorant.	Or hucksters of the worst kind.
Religion is a slime that coats and infects an impressionable mind. 	A filthy infection sadly acquired through childhood indoctrination.
