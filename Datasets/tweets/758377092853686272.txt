@RShivashankarMD @TJUHospital @EdwardLoftus2 @AustinChiangMD An allergy to corn (ubiquitous and exempt from FDA labeling requirements) could be the culprit in IBD (per testimonies from members of our corn allergy groups of over 10K members)	February, 2019, Month-End Corn Allergy Stats: 779.1% Increase in 68 Months	https://t.co/GBqlnIsTo6
@faactnews Corn should be added, since it's ubiquitous and exempt from FDA labeling requirements.  It can be just as lethal as any of the Top 8 allergens.	February, 2019, Month-End Corn Allergy Statistics: 779.1% Increase in 68 Months	https://t.co/GBqlnIsTo6
@AmyMyersMD Caution: I haven't eaten beef since 2014 after nearly dying from antibiotic-tainted grass-fed beef (I'm allergic to all but one antibiotic). It caused a 7-week reaction for which there was no antidote (QT interval prolongation). Do not blindly trust that beef is safe in the U.S.
@jessicaferrisRD Due to my allergy to corn, I can attest to the fact that I cannot consume commercially-processed meat, poultry, seafood, fruit, or produce due to FDA-mandated corn-derived acid washes.  At least I'm consuming much less glyphosate than the majority of the population.
@jessicaferrisRD The FDA refused to answer my question regarding their mandated corn-derived acid washes, and whether these corn-derived acid washes are from GMO or non-GMO corn.  Other affected foods include commercially-processed meat, poultry, seafood &amp; fruit.
@jessicaferrisRD Non-organic vegetables are treated with FDA-mandated corn-derived acid washes; therefore, invest in organic-only vegetables to limit your child's exposure to glyphosate.  Wash thoroughly due to possible corn cross-contamination.  https://t.co/iv8kuuiiEx

@SGottliebFDA Since corn is ubiquitous and exempt from FDA labeling requirements, when someone dies from an anaphylactic reaction to corn, their death most likely falls under "unknown allergen."  Corn is just as lethal as an allergy to the Top 8!
@SGottliebFDA I have filed adverse reaction reports with my state FDA rep. (and the FTC) against manufacturers falsely advertising their products are "corn free." These manufacturers have NOT removed their corn-free claims.  What is the purpose of filing adverse reaction reports?
@SGottliebFDA We need an urgent mandate passed requiring that hospitals stock corn-free foods, fluids, and drugs for the safety of corn-allergic patients.
@SGottliebFDA When is the FDA going to take action to protect corn-allergic patients?  Our membership in online corn allergy support groups is more than double the membership in sesame allergy online support groups!
@SGottliebFDA The only corn-free product available in hospitals is straight saline-only IV fluid.  We are still required to provide our own corn-free products while hospitalized.  What would happen if our hospital admissions were due to an emergency?
@TJCommission The only corn-free product available in hospitals is straight saline-only IV fluid.  We are still required to provide our own corn-free products while hospitalized.  What would happen if our hospital admissions were due to an emergency?

@TimothyEdenRD Corn products/derivatives to avoid if you are allergic to corn	https://t.co/JYDG3opJ6P
@winder_gill @JTarboxMD Many physicians are unaware that dextrose is the sugar derived from corn; and, therefore, we must avoid dextrose IV fluid &amp; iodized salt (corn-derived dextrose).  It took me 3 years to forward the product information sheet for dextrose IV fluids to our nation's hospitals.
@winder_gill @JTarboxMD My own allergist could not determine my corn allergy from my symptoms. In fact, he didn't test me for corn initially.  It wasn't until 6 months later that I asked him to test me for a suspected corn allergy (2-year food journal).  Positive result.
@winder_gill @JTarboxMD Some symptoms of corn allergy from corn allergy group members (over 10K):  anaphylaxis, nausea, vomiting, hives, acne, migraines, cardiac arrhythmia, acute abdominal swelling/pain, bloody stools, mucus in stools, depression (sense of impending doom), etc.
@winder_gill @JTarboxMD Supporting history? I suffered for 3 1/2 yrs. (it felt like all of my food was poisoning me), and had a myriad of tests (2 of which put me in the hospital) before my gastroenterologist finally recommended I see an allergist.  My skin-prick test to corn was positive!
@faactnews Since acquiring an allergy to corn in 2011, I have not been able to eat at any restaurants.  Corn/corn derivatives are ubiquitous and EXEMPT from FDA labeling requirements.

@faactnews Many allergists, including board-certified allergists, are unaware of the complexities involved with navigating an allergy to corn.  We, the corn allergy population, have had to assume the role of respectful educators to the medical community.
@faactnews My board-certified allergist failed my questions to test his knowledge re:  corn allergies.	"Why did I suffer a severe allergic reaction to iodized salt, and dextrose IV fluid?"	ANSWER:  Both contain corn-derived dextrose.

Another question to test your allergist's knowledge.  "Why am I having a severe allergic reaction to iodized salt?"  If your doctor doesn't know, find a new allergist for your safety!!!  	Answer:  Iodized salt contains corn-derived dextrose.

@faactnews @vermontnutfree Sadly for the corn- and soy-allergic consumers, most of their products contain corn-derived and soy-derived ingredients .  GMO or non-GMO corn/soy?  A little glyphosate for Valentine's Day?
@AAFANational Until there is mandatory labeling of every ingredient (including from where the ingredients are sourced; e.g., corn-derived ascorbic acid), the life of every person suffering with an allergy is at stake.  This would prevent needless deaths due to anaphylaxis.

@NanciGuestRD @DrValerieTaylor Most corn-allergic patients require their medications to be compounded to exclude corn (used as a common filler).
@NanciGuestRD @DrValerieTaylor An allergy to corn can also cause depression ("corn rage").	"The Surprising Food That May Cause Anger &amp; Aggression," Jaclyn Harwell	https://t.co/BqdxQ4ntAf
@RichDuszak @HeartOTXHeartMD These systems prohibit corn-allergic patients from listing their allergies:  corn-derived dextrose, corn-derived citric acid, corn-derived ascorbic acid, corn-derived maltodextrin, etc.  Our lives are in constant danger due to these omissions!
@WebMD Unless you are allergic to corn (FDA-mandated corn-derived acid washes contaminate all commercially processed meat, poultry, seafood, fruit, and produce).  I wonder if all of these corn-derived acid washes are from GMO or non-GMO corn!
@faactnews @EleanorGarrow Schools must be informed that corn is ubiquitous and exempt from FDA labeling requirements -- a critical danger to corn-allergic students every day!  Each school must be provided with corn allergen lists of products/derivatives to avoid.	https://t.co/JYDG3opJ6P
@EleanorGarrow @Walmart @faactnews Please avoid giving your corn-allergic sweetheart any food products.  Corn is ubiquitous and exempt from FDA labeling requirements.  Corn-derived citric acid/ascorbic acid/dextrose/cornstarch/corn syrup, etc. can be LETHAL!  Stay safe!
@faactnews @Walmart Please avoid giving your corn-allergic sweetheart any food products.  Corn is ubiquitous and exempt from FDA labeling requirements.  Corn-derived citric acid/ascorbic acid/dextrose/cornstarch/corn syrup, etc. can be LETHAL!  Stay safe!
@true_rdn Oh, how I miss oatmeal. Quaker Oats advised us to avoid their products if allergic to corn due to corn cross-contamination issues in the many stages of shipping, handling, processing, and packaging. Could be the reason glyphosate is showing up in their products.
@AllergicLiving Too many medical professionals reference the "expert" opinions on the AAAAI and ACAAI websites without questioning the validity of their "expert" opinions; thus, endangering the lives of many!  Are they funded by the food industry?  Possible conflict of interest?

@BreadsFromAnna I just received 10 boxes of your yeast-free bread.  I had tried it once before with no allergic reaction.  Delicious!!!  In addition to yeast, I'm also allergic to corn, soy, dairy, some nuts, and rice.  I'm very happy that you had these in stock again. THANK YOU!

@MasriAhmadMD @US_FDA @SGottliebFDA I am one of those rare individuals allergic to 99% of antibiotics with the exception of FLQs.  They are my last resort, so I must risk the potential AD and/or AA.
@SGottliebFDA When will corn-allergic pts. gain access to critical corn-free drugs (used as a common filler)?  Many corn-allergic pts. must have their drugs compounded to exclude corn, and most insurance companies do not cover the cost of compounded drugs. Corn is even in blood transfusions!

@SGottliebFDA ALERT THE MEDIA;  If the FDA declares sesame an official allergen before declaring corn an official allergen, WE MUST EXPOSE THIS BLATANT DISCRIMINATION WITH NATIONAL MEDIA.  Statistics prove there are more people allergic to corn than to sesame (refer to my other tweets).
ALERT THE MEDIA;  If the FDA declares sesame an official allergen before declaring corn an official allergen, WE MUST EXPOSE THIS BLATANT DISCRIMINATION WITH THE NATIONAL MEDIA.  Statistics prove there are more people allergic to corn than to sesame (refer to my other tweets).
DEMAND TRANSPARENT LABELING (ALL INGREDIENTS, AND THE SOURCE OF ALL INGREDIENTS), SO THAT NO MORE LIVES ARE LOST TO ANAPHYLAXIS!  STOP SPECIAL-INTEREST FUNDING FOR THE SAFETY OF ALL OF US!
No one should needlessly die from unlabeled ingredients (including the SOURCE of those ingredients) in our foods.  The FDA should be advocating for the safety of CITIZENS; not special-interest groups!
I was recently REFUSED emergency hospital care due to my allergies (monitored ONLY).  Hospitals must be mandated to stock corn-free foods, fluids, &amp; drugs for the safety of corn-allergic patients.
On 3/15/17, the hospital (S. Florida) could NOT comply with the surgeon-ordered liquid-only diet, since ALL of the liquids contained corn-derived ingredients.  My allergy to corn was clearly stated on my medical records!
Hospitals can care for patients with any allergy EXCEPT FOR CORN ALLERGIES!  Therefore, an allergy to corn should be considered a life-threatening diagnosis!
The corn allergy population can consume very few processed foods and no commercially-processed meat, poultry, seafood, fruit, or produce due to FDA-mandated corn-derived acid washes.  Not even organic products are safe due to corn cross-contamination.
The government has removed safe sources of corn-free foods, liquids, and medications from the corn allergy population without first establishing safe corn-free sources of these basic human requirements (a daily struggle to survive).
Sesame will be declared an official allergen before corn?  As of 11/1/18, membership of corn allergy Facebook support groups = 10,257; sesame allergy Facebook support groups = 4,659.  Blatant discrimination against the corn allergy population!!!
We need mandatory labeling of corn-derived ingredients for the safety of corn-allergic consumers.  There are more than double the people allergic to corn than to sesame (proven from online support group membership).

@RyanNutrition We still do not have a law protecting corn-allergic patients in hospitals. Corn-allergic patients are required to provide their own previously-prepared corn-free products while hospitalized.  What would happen if our hospital admissions were due to an emergency?

@SGottliebFDA I have filed reports with my FL FDA representative re: mislabeled food products ("corn free" claims, however, the products clearly contain corn-derived ingredients leading to allergic reactions); yet the manufacturers have NOT revised their labels.  PLEASE ADVISE!
The corn allergy community must contact mfgs. to inquire if products contain corn-derived ingredients (exempt from FDA labeling requirements). Many mfgs. refuse to answer indicating that this information is "proprietary." They should be required to release this info, on request! https://t.co/pfwqSWQ3jv
@ACAAI Email from Andreia, Consumer Affairs, ACH Food Companies, Inc. Re: protein content in Argo cornstarch	". . . USDA nutrient database declares 0.26g per 100g."
@MayoClinic Depression Trigger = Corn Allergy.  Hospitals have not been mandated to stock corn-free foods, liquids, or drugs (compounded to exclude corn).  What if our admissions were due to an emergency?  They should post signs on their doors that corn-allergic patients are not welcome.
@SGottliebFDA @WSJopinion ATTENTION:  Hospitals do not offer compounded corn-free medications for the safety of corn-allergic patients.  PLEASE MANDATE THAT HOSPITALS MUST STOCK CORN-FREE FOODS, FLUIDS, AND DRUGS (or post signs on their doors that corn-allergic pts. are not welcome).
@SGottliebFDA @WSJopinion ATTENTION: Most corn-allergic pts. must have their medications compounded to exclude corn at great expense (most ins. companies do not cover compounded drugs).	BCPharmacists, "Warning: corn-related allergens . . ."	https://t.co/scwupRS7SG
@SGottliebFDA @WSJopinion ATTENTION:	Baxter Labs specifically warns about administering dextrose IV fluids to corn-allergic patients.	 "Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with known allergy to corn or corn products." - Page 3	https://t.co/E5WLlZU6dw
@FoodAllergyZone We need mandatory labeling of corn/corn-derived ingredients.  Hospitals cannot treat/nourish corn-allergic patients, since they do not understand the critical difference between dextrose and corn-derived dextrose, corn-derived citric acid, etc.
@SenBillNelson My Labor Day has been spent respectfully educating medical professionals re: corn allergies; e.g., corn-derived dextrose IV fluid must NOT be administered to corn-allergic patients per the warning on the product information sheet!

I was successful in finding corn-free eye drops &amp; gel that are safe for me, and would recommend GenTeel Tears (Preservative Free Formula) and GenTeel Tears Gel for anyone allergic to corn.  As always, still trial with caution in the event they change their formulation.
@Novartis Thank you very much for formulating eye drops &amp; gel that are free from corn/corn derivatives (my allergen).  I would highly recommend GenTeel Tears (Preservative Free Formula) &amp; GenTeel Tears Gel to anyone with an allergy to corn.

@NFarrellRDN @JBlankenshipRDN @RobWittman @timkaine @eatrightPRO @MaryRussellRDN @donnamartinrd I have contacted all 535 members of Congress 6 times in last 4 years on behalf of corn-allergic patients.  Hospitals are not mandated to stock corn-free foods, liquids, drugs; so we are required to supply our own corn-free products.  What if admissions were due to an emergency?

@FDArecalls Two months ago, I filed adverse reaction reports for 4 products that were mislabeled which led to an allergic reaction. The companies are still advertising their products as "corn free" when they do, in fact, contain corn.  Why should we bother filing adverse reaction reports?
