@SarahJKS77 @esouthersHVE According to DMV ‚Äî‚ÄîYes. You can get pulled over for driving with expired tags. On the bright side, driving with expired tags is usually a non-moving violation. If registration tags are not affixed to your license plate, you can get a ticket.
@SarahJKS77 @esouthersHVE I don't think she was angry. Not sure why you are interpreting this story in that way.
@SarahJKS77 @esouthersHVE Sarah, watch the video again. She was a block from home and she is not the one who posted the video online in hopes of gaining attention. The LEO did that all on his own. She is a victim, no disputing it.
@TheDemCoalition Abortion after birth: How exactly does that work?
@SarahJKS77 @esouthersHVE Additionally, perhaps she picked up an "unsafe" vibe from the LEO and declined a ride.
@SarahJKS77 @esouthersHVE *If you get pulled over twice with registration that is expired by more than six months, you could face stiff penalties as severe as going to jail. More commonly, however, you will be issued a criminal traffic citation and a notice to appear in court.
@SarahJKS77 @esouthersHVE And then there is the horrific, racist video, which can be fully laid at the LEO's feet.
@SarahJKS77 @esouthersHVE Ah, I understood her to have an expired registration.  Still, the officers put her in harm's way by leaving her with no other choice than to walk home. I understand she declined a ride with them, understandably so. Other arrangements should have been made.

Congrats Croatia. Now, beat those Russians!
@_austrian Thank you for taking such incredible care of our peanut allergic daughter after @FlySWISS dropped the ball and left her unable to reach Vienna for her grandfather's 88th Birthday Celebration. She arrived safely and with only good things to say about @_austrian
@NoNutTraveler Argh!!!
@NoNutTraveler Check-in at Austrian Airlines brought more surprises. SwissAir made no note of daughter‚Äôs peanut allergy in the booking they made to remedy the problem. #flyswiss
@FlySWISS She was rebooked on a flight departing today on Austrian Airlines. Austrian Airlines has no peanut policy and when we phoned, they could not confirm that peanuts would not be served on board today. How is this a fix to yesterday‚Äôs problem?
@FlySWISS and advised her that her request to make an announcement to nearby passengers about her peanut allergy could not be accommodated as SwissAir is a nut friendly airline, despite your website touting your ‚ÄúCertified Allergy Friendly‚Äù status.
@FlySWISS  informed onboard that peanuts would be served on board after she was assured at booking time and check in that she could fly with your airline. Flight attendant was extremely discourteous,

.@FlySWISS Daughter is back at JFK trying to get to Vienna with no assurance her efforts (train to plane, check-in, security) will result in a safe flight to meet her family to celebrate her grandfather's 88th birthday.
.@FlySWISS Daughter put me on the phone with gate agent, who said SwissAir is a "nut friendly" airline, he was very busy, and did not have time to speak with me about his young and now distressed customer.
.@FlySWISS SwissAir claims my daughter chose not to fly with them. What they failed to record in incident notes is that she decided this AFTER she was advised that peanuts were being served on board as she waited to reboard.
.@FlySWISS They rebooked daughter on Austrian Airlines, which has no policy regarding peanuts. When we called, they said they could not confirm whether today's flight would include the service of peanuts.
.@FlySWISS rebooked my daughter with peanut allergy on Austrian Airlines for a flight departing today. After letting her check-in and board plane with peanut allergy, only to inform her once onboard, it is a "nut friendly" airline.

I thank you, Luanne

And that you are a certified allergy friendly airline.
Why was she denied boarding ? Your policy says you do not serve peanuts .
