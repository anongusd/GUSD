@exfkaty I have been called to others. the name game.blum Blum boo bum bananafana and so on. tks
@exfkaty When we were kids my cousins .my uncle geo his boys. I would tell them when I grow up I want to be like grandpop.and when they grow we could combine the companies. I was 12 years old they 12 &amp; 13 Greg &amp; curt.we were dreamers. When he sold .he sold his name. GST. I have seen that
@exfkaty Is it a shame. This is why we have a bill 160682. Every day I write about statement 160682. All city council needs to do, enforce the penalties. Bill 160682 was put in place because of a few towing's going bad.  private property owners feel the effect, now they wait for a ticket
@exfkaty I don't support billy. He told me to stop sharing messages on FB site. so now I don't recommend him
@exfkaty my uncle passed
@exfkaty if you did a class action suit as you say, then you already know who the owners are.	 Not geo smth. We have always done it right. My grandfather taught us.
@exfkaty not lew Blum towing.not abobs towing not stevens towing not south Philly towing.I can go on and on you think all of us are bad.?
@exfkaty no geo smith is my uncle or was.
@exfkaty All L &amp; I had to do was issue fines suspension. I have been pleading with council .enforce the fines.if they would have suspended his license after the 3rd complaint. He never would do anything wrong again. I testified in rm 400 12 4 2016.asking council for suspensions. still
@exfkaty You and everyone else blame our industry. Over a few complaints, most of us 99.9% are doing it right. We have a few bad operators they need to be disciplined. Just like there are few terrible councilmembers, do we call all of them liars, cheaters. and thives.
@exfkaty my grandfather was Lew Smith he started in the late 1930s in 1967 my uncle geo started geo smth towing in 1978 lew Blum towing started. my uncle sold his business.about 15 years ago. johnny doc asked councilman Henon to make up complaints.sanchez wrote the bill 160682 https://t.co/0brsTz40kA
The Philadelphia parking authority, have been ripping off Philadelphia since the inception. They came from Harrisburg. The PPA is the cash cow for Harrisburg. Philadelphia should have their own towing body. At no cost to the city.private tow could give 60% for the contract. https://t.co/3FQ7iUik4c
@exfkaty you could have taken them to small claims court .and you would have won.
@exfkaty Define predatory tow companies. There are many types of towing .who are talking about?
@exfkaty I know what happened with geo smith.I asked them to give refunds.I  don't operate that way. I have a BBB a- rating. My company does it right, I am a traveler lodge 126 I I have asked city council. Penalize .suspend their tow licenses. Nothing form the city council. enforcement
@exfkaty you do not have tons .show LEW BLUM TOWING on those videos
@quityourlife explain yourself
@exfkaty Are you sure about that? In what way do towing companies ripoff citizens.? https://t.co/aApYeSyFrL
@exfkaty You're right .to bad for Philly. I have changed my mind .here are a few I will support 	Daniel Duke Orsino.Sheila Armstrong, Melissa Robbins, Joe Fox,, Beth Finn.

@DanielSauder1 @PaSenateDems @Senatorcosta I am a businessman, not a politician. I am not elected to my office. But those who seek public office/public servant are voted to serve. You are hired to help the people. Presidents, governors, and mayors can only serve 2 terms, how about unlimited TERMS for all. Like that!
@DanielSauder1 @PaSenateDems @Senatorcosta Wrong .what is good this goose. It is right for the other. City government put term limits on the private towing industry, passing bills like 160682. Blame them for the way we feel, maybe you can write them. They might listen to you. we need change, amend bill# 160682
@AsadDaDrummer This information could help many people.when you become a public servant, help as many as you can. Reach out and touch.
@DanielSauder1 @PaSenateDems @Senatorcosta Owner/operator for 40 years. Philadelphia city council passed a bill# 160682. This bill# has devastated the towing industry since feb.2017 our sector has asked for an amendment, Councilwoman Sanchez has labeled our industry, predators. My pleas have gone unanswered.term limits
@DanielSauder1 @PaSenateDems @Senatorcosta give someone else the opportunity, it's good to clean the house every 8 years.
@craasch @KAFosterSowell @argusjellis @dcexaminer whatever 2 terms only 2 terms are 2 terms
@DanielSauder1 @PaSenateDems @Senatorcosta Then why are presidents governors and mayors have given term limits? As you say they don't work.they do work. All who seek public office.2 term limits, one for all, all for one.  america we need term limit reform.2 terms serve.

@RepKinsey it should not be democratic or republican, we have a problem with transparency when it comes to citizens vs police,this could be paid for without using tax payers money.the properties that are confiscated.all proceeds should  go to the police departments who made the arrest.
@RepKinsey let city council know.with the money from the PPA,council can scrap the soda tax .by doing that would bring 75 million more from sales, hire 500 new police officers every year until we have a force 12'000 strong.get philly clean and safe.people will come they will invest in us.
