@mamakalli not crazy at all! You know when you go with other families, they get half off their admission, right?
@mamakalli Thanks for your feedback, and sorry for confusing the issue.
@mamakalli But with your membership, you don't pay admission anyway AND you get at one event a month all summer at Farm Country.
@mamakalli Dang it, now I've really messed you up. It was $3.50, but it's been years since we've changed prices and it was very necessary.
@mamakalli :-( We hadn't adjusted the price in several years. Do you have a membership? That's the best deal AND it's tax-deductible.
