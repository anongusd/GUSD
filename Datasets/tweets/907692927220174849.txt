@krassenstein @DearAuntCrabby yep .. and https://t.co/hY4Yzyualn says over 3600 stores will close this year .. see the chart
Check out the graph for 2018 store closings:       https://t.co/hY4Yzyualn 	more have been announced so this list is actually a bit "conservative"

@dancer_carole @ch47dplt @TrumpFixAmerica @az_movement @VP I agree, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development estimates that 39,471 veterans are homeless on any given night.  HUD also estimates Roughly 45% of all homeless veterans are African American or Hispanic,  despite only accounting for 10.4% and 3.4% of the U.S. veteran
@dancer_carole @ch47dplt @TrumpFixAmerica @az_movement @VP I agree that homelessness is a major issue so I don't want to spend money on a wall when AIR estimates "A staggering 2.5 million children are now homeless each year in America.  This historic high represents one in every 30 children in the United  States."

@JustMyOpinions4 @SenateGOP @dcexaminer I applaud the business who are doing both .. many are not.
@EthelRo39311274 @JustMyOpinions4 @SenateGOP @dcexaminer A $1K (one time) bonus works out to less than an added $20/wk for the year for the worker.  A $3/hr raise =s an added $120 per 40 hour week.  This translates to increased benefits based on wage, taxes collected by the feds/state and a win/win for all.  Raise #MinimumWage
I know you support #SaveCHIP @SenCapito  Lead the way to get this done for WV. https://t.co/VIhuJRjinT
@SenateGOP @MikeCrapo That is a good start .. now how about making tax breaks for the middle class #Permanent !   Also, you could raise the #MinimumWage  .

@SenateGOP @dcexaminer These #TrumpBonuses  are PR stunts.  Workers should be given raises in pay.  The difference is #raisesnotbonuses are permanent, taxes are taken over a year not in one pay and benefits are calculated on pay rates.  If #Republicans  are #ProWorker  raise the #MinimumWage

@stevelevine Congress should raise the #MinimumWage to assure that the tax breaks given to corporations do some good for workers.  The #Bonuses that are being given are just a cheap PR trick.  Bonuses:  are not permanent, taxes are taken out in a lump sum and a $1K bonus = &lt; $20 / wk.
@Sen_JoeManchin  While companies are giving bonuses this year and that is good, the reality is that it is cheaper for a company to give a one time bonus rather than a pay increase.  It isn't long term, the taxes are taken up front.  Please support an increase to the #MinimumWage
@marcorubio I will stand with the you, if you will stand with me against a @POTUS  whose tweets pose a threat of nuclear war, whose environmental polices will be disastrous to the U.S. and the world and whose focus is on a small percentage of insiders rather than the people who elected him.

@Sen_JoeManchin  sadly the #TaxScamBill has passed but if the Congress really wants to help workers there are a couple of things the #DemocratParty  should champion in 2018.  Raise the #minimumwage and require businesses to provide health care benefits to ALL workers.

@SenSchumer @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems Corporations have been taking away promised pensions and benefits for years.  That is why #TaxReform as it stands will not help workers.

You can't have it both ways.  Either the economy is booming which means more taxes to offset the deficit OR we need tax reform to stimulate a sluggish economy.  Let's call #TaxReform  what it really is .. a payoff for the corporate and mega-rich campaign contributors. https://t.co/3atEWQOZ5k

@SomeGuyInOKC @sacampbell1788 I think that the US minimum wage should at least allow workers to be at or slightly above the poverty level.  Small business should get tax breaks to offset the costs.  Corporations should have to pay a penalty tax for using the "part time" gimmick to avoid paying benefits.

@SenBobCasey I would like to thank these informed and forward-looking Democratic Senators for their efforts to save #NetNeutrality
@AARPadvocates @SenatorBaldwin Many caregivers are grandparents.  For me, one of my biggest worries today is that my Social Security and Medicare will be changed.  I don't know how I will be able to continue the same level of care with less money or security.
@SenCapito Please #ProtectMedicare  and #SocialSecurity  @SenCapito   The #OpioidEpidemic  has broken homes and many grandparents are now raising their grandchildren.  These benefits were paid for in advance and reducing them would be disastrous to these families.
@SenCapito If you want to boost the economy, @SenCapito  , you should consider a bill to #RaisetheMinimumWage.  That money will flow back into our economy and help the people of WV.  Now is not the time for corporate tax cuts.  #ProtectWorkingFamilies
@SenCapito Please don't vote for any bill that takes away or reduces Medicare / Social Security.  People worked and paid into the entitlement programs and if anything should be cut it should not be what we paid for in advance.  I also support #ExtendCHIP .
@jaketapper @CNNPolitics I paid for my social security and medicare for 35 years.  That is #NotEntitlement !
I paid in to social security for over 35 years while I worked and paid taxes.  Why would anyone in Congress in good conscience think Medicare should be reduced.  #ProtectMedicare  @SenCapito   @Sen_JoeManchin  @RepMcKinley https://t.co/RecUbzqj6p
@NBCNews You are so right!
@Reuters When you owe over 10 trillion, you don't intentionally bring in less money.  It is time to raise the minimum wage to encourage people to work.  Businesses that use the "part time" loophole to avoid paying workers benefits should be taxed so the government could provide insurance.
I paid into Social Security for over 35 yrs.  My retirement benefits are #NotEntitlements they are pre-paid insurance.  Congress should not take away what I have paid for during my working years. https://t.co/MxHzvUrREu
Amen .. raise the #minimumwage to help families not corporations. https://t.co/09Rszqpk0K
@SenCapito @SquawkCNBC If giving tax breaks to corporations works .. why did you, @SenCapito  and @Sen_JoeManchin have to get a bill passed to secure promised benefits for miners.  When you are in debt you don't want to take in less money.  Collect more taxes by raising the minimum wage.  #minimumwage

It's time to make any changes or sign-up for health coverage at https://t.co/Qz1IQOrlAe #GetCovered https://t.co/liFpyHDYks
@RepMcKinley Trickle down economics does not work.  If it did the Congress would not have to pass bills to get miner's the benefits, both pension and medical insurance, they were promised by companies who then took them away.
@SenJohnMcCain Thank you for making your position known @SenJohnMcCain  and for voting NO on this bill which is bad for U.S. citizens.  #bipartisanshipwins
Please vote NO @SenCapito  for the sake of WV. https://t.co/95Yh0SS01Z
Let's be clear.  #righttowork means you have a right to work WITHOUT union protections.  Remember unions protect #workersrights . https://t.co/4CIO0iOts8
@SenSherrodBrown Let's be clear.  #righttowork means you have a right to work WITHOUT union protections.  Remember unions protect #workersrights .
Corporations concentrate on shareholders and profits.  It is important that reviews and proper taxation of the mining corps. take place. https://t.co/4uTB5xLg3O

@SenCapito please stand up for WV and vote NO on the #GrahamCassidyBill  .
The #ACA , while not perfect helped me have insurance when my company failed to provide promised retirement coverage.  #MedicareForAll https://t.co/0ZwADF4YVK
@KamalaHarris With the need to repair U.S. #infrastructure due to the recent devastation in states from flood and fires, a wall is the last thing we need.
@NancyPelosi ¬°Eso es tan cierto!
Do not repeal the ACA with Graham-Cassidy. @Sen_JoeManchin , @SenCapito  @RepMcKinley  Our state needs a better solution than this one. https://t.co/838fSnFFXe
Any corporate #taxrelief should be tied to a higher #minimumwage and penalties for companies whose workers must use #publicassistance . https://t.co/yycFWVf65S
All industries should honor #pension commitments.  Sadly, many have let #retirees down by reducing both pensions &amp; #healthinsurancebenefits. https://t.co/T5Ohi4qfzd

Congress:  Please move on from "repeal &amp; replace" to REPAIR and IMPROVE our #infrastructure .  Jobs creation will be a side benefit.
@SenSanders This is the ONLY "repeal and replace" legislation that in good conscience I could ever support. #MedicareForAll
Discussing #infrastructure and job creation. https://t.co/VhBAkZ1SdV
The U.S. #infrastructure is in great need of funding.  Recent disasters have increased the need.  Budgeting for this should be a priority.
