So next time you hear that WHCD is a fundraiser for kids, remember that students are getting less &amp; less $ while the CEO gets more &amp; more
In the latest tax filing, the group's executive director's annual salary was bumped from $121,985 to $144,828. Nice work if you can get it.
And despite the great decrease in scholarship funding (down from $131,550 in 2013) group's Executive Director enjoyed 18 percent pay raise
Good to remember when we hear the WHCA boast about how central its scholarship program is to the dinner.
The WHCA's scholarship donations in their latest filing was $86,550. That's the lowest amount since 2007 (tied with 2014).
But their 2015 filing is now publicly available on Charity Navigator‚Äôs website.
Despite all their talk about ‚Äútransparency,‚Äù the WHCA doesn‚Äôt actually (or hasn‚Äôt lately) provide copies of their tax returns to reporters

WHCA has a good mission. It just does it very poorly. Them publicly acknowledging that would be a good start. Hopefully new ED will do that https://t.co/XVJcEVEoD9
And on a side note: salary has gone up while scholarship $ has gone down too. Another bad practice for non profit. https://t.co/XVJcEVEoD9
true but @charitynavigator chided the org for spending 50% of program services on ceo's salary. No nonprofit in good standing does that https://t.co/XVJcEVEoD9

‚Ä¶where were they for the past eight years?
Trump has been in office for two weeks. So while it‚Äôs cute that Vanity Fair/New Yorker, etc have suddenly gotten religion about press issues
All of that occurred for eight years. And, yet, during those same eight years, the WHCD grew in scope and popularity and size.
McClatchy‚Äôs Steve Thomma railed against the WH ‚Äúbanning photographers.‚Äù Obama prosecuted more whistleblowers than all prev prez combined
USA Today‚Äôs Susan Page called Obama the most ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù to press in history. NYT‚Äôs Baker said the administration ‚Äúdecreased transparency."
Quick point about all this ‚Äúboycotting‚Äù White House correspondents dinner/cancelling parties talk...

@doug_hanks I may be being generous. CSPAN doesn't release numbers. But CNN and others now carry it too
Same reason redistricting never happens: Pols agree with it in theory but don't want to tinker with the system while they're in power
...watch is totally unlikely. Which is too bad -- because it'd be a great demonstration of strength -- but also understandable.
So the notion that, after waiting over a decade for this once in a lifetime experience, a WHCA president would cancel the dinner on his/her
The whole year is understandably a very very big deal for reporters who typically hover in obscurity. They'll tell their grandkids about it
And most of all, you get a virtually one on one dinner with the president for *three* hours. That's unheard of.
You get to make a speech in front of millions of people on CSPAN, talk about your career, your colleagues, your family, what's impt to you
And it's an exciting year: You get lots of media attention. You get interviewed a lot. You get a lot of face time with celebrities.
WH correspondents wait decades for their turn to become the president of the WHCAssociation, a one year gig.
One other thought on why WHCD will never get cancelled (and, as sinister as this is, I don't have any one in mind when I say this)
RT @jackshafer: Did @pwgavin help destroy the WHCD?
@jackshafer don't tell my mom
it serves other purposes but the WHCA dinner's raison d'etre is to raise $. Accordingly I bet they'd triple donations if they cancelled it
I don't really have an opinion one way or the other but...
