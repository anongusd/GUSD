We just got a question in the inbox about our psychology efforts. I am so proud that JDRF is investing in training psychology professionals in diabetes care. Five institutions have been selected to host fellows for 2018-2019. Applications are due Dec. 14: https://t.co/15rUn8loDW
These victories help me approach life with #T1D peacefully. I don't beat myself up. #AskNicoleJDRF https://t.co/r5ngf1I8J0
I make a decision every day to think positively about my life and my diabetes. So I can celebrate, I set achievable goals for myself, like checking my blood sugar a certain number of times a day or making exercise a priority. #AskNicoleJDRF https://t.co/nlCnW0KNPU
Access to the devices we need shouldn't be a luxury. Join JDRF‚Äôs efforts and send your own #coverage2control letter to your insurance company on why affordability, choice, and coverage are so important for people with #T1D.

Diabetes is stressful for the entire family. It‚Äôs important for everybody to recognize the unique stressors that exist.

You are correct. A1c is not the only measure. A1c often doesn‚Äôt reflect the lived experience with #T1D. The number of highs and lows are a better representation of your quality of life. Track those things and share with your health team! #AskNicoleJDRF https://t.co/8EIlYRhV3H

#T1D is fatal without #insulin; you cannot just stop taking insulin, even if you can‚Äôt afford it. We NEED coverage: https://t.co/LNXSLnSjoJ https://t.co/ZxSqJXFleh
For insurers, quality, affordable coverage helps people with #T1D avoid costly emergency room visits, inpatient admissions, &amp; complications.
Recently, insulin costs have soared &amp; people with #T1D incur nearly 3x the medical expenses compared to people without #diabetes.

Use of 2-way texting may help teens with #T1D in their transition to self-care and transfer to adult providers. #2017ADA @JoslinDiabetes
it is encouraging that a 2-way SMS texting program can preserve A1c, preventing deterioration often seen in teens with #T1D. #2017ADA
Given the high penetration of mobile phones and the wide acceptance of text messaging among teens in general, #2017ADA
the PS intervention did not impact glycemic control (A1c). #2017ADA
Over 1 year, greater response to TM reminders to check BG levels was associated with better glycemic control and no deterioration in A1c
This often leads to suboptimal adherence/worsening A1c, which can hamper transfer to adult care &amp; promote early complications. #2017ADA
#T1D Teens often struggle with self-management as they simultaneously face the normal developmental challenges of adolescence. #2017ADA
