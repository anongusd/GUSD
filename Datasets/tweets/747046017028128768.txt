@SethMacFarlane Your latest #FamilyGuy ep was a discrete. Ur really trying to push the "immigration is not a problem" narrative. Have u even been @ the boarder &amp; seen how bad it is? &amp; look @ EU countries. Sweden, France, Germany &amp; UK r totally ruined. So stop spreading #FakeNews!
@lookner Goes to show how sick some people are. They really couldn't care less about the lion who was killed. And for what? Just so that they could retrieve a dead body? Yikes. There's a special place in hell for people like that.
@lookner These drone operators might be experience pilots when you look at their meringue techniques.
@lookner I know you can't steal their footage. But if France24 decides to broadcast it, their English channel is free to watch on youtube.
@lookner Why would they think he went back to his home? Very strange.
@lookner Now @BFMTV are now back to "At least 2 dead and 11 hurt in Strasbourg Christmas market shooting"
@lookner " #Strasbourg The search carried out this morning at the shooter's home was linked to an investigation around a robbery" - @BFMTV . So in other words, they might not even know if the shooter and the robber is the same person.
@lookner The gunman was wounded before he flee his home. Not during the fight tonight according to @BFMTV
@lookner Of the 13 victims, there are two dead and seven seriously injured and four minor injuries according to @BFMTV
@NickDiPaolo Actually you didn't solve it. Red Bar didn't start the 444 thing against you. Mike David wanted you to think it came from him, so he made up that story. 444 goes way deeper than you think. I can't tell you more, because I don't wanna be involved. I've already said too much.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, I hope this video reaches you	https://t.co/e87ItbvEje Please watch it @POTUS.
@lookner Yea that's understandable. Thanks for your great work, Steve.
@lookner Here's an idea if not too much hassle. Do you think you could start posting your sources and things people send you In the video description after the live stream? Should be easy enough to just paste all the links into a word document as you find or get the links. Thanks
@YG Ppl dont want politics in their music. Your music is great until u started with all that BLM, cop brutality stuff. Y do u keep doing that? Who r u at war with? Cuz in the real, thats not how it works. Most cops arent out to get u &amp; black unemployment rate is record low in USA
Lovely :) https://t.co/BaIgRXgSoh
RT @RyanAFournier: The left is completely unhinged. This is what it is like on a college campus in 2018 when you express your Conservativeâ€¦
@therealmikedean Hey man. How are you coming about finishing Yandhi? The hype is real!
@LilTunechi Happy Birthday, Wayne.	Loving your new album! :)
@Avramopoulos @DavorBozinovic If someone filmed this, please upload the video.
@lookner If you don't have the balls to mention this right after it happens, should we even care and should we feel bad for her? If you sit on this for 30+ years without saying a beep, then how are you even a victim? All these #MeToo cases seem to come out decades later.
@lookner Seeing as you keep covering X's death on your channel, I think you should watch this video. And watch the whole thing please;	https://t.co/hlpwvlicIa
@lookner Y do u disable comments on your vids? &amp; I have a theory as to y the media isn't covering the lava story as much. It doesn't fit their narrative. Lefties have to play the victim card, which isn't gonna work here cuz Hawaii is full of blue. So this is God saying B grateful
@nickjr Can you guys please air Little Bear more than just once per day? It is such a gentle program for little kids. So calm and peaceful. And the animation is nice too. My grandkids love Little Bear. I wish you'd air more cartoons similar to that, like Franklin the turtle.
Holy crap. Check this out @lookner @agendafreetv https://t.co/kcjvS06rMG
@lookner The more I hear about this shooting, the more I question whether or not it actually happened. Students are reporting seeing blood and bodies? Doesn't sound like a real situation. Because if I was there, I wouldn't be able to talk to anyone, let alone remember anything.
@lookner https://t.co/iZQCWbrCCZ
@lordjakewest @NBCNews @PeteWilliamsNBC Keep that left wing nonsense away from my tv
@lookner Not to interrupt this, but Breaking911 on twitter got suspended again. So twitter really isn't the best place for news outlets unless you are left wing.
@lookner Seems like he got suspended for doing his job. And 65 is hardly even "elderly". The officer is a victim of an overly sissified society. Poor guy. And liberals always use the "profanity" card whenever it's convenient for them. I am sorry, but I'm on the cop's side here.
@lookner Why did you quit RSBNNetwork?	Were they too right wing for you ? :)	God bless @realDonaldTrump. By far the best president we've had in a very long time!
@lookner This crash is rather scary. Seeing as the plane is completely smashed, we can only hope that they're able to recover the black boxes. Also, good luck on your new channel!
@DRUDGE_REPORT And this is newsworthy how exactly?	You're not @TMZ.
@lookner Please check out this video, Steve, regarding the wafflehouse shooting yesterday. This guy brings up a lot of good points. https://t.co/4CfhIx3wkk
@kthorjensen #TheCapitalistArmy is watching you. And #Ghost wants to have sex with you. He looked at your old website.
@QtumOfficial The core wallet download link for Linux is not working. Please fix.
@lookner I believe you're allowed to re-broadcast the live coverage that doesn't belong to you as long as you provide commentary, according to copyright law.
@lookner The rides are not up. They seemed to be back at first, but they shut off once they let people off. So must have been a temperately backup system or something.
@lookner The house is on fire!	Good on Trump.
@lookner BREAKING NEWS! Palestinian stabber gets shot:	https://t.co/VBgwPpyMhr
@Avramopoulos You are so hot and sexy, Dimitris
@MaltainEU @dr_micfarr @EUCouncil @Avramopoulos Looks like you're in #love 	@Avramopoulos sure is one sexy ass manðŸ˜€

@RSBNetwork Police now linking the #manchester explosion to terrorist attempt in Sweden a few hours ago: https://t.co/WMtaPur93I
@PoliticsGhost And this is part of the broadcast where Ghost brings up old and forgotten memes from an era before most of his listeners were born. Quaint!
@PoliticsGhost Not to be disrespectful or anything.	But could you please do a Saturday Night Troll Show today?

@PoliticsGhost He keeps telling himself that he likes it. So then why does it bother him so much?	He wrote 2 articles about how pathetic he is. #depression
@PoliticsGhost You should probably not do twitter shoutouts and graffiti if you hate humor and fun so much #SadOldMan #CryBaby #CupcakeMan.
@PoliticsGhost You should rename this "The Autism hour".
@PoliticsGhost Hey Ghost. How come you're such an outsider?

@PoliticsGhost Trump wants to isolate America.
@PoliticsGhost Trump wants rich people to pay less taxes Ghost.
@PoliticsGhost Stop calling people autists just because you want people to have a horrible life. People hate Trump for a reason, scumbag.
@PoliticsGhost But Trump doesn't want government to give out free money, Ghost. Did you forget about that?
@PoliticsGhost There are people who can't walk, talk, see and hear. What do you expect them to do with Trump's plan?
@PoliticsGhost You are forgetting about the disabled who can't work. Not everyone is gonna be able to work hard for their money Ghost
@PoliticsGhost What we did to him? He's an adult and should be able to take care of himself. I know he's a fucking retard, but stop babying him, #Ghost.
@PoliticsGhost The Furafinity profile is real https://t.co/QttJFL6M0S and you can't change profile name on that site. So it can't be fake.
@PoliticsGhost Why do you keep bullying people #ghost?	You are the one who should leave the internet.
@PoliticsGhost So now you are pro censorship like a lefty SJW faggot? #safespace #safespace4ghost #ghostisajew
@PoliticsGhost How did #Obama spy on #Trump?

@PoliticsGhost Please do 3 hours #Ghost	#MahKids I'll buy 15
@PoliticsGhost And besides from that, #Ghost. Most of his fans are not gonna be watching him on a 3rd party website.
@PoliticsGhost Everything is going to be okay, ghost.	Just take a nap.
@PoliticsGhost So wait! You set on the stocks and didn't close the trade before it went downhill?
@PoliticsGhost That really sucks. I was just about to dip into trading and follow your tweets. And I can't register on Gab. Gives me error.
@PoliticsGhost I made some Ghost art. Hope you enjoy and retweet it, ghost. https://t.co/ZWqjHdJz9G

Hey @PoliticsGhost! Look what your good friend Brony Network uploaded earlier https://t.co/eC5U400bIL via @YouTube
@Fighting_HIV gg, fam. Team Engineer keeps growing stronger. Let's make @PoliticsGhost cry some more.
@PoliticsGhost The Nutshack is some weird, racist cartoon show. They're comparing you to the show.
@PoliticsGhost Still boring! https://t.co/YA43k2KXSl
@PoliticsGhost Check it out, Ghost. We're sleeping in the chat, https://t.co/6G3WbPXOTX
@PoliticsGhost People in the brony chat doesn't get it. They say "poor prank victims" and "is ghost just dialling random numbers?".
@PoliticsGhost Best VPN I've found is IPVanish.	They hash your password. And they're not after your info by offering you a free version.
@PoliticsGhost @paltalk With voice chat?
@SuperMario7977 @PoliticsGhost A typo means that you mistyped. Forgetting the word "NOT" is not a typo.
@aaaasssshhhhh Not funny, dude. You shouldn't say stuff like that. @PoliticsGhost @GsLetter
@Izanagi314 Try to understand. @PoliticsGhost  is a man of moral values. A great philosopher once said "Jokes are for the weak".
@PoliticsGhost G is into hentai. He's been sharing hentai on BN King's Discord chat.
@PoliticsGhost It is true, Ghost. Sorry.

@PoliticsGhost You said you own pyramids. Where do you buy non-fake pyramids?
@PoliticsGhost So when the internet becomes censored, do you think that will also affect the deep web (.onion)?

@PoliticsGhost Can't wait to pee in your beer can. That'll be super sexy.
