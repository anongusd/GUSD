@SenRonJohnson #TrumpShutdown and its 10% pay cut for 1,200,000 contractors sure doesn't help. And in another week, you'll follow him in to another shutdown, and then wonder why it is hard to hire people.
@FIlevered @RepDMP The US has 20,000 miles of coastline.  Support the Coast Guard.
@kat_hassinger @GOP What little there was is now in the Democratic party.  Part of the reason for all the infighting. The Democrats now have the liberal, moderate, and conservative people. GOP is now just the name-calling racist radicals.

@RepRoKhanna If you did that, people wouldn't stay with abusive employers just to keep health insurance.		People with a business start up idea would go ahead and do so since they'd still have health coverage. 		Health care costs would drop 30-50% and be in line with the rest of the world.

@JohnCornyn 1,200,000 contractors unemployed in January due to #TrumpShutdown 		Not counted because politics. They're not paid, not getting back pay thanks to GOP senate rejecting the bill yesterday.		But you also want to hide the results of your actions.

@Reinlwapo @AltForestServ Pressure from senators Cardin, Van Hollen, Kaine, and Warner.  Administration had nothing to do with it.
@Netta_Mason @Reinlwapo @AltForestServ They don't.  OPM was pressed by the senators from VA and MD. Thank Cardin, Van Hollen, Kaine, and .... not the administration.
@JoyAnnReid Add to that the unsupported NWS forecasters trying to decide whether they should issue a severe weather warning. With #TrumpShutdown , they're overloaded and undersupported.  Winter is relatively easy. Wait for tornadoes in spring and hurricanes in summer.

@GrassleyPress Thought you were talking about Trump and #TrumpShutdown -- no interest on human rights, no rule of law, no interest in full time workers being able to feed themselves.  		Secretary Ross's inability to understand why employees need paychecks is the perfect crystallization.
@SenRubioPress Right. You in the Senate have nothing to do with legislation. Only the House and White House. Senate is purely spectators to #TrumpShutdown 		Why do you exist?
@RepCharlieCrist @NWS And now is the time of year hurricane preparations are made between NWS and emergency management groups. 		Thanks to #TrumpShutdown none of that is happening. Good luck FL and other hurricane-susceptible states. #TrumpShutdown means no prep and fatigued forecasters.

@SenatorCantwell @SenateCommerce You realize that Commerce is closed in #TrumpShutdown  you realize that many of the 400,000 furloughed people are in STEM? The value GOP puts on science is obvious: 0.
@rebroth @ScienceMarchDC @NASA @NASAGoddard Thanks to #TrumpShutdown there is nobody to read the applications. If it doesn't end by summer, no internships. If govt opens temporarily on a short term CR, it closes again on next round of #TrumpShutdown and the students can join feds in not being paid.
@donnazoll @Bklyncwgrl @RepKatieHill Unmanned walls are worthless. CBP says 	 Maybe you don't have to pay your bills, but the Coast Guard does. They can only take so long not getting paid in the #TrumpShutdown Then, they, and rest of DHS will have to quit. Why do you hate them and the Americans they protect?
@donnazoll @Bklyncwgrl @RepKatieHill Only 7% support #TrumpShutdown to get the wall. More support wall building. https://t.co/dAlGBUs1pG		Wall is useless without CBP, ICE, Coast Guard, and the others not being paid. If you don't need to pay them, you dont need the wall.
@donnazoll @Bklyncwgrl @RepKatieHill 93% of Americans dont think the wall is worth the #TrumpShutdown
@RepBeatty 30% of the federal workers not being paid in #TrumpShutdown are veterans. What are you doing for them? Anything as useful as passing a clean CR to restore their pay?
@SenCapito No, they're asking why the Senate won't consider the same bill they passed unanimously before the #TrumpTantrum Also why that bill contained none of the $5.7 billion that didn't become a crisis need until Dec 21, 2018. #TrumpShutdown
@SenCapito GOP has run against federal workers for decades. Cabinet Secretary Ross was just saying he couldn't see why any of the 800,000 are having trouble with not being paid, and it wouldn't be a bad thing if they never did get paid. #TrumpShutdown

@altNOAA #TrumpShutdown is because Trump doesn't care what happens to the country. Poor people already threatened with losing housing (HUD) food (snap) medicine. What's a few tens of millions unprepared for hurricanes?

@MarioDB Talk to #WheresMitch about his refusal to even bring house bills to a vote. #TrumpShutdown lasts until he does.
@bart3rio @SarcasticRover Newton Gingrich, 1995-6 invented this toxic form of shutdown. Ted Cruz re-applied it in 2013. Now #TrumpShutdown after he reneged on a unanimous bill from Senate. 		It has always been possible. But cultural norms prevented it from happening. One was to not hate civil servants
@RepDonBeyer Have you gotten https://t.co/aBuEkK06Zp approval? Most varieties of support are illegal for feds to accept. One meal or bag of groceries valued under $25 is about the limit (per independent source).
@RepTomReed You do not stand with the people affected by #TrumpShutdown  		In 33 days this is the first time you've mentioned us. To you, we are just props handy to wheel out now to use to attack Pelosi. She understands we shouldn't be props.
@SenKevinCramer @SpeakerPelosi Nobody who supports Trump, Mr Two Scoops, can complain about any body else being petty. #TrumpShutdown is because Mr Two Scoops reneged on his pre-shutdown agreement that passed Senate unanimously after Fox talking heads called him names.
@RodneyDavis Trump leaves the table. Democrats have been there. #WheresMitch is in hiding. #TrumpShutdown lasts until both come to table and both honor their agreement.
@RepRickCrawford @LeaderHoyer Probably has something to do with the fact Hoyer is in the House, which has passed 10 bills to end #TrumpShutdown  rather than the Senate, where #WheresMitch refuses to allow the bills to come to a vote.
@SenToddYoung @CoachLouHoltz88 They came to the table. Before #TrumpShutdown Trump said he would own it. After #TrumpShutdown started, he literally walked away from the table.
@AFGENational @ScienceMarchDC Too bad federal employees dont have a union. If they did, a walkout for nonpayment in #TrumpShutdown would have been organized weeks ago.
@c_m_dangelo @SierraClub @NSF For the GOP hampering science is a feature, not bug, of the #TrumpShutdown NSF, NASA, NOAA, NIST, USGS, ... all down.
@JeffHJR87 @PattyMurray Normally working people get these things called "paychecks". They use these "paychecks" to pay for food, car, housing, credit cards. 		#TrumpShutdown means no paycheck
@RepBonnie Pass legislation so that feds dont get prosecuted for accepting such assistance.  https://t.co/L8ALjmVlKc says illegal.
@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump When you're not paying the border patrol, there's no crisis at the border. #TrumpShutdown has nothing to do with security.
@RepMarthaRoby It'd be good to pay those NWS forecasters who are working heavy shifts without support or pay thanks to #TrumpShutdown
@RepLowenthal Be sure to include that employers have to pay the employees. #TrumpShutdown is proving that it makes little difference what the salary is when employer requires work but doesn't pay.
@RepWexton That's how we all cam see the wall isn't for security. If they don't need to pay FBI, DHS, etc, they dont need a wall. #TrumpShutdown is about harming Americans.
@GOPLeader @SteveScalise He reneged on the other three, including the one that the Senate passed unanimously the week the shutdown started. #TrumpShutdown is because he reneges on compromises.

@ThaDinDC @AOC But it is. People dying from rationing insulin, for instance.
@TigheLikeTie @SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump There were some major conferences in my field during #TrumpShutdown If anything, there will be more mail than usual. Plus a raft of meetings to try to figure out how to recover from the damage. Many irons were in the fire. Some have melted.
@SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump It'll be nice to get the missing paychecks. But in two weeks we all know the #TrumpShutdown resumes. The only thing we'll get accomplished in the interim is catching up on 5 weeks of emails and updating our autoresponders.
@CurtisUT No, it makes further rounds of #TrumpShutdown even more likely as blind hacking at the budget is what the GOP wants in the first place.
@LeaderHoyer @senatemajldr End the #TrumpShutdown with a real budget. Not yet another few weeks of temporary CR with yet another shutdown to follow.
@RepDelBene You realize that OPM is telling feds that it is illegal for them to accept such fed-targeted charity? #TrumpShutdown is not paying people _and_ severely limiting even charity they can accept. They'd rather feds starve.
@SteveKingIA How pathetic. Your defense against you being a white supremacist is that some white guy says you've helped him. Duh.
@JohnCornyn Pass again the compromise bill the Senate unanimously passed in December. End #TrumpShutdown 		Wall without people is worthless.  People with the current hundreds of miles of barriers are useful.		If you're not willing to pay the people, you dont need the wall.
@Tgpalmer64 @KK_Goodwin @Jhogan552 @RepGosar Wall + no people is worthless. People with current wall (already hundreds of miles of barriers) does good. End #TrumpShutdown if you care about security.
@RepGosar If security mattered, you'd end #TrumpShutdown and pay DHS among others. If you dont need to pay DHS you don't need a wall either.

@SenatorWicker Senate Democrats haven't blocked a thing. The last bill McConnell allowed for a vote, they passed unanimously. #TrumpShutdown is because Trump reneged as usual. Now that house is passing legislation, McConnell won't let Senate D or R, vote yes or nay.
@RogerPielkeJr @voxdotcom @drvox Paranoid much? I see you both just fine.
@RonWyden @stevenmnuchin1 It is an honest signal: you people don't matter. #TrumpShutdown has this as a central message to all people going unpaid, all who can't expand their business because needed information is unavailable,  and so on.

@TessDeco @SenBobCasey @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr McConnell won't let the bills from the house come to a vote in the Senate.  #TrumpShutdown lasts until he lets Senate vote to end it.
@SenWhitehouse @SenatorIsakson #TrumpShutdown means many science mentors are not allowed to mentor. Sends strong message to students that they should go to different field.
@RepDonBacon Our tech edge is vanishing as the #TrumpShutdown furloughs many of our scientists. As the #TrumpShutdown proves to students that science is not a good career. And that civil service is loathed by the GOP.
@RepDavidRouzer @POTUS Stunt is walking away from the table, which Trump did. #TrumpShutdown

@RepBillFlores The first amendment is a mutual non-aggression pact, not a tolerant statement. My practice of religion is only safe as long as you don't legislate against it, and vice versa. The 30 years war shows why this was so important.
@katyjb88 @Glen00915249 @Pexchysweet It's also fictional that everyone lives on 50% or less of their income. If they did, the economy would collapse. It's just an excuse by people who have no human empathy. #TrumpShutdown hurts real people, in and out of government.
@ChuckGrassley You're not paying those USDA workers. Not paying employees is what #TrumpShutdown is all about.

@mike68134553 @freedom_moates Trump signed the bill?

@DemonicVeggies @realDonaldTrump And should just starve since they're not being paid?
@Glen00915249 @justinamash So your solution is to starve them until most are dead?
@sportycm @mikebwonder @mrsneedly97 @TFulk01 So federal employees should just starve until you get what you want?
@obbrainerd They're too dedicated to let people die. The ones working without pay are in jobs where that is a real consideration.
@MAGAALLTHEWAY And should just starve the rest of this month?
@mike68134553 @freedom_moates So they should starve instead of get paid for working for the country?
@MAGAxMal The feds should just starve to death instead?
@SenatorTimScott A party platform that wins the endorsement of the KKK and neoNazis could also be a clue. Running KKK and neoNazis in the general election is another.
@RepBrianBabin They're passing bills that the GOP Senate already passed. It only the tantrum in chief keeping #TrumpShutdown going. He's also walked away from the negotiating table. Nothing for Democrats to negotiate with.
@RepDavidRouzer You mean the table that Trump walked away from. #TrumpShutdown will last until he negotiates in food faith. Or the GOP quits putting party above country.
@JohnCornyn It is Trump who walked away. Bring him back to end #TrumpShutdown

@RepTedBudd @washingtonpost Zero paychecks for 800000+ feds and contractors in #TrumpShutdown
@woodlin32 @JoyceWhiteVance What unions? Feds only have organizations that can put and say 'that's not nice', not unions.
@SenTedCruz @RepRooney Lead by example  -- resign.
@GOP @marc_lotter @VP Unless you're a federal employee or contractor,  in which case your paycheck is frozen. And 800,000 don't even get that in #TrumpShutdown
@JULZ44JULZ @danobrien1972 @RepDebDingell Tell Trump. It is his tantrum after Senate passed a bill unanimously that caused #TrumpShutdown
@RepDonBacon Tell that to Trump, who says his way or highway on the wall. #TrumpShutdown until you and he quit demanding your way or the highway.
@RepThomasMassie Shame on them for trying to keep people alive. Thanks to #TrumpShutdown there'll be less of that.
@GOP @SteveScalise The principle you believe in is not paying working people.
@GlennKluthe @AP He hates Democrats as much as you. That is why he won't bring to a vote the bill he already passed unanimously in the Senate. This time it was passed by a Democratic majority in the house. #TrumpShutdown will last.
@JimNf6 @ActualEPAFacts Is is really a strike if you're not being paid? #TrumpShutdown has 400,000 working without pay. In a normal walk out, the employer quits paying after the walkout. What does Trump do next? Not pay them _and_ call them names? (Already does, too late)
@ActualEPAFacts #TrumpShutdown is a lockout, not a strike. With some side dish of slavery as some are required without pay.
@thegoodfello @JoyAnnReid I doubt that. #TrumpShutdown is about Trump. He thinks the people working without pay don't need money to pay their bills. Safety net is having a wall.
@AP Since Trump won't honor an agreement White House people negotiate, why should Congress talk to anyone other than Trump? #TrumpShutdown is because he reneged on a deal McConnell and VP Pence had reached.
@gumavirg @nytimes It is illegal for them to work in #TrumpShutdown
@ChuckGrassley The Right is pretty hostile about a college student dancing. Fully clothed, in good clean fun. They're not the ones to protect the arts. Now that the dancer is in Congress, maybe the arts will get some protection.
@RyanMaue But they're also furloughed in #TrumpShutdown so cross your fingers that the automated systems don't have a hiccup.
@craicpype @CNN Civil servants don't have civil rights. #TrumpShutdown is just bringing this out.
@washingtonpost Putting it behind a paywall isn't helpful to people who aren't getting paid in #TrumpShutdown
@RyanMaue No implementation during #TrumpShutdown , so no FV3.		Most scientists are furloughed, so no work on improvements at NASA, NOAA, USGS, nor funded by them or NSF during #TrumpShutdown 		Non-critical data is also on furlough,  so even fewer people can work on improvements.
@danobrien1972 @RepDebDingell Try using your words. You have a point?
@danobrien1972 @RepDebDingell 400,000 are 'essential', and are working without pay through #TrumpShutdown The other 400,000 are 'nonessential' -- most science agencies, which provide science and data to US citizens and businesses-- NASA, NOAA, US Geological survey,  National science Foundation.
@lissasno1fan @AP Could be. So you want no more science or data from NASA, NOAA, US Geological survey, National Science Foundation, or other science agencies and staff furloughed by #TrumpShutdown ?		Many businesses rely on those data btw
@RepByrne So you voted against the trillion $ debt to give more money to the rich last year? And voting against wasting $5 billion on a useless wall, and to end the #TrumpShutdown
@RepMarkMeadows The 400 000 looking for work are furloughed from the govt. Only GOP would call #TrumpShutdown good job news.
@RepJoeWilson 400,000 jobs lost from #TrumpShutdown  400,000 more not being paid
@RepRobinKelly @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump When twit tantrums, GOP listens. 		Not as inspiring as EF Hutton's line, but that's where we are with #TrumpShutdown
@RepHuizenga @AP 800,000 feds not being paid, hundreds of thousands of contractors not being paid, businesses that support them losing business. All thanks to #TrumpShutdown
@Creole071666 @GOPLeader They also don't include the 800,000 not being paid during #TrumpShutdown nor the contractors, nor the jobs lost because they're all slowing their spending. #trumprecession anyone?
@RepMarthaRoby Can't.  #TrumpShutdown put over 400,000 out of work, with another 4000,000 not being paid.
@RepRickAllen But then #TrumpShutdown furloughed over 400,000 so the net is negative.  Another more than 400,000 aren't being paid.

@Veil928 @realDonaldTrump Co
@ActualEPAFacts No problem. They're furloughed and can't read their work email until #TrumpShutdown is over. You'll be settled in to new job long before the shutdown ends.
@NavajoGhost @repbenraylujan None of those have 30 foot high moronic fixed walls.
@BohsandOs @washingtonpost It is the bill Senate Dems and Reps supported unanimously. #TrumpShutdown reneged on his agreement when Fox told him to. The House GOP then wrote an R-only bill, which didn't pass Senate. Trump won't sign this one even if Senate passes. Just reminder he's a liar.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Billions of dollars in rotting soybeans, GM and Harley Davidson closing US plants. GOP has a strange notion of winning.  #TrumpShutdown
@maxwellidae @nytimes The pay freeze also applies to ICE and CBP #TrumpShutdown
@RepKayGranger Passing a bill that passed unanimously, bipartisanly, in the senate, that Trump had previously agreed to, seems pretty good faith. That Trump doesn't honor his word for even a few hours is why #TrumpShutown
@tozo @keithellison No. But what freeze are you talking about if not his freezing civil service salaries if he ever does pay them again.
@Sebasti20254686 @CNN Just like everyone else who has worked for him in the past 45 years. #TrumpShutdown
@tozo @keithellison Trump has never believed in paying his employees or contractors. He's still planning on not paying the people who work during the #TrumpShutdown -- thinks he can use that money for his wall.
@repmarkpocan But 800,000 civil servants won't see even a paycheck thanks to #TrumpShutdown and none of the millions of civil servants will see the less than cost of living raise congress agreed to but Trump is rejecting.
@anonbene5 @WhipHoyer They already offered $25 billion in exchange for some Dem priorities (DACA). Trump and GOP refused it. Before #TrumpShutdown Trump had agreed to a compromise with the Senate. It passed unanimously, then Trump reneged on his agreement.
@rep_stevewomack The blessing of a regular paycheck -- that you are denying to over 800,000 civil servants and contractors in #TrumpShutdown
@GOP @realDonaldTrump You have forgotten about the federal employees and contractors you're not paying or are making work without pay in #TrumpShutdown
@PeteOlson The opportunity for civil servants and contractors to paint and do plumbing for their creditors since #TrumpShutdown
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Right, that's why his advice to the civil servants he's not paying is to start doing vocational work for their landlords and creditors.  #TrumpShutdown
@golfman60 @RyanMaue So you would just fire the people furloughed, and continue not paying the people who are working without pay. 		How long do you want them to work without getting paid? #TrumpShutdown doesn't end until Trump honors an agreement.
@golfman60 @RyanMaue NOAA is in Department of Commerce, along with Census and others. You'd know that if you read your own links. #TrumpShutdown
@golfman60 @RyanMaue Work your way through the constitution. Learn what the words and sentences mean. This is very basic stuff.
@RyanMaue The people needed to do that are furloughed #TrumpShutdown
@golfman60 @RyanMaue All furloughed workers by present law will not be paid for the time of the #TrumpShutdown 		The emergency personnel won't be paid until after the #TrumpShutdown ends. The administration's official advice is to do chores for landlords and mortgage banks until then.
@golfman60 @RyanMaue The constitution demands a decennial census. #TrumpShutown doesn't change that
@golfman60 @RyanMaue They're keeping up their own pages even in #TrumpShutdown other parts of NOAA are off.
@golfman60 @RyanMaue Most of NOAA is locked out due to #TrumpShutdown The remaining ones working -- without pay -- are NWS forecasters. They're doing that, not web maintenance for other parts of NOAA.
@RyanMaue Systems still need maintenance, and that can't be provided. Some need regular updates, and the updaters are locked out #TrumpShutdown 		Everything that remains up is a tribute to the dedication and skill of the much-reviled NOAA employees.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Secured $1.6 billion and spent almost none of it. #TrumpShutdown  isn't to build the wall. He doesn't do that even with money.
@SecretaryAcosta @RepBillFlores @POTUS Over 800,000 people not being paid because of #TrumpShutdown makes that number more like 5%
@JerryMoran @NASA NASA is closed indefinitely thanks to #TrumpShutdown Hard to inspire STEM students when you can't go in to work. 		STEM doesn't look like good career option when the government furloughs almost all its scientists.

@glassmeg @BBCNews No, Mueller's investigation has independent funds and continues regardless. The White House may not know this. But there's a lot they don't know. Like it's illegal for the President to unilaterally let a contract for building 115 miles of wall. #TrumpShutdown

@brianknewhouse @RepRobinKelly Congress wrote the law that required the park service to close sites against all people in event of shutdown.  Not Obama's idea.

@DrieuAlexa @KamalaHarris Trump doesn't support the homeless, or veterans, or health care/jobs/housing for veterans, or food or housing for children, or medicine for the elderly as he reneged on his campaign promise to negotiate lower medicine prices. If you support Trump, you support none of those things
@DrieuAlexa @KamalaHarris You're not supporting our own.  You're cowering in terror and refusing to pay 800,000 Americans working for Americans, and some millions of contractors. Merry Christmas from Trump indeed!
@DrieuAlexa @KamalaHarris Government employees and contractors _are_ Americans.
@KamalaHarris Government employees and government contractors both. Neither is a concern of the GOP.

@mkra_shikari @washingtonpost Bombs and mass shootings are not equal to walking around saying you don't like something.  		The entire GOP is complicit in Trump's praise of killers and assaulters (Gianforte, _after_ a journalist was dismembered) until they vote against him and his hate monger if.
@FoxNews @PressSec Not LGBT Americans, nor blacks, nor Democrats, nor journalists, nor Jews, nor .... Them, he labels 'enemies of the people' and praises GOP members for assaulting. (Gianforte)
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Says the guy who couldn't be respectful enough to stop inventing antisemitic conspiracies around a holocaust survivor.
@mkra_shikari @washingtonpost The GOP side favors bombing Democrats and shooting Jews. I'm not going to cooperate with that. Trump continues to spout anti-Semitic conspiracy theories even after the synagogue murders.
@washingtonpost Would you people learn to tell the truth. It us not 'to the right ', it is 'in to fascism'. Trump doesn't 'make errors if fact', he lies. If you quit turning off the light, maybe Democracy wouldn't be dying in the darkness.
@dscott019 @salenamf @FoxNews @clairecmc Nice of you to admit that the GOP is for sale and wants wealth to count more than laws. You're welcome to your serfdom. Just take it somewhere else with you. I prefer the US constitution, and nobody, not even the rich, being above the law.
@FoxNews @POTUS For once he's right. They're looking for a country that respects its own laws. Trump has taken that away from them and us.
@DeanHeller @LindseyGrahamSC Now that you're back from your lovely vacation, how about addressing the multiple hate mongered murders committed following your party leader's hate list. The 11 murdered at a synagogue didn't have a nice vacation.
@dscott019 @salenamf @FoxNews @clairecmc Handy that having a billion $ automatically makes your immigration 'legal'. By the rules that apply to others, Murdoch would have needed a decade, not a few months, for citizenship.
@replouiegohmert The 11 dead at a Jewish synagogue and their families are Americans. Your support for their murderer is disgusting.
@marcorubio So you're saying the media should quit covering Trump. Even after 11 people are murdered in a synagogue, he's casting conspiracy theories at a holocaust survivor.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Too bad seconds later he went back to blaming Democrats and media, repeating his hate list #MAGABomber used. Adding to lock up George Soros after the synagogue shooting.
@Jacquelinecs12 @nytimes Fox finally stopped hiding the stickers.  Trump, however, is still blaming the media, still calling them 'enemy of the people', still praises GOPer Gianforte for assaulting a reporter. GOP studiously silent about their violence.
@Jacquelinecs12 @nytimes It's not on the GOP propaganda network, Fox. They're hiding the stickers and the fact that he's a Republican. It's on the media that Trump calls 'enemy of the people', 'lying media', the media that the #magabomber sent bombs to. He followed Trump's list. That's different.
@Jacquelinecs12 @nytimes Not all came out against violence. The President was just praising a GOP representative who attacked a reporter, and a country that brutally killed one. The GOP provided the enemies list the #MAGABomber used.
@Jacquelinecs12 @nytimes The knee jerk 'false flag' chant is strictly GOP. Your Party network won't even show the van covered in right wing.
@PceThruStrength @GOP @realDonaldTrump Only the GOP call it the Democrat Party. It is the Democratic Party. #MAGABomber is a registered republican, sending bombs to the GOP's hate list.
@chbrkr @tribelaw @CJsRebellion A Trump-appointed judge won't see any problem. There are reasons the votes are being switched.
@Jacquelinecs12 @nytimes Right off the bat, they said it was a Democrat.  Only after it came out #MAGABomber is GOP did they say the violence was bad.

@shashanj60 @MangiaMyLove @WhiteHouse @VP @realDonaldTrump Far _less_ than people doing the same work outside government. That's part of what locality pay, also cut by Trump, was to address.
@SenAlexander @POTUS Oh, so _that's_ why he cancelled the congresionally-approved pay scale for civil servants.
@Jossfjh @ChrisMurphyCT Civil servants do not have a union and it is illegal for them to strike. Any such move will only (again)  result in all strikers being fired and being replaced (if at all) by less qualified people. Precedent: PATCO and Reagan.
@PoeticJ59274248 @ChrisMurphyCT @Cassyork He's always been bad about paying employees and his contractors. No surprise that he's moving to do the same to civil servants.
@Statues2Go @l_buchas @trulybclark @ChrisMurphyCT No, then we elected Reagan. Up to that point our ratio was merely on the high end of what wealthy countries did. Ratio ballooned under Reagan and the first Bush, and more or less stable Clinton to start of Trump.

@SenAngusKing Thank you for your remarks at the Arctic Symposium! For those of us who cannot do graphics, what is advice you have for talking to Senators?
@RepMcGovern Aren't about 35% of Americans in GOP?
@reppittenger The irony that your plea is sandwiched in my feed between @JohnCornyn and @GOP making vitriolic condemnation of all Democrats.
@cityofwabash Did you know that in Peru the country, there is a city called Indiana?  It's on the Amazon, rather different climate :-)

@CoachforPOTUS @ChrisVanHollen An actual citation please. DMI publishes thousands of pages pers year. None of the ones I've read from them support your claims.
@JohnCornyn Valerie Plame
@CoachforPOTUS @ChrisVanHollen Sources please. Last three years were each new record warm. Hard to be a flat trend with three records at end.
@RepTomReed How about the full text of the bill. We can make our own summaries.
@KenCalvert Why not just post a link to full text of bill you voted for?  That applies in all 50 states, not just one.
