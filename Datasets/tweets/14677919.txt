It had been stolen in North Carolina and transported to Maryland.
The team manually combed through more than 14,000 gun records to track down the stolen gun that was eventually used to commit the murder of Harry Davis, Jr.
With support from @TeamTrace and @NewYorker, the investigative team dug through hundreds of arrest logs, warrants, and police reports, following a trail of stolen guns transported across state lines.
Federal provisions called the Tiahrt Amendments, which are backed by the N.R.A. and restrict public access to detailed gun-related crime data, posed serious barriers to this investigation.
Each year, tens of thousands of guns are stolen, and many end up on the black market. The reporter @BrianFreskos spent two years tracking stolen firearms to their eventual crime scenes. (THREAD)
