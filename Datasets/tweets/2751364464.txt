#MIchaelCohen  Rep Foxx asks if Mr Cohen will commit to not making money off of a book or movie deal. Cohen says he has spoken to people about a possible book deal. He will not commit to not pursuing a book deal. He will not commit that he will not pursue providing commentary.
#MichaelCohen The smoking gun is Cohen's testimony that Trump knew in advance about the DNC hack and Wikileaks about to dump Clinton e-mails. Cohen places Don Jr as the go-between following DJTrump's directions.
#MichaelCohen The documents substantiate the time line showing that the hush money was paid during the General Election. The check was written by DJT while in the White House.
#MichaelCohen The documents he has produced are DJTs financial statements provided to Deutsch bank which inflated DJTs income/assets, check from DJT's personal account reimburing Cohen for hush money payments to Stormy Daniels.
#MichaelCohen says that DJT made it clear that he wanted Cohen to lie. He did not directly say "LIe about this". Instead he would say: "Do it. Make it happen. How is it progressing?"
#MichaelCohen  has not entered into a cooperative agreement to reduce his sentence. He is already facing 3 yr prison sentence so has not incentive to lie today. Cohen says he has not asked for nor will accept a pardon from Trump.
#MichaelCohen Rep Mark Meadows is showing himself to be a DJT lapdog. I wonder if when it is all played out,, he will continue thinking it is worth it!
#MichaelCohen  is careful and precise in his answers. He acknowledges his guilt and shame and warns those trying to protect Donald Trump that they should be wary because continuing to protect Trump will land them where he is today. Cohen has provided documents for credibility.
#MichaelCohen "I used to defend Donald Trump just as you are, and if you continue doing it you will sit where I am."
#MichaelCohen "Everybody's job at the Trump organization is to protect Mr. Trump all the time every day. That is what happens in the Trump organization and that is what is happening here today in Government."
#MichaelCohen "I am concerned for my family. He said early in the campaign and joked 'I can shoot somebody on 5th Ave and get away with it, he is not joking." "When he goes on twitter and brings on my in-laws, my children, my wife, he knows what he is doing."
#MichaelCohen "I went to work for Mr. Trump not because I had to -- I went to work for him because I wanted to. I am the picture of what you should not do."
#MichaelCohen  "I am responsible for your silliness because I protected Mr. Trump for ten years. Your pulling out an article puts you into the same category as I am in -- in protecting Mr. Trump."
#MichaelCohen  I wonder how we can listen to these GOP apologists who are intend on obstructing from the American people learning the truth. What is apparent is Rep Gosar is a windbag who does not value the USA.
#MichaelCohen Attorney Client privilege should not trump (no pun intended) National Security.
#MichaelCohen Rep. Rice: "I don't think my colleagues on the other (GOP) side are afraid so much about you not telling the truth as much as they are afraid of what you say which is the truth."
#MichaelCohen "I spent the last week searching boxes to find the documents so that you do not have to believe me."
#MichaelCohen "Mr Trump would ask me about the progress of the Moscow project when we were walking to the car, or during  a meeting" (during the campaign) "I would report back to him. This would be the largest building in all of Europe."
#MichaelCohen  Rep Lynch questions Cohen about talking to DJT about the progress of Trump Tower Moscow. Cohen says he briefed Don Jr and Ivanka and DJT on the progress of Trump Moscow during the campaign.
#MichaelCohen  The GOP members keep saying Cohen is the first liar to be a witness to Congress. How can you claim that? There are numerous other people who have lied to Congress over the years. In fact, each time a member claims that Mr. Cohen is the first liar, they are LYING!
#MichaelCohen  Rep Hice cares more about protecting the Liar in Chief than in getting to the Truth.
#MichaelCohen  "These documents (inflated DJT income/assets) were provided to Deutsch Bank to enable him to secure a loan."
#MichaelCohen Rep Meadows is attempting to show that DJT is not a racist! Oh wow Congressman. Are you ever chasing a dead horse!
#MichaelCohen "I went into Mr Trump's office as I did each and every time about a transaction, and he told me to do it (Pay off Ms Clifford.)
#MichaelCohen "Mr Trump was concerned about (Billy Bush tape &amp; Stormy Daniels) these matters becoming public and their impact on the General Election."
#MichaelCohen "Catch and Kill - purchasing life rights to prevent publication - was a practice of DJT long before I came to work for Mr. Trump. It was in practice with Mr. Pecker and Mr. Trump."
#MichaelCohen  "The life rights of Ms Clifford were about to go to someone else and that would have impacted the campaign."
#MichaelCohen "Mr Trump did not disclose his financial because he was trying to hide the payments he made to me on the Stormy Daniels account."
#MichaelCohen "Nothing happened in the Trump organization which did not go through Mr Trump and get his sign-off."
#MichaelCohen  Congressmen Green &amp; Jordan betray the American people by attempting to obstruct the hearing in protection of DJT.
#MichaelCohen Rep. Green, the American people are watching you. We know that Mr. Cohen lied to protect DJT. What are you doing? Are you misusing your office to obstruct &amp; protect a man who does not deserve your loyalty. Don't you owe more loyalty to the American people than DJT?
#MichaelCohen "Mr Trump's desire to win (the presidency and the Moscow Tower deal) would prompt him to work with anybody."
#MichaelCohen "He is all about winning. He will do whatever is necessary to win."
#MichaelCohen  "Mr. Stone was a free agent reporting back to Mr. Trump about Wikileaks. Mr Trump took regularly took his calls."
#MichaelTrump: Debbie Wasserman-Shultz: "You testified that Mr Trump had advanced knowledge of the DNC hack dump?" "Yes. He had advanced knowledge."
#MichaelCohen "I got exactly what I wanted (in being attorney for Trump.)
#DonaldTrump Ironic seeing Rep Jordan attacking Cohen for being unethical -  an attorney going to prison for hiding Trump's illegalities -- and Jordan is using his position in Congress to protect Trump.  Weird. Ironic. Sad. Cohen is less a danger to the nation than Jordan!
#MichaelCohen "I did it to protect Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr and Ivanka Trump."
#MichaelCohen "This was after Mr. Trump supposedly gave up control of his companies. There is no doubt in my mind that Mr. Trump knew what he was paying for." (hush money to reimburse Cohen for payments to Stormy Daniels).
#MichaelCohen  "In 2016 I was contacted by Keith Davidson (Storny Daniels attn) about purchasing her life's story for $30K. Allan Weiselberg. Mr. Trump told Allen that he was going to do it &amp; that Allen &amp; I were to go back to his office &amp; discuss how to do it."
#MichaelCohen "I may not be able to change the rest, but I can do right by the American people today."
#MichaelCohen "I hope that all members of this committee from both sides of the aisle will make it clear than no one should be allowed to attempt to intimidate a witness before this committee."
#MichaelCohen "I have never asked for nor would I accept a pardon from Donald J. Trump."  "Mr. Trump called me a rat much as a mobster would do when someone is not loyal to them."
#MichaelCohen "Mr. Trump told me that Don Jr had the worst judgement and would never set up anything of importance without his father knowing."
#MichaelCohen  "I remember being in a room in early 2016  when Don Jr leaned over and spoke to his father saying --"the meeting is all set" and his father said "That's good." I know that nothing went over in Trump world without Mr. Trump in the know. "
#MichaelCohen "I never heard Mr. Trump say anything in private or in public that he loved this nation. While he was talking about cutting employees salaries, he showed me his IRS refund check and he said he thought the government was "stupid for making it so easy.."
#MIchaelCohen "While we were looking at pictures in the White House, Mr. Trump said to me: 'Don't worry Michael. Your checks have been dispatched from NY."
#MichaelCohen "I am enclosing a check Mr. Trump signed to me from his personal account paid to me when he was President of the United States to reimburse me for hush money as part of a criminal scheme directed by Mr. Trump to violate campaign finance laws."
#MichaelTrump "Mr. Trump is a con man. He asked me to pay off a porn star and to lie about it to his wife. I am enclosing Exhibit 4 - a   oopy of the check used to pay Mr. Clifford and the check Mr. Trump paid to me to reimburse me."
#MichaelCohen "The portrait was purchased by the fake bidder for $60K and it was repurchased by the Trump Foundation and the portrait was kept by Mr. Trump."
#MichaelCohen "Mr Trump is a cheat. I have given to the committee 3 years of Mr. Trump's financial statement. It was my experience that Mr. Trump inflated his assets when it served his purposes and deflated his assets .. to suit his financial interest."
#MichaelCohen "Mr. Trump knew about hacked DNC e-mails in advance. Mr. Stone told Mr. Trump over the speaker phone that Julian Assauge had a massive dump of emails from the Clinton campaign and they would be releaased soon. Mr. Trump said 'that is great.' "
#MIchaelCohen "Mr Trump never intended to lead this country. He did not expect to win. It was a marketing deal for him."
#MichaelCohen "I got to know Mr. Trump very well. When I first met him he was a real estate giant. In his presence you felt like he was changing the world..He is both good and bad but the bad far outweighs the good. Since taking office he has become the worst version of himself."
#MichaelCohen "Mom and Dad, I am sorry that I let you down." Cohen says to his parents who survived the holocaust. "For the record Individual #! is Donald J. Trump. Many times I ignored my conscience and acted loyal to Donald Trump."
#MichaelCohen "Mr Trump made it clear to me that he wanted me to lie."
#MichaelCohen "Well into the campaign Mr. Trump would ask me: 'How's it going in Moscow' referring to the Trump Tower Moscow real estate project."
#MichaelCohen "Copies of records of transactions with Deutsch Bank ... Our negotiations on Trump Tower Moscow continued into the campaign."
#MichaelCohen  Under oath Cohen says: "I regret the day I said yes to Mr. Trump. I regret all the help I gave him. ... I am ashamed." ..."He is a racist, he is a con man, he is a cheat." --"I am attaching documents."
#MichaelCohen Under oath Cohen says: "I have asked this committee to ensure that my family be protected from Presidential threats. I am here to correct the record on what I know about President Trump."
#MichaelCohen Chair Cummings may have to eject Jordan from the hearing if he continues disrupting and refusing to respect the rules of the Chair.
#MichaelCohen  I prefer a fraudster and cheat who eventually tells the truth to a politician who persists in obstructing from the American people learning the truth. Shame on Rep. Jordan. You are as much of a sleeze as Cohen - and we know what he is!
#MichaelCohen Mr. Jordan- your sleeze is evident with the first words that come out of your mouth. You are showing the American people that you are a Congressperson who cannot be trusted to look out for the Constitution and the American People. Shame on you.
#MichaelCohen Be careful Rep. Jordan. The American people are watching you today also and your protectionism over patriotism will show.
#MichaelCohen "In the end we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends." --Rep. Elijah Cummings.
#MichaelCohen Mr. Cohen has made written testimony on Russia. There are on-going DOJ investigations and we will not entertain testimony on those areas.
#MichaelCohen "I make it abundantly clear to Mr. Cohen that if he does not tell the truth today I will refer him to DOJ. He has a lot to lose if he does not tell the truth. The days of protecting the President at all cost are over." -- Rep. Elijah Cummings
#MichaelCohen Roger Stone said over speaker phone with Mr. Trump that there would be a massive dump of anti-Clinton emails by Wikileaks.
#MichaelCohen Mr. Cohen has presented a check with Mr. Trump's signature on it dated Aug 1, 2017 to reimburse Stormy Daniels. Later Mr. Trump denied knowing about $130K payment to Stormy Daniels.
#MichaelCohen "Everyone of us has a duty to serve as an independent check on the Executive Branch"-- Rep. Elijah Cummings. "Now the people can hear and make their own judgement."
#MichaelCohen This is the opportunity for the American people to judge the credibility of Cohen. Rep Cummings Chair shares that Mr. Cohen has already admitted to campaign fraud with Donald Trump.
#MichaelCohen Members will be given 5 min each to question Michael Cohen. House Oversight Committee hears public testimony today. Cohen has already testified in closed session.
#MichaelCohen The same guys who obstructed the process while the GOP was in the majority are trying to obstruct today.
#MichaelCohen Mr. Meadows:  Arguing the technicality is not in the nations' best interest. You are being petty and obstructionist. Postponing.. Thank Goodness the No's outnumbered you.
#MichaelCohen Shame on you Mr. Meadows. Late transcript is not enough reason to block Americans from hearing this testimony.

#MichaelCohen Wonder if the deniers in the "churches" will continue to claim Trump was "sent by God"
#MichaelCohen At last we get to hear some of what he has to say. Being called a liar and a cheat (even when true) by POTUS is a compliment.

@TxDPS Accident reports do not include info on model number or features of wheelchairs/scooters occupied for passengers in motor accidents. There is insufficient data to innovate and improve policies and equipment. Lack of OEM tie downs will not happen without better data.
@TxDPS 90% of motorists who kill persons in wheelchairs say they did not see them. Accident reports including info on the model of chair, curb cut, lights, reflectors, tipping etc can help improve safety in the future.
@TxDPS Persons in wheelchairs are killed by cars 3x more often than other pedestrians. Accident reports do not distinguish them from other pedestrians or record what chair model or safety equip is or is not on the DME.
@NationalADAPT Persons in wheelchairs are 3x more likely to be killed by cars than other pedestrians yet are only listed as PEDESTRIAN on accident reports. We must begin by getting the reports modified to collect data on safety features / tipping/ curb-cut/ etc.
@NationalADAPT Access to safer DME will not happen until data is reported on accidents/fatalities of persons in Whchairs/PMVs. Need to report model # &amp; features of DME of pedestrians and passengers in wheelchairs on accident reports to change Underwriting Rules.

Yes, we deserve better than David Whitley. We need to focus on WHO DIRECTED him to issue that directive, who masterminded the voter purge, who he ran the language by before he issued it.

Senator Hall: As an election judge I have turned people away who are not on the voter registration list. Provisional ballots are available for those who qualify for them.
Citizens are speaking out regarding the confirmation of David Whitley as Texas Secretary of State: https://t.co/YLTwRrUBdQ
Sen. West: "What did you do in framing your press release to be sensitive to voter suppression?"	SOS: "We are always sensitive to voter suppression."	Sen West: "How do you define voter suppression."	SOS: "It is not relevant how I define it."	Sen West sees it as very RELEVANT.
Sen. Menedez to SOS: "If you knew that the counties had naturalization data you didn't have, why didn't you ask the Counties to vet this data before you released your press release?"
Sen. Hall to SOS Whitley: "My understanding that in the past there have been waivers from the regulation that zero tapes are run before a voting machine is used. Also, it is important that tapes are run when the polls are closed before the machine leaves the polling place."
Mr. Miles: "Did the Attorney General's office take any role in shaping your press release."  Mr. Whitley: "We conferred with them on some of the legal language. We wanted to accurately portray the message."	"Mr. Miles: "Accurately portray?" 	Mr. Whitley: "Yes" https://t.co/96xWK7Qqyw
Sen Miles: "Mr. Whitley, did you or any member of your office communicate with the Governor about this advisory before it was issued."  "I speak with the Governor regularly. We communicated with the Governor's office that the press release was going to go out."
It is apparent that Mr. Whitley does not understand data maintenance and being in charge of our data bases is a very important role for the SOS.  He is an attorney but lacks some of the expertise which the people of Texas deserve their SOS to possess.
The biggest missing part of comprehension on the part of SOS Whitley remains his inability to comprehend that DPS does not have data on citizenship naturalization after a DR Lic is issued.  The SOS attempted to solve a problem without all of the data.
Only County Registrars from 200 of Texas Counties attended the SOS training on list maintenance. They were told that they were to examine the list. What about the other counties?
At this point, we do not know how many of the 95K people on the list distributed by the SOS's office are actually not citizens. https://t.co/YLTwRrUBdQ
Perhaps if SOS Whitley were not being sued, he MIGHT have been more willing to accept responsibility for his rash actions. However, we will never know because he is the defendant in numerous lawsuits. https://t.co/YLTwRrUBdQ
SOS WHITLEY "I am not qualified to answer about the technical way the list is derived."  Mr. Whitley, you do not understand enough to do the job adequately. You should step down.
The most truthful thing SOS Whitley has said thus far is "I have been sued a number of times in the last few weeks."  https://t.co/YLTwRrUBdQ
SOS Whitley is slippery. He is transferring the total responsibility to the County Registrars for the consequences of his rash action in issuing this media advisory. https://t.co/YLTwRrUBdQ
Senator Watson is concerned that people who should not have been on the list, gets a Notice of Examination of Citizenship but does not respond for various reasons, and gets removed from the rolls when they should not have been on the list to begin with. https://t.co/YLTwRrUBdQ
In Galveston County 62 citizens received notices of Examination of Citizenship in response by the County Election Administrator acting on the Media Directive of the SOS's office.  https://t.co/YLTwRrUBdQ
Mr. SOS Whitley objects to using the term "Purged" when voters are removed from the voters registration list. https://t.co/YLTwRrUBdQ
SOS Whitley did not put out any public statement saying he did not allege illegal activity of the 95K people he sent to the County Registrars and the Attorney General. His Media Directive accusing them is still on the SOS website. https://t.co/YLTwRrUBdQ
Whitley claims that he had meeting to clarify the problems from his office releasing the list. However, he still has the same media directive on the SOS website. https://t.co/YLTwRrUBdQ
SOS Whitley claims he was only preforming a maintenance activity. But his media advisory and referral to a law enforcement agency went beyond mere maintenance.  His media advisory.  https://t.co/YLTwRrUBdQ
Mr Whitley: You don't get it. YOU DID NOT HAVE "the Data." You only had part of the data. Without knowing who had been naturalized after receiving the drivers license is part of "the data" necessary to purge non-citizens from the rolls. https://t.co/YLTwRrUBdQ
Whitley won't even admit that the press release he sent out accuses people of voting illegally. This man will not accept responsibility for his actions or the consequences. SENATORS. DO NOT CONFIRM HIM AS SOS. https://t.co/YLTwRrUBdQ
Whitley refused to evaluate the process enough to understand the DPS process before he issued a list which targeted tens of thousands of Texas registered voters for purging and possible criminal prosecution. https://t.co/YLTwRrUBdQ
Whitley does not value the rights of all Texas citizens to vote PRECIOUS enough. He seems to have no empathy for a citizen who is accused of not being a citizen or of a person accused of voting illegally. https://t.co/YLTwRrUBdQ
Whitley did not take the voting rights of 95K Texans seriously enough to speak with the vendor himself. He delegated it. https://t.co/YLTwRrUBdQ
Whitley did nothing to verify before distributing the 95K names to the AG and the County Election officers. Whitley did not do his job. https://t.co/YLTwRrUBdQ
SOS Whitley's predecessor evaluated data DPS gave them and went back for better data. SOS Whitley got data, did not evaluate it before acting. There is a difference between the THOUGHT process and evaluation skill of the current and former SOS. Whitley comes up short!
Mr. Whitley: Did you stop to think that there were probably reasons why your predecessor had not jumped in and issued a directive to the counties based on this data? Shouldn't you have waited and learned more before issuing directives to the counties? You blew it sir.
Not knowing how the data is analyzed is a failure on your part Mr. Whitley. You did not check throughly before you acted. That is like putting your car into gear and driving without seeing who is in front or behind you. Please Senators: DO NOT CONFIRM HIM.
Do you think he actually told the County Registrars when he sent them the 95K that "we need to try to keep some of these folks on the rolls?"  I don't believe him. He refuses to take responsibility for the biggest public screw-up in the modern history of the Secretary of State.
SOS Whitley refused to acknowledge that he botched the process. He pleads innocence because the data came from DPS. Sorry Mr. SOS. We all get data from various sources. It is the responsibility of the person getting data to evaluate it before we share it.
If a non-citizen votes, that is a crime. To accuse 58K Texas citizens of committing a crime without KNOWING that those specific individuals are not US Citizens is accusing innocent people of committing a crime. SOS Whitley turned those names over to the Attorney General.
SOS Whitley refuses to acknowledge that he knows the list of 95K is wrong. He is trying to wiggle and squirm.
Being poised to advise /encourage county registrars to consider removing 95K registered voters from the voter rolls is not managing the voter rolls.
Mr. Whitley, you are attempting to pass the buck. You have kept a false, misleading press release on your website even after your office learned that there are not 95K people on the rolls who are not citizens. You have not corrected ANYTHING on your website. I find you insincere.
The ability to exercise good judgement with data you receive is part of your job, Mr. Secretary of State. Validate before you act is part of exercising good judgement. https://t.co/YLTwRrUBdQ
Mr. Whitley: Your office is charged with voter list maintenance. How you do it is a decision you make and you blew it sir. You risked the voting rights of tens of thousands of Texas citizens. You do not deserve to be the Secretary of State of Texas: https://t.co/YLTwRrUBdQ
SOS Whitley is outlining the voter list purge project and where it goes from here to the Texas Sen Nominations Committee: https://t.co/YLTwRrUBdQ
Mr. Whitley's testimony does not indicate that he accused tens of thousands of Texas Citizens of possibly voting illegally and turned over tens of thousand names to county election administrators to consider purging them from the voter rolls. He did not exercise due diligence.

In Texas the SOS is appointed by the GOV. The pattern of the SOS targeting legitimate citizens to remove them from the voter rolls is a pattern which targets probable Democratic voters.
Actually the 95K is over several decades not just during a 10 year period. https://t.co/ZtxsBAFuv5
Hearing Joel Osteen speaking against "being focused on ourselves" is like hearing Ted Cruz denounce shutting down the government.
In Starr Co TX the proposed wall is to run thru 162 tracts of private land, causing razing of some home.
Contractors have been given route of proposed wall but there has been no public meeting informing residents/landowners of government's plans on the wall.
"A decade ago, the feds waived a suite of federal environmental &amp; historic preservation laws .. to build segments of border wall in Rio Grande City &amp;.. Roma. ..the project there faltered amid pushback from landowners &amp; concerns about flooding the barrier would cause." TX Observer
El Paso is the safest city in USA with population over 950K. There is no crisis on the border.
They should also look into Sessions participation in discussions to lift Russian sanctions during the transition while Trump was negotiating on Trump Tower Moscow. https://t.co/Y5uL9IVstM
I agree. Shut downs should be legislatively blocked since WH and Congress have not resisted inflicting them. https://t.co/ptaAgJybbW
@MeetThePress Eminent domain appeals more to those whose land is not involved than to those who will lose their homes or farms. The proposed path of Trump's wall will probably cause more flooding.

There is no evidence that those 58K were actually non-citizens. Texas has a history of suspending people from voter rolls based on ethnicity and zip codes to limit probable Democratic voters. https://t.co/XEnkGUw4aq
Legally getting a green card or DL usually happens while immigrants are waiting to become citizens. This does not mean they were not citizens when they registered to vote!

@MeetThePress No Border Crime Crisis. 2017 (the latest yr with data) 4.4 murders per 100,000 people in Hidalgo Co. ‚Äî about 1/2 the rate of other metro areas in TX &amp; 1/4  of  murder rate in Washington, D.C. Lower than  6.3 murders per 100,000 people in 2017 in Palm Beach Co., FL
@MeetThePress Violent &amp; property crime rates in Hidalgo Co. are less than 1/2 of what they were in 1999. The majority of immigrants entering the county without papers are Central American asylum-seekers fleeing violence &amp; poverty who turn themselves over to Border Patrol ASAP.
@MeetThePress There is less crime along the Texas border than in other parts of Texas or in Washington, DC.
@MeetThePress Why have the American people and media grown desynthesized to treason by Trump and his agents?
@MeetThePress Why doesn't Session's knowledge of the Trump campaign transition team's discussing removing sanctions on Russia rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors?
@MeetThePress Why isn't discussing removing sanctions on Russia before the Inauguration enough reason for impeachment proceedings enough right now?
@MeetthePress Why aren't 100 contacts between the Trump campaign in 2015-and Jan 2017 enough to start impeachment proceedings? Why isn't treason enough of a reason to start impeachment now?
@RepJeffries You are right. Evidence based solutions are how tax dollars should be spent. File a bill to prevent shut-downs. Perhaps extend current levels of funding during months when WH &amp; or Congress are at appropriation impasse. (Remove the bone).
Would like to see legislation passed to stop future shutdowns. Perhaps extending current spending during any month when Congress &amp; or WH is at impasse. This would take the bone away from unruly dogs.

@RepKevinMcCarthy  File the bill for no member of Congress or WH to be paid during a shut-down instead of blowing smoke.
@KevinMcCarthy  @MeetThePress McCarthy lies. Dems support Peloski. Texans do not want the wall. We want real solutions. The shut-down is on the President and the GOP. McCarthy if he cared about border security would have fought to bring the gang of 8 bill to the floor.

@BillCassidy "We agree that those American workers who aren't getting paid deserve to get paid... It is time to move forward, to negotiate and move forward."  Sorry Sen. it is not a personality conflict between the Speaker. It is the PREZ!
Senate should not complicate reopening govt with conditions. Open the Govt and pass 3 week CR and work to find solutions.
@SenatorIsakson Thank you for telling the truth. The Senators should listen to you.
A bi partisan amendment for a CR for 3 weeks will get employees back to work and to get paid. Will allow House &amp; Senate 3 weeks to work on priorities. If Trump requires Wall it won't pass.
Trump is requiring money for a wall to get the 3 week CR to reopen the government.  This is still a GOP gun to the head demanding the wall to open the govt!

Prez's proposal makes radical changes to asylum law and funds his wall. The other is a short term bill which makes no conditions merely reopens the government. It should not be controversial. It is what the Republicans voted for a month ago.

@SenTedCruz Don't insult us. We understand exactly what is going on right now on the Senate floor. We know you are trying to white wash that your President and Party shut down the govt and refused to bring bills to the Senate floor for 32 days to reopen it. You are blowing smoke.
@SenatorCruz_ I detest you more than Trump because you are smart enough to know better. Smoke and Mirrors won't work Senator. We want EVERY EMPLOYEE PAID. Not just military or coast guard. OPEN GOVT without wall then consider real solutions.
@SenatorCruz_ Why are there tunnels under the existing wall if walls will keep people out? Walls are not effective unless they are on 4 sides. Will your pet stay in your yard if the fence is only on one side? WASTE OF MONEY SENATOR. Waste of money.
@SenatorCruz_ You have screamed ... You are the obstruction Sen Cruz. I wish that Sen. Bennet were our Senator instead of you. You dishonor our state.

Senator Michael Bennet's speech now on the floor of the Senate is one of the best every made in the history of Congress.
@SenatorBennet "Can you imagine what the people of Co would do if we proposed eminent domaine to steal land through Rocky Mountains and build a fence across Pikes' Peak."
@SenatorBennet of CO  His floor speech should be watched! He authored a bill that would have solved our border problems which passed the Senate but the Freedom Caucus in the House blocked it. That is the kind of solution. We should reopen today &amp; find real solution.
Democrats have passed bills with $46Billion in border security and doubled number of border security agents plus technology, that bill passed the Senate but the Haslett Rule kept it from getting  vote in the House.  The Freedom Caucus blocked that bill.
Time after time Democrats have supported REAL BORDER Security.
Sen Bennet of CO is roasting Ted Cruz for his tactics and two-faced dealings. He is calling Cruz out for wanting to use eminent domain to steal land to build a wall. Thank you Sen. from CO!
We do not want small solutions. We want the GOVT opened. We want all employees paid and all agencies staffed and funded. Your arguing about the coast guard is smoke and mirrors and we see through you. @SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @MichaelBennet @SenatorCollins
@SenTedCruz You have said the wall is not the solution yet you are not fighting to reopen the govt and pay ALL EMPLOYEES without the wall. Your arguement is disingenuous.
Sen Cruz is arguing for paying the Coast Guard without paying the other federal employees.

The only bill which gives Congress opportunity to debate and seek real solutions is the one by the Dems to reopen and fund until Feb. 8. The GOP bill is a gun to the head without debate or committee examination. https://t.co/ykMYz9UAcp
Our founding fathers were wise not to trust career legislators. Watching the Senate today is demoralizing.
Senate is voting on motion to proceed on consideration of S1 - the largest Israel appropriation in US History! They prioritize that above our own government.
@SenatorBlunt Negotiations should be when Govt is open not while closed. The Dem's bill is the only one that allows that. You are not going to be able to get by with this disingenious vote. The shut down will remain on you.
@SenatorBlunt You are disingenious when you claim this bill is truly about helping DACA. It is taking away to appear to give back. Shame on you Senator. Voting for the Dem's bill will show you want to get things done.
Sen. Roy Blunt (R) MO says we should keep DACA here. He ignores that a 3 yr instead of citizenship leaves them in limbo and kicks the "can" to the next administration. This bill does not do the job Sen. Blunt. @SenatorBlunt
Sen Roy Blunt (R) MO say "American people expect the government to work. Democracy is about compromise." He is correct but his conclusion that  Trump's bill is a compromise is false. True, Feb 8  D's funding ends. Sen Blunt ignores the majority of Americans don't want the  wall
Sen Tim Kaine: We should put the President's bill into the committee so that both party's can consider and comment on it. A compromise is not presenting a bill without talking to the other side about it or allowing debate or committee consideration.
Sen. Tim Kaine: Dems object to shutting down the govt.  The issue is not negotiation over border security. The issue is legitimacy of shutting down the government when you don't get your way. The proposal offered by the President is not a compromise.

The men on that committee are thinking back to stupid things they did in College and High School and superimposing their fears onto this situation. However, none of the members of the committee are appointed for life.
How does keeping information confidential for 6 weeks compare to blocking President Obama's nominee for a year!
Being  judge doesn't keep you from being an assh*le. Bailey Moseley is an example that illustrates that truth!
Since Maryland has no statue of limitation on sexual assault, it is unlikely that anyone in that room other than Dr. Ford would refute Kavanaugh's account unless granted immunity from prosecution.
Statue of limitation for sexual assault/rape should be removed. If trauma cannot be erased, there should be no statue of limitation on prosecuting a crime.
Republican senators would have dragged Mark Judge to the hearing if they thought he had anything positive to say about Brett Kavanaugh. https://t.co/uVYNNIdRqu via @HuffPostPol
I have sympathy for Kavanaugh's family, especially his daughters and parents, but he has more to gain by being believed than Dr. Ford has for coming forward.  He is fighting for his career. She is coming forward because this is a lifetime judiciary appointment.
Ten days is YEARS less than most sexual assault survivors wait to be heard.
in 99% of the cases the sexual attacker claims the survivor is "mistaken", "not telling the truth", "or lying." The refrain is "I didn't do it!" Today I believe Dr. Ford. Kanaugh's testimony makes me more certain he's guilty.
Only about 1% of the rapes in the USA result in jail time for the rapist.
I believe Dr. Ford. Kavanaugh sounds like a bully.
Poor Brett Kavanaugh! I don't buy it.  Your good name was a sham. "Revenge on behalf of the Clinton!"  No, this is your chicks coming home to roost.  What goes around is coming around and you sexually assaulted a teenage girl when you were old enough to know it was wrong.
The "Prosecutor" Rachel Mitchell will present the nominee in the best light. The Chair and majority of the Judiciary Committee are debasing the process by refusing to seek the truth rather than protecting the President's nominee
These Judicary Committee members cannot resist speaking to reporters. Even though they have hidden behind a female prosecutor, they will still show their deplorable greed as they speak to reporters.
The prosecutor does not give you enough cover, GOP members of this committee! We see through this. You know that if YOU questioned her your temper and partisanship before the cameras would not fly well during the mid terms! Calling the Democratic members partisan is rather lame!
Senator Graham: If Mark Judge is innocent, why doesn't he come forward. Why are you more concerned about protecting him from tough questioning? Are only women the ones subjected to tough questioning before your committee?
Senator Lindsey Graham: Beware. There are MANY of us out here who have experienced sexual assault and we know what we know and also know there are things we can't remember. I only have to assume how I got home one very bad night in the 1980s.
Senator Lindsey Graham: Why are the mid terms more important that being sure of the character of a lifetime judicial appointment to the highest court of the land.
Sen Lindsey Graham: The American people feel ambused by your ramming this nomination through.  Your interview and indignation is insulting to the millions of survivors who are watching this nomination closely.
Neither party should be prosecuting the testimony of Dr. Ford. Prosecuting instead of equally seeking the truth to acertain the character of the SCOTUS nominee does not serve the good of the nation.
IF Mark Judge is innocent, why is he hiding?
Years later Mark Judge is hiding out at a beach house. Misbehavior comes home to roost. Hide Mark Hide.
The Republican Senators on the Judicial Committee hired a female prosecutor to question Dr. Ford because they prefer to avoid news clips of them being their natural level of obnoxious.
WHERE IS MARK JUDGE? Why has he not been subpoenaed.
The Judicary Committee could have had the person who administered the polygraph test testify and they would have testimony on the methodology. However the Chair and majority did not invite the technician-- probably because they are interested in cramming through the nomination.
Trump is a predator and supports placing other predators in high places. Trump's failure to order an FBI investigation of  the allegations against his SCOTUS nominee is not surprising. Predators protect and encourage other predators.
It took decades to get laws and INS policies changed to allow human trafficking victims to get far enough away from the border and those who are connected to the predators in their home country so that they can safely tell their stories. Trump adm. revoked those policies.
Sexual predators come in all genders and sexual orientations. Although more women and girls are reported as victims, survivors are of all genders. There are many more survivors than predators. Predators are usually serial offenders.
For sexual assault survivors years may pass and a word or action unrelated to sex will trigger fight or flight responses. Sometimes it is from someone attempting to manipulated or control or coerce. The  level of resistance encountered once triggered is formidable.
The Senate Judiciary Committee refused to allow the witness who performed the polygraph test to testify. Shame on the Chairman of the Committee!
Most sexual predators minimize the impact of sexual abuse on people and society. NO SEXUAL PREDATOR should be in any Criminal Justice/Judicial office.
Sexual predators rarely stop with one victim.
The assumption -- hope -- is that eventually sexual assault and trauma can be forgotten. The reality is that even when stuffed down into as far back as we can get it, sexual assault is rarely forgotten. The violence and control distinguish it from other experiences.
Dr. Ford is a PhD researcher, author, professor and respects truth and precision in communication.

In the 1980s sexual assault victims were treated even worse than today. Sexual assault by persons known to the victim were usually discounted. There has been some improvement in the methodology or questioning, but we still do not take victims seriously.
"Sincere, through investigation is rare  for sexual assault/rape survivors. If it were normal we would not have backlogs of rape DNA tests rotting on shelves untested.
Republicans beware. 1 out of 3 and 1 out of 6 crosses party lines. We are of all races, all professions, all levels of education. We have not forgotten our experiences and we know why we kept silent or waited so long to tell our stories. Our numbers exceed normal voter turnout.
Mark Judge should be forced to testify before this goes to the floor of the senate.
Watching the demeanor of the senators on break following the first session of Dr. Ford's testimony, most seem solemn but John Cornyn appears arrogant and laughing. He has made up his mind and the seriousness of rape and sexual assault appear of little significance to him.
