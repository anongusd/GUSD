On February 24, the Cuban communist regime held what it called a “national referendum” on revisions to its constitution. No one should be fooled by this exercise, which achieves little beyond perpetuating the pretext for regime’s one-party dictatorship. https://t.co/dDdz6EW56B

We note @JZarif’s resignation. We’ll see if it sticks. Either way, he and @HassanRouhani are just front men for a corrupt religious mafia. We know @khamenei_ir makes all final decisions. Our policy is unchanged—the regime must behave like a normal country and respect its people.
The U.S. welcomes the recovery of U.S. Citizen Danny Burch held hostage in Yemen. Thanks to our partners in #UAE, @StateSPEHA, @USAinUAE, and the Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell for their efforts. The safety of Americans is a high priority of the @realDonaldTrump Administration.

I had the opportunity to meet with @USAmbQatar Charge Bill Grant and the @USEmbassyQatar team. Thank you for all of your work! https://t.co/Dobh5nfHTn
I'm in Doha for our second annual U.S.-Qatar Strategic Dialogue. Met today with @MBA_AlThani_ to discuss #Iran, #Afghanistan and other areas of cooperation. We agreed on ways to build upon the robust #USQatar partnership. https://t.co/zkcJYM0JlD
Great to meet with students at NYU Abu Dhabi, who’ve all come here for a first-class American education — one of our most important exports. Thought-provoking discussion about American leadership. https://t.co/XEybwynDkQ

I had a great meeting today with HM King Hamad and Crown Prince Salman. The U.S.-#Bahrain partnership continues to thrive, from cooperation on #Iran, #Yemen, and counterterrorism to Bahrain’s hosting of the @US5thFleet. https://t.co/2dI7N0B8Xk
I am pleased to announce that the U.S. and #Poland will jointly host the Ministerial to Promote a Future of Peace and Security in the Middle East in Warsaw on Feb. 13-14. It will be a forum for countries to address a range of critical issues toward a more peaceful Middle East. https://t.co/IS8oPP4Aqs
Inspiring to visit the recently inaugurated Cathedral of the Nativity and al-Fattah al-Aleem Mosque. @AlsisiOfficial’s commitment to promoting #religiousfreedom and interfaith tolerance sets an example for the region to follow. https://t.co/i4fWvHTsVX
The National Assembly carries the flame of democracy on behalf of #Venezuela through these dark days of the #Maduro dictatorship.  We applaud its efforts to recover stolen funds for the Venezuelan people.  Thank you for your leadership, @jguaido.
The U.S. condemns #Maduro’s illegitimate usurpation of power and urges those who support the Venezuelan regime, including security forces sworn to support the constitution, to stop enabling repression and corruption. The time is NOW for a return to democracy in #Venezuela.
Met today with our dedicated @USEmbassyCairo employees and their families and thanked them for their hard work improving U.S.-Egypt ties. https://t.co/qW7dksZBG8
American troops are coming home from Syria, but this isn’t a change of mission. We remain committed to the complete dismantling of the ISIS threat and the ongoing fight against radical Islamist terror. We are looking to our partners to do more going forward. https://t.co/pIuZFfECp2
Our aim is to partner with our friends and vigorously oppose our enemies, because a strong, secure, and economically vibrant Middle East is in our national interest. https://t.co/MVcf3fDctW
Nations are rallying to confront #Iran’s revolutionary agenda like never before: Cutting Iran’s oil imports to zero, thwarting sanctions evasion, countering terrorism in Europe &amp; isolating Iran’s corrupt banking system. The world is recognizing the full scope of Iran's threats. https://t.co/6y8r4uxpRV
America helped free North Africa from the Nazis &amp; assembled a coalition to free Kuwait from Saddam Hussein. Thanks to the U.S. and our partners, 99% of ISIS territory is liberated &amp; thousands of lives have been saved. https://t.co/sJkqvWJ9qf

#Iran and Hizballah have terrorized Europe since 1979. By taking action today, European nations sent Iran a clear message that terrorism will not be tolerated. The U.S. strongly supports the new sanctions and stands with our European allies as we counter this common threat.
Today, EU issued its first sanctions against the Iranian regime since the Iran deal, and the Netherlands disclosed that #Iran directed the assassinations of two Dutch nationals in 2015 and 2017. This follows Denmark and France foiling two Iranian terrorist attacks in 2018. https://t.co/tz7U4pTLh8
Productive meeting with @KingAbdullahII and @AymanHsafadi today. We’ll continue to work together to support our countries’ strong, enduring friendship and to make progress on #Syria and other key regional issues. https://t.co/HMHlpgp5Qm
Just landed in Jordan, my first stop on an 8-day Mideast tour. Looking forward to discussing the U.S. withdrawal from #Syria and our continuing #defeatISIS campaign. Our tactics have changed, not the mission! https://t.co/xNh9a6ml2x
Heading to the Middle East today to send a clear message to our friends and partners that the U.S. is committed to the region, committed to #defeatISIS, and committed to counter Iran’s destabilizing activities. https://t.co/TUHv3BeNHh
America will miss the dedicated service to Kansas and our Nation of @PatRoberts. Pat and Franki are good friends who have been most gracious to Susan and me. I even got a Marine to introduce an Army guy at two confirmation hearings! Blessings to you, Pat.
The U.S. applauds the #LimaGroup for standing up for democracy in #Venezuela and denouncing #Maduro's upcoming sham inauguration. The elections in Venezuela were flawed, unfree, and unfair. We stand with the region to demand the restoration of democracy and fundamental freedoms.
#Iran plans to fire off Space Launch Vehicles with virtually same technology as ICBMs. The launch will advance its missile program. US, France, UK &amp; Germany have already stated this is in defiance of UNSCR 2231. We won't stand by while the regime threatens international security.
Less than two hours on the ground must be a @StateDept record -- but meeting with key U.S. partner #Colombia is crucial to keeping Americans safe and prosperous. We'll continue working closely with Colombia and all of our partners in the Western Hemisphere. https://t.co/mUB8v1QclV
President @IvanDuque of #Colombia and I had a frank and open meeting on our shared goals: less coca cultivation, #humanrights, fair and reciprocal trade, and an end to the #Venezuela humanitarian crisis. Colombia remains a genuine and steadfast U.S. partner. https://t.co/A7Ug8xPRD4

Met Peruvian Foreign Minister @NestorPopolizio and thanked him for his work to counter corruption. We also discussed counternarcotics cooperation and the need to keep pressure on the corrupt #Maduro regime, which has starved Venezuelans and forced 3 million to flee. https://t.co/p4JcAuZ44k
Just arrived in #Brasilia for the @jairbolsonaro inauguration. Looking forward to witnessing the peaceful transfer of power in one of Latin America's strongest democracies. https://t.co/sMuCtzsOql
From our family to yours, wishing our @StateDept team and the American people we serve a very #MerryChristmas, a happy holiday season, and a happy new year! May your days be full of peace and your New Year filled with joy. Look forward to seeing you around the world in #2019! https://t.co/DhNwkD9lsH
As the proud people of #Iran celebrate the longest night of the year &amp; the victory of light over darkness, I wish for them prosperity and freedom. As the Persian poet Nezami said, “even in hopelessness there is hope; at the end of a dark night there is light.” Happy #Yalda!
I commend PM Edi Rama’s expulsion of two Iranian agents who plotted terrorist attacks in #Albania. European nations have thwarted three Iranian plots this year alone. The world must stand together to sanction #Iran’s regime until it changes its destructive behavior.
Our work to advance American diplomacy would not be possible without our strong, loving, and supportive @StateDept families. To the children, spouses, and family members, especially those separated this holiday season, thank you. We are grateful for your sacrifice and commitment. https://t.co/eXUT3i6ZHG
As communities around America pause today to remember, honor and teach with @WreathsAcross, I share my heartfelt thank you to those who have served and those who have supported. #NeverForget and never stop standing up for freedom at home and abroad. https://t.co/1yvS4nBZrB
Glad to host @Canada FM @cafreeland &amp; Defense Minister @HarjitSajjan with @DeptofDefense #SecDef Mattis at the @StateDept today.

Encouraging news today from @OSE_Yemen consultations in Sweden. Negotiators made progress on a cease-fire and withdrawal of forces in Hudaydah. Peace is possible. Let’s make this the start of a new chapter for #Yemen. https://t.co/VBZL4VfIAp
Great to be in studio today with @foxandfriends. We discussed the tragic attack in #Strasbourg, our work with #Mexico on border security, countering Russian, Iranian and Chinese aggression, and ensuring American foreign policy serves the American people. https://t.co/BsIAfd4oxc
The U.S. will be relentless in building a coalition to confront the Iranian regime’s ballistic missile activity—and other malign behavior, including the abuse of its own people. We will keep standing with ordinary Iranians, who are the regime’s longest-suffering victims. https://t.co/aO4oiWdNTz
Thanks to France, Germany, and the UK for joining the U.S. in raising concerns about the Iranian regime’s reckless missile activity. #Iran is in open defiance of #UNSCR 2231. That’s indisputable. https://t.co/QYl16MpCp2
#Iran’s regime has exploited the goodwill of nations and defied multiple #UNSC Resolutions in pursuit of a ballistic missile force. The United States will never stand for this. No nation that seeks peace and prosperity in the Middle East should either. https://t.co/oqlDg6VELu
Happy Justice Gorsuch joined us at the swearing in of A/S Leg. Affairs Mary Elizabeth Taylor. Her experience on the Hill &amp; at @WhiteHouse make her the ideal choice for this critical role at @StateDept. She’s already hard at work getting our 70+ nominations across the finish line. https://t.co/xQh8nafAZ5
#Russia's government has sent bombers halfway around the world to #Venezuela. The Russian and Venezuelan people should see this for what it is: two corrupt governments squandering public funds, and squelching liberty and freedom while their people suffer. https://t.co/bCBGbGtaHT
As #Yemen consultations with @OSE_Yemen progress in Sweden, the U.S. urges all parties to continue engaging to achieve concrete, positive outcomes for the people of Yemen.
Back in 1947, @USMC started @ToysForTots_USA, collecting and delivering toys to kids in tough circumstances. @StateDept does its part, because we know that Christmas is about giving, not receiving. And when we give, we ignite a small flame of hope. Merry Christmas, everyone. https://t.co/Q17cqPixFU
On this #HumanRightsDay, spare a moment to remember the innocent Americans held hostage by #Iran, and their families. The regime must release Bob Levinson and all other U.S. hostages immediately. #FreeIranHostages @HelpBobLevinson https://t.co/3d4qqqG8Bf

Very pleased with @POTUS' intent to nominate Heather Nauert as @USUN Amb. She's traveled with me since Day One as @UnderSecPD &amp; @statedeptspox. I have great confidence in her. Heather plays a key role in advancing U.S. foreign policy &amp; I look forward to her speedy confirmation.
We mark #PearlHarbor Remembrance Day by honoring the patriots who perished more than seven decades ago, extending our thoughts and prayers to the loved ones they left behind, and showing our gratitude to a generation of service members who carried our Nation. https://t.co/QoYyDLWryI
Just days after #Hamas indiscriminately fired thousands of missiles at #Israel’s citizens, @UN could not muster a resolution condemning this band of terrorists. This is yet another disgraceful act of bias toward the Jewish State.
I consider it a great privilege to have known President Bush. Devoted husband, loving father, steadfast friend, exemplary patriot: this is how I will always remember him. My condolences to the Bush family on the passing of a great man. https://t.co/VP0RVD9a12
President George H.W. Bush was an unyielding champion of freedom. He demonstrated that whether serving in the @USNavy during WWII or leading our country in the @WhiteHouse. He was one of America’s most consequential and dedicated public servants. His legacy inspires all of us. https://t.co/tIFhs5yARK
Today, I join President @realDonaldTrump and the American people in mourning President George Herbert Walker Bush and celebrating his incredible life, one that embodied the best of America in his devotion to public service and country. https://t.co/B8F39km0Rk

Very good meeting with Libyan PM al-Sarraj. Reaffirmed our support for SRSG @GhassanSalame as he works with Libyans toward National Conference &amp; electoral process. Our shared goal is a stable, unified #Libya standing on its own with security &amp; economic prosperity for all Libyans.
U.S. and @NATO Allies strongly support the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and NATO aspirations of Georgia and Ukraine. We value their contributions and cooperation and are encouraged by progress made toward meeting #NATO standards and values. https://t.co/16ESJy5a7E
If #Russia admits its #INF violations and fully and verifiably comes back into compliance we will welcome that course of action. But only Russia can take this step. Appreciate @NATO’s strong support for our decision. https://t.co/SeSuTKcoeA
#Russian violations of #INF are part of the larger pattern of Russian lawlessness on the world stage: Georgia, Ukraine, Syria, election meddling, #Skripal, and now the #Kerch Strait, to name just a few. https://t.co/Njs62duHfH
Our nations have a choice: bury our head in the sand or take commonsense action in response to Russia’s flagrant disregard of #INF. #Russia has violated since 2000’s, while U.S remained in scrupulous INF compliance. https://t.co/C9bsL60sqB
The U.S. today declares it has found Russia in material breach of the treaty and will suspend our obligations as a remedy effective in 60 days unless Russia returns to full and verifiable compliance. https://t.co/si60tWPfLm
Our mission is to reassert our sovereignty, reform the liberal international order, and we want our friends to help us and to exert their sovereignty as well. We aspire to make the international order serve our citizens—not to control them. America intends to lead—now and always. https://t.co/6qcN7apGoz
Every nation must honestly acknowledge its responsibilities to its citizens and ask if the current international order serves the good of its people. And if not, we must ask how we can right it. This is what @POTUS is doing. He sees the world as it is, not as we wish it to be. https://t.co/k9iG6SBBrd
International bodies must help facilitate cooperation that bolsters the security &amp; values of the free world, or they must be reformed or eliminated. When treaties are broken, the violators must be confronted &amp; the treaties must be fixed or discarded. Words should mean something. https://t.co/i5AUiXLNMh
The men who rebuilt Western civilization after WWII knew that only strong U.S. leadership could unite sovereign nations around the globe. This allowed us to enjoy the greatest human flourishing in modern history. This is the leadership @POTUS is boldly reasserting. https://t.co/sWnaWf7lDD
At #NATO meeting with @jensstoltenberg, I expressed @Potus determination to make @nato as strong &amp; resilient as possible.

My very first trip after I was named Secretary of State was to @NATO. I repeat what I said then – it is an “indispensable” institution. To that end, all NATO Allies should work to strengthen what is already the greatest military alliance in history.
.@SecPompeo at @gmfus “Prez Bush would have been delighted to be here today at an institution named after a fellow lover of freedom, George Marshall. He would have been thrilled to see a large crowd so dedicated to our transatlantic bonds, so many decades after they were forged.”
Good morning from #Brussels! I had a good  meeting with Belgian PM @CharlesMichel to discuss our long-standing partnership. The success, prosperity and security of the United States and Belgium are anchored in a history of strong cooperation across the Atlantic. @StateDept https://t.co/bfqRHXqdx9

The Iranian regime has just test-fired a medium range ballistic missile that’s capable of carrying multiple warheads.  This test violates UNSCR 2231.   Iran’s missile testing &amp; missile proliferation is growing. We condemn this act and call upon Iran to cease these activities.
Our American flag in Argentina flies at half staff in honor of President Bush.

Iran’s regime has no interest in easing Yemeni suffering; the mullahs don’t even care for ordinary Iranians. Saudi Arabia has invested billions to relieve suffering in #Yemen. Iran has invested zero.
Through our generous example, the U.S. has galvanized humanitarian assistance to ease Yemeni people’s suffering. Today we’re announcing nearly $131 million in additional food assistance in #Yemen, bringing total humanitarian aid to more than $697 million over the past 14 months.
The Trump Administration’s effort to rebuild the U.S.-#Saudi partnership isn’t popular in the salons of Washington, but the kingdom is a force for stability in the Mideast. Degrading our ties would be a mistake for U.S. national security. Read my op-ed: https://t.co/DcUyXYd1os

.@khamenei_ir should decide if spending the Iranian people’s money on the Iranian people is more important than inventing schemes to fund Assad, Hizballah, Hamas, and other terrorists.
Today’s @USTreasury action targeting the Russia-Iran oil scheme to prop up Assad, and finance Hizballah &amp; Hamas, sends a clear message: there are grave consequences for anyone shipping oil to Syria, or trying to evade U.S. sanctions on the Islamic Republic’s terrorist activities.

Shame on #FakeNewsweek for helping @JZarif spread lies. The truth is: the U.S. does not, and never did, sanction food and medicine. They are exempt from sanctions, as are financial transactions related to humanitarian needs.

Thanks @USAmbFrance for hosting a great dinner with business leaders in #Paris. The trade and investment between our two countries is immensely beneficial to us all. https://t.co/z203D5V8ZR
Saddened by the death and devastation of the California fires. Offering thanks to the brave first responders and keeping those affected in my prayers.
Had a productive meeting with Foreign Minister @JY_LeDrian today discussing a range of bilateral, regional, and global issues. https://t.co/HR6rUXDiMy
Last year, @POTUS Trump laid out our vision for a free and open #IndoPacific. This week, @VP Pence travels to the region to discuss progress on making this vision a reality and affirm that our commitment to the Indo-Pacific is steadfast and enduring. https://t.co/a6ILOkTntp
Happy 243rd birthday, @USMC! On behalf of @StateDept, I am proud to celebrate the service and commitment of Marines past and present, and give a special thanks to the men and women who protect our diplomatic posts around the world. #MarineCorpsBirthday https://t.co/cLkwzfrtfh
Inspiring to return to #France, the land of America’s oldest ally, as Secretary of State alongside @POTUS to renew our countries’ shared values. https://t.co/TW1UMZQ6K7

It was my pleasure to join @USTreasury Secretary @stevenmnuchin1 for our #Iran policy briefing with the foreign press corps based in Washington. Thanks to @ForeignPressCtr for hosting us! https://t.co/9k88IoMjxw
ایالات متحده با ایستادن در کنار مردم ایران با آنها ابراز همبستگی می کند.  مردم ایران پس از گذشت تقریبا ۴٠سال بیشترین صدمه را از سو مدیریت و فساد اقتصادی خورده اند.  برخلاف آنچه رژیم ایران می گوید، تحریم های ما شامل فروش غذا، محصولات کشاورزی، دارو، و تجهیزات پزشکی نمی شود. https://t.co/J7aLVFCaTk
Companies risk their reputation engaging with #Iran’s regime, which spreads violence and instability in the region and around the world. Companies that evade our sanctions and continue sanctionable commerce with the Iranian regime will face severe penalties. https://t.co/sGbl5I5UpH
The U.S. has reimposed tough sanctions on #Iran’s regime as part of our relentless pressure campaign to convince the regime to change its destructive behavior. Iran’s regime has a choice: change its behavior and act like a normal country or watch the escalating pressure continue. https://t.co/Yg0e8ovDPs
Enjoyed the conversation this morning with @jdickerson on @FaceTheNation. Covered #Iran sanctions, #NorthKorea, and more. The Trump Administration is working hard on behalf of the American people. https://t.co/3DL0wEsKzz
Good to be back on @FoxNewsSunday with Chris Wallace. Discussed tomorrow’s sanctions snapback on #Iran’s regime and other foreign policy developments. https://t.co/dL7a1RjGcB
Today marks the 39th anniversary of the U.S. embassy takeover in Tehran, when more than 50 of our colleagues were taken hostage. Their courage &amp; resolve over 444 days in captivity continues to underscore our commitment to compel #Iran to permanently abandon its outlaw activities.
On November 5, we will place tough sanctions on #Iran’s ruling regime. Our aim is to compel Iran to abandon its destructive activities. The sanctions will target the regime—not the people, who have suffered the pain of their government’s mismanagement, theft, and brutality.
We congratulate the government of #Denmark on its arrest of an Iranian regime assassin. For nearly 40 years, Europe has been the target of #Iran-sponsored terrorist attacks. We call on our allies and partners to confront the full range of Iran’s threats to peace and security.
The International Monetary Fund @IMFNews is projecting a 3.6% decline in #Iran’s economy next year. That’s what happens when the ruling regime steals from its people and invests in Assad—instead of creating jobs for Iranians, they ruin the economy.
The murder of innocent people attending Sabbath services at the #TreeOfLifeSynagogue was an act of anti-Semitism and pure evil. We offer condolences to the victims’ families and gratitude to the brave first responders. May God comfort the Jewish community at this time of sorrow.
Today, we celebrate 20 years since the creation of our International #ReligiousFreedom office. Where this human right flourishes, there's greater stability and more economic opportunity. Thanks to @IRF_Ambassador Brownback for carrying the torch on this foreign policy priority.

Addressed the White House Fellows today and thanked them for contributing to our mission of serving the American people. Shared @POTUS’ key foreign policy principles: respect for national sovereignty; serving U.S. interests and values; and fairness and reciprocity. https://t.co/PU5a1wBg8j
We’re encouraged by high voter turnout in #Afghanistan’s parliamentary elections. We commend Afghan security forces in their efforts to facilitate credible elections. We’re committed to assisting the elections commissions, especially in their work for the presidential election. https://t.co/T4C2Y6XNc3
Last week, #Cuba’s diplomats threw a childish temper tantrum at a U.S.-sponsored #UN meeting highlighting the Cuban regime’s repressive and abusive treatment of political prisoners. I’ve written @antonioguterres asking what measures will be taken in response to these actions. https://t.co/SXrVhuRKeb
The U.S. has a message for those in the caravan—you will not be successful getting into the United States. If you seek to come here as a refugee—go through the normal refugee process. You will not be granted entry into the U.S. through the illegal means of this caravan. https://t.co/AFLm9DTX6F

Looking forward to discussing with President @EPN &amp; FM @LVidegaray our joint efforts to curb illegal immigration into the United States and how we can support #Mexico and @Refugees in this effort.

Great seeing President @JC_Varela &amp; VP/FM @IsabelStMalo of #Panama today. They’re leading the efforts on critical regional security matters, such as fighting drugs and illegal immigration.

The U.S. is determined to pursue a maximum pressure campaign to confront the regime in #Iran, which defies international norms, abuses the Iranian people’s human rights, and spreads death and destruction around the world. Read my @ForeignAffairs op-ed: https://t.co/BtJOa0otJl
I’m pleased to announce the merger of @usembassyjlm &amp; @USCGJerusalem into a single mission. This will improve efficiency &amp; effectiveness. It doesn’t signal a change of U.S. policy.

Honored to join @POTUS to greet Pastor Brunson in the Oval Office. He and his family suffered a great deal. Glad he’s home in the U.S., where he’s free to practice his faith. We call on #Turkey to speedily release all wrongfully detained Americans and our locally employed staff.
On behalf of the @StateDept: Welcome home, Pastor Brunson!
A big @StateDept (and #USArmy) happy birthday to America’s seapower, @USNavy! Thank you Sailors, past and present, for your service, sacrifice, and commitment to keeping America safe. #243NavyBDay #ForgedBytheSea https://t.co/Z7HSKbDK52

Thanks to SFRC and Senate leaders for helping us get our team on the field. @StateDept
It’s a great day for America! Another American citizen has been released. The world should know that @POTUS and @StateDept continue to work hard to bring home all American hostages and those wrongfully imprisoned and detained.
Pastor Brunson is finally coming home to America, following a long ordeal for the pastor and his family.  We hope that the Turkish government will quickly release our other detained U.S. citizens and @StateDept locally employed staff.
In the entire Middle East, there is only one consistently pro-American, free enterprise, democratic nation. And that is the State of #Israel. Under @POTUS’ leadership, the United States is standing firmly on the side of Israel, and our relationship is stronger than ever. https://t.co/TltRafHnB0
The extradition of Iranian “diplomat” Asadollah Assadi from Germany to Belgium for his role in the plot to bomb a rally near Paris reminds us of #Iran’s continued support of terrorism in Europe.

Today’s @CIJ_ICJ ruling was a defeat for #Iran, which has hypocritically and groundlessly abused the court as a forum for attacking the U.S. In light of this, I am announcing that the U.S. is terminating the Treaty of Amity w/ Iran -- this is a decision that is 39 years overdue. https://t.co/Cd7yRkd0go

#Iran’s regime violates the basic human rights of its own people. Today, there are over 800 prisoners of conscience. The regime targets journalists and restricts freedom of expression. Watch this video on the injustice of life under Iran’s outlaw regime. https://t.co/D2hLiWLzgf

Very positive meeting with #DPRK Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho @UNGA to discuss upcoming summit &amp; next steps toward denuclearization of #NorthKorea. Much work remains, but we will continue to move forward.  @StateDept https://t.co/O376apkrBd
Earlier, @nytimes decided to selectively quote @CIA Director Haspel on #DPRK’s willingness to denuclearize. Let me help you with the rest of the quote: “[Chairman Kim] has stated that he is interested in and committed to denuclearizing his country...”
#Iran’s President @HassanRouhani said, “many people have lost their faith in the future of the Islamic Republic &amp; are in doubt about its power.” That’s understandable when 1/3 of Iranian youth are unemployed, while government parking garages are filled with Range Rovers &amp; BMWs. https://t.co/MsdeQaUZyY
Recently, #Iran-supported militias in Iraq launched rocket attacks against the U.S. embassy in Baghdad and our consulate in Basra. We’ll hold #Iran’s regime accountable for any attack on our personnel or facilities, and respond swiftly and decisively in defense of American lives. https://t.co/nqbmogbeCA
The UN Charter calls for nations to “live together in peace with one another as good neighbors.” Has the regime in #Iran lived together with other nations in peace? Has it been a good neighbor? Look around the world and you’ll see the answer is a deafening “no.” https://t.co/rv2p7DqByH

Religious freedom is a fundamental human right that flows from the inherent dignity of each person. #VVS18 https://t.co/0HrZlBGuui
Looking forward to speaking today at #VVS18 to highlight how @StateDept is fighting to make sure American citizens and American interests come first in our foreign policy, and that American values go forward all over the world.

The U.S. prioritizes a course of action that allows refugees to go home safely and voluntarily when conditions permit – a solution that most refugees prefer, and reflects our commitment to achieving the best humanitarian outcomes, in keeping with our longstanding policy.
Our proposal of resettling up to 30,000 refugees under a new ceiling reflects the United States' longstanding record as the most generous nation in the world for protection-based immigration and assistance.
We encourage U.S. citizens affected by the typhoon to check-in with loved ones directly or by updating social media. If you are a U.S. citizen in need of assistance after the storm, contact your nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate. https://t.co/L49kUQJ34B

The U.S. called a meeting of #UNSC today to discuss sanctions on #NorthKorea and #Russia’s active attempts to undermine compliance with those sanctions. Global sanctions are an essential part of efforts to achieve denuclearization. We are as committed as ever to enforcing them.
Come November 4th, there will be a different set of rules for anyone who wants to engage in economic activity with the regime in #Iran. Many countries are already taking actions to leave Iran.
#JCPOA didn’t stop all paths for #Iran to develop nuclear weapons, contrary to the way it was sold to the American people.
What @JohnKerry has done by engaging with #Iran’s regime, the world’s top state sponsor of terror, is unseemly, unprecedented, and inconsistent with U.S. foreign policy. The deal failed. Let it go.
Susan and I are keeping our fellow Americans affected by #Florence in our prayers. We encourage everyone to take the right steps to stay safe.  We watch the work of our first responders with great pride. Thank you for your dedication and selflessness.
One of the best parts of my job is welcoming the newest members of @StateDept team! Congratulations to the members of the 156th Civil Service class. I know you’ll serve our country with pride, honor, and distinction. https://t.co/w2rhKi6PHs
.@POTUS’ Executive Order made clear the U.S. won’t tolerate foreign interference in our democratic processes. Preserving the integrity of our elections is a matter of protecting sovereignty and national security. Any interference will be met with swift and painful consequences.

If only the Ayatollah’s regime didn’t ban social media in #Iran, maybe the Iranian people would know the truth about who really cares about Palestinians, and why the regime wastes the people’s money on terrorists while they struggle.
FACT: #Iran’s regime punished Palestinians by providing them just $20,000 — yes, $20,000 — via #UNWRA from 2008 to 2017.
Ayatollah Khamenei says he cares about Palestinians.	 	FACT: Since 1994, the U.S. provided $6.3 billion in aid to support the Palestinian people; #Iran’s morally corrupt regime provided hundreds of millions in aid to terrorists who endanger the Palestinians’ lives &amp; livelihoods. https://t.co/GCP8IjFdFt

Deeply concerned about reports of #Iran transferring ballistic missiles into Iraq. If true, this would be a gross violation of Iraqi sovereignty and of UNSCR 2231. Baghdad should determine what happens in Iraq, not Tehran.
Just spoke with @brett_mcgurk who’s on the ground in #Baghdad representing me and @POTUS. Doing a great job. Forming a strong Iraqi government on national basis is essential to the enduring defeat of #ISIS.
Our relationship with Guatemala is important. We greatly appreciate Guatemala's efforts in counternarcotics and security.
The 3 million Syrians, who have already been forced out of their homes and are now in #Idlib, will suffer from this aggression. Not good. The world is watching.
Sergey Lavrov is defending Syrian and Russian assault on #Idlib. The Russians and Assad agreed not to permit this. The U.S sees this as an escalation of an already dangerous conflict.
Excited to swear in Amb. David Hale as the Under Secretary for Political Affairs @StateDept. He’s a career Foreign Service Officer who’ll work closely with our regional bureaus to deliver maximum diplomatic impact. I look forward to working with David to execute @POTUS’ agenda. https://t.co/G5eL5t5dup

Countering the #Iran regime’s malign activity is a key @POTUS foreign policy priority. The Iran Action Group, led by Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook, will ensure a coordinated, unified approach to address the regime's hostile activity and support the Iranian people.
I spoke with Foreign Minister Kang about the Inter-Korean talks held on Monday. The U.S. and the #ROK remain in close cooperation to ensure the final, fully verified denuclearization of the #DPRK. We believe progress can be made.

Today, the regime in #Iran is at odds with world peace. We urge our allies and partners to join the U.S. and deny Iran’s leadership the funds to oppress the Iranian people and to foment terrorism around the world.

RT @StateDept: .@SecPompeo spoke to @Kania_MetroTV as he concluded his #IndoPacific trip in #Indonesia. Check out the full interview here:…
90 days ago, @POTUS withdrew U.S. from the failed #IranDeal. Today, sanctions on the regime in #Iran were re-imposed to counter its malign activities. The regime must use Iran's resources to help its citizens, not support terror &amp; enrich the leadership. https://t.co/hES0cmwjYc
We are deeply concerned about reports of Iranian regime’s violence against unarmed citizens. U.S. supports Iranian people’s right to protest against the regime’s corruption &amp; oppression without fear of reprisal. We call on the regime in #Iran to respect its people’s human rights.
This morning, I departed #Indonesia after having met with @jokowi @kemlu_r - I’d like to express my deepest sympathies to all affected by the Aug 5 earthquake in Indonesia’s NTB province, again impacting Lombok &amp; neighboring Bali.

It’s not a pipe dream to ask the #Iranian leadership to behave like a normal, responsible country.  Our asks are simple.
Great to stand by my friend #GinaHaspel – our new @CIA Director! I look forward to your leadership as your team continues to defend American interests around the globe. https://t.co/ovy7VwS5dZ
After our withdrawal from #JCPOA, @POTUS asked me to achieve his goals on #Iran: 1. Apply the strongest possible financial pressure; 2. Deter any Iranian aggression; 3. Advocate for Iranian people; 4. Seek bold new steps with not only our allies &amp; partners, but with Iran as well.
#JCPOA has not ended Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Nor did it deter its quest for regional hegemony. #Iran’s leaders saw the deal as a starting gun to storm across the region.
As I said at @Heritage: #Iran must be denied a nuclear weapon &amp; ballistic missiles. Its aggression must be stopped. #IRGC's access to resources must be disrupted. U.S. will work with our allies to find a lasting solution to Iran's malign activities.
#Iran could have used the money from #JCPOA to boost the economic fortunes of a struggling people. Instead the regime spent it fueling proxy wars &amp; lining the pockets of #IRGC, #Hizballah &amp; #Hamas. Iran advanced its march across the Middle East during JCPOA.
We ask the Iranian people: do you want your country to be known as a co-conspirator with #Hizballah, #Hamas, #Taliban, and #alQaeda? The United States says you deserve better.
.@POTUS withdrew from #JCPOA for a simple reason: it failed to guarantee the safety of the American people from the risks created by #Iran’s leaders.
Bernard Lewis was a true scholar &amp; great man. I owe a great deal of my understanding of the Middle East to his work. He was a man who believed, as I do, that Americans must be more confident in the greatness of our country, not less. Thank you, Mr. Lewis for your life of service
Watching #Venezuela today.  Sham elections change nothing.  We need Venezuelan people running this country...a nation with so much to offer the world. We call on the government to free #JoshHolt
Looking forward to speaking @Heritage on Monday, May 21, about the road ahead on #Iran.
We support the #Iranian people who are demonstrating against an oppressive government.  3 deaths &amp; internet interruption show the regime’s true nature.  @statedept
Congratulations on your confirmation! Way to win, Gina.  #GinaHaspel
It’s a great honor to lead the world’s finest diplomatic corps. Today, I spoke with many of the patriots at the @StateDept and addressed our mission to put the interests of the American people first and promote peace, prosperity, and security. https://t.co/58Rls59KMp
I’m pleased to announce that I’m lifting @StateDept hiring freeze on Foreign Service and Civil Service employees. We need our men and women on the ground executing American diplomacy and representing our great nation.
Last December, @POTUS acknowledged Israel’s capital is Jerusalem. He directed @StateDept to move our embassy to Jerusalem as recognition of that reality. I'm incredibly proud that today, on Israel's 70th anniversary of independence, #USEmbassyJerusalem is open.
On Sunday shows I discussed withdrawal from JCPOA: To suggest that’s driving Iranian conduct in Yemen, the rise of Hezbollah—those took place during JCPOA...they felt like they could act with impunity. While this agreement was in place Iran continued its march across Middle East.
Enjoyed my discussion with @margbrennan on @FaceTheNation. In days and weeks ahead, we’ll work with E3 to construct a deal that accounts for all of #Iran’s malign behavior.
Thanks, @FoxNewsSunday Chris Wallace, for a productive conversation about #DPRK and the path to denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. We won’t repeat the mistakes of the past as we look ahead to the @POTUS meeting on June 12 in Singapore.
Our prayers are with the people of France following last night’s attack in Paris. The U.S. stands with our ally against terror. #FriendsPartnersAllies
Delighted to meet @cafreeland today. Our relationship with #Canada is one of the closest and most extensive in the world. I appreciate Canada’s #LimaGroup efforts to support the people of #Venezuela, and opposition to #DPRK’s illegal #nuclear program. #FriendsPartnersAllies https://t.co/mLfGpJH5wX
Productive meeting with Kang Kyung-wha of @MOFAkr_eng today to discuss #NorthKorea and @POTUS’s commitment to the complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. https://t.co/NhFOUFDiEq
I had the chance to watch Acting CIA Director Gina Haspel testify. I’m looking forward to receiving intelligence as Secretary of State from this amazing leader. Win Gina!
I had productive meetings in Pyongyang with Chairman Kim Jong-un and made progress. I'm delighted to bring home three Americans.
Headed back to #DPRK at the invitation of the North Korean leadership. I look forward to planning a successful summit between President Trump and Kim Jong-un.
Effective, forward-thinking diplomacy increases our chances of solving problems peacefully. Our foreign policy must be pragmatic and principled, agile enough to respond to changing circumstances but anchored in the ideals and values that ground the United States and our allies. https://t.co/X4Q3rBfnym
On Foreign Affairs Day, I join @AFSAtweets in celebrating the men and women of @StateDept and @USAID. I am grateful for your service to our country and the many sacrifices you and your families have made along the way. https://t.co/xYnxZM7oKD
We have an unprecedented opportunity to change the course of history on the Korean Peninsula, but the outcome is unknown. However, one thing is certain: the Trump administration will not repeat the mistakes of the past. Our eyes are wide open and a bad deal is not an option.
Humbled by @VP's kind words and grateful for his leadership. Together my @StateDept team will execute our mission for the American people. https://t.co/fLbTxxg1ny
Honored to be joined by @POTUS and @VP for my swearing-in at the @StateDept today. Ready to lead America's diplomats to deliver for our President and our country. https://t.co/sgLHF0hDsv
Thank you, President Trump. I'm deeply humbled to serve as our nation's chief diplomat on behalf of the American people. https://t.co/Uh0OvR2O00
Thrilled to accompany @POTUS as he presented the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy to my alma mater @WestPoint_USMA and the @ArmyWP_Football Black Knights. #GoArmy! https://t.co/oi4JLzDz1G
Thank you to Deputy Secretary of @StateDept John Sullivan for leading our diplomatic efforts over the last few weeks. He is a true patriot, leader, and public servant. https://t.co/K68u7g8obL
I'm grateful to @POTUS for the honor to serve as our nation's 70th Secretary of State. So many matters of global importance demand our focus. I'm committed to putting the interests of the American people first and look forward to serving with the world's finest diplomatic corps. https://t.co/qEWQ6oa3Rm
