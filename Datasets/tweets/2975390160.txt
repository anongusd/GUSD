@AOC Socialism: Is that like the state by way of legislation providing inkind or financial exchange via legislation?
Our products and technology could advance more quickly if people had access to resources.  Oh and there is enough for everyone.  Our grandchildren and anyone we come across will not trust us in commerce because of the favor shown for the extreme few against most all of the many
Redo 7. You paid elected officials over production, consumption and diposal to not pay for needs of people in every market for you to have higher number on computer screens essentially.  We have people who want to build and trade good products and services.
And also the eminities that you have enjoyed have largely been tax free. 3. The third reason to pay humans to be humans is the market that you enjoy could float the consumption for everyone.  You don't have to own everything.  You work less than a guy doing labor.
Yes humans should be paid to be human because as you have agreed to provide for yourselves to be able to sleep inside, to eat, to have a way for good education and for good health care, U have paid to both not pay taxes and increase the healthcare industry in some good &amp; bad ways
You have paid elected officials someway for years for them to vote against certain products. And that's unlawful no matter how much you've been paid to make it legal.
7. You break the Constitution to legislate the market against you typically intentionally obsolescent product and talk us into selling it to each other for a brand sown on for pay that you wouldn't enjoy being paid yourself
5. The revenues of your production that we do and consume do not leave us with 1% of the whole market.  6. That means it is literally not a trade medium for the 99% of us that you have convinced to do your work to pay you for us doing it. &amp; We struggle to have anything below min
Should humans be paid to be humans.  Open Tweet letter as to why. Please share and add: 1. There are too many people to be employed for 8 hour days . 2. You must over value your products so that people do without. 3. You have more than you can know to spend 4.Jesus said be nice.

@JWKieres @Marina_Sirtis All I was saying was Marina is Beautiful, I don't even know about her politics... I do know almost no one agrees with mine... I wasn't even addressing that.  I used to watch Star Trek and happen to think Marina is Beautiful, don't You?
@JWKieres @Marina_Sirtis No I just think she's Beautiful.   Uhm. Op politics is throwed, the most wealthy do what they do and inform us of how we will remember it, perhaps history will document it but we will look ignorant to the mostly the financial motivations of "world" events.. isn't that ironic?...
@realSi_jeff @Marina_Sirtis On Behalf of the rest of the world, I just wanted to thank You for gracing me and the rest of twitter and other social medias with the beauty of your photo.  You really should consider modeling or something where the world can be blessed by your glossy exterior
@realSi_jeff @Marina_Sirtis ThankYou for sharing Jeff. *Hugs* ;)
@realSi_jeff @Marina_Sirtis Btw Jes for the record... No I Am single uhm available if anyone wanted to drop a line and maybe make friends first, get know each other a lil bit.

@JWKieres @Marina_Sirtis Oh, yeah and he's still not impeached..  he had the Embassy moved to Jerusalem yesterday.  I didn't say anything about politics at all.
@realSi_jeff @Marina_Sirtis Are You sure she is giving You enough Hugs... it doesn't make you less of a man to hug another man.  Is this a daddy thing?
@realSi_jeff @Marina_Sirtis ... Oh I was just complimenting someone that had .... I mean did what I say have something to do with you or was there a break with your girlfriend's hug, like I don't understand why it is you needed tose attention from me today...
@realSi_jeff @Marina_Sirtis Also you have to have a girlfriend for a hug. Geees.   I'm so envious of how pretty a man you are as we can all see from your very natural lol photo.  I'm really just grateful that you could pull yourself away from your girlfriend's hugging long enough to grace my uhm ...
