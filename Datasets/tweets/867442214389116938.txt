@legalwritingpro What is this from??
@Yascha_Mounk The courts aren’t being deferential to Trump per se. They’re being deferential to the presidency. That’s not a meaningless distinction. Judges know these decisions will affect the powers of future presidents as well.
@tphbeamish @pnjaban @RepLipinski Who’s the other?
@ZoeTillman Which judges worked on which campaigns?
@RMFifthCircuit What client pays for this sort of lawyering??
@McCormickProf Most likely D, but occasionally C will be justified.
@jadler1969 Can you provide links to what you’re referring to in MA &amp; NJ?
@_JD_JD_ Searching for utility in Bluebook rules sounds like a fool’s errand.
@espinsegall @Greg651 @jadler1969 “Mississippi’s treatment of women” isn’t at issue. The constitutionality of a single law is. 		Suppose NY passes a gun control law. Should a court look to NY’s general hostility toward gun ownership? No. Just the law in issue.
@OrinKerr You might be interested to learn that there are other forms of “white affirmative action” besides legacy admissions. I went to the Univ of Wisc and benefited from preference for “rural” students b/c (supposedly) otherwise the school would be all suburbanites.
@xan_desanctis Christopher Hitchens.

@6thCirBlog Who dissented? Link?
@xan_desanctis @instapundit Also George Takei
@PreetBharara Jamie Gorelick.
@legalwritingpro Cut “the case of”.

@RMFifthCircuit There’s a pretty colossal difference between not “having the profits” and equity partners simply being unwilling to part with them. The high-profit firms that’ll quickly match don’t even need to discuss “affordability”—just whether they think they’ll get a positive ROI.
@mjs_DC @Slate Is there ever a 5-4 conservative decision that you don’t describe as cataclysmic? Notice that the world is still turning. I bet treating every lost battle like a full-blown Waterloo demoralizes your liberal readership. Constructive? Doubtful.
@BadgerEye @jimsteineke @joshdukelow @judgedallet A Republican public official offers a polite, congratulatory message across the ideological aisle. 		Progressive “journalist” responds with a snide, cocky prediction, as if displaying contempt is some sort of virtue.		Tragic.
@jamalgreene @thehill Would you dare to publicly compare a female politician’s appearance to that of one of history’s villains?
@SCOTUSPlaces Kelly*
@SethAMandel It was Mattis and Kelly, per AP reporting. No indication McMaster was involved, but certainly plausible.
