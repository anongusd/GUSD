@CriticalRole @matthewmercer @WillingBlam @Marisha_Ray @TitmouseInc If my small voice can represent what this means to all of us critters much of my distraction today was due to my weekly D&amp;D game where in a break from our regular game, I am play testing a module for the #taldorei setting. Honored to DM in this world. @matthewmercer thank you.
Oh, one more thing: @CNN @MSNBC @FoxNews, @CNBC has the lead. Finally put out some good news.
Finally, is it Thursday yet? @BrianWFoster "Stay Turnt"!
Who gave kids a chance to become someone else whether it be therapy, catharsis, or just good old social storytelling and fun. We see you. #critters, I see you. Also, vote for me for @DnDBeyond Undersecretary of Shenanigans (its an unballoted position, so write in!) Love you all.
Also, @Wizards_DnD for being the effing lunatics you are, @mattcolville @HighRollersDnD @JeremyECrawford @ChrisPerkinsDnD @sherlock_hulmes @satinephoenix @RutyWoot @jasoncmiller @AnemoneTea @willfriedle @MaryEMcGlynn @kharypayton and everyone else.
In honor of @CriticalRole and #critters everywhere, I would like to send a big thank you to @GeekandSundry, @feliciaday, and @JoinTeamAlpha for giving CR the exposure it has had to touch so many lives this deeply.  @JoeManganiello for bringing d&amp;d mainstream and keeping it there.
@TessFowler Tess, I cant imagine the pain and difficulty you are experiencing. Platitudes like "im sorry for your loss" are kind and well meant, but just that, platitudes. I lost my dad at age 9 years old, 23 years ago. I cant relate to your experience, but if you ever need to vent, Im here.
@realDonaldTrump Which would be?
@MaryEMcGlynn Also, I tweeted you because I 1. Love you. 2. Im sure CR Prime is getting literally innundated and I just want to let them enjoy.
@MaryEMcGlynn I will totally voice a background character for free!
@lenoreriegel Please pass my congrata to the team, unfortunately the cost of running my grassroots campaign to become Undersecretary of Shenanigans to the officially unofficial @DnDBeyond team limited my fungible assets (as has all my CR t-shirts) so I couldnt contribute here. Vote for me!
@WillingBlam @StephenAtHome @StephenAtHome is definitely one of Calebs former classmates. Goldblum on the other hand is certainly Cadeuceus's father.
@showupforthis Michael Jordan
@jaarmstr @KSBOEN1 @senatemajldr And 99.99999999% (or whatever other crazy and factually false figure you presented) of abortions take place long before a fetus is independently viable outside the womb. Pass on by, your commentary is useless.
@jaarmstr @KSBOEN1 @senatemajldr Way to make a straw man argument. I didnt suggest that at all, but keep trying :)
@News2State Im not trying to legislate control over someone else.
@KSBOEN1 @senatemajldr Frankenstein* (typo)
@KSBOEN1 @senatemajldr Good luck chasing your frankenstine, sincerely. He, like born alive abortions is a work of fiction so youll be hard pressed to argue the morality of something that isnt even a real thing. Also, if it were, your advocating for the deaths of mothers to preserve infants. Whos sick?
@KSBOEN1 @senatemajldr Ive genuinely remained respectful however I will leave you with this before my patience of you runs thin. You do not get to define the rights of others, especially if your uninformed about your position. Have fun sharpening your pitchforks and lighting torches.
@KSBOEN1 @senatemajldr Two words: circular reporting. Really not a good idea to post an article as defense which sources the ACLJ, which is the source of this data-spin. Seriously, source your information, you're getting pious over a thing that isnt a thing.
@KSBOEN1 @senatemajldr Its also worth mentioning that the cases of foetal survival are very hard to find any real evidence of.
@KSBOEN1 @senatemajldr https://t.co/Taknxm8COJ
@KSBOEN1 @senatemajldr And just to put the pin in this, consider this article. While Rewire is not a professional medical journal, they do provide direct links to 38 attorneys general responses that "born alive abortions" are just not a thing.
@KSBOEN1 @senatemajldr I respect your position and right to have one. Unfortunately, willful ignorance is not a defense.
@KSBOEN1 Not a communist, but thanks for acting like I have quite the platform. I feel so important now.
@KSBOEN1 @senatemajldr Oh, and your vote failed. So, Im sorry to say Rs again dont get to decide whose life is worth preserving.
@KSBOEN1 @senatemajldr You want to stop abortion? Make reproductive health education and contraceptives universally available and funded. The "abortion crisis" is an abstract assault on the poor.
@KSBOEN1 @senatemajldr Seriously, where do you get this propaganda? Do you even know what abortion entails? And also, for the record, most states do not have a late-term abortion legal through the 9th month. Seriously if your gonna have a position, do the research. And spin machines dont count.
@KSBOEN1 @senatemajldr You may have forgotten, abortion is legal. And a choice. You dont support it? Great. No abortions for you. I hope you never have to make that choice. That doesnt permit you to legislate the right of others to make that choice. Roe v. Wade has survived for this very reason.
@KSBOEN1 @senatemajldr You watch too much fictional drama tv.
@KRenner2 @KSBOEN1 @senatemajldr Its a poor sample and the "data" available is collected by partisan research firms infamous for selectively spinning data.
@KSBOEN1 @senatemajldr Id also presume that youre against assisted suicide, therefore forcing the terminally infirm to stick around and suffer because "murder is wrong". Thats a useless platitude and also why there is a legal standard for what constitutes murder.
@KSBOEN1 @senatemajldr "Murder" for the preservation of life... funny how quickly you determine who gets to live. Do you also sue for peace in any military conflict? Do you support the death penalty? Do you eat meat? Its funny where the R line keeps shiftong on what "murder" is.
@KSBOEN1 @senatemajldr For the record "botched abortion" is a politically expedient spin by reps. Available data is poor, but fewer than 4 fetuses survive abortion annually. Overwhelming majority of those do not survive to term. Any "born alive" have complications that kill most within the first year.
@KSBOEN1 @senatemajldr It must be nice to sit on your high horse with high-minded idealism insulated from the unfortunate but factual cruelties of the real world. You want to play fantasy? Take up a D&amp;D. Life is hard, and requires shitty decisions. Bravery is not to ignore that because its unpalatable.
@KSBOEN1 @senatemajldr You really need to read the bill.
@KSBOEN1 @senatemajldr Oh, and that it should absolutely not be left to the Mitch McConnells of the world to make that decision unilaterally.
@KSBOEN1 @senatemajldr When it is in crisis where life is sustainable with zero longevity expected, or where the live birth would compromise the life of the mother, the decision is easy. I dont want to let an infant die nor kill one. I am saying that unfortunate circumstances exist where its necessary.
@senatemajldr Except its real easy to monday-morning quarterback a decision which never has and never will effect you, and to make general platitudes about your position as if they are generally accepted norms and mores (hint: theyre not). Shove it, Mitch.
@CecilBaldwinIII Just transferred with the navy from nola to Key West. Saw nightvale there last year, so... all hail. Also go check out the boondock saint on St Pete. That was my home in the wall, theyll treat you right.
@lenoreriegel Oh, you... 🤗
@lenoreriegel Oh, the word is "butter"
@ArseQueef @DnDBeyond @VoiceOfOBrien @samriegel I am running for Undersecretary of Shenaningans. We have big proposals to expand our current efforts in tom foolery and are looking to branch out into the community with a bamboozle outreach program. We fall under the Department of Whimsy. Mike DnD Beyond Great, vote for me.
@lenoreriegel Spread the word.
@lenoreriegel I say Mike DnD Beyond Great Again, as I am running for undersecretary of shenanigans. Bamboozles will also be considered under my administration. You can find the undersecretary role in the department of whimsy.
@VoiceOfOBrien @sherlock_hulmes Id like to run for undersecretary of shenanigans.
@EarthbreakGroon @DothTheDoth https://t.co/kJmyra96fW
@EarthbreakGroon @DothTheDoth Groon,? Is this... is this you?
@CriticalRole Found in the CR breakroom, it translates as: "it was me. - Max"
@realDonaldTrump Why call to verify when the response is inevitably a smoke screen?
@Itsygo5 @8BitWhitt @TaldoreiDay Ill let you know, thanks!
@DeborahAnnWoll @Xanderrific My name is Mike	I was born to be a good guy 	My age is not the only thing missing 	I like to think I lost a bet
@TaldoreiDay Truly too kind
*love and respect*
@fluffyguy Fluffy, just want to say that I just saw your new special and I live and respect your work. Also, I dont give a f$*k who you are, you always have a spot at my D&amp;D table.
@ChrisPerkinsDnD I just want to know how long it took to compose a tweet with all of those special characters
@16BitEric @EarthbreakGroon Back in high school, we had a cluster suicide. On the heels of the unfortunate death of a student in a car accident, over the next 6 weeks we lost 2 students and a regular substitute teacher, whom I knew fairly well. Over the next months I escorted 2 students to seek counseling.
@CecilBaldwinIII Because the Television requires power, thus "on", while something written "in" a book requires it to be open.
@TaldoreiDay new in the Key West area, hoping to maybe jump into a game with some critters. Help a guy out?
@PatrickRothfuss Alas, my desire to be a little spoon shall go unrequited another year.
@sherlock_hulmes I was NASTY at blitzball. So much so, that for a short time I had genuinely forgotten there was another game.
@TitusNation I echo his reply.
@NathanFillion Im consistently employed on salary with job security and no criminal record.
@realDonaldTrump Not a single word of that poll said "wall"
Feature... that was the word i was searching for... a feature.
An hour segment with clips from a game with crazy original characters, glimpses into different DMs worlds or interpretations, and a little about facilities that visitors can explore. Something good for the local fans and the people in search or transit.
Instead of Man vs Food, Ill do B&amp;B D&amp;D.
Or maybe have @Maxxjenga and @ItsDaniCarr  play in a local's game. Just anything to expand the brand and show that outside of our CR mainlining there are places to do this. @Marisha_Ray when the navy no longer has use for me, id do a show illuminating local shops and games.
@CriticalRole the nerd-dom is strong. If CR is planning a charity game with @ExtraLife4Kids or other, maybe also do an exposition of local nerd havens, hit up @BadWolfBar. Rep the CR brand and the community where the community can play, and outside LA. I vouch. Ill play.
@willfriedle @scottEweinberg Risky business, pretty woman
@MiniMatato @matthewmercer @matthewmercer definitely has a point with LE being more powerful than the party. I would also take them into a scenario where delicacy is important. That can be a dungeon with no enemies, but traps and secrets and puzzles, or it can be a stealth-essential object recovery.
@realDonaldTrump I wish you would listen. The wall is not equivalent to border security. You can support one without the other. Ignoring those whom it is politically expedient to attack... I challenge you to present a border security plan without a wall. Just conceive of one. It is possible.
@kylekinane Depends what you mean by sideways. Options include Travelers season 3, Jane the Virgin season 2, not 3, and Event Horizon.
The Rookie, is one of the most genuine shows I have ever seen, albeit some creative license and some discounted procedures. Sirens was as close to any real representation of EMS as seen, but no show sees 45 min of cpr or triage at a MCI or a head on mva in the snow.
Movies alone is disingenuous.  TV is the source of my question tonight. Even shows that do it well, CPR doesnt last a half a minute. A flat line is not a shockable ryhthym. Its no mystery that EMS is characterized as ambulance drivers. They do so much more in real life.
@jonfavs @ThatKevinSmith apologies for tweeting you both specifically, but I have a question and Im a fan and follower of your director credits. I know cinematically you cant dedicate time to death, but why does everyone die instantly in movies. EMT 12 years. That takes time.
@PatrickRothfuss Entirely unrelated. Ive begun, and am about a third through an audio book of "the name of the wind". If nothing else, your approach and the majesty, or functional lack thereof, in describing magick is restorative and a fresh perspective. Im enjoying this greatly.
@matthewmercer @realDonaldTrump Someday, when this is over, if you ever want to join me in a beverage and tears of rage and celebration, and want to know what Ive thought about all of this, from a unique perspective, the drinks will be on me. Bring tissues.
@matthewmercer This is scarily similar (though more detailed) than my style of prep. I create a latticework and often have to improvise as my players always want to talk to someone I havent built. And is not remotely connected to anyone I have.
@realDonaldTrump Maybe improve access and efficiency in support of the VA
@Jim_Jordan @AdamSchiff Seriously, way to put the cart before the horse. There is no standard that requires disclosure of his meeting, nor is there any standard that prohibits him from meeting with someone so flimsily connected, though you push a gravitas that just isnt there.
@BadWolfBar How is chewbacchus so early?
RT @SageFrancis: RT the @EpicBeardMen tweet if you would like to be personally messaged when all #ComeToTheSandDunes tour dates and tickets…
@michaelshermer Agreed, even by the recording, the "black bastard" comment used a qualifier of the rapist &amp; Neeson's likely target. Neeson was clearly seeking vengance against whomever might have been the rapist, in this case, black. The target was because of the rape, not because he was black.
@SenatorLankford @ChrisCoons Go pray, then let me know how successful that is. Get back to work.
@WhiteHouse Another meaningless statistic. There a presently more people living in the US than ever before in history by virtue of population expansion, or would he like to claim credit for that too?
@senatemajldr So stop obstructing? Youre the one who refuses to put bills to a vote. Your idea of compromise is an ultimatum. Get with the program, Mitch.
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump These are meaningless statistics which only show that the public polled approved of his words, words which had already been focus tested.
@TheProverbtv @RepLaHood @realDonaldTrump It was added in 1954 and the provision was considered broad enough to cover christians and jews with no consideration for other interpretations of god and under the principle that athiesm was inconsistent with being American. It was added to marginalize who is American.
@RepRichHudson @realDonaldTrump Rely less on "god", maybe youll get something done.
@RepBobGibbs Its not resistance. They wont tolerate holding 800,000 american federal government workers hostage
@RepLaHood @realDonaldTrump Until the 1950s, it was one nation indivisible. The addition of "god" was a way to characterize non christians as heathens.
@Emma4Change @Hectorisfunny They give a shit only when they arent born.
@ddale8 I wonder if he considers the unborn not free by this hypocrisy...
@Kimball1Kelly @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump What of anything Ive said gives you any indication either that in some way "i lost", that I wear pink panties (which life is too short to wear boring panties, mine have cartoons on them), or that I am a cry baby in any way? I disagree with your blind faith therefore Im ignorant?
@RepLaHood @realDonaldTrump Read your fact-checks.
@RepLaHood @realDonaldTrump Horseshit. Unborn are not viable. Get your meddling out of women's uteruses.
@Kimball1Kelly @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump By Ivanka. Drink your kool aid, "chump".
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Thats an Ivanka agenda. Trump neither campaigned on it nor has had any interest in it until tonight. Its been a periodic disappearing blurb when he needs to cultivate support.
@CongPalazzo You genuinely have no concept of what these people are leaving or what they are being told. Walls dont work. Didnt stop the huns or the mongols. Didnt protect babylon or macedonia.
@Jim_Jordan @POTUS Oh, and Ill put a bunch of cartel enforcers in with you.
@Jim_Jordan @POTUS Tell you what, Ill build a wall free of cost 30' high around your house. Entirely occlusive. Tell me you wont find a way through.
@RodneyDavis Also, more people live in this country presently than at any other time in history. A meaningless argument.
@Jim_Jordan @POTUS Youre as bad as McConnell. I cant tell where either of you end and POTUS begins. I cant wait to find out the skeletons in your closet.
@Marisha_Ray We rented a beach house for a week and had only immediate family and a couple close friends. Without ever being asked, everyone took a kitchen shift and made food for everyone. We did the arrival night tapas and a bougie taco bar on the wedding night.
@AP Ladies and gentlemen, the US has just been put on notice.
@TheVulcanSalute Like a boss... rather - Monstah!
@ChrisPerkinsDnD I want them to have the best things: helm of unyielding vigilance - attuned, very rare, wearer (wr) can cast alarm 1/day w/o using spell slot. During a short/long rest, 4 ethereal copies of the bearer take directed positions and act with the wr's melee when detecting a threat.
@ChrisPerkinsDnD I'm literally paid to keep Secrets, you know... just in case the heat gets heavy. #burdensharing
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump He also clearly has no visibility on the social revolution taking place there. A mostly peaceful social revolution.
@washingtonpost Republicans have always advocated against equal opportunity in voting. The poor and disenfranchised are able to be kept under control by white, wealthy, old men through this, gerrymandering and other voter suppression techniques.
@realDonaldTrump What if they contemplate it but decide that you are emphatically wrong? Also, maybe listen to your intelligence officials. They know more than you do.
@Jim_Jordan Do the youth, whom will be affected most by the legislation you pass, have no capacity to influence their governance? You ignorant, racist shit heel? Also, yeah I suppose bible classes in public schools support your agenda like jesus riding the dinosaurs 6000 years ago does. Shmo
@realDonaldTrump This is the single dumbest position you take. Weather and climate are different things and the warming of the global temperature and melting of the ice caps results in extreme conditions in temperature.
@donttrythis Brake cleaner makes a lot.
@altNOAA According to Barney and James Stinson, Season 2, Episode 10, 2006, high fives were apparently back. Not sure if they went away again. Per Community, Season 5, Episode 5, 2014, Buzz Hickey introduced an odd fist bump-knock-low five but that didnt catch on.
@dannypudi with the success of @donaldglover's Childish Gambino presentation of "This is America", I do believe that Troy will in fact stumble upon Dance Pants, if they happen to be grey linen like the video, I look like his albino counterpart.
@CriticalRole we critters have talked about the aftermath. I'm sad I have not met them yet, but it is perhaps for the better. I know of both what Scanlan did last summer, and of Grog's skeletons in Dalen's Closet. https://t.co/6bDe6ldOIX
@michiokaku Busy fighting about the rights of women and brown people...
@MoneyGram I get it, but this is becoming a problem. The nearest place for me to receive it is 3 hours away.
@MoneyGram you should put a notice on your website that of you're trying to receive money in key west, good luck. No participating location can dispense your $2,500 cap.
@DavidBrodyCBN @rockrichard @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Funny for a guy who cant read a teleprompter to be playing chess. "We have the lowest employment, the best employment".
@chrislhayes Now I hope no Ds attend
@VP @trish_regan @POTUS You cannot make clear that which facts do not support. The humanitarian crisis is not one on our border, but that of one within the borders of our neighbors and trading parnters. The only crisis on the border is one you folks have created. How many children? Reunite the families.
@FOX8NOLA Thanks for your stilted and racist coverage. It would be wise to convey the message in context about the owners rather than quoting them directly. Facility with language is a problem not just enjoyed by people who speak english second, but also the entire Fox family.
@SpeakerPelosi offer to consent to the absurd 5.7 billion on the provision that no additional funding will ever be appropriated to the wall. Let him figure out how to build his wall across 1700 miles of inconsistent terrain for that. He might get a picket fence.
@Jim_Jordan @SpeakerPelosi That is by far, the single best, most responsible way to help the country.
@Jim_Jordan If someone was thoughtless and had power, armed with an extreme and bigoted agenda, would you find that dangerous? What would your response be, assuming you had the ability to intervene?
@realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow You're no longer a private citizen. Your opinion on this is not something the Office of the President should be concerned with.
@michiokaku Eventually, in silence.
@Marisha_Ray @EspionageBeauty I'm sure it's been asked, but will the live show be on the CR twitch later?
@TessFowler Mine is well, this one.
@SocialismW @GOPLeader There are literally no facts and figures that back those numbers.
@SocialismW @GOPLeader You can increase border security without a wall. It makes no sense to piss away taxpayer money on an ego project over infrastructure or climate change or any other pressing actual crises.
@SocialismW @GOPLeader You're assuming my bias. Whoever brought up a wall would be stupid. I oppose it because it wont work and will be a waste of billions of dollars.
@SocialismW @GOPLeader The solution to border security is not something which could be defeated by a 31' ladder.
@SocialismW @GOPLeader For 4.50 a month we could make sure that every vet isn't homeless and that no children go hungry. Seems like your priority is in the wrong place. Also, experts have assessed that the costs associated to the actual construction in addition to the ecological impact are far higher.
@GOPLeader That's disingenuous and you know it.
Simple point here. If @realDonaldTrump loses support of @LindseyGrahamSC and @DRUDGE_REPORT turns on him, the typical conveyances of his message to his base will be lost. He loses his base and there is no chance of reelection.
@paulatcvs @GOPLeader Except that's not true. 92% of asylum seekers make their court dates and follow the process.
@paulatcvs @GOPLeader First, asylum seekers are in the country LEGALLY.
@paulatcvs @GOPLeader https://t.co/EdDWSqDO1Y For starters. Then look at the CBP and Center for Migration Studies reporting which support each other that between 1982 and 1996 an estimated 10 million illegal immigrants were living in the country.
@paulatcvs @GOPLeader CBP reporting indicates that between 1996 and 2012 the average number of people living in the US illegally grew annually reaching its peak in '12 at around 470,000 people which has steadily declined annually to date, a 20 year low.
@paulatcvs @GOPLeader Additional reporting states that over 80 percent of all illegals living in the US have been here for more than a decade with only about 6 percent arriving over the last 5 years.
@paulatcvs @GOPLeader Thread. The reduction of illegal persons entering from 470,000 in 2012 to about 70,000 in 2017 represents a reduction of about 85%. Given a single standard deviation to account for reporting errors, it reduces to about a 78% declination in illegal immigrant inflation since 1989
@NightValeRadio That's the digital "skip the light fandango" right?
@DrHubbert @realDonaldTrump But again, the wall neither being practical or practicable still does nothing more to approach the causes of this refugee exodus. We need to look at them with the compassion that should be landed to any person desperate for aid and not characterize them as invading demons.
@DrHubbert @realDonaldTrump Also, that argument is easily defeated by two ladders. The larger point is the expense and development so far only assessed by contractors and not engineers is unlikely to ever successfully complete construction and at an exorbitant cost. The bill will be far higher than 5.7B.
@DrHubbert @realDonaldTrump There are already sensors and border patrol. Despite what you may have been led to believe, they arent crossing between ports of entry in throngs. The system is predicated on all resources looking in the right place at the right time &amp; being within reach. A wall doesnt fix that.
@DrHubbert @realDonaldTrump The Manchurians, defectors from East Berlin... I could go on. A wall only works is if there is an active military presence enforcing the wall. That's not the place for a modern democracy. That's the place for autocracies &amp; dictatorships. Not for a country built on freedom.
@DrHubbert @realDonaldTrump Really? Didnt stop the huns or mongols. Babylon fell, Macedonia fell. Walls have their utility, but if theyre manned as the case with prisons. We can just glide right past your zoo analogy as the animals cant build fences or dynamite. You dont seem to have facility with history
@RayBrow71543927 @Jim_Jordan My position is not radical. It is and has been for the humane treatment of all peoples and the equal distribution and protection of rights. Furthermore, a wall is just a paper tiger meant to signal brown people they arent welcome &amp; does nothing to solve the cause of their exodus.
@RayBrow71543927 @Jim_Jordan It's not a race card. It's about the complicit enabling of bigotry, regressive policies restricting rights of the many in favor of the advantaged, and the disproportionate representation and treatment of the marginalized. You can call it a race card, but that's the GOP.
@RayBrow71543927 @Jim_Jordan Seems to me like this new version of Republican are the snowflakes. Old, rich, white, dudes are looking for safe spaces to practice their bigotry while losing more and power to women, people of color, basically anyone who isn't them. They should be scared. Their reign is over.
@RepDaveJoyce @POTUS They passed 2 clean spending Bill's. Your Maj Leader cant get his head out of Trump's ass.
@DrHubbert @realDonaldTrump A wall wont do shit to fix either.
@DrHubbert @realDonaldTrump Except you think a 2-3k mile journey on foot isn't already a deterrent? They're coming here for 2 principle reasons. 1 the conditions which they are leaving give them no recourse but to escape &amp; the US is that opportunity. 2 they are misled by traffickers on how they will get in.
@JoseGon31653126 @realDonaldTrump No it isn't. They fire rockets over that wall on a regular basis, moron.
@realDonaldTrump You have yet to explain in any way, in what manner a wall will ameliorate the humanitarian crisis. How does a physical barrier stop the crisis bringing them here? Or alleviate the risks and dangers of their journey? You think a wall will stop them from trying to escape?
@Jim_Jordan It's only radical if you believe in human decency and moving away from the regressive policies which continue to disenfranchise and further marginalize the population that isn't wealthy, male, and white.
@altNOAA This is a common problem. An excellent Senator crucified on the inappropriate &amp; unintentionally harmful behavior of his past. He was a comedian screwing around in a way the public deemed disqualifying for office. But it's a sliding scale. Society hasn't agreed on a threshold.
@WendyDoodles Goth Blade Academy. I think @executivegoth  would be happy with this.
@SenatorLankford Except a significant portion of the population disagree with you. A fetus is not viable and cannot support life outside the uterus. Old white men have no right to direct what women should do with their bodies.
@CNNSitRoom @Acosta Notice he never asks why McConnell is getting paid... he just turfed clean budget legislation passed by the house preventing a vote in the Senate for the second time. The house needs to ratify a vote of no confidence on the Speaker and force his resignation.
@VP @marklevinshow Yeah. They refuse to be held hostage. Like it or not, there is a crisis at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue complete with a cash-poor paper tiger who buys White House guests fast food. TACKY!
@RepKevinBrady A wall is not the solution and these are refugees, not political masterminds invading with malice aforethought. They need a multinational approach and comprehensive immigration reform focused on compassion not isolationism.
@GOPLeader Illegal immigration in general dropped more than 78% collectively over the last 30 years. There is no direct evidence that supports the drop in illegal immigration was resultant from wall sections at three border cities. Further, there was no increase in cities without a border.
@WhiteHouse How exactly is a wall gonna stop refugees from being raped en route?
@kaitlancollins They dont want leftovers from last night's fast food.
@SethMacFarlane your #family guy writers and EPs were rather prescient with the "cash poor" bit. One cannot help but wonder if, in the absence of white house staff fast food was all he could afford to provide Clemson.
RT @jaketapper: Thread https://t.co/zu8FiDHY9M
@SenatorLankford You're not funding abortions. You're funding womens' right to control their own bodies, you fuck.
@Jim_Jordan Grab a hammer and some plywood get your ass down there and build it on your own dime. #dowhatYOUsaid
@ddale8 Cant wait until he catches wind of the Family Guy episode that just animated his creepiness.
@WSJ @HMDatMI This is incorrect. The standards are changing because out of boot camp the jobs of most of the military do not require, nor afford the opportunity to maintain the standards. The metrics used are increasingly being assessed as a poor evaluation of overall health.
@ItsDaniCarr The best Gambit hands down. I was today old when I found out he was voiced by Chris Potter who played Peter Cain in Kung Fu: The Legend Continues. Loved that show too.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump The overwhelming majority of all drugs coming in to this country enter through our ports and airports, through mail and by other means. Very little comes across the border. Go fund TSA so they can stop the drugs where they actually are. Open the government.
@susie_dent Sounds like Trump's wall.
@realDonaldTrump Or give up on your pointless and wasteful ego project.
@SenRonJohnson Or give up on the ego project which does nothing to resolve the cause or source of the problem.
@Jim_Jordan @RepJerryNadler @POTUS Way to mischaracterize a lot of agency internal administrative procedures, shmuck.
@CriticalRole How long until we find out that Caduceus's father is a direct servitor of the Wildmother in an episode with guest star Jeff Goldblum? https://t.co/ITN4lmjXPh
@realDonaldTrump They're busy governing in their own states... like they're supposed to do in recess. I understand your confusion though. Governing is a yuge word.
This... https://t.co/eErExrTsgT
@jaketapper Yeah, that's not good.
@realDonaldTrump Walls closing in?
@AOC I applaud your youthful and energetic approach to engaging your constituents. You are mature beyond your years. To be accessible to all your constituents, many of whom are not product of the social media revolution requires tact. Your words matter now. Choose them wisely.
@VoiceOfOBrien @Marisha_Ray Todd, we understand you're junior partner of contract underwriting for the regional shipping industry, but Beth really needs a remove curse right now...
@Marisha_Ray I built a halfling bard from the college of glamour. She comes from a good lesser noble home with two supportive parents and is generally bright and cheery. She also kind of makes the party more human and has accidentally become sort of a moral compass
@TessFowler When tess was down in Egypt land...
@RepLaHood Because the Senate isn't serious about getting anything done.

@AOC @TheRevAl Appreciate your moxy. Just remember that in 1991, Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson gave out the address of a white police officer who was involved in a self-defense shooting of a black teen who had a converted .38. Three towns had to take down street signs and there was a race riot.

@Jim_Jordan A snarky comment in private does not constitute "plotting".
@SamanthaSJones4 @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows @seanhannity Maybe you'll learn something
@SamanthaSJones4 @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows @seanhannity Let's make this simple. You can tilt when you should withdraw. Concede to divergent opinion (the cowards path) or present evidence and take me on. You entered thunderdome ignorantly commenting on my response. Bring it.
@SamanthaSJones4 @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows @seanhannity I'll stipulate I am an asshole. That does not improve your position, nor diminish an oppositional position not based on willful ignorance.
@SamanthaSJones4 @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows @seanhannity Yeah we're equally invested. Me with my constitutional obligation and you with your uninformed opinion. If harsh language averts you, perhaps social forums arent your forte.
@SamanthaSJones4 @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows @seanhannity I still know nothing on what basis? Present your evidence or shut the fuck up.
@SamanthaSJones4 @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows @seanhannity Without any irony or insult, I guarantee I know more about all of this than you. Not by choice or as a matter of superiority. By profession I am invested in all of this. To dismiss me as knowing nothing because I disagree with you does nothing but reveal your ignorance.
@SamanthaSJones4 @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows @seanhannity Genuinely, you are drinking the proverbial kool aid. He isn't exposing anything. He is showing dissent on the basis of convenient sound bites and ingrained rhetoric. Its figurative bullshit. No evidence. No facts. He claims facts based on unsupportable premises. Dont be a sheep.
@SamanthaSJones4 @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows @seanhannity I have. Routinely. I'm also what you might call informed. Hes a stooge. And a liar.
@michiokaku I respect you very much, but rarely do you present a scenario that also alludes itself to a humorous end. The stimulus relating to experiencing "heaven" can at least cinematically be achieved with literal bright lights.
@CoryBooker The governments inability to fund itself should be accountable to themselves. They've staffed these workers, they're entitled to payment at the cost of funds obligated to subsidies, infrastructure, elsewhere. The government has money. Passing how to spend it isn't on the workers
@CoryBooker I agree with the sentiment, but then the burden is pushed on to the small businesses that own smaller properties for lease/rent and they deserve to be paid too. Federal workers should continue to get paid regardless if they work excising funding from other obligated funds 1/2

@realDonaldTrump I guess you dont understand what no funding for the wall means. It means no funding for the wall. The problem was never what it was made out of.
@TessFowler The term is "gangplank" which leads from the dock to the "quarterdeck" on larger ships. For ships of the line and other large frigates, the gangplank often crosses from the quarterdeck below the main deck to an elevated platform or mobile stairway on the dock side.
@TessFowler Message me what you're looking for. I've been working on a Tal'Dorei module and NPCs have sort of been the bulk of it.
@TessFowler An old, stained and water ravaged, or is that beer? And charred? Mounted, on the far wall but displayed as it were, faded block of wood equally triumphant as carelessly hung, list of names, some so rotted in the wood that they're barely discernable, for eating the 40 oz. Steak.
@realDonaldTrump @DRUDGE_REPORT Just wait for the recession in may.
@realDonaldTrump What's your plan for southern water crossings?
@realDonaldTrump The problem is drugs and immigration issues are not exclusive to the border. It's a politically expedient and convenient sound bite, but fact is more than 70% of illegal immigration and smuggling comes through our airports. Put your wall around that you smug jerk.

@TitusNation Titus, love and respect. Long time fan, first time tweeter (ish). I am active service. We cannot let POTUS take the country hostage for an ego project. Military funding is fed mandated. We will get our pay... eventually. This is inconvenient and very hard for many, but necessary.
@realDonaldTrump Even the great wall didnt stop Atilla
@charlie_adler Yeah, called the communist manifesto appendix 1: showing dissent to cripplethe American adversary
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Why are dems capitulating to outrageous demands from POTUS? Do not let America be held hostage.
@JerryHerndon11 @realDonaldTrump That is patently untrue.
@realDonaldTrump Um, because ISIS has an end game which results in the deaths of Americans.
@TMK19882 @Jim_Jordan @freedomcaucus It's a wall. No wall is ever unrepeatable. Even the great wall reached its expiration.
@ChrisPerkinsDnD Can I please play the villain?
@tedlieu @POTUS Also, no angst against the persistent military action in Afghanistan, Niger, elsewhere?
@tedlieu @POTUS Perhaps Congress should do more than sanction when adversaries leverage their influence against a vulnerable target... but then again, Russia just took 3 Ukrainian ships and Crimea has been occupied for 4 years so...
@tedlieu @POTUS The only action in Syria has targeted ISIS; in other words, terrorists. Also the executive power to leverage military force short of war is well documented and historically precedent.
@Jim_Jordan @freedomcaucus Yeah, problem is what you said in unsupportable and wasted taxpayer money. Maybe next time pick an issue that isn't defeated by a 31 foot ladder.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump We may diverge here. To receed now is to deliver territorial gain and sphere of influence concessions to the Turks and the Russians. And do not be misled by our title 5 NATO responsibilities, the Turks are not allies.
@erikaishii Our wrinkles are earned, our age distinguishing. Love you, no matter what face the camera prefers, cameras are material, their exposition revealing and judgemental. Humanity is raw and feeling. Own you first, the camera reflects it.
@JoshuaNunn18 @realDonaldTrump The conversation of those agents was only professionally inappropriate because the carried their private conversations to their government cell phones. Military, law enforcement, politicians all have political bias. In the jobs we do we check that at the door.
@JoshuaNunn18 @realDonaldTrump They are and have been an independent organization operating within the limited scope of their investigations. Your video is propaganda. Get learned.
@RealSouthard @realDonaldTrump Yeah, the investigation has a net gain of more than 20 million dollars meanwhile this guy just keeps pissing money away putting troops at the border. Get learned before you come at me.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews He has no exposure to the investigation... he knows nothing.
@realDonaldTrump They executed a warrant. This happens every day. Attorneys receive no special protection.
@realDonaldTrump Just because you say its compromised, doesnt mean it is... especially since you're position on the topic is compromised by your being the subject of the investigation. In other words, your words mean nothing.
@dubes09 @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton They have repeatedly said that all of the relevant text messages were recovered from their government cell phones. They also have personal devices, but as Trump legitimately never presents any evidence with his rantings it's impossible to know what the hell hes talking about
@realDonaldTrump Yeah, people periodically purge their personal devices.
@realDonaldTrump Wtf do you think the ACA did before the Rs in the house fucked it up?
@realDonaldTrump Yeah, because Russia seizing 3 Ukranian vessels is supposed to be a good thing.
@hitRECordJoe I'm not driving you today... or am I?
@DickFitz80 @realDonaldTrump Just curious because you seem insistent on this line of conduct, what would ever lead you to think I'm a meth head? I oppose your position, so it must be drugs?
@DickFitz80 @realDonaldTrump Your intellectual reposte is wanting and your lack of wit boring.
@DickFitz80 @realDonaldTrump McDonalds gives it to me after I've paid for it. The money Iran got wasnt American dollars, it was their currency that was frozen. Your argument is fundamentally flawed because there was not transaction in the release of Iranian money.
@realDonaldTrump They must do what is ethical and right, not feed your pet ego project
@realDonaldTrump They didn't give them 150BN, they released 150BN of frozen funds related to sanctions.

@realDonaldTrump A "tariff" is a tax on your own people to discourage them from buying international products. The billions of dollars pouring in aren't from China, they are from the elevated cost of doing business in the US. See GM.

@BambiVeracruz @EdKrassen @wikileaks First, names not Johnny. Second, the intercept is an interesting choice to get news from.

@BambiVeracruz @EdKrassen @wikileaks I dont take your meaning. I am saying that classification doesnt restrict a crime. I'm saying it is a crime to use classified material. Unless you are suggesting all classified material is a crime, to which is both patently false as no crime prohibits classified, but also stupid.
@BambiVeracruz @EdKrassen @wikileaks The crimes arent secret.
@BambiVeracruz @EdKrassen @wikileaks You misunderstand. The crime is not classified. Crimes are not concealed by classification. It is a crime to release to the public, classified material.
@BambiVeracruz @EdKrassen @wikileaks That's not how crimes are defined. They are established by statute, executive order, case law, and ultimately constitutional law. These arent people classifying their own crimes. They are crimes involving information that is classified to protect sources and methods.
@BambiVeracruz @EdKrassen @wikileaks And point of fact, crimes can be classified. That's why closed door hearings where classified information is necessary to the prosecution exist.
@BambiVeracruz @EdKrassen @wikileaks The crime isn't classified, the release of classified material is the crime. See EO 13526, 10501, 13549, 13556 and the Espionage Act among others related US code and EO.

We must be emboldened by this treachery which is both poisonous to good order and discipline and regressive, seeking to reverse 70 years of progress. Globalization &amp; social progression have their own inertia. Rs cant ebb the march to a more equal and involved people. Vote 06 NOV
The "nothing to see here" mentality is embodied fear of old, rich, white men desperate to hide their own misdoings, paranoid a shift in power is coming, &amp; will go to extraordinary measures to disguise their sabotage as patriotism. They are poisoning the well we all drink from.
Just remember where the line is now. When Rs make allegations, they do so without any evidence &amp; turn it into propaganda banners. When Ds make allegations &amp; offer witnesses, sworn testimony, &amp; hold the gov accountable to investigate, Rs cant help themselves but to interfere.
@thehill And yet suspiciously, no evidence of them being paid.
@Unruhka @jimsciutto @jaketapper @LindseyGrahamSC I am very well informed and dont buy the disgraceful stage show thinly disguising the Republican agenda to reverse our current citizenry and the laws which govern it to the 1940s. This is what happens when old, rich, white men become afraid. They encroach the rights of others.
@erikaishii Which means girls get to look cute and I get to look like I misplaced my axe... sweatily... in the south. I miss seasons.
@matthewmercer @PeterGordo Yeah, but I was 8000 miles away in Bahrain, only 3/5 of our group (including DM &amp; me) around, so I initiated a one-off in the Tal'dorei module I'm working, beginning the day of challenging. a bunch of possible combats, they chose to play like fans at a concert and It was awesome.

@realDonaldTrump You clearly dont understand that a background investigation, no matter how detailed is not capable of documenting every moment of a persons life, nor do you seem to get that an investigation into criminal allegations is far more invasive and productive. Learn your job.
@tedlieu Just remember once Congress flips, you can impeach a sitting judge
@TheCinderKing Me too buddy, still serving
@BasedScalia @thehill And that is to say nothing of your blatant disregard for the damage done to the victim, her willingness to testify and expose her raw and difficult ordeal under that scale of scrutiny, the dignity with which she did so, or that Rs abandoned their impartiality soon as BK sat down.
@BasedScalia @thehill She has enough to build a case on. To begin with, she has consistently recalled MJ working as a bagboy shortly after the event. That can confirm and establish a timeline. Your understanding of investigations is laughable, and your acceptance of one as pointless is despicable.
@BasedScalia @thehill That is not the definition of due process. A senate hearing is nothing in contrast to a full &amp; meaningful investigation to uncover &amp; corroborate, the presence or absence of evidence under which to reveal truth. That hearing was an arbitrary R side-show and a disgrace, you puppet.

@CNNPolitics That's b/c efforts to investigate to uncover evidence or to reveal by other accounts, summarily dismissed by the Maj = absolute disregard for due process. Should contest BK appointment in a lawsuit; violation of her 5th/14th-A rights before SCOTUS absent BK (conflict of interest)

Taking one of the worlds leading economies and military powers, and throwing the emergency break is going to have consequences. Agreed.
@newtgingrich @realDonaldTrump And sounds an awful lot like speeches made by Mussolini, Pol pot, and Austrian Chancellor Hitler (1938). Nearly every nationalist in the guise of patriotism has emerged as an isolationist authoritarian if not later evolving into an imperialist dictator. This is bad politics.

@jessiemaltin @nerdist @leonardmaltin @floydnorman Chris and Mary were as close to me as family. We're a little more spread out now so I haven't seen them in awhile.

@jessiemaltin @nerdist @leonardmaltin @floydnorman For me too, Aunt Carol and Uncle Denny were and (albeit with a not-as-brief-as-I'd wished period of distance) and still are family. Sadly we haven't met yet, but I look forward to it if you ever have the opportunity. I'd love to get to know that side of my family history.
@jessiemaltin @nerdist @leonardmaltin @floydnorman Dennis and Carol were at one point, my sisters godparents. I love them deeply.
@jessiemaltin @nerdist @leonardmaltin @floydnorman I've been trying to figure out how to frame this... I grew up with Dennis being Uncle Denny, and Chris and Mary as extended family cousins. I sadly dont know if my father George Polyard and Leonard were friends. I've met him only briefly and a very long time ago.

@aparnapkin @donttrythis I will be engaging this conversation in October of this year. I dont have answers. I am not an expert. I have a unique breadth of experience that is relevant. I try to create an understanding of how the words we use mean very different things
@aparnapkin @donttrythis I would be interested to expand my repertoire but also to engage in the conversation we keep ignoring... that these terms and expected reactions are operating in dialect hell. Socially we have an understanding but that doesnt match, often, what we want to see in direct forums.
@aparnapkin @donttrythis Youve established a well thought out reflection on your initial reactions and generated what I think is, a needed treatise or thought expedition on those reactions. I speak annually at Tulane on interpersonal and intimate-partner violence. Granted, this is new. I'm not an expert.
@realDonaldTrump The more panicked you become, the more worried those of us with an understanding of your impact grow concerned.
@realDonaldTrump @GreggJarrett Your dynamic and aggressive rebuttal, intended to influence the supporters you've already mislead into believing the "hoax", is nothing more to the rest of us, than an apparent desparate grab at the narrative before it breaks the keel if your sinking ship.

@arkadycosplay Wasn't meant to be a shitpost or anything offensive. I'm a fan of your cosplay and you're genuineness. Also wasnt professing to be an expert or an archaeologist, nor was I responding because of your gender. My response was intended to add context to the same conclusion. Sorry!
@Taehyung1952 @TheOnion Also by your argument, I should be in jail because I am active military and have worked on and supported operations in the middle east, Mediterranean, and in more than 56 countries. You'd be hard pressed to find anything remotely illegal in my entire life.
@Taehyung1952 @TheOnion By your argument, every military action constitutes war crimes. Murder is also significantly different than collateral damage. War crimes were certainly committed in Vietnam. I have yet to see any piece of convincing evidence that he was participant or complicit in any.
@Taehyung1952 @TheOnion Because? McCain committed no crimes.
@FoxNews @gen_jackkeane @POTUS Those weren't leaks. They were public releases.

@arkadycosplay That said he was a total disaster-gay. By all personal accounts also about 14 at the time of his first sexual encounters with men and around the time of his first military victories, but a drama queen and a half.
@arkadycosplay Gay, technically, was not really a thing in ancient Greece. Sex with other men was thought to increase verility and fertility among soldiers and sailors for when they would copulate with wives and military prisoners (thought to thin out loyalties to counqeured nation states)

@sciam Terry Schiavo. The absence of progressive brain activity independent of life support assistance and beyond minimal or autonomic life functions exemplifies brain death.
@CNNPolitics I look forward to upon my retirement becoming a commentator for CNN... in 13 years pending a better offer. Lol.
@CNNPolitics She genuinely earned more than that. This was leniency in the court as an exposition of the politically charged climate and the public's veneration of the whistleblowers. Fact remains: there are mechanisms to release info internally and to the media. Exposing classified is not ok
@Alt_NASA Remember: impeachment is not the same as trial and violates no double jeopardy. Once removed from his throne, the empty king can still spend the rest of his ignorant, bitter, and worthless life in jail. Should such a person exist.
@krassenstein @Alt_NASA As despicable as I find this president, there are protocols that exist to release information and "whistleblower through formal channels. There is no excuse to leak classified data. She should be in jail as Chelsea Manning should still be.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump He genuinely doesn't understand the calculus of that. If there was anything O gave away, it was the potential for a successful civil revolution in Syria.
@FoxNews @PressSec Fact: the US Constitution in no place mentions anything remotely close to "security clearance". Maybe give @PressSec a copy to read before she spouts more bullshit.
@realDonaldTrump WTF is that? Seriously... ambiguous bullshit platitudes, zero actual information, no message. Holy shit. Anyone ask him if he smells burning toast?
@jesttothenines Small victories keep us moving forward. Small defeats teach us. Everything has value.
@sherlock_hulmes I'm in Naples until tomorrow. If you end up in Sicily at the end of the week I'll buy you a beer.
@executivegoth you were right about the #wickeddevine its already a super impactful story and I'm about halfway through collection 2. Molly reminds me as somewhere split between luci and inanna
@realDonaldTrump @FoxBusiness Habeas corpus. Produce the body, or in this case, evidence.
@VP @NASA_Johnson @POTUS False. Demonstrably. Get it together, Pence.
@sumaleedotcom Love, if I were in Cali, I'd DM one just for you and yours. Your passion and honesty in the art are laudable.
@PatrickRothfuss @amyelizabethlu Yes
@matthewmercer Believe me buddy, active Navy here. I dont get it either.
A separate note... while I changed programs, I stayed with theater &amp; was in the final callback for our dramatic piece when I got cut. I showed up to first day of rehearsal anyway, I was offered assistant stage mgr later included Foley grip &amp; sound designer. #ShareYourRejections
I was a minor in Speech Theater at University. Had a proclivity for dramatic and subtle acting. If you weren't song-dance-jazz hands, you never did better than a C in my professors class. After two classes I shifted focus. I speak for a living, but dont act. #ShareYourRejections
@tarastrong I was minoring in Speech Theater at University with the penchant for subtlety and dramatic acting. That I wasnt song-dance-jazz hands (not meant perjoritively, just not my area) meant I would never do above a C un my professors classes. After 2 classes, I shifted focus.
@bdsmith1986 @ArseQueef I'm starting a club. We have silly hats.
@bdsmith1986 @ArseQueef Wanna be my friend? Lol.
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity Hannity is a pompous caricature. You sir, while president, sadly are not the president for all americans...  just the president for your base; whom Hannitty is just the worst mouthpiece for and portrays all of your supporters as willfully ignorant as he is. You can do better.
@ArseQueef I'm 32 and forever fucked. Happy birthday.
@realDonaldTrump He was a patriot, not a fraud.
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump People care about it because its horrifying you bridge troll.
@realDonaldTrump The golden era was always written by the elders of that era that were resistant to change. American greatness was defined by its principles not its I'll guided policies.
@realDonaldTrump Really? How many investigations? How many convictions? I'm surprised at you, Donald. Here your numbers are higher than here. #winning.
@Axis_Of_Anarchy #IAmSapien
@KaelanRhy @TheCinderKing Genuinely believed from all my personal relationships including family that all relationships were based in conflict. Then I met my (now) wife. I was wrong.
@WillingBlam @BrianWFoster I first read that as "all belts are off" today is the Mondayest of recent Mondays.

@dannymcnulty13 @TheAnthonyQuinn I dont play golf, and I'm not in LA, but I drive the shit out of a golf cart...
@arkadycosplay "My soul is wrapped in harsh repose,	Midnight descends in raven-colored clothes,	But soft... behold!	A sunlight beam	Butting a swath of glimmering gleam.	My heart expands,	'tis grown a bulge in it,	Inspired by your beauty... 	Effulgent." (Spike's Poem, BTVS) or check my writings
@SageFrancis @jbird Also, RIP eyedea and Anticon.
@MaryEMcGlynn @willfriedle @blumspew Better hair than me too... plus that's your CR baby daddy
@realDonaldTrump When you start fighting for me or my ideals instead of your image and demagoguery,  let me know. I'm waiting.
@SageFrancis @jbird Glad you and slug are keeping it real beyond the memoirs of the fallen. Met him at the Stone Pony with A.N.T. and Brother Ali back in or around 2009. Met you this year in NOLA. I miss you all. You speak complicated truths in measure and meter. Keep enlightening us.
@arkadycosplay We all know that was to punish willow's choices. It haunts me too love, and I once was known in some circles as Spike.
@jesttothenines Half-orc barbarian warlock. So much more about him... how much ;)
@ridley126 @ArseQueef I would play the shit out of this.
@realDonaldTrump Their protest is not about their income. It's about disproportionate violence and judicial punishment against black people by the police and justice system. Maybe listen to what they're saying and implement some reform.
@DnDBeyond trying to make a custom weapon but can't seem to figure out how to give it a +1 modifier. Help?
@realDonaldTrump It's time to drop this bullshit.
@JoeManganiello I'll be available in 13 years when I finish military service... or sooner if I end up going reservist and have a good offer. ;)
@ItsDaniCarr If I'm ever in LA, and I never am, I'd be happy to teach you. Otherwise just get Sam's wife to show you what's up
@arkadycosplay Sadly, I am no knight. Just a watcher on the wall. My quest knows no nobility but to be remembered.
@erikaishii It's on my list. Maybe next year. Have fun!
@matthewmercer I do so hope he plays a bard.
@sumaleedotcom Fastball special it by casting fireball simultaneous with someone casting gust or control flame. I'd allow that.
@erikaishii Welcome to the forever challenge... its been said that guitarists 20% of their time tuning their guitar and 80% playing out of tune. Sounds great, clean chord progression. It takes a long time to build up the finger strength, muscle memory, and callouses. Just getting mine back.
@CoryBooker as a NJ constituent, active Navy, and a DM you always have a spot at my D&amp;D table
@CriticalRole #critters @JoeManganiello is on @StephenAtHome talking about D&amp;D and his character Arkhan... what world are we living in? @deathsaves I love our community!
@erikaishii not knowing you, ish-ee, ee-shee?
@jesttothenines When your party gets waylaid by a cart of apples with a broken axle holding up traffic leaving a festival and they completely miss a significant event they were supposed to discover and lead to combat. https://t.co/yqGU6qHmKk
@mattcolville @LilTrashPanda You should ride in a C-2 off a carrier.
@GilTheVlogsmith Sweet. Based on wind vector, I'll geolocate your place from other images with light based on arc angle and time of day so I know where to send the edible arrangement.
@jesttothenines What have you been doing or rather, what'd that bench do to you?
@feliciaday Thank you for your support
@GilTheVlogsmith Gil, you've got a beer on me whenever and wherever we meet
@LauraBaileyVO @WillingBlam Hes the best guy I dont know... even with his cowboys thing... go big blue!
@jesttothenines I'm very interested in your art and work. I'm interested in a commission, but need some details. If you start up a patreon or kickstarter, etc. I'm contributing. I'm no venture capitalist, but I will do something.
@GilTheVlogsmith It's amazing to me that the most likes I've gotten on any of my tweets was a silly sausage joke. I love twitter.
@GilTheVlogsmith If you made a D20 out of a hot dog, it would be the Wurst material to work with...
@DRUDGE_REPORT Send them my Twitter. They cover travel.
We should all be outraged, and the very fact that the administration mandated this action with no oversight or plan for accountability of the children, their parents, or those complicit in this offense is an abject mockery of justice and against our American principles. https://t.co/tlHdGaDqpO
@erikaishii If you'll have me, I have been building and testing a limited arc for introducing players to D&amp;D and is a module (ready for DM-expansion) set in @CriticalRole and @matthewmercer's Tal'Dorei setting. If they give approval (once I finish it), I'll send it to the #critter community.
@realDonaldTrump Free press is an institution of our society. Its laughable that you think the industry is going to disappear simply because you don't like it.
@MaryEMcGlynn I didnt know you were in town. I would've bought you a round at a local dive.
@ChrisPerkinsDnD Only the ones hanging out with Steve Austin (the 6M dollar man). Thank you #VentureBros
@SageFrancis When I get demo time (turns out studios are expensive) I'll mail you a short sample of my crap.
@ArseQueef @VoiceOfOBrien Total Recall age 4 or 5
@Axis_Of_Anarchy My photo is rather dashing...
@sherlock_hulmes @CriticalRole @MCMComicCon I can fit in your suitcase.
@FoxNews @KellyannePolls @TheDemocrats ISIS is not an american sanctioned institution that can be abolished because it was never established. We persecute, hunt, and will eradicate ISIS. We can abolish ICE.
@josefferguson @Ticobell @TheCinderKing A little friendly corporate espionage... good natured competition. And he survived. Winning.
@Ticobell @TheCinderKing @matthewmercer You have room at your table? But seriously, I've been told I tend to look like Dodson from Jurassic Park.
@CNNPolitics The WH needs to clarify if they are removing access or stripping eligibility. Big difference. See my tweet to @jaketapper. @CNN please clarify this for the public.
@jaketapper @danpfeiffer Can CNN please clarify: A clearance is not a physical thing that can be "revoked". A clearance is comprised of eligibility to access, &amp; actual access to classified as limited by need to know. The WH needs to clarify if they will terminate access or are stripping eligibility.
@realDonaldTrump Really? This kind of comment puts a 400,000 servicepersons at risk you petulant naive
@LMTiefling @Gregtito Angry internet trolls killed my character with tetanus in CONCIEVABLE!
@realDonaldTrump @PeteHegseth @FoxNews None of this is illegal.
@VoiceOfOBrien Dont change a thing. Be true to you. In my game, I emphasize character knowledge vs player knowledge. It's a tightrope, but you always leave me in awe.
@jesttothenines This repartee I so very much enjoy.
@ItsDaniCarr Try your hand at sid meiers pirates. A whole other level of challenge
@CriticalRole @JoinTeamAlpha @GeekandSundry @nerdist Thank you to the studios that are developing consumer-desired content and doing it in the most epic ways. Everyday I am envious of your teams and your product. It scratches the itch to want to create while limited by my work.
@ArseQueef @samriegel @SideBySamuel I'd let him speedbag my scrotum if I could find a way out of my industry and into something creative without wagering my salary or financial stability
@realDonaldTrump They're contract says they get paid. Here's an idea, first time POTUS disgraced america, public rebuke. 30th time, impeachment.
@thehill Stand on the wall for our freedom, then you get to have a position.
@thehill No, it's not in their contract, also you're an idiot. Freedom of expression brother. They dont disgrace our flag for refusing to acknowledge it in protest, they honor its symbolism. You disgrace the flag by demanding a private organization punish them. #disgrace
@jesttothenines The answer is yes... at least until the same cow passes twice. #ThingsILearnedFromMovies
@realDonaldTrump Google originated in the UK and while most of their industry is now present in the US, the tech giant has been undergoing multiple fines and tariffs over a host of different securities violations and net-neutrality violations. Context matters.
@ThatKevinSmith I once thought I tweeted you, but it turns out I wasn't me... I was my alter-persona "Super Dave"
@matthewmercer @sherlock_hulmes My one-armed half-orc barbarian warlock would agree. Cleaved from shoulder as an offer to his patron when the tide of battle got very bad. A charisma check gave my familiar a new ability. Though last session, we gave an amulet to a servitor of Orcus to save 2 of our own, so...
@hitRECordJoe She never came home.
@TheCinderKing @nbcbrooklyn99 Also	BOYLE: I wanted to like Striking Distance	BRUCE: SO did I
@TheCinderKing @nbcbrooklyn99 BOYLE: Yippe ki yay Mr. Farmer. (And variations)
@TheCinderKing @nbcbrooklyn99 Yeah, you get it. Lol
@nbcbrooklyn99 @TheCinderKing Jake bff with Bruce would be fun and probably a nifty challenge for jo latruglia to play against
@jesttothenines Well that's nightmare fuel... I guess we can give the donut eating me a break.
@PatrickRothfuss I've heard when getting a signature not to call out another author's name... apparently its uncouth...
@ChrisPerkinsDnD Do you have any recommendation for a format when developing a module within a campaign setting? @JeremyECrawford @mikemearls @Wizards_DnD @matthewmercer
@jesttothenines @TheCinderKing Stationed in NOLA and restationing to Key West with my wife at the end of January. Hoping I might make it to NYCC but it's gonna be up in the air. Genuinely, whatever has you in the hospital... recover well. Thoughts &amp; prayers are not my flavor, but kind words... anyway, well met
@jesttothenines @TheCinderKing Also, didnt realize this was you. I'm floored by this. You and your fiancee will have a beer on deck if we ever meet at a con or elsewhere.
@willfriedle @matthewmercer To be fair, I dont know him, or you... but I like you both. &lt;3
@jesttothenines Its sincere. Nothing is more of a comfort to me in times of challenge than in knowing of the gift of being remembered.
@thehill Did the NRA ask for his card back?
@jesttothenines I shall have a character named for you in my next session. To at least our small group of players you will be immortalized in the pantheon of Tal'dorei NPCs. A speedy recovery and let calm thoughts allay your pains.
@VoiceOfOBrien Thank you for sharing this with the community. Many of us were worried about you at that time, but admire your strength and perseverance.
@VoiceOfOBrien I am reminded of Sprigg (and source material from Doctor Who) we are all stories, in the end... try to make it a good one. Several philosophers more successful than my rudimentary forays have said: the greatest gift is in being remembered; and to be forgotten, the deepest hell.
@TessFowler @EarthbreakGroon Count me in... after the ass-kicking, I will bring a bubble gun for @executivegoth and take everyone out for FROYO... or I'll just send messages to people I don't know from my computer and mobile devices because I live too far away. I'm with you.
@realDonaldTrump Do you really only listen to people who praise you? We're in bigger trouble than I thought. Sir, please stop playing the ratings game and do some real work. You're not the people's president if you only listen to your voters. This is getting ridiculous and sad.
@jakface_mcgee @VoiceOfOBrien Somehow I didnt see Talesein as blue, more of a puce...  but it works.
@VoiceOfOBrien I'd love to RP Rowlf doing D&amp;D. Perhaps a half-orc bard.
@CecilBaldwinIII House of Leaves, Mark Z Danielewski. You'll want to keep it close because you will trust nothing.
@brielarson saw you might be in NOLA. Br sure to check out G.W. Fins for some awesome eats (I'm a local, not affiliated or an advertiser) and Boondock Saint, a home-in-the wall beloved dive (where my wife will be working graveyards a couple days this week). See ya there!
@DeadlineWH @MSNBC @NicolleDWallace Resign sounds easy, but we have bills to pay.
@CriticalRole @TaldoreiDay wish me luck! 3rd game of my developing Tal'Dorei module. Planned for 6 players, I have now between 8 and 14. Improv on the spot (@Wizards_DnD any cr balancing for parties this big?). 4-5 sessions remain. With CR approval I'll send mod to all #critters
@erikaishii Plus pig roast? Haven't done that in years. I'm gonna have to put this shenanigans together when I get to the keys.
@erikaishii Keep making me jealous. That shit never happens to me.
@FoxNews @seanhannity "Alleged by this indictment" context and words matter. Hannity, you're an idiot.
@realDonaldTrump It's about what they knew and when. And when they found out, there were sanctions, and diplomat expulsions... but I thought it was fake news that they hacked... now it wasn't? Uh oh... you've talked yourself into yet another inconsistency and lie you can't get out of.
@scannernewsnj I've been on that call.
@Ocasio2018 @oldmanebro @EBROINTHEAM Also, if you run and need a geopolitical analyst, I can be persuaded to clear my calendar.
@Ocasio2018 @oldmanebro @EBROINTHEAM Build your base. Gain experience with the mess you're about to walk in to. Contribute. Learn. Hold them accountable. Never forget that winning won't be enough. It's the toughest fraternity. Climb. Represent the constituents. Call me when you run POTUS out of office. I'll be there
@tedlieu @POTUS I have many opinions. The smallest voice right now are from service members bound to article 86 of the UCMJ.
@thehill More than a year overdue.
@realDonaldTrump Do you have a solution to meet their energy needs? I'm sure they'd be very interested when you suggest combinations of coal and immigrants (high caloric content) as combustibles. You haven't thought through any of this have you? You just have Congress puppets waiting time.
"In the beginning, the universe was created. This made a lot of people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad idea" - Douglas Adams https://t.co/lGIMaTbiuq
@VoiceOfOBrien What's your next ambitious objective? Return to theater? Any specific role you'd love to play?
@realDonaldTrump He was one of many agents working on the case.
@JewelStaite I still can't get tweeting right. Especially not being able to edit for typos.
@realDonaldTrump They come from very different budget lines. Texts like this are consistently misleading.
@realDonaldTrump We're not covering their expenses... jesus, read a book.
@2impostors @CriticalRole @executivegoth @LauraBaileyVO @VoiceOfOBrien @matthewmercer Wow... just... wow.
@mib5799 @Axis_Of_Anarchy Only with the blessings of @CriticalRole of course.
@Jamie_Devall The character I was playing was or became an excuse. I couldn't find why he was there so I stepped away. That took some heat. I dont begrudge anyone. Not all characters suit every campaign.
@mib5799 @Axis_Of_Anarchy Tell you what, if you're up for a "theater of the mind"  campaign, find me some people that want to do it and I'll run a 5th edition Tal'Dorei model on a monthly. I'm down to do it on twitch, but I'm concerned about licensing and dont have equipment. We can work it out...?
@neiltyson Maslow*
@neiltyson Pretty sure Maslov had a theory about this... perhaps it was a hierarchy, even.
@Axis_Of_Anarchy @JeremyECrawford @satinephoenix Can do... for a limited time only. Next duty station is Key West arriving sometime late Jan or early Feb.
@Axis_Of_Anarchy @JeremyECrawford @satinephoenix Oh, and also... you're gonna crush it!
@Axis_Of_Anarchy @JeremyECrawford @satinephoenix As usual, I am perpetually jelly. If you ever happen to my neck of the woods, beer and D&amp;D conversation is on me.
@Axis_Of_Anarchy But that's old fashioned tabletop style
@Axis_Of_Anarchy I hear that. Our weekly is on FG but our DM has been using FG for a long time has a lot of the modules and maps and stuff loaded up. I'm not too familiar with discord, but I hear good things. The 15th will be my 3rd session of a Tal'Dorei module I've been building. 11 players :o
@Axis_Of_Anarchy What platform are you using?
RT @VancityReynolds: Less than 30 seconds. https://t.co/QPopgegBLy
@ChrisPerkinsDnD Remind me to add a random poll with a DC 25 perception difficulty into my next session.
@realDonaldTrump Literally no one is advocating like your assertions suggest. Fake news? Fake facts, Mr. President. You have a responsibility to the truth. If you cannot tweet responsibly, you will be held to your perpetual lies and misleadings in the polls. You have your base fooled, not all.
@JustinTrudeau As our indigent leader cannot be expected to show the dignity of office. Thank you, and know most of us arent very happy right now.
@CriticalRole @Critters_CC I recently had to step away from a campaign b/c of the relationship with the party &amp; the rogue character I was running. A neutral evil character in a largely neutral party, if I served my interest or tried to aid I got flak. Anyone else go through this?
@erikaishii Ok... ugh... how was it? Brp...
@FoxNews @PressSec It's called patriotism when usurpers have set democracy under seige, led by a pretender-king.
@realDonaldTrump Next time, maybe let someone who is worthy heap praise on the armed forces.
@washingtonpost False words from a man who has done neither in his own boots.
@adultswim Fine, but only as far as I can throw you, Greg.
@matthewmercer Pledged today. Keep up the good work.
@realDonaldTrump You write like a 4th grader... a failing 4th grader.
@realDonaldTrump That's not how anonymous sources work.
@realDonaldTrump Actually, the overwhelming majority of MS-13 arrests are conducted by local police and DEA.
@GilTheVlogsmith It sure is pretty. ;)
@hitRECordJoe Any recommendations on starter vox equipment or software?
@Alyssa_Milano @charlie_adler I support this and applaud your activism. I only own a vest (turns out legal guns are expensive) but as active duty military I try to visit a range as often as I can. You can shoot with me anytime.
Can't we all just play d&amp;d? #critter
@hottestsingles I mean, is there even another kind of flesh than weeping? Not on my plate, sir.
@TroyBakerVA It's too convoluted to actually post excerpts but he is playing hand and foot from the Machiavellian handbook "the prince".
@FoxNews @PressSec We dont negotiate with terrorists... or willfully ignorant despicable human beings.
@EdKrassen Is that accurate? 12.6? Or 12.6 million?
@TroyBakerVA I Can Love You Like That was a better song. Just sayin'.
@ItsDaniCarr I agree. @TheMattKey
@thehill I'm gonna be SIQ that day.
@WisePapaGrant I'd Skype in.
@JeremyECrawford @KikkaVO @Wizards_DnD Respect to the point and the intent. On a mildly lighter perspective, I recently built a water genasi barbarian who was previously a human pirate before being drowned and resurrected (after a fashion) by the stormlord. A very different type of trans.
@Axis_Of_Anarchy Woo-sah, Frendo.
@marcorubio Perhaps the administration should be advised to stop attacking the IC as well. Integrity and credibility are everything.
@marcorubio So you assert for media to not do its job, holding government accountable for their actions, because it makes your base defensive? Then here's an idea. STOP ATTACKING AND ATTEMPTING TO DISCREDIT THE MEDIA. Persistent attacks have hurt the public trust and encourage ignorance.
@nj_taxation in 2016, I refiled my 2013 taxes (I paid, but I was exempt under military). I called and reached out for 8 months for them to tell me they never got it. I filed again. I still have not seen a check. Your phone system is a nightmare. Can anyone help?
@realDonaldTrump Just you and most of the administration cronies and enablers that you've inundated yourself with... "drain the swamp" after all.
@arkadycosplay I'd get in on that only if I could be an awkward firbolg with a skin condition. ;)
@EdKrassen @SenateMajLdr subterfuge and subversion are still illegal right? Or at the least, you can identify them as immoral? Oh wait, you have a moral compass like a ceiling fan. No confirmation until after November, you disgraceful insult to humanity. #noconfirmation
@politico That's because @SenateMajLdr is the puppet of authoritarian ideology and enjoys obstructing the rights of American citizens, not to mention directing the insurrection against democracy that prevented Merrick Garland from sitting on the court. In short, he's a disgrace.
@MSNBC @SenateMajLdr 's obstruction of @POTUS44 's appointment of Merrick Garland for the political manipulation of the courts against the interest of the American public and the rightful authority of the sitting President to install a court vacancy was an insurrection against the state
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Like you respected @POTUS44 's nominee in Merrick Garland? Get bent, then get out of office, you disgrace.
@wilw Respectfully, the DNC stonewalled Sanders and HRC was always gonna be a gamble against Trump... people don't like her, and there is history that tainted her self-branding. Its not what the Bernie bros did... its that the DNC couldn't back a supportable candidate.
A case example of how the Republican party is conceding democracy to Trump's authoritarian idealism and an abject demonstration of the tragedy that by an act of insurrection against the State, the GOP usurped the lawful right of Obama to have installed Merrick Garland. https://t.co/eZpqz03g4t
For those who have recently followed me, my posts on here (at least for the time being) are gonna be a blend of some nerdy stuff and carefully measured political criticism and responses. For the record, I lean left of center... but it also seems like we forgot where we put it, so
@FoxNews @lizpeek Literally, any behavior in contrast to the bar being set by this administration is borderline noble. That's how bad it is at the top.
@FoxNews @mercedesschlapp @realDonaldTrump @foxnewsnight I believe the term is "usurping of..."
RT @nytimes: Here's the 2018 election calendar 	https://t.co/x9wJt4d8o3
@chrislhayes To clarify, I'm not eligible in 2020. I am aware he has only 2 terms barring anything wild happening. I know I will not have the enjoyment of unseating him.
@FoxNews @mercedesschlapp @realDonaldTrump @foxnewsnight She's clearly not paying attention.
@chrislhayes Here's a scoop. If POTUS gets 4 more years in 2020, I'm resigning my commission in the USN and running for office in 2024 to make sure that we repair the damage and it never happens again.
@natemcdermott Even as a left-of-center, but center isn't where we left it guy, hes a rational Republican. Hope the dems win in Nov, but he might be the least objectionable GOP candidate in the races.
@jdavidgoodman @natemcdermott @JoeCrowleyNY Those things are exactly the problem in Washington.
@JewelStaite Shiny
@rockrichard The real shame is that we all still have to bow to the almighty dollar. Between the paycheck and the UCMJ I'm more limited than I would very much care to be.
@matthewmercer @Elycium @executivegoth Ditto. Holy shit.
@realDonaldTrump The incoming doesn't like you either.
@EdKrassen No. A crisis of democracy was when the sitting president was denied his right to install a justice in a vacancy at the supreme court. This is an autocratic insurgency actively seeking to destroy our democracy.
@blumspew @realDonaldTrump Verde*
@blumspew @realDonaldTrump I think appropriately it will all be Latin American including a taco bar featuring carne asada, swordfish ceviche, and pulled pork barbacoa with toppers of cotija cheese, pineapple mango pico, corn salsa, and tomatillo salsa verse and only mezcal or water.
Just a reminder... just because something is legal, does not mean it is ethical or should be done... there are a lot of legal things that are generally poor decisions or bad ideas.
@CNNnewsroom He's full of shit... I mean, that's apparent. And this was openly broadcast as anti-Muslim. The decision simply stated that the policy, independent of the impetus, is within Executive authority. Partisan dissenting is a pretty clear indication that while legal, its bad practice.
@blumspew @realDonaldTrump I will do a pop-up for this.
@TheCinderKing Moon Tree a-ok, little buddy.
@realDonaldTrump I think "where's the beef" is both a more profound and legit question... this is nonsense.
@realDonaldTrump Dude... classified material.
@realDonaldTrump No. It isnt.
@realDonaldTrump Responsible for less than 3% of all crime.
@FoxNews @POTUS You realize by putting these together, it's not hard to infer that he is encouraging shooting illegals, right? I mean... you get it. Dont you?

Just got the heads up all that was tuesday... late to the party as usual.
@jasoncmiller @Hydra_Lord @GilTheVlogsmith Jason, congrats on tonight. Ivan, dont let my brother get you too drunk. Gil keep an eye on him, he' wiley.
@ddale8 I hope someone is totalling the cost of all of this from taxpayer wallets
@chrislhayes ICE is rapidly becoming the Gestapo and it's getting harder to not genuinely believe everyone working for them is morally bankrupt. Most are probably trying to keep their paychecks but how they can execute these corrupt and inhumane policies is beyond me.
@realDonaldTrump You dont have the votes with the Republicans you have and you control both houses. Lots of luck when we take it back.
@realDonaldTrump You're not listening to your citizens. They're the ones with the protest signs. You're capitulating to the brainwashed hateful throngs.
@arkadycosplay I go through 3-5 jars of pickles a month. Cucumbers are just about the best veggie.
@willfriedle @OriginalFunko Pity the studio wouldn't let you get the hat trick... you'd've made a pretty Harley Quinn
@PatrickRothfuss You ok? I know we dont know each other and arent real world friends... my contacts are always open...
@realDonaldTrump Horseshit. All of it. You have the majority in both houses. You can't get Republicans to support you.
@Anthonysmdoyle @chrislhayes I genuinely wonder if this is her intentional opportunity to embarrass Donald. I mean, she's flying down there to look at the situation he created. Maybe this is passive aggressive retribution.
@Anthonysmdoyle @chrislhayes Appreciate it. Saw the comment in daily mail but in the context that was said, it could have been inferring a doctored image... multiple statements pretty much rule that out. How careless could she be?
@Anthonysmdoyle @chrislhayes You have a quote and source?
@chrislhayes I haven't been able to verify it yet.

@EdKrassen Simply, yes. They just don't have the mechanism to do so.
@realDonaldTrump So I suppose you'll be returning the Statue of Liberty to France? @EmmanuelMacron perhaps you should rescind it and give it to Canada... they are out-America-ing whatever this country is becoming.
@jaketapper Jake any way you could get your compatriots to remind @realDonaldTrump that countries arent "sending" immigrants &amp; emigration, particularly asylum seeking is because governments have failed to protect threatened populations. They're asking for help. Criminals Don't seek asylum.
@SenatorMenendez @PatrickRothfuss Dont pat your high horse just yet. Go pass a bill. Make this shit impossible to do again.
@samriegel Act 4: Profit
RT @MSNBC: JUST IN: American Airlines has requested that the US federal government "immediately refrain from using American for the purpose…
@Marisha_Ray I've literally been warning about this on FB and twitter and to everyone providing commentary on it all week.
@chrislhayes Again, I also caution: Following the negotiation of this ransom in whatever form or shape that will take, expect political campaigns from the GOP touting "I defended families" or "I stood up to Trump" when their willful ignorance caused it. Children arent political leverage.
@realDonaldTrump Dude, Europe has wildly more open borders. Also open borders isn't new... "Give us your tired, your poor"... Crime has not exponentially gone up in any demographic more than middle aged white males... far above immigrant violations. Not to mention political fraud. SAD!

@TakaZareth @TitusNation Active Navy here. Well said, and Titus, keep making our guys who live with and witness horrors so we can sleep safe laugh. Our sense of humor sets us apart from the extremists.
@thehill @realDonaldTrump small hands go along with small minded behaviors it would seem.
@AC360 @CNN @SenJeffMerkley @billmaher Caution: This smells of a classic political setup. Refusing to send guard and even the bills in both houses of Congress represent the right thing to do, look for campaign platforms saying "I stood up to Trump" or we voted for families. Basic humanity isn't a platform.
@ObeyMyBrain @VexsTrinket @matthewmercer @VoiceOfOBrien @samriegel @LauraBaileyVO @WillingBlam @Marisha_Ray @TheVulcanSalute @executivegoth I love this.
@elonmusk buddy... we're all hopeful for the visions you've guided many of the companies youve created by. As a friend, maybe scale it back a bit on the waxing whimsical or battling common assclownery. We look to you for technological vision. Dont squander your considerable favor

@bumblebee2_0 @willfriedle My Date With The President's Daughter as Duncan was a lot of fun.
It's funny, but you'd think that among every immoral, unethical, and criminal thing done so far by the administration and the people surrounding it, that of all of that, extricating children from their families and using them as political leverage would be cause for impeachment.
@PatrickRothfuss Can't help with Columbus, but I'll buy you a beer next time you're in new Orleans, at least before the end of the year.
@realDonaldTrump You're right about one thing. While you're president it is indeed a dark and dangerous time.
@realDonaldTrump 2/2 Also, the investigations which you rail against resulted in no prosecutions. Your investigation has more than 20 including 5 guilty pleas and more than 80 crimes as defined by the U.S. code. We are a country of laws, not a country of what Donald thinks is the law.
@realDonaldTrump I will say this again... the illegal, criminal, immoral, or unethical actions of an individual, are neither equal to nor justified by any similar or same actions by another. Just because one person got away with a bad thing doesn't mean its ok. Also they were investigated. 1/2
@realDonaldTrump Your policy is forcing this. CHILDREN ARE NOT LEVERAGE
@matthewmercer @DnD_Lioness In so far as their placement and mechanical arrangement I.E. "the suspect decided to use symbology in placing the ankh on his victims neck". Symbolism is the interpretation of the symbol or series of symbols representations "placing the ankh on the neck may symbolize life"
@matthewmercer @DnD_Lioness For everyone who commented on this, simply looking up the definition is not sufficient. A few responses here are correct that either symbolism.and symbology are interchangeable in the use of symbols... sort of. Symbology is the study of symbols or the use of symbols 1/2

@realDonaldTrump That was a nuclear threat that your rhetoric escalated in the first place, and all they've done is sign a piece of paper while you gave away the store. You went there, gave them what they wanted, and came home with a promise... "thank you for your contribution".

@realDonaldTrump I would like to meet with you and have you point out Singapore on a map. Or Taiwan. Or Nepal. Or the paracel islands. Or the Seychelles. Or the senkaku islands. Or disputed Kashmir. Or Babylon. Or the ardennes. Or know which of those is fictional.
@realDonaldTrump You do understand that there is a significant difference in our GDP and our population? Their priorities mustn't be ours, lest they serve the needs of Americans and not Germans.
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Capitalizing on merchandise instead of governing, using your pulpit as an advertising tool... these are perversions of the american market. You understand neither economics, nor morality, nor ethics. The damage you are doing will take decades to repair.
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump You're a fool to think that is the issue. You're approach will ruin workers in America when allies and trade partners stop buying our goods. Trade is done in volume. Supply and demand. They will find the goods elsewhere. Your supporters will find a bread line.
@realDonaldTrump Because trade is a tool, not a mechanism of equal share. The world doesn't operate in a free marketplace. The value of trusted allies sometimes comes at a trade iniquity. We gain from them in other ways. This is called diplomacy. Treaties, armistice, and alliances are the reason.

Its bad enough to walk away from this meeting with all of the prostrating leading up to it and rather than let NK walk away (as expected) to cow-tow out first, but to do it in such an uneducated, indelicate and informal writing is shameful.

@MattGertz And if they did, we count the ones we couldn't save. I've lost 28. I can remember every single one of them. Nothing is so telling as an EMT in the back of an ambulance, wrecked because they had to use ALL their training; tired and defeated with the caption: I'm sorry, I tried.
@MattGertz I've been an EMT for 10 years, both professionally and volunteer, 7 of which I've been partially active or inactive for military service with the US Navy. I have more than 5000 911 calls under my belt and as a crew chief trained many to take the mantel  heroes don't keep score.

@ender07 Make sure to swing by Boondock Saint on St. Peter. Tell Jamie that Mike sent ya  also hit up Bad Wolf Bar on the west bank.
@FoxNews @IngrahamAngle I guess we can ignore even the collective of hopeful economists' report that they arent seeing any evidence of the growth promised and the absence of a corporate investment upswing will likely bring a burden upon both the investor and the taxpayer while the corporations are safe.
@thehill This also means he didn't read his own tax bill which, while there were many questionable decisions, morality gaps, and general logic failures, it did raise the military pay across all rates and ranks by 4 % at the time of its implementation.
@HuffPostPol Technically by all reporting I've seen (and to be fair, there's been a lot to chew through), Louis C.K. only engaged in "deviant" masturbatory practices among consenting women. Every single one that complained about him all said he asked to perform his lewd acts.

@WillingBlam Its great for casters against ranged and ranged spell attacks and if you get up close and personal you can still choose to use it or not. Every round. So a squishy 14 becomes 16 against a devastating attack and you dont burn anything to do it.

@DisneyD23 Bring. It. Back.
@rlinarts How much does your work run?
@arkadycosplay I'm aware of this and I try to keep it in an even keel, bet even so... Also, "yelling" can be a subjective thing. Yelling to one person could be talking loudly and emphatically to another... to a point. Yelling in my family was how we communicated, its hard to break that.
@arkadycosplay Apparently this is a thing, and its getting some traction. Some experts say that its a societally conditioned response brought on by exposure to male-driven violence as nearly every woman has been or knows someone affected by male violence. Most men have no idea this is a thing.
@CritRoleStats @matthewmercer what was the calendar date of the death of Raishan during the deceiver's stand? I'm looking to use the date of the death of the last of the Chroma Conclave as a holiday "Dragonsfell" in a mini Tal Dorei campaign. #criticalrole

@TitusNation I love that the journalists are pushing them on their positions, testing if theyre just parental sound bites - the kids have complex defenses of their views showing a carefully articulate understanding of the complex problem. They are holding the elected accountable to the same.
@RichardDawkins I almost wonder if ignorant rhetoric is a memetic defense mechanism. If we consider religion a memeplex of cultural replicators like biology is of genetics, memes thereby must have their own defenses to preserve self replication against a tide of insurgent viral logic.

Let us fight on their behalf while your ilk do nothing. Stupid twit.
@perlmutations @TomiLahren First, without a PHD in psychology you aren't qualified to call anyone a lunatic with any real meaning. Second, a lunatic with a gun vs. a lunatic without a gun... are you seeing the difference yet? Let me help you out. 900+ lives since 2000, claimed mostly by racists
@AngelofWound @TitusNation I agree dodge would not be responsible, but vehicle ownership and operation is heavily regulated and monitored. I'm not blaming the gun. I am blaming our irresponsibility to effectively regulate and police ourselves.
@TitusNation Sorry, in the typing something got screwed up. AR=Armalite Rifle.
@TitusNation Also, I think that these shootings are fucking ridiculous, require common sense regulation immediately and there is no good argument to defend "my right to have guns is more important that your children's right to safety". We are all responsible for this shit every time we vote.
@TitusNation To be precise, AR means ArmaLite... the original developer of battlefield-styled semi-automatic rifles. The rifles persistently used in this senseless shit are functionally no different than handguns, except that they have an extended range due to the long barrel and rifling.

@Comey @tarastrong I'd be very curious to your opinions on my thread this morning.
@SenateDems @HouseDemocrats , history shall reflect the complacency of the elected powers in the administration of these injustices. The foundation of this country is being eroded under the authoritarian megalomania of this chest-beating fraud. You must act now.
Robert Muller must indict and Congress must begin the impeachment process. All complicit and participatory agents of this conspiracy must be charged and removed from the offices they hold. This includes the entire present @WhiteHouse &amp; @Cabinet of this administration.
Further, the very intent of these parties to engage in such a malfeasance of office and such a gross dereliction of duty, in concert with one another, is tantamount to Seditious Conspiracy (legal scholars will debate over intent and use of "force" in the law) and Insurrection. https://t.co/JD7I82h38a
It is clear that the intent of the public sob-story and constant deflection is, by both @POTUS and @HouseGOP / @SenateGOP allies, an attempt to exert the force of their platforms and offices to mislead the American public and an open conspiracy to usurp the bedrock of democracy.
This morning's @POTUS tweets, again attacking the veracity of both the institutions of the @TheJusticeDept and the @FBIWFO and a misdirected impeachment of the investigations conducted therein, is itself an obstruction of justice through the intent to sow public distrust.
@realDonaldTrump Youre holding 800000 people hostage and blaming the dems because they wont submit to you keeping a gun to their heads. History will reflect your avarice you foolish foolish disgrace.

If we partner and stop them trying, they can find a way to safety. The countries arent sending us their worst... their most intelligent, bravest, and with the most resolve make it to the US... ask the hard question... how do you fix it? The answer is insanely simple. Compassion.
If you want to stop illegal immigration, the best option is to partner with the country the people are leaving, work with them, improve them so they arent losing their talent and we dont take the burden. For every succesful immigration legal or not, many more die trying.
Give every person desperately seeking to leave the corrupted provinces in mexico a safe haven. Give them a partnered bill with mexican support an amnesty with the option to reintegrate. Stop making demands and offer protections. Make Mexico work to get their people back.
@chrislhayes @jaketapper @Acosta @seanhannity why not, instead a wall, a 2400 mile welcome center, staffed by federal employees, with a temporary protected status with a deadline... make yourself useful or leave, protect children, and give amnesty to every illegal. Start at 0? RT
@realDonaldTrump Dont pretend to know what the military needs, or for that matter, what this is about. The dems had a legitimate beef, you tied it inextricably to your rediculous wall.

@PioneerOutdoors @michaelshermer @SamHarrisOrg But doesnt the very concept of applying perspective and making that argument make it subjective? We can agree its good... but good does not necessitate moral
@RonyKozman @michaelshermer Only if you can source the obligation.
@AdversityGift @michaelshermer Thats a flawed argument because it presupposes there is a god to get rid of. Id argue there is not.
@AdamCox11 @michaelshermer I think faith and religion here need to be separated. Individual faith and however that shapes a personal morality is fine, i think religion has no business in morality.
@PioneerOutdoors @michaelshermer @SamHarrisOrg Then indeed I could agree that the fundamental concept of morality is to palliate suffering, but I think how that is to be effected and by what belief is more important than the underlying intent... more moral relativism, less moral skepticism.
@PioneerOutdoors @michaelshermer @SamHarrisOrg Im not suggesting there arent commonalities. I am suggesting that those commonalities only structure what morality may look like, not its content or execution, that being a functionary tool for population control and civil advancement, regardless of the flavor of morals.
@PioneerOutdoors @michaelshermer @SamHarrisOrg And as a memeplex or meme itself would retain subordinate or component memes from the cultural structures that inherited them. Yes all morality may share similar genes, but their vast differentiation suggests that those components only aid to define what we call morality.
@PioneerOutdoors @michaelshermer @SamHarrisOrg Yes, but they are largely reductivist. That morals over eras have similar baseline components doesnt necesitate a blueprint anymore than any persuasive argument involves language. If anything, that evidence is suggestive that all morality is a memeplex with some common memes.
@PioneerOutdoors @michaelshermer @SamHarrisOrg Agreed, but I think tgere is historical evidence that suggests morality is at least subjective to the social norms of the ruling party or population, which can be extrapolated as a reflection of the zeitgeist. Morality is a tool in that effect, not the subject itself.
@PioneerOutdoors @michaelshermer @SamHarrisOrg Others like John Locke would suggest that morality is established as a functionary prerequisite of society, Utilitarians and pragmatists will say morality is simply the function most effective to benefit the largest population and is nothing more than a social construct.
@VoiceOfOBrien Just play the high two keys on the piano... per Venkman, they hate that...
@michaelshermer Its worth noting that the very concept of morality is more a reflection of a zeitgeist than an definite imperative. Morals are temporal. The pinnacle flaw in the initial question is the assumption that there is an obligation to begin with. If anything it may be a social contract.

@glover_ceo @FoxNews @SenJohnBarrasso Completely agree. Gaslighting this tax cut as good for the middle class will only result in enabling the GOP to go after their perennial enemy, Social Security and Medicare. They will use a problem caused by their own policy to push the long term agenda and hurt the middle class.
@glover_ceo @FoxNews @SenJohnBarrasso Agreed. While market stability / confidence does effect economic growth, problems when POTUS equates them and as a result of him. The best indicator of economy growth (IMHO) is deficit depth, gov't fungible assets, comparable dollar value, and foreign ownership of US debt bonds.
@glover_ceo @FoxNews @SenJohnBarrasso To be fair, while his economic policies (if you can call them that), or the deregulations by executive order (weren't really into effect until 4Qtr17) his announced plans may have measurably effected corporate and consumer confidence. Scale of the impact is debatable.

@SageFrancis If youre still in town, ill buy you a drink. Im in the quarter.

#criticalrolefanart @Critters_CC im no artist, but I think the Honey Heist is the perfect opportunity to update the dogs playing poker painting.
@ChloeBennet4 You've never had mine. And yes, thats a standing invitation.
@pattonoswalt @DavidKHarbour your pic actually reminds me of the quaffed dustin... #neverforgetyourfarrah
At One Eyed Jacks. @SageFrancis it was an honor to meet you, and a pleasure to see you perform. Thank you for your kindness.
@SageFrancis @SFRupdates Good day to have them... it got windy and chilly. See ya tonight, and hold one of those hoodies for me :)
@criticalrole @geekandsundry you have the voice actors, you have a campaign guide, you have a dedicated audience... so when is the 16-bit style RPG coming out? Tal Dorei is a perfect setting for something a la Secret of Mana.
@JT_VanDeman @realDonaldTrump Not disputing that. However you have to consider the logistical nightmare the british army had of having to sail across an kcean to provide supplies and reinforcements. While hiroshima ushered the end of the war, theres nothing to be proud of in the use of nuclear weapons.
@JT_VanDeman @realDonaldTrump Imm gonna add one, though its poor form... it is inherently stupid to use a war on the continent currently being debated as an example of superiority. If we were such ass kickers in Korea, we wouldnt be having this discussion. You argue poorly. Ass-kicking isnt the US banner.
@JT_VanDeman @realDonaldTrump Doesnt count as a win. Arguably, all of the first three resulted in arbitrary re-bordering and/or colonialization and the abandonment thereof at the cost of millions of lives through today. We are militarily superior. But thats not the threshold for asskicking.
@JT_VanDeman @realDonaldTrump Revolutionary war vastly predates modern technology, in both WWI and WWII we came in like the cavalry years into a war already being fought with money and resources, and won... certainly not alone, and a war that ends in an armistice or ceasefire... 1/2
@realDonaldTrump And youve espoused no meaningful way to make that happen. In the 60's the I Have A Dream speech mobilized people to a specific end. This is not your "dream" speech. Koreans simply dream of being able to sleep without a missile defense system.
@namecantbemine @realDonaldTrump I know. :( but maybe people on his twitter do.
@FoxNews @POTUS Who is in charge of this nation of disparate people with independent cultures? Who leads the koreans who have known only their isolated culture of dominance under their god-king? Who leads the unisolated but jaded koreans? What does the cultural bridge look like?
@PressSec @POTUS Standing ovations mean anything more than a good publicity shot? Respect maybe, muscle memory... probably.
@realDonaldTrump What have any of those partners done, outside empty sanctions barely enforceable and easily subverted?
@realDonaldTrump Which parts of our past are you referring to? Please... examples, not mindless juvenile rhetoric.
@realDonaldTrump You are so very wrong. The acquisitions and appropriations process requires all established contracts be filled prior to executing new mandates. Failing to do so costs thousands of jobs and circumvents congress. Youre not doing anything new. Not that the forces will likely see.
@GeekandSundry @CriticalRole I had more hair when i started taking this picture, but ive never been good at selfies.

@thehill IMHO, to suggest that lawmakers cannot or shouldnt sleep in the wake of such an event is to not understand the complexity of the issue.
@RubeyRoo @FoxNews Sarcasm... obviously.
@RubeyRoo @FoxNews I love the interest in an emoji crisis, death penalty for brown mass murderers and silence on white ones.
@realDonaldTrump The DNC blackout on Sanders while unethical... not illegal strictly speaking. Also you might not have noticed... HRC isnt President.
@enthusiamy A twist on twister where colors and shapes are decided by draedel spins and dart throws to the sounds of a cellist? Maybe too fluxus.

@MandysMounds @wilw Further, certainly the entirety of the DNC and Sanders repeatedly rebuked violent actions by any of his supporters calling 4 peaceful reform
@MandysMounds @wilw There has been nothing other than circumstantial evidence presented in formal proceedings to suggest which parties incited the violence.
@MandysMounds @wilw May 17 2016... long since rebuked and debunked. Meanwhile POTUS's own words have specifically called for violence on the campaign trail.
@MandysMounds @wilw For the record, this individual, by virtue of the acts of violence, is not a progressive democrat.
@wilw While technically it appears as domestic terrorism, that requires the intended outcome, not the act be politically motivated. Dont know yet.

We must continue to #resist. We didnt win anything yesterday. There is no prize. We just prevented a loss for millions. The good must thrive
These wins are against the very forces of entropy destabilizing our sovereignty, the failure of logic and reason, good order and discipline.
Please remember, these victories arent against republicans, so much... they are against fear and  privilege, fascism and abandonment.

Twitter emoji test... i have still not figured out the sorcery that is this platform. 🖕🗿🍆🍣🍻
@matthewmercer i still havent quite got this twitter thing figured out. But those quick to judge listen to respond not to understand.
@matthewmercer I am right there with you. Sensationalism to obfuscate evidence and reason. Jumping to conclusions doesnt help anyone.
Speculation while an investigation is ongoing obfuscates facts over impassioned rhetoric. Intent and motive are not yet known.
A reported attack has occurred near the Westminster Bridge outside British #Parliament. Early reports 1 dead, many injured. Don't speculate.
A great article to get a baseline of the growing progressive movement. #resist https://t.co/XWBAzmQj4x via @HuffPostPol
Comey also exposed himself: during election comment on Clinton email invest; silence on ongoing Russian collusion invest #resist @braddjaffy https://t.co/cgoV2ANn2T
@AhoyhoyJet @TukRoll @CriticalRole wow... just... wow...
@Outback what witchcraft is this!?
Im considering in not the long term a career change to leave serious and endulge nonsense. Open to tips on parlaying to voice acting.
@matthewmercer when does the book come out?
@GeorgeTakei @neiltyson get a lode of these guys!
@OpenLegendRPG Demigod Bounty Hunter... I am very ok with that.
@matthewmercer starting a campaign. Downloaded the app you recommended. Havent found a good guide to update it. Do you have a cheat sheet?
Ill also be using a gruff Jason Statham style voice for him ;)
Oh, character name: Lothar Wolfslayer of the Eyegouger Clan
@LauraBaileyVO @VoiceOfOBrien get to NOLA for Mardis Gras with custom #criticalrole beads.    I know people...
@CriticalRole @Critters_CC thanks for the RT! If anyone needs more detail I can send a character sheet.
I still cant do a tweet without multiple fixes and attempts and replies. God i suck.
also *Lovecraftian... stupid typos.
Dick Tracy/Indiana Jones style in Neverwinter. Made sketchy deal with Great Old One Cthulhu for eldritch powers. Unknown cost. #warlockstuff

Sorry for the multiple hits. Still not great at twittering.

You dont see his losses, or the years he slept on foreign shores. You see a man in a hat. Who looks a little more serious than the rest.
You see a man at a bar. You have no idea of his contribution to maritime supremacy, the depths of his personal battles to get there.
Ellis Island sacrificially burned as an offering to Bahamut the light bringer (AKA Steve Bannon).
US replaces Liberty Island's "give us your tired, your poor" with a giant neon sign that reads "No Vacancy"
ICYMI: Canada out-America'd the US. Next week: France recinds Statue of Liberty, relocates it to Ottawa.
Not just criticisms and vitriol being passed around in a hundred other formats. Resist by your mission and the truth.
Using this new platform to share obsequious resist ideals and memes. this is about not being censored and oppressed. Share relevant info...
To all of the ALTs popping up. This is an opportunity to spread truth, science, and facts... but in the lanes of the organization you ALT.
What do we want?! Evidence based facts! When do we want it?! After peer review!
Support free speech, fight alt facts. Join the resistance @Alt_NIH @AltNatParkSer @Alt_NASA @AltForestServ @altusda @RogueNASA  @althhs
@AltNatParkSer never thought the #resistance would begin with the NPS, but its fitting. Perhaps my next career will be park ranger.
@BadlandsNPS I didn't expect the resistance to begin with the National Parks, actually fitting. My next career might be Park Ranger.
@SabrinaAnnLynn @RowanBlanchard  remember the world is imperfect; requires the best version of us. Thank you for helping a new age learn it.

@pattonoswalt  #mensmarch Way to go! This is now national news via @HuffingtonPost. Right in that pretentious shit-heel @piersmorgan's face!
@willfriedle Are you going to be back on @CriticalRole or is this something new?
@MrBillDaniels Love your work, looking forward to reading this. https://t.co/DabVrODijK
@pattonoswalt #mensmarch gave a 45 minute lecture on itchy balls to very stoic woman in line at Sears. Was a mannequin, register was closed.
@pattonoswalt @piersmorgan #mensmarch #nola I'm bringing the patent of the toilet paper roll to prove the right way incase things get messy.
@pattonoswalt @piersmorgan #mensmarch #NOLA Taking a bullhorn to a women's support group meeting to mansplain mansplaining. Wish me luck.
"'Jumbo shrimp' is discriminatory and marginalizes other shrimp!" "What was with the toy genocide in toy story 3!?" #misiontodisrupt
Fuck "alt facts", enjoying alt reality w/ #criticalrole. Also alt protest posters. "Sauerbraten is only OK!" #misiontodisrupt
Starting a campaign #missiontodisrupt complete with non-sequitors and things to otherwise break away from the bullshit filling my feeds.
Perhaps Ill toss my hat in the voice actors business and play with you all on season 15 as a level one.
@CriticalRole you guys have something special here. Im envious and thankful for you.
@hardwick #feelthegern
@CriticalRole any chance you guys would like to have a non famous service member guest for armed forces day? Happy to volunteer.
@Jamie_Devall yeah, I remember! Hope all is well.
@CNN Credibility is everything. Whats the plan to combat false news and public aversion to facts? DJT compromises your credibility. Fix it.
@CNN Willful ignorance and confirmation bias are problems. DJT tweets arent as important as effects. Separate cause &amp; effect.
@CNN america decided democracy means one person's ignorance is good as another's expertise or facts. #issacasimov
@CNN we've sentenced generations to clean up this mess, if anything is left for them to inheret. Policy by tweet isnt good enough anymore.
@CNN crony capitalism in motion. Tell them why they need to care. Take a position. Media fail of campaign season. Low millenial investment.
@CNN oligarchic homogonized militaristic cabinet = dangerous. Globalization has inertia. Sending us back has global consequences.
@CNN the public has a right to be informed. You arent asking the right questions. Right now is more important than dem election regret.
@CNN stop pandering to your advertisers commercial time and ask the follow up. Hold them accountable. Party lines arent good enough.
@ABCNetwork plenty of opportunity to expand GMW. Character growth is great. Happy to write it... GMW haunted mansion. #wdw magic kingdon

@HBO In the light of the circus that this political season has been, now more than ever, you should bring back the Newsroom and Aaron Sorkin
If you're worried about troops in harm's way, IT'S THEIR JOB TO BE IN HARM'S WAY. That's why you get to sleep at night... and not in dirt.
Do you want an American armed military that is present because host nations pay us? If you do, look up "Mercenary" in the dictionary.
@realDonaldTrump @davidgregory @CNN You got thrown off because you said nothing of substance and have no platform. You're a fool, Mr. Drumpf
Let me just tell you, I have no principals, When I heard the question, What they said, I was concerned, but I have no principals. #Trump
@realDonaldTrump ... and if I could just tell you, I have no principals... listen, what they said, I was concerned, but I have no principals
