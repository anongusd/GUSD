A truly great thread from @RevCLBryant about how the Dems' victimhood attitudes lead to big government dependence which further keep Americans down.		Be sure to catch him on @foxandfriends tomorrow morning! #ampFW https://t.co/EQ8q71aCmc
"Through entrepreneurship and empowerment, black America is rising to greatness. We are getting back to work. These achievements did not warrant applause from the Democrats on the House floor, or a single mention in Stacey Abrams‚Äô rebuttal speech."
"President Trump has loosened regulations on small businesses, empowering black business owners to keep their doors open and protect the livelihoods of their families and their employees."
"Thanks to historic legislation like the First Step Act, black families suffering from an epidemic of mass incarceration are getting a second chance at life together. Their loved ones are getting a chance at redemption, to become productive members of society."
"The reality is Trump‚Äôs policies have done more for the black community than Obama‚Äôs ever did. Since President Trump took office, 4 million people have left the food stamp program. Wages are rising. Unemployment for Americans w/o high school diploma at lowest rate ever recorded."
"According to Abrams, plants are closing and layoffs are looming. More than 600,000 people with new manufacturing jobs would be surprised to hear this, especially Roy James, black plant manager at the Vicksburg Forest Products lumber facility, which was saved by TCJA."
"She insisted hard-working families are being left behind, despite 5 million new jobs and the lowest unemployment rates in half a century. She ignored the 304,000 new jobs created in January (double what was expected)."
"Sadly, Stacey Abrams, the first black woman to deliver a State of the Union response, perpetuated this damaging message of entitlement and victimhood in her remarks following the president‚Äôs speech." https://t.co/2NU7CjU4r8
"Modern Dems need black Americans‚Äô to depend on size of government. They want our votes, and our fear. They want us to believe that without them, what little we are given to make ends meet will be taken away. That we can‚Äôt thrive on our own grit. That we need them to survive."
"Now we find ourselves enslaved once again, this time voluntarily, to a culture of government dependency. Big-government policies have trapped us on a plantation of food stamps and welfare checks."
"Our abolitionist forefathers died fighting for the freedom and self-empowerment of black Americans. They believed our rights come from God, not the government. They knew that with equal access to jobs and education, the black community would rise."
"In that moment, I realized the 116th Congress is not diverse at all. The new generation of Democrats in power may look different, but their ideas are the same: big government, less freedom, and a message of entitlement and victimhood."
"Instead, we saw outright disdain on their faces. Nobody clapped. The message wasn‚Äôt worth celebrating, because they didn‚Äôt like the political party of the messenger. " https://t.co/tSnTDaEza1
"When President Trump announced that African-American, Hispanic-American, and Asian-American poverty rates have reached their lowest recorded points in American history, we should have seen a standing ovation from this modern and diverse Democratic Party." https://t.co/krF9FcBPJn
"That pride was short-lived, as I realized most of these newly-elected Democrats are fighting for agendas that hold my community down in poverty." https://t.co/TNIWjMjkvh
"I watched with pride as President Donald Trump delivered the opening remarks of his #SOTU address to the most racially diverse U.S. Congress in history. This scene, I thought to myself, is one big, beautiful step toward achieving the dream of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr." https://t.co/FH1k2IGh3s
