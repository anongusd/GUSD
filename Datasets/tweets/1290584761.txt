@sendokicks23 @BobbyMarks42 I am confident KP will have a great season with the Mavs next season! I appreciate the Dallas Mavericks taking their time with KP, and making sure his return is not rushed. I am also looking forward to the Dallas Mavericks team next year.
@sendokicks23 @BobbyMarks42 They will have the same amount apparently. Mavs will have 30+ million in cap space apparently. What they do in signing KP to a long term deal is mutually exclusive cap-wise in comparison to their cap space. #Mavs #MFFL
@sendokicks23 @BobbyMarks42 I am skeptical about the KP trade deal because the trade cannot be graded until what the Knicks and Mavs do this offeason. Furthermore, KP has to have a great season coming off his ACL injury.
@sendokicks23 @BobbyMarks42 I would the Dallas Mavericks to sign KP long term this offseason. However, hopefully signing KP to a long-term deal does not affect their available cap space. #Mavs #MFFL

@RajGiri_303 Do you think Smackdown Live and Raw can be booked equally strong?
@realonlinejack @pdx_mavs @KirkSeriousFace Hopefully, the kings go on a winning streak and beat the Mavs when both teams compete with one another.
@pdx_mavs @realonlinejack @KirkSeriousFace The Mavericks have to keep the Suns at bay by losing to them on Wednesday. If the Mavericks win they will more than likely swap worst records with the Suns. The Mavericks have to keep losing.
@realonlinejack @pdx_mavs @KirkSeriousFace So where do you see the Mavericks drafting realistically?
RT @SportsCenter: Dennis Smith Jr.'s crossover + dunk is a thing of beauty. #SCtop10 https://t.co/FJugm3TNs5
@realonlinejack @pdx_mavs @KirkSeriousFace Do not forget Luka Doncic. I think he is going to be a top 5 draft pick this year.
@pdx_mavs @realonlinejack @KirkSeriousFace Is it possible for the Mavericks to even draft Ayton? I mean Atlanta, Orlando, and Sacramento has to go winning straks for the Mavericks to swap spots with these teams based on record alone.
@RajGiri_303 I was listening to the review and I respectfully disagree on your stance about Smackdown Live. Smackdown has been #1 show in the WWE. The reason is why they have built up stars for the WWE the past number of years. These same stars on then placed on RAW.
RT @blakegriffin32: https://t.co/1uoIZ0Sxcc
@PeteyVengeance It depends on if Wesley Mathews gets traded sometime before a week from this upcoming Thursday. The Mavs could have two #1 picks in the first round. Then depending on whom they pick in the lottery will decide if free agents want to go to Dallas.
@GlennRubenstein @RondaRousey @WrestlingInc Glen Ronda should be going to Smackdown Live. This makes more sense if think about it. Plus Smackdown is the #1 brand in the WWE
@pdx_mavs @realonlinejack @KirkSeriousFace If the Mavericks continue this trend (which I hope they do) they will get a great pick.
@PeteyVengeance They will draft Bamba, Bagley, or Ayton. I know they will get a great basketball player.
@pdx_mavs @realonlinejack @KirkSeriousFace That's why they have to keep losing! This is necessary to ensure that they get a top #3 pink.
@WrestlingInc Let Raj know Smackdown is the #1 brand in WWE. Imagine what RAW would be without Smackdown.

@BryanBroaddus The offense side is in it's prime and ready as it's ever going to be. The Cowboys need the same kind of defensive talent to match.
@BryanBroaddus If it means that I get bonafide  pass rusher who will consistently get double digit sack production on a year basis I will sir.
Whomever gets drafted tonight God bless them and their careers moving forward! #NFLDraft #DraftDay
@BryanBroaddus If Derek Barnett falls to #19 or #20 I am trading up to pick him if I am the Cowboys.
@EpicNemec The Cowboys must come out of this year's draft with four starters.
@EpicNemec Not only do they need a pass rusher but they need to double down and draft two DEs with their first two picks.

@matk92 We are going to draft a great player today. Today is the day the Dallas Cowboys defense returns to prominence.
@TayStern In your opinion would the Dallas trade up for Derek Barnett if he falls into the 20s? #CowboysDraft
@TayStern However pass rusher is imperative for the Cowboys to rebuild their defensive line.
@TayStern Taylor I was not able to get my question in on time on the Facebook live session with Stephen....

@TayStern Happy Draft Day Taylor. God bless you and thank you, @BryanBroaddus, @nickeatman, and @HelmanDC for everthing you all do.
@DCC_HeatherH It's key that at least four of their seven draft picks are capable first year starters or contributors. I am confident that that will.
@DCC_HeatherH I am ready for the Dallas Cowboys to continue their rise to prominence. They are are going to have a great day. #CowboysDraft
@HelmanDC @dpbrugler @BryanBroaddus I am only picking Jackson if he is there at #60 or the Cowboys trade back, and acquire two 2nd rounders.
@HelmanDC @dpbrugler @BryanBroaddus If Derek Barnett somehow falls to 19 I am trading up to get him if I am the Cowboys.
@BryanBroaddus to move into the second and have two second round picks this year. The Cowboys will likely hit on the first three picks this year.
@BryanBroaddus I would go DE with the first two picks in this draft. I would use our third this year and a premium pick next year...
@HelmanDC I really believe the Dallas Cowboys oversold the idea of not trading up and actually do. The Cowboys need a consistent pass rush.
@dpbrugler Dane I think a trade back for the Cowboys is going to happen. I just don't see them drafting Jackson at #28. #CowboysDraft

@TheDraftShow @HelmanDC What are some projected first round DBs who may fall to the Cowboys at #28?
@TheDraftShow How many defensive ends on the Cowboys draft board would have to be picked in front of #28 for the Cowboys to trade back?
@TheDraftShow Hypothetically, can the Cowboys trade out of the first round to acquire a 3rd round pick and use the same 3rd to move up?

@TayStern I think the Dallas Cowboys are on the cusp of making a Superbowl. As a matter of I know that they will be on the big stage soon.
@TayStern That is the story to be told. However, if the selection numbers were Superbowls instead of pro bowls that would be even better.

@HelmanDC What are your feelings on this draft David? Are you confident the Cowboys can find a great player at #28?

@dpbrugler Dane how do you think the Cowboys approach the draft? Could this draft potentially be an all defensive draft?
@TayStern Just a hypothetical... If the Cowboys draft all defensive players can they keep all these players and start them?
@BryanBroaddus @HelmanDC @TayStern Charlton, Mckinley, or Barnett are there at #28? Whom do you draft first at #28 and why?
@BryanBroaddus @TayStern Between Budda Baker and Obi Melifonwu who do you draft and why for Cowboys?
@TayStern @BryanBroaddus Barnett, Charlton, or Melifonwu are there at #28? Who do you draft if you are the Cowboys?
@JC1053 Budda Baker or Obi Melifonwu at #28?
@SlaterNFL Depending on who is there at the end of the first round I would draft by position in this order: 1.) DE 2.)CB 3.)CB and 4.)S
@SlaterNFL @MikeMayock This will allow all the great defensive players to be pushed to the end of the first round.
@SlaterNFL @MikeMayock My hope is that the first two thirds of the draft is offensive heavy.
@SlaterNFL What is the likelihood the Dallas Cowboys find an excellent pass rusher at #28?
No matter what the future holds for Mr. Smith God bless you and be with you.

@TayStern Therefore, if either Derek Barnett, Charles Harris, Obi Melifonwu, or Budda Baker are there I am taking them
