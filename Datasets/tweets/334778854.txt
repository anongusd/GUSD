You're not happy because you're not happy.
You being poor, sick and depressed isn't anybody else's fault. It isn't the white man or any other person. It isn't God's fault either. Our lives and how we live them are our own determination and how we feel about it.
Real prayer feels good. Real confession of the Word feels awesome. The Glory is addictingly ecstatic. That is the feeling of God in you. That is the feeling of what you want from God coming to pass. That is true Christian hedonism.
If you do faith confessions or affirmations without feeling the Spirit of God within you then you just did a vain repetition and don't expect a manifestation from such a waste of time.
2019 will be a great year if you feel 2019 is a great year. Master your emotions and take charge of your feelings. Yes, it really is that simple.
Nobody has ever gotten healed feeling sick. Nobody has ever gotten blessed feeling broke. If that wasn't true, there'd be miracles in Presbyterian churches.

The Republican Party are accessories to the treason that elected Donald John Trump as president and if we don‚Äôt vote and raze Hell about this, the republic will be over.
Today, republicans in the senate which was elected by a minority of the voting population, confirmed a lawyer as the head of criminal for the doj today. He has never tried a case in federal court; civil or criminal.
In 2040, 70% of the United States population will live in 15 states.  Though the US will be a majority minority country, 30% of the population will control 70% of the senate and be over represented in the electoral college

#SchumerShutdown if every Dem votes no and ever GOP votes yes then the budget passes. Why are conservatives calling this a Democratic shutdown? Must they lie about everything? Even if it's obvious?
#SchumerShutdown I love how these #tcot are conflating the shutdown with the fiscal cliff. Can't get more stupid.
#SchumerShutdown even if the Dems are pro-illegals or whatever @FoxNews says, Dems cannot stop Congress from passing the budget. Republicans (@freedomcaucus) are voting to shut down the gov't and @SpeakerRyan and @SenateMajLdr need Dem votes to pass.
#SchumerShutdown I'm sorry Joint Budget Resolutions are not subject to filibusters according to the Standing Rules of the Senate. @SenateRules
#SchumerShutdown is the greatest proof of cognitive dissonance. The @GOP has the MAJORITY in House and Senate. Dems by the math cannot shut down anything, and don't give me the filibuster excuse. They could change the rules.

Souls don't go to Hell because of sin. They go because they rejected Jesus. Souls don't go to heaven because of their righteousness, they go because they accepted Jesus. That's the Gospel.
The price that Jesus paid for our sins is much greater than the sins of the entire cosmos. 1 Cor. 6:20 7:23.
Your sins are not a problem with Jesus. 2 Corinthians 5:19.

It's wrong to think that if you're doing what God wants you to do, then you will never face any opposition or problems.
I think Trump should be called "Obama Revenge". Anything Obama did, Trump is trying to destroy. No policy, no leadership style, was Obama for it? Then I'm against it!

Man was depraved even BEFORE he sinned. That's why God gave us a wife. Gen. 2:18; Prov. 18:22
