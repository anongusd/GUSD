Chehalis Chairman Harry Pickernell Sr. told me the tribe’s main goal in building this distillery and brewery is to provide new jobs to community members.

https://t.co/7MNEdvaH6U
It will be a win for the Chehalis Tribe when it’s allowed to build a distillery, brewery &amp; educational training facility on its own land.
