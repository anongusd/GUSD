Two coasties have died this week, if they hadn’t passed a CR to temp lift the shutdown then these families wouldn’t be receiving the death benefits in a timely manner, that shouldn’t be ok to anyone.		#PayOurCoastGuardAct
@super_calla_ @tpichette @SenJoniErnst Matter fact, why is anyone introducing any bills right now? They need to be working on the budget before we end up in another government shutdown, the fiscal year started four months ago, this is ridiculous.
@super_calla_ @tpichette @SenJoniErnst I think they instead should have introduced a bill to force all insurance companies to cover things like genetic testing and anatomy scans so that issues can be discovered earlier and families have more time to decide earlier on.
@super_calla_ @tpichette @SenJoniErnst Again, totally for a woman’s right to choose, especially when it comes to things like the baby having a condition that makes them “non viable” at birth, I just don’t understand the need to allow it to happen in the third trimester.
@super_calla_ @tpichette @SenJoniErnst I think a lot of people are excusing the comment because they are assuming that he just wasn’t fluent on the subject, but he is a former pediatric neurologist, so it’s not like he isn’t aware of when babies are capable of living outside of their mothers womb on their own.
@tpichette @super_calla_ @SenJoniErnst I’m all for a woman’s right to choose, I’m even against the 24 week rule a lot of states have, but I can’t fathom a reason to wait until the third trimester (let alone up to labor) to make these types is choices.

@techknow1776 @SenatorLankford Again, my stance is that if carrying a baby to full term will only end in the death of that baby, a woman should have the right to choose not to continue with that pregnancy. We won’t agree on this, so I hope you have a wonderful night.
@techknow1776 @SenatorLankford That’s not what I believe at all, there are plenty of conditions a baby can be born with and live a happy life, I’m not talking about those conditions, and I hope that the term “non-viable” isn’t being used by the medical community to describe them.
@techknow1776 @SenatorLankford I agree that all life is valuable, but I would never demand that a woman continue with a pregnancy that will only end in the babies death, that is not something I could force on anyone. There is no reasoning that could move me from feeling that. Have a good night.
@techknow1776 @SenatorLankford Everyone can’t afford these options, and it causes terrible delays in the discovery of some conditions.
@techknow1776 @SenatorLankford Genetic testing and in-depth ultrasounds should be something that is an option for every woman, certain states don’t require it and that adds to these late discoveries.
@techknow1776 @SenatorLankford I don’t think there is any reason to wait till 8 months to abort a baby. I think there should be  a limit on everything minus the mothers health. There is no reason to me to wait past 27 weeks, unless the baby’s issues where not discovered till after that for some reason.
@techknow1776 @SenatorLankford The law was 24 weeks in New York prior to this, not 27 weeks. 24 weeks, after that it was considered a felony to conduct an abortion for any reason.
@techknow1776 @SenatorLankford And yes losing any child is tragic, but in these cases the family knows ahead of time &amp; they should be able to choose to not drag that tragedy out and wait months to give birth or to take their other children through that journey with them. This is something that deserves choice
@techknow1776 @SenatorLankford But each family should be able to decide what is right for them, they should be allowed to choose, that’s all this law does, it doesn’t allow anyone to decide they didn’t want a girl or that they baby looked ugly on the ultrasound, they simply get to choose not to watch them die.
@techknow1776 @SenatorLankford Prior to this new law, it was a felony to conduct an abortion after 24 weeks in the state of New York.
@techknow1776 @SenatorLankford Have you ever watched a baby with one of these “non-viable” issues die after birth? Have you ever seen what it does to a family? Maybe if you had than you would understand that this is not something that should ever be forced on anyone.
@techknow1776 @SenatorLankford My personal opinion is pro life, but I would never force another woman to carry a baby to full term and give birth, just to watch that child die.
@techknow1776 @SenatorLankford A lot of very serious chromosomal abnormalities are not discovered until later in pregnancy, many of which are confirmed after 22 weeks, the 24 week deadline forced women to make a choice to abort when they may have chosen to carry to term if they had time to actually think.
@SenatorLankford From what I’ve read, it allows women to have late term abortions if their own health is in danger or if the baby has a condition that would cause it to be “non viable” after birth. It’s not a free pass to have abortions at any stage because it’s a Tuesday &amp; you felt like it.

@BLDirks @PattyMurray Why am I even arguing with you, you clearly can only see the world from your point of view. It must be nice to have so much money and so few bills that you could work a job and not need your paycheck. Have a good day sir.
@BLDirks @PattyMurray If any of these “furloughed” members that are currently still working were employed by the civilian sector their employers would be in violation of the fair labor standard act and the 13th amendment of the constitution. But I guess it’s ok because it’s the government, right?
@BLDirks @PattyMurray Their life choice of working a job? And needing that job to pay their bills? You’re the one that sounds really entitled, sitting in a position where you’re so comfortable that you can look down on hard working people who need their paychecks.
@BLDirks @PattyMurray And what about the people who are still working? Should people not be entitled to be paid on time for work they perform?

I wish lying cheating a*s people would stop wasting good kind hearted loyal peoples time and tears and energy.		Just admit what you are, live in your truth, and go find another sh*tty person to go live unfaithfully ever after with.
If you cheat, you are trash. No excuse is good enough. If your significant other really sucks that much then leave them, the fact that you don’t just shows that it has nothing to do with them and everything to do with the fact that you’re a sh*tty person.

There is no excuse for purposely damaging a person that you claim to love, there is nothing they could possibly do to deserve it.		If you did it, it’s because it was already in you, and that type of behavior says much more about who you are, than who you are claiming them to be.

I don't think people even realize how the #ElectorialCollege works, they don't have to give it to Hillary either.		#ThatBoxIsBestLeftClosed

Worst nights sleep in a long time, yet here it is, morning already...		My life would be so much easier if I was a coffee drinker....
I want nothing more in life, at this exact moment, than a giant hamburger, cheese fries &amp; a pepsi with crushed ice.......
Just because it fits you, doesn't mean it "fits" you.......
Never felt sooooo old, 8pm on a Saturday night &amp; I'm laying in bed praying this baby will hurry up &amp; falls asleep so that I can go 2 sleep 2

Omg, it's only 6am? I feel like I've been at work for soooooo much longer than an hour 😕
Instead of being upset with someone for not trusting you, try being someone worth trusting.......
Whoever thought those GIANT gym mirrors were a good idea #SUCKS.		Watching parts of me wiggle &amp; the rest of me struggle is NOT motivation 😕

Soooooo sleepy but in desperate need of some me time 😪😪😪😪😪😪😪		Damn you 4am!!! Why do you always come so early?? 😢😢
It's 5am &amp; I've already spilled tofu juice ALL over myself...		#Yuck, I don't even want 2 know how this will smell by the end of the day....

Having a large #family may not be easy but it's soooooo worth it,  there is a #magic in watching #children #love each other 💞💕💞💕💞💕💞
I was bitter when they replaced #Dexter with #RayDonovan, but now I regret waiting sooo long 2 give it a chance. AWESOME show 💜💕💜💕💜💕💜
I know I'm late but i can't believe Zach went home 😭😣😠😭😣😠😭#BB16
Dear people of #SanPedro,		PLEASE stop overestimating my driving ability,  I WILL hit your s**t!!		P.s. The bike lane is NOT a passing lane!
Finally getting around to watching #SonsOfAnarchy, only on the 3rd episode but OMG @KateySagal do you ever age? You are BEAUTIFUL!!!! 💕💞💕

#World's #largest #rubber #ducky http://t.co/IgAHotjjQP
Only 4 more days until the last episode of #TrueBlood EVER...		I'm not ready😭😔😭😔
RT @AfricanaCarr: Imagine the effect on the now-romanticized U.S. Civil Rights Mvt if mass media had been allowed to direct the narrative. …
1st day of no soda (I keep falling off the wagon)...		Greatful that I don't have a drug addiction because I obviously have no #willpower....
I LOOOVVVEEE @Torrei_Hart, she is ADORABLE 💕💖💞💕💖💞💕 #hollywoodexes
Omg, I haven't had @CornNuts in FOREVER,  I almost forgot how #amazing they #taste 💕💞💕💞💕💞💕

Grapefruit if the only #food that I love and hate at the exact same time 😆😣😊😑☺😬😃
If it wasn't for you @pepsi, I dont know how I'd survive being up by 4 after this baby woke me up ALL night long.		#LateNightsEarlyMornings
Lol, Scrappy is sooooo wrong for allowing his mother to believe she should sing on national TV #LHHATL
I keep having flashbacks of Eric &amp; Ginger, Ugh, least sexy sex scene EVER....... #TrueBlood
I can't figure out who I want to win, stuck somewhere between Donny &amp; Derrick 💖  #BB16
First Brie Bella, then @RandyOrton, now @JohnCena. UGH #SummerSlam!!! I can't believe I postponed #TrueBlood  for this nonsense....
The Miz looks like a topless dominatrix with those pleather panties and thigh high boots 😃😄😃😄😃😄😃 #SummerSlam
#SummerSlam at 5, #TrueBlood at 6... OMG I don't think I could choose, thank goodness for my DVR....
In noooo way do I think I have the best body, but I bet if u had 4 kids you'd wish u had my body.		#SelfieSunday 😆💖 http://t.co/HsJ2TD6ynr
Up early eating popcorn and watching #HemlockGrove 😆💕😆💕😆💕😆
Sometimes, everything you ever wanted, isn't what you wanted at all.......
Its about time they retire #colossus. I LOVE rollercoasters but that raggedy wooden beast is painful 2 ride &amp; sounds like its about 2 break.
Waking up this early on my day off is not natural 😪😪😪		Soooooo sleepy 😪😪😪😪
4 little people's whole world starts &amp; ends with me. They are #beautiful, #healthy, #happy &amp; #love me more than I deserve.		I am #blessed 💕
Super excited about the premier of #Legends, I needed something to fill the void in my TV life since the end of #BreakingBad &amp; #Dexter 😆😆
Fingers crossed that the second day of school goes as good as the first 😆💟😊💜😆💖😊

Just got my a** kicked by a 7 year old in a monkey-bar crossing contest, I swear I used to be awesome at this!!! #growingupsucks
I am my worst critic but after seeing all these wayyyyy less than perfect broads posing half naked on IG, I feel pretty #sexy 💕💋💕💋💕💋💕
It's crazy to see the contrast between Mr. White Season 1 &amp; Mr. White Season 5. Hands down best show EVER 💖💚💛💜💟💗💖 #BreakingBadBinge
WTF Bill?!?!?!? #TrueBlood
GIANT glass of wine ✔	Kids momentarily entertained ✔	HBO on ✔		Waited a week but it's always these last 5 minutes that kill me #TrueBlood

The worst thing you can do to someone who struggled to allow you in, is to prove that they were right to keep you out, #Becareful
I'm pretty sure that yeast infection tastes EXACTLY like this non-fat plain Greek yogart that I'm currently forcing myself to eat. #Yuck

Never underestimate the power of pretty hair &amp; low cut shirts....		Cleavage is like Kryptonite :-)
Spending my first real day off in like FOREVER catching up on laundry...		Responsibility is sooooooooo lame....

I wish I had a friend who dabbled in plastic surgery....... A little bit of Lipo would be SOOOOOO awesome :)
