@hoyawolf @tweetsintheME The discussion shouldn’t be binary. It’s better as a conversation about real need vs incrementally institutionalized and casually assumed perks, and rolling back the rank-has-its-privileges senior ethos in the forces (and in government) that fuels distrust like mine.

@fallujahredux yes, yes, &amp; yes. the math still doesn't begin to work. example: USMC in helmand prov. ~20% of US force on ~2% of pop. never came near getting it all secure, much less establishing govt &amp; services, or undoing poppy production. (sorry for cramped conversation. it's twitter.)
@37Foxiest @fallujahredux you use an essential word: "realistically." realism has been missing from the whole conversation. back-of-envelope math:  &gt;30m afghans, ~100k us troops at peak. could 100k us troops occupy and reorganize texas, which has &lt;30m people? what was DOD thinking?

@AdamWeinstein @Jckluge “defense” is a bad euphemism in this context.
@EINS_Institute @ExumAM @jpderosa that’s *likely* less a factor now bc US no longer has brigade/battalion rotations of patrolling units in established outposts. but that was a commonly observed pattern when 10s of 1000s of troops were walking remote ground.  (i’m open to recently experienced dissenting views)
@thecla923 @ExumAM And i forgive Ex his tweet bc 140s
@thecla923 @ExumAM Yes. That’s back to my first point. I’m not convinced the “military” has a rosy view of this, at all. The flak corps and the presentations of senior leadership do not square w the robust skepticism (and sorrow) below.
@FOB_Haiku @JournoGeoffZ @ExumAM Bingo
@thecla923 @ExumAM Ex’s pt re DC deferring to cdrs is excellent &amp; a useful illustration of a blood-letting absurdity at work. DC determines “strategy,” budgets the resources, assigns the cdrs to impossible circumstances, then expects cdrs to rep the war cheerily, then seconds the cdr’s flakking.
@ExumAM i know elements of the officer ethos, &amp; tradition, militate toward deference to commanders. but there’s not much admirable about flakking for war adrift. morality, &amp; decency, &amp; leadership, demand better. for those still doing it, history will be unkind.
@ExumAM and the larger point still holds. i’m not convinced the assumption that the people who speak most loudly for war actually believe what they say is a sound assumption. they often look to me like bureaucrats and careerists trapped in a broken system’s message machine.
@ExumAM fair point re dc/kabul/tampa/bragg (&amp; formerly brussels/dc/kabul/kabul/tampa/bragg) distinctions. i lumped them together bc 140s. also: the war’s organizing ideas &amp; ambitions, the “strategy” (such as it is) must come from dc. &amp; the view gap btwb dc leadership &amp; troops is enormous
@ExumAM that's only if "the military" believes what the "pentagon" says about how the afghan war is faring.  I don't think it does, on balance. what comes from the mouths of the leadership and (on-record) PAOs bears little resemblance to what is heard/observed from field. (for years.)

@ClaudNix with tabasco sauce to be atomized for riot-control-gas-like effect? causing ferocious eye irritation and requiring sandstorm medevac?  ask @MatthewECole74 about this. [warning: turn down volume on headset first]
@ClaudNix and i suspect we agree on one matter — there are better criticisms and analyses of trump’s military policies, war leadership, and relation to the services and their people than “he hasn’t spent part of a day in afghanistan.”
@ClaudNix that’s fair.
@ClaudNix you think an E-1 being glad-handed by the prez, w senior enlisted looming nearby and generals at POTUS’s flank, is going to truth-dose the system? i don’t put good odds there. but again- i’m not saying visits are all bad. just that they are less important than might appear.
@RalphMoore_NC i don’t mean to suggest that prez visits are *all* bad or *entirely* self-serving. but there is less value to these visits, &amp; more tiresome hassle around them, than some of the strident “trump hasn’t been to bagram” voices are letting on.
what paul said.  brief prez visits, w attendant generals &amp; troops as props, is not a strong measure of POTUS war leadership, or even heart.  whatever you think of trump, griping about no visits to afg/iraq is not especially throughtful criticism.  https://t.co/IOKRr8NloZ

@intensionality @AbraxasSpa @MENA_Conflict @tomddumba @Tmgneff @johnismay To me that’s like saying “my liver is already shot so why quit drinking.”  Nonproliferation requires, well, nonproliferation.
@intensionality @AbraxasSpa @MENA_Conflict @tomddumba @Tmgneff @johnismay I know you are. I take different view. Pumping small arms into nations saturated w them, &amp; beset by corruption/unstable politics, is fuel for more long-term violence. Weapons last longer than careers of those who carry them. Shipments as short-term fixes often look unwise later.

@Jacob__Siegel @aaronstein1 @dr_tgpeterson @arzandc @thegrugq @pstanpolitics yes, thus the caveat: *some hope."  (and even the Q-course-qualified practitioners assigned to too-fast mission sets and unrealistic goals were often fluent in real-time re why what they were being told to do would not work. this beat some of the pie-eyed COIN takes from higher.)
@aaronstein1 @Jacob__Siegel @dr_tgpeterson @arzandc @thegrugq @pstanpolitics i won't pretend expertise (or even in-depth knowledge) of the specifics here, but generally when I hear "group" in discussions about US COIN i have some hope that maybe professional practitioners are involved, and that nonsense is less likely to be dominant.

@dr_tgpeterson @aaronstein1 @arzandc @thegrugq @pstanpolitics You should have seen the kommentariat a-list that got access to sit-downs, dinners &amp; phone chats w American brass to help w the COIN sell. Meanwhile, local people &amp; occupying troops were suffering in this feel-good, can-do war fantasy, on ground where the population loathes us.
@billmcneely @arzandc @thegrugq i remember trying to engage cdrs in discussion re other models for COIN, as applied in Uganda, Chechnya, Sir Lanka etc, &amp; drawing blank faces/mumbles about Petraeus. It was awkward. Meanwhile, many troops called BS &amp; went through minimal *COIN* motions while trying to stay alive.
@aaronstein1 @arzandc @thegrugq yeah, the USG approach was: let's draw a few examples from history, tell troops to follow air-brushed *lessons learned* we gleaned from them, &amp; skip all discussion of recent counterinsurgency tactics/campaigns *as actually applied.* this is bad generaling. h/t to @pstanpolitics.
@arzandc @thegrugq the US COIN reboot was an ahistoric, cherry-picked sell that ignored cold-blooded, purposefully painful approaches* recently used by other states. it doomed good people to ambushes/IEDs on soft-touch missions bound to fail. (*this tweet does not endorse collective punishment.)

@AJSikes_Author @jkass99 thank you
@MrPrussia @timmathews @_STODD if the army, with all of its small arms &amp; NCOs, can't manage its own pistol training, then it should not be a military service. a ~$600m cost for fielding 200k semi- pistols is a startling price tag, as many a private pistol owner (who fires more than soldiers) might agree.
@GeorgeWHerbert @_STODD if per unit cost is ~$320, then that's reasonable.  a break-out of the remaining &gt;$2500 per unit would be interesting to see.
@MrPrussia @timmathews @_STODD how much "new equipment training" is really required for a semi-automatic pistol?
@historicfirearm certain SALW *have* changed how wars are fought.  but pistols for the current US conventional forces? nope.  not at all.  might as well change road-guard vests.
@_STODD that must be some blue-ribbon training.  (and so much for the concept of wholesale, bulk-buying creating discounts.)
@historicfirearm when set against the larger context, this is an evergreen thought.
@Ronin_413 @Lkatzenberg or maybe paid a light-duty Marine to take the MCI, per SOP.
@_STODD I haven't taken an independent look at this program, but if the story's numbers are right, the USG is set to spend $580m for ~200k pistols, or a per unit cost approaching $3k?  Sounds like urinalysis time.

@livia_ar one result is the license-holder demographic is skewed toward older men. i haven't seen recent data but the old slide i saw on quahogging showed a super lopsided industry. almost looked geriatric (on paper).  not good.
@livia_ar we fish small-scale commercially in RI. the license dance drives people NUTS. multi-yr waits for anything valuable, lotteries w &gt;6x more applicants than licenses, hard conditions on transfers (even in families). meanwhile oyster farming has boomed. great product, eager customers.

@DanLamothe @wesleysmorgan @JournoGeoffZ @DefenseBaron MRAPs are a sign of an occupier who got really fucking stuck, and of commanders (understandably) more focused on protecting their troops than having an influence on their foes. put another way: a sign of a failed war, and of units stuck in puzzles their leaders can’t solve.

@DanLamothe @wesleysmorgan @JournoGeoffZ @DefenseBaron it’s your tweet not ours. either way, if senator is touting more kit into sasc open mic, what’s bad about talking about that kit?
@LMcDonald51 @DanLamothe @wesleysmorgan @JournoGeoffZ @DefenseBaron yep. easier to armor up, hunker down &amp; spend cash on briefable “solutions” than to work thru hard Qs. MRAPs appeared about same time commanders started regularly touting “tactical patience,” a euphemism understood by rank&amp;file as “don’t be last troop killed in this fucking war.”
@DanLamothe @wesleysmorgan @JournoGeoffZ @DefenseBaron when a sasc member is touting them, &amp; under discussion is delivery of 100s of vehicles — discussion is merited. the usg has dumped vast amounts of mismatched and labor-/parts-demanding equipment (&amp; lethal aid) into afg, much of which breaks/idles/goes missing. questions are good.
@DanLamothe @wesleysmorgan @JournoGeoffZ @DefenseBaron MRAPs reduced mobility; reliance on them made many US units *more* predictable. They were another marker of operational incoherence.

@RoyScranton @intensionality @JoePlenzler @MsgToObserver @iAmTheWarax @NYTimesAtWar We do this outreach almost every day &amp; we will bring these voices. My larger argument tho, and I say this often, is that one voice need not exclude another. And shouldn't. Bc no voice is complete. Every voice is likely biased and flawed, even when flaws or biases are invisible.
@RoyScranton @intensionality @JoePlenzler @MsgToObserver @iAmTheWarax I agree. But not every vet has that lens. So some of the burden for that lies w editors, not writers. And editors face hurdles. Hours before this twitter conversation, I asked an Iraqi to write for @NYTimesAtWar. He declined, so as not to bring attention to himself.
@intensionality @JoePlenzler @MsgToObserver @iAmTheWarax last, to @intensionality &amp; @RoyScranton, i'll offer apologies for trying this on twitter -- a lousy forum for complicated discussion, &amp; on which we can sound harsher than intended. face to face, in real (not digital) life, over coffee, given time, i suspect we'd agree on much.
@intensionality @JoePlenzler @MsgToObserver @iAmTheWarax meanwhile, some recent vet writing, while focused inward, underlines the futility, stupidity or casual criminality of certain US tactics, doctrines, decisions, programs, goals, &amp; the emotional or moral anguish of combatants. this has value. pls allow it a place in that mosaic.
@intensionality @JoePlenzler @MsgToObserver @iAmTheWarax I also don't expect Americans who served in Iraq/Afg, under conditions making it impossible for them to communicate freely w citizens whose nations they occupied, to be authorities or even powerful voices of Afg or Iraqi experiences. Very few can do that. A solution? More voices.
@intensionality @JoePlenzler @MsgToObserver @iAmTheWarax ..this is why i routinely tell readers to seek other sources beside American sources, &amp; to seek writers who are not male &amp; not Western &amp; not vets, &amp; to look for Iraqi and Afg perspectives (like' Frankenstein in Baghdad').
@intensionality @JoePlenzler @MsgToObserver @iAmTheWarax One of many tragedies in these wars is that many (most?) vets had little substantive interaction w Iraqi &amp; Afg civilians. Language &amp; cultural barriers, tactics, rules, security, violence &amp; racism combined to prevent it. People became scenery, puzzles or problems. So, yes....
@RoyScranton @intensionality @JoePlenzler @MsgToObserver @iAmTheWarax I’ve read your LARB essay &amp; agree w much of it.

@JakeGodin @MatthewRWallin @Tmgneff thank you for sending. the date of the attack (oct 2017), per reuters, makes more sense.  the vegetation did not look like helmand in feb or march....  thanks for the conversation. very interesting throughout.
@JakeGodin @MatthewRWallin @Tmgneff there appears to be a guard shack after that, too, at the last R turn, and driver passes through that swiftly. people seem to linger there after. and driver moves with confidence through each turn on his route. is there info on who driver was?
@MatthewRWallin @JakeGodin @Tmgneff i haven't researched (much less reconstructed) this attack, but is that a turreted vehicle?  and does it pass through a manned guard shack at bottom L of screen, where it takes its final R turn?  the driver clearly knows the way, too, through back road.  inside job?

@ExtremelyOkAcct @ahmadjavid That’s sound and fair criticism, and I accept it. I’m bad at twitter and its speedwriting.  Would have been better to say “every class of individual equipment.” Thanks for pointing to it.
@AdamDavechick @Tmgneff There are certainly ways to do this w electronics, including a transceiver to allow/relay remote disabling or require routine passcode updating etc. (A non-apprroved user would soon find NVGs would fail.) Unauthorized users could work around but it would be complicated 4 them.
@ahmadjavid Blame is complicated, but I’d place larger share on US officers, whose designs created Afghan security structures with unwise haste &amp; in ways that helped hardwire desertion- including pay so low that an issued rifle is worth more than a few months of an Afghan soldier’s wage.
@ahmadjavid Individual equipment issued to Afghan security forces leaks to Taliban. There’s a long history of this- weapons, ammunition, uniforms, etc, and (lately) night vision equipment. (Trucks too, though they are not for individual soldiers/officers.) This is not in serious dispute.
@ShoemakerMicah @bdentonphoto @Tmgneff Yes it’s obvious but the people and organizations that issue them need reminding.
Solid @Tmgneff here, further challenging Pentagon on the Afghan war.  (Free reminder: almost every item issued to Afghan soldiers ends up in Taliban hands. If US opts for wide issue of night-vision equipment, within months the Taliban will have even more). https://t.co/Za0ir0GS6o

@JABell27 @luke_j_obrien @AzmatZahra we should also warn ourselves re our language, bc it's slippery to assign an exclusively HUMINT label to UN's statement. that's much less than what UN said. it said nature of target was "widely divergent" from DOD's assessment &amp; real use of struck building was readily available.
@JABell27 @luke_j_obrien @AzmatZahra i wouldn't propose HUMINT as a sole or even primary input for balancing targeting/civcas prevention, as in, distinction.  it's potentially one strand. distinction can be thought of as a genuine, comprehensive effort at understanding a potential target, not one tool vs another.
@JABell27 @luke_j_obrien @AzmatZahra yes, you are right re early in the campaigns.  @wesleysmorgan and @derekgannoncm6 we're chatting about this last week.  thumbs up.
@luke_j_obrien The public gets little vis on deliberate targeting decisions. But there is evidence of deliberate strikes being done w thin pre-strike intel, and w confirmation bias in the targeting cell analysis. And Pentagon resists discussion, accountability. Cf, the Uncounted. @AzmatZahra
@luke_j_obrien Yes, TICs are different. That’s another conversation &amp; you’re right to put it another box. (And that gets hugely complicated depending on merits of the ground op, as in, at what point are the patrols themselves ill-conceived, and thus all the climbing risks questionable.)
@luke_j_obrien Another way to frame that Q is to turn it around: When is doubt enough?  When dropping a 500-pound bomb into a city, at what point are you really confident you have taken thorough, thoughtful steps to avoid harming civilians? What’s the standard for that drop if you lived there?
@luke_j_obrien Discrim capability feels closely tied to commanders &amp; command culture. It does not consistently chart better over time. It varies frm place to place, depending on factors that include more than tech capability. When distinction is lower priority, more civs die, no matter the tech
@luke_j_obrien You’ll get no hate from me for typos/mixups on twitter. This is a bad medium for conversation, and I make many more mistakes here than you do.
@luke_j_obrien Everyone gets that mistakes are part of war. They are an especially large part of war when an institution is checking boxes on complying w distinction (as has felt w some of the strikes examined in the campaign against ISIS) or when accountability seems more buzzword than fact.
@luke_j_obrien No argument. But let’s add layers to the mix. Militaries know if they show *process* to comply w principle of distinction they insulate themselves frm war-crime claims. Can this explain half-assed processes, like brief (low-value) UAV overflights as “pattern of life” assessments?
@luke_j_obrien Aren’t there two separate but related issues?  One is improving future targeting (which may require investment in pre-stike intel). The other is accountability. Hoping to do better next time does not excuse past mistakes.

@robin_washburn my point was that it's hard to compare AR-15 use in such crimes in 1965 to its use in 2018. there were few AR-15s in civ possession then. now they are widely owned. the weapon went from relative rarity to mass popularity. (thanks for civil discussion; hard to find on this topic.)
@shakespear88 @larthallor @mrs_pinky85 @Doug75280706 @alexburnsNYT M16/M4 follow in direct lineage from AR-15, which stoner designed for mil use. the history here is clear. the platform was first named AR-15 then renamed M16 during military procurement for vietnam. popularization of AR-15 as a label for civilian semi-only variants came later.
@robin_washburn i'm sorry if i was not clear. by ecosystem i meant the *social* ecosystems AR ownership back then and now are very different, not the central, underlying tech of the rifles' themselves.  sorry for the confusion.

@robin_washburn 1965 and 2018 are very different AR ecosystems. there were few AR-15s in public circulation in the 1960s. sales skyrocketed after federal ban tolled in 2004, which coincided w near fetishization of AR-15s w mil-style accessories, like those used by troops in afghanistan and iraq.
The AR-15 was designed for war, to optimize battlefield killing. Yes, civilian versions are semi only. But remember: the military trains its grunts to use AR-15 variants (renamed M16/ M4) on semi in most combat, too. And keeps their rifles locked up. https://t.co/Pli4FcYssI

@PeterLucier is it 1/1 or 1-1? 		and if it's 1-1 are you sure the first 1 is a battalion and not a squadron?(there are cav people here.)		purple is confusing, especially for vets.

@bgarrettglaser as a kid i remember my father, a vietnam vet, saying "best and brightest" with a sneering disgust. he still does.
@bgarrettglaser i see your point, and accept it. on the other hand, and maybe this is particular to people who have covered or participated in american wars, "best and brightest" rings as a knowing pejorative to me.  (cf, the use of the phrase during the mcnamara era.)

@jsargentr @ConorConneally you're both right.
@zacharyebell they’re so ready, and so thoughtfully deployed, that we’re going to withhold from you their desertion rate and casualty numbers.
@ConorConneally run in some cases by the same officers who on previous tours tried other ideas (the push up valleys in eastern &amp; northeastern afg, the helmand/rural kandahar “surge”) got a lot of troops and afghans killed, and failed.
@SMS1080 @ddale8 all the legs yet to be blown off. but don’t worry. they loosened the rules for airstrikes. they got this. just add more “pressure” and taliban will reconcile. (according to a proclaration literally beside a lockheed martin ad.)

this is an example of brass duping itself. inside a security bubble they put on shows for visiting cdrs &amp; pols, say their lines &amp; it becomes groupthink. the senior pilot (how many rural afghans have you met? how many patrols have you walked?) declaring “i’m a believer” is  dope.

@RealSteveJoe @RadioFreeTom @MarkHertling again, one action does not exclude the other. i'd wager that emergency management officials across a spectrum of agencies and levels are looking at this closely for that very reason. (and the HI officials' early statements were good examples of officials owning a mistake.)
@RadioFreeTom @soonergrunt @MarkHertling @algcolvin informal networks are a mixed bag for sure (&amp; not always terrible). but they are nearly omnipresent &amp; they matter &amp; when accurate info moves on them that's not a bad thing. centralized, official comm models don't stand alone, no matter their handlers' desires or good intentions
@RadioFreeTom @MarkHertling i'm talking about the idea of sharing accurate information in a fast-moving crisis, not about rep gabbard per se or her politics, which are fair grounds for (as are any pol's) whatever criticisms the public wishes to bring.
@RadioFreeTom @soonergrunt @MarkHertling @algcolvin In panicked situations information moves many ways, per your 100 yelling people, which is why mass communication can depend on (and try to capitalize on) informal networks for amplification. I don't see the foul here, except in theory.
@soonergrunt @RadioFreeTom @MarkHertling @algcolvin autoinjector to heart would be peak twitter for sure. all the more reason to be basically okay with any *accurate* relaying of a false alarm.
@soonergrunt @RadioFreeTom @MarkHertling @algcolvin i decided not to say that.
@RadioFreeTom @MarkHertling @algcolvin but this one was not anything like that complicated. it was: hey, false alarm. and it was right. the theoretical substitutions are missing that.
@RadioFreeTom @MarkHertling @algcolvin "I have a bucket of water and you're on fire, Tom, but I'll hold off because there is a fire department somewhere and I believe in the man."  I see your points but the Gabbard tweet is not your best supporting example.
@Truth2Pwer The pee-in-wetsuit joys around here are complicated, given that my oldest son now fits in my suits... (A lucky problem to have. Pura Vida, HNY and offshores back.)
@Truth2Pwer (Sorry for mangled syntax. Working on uncooperative wood stove while tweeting...)
@Truth2Pwer There are have some pretty good waves here for a few days. Not sure about Montauk but yeah when the wind swung north that south side there might have been nice.
@Truth2Pwer when nuclear warfare comes let it find me with surfers.
@MarkHertling @RadioFreeTom @algcolvin One action need not exclude the other. If my family and I are taking action under a lethal threat and you give me an accurate heads-up that it’s a false alarm, call me crazy but I’d think youd did us a solid and I’d consider you a credit to the general-officer class.
@MarkHertling @RadioFreeTom @algcolvin You are dead right here. It’s just the Gabbard tweet is not the right example.
@MarkHertling @RadioFreeTom @algcolvin If you found out that it was a false alarm and shared it you’d be a stand-up guy, and anyone who acted on your info and was relieved of risky behavior or fear might thank you. If it were my state, and my family, I would.
@MarkHertling @RadioFreeTom @algcolvin When an entire state is officially informed that it is under a missile attack, everyone in that state or closely connected to it is in the event. The “crowded theater” holds millions of people. The authorities’ failure forced, and invited, participation, some if it helpful.
@RadioFreeTom @MarkHertling @algcolvin This isn’t the best example of your points. A false story was flashed into population by govt, w instant saturation. There was no immediate correction. Having seen unofficial initiative save many lives, I accept it as a feature of crises and this as not the example to pounce on.
@Bgug1953 @MarkHertling There are good examples and bad examples of unofficial people stepping into crises. It’s not binary.  I understand the retired general’s point. I accept it’s good intentions. But its implied message chills. Relaying true, helpful and calming info in a panic is not scold worthy.
@MarkHertling @algcolvin People who are “not part of the event” are part of the event. That’s reality, commonly seen in accidents, fires, terror acts, med emergencies, firefights etc. The authorities are often late, or wrong. Expect human beings to cover gaps, often helpfully. Thank them when they do.
@MarkHertling I’m not following you. She had true information and a method of relaying it. Why discourage sharing it?

@CarlPrinetweets @wesleysmorgan @Raphaeleads But Bronze Star.
@wesleysmorgan @Raphaeleads Yeah the thinking behind big ops did not reflect that insurgenting is for many participants part-time work. When conventionals turned out heavy, their foes had only to put down rifles and tend herds, cut wood, stand around bazaars, check crops, wrench trucks.  Or anything else.
@wesleysmorgan @Raphaeleads And: “activity equals accomplishment and accomplishment equals end of tour awards and promotions and opportunities for more.” It’s a flawed system, one that penalizes study and restraint and thoughtful approaches to produce action and attitude and slogan over real security.
@Raphaeleads @wesleysmorgan Oh don’t get me started. I have plans for the day.
@Raphaeleads @wesleysmorgan Yes it did seem as if the FARPs used by Pale Horse and other aviation task forces were watched and thoroughly understood, and insurgent ground actions were sometimes synced to known response times and refuel/rearm sequences. (Cf the mortar attacks on FARPs as aircraft used them.)
@wesleysmorgan Btw, unrelated style q, to a Kunar scholar. You use Watapur not Wattapur, or some other transliteration?

@DanLamothe @DionNissenbaum @Tmgneff Marines also paid farmers to burn their poppy crops. Some farmers agreed &amp; burned the crops *after* the harvest.  USG might as well have burned the cash. But those powerpoint "poppy fields burned" slides looked good, and I bet the organizers' Navy Commendation Medals look snazzy.
@ScottCFarquhar @Tmgneff @JHAYSmoney20 all the time. there was much engagement w afghans on this, which is one reason USG balked. people found the economy was much more complicated than the "poppy is the engine of the insurgency" line, and solutions that sounded good on powerpoint did not apply well in field.
@DionNissenbaum @Tmgneff You are right about many units, incl Marine units in Helmand, conceding that counterpoppy was not a priority. Away from brass some of them also conceded they simply could not take it on aggreessively bc it would spur fighting at a scale they were unready for, &amp; was anti-COIN.
@dixondaver @Tmgneff @JHAYSmoney20 Score?  I ran out of characters but was trying to finish w that same thought with a unit of death at a different order of magnitude than score.
@Tmgneff @JHAYSmoney20 The US Afghan effort has been a long line of good idea fairies, often w each officer touting an angle/program/doctrine/rule/new piece of kit without much regard to the other good idea fairies and their big new things. It’s like a bad movie about excited vacuum cleaner salesmen.
@DionNissenbaum NATO and the Afghan govt, along with various US commanders and units and arms of govt, never were coherent on the counternarcotic/poppy piece. It was a confused shitshow. But saying going after poppy is new or took 16 years isn’t accurate.

@chadgarland @wesleysmorgan @G_Trowbridge @Tmgneff yes that's what drew me to comment re fmr secdef's piece. the idea that it was reporters who didn't grasp dangers when WH winked at them.
@G_Trowbridge @wesleysmorgan @chadgarland @Tmgneff i have no animus 2 u. i don't think we've met. but obama messaging was bad. iraq is at war &amp; US is in it. this needs attention not euphemism
@wesleysmorgan @chadgarland @G_Trowbridge @Tmgneff Yes, better for US &amp; Iraqi ears, across board. Speaking directly and consistently would have eased the mutual frustration, and eye-rolling.
@G_Trowbridge @wesleysmorgan @Tmgneff that'd exasperate me too. but dumb Qs are part of back/forth, esp when info is limited. (&amp; that Q indicates press actively querying re risk)
@wesleysmorgan @G_Trowbridge @Tmgneff at this point most iraqis have no illusions about the labels.
@wesleysmorgan @G_Trowbridge @Tmgneff that's some fine mediation, wes. well said. i'd add tho it's weird to 1) soft-pedal mission in messaging &amp;  2) say press didn't grasp risks
@G_Trowbridge @Tmgneff and this was in the practice, after a KIA: "This was an individual who was not in a combat mission, but he was in a dangerous place."
@wesleysmorgan @charlie_simpson @Tmgneff and no off-switch in DC.
@G_Trowbridge @Tmgneff there was no misunderstanding here re risks. circular admin statements didn't seem dishonest as much as tortured, lame &amp; disrespectful.

RT @MarinePAO: Good to go, Lt! https://t.co/3m0KYPaLyE
@peter_j_munson @JoePlenzler anyhow good night to you peter. sorry to have angered you. i did not mean to. and for record: i wish the new Lt every success. bye for now.
@peter_j_munson @JoePlenzler not what i said. sorry for being unclear. usmc can release. i'd argue it's required to. but it can resist if it wants, then court compels.
@peter_j_munson @JoePlenzler i think, based on past practice/experience w releases, there is a requirement to release, but i recognize nothing short of court compels it.
@peter_j_munson @JoePlenzler What I meant: if USMC breaks w practice/policy, then nothing compels it, unless issues go to court. But moot here bc name will leak first.
@peter_j_munson @JoePlenzler @OGTommyP @USMC The @Marinetimes/PX fiasco was bad chapter, for sure.
@peter_j_munson @OGTommyP @JoePlenzler @USMC the word "compels" throws me. i mean, nothing short of court order often "compels" DOD/services to release public info.
@peter_j_munson @JoePlenzler did i? sorry if i was not clear. (again: 140s). if name is public record than that's grounds (your word, "compels" stumps me) for release.
@OGTommyP @peter_j_munson @JoePlenzler @USMC sorry i am bad at twitter. i am trying to reply to the tweets as i see them but there are many and i'm messing up. apologies.
@peter_j_munson @JoePlenzler @OGTommyP @USMC so when you speak of any biases in this conversation maybe i do have a bias there. The Ranger School example maybe colors my take.
@peter_j_munson @JoePlenzler @OGTommyP @USMC As someone who watched the Ranger School graduations unfold (&amp; I'm a Ranger grad) I thought institution &amp; grads alike handled that well.
@peter_j_munson @JoePlenzler @OGTommyP @USMC ...the smart PA play might be to look at  Ranger School example &amp; take lessons from it. Name was released, grads laid low, big win for all.
@peter_j_munson @JoePlenzler @OGTommyP @USMC aside from any policy/past practice tho is practical piece. name is going to get out. &amp; no one has anything to be ashamed of here, so...
@peter_j_munson @JoePlenzler @OGTommyP @USMC that's been my experience. but again, i'm citing regs or speaking as a sea lawyer here, so am open to other views or examples.
@peter_j_munson @JoePlenzler @OGTommyP @USMC and the info at a unit historian's binder, in a units S-3 shop, which includes names in billets etc, is also public record.
@peter_j_munson @JoePlenzler @OGTommyP @USMC there are exceptions obviously re med info, but i'm not sensing med info here. a school roster at an UCLAS school is FOIA easy, right?
@peter_j_munson @JoePlenzler @OGTommyP @USMC thus, names of members on UNCLAS duty in UNCLAS units are releasable, and generally, in my experience, are released.
@peter_j_munson @JoePlenzler @OGTommyP @USMC my sense re policy 7 past practice, and i may be wrong and am open to being corrected, is that UNCLAS service does not come w anonymity.
@peter_j_munson @JoePlenzler @OGTommyP @USMC so let me try in parts, and forgive the mangled syntax and cut-off sentences in advance, pls.
@peter_j_munson @JoePlenzler @OGTommyP @USMC sorry, 140s tripping me up. keep running out of space.  (this is a crap forum for this, plus i'm bad at it.)
@peter_j_munson @JoePlenzler @OGTommyP @USMC you're having an argument with points i was not making. again: i agree w u on her position. she can keep that stance forever, even if named.
@peter_j_munson @JoePlenzler @OGTommyP @USMC i was replying to joe re "triggering." i'm not into the insults or assumptions on motives. was talking solely about release of name.
@TroopsinContact @coffeeshopjihad @JoePlenzler @USMC i can't speak to that w my state of knowledge, so have to pass.
@JoePlenzler @peter_j_munson @OGTommyP @USMC i'd rather not get into personal stuff here, if that's cool. it's an interesting issue, &amp; a puzzle. i'm rather stay in the issue's lane.
@peter_j_munson @JoePlenzler @OGTommyP @USMC why the swearing man? and again: what says she has to go on CNN? she doesn't.
@peter_j_munson @JoePlenzler @OGTommyP @USMC but, if i may: the idea that her name is UNCLAS and a matter of record = anyone asserting that wants her to fail? that's strawman stuff.
@peter_j_munson @JoePlenzler @OGTommyP @USMC i don't have a dog in the fight but find it odd that usmc would hold back the name in defiance of past practice, and when clearly untenable.
@coffeeshopjihad @TroopsinContact @JoePlenzler @USMC me neither but i listen to @troopsincontact so am trying to
@peter_j_munson @JoePlenzler @OGTommyP @USMC but you're conflating "name" w interviews on CNN/NYT. they're not the same thing. name on CNN, followed by "declined intvu" is what's likely
@peter_j_munson @JoePlenzler @OGTommyP @USMC i'm plenty dense. it's often good bc then people splain everything for me.
@peter_j_munson @JoePlenzler @OGTommyP @USMC she already gets cred for trying to duck the attention. &amp; she can keep ducking it when named.  her unit and marines will see that, too.
@peter_j_munson @JoePlenzler @OGTommyP @USMC we're getting past what we can do in 140s, so my apologies for that. but "hated it" re attn is not policy or legal standard for public info
@peter_j_munson @JoePlenzler @OGTommyP @USMC that's part of what is odd here. name will come either way. the ranger example shows you can release name, graduate sets boundaries, done
@peter_j_munson @JoePlenzler @OGTommyP @USMC i'm listening but struggling w yr sense that the name = spectacle.  ranger school handled this well. release name, graduate sets media tempo
@peter_j_munson @JoePlenzler @OGTommyP @USMC i completely agree re interviews.  those are hers to choose or decline. she never has to do one. entirely her call.
@peter_j_munson @JoePlenzler @OGTommyP @USMC what's that mean, "dot?" am curious. don't understand it.
@TroopsinContact @JoePlenzler @USMC i think so too. i'm not sure @usmc is doing her a solid by backing it. it's 1) untenable and 2) out of the usual practice, so, preferential.
@JoePlenzler @AlisaWiles @USMC i'm not reading policy here so won't pretend to be, but this has been the practice i am familiar  from both my @usmc &amp; journalism lives.
@JoePlenzler @OGTommyP @USMC by holding the name back @usmc adds a drama neither it nor the new Lt needs.
@JoePlenzler @OGTommyP @USMC it feels @usmc is making this a bigger issue than it has to be. she's a marine. she succeeded. she's going to fleet. get on w it.
@AlisaWiles @JoePlenzler @USMC i didn't follow every twist/turn of first female rangers, but names were released, they kept low profile &amp; have been quietly impressive.
@OGTommyP @JoePlenzler @USMC agree. &amp; in a weird way granting a wish of anonymity could put more pressure &amp; sense of protection on Lt. release &amp; make it less of a deal.
@AlisaWiles @JoePlenzler @USMC &amp; even if it did who thinks name won't move anyhow? smart PA play is brief it basic background &amp; express her wishes to be undisturbed. done.
@AlisaWiles @JoePlenzler @USMC i completely respect her position. she has every right to decline interviews, focus on MOS. but her UNCLAS service does not grant anonymity.
@OGTommyP @JoePlenzler @USMC i respect her v USMC attitude. but names are matter of public record. &amp; this is going to get out, smarter to be ahead than behind.
@AlisaWiles @JoePlenzler @USMC corps is on thin ice fighting this &amp; will lose anyhow. release the name, underline her desire to focus on training &amp; MOS work, be done w it
@AlisaWiles @JoePlenzler @USMC when a person joins @usmc he/she enters public service &amp; the public domain. name of an officer in a nonclassified job is a matter of record.

@TarMilus @KingstonAReif @anadoluagency @orko_8 the results are familier. enormous qties of lethal kit changed hands, to be used by everyone from isis to state-aligned militias &amp; others
@TarMilus @KingstonAReif @anadoluagency @orko_8 many of us met people doing handouts. they were mid-career members of military, with vast sums to disburse and bosses pushing them to rush.
@TarMilus @KingstonAReif @anadoluagency @orko_8 among them are haste w which arming decisions are often made &amp; executed, often by people/orgs not qualified/interested in longview analysis.
@TarMilus @KingstonAReif @anadoluagency @orko_8 i can't vouch for 2nd sentence but problem outlined in 1st sentence has many roots.
@klkamashiq thank you. "hez-derivative" flag. same point: much of the mil equipment from usg to iraq passed (in a strategic blink) to unintended hands.
@TarMilus @KingstonAReif @anadoluagency @orko_8 Exactly. One consistent theme in the wars is that as outsiders flow weapons to them the weapons 1) alarm allies 2) change hands or 3) both.
@alikhedery yes, per earlier exchange today, issue is perennial &amp; evergreen. has long clear roots that govt barely acknowledges, even as it ships more.
@alikhedery point re US arms/equipment handouts (&amp; training, too) is same: It migrated, quickly &amp; at vast scale, to unintended recipients, incl foes.
@catmidnite @NataliaAntonova ...&amp; no one alert would argue that USG &amp; Shiite groups have not had interests both clash &amp; align in the rabbit hole the Pentagon dove down.
@JoelNewburn @TroopsinContact I'd buy that book. And read it, probably repeatedly.  Please write it.
@undertoad80 All good. Happens. (Twitter reply feature is chaotic, seems badly designed.) Thx re GUN. Will have another book, 2018. Hope you like it too.
@undertoad80 Ahh, okay. Then maybe @ that somewhere else, like @ the pub or writer involved?
@undertoad80 My tweet was about the access-to-PAO quote from DOD PA shop. Isn't that what you replied to? (Sorry; genuinely confused)
@undertoad80 Not following you. The pentagon-press thing is often strained, by nature. But asserting that access to PAOs is "access" is an odd argument.
@catmidnite @NataliaAntonova wherever one stands on the dif militias &amp; their alignments/motives, the point holds: the USG's weapons &amp; equipment handouts went astray.
@TroopsinContact no argument there. my point is about the larger plans (read: fantasies) drafted at the top.
@TroopsinContact instead what happened was too fast, too big, too dreamy. meanwhile sf/ic regularly looted ansf of budding ncos, ensuring ansf foundered.
@TroopsinContact I'm not a SF groupie (who among fmr jarheads is?) but i'd like to think they would have approached the ansf grow-out more realistically.
@TroopsinContact yep they were distributed nationally. rangers too. to me issue wasn't trucks per se but quantity. USG dreams outran realistic ansf capacity.
@TroopsinContact part of that is also where ANSF was assigned w trucks. in canyon outposts in outer nuristan? useless. hardly used them, after driving in.
@TroopsinContact they're are a lot of ways to look at this, and that's valid, tactically. we could riff on the issues the lost equipment raises all day....

@get_it_maggie It's a puzzle that screams for data &amp; sound analysis. All of us have first-hand experience here, and hunches. But we may be wrong on scale.
@thecla923 @bhierman Also, would be interesting to chart retirees and where they settle, &amp; to see how state of record lines up at diferent strata at ranks
@thecla923 @bhierman Yes majority is certainly non southern but i wonder if "southern" (however defined) is disproportionately repped.
@get_it_maggie And yes, social pressure not to serve can be powerful in upscale zip codes and schools. Attitude is sometimes: That's for others not for us.
@get_it_maggie agree. &amp; not arguing. but have been many periods when privileged citizens dodged, from civil war to vietnam. cough cough clinton, trump.
@bhierman this a rich theme to explore bc recruiting effort is nationally distributed but many large bases and mil retiree clusters are southern.

@BWJones the ithaca gun factory; haven't seen it in forever. used to run that hill, training for usmc, &amp; cast for fall-run landlocks in stream below.
@BWJones that line is easy on my ears but our 410 is inelegant. It's a long-lived tool, exactly what's needed when needed, like a 9/16 socket wrench.
much gun coverage, by both pro- &amp; anti- pubs, is re militarized firearms, or handguns. we'd do well to talk more about .410s and their ilk.
[i meant *turkeys* not *turkey's* so please just insert my standard pro-copy editor chant right here]
we even used it to collect (okay, that's euphemism( escaped domestic turkey's one fall, when we couldn't get them back to their feed.
it's low punch, short range &amp; single shot is IDEAL. you consider each shot fully, which is what firearms use (except suppression) is about
i've used it off and on for 35+ years, for rabbits, a few squirrels and the occasional gamebird. it's more beat up than on old truck.
i have a great aunt's old .410. it was her rat gun on a farm. family lore is she used it out a second-story window, back in the day.

@MarkSZaidEsq @arawnsley @DLoesch it definitely has a weird feel but the "fist" claim is distraction. she said that they'd challenge stories line by line. that's fair ball.
@arawnsley is this where you start in w lines from JAWS?
@arawnsley i'm barefoot today thanks
@MarkSZaidEsq @arawnsley @DLoesch just checked @DLoesch's timeline. she says it was "fisk," like it looks &amp; sounds. it was her script. i believe her on this point. [end]
@MarkSZaidEsq @arawnsley the lip-read thing (we hearing-impaireds get good at that) also suggests @DLoesch said fisk, not fist. she'd know too. it was her script.
@MarkSZaidEsq @arawnsley i put in my hearing aids (don't hear so well w/o them) and sounded like "fisk" to me.
@Dcwriley @Tmgneff @PaulSzoldra @PeterLucier @DuffelBlog it happened to someone i know who will remain nameless but ask around &amp; you'll find in some matters i am impervious to learning. so, fair q.

@taengi322 @soonergrunt @PaulSzoldra aint bad mojo what's left? and to be channeled?
@taengi322 @soonergrunt @PaulSzoldra and brochures of op-eds by COIN proponents, who just dined with generals, telling you how smart the generals and how great it's going.
@jacksondwhit pleasure.  (now keep writing.)
@taengi322 @PaulSzoldra lots of civilians loitering and looking at you angrily and signs telling you to befriend them even if your car blows up as you drive away
@PaulSzoldra Make sure the pit has an eternal *burn pit* plume and a lot or senior people saying don't worry that's nothing to worry about
