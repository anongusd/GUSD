“Don’t you think that all your fellow members of Congress when they vote on whether to go to war, don’t you think they should have kids in the military and that would influence their decision?” - @BonnieErbe 		Your thoughts?
“At some level [it is] hard to say logically that a woman should be Commander in Chief of the United States and yet she’s not even eligible for the draft.” - @LaraMBrownPHD #WomenAndTheDraft #Women2020
Should women be included in the draft?  @ChavezLinda brings up a past poll: "Women who were commissioned officers in the military wanted combat positions opened up to them. Women who were not commissioned, who were just a GI essentially did not.”
“The ERA is applied to the idea of #reproductivejustice or reproductive equality. It could be used to expand abortion laws to like what we’re seeing in Virginia and New York in which effectively third trimester abortion...is made legal.”  - @TianaTheFirst #ERA #Abortion
.@EleanorNorton says she is against the #draft, but in favor of having a selective service system that includes men and women. https://t.co/Cy7onpgQT9
“The Constitution is pretty gender neutral. The word person is used throughout the Constitution with the exception of voting.” - @ChavezLinda		Will adding a few words push the ERA forward?
“The most salient argument, the one that was used when we were in the streets trying to get the ERA is unintended consequences.” Del @EleanorNorton #ERA
“If someone like Sen. Amy Klobuchar were able to come in and define the fact that a Democrat can just be a temperate, sane, liberal counterpoint to the insanity and the bells and whistles of the Trump administration, she could have a real shot.” - @TianaTheFirst #Women2020
We should keep the selective service and keep the option of a #draft open in case of an emergency situation like another World War, argues @TianaTheFirst https://t.co/ZJJhDWaxro
Can Trump be beat? “Historically speaking, an embattled incumbent typically wins reelection.” - @LaraMBrownPHD #Women2020
“Medicare For All. I can give you a half dozen varieties of Medicare for All. I hope that we break that down, so that we who are Democrats don’t just hand the Republicans, not a talking point, but perhaps [a weapon].”  - Del @EleanorNorton #Women2020

"There is still a lot of work that the Democratic party has to do, but in exchange for the votes of women of color, has to come power and real leadership and a place at the decision making table and that’s where I think 2018 is going to be a real difference maker." @DonnaFEdwards
"The fact that 4% of black women voted for Trump tells you a lot about the work we would have to do to get more African American women to engage in the Republican party and we are never going get to where we need to go as long as the environment doesn’t facilitate it." - @Higs118
"Right now when we think about women running for office we have Hillary Clinton on one end and more socially conservative women on the other end. We do not think about men that way. We do not think about just the extremes. We have all of these men in the middle." - @SL_Schaeffer
"Women won’t achieve parity unless Republican women come more in a fold, because you cannot have a situation where the only women that are essentially representing all of the country are only Democratic women, that just won’t work." - @LaraMBrownPhD
"Baby steps is getting more Republican women elected to congress and in federal office and engaged in policy and I think the next step would be getting more minority women." @Higs118
"It is terrible, it is disgusting, and I do not like hearing any of it. It should also open our eyes to the larger conversation in which public figures are saying all sorts of terrible things and acting in a bad way towards women, it goes beyond party lines." - @SL_Schaeffer
"A lot of Democratic women say “I want to give some money to other women”, whereas Republican women say “I want to give to the candidate”, and that’s not necessarily a woman." - @LaraMBrownPhD on donating to other female politicians
"One of the things that’s going to happen on November 6 is we’re going to see what that gender gap really is and I believe that the president’s language, his constant demeaning of women is going to play out in this election and we’re going to see some of that " - @DonnaFEdwards
"This does enable men who already have this kind of attitude towards women to use this kind of language freely and openly, but I would also say that there’s a flip side that’s helping more women to have this kind of conversation with men about how horrific it is" - @LaraMBrownPhD
"There are a lot of Republicans who are turned off by the kind of language we hear out of the White House but hopefully we can think as individuals and not just as a party." @SL_Schaeffer
.@BonnieErbe says the @GOP took into consideration the visual aspect when @senatorCollins gave her #Kavanaugh speech https://t.co/weZU2t8Cj2
Well I think increasingly the views that the president’s holds on women have been baked in to where women are, which is why you see more Republican women, independent women, and certainly Democratic women leaning more towards Democrats and against Trump. - @DonnaFEdwards
"You are seeing thanks to the President a hardening of discourse in this country. Whether it relates to women or whether it is just the byproduct of the environment we are in, he is contributing to the diminished role that women are seen as in culture."- Jennifer Higgins @Higs118

“Binge-eating disorder is the most common disorder, but it’s the least talked about, it’s the newest eating-disorder diagnosis in the DSM-5, and yet, it is 2.5 times more prevalent than anorexia and bulimia combined,” explains @KaraRWhitely on binge-eating disorder.
“We see this  a little bit in the private sector and diet industry, the pivot from appearance to wellness. Weight Watchers changed its name for a reason. It is in response to the culture shifting and I think it is right that the culture is shifting.” @aliceblloyd @weeklystandard
“After all the health complications I had after becoming a mom, I am so lucky to have my health, why am I thinking about that waist I had? My body has done such amazing things since.” Says @AnushayHossain on body image and overall health.
. @BonnieErbe posses questions on the balance between body positivity and wellness, “Is it right to say ‘you look beautiful?’ Or should you say ‘make sure you are healthy’ and ‘go to a doctor, get checked, see how you are doing’ and work to make your health the main point?”
. @RinaInDC says that the idea of have the perfect body has been thrown in our faces for years. Do you agree? #TheWeightofBeing https://t.co/h5WxOLOeQs
This week @EleanorNorton adds to the discussion surrounding the #bodypositiv movement, saying, “This is a movement that has to grow, and it’s got to be led by women, and if they get out in front with it, they can succeed but that will take TV and Hollywood years.”
Do you think #RoeVWade will be overturned? @BonnieErbe weighs in. Watch the rest of the show to see how the panel answered. https://t.co/r9CeuV6Pc4
“What Conservatives want from more restrictions has always been not to abolish abortion but to let the states legislate it. Restrictions on abortion coming from the supreme court absent an overturn of Roe have the same effect at the state level,” @aliceblloyd @weeklystandard
Del. @EleanorNorton on the message the GOP is sending out to voters. https://t.co/sxhiRIA56z
“I always explain the news to my daughter. But with this story I kept it away because I did not want that idea to enter her head that if you come forward not only will people not believe you, the President of the United States could mock you,” @AnushayHossain on Kavanaugh hearing
Will Kavanaugh overturn #RoevWade? “There is just evidence in his background that says he is not the type and I am going to leave it right there. He’s got a mixed bag of opinions but I really do think that he sees it as precedent and he does not want to over turn that,” @RinainDC

“I agree with @juliekkohler1 people want to see a bold movement and a bold  change and I think whoever brings that, in that district will be the winner.”  - @JoOusterhout #ProgressiveDems
“Black support for (President) Trump is rising.” - @AEWS
“The issues may be right, but the solutions that the left is bringing are wrong, particularly socialist.” - @PatricePinkFile
“ @RepMaxineWaters speaks to a particular energy around the Democratic Party...what I look at is what Julie (Kohler) was discussing. What do people care about and what used to be “left” a long time ago really is not, it is mainstream.”  - @DonnaFEdwards
"I think that Maxine Waters was stepping up  into a position of rightful and appropriate critique of this administration. I think that we need to really stand behind our leaders that stand up for the values that are supposedly espoused by the Democratic party.” -@JulieKKohler1
“For the Hollywood women, everybody has kind of come out of the closet (about sexual harassment) - they’ve shared their experience, but is the women who- don’t have that platform there continuing to get the support they need?” - @PatricePinkFile
“Why is the guy in Kentucky running for office again? Why didn’t the women of Kentucky say he’s been reprimanded by an ethics committee? Why is he still in politics?” - @BonnieErbe on the #MeToo movement possibly fizzling.
“If somebody had the background of being fairly, I won’t say misogynistic, but at least had that aura was not as unexpected versus the ones that always put themselves out as the paragon of virtue when it comes to women-two different things.” - @Aews
“ The ultimate check on the (#MeToo movement) is going to be on the viewers and advertisers in television and film, come back with (the accused). It’s going to be voters who are going to say yes to that guy who had to step away under that controversy.” - @DonnaFEdwards
“A lot of people don’t just vote based of the President alone, they vote based off of what is happening in their district and the issues that are important to them.”   - @PatricePinkFile
“Stacey (Abrams) appeals to independent voters. There are a lot of independent voters and white women who are moving away from (Brian) Kemp because he is far over to the right. - @JoOusterhout
“A Democrat told me a couple of weeks ago that the House districts are all gerrymandered and really, Democratic women are running- even though they got the nomination, they’re running in districts that were written by state lawmakers to elect Republicans.”  - @BonnieErbe
“Republicans have 31 governorships for a reason. We’ve been found by people in most states to be very competent as executives at the state level and it hasn’t nothing to do with (President) Trump.” - @AEWS
“Don’t count (Stacey Abrams) out, its a red state, but a lot of people who haven’t voted before, who are mobilized- Michelle Lujan Grisham in New Mexico, Kate Brown in Oregon, these are women who can run and win these elections." - @DonnaFEdwards
. @PatricePinkFile says the #MeToo movement has not fizzled out but it may not be a top issue for the midterm elections #politics https://t.co/LE5ISRq8HE

Has Hollywood become more inclusive? New data proves that it hasn't. "Is this a chicken or an egg thing?"- @debracarnahan https://t.co/oOmQmcCjhr
Hollywood has made no progress for diversity, but at least there's Hillary, says host @BonnieErbe "@HillaryClinton has a deal to do a story with Steven Spielberg...but she is the rare woman who has access to people like that.”
“The issue with Hollywood is they feel like one hashtag is enough or one ‘year of the woman’ is enough. They don’t understand that we are the majority of the market, and we want to see ourselves reflected in our films.” -@AnushayHossain #DiversityinHollywood
. @RinainDC on how the #MeToo movement is giving women a voice. https://t.co/MLFfliyW0w
“The people at the top really don’t subscribe to #diversity. That’s been the talk for a long time, but when we see movements try to elicit change and fail - take Les Moonves for example - we know that there isn’t real change happening." -@RinainDC
With Hollywood's failure to increase diversity, @PatricePinkFile is thankful for TV: “If you’re tired of seeing just one type of script, one type of storyline with just one type of character, then you’re going to be drawn to Netflix, Amazon Prime, to all these other sources.”
“At @IWV, we did a poll and asked, what’s most important. #1: gender was not a determining factor for how women vote. #2: all issues are women’s issues, and that’s what a majority said.” -@PatricePinkFile
@PatricePinkFile on the possible unintended consequences of the #EMPOWERAct https://t.co/3eYaqYXT56
@debracarnahan is thrilled to see #MeToo trickling down from Hollywood to those who don't have "the celebrity wow factor.” Find the full discussion at https://t.co/nswuumWPCY
On Jane Fonda teaming up with farm and domestic workers against workplace harassment, host @BonnieErbe asks our panelists:  “Is this the synergy that is needed to get the #MeToo movement to trickle down to the women in the worst situations, who don’t have a voice?”
Is the GOP losing white women voters? @AunushayHossain says yes, and its because of the POTUS' actions. https://t.co/J4FacTcAgW
Anushay Hossain says it doesn't help to blame the parents of migrant children forced to go to work: “I was born and raised in Bangladesh. When you have a starvation rate of over 50%, everyone in your house has to work, because it’s about starvation, survival, and death.”
“The problem we’ll see... is that Democrats paint women as a monolith &amp; they assume the women’s vote is a liberal monolith. And truly, when you look back at 2016, Trump female voters had more in common with white, male Trump voters [than with Democratic-voting women].” -@RinaInDC
. @BonnieErbe on the way women vote in comparison to men. https://t.co/T2FJUhNnXs
“@TheDemocrats' strategy for getting [college educated white women] is to talk with them with respect, to point out the problems that have arisen with this administration: stripping women of their reproductive rights, the attitude toward women, equal pay." -@DebraCarnahan

Here's what @SL_Schaeffer likes about @CollegeBoundDot #FromPrisontoCollege https://t.co/fg8gTa9svK
. @EleanorNorton on offering former inmates and gang members college scholarships: “It’s important that the private sector has started this, but because of its success, and it looks like it’s having success, the government ought to say, ‘We want in.’” @CollegeBoundDot
"Working mothers are working everywhere. I thin this is just an extension of that, that we're seeing women now run for Congress with their children. I think it's a good thing and I think it's not a bad thing to shake up Congress a little bit." - @SL_Schaeffer
. @CarrollBeyer says work done by groups such as @CollegeBoundDot, which helps young people get a college education, has a multi-generational effect https://t.co/p3ggnd74UX
"My hope is that some of the advances in policy we've seen in the private sector ensure to government, to Congress, if some of these women, young women especially, are in a position to contribute to the dialogue surrounding universal child care and paid family leave." - @Higs118

“Sports, I have to say, especially today, is riddled with politics...to not have that intersection play out at some point is just unrealistic.” - @latifalyles on @jemelehill confronting the politics in sports

“Trump has a very clear pattern of really not liking... when people ... women &amp; w.o.c. (criticize him). Speaking out on such a political issue &amp; then having the president attack you &amp; then being suspended from your work - I have a lot of respect for her. - @AnushayHossain
“There’s a big power-push going on in the party right now. I think we’re, in many ways, still recovering and having an identity crisis from the election, and it’s important that [Ocasio-Cortez] is re-galvanizing the party on things that we need to focus on.” - @AnushayHossain
“What concerns me is that [Ocasio-Cortez] is a socialist...and you’re going to see...[the Democrats] moving to the left. There was a stat that said the majority of people under 30 don’t believe in capitalism.”  -Jennifer Higgins @Higs118 on what Ocasio-Cortez means for Democrats
. @Ocasio2018's campaign shook the table. Is the face of the Democratic party changing?  “When [far left’s policies] are illuminated by GOP ads, it’s going to be a real problem for them. But just the internal battle they have on the Dem. side is not helpful for them.” - @aews

.@BonnieErbe: I remember African history and African American History classes started springing up in college in the 70’s, why is there that gap in grade schools?
. @SistahScholar: I don’t believe there is a desire in this country to teach the truth about history, I believe that is true in the north, and the south, and the east, and the west.
. @latifalyles: It’s almost a hidden truth, it’s something we hear about and read it, it’s on page 25 of our textbooks of children, and then we swallow it and keep moving on.
. @PatricePinkFile : There are other unintended consequences that actually have a backlash against women, Sheryl Sandberg, CEO of Facebook talked about this, which is men are going to feel like they are not able to be around young women in particular
. @Higs118: I think the fact that unions are mobilizing are a positive sign, I think it gives these women that are in the restaurant, hospitality industry an ability to know that they have an advocate.

"It’s a chipping away at what really is a right to privacy, it’s not a right to abortions. It’s a right to privacy there. This constant undermining with additional regulations, with additional laws, is nothing more than anti-woman, and ultimately anti-family." - @hilaryr
Regarding pro-life movement and film @BirthrightFilms: "They have won this argument, because they have been purposeful, because they have not given up, because they’ve gone to the State legislatures, and only recently have they invoked science." - @EleanorNorton
We’re seeing a number of Democratic women reacting to this President, reacting to his Presidency and on the Republican side we’re seeing fewer women, but I think there’s a similar type of movement and interest and reaction to the President. - @Higs118 re: women &amp; Trump
Democrats had a thirteen point advantage when you looked at congressional polls on a generic ballot, but the economy has been doing pretty well.  If you look at those same congressional polls as of a week ago, that advantage has dropped to seven points. - @genevievewood
Now we are seeing from protest to politics, these women talked about not running, not November. Vote, is what they talked about.  That’s why I’m so encouraged that we can not only get Trump, but even, there I think get the House to turn over and even the Senate. - @EleanorNorton
re: Nassar case.  There has been a change in standards, and it’s a good change, and it started really with the media, because the media used to not be willing to print these stories unless they had some witness. @hilaryr
The big question on everyone’s mind is how the heck did this go on @BonnieErbe regarding the Nassar case

Dr. Chanda Macias, owner of a medical marijuana dispensary (@NHolisticDC), talks about some of the challenges she faces, including people telling her children she is a "drug dealer." Listen to her talk on #TTC: https://t.co/5frw2iCu3e
“What’s being done by [women-centered] organizations to get women to run for office [and] get more women of color to run for office?”  @BonnieErbe
“What we should be doing is encouraging more women into leadership positions into all sorts of businesses, including the marijuana industry” @erintothemax
"My older children have disclosed that your mother is a professional in the medical marijuana industry and disperses medicine &amp; they have been very brutal in calling me names like a drug dealer, an unfit parent &amp; what I say is that I love my children."- Chanda Macias @NHolisticDC
“I think the amount of confusion that is out there on state and federal and where we fall as a country really on medicinal marijuana is confusing to many women, so perhaps they’re tepid to enter that space.” @RinainDC
"Keeping such businesses going for capital reasons is really the paramount reason, but I tell you, I'm more worried about what Sessions is doing to drive back the industry and people of every sex and race' @elanorhnorton
How can we get more women in politics? @RinainDC says we have to make women the gatekeepers #womeinpolitics #genderequality https://t.co/ZCiw25O3GS
