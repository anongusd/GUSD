SFFA cannot erase our students from the record and they are not entitled to eliminate race from Harvard‚Äôs application process.
Asian American applicants like Sally has their ethnicity viewed as a positive, not a discriminatory negative. https://t.co/3vnoJMPBUN
3. Socioeconomic status can not serve as a proxy of race. The benefits of racial diversity are distinct.
2. Eliminating the consideration of race would sharply reduce the number of black, Hispanic and other minority students on campus.
But necessity to include race is established by three undisputed facts: 1. Race provides critical texture to many applications, and Harvard must be allowed to appreciate this texture so it can accurately assess these applicants‚Äô strengths and potential contributions in college.
SFFA has a singular goal - a blanket on considering race.
SFFA experts did not consult a single student to form their opinions. Instead SFFA tries to erase countless student stories by placing undue emphasis on its flawed statistical analysis and by ignoring the wealth of evidence in Students‚Äô application files.
Instead of challenging these facts, SFFA has engaged in its own form of active erasure. SFFA did not call a single student to testify at trial.
Sarah was not alone. Eight students and alumni testified at trial. All eight sharing their ethnicity when applying to @Harvard because they felt it was an inextricable aspect of their identity. https://t.co/q7RoDcvvFA
Race-blind admissions is an active erasure. To try to not see my race is to try to not see me‚Äù. This was the testimony of Sarah Cole, Harvard class of 2016.
