@snytv if they blow up the jets management, could Revis be traded as well? multiple needs could be filled in return #snyjets
@ShannonSharpe with Rodgers AP and Peyton fighting for MVP could A. Smith or JJ Watt pull off the upset if either breaks Strahans "record"
@M_Ball28 #jets should draft you bring back #groundandpound
@AdamSchefter No Tannenbaum?

@damienwoody could you see the #jets trading Sanchez and a pick(s) to #chargers for Rivers, headache for headache, Sanchez goes home
@ShannonSharpe would it be possible seeing the jets trade Sanchez and a pick(s) for Rivers, headache for headache, Sanchez going home
@Tempo516 @nyjets I want the @nyjets nyj to trade Sanchez and a pick for Rivers
@damienwoody mo wilk, potentially q coples, greenes serviceable but that's it
