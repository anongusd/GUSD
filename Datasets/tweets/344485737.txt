@gretawire #Greta topic: if Prez is so green energy for autos why not promote other companies. Honda/Toyota/Kia/Hyuandi? They are not Union
@ericbolling If the POTUS is do green driven, why don't we see him promoting Honda and Toyota cars. Answer: they are not Union, GM is!
@DanaPerino I don't see the Prez promoting Honda/Toyota. They are not Union
@DanaPerino Did GM actually lay off workers or are there multiple cars produced on the same production line
@McCainBlogette OUCH!
@LizClaman Can you clarify? GM is halting production of the Volt. Are there any jobs being cut OR are there other cars on the same prod line
