Investing in smart, high tech resources will only improve the long-term oversight of who and what are coming through the border.
We need to provide more technology to be used along the border. We know that most of the drugs streaming into our country are coming through our ports of entry. It's time that we provide those checkpoints with innovative technology to decrease illegal flows of drugs &amp; weapons.
With additional migrant caravans heading our way, we need more boots on the ground actively monitoring all suspicious activity. While at the border, I was taken aback by the professionalism &amp; commitment of those already working to secure the border.
Our goal should be to improve the existing barriers, and implement new physical barriers where they are needed. https://t.co/kKIvVx6s2x

RT @GOPLeader: 226 ‚Äì REPUBLICANS #STANDWITHICE	167 ‚Äì¬†DEMOCRATS DO NOT https://t.co/itljCT8oSP
The recent calls and legislation the Democrats introduced to abolish the agency are asinine and severely undermine ICE's mission. This is only another example of how the D's are willing to risk the safety of Americans by prioritizing criminals above American citizens.
The House Resolution to #StandWithICE has just passed the House. The @ICEgov is made up of hard working men and women who deserve support for the tough jobs they do to enforce our immigration laws. I'm glad to see this legislation pass and I will continue to #StandWithICE
Taking a moment today to wish Jack Colmer, Pascagoula HS graduate, &amp; Charles DeMetz, St. Stanislaus HS graduate, a successful first day of classes at the Merchant Marine Academy. Congratulations and good luck to both in the upcoming school year!

Abortion is WRONG! I am co-sponsoring as much legislation as possible to defend the rights of unborn children.
In 1 week President-elect @realDonaldTrump will take the Oath of Office and become the 45th US President! I'm excited to witness history.
I've become a cosponsor of this Act in hopes of protecting children from parents who think it's okay to end a child's life.
This Act will provide legal protection to the unborn children that cannot speak for themselves. We must stand up for innocent children.
I believe that life begins at conception. I am fighting to protect all of God's children. Starting with the Life at Conception Act.
The House voted in favor of my fellow Marine, General James Mattis. I know he will do a great job as the Secretary of Defense.
The budget resolution has passed the House. This is the 1st step in repealing ObamaCare!
We are working toward improving the health care system, and I believe this is a step in the right direction.
Improve: patient care	Reduce: health care costs	Reduce: government		The Saving Lives, Saving Costs bill does just this.
I've co-sponsored the Tax Free Health Insurance Act which would make every health insurance policy fully tax deductible.
Americans deserve policies that offer healthcare solutions. We don't need band-aids that will only cause more financial discomfort later.
I look forward to serving on the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security in the 115th. Defense is a TOP priority.
It was great to sit down with representatives of the @DesertStormMeml in D.C. this morning! https://t.co/E6YJ5r4GkF

RT @SenThadCochran: ICYMI: Miss. House members gaining committee prominence. Looking forward to more good things from @GreggHarper @CongPal‚Ä¶
I personally believe our nation would be much better off if there were no career politicians.
H.J. Res 17 would limit members of Congress to 12 years of service. 6 terms in the House and 2 terms in the Senate.
I have reintroduced my term limits bill. I have always thought politicians should be forced to go home and follow the laws they created.
The INSPIRE Women Act will encourage women and young girls to study science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).
I have become a co-sponsor of the INSPIRE Women Act. This Act encourages the NASA Admin. to  place women on a course towards STEM careers.
(2/2) and House Agriculture Committee. I have no doubts that he will continue to be a strong and successful leader in the 115th Congress.
(1/2) Congratulations to my friend and colleague @RepTrentKelly for being selected to serve on the House Armed Services Committee
Which is why I am reintroducing my Constitutional Amendment "Right to Refuse." No one should be punished for not purchasing something.
ObamaCare taxes those who refuse to purchase insurance? This should not happen now or ever.
I firmly believed the federal government SHOULD NOT tax you for deciding not to purchase something. You should have the right to refuse.
I've co-sponsored H.R. 41, which would require agencies to respond to congressional committee about proposed rulemaking.
HR 38 will give reciprocity to law-abiding citizens so they can carry their firearms between states that also issue concealed carry permits.
I fully believe in our second amendment right, and will fight to protect and preserve that right. I've become a co-sponsor of H.R. 38.
I am displaying these blue lights in my office window to honor our nation's law enforcement. To all officers, thank you for your sacrifices. https://t.co/4xGdacGanM
Which is why I co-sponsored the Stop Sanctuary Cities Act that denies federal funds to jurisdictions that refuse to share this info.
Why should taxpayer dollars go to cities that don't report criminal aliens to the federal government? It's about time this changes.
Happy Law Enforcement Appreciation Day to all the men and women that protect us every day. Thank you for your dedication &amp; service!
It is time to end this disastrous program that shouldn't have been enacted in the first place. Enough is enough. #RepealObamaCare
Now is the time to REPEAL ObamaCare. That is why I've become a co-sponsor for the ObamaCare Repeal Act.
The REINS Act requires congressional approval rules for economically significant regulations enacted by federal regulatory agencies.
I'm a co-sponsor for the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2017 (REINS Act).
I have signed on to be a co-sponsor of the Alert Act, which is being reintroduced from the 114th Congress.
This bill will require the DHS to respond to law enforcement inquiries about a suspected illegal immigrant in violation of any law.
Today I reintroduced my legislation that would impose term limits on Members of the House and Senate.  https://t.co/wyvXa0Z3lS
