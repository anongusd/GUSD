@SteveKingIA's amendment, based on his H.R. 4879, could upend countless state and local laws across a wide range of concerns including animal protection, food safety, labor, and environmental protection. #2018FarmBill
Despite one bright spot, the #2018FarmBill is fraught with peril for animals. The committee adopted a disastrous proposal that is nothing short of an assault on animal welfare and states’ rights.

TY to @RepPeterDeFazio @rosadelauro @RepRonKind @chelliepingree who issued a joint statement earlier today in opposition to @USDA's egregious decision.
We are appalled by this action, &amp; plan to mount a major effort to reverse a decision that will contribute to hollowing out rural communities &amp; that will allow factory farmers to trick the public &amp; sell their products at a premium under a deficient organic label.
Our exec vp @waynepacelle noted, “Farmers &amp; consumers opt into this program, &amp; @USDA has a simple role: develop fair, science-based standards. Instead, the agency has bowed to Big Ag &amp; scuttled a program that every key stakeholder in the organic space wanted."
This rule, which has been under consideration for more than 10 YEARS, was approved as a final rulemaking action by the executive branch at the beginning of 2017 with overwhelming support from organic livestock producers &amp; consumers alike.
