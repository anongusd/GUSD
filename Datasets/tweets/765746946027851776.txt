@armyscombonoro @mribeiro_17 @vcoelho25 @missnothin_ @brunagarcia_be @Haddad_Fernando Because of Obama’s stimulus policies. Do you think that Trump entered office and waved a magic wand creating jobs? Our economy is starting to tank now after Trump’s tax cuts to the rich. Now he’s using the downturn as an excuse to cut aid to the poor and cut education spending.

@brunagarcia_be @Haddad_Fernando Bolsonaro and Trump = KKK, sexism, racism, hate, violence, intolerance, homophobia, anti-education, anti-democracy. Please open your eyes.
