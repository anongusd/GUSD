@ModerateNation @NYCKNP Again, nobody said there wasn't room in the first place. They'll take the votes of anyone outside of liberals and progressives - so long as we sit at the back of the bus and realize that they have no interest in representing us.
@lowete @horstengela ...unlike the vast majority of people with somewhat of a following, I actually respond to most things - even from disingenuous replies likes yours. On top of your dishonesty here, you didn't even dissent, You merely changed the subject and pretended it was an argument.
@ModerateNation @NYCKNP Nobody said the party has been taken over the left wing - it's split between the left and far left, with moderates a tiny and shrinking minority. The party long ago gave up on us, which is why so many of us have left - Schultz included.
@ModerateNation @NYCKNP It would take an impossible scenario where every major liberal &amp; progressive running had a serious freak accident &amp;/or disqualifying scandal for a moderate like Hickenlooper to have any chance, and from what little Schultz has already said, he's not in the Dem tent anymore.
@lowete @horstengela That doesn't change anything I said.
@ModerateNation @NYCKNP Doesn't make any sense for Schultz to run as a Democrat. He's right that he'd have to lie about what he believes to run as a Dem.		Hickenlooper doesn't have any chance of winning the nomination. I'm just happy he'll be in the mix.

Jeffrey Toobin is right that decades from now, this hearing will be an event that is mentioned when people talk about these scandals.
@TheZachSchultz @RepMarkMeadows @RashidaTlaib It would make the highlights ree, but if all you get is one, it should be how well Cummings handled the hearing. He did a hell of a lot better at keeping his cool while most of the committee members kept being childish. His emotional closing comments were more than warranted.
If there are any winners here, it's Chairman Cummings, and to a lesser extent Cohen, stemming from the ridiculous nature of the vast majority of the questioning. A handful of Dems did a decent job, and Amash wasn't out of line on the GOP side. A pox on just about everyone else.
Republicans calling Cohen's character into question is fair game. The grandstanding they stooped to &amp; the fact that so much of it was a river of red herrings - they barely touched on the substance of the evidence brought - completely overshadowed what ground they had to stand on.
@TheZachSchultz @RepMarkMeadows @RashidaTlaib It's obviously not racist. It's just a dumb red herring, and Tlaib only hurt her own side with that grandstanding.
Perhaps the dumbest single "issue" the Republicans have brought up multiple times is this silly Twitter Women for Cohen Twitter account.		It was just a dumb lark. Trying to make a small Twitter account into something worthy of time in a congressional hearing is beyond ridiculous.
@davidfrum I'll take Obama's side of that bet if he won't. No downside, really.
@willwilkinson Quite the opposite. Her grandstanding only hurts her own side.

Rep @StaceyPlaskett focused on substance here as well. If all the Dems had acted like her and Rep Kelly, they'd both get a lot more out of this politically, and do the job these hearings are supposed to do.

It really is striking how awful these people are at this.		https://t.co/BjrrkzwnGu
@MauriceThoughts @RepMarkMeadows Objectively false.
Also worth noting that testimony IS evidence.
Rep. Steube actually arguing that Cohen was going to pay a six figure hish deal with Stormy Daniels merely because he knew him for a decade... I mean... I have one friend who has known me for over 30 years... since second grade... &amp; I don't think either of us would do that, haha

I missed the early bit, but Rep Kelly seemed to do what all of the Dems should be doing - ask substantive questions in a measured way, focused mostly on questions he can actually ask without engaging in speculation.
@DrJeremyTeuton I understand that you may be fishing to make up a reason to start a fight, but there is nothing to fight about here. You asked a simple question - how we define 'centrist', and I gave a simple answer to it - that that isn't something we do, and that nobody gets to do that.
Now they pass the RED HERRING torch to Rep. Miller...

@ORobHarris So true.
@TarH2O23 Indeed. Schoolyard 'bad winner' BS, talking over Cohen when he starts to actually answer the questions posed, etc etc etc - it's obvious red herring after obvious red herring, among other nonsense.
Whoever is involved with Democrats' decision to continuously ask for speculation from Cohen, rather than hammering away on the mountain chain of actual evidence should be fired. Now this guy is just fishing on weird things like drug use.
@AronDiaz @GMaibohm That's what I was getting at, yes, and most of the Dems are doing a piss poor job of hitting what should be a series of softballs, by continuously asking for speculation, rather than focusing on the plethora of hard evidence available to them.

Close enough. Free speech doesn't extend past your right to say what you think (in most cases). It doesn't entitle you to having anyone listen to you, nor does it entitle you to violate others' rights to force them to do what you want on their platform or property.
@gainesm @ORobHarris @Dividist @Shot_of_Reality @thehill 10s of millions of votes aren't being counted because of all of the people in the 50%+1 states that have zero representation in the electoral college.		With the national popular vote, everyone's vote matters the exact same as every other vote, no matter where you live.
@tjohara2012 As I said in the post, I'll write about policy in future posts.
@gainesm @ORobHarris @Dividist @Shot_of_Reality @thehill ...then you don't understand how NPV works. States no longer have any power. Only individual voters do.
Phasing out nuclear #energy with the goal of mitigating climate change makes about as much sense as smashing your foot with a sledge hammer before climbing Everest. https://t.co/K8WeFsE68O
@gainesm @Dividist @Shot_of_Reality @thehill In the current system, tens of millions of peoples' votes don't count at all, and some voters have more voting power because their state gets more EC votes per voter. NPV makes is so every vote counts the exact same as every other vote, no matter where they are in the country.
@gainesm @Dividist @Shot_of_Reality @thehill Indeed they do. As I've said multiple times already, states have the power to determine how their EC votes are allotted, in the Constitution.
@gainesm @Dividist @Shot_of_Reality @thehill This has already been answered. The goal is every individual vote counting the same as every other.
@gainesm @Dividist @Shot_of_Reality @thehill NPV is about giving every American voter the same vote. Has nothing to do with states. As I said in another thread, this is like criticizing a basketball team for not playing golf.
@cvnerve @TheDeductivist @bernybelvedere I'm more of a fully ripe, cold and crisp granny smith apple, thanks ;)
@gainesm @Dividist @Shot_of_Reality @thehill The law is rather clear that the states get to determine how their EC votes are allotted.		That doesn't mean you have to agree with NPV, but there is nothing wrong with it constitutionally.		NPV is the most equally representative. Every vote counts the same as every other.
@Dividist @gainesm @Shot_of_Reality @thehill I haven't called you any names, but lying about it again illustrates my point wonderfully.
@gainesm @Dividist @Shot_of_Reality @thehill That's an argument for the national popular vote.
@Dividist @gainesm @Shot_of_Reality @thehill Pointing out your lies / your dishonest behavior here isn't the same as name calling, but knock yourself out by trying to play the victim.		Or, rather - cry me a river.
@AidanMcConnell @GalibAlKabir No way to know, same as we can't know the platforms of any of them yet - especially the ones - like him - who haven't even jumped in the race yet. Regardless of party, or lack thereof, I'd just like to see centrists run, which is why I'm also for Hickenlooper and Hogan running.
@gainesm @Dividist @Shot_of_Reality @thehill No such thing as "subjectively true".
@Dividist @gainesm @Shot_of_Reality @thehill Using dishonest rhetoric is one thing, but calling states stupid merely because a supermajority of the American people agree with the national popular vote, and it gets passed in those states... you're theo only stupid thing I'm seeing here.
@Dividist @gainesm @Shot_of_Reality @thehill "NPV would create two classes of State EC voters"		There's another lie. The exact opposite is true.
@Dividist @gainesm @Shot_of_Reality @thehill Moot.
@gainesm @Dividist @Shot_of_Reality @thehill This is at least the third time that you've ignored what I said.		That's MY point. I didn't say anything about it being yours.		People, through their representatives or through referendum, have every right to determine how their state's EC votes are alloted.
@itsBlakeJohnson @billhoagland @PowerLunch @BPC_Bipartisan I'd watch that show.
@rsfury98 delete your account
@Dividist @Shot_of_Reality @gainesm @thehill Indeed it is, because you're judging NPV using the lens that no longer applies. NPV makes all votes count the exact same.		What you're saying makes as little sense as judging basketball games by golf rules.

@gainesm @Dividist @Shot_of_Reality @thehill Did you have a response to what I said? I didn't say anything about what you said, framed or unframed.		Like it or not, the Constitution gives the states the right to determine how they allot their EC votes. Nothing about this is unconstitutional.
@gainesm @Dividist @Shot_of_Reality @thehill If you think some people deserve more voting power than others, that's a position you can take, but I think all of our votes should count the same.
@gainesm @Dividist @Shot_of_Reality @thehill Incorrect. Your state says that whoever wins the national popular vote wins the whole election. With the NPV, it's no longer about states. What it is about is literally the name - National Popular Vote.
@gainesm @Dividist @Shot_of_Reality @thehill It works the same as any other election - whoever wins the popular vote wins the election. It doesn't matter what state you're in. Everyone's vote counts the same.
@GalibAlKabir He's not in the race yet, but unless every other candidate drops out first, there is no reason to.
@AdventureTN (just looked it up)		The maximum an individual can donate to a national political party committee is $35,500, and $10,000 to state/local parties:		https://t.co/U4As6VHv7P
@gainesm @Dividist @Shot_of_Reality @thehill States aren't beings. They don't want things, and as someone who has lived my entire life in states with disproportionate EC power, I can say I support it because it's wrong that voters in some states have more voting power than anywhere else. NPV makes every vote count the same.
@AdventureTN The way the Reform Party formed after Perot was that the network of supporters that were left after his campaign stuck around and formed a party. That could happen again, and I think it would, but it would require a great many people donating.
@AdventureTN That's not legal with current funding laws. He could fund an organization of some kind, like a Super PAC, 527 or dark money group (hopefully not the latter), but donation limits are such that it's not possible for one person to do that.
This applies to everything - not just journalism, though journalists should certainly hold themselves to a higher standard than day to day interactions. This is one facet of the wider degradation of discourse in our culture... so so many people ignore what people actually say. https://t.co/AS5a1rmNCb
@Dividist @Shot_of_Reality @gainesm @thehill That's indeed one of the lies people have been repeating about the NPV. It's objectively false.
@Dividist @Shot_of_Reality @gainesm @thehill Incorrect: "Some states will give up the right of their citizens to control their state votes."		That is not the case, no matter how you try to spin it.		Nor is the way you're spinning it here - they are exercising their right to determine how their votes are allotted.
@SeanHeymann @norwegian76 YOU brought up causation, and it's obviously relevant.		Now you're just stooping to childish lies.
@Dividist @Shot_of_Reality @gainesm @thehill @Shot_of_Reality  is right. This isn't complicated, and it's how virtually every other election works.		And what you say here is objectively false. States choose how they allocate votes. Nothing about that conflicts with the NPV.
@SeanHeymann @norwegian76 Causation is what I've been saying - the cause isn't more candidates running. The cause is a candidate failing to earn enough votes to win. That's their fault, not the fault of people running to represent voters none of the other parties represent anymore.
@norwegian76 Now you're stooping to lying. That's not how voting works.
@norwegian76 @SeanHeymann Even more of a willfully ignorant response. I already do.
@Etree87 Non-issue at this point. He hasn't done this any more than anyone else publicly considering a run, and I have seen him articulate some, but he'll obviously need to start rolling out a platform if he launches an actual campaign.
@Shot_of_Reality He definitely does.
@norwegian76 Your willfully ignorant response was indeed comical.
@SeanHeymann @norwegian76 That outcome is up to voters, not candidates. If a candidate fails to earn enough votes to win, that's their fault, and nobody else's.
@norwegian76 Blame other people for your side's failures, then. Gotcha.
@ret_cw3 That's already been checked off, heh
@norwegian76 Centrists aren't welcome in the Dem tent anymore, and have no chance of winning, and if Dems can't win with competition, then that's their fault for not earning enough support to win, and driving centrists out.

@graham_strouse @CathyYoung63 @Halalcoholism @CHSommers @Ayaan Speaking as someone who works in online marketing, I can tell you that that is largely a myth. Social media (and online promotion in general) can be a multiplier of anything, used the right way.
@odetteroulette @elechner1 @jkempcpa @sahilkapur If a candidate or party doesn't earn the votes of someone, because someone who represents them better comes along, that's nobody's fault but the candidate who failed to earn those votes. An array of candidates competing to earn votes is what democracy is supposed to look like.
@sahilkapur The most recent poll with a specific candidate mentioned showed him earning more Republican votes.		Also - candidates can't siphon votes. Votes aren't owned by a candidate until the moment they're cast for them, so - barring things like fraud - they can't be siphoned away. https://t.co/Ng8rjQMn2F

@RockefellerRep1 To make just the same amount of money - much less raising more, you have to significantly raise middle class income tax rates to make the flat tax high enough to lower the upper income brackets to the same level.
@RockefellerRep1 Can't do a flat rate. That would require a huge increase on the middle class, to offset lowering taxes on those that need it the least. Make it even more progressive than it is now. Add a higher bracket and tax it at 50%. Make 2nd 40%.

@thsteele Again, you're not arguing honestly - nobody is arguing for taxing patients or fining companies. You've been watching too much cable news.
@BrigetteToole If I lived in an open primary state, I might vote for her in a primary if Hickenlooper or Delaney weren't on the ballot.
@thsteele "These medications have a role."		It's obvious that nobody is saying otherwise, but you've said it twice now anyway. This isn't cable news - throwing out obvious red herrings like that doesn't add anything of value here.
@thsteele https://t.co/e1MbKjngOV
@jmaxmann There are no remotely easy solutions, and taxing capital gains the same as earned income is both fair and fiscally sensible.
@jmaxmann Nonsense question. Few want to raise taxes, or cut spending. This is reality, not a fairy tale where tax cuts, spending and debt magically will be paid for by ignoring them or with dishonest rhetoric.
@thsteele Nothing about that conflicts with what I said.
PS - I tweeted a bit less than I did during the Schultz town hall... I was testing out the live chat functionality on a hidden page on our site, and mostly have it working, so next time we do this, I'll still tweet some, but we'll also chat live on our website as well.
Before tonight, I didn't see anyone winning over the liberal rank and file over Biden... now I can see it. Klobuchar seems to sit squarely with the average liberal Dem rank and file - split the progressive left btwn multiple candidates and she has a path.	#KlobucharTownHall
If Clinton had been half as good at this as @amyklobuchar was tonight, she'd have easily done a good 5% better in the 2016 election I bet.		I look forward to seeing how well she does in a debate. If she can take &amp; give proverbial punches... she's a contender.		#KlobucharTownHall
Good point - I noticed this as well. Not quite Jed Bartlet telling that guy in NH that he got hosed (West Wing reference), but she's differentiating herself from the progressive left:	https://t.co/18QPjbWCMH
Guns: devil is in the details on assault weapons ban (but most agree in principle), and great delivery in hammering away on universal background checks, and general "common sense gun control".	#KlobucharTownHall
Deficit question (excellent)... will she dodge on deficit reduction and spending... dodged on entitlement spending (AKA - she's a Democrat)... bumping up the Social Security tax is good &amp; happy to hear she wants to tax capital gains the same as earned income.	#KlobucharTownHall
I'm not very good at predicting what Democrats will do in their partisan primaries, but Klobuchar is better at this than any of the other candidates I've seen so far. Others are as good at speeches, but she's the best as this back &amp; forth stuff I've seen yet.	#KlobucharTownHall
Question about cynicism (not just kids see politics that way) - was a softball, but something just about all of us can identify with it. She answered well.		Is it just me, or are there a lot more commercials than the last CNN town hall?		#KlobucharTownHall
@TeriPoulton So true.
Good use of story to answer the immigration question, and appeal to higher patriotism.	#KlobucharTownHall
Bit of a rambling answer on college costs, but the substance is good, and she's right that free "college for all" is a fairy tale, while there are an array of reforms that can - and should - happen.	#KlobucharTownHall
I haven't read enough about policy around opiods to comment widely, but the idea of taxing the companies profiting off of the opiod crisis to help pay for social costs makes common sense.	#KlobucharTownHall
Crazy how many people there have been affected by opioides. The scale of it is insane.	#KlobucharTownHall
Good pivot to policy and resume from the personal question, and something I agree with and have some work experience in, having worked in restorative justice. A path to redemption for people with addiction is solid policy and smart politics.	#KlobucharTownHall
I'll leave substance of the question about women to the women, but she's very good at this town hall format. Definitely comfortable, quick on her feet and very good at this. This quality is very beneficial to a campaign (much better than Schultz).	#KlobucharTownHall
Wandering answer to question about negative reports on her mngmnt style... is she going to actually answer the question.. mostly red herrings. I don't so much mind that she gets angry sometimes, but some of the vindictiveness against staff who left is no bueno.	#KlobucharTownHall
She's punting on the Green New Deal - it's not just aspirational, but there are some genuinely bad ideas in there that conflict with what she said about green policy not conflicting with the economy.	#KlobucharTownHall
Answer on the Green New Deal - good answer on getting us back into the Paris agreement, and general verbiage on gas milage rules and the like, and that green policy isn't inherently anti-economy, but she didn't give a clear answer on the Green New Deal itself. #KlobucharTownHall
Klobuchar's first question was an obvious super softball - easy hit. #KlobucharTownHall
I got the live chat software working, but the social login functionality of our site isn't working fully yet, which would hinder the ability of people to comment - so we're going to just be on Twitter tonight.

@footster13 @jo_p71 @JaredWalczak @taxfoundation You just argued my case for me, then pretended you're arguing against it.
@footster13 @jo_p71 @JaredWalczak @taxfoundation Yes - fair.		Because we want to encourage people to start building equity.		So what? If you can afford a half million dollar home, then you don't need government help.
@jo_p71 @footster13 @JaredWalczak @taxfoundation You can ignore reality, but doing so doesn't magically make it go away.
@footster13 @jo_p71 @JaredWalczak @taxfoundation Has been. It's worse than the income tax.
@jo_p71 @footster13 @JaredWalczak @taxfoundation Not at all. If you have enough money to buy a half million dollar home, then you sure as hell aren't anywhere near a place where you need help from the government.
@jo_p71 @footster13 @JaredWalczak @taxfoundation Incorrect - it's regressive, because people who make more spend less of their income.		Replacing the income tax a consumption tax is nothing more than a pipe dream.
@footster13 @jo_p71 @JaredWalczak @taxfoundation They benefit everyone the same, who use them. They don't magically give more or less benefit to you based on the state you move to.
@footster13 @jo_p71 @JaredWalczak @taxfoundation Partially disagree. I think we should means test them, and - for instance - only allow the mortgage deduction to be used for primary residences under maybe ~$500,000, but some of those taxes (like the child tax Jo Co mentions below) are worthwhile.

@footster13 @JaredWalczak @jo_p71 @taxfoundation Anyone dumb enough to believe what they said about their tax cuts deserves the dissonance they're experiencing if they find out what it really did.		Where you choose to live is up to you. You should be taxed the same as everyone else in the country making the same amount.
@jo_p71 @footster13 @JaredWalczak @taxfoundation aint that the truth
@footster13 @jo_p71 @JaredWalczak @taxfoundation We're one nation, and if that's what you want from your representatives, then boy do I think that's wrongheaded, but it's your right to vote for people who want to create even more division than we already have if that's what you want.
@footster13 @JaredWalczak @jo_p71 @taxfoundation If you're talking about a tax loophole that should never have been there to begin with, then yes - and in general. I think someone making that money should pay more in federal taxes no matter where they choose to live.
@footster13 @jo_p71 @JaredWalczak @taxfoundation It's always been unfair. Never should have happened in the first place, and the GOP wasted that money. It should have gone to deficit reduction, not softening the blow of their insane tax cuts.
@jo_p71 @JaredWalczak @footster13 @taxfoundation That's your state's decision.
@theLazyAphorist Same. I watch his show from time to time, to basically check in on where libertarians are on things, but that cult of personality him and other IDW people have built around themselves is insipid.
@jackcurran49 What about if you only count those born on February 29th?
@jo_p71 @JaredWalczak @footster13 @taxfoundation Tossing the SALT tax isn't screwing anyone - it's just taking away an unfair tax break. If a state decides to tax its residents more than other states, those people shouldn't get special treatment in federal taxes vs residents of other states.
@theLazyAphorist In most cases, it's every segment vs every other segment - you're right that we're not any more with the libertarians or conservatives than we are with the progressive left. This sort of spin is standard fare from Rubin.
Unsurprisingly, #Trump's speech (dishonestly grasping at straws) trying to justify declaring a national emergency (to grab Congress' constitutional power of the purse) is riddled with inaccuracies:	https://t.co/sA2g5aPaR3
@bstewart1776 What does this tweet say? I can't see it.
McMullin is right. This is no emergency under any reasonable definition - it is a longstanding problem that is in decline, and the president is obviously using this to violate Congress' power of the purse. It's a blatant abuse of power. https://t.co/9tGPgEChC3
@10thParty @samforus Median income doesn't sense when you include a bunch of part-time workers. They pay much higher than the industry.
It's impossible to communicate if people aren't using the same medium of exchange - namely words as defined in dictionaries.		If you don't, then you're to blame for miscommunication, and it's your fault when people don't understand what you meant.
In short - many mistakenly believe that haphazardly using language to express feelings at people, or twisting language to fit stilted agendas, amounts to communicating.

@DutchWordsworth @elchefe @joshscampbell Looks like someone uploaded that clip to Twitter. They banned him, but people are still free to upload clips fair use, to comment on them, I'd imagine.
@IMAbusymom04 @StateSideSix @Motoconomist @gelliottmorris Yes, that's what I was alluding to - the ol' nuclear family.
@IMAbusymom04 @StateSideSix @Motoconomist @gelliottmorris Two glaring grammatical errors in the span of about an hour... I'm slipping, heh
@IMAbusymom04 @StateSideSix @Motoconomist @gelliottmorris There is something perfect about that comment coming from someone who's user name is 'Average Citizen'.
@geneticmaize Feel free to hit me up if you need any WP, or online marketing, advice. I generally give advice away for free to friendlies.
@geneticmaize There is another service called ScribbleLive that does the same thing. I'm sure there are more - didn't look too terribly hard yet. Between now and bumping up against this one's freemium limits, I'll do a thorough review of all the options.
@geneticmaize I bet we follow some of the same Facebook pages... I'm a big fan of the Credible Hulk. I used to be in this hilarious group that would find wingnut groups and share outlandishly stupid memes there, just to see how many people would like and share them.
@geneticmaize I've got it... right here:		https://t.co/LfyGPKekf7
@elchefe @DutchWordsworth @joshscampbell I saw that... and before I wasted part of my life on researching it further, I realized that I only have one life to live and delving into the personal lives of anyone - much less wingnuts - is not a very fruitful use of the limited time I have :)
@geneticmaize Oh man... I'm really not sure which is worse, hahaha		Overall, there are more wingnuts involved in politics, but the GMO conspiracy theory nuts are a really aggressive bunch.
It is genuinely insane that the Trump administration refuses to even produce intelligence reports to Congress on the Khashoggi murder.
@geneticmaize My way to lessen that is to only allow people to create accounts with Facebook Connect, or by asking me to create an account for them. That should cut most bots and trolls out.
@geneticmaize I found a great live blogging plugin that allows people to submit comments into the main stream (comments would be at the bottom, as usual with regular content), and I can add Tweets to the stream as well.
@geneticmaize When we do live stuff I'll do both on-site &amp; Twitter. If we can set up a watch party on Facebook (only is possible if said thing is being streamed live on Facebook), then we may do that as well. Annoyingly hard to stay on top of all three, but I aim to be where the people are.
@geneticmaize A fellow WP nerd! :)		Have had all of those experiences, both on my old blog, and on client sites (I build WP sites for part of my living).		Only way I'll do native WP comments is if it's logged in users only. I just don't hv the bandwidth to deal with that lvl of spam &amp; trolls.
@_grammar_ got me! :)
Downsides include that it does slow page load speeds a bit, it's easier for people to anonymously troll (but also allows people uncomfortable with commenting with their real name to do so), and some technical glitches that have come as Disqus has grown and gotten a bit bloated.
Using Disqus would connect the site with a huge network of active website commenters, many of us already have accounts, it blocks spam well enough, and a lot of evidence (on online marketing blogs I follow bc of work) suggests it's good for ginning up engagement.
Downsides include a bit less virility, since the comments won't get some free promo on Facebook or Disqus, and in general there will likely be somewhat fewer people in the comments, since some wont jump through the hoops to create an account.
If we only allow those who create accounts to comment, this gives us the most flexibility, functionality wise (TONS of neat comment plugins out there), and should nudge more people to create accounts, and thus more people - in time - would be connected to the @centristforum.
Downside is some people don't have a Facebook account, don't want to comment with it publicly and the other options have some functionality that Facebook comments don't have.
Facebook comments are the easiest to manage, as almost everyone has a Facebook account, its easy to block people, tedious for trolls to create new accounts just to troll and it helps content go a bit more viral on Facebook to use them.
Each has it's own upsides and downsides... leave thoughts below, but I'll speak to some of the top-line strengths and weaknesses (as well as why others aren't being considered) in the next few tweets.		Feedback very much welcome, as always.
What commenting system should we use for our community blog?		I'm going to try and get the community blog's skeleton up and running by Monday, so we can do a live blog / chat on there during the Klobuchar Town Hall on CNN - what system would you all prefer we use?

@nichole_elohcin Whether or not that's true, organizing an opposition continues to be the best way forward.		Whether it results in a centrist party eventually becoming one of the two major parties, or some other scenario - we only control what we do. What the left &amp; right do is up to them.
Amen. That's what supporting democracy looks like.

@ScottWRasmussen Odd question - perhaps you might ask that question of someone who is arguing that these things are necessary? I can't imagine too many people take that position, nor why you'd be asking it of me...

@ScottWRasmussen Nobody here is saying that isn't important, and it's also important to point out when people are saying something incorrect, as you do regularly.
@ScottWRasmussen The meaning of words change, but they haven't here. Just because some people say something, that doesn't make it true, any more than the people who dismiss your polls because they think you're the same as the other Rasmussen are right just for saying it over and over and over.
@ScottWRasmussen Still means the same thing. It's more that there are a lot more people who have bought into dishonest messaging about it, and are using the term incorrectly.

@PKHarrington @VidaEterna_16 @USCentrist @realDonaldTrump Your own statements prove otherwise. An election can't be spoiled just by someone giving voters another option to choose from, because candidates don't own votes until they're cast for them - voters do.		That's democracy, and that's what people like you are against.

@PKHarrington @VidaEterna_16 @USCentrist @realDonaldTrump I didn't tell you what you're for - I pointed out that you've made it clear that you're not for democracy.		You're the one arguing that someone shouldn't run because it might lead to a result you don't like. He's running to represent people who both parties are ignoring.

@Fechtmeyer @jaketapper Pointing out that the president said one thing, and has done another, is what journalists should do.
@PKHarrington @VidaEterna_16 @USCentrist @realDonaldTrump It's quite literally true.

@PKHarrington @VidaEterna_16 @USCentrist @realDonaldTrump That's the point with EVERY election. People decide to run for office, an people get to decide who they vote for. If you disagree with that, then you disagree with representative democracy.

@gainesm Mohammad bin Commodus
@midclassmoderat *would (ha)
@willfleet "But you must know that a vote for Schultz or anyone like him is a vote for Trump."		What I know is that anyone who thinks this is willfully ignorant.		Only a vote for Trump is a vote for Trump.		Nobody owns any voters vote except the voters themselves.
@midclassmoderat They're unreasonably high. I don't see how bringing them down to levels closer to the norm wouldn't dissuade anyone in the middle class or lower.
@LoftyPlanet Never been a big fan of their coffee. The breakfast sandwiches, and those old fashioned donuts, are pretty good though.
@willfleet Then you're not looking. Not sure why you'd want to do that, but it's your vote, to use how you wish.
@gainesm He mentioned a blind trust, which is the norm, though I'd prefer that he sells them too.
@midclassmoderat I'd definitely vote to make them less generous, but not get rid of them, yeah.
@tobyjrussell Watch for yourself, and again - what he's laid out so far is more than the norm of what someone who hasn't even launched a campaign has released at this point.
@willfleet The policy he's laid out so far is - by far - the most centrist of any candidates with a whiff of a chance of winning the Dem or GOP nominations. Everyone is obviously free to have their own standards, but that's primarily where mine are.
@tobyjrussell He laid out several - and has given more than some of the candidates who have already launched their campaigns.
@will_buckskin Yeah - if he leaves a toe out... that'll make it harder to trust him.
PS - If Steve Schmidt - one of Schultz' advisers - doesn't launch a dark money group (blatant corruption), then I'll almost certainly personally be on board with the Schultz campaign.		Regular disclaimer - Uniters(.)org doesn't endorse.
@will_buckskin I think he said he'd make the decision in the spring / early summer, or some such. I'm for him jumping in as soon as he gets better in interviews, public speaking and irons out more policy. Good not to rush in, but waiting too long would hurt too.
@will_buckskin Difficult, but it's there.
@xWing_Dan Speakin' muh language. He's brought up Washington in interviews, but it'd be great to include something from that in his stump. Lincoln's better angels too. Some Theodore Roosevelt wouldn't hurt 🤓
@willfleet I have no use for the corrupt, out of touch major parties, and - like everyone else - I'd like to have someone on the ballot that actually represents most of what I'd like to see in government.
Let's put a bow on this w/ the fact that the latest poll showed Schultz already at 20% - already where Perot ended + he's a stronger candidate, against weaker candidates than Bush41 &amp; Bill Clinton, and a landscape with a much larger chasm between the parties - that's a path.
...I think he needs to do better at being more specific about things he agrees with from voters in the Dem &amp; GOP tents, and not generalize as much about the far left and far right, or he'll drive away too many center-left &amp; center-right moderates.
Not that it'll help with trolls, but this proved that he was indeed a center-left independent. Outside of just wanting more (I always want more) on policy ideas, which is fine this far out...
CNN replaying the point where he pointed out that you can't spoil a broken system just by running. I'd just like to hear from him not only that he's not going to run unless he thinks he'll win/not help Trump, but once he's in - he's in, and will stay in to the end.
He did good. I mentioned this earlier, but you really can see the improvement in just the last couple weeks.		Lack of specifics this so far out is annoying to wonks like me, but there is no fair expectation of a full platform this far out, even if he launched his campaign.
Good answer on Trump's irresponsible Syria decision... and (boom) he said we were abandoning the Kurds, and ended by nailing it with Trump's lack of restraint.	#SchultzTownHall
I think he could get a lot of mileage out of the opportunity idea, the American dream... seems like they may be hinting at that with their #ReimagineUS hashtag that they've been using.	#SchultzTownHall
He really could get a lot of mileage out of corporate responsibility to our culture.	#SchultzTownHall
Good point on getting people graduated - subtle dig on Trump University?	#Schultz2020
Gun question... starts good... staying mostly vague. Good on what he said, but didn't mention many specifics. Fine this early.	#Schultz2020
@IamTJH I found an interview from years ago where he hinted at support for it, but haven't seen him take a clear stance on it recently.
Didn't bite on the public option. It's a HUGE mistake if he doesn't run with that.
Yet again, Poppy is right to push him for a fuller answer. Just improving the ACA is good, but isn't enough.
Say the public option... say the public option...
Another softball, since he's answered the question so many times, but his response to the Philadelphia scandal was great.		Restoring the humanity of the country, and pointing out that the president has a role in the morality of the country - just great.
@jbcrane69 She just asked for a ballpark. It's fine that he didn't give one, though I want more (always more - gimme the details, in a 50-page white paper, haha). There really isn't a short way to say that, but he will need a ~30 second summary answer to that question in time.
I like that Poppy is asking for specifics. Schultz' emotional delivery on the VA was good - his specifics were just okay.		Politically, it's smart to be so vehement on that as well, and most importantly - it's just the right thing to do.
Good question on potential conflicts of interest with his ownership of Starbucks stock.. his answer... seems to be implying that he'd put his investments in a blind trust, which is the norm, but wasn't clear.
Shouldn't be a surprise, given his background, but his answer on trade is the strongest mix of delivery and substance so far.
Saying China is a competitor, and neither an enemy or ally, is exactly how I say it, and is miles better than Trump.
Finally... he points out that you can't spoil a broken system. I think that can be said better, but the idea of a spoiler is just fundamentally flawed.
Good answer, but it was an easy one. Basically just the whole logic of being an independent centrist.
Let's see how Schultz answers that softball...
First commercial break - doing great so far. Significant improvement in a short period of time, perhaps in part because he may be more comfortable in a town hall format?
@buddynewman Which is totally fine this far out, and before he's decided to run. There are several candidates who have already jumped in the race that haven't said much more.
"President Trump has a habit of not being truthful." - Howard Schultz	- several dozen headlines, right there
Good for Poppy to try and get him to say a number on how high he thinks income taxes should be on wealthy people. It's fine that he doesn't have a specific answer the better part of two years out, and the rest of his answer - critisizing Trump's tax cuts - were good.
He's so right about pointing out how the green new deal is a fairy tale. You can tell he's working on messaging on the subject - felt like he hopped around a bit. Solid on the substantive criticism of it.
His substance on immigration is great, and his pivot to saying it's about our humanity is a great framing. He's weak on oversimplifying the position of Dems &amp; GOP - an issue he has with the way he presents a number of issues. He needs Dem &amp; GOP votes - needs do that better.
Being a wonk, I really just try to ignore the personal stories of politicians, but I can't ignore that a lot of people are the opposite, or at least are impacted by it substantially. He's got a great backstory, and it's been one of the things he's delivered well from the start.
His answer on how he differs from Trump on business experience is definitely the best answer along those lines I've seen from him. He's come a long way in the last couple weeks - clearly is getting needed coaching.
I didn't get a screenshot of it, but the overall support for Schultz was already at 20% - meaning he's already around where Ross Perot ended his campaign in 1992, &amp; that's at a point when only about half polled even knew who he was, and most who did had no opinion of him.
@TulliusCicero43 Johnson didn't do that, and if you think that candidates are to blame, then Hillary Clinton is the most to blame, by far. Her mistakes and decisions had more of an impact than the whole Johnson campaign, several times over.
Relatively the same can be gleaned from these results - favorability ratings vs outright support. More Republicans than even independents so far. https://t.co/UwlgRFxZth
The latest polling on his candidacy show that Democrats' worries about him are - so far - just not based in reality. As I predicted, after seeing how different people across the spectrum were reacting to what he's said so far, he'll earning more support from the GOP. https://t.co/G368rrNMK2

@bruins4thecup @SteveSchmidtSES We're not talking a map of ideology, and that map is missing a lot if we were.		Political spectrums are based on the population of the nation in question, and I didn't say Dems are left wing. There are some left wing Dems, but most are just on the left.
@shewz @SteveSchmidtSES You have no clue what you're talking about. Support for anti-corruption efforts is stronger in the center than anywhere else on the spectrum, unlike the left and right that - even when they care at all, they usually make exceptions for their party.

@ivn @SenWarren She's objectively a deeply partisan Democrat, so calling her independent is obviously ridiculous, and being an independent doesn't mean you couldn't be divisive, so it doesn't make sense to frame the question that way to begin with.
@Randy_Shackles It doesn't mean that you have the right to the use of anyone's private property, any more than during the era when pamphlets were the way most political messaging was done, were people entitled to use of someone's printing press.
@Randy_Shackles You don't understand what freedom of speech means.		It means nobody can stop you from speaking your mind.		Websites don't have the magic powers to stop anyone from doing that.
@Randy_Shackles It's not censorship. These people chose to use these services, and agreed to user agreements when they joined. They broke them, and were banned. Playing victim like entitled children doesn't change any of that.
@Randy_Shackles That's definitely the dumbest thing I've read this week, so far. You are genuinely pitiable if you think that the ability to break rules on a website without being banned magically makes someone a nonperson, hahaha - that's just sad.
@Randy_Shackles People get banned for breaking the rules all the time. I've had a client that did even. 		There is no right to be able to publish on a website, nor should there be.
@Randy_Shackles It's their platform, and their rules. If you don't like it, then nobody is forcing anyone to use it, on either the publishing or watching side.
@Randy_Shackles You brought it up, &amp; you're objectively wrong. Now you're pretending that the subject you brought up is inconsequential, which is just ridiculous.

@CricketGirlMN @SteveSchmidtSES Your attempt to change the subject with a Russian red herring just illustrates your lack of an argument on the electoral front. Fraud is a different issue. Candidates don't decide elections.		We definitely agree, as do the vast majority of Americans, that dark money is wrong.
@CricketGirlMN @SteveSchmidtSES Dark money is rampant on the left and right, and is just starting to get out of bed in the center - I'm doing my part to slow it down.		Also, voters decide who wins elections. If a candidate can't win unless the competition is limited, then they don't deserve to win.
@yinzer58 I studied political science, and very much feel the same way.
@yinzer58 Not how people usually do that - typically if you put a quote before a link, that just means it's from the article. Can't help if people are too lazy to click through, though.
@CricketGirlMN @SteveSchmidtSES That's not how it works, but dark money is wrong, no matter the excuses people make.
@midclassmoderat Absolutely. I had a lot of fun, but also saw how unfair it was. Very few parents could do it. We were there for hours. Not fair at all.
@midclassmoderat Then, as they wound down, I got a bunch of the people I knew to get our side all riled up, and got them to start stomping and repeat some campaign chant... the ground literally shook. It was great fun.
@midclassmoderat ...some of the people on our side started trying to shout them down, so I got in front of everyone and quieted them down, to be sporting and all.
@midclassmoderat One of my favorite moments in all of the political activism I've ever done was that day... the Clinton people started doing a chant, and they didn't even fill bleachers on their side of the bleachers, while we filled up more than half of the gym... so when they started chanting..
Too much I wanted to pack into that tweet... the main thrust is that it just makes no sense for people to pretend like FDR supported socialism, or DSA folks of today, and it makes it even less sense if you stop cherry picking and look at the breadth of policy issues.
@midclassmoderat I was the lead for the Obama campaign in my district in Omaha's first Dem caucus in '08... we were much better organized than the Clinton people, and crushed them far more than we would have in a primary. Wasn't really fair. Was fun, though, haha
“Roosevelt’s own goal was to save capitalism, not to overthrow it. ...created Social Security, fought to protect interests of the working poor... But FDR was firmly committed to private property &amp; free markets. ...never embraced socialist-style planning.”	https://t.co/JFTY04oaXb
@midclassmoderat Caucuses made Sanders seem like he had a lot more support than he really does. If all Dem states had primaries, the gap between them would have been much larger.
@midclassmoderat Yeah, the problems already inherent in small portions of the population that vote in primaries - very partisan and not remotely representative of the general population - are magnified greatly with caucuses. Few can spend hours in a room to vote.
@midclassmoderat Not sure there is a way to fix that one. If they aren't taking public funds, then the state can't tell then how to select their candidate. The main legal argument for open primaries is if they're taxpayer funded, then all taxpayers should be able to vote in them.
@Brant_Roun @midclassmoderat If last election is any indicator, open primaries may well help progressives more. That'll be another interesting thing to see.
@midclassmoderat More like more people should leave the Democratic party, because they don't deserve our support. It's their fault for not pushing for open primaries, while pushing moderates out.
One thing she has going for her, besides electability in comparison to candidates farther left, is that are less people in her zone of the Dem tent that are running for president, so even though the base is farther left, &amp; especially if Biden doesn't run, she might have a path.

@FJBoccadoro @MayaMacGuineas @BudgetHawks Unfortunately, saying we shouldn't doesn't make it so. None of this would be a problem if we had reasonable people in Washington.
It's wrong when Republicans do it, it's wrong when Democrats do it, and it's wrong when independent and third party people do it.		If Schmidt wants to do some good, the bare minimum is to do it with a transparently funded organization, like @samforus
Forming a dark money group means you have chosen corruption and anti-transparency over the right of the American people to know who funds efforts influencing our politics.
I'm all for organizations starting to push for building a third party in the center, but you're part of the problem that makes the current two party system so terrible if the organization you form is a dark money group - as @SteveSchmidtSES reportedly said he would be doing.
@John_Hudson @Cambria4DD The way the question was worded was purposefully obtuse, but Schmidt overreacted, and the bigger problem here is Schmidt just said that he was going to launch a dark money group - I hope they nail him for that.
@JonVespasian Interesting because I'm the mirror opposite. She's not on my list of people I'd consider voting for (may change - haven't delved yet), but I think this is overblown and understandable. I don't think I could work in DC w/o venting regularly, nor do I think any decent person could.

@JonHutson @OpenSecretsDC @amyklobuchar I've had to quit political activism three times, in large part for that reason.

@JonHutson @OpenSecretsDC @amyklobuchar I agree. This stuff just seems like evidence of the opposite. I don't see how anyone with semi-normal wiring, or any sort of moral foundation, could do that job and interact with the horrible people in politics without needing to vent regularly.
@JonHutson @OpenSecretsDC @amyklobuchar This sort of stuff strikes me as the polar opposite of psychopathy, which generally results in people who are able to hide emotions far better the rest of us, while normal people would have to vent regularly from wading through the insane cesspool of Washington.

@GOBLUE37 Note that I said it "seemed like it was", not that I was assuming it was, but, you know, don't let that stop you from acting like some cartoonish fool on Fox News and saying that that amounts to idiocy like "we should assume we know him personally?"
@GOBLUE37 Did you have a question for me, or another dumb red herring to try and change the subject?		I'm not suggesting anyone assume anything. I'm pointing that this matches his track record of public behavior, in his career, in public, on Twitter, where I've followed him for ages, etc.

@TeriPoulton Next time you get to ask a presidential candidate a question, ask them if they'd be open to letting that Queer Eye show do a makeover of the Oval Office.

@Texan_21C @matthewmuses @jbenton @caro I doubt I made that up. Sounds like something I read on an SMM industry blog, or some such (what I do in my day job).

The difference between us is I want a genuinely centrist party, that is not just a centrist version of what we see on the left and right now.

It's not a problem that can be fixed. The organization is the problem. You'd have to start over entirely and get rid of all but a few of the current leaders, to make it salvageable.

@sharethefact That doesn't even make sense inside of it's own internal "logic", haha - if they're illegal immigrants, they can't be stripped of citizenship they don't have.
@davidhawkings That's just stupid. Bravo to them if they want to be frugal.
@davidhawkings Interesting! I really like this citizen cabinet idea.		I have been using something like this with ad hoc Twitter DM focus groups, polling followers, and plan on using a similar idea for our version of a board.
@CommonCause @IndieNj Howard Schultz has been saying the same thing.
@TeriPoulton @bernybelvedere ...has to be said.		Micro-fruit micro-aggressions cannot stand. These offensive little commie berries need to be banned from campuses. We must boycott them until they disappear into the dustbin of sugar history.		#FullSizedFruitMatters #BoycottCommieConfectionaries
@GOBLUE37 ...a stern Twitter ratio-ing.
@TeriPoulton @bernybelvedere I generally sit when I slander micro-fruit. To each their own, I suppose. I wont judge.		Nasty little things... slowly rotting in artificially colored chemical sugar mush for gawd knows how long before placed on top of perfectly good confections.		They must be stopped.
@_Centerleft1999 And sorry to break your - yet again - willfully ignorant bubble, but Germany, The Netherlands and Switzerland (among other nations not on that list) each use their own version of a PUBLIC OPTION system.
@_Centerleft1999 What's not okay is you thinking you should have the right to take healthcare decisions away from others.
@kaylive Unless they did something bizarre, the options would have the same rules as now on coverage.
@bernybelvedere Cherries are gross,	Legacy parties are too.	Schultz' messaging is shakey yet,	but they're improving the brew.	#ReimagineUS
@OpenSecretsDC @CoryBooker The article is wrong in saying that Super PACs are becoming increasingly unpopular on the left. In reality, they're raising and spending more money than ever.
@debjanise A stranglehold would be stripping away options and forcing everyone onto one insurance service - AKA single payer.
@tobyjrussell That was the biggest blunder of his presidency - by far.
@kaylive @_Centerleft1999 Exactly. Polling proves that the perception of what 'Medicare for All' means is vastly different from reality. Most of the people who say they support M4A believe it means choosing a medicare-based healthcare plan would be an option, along with private options.
@bernybelvedere Alex Jones Jr. is a chip off the old block.
@jbenton @caro Not surprising. Twitter is actually quite bad at driving traffic.
@debjanise That makes even less sense than the BS the right wing say about these things. You can't maintain a stranglehold by giving people the option to choose a Medicare-based insurance plan instead of private insurance - that's the polar opposite of a stranglehold.
@kaylive That's not a loophole. That's just how it works in some countries, like how Medicare works now. The point is, it's wrong, as well as stupid fiscally, to not allow people to go with private insurance if they choose.
@DrEricJenkins "Yes it doesnt." - perfectly sums up your position, haha
@m_nwwn1 No shot in the primary, but in the general I'm positive he'd do great - too early to get a good read now, though, since he's not well known nationally yet.
@_Centerleft1999 What you just said is the lie. What this, and a number of other polls, prove is that when people say they support medicare for all, most of them mean they want it to be an OPTION, which means they don't support single payer or Medicare for All - they support the PUBLIC OPTION.

@LDenoncourt @HowardSchultz That's not something a candidate has the power to do. Only voters can do that.
@ORobHarris @HowardSchultz If anyone else is seriously interested, they're certainly taking their good ol' time saying something about it.
@LDenoncourt @HowardSchultz I've watched over a dozen interviews and read several dozen articles - seems good to me, and most of the nonsense being lobbed at him isn't even true. He's just not used to politics, and is talking off the cuff on a book tour. That'll change if he decides to run.
@LDenoncourt @HowardSchultz Unless someone else runs as an independent too, then if he runs, he'll be the only one in the centrist/moderate range on the ballot. No moderate will make it out of either major party nomination process, and certainly not with the fringe parties.
AMEN: "The truth is, our representative democracy doesn't represent us anymore. 	 	Voters should choose their leaders. Today, it's our elected officials who are choosing their voters, and that is all at the center  of this intractable problem in Washington. " - @HowardSchultz https://t.co/1dQyIgAQ5P
@midclassmoderat If I don't see anyone else who could realistically be on the ballot and is better than a lesser evil by the time I'm done launching the org (after podcast and community blog), then I'll personally probably hop on the Schultz train.		Uniters the org doesn't do endorsements.

@bernybelvedere @thomasmetcalf @ArcDigi "What would a multiverse be like..."		Like THIS.
@midclassmoderat No such correct messenger, with right timing, is on the menu. He's just the only option currently motioning toward running that has a realistic chance of being on the ballot across the country that is better than a great or lesser evil.
@willfleet Definitely are some substantive parallels there.
@trap1305 @HowardSchultz That's not something anyone has the power to do, and that's not what he's talking about. He's just saying that neither represents us, so we need to work outside of it.		As Theodore Roosevelt so aptly put it, all we can do is "Do what we can, with what we have, where we are."
@Kira_Gallo @secupp I already pointed out how.
@trap1305 @HowardSchultz Which, I would hope, is avoidable this time. We're still a long way from there.
@trap1305 @HowardSchultz ...and moderates are a small and shrinking minority in both parties (worse on the right), so even the moderates left don't have the power to determine what happens I  those tents.
@trap1305 @HowardSchultz You misunderstand - I'm saying that's not something we can do because what happens inside the major parties is their business. We wouldn't vote for any of them regardless, but we don't have any control over what the left or right do...
@trap1305 @HowardSchultz That's not something we have the power to do. We can only organize ourselves. How the legacy parties respond is up to them.
@trap1305 @HowardSchultz That's when the Whig party died and a third party took it's place... which is very much in line with Schultz running.
Elizabeth Warren is playing up a promise not to take Super PAC money... but there's a little problem with that - Super PACs aren't allowed to donate to candidate campaigns in the first place, so it's a completely empty and misleading talking point. https://t.co/p3bqgW0ibE
@Kira_Gallo @secupp Objectively false, given your own statements here. Trump doesn't get to play both sides of an issue, and neither do you.
@Kira_Gallo @secupp Nobody is being naive here. You're just dishonestly trying to weasel away from what you said earlier, and - like Trump - trying to play both sides.
@Kira_Gallo @secupp They didn't know that, and this shows that you were either being dishonest earlier, since you admit the obvious - that Syria is indeed an enemy, or you're being dishonest now. They can't both be an enemy, and not an enemy at the same time.
@IndyByChoice @secupp @parlezallday Ordering attacks on US troops in Iraq, and on top of that - military actions aren't the only way a foreign despot can be an enemy.
@Kira_Gallo @secupp Except he has. He ordered attacks on American troops in Iraq, and that is far from the only way a foreign despot can be - and in his case, is - an enemy.
@bridgetteevab A large part of what I've started putting together so far has been more of a direct response, but also I'd like to go over the top of it and not be limited too much by what has already been said / make our own points.

@Ironyisfunny8 @OpenSecretsDC @realDonaldTrump @ewarren "...I won't be taking donations from any Super PACs."		Those are her words, not mine.		Super PACs cannot donate to candidates. That's a fact.		See Open Secrets' page on the subject: https://t.co/kItqjIAlzN https://t.co/5SK44exICO
@Ironyisfunny8 @OpenSecretsDC @realDonaldTrump @ewarren Sanders did go back to taking PAC money.		He also started a dark money group.		And it's true that Super PACs can't donate to political campaigns.
@Ironyisfunny8 @OpenSecretsDC @realDonaldTrump @ewarren ...then he went right back to taking PAC money, and even started a dark money group, after he dropped out of the 2016 presidential race.		Warren is also touting a completely empty talking point. Super PACs aren't even allowed to donate to campaigns. Only regular PACs can do that.

@tdpubs @CoachLap @HowardSchultz He still is, based on what he's said so far. He's just not for single payer or the 70% marginal tax, but he is for expanding and improving the ACA, repealing the Trump taxes, raising taxes on corporations and wealthy people.
@Jonatha10167449 @ReginaRed4 @JonVespasian ...who are you responding to?
@Jonatha10167449 @ReginaRed4 @JonVespasian Most of our debt is owned by us as well.
@tdpubs @CoachLap @HowardSchultz That's just plain not at all true. He's very clearly on the center-left - the GOP is much farther from him than the Dem tent is.
@Droizism @jerry_jtaylor @NiskanenCenter Related question... why doesn't the address to your home do my laundry. Until it does, we should quit using addresses &amp; just hope mail gets to us by describing the shop on the corner you turn at, that there is a left somewhere in there, and the Christmas lights you still have up.
@Droizism @jerry_jtaylor @NiskanenCenter That's generally what happens when you repeatedly critisize a label for not being something it never was designed to be in the first place.
@Droizism @jerry_jtaylor @NiskanenCenter Thanks for sharing? What does that have to do with anyone else?
@ReginaRed4 @Jonatha10167449 @JonVespasian I've actually watched a number of his interviews, and spoken with someone who works for him. Everything I said is something I've seen him say in an article, or in an interview. You're just regurgitating dishonest talking points that don't even reflect what he believes.
@ReginaRed4 @JonVespasian Schultz is center-left, and you just admitted that you were wrong about what you said above, and if that's accurate - as you just said it is - then it's not possible for the center to be where it would be if Democrats - who are objectively already on the left - moved "Hard Left".
@ReginaRed4 @Jonatha10167449 @JonVespasian Except he's for raising taxes on the wealthy, on corporations and hasn't said anything about cutting SS or Medicare for regular people, so the only thing you're illustrating here is your ignorance on the subject.
@ReginaRed4 @JonVespasian That's not accurate.
@Droizism @jerry_jtaylor @NiskanenCenter The only thing you clarified here is that you haven't been listening, because I did not say anything about people in the center-right being the same... so I'm not sure what your point even is in bringing up this strange question.
@Droizism @jerry_jtaylor @NiskanenCenter Nothing about those things are in any way mutually exclusive or conflicting.
@Droizism @jerry_jtaylor @NiskanenCenter Indeed you have - again in your last tweet, where you said it "does not further Niskanen's central cause". It's not a selling point in the first place, so that's not a criticism, any more than pointing out that a hammer doesn't help geese fly.
@JonVespasian @BridgetPhetasy She's calling you phat.
@Droizism @jerry_jtaylor @NiskanenCenter Everything you've said here amounts to you making things up to say it's failing for not doing something it's not even trying to do in the first place.
@TiffanyBond ...because she often has voted against the GOP. Still does some, though less of late on major votes.
@Droizism @jerry_jtaylor @NiskanenCenter That doesn't make any sense - especially about your feelings, which don't have anything to do with it. It's just an accurate description of where they are on the political spectrum today.
@JonVespasian @Jonatha10167449 @ReginaRed4 The political spectrum isn't based on any of that, but is based on where the population - the whole span of it - stands on the issues. The GOP tent has picked up and moved (as have the Dems, to a lesser degree), but the whole spectrum doesn't move with them.
@JonVespasian @Jonatha10167449 @ReginaRed4 How conservative is perceived is a moving target, but that doesn't change the political spectrum - it just means that people calling themselves that cover a different part of that spectrum.
@FJBoccadoro @MarkWarner He did, and has continued to since.
@Droizism @jerry_jtaylor @NiskanenCenter Accuracy is *a* problem, but not the way you're making it out to be.		The terms aren't designed to be not empty. They're merely neighborhoods on the political spectrum. Full / empty don't even apply, and pretending they do is one great example of people using them inaccurately.
@Jonatha10167449 @ReginaRed4 @JonVespasian A "huge unhappy" is most likely the rock bottom we're going to have to hit eventually.
@JonVespasian Even if they didn't win, they would likely spark a lasting organizational network that would spawn a party, along with an array of other things we need.
@Droizism @jerry_jtaylor @NiskanenCenter A position is defined by the substance of the position itself.		Every word is a label. The left/center/right labels are no less useful than any others, so long as they're used accurately.
@Droizism @jerry_jtaylor @NiskanenCenter They certainly should do better with all the hype and - for example - thinking that just pretending words mean different things that makes it so, but so long as the substance is good (and, again - it is), they're on the right track I think.
@Jonatha10167449 @ReginaRed4 @JonVespasian I wish that were true. That paradigm is dug in, and aided by a massive army of partisan and ideological zealots, along with an army of political mercenaries from outside groups that support them.
@Droizism @jerry_jtaylor @NiskanenCenter Socialism is left wing here. In other nations its even farther left, and in some it's close to centrist.
@Droizism @jerry_jtaylor @NiskanenCenter Two very different terms.		One is a full blown ideology.		The other is merely a location on a map, with the map being the political spectrum in the United States. They're center-right here in the US, but wouldn't be in other nations, because each nation's spectrum is different.
@Droizism @jerry_jtaylor @NiskanenCenter They are ideological - they just like pretending they aren't. What they are is anti-zealotry / anti-extremism, which is great. If you look past the hyperbole that they often use, even if you disagree with them, it's usually good content. Certainly much better than the norm.
@ReginaRed4 @JonVespasian "First of all, most of the country is significantly to the LEFT of where the ideological center is"		That's literally impossible, and centrists are less far from Democrats than Republicans. Republican light is not where the center is.
@Droizism @jerry_jtaylor @NiskanenCenter It's an accurate label for where they happen to stand on the American politics spectrum. Why wouldn't they use it, and what equally or  more accurate, and better, alternatives are there for them?
@RuleandRuin Except... he's objectively wrong.
@RuleandRuin @denminn @DamonLinker @NiskanenCenter That's not remotely close to what Schultz believes.
@timrhughes @RuleandRuin @NiskanenCenter Splitting isn't what centrist means to begin with. It's just a neighborhood on a map. How you arrive there is entirely up to you.
@RuleandRuin @NiskanenCenter Moderation never left political discourse. If you actually think you're bringing it back, you haven't been paying attention.
@jerry_jtaylor @NiskanenCenter Moderation never left political discourse. If he actually thinks you're bringing it back, he hasn't been paying attention.

@Photogkris That was a public statement by Trump that you're calling fake news, but if ignorant trolling is what your sad life needs to get its warm fuzzies, then you be you.

@adamckolasinski @xan_desanctis @SykesCharlie @TheAtlantic Nobody said consciousness is life - that's a weak red herring and you know it.		Unconscious just means they're sleeping, knocked out, etc. That's not at all the same as not having the ability for consciousness. Until that manifests, it's a human body, not a human being.
@adamckolasinski @xan_desanctis @SykesCharlie @TheAtlantic The moment they gain consciousness, I agree. Before that, I don't. That happens around the start of the 3rd trimester.
@bernybelvedere I'd like to add that Bob is definitely not my uncle. #JoinorDie
@jamz227 @nsewanswers @GOBLUE37 @BretStephensNYT That actually agrees with what I said. Sexism most likely played a much larger marginal role than Jill Stein did, though it's hard to say because she got more Republican women voting for her than a man would have.

@_bobgillingham That's theology, not science.
@Todays_Pretty @BoxxOfMeng @HowardSchultz @GOP I already gave you an answer. You're just trolling, and too lazy to do the work it takes to understand other people - or I'm being too kind and you don't want to, which is seeming more likely the longer we talk.
@Todays_Pretty @BoxxOfMeng @HowardSchultz @NicolleDWallace Bad messaging and policy are different things, and it's certainly un-American to pressure someone not to run to artificially alter the options people have on the ballot to fit one's agenda.
@Reimagine2020 @Gammy901 @copernoll @NatlPopularVote Exactly.
@Todays_Pretty @BoxxOfMeng @HowardSchultz You just illustrated my point yet again.		He's on a BOOK TOUR right now, not a campaign. You're openly treating him with more scrutiny than people who have fully launched their campaigns - NONE of which have rolled out a platform yet either.
@Todays_Pretty @BoxxOfMeng @HowardSchultz I spend the time learning what liberals, progressives, conservatives and libertarians think. You can too, and if you don't, that's on you, and it certainly isn't going to happen on such a social media platform - much less such a limited one like Twitter.
@Todays_Pretty @BoxxOfMeng @HowardSchultz Now you're stooping to lying.		As I already said, if you want to know what he thinks, go find it out for yourself. I'm not your research assistant, just because you're too lazy to learn what other people think.
"Super PACs &amp; independent expenditure hybrid PACs gave out a combined $552 million to the top 10 highest-paid political consultants during the 2018 election... meaning only a handful of groups produce a majority of political ads that fill the airwaves..." // over half a BILLION https://t.co/lHyGZ5canf
@xan_desanctis @SykesCharlie @TheAtlantic Some are, but this doesn't reveal any such thing - nobody reasonable is arguing that a fetus isn't a human body. The question is at what stage of development does it grow into more than just a body, and become a human *being*.
That's the start of a short thread on the subject. It's an important issue, highlighting how even the vast majority of those in Congress who are trying to make themselves out to be anti-corruption - left, right or center - take actions that indicate otherwise.
@sodappop_ Well... I wont judge you for having multiple personalities. I just hope I get to engage with the stable genius one(s).
@sodappop_ You monster.
Issue One (Beckel works there) has been doing a great job of highlighting the corrupt nature of leadership PACs. Here's just one example: https://t.co/wpgrdVSCVV

Looks like we broke 23k followers last night/this morning.		Welcome newbies - hope to see you in the comments, and retweeting news about centrist and moderate campaigns and ideals, anti-corruption, political reform and current events.
@TarH2O23 @BoxxOfMeng That's not legal.
@OpenSecretsDC Problem is it's just a smokescreen for pretending they aren't taking special interest money, while they still are for special interest PACs they agree with. If they actually were anti-corruption, they wouldn't take any PAC money at all.
@TarH2O23 @BoxxOfMeng That can't be done legislatively, and we already talked about incentive - permanently lost pay.
@TarH2O23 @BoxxOfMeng Not similar, but stooping to that low of a level because other are doing so just adds to how many people are in the pig sty.
@TarH2O23 @BoxxOfMeng Moot. Using their lives, and the turmoil it would throw the country into if they were assassinated, as bargaining chips is reckless and irresponsible, to be kind.
@Todays_Pretty @BoxxOfMeng @HowardSchultz Then you haven't been paying attention.
@Todays_Pretty @BoxxOfMeng @HowardSchultz Excellent illustration of my point, about how you're expecting more from him than candidates who have already launched their campaigns.
@TarH2O23 @BoxxOfMeng Goes way too far. Not just a bit, and it's not "additional".
@Gammy901 @Reimagine2020 @copernoll @NatlPopularVote Incorrect. The Constitution says the states decide for themselves, and nothing in there says they can't come together and do this.
@Todays_Pretty @BoxxOfMeng @HowardSchultz I've found a couple dozen stances so far, and he isn't even running yet.		People are acting as if his non-candidacy needs to have a more rolled out platform than the campaigns who have already launched - none of which have fleshed out platforms either. It makes no sense.
@Todays_Pretty @BoxxOfMeng @HowardSchultz Then you haven't been paying attention, and if you want to know what Schultz thinks, then go find out, and wait until he actually runs or not and starts to roll out a platform.
@yes2cyborgs @F_Maschine @naval (awesome Twitter name)
@Gammy901 @Reimagine2020 @copernoll @NatlPopularVote Then you disagree with the national popular vote, and this is moot.
@TarH2O23 @BoxxOfMeng Because Secret Service does that to protect the country from turmoil and assassination brings. It's not about the person. It's about the office, and the country.

@Gammy901 @copernoll @NatlPopularVote Yes, and what you're saying doesn't make what I said any less true.		Every INDIVIDUAL'S vote is the same. The national popular vote is about everyone's votes counting the same, not segmenting people by state, giving some more voting power than others.
@Gammy901 @copernoll @NatlPopularVote Not possible with the national popular vote.
@copernoll @NatlPopularVote ...you responded to a post about replacing the electoral college with the national popular vote.
@Gammy901 @copernoll @NatlPopularVote That doesn't conflict with anything I said. Whoever wins the national popular vote wins the election.
@copernoll @NatlPopularVote With the national popular vote, every single vote counts the exact same as every other.

@DemFromCT @ron_fournier Except for the fact that he's got higher taxes. He's just not for the 70% tax.
@TesseractUnfold @CBSAllAccess Worth paying for along with Elementary, Madam Secretary and the occasional other show, for a few months a year.

@NatWorden @alansmurray And yet I've seen him do so myself, and this is but one issue, he hasn't even launched and he's already made several distinctions between himself and Democrats.

@taylorgrayson @EPoe187 More importantly - there are far from only two, given the vast spectrum of ideas.
@EPoe187 It really doesn't, though. One group if ideas not making sense doesn't have anything to do with whether another makes sense.
Very much agree, though I find reviewing honest arguments from people I disagree with, or - most especially - people who have come to the same ultimate conclusion by a different path, to be stimulating. It's the dishonest argumentation I despise / find burdensome. https://t.co/d3AKG9g5oQ
@_Centerleft1999 @mikeallen No way to know. That's not a graph of the American political spectrum.
@_Centerleft1999 @mikeallen If you include the fringe, then they are too. So are progressives.
@_Centerleft1999 @mikeallen I don't know about you, but both of them are far left.
@_Centerleft1999 @mikeallen He's a strange outlier, who has moved a lot in a short period of time (AKA - he's an opportunist and can't be trusted) and he's not a Blue Dog - he's in the Senate. Blue Dogs are a House caucus.
@_Centerleft1999 @mikeallen None of the Blue Dogs have conservative voting records.
@_Centerleft1999 @mikeallen That's not talking about American politics.
Things like this pass virtually every time they make it into the ballot. The reason it's relegated mostly to ballot initiatives is because the people who could pass it nationally are the same people who don't want it to pass in states where their party is dominant. https://t.co/VMyKDgw1Uj
@_Centerleft1999 @mikeallen You don't understand what conservative means if you think Blue Dogs are conservatives, and yes - progressives are far left.
@_Centerleft1999 @mikeallen Also false. Liberalism is just on the left, and there are moderate (Blue Dogs), liberal (New Dems) and far left (Progressive) caucuses.
@nsewanswers @amyklobuchar Did you have a response to what I said, or did you just not read it at all?
@_Centerleft1999 @mikeallen And? They're on the left, not left wing. Most on the left are liberals, not left wing.
@nsewanswers @amyklobuchar Not meaningless, but not the most important metric.		Among a great many other things, yes - Clinton's loss is primarily on her, her campaign and party.
@nsewanswers @amyklobuchar You just gave an example of what I just said.		"Not possible 4k will overcome 1 billion in ad expenditures"		Obviously. And?
@_Centerleft1999 @mikeallen Objectively false.
“Iowa polling by a prominent 2020 hopeful found that the Democratic electorate has moved sharply left. ...the polling found that "socialism" had a net positive rating” - @mikeallen // note that it's poll by a Democratic campaign, not right wing rag	https://t.co/eG8ra5eMlr
@nsewanswers @amyklobuchar Helping Trump is only one of their aims.
@nsewanswers @amyklobuchar Ah - *interaction* are a different thing. Still, that's $4 per interaction... that's not good at all.
@nsewanswers @amyklobuchar Even a poorly targeted ad campaign will be seen by far more than 1000 x 50 if you spend $4,000. I've never spent even a thousand on the old blog or my current social accounts in all the time I've been on social media, and I've racked up hundreds of thousands of impressions.

@NatWorden @alansmurray ...suggesting that you not take my word for it and go listen to what he has to say for himself is, in no way, anything remotely close to an insult.		You are right in your sarcastic comment about Twitter, though in the mirror opposite way you meant.
@jaketapper Madison was a wealthy plantation owner, and that isn't an argument - it's an observation. Your "argument" here is yet another red herring.
@Marknovakusa @thehill @realDonaldTrump @Boeing Repealing the Trump taxes and increasing capital gains taxes would make his taxes go up, not down, and that's what he's said he is for doing.

@Polit_eurOpines @HowardSchultz That's what I just said.
@Polit_eurOpines @HowardSchultz That's the second time you've said something that is different than you said in the tweet I responded to, as if that's an argument against what I said in response to a different point.
@NatWorden @alansmurray Go look for yourself. Go watch some of his longer interviews where they ask him about stances, instead of just responding to nonsense in the media.
@Champthinks2 Yeah, most of what people are saying about Schultz in the media right now isn't even accurate, and he's not actively campaigning in any meaningful way, or rolling out a platform. I like most of the substance of what I've seen so far, though.
@Dave_is_Central There's that density again.		I literally said what just a few words before that.		You're not this dense. You're just an empty shirt troll.
@Dave_is_Central Nothing wrong with disagreement. The problem is your dishonesty.		Like so many people in American politics, you believe it's acceptable to use dishonest argumentation to make your points. 		You're wrong.
@Dave_is_Central You can dishonestly try to spin it however you want, but polls don't tell people to do anything - they give you a snapshot of current public opinion, and none of this justifies the behavior of anti-democracy hacks who want to limit peoples' options to fit their agenda.
@Dave_is_Central And you just illustrated my point.
@Dave_is_Central Cry me a river. You came here and blatantly lied about what I said, you used dishonest argumentation in a previous thread and now you're playing the victim.		You act dishonestly, you deserve to be called out on it. I called you that because that's how you behave.
@Dave_is_Central It's obvious I haven't said anything at all like that.		Are you really this dense, or as you just lying on purpose, for lack of any actual argument to make?
@Polit_eurOpines @HowardSchultz And? That's not what you said, and what you said here isn't even true either.		This scenario is cherry picked, and only applies to certain swing states. In states that lean one way or the other, one party already doesn't have a chance to win, but a centrist could.
@Dave_is_Central Probably because "telling him later with polls or primaries" isn't a thing that exists, and telling people they shouldn't run because it doesn't fit your agenda is anti-democracy and patently unethical.
@NatWorden @alansmurray Only the first Clinton on that list was in the centrist to moderate range.
@alansmurray I like Hickenlooper - the only centrist/moderate Democrat who looks like he's probably decided to run, but you're right - he's got no chance of winning.		The question is whether the Dems will nominate a liberal or a progressive.
@TedNordhaus It's amazing that not paying people at least minimum wage is even legal.
@jerry_jtaylor Nuclear, solar and wind together is rather obviously the best path forward.
@mileskimball Solar will skyrocket the moment cheap, grid-scale battery technology is developed. It's hamstrung until then, even if it keeps getting cheaper - which it will, and regardless, expanding nuclear to provide the reliable base load is the best option available.
Accurate - I noted the same thing yesterday. That faction of the "Democratic" party is anti-democracy, as is anyone who wants to limit options available to voters to artificially give their candidate an electoral edge. https://t.co/XslJc3zmlr
@m_nwwn1 @HowardSchultz Same here. I don't know how anyone could have made a firm conclusion with such limited information.
@Polit_eurOpines @HowardSchultz So could anyone. That's politics.
@ThePlumLineGS @paulkrugman This is a dumb, and obviously false myth.
@pizzaw0lf https://t.co/G0oVL5kT8Y
@m_nwwn1 @HowardSchultz That's right, so it should be taken with a grain of salt. I'd be curious to see the side tabs and verbiage.

Evidence that my point about the landscape providing a much larger opening for Schultz now than it did for Perot in '92 - just 2 points behind where Perot ended the campaign, after a week where &gt;90% of the media about @HowardSchultz was negative. Bodes well to start here. https://t.co/NaxNdbzIGq

@dperryw76 Happy you asked.		Haven't launched yet, but as a 527, all of our donor information will be on:	1. Open Secrets	2. the IRS public database of political organization donor filings	3. Our website will update much more often		And we'll reveal ALL donors. Even if they donate just $1.
@dperryw76 Keep defending corruption if you want, but all you're doing is defending the spread of corruption among centrists.
@dperryw76 There is no way to verify any of that - because they're a dark money group. No Labels doesn't pretend they aren't, at least. Unite America lies about it, and attacks people for pointing it out.
@dperryw76 This isn't fighting fire with fire. This is starting more fires.		Dark money is one of the root causes of what is wrong with our politics today.		Change your mind. Be part of the solution, instead of making excuses for corruption.
@dperryw76 There is no try here. It's a choice to be a dark money group, and it's flatly stupid to pretend like meeting that ridiculously low standard of ethical behavior somehow amounts to tying your hand behind your back.
@dperryw76 I commend the good work they do, and condemn their corruption because I think centrists should be better than the corrupt political status quo.		Transparency in funding is an absurdly low standard, and not only does Unite America not meet it, but they lie about it.
@dperryw76 You have that backward.		You're doing the centrist cause a disservice by defending corruption, merely because it's corruption from an organization you agree with.
@dperryw76 If centrists want to be better than the left and right, we need to actually *BE better*, not just be a centrist version of the corrupt norm on the left and right.
@dperryw76 ...and every time dark money groups are brought up in podcasts blog posts, or other content on a Uniters channel, their corrupt status will be highlighted.
@dperryw76 More importantly, all projects Uniters(.)org takes part in will bar participation by anyone with a position in a dark money group, or who has taken money from an active dark money group in recent years.
@dperryw76 Not at all.		Most of the money spent in politics is transparent. Super PACs, campaigns, regular PACs, 527s and parties all have to reveal their donors.		You may be okay with political corruption, but I'm not.
@RYANBOSSXX @HowardSchultz I tend to avoid conversations that mostly fall in the realm of speculation/conjecture. We can say that humanity is much better off now than it was generations ago, and most things are trending in a positive direction. Some aren't.
@RYANBOSSXX @HowardSchultz It's been significantly worse than it is now multiple times in our nation's past, as well as countless times in other nations and across the span of history. Usually, societies hit rock bottom at some point and turn back. Occasionally they fall apart, or a civil war happens.

@nsewanswers @GOBLUE37 @BretStephensNYT While true, that's not what I'm referring to.		Inside those swing states, the number of votes Jill Stein earned from voters - for instance - was dwarfed by the decisions the Clinton campaign made that shed voters by at least several times over.
@gooneygooner @MsMelChen Aint no thang. I thought that mimicking her format would be just a playful bit of fun.		I don't even really think football is boring. I watched the AFC championship, and it was interesting enough to keep more than half of my attention. First game I've watched in several years.
@gooneygooner @MsMelChen You seem to be under the impression that what I said was serious...		Someone's choice of free time activities is among the dumbest thing one could judge someone for.
@mcjorracing @alansmurray @HowardSchultz Same general reason the GOP leadership is trying to put up hurdles to make it harder for someone like Larry Hogan to run against Trump in the GOP primary - they think they're entitled to the presidency, and only agree with democracy when it produces the results they want.
@J4Justice45 @alansmurray @HowardSchultz Your vote, your decision, same as mine is to never vote for a lesser evil ever again.
@J4Justice45 @alansmurray @HowardSchultz If the more left leaning voters are divided, then that's the fault of the party on the left for not earning their support, and again - voters decide elections, not candidates.

@MauriceThoughts @BretStephensNYT @HowardSchultz Amen. If he runs, he should go on every major medium, save the worst zealot outlets.
@nsewanswers @GOBLUE37 @BretStephensNYT Exactly, and I'd say that decisions that effect millions being overlooked, while most of the attention zeroes in on things that amount to a fraction of a percent of that is part and parcel of the mentality behind said counting of chickens.
We Should be Making Voting Easier, not Harder // @JohnAvlon with a #RealityCheck on McConnell's comments about the #HR1 reform bill: https://t.co/WPogGVon2s https://t.co/pH18LW7MKY
@nsewanswers @GOBLUE37 @BretStephensNYT If that hadn't happened, then a few dozen thousand votes in swing states that decide the winner in the electoral college wouldn't have been a problem.
@nsewanswers @GOBLUE37 @BretStephensNYT People are myopically focused on a few marginal factors, and ignoring much larger ones. The marginal ones are only relevant because the big ones happened - Clinton made a long list of big mistakes that allowed the race to be so close, for instance.

@Abes_chin @women_4_schultz @HowardSchultz Another lie. Trolls are old hat.
@TeriPoulton @kab_fair @CNN @smerconish Exactly. He has been against Trump's tax cuts since back when they happened, and he said he's for raising capital gains taxes, which is where the richest people make most of their money.
@Abes_chin @women_4_schultz @HowardSchultz Now you're stooping to lying.		I said nothing about everyone else being wrong, and I'm obviously not always right. You're just being a petty troll.

@nyckatyc @BretStephensNYT So long as tens of millions of people click on headlines about her, it wont change. It takes two for this tango - the media isn't doing it to the country, it's one half of the equation, with the other half being people who clamor, click, like, share, comment, troll, etc.
@GOBLUE37 @BretStephensNYT Millions of votes did, mixed with a quirk of the electoral college.
@Abes_chin @women_4_schultz @HowardSchultz You've got it backward. Voters decide elections. Having options on the ballot can't be spoilers - they're just options for voters to choose between.

@Katie12583304 No single person could, but if he makes election reform a core part of his campaign he could sure make a big dent. He could throw in with the @NatlPopularVote organization, who found what essentially amounts to a loophole that could eliminate the electoral college, in effect.

@TheAnti_Critic @Brant_Roun @samforus That's supposed to say '527 group', not '52y'.
@jerry_jtaylor You poke above your weight.
@politvidchannel I don't.
@TheRickWilson Who am I to judge what they do in the comfort of their own...
@TheAnti_Critic @Brant_Roun I very much do.		Being a dark money group doesn't make good work they do go away. It just makes them suspect, and means they chose a legal structure that is inherently corrupt.		Both things are true, and in no way cancel each other out.
@TheAnti_Critic @Brant_Roun @samforus is a 52y (like we're forming as), which requires donor transparency. Lots of organizations I trust are charities, like think tanks, which don't have to reveal donors but/because they aren't allowed to engage in campaigning.
@FritzHayek @IonaItalia @HPluckrose @pjsempe @Friedmanzone I have a picture of me burning Marmite in my yearbook. Probably disqualifies me from future office, but I stand by my actions.
@sodappop_ @HowardSchultz If I end up supporting Schultz, this would be the biggest reason why, because we could - like like Dens &amp; GOP do with their presidential campaigns, piggyback party building.
@_Centerleft1999 @HowardSchultz Depends on if it's an open primary state or not.
@sodappop_ @HowardSchultz Certainly more and more. My 'side' hasn't won much at all in the last decade, but I'd never stoop to this garbage. Its on us to organize and represent ourselves.

@Brant_Roun Dark money group means they aren't legally required to reveal their donors. If you can't find an organization on a government website, Open Secrets, etc - they're a dark money group. Incomplete &amp; unverifiable donor lists don't change that, no matter how much they lie about it.
A dark money group retweeting a post decrying dark money... another reminder that we are definitely living in the Twilight Zone. https://t.co/RwuQQNmxTy
@TeriPoulton @HowardSchultz Religious devotion and entitlement is right.
@PiccolaDonnina @HowardSchultz For the Nth time...		"...which might make some sense if I was arguing anything contrary. You're just talking past."
@PiccolaDonnina @HowardSchultz ...which might make some sense if I was arguing anything contrary. You're just talking past.
@PiccolaDonnina @HowardSchultz You're arguing against a straw man. I haven't said anything against people who don't support Schultz. As I made abundantly clear, my problem is with those who think others shouldn't run to "to maximize the outcome they want."
@PiccolaDonnina @HowardSchultz Nothing you're saying is an argument against anything I'm saying.		If people don't want to vote for him, then don't vote for him, same as I won't be voting for any of the Dems, or Trump, certainly not a libertarian or Green - but we all deserve people on the ballot.
@PiccolaDonnina @HowardSchultz Apparently I stuttered:		"And? I wouldn't give him a favorable rating yet either, because I haven't seen enough of what he believes to come to a conclusion yet."		He hasn't even launched his campaign yet. At earliest, it'll be months before we see half of his platform. So?
@PiccolaDonnina @HowardSchultz Unlike those who don't believe in Democracy, I'd never stoop to saying that any of them shouldn't run, just because they won't be getting my vote.
@PiccolaDonnina @HowardSchultz And? I wouldn't give him a favorable rating yet either, because I haven't seen enough of what he believes to come to a conclusion yet.		I have come to a conclusion on Trump, and every Dem that has a chance of winning their nomination, and none come even close to earning my vote.
@Kid_Adventure_ @HowardSchultz Illustrating my point excellently.
@bearheg Do you have an actual question, or just more purposefully obtuse trolling?
The cure is more democracy, more people being represented in government and an array of candidates spanning the spectrum, EARNING VOTES.		If your candidate can't win unless voters' options are limited, then your candidate doesn't deserve to win.
...and calling for them to leave because they don't cater to your agenda - you are part of the disease infecting our democracy.
...and if your reaction to someone from that unrepresented half of the population deciding to run, so those people might actually have someone on the ballot that represents them, is to attack them for doing the exact same thing that people you support are doing for you...
An election where the potentially viable candidates represent MAYBE half of the population can only be the byproduct of a "democracy" that is deathly ill...
Fortune EIC @alansmurray thinks @HowardSchultz running is "a good idea because someone needs to challenge the two-party stranglehold on American politics... the two parties act like a classic duopoly, serving their own needs but not those of the country.” https://t.co/f2Wmv8X2gh
@JHarryPainter @JohnLeFevre They do have valuable skills, which is a big reason why so many leave to take higher paying jobs in other fields.		Journalists produce the product. They aren't salespeople, and they shouldn't be. It's the job of others in news organizations to take care of the business side.
@ContrarianGal @HowardSchultz Just about every time I've seen a decent anti-corruption or election reform ballot initiative make it on the ballot in recent years, it's passed. We can't trust Washington to pull us out - we'll have to do it state by state, through direct democracy.
@ContrarianGal @HowardSchultz If Schultz is smart, he'll make that a core element of his campaign.		To the bigger question - it'll most likely take at least a decade or two for ballot initiatives to lessen the influence of outside dark money, Super PACs, PACs across the country.
@vitalcenter1 @HowardSchultz The situation they're in is of their own making - abandoning centrists, then complaining when those independents run to represent those of us that neither party represents.
If the reaction by the political class to @HowardSchultz's possible candidacy has illustrated anything, it's how many of them don't actually believe in Democracy, and instead think the options available voters should be chosen by them to maximize the outcome they want.

@ECrustius @KimStrassel One of many reasons to consider supporting him.
@JHarryPainter @JohnLeFevre I do online marketing for a living (this account is my side-project). What he's talking about is a fairy tale. A truly minuscule fraction of a fraction of a percent of people who make money from affiliate marketing do even close to that well.
@JHarryPainter @JohnLeFevre No, they couldn't. Very few people make anything remotely close to that much from fifty articles, much less just a few. He's an extreme outlier.
Bloomberg builds an all-star political team that may be used for a campaign, or “Koch Brothers-type group for Democrats” // that last bit is a quote from a "top aide"... that would not be a good thing. More of those sorts of orgs is definitely a bad thing.	https://t.co/McDtt2b0mp
@cowabungatime @DLeonhardt @jbarro Also, there are millions of millionaires in the United States, and that skews heavily toward the older end of the spectrum - not paying benefits to people who don't need it will save billions. If that counts as 'barely save any money' to you, that explains a lot.
@cowabungatime @DLeonhardt @jbarro It sort of is now (not actually, but that's a different issue), but the point here is it makes sense for it to be, and pointing that out isn't an extremist position, nor is pointing out that not doing anything, or making it worse - as is the status quo - isn't helping anything.
@JohnLeFevre Outlandishly dumb take. Journalism and dishonest linkbait content are in different universes.
@jessesingal 'a joke' more like
@cowabungatime @DLeonhardt @jbarro Cutting benefits to rich people who don't need it is not some radical idea. It just makes common sense. Why are we giving social safety net benefits to wealthy people in the first place?
@robbystarbuck @NigeSecurityGuy Amen. A few small ones exist, and the @samforus organization is working on organizing and growing more.
@midclassmoderat @BoxxOfMeng I call coffee and wine.

@NorthCoastFiend @THESagerbomb Those two work far better together than if you tried to do them separately.
@gimmethewooby @davesteinbach If Schultz runs, one will grow out of the organization in 2021, like the Reform Party did after Perot's first run. If not, it'll take many years to build, without that national organization to spark it.
@BoxxOfMeng https://t.co/th0gWIuRdm
@resnicklaw_mark @HowardSchultz The way donation limits to parties work since McCain-Feingold passed years ago - that's not possible, unless he partially self-finances a presidential campaign and that pivots to forming party like with Perot and the Reform Party.
@JakesForLuck @TheRickWilson Amen to that. The org @samforus is working on that.
@Sense4Politics @HowardSchultz @WSJ Like the Reform Party did with Perot, a party will spring from the campaign if he runs. He just can't do both at the same time - the party building begins when the campaign ends
@antihero_kate @VictorFreely @ConceptualJames @disitinerant The org @samforus is working on that.
@DLeonhardt @jbarro mainstream on economic issues, and what we know about what he believes on social issues can in no reasonable way be labeled outside the mainstream without extremely dishonest cherry picking and spin.
@DLeonhardt @jbarro Reality disagrees on both accounts.		Even if you could know his platform based on what little he's said in the last several days, which obviously isn't the case, then his position against the Trump tax cuts and for increasing capital gains (among others) places him well in the

@_Centerleft1999 https://t.co/kAwSc5mmzh
@_Centerleft1999 Seeing people with different beliefs go bonkers doesn't magically change what you believe. If you abandon a belief you claimed to hold merely because someone with a different belief does crazy things, you never really held it in the first place, and its your choice.
That dips deeply into the well of pathological thinking and cult behavior, which is no surprise given the array of other cult-like behavior and pathological rhetoric coming from zealots, and what brain science tells us about the effects of tribalistic identification.
Beyond the slew of examples of how things like reading comprehension and dishonest argumentation are rocketing in the wrong direction in our society, this huge shift is happening among zealot tribes where they increasingly externalize blame for even their own PERSONAL BELIEFS.
@JasonHamiltonUS Point being?		First of all... racism isn't an ideology. It's one belief.		More importantly - they didn't say that racism is right wing. He's criticizing those who are - in essence - making excuses for those who are.
@ORobHarris As a pointed out a couple times in the podcast, these are complementary if done together, not - in any way - mutually exclusive. A large centrist campaign can pull tens of millions currently on the political sidelines to action, and he could drive them toward political reform.
Nailed it.		If someone choses to take extreme and/or bigoted views, that's entirely on them. We all see the same wingnuts and zealots, but the vast majority recognize that it makes no sense to abandon what we believe to fly off to the opposite fringe of some group you despise. https://t.co/OSVwDbRew0

@BulwarkOnline @SykesCharlie Speaking of good design... whoever makes your post banner images is killing it.
@BulwarkOnline @SykesCharlie The sideways 'THE' is a non-issue. You're overthinking that, as well as the bird breaking through the box.		The question is why the bird in the first place, and why in that particular shade of off-yellow?
@BulwarkOnline @SykesCharlie Design isn't my expertise, but I work with logos a lot in my day job, and bring in graphic design people to do logo redesigns regularly... Brown's is odd. Why in the world would his name be the small, and in a color that pops less?
@CharlieCookDC As with the vast majority of candidates, winning is far from the only reason to run. It's possible, but he should do it regardless.
@gainesm @Evolving_Ego @ORobHarris I just couldn't get a straight answer out of any of you, haha
@texasDNP @HowardSchultz Again - he hasn't even launched a campaign yet, and even when campaigns launch, they take months to roll out their platforms, so it's going to be a long time before we know his whole platform, but it's on you to actually inform yourself.
@texasDNP @HowardSchultz He's already talked about working to lower college costs.		Unlike virtually anyone else with power in Washington, he's just honest about what we can and can't afford. It's a complete fairy tale to think we can raise taxes enough to pay for all the things Dems are pushing.
@texasDNP @HowardSchultz Even with the limited stances he's taken...		Nope. For instance, he's said he's for capital gains taxes going up, &amp; came out against the Trump tax cuts when they happened.		He's against single payer, like ~80% of people, for keeping and improving the ACA and lowering drug costs.
@reedgalen funny cuz its true
@jbarro @SirPantsington @yashar I'd buy some Barro-ndi Light Roast
Transpartisan common sense. https://t.co/mhuzb8IVHp
@texasDNP @HowardSchultz You think incorrectly.		He's been a moderate Democrat for a long time. I've been collecting the stances I've found in the interviews he's done, and so far he's landing center-left, as you'd expect from a former moderate Democrat, now left-leaning moderate independent.
@ORobHarris @HowardSchultz Precisely.
If you have a problem with a candidate who is months from deciding if they'll run for president not having more information about their platform than those who are already running, the problem is with you and your bizarrely unreasonable and dumb expectations, not @HowardSchultz.
@Reform4Illinois @OpenSecretsDC Neither of them have done so. They're still taking special interest PAC money. They just are not taking PAC money from people they disagree with.

@Halalcoholism Nailed it.		If someone choses to take extreme, bigoted views, that's entirely on them. We all see the same wingnuts  and zealots, but the vast majority don't choose to become one ourselves in response.
@kaylive Worse, even when people launch campaigns, they take months to roll out their platforms... all this is just nonsense.
@kaylive For one, that's just plain not true, and for two, he's still months away from deciding if he's going to run, and out of the pile of people publicly saying they might run, he's the only one people are pretending should come out with a platform before he even launches a campaign.
@volduckmike @RFShiree @ORobHarris It would be difficult to convince all the states to agree to a system like that.
@volduckmike @RFShiree @ORobHarris That would just result in the better funded candidates winning more than they already do.		It's good to spread them out, and start with smaller states. I just think we should rotate between those smaller states.		Problem is, states decide this themselves.

@PhDbutnotrealDr A bunch of things, but the biggest that comes to mind is they're stuck in a feedback loop.		Move left and you lose more moderates, but gain more progressives, which moves the party left more, which causes more moderates to leave, more progressives to join... rinse, repeat.

@phalanx You're being purposefully dishonest if you think that what you just said conflicts with anything I've said.

Just recorded our second podcast episode, and our first panel discussion - with @gainesm, @Evolving_Ego &amp; @ORobHarris. I discovered a quirk in the service we use to record with people across the country, that led to us losing some of the conversation, but given that...
@melonpost Nobody is being pedantic. If you want to have a substantive conversation with someone, then it doesn't make sense to say one thing, but mean something else.
@melonpost The way people are expecting Schultz to have a platform out before he even launches a campaign is so bizarre.		There are about two dozen candidates publicly thinking about running for office, and Schultz is the only one that people are pretending should have a platform already.
@melonpost ...starting a reply with "But..." signals that what follows somehow contradicts what you're replying to.
@vuhrmeyer @GoodsonLarry I'd settle for taxpayer-funded primaries being open to all of those taxpayers, regardless of party affiliation, or lack thereof.
@ReasonC0alition Add that together w/ the fact that over half who voted for Clinton or Trump said that they didn't actually supported them, but voted against the greater evil &amp; that gives you a huge pool of potential supporters - most of which, though not all, are in the centrist/moderate range.
@phalanx Right... and so that baby is born and alive... like I've been saying this entire time and you've been pretending isn't the case.
@melonpost That doesn't conflict with anything there. Recognizing that one is the greater evil doesn't mean the other represents you.
@FJBoccadoro Because there are about ten miles between them.
A majority of those are in the centrist to moderate range, and more would join as moderates continue to leave the major party tents - that's a bigger pool of voters to draw from than either major party draws from. https://t.co/xKloSlsHio https://t.co/ehyKb2JipH
@phalanx That came before the damning comments, not after. Again - in his own words - he was talking about 3rd trimester abortion rules, then he pivoted to a baby that was born and was alive.
@CenterRealist Definitely will bring this up in the episode.		Also - nice job on the quick draw. You followed the show on Spreaker before even I did, haha
Here's the first episode - sorry for the background noise... wont happen again:		https://t.co/0v5aJmYwTw
Recording the latest episode of our podcast two hours from now. Got any questions, or issues to discuss, related to centrist politics - chime in below.		Also about to post the link to the first episode...
Adults should be free to make these trades if they choose, but Senator @MarkWarner is right about transparency.		While we're on the subject - we need to pass the #HonestAds Act too.
@N5F_B You're right on most of their policy positions, yes - especially if you look at the party, sans Trump. Outside of Trump, where the GOP is now is a natural evolution of where they've been heading for a long time.
@N5F_B I'm not sure if the GOP is changing less, but what change Trump represents compared to Romney, George W., etc is much worse.
That act itself crosses a big red line in my opinion. Adults... fine - their data, their choice if they want to make that trade. But kids? Nah. Legal or not, that strays deep into unethical business practices I think. https://t.co/QDnRWnP3Qs
@N5F_B That's the status quo. If centrists aren't okay with it, then they can't be ignoring it.		Our problem is a lack of campaigns, parties and organizations. Schultz may be the campaign to lay the foundation for that.
@N5F_B We've had a great solution on the table for a long time. In polling 70-80% of the American people support it. It's called the public option.		Unfortunately, no powerful politicians have gotten behind it since Obama dropped it (he ran on it in 08) for the individual mandate in '09
@N5F_B He does have a big mountain to climb. That's the nature of the beast.
@N5F_B On healthcare, he already said that we shouldn't repeal the ACA, but improve on it to lower costs, and get rid of the impediments to negotiating drug prices.		Thinking he should release some sort of platform before he even launches his campaign is unreasonable.
@N5F_B He's offered a bunch of stances already, and he hasn't even launched his campaign yet. People are treating his maybe-pre-campaign book tour more critically then people who have already jumped in the race. It makes no sense.
@N5F_B I don't know any centrists that are okay with said rotten pendulum.
@N5F_B Trump is no champion of political reform. I remember first reading about him thinking of running way back in 2010, and I pegged him as a wingnut all the way back then. Even wrote a blog post about it, calling him a farce.
@N5F_B Schultz came out against those tax cuts - when they happened. and again in the last few days.		Everyone offers ideas. I'm sure we'd agree that most coming from the right, libertarians, people farther left than you, etc aren't what we should do. That doesn't mean they don't exist.
@N5F_B If you think centrists want anything resembling the status quo, you don't know what centrists stand for. The status quo is a rotten pendulum between the left and right.
@N5F_B "But the problem with moderates, centrist, and GOP is that they are offering no solutions."		Only a blind zealot thinks that only their side is offering solutions. Just because I disagree with a lot of ideas on the left, I'd never stoop to saying nonsense like that.
@GoodsonLarry If what is happening proves anything, it's that he's being vetted no less than any other candidate, so that holds no water.
@N5F_B No way to reasonably surmise whether he is yet, one way or the other, but we do certainly know that nobody either major party might nominate is going to run our country well either. At most they offer lesser evils. Schultz may be better than a lesser evil - we'll see.
This sort of stuff is part of what these pre-campaign tours are all about. He's hired a A+ level leadership team - they need to start delivering an A-level pre-campaign.
One related thing that he is doing better than most politicians is, after saying something he didn't mean, clarifying that he didn't mean it instead of playing rhetorical gymnastics.		Keep doing that.		...but cut the unforced errors out, so that's not needed. PRONTO.
Especially speaking as someone who works (in my day job) in online marketing... whoever they gave access to their Twitter account that did that shouldn't be allowed anywhere near public messaging. It was genuinely that obvious of a wrong call.
We all do this, but this is the big leagues. He needs coaching - and fast, and the foolish framing of the Roger Simon post is a minor mistake at this juncture, but it was a glaring, rookie-level mistake.
If anything tanks the possible Schlutz campaign before it even begins, it appears to be off the cuff hyperbolizing and saying things he doesn't mean. Partisan zealots get away with it all of the time, but most independents are less forgiving (as we should be).
@JimSwiftDC @BulwarkOnline @JVLast @SykesCharlie I'm no fan of Christie, but c'mon - that episode title is needlessly petty.

@JonathanCorbin2 He's not acting any differently than a long list of people who might run.
@JonathanCorbin2 He hasn't even launched his campaign, so obviously he's not going to post a platform. Neither have t a slew of people who are considering running, but haven't declared.		Hell, even when candidates launch campaigns, they slowly reveal their platform over the span of the campaign.
@JonathanCorbin2 Now you're stooping to lying about me - I didn't say anything about depth. I'm not even close to deciding if I'd vote for him.		Difference between us is you're jumping to unfounded conclusions and stooping to dishonesty, while I'm watching and learning.
@NYCKNP That's a waste of time. You don't build bridges with people who repeatedly burn them down. You build bridges with the reasonable people.
@mikedwyerwrites Most people who run know they can't win. Winning is far from the only reason to run. Getting important ideas more attention and building things for the future are two that apply here.

@brklynmind @centristSpokane @LouMichels @ScottWRasmussen "because in every non proportional legislature the system pushes people to 2 parties."		Your argument doesn't even conflict with anything I said.
@brklynmind @centristSpokane @LouMichels @ScottWRasmussen "Btw the current POTUS was not liked, invited or encouraged by his current party either."		Moot. Nobody is saying someone who wants to run as a Democrat shouldn't. Schultz isn't because the Democratic Party doesn't represent him.

@brklynmind @centristSpokane @LouMichels @ScottWRasmussen Nobody is saying people couldn't. The whole point here is that it's a pointless endeavor, as the party doesn't represent us, and its base is increasingly hostile to us, and our views.
@brklynmind @centristSpokane @LouMichels @ScottWRasmussen That's not what he said, though in states that aren't open primaries, given that most centrists are independents, the law does.		Spoilers aren't a thing. That's just people trying to shift blame for their own failures.
@LanceSmith1100 Not at all. It's just simple math. There aren't enough moderates left in the party for a moderate to win the presidential nomination. Primary voters are even more skewed to the left than the overall Dem tent, even.
@RichWhy @centristSpokane @ScottWRasmussen ...in a party that centrists have no chance in, that the base rejects and blames for their failures and many of our ideas aren't welcome.		What they're really saying is come sit at the back of our bus, and do what we say, but not what we do.
@JonathanCorbin2 Incorrect. I've collected a list of a couple dozen policy stances he's taken so far. This isn't anything new at all. Politicians do these sorts of tours before they launch campaigns all the time. Schultz is just getting far more attention in the media than most.

@phalanx Incorrect.		I didn't believe it until I read the direct quote, and listened to it myself.		He went from talking about the current law that covers late term abortions to talking about a situation where a baby was born and was alive.

@Dave_is_Central @HowardSchultz I'd vote for that ticket if Hickenlooper was at the top of it. Nobody is defined by one stance, and Hickenlooper's views are predominantly centrist/moderate, as are Hogan's and Schultz'.
@Dave_is_Central @Voters4Kasich @HowardSchultz Playing rhetorical games only highlights your mistake.		Yes, he knows about living paycheck to paycheck, and paying for healthcare.		I've never been poor, or rich, and I've always been insured. Are you prejudiced against me now too?
@1999Progressive Personally, I'd rather they jump on the same ticket and run against whoever the Dems &amp; GOP nominate, but we'll see what happens.
@Dave_is_Central @davideisaacson @HowardSchultz AKA - so what you said earlier doesn't hold any water, so now you're moving the goalposts.		I don't care about the personal stuff. You're free too. Poor, rich, old, young, skin color, gender - I don't care. What matters to me is where they stand.
@Dave_is_Central @Voters4Kasich @HowardSchultz So then, why are you changing the subject?
@AdelineFreedman @Turing_Tested_ @babybeginner @Evolving_Ego They made it pretty clear that they aren't engaging in good faith. I just blocked them.
@Dave_is_Central @HowardSchultz The only other person that seems to be angling toward a run I'd also consider would be Larry Hogan (who'd be good for a running mate with Schultz). I'd love to see him take a bite out of Trump. We'll see if any moderate Dems run - I like Hickenlooper too.
@Dave_is_Central @HowardSchultz I've been a fan of his since long before I knew he was interested in politics. Its way too early to decide if I'd support him (Uniters the organization doesn't endorse - this is just my personal opinion), but I like most of what I've seen so far.
@Dave_is_Central @Voters4Kasich @HowardSchultz Incorrect.
@Dave_is_Central @davideisaacson @HowardSchultz The personal stuff isn't important to me, but if it is to you... you should read about his past before making - in this case mistaken - assumptions.

True. A unhealthy majority of attacks on "centrism" aren't even going after what centrists think. If I can take the time to keep up on what liberals, progressives, cons &amp; libertarians think, they can do the same - they just choose to stick to blind demonization instead. https://t.co/U65bfzc1Iv

@Dividist @theLazyAphorist I suppose... since we already are stuck in the Twilight Zone of political circus, we might as well go all out?

@Ev_1004 @JimStev29459606 @HowardSchultz @rogerlsimon Nobody can catch and remember everything. I just saw what he said and happened to remember Schultz saying this - quick Google search, and happy to help. No mic droppin'.
@AdelineFreedman @Evolving_Ego @Turing_Tested_ As for home.... no party, yet, but I'd check @samforus out, and I hear this Uniters group seems like they've got some neat things cookin', especially if that Solomon guy would manage to learn how to edit audio faster, heh
@Evolving_Ego @veggiescott Same here. I worked in social justice for a bit even - ran a juvenile restorative justice program for a couple years.
@ModManifesto @theLazyAphorist I don't see any amaterishness from him. He just doesn't seem practiced in staying on message in his off the cuff responses in interviews. That'll change with practice and coaching. Whether he gets actually really good at it is another question.
@AdelineFreedman @Evolving_Ego @Turing_Tested_ From what you said, you do sound like you're in the centrist/moderate range, or what I like to call the 'Centrist Big Tent'.
@Evolving_Ego @Turing_Tested_ Problem with that is that is also true of the far/extreme left and right, as well as people in the libertarian / classical liberal spectrum, and whatever you'd call the opposite of libertarian.
@Dividist @theLazyAphorist The one time I found a semi-straight answer from Cuban on that, he said he'd run as a Republican. That would be quite fun to watch.
@BulwarkOnline @SykesCharlie @monacharenEPPC @JimSwiftDC No, but we could start laying the foundation for one.
@TesseractUnfold @ScottWRasmussen Pareto Principle, in reverse?
@DuryeaJosh @HowardSchultz @realDonaldTrump Same here. 2016 was the first time I've never voted in a presidential since I was a teenager.
@gregsbrews We'll see relatively soon. Schultz seems to be circling around it - has already come out against single payer and moving backward on the ACA. Not sure where Biden is single payer vs the option.
@ferguson_twf @AlanStewartCarl Clearly a Scottish troll farmer.
@ferguson_twf @AlanStewartCarl Haggis, hahahaha
@DuryeaJosh @HowardSchultz @realDonaldTrump Only voters can do that. Trump never had a chance of getting my vote, nor do any Democrats with any chance of winning their presidential nomination.
Support for Public Option ideas has been consistently well into the 'rather large supermajority' range since back in 2008 campaign, when the issue really hit the public eye. Different wording, framing and priming has given a range of support levels in the high 60's to low 80's.
Much like abortion polling, where far more people label themselves as 'Pro-Life' than want to illegalize abortion before late-term, the reality here is people don't support single payer - they support a Medicare *OPTION* for All - AKA the 'Public Option'.
#Polling shows few want to bar people from choosing private health insurance if they want to - AKA, strip away the political marketing &amp; support for the policy behind single payer is around 17% - Dems 23%, independents 20% &amp; GOP 6% - @ScottWRasmussen	https://t.co/cnHDzqLePs
@JimStev29459606 @HowardSchultz @rogerlsimon https://t.co/SvuI1SHP9F
@AlanStewartCarl @ferguson_twf I'd buy that for a dollar.
@AlexisinNH @cvcardillo Worth stressing, though, that winning is not only far from the only reason to run, but usually isn't why people run. Most know they have no realistic chance of winning, and I think a Bloomberg primary campaign could have a positive impact, depending on what he focused on.
@OpenSecretsDC @JulianCastro Not a fan of his candidacy, but there isn't anything wrong with this.
@Schultz4America More importantly, the American people don't want it.		They do want the 'Public Option' - the option to choose to buy into a government-run plan, but also have the option of choosing private insurance, and leveraging employer-provided insurance to spread the cost out.
@theLazyAphorist On that I disagree. Substance is far more important to me, but I think Schultz' tone is far better... far more - for lack of a better way of putting it that I can think of right now - 'presidential'.
@realponyhill @jbarro That's a version of the public option (that I agree with), not single payer.
@brklynmind @AlanStewartCarl comment, really doesn't. He needs coaching on that, and fast.
@brklynmind @AlanStewartCarl ...blog post eventually.		He seems to be, in a sense, 'market testing' certain talking points - though I'm not sure it's intentional in some cases. A lot of the time, he seems to be talking off the cuff, which works some of the time, and others - like the un-American healthcare
@brklynmind @AlanStewartCarl I've got a couple dozen stances collected so far. Just for my personal curiosity, to see if he'll earn my conditional support, at this point, but I'll find the time to make it into a
@MsMelChen The vast majority of the time, in my experience, just getting content from the source, giving it a trim and new suit - so to speak - works a lot better, gets better results/ROI and helps people get to know the person or project being promoted better.
@MsMelChen Far too often, PR people will take content, strip it of far too much of the substance, replace it with promotional fluff and/or gin it up with so my hyperbole, spin and/or bluster to try and grab attention.
@hale_razor He eats brand-name Cheerios? That monster.
@AlexisinNH @cvcardillo There used to be enough moderates in the Democratic tent to make something like a Bloomberg candidacy a potential winner, if enough things went wrong for the rest of the competition, but it's just not there anymore.
@brklynmind @AlanStewartCarl False on all accounts. You're making the bizarre assumption that just because you haven't seen him do a thing, he hasn't done it.		I've been collecting policy stances he's made in interviews over the last few days. Mostly good. Needs help with delivery and rhetoric.
@nifi22 @ReaganBattalion That's happening right in front of our eyes, and even if it wasn't, that doesn't make what I said any less true.		Also, neither party is interested in anything resembling a 'compromise campaign'... which is moot anyway, as that's not what we're talking about.
@BoxxOfMeng @caro @Evolving_Ego Right, because box wine is snobbish, haha
@AlanStewartCarl Having seen all the main arguments, and his responses so far, I agree with him on substance. Certainly could use more help in crafting better worded and polished responses, though.
@theLazyAphorist I don't see how that translates into needing him, but he's certainly more famous, from Shark Tank and other public stuff he's done, more bombastic and aggressive.
@MsMelChen Speaking as someone who works in online marketing, and has done work in politics... I completely agree. PR people might be worse than - *GASP* - lawyers. For the most part, they make everything they touch worse. A sizable portion of marketing people do as well, in my experience.
@RamCNN @gsparks94 Namely - only if it's a choice, not the only option. In other words, they don't actually support 'Medicare for All' or 'Single Payer' - they support the 'Public Option'

@nifi22 @ReaganBattalion If that were true, the Democratic and Republican parties wouldn't exist. Both began as third parties.
@ReaganBattalion The @samforus organization is building that, and the @HowardSchultz campaign can be piggybacked (just like major parties do with their presidential campaigns) to grow a national party.
@theLazyAphorist I don't see how someone who call himself a libertarian-esque Republican would be what we're looking for.

@veggiescott @Evolving_Ego You think if you just say something we know to be false enough times, it magically becomes true? Let's find out, haha
@Turing_Tested_ @Evolving_Ego If you have a street, and my house happens to fall in the center third of that street, it's address isn't defined by those around it any more than any of the others are to each other.
@Turing_Tested_ @Evolving_Ego We're talking about political science here, not clannishness. Come on now - no need for that nonsense.
@Kasich4Indiana @jrfunke I will gladly double tap your Instagram pics, heh
@Turing_Tested_ @Evolving_Ego Obviously not. The center is just an area on a spectrum. It's not any more defined by others as those others are by it. They all are merely in relation to each other in different ways.
@veggiescott @Evolving_Ego Yet another perfect illustration. I'm not minimizing anything. I read what he actually said, while you - of your own admission - interpreted what he said, and - it turns out - incorrectly.
@Turing_Tested_ @Evolving_Ego I already said how. You look at the bell curve / standard distribution and move out from there.
@Kasich4Indiana @jrfunke Looks like sticky boredom to me.		If we're talking vacation - I'd rather spend time in a cabin, out in the sticks somewhere.
@Turing_Tested_ @Evolving_Ego Same here. Have a degree in it. Have continued studying since, and have talked to experts in the field recently to make sure I use a data/reality-based spectrum.
@Kasich4Indiana @jrfunke I'm thinking Philly is next for me. Maybe in a year and a half. We'll see. Not into tropical places.
@veggiescott @Evolving_Ego Perfect illustration - he merely said "social justice crowd", which you slathered with negative tone, ignored what he actually said and read "SJW".
@Kasich4Indiana @jrfunke If it wasn't so damn expensive to live there in comparison, I'd switch in a heartbeat. Honestly, the cold doesn't bother me much. I walked to a store six block away in 20 degree weather last week... in sandals, sans socks. I run hot, so cold feels good most of the time.

@TeriPoulton You didn't get the memo that we're supposed to hate people who aren't the same as us.
@Kasich4Indiana @jrfunke oy
@veggiescott @Evolving_Ego ...my point exactly.
@Turing_Tested_ @Evolving_Ego By looking at where the middle of the bell curve of political belief is in a given nation. The spectrum of belief among a people defines said spectrum. Labels don't.
@Turing_Tested_ @Evolving_Ego Labels don't define opinions. That's now how that works.
@Kasich4Indiana @jrfunke I'm definitely not leaving the house until Thursday. It's in single digits until then in KC.
@caro @Evolving_Ego https://t.co/4epc4xWU6g
@Evolving_Ego @veggiescott Reading comprehension has really gone down hill in our culture... more and more people completely ignore the words people actually use, and only are able to see things they project between the lines.
@Turing_Tested_ @Evolving_Ego That's not who centrists are. No segment of the political spectrum is defined by others any more or less than any of the rest.
@CalmesJr History does not reflect that, as we have already discussed. We just plain can't know either way, until they're in the job. What we can know is what they stand for.
@jamiblakeley108 I work in online marketing. Trolls don't know that they often help the people they think they're hurting with their trolling.
@jamiblakeley108 @HowardSchultz Nobody can predict what will happen this far out, but the only people who can hand Trump another victory are voters - not candidates running to represent groups of people the two major parties have abandoned.

@ind4bernie2016 @TheReportersNet So would I, but a moderate Dem winning the Democratic nomination is even less likely than Schultz winning as an independent.
@DavidJollyFL @Dander_Bogaerts Putting #CountryOverParty is a betrayal when you're a member of a cult of personality.
@ind4bernie2016 @TheReportersNet Bad one, and would be a big flip flop, given what he's already said in just the last couple days.
@MattyC2213 Wind in the trees does it for me.
@ind4bernie2016 @TheReportersNet He didn't say why until later, I don't think. From what he's said, it doesn't seem like it matters which will run  because he'll choose to run or not a long time before the Dems choose their nominee.
@MattyC2213 Mine has gazebo areas, bathrooms and outlets, but it's in the woods, and with fun people.
@ind4bernie2016 @TheReportersNet I hope he does, no matter who the Dems run.
@ind4bernie2016 @TheReportersNet How would Schultz have any sway over who the Dems nominate?
@MattyC2213 I do a one week glamping trip each year, in May. Keeps me sane.
@MarcGoldwein Wait... so... you're telling me that blaming them for Democrats' failures and saying they're bad people for disagreeing won't make them want to vote for you?
@davideisaacson @HowardSchultz That is indeed how it works. The electoral college just means the impact of that is bigger in some places than others, on the overall election. Doesn't change the fact that if you lose, it's your fault, not anyone else's.
@ind4bernie2016 @TheReportersNet Longshot, but viable. Also would likely kickstart a national centrist party. I don't see it helping Dems much, if at all.
A healthy democracy, freshly brewed coffee and nice company. What else should we give Jimbo here? https://t.co/XvIgG3CQTU
@Evolving_Ego Democracy, fresh coffee and nice company.
@davideisaacson @HowardSchultz Today is Tuesday. So what?
@davideisaacson @HowardSchultz If the DNC loses support, that's their own fault, not Schultz' for earning support from people that the DNC has chosen to abandon.
@davideisaacson @HowardSchultz If you don't want to vote for Schultz, then don't. Same as I'd never vote for any of the Dems with any chance of winning the Dem nod, or Trump.
@davideisaacson @HowardSchultz That's not how democracy works - you've got it backward. If a candidate runs and doesn't earn enough votes to win, their loss is their own fault. Nobody else's.
@davideisaacson @HowardSchultz We don't get to make that choice. We just get to choose among options that decide to run, and he's the only option I'd even consider voting for who looks like he's going to run. I'd also consider Hickenlooper and / or Hogan, bit neither of them can win their respective primaries.
@davideisaacson @HowardSchultz Exactly nothing. That's neither here, nor there. Perot had far less, in a time where the divide was much smaller, against stronger competition, less partisan dysfunction and he was a weaker candidate.
@davideisaacson @HowardSchultz You may believe on supporting lesser evils, but I don't, and never will again.
@davideisaacson @HowardSchultz Obviously. That's no reason not to do it.
@davideisaacson @HowardSchultz You mean earning votes, that people choose to cast for him vs others.
@davideisaacson @HowardSchultz How could you? He hasn't even launched his campaign yet.
@davideisaacson @HowardSchultz (then he tanked his own campaign by dropping out, then un-dropping out)
@sane_democrat I can't say I agree. Likes and retweets often go to fluffier content that is just bite sized sugary content, and/or that inflame the right audience. And we shouldn't punish content just because a troll army ratios it.

@alasurstrigis @traxattack @HowardSchultz Misread.		It's a position that 80% of the country agrees with - all over the spectrum, not just us in the middle, but the vast majority of people.
@alasurstrigis @traxattack @HowardSchultz No, you're not.		The Kaiser poll was testing the effect of political marketing messages. Those were primed answers. Prime them the opposite way and the numbers would go down - that's how priming works.		The poll I showed asked the question directly.
@danato84 @HowardSchultz @amyklobuchar @MitchLandrieu @clairecmc You keep arguing with things nobody is saying. Nobody is arguing for anyone to quit the fight.		I'm not a Democrat. I'll never be a Dem again. I think the party is corrupt to it's gills, and the only more harmful entity in the country is the GOP. That's why I'm an independent.
@alasurstrigis @traxattack @HowardSchultz "Every American should have a choice between buying their insurance from the government or a private company" is literally what the public option means.
@alasurstrigis @traxattack @HowardSchultz You really aren't listening. The whole point here is that polling data proves that people don't understand the difference between these things if you just give them the names of them. You have to ask about the policies themselves to find out where they stand.
@alasurstrigis @traxattack @HowardSchultz It's an opinion 80% of the country agrees with, including a great many Democrats, but your leaders are pushing single payer instead - that's the whole point here.
@alasurstrigis @traxattack @HowardSchultz Prime them with messaging against it, and it'd probably be lower. That only proves that political messaging can have short term effects on peoples' opinions, which is obvious.
@alasurstrigis @traxattack @HowardSchultz Asked differently, after some priming, and still most are against it.
@tdpubs In some ways. That was an incredibly corrupt era as well. Less vitriol from politicians in public, but far more violence, etc.
@alasurstrigis @traxattack @HowardSchultz That doesn't tell us what people support. That tells us which is the lesser evil between options you deign to choose for them.		When asked about all the choices, what gets the most support - by far - is the public option.
@alasurstrigis @traxattack @HowardSchultz Given that that isn't what I said, I'm not sure what your point even is here.		Single payer means "Every American should be required to use the government insurance program" - that's literally what single payer means, and it gets 19% support.
@danato84 @HowardSchultz @amyklobuchar @MitchLandrieu @clairecmc They are, and never haven't been. They've just lost.
@Marti_in_DE @teetallent That's most likely closer to reality on this. The media doesn't call the shots in presidential debates. Debate rules are determined by a board (forget the name), and that board is controlled by party insiders, not media people.
@NomeDaBarbarian @HowardSchultz That's reality. No faith involved.
@alasurstrigis @traxattack @HowardSchultz The source is literally in the screenshot.
@danato84 @HowardSchultz @amyklobuchar @MitchLandrieu @clairecmc Given that nobody is arguing that we should, I'm not sure what your point is. We're doing the smart thing and building something new in the center.
@xcaliburrnity "Guys, maybe people like what she says and her poise thus far?"		Obviously. And? I didn't say anything about the rest of that nonsense you read between the lines.
@NomeDaBarbarian @HowardSchultz It has a party on the left, and a left wing party that isn't very strong, as their views don't reflect very many.
@alasurstrigis @traxattack @HowardSchultz Here it is. https://t.co/Jksihkfa2J
@alasurstrigis @traxattack @HowardSchultz That poll didn't explain the policies, which is my point. Few do, leading to widespread misconceptions, like this.
@tdpubs Nature of the beast. Has been true as far back as we have written accounts of politics. Theodore Roosevelt's 'Man in the Arena' speech probably said it best.
@NomeDaBarbarian @HowardSchultz You seem to be arguing with a figment of your imagination here.
@NomeDaBarbarian @HowardSchultz That's not the American political spectrum. That's a map of ideological belief.
@xcaliburrnity Every single elected who has been in DC for more than a few months has added a mountain of debt with their votes. Every single one - Democrat, Republican and independent.
@danato84 @HowardSchultz @amyklobuchar @MitchLandrieu @clairecmc I'm a fan. I was happy to vote for her last year. Zero chance running for the Democratic presidential nomination.
@Alexfielder801 @verplanckcolvin @HowardSchultz Of course you bailed after it was clear you had no leg to stand on. The Democratic Party was founded in the 1820's, and the GOP was founded in the 1850's - proving my point. We literally do have that option.
@danato84 @HowardSchultz @amyklobuchar @MitchLandrieu I wouldn't call Klobuchar a moderate - more a liberal that compromises. I don't know enough about Landrieu to comment.		Well known, genuine moderates like Mark Warner and Claire McCaskill stand zero chance of winning in a Democratic national primary.
@Alexfielder801 @verplanckcolvin @HowardSchultz Changing the subject only highlights that you were wrong.		They do. They also go through periods of change, otherwise, the Democratic and Republican parties wouldn't exist - both began as 3rd parties.
@em_div @HowardSchultz Don't vote for him then. Being an underdog isn't a reason not to run.
@NomeDaBarbarian @HowardSchultz Objectively false.		The political spectrum is defined by the people, and Democrats stand predominantly on the left.
@sallutephilipe @HowardSchultz Organizations of all sorts pay for Twitter ads.
@Alexfielder801 @verplanckcolvin @HowardSchultz No need. You said we don't have the option. We literally do.
@danato84 @HowardSchultz You said you disagree, but nothing that follows conflicts with anything I've said.		Of course it's hard. It's just impossible to win in a major party primary.
@deankrimmel @Voters4Kasich @HowardSchultz What's baloney is pretending you believe in democracy, while really just believing in it when it gives you results you like. Unlike you, I'd never stoop to saying someone else shouldn't have a candidate that represents them to vote for.
@Alexfielder801 @verplanckcolvin @HowardSchultz Reality disagrees.
@gibsopi @alasurstrigis @traxattack @HowardSchultz Classy.
@gibsopi @alasurstrigis @traxattack @HowardSchultz That's a policy that a lot of people support - no single group owns it, any more than any of the others.
@Alexfielder801 @HowardSchultz Because some moderates, in both parties, are more likely to like him than the candidate their party nominates. We'll see how many.
@Alexfielder801 @HowardSchultz Quite the opposite. The gap between the parties was small 30 years ago. It's several times larger now, and just about every political problem is worse.
@verplanckcolvin @Alexfielder801 @HowardSchultz Not left wing is still miles from centrist. Most of the left isn't left wing.
@danato84 @HowardSchultz No point. Like most moderates, he's realized that we have no future, and our views aren't welcome, in either major party's tent.
@alasurstrigis @traxattack @HowardSchultz What the vast majority of people support is the public option, among other reforms.
@alasurstrigis @traxattack @HowardSchultz Incorrect.		Healthcare, for instance: only ~20% agree with single payer when the policy is explained in a poll. It only seems like more because so many people don't understand that Medicare for All doesn't allow for people to choose private insurance if they want.
@deankrimmel @Voters4Kasich @HowardSchultz Him thinking of running is no more hubristic than any other candidate running. If you want an example of hubris, then look at those who think that their side is entitled to votes, instead of recognizing that in a democracy, votes have to be earned.
@Alexfielder801 @HowardSchultz As he's already said several times, he can't do that because he'd have to pretend he believes things that he doesn't to do so.
@danato84 @HowardSchultz Not at all. A lot of those people have already left their respective parties, and those that haven't stick with what they see as the lesser evil. Not enough to win inside their tent doesn't mean it's not enough to make waves, combined with centrist independents.
@JoeThrashnkill @HowardSchultz Classy.
I definitely do it more than I should, but one reason why you want to attract and engage with trolls in your comments is... it ads to your content's virility. Each troll comment brings more traffic, because of the way Twitter's algo works.
@NEVADA4SHANNON @HowardSchultz Only better time than now would have been 2016.

@CalmesJr That's not an opinion. Being in Congress isn't executive government experience, and even if it were, the fact that people with more were bad presidents proves my point that that experience isn't predictive of whether they'll be good or not.
@burevestnik3 That doesn't even conflict with what I said, haha
@traxattack @HowardSchultz Just a candidate running to represent the views of tens of millions of people neither party care about, same as whoever you support does for you.
@tinaweit Someone's been drankin' the Kook-Aid.
@burevestnik3 And? That's obvious. That's why the party has attracted more and more progressives, and moderates are going independent.
@erasmusNYT We didn't have a horse in the race. Democrats blew it, with help from Putin &amp; Co.
@Photogkris I'm not as pessimistic as you, but I do think Schultz is the best candidate we've seen so far.

@MiiNi_mB Free as a bird.
@theweaselborne @darksn4ke Heaven forbid, people actually wanting someone on the ballot that represents them.
@Hunter_T_Powell Stay classy.
@LittleAngus ...but even better, and he's running at a time when the chasm between the parties is twice as wide, the parties are far worse, the American people are sicker of the significantly more acute partisan dysfunction.
@DrewWRogers False choice, and there is no point in running for the nomination of a party that doesn't represent us.
@darksn4ke Centrists have no chance of winning in the Dem presidential primaries. The party doesn't represent us.
@darksn4ke That's a fairy tale. As he's said, to do so, he'd have to say he supported things that he knows "in my heart I don't believe, and would have to be disengenuous" to run as a Democrat
@peggyayoung @RobertMaguire_ @HowardSchultz His long interview with Sorkin on CNBC last night was even better, I think. Got more stances out of it.
@DrewWRogers It's not anyone's place to speak for anyone else.
@DrewWRogers Cry me a river. You said I failed to state something that was plain to see.		And more power to you. Unlike people like you, I think everyone should have candidates that represent them on the ballot.
@CalmesJr Lincoln, JFK - neither had executive experience either.		And again - a number of presidents considered to be bad did.		The reality is it's not predictive.
@DavidMatheny1 No one thing is "the answer". No person possibly could be. No party could be.		The question is whether he'd do the job well and represent centrists.		The risk is a product of our corrupt system. Independents running is merely a byproduct of that.
@DrewWRogers Most people aren't as dense as you, and know what I was referring to when I said he wasn't a Democrat.		I don't speak for anyone but myself, same as everyone else.
@tdpubs Even more - I think the one will help the other, both directions.
@tdpubs I've been a supporter of instant runoffs since way back when I first learned about it over a decade ago. As I said, my only issue here is how you posed them as one being better than the other, when they aren't - in any way - mutually exclusive or conflicting.
@1999Liberal @HowardSchultz Harm the people who work at a business that treats it's employees well, to hurt someone who doesn't even work there anymore / pwn the indies! haha
@tdpubs They aren't right (a constitutional republic is one, of many, forms of democracy), and I am thinking of the electoral college, and beyond.		Nobody owns a vote except voters, so they can't be split because they were never anyone's to begin with.
...not to mention centrist independents!		Win or lose, we can build something lasting in the center. Just like every party does, piggybacking party growth with their presidential campaigns, we have to do the same, and build something lasting if @HowardSchultz runs.
Accurate: “I think lifelong Democrats and many, many more lifelong Republicans than Democrats realize are looking for a home” - @HowardSchultz https://t.co/jSIjIGRiQa
@MichaelZee0 @1999Liberal I would never stoop to that level. See, I actually believe in and support democracy. Even though I don't support your party, the GOP, Greens, Libertarians, etc - unlike you, I'd never argue against them running candidates that want to represent them in government.
@MichaelZee0 @1999Liberal Lying won't work here. Saying we don't deserve people in office who represent us is miles beyond the pale. You don't get to tell people they shouldn't get representation like you have, and pretend you're civil. You're just another blind party hack.
@MichaelZee0 @1999Liberal Another illustration of your ignorance.		Both the Democratic and Republican parties began as third parties. If what you said was true, neither of them would exist today.
@1999Liberal @MichaelZee0 That's the goal.
@MichaelZee0 @1999Liberal about what people across the spectrum think. Understanding takes time and effort, and can't be delivered to you in little tweet-length packets.
@MichaelZee0 @1999Liberal Note how I'm not trying to make this personal, and badger you? If you're so willfully ignorant that you don't know what people in other areas of the spectrum think, that's your problem. Like anyone who tries to understand others, I've spent a lot of time over the years learning
@MichaelZee0 @1999Liberal No less than anyone else.
@1999Liberal @MichaelZee0 We can only do what we can in the party we're in. It's up to them to reform themselves - which isn't going to happen, given that they don't have any interest in reforming, so all we can do is build something better in the center, and fight corruption from controlling our party.
@MichaelZee0 @1999Liberal Given your lack of civility just in this thread, it's no wonder you don't support democracy.		I don't support evils of any kind.
@MichaelZee0 @1999Liberal ...and a bigot on top of your anti-democracy views.		Are you dense? It literally says what I am in my name here.
@1999Liberal @MichaelZee0 Too late for that. Both major parties are past the point of no-return, but the GOP is farther over the edge.
@1999Liberal @MichaelZee0 Not easily. Spectacularly hard, but possible. Even if he doesn't win, it's building the foundation for future elections, and helps good candidates down-ballot.
@MichaelZee0 @1999Liberal And? Both are miles beyond the pale. The GOP being farther doesn't make the Dems' corruption magically go away.		We have chosen a side - ours. Your corrupt, out of touch party has gone to great lengths over the last decade to make it clear you don't represent us.
@MichaelZee0 @1999Liberal AKA - 'democracy for me, but not for thee'		Typical selfish partisan - you only pretend you support democracy, so long as it produces results you like.		Your party doesn't represent us, so we have to run people who do. We deserve representation no less than you.
@MichaelZee0 @1999Liberal That's right. Neither party can be trusted with enough power to unilaterally push through their own agendas.
@mikedwyerwrites @OnstottRachel @1999Liberal Some are. Most are waiting to learn more (like me), or aren't.		The personal nonsense most of these attacks are based in just highlights how weak their arguments are. Fact is, they don't believe in democracy, unless it gives them an outcome they like.
@MichaelZee0 @1999Liberal Trying to move the goal posts only highlights how what I said was true. Both are well beyond the pale, and yes indeed - there are dishonest independents as well. Dishonesty is a human frailty - has nothing to do with what tribe you're in.
@CalmesJr Both are excellent examples of how the truth here is that no past experience can predict whether someone will do well in the the Oval Office. We've had lackluster or worse with tons of experience, and good presidents who had none.
@MichaelZee0 @1999Liberal False choice. It's obviously not one or the other, but rather BOTH, and so so many other things in the mix as well.		Also - Democrats are spectacularly prevalent liars as well.
@mikedwyerwrites If their side is so weak that some competition makes you go into fits, like the Democrats are doing - the problem is in their house, not with those who just want what they have... people on the ballot that actually represent them.
@1999Liberal @ajnos16 @mikedwyerwrites That's right. You can't divide a thing that isn't together in the first place.
@MauraLeeLang The article is about why someone like him could win, not rolling out a platform for a campaign he hasn't even launched yet, and he's given a number of policy stances in interviews he's done in the last couple days.
@island_girl421 @adawgma @lindajkillian @DavidJollyFL More in some places, less in others, but we have to actually pay for it - not just keep stealing from the future and undercut the economic futures of our kids.

@susanmitch7 @bernybelvedere Nice conspiracy theory, but alas - this has been going a long time longer than Schultz's maybe-campaign.
@coachtodaro @GovLarryHogan @WhiteHouse @NBCNews I don't think he has any chance of beating Trump in the GOP primary, but he could take a big bite out of his campaign, then maybe join with @HowardSchultz's campaign as his VP.  Either way, I've heard great things about him too.
@tdpubs Obvious example of a false choice.		Votes can't be splintered. That's not how democracy works.
@jefflawson65 @StuPolitics That doesn't even come close.
@jefflawson65 @DavidJollyFL If your party can't earn the support of it's own voters, that's their own fault, and nobody else's.
@CalmesJr Like George W. Bush did?		Eisenhower did fine without it.
Another reason why the entitled lamentations of those who blame independents for their own electoral failures rings hollow. There wouldn't be so many independents if they represented us.		We only want what they have - representation in government. They don't get it both ways. https://t.co/nAGQMVosZ3

@jrfunke Not as big a challenge to Biden or Sanders as the buzz seems to indicate then, you think?
@JRubinBlogger You're focusing on personal nonsense. The rationale is he represents people who neither party cares about anymore.
@jrfunke That bad?

Highlights the truth well - in reality, a candidate can't spoil an election just by running, because candidates and parties don't own votes until the moment they are cast. If a candidate/party fails to earn enough votes to win, that is *THEIR* failure - nobody else's. https://t.co/f0FzRszi77

@DavidJollyFL I'm happy that this is the reaction the hacks are vomiting his way. That's just the sort of BS that has driven so many of us out of their party. They don't respect democracy, or the fact that other people - go figure - want people on the ballot who represent them.
@willfleet @1kathyr In reality, those pretending they know what is going to happen this far out are just lying to themselves. There is no way to know. It's all just conjecture.
@willfleet @1kathyr Speculation. If Schultz runs, &amp; his platform pans out as center-left, then w/ the gap bwtn the parties 2x bigger than '92, he'd probably do better than Perot, &amp; given how soft the center-right is with Trump, he may well take more from the right than left, esp w/ a center-right VP
@studiocafebleu In related news, jumping into the ocean will get you wet.
@lindajkillian @DavidJollyFL A centrist has zero chance of winning the Democratic nomination now.
@studiocafebleu Again - that's not how Democracy works. Only voters get to decide where their vote belongs.
@Champthinks2 If Dems lose, that's their own failure, same as any other campaign/party - nobody else's.		This is a democracy. Nobody owns anyone's votes until they're cast.
@kristianwithak This isn't cable news. Do you have a serious question?
@studiocafebleu That's nothing more than empty speculation.
@thecopelandfam @JohnAvlon That's just it... the rule doesn't create that environment. Their failure to do their jobs does. This isn't a bad thing any more than saying that someone who has most any other job wont get paid if they don't do it.
@TheAssylum1 @JayarJackson @annalecta @skrmhlz Pico si puede!
@studiocafebleu That election illustrates my point, and every major factor that led to Perot doing so well is worse now, and Schultz is a stronger candidate.
@TheAssylum1 @RobertMaguire_ One of them, yep.
@studiocafebleu Obviously not, given that math can't tell us anything yet.
@studiocafebleu I haven't made an evaluation. I'm pointing out the fact that we don't have even a fraction of the facts necessary to even engage in vague speculation yet.

Also true. https://t.co/Yfz4vPhbg7
@studiocafebleu Objectively false. Only voters own votes, &amp; decide where they should go. Parties and campaigns don't own votes - they have to EARN votes. If they don't earn enough to win, that's their own failure, not anyone else's for trying to earn support for their campaign. That's democracy.
@studiocafebleu Why are you being purposefully dense? I'm ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION about what I meant when I said Dems made their own bed.		Makes no sense to run for the nomination of a party that doesn't represent us.
@BabsT42624912 @lisamurkowski Murkowski already technically ran as an independent, and was so strongly supported that she won as a write-in... that never happens, though she re-joined the GOP after, and caucuses with them, she's their most unreliable vote in the Senate.
@BabsT42624912 @lisamurkowski She's defintitely in my top 3 VP choices, along with Larry Hogan (mentioned above) and Charlie Baker. Baker and Murkowski haven't said they're thinking of running, but both are popular moderates - Baker is the most popular governor in the entire country (Hogan is second).
@BabsT42624912 @Oprah I have no idea what her politics are, but you want to balance out the ticket with someone who is a right leaning moderate, and since he's not a politician, it would be best to have someone who is as VP.
@studiocafebleu You can't split a vote. If Dems lose, that's their fault for not earning enough votes to win.
@Champthinks2 Now is the best time in over a hundred years.
@studiocafebleu No it doesn't. We're talking about Schultz - a long time moderate Democrat, who - like millions of others on the center-left, have gone independent as the party has moved farther left.
@will_buckskin Exactly. Never for private projects of any kind.
@studiocafebleu ...then you didn't read what I said.
@AdelineFreedman Will do :)		I think I might have the pilot of the podcast up by tomorrow.
@AdelineFreedman I'm done voting for lesser evils. We may yet get more options in the center, but I like what I see so far.
Truth: "Something tells me that if lawmakers are the ones not getting paid in the shutdown, instead of federal workers, it'd happen a lot less often." - @JohnAvlon // #NoBudgetNoPay #FixNotFight	https://t.co/SMmLUciBko
@AdelineFreedman You always want to balance out your ticket. An old liberal like Biden should pick a younger, more progressive candidate (another mistake Clinton made), from a different part of the country.		Picking a liberal VP would be a mistake Wouldn't help his chances much, if at all.
@PaSwede One of many. We don't even know most of the broad strokes of his platform yet.
@kristianwithak I don't have one. It's an inherently pointless endeavor to engage in this depth of conjecture. We don't even know if Trump will be in office by then, how damaged Mueller will leave him if he survives, what mistakes Biden or Schultz would make, or even Schultz' platform FFS.
@JohnAvlon @CNN @PoppyHarlowCNN @jimsciutto @SenKamalaHarris @HowardSchultz Is there a sharable clip of that somewhere?
Speaking of which - There are several good options for a center-right moderate VP candidates (Murkowski, Baker, etc), but Larry Hogan stands out, as he already seems interested in running against Trump - he could soften him up in the GOP primary, then jump on the Schultz ticket.
Take that, add a center-right VP, &amp; there really is no reasonable way to predict whether he'd take more from the Dem than Trump, this far out.		Regardless, Dems made this bed, now they're pretending they're victims of a situation of their own making.
Even Nate Silver pointed out that there are reasons to believe that he'd pull from both left and right-leaners.		Also, Trump is really soft with right leaners, and an increasing number of non-extreme conservatives.
One leading indicator as to how segments of the electorate will react to a candidate is how pundits in that space react.		No surprise that lib &amp; prog Dems (or con GOP) aren't a fan of @HowardSchultz, but he's getting positive press from #NeverTrump #ExGOP &amp; center-right types.
@kristianwithak No reasonable person would be able to make predictions like this any time soon.
@kristianwithak If I had to bet, I'd say Biden.
@kristianwithak Not very many. Trump couldn'd have won just a cycle or two back, nor would progressives had a shot of winning the Democratic nomination. Independents are in the same place.
@kristianwithak I've been talking about practical reality this whole time - I'm talking about how democracy works. Parties and campaigns don't own votes. Voters do.
@kristianwithak Change it that way, and you just made my point, not yours. The only people who have any say in who deserves a vote are voters. If enough choose not to vote for someone to win, that's not anyone else's fault but their own for not earning enough to win.
@HowardSchultz Amen. Show us your centrist substance on your platform, and you'll find a lot of people interested in supporting you.
@davidfrum Maybe, but the real hope is that his campaign takes the two party system down a few pegs... if not more.
One of the big reasons, sure. At least the vast majority of these hacks have moved on from the 'centrists don't exist' nonsense, heh https://t.co/ECVEP21pgK

@aliconig You might have tried saying that, instead of that ridiculous straw man.
@kristianwithak More independents run every year precisely because the two major parties don't represent us anymore. That was their choice, and this is the natural effect to that cause. If they don't earn enough votes to win, that's their failure.
@kristianwithak You are. For something to be robbed, it first has to be owned by someone else. Outside of election fraud, and the like, a competing candidate cannot rob votes - they merely earn them, or don't. They were never anyone's but the voters.
@middletyn Except you're wrong. Sad as it is, the Trump campaign targeted the current GOP base better than any campaign in a long time. No moderate could win in either, without lying about who they are and what they stand for.
@xcaliburrnity No, the Dems lost Florida for themselves, because they did not earn enough to win.		I'd argue that 2016 might be different because fraud can be reasonably said to spoil an election, but merely losing votes to competitors cannot.
@xcaliburrnity Moot. That's not what you said, nor what I am talking about.
@aliconig I responded directly and respectfully. Do you have a serious question, or are you really as dense as you're making yourself out to be right now?		As is lightyears beyond obvious, Trump and the GOP are the greater evil.
@xcaliburrnity If it's accurate - and it is, then it cannot also be wrong.
@middletyn Obviously, because moderates have no chance of winning in either party's presidential primary.
@aliconig The Democrats with any chance of winning can't lose my vote, because they have already made it abundantly clear they do not deserve it. Howard Schultz may, or someone else may. Too early to tell.
@aliconig It's not merely the extremes I cannot stand, but also the corrupt, out of touch and - highlighted by the reactions of so many on the left - those who believe that they own voters.
@xcaliburrnity He is not anywhere near a libertarian, and if Dems fail to earn enough votes to win, that's their failure. In a democracy, candidates and parties down own votes - they earn them.
@AlliancePartyOH Gas taxes should only be used for roads. Nothing else. Roads are already ruefully underfunded.

@kristianwithak There it is. You think that parties or candidates literally own the electorate.		That's the real difference here. I recognize that the people own their votes. The people decide elections.		That mentality is one - of a great many - reasons why they don't deserve our votes anymore.
@firewall_us Excellent! You're on our short list for that, and we want to do an episode on corruption at least quarterly (I'd like to shoot for every other month) - DM me with specific people and I'll get back to you when we have an episode we need that sort of guest for.
@kristianwithak Both parties have abandoned the center. With so few centrists left in the parties, there is no chance that a centrist could win a Democratic or Republican primary, while centrists made up ~30-40% of the electorate.		The parties only have themselves to blame for this.
@reedgalen Hurt a company that treats its employees well, to own the indies.

@celiacole18 @GeoCommonSense @DavidJollyFL @soledadobrien The only time better than now would have been 2016, or 2012, or 2008. It's long past time for this to happen, and given how rare it is, we can't pass it up, and wait another 28 years.
@ItsMeBobbieD @GeoCommonSense @DavidJollyFL @soledadobrien Perot caused the parties to come toward the center for a while. A more flawed candidate got almost 20%, in a time when the division and dysfunction was a fraction of as bad as it now, and still a party formed around him. They just weren't ready - now we are.
@browntailedhawk @mrlautenschlage Your first question is something nobody outside of his inner circle can know, candidates don't decide elections - voters do, and it's garbage like this that is part of why I don't support the corrupt, out of touch legacy parties any more.
@browntailedhawk @mrlautenschlage A degree in political science, many years of grassroots volunteering, some work in politics - yes, I am.
@PiccolaDonnina @DavidJollyFL @soledadobrien That's not what the tweet said. I can't respond to what you don't say.
The only way to spoil an election is through fraud anyway, but nobody can predict what would happen with any accuracy at this point, given that we don't know if he's running, much of his platform, who the Dem, Green &amp; Libertarians will be, or how damaged Trump will be by then. https://t.co/R8kVGfMBQY

@Chrisvance123 @JohnKasich @jwgop Hogan is a much more popular governor, and actually a moderate, and Schultz has nothing to do with Kasich, so waiting for him makes no sense.
@TeriPoulton @DavidJollyFL @soledadobrien Preach. I've been saying that for years. It's just people blaming others for their failures.

@1kathyr @willfleet Perot got ~20% against stronger candidates, at a time when the divide was a fraction of what it is now, when the dysfunction was nowhere near as bad and Schultz is better known and a less flawed candidate. He's an underdog, but it's more than possible.
@IonaItalia Spend time with them, just enjoying life.
@RebeccazWriting @GeoCommonSense @DavidJollyFL @soledadobrien If you look at the full array of issues, Eisenhower is way off to the right on today's political spectrum.
@RebeccazWriting @GeoCommonSense @DavidJollyFL @soledadobrien Yes, harm a company that pays it's employees well over industry standard because someone who doesn't even work there anymore did something you don't like. Classy.
@crewdog58 @Pietro5266 @HowardSchultz If that's true, it's marginal, and he's neither of them.
@crewdog58 @Pietro5266 @HowardSchultz Liberals, progressives and the left vs far left disagree. Use left vs far left if you'd like. The spectrum doesn't skip from far left to centrist. Most of the left are just regular liberals.
@crewdog58 @Pietro5266 @HowardSchultz Nobody said he was a progressive. He's a liberal.
@crewdog58 @Pietro5266 @HowardSchultz He is part of the liberal base of his party.
@drakegalaxy Same.
@midclassmoderat Different Rasmussen. He left years ago, before it went off the rails, and has his own thing now.
@crewdog58 @Pietro5266 @HowardSchultz Biden on the issues. https://t.co/IlFGN5JSnA
@judgetrainer Eisenhower only had military experience, and he was an excellent president, and lots of good politicians were good that came from business, while lots of bad politicians came from government.		It's just not something that is predictive.
@graymattersrdio Intentions are dodgy - we can't ever really know what they are. I try to focus on substance.
@PMcConnellLaw Trump &amp; the GOP don't magically change what words mean, and his stances so far disagree with you.
Winning isn't the only reason to run, but Hewitt is right, The opening in the political landscape that Perot pushed through in 1992 is at least twice as wide today, and Schultz seems like a stronger candidate to me. https://t.co/JCPYpRVGFz
@phalanx @JonVespasian @katyjohnson30 Again, one reason of a great many.
@GeoCommonSense @DavidJollyFL @soledadobrien "These Dems are in fact equal to Eisenhower Republicans in their views."		Not even remotely true.
@graymattersrdio Like what I see so far, but don't know enough to know whether I support them yet, and obviously that could change in the future if other centrists run.
@PMcConnellLaw It stopped being fun when you started using rheotical gymnastics, like that nonsense three tweets up.
@PMcConnellLaw You either didn't read it, or you're stooping to lying now.		"whose beliefs fall between those of liberals and conservatives"		Kemp, Romney and Reagan are all conservatives. By definition, they can't be centrists.
@GeoCommonSense @DavidJollyFL @soledadobrien You can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig. Voting for corrupt, out of touch politicians means you support that agenda more than any hot air you could ever emit - actions speak louder than words.
@PMcConnellLaw And? Nobody here has said anything contrary to that, nor does it conflict with or prove anything either of us has said here.
@crewdog58 @Pietro5266 @HowardSchultz And? Nobody said he did.
@PMcConnellLaw It's not about agreeing or disagreeing. That's the reality of today's political spectrum, and what you just said is true, but doesn't have anything to do with what we're talking about.
@crewdog58 @Pietro5266 @HowardSchultz I'm actually deep in skepticland, which is why I see the spoiler nonsense for what it is.
@PMcConnellLaw I literally just said that you don't get to redefine words - I don't get one either.		Yes, that's literally what dictionaries are. https://t.co/9QP29V0Ouk
@PMcConnellLaw If you expand the center that far right, you'd have to expand it an equal amount to the right, and that would pull in most of the Democratic Party, and the fantasy that ~75% of the country is centrist. That's pure pipe dream.
@crewdog58 @Pietro5266 @HowardSchultz I didn't say anything about stomaching.
@crewdog58 @Pietro5266 @HowardSchultz Biden is a liberal Democrat. Not being left wing doesn't make you a centrist.
@PMcConnellLaw That's not what centrist means. You don't get to redefine words to fit your agenda, any more than anyone else does.
@PMcConnellLaw Reality / polling data disagrees, and again - we're not talking about my personal opinions here. You just keep trying to change the subject to that for some bizarre reason. Note that I'm not pretending this has anything to do with you personally - yet you keep stooping to that.
@crewdog58 @Pietro5266 @HowardSchultz Long shot, but stranger things have happened - recently... Trump, and there is no such thing as a spoiler. That's just people blaiming their failures on others.
@GeoCommonSense @DavidJollyFL @soledadobrien If you want two sane parties, then a centrist independent campaign is the fastest way to get there.
@crewdog58 @Pietro5266 @HowardSchultz What's selfish is pretending that a candidate running to represent views neither major parties represent anymore is selfish. They abandoned the center - the natural effect of that is more and more centrist independents running for office.
@PiccolaDonnina @DavidJollyFL @soledadobrien Moot. Doesn't have to. Doesn't have not to.
@DrMindermast I'm not. The 'spoiler' nonsense is just people trying to shift blame for their own failures.
@crewdog58 @Pietro5266 @HowardSchultz Nobody who has a chance of winning the Dem nomination represents centrists. That's Dems' own fault - not someone who runs to actually represent us.
@Martin75548654 The current state of it - yes.		The nature of it - I can't agree. It hasn't always been this bad.

@annaleclaire @schultz2020fans Sure does: @HowardSchultz 		He's had one for a while, but he sent his first three tweets tonight.
@PMcConnellLaw It's already big. Much bigger than the Dems or GOP are. As you aptly pointed out, he should balance the ticket with someone center-right.
@phalanx @JonVespasian @katyjohnson30 That's certainly one reason, of a great many.
@PMcConnellLaw Don't put words into my mouth.		Personality doesn't have anything to do with where you are on the spectrum, and I didn't say anything about my personal views.		Being reasonable doesn't make you anything. There are reasonable people all over the spectrum. We don't have a monopoly.
@JonVespasian @phalanx @katyjohnson30 Could have the election go to the House. That would be interesting.
@phalanx @JonVespasian @katyjohnson30 Polling and voting patterns prove that, but the question is how many of them he could convince to vote for him.
@PMcConnellLaw I'm not familiar with Kemp's views, but Reagan and Kasich are well to the right of the center-left, which is where Schultz has seemed to be in the past, and continues to seem to be with what he's said so far.
@JohnBoardCT @RENTonFOX They better not screw that up. I love that movie.
@Pietro5266 @HowardSchultz From what I'm seeing, the bigger one is just different standards. Dems are losing my vote or support - they never had it.
@PKHarrington Maybe not, but if his platform matches what he said, he does represent our views. Dems don't. Trump doesn't.
@katyjohnson30 @JonVespasian Voters decide elections. You can't split a vote. That's just politicians trying to blame their failures on other people.
@JonVespasian Until that interview, that was a big question. He's been a moderate Dem for some time.
@JonVespasian You know... he just might! haha
@JonVespasian https://t.co/mZV2SAsANg
@PoliticsSoForth @midclassmoderat It's not perfect, but look at reforms in the Dems' HR1 legislation. Lots of steps in the right direction in there.
@JonVespasian Luckily, independents don't have to go through a primary. Instead, they need to put together a ground game in 50 states to collect the signatures to get on the ballot.
@LarrySabato @60Minutes It was an interview, not a platform unveiling.
@ApolloTheXIII Good lord... that's even dumber than horseshoe "theory".
@AfterParty_USA @HowardSchultz @uniteamerica @representus @ronfournier amen
@JohnBoardCT @HowardSchultz @lisamurkowski @JohnKasich George W. Bush had tons of experience, and I'm looking for a centrist.		Reality is, we never know how well someone will be able to handle the office until they're there.
@LDenoncourt I don't have a party.
@PoliticsSoForth @midclassmoderat We can eat away at the edges of CU, and CU just covers part of corruption - there are other areas that state and federal law could make improvements in.
@ApolloTheXIII There isn't a centrist movement, but if one comes  along, it would obviously be miles from communists, or it wouldn't be centrist.
@PKHarrington Can't unite with a party that has no interest in representing us.
@RonBrownstein I'd love to have someone on the ballot that I can actually support on the ballot on the presidential line for once, if he is the centrist he says he is.
@JohnBoardCT @HowardSchultz @lisamurkowski That'd be a hell of a ticket.
There it is. Stances he's taken so far are in line with this. https://t.co/mZV2SAsANg
@HowardSchultz Pull in a right leaning centrist to balance out your ticket - like Larry Hogan, Charlie Baker or Lisa Murkowski, and that would be a fantastic ticket.		Be sure to build your campaign in a way that lays a foundation for those who come after this cycle as well.

@Pietro5266 @HowardSchultz Same here. A serious centrist independent campaign is the best thing that could happen for centrists in this country.
@Pietro5266 @PiccolaDonnina @HowardSchultz It's fluff because it's all people just people inflating guesswork.
@Pietro5266 @HowardSchultz You brought that up, not me.		That's literally the case, no matter how you try to spin it.		Voting for corrupt, out of touch politicians is worse than not voting, for me. Luckily, nobody's opinion has any effect on anyone else's vote.
@Dnikdnayppah @midclassmoderat @middletyn Same here. I just see how running for president could be the most powerful way to do that.
@Pietro5266 @HowardSchultz No, that's just your spin on it. What I said is exactly as true as what you said, and the voters decide who wins, same as I've been saying.
@Pietro5266 @PiccolaDonnina @HowardSchultz It obviously is. Nobody is arguing the contrary.
@Pietro5266 @HowardSchultz You've got that right, same as every other voter and candidate has the same right to choose for themselves.
@Dnikdnayppah @midclassmoderat @middletyn Excellent - don't vote for him then, same as I'd never vote for anyone that could win either major party nomination. That's democracy.		The rest is neither here, nor there.
@Pietro5266 @PiccolaDonnina @HowardSchultz Eisenhower did a pretty great job of that. IN reality, it's just not something we can know about anyone at all until they're in the job. That's not any more the case about Schultz than anyone else.		This is just fluff.
@Pietro5266 @HowardSchultz No - they LITERALLY aren't, no matter which way you try to spin it.		It's not your gamble. The only gamble we make in the presidential race is your choice of who to vote for, and otherwise support. The Dem &amp; Trump have no chance of getting mine. Schultz might.
@PiccolaDonnina @Pietro5266 @HowardSchultz He's a lot more conservative on the issues than a lot of people think he is. That'll become clear if he ends up running as an indie.
@Pietro5266 @HowardSchultz In your scenario, 70% voted against the Democrat, and 70% voted against Schultz. That's outlandish cherry picking.
@Pietro5266 @HowardSchultz We already have the freedom to vote for whomever we want. I just hope someone I can actually vote for is on the ballot this time, that I think would be a good president. Neither major party will do that this cycle - maybe Schultz is. Too early to tell.
@Dnikdnayppah @midclassmoderat @middletyn Running for president is probably the best way he could do that, and spoilers aren't real. That's just people blaming their failures on others.
@PiccolaDonnina @Pietro5266 @HowardSchultz Kasich can't run as a centrist. He's a conservative.
@judgetrainer A lot of good politicians come from the business world - Mark Warner, for instance. I don't really care about the personal stuff - it's substance that matters.
@PiccolaDonnina @Pietro5266 @HowardSchultz Straw man from this Taniel person.
@Pietro5266 @HowardSchultz That's not what elections are, and every campaign is a gamble.
@midclassmoderat @middletyn No such thing as a spoiler in the first place. Just candidates that do or don't earn enough votes to win or lose.		Nothing about that is mutually exclusive, and if he's a terrible candidate that would harm centrists, he wont get very far regardless.
@Pietro5266 @HowardSchultz No you're not, because it's not a voting block until it votes. You keep trying to pretend that votes are owned before they are cast - they aren't.
@Pietro5266 @PiccolaDonnina @HowardSchultz Obama, JFK, Reagan, Sanders, etc etc
@Pietro5266 @HowardSchultz Incorrect. I responded directly to your points. You merely disagree, and are shifting the blame for a potential scenario away from the actual reality of how elections work.		If Dems lose, it's THEIR fault, not anyone else's.
@Pietro5266 @HowardSchultz It's not an experiment in the first place.
#Poll: Most Americans Say New Dem Majority Should Publicize #Trump Tax Returns // this is a no-brainer - some Dems appear to want to draw this out and use it as a political football, but they have the power to do it at any time now - enough games: DO IT https://t.co/PiWxC6FYno
@Pietro5266 @HowardSchultz You can't split a vote. Votes are owned by voters, and voters alone until they are cast. If candidates don't earn enough to win, that's THEIR fault, not the fault of other candidates.
@Pietro5266 @HowardSchultz You can't split a vote.
@midclassmoderat @middletyn If I thought he might drop out just because he's losing, I wouldn't support him. You shouldn't get into a race unless you'll go all the way.
@middletyn Doesn't give Trump anything. Voters decide elections.
@Pietro5266 @HowardSchultz If you don't support him, then more power to you. Centrists have the same right to have someone who actually represents them on the ballot as the left and right do.
@Pietro5266 @HowardSchultz Perot won almost 20% of the vote, at a time when the gap between the major parties was tiny in comparison to now, dysfunction was significantly less bad and Perot was a decidedly flawed candidate.
@Pietro5266 @HowardSchultz It objectively isn't binary, otherwise we wouldn't have Angus King, tens of millions of independent voters and non-major parties.
@Pietro5266 @HowardSchultz As I said yesterday, if Democrats want to know who is to 'blame' for moderates leaving their party and running as independents, they should look in the mirror:		https://t.co/tWGv4Q32Ds
@Pietro5266 @HowardSchultz You're looking at it backward. Candidates don't own votes until they're cast for them, so they can't lose them - they just didn't earn them, and if that happens, that's their fault, not the fault of the candidate that did earn them.
That's the last line from the interview - I'll go through it more thoroughly when I can find it online. Hopefully they'll release even more than made it into the broadcast.
"Like most people, I've become bored of President Trump and his tweets."
"Would you release your tax returns?"		"100%"
"Over 40% of the electorate is either an registered independent... or looking for a better choice."		Preach.
He's done the work to figure out how to get on the ballot in all 50 states.
Good comment about a leader not being about being the smartest person in the room about everything, and picking the right people - nice divergence from Trump.
Getting some good quick stances on issues. I don't type fast enough... will have to break this down in a blog post. Making good points, though.
Excellent. The @HowardSchultz interview just started on 60 Minutes - just said he'd "run as a centrist independent". https://t.co/oxyD2TkP32
@HowardSchultz https://t.co/oxyD2TkP32
@willfleet Not zero, and voters decide elections.
Still a long way from knowing enough to know if I'd support his campaign (and FYI - Uniters doesn't do endorsements), but hopefully we'll get some more substance soon.
It's telling that so many blind partisans are saying they'd boycott Starbucks if Howard Schultz runs for president in a way they don't like, even though he doesn't work there and owns only 3% of its stock - AKA harm a company that treats its employees well, to own the indies.
@HowardSchultz Been following you for a little while, and have been a fan since I read about your business practices some years ago. Looking forward to seeing the substance of your campaign, and hoping you run the big tent centrist campaign so many of us are hoping for.
Everyone caught up in the Trump investigations https://t.co/DHY4NkxA3b https://t.co/6KCPDNJl3S
@MaxBoot Agree, except not even close to the first one he can't rationalize away. Certainly, one of the hardest to try, though.
As 2020 looms, the Koch network says it wants to pivot to bipartisanship // I only  might believe it after I've seen it consistently for several years, and no helping toward hard core partisan and/or right wing Republicans https://t.co/47Vb9Eueu2
@pgroshon That doesn't conflict with anything I said either. All of the campaigns knew the rules going into it.
@pgroshon Nothing you just said even conflicts with what I said.		Candidates competing for voters is the very foundation of democracy.
@mcwbr Claire McCaskill and Mark Warner are nowhere near Ronald Reagan - well to the left of him.
@mcwbr You're objectively wrong on the rest of that nonsense, but don't let that pesky "reality" thing get in the way of you and your conspiracy theories.
@mcwbr She is left wing, and her organization is a dark money group. It's just accurate - I'm not attacking her. Quite the opposite, in fact - I was pointing out an area of agreement with someone we usually disagree with.
@pgroshon That's the Democratic Party and Clinton campaign's failure to earn those votes - not anyone else's.
@m_nwwn1 @samforus Depends on what state you're in, and where they expand to this cycle. You don't need any experience to do most political volunteering. You just need to show up. Until millions of regular people like you start doing so, we'll never be able to compete with the two major parties.
Even Nina Turner (who is the president of the left wing dark money group that Bernie Sanders started) sees the writing on the wall on how the Democratic party is trying to blame others for pushing people out of their party tent and blaming others for their failure to earn votes. https://t.co/AGiKhkaJpo

@m_nwwn1 @samforus I'm within walking distance of Kansas (in KC, MO) so I'll be helping with that, once that effort gets started. I'm pretty psyched - it's been a while since I found an effort I was gung ho enough about to do door knocking and boothing type stuff for.
@m_nwwn1 @samforus To be clear - they aren't a party. They're an organization that is trying to essentially kickstart parties. They have a brand new one in New York State, and they're working with the new one in Kansas to try to get it ballot-qualified this cycle.
@m_nwwn1 @samforus Mostly professionalism, experience and just watching them (met them once) since I first heard about them a while back.		Everyone who works there, that I've seen, knows more about political organizing than &gt;99% of the independents I've ever gotten to know.

@m_nwwn1 @AlliancePTYTN @IndieNj @IndyMN @brian_mistrot @AlliancePTY @samforus Whoops: "188" - alas, I am not an immortal, haha		Meant to say '18'. 18-odd years
@m_nwwn1 @AlliancePTYTN @IndieNj @IndyMN @brian_mistrot @AlliancePTY @samforus Pretty typical for "parties" that have no clue what they're doing. I've seen a bunch of them come and go over the last... 188-odd years. This one too, shall pass, SAM is the first one I've seen that might actually last, and actually knows what it's doing.
@m_nwwn1 @AlliancePTYTN @IndieNj @IndyMN @brian_mistrot @AlliancePTY @samforus Tip of the iceberg.		My personal favorite thing that one of the ex-Whigs found (one of many reasons they left) was one of their state chairs is an anti-vaxxer conspiracy theorist (among other outlandish stuff).

@m_nwwn1 @AlliancePTYTN @IndieNj @IndyMN @brian_mistrot @AlliancePTY @samforus If I was as unethical as some of the AP leadership, I'd twist something they said in the past into a pretzel, as they have several times with me and some others I know, and pretend they support that, but I don't think anyone is arguing for that here.
@m_nwwn1 @AlliancePTYTN @IndieNj @IndyMN @brian_mistrot @AlliancePTY @samforus More to the point - the Green Party and Ben Sasse are both miles away from that tent.
@m_nwwn1 @AlliancePTYTN @IndieNj @IndyMN @brian_mistrot @AlliancePTY @samforus Agree in general, but that pole isn't the platform. Ask rank and file members of the Democratic and Republican party for details on the party platform, and &gt;99% will have not seen it.

@m_nwwn1 @AlliancePTYTN @IndieNj @IndyMN @brian_mistrot @AlliancePTY @samforus If you were right, then - for instance - there wouldn't be a wide spectrum of voting patterns in the Senate, which does not reflect reality: https://t.co/pqPcDqFjMA
@m_nwwn1 @AlliancePTYTN @IndieNj @IndyMN @brian_mistrot @AlliancePTY @samforus That's the tent pole, then you build outward from there, and you build a big tent that welcomes those who generally agree just most of the time - no "stringent adherence" nonsense.
@m_nwwn1 @AlliancePTYTN @IndieNj @IndyMN @brian_mistrot @AlliancePTY @samforus What centrists believe is easy to find out - just look at polling. If your party doesn't represent those beliefs, then it's not a centrist party.
@m_nwwn1 @AlliancePTYTN @IndieNj @IndyMN @brian_mistrot @AlliancePTY @samforus That's a GOOD THING. Unlike one of the lies they tried to paint on me, I think that ideological zealotry is a terribly bad thing.
@m_nwwn1 @AlliancePTYTN @IndieNj @IndyMN @brian_mistrot @AlliancePTY @samforus That's great. Again - that's just being reasonable.
@m_nwwn1 @AlliancePTYTN @IndieNj @IndyMN @brian_mistrot @AlliancePTY @samforus Neither here, nor there - neither major party requires stringent adherence to their platform. Few people even pay attention to party platforms, outside of party insiders during the week or two around their conventions.
@AlliancePTYTN @m_nwwn1 @IndieNj @IndyMN @brian_mistrot @AlliancePTY @samforus ...not "several accounts" as in other Twitter accounts - "several accounts" as in 'several things you've brought up'.
@AlliancePTYTN @m_nwwn1 @IndieNj @IndyMN @brian_mistrot @AlliancePTY @samforus Merely being reasonable has nothing to do with being a centrist. There are wonderful, reasonable people all across the spectrum - pretending we have a monopoly on that is the height of egomania.		If you don't stand for what centrists believe, you're not a centrist party.
@AlliancePTYTN @m_nwwn1 @IndieNj @IndyMN @brian_mistrot @AlliancePTY @samforus You're guilty of being patently dishonest on several accounts, as is the pattern from your organization.
@m_nwwn1 @AlliancePTYTN @IndieNj @IndyMN @brian_mistrot @AlliancePTY @samforus Most importantly - this is part of a pattern from them, going back several months, and against several people I know, and have met recently. Some of them former members looking for an actual centrist party, that isn't an organizational train wreck or run by dishonest people.
@m_nwwn1 @AlliancePTYTN @IndieNj @IndyMN @brian_mistrot @AlliancePTY @samforus Its' not only not what I said, it's not what I think, I think that sort of terminology is stupid, and the fact that - as usual - they lied about what I said rather than engage honestly, is exactly what I was referring to above.
@m_nwwn1 @AlliancePTYTN @IndieNj @IndyMN @brian_mistrot @AlliancePTY @samforus Their behavior and dishonesty tell a different story.		They can't come together with a common platform, unless they didn't mean what they said in the first place. Ben Sasse and the Green Party disagree by huge margins on the vast majority of policy.
@m_nwwn1 @AlliancePTYTN @IndieNj @IndyMN @brian_mistrot @AlliancePTY @samforus ...and the Green Party isn't a liberal party. It's a fringe left wing party, so I'm not even sure what your point is there.
@m_nwwn1 @AlliancePTYTN @IndieNj @IndyMN @brian_mistrot @AlliancePTY @samforus Pointing out that contradiction doesn't amount to saying anything against representation from conservatives and liberals - some moderate conservatives and moderate liberals would obviously be important parts of a centrist party, as I've been saying consistently for over a decade.
@m_nwwn1 @AlliancePTYTN @IndieNj @IndyMN @brian_mistrot @AlliancePTY @samforus Ben Sasse is one of the most ideologically right wing politicians in Washington, and the founder of the party said that he's who represents what the party stands for, and should back him for president.

@AlliancePTYTN @m_nwwn1 @IndieNj @IndyMN @brian_mistrot @AlliancePTY @samforus ...because I neither think that, I wouldn't even use the term "true centrist", and I haven't said anything about "representation from conservatives and liberals" to begin with...		If you were respectful, you wouldn't like out of your teeth, like this.
@AlliancePTYTN @m_nwwn1 @IndieNj @IndyMN @brian_mistrot @AlliancePTY @samforus @Shot_of_Reality - ^^^ another one for your file.
@AlliancePTYTN @m_nwwn1 @IndieNj @IndyMN @brian_mistrot @AlliancePTY @samforus Like your founders, and the two major parties you're pretending to be different from - instead of engaging honestly, you refuse to engage on substance, and instead stoop to dishonesty.
@AlliancePTYTN @m_nwwn1 @IndieNj @IndyMN @brian_mistrot @AlliancePTY @samforus If you knew anything about me, you'd know I reject ideology, that I recognize that there is no centrist ideology to be pure about in the first place, and I'm all for seeking perspectives from reasonable people across the spectrum.
@AlliancePTYTN @m_nwwn1 @IndieNj @IndyMN @brian_mistrot @AlliancePTY @samforus Lying about what I've said, as you just did, is an excellent illustration of what is wrong with your party.		I have done no such thing.
@SenhorRaposa Unless the Wikipedia article on it isn't factual, it appears that there were people that both helped and fought the Nazis in it.		I'm all for bashing wingnuts like Gorka, but not sure this particular one is salient.
@SenhorRaposa What group?
@aliconig @joncoopertweets I still think they'll win the presidential, though, even without this fairy tale he's talking about coming into being.
@aliconig @joncoopertweets That process would take years, and would require the party going to war with the second most powerful faction inside its tent - AKA, it's not going to happen.		They made their bed. Their choices over many years is the cause to this effect.
@aliconig @joncoopertweets It's too late. They have been steadily moving away from the center for a decade. There is nothing they can do now to erase that. If they want it by next election, they'd have to radically expand the tent and push out people like AOC who are for primarying liberals and moderates.

@lbrentallison73 Ooh... Interesting question :)		I know that was the case with both Clinton and Trump in the general, but I don't remember seeing that in the spare primary exit polling (it was also over two years ago). Couldn't find something like that quickly.
This is part of Sanders' pattern - not a divergence. Sanders also went right back to taking PAC money after dropping out of the presidential race, and launched a dark money group - his actions indicate he never believed his own anti-corruption rhetoric. https://t.co/OT2r4C7aYu
@michaellubic @SykesCharlie I know that's what they call it. It's just not how democracy works. If a party drives former members out, who run as independents, and voters choose to vote with the latter - that's not anyone's fault but the party, for driving voters away.

@IndieNj @IndyMN @AlliancePTYTN @brian_mistrot @AlliancePTY @samforus Boy did you join the wrong party, then.
@jetsjets @SykesCharlie @MelissaJPeltier @HowardSchultz If the Democratic Party gave a shit about America, it wouldn't have devolved into the sorry state it's in now, where a left wing independent is a contender for their presidential nomination, and moderates are being driven from the party.
@IndieNj @IndyMN @AlliancePTYTN @brian_mistrot @AlliancePTY @samforus SAM - smartly - wont touch your train wreck with a ten foot pole. They're just too nice to say that to you.
@IndieNj @IndyMN @AlliancePTYTN @brian_mistrot @AlliancePTY @samforus A party ran by a supporter of Ben Sasse, who I have on tape saying Sasse is the candidate that represents what his party stands for, and a Green Party officer isn't a centrist party. It's another in a long line of train wrecks.
@aliconig @Marti_in_DE Colorado governor John Hickenlooper is also rumored to be considering a run - he's a moderate Dem, and could go either way.
@aliconig @Marti_in_DE Larry Hogan is a moderate Republican that might run, though he's currently rumored to be running against Trump in the GOP primary. He's the second most popular governor in the country - in a blue state - and would be an ideal VP for Schultz.
@aliconig @Marti_in_DE I used to do that too. One wonders how many millions of people are only Dems / GOP on paper, because of closed primaries.
@IndyMN @AlliancePTYTN @brian_mistrot @AlliancePTY Big mistake. You should be working with @samforus - not that mess.

@Marti_in_DE @aliconig That's not what we're talking about here, but the GOP made the same sort of excuses in past elections, and the same thing holds true - they failed, and they tried to blame their failure on others.

@JairusBurdick @LibertyEricRI @BennSteil @CHSommers I get that. As I said - subsidizing college education is just not accurately labeled as socialist, and they'd go much much farther.
@JairusBurdick @LibertyEricRI @BennSteil @CHSommers Public education isn't socialism. Most people want a good public education system - socialists don't have a monopoly on that idea, and would go a lot farther.

@grrillzilla Not sure about more or less money in general, but definitely exponentially more money that is being spent on buying influence in politics.
@michaellubic @SykesCharlie This is all cause and effect in a democracy - independent centrist candidates are a natural result of the two major parties abandoning the center.
@michaellubic @SykesCharlie What do primaries have to do with anything? Independents don't have presidential primaries.		And spoilers don't exist. If the Dem loses, it's their fault for not earning enough votes to win, not someone else's for offering an alternative, since that party stopped representing us.
@RolandBlasini @frequentbuyer1 @theabstoddard Polls actually showed the race within the margin of error. It was the PUNDITS that misread the data and got it wrong.
@will_buckskin Amen.
@aliconig @Marti_in_DE They'd for sure take both, but that's also Dems trying to blame others for their failure as a party - the whole reason someone who has been a moderate Democrat might run as an independent is because the Democratic Party has abandoned the center.

@Marti_in_DE True, and the sooner we start trying, the sooner we'll eventually start building something that has a chance someday.
@1999Liberal Even under a perfect system, the views they stand on are held by a very small portion of the population.
@1999Liberal I agree in principle that revolving around 2 is bad, but to make it not work that way, more parties need to do the hard work of building an opposition, and earn the support to compete.
@1999Liberal That's not how representative democracy works. Libertarians &amp; greens represent a tiny percentage of the population, so it wouldn't make any sense to give them as many seats as Dems, GOP or a new centrist party.		The hard truth is it's up to us to organize and represent ourselves.
@weisacre I'm flattered by your conspiracy theories, but we haven't launched yet, so we haven't been funded by anyone.
@ttodhunter Reading comprehension appears not to be your strong suit... I literally just said I don't have to - and I'm not choosing to put it on yours - it's decided by an algorithm... and yes... you do follow us - at least as of ~30 seconds ago when I took the screenshot. https://t.co/rU8w9QpUYB
@1999Liberal There already are more parties than that - there are choices. It's just that they're bad ones, and/or horribly organized. The system does favor it, and that should change, but even most multi-party parliamentary systems revolve around two bigger parties.

@dluippold @JeSuisAS @phxtobama16 I use public statements, look at websites that track that like https://t.co/EckCu8B5jb, and sites that track and map voting records, like https://t.co/m1kxQ0wGho and https://t.co/i0486pMHoL.
@dluippold @JeSuisAS @phxtobama16 Centrist is just a range on a spectrum. A centrist here wouldn't be in most other countries, and vice versa.
@dluippold @JeSuisAS @phxtobama16 I try to be specific in my terminology - centrism is more of a misnomer, as it gives some people the impression that there is an ideology, which isn't possible, given that what equates to center, left, right, far left/right, etc in each country is different.
@mjdawidowicz Yes... that's how cause and effect works.
@ttodhunter I don't have to. If you don't want to see my tweets, then don't follow us.
@mjdawidowicz ...and most people who run for president have no realistic path to winning, and winning isn't the only reason to run - nor does that mean it's a vanity campaign.
@mjdawidowicz Incorrect. It's not about blame. It's about cause and effect. Push moderates out, and you're going to get moderates running as independents. Move farther left, and you're going to more far left people trying to run in your tent.
@Polit_eurOpines @DogPhoenixWP The whole country has not moved very much in just a few years.
@mjdawidowicz As I think I clearly stated in the tweet you RT'd - it's an if/then.		Whether it's good or bad is subjective, of course, but their own actions are the cause of these things.
@DogPhoenixWP @Polit_eurOpines They're not exact, I average three sites that do this mapping and his voting record has a definite leftward lean.

@Polit_eurOpines @DogPhoenixWP Incorrect on both.		Biden on the issues: https://t.co/Hc6ULLyLoN https://t.co/6BMNsVfhU2
@mjdawidowicz We're saying the same thing, using different words.
@dluippold @JeSuisAS @phxtobama16 I don't have a centrist test. I can read dictionaries, see how people vote and what stances they take, and look at how experts have shown where those votes and stances place them on the political spectrum.
@DogPhoenixWP @Polit_eurOpines Neither of them are centrists. Mark Warner and Claire McCaskill are two examples of center-left moderates. Biden and Beto are on the left, just not far left, left wing or however you want to word it.
@dluippold @JeSuisAS @phxtobama16 And? The political spectrum isn't a binary - it's a spectrum. A lot of liberals voted that way. People who are 100% zealots with an ideology are exceedingly rare.
@mjdawidowicz Hence "they're just too blind to see it" in the next tweet.
@DogPhoenixWP @Polit_eurOpines Not for president. There are still a some center-left Dems left in Congress, but they're a dying breed, have almost no power in the party and even if what you had said were true, that doesn't even conflict with what I said.

@JeSuisAS @dluippold @phxtobama16 Point being? The spectrum isn't just radicals and centrists. Most on the left and right are just regular conservatives and liberals - the latter being what Clinton and Obama are.

The GOP is rife with the same dynamic - blaming problems they created for themselves on others, rather than listening, learning and adapting.		Blaming their problems on centrists and/or independents just illustrates and magnifies the problem - they're just too blind to see it.
If Democrats want to know why a left wing candidate like Bernie Sanders, who isn't even really a Democrat, is a contender for their nomination, and a center-left moderate is considering running for president as an independent - the answer is staring back at them in the mirror.
@NYCNavid This is actually more part of his pattern, than a divergence. He also went right back to taking PAC money after dropping out of the presidential race, and started a dark money group. His actions indicate he never believed his own anti-corruption rhetoric.
@jessesingal WTF
@rlongman1 @HowardSchultz You lost me. What does this have to do with what I said?
@half_witt @HowardSchultz @realDonaldTrump @DrJillStein If you agree with what he said, then all of the dishonest bullshit you've been spewing makes even less sense than it already has seemed to.
@half_witt @HowardSchultz @realDonaldTrump @DrJillStein Now you're stooping to blatant lying.		I said nothing at all remotely like that, nor do I think it.		You're just a dishonest hack, and you should be ashamed of yourself for being so dishonest.
@half_witt @HowardSchultz @realDonaldTrump @DrJillStein So what? And again - there is no such thing as a spoiler.		The rest is neither here nor there... hell... most of what you said is neither here, nor there.
@26327DeeDee @HowardSchultz Yes - people who ignore what is actually being talked about, and selfishly commandeer a conversation about something else to personally attack someone who made a good point about something else.
@rlongman1 @HowardSchultz Every party gets wrapped up with it's presidential candidate's campaign. That's just the nature of politics - people pay more attention to races at the top of the ticket. Can't force people to get involved down-ballot.
@half_witt @HowardSchultz @realDonaldTrump @DrJillStein We're not even talking about advocacy here. We live in a representative democracy, and there is nothing wrong with Schultz' valid criticisms of Trump.
@half_witt @HowardSchultz @realDonaldTrump @DrJillStein And? That's just something you pulled out of your ass to change the subject, that doesn't even conflict with anything either of us is saying.
@half_witt @HowardSchultz @realDonaldTrump @DrJillStein C - That's neither the point you made, nor is it true.		You can't pull votes from someone, because only voters own votes, and only they get to decide who earned them. Bush failed to earn enough votes to win. That's HIS fault, not Perot's for making his case, and earning votes.
@half_witt @HowardSchultz @realDonaldTrump @DrJillStein B - Yet another attempt to change the subject - I didn't say anything about pure democracy, or the electoral college.		If you have any ethics, somewhere inside yourself, perhaps you might dust it off and use it, or just take your trolling somewhere else.
@half_witt @HowardSchultz @realDonaldTrump @DrJillStein A - Now you're going even farther into dishonest red herring territory, with that nonsense about suppressing votes. Nobody has said anything even tangentially related to that - you're just flailing around, and stooping lower and lower.
@SykesCharlie @benjaminwittes Charlie... Charlie... Charlie... you just don't grok the magic that is Baby Cannon.
@26327DeeDee @HowardSchultz Some do. Some don't. Again - you're making this personal, when it was about the good point he made.		This makes Schultz look better, not worse, if people who argue this way have a problem with him.
@half_witt @HowardSchultz @realDonaldTrump @DrJillStein C - Perot earned votes. That's how democracy works. If the candidate you like doesn't earn enough votes to win, that's THEIR fault, not the fault of other candidates for earning votes from other voters.
@half_witt @HowardSchultz @realDonaldTrump @DrJillStein A - Objectively false. It doesn't matter who you are. You used a bigoted argument, whether you want to admit it or not, and as a red herring.		B - That's not how democracy works.
@26327DeeDee @HowardSchultz He probably is, and as someone who liked what he said here, I shard it - and boy did you jump the shark correlating this and Trump.
@rlongman1 @HowardSchultz Also, running for president is really the only way to build a new party so quickly - a single person can't fund a party, thankfully, given donation limits, but a party could piggyback on a Schultz campaign, like they do every presidential campaign affiliated with a party.
@rlongman1 @HowardSchultz Except that wouldn't be good for the country, and he's center-left, so he's obviously not going to be interested in doing that in the first place. Let the GOP burn itself to the ground, and let's build something better, without that dead weight.
@26327DeeDee @HowardSchultz I care mostly about what someone stands for, and certainly see no evidence that he doesn't have a working knowledge of the civics, but this isn't even about Schultz - he made a good point.
@half_witt @HowardSchultz @realDonaldTrump @DrJillStein Do you have something in response to what I said, or just another dishonest attempt to change the subject?
@graynorton PS - See you at the Illuminati meeting later.
@half_witt @HowardSchultz @realDonaldTrump And yet, instead of making that - also inherently flawed, given that you can't split a vote - statement, you dismissed a good point someone made by using a bigoted red herring.
@half_witt @HowardSchultz So you think Donald Trump is qualified to be president &amp; revenge politics isn't rampant and harmful, or are you so dishonest that you'd ignore someone making a good point merely because they were successful and you're bigoted toward people over a certain age, who have pale skin?

#Thread w/ highlights of some of the more noteworthy parts of the Roger #StoneIndictment (ft. the nerdfamous baby cannon of @lawfareblog EIC @benjaminwittes - I recommend following both) - incl. when Stone told 'Person 2' to "prepare to die" &amp; said he'd *take his dog* (seriously) https://t.co/YRJJczPhPF
I have yet to come across someone worth taking at all seriously who uses terms like "libtard" or "conservaturd" in any way other than poking fun at clowns that talk like that.

@LisaDTRice @womenalsoknow @POCalsoknow @jackiesalit Added the first two to the rolodex I've been collecting for people with particular expertise in certain areas.
@WebGraves Pick one or more of these orgs, and do your part - volunteer and/or donate. If your state isn't already on the list of states they've gotten their bill through, maybe they could use the help. Also would recommend @samforus
Amen to that. The CRFB, @MayaMacGuineas &amp; Co are a rare candle in the darkness of fiscal issues. https://t.co/Ii0WsbRqMH
@WebGraves Also follow them here: @NatlPopularVote
@WebGraves I believe a full replacement would require a constitutional amendment, and I'm not sure - off the top of my head - if they're working on that as well, or not. Check their site out for an explainer:		https://t.co/tH6piNeLoL
@WebGraves In essence, they've found a legal loophole that would replace the electoral college, and it's already passed in... if I'm reading this correctly... 11 states and the district of Columbia. If it passes in a bunch more, it'll effectively upend the eletoral college.
@WebGraves One of the shows on the list I've already sketched rough ideas for is one focused on the electoral college - ideally with someone(s) from the 'National Popular Vote' organization.
@WebGraves The old Chinese curse of "I hope you live in interesting times." has overtaken our age, unfortunately. Hopefully not for too much longer.
@AlanWessman @nealjsimon Preaching to the choir, my friend - and great question.
@PhilWalsh603 @nealjsimon I've got the next three weeks plotted out - what's your schedule look like the 3rd week of February, @nealjsimon? :)
@WebGraves It would have to be a slow news month to get into "small ball" stuff like getting rid of the penny (I'm totally with you on that, though - it's a no-brainer, really), but FPTP - we're *definitely* going to have episodes on electoral reform.
@TWforthepeople Personally, the area where technology, science &amp; politics overlap is a personal interest of mine, so I do hope to cover that. This is the sort of thing that we'd probably wait until an issue related to it becomes a big story, then we'd ask around for experts to come on the show.
@TWforthepeople I have seen people look into it (think tankers and policy wonk bloggers, mostly), but that's much more tricky than you may think. Since so many other industries use automation, it would be very hard to legally justify stopping just one, while allowing so many others to do so.
@nealjsimon I'd love to chat with you about that in an episode, because I don't think that cohesion is as good a thing as it may seem. There are genuine, substantive disagreements among centrists, and I believe that to be a strength, not a weakness.
@LisaDTRice @womenalsoknow @POCalsoknow @jackiesalit I'm sure her org will come up in conversations with others, and hopefully we can positively peer pressure them, No Labels and Unite America (all three are dark money groups) to do the right thing and drop the 501c4 status.
@LisaDTRice @womenalsoknow @POCalsoknow @jackiesalit If she wasn't affiliated with one, she'd be not only someone we would have on, she'd definitely be in the top 25 people we'd want to do a one on one episode with.
@LisaDTRice @womenalsoknow @POCalsoknow @jackiesalit Not familiar with the other two, but can't do Salit. One of our rules is we won't have anyone on the show, blog or any projects we do, that has worked with a dark money group in the last five years (her org is a dark money group).
@LisaDTRice @manders8589 @LizSzabo I don't know her in particular, but when looking for guests, @KaiserFamFound would naturally be one of the first places I'd go looking for guests, along with other think tanks that aren't deeply partisan, like @BPC_Bipartisan, @RANDCorporation, @BrookingsInst, @BudgetHawks, etc
@melonpost I'm not sure I've heard 'lassiez-faire social policy' before. What do you mean by that?
@Martin75548654 Definitely will discuss all things related to centrist independent candidates.

@NancyYatesSC @brian_mistrot @frequentbuyer1 @wrthomasson @RouzySC @AlliancePTY @AlliancePTYSC @Kasich4Indiana @jkempcpa @Chrisvance123 @cslick803 @JohnKasich Very much agree, but if he runs against Trump in the GOP primary, winning isn't the only reason to run. He could do good by taking a bite out Trump.
@Centrist_Mvmnt I hope we can live up to that. There are others with similarly high standards, like @IssueOneReform, @OpenSecretsDC &amp; @DarkMoneyWatch / @MapLight - I hope to have them all on at some point, and make a point to do a show focused on anti-corruption every 2-3 months.
@manders8589 Great idea. We should be able to get a think tanker on at some point, who specializes in that.
@sambeaux64 @samforus I see you're in NY state - they happen to have just started a new party there. Check them out and if you like what you see - do your part :)
@samwilkinson @TFenton54 @SenhorRaposa That's as willfully ignorant as people who believed Obama was a secret Muslim.
@sambeaux64 When I start doing interviews, one of the first several I'll try to get on will be founders of @samforus - they're working on building a centrist party.
@sambeaux64 There are scenarios where it wouldn't, but they are increasingly unlikely. It'll take a long time to build, but it'll most likely end up being necessary.
Brings up an interesting question about independent presidential candidates: regardless of their chances of winning, what are the foundational arguments they should make, and core principles they should stand for, to most effectively attract centrist and moderate voters? https://t.co/BzyLW13DUo
@NeilKirbyNY Those things have virtually nothing to do with each other.
They both were designed to fail passage, but make political statements - the only deal designed for passage passed in December, but Trump wouldn't sign it, and we've had little else but empty maneuvering since.	https://t.co/sl5FSJ9vvJ
@TFenton54 @samwilkinson @SenhorRaposa Nice fairy tale, but Tlthe Dem tent only begrudgingly accepts some center-left moderates - and less and less of those every year even. They aren't welcome to actual centrists, much left right leaning moderates.
@Fly_Agaric @SenhorRaposa There are so few moderates left in the party, they don't have the power to move the party anywhere.
@SenhorRaposa The party is increasingly unwelcome to the center left, and openly hostile to actual centrist independents. Welcoming moderate Republicans is light years from possible. All they want is our votes, then they'll ignore us, same as the last several elections.

@Randjamz "help build something better in the center"
@Randjamz "There's only Right or Left."		Not only is there a center, but also far left and right, and people who don't fit on the left-right spectrum at all, like classical liberals, communitarians and libertarians.		The political spectrum is vast and complicated.
@Randjamz Leaving a corrupt, out of touch party to join an even more corrupt, out of touch party doesn't improve anything. If you want to walk away, the right thing to do is drop both major parties, and help build something better in the center.

@ORobHarris *cough* including YOU in about a week and a half *cough*
We'll see how it plays out, but this is just step 2 of how we plan to do our part to help be a voice for centrists across the country. The community blog (Uniters Tribune - the great name you all picked in a poll a while back) will launch next, along w/ social media expansion.
If we manage to grow enough, find the help we need on the production side, &amp; raise enough money once the org launches, we'll work to expand to more episodes per week &amp; - ideally - launch a YouTube channel (in the future - a network, along with other shows we might team up with).
Panellist will range from people I just listed, all the way to the young man I just DM'd with, who's just about to enter basic training &amp; has ambitions in personal finance - grassroots level activists, amateur wonks, bloggers &amp; interesting, intelligent people we connect with.
...and people who work at orgs we support, like @samforus, @IssueOneReform, @BPC_Bipartisan, @BudgetHawks, etc. At first, we may not be able to get all that many 'big name' folk, but with your help, we'll grow and be able to get the attention of more noteworthy figures.
Interviews will primarily be (if we're able to get them on - we'll see whose arms I can twist!) interesting media figures (@JohnAvlon, @smerconish), academic experts (@LarrySabato, @JonHaidt), centrist/moderate politicians (@SenAngusKing, @clairecmc, @lisamurkowski) and...
After that, the plan is to begin alternating between interviews and panels, and instead of bouncing around from topic to topic every few minutes - never getting very deep into anything... like most political "news" shows, we'll zero in on ONE issue each episode.
Preface: The first three weeks of shows will be panels with people I've connected with online the last few years, discussing the gamut of things related to centrist/moderate &amp; independent politics, our org and taking questions from followers - like you, reading this :)
@GMaibohm Also will do a deep dive on at some point. We'll want to wait until it's related to something that's hot button in the news, but after the first few weeks of pilot &amp; intro shows, the general schtick of the show will be that we drill down on just one issue area each episode.
@GMaibohm Definitely.
@jrfunke Definitely want to discuss indie campaigns, up and down the ballot.		So... what's your schedule look like between the 4th and 7th of February? 		DM if interested :)
@FiscallyRspnsbl @BudgetHawks @ConcordC Depends on what is hot in the news at that point.
@FiscallyRspnsbl Good point.  After the first few weeks, where I'm going to have panels of people I've connected with online over the last couple years, I'm going to start alternating between panels and interviews, and getting people on from @BudgetHawks and @ConcordC is on my short list.
@mgrohman DM me with your schedule the... 4th through the 7th of February. That one isn't scheduled yet.
@mgrohman Funny you say that... you're already on my Twitter list of people I plan on inviting onto panel discussions :)		Right now, though, I'm asking for submissions of things to discuss for the first few weeks of programs.
Who has questions about centrist/moderate and independent politics, our organization or ideas for our podcast?		We'll be recording the pilot episode of our podcast tomorrow, and to kick things off we're going to do a few panel episodes, take questions &amp; feedback from you folks.
@LarrySabato @KarlRove @Center4Politics @UVABatten He made some good points on extreme polarization, but he has also been among the few dozen most responsible for that happening over the last generation, and then he went waaay off the rails in comments in defense of policies the Trump administration has pushed.

It's a fairy tale to think that someone like Biden would do it, and the only ones who might are the ones already halfway out the door in their parties - like Hickenlooper and Kasich.
@wrthomasson Independents often mistakenly discount the impact party infrastructure, organization and professional staff. It really would take a perfect storm for it to happen, but again - regardless, we should do it anyway. https://t.co/adLM8Wx120
@wrthomasson Could - yes.		Likely - no.		Either way, I hope it happens. The most likely scenario is that a centrist independent campaign will lose at least a few times before we have the national party infrastructure to win - but that foundation wont even start being built until people try.
@AlliancePartyTX @frequentbuyer1 @NancyYatesSC @brian_mistrot @wrthomasson @RouzySC @AlliancePTY @AlliancePTYSC @Kasich4Indiana @jkempcpa @Chrisvance123 @cslick803 @JohnKasich Yeah, much like left wing progressives have been paiting liberal Democrats as centrists to try and undercut them in the party, right wing conservatives have been doing the same thing with mainstream conservatives like Kasich.

@frequentbuyer1 @brian_mistrot @wrthomasson @RouzySC @AlliancePTY @AlliancePTYSC @NancyYatesSC @Kasich4Indiana @jkempcpa @Chrisvance123 @cslick803 @JohnKasich Haha - no.		I gave up on the GOP for the last time in 2006/07. Gave up on the Dems for the last time in 2008/09. Never again with either.
@frequentbuyer1 @NancyYatesSC @brian_mistrot @wrthomasson @RouzySC @AlliancePTY @AlliancePTYSC @Kasich4Indiana @jkempcpa @Chrisvance123 @cslick803 @JohnKasich I'd only vote for a ticket with Kasich on it if he's the VP, and the top of the ticket was an actual moderate on policy - Hickenlooper is a center-left moderate, for instance. Sounds like he may run as a Dem, though. We'll see.
@frequentbuyer1 @brian_mistrot @wrthomasson @RouzySC @AlliancePTY @AlliancePTYSC @NancyYatesSC @Kasich4Indiana @jkempcpa @Chrisvance123 @cslick803 @JohnKasich Kasich doesn't have a chance of winning no matter what he does. The question is which way would have more of a positive impact, and I think running in the primary against Trump would do more good.
@NancyYatesSC @frequentbuyer1 @brian_mistrot @wrthomasson @RouzySC @AlliancePTY @AlliancePTYSC @Kasich4Indiana @jkempcpa @Chrisvance123 @cslick803 @JohnKasich He has an interesting way with words that I am a fan of too, haha
@NancyYatesSC @frequentbuyer1 @brian_mistrot @wrthomasson @RouzySC @AlliancePTY @AlliancePTYSC @Kasich4Indiana @jkempcpa @Chrisvance123 @cslick803 @JohnKasich ...though if they run with a party, I wont get a chance to vote for them, living in a closed primary state.
@NancyYatesSC @frequentbuyer1 @brian_mistrot @wrthomasson @RouzySC @AlliancePTY @AlliancePTYSC @Kasich4Indiana @jkempcpa @Chrisvance123 @cslick803 @JohnKasich Nobody who has officially declared yet, but I'd vote for Hogan, Hickenlooper or Howard Schultz (among others rumored to be thinking about running), if they ran - regardless of whether they ran with a party or indie.
@RMalcolmTi @JohnAvlon @TheRickWilson No soup for you!
@frequentbuyer1 @brian_mistrot @wrthomasson @RouzySC @AlliancePTY @AlliancePTYSC @NancyYatesSC @Kasich4Indiana @jkempcpa @Chrisvance123 @cslick803 @JohnKasich He'd do more good as a foil to Trump in the GOP primary. Hogan would be better as an indie - he's actually a moderate, while Kasich just acts like one, while his policy is that of a pretty average conservative.

@DoNotTrollOnME @smith_valence @dpakman I'll make it easy for you.
@DoNotTrollOnME "twitter &amp; google track everything we do, along with the NSA and likely CIA"		Yet again, what you think you say, and what you actually type, are two very different things.		If you use Chrome, it does track, but whether that information, &amp; what info, gets to Google is your choice.
@DoNotTrollOnME The "heh" at the end was a clue... that apparently you didn't pick up on.
@DoNotTrollOnME @smith_valence @dpakman For fuck's sake. No. We don't. That's not what I said.
@DoNotTrollOnME @smith_valence @dpakman It's been annoying for a long time, and I already did. I can't read your mind. I have no idea why you're twisting my words.
@DoNotTrollOnME The CIA? Come on now.		What the NSA does isn't track everyone. That would require more computing power and storage than the entire planet has ever had, put together, multiplied several times over.		I had a friend in the NSA - there are a lot of misconceptions about that stuff.
@DoNotTrollOnME You jumped the wingnut shark.		Twitter and Google can only track what we do on Twitter, sites with Twitter widgets or Google and sites with Google Analytics, ads and the like - unless you let them track you elsewhere. They aren't magic.

@DoNotTrollOnME @smith_valence @dpakman No, that's not remotely all you did, and that's not what I said either.
@DoNotTrollOnME @smith_valence @dpakman I didn't say that until you had already displayed those traits several times.
@DoNotTrollOnME There's that victim mentality, rearing its head again. heh
@DoNotTrollOnME @smith_valence @dpakman So do I. Point being?
@TarH2O23 Yeah, I disagree with this loophole as well. I think there should be separate do not call lists for charities and political things, and people should be able to choose to block them too, if they choose.		But we can all agree that Robocalls are the worst, heh
@DoNotTrollOnME @smith_valence @dpakman Moot, given that that isn't what I said.
@smith_valence @DoNotTrollOnME @dpakman Pointing out bad behavior is not the same as name calling.
@DoNotTrollOnME @smith_valence Deal.
@DoNotTrollOnME @smith_valence @dpakman @realDonaldTrump You can read. I'm not going to do it for you. This is getting pointlessly tiresome. If this is the game you're going to play, this has long since stopped being worthwhile.
@DoNotTrollOnME I think Twitter is far too lenient, but our personal opinions on what is fair are moot. It's their platform - not ours.
@DoNotTrollOnME @smith_valence @dpakman Already did. I responded to them when you said them.
@DoNotTrollOnME @smith_valence @dpakman What are you even talking about? I'm not in any article, and I already did.
@smith_valence @DoNotTrollOnME @dpakman Part of working to unite the country is fighting divisive people like you. You're an active participant in the culture war that is tearing away at our social fabric. You're part of the problem.
@DoNotTrollOnME @smith_valence This cuts both ways.		Just like nobody should be forced to offer a job to someone they don't want to hire, nobody should be forced to work for someone, just because they offer a job to them.		If they wanted to buy a cake on a shelf, they should have to sell it to them.
@DoNotTrollOnME @smith_valence But anyone should have the right to choose not to work for someone.		The bakery was offered a job - to bake a custom cake.		This is a short term informal contract - a job offer.		/2
@DoNotTrollOnME @smith_valence You have a serious reading comprehension problem. I already clearly answered that question.		No, not all business owners.		A business shouldn't have the right to - for example - refuse people buying something off a shelf.		/1
@smith_valence @DoNotTrollOnME @dpakman I'm calling out your behavior. Again, you're playing the victim.
@smith_valence @DoNotTrollOnME @dpakman You really do have a strong projection game going. Troll on, Val.
@DoNotTrollOnME Except I did, he did, they did and so what? Twitter is under no obligation to explain themselves. They usually don't even comment at all, and that's the right call. It just feeds into these sort of ridiculous conspiracy theories.
@DavidMatheny1 We're a long way from tyranny, thankfully, but we could get there if things keep getting worse and worse for long enough.
@DoNotTrollOnME @smith_valence @dpakman @realDonaldTrump I didn't write any article.
@DoNotTrollOnME @smith_valence @dpakman @realDonaldTrump I literally pointed it out.
@DoNotTrollOnME @smith_valence @dpakman @realDonaldTrump "Is it childish &amp; victim games when a gay person complains a baker won't bake the cake for them or is that discrimination?"		I think the bigot bakers should have the right to do that, AND it's also discrimination, AND hope that doing so would cause them to go out of business.
@DoNotTrollOnME @smith_valence @dpakman @realDonaldTrump ...because you're choosing a childish mentality, and playing the victim.		"I don't think pointing out uneven application of TOS is me being eithe of those things"		Neither do I, which is why I never said that, and I'd appreciate it if you stop lying about what I said.
@smith_valence @DoNotTrollOnME @dpakman @realDonaldTrump Again - so what?
@DoNotTrollOnME @smith_valence @dpakman You really aren't. Several times now, you've twisted my words into things entirely different than what I said.
@smith_valence @DoNotTrollOnME @dpakman @realDonaldTrump Of course we do. You keep presenting people as victims, bullies and other such nonsense.		We're adults, not children.		"Yeah, victim mentality and victim culture suck."		I agree, and if you agree, why are you neck deep in it?
@DoNotTrollOnME @smith_valence And? Your opinion has nothing to do with Twitter's opinion about their own platform, same as their opinion doesn't have anything to do with the ground rules you set on your property.
@DoNotTrollOnME This is a wonderful example of willful ignorance I was talking about.		He wasn't banned for breaking that one rule, one time. He'd been breaking rules for YEARS. It was just the log that broke the camel's back.
@DoNotTrollOnME @smith_valence @dpakman Good lord. You really haven't been listening to what I've been saying...
@DoNotTrollOnME You're a grown ass man, not a machine that has been programmed. You're responsible for your own thinking.
@DoNotTrollOnME @smith_valence @dpakman @realDonaldTrump I've already said how, in several different ways, so clearly you do - you're just pretending you don't as a dodge.		I never said that last bit in the first place. This isn't cable news - straw man nonsense like that wont get you anywhere.
@smith_valence @DoNotTrollOnME @dpakman Precisely.
@smith_valence @DoNotTrollOnME @dpakman You know exactly what I think, as I've said it several times now. On top of the victim games you're playing, you're now stooping to willful ignorance.
@smith_valence @DoNotTrollOnME @dpakman Yes you are - that's just two political people in a spat with each other. So what? I've had trolls find me and troll me in real life. I've had a few death threats even.		Difference is, I'm not an infant or victim, and I don't pretend that anyone owes me a damn thing.
@DoNotTrollOnME Milo is another example of someone who flagrantly broke the rules for years. It's not even apples and oranges to compare Jones and Milo - it;s like rotten apples and an old couches.
@smith_valence @DoNotTrollOnME @nytdavidbrooks @sullydish And? I've seen centrists, libertarians and conservatives do that too.		There are petty, dishonest assholes all across the spectrum. So what? Welcome to the real world.		Again - you're playing the victim.
@DoNotTrollOnME @smith_valence You've got it backward - it was a ruling against the president blocking people. It had nothing to do with the other way around. If people break Twitter's rules, they have no right to be here.
@DoNotTrollOnME @smith_valence No. They did that because he's the president of the United States of America, and while he is president, his tweets are official government communications, so blocking journalists from seeing them isn't allowed for someone in his position.
@DoNotTrollOnME "They view the world through an oppressor/oppressed lens"		So do you two. I'm the only one here arguing against such a twisted mentality.
@DoNotTrollOnME @smith_valence @dpakman @realDonaldTrump Thankfully, your opinion has no effect on Twitter's choices, same as they have no power over rules you choose to set for your property.		And clearly you can't take it &amp; are stuck in a childish mentality, because you keep playing the victim and pretending that arguing is bullying.
@DoNotTrollOnME @smith_valence Twitter doesn't have the power to silence anyone. They just have the power to bounce people from their platform. There is no right to membership on social media websites.
@DoNotTrollOnME @smith_valence Another example of willful ignorance. I already have seen it happen to people I agree with, and every single time it's happened that I've seen - they earned it.
@DoNotTrollOnME @LouisFarrakhan Cherry picking. There are people like Alex Jones still on Twitter too.
@DoNotTrollOnME That's some outstanding willful ignorance. Even if you disagree with the rules, there is no question that he's flagrantly broken rules for years.
@smith_valence @DoNotTrollOnME @dpakman For someone decrying the progressive left, you're really acting a lot like them here... bullying... seriously? You're literally a tattle tale on a schoolyard playground here.
@smith_valence @DoNotTrollOnME @dpakman @realDonaldTrump So what? I catch flak from wingnuts, partisan hacks and ideological zealots all the damn time.		But I'm not an infant, so I don't pretend that I'm some sort of victim, or that anyone even has the power to bully me.
@smith_valence @DoNotTrollOnME @dpakman Again with the self-victimization. Arguing with someone is not at all the same thing as bullying. They are both adults. We're all adults. We are not entitled to anything from each other, or entitled to membership while breaking their ground rules.
@DoNotTrollOnME If you want to have a conversation, stay in the thread, and don't play dumb grandstanding games by arguing through RT.
@DoNotTrollOnME Trying to pretend that this amounts to tyranny is no better than some of the wingnut propaganda that the left wing trots out. It's both objectively false - that's not what the word means - and it doesn't reflect reality.
@DoNotTrollOnME That's just plain not true. Again, this is self-victimization gone amok.
@smith_valence @DoNotTrollOnME Incorrect. That's not what that word means.		It can't be tyranny unless they have 'oppressive power', which is impossible on a site like this, given that you're under no obligation to be here, and the conspiracy theories about Twitter are grossly overblown.
@DoNotTrollOnME That's only one of a great many potential outcomes, and not very likely given the minuscule percentage of the population that believe in Marxism.
@DoNotTrollOnME At every point along the vast political spectrum of belief, there are tons of people on Twitter and Facebook, who hate spew in their own unique way. If what you said were true, that would not be the case.
@smith_valence @DoNotTrollOnME True, but it's not remotely as widespread as many are pretending it is - especially this "thought crime" nonsense.
@DoNotTrollOnME Twitter, for some reason, let Alex Jones blatantly and repeatedly break rules in extreme and outlandishly nasty ways for years. They should have banned him earlier. Pretending he's an example of tyranny is a sick joke.
@DoNotTrollOnME If someone comes into your home, or your office, and behaves in a way that you don't like, you're perfectly free to boot them from your home or office. Calling that tyranny is just as childish as some of the wingnut self-victimization that the left wingers trot out.
@DoNotTrollOnME It's also not any one group that is being unfairly treated, and it's not tyranny in the first place, because social media sites are privately owned membership sites. People agree to the rules when they join, and there is no right to be here.
@DoNotTrollOnME Objectively false.		I work in online marketing. I'm keenly aware of what is going on, and while there have been a tiny number of unfair bans, at least &gt;99% have broken the rules over and over for long periods of time.
@DoNotTrollOnME Evergreen is an extreme outlier.
@DoNotTrollOnME None of that amounts to tyranny.
@DoNotTrollOnME If they had power, that'd be true. It's mostly coming from the right currently. Give Sanders &amp; Co the sort of power Trump &amp; Co have, and that'll obviously flip.

@Brant_Roun The closest thing to an establishment centrist Dem is Mark Warner, who doesn't have a real position of power in the party organization, but does hold the vice chairmanship of the Senate Democratic Caucus &amp; a couple committees. Schumer, Durbin &amp; Murray lead the Dems in the Senate.
@Brant_Roun There aren't really any of the latter left. None of the party leaders - which is generally what 'establishment' refer to - are centrists. The party leadership is dominated by liberals.

@tdpubs To his credit, Beto was one of the few that actually didn't take any PAC money, along with indies @nealjsimon and @GregOrman.
@tdpubs Separate issue, but most of them were getting little to no corporate PAC money to begin with, while they're still taking PAC money from other special interests, so it's really just window dressing for doing the same thing as before, while pretending to be anti-corruption.
@TxsDem Yes - left wing Democrats dishonestly going after liberal and moderate Democrats only helps Trump &amp; Co.
@QuakesFan84 @daveweigel There are a bunch areas where means testing would save billions. 		For example... why in the world are we giving tax write-offs to multi-milloinaires for second and third homes? Hell... if someone can afford a million dollar home, then why give them a tax break for their FIRST?
@QuakesFan84 @daveweigel I've said that several times.		That doesn't fully solve the problem, so instead of just selfishly punting the problem we're facing to the next generation - like the Boomers have to us, we need to find more money... so why not stop subsidizing rich people too?
As usual, progressives are dishonestly painting liberals as centrists, merely for not being progressives. Only two of the 6 House Dems (Cuellar &amp; Lipinski) targeted are moderates. The rest - based on public issue stances &amp; voting records - are pretty average liberal Democrats. https://t.co/dxQsG34J4t
@QuakesFan84 @daveweigel "Are poor people paying the majority of rich people's SS benefits?"		We already covered this. Everyone's FICA taxes go into the same pool.
@QuakesFan84 @daveweigel "Are rich people gonna use medicare instead of their private insurance?"		In most cases, they use Medicare, and then also buy some sort of supplemental insurance on top of that. AKA - we're subsidizing the healthcare of rich people... the people who need subsidization the least.
@QuakesFan84 @daveweigel "So if rich people pay ss taxes beyond the 90k limit, it means... theres more money for the FICA pool." - obviously - you and I agree that we should do this.
@QuakesFan84 @daveweigel Everyone's money goes into the same pot. There are no accounts where the FICA taxes you pay sits until you retire - the money goes right out to pay for current retirees' benefits.
@SISBROS1957 C'mon - you're starting to get boring. Say some more wacked out stuff, and try to be more clear so I might actually be able to tell what breed of madness you're talking about.		Got any aliens in there? Aliens are fun.		No? How about lizard people, or possibly GLBT amphibians?
@SISBROS1957 *GASP* - a nitwit?!? Whatever will I do?!?!?
@SISBROS1957 Lemme take a hit of whatever you're smoking.		I'd consider answering your question if it was possible to understand what you were even talking about, haha
@QuakesFan84 @daveweigel You're literally defending taking tax money from lower and middle class earners so you can give money to rich people.		Also - it's not withheld. Every penny in FICA taxes is spent within a month or two. FICA taxes are *taxes*, to pay for SS &amp; Medicare, not an investment.
@SISBROS1957 You're the most amusing wingnut I've interacted with in a hot minute.		You literally started with "Let me make it clear", then what followed was clear about absolutely nothing.		Please continue!
@QuakesFan84 @daveweigel Getting rid of the income limit doesn't solve the problem, and in what bizarre universe does it make sense to tax everyone to give money to rich people just because they retire, instead of keeping it and putting our social safety net closer to long term stability? Do BOTH.
@SISBROS1957 Another lie. I didn't advance any positions on that BS. You're just flailing around and making nonsense up as you go.		It is fun to watch, though. Do continue.
@QuakesFan84 @daveweigel An excellent example of willful ignorance.
@SISBROS1957 That word salad is pure Alex Jones nonsense. Not only are you just throwing wingnut BS spaghetti at the wall, but you'rs not even talking about the same conspiracy theory as you were above.
@daveweigel Objectively false. He's a moderate Democrat, who may leave the party - as many moderates have - to run as an independent.. Being interested in voting for a center-left moderate are not remotely the same as "holding out for a centrist who will take unpopular positions".

@ScottWRasmussen On top of the fact, of course, that saying things that aren't true is unethical.
@ScottWRasmussen Among a great many other reasons, speaking of the right, it's an easy target for them to dismiss and attack. She delivered a truckload of ammunition on a silver platter, and shifted attention away from the actual issue, and toward her and her statements. None of this is helpful.
@ScottWRasmussen That's not all you said, but we can move on, and I just agreed that we need to address said reality.		If you want that, as I do, then it's right to call out AOC, as she is doing that effort a great disservice with these statements.
@ScottWRasmussen @AOC @realDonaldTrump (Same with some of the excuses Trump defenders trot out when he says things that aren't true.)
@ScottWRasmussen @AOC @realDonaldTrump This sort of extreme hyperbole doesn't help w/ anything. It shifts attention away from the actual issue, and toward the dishonesty - as is happening between you and I, right here, in this thread... we're talking about her and her dishonest statements, not the actual issue.		See?
@ScottWRasmussen @AOC @realDonaldTrump More to the point:		- The world is not ending in 12 years. Saying so DISTRACTS from the very real problems that need dealing with.		- Comparing this situation to World War II is bizarre, light years from reasonable, and yet another distraction from the very real problems.
@ScottWRasmussen @AOC @realDonaldTrump You just agreed w/ me, but the "But" at the start indicated disagreement...		We very much should be addressing this directly, but you can't address something directly if you're not telling the truth about said thing.

@CIADeepTaint @dwcrawford301 @francesk @PodSaveAmerica @jonfavs @SenGillibrand You say that like it's a bad thing. Those big checks were for a VOTER REGISTRATION DRIVE that primarily set up voter registration booths in schools, low income areas and breakrooms of large low pay job sites.
@CIADeepTaint @dwcrawford301 @francesk @PodSaveAmerica @jonfavs @SenGillibrand You really are incapable of defending your position. Showing the board of a different organization - especially when we don't even have a board like that - just illustrates your lack of a coherent argument.
@CIADeepTaint @dwcrawford301 @francesk @PodSaveAmerica @jonfavs @SenGillibrand Again, you keep using red herrings to distract from your lack of any coherent response to what I've actually said here.		A large supermajority believes that people should have the option to choose between public and private insurance options. You want to strip that choice away.
@CIADeepTaint @dwcrawford301 @francesk @PodSaveAmerica @jonfavs @SenGillibrand Weak attempt to change the subject away from your kneejerk conspiracy theorizing, but E for effort, and W+ for the wingnut nonsense at the end - again, right out of Alex Jones' playbook.
@CIADeepTaint @dwcrawford301 @francesk @PodSaveAmerica @jonfavs @SenGillibrand Props for at least being honest and direct, even with the BS.		Unfortunately, your red herring only highlights the weakness of your argument. It's not about rich people, who are a small portion of the population. A large supermajority is against stripping that right away.
@CIADeepTaint @dwcrawford301 @francesk @PodSaveAmerica @jonfavs @SenGillibrand That's reality, whether you like it or not, and the vast majority of people disagree with you.
@CIADeepTaint @dwcrawford301 @francesk @PodSaveAmerica @jonfavs @SenGillibrand Also, nothing you said erases the reality you refuse to recognize.		The question is whether it would strip people of the option to choose between insurance options. M4A doesn't allow the option of choosing private insurance.
@CIADeepTaint @dwcrawford301 @francesk @PodSaveAmerica @jonfavs @SenGillibrand Not that a clown like you would care, but we're not backed by any money - don't let that get in the way of your InfoWars-esque conspiracy theories - we haven't even launched yet.

@JohnAvlon @NewDay You've been upping your game on one-liners of late 👍
@realBobW More specifically - beyond as in 'outside of'.
@realBobW AKA - If it's not late term, then people support it.
@CIADeepTaint @dwcrawford301 @francesk @PodSaveAmerica @jonfavs @SenGillibrand Probably because they understand that this is a myth. Many think 'Medicare for All' means you have the OPTION to choose between government insurance or private insurance. Polls that take the marketing out and ask specific policy options show M4A only gets about 20% support. https://t.co/wDmpnWp5K8
This reminds me of similar dishonest spin in abortion polling, where a significantly higher number of people say they are pro-life than are actually for illegalizing abortion, while a large supermajority agree that abortion should be legal beyond late term.
In reality, what people want - in polls spanning over a decade, and in polls actually asking about specific policy ideas - is the Public Option... to the tune of generally 75% to over 80%.		More: https://t.co/3i0tglD7pA https://t.co/CAHAXP80ix
The #Poll saying that 70% support Medicare for All is purposefully misleading. In reality, what polling shows is that people think that means something different, and polls show support for the actual policy, sans political marketing, at around only 20%. https://t.co/OsYcFqm4K3
@shawnsebastian It's actually about 20%.		In polls that actually ask what people think about what Medicare for All means, and other policy ideas - sans the policy marketing, what we find out is roughly 80% want the public option, not Medicare for All / single payer, which polls around 20%.

Think about this... the 10 highest paid political consulting firms had more money funnelled through them than the entire all presidential candidates spent in 2000... with a cool two hundred million to spare.		PS - It roughly doubled by 2004, &amp; Obama alone spent that much in '08.
I'd argue that those things should be tied together and moved into mandatory spending, along with - for instance - social security checks.
Regardless, the crux here is that there is something deeply wrong about there being jobs that the govt says are so essential that people can't stop doing them... but the actual people who have to do them aren't considered essential enough to require that they're paid to do so.

@PolitiCatGrump @SenhorRaposa In case it wasn't clear - I grew up in Omaha, and have spent most of my life there. I live in KC now, but still follow Omaha and Nebraska politics some.
@PolitiCatGrump @SenhorRaposa Already did. Terry was widely looked down on, even in his own party. It's a testament to the weakness of the Nebraska Dem Party that he lasted so long in a CD that has a pretty close partisan lean. Ashford lost two years later, then lost the '18 primary to someone who also lost.

@tdpubs It does have something to do with the constitution - namely presidential powers and the judicial branch's check on it. I'm not familiar enough with that to comment on it yet - he may well have the constitutional power to do this, but it's wrong regardless.
@BillmanThaddeus If this was something new or rare from her, I'd agree. It's isn't.		Hyperbole is itself a lie. Engaging in hyperbole regularly is a pattern of dishonesty. Extreme hyperbole - like this - is even worse.		Put all that together, and it's a pattern of blatant dishonesty.
@JohnAvlon I wonder if taxing short term stock ownership higher than holding equities long term would have beneficial effects.
I can't speak to the constitutionality of this, but I do think that it's just plain wrong - if someone is willing &amp; capable of doing the job, they should be not only allowed, but lauded for joining the #military, regardless of demographics	https://t.co/S7IlW2aFgv
@BillmanThaddeus Fresh - maybe, if you don't follow many people on the far left (I do - nothing I've heard her say is new to me).		Youthful - clearly, given her age.	 	Moral integrity? No, and this is one example of why.

@annalecta That is one cute puppy.
@DamonLinker And I neither think you're an idiot, nor does you playing the victim her add anything of value to... anything. You step over that line, you don't have any grounds for whining when it gets thrown back in your face.
@DamonLinker My definition comes from political science. Political spectrums don't jump from left wing to centrist, you don't have to be progressive / hard left to be on the left, and most of the people on the left are just liberals - not progressives, hard left, far left - however you want t
@DamonLinker Center-left Dems like Claire McCaskill have very little power in the party anymore. Liberals have most of the power, especially in the party apparatus, with progressives holding most of the rest.
@SykesCharlie @JVLast Like him or not (I obviously don't), but if he runs, he's a contender.
@geotom2017 @TheRickWilson Someone else beat me to it too, heh
@DamonLinker If you want to have a cordial conversation, then be cordial. You don't get to be the victim when you're the one that stepped over the line first.
@DamonLinker You mean when I was being perfectly nice to you, and then you vomited this bit of childish nonsense my way?		"Ah. So by “centrist,” you mean a moderate Republican. Good to know."
@DamonLinker Charlie Baker, Larry Hogan and Lisa Murkowski are center-right moderates. According to your fairy tale mapping, they're right wingers.
@DamonLinker In reality, both Clinton's public stances on the issues (chart on the left) and her voting record (on the right) clearly place her well to the left. Her stances and voting record are closer to Sanders and Warren than centrists.
@DamonLinker Thankfully, that's neither remotely true, nor how political spectrums work. Feel free to drink the Kook-Aid instead of recognizing the reality from actual political scientists.
@DamonLinker If you're so far out of touch with reality that you actually believe that nonsense, then you just mapped 2/3 of the American people on the right third of the American political spectrum.
@DamonLinker Obviously, because calling her a centrist is a joke. She's a liberal, not a centrist. The yarn about her being a centrist is just BS from progressives who try to pretend that anyone right of Sanders and Warren don't get to be on the left. https://t.co/BmzIVn9g2N

@theLazyAphorist Oh... I've seen it a bunch of times, haha - it's just not so bad that merely having a gun in the house is a problem.		A more accurate thing would be like how you definitely shouldn't be stoned while driving, or... go to a shooting range, or go hunting, etc.
There are no reasonable defenses to this bizarrely out-of-touch-with-reality-and-history extreme hyperbolic nonsense.		Millions of millenials are not dying in a war to keep totalitarian governments, to keep them from taking over the world and committing mass genocide.		Get real.
A ton of really dumb &amp; dishonest nonsense has been unfairly thrown at left wing freshman congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, but she substantively stepped squarely into wingnutville in saying the world is ending in 12 years because of climate change, and the World War II comparison.
@theLazyAphorist Overblown. Getting really stoned isn't going to make someone go on a murderous rampage with a gun - it's much more likely that they'd just melt into the carpet and annoy their cat, haha

@BenRodriguez413 @CharlieBakerMA @marty_walsh @TheDemocrats Perhaps most absurd of the nonsense you've spewed is this idea that being in the military is somehow a counterpoint to being socialist. There are people all over the spectrum in the military. Again, reality doesn't fit the cartoonish binary in your ideological fairy tale.
@BenRodriguez413 @CharlieBakerMA @marty_walsh @TheDemocrats Obama presented himself as more moderate in the presidential primaries, not the other way around, and Clinton's voting record years before running for president was consistently well to the left. Your spin doesn't hold up to scrutiny.
@BenRodriguez413 @CharlieBakerMA @marty_walsh @TheDemocrats I'm done playing your willfully ignorant, blindly partisan games. Take your zealotry to InfoWars, where idiocy like this belongs.
@BenRodriguez413 @CharlieBakerMA @marty_walsh @TheDemocrats Their voting records tell a different tale, no matter how much you try to spin it.		And.. what the hell is wrong with you?		I didn't say anything about marriage and race. Now you're just stooping to blatant lying.
@BenRodriguez413 @CharlieBakerMA @marty_walsh @TheDemocrats Political spectrums aren't static. They're based on the spectrum of belief among the people of a nation today - not some arbitrary map partisan hacks or ideologues try to cobble together, to prop themselves up.
@BenRodriguez413 @CharlieBakerMA @marty_walsh @TheDemocrats Good lord. Are you really as dense as you are making yourself out to be right now?		If that wasn't already baked into this, the center of those spectrums would be ten miles right of where it is.		I mean seriously.
@BenRodriguez413 @CharlieBakerMA @marty_walsh @TheDemocrats Those are both based on actual stances taken - not spin by people trying to twist reality to fit their ideological fairy tales.		Not being left wing doesn't make you a moderate. The vast majority of the left isn't progressive on everything. The spectrum isn't binary.
@BenRodriguez413 @CharlieBakerMA @marty_walsh @TheDemocrats It's an effective talking point because it's objectively true. Where the GOP goes wrong is by saying Dems are all left wing.		Dishonestly claiming that people on the left are in the center only makes it worse, and helps the GOP - you're using Orwellian strategies here too.
@BenRodriguez413 @CharlieBakerMA @marty_walsh @TheDemocrats The handful of actually moderate Dems left - like Tester - proves my point, as does the fact that no moderates are in the party leadership, and the party's base is increasingly hostile to them. That's literally my point here.
@BenRodriguez413 @CharlieBakerMA @marty_walsh @TheDemocrats None of them, and none of the Dem leadership, are anywhere close to the center.

@JillWineBanks @morgfair The right thing to do with him isn't to not have them on. It's to fact check the hell out of what hey say - during and after the interview.
@DamonLinker The divide in the Dem tent is primarily between the left and hard left - the center-left has no power in the party, and are - by far - the smallest faction.
@JonVespasian I vaguely remember my Catholic grade school organizing something when I was in middle school, but it either was optional, or I played hookie, heh
@Martin75548654 I'd vote for it if Schultz was at the top of the ticket. I'd prefer an actual center-right moderate replace Kasich - like Larry Hogan, Charlie Baker or Lisa Murkowski. I'd rather have Kasich in the GOP primary, softening Trump up for the general.
@BenRodriguez413 @CharlieBakerMA @marty_walsh @TheDemocrats The same thing is happening to the Moderates in the Dem tent - it's just the process of pushing them out started later, and they haven't been as successful yet. We aren't welcome in either major party anymore, and neither have any centrists or moderates in their leadership.
