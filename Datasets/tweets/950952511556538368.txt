.@realdonaldtrump endorsed @KevinYoder and gave him thousands of dollars too. Guess that's why Yoder is "fighting for the president's agenda" instead of ours.
Our campaign is powered by real people like you who chip in what they can because they believe in what we stand for - affordable healthcare, quality public education, and working together to make sure everyone has a shot.
Less than 2% of @KevinYoder‚Äôs money raised came from small dollar donors. He relies on big money special interests to fuel his campaign -- and they rely on him to vote their way in Washington. He represents his high dollar donors when he should be working for us.
We've officially closed the books on Q3. Thanks to YOU, we raised a record $2.79M -  more than DOUBLE our incumbent opponent! More than 96.99% of our contributions were LESS THAN $200. Our campaign is powered by people - not PACs.

Whether it's his votes to dismantle coverage or his full support of the Trump administration's agenda, Rep. Kevin Yoder has consistently shown us whose side he's on.
The Trump administration has brought a new legal challenge seeking to invalidate protections for people with pre-existing conditions and a Texas court is hearing oral arguments tomorrow in a case that could possibly gut coverage for many.
Millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions have been able to receive healthcare coverage because of protections provided in the Affordable Care Act -- but that guarantee is now under attack.

Sharice isn‚Äôt going to DC to throw fits or gain fame, Sharice wants to go to congress to address the daily struggles families face, to build bridges of opportunity, and to fight for a government that recognizes the inherent dignity each of us have." 7/7
A purpose of helping others guided by unshakeable core values.There are many great folks in the race, but Sharice Davids is too uniquely perfect, in this moment for this job, for me not to share my support. 6/7
When the nights go long &amp; lobbyist get aggressive, it won‚Äôt be boisterous campaign promises that make a Congressperson do the right thing. It will be the strength of their values. Sharice‚Äôs life has given her a unique perspective that has translated into an awesome purpose. 5/7
It wasn‚Äôt the conversation you expect when meeting someone, but Sharice isn‚Äôt just someone. Sharice sees problems as complex &amp; multifaceted. She discussed the impact tiny oversights in legislation have on people‚Äôs lives. It went from wonky policy details to raw struggles. 4/7
But one thing dominated the conversation: inherent human dignity. A concept that feels distant in these divisive times. The notion that everyone deserves respect and recognition. That every individual is worthy of the opportunity to advance. 3/7
In announcing his support, Davis said: "Sharice Davids is a brilliant woman who sees a bigger picture. Sharice &amp; I first met for coffee before she planned to run. Our 30-minute meeting glided into several hours. We discussed challenges from the neighborhood to the nation. 2/7

Our national politics are broken right now, and we need fresh ideas from leaders that represent the broad demographics of our nation. We need leaders who will make us proud again. I believe Sharice is that leader, and I am proud to cast my vote for her. 7/7
Sharice will work to fix healthcare, make our neighborhoods safer by addressing gun violence as a public health concern, bring a humane approach to immigration, and will protect equal rights for all. 6/7
Sharice has heart, communicating a vision for our country where we draw the circle wider, seeking to expand the blessings of this land to more, so that we are stronger together. 5/7
Sharice would lead through listening to the voices of those not always heard, working to strengthen our whole district, not just working on behalf of a select few. 4/7
Sharice would hit the ground running from day one. She is passionate, seeking to represent all of the Kansas 3rd, bringing life experiences that lead her to value people from every background in our community. 3/7
I'm delighted to endorse Sharice Davids for US Congress. In a field of strong candidates, Sharice rises to the top. She is smart, a lawyer with policy experience who served as a White House Fellow with the Department of Transportation. 2/7
ENDORSEMENT ANNOUNCEMENT: I'm proud to have the endorsement of Prairie Village City Councilperson Chad Herring (Ward One). Chad has proudly served his community and I value his support as we work to represent everyone in #KS03. 1/7 https://t.co/F6t5MovHEn
Sharice is kind, caring &amp; a great listener. She takes time to engage in meaningful conversations about constituent‚Äôs thoughts &amp; concerns. She is uniquely qualified w/ the experience needed &amp; the mindset necessary to do the difficult work required of her for the people in KS. 5/5
While there, Sharice managed the daily operations, acted as in house legal counsel &amp; laid the foundation for a social enterprise program. She also worked to implement federal policy and economic development. In addition, Sharice served as a White House Fellow from 2016-2017. 4/5

For generations, Kansans have believed in the power of motivated people of good will to conquer difficult challenges, ad astra per aspera. Sharice has lived that experience &amp; I'm confident she'll carry that bedrock KS ethos to DC. I hope you'll join me in supporting her. 6/6

Instead of being a leader on immigration issues and listening to the people of the Third District, Kevin Yoder took a page out of Donald Trump's playbook and responded to the rally by dismissing and demonizing hundreds of his constituents. https://t.co/RHrsWV1yVG
Congressman Yoder has simply paid lip service to us, his constituents, by saying he's against family separations while the sub-committee he chairs (that funds the Department of Homeland Security) failed to do anything to end or correct the cruel practice.
Last Friday, I proudly stood with hundreds of Third District residents as we exercised our First Amendment right to peacefully protest Donald Trump and Kevin Yoder's inhumane immigration policies.

We call on Rep. Yoder to be a voice of reason amid the cruelty and chaos created by the current administration.	5/5		#KS03 #KeepFamilesTogether
He has the ability to do much more than simply write letters. We call on Rep. Yoder to use his authority and office to stand up to Trump's anti-immigration agenda. To stop enabling cruel practices by our immigration officials. To protect Dreamers from deportation. 	4/5
Yesterday, Rep. Yoder publicized a letter he sent AG Sessions asking him to end the Trump policy of separating families at our southern border. As the chair of the House Appropriations subcommittee on Homeland Security, Rep. Yoder has a leadership position on immigration.	3/5
Now, while thousands of children are being ripped from their families due to Trump's practices, Congressman Yoder has pulled a political stunt that achieves nothing. 	2/5
I cannot in good conscious congratulate Rep. Kevin Yoder on paying lip service to human rights in an attempt to placate constituents. For two years, Rep. Yoder has consistently voted with and defended Donald Trump.	1/5

I‚Äôm proud that I was arrested fighting for Dreamers. I‚Äôm proud of everyone who takes a stand and works to amplify their voices. This country promised to protect childhood arrivals and we must uphold that word.	#DACA #Dreamers #KS03
1000s of people demanded lawmakers take action on DACA. Part of this protest was a planned act of civil disobedience: about 200 of us gathered on the steps of the Capitol Building. After being told to leave 3 times, we were each arrested, booked, &amp; detained by the Capitol police.
I'm not speaking as a politician, but as an American &amp; a human. In Dec. 2017, I was in D.C. for a training. A close friend, who is a Kansan &amp; Dreamer, called while I was @ the airport. She was on her way to a DACA demonstration on Capitol Hill &amp; asked me to attend. Easy decision.
Personally, I refuse to be silent on this. I am compelled to fight for and protect all of our young people who grew up in the United States. That is my belief, my passion, and my promise.
I saw President Trump‚Äôs tweets on DACA this weekend. I heard his rhetoric on immigrants. Within all that noise, actual people are getting lost. Dreamers are our neighbors, colleagues and friends, yet they are being disregarded as pawns in a dysfunctional political game.
