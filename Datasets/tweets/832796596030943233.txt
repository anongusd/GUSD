There are more than 560 @USFWSRefuges in the United States. They were created to  give our native flora and fauna a space to live and prosper. #Refuge, according to the dictionary, is a place or situation providing #safety or shelter. Unfortunately, that is not always the case.

Even at doses that don’t kill #bees outright, they weaken bee #immune systems and impair critical brain functions, making it hard for them to find #food sources and leaving them vulnerable to #diseases and #pests. (2/2)
Neonicotinoid #pesticides -- produced by companies like Bayer and Syngenta -- are largely to blame. (1/2)
But the @EPA still won’t ban these chemicals -- even though its own scientists admit that they’re dangerous. (2/2)

40% of invertebrate #pollinator #species, including #bees and #butterflies, are on the brink of #extinction.
#Bees and other #pollinators are responsible for one in three bites of #food that we eat. But they’re dying at alarming rates. This year, #beekeepers reported losing an average of nearly half of their hives.
Help #save #bees from #toxic #pesticides: 		The @EPA has quietly pushed back its review of bee-killing #neonicotinoid pesticides another year. 		This is an attempt to avoid acting on these toxic chemicals, which are a leading cause of global bee declines.

The bill moves the current Choice funding account from #mandatory spending to #discretionary spending, but doesn’t protect it from automatic #sequestration #cuts when the legislation takes effect. https://t.co/nqCBCZNl0f
The legislation “lacks a sustainable source of funding to ensure that care is provided and protected in the long-term." https://t.co/nqCBCZNl0f
Walz also wanted to exempt the funding for the Choice program from potential sequestration cuts. https://t.co/nqCBCZNl0f
White House forced committee leaders to reject Democratic proposals, such as a yearly review of the ability to send #veterans to private care. https://t.co/nqCBCZNl0f
The Choice program was meant as a temporary fix following the 2014 VA wait-time scandal. It allows some #veterans to see private doctors, but only in cases where they have to wait more than 30 days for an appointment or drive more than 40 miles to a facility. https://t.co/nqCBCZNl0f
It also contains $5.2 billion to keep the Veterans Choice Program funded until the new system can be implemented. Without action, the program will run out of money by May 31. https://t.co/nqCBCZNl0f
The bill would expand the number of #veterans who are eligible to see private sector #health specialists, as well as entitle veterans enrolled in the VA system to see a private doctor twice a year without a copay. https://t.co/nqCBCZNl0f
A House panel on Tuesday advanced a massive #reform package for the Department of #Veterans Affairs (VA) that would overhaul access to private sector #care outside the VA #health system. 		https://t.co/BgmDSnOaR8

They now have until September of 2019 to either apply for different #immigration status — a tall order, since #TPS does not create a path toward #permanent #residency or #citizenship — or leave the country. https://t.co/Z7tOBi49uX
When ending the #TPS status, the Trump administration has given the immigrants time to leave the country. The wind-down periods have ranged from a year to 18 months for people from El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, Nepal &amp; Sudan whose TPS designations have been terminated. https://t.co/Z7tOBi49uX

Flake, who is retiring from Congress at the end of his term, said he's confident that the bill will generate enough economic growth to pay for itself, even though congressional scorekeepers estimate that the law will increase the #national #debt. https://t.co/02PFwhd5cO
Flake, however, said he's "going to have problems" if there's a desire to make the individual #tax cuts permanent without any offsets or an agreement to cut #mandatory #spending. https://t.co/02PFwhd5cO
Under Senate rules, a bill needs 60 votes to pass instead of a simple majority if it adds to the deficit outside of the 10-year budget window, so the individual tax cuts were given an expiration date. https://t.co/02PFwhd5cO
The #tax law #Republicans passed in December permanently slashed the #corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent but only cut taxes on the #individual side of the code for eight years.  		https://t.co/MmBTPktsg9

Educators in #Kentucky also demonstrated against years of stagnant or reduced budgets by a Republican-controlled legislature. #Teachers in #Arizona have threatened similar job actions.
The walkouts follow a two-week job action in #WestVirginia that prompted lawmakers to raise teachers' pay.
The protests reflect rising discontent after years of sluggish or declining public school spending in #Oklahoma, which ranked 47th among the 50 U.S. states in per-student expenditure, and 48th in average teacher salaries in 2016, according to the National Education Association.
