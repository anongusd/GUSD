RT @MattBrownCFB: This will be Clemson's fifth top-5 team. Four of them in the past four seasons
RT @NickStevensHSOT: Someone tell Clemson to keep the clock running, please.
RT @TheBenSwain: If Clemson is able to win tonight, it will be ONLY due to Alabama looking ahead to Duke. Can’t change my mind.
RT @MarcACaputo: How much would you pay for a shot glass of Saban tears?
RT @ShannonSharpe: Clemson’s Def is hellacious. Thought Bama’s Def would play like that, but Clemson is the better tm, PLAIN AND SIMPLE

RT @Steelersdepot: ALoLabama
RT @YahooForde: Man, Clemson vs. Bama in the Red Zone has been a mismatch. Alabama has so much useless yardage.
RT @joeovies: 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 https://t.co/fqbd5LABtV
RT @Brett_McMurphy: Over-whelming
RT @YahooForde: Nick Saban has never gotten his ass kicked like this at Alabama. Never.
RT @ralphDrussoAP: Yeah. Notre Dame was definitely the problem last week.
RT @Alex_Kozora: Lawrence is unreal under pressure. What a throw and catch.
RT @ArmstrongABC11: make them cry out for mercy, Tigers
RT @WRALBobHolliday: Surprised Saban wasted a time out there. That was a catch all the way
RT @reddusfoximus: So cheesy. But, so good. https://t.co/gTGvXzHfWS

RT @DanWolken: Clemson holds. Wow. That might be it.
RT @YahooForde: This play is the game.
RT @lebrownlow: plenty of game left
@Switz Oklahoma. Back in the Sugar Bowl.
RT @DanWolken: Lot of football left. A 3-score game can become a 1-score game awful fast.

RT @MarcACaputo: An angel gets her wings when Bama, losing in a national title game, fails on a fake field goal
RT @DavidAFrench: The Commissioner of the SEC needs to declare a football emergency and seize field position by eminent domain.
RT @ralphDrussoAP: If you're going to fake it just leave the offense out and let your 5-star QB and 5-star WRs and 5-star RBs try to get th…
RT @Brett_McMurphy: Nick Saban unsuccessfully tries his inner Les Miles
RT @DanWolken: Alabama sends out Bulovas for a 40-yard field goal and it’s…. faked! And snuffed out. That’s a moment.
RT @YahooForde: Third-and-six -- is this a run call and four-down territory for Saban? Down 15 and the kicker is, shall we say, sketchy.
RT @jwgiglio: Drops, turnovers, coverage busts, procedural penalties. Alabama is playing like crap
RT @YahooForde: Well, this possession feels slightly important for Alabama.
RT @BryanDFischer: The final 30 minutes of the season.

RT @MattBrownCFB: Well if there's one thing we learned last year, it's that we should make definitive statements at halftime
RT @dannykanell: Trevor Lawrence played high school football last year https://t.co/5IJE3oZbLW
RT @DanWolken: Small win for Bama defense but Clemson adds a field goal to its lead. 31-16 with 45 seconds left in the half.
@varadmehta No way am I advocating this but if RBG doesn’t make it to June/July that would move Thomas’ retirement to probably next year, because I believe Thomas will retire this year if no one dies.
