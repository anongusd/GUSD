@FriendOfThurlow @llewellyngannon @realDonaldTrump I will say that @realDonaldTrump is #NotMyPresident.

@Scarlett_Sandy @AynRandPaulRyan In his eyes, Trump has an insane fear that the white race will be in the minority. I haven't seen Trump "incite" hope for African Americans, Hispanics and others. These people have been around long before you and me as well as Trump. A wall is racist.

Dear Trump Administration and Alan Dershoweitz,	You need to get a copy of the United States Constitution and READ IT FROM BEGINNING TO END. The 25th Amendment is the law! The US Constitution is the SUPREME LAW OF THE LAND!	AMERICA https://t.co/vB60T8Lnq9

@DonaldJTrumpJr @JordanSchachtel At least they see through the smoke screen that your father shows every day; he tells enough lies to the American people that his supporters just lap it up.

@LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary Is this so you can grill Mr. McCabe to a point where he won't give you any answers? #GOPCorruption in the Senate and House is apparent to those who see through you. You and Sen. McConnell are part of that #GOPCorruption and it is embarrassing. You have a bias toward Trump.
While I am glad that the DOJ, Andrew McCabe and Rod Rosenstein discussed invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office, I am very disappointed that they did not see it through. It would have saved this country a lot of hell with the shutdown. https://t.co/DF9co1L3mE
@realDonaldTrump We will make America Great Again when you are found guilty of collusion much less conspiracy with Russia in order to steal the 2016 election. You are the DISGRACE to the United States. You should be removed from office now.
I do not find it ironic that Trump goes on an insane Twitter rampage after McCabe confirms that people in Trump's cabinet met to discuss using the 25th Amendment to remove him from office. Trump loves to attack anyone who "double-crosses" him. Not surprised. https://t.co/euLzdUo6Gn
WHAT is a disgrace is that Trump is still president.  Mueller's report will show that the so-called "hoax" is not a hoax as Trump says it is. Trump is a #RussianAsset to Putin! Can't wait to see what is in the Mueller report! https://t.co/yIlPPVl9SQ

@RonDufresne @renato_mariotti @Jim_Jordan If I were a prosecutor, you better believe I would investigate. I would hope that I had enough to prosecute and send that person to jail which is where Jim Jordan belongs for covering up sexual abuse of college wrestlers at Ohio State. Unacceptable for a Rep in Congress.
@jamgilcw @Jim_Jordan The idiot wont pay attention to what Mueller is investigating. Like the rest of the corrupt #GOP, he can't seem figure out those criminals who have committed crimes are now indicted. He will never understand.
@chunkwhitetuna @Jim_Jordan I do too! I hope it gets him kicked out of Congress for good! Covering up sex abuse of wrestlers at OSU is a BIG NO-NO! I agree; it is not going away. He had better watch his step.
@JeffreyEiselman @Jim_Jordan Rep Jordan needs to be investigated for enabling a serial sexual predator not be fired? He allowed this sexual predator molest wrestlers and he watched! The guy needs to resign and hang his head in SHAME! DOES NOT DESERVE TO REPRESENT THE 4TH DISTRICT OF OHIO. BELONGS IN JAIL.
Ain't that the truth. Rep Jim Jordan is a total idiot. he can't seem to figure out the DOJ investigates crimes; when those crimes are committed, the DOJ investigates the person(s) who committed it. I wonder if his ears were clogged when Whitaker answered. #WhitakerHearing https://t.co/cVjCTCBqHI

@bobcesca_go @Jim_Jordan Since the Democrats have control of the House, I want them to investigate @Jim_Jordan with the scandal he is involved in at Ohio State. He should not be serving and representing his district from Ohio. Democrats need to demand his resignation now.
@EdKrassen You got that correct. Rep Jim Jordan is insane. How the people in the 4th district here in Central Ohio can keep sending him to Congress is beyond me. The guy is loony!!!
@imillhiser @Jim_Jordan Now that the Democrats are in control, I hope the House ethics committee investigate @Jim_Jordan for the cover up for a serial sexual predator at Ohio State. Rep Jordan is a disgrace to Ohio; to my father's own name; and to Congress. He deserves to be kicked out of Congress.
That would be a miracle. I doubt Rep Jim Jordan would have tried to help Ohio State wrestlers with that one tenth of energy that he uses helping the White House avoid accountability. He is just as complicit as the Trump Administration. https://t.co/JiE0Kohkvj

Where the hell Trump gets these numbers has got to be somewhere up his ass. He always inflates numbers just to appease his base. #SOTU https://t.co/i8qb3xBp7D
If the #GOPHypocrisy wants to believe that our economy is BOOMING, then why did our country lose as much money as it did during the #TrumpShutdown? #GOPHypocrisy  takes the cake. https://t.co/BrSHuz18O8
@Emma4Change As soon as he said that, I had to put my TV on mute. How can we have Greatness and Prosperity when we have two people on the Supreme Court who were accused of sexual assault? Only in this country will men believe men and not a woman. Change has to happen and now. #SOTU
#GOPHypocrisy  only believes in partisanship. That especially goes for Senators McConnell and Graham. Those two need to understand that they have to work with Democrats in the Senate as well as the House. #SOTU https://t.co/Tak89A4bnb
AMEN TO THAT! This administration is pure shit! It has NO IDEA what it is doing. Maybe we should force the #GOP and the #TrumpCrimeFamily to go hungry for a while and see how they would like it. I would be laughing til kingdom come! https://t.co/vm3potGrYQ
He lies about how great our economy is doing, and yet his #shutdown cost us $11 billion and $3 billion won't be recovered. This began at Christmas last year! If he #shutsdown the government again, we will be sitting ducks for terrorists AGAIN! HE IS A DANGER TO OUR COUNTRY! https://t.co/0zZ522feIY
When I saw some of the Democratic women wearing white to this #SOTU, I was proud. I knew the women who marched for a woman's right to vote would be pleased!  Positive my great-grandmother is dancing for joy with these women wearing white to send Trump a political message tonight! https://t.co/cTeYBTmRZQ
I waited long enough to hear "Madam Speaker, the President of the United States" and the #sociopathinchief to say "Madam Speaker" before launching into the #SOTU2019. After he acknowledged Speaker Pelosi, the mute button went on. Looking forward to the Democratic response! https://t.co/5S7yUEqdad
@JeanTer82510682 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Speaker Pelosi and Sen Schumer are willing to work with that #sociopathinchief so long as he stops demanding that  racist hateful wall along the Southern Border. He can't unify this country with his racist and hateful views. He is not a Christian; if he was, he would act upon it
@Gale46924907 I can't believe that you would believe the lies of the #sociopathinchief. The idiot is racist, wants to make America "WHITE" again which ain't gonna happen. I want our country HEALED BUT BY A DEMOCRAT WHO CAN LEAD! This #sociopathinchief CAN'T LEAD! He knows how to KISS ASS!
@pilitobar87 @BernieSanders @berrniesanders should not upstage a black woman after Stacey Abrams gives the Democratic Response to the #SOTU. I personally don't want him running for president as well. Sen Sanders should just keep quiet and let Stacey Abrams talk tonight.  #SOTU  #AbramsAddress
I love it when the Democratic party MAKES history! 2016, we made history by nominating our first female to be presidential candidate; 2018 Stacey Abrams runs for governor of Georgia and now she will be giving the #SOTUResponse this evening! Way to go Stacey! https://t.co/Ocm2E2Ey6z
I STAND WITH @staceyabrams! I look forward to listening to the  #AbramsAddress tonight! https://t.co/7i0rQfm4im
This #StateOfTheUnion will be another "Show Man" talks which will undoubtly be full of BS, division, and LIES! Who the hell wants to hear his "self-grandiose" lies anyway? I don't. I want to tune in and listen to #AbramsAddress https://t.co/M1lPXfCiZd
I cried when I heard the news of his death. I was very angry when I heard the verdict at Zimmerman's trial; I felt it was a major miscarriage of justice and I still believe it. This country hasn't done anything remotely decent when it comes to gun control and racism. I blame GOP https://t.co/lgXUkq2cRa
Ben Shapiro needs some COMMON SENSE pounded into him. Racism is not going to UNIFY this country. If Zimmerman had done what he was told in the first place, Trayvon Martin would be with us today! Ben Shapiro also needs a SHOT OF COMPASSION! https://t.co/3aO5vF6Hry
In memory of Trayvon Martin, I want to wish him a Happy Birthday on what would have been his 24th birthday. You, Trayvon, live on in our hearts. You will never be forgotten. Rest In Peace. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/HWNe49bm8M
Let us never forget Trayvon Martin and those whose lives cut short by gun violence from police, those on block watches, and even gangs. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/fClGQIyUi6
ALL those whose lives were cut short by police officers or those on block watches are an inspiration to those of us fighting for equality among all races and gun control. https://t.co/tRShJuZcAp
I want justice for Trayvon Martin and all the young unarmed teenagers, albeit white or black, who are killed by armed police officers and those who are on "block watches". Those on "block watches" NEED more training NOW ESPECIALLY WITH FIREARMS! https://t.co/0N5kf39plD
Zimmerman was told by the dispatcher to wait until the police got the scene before acting and he didn't; if he had waited for police to come onto the scene, Trayvon Martin just might still be with us today. https://t.co/NIXp9sfpQf
I remember wanting to throw something at the wall when I heard the verdict that George Zimmerman was found "not guilty" even though he killed an unarmed child in cold blood. Zimmerman deserves jail time not "free time". a miscarriage of justice was done with that verdict. https://t.co/dm9V8ZS6Ot
@SenSchumer More evidence that @realDonaldTrump can't unify this country?  I doubt his State of teh Union address will unify this country. He has divided it so much that I wonder how long it will take to heal. His promises don't mean a thing.
@JoyceWhiteVance I know what you mean. The last State of the Union I watched was President Obama's last State of the Union. I don't know how anyone can believe this #sociopath's state of the union's address tonight on any year. He lies! Can't wait to her Stacey Abrams give the Democratic response
I will have the #StateOfTheUnion on mute; when Stacey Abrams comes on to give the Democrat response, I will put my TV's volume back on. I mean, who wants to hear the #sociopath-in-chief's #StateOfTheUnion address when we all know it will continue to divide the nation? https://t.co/CxWmmxLz4C
@LeeKing09827121 @Christiniaz @RalphNortham So TRUE! Progressive Democrats will be running this country soon. Republicans are going to have to like it that progress is coming and that goes for the #sociopath-in-chief's base (SAnn Coulter and Rush Limbaugh to name a couple) to get over it. Republican dinosaurs will be gone
@peggyjags Oh, absolutely! He'll take a trip to Mar-A-Logo to play golf while all those Fed Employees are on furlough. If the #GOP get off their ass and tell the president NO to another shutdown, I can see both he and Lindsey Graham ripping their hair out of their heads! #Impeachment time!
Doubt it. If he furloughs all those Fed Employees again, we will hear his Commerce Secretary say "I don't understand why these people have to go to a food pantry. They can get bank loans." #ExecutiveTime means working your ass off when you are president. It doesnt mean being lazy https://t.co/kLnTUtH98G
AMEN! @realDonaldTrump needs to return permanently to Mar-A-Lago and spend the rest of his worthless life in #ExecutiveTimeOut! It is the only way for the rest of us to heal our country back to health. https://t.co/1ipdh7jPqU
@soaked2thebone Me too! I have a lot of #ExecutiveTime because of retirement. I also find things to do to keep me active and not just wasting time. Good thing I am not like our "extra terrestrial" in the White House thinking he is "working" when it is not! It doesn't have enough brain cells!

@Christiniaz @LeeKing09827121 Just so you understand my perspective: I am not for abortion because someone did not take any kind of protection.

@LeeKing09827121 @Christiniaz he will say at his news conference today. Will not prejudge what he will say since I don't know what that speech will say.
@LeeKing09827121 @Christiniaz I am glad that he is one of the most progressive governors.

@ukwildcatfan191 @thehill @realDonaldTrump You want to know WHO HAS DIVIDED THIS NATION? Your MORON-IN-CHIEF! Ask yourself this question: were our ancestors "illegal" immigrants when they came to the "new" world back in the 1600s? Nope. They took the lands that belonged to the NATIVE AMERICAN INDIANS! WE WERE THE ILLIGALS
@CryptonRon @WIRED @realDonaldTrump NO I DON'T THINK @realDonaldTrump HAS A BRAIN. He insults his own INTEL CHIEFS AND HE CAN'T EVEN SPELL! He tells them they have to go back to school; he sure FLUNKED grammar! So no, Donald Trump does not have a brain. He is Putin's puppet and does Putin's bidding
@ukwildcatfan191 @thehill @realDonaldTrump You have been watching too much Ann Coulter and listening too much to Rush Limbaugh -- two DANGEROUS PEOPLE TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA! I do plenty of reading and research. Your first sentence is an INSULT and one I REFUSE to even respond to. You are embarrassing yourself!
@chillsmyname @joeynoe @AbouAmara @Starbucks @SenWarren @HowardSchultz @realDonaldTrump I know what you mean. I just want this country to prosper though not with Trump. He is bankrupting our country. Can a differnt billionair do that and help make this country prosper like it had been long before George W? Health care reform has to be done FAIRLY!
@ukwildcatfan191 @thehill @realDonaldTrump You are the one who is "brainwashed" by your moron-in-chief. I do think for myself. North Korea is still building missiles; Iran is abiding the agreement they made with Secretary Kerry. Listen to the Intel Chief's in your moron-in-chiefs' administration.
@ukwildcatfan191 @thehill @realDonaldTrump THAT IS A NATIONAL SECURITY! Your attitude toward illegal immigrants tells me that your #racist. I LIVE  BY THE TEACHINGS OF JESUS CHRIST! I respect the dignity of human being regardless if they are immigrants or native-born Americans.  I live by the Golden Rule.  #GOPCorruption
@ukwildcatfan191 @thehill @realDonaldTrump oH, AND THAT ATTACK ON A GAY BLACK ACTOR WAS NOT WARRANTED by 2 white males wearing a #MAGA hat yelling "this is maga country"? I call that #racist as well as HATRED! BTW Russia, North Korea, Iran,  ISIS are our ENEMIES. Russia, North Korea, and Iran are not our ALLIES.
@RodneyClaeys @maiamimi There are 2 states WITH NO minimum wage; Georgia and Wyoming. That is pathic since one has to work up to 3 jobs to make ends meet. the cost of living keeps going up and wages are stagnent especially women's pay. We need fair pay for women as well as a fair minimem wage !
A little nervous with Warren's stance on weath tax; does she really think it will work? I am not sure it will work as it is a far right idea. Yes, I want the wealthy to pay their fair shar in taxes and not have this tax break that Trump gave them. Democrats need common ground https://t.co/UgJsPBnYS7
So why doesn't he put Veteran's Day and Election Day together? Most of federal employees are veterans anyway. That would help with voter turn out. Is really afraid of voter turn out will help the Democrats or will it help both parties? He's screwed up in the head! https://t.co/Yg7Hkae46P
Anybody who says that they are "above the law" will see himself/herself into massive trouble. NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW. Karma will catch up to Trump one of these days and he won't like it. https://t.co/dyeOMEPNj6
Trump believes his '"so called" religion means he can DO anything he damn well please and not get into trouble. He says he knows "more than the generals do as well as the Intel chief's do" yet we know better. Needs to get on his knees and beg for forgiveness from Americans + God https://t.co/RsAFBOMbfV
The base at Fox are really freaking out now that Roger Stone has been arrested. Linking Sonte's arrest to what happened in Benghazi and the raid on bin Laden ain't equal. Three separate items. #GOP are terrified that Trump will be impeached and possibly convicted! #CORRUPTION https://t.co/g3O8KeNVU1
@realDonaldTrump tells his Intel cheif's that hey need to go back to school and he can't listen to them is dispicable. He should be listening to what they say to make our country safe; his vanity wall is not going to make us safe. @realDonaldTrump , listen to your Intel cheif's! https://t.co/62NPGxsHsr
I think it is a close tie. Both of them side with the president so they lie quite a bit.  I don't either of them would vote to #convict Trump if Trump is #Impeached.  I can't really say who lies more: McTurtle and Graham lie equally. https://t.co/626oD64PHn
@krassenstein I hope Sahra Sanders gets her brain checked. I don't think God wanted Donald Trunp to become president. I think God wanted President Obama's policies to be saved through Hilary. He wanted the Democratic take control of Conress and put better justices on the Supreme Court.
@ukwildcatfan191 @thehill @realDonaldTrump's #Racism has helped to add fuel to the fire of hated and #Violence in #America. His #MAGA hats are this century's KKK hoods. His foreign Policies have put #America in danger. He won't listen to his Intel chiefs who knows more than him. #ImpeachTrump
#GOP does stand for #VoterSuppression which is sad in a #Democracy. We have #VotingRights  which the #GOP and its #corruptive cohorts don't want us to have. Stand by to #VoteThemOut https://t.co/NoA26tXnYO
@waltshaub @SenSchumer Putting Veterans Day on #ElectionDay is a GREAT IDEA! McConnell probably would not refuse that idea. Veterans are people we honor because of what they did: fight for our freedoms! Putting those two days together is a good idea.
This is just another way for McTurtle to hurt not only Federal Workers but also ALL Americans. He already hurt 800,000 federal employees with that #Shameless #shutdown. It's just another way for McTurtle to maintain control in the Senate by screwing with #VotingRights. https://t.co/uK7UdlZVyE

@EdKrassen Mitch McConnell is a COWARD pure and simple. He doesn't want to lose control in the Senate. I hope he loses his seat in the Senate next year. #ElectionDay needs to be a federal holiday; more Americans would be able to cast their votes more easily! McConnell and Trump are cowards

@TheRickyDavila I am not surprised that Pervert Jim Jordan expressed his outrage over this issue. He doesn't want to see #ElectionDay made to be a federal holiday. No #GOP wants to see that; they would lose control in every state much less nationally. Both Jordan and McConnell should be ashamed
After also being responsible for the longest #shutdown, McTurtle is now mocking the idea of making #ElectionDay a paid holiday for fed employees. Shameful. Ought to hang his head in total shame. https://t.co/kTYBSjnHuS
I am not surprised that McTurtle doesn't want a federal holiday for #ElectionDay. His excuse that it is a "power grab" by Democrats is bogus. He doesn't see that people have a difficult time getting to the polls either before or after work on #ElectionDay. McTurtle has lost it https://t.co/ZD9eI6BLpD

@thehill Thank you, Congressman Schiff! I hope the Intel chiefs' hearing does "undermine" Trump's ability to declare emergency for border wall. Our national security is with Russia, North Korea, Iran, ISIS, and Syria &amp; their capabilities to hack into our elections, possible electric grid
@krassenstein We're screwed with his statement on "I know more than the generals do" as well. I think it is every #resisters hope that #mueller's report will help begin the Articles of Impeachment proceedings against Trump. I hope this happens soon!
In all my years of voting, I can't ever recall a President openly criticizing the heads of the agency's tasked to protect our country.

@WalshFreedom Trump will ALWAYS make up shit like what he said about ISIS, North Korea and  even Russia. I watched what Trump's own Intel Chiefs told Congress about ISIS, North Korea &amp; Russia. I think it will always be normal for Trump to trash anyone who contradicts him on what he says to us.
@Pappiness yeah. this moron-in-chief sure doesn't know how to spell; does he? If had taken an English class from my mother, she would have given him an "F" for grammar and he would be screaming. He sure doesn't understand his intelligence community does he?

@MichaelAvenatti I highly doubt that the White House will denounce the outrageous criminal conduct that took place this morning. There is no place for it in America. #JusticeForJussie Homophobic, Racist attacks are increasing thanks to our moron in chief's own #RACISM and hate.
@ericswalwell Ain't that the truth. The hate crimes increased only because of @realDonaldTrump winning in 2016. His #Racist and hate-filled rhetoric is what is helping to increase these hate crimes. I can only pray that we begin to reject the hate-filled and #Racist rhetoric soon.
Dear @realDonaldTrump,	Your #racist and #HateSpeech are adding fuel to the fire. We have more #Violence  in our nation thanks to you. I hold you accountable for what happened to Jussie Smollett when two people attacked him, put a rope around his neck, fractured a rib 	America https://t.co/FsKqk3JtqI
@AshleeMPreston I am also deeply disturbed by the headlines detailing the gruesome, racist/homophobic bashing Jussie Smollett endured. What happened to him cannot be allowed to happen again. #JusticeForJussie #JussieSmollett We are better than those two idiots who attacked #JussieSmollett
@MrErnestOwens While it is bad enough that a black, gay actor was attacked in Chicago today, it sure did not make those two idiots look any better. It sure made them look worse than those brats at #CovingtonCatholicHigh. I hope that Jussie Smollett gets well soon. Love heals all! Hate divides
@ProudResister @realDonaldTrump This act is a hate crime. We don't live in an era where it was fine to put people in a noose and hang them. We live in the 21st century where #RACISM  and hatred are prevalent because of @realDonaldTrump. #maga  is full of violence and the hat is this century's new KKK hood.
I never thought I would ever live to see the day when I would agree that this hat reading "Make America Great Again" is the 21st Century KKK hood. We all can "thank" the #racist-in-chief for his message of hate and #RACISM. https://t.co/GfX1b4tnve

THAT is one response to the STOU I can't wait to hear. I respect Stacey Abrams and I will be looking forward to hearing her response to @realDonaldTrump's #SOTU  address. I suppose I can put the mute button his speech and just listen to Stacey Abrams.  DVR time! https://t.co/VFYtq5Ftgn

@realDonaldTrump You are the embarrassment to our Country! You did not SERVE in the military and yet you think you know "more" than the generals do. You don't know more than the generals do as you are not on the battlefield. You were never in Vietnam either as you were a draft dodger. SHAMEFUL.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Maybe he thinks that another Republican will challenge your father. I am sure that a strong Democrat can win back the White House and get rid of the racism your father has brought to this country.
If Jeff Flake comes out against another #TrumpShutdown I will be glad. I think he was against the first #TrumpShutdown   in the first place.

@AbouAmara @joeynoe @Starbucks @SenWarren @HowardSchultz @realDonaldTrump The Democratic Party was born with the election of Andrew Jackson. The Republican party used to be the Whig party.

@AbouAmara @joeynoe @Starbucks @SenWarren @HowardSchultz @realDonaldTrump You had better relearn your history. At the time George Washington was president, we only had the FEDERALIST PARTY. He was UNANIMOUSLY ELECTED. FIRST ELECTION WAS BETWEEN JOHN ADAMS AND THOMAS JEFFERSON IN THE ELECTION OF 1800. Jefferson was a Democrat-Republican.
@joeynoe @AbouAmara @Starbucks @SenWarren @HowardSchultz @realDonaldTrump Don't insult my intelligence. I know there has never been a female president.

@joeynoe @AbouAmara @Starbucks @SenWarren @HowardSchultz @realDonaldTrump Our founding fathers did not anticipate that we would get a president like Trump.

@joeynoe @AbouAmara @Starbucks @SenWarren @HowardSchultz @realDonaldTrump I do vote Democrat. I want a candidate who can win the 2020 election and send Trump back to New York or to Mar-a-Logo. If Howard does run, I do hope that it does take a large amount of GOP votes.
@joeynoe @AbouAmara @Starbucks @SenWarren @HowardSchultz @realDonaldTrump I am doing grassroots volunteering.

@TheRickyDavila @realDonaldTrump wants ALL of us to know he has "Christian" ethics when doesn't. He wants us all to know that he was raised in a "Christian" home. The moron has zero Christian ethics since he sure doesn't live up to those so-called "Christian" ethics.
I agree with this. Teachers need to be teaching civics, the Constitution, life skills as well as financial skills. Bible literacy has no business being taught in our schools. https://t.co/L6YRZ3Ecrb
@pattiimint3737 @joncoopertweets @MarilynLouise5 AGREE! We need to work on LITERACY. We have an educational system that is nowhere near in comparision to other countries in the world. We need to focus on literacy first. Bible literacy should be on the "back burner".
@S_KYLERR Couldn't agree with you more. Schools should teach financial literacy as well as teaching LIFE SKILLS. Sure would have helped me when I was in school. I don't think bible literacy should even be considered.
@EdKrassen I don't believe that a man who created on all of his wives and is accused of raping one of his ex-wives actually reads the Bible. The man does not have Christian ethics at all.
@realDonaldTrump You claim that you were raised in a "Christian home". You do not have "Christian" ethics. If you did have Christian ethics, you would not make outrageous lies and want to build a racist wall. Jesus Christ ACCEPTED EVERYONE! HE WAS NOT RACIST.
@TheMartieSirois @robreiner @realDonaldTrump I so agree with you. We need people who know how the Constitution, the co-equal branches of government works. People who can work with both parties and not demand something or they will shutdown the government for a long period of time putting our nations security at risk.

@AbouAmara @Starbucks No billionaire is in touch with reality. They don't know the plight of the working middle class who are working 2-3 jobs to make ends meet. We should only be working one job to make ends meet. Billionaires don't have the constitutional law background like other politicians.
@Kris_Sacrebleu I know what you mean. We don't need another BILLIONAIRE who has zero concept of what running country is all about. It takes having a political background like the other candidates who have announced their intent to run for president next year. You have to be in touch with reality

@JoeSteelerFan @realDonaldTrump @KamalaHarris Can you see Kamala getting the nomination, winning the 2020 election and heaven forbid the attendance at her inauguration is twice the size of Obama's 2009 inauguration? I can see @realDonaldTrump  going bonkers? small violin playing for Trump!
Kamala has a pleasant smile, a great laugh and a way to win votes! I hope she becomes the Democratic nominee in 2020. I think she can kick Trump's ass. #KamalaHarris2020  #KamalaHarrisForThePeople https://t.co/LwQvtYvQvJ
@AsiramThe I know what you mean. I wonder what my father thought of Kamala's speech today. I am impressed by her; she would make a far better president than Hillary would ever have made. Let's not pull another 2016. Go, Kamala! #KamalaHarris2020 #KamalaHarrisForThePeople
@cmclymer The other candidate are going to see if they can meet that high bar that Kamala Harris set with her great speech. I loved that ambitious, strong, and compassionate tone; I haven't heard that kind of tone in years (probably not since Obama gave his announcement speech in 2007)
I would be proud to vote for Kamala in the primaries here in Ohio as well as in the General Election. Go, Kamala! #KamalaHarrisForThePeople  #KamalaHarris2020 https://t.co/cIdrldwqAm
@Lanai_Lingerie @KamalaHarris If Kamala Harris comes to Columbus, OH I will be at that rally. I really like what she has to say. While I like some of what Warren says, I am not sure that Gillibrand can win. #KamalaHarris2020  #KamalaHarrisForThePeople
@scottshafer @KamalaHarris That was one of my favorite lines in Kamala's announcement today. @KamalaHarris  #KamalaHarris2020  #KamalaHarrisForThePeople
@AishaMoodMills And a Black woman who I believe can win! I don't think Trump would know how to deal with someone like Kamala Harris.
Just joined Kamala Harris' team! I heard her announcement and it was a great announcement. https://t.co/7LToNQhlQK
@robreiner I know our Founders could not imagine a US without a free press. I don't think they thought we would ever have a president like the moron we have. His BS is only electrifying his base but probably not the others who voted for him. Thank God for the #ReSisters #RESISTANCE
@small_ann The bully you are referring to is @realDonaldTrump. He is a #RussianAsset  who is doing #Putin's bidding. @realDonaldTrump  is a THREAT to our #NationalSecurity. Mueller BELIEVES in Due Process. Your precious president does not.
@StevenBeschloss I would appreciate having a president who demanded healthcare for all, debt-free education, an end to fossil fuel; someone who grasped our challenges and sought to improve our lives. I would also appreciate having a president with energy to do those things. don't see it in Trump
@atDavidHoffman Having Hillary on a ticket as a VP candidate would only be a disaster for any ticket. She has too much baggage that would not help that particular ticket win. She needs to stay out of the 2020 presidential election either running for president or vice president.
I would rather not see either Bernie and Hillary run for president again. I don't want to go through another 2016 again. They need to leave it to the younger crowd! We need new people. We don't need people like Hillary and Bernie. The DNC was just wanted a female in 2016. https://t.co/LrIvlod0Ww
@DougJones I am all for both bills. That shutdown did not have to happen if the president had signed the first bill in the first place. I hope there is a way to stop the president from doing something like this again. I do hope your bills pass.
@PalmerReport I bet that frown on Mitch McConnell's face will go down even lower when he hears about the targeting of him over Kremlin money. I hope the Democratic House goes after McConnell over Kremlin money; one way to get him out of the Senate!
@DisavowTrump20 I guess the results from the poll should indicate that Bernie Sanders should not run in 2020. I would support Kamala Harris for the Democratic nomination for President in 2020 any day.
@KamVTV She may be waiting until we have a Democrat in the White House. We can't fill her seat in an election year. The United States Supreme Court yearly term goes from the first Monday in October to June 30th.
@politvidchannel @h0n3y_73 Ted Cruz is an embarrassment to this Native Texan. This #Shutdown was a #MitchShutdown and a #TrumpShutdown. McTurtle and Trump did not VOTE to open the government; only Schumer and Pelosi voted to open the government. Cruz, McCarthy, and McTurtle need to get their FACTS straight
I will believe it when I see it. If Stone does cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller, I can see Trump being afraid of what Stone will say about Trump. I would say it is a wait and see game. Like I say, I will believe it when I see it. https://t.co/KISE7IxID6
@EndDeportations Out of that list, I would say the next to be indicted would be	- Donald Trump Jr	- Eric Trump	-  Ivanka Trump	- Jared Kushner	- Steve Bannon	-- Scaramucci	-- Trump's first AG	--Trump's first Secretary of State
@PamKeithFL Same here. The other priority is to beat the hell out of Trump in the Electoral College Count + the Popular Vote! I want to see a Democratic Candidate take on Trump in the debates to see if he can answer the questions he wouldn't when he faced Hillary Clinton.
@USMCLiberal I do wish Bernie would stop complaining about this particular group of people running for president in 2020. This particular group have the same platform, but in different ways to take that platform. All about to win back the  White House. we have to back who is best to win!
What we have right now in the Democratic Primary is what I call diversity! Bernie really needs to wrap his brain over that. It isn't using their identity to win or that "they don't care what they stand for". They do care what they stand for. We need to unify to win in 2020! https://t.co/1fHYgouFxZ
@GeorgeTakei @h0n3y_73 I can't wait to see how Mueller's report really begins to get Trump to start shaking in his shoes over what his advisors, during the 2016 campaign, will say. I would say Trump is beginning to freak out.
@ProudResister @LindaHall54 @realDonaldTrump Yeah. He screams about "caravans" invading our country and yet had undocumented immigrants at his properties. So happy he has been caught doing it and that it looks bad for him politically! Speaking with forked tongues! Con artist fake president.
@AhmedBaba_ @DeepInTheHills @KamalaHarris I support Kamala Harris. I supported Obama. Kamala Harris is a beautiful woman who can go toe-to-toe with Trump on any debate. she's got more political experience and law experience than he does. We should never question the "blackness" of her.
@Demarcu81098941 I thank those federal security workers working without getting paid. I appreciate what they did for keeping us safe.
@Strandjunker @realDonaldTrump I don't think @realDonaldTrump even has a clue to what "caravan" Dakota Theriot and Zephen Xaver were in. @realDonaldTrump uses fear to divide our country. Needs to heed Pope Francis' words "builders of walls sow fear and divide"
@realDonaldTrump Where on earth did you get your so called "stats"? Your #Shutdown cost MORE than what your precious racist vanity wall did. Pope Francis said "builders of walls sow fear and divide". You had better heed his words. You are NOT a Christian. Illegal crossings at LOWEST in YEARS!
@MKGenest If the #GOP were still the Party of Lincoln, I would be okay with the elephant that is still the current mascot. Since @realDonaldTrump became president and destroyed the Lincoln Party, why don't we use the Devil as the mascot for the #GOP? Trump is evil so it would be perfect
Chocolate cake with chocolate icing looks good. I could even go for a chocolate cake with white icing and chocolate chips on top of it. #NationalChocolateCakeDay 	which icing would you want on a chocolate cake? https://t.co/LqePZFXnQq

Perfect picture of McCarthy kissing Trump's ass and doing his bidding! This picture just made my day! #MeetThePress #MTP #TrumpCaved  #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/60RomG2zR8
@mabri1741 Kevin McCarthy is a useless tool. He's as much of a fool like Paul Ryan is. #GOP in Congress are fools anyway. They choose fools as their leaders. McCarthy needs to be replaced at his next reelection.
@SusanMu70359266 Kevin McCarthy needs to get his eyes checked if he thinks that Pelosi didn't negotiate with Trump. What she won't negotiate with is funding for a wall. I doubt he remembers how McConnell and the Republicans were so willing to work with Obama. McCarthy is like Trump: A BIG LIAR!
@RWitchger Yep. Now we all have to try to come with a great nickname for this jackass. I mean we had #lyingRyan for Paul Ryan. Now we have McTurtle for Sen McConnell. Any ideas for McCarthy?
McCarthy needs to listen to Pope Francis when he says "builders of walls sow fear and divide". McCarthy's interview with Chuck Todd made me ill. https://t.co/PpVjSwoDu1
AMEN! Can we say: CORRUPTION in the #GOP? Trump, Graham, McTrutle, Cotton, King, Nunes and now McCarthy need to be taken out of the White House &amp; the Capitol in handcuffs! They are so corrupt that they crippled the #GOP https://t.co/Jic4usMcfj
@johnpavlovitz I sure did not see it in any of the "Bible claims....." in the OT. I wish Christians would stop saying "The Bible says being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender is a sin." These so-called Christians believe in a vengeful God. I believe in a loving God who ACCEPTS EVERYONE!
@johnlundin Pope Francis has it correct when he says "builders of walls" sow fear and divide. Maybe Hannity and Coulter need to listen (i know that won't happen) to what Pope Francis has to say. Walls sow fear and divide. Thank you, Pope Francis. #SundayMorning
The perfect picture of McTurtle! He is a prehistoric monster who has had his run of the Senate and is now finding himself looking at "extinction" with his reelection in 2020. Just look at those bags under the eyes, the frown on the face, the stone look on the face. He aint' there https://t.co/c7FnfOqDJZ
Civility? @realDonaldTrump show any kind of civility? there is no way that @realDonaldTrump will ever be civilized to anyone. I don't see @realDonaldTrump ever being civilized to anyone BUT himself. https://t.co/XIY8NzR4FU
@johnpavlovitz I wish you blessings. I pray that your new church will live up to what you want to do. Treat people the way you want to be treated. I hope that you can covert as many white Evangelicals so they can repent their sins BIG time. May they learn the teachings of Jesus Christ.
I doubt @realDonaldTrump will observe #HolocaustRemembranceDay since I am sure he can't remember anything about it. People in my generation know about it and #remember the #Holocaust. #SundayMorning  Have a good day! https://t.co/SPEMNjBg72
@johnpavlovitz I am not surprised Graham and Falwell have found affinity with Donald Trump. Graham scares me out of my wits. If Graham's attitude doesn't change, he'll be looking for another job next year. He best remember that stones can break glass windows; his just may be the first to break
@johnpavlovitz Over the years, I have seen people use the Bible as a weapon as do fundamentalists who like to hammer the Scriptures in their own way and not live in the teachings of Jesus. I find that to be so fake. I wish the Bible were not used as a weapon. There are some good teachings in it
@johnpavlovitz I would say that it is the Christian Right who are the "Godless hordes" that are coming to destroy America. Their idea of Christianity is so far from what I was taught. I was taught to love my neighbor and to treat others the way I want to be treated. I believe in a loving God.
I hope someone runs against @realDonaldTrump for the Republican presidential nomination. @realDonaldTrump is a felon &amp; a #RussianAssetInTheWhiteHouse. Someone needs to take him on in the primaries next year if he is not impeached, convicted and removed. https://t.co/sN2JDtR0bq
This is so very correct. Not voting is choosing the greater of 2 evils. I do hope my cousin was able to explain that to his son in 2016. We choose our presidents and pray that that person doesn't become like the #sociopath we have today. Always vote in every election. #BlueWave https://t.co/RaLiC540AG
@DailyCaller Wished I had seen that. Yes, that 16 year old Covington Catholic Student is a prick. The school has very poor ethics since they taunt black students on visiting teams like basket ball teams. Probably just as bad at football games. They need to learn how to respect people.
I think Ann Coulter's first clue, to finding out that Trump is a lying con man, was when he #caved into the Democrats over the #shutdown and the no #Funding  for his precious #racist #Wall. She will be so angry if he doesn't "build" that #Wall that she will tweet "You Lied" https://t.co/IxI1x5lYxh
@LaF3mm3Nikita @MalcolmNance In the first place, Jared Kushner should never have had his security clearance "overruled" when it was originally rejected. I would not trust him any more than I could pick up my car and throw it. This guy is a danger to our national security. Strip his security clearance please
and those 35 days of the #TrumpShutdown got him NOTHING! He played with people's lives; eventually grounded planes and #caved to Speaker Pelosi and McTurtle's telling him that McTurtle could not control the #GOP in the Senate. Made my day. What will happen in 21 days? Don't know https://t.co/kQ7ItCrToI
Top Criminal Trump just loves to surround himself with criminals! I wonder how long it will be before Roger Stone will begin to crack and then turn on Trump like Cohen has. Be interesting to see. I'd love to see him "guilty on all counts" like Manafort. My day will be HAPPY! https://t.co/ceF710baYR
@activist360 Let's hope Nina Turner, Susan Sarandon, Cornel West, and David Sirta had their eyes opened these past two years as to what Trump is like. I can only hope that they will support a Democrat in #2020 rather than a #sociopath like Trump.
I get a kick out Jared's security clearance being "rejected" at first but then "overruled" by a Trump appointee. No wonder this administration is SO CORRUPT! Trump and Jared are a danger to our national security. Jared's security clearance needs to be stripped from him NOW! https://t.co/NUFDyyxzRs
@amjoyshow @aroseblush @MalcolmNance Jared Kushner should never have been given clearance to any classified documents given his many modifications on his SF-86 security form. The guy is a danger to our national security!
@EdKrassen I want to see President Trump being indicted. A sitting president should be able to be indicted no matter what. This jackass is not above the law. I am wish you on this!
Don't forget Eric and Lara Trump to that list of treasonwats! I would love to see their doors kicked in. The doors of	Trump	Trump Jr	Kushner and Ivanka	Pence and family	Hannity	Coulter	Britebart	Rush Limbaugh	Eric and Lara 	I would be laughing so hard my sides would be hurting! https://t.co/USGKcWxIaz
2 words I would describe Trump are: "unstable" and "vain". I could also come up with "asshole", "racist", "white supremacist". https://t.co/yjB51jjWia
the "great negotiator" just caved to a woman! for someone whose ego gets deflated big time, this must sting hard. wonder how long it will take for the "great negotiator" to learn you don't send a child like Jared to "negotiate" immigration reform to Congress? Probably never. https://t.co/gT1OBn96hm
that is a perfect "nickname" for Nancy Pelosi! I love the sound of President Pelosi. https://t.co/Km2B92U4qa
I don't think Trump is going to like Cohen "airing" out Trump's dirty laundry. I am looking forward to Cohen's testimony on February 12th. Going to be interesting to hear what Cohen has to say. https://t.co/4mUQ1c62it
Those who are Bernie Sanders die hards and those who are not, we have to be united if we want to retake the White House next year. It won't matter who the Democratic Presidential nominee will be; we have to back that person in a UNITED FRONT! #BLUEWAVE2020 https://t.co/ICPKd1Avnf
@Rex34058419 @DRK1224 Dems CAN interpret what WE read. It is you conservatives that can't interpret what you read. Trump CAVED into Democrats yesterday by SIGNING a bill he has previously said he would not sign. I guess you like having your president put your own life in danger with a shutdown.
I bet @HillaryClinton wass all smiles this morning when she heard the news about Roger Stone being arrested this morning. I know I was all smiles this morning! https://t.co/nC6w8ZMj5W

Made my morning with that news! Why make a movie about "Trumpgate? We have the real characters in this drama. Just saw some not so great news though: Stone was released on a $250,000 bond. Wished he had been remanded. Let's hope he sees the inside of a jail very soon! https://t.co/te8YlMASiU
I just love today! #FelonyFriday !!! Waking up to the news of Stone's arrest, made my entire day! #MuellerTime https://t.co/YkAEZyhyNn
Amen! #FelonyFriday is the greatest day this week! Not so great for Roger Stone and his pal, Trump. #ByeBye, Stone. #ByeBye, Trump! It's #MuellerTime as #MuellerIsComingForYou. Be ready to go to prison! https://t.co/lPsVb3biRD
@realDonadTrummp This is not #FakeNews as you want us to believe. The FBI was not visiting Stone just for some "morning coffee" when they went to Stone's house and arrested him. It is you that is #FakeNews.  #MuellerFriday  #FelonyFriday #MuellerTime
Trump's tweets about Stone won't help him; it will only hurt him. He will always deny any involvement with #Russia and will say #NoCollusion #NoConspiracy not to mention that he is not a #RussianAsset. #felonyfriday  #MuellerFriday #MuellerTime https://t.co/PwLafO4tkG
I bet that Hillary Clinton is waking up on this fabulous #MuellerFriday morning to the news of Roger Stone's arrest in Fort Lauderdale, FL. I know I am jumping for joy! #FelonyFriday #MuellerTime https://t.co/3ADo6UKNas
And I can't wait for more indictments to come! I get a big kick out the #psychopath saying Stone is his "good friend &amp; advisor" and then saying "I don't even know him".  The #psychopath can't keep his lies straight.  He also says "I DON'T WANT TO GO TO PRISON".  he's going there https://t.co/dPApKxEcFL
@realDonaldTrFan You will be going to prison. I am glad that Roger Stone was arrested. You asked #Russia for Hillary's emails and Stone was able to get you information. How can you call him your "good friend &amp;advisor" and then say you don't know Stone? Which is it? #MuellerFriday #MuellerTime
I can see Hillary Clinton writing a book with that title. It would be a BEST SELLER! I would be one of the first people in line buying it. I don't think Hillary will be arrested or indicted. Nice to see more of Trump's people being arrested and indicted. https://t.co/A8j3Op1OHP
Hope law enforcement takes Stone's as means of Stone's actions with Wiki Leaks. I would be so happy if Stone did not have a house to come home to after he gets out of prison. How many people will be happy with that? https://t.co/TwJrEUTsX6
Be interesting to hear the excuses Stone will come up with on #IndictmentFriday. This dirty trickster really has no regret  for his actions just to get a criminal elected president https://t.co/FKdK5ZWrln
RT @johnpavlovitz: "We will not be leveled by the infected ego of an unstable, ignoble man—and those opportunistic monsters willing to sell…
Love this picture and the caption underneath. "What could possibly go wrong?" In this case: EVERYTHING! Trump is being investigated by Mueller for #Russiagate #conspiracy #Collusion #WitnessTampering and anything that goes with #Russiagate. https://t.co/4FGfq7TnSc
Stone must like criminal presidents. He's got a tattoo of Nixon's face on his back. Will he now tattoo a face of Trump below the one of Nixon? Probably. https://t.co/YzKjKaVWL3
Can't wait to hear those Stone associates talk about Stone before Mueller and his Washington grand jury. Will some turn on Stone? It's a wait and see. Why do we need to make a movie of this? It's already being made right now and by real people playing themselves! https://t.co/z9IrRROoia
Made my morning  to hear that Roger Stone was arrested and charged with witness tampering, obstruction and false statements about his interactions related to Wikileaks of hacked email during the 2016 presidential election. Make room for a traitor in prison, FBI! https://t.co/f6Ystx1Pcp
This news of Roger Stone being arrested made my morning! I love the counts against him! The last one being witness tampering -- let's hope that helps to bring Trump down! Open up the prison cells, FBI! Here comes one of Trump's cronies. Prepare one for Trump. https://t.co/3bKPXaMEn4
@UWS10025 @NiceBigBuns @thomaskaine5 I believe you have to fly to another country to take a cruise from another country. That is why I think I am waiting until this shutdown has ended before I fly anywhere. I want to be safe.
@davidhogg111 Keep it up! While in college, see if you can help with voter turnout for 2020! Let's get a Democrat back in the White House
Way to go, Sen Bennet! Give Sen Cruz a good swift kick in the ass! The man had no heart for his fellow Texans in 2013 at that #Shutdown; there is no way in hell he will have a heart to reopen the government now.  Sen Cruz will never have a heart for other's suffering. https://t.co/wt4o49q8CP
@realDonaldTrump had better realize that people who are on Social Security Disability and Social Security get their checks from the Treasury. Does he really want to invade the Treasury without having seniors and those who are disabled rise up and revolt? https://t.co/7ShPaLASXn
@DLind @mnlally Which is going against the 13th Amendment. People in the United States are not SLAVES! Unfortunately, our government doesn't seem to understand that and take it out on our federal employees which in turn hurts the economy and the rest of Americans.

Would be nice if McTurtle and Schumer could just sit and negotiate. I am about to blame both of these two for the continuing shutdown. McTurtle for not allowing House bills to come to a vote until today; Schumer for not trying to work with GOP. https://t.co/gkklEclXZF
@SenatorCollins Please tell Sen McConnell to compromise with Democrats. You might also suggest that to Sen Schumer. Compromise is not a dirty word. I want this government shutdown to come to an end. Our national security is at risk.
Trump's EGO is his world! if anyone tries to deflate it, he feels wounded. sure, a porn star told the world his private parts resemble a small mushroom. What's demoralizing: his approval ratings dropping rapidly while Pelosi's is soaring! Go Pelosi! You, go, girl! https://t.co/psphUBBDcD

All I can say is I am glad that I do not belong to the Roman Catholic church.  I don't agree with many of their edicts and especially after witnessing what the #CovingtonCatholic Boys did while in Washington DC.

@shellybolcf @AOC I think the reason Genesis 3 was left out was to get Sarah Sanders to open her eyes that God said the world was good 7 times when he created it. Yes, sin did come into the world.  And yes, Jesus came to take the sins of the world upon his shoulders. We are told to care for land
@AOC You are so correct. Ms Sanders needs to read both Genesis and Leviticus in order to understand that God called the world "good" and that we are to respect the land.
Way to go, John Kelly! Give @realDonaldTrump a good swift kick in the ass when it comes to end this government #shutdown. I know it is #NationalComplimentDay, but Trump needs to understand that he is causing real national security risk to our country. https://t.co/OZBWWqoWGc

@zczack2 @funder Trump has now agreed to postpone his #SOTU until the #shutdown has ended. By tweeting the information about Pelosi's trip, he put her life in jeopardy; since 9/11, The President, Vice President and Speaker of the House have traveled on military craft into a war zone for safety
@TheRealTD1 If you are talking about Speaker Pelosi, I doubt anyone in the House Democrats would vote to remove her. Remember, #GOP ain't in control anymore. Get over it. If Trump goes to the House next week and the government is not reopen, the House Chamber will be dark, doors closed.
@cwimmler @MarshallJolly You are so correct. Strong ethics do start at home. I can only thank my parents that they taught me strong ethics. Question before us now: now do we break the cycle of "white male privilege"? Don't have a good answer to it.
@TheRealTD1 She's in charge of the House of Representatives at the current moment. She invites the president to the House to give the #SOTU. All speakers of the House are in charge one way or the other; the only way to keep order in the House.
Take the hint @realDonaldTrump, Speaker Pelosi WILL not allow you to give your #SOTU  in the House Chamber. She is in charge! Paul Ryan is not in charge anymore. #OpenTheGovernment without strings attached and you might get to give your #SOTU next week. https://t.co/Byg86LM3u1
@RepSwalwell That #psychopath president had better take a hint that Speaker Pelosi will not allow him to come to the House Chamber to give his #SOTU. I applaud Speaker Pelosi and her remarks to Trump.
The #TrumpCrimeFamily and most especially Lara Trump will never be in touch with reality. This family will never understand that missing checks will put your credit in jeopardy of going down the toilet. you lose your home, car, health. Our country should not be held hostage. https://t.co/stM9QcN875
Painting a "bowling alley because the wind was blowing fumes into their ostrich pen" is nothing like the fucking hell that these federal workers are going through with this #TrumpShutdown. This bitch has ZERO clue what this shutdown does to people who are not millionaires. https://t.co/8NwBMnb2IH
@TheRickyDavila I still can't believe that she actually would be that stupid (I think it runs in this crime family) to say this to federal workers. I do hope that she pay for their bills, food, and anything else that these 800,000 gov workers deserve from this Crime Family
Dear Lara Trump,	What gives you the fucking right to tell our furloughed workers to "suck it up" with this #Shutdown? We have bills to pay, food to get, medication to buy, rent/mortgages to pay. Why don't you and your family pay those bills for us?		Sincerely yours,	America https://t.co/fi7B1hGJxi
@adamcbest No wonder both she and Eric are such a good couple; they are both shit heads! They belong to the biggest shit family that doesn't give a damn about people as the #TrumpCrimeFamily ONLY cares about THEMSELVES!
@Katwoman0108 Can you try sending me private message again? I will see if I can get the messaging turned back on. I could use those financial sites you found to be helpful. Thanks
@Katwoman0108 @realDonaldTrump I am not doing better. Part of my SSD also goes to pay for my anti seizure medication, to see my neurologist every 6 months. I never earned enough to have an IRA or CDs. so in a sense, you are doing better than me.
@HillaryClinton @IndivisibleTeam I wish you had been elected President. You would not have put our country in danger like this #psychopath of a so called president. You would have kept us safe from people like Putin and you would not have shutdown the government for a vanity wall.
@funder Speaker Pelosi is one tough lady. One does not try to walk all over Speaker Pelosi. Trump had better learn that real quick. Speaker Pelosi has Trump right where it counts: HIS EGO! He needs to learn that Speaker Pelosi will never be bullied by ANYONE especially him.
I've called Sen Portman. got through to McTurtle's office! almost ripped one of his staff member's head with my anger over the shutdown. Now comes calling Sen Brown. #Resisters, call your SENATORS! https://t.co/aOsYPdskJK
Sounds like Trump is calling @SpeakerPelosi's bluff. It is up to her who speaks on the House floor. She is the one who is in charge. If Paul Ryan were in charge, Trump would be allowed even during a shutdown. Between those two speakers: who has the backbone to stand up to Trump? https://t.co/Mc714UePal
@Katwoman0108 @realDonaldTrump Have you ever thought of paying off student loans, rent, house hold bills and such? I LIVE on my Social Security Disability which is $1067.00 per month. My rent EATS it up! I am not allowed to work. I have to have food stamps just to buy my groceries. POTUS doesn't care!
@thomaskaplan @blakcoffee What about the Treasury? Will they be able to pay those who are on social security? social security disability? will they be able to get their checks in February?
@itsJeffTiedrich only one with a shithole president like our country. I worry about those who are on Social Security as well as those who are on Social Security Disability during this shutdown as well. Will they be able to buy food, pay their rent or mortgages and house hold bills?
Lara Trump, and her Crime Family, need to put their $ where their mouth is. THEY CAN PAY EACH furloughed workers rent, grocery bill, house hold bills, student loans, etc. That would ease these furloughed workers "pain" for awhile until this shutdown is over. https://t.co/wBJhJSqZYd
@realDonaldTrump You are nothing but a liar and a fake POTUS. You are a danger to our country. That is NOT #FakeNews. You want to be covered fairly, start TELLING the truth for once in your life. #OPENTHEGOVERNMENT as well!
Gee, the smallest (and I mean the very smallest) violin playing "poor baby" to these rich people not liking the plan to tax them. It's about time they pay more than what they have been paying in taxes. If we, in the middle class, pay our fair share then they can pay MORE! https://t.co/e94PEdIAD6

Does Lara Trump's comment of "Let them eat cake" remind you of Marie Antoinette's remark at the time of the French revolution in 1789? https://t.co/2byFNczlga
That is so true. The problem was Trump was able to "blindly" convince people that he was the "better" choice over any other candidate in the Republican party. He wasn't. Disaster struck for the #GOP when Trump was elected. The #GOP no longer represented the Lincoln Party. https://t.co/AdOWJPN0rk
Not surprised that Giuliani's fate, as Trump's lawyer, is uncertain now. The question remains now: who will step up to the plate and want to risk their law license for this #psychopath only to represent him now? I sure would not. https://t.co/bkFTYLgitp
WHY Trump's supporters don't see Trump as "the greatest threat of all" facing America is beyond ME.

Which is a shame. Makes this problem at Covington Catholic High School look even worse. Why would a priest just stand there watching his students openly mock a Native American veteran? Doesn't make any sense. And now the school intends to sue mainstream media? https://t.co/yTHwmxYr46
That prosecutor should look at the racism at that school before issuing that "dire" warning to the slew of liberal activists, celebrities, and journalists who a attacked the young high school students in the viral MAGA hat video. https://t.co/qQgmiw1Y2a
@MarshallJolly I am a cradle Episcopalian as I have been one for the last 52 years. Covington Catholic High School doesn't seem to have a reputation for "strong" ethics. Where is the teaching of respecting others? Where is the discipline for racism in their school? Both KY senators are racists
Don't forget Rand Paul! Both are racist and immoral. And yet they claim that they are Christians and uphold the teachings of Jesus Christ https://t.co/2BkgHUnmdu
It seems that this school just knows how to taunt people and not respect people.  These teens' parents want us to not "rush" to judgement on their teens' behavior in Washington DC; this picture says it all in their behavior toward minorities. Racism rules at Covington Catholic https://t.co/7j2FPNyK3A
@ArtemisionGreen @eclecticbrotha @CovCathColonels definitely not Christian Theology. Certainly not the teachings of Jesus Christ. I look forward to hearing what the principle says when he reads all the readings I think his students would benefit from. That should light a fire under his ass.
@ArtemisionGreen @eclecticbrotha @CovCathColonels That's what I am afraid of. Do their parents really care about their teens behavior? Somehow, I don't think so. I think some of this generation will be far better than these punks
@d1Vinman I don't either. I said that in a sarcastic way. I can't stand Ann Coulter so I was being sarcastic when I said something about "burning" her books. Sorry if it offended you. I didn't mean it.
@ArtemisionGreen @eclecticbrotha @CovCathColonels Thank you for this information. I suppose that I could write to the principle at that address as well. If a direct call will do the trick, I will do it. It is sad that the church is not teaching what Jesus Christ taught us. I guess this school's mentality is gone.
@Juni2424 which children? the ones in those cages in the TX desert? or the two who died in Border Security hands?
@Juni2424 I don't watch the Fox News crap because that is what is; CRAP!
@Juni2424 There is a difference between "hate" and "dislike". I don't hate Trump; I dislike him. What I hate are racism, bigotry and white supremacy -- all of which he and Pence have shown since 1/20/17.
@ONEnTWOnFREEDOM this kid learned hate and racism from parents and Trump. The veteran that this irresponsible jerk harassed was honoring other Native American veterans at Arlington National Cemetery. Hate is taught! This jerk only deserves my contempt.
We ought to burn all her books and see how she would like it; she would be screaming at the top of her lungs "Book burning! It's outdated!" She doesn't care about anything so long as it doesn't hurt her. Maybe she needs to move to Russia and marry Putin; two peas in a pod! https://t.co/yk4Txe9ehj
@realDonaldTrFan It is probably best that you don't. No one wants to hear you on a day that HONORS SOMEONE WHO DID NOT SUPPORT RACISM; SOMETHING YOU PROMOTE. You promote white supremacy as well. President Obama was a FAR BETTER PRESIDENT THAN YOU ARE. You are a chaotic president.

Ain't that the truth. When "MAGA" teens learn to HATE and DISRESPECT people, it becomes the greatest threat to human decency WITHIN our own borders! #CovingtonCatholicHighSchool says they are going to investigate this? BS! I hope, if they do, that those teens are expelled! https://t.co/cOCra67xMB
@realDonaldTrump doesn't realize that his stupidity with this #Shutdown will keep him in office in 2020. Nope; Democrats will win back the presidency and control of the #Senate. The #SenateGOP are traitors to the American people. They don't give a damn about those gov employees https://t.co/zrvG5VDJyO
@realDonaldTrump is upset that @SpeakerPelosi and Democrats won't accept his offer yesterday. He thinks he's gonna win in 2020; I don't think so! People are gonna remember this #shutdown and being out of work for a month! #OPENTHEGOVERMENT #TraitorTrump #ImpeachTheMF #Impeach https://t.co/5NqJTtsI6a
@realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi and Democrats are not doing to negotiate with a "gun" pointed at their heads! Why not #OPENTHEGOVERMENT and then have those negotiations? It would help. By they way, you will lose in 2020! The economy HAS TANKED because of your #shutdown. It has been a month!
Ahh... Treat her the way people treated some women during the Salem Witch Trials! That would be fun to see when it deals with Ann Coulter! I'd love to see if she is a witch or not! I would say that she is a witch! https://t.co/bFYqiQt0f3
@Klaatu00556955 I'll wait for Mueller's report. I won't wait for Trump. That orange moron does not deserve my "patience". He deserves my contempt!
@handyvision @UncededClothing I hope none of those MAGA white boys growing up to be another Bret Kavanaugh. Sends shivers down my spine in fear.
@HamillHimself @1IronMan2020 What else is new? He misspells words all the time lately. #DidTrumpOpenGovernmentYet
AMEN TO THAT! HATE IS TAUGHT! Kids learn HATE and BIGOTRY, in this country, 	from a president	from a school	from a family	SHAME ON THE PRESIDENT, SCHOOL AND THESE FAMILIES WHO TEACH HATE AND BIGOTRY! https://t.co/RLLH6A651j
Sen Collins sure is worried that she will lose her reelection! She's not worried about the American people. Spineless bitch. When she says that a shutdown should never be used as a weapon to achieve an outcome and then "supports" Trump/McTrurle that tells me she's A #GOP COWARD! https://t.co/x5JFdOMCu8
I heard that @realDonaldTrump failed to mention any kind of sympathy for the hundreds of thousands of federal workers who face so much uncertainty and chaos because of the shutdown. Shame on @realDonaldTrump  #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/8sDBXkZIjx
@thomaskaine5 trump is scaring the crap out of me as well. I think he is both evil and crazy. I agree that God only knows what he may try doing as impeachment time approaches. This is worse than Watergate. so it is not just you that feels this way. I feel the same way.
While I never went to a Catholic school, my mother taught at one. I was raised to respect EVERYONE. These teens who were harassing a Native American Vietnam Veteran have NO clue what it means to SERVE YOUR COUNTRY. Their behavior is UNACCEPTABLE! https://t.co/xImswaniHu
YEP! The MAGA hat stands for HATE just like the white hood did. The HATRED in OUR NATION IS DISGUSTING! That MAGA hat has no place in our generation just like the white hood. https://t.co/eGS7pto7mt
I can imagine where these kids learned that disgusting vile behavior: their parents, right-wing GOP and TRUMP! TRUMP never served in the military; this Native American is a Vietnam War veteran who's honoring other Native American veterans buried at Arlington National Cemetary. https://t.co/RQzbX3JU0r
@PassTheSalty thank you for the summary. Medieval Wall ain't gonna work anyway. Only better technology, more border agents, and drones would work at our borders. Does anyone really think Trump is going to "protect" those Dreamers? I sort of doubt it. I doubt that the #GOPTraitors would do it.
@SpeakerPelosi knows where to hit Trump right where it counts: HIS EGO! The woman has GOT CLAWS and she dug into that EGO of his. Congress can't make a deal with that moron with a gun pointed at their head while this #Shutdown is happening. #EndTheShutdown and then #negotiate! https://t.co/9e8GBld3s7
That is so true. He is so brave to stand up to these children. I do call him a "WARRIOR". https://t.co/tQQBlnWP4m
@KellyannePolls I think what said is "If the Buzzfeed article is true, he should resign. If he doesn't resign then he should be impeached". #buzzfeed article is a "not sure" if it is true or not. Why don't you think people said "If it is true"? I don't think any of the Media should say "sorry"
CAN HIS POLL approval rating get any LOWER? 38% is good low #, but I would like to see it go even LOWER! ##DidTrumpOpenGovernmentYet https://t.co/ULs94xpfUM
"Wonderful" role models these parents and right-wing &amp; #GOP are to these high school teens. These people teach these high school teens hate and that is it okay to mock and intimidate Native Americans. Makes me sick. Those parents, right-wing and #GOP are to BLAME! THE SCHOOL TOO https://t.co/AhZ7pgekfV
A Native American, Nathan Phillips, who is a Vietnam War veteran gets harassed by kids from Covington Catholic School. Gee, are these stupid students even going to sign up for the military? At least Nathan Phillips is a veteran of an awful war and remembered others at Arlington https://t.co/HReCASyAmP
@davidhogg111 I think the best orator of the past 100 years was FDR. He was able to keep people calm during the Great Depression and then during World War II up to his death. I am sure that my parents would say the same. The next would be his wife Eleanore.
#GOP rats in the #Senate have to get off their high horse and begin to vote in the #Senate. Mr. Trump, #OpenTheGovernment and then negotiate with Democrats. You don't negotiate during a #Shutdown. Trump needs to stop screwing around and work with Democrats NOW! #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/HD5q9DbckU
I have a feeling that until we get rid of this hate, we will always see this kind of harassment. This was their land; their culture. White people invaded; slaughtered; conquered and enslaved. Covington Catholic seems to teach hate. A Catholic school is teaching hate? Ain't good. https://t.co/ccHcmPpnxp
I hope that Covington Catholic school is not teaching "institutionalized hate". If they are, I wonder why they even call themselves "Catholic". Harassing a Native American is not what the teachings of Jesus Christ taught us. He taught us to be respectful of all people. https://t.co/i65IWypFpg
Dear @realDonaldTrump,	If you have the "ultimate loyalty to the American people," then please #EndTheShutdown. You would not request $ for a Medieval wall that won't work. What will work is better technology, more border agents, and drones. Work with the Democrats!	America https://t.co/FUD3ZAgu9M
Cher's words ring true! Women are loud and proud! Men can't pat our heads and say "Good Girls" anymore. Women have fought battles since the late 1800s for the right to vote, we still continue 2 fight men especially 4 our independence! I respect every word that Cher wrote! https://t.co/3adxBIhPWs
I am glad that I didn't hear @realDonaldTrump's announcement. Temporary DACA for the border wall? You have got to be kidding? Can't believe that Jared and Pence were the ones who worked on this. Then again anything with this administration is not surprising. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/VXqqz56sra
@ceci_wallace @Lee_in_Iowa @thomaskaine5 @realDonaldTrump Not only did I read my book on Mary Queen of Scots, but I did watch a movie. I didn't want to watch that pathological liar talk on tv today. I bet you watched that pathological liar tell the American people a ton of lies today.  #TraitorTrump
@ceci_wallace @Lee_in_Iowa @thomaskaine5 @realDonaldTrump I don't like books that deal with gore. I like history. So I will pick up the one I am currently reading about Mary, Queen of Scots (a distant relative)
@SenSanders @nancy_kerschner President Trump is not "better at the military".. He is the worst person when it comes to treating the military with disgust. He is hurting 42,000 service members without paychecks which tells me that he doesn't care about anyone but himself. How can you say what he said?
Me too! I will be watching a movie or reading a good book! Why should I listen to Trump's pathological lies at 3pm? I sure don't want to throw up my lunch. Fuck Trump!!!!! https://t.co/v4tCGogLUB
@realDonaldTrump It will be easier if you use the money you want for your Medieval wall to hire more people to be Border agents. We need better technology, drones and more border agents to help stop the flow of drugs and illegal migrants. People will dig tunnels under your Medieval wall.
@kenolin1 Dear Mr Vice President Pence,	The school and your wife's desire to work there do not reflect the values of Jesus Christ. Jesus ACCEPTED EVERYONE! You and your wife, not to mention this school, are bigoted and ignorant. It is appalling and disgusting.	Sincerely,	America
I can't wait to hear Michael Cohen testify that #Trump's relationship with #Russia goes back 30 years ago. @realDonaldTrump should never have run for president. He doesn't deserve to be president and neither does Pence. They are hypocrites, racists, bigots. #ImpeachTrumpPence https://t.co/MIsbDWnhyB
Did ICE think that this client's prosthetic leg and arm were filled with drugs? ICE is getting rather stupid especially when someone has a prosthetic leg and arm. They don't care if they are committing crimes against humanity. #MarchForDigity of all persons! https://t.co/BNmBtgjN16
Dear Mr Vice President Pence and Second Lady Pence,	I suggest, since you say that you are Pro-Life, that you visit the children housed in those cages along the Southern border and march for THEIR LIVES. They deserve respect as well. They are humans not animals.		America https://t.co/UPsP0hJwVD
and I am sure we will keep marching until Trump is out of office not to mention Pence. https://t.co/0I6KlNhus8
If Mom were alive today, she and I would be in Washington DC marching in the Women's March. She would have done that two years ago. I know she would not have like Trump. I respected her advocacy for women. I respect those who are not marching today. https://t.co/HVJjlLn3v2
Charles I of England is the only British monarch to have the dubious honor to be the ONLY monarch to be beheaded. Both he and his grandmother, Mary Queen of Scots, were tragic figures in the Stuart Dynasty in Britain. https://t.co/GP1eWrXImC

I look forward to hearing Michael Cohen testify on Feb 7th. It will be interesting to see how much of that Buzzfeed story is correct. I just heard @realDonaldTrump  say that the article in Buzzfeed was a "disgrace to the country". That guy is full of crap. https://t.co/sYFdhUtkkS
Dear @realDonaldTrump,	There is not an emergency. No wall along the Southern border is going to keep drugs and migrants out of the United States. What will help is using that money to hire more people for border security, tech firms to develop better technology to keep drugs out https://t.co/13pS9B7oaO
@realDonaldTrump ain't gonna be celebrating when he and Pence are #Impeached.  Wait until he AND Pence hear about those damning reports about @realDonaldTrump and his crimes. I am sure that Mueller has some stuff on Pence as well. So much for celebrating with the administration https://t.co/AW5qoOxnq6

Thank God I will not be watching Trump's speech today. I think I would be throwing up my breakfast and lunch. It is time for that #pathological liar to realize that racist wall ain't gonna work! Better technology and hiring more border security will help more than a racist wall. https://t.co/438OFzoshl
@realDonaldTrump Why don't you use the money you want for that medieval wall by creating more American jobs at be border and hiring tech firms to help create better technology that will help stop the flow of drugs and migrants from entering at our ports of entry? That would be a better use of $.
That is a great idea. Use that money that @realDonaldTrump wants for his medieval wall and create more American jobs by hiring more border agents, tech firms that will help to create better technology to prevent drugs and migrants from being smuggled through legal points of entry https://t.co/EcnwehNMMC
@thomaskaine5 I think you are correct. I hope that many people will stop watching trump on tv. I am sick of Trump broadcasting his ignorant and pathological propaganda that we know are all lies! I am sick of seeing and hearing Trump.
@realDonaldTrump Mainstream Media have more CREDIBILITY than that of FOX News. At least Mainstream Media does not support a pathological liar like you. You are a disgrace to the office of the President. You are UNFIT TO BE PRESIDENT! ONLY HILLARY CLINTON IS FIT TO BE PRESIDENT. #TraitorTrump
I would love to know how many ignorant Trump supporters are taking homeless American veterans into their homes. I doubt we would even get an answer to that question only because they would be saying "none". Our homeless American veterans deserve our respect for what they did. https://t.co/HEJ38r8enm
God help us if we get VP Mike Pence as president once Trump goes to prison. #TraitorPence and his crayon coloring wife @SecondLady  Karen Pence cannot take over! Evangelical Taliban! Ignorant, plague! WORSE THAN TRUMP! #PresidentPelosi  #ImpeachPence Send Pence to PRISON! https://t.co/iBGieSxmUW

@alchemist_truth Baloney. Look at what the white people did in the 1600s to Africans by putting them into slavery until they were freed under the 13th Amendment. You may say that Christians don't teach that. Why do we still have racism and bigotry? #ExposeChristianSchools
@ittybittyboobah Look, if you have a "Slave Day" it looks like a Christian School is saying it is okay to treat people the way we treated Africans in the 1600s before they were freed under the 13th Amendment. If you can't deal with my last statement that is your problem. 	#ExposeChristianSchools
One would think that even in a Bible College would report rapes on campus. That is supposed to happen regardless if it is a Christian school or not. Police have to know that rapes are happening on campus. #ExposeChristianSchools https://t.co/FXjFXD3XVp
Did this "outside security" patrol the campus to make sure there were no sexual assaults on campus? Sounds like it was just in the city and not on campus. I hope that outside security patrol would make sure that the campus was safe from sexual assaults. #ExposeChristianSchools https://t.co/maztfvoW5f
I thought schools were suppose to take something like that seriously. Why wait hours to get help for an overdose after "attempting a faith healing"? That school should have been held responsible for that girl's death. #ExposeChristianSchools https://t.co/NXgm4zhOOD
I wonder if that christian ethics teacher would day if that student had be sexually abused (raped) prior to marriage? Would she still say that student was like that "unwrapped peppermint"? Probably. #ExposeChristianSchools https://t.co/RumU1Fwi74
Talk about a principle not following procedure of notifying the police about a child being physically &amp; sexually abused. That is supposed to be reported after a child tells someone. #ExposeChristianSchools https://t.co/GPPznUxnZN
Sounds like an evangelical school believed in the Old Testament and in Exodus. "Slave Day" is appalling since that looks at how the Egyptians treated the Jews prior to their escape to the Promised Land. #ExposeChristianSchools https://t.co/nVTJWAVI8r
I believe that anyone who are teaching in "Christian Schools" should be licensed teachers. Evangelicals teach that non-whites are marked with a curse (Ham) rather than look at the teachings of Jesus; Jesus welcomes everyone;he does not look at skin color. #ExposeChristianSchools https://t.co/kmHWRLLEas
that is so very true. Religion needs to be kept out of schools and government. We have too many different religions and we can't force someone to repeat the "Lords Prayer" in school. We do determine our destiny. #ExposeChristianSchools https://t.co/BCo3OG1kDC
@sheila79704321 @senrobportman I went with a delegation of of my church. I was appalled at what I saw. You would leave your child in an area where there is more danger than on a journey where there was hope for asylum? I doubt your religion even works since you sure don't have a "I care bone" for these kids.
@sheila79704321 @senrobportman So sorry that it is an "unfair" statement. Hey, life is life. You want to march for life, then march for those separated children's lives -- the children who are STILL HELD IN CAGES AT THE BORDER! That would be the Christian thing to do.
President George W Bush doesn't need to worry about being "known" as the worst president in modern history behind Nixon. The one who can top Nixon is @realDonaldTrump as he is the WORST PRESIDENT in modern history! Nixon follows and then George W Bush. #ImpeachTheMF https://t.co/wscz55JHsM
Bush 43 shows what "acting" Presidential is like. To pay for a deliver pizzas to Secret Service workers and other federal employees is something that Trump could take a cue from. I think 43 could end this shutdown in a split second! https://t.co/95axnj9boF
This is what I would expect from Former President George W Bush. I know that Bush 41 would be pleased. Both 41 and 43 live by their Christian beliefs. "Do unto others as thou would do unto you" is something that can be seen when you see 43 deliver pizza to federal workers. https://t.co/630uZfZtE6
@senrobportman Do me a favor, I wish the GOP and the so called "Pro Life" people would get their nose out of the healthcare decisions made by a woman and her doctor. What mystifies me is why the GOP allows Trump tear children apart from their parents and put them in cages; March for their life!
The worst part is @realDonaldTrump put @SpeakerPelosi's and the rest of the Congressional staff's safety in danger with his leaking their trip schedule when he denied @SpeakerPelosi a military plane.Wastes $ on trophy wife, Pompeo &amp; wife + Linda Graham with military planes. https://t.co/zc6hGI3P5Y
@SenBlumenthal @BubblegumGram Please make it public. I would like to hear him explain why he lied to the Senate Judiciary committee in the first place. I am sure that America would like to hear from his mouth why he lied. Perjury is a crime! If he lied before the Senate Judiciary Committee, that's even worse
@EdKrassen I am with you! That is exactly what "Pro-Life"  means! We need to stand up to enemies who kill our journalists; keeping children with their families &amp; not tearing them apart; protecting lives from gun violence.
@goodoldcatchy That is true. Democrats have been trying to get cash out of politics since the United States Supreme Court voted for Citizens United. That meant that you could put a ton of $ into a campaign. Media has to improve. We have to get rid of the rats in the GOP right now.
I hope that includes the governor. He sure did not give a damn about the people of Flint, MI. https://t.co/MT9fa4RAUd
Time for Nielsen to resign from her post. How she can say that "we have never had a policy for family separation" is a crock of shit.

@mmpadellan @Twitter I agree. Inviting people to "send a brick" to Nancy Pelosi is a clear-cut incitement to VIOLENCE. It is that kind of tweeting that should not be allowed on Twitter. Please, Twitter, suspend that users account.
Glad to see the #PresidentPelosi trending &amp; the #Traitor in the White House is not happy about it. Here's the smallest violin for that traitor.

@ChiNewsBench She was going to "thank" our troops for what they are doing in Afghanistan. The same thing that @realDonaldTrump did when he went to Iraq to visit the troops there. Besides after 9/11, the President, VP, and speaker of the house travel on military aircraft if they go into warzone
@DBLJ06030101 @SenFeinstein I told you that before a fetus is BORN is a fetus. Once born, it a baby.

Only that woman and her doctor do.
@dc2mk2 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr @realDonaldTrump Look, with a medieval wall along the Southern border, people from Mexico and Latin America can STILL come into America by DIGGING tunnels under the racist wall OR climb OVER the wall.

We went backwards once @realDonaldTrump announced his intent to run for president; won the nomination and then the election. His base believed his outrageous lies and yet a draft dodger gets elected.

We, as a nation, have to get a grip on the lawlessness of this presidency and right now!

@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Just remember, you have lied to the American people especially when you said that you didn't have any properties in Russia. Guess what; you have the #TrumpTowerMoscow and now you are denying it like you always do. I predict that this year is not going to be your year.
Amen! #ImpeachTrumpPence now! Both are traitors to the United States! I can't wait to see Trump #impeached. The #SOCIOPATHS can't govern!

#corruption at the highest level! this is an #AbuseOfPower from @realDonaldTrump. Letting his trophy wife take a military 757 and yet cancels @SpeakerPelosi's trip to a war zone on that same type of military plane is stupid! #ImpeachTrump https://t.co/uGx9qAKrHy
This is an abuse of power. If anything, @SpeakerPelosi needed that government plane to visit troops in Afghanistan. Melania Trump could have taken a "commercial" flight to Mar-a-Lago. #CORRUPTION #AbuseOfPower #ImpeachTrump https://t.co/4KcENmbcB0
I agree! While I would like to have the Mueller report be in the hands of congress before there the Articles of Impeachment are drawn, it is time for Articles of Impeachmet! #IMPEACHDONALDTRUMP #ImpeachTheMF https://t.co/XEInsknaOa
Lord only knows where his presidential library is going to be. I don't think we should even include the Bible in it. The others would be a good idea. Of course, he can't even make a deal to reopen the government! so much for the "Dealmaker". https://t.co/WYzlfDr34V
The poor baby. Why doesn't she ask Gabby Gifford what it was like to the target of a crazed assin back in 2011 when she was shot in Tuson and others where either killed and injured? Curella de Vil of Education is not in that much pain as Gabby Gifford was. https://t.co/9uec4cqti1
@realDonaldTrump A midieval wall won't stop people from coming to America. They can tunnel underneath a wall. They can climb over the wall. A wall ain't gonna work! Can't you get that through your think skull?
I hope he Barr drops his monination as AG given his comments this week admitting that it would be a crime if the president tried to "coach someone to testify falsely." If he doesn't, I hope he has a backbone to stand up to Trump and not accept Trump's bullying. https://t.co/2d0md9Y1jr
Why do I think this is going to put the #TrumpCrimeFamily into more trouble than they already are? It is amazing just how much shit Special Counsel Mueller is learning about @realDonaldTrump and his dealings with #Russia. Trump is a #RussianAsset. There is no doubt about it. https://t.co/zrrMyWt6gR
@dc2mk2 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr @realDonaldTrump THE MEDIEVAL WALL WILL NOT STOP DRUGS COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY. DRUGS COME INTO OUR COUNTRY THROUGH OUR PORTS OF ENTRY. Get that through your head! You are just as much of a racist as @realDonaldTrump with your wanting a medieval wall.
@DBLJ06030101 @SenFeinstein Have you EVER READ ROE V WADE? AS A PARALEGAL, I HAVE! What you believe in is putting the like of a woman in DANGER if her pregnacy has COMLICATIONS! By the way, before that fetuse is born, it is a fetus, there are TOO MANY ORPHANS IN ORPHANGES THAT ARE NEVER ADOPTED. ADOPT ONE.
@DBLJ06030101 @SenFeinstein Get out of the decisions made by a woman and her doctor. It has nothing to do with "killing babies". There's MORE to women's health. Democrats agree to border security, just NOT A MEDIEVAL WALL. That won't help. If McConnell would bring the House bills for a vote it would end.
AMEN! That is exactly what the Republicans are. No longer the Party of Family Values or the Party of Christianity. They are the Party of Criminals; Party of Scumbags; Party of Traitors; Party of Putin. I am not sure if I can come up with any other names. Other ideas? https://t.co/e7DJhHFE2u
Trump will never understand how the government works &amp; what the term "checks &amp; balances" mean. Even if the GOP did explain it to him, I doubt he would ever understand it. His vanity and ego has also led us to this shutdown. NO SPTU ADDRESS. OPEN GOVERNMENT! WAY TO GO PELOSI! https://t.co/cGaWqk1U0n
I agree! Please, Mrs. Obama, run for President! You would make a wonderful president. Happy Birthday! https://t.co/HnBdhJ8kyk
And Bill Clinton's impeachment was all political as well! Lying about a blow job is nothing compared to the mounting evidence that is against Trump. Hopefully, the #GOPComplicit will realize that Trump is unfit to serve as president and remove him. #ImpeachTheMF https://t.co/2czrE0z5uI
Wake up, #GOPComplicitTraitors! The evidence is right in front of your fucking eyes! Don't ignore it anymore. You can't let @realDonaldTrump run this country into a third world  which is what he is doing with this #TrumpShutdown. Do your fucking jobs! You work for us not Trump. https://t.co/m3dOsuU6tK
This is ONE time I don't have "thoughts and prayers" for someone. KARMA is a bitch, isn't it, Betsy DeVos? I don't give a fucking damn about Cruella de Vil of Public School Education. She's the worst Secretary of Education in our nation's history! https://t.co/oPI2mqTGdy
I can't wait to see if @SpeakerPelosi starts impeachment proceedings. What I really can't wait for is the Mueller report. With Giuliani's stupid remarks yesterday, I can see that going into Mueller's report and impeachment proceedings beginning. Trump won't know what hit him. https://t.co/pAJg3ATXmi
I love #SpeakerPelosi! I love how she has Trump backed into the corner; if you look at Trump, you can see that #SpeakerPelosi has taken whatever little manhood he had left. I doubt he will ever miss it. God love #SpeakerPelosi! She is one badass lady! https://t.co/rwEgOI8ry2
DHS Secretary Nielsen NEEDS to resign from her post NOW! I am with @SenatorDurbin https://t.co/d3f3XdUdaz
@SenFeinstein I don't understand why Senate Republican leaders are more concerned about attacking women's health, rather than reopening the government. Maybe those Senate Republican leaders ought to pay those furloughed federal workers out of their own salaries.
while I wish he could receive the highest penalty for #treason, having @realDonaldTrump spend the rest of his life in jail would be fine. Just another way to tell future presidents to not do what this #treasonousjackass has done. https://t.co/cBZrqUz7yh

Nope. #EndTheShutdownNow  #TREASONWeasels #GOPComplicitTraitors #GOPrats https://t.co/jh6boVHOSy
@SenSchumer @senatemajldr @realDonaldTrump I sort of doubt that @senatemajldr and @realDonaldTrump will listen to the American people when it comes to putting an end to the shutdown. I want to see an end to the shutdown. They are putting our nation at risk of danger and they don't care. All about pride and ego.
Yes, the GOP IS FILLED WITH RACISTS! It will be years BEFORE we can weed out all those racist rats in the #GOP beginning with @senatemajldr and anyone in the House.

@SpeakerPelosi's intent to visit our troops in Afghanistan must be applauded! Did we see Paul Ryan do that when he was speaker? I don't think so. It is shameful that @realDonaldTrump isn't allowing her to go on military aircraft to visit our troops to thank them. All politics! https://t.co/ZmhW8UyA5h
@NPCman043 @realDonaldTrump I am not insecure at how I look. I bet you look like a mutt! Melania is a slut! I am secured in how I look. I don't have to put up pictures of me if I don't want to; that is my right.
And I can't wait to see those indictments fall into @realDonaldTrump's lap. I can't wait to see the look on @realDonaldTrump's face when those indictments begin to fall into his lap. Should be an interesting look! https://t.co/UTFXAXnJgG

@realDonaldTrump OPEN THE DAMN GOVERNMENT! #GOPComplicitTraitors  which includes those in the Senate, House and you. You DON'T CARE ABOUT AMERICANS. You NO longer care about America. You only care about yourself.
@senatemajldr - this shutdown is now on your shoulders. It is your responsibility to reopen the government. You are worse than Roy Moore. I see you losing your reelection next year because of this shutdown. You are intentionally hurting Americans AND the economy. #GOPTraitors https://t.co/4iR9zZNQGC

@realDonaldTrump what is so funny now is that the FBI is investigating you to see if you are indeed a #RussianAsset.  James Comey should have been investigating you once you asked Russia to get those Hillary Clinton emails.
I just about fell off my couch when I heard Giuliani say "I never said there was no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia". It is like he is telling people Trump did collude with Russia.

@ChuckGrassley Dear Sen Grassley,	Sen McConnell will not bring any House bill to the Senate floor for a vote. Have you seen any of these government employees and talked with them about their struggles with their bills? I bet you haven't.Our national security is at risk! #GOPTraitors
@dexter_zee @realDonaldTrump @SteveDaines Dems are interested in REOPENING the government. It is McConnell and Trump that are not. They haven't seen the # of people who are struggling to pay bills. they have to decide which bill to pay. It could end IF McConnell would bring those House bills to the Senate for a vote.

McTurtle SHOULD take his pay and give it to those who are not getting paid. Why should HE get paid when these 800,000 government employees are struggling to pay bills?

I HOPE this gets McTurtle to get off his ass and brings any House bill to the Senate floor for a vote. I am sick and tired of McTurtle putting his re-election BEFORE the 800,000 gov employees who are NOT getting paid for their services. THAT IS VIOLATING THE 13TH AMENDMENT https://t.co/KDaZ79Q41d

@ChuckGrassley Sen. Grassley, please do not be blinded by what you "think" the Trump administration is trying to do. He refuses to listen to any ideas coming from Pelosi. Border barriers are going to help; people can tunnel underneath the barriers! #GOP do not understand that! #EndTheShutdown
@senrobportman I hope you do, Sen. Portman. However; even with physical barriers, people can STILL tunnel underneath them! Please convey that to the President and to Sen. McConnell. That would help to get this shutdown to end. I agree with better border security including the use of drones.
@Tmurdock6995 You don't tell the American people the "we have defeated ISIS" when we have not defeated ISIS.  Why not put the blame of being in the Middle East in the first place on Bush 43 in the first place? He sent our troops to the Middle East back in the early 2000s and ISIS began!
@shomaristone That was the best idea. Until the #GovernmentShutdown has ended, Trump should reschedule his State of the Union Address. What he should do right now is end this #shutdown NOW.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Dear @DonaldJTrumpJr,	Heaven DOES NOT have a wall. God calls everyone HIS CHILDREN. Obviously, you have not read the New Testament and have acted on the teachings of Jesus Christ. If you believe in thse teachings , you would  "do unto others as thou would  do unto you".

@Jim_Jordan @BlueSade7 Besides being a disgrace to my own father's name, you are a disgrace to Ohio. Democrats have come to the President with ideas to help reopen the government. He chose not to listen. It takes 2 to compromise. McConnell won't bring ANY House bill to the Senate floor for a vote.
I am positive that our allies would break out in song and dance that the Trump era had ended the day after he leaves office! I can see the streets here in the United States being filled with people breaking out in song and dance as well! Can you see the headlines? https://t.co/tZmWlZF7Zd
@funder @BIGLOBBY @senatemajldr Dear Sen McConnell,	The government would reopen if you held a vote. You refuse to do so. That is unacceptable. You are Trump's lapdog. Stop holding American hostage. You're a traitor. #MitchOpenTheDamnGovt  #MitchShutdown
Trump lied when he told the American public that ISIS had been defeated so that was the reason why he was pulling troops from Syria. Well, now we have had a suicide attack claimed by ISIS AND multiple U.S. troops have reportedly been killed in Syria. His lies have consequences. https://t.co/TdTlZG7Fwj
McConnell's refusal to operate independently of Trump should disqualify him from his position of Senate Majority Leader. He is putting his own re-election ahead of 800,000 working people. People who have bills to pay, food to put on the table, and other basic needs, https://t.co/KMs0ZlIz8v
@AOC @l800mph I believe that Sen. McConnell should operate independently of Trump. He needs to put the 800,000 working people ahead of his re-election. Those people have bills to pay, food to put on the table, clothes to buy and other basic needs. His re-election can sit on the back burner.
Ann Coulter was not elected president. She should not be telling @realDonaldTrump how to govern. If Trump doesn't build the wall, I will be happy that he will be "dead in the water" as it will mean that he will be a one term president. A Democrat becomes POTUS! https://t.co/2XgBiQ3l0s
@funder Republicans have been traitors for the longest time. It especially began in 2010 when they won back control of both houses of Congress. Now the only hold control of the Senate. McConnell is as complicit of this shutdown as Trump. His pay out to be diverted to those 800,000 worker
Way to go Chuck Schumer! You should be Senate Majority Leader! If you were Senate Majority Leader now, we would have had those House bills brought to the Senate floor for a vote. Come 2020, the Democrats HAVE to RETAKE CONTROL OF THE SENATE! https://t.co/oeKccSyLJh
I agree that Barr must recuse himself. By doing that, he will run the risk of being attacked by @realDonaldTrump just like Sessions had been attacked. Will his statement of "not being bullied by anyone including the president" actually be believable? Only time will tell. https://t.co/xpQLsgDgQj
I was not in favor of the firing of James Comey prior to his firing. The only reason he was fired was because James Comey would not prosecute Hillary Clinton.

@EdKrassen I like the word "Christians" being put into quotation marks. These people don't know their Christian values. Children &amp; vet without shoes, sick people without healthcare, a city without drinking water, migrants fleeing from certain death need the help from Christians!
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump What @realDonaldTrump doesn't understand is that people escaping from their countries for the United States CAN dig tunnels under a wall and still enter our country illegally. a wall won't help.

AND the worst part of this shutdown: USING our federal employees as PAWNS!!! These people have bills to pay, food to put on the table. It's affecting businesses. Travelers lives are in danger. trump and McTrurle have to start to budge to reopen the government. https://t.co/E1at5jJGK3
@realDonaldTrump You refuse ANYTHING that the Democrats bring before you. In case you don't know this, people from Mexico WILL be able to DIG tunnels UNDER your precious wall. You don't think about things like that. Use the money for better border security and NOT a useless wall. YOU are RACIST!!
@NPCman043 @realDonaldTrump Michell and Barack Obama are not "Michael and Barry Obama". It's people like you who like to make things up. These people are not gay. You and your cronies listen to too much Fox and their shit which untruths. Trump: NOT CHRISTIAN.

Then EVERY GOP SENATOR can FORFEIT THEIR PAY and GIVE IT TO THE 800,000 GOV EMPLOYEES! If McTurtle and the Senate GOP just want to sit on their ass and do nothing, THEY CAN PAY EACH 800,000 GOV EMPLOYEE OUT OF THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT SALARIES WE PAY FOR THEM TO BE WORK FOR US. https://t.co/zVW2dEqKfo
@RepSchneider Please find a way to help end this shutdown. It is a nightmare for all Americans, but especially those 800,000 government employees who are not being paid. Talk with Sen. McConnell and get him to bring the House bills to the Senate floor for a vote. #EndTheShutdown PLEASE!
Probably what he wants with this shutdown. then he can blame the Democrats when we all know it was TRUMP'S FAULT ONLY!!!!! It is a nightmare for all of us. Can any of you say "retreat"? I know I can. https://t.co/w8rACYNGPc
@senatemajldr PROBABLY because you constantly REFUSE to bring any House Bill to the Senate floor for a vote. Do your job and bring those bills to the Senate floor for a vote. That will help get this shutdown to end. Might also help to get your other "important" legislation to move forward.
@NPCman043 @realDonaldTrump He hasn't done SHIT for this country. He's polarized this country; filled it with HATE, BIGOTRY, RACISM. He shuts down the gov all for that precious wall and FORGETS that drugs are smuggled into the country AT OUR PORTS OF ENTRY. He SOLD OUR COUNTRY TO PUTIN! AND LIES ABOUT IT!
@NPCman043 @realDonaldTrump Michelle Obama HAS FAR MORE GRACE than the so called first lady. At least Michelle didn't have a WHOLE house full of BLOOD RED Christmas trees when SHE WAS FIRST LADY. Melania is NOT a beautiful woman. She's a slut.
@djmintman @realDonaldTrump Oh, I understood. I am a paralegal. I know that a federal judge's rulings can be affirmed or over turned by the Supreme Court.  And Please, don't throw out that maga crap at me. Trump hasn't done shit for this country. He's bankrupting it like his own businesses!
@NPCman043 @realDonaldTrump migration which is something that BOTH are against. Trump and his trophy wife are hypocrites. They do not belong in the White House. They are a disgrace!!!!!
@NPCman043 @realDonaldTrump In all my years of living &amp; voting, I have never been asked a "citizenship" question on a Census. Why the sudden interest in "citizenship" questions anyway? Could it be that Trump is not an American citizen? His trophy wife got Trump to get her parents "citizenship" by chain
@sueperkins This sounds like what history will say about Trump. Currently, Trump is holding 800,000 government employees paychecks hostage with this shutdown. It is costing millions of American dollars and risking American lives. Are May and Trump cut from the same cloth? They waste money!
I was glad I was sitting down when I heard that her deal was crushed by Parliament by that many votes. I wish she would resign. From what I heard, the UK will exit the EU which I think is a big mistake. I think Putin wants to crush Europe and America. This is what scares me. https://t.co/9K0y2y3Rck
I am beginning to have a "little" empathy to Mulvany. To be blamed for something that is not his fault is stupid; this is #TrumpsShutdown which he started before Christmas 2018. Trump has to take responsibility for this shutdown! https://t.co/Tjds3lGdJb

@SpeakerPelosi is correct when she tells Trump to stop holding the paychecks of 800,000 Americans hostage.

@senatemajldr Do something about ending this shutdown! It is your responsibility to get this shutdown to come to an end. Don't blame Democrats. It is YOU that won't allow bills to come to the Senate floor for a vote. You took an OATH to uphold the Constitution NOT to be loyal to Trump.
The GOP has never been able to balance a budget! I last time we even had a surplus was with President Clinton! When Bush 43 took over, our deficit shot up! It has ballooned under this fake president. Maybe the Mueller probe can recoup $ for the government by taking $ from Trump! https://t.co/UfoJb9s4ik
WITH that approval rating, Trump should  reopen our government. My thinking is he wants to see his approval rating sink even lower! This is so pathetic! How many gov employees have to go to food pantry's, find other places to work until this shutdown is over? A travesty! https://t.co/cZmHY38vmf
I was glad that Barr said he would not be bullied by anyone and that would include Trump. My jaw almost hit the floor when I heard this. I hope that if Barr is confirmed that he won't be bullied by anyone especially by Trump. Trump needs to be HELD ACCOUNTABLE for his ACTIONS! https://t.co/6MiEUg7qNU
I am glad I am sitting on my couch watching this. When I heard Barr say "it would be a crime" if Trump intervened in a case in which he has a personal interest that is a constitutional violation! I wonder if Trump knows what Barr is saying about that? Fell off the chair? Maybe. https://t.co/vTB5i8xLew
@B52Malmet this comment was the best comment I heard in the first part of the hearings. Never thought I would enjoy hearing a hearing as much as I am with this one. Hearing Barr's comments are interesting especially to a paralegal student. The Justice Department should not be bullied!
@politvidchannel I would hope that Barr has the backbone to stand up to Trump when it comes to recusing himself from the Russia probe. I was glad when Jeff Sessions recused himself. I was appalled when he took a beating from Trump. I just hope that Barr would not take a beating from Trump.
@tribelaw @amyklobuchar @SenatorDurbin @KamalaHarris I was glad that he answered that he would allow the Mueller investigation to continue. I am unnerved that he hasn't been asked if he would fire Mueller without cause. I would like to see that question be asked.
@krassenstein I am watching the William Barr hearing right now. So far it has been interesting. I had forgotten that he had been AG under Bush 41. He has clarified certain pieces of his memo which is good. Beginning to leave me with positive feelings.
Our "so called" stable genius is a "unstable orange moron" who has no idea what the hell he is doing. He's a traitor; a low IQ since he makes decisions that are irrational. He has a brain disease known as "Putin" and "I'm a Russian asset" https://t.co/alwDaU9iwG
If @realDonaldTrump were listening, I would tell him this: Mr President,	you are holding 800,000 gov workers hostage by not paying them. Travelers are at risk. Somehow a gun was able to get onto a flight from Atlanta, GA to Japan. You are unfit for the office of President. Resign https://t.co/HyLwOdc8Qn
@realDonaldTrump Ask yourself this question: why are 800,000 gov workers having to go to food pantry's for food? Why are you getting $ from people staying at the Trump Hotels and 800,000 workers go W/OUT a paycheck? end the shutdown now! This is on your shoulders and yours alone!
@realDonaldTrump What happened to the other caravan before the Midterm elections? They didn't get through since they are STILL in Mexico. The only thing that WILL keep our country safe is having you resign! Why don't you stop playing political games and YOU end this #TrumpShutdown2019? You can!
The orange traitor moron is a pathological liar. He's a failure as a business man and NOW as president. His intelligence asset shows every day he denies he "worked" for Russia. He constantly commits treason by siding with Putin. #Impeach45 NOW! https://t.co/glfKB3xojY
the dumbest thing @realDonaldTrump has ever done was run for president. the next -- getting the republican nomination and finally winning the 2016 election. From 1/20/17, our country has gone to hell in a hand-basket under his "watch". He has done NOTHING to be "praised". https://t.co/7fxgtrSbaQ
I don't think anyone can really explain. I don't think Evangelists are Christians since they don't follow Christ's teachings on "Loving Your Neighbor" "Do unto others as thou would do unto you". To them, it is okay to speak with "forked" tongues and be "false" Christians. https://t.co/ziS20WAGxW
Yeah. Those lawyers will be NEEDING lawyers after Mueller presents his report to the Congress and to the new Attorney General. It will be interesting to see what those lawyers will do once the Mueller report becomes public! https://t.co/NRugPL8JDq
@realDonaldTrump can bring in a catering company and PAY FOR IT OUT OF HIS MONEY! if he keeps his White House staff on furlough, he will have to eat ALL his meals at Trump Hotel. Oh, but those people may be on furlough as well! oh, dear! is the moron going to starve? hope so! https://t.co/vtvPt3nVDK
Isn't this the truth. Congress works for us NOT Trump. Somehow, McConnell thinks Congress works for Trump and that especially goes for McConnell working for Trump. You may as well include Graham, Cruz and any other GOP Senator who supports this racist wall. https://t.co/DEZ2y5gc96
@senatemajldr Open this government NOW! I just heard on the news about a gun getting onto a flight from Atlanta to Japan! You talk about SAFETY; what about traveler safety? you, the GOP and Trump ARE to blame for this shutdown! bring a vote to the senate floor.
Amen to that! Rep Steve King should be censored! Racism has no place in both the Senate and the House. I want that racist to be stripped of his seat in the House as well! https://t.co/AINw0vb5Wz
@DennisRewire would have been nice if Mich McConnell had used the term "white supremacy".  He is just as much of a coward for not using the correct words. If McConnell can't say "white supremacy" may be he should get a new line of work. Is he a white supremacist in sheep's clothing?
@girlsreallyrule I want members of the House Judiciary Committee to censure Rep King over his latest remarks on white supremacy. Seems to me that he may be one in sheep's clothing. Maybe he does need a new line of employment. He sure does not deserve to be elected to Congress with that attitude.
@sarahcwestwood If McConnell thinks the Steve King should consider resigning because of his racist comments, why doesn't he do that with President Trump? That is speaking out of both sides of his mouth. McConnell should consider resigning. We need the House Judiciary Committee needs to step in.
Now, this is what I call doing someone's Christian duty. Feeding someone, especially during a crisis like this shutdown, is something we all can do. We can take lunches and dinners to TSA, air traffic controllers. https://t.co/zdIA5yKsEZ
@krassenstein @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump I am a democrat; have been and will always be a democrat. I NEVER called for Comey to be fired. I never, and will never, support this racist wall. I support border security using technology with better scanning equipment. Drugs are smuggled are our ports of entry.
I bet @realDonaldTrump isn't getting too much sleep because Federal workers are suing the Federal Government over this shutdown. He deserves not to get any sleep. This is a #nightmare for everyone in the United States! https://t.co/BIIrPCjdrw
I hope Rep. King is sanctioned for his comments on white supremacy and why it is unwelcome and unworthy of his elected position. Maybe Rep. King should find another line of work. Is he a white supremacist underneath sheep's clothing? https://t.co/Gweun7jy1n
Thank God I am sitting on my couch while I read what McTurtle is saying about Rep. King's statements being unwelcome and unworthy of his elected position. I almost fell off my couch the first time I read it. Is this the McTurtle who won't let House bills come to the senate floor https://t.co/Gweun7jy1n
Must be a big slap in the face for cry baby Trump and his regime. Not that I feel sorry for the sociopath. I am grateful for that nationwide injunction to block his attempt to intervene in the availability of affordable birth control! Women win and he's the cry baby losing! https://t.co/cibgRlQc5k
Thank God for the #Resistance! We won't let the fascist Trump regime get the best of us as we Resist harder the more they try to push us around! My father calls me "Tiger" and I will fight like one! Trump will not see Heaven but HELL in the afterlife. https://t.co/njkRcq0R37
@ChuckGrassley How nice of you to do that. Now PAY THEM! Matter of fact, forgo your OWN pay and pay those employees their rent/mortgages, food, gas, electric, water, medicine, healthcare, doctors' visits. You and the rest of the members of the GOP in Congress can do that; GOP Shutdown!
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Democrats did not call for James Comey's firing. get your facts correct. This CORRUPT #GOP and you embarrass me and my relative; the 16th President -- Abraham Lincoln! You are a HUGE hypocrite to your party and to what USED TO BE CALLED THE "LINCOLN PARTY". SHAME ON YOU.
@SmashlyJerkface @UsedToBeJonesy @reevynap Thank you. This border wall talk is making me so upset. @realDonaldTrump forgets that drugs come into our country by smuggling into our ports of entry and then being distributed on the streets. Can we bang it into the orange moron's head somehow?
Trump doesn't understand that drugs are seized at our ports of entry. He ONLY thinks they come across the southern border. Just how stupid does he think we are? His base is what is making this travesty of a shutdown continue. https://t.co/9Kn3lHFdQP
@HillaryClinton has ALWAYS BEEN right! She hit it right on the nose when she said "A puppet" when it came to Trump doing Putin's bidding. Thank you, Hillary, for letting us know what we knew Trump to be; Putin's puppet!" https://t.co/UEHUMjgFMf
DONALD TRUMP CONNED HIS WAY INTO THE PRESIDENCY! 	DONALD TRUMP IS NOT A HUMAN!	DONALD TRUMP IS A DOTARD!	DONALD TRUMP IS A TRAITOR!	DONALD TRUMP IS A RUSSIAN ASSET!	DONALD TRUMP HAS NO CHRISTIAN MORALS! https://t.co/3OKKjWWRBc

Humankind really got it WRONG! Not taking care of the earth is one of humankind's disasters. We can't appreciate what the Earth has given to us and we abuse it with waste in the ocean, lakes, air. we go hunting for trophies and leave the animal to rot. We got it wrong. https://t.co/nFDQbSdYxl

@tedcruz THE SENATE GOP are an embarrassment to my relative PRESIDENT ABRAHAM LINCOLN! What used to be known as the "Lincoln Party" is now known for its "Greed Over People". It is now Party before Country. It used to be Country BEFORE party. You and the current GOP embarrass ME.
@tedcruz I am a Native Texan now living in Dublin, OH. I saw you on Meet The Press yesterday and almost threw up my breakfast when I heard you say "no one outside DC cares about the Russia investigation". Well, I CARE!. If Trump is a Russian asset, as a citizen I WANT TO KNOW.
@brycetache @tedcruz Believe me, this native Texan will let Tex Cruz know that people outside DC cares about the Russia investigation. I live in Dublin, OH and I CARE that Trump may be a Russian asset. I would also be suspicious of anyone who doesn't care. Anyone else outside DC care? Let Ted Know.
Kellyanne Conway has lost her marbles. She's working for a traitor and believes this traitor. Benedict Arnold will have company with this administration beginning with Trump and Pence! Both are taking orders from Putin! Pence is just Trump's sidekick! #ImpeachTrumpPenceNow https://t.co/YpiF7WuVJF
Trump is the biggest Traitor. He's also the biggest LIAR! If he thinks he's going to get away with this, he's got another thing coming. We, #Resisters, won't stand for his antics anymore! https://t.co/K9VoBzSyUU
Trump took the OATH OF OFFICE: "I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States." He has NOT HONORED THAT OATH. https://t.co/7zop9RWJ6z

I think they would probably first faint at the sight of Jesus Christ landing his spaceship on the White House lawn and declaring in all his glory that Donald Trump was a half-wit traitor conspiring with Putin to destroy the world. I think they would find out he's a TRAITOR! https://t.co/HBNBbDEknt
add to the list Mitch McConnell (i.e. McTurtle). Possibly even Rob Portman. You might want to just say every Republican in the House and Senate. https://t.co/hmAmPBFGjf
Mr. President,		Do not listen to what Lindsey Graham just told you.	Do not declare a national emergency unless it is because you are calling it since YOU are the NATIONAL EMERGENCY.	Sincerely,	America https://t.co/RR6bDzrXPs
@LindseyGrahamSC This shutdown has cost millions in the way of pay for our government workers; health safety because of the overflowing trash in the national parks; travel safety. Do you &amp; the GOP in the Senate even use the brain to think about things like this? I am appalled!!!!
@Woody35771540 Try again. Trump told Chuck, with CAMERAS rolling in the OVAL OFFICE, that he would be "proud" to shutdown the government and that he would take the "mantle" not Chuck and Nancy. Trump and the corrupt GOP REFUSE to work with Chuck and Nancy. You have it BACKWARDS. GOP's to blame
Trump needs his brain checked to see if he doesn't have the early signs of dementia or Alzheimer's disease. I would not doubt that he has the early signs of Alzheimer's disease. To call a nation, who continues to violate human rights, more honorable than Chuck and Nancy is dumb https://t.co/mfSornEjFe
This is shameful. Trump as well as the GOP should be ashamed of their shutdown of the government.

like we have seen crime go down throughout the entire country without a border wall? with or without a wall, the crime rates will not change.

@realDonaldTrump I highly DOUBT that Hispanics will be coming over to the Republican side. You are showing your racist side toward them. Why should they come over to the Republican side? Why would the Democrats say that DACA is not worth it when you know that is a LIE coming from you? UNFIT POTUS
THE UNITED STATES IS a SPECIAL country. How about making sure we keep it that way? Get the 800,000 employees back to work WITH pay? HOLDING Russia and those who SOLD the United States OUT to the Russians accountable? https://t.co/cxBuSUEGQD
@kylegriffin1 Trump is the REAL national emergency. It is interesting to know that only 51% blame Trump for this shutdown. What happened with other 49%? Is that the percentage still support Trump? He needs to be in an insane asylum and in one NOW.
@madera1941 I don't know if there is someone who can get them some food. I have even been trying to find a way and haven not had any luck. I guess we can only keep trying.

The perfect picture of the #RussianAsset known as Trump. Instead of the Bride of Frankenstein, we have the Bride of Putin.

Gee, we should have known that Trump was and still is a #RussianAsset when he asked Russia for Hillary's emails.

@thomaskaine5 Trump just doesn't care what he does to the economy. This shutdown will not only affect our own economy, but it will also affect our trade deals with other countries. He did run on a platform of having those countries who us their debts to pay us. It won't happen now.

@GeoffRBennett @PressSec @nytimes Sarah Sanders has no idea what she is saying about James Comey and Andrew McCabe. Having the FBI open an investigation into wether Trump was secretly working on behalf of Russia is not going to be easy for Sarah Sanders to answer reporters questions when she does a press breifing
Hearing that the FBI has opened an investigation into Trump to see if he was working for Russia makes me jump for joy! If Comey is called to testify before the House Intelligence Committee, I hope it is public! Trump had better be AFRAID of this investigation and of Mueller! https://t.co/H7y8OAY8VC
@realDonaldTrump So glad that the FBI has OPENED an investigation into you. You are the most corrupt president this country has ever had. You are undit to be president.
And Trump must be shaking in his shoes with fear that the FBI investigation of Trump will be added to the Mueller report. I hope it will be. I hope Trump receives the top penalty for Treason as a way to show future presidents of what you can and cannot do. https://t.co/n1lSpdEvmB
I would say if ENOUGH republicans in BOTH houses finally understand what is in Mueller's report and open their eyes that Devin Nunes, Jim Jordan, Mitch McTurtle and Lindsey Graham will go from being allies of Trump to being criminal co-conspriatiors of Trump. https://t.co/QdQFUvR0Dg
I don't think Trump would care if our country was attacked by a foreign terrorist right now. Our past presidents were more concerned about a terrorist attack on our country on their watch.

@HillaryClinton This shutdown is not only a national crisis but also an international crisis. It affects travellers. Our health is in danger because of the trash in our National Parks. FDA cannot alert the plublic of food safty.

@realDonaldTrump just lied to America again. He has colluded &amp; conspired with Russia in 2016. Refuses to stop the hacking from Russia, North Korea, and China into our elections. does that sound like a president we can trust? hell no! did we ever have good relations with Russia? https://t.co/ddbOAp4ITZ
@realDonaldTrump BS. You colluded with Russia in 2016 so you could be elected. You are NOT tougher on Russia. You refuse to stop the hacking from Russia, North Korea and China that influence our elections. You do not belong in the White House. Only Hillary Clinton was qualified to the president.
I almost fell out of my couch when I heard that the FBI were investigating @realDonaldTrump for conspriting with Russia in 2016. On his watch, he is not protecting the USA from hacking from Russia, China and North Korea. Can't wait to see what the FBI comes up! https://t.co/lEYHniey8Z
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, your kind of "humanitarian" crisis is locking up children in cages and separating them from their parents. Not what I call a "humanitarian crisis" nor do I call it being Christian. Do your job by singing the compromised plan that the 5 GOP senators showed you.
I want to see EVERYONE at FOX walk from Honduras with only $100 in their pockets, the clothes on their backs and then try to enter our country without getting apprehended. Tht would be a sight to see. Shall we challenge them to do that? https://t.co/MVc3ftRF9a
@stucam7771 Trump thinks he has the "absolute" power to do this shutdown. He needs to read Article II in the United States Constitution to know what he can and cannot do. He is a CRISIS to everyone on the earth. Congress has to impeach, convict and remove him from office.
Trump may think he can do anything because he says "I have the 'ABSOLUTE' power to do so"  but he doesn't. Needs to read Article II in the United States Constitution about what the President can and cannot do. Trump IS a CRISIS to EVERYONE on the EARTH! We have to get RID of him! https://t.co/QlS6cy1CoB
I like Kamala as well. I like Beto also. Be interesting if they become the 2020 Democratic ticket. It would also be interesting if it were Klobuchar and Beto. I am looking for a really strong ticket who can send Trump and company to the dogs make that the wolves https://t.co/UWdl9Alpgl
Perfect Solution to this damn shutdown! Let us give Trump a taste of HIS own medication and see if air traffic controllers will allow him to take off or land until his damn shutdown is lifted. #FuckTrump #FuckTheWall #ImpeachTheMF https://t.co/2lWtXQx4RQ
PERFECT picture of McTurtle! #DitchTheMitch #DitchMitch2020 McTurtle doesn't deserve to be in the senate anymore especially with him kissing Trump's ass on a daily basis. He's as corrupt as Trump and Pence. https://t.co/fAlasaO7Xq
I suggest that ALL Republicans in the House and the Senate should be FORCED TO PAY THESE workers FROM THEIR OWN PAY. Just watch HOW quickly McTurtle and Graham will AGREE with Democrats to BRING an #EndtoTheShutdown. https://t.co/XGziiAUGd5
@GeorgeTakei These are the best protest chant suggestions for the shutdown I have seen. Can't tell you which one I like the most.
The best protest chant suggestions for this shutdown I have seen! Thank you, George Takei! https://t.co/4TFZ8nsAiR
I would say that would be a good ticket. Biden has more experience than our current sociopath in the Oval Office. I like Beto's ideas and his charm. That ticket would be like the Obama/Biden ticket in terms of experience and charm. Besides, Biden can get our standing on the plus. https://t.co/sGGknK0LYk
Gee, if Lindsey Graham is so depressed and doesn't know what to do, he needs to have his brains checked. He's not helping matters by sucking up to Trump. Not only Graham but McTurtle. Those two need to get off their ass and WORK with Democrats. https://t.co/vv5jtCOn9k
People of Kentucky not only need to start knocking on McTurtle's door non-stop (until he gets the biggest migraine), but refuse to send him back to the Senate again next year. The ass doesn't need all that money anymore. He needs to work with Democrats. He's kissing Trump's ass!! https://t.co/gHMQASIFqM
I would love to see @realDonaldTrump walk all the way from Honduras to the southern border with just the clothes on his back and $100 in his pocket; then I want to see him enter the country without being apprehended. That would be a fun picture to see. TV crew follow him? https://t.co/ikABbBWcLd
If this Top Trump adviser thinks workers are "better off" not getting paychecks, he's got another thing coming. The Trump administration can pay for these 800,000 gov employees rent/mortgages and necessities. Trump and his advisors are psychopaths! https://t.co/cpuveryVoe
Need to call these House Republicans' offices and tell them how wrong they are. Maybe these 7 House Republicans can pay these 800,000 federal workers rent, mortgages, food and basics until they get their first paycheck. What do you think? https://t.co/ZEobxevYUF
I thought we fought one revolution against one "mad" king (King George III). Why do I think we may be dealing with another "mad" king (King Trump)? He said "Make America Great Again". Why not say "Make America Great Britain Again"? At least we can get rid of "King Trump". LOL. https://t.co/jJAw4awzU3
I am jumping up and down with joy that Cohen will be testifying in public on February 7th in from of the Democratic-controlled House Oversight Committee! I'll be happy to hear that testimony! Can't wait to hear Trump's reaction to that testimony. https://t.co/XEpdCr2FFv
@senrobportman I hope you can get everyone, BOTH Democrats and Trump, on board with this. Having the government shutdown and people not getting paid is DANGEROUS. It puts peoples' lives in danger especially those who travel. Does Sen. McConnell and Sen Graham understand this? Does Trump?
@youcnbmywingman She hasn't met me. Neither has Lindsey Graham. This one can fight like a tiger. I think my father was correct in calling me "Tiger" as I do fight like one. Ann Coulter had better stay away from this one. I'd scratch her eyes out.
@realDonaldTrump The money you want for your racist wall can be better used for border security. We can screen more cars coming into the USA for drugs; screen shipments coming into the USA for drugs. Drugs do come through our ports! It is not just at our borders.
This is perfect. We can put this on t-shirts, sweatshirts and parade around town with these on. If we are in DC, walk in front of the White House and Congress. This will tell the GOP how we #resisters feel! https://t.co/AwXQkqMV3r
TRUMP DOESN'T CARE! I don't think he understands that possible "bombs" could get onto flights bound for domestic or international cities. I have already  contacted the White House over this. How it is received is anyone's guess. https://t.co/K3u13D1FqZ
I have a feeling that @LindseyGrahamSC has a late onset mental illness. What kind of mental illness is anyone's guess. Does anyone think Russia knows that @LindseyGrahamSC has a mental illness? My guess is yes. Yet, I could be wrong. What do any #resisters think? https://t.co/SPCW9RUpzL
Gee, so nice of @realDonaldTrump to be so nice to the Dreamers who came here as children. Why can't he be that humane to those children who are still in cages? Oh, I forgot: he's racist! has no humanity in him. https://t.co/9rcW7xVwsC
Dear #GOP,	I just want to say a few things to you	FUCK your Bible passages	FUCK your racism, greed and bigotry	FUCK your outrage of the motherfucker word	The complicity in aiding and abetting @realDonaldTrump with his dreadful policies are HARMING this country. WORSE THAN F-WORD https://t.co/FLfXJs0jFf
My ancestors come from the British Isles, Denmark and Germany. My father's mothers family settled in New Sweden which is in Penn. The last of her side of the family are my cousins, me, my brother and niece. I am proud of heritage; I am sure that others are as well. https://t.co/4TfzdKffjf
Our Founders meant for our government to be co-equal branches so any one branch would not have more power. Well, @realDonaldTrump is making the executive branch more powerful than the Congress and SCOTUS. Are we going to allow it? I SAY "HELL NO"! I can't wait for Feb 7. https://t.co/QGupN4h0et
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Democrats won't support a border wall. They will support border security. Screening more cars coming into the US for drugs would be far better than a racist wall. Drugs also come into our ports. It is the corrupt GOP that don't want to work with the Democrats. WORK WITH DEMS
@dem_proud @Sharron34442344 Let's hope that Cohen's testimony to the House Oversight Committee and the Mueller Report will be enough to make Trump's life a living hell! I have visions of seeing Trump's jaw hit the floor when he finds out on Twitter that he has been #Impeached!  Wouldn't that be great?
@mchovden1785 You and me both! I would love to see him hauled away in an orange straight jacket, in handcuffs, with a sock in his mouth.  It would be a perfect picture on the news to make for a beautiful ending of the day.
@GOPLeader @WhiteHouse Well you and the rest of the idiots at the White House have BEHAVED very badly and also embarrassing. It TAKES TWO to COMPROMISE. Problem is, you and the idiots at the White House don't want to compromise to reopen the government. GOP is CORRUPT! ESPECIALLY THIS GOP!
That picture needs to be shown to @realDonaldTrump to make sure that knows drugs DO FLOW into the United States AT OUR PORTS. It ain't just at the border, it is ALSO AT OUR PORTS https://t.co/NvWJ1PPJtf
the two words I would describe Trump are as follows: "insane" and "moron"	Which two words would you use to describe him? https://t.co/nIlPMzkxxF
THIS is the best news that Mueller can put into his report.  Colludy should be a word and in this case, it is when we are talking about @realDonaldTrump.  Maybe we need to put "colludy" into the dictionary. What do you think, fellow #Resisters? https://t.co/p5saRxP0UO
@realDonaldTrump No, @realDonaldTrump, you are the one who lies. You hold 800,000 gov employees hostage without a paycheck. That is not fair. You LIE to the American public. You are acting like a king. Our founding fathers are rolling in their graves in total shock at how you are acting. UNFIT!
Looks like I had better stock up on popcorn that day. I can't wait to hear the news that day. I can see the headlines now "Today is Trump's worst day in his life; Michael Cohen testifies at the House Oversight Committee.  The House will take that testimony &amp; Mueller Report..." https://t.co/CSloxnssBB
Nevermide the fact that @realDonaldTrump thinks drugs don't enter at the ports like the Port of Los Angeles, drugs do enter at those ports. They enter also in cars coming from Mexico into the United States. One lie that Trump said is "drugs don't come in at the ports" https://t.co/zf1bLUgJtd
@funder @realDonaldTrump Here's a lie. 1) Mexico will pay for the Wall	 2) mexicans are rapists, murderers, they bring drugs and crime when enter our country illegally	3) drugs don't enter at the ports; they only enter at the border.
The problem we have is an INSANE president who thinks everyone thinks he's king. Sorry, I don't think the sociopath is king. He's a danger to our nation especially when he makes friends with foreign adversaries.  If Trump's supporters don't see it, they are TOTALLY SICK https://t.co/lMwBBpZJr9
Amen! Let's make T-shirts, hats, buttons, etc with this prayer! It will go so well and will tell Trump and his supporters how the #Resistance feels at the moment. https://t.co/cnLBadOujO
I am so pissed off at the  GOP and Trump.  Our Founding Fathers are rolling in their graves in total shock; they never expected to see this union be under AUTHORITARIAN RULE. I have a feeling that many Americans will say "bye, bye" to America just to get away from Trump's rule. https://t.co/KZjp4OT2gQ
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump because air traffic controllers are not going to work. The only NATIONAL EMERGENCY IN THIS COUNTRY IS the orange moron: @realDonaldTrump. He is a NATIONAL THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; you and the CORRUPT #GOP WON'T SEE IT AND ACCEPT IT. DO YOUR JOB, SEN GRAHAM.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump If it wasn't for you and the corrupt #GOP and the president not compromising with the Democrats, this shutdown would end. The government would be reopened and people would have paychecks. I will hold the GOP, president and you responsible for any American deaths if planes crash
I bet the White House was not impressed. I hope those Dems took that barrel into the Oval Office and dumped it into Trump's lap as a symbol of the trash he is. #Dems #ImpeacheTheMF https://t.co/w9gzhgQZHt
Why don't we add "insane" before the word moron? His insanity is what is making this country unsafe! What do we have to do to get rid of this moron besides impeach, convict and remove through the 25th? https://t.co/gsquYHR8RI

Every Republican in Congress who back Trump (especially Turtle-face McConnell) are responsible for this shutdown just as much as @realDonaldTrump. It disgusts me and angers me. This current GOP are racist, bigoted, and totally stupid to fall for Trump's antics! https://t.co/LuLrF2qPhW
Humanity to Republicans is $ in their own pockets. Humanity to Democrats means healthcare and education for everybody.

I take it that Rick Scott will run against Trump if he is still in office. My hope is that Mueller pulls a rabbit out of his hat and gets Trump impeached, convicted and removed with that report of his. Then Rick Scott can run up against Pence for the GOP nomination. https://t.co/MOJgyGqOOp
As a resistor, I don't plan on watching tRump tonight.  We live in a free society so everyone in the resistance is free to watch the moron or not. That is my take on it. I prefer not to listen to his lies. I am reading a good book on "Mary, Queen of Scots" https://t.co/6J89zZHlDe
@stucam7771 Don't know if this will answer your question: the moron is insane. he is a pathological liar. His supporters don't see the insanity because they themselves are insane. They believe in this insane wannabe dictator.
@robreiner The only "National" crisis America has is the pathological orange moron liar! He's dangerous to our country and yet his supporters are so blind to that! They are just as insane as he is! I think ALL the insane asylums will be full of Trump and his supporters. Democracy reigns!
President Carter has shown the character of a president by telling the orange moron that Carter does NOT support the moron and his racist wall.  No past president would have built this kind of racist wall along the southern border. Only an insane orange moron would. https://t.co/NBVOmnUUKf
@CarterCenter I know that you would not have discussed something like a border wall with President Trump. I don't support him on this issue as it is racist and it doesn't show the country I know. Thank you, President Carter. You have done much good or our country. I can't thank you enough.
She's worried that Beto O'Rourke would be dangerous as president because he lacks experience? What about the orange moron? He had no experience and HE'S A DANGER TO AMERICA! she's blind to that fact. @RepBetoORourke would not be a danger as president. He would be far better. https://t.co/n2jlKuNx6G
He's worried about migrants being terrorists? He's the THREAT to America. It will take time to undo all the damage he has done. I would even take a year national paid holiday to be enacted when his traitorous regime is finally toppled.  How about an increase during that holiday? https://t.co/FyWpf3n2sE

The problem is, people don't like it when people "fact check" what people say. Trump supporters don't want reporters to "fact check" anything because they believe Sarah Sanders any day; she lies for Trump ALL the time. that is why they wear all those "red" colored glasses. https://t.co/NyUcmKEtfP

From what I have heard on MSNBC, some Americans are fed up with tRump and his antics. His supporters (those "die hard" supporters) will believe him. Others may finally wake up and smell the coffee to see that tRump has done nothing but shit for our country. https://t.co/ZljsKs08a4

Trump BEARS direct responsibility for the deaths of 2 children at the border. His zero tolerance at the border doesn't help in caring for the ill. When hospitals don't care for immigrant children and turn them away, those doctors go against their oaths of "FIRST DO NO HARM". https://t.co/Ox2NBOTYbT

@boldredbull @krassenstein I would say that you, RedBull, need to pull you head out of your butt.

Yep, billions of years of evolution and we've got a buffoon without a brain for president. A buffoon who violates the Constitution on a daily basis and then has a gall to say "everyone would be okay with what I am doing". Did we really deserve this? YIKES! https://t.co/RWRZUcsWfp
I am fine with a Congresswoman cursing. When we have  #SociopathTrump in office, we #Resisters watch children locked in cages; his idolization of white supremacists &amp; murderous dictators; him being a pathological liar &amp; sexual predator; colluding with an enemy; He's a monster! https://t.co/Q0GZtDZwl1
I am thankful for our veterans who served and defended our Country. I am utterly angry at the draft dodger who only wants to destroy it. It is TIME to #ImpeachTheMF. #Resisters, cry out in LOUD VOICES #ImpeachTrumpNow https://t.co/P3nFQCALGR
@realDonaldTrump The Dems were at Congress. You are not WILLING to work with them. You want your stupid wall at the EXPENSE of government employees. Your border security workers may not go to work without pay for months or even years! You need medications to begin to make RATIONAL DECISIONS.
@Turnip2020 THAT is pretty nasty to say to someone. Even I would not say something that nasty to a person. Trump, on the other hand, would say anything to mean and nasty to just about anyone. I am sorry to hear that someone was this nasty to you. Should not have happened.
GOP AND TRUMP believe IN DOUBLE STANDARD! OK for them to "attend gang rape parties"; "brag about sexual assault"; "allegedly rapes his wife". When it comes to a woman calling Trump a "motherf--ker" THEY don't like it and call it "disgraceful".  GOP ARE HYPOCRITES! https://t.co/PMOM7Hfxlu
I can't wait for those Trumpers' grandchildren &amp; future family to see those videos seeing these Trumpers standing with Trump @ his rallies with their MAGA hats, stupid signs &amp; chanting "MEXICO" TO Trump. It will be funny for #Resisters and an embarrassing to the Trumpers' family https://t.co/W6aCNvnn7L
@DogginTrump Nah. You were not too harsh. Should have been harsher! The asshole needed more. He is a "sexist dickhead" and more. Men need to know that they can't use a double standard when it comes to swearing from either men or women! Do I care if I swear? Hell NO!
Where Trump gets his delusional ideas that "everyone want the wall very badly" is beyond me. He is so delusional because he has MISSED taking his medication for such a LONG time. No wonder why he can't make any "rational" decisions. He needs to take his medications! https://t.co/jfJI1gnfsZ
@realDonaldTrump is a #MotherFucker and he knows it even if he wants to deny it. He will ALWAYS  deny anything negative about him. I don't mind calling @realDonaldTrump a motherfucker BECAUSE he is ONE! https://t.co/RxSxjfcFf6
Rush Limbaugh AND Ann Coulter are to BLAME for the government shutdown. Those TWO should PAY for the 800,000 government employees rent/mortgages, food, electric, gas/heat, etc. https://t.co/81GdJFmu3h
Ain't that the truth. Especially with his actions at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019. He has MORE chance to winning a PRISON CELL! https://t.co/Rz7k5DTIsY
The GOPers like to use a double standard for women against men. To them, it is fine with someone who says profanities to lawmakers, to NFL players to African nations and finally to grab a woman by her p*****. But; for a woman to swear, it is not OK with them. Give me a break! https://t.co/0WpCntYSyx
If Trump even tries to use "Nation Emergency" by bypassing Congress, he will be entering into illegal territory. I can see it entering into the courts even into the Supreme Court of the United States. #TrumpShutown #ImpeachTrump https://t.co/9OxbGsdoEk
Much as I like Biden, I believe he is too old to be president. I want to see someone younger running for president. We have someone in the White House who is in his 70s who should not be there. We need someone younger than 70 in the White House. How about a woman, hispanic, black https://t.co/0LdTzM1UwL
Whatever Republican senator who knocked Romney needs his/her brain checked out NOW. What Romney said about Trump is true. Trump has not acted presidential at all. At least Romney and Flake are correct when it comes to Trump. Not PRESIDENTIAL! https://t.co/kvqKAgy0wn
His policies of locking up kids in internment camps, in Texas, where they die is his way to say "This is what happens if illegals cross our border with children". It is disgusting and heartbreaking. Only a sociopath would do the things he is doing now. IMPEACHABLE! https://t.co/CtHgpl9tZd
Finding this out just made my day! Now if only we can get Trump's current lawyer, his cabinet and Trump himself in Prison that would make all #Risters and the #Risistance movement very HAPPY! Can you see all of us singing and dancing in the streets! https://t.co/7aaNZUdZ9m
@senrobportman I hope that Sen McConnell will allow the House plan to come to the floor of the Senate to see if the House plan and the Senate plan can work to reopen the government. 800,000 government employees need their paychecks to pay rent, feed their families and pay their bills.
The problem is, we don't live in a sane world. We live in a crazy Trump world with someone who doesn't take medication to "calm down" and to make "rational" decisions. How he "believes" the American people are behind him with this "shut down" is beyond me. The shut down huts all! https://t.co/KG6orisyFc
AMEN. 	#25thAmendmentNow 	#25thAmendment 	#TrumpShutdown 	#TrumpResign 	#ImpeachTheMotherFcker 	#ImpeachTrump2019 	#ImpeachTrumpAndPence https://t.co/ZBqVO9ShrK
@realDonaldTrump had better read the United States Constitution! He needs to understand that the Framers did not intend for the presidency to dictate policy to either branch of Congress. It is time to #ImpeachTheMotherFcker. He has done everything that IS IMPEACHABLE! #IMPEACH https://t.co/Z4CK9Qloud
If Trump thinks that government employees would agree with this the guy has lost ALL HIS MARBLES! These government employees would laugh at Trump because these people NEED to feed their families &amp; pay their rent! His brain is still in Iraq and sinking in the sand more and more. https://t.co/e5uvrRDLhw
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump That is so very true. If @realDonaldTrump wants to curtail terrorism, he needs to open the government so our government employees can be paid to do their jobs. What would happen if TSA agents are not at the airports doing their jobs? Stuff will go through that shouldn't! Unsafe!
While Trump would prefer to use the word "strike" over "shutdown" at his profanity-laced meeting with lawmakers, this is a #TrumpShutdown. It will always be a #TrumpShutdown no buts about it. It is time for the 25th Amendment! https://t.co/mhxLO9IaJZ
@SpeakerPelosi I believe the Founders are shocked with today's government. I agree with you that there is no excuse for one chamber of Congress refusing to do its job and simply giving power over to the President. I believe in the Democrats and their way of governing. I believe in you!
This just tells me that Trump is GUILTY AS SIN! I CAN'T wait to see those indictments before Mueller is finished. I look forward to seeing this administration all in ORANGE JUMPSUITS and being ESCORTED out of the White House in handcuffs! I will be singing and dancing! https://t.co/bv8tcLtHTZ
AMEN! It is TIME FOR the 25th Amendment. I sure wish former Sen Harry Reid was still in the Senate. He would have given Trump a good swift kick in the ass at both meetings. Keeping this shut down for as long as he needs, Trump is entering into possible illegal territory. https://t.co/10WXe6C7sG
Every time I see him on the news the mute button goes on! I can't deal with all those lies coming out of that mouth. Hearing today that he'll keep the shutdown for months or years sends shivers up my spine. His time has come to an end. We have to IMPEACH, CONVICT, REMOVE! https://t.co/dZay3I2U4j
Dear @realDonaldTrump,	Your time in the presidency is almost up. Your complicit GOP will not be able to save you. Neither will your complicit cabinet. We are fed up the all the lies and all your crimes!	You don't UNDERSTAND the Constitution, RULE OF LAW,&amp; TRUTH.	America https://t.co/M50D8lm3us
Dear @realDonaldTrump,	You had better get your facts correct. When past presidents have not confided in you about building a wall along the border, you are lying to the American people. I suggest you get your facts correct before you say something like this.	American Resistance https://t.co/2APGtUO6es
@thehill @realDonaldTrump is NOT doing a "great job".  He has yet to see the Mueller report. He better be prepared to answer questions before House Democrats and then before the Senate while on trial. He will be impeached. He is all alone because some of his GOP "allies" are turning away.
The picture with the words "No More" should tell people and the NRA something. We #Resisters and others are not going to TOLERATE anymore people being killed by mass shootings. It is getting out of hand. https://t.co/3DmySDU0Q2
@tedlieu I recognize the Gable House Bowl. I lived in Rancho Palos Verdes back in the early 1980s. This is sad. My prayers go out to the victims and families of this mass shooting. I am thankful to the first responders as well.
I recognize that bowling alley. I lived in Rancho Palos Verdes, California which is near Torrance, California. This makes me sad to hear. I hope there are no more people that were killed at that shooting. Prayers go out to these families of these three that were killed. https://t.co/LzgeJAl0P9
I agree; the poor baby did not want the country, much less the entire world, to see him be chewed out by Pelosi or even Schumer. What Trump doesn't understand is he is up against one tough Speaker: @SpeakerPelosi is not one to run over especially with profanities. https://t.co/wIlRyZLKyL
The history books will show how Donald Trump was as president; a NOTHINGBURGER! Wasn't that what was said about the Trump Tower meeting in 2016? It will show that Trump was another Benedict Arnold to the USA. Would love to be the fly on the wall to see that. https://t.co/E4CkKMpMiP
That's all the Republicans like to do: give themselves the RAISES while RESISTING in raising the minimum wage in America. What's the problem here? Where's the fairness? Oh that is correct -- raises for the GOP in Congress and stagnant wages for the rest of us. Needs to change!!!! https://t.co/5h56sqacDy
@realDonaldTrump is so delusional! He is NOT the greatest president; nor has he done a good job with our economy. He has not had too many successes and some Republicans are now leaving his support. This tweet is a pathetic lie. https://t.co/wRh973gLGB
Congresswoman Rashida Tiaib did not disgrace her family by using "profanity"  against Trump. Trump uses profanity far more. He has disgraced his family with his sideline antics with a Pron Star and a Playboy Bunny while his Trophy Wife was pregnant. https://t.co/OqPoUnqzxT
@realDonaldTrump is acting like a 2 year old brat. Strike that, a crying baby! He wants to shutdown the government so months or years to get his precious wall; I think NOT! #ImpeachTheMFer #ImpeachTrump We need to send his ass to PRISON NOW! He can cry all the way to prison! https://t.co/ttufldSdEP
Clearly, Trump's spokesman doesn't understand the freedom of "free speech" that is under the First Amendment. If Trump and his administration cannot deal with someone who says something about "impeachment", they should NOT be in Washington, DC. https://t.co/9K6AObOLgV
@davidmweissman That's easy; Conservative media hates liberals and calls us names like "snowflakes"; "morons"; "Demoncrats" and even Communists". It is all hatred to keep this nation polarized. I try to ignore it, but it is not easy. I will never understand the conservative media and their hate.
I would be wondering why these idiots would WANT TO DO business with Trump anyway before he was president. I would be wondering why these idiots would want to continue doing business with the "Foundation" while he is president. Those idiots really need their brains checked. https://t.co/5gJVGdRtij
@realDonaldTrump You can use the $5 billion for Technology to SCREEN more cars for drugs and shipments, AT PORTS OF CALL, also for drugs. It is you that is making this whole situation DANGEROUS. At least Sen Flake has not lied to the American people like you have and still do. Unfit to be POTUS
To the Greed  Over People, it's okay for MEN to say "motherf*cher" but not WOMEN because Republicans BELIEVE in the OLD DOUBLE STANDARD! IT'S THE "DO AS I SAY, NOT AS I DO". My great-grandmother would be screaming profanities at this current GOP and Trump! https://t.co/i7fiYnXUdP
That is a GREAT idea! You have MY VOTE for this National unfollow Trump Day. I won't follow him at all. I will send him "nasty" tweets though "politely" said in a way that gets the point across. Create that National Unfollow Trump Day! https://t.co/UUGQuIQ1Rz
@ProudDemResists Trump keeps saying that to distract us from the Mueller investigation. We know that he is NOT the greatest president of all time. If anyone was the greatest president of all time, it was Lincoln. Trump is WORST president of ALL TIME. He'll rot in hell with his crime family.
@PamKeithFL Amen to that. I can see getting 8 Senate seats from this list. I want to see Sen. Turtle-face McConnell out of the Senate as well as Susan Collins. Both lie at the drop of a hat. Seems that Russia has something over Graham. We've got to send these people back to their states.
SO GLAD that Sen Turtle-face McConnell is getting mocked for keeping government closed just for Trump!  I will be glad to see Turtle-face McConnell lose his next reelection next year. Senate and House GOP are CORRUPT CRIMINALS! https://t.co/TrGkDkQUPK

@WambemKristine @cwalisc @thehill You are the idiot. You want to to pay those workers' rent right now? How about paying for the necessities like food, electric, gas/heat, medication, etc? It is the current payments that are at stake at the moment. The current necessities, idiot. I sure hope you can help out.

@GodCountryFami5 @PaulMcC83290271 @cwalisc @thehill @realDonaldTrump I don't even have to worry about using birth control since I can't have children. You don't seem to understand anything when it comes to medical emergencies that would require an abortion to save the mothers life. I wish you PRO-LIFERS WOULD KEEP YOUR NOSES OUT OF THE BEDROOM
I would say you are correct. He should stay in the Senate. I think he is too old to run for the presidency anyway. Someone in their 70s should be running be running for president. https://t.co/ODOJdzPqXQ
Best list that I have see this morning! https://t.co/wj6Dq6pSAH
I hope that what is in Mueller's report can make it possible to indict the president while he is still in office. I hate this waiting and sitting on the edge of my couch wondering what kind of information he has. Hurry up, Mueller, and finish this investigation. https://t.co/BLBuOiCO44
I wish Obama was STILL president. He would have sustained the Market growth and more than likely gotten our economy going far better than what we are seeing right now.

Didn't you hear his comment this morning? He actually said that the American people believe the same way he does. BS. 800,000 gov employees w/out paychecks, state parks with garbage overflowing is a hazard to health. He's CRAZY! Brain is SINKING IN THE SANDS OF IRAQ! https://t.co/tN0rHxiv7H
I hope that Mitch @senatemajldr McConnell has his days in the Senate numbered very soon! Kentucky deserves a far better Senator.

@krassenstein @therealkenecik Evangelicals speak with forked tongues! Marriage Equality is an abomination to God. Cheating on your wife with a Playboy model &amp; paying her off in order to his that info from the people voting for you if perfectly fine! They have ZERO BRAINS! I think they had split brain surgery
Dear @realDonaldTrump,	America is WAITING to SEE YOUR TAX RETURNS!	All Presidents are REQUIRED to produce their TAX RETURNS when they run for PRESIDENT in the first place. Obviously, YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO HIDE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. PRODUCE THEM NOW!	SINCERELY,	AMERICA https://t.co/tBvn4MXDHo
Dear MAGA,		Mitt Romney and the rest of America, especially those of us who are proud "libtards" "snowflakes" as well as "#Resisters, would appreciate it if you WOULD ACT the way Jesus TAUGHT in his TEACHINGS that are FOUND IN ALL FOUR GOSPELS. READ THEM.		SINCERELY,	AMERICA https://t.co/Eo80rtTjVT
I hope her medical license is taken away from her. She has no business being a doctor if she would "purposely give Jews the wrong meds".

While the Separation of Church and State is NOT in the Constitution, Thomas Jefferson argued about it in a letter to the Danbury Baptist Association in 1802. For those who argue about having prayer in school, I suggest you read Jefferson's letter to these people in 1802. https://t.co/Y59FqLVhP2
@atDavidHoffman @DennisCardiff PLEASE READ Thomas Jefferson's letter to the Danbury Baptist Association in 1802. In it he argues about the separation of church and state.

@UROCKlive1 @leeicewitz1 If Trump thinks he would make a good general, his mind has REALLY TURNED INTO MUSH! Then again, where did that mind go? He did say that he is losing his memory after his visit to the troops in Iraq; that's where his mind is -- IRAQ -- IN THE SAND AND SINKING!
I'd just as soon as see Bernie stay in the Senate. He would be better in the Senate as he does a great job being a great voice for Vermont and the nation. If Pence becomes president &amp; is not impeached, convicted and removed, I think whoever becomes the Democratic nominee will win https://t.co/S3SHbOZ7H1
I agree that if he does "resign" he will blame his "enemies" (e.i. Democrats and probably those of us in the #Resistance). I would rather that he be impeached, convicted and removed &amp; jailed in federal prison. Hopefully the #GOP have realized that they can't stay quiet anymore. https://t.co/oxLRpgrkwz
And the #GOP will be hopping mad that they will be unable to stop Democrats from holding them ACCOUNTABLE! It is about time that the #GOP is held accountable! I can't wait for the Democrats to be in control of the House and to do their investigation into the #sociopathinchief. https://t.co/OrRGEPIyA7
It won't work because Trump and the GOP are afraid to even try to see if it WILL work in our country. These people REFUSE to look at the countries where it works to see how universal healthcare works. Only Trump and the GOP can be that stupid https://t.co/2GDU6M2d3p
Out of that mouth, one can't figure out what Treason Trump's thoughts are. The US is on a roller coaster when he keeps talking about his wall and who is going to pay for it.

I would not be surprised if the #GOP are saying "am I at risk of losing my Senate seat when I am up for reelection if I keep supporting Trump?" They don't want to lose control of the Senate.

@2bebecki @62WalterP @GOP I think so as well. I would not be surprised that many in the #GOP are going "am I going to lose my Senate seat when I am up for reelection?" if they are not already thinking that way. I am sure that they are afraid of losing control of the Senate. They are ALL COMPLICIT! GUILTY!
@sharonbw22 I know what you mean. I still can't believe that there are people who still support him these days. I want my boyfriend to wake me when its over. I think I am getting tired of constantly seeing the #sociopath's face in the news much less hear that he has tweeted another lie.
I already see three that can go back home: Sens Cronyn, Collins and McConnell! All three need to leave the Senate and give the Democrats the majority. I can't seem to think of the fourth or fifth one. Can someone else come up the one? https://t.co/b0mKQVdmRD

@allan_bucher I doubt that @realDonaldTrump even KNOWS what the word "patriotism" means.  He never served in the military and now wants to treat our military leaders like they are shit. I wish we could exile Trump, his crime family and all Trump's supporters to a deserted island. Trump's Isle!

@EdKrassen What's a mystery to me is how people who call themselves Christians will go to church on Sundays to confess their sins, do the same sins all over again &amp; then go back to church again to confess their sins again. Why call yourself a Christian if you are not going to act like one?
Some evangelicals might be saying Trump is immoral. The others who are masquerading as evangelicals to rationalize their politics and bigotry will always believe in Trump and his own politics &amp; bigotry; not only IMMORAL BUT LOADS OF CRAP. https://t.co/GL7IWCqQ0T
Obviously, Jerry Falwell Jr thinks he is "moral" (or has morals) for supporting Trump. Maybe some Evangelicals might be "waking up" and seeing that tRump is an immoral idiot that they cannot support. I will believe it when I see it. https://t.co/I4cjmqVzrk
@realDonaldTrump I trust that you don't think that you are above the law because you are not. No one is above the law. Your MAGA is not working. Stock market is dropping and by the end of the year, we will be in a recession. Only a Republican would screw up this nation.
@TravisAllen02 I can't believe it is actually real as ell. I must be diagnosed with that syndrome like all the #Resisters. At least I know something about people not being above the law which includes the president; I believe in Justice and Truth; and I am nauseated at the sight &amp; sound of him.
I love the predictions! Looks like Trump will be heading out the door this year! I can't wait to see all his supporters with their jaws hanging to the floor with total shock: "how can you deceive us? we trusted you?" is what they will cry. Didn't we warn them about Trump? YES!!! https://t.co/Evjq4C7fe5

AND in turn, the #NRA gives thousands of $ to those who are for gun rights.

Nope! https://t.co/Hc633zrwhy

AMEN! I am sure that the #NRA is madder than hell! Anyone want to take wagers that the #NRA will file a lawsuit in the Washington State Supreme Court over this ban? I can see it now: the headlines reading " #NRA loses case against Washington State's semi-automatic ban" Funny!!! https://t.co/yfSDLWT49g
Trump is TRULY RESPONSIBLE for this #ShutItDown. It is NOT a #SchumerShutdown as the #GOP, Trump, and Trump supporters like to say it is. #Resisters, don't believe it when people say it is a #SchumerShutdown when it is a #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/AUc9Ulu8Q9
True. @realDonaldTrump thinks it is perfectly fine to spew out those emissions from coal plants and exposing the citizens of the USA to deadly neurotoxins &amp; poisons. The sad part, it will affect his health at one point. He and those coal/oil barons with a terminal illness! YES! https://t.co/1Blnkbowy2
Hey #Resisters, I think we all have been diagnosed with the same syndrome! We all have a clear understanding of the rule of law; a feeling of nausea at the sight &amp; sound of Trump; an addiction to Justice and Truth. Does this sound like anyone in the #Resistance movement? Yep: ME https://t.co/sXSmAdTmkv
@krassenstein Well Brian, then all of us #Resisters must be diagnosed with the same syndrome. We all have a clear understanding of the rule of law; a feeling of nausea at the sight &amp; sound of Trump; and an addiction to Justice and Truth. What do you think?
@senrobportman Happy New Year, Sen Portman! Hope you have a blessed New Year this year.
@realDonaldTrump You do not know anything about "the art of the deal". You can't keep your promises to America like having Mexico pay for this stupid wall. You are to blame for this #shutdown! You are stiffing 800,000 gov employees of their paychecks!
Calling on all #Resisters, beware of what the right wingers and the rest of the corrupt GOP are trying to do: divide the Democratic party like they did when Bernie and Hillary were running back in 2016. Stay STRONG #Resisters! We can beat the #GOP at their game and win the WH! https://t.co/TYr4XOADAw
Yep! That's the art of the "pig's squeal"! Maybe he can make those inmates try to "deal" (better yet -- learn to squeal) on certain issues. If he ever actually "learns" the art of the "pig's squeal" the world will celebrate along with the United States! https://t.co/4pTvrvM35A

@FoxNews Thank you for being so quite! It is so nice not to hear you tweet or make any noises since you got Trump to SHUTDOWN the government. He throws a $1,000 per ticket New Years Eve gala while stiffing 800,000 gov employees of paychecks. REMAIN QUIET FOR A WHILE!
New Years Resolutions:	- Renew my State ID	- stock up on more popcorn for this continuation of a soap opera	- cut down on my coffee	- to see the #sociopathinchief impeached, convicted and removed and see him	  &amp;his crime family EXILED to Siberia so they can freeze their asses! https://t.co/zUZq8Ceig7
Trump supporters won't say anything about the National Debt ballooning even higher under Trump, because they love the #sociopath! They are just as bad as he is. They will bitch about someone they truly hate, but remain quite about someone that they truly adore. They are NUTS!!!! https://t.co/PeAuXyBvNR
YEP! The alt-right:	- can call me a snowflake, libtard, demoncrat	- attack me with lies	- you WON'T STOP ME FROM TWEETING!!!!!	I won't accept your hateful rhetoric!	I won't accept your so-called Christian attitude; you don't have those MORALS! https://t.co/RcMoHVzpdi
Lord only knows what Putin has on Trump. Lindsey Graham, Rand Paul and all the other Republican traitors. Will we ever find out? Good question. Maybe yes and maybe no. These idiots are CREEPS and DON'T belong in GOVERNMENT! https://t.co/hOgOcnTra6
@joncoopertweets @Wildwom68516811 That is probably a question that we will never know the entire answer to. I hope we find out the answer to that question, but it may be a LONG time coming. I do believe that Putin does have SOMETHING ON Trump, Lindsey Graham, Rand Paul, and all the other Republican traitors.
#BuckeyeNation #Buckeyes #OhioState all the way! I am a #BuckeyeNation fan and always will be. Hopefully my father will root for his al mamarter. https://t.co/eASNmh1Wdx
@InspiringU2 the #sociopathinchief! otherwise known as @realDonaldTrump. Don't make me sick to my stomach, God. This idiot ain't worth being our president; oh, that is correct -- he is the illegitimate president! We all know he is the illegitimate president!!!!!
That is because so many people are too stupid to realize that McConnell is the worst senator that Kentucky could ever have. They need a better person to represent them. Someone who actually cares about the people of Kentucky. https://t.co/affw5v85hA
Would anyone really pay $1,000 per ticket to go to Trump's Mar-a-Lago New Year's Eve party? I sure would not. I have better uses for $1,000 than going to a #sociopath's New Year's Eve party that costs that much; especially when he is stiffing 800,000 gov employees paychecks https://t.co/Bi4izapzEj
The worst Trump staffer: Ivanka Trump followed by Jared Kusner https://t.co/VktK8VocDC
And they should! If they find out that he threw a huge New Year's Eve party at Mar-a-Lago while stiffing their paychecks, there will be hell to pay! Trump administration won't be able to protect Trump from this lawsuit! https://t.co/zNMjEeNMzu
Would not be surprised if Melania finally wakes up and realizes she married a bully. You don't see her smile when she is with Trump even when Barron is with them. She practically has to paste a smile on her face. Anybody see divorce #4 for Trump coming soon? https://t.co/LQyCNID3YC
This was one of his BIGGEST LIES about women. He has NO respect for women. If his trophy wife thinks he "respects" her, she is out of her mind. He has NO respect for marriage vows. He flatly does not RESPECT WOMEN! @realDonaldTrump, you are a CREEP! https://t.co/1AoYVYUU9H
@NancyPelosi @eegodess @realDonaldTrump Thank you! I know that Democrats in your capable hands as Speaker of the House will pass something to get our country our of this #TrumpShutdown. Those employees need to be paid for the work that they have done and we need a government working. @realDonaldTrump doesn't understand
The best poll I could wake up to. Seeing Muller in the lead as Person of the Year for 2018! I hope he is person of year for 2019. It may be a tie between him and Nancy Pelosi though. This year is gonna be a good year! https://t.co/l2FAZ1F0kq
Amen. Maybe that would give the GOP a good taste of what average Americans do: live paycheck to paycheck. It is doubtful that the GOP could comprehend "living paycheck to paycheck" with all those noses sticking up in the air saying "I am better than most Americans". https://t.co/K8kdJqTYsa
@SenSchumer Happy New Year to you and your family, Sen Schumer! May this year be filled with blessings for you and for America.
Dear @realDonaldTrump,	You screwed up America with your lies, inhumane policies, sucking up to Russia, and now your pathetic shutdown. Well you can stuff it! Better yet, #KISSMYASS! In case you haven't read the Constitution, we have the right to protest.	Sincerely,	America https://t.co/qqpNuBkwhu
@ChasingOzPhotog The Parkland Students. They stood up for changes in gun laws and saw some get changed in Florida. Their voices were heard by some politicians even if some other politicians just brushed them off.
@ScottWalker She would be a whole lot better than the #sociopath we currently have in the White House. I can't wait to see #IndividualOne impeached! Can't wait to see him find out that he's impeached via Twitter!
AMEN TO THAT! HAPPY NEW YEAR TO MY fellow #Resisters! To the impeachment of #IndividualOne and the rest of the GOP feeling the tight reign of the Democrats in the House with Speaker Pelosi! CHEERS! https://t.co/lt7Cz8HOSg
I can only add to that list "corruption". Can anyone else com up with other labels for Trumpism? https://t.co/Rj17D4yaKv
@PamKeithFL How about adding Corruption? Can't think of others.
And I can agree with that. I have always respected the President no matter party affiliation or ideologies. I cannot abide by what I see as a middle age adult. I DO NOT RESPECT TRUMP. Nor will I call him my president. He does not deserve my respect or acknowledgment as president https://t.co/jC4UJ4V8BQ
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump If the GOP would use their brains and not their stupidity, maybe things might get done. Border security means screening more cars for drugs, screening shipments coming into the USA for drugs. Don't go back to the Middle Ages, Mr. President. We are living in the 21st century.
@realDonaldTrump is fucking nuts! Elton John has MORE brains than this lard ass of an non-patriot traitor! He's broken more records of being the greatest liar in history. Can't wait to see this lard-ass non-patriot traitor impeached and convicted! https://t.co/uhXU71g3Gd
I have too many favorite hashtags for 2018 that it hard to choose from. I suppose I could say that these are three of my favorites: #ResignTrump; 	another: #TrumpEqualsFailure; another #sociopathinchief. https://t.co/GDhxzKhs18
@krassenstein You ain't kidding. Don Jr. may think he will be getting off, but you and I know he won't be getting off. 2019 is going to be a great year with the Mueller report soon. I am looking forward to seeing this crime family behind bars! Trump in an orange suite and handcuffs!
That look on Trump's face tells me "get out of my way. Got to get to the men's room FAST!" https://t.co/cI7z1iGT9X
@PamKeithFL @leeicewitz1 Who do you think would be a good ticket to win back the White House for the Democrats? I like Kamala and Beto as well. I don't want to see Bernie run again. I am a Progressive as well. How do you feel about Elizabeth Warren running for president?
Great photo to end the day! Ginsburg could really take a swat at Trump when it comes to health and her ability to function as a justice. She's great as a justice while he's a non-patriot of a fake president who lied about having "bone spurs" to get out of the draft. https://t.co/3cIE8HN8zk

That's right, he is throwing a huge New Year's Eve party at Mar-a-Lago while stiffing 800,000 gov employees of their paychecks. To top it all, he is billing the taxpayer for this party and it will cost us thousands! Time to return that bill to him and his crime family to pay. https://t.co/CoNSJUFthU
@leftyjennyc @DNC Bernie Sanders has got to stay in the Senate. I don't know how I feel about Elizabeth Warren running. She has a great voice in the Senate as well. But; please, DNC, tell Bernie Sanders to remain in the Senate.
@AshGomes3 The Parkland students did not make Nik Cruz. His problems were not their making. Everyone makes their own problems. These sociopaths and psychopaths who should not get their hands on guns; why we need to combine both mental illness and gun control when discussing this.
@KristyR0310 I know about this history.  What I see as a big problem are those who own guns and are not willing to talk about keeping those with mental problems from getting their hands on guns. That is what I am pissed off at. Those at the NRA and ignorant ones who support them.
@AshGomes3 Nik Cruz was a #sociopath. He had massive mental problems and should not have had his hands on a gun in the first place. I don't believe the Parkland kids' politics are trying to make peoples' lives more violent. Sorry you don't believe in gun control. I believe we need it. NOW!
I'll take Bill Clinton and Barack Obama over @realDonaldTrump as president ANY DAY! Clinton and Obama are WAY smarter than @realDonaldTrump. Trump never went to law school so he can't say anything about being "smarter". The idiot's brain is all MUSH (that is IF he even has one) https://t.co/ZOSl4J3zJ7

@Shanghaijr16 I found this to be disturbing. Foreign interests that want to take over the world scare the hell out of me; and I am talking about Trump/Putin. The Master and puppet; Trump does Putin's bidding every day that many resisters in the USA are scared.
@ekww11 You are so correct! WE should shout this from the mountain top! You should see some of the tweets I have set to him telling him that he is not he is not fit to be president. Somehow, I don't think he is happy about it.
I sure do! She could kick ass! If somehow Trump makes it to the 2020 election, Elizabeth Warren could kick his ass to the moon maybe even to Jupiter so he can fry his own ass! https://t.co/2SidyGKZux
@Shanghaijr16 I am feeling that same way. I am hoping for better news after January 3rd from the Dems here in the USA. Steve Bannon did not do the United States and the world a bit of good when he helped that #sociopath into the White House two years ago.
@Shanghaijr16 Trying to stay optimistic about 2019. Hopefully #Muller investigation can link both his illegal presidency and Brexit and prove that they were planed by foreign interests. All #Resisters have to remain strong even in 2019. I hope Trump hears he's impeached on Twitter!
That is only what a dictator would want to create. Sorry, @realDonaldTrump, the United States are not going to fall for that unless people are that stupid to fall for this. He is destroying our democracy as we know it. Our founding fathers are rolling over in their graves. https://t.co/WlQlTok6VN
HOW about combining 	Baby Diaper Shit Gibbon as @realDonaldTrump's new nickname? That would be perfect for all the shit he has given us since 1/20/17. We need a Baby Trump Balloon to put that nickname on the diaper! What do others think? https://t.co/91TbdS862m
Same here. If (and I hope this does not happen) he becomes president, after Trump is impeached &amp; convicted, I hope the next Democratic nominee for President wins by a LANDSLIDE!!!!!!!! https://t.co/RRhMshQlRX
I don't know what I like better on The New Yorker	1. Rex Tiller saying that he hopes Trump finds out he is impeached on Twitter	2. Republicans projected to pick up 70 seats in prison	3. Kushner close to obtaining clearance for Other Government Facility	I am laughing hard!
@clsgolden I didn't say anything about "competency". I do know that @realDonaldTrump IS NOT COMPETENT to be president. His current administration is ALL WHITE! DOES NOT BELIEVE IN DIVERSITY!!!!!! HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH COMPETENCY
Republicans will never believe in Global warming until something drastic happens to them.Then they will begin to believe it. https://t.co/VbhzUHMqJk
I love this poll. With the numbers showing that Warren is so far ahead of Trump, I would be dancing and singing in the streets for days, weeks and months after the November 2020 election should she win if she is the Democratic nominee! https://t.co/n22qwTyDqE
So glad that Senator Warren is running for president. Snagging a black woman as chief of staff is one step forward in diversity in a campaign. If Warren becomes the next president, she will no doubt have a far better cabinet than the current administration has! https://t.co/x8l01qGjfh
This goes to show you that the Generals KNOW MORE about what is going on in Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan. I am so happy that McCrystal believes that Trump is dishonest and immoral. About time that someone in the military, besides Kelly and Mattis, says something like this! https://t.co/l0C6ktpdXr
The BEST NEWS I could wake up to! I certainly hope that the United Nations does launch an independent investigation into the deaths of 2 refugee children during &amp; after being in the Border Patrol custody.

This is the first announcement from any Democrat that I have seen. Way to go Elizabeth Warren! I wonder if there will be other women who will announce their candidacy for the presidency. Going to be an interesting group of people who announce their candidacy for the presidency. https://t.co/NfRCyCcp2k
@realDonaldTrump You did not have a planned exist strategy for withdrawing our troops in Syria. Obama did when he began to withdraw our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. You just decided to pull out of Syria without an exist strategy. Pretty dumb. ISIS will return. It will fall on your watch.
Ain't that the TRUTH! I would rather see that $5 billion go to better uses than having a medieval wall that won't work. We need to be able to screen shipments coming into the US for drugs, hire more hard working police officers on the streets, and help kids stay out of gangs. https://t.co/5lERhgoaE1
We need to throw that bill back into his lap! Throwing  a huge Mar-a-Lago New Years Eve party, while stiffing 800,000 gov employees on their paychecks is PATHETIC! @realDonaldTrump IS A PATHETIC PRESIDENT. A #SOCIOPATH. https://t.co/DupG0Ls9b9
At least he is honest enough to tell people that Trump is not up to the role of president. Now he is saying other things that are making me glad he is leaving the administration. The man was another "adult" in the room besides Mattis. Those two were the only adults in the WH. https://t.co/hp6VsSlHun
The NRA doesn't need my thoughts and prayers. My thoughts and prayers go to those who we lost to the mass shootings in 2018.

@ManMet80 @OneWokeWoman @realDonaldTrump Way to go! Knock out some more if you can! It will make @realDonaldTrump feel even more alone.
@SnakeOilPrez I would not trust her to clean my house; I would be afraid she would steal some family heirlooms. She cannot be trusted. She is as bad as a bedbug. She might be good at killing those bugs; I don't know. I sure would not want to see "Trump Administration" on someone's resume.
@BIGLOBBY Amen! Means we can #impeach Pence as well! It will be so good to get rid of these two that are in the White House. We will have fumigate the White House after the leave in orange jumpsuits and in handcuffs!
Those are my favorite verses in the Bible along with "Do unto others as thou would have do unto you."	"Love thy neighbor as thyself"	"respect the dignity of every human being" (Baptismal Covenant)	I highly doubt that Trump even knows what those mean https://t.co/msdC4IsoNR
@AllardyceMaggie @jupitergirl @Bornabrit1 Yep. It would be a fitting end this orange moron's presidential career; to be EXILED in RUSSIA along with his crime family. It would also be fitting to see them live in SIBERIA trying to make a living there. They would be freezing their asses off! I think we would be laughing!
maybe a worker that tries to kill bedbugs. That might be a good job for her. At least she would be away from the cameras and mixing with getting rid of bugs! https://t.co/Vlq2J03WCm
@Goss30Goss @freddyatton @LindseyGrahamSC has kissed Trump's ass too many times that it isn't funny. He thinks he can get the Democrats to come around to Trump's way of thinking if he can get Trump to agree on DACA. This guy is an embarrassment to SC, the USAF, Senate and the country.
To True! @realDonaldTrump is on the wrong side of history &amp; the wrong side of math. Where @realDonaldTrump learned his math skills is anyone's guess. I just hope the government shutdown comes to an end when the Democrats take over the House this week. https://t.co/6RMTCr38Bj
Same. Michael Cohen is a criminal scumbag. His former client is far worse. I don't know how low one can go below scumbag when it comes to Cohen's former client (we all know who that it: @realDonaldTrump ) https://t.co/cR546NG3uR
I agree! She amazes me as well. For someone as young as she is, it will be amazing to watch her in Congress and to see her aspirations if she wants to run for the Senate or the Presidency. She would be very successful in both. https://t.co/P7DsEjOLvE
And now he blames the Democrats. One lie after another. I think his hair turns more orange than usual every time he gets angry when he talks or tweets. No wonder he is called the "orange moron" or "orange buffoon" https://t.co/MUsvb4CYhz
@krassenstein My new year will be off to a great start! Thank you, Nancy Pelosi! You will be a great Speaker in the House again. I can't wait to see what "kinds" of legal mess that Trump is about to be cornered into. 2019 is looking good already!
BS @sengraham2016! Everything that is happening today falls on Trump's watch! If the U.S. pulls out of Syria, ISIS will return and it will be Trump's fault. BTW, ISIS began when the U.S. went into Iraq under George W Bush! Don't blame Obama; blame George W Bush! https://t.co/y4ZWpLPl3x
@GodCountryFami5 @PaulMcC83290271 @cwalisc @thehill @realDonaldTrump I am a proud snowflake. You are the problem. And no I am not missing a Pro Choice march. Pro Choice DOES NOT MEAN pro abortion. You are the one who is stupid.
@PaulMcC83290271 @cwalisc @thehill Ain't that the truth. What would be a good idea is to take @realDonaldTrump's money from his charity AND give it to those federal workers who are working w/out pay while this #TrumpShutown continues. That is what should happen with that charity money. What do you think?
It's because Conservatives don't care about people losing coverage especially those with preexisting conditions. Only Democrats have a heart that care about people especially those with preexisting conditions. I have a preexisting condition that I have lived with all my life. https://t.co/vTX0UHD70W
I wondered when a Republican would actually care enough to hold hearings on migrant children ho died in federal custody. Should have done that when children were separated from their parents and put into internment camps in the desert. Too lazy to do that. https://t.co/KtZW52b6kH
#Democrats should not budge an inch in giving into @realDonaldTrump's demand for 5 billion or any amount for a useless #BorderWall. @realDonaldTrump has lost his marbles if he thinks a #BorderWall will work. He is so very racist that it makes me sick. https://t.co/8gBi6wFQ9Q

What Trump told the nation were major LIES! to say that "Mexico would pay for the wall" and "I am proud to shut down the government in favor of border security" and then have the gall to ask for 	1. 5 billion for a racist wall	2. blame Democrats for the shutdown.	ALL LIES! YIKES! https://t.co/jaCtgR8hWy
Trump should have stayed out of the "political realm" with his zero experience; he has fucked up our nation so bad. Angelina Jolie would do the same. These people need to stay in what they do best; TV screen and in Hollywood. We need people with political experience to run! https://t.co/Afcc3in3a8
And they are idiots. So called Christians not acting on their beliefs. Did they forget that Jesus said "Whoever does not receive the Kingdom of God like a child will never enter it." I think these idiots and Trump need to read their Bible especially the Gospels! https://t.co/aeV0mFpJ7u
@TheRickyDavila @Wellness4You13 These racist idiots sure don't have any compassion for others. They have compassion for themselves and for Trump (our #sociopathinchief). These are the same people who call themselves "Christians" but don't act on those beliefs.
@wuputah @eyelovezz @cwalisc @thehill Can you just see the landlords and banks receiving these with a look of surprise on their faces? A Trump portrait to pay rent/mortgage with would be so funny to watch that peoples' sides would be hurting!
@shooz3355 @cwalisc @thehill So true! We all heard that on the news especially when he said "I will take the mantel of the shutdown. You won't be blamed. It is on me." What a big fat lie he told to Schumer and Pelosi not to mention the country to those who watched the news. The big orange moron. A major Liar
So TRUE! #GOP #SenateGOP and #HouseGOP are comprised of disgusting, deplorable, shameful, corrupt, criminal, racist, bigoted, homophobic, immoral, inhumane, narrow minded, xenophobic, evil humans (if they can call themselves that). Pompeo: bad! Trump:worst. #rapturethis https://t.co/bwDqiPckqO

Ain't that the truth. 2 years of @realDonaldTrump's hateful rhetoric, harmful policies, racism, bigotry have been a disaster for our nation. His "zero-tolerance" policy resulted in children being separated, put into interment camps, and killed. These deaths are on his hands! https://t.co/LmDh8cc9Ix

Yep. Trump scares the shit out of me. I truly believes he is both evil and insane. I would not be surprise at what he does as impeachment time approaches. He serves the Devil and not God. What he is doing is the Devil's work; it is not God's work. His base are EVIL! https://t.co/wJ9Sz0GTbi

AGREE!!!!! Trump has no idea what he up against: TOUGH Democrats and one tough Speaker of the House: Nancy Pelosi! Trump is a Cry Baby who can't do anything without being told what to do by his base. Was his base "elected" president or was Trump? #ImpeachTrumpNow https://t.co/H3h1lQ0pKu
I would have to agree with Jon Cooper. I'd say that my favorite TRUMP lie so far would probably be "Mexico is going to pay for the wall -- 100 percent".

Ain't that the truth. Those Americans who have hearts cry out for these children who have died. Trump and his supporters do not have hearts for these children who have died; they believe it is the parents' fault and always will. Trump will NEVER ACCEPT accountability! #Resign https://t.co/LNbqhcJGKc
You are so correct! These children died on his watch. Trump is responsible for these deaths. He has allowed US Border Patrol to treat children as though they are toys to be tossed about even if it is to the wolves or to the heat. https://t.co/ffMa3H1fXE
To answer all those questions: the CURRENT #GOP and Trump! https://t.co/GW2csZpNOi
@realDonaldTrump Any deaths of children, in the HANDS of US Border Patrol, is the fault of YOUR pathetic policies and OVERSIZED EGO! Put yourself in their shoes for once. You are a pathetic sociopath.
Any death of immigrant children in US Border Patrol custody should be treated a murder at the hands of US BORDER PATROL CUSTODY. I am tired of hearing about their lack of "care" and saying "it's the parents' fault". It is murder plain and simple; hands of US Border Patrol Custody https://t.co/FHAqoERqP6
The #GOP can NO longer campaign on "Family Values". They don't know what "family values" mean anyway. To them, values have been flushed down the toilet! They say that Democrats don't have values; Democrats HAVE VALUES! #GOP is party of hate, chaos, hypocrisy and racism. https://t.co/pwA5tQPQC3
Probably because his crimes are of more interest; the shutdown is at the forefront. His poor health should be a story; I doubt that his supporters would want to even hear about it as they would say "FAKE NEWS!" https://t.co/FGQIBrjgdw

And Republicans once called themselves the "cut costs" party. They didn't want to spend money on anything. They have now wasted money when Mueller has recouped money for our government. #GOP has added to the nations debt and given the top 1% a tax break. That is called SPENDERS!! https://t.co/hPv3X0kUdH
Trump's warped mind only knows one thing WAR!	war against democracy	war against the media	war against unity	war against decency	war against the truth	war against our planet	war against Democrats	war against our allies	war against racial equality	war against humanity https://t.co/5qXanncXQY
Amen to that! @SpeakerRyan is the worst Speaker in history. Because of him, we have an incompetent traitor as president, the national debt is higher than it was under Obama's administration, the government was shutdown  &amp; he did not do a damn thing. I hope he leaves in shame! https://t.co/AohD355t1j
@krassenstein So true! His fragile ego is getting the best of him and is putting our nation in danger. His warped mind can't understand anything. Can't wait to see what happens when the Democrats take over on January 3, 2019.
@genofied @robertsg62 That is true. Disabled veterans and disabled workers in America face the same plight. I am a disabled worker and I was dumped to the "sidewalk" like garbage. Though I was put onto medication for depression, I still have moments of depression. We do fall through the cracks.
I am a Buckeye fan and a Michigan fan thanks to my father going to both schools. https://t.co/2MITeR3sP7
@wendynilsson @coleyworld @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump, that is what you said two years ago. Now you are asking the American taxpayer to pay for it first. That should not happen. Use that money for border security by using technology and screening more cars that come to our borders. Would help stop the flow of drugs
Do we really want to send our "thoughts and prayers" to the Trump Crime Family? I suppose they should have our thoughts and prayers for trying to find "redemption" and "forgiveness" for what @realDonaldTrump has done to this nation; the negativity to this nation. https://t.co/cBqiPxrepy
This ought to be fun to watch! I wonder who will be the first GOPer to be investigated.  This makes for another soap opera to be played out here in America. Wonder what our allies will be saying? Will they be laughing over this? I am laughing because I know the GOP is corrupt! https://t.co/inqCVpgJON
2019 should prove to be very interesting. I am looking forward to all the subpoena's dropping into the Trump family members laps. That is going to be so fun to watch. More popcorn to buy as this soap opera plays out. If impeachment, trial and removal happens, I will be happy!!! https://t.co/uCTArv9GK4
This is what a #Grinch looks like: @realDonaldTrump and his warped mind. His heartless #shutdown at Christmas and now a pay freeze for federal workers for all of 2019 just shows how much of a #Grinch he is. He's a traitor to all Americans. A heartless jacka**. #ImpeachTrump https://t.co/sMJGMBpcWr
Trump is in for a nasty investigation into him and his family by the Democratic majority in the House. The Democratic House will pass a funding bill, which will be like the Senate version, then it will go to Trump for his signature. If it is vetoed, Congress has the 2/3 https://t.co/mYK1Cv0p8u
As it should be called: "The Racist Hate Wall" or better yet "Trump's Racist Hate Wall". Trump hasn't stop sinning since becoming president; it's gotten WORSE! The hate, bigotry, and racism has all gotten worse since 1/20/17. Time to #ImpeachTrumpNow https://t.co/HsSuFnQTS0
Conservatives will always go after women in political power of the Democratic party. They don't think that Democratic women can govern. That will change next year since the #GOP could not govern for 8 years in Congress and so far 2 years in the Executive Branch. https://t.co/kRcA3zJrKL
Thank God! Selling animals, that are not from a rescue organization, only helps breeders get away with being "puppy mills". Maybe this kind of law will spark some new wave across the nation to help rescue organizations place animals in loving homes. https://t.co/wIsT7mjQ76
This sure adds to Trump's problems even more. And he wants a dumb wall built? Then he does this act? No wonder he is an orange moron without brains! Glad the NJ AG did not trust Sessions; I would not either. Glad to know that Mueller and the FBI are investigating this crime https://t.co/JjzDBU4gqI
This is because that #GOP could care less what the president has been accused of. Even his supporters have basically said it is "okay" for our president to be accused of doing this and yet not hold him accountable. I say it is time to hold him accountable to these accusations. https://t.co/CGVL6zsxKT
I can't wait for the Democrats to take control of the House and become Trump's worse nightmare! I am sitting at the edge of my couch to see a check on Trump! I just can't wait to see the Democrats become that huge thorn in Trump's side that he will have a hard time pulling out! https://t.co/DBX1D49gMi
@theRealDawson83 @realDonaldTrump The problem with #MAGA, they will believe any lie that @realDonaldTrump spews out of his mouth regardless if it is proven 100% that he is lying. They tell us that we are the ones that are lying and that he is telling the truth; they don't know what truth is. #ImpeachTrumpandPence
@cwalisc @thehill And that check probably would have bounced from there to the moon and back again.
@realDonaldTrFan has NO idea the cost of a shutdown does to businesses. The loss of money with each shutdown means people are not paid. This guy is acting like a spoiled child throwing a temper tantrum rather than acting like the President of the United States of America. https://t.co/URAn3LJwxs
This excites me as well. Seeing the drop in Sean Hannity's ratings on Fox News is the best news anyone can get! I can't wait to see him implicated in the Cohen/Trump Law Triangle!!! The Trump Soap Opera Continues! https://t.co/FkW6FRFhOn
@foe_us I support a #GreenNewDeal as it will help face this climate crisis. It will also produce jobs which is something this country needs; MORE JOBS WITH A LIVING WAGE!
@USRepKCastor Amen to that! Failure is not an option. We have to tackle this climate crisis head on and win!
@NancyPelosi @USRepKCastor I applaud your choice of Chair of the new Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. It would seem that the #GOP do not care about the environment as much as the Democrats do.
@krassenstein Thank God for the Democrats! They care about the climate, our children's futures and things that the GOP does not care about. The #GOP only care about enriching themselves.
@_Jrlh_ @LindseyGrahamSC Nope. This young man's blood is on the GOP's hands. The GOP AND TRUMP are RESPONSIBLE! They could care less about people but themselves. Walls won't stop the flow of drugs into our country; people will find another way to import drugs into the USA. SAME WITH ILLEGALS!
@SunnyDayUSA1 @LindseyGrahamSC You are correct to say that it is inhumane to ignore human trafficking, sexual exploitation, deaths due to heroin overdose, etc. Problem is, the corrupt GOP won't put their money where their mouth is. They have two deaths on the hands of border security. Will this GOP do anything
@TinaPeiser @LindseyGrahamSC How HUMAN is it when OUR OWN CITIZENS MOLEST CHILDREN, RAPE WOMEN, KIDNAP AND KILL STUDENTS AT A UNIVERSITY? HOW HUMAN IS IT WHEN SOME OF OUR OWN CITIZENS WHO NEED FOOD STAMPS AND MEDICAID CANNOT GET IT BECAUSE THE GOP TAKES IT AWAY FROM THEM? THAT IS BEING HYPOCRITICAL.
If a Trump impeachment is now inescapable, it looks like the #GOP may have opened their eyes to what Trump has been doing to their party. It may be in the best interest of the party and their own interest to turn against the President. I hope it happens and soon! #ImpeachTrump https://t.co/Bq5oz9Fwur
Dear @realDonaldTrump,	Because of this shutdown, you need to pay for these furloughed federal workers rent payments not to mention mortgages. It is YOUR FAULT that these people won't be able to pay their rent/mortgage.	Sincerely,	America https://t.co/laSt1diP4w
This nutcase of a #sociopathinchief could not have won the 2016 election w/out any help from obroad! His our illegitimate president. Hillary is our legitimate president! At least she doesn't have so many lawsuits against her! https://t.co/YhodSVnFgR
You and me both! Amen to what you said!!!!!! #TrumpResign #ImpeachTrumpandPence https://t.co/TdKL6gfkcb

@LindseyGrahamSC To the GOP and Lindsey Graham: No Humanity for Human Decency, No Wall Money!
Now this tweet makes my morning start off on a great note! Thank you Gen. Barry McCaffrey for describing Trump's visit as "embarrassing" and "entirely inappropriate". And this is coming from a four-star general not some "businessman who thinks he knows more than the generals" https://t.co/g86qdFJiwW
I am sure we will be seeing some interesting tweets soon. Now what kind of angry tweets they will be is anyone's guess. https://t.co/Nb3IwYKgdg
Trump is a traitor to the United States. He will have company with Benedict Arnold. The worst president this country has ever had. Has polarized this nation and has kept it divided not unified it! #ImpeachTrumpNow #ResignTrump #Resistance  Trump is NOT doing the best for America. https://t.co/HgLImFF8YG
@ScottHech I wonder what the head of the Department of Homeland Security will do now that 2 immigrant children have died in the hands of Border Security. Will she even give a thought to outlawing child caging? I highly doubt it; this administration has no idea what humanity is.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Donald Trump keeps changing his mind on his wall partly to drive American's crazy. His supporters believe his lies. I don't believe him. His shutdown of the government just makes him look like a looser. Spend the $ to increase teacher pay, hire more teachers, build VA hospitals!
@ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump That is so true. The border wall is a complete waste of money and it won't solve illegal immigration. The $ could better be used to hire teachers, build VA hospitals, improve schools by renovating and increase teacher pay. Have Mexico PAY for that dumb WALL anyway.
@gloria18513108 @TerryLee_R @robreiner I don't need counseling. You do though. And I don't need anger management. I don't get testy unless I really need to. when i get someone who thinks they are "high and mighty" and "knows" it all, it drives me crazy. BTW; learn punctuation! Run-on sentences also drive me crazy.

@numerous_eggs @AnnieAsheFields @JakeSherman Ain't that the truth. Get rid of Ryan and then the veto can be overridden! Shutdown can come to a stop! Federal employees can go back to work with pay; get retro-pay for the work they have done w/out pay so far. Can't wait to see Ryan slither away from Washington, D.C. to WI
@bettycrackerfl Amen to that! I would love to see that. Let us hope it is done publicly so the nation can watch Mercer and his daughter wither under the TV lights and have them answer every Democrat question.
@reelmoments1 I am also looking forward to the accountability and responsibility after 2 years of the abuse of power &amp; rule of law committed by the treasonous president and complicit GOP. I look forward to see the Democratic House run the government and show the GOP how to run the government
@Shanghaijr16 Keep it up. You will have many resisters in laughter with tweets like that one. You will always have this one in laughter with a tweet like that. Thanks again!
I am looking forward to the accountability and responsibility after 2 years of abuse of power &amp;rule of law committed by the treasonous POTUS and complicit GOP. Looking forward to the Democratic House ending the #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/n0j1gD80Th
@ChrisJZullo And I can't wait to see Trump backed into a corner! The soap opera continues. Who needs a movie about this? We already have it live! I hope he signs a government funding bill and not vote to keep the #TrumpShutdown.
@cwalisc @thehill True. Trump is responsible for the Trump Shutdown. I hope he has the $ to pay those mortgages and rent for the federal employees that are working w/out pay during this shutdown. Can't wait to see him panic when the subpoenas begin to drop in his lap from the Democratic House 2019
Best tweet I could wake up to this morning! Seeing someone tell the #sociopath  POTUS what his role is had me in laughter! The orange #sociopathinchief is an utter moron! https://t.co/DXF9ZaByHN
Can't wait to see what the House Democrats are going to do! I've got a stack of microwave popcorn boxes to eat while I watch this soap opera continue to pay out. Will be interesting to see how the president will deal with this in six days! https://t.co/D0thBzbjZ3
@SallyYates01 @Emolclause Amen to that! The men and women of DOJ and the people of our country do deserve better! Trying to impeach Rod Rosenstein, for doing what he felt was in the best interest to have a special counsel do to this investigation, will be stupid and too political. A waste of time!
@krassenstein @kstreet111 the president doesn't care if those not getting paid because of the Trump Shutdown are Americans. I just hope that those who have rent and mortgages to pay will be able to pay it late w/out penalty.
As a citizen, I also call for the resignation of Donal J Trump as President of the United States. Please RT fellow citizens and pass it on. #Resist #Resistance  #TrumpResign #TheResistance @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/zQ5z3dUTSG

@AllardyceMaggie @jupitergirl @Bornabrit1 I would be the perfect gift to the nation to see everyone in the White House exiting in orange jumpsuits and in handcuffs!

@gloria18513108 @TerryLee_R @robreiner I don't get testy. Sure I am a leftist. Thank God I don't support a #sociopath like you do. you are the pathetic hypocrite. and don't tell me that you don't ever make a mistake because you are not perfect; ONLY GOD IS PERFECT!
@realDonaldTrump Probably because you conspired with a foreign enemy to defraud the 2016 election in the first place. You should have lost and Hillary Clinton should have won! She is not crooked; YOU ARE! YOUR CRIMES ARE BIGGER THAN WATERGATE! WE HAVE TRUMPGATE! #TrumpResgin
I think it shows that the Steele dossier has more truth in it. Tis the season for treason! Going to be a Great New Year to see Trump go down in flames! https://t.co/onp659f4qI
GOP &amp; @realDonaldTrump don't like the fact that it seems that the Steel Dossier is looking more &amp; more to be truthful! Having Cohen's cell phone bounce on towers in Prague makes me laugh at the stupidity of the GOP AND @realDonaldTrump. #ImpeachTrump #RemoveTrumpNow https://t.co/YZ6RVXeqjV
I can't stand talking with obvious Trumpsters who defend his disastrous policies. You don't believe in HUMANITY like some of us do. Trump has made our country so vulnerable to our enemies. #Resisters know the truth about Trump while Trumpsters do not! and I am not a DUMMY. https://t.co/67TU1XTb9n
This will not make Trump happy. Trump will be screaming "Not true! Everyone loves me. Everyone admires me. Everyone loves and admires Melania" "This can't be true". Smallest violin playing "Poor baby" to the #sociopathinchief https://t.co/tPHXKAR81q

I am so sure he will love this. I can just see the jaw hanging to the floor and Trump screaming "this can't be true! Everyone loves me and Melania!" https://t.co/JbkiLohiMr
Maybe Melanoma is wearing sunglasses in the dark to hide all those dark circles under her eyes from that long flight to Iraq. Or else she doesn't want people to see her make up mess up. https://t.co/4VPtTYVqoN
Gov. - elect DeWine will get one nasty-gram (polite though) asking him what he would do if he had to get an abortion for an emergency medical reason? He's one big jacka** who should have lost last year's election. He just doesn't care about women and their healthcare. https://t.co/Eper2PEUGl
It also raises doubts about the Trump administration's Drug Enforcement Agency's ability to help keep immigrant children alive during this time that ICE has them in their custody. Border security my ass. https://t.co/4gYRMUyElt
@TerryLee_R @robreiner So sorry for making a mistake. EVERYONE MAKES MISTAKES. Obviously, you think you don't make mistakes. So I got the countries mixed up, people do make mistakes. It is about time that the #sociopathinchief visit our troops in Iraq
@LovingL94558871 @dolphinDems1 No I am not! Listen to the news for once in your life. TWO CHILDREN HAVE DIED IN THE CARE OF ICE! That is SICKENING! YOU can read news articles that tell you about the raping of immigrants and molesting of children. It is you that is sick; I mean REALLY, REALLY SICK!
Gee, another punishment for women. These lawmakers in Ohio don't seem to think about medical emergencies as a reason for an abortion. They are going against Roe v Wade that the SCOTUS heard in the early 1970s; that ruling came down from SCOTUS TO PROTECT WOMEN AND abortion rights https://t.co/blISAqyek4
I always thought that Jesus told his disciples that "No one knows, however, when that day and hour will come -- neither the angels in heaven nor the Son, the Father alone knows".

@robreiner It finally takes two years for cadet bones spurs to visit troops in Iran at Christmas time. I always thought it was the responsibility of the commander-in-chief to visit his troops who are deployed during the holidays. I wonder if he will visit the troops next year or go to FL?
Amen to that. I do believe that we need love, justice, truth, voting rights, living wages, healthcare, care for the environment. We have to challenge these extreme militarism and Trump plus his enablers to understand this. https://t.co/f13UM9zR6o
If there is a stalemate in the Russia-US relationship, this should be highly interesting. Question remains, will Russia influence the 2020 Presidential election? Does Putin really care about his country, the world and the USA? Should be interesting to watch. https://t.co/HmkvOFeg8v
And that was one BIG lie. His supporters believed that lie hook, line and sinker. Mexico paying for this wall, my foot. It will be United States taxpayers who will be paying for it. #NoWallEver @realDonaldTrump doesn't know what the truth is and NEVER WILL. https://t.co/SiINiBUJAY
The look of Pence's face shows how much of a fool he made of himself this year. I sure wonder how many times he will make a fool of himself in 2019? Maybe more than 19 times. Will impeachment proceedings be drawn up against him? I bet he is probably worried about that. https://t.co/yMYX0YEKV6
@dolphinDems1 @LovingL94558871 One  child died in the "so-called" care of ICE and now another one dies in their hands. Why wouldn't they have their fun raping immigrants &amp; molesting children? If they can allow two children to die in their care, it would be so easy to molest &amp; rape. They don't give a DAMN!
@Chris54080214 @realDonaldTrump I am a feminist. I don't think my great-grandmother and my mother would have liked his nasty comment about women. Sorry you didn't like my comment. I am still pissed off at his comment. Trump has done enough crimes to get him impeached. I hope he is impeached and conviced

Be the best present for our nation! https://t.co/8ep1fP3bt4
@GeorgeTakei @Wellness4You13 Trump will never be able to "fix" it. He will be "all alone" because of his many members of the cabinet resigning. He chooses those who are the best ones to keep him in line and then they say "I quit". No wonder he cries "I am all alone". He brought it all upon himself.
#GOP cowards don't want to negotiate with Democrats because they are scared of losing their precious seats in both Houses.

@realDonaldTrump cheats at anything just to get his way. When he doesn't get it, he cries "foul" and "no fair" with his temper tantrums. Acts like a 2 year old. Nothing will save him now. People will have to finally see him for what he is: A FRAUD! #ResignTrump #impeachment https://t.co/z4in7NYzZP

Was Trump's real plan to pull troops from Syria and Afghanistan another order from his master -- Putin? I think it was since Trump is Putin's puppet! #TrumpResign or #impeachment time not to mention #Conviction time!

I think both are pretty bad. I sometimes return the comment with their same retort by also adding "you're hypocritical when all you do is mope around all day. don't tell me to smile when you can't even do that yourself. Look in the mirror and tell me who needs to smile." https://t.co/TiCh53qdkz

@ArchieJustice @InspiringU2 thank you for clearing that up. I think Biden would be a better choice though for President. With Hillary, she would go through another smear campaign that would do far more damage than the last one.
@dolphinDems1 #MeToo I don't like hearing about ICE child molesting and raping immigrants. They are disgusting pigs! They belong in a pig pen along with the head cheese (you know the POTUS) and his latest justice on SCOTUS. #BlueAmerica! #Resistance rules! We must fight for all women and kids
@ArchieJustice @InspiringU2 what is not true?
He's keeping the government shut down through Christmas because no one gave him what he really wanted for Christmas: his wall along the southern border. Now he crying like a little baby throwing a temper tantrum! Poor Baby, @realDonaldTrump! Get a grip on life! https://t.co/n0T5khD58N
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Oh you know, to make everyone's Christmas very lousy! That is why the government is shut down through Christmas. No one wants to give me what I wanted for Christmas -- my wall along the southern border. no one likes me! (crying like a baby)
Yup! Looking forward to the #2020Presidentialrace! I am all for a Biden/Harris ticket as I believe these two can clean up the mess this evil administration has done. They will regain our standing in the world and the respect we once had with our allies and throughout the world https://t.co/sbKr9VVwG2
@InspiringU2 Biden/Harris. 	I think these two could handle it. They will have to clean up the mess that this evil administration has done. They will regain our standing on the world stage and regain the respect we once held with our allies and throughout the world. #2020Presidentialrace
@InspiringU2 Biden can't be vice president again. How about Biden/Clinton? Those two could clean up the mess this current administration has done. These two could regain the respect we once held on the world stage with our allies and the world.

@realDonaldTrump better shell out the money to pay the rent and mortgages of those federal workers who are working without pay because of his #Shutdown. I would not want to go without a paycheck until he got his wall. #NoPaycheckNoWall  #ImpeachTrump https://t.co/i3Bfj0tH92
I don't the evil people in this administration will ever start to feel a bit bad about anyone dying in the custody of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. @realDonaldTrump will NEVER feel bad about that. He is PURE EVIL and his soul has been sold to the Devil! https://t.co/YTEuaSG2oL

I am not sure that the so-called "freedom" caucus what freedom for. I suppose they want freedom for themselves and enslavement for the rest of us.

White Evangelicals would have called for Obama's resignation if Obama had 5 children by 3 wives, had cheated on all 3 wives, one with a porn star after his wife just gave birth.

He could use this money for border security, such as screening more cars coming into our country and more people guarding are borders, it would stop the flow of the drugs that help get many people become attics to these drugs. A stupid wall won't stop this problem. https://t.co/8jLEN8y1mi
@MKGenest The kind who is currently in the White House. YIKES!
This all adds up to @realDonaldTrump's #chaos in the White House and #Incompentence as president. He has our stock market tumbling and the government in a shutdown that will last into the New Year. https://t.co/Ba2Z7Jfju4
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Just wait until he is in solitary confinement when he really will be "all alone"! I am sure we all will be happy when that happens! I know that I will be happy when that happens.
@krassenstein Merry Christmas	I hope it is the last one with Trump as President.
I am done being nice to Trump Supporters as well. How about everyone else? https://t.co/U7O3nMtats
@HillaryClinton Merry Christmas to you and to your family! Merry Christmas to all my twitter followers as well! May you have the best New Year in 2019!
#MerryChrismas I would rather spend Christmas with @BarackObama because he and his family are far more of a family. They care about family and friends and the people who work for the Federal Government. who would others rather spend Christmas with? @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama https://t.co/UXK39888RO
@WTFizHappening @FredFriendly7 @realDonaldTrump This is NOT following the teachings of Jesus when we hate each other and put humans in concentration camps. I just hope it gets through to the president to understand what being a Christian is that what he is doing is NOT God's work; it is the Devil's work. #TrumpResignNOW
Amen to that. Life and morals over money every day of the week is what I will take as well. Of course, the Trump Crime Family will take money over life and morals. After all, Melania calls herself "Your Queen" in her Christmas letter to America. Is that using good morals? Nope. https://t.co/WWyfCxfVgV
Great picture of our #incompetent #sociopathinchief! Crying like a 2 year old baby who seems not get what he wants. Here's the smallest violin playing "poor baby" for @realDonaldTrump . LOL. https://t.co/iUFeYUvkuc
I believe that Trump is destroying this country purposely because the idiot listens to Putin AND his right wingers! The #sociopath is #incompetent and has turned his administration into total #Chaos! He has given this country #ChaosChristmas! https://t.co/aqORCpaLpL
@realDonaldTrump You are NOW responsible of the RETURN of ISIS! The Iran Nuclear Deal was a good deal but you were stupid enough to pull out of it just like you were to pull out of the Paris Agreement. Guess you like carbons in your drinking water and in the air you breathe. I don't.
@EdKrassen Have a very Merry Christmas!
@realDonaldTrump says "It's a very scary time for men, Because women can vote them out of office." He even "it is a disgrace." That tells me he wants to repeal the 19th Amendment. #feminists ought to be alarmed with this. My great-grandmother was an original suffragett! #Resist!
Melania Trump just sent out her letter to America. In it she says she's writing a memoir called "Becoming" -- coping Michelle Obama's memoir title! Melania end it with "Your Queen". #feminists should be mad as hell!
@mmpadellan Congratulations are due to both Harvard and David Hogg. David has done more for America than those Republicans in Congress since they took control in 2010. I can't wait for him to turn 35 as I will vote for him in a New York minute!
@ladyj461 @mmpadellan You are so correct. David has done more for this country in the past year then this current disgusting Republican party in Congress since 2010 when they took control. Proud of you, David!
Four years in prison for Cohen would be a piece of cake, compared to what Trump would get. Trump would get a life sentence in prison. Cohen, being a big threat to Trump's presidency, is the best gift to America! Thank you, Michael Cohen! https://t.co/GndLG8WwfO
@EdKrassen I wonder where James Mattis' approval rating is among the active duty Military personnel now that he resigned from the administration. Nice to see his rating is way above Trump's rating. That makes my Christmas shine bright. Bet it makes Trump's Christmas not shine bright.
@robreiner @PassionFruit62 I agree with you. A wall should be built around Trump, Whitaker, Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh (all of them inside that wall) and the rest of America. No one, not even the President, is above the law. #ResignNow
Amen to that! Maybe we should even pull Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh before Congress and have them explain why they seem to give Trump his "marching" orders. Those two were not elected and should have a wall around them. Trump needs one between him and American people! #Resign! https://t.co/9zpeDLKITj
@d1Vinman @realDonaldTrump The money @realDonaldTrump wants for that stupid wall could be used to increase teacher pay across the nation, fixing the public education system, clothe the needy, shelter the homeless, feed the needy, give aid and comfort to the ill and infirmed. That is God's work.
@jpavlovic801 @mog7546 I totally agree. the guy sure has no idea how to read. I read it and understood what Sec. Mattis was telling Trump. Guess you can't teach him how read and understand anything at his age.
@Mike6162 @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump says that Mexico was going to PAY for that stupid wall; guess what -- that ain't gonna happen. United States TAXPAYERS WILL PAY FOR IT. MAJOR LIE FROM YOUR PRESIDENT. HE AIN'T MY PRESIDENT.
IT ALL ADDS UP TO: #Chaos! #ChaosChristmas! #TrumpShutdown is all juvenile behavior by @realDonaldTrump. He won't listen to anyone who doesn't have the same ideals. Many vacant seats at the first of the year. Makes me worried with this #Sociopath's administration. YIKES! https://t.co/obIBLtRByd
A Republicans representative has the guts to tweet that Trump wanted the shutdown! Common sense doesn't reign at the White House; #Chaos and #Incompetence reign at the White House. Common sense will reign again once Trump is out! 3 shutdowns in one term; YIKES! #TrumpResign https://t.co/s6n8uJcYaj
@realDonaldTrump better learn how to read a resignation letter! Even if it is critical of him, he needs to learn how to read. Then again, can you teach a 70+ year old #Sociopath how to read and understand? Probably not. #TrumpResign https://t.co/2XTPur8cf1
ENOUGH OF THE LIES ALREADY, @realDonaldTrump! You have told 7,546 lies in 700 days as president! That is quite enough! #Resign already! https://t.co/6XC982jZme
If @realDonaldTrump feels "totally and completely abandoned" by complaining that no one is one his side, I have the smallest violin playing "poor baby" for him.

@HillaryWarnedUs Thoughts and prayers for you and his family. May he rest in the loving arms of God.
@prog_mustard @stucam7771 Thanks. @realDonaldTrump must be #Impeached! His supporters drive me crazy especially those right wingers on Fox &amp; Friends and talk show radio hosts that have him change his mind big time. It's like they run the his administration and not that #sociopathinchief. #TrumpResign
@EricHolder @rhonmhon8 Amen to that. I hope that Whitaker can stay independent of Trump. The DOJ is supposed to be independent of the president anyway. Let's hope the DOJ stands their ground and does their duty by the Constitution.
I blame the GOP and Donald Trump for this #TrumpChristmasShutdown which affects many people and their families. A very #MerryMullerChristmas to the GOP and @realDonaldTrump (spoken sarcastically). https://t.co/sZ1psgjIFF

Great post! I would rather be donating $ to feed the poor, shelter the homeless, clothe those in need, help our Veterans in need, welcome immigrants, give aid to the ill and infirmed.

@realDonaldTrump is not keep his campaign promise that Mexico would pay for this stupid wall. Why shut down the government if Mexico is supposed to pay for this wall? I believe Trump lied to us again! #TrumpChristmasShutdown is keeping him at the White House for once! Poor baby. https://t.co/0UG34H53dx
@ChuckGrassley is calling this the Schumer Shutdown. It's the #TrumpChristmasShutdown! This #GreedOverPeople is embarrassing to the USA! They play with people's lives as though we are toys to be thrown about. Nevermind we have bills to pay, food to buy, rent &amp; mortgages to pay https://t.co/n7lnVkOnkW
@ChuckGrassley It is NOT Schumer Shutdown. It's the #TrumpChristmasShutdown as well as the #GOPChristmasShutdown! You can't govern! Our deficit is in the trillions and you complain if a democratic president asks for $ on certain things. Why not stand up to Trump for once? #GreedOverPeople!!
Ain't that the truth. Glad my family members are Democrats. Have many friends who are Dems as well. Not sure if they are #Resisters though. It is sad that there are some people who still support this #sociopathinchief. This Trump era is a very sad era indeed. Thoughts? https://t.co/R4jppXKG8J
@dolphinDems1 You are so correct. #Resistance is the only decency left. Evangelicals and Trump are the devil. They think it is ok to rape and molest children, lie and cheat &amp; then have the gall to call us "liars". At least we don't think it is ok to rape and molest children. #Resistance rules
So true! Thank you for reminding his supporters what @realDonaldTrump said on National TV. @realDonaldTrump supporters are so blind to the fact that his #TrumpChristmasShutdown has hurt many people and their families. #MerryMuellerChristmas,@realDonaldTrump! You will be impeached https://t.co/CTOV1AjVt9
@funder @KassandraSeven Glad you like the #TrumpResigns and #TrumpResign. Here are a couple more: #TrumpsShutdown #TrumpChristmasShutdown #TrumpCrimeFamily That is what is trending. Another is trending #Chaos and #incompetent
that's my Christmas wish as well! I don't want to see another Trump tweet during Christmas. It may bring the Dow down drastically that peoples' 401k will become what I have always called a 201k. https://t.co/hCfLrPwafv
I wonder if the Nevada legislature, with its female-majority, will be able to show to our national government how to GOVERN! Sometimes females do better at governing than men and vice versa. This should be interesting. https://t.co/QEH8TDuheg
The money that is being "funded" for this stupid wall could be used to provide drinking water to the residents of Flint, MI; to fix their water system; clothe &amp; feed the homeless of Flint; help rebuild the city by giving them thousands of $. #NoWaterNoWall #Impeach45 https://t.co/TOLGO53Gmo
This looks to be a book to be read by not only #Resisters but by @realDonaldTrump and his supporters. Don't know if tRump and supporters will understand it, but I think all #Resisters will understand it. I plan to buy it and read it! https://t.co/Mwb36H9UkE
Is this how we treat children who were torn from their parent's arms and placed into internment camps? Is this how we treat their needs? #FireNielsen as she is a #HumanRightsAbuser just like tRump is. They are committing #HumanTrafficking and #HumanRightsViolations #TrumpResign
And I can't wait for January! When the Democrats walk into the House next month, things will begin to change for the better! Good thing Democrats KNOW how to govern. GOP can slither under the rocks they came from. With more evidence against Trump, we're in for a bumpy ride! https://t.co/DwxkgzPJlF
@realDonaldTrump @JeffreyGuterman Unfortunately, Mr President, you are making it feel as though the United States has no president. There is something called checks and balances for all 3 branches of government. You, the Senate and the House have to work together to keep this government working.
#TrumpChristmasShutdown sure tells me that we are NOT great again. I have always thought of America as being GREAT anyway! We never had to make her great again. Trump is off his rocker when he says "Make America Great Again". He's made it worse! https://t.co/pAV5mHenk9
I don't believe Evangelicals actually believe in the teachings of Jesus Christ.  If they did, they would actually act on those teachings. I just don't see them doing that especially if they support Trump and his ideology. Jesus condemns bigotry, racism, and hatred. https://t.co/rLKREmUPV0
I would say that the majority of #Resisters have a higher IQ than  @AnnCoulter so called IQ. I know my IQ is higher than hers. https://t.co/PJd3xQEUeI
This would be a perfect movie! Probably would bring in the money for that stupid wall. I wonder who would play the "Ghost of Christmas future"? It would be fun to see Trump being shown sitting all alone in a cell, pale &amp; bald and rocking slowly! doubt Trump would like it. I would https://t.co/g95ItAKbVZ
It is so very true. #Chaos and #incompetence reign at the White House. It did not have to happen. The #TrumpChristmasShutdown did not have to happen if Trump has used the organ between his ears to compromise with the Senate. https://t.co/qtXuJ3ep8f
@SenWhitehouse @RepBonnie @realDonaldTrump Yep. Chaos and incompetence reign in the White House! This #TrumpChristmasShutdown did not have to happen if @realDonaldTrump would have compromised with the Senate.
@realDonaldTrFan You are the immature one. Your #TrumpChristmasShutdown makes you the #Grinch.  Your wall won't keep people from entering illegally. You are the stupid one. The people of the USA are NOT your personal toys to be thrown about. We have bills, rent, food, and mortgages to pay for.
@stucam7771 I totally agree with you. I am tired of Trump supporters saying the same thing. I remember what the Republicans did to Bill Clinton and how they stubbornly blocked Obama. They are hypocrites.
Trump supporters are hypocrites. They say one thing and completely do another.  These same people love to cut down the good Obama did and yet praise what Trump does. Trump defrauded the 2016 election which is a crime. his supporters are blind to that. https://t.co/es85p5A1XE
I would rather not have a wall at the southern border. We can allow these people to come into our country on a work visa, and pay taxes while they are here. In that way, they can begin their process of legally becoming a citizen of this country.Must we be this hateful? https://t.co/OBv77Z0KDa
Trump would turn his back on a pregnant Mary and Joseph if they showed up at Mar-a-Logo on Christmas Eve. He is a #Grinch and will always be one. https://t.co/eqE4xtnOpo
@thistallawkgirl Trump would probably turn his back on them like he does on people who live paycheck to paycheck, are in poverty, etc. Trump is a #Grinch
@MaryLTake @mjfree @realDonaldTrump Any POTUS who does the will of a dictator has no place in our country. Any POTUS who uses the people of the USA as his personal toys to be thrown about and to treat the military as toy soldiers has no business being POTUS. We are talking about peoples lives, paying bills, eating!
Amen to that! The people of the USA are just that: people and NOT toys.Our military are NOT toy soldiers to be played with. ANY POTUS who thinks it is okay to do a dictator's bidding HAS NO place in our country. #TrumpChristmasShutdown2018 https://t.co/t99Wel2I6C
His so called "America First" went down the drain. He puts himself first and forget the country. He has kept this country in such disarray. He will never understand what it takes to be POTUS. #TrumpChristmasShutdown https://t.co/u1OPDfNaPj

@thejohnsloman @GeorgeTakei It's ALL OF THE ABOVE! He is #PutinsPuppet and head of the #TrumpCrimeFamily . It is also because of this #TrumpChristmasShutdown2018  plus the #TrumpChaos in the White House. Trump needs to resign NOW! For the sake of saving our nation, #TrumpResign!
God love Bette Midler! She says it well when she reminds us what #Individual1 is so proud to own: this government shutdown! #TrumpShutdown #TrumpResign #TrumpTemperTantrum https://t.co/0Xd4ik7wRO
@realDonaldTrump Your shutdown of the government will show your lack of leadership. You can't control your party and get people in a room. This shutdown will show that you are weak! The resisters will know this and will be laughing at you since we know you are an illegitimate president.

One more @realDonaldTrump rant on Twitter and the stock market will drop drastically! I am glad my 401k is out of the stock market and into an IRA. By now, I would have lost quite a lot of my 401k than I did when 9/11 happened in 2001. Let's hope for no more rants from Trump https://t.co/fQXdEXjXhJ
@ida_skibenes @davidb734 Trump's supporters don't know who actually needs the money. Their brains (if they have any) are fried or have turned into mush. Christmas to them is the "give me this; give me that". They forget the rule of "it's better to give than to receive".  Trumpters are the Antichrist!
Yep. America is witnessing this even if this SORE LOSER'S supporters won't see it. We are witnessing the demise of the American ideals of our Founding Fathers because of this SORE LOSER. #TrumpResign #TrumpShutdown #TrumpMeltdown #NotMyPresident https://t.co/JEEpW8E58v

@theRealDawson83 Merry Christmas. Everyone is welcome to the resistance.  We resisters have to remain supportive of each other as that is what makes us stronger against this tyranny that Trump has brought to the United States and to the world.
@Took8Took @realDonaldTrump Isn't that the truth. One can only hope he will refrain from another Twitter rant that really crashes the stock market. Unfortunately, I have a funny feeling he will do another Twitter rant that will crash the stock market. He'll be the one to blame for another depression

Jesus Christ would give immigrants the shirt off his back, welcome them with open arms and would tear down a wall. Christianity in America is DEAD! It died in America the minute this society went 24/7. It is the toilet with the Trump garbage! https://t.co/7jO5QM4U2M
@EdKrassen The "so called" Christians don't follow the teachings of Jesus Christ. What you said about Jesus tearing down a wall and giving immigrants the shirt off of his back is true. Christianity doesn't exist in America anymore. It is in the toilet along with all the Trump garbage
So true! Justice Ginsburg is one tough cookie! Glad she could vote to uphold the block on Trump's bigoted asylum ban. We need to get that bigoted illegitimate POTUS out of office now! https://t.co/IgiHuOxT9G

@ChuckGrassley Why you need to have money for a stupid border wall at Christmas time is so DUMB. This current GOP is an embarrassment to Lincoln, MY RELATIVE! This wall will not keep illegals out of our country. They will still be able to get into our country. Can the GOP understand it?
@JShugster @JeffFlake Sen Flake is a TRUE REPUBLICAN who has values. the current GOP has NO values. BTW, Democrats are not fools and neither is Sen Flake. Apparently, you are the fool though.
@CharlesEDean Well you sure don't know anything about conspiring with a foreign country (who by the way is an enemy of the United States) to DEFRAUD an election; THAT IS A CRIME which will land Trump in prison!
Doubt @realDonaldTrump would like seeing #TrumpResign on Twitter every day. I love seeing it every day! I know we #Resisters just love posting #TrumpResign every day to make a point in hopes that he will see it one of these days. Better call him and tell him to look on Twitter https://t.co/BbWslgrzMM
@muttratt Think he will like all the #TrumpResign that he sees? Probably not. I know that we #Resisters love seeing #TrumpResign in every tweet we see every day! I know I do.
I heard that on the news. He did say that he would be proud to own the #TrumpShutdown. It is time #TrumpResign https://t.co/S4Smeu5bsC
Agreed! #TrumpResign #TrumpShutdown #TrumpTemperTantrum #TrumpMeltdown https://t.co/pT6Vg71kxL
@NLPChris @WhiteHouse I think you meant "two years" rather than "two terms". Justice will prevail and you are correct that Boxing Day will be a good day for #TrumpResign much less a #TrumpShutdown or better yet a #TrumpMeltdown
@BF_TheFish Thank you for the evening laugh. I agree with you. It would make enough money to pay for that stupid wall which more than likely won't work anyway. People still have ways to come into this country illegally! A border wall ain't gonna stop them from coming into our country.

Thank you! This is so very true! Trump has not only turned the White House into one of his bankrupt casinos, he also has turned it into a nursery for the biggest baby: himself! We need that Trump baby balloon that the city of London has during his visit this year! Perfect for WH! https://t.co/Qzggw7dEOt
Guess this means that Trump will be SCROOGE to all Federal employees this Christmas. Am I glad that McConnell doesn't have the votes for nuclear option. Makes my evening! https://t.co/G7riaAlfJq
GOP Senators, and most especially @senatemajldr , just stood up to Trump and told him that they are rejecting the "Nuclear Option" to push through wall funding! Thank God! I can't get over this news! https://t.co/M587y1NFsI
@realDonaldTrump @SteveDaines Nuclear option to "win" this Border Security is NOT an option. What is an option is the Senate filibuster that helps to bring both parties together. Using the nuclear option just helps to divide parties and doesn't bring both parties to the table to work together.
Seems to be the only Republican senator left that has guts to not vote for this option. Senator Flake has my respect for saying that he will not vote for the nuclear option. He's the only one left who has values. No one else in the #RepublicanParty has values. https://t.co/6MPlqgPP7A
@JeffFlake Thank you, Sen Flake. Deploying the nuclear option is not going to help matters. The only thing that will help will be the Senate filibuster. I wish Sen. McConnell would not use the nuclear option for this. Thank you for being a true republican senator who has values.

@BatmanResist @jomareewade @realDonaldTrump @ScarletAvengers @LiberalVenom @CatWomanResists @ElastigirlVotes @CyrusToulabi @anti_orange1 @jacksnowknows @Realityshaken @TheSWPrincess @realDonaldTrump has done more damage to our country.

This guy does not seem to understand that Trump told Pelosi and Schumer that Trump would be "PROUD" TO SHUTDOWN THE GOVERNMENT. Sure, Schurmer is the leader of the Democrats in the Senate. It will be a Trump Shutdown; not a Democrat shutdown. Trumpsters can pay for the wall. https://t.co/r19W7y0716
@Pappytx1 @JamesMSama @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer You don't listen to what YOUR own president tells Pelosi and Schumer at a meeting do you? He told them  "I will be PROUD to shut down the government". I know that Schumer is the leader of the Democrats in the Senate; just like I know he is Senate minority leader.
@TeaPainUSA Too many Trumpters and #Individual1 believe in "Democrat Shutdown" all because #Individual1 doesn't want to accept his OWN responsibility in this. #Individual1 is a coward to accept his own responsibility and his posse of supporters are blind as hell!
I have more of a brain than the Trumpeters. The Trumpeters don't get it right. They are racist, bigoted and hateful. Theses people want to take us back to a time where we treated people of color in a negative manner and women as second class citizens. You are an embarrassment! https://t.co/N5GgXYJHGp
@JayRodge66 @HillaryClinton I hope and pray each day that this current #RepublicanParty will open their eyes and see that their actions are making our nations safety/security at risk each and every day. We have to fight the #RussianOligarchs in order to regain our nations security.
Trump DOES NOT KNOW more about ISIS than the generals do. He is not at the front lines! Nor did he EVER fight for his country! He has NO idea what being commander in chief means. The generals KNOW MORE ABOUT ISIS. They are the ones who are putting their ass on the line NOT Trump https://t.co/aHlOGhlM8F
@eatbees @wesley_jordan That painting offended me especially since it included a picture of a relative of mine. I know that I probably should not have been offended. That painting really should have shown just Nixon through Trump.
@Garymon12 @ScottPresler Whatever the tweet was, I am glad it gave you that belly laugh. You must be one of those delusional Trumpers who can't see all those crimes that Trump has committed since Day 1. You won't accept that this nut case is Putin's puppet and has put this nation's security in danger.
@Pappytx1 @JamesMSama @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer NO, you dumb-dumb. Schumer is IS Minority leader in the Senate! McConnell is Majority Leader in the Senate. Dems ONLY CONTROL THE HOUSE! Trump told Pelosi and Schumer that "HE WOULD BE PROUD TO SHUTDOWN THE GOVERNMENT" so it would be a TRUMP SHUTDOWN! UNDERSTAND NOW. NUT CASE?
@concept268 @Garymon12 @ScottPresler @realDonaldTrump You trumpers are not intelligent. I want border security but not at the sacrifice of humanitarian actions. I suppose you so called Christians have NO idea what being a Humanitarian is. Yes, I am a liberal and DAMN proud of it. You are an EMBARRASSMENT TO THE LINCOLN PARTY!
@HillaryClinton @JayRodge66 @HillaryClinton would have made a FAR better president. She would not put our country's security at risk. Her actions would been strong with her knowledge of world affairs. This POTUS does not know anything about foreign affairs and has put our nation's security at grave risk.
The Democrats won't "own" this shut down. #Individual1 will own this shutdown. Does anyone remember him telling Pelosi and Schumer that #Individual1 would be "proud" to shutdown the government"? Trump Shutdown! https://t.co/A0I7u0uVTS
@TeaPainUSA #Individual1 may say that Democrats "own the shutdown", but does he remember telling Pelosi and Schumer that he would be proud to shutdown the government if he didn't get the funding for his border wall? It won't be the Democrats "owning" the shutdown. It will be #Individual1.
Besides saying that statement, He has just made this Christmas very lousy for the children of those federal employees. Trump has zero heart or caring for anyone BUT HIMSELF. https://t.co/bHv3nVPGT3
This is where Trumpers have placed us. They are the ones who are so DELUSIONAL to believe that we are still the superpower we once were. They don't see China and Russia as adversaries, but as allies. They see our current allies as enemies. We are in harms way with these Trumpers https://t.co/Tbpzs6BONb
Yep! The Authoritarian Trump family will make the United States just like Nazi Germany. It will be a shame to see that happen. Time to get rid of this Crime Family and LOCK THEM UP FOR GOOD. https://t.co/KAvHFQbIOI
@VorholtNuthouse @ScottPresler For one: CONSPIRING with a foreign government to DEFRAUD an election so as to become president. HE IS AN ILLEGITIMATE PRESIDENT! He DOES the bidding of PUTIN. He ADORES our enemies and turns our ALLIES into our enemies. Get out of YOUR DELUSIONAL WORLD! #Resistance #ResignNow
@CharlesEDean @ScottPresler I am a #Resister NOT a Trumper. I do not live in a delusional world. I would be dancing in the streets ONCE THAT #sociopathinchief is locked up in federal prison for life.
Donald Trump's "highway" that would be named after him would be one that lead to a federal prison. Which one federal prison that would be is anyone's guess. So any highway to that particular federal prison would be named for Trump. It may even be named "Trump Crime Family" https://t.co/UbC0szMeom
The Attorney General, much less the acting Attorney General, serves the American people. He or She does not serve the president. The DOJ is separate from the president. https://t.co/RNnkvWAOAt
Out of this list of people: this person who is corrupt is TRUMP! He hasn't kept this country safe. He's made us sitting ducks for more attacks foreign governments. He is Putin's puppet and will do anything that Putin asks of him. No wonder Mattis is leaving Trump's cabinet. https://t.co/Q7JNMghDDO
I wonder how @senatemajldr will feel with the new Secretary of Defense that the #sociopathinchief will name to replace Mattis. Senate Republicans will go down in history as traitors to the United States just like Trump. https://t.co/3Qri7TFzf7
I totally agree with this comment. If this current GOP doesn't speak up to Trump, we won't be alive much longer if they keep following Trump. We are at CODE RED! It is time for the 25th Amendment NOW! The senate Republicans have to vote to convict this idiot-in-chief to save us. https://t.co/n9h02wOxnc
@LindseyGrahamSC Why do you have to always blame Democrats for everything? Why can't you see the damage your party and Trump is doing to this country? Do you hate Democrats so much that YOU are unwilling to compromise? Is that why you are so willing to make this Christmas so lousy for children?
The senate doesn't have the votes to pass this "spending" bill. This will make for a very crummy Christmas for the children of federal employees. Trump is a SCROOGE! I even told Don, Jr that and I hope Don, Jr realizes he also is a SCROOGE! https://t.co/TE55O4SNeZ
@DonaldJTrumpJr And to avoid a government shutdown, which your father said he would be "happy" to shutdown, they approved something they didn't want to. The Senate doesn't have the votes to pass. Your father gave the children of federal employees a LOUSY CHRISTMAS. Your father is a SCROOGE!
If this happens, maybe we should call for an investigation into possible "vote-flipping" machines during the 2016 elections in every state! the GOP cheats to win every election be it state, local or national. Enough is enough! https://t.co/KTShALb9MR
Our only hope to restore our world standing, regaining our credibility as a shining beacon of light for equality, being humanitarians to everyone and not abandoning our allies is to nominate and elect @RepBetoORourke in 2020! We need honor, civility and integrity again! https://t.co/lLdikHAzJm
@mmurraypolitics Another reason to get this #sociopathinchief out of the White House! Our world standing is in the toilet thanks to him and we are ever close to waging war that could end this world that we all call home. This idiot is off his rocker!
#sociopathinchief is plunging us into chaos. He is also plunging us into another depression. It may be worse that the Great Depression of the 1930s! What our parents lived through will probably be nothing compared to what we will be living through. https://t.co/hjJPF19Vii
@JamesMSama @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer Of course this would not be a Democratic shutdown. It would be a Trump shutdown! He just made Christmas become a lousy one for the children of federal employees. The president needs to resign now! He's deceitful and hateful. No compassion at Christmas time children. #TrumpResig
This would not be a Democrat shutdown. It would be a Trump shutdown. He would be the one to make this Christmas a lousy one for the children of those federal employees. He needs to resign now! #TrumpResignNOW #TrumpResign https://t.co/HqEsIwRLdK
@ScottPresler So much for you understanding that "your" president HAS committed treason against the United States! Your understanding is so limited and narrow. Once you see your illegitimate president taken down and thrown into prison, you will have to eat those words in your tweet.
If we only get rid of Trump and Pence becomes president, I am not so sure how effective he could be as president. I don't see him being reelected in 2020 should he become president. Let's hope both are out of the White House soon! https://t.co/llG3Wpfq20
I remember that quote that Reagan said. I was in college when he said it and when that wall finally came down! Reagan did not like walls. He sure would not like hearing about this wall our #sociopathinchief wants to build. https://t.co/DgaZyakftJ
I will hate to see General Jim Mattis resign. He and General Kelly were the only ones who could keep this #sociopathinchief "grounded" until lately. Now we have lost General Kelly and are about to lose General Mattis because of this #sociopathinchief. Trump has put us in DANGER! https://t.co/8MJUbgVLze
Ain't that the truth. And now he's telling the federal employees to tell their children "there will be no Christmas this year". isn't that what we all call "SCROOGE"? what more could we ask for in a #sociopathinchief? #Resist #TrumpResignNOW https://t.co/n4htrZS9mq
The new GOP was made worse with Trump. What was once called the Lincoln Party and was a party that was a little more honest than it is today (or when Reagan brought religion into it back in the 1980s) is now a party of SHAME. https://t.co/45M32rCNpG
@eatbees @wesley_jordan If you are saying that President Lincoln would be happy with this new GOP you are sadly mistaken. I don't even think Teddy Roosevelt would even be happy with this new GOP. This new GOP only got worse after religion was first brought in by Reagan back in the 1980s. It's worse now!
Best news for those for those women who were sexually assaulted by Harvey Weinstein! #MeToo https://t.co/HDSKNdV60I
I'd hate to see his supporters try to remember what happened to the Stock Market recently especially if their 401K took a tumble! I would hate to see them try to remember the other things and see Trump lose in 2020 if he is not impeached and removed from office. They would cry! https://t.co/2opaT6blST
All of this, today, is making my Christmas brighter and brighter each day! It is also making my New Year get off to a good start. I am so glad to be part of this resistance to see Trump fall to his demise. https://t.co/6PsDiVokEP
Let's see, 40 thousand MAGA idiots have already funded $2.5M for the wall. The Trumps can donate the other $1.3 million to donate for that stupid wall. Since Trump has spent that much on his golfing to date, he can spend that much on his stupid wall rather than asking us to pay. https://t.co/DBYxWpPGpH
None of the above. https://t.co/WDeaYyVjxy
I would have to say that Ivanka Trump has the most annoying voice. The next is her husband Jared Kushner. Mark Zuckerberg comes in third. Though Zuckerburg and Kushner could change places. Anyone of them could have the most annoying voice. https://t.co/1DfHfm93C8
@realDonaldTrump Why don't you ask your supporters to fund your border wall? I am very sure that they will put up the 5 million that you want to build that wall. You use tear gas against children and mothers. Not very Christian of you. Do you believe in the teachings of Jesus Christ? I doubt it.
Sarah Huckabee Sanders belongs in a zoo although far away from all the animals people want to see. I think she would be some kind of rodent that the public would not want to visit. https://t.co/Ay9LZbCgqJ
@wesley_jordan I can see Eisenhower and Lincoln shaking their heads wondering what happened to the Grand Old Party. This current GOP is an embarrassment to Eisenhower and Lincoln. I know I could never kneel before Trump and pledge my undying loyalty to him. That goodness for being a Dem!
First and foremost is to get rid of bumpstocks! That helps with killing as many people as a person can do. We have do away with that. We should not arm our teachers. We need to put $ into mental health treatment. People who are mentally unstable should not own a gun. https://t.co/b08N5lOEbi
@MrsRabbitResist You said what I have been thinking and for some reason could never type. Thanks for writing it. Made me feel really good.
Trump is in bed with Putin. He will side with Putin over U.S. Intel all the time. The GOP will never believe it even if Trump actually admits to it. If the GOP ever believes it, millions of resisters will probably faint with surprise. https://t.co/8uK2rXBC1S
@DonaldJTrumpJr Don't care to "welcome to your world". You have enough people who do not like what your father is doing to our country as he is uncaring and sure does not live a Christian life. If he did, he would follow the teachings of Jesus Christ. None of you lead a Christian life.
I love this prediction! It will be a big relief to all resisters to see these two gone! I personally will be happy to see Pelosi as president. Would love to see her win in 2020. Half a dozen GOP senators being implicated in crimes! Dems to crucify the party of Trump/Putin! https://t.co/cun64Phkrf
@PamKeithFL I love your prediction! Do you predict that Pelosi will win in 2020? I also can see a half a dozen GOP senators being implicated in crimes; one of those being @senatemajldr . What do you think? I can also see the Democrats crucifying the party of Trump/Putin.
@SenMajLdr will aways object to anyone trying to pass a bill to protect the Mueller investigation. @senatemajldr needs his head checked to see if there is any brain damage. We need Mueller to be protected so this investigation can move forward to a finish. America deserves it. https://t.co/aXMVJXpVaH
Will be buying this book very shortly. It looks very interesting. We in America sure don't know how to treat people of color with respect.

Probably time to take down my facebook account. I wonder if Congress should be calling Facebook's CEO before them again with this new revelation. I don't think Zuckerburg really gives a damn if people's accounts are sold to tech giants without our consent. https://t.co/pWAIJdHjFT
@AllardyceMaggie @jupitergirl @Bornabrit1 I would like that too. Then we can deal with the actual sentencing for treason. I would not care what that sentencing would be; that is after he is FORCED to tell the nation why he committed treason against our nation; cheated/lied and everything else in between. Accountablility
@theRealDawson83 Post whatever you want to post. No one should be telling you what to say. That goes for resisters and trumpers. I will not judge you or tell you to shut up. Everyone has the right to post whatever they want to post.
Post whatever you want to post. Forget what others tell you. No one should be judging you simply because you are Canadian and not a resister. We have resisters in the United States and Trumpers in the United States. Post whatever you want to post. I won't judge you. https://t.co/7zRfD1W7jJ
Supreme Court justices should be bound by the same code of conduct as other judges. Justice Kavanaugh's 83 judical misconduct complaints should be heard and should not have been dismissed. Our judicial system needs to be reformed! https://t.co/x0nEfYx2e4
Another reason to put into Mueller's report that Trump conspired with Russia to defraud an election to win so as to become president. He's is Putin's Puppet and we all know it. @RudyGiuliani knows this but refuses to admit that what Trump did was wrong and is a crime! https://t.co/PMXxHeXskh
Seems like the southern states don't care if a woman is sexually assaulted by a state legislator, a candidate running for national office, or any state office, etc. It makes no sense to me.

I can't wait to see what kind of sentence Flynn will get at the postponement sentencing hearing. I really liked what the judge told him yesterday when he told Flynn that he had sold out his country.

This is really funny. One person says Flynn was "entrapped" and now his lawyer says he was not "entrapped" by the FBI. I can just see what Sarah Huckabee Sanders will say at her next briefing about Flynn and the postponement of his sentencing. I will be laughing at her next one. https://t.co/nYyWe1eYNh
Sarah Huckabee Sanders tells every lie that Trump tells her to say to the American people when she goes before the cameras at her briefings. Saying that the FBI "ambushed" Flynn is totally wrong. Flynn committed those crimes for Trump to help him get into the presidency. https://t.co/P6qigs7Btd
Republicans are going to have to face facts that things are not looking good for the party as well as Trump. These Republicans are going to have to open their eyes to what Trump has done and continues to do and break away. Those who don't will be voted out of office in 2020 https://t.co/up42o16znl

Trump supporters love to attack Comey and Mueller because they blame those two for this probe. These same people want to see our freedoms go down the toilet just like Russia hardly has any.

@krassenstein We all know that are the supporters of Trump! I guess they want to see this country lose our freedoms in the same way that Russia hardly has any freedoms. These same supporters attack Comey and Mueller. We don't because we know these two are honest and know what is best for USA!
This is a beginning! I'd like to see all the Trump Towers turned into affordable housing for low income families. That would be another good thing that the New York Attorney General can do. Barring the Trump family from charity boards would also be necessary besides fines! https://t.co/ahhaxgiHRz
The answer to that question is hell no! If a criminal ever runs for president and wins, he/she should be stripped of that win. The one who technically lost the election should then become president. VP candidates and SCOTUS picks should be considered illegal picks. https://t.co/FhlmugEKpc

@realDonaldTrump Here's the smallest violin playing for you. It is not a which hunt against you. You have enough crimes against you especially those against humanity. Where are your so-called Christian values? I don't think you even have any otherwise you would not have committed these atrosities
So "FOX &amp; Friends" wants Trump's supporters to chip in $80 for the border wall? Why not ask them to chip in $500 or $1,000 for this border wall? He just might get his 5 million dollars to build this stupid border wall. Then these supporters can be repaid by Trump and Mexico! https://t.co/isZh1VetIb

@JayValenz67 To true. The Vietnam Vets deserve better from our government. Instead, those vets get kicked in the gut with this bill being quashed. The GOP will add to our deficit by spending millions for a border wall and yet can't spare paying for those benefits our vets so richly deserve.

@EllenMorris1222 @shashatheitch22 @LaurenBaratzL @HillaryClinton @GOP I do so agree with you. Hillary Clinton is the rightful president. It is time she is given the office that was stolen from her. The GOP (Greed Over People) would be ripping their hair our of their heads if the elction was stolen from them. We'd be at SCOTUS to determine who won.
@thomaskaine5 You are not the only one who is worried about how we get trump out of office without him blowing up the world. He throws temper tantrums like a 2 year old because he can't get his way.
and the ACA also provided a mandate to all health insurance carriers that they could NOT DENY coverage to anyone with a preexisting condition. The Republicans and Trump's supporters never understood that and neither did they give a damn. https://t.co/dKTBz6rbuy

How #sociopathinchief can have a 81% approval rating in Iowa is beyond me. Republicans must own a ton of pig farms in Iowa.

Saudi Arabia says the US Senate "interfered" over the Jamal Khashoggi murder. I don't think so. They were not supporting the Crown Prince because of his involvement in this murder. Trump is so blind to what kind of a person the Crown Prince really is and the Senate knows this. https://t.co/y7mb76Bv5J
@krassenstein The resisters "snowflakes"? I don't think so! I would call Trump's supporters snowflakes since they are so blind to the facts of what kind of person he truly is. SNL does a good job with this daily soap opera. I can't wait to see what SNL comes with if the House impeaches Trump
Good timing! Best Christmas gift for the resisters! Seeing him panic big time. #ImpeachTrump #ImpeachTrumpNow #Impeach45	 #HaveYourselfAVeryMuellerChristmas https://t.co/mLMl8JbZwC
Seeing Nancy Pelosi as President would make my day any day of the week! If we got rid Trump, Pence and the entire cabinet members, millions of Americans will be singing &amp; dancing in the streets. Party Time! https://t.co/1pAXJAE7yh
It has always been about money. Trump and his crime family has always cared about money and how they can get it. No wonder Jared Kushner is at home with this crime family. It is a tight knit crime family that just cares about money and to hell with anybody else. https://t.co/9891MCeqvF
If I thought the 2000 election was a 3 ring circus, the 2016 election was a stolen election. Gore won the popular vote in 2000 and Hillary did as well in 2016. It is time to elect our presidents via the popular vote. Trump, you are heading for prison along with your crime family! https://t.co/h4AmxzuPnX
Ain't that the truth. Mueller and the New York AG are preparing him for prison in solitary confinement. I can just see Trump going out of his mind being in solitary confinement. He'd be away for all that luxury that he grew up with. Small violin playing "poor baby" for him https://t.co/oYBtiskjpJ
I can just see what our founding fathers, let alone Eisenhower &amp; Lincoln, would say about this administration: "CORRUPT" and they will be shaking their heads with disgust at this administration let alone the current GOP. Trump and current GOP are spineless snakes with  venom https://t.co/eDEw9xccFw
This is what he is totally afraid of: JAIL TIME for Trump! He is shaking in his shoes with fear about what could happen to him if the House draws up Articles of Impeachment. https://t.co/Zuy1CoRU5h
@krassenstein The GOP is finally finding out how toxic cadet bonespurs is to candidates in state legislatures, governors, and national elections. The GOP rats are finally jumping ship and he is in a panic. It's "how can they leave me after all that I have done for this country?" GOP: "EASY"
RT @krassenstein: The fact that this has not happened earlier says quite a bit about the GP:		https://t.co/N7ONk25Wtw
Tariffs NEVER work! They cost jobs which is something the United States cannot afford. We need our jobs here in the United States. Why the GOP (Greed Over People) does not understand that is anyone's guess. They will never get it. GOP brains are always mush! https://t.co/taOxv1Smgj
Amen to what Rep Swalwell said. I can't wait to see the end of this Mobster Presidency. With a new Congress coming in a few weeks, these days of mob rule will be coming to a close under @realDonaldTrump. We will be able to take back our country. https://t.co/LZn5noW6tF
The smallest violin is playing "poor baby" to Trump for saying "over my dead body" on doing an interview with Mueller. Glad that prosecutors are probing Trump's business back to 1982 plus when he hired Manafort &amp; Stone to lobby for him. Giuliani ain't doing Trump any good. https://t.co/9q1NIpdFwC
the look on his face says "why me?" Well, Trump may know that Mueller is pushing Trump into the corner wall and Trump can't breathe. I can't wait to see what will happen in the new Congress and how Trump will deal with the findings they come up with. Let's hope for impeachment! https://t.co/XKOQGbETtT
@krassenstein @bois1234 @realDonaldTrump I can see the #sociopathinchief screaming when he reads this. Especially when he sees where Obama is ranked and where he is ranked. #sociopathinchief thinks he has done this country a world of good; NOT!!! Obama was one of the BEST presidents this country EVER had.
@jupitergirl @AllardyceMaggie @Bornabrit1 I just looked up the penalty for treason. I would like to see Congress punish the #sociopathinchief for treason. I would not care if he received the death penalty (there is always a first time). Most likely, he would get prison and fine &amp; would not be able to hold any office.
@PassionFruit62 @realDonaldTrump @VP @WhiteHouse @PressSec @MickMulvaneyOMB Thank you for this perfect tweet. You are correct in your own tweet to #Individual1 . Prison time is in his future. No one is above the law; The president is NOT above the law. If he thinks he is, he has lost his marbles.
The best tweet I have seen this afternoon! Best one to read that will bring a chuckle out you. https://t.co/SyJpxMZV6t
thank you, Sen. Durbin! At this point in time, the Republican party se ems to be destroying itself. The midterms put Democrats into the House because of healthcare. Voters will remember this ruling. It will cost Republicans in 2020! https://t.co/gSViIsLxxW
Ain't this the truth. @realDonaldTrump is a lifelong criminal and needs to go to PRISON! None of his tweets and Giuliani's pack of lies is going to stop the digging for the truth. Of course, Trump will face the ultimate test: facing God to account for his life. Heaven or hell? https://t.co/leSbW2Lb0E
@PAULUSV3 @B52Malmet Yes. Though I was a little girl when that happened. I do know something about the Vietnam War. The last line in my tweet had something to do with just our country and her citizens. Right now, people can't do the one basic thing: respect each other.
Now this is sad. We have gun violence erupting all over the place and the one person who writes something about it winds up dead. What is this nation coming to? Do we love our guns more than we do our children? Seems like we love our guns more than our children. Let's change that https://t.co/l7p6gCfW1S
Holy Shit! That is a TON of $! Once we get Trump and his crime family behind bars for good, we will be able to save more money for taxpayers. We can take his properties and turn it into low income housing complete with services at AFFORDABLE prices. https://t.co/yZ3MQJ2oq2
@jupitergirl I wonder how I would survive in his class. I survived my own professors class but barely. Which president and supreme court justices did he teach? Glad Adam Schiff had him as a professor.
@jupitergirl That is true. I was just thinking about once he is removed from office when Pence can pardon him. That was my thinking. Thank you for bringing up what  the constitutional scholars would say.
I saw a tweet from Mark Hamill that he found from Trump. Trump asked Obama "can you impeach a sitting president for gross incompetence?" back in 2014. I guess we will find out soon with this particular #sociopathinchief.
It is time for those Child Migrant Camps to close for good! Those camps were concentration camps and this Administration could careless what the hell happens to any of these children. We all saw what happened to that 7 year old girl who was denied water,by Border Patrol, and died https://t.co/pxnUUqwhho
I am excited to know that the Democrats will be in control of the House in 19 Days! making my Christmas shine brighter. Everyone: #HaveYourselfAVeryMuellerChristmas! https://t.co/O4vL4D8yK7
I remember when America stood for something. That was around the 1960s-1980s. Americans knew how to respect, show compassion, human decency. People understood the very idea of democracy and basic human rights. It is not the case right now. That is so sad to see. We are better! https://t.co/AS7IU2YVpx
@B52Malmet I think that was somewhere between the 1960s-1970s. Maybe into the 1980s. At that time, the very idea of democracy and human rights stood for something. Americans knew how to respect people, showed compassion, stood for basic human rights among others. Now, this is not the case.
@Bornabrit1 AMEN! We need to change that DOJ rule on indicting a sitting president. OUR Congress has to HAVE A SET OF BALLS to get the job done in getting rid of this #sociopathinchief. He is too much of a criminal to let slip through the cracks unpunished.
So far, the best tweet I have seen tonight. We all know that Trump is a "fucking moron" among other things. A big time sociopath and psychopath. all around jerk. https://t.co/m4mudDiJJ7
@krassenstein We ought to send this to @realDonaldTrump and see what he has to say about it. I wonder how thick his skin is to see how many people say these things. Will Melania faint when she sees all of these comments? Just might.
@SenSchumer Thank you, Sen Schumer. As a person with epilepsy, I am thankful for the ACA. It means that I don't have to fight for healthcare coverage. Now that the GOP has screwed it up, I have go back to fighting. When will these people understand anything? GOP stands for Greed Over People
NOT MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE. The only difference is one is a farm animal. Both are jackasses. The so-called "human" is a MAJOR JACKASS and one who should be put into isolation when he goes to prison. https://t.co/vXM36nuKcq
Please don't use "Mickey Mouse"; he's MUCH smarter than the #sociopathinchief! Come with a name for a rat and that would be perfect for the next Chief of Staff. After all, the entire administration are RATS! https://t.co/NvAGs4lQ7u
@brycetache @nancy_kerschner From this resister: You're Welcome, You're Welcome, You're Welcome! It will be interesting to see what the next weeks will hold for the #sociopathinchief with the new Congress especially with Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the House once again!
@LunaGir50479505 @d1Vinman That is so very true. Who on earth could forget what kinds of men these two are. Sessions started this whole travesty with the "Zero Tolerance" shit and Miller kept it going. Makes me sick.
@Thms80 @Bornabrit1 @MJD1953 AMEN! Time to elect our presidents via popular vote.
If tRump is pardoned by Pence, it just might put a Democrat into the White House like it did in 1976 after President Ford pardoned Nixon for his crimes with Watergate. This ain't Watergate. It's "RUSSIAGATE"!!!!!! https://t.co/x5dRPdr5cG
@jupitergirl @Bornabrit1 If he is pardoned by Pence, a democrat just might win back the White House like we did in 1976 after President Ford pardoned Nixon for his crimes with Watergate. This ain't Watergate; it's "RUSSIAGATE"!!!!!!!!
What does this say about our #sociopathinchief? we already know he has completely lost ALL OF HIS marbles. The brain has turned into mush. https://t.co/zDLyuWAKtR
@realDonaldTrump dosen't give a DAMN if a young girl dies in the hands of Border Patrol. He and his cronies have no respect for human life. He has committed so many crimes against humanity it is not funny. It breaks my heart to hear something like this tragedy. Damn him to hell. https://t.co/d28wkDWDiO
AMEN to facts mattering! Trump and Republicans think that the Top 1% and those without preexisting conditions deserve healthcare. The rest of us, NAH! Those with preexisting conditions or who are poor will be denied AGAIN! Damn the GOP and Trump to HELL! SOLD OUT TO THE DEVIL https://t.co/KZYgwS70el
THE ENTIRE Trump Administration, POTUS and VP, plus Putin need to be TRIED in the INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT AT THE HAGUE in the Netherlands! POTUS and Putin for violation of International Law; POTUS and Administration for crimes against humanity! https://t.co/BtyeOultc6
I agree! We need to get this corrupt administration out of the White House and DESTROY this current corrupt GOP (Greed Over People). This current corrupt GOP only believes in PARTY OVER COUNTRY. Every congressional Republican and Trump Administration needs to be ACCOUNTABLE! https://t.co/fBpA7dmapV
She's the legitimate president! My first thought! She doesn't cheat to win the presidency. What is your first thought of Hillary Clinton? Would she have made a good president? https://t.co/nj09fSS61c
Glad to know that Ryan Zinke is leaving the White House. The nut-case was the worst Secretary of the Interior that America ever had. Good Riddance! #Resist #Impeach45 https://t.co/lzgf9tQTvL
So true. People with a neurological disorder could get health insurance right off the bat with Obamacare. Now the Republicans just want those with preexisting conditions to be denied that healthcare coverage just so we can die at a faster rate. To them, healthcare is a privledge https://t.co/5OCuvX6zSj
@TheDonald4Life @SilviaElenaFF @JoaquinCastrotx When a child, in the CUSTODY OF BORDER PATROL, dies the United States becomes the MONSTERS to these people. Only uncaring, selfish, self-centered, self-righteous people would  call these people filth. They do not practice what they preach or the teachings of Jesus Christ.
@TheDonald4Life @SilviaElenaFF @JoaquinCastrotx If they are fleeing domestic violence and violence in their countries, that is called "asylum" seekers. If we don't show humanity, we are the monsters. When we don't provide any assistance to a sick child like the one in custody of Border Patrol who died in THEIR CUSTODY.
@TurtleTears send me your recipe please? I prefer unsweetened.
We probably should keep Maria Butina here in the U.S. for her "protection" from Russia. Sending her back to Russia would sure put her life in danger faster than keeping her here. Who knows what Putin would try to do to her if she goes back to Russia. Would he try something here? https://t.co/oSR7vJcFOL
SINCE the Putrid Pumpkin likes Putin so much, he will flee to Russia to escape the onslaught of the legal prosecutors. He doesn't want to accept his crimes and face the consequences of those crimes. He's such a jackass though I could come up with a stronger word. https://t.co/8NDqEO8yiV
So true. The Putrid Pumpkin has kept this country so divided that we are finding out how many selfish, self-righteous &amp; vicious mean people who live here. These same people go around acting like they are one of us. America deserves so much better. She deserves RESPECT &amp; HUMANITY https://t.co/8uGLS7wkP6
I can't wait to see what the new AG in New York is going to do to tRump and his crime family. This soap opera gets better and better by the day. I have to go to the store to get more popcorn and stuff to make iced tea so I can continue to watch this soap opera keep unfolding https://t.co/adu08kJ5QO
Flynn is a disgrace to the uniform he wears from the branch of military service he served. My grandfather, who was a Naval Captain, would be embarrassed with Flynn's actions. Flynn deserves to be locked up for life in federal prison for lying to the FBI. I am sick of all this BS. https://t.co/7NBSA9jJXo
This means HE cannot be our president! As he is not an American BORN citizen or naturalized citizen, he cannot hold the office of the presidency! And he screamed about President Obama's place of birth? Oh this news makes my day really happy! Can't wait for the GOP to rant! https://t.co/hdPnIPjOaS
As it should be: if an athlete cheats to win an Olympic event, their Gold Medal is removed and awarded to the next Olympic Athlete. In this case, tRump and team should be removed and Hillary should be AWARDED the presidency and Tim Kaine the Vice Presidency. Legitimate winners! https://t.co/GUUJGQxpLr
@SilviaElenaFF @JoaquinCastrotx I think anyone who is connected to the tRump administration is just as guilty as Border Patrol. They cover-up something this tragic. So much for humanity. The United States has become uncaring "monsters" to these people who are only seeking asylum in our country. Same on tRump.
This sure doesn't surprise me. It seems that anyone, who is CONNECTED with the tRump administration, will cover up anything that happens to an illegal immigrant and they brush it off like it was nothing. Where is the humanity in the United States? Have we become monsters? https://t.co/DfiGjfIoic
I am not surprised that Manafort, Cohen, and anyone else on tRump's campaign team pulled off crimes so he could become POTUS. I am not surprised tRump continues to commit crimes while he is in the Oval Office. LOCK THEM ALL UP AND THROW AWAY THE KEY! THEY ALL CAN ROT IN HELL!!!!! https://t.co/73MRXhkD4C
Why am I not surprised that Lying Ryan killed a bipartisan bill to end US support of Saudi Arabia. I can see @TeamPelosi passing that bipartisan bill when she becomes Speaker of the House next year! Go for it Nancy Pelosi! We need to end support of Saudi Arabia. https://t.co/up8NKzphC0
a violation of the Emoluments Clause that is in the U.S. Constitution! Another: sheer stupidity! https://t.co/2yIeWOOsV8
@tonyschwartz I can tell what the Republican Party is for: Greed Over People! That is what the GOP stand for. It is not the Lincoln party where there was the fiscal responsibility, ethical and lawful behavior, civility, protecting the environment, the middle class &amp; poor people of any race
I am going to be singing and dancing for joy to see Ivanka Trump going down for tax crimes in the Inauguration Scam. The Trump Crime Family will be going down in flames. They may not like it, but who gives a damn. They deserve whatever sentence they get. LOCK ALL OF THEM UP!!!!!! https://t.co/JmswBJTONK
tRump supporters will revolt and will be doing civil disobedience if tRump is indicted AND / OR impeached, convicted and removed from office. They WILL blame this on Democrats for this. They won't accept that tRump lied to them all this time. They see tRump as their God. https://t.co/f2CHSkuIDO
I am surprised that Secretary Nielsen even said anything of the death of the 7 year old girl in the custody of U.S. Border Patrol last week. Next question: does she care? NOT! Border Patrol sure doesn't give a damn about anybody but themselves. https://t.co/9DPfFNhf2u
@ugaswimmerbr1 You are correct in saying what you said. We should be a kind human. Problem is that many people don't believe in being a kind human anymore. How many of those so-called Christians actually practice what they preach? Not many.
This is the best news to come out of the Senate to date! Pulling America out of Yemen; condemning the Saudi Crown Prince for the Khashoggi murder; and stopped turning a blind eye to the 85,000 children who have died has made me glad. Let's hope the House does the same https://t.co/lLZwGJCZO2
Now that would be a great ticket in 2020! Go for it Biden! I would rather see you as president and @RepBetoORourke as Vice President any day! https://t.co/OwgxKlWpaR
Great picture of the ending of the GOP (Greed Over People)! Perfect way to end the day. My grandparents would have liked this cartoon as they were Eisenhower Republicans; they would have disliked and not voted for Trump at all. https://t.co/F99lqEjfhr
Another small violin playing for Ivanka. No one in the Trump Crime Family, especially Daddy, can help her with her woes. Everyone in that crime family will go down with her. https://t.co/2CL4hSzqrZ

Damn, Omarosa would be a good Chief-of-Staff! She could kick #Individual1 in the ass to keep him in line. Maybe, just maybe, we might see some kind of truth (if any) coming out. She might be able to force a few people out the door just like Kelly did to her. https://t.co/cwVA6s2LnP
#Individual1 and Kerstjen Nielsen should be charged with this tragedy! We are supposed to be a humanitarian country. Under tRump, we are not. His fucking wall is MORE important than being a humanitarian. Both can rot in hell with the devil. They are the devil's advocate! https://t.co/tRyqSQFflU
Will never understand why these tRump cultists call themselves "pro-life" when they are "pro-death" for the majority of Americans who do not like tRump. Those who hate tRump, are not worth saving from death according to these people. These so called "pro-lifers" are monsters! https://t.co/gbcqqimE8l
@mcspocky Pro-life to these tRump cultists means it is life for them only and to HELL with the rest of us. Those who don't like tRump can all die for all these cultists care. You are correct to say that they are monsters. They say they believe in God; I say that they believe in the devil.
Holy Shit! Scott Walker just made Wisconsin more into a "dictatorship" with his signing the lame duck GOP legislative coup. He and the GOP of Wisconsin just want to stay in power. He is acting like Trump is. I hope his successor can do something to reverse it. https://t.co/cbEem0grzu
@StopLordDampnut It is true. I am a paralegal. Whether you believe me or not is your affair. I quite frankly don't believe a word you say to me. I know what judges have to do. Do you know anything about the law? I doubt it. Do you believe that preexisting conditions should be covered? doubt it
@StopLordDampnut Sure it is not his job to care about the consequences or benefits of a law or action. I do know something about the rule of law as I have taken law classes. I do know that everyone has the right to be covered with health insurance regardless of a preexisting condition.
The smallest violin is playing for Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly! Why complain about being "emotionally" hurt by "accusations" when it is quite possible that those accusations are TRUE! These two shouldn't complain since they brought it upon themselves in the first place! https://t.co/WWosV7hUJr
This is the best news I could read before I go off to bed! Another Republican under investigation for Campaign Finance Crimes! Wonder how many more GOP senators and/or representatives will be investigated for campaign finance crimes? should be interesting! GOP maybe destroyed! https://t.co/UgRWF0GXGZ
That Texas judge should be impeached and thrown off the bench! He doesn't care about people who need those protections and that Affordable Care Act. No Republican in this administration or Congress will lift a finger to help average Americans who NEED those protections! Damn them https://t.co/Pq0w297qTv
@robreiner This should tell Trump that when he is impeached, and hopefully convicted, millions will be singing &amp; dancing in the streets! Party time for days, weeks and months! We will regain some sanity in our nation with Trump gone from the White House. Should be a lesson to Trump!
And when that happens, millions will be singing &amp; dancing in the streets! It will be a major party that will last days, weeks and maybe months! We will rejoice in his impeachment and hopefully conviction! Never conspire with a foreign enemy power to fraudulently steal an election https://t.co/MKNh18a04e
@blakcoffee @StevenTDennis @sahilkapur @senatemajldr Good one! @senatemajldr does have a that preexisting condition in being Lucifer's son! #Individual1 is Lucifer! However, #Individual1 is Putin's Crown Prince! So I guess you can say, all three of them are working for the devil! May all three of them rot in hell. They deserve it.
@SenFeinstein Will we ever address the epidemic of gun violence? How many more mass shootings and deaths does the United States have go through before people realize there is an epidemic of gun violence? I hope that both Houses will be able to do something to help with this gun violence.
I knew I was correct: that damn tax "reform" bill went to benefit ONLY the TOP 1% and to hell with the rest of us. Ivanka and Jared Kushner should have to pay a good chunk of $ IN taxes just like POTUS AND FLOTUS! Top 1% should do the same! https://t.co/hynp8tzU6r
Regardless of emotions, the facts don't look good for Trump. The Republicans will always be in massive denial. Democrats will be anxious. As a Democrat myself, I am glad that the facts don't look good for Trump. I can see Trump shaking with fear in his shoes! https://t.co/3ZdozbhnMI
@ProudResister @realDonaldTrump Regardless of the emotions, the facts do show that they don't look good for Trump right now. Republicans will always be in massive denial and Democrats will be overly anxious. Even with my emotions as a Democrat, I can see that the facts don't look good for Trump. That feels good
And Republicans ALWAYS said they wanted deficit responsibility so it doesn't fall on our children and grandchildren? They want fiscal responsibility in the president's yearly budget? Republicans speak with FORKED tongues! I am sick of all their bullshit especially #Individual1. https://t.co/K8RlAehZbb
It is about time that we have a sexual harassment bill, that is BIPARTISAN, that will be signed into law! About time sexual harassment cases will be handled to protect victims instead of protecting politicians. I am HAPPY to hear this news! Thank you, Sen. @amyklobuchar . https://t.co/T5ZYSneD27
I wonder how Putin and Trump feel about this bit of news. Think Trump is shaking in his shoes with fear in what Maria Butina has said or will be telling Mueller? I highly think so. https://t.co/kxx99vczsr

@AviAhvee I don't think Melania even knows or understands what the emoluments clause is in the United States Constitution. We know that her kleptocratic husband doesn't understand that clause. Down with the Trump Crime Family!
Biden and Harris? That would be an interesting ticket. If Pence somehow wiggle's his way out of the Russia probe and it only affects Trump, a Biden/Harris ticket could send Pence back to his home in Indiana. https://t.co/vUXlJblbwD

@SenSchumer Thank you, Sen. Schumer. I have faith in you and that Democratic leadership. Have a good holiday season.
I loathe the Trump Crime Family! The #psychopathinchief thinks he "knows" everything when he doesn't. FLOTUS is just as bad if not worse. The entire family is so loathsome that it is sickening. How people thought he would make a good POTUS is beyond me. LOCK HIM UP! https://t.co/stfV6YFyrT

Melania Trump is as bad as #psychopathinchief when it comes to calling the media "liars". She better get used to the media attacking her and her #psychopathinchief husband. I can't wait to see her screaming the minute she and the entire Trump crime family is put into prison! https://t.co/5YeASGHoTg
Glad that every senator in both parties joined to condemn the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and hold Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman responsible. It is time for our #psychopathinchief to realize it and stop ignoring that murder. https://t.co/LZGecWqy8r

@krassenstein I actually could care less what FLOTUS' approval rating is.  Between her and the rest of the Trump family, their ratings can all go down the toilet and I am sure that millions of Americans will be happy. At least those who know the truth of the stupidity of the GOP and Trump
Amen to that, Rob Reiner! Love the warning to the GOP! Either we impeach and convict or history will show that the GOP enabled, aided and abetted a criminal as president. We need to impeach and convict #Individual1 https://t.co/o7vUJvPIGS

This is the best cartoon I have seen today. Surrounding himself with "Pinocchio Posse" is a good idea for Trump. After all, he's the biggest liar. The more liar's he has on staff, the better! Not so good for the country. Great for the #Individual1 https://t.co/8bu2520gWo
Democrats need to take back the Senate in 2020 since there will be people who are up for reelection. We need to help Sen. Doug Jones keep his seat in 2020. Alabama needs him to remain in the Senate! https://t.co/Brbwc9sXa6
AMEN! No one is above the law. That especially goes for the #sociopathinchief. Even the Vice President is not above the law. Pence also thinks he's above the law just because he's #sociopathinchief's vice president. Justice will prevail when these two spend time in jail! https://t.co/XIl9YZLG6R
@robreiner I liked this tweet. You said it well with your quote from former Sec. State Tillerson. Wonder if he will be served with a subpoena by Mueller to testify against Trump? Only time will tell.
Rob Reiner said it best when he quoted Former Dec. State Tillerson on Trump: "He's a fucking moron". Trump will always be that "fucking moron".  Why this fucking moron's supporters can't see that is way beyond me. Time to #Impeach45 NOW https://t.co/hkPoA1qYFY
Are the Congressional Republicans finally waking up and seeing Trump for who he is? If that is happening, it is ABOUT TIME! What is that saying, "better late than never"?

The look on Schumer's face is one of "Shut up, Trump. You disgust me". Not to mention it is a look of "are you using what happened in France as part of your threat to shut down the government?" Wonder what the other excuses Trump can up with for the Democratic leaders. https://t.co/u42O9Mezpy
I remember the Cold War. The US was a leader for freedom and democracy. Now it is the opposite. We make our enemies into allies, deny climate change &amp; deny that someone in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia had something to do with the murder of a journalist. This is a tragedy today. https://t.co/UqASxG78Vg
There would singing, dancing and partying in the streets. Wonder how many police officers would join us? Now that is how you revolt when there is an impeachment and conviction of a lamebrain president. Partying for DAYS, WEEKS, AND MONTHS! https://t.co/GazLZGj36l
@lisastark351 We'd be singing, dancing and partying in the streets! Wonder how many police officers will be joining in those parties? That is how one "revolts" when one badass president is impeached and convicted! ONE BIG PARTY FOR DAYS, WEEKS AND MONTHS!
I can just see @LindseyGrahamSC crying out "Not True", "Not True" with this article. This should be handed to the Special Council so he can investigate the GOP for their involvement with Russia. I wonder how many would be impeached and convicted? Dare we begin with McConnell? https://t.co/ObAhEKUkQp
So True! 	#ImWithNancy	#BadAssPelosi 	#TeamPelosi 	This woman is smarter than #Individual1 and can keep her cool. #BadAssPelosi can stand her ground with Trump and he knows it. The guy is afraid of her but doesn't want his supporters to know. https://t.co/CoSc6KEM3Z
My guesses:	- Am I going to be charged in this investigation?	- Can I go home and take a nap?	- I can't take all this bickering from Trump, Pelosi and Schumer	- I am getting a massive migraine. 	- God, help me get through this debate with Trump, Pelosi and Schumer	- I am out! https://t.co/meAJqumIiw
@MrsRabbitResist My guesses:	- Will I be charged in this Mueller investigation?	- Someone get me out of here	- Do I have hear Trump, Pelosi and Schumer arguing again?	- I am getting a massive migraine with all this bickering	- can't wait to get back home	- There a way I can take a nap?
#Individual1 must not realize that there are people who would be dancing, partying in the streets and not going to work for weeks if he is #impeached. If #Individual1 is convicted there will be even more dancing and partying in the streets. People will not go to work for weeks https://t.co/KQCC7IL2yI
Best tweet to wake up to. The NRA is the problem to America not having stronger gun reform laws. I am tired of hearing about mass shootings at schools, concerts, religious institutions, etc. The NRA needs to be dismantled and NOW! https://t.co/E4WFkckzX3
Trump's ignorant supporters need a brain transplant. Trump was not the victor in yesterday's debate with Pelosi and Schumer.  Pelosi and Schumer were the victors in that debate. Trump acted like a 2 year old throwing a temper tantrum because he can't get his way. The man is EVIL https://t.co/cghwKDPpOJ
If Senior GOP officials are considering dumping Trump to save the party, they had better do it NOW! Waiting until the 2020 Presidential election will not save the party. They have to DUMP TRUMP NOW if they want to save their party. Otherwise, it will be too little, too late. https://t.co/Qpygw9lcQm
@RepBetoORourke would get my vote should get run for President and win. Let's hope and pray that he will throw his hat into the ring for being the Democratic nominee in 2020. I'd love to see Ted Cruz's jaw hit the floor in total shock that his opponent won the presidency in 2020 https://t.co/9VJnp4Wm34
If this current GOP actually abandons Trump I think I will faint. My jaw will be hanging to floor in total surprise if the current GOP actually abandons Trump. Would that include impeachment and possible conviction? I hope so. Have their eyes be finally opened? I hope so. https://t.co/1MlqQRPEvG
Sarah Huchabee Sanders will always be remembered as a LIAR and working for the MOST corrupt administration the United States ever had. Sanders does NOT know what the words "Honest" and "Transparent" even mean. https://t.co/qyCLnuIdrm
@ProudResister @SarahHuckabee Ain't that the truth. Sarah Huckabee Sanders will always be remembered as being a LIAR and working for the most corrupt administration the United States has ever had. How she can even say the words "honest and transparent" is beyond me. She DOESN'T EVEN KNOW what those words MEAN
@VP44 May you and Dr. Biden have a wonderful holiday season this year. Thank you for your service as VP under Obama. Both of you made a great team. Merry Christmas and have a Happy New Year.
What Wisconsin, Scott Walker and the GOP (Greed Over People) are trying to do is destroy our democracy and take away our rights. We do not live in a dictatorship. This does not happen in America. #Resist https://t.co/dtgsNzCDEp
I don't think Trump knows how to deal with people standing up to him to his face especially in public. Three women and a Canadian telling Trump off to his face and in public is a job well done in my book! Keep it up guys! #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/S6hQloVDAr
Maybe I need to buy some of Dick's Sporting Goods' Stock. If its gone up since February when they decided to change their gun selling policies, I should have bought some back then. When will the NRA ever learn? Of, that is correct, the NRA has NO BRAINS JUST MUSH for brains https://t.co/VfWU11IabS
If we can #Impeach both Pence and #Individual1 &amp; get rid of the current administration, I will support President Pelosi!

#sociopathinchief throws a tantrum and Democratic leadership act like grown adults. Who is the 2 year old in the Oval Office? Oh yes, it's the #sociopathinchief!

Most of us have known that tariffs don't work. When the Trade Deficit hits a all time high in 10 years, you should know that tariffs don't work. They never will. They didn't work for Reagan when he was in office. Why do people think these tariffs will work now? They won't. https://t.co/FdNaZ23cVH

Scott Walker and the GOP just want to keep power. THIS IS called Dictatorship in one of our 50 states. The GOP (Greed Over People) don't care about anything EXCEPT power no mater how they hang onto it even when they lose elections. that is called destroying democracy https://t.co/5rfIJyvNYl

Maybe "will I be the next one on Mueller's list to testify?" It could also be "am I going to be charged as well?" I wouldn't be surprised if that is what he is thinking especially the one of "am I going to charged as well?". We can only hope that he is also impeached and convict https://t.co/UvnTZdXxGt
It would be strange to see a Biden/Romney ticket for 2020. How do others feel about a unity ticket with these two on it in 2020? Could it be possible that these two might bring unity to our nation? To be continued in 2020. https://t.co/wOAQgaqHnV
The best decision that the jury gave! Justice for all who were injured and especially for Heather Heyer's family. May this person rot in prison for the remainder of his life. https://t.co/blW48kJKIL
I wonder which option the #sociopathinchief will take just so he doesn't shut down the government. the #sociopathinchief has lost his marbles anyway. He constantly throws a tantrum over the wall by threatening to shut down the government. #ImpeachIndividual1 #Resist https://t.co/vdlYspE0Mp
I love how @realDonaldTrump tells Sen @SenSchumer that he would be happy to shut down the government because the country doesn't want criminals pouring into this country. Wow; he ought to look at himself -- he's such a criminal https://t.co/Wxxspcao7j
I totally agree! America needs to know the full truth about the depths of depravity we are dealing with because of this psychopath. Both Trump Crime Family and Kushner Family need to be jailed. Jared especially needs to be jailed; he's lined his pockets with Saudi money. https://t.co/YHP8aBnrvW
I think the FBI should investigate the Georgia election for governor as there had to be GOP election fraud. If the GOP governor-elect has committed crimes to get his post, the FBI needs to be investigating that election. Stacy Abrams should have won that election. https://t.co/BbprN4RtJq
The two words I would use to describe Donald Trump would be "psychopath" and "sociopath". There may be a few more I can come up with, but those two are the first ones I can come up with now. He ain't stable or a genius. If anything he has lost his marbles. https://t.co/yiCofgn5Kn
@AliAdair22 Maybe.
Good One! This was the best thing I have heard all day! https://t.co/6nAGBKsjug
Amazing! I wondered if Maria Butina would strike up a deal and agree to cooperate with US prosecutors in the Russia investigation. My prayers have been answered that she is cooperating with US prosecutors in the Russia investigation. Will Putin have her assassinated or not? https://t.co/Z0I9Kb2K5H
Of course, his supporters would say that these numbers are all wrong. I believe these numbers because we have heard how many trips he has taken to his other "white house" at MaraLargo in Florida. We should not be paying for all these trips. No more trips for Trump. https://t.co/fcFWj6PI77
AND I thought our border guards did that to people who were illegal entering into the USA. Ripping a child from a mother's arms, because she is sitting on the floor since there are NO chairs, is UNACCEPTABLE. We are becoming a hateful society especially toward minorities. https://t.co/9NiBE3auMg
Our congressional leaders, both majority and minority, have no idea what the First Amendment says about the Freedom of speech and protest. By trying to insert a bill to criminalize boycotts of foreign countries is UNCONSTITUTIONAL. We shall fight it ALL THE WAY TO SCOTUS! https://t.co/F4iPMkQL62
@realDonaldTrump new approval ratings slipping to 29% because of the handling of the Russia investigation makes me thrilled. Keep tweeting like this Trump and your numbers will keep going down!  Trump, you are a failure and always will be. https://t.co/ZxY7uVq5CX
I saw the disclosure of Time's Person of the Year on the Today show this morning. I am glad that they chose to do this in honor of those who were either killed or have been targeted for their work as journalists. Good thing that Trump was passed over this year. https://t.co/TbXqI8Wj6q
I agree with @SenBlumenthal about his statements concerning Jared Kusner's MBS cover-up and undermining US intelligence. Jared Kushner has put this country in danger. He NEEDS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE for his actions. Justice must prevail to hold both Trump and Kusher ACCOUNTABLE https://t.co/FdqLanALXS
The money that #Individual1 wants for his border wall can go to fund domestic priorities: infrastructure, health care, paid family &amp; sick leave. There are other domestic priorities like education, social security, medicare &amp; medicaid. https://t.co/kx0PynPpkW
@AliAdair22 Does this remind anyone of what happened to a British citizen who was a former Russian spy? He was poisoned and died with and unknown substance. Question before us now: how do we stop Putin from killing people? The guy is like the Saudi Crown Prince: a murderer!
Question is: who is checking Trump? certainly not the Republicans in Congress. It is only the Democrats and Mueller than are keeping their eye on Trump and his actions. Will anyone ever check what Putin is up to? Probably not. We know that Trump is afraid of Putin. https://t.co/L8GPBnrStM
Does this sound familiar to what happened to the guy who lived in London, England and was a former Russian spy? He was poisoned and died of and unspecified poison? https://t.co/Xr7iAJN9ui
Orrin Hatch will blame Democrats for just about anything when it comes to Trump. He won't accept the wrong that Trump has done beginning with Trump's campaign fraud. Orrin Hatch is as corrupt as Trump is. Both have lost their marbles. Both are corrupt as hell. Both belong in jail https://t.co/Xd016u3bqr
@WatcherSoco @TheUSASingers Good one! Would that be for the administration or for #Individual1 or both? I can see #ImpeachTrump  for #Individual1 and then "terminated" for the administration. What do you think?
@InspiringU2 @NBCNews Best #Individual1 poem I have read! Thank you for the laugh! I love it!
@NancyPelosi When the new Congress is sworn in next month, what will the House Democrats plan on doing when it comes to Trump? Will there be a real investigation in the House Intelligence Committee?
@NancyPelosi President George H.W. Bush won my praise especially when he signed the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990. As a person with Epilepsy, I appreciated he leadership to pass the ADA of 1990. He cared about people and he was appreciated by many people.
Sen Cruz makes this native Texan ashamed to be called a native Texan. Cruz needs a brain transplant to have common sense put into him.  Cruz and others who took Saudi money know how to speak with forked tongues. they are liars and corrupt. As bad as #Individual1 https://t.co/kL2vdYVPIf
Another great tweet from @davidhogg111 . The NRA and Russia own our politicians who have a grade of A from the NRA. Why our politicians can see that Russia owns the NRA is beyond me. Then again, Russia owns our politicians in the GOP! https://t.co/GJ698ANU0H
@davidhogg111 I like your latest tweet to the politicians who have an A from the NRA. Russia owns the NRA with their pumping in money into the NRA. I wonder if Russia is pulling the plug on the money since now the NRA is having some financial woes.
The GOP will always be morally bankrupt. Prior to #Individual1, the GOP had a little more morals. Now they are morally bankrupt. Sen. Orrin Hatch and others are complicit with Trump's crimes. I can't wait to see Trump and these GOP Senators go down. Happy Days are here AGAIN! https://t.co/U1V6GAaqSp
Best #Individual1 (Trump) poem I have read so far! Thank you for the laugh. He wanted to "drain the swamp" and he forgot that he IS the swamp. I could not agree more with the "#TRUMPLIESAREHISDEMISE  as those lies will be his undoing. He's going down hard face first and in mud https://t.co/X6RiAxITK6
Loved this! Take the poll and see what you think and you just might be surprised. After all, it is rather funny as well. If it does come true and Trump is not nominated in 2020; oh, can he be indicted, tried, found guilty &amp; sentenced to jail. My dream would come true! https://t.co/NN7B0zlEux

@krassenstein Orrin Hatch is losing his marbles. I think we need to boot him out of Congress for medical reasons. I mean Trump is trying to get Ginsburg off SCOTUS because he thinks she doesn't have all her marbles together. Justice Ginsburg has more brains than Orrin Hatch.
@SenSchumer  Please do not let Trump get his wish with the wall along the Southern border. It is a waste of taxpayer money. Let him throw a temper tantrum if he doesn't get way. Please do not let him waste our taxpayer money to build that wall.
Let's just hope that Orin Hatch is in his last term as Senator. That comment of "I don't care" if Trump broke the law should get him out of his seat. I hope the people of Utah will open their eyes with that comment. https://t.co/jNDBmJAGJf

I am glad that the French government told Trump to not interfere in French politics. Trump takes us out of the Paris climate agreement and then has the gall tweeting about the protests in France? The #PsychopathinChief needs to worry about our country and not another country https://t.co/hnCGitVidN
If this happens, down goes GOP, NRA and TRUMP! I will be dancing on the rooftops with joy!

Can you see some of the GOP shaking https://t.co/qRBEpnFgHv
Guess that this puts a big blow in both @DonaldJTrump  and Mike Pence sails. They wanted to punish women who sought an abortion. They wanted to control women's health decisions. Thank you SCOTUS for siding with women's rights https://t.co/PbUAXD6L7K
@TheUSASingers words fail me to add other than #PsychopathinChief for Trump. I can't come up with one for his ludicrous administration.
Besides describing him as #LiarInChief, he is also #PsychopathinChief. What kind of word we come up with for the administration is anyone's guess. Anyone have an idea? We will have to develop a new language for this soap opera that is happening. https://t.co/X2k4Ic86qe
@WatcherSoco @TheUSASingers Agreed! We do need a whole new language to describe this shit-show much less soap opera. Not only do we have a #LiarInChief  but he is also the #PsyhopathinChief. His administration is another other thing. Somehow we will have to come up with a new word for the administration
Republicans will never call for Trump's removal from office because they don't want to lose the control of power in the Senate. The current GOP only believes in PARTY OVER COUNTRY. It's called "let's protect a liar rather than get rid of him". https://t.co/9jq6tQWCRk
Oh, I do so agree with this tweet. Once Trump is finally gone, my hope is that people will disengage from politics and will start treating people with a little respect. Our media environment made it so easy to spread hate. That hate has to stop. Respect has to begin. https://t.co/QUKuKp9bd4
Will the next U.S. Chief of Staff last? Trump's chief of staff position is a revolving door. How many has he had since 2017? His current one has been the best one. Of course, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner never liked Kelly so they were happy to hear that Kelly is leaving. https://t.co/gAkCNc8Psw
Punctuation is important to me. I am the daughter of an English teacher. It drives me up the wall when I don't see commas or periods. It can be hard to read a tweet that is a run-on sentence. https://t.co/itWrscb7fM
If Trump resigns and Pence pardons him before the 2020 election, Pence will lose the 2020 election. If Trump resigns, he still faces those criminal charges in New York. Pence can try to pardon him on those charges. https://t.co/NrBGKRoG8R
James Comey said the correct thing. We have to defeat Trump in 2020. If he gets to run for reelection, that has to happen. Trump has to be removed NOW. Trump's lies have to be stopped now before he destroys this country. https://t.co/O86zwaC1w5
If Trump's lawyer's approach Mueller with this nutty idea of resigning in exchange for leniency for his chimes, I think Mueller would be astonished. I think Mueller would tell Trump's lawyer's that Trump has to resign and still face criminal charges in federal court. No leniency https://t.co/lgLcdt1L7l
This is something I agree with. Can you just see the NRA and their supporters pulling their hair out of their heads if they had to get a gun license like they do when they have to buy a one when they go fishing. https://t.co/xJjNBGTW9B
@davidhogg111 I think this would probably bring down the mass shooting we hear about in the United States. Or at least I hope it would. You have the right idea. It is your generation that will lead this country. I applaud your actions.
I bet, with those continued private talks with the Saudi Crown Prince, Kushner lined his pockets with more Saudi money. I am sure that Jared thinks the same way as Trump. That the USA still needs to support Saudi Arabia with their war in Yemmen. https://t.co/c2VoaGTgMC
@britin17k @Bellatrixx2020 @realDonaldTrump You are so correct that @realDonaldTrump was never legitimately elected. He stole the election. There is nothing in the US Constitution that says a sitting president cannot be indicted. He needs to be indicted. I want to see him sent to the Hague and put on trial there. Guilty!
So True! @DonaldJTrumpJr is the biggest Coward that he has to flee to Canada before the next "bombshell" falls on top of him and the rest of the Trump family. The hunter now becomes the hunted! https://t.co/ZyS154VPZY
Just when we thought it couldn't get any worse, it does. Now it is in the Vice President's office. This administration is so corrupt it makes one's head spin. You wonder if there will be another shoe or two or three etc to drop. Will this soap opera ever end? https://t.co/KDqJlHwImq
@TeaPainUSA @vet_concerned We all know Trump should not escape prosecution by virtue of holding the office he stole. He will always believe he is above the law. We know otherwise. His ultimate justice will be before God when he has to account for his life and what he did especially those crimes against USA
Trump said that the election would be rigged in favor of Hillary.  Stealing the election through multiple felonies should not spare him from prosecution. Trump will always think he above the law. No one is above the law. His ultimate justice will be before God when he dies. https://t.co/VsPcLDdiZA

I think this quote from Buddha is perfect.

@ErikViker @oklatexahomas @thehill @NRA You ain't kidding. The NRA is a racist death cult. Will we ever see the end of this racist death cult? I hope so. Defending oneself is a good idea so long as it doesn't get you 51 years in prison.
No wonder McConnell wants to protect @realDonaldTrump . McConnell is just as bad! Both are in bed with Putin! One is Putin's Crown Puppet and the other is Putin's puppet; upper case "Puppet" indicates @realDonaldTrump . Lower case "puppet" indicates @senatemajldr . https://t.co/ht1kCELCJm
@PhilipSpratt3 @oklatexahomas @thehill @NRA By the way, I am NOT a dimwit Democrat bigot. You are the bigot, white supremacist and a racist. If you looked a post, you should have seen that I did not write "white" men. I just wrote the word "men". You have a DOUBLE STANDARD for men and women when it comes to guns.
@PhilipSpratt3 @oklatexahomas @thehill @NRA Why don't you look at what happened to a 16 year old minority female who was given 51 years in prison for standing her ground. Where was the NRA then? Nowhere to be seen. This girl gets 51 years for defending herself and you have the gall to say this shit to me? You are racist
@senrobportman Will this also help in working on our crumbling power grid? Was that part of the $10.8 million BUILD grant? Is it only to help reinvigorate downtown #Youngstown &amp; strengthen the local economy only?
What we saw in both 2016 and 2018, Republicans want voter suppression in order to remain in power. GOP cry "voter fraud" when their president won by fraud and by cheating his way to the presidency. No More! We need Voter protection NOT voter suppression! https://t.co/jR6lYImTm6
@BrianLehrer @gwlauren @staceyabrams It's the Republicans who cry "voter fraud" to Democrats and then they want to suppress a voter's right to vote in an election. The president won the 2016 election via fraud. we need voter reform not voter suppression.
And I bet the people at Fox &amp; Friends were sitting there with their jaws hanging to the floor in shock! I bet these people can't believe that Trump will be indicted. I can just see their faces when Trump is indicted! Shock City!!!!! https://t.co/SMNLryFvyu
And the crazy part is this current fraud of a president claims that the 2016 election was rigged "against" him when in fact it wasn't. Who became our illegitimate president? @realDonaldTrump .

This current GOP (Greed Over People) are so worried about the President and their Party losing power. They don't give a damn about America. It's all about Power to this current GOP. Americans don't matter to this GOP. Eisenhower would be appalled with this current GOP. https://t.co/3ownW3UbAZ

TIME TO ELECT PRESIDENTS VIA POPULAR VOTE! HILLARY CLINTON GOT THE POPULAR VOTE AND IS THE LEGITIMATE PRESIDENT! I guess that means once Trump and Pence are impeached and convicted, Pelosi becomes president and can have Hillary become her VP. Resignation and Hillary is President https://t.co/zOPoaxpD2e
I can see that happening! Hillary becoming president and she tears up what Trump did so she can bring back Obama's legacy. Oh, that would make all those Trumpsters so pissed off that they see red. Maybe they might move to Red China or to Russia. https://t.co/L2aDrs55z9
How about making the Trump Towers into condos that come with everything paid for (gas,electric,cable,phone) and having your own cooks, maids? These condos can go to homeless veterans, homeless people and those who live in poverty. https://t.co/MLJXsPjqrN

I highly doubt that Republicans will care that Trump's DOJ is alleging that Trump conspired to commit to 2 felonies. The Republicans will never care what happens because they put blinders on. https://t.co/5TmvTE27Ze
@Missallaineous1 @AngelMarks4 @realDonaldTrump You just made an assumption of me. @realDonaldTrump  is KNOWN as Cadet Bone Spurs. Do you think he took the oath of service and put on a uniform for this country? Hell NO! The guy was a DRAFT DODGER. You are the HYPOCRITE. Do not reply to me EVER AGAIN.
@Missallaineous1 @AngelMarks4 @realDonaldTrump Actually you are the one that is full of shit. Were your family at Pearl Harbor when it was bombed? Mine was! I criticize the president because the guy is an idiot and deserves all the criticism he gets. I did NOT make assumptions ABOUT YOU OR YOUR FAMILY.
@BillHaslam Gov Haslam, you cannot let a young woman face a miscarriage of justice. She stood her ground by defending herself; a 16 year old, who was being sex-trafficked, was given 51 years. Outrageous! You have to get involved and stop this miscarriage of justice. Thank you.
It's time to get the governor and senators, not to mention state legislators, involved in this injustice. We need to help clear this young woman because she stood her ground by defending herself. https://t.co/nnfZRXfVW3
@oklatexahomas @thehill @NRA Hey, the NRA ONLY GIVES a damn about men standing their ground and don't care about a woman defending herself. They believe in a double standard. To them, women are pawns to play with especially if they are minorities!
It's a double standard! Men get one sentence: "Not Guilty" when they stand their ground and women get one sentence: "Guilty". The justice system is SCREWED UP FOR WOMEN! It's fine to sex-traffic a 16 year old girl and she can't defend herself; she gets 51 years? We're screwed https://t.co/L3NlXiAbwB
This is where we need to begin to ELECT our presidents by POPULAR VOTE so as to no have stolen elections from someone like @realDonaldTrump . He's NOW a fraud of a president and a felon. Dare we send him to the Hague or just impeach, convict and throw him into jail? https://t.co/nRnNdTX0Gm
The #GOP leadership are so closed mouthed about the fact that the first United States president has been named a felon! I doubt that they can believe a sitting president has been named a felon. I don't know if the #GOP leadership will ever accept it. https://t.co/ZpPebraUdf
No truer words were said! I always go for the "It's easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle that it is for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven" -Jesus. He knew exactly what to say about a rich man. The TOP 1% will have a difficult time getting to heaven. https://t.co/NphT4CuDMa
Ivanka Trump deserves whatever her father gets. She should not evade Mueller's investigation. She needs to face the consequences that Manafort and Flynn have faced. There are no special laws for Ivanka and the Trump family that hold them "Above the Law" and us "Below the Law" https://t.co/ySjd87DG7x
@realDonaldTrump is nominating someone to succeed Nikki Haley as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who has no experience in government other than being a "spokeswoman" for the State Department. His mentality is sinking fast. https://t.co/ayV9FHnEEN
If both are indicted, I hope the ENTIRE administration is toast as well. Then it will be President Pelosi! Oh, wouldn't that be fun! I can just see her UNDO EVERYTHING @realDonaldTrump did to Obama's legacy. https://t.co/AmbzLFjL4p
To answer that question: HELL YES! @realDonaldTrump has lied and has committed crimes against humainity plus has cozy relationships with ENEMIES OF THE USA! https://t.co/dw0bjji7OQ
Let's add this to Mueller's list of corruption in @realDonaldTrump 's Administration. @realDonaldTrump constantly complained about @HillaryClinton email problems while she was Secretary of State and yet he has people in his administration that has the SAME PROBLEMS! JAIL TIME!!!! https://t.co/wDAVH8fgvY
@aroseblush That is why the DOJ is suppose to be a separate institution from the presidency. That way we can look at the evidence and move forward. It is time to talk impeachment and conviction of this POTUS plus jail time for life.
If @realDonaldTrump is impeached, convicted by the Senate &amp; thrown in jail it will be a first for the Nation! What an entry it would make for the history books! I can just see our grandchildren and great-grandchildren wondering how someone could be such a traitor to his country https://t.co/yG5U7JVvFe
No truer statement could be said. Not only did he do all these things, he made our enemies OUR ALLIES! Then he turns our allies into our enemies! Of course, Individual 1 is too stupid to realize we are actualize talking about @realDonaldTrump! Our grandchildren will ask WTF? https://t.co/AuGLk1wTHq
So very true. Trump is mentally failing, has never been faithful, makes terrible decisions and IS a traitor. He will ALWAYS BE a TRAITOR. Hopefully, we can bring down that traitor and lock him up for GOOD. Need to give him the price of treason against the USA! https://t.co/IBqcROa6GF
@robreiner This reminds me of the story of The Boy Who Cried Wolf. Our pathological liar is like that little boy who is crying wolf "3 times" and people are not going to believe him.

#GOP under #Nixon had far more guts and duty to country. At that time, it was country over power to the #GOP. Now it is power OVER country. Under McConnell, the current #GOP is complicit in undermining our democracy. It is also complicit in holding Trump responsible. https://t.co/uz4M4LQj56

@Missallaineous1 @AngelMarks4 @realDonaldTrump birthday. So if anyone is a hypocrite, it is you. I do more in remembering and thanking those who have served our country for our freedoms. I will always be thankful for those who served and gave the ultimate sacrifice for our freedoms. Will you be thankful? I wonder. Trumpite.
@Missallaineous1 @AngelMarks4 @realDonaldTrump father at Christmas because your father was a Naval Captain and had to be at the base surveying the destruction of Pearl Harbor? I don't think you would like it. That is what my father, grandmother and aunt went through. The attack happened several weeks prior to my father's 5th
@Missallaineous1 @AngelMarks4 @realDonaldTrump destruction that was witnessed at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 and see if your children can stop crying after hearing about it? I can only imagine what my father and aunt went through after not seeing their father for 2-3 weeks after the bombing. How would like not to see
@Missallaineous1 @AngelMarks4 @realDonaldTrump I spent time with WWII vets besides tweeting. What gives you the right to criticize me? I remembered them for their service to our country 77 years ago. My grandfather was in the Navy living in Honolulu at the time Pearl Harbor was bombed. You explain to your young children the
@Missallaineous1 @AngelMarks4 @realDonaldTrump I have recognized this day. You apparently have not. you don't have read anything I say about the president. he tweets lies and believe those lies. don't respond
@Missallaineous1 @AngelMarks4 @realDonaldTrump about the destruction that his father saw? It was not easy for my grandfather to tell his children much less my grandmother about the destruction at Pearl Harbor. I honor and remember those men and civilians who lost their lives. What do you do? Do you remember and honor them?
@Missallaineous1 @AngelMarks4 @realDonaldTrump I am remembering and honoring those who sacrificed their lives for their country. I am also honoring my grandfather who had to leave his family for about three weeks to go the base because he commanded submarine tenders. My father was 4. Want to tell me how you tell a 4 year old
Let us remember how the United States disliked fascism and Nazism in the 1940s. Now we have to learn from those who sacrificed so much to defeat fascism and Nazism in the 21st century in our country with Trump as president. https://t.co/Tw2ZQbDNVV
These are the survivors we should remember as well. We just lost one president from the Greatest Generation. He survived WWII and became our 41st president. We honor those handful of survivors who are in their 90s and are part of that Greatest Generation. God Bless these people https://t.co/5H5bC6NleP
Let us never forget those service members and civilians who were killed in the attack on Pearl Harbor 77 years ago. #PearlHarbor #NeverForget  No one should forget those who sacrificed their lives for our freedoms. Let us remember #PearlHarbor https://t.co/5BaYkU0mlh
I am sure that was the headlines that my grandparents saw in the newspaper on December 8th. My grandfather had to go down to Pearl Harbor leaving his family in Honolulu for several weeks. I knew more about Pearl Harbor thanks to Granddaddy; a retired Naval Capt. https://t.co/wwUcabW52h
As an American, I am eternally grateful for the sacrifice so many made at Pearl Harbor in defense of their country. Then those for the sacrifice those 4 years afterward. Today is a day to honor those 77 years ago at Pearl Harbor. I remember them with honor, dignity, and respect https://t.co/AApw1wuxxS
@AngelMarks4 @realDonaldTrump Our president seems to be hellbent on not honoring those patriots at Pearl Harbor who died defending our country. It is not funny to be seen as a laughing stock to the entire world. We need to put the focus on those who we are to remember today who sacrificed their lives 77 years
@PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump This is a day to remember and honor those who sacrificed their lives for the nation they loved those 77 years ago. It is not a time to tweet about negative politics. This day is honoring our military who died at Pearl Harbor defending our country.
Instead of ranting and raving over politics, this is a time to remember those to sacrificed so much to defend the nation they loved those 77 years ago. It is a day to honor them with dignity. We honor those who sacrificed their lives those 4 years after Pearl Harbor. https://t.co/ezC9IQO20R
On this day 77 years ago, my grandparents, father and aunt awoke to the bombing at Pearl Harbor. Granddaddy was in the Navy commanding submarine tenders. Dad was only 4. How does one explain the horrors of the destruction to a 4 year old? We remember those who sacrificed so much https://t.co/ezC9IQO20R
I hope Tillerson is called by Mueller to tell Mueller all what Trump would ask Tillerson to do that he could legally do. That in itself could bring down @realDonaldTrump ! Oh Happy Day! Happy Days Are Here Again! https://t.co/7vKQVcmcfH

If he turns out to be a one term president, a Democratic president can UNDO everything that @realDonaldTrump has done.

If ths is true, the Democrats might get a good chance to win back the White House.

I'll be happy and millions of Americans will as well https://t.co/e0gWBqHGnr
@johnlundin @politicususa Does this mean that he will be a one term president and we can really go after him for all his crimes while being president? If so, I think most of us will be happy

Gee, I wonder who will be the next chief of staff that @realDonaldTrump will go through and then force to resign like another roll of toilet paper.

@lyonsd777 @theRealDawson83 I also would hope that it is civil. I would hope that whoever is president does show some matter of decency that Trump did not show at President George H.W.Bush's funeral on Wednesday. I certainly hope it is post Trump era when all this takes place.
The perfect picture of the rat-in-chief! He knows he is backed into a corner and that he might not get away with his crimes. No one is above the law. Everyone lives and obeys the same laws.

@BlueSade7 Thank you for the evening laugh about Trump and his cronies being watergate on crack. You are correct that this is no watergate. Personally, I would rather see Trump be impeached, tried and removed from office. I want to see the entire administration removed from the White House
#45 says he wants to get the economy going so people can get decent jobs. decent jobs my foot. To elevate someone with no experience to lead financial industry watchdog will just destroy all what he has been bragging about.

I get a big kick out of Drumpf's supporters saying that Obama was not a patriot. A patriot lays a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Solider regardless of the weather, allows military ballots to be counted and not use our military as a political stunt.  Obama is a patriot. https://t.co/KD5f1pFnbr

@SenFeinstein @Miduswell I hope that the president will review the intelligence, including the tape and will forcefully respond. I don't want to see the Saudi crown prince get away with the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. The Saudi crown prince needs to face the consequences of his actions.

@KikiAdine @TeamPelosi You are correct. Pelosi does not mince words much less play games. The woman is tough and has more intelligence than Ryan. She knows how to get work done and she does not tip toe around the bushes to get issues done. I look forward to seeing her in action again!
Pelosi has more of a backbone than Ryan ever did. At least she can stand up to Trump and his cronies. I look forward to see what the House Democrats will do when it comes to dealing with Trump and his "agenda". https://t.co/F43skXMZKS
I think Trump's state funeral will be at the bare minimum. I am not sure who will talk at his funeral. Whoever is president will probably show as much disrespect as Trump did at yesterday's state funeral for @GeorgeHWBush . There will not be another @GeorgeHWBush again in the GOP https://t.co/uS9TfjPTpN
@theRealDawson83 I imagine it will be at the bare minimum. If he does not (for some reason) go to prison, he will memorialized as an idiot. I am sure that whoever is president will be just as disrespectful at #45's funeral like he was at George H.W. Bush's funeral yesterday.
I would say that Kushner and Trump are in those redactions. In my opinion, I would not be surprised if both of them are getting worried. I have always said that you go after the little fish to get the big fish. We are getting close! https://t.co/oO6vomNvtl
@TimOBrien I would have to say that both names are under those redactions. I know it is better to go after the little fish in order to get to the big fish. I think we are coming close. I do think that Jared and Trump need to begin to worry.
I would assign #45 the job of a dog catcher. I wonder what other jobs someone else would give #45 that would fit his rare skill sets. I mean, being a dog catcher would be perfect in my eyes. Dare we send him to Russia to be a dog catcher there? https://t.co/CxRqEkMLzh

#45 did not show any dignity at George H.W. Bush's funeral yesterday. Such a shameful act of a president. He probably would have done the same thing at the one that occurred this morning. Does #45 want a president to do the same thing at his state funeral? Maybe. https://t.co/QQYiiVBlz8
#GeorgeHWBushFuneral The service has begun and the first reading from Isaiah was just read. Now John Meecham is speaking about the service of our 41 President's in the Navy in World War II and his life after WWII. Bush 41 was America's father as POTUS from 1989-993.
Sounds good to me. If we can implicate as many as possible in this probe, I will be dancing on the roof tops for joy! I would love to see as many as possible be implicated in this probe and put into federal prison for life with NO PAROLE!!!!! https://t.co/t8kYijoMId

@Asmith7130Smith @CaptainResists @ArtistsPo The USA is founded by immigrants. Our fake president and the Greed Over People are the ones who believe that those who seek asylum here is a crime.

I wonder where the Flynn sentencing memo will lead to. Will it produce something to bring a case of impeachment of another president and quite possibly the removal of a second president? Will this fake president be the second one to resign or the first to be convicted? https://t.co/JiNYsS6EtF

Sen McConnell had better let Gina Haspel brief the Senate on the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. I want the full Senate to hear what the CIA director has to say.

@RevLaurieinLex @revlucymeg @WKYT @ABC36News @889WEKU Amen to that. News organizations need to talk with an Episcopal priest about the services for President George H.W. Bush. I hope that they do talk with the Episcopal priest at the church both he and Barbara went to in Houston, TX.

@krassenstein I would say that you are correct. I would say let's get the popcorn out, sit back, enjoy the soap opera and see the comedy routine on SNL this weekend. I can't wait to see Alec Baldwin do his impression of the president on this. I'll be laughing so hard my sides will be hurting
Something tells me we are in for one BIG soap opera with the battle of Trump vs whoever he wants to call liars. Let's get the popcorn out, sit back and enjoy the show. It's going to be a comedy routine on SNL this week! https://t.co/VhU4PJSIoW
How very true that is. It will be called "Trump State run news" https://t.co/IAcCg0NFuR
@3GSprintguy @krassenstein This is so very true. I guess Putin's Crown Prince Trump is following in his master's steps! What do you think?
Can 2020 came faster please!!!!!!! WE need a REAL president not the fake one we have now https://t.co/QnAiCeSKYl
@CyrusMMcQueen I hope he does not lie in state in the Capitol rotunda like one of the better presidents in the GOP.  I am not sure that those of us who did not like this POTUS will remember him too well.
@krassenstein Don't forget, trying to take away our First Amendment Rights. He has already told Federal workers that are not allowed to talk about RESIST or impeachment at work. Since when is our first amendment rights being swept under the rug?
Now this is really interesting. I can't believe that Netanyahu and his wife are being charged with accepting bribes, fraud and breach of trust. And this is an ally of ours? What will happen next? https://t.co/4xL5ymTN9S
@BeautyBind I think Pence is compromised by Russia since he has "stood by" his boss. Pence does not  have the words to speak like his boss. Pence believes in whatever his boss says and does. I can't believe a "smart" man like Pence would believe in all the lies his boss tells everyday.
Since when did our First Amendment rights get swept under the rug? This sounds more like a dictator than a president. I will continue to RESIST until he is impeached. There a way we can get this presidency to go out the door in disgrace like Nixon's? At least Nixon resigned https://t.co/67botpgYLQ
@AdamParkhomenko @lfkraus I bet this will be added to Mueller's Russia probe. It will be interesting to see what will happen to this presidency.
I wonder if this will be added to the Russia probe! Will this help to bring down a president? It will mean a second presidency in my lifetime to be shortened. only this time, impeachment! Will the president resign? that is a good question which right now has no answer. https://t.co/PBkTorFbGz

@SenSchumer I take it that this is a new "Jim Crow" law according to Thomas Farr? I thought we were better than that. Whatever happened to love thy neighbor as thyself? So much for MLK's dream to come true; it is going down the drain because of the way we treat African Americans. Shameful.
Does Thomas Farr really think we are back in the 1940's - 1960's when we had all those Jim Crow laws? I thought we were better than that. I must be wrong. I guess this is a "new" Jim Crow law according to Thomas Farr. Must not be a Christian. Doesn't believe in love thy neighbor https://t.co/YMlX3QGDbM
@realDonaldTrump IS A FRAUD of a president. You always have to "fact check" what he says since he never tells the truth; he doesn't even know what truth is.

Besides being a moron, @realDonaldTrump is a psychopath and a sociopath. It is all about "Me, Myself and I" with him.

@amyklobuchar @SenDuckworth I saw that @realDonaldTrump was upset with GM for laying off workers in Ohio, Michigan and Maryland. Now he wants the bailout money returned. I guess he forgot about that "loophole" when he signed that tax bill. We need our jobs here not overseas. Make America Great Again? Nope.
No wonder GM is laying off workers in Ohio, Michigan and Maryland. It is cheaper to keep their plants open in China and Mexico. Let's forget that we taxpayers bailed them out and this is the thanks we get. We need our jobs here in the United States and not going overseas. https://t.co/IiB16nrdgA
@SenatorCollins has lost all the "respect" I thought I had for her as a senator much less as a female senator.  She's just as bigoted and racist as the psychopath-in-chief. Maybe we need to suppress her right to vote! That would make my day! https://t.co/I5V9XIqrc1
@EdKrassen @LindseyGrahamSC @senatemajldr I want to see @senatemajldr out of the senate. that is for sure.

No backbone in them

@EdKrassen The psychopath-in-chief has mush for brains. He will always believe that those fleeing their own countries are rapists and murderers. Never mind the rapists and murderers here in the United States who are not illegal citizens. Even his sidekick of a joke of a VP does nothing.
This is so very true. FLOTUS' decorations for Christmas in the White House this year come right out of a horror story. It is disrespectful to a joyous season. No one wants to see blood red trees especially in the White House. One wants to see tasteful Christmas trees in the WH. https://t.co/7vjYYUnAKZ
@bubbagump324 I know that I was always taught to say "Merry Christmas". You are correct that FLOTUS is making America terrified to say Merry Christmas ever again. Her decorations in the White House make me sick. This year's decorations are out of a horror story. The trees look like blood!
@votevets @realDonaldTrump This just shows me this disrespect and disdain that the president has for our military. He wants a military parade to honor him, yet he cannot honor those who gave up their lives for our freedoms in these wars that we should not be fighting in the first place especially Iraq.
@realDonaldTrump wants military parades to honor him and yet he shows disrespect and disdain for those who served in the wars in Afghanistan or even Iraq. Not sending his condolences for those we lost in Afghanistan is a disgrace to those families of those who gave their lives. https://t.co/dZrEt9EzGX

@mom_ceo_dj @Miduswell I agree with you! I call for the President of the United States to be held responsible for crimes against humanity. They are so bad that I feel he needs to be sent to the International Criminal Court at the Hague in the Netherlands. Let him face the consequences there.

@DanRather I think it is time for people to begin to take our scientists seriously when it comes to global warming. We humans are destroying the very Earth that God gave us to protect. Our president, the Republican Congress do not understand what climate change is. The Arctic is melting.
@ABFortisEtLiber @DanRather @charlesadler In case you haven't seen in the news, the Arctic is melting. We need to take these scientists seriously. We humans are destroying the very Earth that God gave us to protect. It is quite obvious that you don't seem to understand that. I think Dan Rather understands that.
@HarryBiron No, what we need is CONTROL OVER IDIOTS IN THE Greed Over People. You don't know what on earth you are talking about. You don't seem to care about anything but yourself. You are like the psychopath-in-chief who is UNFIT to be president.
This post is so wrong. It is full of lies. This so called POTUS was given a date as to when he was supposed to deport and reunite the rest of the children, that remain in our country, with their parents. He has yet to do that.

I can't see how much lower we can go except we all know that this psychopath-in-chief will find a way to sink our country even lower.

@realDonaldTrump YOU HAVE NO heart or compassion! This country WAS founded by IMMIGRANTS! They came on the Mayflower. You can not always say immigrants are "stone cold" criminals". Do you understand why they're fleeing all the violence and domestic violence in their countries? NO! You are UNFIT!
@ZupancicJareen @OneWokeWoman @Jim_Jordan What crimes? Try ripping children from their parents' arms and putting them into cages!

"Socialism" should not be seen as a derogatory term. We are called to care for the poor if we actually believe in the teachings of Jesus. There is nothing wrong with caring for our fellow man and woman. https://t.co/KNhH4MZX2S

@AMHotFlash @VoteBlue7 Goes to show you that Vice President Gore knew what he was talking about. Our psychopath-in-chief has no idea what he is talking about when it comes to global warming as well as climate change. Those who are tRump's supporters, and believe the same way, are in for a surprise.
Ivanka Trumps going to China for putting her name on "voting machines" is so dumb. I guess she wants to make sure that "Daddy" gets re-elected in 2020. Someone give me a break. Time to send the entire Trump crime family to Federal Prison and put it on their own island. No money. https://t.co/XtZYThQeQm
@SaysHummingbird Gee, isn't this going against Daddy's trade war with China? Does she really have to embarrass our country by going to China to deal with "trademarks" on voting machines other than making sure that Daddy gets re-elected in 2020.
RT @SaysHummingbird: What does Ivanka plan on doing with her newly awarded Chinese trademarks on voting machines?		RT if you demand answers…
@GeorgeTakei @MartineVriendt I love this. Best laugh I had today. Thank you.
@IamDaBunny @RuleChicago @DeadBunnyFrank Oh, I agree with this. tRump has cost us our dignity, unity and pride. He continues to polarize this country so we see so much hatred and not enough respect for each other. Time for the 25th!
The Saudi's can't be trusted at all. There is no way the United States can trust a Kingdom who has a Crown Prince that orders the murder of a New York Times journalist. They paid people to bring down the towers on 9/11. Can we forget that? Hell NO! https://t.co/8empumzjzf
I hope that everyone had a wonderful Thanksgiving with family and friends. Thanksgiving is a time to slow down and reflect what we can be thankful. I am thankful for my family,friends,health,the beauty that God created. I am also thankful for my Twitter friends.
@cher Hope your Thanksgiving was a special one with family and friends.
@Miduswell @MaxineSykes @realDonaldTrump #Republicans will never understand what the word GLOBAL is. They will never understand what "global warming" is since they see things in tunnel vision. POTUS @realDonaldTrump seeing things in tunnel vision when it comes to Global Warming and he really doesn't care.
Don't ask POTUS OR FLOTUS TRUMP to show up at a kids' concentration camp for a month much less for Christmas. You know how they are: "I am better than they are". They don't have any compassion for these children. #JesusWasAnImmigrant #OurKids #letmypeoplego #letmychildrengo https://t.co/bRPpVQ3ZTz
And we are supposed to trust this psychopath-in-chief with our nuclear codes? This nut case has no idea what the truth is. Those who know what the truth is know that Trump is lying each and every time he tweets or makes a speech. https://t.co/BVlaQdb64z
I hope the House Democrats investigate Ivanka's email problems. If Trump was always saying "Lock Her Up" when it came to Hillary @HillaryClinton email woes, Ivanka can go through that and embarrass her father our psychopath-in-chief should she find herself in trouble with Feds https://t.co/ACSnzz8ed9
@realDonaldTrump , my grandfather, who was a career naval captain, would be embarrassed by your actions! You embarrass the military by your actions toward it. Discrimination was not in my grandfather's vocabulary. It is in yours. Shame on you. https://t.co/i6QKK0CKly
These people don't us very well, do they? The resistance will continue so we can get Trump out of office one way or another. I hope it is impeachment; if not that, voting him out in the 2020 election. Then we can throw him into jail! Let's get back to work so we can win in 2020. https://t.co/HChY0jwQe5
So very true! The big cheese in our psychopath-in-chief. He's racist, sexist, not to mention a pervert. No wonder he represents the Grumpy Old Perverts so well. The GOP has several new names: Grumpy Old Perverts; Greed Over People; Government of Putin. https://t.co/H6fVSPkReU
@OneWokeWoman @Jim_Jordan Best post I have seen. Thank you. Let's send him to the International Criminal Court at the Hague in the Netherlands. He's done more crimes that would be perfect for that court.
Do people remember his "LOCK HER UP" about Hillary Clinton? I think we can safely say the table has been turned on Trump. LOCK HIM UP! LOCK HIM UP! He deserves whatever sentence he gets. PUT him on trial in the International Criminal Court at the Hague. LOCK HIM UP! https://t.co/H6fVSPkReU
