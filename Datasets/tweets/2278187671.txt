@PolicingEquity I've seen hundreds of cases of officer misconduct and the partiality of these policies, hard to fire officers.
Over the last half century, we've seen the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on some very important cases which shift the paradigm of police powers.
Officer Bill of rights, One-Sided Contract via Collective Bargaining, and Police Union Protection. Above the law indeed! #ZeroAccountability
State of the City https://t.co/nu6iZzASlz
@DarwinBondGraha To my point, there are so many protections that the officer gets regardless of extreme misconduct. Zero accountability.
Part of the issue is that police officers are trained to enforce laws &amp; policies--kind of like robots, so they don't see the bigger picture.
