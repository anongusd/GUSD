Despite warnings from our top intelligence and military leaders, the Kremlin's efforts to weaken our institutions have continued with insufficient action by the admin or Congress to strengthen cyber defenses, safeguard election systems, and deter further destabilizing activities.

With rising threats around the world &amp; a readiness crisis endangering service members’ lives, Congress must provide sufficient, stable funding for our military with a long-term, bipartisan budget agreement #passabudget
Under a #continuingresolution, the military will be locked into outdated &amp; inadequate funding levels, training, maintenance &amp; modernization will be stalled &amp; service members’ lives will be put in danger #passabudget
Under #shutdown, service members will continue working, but won’t be paid. Key missions will experience disruptions, benefits will stop going to families of the fallen &amp; many maintenance activities will stop #passabudget
Secretary Mattis’s newly released National Defense Strategy – aimed at addressing the readiness crisis &amp; restoring our military advantage – is meaningless if we can’t fund it #passabudget

People have come to this country from everywhere, and people from everywhere have made America great. Our immigration policy should reflect that truth, and our elected officials, including our President, should respect it.
Respect for the God-given dignity of every human being, no matter their race, ethnicity or other circumstances of their birth, is the essence of American patriotism. To believe otherwise is to oppose the very idea of America.

I urge @POTUS to sign #FY18NDAA into law &amp; acknowledge this is the level of defense spending necessary to confront challenges of a dangerous world. Huge bipartisan majorities of both House &amp; Senate agree!
FY18 started nearly 2 months ago. We cannot delay any further in appropriating these vital resources for our military -- it would be an abdication of our responsibility.
We must not delay in appropriating these vital resources for our military. Any further delay would be an abdication of our responsibility.
