Instead, he has manufactured a crisis in his efforts to create a reaction based on fear by lying about immigrants, falsely accusing Democrats of organizing this caravan, and by sending an outrageous and unnecessary amount of troops to the southern border.

We must ban military grade weapons, close background check loopholes, and make it harder to acquire firearms NOW.  Too many lives were lost in a senseless act of violence. This must stop.
Our country is in the midst of a thick cloud of anti-semitism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, Islamophobia, and hatred runs deep with some of our citizens. It runs so deep, those filled with hatred of others are emboldened by the ease of acquiring weapons in this country.
The hatred that led to the attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh should make all of us want to work tirelessly to eradicate hate and work for common sense gun reform.

@FoxNews Rather, we should all care that so much of our history is repeating itself, and it shouldn't. We should make a difference now, because we can.
@FoxNews Thank you to Crystal Echohawk for putting some of these frustrations into words. Our public discourse about Indian country should not come up just because one woman decided to find out more about her family history...
@FoxNews Many families along the way became uprooted, never made it back home, or maybe went home to find their community had vanished because of disease, a need to escape, or maybe because they could not sustain themselves any longer.
@FoxNews Most Americans are not knowledgeable of the struggles Indians have faced and continue to face, and not just with their right to govern themselves. Native Americans have suffered genocide, family separation, and continue to suffer from unspeakable crimes against women and children
@FoxNews I respect that, and respect every Tribe's absolute right to determine Tribal membership. My daughter isn't a tribal member, but she is my daughter and she identifies as a Pueblo woman, because she is.
@FoxNews My daughter is a Pueblo woman. She grew up in a Pueblo household, learning our family history, culture, and traditions. That being said, she doesn't meet the blood quantum to be an enrolled member of my Tribe.
This is the loudest conversation about Native Americans since Standing Rock. It's unfortunate that so many are missing the mark and resorting to outright racism and stereotypes (mostly @FoxNews), rather than taking just a minute to educate themselves about our history. https://t.co/be7MO1GjvC

Today more Native American candidates are running for office than ever before, and we intend to fight to win back any rights that have been similarly stripped from us. In Congress, I vow to take this issue head on.
Yet, my people were unable to participate in elections at certain points in their lives. Now --  access to the ballot has just been stripped, yet again, from Native American North Dakotans, and it is absolutely shameful
Native Americans couldn‚Äôt vote in our country until they were deemed ‚ÄòUS citizens‚Äô in 1924, and in cases like my home state of New Mexico, we have only had the right to vote since 1948. We are indigenous to this land...
The Supreme Court Justices know that many Native American voters living on tribal lands do not have street addresses, and in requiring a street address to vote discriminates against them, which snatches democracy from their very hands.
Tuesday's US Supreme Court Decision in Brakebill v. Jaegar further disenfranchises Native American voters whose voices have never been adequately represented in our government. #NativeVote18 https://t.co/uF8qBaFVte

Brett Kavanaugh‚Äôs appointment to a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court will have devastating consequences for communities across the United States for decades to come.
The GOP has appointed a man who believes birth control is abortion and that abortion is illegal to the highest court in the land, an institution that is meant to protect and represent the freedoms of all people -- men, women, and children of every race, religion, and ethnicity.
Today‚Äôs vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court was disappointing, with an  impact that will reverberate for decades to come. In particular, Mr. Kavanaugh‚Äôs confirmation sends a clear message to women and girls: you don‚Äôt matter. #BelieveSurvivors #TakeItBack

His repeated lies under oath, and his inability to take any responsibility for his actions ‚Äîeven those documented in his own yearbook ‚Äî only add to these concerns.
Kavanaugh‚Äôs testimony today was deeply disturbing. His willingness to yell at, badger, and ignore sitting US Senators who are women point to deeply disqualifying character flaws.
Brett Kavanaugh appears to believe he is entitled to a seat on the Supreme Court ‚Äîbut he is not. Survivors have risked their lives to speak up about his character, and our nation owes them a great debt.

I hear the anger from voters every single day. Nobody wants more laws that make it more difficult for families to live, to eat, to find healthcare, or to simply love. Nobody wants to see children separated from their parents or people barred from traveling to our country.
The Supreme Court vacancy is the most consequential in our lifetime, but this nominee is from an A-list of extremists, out of touch with reality.
Women, people of color, and so many other marginalized communities¬†deserve a strong voice, not someone who has the power to destroy critical wins on¬†women's reproductive rights, healthcare, marriage equality, unions, and civil rights, at the drop of a hat.

With families in peril, we have to take action now. Join me at a rally against family detention, post on social media to #FreeOurFuture, and donate a few dollars today to help immigrant families with their legal bills. Together, we will resist. And together, we will win.
To my undocumented immigrant friends, family, and neighbors: I see you, I love you, and I honor how you make America strong and beautiful.
In Congress, I‚Äôll fight to keep families together, and I‚Äôll fight to keep families out of Trump's detention camps. We must ensure asylum seekers -- including men, women, and children -- can enter the United States without threat of torture, prison, or family separation.
I‚Äôm calling for the resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Nielsen. She has been a failure in her leadership over this crisis. It is also time to defund ICE -- an agency that is out of bounds in its efforts to terrorize families.
The Trump Administration's white supremacist agenda is out of control -- and I stand against detention camps for families, the imprisonment of children, and the criminalization of asylum seekers.
Regardless of President Trump‚Äôs new executive order, children do not belong in cages. Families do not belong in detention camps or prisons.
What Donald Trump is doing to immigrant families is heartbreaking, cruel, inhumane, and a human rights crime. #FreeOurFuture

In Congress, I will fight to change the rules because no person or family should have to choose between paying for their prescription drugs and putting food on the table.
The life of a person that has access to prescription drugs should not be valued over someone who cannot afford them. The lives and health of our citizens should not be held hostage by corporate drug companies that profit more than any other industry.
Prescription drugs are critical to the health of so many Americans. It is time that we start seeing life-saving prescription drugs as human rights, not items for profit.

We must demand a permanent solution for Dreamers and an end to the detention and deportation practices that are ripping families apart and putting children's lives in danger.
Through no fault of their own, the livelihoods of 800,000 dreamers are in jeopardy. President Trump's approach of building walls and tent cities while knocking down young immigrants' chances at the American Dream is despicable.

I am proud to be a part of the effort last year that banned the hateful practice of conversion therapy in New Mexico. I'll be just as fierce in Congress as I fight to ban this practice across our nation--and support full equality for all LGBTQ people.
In the Trump era, when too many people are facing increasingly hateful violence--specifically in the black, brown, Native American, and the LGBTQ communities--I will fight for justice, dignity, and safety for marginalized communities.
As we celebrate Pride Month, we must also remember that LGBTQ people can still be evicted from their homes, fired from their jobs, and denied services because of who they are or who they love.

I am honored to have the endorsement LaDonna Harris, a member of the board of directors of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. I look forward to serving as the first Native American woman in Congress standing up to Trump's attacks.
If elected to Congress, I will protect this covenant for all generations and stand up for our seniors. A solid and stable foundation for retirement security is a right not a privilege.
I believe Social Security and Medicare are the cornerstone of these promises. I strongly support expanding Medicare, strengthening Social Security, and lowering prescription drug prices.
In this nation, we make promises to one another: when you retire, you will not age in poverty; when you are sick, you will receive health care; and when you have fallen on hard times, this nation will find a way to help pick you up.
In honor of Older Americans Month, I thought it was a good time remember that Americans believe in the covenant made between our government and its citizens. https://t.co/FBfCNKXi1e

They remain our leaders, our teachers, our neighbors and our friends. Not bad for a band of believers who have been tested from the moment that they came together and professed their faith. The Jewish people have always persevered.
For hundreds of years, Jewish Americans have fought heroically in battle and inspired us to pursue peace. They‚Äôve built our cities, cured our sick. They‚Äôve paved the way in the sciences and the law, in our politics and in the arts.
"This month is a chance for Americans of every faith to appreciate the contributions of the Jewish people throughout our history ‚Äì- often in the face of unspeakable discrimination and adversity.
Jewish leaders have fought for centuries for worker‚Äôs rights, women‚Äôs equality and civil rights for all. As I reflect on the solemnity of this month, and the continuing anti-Semitism so many suffer, I wanted to share this powerful statement from President Obama from May of 2011.

Trump‚Äôs very use of Pocahontas‚Äô name is disrespectful. Her story is heart-wrenching. In my culture, we have deep respect for relatives who have gone before us.
