He was unyielding in his demand for American taxpayers to pay billions to build a wall he promised Mexico would pay for, and he failed to reassure federal workers that their lives wouldn‚Äôt be thrown into chaos by another government shutdown.

The ball is firmly in @senatemajldr‚Äôs court. But rather than taking up the House-passed legislation, he is watching from the sidelines as this shutdown continues. He‚Äôs holding up the legislative process to satisfy the President‚Äôs whims.
The House has already passed bipartisan legislation ‚Äì H.R. 21 and House Joint Resolution 1 ‚Äì to end this shutdown, reopen shuttered agencies and fund the Department of Homeland Security through February 8th. @senatemajldr has the power to bring that legislation up for a vote.
Federal workers aren‚Äôt leverage. They‚Äôre the men and women who serve our communities and provide vital services to Americans. They aren‚Äôt enjoying a paid vacation, as one White House adviser callously put it. They‚Äôre paying the price for the President‚Äôs govern-by-chaos approach.

We should not be abdicating to the Executive Branch. We should be doing our job.	 	Let‚Äôs open this government. Let‚Äôs show these federal workers that they aren‚Äôt political pawns.
We know we can pass legislation to open the government. We did it in the last Congress. It‚Äôs the president‚Äôs decision whether to accept/veto. If he decides to veto it, we should override. The founders and framers set up a process so that no one branch of government has control.
The shutdown is threatening wildlife and public safety because staff are furloughed and federal contractors aren‚Äôt getting paid. Important projects are delayed and services Nevadans rely on have been halted.
This is only one of the major impacts on Nevadans. It‚Äôs not the only major disruption we‚Äôre seeing. I spoke today with Nevadans who work at the BLM, U.S. Fish and Wildlife, U.S. Geological Survey and USDA Rural Development.
A single mom told me that she recently moved to Nevada after getting her dream job. She used her savings to move and buy a house. Without the certainty of a paycheck, she asked me, ‚Äúhow do I pay the bills, support my mother and my 8-year-old?‚Äù
I spoke with parents who both work for the federal government and are not receiving any income. They have four children. Given the uncertainty of when the government will re-open, they have no idea how they could support their family without any pay.
The consensus I heard from federal workers is simple: re-open the government. Thousands of Nevada‚Äôs federal workers are worried about paying the bills, supporting their children and keeping up with their mortgage payments.
This morning, I‚Äôm going to hear from Nevadans whose families and finances are being thrown into chaos because of President Trump‚Äôs senseless shutdown. Follow along this thread for updates.

The solution is simple: reopen the government. Stop holding federal workers hostage for political gain. They are not political pawns. They are not leverage. Let‚Äôs show federal workers the respect and dignity they deserve.
They signed up to serve the American people. They deserve the certainty of a functioning gov't and a steady paycheck. These are people who do an honest day‚Äôs work and expect a steady paycheck and a gov't led by a president who cares about their needs and their family‚Äôs safety.
I‚Äôve heard from many federal workers in Nevada. They didn‚Äôt ‚Äúsign up‚Äù to live in constant fear that their paychecks may be withheld for political gain; to wonder if they will be able to pay their rent on time, cover childcare costs or put food on the table for their families.
Our President‚Äôs govern-by-chaos approach has pulled the rug from under hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors across the country who are currently furloughed or being forced to work without pay, including over 3,000 in Nevada.

I‚Äôm continuing to fight for Nevadans who expect common sense from their government and for a bipartisan solution that ends the Trump shutdown.
Americans deserve better than the uncertainty and disruption of the Trump shutdown. They deserve a government that puts their interests first and works together to find solutions.
President Trump caved to the demands of his rightwing critics and put partisan politics above the best interests of Americans by triggering a partial government shutdown.
I cannot take a salary during a government shutdown knowing that so many federal workers in Nevada and across the country will go without pay. I‚Äôll be donating my salary to a Nevada charity for every day of the Trump shutdown.
Sadly, President Trump has brought our country into yet another crisis right before the holidays. We should be working together to end to this shutdown.
We must remain committed to protecting the border through the use of new technology and updating existing infrastructure, while holding this administration accountable.
According to a GAO report, Customs and Border Protection has not even studied the effectiveness of new barriers or their estimated costs ‚Äì a potential waste of billions in taxpayer dollars and opening up the process to graft and mismanagement without proper oversight.
Democrats support border security ‚Äì we always have, but we will not sit idly by while President Trump manufactures a crisis and wastes billions of American taxpayer dollars. He must work to find common ground and sign a bipartisan compromise that both Ds and Rs can agree to.
The Senate has worked together in a bipartisan way to get the funds necessary for the DHS to do their job and protect Americans. Our bipartisan legislation includes funding for programs that truly protect Americans and strengthen the southern border.
Congrats to @unevadareno on this well-earned distinction. Go Pack! https://t.co/61QavHGw0T
President Trump said previously that American taxpayers would not have to pay for his wall. Now, he is focused on shutting down the government to force taxpayers to pay $5 billion for an ineffective border wall.

I have no confidence that Judge Brett Kavanaugh will approach cases with the impartiality &amp; restraint required of a Supreme Court Justice.
In his belligerent testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Brett Kavanaugh accused Democratic Senators of conspiring against him &amp; made veiled threats of revenge. He was arrogant &amp; hostile towards anyone who asked him to elaborate on his past experiences.
I‚Äôm profoundly disappointed the Senate confirmed Judge Brett Kavanaugh today. I believe based on his record &amp; testimony his stance on a woman‚Äôs right to choose is extreme &amp; disqualifies him from a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court.

As a former Attorney General, I know how critical it is to know all of the facts in a case. Senate Republicans have overseen a flawed confirmation process &amp; the arbitrary limits imposed by the Trump Administration has severely limited the scope of this investigation.

Let's be clear: #JudgeKavanaugh is not entitled to this seat. This is a crucial decision to make on a lifetime appointment. We should be taking our time. This shouldn't be rushed. There's no statutory deadline we must meet. This must be thorough. We need all the facts before us.
Reopening the FBI background investigation on #JudgeKavanaugh to provide more information about these serious allegations is the right thing to do. Part of our advise &amp; consent role as senators is examining his fitness to sit on the #SCOTUS - &amp; that includes his character.

This is about whether we're confirming #JudgeKavanaugh to a lifetime appointment on the highest court in the land, our most revered institution. This is about determining whether he's fit to sit on the #SCOTUS - &amp; part of that is a thorough examination of his character.

Perhaps Mr. Cohn should look in the mirror and see who exactly is culpable for the financial collapse that ruined the lives of countless Nevadans. Spoiler: it isn‚Äôt the waitress from Las Vegas.
Las Vegans earn an honest living in pursuit of the American dream. And before Dodd-Frank, banks and executives like Gary Cohn were misleading consumers and borrowers to take on more than what they can to profit from them.
In the interview, Cohn said, ‚ÄúWho broke the law? I just want to know who you think broke the law. Was the waitress in Las Vegas who had six houses leveraged at 100 percent with no income, was she reckless and stupid? Or was the banker reckless and stupid?‚Äù

From his challenge of #RoeVWade as "settled law‚Äô" to his far-fetched dissent denying a 17-year-old undocumented immigrant in detention from accessing an abortion, I have no doubt that #JudgeKavanaugh's confirmation would tip the balance of the Supreme Court to end Roe v. Wade.

As Americans, we value our kids. We do no harm to kids. But because of @realDonaldTrump's heinous border policy, over 2,500 children remain separated from their parents. My, @SenKamalaHarris, &amp; @SenJeffMerkley's #REUNITEAct will reunify these families now. https://t.co/bMGSXatUmo
I told those parents that I would bring their stories back to DC &amp; that people in this country are fighting for them ‚Äì that‚Äôs what the #REUNITEAct is about. We do not stop fighting. This is about who we are as Americans &amp; what we‚Äôre projecting to the world #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/qJbyHW23Qk
This admin sorted these families like they were cattle. It was disgusting &amp; inhumane. And whether you‚Äôre a parent or not ‚Äì we all know this is not who we are as a country. This admin never had the intention of reuniting these families. Never ever. There was no plan. #REUNITEAct https://t.co/2CkOEdEgU6
When I went to our southern border three weeks ago, I talked with six mothers &amp; four fathers at an @ICEgov facility ‚Äì each one asked me the same thing: they asked me "where their child is, what was going on in the outside world, &amp; how long were they going to be locked up for?" https://t.co/2tapkbl4cf
As Americans, we value our kids. As Americans, we do no harm to kids. We do no harm. It‚Äôs outrageous what this admin has done.

President Trump should work with Democrats to solve the refugee crisis in Central America &amp; stop treating innocent children as political pawns. We must continue to fight like hell for these families every single day &amp; keep raising our voices until every family is reunited.
Passing the #REUNITEAct would put an end to the human rights crisis at our southern border, &amp; I hope my colleagues will join us in supporting it. But let me be clear: Congress did not create this crisis. This crisis falls solely on @realDonaldTrump's shoulders.
The #REUNITEAct would 1) prohibit the admin from detaining children indefinitely; 2) prevent the admin from deporting parents before their children's immigration proceeding; &amp; 3) direct the AG, DHS &amp; HHS Secs to establish an "Office for Locating &amp; Reuniting Children w/ Parents"
All the women I spoke w/ experienced the same thing. They all faced horrific gang violence &amp; abuse in their home country. They fled to save their lives. That's why @SenKamalaHarris @SenJeffMerkley &amp; myself have introduced the #REUNITEAct, requiring immediate reunification.
The parents I spoke to had no information. They were asking me if I knew where their kids were. I told them that I didn‚Äôt, &amp; that I was asking those same questions. I promised the parents that I would take their stories back with me to D.C. to do something to help.
The Trump admin gave no thought to the damage inflicted on these families &amp; these children. They ripped these kids out of their parents‚Äô arms with no plan to reunite them. They never planned to. And now the trauma they've experienced will be with them for a lifetime.
These women came to this country seeking freedom &amp; protection for themselves &amp; their children. But instead, they were arrested &amp; thrown in a jail cell. Their children were put on buses &amp; driven away. #FamiliesBelongTogether
I sat down one mother named Ana. After her &amp; her 5 yo daughter witnessed a brutal murder, they fled their home country to keep them safe. When they got here, they were torn apart. They locked her up &amp; took her daughter. These stories should outrage anyone.
Three weeks ago, I traveled to our southern border. I wanted to see for myself how these children were being treated. I was locked out! They wouldn't even let me in. And then I went to an ICE detention facility - it was no different than a prison I've seen in NV.
Today, I'm joining @SenKamalaHarris @SenJeffMerkley to send a clear message to the Trump admin: ripping away kids from their parents at the border &amp; holding them behind bars indefinitely is unacceptable. It is inhumane. And it is not who we are as Americans #FamiliesBelongTogther

This admin has suggested that the reunification process is so slow b/c too many Members of Congress are taking tours of these facilities. I couldn't help but laugh when I heard that.

.@realDonaldTrump, work with Democrats to solve the refugee crisis in Central America. Don‚Äôt treat innocent children &amp; their parents as political pawns. Don‚Äôt turn your back on everything this country stands for. #FamiliesBelongTogether
Locking-up families who are seeking asylum under laws we have put in place will be a moral stain on our country for generations. @realDonaldTrump, the American people demand that you explain how you plan to reunite these families that you‚Äôve scarred forever &amp; ripped apart.
We do not tear babies out of their mother‚Äôs arms. We‚Äôve always had a guiding principle when it comes to children. We do no harm. Whether they‚Äôre Honduran children, or Guatemalan children, or Salvadoran children, or American children. We do no harm. #FamiliesBelongTogether
The physiological trauma they‚Äôve inflicted on these children will last a lifetime. I‚Äôm calling on President Trump to finally do his job &amp; provide us with a concrete plan. I want to see results. I won‚Äôt stop fighting until every child has been reunited with their parents!
The Trump admin can‚Äôt pin the blame for this on Congress, Democrats, or anyone else. They‚Äôre missing their deadlines for one reason &amp; one reason only: because they never made a plan to reunite these families. They never intended to. Two weeks later - they still have no plan.
The Trump admin's suggested that the reunification process is slow because too many Members of Congress are taking tours of these detention facilities. I couldn't help but laugh when I heard that. I tried to enter a children's detention facility &amp; they locked me out!
In the midst of this, @HHSGov discovered that they've been holding a toddler who may be a U.S. citizen in detention for over a year. How could this be possible? How could the reunification process be so erratic, inefficient, &amp; slow? This admin's been making excuses left &amp; right.
Three different entities in the Trump admin's working to reunify families. But none of them are working together! Now, the admin has missed its court-ordered deadline to reunite children under five. And as far as we know, out of 102 children, only four of them have been reunited.
Secretary Azar testified recently that there is ‚Äúno reason why any parent would not know where their child is located.‚Äù Not true. I spoke with 10 mothers &amp; fathers who had no clue where their kids were. They had tears running down their faces as they pleaded with me to help them.
Because of @realDonaldTrump's inhumane family separation policy, we have over 3,000 children separated from their parents. Their moms &amp; dads just want to have their children back in their arms.
All six of the women I talked to at the detention facility fled to the U.S. expecting to find freedom &amp; protection. Instead, they were thrown in jail &amp; their children were loaded on buses &amp; taken away. Now, these mothers desperately want to know where their children are.
I asked the group of women why they can't go to the police. They explained that the police are just as corrupt as the gangs. In their countries, there's no rule of law. If you want to save your children's lives, your only option is to flee. And that's what these women did.
Each one of them I spoke with had kids 12 &amp; under who were taken from them. Their stories were the same; they had all faced horrific gang violence &amp; abuse in their home country - &amp; fled to protect their family. They had been raped &amp; tortured. They watched loved ones get murdered
Ana traveled 3,000 miles to get to our Southern border. When she finally arrived, she thought, ‚ÄúOh my god, I‚Äôm finally safe. I‚Äôm going to tell them who I am and why I‚Äôm here.‚Äù When she did, she was arrested &amp; her daughter was put on a bus &amp; driven hundreds of miles away.
I went to an ICE detention facility &amp; sat down with six mothers whose children had been separated from them. One of them was Ana, who has a 5-year-old daughter. After witnessing a brutal murder in her neighborhood, she decided to leave the country in order to keep them safe.

We must use every tool we have to ensure we‚Äôre fighting for a qualified, balanced, &amp; independent-minded nominee. We must also fight to ensure the American people‚Äôs voices are heard in the November elections &amp; only consider a #SCOTUS nominee after the new Congress is seated.
But let me be clear here: Nothing less than a woman's right to choose is on the line with this vacant Supreme Court seat.
Justice Kennedy honored his oath to support &amp; defend our Constitution &amp; faithfully discharged his duties as a Justice on the #SCOTUS for 30 years. While I have not agreed with every decision he has signed his name to, I honor his service &amp; wish him the best in his retirement.
We are a country of values &amp; laws. One of the things we value are our children. Whether they‚Äôre ours or someone else‚Äôs. We do no harm to children. What the Trump admin's doing at the border flies in the face of this. More from my border trip w/ @KNPRnews https://t.co/NE9l71tdQp

The choice of the detainees I spoke to was to either stay in their home country &amp; be killed - or their children be killed &amp; raped - or come to this country where we have asylum laws. Pres. Trump has done away w/ this now &amp; it's not who we are as a country https://t.co/Sd1nl8BGwF
The detainees @ICEgov Port Isabel Detention Facility told me that authorities would change the TV channel when news about family separation came on. When I told them that a majority of this country knows what this admin is doing - &amp; are outraged - they smiled. They had no idea.
I'm not sure how anybody could not have listened to the stories I heard &amp; have a dry eye - &amp; not want to protect these kids &amp; reunify them w/ their families. These mothers were told either you put your child on a bus or @ICEgov is going to. Makes me sick what this admin has done.

@SenWhitehouse @MurrayEnergyC @realDonaldTrump @EPAScottPruitt @EPA Our country is in danger with a climate change denier like Wheeler. He will be another special interest lobbyist on top that's in the back pocket of #BigPolluters. He use to work for one of the biggest ones! We don't need another bad actor in charge.
@SenWhitehouse @MurrayEnergyC @realDonaldTrump It is scary. Wheeler would become @EPAScottPruitt #2. The same guy who sued the @EPA 14 times before heading the agency, has spent his time undermining science &amp; who said pulling out of the #ParisAgreement was a decision "right for this country from an environmental perspective."
.@realDonaldTrump's nomination of Andrew Wheeler as @EPA's #2 is a clear sign the polluters are in charge &amp; the days of clean air &amp; water are numbered. And who will suffer? Our children, seniors &amp; families. @SenWhitehouse, as a climate &amp; clean energy champion, what do you think?
As if Mick Mulvaney's contempt of the @CFPB wasn't already clear ‚Äì in January, he requested a grand total of zero dollars to fund the agency he's supposed to run. 		Not exactly what you'd expect from someone dedicated to the mission of #ProtectConsumers. https://t.co/iflbHdYZXR

@ChrisVanHollen That's right. #EqualPay for equal work is essential for women to achieve economic security &amp; this gap makes it harder for too many women in both Nevada &amp; Maryland to put food on the table, pay mounting bills, save for a secure retirement, or get ahead in today‚Äôs economy.
@ChrisVanHollen Not fairly paying women for the same work of their white male colleagues is just plain wrong. It is unconscionable that women still have to work 100 additional days to earn what their male colleagues make in a year. #EqualPayDay
This #EqualPayDay, @ChrisVanHollen &amp; I will be tweeting about how absurd it is that the gender pay gap still exists. We will not tolerate blatant discrimination against women.
On average, women are paid just 80 cents to every $1 of their white male colleagues. This is ridiculous &amp; wrong. 		This #EqualPayDay, I urge my colleagues to stand up for families &amp; our economy by passing the #PaycheckFairness Act. https://t.co/rK1oP8nXF8

Like you, I'm devastated &amp; outraged by the #ParklandShooting. But I'm committed to help prevent the slaughtering of our children &amp; mass murders due to gun violence. 		If you're tired of Congresses failure to act, RT to show your Members of Congress they'll be hearing from you!
A bipartisan solution to protect #Dreamers &amp; grant them the pathway to citizenship they've earned was on the table. It failed b/c GOP leadership voted instead to continue enabling @realDonaldTrump's xenophobic agenda. To Dreamers: This isn't it. I will not stop fighting for you.
Two brave students who survived the #ParklandShooting puts it all into perspective, wondering why Congress has done nothing to protect them from gun violence. They're right. We have an obligation to take care of our children &amp; keep them safe. And right now, we're failing them. https://t.co/65RDqcMlrn
.@realDonaldTrump addressed the nation - and didn't even utter the words "gun violence." @SpeakerRyan says we need to "take a breath" - suggesting it is not the time to talk about gun violence. Now is precisely the time. In fact, it's past time. Congress must act to save lives. https://t.co/TJ78SumaZu
My vote was one to protect nearly two million #Dreamers from deportation from the only country they've ever known. I voted for a future that is still bright, diverse, &amp; bold. Yet, by voting down this bipartisan legislation, the GOP leadership has enabled @POTUS' xenophobic agenda https://t.co/cAH7Je74in
#ParklandShooting is the 18th school shooting just this year - &amp; it's only February. No, we can't stop every shooting, but there are commonsense steps Congress can take to prevent the slaughtering of children &amp; these senseless mass murders. Congress just needs to step up &amp; do it.
This week, we're debating the fate of 800,000 #Dreamers on the Senate floor &amp; what we're going to do to protect them. I joined my friend, @maziehirono - an immigrant herself - to discuss what's happening in the Senate right now #ProtectDreamers 		WATCH --&gt; https://t.co/Se4fmIUgQj

.@realDonaldTrump's budget is nothing less than an assault on the healthcare of Nevadan's by cutting hundreds of billions from #Medicare &amp; ending #Medicaid as we know it.

Trump rescinded #DACA unleashing fear in the hearts of 800k #Dreamers. GOP then refused to fund #CHIP, which 9 million children rely on for care. Now, the GOP is holding both hostage &amp; forcing Dems to pick which to save in order to keep the gov't open. This crisis is on the GOP.

My office has received 1,085 calls &amp; 15,271 letters on the #GOPTaxScam. @SenateGOP @HouseGOP if you're curious where Nevadans stand on your bill for the top 1% &amp; big corporations - the numbers speak for themselves:	 	9.6% in favor	90.4% are OPPOSED	 	No doubt. This bill is a scam
11 Republican and Democratic governors deliver a strong message to Congress: A bipartisan solution is needed urgently to protect #DACA recipients - who are losing their protection everyday - from deportation &amp; being torn from their families. #DreamActNow https://t.co/v8ZemGHdPt
In the early hours of the morning, @SenateGOP gave a giant tax cut to big corporations - like the #BigBanks &amp; #BigOil - &amp; the top 1%, ignoring decades of their own fiscal responsibility gospel. Our kids will be paying for this $1.5 trillion corporate giveaway for decades to come. https://t.co/4cW0hn5D6I
Angela, from Las Vegas, is a #DACA recipient who is now at risk of deportation and being torn apart from her family if the GOP fails to pass #DreamActNow.

@ChrisMurphyCT @JohnCornyn @SenFeinstein We cannot ignore the lives of those murdered or wounded at #SandyHook, #1October and every other mass shooting.

@ChrisMurphyCT @JohnCornyn I'm also a co-sponsor of @SenFeinstein's bill to ban bump stocks, a device that turns a semi-automatic rifle into an even deadlier weapon to kill as many people as possible. These devices do not belong in our communities. We must pass this bill to reduce gun violence &amp; save lives
@ChrisMurphyCT That is why I'm a proud co-sponsor of @ChrisMurphyCT @JohnCornyn's bipartisan bill to fix inefficiencies in the national background check system, so that violent criminals and domestic abusers will not be able to purchase a gun from registered dealers. #HonorWithAction
.@ChrisMurphyCT has said the issue of gun violence found him after the massacre at #SandyHook. I am devastated to say the issue of gun violence has found me, too, after #1October. Like him, I'm making it my mission to prevent tragedies like these from ever happening again.
The right to own a gun must be balanced by the right of every American to be able to go out in public without fearing they‚Äôll be shot and killed at Church. Or in a movie theatre. Or in a classroom. Or at a night club. Or on a baseball field. Or at a concert.

@amprog It‚Äôs time to recognize that #Dreamers are Americans. That their stories are no different from any of ours. That by taking away their protections, by allowing them to return to the shadows, we are allowing a vicious cycle to grind 800,000 dreams into the dust. #DreamActNow
@amprog My mom &amp; dad worked all their lives so that my sister and I could become the first in our family to earn a college degree. My family taught me that when someone opens a door for you, you hold it open for the next person coming along after. That's why I'm here. #DreamActNow

@amprog We are a nation of immigrants. But we are caught in a vicious cycle. We look to our ancestors for inspiration. We benefit from the contributions of immigrants. But every generation, we default to the arrogance of power, and treat immigrants as scapegoats, and shut them out.
@amprog The 800,000 #Dreamers in this country don‚Äôt want special treatment. They want the chance to live their lives and do all of those things, without the fear of deportation looming over their heads. #DreamActNow

Latest in the #GOPTaxScam: Ripping affordable healthcare away from 13 million Americans in order for the GOP to give their biggest fans (big corporations and the uber-wealthy) a giveaway they do not need. 		We've been down this road. Enough with the #ACASabotage already. https://t.co/kMWszLkCov
.@SenateMajLdr admits "you can't guarantee that absolutely no one sees a tax increase." 		Translation: the middle class will see tax increases, all to pay for tax breaks for corporations &amp; the wealthy. There is something seriously wrong with this picture.
The GOP was right about one thing, their plan is easy. Both House and Senate plans have just two steps: cut taxes for the wealthy now and pay for tax cuts later by cutting the programs that Nevada's working families rely on. #GOPTaxScam
How could the #GOPTaxScam help you and your family when their proposal was designed to help the wealthy and America's biggest corporations? 		Tell the GOP to go back to the drawing board and work across the aisle to give meaningful relief to hardworking American families.

@realDonaldTrump I want every DREAMer to know something: You are not alone. You belong here. You are American.
.@realDonaldTrump's action to rescind #DACA &amp; threaten deportation of 800,000 #DREAMers is bad for our country's safety, bad for our economy, and bad for Nevada.
DREAMers represent the very best of us - every single DREAMer - and I have met with so many in NV, they work hard. They put themselves through school. They serve our country. They support their families. And they make better lives for themselves &amp; their communities in Nevada.
Veterans Day is Saturday, but for the nearly 900 DREAMers serving in our military, it's a reminder that their Commander-In-Chief does not honor their service. He's told them their service to America &amp; their patriotism is not wanted.
I'm here today to send a clear message to the DREAMers back home in NV, and throughout the country: I hear you, I stand with you, and together we will make sure Congress passes the #DreamActNow
Nearly 900 brave DREAMers have answered the call to serve to defend our country and keep Americans safe. Now, they face deportation b/c their Commander-In-Chief has rescinded #DACA. I call on @SenateGOP to honor their service and pass the #DreamActNow https://t.co/LNDygdv68i

Loopholes in our background checks system make us all less safe. Congress must pass the Background Check Expansion Act to reduce gun safety https://t.co/74T1t1Slzg
Background checks work, but major loopholes mean that ¬º of all guns are acquired without one. Congress must pass expanded background checks. https://t.co/qWk4hMRarH
If a person can‚Äôt pass a background check, they shouldn‚Äôt be able to buy a gun. It should be that simple. RT if you agree!
It's past time to get something done to reduce gun violence across this country. Let's do that by passing universal background checks.
This is just commonsense, this is about reducing gun violence, this is about protecting our families.
The right to own a gun must also be weighed equally to the right of Americans not to be killed by someone who has no business owning one.
This is not about banning or taking away guns. I believe Americans have the right to own guns. My husband and I are proud gun owners.
I don't speak for myself. I speak for the majority of Nevadans who voted to pass Q1 ballot initiative on background checks for gun sales.
I support background checks that help keep weapons used to kill out of the hands of the severely mentally ill, criminals &amp; terrorists.
I've been an advocate for commonsense gun safety measures since my time as NV's AG. I know law enforcement supports reducing gun violence.
HAPPENING at 2pm ET/11am PT --&gt; Joining @ChrisMurphyCT to intro the Background Check Expansion Act. Watch LIVE: https://t.co/E7WhGHVmTn
We must work to reduce gun violence. The vast majority of Americans support background checks. Congress is the only place this is an issue
Nearly 30 million Americans still don't have health insurance. We need a #StatePublicOption to #UnlockMedicaid and close the gap.
@SenBrianSchatz Over 300,000 Nevadans gained access to care through #Medicaid expansion. #StatePublicOption would give NV the choice to buy into Medicaid.
#Medicaid expansion has been hugely successful in NV. We must build on this success. Proud to join @SenBrianSchatz #StatePublicOption bill. https://t.co/MbEpiT29I5
It's time to keep the door wide open. It's time Congress immediately take up &amp; pass the DREAM Act to #ProtectDreamers. #HereToStay
We will not hurt our economy by losing $433 billion over the next ten years, just so Trump can fulfill a campaign promise. #ProtectDreamers
DREAMers are our future doctors, lawyers, engineers, business owners, soldiers, &amp; leaders. We will not send 800k kids back into the shadows.
If these young men &amp; women - who are active members of our workforce - are deported, NV's economy would lose $585 million every year.
Businesses across U.S. from Silicon Valley to Wall Street to ranchers &amp; cattlemen in rural NV know this is bad economics. #ProtectDreamers
Trump rescinding #DACA doesn't fix our broken system. It bullies vulnerable, hardworking immigrants &amp; their families. #ProtectDreamers
I've met some of the 13k DREAMers in NV and they're incredible. People ask me: "what would you tell DREAMers?" I tell them they belong here
I'm here today because my grandfather had the courage to come to this country from Mexico. We should not be shutting the door behind us.
94% of DACA recipients pursued higher education thanks to the program. The #DreamAct would continue to provide that access. #ProtectDreamers https://t.co/My4wSWkPyD

Big companies are trying to use fine print to silence Nevadans. We must protect consumers, students, &amp; our servicemembers' access to justice
We can't let these big companies off the hook! The @CFPB's rule gives Main Street a fighting chance against the Big Banks &amp; seek justice.
Since @Equifax breach of 143 million Americans' info, I've received nearly 4 dozen letters from Nevadans seeking justice.
With at least 54,000 @WellsFargo fake accounts created in Nevada, it's more important than ever that consumers have protections from @CFPB.
When we let Nevadans have their day in court, it puts another cop on the beat to ensure Big Banks can‚Äôt gouge borrowers w/ tricks &amp; traps.
Whether it's fake accounts from @WellsFargo or @Equifax data breach, consumers need access to justice system &amp; have their day in court.
The @CFPB issued a simple, straightforward rule that safeguards the right of every single American consumer to hold Big Banks accountable.
In its short life, the @CFPB has returned $12 billion to 29 million consumers. In NV, the CFPB has worked to resolve about 14,600 cases.
As NV's AG, I took on the Big Banks that preyed upon NV families, bringing back $1.9 billion to NV. Now, @CFPB looks out for consumers.
Fraud shouldn't be kept secret like in @WellsFargo scandal - American people need @CFPB rule so companies don't take advantage of consumers.
