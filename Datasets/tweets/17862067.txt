@willwilkinson @AOC @CoryBooker ... it's not as if she's expressing some novel ignorance about nuclear power. And when WSJ attacks her as ignorant, I suspect that they're telling me that her ideas that do have expert support (maybe tax the rich more, as we used to) can be dismissed.
@willwilkinson @AOC For instance, I'm with @CoryBooker that nuclear power needs to be part of the mix fighting climate change, and believe that @aoc disagrees. And I gather that expert views on climate solutions are on the pro-nuclear power side. But ...
@willwilkinson @AOC Like @willwilkinson I have my areas of disagreement with @aoc		But even where I disagree with her, the notion that she's an unusually ignorant Rep who should just be dismissed is silly
@willwilkinson @AOC Recognizing that climate change is real and serious makes her less ignorant about the laws of nature than many Reps.		Sharp questions on Oversight about Trump's finances make her more effective in the eternal struggle for freedom than many Reps.

@karenstreet @asteris ... The critiques of Kamala Harris's record as prosecutor, right now, is coming from the left, and I think it's worth remembering that everyone, including Bernie, has gotten a critique from the left ...

@asteris I put together a list of such, and am planning to research them.
@asteris But the other question this raises for me is what self-described progressive DAs actually look like, in the US, when you look at their full records....
@asteris And her record as a Senator has been relatively progressive. Comparing her Attorney General record with other CA Attorney Generals, I don't think she looks as good as she did relative to other DAs ...
@asteris ... as our DA office has had serious problems (would make a whole thread in itself). And the reforming candidate I hoped would win this last election (Duc Nguyen) did not.
@asteris Her SF DA record is, IMO, above average for an SF DA, and considerably better than the DAs we have had in my time here in Orange County, CA ...
@asteris I'd say that the headline overstates the case (Kamala Harris was not a right wing prosecutor relative to US prosecutors in general), but the content is specific about her mixed record.
@asteris Exactly the kind of discussion we need, on all the candidates. They all have critiques from the left (some more than others) ...

But I'm not on board with asking people not to say negative things about any of the Democrats running for POTUS for over a year. I myself see some serious flaws in, for example, Tulsi Gabbard.
... I definitely want to hear the good things about the candidates you do like, in fact I'd rather hear more of those than bad things about candidates you don't like.
That's what primaries are for. I may listen to your criticism and disagree. I may agree and still vote for the candidate, because in the end everyone will have flaws and I will have to vote for someone. And ...
But if you have substantive criticism of Cory's record as mayor of Newark, as @jelani9 does, or substantive criticism of Kamala's record as Attorney General, as some do, or criticism of Elizabeth Warren's policies, etc, now is the time to air it.
And I don't want to hear stupid stuff like slut shaming Kamala Harris for dating Willie Brown more than 20 years ago.
I don't want to hear that Democrats are going to lose, lose, lose if they go too far left, because McGovern, or too centrist, because Hillary (win people for policies on their merits, not by trash talking).
I don't want to hear about how you are going to sit out the election and let Trump win if everyone doesn't vote for you favorite candidate or two.
Personally, I like most of what I have heard so far about Cory Booker, and he is on my short list. And there are some kinds of criticisms of Democrats that I don't want to hear from fellow Democrats.
There are some kinds of criticisms of Democrats that I'm not doing or listening to, but, whatever you think about @jelani9 's criticisms of Cory Booker, he's right that the primary is the time to raise them. https://t.co/pkdZKH16XK

@UOJim One where someone tried to fix the Treaty of Versailles (and maybe succeeded or maybe got a worse one). One where someone saved the Archduke to prevent WWI. One where someone went further back to stop the Franco-Prussian war. Etc.
@UOJim Since many people want to stop Hitler, there is a timeline for every way of trying to stop him. One where Baby Hitler died. One where Baby Hitler's parents never met....
@UOJim As a result, every time someone goes back to stop Hitler, the timeline with Hitler stays, but so does the timeline that either got fixed or failed to get fixed.
