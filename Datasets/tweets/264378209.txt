Haley statement: With its votes today, the #UNSC majority showed it was willing to blame #Israel, but unwilling to blame #Hamas, for violence in #Gaza. Further proof was not needed, but it is now completely clear that the UN is hopelessly biased against Israel.
So the takeaway from today's two failed #UNSC resolutions: No action to protect #Palestinian or #Israeli civilians; threat of escalating conflict remains.
#US alone in favor of its draft resolution blaming #Hamas for surge in #Gaza violence. #Bolivia, #Kuwait, #Russia vote against; 11 abstentions.
#US uses veto to block #Kuwaiti draft #UNSC resolution on protections for #Palestinians. #Netherlands, #Ethiopia, #UK &amp; #Poland abstained.
