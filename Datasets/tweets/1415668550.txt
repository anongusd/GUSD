Obama:  If you make it hard for them to win an election if they block those laws they will change course I promise you. #2A
Obama: The reason congress blocks laws is because they want to win elections. #2A
Tweeting President Obama's speech on his gun control Executive Actions he is going to put in affect. #2A
Obama: All of us need to demand congress brave enough to stand up to the gun lobbies lies.
Obama: Our right to peaceful assembly that right was robbed from movie goers in Aurora and LaFayette
Obama: ... and that right was denied Jews in Kansas City, and that was denied Muslims in Chapel Hill and Seeks in Oak Creek.
Obama: Our right to worship freely and safely. That right was denied to Christians in Charleston, SC...
Obama: ...that now kills almost as many Americans as car accidents.
Obama: I hope that more retailers and more manufacturers join them because they should care as much as anybody about a product...
Obama: If a child can't open a bottle of aspirin. We should make sure they can't pull a trigger on a gun.
Obama: ...if we can do it for your iPad there's no reason we can't do it with a stolen gun.
Obama: If there's an app that can help us find a missing tablet, which happens to me often the older I get,...
Obama: If we can set it up so you can't unlock your phone unless you got the right fingerprint, why can't we do the same thing for our guns.
Obama: We need to develop new technologies that make guns safer.
Obama: In the most technologically most advanced country on earth there's no reason for this.
Obama: In 2013 alone more than 500 people lost their lives to gun accidents and that includes 30 children younger than 5 years old.
Obama: ...are the result of legal guns that were stolen or misused or discharged accidentally.
Obama: 4. We are going boost gun safety technology. Today many gun injures and deaths...
Obama: "...here's your chance to support these efforts put your money where you mouth is."
Obama: "For those in congress so often rush to blame mental illness for mass shootings as away of a avoiding action on guns...
Obama: And remove barriers that prevent states from reporting relevant information.
Obama: That is why we are going to insure mental health records are submitted through the background check system.
Obama: That's why we made sure the Affordable Care Act aka Obamacare...treatment for mental health was the same as for any other illness.
Obama: A lot of our work is to prevent people from hurting themselves.
Obama: Nearly two of three gun deaths are from suicides.
Obama: 3. Do more for those suffering from mental illness the help that they need.
Obama: Working with advocates to protect victims of domestic abuse from gun violence.
Obama: Requiring firearms dealers to report more or lost stolen guns on a timely basis.
Obama: 2. We are going to everything we can to insure the smart and effective enforcement of gun safety laws that are already on the books.
Obama: We are going to bring an outdated background system into the 21st century.
Obama: Expanding background checks to cover criminals who buy some of the most dangerous firearms by hiding behind trust and corporations
Obama: Anybody in the business of selling firearms must get a license and conduct background checks or be subject to criminal prosecutions.
Obama: The gun lobby might be holding congress hostage, but they can't hold AMERICA hostage.
Obama: This is not a slippery slope to confiscate guns.
Obama: "We know we can't stop ever act of evil in the world, but couldn't we try."
Obama: "How did this become such a partisan issue?"
Obama: "Some gun sellers are operating under a different set of rules."
Obama: "I believe in the second amendment. It's there written on paper."
Obama: We are today not to prevent the last mass shooting but to prevent the next one.
Obama: Every single year, more than 30,000 Americans have their lives cut short by gun violence.
Obama recognizes Gabby Giffords in the crowd to applause from crowded East Room.
Obama: 5 years ago this week, a setting member Congress and others shot in AZ. Mentions Newtown, Charleston, San Bernardino and others.
Obama now stepping to the podium in the East Room.
Upcoming: President Obama to make a statement on his executive actions to curb gun violence at 11:40 a.m. ET.
