@Dj_MadArab @DineshDSouza @doanfilm I am not saying they are not endangered or can't be extinguished. I'm saying, like life itself, their origin is divine. Even those who defined our own rights never claimed, as Spencer does, that they're creations of man. Only progressives believe that.		Trump is fixing the rest.
@Dj_MadArab @DineshDSouza @doanfilm They may be easily oppressed, which becomes even easier when we say they come from man, who may or may not protect them, not God. 		Truth: Our rights are "endowed by our creator," not man or government, and these rights are forever "unalienable." All true conservatives know this.
@Dj_MadArab @DineshDSouza @doanfilm Spencer says rights are not natural and that they come from government, not God.

@_waleedshahid @MattGrossmann @DaveAHopkins @daschloz Constructive suggestions. Winner take all likely discourages turnout in solidly red and blue districts.

@PHXGTR @POTUS The surgeon and knife murderer both use knives, but to wholly different ends. POTUS uses tariffs to eliminate tariffs. His opponents have no plan to eliminate them and have used "free trade" rhetoric mostly to justify inaction.

Nikolas Cruz pulled that trigger in Parkland, not the @NRA. His evil was facilitated by an FBI that ignored warnings, a school that was insufficiently secured, and a Broward Co. Sheriff's office that mismanaged its response.		Whatever lessons can be drawn start from these facts.
The AR-15, contrary to progressive rhetoric, is not an "assault rifle." Also seldom mentioned, it is America's most commonly-owned legal weapon.		Never mentioned: The AR-15 has routinely saved lives, such as in this #lllinois case:		https://t.co/36jYyBlhfH		#MarchForOurLives #2A

Encouraging to see young Americans vocalizing their concerns in today's #MarchForOurLives .		I hope they realize no American in policy leadership wants gun violence. Sadly, though, no criminal intent on killing others is easily deterred by another law. Guns have saved lives too.
Let's stop saying @POTUS is "starting a trade war" with #China. 		We've been in a trade war for decades. The casualties have been the loss of whole American industries, millions of U.S. jobs, and a $375 billion annual U.S. trade deficit with them.		#Trump comes to end this war.
It's reasonable to "understand." But "applaud"? No one seeking to #DrainTheSwamp can applaud this swamp debacle.		More appropriate is condemning @SpeakerRyan and @SenateMajLdr for putting @POTUS in this dilemma, which you have failed to do.		#Arizona needs @kelliwardaz.		#AZSEN https://t.co/MewnBkbf0z
I suspect @RepMcSally will tell the voters of #Arizona she'll be a change agent in the U.S. Senate.		Really?		Change agents don't vote for budgets that fund #PlannedParenthood and fail to fund the wall (as she just did).		@kelliwardaz would've voted no; she's #AZ's best choice.
It sure would've been inspiring if @POTUS threw the 2K-page #ominibus on the Oval Office floor and demanded #Congress return and fix it.		But the #veto would've been the easy part. Winning in a shutdown would've been a huge challenge, and why we must be united and collaborative.
.@PeteHegseth raised a good point this morning:		A growing number of public school classrooms do not have United States flags even though the pledge is recited in all states (optional for students in some, mandatory in others).		Check your child's classrooms. Insist on the #flag.
@SmithToddM @POTUS I have lost confidence that Senate Dems will preserve the cloture rule if they ever won the Senate. Repealing it, in my view, would likely be one of their first acts.This is not the Dem party of the 90s; they are far-left and permit little dissent.
As @POTUS said today, the time's come to repeal the #Senate's 60-vote cloture rule. With the current cloture rule, the Senate has become the place great ideas go to die.		Next step? We need our current Senate Majority Leader to embrace this reform. If not, we need a new Leader.

Good news on omnibus: We have right man in Oval Office. This budget restores America's military might as @POTUS promised. China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea should take note.		But every '18 candidate should be asked: Should bills be read before votes? Will you fund the wall?

We don't hear much in recent years about the line item veto, which we conservatives championed in the #Reagan years. 	.	But it remains important. With it, @POTUS could remove funding for #PlannedParenthood in the omnibus. Without it, his only option is vetoing the entire bill.

We spend tens of millions annually (both overtly and covertly) impacting and altering the political climates of foreign nations. 		We've even toppled governments--often justifiably and to the world's betterment.		But we shouldn't be shocked these acts are reciprocated; they are.
Russia's been engaged (unsuccessfully) in trying to impact our elections since at least '60; nothing new there.		But never before has a campaign (Clinton) paid a foreign intelligence agent to assemble a dossier of lies used to obtain surveillance warrants on a competing campaign.
Today's indictments explicitly reiterate what I have said from day one: 		Russia had zero impact--none--on the U.S. election. 		The tactics themselves also seem relatively unserious, more suitable for a student government than U.S. presidential campaign.		And no collusion.
Biggest takeaway in today's Mueller indictments may be overlooked:		We need vastly improved methodologies and greater restrictions on the issuance of U.S. visas. Clearly this handful of Russians had no constructive basis for being here in the first place. 		Why were they?

"I ask that the Congress declare that since the unprovoked and dastardly attack by Japan on Sunday, December 7th, 1941, a state of war has existed between the United States and the Japanese empire."		-#FDR's 12/8/41 address to Congress on #PearlHarbor 		#PearlHarborRemembranceDay
National #TeaParty objective: 		We need to destruct swamp's partisan divide, which is precluding Congress from putting #AmericaFirst and fueling destructive criminalization of political discord.		Tyrannies since beginning of time have sewn division as means of autocratic control.
#FISA warrants against Trump campaign and advisors were likely obtained fraudulently and illegally by Obama and Clinton for purposes of political surveillance.		These warrants should now be released into the public domain; they'd reveal the lack of any justifiable probable cause.

The days of America "leading from behind" are thankfully behind us.		The days of America leading are again at hand.

#TaxReform does not represent, as @NancyPelosi is propagandizing, "armageddon."		Economic armageddon would be invited by not cutting taxes, thus constraining #GDP and adding to 95M Americans not in labor force.		Growth creates jobs, reducing deficit. Stagnation leads to opposite.
To #DrainTheSwamp, both parties need to stop lying to Americans about #publicdebt (now being used to oppose much-needed #TaxCuts ).		Our debt is represented in T-bonds, which (along with reserve accounts) equal total dollars in circulation. No inherent threat. 		We need tax cuts.
Yes, our fed gov is doing too many things (and poorly) that are not its charge under U.S. #Constitution. 		But we do not face a public #debt crisis (dollar is strong, #inflation minimal). We face a growth and job creation crisis (net out immigrant jobs and no new jobs since '00).
The genius and greatness of @POTUS's '16 campaign was realigning the #GOP with the challenges of working Americans and the #poor.		But the GOP's Congressional leadership is undermining this. All mid-income Americans need tax telief, and #Medicaid remains vital for the poor.
