Over the next several weeks, keep an eye out for this series and these people's stories.
One man said he was willing to risk army conscription upon returning: “At a minimum I’ll be in my own country. If I serve and survive, I’ll be able to start a real life.”
In conversations outside embassies and even in a cafe restroom as @DSoguel helped a Syrian mother change her baby’s diaper, she listened to their struggles.
@DSoguel spoke to Syrians in Berlin and Athens who are deeply uncertain about their future in Europe. “What struck me was their extreme yearning for the homeland,” she says.
And then there are the migrants themselves.
@peterfordcsm has talked to people smugglers in Niger – “we have to eat,” says one – and to EU officials trying to hit the problem at its source. “Africa is just 14 kilometers from our coast,” the EU ambassador in Niger notes. “Africa’s security and development is ours, too.”
@ryanlenorabrown will look at Tanzania’s bold resettlement experiment.
Our new series, “On the move: the faces, places, and politics of migration,” will share a variety of perspectives in pivotal places across the Americas, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia.
How should nations address the issue of global migration?
But migration's role in sparking conflict is also well known, and today, a record level of global migration is rattling agendas, upending elections, and spurring pointed exchanges between poor countries and rich countries. https://t.co/pLrGYNPhAZ
@AmeliaNewcomb: It’s a familiar point: that migration has been central to the human experience, helping to spread new ideas across millennia.

At close range, drought does even more than leave people hungry or far from home. by @ryanlenorabrown https://t.co/VIvCuJEy2S
Ethiopia's Addis Ababa sits in stark contrast to rural areas that have struggled against severe droughts in recent years. But innovative aid has helped farming communities manage the crisis. https://t.co/13zNPnaLfO
Where persistent drought is the new normal, communities will have to adapt – a challenge across eastern Africa. But Madagascar’s success, and the lessons that it learned from its brush with disaster, point to how crises might be averted elsewhere. https://t.co/YV7uUYWr0R

Our reporters traveled to Madagascar, Ethiopia, and Somaliland to investigate the daunting challenges as well as the long-term efforts that are saving lives.
But over the past two decades, nations that once produced searing images of famine's toll have moved to thwart it by strengthening community resilience.
On #WorldFoodDay, we want to share our 2017 series on famine resilience. Last year, more than 20 million people from Yemen to Tanzania were at risk of starvation in what aid workers called the largest humanitarian crisis since World War II. https://t.co/PSpEZwqfKr
