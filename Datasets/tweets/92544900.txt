Fear among US intell &amp; law enforcement is that the seeds for the next global terrorism crisis will be sown if countries refuse to deal with this problem. Right now the only plan seems to be: have the SDF hold on these people for as long as possible. Insanity.
Some lawmakers are suggesting restocking Gitmo. Pres Trump has raised an important Q: why should the US shoulder burden of nationals of other countries who joined ISIS? Some countries‚Äô terrorism laws aren‚Äôt equipped to bring these people to justice. US changed its laws post 9/11
Story also is a reminder that countries like Canada have been dragging their feet on dealing with the Q about what to do with their citizens who joined ISIS. Hundreds are detained by US-allied militia and others in Syria and Iraq. Some countries are refusing to take them back.

It was clear to everyone in Flynn sentencing courtroom that Judge Sullivan likely was preparing to lock Flynn up. Flynn lawyers decided to take the delay until March, hoping to get a better deal then.
Judge Sullivan takes a shot at the David Petraeus sentence for misdemeanor after sharing classified info with unauthorized person.  Judge says he doesn‚Äôt agree w light treatment of Petraeus. Kelner had raised Petraeus for comparison to Flynn case.
Flynn atty Kelner says Flynn asking to delay sentencing 90 days. The judge had repeatedly offered to delay.
Judge Sullivan appears to have seen some coverage during court recess, so he wants to clarify: he isn‚Äôt accusing Flynn of treason; and clarifies that Flynn‚Äôs work for Turkey ended before he became national security adviser. The judge has clarified himself.
Recess over. Flynn Atty Rob Kelner tells judge Flynn shouldn‚Äôt be punished for a filing his lawyers made.
Judge Sullivan now prodding prosecutor Van Grack whether Flynn defense memo takes away from the credit he gets for taking responsibility.
This process usually is shorter when both prosecution and defense recommend no jail time. Flynn quietly says ‚Äúyes your honor,‚Äù as Judge Sullivan rails about ‚Äúvery serious offense‚Äù he has pleaded guilty to.
Judge Sullivan tells Flynn that serving as unregistered agent of a foreign country while serving as National Security Adviser means ‚Äúarguably you sold your country out.‚Äù  Judge says he can‚Äôt hide his ‚Äúmy disgust, my disdain.‚Äù  Flynn and lawyers seemed stunned.
RT @pkcapitol: It's not your father's Blue Dogs anymore: Founded as a refuge for mostly white southern Democratic men, post-1994, Blue Dogs‚Ä¶
Judge Sullivan is going thru defense filing, says it raised concerns about whether Flynn still wanted to plead guilty.  Flynn lawyer Rob Kelner says they aren‚Äôt contesting false statements guilty plea as a result of any misconduct by FBI.
Flynn, flanked by his Covington &amp; Burling lawyers, says he still wants to take responsibility for false statements. Flynn says he still wants to plead guilty.
Flynn tells judge he doesn‚Äôt want to challenge circumstance of FBI interview. He says he was aware that lying to FBI was a crime.
Judge Sullivan notes Lt Gen Flynn accepted responsibility but that defense memo focused largely on circumstances of Jan 2017 FBI interview. Judge says Flynn suggests he was unguarded in FBI interview because he wasn‚Äôt warned about lying.
