DEAR NANCY PELOSI &amp; CHUCK SCHUMER,		AS AN AMERICAN CITIZEN, I AM DEMANDING THAT YOU FINALLY PUT ME ABOVE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AND BUILD THE WALL!		I AM STANDING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP TO SECURE OUR BORDER AND DEMANDING THAT YOU DO THE SAME FOR THE SAKE OF OUR COUNTRY.		SINCERELY,	ME
FACT #7	The abuse of our weak asylum laws has rapidly increased the backlog of our immigration courts. In fiscal year 2018, these courts had a backlog of more than 786,000 pending cases
FACT #6	America‚Äôs weak asylum laws allow illegal immigrants with baseless claims to come and stay in the United States while awaiting legal proceedings. Since 2010, these claims have increased by 1,700%.
FACT #5	Nancy Pelosi and her hyper-liberal Congressional colleagues just passed a bill to give $54 BILLION to foreign governments, but Democrats won‚Äôt allow just $5 billion to secure our borders and protect American citizens.
FACT #4	The Democrats would rather risk the safety of working Americans than work with President to secure our nation‚Äôs borders. But in 2013, all 54 Senate Democrats, including Schumer, voted to pass legislation that provided $46 billion to build a physical barrier on the border.
FACT #3	In 2018, over 17,000 adults arrested at the border had prior criminal records. This included over 6,000 gang members, a major number of those members were from MS-13.
FACT #2	In fiscal year 2018, U.S. Border Patrol seized or helped seize 282,000 pounds of cocaine, 248,000 pounds of methamphetamine, 6,500 pounds of heroin, and 2,400 pounds of fentanyl.
FACT #1	In four Customs and Border Protection sectors where physical barriers have been expanded -- El Paso, Yuma, Tucson, and San Diego -- illegal traffic has dropped by at least 90%.
