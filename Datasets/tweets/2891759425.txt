Now, 2006-vintage normy Democrats are called lame because we still want to enact a public option, cap-and-trade, carbon tax, non-emitting energy, transit infrastructure, ENDA, Gang of Eight-style immigration reform, legal weed. I feel like such an old. https://t.co/yrFePfynNv

Back in college, we were campaigning for Ned Lamont vs. Joe Lieberman in the Connecticut Senate primary. We won the primary - but lost the general. It was a good fight!		https://t.co/n2uaXICrtA

By 2004, it was refreshing to hear Howard Dean run unapologetically from the  "democratic wing of the Democratic Party" on the Iraq War, global warming, LGBT rights. He was inching towards marijuana decrim, crim justice reform. 		https://t.co/2I1wOzGr4o
In the early 2000s, esp. post 9/11, Democrats were scared into thinking the only way to win elections was to tack fairly to the center on balanced budgets, deficit reduction, welfare, and crime - and left on health care, global warming. guns, women's rights, LGBT rights.
DLC centrism popularized by Bill Clinton, Tom Daschle, Joe Lieberman, Evan Bayh, etc. is of course long pass√©, as any other 30-year-old ideology. In 1992, it was the only way to win elections in Reagan Country states that went red 3x in a row.
I want to take back the term "progressive". According to my definition, progressive Democrats are defined by liberalism on gun safety, LGBT rights, immigration reform, criminal justice, global warming. Al Gore, Howard Dean, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, Barack Obama were all 4/5&gt;.

@fuelgrannie @CarolynBMaloney @RepGregoryMeeks @RepJeffries @RepMaxRose On one hand, 25,000 high paying jobs, 10,000 union construction and maintenance jobs, $20 billion+ tax revenue/20 years to pay for the subway, on the other hand, a bowl of faux-woke word salad with red rose dressing.
@fuelgrannie @CarolynBMaloney @RepGregoryMeeks @RepJeffries @RepMaxRose Sure, a small minority of New Yorkers hold your (ideological, inaccurate, and irrelevant) objections. But in a democracy, governments are supposed to further policies supported by the majority of citizens, that provide the greatest good for the greatest number of people.
@nicolegelinas If, in the alternative, we had 200 economic development projects in the pipeline that would generate $5 million tax revenue/year, or the NY legislature had raised $1b/y in  income taxes, property taxes, a pied-a-terre tax, marijuana tax, etc., fine. But I'm not holding my breath.
@nicolegelinas Part of the reason I'm so vehemently pro-Amazon is it's the only practical means of funding the Byford Plan and financing the reconstruction of NYC subways. Congestion pricing only get's us half the way there. We're still short ~$1b/y.
... and here, some of the most vociferous NIMBYs who opposed the economic development project can't even claim that it would be in their backyard! Imagine if the Park Slope Food Co-op sued to block construction of the new Google building in the West Village...
During this whole Amazon HQ2 saga one of the things that bothered me the most is how the state + city economic development agencies conscientiously worked on a plan directly next to the best subway lines, LIRR, GCS - it's a STATEWIDE project - and narrow-minded NIMBYs rued day. https://t.co/qjTmRPtAQ9
Sure, neighborhood NIMBYs + DSA goofballs packed Jimmy Van Bramer, Mike Gianaris, AOC's offices and said #NoAmazonNYC. But more people in New York elected city councilmen, state legislators, a mayor, and a governor to develop the economy, create jobs, raise $ to fix the subways.
@ajcarrillo Show me the contract. As the late great philosopher once said, "It ain't over 'til it's over."
If Amazon builds HQ2 in LIC, many of employees would live in Queens. Multiple thousands would live in Maloney's NY12, AOC's NY14, Grace Meng's NY6, Gregory Meeks' NY5, Nydia Velazquez's NY7, Hakeem Jeffries' NY8 - in EVERY borough, every neighborhood, every district in NYC. https://t.co/nXUSYvUy8r
More members of the New York Congressional delegation are for Amazon HQ2 than against it. @CarolynBMaloney, @RepGregoryMeeks, @RepJeffries, @RepMaxRose, the most relevant unions, NYCHA tenants, civic groups, are urging Amazon to go ahead with HQ2. 	https://t.co/5EceJgtfi1
Who cares what @AOC thinks about Amazon? The proposed HQ2 site wouldn't even be in her district. Long Island City is in New York's 12th Congressional District - represented by @CarolynBMaloney. Maloney is for it, and so are the majority of New Yorkers and Queens residents. https://t.co/x1eGQPFUQJ
I'm a fervent liberal on immigration reform. But I disagree with @AOC on undocumented immigrants/gun sales. If an undocumented immigrant tries to buy a Glock - which is prohibited by law - yes, law enforcement should be notified! This is not a hill for Democrats to die on.

It's wrong to think that ^ LIRR service only benefits Long Island residents. You'd be surprised how many Queens residents take LIRR to Manhattan - and how many Manhattanites reverse commute to Nassau and Suffolk, etc.
Though, truth be told, if LIRR improves so much with current MTA projects that the number of commuters driving from Long Island drops even 5% or 10%, that would ease congestion on NYC streets SIGNIFICANTLY - and make NYC bus service noticeably better.
The injustice isn't that New York spends too much money on public trandit for Long Island (it's still not enough!). The injustice is that we are shortchanging NYC subway and bus commuters.
(Also, the #LongIslandSix Democrats are the essential swing voters in the NY State Senate. Public transit advocates can hardly get anything done in Albany without them. We gotta pander to LIRR commuters the same way national Democrats pander to corn farmers in Iowa and Wisconsin.
If you talk to anyone who commutes to the City from Nassau or Suffolk, the constant refrain is how horrible their commute is. The massively expensive LIRR 3rd Track Expansion and East Side Access projects are absolutely necessary to make their commutes more bearable.
HERESY: the % of MTA funds allocated to LIRR vs. NYC subways is grossly unfair. But we need to throw gobs of money at Long Island commuters, to the point of pampering them, to encourage them to ride LIRR - or else they'll drive to Manhattan, which is worse.

@SquarePegDem @trimmerfund @AOC @MikeBloomberg OK, I stand corrected re: property taxes. I hadn't known that was the arrangement. But there still must be some taxable asset at the Ferry Point golf course...
@SquarePegDem @AOC @MikeBloomberg AOC was alleging that the Trump Org intentionally deflated the value of certain assets, including the Trump Golf Links, to evade property taxes. That could be tax fraud. 		Believe me, usually I think AOCnomics is loopy nonsense, but she might be on to something here...

@NYUWagner @nicolegelinas @RichardBrodsky But in the end, I think @nicolegelinas won this debate. #congestionpricing is absolutely necessary to fix NYC's streets and subways. It's not a perfect policy (no policy is). But it's th4 only logical choice.
I applaud @NYUWagner for putting on such a good debate. @nicolegelinas and @RichardBrodsky were such intriguing debaters because they defied ideological stereotypes. This isn't such a simple question of Urbanites v. Suburbanites, or Straphangers v. Drivers.
Both Gelinas and Brodsky are correct to attribute lion's share of increased congestion to Uber and Lyft drivers which circulate around Midtown empty, waiting for passengers - and applaud the $2.50 tax on for hire vehicles.
Gelinas makes a better point that congestion is partially worse due to the soaring population of mentally ill and homeless living on the subways. It scares and offends a lot of New Yorkers, causing them to drive or take Uber and Lyft home at night.
Gelinas is making a point that part of congestion is also caused, in part, by 40% of New Yorkers receiving packages delivered by Amazon. This is true, sort of, around 10 AM - 3 PM. (But given current events, this feels kinda like pandering to the audience)
If we were talking about income taxation, Brodsky would be correct. A Flat Tax on income would be horribly unfair. But #congestionpricing is not the same as income taxation. It would be impossible to assess different tolls for each commuter based on income.
Brodsky is sort of correct. #congestionpricing would be a flat tax of $12 - paid equally by a CEO and a custodian, without regard for their ability to pay. But that doesn't mean that it's not progressive taxation - or even regressive taxation.
Still, Brodsky argues that #congestionpricing is another example of regressive taxation, favored by wealthy white environmentalists, which will raise the tax burden of working class black and Hispanic New Yorkers. (I think this is faux-woke word salad)
Gelinas retorts that the "fairness" argument against #congestionpricing is a straw man. Almost all working class New Yorkers who commute to Manhattan for low wage jobs take the subway or bus. CP will improve it. VERY few low wage earners drive to work in Downtown Manhattan.
Brodsky is arguing that #congestionpricing is unfair because it is not a progressive tax - an investment banker at Goldman Sachs can easily pay $12/trip to Downtown Manhattan, but it is a major burden to a plumber or a nurse who has to drive from Queens to Manhattan.
Gelinas is making the case that #congestionpricing will 1. raise about $800m &gt; $1.2b/y in revenue for the  MTA, to improve train service 2. discourage marginal drivers to take public transit
The speakers at this debate seem to be topsy turvy. @nicolegelinas, a writer at the very conservative Manhattan Institute and NY Post, is for #congestionpricing. @RichardBrodsky, the longtime liberal Democrat New York Assemblyman, is against it.
So many New Yorkers excited for #congestionpricing the hall is packed like Broadway at Rush Hour! @nicolegelinas @RichardBrodsky https://t.co/gFC2Tu64GS

If we want to build a new generation of commuter railroads, subways, streetcars, and high-speed rail,  ^carbon tax, ^gas tax to encourage people to ditch their cars for public transit, Democrats need to include @UAW in the next booming industrial job market.  #GreenNewDeal

@petertinti @voxdotcom OK, now I have. My criticism stands. I am doubtful of the value of activists putting so much stock in a non-binding resolution, written like a Fox News parody of liberal Democratic climate policy.
@abgutman @amyep9 There are also very different degrees of poverty. A person making $15/hr, with an income of $25,000 - is in a very different position than a person who lives exclusively on public assistance. Different circumstances require different policy solutions.
@abgutman @amyep9 I think it's difficult to argue that a person who already pays $0 in federal income taxes is excessively taxed. There are other policy mechanisms to increase their income - say, doubling SNAP benefits - that could be more effective than ^ their tax refund.
@abgutman @amyep9 I think it's the matter of what is and what is not taxable income. If a person's income is derived exclusively from TANF, SNAP, and federal housing vouchers, those are all categorically not subject to taxation - that person pays $0 federal income taxes.
@amyep9 @abgutman Terminology aside, EITC is really one of the best things in the Internal Revenue Code. Democrats like Sherrod Brown are proposing major expansions of EITC, I think that's a winning platform in 2020. 		https://t.co/oBQwid8Ptg
@amyep9 @abgutman I see where you're going, but if the term "Earned Income Tax Credit" is problematic that's new to me. It's one of the few provisions in the tax code that rewards low wage earners - instead of passive income from stocks or inheritance (impliedly, "unearned income").
@petertinti @voxdotcom ... which is why they should put their energy into actual binding legislation that would reduce CO2 and methane emissions - rather than a non-binding resolution.
@abgutman I don't think the two are comparable. EITC was enacted as a way to reward low paying wage earners. Clinton's effective doubling of the EITC also intended to help people escape the Poverty Trap where Medicaid + AFDC rules did actively discourage people finding part time jobs.
I'm still gunning for @JoeBiden because I don't think any other candidate can make the case for national investments in public transit infrastructure, a high speed rail network between Chicago to Milwaukee to Minneapolis, to St. Louis, to Detroit... 		https://t.co/hCbJgaULmP

Where the authors of the #GreenNewDeal erred is that the New Deal was a generation-long commitment of the U.S. Government to invest in the U.S. economy, primarily infrastructure that would generate jobs in construction and manufacturing - to save capitalism.
I would like to see leadership from the President is to run on a national High Speed Rail network, commuter rail, streetcars, buses in every U.S. city.

... So I don't think Dems are ever going to get Joe Manchin to sign onto cap-and-trade (or any Senator from WV, for that matter). But why not let Manchin, Tester, Portman, Toomey, come together with legislation that would lop significant %'s off U.S.'s carbon footprint?
I might be the one liberal environmentalist sympathetic to Joe Manchin. Despite being from a coal state, he and Rob Portman have sponsored legislation which would significantly ^ energy efficiency from gov buildings, factories, and household appliances. 		https://t.co/9bQ2FmEMxM
But say it's 2021. Dems have a 51-to-49 majority in the Senate, They wouldn't have the votes for Waxman-Markey per se. The swing votes would be some combination of Joe Manchin, Doug Jones, Jon Tester, and maybe a few R's: Lindsey Graham, Pat Toomey, Rob Portman, etc.
Waxman-Markey also included a smorgasbord of other climate-friendly laws, including a 20% renewable energy mandate for all utilities, energy efficiency standards for buildings and appliances, and subsidies for low-income Americans' utility bills (which would rise).
Waxman-Markey was delicious legislation. It would have created a cap-and-trade system for carbon pollution, cutting CO2 permits each year for a 17% cut by 2020, 83% cut by 2050. (Obviously those #s would change).
To me, the most ambitious climate legislation would be something like the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 (Waxman-Markey), which passed the House 219-212 - but never came up for a vote in the Senate. 		https://t.co/8BkqwYB3CS
What policies the next Democratic White House can do on climate change, however, will be determined largely by the outcomes of 2020 Senate races in Colorado, Arizona, Montana, Maine, Iowa, Georgia, North Carolina, Alabama. Dems need to net +4 if they want a bare majority of 51.
Depending on the status of the #CleanPowerplan in 2021, most likely we will see the Biden/Warren/Harris EPA and DOJ enforcing the carbon emissions rules on Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Georgia, Florida, Tennessee, Missouri, etc., suing them into compliance. https://t.co/5cfqKMkRZc
Since Scott Pruitt "revoked" the #CleanPowerPlan in 2017, a coalition of blue states: New York, California, Oregon, Massachusetts, Illinois, Michigan, Virginia, etc. have kept their CPP state implementation plans in place, as though nothing has ever changed.
The next thing a Biden/Warren/Harris administration would do is have the EPA reinstate the carbon emissions rules under the #CleanPowerPlan. This may require revisiting APA rulemaking. (I would argue that the Trump rule is invalid, the 2014 carbon rule is still on the books)
It is quite obvious that the first or second thing the next Democratic President would do would be to re-enter the Paris Climate Agreement. That goes without saying. The diplomatic aspect of preventing catastrophic climate change cannot be underscored enough.
Unpopular opinion: we do need a #GreenNewDeal, but it should be all about policies that reduce carbon and methane pollution and massive trillion-dollar investments in low-carbon energy, industrial, and transit systems - lopping off the loopy, laughably bad Socialist parts.

@jaymart222 I've heard many anecdotal stories of landlords doing stupid "capital improvements" that don't improve tenants' housing but justify increased rents: e.g., installing a chandelier in the foyer. But the @SenGianaris bill wouldn't stop that. It would thwart necessary improvements.
@jaymart222 Once again, @SenGianaris' demagogic legislation is terribly ill-advised. Overwhelming vast majority of major capital improvements are necessary: fixing broken stairwells, elevators, boilers, etc. Landlords need to be able to pay for them.

All I know for sure is that I'm not voting for @nomikikonst for #NYCPublicAdvocate. Konst is an absolute moron, literally incapable of answering a question without regurgitating BernieBro talking points.
... but I also really like @JumaaneWilliams. He seems like someone who would be really good at conducting oversight of NYCHA, MTA, and other troubled city agencies. This guy is going places. (He also could be Mayor someday)
Also, if you think of the Public Advocate primarily as being second in line of succession to the Mayor, I would be very content with @MMViverito in charge of New York City (esp. if @BilldeBlasio runs for higher office, leaving a city of 8.6 million with an absentee Mayor).
I'm leaning towards @MMViverito because I really admire the work she did on the City Council conducting oversight on NYPD and DOC. I think that as Public Advocate she would root out bad actors and force significant change in the way NYC administers criminal justice.
I'm genuinely on the fence about the #NYCPublicAdvocate election. I'm leaning towards @MMViverito, but I also really like @JumaaneWilliams. Both have been fine public servants in the New York City Council.

@Kick_Frenzy No. This is simply false. Sanders did not campaign for Doug Jones, Conor Lamb, Max Rose, Abigail Spanberger, et al. I don't think he campaigned for a single Representative or Senator who flipped a seat red to blue.
Conversely, some stalwart liberal icons like Elena Kagan, Stephen Breyer, and Merrick Garland (remember him?) have a much more expansive view of the state's inherent police powers - even when the statute might be vague.

@iamJxWoods @magi_jay @reesetheone1 Do you think the guy who as Senator enacted the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act of 2002 and the Voting Rights Act of 2006 was in favor of SCOTUS cases where the Roberts Court struck down key parts of the laws he wrote? Really?
@iamJxWoods @magi_jay @reesetheone1 You're literally listing the biggest Supreme Court decisions that Vice President Biden disagreed with the most vocally 2009&gt;2016, because they struck down statutes he had enacted as Senator.
@Fieldandfen @magi_jay @reesetheone1 To the contrary, it is indeed quite possible to defend Joe Biden, Ted Kennedy, and the Senate Judiciary Democrats' campaign to defeat the Thomas confirmation. I'm doing it right now. Rem ipse dixit.
@Fieldandfen @reesetheone1 What, specifically, did Biden say in 1991 that you think was an objectionable line of questioning, or otherwise counterproductive to the objective of defeating Thomas' confirmation? I'm genuinely interested to know.
@Fieldandfen @magi_jay @reesetheone1 And again, Biden did not exhibit "appalling behavior". Clarence Thomas' behavior to Dr. Hill was appalling. Senate Republicans' questioning of Dr. Hill was appalling. 		Biden was literally fighting them! (albeit, not hard enough)
@Fieldandfen @magi_jay @reesetheone1 Au contraire.

@magi_jay I do recognize these criticisms. I've read them all. This was one of the most important chapters in the modern history of SCOTUS. 		But it is false to conclude that Joe Biden is responsible for Clarence Thomas' confirmation to the Supreme Court. Literally the opposite is true.
@magi_jay What else is the purpose of the 2020 primary rather than to analyze the candidates, their successes, their mistakes + why they made them, to assess their character, and try to apply them to realities they may face 2020&gt;2028?

@magi_jay @reesetheone1 Here's the exact quote: 		https://t.co/x0aoDdMg4F https://t.co/DDNN21FAKB
@magi_jay @reesetheone1 I think his exact words were something like "I owe her an apology" for what happened with Hatch, Simpson, Specter, etc. But I think you're putting more than a few words in his mouth. And I absolutely don't think Biden could have gotten Shelby, Nunn, Breaux, Boren, to vote no.
@magi_jay @reesetheone1 Even if Biden had done all of these things, in an alternative history, I don't think it would have swayed Richard Shelby, Sam Nunn, John Breaux, J. Bennett Johnston, Dan Boren, et al. These were _extremely_ conservative Southern Democrats.
@magi_jay @reesetheone1 Have to agree to disagree. My main takeaway from Biden's questioning in the Thomas hearings was here's a guy who was incredibly sympathetic to Dr. Hill, who thought that Judge Thomas had wronged her, and employed what he thought was the best strategy to block him from SCOTUS.
@GMSarli @reesetheone1 I'm very doubtful of this. The Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee isn't a judge. I think you attribute far more power to the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee than exists IRL, by parliamentary procedure or Senate tradition.
@magi_jay @reesetheone1 1. The Chairman of the Judiciary Committee can't prevent other committee members from questioning a testifying witness. 	2. This wasn't a trial. There was no precedent for such a scenario.	3. I would have probably done the same. They would have diminished Hill's testimony.
Excellent thread on bail reform policies at Philadelphia DA: https://t.co/wsZDzZ94SI
@GMSarli @reesetheone1 Sure. I just watched them a few weeks ago. It's clear as day that Biden believed Dr. Hill and so he was asking questions to incriminate Judge Thomas. 		I think you're wrongfully misattributing Orrin Hatch, Alan Simpson, Arlen Specter's hostile questioning to Biden.
@reesetheone1 I'm going to have to respectfully disagree. If an attorney has two witnesses to testify to a fact, one very credible and one very not credible, he'd have to be a fool to call the second to testify. It adds nothing, and diminishes the credibility of the first.
@reesetheone1 I think we're going to have to agree to disagree on the legacy of the Thomas confirmation hearings and Biden's role. I think the HBO movie took much artistic license in portraying Biden as a semi-villain, hostile to Anita Hill.
@reesetheone1 The additional witnesses were significantly less credible than Dr. Anita Hill. Do you think that Dianne Feinstein should have called Julia Swetnick to testify against Brett Kavanaugh?
@reesetheone1 To hold Biden responsible for Thomas' kooky jurisprudence would be like blaming Dianne Feinstein for Brett Kavanaugh's future bad decisions. Biden did everything he could to block Thomas' ascension to SCOTUS! (including not calling weaker character witnesses to testify)
@reesetheone1 But in all fairness, Biden put up a concerted effort to defeat Thomas' nomination, and he rounded up almost every Democrat in the Senate to vote nay. He almost succeeded too - the roll call vote was 52 to 48. 		https://t.co/7Ph5EtGlEz

From here until the 2020 Democratic Convention, I am going to make an editorial decision to largely ignore Bernie Sanders. He's by far the stalest candidate in the race, has nothing new to offer, and the Democratic Party is never going to nominate a non-member for President.

The most logical place for John Hickenlooper and Steve Bullock in the next Democratic administration would be Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Agriculture, or EPA Administrator. Very important jobs, but consolation prizes vs. United States Senator.
In comparison, I have a hard time imagining a scenario in which Hickenlooper or Bullock somehow pulls ahead of Biden, Warren, Harris, Booker, Brown, Klobuchar, and Gillibrand. The field is already supersaturated.
I'm so bullish about @hickforco running for Senator of Colorado, @GovernorBullock running for Senator of Montana because both have just won election and re-election in their respective states.  They would be the most formidable candidates to oust GOP Senators.
John Hickenlooper needs to run for Senate in Colorado for the same reason @GovernorBullock needs to run for Senate in Montana, @BetoORourke needs to run for Senate in Texas @staceyabrams needs to run for Senate in Georgia. POTUS isn't the only 2020 race. The Senate matters a lot.

@adum23 So long as the NYC economy and population are expanding, it's going to hurt incumbents (small businesses, renters) located in the most desireable locations next to MetroNorth, LIRR, subway stations.
@adum23 EVERY time you build new residential or commercial construction ANYWHERE in the city, it ^ property values nearby. There's no way to stop that. Economics 101. The only solutions are ^ subsidies for low income, middle income housing or saturating the market.
@adum23 Well, at this point I'm crying over spilled milk. But let's be honest, the Queens Waterfront is still THE most logical place for commercial construction. Right next to LIRR, 7, E, F, G Trains. (Many would commute from Long Island)
@adum23 I don't see any way to expand NYC business and housing, to improve public services, but to densify BK, QU, BX, SI, expand the urban core. Single family homes in Park Slope, Astoria, Forest Hills, etc. are going to be replaced by apartments. It's not a matter of if but when.

But one thing is for sure, whatever progress may or may not ever happen on a resurrected Oslo peace process, the @BDSmovement is not helping to bring the parties to the table. It is only serving to divide and distract Democrats, help Republicans win elections.
The great fear is what happens if Ismail Haniyeh wins the next Palestinian elections. A Hamas government would be an unmitigated disaster. Haniyeh would rather wage a third Intifada than agree to Barak's 2000 or Olmert's 2008 offer. 		https://t.co/9FUFEWqLMo
As for the Palestinians, I dunno. Mahmoud Abbas is significantly more willing to comprise than Arafat ever was. The great what-if is whether a center-left coalition offered to Abbas a plan substantively similar to what Barak offered Arafat at Camp David in 2000, would he say yes?
^ This is truly a liberal Zionist fantasy, but not beyond the realm of possibility. Such would create the most pragmatic Israeli government, committed to the peace process since Ehud Olmert circa 2008, or Ehud Barak circa 2000 pre-Intifada 2.0.
Best case scenario: Netanyahu is indicted on corruption charges, his coalition in the Knesset collapses. Next election, Likud loses bigly. Yair Lapid, Tzipi Livni, Avi Gabbay, Moshe Kahlon cobble together some sort of Labor-Yesh Atid-Hatnuah-Kulanu coalition.
Netanyahu clearly has no interest in a two-state solution. His Likud&gt;far right coalition is predicated on continued settlement expansion in the West Bank. But Bibi's 61/120 Knesset majority is tenuous. Next election cycle, Likud could lose seats, Kulanu could defect to opposition
Any historian of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will tell you that he next Democratic White House will not be able to make a two-state solution happen unless there are two parties willing and able to negotiate in good faith. Doubtful so long as Netanyahu and Abbas in office.

@NYCSpeakerCoJo @bradhoylman To boot, I'll add that the pied-√†-terre tax is even better than De Blasio's proposed "millionaire's tax". Massive income tax hikes in New York will lead to many moving to New Jersey, Connecticut, Florida, or elsewhere. Pied-√†-terre taxpayers already don't live here.

So if the economic calculus wasn't good enough, the political calculus is even better. The only people who would pay the pied-√†-terre tax practically by definition do not vote in New York elections. They vote in Miami, London, Moscow, or Hong Kong.

I have an advanced degree in tax law from NYU, and I think that @bradhoylman's proposed  pied-√†-terre tax is perhaps the optimal tax.

Fair, the analogy isn't 1:1. Venezuela isn't a U.S. client state - they're a strategic rival. So imagine Saddam Hussein were still the President of Iraq in 2011 during the Arab Spring. Obama would have probably called for Hussein to step down, like Biden is to Maduro right now.
A much more apt analogy on would be to the Obama administration's policy on incumbent dictatorships during the Arab Spring. If you remember, when the Egyptian people were out in Tahrir Square demanding electoral democracy, the Obama State Dept urged Mubarak to relinquish power.
Twitter leftists like @RoKhanna @TulsiGabbard @IlhanMN are entirely wrong to compare U.S. policy re: the Maduro regime in Venezuela to Cold War-era subversion like in Guatemala, Chile, or the Dominican Republic. Clearly this isn't the same thing.

I challenge @SenGianaris @JimmyVanBramer to come up with their alternative plan to come up with $40 billion/20 years to pay for the Byford Plan and fix the subways without +$1 billion/y in Amazon tax revenues, without massive tax hikes on NY'ers. They don't have one.
I really wish that @SenGianaris @JimmyVanBramer listened more to the concerns of New Yorkers who want more high-paying jobs in Queens, who want +$1b/year in tax revenues to pay for upgrades to the subway. @32BJSEIU represents working class NY'ers on this issue. @nycDSA does not.

@adum23 @edfischman I think people are buying the "he started it" defense.
@adum23 @edfischman Acknowledging all of your above concerns, I don't think there is any such fear of a "Coronation". There are multiple, major Democratic candidates who have a significant chance of securing the nomination. This field ain't Martin O'Malley, Jim Webb, and Lincoln Chafee.
@adum23 @edfischman People are worried that this presages a 2016 redux. Is Bernie going claim his losses the result of "rigged primaries"? Are his supporters going to boo and hiss at 2020 Convention speakers? Will he refuse to lend his email listserv to the DNC? Will his supporters stay home in Nov?
@adum23 @edfischman Quite frankly, the reason people are 100x angrier about this than Bernie's rebuttal this year is the fact that he's giving a rebuttal to Trump and Stacey Abrams and not Trump and Joe Kennedy III.
@adum23 @edfischman And for the record, I'm annoyed that it has started an arms race and other 2020 contenders are doing it too. I'm annoyed that Kamala Harris is undermining Stacey Abrams' rebuttal too.
@adum23 @edfischman This muddies the waters. If Stacey Abrams criticizes Trump's steel tariffs - and then Bernie praises them, or Stacey Abrams rips NAFTA 2.0 - and then Bernie praises it - then it undercuts the Democratic Party's response (and diminishes Stacey Abrams).

But I don't see how @CoryBooker would be a drag on the ticket in the general election. He is not seen as particularly left-wing or ideological. He could win Pennsylvania, Michigan for sure.  Wisconsin, Ohio, Iowa, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona would be tough bouts.
Looking at the electoral map, I have a hard time seeing @CoryBooker's path to the nomination. I'm unsure how he comes out ahead of Biden, Harris, Warren.
The only bad rap I can honestly give Booker is that he has a reputation as a show horse. He loves the camera's eye, and he'd always prefer a TV interview over a boring committee hearing. But isn't that true of 100 out of 100 Senators?
Don't even try with this "b-b-b-but Cory Booker is a neoliberal" hogwash. Cory Booker is awesome. When marijuana is legalized on the federal level one day, either he is going to write the bill or sign his name on it  		https://t.co/tIaYxlWK9j
Booker serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He has the national security credentials to run for President - more than Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, or Donald Trump. 		https://t.co/s3kYpBd5vp
He has also passed significant environmental legislation - and in a Republican majority Congress to boot. Booker is good at this.		https://t.co/mrsaCwUEvH
@CoryBooker In the Senate, @corybooker has been a very effective legislator. He's good at coalition building and forging compromises across thr aisle. 		https://t.co/wOmVYDZmom
In hindsight, @CoryBooker did a remarkable job as Mayor of Newark. He reformed municipal government and hustled to get Prudential, Goldman, Panasonic to invest in a broke city. For the first time in 60 years, the population of Newark is growing, anchor stores are opening downtown
If you remember, back in 2002, @CoryBooker was the starry-eyed idealist running against the (truly corrupt) incumbent Sharpe James to shake up Newark city government. In many ways, he succeeded.
I'm unapologetically enthusiastic about @CoryBooker's campaign for President. I've been following his career since his first run for Mayor of Newark in 2002, and I like what I see. https://t.co/Ee6HmselX3

Hate to break it to #KamalaisaCop Twitter, but in California, parents have responsibilities. Failure to provide food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and education to a child in your custody is a crime. These are cases of gross neglect where CPS can take custody of a child. https://t.co/aYH49vbbYJ
Lastly after all these are exhausted then the Attendance Board has the chance to send it to the DA. By the time it gets to this level, a year has passed. We're not talking about parents whose kids played hooky one day - but parents who have flouted California ed law for a year.
Here are the steps to the process. First come the daily phone calls then letters, visits from counselors, then social workers, if the parents keep ghosting after all these steps then the parents are referred to the School Attendance Review Board.
#KamalaIsaCop people are inaccurately portraying San Francisco DA's policy. We're talking about extreme examples of child abuse. Parents who are intentionally or negligently depriving their child of a primary school education for more than a year (or worse).

For Cinematography, I would have to lop off A Star is Born. Finding creative angles to obscure the fact that Bradley Cooper is not playing guitar does not deserve an Oscar. Give it to Beno√Æt Delhomme's luscious work in At Eternity's Gate.
For Best Original Screenplay, lop off Vice. Adam McKay was deserving for The Big Short, but this wasn't his best work. Boots Riley's script in Sorry to Bother You was inspired.
For Best Adapted Screenplay, lop off A Star is Born. It was melodramatic garbage. Replace it with The Death of Stalin by Armando Iannucci.
For Best Supporting Actor, I would lop off Sam Rockwell and Sam Elliott. This was not their best work. Not at all. Replace them with John C. Reilly as Oliver Hardy and Simon Russell Beal in Death of Stalin.
For Best Actress, I would lop off Lady Gaga. She can sing but sure as hell can't act. I would replace her with Elsie Fisher from Eighth Grade or Kiki Layne from If Beale Street Could Talk.
For Best Director, I would lop off Adam McKay. Screenplay maybe, but Director is unmerited. That nom belongs to Damien Chazelle for First Man or Barry Jenkins for If Beale Street Could Talk.
For Best Actor, I would lop off Bradley Cooper - who didn't even learn to play guitar, not even the simple licks of "Pretty Woman", for his role. That nomination belongs to Ryan Gosling for First Man.
Don't get me wrong, I loved Black Panther. It deserves Oscars for Best Score, Song, Production Design, Costume Design, Sound, Makeup, etc. 		But was it really better than If Beale Street Could Talk and First Man?
I understand that the Academy is trying to democratize things by giving more critical recognition to popular fare, but this is just ridiculous. Bohemian Rhapsody, Vice, A Star is Born, and Black Panther do not all deserve Best Picture nominations.
A Star is Born was not a good movie. Bradley Cooper didn't even play guitar. It deserves "Best Song" and no more.

What in God's name does @briebriejoy that President Sanders and President Tulsi Gabbard would do instead with federal law enforcement? Not take care that the laws are faithfully executed? Just ignore the entire U.S. Code but for the titles on Antitrust and Banks?
And most importantly, if she is elected President, @KamalaHarris will get to choose what the federal judiciary looks like for the next 40 years. She would most likely end up nominating replacements for Supreme Court Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, and Thomas.
If she is elected President, @KamalaHarris can make an enormous difference on how the U.S. Government approaches criminal justice, to enforce the laws more fairly and equitably. From the White House down, she would have an enormous bully pulpit to reform U.S. laws.
If she is President, @KamalaHarris, through her appointments, will set the agenda for federal law enforcement. She will decide what kind of cases to pursue, what issues to focus on, how to interpret statutes, change law enforcement methods.
If she is elected, President Harris would appoint the Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General, Ass. Directors for Criminal, Civil, Civil Rights, National Security, Natural Resources and Environmental, and Tax Divisions!
If she is elected, President Harris would appoint the director of the FBI, Secretary of Homeland Security, Treasury, SEC, EPA, etc. - each of which hires federal agents to enforce the law! They will investigate, search, and arrest people!
I know @briebriejoy went to Harvard Law, but this article reads as though she needs to brush up on Article II, namely the clause that states that the President "shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed". POTUS nominates the law enforcement officers in the exec branch!

To this day, @SecNielsen seems woefully disinterested in the roughly 44,000 individuals detained in DHS custody. We're not talking about 44,000 "bad hombres", we're talking about refugees, 13,000+ kids. She doesn't care if they have heat or lice. She doesn't fucking care.
More so than perhaps any other individual in the Trump administration, @SecNielsen is directly responsible for the health and safety of every single person in @DHSgov custody. Nielsen is ultimately culpable for negligence, cruelty, and human suffering.
Forget about Individual-1 for a moment. @HouseDemocrats should investigate Secretary of Homeland Security Kirjsten Nielsen @SecNielsen for misconduct and impeachment re: family separation policies, failure to provide adequate medical care to detainees in DHS custody, perjury.

Voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Ohio, Florida had an opportunity to vote for the first female President, a Senator from New York on the Armed Services Committee, already in 2016. I'm not sure what Gillibrand offers that Clinton did not.
But who is the target demographic for @SenGillibrand? Voters who want a female President - but not one as lefty on business regulations as Warren? Voters who want a female President - but not one as socially conscious as Harris? Who's left but women in Big Law?
Gillibrand also gets major credit for the STOCK Act - which prohibits Congress members from trading stocks based on nonpublic information. This legislation was all hers.
@SenGillibrand Her signature issue is gender equity in the Armed Forces; specifically ending DADT, opening up front line combat positions to women, and the Military Justice Improvement Act - which would remove sexual assault cases from the chain of command.
Tbh, I think @SenGillibrand has done a fine job in the Senate - but I don't see her path to the nomination, let alone the White House.

The only thing positive to say about @tulsigabbard's entrance into the race is that hopefully she splits the Alt Left vote with Bernie - leaving him in 6th or 7th place in Iowa.
If @TulsiGabbard is considered a "progressive" not despite but distinctly because of her isolationism, pro-Moscow tilt on foreign policy, crude anti-capitalism, xenophobia and illiberalism - that about explains my apprehension about current definitions of "progressivism".
Without a doubt, Tulsi Gabbard is my least favorite candidate, even lower than Bernie and Bloomberg. She's a demagogue and a conspiracy theorist. Some of Gabbard's views on foreign policy are horrendous.

@RoKhanna This sounds like a horrible way to legislate, no offense.
@petertinti @StephenBeban Where I will disagree here is we're not talking about a temporary deficit. We're talking about more than doubling the U.S. social welfare state - which AOC, etc. are implying could be financed by permanent multitrillion deficits. That's a recipe for a Zimbabwe-style meltdown.
@petertinti @StephenBeban If it's 2009, and we're arguing for massive Keynesian spending, and temporary massive budget deficits, I'm totally with you - concerns about deficits are but crocodile tears.
... which is why I find it so surprising that they're choosing "pay-as-you-go" budgeting rules as their first fight against the House Dem leadership in 2019. They're admitting that the numbers in their bill can't possibly add up!
Medicare For All requires an adult conversation about taxation which Berners apparently aren't willing to have. By pretending away this $3.2 trillion/year revenue issue, claiming it could be paid for by just "The 1%" or the Pentagon, @AOC @RoKhanna are being plainly dishonest.
Mind you, I'm not arguing that you can't ever pass universal health care under the Medicare system. It's just that we have to raise income taxes and payroll taxes high enough - on everyone. Otherwise it would cause a 1975-style fiscal meltdown.
The fact that @AOC @RoKhanna are arguing against pay-as-you-go budgeting rules because it hinders #MedicareForAll is an implicit self-own that their bill is woefully inadequate to raise $3.2 trillion/year in revenue, would cause  multitrillion annual deficits.
@petertinti ... reducing the deficit and improving America's fiscal health is extremely progressive - so long as it is done by restoring the 2016-vintage Internal Revenue Code (what Dems want to do) - and not by slashing domestic discretionary spending (what GOP wants to do).
@petertinti I think it comes down to a debate on how we define "progressive". I think undoing the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which busted the budget like none before, is quite progressive. Had #PayGo been in place in 2017, Paul Ryan wouldn't have been able to pass his tax law.
@petertinti This is how this debate played out in 2004. John Kerry was talking about reinstating #PayGo because it would mean no further budget-busting tax cuts for the 1%. George W. Bush, of course, was against #PayGo because he didn't mind racking up trillions in debt to finance tax cuts https://t.co/qRQebbILJ9
@petertinti Budget legislation has to be approved by the House, the Senate, and the WH. For the budget to be enacted as law, it would have to be financed by #PayGo. There's no such thing as a House-only stand-alone budget.
@petertinti Because it prevents the Trump admin from adding to the $1 trillion/y deficit. The chances of enacting Medicare for All, or any major social welfare legislation, in 2019-2020 are zero degrees Kelvin. The Progressive Caucus is being delusional by pretending otherwise.

3. @SenWarren's legislation that could improve fairness for consumers student loans is also really good. It doesn't abolish student loans (let's be realistic now), but it makes it significantly less likely for borrowers to default. 		https://t.co/ri9zFBl313
2. @SenWarren's proposal to revamp the U.S. Post Office into a place where the unbanked can cash checks, conduct basic consumer transactions is a real gem. This is the kind of bite-size, tangible progressivism that I love. 		https://t.co/OGlO0gL65a
1. The centerpiece of @SenWarren's legislation is the Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act.  If anything, Progressivism is a political philosophy based on ethics in government. 		https://t.co/K9Akrjz9qv
The thing I like best about @SenWarren is that she is a one-woman progressive policy workshop. The bills that she has introduced since being elected in 2012 together form a bold middle class economics platform.(Thread!)
It's going to be hilarious watching @OurRevolution @TheYoungTurks try to tear down Elizabeth Warren as a "neoliberal centrist". It will be their downfall, like Joseph McCarthy's hunt for Communists in the U.S. Army.
@petertinti holy fuck
With @KamalaHarris, many of the biggest states in the South are electorally competitive again. Democrats will perform at Obama Coalition levels across Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida - maybe even in Texas, South Carolina.
You realize if @KamalaHarris puts her campaign HQ in Atlanta, and she's on the ticket, Georgia and its 16 electoral votes are 100% up for grabs. 		https://t.co/nDEg2ohEu8
@dancluchey Their time as a think tank for Democratic policy was at most 1985 &gt; 2004. Now they only exist as a good source when calling BS on really bad legislation from the Progressive Caucus e.g. crunching the numbers to show why a single payer bill doesn't add up.
@FrangibleRocker @668GuerrillaMan I'm always down for a substantive discussion of Democratic policy and legislation. Here's to a collegial, kind, and spirited discussion in 2019-2020!
@FrangibleRocker Mind you, I'm saying this as someone who loves Hillary.  I've voted for her 3x. In college I interned for her on Capitol Hill. 		But Biden has been more liberal on global warming, renewable energy, public transit, LGBT rights. Facts are facts.
@BeninBiloxi @FrangibleRocker https://t.co/bSkaOOrRnS
@BeninBiloxi @FrangibleRocker Biden endorsed same sex marriage in 2012, famously forcing Obama's hand. Clinton didn't make a similar statement until 2013. I love Hillary, but she was more tepid than Joe on this one. 		https://t.co/o9KE7AOO2L
@FrangibleRocker So, on a lot of matters, Biden's 2020 platform would be identical to Clinton's in 2016. But he's often far less cautious, more forward-thinking, more willing to stake out a liberal position well before it's polling at 55%-60%.
@FrangibleRocker 4. Hillary was a latecomer on a lot of LGBT issues (e.g. endorsing same sex marriage long after it was controversial). Biden has been much more forward-thinking on these issues; e.g., as VP he made a point of elevating trans rights as a Democratic policy. https://t.co/WGBK0V4Hg1
@FrangibleRocker 3. Biden really took ownership of mass transit and high speed rail, more so than any other Democrat. Hillary pushed for fed funds for NY infrastructure 2000-2008, of course. But Biden has done this for almost half a century. https://t.co/rIPmBpRMoX
@FrangibleRocker 2(a). I dare you to prove me wrong on environmental / energy policy. If there's a single major environmental issue that Biden didn't bring up years before Hillary did, or vote more conservative than Hilllary, I'd be truly shocked. 		https://t.co/okoQBAmY9D
@FrangibleRocker 2. Any objective history of U.S. energy policy has to credit Biden alongside Gaylord Nelson, George McGovern, Patrick Leahy as a champion of wind and solar energy. He's been pushing for more development of renewables since the 1970s. https://t.co/okoQBAmY9D
@FrangibleRocker 1. Joe Biden introduced the first ever federal legislation on global warming in 1986 - when Hillary was still the First Lady of Arkansas. He had been working on this issue literally decades before Hillary.		https://t.co/FtLG1PHDvC
@monsoon2112 Believe me, I think I know then-Senator Clinton's domestic policies quite thoroughly. I spent a whole summer writing her constituent correspondence on every single piece of legislation from 2001-2006. She was less liberal than Biden on some things.
@Scattered211 Please, prove me wrong. Here's Joe Biden's voting record on every major environmental and energy legislation from 1973 through 2008. If you can find a major issue here on which he was more conservative than HRC at that time, I'd be truly shocked. 		https://t.co/okoQBAmY9D
@Scattered211 Mind you, I'm saying this as someone who loves Hillary.  I've voted for her 3x. In college I interned for her on Capitol Hill. She campaigned as a liberal on many issues I care about. 		But Biden is more liberal on global warming, renewable energy, public transit, LGBT rights.
@Scattered211 So, on a lot of matters, Biden's 2020 platform would be identical to Clinton's in 2016. But he's often far less cautious, more forward-thinking, more willing to stake out a liberal position well before it's polling at 55%-60%.

I'm not so sure "Green New Deal" is the best way to market it though. It sounds more like the new plant-based combo at Panera Bread, a progressive word salad, than an actual substantive federal infrastructure policy.
According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, the U.S. needs to increase spending on infrastructure by roughly $2 trillion to even bring it to adequate levels. This should be the centerpiece of the Democratic platform. 		https://t.co/cerexoKGAT
Sure, the Recovery Act was insufficient. The $831 billion economic stimulus package was composed primarily of $288 b in tax cuts and $144 b in aid to states to prevent across-the-board public sector layoffs. Relatively little, only $154 b, went to infrastructure, energy, etc.

@RepLeeZeldin With all due respect, noted white supremacist @SteveKingIA is your colleague and you two vote together quite often on immigration legislation.
There are also some oddly overlooked acts that need to be inducted one of these days: T. Rex, Willie Nelson, The Delfonics, New York Dolls, Minor Threat, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Mot√∂rhead come most immediately to mind.
So long as they're trying to induct more hip hop acts, I'd recommend @rockhall move on from LL Cool J. He just wasn't that good. DJ Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaataa, Eric B. &amp; Rakim, Boogie Down Productions, A Tribe Called Quest, The Fugees, Nas, Notorious B.I.G. all eligible.
For future years, I'd like the @rockhall to take a cue form this year and focus more on the 80s and 90s. Beck, Phish, Smashing Pumpkins, Nine Inch Nails, Sonic Youth, Soundgarden, Jane's Addiction,  Bjork, PJ Harvey are all eligible.
@minister65 Of those who didn't make the cut, I think Kraftwerk, Todd Rundgren, Chaka Khan are most deserving of a second look. (admittedly, Kraftwerk is the most deserving - but the hardest sell)
@minister65 @AGoodAche @toddrundgren Also, note that Sonic Youth, Pixies, Nirvana, Soundgarden, etc. were really responding in protest to Def Leppard's sound.
@minister65 @AGoodAche @toddrundgren Def Leppard gave rise to the whole subgenre of hair metal: Guns N' Roses, M√∂tley Cr√ºe, Ratt, Twisted Sister, etc. In more modern times, The Darkness and The Struts are direct descendants of Def Leppard's sound.

I also like the fact that, but for Stevie Nicks and The Zombies, @rockhall seems to have progressed to the semi-modern era, no longer just a list of 50s doo wop groups and 70s classic rock acts.
@rockhall did a very good job of recognizing a wide swath of genres, from Janet's pop and Def Leppard's hair metal to The Cure's goth rock and Roxy Music's art rock.

fwiw, I think Amazon should recognize its Staten Island warehouse workers efforts to unionize. Building Amazon HQ2 in Long Island City and unionizing the warehouse workers in Staten Island aren't mutually exclusive.
@NYCSpeakerCoJo Over the course of 20 years, Amazon would generate about $1 billion/year in tax revenues each year which could be used to fund subways, schools, public housing, homeless shelters, etc. I think that $1 billion/year should go first to the subways.
@notcapnamerica Which poll is this? @notcapnamerica
@JimmyVanBramer @realDonaldTrump With all due respect, of all the very real concerns about HQ2 (e.g. ^ traffic), this is by far the loopiest, tinfoil hat anti-Amazon argument. It discredits your more real, tangible concerns.

Kendra Horne, the newly elected Democrat who won a surprise victory from Oklahoma's 5th Congressional District, outraised her opponent $1,189,551 to $684,257. What do you think her constituents in Oklahoma City, Edmond, Shawnee and Bethany do for a living?
I'm reluctant to demonize Democratic candidates who have accepted (perfectly legal) donations from people who work in the oil, gas, coal industries All the 30 year olds in Houston, Dallas, San Antonio with disposable income to donate to Beto O'Rourke, what do you think they do?
But we also need as many people as possible to contribute the legal maximum according to U.S. campaign finance law. An individual can give no more than a $2,700 to a single candidate during an election cycle (primary + general), a total of $5,400.
We need to raise money from as many people as possible. Even if individual donors are contributing only $20 or $50 at a time, Democrats need to cultivate as wide of a donor base as possible. It's necessary to keep voters engaged throughout the year, not just on Election Day.
If we want to keep our majority in the House and claim a majority in the Senate so that a Democratic President could actually pass substantial legislation, Democrats need to raise another $800 million.
Democrats have to assiduously adhere to campaign finance laws. Democrats should go above and beyond and raise the bar for ethics and transparency. But let's not be daft; Democrats still need to raise at least $800 million to defeat Trump in 2020 - probably more.

@EStruening And honestly, if folks like Harold Baines are in, it makes the exclusion of much better players Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens, Gary Sheffield, Manny Ramirez, Sammy Sosa, Rafael Palmeiro even more suspect.

@EStruening I thought Baines was more like Larry Walker, Steve Garvey, Rusty Staub or Matt Williams. If there's a Mendoza Line for Cooperstown, I think they fall just under it.
@EStruening I'm more meh about Harold Baines. He was consistently pretty good - but never really a league leader at DH or that much of a star. Never hit more than 29 HR in one season. But he did end up with 2,866 hits, 384 HR, 1,628 RBI. You can make a good stats case for Baines. https://t.co/RKvkpvWJDL
@EStruening I'm more meh about Harold Baines. He was consistently good - but not great. Baines was a DH who never hit more than 29 home runs in a season. But he did finish with 2,866 hits, 390 HR. You can make a good stats case for him. https://t.co/diOijq1fKx
@EStruening If you don't induct Lee Smith, then you can't ever induct Billy Wagner or Francisco Rodriguez - who are borderline cases.
@EStruening So long as Bruce Sutter, Goose Gossage, Rollie Fingers are in the Hall of Fame, it's hard to argue against Lee Smith. And unlike, say, Eckersly, I don't think that Gossage or Fingers had particularly exceptional careers as stating pitchers.
@EStruening If you look at Lee Smith's stats, I think he makes a rock-solid case. The only reason he wasn't considered as much of a star is that after 8 seasons with the Cubs, he kept on being traded from team to team - as many as 3 different teams in the same season.
@EStruening We'll have to agree to disagree. I'm very content with Lee Smith in the Hall of Fame. He was the most prolific relief pitcher of the 1980s and 90s. 478 saves, now 3rd all time. 7-time All-Star. https://t.co/QNwW455pBh

Honestly, this looks like as much of a lost cause as the wars in Vietnam and Afghanistan. MTA / NYPD ought to declare victory and leave.
I want more police officers to enforce the law in the subway trains and stations - but for actual quality of life issues like people committing assault on the trains, not stupid bullshit like turnstile jumping.
The more I think about it, the dumber the law enforcement angle to this problem actually seems. Even if NYPD expanded its police force by 1,000 cops, 2 each at every subway station, to enforce the law vs. turnstile jumpers, it wouldn't make a dent in fare evasion.
MTA suffers because of a literal "free rider" problem with actual economic consequences. . But I'm doubtful NYPD issuing citations for 548,000 cases of "theft of services"/day would solve it. I don't think we can police our way out of this problem. https://t.co/Bfp3CsacOG

But Bush's legacy will forever be marred by his domestic failures. Bush was infamously aloof about the 1992 recession, indifferent to AIDS victims, callous to the human cost of the War on Drugs. He promised "Message: I Care", but no one believed him. He was too patrician.
I understand how one could see Bush as a superb foreign policy President. But now as we are dealing with a reactionary Russian adversary, an unstable Iraq, al-Qaeda, ISIS, a dying Rust Belt, it's clear that most of Bush's temporal successes came with definite long term costs.
The biggest problem with Bush's legacy was he lacked that "vision thing". As much as he chalked up enormous successes like the post-Cold War order, the Gulf War, NAFTA, he did not at all brace for the inevitable counterreactions - which in many ways eclipsed his successes.
So, comparing the pros v. the cons, I think historians will generally see Bush as one of the most skilled practitioners of diplomacy, and as Commanders in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States. I think he is most comparable to Polk or Truman.
10. Vomited on the Prime Minister of Japan.
9. I'm not sure to what degree one can fault Bush for not recalling the U.S. Ambassador after China's crackdown on demonstrators at Tianenmen Square. In retrospect, he could have made a stronger rebuke, but I think he was right to keep full diplomatic relations.
8. Bush was infamously slow to respond to genocide in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Compared to Clinton, Bush was incredibly deferential to Moscow and Yugoslavia's sphere of influence.
7. Once the Soviet Union fell, Bush pulled out of Afghanistan and left many of the mujahedeen whom the CIA had armed and trained out in the lurch, reneged on promises of economic aid and development. We know how that turned out...
6. Bush leaving 100,000s of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf nations was also in retrospect a major mistake. I mean it's not like the former CIA Director could have been expected to foresee how this could become a problem.
5. Bush sat on his hands and did absolutely nothing as Saddam Hussein butchered the Marsh Arabs, for fear of upsetting the post-Gulf War peace. Spineless.
4. In retrospect, Vice President Bush building up Iraq's military capabilities during the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s was a mistake.
3. As President, Vice President, U.N. Ambassador, his defense of the Apartheid regime in South Africa as our Cold War proxy in Africa was heinous. He had the opportunity to be a force for liberalization and instead he went along to get along.
2. Totally 100% complicit in the Iran/contra scandal. Pardoned Caspar Weinberger and CIA operatives who lied to Congress about the scandal. When all of this skullduggery gets declassified one day, historians will reflect on the depths of Poppy Bush's depravity.
1. Totally 100% complicit in the worst of the worst war crimes as Vices President in the Reagan administration. Totally responsible for everything awful that took place in Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, etc. from 1981 through 1988 (and after).
Now for the top 10-ish foreign policy cons of the Bush administration:
10. Bush generally staffed his State Department with respected realist professionals like James Baker, Lawrence Eagleburger, Brent Scowcroft, Thomas Reilly. He didn't hire Strangelovian ideologues like Reagan and Bush 2.0 did.
9. Bush admin organized the Madrid Peace Conference with Israel, the PLO and the Arab League, more or less set the table for the Oslo peace process and Clinton's more tangible successes to come later.
8. NAFTA was absolutely in the success column. But leaving it to the Clinton administration to ratify, giving Democrats responsibility for the economic dislocations after he left office was a dick move. Like farting in a full elevator and getting off on the 2nd floor.
7. I know my Chomskyite friends will disagree, but I think I'm going to chalk up Operation Just Cause as a military success. Deposed dictator Manuel Noriega. Upheld the results of the Panamanian elections.
6. Bush's decision to follow Colin Powell's advice, to stop at the Iraqi border and not drive on to Baghdad, averting (at least for 12 years) the occupation of Iraq. What neocons like Cheney, Rumsfeld thought was a tragic mistake was in retrospect prudent and sensible.
5. Bush assembled a coalition of 35 countries, including NATO allies Britain, France, Canada, former Warsaw Pact members Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Arab League nations Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, U.A.E., to wage Operation Desert Storm.
4. President Bush used his long-cultivated relations with Moscow and Beijing to have them support the U.N. Security Council Resolution 678, authorizing use of force to remove Iraqi military from Kwait. One of the best coups in U.S. diplomatic history.		https://t.co/tuHSAkQRyV
3. Bush's diplomacy with European allies, helping to shepherd the reunification of East Germany with West Germany as a democratic regime in the NATO alliance, was without any question superb.
2. Bush negotiated the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with Gorbachev, signing perhaps the single greatest document in arms control history. START reduced all strategic nuclear arms - as then existed - by 80%.
1.  George H.W. Bush Successfully maintained incredibly good relations with Moscow as Mikhail Gorbachev was dismantling the Soviet Union, ended the Cold War as we know it. This will go down as one of the finest moments in the history of the American presidency. Period.
So here's George H.W. Bush's foreign policy record, top 10-ish pros and cons. First the pros.
At the same time, I am not willing to engage in hagiography with Bush. He had some enormous accomplishments, but he also took part in some of the uglier parts of the 20th century. I think history will hold Bush in mixed regard.
First, over four decades in Washington, George H.W. Bush made a reputation as a generally kind and decent person. He got along with Democrats and Republicans alike, and set that tone for his administration. Nowadays, one realizes that isn't something we can take for granted.
With a quarter century in hindsight, George H.W. Bush's legacy deserves an honest analysis. I try my best to give an objective take on his pros and cons. https://t.co/mpvifMbm8W

The remaining GOP aye voters, Pat Toomey, Rob Portman, Steve Daines, Jerry Moran, Bill Cassidy - are anyone's guess. Every once in a while I suppose they might be able to step up to their roles as United States Senators.
In addition, @SenToddYoung signed onto the Sanders-Lee resolution - which is interesting, because he is one of the new leading Republican Senators on foreign policy. He's quite thoughtful and genuinely interested in foreign affairs, much like  Richard Lugar.
To me, the biggest accomplishments were getting the aye vote of Lindsey Graham (who is apparently mad that Gina Haspel wouldn't brief the Senate), Bob Corker - the outgoing Foreign Relations Committee Chairman, and Lamar Alexander - a sometimes surprising Senate institutionalist.
Mike Lee was able to muster much more than just his wily libertarian partner in crime Rand Paul, and occasional anti-Trumpers Jeff Flake, Susan Collins, and Lisa Murkowski, to vote aye.
Voting aye were all 47 Democrats, 2 Independents, plus 14 Republicans.

If people are worried that 25,000 Amazon employees concentrated in Long Island City and 7 Train Queens would lead to massive rise in rents, gentrification, displacement, the BQX would make it more tenable for them to live in Astoria, Greenpoint, Williamsburg, etc.
If anything, commercial development and high rise construction along the Queens riverfront is only going to increase. And but for the G Train there are really no good public transit options.

But at least with @BilldeBlasio's new policy to halt unnecessary marijuana arrests, there are now a lot fewer young men spending the night in jail, who will see their lives potentially ruined over a petty offense.
Even if there were full Colorado-style legalization (there will be one day), it will still be against the law to smoke a blunt in the train station - just as it is against the law to smoke a cigarette or a cigar in the train station. A violation punishable by fine.
Had this happened further down the D Train in Manhattan or Brooklyn, this guy would not be prosecuted according to @ManhattanDA @BrooklynDA's new policies. Sadly, however, @BronxDA Darcel Clark hasn't followed suite.
This new policy seems about right. This man won't have an arrest record. But he will have to miss a day of work to show up to court, this Summons for smoking a blunt in the Subway will be on his record.
The guy was given his Summons, NYPD said "You're  free to go." NYPD uncuffed him, just in time to hop on the next arriving D Train. The whole process took less than 5 minutes.
But now in 2018, the guy was apprehended, handcuffed while NYPD asked him for his name, address, etc. and wrote up a Summons. And NYPD lectured him "You know it's against the law to snoke weed in the Subway."
Had this been in the Giuliani or Bloomberg days, NYPD would have arrested the guy smoking a blunt, sent him to Central Booking, and he would have spent the night in jail before making a first appearance.
3 NYPD officers stumbled upon a guy - looked about 22, Latino, working class - smoking a blunt in the middle of the @FordhamRoadNYC subway station. Party foul dude!

RT @jaymart222: üëáüëáüëáüëáüëá thread on how tax breaks actually work https://t.co/eoIF1w19MB
There's a NIMBY argument against Amazon. Rents will rise in Long Island City. Traffic on I-278 will increase. LIRR, 7 Trains will be more crowded. But don't be dishonest and pretend your concern with the Amazon HQ is for New York's finances because that's just objectively wrong.
$5 billion in tax revenue would still be more than 15x the $325 million spent by the Empire State Development Corporation, and more than 3x the amount of the overall subsidy. (it would make up 1/8 of the $40 billion needed to fix the subways according to the Byford Plan)
Sure, I'm skeptical about the figure of $10 billion additional tax revenue over 20 years being bandied about. Say in actuality the tax revenues are half that. New York State would take in $5 billion in additional tax revenue.
Does it really matter if $1 in revenue comes from state corporate tax vs. state income tax?
New York State would take in hundreds of millions of dollars every year in in additional tax revenues from the employees' income taxes, property taxes on their homes, sales taxes on every purchase 25,000 employees make at the LIC Starbucks and Panera Bread, etc.
But by Amazon spending $2.5 billion on construction of an enormous new campus in Queens, employing maybe 5,000 temporary construction workers, and expanding the economy by 25,000 permanent employees - indefinitely - that expands the New York job market significantly.
That $325 million would come out of the $4 billion annual budget for economic development projects under the Empire State Development Corporation. The $1.2 billion represents tax revenue that never existed.
You realize that if New York State gives Amazon $1.525 billion in subsidies ($1.2 billion in foregone tax revenue + $325 million in direct expenditures) that's not spending $1.5 billion which would otherwise go to schools, libraries, parks, or social welfare programs.
The "corporate welfare" argument everyone is posting about the Amazon HQ in Long Island City is really, really bad - representing ignorance of how taxes and public finance work.
RT @baseballot: Overlooked: Not only did Democrats hold Senate losses to a minimum, but they also made their 2024 map a bit less vulnerable‚Ä¶
What's also important is that the new Amazon campus is proving that Republicans' fearmongering about $15 minimum wage, paid family leave, GENDA, etc is baseless. NY can have the strongest, pro-worker labor policies in the nation and it's not scaring businesses to go out-of-state.
Sure, there are genuine concerns about a massive new corporate campus in LIC, namely that MTA is going to have to improve subway, bus, and LIRR capacity to transport tens of thousands of new employees to the new Amazon campus. That capacity doesn't exist as of yet.
For Democrats who want more government revenues to pay for more funding for schools, subways, etc., do you realize how many billions of additional tax revenue the new Amazon HQ is going to bring to New York? We need businesses to come to NYC to pay for these things.
For Democrats who are supposed to be for universal health care in New York, these new jobs at Amazon are most likely going to be jobs with generous health insurance benefits. We're not talking about minimum wage jobs at Wal-Mart or McDonalds.  https://t.co/u0sI9GuOVT
For Democrats who are supposed to be for more jobs and economic opportunity in New York, the new Amazon campus will probably result in tens of thousands of new full-time jobs and spur a boom of temporary construction jobs in Queens.
Generally, I respect @SenGianaris - he's one of the most effective Democratic legislators in Albany. But he's making a real mistake by going full anti-economic development NIMBY like the @ZephyrTeachout @Ocasio20I8 wing of the party and fighting Amazon's HQ in Long Island City.

@reesetheone1 A difficult thing though is that - unlike the GOP, which has Marco Rubio, Brian Sandoval, Susana Martinez, etc. - Dems have a relatively paltry bench of Latino statewide officeholders. We have Robert Menendez, Senator Masto in NV and Lujan Grisham was just elected in NM.
Senate Democrats best pickup opportunities in 2020:	1. Colorado	2. Arizona	3. North Carolina	4. Montana	5. Maine

@dancluchey This reads like a book report written by an 8th grader who only read the back of the book and the Amazon review.
If, one day in 2032 I'm the campaign manager for the Democratic presidential campaign, I'm going to lobby hard for Governor Justin Fairfax, Senator Garlin Gilchrest, or Senator Mandela Barnes to be on that ticket to solidify the campaign in Southern/Midwestern swing states.
Democrats can't have a national ticket with two white candidates. If Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren is on the top of the ticket in 2020, they have to make Kamala Harris or Andrew Gillum VP if they want to ^ turnout to 2008 levels in Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida, North Carolina.
Next time there's a vacancy for Governor or Senator, these guys will be the heir apparent. We're probably going to see Governor Justin Fairfax and Senator Garlin Gilchrest one day.
They're also giving young black Democrats a chance to reach statewide constituencies, and not be pigeonholed as the "Inner City candidate" as if they were still the State Senator from Newark or the South Side of Chicago.
Their running mates helped to get out the vote in black precincts. @TheOtherMandela definitely helped Tony Evers over the finish line vs. Scott Walker.
I think this helped otherwise boring white candidates (esp. wealthy white financiers J.B. Pritzker and Phil Murphy) shore up their progressive bona fides on civil rights, voting rights, and criminal justice reform.
Totally overlooked fact of the 2017-2018 gubernatorial races: now there's a whole new crop of black Lt. Governors in big states: @LGJustinFairfax in Virginia, @SheilaOliverNJ in New Jersey, @garlin in Michigan, @TheOtherMandela in Wisconsin, @JulianaforLG  in Illinois.

Clearly @BetoORourke shouldn't run for President. He should run for Senate in Texas again in 2020 vs. @JohnCornyn. He lost by only 2.6%. And Texas voters are trending more young, more college educated, more urban and suburban, more Hispanic, and more Asian with every election.

@adamess What really stood out to me about the Farrow article is how non-criminal the bombshell allegations really were. About half of Farrow's reporting was on how Schneiderman asked his girlfriend to get a tattoo removed - which is painful, and how that is ergo "emotional abuse", etc.
@adamess The strangulation accusation also seemed suspect to me. Is it possible that the author of the legislation that made strangulation a specific crime according to the Penal Code himself committed strangulation? Yes. Do I think he did? No.
@adamess specifically, the Farrow article alleges that he made a pass at a woman at a bar in the Hamptons, she rebuffed him, and so he slapped her. I find it really hard to imagine Schneiderman doing this - let alone in a public setting.

In the long run, I think that the #MeToo torpedoing of Eric Schneiderman will go down in the column alongside Al Franken: an allegation that cost an excellent public servant his career, even though the substance of the allegation may have been false.
I don't think the Nassau County DA wanted to go into details about how these allegations were rather flimsy, and honestly, it's hard to imagine them prosecuting and convicting anyone for assault on the facts alleged in the New Yorker article.
I don't interpret this as meaning "He totally committed a crime - but it was more than 5 years ago, had it been 6 months ago we would have totally prosecuted him". Not at all. SOL is just the bar to prosecution that requires no further explanation.
The quote everyone is going to parse to death will be of course: "I believe the women who shared their experiences with our investigation team, however legal impediments, including statutes of limitations, preclude criminal prosecution."

There are 472 stations - almost all in need o renovations. It makes most sense to close subway stations for 5 months at a time that are within easy walking distance of alternative stations. 116th Street and 135th Street B/C stations seem like the next logical candidates.
Aesthetics of the subway station do matter though. I'd rather spend 10 minutes waiting for a train at the clean, new 110th Street Station than 3 minutes at the Fordham Road Station - which is decrepit, falling apart, overwhelmingly hot and humid, and reeks of urine.
Reasonable minds can agree to disagree on the worthiness of MTA funds going to pure aesthetics. But a lot of the Enhancer Station Initiative improves the functioning of the subways too in ways that riders don't see directly (electrical work, plumbing, etc.)
The new countdown clocks make it very easy to know how long you have to wait until the next train or how to find another route.
Some of the design is a bit... user aggressive. The station design intentionally dissuades homeless people from sleeping here. But this feels like a cleaner place to rest standing on the platform versus the wooden bucket seats found elsewhere. https://t.co/3nAJHn5DbN
The new station feels very safe. It's extremely well-lit. Textured steel plates on the entrance stairwells reduce risk of slip &amp; falls. There are emergency call boxes distributed every 100 feet or so.

tbh, I don't know why @rockhall keeps nominating LL Cool J. Yeah, he helped make rap commercial - but he really only had one album, and I don't think Radio stands the test of time. Everything he made after 1990 is unlistenable.
I'm sad I can only vote for 5. This year's ballot is really strong. Todd Rundgren, Def Leppard, Janet Jackson are all extremely deserving and they will inevitably be inducted (if not this year, the next).
Rufus/Chaka Khan made 5 or 6 great funk albums. "Tell Me Something Good", "Ain't Nobody" are great songs. I'd vote for @ChakaKhan over @JanetJackson because the latter owes a lot to the former.
The Zombies are also deserving. Odessey and Oracle is a haunting album. "She's Not There", "Time of the Season" were excellent singles. Strange how this great British Invasion band was overlooked. @rockhall #rockhall2019
The Cure is also incredibly deserving. How many bands can honestly say that they carved out a new genre? @rockhall #rockhall2019
Roxy Music is one of my personal favorites. Brian Eno and Bryan Ferry's art rock/prog rock/glam tock collective was truly inventive, pushed the boundaries of what you could do with a rock band. @rockhall #rockhall2019
Radiohead should be a no-brainer. OK Computer, Kid A, Amnesiac were truly perfect albums. @rockhall
My vote:	1. Radiohead	2. Roxy Music	3. The Cure	4. The Zombies	5. Chaka Khan / Rufus	@rockhall #rockhall2019

After Susan Collins announced she was voting aye on Kavanaugh, Manchin's vote was inconsequential. His aye vote changed nothing. A nay vote would have changed nothing - it would have been a meaningless protest vote.
If Susan Collins had voted nay, and then Manchin had voted aye on Kavanaugh, I would be righteously indignant at Manchin - but that alt history didn't happen, that's not the reality we live in.

Susan Collins voted aye on every SCOTUS nominee since she's been in office - Roberts, Alito, Sotomayor, Kagan, Gorsuch - but for two: Garland and Miers - who never came up for a vote. She had never voted nay. It's hard to imagine that she was ever going to vote nay on Kavanaugh.

By discouraging voters to vote for the Democratic nominee for Governor of New York, it is clear that @ZephyrTeachout does not have New Yorkers' best interests at heart. The only reason she keeps on running for office (and losing) is to placate her own ego.
If @ZephyrTeachout can't acknowledge there's a difference, that Molinaro will allow fracking, Cuomo won't; that Cuomo will legalize weed, Molinaro will keep it illegal; Cuomo will enact criminal justice reforms, Molinaro won't - she is being willfully ignorant of public policy.
With a month to go before the general election, @ZephyrTeachout is still refusing to endorse the top of the Democratic ticket.

I'll be interested to read Gorsuch's 8th Amendment jurisprudence for the first time. But I have little faith that the avowed strict textualist would find for Madison. The text of the Constitution explicitly allowed for punishing criminals of all stripes on the gallows.
If the Court were 5-4 with Kavanaugh, Madison will almost certainly be executed, despite the fact that after multiple strokes much of his brain tissue is dead, he suffers from extreme cognitive impairment, he is incontinent and can hardly speak.
However, in a 4-4 Court, I think it's unlikely that a majority finds for Madison. I have very little faith in Chief Justice Roberts on criminal justice matters, let alone on 8th Amendment cases.
Had Anthony Kennedy still been on the Court, the author of Hall v. Florida and cosigner on Atkins v. Virginia would have found the execution of Vernon Madison to be cruel and unusual punishment.

The identity of Brett Kavanaugh as the alleged perpetrator is central to Dr. Ford's accusation that she was the victim of assault and attempted sexual assault.
When @SenatorDurbin asked, "With what degree of certainty do you believe Kavanaugh assaulted you?"		Ford replied: "100 percent."
Ford's testimony can't possibly be 50% truthful - but for the identity of the alleged perpetrator of attempted sexual assault, among the most intimate of crimes.
The more you think about it, the more untenable is @SenateGOP's #IHalfBelieveWomen theory: "I believe that something terrible happened to Dr. Ford, but I do not believe that Brett Kavanaugh did it." https://t.co/SLvklio2Q8
Utterly baffled by the fact that so many people - lawyers even - are convinced that Dr. Ford was lying in her testimony to Congress - that she committed perjury on a kamikaze mission to destroy Kavanaugh. 		I don't see an iota of evidence to corroborate the theory that Ford lied.
Worth noting that over the course of the Kavanaugh hearings, @SenateGOP, especially @tedcruz, were trying to pre-emptively discredit Mark Judge as a potential witness.
It's really hard to see how Kavanaugh can impartially adjudicate any appeals arising from sexual offense cases from hereon out, either at SCOTUS or at the D.C. Circuit.

15. @JumaaneWilliams Williams will be a formidable candidate for Mayor in 2021.
14. Political discourse you see on Facebook and Twitter is not at all representative of public opinion. Your friends from Amherst, your not-for-profit office, and your adult kickball league are a very small, insular sliver of voters.
13. (Honestly, if Bernie Sanders' brand of vacuous, fact and economics-free Socialism doesn‚Äôt sell well among Bronx Democrats, why would you think it will sell better among swing voters in Florida, Ohio, Iowa, or Wisconsin? But I digress...)
12. Self-described "progressives" should do a better job listening to the people whose interests they claim to represent.
11. Working class and middle class voters seem to have much more practical, tangible definitions of what constitutes ‚Äúprogressivism‚Äù - they voted for candidates who vowed to focus on union issues: jobs, wages, health insurance, paid family leave.
10. Even among Democrats, it‚Äôs hard to win an election by vowing to literally double all income taxes, double all property taxes for goopy dreams of Socialism. You can‚Äôt just dismiss this as ‚Äúbourgeois reactionism‚Äù.
9. New York City is never going to be able to enact major changes to urban infrastructure by riding roughshod over the suburbs and Upstate. "I want better subways AND peoplewho DON'T ride the subway should pay $38 billion more taxes to pay for it!" is our wall with Mexico.
8. Manhattanites and Brooklynites are far more provincial than we'd like to admit. It's easy to forget that 57% of the population of New York doesn't live in the City. Erie County  and Monroe County together have more people and far more eligible voters than Manhattan.
7.  Candidates running on Single Payer Health Insurance, abolishing college tuition and abolishing market rents performed really well among wealthy Caucasians in the Upper West Side, Park Slope, Williamsburg, New Paltz, and Ithaca.
5. But we're trading 6 Democrats who now caucus under Andrea Stewart-Cousins for.... 6 Democrats who will ALSO caucus under Andrea Stewart-Cousins!!!!!!!!! I'll save my champagne for Tish James.

@M_G_Stone @indiemusicfan9 @ZephyrTeachout @BDSmovement @CynthiaNixon By your logic, students divesting the Hampshire College endowment doesn't by itself constitute participating in BDS, Roger Waters, Lorde and Shakira cancelling tour dates in Tel Aviv doesn't constitute participating in BDS. By your logic, then nothing does.
@M_G_Stone @theinstantwin @indiemusicfan9 @ZephyrTeachout @BDSmovement @CynthiaNixon Your logic here as to what constitutes participating in BDS contradicts the @BDSmovement 's own literature. Barghouti's thesis in his BDS manifesto is that every economic actor should resist the Israeli occupation by resisting economic pressure where they can.
You're never gonna believe this, but I really respect @CynthiaNixon's bagel order. It's an acquired taste.
@theinstantwin @M_G_Stone @indiemusicfan9 @ZephyrTeachout @BDSmovement @CynthiaNixon So by your logic, if a Blue Lives Matter member decides to boycott Nike sneakers - but still watches NFL games and 49ers merchandise, he is not participating in any such boycott because he is only partaking in 1/3?
@verticalblank That is incredibly surprising to me.
I interpret Bernie Sanders' non-intervention in the NY primary to mean that (1) he's a bit more pragmatic than Our Revolution, Justice Dems, etc.; and (2) he realizes the practical consequences of alienating a Governor of New York who's enacted some of his pet policies.
@tomwatson It seems that St. Bernie's actually a tick more pragmatic than Our Revolution, the Justice Democrats, etc., no? He realizes the practical consequences of alienating a sitting Governor of New York who enacted some of his pet policy ideas?
@M_G_Stone @indiemusicfan9 @ZephyrTeachout @BDSmovement @CynthiaNixon Boycotting an Israeli venue constitutes participating in BDS. An individual can't conduct economic sanctions, it's very unlikely than an individual can conduct divestment unless they personally own property in Israel.
@M_G_Stone @indiemusicfan9 @ZephyrTeachout @BDSmovement @CynthiaNixon I've read the BDS manifesto by Omar Barghouti - the founder of the @BDSmovement. Barghouti thinks that actors and musicians' boycott of Israeli venues in the West Bank constitutes participation in his movement. Otherwise, why does Barghouti call on them to do so?
@M_G_Stone @indiemusicfan9 @ZephyrTeachout @BDSmovement @CynthiaNixon BDS calls for consumers to not buy Ahava skin products, Tribe hummus, SodaStream, colleges to not invite Israeli lecturers, and for musicians and actors to not perform in Israel to protest the Occupation. @CynthiaNixon very publicy participated in the latter boycott.
@M_G_Stone @indiemusicfan9 @ZephyrTeachout @BDSmovement @CynthiaNixon I beg your pardon, what does the B in BDS stand for?
@indiemusicfan9 @ZephyrTeachout @BDSmovement So you're arguing that @CynthiaNixon didn't sign the 2010 letter endorsing the boycott of Israeli settlements in the West Bank? That would be false, because she did.
@ZephyrTeachout @BDSmovement This is the open letter that @CynthiaNixon signed, alongside Vanessa Redgrave, Stephen Sondheim, Tony Kushner, Julianne Moore, Ethan Hawke, and Roseanne Barr. https://t.co/oB9U6QfIUx
@ZephyrTeachout I think that it's a false statement to say that the mailer about Cynthia Nixon is "false". She does support the @BDSmovement. https://t.co/0tswEsCe3O
RT @NickReisman: :stares dead eyed into the void: Going to be a fun week.
@TweetBenMax @SienaResearch MALONEY in the lead?!?!!??!?? What?
But is the Cuomo camp's jab at Nixon on boycotting Israeli settlements worse than the Nixon camp's punch that Cuomo committed bribery and obstructed justice to thwart prosecution of Harvey Weinstein? These primary contenders started hitting below the belt long ago...
Did the NY State Democratic Committee commit an aveira by issuing this hyperbolic mailer? Yes, this is inappropriate for the NY State Democratic Committee. This 2018 campaign season is ugly enough already, I don't want my $ to go towards gutter politics.
So I suppose if the @CynthiaNixon position is that "I am participating in a theatrical boycott of Israeli settlements in the West Bank - but I never called for boycott AND sanctions AND divestment" I suppose that is accurate. But perhaps not an enviable position to stake out.
Even among liberal Jews like myself - who believe in Palestinian statehood and abhor Netanyahu, a lot us are opposed to boycotts of Israel and Israeli products, not because we support the Occupation - we don't - but because a lot of BDS authors give off a very ((( )))) vibe.
I fear that there are some pockets of New York progressive circles in which Thomas Lopez-Pierre, Linda Sarsour, Tamika Mallory, etc. find receptive audiences. Over the 2010s, a distinct neo-Anti-Semitism has resurfaced in the Alt Left as much as it has in the Alt Right.
I do legitimately fear that many Alt Left candidates imbibe from a school of tropes adjacent to classic anti-Semitism. Sometimes when DSA candidates demagogue on Wall Street, the Real Estate Industry, and Jews moving North of Morningside Heights, I hear ((( ))) brackets.
... So is it "dishonest" or "below the belt" to claim that a candidate for Governor of New York supports boycotting Israel? I'm not so sure. https://t.co/EwSitzVaeu
The way I read the 2010 letter that @CynthiaNixon signed, she endorsed a boycott of theatrical performances in the West Bank settlements - which is more modest than the comprehensive sanctions @BDSmovement calls for. But it is a boycott to protest Israeli policy in the West Bank. https://t.co/yeCaNLfSZC
I mean, sure, I'm 100% here for a debate on the merits of boycotting SodaStream, Ahava, Tribe hummus, and other products manufactured in the West Bank versus also boycotting products manufactured in Tel Aviv or Haifa. I live for these debates!
Did anyone on the @CynthiaNixon campaign really think that this would not be an issue in a Democratic primary for Governor of New York? Really?
... and if Vanessa Redgrave, Stephen Sondheim, Tony Kushner, Roseanne Barr, Julianne Moore, or Ethan Hawke were to ever run for public office, it would be 100% fair game to discuss their stance on this issue too.
In all fairness, I do think the Israeli settlements in the West Bank are illegal, and the hit piece mailer on @CynthiaNixon re: the @BDSmovement was a bit over the top. However, if you're going to lend your name to a cause, it's perfectly fair game in a campaign season. https://t.co/KwL6AEPS4X

... But banning "fracked gas pipelines" is not a serious environmental policy. It's just a faux-woke word salad. A candidate spitballing the Governor of New York's environmental policy for not banning "fracked gas pipelines" doesn't know what she/he is talking about.
Should NY pipelines be safer? Yes. Should NY develop more nuclear, hydroelectric, wind, and solar power so that we can phase out natural gas over time to meet the state's Clean Power Plan obligations to reduce carbon pollution? Of course.
Generally, pipelines are an extremely more safe mode of transportation than a fleet of tanker trucks hauling compressed natural gas on New York's highways. Building pipelines incredibly reduces the risk of catastrophic accidents and explosions.
You also have to acknowledge that the most basic way to transport natural gas from a well pad in Pennsylvania to a power plant in New York is via tanker trucks. This mode of transportation is very dangerous. Driving behind a CNG tanker is terrifying. 		https://t.co/Co9kHKrO0U
You also have to acknowledge the basic fact that right now, ~40% of New York's electricity comes from natural gas, fracked in Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, or elsewhere, and transported via tanker trucks or pipelines to LNG production sites and to power plants.
Natural gas is a bridge fuel. It pollutes, but the generation of energy from natural gas is so much less polluting than generation from coal. If you don't acknowledge this basic fact, you're skimming over elementary environmental science.
The fact is that roughly 40% of all energy consumed in New York is generated from natural gas. This is largely because the Pataki and Cuomo administrations have largely phased out coal power plants since 1995 - replacing them mostly with natural gas generators. https://t.co/SR1FS1r61T
However, that's not what Nixon/Williams/Teachout are talking about. They're demagoguing, pretending that the Governor of New York should - or could - categorically ban the transportation of natural gas. This is simply a false assumption.
Yes, there are safety concerns with gas pipelines. Old, decayed gas lines in the city can be susceptible to leaks and explosions. New York does need to regulate gas lines better. 		https://t.co/uwACFNiQv1
However, the pollution risks from transit of gas via pipelines are incredibly minimal compared to the fracking itself. @CynthiaNixon @JumaaneWilliams @ZephyrTeachout are subscribing to crazypants Occupy Wall Street junk science, pseudo-environmentalism.	https://t.co/iqTUe2sOrm
There are other pollution concerns from the process of hydraulic fracturing. Namely, air pollution from methane gas that is released from frack pads. That is why gas drilling companies should be required to flare their well pads.
The water pollution risks from fracking are almost entirely due to (1) the holding of fracking wastewater in above-ground pools; (2) transit of fracking wastewater to industrial wastewater treatment plants, and - to a lesser degree - (3) the fracking itself.
If you are indeed an environmentalist concerned about water pollution caused by hydraulic fracturing of natural gas, the fact is that fracking in New York is illegal. We are the only state with significant Marcellus Shale deposits that bans fracking. 		https://t.co/sV1gqaH53V
Mind you, I say this as someone who is passionate about the Clean Water Act, who clerked in the EPA Water Enforcement Division, who is so obsessed with fracking that all of my 1L law professors made their final exam questions about fracking.
Of the many stupid things about the 2018 New York primary season, one of the most dismaying things has been the trafficking in anti-science, pseudo-environmentalism amongst so-called "progressives". https://t.co/0YGOuwh8HD

THE MOST IMPORTANT DETAIL!
@TheStagmania @tomwatson @TweetBenMax @KarenAnds @CynthiaNixon Do you really call "CUOMO HASN'T REALLY BANNED FRACKING" or "CUOMO REFUSED SINGLE PAYER" an honest discussion about policy?
@halfalpine @TishJames @ZephyrTeachout Not the slightest. @ZephyrTeachout came across like she couldn't prosecute a simple DWI case. She seems utterly uninterested in the criminal and civil enforcement matters that make up 99% of the AG's case load. She came across as utterly unqualified to manage 650 prosecutors.
24. Quite bluntly, I'm quite concerned that @ZephyrTeachout might win the AG race. I don't think she knows how to prosecute a simple DWI case - let alone a difficult racketeering case. She comes across as utterly unqualified to manage an office of 650 prosecutors.
23. Couldn't help but note that @ZephyrTeachout kept on talking about how "I was there in the courtroom" when the Percoco or Kaloyeros case happened - as a passive observer - very misleadingly implying that she worked on those anti-corruption prosecutions. She didn't.
22. It was telling @ZephyrTeachout kept on invoking this 1 death penalty defense case she did for a non-profit in North Carolina right out of law school. It seems like it's the only actual case she's ever really worked on.
21. @LeeciaEve seems like a great deputy or advisor to the Attorney General. She doesn't seem to have the gravitas to fill the bully pulpit.
20. My friend who came to the debate said he's voting for @RepSeanMaloney. Maloney was the only candidate who straightforwardly answered every question - and the most honestly. He didn't rely on rehearsed applause lines.
19. I came away from this forum utterly convinced that I'm voting for @TishJames. She came across as a commanding prosecutor. She would make a fine Attorney General.
18. @TishJames invokes Brooklyn pioneer Shirley Chisholm's 1972 campaign: "I am unbossed and unbought" - a rebuttal to the NYT Op-Ed page.
17. Letitia James is the only candidate on this stage who has sued ______________.
16. Did you know that Zephyr Teachout is an anti-corruption expert?
15. @TishJames is making the case that she would be a Rich Cordray-like prosecutor on mortgage lenders, student loan providers, etc.
14. Every candidate wants to take a wrecking ball to JCOPE (Joint Commission on Public Integrity). But no one is willing to admit that the Attorney General has _no_ authority to do so! They seem to be demagoguing.
13. For such a heated race, James and Teachout are going at remarkable lengths to present as girlfriends, smiling and laughing with each other - and agreeing on just about everything. This is not last week's @NYGovCuomo v. @CynthiaNixon debate!
12. @TishJames wants the NY legislature to give her original jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute corruption in Albany. Encroaching on territory Teachout claimed as her exclusive domain!
11. One of the best, understated, comments tonight came from @RepSeanMaloney - intoning that it would be inappropriate for an AG candidate to promise prosecutions of specific individuals. He's right. (seems to be implicit criticism of Teachout)
10. @TishJames vows to establish a Convictions Integrity Unit in the NY AG's office to vacate wrongful convictions - taking a page from former Kings County DA Kenneth Thompson.
9. All of the candidates agree on expanding the executive officer authorizing AG's power to prosecute police officers involved in shootings of unarmed citizens - to corrections officers and to those incidents that don't include a killing.
8. @RepSeanMaloney is taking the more realistic position that NY's highest law enforcement officer simply can't #AbolishICE. @LeeciaEve vows to have NY State Troopers arrest ICE agents making civil arrests at NY courthouses.
7. @TishJames is tacking to the left by vowing to support #AbolishICE - twice for good measure.
@CarolineVitale Repeating a hashtag is not a policy statement for an AG candidate. The legislature and Governor would have to enact bail reform - not the AG.
6. Everyone seems to be working under the lingering stench of Eric Schneiderman. But like it or not, they're inheriting 8 years of Schneiderman-initiated cases (most of them very very good ones). No one seems eager to criticize Schneiderman's actual legal work.
5. @LeeciaEve. Who? Her resume demonstrates such accomplishment, but she is getting no press. Would probably be a Deputy AG to whomever she endorses later on.
4. @RepSeanMaloney would be a formidable candidate - he's actually practiced law for years in the private sector at Kirkland &amp; Ellis, Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher. But I don't see how he breaks into the top 2. He seems to be running for Governor of NY in 2022.
3. @ZephyrTeachout seems like a one trick pony. She wrote a book on corruption, she doesn't like Trump, she doesn't like Cuomo. But she has truly little but bromides to say about criminal law, environmental law, landlord-tenant law - ANYTHING other than corruption.
2. @TishJames started this race as the frontrunner, but since the NYT and Daily News endorsed Teachout, she seems to be doubling down on the anti-corruption, anti-Albany, anti-Trump rhetoric.
1. The candidates are trying to out anti-Trump each other so much that it's monotonous by now. We get it - you're going to sue Donald Trump. It's crowding out the mundane criminal and civil enforcement matters that make up the Attorney General of New York's job.

@TweetBenMax There would have been a much more substantive debate on actual issues - instead of the Democratic Socialists of America nonsense we've had to suffer through the past 6 months.
Honestly though, I don't understand the moral universe in which the NYT inhabits endorsing Andrew Cuomo - because he's an accomplished governor and legislator - AND ALSO endorsing Zephyr Teachout over Tish James - because she wrote a book and some law review articles.
I'll note that NYT is subscribing to the flawed history that Nixon "pushed" Cuomo to become a criminal justice reformer. He had been working on #RaisetheAge, marijuana decrim, bail reform, discovery reform, speedy trial reform long before Nixon announced her candidacy on 3/19.

@JordanGPittman I think the best analogy for McCain on civil rights would be Harry Truman. He started his career as an opponent of some civil rights legislation, evolved over time to become a reserved civil rights proponent, but was still a stodgy square late in life.

15. Or, do you think it is more likely that the @CynthiaNixon campaign, 30 points down in the polls, commissioned the amateur bloggers at Sludge to concoct this bizarre, absurd accusation that the Governor of New York committed felonies to aid indicted rapist Harvey Weinstein?
14. For $25,000? Really? This is a two-term incumbent Governor of New York who had racked up more than $6 million by July this year. Do you really think the Cuomo campaign needs $25,000 so badly that he's willing to commit bribery and obstruct justice for an accused rapist?
13. Many people distrust Cuomo, for many reasons. But here you're accusing him of committing bribery and obstruction of justice - among other felonies - to aid Harvey Weinstein - an accused rapist. WHY would the Governor of New York be so motivated to commit these crimes?
12. The idea that the Governor of New York then decided to quash an investigation into the NY DA's office - which he had himself ordered - because he received a quid pro quo from a national law firm that counts among its 1,000s of clients Mr. Weinstein - is outlandish and absurd.
11. In March 2018, after the reports of sexual assault vs. Harvey Weinstein were published, and reports that the NY County DA knew but hadn't prosecuted vigorously, Gov. Cuomo ordered an investigation into the DA's inaction - an extraordinary remedy. 		https://t.co/6hLdaPxQep

@TweetBenMax Let's see how many any votes there are in the NY Senate come January 2019. Which Senators would be sponsors? Which would be on the fence?
@TweetBenMax I'm not sure what additional laws would prevent future Percoco's and future Kaloyeros's. Clearly, bribery is already a felony - and both were convicted with the statutes on the books.
@BobbyChesney Sally's.
@jaymart222 And careful assuming residents in Astoria, Williamsburg, and Red Hook don't want the BQX. Many do - and people who don't live there yet, who haven't been born yet, will.  It's just old people with cars who show up to community meetings and are  really loud who don't want this.
7. As for the merits, the grand jury indicted Weinstein on May 30, 2018. The next day, what's the point of investigating why the DA hadn't pursued charges against Weinstein - who was by this point indicted? There is a very logical reason the investigation ended!
6. This isn't real journalism. They're taking 22 year old bloggers to search through Cuomo's donors - which is in the public domain - and grasping at straws to find some connection by 6 degrees of separation from tabloid news stories. Here, LITERALLY Harvey Weinstein.
5. This seems like a cottage industry of scandalmongering as hired guns by the @CynthiaNixon campaign. Remember that terrible hitpiece The Intercept that accused Cuomo of not abolishing ICE because a landlord that rents to ICE once donated to his campaign?
4. Really it seems like the @CynthiaNixon plant article is an amalgam of multiple tropes of accusation: A) "Cuomo accepts bribes" B) "Cuomo obstructs justice" C) "Cuomo literally covered up #MeToo scandals". 		Mishmashing them all together is simply lazy scandalmongering.
3. For the past 5 months, the @CynthiaNixon has been repeatedly trying to accuse Cuomo of some guilt by association with sexual harassment, has repeatedly invoked the Harvey Weinstein case. Accusing Cuomo himself of guilt by association WITH Harvey Weinstein is a bridge too far.
2. Is Sludge a real news publication? Really? Isn't this the fictional news-zine where Zoe Barnes worked on House of Cards?

I just can't wait for it to be 2 weeks from now when this utterly stupid, shrill, and self-destructive Democratic primary season will finally be over.
10A. If you didn't catch it yet, this was my big policy takeaway from the debate last night. If Democrats win a majority in the State Senate, @NYGovCuomo @AndreaSCousins @CarlHeastie are probably going to legalize marijuana outright, Colorado-style. https://t.co/WsJle3mGBC
9A. I really did not expect this much of a reaction to the name of the Mario Cuomo Bridge. I thought it was a contrived controversy.
@TweetBenMax It seemed clear that Cuomo is going to have his hands full overhauling the NYC subways and NYCHA properties. And if Democrats get a majority in the State Senate, there's a bottleneck of criminal justice reform bills. In the debate he also floated a marijuana legalization bill.
@courtneycgross This is garbage "investigative journalism" obviously planted by the Nixon campaign. Weinstein was indicted on May 30, 2018. In June 2018, what point was there in the state investigating the Manhattan DA's slowness in prosecuting Weinstein - once had been indicted?
@tribelaw @CynthiaNixon Cuomo was sort of right. She does have an S corporation for tax avoidance purposes, as do many in show biz. She makes donations to various candidates - many of whom have authority over matters regulating her and her S corp. https://t.co/59dPtRGWKa
@NicholsUprising @CynthiaNixon @andrewcuomo We must have not been watching the same debate. Her non-answer to that first question - "How are you prepared to be Governor of New York" - was devastating. Cringe-worthy. 		https://t.co/F26UxC3xFD
12. This debate reminded me most of Joe Biden v. Sarah Palin in 2008. 		Cuomo has decades of institutional knowledge - and baggage - on specific public policy questions. 		Nixon has a greatest hits of one liners - but no business at all running New York State government.
11. In conclusion, it's good for there to be competitive Democratic primary elections. But I wish Cuomo's competitor had been someone like @MinerForNY or @JumaaneWilliams who could actually have a substantive debate on the issues.
10. But on a policy note, it really sounded like 2019 is going to start with a legislative proposal by @NYGovCuomo to legalize, regulate, and tax marijuana sales as per the DOH Report. 		HOW IS THIS NOT BIGGER NEWS?!?!
9. Is anyone really angry that Governor Andrew Cuomo decided to name the new Tappan Zee Bridge the Mario Cuomo Bridge? People are still going to call it the Tappan Zee Bridge - just like no one calls the Queensboro Bridge the Ed Koch Bridge.
8. But Cuomo's answer still felt wholly unsatisfying. Cuomo himself has never been accused by @PreetBharara or any other prosecutor of a crime. But that's not the point. The Governor needs to do a better job of hiring and vetting his staffers.
7. Back to Cuomo, his soliloquy on Joseph Percoco was essentially truthful. Does anyone actually think that the Governor of New York - who is an attorney, a former prosecutor- knew that Percoco had accepted bribes - a felony - and condoned it?
6. He needed to make a dig at his opponent on something, but what else could he really say? "Sex and the City 2 was a bad movie and it should have never been made!"?
5. To be fair to @CynthiaNixon, the one real dig that Cuomo made at her - alleging hypocrisy for her use of her S corporation for her personal finances - was sorta true but sorta false. She uses an S corp for tax avoidance, but I don't think The Fickle Mermaid Corp. donated $. https://t.co/2FpIs0i269
4. Even in the instantly-infamous "Stop interrupting" / "Stop lying" moment, Cuomo was in fact telling the truth about the structure of the MTA and the NYC Transit Authority. She had a point, but this wasn't the way to make it. 		https://t.co/KesTsIUBLT
3. I do not know how anyone could possibly watch this debate and conclude that @CynthiaNixon should be Governor of New York. She did not know basics of New York government, like how the budget works - or the MTA, or the New York State Senate.
2. However, it was clear they were giving two tiers of questions. The incumbent Governor was asked about specifics on MTA fair hikes and bridge tolls, they asked Nixon total softballs like "Should marijuana be legalized?".
1. The CBS moderators @mauriceduboistv and Marcia Kramer were far better than anything on ABC, CNN. They actually asked pointed, relevant questions directed to the two candidates' weaknesses.
Alright, I have many takes on that @NYGovCuomo / @CynthiaNixon debate. Biased of course, but more balanced than you would expect from me.

Even so, Florida Democrats have their work cut out for them. @AndrewGillum for Governor, @SenBillNelson for re-election, half a dozen competitive House races, and abolition of felon disenfranchisement on the ballot!
Where I'm skeptical of Gillum though is that I'm always going to have to be wary when progressive candidates claim whoppers like they're going to #AbolishICE and establish #MedicareForAll - as though a governor of a state could make radical changes to federal law.
Are swing voters in Orange County and Hillsborough County, Florida going to pull the lever for the candidate who wants to legalize marijuana and regulate gun sales? I'd sure like to think so. I don't see why they would vote for Obama but not for Gillum.
It looks more and more like Gwen Graham and Phil Levine were far more regional candidates than anyone was willing to admit. There was a North Florida Center-to-Liberal candidate, a South Florida Center-to-Liberal candidate, and Gillum racked up consistent votes across the state.
I'll be honest, I didn't think that Gillum had a chance in the primary. Every poll I had seen showed him in a distant 3rd place.

Probably the weakest of the insurgent candidates seems to be @SalazarSenate18. It doesn't make any sense that she's railing against the "IDC" when the incumbent Martin Dilan was _never_ affiliated with the IDC! She seems to be grasping at straws.
Likewise, I think @dianesavino is among the safest of the former IDC incumbents. She alone seems to have made herself a local institution in Staten Island, and she can claim credit for major reforms on marijuana law. Her opponent has made little headway.
To be blunt, it would be a disservice for progressive politics in New York if @TonyAvella is not in the next Democratic-majority State Senate.
Obviously, John Liu - the former NYC Comptroller - it by far the most accomplished insurgent. But the only problem for him is that he's trying to unseat @TonyAvella - by far among the most accomplished (and progressive) legislators of the incumbents.
Of the insurgent challengers to @NYSenDems incumbents, I think that Zellnor Myrie and Alessandra Biaggi have the best odds. They come across as knowledgeable.

@CynthiaNixon @zansari8 This is so patently false that I don't know where to begin. Do you even remember what was going on in 2011 in this country? Do you? Or did the Great Recession never register with you?
Had there been a McCain administration 2000-2008, there would have been a much greater Republican buy-in to moderately progressive reforms on environmental, social policy. He would have been pro-life, but I don't think he would have demagogued on same-sex marriage like W did.
Imagine how the Obama years may have been different if his Republican predecessor had enacted comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship and a cap-and-trade policy for carbon pollution? The Tea Party would have still arisen - but failed - under McCain.
I don't think a President McCain would have done anything to stem the subprime mortgage crisis. The 2008 financial meltdown would have still happened. Likewise, had McCain been President from 2001-2008, I could still see Obama being elected in 2008.
Noting that the rise in a xenophobic, anti-immigration faction among the Republican Party had its origins in response to Bush's push for immigration reform in 2006, I think the Tea Party&gt;Alt Right would have still happened under President McCain - maybe sooner.
I would like to think that President McCain may have been able to succeed with immigration reform legislation where Bush and Obama had not. Imagine how much different the country would be had some form of the "McCain-Kennedy" Immigration Bill become law? 		https://t.co/x5GiPSzK7D
The McCain administration would have made a priority of passing the Climate Stewardship Act - which would have created a cap-and-trade program for greenhouse gases. We could have made huge strides in mitigating global warming by now.		https://t.co/sZsqPJmAGt
A President McCain would have called for passage of the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act of 2002 in his first State of the Union, and it would have passed just the same. But it would have been called something besides "McCain-Feingold".
Domestically, I think McCain would pursued generally conservative Republican economic policies. But I think he would have been more like a Roosevelt-Taft progressive Republican who favored some reforms of banks, big businesses, and of course campaign finances.
Post 9/11, would President McCain have made a hard line on Iraq, Syria, Libya, Iran's state sponsorship of terrorist groups, and their nuclear, chemical, biological weapons programs? Of course. But he wouldn't have been nearly as ideologically driven.
Had President McCain brought bin Laden to justice, the Afghanistan War would not have seemed like such an unwinnable quagmire, there would not have been such an irrational urge among Americans to see U.S. tanks driving through an Arab capital. The U.S. may not have invaded Iraq.
It's really debatable whether the U.S. would have invaded Iraq in 2003. McCain had favored "regime change" since 1991, but Operation Iraqi Freedom was concocted by the Bush admin neocons Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, etc. A McCain admin may have been too focused on Afghanistan.
A jury would have sentenced Osama bin Laden to death. President McCain would have wrestled with the thought of commuting bin Laden's sentence to life, but demurred. Bin Laden would have been executed by lethal injection at the federal prison at Terre Haute, Indiana ~2007/2008.
Had @SenJohnMcCain been elected President in 2000, there could have been a civilian trial of Osama bin Laden at the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, he could have been convicted with due process under law.
It's debatable whether the conduct of the U.S. war in Afghanistan may have turned out any differently. Perhaps President McCain would have given his commanders more aggressive orders at the Battle of Tora Bora, and Osama bin Laden could have been apprehended on December 17, 2001.
High level detainees like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed would have been able to be prosecuted and convicted in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. There wouldn't have been any military commissions. Rasul, Hamdi, Hamdan wouldn't have been decided.
Detainees would have been entitled to habeas corpus from 9/12; Guantanamo Bay would have been an obscure naval station unknown to civilians. Abu Ghraib, "waterboarding", "enhanced interrogation techniques" would have never entered the American vocabulary.
I imagine that President McCain would have responded to 9/11 very differently in regards to detainees. The McCain administration would have made a point of adhering to the Geneva Conventions as applied to prisoners of war.
Suppose @SenJohnMcCain had went on to win the presidential election in 2000 or 2008; how do you think history would have been different?
The most important thing about @SenJohnMcCain was that he treated political rivals, members of the opposite party, and people with whom he disagreed with respect. It's a tradition we could use a lot more of nowadays.

@petertinti I guess it depends on the district. If Medicare for All is popular in a district then a Dem candidate should run on it. But if Medicare for All is wildly unpopular in a given district then a Democratic candidate shouldn't run on it. It's not the sine qua non of progressivism.
When all is said and done, all of the above policies are fully in place, the NYPD is going to make far fewer stops, far fewer arrests. There will be far fewer residents of New York City who suffer unnecessary encounters with the police, far fewer people sitting in prison cells.

The City Council passed the Right to Know Act which requires that in order to conduct a Stop and Frisk, NYPD officers have to ask for a person's consent. People can deny consent. NYPD then has to give a business card with their contact information. 		https://t.co/oeKhwZppA1
Terry stops are down 97% since 2011. Now NYPD can only conduct stop and frisks in instances where they have a "reasonable suspicion" that criminal activity is afoot in extreme cases like in Terry v. Ohio. https://t.co/o5m7V0nYjp
Since Bill de Blasio took office as Mayor in 2014 on a "Tale of Two Cities" platform, New York City quickly dropped the appeal in Floyd v. City of New York - which ordered the NYPD to reform its "stop and frisk" policy.		https://t.co/fOGUbRhZim
If you've been following legislative and executive action, the criminal justice reforms enacted in New York City and New York State have been remarkable.

@TweetBenMax @madinatoure @CynthiaNixon If you are elected Governor, and the New York State Senate Majority Leader is a Republican, how would you work with the opposing party? Are there any issues on which you could compromise and find common ground?
Likewise, I'm voting for @TishJames on September 13th. Anyone who has followed her career as NYC Public Advocate knows that she will be a capable attorney with a broad view of the public interest, an eye toward making the criminal justice system in New York more fair and just.
Likewise, Zephyr Teachout served as the treasurer for the Cynthia Nixon campaign THIS YEAR! If Nixon and Teachout won, the Governor's campaign treasurer would be the Attorney General! Surely, that is a conflict of interest - unlike merely having donors in common.
The AG is an independent elected office in New York, the AG should investigate misconduct in the executive branch, prosecute accordingly. But the notion that Letitia James' integrity as a prosecutor would be undermined because some people donated to both her and Cuomo is bunk.
The Times' purported reason for rejecting Letitia James does not hold water. If a person (say, myself) donates $10 to Andrew Cuomo and $10 to Letitia James, that does not establish a "conflict of interest". "Conflict of interest" is a very specific defined term, this isn't it. https://t.co/UtWdxCiPVz

As someone who would have been considered a Howard Dean/Ned Lamont progressive from the "democratic wing of the Democratic Party" 2004-2006, I want to take the word "progressive" back from the Socialist goons lacking a Schoolhouse Rock understanding of how a bill becomes a law.
Instead, DSA/Our Revolution/Justice Democrat "progressives" set impossible standards - the complete and total abolition of private health insurance, college tuition, subway fare, market rent - then pretend to be mad that Democrats didn't smash the State and Capitalism in 2 terms.
DSA/Our Revolution/Justice Democrat "progressives" aren't criticizing New York Democratic incumbents for the defining issues of 2010-present: the Marriage Equality Act, NY SAFE Act, the Compassionate Use Act, Paid Family Leave, #FightFor15, #Raisetheage, "New 421-a".
DSA/Our Revolution/Justice Democrat "progressives" aren't criticizing Democrats for the Affordable Care Act, Dodd-Frank, Recovery Act, the CFPB, the Clean Power Plan, U.S. v. Windsor, Obergefell, marijuana legalization - the liberal policy accomplishments which defined the 2010s
Instead of critiquing actual policies enacted by Democratic officeholders of the past 10-12 years, "progressives" are defining what is and what is not "progressive" by setting up ludicrously unattainable goalposts - and lambasting Democrats for not attaining the impossible.
The main reason I've soured on what passes for "progressive" politics nowadays is that it's become so defined by Democratic Socialist morons vilifying totally respectable liberal Democrats - to such an extent that it's almost entirely divorced from any actual tangible policies.

Criticism of the Democratic Party's internal politics is one thing. But slandering people who have dedicated their careers to advancing the civil rights and voting rights of American citizens is no way to win a Democratic primary for Governor.
However, in 2018, there is no longer an Anti-Civil Rights, Anti-Voting Rights faction of the Democratic Party of any consequence. We're talking about a handful of Dem legislators in Arkansas, Kentucky, West Virginia who haven't quite caught up with Obergefell v. Hodges.
In all fairness, the Democratic Party's history on civil rights has been inconsistent and uneven. Often, the Party has been slow to catch up to civil rights movements, and has embarrassingly kowtowed to entrenched social reactionaries (e.g., Richard Russell, Robert Byrd).

@poozer87 @BarackObama @AnnaMKaplan @SenatorPhillips Why are progressives activists not focusing on this race - which can flip the NY Senate - and instead getting bogged down in now pointless internecine primaries - which will surely _not_ flip the NY Senate?
It appears that, unlike some firebrands who will not be named, @BarackObama is acting as party leader, above the fray. He's not wading into contested primaries, only backing candidates who have won their respective nominations.
Nevertheless, it's bewildering why NY progressives are getting so bogged in the now-feckless Democratic primaries when just +1 Dem flip in the State Senate such as @AnnaMKaplan could render the former IDC/No IDC split irrelevant.
District 7 is one of the very few legitimate swing districts in the New York State Senate. @AnnaMKaplan is a great candidate, and I think she's going to pull it off. https://t.co/fLYEjRZlNP

Suppose, 5 years down the line, the NY Public Option is up and running, 400,000 subscribers have purchased NY's public health insurance, paying monthly premiums of $X00, providing an annual revenue of $Y00,000,000, spending $Z00,000,000. That would be a progressive success!
Unlike the NY Health Act that @CynthiaNixon and Berniecrats are howling about, a Public Option would not obligate New York to pay $226 billion in benefits, ^ the NY State budget from $171 billion to $397 billion, without any actual specific way to pay for it.
A NY Public Option would be superior to the NY Health Act because it would actually have a financing mechanism - an initial endowment, an annual operating budget funded by the state, and of course individual premiums from subscribers - less than market rate.
A NY Public Option would be superior to the NY Health Act because it would actually have a financing mechanism - an initial endowment, an annual operating budget funded by the state, and of course individual premiums from subscribers - less than market rate.
A NY Public Option would be superior to private plans like Blue Cross or United because it wouldn't waste $ on lavish executive compensation, shareholder dividends, etc. It would spend much less on marketing, etc. With such cost savings, it could afford below market rates.
If a Public Option were created out of existing Medicaid, Congress would have to pass legislation authorizing states like @brianschatz's  State Public Option Act. But why can't @NYGovCuomo @NYSA_Majority simply make a new Public Option Corporation separate from Medicaid?
There could be legal barriers to a NY Public Option. @NYGovCuomo, @TishJames might have to sue for New York's right to sell below market-rate health insurance under the Tenth Amendment, federalist principles.
A hypothetical NY Public Option Commission would have to figure out how a Public Option would be structured, how much $ it would need in an endowment, how to set rates, determine payment policies, etc. - everything a private health insurance provider does.
Suppose it is January 2019, and @NYGovCuomon in his State of the State address calls for the @NYSA_Majority @NYSenate to pass a budget that includes $4m for a Commission of former comptrollers, HHS commissioners, insurance executives to study the creation of a NY Public Option.
I think Andrew Cuomo should try to found a Public Option for New York residents. @NYGovCuomo could pass legislation to create a public corporation, similar to the State of New York Mortgage Agency, that sells health insurance below market rates.
@brianschatz's office needs to come up with a catchy hashtag. #MedicaidforAll polls much worse than #MedicareforAll I'm sure, but #PublicOptionforAllWhoWantIt is too much of a mouthful.
I'd like to revive a discussion of @brianschatz's legislation to establish a Public Option via Medicaid. Unlike #MedicareForAll, it's actually feasible, wouldn't require doubling all income taxes + payroll taxes. 		https://t.co/8m1cGihLWz
If there were an actual single payer bill with some means of raising $226 billion/y in revenue, I would love to parse the details of such legislation. Until that happens, no person with the slightest understanding of public finance could possibly think this is a serious proposal.
This isn't a matter of "I think that the New York Health Act overestimates revenues by 10% or it underestimates costs by 20% - it's that it. does. not. provide. for. any. revenue. mechanism. at. all.
If a single payer health insurance bill doesn't include a section explaining, tax bracket by tax bracket, how it is going to pay for providing single payer health insurance to the entire population, it is the Entertainment 720 of health care policy. 		https://t.co/5ceeQNNx7F
For reference, the FY 2019 New York State budget is $171 billion.
For the life of me, I do not understand how progressives can claim, with a straight face, that the New York Health Act - which would require the state to pay $226 billion/y with no funding mechanism to ^ tax revenue by $226 billion, is a good public policy.
@wideofthepost @kiragoldenberg @CynthiaNixon This is a joke, right? Federal Medicaid matching funds for the 6.4 million New Yorkers on Medicaid would be enough to pay for 20 million people?
@CynthiaNixon This bill is sheer fantasy. It doesn't even have a funding mechanism. You're making the equivalent promise of "I'm gonna build a wall and Mexico's gonna pay for it!"
@CynthiaNixon If you were Governor, what would the income tax surcharge be for households in New York, at all of the existing tax brackets, to pay for the NY Health Act? The bill doesn't even have actual numbers. 		Have you even thought about this?
@kiragoldenberg @CynthiaNixon It's easy for New York Assembly members to vote for a nonbinding resolution that "single payer health insurance is good". But the notion that a Governor would sign into law +$226 billion of health insurance spending w/o +$226 billion revenue is sheer nonsense and stupidity.
@kiragoldenberg @CynthiaNixon There's some vague mush about how there would be progressive taxation according to income level - but it doesn't actually lay out what the hypothetical tax brackets would be, or what the rates would be - things without which it can't possibly be actual finance legislation.
@kiragoldenberg @CynthiaNixon It's not. The New York Health Care Act doesn't actually say how it would come up with $226 billion/yearw - quadrupling the NY State budget. This is why the Vermont and California single payer bills failed - it's literally half of a single payer law, without a funding mechanism. https://t.co/0aRNPcYPN0

@PeteSikora1 @CynthiaNixon @TonyAvella @AndreaSCousins I think you're mistaken in conflating Avella et al. with Simcha Felder. 		Felder was cross-endorsed by Dems and GOP - never affiliated with IDC. Felder almost always voted against progressive legislation. Unlike Avella et al, Felder is now, on 7/25/18, caucusing under GOP.
@mirandayaver @BrendanNyhan Fair.
@PeteSikora1 @CynthiaNixon @TonyAvella @AndreaSCousins Sure, but aren't these claims of perfidy and treachery moot post the prodigal sons' return 4/3/18? If 8 state senators former caucus status is such a burning issue, why not recognize their present caucus status? Stewart-Cousins isn't calling for primaries vs. 8/31 Dem caucus.
@PeteSikora1 @CynthiaNixon @TonyAvella @AndreaSCousins I agree, Andrea Stewart-Cousins is an extremely competent Dem caucus leader without any of the ethical baggage of her 2 predecessors. Where the IDC went wrong was that they didn't give her a chance 1/1/13 &gt; 4/3/18.
@mirandayaver @BrendanNyhan I'd give you mad props if you can fold the NY gubernatorial primary into your routine.
@mirandayaver @BrendanNyhan Need to catch your set sometime! Not nearly enough standup comics have PhDs in political science.
@mirandayaver @BrendanNyhan Political standup is a subgenre that exists? Where? The only comedian i've seen who always gets overtly topical in her set is Michelle Wolf - and look where it got her...
@PeteSikora1 @CynthiaNixon @TonyAvella @AndreaSCousins Given the debacle of State Senate Democrats under Majority Leader Malcolm Smith 2009-2010, John Sampson 2011-2012 (both went to prison for bribery) I don't think it's beyond the pale that a faction of Senate Democrats broke away, caucused elsewhere.
@PeteSikora1 @CynthiaNixon @TonyAvella @AndreaSCousins I'm disappointed Democrats didn't pass Public Option, Climate Security Act, Immigration Reform, ENDA in 2010 but I'll give them credit for getting 50% of the way there. No one is shit-talking Barack Obama, Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi for not trying to pass a Public Option, etc.
@PeteSikora1 @CynthiaNixon @TonyAvella @AndreaSCousins First, I disagree in that they did achieve many progressive wins. Same-sex marriage, $15 minimum wage, paid family leave, SAFE Act, medical marijuana, #Raisetheage, GHG emissions &lt;40% 2030 &lt;80% 2050, new 421-a, fracking banned, closing Indian Point ain't nothing.
(if you don't know me enough by now, I think you can guess which which Democratic candidate for Governor of New York and which Democratic Senator from New York it was whom I worked for. I thought they were dedicated public servants and earnest liberals. I still do.)
But some Democrats on the state level are still getting a lot done on carbon pollution, health care, weed, gun control, LGBT rights. And the liberal promises of 2000s-2010s Democrats are still within reach during the next liberal cycle. (well, not a liberal Supreme Court)
I see the liberal promises of the Obama/Biden/Clinton years about half accomplished, half unfulfilled. Us Beltway Democrat types had a laundry list of policy objectives - much stymied by our constitutional system of checks + balances, unparalleled GOP filibusters, Joe Lieberman.
From my perspective, Democrats were _so close_ to establishing a Public Option for health insurance, a national cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions, immigration reform with a path to citizenship, universal background checks, ENDA, a 5-4 moderate&gt;liberal Supreme Court.
I also see Democratic politics 2002 to 2016 as remarkably successful. Pelosi, Reid, Obama, Biden saved us from Bush + the Great Recession, passed Affordable Care Act, Dodd-Frank, opened relations to Havana and Tehran, ended DADT. Same sex marriage, legal weed swept the nation.
I think part of it is that I had been hyper-involved in (then-progressive) Democratic politics since 2002, back when I worked on my first local campaign in New York. So the Democrats I had volunteered for, then considered insurgents, are now the Establishment.
Now if I tweet "Cory Booker should legalize marijuana" BernieBros be like "You're such a neoliberal shill. –ö–∞–ø–∏—Ç–∞–ª–∏–∑–º –±—É–¥–µ—Ç —Ä–∞–∑–¥–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω."
Back in 2006, a young Senate intern, I was considered off the reservation - a Howard Dean voter - because I wanted my Democratic Senator to go hard withdrawal on the Iraq War, close Guantanamo Bay, intervene in Darfur, legalize same-sex marriage, illegal immigrants, marijuana.
Asides from my hair starting to recede, the thing that saddens me the most about my political identity is that in 2006 I was considered a "progressive Democrat" but now, without changing my beliefs much, I'm a "centrist". WTF
@PeteSikora1 @CynthiaNixon @TonyAvella @AndreaSCousins 1/1/13 to 4/3/18, I agree. the IDC Senators took $15 minimum wage, paid family leave, SAFE Act - not single payer, bail reform, CCPA. 		1/1/11 to 12/31/12, I disagree b/c GOP had an outright majority. 		4/3/18-present, I disagree b/c GOP +Felder still has an outright majority.
@PeteSikora1 @CynthiaNixon @TonyAvella Hasn't this been moot since 4/3/18 when Avella et al recaucused under Stewart-Cousins? If Dems net +1 or +2 seats this year, @AndreaSCousins is Majority Leader, I think she'd call a vote on CCPA in 2019 - and that Avella would vote aye, Cuomo would sign it into law.
@PeteSikora1 @CynthiaNixon @TonyAvella Besides, I think the outrage over CCPA is a bit overblown. New York's SIP submitted to EPA under the Clean Power Plan is already to cut GHG emissions 40% by 2030, 80% by 2050. It's already the law in New York by agency law. CCPA is mostly redundant. https://t.co/skpC8tmM2x
@PeteSikora1 @CynthiaNixon @TonyAvella I think you're making a faulty syllogism: "1. Avella caucused under Flanagan until April '18; 2. Flanagan didn't schedule a vote on CCPA; 3. Cuomo did not actively intervene in Dem/IDC politics until April '18; 4. THEREFORE Cuomo and Avella oppose CCPA."
@TweetBenMax @ZephyrTeachout @GothamGazette Good she will have some time learning how to practice law in New York courts between Election Day and January 1st!
@PeteSikora1 @CynthiaNixon @TonyAvella To date, I've never understood the logic of the cockamamie theory pushed by the Young Turks/Our Revolution Left that Democrats in the New York State Senate introduce legislation because they want it to _not_ become law.
@PeteSikora1 @CynthiaNixon @TonyAvella When a legislator introduces a bill, that means that they intend for that bill to become law. Do you really think that if Andrea Stewart-Cousins is the Senate Majority Leader, and calls a vote on CCPA, @TonyAvella would vote "nay" on his own bill?

I wish her the best of luck getting any legislation passed in a Congress in which she has alienated 1/4 of the Democratic caucus by endorsing their primary challengers.

6. But this thesis is so incredibly wrong! If ICE were to be abolished, the U.S. General Services Administration would still have to pay the rent! Even if they didn't the landlord could easily obtain a new tenant in a matter of weeks!
5. @KateAronoff's article seems to imply that RXR Realty is so indebted to its tenants, that if ICE were to be abolished, RXR Realty would suffer - and so any contribution made by anyone associated with the landlord MUST be to suborn the Governor of NY to not #AbolishICE
4. RXR Realty has literally 1,000s of tenants. As a landlord, RXR Realty _does not have any stake_ in the policy interests of 1,000s of tenants - in fact, they're often diametrically opposite!
3. I agree with the Lefty argument that recipients of campaign contributions may be unduly influenced on policy by their campaign donors.		But does anyone really think that RXR Realty, which owns 93 buildings, really cares about immigration enforcement policy?

@petertinti I think it's possible to ascertain 2 truths simultaneously: 1. Kavanaugh is a Federalist Society hack who will overturn much of the 20th century's liberal jurisprudence; 2. Without the filibuster, nuked in 2017, the Senate minority party has no recourse.
Literally the only thing standing between here and people walking down Broadway with an AR-15 strapped to their shoulder is the moderating influence of Chief Justice Roberts - a prospect which should induce panic and horror.
This is SO FAR to the right of D.C. v. Heller, in which St. Antonin Scalia held that that right to bear arms doesn't apply to "dangerous and unusual weapons".
Brett Kavanaugh's  Second Amendment jurisprudence is BATSHIT CRAZY. https://t.co/Hk4i0BsSYj
My theory is that Trump likes Kavanaugh because he realized Democrats grilling him at the confirmation hearings about his days as a political hack will create yet a 3rd decade of politics defined by Bill Clinton's penis - to humiliate Hillary Clinton.
If @CC_Sabathia were to cap it off with a few games of October glory, I think that's the recipe for a Cooperstown-bound career. But I hope he sticks around at least a few more years while the Yankees are putting together a new dynasty.

Yes, Citizens United v. FEC was a terrible decision that gave too much power to Super PACs. Yes, Justice Kennedy myopically wished away the perception of corruption by entities that circumvent campaign finance regs. 		But sadly, this is now the realpolitik of campaigns in 2018.
I suppose some people believe it is more "honest" and "pure" to donate $20 to the treasury of John Doe for Congress, and put your head in the sand on the existence of Super PACs. But if you honestly believe that... someone should bring you up to speed on what's changed since 2010
Some liberal donors might want to give $1,000 to a general fund to support Democratic candidates, or pro-choice female candidates, or pro-gun control candidates, etc., but don't care to research the candidates in every single race.
Is there something inherently "corrupt" about donating $1,000 to a PAC that will spend that $1,000 towards a Senator's race, compared to donating $1,000 directly to that Senator's traditional campaign treasury? I really don't see why.
Some PACs are oriented to a specific race. e.g., Highway 31 was created for the sole purpose for fundraising in favor of Doug Jones' campaign for Senate, and vs. Roy Moore. Highway 31 raised $4.2m, they're at least partly to thank for Jones' surprise victory.
Another really important Democrat-aligned PAC is Women Vote! - which has raised $5m for female Democratic candidates for House races in California, Texas, Florida, Illinois, etc. If @HouseDemocrats win a majority in 2018, it may be largely because of Women Vote!
Perhaps the most important Democrat-aligned Super PACs are Senate Majority PAC and House Majority PAC, which have raised so far $81m for Dem candidates in tough races (and little homegrown fundraising) like Claire McCaskill and Jon Tester.
I agree with progressives' critiques about the undemocratic influence of political action committees, but they are an inevitable result of the post-Citizens United campaign landscape. Why should Dems unilaterally disarm, and let GOP carpetbomb a district with super PAC $?
I see the institutions of Congress - which reward seniority, compromise, and collegiality - as headwinds to the anti-Establishment faction in the Democratic Party. It's hard to get 218 colleagues to vote for your bill if you've fundraised for half of their primary challengers.

@bluenbama @CynthiaNixon I have a hard time believing that any funds donated to the Andrew Cuomo for Governor campaign in 2002 or the Andrew Cuomo for Attorney General campaign in 2006 weren't already spent more than a decade ago.
@bluenbama @CynthiaNixon If you're alleging that there was some corrupt bargain between Trump and Cuomo, what are you alleging was Cuomo's quid pro quo?
Progressives are more than a bit sanctimonious when they cry that every large donation to their opponents, made by wealthy individuals, are in fact "Corruption!" - but every large donation to their own campaigns, also made by wealthy individuals, are not.
Looks like Andrew Cuomo made an unforced error by, in 2002, not being prescient enough to realize that Trump would go onto become President and lead a wave of unprecedented Fascism. But unsure how many defunct campaigns are expected to hold onto $64K 16 years later. https://t.co/R3cX9Ft2PB
@bluenbama @CynthiaNixon 16 years after this campaign is done, in 2034, and it turns out that one of the donors to the Cynthia Nixon campaign in 2018 did A Bad Thing, do you really think that a) the campaign entity will still exist? b) the campaign funds will still be there? Highly unlikely.

To my friends who decry my "Neoliberalism": how can you reconcile #Resistance vs. Trump on all fronts, no quarter, no compromise, taking no prisoners - but conceding 100% of Trump's isolationist policy on NAFTA, TPP, punitive trade wars with Canada, Mexico, all of Europe?
10 years ago, @Dennis_Kucinich ran a campaign where he promised, in his first day in office, to withdraw the U.S. from NAFTA and the WTO. 10 years ago, it was rightly mocked as nuttery. Amazingly, Trump is implementing Kucinich's trade platform verbatim. 		https://t.co/AUcY6PaWn5
We can be the party of the industrial workers, the party of the downtrodden middle class in Duluth, Sheboygan, and Toledo, without being the party of economic illiteracy and suicidal stupidity.
I'm OK with the Democrats rekindling the fiery populist rhetoric of the Bryan&gt;Wilson&gt;Roosevelt&gt;Truman Era. But I'm very not OK with my party re-adopting the terrible, no good, very bad protectionism and tariff policy of 100 years ago.
Can someone please explain to me the ideology behind the Trump administration's intentional misspellings? Is it base pandering to "poorly educated voters"? Or an Alt Right code to express contempt for foreign nations? https://t.co/98c5rk5Hoq
@SecPompeo @USAsiaPacific @USEmbassySeoul How insane is it that it took the Trump administration 15 months to name an Ambassador to South Korea? During all of this saber-rattling with the North, one of our most important embassies was left unstaffed.
Ergo, "Abolish ICE" really isn't so radical a policy as it sounds. It doesn't mean "end all enforcement of U.S. immigration law". It doesn't mean "do not deport people who have been convicted of violent crimes" - not the slightest.
Sure, immigrants rights advocates were no fans of INS - the agency under DOJ. But I do think there's good policy reason for transferring much U.S. immigration policy from Homeland Security to Justice. It really shouldn't be in the federal department devoted to counterterrorism.
Clearly, there needs to be Customs, there needs to be someone administering visas, work permits, and citizenship. But do we need the equivalent of an Army division enforcing 8 U.S. Code ¬ß 1325, "unlawful entry by an alien" - which is only a misdemeanor? 		https://t.co/UCTWBNcuJN
I can totally see a liberal Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security Committee (Kamala Harris?) introducing legislation to reorganize the immigration agencies, including but not limited to eliminating ICE- as a catalyst to remove the worst of the worst Alt Right political hires.
The Homeland Security Act in 2002, which among other things dissolved INS, distributed its powers to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), is not sacrosanct.
There's a compelling argument that the federal immigration enforcement agency, bloated by the Trump admin's plan to hire 5,000 additional ICE agents, many questionable hires with suspect motivation, will need more than just a face lift in the next Democratic administration.
However, abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency within the the Dep't of Homeland Security is actually quite feasible. An agency tainted by the worst abuses of the Trump Era will never be able to quite regain the respect it had during the Bush and Obama admins.
Often any policy prescription with the word "abolish" tends to be oversimplistic rhetoric; e.g. "abolish the IRS", "abolish the Department of Education" - with the premise that that federal function would outright cease.
I'm pretty OK with "Abolish ICE" to be the default Democratic position.

@adum23 e.g., the North Dakota AFL-CIO, the Pipefitters Union, the Teamsters are going to donate contributions to the Heitkamp campaign, partially because there are so many jobs in oil and related industries. When Heitkamp votes on energy legislation, her constituents' jobs are in mind.
@adum23 I think it's more than that. A lot of Democrats have parochial interests, and a given piece of legislation helps their state/district's constituents tremendously - while being bad for the nation as a whole. e.g., Manchin on coal, Heitkampt on oil, Iowa Dems on ethanol

@KyleOrlowicz True. I hope that one conclusion of this race is that Tinder banking is thoroughly repudiated as a campaign strategy. What a horribly invasive means of reaching voters!
Suraj Patel really couldn't wield identity politics vs. Carolyn Maloney the same way Ocasio-Cortez did vs. Crowley. Maloney, a white liberal Democrat married to an investment banker, is in fact demographically representative of her district.
Ocasio-Cortez ran a campaign based mostly on the premise that a white man can't adequately represent a district that was redrawn to include some of the most working class Latino neighborhoods in the Bronx. It worked. She ran on identity politics and won.
Maloney won in her district of the Upper East Side, Astoria, Williamsburg and Greenpoint that's 64% white and one of the wealthiest in the country. Crowley lost in his district that is now only 18% white and 50% Latino - and much more middle class to working class.
Joe Crowley and Carolyn Maloney had virtually identical voting records. Ocasio-Cortez and Suraj Patel's Berniecrat platforms were identical, their criticisms against the incumbents were identical. If that were the case, then why didn't Patel do better vs. Maloney?
I'm skeptical of the conclusion that @repjoecrowley lost because New York Democrats are hungry for a hard Left turn. Crowley lost 42 to 58 - and @CarolynBMaloney won 58 to 42. I think these different outcomes were due more to the vast demographic differences in NY-12 and NY-14. https://t.co/RMcnPGS6h5

I fear the most destructive Dem primary this year is Angelica Earl's idiotic campaign vs Claire McCaskill. Do these "progressives" not realize that Missouri is a very conservative state, and that McCaskill is perhaps the most endangered Democratic Senator in 2018?
A good case study of when NOT to primary a Dem incumbent was Bill Halter's 2010 challenge to Senator Blanche Lincoln in Arkansas. Halter forced Lincoln to fight in a costly primary AND runoff on social issues. By the general election, Lincoln had little $ left to defend her seat.
The fact that a Democrat votes sort of socially conservative does not by itself justify a primary. e.g. in the Bible Belt of Arkansas, Louisiana  Kentucky, West Virginia, the vast majority of voters are more conservative than the DNC platform. It's the only way they can win.
Among present incumbents, Dan Lipinski - who represents a liberal suburban Chicagoland district, but votes vs LGBT rights, vs reproductive rights - is perhaps the only Dem Congressman so out of step w his district that he deserves a primary. Stephen Lynch has notably evolved.
In a world in which almost 100% of Democrat incumbents are liberal on social issues, there are zero Dixiecrats, very few "Boll Weevils", I have a hard time listing very many Democrats far too conservative for their constituents. The best example was Joe Lieberman in 2006.
But merely being investigated for misconduct is not the same thing as actually having committed misconduct. Few incumbents last long without serious inquiries into campaign finances, etc. In retrospect, would have been a bad idea to primary Maxine Waters, Barney Frank.
Clearly, the standard for when a primary is justified should be less than an actual conviction. e.g. a primary challenger to Senator Robert Menendez would clearly have been justified even though he was acquitted on bribery charges. No idea why NJ Dems didnt intervene here.
A perfect example of a justified primary vs. an incumbent Dem would be the 2014 race vs. Washington  DC Mayor Vincent Gray. Gray's term was marred by 3 campaign officials pleading guilty to criminal campaign finance violations - the US Attorney all but charged Gray himself.
However, unless 1, 2, or 3 is the case, I fear that unnecessary primaries vs. Democratic incumbents weaken perfectly good liberal Democratic officeholders, deplete finite resources that could be better spent vs. GOP incumbents - and should be avoided.
Primary challenegers are justified vs. Democratic incumbents in the following scenarios:	1. Incumbent is in fact truly corrupt (e.g. Sheldon Silver)	2. Incumbent is FAR too conservative for their district or state (Joe Lieberman)	3. Incumbent can't win the general (Abe Beame)

If there is a single issue that unites Democrats in all states, across the political spectrum, it's immigration. And the bulk of independent, moderate/centrist voters, and even a lot of principled Republicans agree with us too.
If I were a reporter covering Democratic candidates for the House and Senate, I would be asking them what provisions or amendments they would add to must-pass government spending bills to end the Trump administration's horribly discriminatory, xenophobic immigration policies.
It's easier for Congress to deny funding for fed programs it opposes. I can imagine the Senate in 2019 voting on a @SenFeinstein Amendment to the DHS spending bill prohibiting separation of children from parents, or a @OrrinHatch Amendment prohibiting the Muslim Travel Ban.
There will be important movement on  health care, trade, the environment, government ethics, etc. But it's difficult for an opposition party to force the executive branch to enforce the law - let alone pass significant legislation.

There are so very few truly competitive House seats up for grabs in 2018, and by putting NY-18 at risk, he's making it significantly harder for Democrats to win a majority in the House of Representatives in 2018. A truly unforced error.
I strongly disagree with @RepSeanMaloney's decision to run for Attorney General. I respect the work he's done as Congressman, but I don't think he realizes that holding onto a House seat in NY-18 (which is+2.1% Trump) is so more important than a vanity run for statewide office.

I guarantee that if @NYGovCuomo had - instead of deferring to DOH and DEC -allowed a referendum on hydraulic fracturing of the Marcellus Shale among residents of Broome, Chemung, Chenango, Steuben, and Tioga Counties, progressives would not have been pleased with the results.
Truly, these are technical issues that I DON'T want politicians to form policy based on their gut reactions or passions of the electorate. That's what gave us such regressive drug laws and underfunded subways in NY in the first place. Experts would not have made such bad policies
Unpopular opinion: I actually like the fact that @NYGovCuomo defers to commissioners' studies to form his stances on technical policies like on hydraulic fracturing, marijuana legalization, overhauling the NYC subways, etc.

@SoapboxO NYC and NYS probably spend $5m or so/year just on the salaries of the civil servants whose job it is to make sure that affordable housing, university scholarships, etc. are apportioned equitably according to ability to pay. Far less practical for stamps, license plates, etc.
@SoapboxO If you are applying for a new affordable housing complex, or if your child is applying for a scholarship at a SUNY school, you have to submit your tax returns to prove your income. There are scores of state/city employees whose whole job is to screen applications for income.
@SoapboxO Even if you are commencing a civil action in New York courts, a plaintiff can apply to have filing fees waived. In that case, a $305 fee for an Index Number and an RJI can be a barrier to social justice. But flat usage fees for stamps, license plates, etc. are not.
@SoapboxO Taxes, housing (if you have Section 8, low income or affordable housing), health care (if you're on Medicaid), college tuition (if SUNY or CUNY), and of course TANF and SNAP are means-tested. I think it's a matter of whether it's a necessity.
@CRM0523 I'd prefer Begich run for his old Senate seat vs Dan Sullivan in 2020
Interestingly enough, I think this bill might be a much tougher sell among many Democrats - especially from Rust Belt states - where the United Steelworkers, AFL-CIO, and other labor unions really want the President to have broad authority to levy tariffs.
I applaud some of the few Senate Republicans who once in a blue moon take their jobs seriously. @SenMikeLee @BenSasse @JeffFlake @SenCoryGardner @PatToomey should be commended if they can advance the Global Trade Accountability Act to the floor. 		https://t.co/SGkxhWAWEC
I think that a lot of these tariffs are constitutionally suspect, and could give rise to a Youngstown v. Sawyer type of challenge. The President is the Commander in Chief of the Army, Navy, Marines, and Air Force - but not the civilian economy. 		https://t.co/859XTolQn2
Without any doubt, @realDonaldTrump is levying these tariffs as a part of his domestic policy agenda, to pander to white working class voters in Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania - not for national security purposes.
In these dark times, @realDonaldTrump is clearly abusing the statutory loopholes that grant the President emergency powers to levy tariffs for national security purposes. But "national security" as a reason to tax imports of steel and aluminum from NATO ally Canada is laughable.
This is largely a separation of powers issue. Tariffs are taxes, and constitutionally they are supposed to be enacted by Congress. Really the only role for the executive branch should be for the U.S. Department of Commerce to enforce tariffs enacted by Congress.
I probably disagree with @senmikelee on 95% of all things, but this bill that he introduced to curb the President's authority to levy tariffs - the Global Trade Accountability Act - is splendid.  		https://t.co/GXeVMLUFdI

@jaymart222 My hypothesis for the factual dishonesty of the "progressives" still beating the anti-IDC drum is that now that they've spent all this money registering anti-IDC 527 orgs, domain names, hired summer interns, they've invested such sunk costs that they can't afford to move on.

@CynthiaNixon I'm sorry, but this is horseshit. "Andrew Cuomo supports sexual harassers"? Puh-leez. He enacted a new law just this year requiring everyone doing business with the state to have a sufficient sexual harassment policy. If you were to read it, it's actually quite a good law.
Self-anointed "progressives" are wrong to conflate Democrats who cooperate with Republicans and Democrats who are corrupt. In cases like this, bipartisan cooperation with reform-minded Republicans is specifically TO ENACT anti-corruption legislation!
These are good anti-corruption bills. In Albany, the Senate Republican majority has often sponsored legislation to curb excesses of Democratic officials. Another reason why I disagree with the @ZephyrTeachout/@CynthiaNixon analysis of the GOP @NYSenate and the former IDC.
If one wanted to do a petty Chris Cilizza-style legislative analysis, the Senate Republican-sponsored ethics package is a WIN for Republicans, and a LOSS for Andrew Cuomo. The bills were largely drafted to respond to the Buffalo Billion scandal, which occurred on his watch.

@ashfinny Any candidates particularly promising this year? The only one I've heard of getting any traction was Ayanna Presley.
I think the problem in showing a cost-benefit analysis to California voters is that the 15% tax on all economic transactions would have to be paid NOW - the costs would be perceptible immediately - but the economic benefits would feel very intangible for decades, if not forever.
In the long run, in the aggregate, the Californians who remain could benefit from such cost savings, far fewer sick days, paid family leave days, early retirements and personal bankruptcies caused by debilitating illnesses that that money can be invested elsewhere in the economy.
Though @petertinti @jathomas to be fair, there would be a lot of purely economic, non-health benefits. A lot of firms saddled by high health benefits could find the California Plan better than what they're paying now in the private insurance market.
@jathomas lol. Are we defining all capital as "all value derived from the exploitation of the proletariat"?
@petertinti Man, what does it take to get @asacarny @ericschul to chime into a good health policy debate nowadays?
@petertinti Sadly, you're right, the American electorate rarely rewards honest discussions about tax policy. But that wonky technocratic sausage-making is of course what I'm most interested about - and puts most other people to sleep. 		https://t.co/33mqe8stYv
This is why I'm wary of progressive groups trying to make support for single payer legislation into a litmus test for Democrats. If you support single payer bills - which one? The differences between competing bills could spell out differences in $20-$200 billion of the economy.
The infinite permutations of how California captures $400 billion/y in revenue all would have enormous consequences on private sector employment. The costs could include many businesses fleeing the state, depressed salaries and wages, significantly higher unemployment.
A 15% payroll tax is one option, but California legislators could also raise $400b/y with income taxes, sales taxes, etc. But they'd be impeded by the 2017 tax law's $10,000 limitation on SALT deductions - and property taxes could require a constitutional amendment.
Enacting and enforcing a tax - or taxes - to finance a $400 billion public health insurance system is a project equivalent to California building the Eisenhower Interstate Highway System ($425 billion), or 3.3 years worth of the Veterans Administration.
Don't get me wrong, I think this would be a very good policy. But I think Democrats have to have a more serious discussion of the costs. To me the most interesting policy debate is how legislators would structure a tax to finance single payer.
The final tally would be about $400 billion a year ‚Äî more than double the state‚Äôs budget. It would require $50 billion to $100 billion in revenues from new taxes such as a 15 percent payroll tax on earned income. https://t.co/t1YRVvprwK
On Earth 2, where all your friends in Philly, Detroit, and Milwaukee had voted on 11/8/16, President @HillaryClinton just signed bipartisan immigration reform, the Senate confirmed Goodwin Liu to the Supreme Court, and you didn't waste a day thinking about Roseanne Barr's tweets.
@adum23 @350action @nychange @CynthiaNixon @NYGovCuomo Surely, the Governor of New York does not have constitutional authority to ban fracking in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, etc. The debate over fracking back in 2013 was about water pollution of the NYC watershed - not air pollution caused by burning shale gas.
In this case, it was Team #MAGA trafficking in Protocols of the Elders of Zion-like conspiracy-mongering re: Soros and the Clintons. But often it's Alt Left publications like @theintercept @TheYoungTurks who are playing these tired dog whistles. They're just as bad if not worse.

@superwuster But Hillary Clinton and Andrew Cuomo are really popular among Democrats in New York. Decisive majorities of New York Democrats, in 2000, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2014 and 2016 voted for Hillary Clinton or Andrew Cuomo in the primaries.

Thank you @lcmoser for being a class act after a contested primary. Progressive Democrats, liberal Democrats, centrist Democrats and even conservative Democrats have to work together to win back the House of Representatives in 2018. https://t.co/rnsE4PvAtH
@david_manthorp @Lizzie4Congress Why do you insist that Fletcher is a "corporate" Democrat? Her main issues are Medicaid, ACA, immigration reform, climate change, transportation and water infrastructure - a reasonably progressive platform for a Dem candidate in a GOP-held suburban district.
8. @Lizzie4Congress would be a welcome addition to the Democratic House Caucus. She would be a great legislator on health care, immigration, etc. If @OurRevolution doesn't support Lizzie Fletcher (D) vs. John Culberson (R) in November, they'll be showing their true colors.
7. In conclusion, @Lizzie4Congress is one of the Democrats' best House candidates in 2018. If Texas Democrats work together on Lizzie Fletcher's campaign, they have a chance to unseat a GOP Congressman - and perhaps claim the majority leadership in the House of Representatives.
6. @theintercept is a terrible source for objective political journalism. @ggreenwald @NomikiKonst @lhfang &amp; Co. do not publish facts, or trustworthy accounts of discernible reality. They publish slanted anti-Democratic Party jeremiads at most loosely based on some facts.
5. From henceforth, when the @OurRevolution candidate cries foul that members of the Democratic Party are playing a role in Democratic Party primaries, it means that their candidate can't pound the law, their candidate can't pound the facts, so they are just pounding the table.
4. Sometimes the Lefty-est candidate in the Democratic primary really just isn't a good candidate. Maybe @lcmoser  could put up double digits in the Democratic primary - but she would have performed so badly in the general election that #tx07 wouldn't have been competitive
Takeaway #3. Sometimes the moderately liberal-to-centrist candidate like @Lizzie4Congress wins Democratic primaries because that's what Democratic voters actually want in that jurisdiction e.g. a Republican-held House seat in the Houston suburbs. #TX07
Takeaway #2. The DCCC - whose job is recruiting and financing candidates in targeted districts - SHOULD support the most viable candidate!!!!! #TX07
Worth noting that in the Texas-7 Democratic primary, after @OurRevolution @theintercept huffed and puffed for months about the fact that the DCCC had come out in favor of @Lizzie4Congress , it turns out that @lcmoser tanked. It was never really a close race. https://t.co/JAQ2FOffvN

10. Though crime has ticked up on both NYC Subway and DC Metro in recent years, DC is still relatively safer. The older, labrynthine NYC subway stations offer criminals hiding places. DC Metro is under much tighter surveillance and is much better policed.
@CampgnLife @JimmyVielkind Eliot Spitzer, Andrew Cuomo, Zephyr Teachout.
9. DC Metro is far cooler in the summer heat than NYC Subway - mostly because the cavernous stations, deep underground dissipate heat from the subways. Also, DC Metro has superior HVAC, ventilation, chiller units and even air-conditioning in many stations. https://t.co/otKULsZA4N
8*. Closing NYC subways at 11:30 PM would be awful for nightlife patrons, servers, bussers, bartenders. But less than 1.5% of all subway rides are during 11:30 PM-5:00 AM. Clearly ending 24/7 subways to allow continuous maintenance would benefit the vast majority of commuters.
8. People may disagree with me on this one, but the fact that NYC subways operate 24/7 is a weakness rather than a strength. DC Metro is always closed from 11:30 PM to 5:00 AM on weeknights, which allows for constant maintenance and upkeep, and more reliable trains for commuters.
7. Unlike @NYCTSubway's 1930s-vintage manually-operated signals, DC Metro uses a modern Automatic Train Control signalling system which monitors subway positions in real time, and thereby allows for more trains to operate on the same line without colliding.
6. Partly because DC Metro's dynamic pricing requires riders to swipe out, it strongly discourages panhandlers, subway preachers, Showtime dancers, etc. Over 3 years of living in DC, there were less panhandlers than a single regular @NYCTSubway commute home.
5. DC Metro's dynamic pricing system is superior to @NYCTSubway's flat fares. By pricing individual rides from $1.75 to $6.50 depending on the trip between stations, it maximizes revenues and is more fair to riders. Dynamic pricing nudges riders to avoid rush hour commuting. https://t.co/ynXV14N5FD
4*. If @NYCCouncil @NYCSpeakerCoJo were to ban eating and drinking on the subway, it would cost next to nothing but putting up signs and extra garbage cans. Custodial and track cleaning costs would decrease sharply. DC commuters have just internalized the behavior change.
4. DC Metro is immaculate, litter-free, spill-free, rat-free compared to @NYCTSubway simply because eating and drinking is strictly prohibited and the rules are strictly enforced. Can't emphasize how much this improves quality of life. @NYCCouncil  @NYCSpeakerCoJo @NYCMayor
3. DC Metro's new 7000 series subway cars are superbly designed. It's bizarre in comparison how MTA seems uniquely incapable of replacing old, run-down, and malfunctioning subway cars. https://t.co/FKk3Qqitt5
2. Every station in DC Metro is ADA-accessible, whereas only 117 out of 472 are. Of course, it helps that so much of DC Metro was built far underground - requiring elevators, or after the Americans With Disabilities Act went into effect. https://t.co/wqucKRFYgt
1. Every station in the DC Metro, built from the 1970s &gt; 2010s, is wide and spacious. It's far less claustrophobic than all of NYC's 1900s&gt;1910s-vintage stations, but for the 2nd Ave Subway and the new Hudson Yards 7 Train stop.
I know Washingtonians might find this bizarre, but one of the things I miss most about this finely-planned city is your subway system. It's better than New York's in many ways:

@petertinti @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump In an election year, when red state Democrats are fighting for survival in West Virginia, North Dakota, Montana, Missouri, and Indiana, I think that their winning, and there being a Dem majority in 2021 &gt; a vote on a single Trump nominee, even one as repulsive as Haspel.
@petertinti @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump But see, Max Cleland in 2002. Sadly, I think the lesson learned from red state Democrats is that they are extremely wary of allowing even an inch of daylight on terrorism between themselves and a (in their state) popular Republican President. 		https://t.co/RAA2pHFSVl
@petertinti @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump I think that the Senators from West Virginia and North Dakota ought to vote along with the median voters in West Virginia and North Dakota. That's how you win elections. And yes, I'm more than a bit condescending to the 68% of WV'ers and 63% of ND'ans who voted Trump.
@petertinti @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump I think they made a vote which I dislike, as I strongly dislike the Senators from West Virginia and North Dakota's votes on, say, energy policy and EPA regulations. But I think that that is what a Democrat has to do to win a state where voters disagree with me on these issues.
@petertinti @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump I mean, one of my pet issues is that the U.S. should ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. But I can hardly expect any Congressman (let alone in the reddest of red states) to make a bold stand on it - I'm a constituency of dozens.
@petertinti @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Honestly, sadly, I don't think very many voters have read the Senate Torture Report, or really care about this issue like you or I. 		I think it'd be framed as "I support Trump" - which 68.5% of West Virginia voters and 63% of North Dakota voters did in 2016. https://t.co/vOF4lJEjRm

@petertinti @SenSchumer Running as the Resistance candidate isn't going to help vulnerable Democrats in states that voted 60%-70% for @realDonaldTrump.
@petertinti @SenSchumer Had all the progressive boycotters not stayed home in 2016 and voted for Russ Feingold in Wisconsin, Katie McGinty in Pennsylvania, Patrick Murphy in Florida, Jason Kander in Missouri, Schumer would have been Majority Leader, Dems could have blocked Haspel.
@petertinti @SenSchumer They're the Democrats who somehow managed to win election to statewide office from some of the most conservative states in the Union, where Trump's approval rating is 55%-60%, where the median voter thinks very differently from you or me on Iraq, Guantanamo, Abu Ghraib.
@petertinti @SenSchumer If Democrats had a majority, Chuck Schumer were Majority Leader, and they were approving even the shittiest of Trump nominees e.g. Pruitt, DeVos, Haspel, etc., I'd be singing your tune.
@petertinti @SenSchumer Democrats. have. a. minority. in. the. Senate. 		Collins, Murkowski, McCain, Flake represent much more liberal/tarian states than Manchin, Heitkamp, Donnelly, Nelson,  etc. Arguably Warner too.
Don't complain that the minority party wasn't able to block Gina Haspel's nomination to CIA Director. The only way that Democrats will be able to reject the worst Trump appointments is to elect a Democratic Senate majority and make @SenSchumer the Majority Leader.
I'll concede, #CuomosMTA is one of the issues on which I fairly criticize the Governor - and often. But if you're going to decry the underfunding of NYC subways and in the same breath demand #FairFares (which would deprive MTA of $212,000,000/y) you're missing the point.
@kkondik This is why I hope @RepSeanMaloney stays in the House. We need him on Capitol Hill - and his role will most likely be a lot more rewarding come January 2019.

Had these @OurRevolution phonies actually been around during the Progressive Era, they would have been Eugene Debs voters. They would have decried Al Smith as a "Fake Democrat" who made compromises across the aisle, and slandered Fiorello La Guardia as a "Neoliberal" sell-out.
In 1918, could you ever imagine Theodore Roosevelt or Charles Evans Hughes arguing that true Progressives must vote for the candidate for Attorney General who is the most loyal to Tammany Hall? The most partisan? Not even a member of the NY Bar?
What concerns me so much about @OurRevolution and other self-ascribed heirs to the Progressive mantle is that they now seem to believe now that loyalty to their faction within the Party, cult of personality, Socialist ideology &gt; competence in government office. Ass-backwards!
Surely, if Progressivism means anything, the Attorney General of New York must be a competent prosecutor in New York courts. That is what the NY AG does. Suggesting legislative reforms, speaking at press conferences, marching at parades are merely ancillary duties of the job.
@TonjaArcher @nypols @ZephyrTeachout My point is that the Attorney General is responsible for managing more than 650 prosecutors, and 1,700 support staff. The AG needs to understand how to practice a single case in NY courts in order to manage other prosecutors.
The Attorney General of New York is responsible for managing an office of more than 650 prosecutors, and more than 1,700 law clerks, paralegals, investigators, and support staff. NY AG is practicing law in one of the most consequential, delicate public offices in the country.
On May 14, 2018, @ZephyrTeachout is not  admitted to practice law in New York courts. That is a disqualification from prosecuting the kind of minor larceny, assault, and drug possession cases a DA's office hands to 28-year-old ADAs straight out of law school. https://t.co/EG6OQlseMi
Accordingly, I find it absolutely galling that the self-described "progressives" of the early 21st century are willing to completely excuse away @ZephyrTeachout's complete and utter lack of qualification to serve as Attorney General.
Applying such standards of meritocracy to the Democratic constituency, progressives ought to be critical of, say, the inadequate educational qualifications to become an officer in the NYPD, or President Obama's nomination of donors to cushy ambassadorships.
In the present, a liberal reformer would apply these Progressive ideals to criticize, e.g., the incumbent U.S. Secretary of Energy, who has negligible qualifications in nuclear technology, who was appointed to office to appease a GOP constituency.
The civil service angle of Progressivism was 1. to ensure that the individuals in public office were capable of performing their duties; 2. to reduce the power of urban machines which corrupted democracy through networks of make-work city employees
Back during the Gilded Age, defined by cronyism, party hacks running rather poorly the state offices which they had received as patronage, one of the Progressive Movement's primary goals was to institute civil service exams to ensure competent, professional government.
The complete and utter lack of qualifications by @CynthiaNixon and @ZephyrTeachout for the offices they seek is troubling to me, first as a New Yorker who truly cares about good government, and second, as a liberal Democrat.
@nypols @TonjaArcher @ZephyrTeachout Teachout doesn't have the bare minimum credentials to practice law in New York courts - period. "Admitted in New York (pending)" isn't enough to be an Assistant DA in Bronx County - let alone the Attorney General of New York.
@nypols @TonjaArcher @ZephyrTeachout Not really, no. Go ask a recent law school grad, admitted to the NY Bar, how hard it is to get a job as a line attorney handling DWI or personal injury cases. Attorney General is the chief prosecutor of New York State.
@mirandayaver ... to play Devil's advocate, the longer, slower, and more drawn-out this fiasco in Missouri takes place, the worse it is for AG Josh Hawley, and the better it is for one of the most vulnerable Democratic Senators, Claire McCaskill.
The only conclusion I can draw from @OurRevolution's endorsement of @CynthiaNixon is that the Bernieheads - who crapped on Hillary Clinton all of 2015-2016 for wanting to raise the minimum wage to $12 - in all honesty don't care about a $15 minimum wage. https://t.co/ZLNh4cRiKG
@nypmetro I'm OK with that.
@JRK7186 @OurRevolution @CynthiaNixon ... that's how every minimum wage increase has ever worked ever, from 1912 to present.
@todwest @tribelaw @ZephyrTeachout That's quite an underwhelming explain-away of the most basic qualification of any line prosecutor - let alone the Attorney General of New York. Maybe she should apply for a law clerk position in the interim?

@ncbostonian @OurRevolution @CynthiaNixon I understand how New York State government works reasonably well. Cuomo has been quite good at utilizing the levers of government to achieve progressive goals. 		https://t.co/y9F9IEpHy7
@JimmyVielkind @NYGovCuomo Truly, the smartest thing @NYGovCuomo to do would be to adopt legislation furthering the policies recommended by the commission's report. It would give him the cover of "responsible government", and by the way, it's the right thing to do.
@TonjaArcher @nypols @ZephyrTeachout Not one admitted to practice in New York courts! Would the Office of the Attorney General have to be admitted pro hac vice for literally every single case?
@OurRevolution @CynthiaNixon Bernie talked a big talk about raising the minimum wage $15. Governor Cuomo actually did it.
