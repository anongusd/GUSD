Indisputably, Donald Trump is an anathema. . . sorry. . . enigma to the good citizens of America. https://t.co/gvt45716lL
You are very perspicacious and descerning, unlike Donald Trump who is rash and cynical. https://t.co/Q1XIO657Vo
@DeleMomodu Verily, verily, I say unto you: "come what may, PMB will surely emerge victorious in the forthcoming presidential election slated to hold on the 16th February, 2019." 		If you know, you know! If you don't know, you don't know!
Yes, we must end this high-handedness of Trump's. https://t.co/N15JtA5b59
Donald Trump is so heartless. https://t.co/R9agDSs08q
Obviously, Donald Trump deserves to be impeached on the ground of maladministration. https://t.co/Oh3DvhtIoP
I think Donald Trump is perplexed and hapless. https://t.co/3JzzgPdYNU
I love this! https://t.co/6DxB9Nai7U
@JohnBoozman @POTUS That is rubish!
That's very asinine! https://t.co/0JlJwnSKrQ
@dlcbm1 @RepMcGovern @RashidaTlaib @realDonaldTrump Asinine!
Yes, my father. I celebrate you, Daddy. Much love to you, Sir. https://t.co/P6Ehl9SdC4
Yes, my father. I celebrate you, Daddy. https://t.co/P6Ehl9SdC4
@APOSTLESULEMAN Yes, my father. I celebrate you, Daddy. Much love to you, Sir.
The president of the United States of America is a brute. https://t.co/MgFP31FuXJ
Build which wall? Rubish! https://t.co/AgmsWGRGAv
Intelligence is relative. Likewise, dullness is relative. In life, nobody knows it all. Everybody has a specific area of gifting, or talent. Thanks for your understanding. https://t.co/xQ9hXAnGEn
Unequivocally, Donald Trump is an anathema. https://t.co/2pVurBszbl
There you go again, Mr Momodu, with your jaundiced view of PMB's propitious administration. Would I be wrong if I said you are an ardent advocate of obscurantism, gerrymandering, and jingoism? I urge you to always maintain equilibrium, not being unnecessarily sentimental. Thanks! https://t.co/wFtwO6Zd0w
Knowledge has become the Cinderella in Nigeria. Thus, I absolutely acquiesce to the salient point to which Mr Momodu just drew our attention. Thanks. https://t.co/4aX4AKgAvN
You are supposed to be an umpire, Mr Momodu. Ostensibly, you have been pitching your tent with Atiku, to the detriment of PMB's progressive and auspicious continuity. . . Thanks for your understanding! https://t.co/aSJt3Mk96o
I'm sorry to say, Mr Momodu, l think you are too partisan. . . Please try to be disinterested for once. Thanks! https://t.co/rMdGhksE7l
@DeleMomodu That's very true, Mr. Momodu.
@DohertyDeji @DeleMomodu You are talking carelessly and recklessly.
Literally, he is too perverted to be the next president of this country. https://t.co/hUHu1yFILD
@APOSTLESULEMAN We love you, Apostle!
Dr. Ford should be ashamed of herself... 	Why did she wait till this critical moment of Kavanaugh's life?	Must she ruin his career and reputation? 	Whether the democrats like it or not, Judge Brett Kavanaugh must be the Justice of the Supreme Court, because he is a great man. https://t.co/amU2VjoOQz
Why are you ranting, Mr Seconds? Do you think you can usurp, or depose, PMB by your grandiloquence? You can ask Adeleke to acquiant you with the consequences of his rhodomontade before and during the just-concluded Osun State gubernatorial election... https://t.co/IGmkaancCU https://t.co/yF9vFy9TDx
@SenToddYoung He is absolutely qualified...
@billymashala You are right.
"ICT experts decries..." 		I think the editor of The Guardian should be more pedantic... https://t.co/QtAktNAeeK

@MichaelsOgoo @Aremu1986 @Hargbo1 @APCNigeria @OfficialAPCNg Did you just say both "has" check mark?
@Meandy23 @APOSTLESULEMAN Was my pastor the one who stole your money?  		What has my pastor got to do with your stolen money? 		Or are trying to beg him for money on Twitter? 		That is immature and improper. 		I think there is a better way to ask for assistance.
@JohnCMaxwell You are right, Sir.
@JohnCMaxwell Very true, Sir.
@davmesco @PObahiagbon Leave him alone and speak your own. Critics like you are suffering from the pathology of low self-esteem.
@JohnCMaxwell Very true, Sir.
@JohnCMaxwell I acquiesce, Sir.
@APOSTLESULEMAN Yes, Sir. 	The Gospel (of Christ) must be heard.
@JohnCMaxwell "It takes greater courage to fail than to succeed."
@JohnCMaxwell I absolutely agree with you, Sir.
@Twitter Twitter is the best social network medium in the world, unarguably.
@nvwole @inecnigeria You shouldn't tell people to remove the twigs in their eyes when you haven't removed the log in your eye.  		Please, I urge you to spare 1minute to look-up and study the use of the word "broadcast" (verb). 		Please, pay close attention to its past tense and past participle.
@inecnigeria I think INEC is confused.
@APOSTLESULEMAN That's very correct, Sir.
@JohnMaxwellTeam That's true, Sir.
@JohnCMaxwell Very correct!
You are absolutely correct. https://t.co/rWOVZvHrA0
Keep accelerating, Mr P. https://t.co/h1wVpP1jJ3

@dapsey20 @Miss_Tofunmi @JusJaeDee Who is this nitwit?
@beejaynotbj @Miss_Tofunmi Undoubtedly, you are a quintessential example of the lazy Nigerian youths that President M.B. talks about.
@JusJaeDee @Miss_Tofunmi If Don Jazzy were a Twitter beggar like you, he would not be celebrated nationwide. So get up, take the risk, and join the millionaires!
@missdzeneaphar @ilesanmi_dun @DONJAZZY Lass, I think you and your indolent cohorts should become more creative and productive and start helping others, instead of sheepishly converting yourselves to piteous loafers on Twitter.
Thanks, dear. https://t.co/cZbNITtZ1u
@Miss_Tofunmi Obviously, you must be a mendicant.
@Mafe_Lade @missdzeneaphar @ilesanmi_dun @DONJAZZY All right!
@sahon_A I sympathize with you, dear consummate ignoramus.
@iam_mystiquee Do you have to solicit...in public?
@Miss_Tofunmi Must you exhibit your innate beggary on Twitter?
@Mie_Baka Who told you that the wrist watches belongs to John Cena?
@missdzeneaphar @Ejiskid5 @ilesanmi_dun @DONJAZZY You hope who can't see what? Could you expatiate, please!
@Mafe_Lade @missdzeneaphar @ilesanmi_dun @DONJAZZY Like how?
@missdzeneaphar @ilesanmi_dun @DONJAZZY No offence intended. No jibes, please.
@ilesanmi_dun @DONJAZZY This is really funny! So some people have turned Twitter into a platform of disguised beggars.
Yes, of course. https://t.co/jMbMbvdcmZ
