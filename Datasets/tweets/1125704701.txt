@PamKeithFL an outside detective agency?  That cost you how much?   All you had to do is watch the tape provided by the Black Preachers this whole thing centered around and you would of seen what happened.   Those kids were punks.    Thats not illegal.  But, it should be disciplined for sure

But,l if they dont, we HAVE to rally around whoever does.  We cant survive conservatives winning any more.  If they win we ALL lose.
@samgladstone661 @JesusWasARebel2 @PoliticsDen maybe if you ran someone dems could support, you'd win the nomination.  You keep proving you cant think your way out of a paper bag.

@Jimmymack010 @helena_jennie Oh Jeez........like talking to a door nob.  See ya
@Jimmymack010 @helena_jennie I am NOT the enemy here.  Dems are NOT your enemy.  Trump and EVERY conservative in EVERY office, is !! And THAT has to be your and mine and everyone here's focus !!  Getting them ALL out of office and getting OUR agenda in !! Whether its Bernie or anyone else is all I care about
@Jimmymack010 @helena_jennie They ALL have their problems.  And Bernie may not be MY top pick.  But, if Bernie wins the nomination, i flat out PROMISE you I will FULLY support him in every way I can to help him win  Because its about the AGENDA and the thought of Trump and conservatives winning makes me puke
@Jimmymack010 @helena_jennie I havent said shit about Bernie.  Its his bots that are the problem. In fact I complimented Bernie last time I spoke about him.  He moved the needle on medicaid for all and $15/hr min wage past where HRC  and most dems were.  he deserves credit for that.  But, he has his problems
@Jimmymack010 @helena_jennie No.  its YOUR selfish snob thinking why we are here today.   In 2008, I supported HRC.  Obama won.  I went to work getting Obama elected.  The thought of a republican winning was not acceptable.  Obama was a good candidate but it was his agenda I wanted to win.  And congress.
@GrassrootsSpeak @lavenderblue27 it got him the chairmanship of the judiciary.....wonder what else he's after?
@Jimmymack010 @helena_jennie Yes...its the lesser of 2 evils approach.  But, its the ONLY approach that will work.  The primaries are open hunting season.  Pick one and go for it.  But, once one is picked, then thats that.  You will NEVER see anything you want if trump wins.  Focus on THAT.  THAT is our goal
@Jimmymack010 @helena_jennie We can not get what we want if we dont have power.  And we can not get power if we dont win elections.  And we can not win elections if we dont all pull TOGETHER.  There are NO perfect candidates. Not even bernie.  They ALL have their flaws.  You have to win to change anything
@Jimmymack010 @helena_jennie I will support the Dem nominee because it will get a more progressive AGENDA that helps us all and the country.I dont care if its bernie or karmala or joe or whoever.  I dont care WHO wins the nomination I care who wins the general !!!  If Bernie wins, then he will get my support
@Jimmymack010 @helena_jennie Its NOT about party!!! FUCK the party.   Why cant ANY of you get that thru your thick fucking heads???   Its about US....Its about agendas.... Trump is scum.  We all know that.  But, he is the VEHICLE for the conservative agenda.  That agenda hurts us ALL and hurts the COUNTRY!!!
@Jimmymack010 @helena_jennie so what? we are in January of 2019.; Over a year from the primaries.   Worry about YOUR candidate.  I didnt attack Bernie or any of the others.  I want to see who all gets into the race....hear what they have to say.....and decide for MYSELF what is what.  Not bash Bernie all day
@EricTerman @Jimmymack010 @helena_jennie Problem with Bernie Bots as we see and Trump lovers is they arent politically astute about shit.  They are in love with their guy thats it.  Thats your right.  But, stop with all the extracurricular bullshit you have proven you know nothing about;.  All you do is cry boo hoo
@helena_jennie @Jimmymack010 all you assclowns have done is cry like babies since july of 2016 and you still are and here we are STILL fussing over it all because YOU decided to attack Harris like a 2yr old instead of focusing on YOUR candidate and WINNING 2020 !! If you detract from that goal you are fucked
@helena_jennie @Jimmymack010 The saints got as robbed as robbed gets in that playoff game with philly.  totally screwed on that missed call.   Now, they can spend the rest of their lives crying over that, or they can work hard, get the rules changed and come back focused on working hard and winning next year
@Jimmymack010 @helena_jennie look in the mirror dude.  your selfish ignorance screwed us all.  Glad youre happy with Trump.  Anyone that thinks that way is a total fucking idiot !!!!  No different than trump lovers.  cant see past their nose.  and dont want to.  spoiled brats.  dont get your way cry wahhhh
@SteeOne @helena_jennie break it down into them verses us.   Their agenda will do everything that is 100% opposite of what we want.  They pick judges, pass laws, make policies. etc.  Is that acceptable?  If WE win, then we can do all of that.  Does that work?  We may not get it all, but its alot better
@Jimmymack010 @EricTerman @helena_jennie why cant you?  who said?  why not?   Get INVOLVED in the process !!!  THAT is how you change it.   Not by crying over it later.  It will NEVER change unless WE change it.  Look at all the progressives and women than won last November.  THAT is how we change things.  Win elections

@helena_jennie @EricTerman @Jimmymack010 Please grow a brain.    Im ALL FOR wiping out the EC.  It IS a rigged game.  No question.  And parties.  And conventions and all of this crap.  We should ALL be Indys and get the big money out of it.  Ive said that for 50yrs.   Each state decides its rules.  Conservatives fuck us
@EricTerman @helena_jennie @Jimmymack010 HRC wasnt chosen in advance, obviously.   But, she was the favorite, obviously.   Bernie was the late comer and nobody expected him to do as well as he did.  It might of been assumed she would win, but she still had to run and people had their chance to choose.  And she won
@EricTerman @helena_jennie @Jimmymack010 Get on the board of the DNC and CHANGE the rules you want changed.  Dont cry about them after the fact.
@EricTerman @helena_jennie @Jimmymack010 Each State has the right to make up its own rules concerning primaries and so forth.  Example. NY said you HAD to register as either a D or an R.  Bernie and supporters didnt bother to find out in advance and got burned trying to register as Indys and couldnt vote.  Thats on THEM
@EricTerman @helena_jennie @Jimmymack010 Yes. The DNC and RNC are organizations and they have the right to make the rules that governs them.  They do so long in advance.   The problem was Bernie and his supporters did not bother to educate themselves with those rules and got burned by them a couple of times.  NOT rigged
@Jimmymack010 @helena_jennie And Hillary got shafted by Russia Comey Bernie Bots....STOP YOUR FUCKING CRYING WAHHH...NOBODY FUCKING CARES ANY MORE !!!  2016 is OVER.....Get your fucking heads in the game.....2020 is ALL that matters !!!  Deal with THAT and stop crying over 2016.  Grow the fuck up already.
@SteeOne @helena_jennie Valid points.  Your choices are....run a candidate you like and get everyone to vote for them....vote for whomever wins the nomination because they are better than the alternative....dont vote and spend years crying over it all ....To change anything you have to have power first!
@LouDobbs @gatewaypundit @EdRollins @realDonaldTrump he didnt get it becuase NOBODY WANTS IT !!!!! except idiots
@RealJamesWoods coming from trump and conservatives i agree
@helena_jennie @Jimmymack010 stop crying about 2016!!!!!!  Its NOT helping your cause.  This is NOW.   A whole NEW ball game.  Either play, or take your ball and go home.   We dont have time for this shit.   LEARN THE RULES and you'll be alot better off.
@helena_jennie @Jimmymack010 stop attacking Kamela and whoever else.  SHOW us WHY we should be supporting YOUR candidate.  If Bernie runs, we know all about Bernie.  Try doing some research of your own.  If he wins the nomination he will get our full support.  But if he dont, then whomever does will. Join us
@helena_jennie @Jimmymack010 You are only proving my point.  A) you dont have a clue.  B) you dont have a nominee  C) youre no different than trumps cult.  Bernies cult is no different than trumps cult.  No oxygen ever gets above the shoulders. LEARN THE RULES...MAKE THE RULES  DONT CRY ABOUT THE RULES AFTER
@RealJamesWoods he is not a liberal.  he is a never trump republican.
@Liz_Cheney You only care about babies when they are still sperm and egg cells.  After they are born, you dont give a flying fuck about them. You starve them imprison them enslave them and spit on them every chance you get. You wont even feed them let alone educate them. You send them to war

@helena_jennie then youre just an ass. just go vote for trump and be done with it.  that would be the most HONEST thing you could do.  Because all this other bullshit is fucking crybaby shit. Put up a candidate you WANT and support them. If THEY win the nomination they will get our FULL support
@helena_jennie you guys really need to grow the fuck up.   save all your horseshit for your friends.  If you guys go that route again then we will lose again. Just like last time.  And be fucked . if you can actually see the bigger picture and support the nominee then we ALL win...including YOU
@toddcallison @helena_jennie only if you are assholes again and do what you did in 2016.   instead of insulting everyone put up a candidate you like and go for it.  If they win the nomination we will rally behind that person to win it all.  But that goes for whoever wins.  Whoever it is is better than trump

@helena_jennie No it wasnt.   YOU guys crashed a party you had no idea about.  You didnt know and didnt care.  Every election has rules, like it or not.  And you guys constantly missed out because of that.  Like thinking you could register as indys when you could only register D or R in NY. etc
@helena_jennie Your priorities are fucked!!!!  You should have ONE goal.  The SAME goal we ALL have.   BEAT TRUMP and conservatives everywhere!!!!  Support the candidate you like.  Run yourself even.  But,. once a nominee is chosen, that is where all of our energy MUST go or we are fucked again
@helena_jennie Your brain is frozen.  You cant change anything unless you have the power to do so.  And you get the power by winning elections.  And you win elections by getting on board and working TOGETHER.  Once a nominee is chosen, thats it.  Stop crying over 2016.  Focus on winning NOW
@helena_jennie evolution revolution gun control sound of soul shooting rockets to the moon kids growing up too soon and politicians say mo' taxes will solve everything...and the band played on. Get off your high horse and get into the real game.  This is a marathon not a sprint. Think long term
@helena_jennie bernie bots are the problem not the solution.  And you are proving why. Not a single functioning brain cell.  You are NO DIFFERENT than the Trump cult that is why its hard to distinguish between the 2 ignorances.  Run whomever you want in the primaries but we need to unite to win
@helena_jennie I understand what youre saying.....politicians will act in accordance to their biggest donors requests.  I get that.  Im all for money out of politics.  But, YOU have got to understand that wont ever happen until we have full control of the congress and WH no matter who vote blue

@fleetadmiralj @MiltShook The fact he has RUN a government and UNDERSTANDS and APPRECIATES what government is for and about is a big point in his favor.  Obama was a state senator then a US Senator.

Provoked might be too strong.  But goaded isnt.  THEY made the decision to come down those steps and confront the 2 Black preachers.

@ZerlinaMaxwell The irony was that it was the NAs that marched in to save the Black Preachers from the MAGA kids after the preachers had been taunting the NAs  at first.  The NAs ignored them, the MAGA kids didnt.  They made a wrong choice to confront instead of ignore   https://t.co/ZkzVCjDYfB

@JackPosobiec @gatewaypundit they didnt start it.  They were provoked.  But, they could of easily walked away. Instead they CHOSE to come down those stairs and start mocking and taunting and it could of become a very ugly scene.  mr. phillips group interceded and stopped it.  But, those kids acted like punks
@ZerlinaMaxwell Zerlina. please watch this video.......https://t.co/ZkzVCjDYfB  it shows the ENTIRE event from start to finish.  Its long.  But, it puts it all into context.  Mr. Phillips group actually interceded and saved what could of been a very ugly situation.  The MAGA kids reacted wrongly

@EmeraldRobinson @gatewaypundit @JamesFallows @DanRather @benshapiro @RichLowry @BillKristol @nytdavidbrooks @jaketapper @maggieNYT @secupp @ananavarro The Covington kids ARE to blame for what happened.  They didnt necessarily provoke it, but they sure as shit made the decision to come down those steps and start ridiculing and mocking and intimidating the black preachers and then Mr Phillips and his group when they intervened
@JackPosobiec @gatewaypundit 6) the kids began to disperse to their bus but some hung back and actually got into discussions with the 2 preachers over religion and politics.   It was an ugly scene that could of turned very ugly if violence had broke out.  Mr. Phillips and his group helped prevent that.
@JackPosobiec @gatewaypundit 4) all Phillips was doing was chanting his chant and banging his drum.  He never said a word to the kids. MAGA hat kid was a fresh punk that didnt say it out loud but took the obvious stance of "I dare you to walk thru me''.  Mr Phillips didnt oblige.  It was a punk move by punks
@JackPosobiec @gatewaypundit 3) Thats when Phillips and his group came marching in between the 2 sides chanting and banging their drum. He turned towards the kids and backed them up about 10yds away from the preachers who saw it as a rescue and were thankful and kids then turned their attention onto the NAs
@JackPosobiec @gatewaypundit 2) like the NAs did while they were doing their ceremony.   But instead, they CHOSE to come down the steps and start taunting and mocking the black preachers who were in turn yelling back at them about religion and politics.   Well over 100 kids and 2 or 3 black guys getting ugly
@JackPosobiec @gatewaypundit HES FUCKING LYING YOU FUCKING MORON !!!!!  Find out the REAL story !!!!.     2 black preachers were taunting everyone there to repent and dogging them.   They were yelling at the NAs first then the MAGA hat kids.   The kids were at the top of the stair and could of ignored them

@CassandraRules The kids had a choice to keep moving or stop and come down the steps and start shouting and mocking and they chose the latter.  Mr Phillips group interceded to save the black preachers who had provoked the situation. It was a noble gesture. Then the kids turned on his group.
@HuffPost He‚Äôs lying.the full tape shows the black preachers yelling at the NAs then the kids who came all the way down the steps towards the preachers yelling and mocking them.Phillips group marched in between the two and backed the kids away from the preachers while the kids mocked them

3/... no question the black guys initiated it all by yelling preaching but the kids definately fed off of it and turned into punks when they could of ignored it like the NAs but chose to be confrontational.  Mr Phillips was actually playing peacemaker coming between the 2 groups
2/.... black guys are not Muslims... but they are radicalized ..they do use racial slurs..they preach from bible eventually get into long discussion with kids about Catholicism and so on... kids were being punks but the is right the black guys were yelling at them and the NAs too
Ok the full video is out... black guys yelling gospel at NA... kids start gathering and yelling eventually they‚Äôre all around then Mr Phillips marches in between to buffer kids from black guys and kids surround them and mock them eventually kids leave.... https://t.co/n5ZaHhqnhT

@LEBassett why do you think trump has been pushing this issue and even went on tv last night?  To distract from all of that.  I dont know how he has advance warnings on this stuff but he does.   And he finds a way to change the subject as fast as he possibly can
You're wrong again Bill.  Most Trump lovers would support a wall.  If MEXICO pays for it.  But, only 25% of the country is ok with US paying for some stupid wall.  That money could much be better spent on agents and the like and also to take care of the homeless Vets and so forth https://t.co/nhofa3wk8u

@TroyPittman1 @CamEdwards ok man.  I appreciate the discussion.   Thank you.   Have a great day
@TroyPittman1 @CamEdwards Im not using this as a political football. Its an issue that can be easily dealt with. Like I say. It could and should of been dealt with 15 yrs ago.  Its NOT worth forcing 800k people to go without pay and turn our national parks into waste dumps thats for sure.  Trump is insane
@TroyPittman1 @CamEdwards that we can agree on.  But the 'path to citizenship' would allow those people to do just that. And it would take twice as long and cost twice as much than if they came here legally and they pay a hefty fine and back taxes. THAT is punishment enough.   They become legal no amnesty
@TroyPittman1 @CamEdwards 9/11 changed everything.  Before, illegals got a nod and a wink unless they got into trouble because they worked the fields etc.  After, the Dems brought up the border security issue, cons still defended them.  But, it became such a huge issue with the public, cons jumped on it
@TroyPittman1 @CamEdwards Youre projecting.  And yes, we agree to disagree.  We can STILL have border security without a wall.  Stop seeing everything in only black or white, either/or, terms.  There is a ton of room to reach a consensus here without either side breaking a sweat.  IF conservatives want to
@TroyPittman1 @CamEdwards This ALL could of been resolved with McCain/Kennedy or in 2011 with Obamas bill.  I get conservatives hated how reagan handled the issue. But there is a point where its pretty obvious they want no part of resolving this issue.  The border will NEVER be secure enough for them EVER
@TroyPittman1 @CamEdwards Im against ICE rounding up people that have lived here 30yrs raised a family here and have been productive as any natural born citizen.  Im against deporting kids that have served in our military. Im against conservatives using this issue for political purposes instead of a fix
@TroyPittman1 @CamEdwards You cant see anything other than trump says.....I have NEVER said im ok with people coming here illegally.  I said im against WASTING 25b over a stupid wall !!!  Im against seperating kids from parents and putting them in camps... im against kids not getting proper care and dying
@GeoffRBennett Im getting scared for this president.  He is talking himself into an assassination.   Probably by someone close to him like a SS agent.  Not predicting, just saying
