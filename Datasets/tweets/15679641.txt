4/ It was after more than 10 years of being trafficked and 13 months in prison that Charleston made her escape back to North Texas.		She soon found herself at @gatewaypeople and eventually joined @valianthearts, a group that helps those who have experienced sexual exploitation.
3/ Charleston had become one of what the University of Texas in 2016 estimated to be 76,000 minor and youth victims of sex trafficking in Texas. And, like the majority of women in prostitution, she did not seek it out or choose it - and she was desperate to leave it.
2/ Charleston soon found herself in a car on Harry Hines being told exactly how to ask people if they wanted to have sex and how much she had to charge them.		‚ÄúIt was like my entire world flipped upside down on top of me. I had no idea what to do.‚Äù https://t.co/0eMxrzFbpd
1/ Rebekah Charleston was 17 when she ran away from Keller and began working at a strip club. There, she met a guy who told her his dreams and said he'd take care of her.		She then found out his dreams would cost her in the form of her body.	https://t.co/0eMxrzFbpd
