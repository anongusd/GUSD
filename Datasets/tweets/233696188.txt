Read Ranking Member Stabenow's full opening statement at the #SenateAg hearing on #FarmBill implementation: https://t.co/4j9CzyXgW2 https://t.co/4Tnb0wT6qO
Stabenow: I also have questions about the USDA‚Äôs capacity to implement the #FarmBill. Without sufficient staff in local offices, the bill‚Äôs improvements won‚Äôt reach the very people they were designed to support.
Stabenow raises concern over the Administration‚Äôs #SNAP rule: ‚ÄúThis partisan rule makes changes to SNAP that were rejected by Congress and would take food assistance away from Americans struggling to find steady work.‚Äù
Stabenow: The #FarmBill dramatically improved the dairy safety net to help dairy farmers weather the instability they have faced for too long. https://t.co/eLuQH8FOZo
Stabenow: We also expanded access to risk management tools like crop insurance to ensure that all farmers can protect their livelihoods. #FarmBill https://t.co/YOgbuvOwU4
Stabenow: We made strong investments in rural America, including expanding high-speed internet and re-establishing the Under Secretary for Rural Development. #FarmBill https://t.co/3TRdtmcq7v
Stabenow: The #FarmBill enhanced tools that help farmers preserve our land, improve water quality, and support climate-smart agriculture. https://t.co/q6rah4gDOF
Stabenow: We established an Office of Urban Agriculture and provided historic new tools for urban farmers that are bringing jobs and fresh food into local communities. #FarmBill https://t.co/MJW9ZQjo8a
Stabenow: Despite facing a challenging budget, we secured permanent funding in the #FarmBill for:	üå±Organic research	üç¥Local food systems	‚õ¥Export promotion 	üë©‚ÄçüåæNew and beginning farmers 	ü•ïNutrition incentives
Stabenow: In Michigan, the strength of our agricultural economy is rooted in our diversity. The 2018 #FarmBill celebrates that diversity and creates new opportunities for farmers and families.
Stabenow: By the end of last year, we passed a strong, historic #FarmBill with the support of 87 Senators and 369 House members. Now, our farmers, families, and rural communities are counting on the USDA to implement it quickly and effectively.

Read the rule and weigh in with the Administration here: https://t.co/H6xSaXdaGL
Instead of bypassing Congress to make ideological changes that will harm those in need, the Administration should focus on implementing the #FarmBill‚Äôs bipartisan job training provisions that actually help families find good paying jobs.
In the #FarmBill, Congress chose NOT to make any harmful changes to nutrition assistance because these provisions make hunger worse and do nothing to help Americans get ahead.
The rule restricts states‚Äô long-standing ability to respond to unemployment and economic hardship in their own communities, jeopardizing food assistance for families while they are struggling to find steady work.
The same day the bipartisan #FarmBill became law, the Trump Administration announced a proposed #SNAP waiver rule that ignores the intent of Congress and takes food away from families. Today through April 2, the rule is open for public comment.

Stabenow: Nearly 70% of those on SNAP are seniors, children, or people with disabilities. It is unconscionable to risk letting those most in need go hungry.
Stabenow: Because of the shutdown: Farmers can‚Äôt apply for loans because local offices are closed. Rural homeowners can‚Äôt receive the rural housing loans they need to finance their homes.
Stabenow: Every day that USDA is shut down is another day the improvements in the 2018 #FarmBill are delayed.
Stabenow: Last year, we passed a bipartisan #FarmBill to help farmers struggling with low prices, trade concerns, and unpredictable weather. However, the President has undermined the certainty that the Farm Bill provided by continuing this shutdown.

Stabenow: We know there are important differences between our two bills. One thing we all agree on is the urgent need to pass a five year Farm Bill. #FarmBill18
Stabenow: We need to focus on ways to create jobs in rural communities by making investments in clean energy and biobased manufacturing. #FarmBill18
Stabenow: Conservation tools help our farmers keep their farmland productive while also protecting our land and water. We should not target these important resources for cuts.
Stabenow: We need to invest in the future of agriculture by providing permanent investments to support for beginning farmers, strengthen organic research, and grow both local food systems and trade promotion.
Stabenow: The Senate #FarmBill18 supports the wide variety of farms all across America. The strength of our agriculture economy is rooted in the diversity of what we grow.
SNAP is working and costs are going down. The Congressional Budget Office has said food assistance is saving $80 billion more than initially expected. #FarmBill18
Stabenow: Our farmers and agricultural businesses need the certainty of a five-year Farm Bill. We can give them the certainty they need if we work together. #FarmBill18
Stabenow to @SenPatRoberts: Thanks to your leadership, the Senate passed a historic Farm Bill on a 86-11 vote. I was proud to be your partner in that important effort. #FarmBill18

Stabenow: It is critical that we never return to the risky behaviors that caused the Great Recession. The CFTC must continue its progress to complete the rulemakings under Dodd-Frank.
Stabenow to CFTC nominee Berkovitz: Farmers, manufacturers, and consumers rely on our futures and swaps markets to provide stability and certainty. The CFTC plays a critical role to keep these markets free of fraud and abusive practices.
Stabenow to Hubbard: Very importantly, we need strong leadership to reverse the culture of sexual misconduct that has plagued the Forest Service for decades.
Stabenow: The Forest Service also manages land for hunting, fishing, and wilderness preservation, which supports thousands of jobs in the outdoor recreation industry.
Stabenow: While there‚Äôs no silver bullet to stopping modern-day megafires, the Forest Service must do everything it can to protect lives during wildfires.
Stabenow to Hubbard, who would oversee the @forestservice if confirmed: ‚ÄúAs we once again face a challenging wildfire season, we need strong leadership now more than ever.‚Äù
