@MaVASteve Ah!  LOL.  Because the former GOP Gov of California was George Deukmejian!   I do that a lot.  LOL
@MaVASteve what did I say?
Pro-choice, women’s health, reproductive choice are all terms of art accomplishing a well thought-out and market-tested political spin operation. Gov. Gosnell has shown us exactly what those euphemisms really mean. - https://t.co/R7o5BI4Wpd - @washtimes
A bill allowing abortion after 24 weeks was signed into law in NY last week and was celebrated as a breakthrough on behalf of ensuring a woman’s “reproductive health.” Gov. Gosnell painted a vivid picture of what “reproductive health” really looks like. - https://t.co/R7o5BI4Wpd
The abortion debate is not a libertarian, civil rights discussion over a woman’s right to make medical decisions about her body.Nor has it ever been.Thank you, Gov. Gosnell.  - https://t.co/R7o5BI4Wpd

@LeslieMarshall If social media responses are the measuring stick then I guess we can discuss the left's depiction of gun owners and white Southern men.  		 I would hope we are both past that sort of thing. We are talking about the congressman's statement which you referred to as islamophobia.
@LeslieMarshall Some would say? Would you? 		I don't think anyone is saying those views don't have a right at the table I think the commentary here is how far the Democratic party has gone in abandoning their support for Israel.		In fact, that is exactly what the GOP Congressman was saying
Why did you assume the comment was based on her faith?
I think they are referring to her extreme views and positions. You read the article right? 		Generally, Republicans don't categorize a person based on their faith or race but on their views and principles... the content of their character if you will. https://t.co/pV0DBaGv3x

Why was little Jazmine's murder only considered newsworthy and a "cause" when it was believed race was involved? 		Will the athletes and celebrities and journalists still be there for her grieving family now that they cant use her murder to divide our country along racial lines?
Now that the suspect has been arrested and has allegedly confessed to the murder, isnt it fair to ask why more attention isnt paid to the sad reality that the murder of an innocent African-American in this country is all too commonly the result of the scenario we see here?
Would all of the athletes and celebrities and journalists have spent as much time and energy on the murder of this poor little girl if the original reports had not suggested this was a racially motivated crime perpetrated by a while man? https://t.co/QHCeOx3ool

@pga_to @hughhewitt Sir, I don't know what to tell you. You begin by telling Hugh that you oppose the "silly wall," and then three statements later you said you supported a wall in some places. I really don't know what we're accomplishing at this point. 		Hoping to move on now.  Ok?
@pga_to Yes. And I asure you,  no one is advocating for a wall where it is physically impossible. 		I also assure you that those who oppose a wall do not just oppose it where its physically impossible. They oppose it everywhere.  		@hughhewitt's original statement stands.  		Good evening
@pga_to Why do you presume to know better than them?
@pga_to When a person ignores a question and asks a new question in response. It tells me something. 		Drones dont prevent illegal crossings. They observe them from afar.		I defer to the border patrol on this. I think they know best. 		They want a large, steel and/or concrete barrier.
@pga_to So, you dont have an answer.  		Ok.
@pga_to Hiw do you prevent a person from illegally crossing a border with a drone and a court?
@pga_to So.... yeah.  Ok.  Border security.  Protecting the border.  Preventing a person from crossing the border illegally....   how do you accomplish that without a wall? That's the question.  		If you cant answer it, then by definition, you dont want border security.

Some career news...		https://t.co/uRtHce8Zsu
@ThatElJefe So? It's not true. It's fake.
"While some conservatives tried to use the video to portray..." Where are these conservatives? 		In fact when you click on the Twitter write-up you only see tweets of people pushing back against these imaginary conservatives. Youd think Twitter would include the offending tweets.
And heres how Twitter presented the story... https://t.co/fztA1NUWfd
So back to my request... Can you please send me links to tweets or articles or screenshots of conservatives mocking or criticizing vest? I'd really appreciate it.
In fact, most of what I've seen from conservatives on my timeline is quite the opposite. They think it's cute and fun in the reflections of a teenager enjoying life not of a congresswoman character.
Honest request... 	I promise I'm not being disingenuous here. I keep hearing the conservatives were criticizing AOC for the video of her doing The Breakfast Club Dance. I have a lot of conservatives in my timeline and I have literally seen no one criticizing her.

In other words, how many news outlets are actually delivering NEWS and information to you rather than just affirming their own political biases and Reporting on this like it's some sort of football game?
Furthermore, how many news outlets have explained exactly what part of the federal government is affected by the 25% that may go unfunded temporarily while this current political Showdown unfolds?
How many news outlets have also explained that 75% of the government is unaffected by this current political Showdown because the republican-led House and Senate have already funded 3/4 of the federal government?
How many news outlets have explained to you that the so-called government shutdown would only involve 25% of the federal government?

The anonymous-sourced reports suggesting ownership sabotaged their own publication over political differences fly in the face of logic and my own personal observations. 		This is mean-spirited spin and is beneath the legacy of this stalwart brand and the principals who founded it
My experience (although it was sadly too brief) was that ownership wanted nothing more than to see their magazine and website succeed.
I worked at Weekly Standard for the first 12 weeks of 2017 as their online editor. I had big plans to help bolster their web presence and traffic. I still regret it didn't work out. It was too bad we didn't see eye-to-eye on things.		Also...
Also... and more importantly....  @dcexaminer!
Fact:  When @TaisjeC and I start pitching guests to each other for our @WMALDC radio show, some of the top names we come up with every day have bylines at @washexaminer. 		They have a great group of writers who do terrific work.  Their expansion plans are impressive.		Carry on.
