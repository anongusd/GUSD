@jakebarrett78 @mistergizmo @DavidCornDC Congress wrote the law for American s that lobby for forgiven countries. You only have to register if your caught doing it and then you can backdate the paper work so you are not charged with a felony only a civil fine which the forgiven govt pays for.
@jakebarrett78 @mistergizmo @DavidCornDC Congress writes the campaign Finance laws so that it benefits them. Congress get tax money for their campaigns. Congress allows forgiven influence by allowing forgiven companies and countries to donate money to 3rd party organizations for campaigns.
@jakebarrett78 @mistergizmo @DavidCornDC Congress has set up the ethics committee that investigates violations of law by Congress to be a swampy where complaints go to die. Congress will put up with felony crimes by other Congressmen instead of expelling them.
@jakebarrett78 @mistergizmo @DavidCornDC Congress has their own gym on tax payers money, Congress has their own special health insurance, special retirement plan, has their own special cafeteria paid for by taxpayers. Special barbers and hairstylist paid by tax dollars. Special limo service paid by tax money
@jakebarrett78 @mistergizmo @DavidCornDC Congress is allowed to keep campaign donations as personal money that is left over.

@GOP  I do not want to be thanked for my service, all i want is to know that what I did for many years was for the Country as a whole. Time for GOP and DEms to start thinking about the greater good instead of their petty lives.
Time to revamp the Civil Service. This is not a place for politics to be involved at all while working for the best intrests of the country. Get out the Dems and GOPs in the civil service that put politics over country.
@GOP Insiders of the DNC are already palnning the impeachment process for both Donald Trump and Mike Pence.
@BLMLA That $139 billion spent each year on illegal immgriants should be spent on poor black American familys for job training schools, housing, food, and health care for children.
@NFL   Rumour is that the players in the NFL in order to support social Justice and to support the working poor will donate all of their paychecks each month to the poor working class of the cities where they work!
@freedomcaucus amend the current law to prevent Congressmen from doing insider trading! Require that no Congressman have any influence on where public money is spent or directed to.
@freedom caucus, please introduce a bill to be passed by Congress that is simple an easy to understand, Lobbyists, Corporations, Companies and individuals will no longer be allowed to donate to any Elections campaign or business associated with a Congressman.
@FBI @FBIAgentsAssoc Director Wray, and former agents, now is the time to save the FBI by coming forth with all documents revelant to the special investigation of Donal Trumps campaign, the Hillary Clinton fiasco. Save the FBI by being transparent! Do not hide any longer.

@WashNewsLine Why not tell the whole story over 30 Democratic senators had ahem private meetings with her!
@WashNewsLine Is this real news? Nope this never happened it was edited together without either Shep or Sean debating each other.
@Mikeymgm1701 @CyrusMMcQueen Really? That is supposed to be some type of evidence! Gee logical thinking is no longer taught in schools.
@AlphaSomega2012 Show me your empiracial evidence for such a fool hardy statement!
@kwilli1046 @mobileal2017 Unless Chicago rises up and throws out the current slave masters degree n the city go verment all you will get is lip service. Why does all the good schools exist on in wealthy districts? Why do they get better police protection?

@bigleaguepol @EasiWebsites More and more is coming out in the only way that will ever find out the whole trip is to have a second special counsel established to look into the Clinton emails the FBI cover-up the doj cover up the doj and FBI conspiracy to overthrow the elected president of the United States
@LSHMS1 @waltshaub Melodramatic drama on Broadway this is not like it would be an issue. Horse slaughter
@youlivethrice @skeeter980 When the FBI as over 108 receiving bribes to pass on classified as sensitive information to the news media the FBI is corrupt to the Core
@Thomas1774Paine Goes to show a DemoRats can pretend to be a Republican.
@Thomas1774Paine Two bad for John, guess when it's all said and done he will have no legacy
@BareDownCB @mlong42947 @FBI Let's not forget the 100 FBI agents that the IG uncovered as receiving bribes to pass on classified information to NBC ABC CBS and CNN + others
@DMVBlackLives I cannot support you in everything you believe in but one thing I do believe in there's a two-tiered justice system in here one for the rich and one for the rest of us poor bastards that have to do time
IG report provides information that shows there was a conspiracy to screw Donald Trump the FBI and the doj needs to be investigated by a Outside Agency that has been given full authority to look all the evidence
@DMVBlackLives @DCPoliceDept @ChiefNewsham @SafeDC Remember those Democratic leaders that step forward and stood  in line of solidarity for you Baby Gone. Time to think outside the box Democrats no matter the color are self-serving bastards
@HouseGOP @SenateGOP the inspector General's report on the Clinton email investigation reveals that there was a conspiracy within the FBI in the doj to screw Donald Trump. Why are y'all ignoring this problem get a second Council let's get these bastards out
@BrendaLBusby1 There are thousands of FBI agents are taking bribes right now so they're right up there with Peter struck
@HouseGOP @SenateGOP  why are you ignoring the fact that hundreds and thousands of FBI agents are taking bribes that are being given to them to leak sensitive classified information. It's in the IG report. Where are those thousands of agents that work so hard that are honest.
@Pismo_B @adeplorablecore What I find really bad is no one has uttered the word conspiracy. The IG report has provided more than ample evidence that there was a conspiracy in the FBI to screw Donald Trump.
RT @Tattoobear: https://t.co/n4xrAUz9gw
@Thomas1774Paine It would be easier just to provide a short list of those agents that did not take bribes. But do not worry citizens the FBI's on top of it
@rhondamint Forget the Pie strain I just want the hundreds of FBI agents that have taken brides and bribery from CNN ABC CBS The New York Times to be prosecuted. Good Old Boy director Ray realizes that if he prosecute all the agents for brides a key there won't be anybody left
@The_Trump_Train Some people just always try to resurrect their self in the news importantly hundreds of FBI agents have been found to be taking Brides from ABC CBS NBC and CNN that's the big story

@seanhannity What's the definition of conspiracy? We have that definition right before I face in the IG report and the FBI formed a conspiracy with the Department of Justice not to indict Hillary Clinton but to also bring down the duly elected president of the United States. Abolish the FBI
@paulsperry_ You would think that Congress would be tired of being played. More examples of the FBI lying to Congress lying to the public and lying to the IG.

@BLMPDX I hope and pray that you have a revelation and realize that because of your low population numbers and demographics the black people of America are being put on the back of the bus again by the Democratic Party. They now prefer to court illegal immigrants as voters
@IancuVladim @HH_kathy Just wait until the black people of America realize that the Democrats are now putting them in back of the bus again so that they can concentrate on illegal criminals coming into the country

@Lrihendry @phil200269 Kudos kudos for making a crude state if the truth be known and if someone really wants to close this it's all about making money off immigrants GOP Walsh cheap labor the Democrat they sell special visas like their candy.
135 billion dollars per year is spent illegal immigrants. Time to fix immigration time to take that money and to use it to train people 4 jobs in the building trade that will allow them to get on welfare in to join the rest of America in prosperity.
For all you stupid people this country is not ruled by emotions it's rule by law . Democrats and Republicans all the man that they saw this immigration problem once and for all compromise do whatever it takes but solve this problem

@amzieaa @thehill They violated proper procedures so yes they are going to be punished however they did have loyalty to the Constitution of the United States unlike some of the other riff-raff that inhabits Washington DC. Did not hide behind right National Security did they

@calloutlm1 @intheMatrixxx @B754344255 The house congressman do not rely on the FBI and doj to find the text you need to go directly to the NSA and have them pull the texts and emails from those two suspected individuals strut and pay along with Comey McKay Clinton and Obama
@calloutlm1 @Annabarbe6 @intheMatrixxx @B754344255 The texts are not lost they are in the National Security Agency archives if they were deleted from there in order to be deleted the person's badge number that does the deleting would be recorded.
@BlissTabitha If the alphabet soup news agencies would give equal coverage to both sides of the coin,immigration policy we could get things accomplished as far as immigration reform. When they refuse to equate illegal alien murdering Americans with immigration issues makes it a non-starter
@Lrihendry You may quote me on this in a recent video a North Korean General was seen saluting president Trump. This seldom happens between North Korea and United States officials this is a signal from North Korea to the United States about there sincerity 2 the nuke.
