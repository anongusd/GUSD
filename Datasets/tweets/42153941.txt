"Not one question so far as been asked about Mr. Trump" Michael Cohen says of Republicans.
Meadows brings up what will become the crux of this hearing for Republicans: So long as Cohen doesn't have definitive proof of his claims -- "tapes," etc -- his testimony is moot.
Meadows is flustered momentarily. Asks why Lynne Patton, as the daughter of someone from Birmingham, Alabama, would work for a racist. Cohen says because as the descendant of a Holocaust survivor, he did so, too.
amazing clash of accents going on here
Jim Jordan suggests that for Michael Cohen, this all about "not getting brought to the dance" -- aka not working in the White House.
Michael Cohen says lying to the First Lady is "one of his biggest regrets," calls her a "kind" and "good person."
Michael Cohen says that Trump told him black people would never vote for him because "they were too stupid." Notes that he continued to work for him.
Michael Cohen says Trump "is complicated, as am I."

Today was a huge production in which the vice president, secretary of homeland security, and acting OMB director addressed the GOP conference, and then the president delivered his first address from the Oval Office. And yet nothing has changed from when this shutdown began.
https://t.co/XLTvSUfLRl
BUT: Pence chimes in to say he was here on 9/11 and there were only 19 then, ‚Äúso don‚Äôt think a small number of known or suspected terrorists isn‚Äôt a big deal,‚Äù source paraphrases.
I‚Äôm told Ross from FL asked for clarification on number of terrorist border crossings. Nielson broke the number down. (It‚Äôs small, as you‚Äôll recall from Chris Wallace‚Äôs interview w Sarah Sanders)....
VP concluded with a call for Rs to stick together. Am told no new guidance on how this moves forward, or any specifics on Trump‚Äôs speech tonight.
This is a key point of Pence‚Äôs talk: trying to convince House Rs that Dem approps bills this week are ‚Äúshow votes‚Äù that the Senate won‚Äôt take up anyway. I‚Äôm told POTUS himself has been concerned about growing number of House Rs inclined to vote for them.
Pence currently reiterating point that McConnell will not take up the four approps bills this week.
Scratch that: am told Vought said food stamps, tax refunds, etc will be paid out through February, and that OMB looking at options for March ‚Äúif needed.‚Äù
VP Pence back up now, summarizing negotiations thus far. Nothing new.
I‚Äôm told Vought gives no timeline for how long these things will be paid out etc...
Vought also says that the Coast Guard will receive pay, that national parks staying open, and that trash is being picked up...
Vought says tax refunds and food stamps WILL continue to be paid out.
Nielsen concludes her presentation; OMB head Russ Vought is now discussing how they are mitigating effects of shutdown
Some stats she‚Äôs citing per source in room: 17,000 adults with existing criminal records at the border, 6,000 gang members in fy18; $2.5 billion a year to criminal organizations from migrant smugglers; 60,000 unaccompanied children in fy18
Nielsen‚Äôs presentation to GOP members right now is same one she gave to bipartisan congressional aides over weekend, per sources at both. Stats of illegal border crossings etc.

In mere weeks, Pelosi went from having a big math problem in her bid for speaker to sitting pretty for a comfortable win on January 3rd.
Notably backing this are Tim Ryan, Ed Perlmutter, and Seth Moulton. You know who's still not voting for Pelosi? Kathleen Rice.
Specifics: "Members in senior leadership positions can serve three terms with an additional term with two-thirds support of the caucus."
But in reaching this agreement with the Dem "rebels," Pelosi has sewn up the votes she needs to be Speaker.
Remember: Steny Hoyer does NOT support this deal.
The proposal will be voted on by February 15th. "It is my intention to abide by it whether it passes or not," Pelosi affirms.

A member I was talking to in the GOP elex literally just left because he was bored. ‚ÄúSeveral better scheduling offers.‚Äù
Liz Cheney wins GOP conference chair, a position her father had too, by voice vote.
McHenry also seconding Cheney‚Äôs nomination
Getting interesting in the Dem caucus meeting, per source in room: CROWLEY brings up rules change for speaker nomination!
Dick Cheney in the room for this!
Brad Womack seconds.
Stefanik noms Liz Cheney for conference chair.
McCarthy concludes his remarks to standing ovation, including from Jim Jordan.
McCarthy tells members that he is determined to get back into majority next cycle ü§î
Lol: One member predicted to me that Jordan would get 55. ‚ÄúToo many freshman that watch Fox News.‚Äù https://t.co/bUNW2MI3hO
Would like to point out @BresPolitico predicted ‚Äúupper 40s‚Äù and I said 45
MCCARTHY wins 159, Jim Jordan 43.
Andy Barr nominated him - Wagner also seconded. Scalise elected unopposed.
Rodney Davis just finished the second nominating speech for Scalise for whip.
Brian Mast also supporting McCarthy
Elise Stefanik seconds nomination
Thornberry - also TX - nominates McCarthy for leader.
Kevin Brady comes in late to GOP leadership elections and the only thing I hear him say to a reporter is ‚Äúthe tax cuts are working‚Äù which at this point is the party‚Äôs version of a lullaby I guess
Chip Roy, Texas 21, elected to replace Lamar Smith, seconds nomination of Jim Jordan for minority leader

Theoretically, they'd only need 17 nays to block Pelosi on the floor. But Pelosi allies maintain that opposition today doesn't mean opposition in January. Lots of time to put on the charm offensive..
Look for Rule 34 discussion to come up in Dem caucus meeting with new members either this afternoon or tomorrow. Anti-Pelosi members say they expect to have a letter with 20+ dissenters by end of week.

Pelosi leaves caucus meeting confident in her chances of being speaker. Reporters mention that Seth Moulton says opposition absolutely has votes to block her. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a busy person,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI will be speaker no matter what he says.‚Äù
Tim Ryan tells reporters that there is zero chance he‚Äôll vote for Pelosi on the floor this year, unlike 2016 after he challenged her internally and lost.
Inside Dem caucus meeting, Schiff is hinting that we might hear something from Mueller before the end of the year.
So that‚Äôs how my morning is going
I sincerely thought this was some code name for some important legislative package but it‚Äôs actually just a bill about delisting gray wolves from endangered species
The people‚Äôs House: inside caucus meeting, members stressing how focusing on issues like ‚Äúgray wolves‚Äù is a waste of time when apropps bills still need to be dealt with
Lots of cheers audible from Dem caucus meeting. Looks like sources like intrigue as much as reporters! Person inside the room texts meeting is just ‚Äúrah rah stuff. The afternoon stuff should be more interesting.‚Äù

Thread. Over the course of several days, these are the public-facing ways in which Jeff Flake has wavered on his decision to confirm Kavanaugh:
ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I‚Äôm told by source with direct knowledge that Flake is ‚Äústill having issues‚Äù and that some colleagues are trying to ‚Äúwalk him through them.‚Äù Sen Coons tells me just now that Flake reached out to him and asked if they could speak at length later.
Cornyn and McConnell have long since left - Tillis, Grassley, Hatch, and Lee close out press conference. https://t.co/Du3fE7vPWy
Hatch: ‚ÄúThis is just wrong. And unfortunately there are some people who just don‚Äôt care.‚Äù
Grassley incredibly frustrated as he says it‚Äôs clear press is only interested in interviewing people who are AGAINST Kavanaugh. ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt be proud of that bias.‚Äù
Grassley says we‚Äôve almost hit rock bottom with ‚Äúall this.‚Äù ‚ÄúI would never use the word fake news. But I wanna show you where some of you have bias...
Why not green light FBI to interview additional witnesses? Cornyn: ‚ÄúThe FBI has been given all the permission they need to interview anyone...‚Äù This has become a ‚Äúsearch and destroy‚Äù mission, not a ‚Äúsearch for truth.‚Äù
LEE says they did not come up with a list of people the FBI should interview.
Tillis: ‚ÄúI would defy anyone in this room...to not have those same emotions.‚Äù
Tillis says Dems weren‚Äôt able to substantiate the allegations against him, so they moved their narrative to be about his ‚Äútemperament‚Äù during the hearing.
Tillis says he does believe Dr. Ford experienced something traumatic in her life - but there‚Äôs no evidence to suggest it involved Brett Kavanaugh.
Lee says he‚Äôs proven even more of his good character throughout this process, sharing facts with public even if they might be ‚Äúuncomfortable.‚Äù
Lee calls Kavanaugh a man of outstanding character who has lived an exemplary life.
Cornyn: ‚ÄúI believe we did treat Dr. Ford‚Äù the way he‚Äôd want his daughter, wife treated under similar circumstance.
Cornyn: ‚ÄúA vote against confirmation would be a vote for the shameful intimidation tactics that have been employed as part of a smear campaign.‚Äù
Cornyn: ‚ÄúIf this is the new normal, woe be to the Senate and any nominee that would be subjected to the character assassination we‚Äôve seen toward the nominee in this case...The Senate itself is on trial here.‚Äù
Hatch: ‚ÄúThis confirmation will be a victory for the institution of the Senate...I think he‚Äôs one of the best nominees I‚Äôve seen in my 42 years in the Senate.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôve been dealing with,‚Äù Grassley says of Schumer + Dems ‚Äúis really a demolition derby. They just about destroyed a good person.‚Äù
Grassley says he‚Äôs carried out what he promised immediately: ‚Äúa fair and thorough process.‚Äù
Grassley: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me we haven‚Äôt spent enough time‚Äù on Kavanaugh‚Äôs nomination.
McConnell says nothing that could have done would have satisfied Democrats. ‚ÄúThey have dug in.‚Äù
McConnell: ‚ÄúWhat we know for sure is that the FBI report did not corroborate any of the allegations.‚Äù
Joining him are Grassley, Hatch, Lee, Cornyn
One minute until Mitch McConnell presser begins...
I‚Äôm old enough to remember going on TV to talk about how the Stormy Daniels news cycle would influence midterms. https://t.co/09rlSF9wWa
Senator Corker is back to read over the report a second time, but describes it as more a formality than anything. Emphasizes repeatedly that there is ‚Äúzero corroboration.‚Äù
Senator Kennedy puts it bluntly: ‚ÄúThere is no corroboration.‚Äù Tells reporters he ‚Äúreally wishes‚Äù we could see the report. ‚ÄúThere are things in here that really make me angry.‚Äù

Manchin, of course, left his meeting with Collins, Murkowski, and Flake saying he was unsure. But thought source's use of "definitively prove" was interesting.
"Manchin likes Kavanaugh and has always wanted to find a way to support him."
Interesting: A source close to Senator Manchin tells me now, "Short of claims that definitively prove Dr. Ford's allegations or a realization that Kavanaugh will gut the healthcare law, Manchin will side with the overwhelming number of people in WV who want Kavanaugh confirmed."
Wow, floor vote has been set for Saturday. That suggests some confidence.

I'm told Senate Republicans have a conference meeting tonight post-hearing.
Omg, Graham's speech was only 45 minutes ago.
Democrats are doing themselves no favors by drilling down on the specifics of high-school drinking games.
Kavanaugh gets at the twilight-zone status a lot of Americans undoubtedly ascribe to this hearing: "We wanna talk about flatulence at age 16 on a yearbook page, I'm game."
Wow, Graham turns to Republicans: "To my Republican colleagues: If you vote no, you are legitimizing the most despicable thing I've seen in my time in politics."
Lindsey Graham is unloading. "This is the most unethical sham since I've been in politics."		"Boy, y'all want power, and I hope you never get it."

That's a wrap, folks. An overall win for Pelosi. Perlmutter has withdrawn the motion and the meeting is over.

Anyway, read the whole piece and let me know what you think! going to sleep now at long last
It amounts to a portrait of a woman who likely did have some nagging qualms about the president throughout her tenure, but valued her plum title and sense of power so much more.
My final take on Omarosa's book: Her weighted concerns about Charlottesville and a supposed N-word tape read as ham-fisted attempts to save face and squeeze a final fifteen minutes of fame out of her proximity to the leader of the free world. https://t.co/qOGFZjq37Q
That fall, when Don Jr. infamously compared Syrian refugees to a bowl of Skittles, Manigault Newman writes that Trump ‚Äújust shook his head and said, ‚ÄòLook what he did now. He screwed up again. What a f**kup.‚Äô‚Äù https://t.co/qOGFZjq37Q
Manigault Newman writes that she tried to confide in Lara Trump about what she calls the president's "mental decline." Lara, she claims, "didn't want to hear it." https://t.co/qOGFZjq37Q
@olgakhazan I realize that relationships can fizzle but sometimes a girl just wants answers.
She recalls watching a clip of a briefing with Trump when he said of Spicer, ‚ÄúHe looks like a spokesman from Men‚Äôs Warehouse [sic]. Cheap and tacky.‚Äù He would often refer to him in private, she says, as ‚ÄúMr. Men‚Äôs Warehouse [sic].‚Äù
New stuff on Reince Priebus and Sean Spicer added. Also: Omarosa implies that she wondered whether Trump and Paula White, televangelist and his spiritual adviser, had had an affair. https://t.co/6k5OHor56A

And the whole premise of her book, basically, is that she was fired *because* she knew of the tape! goodness gracious https://t.co/AJ91O7z9Rx
This contradicts what she says in her book, which is that she was "told exactly what Donald Trump said...During production he was miked, and there is definitely an audio track." Again, never writes that she has actually heard the purported tape. https://t.co/lugsD9ZMZz

To suggest that Pruitt‚Äôs demise was meticulously engineered by reporters, career staffers, or the so-called ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù‚Äîas some have suggested in the last 12 hours‚Äîis to ignore an inconvenient truth: Many members of Pruitt‚Äôs inner sanctum couldn‚Äôt stand their boss.

121-301. The House‚Äôs compromise immigration bill goes down hard.
I‚Äôm more confident than not that vote can still take place tomorrow on something. But just goes to show how Trump can make what should be an easy voice vote for GOP a headache at the last minute.
To recap: Leadership and WH leg staff expected to file narrow family separations bill last night. Charge was led in private by Cathy McMorris Rogers beginning last wk. But this morning, the day before they hope to vote on it, leaders are still unclear as to what Trump will back.

Anyway, read my story! https://t.co/VYze8xzYnA
(Lost on Trump maybe but certainly not @allahpundit!!)
Somewhat lost in all this, too, I think, is that Trump and Nielsen have gotten massively involved in whipping a bill that, even if it passes the House, will gather dust in the Senate. The thing is, I'm really not sure Trump realizes this.
Ultimately, congressional Republicans and Trump alike will share responsibility when immigration reform (most probably) fails on the floor tomorrow. The difference is that the former will likely shoulder it, while the latter will deny it.
I feel that much of this piece‚Äîmuch of the last two years, really, can be summed up by this graf: "Then Trump changed his mind."
"To be a House Republican leader in 2018 is to accept that every directive from President Donald Trump comes with an unspoken disclaimer: subject to change without notice." My take on the last 48 hours - https://t.co/VYze8xzYnA
A top aide to a Freedom Caucus member texted me after the conference about it. "What he did to Mark Sanford was sad. It reminded me of a sports fanbase that is used to losing, finally wins something, and reminds everyone that they won. Act like you've been there."

@allahpundit They don‚Äôt; they don‚Äôt exist.
I‚Äôm getting the same read from every member I‚Äôve talked to post-meeting: Trump will sign the compromise bill into law. But there is no new sense that House Rs are any closer to 218.
Final message!!! ‚ÄúPass the bill.‚Äù No Q&amp;A, I‚Äôm told. Meeting over.
Trump stresses that both the Wall and DACA fix ‚Äúpoll really highly‚Äù and conference needs to ‚Äúdo something‚Äù on them.
Senior GOP source concludes re immigration: probably enough now to whip the vote, but unlikely to be enough for 218.
Votes are in a few minutes...not sure if this can last much longer?
Healthcare! What about healthcare? ‚ÄúHigh level generalities,‚Äù source texts.
Now we‚Äôre onto politics, midterms. It appears the conference ostensibly about immigration has included very little talk of immigration.
WELL THEN! Congressman Vargas tries to get up to entrance of GOP conference with a sign that says ‚ÄúFamilies Belong Together.‚Äù
Source says we are on the ‚ÄúOverview of Accomplishments‚Äù portion of this conference.
Earlier, Trump said he wanted ‚Äúchanges‚Äù to leadership‚Äôs immigration bill. But sources say he so far hasn‚Äôt mentioned any changes he wants.
ANDDD we‚Äôre already off immigration! On to North Korea now, source says.
No explicit endorsement yet, I‚Äôm told, of leadership‚Äôs bill, which is of course what they were hoping for.
This per source in the room. Trump also asked Jim Jordan to stand up. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a warrior,‚Äù POTUS said.
INSIDE THE ROOM: Trump tells GOP conference of family separation at border - ‚ÄúThis is a dangerous issue. The images are bad for us. A sad situation and we have to something.‚Äù Then: ‚ÄúWe have to get one of the bills passed.‚Äù

@shobana_km ...can only pass the House if leadership is able to pick off Democrats. And that‚Äôs a big if!
@shobana_km There‚Äôs always a chance! But right now Goodlatte doesn‚Äôt have the votes, and things aren‚Äôt looking great for the ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù bill. That could change, of course, once we see the text and members know more about what‚Äôs in it. But I think the compromise bill...
Here‚Äôs the bottom line: just because a piece of legislation is on the schedule doesn‚Äôt meant the disagreements are any different.
Miller's pitch was essentially that the US has been steeped in bad immigration laws since the 1960s, and this is Republicans' best shot at changing them.
Obviously, this remains the sticking point. And it does, in fact, give DACA recipients a leg up in the citizenship process. So I don't know how Jim Jordan goes for this.
I'm told Labrador was clear in RSC meeting with Stephen Miller that he spoke on behalf of his subcommittee, not the HFC. He pitched his special visa/point-based path to citizenship as the DACA component of the compromise bill.

Idea: pick off members committed to passing the ag/dairy provisions in Goodlatte - and there are several! - and swing them to the compromise bill instead with this promise for a vote
One idea they‚Äôre floating, based on what I‚Äôm hearing from member inside: base the compromise bill next week on Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúfour pillars‚Äù and guarantee a separate vote on ag/dairy provisions - which have in part stymied progress on Goodlatte - in July.
