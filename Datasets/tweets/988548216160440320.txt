@BBCVishalaSP @BBCWorld @netflix @BBCBusiness @SallyBundockBBC Should television be making oft-bankrupt and obviously corrupt television stars into politicians? Tweet me your opinion!		Seriously, the man broke a glass ceiling, won a Nobel Peace Prize, and is overall cool as hell. Let the man live his best life without our judgemental bs!

I don't understand how we got to the point that Americans are so easily fooled as to elect this man. How did self-absorption become something desirable in a politician? https://t.co/ie2ArdnFo7

@KevinHart4real @TheRock 	Your mission if you choose to accept it:	Help aspiring comedians by explaining how you go from being silly/entertaining in everyday life to writing jokes that can make your bank account overflow. Seriously. Some people can't afford college.
