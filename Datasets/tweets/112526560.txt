VIDEO: Here's a link to the full hearing from Wednesday of the hearing of the U.K. parliament's foreign affairs committee, which was quite skeptical of both the U.S. lobbying &amp; the sanctions relief for DERIPASKA's companies, as this clip makes clear. https://t.co/59qrWCYHfW https://t.co/IcN6GWzYRL
FARA LOOPHOLE: The law firms that helped negotiate the sanctions relief for DERIPASKA's companies — including @lathamwatkins, @steptoellp &amp; @Dentons — were not required to disclose how much they were paid under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, because it exempts legal work.
The British Lord (@GregBarkerUK) who leads DERIPASKA's cos. reportedly will receive a "success fee" for leading effort to lift US sanctions.	He suggested to parliament MERCURY, which lobbied for sanctions relief, also would receive a success fee, but his spox now denies that.
DERIPASKA PAYDAY REVEALED: Washington lawyers who negotiated a deal with @USTreasury to lift sanctions on the Russian oligarch's companies were paid "a multiple" of the $600k+ that was paid to Mercury Public Affairs for lobbying to lift the sanctions, per @GregBarkerUK last week. https://t.co/BXxKDX5vUm

IVANKA RESPONDS: To criticism that she doesn’t know what it’s like to have to work for what you get, @IvankaTrump at last-night’s (white-tie) gridiron dinner, quips “as if being Donald Trump's daughter isn't the hardest job in the world.”	via @playbookplus https://t.co/WXItLUxmCv https://t.co/cC3m3PxtYB

WHY THE DATES MATTER: Our reporting was that MANAFORT (through GATES) first shared polling data with KILIMNIK in the spring, when Russia was ramping up its social media operation to help TRUMP's campaign.	We fleshed out the exchange a bit more here: https://t.co/7VNzCKq7hZ
See this section &amp; footnote indicating that "as a result of media coverage of the breach litigation, GATES (through counsel) provided information to [MUELLER] about [REDACTED]," resulting in a 2/15/19 debriefing — which could point to our story as trigger. https://t.co/xfnnr5KNQR https://t.co/sQDZv3OmBj
INTERESTING NEW MUELLER FILING: The special counsel's office seems to be clarifying in this filing that TRUMP polling data was provided by RICK GATES to KILIMNIK, possibly separately from the 8/2/16 Grand Havana meeting, which comports with our reporting. https://t.co/wTsUuPgeu7

It includes "a proposal for a US Congressional delegation to Ukraine." https://t.co/a1lNvkUvuA
MUELLER DOCUMENT: Here's the full 577-page exhibit detailing MANAFORT's Ukrainian lobbying, including communications with YANUKOVYCH, KILIMNIK, GATES, PODESTA, @SkaddenArps, etc., as well as his use of overseas accounts to pay the firms he recruited. https://t.co/yZLXFPGDUN

RT @rachelweinerwp: @kenvogel No, Podesta was mentioned in the exhibits at Manafort's Virginia trial -- in emails
Pursuant to our story today detailing KILIMNIK's work with Western governments, MUELLER references a memo Kilimnik sent to MANAFORT "about contact with the European and US government regarding Tymoshenko." *It's not clear from this whether KK was making the contacts himself. https://t.co/vxb9AGirim
MUELLER: As MANAFORT &amp; his team worked to quell US scrutiny of YANUKOVYCH's imprisonment of a political rival, they engaged "in backroom lobbying using personal contacts &amp; confidential Congressional information obtained secretly by [REDACTED] from Congressional staff." https://t.co/sH7QP6Aevd
MUELLER details how MANAFORT resigned as an @opicgov director under RONALD REAGAN "in connection with a @TheJusticeDept review" of his undisclosed FARA lobbying in the 1980s.	The clear implication: he should have known better than to flout FARA again. But he did anyway. https://t.co/sJzwVqnxyT
INTERESTING: There are several unredacted references to TONY PODESTA's work with MANAFORT for the Russia-aligned government of Ukraine.	* I believe this is the first time that Podesta has been named in the Mueller filings or exhibits, but correct me if I'm wrong, #MuellerTwitter https://t.co/sOJ3jv1ssr
And here's a reference to a 2010 email in which MANAFORT suggests that YANUKOVYCH provide bonuses to people on Manafort's team, including one person listed as "Main US Lobbyist".	* No one on Manafort's team was registered to lobby in the US at that time. https://t.co/0SxmNL3kgp
MANAFORT long insisted he didn't lobby the US government on behalf of his Ukrainian clients, &amp; even when he was forced to retroactively FARA file, he only listed activity from 2012-2014.		But here's a document showing a mtg with the NSC's coordinator of US-Ukraine policy in 2005. https://t.co/z1e6DnzV4O
MUELLER also filed a 577-page attachment detailing payments MANAFORT directed from overseas accounts to Western firms enlisted to boost his client, the Russia-aligned Ukrainian president VIKTOR YANUKOVYCH.	Most firm names are redacted, but here are $4M in payments to @SkaddenArps https://t.co/mroCx4pxXi
JUST UPLOADED: In sentencing memo, MUELLER accuses MANAFORT of "bold" crimes, "some of which were committed while under a spotlight due to his work as the campaign chairman &amp;, later, while he was on bail from this Court." https://t.co/JNkwbz5ELE

@Delavegalaw If you read the story, I think you'll see that possibility is addressed.
@Rochambeau_1781 @nytimes INCORRECT: it had never been reported that Kilimnik &amp; Manafort were advising Oleksandr Klymenko.	Nor had it been reported that:	-After Kilimnik was accused of spying, he met with the US Ambassador to Ukraine	-the FBI tried to interview Kilimnik in Jan. 2017	*Do better research*
@DieFrageStellen Actually, you had never even heard Kilimnik's name (b/c it had not appeared on any English language website/social media) until my colleagues at @Politico &amp; I revealed his ID, suspected ties to Russian intel, work with Manafort &amp; their 2016 mtgs on 8/18/16 https://t.co/XF0rTz09oO
When KILIMNIK came to NY to visit MANAFORT in May '16, he told associates he hoped to meet with TRUMP &amp; potentially work with his campaign. 	A WH spox says "though it is possible that he was introduced to Kilimnik, the President has no recollection of it." https://t.co/7VNzCKq7hZ
Of course, it's possible that KILIMNIK was simultaneously working with Russian intelligence AND the US government, which could make him useful to both sides.	His story is complicated, &amp; he's a key figure in the MUELLER probe, which is why we devoted 3k words to a news profile.
@LALiberty16 @yashar Actually, you had never even heard Kilimnik's name (b/c it had not appeared on any English language website/social media) until my colleagues at @Politico &amp; I revealed his ID, suspected ties to Russian intel, work with Manafort &amp; their 2016 mtgs on 8/18/16 https://t.co/XF0rTz09oO
KILIMNIK CONTEXT: MUELLER has suggested MANAFORT's deputy was a Russian intelligence agent &amp; potential linchpin in the collusion narrative.	*But KONSTANTIN KILIMNIK met regularly with US officials — even after he was accused of being a Russian spy in 2016. https://t.co/7VNzCKq7hZ
SCOOP: In 2017, MANAFORT &amp; his Russian deputy KONSTANTIN KILIMNIK advised a Moscow-based Ukrainian political party that was all-but overtly aligned with the Kremlin. It was headed by a YANUKOVYCH ally who was living in exile &amp; under sanctions in Moscow. https://t.co/7VNzCKq7hZ

"Mr. KILIMNIK doesn't have to be in the government or even be an active spy to be a link" between the Kremlin &amp; the TRUMP campaign, says Judge Amy Berman Jackson, adding the interactions between MANAFORT &amp; KILIMNIK are "at the undisputed core" of MUELLER's probe. https://t.co/dmgt0aFcff
Is KILIMNIK a US gov't ally, as MANAFORT's team has suggested, or is he linked to Russian intel, as MUELLER's team has claimed?	The judge appears to suggest both could be true.	Either way, she says it doesn't change the fact Manafort lied about his interactions with Kilimnik. https://t.co/MgwA36PzkU
The judge throws some shade at MANAFORT team's effort to impugn RICK GATES' testimony, noting that MANAFORT pleaded guilty to tax evasion, bank fraud, FBAR, &amp; FARA charges built on Gates' testimony. https://t.co/P2nMECAZRD
The work MANAFORT was pursuing in Ukraine with KILIMNIK "doesn't seem to have ever been far from Manafort's mind, even when he was working on the campaign," said Judge Amy Berman Jackson, dismissing Manafort attys' claims that he misremembered details b/c he was focused on TRUMP. https://t.co/7gKUwe2eXg
MANAFORT relayed polling questions -- possibly about the peace plan -- to KILIMNIK to add to a Ukrainian public opinion survey, then lied about it to MUELLER, said the Judge. "These were the questions that were provided by Manafort and they were important to him and to Kilimnik." https://t.co/wuKXYXKECq
@pml_tray I'm not saying it was just a coincidence. I'm saying your claim is not proven.
@pml_tray Not proven. And in fact explicitly denied by Deripaska.
MANAFORT lied to MUELLER's team when he claimed he "put the kibosh" on a Russia-Ukraine "peace plan" that KILIMNIK discussed with him at the GRAND HAVANA ROOM, Judge AMY BERMAN JACKSON concluded, per new transcript. "This is not supported by any evidence," including emails. https://t.co/MQ5woF2oRd
NEW TRANSCRIPT: The judge describes MANAFORT's misrepresentation of KILIMNIK's understanding of Russia-aligned lobbying as "a problematic attempt to shield his Russian conspirator from liability and it gives rise to LEGITIMATE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHERE HIS LOYALTIES LIE ."
MUELLER SENTENCING MEMO: MANAFORT was "plainly the leader" of a "criminal scheme" that included RICK GATES, KONSTANTIN KILIMNIK &amp; others. Special Counsel recommends a sentence of 19.5 to 24.5 years in prison. https://t.co/CKdzMiApLW

And a Ukrainian court has since ruled that @LeshchenkoS's dissemination of info about MANAFORT from the documents violated Ukrainian law &amp; "led to interference in the electoral processes of the United States in 2016 &amp; harmed the interests of Ukraine.” https://t.co/ysg3dkz4ph

PAUL MANAFORT &amp; RICK GATES knew that their meeting with KONSTANTIN KILIMNIK during the 2016 campaign could look bad, &amp; they took steps to conceal it, leaving the meeting separately, according to MUELLER's team. https://t.co/tE6LZWrlKE

LYOVOCHKIN &amp; AKHMETOV did not respond to questions about whether they received the polling data from KILIMNIK, or about their interactions during the campaign with MANAFORT &amp; Kilimnik. https://t.co/xfnnr5KNQR
LYOVOCHKIN &amp; AKHMETOV had funded Russia-aligned political parties for which MANAFORT had worked. Manafort believed he was still owed $$$ for the work. Passing along polling data to the oligarchs could be a way to try to collect by proving continued value. https://t.co/xfnnr5KNQR

Reporters keep asking whether TRUMP would like a less hostile relationship with the press. But it seems pretty clear that he does not. His attacks on the media are fundamental to his political identity: "I'm fighting back not for me, but for the people of this country."
HOW TRUMP SEES PRESS CONFERENCES LIKE THIS ONE: When @HunterW encourages him to hold more press conferences because they lead to accountability, TRUMP corrects him: "It's called earned media. It's worth billions."
Asked about the racial undertones of his embrace of the label "nationalist," TRUMP repeatedly tells @Yamiche "that's such a racist question." He adds "to say that, it's so insulting to me."
WILL TRUMP STOP ATTACKING THE MEDIA? The short answer would appear to be NO: "I would love to see unity &amp; peace &amp; love &amp; any other word you want to use … We had to wait until after the midterms are over &amp; now they're over … When you're not treated fairly, you have no choice."
WHICH ELECTION IS TRUMP TALKING ABOUT? "I thought it was very close to a complete victory."
YEEESH: The level of personal vitriol TRUMP expresses in this exchange with @Acosta is really something: "@CNN should be ashamed of itself having you working for them. You are a rude, terrible person. You shouldn't be working for CNN." https://t.co/fvn2BS9DZK
NOT THE WAY BIPARTISANSHIP WORKS: TRUMP suggests that he will only work with House Democrats if they refrain from aggressive oversight with subpoenas. "If that happens, then we're going to do the same thing &amp; government comes to a halt, &amp; then I would blame them."
WHAT HAPPENED TO #JOBSNOTMOBS? Divided government "really could be a beautiful bipartisan type of situation," TRUMP says.

TRUMP, tonight in Florida: “I always want to tell the truth. When I can, I tell the truth. And sometimes it turns out to be where something happens that’s different or there’s a change, but I always like to be truthful.” 	https://t.co/9Yz2JkOZrW
NEW DETAILS: After the 2016 election, GEORGE SOROS donated $1M to a nonprofit called the DEMOCRACY INTEGRITY PROJECT, which has continued pushing TRUMP-RUSSIA stories, &amp; has paid FUSION GPS for research. Soros is considering donating more to the group. https://t.co/7IFTJXR8mF
TO BE CLEAR: @GeorgeSoros's donations played a major role in shaping post-Soviet Eastern Europe, &amp; also re-ordering the institutional left in the U.S. But his biggest U.S. political efforts — defeating BUSH in '04 &amp; TRUMP in '16 — failed. https://t.co/7IFTJXR8mF
The threats like the pipe bomb that targeted @GeorgeSoros are “the admission ticket for playing in this arena," says STEVE BANNON. He adds "SOROS is vilified because he is effective ... I only hope one day I’m as effective as he has been — &amp; as vilified." https://t.co/7IFTJXR8mF

In new intervu, TRUMP acknowledges the SAUDI stories on KHASHOGGI have been “all over the place,” marked by “deception” &amp; “lies,” but he does not call for MBS’s ouster. “He’s seen as a person who can keep things under check...I mean that in a positive way” https://t.co/JC4xXOguN8

@_ScottArnold @georgesoros do your homework on my reporting
People don't generally take time out of their busy lives to go to protests unless they feel strongly about an issue -- regardless of whether they're being urged to do so (or even having their transportation subsidized) by a group funded by the KOCH BROTHERS or GEORGE SOROS.
I would add: The fact that protests are organized by big-$ groups doesn't make them any less real or powerful. The left's effort to dismiss tea party protesters as KOCH-funded pawns missed the point, as do the right's efforts to dismiss KAVANAUGH protesters as @GEORGESOROS pawns.
—This is how political advocacy is funded in America.	—There's usually very little info on the donors behind it, thanks to lax disclosure rules.	—@GeorgeSoros &amp; @OpenSociety actually tend to be more transparent than most donors on the right (or the left, for that matter). 3/3
And orgs airing pro-KAVANAUGH ads have received $ from top GOP donors, including:	—@judicialnetwork: $23M in '16 from secret-$ Wellspring Cmte	—@americafirstpol: $15M+ in '17 from pro-TRUMP donors	—@45_Committee: $30M raised in '16 for it &amp; its super PAC by Todd Ricketts. 2/3
FACT CHECK ON TRUMP'S SOROS CLAIM:	Some of the groups organizing KAVANAUGH protests HAVE in fact received significant $ from @GEORGESOROS's @OpenSociety foundations, including:	—@PopDemoc &amp; @CPDAction: $2.7M in '16/'17	—@PPact: $10M in '17	—@ACLU: $405k to various arms in '16/'17 https://t.co/pUJDen4oCR

BULLETIN BOARD IT: @TG3II says of the @RamsNFL: "We can't be beat right now."
Why does BRETT KAVANAUGH keep talking about rumors that he was in gangs, or on boats in Rhode Island? Those seem like straw arguments, since no one at this hearing has broached those subjects, unless I missed something.
KAVANAUGH: "We live in a country devoted to due process &amp; the rule of law. That means taking allegations seriously…But if the mere assertion of an allegation…is enough to destroy a person's life &amp; career, we will have abandoned the basic principles of fairness &amp; due process…"
A denial that is both very specific &amp; very sweeping: https://t.co/gY8aUChReQ
Now the specifics: "I categorically &amp; unequivocally deny the allegation against me by Dr Ford. I never had any sexual or physical encounter…with Dr Ford. I never attended a gathering like the one Dr Ford describes in her allegation. I never sexually assaulted Dr Ford or anyone."
BRETT KAVANAUGH spending a lot more time assailing Democrats, the confirmation process &amp; American politics more generally, than in addressing CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD's specific allegations.
Senator @JohnCornyn, in hallway after CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD testimony: "I found no reason to find her not credible."	*** BUT, he then added quickly: "There are obviously gaps in her story. Obviously, people who are traumatized have those sort of gaps."

@mikiebarb @mcorley @mega2e I think he was talking about @LisaBloom raising $ to help women who came forward with allegations against him -- as we revealed here: https://t.co/im1iT36tYS -- though there is no evidence that any of these women were paid to make false claims.
TRUMP is comparing his press conference to an ELTON JOHN concert, expressing his desire to finish with a "good" question.
RT @morningmoneyben: I'll take just one more question from Cat Fancy magazine and then I really do have to go.
TRUMP claims that women "got paid a lot of $ to make up stories about me."	FACT CHECK: We reported that @LisaBloom raised $ to support women who leveled allegations. But there’s NO EVIDENCE that women were paid to "make up stories." https://t.co/im1iT36tYS https://t.co/J0k29CF70L
TRUMP says airing of allegations against KAVANAUGH creates "a horrible precedent" because "I could have a lot of SCOTUS judges -- more than two ... I don't want to be in a position where people say 'no thanks' ... We have a country to run. We want the best talent in the world."

It can be hard to gain visibility into the inner workings of so-called dark money groups. Every once in a while, though, you can get a glimpse when a disgruntled vendor sues. @daveweigel has some juicy details emerging from a lawsuit against @NoLabelsOrg. https://t.co/WmDIeVre4E
Bill Taylor, who is representing GREG CRAIG in a case referred by MUELLER to the SDNY, has represented a litany of high-profile political clients accused of all manner of wrongdoing: DOMINIQUE STRAUSS-KAHN, DON BLANKENSHIP &amp; LOIS LERNER, among others. https://t.co/Yu8I3ryYC6
GREG CRAIG LAWYERS UP: The former Obama WH Counsel, under SDNY investigation for his work with MANAFORT on behalf of pro-Russian Ukrainians, has hired top criminal defense lawyer BILL TAYLOR, @MattGoldstein26 &amp; I revealed. The case was referred by MUELLER. https://t.co/eubx2gJzfq
NEW DOC: PODESTA was “initially inclined to register under FARA" for MANAFORT work. Instead, he registered with Congress after being assured that the client was not controlled or funded by YANUKOVYCH.	MUELLER says that was a lie, &amp; Podesta knew it. #FOIA https://t.co/qduzGJjZ0h https://t.co/v8I9pcU5hj
Allies of PODESTA &amp; MERCURY are seething at MANAFORT right now. They blame him for misleading them into FARA violations back in 2012, &amp; now they're concerned that he's going to help MUELLER frame them for work he orchestrated. https://t.co/eubx2gJzfq
NEW: People who worked with MANAFORT in Ukraine think his real value to MUELLER may be flipping on the oligarchs, the pols they funded &amp; the Western firms/operatives who assisted them, including ones he recruited, like TONY PODESTA, MERCURY &amp; @SKADDENARPS. https://t.co/eubx2gJzfq
#CampaignFinanceTweetOfTheWeek #2 https://t.co/mrjTaNUN4x
I’m sure the small donors powering the TRUMP campaign appreciate the campaign manager &amp; @EricTrump spending their hard-earned $$$ on a private jet trip to California to schmooze major donors at closed-door events! https://t.co/qT5saeHH4K
IN HIS OWN WORDS: In 2010 memo, MANAFORT lays out an international lobbying plan for YANUKOVYCH, but specifies "Publicly, I will not appear as a lobbyist for your government. Those roles would be the firms that I bring in…In fact, I would be the point…" https://t.co/rtfwJKzdcl https://t.co/H9LNvAOPcm
MORE BAD NEWS FOR PODESTA, MERCURY &amp; SKADDEN: As part of MANAFORT’s plea deal, he agrees to testify before all grand juries in DC and "elsewhere.” The inquiries into @PodestaGroup, Mercury &amp; @SkaddenArps are being run out of the Southern District of New York.
HERE IT IS: PAUL MANAFORT'S PLEA AGREEMENT: including a cooperation section. https://t.co/pgA1p6Wnfl https://t.co/3BxUnDNDHl
MORE BIG NAMES ENTANGLED IN MUELLER PROBE: 2012 memo from MANAFORT to GATES, KILIMNIK &amp; @alanfriedmanit laying out a "Ukraine Action Plan for Europe &amp; the US" indicates that PR giants @Fleishman &amp; @BMUKNews also worked on Manafort-directed Ukraine effort. https://t.co/yGDFTto2Su https://t.co/OqRoCWpbTC
@lachlan and Greg Craig
RT @jjouvenal: BREAKING: Prosecutors say Paul Manafort's plea deal includes 17 page cooperation agreement.
When @TheJusticeDept confronted MANAFORT &amp; GATES about their unregistered foreign lobbying back in 2016, they told a series of brazen lies to DOJ's FARA unit, per MUELLER, who methodically chronicled the lies here: https://t.co/QQMDQN1ga7
PODESTA &amp; MERCURY KNEW: New MUELLER info shows that the firms knew the non-profit they were representing was a front for MANAFORT's pro-Russian client. A Mercury employee said the set-up was "like Alice in Wonderland.” A Podesta employee called it “a fig leaf on a fig leaf.” https://t.co/atbX0SX6Uk
BAD FOR @PODESTAGROUP: Emails suggest that the lobbying firm knew all along that their work was for the pro-Russian government of Ukraine, &amp; not a non-profit group, per new info from MUELLER, which calls into question Podesta's basis for not registering under FARA. https://t.co/m5FN3yrerZ
DIRTY: MANAFORT orchestrated a scheme to have, "[O]bama jews,” as he described them, pressure the OBAMA administration to support his pro-Russian client YANUKOVYCH by "spreading stories in the US that a senior Cabinet official" was abetting antisemitism by supporting TYMOSHENKO. https://t.co/u6YDhbig7v
BAD FOR GREG CRAIG: His white shoe law firm @SKADDEN_ARPS accepted $4M from MANAFORT through overseas accounts to write whitewash report on YANOKOVYCH while privately expressing doubts about the report &amp; also secretly working more broadly for Yanukovych's pro-Russian regime. https://t.co/j6puIgZwdY
NEW MANAFORT DETAILS: Per superseding criminal information, Manafort asked European p.r. guys to push false story “[w]ith no fingerprints" alleging YANUKOVYCH's rival TYMOSHENKO had paid for murder of a Ukrainian official, acknowledging his "goal is to plant some stink on Tymo.” https://t.co/D4l3i4CtC6
#CampaignFinanceTweetOfTheWeek https://t.co/O8hI3E6sRZ
Most likely meaning that the documents might reveal things that MUELLER or @SDNYnews are investigating ---&gt; https://t.co/uZiOSLKR41
In response to my #FOIA for FARA records related to MANAFORT, GATES, @PodestaGroup, Mercury, @SkaddenArps , etc, @TheJusticeDept found 1,810 emails &amp; 1 DVD of documents.	BUT it only released a few dozen pages, withholding the rest under an exemption for law enforcement records. https://t.co/DxX8ails7H
RT @efstewart: Working late at @CherubAntiques on M Street, #georgetowndc https://t.co/QmEh9ZSGGR
DOCUMENT: Weeks after the election, @TheJusticeDept asked @GenFlynn to FARA register his work for a Turkish businessman. He registered 3 mos. later, but MUELLER's team still investigated his FARA lapse, before extracting a guilty plea on unrelated charges. https://t.co/JtMLaivnLe https://t.co/5lsWOiYapN
NEW DOCUMENTS: @TheJusticeDept started asking MANAFORT to explain why he didn't disclose his pro-Russian Ukrainian work under FARA back in Sept. 2016. Instead of FARA registering, Manafort &amp; Gates lied to DOJ about their work, according to MUELLER. https://t.co/vTSrTQ2fFZ https://t.co/pLR5XBJ6DZ
MANAFORT says he didn't lobby.	BUT in 2012, he emailed the US Ambassador to Ukraine, complaining that YANUKOVYCH was being disrespected: “The @StateDept statement on the election is an insult to the people of Ukraine &amp; those … working so hard to bring democracy to Ukraine." https://t.co/8RCFL0tjuv
This letter is part of a tranche of documents obtained via a lawsuit brought by @NYTimes &amp; @MFIAclinic against @TheJusticeDept under #FOIA. Taken together, they provide tantalizing hints about the extent of MANAFORT &amp; GATES's unregistered foreign lobbying. https://t.co/Wu7krm3gzH
NOTABLE: The lawyer who represented MANAFORT &amp; GATES in their fight with @TheJusticeDepartment, Melissa Laurenza of @Akin_Gump, later fought MUELLER's efforts to compel her to testify against Manafort. Mueller continues pushing for access to her emails with Manafort. https://t.co/ngWlhq0xCU
NEW DOCUMENT: In 2016 &amp; 2017, MANAFORT &amp; GATES fought @TheJusticeDept to avoid disclosure of their lobbying for pro-Russian Ukrainian interests by claiming they didn't have a contract with a pro-YANUKOVYCH nonprofit &amp; had deleted emails related to the work https://t.co/Wu7krm3gzH https://t.co/msCDV5FcgQ

MANAFORT FAMILY DRAMA: Jessica Manafort, daughter of the convicted lobbyist, is changing her last name to "Bond" (her mother's maiden name) “to separate myself &amp; my work from a public perception that has nothing to do with the person that I am.” https://t.co/qvG349iXd4
ALSO: In light of SAM PATTEN's guilty plea to lobbying &amp; finance violations, this quote from him from last year is quite something: “I’ve worked in Ukraine, Iraq, I’ve worked in deeply corrupt countries, and [the American] system isn’t very different.” https://t.co/NioaewHRT0
STATEMENT FROM LYOVOCHKIN: The pro-Russian oligarch who paid SAM PATTEN $1M+ acknowledges he attended TRUMP's inauguration, but asserts that he “did not pay for that.” Seems to leave wiggle room for possibility that Patten used Lyovochkin's $ for tickets. https://t.co/NioaewHRT0

SAM PATTEN specialized in off-the-radar &amp; unregistered lobbying for clients in former Soviet states. He told me last year that specialists like him are "more effective than 20 guys in slick suits who put their interns on an account to contact … Congress." https://t.co/AJ3dL47hON
ANOTHER KEY AREA WHERE PATTEN COULD HELP PROSECUTORS: 	—He worked for CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA around the world, including in the U.S.	https://t.co/AJ3dL47hON
IF SAM PATTEN FLIPS, IT COULD BE HUGE: He worked closely with:	—KONSTANTIN KILIMNIK, the Russian-intel linked operative who was MANAFORT's No. 2.	—RINAT AKHMETSHIN: the Russian-American lobbyist who attended the TRUMP TOWER meeting.	—VARIOUS OLIGARCHS who funded Manafort.
The document charging SAM PATTEN with violating FARA doesn't name KONSTANTIN KILIMNIK, but indicates that Patten &amp; "Foreigner A," a Russian, formed a US co. to do work starting in 2015.	And DC incorporation papers show that the pair formed Begemot Ventures International in 2015. https://t.co/KLZaOb1zNV
SAM PATTEN CHARGES ARE IMPORTANT: They relate to his work with longtime MANAFORT deputy KONSTANTIN KILIMNIK ("foreigner A" in charging doc) on behalf of a pro-Russian Ukrainian party for which Manafort also worked. Shows that MUELLER's work is bearing fruit beyond core of probe.

@SteveESpaulding @POTUS if it wasn’t knowing and willfull, it would be a civil infraction.
Provided there isn’t any documentary evidence to the contrary, the reasons TRUMP could plausibly pull off an ignorance defense are:	1) he’s demonstrated repeatedly that he doesn’t understand the law.	2) it’s a high bar to prove intent. https://t.co/abxtGR117K
TRUMP’S IGNORANCE DEFENSE: @POTUS’s best argument against potential campaign finance charges is that he didn’t know the law, &amp; therefore couldn’t knowingly &amp; willfully violate it. It’s actually a sound strategy, &amp; likely would make it tough to make a case. https://t.co/abxtGR117K

The key distinction between OBAMA's campaign finance violations &amp; COHEN's is that Cohen plead guilty to "knowingly &amp; willfully" violating the law, which makes his violation criminal.

If TRUMP had paid the $130k directly -- &amp; disclosed it on his campaign's @FEC report -- there would not have been any campaign finance violation. Instead, he apparently had MICHAEL COHEN do it, &amp; the result is count numbers 7 &amp; 8 in Cohen's guilty plea. https://t.co/m1y8UO7UX2

BAD BLOOD: As RICK GATES testified against him, PAUL MANAFORT glared continuously at his former protege in the witness box, his fists perched underneath his chin. Gates kept his gaze fixed on the floor in front of him, studiously avoiding eye-contact. https://t.co/K0tpKuwI8I
The line to get into the MANAFORT trial forms before 6:30am. Don’t try to cut it. Also, don’t run for the doors when news breaks, or you’ll piss off the judge, who compared the exodus of reporters to “rats leaving a sinking ship.” @ESCochrane’s pro-tips. https://t.co/O8Z1v3BIZU

NOTABLE: GATES testified that he discussed his affair with both his wife &amp; with MANAFORT.	Manafort not only did not fire him over the affair, but also remained supportive of him, Gates said. https://t.co/K0tpKuwI8I
@Wallacewriter this is only the 2nd day i've been in the courtroom (actually the overflow room, which has a closed-circuit live feed), &amp; i can *testify* to the speed of the testimony.
UPDATE: Just asked MANAFORT's atty KEVIN DOWNING whether he was accusing RICK GATES of lying about the # of affairs he had to: (1) MUELLER's team or (2) on the witness stand.	He paused to ponder, &amp; said he'd get back to me because "I don't want to get cross-wise with the judge."
And, with that final explosive volley, Gates concludes his testimony against his old boss &amp; mentor Manafort, leaving the jury lots to consider regarding the relative credibility of the two men. https://t.co/om2Vznj4Li
DRAMA: MANAFORT's attys accuse GATES of having FOUR extra-marital affairs, &amp; suggest that he lied to MUELLER's team about them, which they contend could jeopardize Gates's plea agreement.	Prosecutors objected to questioning, &amp; after sidebar with Judge, Manafort's attys back down.
Rick Gates shaved his beard, so someone needed to represent the unshaven at the courthouse. https://t.co/qo95Q7hx0n

I just asked KEVIN DOWNING whether RICK GATES’s remorse &amp; his matter-of-fact admission of his lies &amp; misdeeds had effectively inoculated him against the defense's efforts to cast him as an untrustworthy narrator. “I’m going to wait. We’ll see what the jury says.”
RICK GATES, on why he stole from PAUL MANAFORT: "In essence, I was living beyond my means … I regret it … I'm taking responsibility for it. I made a mistake."
GATES admits stealing $120k from MANAFORT by transferring it to a company he created called BADE LLC.	That's the same company that the @RNC paid $70k during the campaign for "political strategy services." https://t.co/1SD7sCvQKU https://t.co/nOOs8Xhd96
TRUMP INAUGURATION $: GATES was asked whether he received reimbursement for personal expenses from the presidential inaugural committee. "It's possible," he said.	The committee's public filings did not list a single penny paid to Gates. I've asked for an accounting of $ to Gates.
NEW: When GATES was working for TRUMP inaugural, MANAFORT emailed a list of people he "would like to invite to the inauguration," including a banker who issued $16M in fraudulent loans to Manafort, Steve Calk. Manafort also pushed Calk for Army Secretary. https://t.co/NCtf1rLxVA
GATES testifies that he remained with the campaign after MANAFORT resigned under pressure in August 2016.	*BUT campaign officials told me that Gates was forced to leave, &amp; ended up working for the @RNC, which paid $70k to a co. he started. https://t.co/1SD7sCvQKU
NEW: MANAFORT &amp; GATES assisted CURRENT Ukrainian president PETRO POROSHENKO in an unpaid capacity after YANUKOVYCH fled in 2014 — which is notable because Poroshenko’s regime has been accused of targeting Manafort in an effort to boost HILLARY CLINTON. https://t.co/NCtf1rLxVA
cc: @Fahrenthold.
NEW: MANAFORT &amp; GATES worked on a "legal project" for Ukrainian oligarch VICTOR PINCHUK, who donated $150k to the @TrumpFoundation for a 2015 speech by TRUMP — a payment which MUELLER is investigating.	*Pinchuk also donated $13M to @ClintonFdn. https://t.co/NCtf1rLxVA
NEW: MANAFORT &amp; GATES didn't merely help elect the Russia-aligned Ukrainian president YANUKOVYCH. They were paid $4M/year through a "policy contract" to help him govern, including helping him enact ”campaign promises.” https://t.co/NCtf1rLxVA
Judging by the hacked texts sent by PAUL MANAFORT's daughter -- like this exchange soon after he resigned from the TRUMP campaign amid reports about his work in Ukraine -- it does not appear as if Manafort was entirely forthcoming with his family. https://t.co/ODYxYSNEmY
Here's the email RICK GATES sent to friends &amp; family on the day he was indicted, which includes this defense of MANAFORT: "Much has been written about Paul Manafort and his companies. The distorted narrative of him created by the media is unfair." https://t.co/oTrrLcsYOh https://t.co/E5hiQCI5Yg
MEANWHILE, the guy who hired GATES to work at the firm co-founded by MANAFORT, recalls Gates fondly: "He was a guy I thought would go places someday,” says Charlie Black. "I didn’t know where he would end up, but I always liked him. I still do.” https://t.co/oTrrLcsYOh
MANAFORT &amp; his allies see GATES as a "traitor" with no spine. “Rick Gates owes everything to Paul. Paul made Rick a lot of $$$,” said one close Manafort friend. “But Rick is not the strong-valued guy that Paul is. Rick will go wherever the wind takes him." https://t.co/oTrrLcsYOh
NEW: RICK GATES' allegations in court today differed dramatically from his assessment on the day he &amp; PAUL MANAFORT were indicted. Back then, Gates emailed friends &amp; family defending Manafort: "The distorted narrative of him created by the media is unfair" https://t.co/oTrrLcsYOh

COINCIDENCE? PUTIN's claim about @BillBrowder's associates funneling $400M in ill-gotten $ from Russia to @HillaryClinton was laid out in the memo that NATALIA VESELNITSKAYA brought to her June 2016 TRUMP TOWER mtg with @DonaldJTrumpJr, KUSHNER &amp; MANAFORT. https://t.co/SgEzF4iDwe

JUST IN: Lawyers for MANAFORT counter witness-tampering allegations by arguing he can't tamper with witnesses, since he doesn't know who MUELLER is going to call as witnesses. https://t.co/AtLzRzXBN2
TELLING NUGGET: KILIMNIK, who lives in Russia &amp; is alleged to have ties to Russian intelligence, is apparently so unconcerned by MUELLER's investigation &amp; indictment that he doesn't even have a lawyer. https://t.co/YP2vigTpcr
NEW: After MANAFORT was indicted, he ignored allies' warnings to cease contact with KONSTANTIN KILIMNIK. They saw him as indiscreet &amp; feared he was under surveillance. “KK is one of the best interpreter &amp; translators. On everything else, he is a dumbass.” https://t.co/YP2vigTpcr
MANAFORT paid KONSTANTIN KILIMNIK $531k in 2013 &amp; 2014, according to lobbying records, but that covers only a fraction of the period (2005-2015) that Manafort employed Kilimnik, who was indicted today along with his former boss for obstruction. https://t.co/YP2vigTpcr

If you accept that version of events, then Trump’s payment to Cohen would not be an unreported in-kind donation/campaign expenditure, &amp; would not violate FECA. 3/3
Since TRUMP apparently didn’t reimburse Cohen until after Election Day, he could argue that he didn’t know about Cohen’s payment to @StormyDaniels during the campaign &amp;, as such, his payment to Cohen after the election was not intended to influence the election 2/
The key question in determining whether there’s a campaign finance violation will be whether TRUMP's reimbursement to @MichaelCohen212 for the $130k payment to @StormyDaniels was specifically intended to help Trump's campaign. 1/

@juliaioffe thanks, buddy. takes me back to the days before Russian intel ties were all the rage.
NOTABLE: MANAFORT &amp; GATES remained in communication with their Russian intel-linked associate KONSTANTIN KILIMNIK through the 2016 campaign (during which KK traveled to the US to meet with Manafort) all the way through late last year. https://t.co/NI0bKmE9s2
RICK GATES said that an associate with whom he &amp; MANAFORT worked for years “was a former Russian Intelligence Officer,” per new MUELLER filing. My sources tell me the associate, KONSTANTIN KILIMNIK, was colloquially described as "the guy from the GRU." https://t.co/NI0bKmE9s2

@Anthony @AlexMLeo @Hadas_Gold Distancing happened mid-campaign. In Cruz’s case, it was Feb 2016 — well before CA was the subject of critical media coverage.
@Anthony @AlexMLeo @Hadas_Gold the people who ran the actual campaigns that paid Cambridge Analytica assessed it to be ineffective (or at least exaggerated), so that's one indication.
The reason (some) operatives praised CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA was to appease the MERCERS. @TedCruz's campaign &amp; PAC touted the co. back when @tparti &amp; I broke the 1st Cambridge story in 7/15. But a few mos. later, they had all-but stopped using Cambridge's svcs https://t.co/pJ78CPajH8
@PhillyTurtleGuy or the company was unable to deliver anything useful even with the 50 million profiles.
@ivesjar No. Try to pay closer attention: they stopped using Cambridge mid-campaign, because it was not delivering the results they wanted.
BTW: It's not MY conclusion that CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA didn't deliver value for the campaigns &amp; PACs that paid it. That was the conclusion of the people who ran the campaigns &amp; PACs, some of whom stopped using the firm (or reduced its portfolio) mid-election because it was useless.

For all the money &amp; strategizing RUSSIA apparently devoted to its 2016 meddling, some of the efforts described in the MUELLER indictment today seem remarkably unsophisticated, i.e. this intel the Internet Research Agency gathered about where to target their efforts.

MUELLER INDICTMENT against RUSSIA's Internet Research Agency is by far the most significant charge ever brought under federal campaign finance laws barring foreign spending in US elections; indictment puts the lie to the notion that such laws are toothless.
@StephenGutowski No interest group creates voters, no matter how much they spend.
@StephenGutowski Taking us back to my original point: the @nra’s political strength stems more from its voter mobilization efforts than from its direct donations.
@StephenGutowski @NRA Yes, that’s usually a prerequisite to successful mobilization efforts, &amp; it also applies to labor.
@StephenGutowski @NRA And conversely, the @nra’s mobilization efforts reach far more people than just its membership — not unlike labor union’s efforts — which is one of the many reasons they’re so effective.
Gun-rights supporters are more politically active &amp; organized than opponents in large part BECAUSE OF THE @NRA &amp; its mobilization campaigns, which are the real strength of the organization — much more so than its direct donations. https://t.co/fxUALUJYIz

@jbarro @MichaelCohen212 ah, good catch.
@MrWalterShapiro @LizMair @MichaelCohen212 the fact that his longtime aide was involved would seem to rise to the legal definition of coordination.
@LizMair @jbarro @MichaelCohen212 that will be the determining factor in the @FEC's evaluation, I think.
@LizMair @MichaelCohen212 In that case, I believe the allegation was that it was coordinated with the campaign. Cohen is saying there was no coordination in his case.
@jbarro @MichaelCohen212 yes, correct.
If @MichaelCohen212 was not reimbursed by the campaign or its officials for the $130k payment, it's tough to see how it could be an over-the-limit in-kind contribution. If anything, it'd be an individual independent expenditure, which could be unlimited—even pre-Citizens United.
