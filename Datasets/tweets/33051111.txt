Whether in Flint, Michigan or Standing Rock, North Dakota families of color deserve the same right to water as everyone else.  #NODAPL
So that the land, including its sacred burial grounds, can be returned to peace. #NoDapl
In addition, we hope that their protection will be fortified by the federal government. #NoDapl
We recognize that this land has long been protected by the Sioux people and their ancestors. #NoDAPL
Because it recalled the way that dogs AND, ironically, water have been used to deny African Americans our humanity. #NODAPL
The use of dogs against the protesters was particularly haunting for us. #NoDapl
We are concerned about the infringement on the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's access to clean safe water in North Dakota. #NoDAPL

Tonight is your opportunity to show your support for this work and the change we will affect.
We look forward to expanding our model of outdoor leadership and stewardship globally.
In 2017, we look forward to sending a team to Africa, to climb Mt Kilimanjaro, to pay homage to the source of our strength on that continent https://t.co/rviOgz2N0h
This pilgrimage will serve as a reminder that nature can still help us get free.
In one week, a team of leaders will embark on a 40 mile pilgrimage on the #AppalachainTrail, tracing the steps of Harriet Tubman. https://t.co/afDJVGD2uX
I am especially proud of the ways our leaders showcase our history, strength, and aspirations in nature. https://t.co/HDPw83fkc7
I appreciate this community of friends and partners like you who are giving everyday folks the tools they need to live their best lives.
Our DC office will also allow us to lift up our enduring relationship in the natural world. https://t.co/BezVD8FaCL
Our DC office will allow us to build &amp; sustain relationships that will result in equitable access to safe, nearby green spaces.
I am proud to share that we have just opened our second office in Washington DC thanks to the @Wilderness. https://t.co/cZ1WDOPs4p
We will continue to raise our hand to protect funding for places we love &amp; urge for the protection of #wilderness areas. #WeAreTheArctic https://t.co/CUkI9Wu1WY
We have also stepped up our commitment to be at the table to advance policies and partnerships to change the face #conservation.
To live their best lives in the #outdoors that resist what we see online and in the headlines.
A safe place for reflection in troubled times, and self care, that won’t move life's mountains, but gives us the strength to climb &amp; thrive!
#OutdoorAfro healing hikes kicked off after the violence of Ferguson &amp; is now a critical tool in our work to help people find solace. https://t.co/82Ile9eRiL
People are losing a sense of belonging, with many finding ourselves once again in search of the warmth of other suns. https://t.co/MNqx79yRJi
Black communities and cultural centers  around the country are being forced and drained out of the urban landscape.
we are confronted with harrowing and senseless violence that remind many of us of a not too distant past of routine terror in the woods. 2/2
Within my joy in this work, I am sometimes deeply troubled.... These days when we imagine black bodies in the outdoors - anywhere - (1/2)

@BikeLeague For me, I always look forward to meeting new people and learning more.  #NBS15 #womenbike
People want to bike, but don't have them often. It's a risk management issue when people don't have a bike in good repair #NBS15 #womenbike

@JBIMPORTERS Brands have been key partners in our work for support and user education. Tip: find those influencers!  #NBS15  #womenbike
We need to do a better job of creating partnerships that help lift up emerging and effective efforts  #NBS15  #womenbike
@BikeLeague It often comes down to relevant leadership and funding  #NBS15 #womenbike
Feeling intimidated is one important reason to have networks of users who can venture together. It's empowering  #NBS15  #womenbike
@LauraMcShaneCLE but that assumes people view it as a reward! For those who are new, the sport can be intimidating #NBS15  #womenbike
