My thoughts are with federal employees across the country whose commitment to mission is unmatched. This demoralizing &amp; wasteful shutdown is no way to treat people who protect our resources, keep us safe, &amp; look out for the interest of current &amp; future generations.  We need them!
With a leadership change @ Interior, I profoundly hope the next chapter brings back respect for dedicated career staff, restoring science,  upholding trust &amp; treaty commitments to tribes, and putting the “public” back in public lands. Future generations deserve no less!
