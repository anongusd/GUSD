@OversightDems That said, Energy Secretary Rick Perry has met with Saudi officials to discuss a civil nuclear deal as 123 Agreement talks remain hobbled by Saudi Arabia's insistence to develop weapons if Iran does.		US-based Westinghouse is in the running to build 2 Saudi nuclear reactors.
@OversightDems Those deals -- known as "123 Agreements" -- are designed to reduce the chances of nuclear material ending up in the hands of extremist groups and from being developed into nuclear weapons. That's obviously a sensitive subject in the Middle East and with Saudi Arabia.
@OversightDems The report indicates IP3 pushed a plan to build nuclear reactors in Saudi Arabia without a nuclear cooperation deal as required by US law, and that Flynn and other NSC officials said such an agreement wasn't necessary -- despite career officials' insistence that it was.
@OversightDems Report shows the firm's plans &amp; conflicts of interest were so problematic that a senior political appointee and the National Security Council's legal adviser told staff to stop work on the plan.		IP3's idea to build Middle East reactors surfaced in last week's meeting with Trump.

@CharlieBakerMA @RoyCooperNC @RepMcClintock @RepWesterman .@CharlieBakerMA says RGGI system for reducing electricity emissions in East Coast states has been "incredibly effective" and that MA is "talking to the same states about doing something for transportation … nudging people to zero-emission vehicles over time.”
@CharlieBakerMA @RoyCooperNC @RepMcClintock @RepWesterman .@CharlieBakerMA "The most important thing is to establish long-term goals and objectives because that helps the private sector plan.” Adds those goals “can vary from region to region.”
@CharlieBakerMA @RoyCooperNC @RepMcClintock @RepWesterman .@CharlieBakerMA "that cod fishery is moving north and the lobster fishery is moving north … it’s a very big problem and it’s one that you don't have to project out, it’s already happening and it’s there and you can see it in the data.”
@CharlieBakerMA @RoyCooperNC @RepMcClintock @RepWesterman "clearly we need to be taking a much more forward-looking approach to that" @CharlieBakerMA says about not rebuilding the same way as before.
@CharlieBakerMA @RoyCooperNC Lots of focus from Rs on forests so far. Not surprising given the only attendees -- aside from Bishop -- are @RepMcClintock (whose district was affected by forest fires) &amp; @RepWesterman who sponsored last Congress' wildfire/forest management bill.
@CharlieBakerMA @RoyCooperNC .@CharlieBakerMA "I think we should continually be updating our rules and regulations with respect to new science.”
@CharlieBakerMA @RoyCooperNC .@RoyCooperNC said discussions about strategic retreat are brewing.		“We’ve come to the realization that these floods are going to continue to occur.”
@CharlieBakerMA @RoyCooperNC The attendance difference is pretty stark here - Dem lawmakers have almost full representation, only two Rs here aside from the ranking member.
@CharlieBakerMA @RoyCooperNC I can't believe I've been in this hearing 45 minutes and I haven't heard @CharlieBakerMA make one reference to Gronk, Brady or Dunkin Donuts.
@CharlieBakerMA @RoyCooperNC adds that Congress/administration should be "stopping the rollbacks that are occurring right now at the fed level particular when it comes to the Clean Power Plan and automobile emissions. We don't need to go backward in that area.”
@CharlieBakerMA @RoyCooperNC .@RoyCooperNC on whether innovation alone can solve climate: “Innovation is happening right now… but you have to make it economically feasible. State, local and federal govt working together can help push that along."
@CharlieBakerMA @RoyCooperNC .@RoyCooperNC "we're going to make a positive difference if we do this. we've got to get moving fast ... this needs to be a partnership and we want to work with you [Congress]."
@CharlieBakerMA .@RoyCooperNC  "It is not too late, but it soon may be. ... everyone's concerned about cost ... a move to a clean energy economy brings with it significant jobs and a significant economic boost. People may be surprised to learn that North Carolina is No. 2 in solar energy."
@CharlieBakerMA .@CharlieBakerMA: "if you have farmers or fishermen or resort operators or foresters in your communities or your districts I promise you they are worrying about climate change all the time."
.@CharlieBakerMA adds that more federal assistance needs to be available for communities before disasters to increase resiliency to climate change, storms, etc.
@CharlieBakerMA @RoyCooperNC @RepRaulGrijalva @RobBishopUT @Wilderness @USGS .@CharlieBakerMA says it's “essential for the federal govt to set a target” for states and regions for greenhouse gas reductions.

@CharlieBakerMA @RoyCooperNC @RepRaulGrijalva @RobBishopUT @Wilderness @USGS .@RoyCooperNC: "As Gov. of N.C., I have responsibility to help them make it. I have responsibility to help them keep safe. ... but when storms are becoming more fierce it's not just enough to pick up the pieces."

@CharlieBakerMA @RoyCooperNC @RepRaulGrijalva @RobBishopUT To be sure, studies have pointed out public lands -- which is in Natural Resources jurisdiction -- account for 25 percent of U.S. emissions, says @Wilderness, citing this @USGS report https://t.co/Ql5GSPmqV2
@CharlieBakerMA @RoyCooperNC @RepRaulGrijalva Ranking Member @RobBishopUT questions substance of climate hearing since committee doesn't have much overt jurisdiction over climate policy.		"Are these hearings for that group sitting over there at that table so they can write cute stories?” - he says, pointing to reporters.
@CharlieBakerMA @RoyCooperNC .@RepRaulGrijalva says states “can’t wait for action from an administration that appears not to care about their own well-being," perhaps in a nod to MA/NC govs. Appearance comes as Trump admin preps a final 5-year offshore drilling plan expected to go against govs' wishes.
I'm here at House Natural Resources Committee covering their hearing on climate change, where MA Gov. @CharlieBakerMA &amp; NC Gov. @RoyCooperNC are testifying.		Both governors have voiced opposition to Trump's draft plan to open Atlantic waters to offshore drilling.

@arvindpawan1 Much of this conversation had to do with the Overton window, so it will be interesting to see what ideas surface in the months ahead.
@arvindpawan1 If from emissions-only vantage point, perhaps. But there’s more to what GND activists are saying than getting to net zero.

@MichaelEMann To be sure, all this is within the context of "by 2030." But it's something environmentalists and progressives have called for (as noted in the story with on-record quotes).
@AOC @SenMarkey But this conversation of clean v. renewable has been burning within the broader environmental movement. 		Many see sources like carbon capture (enabling continued fossil fuel production) &amp; hydropower as ecologically harmful while exposing communities to pollution &amp; health hazards
@AOC @SenMarkey This parsing is important, especially for national Dems/2020 hopefuls. 		By avoiding an explicit fossil fuel ban &amp; keeping door open for tech that capture emissions from coal &amp; natural gas, coalition allies can keep labor &amp; fossil fuel-dependent communities engaged in process.
@AOC @SenMarkey AOC's spox said allowing fossil fuels to persist is "not what we're shooting for" and called for a "zero-carbon economy" in 10 yrs. He didn't refute the text makes no explicit mention of banning fossil fuels, saying, "The door is open for technology to solve this problem, sure.”
@AOC @SenMarkey The text also allows for clean -- rather than just renewable -- energy. This means nuclear, carbon capture and hydropower could all be in play.		That's a nod to the labor movement, which has many members across energy. But some environmentalists aren't jazzed about those fuels.
SCOOP - the Green New Deal being worked on by @AOC &amp; @SenMarkey does NOT explicitly call for banning fossil fuels.		https://t.co/wa7bnAyPUv

@BobMcElvaine @VarshPrakash These are, of course, different times. 		There were progressive Republicans in the Depression era who sided with Democrats.		And the economic crisis was more tangible to all Americans in a way climate change is not (even if it is, in many ways, tangible).
@BobMcElvaine The "how to" is the next part. That's how they plan to use the next 2 years, while also shoring up ambition &amp; guardrails for policy.		"I don't even think it's possible to reach the full scale of what we're talking about with one piece of legislation," @VarshPrakash said.

And, of course, the US has not pulled out of the Paris Agreement officially. US diplomats are at #COP24 right now working with China &amp; others on transparency/reporting requirements that will go into the Paris Agreement rulebook.
Lastly, there’s not really any money to return from Paris Agreement, unless you count climate finance. But, you know, the US does climate finance too through USAID, OPIC, etc.
The Yellow Vests very much want to address climate change. Fuel taxes happen to be a regressive tax, though. If a GOP-style tax overhaul were pushed in France, no doubt the Yellow Vests would object to that, too. (The overhaul was not a progressive — in economic terms — tax).

@johnnn Oh, totally. As an example of that, temporally containing GHGs within US borders as if it were a hazardous air pollutant like NOx does not respect the science of GHGs.
@johnnn They do consider GHGs, but they temporally limited it by only considering US and not global effect. That alone significantly slashes the benefits from GHG reduction.
That created friction btw NHTSA, which had driver’s seat (yes, pun) on what had been a safety/tech regulation, and EPA, which came at the effort from an enviro perspective.		That tension still exists today, even in the Trump admin, as EPA had questioned NHTSA’s safety analysis.
Flip side, of course, is the Trump admin would argue the Obama admin put the thumb on the scale of climate.		Obama fuel rule was the first time EPA and NHTSA worked together on it, in the wake of Massachusetts v. EPA. So it was the first time GHGs were part of this discussion.
cost-benefit analyses are inherently political exercises. Govts try to game the operation to achieve preferred policy/ideological outcome.		Another case in point: Trump admin gutted social cost of carbon, so likely has underestimated health/climate costs of weaker fuel economy.
To be sure, NHTSA said revisions were ongoing and that the proposal would still “prevent thousands of on-road fatalities and injuries” compared to the Obama-level standards.		How much that changes from the original 12,700 avoided fatalities in the Trump proposal is uncertain.
Trump admin will ratchet down its forecast for avoided on-road fatalities in its move to soften Obama-era fuel economy rules.		The 1,000 avoided deaths per year was a major justification for the rule, but the methodology earned swift rebuke from experts.		https://t.co/5CI4QhQIhU

That is the human fingerprint. It’s come from land conversion, from agriculture, from fossil fuels, from industrialization. Yes, it’s come from human progress - but that also makes it undeniably human, as scientists have said.
It is surely true that the world has warmed in cycles. 		But here’s the key: when we look at the point in those cycles at where the Earth is at now - in terms of distance from the sun, tilt, etc. - our atmospheric CO2 levels are waaaay out of whack with what would be normal.
These are bad and misleading headlines, @yahoo.		What @realDonaldTrump said about climate change was climate denial, as @LesleyRStahl pointed out in intvw.

@jwalkenrdc All of this was reflected last week, too, in the Affordable Clean Energy proposal -- the Trump answer to the Clean Power Plan. 		The EPA said its power plant carbon emissions rule would result in 1,400 more premature deaths per year in 2030.

@jwalkenrdc Those changes would also come with the associated benefits to reducing pollution -- fewer asthma attacks, fewer missed days of school, increased productivity, etc.
@jwalkenrdc Opponents, though, note that these are not phantom benefits -- if a regulation of mercury means the reduction of coal-fired power (or installation of pollution-control technology), it will necessarily mean a reduction in associated pollutants.
@jwalkenrdc They say this would inflate the benefits of regulation when there are other statutes/standards for those other pollutants. Therefore, it's more proper to use those other statutes to directly regulate those other pollutants.
@jwalkenrdc The move follows on a theme from the Trump EPA - it is trying to ditch the counting of "co-benefits."		Basically, admin &amp; industry say it's improper to count reductions in pollution outside the intended regulatory target as a benefit of regulating.
EPA is reconsidering a power plant rule that limits toxic emissions.		Most power plants already comply with it. 		So what's the big deal? 		Conservatives say the last EPA improperly added benefits from regulation.		Others echo @jwalkenrdc		https://t.co/mLiBn8gmnx https://t.co/1HANg0kwsK

This is hardly my first rodeo in Appalachia, either. The above has always been true. 		It’s also true that there’s a real fear of coal going away — that’s something that can’t be easily waved away.
What people told me about how they feel about coal’s future, its environmental trade-offs &amp; consequences, the uncertainty &amp; anxiety about a life without coal is all far more nuanced than the stand-in spokespeople us Beltway reporters use to approximate these voices.
Everyone except the president seems to know coal’s long-term prospects are grim.		Even West Virginians. They just hope Trump can delay the decline.		I spoke to Mountain Staters as Trump held a rally there. Here’s what they had to say.		https://t.co/YLwe9esuzJ (OPEN LINK) https://t.co/WHPWSNkGO1

@jeffnesbit I don’t know if that’s necessarily fair - I think everyone, left, right and center, feels strongly about things that don’t affect them in a major way on an individual level.
@jeffnesbit No, at least nobody said that to me. I asked people whether they had any personal experience with illegal immigrants. The answer was usually no. They just wanted the laws enforced.

Trump says he talked about retraining coal miners on the campaign trail:		“These are big strong coal miners and they said, ‘Sir, we want to dig coal.’ And I agree with you!”
Trump says voting for Democrats means “voting for the party that really wants to destroy the coal industry.”
Trump rehashing what he said last week in a nod to the coal resilience argument his admin is pushing: 		“You can hurt those solar panels. You know what you can’t hurt? Coal. You can do whatever you want with coal.”
“We are putting out great coal miners back to work. Great people. Great people. Brave people - I don’t know how you do that.”
.@realDonaldTrump has taken the stage here in Charleston, WV. https://t.co/jUarXErIiB
Many, though, sound more like Kevin Busby, 40. 		“Being in West Virginia, we all have coal-mining roots. ... Coming from a coal-mining family, it will never be what it once was. With all that said, I have a father being denied to him what was promised by the UMWA.”
Steven Stratton, 39, has seen the industry’s revenues decline firsthand — he collects severance taxes for the state. His father and grandfather were miners.		“My dad told me he’d rather see me under a bridge than in a mine.”

That said, Charleston is more moderate. Many don’t support Trump.		Andrea Anderson, 37, said he “panders” to the state with boasts of reviving coal.		Mekell Golden, 49, works for health dept. She worries about state’s high asthma, cancer rates. “It’s scary living here.”
(Greg is actually 51.)
Convo I had w/ Greg Samples, 53, sums it up well. Worked construction on strip mines &amp; always had reservations about destroying mountains. Says climate is changing &amp; thinks “all this pollution” might play role. Knows coal won’t fully recover but thinks Trump can help.
Common thread from Trump supporters here in WV - they don’t think he can bring coal back, but they’re glad he’s trying. 		Some have voiced concerns about environmental consequences, but not to the point of eschewing coal.

Trump: “the assault on the American auto industry is over.”		Trump admin: Actually, our proposal is going to lower labor demand by 60,000 jobs compared to Obama		https://t.co/uvImKnhAay https://t.co/eyV7Ctduo5
And for all the labor gains under the Obama plan, Trump admin argued in analysis that aggressive targets force production of components that consumers haven’t asked for/make cars more expensive on the front end (even tho drivers spend less over long term bc of fuel savings).
That said, the mid-term evaluation of fuel rules existed for a reason. While some groups might not want to freeze standards at 2020 levels, as Trump is leaning toward doing, they note the out-year targets are “steep” and relaxing them might be necessary.
Again, different than sales pitch. Trump said this would better auto industry workers, many who supported him in 2016 in key Rust Belt states.		One analysis by @BGAlliance &amp; @NRDC showed MI, OH &amp; IN employ the most employees working on fuel efficiency components/parts.
That said, Trump administration notes the analysis wasn’t meant to analyze the entire labor market. It contends the economy overall will benefit from cheaper cars (claiming fuel efficiency made them too pricey) which will help get drivers into newer, safer models.
Manufacturing parts and components uses a lot of labor. Increasing standards means innovation will likely follow. Which means more production.		@UAW, the sector’s most powerful union, has opposed Trump’s plan to lower standards. Same w/ @steelworkers (which backs steel tariffs).
The Trump admin’s analysis on cutting fuel efficiency said auto workers would LOSE the equivalent of 60,000 jobs compared with Obama levels.		That’s a bit different than the sales pitch he’s been giving. 		https://t.co/1kOqKRnbxS ($) https://t.co/utyDCqNaqK

I would say this was a pretty shitty attempt at collusion (whatever the hell that means in this context) given the amount of criticism that piece received from climate activists, scientists and journalists (some of whom were THERE IN THE ROOM).
What was unique about the NYT Mag event was that it was about a unique story -- a 30,000 word opus on climate change, cover-to-cover. For an issue that gets comparatively little attention, it's a fairly significant deal. So they wanted a rollout. Fair!
Just for the record: I've attended a number of events hosted by media organizations that convene energy industry players, the media outfit's top brass and reporters. No one would ever allege that's collusion.

@EPA @NHTSAgov Of note: Fuel efficiency opponents for years argued it would make cars too light, so people in newer models would be at fatality risk in crashes with heavier, older cars.		Now they argue everyone should be in a new car bc they're safer, but fuel efficiency makes them too costly.

@EPA @NHTSAgov Wehrum explains that there's nothing locally that California experiences from greenhouse gas emissions than any other location experiences, given GHGs are a global problem unlike smog, which is local. Therefore, he doesn't think California's waiver should apply to GHGs.
@EPA @NHTSAgov Wehrum makes case for revoking California's ability to set stronger vehicle efficiency rules for GHGs.		“What we’re talking about here is something very different, we’re talking about greenhouse gases. We’re not talking about conventional pollutants like smog in Los Angeles.”
@EPA @NHTSAgov King says it would reduce societal costs by $500b.		Worth noting this is complicated math with a lot of assumptions baked in. 		Trump team, for example, has slashed social cost of carbon. Using Obama level would have estimated far greater public health, climate costs.
@EPA Holding fuel efficiency at 2020 levels would reduce average new vehicle cost $2,340, says @NHTSAgov's Heidi King.
@EPA EPA's preferred alternative is freezing standards at 2020 levels, though Wehrum notes there's a range of options.		“It’s important to remember this is just a proposed rule,” he says.

Such a great story by @KevinBogardus on @EPAAWheeler’s early days as a career @epa staffer.  https://t.co/SIJPSaYUOY
@climatemegan I have to admit that I might not have been the target audience since I knew the broader strokes. Thought the reporting that went into it that puts you in the room was great.
@climatemegan Yeah, I think there’s sprinkles of how challenging intl environmental policy-setting is throughout, but valid point.
Trump will claim higher vehicle fuel efficiency targets will kill more motorists while simultaneously lowering the public health and climate damage from burning more gasoline. But does he have a point? It depends on the math. W/ @scottpwaldman 		https://t.co/UdJ76Hai6x
So, yeah. Debate!
At the same time, since the story is fairly spatially and temporally focused on the US in the 1980s, there’s plenty of room to critique whether industry’s role should have been more prominent.
The journalist, @NathanielRich, said at an event last night that he wanted to focus on the role humans have played in failing to live up to this challenge. I think that’s a fair angle to take if you’ve ever paid any attending to international climate negotiations.
Fwiw, I’ve read all 30,000 words of this piece and thought it offered a nice bit of history. But I’ve also heard complaints that it minimizes the role the fossil fuel industry, GOP played in sowing climate doubt. https://t.co/eknIfzhmWo

It will be very interesting to see how those eco-right groups handle this proposal, if this draft largely mirrors the final version.
After covering the “eco-right” — center-right groups focused on climate change — for years, this is not how I expected the first GOP carbon tax proposal to look. 		It’s not revenue neutral. It doesn’t ditch regulations. Those are the 2 pillars of eco-right carbon tax idea.
A twist - it would pause climate regulations as long as carbon tax brings down emissions to (unspecified) levels. There’s check-in points to consider reinstating regs. 		Seems designed to attract Dems, enviros who have been loathe to give up GHG regs for a straight carbon tax.
70% of revenues would go to the Highway Trust Fund (it replaces gas tax, which hasn’t sufficiently financed highway fund). 10% for state grants for low-income residents. Other funding for coastal restoration, R&amp;D, etc.
Proposal is not revenue-neutral. Revenue neutrality has been a key element of center-right groups’ carbon tax ideas.

@MikeBastasch in a sense i feel there's already implicit recognition that costs would be passed on given part of revenues in curbelo proposal would go to low-income families who spend disproportionately more of their disposable income on energy.
@MikeBastasch my guess is they would almost entirely pass it on, but yes, a good point.
@MikeBastasch Indeed. But keep in mind that the way Scalise frames his idea of a carbon tax is far different than what center-right groups are floating. Scalise envisions revenue raiser for govt. Most serious ideas are revenue neutral (as would be Curbelo’s proposal).
Usual disclaimer- this is a draft bill and things could change. But I’m told the timing of the House resolution that says a carbon tax harms the economy (likely) coming to the floor this week is not coincidental.
Broad strokes of the bill: end the federal gasoline tax; impose a carbon fee on refiners; use revenues to fund infrastructure (think highways) and rebate low-income families disproportionately affected by higher energy costs.
That a Republican is prepping a bill to address climate change through a carbon tax is significant politically, even if it’s destined to go nowhere in this Congress. Shows some fissures in what has been an ironclad GOP resistance to take such steps.

ExxonMobil lobbied to kill a draft resolution at ALEC that challenged climate science. It was a bellwether for how large, public-facing companies are dealing w/ climate as GOP has become more hostile to enviro/climate. I wrote about that: https://t.co/ojFoSdl5pW
Story TK.
ExxonMobil spokesman Scott Silvestri tells me: "We review our memberships on an annual basis and this year have decided to discontinue our membership in ALEC, which expired at the end of June." He declined comment on whether climate change or carbon taxes factored into decision.
ExxonMobil was at odds w/ a draft ALEC resolution encouraging a review of the endangerment finding, which forms the legal underpinning for regulating greenhouse gas emissions. I wrote about that here: https://t.co/ruUAUaYLdR
This is quite significant given how much funding ExxonMobil has steered to ALEC.		ExxonMobil has publicly defended the Paris climate agreement and advocated for carbon taxes (though certainly hasn't lobbied for them).
EXXONMOBIL is leaving ALEC.		A statement from ALEC:	"[ALEC] values partnership with ExxonMobil and stakeholders across the business community. Organization government relations strategies change over time, and we have valued ExxonMobil’s work and leadership"

@JonCoppage @HirokoTabuchi 100%. i imagine same could be said for all infrastructure w/ sunk costs at this point (i.e. pipes for drinking water, natural gas distribution, etc.)
@HirokoTabuchi could make circular arguments all day. for many, it's an ideological opposition to government-funded transit projects (i.e. higher taxes). it begins and ends there. but if non-monetized externalities (pollution, congestion, etc.) aren't considered, no one's having the same convo.
@HirokoTabuchi ... the rapid rise of ride-sharing came with false claims of reducing traffic congestion. we know that hasn't been true. so to say ride-sharing is the future ignores the fact we'll probably have to innovate our way out of congestion. one way to do that? better public transit.
@HirokoTabuchi rail opponents (as noted in the story) have zeroed in on Uber, Lyft and self-driving cars as the future. it's true even in d.c. that Metro ridership is down - a combo btw bad delays from deferred maintenance and emergence of ride sharing. BUT...
@HirokoTabuchi there's reasons to distinguish unconnected light rail/street cars (i.e. DC's H St Streetcar) from actual metro systems (in DC, Chicago, NYC, etc). would be interested to know if public transit opponents make those distinctions.
@HirokoTabuchi that said, while many public transit projects are well-intentioned, having them just to have them doesn't make sense. Detroit's new Q Line collected $417k in fees in its first year and its 1.35m rides were 500,000 short of its mark. https://t.co/leqYbKSluo

@jpeebles I would gladly take an assignment there.
Will we be able to agree on how to right historical wrongs? Or will we even be able to recognize them when they’re staring us in the face? 		These questions animated the story. They’re  challenging, and I’m not sure they have concrete answers. But they’re worth exploring.
It’s also relevant today in the U.S. as our politics become more siloed &amp; partisan (through media, through demographics, through geography). If societies take two different paths, will we ever be able reconcile the widening chasms cultural and historical memory?
I wrote it when the debate over Confederate monuments was at a fever pitch in the U.S. These questions about how we grapple with our past, where certain groups in our society were greatly harmed by the abuses of the powerful, vex nations around the world.
The story uses Joseph Stalin as a jumping off point for a discussion on what certain people mean to certain groups in a society. There’s a monument in his hometown that’s basically a shrine to Stalin. It gives nary a mention to the millions he killed.
Wanted to re-up the story I did for @PacificStand on historical memory — it’s now outside the paywall and I think it’s especially relevant considering how NK’s human rights abuses went unmentioned at the Trump-Kim summit. 		https://t.co/fangujyZMk

Again - lots of voodoo economics with any cost-benefit analysis. I always take them with a grain of salt. But federal regulatory impact analyses have to stand up in court, too. So these are the most high stakes of cost-benefit analyses. Details on whatever emerges will matter.
Co-benefits emerged often in discussion of the Obama Clean Power Plan proposal. Opponents argued existing regulations already accounted for reductions in mercury &amp; other air pollutants, said EPA shouldn't count any reductions in those pollutants as a benefit for rule on GHGs.
A new rule, as sought by the administration's allies, would seek to restrict the counting of co-benefits. How that would be done is important. If it's too restrictive, it could undervalue threats to public health. But the devil will be in the details.
Here's why this action today matters: Conservatives &amp; industry want to eliminate counting of co-benefits (i.e., if a regulation aims to reduce GHGs, the concurrent reduction of hazardous air pollutants shouldn't count as a benefit). They claim co-benefits overstate reg benefits.
Federal agencies are supposed to be a tad more objective than interest groups. So far, the current EPA has caught a good amount of flak for shoddy analyses and assumptions about public health impacts from regs. Likewise, opponents of last EPA said it inflated benefits from regs.
To be sure, cost-benefit analyses can be configured to arrive at whatever conclusion you want. When was the last time you saw an enviro group- or industry group-funded study come out with an economic that doesn't support their policy objective?
EPA wants to change how it conducts cost-benefit analyses. 		https://t.co/yKD2QpBB2J		This could have major implications.

But farm-level data also is hard to come by. US ag doesn’t report its greenhouse gas emissions. So while EPA says ag contributes 9% of US emissions, that’s an estimate. Enviros say total is likely undercounted, especially considering amount of crops grown for animal feed.
One reason US beef is less of a climate negative: there’s less of an opportunity for deforestation if US ramps up beef production than if a country with weaker environmental laws - say, Brazil - were to meet China’s growing needs.
This assumes, of course, Chinese demand remains constant. The best thing for climate would be to reduce beef consumption/production.
Trump says China is going to buy more US ag goods. If China is going to satiate its growing appetite for beef, some say US meat might be a best-case scenario for climate https://t.co/sLx4NAdsdF

@toddneeleyDTN Ah, no - didn’t mean to imply that.
The Barrs have been recognized by numerous organizations for their environmental practices. Perdue also gave them a state environmental stewardship award in 2010. In 2003, he recommended Wanda Barrs for the state board of education.
Earl Barrs is a past president of the Georgia Forestry Association. He maxed out a donation to Perdue's 2006 gubernatorial election ($5K). He and his son own a commercial timber farm. The Barrs also run an LLC called Due South Investments -- its unclear what they invest in.
Pruitt and Wanda Barrs appeared together at last month's announcement in Georgia, a state that harvests more trees by volume than any other. Designating burning trees as carbon neutral -- which many scientists dispute -- would benefit the industry there.

@skerekes97 I get that. That said, Trump often criticized Obama golfing before/during campaign. Now Trump golfs at greater frequency than Obama. Is mentioning that the best use of media resources? No. But the press didn't create this narrative (lest we forget Fox's coverage of O golfing).
@skerekes97 I remember reading the depositions with committee staff re: Beale and writing stories. And honestly, the Le Dip story notes very clearly that, all things considered, the restaurant isn't terribly pricey compared to other options for high-end-style food in DC.
@skerekes97 John Beale was a much lower level public servant who was defrauding multiple administrations and DID receive coverage (the Washingtonian did a whole damn cover story on him). What I wish is that readers weren’t so selective about what they remember the press covering.

this @elainaplott scoop reinforces a dynamic that me, @nhheikkinen &amp; @rbravender reported today -- Scott Pruitt goes to bat for the aides he brought from Oklahoma, which is ruffling feathers at the EPA &amp; White House. https://t.co/GEHgGDZ7R8 https://t.co/uBNNrYpIz4
As the intrepid @KevinBogardus points out, there HAVE been death threats made against Scott Pruitt (chiefly, from someone who got a little too drunk while watching Rachel Maddow). https://t.co/Bj81fcbwe3
@PressSec @tamarakeithNPR More @PressSec on when WH review of Pruitt's actions will conclude: “Obviously we want to get through this process as quickly as we can but I'm not going to just make up a timeline here today.”
.@PressSec responding to @tamarakeithNPR's question about whether CoS John Kelly urged the firing of Scott Pruitt: "“I’m not going to get into private conversations.”
@PressSec @jdawsey1 More @PressSec, explaining @realDonaldTrump's Saturday tweet defending Pruitt's condo &amp; travel/security expenses: "He was referencing a report done by the EPA which we are continuing to review but in that it cites that the apartment was at market value.”
.@PressSec on @jdawsey1's question about reports showing no recorded death threats against Scott Pruitt (which he used to justify expanded security detail): "I can’t comment about police reports but I do know that there have been a number of questions raised.”

@EricLiptonNYT @danielle_ivory @CoralMDavenport @LFFriedman The quality of EPA's work on rolling back regs has irked the White House as well.

The bill would also make changes to a review process that determines how to compensate stakeholders for negative impacts to streams, wetlands and other aquatic resources from construction.
The proposal would also authorize obtaining right-of-way/property before feds complete an environmental review.
Another significant proposal allows agencies to basically borrow approved "categorical exclusions" from other agencies without a new rulemaking. Those categorical exclusions are actions exempted from environmental analyses.
In enviro permitting section, seeing lots of references to letting agencies focus on "their areas of special expertise." It's also the reason given for nixing EPA's ability to review enviro impact statements (bc the agency raises ?s outside its "special expertise")
Infrastructure week, the sequel https://t.co/7corPEB7l9
That said, a key innovation of the bill - agencies reviewing permits simultaneously instead of one after the other - has been sought by members of both parties.
WH says “core acts stay the same” for environment. But it is requesting statutory changes to permitting, so something will give.
Trump’s infrastructure bill would kill a provision that lets EPA review most environmental impact statements for major projects https://t.co/Y0K9rvwSTF ($) https://t.co/VHYxnfholM
Opponents of the plan, though, say this would reduce opportunities for public comment and sideline public health/enviro concerns.
The proposal largely shortens enviro reviews by requiring concurrent, rather than sequential, analyses by agencies with one agency taking the official lead. WH says this would reduce duplicative activity by letting lead agency w/ expertise pave the way.
BREAKING: Trump infrastructure proposals changes environmental review process to get major projects approved in under 2 years.
One major change: Infrastructure bill kills @EPA's ability to have final review of most environmental impact statements (Section 309 of Clean Air Act). Other statutory changes also part of proposal, but WH says "core acts remain the same."

FYI not to bury the lede but you're not going to hear anything about climate change or the Paris climate accord tonight.
White House will try to sweeten the pot for lawmakers on both sides of the aisle by expanding projects beyond roads and bridges in traditional infrastructure bill. The hope is this will generate a broad coalition to pass the bill.
Trump admin says it's foolish to think there can't be any changes to bedrock enviro laws that shorten permitting times. Enviros say it's foolish to think Trump &amp; GOP Congress won't go too far.
Trump begins comments on infrastructure, his top legislative push this year -- and a Trojan horse for slashing enviro regs, according to critics.
That said, many conservatives and industry found fault with how far Obama went and favor the action Trump has taken on energy. Interestingly, though, big multinational corporations that operate globally &amp; rely on brand reputation have resisted many Trump 	enviro rollbacks.
The Obama administration relied on executive orders to push its climate agenda given congressional gridlock. Endangerment finding &amp; court decisions said EPA must regulate greenhouse gases.
Those executive orders -- you guessed it -- can be reversed by the next president, just as he reversed many of Obama's (climate, environment and other) executive orders.
Trump touts eliminating regulations. Keep in mind, there is a process to ending regulations. Most of what Trump has done is reverse executive orders.

Er, the technology is called "carbon capture," and it's referred to as "clean coal."
Trump, though, will inaccurately call coal "clean." It is not. There is technology called "clean coal" that traps emissions and stores them before they reach the atmosphere. Many Ds &amp; Rs support it. Trump's FY18 budget request cut funding for that research.
One other major difference: Obama's environmental policies, largely through regulation, did adversely affect coal. It wasn't targeting coal necessarily -- coal has higher toxic air and carbon emissions than other energy forms -- but this fed the "War on Coal" narrative.
A major difference between Trump and Obama on energy is Trump will take credit for oil &amp; gas expansion. Obama wouldn't bc he valued his climate credentials but, at the same time, would tout low oil prices and benefited from economic lift of fracking boom.
Another thing Trump will say - that his regulatory rollbacks are boosting oil, gas and coal production.		What he won't tell you: While regulations may play some effect, markets are driving the energy boom. Oil is rebounding. Asian demand buoyed coal. Global demand bumped nat gas.
Trump during #SOTU will say his administration is overseeing an expansion of energy exports.		One thing he won't tell you: Obama signed the law to end a 40-year ban on oil exports &amp; cleared the path for natural gas exports.

@ConservativeLA this interesting thing is groups like Heritage, CATO, and ALEC opposed these tariffs because they weren't targeted. a 201 tariff is a blanket tariff rather than against one country, and this was technology agnostic. but yes, there's a whole bunch of policies in this pot.
@WillieYeatman could! who knows?
it was understood there would be a tariff (the U.S. International Trade Commission had recommended it unanimously) but where the admin was heading on the finer details were never well known by those outside the room.

@realDonaldTrump Trump repeated line popular among GOP  critics that China allowed to do nothing until 2030, essentially. Analysts largely praised China for coming to climate table, but some have questioned whether targets are much more than business as usual.
@realDonaldTrump That said, Russia had received criticism for setting its INDC target relative to 1990 levels, which Trump referenced.

@NavyYardPirate @drvox thanks! same to you!
@NavyYardPirate @drvox i think we've gone a little bit into nit-picking here, but points taken.
@NavyYardPirate @drvox and i note too that LCV has endorsed Collins. I think you're taking away what you want from this story, which is fine, but all the criticisms you've raised are covered in the story. https://t.co/F6b2EU6GWK https://t.co/RNblN57o8I
@NavyYardPirate @drvox i mean, that point is very clearly made, too. your takeaway is your takeaway. i don't come down on either side of this debate.
@NavyYardPirate @drvox anyway, there's some things out there. this wasn't meant to be empirical (journalism never is). but yes, one of the major criticisms is there hasn't been much substantive legislation.
@NavyYardPirate @drvox Many also point to the NDAA vote in which the caucus members voted to preserve the Pentagon climate threats study, though that's been covered elsewhere. There's been approps votes. Some voted against tax bill, tho can't say it was for ANWR solely.
@NavyYardPirate @drvox i mean, there's only so much space (in a story that was already so long most people wouldn't read to the end). there are examples of legislation (ie: https://t.co/E4bQZuATtK) but one of the points of the story is many enviros think there isn't enough.

@WillieYeatman @AriPeskoe i mean, i'm from the detroit area but i don't think i'm qualified to pitch china on F-150s. my point is only that this is generally something reserved for energy secretary, commerce secretary, etc. it's a new approach for an EPA admin.
@WillieYeatman @AriPeskoe Moniz was a nuclear physicist with subject-matter expertise whose department oversaw nuclear waste and had a shared (MIT) connection with Iran's negotiator. It's far different than Pruitt engaging in trade promotion/foreign policy as the nation's top environmental regulator.
@WillieYeatman @GinaEPA And it's possible the courts would have ruled against her and the @EPA on that. It's a straw man for what I was saying. There's no court that prevents Pruitt from doing this, but it's a clear departure from how predecessors approached the role in this respect.
