I spent 3 years of my life at MSNBC explaining all of this daily and wrote book explaining it in detail. I was so silly I thought they just didn’t understand. But they do and they don’t want it. It’s why I left to focus on direct action converting to modern resources.
Banking was an easy fix: clawbacks. Capital requirements. Retained risk. It could be done on 1 page. Healthcare easy: national health woth option to buy private services. Obama/Clinton/Pelosi/Schumer chose not to do any of this and opened door to hell with Trump.
Let me be clear Pelosi/Obama/Schumer/Clinton are terrible because they advanced this horrid healthcare law and covered up the financial crisis — which opened the door for Trump/GOP fascism.
So if you are saying Double premiums, people trapped in jobs, bankruptcy and most importantly total alienation of the electorate seeding the field for Trump was a better deal than nation healthcare with option to buy private services Im all ears. https://t.co/rX1wNv9gxO

She is probably the best of bad options to be speaker of the house right now tactically. But with a bar as low as Trump and the GOP that’s not saying much. https://t.co/LQABA4bxUl

Then why when the Ds control government do weapons, banks, pharma and private healthcare prosper? Clearly the Ds are lesser of 2 evils at the moment. But considering the opposition and the global climate and health stakes that’s not saying much https://t.co/UpGtTMpsgA
This is an agenda https://t.co/yk0QDa7rZh
Imagine the outcomes of anyone passed a national health care system like every other country. Even Rwanda now working on NHS. Imagine a war time economy to convert to 100 percent renewables right now? To avert climate disaster? https://t.co/imbgMiHYOq
Both sides are character assassins. Both sides are great at begging for money. Both sides are immoderate in all the worst ways and no one is stepping up to confront existential crisis for our kids with climate or for national healthcare etc. https://t.co/O3szPB3K4B
Facing an existential climate threat and the outrage of private health insurance extorting us I’d like to think we could do better than to desperately try to prevent more of this, but that’s our best option for now. https://t.co/qKLpAMQbZX
I never said anything about both sides. I said our entire political system selects for those who are best at character assassination, fund raising and extremism. And that rank voting, redistricting and donor caps change that selection system https://t.co/2srNKihGIS
It’s awfully hard to see in action though. :) https://t.co/VRAFyIGeSE
Hi Michael! What is the D agenda? https://t.co/MCAIPl24Os
@realDonaldTrump became president by not being Hillary. So many trump voters weren’t voting for Trump they were voting against establishment and Clinton Dynasty. Today it is folks voting D not because they believe in D’s but because they hope they aren’t as bad a Trump.
Case in point: How many people voting D today are really voting for a D agenda (whatever that is) and how many are simply voting in rejection of R refusal to slow @realDonaldTrump’s roll? Classic lesser of 2 evils.
It’s bigger than that even. We need to change the filtering system for candidate selection. Rank voting does this. Balanced districts and donor caps further moderate the filter to punish character assassins rather than reward them as we do now. https://t.co/lGlIwnS0nN
We control how we filter for political representation. Right now we use a lesser-of-2-evils system that incentivizes character assassination above all else. Maine shifted to rank voting to change their filter. The rest of the country should take note.
Only when we shift to rank voting, universal donor caps, will we start to select for other traits. Right now we have designed a system to identify the most extreme, best character assasins with a skill for money begging.
Our political system guarantees that our representatives are politically extreme, skilled character assassins/backstabbers who are good at begging for money. It is designed to filter for those 3 characteristics above all else and will be prevalent in all who win tonight.

This is not a typical time in US history. We have an ever-increasing dysfunction within our government while the economic and developmental shifts, globally, are faster than they have ever been. Maintaining the course as is presents an incredible risk!

Imagine being able to vote for the person you really want rather than having to choose between the lesser of two evils. What if you could rank candidates by your order of preference — as voters in Maine are now able to do — and vote for a third party candidate without votes
Imagine having open primaries which allow everyone to vote for the candidate they feel best represents them...The outcome of open primaries tends to be more of a reflection of the type of candidate that like-minded people want and prevent establishment candidates from dominating

Right. Now we are the major contributor of weapons to the region with zero strategy and an exploding humanitarian crisis/child murder. Either leave altogether (oil needs make that impossible) or invest in Safe Zones under Turkish/Jordanian leadership https://t.co/RRqkF9p7X3

By their very nature digital platforms are most valuable to all of us when they are monopolies. Key is to keep platforms and use anti-trust to shift ownership to broad base of network users over time — Incentive to abuse network control diminishes.
Anti-trust is the mechanism we have to intervene in any monopoly that naturally results from shift in infrastructure to global digital network. Massive value, bigger than rail. Also massive risk. Must preserve network value and shift to user/owners - network value is in user base https://t.co/f2XRwZU4rx
@realDonaldTrump should of be using anti-trust, not post office to help us shift to new world of open global network. Preserve network, open control to network users: @CNN tonight with @AC360 via Skype https://t.co/5KbEOVLUhR @matthewstoller

No one was coerced into using railroads. It revolutionized infrastructure. Same is true for Amazon/FB. Immense value shift and ultimately a terminal monopoly that must move to next phase as railroads did. Rather than “break-up” which destroys network shift to user/owners. https://t.co/Mi9lpEKO6D
We must use anti-trust law to shift away from centralized controls of supply chain and build the network while valuing the past 100 years of retail which set the table for this shift. https://t.co/Nw5vtSFnLX
La k of broadband in districts like #NY21 like so many rural districts across American is the equivalent of refusing to build roads and highways in these areas 100 years ago. A healthy version of these networks is our greatest tool for prosperity. Unhealthy versions destroy
I will be joining @AC360 around 930 eastern to discuss  @realDonaldTrump/Amazon and the Presidents uncanny ability to identify critical problems and offer misguided solutions. @CNN #wecanfixthis
Communication, economy and jobs all benefit from that shift. @realDonaldTrump is right to talk about tech monopolies. They need to shift to the next phase of their development to serve us. Targeting postal contracts is not the way to do that. Anti-trust law is.
Much like the railroads. Amazon &amp; Facebook have given us tools that changed the world forever. Now we simply must shift to recognize the value in these networks resides with the users. Anti-trust is the tool.
The irony of targeting the post office is that the idea of communication and creating a post office as a central foundation for that connection is in the Constitution.
Much as we had to move past a single railroad and oil company under Teddy Roosevelt now we must shift to distributed value to network users where the value resides using anti-trust
@realDonaldTrump should use anti-trust to shift owenership to all users and in the process eliminate chokepoint of small centralized owners used to extract from users, suppliers etc.
The world has shifted to global communication and connection and Amazon and Facebook are the new global grid. The value in these networks is the users but it is captured by the platform owners.
@realDonaldTrump is the master of identifying the right problems, sadly he comes with the wrong solutions. Amazon is one of a few massive tech monopolies that have revolutionized the way we live but need to shift away from centralized control as the railroads did.

As we shift to record voters intention rather than aversion with Rank Voting it changes political/campaign culture which  now prioritizes demonization of opponent as path to victory. Rank Voting changes that by reflecting voter intention not aversion. https://t.co/BXpUao2b5D
Or look at our race in NY-21. 7 great candidates. Rank vote all in primary 1-7. Easy to actually record voters true intent - Voting system is designed to deny that and encourage lesser or 2 evils voting mentality - Rank Vote fixes &amp; records voters intention rather than aversion. https://t.co/WdsfZHC4jt

This prevents obvious solutions like detaching jobs from healthcare from happening. Keeps people trapped at time we all need security and paths to adapt. Trapping people in jobs with healthcare is dangerous to our future. https://t.co/Uj4dYQP9Vv

Thoughts on POLITICAL REFORM 2018?                                   Overall we must address: Balanced Districts. Rank Voting. Distributed Campaign Finance. Ballot Access. This takes a look at finance... https://t.co/FgRNzg58ZT
Thank you for understanding that NOTHING gets done without political reform 1st. Gerrymandering has made districts political fiefdoms. We are asked to vote for people we never would with binary voting. No “none of the above” or rank choice voting allowed. The list goes on. https://t.co/Dgon5SvB1p

Incredible resources are devoted to keeping the political system unreformed. Millions are spent with lawyers working to keep people off ballots, keep people out of debates, and to prevent rank choice voting. Millions. https://t.co/j0k9ggK1Pb
NOTHING happens without political reform. I dedicated years of my life in journalism and as an author to understanding the corruption. Few understand exactly how broken our political system is. Or how it can be reformed. Without reform no good ideas will ever be implemented. https://t.co/j0k9ggK1Pb
I created getmoneyout. I built a list of more than 200k people and gave it to https://t.co/FpRw1ZQ4av. I worked to support rank choice voting on the ballot in Maine. These are the fundamentals. Our political system as it is is not designed to reveal and implement solutions. https://t.co/j0k9ggK1Pb
So many critical issues. Healthcare. Network access. JOBS. Nothing will get done-to help all of us-until we REFORM our political system (#NY21 is gerrymandered) $ in politics, voting systems- this is 1st step to address all our issues and implement obvious solutions you all have. https://t.co/j0k9ggK1Pb

It’s obvious the political system is broken. It doesn’t work to really solve our problems. Gerrymandered districts. Closed primaries. Lesser of 2 evils binary “voting” instead of rank choice or none of the above voting, debate access and concentrated money have made it so.
Yes!! This is the year we change. More candidates. 8 choices in our primary in #NY21 more voters (90% didn’t vote last midterm primary) and more small $. We are the ones who most have to engage to open fix this political system &amp; bring jobs to districts from coast-to-coast https://t.co/KTTHS0TQNf
Key is for everyone to give a little - this is the year everyone participates. More candidates. More voters. More small $$ to diversify the funding base! https://t.co/MlUYBRuXJB
I understand that. As you know 45% to 90% of us haven’t voted in direct objection to a political system that doesn’t work for the people. But that fact is we are arrogant wrong to do so. It’s clear the only path is total engagement by all. To vote &amp; to run!!! https://t.co/bb9p7Pr2Os

Being on the sidelines is no longer an option. I dedicated myself to building Helical Holdings, for veteran-run farms &amp; sustainable agriculture. I live true to values I learned growing up here. 	I’m Dylan from Saranac Lake, and I’m running for Congress: https://t.co/b0o66XGO12
I want to work for total security for Medicare and Medicaid.
This is a job that is about engaging and listening to the people of NY-21, and then bringing those ideas to the House of Representatives.
I’ve been thinking about this for years, as I’ve been watching the past few years become less and less serious. But I didn't want to run at the expense of the hydroponic farming business, and I didn't want to declare until I knew this wouldn’t affect the people working there.
My positions have been consistent throughout my entire career, which is, let’s be serious, have a serious conversation, and create real solutions.
My candidacy is for the Democratic nomination, for the issues that I stand for and that the party stands for. But at the end of the day I’m not running for a party, I’m running to make the leadership in our district and in America more serious.
Tax policy dictates the flow of money and resources in our economy. It is the most serious conversation we can have after talking about defense of our borders.
We just passed the least serious piece of tax legislation in American history. The government’s not serious, our politicians aren't serious, and that needs to change now.
I chose to resign from well paying, high profile jobs in 2009 and in 2012 because I objected to corruption - both financial and political. I made a hard choice that I believe in. It’s that integrity and willingness to stand up for what I believe in that I’ll take to Washington.
People are disgusted, but the indulgence of our disgust and the lack of leadership and seriousness in government, is something we can no longer allow. The risks to our country are they greatest they’ve ever been. But when the risks are high, the opportunity is equally high.
I’m running for Congress, but I’ve never voted in my life. I always thought the choices available didn't reflect the potential leadership for this country. I worked for truth via journalism, and small business via veteran run farms. I thought that was enough. I was wrong.
We’re running a different kind of campaign. I’m running for Congress in NY-21 as Dylan Ratigan from Saranac Lake. 	https://t.co/gOwkviPmkQ
Here’s how a congressional campaign works: Conduct a poll, and find out what the people are most afraid of, what they love. Raise money, hire producers, and make content to play on the emotions of voters to make your opponent look worse than you. I don’t have this privilege.
The question I’ve asked myself since my first days at St. Bernard’s Elementary, is “what am I going to do?” And it became clear to me at an early age that my obligation to myself was to do the best I possibly could with what I had, and to use my abilities to help people.

Agreed. It’s horrifying. I’m saying that #Catalonia best path is to continue to be creative vibrant economic leader in Europe. https://t.co/a30OMo9cwo
@bomber9996 I don’t think Catalonia has a real choice. Best available path is to continue to become the most creative and dynamic region in all of Europe. A healthy Europe is good for the world. A healthy EU is path of least resistance.
Despite recent challenges I have no doubt a stronger #Spain is the key to EU cohesion as Germany hides French weakness and France hides German strength. Berlin has power, Paris, culture but Barcelona is the clear creative capital of Europe.
Capitalism is intended to force enterprise to create value for people and society. It is always easier for enterprise to extract value by limiting choice. Too many businesses pay government to create rules that allow extraction because it’s easier. https://t.co/Jh7iEXOo86

@Change_The_Rule's success arguing to @OpenTheDebates is a big deal and could open a path to degrade the power of the 2 parties
For me I have found it best to find things to support rather than oppose, as the list of things to oppose is long and degrading.
This frustration is an ever building bomb, or if harnessed a rocket for massive political reform at the root
This means most likely outcome from @POTUS is more self-dealing and frustration while opposition simply try to lever resistance for power
@HillaryClinton would not have resolved the frustration either, rather she is the ultimate symbol of the systems arrogance.
It' s unlikely @POTUS and his party will resolve the pent-up frustration, they will likely exacerbate it. They simply leveraged it to win.
@BernieSanders success was fueled by the very same energy that ultimately elected @POTUS
The election of @POTUS is not an endorsement of President Trump, it is the cumulative rejection of the self-dealing by DNC/RNC for decades.
@billclinton trade/banking + GWB war/spending + @BarackObama bank/private health giveaway's set the table for massive 2016 rejection
Meanwhile US Healthcare reform came down to a forced mandate to buy overpriced private health insurance, rather than medicare for all.
The vast majority of American voters felt less and less connected to either party and increasingly frustrated..
Finally @BarackObama in 2009 oversaw the largest theft and cover up in history as the banks were bailed out with no strings attached
This was followed by huge spending and war under President Bush, a further betrayal of the American electorate. Building frustration...
Understand that @billclinton set in motion the financial and trade policies that ravaged the anti-establishment voters
@potus can be inflammatory, divisive and racist, and he can be charming, and welcoming.
1. @POTUS like all politicians, can not be judged by his words, they do not correlate to actions. Focus on policy not rhetoric.
