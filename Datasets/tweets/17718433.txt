Leaning toward Vegas now
For what it's worth, I was planning a "staycation" on Maui before May. Would have been my first voyage on Superferry ... which was a factor.
@nathankam Oooooo ... Now that's a drink that every Monday should end with
@aloha_aina Speaking as someone who's been blocked due to no action of my own, even I am impressed if you've managed to block yourself!
Headed to Foodland, then on home...

Adios, Cuauhtemoc! Just saw her depart.
@sethsimonds LOVED Chef-Boy-Ar-Dee's Spaghetti-Os.
From my window there's a cool view the tall ship Cuauhtemoc of Mexico looming over the Star of Honolulu at Aloha Tower. Nice!
@ddepledge Thanks for following. You put me over 100 followers. Break out the champagne!
Should be an interesting Pearl Harbor "2nd attack" article in The Honolulu Advertiser tomorrow. Be sure to check it out.
St. Patrick's Day is Tuesday. Anything happening in Chinatown?
About to check out Watchmen at Windward Mall. Loading up on popcorn and mochi crunch. Already went #1 ... long movie.
Oh What a Feeling, War and Peace, Dirtbag, What What in My Butt, No Name Brendon, and Beer Me Please eating pizza after Hash run.

Just ordered some pizza for the gang. Pizza Hut delivered lightning fast!
Just installed Twitbin add-on. Kewl...

Heading off to Junior Achievement Hawaii Business Hall of Fame dinner
@rsj456 what ( or who ) was I supposed to do?
Just waiting for my computer to shut down before finally leaving the office. For days!
Cats and dogs in Kaneohe. Going to make a break for the house soon from the car.
Spicy chicken wings from Dirty Lickins in Aiea are proof that God loves us.
Just got a 60-year-old photo of my grandfather as an Oahu Railroad engineer. Very cool. Mahalo, Bob Paoa. http://twitpic.com/1x5w8
Happy Aloha Friday, folks!
Oy, time for bed. Night...
How doing?
Thinking about getting one of those trendy burping worms as a pet. I hear Paris has one. I'll name him George (or her ... for DLM fans).
Headed home. Seriously hungry. I foresee steak in my future.
Pondering my next vacation. Considering Chicago, New Orleans or Vegas. Vegas room rates are ridiculous ... in a good, non-boggart way.
March already?! Start your Christmas shopping...
@hawaiiadobo, been wondering if I should have this growth checked:  http://twitpic.com/1qojf

Actually heard this today in line for malassadas: "It's good to know that even in an economic downturn, we still need our pastries."
At Agnes' Portuguese Bake Shop in Kailua picking up 2 dozen malassadas. Best malassadas this side of Gibraltar.
If a super computer asks you to play either chess or global thermal nuclear war, you say CHESS
A bowl of Lucky Charms and the fact that I'm taking off on Wednesday finally lured me outa bed the cold, cold morning.
G'night, folks! G'better, hiloprgal...
Setting up Twitter again to auto-update my Facebook ... which I'll probably regret.
@rsj456 I agree, pop-up ads just end up making me cut my time sort on the website that uses them
@p_dub And HIPA always has the best food of local gala dinners. And I've been to my share...
Ahhhh... Arrived at the office. Start your engines...
Driving over the Pali was spooky due to rain and low visibility. Drive safely, tweeps, arrive alive.

In Kailua
Time to get up. It's a day at the battleship Missouri.

Waiting for a reporter to arrive. La dee  da
In the office early. Busy day. Can't think of anything clever to say.

Late night. Just leaving office now. No slowdown for us...
@aloha_aina To be named later. Word is it will definitely be a Hawaii charity.
IMUA OBAMA collector's lapel pins selling on eBay and Amazon.com to benefit a Hawaii charity. Search IMUA OBAMA on either site.
Finished painting the wall from hell. Hurray! I'll never do high ceilings again. Time for a martini to enhance the fume effects.
@ErinMankins You show that dentist who's boss!
MAJOR snooze button morning. Was up late doing some interior painting. High ceilings are @&!#%!
Washed off all the paint, finally. Time for bed.
Bumped into brudda Dean, wife Kalei and offspring Kanalu at the shoppong center. That was random.
Just bought some Atrium White semigloss paint at City Mill. Super dealio! Now getting a long overdue haircut. Supercuts! Cause I'm a guy...
ZZZs beckon...
2009 has arrived. Time for all the Xmas decorations to go into hybernation. That includes you, lights-on-your-house-yearound man.
Mele Kalikimaka, y'all!
Breakfast consisted of cookies from @hawaiiadobo. Muchas gracias!
That and the antibiotics and Phenergan w/Codeine. Yes, @hiloprgal, I caved and went to the doc. This cough is going DOWN.
Natalie Cole singing "Merry Christmas to You" just got me in the Christmas spirit ‚Äî in the nick of time.
Enjoying a Sourdough Jack combo. Jo Archibald's favorite for edit sessions, if memory serves.
Ah, work sweet work. Two meetings this morning.
Time to get up. Snooze button wearing out.
Alas! Home in Kaneohe. Tea or sake? Which is best to help me finally shake this cough? Both!
Just leaving meeting now. Homeward bound.
At the office. Where the magic happens.
Wow! Took no prisoners at the mall. Almost all done with Xmas shopping. Getting a BBQ chicken plate as a reward. Xtra kim chee.
Headed out for some last-minute sniper shopping. Weapon of choice: VISA mileage card. Shock and awe, baby. Oh, peace and goodwill to all...
Estou a casa. Vog sucks.
Eu estou no Che Pasta.
Eu sou feito com trabalho. Hora de beber muito alcholol.
Eu decidi actualizar hoje meu status no portugu√™s para o descanso do dia.
Pondering the big questions ... Like what to eat for lunch?
Well hello, Friday. I've been waiting all week for you.
Time for bed ... Got Cision training early tomorrow. Will need to get coffee first. @hiloprgal coffee?
Artist Wyland spotted at benefit dinner for Next Step Shelter tonight at Yacht Harbor Tower.
Heading off to volunteer at a benefit dinner for Next Step Shelter. Mahalo to eRealty Companies for sponsoring it at the Yatch Harbor Tower.
Spicy ahi today. Fort Street Mall.
Slooowwwly getting up... Developing...
I really like how Bishop Square wraps all the trees in lights. I wonder if the trees think they're on fire.
Sneezy morning. Vog? Weather? Someone talking about me? Good things I hope.
Wondering where I can get a dozen ping pong paddles
Left work a Scrooge. After walk thru Xmas tree-lit Bishop Sqr, now cheery. If I can only keep from being run over due to tweeting n walking.
Ugh ... time to leave the office. Again, when is it going to start slowing down for the Holidays?
Lines at post office were terrifying so nixed that. Lines at Mediterranian Cafe were not. Never got a chicken kabob plate quicker.
Off to post office chaos then to grab a bite. I'm thinking Greek.
Busy day yesterday. Starting on another. When's the Holiday slowdown going to happen? Guess I should count my blessings... 1, 2, 3...
Last full week of the year begins. Use up all remaining 2008 budget allotments now. Feel free to send unused to my PayPal account.
Time for bed. Last full week of work in 2008 begins tomorrow.
Congrats to all who finished the Honolulu Marathon today. And braved the rain...
Freaking cause it's 11 days to Xmas.
Staying dry, but trying to get "Dancing Queen" out of my head ‚Äî thanks to Lori Abe's cell phone ring tone.
Rain, rain go away...
Off to the Wilsons'. See ya soon, MWC PA peeps.
Okay, rain now hitting Kaneohe again.
@Melissa_Kim We closed the joint
Weather's just overcast in Kaneohe.
Coffee. Need coffee. Good thing I won the auction bid for a coffee basket yesterday.
@Melissa_Kim Wow, u guys go.
Arrived at home finally after a most righteous Anthology holiday party. I actually liked the fact that we held it at the offices.
Preparations for Anthology's Yule Store are looking good. Looking forward to it. Brought a check...
Doesn't seem to be working.
Testing my Twitter for Facebook.
Waiting for a client meeting to begin.  After that, day's pretty much shot.  Weekend almost here...
Yikes! Overslept. And today is half useless because the office party. Better get going.
Enjoying a Cinnabon at Windward Mall while I wait for Sears to finish with my car. Glad to be out of the rain. No power at home.
Very impressed iPhone added the ena in ma√±ana in my last text. I did it again!
Very happy I'm taking off tomorrow.
Forgot to mention; drinking a martini
At Level 4 listening to New Order, hiloprgal's fab song
Thinking 3 Star Cafe. May see pdub. No, not stalking.
@NathanKam See any golf clubs up there?
Oh, the weather outside is frightful...
TwitterFon seems to be working without crashing now. I like the interface better than Twitterrific - it's more like Twittedso-so.
@NathanKam Yes, very Poltergeist-esque
@NathanKam Aye, spore kitty and headless dude most spooky
Just got home. Going for a run, then a martini. Life's about balance.
Bumped into p_dub at Umeke. For faster service, get a sandwich or burger and go straight to the cashier.
Umeke for lunch
@hiloprgal My talent in Brown Bags was dance vs singing (Did I just admit that?)
Getting a late start today. Off to work...
Switched from TwitterFon to Twitterrific. We'll see how this goes.
Me me me me... Warming up the vocal cords for the inaugural "Anthology's Got Talent" competition this Friday.
Hawaiian Airlines just stopped by the office for some Christmas caroling. There're some great voices at Hawaiian.
Off to the HVCB luncheon at the Sheraton.
Southern style cheese straws rock! Colleague brought some back with her from vacation.
Arrived at the office, ready for another work week.
@NathanKam I stand corrected. I hope their coffee's good.
@hiloprgal Re: crashing issue on TwitterFon, go to: http://tinyurl.com/6aqzed
getting ready for the week. HVCB lunch is tomorrow at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. I love their coffee.
Twitterfon keeps shutting down on my iPhone. I think hiloprgal was also experiencing this. May switch apps.
@hiloprgal LOL. Yeah, but the jobs kinda 5-in-1.
back from Pearl Harbor. Met USS Missouri veterans Herb Fahr and Ernie Thompson on the battleship itself. Powerful stuff.
headed to Battleship Missouri Memorial to help dedicate "Crew's Room"
1) Morton's, 2) Longhi's at Ala Moana, 3) Doraku Sushi at Royal Hawaiian Center, 4) E&O at Ward Center, and 5) Outback Steakhouse ‚Äì Ilikai.
Top venues for professional association board meetings (to follow)
At home in Kaneohe.
@NathanKam Once walked away from a holiday party with a bag of of canned Spam. I was actually happy.
Success! That was easy. Up and out.
Trying to link Twitter and Facebook.
Nice restful day today. Considered and nixed heading to the Arizona ceremony tomorrow. 7 am is too early for a Sunday morning.
Pizza guy is back at Che Pasta!
@erikaengle Page says hello. She's one of the cool peeps
At Che Pasta for drinks with the cool peeps
Thinking Chili Dog w/Rice for lunch, from that shop in the BOH bldg. Ruth Ann Becker suggested it once 10 years back. Best deal downtown!
Starbuck's Spinach & Egg Sandwich rocks!
Rolling out late this morning. But hey, it's Friday AND it's the Xmas season. Joy the world, yadda yadda yadda...
Up but not for long
Blast! Got off on the wrong floor in the parking structure. At least I can walk and type.
Alas! Headed home. Long day. I hope 30 Rock is on tonight. Great show.
Mahalo, Tweeps. Keep em coming. I'll share a top 10 when pau.
Creating a list best places to hold informal board meetings, i.e., at Gordon Biersch, Aloha Tower (but bring shades if 5-6 pm). Ideas?
Headed to lunch at Mac Grill.
@p_dub spotted crossing Punchbowl
Thinking about getting rid of my shiny gold suit and matching shoes...
Weather must really be changing. hiloprgal had a grande nonfat HOT chai instead of an ICED.
Wearing my Macy's/NathanKam shirt today...
Star-Bulletin: "No Aloha for go! ... judge angrily rejects the planned settlement of the airlines' lawsuit" Ouch!
Arrived at work. Managed to leave Kaneohe by 6:30 am. Got to Downtown Honolulu in 30 minutes.
@hawaiiadobo Could be. Haven't been to ND in a while. Better try Dragon's. Unless u want to try O'Toole's
@hawaiiadobo Or jazz at The Dragon Upstairs
@hawaiiadobo Does Next Door still have Acid Wash Wednesdays? Nothing beats a little Men Without Hats and Martika to help you thru humpday.
@erikaengle LOL, fulfills the meat food group
@erikaengle I'm all about a balanced meal.
Martini Salad: 3 pts vodka + 1 pt vermouth, with 1 onion, 2 gorgonzola-stuffed olives, 1 pickled okra, 2 dilled green beans. It's healthy!
Headed home. No exciting restaurants, sorry to say. Feeling guilty about how much I spent in Vegas last month.
@Cherylc77 Did you know ‚ÄúMenchie‚Äù is a misnomer? Means a ‚Äúgenerous man." One of the creators thought it was a "blessing." Name stuck anyway.
Caved in. I when down to Jack in the Box and got a Sausage, Egg and Cheese Biscuit with hash browns and coffee. Mmmmm.
@p_dub Always do. By the way, have you read your MidWeek? It's a MO status meeting.
@hawaii Here's a good, somewhat obscure 80s flick:  April Fool's Day.  Very campy "horror" movie, but a great twist at the end.
Putting together a massive news media report for a client in the news. Lots of cut and paste.
@hawaii Two classics! Ahhh, the 80s...
In goes the olive,	Ice-cold liquid in clear glass,	Martini haiku
Highway lights still out on Pali. Spooky. Very 1980s. Maybe the state is waiting for an Xmas lighting ceremony.
It's dark. Time to go home. Taking laptop home, unfortunately.
I lied. Picked up 2 choice eggplant and bamboo at Yum Yum Tai. Good good deal for $4. And live up up to name.
Lunch time! Interview prep at 1. Need something quick. Sushi! I need more mercury in my diet.
Finally on the road headed to work. 'Twas a multi-snooze-button morning. At least Lori Abe brought donuts. Missing out, Melissa Kim.
Okay, so Marieta Vallesteros just scared the hell out of me by honking at me in the Bishop Parking structure. I'm no longer sleepy.
Okay, falling asleep at my desk.  Time to go home.  I'm outta here early (4:57 pm).  A full three minutes.
Looking forward to the perfect martini tonight:  Ice-cold vodka, touch of vermouth vapor, two olives ... and perhaps some picked okra.
VERY hungry.  Thinking Spicy Ahi Vegetable with mild dressing on Alakea. Yum.
Headed to the office early this morning with 2 hours sleep. Lots of news today.
I think I put on 10 pounds this weekend. 'Tis the season.
Home doing laundry for what will be a long, busy week.
Saw veteran TV news camaraman (Uncle) George Cabral at party. Son's a Navy diver. Very cool. Trying to think what movie that was with Cuba.
Arrived at big family Xmas party. Early this year. It's a pool party. Don't think they'll be much swimming. Raining in Kaneohe.
Alas, home. Night was odd mix of football, wasabe sinous arson, nephew hide-n-seek, Journey, and gumdrop thieving. To late to go into.
@hiloprgal 2lbs wasabi poke and 2lbs spicey tako from Foodland, Ewa Beach. Hungrrreee
Headed for Ewa Beach to the bro's house to watch the game. Need to pick up some poke somewhere in between.
"Aloha" also means "Hello ... I'm  going to take your identity after you're dead." Wasn't that a movie plot? Gasp! Go's a pod-airline!
Three parades today, each starting at 10 am. Great family events ... if you can find parking.
Headed to the office. Found it amusing Mr. Hankey gets a shout out in this morning's Star-Bulletin letter to the editor online comments.
Had the Eggplant Siciliana at Bravos. Very good but very spicy. Order an extra glass of water.
So if it's the Farrington Governors, will the Punahou Buffanblu soon be the Presidents? What do u think, P-Dub?
I don't like tv ads on the big screen at football games. Just my opinion.
Go Mules! Leilehua victorious over Kahuku.
Great news! The Xmas tree in Pauahi Tower is up. It's officially Xmas time!
Headed to Aloha Stadium to see my nephew play in the Leilehua vs. Kahuku matchup. Go Mules!
At the office. A little disappointed that the lobby Xmas tree isn't up yet. Usually signifies the beginning of XMAS TIME. Maybe tomorrow.
Leaving for work on Black Friday. Too bad I don't work on commission.
At home, recovering from a Portuguese-style Thanksgiving feast prepared by master chef brother-in-law Dr. Sousa. Pumpkin malassadas! Genius!
Yes, Keith DeMello is now a Twitterer. Just trying this out. And I promise not to refer to myself in third-person again.
