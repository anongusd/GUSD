Dear #GOP - The failure of Congress to act has consequences - this is a simple lesson. #ShouldHaveThoughtOfThatBefore http://t.co/XKs1DqOb
#GOP failure to compromise on revenue means they can’t protect both billionaires AND the Pentagon. Sorry, but #ItDoesntWorkThatWay
A fair & balanced approach would have avoided automatic #DefenseCuts, #GOP just now learning the #ConsequencesOfFailure
Rolling back defense cuts on the backs of workers is NOT a fair & balanced approach- its time GOP learns #FailureHasConsequences
#GOP is learning #CutsAreHard. It’s why I’ve worked toward a big, balanced compromise. But now #GOP just wants to protect special interests

Re #tax bill - It’s like #GOP thinks the wealthy don’t have enough money and struggling middle class families have too much.
$$$ added to the deficit from #tax bill will come out of the programs, like education, used to support our middle class families.
Important provisions for families in #tax bill but tragically held hostage by #GOP - giving away billions to Walmart heirs won't create jobs
