@KimmyQueen09 They came forward to stop a degenerate. The statute of limitations for civil action is also long over. There is literally nothing they can do besides what they did. There is nothing to "keep at" unless they are trying to write a book or buy a stupid pink hat to "resist".

@MurphySanjay @ctLikeAMan @FDRLST His insurance company isn't helping with one treatment. If that's the extent of his health needs, then he's a lucky man.
@MurphySanjay @ctLikeAMan @FDRLST I'm not trying to be contrary but without ACA this dude is just going on disability to be another Medicaid burden.
@MurphySanjay @ctLikeAMan @FDRLST Let me ask this: tell me in real terms what he could get without ACA that would be better because so far I don't see anything.
@MurphySanjay @ctLikeAMan @FDRLST Bc his back is a pre-existing condition and nobody will cover it without ACA requiring it. Repeal means he gets nothing. Fix it so he will!
@MurphySanjay @ctLikeAMan @FDRLST So you think that without insurance altogether he'll be better off?
@MurphySanjay @ctLikeAMan @FDRLST What do you mean? It doesn't matter. With a pre-existing condition if ACA is repealed nobody will insure him now.
@MurphySanjay @ctLikeAMan @FDRLST I'm not saying ACA isn't deeply flawed, just that getting rid of it won't help this man at all.
@MurphySanjay @ctLikeAMan @FDRLST Without Obamacare, he would not get any coverage. You think repealing ACA means he gets his surgery?
@MurphySanjay @ctLikeAMan @FDRLST His previous Obamacare insurer, yes.

@GaelenSchumann @imacdowell @baseballcrank Anyway, I'm certainly willing to concede the issue is more nuanced than "illegal" implies, but far less nuanced than "undocumented" implies.
@GaelenSchumann @imacdowell @baseballcrank Only if you are trying to obfuscate. Something against civil law is still illegal. It doesn't have to carry a criminal penalty.
@GaelenSchumann @imacdowell @baseballcrank Really? So all those civil penalties for visa overstays are just whimsical? "Illegal" doesn't mean "something you go to jail for."
@imacdowell @GaelenSchumann @baseballcrank Straw man anyway: the issue is not people who accidentally overstay their visa, it's those who willfully choose to ignore US law.
@imacdowell @GaelenSchumann @baseballcrank No. You are trying to play word games. Nobody is discussing American citizens improperly documented. It is foreign nationals here illegally.
@GaelenSchumann @imacdowell @baseballcrank Being in the United States without authorization is absolutely a federal crime per 8 U.S. Code § 1325, punishable by prison time.
@imacdowell @baseballcrank So people who trespass on my property are simply undocumented house guests? They came illegally not due to clerical error. Euphemism games.
