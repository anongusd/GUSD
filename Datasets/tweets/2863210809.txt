There is no doubt in my mind that Judge Kavanaugh will do exactly what he said he would do: ‚ÄúPreserve the Constitution of the United States &amp; the American rule of law.‚Äù
This has proven to be a tumultuous time in Washington. Despite partisan attempts to assassinate Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs character, it is encouraging the United States Senate acted decisively about the future of our nation‚Äôs highest court.

I have twice reviewed the supplemental FBI report on Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs background &amp; the allegations. There is still no corroborating evidence for the accusations made against Judge Kavanaugh. It‚Äôs time to vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court.
Senate Democrats have said of Judge Kavanaugh: 	He‚Äôs ‚Äúyour worst nightmare.‚Äù	He ‚Äúwants to pave the path to tyranny.‚Äù	His confirmation would mean ‚Äúthe destruction of the Constitution.‚Äù		They are clearly willing to say or do anything to stop President Trump‚Äôs agenda &amp; his nominees.
One of my Democrat colleagues has urged people to, ‚Äúget up in the face of some Congresspeople.‚Äù 		Others want to see ‚Äúuprisings‚Äù &amp; have encouraged harassment.

Now that the committee has voted to move this nomination forward, it is time to take a vote before the full Senate. It is time to put the Democrats‚Äô partisan delays behind us. It is time to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court.
Shame on the United States Senate if it puts political interest before its constitutional responsibility. In America, the presumption of innocence until proven guilty is a cornerstone of our democracy. That‚Äôs at the heart of what makes our country exceptional.
It is clear that Senate Democrats‚Äô demands for an FBI investigation are nothing more than an orchestrated effort to cause a delay and push this decision past the election in November.
When @ChuckGrassley learned of Dr. Ford‚Äôs letter in the media, he quickly instituted a full committee investigation. Since then, the Democratic members of the committee chose not to participate.
If Senate Democrats really wanted to get at the truth, they would have immediately provided the information that only they received to the FBI &amp; @senjudiciary. Instead, Senator Feinstein held onto Dr. Ford‚Äôs letter for 6 weeks before it was leaked to the press.
While Democrats continue to clamor for further FBI investigation, let‚Äôs look at what happened. To date, Judge Kavanaugh has been thoroughly investigated by the FBI 6 times, which is more than any other Supreme Court nominee in history.
Judge Kavanaugh has been consistent &amp; categorical in his denial. While Dr. Ford identified 3 witnesses, each of these witnesses stated under penalty of perjury that the events did not occur, which further corroborates Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs testimony.
No corroborating evidence has been presented to support these accusations.
In yesterday‚Äôs hearing, we heard directly from both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh. 		Here is what we know:
It is time to put the Democrats‚Äô partisan delays behind us. 		It is time to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court. https://t.co/WjQDq0R5fQ

We need a politically neutral platform to fund the government on time, every year. We need real consequences for Members of Congress if they don‚Äôt get the job done.
There is a different way to get results. That's why I‚Äôve been working closely w/ Republicans &amp; Democrats to completely change Washington's budget process.
This failure only further exposes the underlying problems w/ Washington‚Äôs current budget process.
Some Senators are already patting themselves on the back for partially funding the government. In the real world, you are held accountable to complete the job.
We had the opportunity to fully fund the government on time for the 1st time in 22 years. Instead of getting it all done, Congress threw in the towel &amp; used a short-term continuing resolution. This is unacceptable.

We still have 271 nominations to confirm, and we must complete the appropriations process before September 30. @POTUS was clear when he said he will not sign another last-minute omnibus spending bill again. We should not go home until we have completed our work.
Senate Republicans have accomplished a great deal this year, but more needs to be done. That‚Äôs why it is encouraging that Leader McConnell took our concerns into consideration.
Congress should work nights, weekends, &amp; through the August recess if necessary to break through gridlock, confirm @POTUS‚Äô team, &amp; fund the gov‚Äôt on time. #MakeCongressWorkAgain
Congress has 54 working days until the fiscal year ends. If Washington doesn‚Äôt act now, the cycle of last-minute funding bills to keep the lights on will continue, while a few politicians get in a room &amp; decide how to spend a trillion dollars.

It‚Äôs about time politicians get serious about balancing the budget w/o any gimmicks. But let‚Äôs not kid ourselves. Passing a Balanced Budget Amendment alone will not solve our country‚Äôs debt crisis. We won‚Äôt solve the debt crisis unless &amp; until we fix our broken budget process.

The larger problem here is Washington's budget process has failed AGAIN. It is imperative the newly formed Joint Select Committee change the budget process to address the structural problems that lead to this unacceptable outcome.
This spending bill is not a product that represents everybody. It‚Äôs a product written by a few politicians who got in a room and decided how to spend a trillion dollars. The result is a massive spending package projected to increase the federal debt by another trillion dollars.
I oppose this massive spending bill. Washington has reached a new low. We are 6 months into this fiscal year and just now voting on funding for the remainder of it. Not to mention, this is after TWO shutdowns and FIVE continuing resolutions. This is beyond pathetic.

4) Free trade is critical but it must also be fair. @POTUS made it clear he wants a level playing field for American workers &amp; businesses.
3) @POTUS made a career of finishing projects on time &amp; under budget. He‚Äôs going to bring the same track record of success to rebuilding our country‚Äôs infrastructure.
2) @POTUS campaigned &amp; won on fixing our immigration system, &amp; he is showing real leadership to get it done.
@POTUS 1) The agenda is working. As a result of historic tax cuts &amp; regulatory relief, companies are creating new jobs, pumping money into the economy, &amp; investing in America. PLUS, 3M+ Americans are receiving a bonus or wage increase. This is the beginning of a real turnaround.

Any DACA solution must, among other things, include an end to chain migration, which is one of the biggest problems in our immigration system today. Read more in my op-ed w/ @ChuckGrassley &amp; @SenTomCotton: https://t.co/6icGjofeCp
If we don't actually solve what created this DACA situation, we're going to be right back here in a few years and that's the problem I have with this so-called Graham-Durbin proposal.
DACA and funding the federal government are two seperate issues. They have nothing to do with each other and should not be tied together. I'm shocked Democrats are advocating for shutting down the government over this. It is no way to govern.
It is absolutely ridiculous that we're in the fourth month of this fiscal year-- in the middle of January-- and we still haven‚Äôt funded the government for the balance of the year. No other entity that I know of can do this except the United States federal government.
I've said it before and I'll say it again on the Senate floor in few minutes: The President has been consistent ‚Äì Any solution on DACA must include border security and a WALL, END chain migration, and ELIMINATE the visa lottery. 		Watch live here: https://t.co/IettNM8qZQ

President Trump is moving at a business pace, not a bureaucratic pace. The American people expect Congress to do the same.
.@SenJohnKennedy: Changing the tax code is about letting you keep more of your hard-earned dollars.
.@SenatorRounds: To tackle the national debt, we've got to grow the economy. That's what changing the tax code will do.
Simplifying the individual code = relief to working Americans &amp; their families &amp; could mean a $4-9k increase in wage &amp; salary income.
