Cohen says "I do not" have direct evidence that Trump or campaign colluded with Russia. But he says "I have my suspicions," and explains how he thought he may have heard Don Jr telling Trump about the Trump Tower meeting ahead of time
Cohen walks through how he received payments from Trump, Don Jr. and Trump Org's Allen Weisselberg. "The President of the United States thus wrote a personal check for the payment of hush money as part of a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws," Cohen says
Speaking deliberately for effect, Cohen says: "For the record: Individual No. 1 is President Donald J. Trump.”

-- Graham also said Barr explained that his memo criticizing the Mueller investigation was written because he was concerned about the precedent of obstruction of justice and the firing of politics appointees.
More Graham:		-- Barr told him that he would follow procedure while "erring on the side of transparency" about sharing Mueller's final report with Congress and the public
Graham says after meeting Barr that Barr pledged not to interfere in Mueller probe. 		"He has no reason for Mr. Mueller to stop doing his job and is committed to letting Mr. Mueller finish his work," Graham said.

AND THAT'S A WRAP. 		Clocks in at nearly 10 hours.
In his closing statement, Goodlatte brings Strzok's not answering questions on advice of FBI counsel to Deputy AG Rosenstein. Who Rs have been threatening with contempt
Goodlatte and Jackson Lee the only two members in the room still besides Comer. The end is near.
It appears there's one more Republican (Comer) on deck and then we're done
Rep. Handel just suggested Strzok could run for Senate with his filibustering skills
Rep. Gomez says he's been watching this for the last "five hours." Five? Try 9+ hours
Strzok explains his "insurance policy" text as a debate about pace of the Russia investigation and a sensitive source...I think that was the first time he said that today but my brain is fried so I'm not certain
One more blowup between Rs and Ds. "You're out of order!" "No you're out of order!" (maybe the last today? maybe not?)
Nadler is back. Dunno if that's a sign we're nearing the end, but maybe?

Rep. Raskin just asked Strzok if Bruce Springsteen is part of a deep state conspiracy. Yup that's where we're at right now.

"You don't like Donald Trump do you?" asks Rep. Desjarlais.		"It's fair to say I'm not a fan, sir," Strzok said
And here was Strzok's response, with a lot of yelling and arguing in between: "The fact that you would question whether or not that was the sort of look I would engage with in a family member who I have acknowledged hurting, goes more to a discussion about your character..."
If you missed it, here's what Gohmert said: “I can’t help but wonder, when I see you looking there with a little smirk, how many times did you look so innocent into your wife’s eye and lie to her about Lisa Page?”
Things are tense in here
Now we're off the rails -- Democrats explode when Gohmert references Strzok's wife
Rep. Tom Rooney, a House Intel R who was heavily involved with those Russia interviews, has strolled up to this Strzok hearing. He's not on either committee -- he's hanging out on the Dem staff wall
"Oh Agent Strzok please!" Gowdy says when Strzok talks about impeachment. "Are you kidding?"
Jim Jordan is pressing Strzok about an email he wrote about the dossier, which he references "Corn and Simpson." Strozk says he cannot answer who the email is referencing, though he can say he didn't communicate with David Corn and Glenn Simpson
Rep. Cohen says Strzok deserves a purple heart, prompting some snickers from the GOP side of the room

Hearing is on break now for votes/lunch, back at 2. Can confirm it's a circus outside the hearing room too!
Rep. Jackson Lee is quick with the news -- she holds up an 8x11 of Manafort's new mug shot while questioning Strzok
Goodlatte presses Strzok to release his private texts to Congress (on personal not FBI phone), and he says he will not
Ratcliffe hammers Strzok for using FBI phone and time to send anti-Trump texts and arguing he left personal opinion at the door. "Agent Strzok, are you starting to understand why some folks out there don't believe a word you say?"
Rep. Gaetz proposes releasing the McCabe transcript, too. That interview took place in December, and also lasted many hours
We're still debating releasing the Strzok private interview transcript. The metabolism of this hearing has slowed...for now
Procedural observation: During the Rosenstein hearing, GOP jumped around with who was doing the questioning. This one is down the line on seniority. Issa, Chabot, Jordan next if that holds true
And order is restored to the world (but we'll probably still hear at least 5 other pronunciations at this hearing) https://t.co/dtkuS3gHZk
Who wants to bring lunch -- and dinner -- to the press corps? https://t.co/RlldFRnV9I
During this lengthy exchange about releasing the Strzok closed-door interview transcript, Goodlatte issues statement that Lisa Page will be coming for her closed-door interview tomorrow at 1:30 -- and mercifully that the interview will continue into Monday
By the way, we're only 4 members into a possible 74 members of questioning of Strzok. The rest of the committee members have a 5-minute time limit at least
Tweets have stopped while I've been writing but here's my best attempt to make sense of the Peter Strzok circus so far today, w/ @LauraAJarrett https://t.co/rjkbxnelxW

Before that, a testy exchange between Gowdy and Strzok https://t.co/cZog1u9Kqo
Strzok offers a vocal defense of his texts and his actions following Gowdy's questioning. Strzok says the "we'll stop" Trump text was in response to Trump's fight with the Kahn family
And we've devolved into fighting about procedure...there's a lotta members in here and it's getting testy
Goodlatte threatens Strzok with contempt if he doesn't answer the question. Nadler is trying to object, but Goodlatte isn't having it so far
And now we're fighting over whether Strzok can answer a question related to an ongoing investigation (Gowdy asked Strzok how many interviews he conducted the first week of the Russia investigation)
Gowdy vs. Strzok starts NOW
Strzok argues that his political opinions did not impact his professional actions, and he defends the Russia investigation. "This investigation is not politically motivated, it is not a witch hunt, it is not a hoax," he says
Ima let your signs finish, but the sage grouse signs are still the best signs that have been displayed in the HASC hearing room
Strzok is sworn in https://t.co/3aOFozBEi9
After some hubbub about the poster boards Cummings brought, he's now going through the Mueller guilty pleas. We're putting it about 11:15 for questions to start
Cummings has signs https://t.co/TTYMPMwSaD
Strzok not reacting from the witness table during Gowdy's opening statement, and taking a couple of notes
Gowdy's opening statement takes aim at Strzok, saying he has a "self-serving definition of bias." "He thinks talking about an insurance policy to keep someone from becoming president isn’t biased," Gowdy says
Nadler, in his opening statement, goes after GOP questions of Strzok during last month's closed hearing
Goodlatte in his opening statement defends his committee's investigation, asking Democrats: "Please replace Trump's name with your own" in Strzok's texts
And the Strzok hearing is underway!
It's 10:11. We're still waiting to start this hearing...Gowdy, Goodlatte and Nadler have not emerged yet from the ante room

The Rosenstein hearing is done, but there's more fireworks on tap for July: The committee is expected to request STRZOK testify publicly next month and to request a closed-door interview with PAGE, per a source familiar
Aaand that's a wrap for the Rosenstein-Wray bonanza. Clocks in just past 5.5 hours (with two breaks for votes)
Goodlatte ends the hearing by noting the hearing is approaching 5.5 hours with Rosenstein and Wray. "That's short by our standards" these days, he jokes
Wray: "I'm not really a Twitter guy"
RT @benyc: "I’m not aware of any disqualifying conflicts of interest," DAG Rod Rosenstein, just now, to the House Judiciary Committee. http…
RT @Olivia_Beavers: Rosenstein continues to fiercely defend DOJ, FBI to lawmakers: We are not in contempt of Congress, we are not going to…
Rosenstein said it would be a "dereliction of duty" for him to fail to approve a FISA warrant that was justified
Rosenstein asked if he's a Democrat: "I'm not a Democrat. And I'm not angry."
Rosenstein says that he found it "appropriate" that Mueller didn't quiz Strzok at length about this because the inspector general was already investigating Strzok and would be questioning him https://t.co/JT35WWR5IQ
We're back at House Judiciary, and the fireworks have already started yet again. Here's what happened during Round One https://t.co/7TN9HL5QhO
And the DOJ resolution passes 226 to 183, and one Republican voted present
We now take you to the House floor, where Republicans are voting on a resolution demanding Rosenstein fully comply with subpoenas, minutes after Rosenstein and Jordan clashed over the issue in the hearing
Whew, that was a jam-packed five minutes
LOTS of fireworks between Rosenstein and Jordan -- and a bunch of Democrats
Gowdy, who has long said he was a Mueller defender, takes his biggest shot yet at the special counsel probe at this hearing: "If you have evidence of wrongdoing by any member of the Trump campaign present it to the damn grand jury," Gowdy said. "Finish the hell up."
Gowdy is going off on Peter Strzok and his text messages -- and don't forget that Gowdy and Strzok spent roughly 11 hours together yesterday
Gaetz pressing Rosenstein on his signing of one of the FISA applications. Rosenstein says "I think it's highly highly unlikely" the inspector general finds any wrongdoing in his signing the FISA
DeSantis presses Rosenstein on the FBI's use of confidential sources to speak to Trump campaign officials. 		Sitting six feet away is Gowdy, who said after a Gang of Eight briefing on the matter that the FBI's use of confidential sources was appropriate
DeSantis presses Rosenstein on why he didn't recuse from the Mueller probe, and Rosenstein responds: If it were appropriate to recuse "I would be more than happy" to do so
FBI Director Wray says 880k documents have been turned over so far, and 100 staffers are working on fulfilling the remaining requests
Rosenstein in his opening statement: "As with most things in Washington, the real work is not done on television."
Rosenstein and Wray are sworn in https://t.co/9m2RQqN120

Markup update: The committee ruled a Rep. Jordan amdt out of order. Jordan called for a roll call vote to overturn chair ruling, though Goodlatte not in the room for this. GOP votes with Jordan 16-13, Goodlatte votes present, and the amendment is now in order. I think.
Some drama to start the House Judiciary markup 75 minutes late. GOP members were meeting for more than an hour, and Dems tried to walk out. But then Goodlatte and GOPers returned, a quorum was established, and we're underway
It's 10:38, and the markup scheduled for 10 a.m. still hasn't started yet. Most of the Republicans have yet to emerge in the hearing room, including Goodlatte, though a couple are now trickling out from the cloakroom

At the same time, Dems charge Gowdy has failed to hold the Trump administration accountable as chairman of House Oversight, and he's yet to issue a subpoena as chairman. 		Gowdy's response: "I know you guys like subpoenas because it's Latin for drama."
Gowdy, who has read classified docs for House Intel, has broken with Intel Chair Devin Nunes on several key points. And he voted "present" over a motion in the committee to try to hold Steve Bannon in contempt

One of the more notable conclusions of the House Intel GOP report was disputing the Intel Community's conclusion that Putin was helping Trump win. The final GOP report said that conclusion had "significant intelligence tradecraft failings."

Latest update on the Haspel hearing. More updating here as the hearing continues https://t.co/qfjZqPUh3Y
Haspel tells Sen. Heinrich that she would not have support today the destruction of the CIA interrogation tapes
Haspel defends her work for the CIA and the agency itself, saying the controversy over torture has "cast a shadow" over the CIA's work stopping al Qaeda after 9/11
Haspel tells Sen. Feinstein about destruction of CIA tapes: “I absolutely was an advocate, if we could within and conforming to US law, and if we could get policy concurrence to eliminate the security risk posed to our officers by those tapes."
"Haspel did not, however, say whether she believed the interrogation program under the Bush admin was "consistent with American values." She said that the country has "decided to hold ourselves to a stricter moral standard."
Haspel is pressed by Warner about whether she would defy an order from the President she found morally objectionable, and she says she would
Haspel explains in her own words the destruction of CIA interrogation tapes. She says she did not appear on them, and that CIA lawyers said "there was no legal requirement to retain the tapes" because there was a written record
Burr notes to senators that this is an open session, and says "every question" can be answered in closed session that will be after the public hearing
Haspel says "under my leadership, on my watch, CIA will not restart such a detention and interrogation program." Expect lots of questions on this point
Haspel says "I knew in my gut" on day of 9/11 attacks "that it was bin Laden"
Haspel points to her experience as a 33-year CIA veteran: "I know CIA like the back of my hand. I know them, I know the threats we face, and I know what we need to be successful in our mission."
Haspel's opening statement starts with her biography: "I don’t have any social media accounts, but otherwise I think you will find me to be a typical middle class American – one with a strong sense of right and wrong and one who loves this country."
Haspel is sworn in before giving her opening statement https://t.co/IBNJ4AqbMs

Gina Haspel is now acting director of the CIA, the agency says in a statement. I'm told this is allowed under the Vacancies Act b/c she was already deputy director, but if someone has a full explanation of the law I'm interested

In the Feb. 8 memo, Comey also recounts a conversation with Priebus, who asked Comey whether it was a “private conversation,” and asked “Do you have a FISA order on Mike Flynn?”
Comey also writes Trump says he had “serious reservations” about Flynn in their 1/28 conversation, and explained it about Flynn not telling him of a leader who had called him before Teresa May
Story filed and up soon, but here's some of the highlights: Comey writes that Trump said “the hookers thing is nonsense,” but then later said that “Putin had told him, ‘we have some of the most beautiful hookers in the world.’”

To recap today: 		-- DOJ says Cohen under criminal investigation	-- WSJ reports Cohen facilitated $1.6M payment	-- Trump pardons Scooter Libby	-- Ryan endorses McCarthy	-- DOJ IG report released on McCabe		And it's ONLY 4:20 pm on a Friday...
The IG report actually says that Comey and McCabe's statements were contradictory, which is one of the IG citations of McCabe lacking candor https://t.co/ZWYLykDSMv https://t.co/CkjLlbjUBg
DOJ Inspector General on McCabe cites "lack of candor" with Comey &amp; federal investigators -- more to come here on the 35-page IG report https://t.co/ZWYLykDSMv
McCabe attorney Michael Bromwich responds IG “utterly failed to support the decision to terminate Mr. McCabe.”		"We demonstrated that the charges were unsupported by the evidence and that the OIG's conclusions and the FBI-OPR proposal to terminate Mr. McCabe were unjustified."
DOJ IG: "We concluded that McCabe’s decision to confirm the existence of the CF Investigation ... in a manner designed to advance his personal interests at the expense of Department leadership, was clearly not within the public interest exception."
NEW: DOJ IG report says McCabe "lacked candor" in four cases and was not authorized to disclose existence of Clinton email investigation because it was not within DOJ's "public interest" exemption, according to copy obtained by CNN

There's more here, including 26 recommendations ranging from FEC laws to the Logan Act https://t.co/MjjTSgNS0q
— "Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, now a CNN national security analyst, provided inconsistent testimony to the committee about his contacts with the media, including CNN."
— "Executive Branch officials did not notify the Trump campaign that members of the campaign were assessed to be potential counterintelligence concerns."
— "Christopher Steele’s information from Russian sources was provided directly to Fusion GPS and Perkins Coie and indirectly to the Clinton campaign."
— "The Intelligence Community Assessment judgements on Putin’s strategic intentions did not employ proper analytic tradecraft."
—"Carter Page did not travel to Moscow in July 2016 on behalf of the Trump campaign, but the committee is concerned about his seemingly incomplete accounts of his activity in Moscow."
— "General Flynn pleaded guilty to making a false statement to the Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding his December 2016 conversations with Ambassador Kislyak, even though the Federal Bureau of Investigation agents did not detect any deception during Flynn’s interview."
— "The committee found no evidence that President Trump’s pre-campaign business dealings formed the basis for collusion during the campaign." (Republicans have told us pre-campaign finances were outside the scope of their probe)
— "Possible Russian efforts to set up a 'back channel' with Trump associates after the election suggest the absence of collusion during the campaign, since the communication associated with collusion would have rendered such a 'back channel' unnecessary."
There are some interesting findings in here, including: 		— "The change in the Republican Party platform regarding Ukraine resulted in a stronger position against Russia, not a weaker one, and there is no evidence that Paul Manafort was involved."

@karoun You're right -- over/under is probably about 15 Russia questions
More Coats: "We expect Russia to continue using propaganda social media, false-flag personas, sympathetic spokesmen and other means to influence to try to build on its wide range of operations and exacerbate social and political fissures in the United States."
Coats says "there should be no doubt" that Russia views the 2018 US midterm elections as a target
Just noting: Coats is a former member of this committee
DNI Coats written statement is here https://t.co/EidJbNl8I2
Warner says he and Burr met with UK colleagues last week to talk about Russia social media activities
Warner ticks off three issues he thinks have a "broad bipartisan consensus" -- that Russia "engaged in a coordinated attack," the effort targeted 21 states' election systems and the effort used social media
Nothing from Burr on Russia election meddling in his opening statement. Warner, on the other hand...starts with Russian election interference

Still 6 minutes before February -- anyone else have news coming?
More: "The vote to release the memo was absolutely procedurally sound, and in accordance with House and Committee rules. To suggest otherwise is a bizarre distraction from the abuses detailed in the memo, which the public will hopefully soon be able to read for themselves."
Nunes spox Jack Langer responds to Schiff letter saying he is "complaining about minor edits to the memo, including grammatical fixes and two edits requested by the FBI and by the Minority themselves."
Reading between the lines of Schiff's letter, he's suggesting changes were made to the memo between the initial Jan 18 committee vote to share with full House and before Monday's vote to release publicly
Schiff accuses Nunes of altering FISA memo sent to White House for possible public release https://t.co/JNLidwNEMR
“It is now imperative that the Committee Majority immediately withdraw the document that it sent to the White House,” Schiff writes. “If the Majority remains intent on releasing its document to the public...it must hold a new vote to release to the public its modified document”
Another twist in the memo fight: Adam Schiff sends a letter charging that the House Intel Committee "transmitted to the White House an altered version of its classified document that is materially different than the version on which the Committee voted."

Schiff says Dems will prepare their own memo to counter Nunes memo. Here's what Rep. Conaway said Friday about that idea: "As a sense of fair play, if the Democrats wanted a memo of their own, then I think bring it and we’d vote to do what we’ve done on this one."
