@Luke_Basham_23 @Luke_Basham_23 She cleaned up the Bush administration's disastrous act and helped plant the seeds for Kerry.
@Luke_Basham_23 I agree. It was an awful mistake. But her impressive record as Secretary of State has led me to put faith in her judgement.
@Luke_Basham_23 mistakes with her votes. But she also has a strong record of productivity. San. can't purely use ex. action to pass policies
@Luke_Basham_23 Not as committed as Clinton. She's fought for smarter gun laws, year after year. Also not disputing that she's made (1/2)
@Luke_Basham_23 This doesn't come down to "which event killed more people." It comes down to the level of commitment for change NOW.
@Luke_Basham_23 This is a difference in ideology. Sanders calls for a massive overhaul of financial system,Clinton wants to make alterations
@Luke_Basham_23 U.S. has a huge problem w/mass violence. Our President needs to be unquestionably committed to stopping it.
@Luke_Basham_23 Interesting, seeing as Sanders just altered his stance on gun control this past month... https://t.co/iZOeABzO06
Sanders prioritizes the redefinition of progressivism. Clinton centers her arguments on the passage of feasible policy. #DemDebate
"I will not make promises I can't keep...A progressive makes progress, that's what I intend to do." Powerful Clinton opener #DemDebate
