@makeupbyno @amazingatheist @SilentEagle91 @howdareyouspeak So you say.		Yet, they aren't always right. And haven't been, especially in the political arena.		They weren't right in 2016. They weren't right in 2018. They aren't right in 2019.		The small sample size is not universally reflective of the whole. Not everyone takes them.
@makeupbyno @amazingatheist @SilentEagle91 @howdareyouspeak Again. You do not understand. The districts might cover a lot of land in order to balance populations throughout a state. It is so less populated areas aren't misrepresented by a larger metropolis nearby.
@makeupbyno @amazingatheist @SilentEagle91 @howdareyouspeak I asked for the cite because I needed to refute it.	I told you before you cited it that polls are not accurate reflections of our population.	Simply because of the small sample size and how many people live in the US.	Ive stated facts that prove polls aren't accurate.
@makeupbyno @SilentEagle91 @howdareyouspeak @amazingatheist No. I am not in favor of any group/mob rule, but that of the individual's rights and liberties.	Included in that is the free choice to pick my own healthcare, to pay for just my own healthcare, and not forcing anyone else to pay for my healthcare.
@makeupbyno @amazingatheist @SilentEagle91 @howdareyouspeak I have taken statistics. I know them well. They aren't an accurate predictor.	After the fact, stats work great, in hindsight of course.	But you are forgetting the human choice factor here.	It doesn't represent the majority. Only the majority of those that took the poll.
@makeupbyno @amazingatheist @SilentEagle91 @howdareyouspeak No	You don't understand the EC. Districts are drawn by populations over a given area. The vote goes to the winner of the popular vote in these districts.	It is more reflective of these populations because of population masses collected in metropolises that do not reflect everyone
@makeupbyno @amazingatheist @SilentEagle91 @howdareyouspeak Yeah, you seem to be walking around pecking at dirt a lot.
@makeupbyno @SilentEagle91 @howdareyouspeak @amazingatheist I do not. 	I say that the majority rule does not reflect the country as a whole.	You keep misquoting and misunderstanding.	You aren't very good at this.
@makeupbyno @amazingatheist @SilentEagle91 @howdareyouspeak No. He didn't cause the drug war directly and I didn't say that it did. His foreign policy launched American Imperialism throughout the 40s, 50s and beyond his years. Those policies heavily influenced the CIAs decisions to take over Central America and spurned the Drug War.
@makeupbyno @amazingatheist @SilentEagle91 @howdareyouspeak Again. No. Sorry. Polls are not broadly representative at all. This has been proven time and time again.	Especially not for a country of 320 million people.	Thats juat too small a sample.
@makeupbyno @amazingatheist @SilentEagle91 @howdareyouspeak It isn't minority rule.	The EC represents the majority rvote throughout ALL voting districts nationwide.	T won more than 2000 districts.	C won 80 something.	So what is minority rule in this situation?	Now apply that to your poll of a thousand people...
@makeupbyno @amazingatheist @SilentEagle91 @howdareyouspeak What facts?	I've got history on my side.		You have a Reuters poll that asked a thousand people about medicare for all.		So, what facts?
@makeupbyno @SilentEagle91 @howdareyouspeak @amazingatheist You have my argument completely wrong. I have never mentioned libertarianism.	I mention personal liberty versus government power (majority rule democracy).	So, when has mob rule been good for the People in the long run?
Yes. It is bad.		But who gave the Office that kind of power?		You and your party during the Obama administration.		Republicans during the Bush era.		Didn't think you'd lose the last presidential election, did you?	But it is too late because you won't give up YOUR power, will you? https://t.co/PnnHTruro8
@makeupbyno @SilentEagle91 @howdareyouspeak @amazingatheist Really?	You seem extremely upset for someone engaged in a discourse.	I disagree with you because history proves why your ideas are unhealthy, but you keep quoting a majority rule as somehow representative of the whole.
@makeupbyno @amazingatheist @SilentEagle91 @howdareyouspeak FDR is the reason behind expansive government that supported interventionalism that led to Vietnam and Korea, eventually the Drug War. 	The social programs he created were then abused and now we have a population dependent on Big Government and they can't get out from under it.
@makeupbyno @amazingatheist @SilentEagle91 @howdareyouspeak I wanted to know where you got the crazy idea that the poll represents the massive population of the United States.	The problem with polls are the sample sizes. Too small. You cannot say it represents 320m when only a thousand or more responded.
@makeupbyno @amazingatheist @SilentEagle91 @howdareyouspeak Again, these polls are a super small sample size. Even one that takes a few thousand out of an over all population of 320 million.
@makeupbyno @amazingatheist @SilentEagle91 @howdareyouspeak Except majority rule does not represent the individual. It represents the mob.	How can you not see that?	Where has mob rule been good for the People in the long run of history?	Can you not think further than tomorrow? For yourself?
@makeupbyno @amazingatheist @SilentEagle91 @howdareyouspeak Again. That 70% is NOT representative of the whole as it is an insanely small sample size that does not represent the whole of our country.
@makeupbyno @SilentEagle91 @howdareyouspeak @amazingatheist We've seen time and time again where mob rule takes society, where big government has oppressed its people.	Where do you think this precedent of 70% supporting more government involvement in your healthcare is going to lead?	What happened to costs after passing the ACA?
@makeupbyno @SilentEagle91 @howdareyouspeak @amazingatheist I am on topic.	You cannot follow logic.
@makeupbyno @amazingatheist @SilentEagle91 @howdareyouspeak Show me a point in History where big government has been good for the majority of people, let alone the minority.
@makeupbyno @amazingatheist @SilentEagle91 @howdareyouspeak And polls are not accurate because the sample sizes are extremely small and concentrated in echo chambers.	A vast majority do not concern themselves with taking, or reading, polls.
@makeupbyno @amazingatheist @SilentEagle91 @howdareyouspeak And CNBC is part of the media that keeps pushing polls. Pushing polls that said Clinton would win in a landslide. She lost battleground states Obama won easily. By popular vote throughout numerous districts in those states.

@makeupbyno @SilentEagle91 @howdareyouspeak @amazingatheist What poll? Where was this poll? I didn't take part in the poll.	Mob rule is tyranny. How are you this dense?	Individual rights are far more important than government rule. No one has a right to tell you how to live and have it enforced at gunpoint.
@makeupbyno @amazingatheist @SilentEagle91 @howdareyouspeak Funny. You have this arbitrary number you keep quoting and say that I don't care about representation.	When in fact, that is all I care about.	Majority rule is mob mentality and big government is bad historically for its oppressive nature.
@makeupbyno @amazingatheist @SilentEagle91 @howdareyouspeak I need a source for that 70%, or it is just a made up number.		And no, since the Constitution was drafted, we are a Constitutional Republic with democratic elemebts thqt allow us to vote for representatives that then vote on state and federal policy in our stead.

Mob rule is bad for the individual's personal rights and liberties.	Currently the 70% (you claim) want less rights and more government. Historically, that is bad news for the People.
@makeupbyno @amazingatheist @SilentEagle91 @howdareyouspeak It is. Because the majority (your 70%) want policies that give governmwnt more power over the individual.	Democracy is not undermined. We still have a Constitutional Republic. We are not a democracy, and shouldn't be.	Think about how government marginalized the minority before.

@makeupbyno @amazingatheist @SilentEagle91 @howdareyouspeak Where do you get 70% ?	That is a legit question.		And no. I am arguing that more federal and state power isn't good for the individual, whether they are the majority or minority. History shows this.	Big government is bad news.

Mob rule right now is Statist in nature. They want the Nanny State. Orwell predicted this and majority rule implements this.
@makeupbyno @SilentEagle91 @howdareyouspeak @amazingatheist No. I am saying the minority shouldn't have to bend to the majority. That is how we had slaves. That is why women didn't vote.	That is how we get CA state policies in the Midwest that don't work at that level (namely because they don't work at the CA level either).
@makeupbyno @SilentEagle91 @howdareyouspeak @amazingatheist No. You talk population. I talk actual voters who are voting
@makeupbyno @amazingatheist @SilentEagle91 @howdareyouspeak That is the point. It can be turned around on that, too. What is good for the majority isn't good for the individual so when the power scales tip, dangerous territory.
@rdavid_ross @amazingatheist @makeupbyno @SilentEagle91 @howdareyouspeak You think so?
@makeupbyno @SilentEagle91 @howdareyouspeak @amazingatheist And we have that representation through the House.	And equal representation through the Electoral College.	Last pres election, T won 1000+ districts while C won less than 100. Would it be fair to impose the majority districts with minority vote?
@makeupbyno @SilentEagle91 @howdareyouspeak @amazingatheist I am not talking about population.	I am talking about voters.	They hold a large enough stake of votes to turn the popular vote, deapite the overwhelming districts that vote otherwise.	Mob rule is anti-personal liberty. Especially if that mob votes to strengthen the State.
@amazingatheist @makeupbyno @SilentEagle91 @howdareyouspeak I'm sorry, but mob rule is regressive. What is good for the majority isn't always good for the individual (not for personal liberty, anyway).	Look at Twitter for a base comparison.
@makeupbyno @SilentEagle91 @howdareyouspeak @amazingatheist CA alone had more than 8 million people voting that turned the popular vote over last presidential election. Hence the electoral college to provide balance, or else, the mobs in CA, NY etc would decide federal positions and law. Does that sound fair? Who, then, gets marginalized?

The GDP under Obama saw its slowest growth in history.	The GDP is steadily rising at a faster rate now than it was in the last 8 years.	The economy (as Trump waved his magic wand) is FAR better. 20k+ points. More jobs coming in than expected. Lowest unemployment ever. https://t.co/sQVNkLpYzD
@Ben_Alpers @Purge99 @KennedyX8 @voxdotcom It does.	More jobs.	Lowest unemployment ever.	Rising wages/benefits.	How do you not see it?	Our poor are richer than half the world. Not in the best of conditions, but an economy like ours allows people to freely give thier income toward social issues w/o Gov force.
@Ben_Alpers @Purge99 @KennedyX8 @voxdotcom It wasn't more socialist at all. It was less regulated. Less taxed. And a lot more focused on raw materials rather than consumerism. That is why it was better. The middle class thrived during the age of production.
@Ben_Alpers @Purge99 @KennedyX8 @voxdotcom A market that isn't heavy handed and regulated by government.	Small business is hampered by regulations on fees, licenses, taxes, wage demands. And all of that comes before the doors even open.
@Ben_Alpers @Purge99 @KennedyX8 @voxdotcom Again, their "wealth" is tied to the profits of their companies and investments.	Their cash on hand is their wage. CEOs make a wage, and are given supplemental incentives to running the company, including massives shares in investments.
@Ben_Alpers @Purge99 @KennedyX8 @voxdotcom This comes from the idea that wealth is somehow finite.	It isn't.	One can create their own wealth independently through the creation of a good or service and creating the means of providing it to the public.
@Ben_Alpers @Purge99 @KennedyX8 @voxdotcom You know what does better for income inequality?	Free market capitalism.	It allows more people to create their own wealth and in turn create non-profits that help their poorer community members, without all the government red tape and mismanagement.
@Ben_Alpers @Purge99 @KennedyX8 @voxdotcom Ok. They make a wage. It just happens to be a lot higher for various reasons. Their "wealth" is tied into their business investments and isn't just cash on hand.	Secondly, have you seen the economy lately?	The only thing that scares me is how many tines the Fed Res raised rates.
@Ben_Alpers @Purge99 @KennedyX8 @voxdotcom How is that your money?	How is what my father made in his lifetime anybody else's concern?	What right do you think you possess to take away my father's hard earned income?
@Ben_Alpers @Purge99 @KennedyX8 @voxdotcom Because those of us that understand the economy know that rich people can move.	Poor people cannot.	When those rich people take their own money out of investments, jobs go away. Lay-offs occur. The economy tanks.
@Ben_Alpers @Purge99 @KennedyX8 @voxdotcom How do they not?	Their money invested in companies doesn't contribute to investments in the employee? No new hires? No raised wages? No new benefits?
@Ben_Alpers @Purge99 @KennedyX8 @voxdotcom Back when it was free and voluntary exchange of goods without taxation, sure.	And that drove the free market and guess what else? Labor costs that included wages.

@Azul_Azul @halhiraeth @voxdotcom Of those already working.
@Azul_Azul @PhilipFogg71 @voxdotcom Where does it come from?	Finland taxes its people at nearly 70% of their income. Inflation is driven up because of Gov involvement. 	This was an experiment to ive them back their own money, but still from all of their taxes.

@zeno_e @ComicDaveSmith Um. Did you actually watch the whole video, or just cherry pick the parts that further your (wrong) narrative?
@Nalasnotnormal Yes. I agree. I hope the choice IS no, but this is an extremely rare occasion and an extremely delicate one for that matter.	I'm just saying it is a different circumstance in which I won't say the choice is wrong or right. That is my stance.	Any other circumstance: def wrong.
@DienamiteRedder @Nalasnotnormal Look. I am anti-abortion, but these are extremely rare circumstances in which I can identify with having any choice at all.	Under ANY other circumstance, abortion IS murder and IS wrong. This instance just feels quite a bit different than any other, to me.
It strikes me odd that Lefties think #ahandmaidstale is some kind of Christian dystopia while they openly promote Islam as an ideology we can co-exist with...
@Nalasnotnormal I am talking about the preceding traumatic event that created the situation.
@Nalasnotnormal Laws allow that choice, whether wrong or right.	In an ideal world, it shouldn't be a choice.	But, is it really wrong in this ultra-rare instance?
@Nalasnotnormal From your perspective, it might be. But think about the ordeal she has gone through physically and emotionally, and to have a child that might remind them of their attacker may not put them in the best frame of mind to carry to term, let alone possibly raise.
@Nalasnotnormal Kind of the choice part. That if I am not affected by it.	I realize the argument sounds like pro-choice, but the difference is the trauma the mother went through and the result of the attack.	This is the ONLY time I consider the "right" to choose outside of health issues.

I teach youth not to be victims and to take ownership over their thoughts and lives.
@clementsp92 @EbonyBreeCaple @truth7_truth @TalibKweli @smokeyblonde13 @Pauline46923974 Because I work in the inner-city. In the city. In an area that has a low socio-economic status. You forced a negative connotation to the area in which I work, without acknowledging what I told you I do.	You are ignoring facts to try and trap me or shape your narrative.
@clementsp92 @EbonyBreeCaple @truth7_truth @TalibKweli @smokeyblonde13 @Pauline46923974 You want to analyze where I work? Look at the demographics of people in San Francisco and see why I said inner-city youth. You made the assumption, correctly, that they are PoC, but you apply a negative connotation to it.	It happens to be where I work.
@Pauline46923974 @clementsp92 @EbonyBreeCaple @truth7_truth @TalibKweli @smokeyblonde13 Or folks who are very aware of real instances and see them all the time and actually help their communities resolve them get tired of people who simply point fingers and cry foul without actually proving anything racially motivated happened.
@clementsp92 @EbonyBreeCaple @truth7_truth @TalibKweli @smokeyblonde13 @Pauline46923974 The problem is when some people defend themselves and there isn't proof of such a claim made against them. Talib doesn't provide proof, and his followers don't care to see.
@clementsp92 @EbonyBreeCaple @truth7_truth @TalibKweli @smokeyblonde13 @Pauline46923974 Because the only thing he does doesn't help and detrqcts from his other work.	He calls people racists who probably aren't and doesn't defend his point or prove they are racists. He provides nothing new.	That is why.	The fact you can't see how that is not helpful is troubling.
@clementsp92 @EbonyBreeCaple @truth7_truth @TalibKweli @smokeyblonde13 @Pauline46923974 What Talib does can be dangerous as he simply labels everyone that dares disagree with him as racist. When they dare defend themselves, he says it over again without proving why. Then he says he doesn't have to.	Do you see a problem with that yet?
@clementsp92 @EbonyBreeCaple @truth7_truth @TalibKweli @smokeyblonde13 @Pauline46923974 I also feel entitled to step on this timeline because it is an open and public forum.

@DrSkipPhD @TalibKweli @smokeyblonde13 @Pauline46923974 No. I called Talib out for calling everyone that dared disagree with him, or to defend themselves, as racists is a dangerous way to operate because it undermines the real situations in which racism denegrades our society.

@DrSkipPhD @TalibKweli @smokeyblonde13 @Pauline46923974 You clearly don't understand burden of proof. You made the accusation.	A lot of PoC have been thrown in jail for flimsy accusations. A lot of people now are being thrown in twitter jail for mere accusations.

@DrSkipPhD @TalibKweli @smokeyblonde13 @Pauline46923974 Uh huh. Sure.	Blindly following someone and then attacking people who disagree or defend themselves isn't a problem then, is it?	Talib calls whomever he wants a racist. You all clap. They deny it, and he offers no further proof.
@EbonyBreeCaple @TalibKweli @riddlebr6 @smokeyblonde13 @Pauline46923974 Denying what?	I haven't been asked to deny anything.	I just keep making a point that calling everyone who disagrees with you or challenges your accusations a racist isn't helpful or intellectual.
@DrSkipPhD @TalibKweli @smokeyblonde13 @Pauline46923974 Really?	Which ones?
@EbonyBreeCaple @TalibKweli @smokeyblonde13 @Pauline46923974 That is a specific case that is totally race-fed. That is something we can fight with justice system reform and prison reform, which is something I advocate for here and in my personal life.
@clementsp92 @EbonyBreeCaple @truth7_truth @TalibKweli @smokeyblonde13 @Pauline46923974 It means I work in areas with people of all color and creed in the inner-city. What did you assume it meant?
@DrSkipPhD @TalibKweli @smokeyblonde13 @Pauline46923974 Riiiiiiiiiiiight....	Just keep walking with those blinders on thinking that.
@DrSkipPhD @TalibKweli @smokeyblonde13 @Pauline46923974 Except you don't know that I do, because you don't know me and you don't know what I do.
@EbonyBreeCaple @TalibKweli @smokeyblonde13 @Pauline46923974 No. Not at all.	He manufactures alot of outrage over things taken far out of context and promoted by media. 	It really can be a problem. Atereotyping and generalizations are a problem when white people describe black people, so why isn't it one in reverse?
@EbonyBreeCaple @clementsp92 @truth7_truth @TalibKweli @smokeyblonde13 @Pauline46923974 Which is why I call out the fake or pseudo-racist card pullings because it doesn't help and causes heaps of more division.	Talib isn't always concerned with what he does to people, who aren't all racists as he says they are.
@EbonyBreeCaple @clementsp92 @truth7_truth @TalibKweli @smokeyblonde13 @Pauline46923974 I don't have to ask how not to be racist. And I teach the same principle to my youth: judge a person by the content of their character and not the color of their skin.	I work with inner-city youth all the time. I hear their stories and we discuss them 1/
@EbonyBreeCaple @TalibKweli @riddlebr6 @smokeyblonde13 @Pauline46923974 My timeline is filled with such accusations from all people, left, right, black, white, etc, etc.	I call it out as much as I call out the false accusations.
@EbonyBreeCaple @TalibKweli @smokeyblonde13 @Pauline46923974 Think of all the innocent black men thrown in jail over a really race-driven lie.	Is it okay in any other form? To falsely accuse someone of something without proof?	If he makes the accusation, he owes the proof. That is how society functions.
@EbonyBreeCaple @TalibKweli @smokeyblonde13 @Pauline46923974 True enough.	But he calls out people who aren't necessarily involved, people who voice their opposition.	Talib made the accusation, the burden of proof falls on him.	In this day, with mob mentalities, accusation alone has ruined lives, whether the accusation was true or not.
@clementsp92 @truth7_truth @EbonyBreeCaple @TalibKweli @smokeyblonde13 @Pauline46923974 And when have I been a racist?	That is kind of the whole reason I @ him...
@clementsp92 @truth7_truth @EbonyBreeCaple @TalibKweli @smokeyblonde13 @Pauline46923974 He keeps retweeting me, so...
@EbonyBreeCaple @TalibKweli @riddlebr6 @smokeyblonde13 @Pauline46923974 Except if you aren't racist, the label is wrong.	In my case, I treat everyone as an individual, regardless of how they treat me.	Skin color, socio-economic status isn't some kind of pre-resiquite to talk, debate, have discourse, etc.	Calling everyone a racist for disagreement...?
@megarian87 @TalibKweli Thanks!
@EbonyBreeCaple @TalibKweli @smokeyblonde13 @Pauline46923974 Labels are dangerous, especially given out of context or as a balnket statement kind of generalization toward people that disagree.	Especially when mobs want people fired or jailed for saying something offensive. Or sometimes for not having said anything racist or offensive.
@EbonyBreeCaple @TalibKweli @riddlebr6 @smokeyblonde13 @Pauline46923974 No feelings hurt here.	You are doing the same thing I did.

@DrSkipPhD @TalibKweli @smokeyblonde13 @Pauline46923974 Calling everyone who disagrees with you is not intellectual or intelligent. Especially if people really aren't being racist in their disagreement of his presented information.
@DrSkipPhD @TalibKweli @smokeyblonde13 @Pauline46923974 I am not ignorant to people of any Creed, color, social class, etc. I pride myself on being in a position to affect positive change in my community by encouraging learning, personal responsibility, growth and discourse.
@DrSkipPhD @TalibKweli @smokeyblonde13 @Pauline46923974 All I've mentioned was his inability to counter argue and just cry racist in these responses.	My comment is on his lack of intelligence in response.
@princevimana @TalibKweli @smokeyblonde13 My point was the fact that he ONLY calls people racist, rather than back up his points any further.	That isn't intellectually honest. Especially not on a public forum that invites discourse.
@DrSkipPhD @TalibKweli @smokeyblonde13 @Pauline46923974 Except I gave him no such grounds to call me one, so, it really is him...
@DrSkipPhD @TalibKweli @smokeyblonde13 @Pauline46923974 I'm not saying he owes anyone a debate.	The point is that he posts on a public forum and only calls his dissenters racist.	That's not intellectual honesty.
@TalibKweli @smokeyblonde13 So how am I a racist now?	I just called you out for not arguing and calling everyone racist.	And then you called me racist with no grounds for doing so.	That is the point I was making.
@DrSkipPhD @TalibKweli @smokeyblonde13 @Pauline46923974 That's kind of the point. He doesn't debate. He calls everyone who disagrees with him racist and not worth his time. Yet he has no problem taking time to retweet them and call them racist, without a counter argument.
@iamjohnk @TalibKweli @smokeyblonde13 I'm not. I have a problem with all religions, as they are man-made and corrupt.	I also have a problem with a religious ideology that hasn't evolved over time to be less violent than the day it was invented.	BTW, this isn't racism. This is religion-ism.
@TalibKweli @smokeyblonde13 However, if you post on a public forum, expect people who disagree with you to respond. And perhaps instead of doing what you do, respond, in kind, that you are not going to debate, rather than simply calling everyone who happens to disagree with you that is white a racist.
@jcball @TalibKweli @smokeyblonde13 But if said someone isn't disrespectful, and Talib just calls them racist and says he will not debate a varifiably wrong data point, that isn't about respect at all.
@TalibKweli @smokeyblonde13 You do not seem to understand a large portion of the criticism people tweet at you.	It is all for the very reason you stated here.	You aren't debating or arguing.	You tweet. People counter tweet. And you rant and call them all racists.	That is the point.

@TalibKweli @smokeyblonde13 @Pauline46923974 That is deflection.	You comment on ppl you disagree with by calling them a Nazi and thrn you don't provide counter arguments.

@StationsTo_ @XamzaYasser @linderot97 The famine happened after.	Any community that experiences famine stores grain for... Guess it:	Another fucking famine.	Which wouldn't have happened if the commies didn't come, kill them, take their land, and not know how to farm.
@StationsTo_ @XamzaYasser @linderot97 So did Eastern Europe because the grain they were buying disappeared.	And there were no experienced farmers left to regrow crops.	So, tens of millions more died.	This isn't really complicated to understand, but you are in denial.
@StationsTo_ @XamzaYasser @linderot97 After they killed farmers for not becoming a part of the group, who hoarded the grain?	Stalin.	Government cats and military got fat while countrymen starved to death.
@StationsTo_ @XamzaYasser @linderot97 Do you not understand personal liberty? Property rights? Merchant rights to property? A free market?	They were not hoarding. They were farming and selling.	You could know that by the reaults of Stalin's murderous mobs.
@StationsTo_ @XamzaYasser @linderot97 Those were caused by natural events.	How daft are you that you can't lay blame on a government confiscating land and killing all their farmers as a leading cause of a famine that killed more people than all of the prior famines you mentioned?!

@XamzaYasser @StationsTo_ @linderot97 Of course. That is where the cascading failures of Stalin and communism merely began, leading to millions dead across the USSR and eastern Europe.

@TannhauserH @RoamingMil Can't believe 3 ppl liled this horseshit take. Even with "consent," having sex with a child is having sex with a child. 	They are not psychologically, emotionally, or physically mature enough for that to happen to them.	Ffs.

So, we've decided to just do away with healthy lifestyle promotion to make ppl feel better about being obese?	Cool. Now I bet you are going to tell me amoking doesn't actually cause cancer... https://t.co/421tlwibSb
End welfare. Restrict access, give it spending limits. Otherwise it is a burden on the tax payer, which means governmwnt needs to take more in taxes, to which ppl co tinue signing up for this program, which means more taxation, and the cycle keeps them poor. https://t.co/JXInrQiuSr

@MichaelScottQue @SilasHunter_ Clearly you don't pay attention. Libertarians never win because they keep calling each other out. Curse of the Party standards, I guess.	But ZERO libertarians ever want any government involved in business or personal matters. At least they agree on that. The difference comes in

@DavidErosenko @riceman79 @Octotron @sdibari99 @alllibertynews @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational The original, where it started, was illegal. According to law, nothing they collect should be used in court.	And again, the evidence is from people convicted of crimes unrelated to Trump, except in Cohen's case when he acted illegally. And ppl in those positions say anything.
@DavidErosenko @riceman79 @Octotron @sdibari99 @alllibertynews @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational Except they have by using fake dossier to acquire a secret warrant to spy on presidential candidate "for his protection."
@DavidErosenko @riceman79 @Octotron @sdibari99 @alllibertynews @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational And we have countered that point every time.	Because you need hard evidence.	It turns out that when someone is convicted of a crime, they'll say anythi g a prosecutor wants to hear. Without evidence, however, the claims just don't hold up for a DA.
@DavidErosenko @riceman79 @Octotron @sdibari99 @alllibertynews @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational You do know they were all buddies during the Obama admin?

@DavidErosenko @riceman79 @Octotron @sdibari99 @alllibertynews @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational Again. Without evidence to back up their claims, it isn't credible. These two were just pinched for personal felonies they committed.

@DavidErosenko @sdibari99 @riceman79 @Octotron @shelly2161 @alllibertynews @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational Then you weren't paying attention to your precious CNN or MSNBC and ilk.

@DavidErosenko @bsoldre @alllibertynews @riceman79 @Octotron @sdibari99 @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational Do you know Trump's intent?

@DavidErosenko @riceman79 @Octotron @sdibari99 @alllibertynews @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational No. It isn't. Because there becomes a distinction between campaign funds, which are kept separate from personal funds.

@DavidErosenko @Octotron @riceman79 @shelly2161 @alllibertynews @sdibari99 @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational Who declared that war?	Not Congress.	According to the Constitution, who has that single authority?
@DavidErosenko @riceman79 @shelly2161 @Octotron @alllibertynews @sdibari99 @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational What proof do you have that he is criminal?	And why are you ignoring the proof presented to you about previous administrations?
@DavidErosenko @riceman79 @Octotron @sdibari99 @alllibertynews @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational Again, proof?
@DavidErosenko @riceman79 @Octotron @shelly2161 @alllibertynews @sdibari99 @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational Did he though?	Do we have that evidence?	Do we believe the evidence our government presented ex post facto? 	Was there a trial?
@DavidErosenko @sdibari99 @shelly2161 @riceman79 @Octotron @alllibertynews @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational The FBI report released by Comey and his interview after releasing his report.
@DavidErosenko @riceman79 @Octotron @sdibari99 @alllibertynews @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational You do know who runs https://t.co/HD7a27j3R5, right? Please tell me you know...
@DavidErosenko @Octotron @riceman79 @shelly2161 @alllibertynews @sdibari99 @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational And what you know is biased and misleading, as we have pointed out.	We are not in war time. We are in peacetime. Confress has declared no war. Therefore, all these acts are illegal. Including the drone strike on an American citizen.
@DavidErosenko @riceman79 @Octotron @shelly2161 @alllibertynews @sdibari99 @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational Deep state. Focused on Trump.	Obama weaponized the Dom, the FBI, and the IRS in his tenure to beat the political opposition and failed miserably. But the deep state isn't gone yet.	I don't see how you cannot see this as a desperate power grab by the ruling elite...
@DavidErosenko @Octotron @riceman79 @shelly2161 @alllibertynews @sdibari99 @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational Wow. You miss the whole damn point. If the President declares you an enemy combatant, he can order a killstrike, without due process, regardless where you happen to be. That is illegal. That is the point.	We wouldn't know whether or not you were actually an enemy combatant.
@DavidErosenko @Octotron @sdibari99 @shelly2161 @riceman79 @alllibertynews @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational Again. Hush money isn't illegal. Not when privately funded. This is just a smear tactic bexause Trump, but will not bring about impeachment or criminal proceedings...
@DavidErosenko @riceman79 @Octotron @sdibari99 @alllibertynews @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational No. Privately funding a pay off for silence to avoid media scrutiny is not illegal.	Again, the Trump tower meeting wasn't an official visit with policy makers, therefore it wasn't illegal. Shady? Arguably so. But not illegal because they were not government officials.
@DavidErosenko @Octotron @riceman79 @shelly2161 @alllibertynews @sdibari99 @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational In an illegal war without due process. Therefore, it was illegal. You defend Obama's action without considering Trump could make the same determination about you.
@DavidErosenko @sdibari99 @Octotron @shelly2161 @riceman79 @alllibertynews @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational How is paying a porn star for silence about an affair going to influence an election?	That isn't influencing an election and isn't a felony. Especially when it was privately funded.	Now do Congress and tax payer money.
@DavidErosenko @Octotron @riceman79 @shelly2161 @alllibertynews @sdibari99 @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational In war time sure.	But who declared war?	Did Congress declare war?	No. Then it is an illegal war. Therefore, an illegal action.
@DavidErosenko @riceman79 @shelly2161 @Octotron @alllibertynews @sdibari99 @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational How do we know he was? Or the 16 year old kid?	And was what they were doing an imminent threat? How do we know?	Because Obama said so?
@DavidErosenko @Octotron @riceman79 @sdibari99 @alllibertynews @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational What pay off? To Stormy Daniels?	You know she has to pay Trump back and his legal fees, right?	What do you think that means?
@DavidErosenko @riceman79 @shelly2161 @Octotron @alllibertynews @sdibari99 @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational The fact there was no trial to prove he was an enemy combatant.
@DavidErosenko @riceman79 @shelly2161 @Octotron @alllibertynews @sdibari99 @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational So let me get this straight: you trusted the government Intel then but you rally against it now, because Trump. Yet you dismiss the corruption of the past administration (which info is available to the public) because of perceived corruption of Trump?
@DavidErosenko @sdibari99 @shelly2161 @riceman79 @Octotron @alllibertynews @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational She passed classified info. This was in Comey's report! He just decided not to press charges while shaking a finger and saying no one else better do it or he would charge them!
@DavidErosenko @Octotron @riceman79 @shelly2161 @alllibertynews @sdibari99 @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational Facts seem to change with you. You don't understand. How do we know he was actively involved and not coerced?	We don't. Bexause there was not trial.
@DavidErosenko @riceman79 @shelly2161 @Octotron @alllibertynews @sdibari99 @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational So? He was a citizen. 	I suppose you were against the torture of non-citizen terrorists in guantanamo. If not, then clearly you have wires all crisscrossed in your brain.
@DavidErosenko @riceman79 @Octotron @sdibari99 @alllibertynews @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational Like what? Name them.
@DavidErosenko @riceman79 @shelly2161 @Octotron @alllibertynews @sdibari99 @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational Jeezus. If you are an American, you still get Constitutional rights of due process. It is call extradition. They find you and bring you back.	Not assassinate you with a goddamned drone strike.
@DavidErosenko @sdibari99 @Octotron @shelly2161 @riceman79 @alllibertynews @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational Paying off porn stars isn't a felony. Using tax payer funds is. So let's look into that slush pile Congress uses to pay off these accusers.
@DavidErosenko @Octotron @riceman79 @shelly2161 @alllibertynews @sdibari99 @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational Yes. When a president orders the assassination of a US citizen, regardless of crimes committed and without due process (a right guaranteed to every citizen no matter where they happen to be sitting in the world).
@DavidErosenko @riceman79 @shelly2161 @Octotron @alllibertynews @sdibari99 @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational So. If the US government kills you in Iran, it would be legal?	WT actual F?!
@DavidErosenko @Octotron @riceman79 @sdibari99 @alllibertynews @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational No. He hasn't. He admitted to affair  pay offs. Which aren't illegal. Cohen admitted to felonies and is trying to cover his ass.
@DavidErosenko @riceman79 @shelly2161 @Octotron @alllibertynews @sdibari99 @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational So due process and the US legal system mean nothing. We can just trust what the government tells us about a person and their alleged crimes?	Makes sense since you deem Trump guilty.	However, this is completely illegal. As is Guantanamo.
@DavidErosenko @sdibari99 @shelly2161 @riceman79 @Octotron @alllibertynews @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational The difference is that Yvanka wasn't trading state secrets. Hillary was, as mentioned, to avoid FOIA
@DavidErosenko @Octotron @riceman79 @sdibari99 @alllibertynews @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational He hasn't admitted to felonies. Even your papers have mentioned this in their bi-lines.	He hasn't been convicted or charged of a crime. Therefore, he isn't yet a criminal.
@DavidErosenko @riceman79 @shelly2161 @Octotron @alllibertynews @sdibari99 @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational Yes. The strike was authorized with the President knowing he was present.
@DavidErosenko @riceman79 @Octotron @sdibari99 @alllibertynews @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational Known? No. You habe no proof and make erroneous claims that are mere speculation because we the People have not seen the evidence yet. If there is any.
@DavidErosenko @riceman79 @sdibari99 @Octotron @alllibertynews @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational When a president orders a war action in peace time without consent of Congress, it is an illegal action.

@shelly2161 @CostilowTracey @Octotron @alllibertynews @DavidErosenko @sdibari99 @riceman79 @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational Huh?	Obama tore apart and separated more families than the previous ten presidents combined.
@shelly2161 @CostilowTracey @Octotron @alllibertynews @DavidErosenko @sdibari99 @riceman79 @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational Those pics were from 2014.	Who was president then?
@riceman79 @Octotron @DavidErosenko @sdibari99 @alllibertynews @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational Exactly. But it is a lot harder to do. As Obama found out. Before he started four more illegal wars than the Bush admin.
@shelly2161 @Octotron @alllibertynews @DavidErosenko @sdibari99 @riceman79 @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational Yeah?	Do you know school shootings and homicides with guns is in sharp decline?	You know what is in sharp incline? The sale of more guns.	Interesting correlation, to be sure.
@shelly2161 @Octotron @alllibertynews @DavidErosenko @sdibari99 @riceman79 @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational Jails reporters? Funny you should mention that. Obama actually did jail a reporter or two in his tenure. And killed a US citizen with a drone strike and no due process.	Trump has done none of those things.
@shelly2161 @Octotron @alllibertynews @DavidErosenko @sdibari99 @riceman79 @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational How is he selling off pristine land? The BLM management was doing that with China during tye Obama tenure. Remember the Bundy Ranch and Harry Reid?
@shelly2161 @Octotron @alllibertynews @DavidErosenko @sdibari99 @riceman79 @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational Except they were policies signed by Bill Clinton and enforced in record numbers by Obama.	The ACA was a lazily written bill that got pushed without a public vote, and enforced on us as Congress exempted themselves (which is illegal).	Which prigines has he promoted? Are we at war?
@riceman79 @Octotron @DavidErosenko @sdibari99 @alllibertynews @CostilowTracey @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational I would agree, except it is a problem he inherited.	Has pulled more troops home than the previous admin.	I'm not a Trump supporter either.

@DavidErosenko @riceman79 @alllibertynews @CostilowTracey @Octotron @sdibari99 @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational Yes. But again, with Russian lawyers. Not Kremlin officials.	It is illegal to meet with foreign national agents, not foreign citizens.

I didn't vote for the guy, but the way you libs obsess over him is borderline insane.

@DavidErosenko @Octotron @riceman79 @alllibertynews @CostilowTracey @sdibari99 @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational No. He didn't. There is no proof of that. It would have been leaked already if true and you know it.
@DavidErosenko @alllibertynews @riceman79 @CostilowTracey @Octotron @sdibari99 @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational Yeah, go back up to where you explained what campaign contributions were.

@DavidErosenko @riceman79 @alllibertynews @CostilowTracey @Octotron @sdibari99 @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational Yet you claim Trump is doing the same (which he isn't) is a felony. Pick one.
@DavidErosenko @alllibertynews @riceman79 @CostilowTracey @Octotron @sdibari99 @SpeedOften @Thesilentscrea3 @WITHBERT09 @TheDemCoalition @LPNational Yes.

@lgsawyer 	This is what happens when you try to tell someone to present credible evidence to back their claims. And when you try to tell them someone is innocent until proven guilty, and when you try to tell them about the presumption of innocence and burden of proof. https://t.co/39gMyIc1gV
@lgsawyer @AaronRidindirty @alllibertynews @CentralNY @justinamash @JoeBiden @SenFeinstein It was either leaked by her, her lawyers or by @SenFeinstein team.
@lgsawyer @AaronRidindirty @alllibertynews @CentralNY @justinamash @JoeBiden @SenFeinstein No. It didn't. She conflated facts after discovery. 	Her initial story confirmed nothing. Her second story mentioned another name.	If she is so sure, why hasn't she released her therapist notes?
@lgsawyer @AaronRidindirty @alllibertynews @CentralNY @justinamash @JoeBiden @SenFeinstein And that was after he was surprised as he was to be confirmed, despite @SenFeinstein knowing about it months before, and even before her private talk with him.
@lgsawyer @AaronRidindirty @alllibertynews @CentralNY @justinamash @JoeBiden @SenFeinstein Not every innocent person. They refute the evidence. As Kavanaugh did.
@lgsawyer @AaronRidindirty @alllibertynews @CentralNY @justinamash @JoeBiden @SenFeinstein He signed an affidavit under oath that gave his testimony, as did the other three witnesses. Those are held under threat of perjury laws. If they lied, they face prison. Including Ford's lifelong friend. None corroborated her story.

@lgsawyer @AaronRidindirty @alllibertynews @CentralNY @justinamash @JoeBiden @SenFeinstein None of what you claim is enough. Nor should it alone be enough.	Our justice system has put away far too many innocent people by false accusations.	One is innocent until proven guilty. And nothing that was said is near enough to file a case.
@lgsawyer @AaronRidindirty @alllibertynews @CentralNY @justinamash @JoeBiden @SenFeinstein You need more than that to prove guilt. You need more than a calendar to initiate an investigation. Even eye witness testimony alone is hardly enough to take someone to court because of how faulty the mind is, esp after a trauma.	The mind remembers time and place and little else.
It has been used interchangeably for drinking games, as well. Even when I was in college.	And FFFF has also been used as written fart jokes.	What you have is mere circumstantial evidence, at best.	No one else came out with credible accusations against the man. Not even Ford. https://t.co/MImf6yR2iq

@lgsawyer @CentralNY @justinamash @JoeBiden @SenFeinstein We are having a discourse here and if you resort to childish tactics, as such, then you aren't interested in a discussion.	Discredit my points. That is how it works.
@AaronRidindirty @alllibertynews @lgsawyer @CentralNY @justinamash @JoeBiden @SenFeinstein I listened to everything leading up to the hearing and watched the hearing. She wrote her story to the Post first, while mailing a letter to Feinstein.	Her story changed mulitple times and her witnesses did not corroborate her story, which harms its "credibility."
@lgsawyer @CentralNY @justinamash @JoeBiden @SenFeinstein How is it credible?	Her story changed 3 times.	She couldn't remember key details, such as time and place.	Her "witnesses" included a friend that denied it all, so uncorroborated.	She leaked her story to the press first, then wanted anonymity.
@lgsawyer @CentralNY @justinamash @JoeBiden @SenFeinstein And if you're against Kav for SCOTUS, at least make it about his idea that the Patriot Act, which Dems made even more powerful and overreaching, is somehow NOT a violation of the 4th Amendment...

@RadicalGoats @Quest15011954 @TheEconomist Housing and living costs are rising in metropolises because higher value jobs are created, which allow for the people in those fields to move in, which increases the value of these neighborhoods, which encourages gentrification that helps clean up areas of debris and crime
@RadicalGoats @Quest15011954 @TheEconomist Not blaming them as a whole, but many that are still poor are poor because of poor financial decisions. I'm sorry if think the truth is too mean to tell that to people.
@RadicalGoats @Quest15011954 @TheEconomist Exactly. Because more people have more money. Even the lower brackets, who do share larger portions of their income.
@RadicalGoats @Quest15011954 @TheEconomist Much, much different scenario.
@RadicalGoats @Quest15011954 @TheEconomist It puts them iin a unique spot for sure. It is far easier for them to turn their life around than anywhere else in the world.	And numerous charity programs offer those services.
@RadicalGoats @Quest15011954 @TheEconomist People need to understand the term "live within their means," and constantly adjust. It isn't easy, but worthwhile goals shouldn't be.
@RadicalGoats @Quest15011954 @TheEconomist We live in a consumer-base society now. It isn't about production anymore. Money has shifted from that means toward tech and stem fields, of which there is plenty room for hires, and growth
@RadicalGoats @Quest15011954 @TheEconomist Seriously?	Charity happens precisely because more people have more money money.	This does not happen as largely (not even close) in other forms of government or economy.
@RadicalGoats @Quest15011954 @TheEconomist Excuse after excuse is laid out for people to take. Especially in schools. But it isn't true. Change is hard, but if people want it bad enough, it comes.
