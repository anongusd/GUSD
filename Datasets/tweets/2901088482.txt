@PatriciaJewel @HouseDemocrats @NancyPelosi They come off as swing really far to the left, but the fact that there are only a small portion of democratic socialists/hard progressives means it‚Äôs just the far left that has a loud voice and that‚Äôs tend to be how people across the spectrum perceive the Democrats to be.
@PathComic @apgroner @sloworbit @HouseDemocrats @SassyNeveragain @NancyPelosi But she‚Äôs arguably the most formidable politician among House Democrats, being the speaker of the House is not about ideology it‚Äôs about politically astute you are and how effective can you galvanize Democratuc caucuses and negotiate with Republicans.
Perhaps it‚Äôs too late to say this, but I think it‚Äôs unfair for many to attack Kavanaugh to such a personal degree. The senate went through an investigation, you can doubt his merit but constant attacks on him as a person and using allegations as truth will only bring backlash.
