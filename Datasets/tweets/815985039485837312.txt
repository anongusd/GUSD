Happy to welcome the most diverse Congress in #USA history! The #American people are counting on us. Let's get to work!
A #TrumpShutdown of the southern border would crush California &amp; Texas’s economies. Hundreds of billions in business lost. Texas alone could lose a million jobs. 		@realDonaldTrump is taking people’s lives hostage.
$615 billion &amp; over a million jobs. That’s what our President is holding hostage by threatening to close the border. He would fire a million Americans over a political promise that won’t work. 		Just as with his business @realDonaldTrump doesn’t care who loses as long as he wins.

After two years @realDonaldTrump still doesn’t understand how important judicial independence is to our legal system. I applaud Justice Roberts for standing in defense of the rule of law.
@realDonaldTrump Firefighters have died. First responders have died. Californians have died. Your response to their sacrifices shows that you don’t understand California’s challenges.
Devastated by the news coming out of Thousands Oaks. My thoughts and prayers are with the families, especially Sheriff’s Deputy Ron Helus’ family, whose bravery &amp; sacrifice saved countless lives.
Mr. Mueller and the investigation into foreign interference of the 2016 election must not be impeded. It is imperative that whomever @realDonaldTrump selects to replace Jeff Sessions, vows to continue and protect the ongoing investigation.

@realDonaldTrump has purposed a $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan. We need more details, but a good #first step. #America needs this. Let’s get to #work. #SOTU
If @realDonaldTrump is serious about investing $1.5 trillion into #USA #infrastructure, creating countless good paying #jobs that get #Americans back to work… Count Me In. #SOTU
I came to #congress to #work across the aisle. I hope my colleagues are #serious about investing $1 trillion in our crumbling roads &amp; bridges. We in #OC know how to #build. #SOTU
Funding our #military is imperative, but so is taking care of our #veterans. #SOTU
Every service men and women deserves proper #medical care and #benefits once they return #home. Invest in #veterans. #SOTU
@realDonaldTrump praises our #military but cuts programs #veterans depend on. Both are #important. #SOTU
The #AmericanDream depends on a #strong foundation — Good #jobs. Affordable #education. Robust #infrastructure. #SOTU
The road to the #Middleclass is paved on a #strong foundation — Good #jobs. Affordable #education. Robust #infrastructure. Achieving the #AmericanDream depends on it. #SOTU
Talk to anyone in my district. We need #jobs. We need #education. We need #infrastructure. Everything else depends on this strong #foundation. #SOTU
#Unemployment is down and the stock market is up, but folks still aren’t feeling the economic boom in their #pockets. We need #better #paying #jobs if more #Americans are going to reach the #MiddleClass. #SOTU

To #DREAMers, don’t give up. Don’t give up #hope. Lot’s of rounds left in this fight.
Every day our #Government is shutdown over $1 billion is lost. Our economy needs congress to work together and pass a budget.  #EndTheShutdown.
Today, 850,000+ government employees are staying home. That’s money out of their pocket and out of our #economy. #EndTheShutdown
I am #fighting for the rights of my #constituents, because they deserve #better than this. #EndTheShutdown
Still here waiting for @realDonaldTrump to come up with a #BetterDeal that includes #DREAMers, community health centers, and our #military.
Americans deserve the best from their representatives. I won’t stop #fighting until my constituent voices are heard during this shutdown. #EndTheShutdown
If the majority truly cared about #fiscal responsibility, they would work with @HouseDemocrats on a long-term #bipartisan solutions.
In September I voted for a continuing resolution, along with all @HouseDemocrats &amp; many #GOP. We have had four CRs. A 5th is not a long-term solution! We need a permanent #budget that helps all #Americans!
I’m still in the Capitol fighting for a reasonable #bipartisan solution that will reopen the #government and help our military, invest in community health centers, protect our borders, and save #DREAMers.

6 weeks &amp; still no Spanish https://t.co/NvkkatQx9G. If @Potus won’t do it on his own, I have legislation to motivate him.
@SpeakerRyan #SaveACA it works and millions of Americans depend on it for their care.
Sec. Kelly said on #CNN he is considering separating undocumented kids from their families. #Wrong #DHS #ICE
I joined @HispanicCaucus to request a meeting w/ #CBP. https://t.co/8jcBgwDCxR
#DREAMers are always #welcome here https://t.co/qAW3BrL22B
How can we have clean air &amp; water when you proposed drastic cuts to the EPA.
@potus the government doesn’t assign people health insurance… people do get to choose their plan.
#ACA saves lives. 293,000 in my district have access to healthcare because of it.
Our infrastructure is crumbling. Thousands of jobs. Great potential. …but where does @potus find $1 Trillion dollars?
“Give me your tired, your poor, you huddled masses“ @potus where do they fall in your new immigration plan?
We need good paying middle class jobs, but they won’t be the jobs of the past. We need jobs for our future.
Our nation was founded by religious refugees to be open and inclusive. Refugees are always welcome here.
@potus still wants to spend billions on a wall we don’t need, won’t keep us safe, and demeans our neighbors. #NoBanNoWall
@potus You can’t claim to drain the swamp with a cabinet of billionaires
RT @HispanicCaucus: .@realDonaldTrump, we've been ready. #CIR #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/hs0zo5EoyX
@POTUS is laying the ground work for mass deportation. Breaking up families. Ruining Lives. #wrong https://t.co/VWpufArY8e
I wont stand for it @kdeleon wont stand for it @JerryBrownGov wont stand for it If @POTUS comes @ CA we’ll stop him https://t.co/2IDHnpQPBs
Nobody here is armed. We aren’t criminals. We aren’t gang members. The only thing we want is transparency https://t.co/lnAx4VFBhu
The only thing we want today is #transparency. We need information. https://t.co/9APdYGmh1w
#ICE accepted our invitation  cancelled it &amp; now won’t let us in. Our constituents need answers @normajtorres @RepGutierrez @RepBarragan https://t.co/IhS4FQnD3b
#ICE is stonewalling me &amp; my peers. Their silence on raids &amp; @POTUS campaign rhetoric make it harder to tell constituents not to be scared.
Immigrants are the the backbone of America #ToImmigrantsWithLove https://t.co/l6bi3MHqPc
After #ICE cancelled today’s meeting, I sent them a second letter urge them to answer my questions on #SoCal #immigrant raids https://t.co/RqZysiFnHp
Still waiting for an answer: ”How far in advance were these enforcement activities planned?" https://t.co/IAw5VIMTCn
Today I sent this letter to #ICE seeking answers to the raids in #LA #SoCal #knowyourrights https://t.co/eDsOm6503G
Deeply concerned by #LA ICE Raids. We are investigating but more questions than answers. Fighting 4 Due Process. #knowyourrights https://t.co/rgyzPsezZr
@SenHarris Thank you for introducing your bill. It goes hand in hand with H.R. 858 the DIRE Legal Aid Act. Due Process will be protected!
Due Process prevailed. The President's ban is #unconstitutional. Period. America will not turn her back on the world. #MuslimBan
Once again we have another Executive Order demonizing immigrants. Taxpaying families shouldn’t be treated like violent criminals.
Law abiding citizen are scared to death over #immigration #noban
I’ll be speaking w/ Sec Kelly on #immigration while protecting due process. https://t.co/NeRUZrO9Pi https://t.co/rIc6ThHJOf

We are a nation of immigrants. We must recognized the hard work of those that make this Nation great, with and without documents.
The key to the American Dream is a solid public education.
We need to preserve the ladder to the middle class - good paying jobs. My constituents need good paying jobs.
