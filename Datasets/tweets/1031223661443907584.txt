We have to remind ourselves continually of these major crimes while dealing with the scandal du jour. We can walk and chew gum at the same time.
If we ignore his rhetoric, character, and policies, here's why Trump is a threat to our democracy:	-He worked with a foreign adversary to influence our elections	-He is actively obstructing the investigation thereof	-He is continually receiving emoluments through his businesses
In all seriousness though, this administration uses scandal to cover up for scandal. Never get distracted from Trump's threat to our democracy.

@LizbethSherburn @LindaDark6 @ACLU I prefer reading too, but I had heard the podcast on my commute yesterday. The link also has a transcript of it on the same page.
@LizbethSherburn @LindaDark6 @ACLU They also mentioned they considered whether they would make the same recommendation if they thought Kavanaugh's appointment would be favorable to them. We all should ask ourselves that question.
@LizbethSherburn @LindaDark6 @ACLU I thought it was interesting that their threshold was somewhere between believing Ford and proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and that concern for the court was the deciding factor.
@LizbethSherburn @LindaDark6 @ACLU The podcast was very interesting. In particular I liked hearing about their calculus in choosing to oppose a nominee that might one day rule on their cases, as well as their history of judicial recommendations. I listened again to check my comments, and it was worth it.
@LindaDark6 @LizbethSherburn @ACLU While I commend your listening to other opinions, your summary is incomplete. They explicitly state that Ford's accusations were insufficient on their own to oppose Kavanaugh, but his explosive temperament and partisanship in the hearing caused concern for the court's integrity.
Yesterday I got RT'd by @turnip2020 and got a small taste of how hectic vegetable fame came be. I think I prefer to romaine underground.
