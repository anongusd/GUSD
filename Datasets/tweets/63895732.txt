@FluorescentGrey I agree. "Treason" language is also extremely unhelpful.
@FluorescentGrey That's true. The media has a tendency to get ahead of itself and cast wider conspiracies/nets than those that are proven. But I don't think the pushback against concern over election interference has been entirely healthy.
@FluorescentGrey But that doesn't mean these laws are irrelevant or without purpose.
@FluorescentGrey Probably because A.) They don't have to to address problematic activities. And B.) It's damn near impossible to quantify.
@FluorescentGrey As for it being "misleading' to talk about election interference without discussing impact, I see your point. But election laws rarely if ever address the electoral impact of election law violations.
@FluorescentGrey It appears that there are at least some criminal aspects to what occurred and the indictments don't hinge on effectiveness in flipping/suppressing votes.
@FluorescentGrey That should be a separate issue and one which, in all likelihood, we'll never get an answer. But uncertainty about whether or not election interference turned the election shouldn't be used to cast uncertainty on evidence of interference.

1. You can oppose a new Cold War AND oppose Russian interference in US elections.		2. You can oppose US election interference in countries around the world AND oppose Russian interference in US elections.		Both 1 and 2 require the ability to chew gum AND walk. IT'S NOT THAT HARD.

@mattyglesias But why assume he cut the check because of dom. issues?		Yes, House elections are decided on domestic issues.		But Adelson could still expect his payback on the foreign policy front via various congressional actions or as another point of leverage over WH.
@mattyglesias Whether Israel is or isn't an issue in the House elections (which it never is and probably never will be) it seems pretty obvious Adelson is 1.) most interested in Israel 2.) most active and highest spending on Israel and 3.) getting the most traction with Israel/Iran policy.
@mattyglesias Didn't say they were. But Adelson probably sees his support of the GOP as a long-term investment in what he cares about. And the reality is that the GOP is now deeply indebted to a megadonor with a self-acknowledged set of interests and the GOP seems happy to indulge him.
@chrislhayes and @mattyglesias prefer to speculate about Trump and GOP megadonor Sheldon Adelson's desire to lower the estate tax rather than wrestle with Adelson's self-described foreign policy motivations. Why? https://t.co/kacYwBzOT9
@ThinkProgress hasn't put the name of Trump's and the GOP's biggest donor in a headline for over two years. Why?   https://t.co/kacYwBzOT9
There's ample evidence of Trump and GOP megadonor Sheldon Adelson's influence over the the WH's foreign policy decision making. 		So why can't mainstream and progressive news outlets discuss Adelson's role? https://t.co/kacYwBzOT9
