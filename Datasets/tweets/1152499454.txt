@MarkSZaidEsq Pelosi controls the chamber in which the address is traditionally given. Trump can’t just show up there uninvited and take the floor. I think he could probably give the address whenever he wants from the Oval Office though.
@SenSanders @gaywonk Why didn’t you vote to keep sanctions on Russian businesses? Why did you previously oppose sanctions against Russian businesses and individuals?

@glasshalfMT14 @CheriJacobus @j_zimms The difference between Warren and Biden is inconsequential relative to the difference between them both and Trump.

@realDonaldTrump How about you do your job and re-open the government?
@CheriJacobus Unsurprisingly, I never claimed supporting Haley made anyone sexist. Saying your Dad can’t be sexist because he, an avowed Republican, would support Haley over a Democrat just isn’t a compelling argument. It also doesn’t address the question of why Biden but not Warren vs Trump.
@CheriJacobus @glasshalfMT14 @j_zimms I’m not advocating for any of these candidates except to say pretty much anyone would be better than Trump. It sounds like your Dad agrees as to Biden but not Warren. What’s the difference?		The space between Biden and Warren is nothing compared to the space between them &amp; Trump.
@CheriJacobus @j_zimms I’ll support whoever the Dem nominee is: Biden, Warren, or whoever. You haven’t offered any reason aside from sexism to explain why your Dad would pick Biden over Trump but Trump over Warren.	 	“But he’d support Haley if Trump wasn’t running” doesn’t answer that question.
@CheriJacobus Nope. But if she said she supported Biden AND that she’d rather have Trump than Warren, as you said your Dad would, it’d sure raise some questions.
@glasshalfMT14 @CheriJacobus @j_zimms I never said that. There are tons of differences between them! 		The question is: what difference between Biden and Warren would explain why a Republican so disgusted with Trump that he’d vote for Biden in protest would still prefer Trump over Warren?
@CheriJacobus @j_zimms Nikki Haley is a red herring-the question you posed was who your Dad would vote for if Trump was running. How can anyone who’d think Biden is better than Trump also think Trump is better than Warren? What justification is there for that aside from sexism?
@CheriJacobus @j_zimms You said your Dad would vote Biden over Trump but would let Trump remain in office rather than vote for Warren. There is no explanation for that position other than sexism.

@davidjoachim No, it is not how a president behaves. Unfortunately, it is exactly how Trump behaves. He’s done it repeatedly-he’ll say something outrageous then get called out on it then walk it back. There’s no reason to think he’d walk it back if he didn’t get called out on it.
@davidjoachim I disagree. I think what he said yesterday was a trial balloon. If there had been no push back, he would have doubled down on suggesting troops should use deadly force. Instead he faced heavy resistance so he pulled back.

@sadydoyle NYers are tactical. Sour patch kids are the perfect candy to give away for Halloween-good enough that nobody thinks you’re cheap, gross enough that nobody complains about only getting one mini bag. Just one Almond Joy? Ya stingy. Two SPK bags? Oh no, I don’t want to he greedy.
@caias @elonjames Yes. That is exactly what is happening.  Not tipping does not fix it: it just shifts the cost from the diner to the server. The employer still gets exactly as much money.		Advocate for a living wage for servers and vote accordingly. Until the system is changed, tip.
@jbendery Just wait until you get to be a deponent in his lawsuit. That part’s less fun. Glad you helped him though!
@elonjames I completely agree with that.
@elonjames We should totally draw attention to the broken system. Advocate and work for change. I don’t see that not tipping or under tipping accomplishes either of those things. 		I meant no criticism of you at all, just a response to your question about what if someone needs comfort food.
@elonjames Not tipping or tipping poorly is essentially requiring the server to subsidize your meal with their labor to the extent that meal would cost more if the restaurant paid livable wages. That’s not fair or right, no matter how badly you need comfort food.
@elonjames It’s a shit system. Absent changing it, the question boils down to who should bear the cost of it: the server who is trying to make a living or the person who is choosing to eat out? As between those two, the person eating out should bear the cost.

@shannonminter5 @mattyglesias @zacharyherz Absolutely.
@shannonminter5 @mattyglesias @zacharyherz Agreed that it is not mere teenage misconduct but there is a good case for forgiving truly repentant adults even for violent crimes they committed as teenagers.

@latimes Both extremely effective for their constituents. What wonderful role models for young people!
@DC1776 By all means, investigate Democrats. Republicans in Congress have been doing little else for years. If there’s evidence of a crime, file charges. 		But even 1,000 Democrats being found guilty of some crime wouldn’t make Manafort, Papadopolous, Gates, Flynn, etc. any less guilty.
@DC1776 If I got a ticket for speeding, saying “hey that other guy was going fast too but didn’t get a ticket!” might be true but it wouldn’t help.		Similarly, when numerous Republicans are shown to have committed crimes, saying “you should investigate Dems too” isn’t a legit defense.
@DC1776 All potential crimes should be investigated and prosecuted. Where the person in question holds high office, we should be considering not only potential criminal liability but also whether they are abusing the trust of their office. 		All Americans should be able to agree to this.
@Marie10778357 @Cernovich Manafort’s trial re: Russia hasn’t started yet.		The Constitution gives him Trump the authority to direct the DOJ generally but doing so to circumvent the law is abuse of office and criminal obstruction. Trump has admitted his motives on tv and Twitter.
@valtrex73 @Cernovich Hiring a “dirty” campaign manager either means Trump is incompetent or he didn’t mind that Manafort was dirty. Either option reflects poorly on Trump. 		The facts about Trump are negative because he repeatedly makes bad choices. It isn’t the media’s fault the facts are negative.
@DC1776 @Cernovich If you got in trouble at school, saying “you can’t punish me until you’ve investigated whether anyone else has been bad!” would have earned a laugh. That idea is just as ridiculous here.	Crimes committed by others (if any) are irrelevant to whether reporting on Trump is accurate.
@babysgramma @Cernovich Reports that the President’s campaign manager has been found guilty and many others in his inner circle have pleaded guilty or been indicted are accurate. Those facts make Trump look bad. That is not the media’s fault, it is Trump’s fault for surrounding himself with criminals.
@SteeveLouis7 @Cernovich Because “but so-and-so was bad too!” didn’t work as an excuse when you were a kid and it doesn’t work now. Crimes committed by others (if any) should of course be investigated but the conduct of others does not excuse Trump.
@valtrex73 @Cernovich Among other things, he was convicted of committing bank fraud through a series of transactions ending in October of 2016.		The whataboutism is tiring. 	“But so-and-so was bad too!” didn’t work as an excuse in grade school and it doesn’t work now.

@valtrex73 @Cernovich Manafort was involved in the campaign after being nominally fired. His connections to criminality weren’t secret-they’re why McCain refused to hire him at all. Part of the fraud Manafort was convicted for occurred in 2016. Manafort’s next trial relates directly to Russia.
@dukesb12 @Cernovich You can argue that Trump’s campaign manager being convicted on 8 felony counts means nothing for Trump (though I disagree) but you can’t seriously argue that the press shouldn’t report on it.

@Red3Biggs @budbundystyles Do you think pursuing an all-out obstruct everything at all costs agenda would adversely impact the ability of Dems to pick up desperately needed GOP seats in the midterms?
@Red3Biggs @budbundystyles They didn’t think it worth expending political capital to slow down confirmations that would eventually be made without them. I disagree with that choice but it doesn’t change the fact they lack the power to stop Kavanaugh procedurally.
@Red3Biggs @budbundystyles I can certainly agree with that.
@Red3Biggs @budbundystyles They’re already delaying things and will continue to do so. And of course McConnell will put Kavanaugh first on the docket-requiring him to do that accomplishes nothing. That won’t prevent Kavanaugh’s confirmation. Questioning him and eliciting damaging answers might.
@Red3Biggs @budbundystyles You didn’t answer the question. What more would you have them do here? I agree it is frustrating but if you only buy half the sandbags you need, it isn’t the fault of the sandbags that they don’t stop the floodwaters. Vote more Dems into office.
@Red3Biggs @budbundystyles They are, through careful questioning, pushing Kavanaugh toward being untruthful, creating a record that could later be used to impeach him from the court. That’s not dramatic but probably the smartest thing they can do.
@Red3Biggs @budbundystyles They cannot stop the Senate functionally. Grassley can ignore their motions to adjourn as he’s done. If they all walk out, Grassley can ask for a motion to dispense with quorum and no Dem will be there to object so the motion will pass. Seriously, what do you think they could do?

@mackyntoich @JamesSACorey Lots of baseless lawsuits are filed. They don’t result in jury verdicts sustained in appeal. So to say someone who’s been discriminated against could file a baseless lawsuit is true but also the equivalent of saying they could scream into the void for all the good it’d do them.
@JamesSACorey You said bakers should be allowed to discriminate and aggrieved customers can sue. But if bakers are allowed to discriminate under the law, then there’s no legal basis for the customers to sue them. The idea you can successfully sue for anything if you have damages is incorrect.
@JamesSACorey I love your writing. I don’t mean to be patronizing but suggesting a civil suit as recourse when that suit will necessarily be dismissed is ... not really much recourse. Which is why we need anti-discrimination laws in the first place. Peace.

@JerryFalwellJr @jeffsessions @LibertyU @realDonaldTrump The Attorney General’s loyalty should be to the Constitution and rule of law. Your expectation that Sessions be loyal to Trump above all else is both gross and inconsistent with the principles on which this country was founded.
Nope. Trump wants to be able to say he was willing to talk to Mueller but his lawyers wouldn’t let him. “I’m just following my lawyer’s advice” is a better look than the reality of his abject cowardice and consciousness of guilt. https://t.co/3zUmHCQqgV

@MattWalshBlog Has it occurred to you that priests are far more likely to have unsupervised contact with young boys than young girls? Or did you ignore that fact because it didn’t support your homophobic thesis?
@notshanebauer @dcexaminer Maybe you think Trump’s policies will eventually bear fruit and if we wait things will improve. That’s fine. You can think that. But it is categorically false to say that we are better off because of his policies now.
@notshanebauer @dcexaminer Unemployment has been trending down for 7 years. Fewer jobs were added in Trump’s first 18 months than Obama’s last 18 months. And again, wages are lower now than they were a year ago. Gas and food prices are up. The numbers don’t lie- working class people are worse off now.
@DrJenGunter Right? Animals should 100% be treated humanely but this chicken stress chemical thing is asinine. Thanks for calling it out.
@notshanebauer @dcexaminer Literally every respectable economist agrees that Trump’s policies have been at best ineffective and at worst disastrous. They’re so bad he feels the need to bail out farmers that were fine a year ago. But you keep believing that we’re winning because that’s what Fox tells you.
@notshanebauer @dcexaminer That would have been the 5th best quarter of Obama’s presidency and in this case even Republican economists agree it is due to companies ramping up manufacturing before the tariffs take effect, not true sustainable growth. Meanwhile wages are lower than they were a year ago.
@notshanebauer @dcexaminer Name one sector of the economy that is better off now than it was before Trump started his asinine trade wars. I’ll wait.
@notshanebauer @dcexaminer “in the process of being dropped”		I’m “in the process” of sending you bunch of money in the mail. Seriously, how gullible are you?
@notshanebauer @dcexaminer Was a deal reached? No. They merely agreed to talk. Which of course we were doing before that. 		Calling that a win would be like saying someone who handed you the address to a car dealership had negotiated you a great price on a new car. The negotiations haven’t even begun.
@dcexaminer I mean, to the extent “traditional” masculinity is based on subjugating women, yeah. It’s definitely time for that to go.

@dcexaminer Trump hired these people. How pathetic is it that he commands so little loyalty from them, he has to spy on them to see whether they’re leaking?
@CynthiaNixon @OurRevolution @BernieSanders You will one day look back on this as the moment your campaign ended.

@BobbyShaftoe11 @SharylAttkisson @BookTV Of course there are conspiracy theorists on the left. My point was that they’re not being interviewed on tv because we all agree there’s no need to give them attention. Why do you have a lower standard when the conspiracy theorist is on the right?

@AZMIAakaMIA To be honest, I doubt many of us could do a week at your job. I don’t expect him to be a hero but his lack of any shred of compassion is ... disturbing, to say the least.
@AZMIAakaMIA I’d like him to spend a day in family court to see how much effort goes in to keeping kids out of the foster care system as much as possible. Foster placement can meet an important need but it is always ALWAYS a last resort. It makes NO sense to use it when parents are available.

@auttrianna @eveewing Here, you tell the 911 operator what the problem is and they decide who to dispatch. To get the FD out, I’d have to lie and say there was a fire. I suspect they’d call in the police when they arrived and realized what I’d done.
@eveewing Thank you! We have a neighbor who occasionally suffers from psychotic episodes but we don’t feel like we can call to get her help even when she’s endangering herself because there’s too high a risk the police will kill her. I wish we had an option to call for unarmed assistance.

@waveringliberal You responded to me with a straw man argument and an ad hominem attack. Neither are worth my time. We will all see how this plays out.
@brianbeutler @MattGertz Fortunately it won’t be Congress that determines whether he can avoid a subpoena.
@waveringliberal @dcexaminer As a lawyer, I can unequivocally tell you that is NOT what lawyers are for. I will be shocked if Cohen is not disbarred over this. 		In any event, having someone on retainer to lend your campaign money doesn’t make it any less a loan when they lend your campaign money.
@waveringliberal @dcexaminer Candidates disclose money owed to businesses to the FEC. If a candidate could avoid reporting contributions by calling them loans and promising to repay them later, campaign finance laws would be pointless.
@dcexaminer Yet he’s supposedly been repaying Cohen for months? Doesn’t add up.
@waveringliberal @dcexaminer The payment to Daniels was to benefit the campaign. Giuliani confirmed that on Fox this am. Trump repaid the payment in installments later. Hence the payment was a loan to the campaign that Trump repaid. If Trump has committed a crime, he should be held accountable. He won’t be.
@waveringliberal @dcexaminer The retainer payment doesn’t change anything. Trump personally can spend whatever he wants on his election but his campaign effectively took a loan from Cohen then failed to disclose the value of that loan-which is a campaign finance law violation. We’ll see what happens.
@waveringliberal @dcexaminer Speaking for myself, I don’t care about the sex. I care that he tried to silence her before the campaign, lied about it, and violated campaign finance laws. He has deceived the American people as to his health, his finances, and his personal life. That’s a problem.
@dcexaminer Nobody believes he paid $130K to someone making false accusations.
@BradMossEsq Who else would misuse roll?
