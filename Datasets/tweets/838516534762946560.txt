Almost half of all accredited MD-granting institutions in the United States have 0 enrolled AI/AN medical students. This is not necessarily a problem. #NativeStudents should apply to medical schools that understand how to both recruit and retain Native medical students.

@mattMD @SecAzar Underfunding of the Indian Health Service has been a problem since 1955. The dysfunction of the IHS did not stem from acute costs that would certainly come from the implementation of #MedicareForAll. In my eyes, you cannot use the IHS as an example here.
@mattMD @SecAzar How is the IHS supposed to properly operate if it is appropriated a fraction of what it requires to deliver healthcare to millions of Americans?
@misterchambo @SeemaCMS How would you fix the VA and IHS then? Individuals seeking care from either agency are Americans who deserve optimal, standard care. Care provided by the VA is a commitment to our Veterans; care provided by the IHS is a treaty-mandated obligation with 573 Indian tribes.

Figures from the @CDCgov indicate the increase in that period was higher for Native Americans than ANY other group, jumping to roughly 22 deaths for every 100,000 people in metropolitan areas and nearly 20 for every 100,000 people in non-metropolitan areas.

Overhauling the Indian Health Service should NOT be contingent upon Indian tribes condoning this affront to federal treaty and trust obligations. This is a slippery slope waiting to happen.
The United States has a duty to implement programs like the Medicaid program in a way that does not inadvertently raise barriers to participation by AI/ANs.
This will deprive IHS and tribal facilities of a critically important source of funding. Medicaid represented ~$810,000,000 or 13% of @IHSgov Program Funding in FY2016.
Unlike other Medicaid enrollees, AI/ANs have a right to access IHS services. AI/ANs would not need to meet mandatory work requirements to obtain coverage at IHS and may instead simply elect not to enroll in Medicaid.
.@NaomiSRiley suggests that President Trump could make Medicaid work requirements more "palatable" by offering something in return: a major overhaul of the dysfunctional Indian Health Service. Here's why that won't work: https://t.co/0eERg1GdXk

When @NIHB1 convened the inaugural cohort of their youth fellowship in March 2017, we as #NativeYouth decided to focus our advocacy around behavioral health and food sovereignty. Our resolutions were adopted into ACTUAL legislation. We are #GenerationIndigenous! @MichelleLynea
#NativeYouth are the driving force behind legislation that aims to create a "Special Behavioral Health Program for Indians", which models the structure of the Special Diabetes Program for Indians. #S2545 #HR3704
The @NIHB1 Tribal Youth Health Policy Fellows are pleased to see that @TinaSmithMN @SenatorTomUdall @SenatorTester @SenCortezMasto @SenWarren @SenatorHeitkamp introduced S.2545 into the Senate! This bill represents 12 months of sustained advocacy by #NativeYouth and @NIHB1.
@AZINMED If anyone is interested in applying and has Qs, please send them my way!
That Gen-I spirit was fostered by a number of mentors! Special s/o to @MichelleLynea for her work with the @NIHB1 Health Policy Fellows. She inspired me to share my experiences with #NativeYouth, and is putting #FirstKids1st! https://t.co/GMJlMRGXQ9

The @IHSgov ‚ÄúDiabetes and Dementia‚Äù webinar is scheduled for January 23rd at 3PM EST / 11AM AKST. More information can be found here: https://t.co/i7HKjVum7P
Furthermore, diabetes and prediabetic states have consistently been shown to be risk factors for cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Dr. Blythe Winchester, an IHS Chief Clinical Consultant, will be hosting an online webinar about this topic.
The @IHSgov Ntl. Data Warehouse has reported that: (1) obsty+diabetes rates in AI/AN youth have not inc. in more than 10 yrs &amp; (2) diabetes rates in AI/AN adults have not inc. since '11. #SDPI has changed the course of diabetes, so why has HR2545 idled in #SubHealth for 246 days?
ESRD requires expensive treatments and is the single largest driver of Medicare costs. The Medicare cost per year for hemodialysis (a common ESRD treatment) exceeded $84,000/patient in 2013. #SDPI funding allows programs to be #proactive when it comes to diabetes interventions.
The #SDPI has led to millions of dollars in healthcare cost savings by decreasing the prevalence of costly preventable diabetes complications such as end-stage renal disease (ESRD) for AI/ANs. @AmDiabetesAssn @NIDDK @IHSgov
SDPI 2014 Key Clinical Outcomes: mean blood sugar level decreased from 9.0% to 8.1% (T: &lt;8%), mean LDL cholesterol declined from 118 mg/dL to 92 mg/dL (T: &lt;100 mg/dL, mean blood pressure was 131/76 (T: &lt;140/&lt;90 mmHg), and incidence of ESRD has decreased by more than 40%. @IHSgov
There were 301 #SDPI (252 Tribal, 20 IHS, 29 Urban) community-directed grant programs in FY16.
The #SDPI serves 780,000 people each year. $150M/year, 301 grantees, 35 States. https://t.co/97WI600VxQ
Since the first #SDPI authorization, there has been:	a 40% inc. in diabetes clinics, 	a 42% inc. in access to registered nutritionists, and	a 61% increase in availability of culturally-tailored ed. programs.	#ThisIsTribalPublicHealth @nihb1 @newtgingrich @ErskineBowles @JDRF
SDPI is the most strategic+effective federal initiative to combat #diabetes; providing funds to IHS, Tribal, and Urban Health Programs in all 12 @IHSgov Areas to begin or enhance diabetes treatment+prevention programs.

@RepMullin @HHSGov @HouseCommerce @michaelcburgess @GOPHELP @SenAlexander The great state of Oklahoma received around $23.5M of the $150M given to the Special Diabetes Program for Indians (over 25 grantees) in FY2016. The time to act on long-term reauthorization of #SDPI is now.
@RepMullin @HHSGov It is up to @HouseCommerce @michaelcburgess #SubHealth and @GOPHELP @SenAlexander to bring these bills out of committee, so that the over 300 SDPI grantees can work toward creating a diabetes-free generation; one individual at a time.
@RepMullin @HHSGov Long-term reauthorization is the solution, and already exists with #HR2545 and #S747. Two-year funding cycles are not conducive to the operation of a national community-directed grant program.
