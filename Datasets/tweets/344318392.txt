@FoxNews @foxnewspolitics Gov.Christie is in an entirely different league than Sen. Paul. Can't see them sitting down for a beer!
@adndotcom This is not news. Leave George Zimmerman alone. If I got stopped for speeding would it be news?
@CBSNews @CBSEveningNews @TerrellCBS A-Rod deserves a lifetime ban. No leniency is warranted!
@MarthaSugalski @CrossFitLM You rock, Martha! You don't look like you just had triplets. What a wonderful role model for moms.
@WESH KUDOS to the entire WESH staff, especially Stephanie Kolp, camera &amp; helicopter crews in the field, &amp;  in the studio; great job!
@WESH This is not news.  Leave George Zimmerman alone.  Stories like this jeopardize his safety. Would my traffic stop be news worthy?
@clickorlando This is not news. Leave George Zimmerman alone. You jeopardize his safety.
@ABC This is not news. Leave George Zimmerman alone.  His safety depends on it!
@USATODAY @USATOpinion The FDA should regulate all supplements. The American public is at risk of being poisoned as there are no regulations
@cnnbrk We have a significant explosion at a large propane plant in Florida, why isn't CNN covering it? Even BBC is reporting it?
@eonline Please tell me why this tweet is newsworthy?  It's not even good gossip!
@TMZ JB behaves like an immature child! Spitting in public; peeing in a bucket in a kitchen. Society: Quit sanctioning this behavior!
@nprscottsimon I'm glad my kids have never gotten too big to hug, kiss or hold hands. My oldest son died at 42; I have great memories now!
@HuffingtonPost Disgusting! I might expect this behavior from the government or entertainment industry but corporate America?  Really!
@SenJohnMcCain @NRSC Thank you for honoring Colonel Bud Day. May we never forget the heroes who have served our country.
@MarthaSugalski So tiny, so beautiful.  Sleeping and growing!
@MarthaSugalski Absolutely lovely!  It looks like Heaton will be ready to ride over to Kissimmee for the next Kowtown celebration.
@LukeRussert @joshgreenman @NYDNGregSmith Someone needs to convince this delusional man to withdraw from the NYC mayors race immediately!
@MarthaSugalski Thanks for sharing this adorable photo Martha.
@MarthaSugalski I am in awe how you are out running already! I am constantly amazed with all your energy. You are a true inspiration to all!
@NolteNC I disagree. Many factors contribute to failed schools and problems in black America. I suggest the "right" is more responsible!
@nytimes @nytopinion I disagree. I find this conclusion an insult to all smokers addicted to nicotine who have tried hard to quit and failed
@MyFoxOrlando @FOX35John Proof of voter registration should be adequate. When I registered to vote I provided ID and proof of residence.
@msnbc @ChrisCQuinn Weiner's contribution to campaign in NYC is distraction from important issues facing the city. Step down Weiner!
@msnbc I hope the justice dept. and/or courts step in. We cannot go backward in time! Citizens must never be disenfranchised from voting!
@WESH I come from a state where we don't elect sheriffs.  I've never seen problems in police departments like I have seen here in Florida!
@AC360 the George Zimmerman trial has dominated the press far too long.  It has now become a major media event.  The trial is over!
@marcorubio it is behavior like this that has earned Congress its low satisfaction rating with voters! (not corporations or Wall St).
@TIME I am all for forgiveness and second chances up to a point. The pattern that has emerged here seems to reflect spousal abuse!
@MarthaSugalski Beautiful Princess Holden of Orlando looks ready for her carriage ride home. So glad she fits in her car seat!  Rejoice!
@eonline NOTE TO MEDIA:  Leave Kate alone!  She looks wonderful.  Most women have a post-baby bump, especially the day after giving birth!
@msnbc I would fire everyone in Congress in a heartbeat. They have forgotten that they work for the voters, not Wall St. or lobbyists!
@Nightline And yet we have homeless families and high levels of hunger among the unemployed, underemployed, elderly and children!
@StarJonesEsq Yes, Weiner will continue this behavior for the foreseeable future. In my opinion, he should withdraw from the mayor's race.
@WSJ I agree with total replacement of every member of Congress. They have forgotten who they work for - individual voters, not Wall St.
@nytimes There will always be a place in society for Network TV. Some people can only afford basic cable service, and cannot afford Netflix.
@eonline @KourtneyKardash And why is this relevant or important?
@TMZ And your point? Why didn't you mention that George Zimmerman is Hispanic? What does the subject of race have to do with this incident?
@MarthaSugalski Bless you Mom.  I don't know any other Mother who could successfully nurse triplets.  You are the best, Martha!
@MarthaSugalski I admire you Martha.  When do you sleep?  Your babies are blessed to have you for a Mother!
@CBSNews I think it will depend which state.  I don't know how much change will be make to Florida's "Stand Your Ground Law."
@nprnews America - let's find out what Western Europe is doing right!
@nprnews long over due.  It's clear that rapes in the military have been swept under the rug for far too long.  Independent process needed.
@msnbc I've seen too much already!  The media has worn me down.  It's time to move on.
@HuffPostWedding @HuffingtonPost In light of the bad manners displayed by many wedding guests, I think it's highly appropriate!
@guardian Dependent on the provisions in the local land use laws there may be an opportunity to modify the design to meet community desires!
@WillieGeist That's the way parenthood works, Dad!
@russpartyof4 @WillieGeist It only gets worse from here Dad!  Getting fired is the easy part.  Wait until some young man steals their heart!
@msnbc After a time for discussion, it's now time to move on, stop looking back, and look forward to changes we can make in our community.

@MarthaSugalski Sounds like the babies are doing good, and that all the anesthesia has worn off (ouch).  Did I miss the boys names?
@MarthaSugalski What adorable little guys. I can't believe how big they are. They look full term!
@The_Bumps Yes, Triplets, I agree that both you and your Mom "rock."  I'm sure that your Dad "rocks" too!  I'll be following you as you grow
@The_Bumps Welcome to the world triplets. I have been tracking your journey since your Mom announced you were on the way in January. &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3
@MarthaSugalski Baby C is indeed a Warrior. I love the photo of you and her bonding; so precious and sweet. &lt;3

@MarthaSugalski  You looked wonderful on the 5pm News last night.  Forever a news anchor even when nearing the finish line carrying triplets
@MarthaSugalski There will be plenty of "Big Brother" opportunities available for Maxwell when he comes home to see the "bumps."
@MarthaSugalski Praying for your comfort, and a safe delivery for you and the babies, Martha.  I keep checking Twitter and WESH for updates.
@MarthaSugalski  Contractions seem to indicate "no extra space in the womb."  Prayers for a safe delivery for you and the bumps!
@MarthaSugalski  My thoughts and prayers are with you and your family as you continue your journey with the babies. Blessings on all of you!

@MarthaSugadlski Martha, I have been tracking the status of your precious babies since you announced the triplets were on the way!
