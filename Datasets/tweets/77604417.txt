My food was poisoned again today at McDonald's on North 1st street, in San Jose, California. I beg you Americans to do something about it before things get out of hand. @FBISacramento @TheJusticeDept @FBISanFrancisco @Interior @StateDept this is the 10th year. I'm tired.
You American people still have time and opportunity to deal with this issue. I beg again, kindly do something about it.
Now! I hereby beg every American person who has the opportunity to read my tweets to help me beg @tim_fargo and his men to leave me alone. One can only take but so much. I beg of you Americans, help me beg @@tim_fargo and his men to leave me in peace.
They keep attacking me by poison. If I should act now what the American people will begin to say would be "he is a black immigrant from Africa who came to kill us."
When I travelled to Nigeria in 2018 and was seeing a woman he paid my landlord and his son to put 'magun' in my body. I'm not a gay. I'm straight. Even if I'm gay I'd never have anything to do with such demented and dark character as @tim_fargo
When @tim_fargo talks about love people don't understand the kind of love he talks about. Everything points to the case of a jealous lover. He gets crazier whenever I talk with a woman.
I'm not a gay and I won't turn myself to gay because of @tim_fargo
From Florida to California won't take him more than 1 week by air. Why don't you tell him to come and do it himself? He will not. Do you know why? He knows the consequences.
I wonder why you are so stupid to the extent that you have to damn the consequences of your actions for the peanut that @tim_fargo pays you.
While some people are winning Nobel prize in reward for their contribution in advancing the world, some are jumping from one restuarant to another with poison in their bid to poison a human being to death. Shame!

And you still came with your poison.
As they say, experience is the best teacher. Perhaps I should assist you to pray that you find what you seek/ succeed in this enormous venture. Remember! You will recall how much I tried at avoiding you. Even as far as going to north 1st street to have my meal.
For a person who murdered sleep there's a kind of problem he/she will have &amp; they will prefer death to life but God will say 'no! It's not yet ur time. Continue to rock ur life.' Even when they attempt to commit suicide, pple will discover and save them even as they live in agony
Even experienced hunters know that it's not every animal they see while they are on game hunting in the bush they must kill. Continue!
There are people on earth who are for God as the Engineers box of work tools is for the engineer. Such people are Angels in human form. The day you make a costly mistake and kill any of them will be the day you have murdered sleep and will sleep no more.
Just one miserable man due to his self-interest keep causing problems for almost everybody in America yet people have refused to receive sense.

@DemolaRewaju All that still didn't earn him any point in regard to the debate. In short the failure of both top contending presidential candidates to debate simply shows how dubious, unserious, and unprepared for leadership he, @atiku and @MBuhari are.
Remember! President Mahammadu Buhari is in charge of governing Nigeria now.
Nigerians should stop using APC's VP candidate, @ProfOsinbajo and PDP's VP candidate, @PeterObi to sell @MBuhari and @atiku to the Nigerian. In a case of win at the general election by any of them, the presidential candidates will be in charge. Not their VP.

@tim_fargo is disturbing me for nothing. He blocked all my jobs for no reason. He's just a common impostor. He doesn't have the capacity to do anything good for any person. He has only violence in stock to dispense.
If you claim to work for a person, yet for 10 years you have never sat down and still won't sit to talk with them in regard to the job, then you don't work for them. You are on your own.
I just decide to say it today. It's not as if I'm worried. Not at all. After all my plan is different now. Just that if I were @tim_fargo I'd never take part in a thing that's as shameful and disgraceful as this matter.
How could a person say he's handling a matter, yet he has no information in that regard? Thus, in order to stay relevant to his audience, resort to giving out fake information every day,  which now run into years [false relevance]? All the Information have been misleading! Sigh!
I strongly doubt if the person @tim_fargo claims he works for actually know him, and if the both of them have ever sat down to discuss this matter, which he claims he's handling since year 2010.
Whenever I say something the way it is some people in some quarters will begin to say I'm not humble. Now! Tell me, what responsible person repeatedly dish out fake information daily, year-in year-out?

Remember! We are not the same. I've a Ph.D. degree. And I know my onions. You are just bachelor degree holder who is worse than a High School certificate holder. I've spoken. It's up to you to sit down and do something with your life.
Use this time you waste in poking your nose into matters you know nothing about to study your discipline [computer science], so, you could be marketable. Stop wasting your time on frivolity. Be serious with your life and stop finding solace in my matter.
It's obvious that no company will hire you as degree holder because you don'tknow your onions. So, let me advice you. You said you studied computer science in the UK, yet you can't even run a simple computer program. Don't argue what I said because I know.
@tim_fargo a spent and frustrated American, who has never been to Nigeria but talks with both sides of his mouth will talk to you on issues about families in Nigeria and you pick that up and begin to post fake information on social media.
Godspower omoruyi Samuel, you talked about friends and family rejection. You seem to be suffering from bipolar disorder. Are you sure you are alright? Why do you talk about things you neither know about nor understand?
God is not silent in giving me job(s). He has given more than enough job(s). In regard to killing Tim Fargo and his criminal gang, perhaps he's giving him time to repent and turn over a new leaf.
So, Godspower Omoruyi Samuel, in view of what I enumerated above which God did you say is silent about my situation? Silent in giving me job(s), not just job. Or silent in killing @tim_fargo and his criminal gang that are disturbing me?
... Bay area City jobs, etc. He has tried his hardest to block my present hustle (security jobs) but was not successful.
Remember! He also blocked the 2 opportunities I had to teach at the University of California in Berkeley. 1 opportunity to teach at the University of Florida in Tampa. The several opportunities I had to work with the UN in NY. World Bank ...
Also he read all e-mail messages sent to me and my responses in that regard. So, he sent his agents to block both opportunities. I saw them. They didn't pretend about it.
As your already know Tim Fargo @tim_fargo tapped my phone and hacked all my e-mail and social media accounts. So, he did listened to my phone conversations with officials at both organizations who called my phone to talk with me.
On October 17, 2018 Vivid Events Group, 3340 Walnut Ave. Suit 280, Fremont, CA 94538 (I didn't like the company anyway) invited me to meet with Tanya Groover responsible for talent acquisition, for interview as a Manager at 01:00 PM.
I returned to California from Nigeria on August 31, 2018. On October 11, 2018 the Hiring Director at Hart Group, 5500 Stewart Ave. #151, Fremont, California invited me for interview for the position of Benefits Coordinator at 09:45 AM.
Instead of making some erroneous statements it's better for a person who don't know what's happening or is pretending not to know to keep quiet. After all nobody invited you to comment on a case that's beyond you capacity.

One agent of darkness somewhere in the abyss, who has severally attacked me with his wizardry keep telling me to obey devine instruction. That instruction is that I should give my hard earned money to him.

Some of them bears Dr on the internet profile but remain ordiry in real life. A child of God don't lies. Does not use the Bible to defruad people.
I've read the Bible from Genesis through Revelation for over 25 times. I'm an academic doctor. So, I wonder why you think I'd let one illiterate person who began preaching the Bible simply to feed/ fill his empty stomach to deceive me.
To be candid, I don't listen to the likes of you who selfishly preach Christ, seeking who to deceive. I do understand, serving God in truth and spirit is a very difficult thing. Hence so many of you are going astray.
Come to think of it, what role have you played or are you playing to stop people who have disturbed and keep disturbing a simple minded man, an innocent person? You are either subtly in support of them or you've always felt it's not your business.
I've never read in the Bible where God told a person, "If give me money, then I'll solve your problem." Or "If you give me money, then I'll give you job."
That's simply your imagination. You may never know how intimate the person you talk about is with God. That a person refused to deal with self-interested individuals who pretend to preach Christ but for selfish reasons doesn't mean the person is not intimate with Christ.

I left for Canada. They told Canadian authorities that they want me back in the United States. Three times I returned to Nigeria, and they didn't let me stay.
But I'd often take a look at the people making the fake promises. Promises that were accompanied by life threatening violence, and humiliation, I knew it's won't happen.
California city jobs such as Daly City, Fremont, Hayward, San Francisco,  Los Altos, and United Nations in New York, etc, which I wrote their recruitment exams and performed exceptionally well, they said "no, we will give you job." And blocked all the wonderful opportunities.
If I were in the classroom at the University of California in Berkeley, or University of Florida in Tampa with a PhD degree for 8 years I'd be pushing for to become a full professor at this time. But the agents of darkness in America said it's their responsibility to give me job.
Happy independence day celebration to Nigeria.

@DemolaRewaju @inecnigeria I agree with you in regard to standard - public record of integrity. But Did you say Humphrey Nwosu organized the worst election? Why did you say that? Humphrey Nwosu organized the best election that Nigeria ever had. Please don't attribute what Gen. Babangida did to him.
@DemolaRewaju @inecnigeria Yes! In every industry or even in homes there's always a deviant. The man you talk about is simply a deviant but still better than choosing a clergyman for INEC job. All clergymen in Nigeria outside the Catholic Church are deviants.
@DemolaRewaju @inecnigeria Sorry, I meant teachers are better suited for INEC job. Remember! The person who organized the freest and fairest election in Nigeria was a professor. Teachers just have a different orientation when it comes to money.
@DemolaRewaju @inecnigeria VCs are best suited for INEC job.
@DemolaRewaju @inecnigeria What clergy persons do want to be Returning Officers? Are you a Nigerian? Perhaps only Catholic Reverend Fathers can fill that void. All the other pastors you see in Nigeria are worse than Nigeria police in soliciting for bribe.

Tim Fargo @alphabetsuccess @Tim_Fargo a crack addict who's always under the influence of cocaine was able to use all of you. What a shame?
The most shameful thing is that they didn't know it even though I've been saying it since year 2010. Unfortunately, before they could know who he is, he has dealt me a serious blow by blocking all the wonderful job opportunities I had in the United States. I'm very disappointed.
Exactly what I've been saying since 2010 &amp; nobody listened to me. It beats my understanding how a crack addict was able to use American Marine, Boston, &amp; Oakland police, numerous African pastors, etc who ought to know &amp; do better, to do his bidding against a law abiding person.

@VivianJonathano There's nothing pity, naive, narrow minded or ignorance about it. We are saying the same thing perhaps in different ways. It all suggests the President couldn't have hand in the DSS invasion of NASS, yesterday. That's the message.
You are in Nigeria basing your analysis on information you got from a liar, and a brute. A person who don't have anything to offer to himself let alone another person his jealousy and envy of drove him to subject the person to untold violence and serious hardship in the US.
Some people make me laugh out loud. It appears the difficulty in Nigeria has got so many Nigerian people blinded to facts.
It beats my understanding how an old white man keeps acting toward me, a black man, like a boy who had developed a love infatuation with a pretty girl.
What does he want from me that made him vow that if he can't have me then he would destroy me?
A white man who sent money to my landlord's son to put 'MAGUN' in my body, a man, so I no longer have sex with my girlfriend, is he a normal person? I'm not a gay (my respect to the gay community). What does he want from me that he keep stalking me for over 8 years?
@henryshield @bukolasaraki @MBuhari Do you think what happened at NASS, Nigeria was the handiwork of the President or that of some power hungry official(s) in APC who are attempting to usurp the powers of the President?

Some Nigerian preachers own jets. Christ The Lord only rode on a colt. And the colt wasn't his.
Is a supposed preacher of the gospel who owns a polytechnic, fashion designing school, a hospital, etc. a preacher of the word of God or a businessman?
@IsiakaSteven Christ neither forced anyone to give money nor asked his disciples to fight the people who don't have money to contribute for kingdom advancement.
What you fail to realize is it's going be a different ball game for your children and all what you left behind when you die. Continue!
You are investing for your children through fraud but have never given it a thought how your they will manage your investments when you die. Money got through fraud from the poor will no doubt return to the real owners in the end.
Rather than preach Christ the Lord as he ought be preached, you are busy chasing money, and even making enemies in the process. God have mercy!
