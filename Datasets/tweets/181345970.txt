@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends 	@seanhannity 	funny thing is...for a self proclaimed big intellect...#TrumpFailures hasn't said anything new or Twitter same in a very very long time... the Russian brainwashing must not have settled deeply enough for multiple unique expression
@realDonaldTrump #trumpspeak o educated people is like nails dragged along a chalkboard. Many of your supporters enjoy it, the beer drinking,wife beating,child neglecting, wannabe marital cheaters, truck driving,football gathering morons, even though they dont really understand how poorly u speak
@realDonaldTrump can you imagine a future world where people that don't "have" are herded into an area and prevented from thriving.Controlled by a group that has no compassion for their plight.Imagine how #Palestinians feel in the concentration camp created by #israel &amp;the USA
@realDonaldTrump you sound like a tweaker caught in his own quicksand life. your drugs are lies, your truths nonexistent. but you are entertaining in a Punisher's foe kind of way.
logic is an enemy and truth is a menace to Donald J. Trump. A self described genius, a self made man, smarter than all others. None being truth, his only failure is not being able to make the USA the dictatorship he craves above all else. @realDonaldTrump is the menace &amp; enemy
@realDonaldTrump prison hosts will be better	with a great cell mate. 	it could be called Trump National Prison. Big beautiful walls! wonderful iron work. 		I can hope, cant I?
@realDonaldTrump the best you can do?	The master conman,liar in chief,educationally challenged to boot? Lmfao, what a great respite from all the smart hardworking presidents I have seen in my life. nothing normal about you. fetal alcohol syndrome maybe. I heard your mom was a heavy drinker...
@realDonaldTrump ...as Congress listens to big pharma heads say how they are doing the best they can.being grilled in committee exclusively by members that have taken tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contribs.the #1percent again trying to shine up their shitpile of money at our expense
@WHPressSec is so fOS to say Cohen should not be heard because he is a liar...the same metric would bag @realDonaldTrump totally, boxed bagged and dumped in the trash where he belongs.
@realDonaldTrump well,now we know you have 	 ever waved a flag on the side of a city street for the veterans walking proudly by.	never understood how we as a nation hold our freedoms under the constitution so dear on this date. probably you do understand that rules and laws were creates by the 1%
@JimLivio @ida_skibenes @realDonaldTrump in those days they didn't know drinking while pregnant created mental health issues in their offspring. #DonaldTrump is a great example of the negative effects of alcohol on a pregnancy
@MLPast1620 @HonestyMatters2 @RiskAlert @BistyCSRoss @ChetPowell @realDonaldTrump excellent sentiment but in our new world order throwing a tomato though appropriate can be construed as a threat...booing too in trumpworld...lol
#America was founded by wealthy men that didn't  want anyone to make rules for them.Using words like "for the people,by the people" to make it seem just and fair. #1percenters make the rules for their benefit, rarely focusing on the #99percent unless it brings good press. wakeup
@realDonaldTrump repeat again until you turn blue, but the facts will come out one day. 	I would bet that many "#fakenews" items will turn out to be "#truenews" in the end. you are a side show now with a minor role as a teaching moment of American history. your #putinist reign over in time
@netanyahu and @realDonaldTrump show there true inner worth by courting racist groups to hold power. Netanyahu's govt hold #Palestinians in concentration camp like conditions hoping they go extinct. #trump uses dividing tactics hoping his opposition disappears. unfortunate ideals
@realDonaldTrump even the people you get to write these more involved tweets are clueless about black history, there were no black leaders in our nation's infancy only people used as tools for monetary gain, traded among so-called leaders.changing the factual narrative will not cloud the truth
@realDonaldTrump @JussieSmollett my point exactly, you put down America and disparage all people not on your broken #trumpbus,  that #DonaldliarTrump hates when other people do what he does most is equally glaringly apparent. People hate most what they dont like about themselves. your inner fears must be awesome
@realDonaldTrump my hope that if the #MuellerReport is locked away, a real patriot will unlawfully remove and publicize the document in its entirety.jail time would be a badge of honor in those circumstance.only fitting since Russia helped put a dishonorable man in the whitehouse
@realDonaldTrump calling you, a reporter wouldn't know if he was getting @realDonaldTrump  or #lyingDonaldTrump. So what would be the point, when all the self-serving people around you constantly serve you up.your business is based on illusion and delusion promoted by you.your presidency the same
@realDonaldTrump anyone that calls people names as regularly as you do cannot be believed. stop being a verbal bully and be a man, then maybe perceptions about you may change in time. they may not though as your demeanor is deeply rooted in your self worth
@realDonaldTrump mount Rushmore should be changed with you added a few hundred feet below,  smaller, and to the left with your eyes downcast like a child being disciplined. America needs to remember what toxicity in office looks like. Your image can "Be Best" in that future roll
@realDonaldTrump did you actually have people ask the Japanese Prime Minister to nominate you for a Nobel peace prize?Just because #RealPresidentObama won one?do you even get how pathetic that is?maybe Stormy should nominate you for being best, but I doubt you were.real swave lol
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump one of the wall realities is the fact that none of the perfect scenarios waved around by #trumpwall #trump   	will happen, people will sneak in, rich groups will smuggle drugs and guns, sex trafficking will continue, and we will only have another unfinished financial boondoggle
@realDonaldTrump can you imagine the books classes and movies made about you one day?they are not going to be nice.maybe you should have stayed in your make believe prior life where no one could do badly toward you or you would hammer them down	 where you could lie over and over again to be heard
@realDonaldTrump!I can't believe you are a puppet of fox news peeps. wtf,we hired a president and got a puppet with strings attached to #foxnews and #putin but no so much U.S. citizens.if this was a comedy show called Trump and friends it would be a big hit!as reality,not so much
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump have a great 2019 worrying, wondering, expecting shit to happen. No friends just sycophants, everyone around out for themselves except when they tell you what you want to hear. #Hannity must laugh at the power he has over this weak willed, morally corrupt #PresidentTrump.impeach
@realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson obeying laws has never been important to any #Trump. you come up with words, idk...out of your ass, because they look good from far, but far from good.
@TruthfulNate bot
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse looks like a big brain deal.	sign it, let people work, and then start ranting as usual to you educationally challenged political base. this is an amazing time to be political!
@realDonaldTrump I see your everyone should have a happy peace filled life words don't include honorable career law enforcement personnel or their wives. rant and rage when you are caught with your panties pulled down Donald, it still won't stop you from being a pussy.
@realDonaldTrump you remind me of my ex, constantly telling untruths to people that don't know the facts to try to sway opinion into your thought process. she became my ex for all her babble. you will become my ex for all yours.
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump empty trump words mean unless someone deserves to be called names or berated	unless they are journalists that follow facts and print truths. empty big brain words, unfortunately  untrue.
@realDonaldTrump an awful lot of Americans are having a hard time financially. I think your numbers are as cooked as your books and your big brain.
@realDonaldTrump you can fool some of the people all the time, including yourself it seems.
@realDonaldTrump #Trump  getting boring, more like a carnival freak show at this point,con artist lies and fear mongering to people that can least process fact from fiction.maybe you should try that at a top university,where people are actually educated a bit.not  people with a negative self view
@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump looks like white folks that drink beer buy guns beat their children dogs and wife. And their loving wives that have no place else to go.#Trump is getting boring,his supporters are now in the openly racist camp, soon he will be gone because America is about inclusion not division
@realDonaldTrump full of shit is the only thing that comes to mind #exectivetime guy
do you get that when the mega wealthy support a museum with 100million dollar donations to get there big beautiful names on buildings and deduct the full amount on their taxes that it takes away money from public works just for vanity,legally using tax laws created for rich folks
do you get that America first should mean we help the Americans that need help most, not hope that rich people getting more money will help instead of just be greedy. you are greedy, do you think others of your kind would do otherwise than you?
how many of the uninsured could have had lower medical rates so they could be included. do you understand that a percentage of Americans are homeless. do you know many American children go to bed hungry. have you ever seen the inside of a homeless shelter, and how unsafe they are
@realDonaldTrump I wonder if you can imagine how many teachers could have lifted instead of untaxing the wealthy. how many children we could have helped with preschool and early education. how many work programs we could have  started in rural areas to help people a oid poverty
@Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump clueless lady with no compassion for anyone but her own?
@realDonaldTrump to lie about yourself constantly shows an inner inadequate self image. you know you are an asshole and hope you can yell and thump and bluster so no one notices. but we notice, you are transparent in only that. soon your law breaking rule breaking will be transparent also.schmuck
@realDonaldTrump only an idiot replys this way to people that are talking about doing good things for the environment and future generations.understandable in one regard,it would put the spotlight on companies and corporations that are raping the land and stealing the future wellbeing of children
@Refinery29 I'm so sorry someone would do this to anyone...we live in a new age where honor and trust are not a given. The person that did this for groupfame is shallow at best and his life will probably follow his lead. just pisses me off when there are so many positive things to do in life
@realDonaldTrump you are like a fish flopping on a very big hook, trying to get back to your cozy personal pond. 	that you have no mechanism to see yourself as you are is glaringly apparent. ranting about your dislikes without owning your mistakes is what makes you look so weak.
@realDonaldTrump your illegal actions are being unearthed back to your youth.your profiting of  low paid foreign workers in jobs where you should have paid Americans living wages is legendary. you are not a dealmaker, you are a con man, your university proves it, your attitudes prove it, psycho!
@realDonaldTrump another brown nosed grifter.	kiss the golden trumpass	and help his friends rape america.	why is this the new normal?	how can a cheap egotist mold our government in his own image?	when the fires finally go out and the ashes are cold...what then?
@realDonaldTrump you wanted to be president to fill your ego and for the financial profit you might reap as other presidents have. you became president. now you show the world you never do what you say, always do what others report and kneel before people like Putin. you dont actually work for us
@realDonaldTrump @FaceTheNation @CBS yes oh great leader, we will enjoy! because we've learned there is always an "or else" if we cross you
@realDonaldTrump they should also remember your housing discrimination policies under you and your father's leaderahip of the #corrupttrump organization. rules were for other people, not the #trumpshits
@realDonaldTrump if #christians believe god wanted you to be president then you know something stinks in #christiandom.	although it is a man made religion as all religions are, the basic tenents of morality,compassion,honor, and others are truly lacking in @POTUS as they are in religious leaders
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends #foxnewstrumpBS has always found financial gain in stirring the #trumpshitsoup and baiting those with a bit less than a full deck to rouse the rabble.I think #TRUMP should be heard,but without the smokescreen put up by people with a financial stake,just honesty,if at all possible
@realDonaldTrump I get it,you believe you know more than every single person focused on any fact based analysis,of any subject. You believe it, that is the problem. As a child I knew early on that I did not need to know everything, because people are out there that find answers,its what they do.
@realDonaldTrump we expect uneducated statements like this from you. lucky your criminal family bankrolled you or you'd be standing around a barrel of burning trash in some homeless camp wondering why oh why is life  so unfair to you.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends self destruction and running away from responsibilities? not @realDonaldTrump 	illegal dealings and lies in business and personal affairs? not #DJT	angelic persona, wonderful humanitarian, compassionate anarchist? yes! as per @foxandfriends
@realDonaldTrump Happiness and Honor will rise like a wall.	if we	#JustDumpTrump
@POTUS @REFORM -#betsydevos backs rules promoted by wealthier Americans,segregating Americans into schools of richer and poorer children to maintain a low class of workers to support the needs of richer and super rich people.Why should they want to support lifting up all children
@realDonaldTrump So you hold America hostage with your gang of thieves now #WilburRoss #Wilburgets up and says he doesn't know why people dont just go out and get a loan as a gap measure for federal workers family needs. As a billionaire it is hard to imagine people with bad credit, or no credit
@realDonaldTrump "The president will talk to the American people on January 29th as he does nearly every single day,"White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said on Fox News Wednesday.	A shill fronting for a liar tells the truth for once.The words make you realize it will be self promotion only
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @POTUS  farts shouldn't be looked at badly.Hillary and Dems fart too you know. As a matter of fact I think their farts are way worse than mine. It's fake news that my farts are worse,everyone thinks my farts are good and have a nice aftertaste,all my great and loyal peeps say so
@realDonaldTrump there may be a time or two(maybe)where someone tried/tries to print a lie about you.straight up though, you deserve it for all the lies and petty insults you bring to the table.A learned man would think deeply and respond with educated discourse. You do not have those attributes
I try to follow the	 "God fearing" Republicans that drool over our dear leader #trump. They blindly follow back and then they read one of my posts putting him in the outhouse. Then they unfollow...love that shit!
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews A rat squealing on a crook, liar, and racist is a good rat.	@POTUS = the most vile form of being to ever hold the job.	#TrumpShutdown 	#russianTRUMP	#PUTINsBITCh	#greedytrump
@realDonaldTrump Americans as a whole represent Inclusion,thoughtful discourse,moderated tone during debate.We do not represent name calling,insensititivity to personal circumstance,tyranical gestures by leaders in temporary power. How is it correct to speak to people as our #POTUS does?#RESPECT!
@realDonaldTrump Build two walls about five miles apart, then we could put people between the two walls like #Israel has put the #Palestinians. Bad people could live there, financial  manipulators and thieves, politicians that are dirty, rapists and church pedophiles.	guess who'd be king?	#DJT
@realDonaldTrump it is amazing how simple it is to open government agencies for the biggest and worst offenders in America. bank loan paper processors and oil lease and drilling processors! no paper for the average Joe or Jane government worker, and no job for contractors. U-SuQ
Illusion
@realDonaldTrump knows the beneficiary of corruption is usually not the one to speak up,nor is a person using corruption for his own ends.Having corrupt people around a dishonorable person not only creates an allusion of personal corruption, but also justifies close examination
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump The USA stands for inclusion, honor, rules for the people written by the people.	Not just for the rich.Not just for white people.Not just for the well connected.If Donald Trump could even see,much less reach, this low bar he would have no trouble.He is the problem,not a solution
@realDonaldTrump I bet you are lying about the numbers	Even if you invited a hundred people which I don't think there were. Every person eating 10 burgers...how many burgers do you eat at one sitting? And since you were paying with your big bucks, couldn't you treat them to something more classy?
@realDonaldTrump If the USA was my house and I overspent and gave away future revenue to people just to make them like me, truth is I would not have the money to pay for my big beautiful wall. I need the money to pave my,feed my,fix my,hospitalize my,and make nice with my neighbors with a potluck
@realDonaldTrump And you are such a classy guy...we never knew how classy you were from TV alone...now being president, you show the world how classy you really are. A very special class of classy! Maybe the only one in the whole history of mankind classy.	 Burgers and pizza in the whitehouse!wtf
@realDonaldTrump At what point are threats against people and countries advantageous? Never! All it does is embolden those with the darkest agendas. Turkey cares about Turkey, #China cares about China. America used to care about all people,humanitarians and and economically helpful. What a @POTUS
@SecPompeo @TamimBinHamad Crooks and thieves tyrants and fools...
@realDonaldTrump Jus sayin	,if you will pay and hide affairs with porn stars, and those are just the ones we know about.What would you pay for evidence of a hooker peeing on you in moscow. Would the USA be too high a price to Pay to shield your ego from a public shellacking?Putin doesn't think so
@realDonaldTrump Yay, let's support the Russian agenda! We've been against their agenda too long, what have they ever done to us, we are big and powerful and they are...going to be power filled tyrants, like our dear @POTUS POTwants to be
@realDonaldTrump Like sharing a silk tapestry by a skunk
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Words you promote in exclusive self-interest don't carry the weight they would carry used by someone that actually has compassion, actually is concerned,and has a bit of genuine self worth. You have none and your words ring hollow. You give nothing and and take more than you need
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Algorithms point to your resignation somewhere around August 3rd. It is ok, you will be fine, pence will pardon you, and in disgrace you will find a Howard Hughes type retirement with only wonderful stories about you played on your in house entertainment system, ai says your fkd
@realDonaldTrump dark.Border is probably the least pressing issue the USA has right now.Listing medical coverage,social security maintenance,jobs for the under served,veteran care,#trumptarrifs,are all more important and impacting millions as is the #TrumpShutdown.	What We get? a childish tantrum
@realDonaldTrump Good clean fun is fine with me.	Getting your jollies from spewing lies, disparagement and condescension is not ok. Your house may be white, but your heart is very datrk.
@realDonaldTrump not true.The economy rules crime.Poorer people whose only original crime is falling for the desire to want things foisted upon them by media and large corporations, do not have avenues to good paying jobs.Our country is based on take as much as you can,give as little as can.
@realDonaldTrump How pathetic.	There have always been scores of people in the whitehouse.	Experts and aides and more 		I've heard even your family talks about your poor choices behind your back, never to your face. 	Running America like you ran your businesses cannot end well
@realDonaldTrump The wall is a lazy man's choice for a difficult problem. Exactly like	 "just say No!" was for drugs. Thoughtful discussion to create a means to a positive inclusive end is quite remote from the slogans and current lack of dialog.There are solutions, and they may or may not appear
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @JesseBWatters @greggutfeld I like the way your mental illness flows in your tweets as you disparage and lie to make yourself look good.There will be law school classes about you but you will never get your name on a law school unless you buy one.Kinda like inviting yourself to be a member of your golf club
@realDonaldTrump Great line for our fellow Americans	Elections have consequences.	Everyone needs to vote this Turkey off the platter, we don't need a ham in the White House...and damn if this would have been more(gulp!) Palatable at Thanksgiving
@realDonaldTrump is deaf and death to facts, has created financial hardship for Americans with his #TrumpShutdown2018 and yet rich bankers get him to open the IRS dept that benefits their cash flow. Golly banks lose money? We can't let that happen says #trump. But everyone else?
@realDonaldTrump 	America is a vast country of diverse ethnicity that grew from personal risk, hard work, and creative problem solving. Our people should benefit from the wealth of knowledge held in trust by all.Yet only the well off are elevated and coddled, where the many need.
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump I'm sure the meeting where big banks and mortgage lenders got the IRS to reopen for them only was a great gathering of people that don't need a paycheck, working for people that can afford to buy shares in said institutions(and also don't need a paycheck). trumpers smilin?
@realDonaldTrump Using emergency funds to make Americans whole from previous disasters is brilliant!I am so glad we used all the funds necessary to make every Americans life that was damaged by disasters great again. Puerto Rico Texas California Florida S.C. Georgia all good again? Wtf r u thinkn
RT @Refinery29: Nagoya, Japan is home to one of the largest lowrider communities in the world. https://t.co/MC5VbXYZ1a
@realDonaldTrump With your personal history of criminal intent @POTUS,you should full well understand that any rule or wall will be bypassed by those intent on doing so. Like construction collusion with organized crime,blocking new tenants by looking at skin color,like playing the USA 2 b elected
@realDonaldTrump What a farce	Any learned person with honor and high morals would never support a low moral, no honor, dysfunctional leader.That you cannot accept your many failings is glaring proof of a mental problem that is an unfortunate side effect of your dishonorable life.Spin and lie?stfu
@realDonaldTrump I know, right?	could be watching your big tv, or my favorite, twittering!	How cares about poor Americans having their lives in turmoil when all you want is big beautiful wall to keep out every drug dealing terrorist in the world. Screw those greasy cheeseburgers! And fQ trump
@realDonaldTrump With a fraction of the money you e given to the rich and ultra rich, we could have had amazing infrastructure to process and utilize some of the wonderful people that just want to be a part of the lawful American dream. Instead we cage children and send some back home to die.
@realDonaldTrump Your thoughts must always borderline on criminal from your years of living by #Trump family values that you would deem writing like this appropriate.	You are a blot on the history of the USA that will never be cleaned
@realDonaldTrump You are an original sinner and that's for sure
@realDonaldTrump relate to this if you will	#Groceries	#Gasoline	#Childdaycare	#Publicschoollunch	#Medicalinsurance	#Rent	#electricity	#Water and #sewer	#Repairs	#Flu	#Pets	#eldercare	#communitysupport	These are shutdown casualties for two of my friends...	Glad @potus can relate
@realDonaldTrump Your memory and facts don't always,well actually never, match up. If the @nytimes repeated one of your lies as truth,as an inside joke, you would point to them and say "see, it must be true"		Like a foolish addled uncle with no friends and all u have is your mind to keep co with
@realDonaldTrump I have a bet with a friend you will lie 11 times in your address he says 8...my wife says 23 times...		How many times will you lie...can you let me know so I can change my bet...?
I understand a Christian organization's committee has proposed an new chapter for the bible called	"The book of Trump"	@realDonaldTrump 	#christian	If true, it shows the nature of man's egocentric bible origins.imagine if in a thousand years dim-witted people believe it as gospel
@JordanUhl Kind of almost like a #trump lie, no way it could be ignorant math, must be alternative facts?
@realDonaldTrump thanks for helping sbut down record numbers of coal fired power plants in your first two years in office. I know,its just another thing you lied about, but this one is working for the better for a change https://t.co/a50ipyctHB
@realDonaldTrump You Donald Trump, child king wannabe, are the biggest threat to every American's future, every democratic country's future, and the future of the middle east. When you stopped America from leading by democratic example, and pulling your deal breaking antics on the world stage
@realDonaldTrump Funny, this looks like a horror movie advert!
@realDonaldTrump The #trumpshutdown problem could be fixed with Impeachment.
@realDonaldTrump But your violations were oooogeee.	And your actions in violation to a marriage bond. One a fine can take care of, one will never be fine no matter what you do. All you are for future positive thinkers is a great example, of what not to be, say,or do.
@realDonaldTrump @SpoxDHS @CNN @TSA I am also a proud member of the opposition party.Any good American would ne opposed to the lying,cheating,scheming things the @GOP does to protect their trump #superpowers. Even if you are a direct reflection of @POTUS and lie cheat and steal, what he does must be un42N8 to u too
Should be unrealDonaldTrump @realdonaldtrump mocks the leader of India for funding a library. Saying it is a small fraction of what the USA spends (on killing, bombing,protecting strongmen that deal in opium) We are living in an Orwellian novel,where the horse's ass is the ruler
focus on the big money players that are making a killing each time someone in the #TrumpResign administration says something #manuchin  about the financial state of being in the USA.easy to imagine debts being paid by manipulations.Most of @POTUS help is crooked, corrupt grifters
@realDonaldTrump wondering how many of your followers are like me,just want to keep an eye on you,don't support you one iota,just watching.	It's like the old saying about keeping your enemies close because if you can't watch them they can do more damage.50+million followers w/.002% likes avg?Post
@AndrewEHopkins1 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @foxandfriends @FoxNews @seanhannity @IngrahamAngle And have a great day! Aloha...
@AndrewEHopkins1 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @foxandfriends @FoxNews @seanhannity @IngrahamAngle Yes you read the part about the Friday night vote, very good!	The president won fair(well, not fair) and square.	America should now be able to vote on impeachment as per my post.
@AndrewEHopkins1 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @foxandfriends @FoxNews @seanhannity @IngrahamAngle Irrational responses are to be expected. Many people never really made it in school and reading is not their best skill. Read original post. Wait. Breathe. Read it again.
@AndrewEHopkins1 @realDonaldTrump Impeachment is not a do-over. But thanks for the opinion.	@realDonaldTrump @POTUS	@foxandfriends @FoxNews @seanhannity @IngrahamAngle 	Will be sure to appreciate it.		And pence enjoys his raise while good people fear a financial struggle during 	#TrumpShutdown
@realDonaldTrump Impeaching would be easy if we had a Friday night nationwide electronic vote. But in all seriousness you know you don't do the job you e been "hired" to do...that leaves only one option, as the old Donald Trump used to say "you're fired!"
@realDonaldTrump @cvpayne The thaw with #China helped elevate the world's economy. True they don't play fair. In truth America wanted all the benefits of the #Chinese labor market within a controlled cage environment, fair?We must realize that this world is small now,working together a must. Words&lt;threats
@realDonaldTrump This is the president of the United States best use of time right now. To say a child was elected @POTUS is an insult to the children and future leaders of the world. A great, truly bestest example of how not to lead when opportunity presents itself
A congressman calls a friend and says Govt will spend this money. You should apply for it. Friend says I don't have a business that does that.Congressman says that's ok just apply,we will work it out. Friend says is that illegal?congressman says" it's just Biz, we do it allatime"
@POTUS is like a disease flowing through vulnerable minds,using @FoxNews to help spread the harmful effects through a country that has serious government problems right now.We do need things taken care of.We do need an inclusive Govt.What we have now is Govt football w/no winners
@realDonaldTrump If @POTUS led by positive discourse and relied on experts instead of grifters for advisors.	Sex lies and videotape are your legacies
@realDonaldTrump Lies tainted any good results.	@POTUS consistancy in honor and truthfulness lacking positive merit.		America is now a perceived reflection of one man that does not reflect the blood sweat tears and hard choices this country has invested in a future that does not match our reality
Mega wealthy @realDonaldTrump should finance the border wall himself.he could put his name on it every 5o feet. Then he could let his wall co. go bankrupt and not even pay for it.
@realDonaldTrump Repeat it till you're blue(lol) in the face.	Lies,schemes,bs
@realDonaldTrump Stop beating this dead animal, the many ways of trump's wall too numerous to count. Next he will want aliens to pay for it with  an immigration fee. Or maybe space aliens,  for such a genius he is not mentally stable
@realDonaldTrump Finally,a Republican with balls, doesn't have to bow down for political reasons to trump's  insanity,Comes out and tells the truth about @POTUS on the night before the democratic Christmas.That there is an adult  in the @GOP is great.Almost like an extra Democrat, lol
@realDonaldTrump The people you have put in the jobs have been grifters, rich greedy people helping themselves, foreign agents and the like.What makes you think giving you carte blanche to do more damage is a good idea except to people of a similar ilk.Thinking Americans must #resist
@realDonaldTrump Low gas prices are a direct result of the world's economic engine slowing...not using gas...lower prices		Your economic winners, are losers in disguise
@realDonaldTrump A great deal for America is any deal where your part of the deal is to leave quietly without blaming other people for your nonsense.	Don't get what you want =those Democrats.Your guys don't get elected=those damn supporters that didn't vote	Your wife getting pissed you cheat=wtf!
@realDonaldTrump Trump shut down the government to promote his BIG idea. An idea that is no solution except in his mind. America needs protections to be sure. Like a mental/moral competency test for presidential applicants and their appointees for one, and Congress for that matter. #Resist
@CNNPolitics @morgfair His eyes, when he looks over the  documents,are always pointed to the signature space that has his name, even when holding it up to his face for a few moments as if he is reading it, his eyes never move, as a person's would that actually reads. Just saying.
@realDonaldTrump I wonder how @realDonaldTrump will take being fired.Will he incite violence among the hoards of shallow thinkers that support him?What amazing,really great,super intelligent excuse will he make?Track record alone can predict his legacy as opposed to an honorable  man's tributes.
@BetoORourke @sooze555 Ouch, that one about writing a number on their arms makes me want to cry.We can't come up with a better plan in the 21st century?How can we as a nation lead,when we're seen as a nation,staggering away from our own examples of leadership?My voice is small,but right now it screams!
@realDonaldTrump Using words (and your poor judgement) to put people that say truthful things down (ie: stating their considered opinion) in order to make believe it makes you look good is not rational. Only people with the same character flaw would give it credence is this country.  No one else.
@PatrickRandall @sooze555 Good shit dude...	To say you rock is an understatement!
@realDonaldTrump Respect your adversaries and strength can be yours. "Act as if" you are better and the weaker you become. Your words begin to lose meaning, your future becomes written for you, instead of by you
@realDonaldTrump You've laid your bet, now we'll see how the #dice rolls. There will be your threats and acts of intimidation which seemed ok to you on business deals, but this is the big time,where substance is mightier that bluster and people have seen all your tricks. Overcoming yourself? IDTS
@realDonaldTrump Politics on America is give and take	You are a giver and berater (that's a new one) what do you expect when the people that get in your way "politically" get shoved aside by a bully @POTUS you have not been an ally more like Lucy with a football and America is your Charlie Brown
America is a great nation of diverse people. As has happened in the past, we come together as one, in times of strife or need. We are not a reflection of one man, even though one man may be a reflection of many.@realDonaldTrump is just in the now,not in the forever @Potus will go
@KamalaHarris The foundation that  America was built upon has been shaken but not broken. We are a free and brave society willing to do right and come together as one, went circumstance requires it. We are not a reflection of one man, even though one man may be a reflection of many. Good&gt;evil
@BernieSanders So long as the rich and powerful are making rules for their benefit our only tool is the vote.The mechanisms in place to subvert our only tool means we need change. We should be able to vote as a nation on each law Congress proposes. Technology would allow a wkly Friday night vot
@Zionocracy @KimWeinberg8 Blinded by history the Israelis do not see themselves as concentration camp owners. But the Gaza strip is nothing more than that. Jews were never inclusive on their entire history, crimes explained away by self interest. At some point the status quo will become un42n8 for israel
@Tasreme @JonnyM421 Religion has always been created by powerful men to use as they see fit and change as their focus does.The dreams of an afterlife offered are no different than the dreams of a one job for life pension handed to Americans for years. No organization that reaps heavily is clean/pure
@realDonaldTrump A real leader, even a smart leader that is a slacker, would find the most qualified people to create the best possible changes, without political predjudice.
@realDonaldTrump Make decisions that help the 99 percent first.	Like tha great medical system	Or being an inclusive minded @POTUS like @POTUS44
@realDonaldTrump Your spin now doesn't match your previous words as usual
@realDonaldTrump Children being caged, mentally abused and dying are immoral.	A president whose personal life when held up to the light island has been immoral should not use the word to describe anything else without owning his mistakes.
@realDonaldTrump Yes, you are the only person the would day that, with the conviction of a person the doesn't understand the nuances of any given situation, and does things in a pro Russian manner
@realDonaldTrump Doing things is what you are paid for.	Having clear intent and thoughtful discussion with experts that are immersed in the subject should be a priority.making decisions for political reasons is not necessarily doing the right thing.Doing well is great, doing a #trump, not so much
If @realDonaldTrump floats a deal with #Democrats to get what he wants for his #Trumpwall	Remember that his track record on abandoning his responsibility in a deal is almost legendary now. Two faces yes, dishonest guaranteed. He looked great from far, but is far from great @POTUS
@realDonaldTrump Nice projection of your inner demons. Unimaginably feeble minded to not see these words reflect on you permanently
@realDonaldTrump They @BarackObama  @MichelleObama actually served with compassion and gave the best of themselves,that was possible within the framework of government and public discourse they inherited.More importantly they served community and country for a very long time prior.give em a break
@realDonaldTrump No @POTUS in the history of The United States of America has been right or error free during his tenure.	The humility and understanding needed for introspection and modification of changes made,is totally lacking when ones primary focus is personal gain or status.We will overcome
@realDonaldTrump Nothing but great news about @POTUS	Must be fake lol.	Soldiers can't be honest about their thoughts on trump. Especially to anyone in public.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS I guess this post was misunderstood  by people that have an...unusual grasp of reality. It was not about migrants or their children's deaths, it was a simple character observation based on my experience with people that cannot accept their situation when reality is unfortunate.
@realDonaldTrump It is an unfortunate side effect of a dysfunctional person when blame could be owned with remorse but instead is deflected and explained away. it never looks good from the outside,even though in a person's mind it may seem useful.@POTUS never had to accept blame for his actions.
@realDonaldTrump I Heard you had some collusion with a couple Russian ladies. What a man, big guy.
@realDonaldTrump @JesseBWatters hot in your seat?Even if you are tried and convicted you probably won't do jail time.	Grow some balls already. Can you imagine how many people that have no equity have to go to jail for small offenses that they cannot get 500, 1000 or a couple thousand for bail? Cruel stuff that!
@realDonaldTrump For rich people maybe. Hard to hear the poor people from your high position as all the greedy rich folks clamor for more. You rode in on someone else's hard work, added no value, just took value away
@realDonaldTrump It has nothing to do with ending anything ... and everything to do with trump and the greedy money grubbers that stand to profit from another government boondoggle.	It is not a swamp anymore,it is a cabal of people with no voice for fear of alienating people that are the filler
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Foolish agenda	So many things more important
@realDonaldTrump How much money do we have to give you to quite. A #gofundme would the money in no time
@realDonaldTrump What did he offer your family?	Grifter's creed is what's initially for me? Your deals are rotten from the inside. He probably offered to build your hotel in the middle of Beijing
@realDonaldTrump Your Tax returns make them	#Public	No pay increase for federal workers because you gave the money to people like yourself. You govern by reaction-no organized focus. You support a racist agenda because what? every leader of the free world is afraid of what bs is next from @POTUS!
No pay raise for federal workers, no pay for laid off federal contractors. Please try of pay for corporate leaders, senators and bloated staff. Plenty of big bucks for unskilled yes-people in his admin.	#yourtrump #trumpshutdown #trumptaxgiveaway	#financialcollusion	@POTUS
@realDonaldTrump truth is,I enjoy your lying,scheming,bullying rhetoric. Maybe America will get it out of its system. Life is not like football where there are always winners and losers.We have a loser for president now,we will soon have someone that will not be a winner or loser just a President
@realDonaldTrump Acting like a pharaoh has never ended well. All through history the lessons taught about subjugation,greed,lack of empathy, bullying,and self Interest apply to your state of the union. America wasn't broken, change was always before us, rational thoughtful spiritual but not mean.
@realDonaldTrump Let the coal co.panies resume mercury dumping. Let's allow car manufacturers to expand their pollution quotas. Letting rich people gorge at the government trough is a given
@realDonaldTrump Can you even imagine the storm you have unleashed in the middle east?Bail on allies	Support criminal leaders	Renege on deals made	Made Russian agression ok, the enemies of America bolder, Israel more vulnerable	Allowed the continued concentration camp imprisonment of palestinians
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Complaining about everything except what you like is not the manner of a great leader. Thoughtful introspection and meaningful ideas that promote change does more for a leaders stature. Having goals that do not help those that need help most is just a fraction above criminal.
@realDonaldTrump Any lie any time any reason	Always #Trump
@realDonaldTrump All the reasons you list will not be an answer for all the problems you list.	Period.These issues are complex and need thoughtful changes not a whitewash job by building a wall.Experts giving honest answers are what you need. You've been too disconnected from the American reality
No tweaks from #trump is very curious. I wonder der if someone stole his phone. Better still, I hope he is ok and nothing happened to him.
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump 	@foxandfriends 	@FoxNews @CNN 	Merry Christmas and let's give thanks for the wonderful tax cut given to the rich and well connected. All of America Hope's they van buy wonderful additional homes and take education funds for their children out of pocket $
@realDonaldTrump Maybe you should go buy an island and build your own country. You could bring people you don't like in to disparage and build a big beautiful wall around it.Maybe @FoxNews  will relocate there too,to bring all the positive news about you, to you. You could call yourself idk,Pres.
@realDonaldTrump Waa waa waa wall.	I want it now! Says the spoiled child in the big White House. If your daddy was still around he'd buy it for you
@FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @NoradSanta You folks are like supergrinches creating more heartache than smiles, more worry than confidence. If you both would just be quietly seen but not heard, or read about, that would be good.the world needs a break from your drama filled life.
@realDonaldTrump If you had a friend you would never be alone
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS 	#manuchin and the trump mafia may be manipulating the stock market in collusion with Russian organized crime, to shift more wealth to those that do not need it but are used to the wages of criminal intent.
@realDonaldTrump America is turning I to a worldwide embarrassment. Our friends and allies are embarrassed for us due to one man's misguided life and ideas.
@realDonaldTrump The only problem our country has is not supporting our citizens 110% with education medical security that is not measured in how much money a person or family has. Caused by rich(or wannabe rich) disconnected people making rules and decisions that ultimately only help themselves!
@realDonaldTrump @RT_Erdogan Middle east including Turkey is so corrupt, wait till you see how much money they ask for to continue the fight
@realDonaldTrump Laughable at the least.	Joke is on you Mr. PRESIDENT.	People that tell you that are looking for strokes from you, not prizes for intellectual thought.
@realDonaldTrump What a fool to think the easy idea is the best. Criminals smarter than you will circumvent any situation when there is a need.A wall,an iron curtain whatever, not happening. political look good is your only motivation,means you should have tried being president instead of being.
@realDonaldTrump Great people you'd hire, but most have zero experience in the jobs you give. You do this to make you feel smarter? What kind of person hires unqualified untested people to do these important jobs? You were unqualified and untested and you see what kind of nonsense that has been
@realDonaldTrump Face it, anything good you may do is so dipped in s__t from all the absolutely atrocious things that you've done that people have a hard time equated the words-	Donald Trump &amp; did something good
@realDonaldTrump @RandPaul #Mattis pissed on you like a big dog.	Arf arf little man
@realDonaldTrump When I was a child we wouldn't play with kids that act speak and play like you do. That you are an adult in years makes it all the more scary. You are what society has been warned about through history's lessons. A gift for #PUTIN but poison for America. Hopefully we will rebuild
@edjones1968 @realDonaldTrump You must be one of em edumacated people's to know how great trump is
@realDonaldTrump I wonder how many Russian shills like your posts to make you feel loved @POTUS. #Putin must be laughing with his criminally corrupt cronies at every tweet move you make. When was the last time you heard a Russian leader praise a #USA decision? Like never,until #trump's Syria move
@realDonaldTrump America under Trump stands with no country, except russia. That we forsake all the countries that have been at side for generations, and all the countries that were newly freed from the USSR's tyrany is a shame on us as a nation. For trump to say we are with you is laughable
@realDonaldTrump Favorite joke	Favorite idiot maybe	Worst thinker in that office you hijacked 	Most vile	Most likely to screwup royally	Favorite president... not even!
@realDonaldTrump You couldn't write fiction as bizarre as this administrations daily fits and starts. imagine the movie that will be made about this shitstorm we are living through.	One of the most remembered presidents will be trump for all wrong reasons		#trumpshutdown		#TrumpChristmasShutdown
@realDonaldTrump I understand that was a stack of blank Bill's staged for a photo OP. The first 13 photos looked pretty bad but he liked this one. Because he looked #PUTIN tough
@realDonaldTrump Oh how you sacrifice to do your work! Dismantle destroy destabilize demean debase, and that's just the d(s). Build up America's support system for all your supporters that hate big government but love those guvment checks. Help the bottom 50% for a change,trickle down not working
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Typos suck but if you can't u derstand the intent, it might matter more.
@realDonaldTrump Our great country must have priorigies. We  need to get an educated, selfless @POTUS in the White House. We have a man talking to one sector of society as if it was the only one. We have many real problems that effect all citizens below the 1 percent Donald Trump enriches.sad day
@realDonaldTrump Castles of tyrants need walls with spikes
@Pontifex Are you as small a fool as others that have come before you!?! To ask pedophiles in the church to hand themselves in was what, a hail mary?	Your organization has prayed on the sick, vulnerable, and defenseless for a thousand years and that's the best you can do to atone...
@realDonaldTrump @DHSgov Yes renaming something is always a great service to our country. Maybe you should name the White House the Funny Farm and get some white jackets too.
@realDonaldTrump You have started the beginning of a new age of world leader lawlessness, you will own the consequences when things deteriorate further in the middle east due to Russia and China filling the void you've created. Burning all the bridges the USA has created is no coherent policy
@realDonaldTrump Lol, your words mean so little in their booming silence. Meaningless drivel from a disconnected fool. Maybe if you had real friends you would be more humane, maybe if you had a pet other than your wives you would be more loyal
@realDonaldTrump Should never have been a priority for America to build a wall.Finding a way to be inclusive would have been money well spent.Many immigrants are and have been the basis for innovation and positive change. Hard working people that believe in the American dream &amp; a solid work ethic
@realDonaldTrump @and @POTUS Sorry @and
@realDonaldTrump On Twitter we can say fuck you you lying bitch. We can say that to Putin, Giuliani, Assad, Maduro, not even two cent Pence, we won't go to jail or be killed for speaking out against selfish tyrants and enablers like all these are. @and  a hearty fuck you @potus you lying bitch
@realDonaldTrump Americans need medical coverage without crazy deductibles.Have you seen how many people are homeless,Americans that are homeless.Maybe we should start at the bottom instead of spreading money around at the top.The only people benefitting are the people that don't actually need it
@realDonaldTrump Must be that back channel to Russia's #Putin working. No USA presence in syria = win for putin.	Can you imagine all the Russian deals trump will have after office?	Most corrupt pols take jobs from businesses they have helped. Trump will have businesses in a country he has helped!
@realDonaldTrump What? no tweeking on conspiracy crap tonight, bummer, ripoff,I follow you for your bs... I want bs from @POTUS !!!
@realDonaldTrump Go to sleep @POTUS tomorrow when you wake up, you will once again have a choice. To be as you are, or to be better, or even best.
@FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Seen but not heard would be good
@realDonaldTrump Maybe you should start a new reality TV program about @POTUS and the white house. It could be on every morning, Donald Trump(played by you!) could say anything he wants because it wouldn't be real, just a TV show. Wouldn't have to change anything except get cameras
@realDonaldTrump Most of your good people were bad people in disguise. 	Look Great from far...	But far from great!
@realDonaldTrump No wonder other presidents and Mrs. Clinton don't really want to speak to lying little Donald trump, an undisciplined punk
@realDonaldTrump Wishing you good luck in all your legal woes, NOT. But I am wishing the American people good luck and hoping you leave soon
@realDonaldTrump Anytime you hear a trump speak you have to ask yourself, is this a lie too.
@realDonaldTrump GOP backs the president out of fear,and yet they dream,pray,and hope for a strong GOP challenger in 2020 to get the idiot out of the Whitehouse.Secretly many believe the investigations will help to those ends.Very sad situation where half of congress dislikes him,other half too!
@realDonaldTrump The trump recession will be injurous to working class people. Economy's are interconnected, China down means USA is or will be down. It is like a slowing worldwide freight train...rolls easy until it stops...zero foresight all blustering untruths will bring bad results @POTUS
@realDonaldTrump Actually a moral man.	A god fearing man	A man with kindness in his heart		Would not have these problems
@realDonaldTrump We know...	All together folks! 	"Witch Hunt"		Lol lol lol you immature undisciplined   mobster wannabe
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Yup, Ken Starr gets all the info from #mueller's team because he did such a good job digging up all the sex acts during the Clinton impeachment attempt. Must have invites to every office discussion to say there is "No Evidence" or maybe it's just the pay heck for being on TV. LoL
@realDonaldTrump @marthamaccallum @RodBlagojevich @trishregan You are definitely not a chess player. Probably wouldn't understand checkers either. Your choices block all avenues of exoneration. Your words cripple you in ways that even I am embarrassed and I don't even like you or your admit istration of the wealth and might of the #USA
@realDonaldTrump Yes, too bad he got caught in the same wen you prowl in. The one where law and rules is for regular citizens but not for people like you that cam cherry pick and buy justice to order. The unfairness built in our system is not so apparent to the rich or well connected criminals
I guess we will see how corrupt #ZinkeResigns is by what company he helped(wink,wink)offers him the cushy big bucks no work job. One hand fills the other in dirty politics. Follow the money because it all ends up in someone's hand @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @foxandfriends @FoxNews
@uniquetresbyrn @realDonaldTrump @PeteHegseth @FoxNews @POTUS Some good people, americans all, are not as lucky as you or me. Having enough, does not include all americans, for whatever their situation may be. No hate, not partisan, just fact. To have a cavalier attitude about the effects on so many people's lives is in itself UN42N8.thanks
@realDonaldTrump @PeteHegseth @FoxNews And then shut The govt down because if you don't get what you want. I know people that need that paycheck from a govt job. No #savings,  have #children, #christmas? A tyrant would not understand the repercussions of his actions, the @POTUS should be knowledgeable of the facts
@realDonaldTrump SNL has been an entertaining program for many years. The fact that you need to have an education to understand some of the humor makes it inappropriate for many trump supporters.  The world's  citizens want an inclusive equal society that lifts everyone, not a chosen few.
@realDonaldTrump Complaining has never been a great communication tool.	Putting something or someone down to make yourself look good or better is a tactic we should be taught by our parents and teachers before we are in our teens. Use @POTUS as a teaching event, to better the future of our chldrn
GOP rep.Moran said, asked how much stock he puts in Trump’s latest denial vis-a-vis Cohen. “I don’t have a comment to that question, other than it’s always important for everyone — to the best of their ability — to tell the truth.”	Best of their ability gives wide latitude 2trump
@realDonaldTrump Mulvaney accepts the jobs trump gives him even Though he has said in public that "trump is a terrible person". What causes people to over look personal traits to further political ends?Is this the best we can do as a Nation,winning for a few means many are losing,USA needs better
@realDonaldTrump My sarcasm came out sounding too close to adulation...I have contempt for 99% of the decisions @POTUS makes. This tweet was a FU to no good ideas trump
@RobbieSaysStuff @realDonaldTrump Contempt fueled sarcasm
@realDonaldTrump I hope you never rest in peace...please live long and feel the hatred until your mind completely snaps
@realDonaldTrump So now we should be getting some really great, low cost, super cool insurance as per your campaign promises. With a brain as big as yours it will be really good, and everyone will have low cost medical coverage.What a good guy you are! Thanks for using your head for all americans
@realDonaldTrump Criminal
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS	@HillaryClinton 	Donald Trump wanted media exposure, he wanted the most he could get. Top of Google images, every front page of every (fake!lol) news publication. Boy did he get his wish, be careful what you wish for,like trump,you may get what you deserve
@realDonaldTrump Nope lets let you own it
@realDonaldTrump No shame	No honor	Time for	No more trump administration of wealth to the wealthy, his family, his friends
@realDonaldTrump With all the poor word choices you have used you @POTUS @fakePOTUS should have been fired long ago
@realDonaldTrump It is sad to see a president play only one tone deaf tune. Your brain must be on fire with all the negative possibilities.People that fear the worst justifiably are just paranoid. People that fear the worst because the worst may happen,have reason to fear it.If I was you I'd stfu
@realDonaldTrump Bad people end up badly	You are going to be the biggest badly ender upper on the history of American politics, even many of your supporters will deny they supported you in the future. " who me?, no way I voted for that idiot trump "  the joke is on you Mr biggest brain @POTUS lol
@realDonaldTrump You are a dirty deal maker	Saudi investment money	Russian mobster investment money	Big oil rollback emissions rules money	Hush money for cheating on your wife(wives?)	Lied to America about the best people you'd hire	Belittle people who don't agree in front of uneductd supporters
@realDonaldTrump In Trump memory shutting down the govt never did anything to bother  him.  For some people shutting down the government was pretty bad. There should be priorities in U.S. spending, education, great accessible medical care, to name two. Building a wall to pander to hysterics.Nope
@realDonaldTrump This was the funniest thing all day...	Google search idiot...click images and guess who pops up the most	Our dear old @realDonaldTrump @POTUS #idiot
@realDonaldTrump Trust me the american people care to dislike @POTUS, the citizens of the world care to dislike donald trump, educated people dislike your lying, we'd are waiting so see you leave so we can rebuild the trust and stature of the UNITED STATES of AMERICA
@realDonaldTrump Actually he is like me, anti Trump, anti self serving, anti corruption, anti lack of compassion, anti lawbreakers, anti uneducated leader, anti womanizer, anti liar, anti @realDonaldTrump, anti MLB, anti Putin, anti whatever you believe so stfu
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends As opposed to job performance by @POTUS. Never has one man in such a self serving way done more to damage america.Taking us down dangerous paths because he can't read and learn about where the path ends.China plays forever game, Trump plays 5 minutes in the twitter game. Badtimes
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS "speaks" to America on twitter because he has limited mental organizational skills. In public his rails are not straight enough for the trump mental train to stay on track. Is it any wonder his lies seem like truth to him, poor little fella, over his head in a job for real
@realDonaldTrump Lol, why would someone want to work with a president with your interactive skill set? Over ten must mean -2 in trump speak.
@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs Grasp at any light as you move down the darkening tunnel, any opinion that helps your mental state is great, like an opioid, when the lights go out on your presidency there will be celebrations in the streets, hugging and happiness like at a great wars ending. Smoking good
@realDonaldTrump Geez let it rest and wait for the shoe store to drop. Over and over again you tweet like a sick old bald lifeless unloved caricature of a president. You would be great in a sitcom where everyone laughs and shakes their head at your foolishness. Were it only a sitcom, we'd be ok
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews How cavalier to be able to pay so much for sex outside of marriage.excellent example for all the little MAGArers out there.dont just cheat on your wife but pay the big bucks and it's ok, a simple business transaction. Being such a super great business man makes it understandable
@realDonaldTrump We already know what your idea of great is. Unqualified trump yes person, if they don't work out you use childish invective to disparage them. You had a chance to be at least a good president, now you are a sham pres. History will make your children's children cringe at your mmry
@realDonaldTrump Yes! Great deals with the Saudis money family wise. Upended the status quo where the US was powerful but respected, helpful without being vindictive, a guiding light for other countries to emulate. You and your kind have been the bane of civilizations for thousands of years.stfu
And...He will pardon #manafort on the last day of his taking hostage of our white house, not a day before.  As he leaves, he will not care about political fallout
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends @seanhannity @IngrahamAngle 	Trump does things the only way he knows how,as he ran his businesses on the edge,and to bankruptcy so too he is pushy america along a razors edge.He knows he will walk away someday, what will he leave in his path
@realDonaldTrump Says the guy with the koolaid stand ready to tell all his followers to drink this and it will all get better
@realDonaldTrump We need a publicly administered mental health check, mind of like the apprentice, for president wannabes. This guy is so far of the rails it makes his followers look stable.
@realDonaldTrump This is a lie
@realDonaldTrump About as brave and served well, like general bone spurs did
@realDonaldTrump @GeraldoRivera Saying it over and over doesn't make it true, especially from @POTUS. More like good advertising to keep the possibility of your destruction in the public eye. I follow you as a non-follower, non trump believer. watching you crumble under the weight of a job you weren't made for
@realDonaldTrump Locked up in your own mental jail it seems.Not strong enough to stand up and be judged,you kick and scream like a small child with no parental supervision. Now you will have to be in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons,you love the spotlight,but your mental health will suffer
@realDonaldTrump The only thing that will clear you is removal from office
@realDonaldTrump You are a slanderous little bitch boy tjat has never been noble or loyal or patriotic...pathetic excuse for president and an embarrassment in front of the whole world
@realDonaldTrump We need to have a test for honesty,integrity and honor so that a presidency like this @POTUS will never happen to the American people again. Maybe make all politicians take the test to root out the self serving grifters too.If all you can be in life is rich or a pol disqualified!
@realDonaldTrump New in general is bad for FAKE @realDonaldTrump FAKE @POTUS 	And as an aside, we have celebrated the life of a president that was true to the name,loyal to his country and selfless in his efforts(for the most part).what kind of celebration will we have at donald trump's time?
@realDonaldTrump I love their genuine smiles,	As opposed to genuine scowls... https://t.co/er7hGWgNNq
@realDonaldTrump @EmmanuelMacron An honest man, or leader would want those with information about any misdeeds to be forthright and honorable by speaking truthfully.A dishonest man would say a person has guts for not speaking of known truths. How wearisome it must be to juggle so much dishonor in public.poor you
@realDonaldTrump Schmuck
@BernieSanders We don't feel comfortable.	But politicians inject wording in the discourse that is false, misleading and usually a cover for am agenda built behind doors with lobbyists that absolutely do not have the best interests of all americans in mind
@lynneadams804 @realDonaldTrump Many of the largest construction companies, trucking companies and other legal businesses were built with good old american drug money, by americans selling drugs to americans
@realDonaldTrump I wonder why drug dealers, mob bosses, and other less than stellar individuals are not lining up to file to run for president seeing the example republicans have given supporting someone like trump.Used to be good people aspired to serve there, now crooks and thieves eye that job
@realDonaldTrump Like a trapped rat you spit and snarl with the best of them
@POTUS 	George bush senior was a wonderful man.	@realDonaldTrump not so much.		@POTUS44 is a wonderful man.	Donald Trump not so much.		Richard Nixon was not so nice, like Donald Trump, but maybe trumpster wins that duel.	The duel of the not so nice	not so wonderful presidents.
@realDonaldTrump Please stay away from the podium at George Bush's funeral. It isn't your funeral yet. That is the only one where your world is appropriate
@realDonaldTrump canceled your meeting with putin? you knew you would speak to him anyway, how is he going to give you your orders without the actual intelligence community finding out the details. Of course you will speak privately, another @POTUS lie.I like the way @POTUS44 ranks higher on twtr
@realDonaldTrump Corrupt liar	Full of himself	The biggest reality show in history will be your truth, your lies, your prosecution
@realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS A more bogus two faced dishonest clueless wish has never been writ.	You know tbey are only words and do not come from the heart
@realDonaldTrump It is just business spread around our world,you should know Mr. Make it in america,you make your stuff abroad because of your really huge super power intellect,the rest of us do it because it is good  business and the American people that are not excessively rich appreciate price
@realDonaldTrump Especially all em arr racistly motervated fowks
@realDonaldTrump So says saint trump
@realDonaldTrump Words cannot really begin to describe the mental images of a deranged man. That you attempt to put your thoughts to words is a great example. You seem to drag on the entire world as if we have to steer with a two flat tires.I hate to say my wish is for an @POTUS impeachment quick
@realDonaldTrump Lock you up would be my choice, little man with toxic voice.
@realDonaldTrump As a person deflects honestly acquired blame by pointed at others, he ( @POTUS ) he becomes less of a man and more of a coward.Taking credit for mistakes is the mark of a strong leader,not a symbol of failure,mistakes can be rectified,cowardly attempts to remove blame not so much
@realDonaldTrump @cindyhydesmith Yeah all you white racist,wife beater, beer guzzling,child abusing gun loving great americans vote for my choice so we can make america great.
@realDonaldTrump @USTreasury @stevenmnuchin1 You lie so much why would a journalist ask you about anything but to comment on already known truths. Any fool knows that asking a liar a question where the answers are well defined already is a trap used on, well, fools. The president of the united states should be honest first.
@realDonaldTrump I wish i could sue you for.being a shitty president,lying to the world as if you were the voice of America,being so cruel (and unusual)that you are like a punishment on thinking human beings. Maybe I could take it directly to the 9th circuit court! And win,79% is great odds in LV
@realDonaldTrump Actually justice Roberts cannot say whay he wants or the words he uses to describe your lack of Everything would seem very unfair and mean to you.Everyone in government has to walk on eggshells around you because there has never have been such a vindictive, evil bitch pres before
@realDonaldTrump Afraid to tread where you send brave men and women, but so willing to act tough when no one is close enough to tell you shut the f up. Being tough on twitter is your way to over compensate for being an absolute fraud, not strong, not smart, not good enough, never will be.
@realDonaldTrump from NYTimes 	“The chief justice’s comment punctuates the fact that the administration is doing very poorly before judges appointed by Republicans and Democrats,”Mr. Gerson said,“most of whom are acting, not as politicians in robes, but as independent agents of the rule of law.”
@realDonaldTrump Presidential activism by someone untrained that has the IQ of a slug is the real danger to america. Poor choices by @POTUS create unstable people that act on their inner demons.Supporting murderers,thieves,and people that hold women to a lesser regard,is unacceptable. 	Vry so sad
@realDonaldTrump You you you
@realDonaldTrump Learn about the judiciary system and stop berating something you can't understand, you sound pathetic and always want to make people believe you are always right when obviously no one is always right and a liar is mostly wrong.
@realDonaldTrump @RealDrGina Must be #trumpporn
@realDonaldTrump America is a leader with a helping hand to reach out as needed,not a leader with a stick to be used against anyone &amp; everything for any reason that moves you.	When you are indicted for a crime that you can't buy your way out of, will be vindication for all the heartache u caused
@realDonaldTrump 	@POTUS 	@foxandfriends @seanhannity 	@IngrahamAngle 	#NoTrumpPardon 	He will be impeached!
@realDonaldTrump @mauriciomacri Emails	Collusion 	Financial deals	Trump swamp	@POTUS 	The leader of the pack vroom vroom
@realDonaldTrump America always pays dictators and tyrants to have a foot in their neighbors doors.	We turn a blind eye to atrocities and human rights violations only if it is in America's self interest(or our president's financial interests) squeaky clean hands of America are a myth inkd in gold
@kennixworld @justjenn14 @RepAdamSchiff The first lady should grab him by his pussy and tell him to knock this shit off
@realDonaldTrump You can't buy class so you build a gilded hotel.people don't want you in their country clubs so you build those too, lucky You!	But to be so crass that you act like schoolyard bully ALL THE TIME, is pathetic. No balls with that mushroom? Can't suck it up buttercup?#POTUStantrum
@POTUS wonder why we sent a high level US Gov representative to saudi Arabia to work on what sanctions we should apply(with the saudis!)for killing a journalist hacking up his body and lying about it.	Kind of like a judge deferring to a mafia Don about jail time @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump It must feel nice the clean warmth of hero's making you feel all part of the goodness @POTUS.	Never one for bravery or doing the uncomfortable for others, or even paying contractors full freight must weigh on you. But still, I guess ripping people off feels good to some people.
@realDonaldTrump Reality is difficult to imagine for you in any regard. Un42n8 you are the last to know.
@realDonaldTrump @VP you are the only one that believes a lie is usually better than the truth.	And if you tell it by golly it must be true... #honestAbetrump
@realDonaldTrump @GOPLeader @RepLaMalfa @KenCalvert @fema Yes doing their job well!	Devotion to their communities. Please learn something while you are there @POTUS. Try to think outside your box.
@realDonaldTrump @TomReedCongress Because you believe you can put her down at will. A strong speaker should be able to stand up and call a lying, spiteful, uninformed, self involved, sexist, racist, money grubber what he truly is
@khan80602 @BernieSanders Many people are not able to compete on this extremely unlevel playing field, and our society believes if you cannot compete, to do for yourself, then FU.	I have gotten mine many times over, white, educated, risk taker,boundary pusher,I have compassion for those that cannot,simple
@khan80602 @BernieSanders Getting mine would be -getting enough to everyone
@realDonaldTrump Deflect and abuse the truth all you want, but the American people do not look at our nation's congress as a game. We hire all of you to do a great job, be civil, be inclusive and know that we are watching you. There is no fake news, just news, yours is sometimes epicly bad is all
@realDonaldTrump I finally figured it out, you thought you could buy yourself the label of alpha male, but it takes real courage, humble strength, and it doesn't come from money. @POTUS you sit in a position of power, and yet you are weak willed and lack any personal traits that would help you be
@CNN @BernieSanders Good luck with that, as legislators wpuld get an earful from the only people they ACTUALLY listen to are the rich and powerful
@realDonaldTrump How about some solid health care, honesty in the face of mistakes, thoughtful, important engagement instead of agressive imposition of our values on other nations by force.
@BernieSanders Our system creates inequality, plain and simple. The rich and well connected are rarely privy to the effects of those at the bottom, nor do they really care. That rules are drawn skewed in the favor of the wealthy is no secret, as those in congress simply want to get theirs too
@realDonaldTrump Say it ain't so Mr pres....we know that your words ate usually the opposite of your reality...so now you are saying the white house is screwed, your wife is actually in charge, but at least the greasy, artery clogging cheeseburgers are still being delivered
@realDonaldTrump Did your parents teach you to verbally put down people so you will look good? Or did they just put you down because you were who you are? Trying to elevate yourself by creating distraction is not working. You are still who you are, no matter the smoke and mirrors you manufacture
@realDonaldTrump Most Americans are biased against cruelty, tactless ranting, outright verbal abuse. Your choices are your chains in life, if you can't carry them, don't make them.
@realDonaldTrump Sounds like desperation, like a very big rat trapped in a corner. You talked a good talk to get elected, but your actions and those of your poor choice hires, speak way louder than your words
@MichelleObama Thanks for speaking in a way that Would normally bring everyone together. Today is perilous for truth.
@realDonaldTrump Yes everyone should hire americans whatever it take...except trump properties of course
@Oprah @MichelleObama Does the wonderful first lady have figuratively pinch herslf to make sure this all real? An amazing life nurtured by loving people!
@realDonaldTrump You are so FOS	You care about this about as much as you care for truth
@MichelleObama Great lady full of poise.	All women should be so lucky.
@MarkSanford 	Enjoyed your piece in the @nytimes, insightful and valid in the current political climate.
@realDonaldTrump It is not a battle for you to make. It is an election with american votes at stake. Though rigged against the silent and disenfranchised, a constitution right to be counted no matter what it takes. How presidential you could be if you were honest and not so insecure.	@POTUS
@realDonaldTrump Old man repeating himself doesn't make it better
@realDonaldTrump All in all its just another brick in the wall...
@realDonaldTrump What a maroon
@realDonaldTrump You image yourself trying to make things better by belittling everything you don't agree with. Like the song about fd up teachers putting down kids. Dark sarcasm in the classroom. Hey, Teacher, leave those kids alone.
@realDonaldTrump Have you noticed that only about 1-2% of trump's  followers like his tweets. The rest are mostly like me, entertained by your crass outbursts and childlike tantrums. But in no way supportive of your actions.
@realDonaldTrump Is your mind broken?On one hand you berate a state that is going through a difficult emergency,then you have someone write this for you(any fool can see these are not your words)you look so foolish,seem desperate,so out of your league. You Can't whitewash over your intent w words
@realDonaldTrump Just bully them big D.	Like we did to the Japanese before ww2...
@BernieSanders Every authoritarian person is self made. Here is always a choice. Not being able to process life's steps in a positive way makes some people unstable, uncivil, and many darker uns. Mr Trump is a twisted ego, created by enablers going back to his childhood
@realDonaldTrump You frame everything around a donald trump that is only great in your own mind. Truth and justice is what you will receive, though you may only have signed up for the power. I for one will be glad to know who the @realDonaldTrump  is , when the investigation(s) are completed
@realDonaldTrump At least you have a good shill writer once in a while.	Kind of removes that pestilential air that your Twitter account usually carries.
@realDonaldTrump Screw you and the leaky boat you arrived on
@realDonaldTrump Word is, you're striking a deal for a new Hotel
@realDonaldTrump @EmmanuelMacron Great thumbs up from #Putin , every leader of the free world ( and the majority of the world's population) held back showing a different digit.
@realDonaldTrump I cringe for some reason when he uses the word God
@realDonaldTrump Yes there is a reason.	Atmospheric moisture is declining rapidly, temperatures are averaging upward		These two things produce extreme dryness and and extreme weather patterns of micro regional ocean effect storm events.If you listened(and learned)from our scientists instead of...
@realDonaldTrump Batman needs to lock this joker up
@realDonaldTrump You are lying of course.		If you ever tell the truth for a day the world will probably stop spinning for the collective gasp...
@realDonaldTrump @SenJoniErnst @ChuckGrassley @TerryBranstad As long as he's loyal to you and scuttles all investigations into your sleazy operations.
@realDonaldTrump No friends = no clue	How you've lived is how you govern.
@realDonaldTrump You as president are clueless.	Never having criends or people around you that want something from you, skews your reality.	Nobody likes a bully,but may smile at you and nod when you speak, then call you a moron behind your back.	Wise up, as we say in #Hawaii
@realDonaldTrump @marcorubio T4ump bots
@realDonaldTrump Republicans never hide republican votes
@krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Except when they are lawyers for @realDonaldTrump
@BernieSanders Yes,truly right.	Also,it is amazing that the christian right uses HELL's poster boy to do their dirty work(that would be @realDonaldTrump)all through history morals and values have been put aside to promote one sided agendas.This administration is no better, except to the rich
@realDonaldTrump Law enforcement should focus on your absolutely not the best people you hired for positions in your administration, they are only best at corruption,inside dealing, and blocking you from prosecution. Lying every day doesn't give you a special place in hell,it makes you poster boy
@realDonaldTrump Republican voter suppresion more likely.
@realDonaldTrump Chimp on a leash more like it...
@realDonaldTrump Desperation of powers...	Separation of powers means that the exective branch is checked by aI strong Congress, independent of the president.That the congress is dominated by people that have no voice to balance our presidents whims is shameful. a so-called party is his trumpet
@realDonaldTrump I voted for any democrat due to your toxic discourse. https://t.co/uw7Vd6L4XE
@realDonaldTrump Go to the #voteRALLY	Held in every town in america today, stand with you neighbors, say hello to new people and vote.		This pnly rally that actually has meaning!	#voteRALLY
@realDonaldTrump Your reputation precedes you..		Your white supremacist leanings are abhorrent.		Your unconscionable words and preaching is everything that should not be shown to children.		Vote for anyone that is not republican to take the stick out of this foolish grasping little man.
@realDonaldTrump Blue	Blue blue	By you
@realDonaldTrump I know right?	Like the millions and millions of illegal votes against you that gave the popular vote to the more qualified candidate. And that damn russian leaders vote to help you become @POTUS.Darn illegal votes!		I will vote legally	I will vote against your agenda		I VOTE BLUE
@ObamaFoundation @BarackObama Wow... listening to an enlightened man sure make the differences stark.
@realDonaldTrump If only you were truly departing...		Shame on your administration's choices and actions.		Shame on the republican senators that have put their morals and ideals in storage to suppport you just to stay in power.		Where are the republican heros now?
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews plays you just like you play us.		Bottom line @POTUS	We need a new player!
@realDonaldTrump Only a complete fool thinks this way. No wonder trump supporters cant see right from wrong.@POTUS is responsible 100% for the tone of discourse in america among those least able to process vicious words,thoughts,and deeds.	can't understand what trump went through to be like this
@realDonaldTrump Be a dick-	Vote for his picks!
@realDonaldTrump Blip
@realDonaldTrump Yes yours is bigger!!!	Hopefully your indictment will be bigger than any president in history
@realDonaldTrump @PeteHegseth @KatiePavlich @foxandfriends 3 MORE DAYS		VOTE BLUE FOR ME AND YOU!
The world watches as the USA staggers between prosperity and recklessness. Lead by a man that has never worked for the common good,and has no compassion or interest in learning.That we have a vote matters,that we exercise that vote now may be pne of the most important in history
@realDonaldTrump So self absorbed...	Please absorb some humanity.	Lose the hate 	Lose the anger	Be american in a good way
@BernieSanders Voting against:	Hate	Racisism	Bullying 	Disparagement 	Lying	Self dealing	Inside trading 	Golfing on duty	Division tactics	Un-american values 		These are important	(Maybe not the golfing)	These are who americans are, patriots of humanity, givers, not takers, smart not foolish
@realDonaldTrump Vote for no republicans.	Vote no on hate 	Vote no on bullies	Vote no on name calling politicians	Vote no on @realDonaldTrump's agenda to promote every anti-human rights world leader.	Vote no on self enriching politicians that will do anything to keep their status quo.	Vote blue
Vote for anyone except a republican.	Vote against any trump enabler	@POTUS 	@realDonaldTrump needs a leash and cage. Lets build that cage with one less republican at a time
@realDonaldTrump You have a black heart @POTUS
@realDonaldTrump Vote anything but trump
@realDonaldTrump @HawleyMO Greasy cheeseburger
@realDonaldTrump 	@foxandfriends 	@cnn	@USATODAY 	@washingtonpost 	Vote for good people	It is a secret ballot	Dont kowtow to your spouse, family, boss, friends group think organization.Lie if you have to later with an inner smile if you vote blue in a red house!Voting against him
@realDonaldTrump Your best discussions with tyrants and criminals and poor relations with country leaders that have been in our corner for generations. You beat down people that are humble and lick the boots of people that are bad af
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @CNN @MSNBC @fox 	Is not actual news it is more of a sitcom based on trump and others like him.	@foxandfriends using similar tactics as trump creates an illusion of reality for people that can not process fact from fiction. Then they act on their  unfortunate grasp of manufactured reality
@realDonaldTrump Lol, vote for the staus quo to see a president that has no class have no clue and be himself still...funny stuff you spout as pathetic commander in thief
@realDonaldTrump You and your republican boot lickers have done plenty for the wealthy at the total expense or everyone else. Your mediacal coverage promise was bogus, your economic plans a sham
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews He is still a corrupt man, that talks like an adolf hitler acts like a saudi prince and believes himself above the laws of our country if it suits him. Doesn't drink or smoke but those are the only vices he does not have.
@realDonaldTrump You are like an old time carnival barker,you will say anything to get people in the tent, in this case trying to promote republicans as people that care about the 99 percent instead of being 1 percenters.History up to an hour ago proves your statement false. Med service for all!
@realDonaldTrump @MikeDeWine Doppelganger
RT @BarackObama: Your vote can decide the health care of millions. Your voice can determine the character of our country. You have power —…
@realDonaldTrump Sure more cheap money for rich people to drag our economy into decline hoarding the blood sweat and tears of a truly great nation of people run by thieves and conmen.
@realDonaldTrump And presidential confidence has never been lower since the american nation was decreed.
@realDonaldTrump @cathymcmorris Luckily i dont vote for people you like, i vote blue, mostly against you and your angry hatefilled rhetoric
@realDonaldTrump @Erik_Paulsen @Jason2CD @JimHagedornMN @PeteStauber You must be one insecure puppy to have to spout this stuff over and over to make yourself think you will look good. Fake words of fake praise coming from the mouth of a fake president. Lost by what 3,000,000+ votes. That is not a majority bucko
@elonmusk You'll never be the nothing of Tesla...	Using your wealth to help create a future is something everyone that could, should do. You will have an interesting place in history.
@realDonaldTrump As opposed to the less than stellar job you do. Nut at least your golf hobby is booming.
@realDonaldTrump There are lists and lists of your disparaging remarks and tough guy statements.	In the end history will make it clear to even a dense fool like you where the negativity blossomed in the current age. Be nice is something you never learned, be humble, something you will never know
@BernieSanders @BLeeForCongress Speaking of fighting back,can't @POTUS just sign a decree to remove firearms from any individual that has written hateful or threatening words on social media,i know it would be mostly his supporters but it would be a start,hate-filled individuals should not have the right 2 arms
@realDonaldTrump Do something about with your mighty pen.remove firearms from any individual that has written hateful remarks on social media about any group religion or choice. Simple process, paper and pen and a real @POTUS
An algorithm with #facebook	#twtter	#google	Would pave the way
@realDonaldTrump the best way to prevent domestic terrorism is to remove firearms from ANY individual that promotes hate on social media against any group religion race or choice. @POTUS could do this with a pen, but mostly it would be his base that is disarmed, not a bad idea!
@realDonaldTrump @JudgeJeanine Yes you are a great catalyst for fermenting violent thoughts in otherwise simple marginalized individuals. Great for police business, more military guns, armored vehicles, maybe some hand grenades this time. The military and police industrial complex loves our idiot president.
@realDonaldTrump But can you cry for separated mothers and children	Can you cry for children starving because you support tyrants	Can you imagine someone starving to death while you eat anything you want	Do you know that today there are starving children in america		Would you speak if you did
@realDonaldTrump You should know, think you might get shellacked in the midterms. You presidential maroon
@BernieSanders Unfortunately, leaders that cannot hold in, or silence their inner personal predjudice within public discourse often times influence those with the least capacity to fully process the words used in anywhere near a positive light. Hateful words and distructive demeanor = bad acts
@realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews Can you imagine if it was a democrat sending bombs to trump jockstraps, i mean supporters of the @POTUS ? He would howl like a stuck pig that he is.
@realDonaldTrump Even an idiot knows not to shit in his own backyard. Your supporters are not even that smart.
@realDonaldTrump Putting people down may make you feel better about yourself but usually it is caused by an inner self hate. You are actually insulting yourself by believing you are any different from the words you use. People are mostly aware of the traits they are intimate with. You are them.
@realDonaldTrump Have you ever worshipped god or were you a god fearing man at any time in your life @POTUS? Time amd again your history shows a lack of regard for anything moral, anything fair and just. You make your own rules against god and man in your image. You are a taker 100%, never giving
@realDonaldTrump Wish those were your words.	You have not possibility of thinking like that
@realDonaldTrump Our guns and bombs used to create this image and these words. If god was watching donald trump would not be president. https://t.co/OTBeFA50nR
@realDonaldTrump Rich and well connected powerful people have no clue as to the injusrice within the application of law. Any normal person would have been fired and embarrassed by actions associated with trump. We all lose when the system is gamed by greedy fools with basic criminal intent.@POTUS
@realDonaldTrump I am amazed that even you could try to shield the truth with inuendo ...bomb stuff? Really?	If they were sent you and your family you would be creaming feom the whitehouse about it in great detail,  but since it is the "other side" recieving the bombs,you have not made a gd point
@realDonaldTrump Vote for Great people on election day...	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	..	.	.	.	...	.	.	.	.	Impeach the Bad one!
@realDonaldTrump @BrucePoliquin YES vote for Great people	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.impeach the bad one
@realDonaldTrump @MikeDunleavyGov Vote for good people.	Impeach the bad one.
@realDonaldTrump if we make NDAs against the law when they pertain to any sexual, physical, or mental abuse...that might get the rich and powerful people's attention...nothing else will prevent self-entitlement believing men or women to knock this stuff off. Protections first!
@realDonaldTrump Idiot trump! heroin is so cheap now that people starting on opiod based prescriptions are dying of overdoses.	That is your solution to get people off pills?
@realDonaldTrump The truth always comes out in the end...
@realDonaldTrump You are a rabble rouser making it hard for those lacking moral direction to make good choices. Your words are loud and clear to those that can least process them.	What a poor excuse for a leader you are.
@realDonaldTrump You flip flop like a fish and slimey to boot!
@realDonaldTrump As a cheerleader...you are an ugly s.o.b.
@realDonaldTrump Idiot president
@realDonaldTrump It is lucky you dont know any poor people,or anyone struggling to get the medical care they need,luckily your family wants for nothing, except more of course. You may be the biggest threat to civilization since the black plague and you dont even know you are already toxic.@POTUS
@realDonaldTrump understand the freedoms we enjoy,freedoms that extend to everyone not just one group or group-think crowd, then you understand that voting is more important than many other things you can do for your country(not all things obviously) please vote whether like minded or not.	Vblue!
@realDonaldTrump Facebook will be removing liars and con-people...	But they cant remove words  from the liar in chief and all the people that front for him.
@realDonaldTrump Would be nice if you were required to read each response to your tweets.	On one side would be people telling you how great you are. On the other telling you bits of reality.	I think you are an idiot prince, others think you walk on water. Go figure
@realDonaldTrump The caravans are a testament to your supporting criminals and butchers as heads of state.A testament of failed U.S. policies that help create drug cartels that pray on those that cannot defend themselves.That you would frame the world's misadventures in political terms shows much
@realDonaldTrump kudos given to oneself constantly demonstrate insecurities and personal fears of inadequacy. @POTUS makes up for a lack of inner courage,inner strength,by invoking untrue personal labels ignoring reality's gaze. To live like that it must be so un42n8,to have the world's eyes on u
@realDonaldTrump You dont care how much you lie	Or if putin murders opponents	Or if saudi arabia killed a journalist	Or if a politician hits anyone 	As long as they do what you want it is fine	Luckily you are an old man that can only do damage for a while longer.	You are weak willed and afraid.
@realDonaldTrump Saudis using a @realDonaldTrump ploy	Lying about a journalist leaving an embassy and then making up a story when that doesn't work.Trump has emboldened all mamners of low life to lie cheat and steal from to and about the USA.His cabinet full of money grubbers should be overthrown
@A_a_sulami @realDonaldTrump You people only have morals for other people. Not the ruling class. 	I can list the unacceptable behavior done in private because they are rich enough to make dark choices.	Fuck you comes to mind.
@realDonaldTrump Lies will never be an accepted part of politics after you leave office...your name will be a slang term for dishonor and lying. 	ie:	Stop trumping.	Your trumping out your ass.	So and so is trumping about you. 	Trumping politicians.	He trumped even after he got busted red handed.
@realDonaldTrump Your perspective is that of a man that lives in a glass tower looking down on everyone in your mind.	Contempt for anything that gets in your way seems to be the only mode you have. Compassion? Compromise? Generous? Honorable? Aware? Moral? All these terms are opposite your ideals
@realDonaldTrump How many lies can a preaident tell?	When you are out of office with a Guinness Book or records award we will know the score
@realDonaldTrump Criminals thieves and bullies seem to be your priority...
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews She knows nothing about you, a total conman.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews You are a no class bully through and through. That you believe your actions are ok speaks volumes about who you are. The real donald trump.
@realDonaldTrump Did you bring enough paper towels and hats?
@realDonaldTrump I've been waiting for a totally @POTUS tweet about amazing you were on 60 minutes,super great and all that.Just a heads though, in the future, all these clips will be held up to the light of truth, the speeches,rallies, and more moments of time. As all things are
@FreedomofPress @uspresstracker I love my job now, 	but would enjoy working with them for the greater good
@Snowden You got it right. Powerful people throughout history have both used and created religion for purposes not printed on the label. Today it is one thing,tomorrow something else. That religion mirrors the inner problems of society should be no surprise. All men are created equal xcpt
@realDonaldTrump All we need now is a correction in the #whitehouse...no you would be a good you.
@realDonaldTrump Idiots and thieves in your admin are running the USA
@realDonaldTrump Again self promotion...	Even your children don't tweet all your great(in trump's mind) moments
@realDonaldTrump @LesleyRStahl @60Minutes @CBSNews This should be good	@POTUS on a channel other than @FOXTV ...tomorrow's news will be all about trump's self promotion again, as it has been his entire life. No one else would promote him due to his absolutely distasteful demeanor, except his daddy...
@realDonaldTrump You were a joke on tv	And now a joke on tv	Rallies are for small minded evil men	Hitler,Mussolini,and now Trump
@realDonaldTrump Just out of curiosity @potus were you ever in your whole life a god fearing or even a mildly religious man?From my research you have been the exact opposite. You have flaunted rules, dealt with mobsters,stiffed business partners and suppliers, stiffed other women instead of wives
@realDonaldTrump Would you say #JesusChrist #jesuswould endorse you @realDonaldTrump? Maybe #Mohammed would as he was of the death to the infidels ilk. Your moral compass is as crazy as a @fox
Technology exists to disrupt operation of the space telescopes and other orbiting satellites,  it is possible that satellite technology in orbit that belongs to #china is the culprit. Passive agressive payback for @realDonaldTrump's economic choices. Also a test for future action
@moq_r7 @realDonaldTrump @RT_Erdogan False news from saudi arabia would be in their best interest.  when a journalist speaks truth about the kingdom, the kingdom only knows revenge, like schoolyard bullies called out by witnesses to their acts.
@realDonaldTrump @RT_Erdogan Time to step up and confront the death of a journalist in the embassy in turkey. If it was one of your @foxandfriends @FoxNews @FoxBusiness or other pandering journalist you would do something a bit more upright and firm...instead we have weak @potus wishy washy statements
@realDonaldTrump can you see	By the dawns early light	Who we proudly don't support in all his rantings and ravings because he is a president voted in by a minority of americans.@realDonaldTrump hopefully one day there will be a monument to remind all future generations how absolutely fdup u were
@realDonaldTrump All your #1percent supporters in the arms and military industries are so happy to have a lacky like you.Sure,saudi arabia kills people on orders from leadership but let's sell them our stuff.Sure russia kills people from orders out of the kremlin(putin as mob boss)wtf hug him too
@realDonaldTrump The only people that want ivanka as ambassador are adolescent boys and horny old men. The thinking caring society only rolls their eyes at your suggestion.
@realDonaldTrump You sir...seem to be the smartest idiot I have ever heard. Nothing for everyone, from your mouth, and everything for some people. All through history there are lessons of societies and leaders having failed doing similar, and yet, you are blind, deaf, and lol...dumb.
Vote against a continued perversion of american ideals,vote against each person that fails to stand for all americans not just the rich and well connected,investigate all congress members that pander to economic special interests and gain financially from their actions,get em out
@realDonaldTrump shows your true depth when given exacting evidence about torture and murdering a journalist in Saudi embassy that you would choose business ties over human rights.Saudi Arabia(and russia)are run like mafias and you cant see the harm they promote w/ no moral guide
@realDonaldTrump What kind of person thinks rallies are a good thing, and reading documents in order to govern effectively is a bad thing?	Our president is like a spoiled child that doesn't even have to wipe his own ass.Cant wait for your departure from the national discourse. You will be history
@BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump the #1percent and powers that be would feel foolish to support basic rights for americans like higher education and medical coverage.Though rightfully deserved by all it would begin to narrow the gap between rich and poor and there is no way thay can be supported
@realDonaldTrump God bless the USA	again and remove 	@realDonaldTrump from anywhere near a decision making space.
@FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump You must be having so much fun out traveling without your husband...parting makes all the difference in your world
@realDonaldTrump Heading back to the good old days where the good old boys ruled america by being boys...without fear of consequences, without moral high ground to stand on,  just good old boy collusion in all aspects of government, by and for only their people, only their rich filled ideals.
@bettyboopsy58 @krassenstein @VickieBluewave @realDonaldTrump That is very well put.		Additionally there are so many areas in american society where being "equal" is pure lip service to make one class of people feel good. Or should I say 1 percent of the people feel good.
@realDonaldTrump Love not coffefi
@realDonaldTrump I kove seeing your wife in africa with the same type people you excluded from your properties by racial profiling...she smiles biggest when she is away from your insincere personailty. Happiness is being away from donald trump. America will get to the same happy place in time.
@realDonaldTrump Two liars-	MAYBE BOTH CHEAT ON TAXES BY BEING SUPER SMART 	trump and kavanaugh	#TrumpPressConference 	#ImpeachKavanaugh 	# how many more will @realDonaldTrump invite to his party?
If @POTUS is a liar (lol -if!)	And america continues to let him, then it would only seem fair that he should get to invite someone that lies to the supreme court. Really fair! Maybe #kavanaugh shouldn't release his tax returns either (wink wink) cause, you know, trump won't do it
@realDonaldTrump @PeteSessions Does he cheat on taxes too?
@DHSgov @realDonaldTrump @FCC Resist and turn off your phone duringthe time of the presidential text, anything from the current @POTUS is definitely not presidential.	And a big shout out to @realDonaldTrump and his minions "fuck you all"
So now we know why @realDonaldTrump won't release his tax returns. His history of questionable personal tax liability reduction handed down from his father probably has not changed.  @FoxNews and	@foxandfriends 	Won't report the @nytimes piece but wait for @POTUS to cry fake news
@realDonaldTrump Nothing is constant but change. The good stays. The bad eventually goes. You believe you are good, most of everyone on the planet thinks you are bad. Change will come again. The masses will be important again. Rich people can be rich, but not at the expense of everyone else.
@realDonaldTrump Imagine wjat he will re ad in the history books, not the respectful insights of all the other presidents but drama and scandals
@Comey I imagine the frustration with an administration debasing an institution that has stood for factual investigations in difficult times past.I applaud your continued support @Comey, of the F.B.I., in these troubled moments of our shared history.Service to country is a true calling.
@realDonaldTrump You need to read the history books to understand how things have changed, americans are not about parties, repub dem booze or others. Americans are about freedom without hate, competitive team spirit without malice,  compassion and hope when things get tough, and our history.
@realDonaldTrump I believe it is appropriate to fully investigate the president of the United States, his business, his racial profiling, his abuse of women, and his passive aggressive never being able to look someone in the eye and disagree or debate, ball-less persona
@realDonaldTrump Cant wait until you dont have a reason to have rallies,  what will you do then?	Have rallies anyway because you can?	You are a mean spirited, cold hearted, small intellect, mushroomed headed fool, just my opinion. What a great country that i can say that about the @POTUS schmuck
@JohnBrennan If everything was fair we would not have this particular fiasco.Leaders follow the money and the money never ends up doing all good. To have one group dominate all levels of gov, will never be a recipe for good over bad, right over wrong,justice for those least able to afford it.
@realDonaldTrump Lol
If the american bar association is asking for a kavanaugh investigation, then you know something smells bad,it may not be bad, but probably not good enough to sell until fully examined and tested for bacteria or viral infestations. System may be screwed up but investigate nt vote
@GOP shill #RachelMitchell  misspoke to repub senators saying she would not bring the issue before a court.If she was true to her job she would have interviewed and reviewed all allegations/witnessing parties. As a prosecutor she failed to act in good faith to learn the truth
@realDonaldTrump Sorry for the typo...
@realDonaldTrump #BrettKavanaugh brett kavanaugh	And donald trump @realDonaldTrump	Do not have the balls,as most men who have done similar things to disrespect and abuse women,to admit and be honest as the accusations are heinous and luckily it wasn't there daughter subjected to alcoholic assault
How many teenage boys would habe the balls to admit guilt? How many of the 10s of thousands of adult males that have done similar on the last 50 years would admit guilt now?	Brett kavanaugh? I think not, though he knows the truth.
And due to the sheer horror of having to tell people the facts...how many women keep it inside?
And lets say the female came forward and gave a factual account of the circumstances including drinking and the trust that conpanoons would be protective...how many males would admit theor actions were wrong?...
Just for arguments sake lets assume there were only 10,000 sexual assaults while under the influence of alcohol by high school males...		@POTUS @FoxNews @foxandfriends
@realDonaldTrump You are mostly an asshole, thats what we would call you down here in the cheap seats	You can't understand that normal people see through bluster and self promotion	That the news is about your reality and not your self sighted fantasy 	amazes you due to your in infantile self view
@realDonaldTrump Put trump in place of avenetti and have someone read it to you SFB
@realDonaldTrump Geez	You are speaking to th guy in the mirror and dont even know it.
@realDonaldTrump It sounds like you are even tired of rehashing the same words every time you twit. (Lol-"you twit")	Your words make you look like a tired old man woth nothing important to say.
@realDonaldTrump It must have been a democratic effort to get everyone at the U.N. to laugh at you of course, I mean you are the greatest president since, oh I don't know, that great President before you Barack Obama. I for one am glad the spontaneous laughter at a buffoon's ego trip was honest.
@TraceyWitt64 @realDonaldTrump Well put on all counts
@realDonaldTrump Go home	Any one	Get out of our House!

@realDonaldTrump Laughing at the U.S. president by foreign dignitaries was an interesting sight. A new low and indicative of the direction this administration is moving on the world stage.
@ZorrillaTierna @realDonaldTrump Presidents too it seems...
@realDonaldTrump Rush Limbaugh is in the same club as @POTUS and kavanaugh. The high school boys club. Where denials of following animal instinct over thoughful treatment of women is ok. This type of person can never be a good leader as their self-centered nature prevents altruism on any level
@realDonaldTrump @marthamaccallum @FoxNews Benefit of the doubt gave you an opportunity to get the best and brightest people working for the American public. It seems that you are more inclined to hire those in your own moral image. Morals are a lifetime achievement, not something you can acquire late in life.
@realDonaldTrump We are totally not having to remember the midterms...we count the days and wait for the outcome
@realDonaldTrump Actuallybthey are similar to accusations that you have been dancing around clumsily	...you are no Fred Astaire
@realDonaldTrump Reject trump
@realDonaldTrump Taking away from those at the socio-economic base by not supporting medicare, social security, basic healthcare for every American is why life sucks for people that only feed clothe and house themselves and nothing more. Blaming people for society's lack of advancement is wrong.
@realDonaldTrump Look at the 1percenters that control the flow of legal and illegal drugs to Americans. There has never been a concern for life over profit. Many large companies were built from proceeds of illegal drugs. Nothing will change until new paths of opportunity and support are created.
@realDonaldTrump love to turn off the trump show on the global stage,and would if it was just entertainment.That an uninformed,non-intellectual holds the world's attention in a negative way is unacceptable.Change is always necessary,but our standing is now dirty af due to one man's ego,self image
Americans, each and every one, own the national debt, it has propped up our economy, stock market, and the continually rich. A national debt per capita greater than some could earn in a lifetime. some people are not able to compete in our society, they should also be lifted up .
There's that typo again....
@POTUS	@foxandfriends 	@seanhannity 	@realDonaldTrump 	The USA as a whole,deserves credit for the continued upward spiral of economic advancement.not one person, not one party, but everyone.umfortunate that advancement means taking from those least vested in person wealth. Think!
@realDonaldTrump Great words from 	Draft dodger in chief 	GENERAL BONE SPURS!
@realDonaldTrump All you have to do is look at what has happened in congress before during #clinton probe and previous supreme court vetting over a women's statement regarding impropriety. I always wondered if senaters went back to their office to masturbate afterwards, probably some did
@realDonaldTrump If you were even mildly aware and remotely compassionate you would understand that in those days women as well as men wanted to party and have a good time but reporting sexual assault was tricky. The women ALWAYs looked worse after reporting, within our male dominated system.
@realDonaldTrump You are working for yourself and the russian government. What a stooge you are. Your families name will turn to shit in the history books.
@realDonaldTrump I can lookbat your face while speaking and know only parts are truthful though you taught yourself to believe everything you say, your tells are obvious now.
@realDonaldTrump Your supreme court pick is flawed.	Someone on the highest court should not have the early moral flaws of judge Kavanaugh.That you will be blinded by your own moral failings and continue support is a given. You have changed the swamp into a vile putrid soup, #trumpsoup if You will
@realDonaldTrump You are acting like a #pussybully....you feel you can hit them (china)with tarrifs but cry at the effects when they hit you back
@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/xU8F8bB2EQ
@realDonaldTrump RE: Upcoming Presidential nationwide cell phone allert! I for one will have my phone turned off at that time as the last thing I want is a direct text from #dontmessagemePOTUS. In hawaii we habe a better system - coconut wireless ( although there was a glitch once,"incoming!")
@realDonaldTrump I wish all americans could look on their new found wealth. As usual people at the top have no clue as to the injustice within the application of financial rules that effect Citizens of lesser means.
@realDonaldTrump Mueller will unearth your illegal busoness deals prior to election. You know, the ones in russia? And panama, and new york, and atlantic city.Also, remember those payoffs to the mob through your attorneys so construction could be smooth, its the way you've always done it,not good
@realDonaldTrump Wow, to be so focused on slights that you cannot preside over the citizens of all these great United States. That you golf more than any president in history while on the job is freaky too. If you had just been quiet and let Mueller follow through. Your previous lies muddy all.
@BillClinton I enjoyed your time as president because you acted presidential and didn't act like a cowboy. It is a tough job and not everyone elected can do it
In a perfect world our leaders would be aligned with moderation and good will, that our well being is not the foremost motivation of government is all the more reason to resist those whose eyes are blinded to the lives of all americans,all people of our world. https://t.co/cjpuzKwSAB
@tedcruz  is right people on the left that stand for inclusion and liberty are angry, repulicans control all levers of government but their mean spirited legislation is also a cause. Not to mention all the angry low IQ people called trump supporters, evil evengelicals w blindness
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Yes, we kind of do believe them.	Trump is sick af
@realDonaldTrump I understand the paper towels you will be throwing to the fine americans down south have your name and @MAGA logos on alternating 	sheets, great promotional items @POTUS !
@realDonaldTrump And what is your thinking, 	About #manafort flipping?	@POTUS ?
@realDonaldTrump Sometimes the better part of valor is let it go.	Sometimes. 	A person has to know when to fight and when to be silent.	You are beginning to sound like the guy in our town that has mental issues and stands on the street yelling at the world, we see him but can't hear him anymore
@kayleighmcenany @RealDrGina @realDonaldTrump He likes this book because she looks like #stormydaniels he only sees the pictures	And doubt if he will read the words
@realDonaldTrump How's #Manafort now big guy?	You have a new name for him too?	You used alot of the good ones already, lol.	Maybe pardonM, or something like that, we know you think it is so unfair  to go after prosecute and prove wrong doing by such a good guy. All your acquaintances are so good!
@BarackObama Great things can happen when good people focus
@realDonaldTrump There should be work requirements for rich people, maybe 10 hours community service for each million dollars they pull out of the sytem...sounds good to me, don't want to continue doing community service? Stop when you have enough and dont be greedy
@realDonaldTrump And I meant that with the utmost due respect
@realDonaldTrump Fuck you
@realDonaldTrump Most people, really everybody is smarter than you give them credit for. You on the other hand seem a bit mentally unstable, really stand out in that area, even in a crowd of unstable people. Counting the days till you are, in your favorite words- #lockedthefup
@realDonaldTrump Just like you deny and push back against women that accuse you of improprieties or you may look weak, the American public must continue to push back at your nonsense because even you know that AMERICANS are not weak!
@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs The american people are lucky that your hiring skills only point at your lack of honor and loyalty.That you have hired people that work on the inside to thwart some of your moves is highly ironic.Cant wait for your real @realDonaldTrump book or better still an actual honest movie
@realDonaldTrump Just think of and prepare a list of all the cities with unmet infrastructure needs, you will be able to blame them all in case this hurricane smacks people down. I don't mean the good white rich republicans of course mr #stupidtrump
@realDonaldTrump You should hope and pray that your fema does an excellent job to male everyone whole after this or it may be a final injury to your maniacal agenda.	We'll call it the fake hurricane response.
@realDonaldTrump I love that you are in charge and doing everything you can to own a "red wave"...lol af. You couldn't be happier...lol, me too! And I can't stand your actions. I am helping anyone register that i can to f you over at the polls.
@realDonaldTrump You words are like a microscope of your soul...
@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs Man, you are like a spoiled child crying wolf, how's that working for you @realDonaldTrump? #stupidtrump
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Pence stays silent while you lie and divide, he deserves to leave on the trump train too
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews After it hits it will be Trump's hurricane. If his organization skills and personnel decisions are any clue to what is in store, we are in for a rough hurricane hit
@realDonaldTrump Yes, we know what constitutes great peope in your eyes. Is it any wonder?
Pence said he will pardon @realDonaldTrump upon any criminal conviction after impeachment?
@realDonaldTrump Read some of the paper generated not the comic book character cheat sheets your staff generate for you...if it has pictures on it, it is not accurate.
@realDonaldTrump @SavannahGuthrie @TODAYshow Liars are easy to spot once they are known, most of your words can't be helped with salt. "You will be a great president now that you have given up lying once and for all" nope doesn't work for me(lying)
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Retweet russian propaganda all you want but there is only one truth.
@realDonaldTrump Look around your house and you can see the sources more numerous than you can count, fooling yourself is like being your own lawyer.
@realDonaldTrump They (your staff) feed you the smooth running line so you don't go off in a tantrum and spew more garbage...we can imagine what they say behind your back, the dame thing most americans say/think, is this bitch for real? Go #plaidshirtguy !
@realDonaldTrump Reading and writing is a prerequisite to being an author...you will only be able to tell your story to someone with those qualifications. It will be fiction of course, just like the fact that you won the election fairly...most of your base don't buy books anyway. Mr Un-president
RT @BernieSanders: Richard Sackler helped cause the opioid crisis through aggressive marketing and lobbying of the opioid painkiller OxyCon…
@SpaceX @elonmusk Thanks for executing an exciting vision, especially from a private citizen, it is wonderfilled and a good example for the children.  The weight off all you try to accomplish is awe inspiring. Acquiring vast amounts of money is meaningless without trying to better all lives
@michellesdaly @kscool_ The current technologies within a new patrol car can read your speed in any direction coming or going in any direction relative to said patrol car, evm if patrol car is moving.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Embarrassing!
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Proof reading would help my thoughts become clearer in type, bit my emptions and knowledge of actual as opposed to alternative facts blind my #reply thumb...lol
@realDonaldTrump Wow @realDonaldTrump I aplaud your words anx support for religious freedom, I myself do not subscribe to any organized religion so I know I am not am not included in those freedoms yoh support. Though in truth I would bet money you @POTUS did not write this nor read every word...
@realDonaldTrump Repeat rehash repeat rehash.	Can you imagine your legacy when your house of cards collapses. When people realize medical coverage for citizens should be a right and not a product. When more people are hurt by protectionism.	When america cannot declare bankruptcy like you do.
@realDonaldTrump If only things were that simple. The same reason you make your hats and products overseas to make a better deal,only you want to pick and choose who should benefit. People named trump=ok to outsource abroad,everybody else=not so much. Your agenda will backfire poorly on USA
@realDonaldTrump American dream does not include creating fear in citizens by division and slander. You should not teach children anger and viciousness towards other people just for ploitical theatre. We need leaders that can use thoughful expression of ideas and not wave sticks or throw stones
@realDonaldTrump Still making  trump products outside of the country? How about paying americans  more so they will want to work at your golf courses and country clubs. is it only you and the rich that should profit from using other countries workers. What about low prices for us citizens
@realDonaldTrump Great example of someone that can own a mistake and apologize @POTUS 	People who say things that are not right must be strong enough to do the right thing. It is quite a contrast to your style of pretending to know the truth, creating falsehoods, and outright labeling slurs as ok
@realDonaldTrump The World is watching you go crazy with fear if being impeached.	The world is watching and laughing that your own people work against you and talk about you as if you were a nobody using words of contempt.	The world is watching republicans just waiting to throw you under the bus.
@realDonaldTrump @DiamondandSilk You are such a brown nose attractor Mr. @POTUS
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes If everyone in a group is losing respect then it is not a good thing that the most disrespected disrespecful individual is their most popular  member.And for further clarity, only the people benefiting from the republicans are the ones attending a party,on taxpayer's  dime
@TLinfesty a world where words can mean different things to different people I was glad to see a bit of reality at @realDonaldTrump's shoulder.I do not know many people that support him because I live in the last state of social tolerance #Hawaii where racism is not ok,and helping people is
@realDonaldTrump Make your cheesy hats in america hypocrite
@realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump will you own the next recession that may happen on your watch. Will @FoxNews believe you created your own mess...who will you blame, how will you defend your choices. You have no appreciable education for the decisions u make, only the advice of money grubbers
@realDonaldTrump I like the term symptom with your name attached. Like a deadly virus symptom,we are getting trumps.quite a good discription of what you represent and what the republican party is keeping quiet about to maintain control at any cost. Like a really runny std or flesh eating bacteria
@ericbolling @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Has anyone told you that using your own mind instead of following a pied piper like trump would be the better route for an educated individual?	Facts do not support your/his arguments
@realDonaldTrump Sing like a canary why don't you. Lets see your tax returns you lying cheating mentally challenged idiot
@JoeBiden @BarackObama Great speech for a great president
Great speech greater man. https://t.co/R6emGFEafN

@realDonaldTrump What good will paper on your desk do you, if a logical patriot hides it and your memory is not good enough to ask for it? The joke is on you little man. you are the joke.
@realDonaldTrump @CNN Phone text errors suck
@realDonaldTrump Mayne you shouldnt watch obama on @CNN . it would show how a real leader speaks and you would just hate it.
Impeach trump and pence.	#Trump #Pence	Any leader not trying to raise all americans to a higher standard, not just the rich or specific party affiliated should not have a citizen's  job as leader. Silence in the forefront of todays negative discourse is unacceptable #GreatUSA
A respected man, @POTUS44 hopefully not the last president that actially wants to do the job to the best of his ability,with his ability matching the nation's ideals without malice or self centered motivations.A wonderful example to children and true leader of The free world. https://t.co/WzQ3rZJw8k
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS There goes my spellcheck oath
@realDonaldTrump For @realDonaldTrump realDnot to own the words he uses,slurs,profanity,racist,gender based whatever,shows that he is not as strong a character as he believes himself to be. Retard,dumb soutjerner and other terms would be believable coming from our @POTUS  because of his macho act
@realDonaldTrump You are acting like a third rate religious leader preaching doom and gloom if your way is not followed.America will be bere long after we've found out the truths about you that are hidden behind your false confidence/childish defensiveness.	Your way or america will what?
@realDonaldTrump You are dangerous,disingenuous,and probably smell bad. Lol	There is so much about you that is repulsive!	We gotten ditch the trump cruelty from the national discourse 	#whenweallvote
@realDonaldTrump If what you said was important/true we would be watching uou on the news or reading about you across the country.since you have to have rallies to put your views across without the questions asked of a real @POTUS you are only preaching to your own choir.Stay on the rally trail
@realDonaldTrump Stay on your glory tour so you cant do harm in office...nore rallies please!
@realDonaldTrump With your vindictiveness it would be impossible to relay that information.	The person doing tje op-ed is a patriot,someone that sees and understands your total lack of a grasp of the reality that is your office.More people should disclose your problems,private reactions and such

@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/YDWhPZnmGj
@realDonaldTrump I can see why you want to do rallies all the time.white house staff that you hired have no respect as your actions do not warrant it.Congressional republicans don't respect you but politically motovate themselves to lie about it, your V.P. is just waiting for your job to open...
@realDonaldTrump @MariaBartiromo It is wave carefully managed by A real President named Barack Obama. If you jad been handed a financial mess it would stay a mess just as you have no clue how to remove the USA from Iraq, Afganistan Syria and other countrys we are playing #LiveMilitaryChess in.	Money isnt the #it

@realDonaldTrump His agenda is rich people oriented.	His financial advisers are greedy and anti populists. His choices harm,denigrate,and marginalize american citizens. He panders to organizations that promote division and discord.If ever there was a true anti-president @realDonaldTrump is that 1
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Idiot @realDonaldTrump words from a adolescent intellect

@realDonaldTrump This is your vindictive gut speaking. 	This is your schoolyard bested bully speaking.	This is how a man betrayed by his wife would speak.	These are your nightmares coming to life.	In a while you will be a tragic historical footnote that most people will swear they voted against
@realDonaldTrump You can call me stupid for misspelling text, but please dont insult me saying i support our president
@realDonaldTrump Guaranteed the unloyal official exists,  just as you are hyper disloyal, so have you trained others to act in your manner, with your lack of regard,  ypu jave earned no real respect even from your own staff...	A presidential wannabe tjat will go down in history as a fool,liar,sot

@realDonaldTrump @nytimes reports faithfully about an unsavory character in the #WhiteHouse, it is unfotunate but inevitable that your truths come out, though of course not from your own mouth or @WHPressSec 's mouth...you have no shame, which is interesting to watch
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse For a dishonorable @POTUS you sure heap alot of honors on yourself.guaranteed no universities will bestow honors on you.But i do understand #Putin is ready to bestow medals and cash on you for your service to mother Russia and the future USSR
@realDonaldTrump You were elected because russia has you in their pocket and used its considerable energy to sway people of low intellect and moral fiber, i.e. your base.that you are a pied piper is true,that you speak truth is laughable, that the truth will not set you free is a given, poor man.

@realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews Just wave your little hands and the unfortunates will believe you above all others, I pity those among your followers that have to watch you lose,just like a lousy sports team. Most will not have the mental fortitude to process your decline,many will in time deny they supported U
@realDonaldTrump Poor little man donald, up to his butt in the makings of the largest shit storm in political history. This is #presidentialapprentice , better than fiction, jokes about trump will told for a hundred years. You're almost fired, but you are truly fried!
@realDonaldTrump You rail against everything you are.	You @realDonaldTrump are the embodiment of every argument you smear. You are the divider in chief, un principled and unique in politics,burst with anger at every perceived slight, and can't see what's in the mirror when you stare right at it.
@realDonaldTrump @PressSec Trump wrote this in his usual prose for her to read.
@realDonaldTrump @PressSec Dream on you and your unimaginative lackey. The prestige of the jobs within the whitehouse has been diminished beyond measure, when trump falls all these brown nosed individuals will not be able to wash away the @realDonaldTrump stain.	Preach your lies but truth always prevails.
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump A train filled with bullshit is only another train filled with bullshit.	A trump train is an overloaded bullshit express.
@realDonaldTrump I wonder if he can sue you for slander and subpoena the gentleman you mention. 	You lie of course. But better still, you are too foolish to stop. What a wonder you are not in jail from past excesses. Your time will come?
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS 	Poor guy, even your staff thinks you are a liar, your family knows you are a liar, andi wish I could read your wife's mind, because you can't be high on her list of great people either. If you had no money you would still be a crazy immature loser, just no one would know.
@realDonaldTrump You are lucky you don't read, Bernstein's book make you look worse than I thought, like a preschooler being kept from sharp objects, like a child kept in his room so adults can speak candidly, like parents speaking of their mentally challenged son. We need you gone and forgotten.
@realDonaldTrump I have gotten 7, never having voted citizens, to vote this fall...hopeful will help facilitate your fall. You disrespect an office, that is so great, quite a few really great men held it, then came you, and false words and deeds. America will overcome your dishonor in time
@realDonaldTrump This not a game to anyone but @realDonaldTrump. To believe that sowing division on a daily basis, stoking fears in people that have to live and work in the reality based world is ok for the @POTUS @potis beyond reprehensible, it is what religious zealots have done, also jim jones
@realDonaldTrump you can sure take credit for the uptick in violence and discourse based on the way people look, act, and choose to be. My hope is someday you feel the full weight of all the negative influence you've had on impressionable children of parents that already use the terms you do
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS You fucking Idiot
@realDonaldTrump You can take credit for bringing us out of the great recession too. Everything you've done for America since 9-11-2001 is amazing too!	Every President of America should bow down to you and tell you they support removing term limits so you can be @POTUS for life, great for U.S.A
@realDonaldTrump How much money would we have to crowd source to get you ( @POTUS )to leave the presidency with pence also?	Tjere are a lot of people tjat will donate to that type of fund.	@FoxNews 	@foxandfriends 	@facebook 	@Twitter 	@Snapchat

@realDonaldTrump Rant and rave while you still can little button man

As per @realDonaldTrump 's metric on #federalemployees pay raises...he must have been hinting at performance and skill level pay rules by accepting no pay for his own job. He was really saying he would be a very bad, really super bad public employee himself.	Bad worker=paid less
Rich and powerful people believe it only takes money to remove a blight created by some of the most heinous acts invented in mankinds eyes. @realDonaldTrump and the @catholicEW @CatholicBishops 	Are great examples of entities amd people that have no fear to do wrong for love of $

@realDonaldTrump I love waking up in paradise and finding our president twitching and jerking around in such distress. He deserves how he feels and will deserve history's long memory as to who he really was. Most Investigated presidency in history is my first guess.
@realDonaldTrump Even if the truth were to pass your lips, it would get dirty from the stains already there.
@realDonaldTrump Poor.
@realDonaldTrump You are a TV president	Acting in name only.	You are weak and insecure in the real world, any decent human being as a friend would ask you to reflect on your issues,as you have no friends except your children you will never hear truth you can accept.For a rich guy,you sure are

@realDonaldTrump But here's a news flash	You are not great 	You cannot fix the damage done to the prestige of the American people by you words actions and lack of desire to do a good job.
@realDonaldTrump Google was unable to promote the words of a proven liar,accused adulterer, racist rabble rouser,enemy of free speech,wishy washy,non presidential,uncouth,self-centered,law breaking,unappealing,unamerican madman before more damage was done as a result.	You had a chance to be great

@realDonaldTrump My ex used to go around telling fictional stories to all her acquaintances,she really had no true friends just like Donald Trump.People stopped listening to her cry wolf just as one day people will wake the fk up and stop listening to you whine and pule about how unfair it all is
@realDonaldTrump and speaking of gut reaction, you have the weakest gut I have ever seen, you aren't really a p__sy grabber, you are just a rich spoiled pussy, you wish you could be strong but it is abundantly clear that you do not have what it takes to rise above anything except your toilet seat
@realDonaldTrump We watch your words evolve around people like a soap opera.	Really great guy to deplorable individual because of your gut reaction.	When they start throwing you under the vehicle en mass it will be a small vehicle for an angry small man like you #hotwheels would be the right size
@realDonaldTrump Read learn govern	Read learn govern	Read learn govern	Read learn govern	Someone should take away your TV privileges and remove the phone from your fingers
@HillaryClinton I have helped people register to vote for the first time in their lives,  I do this solely to help remove donald trump from office,  and am proud to do it
@realDonaldTrump You are right @POTUS the midterms are a referendum on you. It is also a referendum o. How religious leaders cohld back a man with no morals just to push their agenda on people's lives. It is a referendum on the first amendment and your party's continued silence. U right this time
@MichelleObama Great words of encouragement!
@realDonaldTrump What you do is what you read, idiot.
@realDonaldTrump narrow viewpoint and understanding about the flow of all things global makes you an unfit president.The effects of your small minded actions are not apparent to you and your lackeys except where personal profit is involved.Corruption takes many forms but you have created new ones
@realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @UKenyatta @WhiteHouse A shithole country,wasn't it?
@realDonaldTrump Does that include new hotels for you?	Golf courses?
@Pontifex 	You are to be pitied in your house of gold and silver. You who would use a good man's name for generations of cruelty. You are the embodiment of your house and its legacy. You who will remain blind for all the evil it has done. Your Religion is not clean.
@realDonaldTrump Look in the mirror lately?	You are the villain, the whole world sees it, and you do not?	Listen to tv wh__es like @seanhannity @IngrahamAngle @foxandfriends @FoxNews @foxand you will remain blind deaf and as we all have found out dumb.
@Pontifex You people are cruel self serving and greedy.	Your church is based on consolidating power, squeezing cash from those that are neediest, and doing everthing on your power to continue the status quo, even hiding rampant abuses of your own church leaders. I pity you in your house.
@BarackObama K den thats what I'm talkin about...	Whoo hooo shakas to the kids!
@realDonaldTrump @WashTimes Unfortunate that our @POTUS has to speak of himself in the second person, man up and do your job, quit reacting to every perceived (though truth-filled it may be) slight. You could make yourself great again, just quit listening to yourself. Good luck with that, I know.
When you are honest with yourself, your truth becomes relevent. When you fool yourself, your truth is your own. https://t.co/TMLtKnLH77
@kelliwardaz @realDonaldTrump Say anything do anything to be elected, another self-serving self-righteous political wh__e, and now uour intimations that John McCain was even thinking about you on his death bed is amazingly crass
@realDonaldTrump Lol, it was like a custom rsvp especially for you!	#Minusone
@realDonaldTrump One number you can count on is the total number of people at honorable patriot John McCains funeral minus 1,	And 1= donald trump
@realDonaldTrump And the type of people that support our @POTUS will deny it louder than judas and say they were just kidding, when you fall flat from all the slimey crap you create for yourself Donald Johann Drumpf
@Wells82K @Milvio_Diaz @realDonaldTrump I do!
@realDonaldTrump You won you won you won	Is that better?		But it does not make you a winner	It does not make you honorable	It does not make you automatically respected, where you had a chance to make donald Trump great again, you failed.		Your actions speak WAY FUCKING louder than your words
RT @RobertRoupe: I don't have many followers but would appreciate retweets to honor our nephew who gave his life serving his country.  http…
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS #MAGA like it was the day before trump was elected president of the United States. Heartwarming to know that day will come.	And interesting that an honorble man passing away would demand the @potus not come to his funeral. Good people now a bad man when they see him.
@realDonaldTrump You lie even here now.	Your words written ring hollow. what a poor excuse for an honorable man's mention.	@POTUS
@realDonaldTrump I believe there should be a high bar of honorable living standardd in future presidential choices so we do not end up with corrupt,self centered and immature candidates entering a race as important as the presidency.@potus has shown the flaws in our current system	#whenweallvote
@JohnBrennan I should proof read and correct spellings so embarrassingly glaring
@JohnBrennan Wise people understand their places of power, good people use that power to enhance all lives, John McCain was able to be both powerful and honorable, for that we should all be greatful and pause to reflect a moment on our own power-filled motivations
@realDonaldTrump Being humble and real is never going to suit you because nothing comes from your dark heart.	My hope is you end up in a deeper mental decline than you have now.
@realDonaldTrump The way you do business it will probably be drug traffickers doing the deals
@realDonaldTrump Poor donald,  just as the child who always acts as an agressive slathering wolf now wants to be loved because he is acting innocently humble and kind.	You are who you are little donald and the majority of americans see you for who you are, just like your wife does
@realDonaldTrump #lifeoftruth 	#yourwordsmatter	#eyesopentoreality	#caring	#begoodtobebest	#justiceforall	#WhenWeAllVote
@realDonaldTrump Just as a priest stands at a pulpit and proclaims words of truth but acts with evil intent, so too do you stand at your lectern and speak words you proclaim as truth knowing your own truth does not match those words. Poor examples of good both.	Great examples of evil each.	#jesus
@realDonaldTrump Don't make me laugh
@realDonaldTrump All americans need medical care and preventive screening. The appearant disconnect between that reality and @realDonaldTrump 's social agenda is glaring.The rich and well connected really do not care except for their own families and friends.Human nature as played out jungle like
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS you are a do as I say not as I do kind of guy.Loyalty is also a one way street for you. You are loyal to only yourself(probably you are your only friend too) and habe absolutely no use for anyone that doesn't kowtow to your ways,wants,needs.We truly dislike you as a person
@realDonaldTrump Too bad you never read the handbook on being presidential. Wasn't even interested when a real president like @BarackObama tried to give you free lessons. Now all you have thugs, crooks, wannabes, and all your super close friends to advise you with no clue either...Melanidon!
@realDonaldTrump Another special done deal from you I am sure will turn to shit and you will declare it wasn't your fault.I mean how could it be the Melanidon's fault right?
@realDonaldTrump Nutty old bald guy is getting boring https://t.co/aCqbZbNTL4
@realDonaldTrump Yup, silencing all your russian supporters must be a priority, even if it means taking down iranians, chinese, and big couch potatoes in new jersey.
@realDonaldTrump You are the new	Queen of denial Mr trump
@realDonaldTrump Looks the the stress of a liar not remembering all his lies is maki g your cap a bit thin...maybe you should quit while you jabe somebhair left https://t.co/4xafxsNnNr
@cindyhydesmith @realDonaldTrump Do anything say anything to be elected...even agree and support an anti american like trump
@realDonaldTrump @cindyhydesmith Finally the G O P is ready to throw you under the bus to get votes...super funny.	Throw him under	Throw him under	Vote republican and screw that cheesy @potus
@realDonaldTrump Lying cheating scamming dirty dealing marital cheating president of the United States. I am so happy your very cool wife is trolling you...did you block her twitter feed?
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse I bet it was, thank you so much for watching out for us rich folks, we like making more money with less accountability and rules and that is awesome.	Too bad you can't focus on making america better for the other 99%.
@realDonaldTrump You are like smoke	We can see you	We can imagine you smell	But in time you'll be gone	#WhenWeAllVote 	@FoxNews 	@foxandfriends @seanhannity 	@IngrahamAngle 	@SpeakerRyan 	@SenateGOP 	@HouseGOP
@realDonaldTrump All these Issues are making your mental health suffer @potus, you may be the first president in history to be put in a mental institution while in office. A very well deserved distinction!
@realDonaldTrump @MikePompeo4USA @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Idiot	False concern	Self enriching mfr
@realDonaldTrump @NWSHonolulu Hopefully he will treat #Hawaii better than he treated Puerto Rico...he does know Hawaii is a state of America, not "just" a territory of the United States, doesn't he? He really dropped the ball on our fellow U.S. citizens in P.R.
@realDonaldTrump What an asshole you are.	You have no friends and value no people on a personal level. So it is easy to berate and vilify even those who were closest to you when they tell the truth...can't call it fake news
@realDonaldTrump 	@foxandfriends 	@FoxNews 	@seanhannity 	@IngrahamAngle 	@FLOTUS 	We are waiting for your wisdom this morning	Please tell us Mr Trump is still perfect and didn't do anything criminal, please?
@realDonaldTrump They dont love you donald j trump	You are like side show geek in the old days that bit the heads off chickens...	People laugh at you behind your back
@realDonaldTrump Lock you up!                      	.	Lock you up!                     	.                               	Lock you up!
@realDonaldTrump Idiot
@realDonaldTrump You endorse the least best candidate  most of the time
@realDonaldTrump @PARISDENNARD @seanhannity You and yours are embarrassing our country in the eyes of the world, you act like children of a king, demented spoiled, cruel amd unusual...i may have to talk to a lawyer about filing suit against our president for mental stress and ptsd, just due to his twits
@realDonaldTrump And while I'm here...	Fuck you donald j. Trump for your fake concern.
@realDonaldTrump I wo der how many rich people,possibly famous people	are making money off drugs. Many companies were built on the backs of illegal drugs and enterprises. Making drugs a legal choice is the only way to prevent the unfortunate side effects. Society has to distract with opportunity!
@realDonaldTrump Disgraced and discredited...	Will be on your head stone	And sitting at the right hand side of everything that is evil	Will be guess who...The Big @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump And they should be sorry they found out manafort broke the same types of laws that you may have broken @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump Idiotic twit
@realDonaldTrump We are hoping for all recordings papers and emails plus honest answers(good luck right?) from your family and business peeps.
@realDonaldTrump Disrespectful
@realDonaldTrump Jokes gonna b on you big man.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews I never watched your TV show so I haven't seen your good side ( lol -good side) I haven't. Nor have I watched TV period,in this decade and some of the last.  But when your shit hits the fan I just may watch you implode on TV even witj commercials that just like your tweets

@FallingBodies @LaikaSoyuz @soldierlp13 @fermatslibrary As the christian religion grew strong in a club of old men they could make the rules and reap as they would desire...we all know how fundamentally rude and cruel tjey have been
@FallingBodies @LaikaSoyuz @soldierlp13 @fermatslibrary As Mohammed declaref all good muslims must come to assigned points to worship and give thanks they were not told that there was a finacial reason to gather weath for the rulers once a year and preach their brand of exclusion
@FallingBodies @LaikaSoyuz @soldierlp13 @fermatslibrary As the mormons sent their young men to soldier away from home, they were never told it was so the old men could have all the women, because there were not enough for each to have many, jungle shit with shade, send them away or as in the jungle fight and kill the young males.
@FallingBodies @LaikaSoyuz @soldierlp13 @fermatslibrary Sheep
@LaikaSoyuz @FallingBodies @soldierlp13 @fermatslibrary Say true the evils men create for their own ends, though good may have been the seed the tree was fertilized with selfishness and collusion
@realDonaldTrump If there was only something, anything at all that was good and just about you, you might have made a good president, not great, but at least good. You brought your slimey sneaky graft filled world into the white house and changed the discourse for the worst.
@realDonaldTrump You idiot, learn to read, learn to study, think before twittering, and 		You could Be Best
...with disgust and understanding how self serving people can perpetuate wrong ideals just because they can. The USA was built on inclusion not selling visas to the rich,not doing deals with dictators, nor emulating their actions or systems of heavy handed rhetoric to stay in pwr
@realDonaldTrump 	@FoxNews 	@foxandfriends 	@seanhannity 	@IngrahamAngle 	Like a snowball your rhetoric gains momentum and weight dangerously plowing ahead a ball of racism,incomprehensible injustice,and more money for people that don't need it.The future is already looking back

@realDonaldTrump Finance the parade yourself big man...instead of using other people's  money as is your M.O.	You are a greedy self serving turd that teaches those closest to you to stink just like you do. #trumparosa is  a perfect example, you are beneath your office, and clueless as a man.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews And if you are so rich, finance your parade out of your own pocket you dizzy bitch, instead of using other people's money, which is all you've used during your whole life
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Idiot
@realDonaldTrump Parades and rallys, really?	America needs a leader not an insecure little man in charge.
@realDonaldTrump #trumparosa tapes are really the best any presidential administration has produced, can you imagine the movie that will be made, that taxi driver star can play trump or maybe Baldwin.  What fun
@realDonaldTrump Be BEST 	@POTUS		Not yourself
@realDonaldTrump She said anything get your positive attention, just like all the weak willed people still around you...
@realDonaldTrump Poor little self centered man.
@realDonaldTrump You are the mad hatter...not the cool johnny depp one	You are the totally fucked up old bald small peepee mad hatter
It will be great to say goodbye to the Trump presidency no matter how long it takes or under what circumstance.Really Great,the best,most greatest!	@POTUS is embarrassing except to those that think like him. So I want to be the first to say	Goodbye @POTUS	Thanks 4 d service. lol
@realDonaldTrump You think you buy someone when you do something for them @realDonaldTrump realDonaldTru	Just like you to believe people owe you.	Now you just own you.		Own up you cowardly sniveling bitch.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS #psychoDonaldTrump	Did use racial slurs all his life	Ask @MichaelCohen212 or others that did his dirty work in New York real estate.	But someone called @realDonaldTrump to reassure him that ther are no tapes of the apprentice with his racial slurs, but DJT would know best
@realDonaldTrump The thing is	As president of the U.S.A @potus	You have a full disclosure agreement with the american public.	You swore to be lawful, just,and uphold the office honorably.		The moral of your story, is you have no morals or honor		Angry but a coward	Needy but not giving	A real zero
@realDonaldTrump You won the popularity contest Mr. Trump...		Not really,this is fake news
@realDonaldTrump Fake news from a fake president voted in by a minority of Americans?	Or real news from a fake president that is not liked by a majority of Americans.	Ok, it is real news from a president that might as well be russian for all his lies and self dealing. Go trump go, I mean leave.
@realDonaldTrump Everyone around you seems wacky like you donny boy
Can't wait to see how the sunset of @realDonaldTrump 's presidency unfolds...better than reality tv for sure... "you're fired" would be nice to hear in that regard https://t.co/AIGep7lvXU
@realDonaldTrump @GovMikeHuckabee @foxandfriends Economy is great because your predecessor @POTUS44 made hard choices, after George Bush the #decider damaged our economy with poor foresight and false pride. YOU ALSO HAVE FALSE PRIDE. and are helping to repeat GeorgeGWBush's legacy of poor decisions based on personal issues.
@realDonaldTrump @DarrellIssa @foxandfriends You are the @POTUS of criminal intent,your son in law is the same as you, that's why you get along so well,cohen is the same as you. Laws are for other people in your mind. you live in the darkest of gray areas by your own choice.
@realDonaldTrump A man that comments and rates on other peoples wives out loud has no class.	You are in your own class @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump Everybody that has reality based info is a lowlife in your eyes.On the world stage, you are the bivgest lowlife of all, the very biggest, most enormously big lowlife, get used to it.
@realDonaldTrump Will you ever recover from being the most vile presidentin America's history?
@realDonaldTrump A truly spiritual and moral person will not, cannot, should not, support a person like trump.	Would not ignore his inner worth. Will never want to do as @POTUS does. And yet many of the self righteous people do support him. I pity those selling their inner peace for trump
@HillaryClinton @runforsomething We don't live in a perfect world but we do live in a world that can be improved.Our current @POTUS has brought the bar so low that up is really the only direction we can go. It is an infortunate lesson in democracy that the non-voters must learn from.Votes count #WhenWeAllVote
@realDonaldTrump Yell a beat things up	You are sounding increasingly unhinged
@realDonaldTrump And now your people want to sell space force products		Maybe they should sell a trump doll with his thumb  up his butt		Or a trump doll grabbing a pussy because he can do that you know		Or how about only people he likes or lives with can do the chain migration thing		B.S. for all
@IngrahamAngle 	What a self righteous entitlement groping white racist bitch you are.
@realDonaldTrump @DevinNunes @GOP @FoxNews @foxandfriends @FoxBusiness First person in history with two assholes...	And shit comes out both! https://t.co/zxPRHsEOmU
@realDonaldTrump Money grubbing creepers like you are very entertaining, though short sighted
@realDonaldTrump Your people feed you shit so you can't see reality.	I hope you get impeached even though @DevinNunes @GOP @FoxNews @foxandfriends @FoxBusiness tells you otherwise
@realDonaldTrump @GrahamLedger Thank you for this Mr trump.		We all know we can believe  your words because your heart is pure and you do no wrong	Except in relationships, business deals, and in governing of course.
@realDonaldTrump It is a Daydream for an old white rich man. Leave the corrupt and those lacking empathy in power.
@realDonaldTrump Corrupt cruel and foul people are happiest when the man on top is just like them.		@WhenWeAllVote 	for good over bad.	For just laws for all, not just those who can afford justice
@EricTrump @realDonaldTrump Eric Trump for president
@EricTrump @realDonaldTrump Eric trump must be working for the Russians and the Trumps because he doesn't help Americans by supporting his fathers agenda
@realDonaldTrump Russians Trolling Americans on the trump train
@realDonaldTrump Trump train = russians trolling America
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Gotta be russian trolls of america on the trump train
@realDonaldTrump So sad more people voted against you than for you donald trump
@realDonaldTrump Endorse McDonald's 	Not the flawed politcal hacks you pick to help you falsely run our governement
@realDonaldTrump Dump trump	Rock the vote
@realDonaldTrump you seem to be an expert in all things legal. Question: is there a mechanism where enough signatures are acquired to mandate a vote(as citizens) to remove a president from office without congressional input?	@WhenWeAllVote
@realDonaldTrump You are a boring writer trumpmeister
@realDonaldTrump You remind me of a showboat kid on a fast moped always looking around instead of driving,watching to see who is looking at him, who's noticing him, just before he slams into the rear of a truck making a legal,  signal flashing turn.
@realDonaldTrump We don't call it fake news	We call it journalism 		Except tabloid TV like @FoxNews @foxandfriends 	That lie and cover for @POTUS 		Money will make even good journalistic enterprises do bad things
@realDonaldTrump BE BEST BE BEST BE BEST BE BEST		BE BEST NOT WORST @realDonaldTrump realD	Do good not bad	@POTUS 	Look at good people and try to learn how to be a good person too Mr. (I'm a dickhead)Trump
@realDonaldTrump Too bad that good people would accept responsibility for their actions. We do things that may cross the line at times,if you get caught,the measure of a person is how they respond to it, do you lie to get out of trouble or do you stand up like a man and accept responsibility
@realDonaldTrump Dump trump	To make america great again
@MichelleObama @BarackObama A loving couple left the white house then	A couple with issues entered the white house.	Both are indicative of U.S administration's priorities.
@realDonaldTrump You MUST be working for the Russians, Americans in politics do not treat people they disagree with, look different from, or are not as successful as,  in words and actions you promote.	COMRADE Trump probably has a dacha picked out near Putin's house.
@realDonaldTrump What a loser you are.	You could be a winner	But your head is screwed up
@realDonaldTrump Wow that is some slimey shit to throw at someone that using part of his great wealth in an altruistic manner. Have you ever done anything that is not about you?	I would love to hear what your wife truly thinks of you, hearing all this stuff you do.
@realDonaldTrump Please sit down on the record with Mueller
Unlike @realDonaldTrump Chinese people take the very far view in most situations. To believe they will let donald trump win in any contest with the chinese people is foolishly naive.	Long view = chinese	Short narrow view = trump
@realDonaldTrump Come to think of it, we should contact the Guinness book folks and ask them to create your very own, super great, liar record. I mean you deserve to be best at something @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump And i sincerely mean that,	You are the best, without a doubt, liar I have ever seen. 	Guinness book action to be sure!
@realDonaldTrump As daffy duck would say"What a maroon"They set these up for you just so donald trump feels good.We are spending tax payer money for you to travel and be protected, just to distract you from things you can't face like a man.	You are not the best at anything I've seen but lying
@realDonaldTrump @NRCC Act as if you are a fool and you will become one
@realDonaldTrump I encourage everyone i speak to make positive comments about trump to pollsters. Especially if they are against him. What he doesn't  know, will hurt him at the voting booth.
If there was a truth-o-meter on twitter, though bad for people that lie...it would be a great thing for the world.	Allowing people to lie, sure.	But an instant twitter mark that means falsehood after posting would be wonderfilled enlightenment. https://t.co/jKIlPVYIAU
@realDonaldTrump 	A good measure of a president is if you can ask yourself, would this person be a good friend? 	@WhenWeAllVote
@realDonaldTrump @GreggJarrett Lets hope when you get interviewed (read interrogated)by Mueller he lets you run your mouth right into a ditch filled with all your crap. I hope you really believe you can talk your way out(read talk your way into deep shit) my thoughts and prayers are with you @POTUS(read NOT)
@realDonaldTrump Funny thing is you would be a punk in my neighborhood if you didn't have money.Since you do, you'd get punked all the time.What demented part of your mind thinks it is ok to kiss up to dictators and thugs?you've never communicated with or paid off mobsters in business? Schmuck!
@realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @WhenWeAllVote 	When .Mr Trump crows about his 100 million followers... does he realize a few of us are not supporters of his administration? I am a one of the people that follows @ donald trump to call him out when he lies, or when he is cruel, for sure
You and manafort are one and the same, can't stand up like a man and accept responsibility for your actions...too easy to blame others and have lawyers toe your line. 	Truth would be an amazing change for you @potus 	How does your family and wife absorb all your nonsense ? Money
@realDonaldTrump You are a whiner and complainer and ultimately if all else fails a bully to get your way...disgraceful and sad to play out on the world stage. In Poor taste and detrimental to the status of the U.S.A.
@realDonaldTrump The first line was correct...		"Russian collusion with the trump Campaign, one of the most successful in history..." 		You couldn't have written it better @realDonaldTrump
@EricTrump @realDonaldTrump @Acosta Sick as your father eric
@realDonaldTrump Ego boosted now?
@MichelleObama @BarackObama @KingJames @IPROMISESchool Thankyou for your constant positive reinforcement
@realDonaldTrump Poor tampa
@DrREpstein 	Great story on @realDonaldTrump narrow window viewpoints
@realDonaldTrump @SenJohnBarrasso #Whenweallvote again you will not have the pleasure of berating everything you don't like
@realDonaldTrump @SenJohnBarrasso Your mouth moves even as your brains wobble
@realDonaldTrump You are enjoying the discomfort of the majority. Americans are witnessing a brutal governmental regime, perpetrated by an american for a change,we shouldn't be seeing a third world dictator,common african thief,an eastern european or russia thug wannabe as president of USA as U R
@realDonaldTrump You don't need to worry about poor folks, because, you know, they are all lazy, if they would just work hard maybe they would be rich and lazy like you, you freaky toad
@realDonaldTrump And speaking of credit @realDonaldTrump maybe you should just abolish taxes for the wealthy. Poor people don't need to preserve their wealth because they are too busy trying to eat,live indoors,and hope for medical help when life threatening illness appears
@realDonaldTrump You are like a broken record...the one where the men in white suits are coming to take you away ha ha
@realDonaldTrump get some rest, take a vacation, because the shit is going to be hitting the fan soon...and no amount of your bullshit will hide the stench of reality wafting around you, and yours. I pity your family, to have you within their sphere
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS doen't get that the presidency is not a game. He doesn't win or lose, he performs well or he performs poorly...each for the american public all 100 percent of us rich or poor and of unlimited racial extractions and mixes. We, as americans, deserve the very best, not this.
@realDonaldTrump You can lie until you are more orange in the face but the truth will eventually not set you free
@realDonaldTrump Crooked trump	Lying trump	Traitor trump	P grabber trump	Tax cheat probably trump	Wife cheater trump	Criminal trump		This is @realDonaldTrump
I wish you had to live as a poor person lives for 10 days, no contact with rich people, no luxuries, maybe no food for 36 hours, a whole bunch of "No can do" that you couldn't begin to image,the compassion,empathy, and understanding it may begin to create would be good @POTUS
For your info @realDonaldTrump the american economy is strong now because @POTUS44 made difficult decisions and spent our way out of a hole created by geedubya bush. Your tax cut forthe rich will never trickle down to the poor and most needing a pull up in society
@realDonaldTrump of course your lawyer Cohen said you were good,	Don jr. Was honest,and all kinds of things you approved of while you were tight as thieves. But if the current info coming out doesn't make you look in the mirror and take stock of yourself, mentally unfit to serve?
@realDonaldTrump 's appointntees		yes-man, bootlicker, brown-noser, toady, lickspittle, flatterer, flunky, lackey, spaniel, doormat, stooge, cringer, suck, suck-up		You don't want a competent assistant, but a nodding sycophant"		Worst administration of america since before 1776
@realDonaldTrump your way of bringing change is putting yes men in charge of departments, allowing them to install yes men below, that is no way to bring forth informed fact based consensus when all you have is people that never argue in good faith for just and factual solutions.
@realDonaldTrump You are the enemy of reality	@realDonaldTrump 	You cheat and lie and renege on deals. You lie and cheat and threaten to make deals.  Your family is proud of your b.s, racists are proud of your b.s,russia is proud of your b.s,		AMERICANS, NOT SO MUCH!
@BunnyD053 @DeepStateExpose @Christineswfl @realDonaldTrump Like that one I do...
@realDonaldTrump Stop trump	Vote and help people register to vote!	Stop this unamerican madman before more damage is done.	An americam traveling to educated progressive countries has trump rubbed in their face as soon as we are found to be american.	#nomoretrump #neveragaintrump	@WhenWeAllVote
@realDonaldTrump Pandering lying and misrepresenting personal impressions as facts, over and over again...look closely at street level and you will find that employment for people pushed through a broken education system is difficult to find and lowest wage. No bright american dream, just drugs..
I helped another person register after hearing the person explain how @realDonaldTrump is making her feel as an american of foreign descent, 19 years old and ready to rock that vote now!
@realDonaldTrump I am truly sorry @realDonaldTrump 	You must be so insecure inside where no one gets to see,we should feel sorry for you and maybe send hugs and good wishes, ordinarily we would but, you are really special and deserve the extra special treatment you get from the reality based news
@realDonaldTrump You will fail and actually be the top of the list of poorly aclaimed presidents in history,  maybe forever. Ypu reinforce this theory every day, with every tweet and twitch you have. You act like a child tweaker.
@RudyGiuliani you should have taken down your shingle when you still had the love of a nation, not keep it up for the love of a lying showboater like @realDonaldTrump, you both are passed your expiration dates and beginning to smell bad
If one person calls you a liar  you could argue they are wrong,but if our whole country, and the entire world witnesses and calls out your lies, that is some embarrassing shit. Any sane man would have made this a personal rallying cry to change his tune,  slow his roll, be real!
@realDonaldTrump When america says you're fired @POTUS that is when we will begin to make america great again...unless there is irreparable harm you have caused to our standing among nations. The world waits for your exit
@realDonaldTrump don't you have a country to run	You self serving prick?
@realDonaldTrump Truth Is bewildering to @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump @WhenWeAllVote we will ne able to affirm the job you've done, the great greatest, grater that you've been. Pandering without inner conviction like no other has been an amazing hallmark of your life. What a show!	You should be on T.V.

@realDonaldTrump When the rich dictate the terms to the struggling that is not fair.	When the rich would deny the sharing of wealth through compassionate understanding that all people must be pulled up higher and not used as economic fuel,  that is u fair. That you do not understand is not fair!
@realDonaldTrump Donald Trump @realDonaldTrump you are one psycho piece of shit, that you have so much time not being president and hanging around twitter like you do, shows the world how screwed up your head is.	Using the power of @potus this way is as shameful as you are shameless.🇺🇸
Hey big D @realDonaldTrump who's taking care of your tube paste these days?

@realDonaldTrump Some of your junk is made in Russia  now?
@realDonaldTrump In my opinion the presidency is an expense(for the entire world)ego driven aquisition by a man that will never have everything again.	No respect	No friends except hang-arounds	No lasting legacy except for the 1% that benefits from your financial decisions. 	If you quit "be best"

@cher Sometimes our self image of importance becomes a heavy weight that can move us in the wrong direction if we become weak for even a moment. The big picture is most important. While constructive introspection a personal gift.

@realDonaldTrump has to pay more to service his debt because the fed raised interest, as it should. So he puts down the fed with more self serving retoric.
...that what he is saying is the truth and reality as he sees it, which has become apparent that is very often fake facts or outright lies
@realDonaldTrump has a bad problem with using body language while lying, or getting busted for lying.	Crossed arms close to chest means he's truly busted and trying to escape his self made straight jacket.Fingers pinched together arms outstretched, and he is trying to convince us
Today I asked a person that never voted to register, he did online, while i watched I could tell he was excited about it, very vocal about what @realDonaldTrump is doing to hurt his job security @WhenWeAllVote is his chance to be heard too, not just rich political donors
Sooo,if @realDonaldTrump believes his version of reality, and he believes putin's version of reality,how do we know which reality we live in?	Trump's reality? Or the actual happening reality of the here and now? Time to think hard about voting for good over evil, right over wrong
@HillaryClinton @McFaul @realDonaldTrump White house of course

A simple explanation for @realDonaldTrump making conciliatory statements in front of world leaders is a case of brown nose coupled with an inferiority complex and never having a true close friends, once out of eyesight he happily changes reality to suit the next audience

@realDonaldTrump You are the best Trump impersonator @realDonaldTrump we love how you talk about yourself like  you are a movie character
@realDonaldTrump As if we Will you cheesy orange idiot
Funny @realDonaldTrump nato must pay what they owe accordng to they way things should be but when Donald Trump has to pay his bills it is ok to stiff people...sounds about par for the course where a golfer cheats too
Lucky that @realDonaldTrump has no close life long friends...they would be embarrassed for him and would tell him the truth though it may hurt. Friends take care of friends that way. Although if he had friends exactly like him maybe they would plot and scheme like our @POTUS does
I am thinking it is because	@realDonald trump has no intimate super-close friends that might pull him aside over a beer and say "you know we love you but what you are doing is wrong and things you are saying are untrue and maybe it is	time to get this stuff straightened out."
You can make bad choices @realDonaldTrump but own up and be a man when you are caught being less than even you know to be correct and functional.
what our president says means nothing is real unless he believes it.Somewhat self defeating at best and shows a total lack of balls where responsibility for one's actions and words proven false are better met with humble acceptance and change, our @potus is a poor example for all
I keep trying to understand how @realDonaldTrump can equate a strong denial by putin with unequivocal truth.	I imagine it falls in the same realm as @POTUS saying everything that is disseminated about him that he does not like is fake news. We understand that
A vote for @realDonaldTrump is a vote for putin
Он моя сука
@realDonaldTrump have you learned  how to say	"He's my bitch" in russian	Putin and his pals say it all the time,  and rightly so.

@realDonaldTrump We knew you would side with putin over the USA
@realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump you are a pussy. Grab yourself. Lol
PUtin has @realDonaldTrump 's envy because putin can Actually Shut Down media that doesn't kowtow,putin can disappear people that disagree in a valid manner,putin is actually the final word on anything he turns his attention to,trump or putin,putin or trump, dictators and thieves
@realDonaldTrump most likely the first @potus in history that wants to, and would if he could, declare himself emperor,dictator, president for life,disband congress,put a family member on to the @scotus,another in charge of justice dept,maybe personally paid for private army,wtf!
@realDonaldTrump believed every word putin said today, and will let the american public know what a great guy putin is, and maybe that he has "Don Trump's" back. It is the things he does't tell us and questions he answers untruthfully that we have to fear. Misguided @potus he is.
@realDonaldTrump I wonder if this was a lie too.	Liars are hard to believe even when they tell the truth

@HillaryClinton Wow, I can i.agine how normal and people friendly your admin would be right now, how even the people that voted against you(minority that they are) would have better access to health care and so much more, I voted for you and will vote against any trump supporter, period
@realDonaldTrump Mostly,@realDonaldTrump we have learned that we cannot trust your words, cannot trust  your motivation, cannot trust much about you, or your moral compass, so yes even when something you do goes almost right, like NK, we have to imagine your self serving business interest first
@realDonaldTrump After you are long gone and forgotten America will heal
@realDonaldTrump Your responsibility to do something about it now	@realDonaldTrump
If everything is fine w/ @realDonaldTrump &amp; putin then it would be no problem to have every word between them recorded for posterity.Unlikely to happen,of course,as the russian's motives are way too advanced for our @POTUS to comprehend,putin has a gangster style napoleon complex

@realDonaldTrump is  converting others into believing that lies are ok in the pursuit of narrow minded ends. When a president has no values or morals, children do not have a positive role model. Some things cannot be glossed over with kind words, our president is one suck puppy.

@realDonaldTrump 	As a hater and a racist you should know that most americans are hatists(we hate haters)&amp; inclusionary radicals(we believe in live and let live but not to the faults you promote) @vote is our voice(most americans voted against you) @voters will prevail in the end
@realDonaldTrump How about working hard to get low income families medical services they need.of course not the Cadillac plan you have(that would be so unfair)how about acting like a father? not a scrooge moneygrubber	Brown nose	Condescending	King with the new clothes
@realDonaldTrump Make your presidency great by putting yourself in the shoes of people that work paycheck to paycheck before you choose to make changes that effect their bottom line,instead of focusing on those that have more than enough and just want more because they can, your choices are sucky
@realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump your choices dont effect you, you dont have to worry about cost, medical coverage, your children's childrens welfare, you dont have to hire americans, mostly you are immune to the actions you take,  you should be ashamed of yourself, but that would take heart.
@realDonaldTrump sometimes winning doesn't make you a winner.sometimes losing doesn't mean you lost.but with you, being a winning loser is probably the best thing this country could get.  Future USA will use your presidency in ways you would not want, to do things you can not do
@BruceAshford @FoxNews @FoxNewsOpinion I wish we could see in your heart...your deepest secret desires...your deepest secret thoughts...are you the man you present yourself to be...or are you, as many are, a facade?

It is a sure sign of mental illness and insecurity to base an argument on imaginary facts that support a goal that is self serving and self created. @realDonaldTrump drops seeds of rotten fruit to see what grows in an image he approves of, regardless of damage it may create.

@realDonaldTrump @potus ...if you could just say or do something once,  that makes everyone in America smile for a moment, it would be a nice change, anything really, that doesn't promote hate, or fear, or condescension... thank-you, if you do

@realDonaldTrump is truly a @foreverythings. he will be a future gauge as in, don't try to trump us again or we got trumped once never again or how about you go trump yourself or open your eyes before you get trumped
@realDonaldTrump get real.
The U.S.A is greater than any one perspective, any one economic group, any one political viewpoint, any one religion,any sport or team...to obsess about your own perspective to the detriment of others. it is what wrong minded people do it is what dictators do. 2000 years of same?
Does @realDonaldTrump understand that he does not live in the america where people sruggle from paycheck to paycheck, choosing between one need and another because the money can't stretch, when you never want for anything you cannot understand the world most of us live in.

Removing/separating children from parents is wrong...but as a deterrent it is impressive...maybe we should remove children from people/companies that commit financial crimes,  instead of the slap on the wrist pay a fine we hear about all the time	@realDonaldTrump

@Comey  , i hope when the allowed truth comes out you are vindicated with regard to Mr Trump, your career was well grounded in service, and I believe your future is bright, thank you for all that you are.
in the year 2020 of the current era, we will see which way is strongest in our great country, division and injustice, or inclusion and enlightenment. kinder and gentler was what one president said, and another tried to deliver @GWBush @BarackObama  and now...
@BarackObama I just read that a million of your books will be donated in your name...lol, sounds just like something you and @MichelleObama would organise...kudos!
being in any group that promotes bad ideas outwardly towards other groups	is unforunate. i do not single out any group but all groups, by example, that bracket and corral others, my religion is peace, my desires unfulfilled, my hand held out to all
my empathy is tiring and very painful...again tears for understanding how powerful, comfortable people can create so much pain and sorrow for other people that should be able to live in peace...i will not list entities, for the possible holes to poke in my thinking are easy
I kindof miss @POTUS @BarackObama he seemed more in tune with the human condition, thoughtful, considerate, you could often tell that he could have said more...but thought first, before speaking, understanding the power of words...Yes, I miss you and your aloha style...thank-you
I can feel the future creeping up on us like a cat stalking a mouse, in our ignorance and trusting belief that it can't get as bad as all that...

The history of our planet is littered with great civilizations that are no more. Today is no different as greed and violence dominate.
Now is most important when history creates positive futuresteps

Truth can be trumped by bluster,	Only the morally weakest among us are deceived.
When rich people complain about not making enough new money,	It shows one of the follies of humanity
No politicians should speak, engage, communicate with people in business without a witness, and recording. So no more inside deals
Right now i am sitting in a glade among koa trees,	I hear birds, and am not at peace, as it seems no one can be	that thinks.
Prifit hoarders that believe and #teach getting more money is the only way, have created this dangerous path humanity walks now.
If you are in business only to make money, you are not	serving others, you actually selfserve from others.
Focusing on inclusion through economic growth,	and creating the resulting inequality only shows	our ignorance, and lack of humanity
What if everyone just went home, and then looked around to make sure everyone else has one too. Would that be so hard?
Today my truth is home with the flu,	Lol-not
Today's #truth is only true,	To those with a common view.	Thankfully, my truth, is my own.	As your's should be too
Now words can mean no but say yes.	 words can sound good	But be bad
In the beginning there was good and bad, yes and no...	We have created vocabulary that deminishes the clarity.

Thankyou to all those who know they provide a positive counterbalance to the negative rationals of others
People can be cruel, incapable of compassion as a group, within almost any field or organized human structure. As policy.

Positive reflection on experiences gained, should be a priority, rather than overwriting  reality w/ undirected #futuretalk
Sounded like a football game as i passed one block from the democratic national	Convention riot in 1968, i was 12

You have never given charity	if you've taken a tax write-off	every time. 	I pity you, in your ignorance.
I cry for us all, forced to submit to visual and mental stresses that we could change, if not for selfish groups of people.
If everyone is heading one way, a wise man may choose the other.
If worldwide, everyone had enough to eat and a place to feel home...
"...life liberty and the pursuit of happiness" we need to guarantee every american a life.	Some people cannot "do" or "get" in our system.

Our system is the same system used throughout history, people create prosperity, others take more than their fair share.
Most people would say(over 50% of the world's population) and believe, that dividing everything of value
those that trade in value must remove a portion of that value each day, so at the end of the day there is less than the day before. everyday
let the man with no food sit at the table to discuss profits with those that would take an unfair share of food.@occupywallstreet
time for you to worry, as the pharoahs and kings were brought down, so shall you feel the quaking of millions of disaffected
when that percentage of your earnings necessary to feed yourself becomes so insignificant that you cannot even calculate the percentage
as the education system shows you...when the money flows down from on high...very little is changed at the bottom
amid all that we have been taught to expect by toeing a line formed by our government
the people protesting are not really protesting at all...they are trying to find personal relativity #OccupyWallStreet
somehow allowing people that are already beyond wealthy, acquire more from the world's financial pot...is some really fd up s__T

going to my significant other in a while, I am a lucky guy, merry merry ho ho ho
be.do.repeat...
quite an adventure yesterday...rain...rain...floods and magical waterfalls everywhere
truly...religion equals lack of freethought, just as governments including ours promote lack of freethought by deceptive governance..USA
people with money shape policy for people with money to get more money, profit equals that for which no value is given.
support truth in government worldwide...business and governance should not be bedfellows.
open to the human condition brings me emotional overload
Last Sunday's adventure:Hoomaluhia garden lake, we hiked and explored until our feet hurt...some cool stuff and beautiful hiking there,ducks

I cried though the main preformance at SeaLifePark  they were tears of understanding, connections between living things...behind my shades.

forever is a dream  for little children poorly conceived by adults this conditioning our fatal flaw never balanced used as bait

a love/hate relationship seems to be the strongest of all, um...for my friend I mean.
teaching my son to boogie board in the backsplash from maili beach breakwater, waves were perfect for him...I mostly chilled and smiled

If you don't have your own Toilet, then man, you are poor...or in jail.
I believe "That no one should have everything, if some people have nothing."
Today is a really really great day for everything...
In the beginning it is hard to see the end...
