@JoeBiden you jeopardized medicare when you cut $700 billion to pay for ObamaCare.
@PaulRyanVP said they got caught with hands in the cookie jar by turning Medicare into a bank for ObamaCare.  #repealObamaCare
RT @PaulRyanVP: This is not what a real recovery looks like. Proud to stand w/ @MittRomney, who is uniquely qualified to get the job done.
@JoeBiden said he always means what he says.  So I guess he does think that the middle class has been buried the last four years.
Opportunity and upward mobility is what @MittRomney and @PaulRyanVP will bring to America. #jobs #debates #VPdebates
@JoeBiden and @BarackObama's track record of failed stimulus, bailouts, buyouts &amp; cash for clunkers didn't get America back to work.
