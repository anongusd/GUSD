There are other non-governmental goals for the pro-life movement, of course (culture of life, culture of support for mothers of young children, etc.).		But on the legal front, that's the thrust of what I want.
Since you asked: the goal (for me, at least, I don't claim to speak for every single pro-lifer) is the legal forbidding of all elective abortion and the allowance of abortion in cases of genuine threat to the life of the mother.
Because in my experience, the pro-choicers who ask the question already think they know the answer ("subjugate women" or some such rhetorical bull), and they simply look for ways to read that answer into the answer the pro-lifer tries to give rather than listen honestly. https://t.co/Ml1D7SACHi
