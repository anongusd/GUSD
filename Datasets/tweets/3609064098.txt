If we unleash the entrepreneurial and innovative spirit of America, we will once again have the greatest economy in the world.
We need to remove the excessive regulations and tax burden that hampers economic growth and stifles innovation.
I believe that many of the problems facing our country are best solved by the private sector.

Faith compels us to pray for the families of victims and survivors. But, it's time for our government to get serious about national security
