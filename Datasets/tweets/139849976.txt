@V_actually "Do you require a safe space?" Too funny!
@FrankPallone What do you call 100,000's of people being detained at the southern border each year? A picnic? Why are you saying all those children being detained is an emergency but saying it's not at the same time. WHY are these people leaving those countries in such numbers??

@TIME These people ignored Hillary destroyed evidence, let her go scott free with everything she and Obama did while in office, but can't sleep unless they get Trump for something, anything. They'll make laws retroactively making it illegal 4 anyone to blink 3+ times in a row &amp; get him
@RepJeffries Quite frankly it is, but you will never admit it because your pride won't let the likes of you on the left.

@WalshFreedom So were you this vocal about Obama's emergency 4 Venezuela? One of many for other countries, mind you. Interesting congress upheld it last yr. too wonder if it's NOT upheld this yr. the blockade will stop? Research plz about what Obama really did while in office. You'd be shocked
@RepSwalwell You are nothing more than an arrogant puppet that thinks he's above the law because of your connections. Newsflash, Buttercup, you're not. Tell your handlers their next once we get done putting the likes of you behind bars. #JusticeComing

@mysterysolver3 My friend has a very hard time finding work in construction BC contractors are paying illegals less, &amp; they're flooding the work force. He also said since Trump's been in office, more jobs are available BC more illegals are being shipped back. Also, you must put blame on parents

@repmarkpocan So you're accusing a duly elected president by 63+ MILLION Americans of being a dictator w/o any evidence. Yet, @ the same time, supporting an actual brutal dictator stopping aid to his country. You're a genius. No wait, not genius. Moron. You're a moron. So are your handlers lol
@AOC They "forced the other 200+"?? HOW exactly did they FORCE them? Ever stop to think, LMFAO look who I just asked, &amp; realize those 200+ probably know the benefits ICE provides &amp; thought for themselves &amp; voted for a pro-ICE provision?

@CBSNews These people won't believe the truth if it fell from the sky and landed on their face. They're dead set on disbelief simply to oust Republicans to gain more power. They care not for any of the people they claim they do, just uses them.
@AOC @JackPosobiec @OANN I've seen you post things others said trying to put them down. You're no different.

@AnonEV_H @Anon2World Try researching before putting down mine. Since 1994 at least Billy Boy was building walls/barriers. The G's been talking to many owners along the border already cutting deals. Have been for decades. It's all public info to find if one should choose to look. But WTF do I know...
@AdamSchiff How about BOTH PARTIES take a look @ WHY all those people are leaving those countries in Central/South America? All this $ flying around both trying to keep them out and other places to help them when they get here illegally. WHY ARE THEY LEAVING IN SUCH NUMBERS?!? No answers????
@Anon2World @AnonEV_H There's been so many technologies suppressed
@Anon2World @AnonEV_H I couldn't agree more. I've been saying how come no leader's been talking about why they're leaving these places.
@Anon2World Watchdog is pretty reliable. That's what I was really going off on. I hear they do a wide range of studies on their own...
@MeredthSalenger @Twitter I don't condone violence but everyone's voice should be heard and our leaders should listen to us and decide what's best. This is ridiculous, pitting sides against each other, we all need to get along.
@AnonEV_H @Anon2World The wall plan's been on 4 decades. It's been funded 4 as long. This whole thing is smoke &amp; mirrors. The land's either already been bought or deals made w/ people near the border. From what I've read the G owns it already. What people think is the border they're up against, isn't
@Anon2World Not my place to judge either. I'm just here to lay it out so you all can play it out
@Anon2World https://t.co/8CjncZCaNu https://t.co/DA1x3tWSl9
@Anon2World I don't believe either side truly cares about the average person which is a shame. At least the Republicans are giving us lip-service &amp; not the rest of the world. How about they both get together and save humanity? No, they're down to take each other down. The Cycles end
@Anon2World Snarky much? Who says I don't care about those people coming here? I'm saying our money is mismanaged
@Anon2World For sanctuary cities/states to keep the cost of housing, feeding, giving medical to the immigrants, it costs money. https://t.co/nxEkixPFGT even sites the figure. Simple Google search will show.
@Anon2World I don't argue that one bit. But I'm not the one hung up on money. The Democrats don't want to fund $5 billion for a wall but spend over $116 BILLION a year bringing in, feeding &amp; giving medical to immigrants. Makes no sense to me

#BuildTheWall #TuesdayThoughts The left wants to say $5 BILLION is too much for national security saying there's no emergency. At the same time saying they want upwards of $93 TRILLION/$600k per house or the world will end in 12 years. Go figure. Imagine that.
@Thomas1774Paine Nothing like saying I'm not a racist than banging her gavel and shouting, "A black woman has the gavel now"...
@KamalaHarris So maybe go to the officials in the countries these people are fleeing and talk to them and ask them why are they fleeing? No, blame Trump for them bringing their kids. Blame him for policies that's been around for decades. You're smart. But not that smart.
@RepDWStweets @DeptVetAffairs @SecWilkie You can't even use millions of $'s to stop TWO mass shootings in your own district. Where's that $ going? You think you can talk about $ spent for government programs in the VA as opposed to privatizing? Wow. https://t.co/wPQMy33C76
@RepTedDeutch You did NOTHING when Obama was declaring emergencies all over the place. You did nothing when many were upheld last year, many for other countries under "national interests". Yet you won't support one for Americans under Trump? GTFOH you're a hypocrite, liar, puppet. Shame on you

@CNN Never mind @KamalaHarris' bill she just passed and how she used Jusse to pass it. She'll use hers and her friends pull to get as light a sentence as possible I'm sure. Pathetic display of power for identity politics. No wonder her father denounced her style.

@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Quit lying to the American public. The National Emergencies Act of 1976 gives FULLY AUTHORITY for ANY sitting president to declare an emergency. Obama declared several and several are STILL enacted. Go, sit down, have a drink, and let adults handle things now.

@KamalaHarris Did YOU look up the IP #'s given to us by IC? Cause I did and low and behold not a SINGLE ONE originated from Russia. Here's 4 of 6, the others will be attached.

@AndrewGillum Counting every vote is important. However, the voter that cast the ballot should be a LEGAL citizens. Otherwise we're getting foreigners to decide our elections... Now, I'm no genius in the subject but isn't that important to keep them out of our elections?

@davidhogg111 @raehanbobby Why'd you say it was 9:32 AM? Why are the shadows low to the ground as opposed to 2:30 PM? How'd you know it was Cruz B4 he was caught?

@RepAdamSchiff Moron, The National Emergencies Act of 1976 allows a sitting president to do so. Obama STILL HAS 16 enacted to this day. Sit down, putz. You're not above the law, you're time behind bars is coming closer each second. Be scared #JusticeComing

@ukudigada @davidcicilline @SenWarren Oh, oh, TRAIL... my mistake... he capitalized TRAIL... yeah you're right, let's string him up *rolls eyes*
@ukudigada @davidcicilline @SenWarren Trump was never called one until he ran against the establishment. Think about that. My opinion on the Trail of Tears, much like the tweet, plays no role in this whole thing. Again, people like you brought it up. All he said was TEARS.... https://t.co/zokr2LmEj0
@WalshFreedom OK, I can understand politicians but why you're saying this deceleration is king-like makes no sense. You seem intelligent, don't you read? Try reading the National Emergencies Act of 1976 https://t.co/TzeMmn4N1m
@ukudigada @davidcicilline @SenWarren So calling someone a fake for lying about their race is being a racist in your eyes?
@ukudigada @davidcicilline @SenWarren DON'T put words in my mouth TYVM. At NO point did I OK racism. I don't know how you came to that conclusion. YOU'RE the one along with the rest that tried to tie racism into the tweet. You're perpetuating the whole racism theme they want you to simply agreeing saying it's racist
@ukudigada @davidcicilline @SenWarren Why should I be? He didn't directly mention the event... He said the word tears in caps... Oh no, how terrible...

@PPact Yeah, but no. It's not an abuse of power because in 1976 congress passed the National Emergencies Act giving a sitting president FULLY AUTHORITY to declare an emergency.
@RepAndreCarson Maybe U can answer these. Why'd Hogg say it was 9:32 AM? How'd Hogg know it was Cruz B4 he was caught? Why'd officers w/ "eyes on suspect" let him go 4 over 80 mins? Do u know avg. response time 4 SWAT let alone 100's of officers/FD/paramedics 2 arrive on scene? Why MSM on scene? https://t.co/6uEqT1ManD
@RepCartwright @AppropsDems You DO realize the National Emergencies Act of 1976 passed in, 1976, right? Are you truly this ignorant or are you pleasing your handlers?
@RepCartwright @AppropsDems If you're worried about $ being spent, try considering how sanctuary cities/states let ANYONE in and get the rest of Americans to pay for the ILLEGAL immigrants room, board, food, medical.
@D__Luxxx @ceicli @NathanLerner @TheDemCoalition Yeah, STFU before you hurt yourself. I'ma mute you now after I tell you to take a look at who follows me. Then I'll ask why would they if they think I'm so full of it... Moron
@RepEspaillat You know, when you &amp; your party say stuff like this, it just magnifies your ignorance on the subject. Either that or it shows the whole world you're lying. Please, sit down &amp; shut up if you're going to continue to spread lies. TYVM https://t.co/vTzEKiFIBV

@WalshFreedom I remember when he tried doing that, the left blew up at that too. The man can't win...
@D__Luxxx @ceicli @NathanLerner @TheDemCoalition Yet that's not what the person put. The person put Trump's economy. You all want to be nitpicking at the man, but you can't handle it when it comes back your way.
@ukudigada @davidcicilline You're a plebe, an assuming plebe. How dare you assume my feelings about the situation. I find it more offensive @SenWarren pretended to be something she's not than the fake outrage you &amp; the likes of you are showing for that tweet. Again you assume that's what he meant. Pathetic
@JackPosobiec Pics or it didn't happen
@SenMarkey Those only work at ports of entry. Otherwise the drug flow can continue unimpeded in areas without a wall. You can honestly say drones or whatever will stop the flow without the need of a wall? Damn, you're one special kind of stupid.
@ceicli @NathanLerner @TheDemCoalition Can you NOT read? It starts off "Trump's economy"...
@Boomdedz @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump The point is, any president can declare one. Period.
@WalshFreedom Considering how much Nance was bragging about not going to offer him a thing, then come back and offer what she did, I'd say he's not too bad... But WTF do I know, right?
@NathanLerner @TheDemCoalition And in all those examples you're implying it's Trump's fault which is insane in of itself. Trump's been around since 1920's? Trump is keeping money out of 69%? National debt ALL occurred under him? A record # are late solely BC of Trump? GTFOH moron. TDS is strong with you. Sad
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump You are either EXTREMELY stupid, or 100% flat out lying. The National Emergencies Act of 1976 gave ANY sitting president FULL AUTHORITY to declare a national emergency. Sit down before you fall down, lush
@lsarsour So 100,000's of arrests at the border last year, and those were ONLY the ones caught, ISN'T an emergency? https://t.co/vTzEKiFIBV
@SenJeffMerkley Gee, I'm no expert or anything but maybe, JUST MAYBE, you all should have come up with a better deal before he declared it?
@ukudigada @davidcicilline I'm sorry, you're blaming what when on to our people on Trump? Wow.
@FetusKebabs @daggerandpen @m0ckingbird_usa @StormIsUponUs Yeah, no. It's not about any particular party. If you're still hung up on that, then you're going to be in denial of lots of things that are 100% true and 100% covered up by people in high places.

@tedlieu @AnnCoulter It wouldn't be a day without you spending all of it attacking our president rather than do the job you were elected to do, which is to help your constituents. At 8.6% unemployment I'm sure they LOVE seeing you go after him like you are. REALLY helps them get work... Moron
@GDingers @StormIsUponUs @m0ckingbird_usa Right, because hedge funds, banks, congressmen, diplomats AND ambassadors ALL follow stupid/insane people for the hell of it... Sit down, adults are doing adult things now. Back to the kiddy table. https://t.co/TT8oGh3ZfH

@tedlieu @POTUS Are you trying to be this stupid? Or does it come naturally to you? The National Emergencies Act of 1976 gives the sitting president FULL AUTHORITY to declare such a thing. You're pathetic Teddy R. Your handlers are a joke. #JusticeComing you're NOT invincible

#NationalEmergency #BuildThatWall everyone that says walls don't work, move out of your house and live in the open air from now on. You wanted protection so you have a house w/ walls, right? Well, quit it cause you don't need protection, your government will protect you! Bwahahah

@AC360 @RepCohen For someone violating the First Amendment blocking people on social media while ranking member on Subcommittee on the Constitution &amp; on Civil Justice	Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property and the Internet, he sure knows nothing about the National Emergencies Act of 76 https://t.co/Z7mZB6Ybgy
@RepDWStweets You, you DO realize congress ALREADY gave the sitting president FULL AUTHORITY to declare national emergencies, right? In fact, in 1976 congress passed National Emergencies Act for the president to do so. Please, sit down. Next.

@eliznoelle @noah_donald98 @ShawnFraser13 @RepTedDeutch That's very wise, I didn't want to be silent anymore either. So I started researching things on my own and have found some very disturbing things going on, so I'm speaking out and trying to wake others.
@eliznoelle @ShawnFraser13 @noah_donald98 @RepTedDeutch There's been others that don't seem right, yes. Maybe follow me and direct message me to talk further? But the high profile ones as of late are suspect to me. Again I'm not saying NOTHING happened, that'd be a hoax I'm calling, I'm saying it's a false flag where something did.

@eliznoelle @noah_donald98 @ShawnFraser13 @RepTedDeutch Likewise, I enjoy a healthy conversation with a rational person that responds in an adult manner the way you did.
@eliznoelle @ShawnFraser13 @noah_donald98 @RepTedDeutch Maybe, JUST MAYBE, if the local PD/FBI actually focused on Cruz beforehand when they were warned, this wouldn't have happened. But, for some reason, they chose to ignore it and let it happen. Stop to think; why they would knowing he was a threat? No, punish others taking away #2A
@RonWyden So you're going to dispute the fact that 100's of 1,000s got arrested @ the border last year? And those are ONLY the ones that were caught. Scary NO ONE'S mentioning WHY they're leaving the countries. Just blame Trump for trying to do something about it.https://t.co/vTzEKiFIBV
@noah_donald98 @ShawnFraser13 @eliznoelle @RepTedDeutch I've never once mentioned my party affiliation, but good to know you assume I am a Trump supporter without any actual proof that I am. Once again proving gullible people such would rather be in their safe space than believe the truth. Truth is their narrative doesn't hold water
@noah_donald98 @ShawnFraser13 @eliznoelle @RepTedDeutch I'm sorry but if you have to resort to name calling, then what good do you bring to this conversation? You're showing the emotional response THEY want you to and to react off that. THEY don't want you to think, just believe them. Have fun believing it...
@ABC Why'd Hogg say it was 9:32 AM? How'd Hogg know it was Cruz B4 police caught him? How'd 100's of officers/FD/paramedics along w/ #MSM arrive on scene as it was happening AND STILL manage to let suspect go? Even though officers had "eyes on" him the whole time. #FalseFlag https://t.co/xnaBWZMJgJ
@ShawnFraser13 @noah_donald98 @eliznoelle @RepTedDeutch Pay no mind to him, Shawn. They can't stand free thinkers.
@ericswalwell @HouseJudiciary Why'd Hogg say it was 9:32 AM? How'd Hogg know it was Cruz B4 he was caught? Why'd Hogg give several stories as to where he was that day? How was #MSM &amp; 100's of officers/FD/paramedics able 2 be on scene as it was happening? #FalseFlag How did suspect escape w/ "eyes on" him? https://t.co/wjpU5oRA7s
@eliznoelle @RepTedDeutch You mentioned gun control and only the G can do something like that. As for specific names, I'm unable to give you that since I'm not involved in the conspiracy itself. I'm just postulating a theory that this event didn't happen the way The Powers That Be say it happened is all.
@eliznoelle @RepTedDeutch What's more harmful is believing the official narrative w/ more holes than Swiss cheese. NONE of the ones in the spotlight were confirmed to be in the same building.

@eliznoelle @RepTedDeutch Certainly a possibility now isn't it? The local police were called dozens of times about Cruz, even the FBI knew about the risk he posed yet did nothing? If you think our government wants what is best for us, you have to do more research.
@eliznoelle @RepTedDeutch All I'm saying is to use your mind about these things. SOMETHING happened &amp; those not directly involved can only use the evidence @ hand 2 determine what exactly took place. Video evidence has Hogg saying it's 9:32 AM &amp; him saying it was Cruz before he was caught. Think while can
@ewarren #FalseFlag Why did Hogg say it was 9:32 AM? How did Hogg know it was Cruz? Why did officers w/ "eyes on suspect" let him go? Why was #MSM there w/ these shots? Why did Hogg change his story so many times? Why's Kasky hanging out with Ohr? #WakeUpAmerica https://t.co/SAQweP8S9E
@ABC Yet, you were right there taking these wonderful shots for the world to see? AS it was happening no less, all TOO convenient if you ask me. All those officers there too, some had "eyes on suspect" yet ALL let him go? Imagine that. #WakeUpAmerica #FalseFlag
@Jack #WhoHurtJack As I've yet to be put in "time out" we can all assume it was a priest that made you this angry @ the world.

@HomelandDems @realDonaldTrump You, you DO REALIZE that it IS actually being built, right? This has been in the works long before Trump came to office, you realize this right? Or are you just playing the part?
@eliznoelle @RepTedDeutch Don't be ridiculous, we're trying to have an adult conversation here. At least I am. I'm not saying nothing happened, never did. All I'm saying it didn't happen the way they tell us. How could all those stations be there to take the footage of all the officers leading students?
@eliznoelle @RepTedDeutch It's a false flag, as noted in my first post. The difference being a hoax is a straight up lie where NOTHING happened. A false flag is something did happen but not the way they said it did.
@eliznoelle @RepTedDeutch What difference does that make? You're avoiding the truth, and that's you're afraid to recognize the plain and obvious facts right in front of you. You'd rather cling on to your emotional response than admit there could be something wrong w/ the whole situation.
@eliznoelle @RepTedDeutch Average response for SWAT is 50 mins. yet 100's of officers &amp; FD &amp; paramedics were on scene along w/ SEVERAL news outlets. Use common sense &amp; logic rather than emotion-based responses, you MIGHT learn something.
@eliznoelle @RepTedDeutch Truth hurts, doesn't it? Don't want to believe your government would do such a thing.

@MSNBC @CNN Where's your coverage of your golden boy in Europe now? He's not trashing our president about nationalism now is he? Not covering the anarchy going on in France, why? Your handlers won't let you. Good sheeple you are. https://t.co/ZhOOBUWK52

@peterjhasson Got another spazzing out here! LMFAO!!! Oh you snowflakes are so fun to watch melting!!! https://t.co/aPGKLGIHWl
@RepAdamSchiff @RepJayapal What's a strain is letting them in freely into sanctuary cities/states and giving them whatever they want. It costs over $116 BILLION PER YEAR. Don't dare talk about that though, right you piece of Schift

@armani_salado @JackPosobiec Reminds me of the opening scene of Planet of the Apes
@kylegriffin1 MSNBC viewers &amp; those commenting here are hysterical! NOW they're all for the Constitution. NOW they are... The irony is dripping off Lieu and the rest of you. Those of you censoring conservatives on social media, wanting to rid guns but NOW you want to bring up the Constitution
@EmmanuelMacron blood is on your hands still and yet you hide like a coward! Resign! Shame on you!!! You're no leader to your people, you're a traitor to them, a bitch to the EU!!!! https://t.co/cQcqcM5g53
@RepJayapal @HouseJudiciary @TheJusticeDept How about questioning WHY those people are leaving those countries 2 come here &amp; stop going after the men &amp; women doing their jobs? How about actually showing concern for them BEFORE they arrive illegally in America? Can you do that? Doubtful, you're not being told to by handlers
@davidhogg111 Tell us again where you were that day please, I need a laugh. All news stations already set up 2 get angles of 100's of officers leading students out 2 dozens of fire/medical already set up. You saying 9:32 AM. #WakeUp #FalseFlag You're a very small pawn, Hogg, enjoy your 15 mins https://t.co/wgk5rigHsH
@emrazz "Toxic" is subjective. Not sure why it's bothering people like you now so much. It's a shame in "The Land of the Free" people like you cast judgement, ridicule, &amp; start isolating people simply for being themselves. Don't like a "toxic masculine" man, ignore him, move on w/ life
@RepJayapal @MotherJones More than you did when Trump was mentioning how child trafficking has gone down since he's been in office. You just sat there w/ a sourpuss face like your cash supply is running out. Why is that? #FollowTheMoney #JusticeComing your handlers are next after you.
@StephenKing I think I have a great idea for a book myself. It's about an author that died in a crash, but was cloned. Only, the clone's a evil son of a bitch who's totally different than the original. Everyone sees it but says nothing because, well you know... https://t.co/Go29EkIW9E

@JeannaEckert @mattgaetz @CB618444 Coolacious https://t.co/e7MpQavkdy
@RepJayapal @HuffPostPol For DECADES policies under each president have been basically the same, NO outrage by you nor the Democrats. Not even under Bush Jr. so why now? Your actions, or lack there of, during SOTU showed plenty about you. You're a disgrace to humanity only out for power &amp; money. Shame!!!
@RepJayapal "I really showed passion, I did!! I mean, I'm so passionate about children separated from families! Passionate I tell you! Passionate! I LOVE children, passionate about them!!" ... Meanwhile she sat with a sourpuss face hearing how much child trafficking's gone down under Trump.
@JeannaEckert @mattgaetz @CB618444 Well, I'll follow you! I looked just the other day at this one tweet this person was responding to but I couldn't see who they were responding to, so funny!!

@SenSchumer @FreedomForumIns The vast majority of people in the press are bought out to stay in line and drive home the narrative The Powers That Be want. They took a course in college, that's it.

@BreitbartNews Too bad Louis CK wasn't there to jerk off in front of her, maybe she'd feel at ease then?

@FBI how's it feel to be the rich's bitch? Think you're serving justice? I think you're serving a pile of shit to the American people claiming you're for them.

@RepTedDeutch @washingtonpost Last year over 44 journalists were killed, 2 right here in America, American citizens and nary a word from you. You're choosing to ignore it.
@Anon2World @AOC Oh I'm at peace... I'm wide awake, question is are you? If you can't see she's being controlled already, I pity you. No offense, just you need love and light in your heart. You're blinded by mirrors and smoke and fail to see who's pulling their strings.
@SocialismStench @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Never saw him before, but he's my favorite!
@Anon2World @AOC "Divine"? Can ya pass me what you're smoking please? I love how your side assumes things. How do you know I didn't already hear the full clips and would still like to know? Context? She HAS NO context. She had to ask if she should stand and clap or not. Sheeple, bahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

@Alyssa_Milano @tedlieu His district has 8.6% unemployment while the rest of the nation is at 3.7%. Maybe he'd amazing if he did something for his constituents rather than spend his days  attacking our president. But, what do I know, I'm reading off script here...
@IlhanMN @AOC Imagine you were caught, family killed, transported across the sea somewhere in Central America. Then forced your way up north by a coyote, who may or may not rape you along the way. You're then sold to someone that bought you after you entered America illegally. Want a wall now?
@HainesForSF Maybe she and her cronies better stop funding them and/or buying their oil?
@donlemon 2 - So, you're hard hitting ?'s towards her justifies your total &amp; utter neglect to follow up ?'s or even tough ?'s to corrupt politicians or expose Big Pharma? You're no journalist, you're a puppet told to read a script &amp; give asinine opinions to stir your base. You're a joke.
@donlemon 1 - So? Just because she's aware doesn't negate the fact CNN's pattern of belittling America still stands.
@AP Wow, I thought once Kavanaugh got in, that'd be the end of abortions.
@RealJack She won't respond but says he's projecting. Just lied within that sentence. No one calls her out on this?
@Dawn_DeMore1 @V_actually @GenFlynn If I were Trump, I'd pardon him
@SenJeffMerkley Either there's a crisis at the border when you acknowledge these children, or there's not when you refuse to fund a wall. Which is it? Why isn't ANYONE talking about why there's so much turmoil in Central/South America causing these people to flee? No, just blame Trump as answers
@wuestyette @RWhisk1 @SpeakerPelosi Wow, so record unemployment across the field, higher wages, more manufacturing jobs isn't anything? Your blind hatred towards the man is disturbing to say the least.

@ericswalwell There's no real journalists today. If there are any, they certainly don't belong to ANY #MSM organization. Otherwise, if they did and were real journalists, they'd report on Big Pharma, corrupt politicians such as yourself. They're bought out to say scripts &amp; give opinions.

@SpiceyGirl512 @AalayahEastmond Reminds me of this testimony. https://t.co/n6s4JjEYnL Amazing how all the news stations were all set up to capture 100's of officers leading children out of classrooms yet still managed to miss shooter who they had eyes on the whole time. Imagine that.
@WalshFreedom Unless you're an immigrant living in a sanctuary city. Then all you have to do is get there and apply, the democrats will take care of the rest.
@RWhisk1 @SpeakerPelosi Exactly, Trump is giving them oversight, that's why they're after him so much
@SpeakerPelosi NOW you're all about the Constitution. Amazing.
@MichaelAvenatti @realDonaldTrump LMFAO you sir, are a laugh riot!!!! You have NO IDEA, or if you do are completely ignoring it, as to who he's going against. Take a seat, Short Stuff, and be thankful you're not in jail
@RepJayapal @HouseJudiciary Really, 100 people are killed each day? Oh please show citations on that statistic you pulled out of the air. I DARE you...
@AdamSchiff But voter ID's are still a no-no? Got it. You want votes to count, and count, and count, and count without accountability. Open borders, sanctuary cities/states are great voter supplies, no wonder you don't want a wall.
@SpeakerPelosi Shhh forget the human trafficking &amp; drug smuggling we indirectly support by not wanting a wall built, pay attention to this instead!!
@RepBonnie @SenatorMenendez No, let's NOT go after sex traffickers, drug dealers, pedophiles and rapists says the @FBI because we're the bitch of the Democrats and we bend over and do whatever they want us to do. GTFOH, anyone following these orders to investigate is making a mockery of the FBI. Shameful.
@IlhanMN @AOC @AyannaPressley @RashidaTlaib Newbie must be loving the kickbacks she's already getting. Yeah, no funding for the brave men &amp; women trying to remove violent gang members that entered illegally &amp; living comfortably in sanctuary cities/states such as Minneapolis. #FollowTheMoney
@tedlieu @MattWhitaker46 @HouseJudiciary LOL this is going to come back to bite you all in the ass!!! ALL of this could have been avoided if Obama gave the OK for the cyber team to go after Russia, but he allowed them. This cover up won't work, you will ALL be exposed &amp; #JusticeComing for ALL of you. Believe that.
@Ilhan Putting that jacket on didn't help your confidence w/ your delivery BC it was weak, low energy not well thought out &amp; showed yourself as a hypocrite by pawning the federal employees off as political leverage on your "attack". Miserable fail. Go back to the drawing board young one
@Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump When they only gave us a digital copy of it, which was faked, I think Trump nailed it going after Obama.
@mitchellvii @e3f3c53fc7ae44e @gatewaypundit My God these people are hellbent on taking down the man. If they spent a fraction of the time/energy going after ACTUAL criminals like pedophiles &amp; sex traffickers they might be worth while.
@KamalaHarris Here's the other 2 they gave us... https://t.co/6eZ5d1hU6I
@KamalaHarris I actually looked up the IP #'s our intelligence community gave to us saying they belonged to Russia. Did you? Doubtful. Interesting not ONE of the #'s turned up to be Russian.

@RepAdamSchiff If only someone had oversight to you and those on the committees you're on. Something's rotten in the state of Denmark...

@DonaldJTrumpJr Thank you, sir! I'm glad someone else picked up on her shaking her head at that and many other things! She's pure evil as is a lot of them.
@AOC @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi @tedlieu care to weigh in on this? Not a word? I figured as much. One last question; How much does it suck to be you right now listening to your handlers bitch &amp; freak out about their ivory towers crumbling? #JusticeComing https://t.co/sl0zzd3NY5
@RepDonBeyer The 800K workers is 0.0053% of the work force. Not a single Democrat has given credit to the man for revitalizing our economy and bringing in record low unemployment across the field. Pathetic to attack him for this. Shameful &amp; disrespectful to say the least.
@RepAdamSchiff You're 100% right, rooting out malfeasance is vital. I can't wait to see you on national TV getting arrested &amp; taken away by a dozen plus FBI agents. Don't think for one second that's not going to happen too. There's a new sheriff in town... Believe that #JusticeComing
@AOC I found it VERY unsettling seeing you &amp; the rest of the Democrats sitting on your hands as our president talked about the progress in human trafficking. In fact, your face looked angry @ the fact @ the great job he's doing w/ that. Your face showed your true feelings about lots.
@IlhanMN Gee, sorry he didn't go over it with you to see if he should include those or not, JUST for you!
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Your kickbacks must be huge for keeping CA a sanctuary state.
@RepDonBeyer So, to show him, you'll get the jump and start in on the rage against him? Start in on how bored he sounds and not take anything seriously just to show him? Talk about not truly showing any interest in unity or bipartisan deals to help our country... https://t.co/u7VOzkvJeC

@HomelandDems Your sole purpose is to keep Americans safe and when border agents are saying they need a wall, you ignore them. What do you do with all the money given to you? Help finance the smugglers? GTFOH
@IlhanMN Honest question then; What do you call justice?
@MikeLevinCA @realDonaldTrump Is it nice to see him talk about unity then automatically dismiss it as empty rhetoric? I think your the party that doesn't want unity, hating on the man constantly. It's really old. Ruth Bader Ginsberg old. Where is she?
@davidcicilline Are you talking? Don't you have an ounce of humanity in you? Or are you so full of disdain you lash out at our own president? Don't you have a district to run or something? Or are you, like all the democrats, too lazy to do something for YOUR CONSTITUENTS BC you have no plan?
@lsarsour Thank you, I needed a laugh! https://t.co/K6qkE2FiFt
@IlhanMN Example #1 as to why our country will never get to the full potential it can be with people like her in office. Nothing but hatred and contempt for our president. What's she done again? Your turn, lady.

@RepTedLieu @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump This man is constantly attacking our president to keep your eyes off his own record of unemployed in his own district. It's more than double the national average at 8.6% yet he can't stop criticizing our president to avoid doing his job for his constituents. Disgraceful, shameful
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump They also bypass 9 consulates in Mexico to apply for asylum to skip ahead of the line and into sanctuary cities/states on the American taxpayers expense.
@JackPosobiec Lucky for her, otherwise she'd have to stand and she'd likely fall over, drunk.
@SenSchumer He's done an INCREDIBLE job thus far. Our economy is adding far more jobs than expected AND wages are increasing. Imagine what he could do IF you Democrats started working WITH HIM instead of trying to take him down for blinking wrong... But WTF do I know, right, Chucky?

@RepAdamSchiff Not sure how/why you're still on the committees you're on, must pay off some important people. But regardless of that, the info you have far exceeds what anyone can find on Google, info like this https://t.co/vTzEKiFIBV showing you're a liar. Step down from your posts, sir.
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump The laws have been in place, w/ exception of few minor tweaks, since 1996. Where do YOU suggest we put the children while they're being processed?
@SebGorka Being a journalist means nothing IMHO. They chose a course in school, that's it. After graduating, all they do is read scripts given to them by The Powers That Be. IF they did something, they'd expose Big Pharma &amp; all the corruption in DC but they're bought out &amp; dare not do so.

It's buried deep in his core, the governor was and still is a racist. Evidence shows it, plain and simple and now he's trying to deny it after admitting it. https://t.co/4faxWj3YI2
@ABC7Chicago Yeah, he already admitted guilt for it. So him saying he wasn't in it now means nothing and is insulting

@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Dear Teddy R.: Way to keep ignoring your constituents! No wonder your approval rating is 19%. How on earth did you get re-elected?? Guess rigging it works, right? Either that or have illegals vote for you BC legal citizens of yours can't stand you, right? Reduce the unemployed!!!
@tedlieu So how about voter ID's so we ALL know who voted and for whom?
@RepTedDeutch The info you have on the committees that you're on, and how many ISIS attacks went on our soil? How many BILLIONS a year go into counter-terrorism? Weird you guys miss it all, ESPECIALLY the Trump attackers. You'd think you'd stop them. Unless you WANT them to happen? Why though?
@tedlieu you're up, Teddy R. Your district has more than DOUBLE the national unemployment rate at 8.6%, yet you're constantly at our president. Here's an idea, do YOUR job and let the president do his. Work for YOUR constituents instead of ignoring them as you attack Trump. https://t.co/IbpF1t6pwb

@SenSchumer Why are Democrats so opposed to voter ID's?
@SenatorMenendez In 1963 JFK and congress passed The Equal Pay Act. Enforce it maybe?
@AOC Google the Constitution please. Read it. Learn from it. THEN speak. Deal?
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Then what's your idea of making sure the children are really the children of the adults that bring them? What do you suggest we do with the ones that aren't their parents &amp; the kids that were kidnapped from their real parents? Let them all go through as they were coming in? Wow.
@JohnBrennan I hear you're about to be indicted. Have fun with that 🙂😆😅😂🤣😇
@HomelandDems @realDonaldTrump So, over 540,000 WEREN'T arrested at the border last year? And those are ONLY the ones that WERE caught. So please, tell us why you say it's fiction?
@KamalaHarris @JussieSmollett Where's the video footage? Why'd he leave the noose on until police showed?
@SenKamalaHarris There she goes again, appealing to her base, illegal immigrants. 100,000's per year are arrested @ our southern border &amp; those are the ones caught. Sanctuary cities/states harbor them and you want to count them? SMH
@tedlieu Who authorized going into Syria then?
@tedlieu Amazing yet you're bitching about him leaving Syria...

@RepAdamSchiff @RepDonBeyer The committees you're on, you'd def know if he colluded or not. You KNOW you have nothing, never did and never will. Otherwise, you'd have pulled the trigger by now.
@tictoc @tedlieu When your district has 8.6% unemployment, you HAVE TO attack the president to get your constituents off your own tails, right Teddy R.?
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump How many children are in your city, Chucky?
@wemophil I'm not sure how a man on so many important committees can get away with such things. Maybe that's why, BC he is on them? Shouldn't be that way though, should be held MORE accountable than ever having such responsibilities.
@wemophil Seeing as he's been in $100+ MILLION lawsuits, something as trivial as blocking people means nothing to him. We need him out of office for this
@tedlieu Wow. You truly showed your colors with this one. NOTHING is ever good enough for you or people like you. Sickening because you don't even see it.

@SenWarren Fear monger! You know what's crushing families? Illegal immigrants killing our citizens, getting billions a year off the avg. American. Subsidizing sanctuary cities/states costs us a fortune! Fund the wall!!!
@tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Mr. Lieu: Lower your unemployment rate which is at 8.6%, more than twice the 3.7% national avg. #InLieuOfWork
@KaitMarieox @Acosta It still has more, 26k to 25k now! Loving it
This is a lesson to all countries out there, do NOT let The Powers That Be dictate your lives! They want you ALL as working slaves!!! Stand up for EVERY RIGHT that you still have left!!! https://t.co/kIsqb6SXyN
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Much like you do daily, attacking our president with your district's unemployment at 8.6% when national avg. WHICH Trump brought to, is at 3.7%. So excuse him for spending the weekend "twiddling his thumbs", I think he's earned it, unlike you.
@tedlieu I'm sure the 8.6% unemployed in your district would LOVE seeing the hypocrisy dripping off you... if they could afford being online... https://t.co/AIuj5EQu1g

@RepScottPeters Weird, on your profile you say "country before party" &amp; "rule of law" yet the vast majority want a wall and you're so against them. Imagine that.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Here's an idea: Mr. Lieu try to lower the unemployment rate in your district instead of aimlessly attacking our president. It MIGHT actually make you look good. Because right now you seem like a bully that isn't getting his lunch money from a schoolyard kid.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Do YOUR job and help YOUR constituents. Especially the 8.6% that are unemployed, more than TWICE the national average. Stop acting like a moronic bully refusing to do homework that spends all his time picking on people that actually do theirs.
@SenJoniErnst I think you're violating @Twitter @TwitterGov promoting racist views. I take GREAT OFFENSE being called a white supremacist simply because I want a wall to be built. I want to protect EVERY American no matter their color from CRIMINALS coming through illegally. Understand diff???
@SenJoniErnst You didn't when @RepCohen compared Trump supporters to KKK, he took it down ASAP. What do you call minorities for Trump? I feel it's racist for people to automatically call a white person a white supremacist &amp; racist simply for having a difference of opinion.
#WalkAway #WalkAwayFromDemocrats #BuildTheWall I wish @POTUS would just arrest these congressmen for obstructing justice aiding and abetting criminals, money laundering through programs dealing w/ immigrants in sanctuary cities/states, anything &amp; everything he can, just do it. https://t.co/I5oZFwTSwt
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Dear Teddy R., can you fund the wall, something that deters criminals, vastly slows the rate of entry of criminals smuggling weapons, drugs and even humans. On behalf of Americans who live here and care about our families. Thank you.
#Democrats #DemocratsHateAmerica #DemocratsHateMinorities They want to claim ANYONE supporting the wall is a white nationalist/supremacist, completely disregarding ALL MINORITY VOICES that are FOR the wall being built. Imagine that. #BuildTheWall @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer
@SteveKingIA Since when is America strictly a white nation? Since when do you NOT listen to the voices of minorities that DO WANT the wall? Is it because they want the wall? They're minorities though, I thought all colors had a voice. As long as it's for Democrats. I see.
@MarkWarner You're the Vice Chairman on the Intel Committee and you say no to a wall? Interesting. Hey how much is your cut in all the trafficking? Asking for a friend... kinda broke right now... Lost her husband to an illegal immigrant murdering him... Walls work.
@AOC How about this, you're of Latin decent, right? You're being racist against me, a Native-American/Jew because you're lumping me as a white person. And since I have a difference of opinion I MUST BE a white supremacist in your eyes? Wow. Your mentality is astonishingly scary.

@RepSwalwell Don't you have constituents to take care of, or is THIS your job? To attack everything and anything our president does? Oh wait! I forgot! You also threaten law-abiding gun owners with nuclear retaliation if they don't give up their guns.

@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump While I appreciate your service it adds nothing to the conversation except an attempt by you to make yourself look good while @ the same time demeaning my opinion.

@SenTinaSmith @MSNBC @chrislhayes A complete waste of taxpayer $ is allowing illegals to continuously come into our country &amp; into sanctuary cities/states &amp; taking care of their needs.

@brianschatz When our country pays annually at least $116 BILLION on taking care of illegal aliens in sanctuary cities/states, that's more detrimental than the other. JMHO, prove me wrong. Not to mention a wall will help stop the flow of them back, reducing crime in those cities/states.

@MSNBC @chrislhayes Hello, Kettle, it's Pot, you're black. After the initial results for election night came back, Democrats only had picked up 23 seats.

@maybesomedia @FocusCheryl @DailyCaller @AmandaPresto They can apply to come to the country legally through them and choose not to do so. The independent media interviews I've seen, they all said they want a better life/job. Apply for a work visa at said consulates to legally enter the United States. Is that tough to understand?
@maybesomedia @FocusCheryl @DailyCaller @AmandaPresto Right because huge banks, hedge funds, Academy Award-winning, scientists, doctors, lawyers, congressmen, diplomats, and ambassadors all follow me because I know nothing and I'm totally biased.

@RepAdamSchiff What Trump did or owns in Russia prior to the election or now is of no concern since we do so much business with them as is. What property do you own? Is your name on the Panama Papers? I imagine it could be, knowing who you're married to. The FBI's investigating the wrong people

@justinjm1 People have been fleeing those countries for decades and getting the same treatment Trump's doing if they enter illegally. In some cases much worse. Yet NOW the left is so mad and it's solely Trump's fault. Reminder people, these storming the gates refused asylum in Mexico.
@BetoORourke These people have been fleeing for years before Trump got into office and nary a word from you or the left until he got into office. Imagine that! Also reliable sources on ground say about 80-90% are men. Their $ supply also stopped once they reached the border imagine that! SMDH

@maguidir @finner321 @LizNBntown @emeraldtyger @Breaking911 @anthonyfurey They weren't bombs. There was no explosive materials on any of the packages. You got to love the FBI letting CNN take pictures of an "active bomb" too BC that's so safe... https://t.co/ti4Z9wIguq
@CNN he should apologize to the woman on air. https://t.co/FW8lM08QYx
@Acosta @delaneytarr Someone take the shovel away from this man, please.
@Politics_PR It's a privilege, not a right to have a press pass. When Acosta laid his hand on that woman, that's when he crossed the line. Plain and simple.
@Acosta There's doing your job and even hogging the spotlight, sir. But, when you put your hands on a White House staffer the way you did in front of the world is totally unacceptable. You owe her an apology.
@RepTedDeutch @realDonaldTrump @Acosta pulled a White House staffer's arm down, blocking her. To the point he changed her balance and shifted her weight. All to take more shots at the president. He can't monopolize the time of the conference, sir. He got his ?'s &amp; was asked to stop, he didn't. Man's abusive
@RepAdamSchiff YOU should speak of serving the public's interest. Your district is in shambles, sir. Yet you have the nerve to attack your president?

@TheDemCoalition @realDonaldTrump Who took this picture, when, how'd the FBI get their hands on it so fast? Why show that at all since it's potentially evidence?

@BillyCorben @DavidCypkin @FBI So your co-producer just kept those pictures for this long, randomly? #FollowTheMoney lol Hey Corben, ever see the inside of a prison cell?
So who sent THIS picture so fast? Cause the FBI seemed to get their hands on it ASAP to show everyone. Yet this van is clearly on the road in traffic and they picked him up while he was parked. #MAGABomber #FalseFlagBombs #WakeUpAmerica ASAP!!! https://t.co/LYFagWemhy

@Anon2earth @realDonaldTrump I agree not everything is, but look at the history. As you said, do some research. Speak to people from the areas. Some things are as face value I will not object to that. But when your government says Oswald acted alone for 50 yrs then says different, it stands to ? more, right?

You people are putting words into his mouth. Tasteless.
@FilmGirl_24 Being president isn't about doing things personally but delegating authority, ideas, and systems to put in place to others that have the local power. Good managers work with what they got &amp; democrats aren't work w/ the man is all I'm saying. Neither did Republicans w/ Obama... so
@FilmGirl_24 Because all that is a recent occurrence with our society? Our way of life has been on the decline for decades LONG BEFORE Trump became president. I suggest instead of being sheep by blaming Trump, demand your democrat leaders to ACTUALLY DO MORE for you instead of incite violence

@FFZilla @PattyMurray I suppose all the other people he judged beforehand mean nothing? She had three and a half decades to come forward about this and did nothing. If ANYONE waited THIRTY-FIVE YEARS to do anything after the fact, they'd be laughed at and rightly so.

@AC360 Yeah, why rush something as important as that. She didn't rush to report this alleged raping, took 35 years! Also, if it affected her so greatly, it seems she did pretty well for herself. Wouldn't you agree? So why after all these years do YOU think she just NOW said something?JW
@JoelOsteen Is it in one of your mansions?
@SenFeinstein If this was so serious, why would the woman wait so long to come out? Thirty-five years is quite a long time, ma'am. Don't you agree?
@SenFeinstein Yeah, maybe they should wait 30+ to decide to come forward with their decision, right? Or does the accuser and the democratic party have dibs on waiting that long to come forward with something important?

@Queuedup1 For some reason members of #Anonymous, more likely #LULZ that became a part of ANON are against Trump and what he's doing. Denying the pedophile rings being exposed and exposing ICE agents addresses. They don't realize they're helping the problem &amp; if so hence, it's war. Be well.

@tedlieu @RepGoodlatte @FBI Uphold the Constitution from ALL enemies both foreign and DOMESTIC. You do realize top candidate are given secure info, not much, &amp; have to establish ties to other countries, right? Especially if they won the nomination. #ZeroCollusion
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Questions; Why is Russia so terrible considering the Cold War ended in 1991? You're acting as though THIS president should have NO CONTACT w/ them while others were since 1991, why? Shouldn't you work on your district instead of badmouthing the president?
@fenwic9 @PattyMurray There's no evidence of anyone on the Supreme Court nor Kavanaugh talking about or writing about "going backwards". All you're doing is believing the talking heads and parroting it. #WakeUp
@PattyMurray Why do you and your side keep thinking the Supreme Court is going to do that? You keep putting fear and resentment into people's minds by saying this when there's no evidence of them saying they will. What's in it for you to talk like this?
@GeorgeTakei If someone got permission to make a big mocking George Takei blimp and used it to promote something anti-homosexual you'd be all up and arms, right? But for some reason you're cool with mocking the president. A man who beat out 16 others AND Hillary w/o question. Did he hurt you?
@RepTedDeutch @realDonaldTrump So IC says Russia created this program which was actually created by @FireEye the company hired by IC. https://t.co/FbYbVxib0i IC also says these IP #'s were used by Russians (4 of 6) but NONE are in Russia. Do you research these things? https://t.co/NxsZGpRcuS
@PattyMurray There's been no indication the Supreme Court will ever "go backwards" other than your side saying so. And in doing so, is putting a negative view on Trump, again. Work with the man, do your job and quit obstructing IF you can, Patty.

@McFaul Weird, the man normalizes relations with Russia, you know since The Cold War ended 17 yrs ago &amp; you're after him. Why? NATO is still around why? Why are Germany &amp; France buying gas from Russia while America is helping pay for NATO? Legit questions, sir, do you have legit answers?
@TeamPelosi Why not question why members of NATO is buying natural gas from Russia and yet still claiming NATO is necessary?
@tedlieu Those who protest most about The Establishment being attacked by an outsider, is more than likely a big player in its corruption. Tell us more about your district and the kickbacks you get for it being a sanctuary city, sir. #FollowTheMoney #JusticeComing #PanamaPapers
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump The BIGGER PICTURE you should be questioning is why these people are fleeing those countries. Don't you think? Since 96 the laws have been in place &amp; rectified in 2016. 20 days 4 a trial isn't long. Takes longer 2 dispute a traffic ticket here. Courts are backed up. What do u do?
73 years &amp; 69 years since UN &amp; NATO were created. Cold War is over NATO still is around. Wars still are around &amp; so is world famine, it's as if these organizations aren't doing their jobs but want to get paid. World's superpower w/ most money can't solve world hunger, why? #UNPay
@tedlieu @POTUS How do YOU think it gets paid for, it being an alliance? Cause it seems just because you're in an alliance, all bills are null and void.

@charliekirk11 Quit making sense, sir. They don't want to hear any of that because THAT would infringe upon their freedom. Meanwhile there's laws for everything if you blink wrong AND it's a hate crime. Not to mention they want to take away our guns and First Amendment rights in order to do so.

@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump No, they put in extra aside from their own defense budget. In today's age, and with the UN, you'd think the BOTH of them would have eliminated what they set out to do, 70+ years ago. But let's keep pouring money into both! Great idea!
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump That argument makes no sense. NATO is an organization of countries that have come together to protect another. While IN NATO, they share responsibilities but it seems not same payments into it. Of course countries have their own defense budget, what's your point?
@lauren_hoggs So is that why your brother and the others are ignoring some very important questions that SHOULD BE asked? Such as was it a drill he was in? Because he mentioned 3 diff times he was at that "shooting". Just wondering cause you brought it up.
@JimKilbane There's hypocrites on both sides
@JimKilbane Talk about not accepting responsibility, prime example is BOTH the Clinton's. First Bill questioned the word IS and Hillary stood up for him. Then Hillary blames everyone but herself for losing, AGAIN. Remember she came in THIRD in 2008 lol
@WalshFreedom The US picked up the tab for WW2 AFTER saving Europe from the Nazis. For decades America's been paying far greater their share to help protect them in NATO too... Europe should be grateful for America at all.
@MalcolmNance What do YOU call it when Germany is so afraid of Russia but just made a natural gas deal with them to supply up to 70% of their natural gas from Russia? What do you call that when they say they're afraid of Russia to pay for their protection and then does that? JW

@SenGillibrand Nothing about the millions of homeless children in our country? Nothing about millions living in poverty here? Nothing about the millions of children whose parents are in jail for non-violent crimes? But these 3,000 you're in concern for? Priorities, maam.

@TheDrDrama @Robert_Fiore @jim_chu @AriMelberFans @DavidA949 @mitchellreports It'd seem to me the faster we focus on why they're fleeing, we can solve them coming here
@TheDrDrama @Robert_Fiore @jim_chu @AriMelberFans @DavidA949 @mitchellreports MSM hasn't touched the reasons why they're fleeing. I haven't seen any coverage.
@TheDrDrama @Robert_Fiore @jim_chu @AriMelberFans @DavidA949 @mitchellreports Agreed, obviously. However the real issues are what's going on in those countries MSM isn't talking about? Why are they fleeing there?
@TheDrDrama @Robert_Fiore @jim_chu @AriMelberFans @DavidA949 @mitchellreports Again, the data is inconclusive and it doesn't mention other countries. Also, no one on the left has come up with a solution of their own other than catch and release...

@TheDrDrama @Robert_Fiore @jim_chu @AriMelberFans @DavidA949 @mitchellreports He did and who knows how many were let in. AND, simply because they were deported, doesn't mean they didn't come back with other children to smuggle in
@TheDrDrama @Robert_Fiore @jim_chu @AriMelberFans @DavidA949 @mitchellreports How can you be certain it didn't happen at this rate? It was probably going on a lot more since he let countless in. Remember Kahn letting in thousands via his visa program and not checking them? The policy that's on today, as far as I know, was finalized in 2016 under Obama
@Robert_Fiore @TheDrDrama @jim_chu @AriMelberFans @DavidA949 @mitchellreports They don't have an answer for that one.
@TheDrDrama @Robert_Fiore @jim_chu @AriMelberFans @DavidA949 @mitchellreports No answers at all, just saying it's inhumane. Well yeah, obviously. But again, how do YOU suggest these children are dealt with and where they go?
@TheDrDrama @Robert_Fiore @jim_chu @AriMelberFans @DavidA949 @mitchellreports Where do you suppose the people that ARE trafficking children and aren't their parent, go? What do you do with the children then? Do you think these things out before you get outraged? Or just operate on emotion?
