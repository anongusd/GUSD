Eight years later all of that has changed. And eight years later, I'm a guest of honor at that very same comics show where I pitched my idea for a graphic novel over the table.		Hope to see y'all this weekend.		https://t.co/gqsJAs1904
I'd spent the last few years on Congressman Lewis' staff watching young people pass him by, not knowing who he was or what he represented.
Having been rejected by publishers nearly everywhere, I was excited and nervous and had nary a dollar to my name, but I felt so deeply that March would be important, necessary, and successful that I could not be deterred--I would not stop until it found a home.
Eight years ago this week, I packed my tattered bag from college and took a bolt bus to NYC to try and pitch a comics publisher over the table at @MoCCAFestNYC about this idea I had for a graphic novel called March.

What happens then? Will there be a rousing defense of prose and they will be given their own special lists b/c they can‚Äôt compete with the sales numbers of comics? @repjohnlewis teaches us to consider the long arc of history, and we might be surprised to see where it takes us.
I have no doubt that, b/c of the Internet and the growing generations of digital natives, sequential storytelling is the future. And one day, we‚Äôre going to take more spots on the other lists‚Äîjust as @MARCHTrilogy made the nonfiction list for both the Times and the Post
I worry about the other writers and artists whose joy has been stolen. What great work might we miss b/c they feel less joy?
I know there is a lot more to it, and a lot of business reasons behind the decision, but what makes me saddest is that a man who deserves joy--who earned joy‚Äîhas less joy in his life now.
Because of the decision to end the graphic novel bestseller lists, joy has been taken away from @repjohnlewis
After that, around noon each Friday, he would quietly ask, ‚ÄúIs it out yet?‚Äù For nearly three years, more often than not, I got to tell him that, once more, he was a NYT bestselling author that week. And it gave him joy.
This wasn‚Äôt just a tear, he full body ugly-cried, then hugged me and b/c he had been doing an interview he put his entire wet makeup covered face on my white shirt where an impression of his face remained the rest of the day.
Before March, @repjohnlewis had written two books, neither of which ever reached the NYT bestseller lists. When MARCH: Book One debuted at #1, he was so happy he cried.
After Book One of @MarchTrilogy was released, @repjohnlewis and I developed a Friday ritual that became, in the face of some very dark times, one of the things we looked forward to most: waiting for the NYT bestseller lists to come out.
Congress is a tough place to work, both as a Member and as a staffer.

@LibrarySpider @VaGentlenerd A few of us tried, myself included. It could be that we're wrong, or some other reason we just don't understand.
@LibrarySpider @VaGentlenerd The artist (or artists) likely came from the studio of one of Al Capp's brothers, most likely Eliott Caplin though it could have been another brother too. No credits were printed in the comic, and likely doing such work was not something one advertised at the time.
@negrosubversive Interestingly, the cover was changed before publication. Dr. King was supposed to look directly at the reader, but was changed to looking off to the side so it was less threatening.
@fredvanlente @VaGentlenerd @Brennanator @GCDcomics Nyack is where the Fellowship of Reconciliation is based. FOR published the comic. Also worth noting, the comic was funded by a grant from an organization called the "Fund for the Republic" which was underwritten by the @FordFoundation
@VaGentlenerd I have a theory that Eddie Campbell helped me develop but without documentation or verification from the artists it's all speculation. Others have tried too but nothing can proven conclusively. If someone can track down Sy Barry we could at least rule out some people.
60 years ago this week, the first copies of "Martin Luther King &amp; The Montgomery Story" were distributed.

Sec 3407 repeals credit for expenditures to provide access to disabled individuals.
Sec 3402 repeals employer-provided child care credit - this mean-spirited section only saves $20 million a year.
Ha, didn't expect this one: Sec 3305 repeals deduction for lobbying expenses... but it doesn't include federal lobbying.
Sec 3001 - Reduction in Corporate Tax Rate -- costing an estimated $1.46 TRILLION over ten years.
Sec 2001 repeals the Alternative Minimum Tax -- costing a staggering $695 BILLION over ten years.
Sec 1404 raises taxes on work-related child care / "dependent care assistance programs"
Sec 1406 raises taxes on adoption assistance services.

@hr609 Too much for tweets here. I suggest writing to the office. 343 CHOB Washington, D.C. 20515
@leffjakin Still, it's a thought. So much more story after Aug 1965.
@hr609 If that's the case, it's because the activists aren't doing enough to build their coalition and make that position mainstream.
@leffjakin @Nate_Powell_Art @repjohnlewis Maybe something like that, but we'll have to see.
@hr609 I can't speak for Congressman Lewis, &amp; I think you're engaged enough to know that, but keep speaking up &amp; build a broad coalition.
@hr609 Here are the cosponsors: https://t.co/b0CMbhXSmU
@hr609 No, he hasn't cosponsored the bill so he has not endorsed it. I can't speculate on what it will look like if it comes to the floor.
@hr609 He's in support of action. That's why they are asking for background checks first and foremost.
@hr609 I don't disagree. It's a GOP bill, but if we show we will meet them half-way and they still do nothing, we show their true position.
I respect this position. My father was muslim. I agree we need to do more to improve lists. But we have to protest. https://t.co/VU8aDWpjzg
