@avajennette Absolutely, I momentarily forgot Meadows existed. It was a happy moment.
Paul Gosar is the worst member of the House.		Except Steve King.		And Matt Gaetz. 		And Duncan Hunter.		God, how sad is it that the man who peddles Charlottesville false flag conspiracy theories barely cracks the bottom five
@howardfineman @greenbookmovie Like Driving MIss Daisy, Green Book was a pretty safe pick that I thought was fine, but didn't contribute much to the conversation beyond "RACISM BAD." I would have preferred BlacKkKlansman won. I'm not really up in arms about it though. What kind of Democrat am I? (2/2)
@howardfineman @greenbookmovie I thought 2018 was a pretty weak year for movies in general. Reminds me of 1989 a LOT, where adequately-made, okayish Driving Miss Daisy won over Spike Lee's Do The RIght Thing (which I consider the best race relations movie ever made and which wasn't even nominated). (1/2)

@RL_Miller Spoken like a typical California "progressive" who spends more time administering purity tests over Twitter to would-be representatives in Trump+31 districts than she does coming up with actual arguments to back up her hot Twitter take :)
@RL_Miller @SherrodBrown Can someone please point me to when Ojeda claimed to be the "future" of the left? It seems to me like that narrative was entirely created by Twitter hot takes. All I saw was a man attempting to run a populist race in literally one of the most conservative parts of the country.

@DFray32 @shaunking ❤
@shaunking There were people there who survived the Vegas shooting last year, including some friends of mine.		These people have experienced two mass shootings before the age of 25. Let that sink in.
Not that it should even fucking matter but the person who shot up my hometown was a white guy, NOT Middle Eastern as previously reported. Unless you're advocating for responsible gun contro legislature, take your hot Twitter take and shove it.
