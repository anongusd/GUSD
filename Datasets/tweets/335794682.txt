Once a single faculty of your soul has been tyrannized, all the other  faculties will submit to the same fate. This has been the cause of all  the religious crimes that have flooded the earth." - Voltaire
If you do not use the intelligence with which God endowed your mind to  resist believing impossibilities, you will not be able to use the sense of injustice which God planted in your heart to resist a command to do evil.
Nothing could be more convincing. Certainly any one who has the power to make you believe absurdities has the power to make you commit injustices.
In days gone by, there were people who said to us: "You believe in  incomprehensible, contradictory and impossible things because we have  commanded you to; now then, commit unjust acts because we likewise order  you to do so."
"Once your faith... persuades you to believe what your intelligence  declares to be absurd, beware lest you likewise sacrifice your reason in  the conduct of your life.

@cher I think we all know exactly what you mean. üòÄ Which books/authors are you listening to? Also, yes, you should write/narrate one!
@KatyTurNBC Also, there's an obsession on Fox News and every local TV network with petty crime. Even though crime has plummeted, especially in cities like NY, the constant coverage of mundane petty crime makes people think crime has actually increased.
@KatyTurNBC I remember those PSA's in the '90s every night: "It's 10pm. Do you know where your children are?" Not to mention all of those DARE and abduction programs that made us paranoid towards any adult-stranger, ice cream truck and Halloween candy.
Between the drone camera, bit rate, flash card/storage quality, video compression and re-compression online, I imagine there are a lot of potential bottlenecks.
Why does #drone footage almost always look like garbage?

I'm really glad I'm off #Viibryd now. I don't feel compelled to eat everything around me in mass quantities (as much) anymore. Yay!
The fat kid in me was hoping there'd be dough nuts today, but I'll settle for Girl Scout cookies.
Can everyone please stop taking videos with the phone in portrait mode? #GrindsMyGears
Oh thank glob today is payday. Technically it's tomorrow, but I usually get my fund$ deposited the day/night before.
@catieleary Lol, I just made it up but I wouldn't be surprised... My point is CNN thinks everything is "breaking news."
CNN Breaking News: Missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 still missing. OMG! Why is everything breaking news?
I've been experimenting talking in vocal fry &amp; what's funny is that people will start doing it in return, albeit unwittingly. #LOL
I'm really liking the new @TR_ST album. Where was I when this came out? Why did nobody tell me?
I wish I knew why I've been feeling butterflies in my stomach today. Am I supposed to be looking forward to something?
Is #goth / #emo still a thing? Or is every teen just obsessed with #EDM now? Is every subculture temporary?
I should probably distance myself from people who make me feel #misanthropic.
There was a fly buzzing around me, and when I looked around, I saw it had landed in my cup of coffee. Really?
I really think @democracynow should be required viewing/listening.@AmyGoodman_DN and her team are my heroes.
I tried making a #draggedout track, but it sounded worse after exporting. I think I know what I needed to have done. Too many peaks.
I just remembered this date once: Very family oriented, said they were OK-ish w him being gay, as long as his partner was white. So bizarre.
I swear, everything @AMTRAC produces is addictive as can be. Keep doing what you're doing, Caleb.
I wish I could remember everything I've ever learned.
I'm worried I'm going to die in a shooting massacre. After having worked so hard to get where I am. Ugh. White people and your guns... Smh.
"Instead of seeing my life flash before my eyes, I saw all of my old profile pictures."
@sidittyblkgirl Does that make sense? Like, some people are so eager to conceal their identities whenever it benefits them.
I'm trying to keep in mind that I can't always expect solidarity.
I wish @nodoubt had made a less offensive video for "Looking Hot." That's totally my anthem today. #fierce
"Oh we said our dreams will carry us, and if they don't fly, we will run." - @Santigold #sigh
RIP @DrMayaAngelou.

It's that time of year when everything feels warm and damp.
Controlled enrollments. Easier said than done. Omg.
I spent ~3 hours in the car today so I could drive up to where my orthodontist is (Dalton, GA). I think I deserve a drink now.
There's nothing quite like the feeling of having a drill used on your mouth.
I had an emergency dental situation today. My lower retainer came unglued, and the ortho. had to rebond it.
The song "Sad Eyes" by @CRYSTALCASTLESS always reminds me of the Boston bombing, prob bc I was listening to a lot of III at that time.
So I'm leaving work early to get my permanent retainer glued back on. I really hope they don't charge me for it. It wasn't my fault...
I watched entire Angels in America miniseries (by HBO) this weekend. Made me realize that #solidarity can't always be expected.
So one side of my permanent retainer came undone. Am I supposed to wait until tomorrow to call my orthodontist...? Is this serious...?
Twitter emailed me to let me know that 9 people had read my tweets.
This weekend sucks. I've already been stood up twice... Someone remind me who my friends are?
I never tht there'd be a song by @MIAuniverse that gives me the feels but I just realized that Come Walk w Me reminds me too much of my ex.
Everyone (*especially* white people) should probably read this: http://t.co/PdFTQEd3LB
Correction: I DID just experience a racist micro-aggression bc what matters is that I'm hurt. *sigh*
I think I just experienced a racist micro-aggression?
I love @pitchforkmedia reviews. When ppl ask me what i listen to, I'm going to say I listen to trippy white noise and paranoid synth-pop.
I had the weirdest dreams last night (alien princesses, strangers in my bed, etc.) Not sure if it was the hookah, alcohol, or Viibryd.
I can't wait to get some extended Zzz over the 3-day weekend. "School's Out" by Alice Cooper is so apropos right now.
My dept at work likes to compare ourselves w competing private companies. Needless to say, we're doing a lot better than the competition.
@TessaGreenleaf OMG! OMG! OMG! You know the quickest way to my heart is with free stuff/swag.		(lol/jk)
I'm trying to find a quote from the #Buddha, something like 'Comparison is the root of all suffering.' Does any1 know what I'm talking ab?
I was planning on dying my hair black again but I think I'll leave the bleached hair. I might touch it up with some streaks of blue again.
@TessaGreenleaf Nice! Be sure to bring back some swag. ;-)
@sidittyblkgirl Girl, let's take a trip to New York together! We can stay in a hostel and save $$$.
I love food truck days. Today it was @texstacos, which makes great tacos.
I'm really tired of my mouth tasting like medicine and mucus. OMG. Gross. I also never learned to spit, so...
I really recommend everyone listen to/watch @democracynow each day. If not the whole thing, then at least the headlines.
Elliott Smith speaks to me in ways that no other artist can. *sigh* RIP.
@h3dg3Wytch Ooh, this would be great for creating panoramic vistas en masse, especially of interior spaces for virtual tours.
I feel like every pencil sharpener I encounter explodes immediately on contact. OMG. Pencil shavings everywhere.
Somehow eating sounds like a more challenging task to accomplish while driving than drinking? But I think she meant alcohol.
I just overheard my boss say to someone over the phone: You can eat and drive, not drink and drive!
Warm water makes the drowning feeling go away.
I'm so proud of myself for finally using my neti pot successfully last night. I think what I was doing wrong was using cold water.
I can't focus on my work bc I'm thinking about counseling later and then Taco Tuesday dinner.
I probably shouldn't sing along to Iggy Azalea at work...
It's sometimes really hard to keep yourself from thinking: I'm going to die alone.
Could I date someone who lives an hour away?
I really need to learn how to use my neti pot. I just need to get over the whole water-in-nose thing.
Welp. I tried to make it through work today, but I was too cough-y and sniffly for anyone's good. Now I'm just relaxing at home.
And why do I watch these shows to judge for myself...? My identity is blurring through the pixelated screen of the simulacrum.
And then my ex said that I'm just like Patrick from HBO's Looking. Why does everyone think I'm some awful white person?
My roommate once said that I'm just like @lenadunham, and I disagreed at first, but now I see a lot of myself in her, or vice versa.
The only thing getting me through this cold is watching Girls in my PJs.
"Without examples, without models, I began to believe voices in my head." Ooh. That really resonates with me.
When did 2014 become (almost) halfway over...?
All I wanna do is dance along to Beyonc√© with my friends. Who gets sick during the summer?
There's really no limit to the kinds of questions that are asked&amp;answered on the Internet.
I made it through the day today. I *really* hope I don't get anyone at work sick. I stayed away from everyone. Sanitized all my things.
I blew my nose, and a blood clot came out. OMG! This obviously means I have cancer.
I can't wait for this cold to go away. Ugh. At least it's Friday. I'm tired of my face oozing liquids.
Although, everywhere I go now, I feel like I keep running into people with green, pink, etc. hair. We're so cool.
I'm getting so many compliments on my blue/lilac/lavender hair. I kind of wish it would last forever. http://t.co/edf4A0BGJX
So here's the blue hair. !!! http://t.co/sEbevBCnv8
OMG! I'm finally doing it, guys. I'm dying my hair blue-ish for #shakykneesfest. :O I'm having to bleach it first.
I'm eating an apple, and I just bit my lip. There's blood on my apple now, but I think I'm going to eat it anyway.
@Deswhite6 This'll prob be the hilight of my summer. Some bands that r playing, I've listened to since I was a teen. Chance of a lifetime.
@Deswhite6 I'm a little bummed that I'm going to have to miss it. :P But then again, Shaky Knees! :D
Music has a way of sending me back in time and making me re-experience emotions from *years* ago. *sigh* I guess that's nostalgia.
Today's the last day of work for me this week. I can't wait till #shakykneesfest ! OMG!
@sidittyblkgirl IKR? Their priorities r way out of whack. U'd think their concerns wd lie w transit, safety, gentrification &amp; preservation
