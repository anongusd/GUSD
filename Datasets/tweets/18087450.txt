A person that does not value your time will not value your advice. #C4projectRocks
The cause of waves of unemployment is not capitalism but governments denying enterprise the right to produce good money. - Von Hayek #C4Project
What?!? LIFE has doubled its sponsoring in the last month in anticipation of the launch of C-4 Project. That’s it, I’m going to show the plan! 😂 https://t.co/66kFgfJuN9
Can you hear the LIFE train coming? Every key indicator up in November led by sponsoring up over 100% from October! We are doubling our numbers! So proud of you all. #C4ProjectROCKS
I don’t believe we shall ever have a good money again before we take the thing out of the hands of government – that is, we can’t take them violently out of the hands of government, all we can do is by some sly roundabout way introduce something that they can’t stop. - Von Hayek
While boasting of our noble deeds, we are careful to control the ugly fact that by an iniquitous money system, we have nationalized a system of oppression which, though more refined, is not less cruel than the old system of chattel slavery. - Horace Greeley #EndFinancialMatrix
Multisided platforms face another huge hurdle that is related to the coordination problem. They don't just need some customers from all sides to show up. They need enough for it to matter, for w/o this, a matchmaker is offering a lousy product. #C4MatchMakers
I am more convinced than ever that if we are ever again going to have a decent money, it will not come from government. - Nobel Prize winner F.A. Hayek #C4Project
The great trouble is that money wasn’t allowed to develop. After several hundred years of the use of coins, the State stopped further development. We were not allowed to experiment on it, so money hasn’t improved, it has rather become worse. - F.A. Hayek #2019C4Project
It’s fooloshly naive to believe centralized power-hungry State bureaucrats with Napoleon complexes will protect us from decentralized power-hungry business people with Napoleon complexes, for when they join forces they both win at masses expense. #FreeMarkets
Innovators speak truth to power to create change; hence, why freedom to think and do is so vital for society’s success. #FinancialFreedom
Chris and I received more comments from this webinar than any other webinar we have ever done. https://t.co/zuFElzp9Kz
This is SHOCKING! In 2008, the Financial Matrix siphoned off $3.29 Trillion in loan interest while only paying out $178.6 Billion in interest for customer deposits. That’s a 1842% ROI! Fiat money and FRB banking is robbing the people’s wealth. #EndFinancialMatrix
Innovation drives economic growth and the C-4 Project is true innovation. So much to be thankful for and I hope everyone has a Happy Thanksgiving! #EndFinancialMatrix

The people are so unalterably on the side of sound money that it is a serious question how they would regard the system under which they live, if they once knew what the initiated (Financial Matrix) can do with it.” - Henry Ford (My Life and Work, p. 179)
When it comes to money, what I am interested in is the most decentralized, censorship resistant store of value and subsequent opportunity for medium of exchange that will form the basis for value measure and transfer in the future. - Aleksandr Svetsky
