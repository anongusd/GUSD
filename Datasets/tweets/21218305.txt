@Jason15998520 @cainwtp @Drew_Hammill They were only getting a paycheck still because they had worked previous weeks that hadn't been paid out yet. Any work they were doing during the time he was in Iraq (during the shutdown) they were not paid for.
@mercernole @CraigAToma @cainwtp @Drew_Hammill They're definitely different roles, I have no qualms with that statement. But the house Intelligence Committee was made to oversee the entire intelligence community. Including those overseas. And the Foreign Affairs Committee has everything to do with being in other countries.
@mercernole @CraigAToma @cainwtp @Drew_Hammill Just because they aren't in command of the Armed Forces doesn't mean they don't have jobs pertaining to the Armed Forces. If neither side is willing to give an inch (which both sides are at fault for) I have no problem with elected officials doing things they are elected to do.
@cwrightid @CraigAToma @cainwtp @Drew_Hammill That question is irrelevant to this discussion, but yes she is. I disagree with elected officials getting paid during shutdowns, but I don't see any of them turning it down.
@CraigAToma @cainwtp @Drew_Hammill And yet Pelosi wasn't the only one going. The chairman of the Intelligence Committee and the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee were also going. But, I guess you're right, Trump is the only one who gets to do their job.

@1410Kinner I have the exact opposite thoughts on Marvin being around next year. To me this feels like Mike Brown saying, you have the remainder of this season to fix it or your gone. And Hue represents the last chance effort for Marvin to salvage it.
The shooting death of #JemelRoberson proves one thing. You can't be black and a 'good guy with a gun' at the same time. Because one of those is a suitable offense to be shot by police officers despite doing nothing wrong.

@_PYTLIK @PGSittenfeld The Supreme Court races weren't marked R and D on the ballot. So my theory is that only the people who showed up to the polls truly educated on the races knew which candidate represented which party and that's why Dems won those races vs the 'marked' R vs D races.

@KevinMcCune I know you didn't. And we lose because we are a team devoid of our two stars and are made up of Al Horford, some kids, and role players. Most of whom thrive on momentum and a loud home crowd behind them.
@KevinMcCune My only beef with the refs this series at all was it seemed like in a must win game 4 in Cleveland, the refs made sure Morris (who's been the best LeBron defender in the series) got in foul trouble early. (I've been convinced the NBA is rigged for about a decade now)
@KevinMcCune After every game it's funny the reaction I see though. When the Celtics lose, a bunch of people on my Celtics Facebook pages blame the refs. When the Cavs lose a bunch of my real life friends blame the refs. They are clearly a fun group to blame right now.
@KevinMcCune My argument is that shouldn't have been called. It's not a phantom call. But it shouldn't have been called. Just like a lot of other fouls in this series shouldn't have been called.
@WillCainShow @willcain That scarf would look great in my rotation with all my soccer scarves.
@KevinMcCune This series has more calls than I'd like to see period. During the regular season most of these wouldn't get called. Basketball can be a little bit physical. Especially when someones attacking the lane. It seems like if someone drives the lane right now a foul is imminent.
@KevinMcCune I've watched this play a lot the past couple days. It's a soft call. Super soft. But at 34 second JRs ring finger (and maybe pinkie) graze the elbow. Super soft. Super super soft. But still contact.
@KevinMcCune In fairness though, every game of this series the refs have had some incredibly considerate calls in favor of the home team. I expect nothing different on Friday in Cleveland.

@SuhhAm What about work boots?
Chuck Norris wears Terry Rozier pajamas to bed at night.
NBA is rigged. With a minute left in regulation Kevin Love got an offensive rebound and didn't have room to move. So he started swinging his elbows and caught DeRozan in the face. That should be a flagrant foul, two free throws, and possession.
Going to bed with sweet dreams of @T_Rozzay3 dropping 3's dancing through my head.

@ASportsGallery I have a kinda weird item that I'm curious if it has any value. It's a binder full of the whole 1990 regular season show scipts and handwritten notes by Yid for "This Week In Reds Baseball". I think it's one of a kind given that the notes appear to be in pen.
@1410Kinner you aren't saying that Billy Hamilton isn't some stellar player but you're saying that if the basis of a good player is they play both ways, then Hamilton has a hole in his game and Winker has a hole in his as well.
@KevinMcCune Maybe their play gets elevated (or masked) by the better play of the rest of the line?
@KevinMcCune After you tweeted that I looked at the draft board and said, "the Lions will take Crosby." And look what happened. Twice in one draft the lions take the player I want.
@KevinMcCune In the fifth round, I'd take at least a flier on him. This dude we just picked is the 44th ranked cb in the class. They gave him an overall grade of a 30! I haven't seen many grades even in the 50s and we take a 30. Oof.
@KevinMcCune Or not.
@KevinMcCune Take the value pick of Crosby here!
@KevinMcCune I knew we weren't going to address tackle properly. Willams could've been ours in the 2nd and Orlando Brown could've been ours in the 3rd. Passing on both of them indicated to me that tackle wasn't a priority.
@MGolicJR57 @espngolic maybe Shazier walking out will be a visual warning to players not to lead with the crown of your helmet.
I wonder if the @USNavy would let @johnfr98 out of boot camp for three hours so I didn't have to go through this Game 7 alone. @NHLBruins

@kyle_patton Here's the thing. I wasn't even all that upset with it when it happened. I figured he would be a fine or suspension and he also got flagged. It was after I got on here and saw people praising him for it.
@kyle_patton I can have beef with it if I also have beef with my guys doing it. I yell at them for doing stupid stuff like that all the time.
@kyle_patton As it should be. They are getting suspended for their hits, which were similar hits. The beef with Juju is the hit followed by the taunting.
@kyle_patton Same happened with the Davante Adams hit a few weeks back. If he doesn't get taken off in a stretcher, there isn't near the outrage.
@kyle_patton It was also a bad hit and he will be deservedly suspended or fined. The main difference in my eyes is George didn't stand over Brown after the hit. Optics wise, tez leaving on a stretcher vs Brown getting up and dancing will add to more outrage as well.
RT @WhoDeyFans: JuJu said he didn’t mean to stand over Burfict and taunt… yeah, looked accidental to me.
@warwick_robin @steelersfrenzy @DCRezz @JFowlerESPN I believe at that point in time there was only one late hit on Ben in the game and it wasn't a hit it was Geno Atkins pushing Ben to the ground.
@steelersfrenzy @DCRezz @JFowlerESPN Yeah, but that's just karma for ya. 🤷
@steelersfrenzy @DCRezz @JFowlerESPN So now that Juju has done a bad thing that means he can expect karma to pay it back then.
@steelersfrenzy @DCRezz @JFowlerESPN It actually looks like he was comparing the Gio injury to the Shazier injury and that Brown was thus comparing Juju to Tez.
@kyle_patton @MarcSesslerNFL I actually have a problem with it in any instance. If someone holds and someone else chop blocks, why doesn't only one get enforced?		Two personal fouls just seems like of there were to be an exception, it'd be that.

@kyle_patton but for some reason football feels likes like a fluke and more decisive after one game than basketball.
@kyle_patton correction. I like it. It's fun. But it does a bad job at crowning the best team in the country as the National Champs.
@kyle_patton I still maintain that I don't like the ncaa tournament. It's too fluky for my liking.
@kyle_patton well that explains some of the angrier tweets I've read. Don't worry. 90% of them come back pissed and win it all next year.
@kyle_patton replay rules? What did I miss? I was driving home during the game and didn't see any of it outside of the last like three mins.
@kyle_patton this is why this format is flawed. UK is hands down the best team in the country and doesn't get to play in a NC game. Silly.

@WhoDeyFans @ScottBantel @nickseuberling @CJAnthonyCUI that's fair. The pick (almost) six didn't help point total. Lots of long drives tho.
@nickseuberling @WhoDeyFans @CJAnthonyCUI @ScottBantel blame being placed on Nugent but I would like point to Andre Smith pen on 2nd Hill td
