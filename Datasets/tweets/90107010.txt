@King_Of_Shade @kurteichenwald @annmariechez Good question.  Since most religious organizations engage in politics these days, I‚Äôm sure we need to look into rules and regs that enable them to dodge taxes.  Separate Church and State.
@Buddhist66 @cdelbrocco @kurteichenwald I sure don‚Äôt trust the school to reprimand ‚Äòem as they say they will.  We‚Äôre living in a time when public admonition on say Facebook might better get their attention.
@ProudResister Ditto Ryan.  Thanks for all you do.
