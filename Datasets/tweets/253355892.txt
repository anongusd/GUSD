@Eddie_and_Patti @marklutchman It is.
@JayKliever @marklutchman Fair point. Trump reminds me of Ronald Reagan in several ways. To give Reagan credit, he had some political experience as a former governor before being elected to the Presidency, whre as Trump had none, thought that would be a disadvantage.

@DevilDawgRob @DoingRight1 @POTUS A fair point.
@DevilDawgRob @DoingRight1 @POTUS I agree with him on how the media mistreats him, however, I oppose his use of that particular phrase.
@DevilDawgRob @DoingRight1 Thanks. IMHO, Trump's use of the phrase 'enemy of the people' is a foolish term to use, given how many dictators have used it in the past to justify their actions. Trump's no Stalin or other dictator, mind you, but, I find the use of that phrase by an American President foolish.
@DevilDawgRob @DoingRight1 IMHO? Not sure what that stands for. Most can be civil, like me, for instance. That, and I often may disagree with the President over a policy, only because I think it sounds silly, or because I haven't heard of it everbeing used before, and I may be confused about it.

@leanneaguilera Hisses to Veronica for accusing Archie of shooting Hiram, making them break up, again. I'm sick of them breaking up and getting back again. Why can't the writer's just let them be? Also, kisses to FP and Hermione for undermining Hiram's plans from the shadows.
@ArchieComics Cool. No clue who the actress is though. Should be interesting.
@CW_Riverdale Great ep, though, I didn't care for Ronnie breaking up with Archie, accusing him of shooting Hiram. Quit putting them through the God damn ringer!. Let. Them. Be!.

@BrianEPaterson @CW_Riverdale Not bad, but, Ronnie was a fool. Breaking up with Archie, again!. Get them together, and stop this!.
@RiverdaleDark Great ep, but, ugh, Ronnie, you broke up with Archie, again? Stop it!. Come to your senses!.
@BrianEPaterson Great ep, but, stop breaking up Archie and Ronnie!.
@RealMattCouch Yeah. Many think both he, and the speaker are acting like spoiled children.

@RealJamesWoods @JennJennMarie The comparison is terrible, but, still, this sort of thing at a baseball game? Yeesh!.
@realDonaldTrump @jihadwatchRS True, but, you should take your own advice, Mr. President.
@ScottPresler Good man. Regardless of political views, no one should be threatened into silence.
@GeraldoRivera Maybe not Russian, but, it may be someone's idea of a sick joke.
@lisa_hiser Fan theory on Edgar of Riverdale. He may be the Gargoyle King, using that as an alias to add new members to his cult. Also, Hiram is being so damn disrespectful. He should let her run her business her way, without him sticking his mafia nose in it.

@MarkConsuelos Love your acting dude, but, ugh, your character's getting on my nerves. He should let her be, and own up to framing Archie. Hermione and Veronica will be his undoing, I have no doubt, and his obsession. He shows his own daughter such disrespect.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Fair point, but, your father also has to take responcibility
@CW_Riverdale Hiram must be the one destroyed. Hopeing Veronica and Hiram work together to make it happen, with people they can trust. Hope Archie is set free.
@ScottPresler Good God. Both sides are being targeted with threats. Glad your case is being taken seriously, as are the cases of threats against CNN and others. Not a fan of CNN or Democrats, but, I wish for no one's death or injury.
@realDonaldTrump I may support many of your ideas, but, your campaign rhetoric may be part of the issue with these bomb threats. It's possible a supporter of yours has taken your words against the press and Democrats to be law. Think about that, sir.
@leanneaguilera Hisses and kisses from me. Hisses to Hiram, for still wanting to cause trouble for Veronica. Hisses to Veronica for accepting that painting, has to have hidden mics in it or something. Hisses to Ethel for being part of this Gargoyle King's plot.
@marisolnichols Hope Hermione and Veronica work together to bring Hiram down. Maybe her and Fred could get together, make Hiram a cuckled.
@WriterRAS I want Hermione to put her foot down when it comes to Hiram. Why doesn't she stand up to him? She's mayor now. My God!.
@CW_Riverdale What is he being roped into now?
@marklevinshow I believe some of the President's rhetoric may be part of the bomb scare. Someone, perhaps, took his words literally.

@LauraLoomer Time will tell.
@RiverdaleWriter @CW_Riverdale Hope Archie can try to be a mole against Hiram, and that Hiram gets his empire taken away from him, and that Mayor Hermione Lodge has a plan to do so, with Veronica's help, of course.
@WyattEarpLA It will.
@Millie__Weaver @jetrotter More questions then answers. Still, the fact someone tried to bomb locations is an issue.
@marklutchman You are.
@DYINGtoLlVE @LindaDark6 @ScottPresler Agreed. The truth will come out eventually, and, I hope no one is hurt or killed. I hold no ill will toward politicians personally, even if I often disagree with them on several things.
@leanneaguilera Theories for season 3. 1: The Gargoyle King is Edgar, or some other cult leader using an alias. 2: Archie may try to be the warden's mole inside the prison.
@ScottPresler I will vote, but, we must not allow false fears to rule us when we do vote.
@LindaDark6 @DYINGtoLlVE @ScottPresler True, the timing is quite unusual.
@DYINGtoLlVE @ScottPresler True, and his idea is possible, but, no proof has been found yet.
@cindy_uzzell @Jeanne_vanced @ScottPresler If someone's targeting both sides just for kicks, we may be dealing with a very sick person.
@DYINGtoLlVE @ScottPresler Agreed. Someone will be caught, I'm certain. The possibility that some terrorist or madman may be involved must not be ruled out.
@cindy_uzzell @ScottPresler Agreed. There are real white nationalists that are attempting to use the GOP to their own advantage, that must not be overlooked.

@luvthmgators @brandongroeny Alright. Don't get me wrong, I'm supporting Trump, but, he does tend to say or do some things I either don't agree with, or have found to be untrue. Accusing Ted Cruz's father of being part of the JFK assassination, seriously?
@luvthmgators @brandongroeny Oh? First I'd heard of it. Can you confirm this info as fact?
@jimmyraywatts @hrenee80 Even a blind guy from Ohio, eh?
@realDonaldTrump I'll pray for his family, even if I don't know the details yet.
@WriterRAS Why the hell is Hiram so obsessed with keeping Veronica and Archie apart? I predict he won't win, and that hihs little empire will soon come tumbling down.
@brandongroeny I've heard it's from opposition figures in Hundoras, or however it's spelled, not Democrats. Another thing, where's the President's evidence that people from the Middle East are part of it? If there is, I demand he show it.
@ScottPresler I'll vote too, even if I have a headache from a dentist appointment that I could have the same day as voting, even if the weather could be bad, I'll still make the effort.

@EricTrump Your father is getting much done. However, he appears, and, this is only my opinion, to think more about himself then anyone else around him. If that's the case, I feel it's the wrong attitude for a President to have.
@DonaldJTrumpJr No doubt he'll do it, if it comes to that, praying it won't reach that point.
@realDonaldTrump @C_3C_3 You're certain some are from the Middle East? Also, a reason they're being forced to leave is the gang violence in the nation, something you, and others are over looking, Mr. President.
@marcorubio @sally_lynn0805 @POTUS Iran is going to have a field day, I agree. If the Saudi's did kill him, it gives Tehran a huge propaganda boost.

@Theresa765 Disagreements, I can live with, hate though, that's another thing, and one I can do without.
@ScottPresler Agreed. He was a great senator, great war hero, because he survived capture, not because he was captured, and a great man. Wish President Trump would treat him with respect.

@thabulldog34 @realDonaldTrump Trump seems to be doing more about it in public then he is in private, that's how it looks to me.
@Scaramucci @POTUS @KingJames Agree with you, Anthony, he shouldn't stick his nose where it doesn't belong, if you know what I mean. I wouldn't call his attacks racist, as much as extremely foolish, and also, unnecessary.
@realDonaldTrump Witch hunt, yes. However, Mr. President, I urge you to take the idea that Moscow attempted to influence the election, not to back you or Hillary, but, to simply cause harm, seriously, please!. For the love of God, take advice from your DNI and others who say they're trying again.
@ScottPresler I plan to. Heck, I'm even backing plenty of candidates I can't vote for.

@djcelrock If you'd like, I can wait to contact you after you've had time to relax.
@djcelrock Weird, think there'd be an article on how to do that somewhere. We  can check to find out if there is a way some time.
@djcelrock Not sure if there's a way you can report getting these scam pop ups or not. If there is, I haven't heard about it yet.
@djcelrock It's some type of tech scam. Got some of those at times. It'll claim you have viruses and want you to call a number. Fake Microsoft stuff.
@djcelrock Is it saying 'congratulations, you've won'? I'd get those when I had Internet Explorer, so annoying.
@djcelrock Yeah.
@djcelrock Ah. At least it's fixed. Shame you weren't able to fix them in time for the show. Hope next week, you won't have those issues.

@AnyaBadowski Over-reacting much?
@attack_rack The idea the US government would plan to bring down the buildings, or that there is some kind of outside force at work at governments is, in my view, laughable.
@attack_rack Stubbron man, aren't you? I respect that, but, cannot agree with your views on 9/11, or the idea that school shootings are false flags, if you believe in that.
@usminority @DineshDSouza Afraid I can't come, but, if your anywhere in Ohio, please, be sure to let me know so I can try to make it to any event.
@attack_rack Seems we're at a stalemate then.
@AnnCoulter I don't trust Putin at all, former KGB and all, but, the idea he's directing illigal immigrants sounds rather far fetched, at least to me.
@WriterRAS @CW_Riverdale The fun begins. One thing I hope happens is Hermoine stands up to her Richard Nixon-esque husband.
@attack_rack Very well, but, suppose I find your conclusions to be incorrect?
@JaySekulow I am. Also, I believe the Turkish President must present any evidence of the pastor's alleged role in the coup attempt, which, he has not done, perhaps because he knows the accusations against him are false.
@AnyaBadowski Shadowbanned? Haven't heard that term before.
@attack_rack Where would I begin to research your claims to see if I find them to be true or not?
@AnyaBadowski @GreggJarrett Cool!. I wouldn't keep it, but I'd listen to and review it. Love using Audible, since a lot of books I'd like aren't in braile, me being born blind.
@AnyaBadowski I've followed you, hope you can follow me back in time.
@realDonaldTrump @AnyaBadowski I've seen it on Audible, I'll get a copy at some point, review it, too.
@okelanihunter QANON? Not sure what that's supposed to stand for.
@seanpware Thanks, man.
@SecPompeo The Turkish President must present evidence of the pastor's guilt, which, so far, he has not done.

@attack_rack We started off on the wrong foot. I do support Trump, and many of his allies. However, I cannot support ideas where there is no evidence to prove them. You can do as you wish with me, but, I do wish not to have to block you or anything of that nature.
@marklutchman I do. Snowflakes? Explain, please. Also, you're close, it's Walk of fame, typo, I'm sure.
@BradThor Putin is a man not to be trusted, I believe.
On the Trump tape CNN released last night. If real, Trump should be held accountable. With the ex lawyer. To my knowledge, a lawyer recording his client has not been done before, not that I'm awre of, anyway.
@attack_rack @bittick_joe @freedom_moates The idea  that the government planned 9/11 has been debunked for years, I have no doubt of that. I am open-minded, but, also level-headed and free thinking. It is likely that the Saudi's planned it, based on what I have read, or a t least approved of it.

@BarleyAndBeans We're in agreement. Some of his policies I like, others, not so much. Follow me back, if you want to, of course.
@messymason Q and the plan? Mind explaining?
@BarleyAndBeansI may be a Trump supporter, but I'm more level headed on most issues then many of his fans, and hope to find friends or followers on both sides of the aisle.
@bittick_joe @attack_rack @freedom_moates Agreed, a lack of security played a role in both situations, thanks for backing me up, Joe.
@FohlenPatrick Thanks for liking my reply, but, I'm getting some flack from Jones fans, Ugh, me and my big mouth, but, I like to speak my mind.
@STUinSD Was recommended to you by someone, like what I've seen so far. Follow back when you can.
@attack_rack @freedom_moates That may be so. Jones, however, in my opinion, seems to spread what he knows are lies. Example, claiming Sandy Hook was a false flag, or that 9/11 was an inside job, nonsense and lies.
@freedom_moates What'd the fool say now? Never cared for Infowars, a lot of conspiracy theories to me.

@djcelrock Thanks for letting me know about that, wanted to check.
@djcelrock Odd. I'll look into how to block numbers, haven't done that with an iPhone before. Wonder if Siri has the aiblity to do that or not.
@djcelrock I hate that. I get something similar. Numbers I don't recognize appear on my iPhone, but, I wait to see if they leave a voic email or text them when I get the number to see if they'll reply or not.
Got the new Daniel Silva novel, loving it, big fan of his. Also have a new laptop, and some new software for it.
@nickandmore Sounds very promising.
@djcelrock I'm sure we're not the only ones.
@djcelrock Hopefully, this will spur fans to update stories when they can, and maybe the reboot eps will inspire fanfics in the future.
@djcelrock So cool!. Now all we have to do is wait for info on the voice cast, and get a release date, but, the fact it's coming back is great!.
