@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends And so are you!!!
@tedcruz I wrote you today through your website. Called and left you a voicemail too. Shouldn‚Äôt be too hard to find. I have no Twitter handle. Just first and last name. Resident of Texas. I want you to step up and end the shutdown. Whatever it takes. Read my email. Listen to my message.
@RepAdamSchiff @ncsupport Then why give him the power. You and the senate are an equal branch of government. Make a plan, find a way, and you end the shutdown. No wall or budget item is worth the millions of Americans suffering right now. @SpeakerPelosi @senatemajldr @SenSchumer
@JohnCornyn I wrote you today through your website. I also called your office twice. When I requested to speak to a person it just rang until a general message is played in your voice and then the line is disconnected. I called back and left a voicemail to the main inbox. You should listen.
@realDonaldTrump I‚Äôll tell you and @SpeakerPelosi what is immoral. Fighting over this wall with 800,000 fed employees, additional govt contractors, small business owners, farmers and all of these families as pawns. You both suck at your jobs! #weneednewleadership
@RepAdamSchiff I agree, this is deplorable, especially if proven. But you and every house rep needs to prioritize your focus on reopening the government. I don‚Äôt care about your party, I don‚Äôt want you to think about your party, I want you to think about the people without pay. Help them first!
@BetoORourke what would you do?  Do you stand with your party and stick to your guns and say no wall no matter what or do you say this is not worth it and you support a bill that reopens the government, helping millions of Americans, even if it has $5.7B in wall funding?
@realDonaldTrump Did these criminals cross at the exact spot where your $5.7 billion wall will go? And what does this have to do with not paying 800,000 fed employees? You are playing with peoples health and well being. All you want is to win. All we want is a President that will do what‚Äôs right.
@realDonaldTrump What about the financial crisis on over 800,000 families your shutdown has created?  Those workers, their kids and spouses have nothing to do with the wall. But yet, you and your demands vs @SpeakerPelosi and her demands, have created this despair. Shame on you both.
@cheech20101 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi I say sit with all 4 of them, include @senatemajldr, and remind them they were elected by the people to work for the people. They are all accountable for this shutdown because they cannot prioritize the needs of the people. No fight over a wall should come before the people.
‚ÄòWhat the f*ck were we thinking?‚Äô: Trump‚Äôs hardcore supporters are finally turning on him https://t.co/QD4XCO0fdd via rawstory @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr
@ananavarro @KamalaHarris Ana - I appreciate your insight on CNN, Bill Maher and elsewhere. Would like to see you support a govt reopen no matter what. Put your influence to work. Wall or no wall, I don‚Äôt care one way or the other. The lives of millions should come first.
@KamalaHarris Then work on a deal to reopen the govt first and then worry about your future political ambitions to be President after that. That‚Äôs how you earn my vote and the vote of every one of my friends. Wall or no wall, that doesn‚Äôt matter to us, millions of Americans struggling do!
@TinaKendrick @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr @SpeakerPelosi I agree with everything you said except about not getting a wall. I don‚Äôt care about the wall. And I live in TX. But what I do care about is how this political back and forth showmanship and ego tripping is occurring on both sides, and it is directly hurting millions. Its stupid!
@BarackObama put your Sen hat back on. What would you do to end this shutdown? There has to be someone you know that is really struggling with this crisis. Do they care about a wall or do they care about taking care of their family? Hope your counsel is sought and this prevails
@JoeBiden what are you doing behind the scenes to get this reopened. Tell @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer to get the government open and then fight the issues that are important to democrats and their constituents. What would you do?
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Okay. Now you have identified that correctly (POTUS IS NOT A GOOD PERSON) and you have reprieve for DACA &amp; TPS back on the table 31 days later, vote to reopen the govt. Then once govt is reopened continue to fight for them and other issues and make sure 2020 goes our way!
@SenSchumer How do you think he would handle this crisis? Do you think he would vote a bill to reopen the government to the benefit of millions instead of not crossing the aisle and holding a party line? Lead your minority body of Sens to vote for the reopening of the govt. @SpeakerPelosi
@realDonaldTrump They want more than a thank you. A thank you does not pay the mortgage, it doesn‚Äôt provide medicine for a sick child, it does not buy groceries. So when evicted and living in a car, ppl can say to their kids well at least POTUS is grateful. @senatemajldr @SpeakerPelosi compromise
@KamalaHarris good luck with your campaign. Show us some leadership now and vote to reopen the government. Strings or no strings show that your party is above this standoff and for the people, not the popularity of the pundits. Lead your party and end this, then lead the USA.
@realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow Really?  You neglect federal workers and your duties as POTUS to weigh in on this?  You shouldn‚Äôt have time for this with the crisis at hand, whether it be your made up one or the real one you‚Äôve created with this shutdown?

@EdKrassen So long as you go to confession, ask for forgiveness and do a penance.
@realDonaldTrump @VP Think about this as you reflect on the honor to visit the MLK Jr. Memorial. Would he stand up for the unpaid fee employees and say our people are more important than a budget fight over a border wall, or would he succumb to partisan bickering and ego grand standing? #Compromise
@shifty1080 @SpeakerPelosi @swingleft @realDonaldTrump He flinched. He budged. Don‚Äôt get greedy. Think about those without pay and with hardship.
@realDonaldTrump Open the government and the negotiate DACA for border security. No reason for 800,000 families to stay caught in the cross fire of these ego battles between you and @SpeakerPelosi
@HouseDemocrats you are 235 strong. The Speaker has ineptly boxed all of you into a do or die corner of no money for border wall. This is just as extreme as POTUS demand for $5.7B. You need to get back into session and select a new Speaker that can do better for the country.
@SpeakerPelosi @senatemajldr I propose a bill that suspends all pay and expense reimbursements for legislators during any level of government shutdown. Also recesses &amp; holidays should also be suspended. Senate &amp; House must be in session all day, every day, including weekends.
@realDonaldTrump Nobody but you and members of the House and Senate are thinking about 2020. People are thinking about the mortgage, the childcare and the utility &amp; grocery bills that they have to pay without any income. Take that burden off of them and take on the responsibility to make a deal.
@realDonaldTrump I only slept 2 hours last night because of the worries over my finances due to the government shutdown. I don‚Äôt want to hear you brag about the economy. I want you to reopen the government.
@samissastoner @SpeakerPelosi @swingleft @realDonaldTrump I think you mean there‚Äôs.
@SenCortezMasto But aren‚Äôt you doing the same thing by not conceding and then continued negotiations?
@HeartnSoul77 @SpeakerPelosi @swingleft @realDonaldTrump Are you going without pay right now?  That might change your opinion.
@LovesPatriot @SenatorDurbin @swingleft Neither do the GOP politicians or we wouldn‚Äôt be in this mess. They left DC yesterday when they should have started to work on this through the weekend. They are all being paid and not working and forcing other to work with no pay.
@SenSchumer The concessions provided today are good enough to make a deal.  DACA and TPS extended for 3 years goes past his term. I want your support for this bill. I want your support to reopen the government. Get @SpeakerPelosi on the same page. Get the other DemSens to support
@samstein @swingleft Okay. Great score keeping. But how does this help?  Everyone is becoming partisan again and forgetting about the govt employees and contractors hanging in the balance as leverage. All are culpable in this. Make the deal and show your priorities are for the people not the party.
@JohnDRobinson @dodgerzfan1220 @SpeakerPelosi @swingleft @realDonaldTrump No. It‚Äôs all of them on both sides of the isle. They are all culpable. The fact that @SpeakerPelosi said it‚Äôs a non-starter in the house before speaking to @HouseDemocrats is wrong. Both sides are using millions of Americans impacted by this shutdown as leverage.
@SenCoryGardner Well said!!!  We need @SenateDems to chime in on the same compromising theme.
@realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr @SpeakerPelosi 		The most upsetting thing today is that none of these ‚Äúleaders‚Äù have decided that using fed employees, fed contractors and their families as leverage to get their way, their political win, is morally wrong. All are culpable.
@RepEscobar I feel the concessions provided today are good enough to make a deal.  DACA and TPS extended for 3 years goes beyond his term. I want your support for this bill. I want your support to reopen the government.
@SenCortezMasto I feel the concessions provided today are good enough to make a deal.  DACA and TPS extended for 3 years goes beyond his term. I want your support for this bill. I want your support to reopen the government.
@SenDanSullivan @USCG I disagree with the thought of just paying one group over another. No argument about heroics or patriotism. But you should fight for all not just one.
@RepCummings I feel the concessions provided today are good enough to make a deal.  DACA and TPS extended for 3 years goes beyond his term. I want your support for this bill. I want your support to reopen the government. Stand up for our 800,000 fed workers and concede your vote
@RepDanKildee I feel the concessions provided today are good enough to make a deal.  DACA and TPS extended for 3 years goes beyond his term. I want your support for this bill. I want your support to reopen the government.  Put 800,000 first!!
@MarkWarner I feel the concessions provided today are good enough to make a deal.  DACA and TPS extended for 3 years goes beyond his term. I want your support for this bill. I want your support to reopen the government. This is your opportunity to reopen the govt.
@MartinHeinrich I feel the concessions provided today are good enough to make a deal.  DACA and TPS extended for 3 years goes beyond his term. I want your support for this bill. I want your support to reopen the government. Put the welfare of 800,000 fed workers first
@SpeakerPelosi @swingleft @realDonaldTrump I feel the concessions provided today are good enough to make a deal.  DACA and TPS extended for 3 years goes beyond his term.

@SenatorDurbin @swingleft Senator, this is easy for you to say since you are not going without pay. Think about your constituents.
@MikeLevinCA I feel the concessions provided today are good enough to make a deal.  DACA and TPS extended for 3 years goes beyond his term. I want your support for this bill. I want your support to reopen the government.

@realDonaldTrump This shutdown is going to impact our GDP by Billions. I don‚Äôt think we will see you boasting in Jul &amp; Aug when the impact finally gets accounted for and the ripple effects are still being dealt with. The largest employer source in US, small biz, has been denied over $2B in loans!
@SenGillibrand Hello Boone. Let me take some time asking for your vote while I neglect to represent the people who already voted for me to do my job. I‚Äôd rather be here than in DC trying my best to come up with a compromise or a plan to reopen the government.
@smerconish would love to see you report about a forgotten segment of our country and economy. Small businesses have been denied access to more than $2B in small business lending since the shutdown. 97% of all businesses are small in the US. $2B impacts more than 40,000 jobs.
Philip Glover - National VP, American Federation of Government Employees just said to @smerconish that it‚Äôs illegal for fed employees to strike. Shouldn‚Äôt it be illegal to not pay them?  I say walk. If there are consequences, then I say class action lawsuit. This is tyranny!
@SenGillibrand How many federal workers did you leave behind this weekend?
@thehill And where are you today @SenWarren? Are you in DC working for the people and working to end the shutdown?  None of you should leave your post until the govt is stable and fully functional. Lead your party to compromise to end the shutdown and then I will consider your run POTUS.
@realDonaldTrump Yeah, media is the one with the credibility problem. You flip-flop your facts/opinions on issues sometimes within the same speech. The reason? You can‚Äôt memorize a speech and/or you struggle with a TelePrompTer because you read on a 5th grade level. So you talk out of your ass
@christinawilkie Why is anyone in the Senate or House anywhere but D.C.?  @LindseyGrahamSC @SenGillibrand and others need to be working together to get a bipartisan Senate majority to represent the majority of its citizens that believe the shutdown is wrong and want it ended.
@SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems 		If POTUS, as speculated, today offers a compromise, take it and run with it. That is Victory in itself. Put the federal employees back to work with pay. #EndTheShutdown

@SenGillibrand Big mistake being in IA. Should be in D.C. serving the people of NY and working to end the shutdown. Instead you are focused on an event 22 months away. This is not leadership, this is selfish acts of personal gain. Be for the people, not for yourself. Such a #trumpmove
@realDonaldTrump @newtgingrich Newt is a dumbass. What is the basis of this statement? Lincoln was shot, so I think that is pretty bad treatment. And so were Garfield, McKinley, JFK and Reagan. None of them shut down the govt. Nixon was impeached and so was Clinton. So again, what is the basis? #EndTheShutdown

@SenGillibrand @JDScholten More grateful than you are of the Federal Workers and millions of Americans you abandoned by leaving your post in Washington?  Would prefer you to be working in the Senate to find a way, any way to reopen the government.
@USSenate @USHouseofReps if you left Washington for the break, for whatever reason, and the government is still partially shutdown and 800,000 federal workers go without pay, then you are sending the message to your constituents and the Fed Workers that you just don‚Äôt care.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Then you have nothing to worry about and you can focus on AMERICA FIRST and reopen the government so American Federal Workers can get paid. So American Small Businesses can get funding. So American Farmers can prosper. So the American Economy can flourish.
@realDonaldTrump THEN PUT AMERICAN FEDERAL WORKERS BACK TO WORK - WIT PAY.
@realDonaldTrump END THE SHUTDOWN NOW!!!!
@ttgannon @SenGillibrand Easy. 800,000 federal workers and over 2 million government contractors. Average family of 4.

@SenGillibrand Iowa? You are a Senator from New York. This is a personal aspiration trip for your 2020 run. No one cares about this right now. There are more people struggling due to shutdown (over 10 million) than there are people in entire state of IA (3.1 million)
@JohnCornyn Senator, every prescription drug and OTC drug is too expensive for all the federal worker‚Äôs families that are currently not getting paid due to the shutdown. Make a deal and reopen the government

@realDonaldTrump By running for President. Make deal. Put federal workers and government contractors back to work. If you are innocent then the investigation shouldn‚Äôt bother you. Stop worrying about yourself so much and start worrying about the people of the USA.
@realDonaldTrump Mueller? I don‚Äôt think millions of Americans going without pay are worried about that. They are worried about paying bills, taking care of their families. This is just selfish of you to tweet this. You are responsible for these families. This is the responsibility you asked for..
@RBReich @ncsupport McConnell is fully subservient to Trump. As such, there is no longer a balance of power and the executive branch is in full control and responsible for the shutdown and all that comes with it.
@RepAdamSchiff @ncsupport Now vote to reopen the government no matter what it takes, even a $5.7B wall. It won‚Äôt even be built before 2020. GOP and POTUS don‚Äôt care about fed workers or contractors and their families. But you do. So do other Dems. Say as much and end the shutdown. It will lock in my vote.
@thehill And admin never will care about people‚Äôs lives. It‚Äôs no longer worth $5B. End the shutdown, then fight the wall. It won‚Äôt even be constructed before the end of his term in 2020. Our sights need to be on you ending the shutdown. Be a better leader than POTUS @SpeakerPelosi
@lisamurkowski @POTUS Senator-your party needs new leadership in the Senate Chamber. Vote a new Senate Majority Leader. One that will exercise the power of the Senate to be an equal power to the Executive Branch. @senatemajldr is not leading your party, he is subservient to POTUS. #EndTheShutdown

@lisamurkowski Should also work day and night this week to get the government reopened.  I say pay for the wall and border security. Take credit for putting people back to work. POTUS will still carry the blame into 2020. Get @SpeakerPelosi on your side. Get @SenSchumer on your side too.
@RepJeffries @HouseDemocrats High road. Hate autocorrect
@RepJeffries @HouseDemocrats I agree. But other than just saying it has to end, what are you willing to compromise on. @HouseDemocrats have to take the high wall and say this shutdown is more important than opposing a wall. People are more important. Take credit with millions that you got something done.

@realDonaldTrump So can you. You are all wrong here. If you are taking to twitter to say that it can be fixed by Democrats in 15 minutes when you have the same potential, then you are at fault too. And stop the name calling. You look stupid when you do that. You are not 8 years old.
@realDonaldTrump You should have been working all weekend long, not waiting. Not acting like a 4th grade bully and focusing your time on calling other adults names like bozo or lyin‚Äô. Better yet, you should spend your weekends speaking to a therapist. It would do the country a lot of good.

How is this relevant to today?  It‚Äôs the baseline to the fact that the GOP will put winning before the American people, before the federal workers, before women, children and men of all races and nationality. I expect the GOP to roast marshmallows while the country burns. @GOP
2016 is when the GOP traded in its morality for the sake of winning. When the reporter interviewing a pussy grabber is held to account and is fired while self-procliamed pussy grabber is rallied around by GOP for sake of winning, the paradigm shifted across the entire party.
@thehill I find it concerning that a tv newsman that accidentally slurs king and junior together is held to a higher standard than a politician that intentionally articulated racist opinion.

@USHouseofReps @PeteOlson @TeamPelosi @DanCrenshawTX @PeteSessions You still get paid while govt workers do not due to shutdown. It should be law that you don‚Äôt get weekends off, you don‚Äôt even get to leave the capital while govt is shut down and you still get paid.
@USSenate  @senatemajldr @tedcruz @JohnCornyn  The Senate is getting paid and taking the weekend off. It should law that if you still get paid, even when govt is shut down, you all should be locked in the Capitol until you strike a deal.  Kind of like Jury Duty.

@realDonaldTrump 800,000 FAMILIES did not get paychecks today. Average family of 4 means 3.2 million people are impacted directly by your lack of empathy. Lack of leadership. Lack of common sense. $1 billion economic loss each week this shutdown continues.
@tedcruz @JohnCornyn are you even in Washington?  Bet not. So you are not at your job, not working to reopen the government, and still getting paid while 800,000 people who want to work can‚Äôt and are not getting paid. Another week another $1B economic loss.
There is still the Russian investigation. The media will highlight every lie and misstep of POTUS that the DNC should have the advantage in 2020. And then you can tout how you did what was right for Americans and he didn‚Äôt. You got the govt working again. You were a leader.
The million plus Americans missing paychecks and ruining their credit, are more important than this political battle for 2020. That is all this is. All of Washington is so wrapped up In who wins this battle wins the war, wins 2020 that they have lost focus on the American people.
@SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer I‚Äôve given up. I don‚Äôt support a wall, but I support my family. And I cannot do that with the partial government shut down. You‚Äôve lost this battle. Take the high ground and put the millions of Americans suffering first. Pass the wall budget.

@realDonaldTrump That is not what is proved. It proved that your brand on the party is failing. Alabama is the reddest of red states. But no matter the red or blue or whatever, there needs to be decency in the candidate being elected. You should not have endorsed Moore. You are losing! #2020
