The sheer number of children separated tell only part of the story. There is simply no way to quantify the depth of trauma that the administration has caused.		To protect these families and prevent future separations, Congressional oversight is critical. Here are five steps: https://t.co/0HvItO0jwX
What's worse, separations are still happening.		Even after the court's order blocking the policy, the government has continued to unilaterally declare parents a danger to their child that they can take them away, without any oversight.
The Trump administration is refusing to take the necessary steps to bring families back together again, or even to figure out the true scope of the human rights crisis that they created.		The cruelty is shocking.
Last month a government report revealed there may have been thousands of additional, unreported, separated families.		Last week the administration said they have no adequate system to find out how many families it ripped apart — and they don't think it's worth the time to try.
It's only been through litigation, advocacy, and countless hours spent by partners and NGOs tracking down parents, that we've been able to reunite more than 2,500 families.		The work still isn't over.
Thankfully the court rejected the idea that the administration wasn't responsible.		The judge said it best: "The reality is that for every parent who is not located, there will be a permanently orphaned child. And that is 100 percent the responsibility of the administration."
We know at least 400 parents were deported without their children. Many were misled or coerced into giving up their asylum claims.		The government tried to wash its hands, even saying that if we wanted to find these parents we should use our own "considerable resources" to do so.
The government has resisted reunification at every step. It missed deadlines for a substantial number of families.		At one point, @HHSgov even wanted to make parents to pay for children's flights, because the agency didn't have a budget line for reunification expenses.
We filed a class action in March 2018. In June, the court ordered the practice be halted and the kids reunited.		We were told there were about 2,700 separated families. Nearly one year later, the process of reunifying them is still not complete.
In the fall of 2017, we began to see reporting and hear from our partners that the Trump administration was separating immigrant children and parents in large numbers — even as administration officials repeatedly claimed that there was no family separation policy.
No other administration has implemented a widespread policy to take migrant children away from their parents indefinitely, in an illegal effort to deter asylum seekers from seeking refuge.		A reminder on where we're at in the fight against family separation — thread/

We won’t be fooled — President Trump’s goal is to ban abortion. The president himself has said “there must be some form of punishment” for a woman who has an abortion.
Enough.		Every day, people across our country face the deeply personal decision of whether or not to continue their pregnancy. Instead of respecting that choice, anti-abortion politicians resort to provocative, inflammatory rhetoric that shames women.
Living with HIV is not a crime. Period.		We must address the discrimination and stigmatization that too often comes with an HIV diagnosis. People living with HIV cannot be left behind or left out of the conversation.

We urge you and your colleagues to focus on protecting the First Amendment rights of Americans, rather than undermining them, @MarcoRubio. That means reconsidering the Combating BDS Act.
Your bill violates the core principle of the First Amendment: The government cannot dictate to its citizens which causes they can and can’t support.		That’s not “baseless” – it’s grounded in the Constitution, our history, and two recent federal court decisions.
Was it just “commercial activity” when civil rights activists boycotted segregated restaurants? Was it just “commercial activity” when businesses and individuals boycotted apartheid South Africa?		NO. It was speech protected by the Constitution.
The Combating BDS Act encourages states to pass unconstitutional laws punishing businesses AND individuals who participate in politically motivated boycotts against Israel. These laws have already violated the First Amendment rights of teachers, newspapers, and even students.
With all due respect, @MarcoRubio – it seems like you don't understand your own bill, or the First Amendment.		That's troubling, but we're here to help. https://t.co/qQ1Kgt0IrF

It promotes an unfair process, inappropriately favoring the accused and letting schools ignore their responsibility under Title IX to respond promptly and fairly to complaints of sexual violence.

We'll continue to track members' votes, keeping a scorecard of EVERY members' record on civil rights and liberties. 		See more on our congressional agenda here: https://t.co/RqhoADTKcR
6⃣ Hold the president and his campaign accountable — in open, public hearings — for any misconduct with Russian interference in the 2016 election or 2018 midterms, and any illegal effort to cover up misconduct.
5⃣ Ensure real equality for LGBTQ people in employment, housing, and education.		Pass the Equality Act to guarantee civil rights protections to LGBTQ people.	 	Fight the Trump administration's attempted erasure of trans people.
4⃣ Reform our justice system to ensure fairness and equity, from policing to pretrial, sentencing to reentry. 		Pass the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act to reduce mass incarceration in federal jails.		Investigate police misconduct and DOJ's "law and order" policies.
3⃣ Protect women from sexual harassment, discrimination, and abuse at work.		Start by reforming the Congressional Accountability Act, creating new rules to support and empower victims of harassment in congressional offices, and increasing accountability and transparency.
2⃣ Make our electoral system fair and accessible to all.		Pass the Voting Rights Advancement Act to fight racial discrimination, and the Voter Empowerment Act to modernize voting systems.		Restore the rights of the 4.7mil formerly incarcerated people who've served their time.
1⃣ Rein in Trump's detention and deportation force and unchecked abuse of immigrants.	 	Hold them accountable for the family separation crisis. 		Cut @DHSgov's massive budget, including ICE and CBP — the key tools for terrorizing immigrants — and no funding for the border wall.
The midterms are over and our newly elected members of Congress are just getting started. They work for us and we're going to hold them accountable.		We've made a to-do list for protecting and expanding civil liberties. Thread👇 https://t.co/r2EylUWQpu

Bottom line: Trans and nonbinary people are under attack, and we can't back down.		Being an #ACLUVoter is one way you can fight back and advance equality for LGBTQ people.	https://t.co/aCepSUQA6W
States introduced 20 bills that would grant a license to discriminate against LGBTQ people based on a person's religious beliefs in 2018, and we're likely to see more next year.		The best way to stop anti-equality bills nationwide is to vote like your rights depend on it. Period.
We won't be done on November 7  — let's talk about AFTER the election.		Anti-equality lawmakers will again introduce bills that try to keep trans people from participating in public life, restricting access to schools, bathrooms, and businesses open to the public.
Local school board members can often have just as much, if not more, impact on trans and nonbinary students as state or federal lawmakers. 		And school board members representing nearly a quarter of all students are on the ballot this year.
The #YesOn3 campaign is talking to Massachusetts voters every day about why nondiscrimination laws matter. For this campaign to win, every #ACLUVoter in Massachusetts needs to show up on November 6 to fight back against lies about trans people.
In places where hard-fought protections already exist, your vote may be critical to keep those laws in place. Nowhere is this more clear than Massachusetts, where a 2016 nondiscrimination law is under attack by opponents of trans equality.
In every state and every community — trans and nonbinary people belong. We will fight to ensure our laws reflect that.
No matter where you live, you should be demanding that candidates for Congress pledge to support the Equality Act, a bill that would fill significant gaps in legal protections for LGBTQ people nationwide, as well as update protections for women and people of color.
Trans and non-binary people face discrimination that makes everyday tasks like going to work or going grocery shopping more difficult, if not dangerous. The Trump administration has encouraged opponents of equality, but we won't back down.

This "memory" arrives right in the middle of our fight to depose Ross which the Trump administration has taken to the Supreme Court.		They are desperate to avoid questions under oath and Ross' ever-changing story shows why.
Ross now recalls that in the Spring of 2017, Steve Bannon asked him to speak to Kris Kobach about his idea of adding a citizenship question to the census.		Ross previously told Congress he was unaware of ANY White House conversations about the question. Another lie.

Senators are on notice: If you vote to increase the jailing of immigrant families at the border and continue family separations, we will make sure your constituents remember in November.
Sen. Johnson's bill would:	❌ jail families indefinitely	❌ expand prisons and deportation agents without accountability	❌ threaten children's lives by ending hard-fought legal protections	❌ give the Trump administration leeway to continue separating families
🚨🚨🚨 While the world is watching to see whether the Trump administration will finally put an end to their family separation crisis, @SenRonJohnson introduced a bill that would empower the indefinite jailing of kids and families.
If you want the epidemic of police violence to continue without oversight or accountability, listen to the attorney general.		But if you know that communities are better off when police are properly trained and held accountable for their actions, we're with you.

Children should not be left to navigate the US asylum system alone, bearing the weight of continued separation, because the government unlawfully deported their parents and doesn't want to bring them back.
No parent should lose their right to seek protection from persecution, torture, or death because they were forced to choose between getting their child back or pursuing an asylum case.
This is especially troubling as parents may have been misled or coerced into waiving asylum rights, believing that it would bring back their children faster.
The government is arguing that deported parents and children can only be reunited in their countries of origin.		This means that parents won't be able to resume asylum claims and children may have to forfeit theirs.
Today the government submitted a new plan to locate the hundreds of parents whom it deported without their kids. We've negotiated with them on several fronts, but a huge issue remains 👇

This disregard for commitments made to the court and the life or death circumstances that these immigrant women and children are facing is beyond unacceptable.
The judge ordered the government to turn the plane around and bring the asylum-seeking mother and child back to the US.		He said that if the situation wasn't fixed he would consider contempt proceedings — starting with the attorney general.
While in court, we found out that the government had deported a client and her young child just hours before, putting their lives at risk.		This directly contradicts the government's commitment to the court that NO ONE would be removed until tomorrow at the earliest.
BREAKING: In challenge to Sessions' policy of denying asylum protection to immigrants fleeing domestic violence and gang brutality, the judge blocked the government from deporting our clients as he considers the case.		However, disturbing news came to light during the hearing.

But we will continue to fight increasing the DHS budget—and so should every member of Congress.
Today Reps decided that their priority is to continue funding the administration’s war on immigrants using taxpayer dollars to tear families apart, terrorize immigrant communities, and further militarize our border with an ineffective and harmful wall.
If adopted by Congress, this would increase the budget for ICE and CBP — the agencies responsible for family separation and the mass detention and deportation of immigrants.
The House Committee on Appropriations just advanced a bill today that would increase the DHS’s budget for next year to a total of $51.4 billion, including $5 billion for Trump’s border wall.

It's more apparent than ever that we need to rein in rampant @ICEgov abuses. Tell DHS: https://t.co/7mLmxDyWbo
It's been clear for decades that ICE is a rogue agency with little to no oversight.		We're nearing 200 deaths in ICE detention. It's time to demand that Congress stop funding ICE's jailing of immigrants and reject Trump's attempts to build massive family prison camps.
The independent DHS Inspector General has exposed how ineffectual ICE inspections are, and how delinquent the agency is in addressing serious violations. In some cases, inspectors outright lied — and were caught by the Inspector General during the course of its investigation.
JUST IN: The Inspector General of DHS released a report showing ICE fails to meet basic detention standards, with little to no accountability.		This comes on the heels of DHS's plans to jail tens of thousands of immigrants, including children and their parents, on military bases.
We won our fight against Trump's cruel family separation policy in court, but now we need to take to the streets to demand the administration follow through on the order to reunite ALL kids.		Show up tomorrow to say loudly: #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/eEoG0gYHpO
