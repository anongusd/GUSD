From WH pool report: “POTUS’s CPAC speech concluded at 2:18pm. He spoke for just over two hours.	Members of the audience left early. POTUS concluded his speech saying not one person had left early.”
@markknoller Trump at #CPAC:	-Called Mueller probe "bullshit."	-Boasted of inauguration crowd	-Mocked ex-AG Sessions'  accent--"Ahm gonna recuse mah-self" (after denying reports he'd privately called Sessions a "dumb southerner"	-Mocked other appointees: Powell &amp; Rosenstein	-usual falsehoods
@markknoller He's done. Fox put Trump's #CPAC "speech" at 2 hrs., 2 minutes -- and Fox carried every minute of it.
@markknoller Trump, after nearly 2 hours speaking to #CPAC: "I'm watching those doors and not one person's left."
@markknoller Trump says he's gotten our hostages back from North Korea, including "our beautiful, beautiful Otto."	Doesn't mention Otto Warmbier's parents' rebuke of him for absolving Kim Jong Un of blame for their son's death by torture.
WH keeper-of-the-stats @markknoller of CBS says this "speech" to #CPAC is the longest of Trump's presidency. 	"But just in finishing up..." he just said!	And for the 1st time, nearly 2 hours in, he brings up North Korea &amp; Kim.
TRUMP: "And we kicked their ass."
Trump has been talking so long at #CPAC that he's now taking credit for A SECOND TIME for Republicans' padding their Senate majority (by 2 seats) because he had 32 rallies. 	For all his attacks on socialists here, he's mimicking Castro in the length of this diatribe.
@svdate Trump has passed 90 minutes for this "speech" to #CPAC ... Just now he claimed an immigrant seeking asylum was asked why &amp; replied "murder."	He said it as if the immigrant was admitting wanting to enter US to commit murder -- not leaving his/her country to escape murder.
Trump, no slouch at suing and being sued, told this guy to have his lawyer sue not only the attacker but also the university and the state of California. https://t.co/tkhd4qriM3
@svdate Trump claims he's ruined the presidential hopes of @SenWarren by dubbing her Pocahontas.   	"Now I won't get a chance to run against her and I would have loved it."

Trump's just complained to #CPAC that some people, like CA Gov Gavin Newsom, are nice to his face &amp; then go out in public &amp; attack him.	...This just minutes after Trump attacked Fed Chmn Jay Powell (his own appointee), with whom he just had a chummy lunch recently.

Trump has accepted:	1-Kim's claim of ignorance about Otto Warmbier's torture	2-Putin's denial of election interference, over US intel findings	3-Saudis' denial of murdering a US-based journalist, again over US intel findings	What would Republicans say if a Dem president did that?
Remember Otto Warmbier, the student who died after being held by North Korea &amp; released in a coma?	TRUMP: “Those prisons are rough, they’re rough places &amp; bad things happened." But Kim "felt badly about it...He tells me that he didn’t know about it &amp; I will take him at his word.”
After the summit’s collapse, Trump made clear he was no longer demanding Kim’s “complete and verifiable denuclearization.”	Pompeo last yr: "The complete &amp;  verifiable &amp;  irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is the only outcome that the United States will accept.”

After hours in which Republicans have assailed Michael Cohen by suggesting he'll make a bundle writing an anti-Trump book, John Dean says, "I hope Michael does do a book at some point."	I remember Dean's "Blind Ambition" many years ago as a worthy read.
John Dean sees parallels with Michael Cohen's and his own testimony against Nixon, tells CNN of Cohen, "He regrets having lied, he's telling the truth now and the truth hurts."
Rep. Clay Higgins' questioning of Michael Cohen was so bizarrely bad -- like directing the feds to seize Cohen's boxes of records, after Cohen said feds had them &amp; returned them -- I went to Google to learn more about this 2nd-term LA Republican.	Wow, how did he get elected?
Michael Cohen admonishes Rep. Jim Jordan &amp; other House Rs for focusing in this hearing on his mistakes &amp; crimes:	"Not one question so far has been asked about Mr. Trump."	Americans don't care about his taxes or lies, Cohen said; they want to know about Trump's.
ONLY THE BEST:	Rep. Jim Cooper asks Michael Cohen if he'd ever heard Trump threaten people with violence.	No, Cohen said, "He would use others."	Cooper: "He hired people to do that?"	Cohen: "They were already working there."

@EarlFlashHudson The loss is to the economy, as I wrote.
Kudlow comes to WH briefing to rebut CBO as too pessimistic on growth. Says Trump will lower deficits by 5% across-board cut in nondefense spending (not SS, Mcare &amp; Mcaid). That's about $30b, a pittance vs deficits but from domestic spending already cut to lowest level on record.
More from CBO: The president who promised he'd erase deficits will run for reelection with deficits having risen every year of his term, to a projected &gt; $1 Trillion in FY 20 from $587 billion (under Obama annual deficits declined after the first global recession year).
The president who promised economic growth of 4% or more will run for reelection in a year when, CBO projects, growth will decline to 1.7%.
The shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, $3 billion of which is a permanent loss, acc'g to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.	CBO projected economic growth will slow this year to 2.3%, down from 3.1% as the sugar high from tax cuts abates.

As a candidate in 2000, the last thing George W Bush could agree to publicly was that the 1990 budget compromise was a good thing; the GOP right hated that his Dad broke his no-tax vow to cut deficits. W rarely mentioned his dad during that race, sadly. But he knew history would.
Geo W Bush often told us campaign reporters in 2000, 'History will be kind to Dad.' On election eve, I told him I agreed. He asked why. Me: ADA, clean air/water laws, Cold War end &amp;, most, '90 budget deal--for cutting deficits, helping usher in prosperity. 'Interesting,' he said.

TRUMP (cont'd): "But you really say, why is a parent running up into an area where they know the tear gas is forming and it’s going to be formed and they’re running up with a child. In some cases, you know, they’re not the parents. These are people, they call em grabbers." 2/2
TRUMP, to WH press pool in MS, on migrants:	 “I say, why are they there? First of all, the tear gas is a very minor form of the tear gas itself. It’s very safe. The ones that were suffering to a certain extent were the people that were putting it out there but it’s very safe."1/2
Acc'g to WH pool report from MS, Trump "also called for wall funding and for the criminal justice bill to be brought to the floor" of Senate.		He should talk not to reporters but to Mitch McConnell, who doesn't want to spend time on the bipartisan criminal justice bill.
WH pool report:	Trump "said he would consider closing the border if there’s violence, and he suggested some of the people photographed with children were 'grabbers' and not their parents because it’s 'safer' to be with a child."		He apparently offered no evidence for this claim.
Finally, the Rolling Stones come on to bring this 2nd MAGA rally to an end.
Trump tells MS rally: "For yrs &amp; yrs you watched as presidents apologized for America."		No, they didn't, because past presidents didn't.	But Trump says he doesn't blame Putin for invading Ukraine, or China for trade abuses--he blames past US leaders for their weaknesses instead.
Trump boasts yet again of increasing Pentagon budget to $716 billion this fiscal year.		What he doesn't say: Because annual deficits (predictably) jumped due to tax cuts &amp; such spending increases, he's ordered spending cuts, including $33 billion from military.
Trump boasts of his tariffs on steel and aluminum for boosting US jobs.		What he doesn't say: Those tariffs were a factor in GM's decision to close 4 US plants, costing about 15k jobs.
Trump's reached the point of his MAGA performance where he falsely claims Obama said "manufacturing jobs would never come back."	Having covered Obama, I know firsthand that he focused on mfg jobs so much he was criticized for it given the potential in other sectors.
Trump is not only falsely claiming "the wall" is partly built but also that migrants were only able to breach an incomplete section in recent days.		In MS, which is about 1/3 black, Trump makes the argument that undocumented immigrants most hurt African-American workers.
Trump gives big kiss to Cindy Hyde-Smith after her few minutes of speaking time.		Now he is assailing her Dem rival Mike Espy, describing him as candidate of socialism, open borders, abortions on demand and free healthcare for "illegal aliens."
SC's Sen. Lindsey Graham, who has accompanied Trump to these 2 MS MAGA rallies, gets bigger applause than MS's own Sen. Roger Wicker when Trump introduces him as someone whose defense of Brett Kavanaugh helped get him confirmed to SCOTUS.
Really tepid reaction when Trump introduces Mississippi's other Republican senator, Roger Wicker.
And so far, as at the earlier MAGA rally in Tupelo MS, Trump has not mentioned today's announcement by GM that it's closing 4 US plants for nearly 15,000 jobs.
Like Pence before him, Trump boasts of creating 4.5 million jobs. 	Again: That's fewer than were created in the same period at the end of the Obama administration.
Trump is ticking off states where he campaigned for senate candidates who won, most in red states of course. 	He's saying "fake news" doesn't give him credit.	What he doesn't say: He lost the House majority. Dems gained a net 38 seats.
"We are respected like no time before," Trump says to Biloxi rally, contradicting international polls showing all-time lows.	He makes the (false) claim that foreign leaders always tell him that's so. In public &amp; esp'ly private, longtime allies say otherwise.
Pence sounds like he's taken on a southern accent after his day in MS. 	Trump enters through a faux brick fireplace with four Christmas stockings. 	Biloxi crowd waves "Merry Christmas" signs the Trump campaign's handed out--It's that time of year when Trump exploits a non-issue.
Pence says Cindy Hyde-Smith is "a strong and principled conservative, which is more than you can say about her opponent."		Mike Espy wouldn't object to that.
Pence boasts that 4.5 million jobs have been created since Trump took office.	BIG applause.	What he doesn't say: That's still below the total created in the same amount of time at the end of the Obama administration.
"It's been 2 yrs of action, it's been 2 yrs of results," Pence says. "And as caravans of illegal immigrants" rush the border, this president has made it clear they're not coming in illegally.	Chants of "Build that wall."	Pence: "Oh, we're building it."	No, not yet.
Time for MAGA #2 in Mississippi, now Biloxi.	 Republicans must really be worried about this seat. Not only is Trump doing 2 rallies back-to-back on the eve of the Senate runoff, but VP Pence has been here  all day &amp; is now introducing Trump.
RT @sdonnan: “He came to our community and said, ‘Don’t sell your house. These jobs are coming back,’ ” Green said. “We’ve seen nothing but…

@JayQuinn1993 @brianros1 It is common, for presidents of both parties, to combine "official" and "political" events so as to spread the costs. BUT usually the "official" event is longer than 30 minutes.
His 1st MAGA rally over, Trump heads from Tupelo to Gulfport, where he has a 30-min roundtable on criminal justice reform. That little policy talk allows WH to charge taxpayers some for this political trip. 	Then on to Biloxi, for 2nd MAGA rally for tomorrow's MS Senate runoff.
Trump's Tupelo MAGA rally is a wrap, with the usual Rolling Stones song ... you'd think in Tupelo, they'd play Elvis. 	Like "Jailhouse Rock"?
Trump tells his MS MAGA rally, "Now you have a president who is standing up for your country." 		This just minutes after he's told the crowd how he doesn't blame rivals like China for trade imbalances, as he's told President Xi personally. He blames past US leaders.
Trump tells his Mississippi audience that the 2nd Amendment "is under siege in case you haven't noticed."		No, haven't noticed.
At this MS rally, Trump falsely says estate taxes were killing farmers like Mississippi's before his tax cuts.	The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center projected that in 2017 only about 80 small farms and family businesses--IN THE NATION--paid any estate tax.
Trump: "Am I a politician? I don't know."		He adds, "All I know is I ran one time, and I won."	Chants of "4 more years!"		This at a MAGA rally that's supposed to be for Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith's election.
Again Trump calls NAFTA "one of the greatest disasters of all time" at this MAGA rally in MS -- even though his "new" deal with Canada &amp; Mexico makes modest changes at best.
Yet again, Trump says Republicans will ensure insurance coverage for preexisting conditions - even as his administration is challenging that benefit in federal court, &amp; Rs have voted literally scores of times against it.
Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith says twice that she wants to continue to standing up in the Senate for Mississippi's "conservative values." 		Trump then says of her Dem opponent-- African-American, ex-congressman &amp; Clinton Cabinet secretary Mike Espy--"How does he fit in with Mississippi?"
Now Trump introduces the candidate, Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, hailing her for "standing up to the smear machine" against Brett Kavanaugh.
Trump brings SC's Sen. Graham to the Tupelo MS rally stage, recalling his starring role in the Kavanaugh confirmation.	Graham tells crowd that if you like Kavanaugh, there's more Justice nominees like him coming.
Almost forgot to add to this thread for Trump's MAGA rally in Tupelo, MS -- He began by saying that, except for his blond hair, people told him when he was young that he looked like The King, Tupelo's own Elvis Presley.
As usual, Trump boasts about his crowd &amp; complains that TV won't turns it cameras to show the throngs: "They don't want the people to know how many people are here."	Attn: @realDonaldTrump -- I'm watching on https://t.co/Kj92pNy676
Already, just minutes in, he's drawn chants of "Built that wall!"	Then he follows up by saying that a lot of the wall has already been built. 	FALSE.
"Sometimes my people let me down," Trump tells his rally crowd in Tupelo MS -- he's complaining that organizers put the press space too close to the front, ahead of his fans.	This after he complained about the "fake news" &amp; evoked the usual boos.
RT @EamonJavers: GM CEO Mary Barra is meeting with NEC Director Larry Kudlow at the White House now.
"I don't believe it," he says.	--That climate report is the 1,656-pg product of 13 federal agencies: Trump's administration.	Now all the folks who worked on it know how intel officers feel when Trump dismisses their findings on Saudi royalty, Putin, North Korea, you name it. https://t.co/YWZDVfLq4K
Meanwhile, U.S. Steel still isn't opening the 6-8 new plants that Trump repeatedly &amp; falsely claims it is.	While I continue to use the word "lie" sparingly, these are lies he tells to working class Americans who most believe/support him. Coal mines aren't coming back either. https://t.co/RBrssS8PHD
While Trump continues to roil auto markets, the news from GM--closing 4 US plants--further undercuts his repeated claim US companies are rushing back to open new plants. Guessing he won't mention the closings at his MAGA rallies tonight in Mississippi.	https://t.co/B52WY7fcmX

Trump's ad libs at the White House ceremony for awarding the Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest cvilian honor, were a showcase of his uniquely awkward spontaneity.	A sampling:
@Jimi_Jammin @hamptonsliz Accepting for The Babe was his grandson, Thomas Stevens.
@MommaMaggiex4 @hamptonsliz Receiving the award for the Presley family was Jack Soden, President and CEO of Elvis Presley Enterprises
@DamonMPA @jaketapper Sorry, I shoulda been more clear @DamonMPA -- Maureen Scalia was accepting the honor on behalf of her late husband.
"I was there once, in Las Vegas at the Hilton," Trump recalls of his one time seeing Elvis in performance, and of the fans' exuberance. He said an announcer had to finally say, "Elvis has left the house. If they hadn't said that I might still be there. I wouldn't be here."
Trump introduces Elvis Presley at the Medal of Honor ceremony with a small audioclip of "the King."	"That was my idea," he said, then complained that his staff hadn't played more of the song. "They have no promotional ability, that's why."
Trump introduces the 3rd Medal of Honor recipient, Miriam Adelson; she &amp; husband Sheldon are the GOP's biggest donors. Looking for casino magnate Sheldon in the audience, Trump says,  "You didn't make the front row?" Then he adds, "He's probably angry."
Introducing Maureen Scalia, the late Justice's widow, Trump also recognizes all 9 of their children then adds, 	"You were very busy. Wow. Wow. I always knew I liked him."
Trump, introducing Sen. Orrin Hatch as a recipient of the Medal of Freedom,the nation's top civilian honor, says:	 "He liked me right from the beginning and that's why I like him."
WH outright lies in its statement on CNN's preliminary win in federal court. It says "the court made clear that there is no absolute 1st Amdt right to access the White House."	The judge, a Trump appointee, did NO such thing: He explicitly said he wasn't ruling on 1st-Am issues.

Trump's picked up on Mitch McConnell's disparaging phrase -- "presidential harassment" -- for Congress finally doing its constitutional job of government oversight. The founders considered oversight as important as legislating. 	Also, that's not why the stock market swoons. https://t.co/nQAtkpKoOP

As Trump's done repeatedly since  Kavanaugh's confirmation solidified a 5-vote conservative majority on SCOTUS, he today dismissed a lower court's adverse ruling (this one on DACA) by predicting that will change when it goes to the Supreme Court, where he'll get a "fair" ruling.
Trump complains that because Mueller is "so conflicted," "they" didn't want him to go thru Senate confirmation.	Um, "they" were his GOP AG &amp; deputy AG; "they" chose Mueller. Mueller, who's a lifelong R, wld've sailed thru R-controlled Senate confirmation but it wasn't required.
Trump rejects criticism (incl'g from Kellyanne hub) that Whitaker can't be AG w/o Senate confirmation--Notes Mueller wasn't confirmed.		The 2 aren't comparable. Mueller reports to higher-ups, Whitaker as AG is a "principal" subj only to POTUS &amp; under Constitution must b confirmed

Outrageous the WH has yanked the press credential of CNN's Acosta, based on a lie about his contact with an intern taking a mic from him--video shows he did nothing abusive &amp; even politely said "Pardon me, ma'am."	And Trump lauded a congressman for body-slamming a reporter.

Trump, continuing to boast of GOP election results: "They said Heidi could not be beaten."		FACT: Sen. Heitkamp of ND was considered the single most vulnerable Senate Democrat from the first day of this 2017-2018 campaign cycle.
Yet again Trump boasts that this was a great midterm election for him.	"This has been an incredibly successful one."
Trump says he's still looking at trying to end birthright citizenship, but it'll be up to the Supreme Court. 		Asked whether he still plans to send up to 15,000 troops to the border, Trump says, "You know exactly what I'm doing. What's your next question?"
To reporter who said IRS tax audits don't preclude him from releasing his returns, Trump said, "I didn't say it prevented me. I said lawyers will tell you not to do it." 	He's suggested since '15 that he's prevented. Point is, he's 1st president in 4+ decades to withhold returns.
Yamiche Alcindor, an African American reporter for PBS News House, asks Trump about calling himself "a nationalist" when many people hear "white nationalist." Trump angrily snaps, "That's such a racist question." Twice.

Trump falsely claims media never reports on good economy.	Says if Dems were in power, "you would've had negative 4.2 (% growth) instead of positive." 	FACT: In multiple quarters under Obama, growth exceeded that rate. Current economy reflects trends underway in Obama 1st term.
Trump doesn't give hints of staff shakeup ahead:	"There will be changes, nothing monumental...We have many people lined up for every single position....This is a hot White House."
Trump had claimed foreign leaders called to congratulate him on election victory (!?!), so he's asked which ones &amp; was one of them Putin.	Doesn't give an answer.
Again Trump blames Obama for Putin's invasion &amp; takeover of Crimea: "It was President Obama who allowed it to happen.	When reporter corrects him, he stands his ground.
Trump says he has a secret plan to solve the divisive issue of abortion rights. 	Probably stored somewhere with the secret plan he promised in 2016 for a healthcare plan to insure everyone, &amp; better, at lower cost--the one he was going to produce after taking office. Two yrs ago.
Reporter asks Trump a good Q that's been too long ignored: How can insurance cos cover preexisting conditions w/o an individual mandate, which offsets costs by bringing in healthy folks?	Trump rambles w/o answering but gets in another dig at McCain for voting against repeal bill.
Now he's telling April Ryan to "sit down" repeatedly as she tries to ask about voter suppression in Georgia. 	complains about "hostile" press. The 2020 campaign has begun.
RT @Noahbierman: Trump making it clear he is running against the media, maybe more than Dems, for the next two years.
Trump is going off on Jim Acosta ... "a rude, terrible person" and CNN should be ashamed.. and they're getting into it, with an assist for Acosta from Peter Alexander, who defends Acosta. 		This news conference is wild.
Trump's still claiming he can't release his tax returns when he's under IRS audit.	Since his campaign, the IRS has said it has no problem with taxpayers under audit releasing their returns. (It also hasn't confirmed he is under audit.)
No reassurance for Sessions and Zinke.	"I'd rather answer that at a little bit different time," Trump says on whether he plans to fire Jeff Sessions. 	And he says he wants to look into ethics complaints against Zinke.
Trump says "candidates I supported achieved...achieved tremendous success." 	While he helped esp'ly in red-state Senate races, most candidates he endorsed were defeated.
TRUMP: "I speak to Democrats all the time. They agree that a wall is necessary."		Ask him to name one.
Trump cites Senate gains, saying it could be a net 3 seats or 4, "or perhaps it could be 2, but we picked up a lot."
Extraordinarily, Trump singles out BY NAME, and mockingly, Republican candidates who didn't want his "embrace," &amp; lost. Coffman, Comstock, Roskam, Paulsen, Hugin, Faso &amp; Love:	"Mia Love gave me no love &amp; she lost. Too bad, Mia."
I watched Bush concede his "thumping" in '06 midterms &amp; Obama his "shellacking" in '10. Trump--against all evidence of defeats--hailed his success in "successively beating expectations in the House."	   His predecessors spoke of accepting voters' result &amp; moving forward. Not him.

It's a Saturday night and never have I wanted to hear the Rolling Stones' "You Can't Always Get What You Want" more than I do right now.	But I can tell after dozens of Trump rallies that he's near the end. C'mon Mick!
As usual, Trump at his rally calls his "great, great movement" "the greatest in the history of our country."	Pretty audacious claim in a history that includes movements for black freedom, civil rights, women's vote &amp; rights &amp; so much more. But no one would call Trump a historian.
"SPACE FORCE --That's where it's at!" 	Trump always has that line at his rallies, but doesn't say much more -- that's because there's not much more to say. Pentagon hates the idea as a drain on other priorities.

On a day of 1 of the best mo'ly jobs reports in yrs, Trump said little at WV rally about the economy &amp; tons bashing immigrants:	"Sometimes it’s not as exciting to talk about the economy, right? Because we have a lot of other things to talk about."	The sound you hear? GOP screams.
and strike up the Rolling Stones' "You Can't Always Get What You Want," to bring this latest of dozens of MAGA rallies to a close. 	Eight more before election day. 		I'll never hear that Stones song the same way ever again.
This WV rally -- and Trump -- seems more subdued than usual. That's relatively speaking.
Trump boasts of naming "judges who interpret the Constitution as written."	This from the president who this week said he could override a Constitutional amendment with an executive order.
Now Trump's falsely telling the WV crowd that immigrants seeking legal status never show up for court dates, but disappear into the US:	"Very few people come back, almost none...this is the procedure, this is CRAZY." 	FACT: Most do show up.	https://t.co/MqeXnQW2sM
Trump's falsely claiming "the wall" is almost finished near San Diego.		It's a bollard fence, 1st conceived in 2009, in Obama's 1st year.  The asst chief border patrol agent for the area said "this is a local tactical infrastructure project that was planned for quite some time."
Trump's touchy about reports he's telling far more lies/falsehoods in 7 weeks he's been campaigning. (WashPost found he's avg'g 30/day.)	To WV rally, he summed up Obama's terms as "lie after lie, broken promise after broken promise." 	"Nobody was worse to the press than Obama."
Trump is on the Kavanaugh confirmation at the WV rally and assails Dem Sen. Joe Manchin-- even though Manchin voted for Kavanaugh. He complains that Manchin waited too long to announce support, waitd until after Sen. Collins said she'd vote yes to show GOP had enuf votes to win.
Trump to WV rally: "Wait till you see what our great military is doing on the border."	He could be boasting of economy. Instead, fear-mongering: "Caravan after caravan is forming...overwhelming your schools, depleting your resources and endangering your community."
For the first time, back-to-back Trump MAGA rallies, first one now in Huntington WV, next one this evening in Indianapolis. 	Minutes in he's hit Clinton, "Cryin' Chuck" Schumer, Nancy Pelosi  and "the legendary Maxine Waters" --an upgrade from "Low I.Q. Maxine."

Trump: 	"This is a world w/alot of problems &amp; it has been a world w/alot of probs for many yrs--many many yrs &amp; u could say, frankly, for many centuries. I mean u look at what goes on. But certainly u want protection...They had a maniac walk in &amp; they didn’t have any protection."
Trump called for arming more people to counter shooters, and greater use of death penalty, tho he complained that then "the lawyers get involved."
Wendell Hissrich, Pittsburgh Public Safety Director, wouldn't say how many died. Six injured, four of them police officers.	 "There is no evidence of any IEDs or further threat," an emotional Hissrich said. "It's a very horrific crime scene. It's one of the worst that I've seen."

3)  Most memorably, on Fri less than one hour before the FBI's arrest, Trump tweeted his complaint against the media for reporting on "this 'Bomb' stuff" instead of politics, to hurt Republicans' momentum ahead of the midterm elections.
2) Of Trump's 47 tweets since Monday's first bomb news, 6 were against the caravan of Latino refugees heading toward the US and 4 related to bombs--just 1 of those expressed concern for the safety of targets &amp; that was a retweet of a Pence post. The other 3 gave blame to media.
A thread that's a window into Trump's mindset during a week of domestic terrorism: 	   1) The commander-in-chief tweeted 47x since news broke Monday about a suspected pipe bomb at George Soros' home near New York City -- the first of what would be at least 12 devices by Friday.
Minutes after announcing arrest of the bomb suspect who targeted Soros among others, Trump plays along with supporters chanting "Lock him up!" 	Trump has yet another MAGA rally tonight. Expect more. https://t.co/aOzMAqyRDh

"The SPACE FORCE--That's where it's at!"	This after Trump falsely says he's "secured" $716 Bln "to totally rebuild" military. That reps an increase in annual defense budget but not significantly more than past yrs, adjusted, exc for yrs GOP Congress imposed spending "sequester."
So far, nearly an hour into this rally, Trump has avoided his usual attacks on Clinton, Maxine Waters, Obama &amp; CNN--among the recipients of explosive devices.	He's told crowd several times he's trying to be on his best behavior.
Trump expands on his usual false claim that MS-13 took over Long Island towns, which ICE liberated.	"It's like watching WW 2 movies! It's like watching documentaries on WWI, WW2," he says.	"People in their windows, clapping, they're happy."	Yet Ds want to get rid of ICE, he says.
Trump falsely says, "As we speak, Democrats are openly encouraging caravans of illegal aliens" to cross the southern border.	Crowd boos.	Says people of WI can take on MS-13. "It's like a foreign invasion."
Trump as usual brags "Getting rid of that individual mandate was so impt"--as he insists he's for covering preexisting conditions.		The mandate orig'ly was a GOP idea, to reassure insurers they'd get many new customers, to offset costs of covering people w/preexisting conditions.
Now Trump's brought to stage Leah Vukmir, who's opposing Dem Sen. Tammy Baldwin.	Earlier, Trump said Baldwin wants a socialist takeover of health care, then jokes that he can't scream "They want a socialist takeover!" because "I'm trying to be nice, right?" (post explosives)
Trump brings to stage Scott Walker, who invokes his wife to insist he backs insuring preexisting conditions. "Don't believe the lies," Walker repeats. Trump nods.	Both men have repeatedly backed ACA repeal &amp; both STILL support lawsuits against preexisting conditions coverage.
Trump recognizes WI's Reince Priebus, whom he ignominiously fired as WH chief of staff. 	"We had a lot of fun," Trump says.	He tweeted the firing last yr from AF1, mins after Priebus, who'd been unaware of what was coming, left the plane alone in a driving rain &amp; was driven away.
Trump recognizes House Speaker Paul Ryan, who's there. The crowd reaction is REALLY tepid.	Then Trump mentions Rep. Sean Duffy, who's also there, and the crowd chants "Duffy, Duffy, Duffy."
Trump gets to his mantra that the midterm elections are all about "caravans, Kavanaugh, law and order, tax cuts and common sense."
Trump is boasting about Brett Kavanaugh, "and then I saw the way they made him suffer."
Trump tells the WI crowd that the roots of his opposition to NAFTA were his learning long ago of Canada's unfair dairy trade practices. 		For years, he's said it was because of US businesses leaving for Mexico.
Trump says of NAFTA, "25 years later, I got it terminated."		Actually, his new NAFTA - he calls it USMCA - is mostly a mix of old NAFTA and changes negotiated during the Obama administration as part of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Trump abandoned.
Trump is promoting WI Gov. Scott Walker for reelection. 	Walker, once considered a possible frontrunner, didn't last long as a GOP presidential candidate in '16. Trump says, "He could be nasty, but he was tough and he was smart."
"If you're going to vote Democrat, don't bother," Trump tells WI rally.
Trump tells rally, "Wait 'til you see what happens over the next couple of weeks. You're going to see a very secure border. And the military is ready. They're all set."		More false pre-election promises. As Trump learned in April, law limits using military for domestic purposes.
Trump read initial statement  from teleprompter	"Those engaged in the political arena must stop treating political opponents as being morally defective," he says.	He starts attacking Dems, then says, "Did you see how nice I'm behaving tonight? ...We're going to keep it that way."
Finally they've fixed Trump's mic.	"Let's put it all together. Let's get along."
Trump says media itself has a responsibility to keep politics civil. There are a few cries of "CNN sucks!"		CNN, a frequent target, of course got an explosive device today.
Bad acoustics at this Trump rally in the WI hangar, but he's immediately telling crowd that the explosive devices were "an attack on our democracy itself... Such conduct must be firmly opposed."	“We want all sides to come together in peace and harmony,” Trump says. “We can do it.
As Trump strides into WI hangar, lots of new manufactured signs are here -- "JOBS NOT MOBS"
Sinatra just ended: 	"Regrets, I've had a few	But then again, too few to mention	I did what I had to do	And saw it through without exemption"		And Trump is introduced...
The speakers at Trump's hangar rally are now blaring Sinatra, "I Did it My Way." 		On the tarmac are GOPers Sen. Ron Johnson, House Speaker Paul Ryan &amp; Reince Priebus, the ex-GOP chairman turned short-lived Trump WH chief of staff.
@MrWalterShapiro are you sad, too, to think of Air Force One being made-over?
@FeistyOldHag not that I've seen
Air Force One is pulled up alongside the hangar at Central Wisconsin Airport for Trump's rally. Now, when I see that beautiful plane, which I've been so lucky to ride many times, I'm saddened to think that Trump's changing the design and color scheme from its iconic JFK-era look.
It's starting, tho POTUS hasn't arrived yet. People in Wisconsin look cold.
I'm waiting for the umpteenth Trump MAGA rally to begin in Mosinee, Wisc., but so far https://t.co/oOwo6xfkdC just says "waiting for event to begin."	I don't want to miss a minute...	My one glass of wine is at my side (I have a 1-glass limit on Twitter).

@PauLinNY yes
Trump, to reporters in the Oval Office: "I'm a very non-political person, and that's why I got elected president."
Trump, in a unique critique of the Saudis' murder of Jamal Khashoggi:		"They had a very bad original concept. It was carried out poorly, and the cover-up was one of the worst in the history of cover-ups. Very simple. Bad deal, should have never been thought of."
Trump is talking again about some imminent middle-class tax RESOLUTION. After 2 years as president he should know the difference between a bill and a resolution.

I couldn't believe this. So I read the entire criminal complaint to the end: This federal charge really does end by describing how the defendant stated "that the President of the United States says it's ok to grab woman by their private parts." https://t.co/cFYHlSjAz6
And finally, against the wishes of the Rolling Stones, their "You Can't Always Get What You Want" brings another Trump MAGA rally to a close.
Trump reaches the end: "Our hearts bleed red, white &amp; blue...We are 1 people, 1 family &amp; 1 glorious nation under God. And together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again...&amp; we will Make. America. Great. Again."
Time out for the obligatory tribute to the Texas patriots at the Alamo...
Trump reaches the part where he says we finally have a president who is standing up for the US. 		As usual at recent rallies, he hasn't mentioned Saudi Arabia &amp; Khashoggi's murder, and how the US can't take action that's too strong because we need the Saudis' business so much.
Trump at TX rally: "We will protect Medicare and Social Security. The Democrats will never be able to do it."	After new data showing jump in federal deficit post-tax cuts, GOP leaders have said reductions to entitlement programs are inevitable.
SPACE FORCE! 	"It's where it's at!" Trump tells Texans.
Trump is taking credit for action against opioid addiction. Yet he and many GOP state govts have proposed cuts to Medicaid &amp; opposed it expansion under the Affordable Care Act, which health groups repeatedly argue would be the single most effective step for promoting treatment.
"They said that was impossible," Trump tells the Texans after citing new jobs and fewer food stamps recipients since he's been president. 	Again, the numbers are still below those of Obama's last months for the same period. So, no, no one said it was "impossible."
Back to MS-13, and how it's taken over his former home of Long Island. 	"The towns are liberated, and you see the people are clapping from their windows. It's like war."	Reminds me of his false story of the 1000s of Muslims celebrating on 9/11.
Yet again Trump is assailing so-called "chain migration," the program for LEGAL immigration that's for family unification -- it's the program that Melania's parents &amp; sister took advantage of.
More Democratic dystopia: Trump tells his TX crowd that Democrats are encouraging people to break the law. Says "Democrat laws," activists and judges are responsible for problems at border.
"Voter ID, folks, voter ID!"	Trump says.
Trump claims "Republicans will always protect people with preexisting conditions." 	This week his administration again took steps to allow insurance plans that don't cover people with preexisting conditions.
Trump gets big applause: "We don't worship government. We worship God. These are the values that unite people all across the great state of Texas." 		To Democrats: "Don't mess with Texas."
Trump's taking time to recognize the many Republican congressmen in the Houston audience -- esp'ly thanks to the post-2010 census gerrymandering, there's lots of 'em. Time to pour a glass of wine.
Trump recognizes Sen. John Cornyn in the TX crowd, praises his performance at Kavanaugh hearings--esply against Sen. Dianne Feinstein.	Again Trump flatly says "she leaked"--doesn't mention he's talking about Christine Blasey Ford's charge that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her.
Trump takes credit for federal response to Hurricane Harvey in Texas.
There it is, the Trump closing-argument bumper sticker for 2018: 	"Republicans produce jobs, Democrats produce mobs."		AGAIN: as good as the economy is, In Trump's 20 months in office, fewer jobs have been created than in Obama's last 20 months.
Trump boasts of his tough trade actions against China. 	"We're not down any more, folks, we're way up."	The US trade deficit is way up.
Trump is mocking talk of "the blue wave."	"The blue wave is being dissipated," he says.	"You don't hear about it too much."
Trump says "O'Rourke" will take away Texans' guns, let in MS-13 and empower Maxine Waters.	   He goes on against "that beauty," "Low IQ" Maxine Waters, longer than usual, segues to assail Feinstein &amp; Cory Booker, "Pocahontas" Warren -- 3 women and 2 African-Americans, just sayin'
Head fake. He left Beto to boast of his own achievements.	Oh... back to "O'Rourke"
Now Trump has turned to Beto -- "he's actually a radical open borders left-winger."
Trump to TX rally: "The Democrats would rather destroy American communities than defend America's borders...The Democrats are a big risk to the American family."		Again calls 2018 the election of Kavanaugh, caravans, tax cuts and common sense.
Trump, after many rallies at which he's insisted "We're respected again," apparently has heard about the internat'l polls showing negative ratings of the US are the highest ever.	Of course, he says -- because he's making them pay up.
Trump offers a definition: "A globalist is a person who wants the globe to do well but doesn't care about the country so much."		"I'm a nationalist. Nationalist. Use that word."	Texans chant "USA!"
We've saved your family farms, business and ranches from the estate tax, Trump tells the Texans to big cheers. 	FACT: In 2017, an est'd 5,460 estates owed the estate tax. About 80--80!--small farms &amp; family bizs paid. That's nationwide.
@senatemajldr "If you want the FBI to finally investigate Hillary Clinton..," Trump says, but he can't finish for the cheers from the Texas mob, err, crowd. 	Says he could nominate her for the Supreme Court. BOOS.
Kavanaugh time -- He marvels that he's gotten to name 2 SCOTUS justices already. 	And takes credit for record number of lower court judges.	Credit should go to @SenateMajLdr McConnell &amp; GOP senators who blocked Obama nominees at all levels in 2015-6.
Trump falsely says Democrats are to blame for the migrants making their way north toward the US-Mexico border.	"That is an assault on our country...and in that caravan you have some very bad people."
Not even a minute in, Trump is pointing to the media pen to deride "the fake news" ... for making too much of his feud with Cruz in 2016.
"Fantastic," Trump tells Cruz. They shake hands and bro hug. And Cruz retreats to the sidelines to watch the Trump Show.		Anyone who knows Cruz knows how it must kill him to play second banana/supplicant to Trump in his own state.
Cruz makes a prediction: 	"In 2020 Donald Trump will be overwhelmingly elected as president of the United States."		Then the intro: "Donald! J! Trump!"	And out he comes.
Having lauded Trump, Sen. Cruz takes advantage of the Trump crowd to assail rival Beto O'Rourke.		Reminder: As Trump left for TX, reporter asked, "Do you regret implying that Ted Cruz's dad killed JFK?"	Trump: "I don't regret anything, honestly.  It all worked out very nicely. "
"Do we embrace jobs, or do we give in to mobs?" Cruz asks, stealing a line from Trump.
Trump is delayed, campaign manager Brad Parscale tells the TX crowd so Ted Cruz is coming out first. 	"God bless Texas!" he says. "And God bless Donald Trump."
Formerly "Lyin' Ted" Cruz gets TWO Trumps tonight -- Eric Trump &amp; wife Lara are introducing the president at tonight's MAGA rally in Houston.	Definitely a Trump affair--looks like a lot more Trump signs than Cruz signs.
RT @GenMhayden: Duh!!!! https://t.co/1zoDGk65hr
Q: What about your promise to protect transgender Americans?...  	TRUMP: We're looking at it. We have a lot of dift concepts right now. They have a lot of dift things happening w/respect to transgender right now. You know that as well as I do &amp; we're looking at it very seriously.
Again, total aid to ALL 3 nations in fy18 was $88 million.	Trump a bit ago to reporters:	     "We give them tremendous amounts of money. You know what it is; you cover it all the time: 100s of millions of dollars. They, like a lot of others, do nothing for our country."	FALSE.
"Cutting off...massive foreign aid"		Guatamala got $53mil in fy2018, El Salvador $20.3m &amp; Honduras $15m. Total=$88m	Much of it goes to nongovt'al groups for education, econ'c aid, civil society programs &amp;, in Honduras, programs against child labor &amp; forced labor. https://t.co/BMe7paGWto
Mnuchin meets with the man widely believed to have ordered the murder &amp; dismemberment of a US-based journalist. https://t.co/Xe83AEzgFw
Trump is repeating he'll propose a 10% middle-class tax cut, tho now he concedes he can't get it thru Congress (which isn't in session) before election. 	Given # of people qualifying as middle class (even if they don't feel it), a 10% cut would send deficits soaring even more.
It's been 4 days since Pompeo returned from Saudi Arabia &amp; Turkey and told Trump to give the Saudis a few more days to investigate themselves in Khashoggi's murder.
Rep. Engel, who'd become chmn of Hs Foreign Affairs Cmte if Dems win majority, “Fortunately, Congress—not the President—has the power of the purse, and my colleagues &amp; I will not stand idly by as this Administration ignores congressional intent." https://t.co/BMe7paGWto
"...change our pathetic Immigration laws...So unfair to those who come in legally."	FACT: the only specific laws Trump talks about changing at his rallies involve 2 programs for LEGAL immigration, one of which was used by Melania's parents to gain citizenship. https://t.co/LZ6Vfc6NpW
"A National Emergy" -- "Criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in."	If any other president announced this, it would be taken seriously by all.	With Trump by now, it's just Monday (and pre-election scaremongering). https://t.co/oMPnHVi3oS

@senatemajldr Trump: "We are one people, one family and one glorious nation under God."	When he says that, you know he's at the end--of rally remarks that have been only divisive.		And now, the Rolling Stones' "You Can't Always Get What You Want" signals that another Trump MAGA rally is over.
"We will protect Medicare and we will protect your Social Security," Trump promises.		Since the govt reported a jump in federal deficit in FY2018 post-tax cuts, GOP leaders-- in particular @senatemajldr McConnell -- have said the programs need to be shrunk.
"SPACE FORCE!"		The rally crowd cheers, but that's about all Trump says.
He's boasting of trade gains, in particular with Mexico &amp; Canada, and getting tough with China.		US trade deficit is up.
"I think the women like Trump even more than they did two years ago," he says.
Trump's reached the part of rally performance where he claims the media won't let TV cameras pan the crowd because they don't want to show how large it is.	Didn't know Fox was so anti-Trump! I watched Fox News until even it stopped airing these rallies; now I go on its website.
Nearly skipped over the part about how Trump digressed to complain he gets criticized for calling women "beautiful." He boasts of being not-PC, points to women in rally crowd and calls them beautiful. Cheers. 	Trump refers to #MeToo w/o naming it &amp; complains it's gone too far.
He's attacking media again, pointing to the press pen at the rally &amp; saying "fake news."	Calls them allies of Democrats.	Crowd turns toward reporters and cameras and boo.	"If they were on my side I think I'd be at 100%" approval rating, he says.
Trump's attacking the caravan of migrants coming north from Central America to escape violence. Cont'd border crossings have divided WH but Trump says, "We're going to figure it out. I'll be honest with you--I've already figured it out."	Says he won't tell until after election.
Trump, always fond of branding, is going on about how he's renaming the Democratic Party as "The Democrat Party" because it sounds better. (Actually, GOP's been doing this since Gingrich's time, which is really pretty sophomoric when you think about it.)
"Do we have many Hispanic Americans here?" Trump asks rally crowd.	A few whistles and cheers.	"Not too many," Trump concedes. "We've done better." 	He estimates 5%.	This is in NV, where the sizable Latino vote matters.
"A vote for Wacky Jacky is a vote" to give control of Congress to Nancy Pelosi, "Cryin' Chuck" Schumer and "Low IQ" Maxine Waters, Trump tells the Elko MAGA rally.	Waters had been missing from recent Trump rallies.		I really hate that "Wacky Jacky" label.
Trump blames "unions, and civil service" for protecting workers at VA facilities -- "They're sadistic!" -- until he signed law making it easier to fire people.
Now Trump's attacking Dems for not giving him ONE vote to repeal Affordable Care Act. That, of course, is the law that required insurers to cover people with preexisting conditions--yet Trump &amp; GOP now claim they're FOR that protection.	   Trump also attacked McCain's "No" vote
"There's no better partner that I had in Washington than Dean Heller," Trump says.
@stevebarefoot bloody Mary?
"We don't need a Wacky Jacky in Congress," Trump tells the crowd, referring to GOP Sen. Dean Heller's Dem rival, Rep. Jacky Rosen.		I don't like that nickname AT ALL.
"So Democrats produce mobs, Republicans produce jobs," Trump tells the NV crowd.		FACT re jobs: Fewer jobs have been created in Trump's 1st 20 months than in Obama's last 20 mos.		Trump says Dems would bring "gridlock, poverty, and chaos" and your 401(k)s will "fall like a rock."
Already he's slamming the reporters at this rally, less than 4 minutes in --  "fake news!" -- at a time when a Saudi journalist's murder has underscored how many journalists are being killed worldwide.
Trump's now incorporated his midterm closing-argument slogan -- "Jobs Not Mobs" -- into slick signs that people in the crowd's camera shot are waving.
What a way to spend a fall Saturday afternoon -- it's MAGA rally time on Fox livestream. The announcer in Elko, Nev., just announced "President. Donald. J. Trump!"	Too early for a glass of wine at my side.

Trump tells rally US finally has a president who doesn't bow to foreign leaders:	"Now you have a president who's standing up for America. We're standing up for your values."	--The man who's stood beside Putin, Xi &amp; Kim &amp; blamed their transgressions on weak US leaders. Now Saudis.

SPACE FORCE time! 		That's it, just a mention. Trump moves on to attacking Iran, boasting of moving US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.
It's profanity time at the Trump rally.	 In his usual boast about a law to more easily fire people from VA, he mimics the result: 	"You're fired. Get your ass out of here."
Trump's on to the fiction about ICE and gangs: "They liberate towns, it's like liberation from a war."		ALSO FALSE: Trump says California's openness to illegal immigrants have put it deep in debt. 	FACT: CA has a big budget surplus.	https://t.co/g6jT4kIZkw
Trump: "Everybody that comes across the border, for the most part they're going to vote Democrat."	"That's why Democrats want to give illegal immigrants the right to vote."	False.
Shouting, Trump yet again falsely describes legal migration programs.	Visa lottery? Says countries don't "put their finest in there." FACT: They put NO ONE in; US runs it &amp; individuals apply &amp; are vetted 1st.	"Chain migration"? He's attacking the program Melania's parents used.
"Lock her up" chants right on cue at this AZ rally, at Trump's mention of Hillary Clinton.	This, after his repeated references to "Democratic mobs."
For 2nd time at this rally Trump takes usual jibes at reporters, drawing crowd's attn to the penned-in media. Lots of boos. As usual, he falsely claims media turns off TV cameras when he attacks.	At a time when world attn is on Saudis' killing of a journalist, he doesn't let up.
Trump takes credit for erasing estate taxes for farmers/ranchers at his AZ rally, echoing GOP's longtime claim the tax hits farms &amp; small bizs.	In 2017, an est'd 5,460 estates owed the tax. About 80--80!--small farms &amp; family bizs paid. That's nationwide.	https://t.co/Ds1c5CVJE3
Time for the false claims that "the wall" is being built. He inflates the money he's gotten for it. 		Then he's on to attacking the press, pointing as usual to the area where reporters are penned.
Trump's already on to Eliz Warren -- "I can't use the word Pocahontas anymore. She has no Indian blood." 		Segues to Nancy Pelosi (boos), immediately on to "Crazy Chuck" Schumer.
Trump segues from brief boasts about economy to Kavanaugh's confirmation.	"They treated him badly, they treated him badly," he says of Dems. "Don't forget it on Nov. 6."	"The Dems have become an angry, unhinged mob...Democrats produce mobs; Republicans produce jobs."	Chants: USA!
He starts with the fiction that Obama supposedly said there'd be no more manufacturing jobs. Obama emphasized mfg jobs so much he was criticized for it.
"Hello, Arizona..." and Trump begins yet another MAGA rally, this one in a hangar at Phoenix-Mesa airport. 	He's with GOP Senate candidate Martha McSally, who emerged with him from Marine One after it pulled right up to the crowd. Stagecraft.
As the AZ crowd awaits Trump's arrival at hangar rally, speakers blare The Village People's "Macho Man." 	I wouldn't have guessed that one would make this group's playlist.

Given Trump's focus on military sales to Saudis as reason to go light on Riyahd for murder, I'm re-upping LATimes story last year, after Trump's Saudi visit, on his exaggerated claims re those sales. And jobs? Many wouldn't be in US. @mikememoli 	https://t.co/TB9I9QBvyZ

And now, Trump's "MAGA" line delivered, the Rolling Stones are playing "You Can't Always Get What You Want" and I can return to my regularly scheduled Sat. night. 		Wine, please.
Trump reaches the end notes at his KY rally --"We are one people, one family and one glorious nation under God."	It's always a discordant line after more than an hour of attacks on Dems &amp; other enemies.
Trump tells KY rally, "For years you watched as presidents apologized for America. Now you have a president who stands up for America"	This from the president who's said, as he stood beside Putin &amp; Xi, that he didn't blame them for bad actions--the fault was weak US leaders.
It's time for "The Space Force!" 	Trump tells the KY crowd to cheer loud for it so that their senators there, Mitch McConnell &amp; Rand Paul, realize how popular his idea is.	Implicit in that is he knows many Rs in Congress, as well as Pentagon leaders, do not like his $$ idea.
For 2nd time at KY rally Trump draws crowd's attn to media pen to attack them.	He's delivering the false line about how reporters would've assailed him in '16 had he said he'd create this many new jobs. FACT: The total remains less than for comparable period at end of Obama adm.
Trump's yet again falsely describing programs for legal immigration: visa lottery &amp; 'chain migration' (the 1 Melania's folks used).	Says other nations set up lotteries &amp; pick the candidates. FALSE. Individuals apply to US, are vetted &amp; the US picks.	He's either ignorant or lying.
Trump praised &amp; brought to the KY stage GOP Rep. Andy Barr, who's in a competitive race for reelection.	Trump says Barr's Dem opponent Amy McGrath, a former Marine fighter pilot who flew 89 combat missions, was "hand-picked" by Nancy Pelosi (boos) &amp; Maxine Waters (louder boos).
Yet again, as he's done at past rallies, Trump tells his KY crowd that a huge throng -- 25,000 to 35,000 people -- are outside because they couldn't get in the packed house, &amp; there are "movie screens" set up so they can watch the rally.	None of that is true.
Trump says Mitch McConnell will go down as the greatest Senate leader in history, but adds that McConnell's only been great since Trump became president.
Trump just mocked John McCain's vote against repealing the Affordable Care Act, tho as usual he didn't name him. Trump has done this several times since McCain's death.
It's the Democratic dystopia portion of Trump's rally remarks.	Dems will "take away your health care &amp; your whole life will be unaffordable."	Then Dems will send gangs into city &amp; open borders to drugs &amp; killers. Finally, socialism.
Trump brings Mitch McConnell to the KY rally stage, after lauding him for pushing Kavanaugh's nomination thru.	"Aren't we proud of President Trump?" McConnell asks the crowd. Cheers. 	McConnell promises that together they'll change the courts "forever."
Trump, in Richmond KY for yet another MAGA rally tonight, is celebrating Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to SCOTUS:		"What happened to him was so unfair...But we stuck with him all the way, because we knew the facts."
You almost have to see it to believe it https://t.co/XFsyW6MPcg

@RonBrownstein I absolutely agree.	That said, re future Dem leadership in Congress, I take issue w/criticisms that Pelosi hasn't been 'strong' enough as speaker/minority leader. She's damn strong, but being a good Cong'al leader is an inside game, ill-suited to being seen as a nat'l leader.
@RonBrownstein Perhaps, but I wasn't addressing the future or implicitly offering political advice to Dems post-midterms. I was simply stating my assessment of Pelosi's prior stint as Speaker (&amp; minority leader) vs. the 7 men of both parties I've covered.

As the outrage against Saudi Arabia builds amid evidence it killed US-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi, it's worth remembering that more than 20 Russian journalists have been killed since Putin took office 18 years ago.
10 days after Jamal Khashoggi walked into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul &amp; 1 week after the 1st reports he'd been murdered inside &amp; dismembered, Trump says this to reporters flying with him to OH:	“I will be calling, I will be calling, at some point, King Salman." 	No rush.
Like Pelosi or not, she has been the most effective House speaker of 8 I've covered over 34 years. And in many conversations, many GOP sources (reluctantly) agree.	That group is: Tip O'Neill, Jim Wright, Tom Foley, Newt Gingrich, Denny Hastert, PELOSI, John Boehner, Paul Ryan. https://t.co/sAdibkMrmI
@Twizznit WashWeek, I'm sure. 	And thank you!
And with Trump's sign-off "Make America Great Again" segueing to the Rolling Stones' "You can't always get what you want," that's a wrap for his Ohio rally, the 34th MAGA rally since he took office.
Trump goes on at length with a history lesson about Ohioan Ulysses Grant, &amp; says, "He's finally being recognized as a great general."	Civil War books were literally my hobby as an Ohio child in the '60s. There was no shortage of 'em depicting Grant as a great general.
Now Trump's attacking Dem senators who opposed Kavanaugh. His OH crowd seems not to know who "DaNang Dick" is. He moves to Cory Booker, then Dianne Feinstein, mocking her denials that she leaked Christine Blasey Ford's allegation of BK's sexual assault. "Lock her up" some yell.
@Noahbierman "Now you finally have a president who is standing up for America," Trump tells the OH rally.	[Chants of "USA!"]		He segues to attacking the media at rear. As usual he complains cameras focus on him to avoid showing the big crowd.	 I'm watching on FOX website. It's focused on him.

After saying media makes up quotes &amp; stories, Trump acknowledges that maybe some aides &amp; ex-aides have leaked actual facts: 	"Gary Cohn -- I could tell you stories about him that you wouldn't believe."
"How frustrating is that for you?" the Fox &amp; Friends chirps in reply to the president.
Trump suggests there are no leaks from his administration, only made-up stories in the media.
"Honestly, I'm doing a great job," Trump tells Fox &amp; Friends, 42 minutes into this rambling interview.
Watching this Trump Fox &amp; Friends interview, at 36 mins &amp; counting, is like watching a MAGA rally without the crowd and the "Lock Her Up" chants. Same lines, boasts, factual errors, attacks. Hosts having a hard time controlling the thing as he goes on &amp; on.

Well, that confirms that Trump's "official" visit to the police chiefs' convention was actually political -- as soon as he finished in Orlando, the organizers struck up the campaign closer, the Rolling Stones' "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
Trump's dropped the nuance: He specifically attacks Dems in this "official" taxpayer-funded visit to police chiefs convention: 	When it comes to funding, he says, "The Democrats fight us at every turn, whether it's military or law enforcement."
Trump, in "official" speech to the police chiefs, attacks the media &amp; gestures to draw attn to the riser of reporters--just as he does at political rallies. Gets biggest applause yet. 	Says US loves police but, pointing to reporters, repeats, "You don't hear it from the media."
Trump, at "official" speech to the police chiefs convention, says Kavanaugh was a victim of "false charges, false accusations....It was a disgraceful situation brought about by people who are evil...And I have to thank the Republican senators..."
Trump opens at police chiefs convention by saying when it comes to federal funds, law enforcement gets anything it wants.	Local communities are still waiting for 100s of millions of $$ in federal subsidies for law enforcement.

Trump's mocking a list of Dems he says might run against him in '20.	Of Eliz Warren: “I’ve got more Indian blood in me than Pocahontas and I have none.” 	Of Biden, he recalls ex-VP's quip once of going mano-a-mano: 	"I would love that. He wouldn't last long."	MAGA crowd loves it.
Trump called GOP House candidate Steve Watkins to the stage--a man who's repeatedly been caught making false claims about himself. One county GOP chmn said, “If we come to find out that stuff’s true and he’s really not what he says he is, we’ll replace him in two years, I guess.”
Now Trump's mocking Sen. Dianne Feinstein, and calling her "Leaking Dianne" for leaking Christine Blasey Ford's allegation against Kavanaugh, which Feinstein has repeatedly denied.	The MAGA crowd boos immediately just at the mention of her name.

This is a new line for Trump, delivered at tonight's MAGA rally -- his 4th this week -- in Topeka KS. https://t.co/Xwaz4oeK8H
"What a job he did for me, what a job he did for me," Trump says of Kris Kobach, who headed Trump's failed, disbanded voter-fraud task force. 	Trump jokes that he hopes Kobach loses his race for KS governor so Trump can give him an administration job.
Kris Kobach, GOP's candidate  for governor, now on stage with Trump in Topeka, is now actually boasting of his work against voter fraud. This is the man who headed Trump's voter-fraud task force that was disbanded without finding fraud, despite spending plenty of taxpayer $$.
And Trump tells reporters his mocking of Dr. Blasey Ford at a MS rally helped Kavanaugh get confirmed:	“I think that the MS speech had a great impact, yes. I think it was a very important thing. Hey look, the Washington Post said it on their front page."
More Trump on AF1: "I think the Republicans are going to do great in the midterms. I think we have a momentum that hasn’t been seen in years. When you hear those screamers in Congress today, the screaming that – you see how orchestrated it is, how phony it is."
More Trump, to reporters on AF1: "One of the reasons I chose him is because there is nobody with a squeaky clean past like Brett Kavanaugh."
Trump tells reporters on AF1 that women were "in many ways stronger than the men in [Kavanaugh's] favor. So you have a lot of women that are extremely happy...Because they’re thinking of their sons, they’re thinking of their husbands and their brothers, their uncles, and others."

@All_American_4U "Christian minded. Very caring"? Have I looked for it? I not only covered Congress for years, I have close friends who worked for him for years. I would know. Trump has slandered the man.
Here it is -- Trump making fun of Christine Blasey Ford before 1000s of Mississippians, who laugh and clap.	Four days ago, after she testified, Trump called her “very compelling" and "a very credible witness." https://t.co/o284hGNpak
He's suggesting that many Democrats having drinking problems. Says look up "Patrick Leahy-slash-drink" and repeats, "Patrick Leahy-dash-drink."	FWIW -- In 3+ decades watching Congress, I've never heard a hint of such talk about Leahy.
Trump got to the part where he attacks Hillary Clinton -- it's now nearly 2 years since the election -- and on cue the Mississippi crowd is chanting "Lock her up." 	Amazing that chant's still going strong even as Trump's associates are drawing prison sentences.
Trump brings up to the stage Cindy Hyde-Smith, the appointed Mississippi senator now seeking election. 	She calls Trump the greatest president the US has ever had.	And she asks the crowd "to pray for the Kavanaugh family."
@Tohard008 you're wrong. I was quoting from the White House pool report. Your version makes no sense -- he wouldn't call Medicare "socialist Medicare."
Trump is using the Kavanaugh allegations to his own advantage -- "I've had so many false accusations...They can say anything they want and you can't sue them because you can't sue if you're famous."
Trump is warning his Mississippi audience to fear for the men &amp; boys in their families -- that their lives could be destroyed if some women suddenly accuses them of sexual misconduct. 	"Think of your son! Think of your husband!" 	The white men behind him nod in agreement.
Now Trump is assailing "that sleezebag lawyer Aviante."	He means Avenatti of course
Trump is making fun of Christine Blasey Ford's testimony before 1000s of people at a political rally in Mississippi -- denigrating her claims she only had 1 beer, doesn't know who drove her to party or home, on and on. 	So much for his earlier claim she was a good witness.

Trump: "I don't think he did" lie about his drinking.
And now Trump has returned to CNN's Kaitlin Collins, who'd remained standing since he first shut her down. She asked whether it would be disqualifying if it's found Kavanaugh lied about his drinking.	Trump says "there are bad reports on everybody in here...except for Mike Pence."
Trump says of Kavanaugh's 3rd accuser that he's "heard she has very little credibility. I have no idea if this is true."
To Trump's credit, he did return to the reporter, ABC's Celia Vega. And she asked her Kavanaugh question. 		In reply he reiterated his sympathy for Kavanaugh &amp; said "the Senate is making this decision" as to scope of FBI probe.
...but the reporter asked if Trump had pressed Mexico, in the trade talks, on his demand Mexico would pay for 'the wall.' He said yes, but then went on to describe $1.6 billion -- that's US taxpayers' money, and it doesn't all cover wall construction/repair. https://t.co/x7cdqr3l6a
Trump just shut down another female reporter, CNN's Kaitlin Collins, for asking him not about trade but about the Kavanaugh probe. She's still standing, as he went to another reporter who asked about 'the wall' with Mexico--not trade. He's answering this one.
Trump then refused to answer her question, which was whether he was limiting the FBI probe of Kavanaugh	Said she had to ask about trade, that he'd come back to her FBI question later. Hope she's not holding her breath. https://t.co/peZa02X0W3

Trump on allegations against Kavanaugh -- "Women are very angry ... I have women that are incensed at what's going on."		He repeats the falsehood that he was elected with a majority of women's votes, 52%. Not true. He's talking only about white women, leaves out the word "white."
"If I wasn't elected, you'd be in a war...President Obama thought you had to have a war."		Somehow Obama didn't get around to starting a new war in 2 terms, 8 years.
Trump: "I've been a famous person for a very long time...I've had many false charges" of sexual assault. 		This from the man who famously said that, as a celebrity, he's been free to "grab" women's genitals -- i.e., sexually assault women.
Trump says "I've been accused, I've been accused, false accusations...I was accused by four or five women who got paid lots of money..."
Kudos to @HallieJackson for asking 2 questions that Trump didn't answer when other reporters asked them. 1) Is he calling all the Kavanaugh accusers "liars"? and 2) Why does he always take the accused man's side? 	Unfortunately, she didn't really get answers either.
"I wasn't happy with Roy Moore. Let's get that straight," Trump says.	Now that's Fake News -- he endorsed and stood by the Ala Republican after allegations of sexual assault against girls.
"They laugh like hell," Trump says twice of Democrats, as he repeats that the allegations against Kavanaugh are nothing but "a big fat con job."
HUH?	Trump in press conf just now first said of China, "They would like to see me lose and election."		A minute later: "I have a great relationship with the president of China, President Xi."

Under penalty of perjury, Christine Blasey Ford's husband swears she told him in 2012 that Kavanaugh assaulted her. Pretty smart of Democrats plotting their future "con" against his future SCOTUS nomination to get her to do that way back then.
Reminder: For much of Obama administration, after Dems' 1st-yr stimulus, GOP in Congress forced a fiscal policy of deep spending cuts despite Fed's repeated critiques that it was a drag on the economy &amp; hence the recovery.

At IN rally, Trump turns to his attacks on "the elites" and adds, "I'm president and they're not."

Trump's reviving the claim that ICE "is liberating towns" from MS-13's control, that gangs run whole towns. Never says where. Because they don't exist.
Trump tells IN rally he's polling higher among Republicans than Lincoln did. He said he's asked if there were polls then &amp; didn't get an answer, but assumes that there were polls. Seriously? In 1865?
"Look what she's getting away with," Trump says of Hillary Clinton to rally crowd. More chants of "lock her up."
Trump boasts at IN rally of 4.2% growth in qtr &amp; says if Dems had won, "you would have seen some real negative numbers."	Growth exceeded 4.2% in four qtrs under Obama, who inherited the worst recession since the Depression.
Still early in this Indiana rally, but the crowd's chanting "Lock her up."
Yet again in Indiana Trump tells a rally crowd to watch as red lights go on the TV cameras covering him, as they tune out his attacks on press. Not so, as anyone watching it on TV can tell. (who ya gonna believe, Trump or your lying eyes?)
"These are just dishonest, terrible people," Trump says, pointing toward reporters within first minutes of his Indiana rally. 	This on a day the FBI arrested an armed man threatening to kill Boston Globe reporters, calling them "enemies of the people" &amp; invoking Mueller.

What's not appropriate: Trump went all the way to Ft. Drum to sign the McCain defense bill before a military crowd &amp; never mentioned McCain to pay this tribute.

Trump, at Fort Drum to sign defense bill, lauded two GOP reps--Stefanik, now fighting for reelection, &amp; McSally, seeking AZ Senate seat. But AZ Sen. John McCain, the dying war hero for whom the bill is named, gets no mention. No president of either party would've done that.
Trump's speech before active-duty military at Ft. Drum is something of a campaign pitch for local Rep. Stefanik. But he mispronounces her name repeatedly.

Trump, who as a candidate said China "raped" the US, now at his PA rally resurrects his line that China's not to blame for lost jobs: "It's not their fault that our leaders were stupid."
"The women liked me, you know? They liked me." -- Trump just now at his Wilkes-Barre PA rally
Trump's anti-NATO rant at this PA rally is perhaps his longest &amp; most falsehood-filled yet. He says it only benefits Europe. 	Yet he's near the crash-site memorial to Flight 93-- a reminder that the ONLY time NATO invoked its mutual defense Art. 5 was FOR the US, after  9/11

Orwell's "1984" was dystopian fiction.	This is reality, Trump-style: Today he told the VFW convention, "And just remember -- what you're seeing &amp; what you're reading is not what's happening."
This is an affront to farmers. https://t.co/9EOBHVMY2N
After Trump spoke to VFW's convention, it said in a statement: "We were disappointed to hear some of our members boo the press." Reporters "were our invited guests &amp; we rely on them to help spread the VFW's message."		It didn't mention Trump's press attack that provoked the boos.
"Prisoners of War"?	In July 2015, candidate Trump sneered in Iowa that John McCain's years as a POW didn't make him a war hero: "I like people who weren’t captured.” https://t.co/nA9M2xYKG2
At VFW, Trump intro'd GOP Sen candidate Josh Hawley as "hopefully your new senator-to-be."	Hawley tells vets, "Thanks to all of you for your service...But how about the leadership of Pres Donald Trump?...When I think about Pres Trump, there's 1 word that comes to mind...courage."
Now Trump is getting the VFW convention to boo Nancy Pelosi, "Low IQ Maxine Waters" and Democrats who oppose ICE. "We're going to have a lot of fun running against that in 2020."		This isn't an official event; it's a Trump political rally (tho the place is only half-full).
Keeping up his partisanship at the ostensibly nonpartisan VFW convention, Trump tells the vets that Democrats want crime and open borders.	All taxpayers are paying for the president's Kansas City trip because this is supposedly an 'official' event.
“Don’t believe the crap you see from these people, the fake news," Trump tells VFW convention. Vets there turn toward press section, point and boo.
Nonsense: Trump tells VFW we lost $817 billion in trade last year.  If he's referring to trade deficit, his number is wrong...but it represents products US consumers bought. They/we didn't "lose," we bought stuff.		Trump's hurting the brand for Wharton degrees.
Three years ago, July 2015 in Iowa:	“He’s not a war hero,” Trump said of McCain. “He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured.”
He's just thanked the VFW for its support of POWs -- this from the man who said of McCain in 2015 that he prefers those who "don't get captured."
Now Trump's telling the vets his false story about how much money he saved by building the Jerusalem embassy (the US rehabbed an existing bldg, but it's also bldg a costly new one).
And now he's invited the Republican Senate candidate, Josh Hawley, to the stage. Hawley delivers a spirited tribute to Trump, said Trump "needs political reinforcements in DC."	I've attended VFW conventions w/3 other presidents -- never saw this level of partisanship. https://t.co/E91SpAehdF

Trump closes Fargo rally by adding this to his usual MAGA ending: "We will make America LOVING again!"
@Mattwoodnyc3 Read the indictments. The charges describe behavior thru 2016. Manafort's reputation was well known long before that in GOP circles--for Trump to claim he'd "drain the swamp," putting a swamp creature in charge of his campaign wasn't a good sign.
Presidential profanity of the night (so far) -- Trump tells Fargo rally crowd (which includes lots of kids) that "slovenly" Rep. Joe Crowley "got his ass kicked."
Trump, who slams Clinton at every rally nearly 2 yrs after election, asks his Fargo ND crowd, "When is she going to get over it??"	The crowd chants "Lock 'er up." 	(P.S. -- Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort just lost his bid for release from jail.)
Trump at Fargo ND rally: "I said, I am so smart, I am the smartest person."
The Constitution says nada about waiting until after elections to fill Court seats. But if McConnell Rule is the standard, shouldn't matter if it's presidential or midterm election: Senate's power to "advise &amp; consent" is equal to president's to nominate, under the Constitution.
Sen. McConnell announces "the Senate stands ready to fulfill its constitutional role" &amp; will quickly hold meetings &amp; hearings with Trump's SCOTUS nominee &amp; vote "in the fall" -- that would be the constitutional role he didn't have the Senate fulfill with Merrick Garland.
McConnell announces "The Senate stands ready to fulfill its constitutional role" and will move swiftly to have hearings, meetings with Trump's SCOTUS nominee, and vote "in the fall"  -- Somehow he wasn't ready to fulfill that role with unlike  Merrick Garland --
All the Democrats/progressives who sat out elections in non-presidential years, complacent that Roe v Wade was settled law (even as anti-abortion forces prioritized voting with SCOTUS in mind), should now see the error of their ways.

The blowback against Trump's family-splitting policy will be at least matched when his DACA repeal is taken to its obvious end: Deportation of young people who've been in this country for many years, working, going to school &amp; knowing no other home.	He's using both for leverage.

@Brian_Riedl @BBKogan @BudgetBen I love it, and I'm enlightened by it. I'd weigh in more but occasionally I have to do my day job.
@Brian_Riedl Democrats generally haven't aspired to balance budgets, only to keep annual deficits low--below the 3% of GDP that most economists consider fine in a growing economy. That was Obama's goal, which was met.
@Brian_Riedl Those plans never would have passed in Congress or been signed into law. Ryan never sought to flesh out the details or put them into legislative language, knowing the details of his proposed cuts in Medicare/Medicaid growth (w/tax cuts) would never fly with Rs -- forget Dems.
Ryan blocked last, best chances for longterm bipartisan budget deal: All 3 Sen Rs on 2010 Simpson-Bowles commission voted for a plan; Ryan led 3 House Rs in opposing--depriving it of the votes needed to send plan to House &amp; Senate.

This hateful tweet on Passover/Easter weekend is from the chairwoman of the Republican Party. On any weekend, this sentiment would cross this line, but on this one???? https://t.co/YTBcsltJyz
Hey evangelicals, while you’re observing Holy Saturday, the president you back has just posted his 3rd political attack tweet of the morning https://t.co/uYSQEUE7ZN
The example for nepotism is set at the top of the administration. https://t.co/oCDOwIRoCl
Hey evangelicals: This is what POTUS tweets on Holy Saturday/Passover—another dig at Amazon (and by extension Bezos and the Washington Post) https://t.co/jGTkfkWJVK
RT @EricLiptonNYT: In any other administration in the modern history of Washington, this would be a major scandal. But, then again, I have…
Trump in Ohio yesterday re Wall: "That's what I do is I build. I was always very good at building. It was always my best thing. I think better than being president, I was maybe good at building...	You have to be able to see who's on the other side. Nobody would even think of it." https://t.co/rdXVkE4sR9
@mjpetee You're 'handle' is suspiciously spare. But you know so much about me I had to figure you're no bot! I do remember the name. And congrats!
23. Trump's hwy to nowhere:	"The road is no longer a straight shot. It's now not good if you're not feeling so good behind the wheel. Got to make another turn. They had to take care of all the nesting. It's cost a lot of money &amp; took many yrs. It's out of control." 	 --The End--
22. Ending this annotation of Trump's unhinged remarks in Ohio Thursday with one of his many head-scratching quotes. This one is on his alleged topic -- infrastructure -- from which he often detoured. It's about some long-planned highway under construction. See #23....
21. Trump's 2nd bit of out-of-the-blue policy-making in OH dealt with a newly revised trade deal w/S Korea:	"I may hold it up 'til after a [nuke] deal is made with N Korea. Does everybody understand that?..It's a very strong card &amp; I want to make sure everyone is treated fairly."
20. Trump's OH remarks also had memorable examples of policy-making on the fly, to advisers' shock.	"We'll be coming out of Syria, like very soon. Let the other people take care of it now...We're going to have 100% of the caliphate as they call it--sometimes referred to as land."
19. Trump's falsehood(s) #5 in Ohio had to do with health care &amp; his supposed better, cheaper alternative to "Obamacare," but his remarks were too garbled to parse. 	He also praised his Sec of Labor who was there, for an "incredible" job on health care. ??
18. A 4th falsehood in Trump OH remarks: he took credit for gun controls that haven't happened yet.	"We fixed, very strongly, the background checks. We got rid of the bump stocks."
17. A 3rd falsehood in Trump's OH remarks: He said a respected Democrat said "we should get rid of our 2nd Amdt." He was referring to ex-Justice John Paul Stevens, who wrote op-ed to that effect. Stevens was a Republican, named to federal courts by Presidents Nixon and Ford.
16. Another falsehood in Trump's OH speech: a 2nd reference to 3 mil jobs created since his election. "If you would have said, '3 mil jobs,' they would have said--the fake news--'he's exaggerating.'"	Exaggerating? 3m is slightly behind pace of Obama years post-recession. (See #6)
15. After Trump's falsehood about his border wall construction, there was this quote worth keeping:	"That's what I do is I build. I was always very good at building. It was always my best thing. I think better than being president, I was maybe good at building."
14. Besides Trump's partisanship, his "official" remarks in OH were notable for some untruths.	THE WALL: "You saw the pictures," he said. "I said, what a thing of beauty..we're getting that sucker built."	FACT: Pix showed a replacement fence begun in '09.	https://t.co/2u0ng3hr0t
