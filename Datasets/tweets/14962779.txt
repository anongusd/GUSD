Went to #gridirondinner2019 last night. Faux folksy senator John Kennedy of Louisiana summed up the event, in which journalists don white tie to hobnob with leading politicians, cabinet secretaries and WH staff. “Always be yourself,” he advised the crowd, “unless you suck.”
Doubt he prays. https://t.co/KhTUvSrvdu
The irony: perhaps only the visibility of the presidency could have fully exposed the 50-year long con known as the #Trump “real-estate empire.” His vain decision to run may become the ultimate proof of the adage: Be careful what you wish for, because you might get it.”
Apologies: #MATTHEWCalamari, not Michael. It’s the former, bouncer-sized guy who is known fondly within the Trump Family as “The Big Squid.”
I love that the #Trump inner circle called bodyguard/“COO” #michaelcalimari “The Big Squid.” The grifters Trump gathered around him — Cohen, Stone, Pecker, Jared etc — are straight out of Jimmy Breslin by way of Woodward and Bernstein, with a touch of William Shirer thrown in.
We’ll be reporting on and talking about latest in the ever-growing list of #Trump investigations on @TheBeatWithAri with...@AriMelber tonight at 6.
The roadmap runs through #Weisselberg.  https://t.co/1O8LwzD8Nx
I attended lots of campaign rallies for @realDonaldTrump. In sum, his voters thought he was a rich, unbought NY guy who, therefore, could be the voice and anvil of their non-PC (or outright bigoted) fears about race, immigration, gender, family, abortion and the power of govt. https://t.co/SU3Sg9UnYK
Once we get a close-up view, via testimony in open hearings, of the inner circle of #TrumpWorld — #Cohen, #Jared, #Weisselberg, #Pecker, #Ivanka, #Schiller et al — the conclusion may be that the American people accidentally elevated an underworld crime boss to the presidency.
FYI, For those of you wondering — and I know you’re out there — @AOC will turn 35 years old (and thus be old enough to legally be president) during the 2024 election season.
Before #AndrePrevin arrived in my hometown of #Pittsburgh, classical music lovers had for decades been fed a starchy diet of the Three Bs: Bach, Beethoven and Brahms. Previn lightened, brightened and modernized the repertoire of the city's superb symphony orchestra. Cool dude.
Don’t look at #SDNY and #Mueller probes as separate. They share info. And a key to any collusion and/or coverup case is @realDonaldTrump’s motivation and intent. SDNY’s role is to see if #Russian money was/is the driving force: debts, money laundering, blackmail vulnerability.
Yes, I know. But given the legal quicksand — and his centrality to the whole operation — he as well as the prosecutors have incentive to expand their relationship. I bet they already have. https://t.co/yT8HclSBzQ
.@AOC, @AyannaPressley and @RashidaTlaib. If you want a picture of how America can and will change -- as it always does, over time and never easily -- here's one, from the #CohenCongressionalHearing. https://t.co/9WEPLNuU4Y
The #Cohen hearing was disturbing partly because of demographic, geographic and cultural division. To oversimplify slightly: a #GOP comprising Southern, Midwestern and rural-rooted white men v. #Dems comprising everybody else. The contrast gets more dangerous with each election.
#ElijahCummings handled it very well. He happens to be a terrific guy. I’ve been lucky to interview him and write about him: a great American story. https://t.co/MeGixCKhXO
.⁦@MeredithFineman⁩ leading her annual Women Writing Washington conference last weekend. She’s a terrific writer and biz woman. https://t.co/IfOftu5sW4
Let me rephrase: Some historians say that #AndrewJohnson was impeached more for his rotten personal character than for any specific illegal or impeachable acts. He was simply an especially rotten apple who came to be seen by most of the country as horribly unfit for the office.
Sounds like @DonaldJTrumpJr might be the next loafer to drop.
What was impressive about @AOC today was not just her substantive, detailed questioning, but also the shrewd, in-it-for-the-long-haul political good sense she showed in taking that approach. She’s a 29-year-old rookie!
I’ll add that, at the end of the hearing, as the last Democrats got their turns, @AOC’s questioning was focused, detailed and useful to the investigative process — far better than the speechifying and name calling of some others. She continues to be very impressive. She’s gifted.
As others have noted, the #GOP members of the committee mounted virtually NO substantive defense of @realDonaldTrump.
By carefully saying that he is not alleging collusion with #Russia; that @realDonaldTrump did not “directly” ask him to lie to Congress; and that Trump would never hit #Melania, #MichaelCohen is trying to show that he’s sticking to the facts.
So #ChipRoy is arguing that, by calling #MichaelCohen, the #Democrats are allowing drug cartels to send criminals into the United States.
#MichaelCohen just said he lied to #Melania in a phone call about #StormyDaniels to protect the Boss.
#MichaelCohen’s sporadically argumentative attempts to save a shred of honor aren’t doing him any good. The #GOP strategy obviously is to get him to explode — and he’s getting close. But in the meantime, sometimes by accident, he’s landing blow after blow on @realDonaldTrump.
#ClayHiggins! Straight out of @TrueDetective.
The May 2017 WH meeting with @realDonaldTrump and Jay Sekulow that #MichaelCohen just testified to is an explosive key to an obstruction case.
My wife, Amy Nathan, just posted on Facebook a beautiful eulogy for her late uncle, Joseph Leucht Nathan, who died yesterday at the age 96. He was the brilliant, cultured patriarch of our family. 		https://t.co/Lubz2Dpt7o
You can see at the hearing why @realDonaldTrump risked using #MichaelCohen. He’s showing himself to be a sleazy hot head who’d have no trouble credibly threatening people. On the other hand, he dived to the depths with #Trump and has surfaced with damning details and documents.
#Trump ally Rep. Gaetz threatens Michael Cohen ahead of public hearing - POLITICO.  Even by the fetid standards of #TrumpWorld,  this guy’s disgusting. In #Gaetz, Trump’s allies managed to hoist from the muck someone even more scummy than #MichaelCohen. https://t.co/ymQuBMun4s

Y’all won’t like this, but here it is:  #AndrewMcCabe book tour is HELPING @realDonaldTrump politically. McCabe’s claim that #Rosenstein talked about using the 25th Amt to remove Trump (a claim not in the book) is gasoline on the fire of the fake but potent “witch hunt”narrative.
So: @realDonaldTrump sent the Army to the border as a political act, when there was no hostile  military threat. Now he’s using the presence of troops (and the need to literally fortify them) to justify stealing cash for his wall in the name of a trumped-up “national emergency.”
They know how to reach me. https://t.co/4VzuguwafI
This is war: @realDonaldTrump says #McCabe committed “treason;” McCabe says it’s “possible” Trump’s a “Russian asset.” These are the president and former acting #FBI director talking!! We’re getting close to political Armageddon. Or mass-hallucination theater. It’s #Mueller time!

.@realDonaldTrump WANTS the confrontation with the federal courts. He’ll run in 2020 against the judges or blame them for his short little wall.
Does @realDonaldTrump view this as his Enabling Act? Does he think the Constitution mean anything? Does he know that a president swears centrally to protect and defend the CONSTITUTION?
.@senatemajldr, who is up for re-election in 2020, advertises himself as a small-government conservative. He fails utterly in a key moment of his career.

Now all the Hill negotiators have to do is convince @realDonaldTrump that the deal includes money for some form of....you know what. It’s what they call in theater studies “the suspension of disbelief.” Trump has to be tricked — or will himself — into believing he’s won big time.
Here’s the thing: @realDonaldTrump thinks that he IS putting in long hours “working.” But that’s because he also thinks that his “job” consists entirely of tweeting out brags and insults; watching TV; and yakking on the phone with people he knows will tell him how great he is.

I was getting incipiently ratio’d for suggesting @realDonaldTrump’s #SOTU did pretty well in the viewer polls and accomplished his main political objective. I took it down cuz people righty noted that such polls of #Trump are garbage: Too many people can’t stand the sight of him.
Tactically, @realDonaldTrump’s #SOTU was aimed at @senatemajldr and other #GOP senators who claim they’ll oppose a declaration of national emergency to build the wall. Trump amped up the horror stories and threats, got big numbers from GOP viewers, and dared Mitch to block him.

I gotta say, @realDonaldTrump has dipped into every jar of schmaltz that exists in politics, going back to D-Day, and slathered it all over this desperately ingratiating speech. He’s doing a weird, bizzaro sampling of Ronald Reagan riffs. Sad!
Only a #yinzer would shout back from the gallery.
Of course @realDonaldTrump followed that by proposing a ban on “late term” abortion. That produced the starkest visual division in the room, with all the white-clad women, who’d just been cheering and cheered, glumly remaining seated as they instantly remembered the work ahead.
A genuine, improbable moment of bipartisan pride in the economic/political progress of women. .@realDonaldTrump didn’t get the joke: he was why so many women got jobs as members of Congress! Still, chamber-wide cheers of “USA” for them were a rare sign of health in public life.
#RickPerry is the designated survivor. Oouups.
.@realDonaldTrump frets he gets no credit for a strong economy. Why? 1. It was chugging under #Obama 2. His giant tax cut should’ve been fair and/or saved for recessionary times 3. Vast new US debt 4. Growing income inequality. 5. Climate and worker-crushing regulatory “relief.”

This is arguably impeachable conduct. Yes, #Trump has wide latitude to conduct foreign and military affairs, but it isn’t limitless. Treason’s a declared-war issue, so not applicable. But is his feckless lassitude (at best) with #Putin et al a high crime?  https://t.co/ElL8D8UMpu

.@senatemajldr says blocking #MerrickGarland is “the most consequential thing I’ve ever done.” True. He destroyed what was left of bipartisanship; helped @realDonaldTrump win by making the Court central in 2016; and jammed through Scalia clones by further diminishing the Senate.

The only thing @senatemajldr cares about besides getting re-elected and packing the courts is the power of the Senate, which includes control of the budget. A @realDonaldTrump declaration of “national emergency” undercuts that. Does Mitch have the guts to fight it?
.@realDonaldTrump doesn’t understand that being president means you can’t say “bye bye.” This isn’t a real estate deal in NY where you can just walk away. You’ve got a government to run and that’s, like, permanent and has unending responsibilities to the country and it’s people.
Bridge too far :) https://t.co/xOaZ0gk2dg
.@realDonaldTrump must’ve found @senatemajldr’s response to his big speech too tepid. Last night Mitch avoided using the word “wall; just now on the Senate floor, he did. Mitch fears — knows — that Trump could destroy him in KY by backing a 2020 #GOP primary challenge.

Come to think of it, if @realDonaldTrump loses in 2020, he could leave the Inauguration ceremony at the Capitol on Jan.20, 2021 and move directly into a perp walk.
If #DOJ and/or #Supremes decide that a sitting president can’t be indicted for, say, paying off @StormyDaniels, then voters who don’t like @realDonaldTrump will have an especially specific, punitive reason to turn out in 2020: to hasten the day he would face criminal prosecution.

.@steelers’s leadership has taken a very talented team (which could have been more talented) and a great franchise and turned it this year into a dumpster fire. Only the ineptitude of the division can allow them to make the playoffs, where they are almost certain to get crushed.
If @realDonaldTrump wanted to pick a competent, level-headed person of good character to be #WhiteHouse COS— as opposed to a craven sycophant, conniving kid or angry old tackling dummy — he has an obvious, presumably available choice: #BobLighthizer. (This may kill his chances).

From what I’m told, @realDonaldTrump is right up to a point: The Office of the President WAS shown great respect. That’s as it must be, and why Rabbi Myers was there with the Trumps at #TreeofLife. The deeper question: whether #TRUMP is showing the Office great respect — or any. https://t.co/ISQOtdydcs
Right now we can turn to #MLK. A friend reminded me of this: “Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.” I beg you not dismiss this as naive in these times. It is life-or-death that we find leaders like Martin.

BTW, in @realDonaldTrump lexicon, someone is “weak” if they refuse to humiliate themselves in his service.
Top WH official tells me #PA #GovTomWolf is “weak” for refusing to appear in #Pittsburgh with @realDonaldTrump. But Wolf and other Dems declined in tandem. So did every Republican WH asked. no one in either party  wanted to barge into town with Trump, especially during funerals.
Further: @realDonaldTrump WH called the top #PA and #Pittsburgh officials one at a time and lied to each that the others had agreed. WH did the same to #Schumer and #Pelosi. No one bit. WH also trying to push #Trump into hospital rooms of victims but most want no part of him.

Just checked with sources in #Pittsburgh: the mayor, county executive and governor will NOT accompany or meet with @realDonaldTrump as he and Melania visit the city as families bury their dead after the #TreeofLife massacre. The WH tried to force officials hand with false leaks.
Writing and tv work done for now, all I can think about is my late parents, who taught at #TreeofLife to give my sister and me a deeper grounding in Jewish identity to blend with our faith in America’s promise. They’d be heartbroken, but would never abandon hope. Neither will I. https://t.co/kPa9VDWh8u

I’m not sure that there’s been a more deadly attack on a synagogue in America. Or this kind of mass shooting in #Pittsburgh. And it happened in #SquirrelHill, one of the safest, quietest, most pleasant, city communities in the nation. No one is safe, no one is immune. Anywhere.

.@realDonaldTrump blames the media for bomb sent to the media. That statement, in itself, is an incitement to riot — that is, to send a bomb to the media. The media must (dramatically) cover the attack, sounding a frightened alarm, thus inevitably stimulating more bombs to media.
A very good catch but hardly miraculous. He’s left handed running to his right... athletic yes, spectacular no.
I’ve known @JoeBiden and written about him for decades.

Leading @Twitter reaction to my previous tweet: suspicion that @realDonaldTrump or, more surely, #JaredKushner, knew of or green-lighted the hit on #JamalKhashoggi—if for no other reason than to assure their own lifetime access to #Saudi funds. Well, my patriot-readers are TOUGH.
#MBS just purged his intel and ops team, blaming them for #Khashoggi murder. They won’t be jailed at Ritz-Carlton; it may be bone saw time. In the U.S., the question is whether @realDonaldTrump has the guts or moral fiber to be a true world leader or just an enabler of brutality.

Pattern: #realDonaldTrump in #MT praises a local @GOP   congressman who admitted to body-slamming a reporter. #Trump whips rallies into a frenzy of hatred for the press corps covering them. He coddles a Saudi thug/sheik who had a defiant journalist hacked to bits with a bone saw.

It’s both devastating and inspiring to read #JamalKhashoggi’s final column for @washingtonpost. It’s a plea for free press and free flow of information in the #Arab world.
The #Saudi royals helped bail out the failing @realDonaldTrump in the ‘90s; they remained involved thereafter. That’s not why he’s shielding them now — it’s arms sales, oil, Saudi Investment Fund’s clout and anti-Iran maneuvering — but the history further corrodes US standing.
As you follow the murder of journo #Khashoggi, remember that a free press and free inquiry are the essence of our American Idea and of rational humanism. No “strongman” in the West since WWII has cultivated an atmosphere of contempt for those ideals the way @realDonaldTrump has.

Yes Mr. President, the press corps is “loco.” We have this insane belief that those elected by the people to positions of public trust should tell the truth. That’s not naive, fanciful or partisan. Our system—freedom, the rule of law and self-government—cannot otherwise survive.
.@realDonaldTrump never disappoints.
The @FedSoc, decades in the making, led by a group that includes #DonMcGahn, @senatemajldr and  #BrettKavanaugh, is the most powerful legal force in the US since the civil rights era and a counter-revolution to it. Getting Kavanaugh, shrewd politician, on the court is the summit.

The flawed #Kavanaugh hearing worked in one sense. It showed him as he really is: a hot-tempered, ferociously ambitious political warrior who honed his gut fighter skills in Yale’s Federalist Society, Ken Starr’s jihad and the Bush-Cheney White House. He’s a ward boss in robes.
Did @LindseyGrahamSC scarce the bejeezus out of #JeffFlake, #SusanCollins, #LisaMurkowski and the others? Did he scare #JoeManchin, too? This hearing was more desperate on both sides than either #Bork or #ClarenceThomas.
A confirmation hearing first: the weak-stomach defense coupled with the beer-drinker offense.
One-man #Trump rally. https://t.co/tYJaHwpMbx
The fact that @SenSasse is wailing on the #Democrats here is significant — and bad news for those who oppose #Kavanaugh.
#BrettKavanaugh complains that the last ten days he’s been in hell. If you believe #chrstineblaseyford, she’s been in hell for the last 36 years.
As he works himself up into a righteous, put-upon, faux working man fit, #BrettKavanaugh reminds me of a young #PatBuchanan. It’s the same brilliant and belligerent culture.
Again: WHERE IS #MARKJUDGE?? How can they vote without hearing from him?
The son of a well-off and well-connected cosmetics lobbyist, who grew up in a fancy suburb and attended a well-endowed prep school, is portraying himself as a humble blue-collar beer drinker. He’s trying to turn the hearing into a #Trump rally.

#BrettKavanaugh has managed to make the questions about the yearbook etc look, well, juvenile.
Bravura lead off performance playing victim by #BrettKavanaugh, frantically working alone to save his nomination. #DiFi missed a huge opportunity to pin him down on an FBI investigation.
#BrettKavanaugh, comin’ in hot....
#LindseyGraham says he feels “ambushed.” Right. Talk to #MerrickGarland.
The silence of all the @GOP on the Senate Judiciary Committee spoke volumes about their timidity. They hid behind #RachelMitchell, who was put into  an impossible position.
The longer this #BrettKavanaugh hearing goes on, the clearer it is that this is a pivotal moment — in the OPPOSITE direction from the results of the #ClarenceThomas v #AnitaHill events of long ago. It’s a generational and political changing of the guard.
The “prosecutor” just spent a ton of time trying to raise suspicions about how #ChristineBlaseyFord will pay for her polygraph and other expenses, only to be face-planted — and silenced — by the shocking revelation Ford is relying on GoFundMe sites.
By #ChristineBlaseyFord’s account, the get together that led to the assault happened spontaneously after a day at “the club” — which would explain why #BrettKavanaugh’s calendars are totally irrelevant.
#ChristineBlaseyFord was pretty credible, too, on the question of her reluctance to come forward at all, let alone publicly.
Yep. https://t.co/xd8bYGgaEV
The @GOP argument is that, yes she was assaulted, but even if it was #BrettKavanaugh who did it, #ChristineBlaseyFord is a political co-conspirator with Democrats and therefore her allegations should not matter to the confirmation. That argument will work with the base — only.
The “prosecutor” in the #BrettKavanaugh hearing is asking a series of inconsequential questions about process and staying a million miles away from the incident — and for good reason: #ChristineBlaseyFord’s account and demeanor came off as utterly credible. .@GOP defense is weak.
#ChristineBlaseyFord is both a witness and an expert witness at the same time. Remarkable.
“100 percent.”
“Deeply problematic for him,” says @megynkelly of #ChristineBlaseyFord’s testimony.
“Indelible in the hippocampus.”
This could not be a case of mistaken identity? “Absolutely not.”
“I am no one’s pawn.” #ChristineBlaseyFord
And yes, #JoeManchin. He could save #BrettKavanaugh, and would become a Trumpworld hero if he does.
The only three viewers who matter today are Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Jeff Flake.

All out political war, now.
Remember: @SenateMajLdr did NOT want @realDonaldTrump to nominate #Kavanaugh. The word was Mitch thought the “paper trail” was too long. Translation: K was too brazenly political, having worked for #Starr and #Bush. He would be unnecessarily controversial. The Leader was right.
Important. https://t.co/CHq4ZYFKwd
Also, now we know why there was so much murder-boarding of #Kavanaugh behind the scenes at the #WhiteHouse. New allegations have been floating around for a week. Aides to @realDonaldTrump dismiss all the charges, but still have been asking Kavanaugh to practice answering them.
#Kavanaugh is toast.  #GeorgetownPrep, @Yale and #Deke (@43georgebush’s chapter) don’t prove he has an assaultive attitude toward women (tho check the nickname of his Yale secret society) But as context of accusations, culture is probative. Supreme Court needs supreme character.

I’ll be on @hardball tonight with @HardballChris on @Msnbc talking about the #Kavanaugh drama and the way #Republicans have tied their fates to @realDonaldTrump.
If @TheDemocrats had a #MitchMcConnell fighting #Kavanaugh, they’d get #Christine_Blasey_Ford to go to the MD state’s attorney (a Dem) to demand a probe for sexual assault. Yes, technical barriers (law wording in 1982), but GOP wouldn’t care (&amp; there’s no statute of limitations).
Sen. LindseyGraham didn’t even wait for @SenJohnMcCain to be buried at Annapolis to flee to the  heaving bosom of a man he once claimed, as an allegedly principled political maverick, to loathe, fear and despise: @realDonaldTrump. Watch Graham run errands from now on.
That #BrettKavanaugh’s a hometown DC guy—son of a savvy lobbyist; smart, good-time suburban kid; product of a social big-deal prep school—made him seem an easy sale: a non-scary insider. But now that intimate familiarity could undo him: some locals claim to know him all too well.
Generally when @realDonaldTrump says he feels “badly” for someone it means he’s finished with them.
#BrettKavanaugh is certainly taking the situation seriously. He just hired one of the best criminal lawyers in Washington, #BethWilkinson.

In the #MeToo era, whatever the sexual misconduct story, video or photo is, however borderline it might seem, will hit WAY harder than a lot of people (ie men in power) think at first. #Trump is the only exception. It happened to #AlFranken. It may now happen to #BrettKavanaugh.
I’m still skeptical that a high school incident can stop #BrettKavanaugh. But the disturbing details of ChristineBlaseyFord’s story (plus questions about who paid for his club and paid off his debts) put heat on wavering GOP senators. Is he what he seems? https://t.co/HZFnHp0R9f https://t.co/Re3y9fVZ4X

Today's @steelers game with @Chiefs is make-or-break for the Black and Gold. They are divided, distracted and, frankly, not that great. An 0-2 start is a distinct possibility.

Per #Woodward, @realDonaldTrump is a dangerously fraudulent mix of lies, ignorance, ineptitude and malice: a threat to America, law, democracy and peace. From my reporting I know T thinks lies are the only route to sales and power, and only weak losers believe in facts and truth.
In Washington 17 years ago, the morning air was cool and clear, the cloudless sky a pale violet blue. So different now: damp, close and warm, the rainy sky a gunmetal grey and a monstrous hurricane approaching off in the distance. Sort of the same day, I guess.

Though it’s not remarked on, there is something else going on with @LeVeonBell: rivalry with highly-paid @AB84, @steelers favorite son, #Madden cover star. I  was in Latrobe in ‘17, and saw how AB was—justifiably—revered and pampered, in part because he’s @_BigBen7’s go-to guy.
It certainly doesn’t undercut it, Eggs, tho most of the people who believe that are beyond reasoning with. https://t.co/XnIP1vPJP2
.@LeVeonBell’s agent is a fourth-level guy (judging by business rankings and his roster) who is gambling it all on the idea that he can cry oppression and turn his musician/rapper/running back/receiver client — who was offered $70 mil by the @steelers —into a sympathetic victim.
The @nytimes essay is troubling. Why? 1. The dangerous, ignorant volatility of @realDonaldTrump. 2. The claim by UNELECTED aides to have staged a slo-mo coup. 3. The NYT letting the accuser hide. #Trump’s unfit, but caution: impeachment—not frenzy, mutiny and rumor—is the answer.
If #Woodward is to be believed — and he most certainly should — @realDonaldTrump’s lawyers have argued to #Mueller that it would be all too easy to expose the president for the slow-witted congenital liar that is. It would frighten the world....And Mueller agreed!
Thank you! I tried to brag about that to my wife but she was wildly uninterested. https://t.co/AQPjXOz1rU
The @steelers look to be on the edge of a nervous breakdown if @LeVeonBell doesn’t show — maybe even if he does. Tight end and middle linebacker are weak, Watt is lame etc. Bradshaw was right that D coord should have been fired, and @CoachTomlin seems like a man feeling pressure.

If they play it right, @steelers can turn @LeVeonBell’s one-man sit-down strike into at least some rocket fuel motivation: especially in football, the team is bigger than anyone man. Plus, he’s gambling that @JamesConner_ — who defeated cancer — will fail. Could be a bad bet.

What made @SenJohnMcCain John McCain:1. He could lie but it was his last, least instinctive option. 2. Annapolis and generations leading in the #Navy. 3. Cindy and fam. 4. tension inside the rebellious product of the Establishment — the conflicting ideals of top gun and admiral.
.@SenJohnMcCain in Sedona back in the day: Naval Academy sweatshirt, Beach Boys tape on the boom box, chilled vodka in the freezer, grilling skinless chicken, a roster of plugged-in dinner guests from all walks, family everywhere, young son Jack racing around on a golf cart.
On the #StaightTalkExpress in 2000, we reporters sat transfixed in the back of the bus, listening to @SenJohnMcCain’s stream-of-consciousness, on-the-record candor. Looking back, I can see that, in NH that winter, he was the last free-spirit major candidate: the pilot, flying.
.@SenJohnMcCain was a rebel yet sought reconciliation — in politics, Congress, Vietnam, and society. He reconciled, for example, with former anti-war student leader David Ifshin, who’d traveled to Hanoi while McCain was a prisoner there. They became good friends. That was McCain.
"And I wish all of you great adventures, good company, and lives as lucky as mine.” @SenJohnMcCain
Totally. But it’s not really bias. I’ve just watched him more than the ignorant people who disparage him. One other thing: a heart as big as the Chesapeake. https://t.co/z5dseEikNB
I’m gonna keep saying: @Lj_era8 will be HUGE in the @NFL. His passing has been underrated, as are his smarts and savvy. I hate the condescension about his “athleticism.” I really wanted the @steelers to draft him — if only to keep him out of the division. Now @Ravens have him.
If you read carefully, you see that, even as @SenJohnMcCain died, @realDonaldTrump couldn’t bring himself to say a single nice word about the man. https://t.co/3X14iZJCzY
We’ll miss @SenJohnMcCain. My condolences to Cindy and their kids. My memory of him will be at Sedona, walking along the valley stream he loved. He was so happy and proud to be with his family. A brave pilot, he completed his mission with grace, and is headed homeward now.

Also, @SenJohnMcCain may be one of the last politicians on Earth who believes he can and should win by finding common ground with everyone. His theory is optimistic and inclusive, not bitter and divisive. The only “tribe” he sees is America.
What makes @SenJohnMcCain such an appealing character? The combination of sacrifice, humility, humor, fire and love of people and country. I keep saying it: covering and getting to know him up close is one of the key reasons why I’m glad I chose to become a political reporter.

.@RudyGiuliani told @washingtonpost that @realDonaldTrump has discussed with lawyers pardoning #Manafort. That’s not surprising. What’s surprising is Rudy blabbing about it. Well, I guess that’s not surprising, either. I’m starting to think Rudy is in fact working for #Mueller.

#Mueller may not be a political prosecutor but he certainly is a psychological one — and with @realDonaldTrump that might be one and the same thing.
.@realDonaldTrump is, in effect, the first presidential unindicted co-conspirator since #RichardNixon.

.@RudyGiuliani says obstruction case will come down to a swearing match between @JamesComeyFBI and @realDonaldTrump. That’s the way Rudy wants to frame it; but if #Mueller goes that route, there will be dozens of incidents and incidents for Congress to deal with in impeachment.
My friend and colleague @chucktodd at the Moment of Truth with @RudyGiuliani. Hard to tell of Chuck is trying to show that he’s laughing or crying — which is one reason why he’s the best political reporter, host and anchor on tv. https://t.co/1c6UVSit4x

#RESPECT.
It’s not just the guilty/not guilty bottom line that is key in the #Manafort trial, but the shape of the verdict. There are 18 tax and bank fraud counts. A sweeping conviction on many or all counts would supercharge #Mueller’s political clout in his battle with @realDonaldTrump.

I agree. I know how juries work and the sheer number of counts — and the documents that back them up — makes a hung jury, in fact as opposed to their hope, very unlikely. https://t.co/x9GwpquTZW
#Manafort’s hopes/strategies: 1. hung jury due to a holdout juror, since conviction must be unanimous. 2. If guilty, stall with appeals until @realDonaldTrump fires #Mueller, then join Trump on barricades of resulting crisis. 3. Pardon, based on silence and  loyalty to #Trump.

Bank loan officer I watched today in #Manafort trial was more helpful to the #Mueller team than  #RickGates, though the issues are  more technical. The overall case, based on numbers and paper, is strong. But juries don’t always decide based on the paper, or so defense hopes.
I reported months ago on @HardballChris and #NBCnews that @realDonaldTrump will eventually try to order an investigation of #Mueller and his team. People scoffed. Listen to @RudyGiuliani on @seanhannity from last night. My sources, who know the Trump fever mind hive, were right.

If @TheDemocrats win the #House, chairs of tax-writing committees will have authority to get @realDonaldTrump’s federal returns from the #IRS. Other committees will have subpoena power to demand his business records. In sum, voters will know in 2020 what they didn’t in 2016.

#Manafort trial reminds us that the federal courts are the bastion of constitution-based freedom &amp; justice in our blessed country. If @realDonaldTrump nominates only politically craven hacks, we’re sunk, because I doubt the presidency or Congress (or the states) can save us.
The #Manafort trial is an island of reason in the raging sea of bile and lies that is #Trump World. Judge T.S. Ellis III, 78, appointed by Reagan, patiently focused on the “finding of fact.” He bans phones (tweets) in his pin-drop courtroom. He reveres the jury &amp; the litigants.
While @steelers bust their butts in training camp in rural PA, @LeVeonBell is slapping butts in a Miami strip club; releasing a new rap album dissing his team. In Pittsburgh we have a word for people of his kind. It begins with J. @CoachTomlin needs to step up and slap him down.
All praise to @Pirates for bolstering pitching T the trade deadline.
Seated at the defense table, #PaulManafort was clearly very much in charge of the details of jury selection strategy — a level of hands-on involvement at odds with one of lawyer’ central opening srguments: that he didn’t handle the details of his own consulting businesses.
Just left phone-free courtroom of #Manafort tax/fraud trial. Govt case sounds strong; defense strategy will be to attack credibility of, blame star witness #RickGates, who flipped. Former clothes horse Manafort, in jail these days, was allowed to wear a suit —but he had no socks.

#RichardNixon said, “I am not a crook.” But a specific, statutory crime wasn’t the main issue. It was his and his White House’s systematic contempt for the rule of law that would’ve led to his  removal from office. A Senate impeachment trial is NOT a criminal proceeding per se.
.@realDonaldTrump himself said long ago that collusion isn’t a crime — as he denied there was any. But @RudyGiuliani’s gonzo turn on cable today is interesting because it comes just days after #MichaelCohen’s assertion that #Trump knew in advance about his son’s #Russia meeting.

The right to elect leaders by secret ballot, the results widely trusted, is, with the Constitution, the root of our and everyone’s freedom and rights. It’s so profound we fought a civil and two world wars over it. By bowing to #Putin, .@realDonaldTrump poisons our soil and soul.

When .@realDonaldTrump needs to pretend to cave in to his critics, he haltingly reads a statement at a press avail as if he were a prisoner of war being forced to praise his captors under threat of death or torture. That’s what he did on #Helsinki. No one bought it for a second.
As a country, we’re adrift historically, geopolitically, morally, societally: a ghost ship with no compass in strange seas. The era that began in 1945, and imperfectly sheltered us since, died in #Helsinki. #Trump didn’t cause our unmooring; he is the Capt. Queeg who embodies it.
The “fake news went crazy,” said .@realDonaldTrump, but a few hours later he reluctantly, (necessarily) tiptoed back from the #Helsinki cliff with a lame explanation that he “misspoke.” His aides and advisors had thrown him under the bus in anonymous comments to the press. Weak.
Yes, @realDonaldTrump winked at #Putin as summit started. I saw it; everyone did. They're pals: Vlad, screw with our elections more! Don't tell me any details, but If you can save #GOP control of Congress, great. If you can help me again in 2020, better! https://t.co/qV78ER9rSL

.@realDonaldTrump now openly at war with what he calls the American “deep state:” all U.S. intel agencies, career diplomats, bureaucrats, regulators, Dems, the Bush Family, most of Congress, the EU, NATO, UN and most media except @FoxNews. It’s either destroy them all, or lose.

Watching @seanhannity tonight was darkly amusing. The one-man Stalingrad of #Trump defenders didn’t join his hero, .@realDonaldTrump, in trashing the U.S. intel community and denying the existence of any #Russian meddling. Instead, he parroted the #BillShine talking points.
If @realDonaldTrump is impeached, let alone convicted, it will be because his entire foreign and intel policy IN OFFICE  will have been found to have been be a vast, treasonous effort to cover up illegal 2016 campaign activity: ie., selling out US interests to protect HIMSELF.
I’m interested to see how @FoxNews tries to spin and defend .@realDonaldTrump tonight, especially now that the former Fox News boss, #BillShine, is the new White House communications director and was with #Trump in Helsinki.
Good point by @LesterHoltNBC at top of show: #Putin is further emboldened by .@realDonaldTrump’s support to hack U.S. elections, beginning this fall.
Feels like a storm’s gathering in 	DC, but if .@realDonaldTrump gives #Putin the nuclear codes, #MitchMcConnell will insist it’s sunny here until the @GOP Senate majority is in jeopardy.  And it may be if #Trump doesn’t backtrack on #Helsinki FAST.
BTW, as to #Putin’s dismissive explanation of why he doesn’t have anything on .@realDonaldTrump — that he didn’t personally know #Trump until recently — has nothing to do with whether he has something on Trump.
Every time critics think he’s finally, irretrievably, stepped in it, .@realDonaldTrump has skipped away unscathed. Is throwing himself on the mercy of #Putin in #Helsinki and denouncing U.S. law enforcement and intel different? Only if @GOP leaders come forward. And they won’t.
.@realDonaldTrump thinks the #Mueller probe undercuts the legitimacy of his 2016 win. It's the opposite: let-the-chips-fall-where-they-may support for the investigation would STRENGTHEN his legitimacy -- unless he and his campaign DID in fact collude. Thus the valid suspicion.
I’ll be recalling the #Helsinki summit on @WTOP today in the 1pm hour. An extraordinary non-event event.
Let’s consider what just happened: .@realDonaldTrump flew to #Helsinki so he could stand next to #Putin while denouncing the federal probe into Russia’s interference in the 2016 ejection — and Putin actually tried to sound more cooperative about the probe than Trump!
I went all the way to #Helsinki and all I got was this damned soccer ball.
The #Helsinki presser: #Putin in charge, assuring us that he’s got nothing on .@realDonaldTrump; offering #Trump a face-saving procedural life line on the #GRU hackers; urging us to have faith in our own democracy; smiling as T repudiated his own intel advisors!
“I’ll look into it,” #Putin says about the indicted #GRU disruptors. Tell #Mueller to file an application to extradite; he can come over an investigate IF Russians can come to the US to investigate intel efforts in Russian “territory.” That’s what T &amp; P came up with in private.
Watching #Putin’s thugs in action in real time. Have a look, world.
My friend and former Newsweek colleague Chris Dickey, Paris-based but now in #Helsinki, is doing a terrific job covering #Trump-#Putin meeting on @MSNBC. Chris is justifiably tough, noting Putin’s undermining trust in the “American Republic” — and Trump’s failure to protest it.
.@nytimes reporters list the way early leading/most active @Democrats 2020 contenders. In order of ink/mention: @SenWarren, @BernieSanders, @JoeBiden, @KamalaHarris, @CoryBooker, @DevalPatrick, @MayorOfLA, @SenGillibrand, @GovernorBullock, @TerryMcAuliffe. Again: way early.
.@realDonaldTrump's cave-ins to #Putin were preceded by @BarackObama's cave-ins to #Putin. They've both decided that it wasn't worth it to vigorously confront his territorial aggression and relentless cyber attacks on the West's Enlightenment ideals and democratic institutions.

That’s true. I’ve traveled extensively in Russia going back to the old Soviet days.

We’ve got to assume that #Putin has tons of hidden financial, political and other information on .@realDonaldTrump, ranging from the merely interesting to the explosively damaging. I’ve covered many presidents; never has one been so PERSONALLY vulnerable to another world leader.

True. #Romney was right. And the “ media” did laugh. And in 2016 Romney denounced Trump as a dangerous liar and fraud. I’m sure that on the campaign trail and when he gets to the Senate, Ol’ Mitt will forcefully challenge @realDonaldTrump on #Russia and lots else, right Eggs? :) https://t.co/5Uo2SouxQX
.@realDonaldTrump complains that @BarackObama didn’t move fast enough in 2016 to expose and stop #Russian meddling. That’s like a bank robber complaining after leaving with the cash that the alarm system was broken and the cops showed up late.

you do NOT have to know the real identity of the person or entity you are conspiring with to be found guilty of criminal conspiracy. Attention #RogerStone.
#RogerStone is directly in the target zone of the #Mueller indictment of the #Russians. He clearly linked up with them, whether he knew they were in fact Russians or not.
Read the #Russia indictment from #Mueller and his team. There IS a witch hunt and it has found a giant coven in Moscow. Now the questions are: which Americans knew about and willingly cooperated with those witches and what did @realDonaldTrump know and when did he know it?

#Mueller indicts 12 #Russians for hacking #2016election right before @realDonaldTrump goes to Finland for his friendly, "easy" summit with his buddy #VladimirPutin. Exquisite and hardly accidental timing.

At this point, if you didn’t study law at #Harvard or #Yale, don’t bother dreaming of becoming a #SupremeCourt justice. Those law schools are two of the only things left in public life about which everybody can agree. Like all oligarchs, @realDonaldTrump LOVES max-luxury brands.
#BrettKavanaugh rose in the #Federalist Society, but also in #DC powerful #Catholic  substructure. It’s not understood beyond the Beltway, but it’s roots are colonial (Calverts; Jesuits, Georgetown U.), now suburban. K and #Gorsuch are natives; #Roberts, #Thomas, #Alito joined.
#BrettKavanaugh was an only child, and his lawyer dad was a lobbyist for a #DC-based trade group (fragrances, toiletries, etc) during a period of great growth in the so-called regulatory state. The father’s son’s jurisprudence is defined by a loathing of federal bureaucracy.
#Kavanaugh is determinedly anti-“Big state,’ anti-regulation, favors employers, not expansive on free speech, very pro police etc.
Having been somewhat cautious and traditional with #Gorsuch, @realDonaldTrump swings for the ideological fences with #Kavanaugh, which is going to provoke a gigantic fight #Trump’s base will love heading towards Nov. Kavanaugh is an Ivy insider — but a VERY conservative one.

.@krauthammer was a tough, fearless guy with a first-class mind and stout heart. I didn’t know him well, but respected how neither catastrophic injury nor harsh criticism ever slowed him for a second. His arguments tended to be based on ideas, not #Trump-style ad hominem attacks.
Like a late Roman Emperor, @realDonaldTrump loves to watch his enemies claw each other to the death in the arena. Thus the plan to “streamline” govt by combining/whacking #Democratic strongholds —#HHS, #DeptofEd and Foodstamps —while EXPANDING govt with an Imperial Space Command.

.@realDonaldTrump’s immigrant families rhetoric is a mere preview of the paranoid hysteria he’ll sow to try to stay in power: “infesting” foreigners, “enemy of the people” media, “deep state” plotters. He’ll threaten to blow up what’s left of the Founders’ Republic if he loses.

I’ll be talking #immigration politics with @chucktodd on @MeetThePress Daily today 5-6 EDT. Among other guests: @KasieDC, host of her own eponymous @MSNBC show — and one of the best political reporters in town in any medium.
Of course @Democrats aren’t eager to help @Republicans get #Trump out of a box he put himself in on immigrant-family breakups. And the Dems have a point: no new law is needed to end the draconian policy he and #Sessions instituted six weeks ago. All I would take is a phone call.
As I predicted, @SenateMajLdr #MitchMcConnell came out against the #Trump family-splitting policy; he did so, typically, with a united @GOP #Senate caucus behind him. Let’s see if he can put together a Congress-wide deal on this issue alone. That means a deal with #Democrats.
If you’re a fan of strong borders and limited immigration, @realDonaldTrump is HURTING your cause. In the 21st century, we need  to be BOTH careful and humane. But #Trump’s cruel, cynical stance is producing a clap back of support for the asylum seekers he wants to shut out....
We’ll be discussing the politics of #immigration this morning on @WTOP radio this morning....

I’ve reason to think that #Trump’s “ separation policy” for illegal-immigrant families is so politically toxic that even the @GOP’s cautious @SenateMajLdr #MitchMcConnell tomorrow (Tuesday) will criticize it. Laura Bush (and by extension the Bush clan) and @tedcruz already have.

A #Trump’s gift is his feral sense of weakness in others &amp;/or their yearning for status. He saw that in #Kim; hence #SingaporeSummit. Trump will get quick political benefit. But anything real? Well, he may make #China nervous; otherwise, given his track record, it’s doubtful.
Always amusing/terrifying as a journalist to watch #Trump joke with dictators about how unruly and rude that darned press pool is.... #Kim would have us all shot on the spot.
Good point by @maddow: the #Trump people said there is a “special place in hell” for the decent, humane #JustinTrudeau and a day later our president says it’s “an honor” to meet murderous dictator #KimJongUn.
Key words: verifiable, irreversible reduction and elimination of North Korea’s nuclear military capacity. It’s not about saving money by removing US troops.
I didn’t always agree with #BenRhodes’ moves in the @BarackObama years, but watching him on @MSNBC I understand again why the president relied on him: he’s a very smart guy with a great feel for both the details and narrative sweep of national security and diplomacy.
Hi Dotard! Hi Rocket Man!

Talking #MuellerRussiaProbe with @chucktodd on @MeetThePress daily show today at 5-6 pm. Indictment of a sitting prez was never in the cards; it’s always been about whether #Trump was impeachably colluding and/or obstructing. His best case may be: I obstructed to protect my son.

.@realDonaldTrump stumbled into an Asia hall of mirrors. He's got no clue about #China, #Japan, #Korea, or countries to the south. Never did much business there. He's in over his head in a region that's been home to cutthroat diplo/war maneuvering for millennia. Hold that #Nobel.
Key moment of @celtics v @cavs game — and historic passing of the generational torch in @NBA East: #TerryRozier blows by in open court and flushes a thunderous, sky high dunk on a suddenly timid and exhausted,  trying-to-avoid-a-foul @KingJames.
What an experience! Watched @celtics v @cavs &amp; @Capitals game simultaneously, punching “Last” on the remote every few minutes between ads, time outs, replays etc. @TBLightning aren’t impressive; Caps are. In @NBA, six words: Terry #Rozier, #Jaylen Brown, Brad #Stevens.
On @ThisShowStinks Wednesday, I’m pretty sure we’ll be the only sports podcast to talk about writer #TomWolfe, New Journalism, the @Capitals, @celtics and @cavs all in the same show. I’ll be on with the gracious and yet take-no-prisoners #Visi alumna Jeanne McManus.
Oh, no. #TomWolfe was often imitated, never equaled. A founder of modern non-fiction writing. The  combination of industry, powers of observation, sense of cultural trends and electricity as a writer was peerless. https://t.co/E3kGPSYb4Y

https://t.co/JTTje1cSGa
I have to believe that the #Israelis are too smart, well informed and realistic to think that #Trump adds anything to the legitimacy that #Israel deserves, has earned, and sometimes put at risk in 70 years of modern existence. The new Trump coin looks like the ancient Herod one.
The #press now thinks that it proves the accuracy of stories, especially about #Trump, by stating the precise number of sources talked to. Were it that simple. Quantity doesn’t equal quality. The trend started when a @nytimes reporter wrote that he had 75 (!) sources for a piece.

To confirm previous tweet: Mother’s Day @SNL jokes were cast moms complaining the show was too hard on #Trump. America’s strength is adaptability. Trump is exploiting that. He’s defied the “changed by the office” trope. Instead, he’s demanding the country to adapt to HIM. It is.
Predictably, after shock, anger &amp; outrage, #libs sink to doubt, self-loathing. .@jimmykimmel: #Trump jokes lack punch. .@nytimes op eds: libs aren’t so smart, are too insular; center-right #Dems cool. .@washingtonpost: Dem counties that voted #Trump glum, but haven’t ditched him.

In think I’ve figured it out. The #Trump presidency is a bold real estate play. When he meets with Kim he’ll secure hotel and resort rights in Pyongyang, with an option to buy a minority interest in the whole (denuked) country.
Is #RudyGiuliani simply a dumb real-life clown? Or is he — by accident or design — a rodeo clown, pulling his pants down and jumping into the barrel in a way that distracts the bull and protects  the cowboy?
The @SFGiants, my 2nd favorite baseball team, are in #Pittsburgh. As a kid I’d go to Forbes and watch the Willies and Juan beat up on my Buccos. McCovey must’ve had a lifetime .400 average against us. The sight of his broad back with number 44 on it at the plate was sobering.
At #PNCPark, @Pirates fans show class giving a standing O to #AndrewMcCutchen, now of the @SFGiants. He responded in kind with a long tip of the cap. Great baseball moment. It’s still the best American sport IMHO.
I’m sorry, but as a @steelers fan I have to say that #MasonRudolph sounds like kind of a j....I won’t say it. He should keep his mouth shut. I know @_BigBen7 has his flaws, but he also has two #SuperBowl wins, a ton of amazing stats and is first ballot consensus #HOF.
On @TheBeatWithAri with @AriMelber tonight  I’ll be talking about #Comey, #Trump and the anniversary of @LesterHoltNBC’s interview — the one in which the president said he fired the #FBI director cuz of #Russia probe. Obstruction?
Our family visited the #McCains at their Sedona ranch in spring 2000. (@MeghanMcCain was at her high school prom (!) in Phoenix.) They’re wonderful, gracious, unpretentious people. The senator had vodka in the freezer and Beach Boys on the boom box while he grilled chicken.... https://t.co/3DGLAh9tbo
I’ve known/covered @SenJohnMcCain for decades, traveled with him to Vietnam, visited him &amp; his family in Sedona &amp; Phoenix. So I know first hand that he possesses more dignity, valor &amp; patriotism in a single beat of his brave heart than #DonaldTrump and his entire administration.
The #Mueller theory, we can now see, is that #Trump was so deeply in bed with #Putin-related #Russian oligarchic financial interests that by 2016 he wasn’t merely “colluding” with them, he was a full, inseparable member of the team.
When it comes to #Trump, I’ve said from the jump, “follow the rubles.” But I couldn’t have imagined that the #Russians, AT&amp;T and others in essence paid his lawyer” to silence a porn star paramour and, #Rudy hints, many others.
As I reported on @hardball with @HardballChris tonight, solid inside word is that Justice #AnthonyKennedy — the key swing vote on the #USSupremeCourt — is coming back next year. #Trump &amp; #Federalist Society hardliners would love to replace him, but for now he’s not leaving.
Doing @hardball with @HardballChris at 730 tonight on #Trump, #Iran and #NorthKorea. I’m guessing that the president will  brag hard if he gets a nuclear deal with #Kim similar to the one he just pulled out of with Rouhani!
In a year #Trump; ditched #climate treaty, #NAFTA, #TPP; threatened #NATO &amp; #EU; talked up Afghan pullout; mocked #UN &amp; Arabs, moving embassy to Jerusalem; mused about yanking US troops from #Korea; &amp; upped arms spending. Now he exits #Iran deal. He wants chaos, clearly. But war?
I’m a @penguins fan, but they didn’t quite have it this year and the @Capitals definitely do. #DC hasn’t had a major pro sports championship in decades. Here’s hoping the Caps — and all-time-great #Ovechkin — get one this time.

I agree: when judicious @danbalz, respected for non-partisan reporting and judgments, wields the heavy lumber to call out #Trump as a bald-faced liar — without using ridiculous euphemisms such as “mistruths”, “falsehoods”, etc — it’s significant.

It’s amazing how things work. Somehow, it was #RudyGiuliani who finally emboldened the media — including some at #Fox — to call #Trump a liar in so many words and conclude that it might hurt him politically.

And now #Trump has unleashed the #NationalEnquirer to kneecap #MichaelCohen’s reputation — such as it is — before Cohen can do any damage to him. May be wishful thinking on Trump’s part. This whole saga is about to take on the fratricidal feel of the last reel of a mob flick.
Now I see what #RudyGiuliani’s job is: to concede tactically useful truths that contradict previous brazen #Trump lies. By denying that he’d been the source #StormyDaniels hush money, DT’d thrown #MichaelCohen under the bus. Cohen was no doubt threatening to flip to save himself.

I also have dragon energy, by the way.
At joint session, #Macron rejected #Trumpism from top to bottom. As a speaker — in good English no less — he was a breath of fresh air in Washington, no matter how ground down he is back home in France by political forces to his left and right.
#RonnyJackson will soon be gone and #ScottPruitt’s not be far behind. They both went to #Trump in person to defend themselves and claim that they were indispensable or at least worth saving. #Trump doesn’t like to fire in person and likes to humiliate via pity. They’re finished.
What can you say other than: #LeBron! It’s like watching Ruth, Gehrig, Unitas, Jim Brown, Ali, Jordan — simply one of the greatest athletes in American history. Plus he’s smart, charming, loyal, grounded, decent: great guy all around.
On @ThisShowStinks, I sort of said @Capitals would beat the @penguins, but more out of pity than belief. Three-peats are very hard, and Caps are overdue, but if #Malkin (and #Hagelin) are healthy, look out.

Just watch this. Yes, it’s not the #SEC let alone the @NFL, but I defy anyone to look at this and say he’s not got superstar written all over him. One league wise man told me Lamar is too dumb. They said that about #TerryBradshaw, too. He was #HOF, 4-SuperBowl wins stupid. https://t.co/2BPLZnd10w

Proud of @chucktodd for calling it like it is: @seanhannity — as @AlanDersh said on Hannity’s show — should’ve disclosed his ties to #MichaelCohen; @FoxNews should’ve yanked Hannity or sanctioned him somehow. I’m all for diversity on cable, but this was an affront to journalism.
I humbly offer my condolences to the entire #Bush family on the passing of their beloved matriarch. I know them well enough to have a sense of both their pain and their pride.

@ThisShowStinks has the smartest listeners. Littles are giants. https://t.co/P9GlfxM4Of
Attn @ThisShowStinks @TKLittles: I’ll be answering the classic @barrysvrluga question this morning on the pod about #PresidentTrump’s political &amp; legal situation, “Where are we now?” Answer: #MichaelCohen knows about a lot more than #StormyDaniels. He knows #Russian money flows.
Of all people, @AlanDersh just sucker punched @seanhannity.
BTW, #Comey was too cute by half as #FBI director, trying to show what a non-political guy he was by being political to the nth degree. He’s not a beloved figure and should not be. He damaged #Hillary severely. Still, his portrait of #Trump, while catty in spots, is vividly real.
So great that @JohnArchibald won a #PulitzerPrize. His writing and speaking bring journalistic conscience, reason, humor and grace to public life in the great state of #Alabama and to the entire country. Move over Lou Saban, there’s another national champion in AL.
Is anyone surprised that #Trump &amp; #SeanHannity both use the services (whatever they are) of #MichaelCohen? Is anyone surprised that Hannity is on #FoxNews “reporting” on Cohen without disclosing that? Is anyone surprised about ANYTHING this crowd does? Answers: no, no and no.
The #Comey portrait of his encounters with #Trump are chilling &amp; cinematic but won’t change the balance. To win 2018 midterms &amp; White House in 2020 #Dems must drop the idea that swing voters will suddenly, finally, be repulsed by the prez. Dems need new, upbeat, coherent message.
EPA Spending On Scott Pruitt's Soundproof Phone Booth Broke Federal Law, Government Watchdog Finds https://t.co/DZf32HOr9M
Totally. #BarbaraBush over the years shot me some withering glances. Her husband &amp; son sometimes made it clear they didn’t like what I wrote. But no Bush ever attacked personally, in publicly or private; they never complained publicly. They could be silent, but not vindictive. https://t.co/JPmud8OLAU
I’ve known #BarbaraBush for 30 years. She is as proud, tough, protective of her family and patient as you would expect a wife and mother of presidents to be. She helped both in sensible, family-centric ways; in that sense is as much a patriotic, civic-minded leader as they are.

Based on 1st leaks, #Comey interview &amp; book will further divide the country, making a consensus on #Mueller’s final findings more difficult to achieve. Is Comey’s lofty (&amp; soon-to-be-profitable) self-regard more important to him than the national interest in dealing with #Trump?
EPA staffer is fired for undermining Pruitt's need for security detail	THIS GUY....  https://t.co/ZRZIzZcUuc
By invoking what amounts to national security — saying the #Mueller probe is an “attack on the country” — #Trump is laying the groundwork for firing #Rosenstein &amp; getting someone to fire Mueller. Rosenstein approved #MichaelCohen raid.
Where did #MichaelCohen get the rubles to pay #Stormy? Is that a theory of #Mueller’s?

Little doubt now that #Trump will try to shut down #Mueller. It’s more urgent because: 1) #Russia probe is into his business &amp; personal finances; 2) he’s got a tighter circle of sycophants around him; 3)it’s looking more like #Dems will win Congress (and subpoena power) in Nov.
@UKCoachCalipari has an all-frosh lineup for @KentuckyMBB. 3 are @NBA 1st round; others will be drafted, too. One-and-done gets it done often enough. At least #UK is honest about what major college ball is about: wins, cash, clout. #CoachK and others wish they could do the same.
How ‘bout @colgateuniv @ColgateWIH? Academically intensive LAC w/ only 2,900 students, yet in women’s #FrozenFour beat @UWBadgers of @bigten, w/ an enrollment of 43,000! We’re one of two top-12 @USNews LACs that plays NCAA Div. 1. in a range of sports. (#Davidson is the other.)
Further evidence that #Trump sees his real enemy in the #Stormy Suit as @CBSNews/ @60Minutes: the lawyer he’s hired to represent him is #ChuckHarder, who successfully led #HulkHogan suit against now-defunct #Gawker. This is a parallel universe to #Mueller probe and much nastier.
Real target of #Trump $20 million claim in #StormyDaniels arbitration is @CBSNews. The aim is to scare the network into not running her interview on @60Minutes.

Strictly a hypothesis: #Trump &amp; Texas ally put #FoxNews up to blaming the slain #SethRich for the #Wikileaks dump of #HillaryClinton emails. A new  lawsuit may uncover what happened behind the scenes. #Mueller may want to investigate why they were trying to cover #Russia tracks.
This is probably as close inside this insane moment in this insane #WhiteHouse as we’re going to get. #Trump, with python #Mueller coiling tighter, is on a rampage, searching for comforting, scandal-free loyalists who will defend him to the end.  https://t.co/LunEHzVgSD

I’ll be on @Hardball tonight at 730 w/ fellow Pennsylvanian @HardballChris, reporting on #PA18 race in my hometown, #Pittsburgh. Dem #ConorLamb won a huge upset &amp; rattled the #GOP in a district that went for #Trump by 20 points &amp; where Trump visited twice to back loser Saccone.
When the Ivies get as promotional as everyone else in college basketball... though of course I’m rooting for @pennathletics. https://t.co/9CGRjtrSgB
#ConorLamb’s site ignores #Trump and does not suggest that Lamb would try to roll back tax cuts; if there was tv ad attacking “giveaway” I missed it. He’s a model for #Dems in red districts: Marine, prosecutor, white, devout, can-do, Ivy but anti-elite.  https://t.co/y95Fwx7q0a

“Eat the salad, #Rex,” is one of the funniest moments of the #Trump Era. Another: when he ordered meatloaf for #ChrisChristie. Or when he made #MittRomney sit through a four-course meal with him at a three-star restaurant. Humiliation via dinner. They all deserve each other.
#ConorLamb race may show #Democrats how to become the majority party again. An exclusionist #Trump #GOP provides a huge opening IF Dems re-learn the lessons of the FDR-to-LBJ era: humane progressivism applied with politically pragmatic tolerance for regional &amp; cultural diversity.

Lessons of #PA18: big-city 2018 suburban turnout will be huge, swinging away from #Trump &amp; #GOP. Rural GOP turnout will be tepid. #Dems on course to win back #House &amp; maybe #Senate, but with cautious moderates like #ConorLamb who will set up #2020 fight for soul of the party.

#Mueller team will of course want to compare the emails #Nunberg turns over with what they already have and will later get via subpoenas of higher ups. Looking for who chooses to leave out what... names, topics, dates...
#Mueller’s using not only legal methods but psychological ones. He’s not showing his hand to the central characters, leaving them to imagine the worst. He gives #Nunberg a huge list of targets, mostly to apply public pressure on them. He wants a key figure to crack like a walnut.
I’m told #RogerStone advised #SamNunberg to NOT go on TV today, insists he’s not involved in Sam’s antics. They ARE talking, as Nunberg said. Stone continues to scoff at the #Russia collusion accusation, but #Mueller gets that no one knows more about TrumpWorld’s inside story.
I’ve heard some strange things covering politics; #SamNunberg calling #RogerStone his “father figure” is tops. Stone is many things; fatherly is not one of them. But there’s a reason Nunberg melted himself down: If #Mueller tries to crack Stone, it’ll get very ugly for everyone.

#Turks and #Qataris (and #Iran in background) going for payback against pro-#Saudi, pro-#UAE #Kushner. But he made himself vulnerable — and made a hash out of foreign policy — by sticking his hand out for loans that would functionally be seen as either gifts or bribes.
Looks like #Kushner is turning into exhibit A for the case against having private-citizen family members in the #WhiteHouse. He was making policy in the #PersianGulf &amp; begging for personal loans from sheiks at the same time! It’s not just corrupt but it undermines US credibility.
3) It’s revealing that #WhiteHouse aides (#GaryCohn?) prefer to tell reporters #Trump is crazy than that he’s a protectionist. It’s one of the few policy principles he seems to believe in. The real point is that anyone who loses a policy fight feels free to call the boss nuts!
2) #Trump has been itching to drop the hammer on #steel &amp; #aluminum imports for months; dissed #WilburRoss as old and slow cuz the commerce sec wasn’t moving fast enough to build the tariff case. Also, this is timed to try to help #GOP in special House race near #Pittsburgh.

Just because the #trump people mentioned in THESE #RussianIndictments didn’t know about the conspiracy and were “unwitting” dupes doesn’t mean that other #Trumpians didn’t know. This is a typical #Mueller incremental move. It puts both legal and political pressure on #Trump.
Think of the #conspiracy count in the #RussianIndictments as very sticky fly paper. The question is: which Americans buzzing around in #Trump world will get stuck on it as the #Mueller probe continues. All it takes is one “overt act” and even silence (with knowledge) can be it.
The most fundamental impeachable offense by #PresidentTrump is the most glaringly obvious one: his reluctance, his failure — his blackmail-enforced inability? — to investigate, decry &amp; prevent #Russian efforts to gaslight our democracy.

Sobering thought for #Dems? If #Trump cooled his #tweets and put together a minimally competent #WhiteHouse staff, he’d probably be above 50 percent. But of course he wouldn’t be Trump.

A “ wedge issue” isn’t one that divides the country; it’s one that divides the other party (even better if it unites your base). For #Trump, that issue is immigration; the base is blue-collar whites. Jamming #Dems on DACA/budget, he aims to split Hill leaders &amp; Hispanic street.

As I've reported, #Trump has been told he cannot -- should not -- fire #Mueller: too risky. Instead the prez is doing all he can to hem him in, discredit him &amp; those around him, &amp; will avoid -- with Supreme Court court help if possible -- giving the prosecutor a real interview.
If it's #treasonous to not applaud #DonaldTrump, it's treason to: laugh at, criticize, investigate or refuse to vote for him. Should we ignore his #Cincinnati speech? No. Take it seriously? Yes. It was a road-test of new ways to troll the media, inflame his base, destroy foes.

#TreyGowdy is tasked by #Trump #GOP in the House with reading the underlying intel on #Russia probe’s secret #FISA warrants. Goal: proof the probe is a rigged partisan witch hunt. Gowdy, of Benghazi fame, reads, then announces he’s leaving Congress.  No proof, I’m guessing.

Having face-planted on #NunesMemo in weak effort to dirty up #Mueller, #Trump may be tempted to start firing people above him...even #Mueller, despite warnings from the prez’s own rabid advisors that that is just what Mueller is hoping will happen....
Further: #Trump’s mental laziness and refusal to read in any detail  (or inability to think) came back to bite him here. No way even a non-lawyer could actually read the #NunesMemo and think it was a game changer.
Let’s get #ChristopherSteele over here! Sounds like great TV.
Doesn’t matter — if he had credible investigative info. Everybody’s got a motive. What matters are provable acts and statements: probable cause to believe that they could be proved beyond a reasonable doubt (criminal standard) in a court of law. https://t.co/Mbiyoq1ahq
It’s also true that there was nothing the least bit catastrophic to the #FBI or #DOJ in the #NunesMemo. #Assange is right about that. So this whole drama has been a farce all the way around.
I’ve known the great #MikeIsikoff for decades. Talking to him, as #Steele evidently did, is what everybody does sooner or later. It may be foolish but it’s not a crime. If that’s all they got, #NunesMemo is unintentionally comic even as it’s release is destructive.
#NunesMemo concedes that #Steele had provided reliable intel in the past. Pretty much undercuts the whole argument about the #FISA warrants being corrupt. #Nothingburger.

But don’t take comfort, #Dems: #Trump in #SOTU doubled down on the strategy that won him the industrial Midwest and the presidency. He’s eating out of the old Dem lunchpail on trade, jobs, “cheap foreign labor,” love of cops &amp; firefighters, etc., even vocational training.
#Trump #SOTU is far more of a “triumph of the right” speech than  anything else. It’s: we won, get over it, it’s year two,we’re in charge. Feel free to agree with us. Now stand and salute the flag. His message is one of total self-satisfaction; fighting words sleepily delivered.

Before it ends, a word about #HolocaustRemembranceDay. The worst era of   humankind was ended by America at its best. We sacrificed to win the moral high ground. Our mission remains:  defeat racism, bigotry, discrimination, anti-Semitism, hatred of all kinds. We ARE exceptional.
This #WaPo theory, if true (which it no longer is, if it ever was), if accepted by #Mueller (which it won’t be) plays right into #Trump’s hands: hey, I’m just a NY real estate guy! I got nothin’ against the #Constitution! What is that anyway, a steak house on Second Ave? https://t.co/5756KJ5hzo

Knowing #Trump and his circle, I’ve doubted his ultimate vulnerability. But combo of #Stormy (Melania bailing?) and #McGahn-refuses-to-fire-Mueller story makes me wonder how long the president can take this. The walls, personal and political, are closing in.

#Mueller's team might also want news out: to prevent the very action #Trump wanted to take in June. Mueller's firing would cinch the case M wants to make! But M can't risk offering his own demise as proof because he can't be sure the GOP Congress would have the guts to convict.
If #McGahn flips, and tonight's @nytimes story would seem to raise that possibility, then there's hardly anyone left on the parapets of #Trump Tower to pour boiling oil down on investigators. But Trump dead-enders also may be trying to sap #Mueller shocks in advance....

Attn @ThisShowStinks @TKLittles: I’m returning from a galaxy far, far away to cover politics in DC for https://t.co/VnQjKuxp5N. #PresidentTrump has disrupted the time/space continuum, so I had to leave job as @HuffPost intergalactic editor.
After 7 great years, during which @HuffPost grew from a SoHo startup to a global force, I’m taking the writing part of my work to @NBCNews.com, which has its own big plans. I’ll contribute on politics in DC &amp; elsewhere while still doing TV on @MSNBC.  https://t.co/jnE5rDHdIR

If @Steelers face @Patriots again I’m betting @jharrison9292 plays, and has more impact on the game than, say, the nearly invisible Bud Dupree. In the meantime #Belichick once again toys with @CoachTomlin and his brain trust.
I’m sorry. @CoachTomlin beyond stupid to cut @jharrison9292. Of course he’d go right to @Patriots!!

Revealing tweet by @realDonaldTrump. He immediately congratulated #DougJones to try to shut down #RoyMoore (Steve Bannon) vote-count protest.
Did disaffected suburban white #Republicans write in #LouSaban? If so they elected #DougJones.
#Shelby beat #RoyMoore.
The #Write-ins ARE the difference in #AlabamaSenateElection.
#Belicheck of @Patriots doing what he always does: scrounging for free agents with dubious pasts as the playoffs loom.
The #Write-ins may beat #RoyMoore at the wire in #AlabamaSenate. Those are strong  @GOP voters who just couldn’t abide him.
Growing up, I thought #Hanukkah was lame, ginned up to jam the cultural radar of #Christmas in assimilationist America. But now I like it as part of the kaleidoscope of the country, one of many holiday expressions of family and peace.
@steelers still need to beat @Patriots in #Pittsburgh Sunday to get a lock on home field. So Pats losing tonight doesn’t mean much unless it gives new clues on how to beat them. Mostly hoping #Brady has a bad day....

The #ALSen race is about two voting groups: blacks &amp; upscale evangelical suburban white women. For #DougJones to win, the former need to turnout at #Obama era levels; the latter need to be definitively (perhaps secretly) repulsed by #RoyMoore.

Someone said the #Trump-#Russia saga is #Watergate without brains.
#Trump needs to send out, “Please disregard previous tweet!”
#UCF pretty good; especially convincing in wins over FIU, Maine, Austin Peay, UConn etc.
Scribbled secret #tax cut deals among #Republicans all the rage in #USSenate tonight.
Don’t forget: #Flynn headed the #DIA; knew all about #Russia’s cyber/digital/social actions &amp; capabilities in the U.S. — &amp; presumably how use them fo the #Trump campaign, where he was a top advisor.
Among great bits on @PresidentShow Xmas special on @ComedyCentral, best was fantasy video of what #Trump would be had he not started rich: a cranky, immigrant-fearing loudmouth grifter wearing a wife-beater T-shirt in a pizza parlor in Queens.

Last night was pivotal for many reasons. One: the #Dems have NO incentive to do a tax-bill deal.
Ships passing in the night: #Trump's mostly white, male, evangelical America v. everybody else. #VA vote shows vividly: NOVA v. Southside.
Yes, #DanicaRoem is the story of the night: not just that she'll be America's 1st trans state legislator, but that she won the job in #VA!
If #Gillespie had "embraced" him more fully, he would have lost worse. https://t.co/jzUxs1d4VO
#Dem #PhilMurphy of #NJ, a novice, wasn't a great campaigner. But I know him: he's a smart, decent, live-wire money guy - &amp; now a player.
#GOP was doing Election Day robo calls with #Trump -- which #McAuliffe correctly saw as a sign that #Dems had 'em on the run.
#Gillespie wasn't "seg" enough for #Southside #Virginia. His ads were raw, but he was just a smooth party hack who'd gone to college in DC!
Another thing: in our 21st century, slow-motion cultural civil war, a new Army of the Potomac (diverse, inclusive) now controls #VA from DC.
He was right on target. https://t.co/n0e7ebrwHE
#Trump may claim that if he'd campaigned in #VA, #Gillespie would've won. No. Trump in the flesh would've jacked #Dem turnout even higher.
#Gillespie, in real life not  #Trump-#Bannon type, ran on their harsh, xenophobic message. But #VA voters were interested in health care.
Well #TerryMcAuliffe was right when I talked to him earlier -- at least that is what projections show. He gets a boost out of this, btw.
But of course #Clinton people and supporters were confident on Election Day, too....and there is heavy rain in dem-leaning northern #VA.

#Paddock had 19 guns in the room, some illegally upgraded from semi to fully automatic; 18 more at home. Hideous, unconscionable numbers.
I wish the horror of the #LasVegas massacre was beyond imagining. It's not. But "we will get through this together," as the sheriff said.

yep. NYT did it's best to catch up, and had some great scoops, though they never really matched Ben Bradlee's WaPo. https://t.co/HSLvREthrG
#Trump's caught in a nasty crossfire between two great, ferociously competitive newspapers, @nytimes &amp; @washingtonpost. Old school lives!
Great show with a distinguished host. https://t.co/1RAMWBDvH2
New @washingtonpost scoop more than explosive. #Trump, already cozy with #Russia, blabs to them about key intel source on the #IslamicState!
Trump Thinks He Can Defeat the Russia Probe. He attacks the weak; now GOP, courts, FBI must be strong. My new piece. https://t.co/kizF9UvDwi

Is #Trump's brazen, open ignorance of &amp; contempt for law, Constitution &amp; free press a "winning" strategy in 21stC America? We'll find out.
I'm wearing black to work at @HuffPost in #DC on Monday. @WashWizards will win game seven.
While I'm at it on sports, @Pirates suck.
Being an asshat does not mean that you can't be smart and (unintentionally) funny. That is the amusingly incisive zen of #StephenASmith. https://t.co/ETICfsn7J2
Obviously I disagree. https://t.co/ETICfsn7J2
#StephenASmith is my hero. Love to have him in the White House covering @realDonaldTrump. There'd be nothing left.
#BradStevens is a terrific coach and a nice guy. I wanted him to coach @GoCards.
Great game,  @WashWizards v @celtics. D.C. has a chance -- a chance -- in Boston.
Two pointers, I meant. In the end, the three. Money https://t.co/KjVZfzVdcA

"A little whiff of fascism," @HardballChris just said on @Msnbc of #Trump firing #Comey.
I agree. https://t.co/tCHo7dMoVv
Did #Trump literally trust only his private bodyguard #KeithSchiller to deliver the #Comey firing letter? It's out of Game of Thrones.
#Trump has now fired an acting attorney general &amp; an FBI director. Chilling detail: Trump's private bodyguard delivered the firing letter.
Yes it's monumentally ironic. https://t.co/3wlFesino7
I agree with #Schmidt that they'd been preparing for and looking for ways to get rid of #Comey for weeks -- maybe even since Nov. 8th.
RT @nytmike: WH and DOJ had been working on firing Comey since at least last week. Sessions had been working to come up with reasons.
I'm not saying that. I'm saying that #Comey gave him an excuse and political space. https://t.co/aRBPvOc8hm
#Trump was looking for a reason to oust #Comey, &amp; Comey gave it to him the other day by vastly overstating the volume of #Abedin emails.
#Comey had faults -- too political by half -- &amp; pissed everyone off on all sides. But #Trump firing is gasoline on fire of #Russia probe.

#Trotz is a very good defensive coach and it is showing tonight in @Caps @penguins
Just my opinion, but I think Sullivan should have kept #Crosby out of @Caps - @penguins Game 5 in DC.
@Caps https://t.co/o2qzSiUEAG
Fact is, @Caps have outshot &amp; outhit @penguins in all the games. If Washington wins tonight in #Pittsburgh, they deserve to win the series.
#Crosby getting banged around badly. Not a good situation.
#Obama speaking now at Kennedy awards, thanks the 54 House dems who lost in 2010 at least in part cuz they voted for his health care bill.
Despite #Macron win, nativist/fascist/populist threat alive in #France &amp; elsewhere. Free world needs real reform of democratic capitalism.
But I also think they should have sold him advertising time. If he wants to pay to support REAL news, which is what those outfits are, fine.

Lusting for a "win", loathing #Obama, #HouseGOP poised to pass a morally weak, politically suicidal bill to aid the image of #Trump/#Ryan.
#GOP can ram an unread, #healthcare bill through House but cant keep it secret after that. #Upton, threatened from the right, the key.
@Penguins -- without four starters including #SidneyCrosby -- beat @Capitals. I'm not at all surprised, and neither is any DC fan.
That was pretty covered, Eggs. But he didn't have the cojones to indict; intent was too hard to prove. So he made over-the-line comments. https://t.co/bHa6dpOGOD
#Comey'd be a bit credible today had he not shamelessly covered his ass politically by trashing #Hillary when 1st closing the email probe.
#JimmyKimmel may have single-handedly killed the #ACA repeal. His son was born with the ultimate  pre-existing condition.
You knew @Capitals, perennial playoff losers to @Pens, would try to take out #SidneyCrosby with a head shot. That was no "hockey play."

Although nothing beats the golf balls in hash browns story. That can't be the worst thing ever in hash browns.
