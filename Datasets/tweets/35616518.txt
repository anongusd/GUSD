@drsfarnsworth Do you think any of them end up resigning? Or is the fact all three have scandals actually aligning forces in a way that they all end up keeping their jobs?
@hencexox Maybe he won't. But he'd have to be a pariah for three years. How could he do things like deliver state of the state, fundraise, go to elementary schools, cut ribbon at new Amazon HQ...
@drsfarnsworth Right. But if he can't get the legislative black caucus back on board with him, how does he stay governor for three years? Hard to imagine.
@vpaige It assumes a lot, of course. And would that person who Northam would essentially appoint governor get to serve the whole term, or would there be a special election Nov 2019?
And in this scenario, could it be that a popular former D governor like Mark Warner is appointed to the Lt Gov position by Northam, knowing he'd become gov upon Northam resignation as a place-holder to help the state heal?
Is one possible scenario that Fairfax ends up resigning first, Northam appoints new Lt Gov (after Senate R pro tem serves as acting capacity), then Northam resigns leaving his appointed Lt Gov to become D governor? https://t.co/Nh9hrGxnsn

Farmers have the 9th highest rate of suicide among men; so few women farmers die by suicide that CDC does does not report a rate.
So why does Congress want to spend $2M to study suicide among farmers? The Senate agriculture committee said farmers "have the highest overall suicide rate among all occupations," which is not true. Committee appears to be quoting data since retracted by CDC https://t.co/tUU4jRX5FX
What's more, the rate of suicide among farmers has actually dropped in recent years, in contrast to the increase in suicides occurring across all occupations
Updated CDC research shows construction and extraction workers have the highest suicide rates by far among men. For women, arts/design/entertainment/sports/media jobs have the highest suicide rates
The spending bill the House is set to approve tomorrow includes $2M to research suicide and stress among farmers, interesting because CDC recently retracted a report that said farmers had the highest rate of suicide. https://t.co/1s528hbNPu

The Senate just passed this, voting to end secret taxpayer settlements for harassment claims against lawmakers; deal does not address discrimination claims. House to vote on deal later today.
Both House and Senate today expected to pass anti sexual harassment deal for Capitol Hill staffers by unanimous consent.
House Ds say they'll work to add more teeth to this next Congress.
With the Congress harassment legislation looking like the Senate version, and Pelosi saying last week they'd be open to passing it, looks likely to clear both chambers.
Also out: Independent investigations of claims brought by staffers, something that was in the House bill but not the Senate.
In: Lawmakers having to reimburse taxpayers for harassment settlements	Out: Lawmakers having to reimburse for discrimination settlements

I end this Friday rabbit hole tour with a plug for @KGoldMD, who is actually going through CDC data to come up with a reliable estimate for suicidality among doctors. She hopes to publish her results soon.
And can you ever really get a true count, when the shame of suicide leads families to conceal cause of death? The obit for the doctor we featured in our piece said he died suddenly. This is not unusual.
As just a newsman who had to do kindergarten twice, I still wonder: how can you truly tackle a problem if you don't know how often it occurs? Which doctors are most at risk? Where is this most likely to happen?
If anyone finds a count out there backed by scientific research, I sure would love to see it.
Big picture: While research says doctors kill themselves at a higher rate, there does not appear to be any reliable estimate of just how many die by suicide.
In the end, we don't know where the 300-400 figure came from originally, and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention has now taken the stat down from its website. https://t.co/XUUKnDTwix
Someone told me the 300-400 figure probably came from this study that found 379 white male physicians dying by suicide. But when I talked to the researchers of that report, they told me it was 379 over the course of 11 years. Big difference. https://t.co/v4nOMIIDRl
I asked the lead researcher, how can you know doctors have a high suicide rate if you don't know numbers of suicides? She said it's because she looked at different sample sizes in different countries in different years.
It's a fascinating read, even if you're like me and didn't exactly excel in science class. https://t.co/yYixd7k5Nu
The analysis we decided to use for doctor suicide rates was deemed the most sound by a number of researchers we consulted. It's from 2004, and found male docs were 1.4x as likely to die by suicide than the general population. Women were 2.21x as likely.
There's still reason to think doctors do have a high rate of suicide, though we also found nothing to substantiate the other claim found lots of places that they have the highest rate of suicide of any profession.
The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention had the 300-400 figure on its website, linking to a 2003 JAMA report. It said a lot about the issue, but never actually gave a count of suicides.
Google "doctor suicide" and you'll find the stat about 300-400 docs killing themselves in the first grafs of dozens of articles about physician suicide
It's perhaps a cautionary tale in how quickly squishy numbers can spread, like that claim that we use 500 million straws a day. https://t.co/Tfvtc8D0E3

This all exposes an interesting question: How often does the US Treasury actually seek to claw back wasteful govt spending?
But... homeowners have been turned away from the Fund. It can't help everyone. And it's still receiving federal tax dollars to help underwater homeowners. "That's not crabcake dinners," IG Romero said
To be clear, the questionable spending is a tiny fraction of the Hardest Hit Fund's $9.6 billion budget
Kentucky coughed up $1309 for office coffee and water
Some states have voluntarily paid back some of the expenses. Illinois for example told us it repaid $102K spent on employee retention and meals
Treasury says it's reviewing the pages of questionable expenses but hasn't told us if/when it will bill states
"Every dollar that was wasted or squandered is just one less dollar to help homeowners," TARP IG Christy Goldsmith Romero told us
Documents from TARP special inspector general show states spent money on employee perks: bonuses, parking, parties, dinners and in NC: a pinata

#NetNeutrality rules are "a power grab" by FCC chmn "who finally succumbed to the bully tactics" of @BarackObama, -@SenJohnThune
"Aftermath" of @BarackObama endorsing #NetNeutrality helped @FCC decide to ban Internet fast lanes.
.@FCC rule would not affect what broadband providers charge for Internet.
.@FCC keeps using tried/true TV news devotion to 3s in this wonky #NetNeutrality call: "No blocking, no throttling, no paid prioritization"
Bottom line: #NetNeutrality would become law. "Fast lanes" banned. Consumers would have new avenues for complaining about throttling w/ FCC
#NetNeutrality rule would let FCC could launch investigations into practices consumers find troubling, like throttling
New Internet rules would also prevent future harm from evolving technology, @FCC says
No Internet fast lanes, @FCC proposes. This would codify status quo.
.@FCC would be able to investigate complaints of throttling Internet speeds.
"No blocking, no throttling and no paid prioritization" of Internet, per proposed @FCC #NetNeutrality rule
.@FCC now briefing us on new rule to formally treat the Internet as a utility. No "fast lanes." #NetNeutrality
