@SebGorka If Kristol is “left wing” then you must be a Nazi.
@realDonaldTrump Off the deep end. Hard to believe she’s still with WSJ. Should be working for DJT’s PAC or the RNC.

DJT giving a world tour of failures of his diplomacy throughout the world.
@CBSNews @cbsaustin And neither did Kim.
Leaders/Kim didn’t know about it? Felt bad about it? Takes him at his word. Like Putin.
It’s South Korea’s fault too. They need to pay it.
Don’t be surprised if Moon moves forward with Kim and they leave DJT behind.

@kurdts @BoiledSports @slizzii Basic math: IU 5 PU 0.
@BoiledSports @kurdts @slizzii Matt Painter is a decent coach as was Gene Keady. Neither won the national title. That’s the standard for great coaches. Painter has been there for 14 years. 2 big ten titles. Tom Izzo is the great coach now.
@thehill Or may just talk about and then fall in line.
@kurdts @BoiledSports @slizzii Fact: you haven’t seen one from the Boilers either since you’ve been born.

@VP @MaeveReston Had to find someone to clap for him.
@KevinMKruse @borealizz What a joke. Anyone who knows history knows that southern Democrats like Bull Connor switched to the Republican Party after LBJ signed the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act. It’s no coincidence that southerners now dominate the Republican Party.
@B52Malmet If true, the U.S. is going to become an advocate of nuclear proliferation rather than the main opponent of it.
@bradheath What a surprise. Clarence wants to make it easier for Trump, et. al, to intimidate the press when the press write stories they don’t like.
DNI Dan Coats the next to go? He dared spoke the truth about North Korea in public.
@ForecasterEnten His best chance is based on having a dedicated group of supporters who will turn out for him while the large field of opponents split the remaining vote.
@thehill The Mussolini look.
@FiveThirtyEight Sure. Why stop being cowards now?
@Hope012015 Wishes he had one that size.
I used to think it was Adderall too but a side effect is loss of appetite. No evidence of that with DJT. https://t.co/1Rz18e5SEn
Sitting in a car wash line having an “existential” moment before picking up my grandson for his TaeKwanDo class.
@cmclymer @PressSec A moment of silence is for the deceased. Come to think of it...
@cbsaustin So he can say “I’m clean” when he’s busted.
@matthewjdowd Mail delivery?
@nocontext_fox I’m sure she’s still talking about you, Tucker. Keep one eye open in bed tonight
@maggiemahar Agreed
@atrupar @Jim_Jordan Put a sport coat on. Nobody thinks you’re working hard just because you don’t wear one.
@B52Malmet Poor Huma.
@Pat90353505 @BetoORourke Who? Joe Biden, Bernie, Bill de Blasio, Terry McAuliffe, Michael. Bennet, Sheridan Brown, Jay Inslee, or Eric Smallwell.
@ImJonAbramson @BetoORourke Agreed
@chrisstratton19 @bubbagump324 @amyklobuchar Watch for Beto and Kamala, and Elizabeth Warren.
@kimguilfoyle Love that sneering smile of hers.
@Hope012015 Hey Mikey, please stop making the mullah a look reasonable.
@atrupar @MelissaJPeltier Runs in the family.
Agreed https://t.co/76XiCr5s0B
@acnewsitics @LorraineJDion Love this picture. A chip over the old Mussolini block.
Endorsements aren’t as important as they used to be but I think any Democratic candidate would love to get President Obama’s or the former First Lady. Anecdotally, judging by the intensity to my earlier tweet about endorsements Beto has the most intense fans.
@Libby_italiana Nothing wrong if you did. Why are all these “capitalists” giving you a bad time?
@kjksccr @JBENEDI32714453 @NorthForkOeno @benjaminwittes @DavidKris @n8jones81 John Roberts is a liberal like Bernie is a wingnut. Parallel universe, Lou. Come back to reality.
@joshtpm @TPM Another emergency-he lost his toupee or whatever that landing strip was on his head a couple of weeks ago.
@Kokomothegreat @MailOnline Make sure to accompany the troops whose lives you are disrupting so that you can play at politics governor.
@Pat90353505 @BetoORourke I agree that in most cases they don’t anymore, but I imagine that any Democratic candidate would love to have President Obama’s endorsement.
@judyschear @BetoORourke Well aware of it.
@revrrlewis @JordanUhl Rush is nothing but the model of a failed college student who went on to become rich by telling people how the world works even though he has no idea how it does.
@DerekCressman We’re going to miss you Chancellor as much as you missed President Obama the last 2 years.
@IngrahamAngle @kimguilfoyle How do you get away with it?
@B52Malmet I think federal judges will.
@BillKristol What got his nose so out of joint this morning?
DJT should get an “outperform” next time he meets Vlad. Pence will always get an “incomplete” https://t.co/1vjeZ3cXDA
@axios i.e. the tax “cut” was illusory for most people.
@Theharwells @BetoORourke Why not?
@TerriakiSan @BetoORourke Nope. Just testing the waters. Seems to be getting serious though.
@Saturday365_ @BetoORourke Agreed. He do a great job against Cruz and has created the kind of excitement needed to overwhelm the Republicans in 2020 whatever he chooses to do.
@djbcxbb @BetoORourke Or vice versa.
@business And Matthew Whitaker is where? And Ivanka and Jared are where?
@BBCNews Has Harry’s changed?
@jiveDurkey He’s not 6’3” tall. He has a 63” waist.
@PhilippeReines You’re confused. It’s a 63 inch waist.
@BiglyPrez @JaneNel34178882 How does it feel under that bus, Jared. Sounds like the boss is not happy with the Munich Security Conference.
@HartKariann That is great Kariann. You’re a hero .
@drmom247 @BetoORourke True. Interested in seeing how he handles it.

@FaceTheNation @rmndza @IvankaTrump Keep it up. We’ll be alone soon.
@DianaBo89025068 @Litapi1 Totally
@thehill It wasn’t just the offenses of which  he was convicted. He was repeatedly lying to the OSC violating his cooperation agreement. He would probably have gotten a similar deal to Michael Cohen’s if he hadn’t lied.
@BetoORourke Did anybody tell him that she endorsed Kamala today?
@nickiknowsnada @Lennondac Where is the hug for Ivanka?
@brianstelter ...”grueling for our family and our undocumented nanny.”
@sam_vinograd @saltyconchy A president who is just acting.
@SebGorka @RichardGrenell @realDonaldTrump Yep. They hate his guts so he’ll fit right in at the UN.
@Kris_Sacrebleu You could see the warm reception she was receiving from those around her.
@JohnWDean @cmfranchie Wait until DJT has a “chat” with him. Then we’ll see.
@joshrogin Couldn’t answer the beauty pageant answer correctly.
@MSignorile @GottaLaff I’m afraid the refusal to allow police his cellphone to verify his claim that he was talking to his manager when attacked was a dead giveaway.
@djrothkopf She didn’t even belong there.
@maggieNYT Stock market better get ready for a big slide.
@NateSilver538 Until they have to actually vote to override.
@NightlyPolitics No. DJT is still president.
@atrupar @peterdaou Brutal but satisfying.
@williamlegate He’s Oscar Madison in disguise.
@SallyDeal4 @realDonaldTrump Lots of people are saying that drugs coming over the border are dropped from outer space by women with masking tape around their mouths.
@DonaldJTrumpJr No
@DianaBo89025068 @Litapi1 Where is Howard Schultz?
@docrocktex26 There’s a man who can be trusted to tell the truth about his condition.
@MikeMillerHT No kidding.
@Amy_Siskind Not him.

My heart goes out to the children of Parkland and their families.

@yashar @kasie @morningmika @JoeNBC Hard time admitting a mistake. Trumpian.
@mitchellvii Are you playing Colbert’s old character?
@lisastark351 Except when He does it.
@GovHowardDean Going back? Socialism is the new Communism for wingnuts. Name calling instead of reasoning.
@dailykos @WayneFryback He stayed in character.
@JRubinBlogger Probably not. They’ll just define “unity” as doing what DJT wants, just as he does.
@MichaelJMorell @vickihuddleston One of his best podcasts.
@DrDenaGrayson @pwberg77 He’s just plain weird.
@JoyceWhiteVance More like fly paper. Can’t shake all the investigations.
@jonallendc Says a man who believes in nothing except his own well-being.
@JRubinBlogger @NorahODonnell @jeffglor @VP Yes
@Kokomothegreat @careaware It was the night of the living dead.
@TeamRickandIlsa Great movie. One of our greatest and versatile actresses.
New movie “Isn’t it Romantic” starring DJT and Kim Jung Un.
@costareports More strong leadership from Mittens.
@maxwelltani I’ll never understand why they gave him a job.
@ZekeJMiller Thank God

Ted Cruz with a beard, Rick Perry with glasses. Texas pols are a breed apart. What will John Cornyn do to make him look more serious?
Let’s get this over with.
@kasie Head fake from the beginning.
“...tolerance is cruel.”
Bored by SOTU. Same old, same old. https://t.co/pMKvZQk7h2
@GlennThrush Pence never speaks when DJT is within 5 miles of him.
@NormOrnstein I like beer. Don’t you like beer, Mr. Ornstein?
@burgessev “And I visit them often”.
@CNBC At long last, love up close and personal.
@burgessev They’ll each get about 6 1/2 minutes an hour to expound. Unless they shout over each other.
@jeneps Indirect plagiarism of Obama’s no blue state/red state speech.
DJT SOTU or Zion Williamson?
@jostonjustice @NormOrnstein Never used steroids. Just powerful wrists.
@Patrickesque The issue for Bernie in this short attention span world is being viewed as old news.
@swin24 Somebody is going to get taken to the cleaners on this one.
@business It’s the age of Twitter.
@latimesent @tcm He and Josh Gad did the funniest show together on FX. Unfortunately only one season.
@CHueyBurns They’ll know him once he gets the Oprah touch.
Could be hard to watch if it’s bedtime. https://t.co/GDmLP75u7V
SOTU? Thinking about it. I’ll have to see what’s on the rest of my schedule. I may need Executive Time instead. https://t.co/2JuTVoVIzV
@RBReich His campaign is being run by a conservative Republican who gave us Sarah Palin.
@alexi She’s not a journalist.
@FinancialTimes Then he should be appointed to a “Nationalist” instead.
@CNBC Russia, if you’re listening, go screw yourself.
@tribelaw No LEGO’s. He builds things.
@ESCochrane @JoePerticone @FLOTUS DJT Will probably bully the poor kid too.
@jpaceDC Suppressed laughter too.
@StateDeputySPOX @yashar @SecPompeo @AlinejadMasih Should meet with a jailed Saudi woman activist next.
@HeWhoLovesWords @pwberg77 Must be an incel.
@Independent I’ll do it if they teach me how to do Instagram.
@peterwallsten @jameshohmann @DavidNakamura How can he? He’s in love.
@politico From bad to worse I’m sure.
@kathrynw5 His resignation
@washingtonpost Good. We need him where he is.
@Olivianuzzi @axios Wow. You think should would actually lie?
@howardfineman History is now being taught thematically in high schools rather chronologically. Confusing for most teens.
@jimantle @RobGeorge Big difference. Palin could never have developed.
@newtgingrich The “hate Trump movement” didn’t leak the schedule, someone who works for him in the WH did.
@Tom_Winter Except for the 50’a-60’s Yankees.
@hulu @pwberg77 Smartest commercial of the Super Bowl.

@CapehartJ He probably wasn’t the editor of the yearbook and would have had no say in its layout. But admitting it was him one day and denying it the next is very problematic.

@JoeMyGod All she has to do is ask Mike Huckabee to pay if she can find him.
Steve Schmidt. The pompous political operative who gave us Sarah Palin. Now it’s Howard Schultz.
Steve Schmidt giving disingenuous performance on Deadline. The man who gave us Sarah Palin is at it again.
Don’t screw up my speaking fees.

Trump should know a Foxcon when he sees it.
@DavidWright_CNN And they say Tulsi Gabbard’s campaign is already in trouble.
@joshtpm @brianbeutler Practicing his cliches.

@Brasilmagic @pghdrew She’s after the low-hanging fruit of the gullible Trumpists.
@JoyceCarolOates Not for the self-promoters, the self-important or the bullies. Your fame is well deserved from your accomplishments as a writer.
@jonlovett Early morning waffle(r).
@jonathanalter The self-promotion on here is so rampant.
@DrDenaGrayson They can’t resist a clown.
@realDonaldTrump There is a difference between climate and weather. Ask your client scientists if any are left.
@pattymo @brianbeutler @FuckJerry Fyre Fraud guy?

@JustinZayat @jimcramer @CNBC @jazz3162 Guru? You never held Lehman Brothers stock have you.
@axios But did he understand it?
@JesseLehrich @jonfavs Glad to be on a first name basis, Howard.
@TheStreet @jimcramer @KatherineRooss Talk about Lehman Brothers too.
@espiers @sandynightsky “That’s not who I am” is the usual dead giveaway.
@jimcramer @TiernanRayTech Hold on to Lehman Brothers instead.
@lisastark351 @pghdrew Probably too much caffeine.
@HoarseWisperer @pghdrew But did you read it first?
@washingtonpost And now he’s on ESPN. Go figure.
