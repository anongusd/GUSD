another thing i was working on today https://t.co/Ymc7bLCAxy
to be an artist is to know it's your job to hold up the mirror - even when people are scared to look themselves in the eye
nobody has a right to reach into your chest with their judgement and tell you your heart is wrong ... but they are allowed to challenge you
be in the business of provoking people's underestimation of every single thing you are most beautifully capable of
is there a single word in some language for "kinda feel bad but not really"
the internet broadens our perception,   but shallows our awareness
consider what you can do with a camera and an instantaneous broadband connection
your phone is your most intimate relationship....apologies to the wife
it was very easy to ignore the complexity of the world when we didn't have live global feeds beaming into our pockets
we are finding it increasingly untenable to know that every person on this planet deserves a fair shot
the beauty of what we're finding is that people do care - and they care a lot
i want you to consider how difficult it was in the past to reach out to someone (who cares)
i want you to consider how difficult it was in the past to reach out to someone (to love)
i want you to consider how difficult it was in the past to reach out to someone (for help)
i want you to consider how difficult it was in the past to reach out to someone
i want you to consider the power of what is in your pocket
our ideas can shift at light speed - but it takes a very long time for our cultures to change
the internet is a very new thing ... we don't truly have culture around it yet

You're stating your values whether you like it or not. So be in the business of doing so.
State your values. State your value.
Every note is serious when you're a player
know your power
There is no easy answer. There is no quick solution.
Your freedom means nothing if it is deprived to others elsewhere. It is a cherry on a sundae in a segregated soda fountain in 1950.
"We Cannot Consider Ourselves to be Free Unless Everyone Is Free"
If we do not actively build toward a tomorrow never considered possible, we will backslide to a past where fear was so constant, it was home
If someone tells you this is it, you tell them they are wrong - and show patience until they realize.
Today is merely raw clay upon which to build a better tomorrow - that then again, will be nothing but clay for the next...
"Most of my recent poetic tweets are actually about artificial intelligence. If you can't make it poetic, an idea's weight has no impact"
When I was up at MIT in December, I invited local kids for an impromptu discussion on culture and the future
Most people are well raised enough to know that we each must own the hurt we put out into the world - even if we didn't intend it.
There is always a lot to say, but as we've learned with the internet over and over again - a full plate does not make your mouth any larger
Do not tremble in the corner of the cage when the door swings lithely before you...
We carry almost every answer now in our pockets - yet still cower at the supposed supremacy of others.
We ask for the sky, yet scream at the light for blinding us.
We are hypnotized by artifice upon artifice, yet yearn for the truth.
And - take my word for it - most people who shit on dreams are only doing so because theirs got shat on by someone else.
Expressing one's self ... the joy of connection and creativity ... is merely the furthest frontier of a very long and desperate march
Dreaming is inclusive of yearning ... and there are no people on this planet that did not once yearn to be free, or yearn for a better life
You'd be surprised the number of people who frown at the notion of "pursuing one's dreams" as pure folly
i do many things - always wish to do more - and i have tried a lot of things in the past, if only to know I needn't pursue them further

Our lives are no more benevolent than the support we receive from our friends.
Once we answer those questions - and they are very difficult ones to answer - is really when holistic &amp; sustainable solutions will emerge
We have to ask ourselves: WHY is it that our economic pressure systems allow these behaviors and biases to persist?
Human economies are pressure systems...if we want to change them, we have to observe the fluid dynamics and find where to ease the pressure.
Our economy is created through the collision of numbers and emotion...
You can get into the pits of debating the "waves" of feminism...but to be a feminist is to fundamentally believe in the equality of everyone

The internet was way better when there were no grownups on it.
You have to find a way for your exuberance to fly. To burst forth from you and encircle the stars. Or else, it is some small form of death.
If the distance your true heart and passion travels exceeds any other concern - hustle, desire, fame, success - let your exuberance fly.
And I say "genuinely" very genuinely. You need to weed out superficiality and selfishness before you decide to go very hard for something.
But here's the question - what matters more? What you genuinely care about - or the wall that stands in your way of getting it?
I don't think there's a single thing of value I've ever gotten without sticking my head somewhere where it didn't "belong"

Something shallow can often be more dangerous than something superficial.

Open eyes ... open hearts ... open minds ...
Our human connection is our only connection ... do not disrespect it with blind shouting and clenched eyes and fists.
An open heart alongside an open mind is the only way the world truly changes.
We have the sharpest tool...so let's make the incision with care and precision.
The digital world has opened up a "human window" that benevolent ones have longed to keep open, just as much as tyrants longed to force shut
So let's approach our problems and conflicts with the intimacy, clarity, and speed our digital devices now allow.
We are all children of G-d and are all born innocent. True change cannot happen at the expense of any one individual's dignity.
Wherever you have a problem, merely show up and make your presence known.
Don't overreact, just react.
"I would never get in the way of my kids' dreams" is a relatively recent thing for the average parent to be in the business of saying.

Bring light to people. If they do not know, it's because they cannot see.
Keep your head up and your heart open. We need your good energy for the good work ahead.
Words have power, so save yours for the things that count.
We also need to honor the truths - statistical, demographic, personal - of those who did make it to the top and why.
That past is over and we very explicitly need to be in the business of making up for an abundance of lost time and silenced dreams.
The forces that shaped that past and the stories we tell about it are entirely bound up in how limited our means of communication were.
For every one success story in Hollywood or on Broadway as far back as they have existed, there are a million voiceless unfulfilled dreams.
As we all know, perception and data can often tell quite different stories - and it is any artist's obligation to reconcile the two.
The higher the platform, the higher responsibility...especially in a world where people can do the googling themselves.
...we are all a part of one on-going conversation - of which we are all a party to, and therefore have responsibility as well
Every child born to this earth has dreams they wish to manifest into reality - we are all artists - very much so - in that sense.
...in a world that - prior to the bounty that is the internet - redeemed essentially no one (statistically speaking)
My entire life has been spent in the company of passionate, committed artists yearning to express their voice...
The future is in nobody's hands but yourself...and everyone who you are connected to...which is, um, everybody.
What America needs is an Uncle Ben from Spider-Man, constantly whispering in our stubborn ears "With great power comes great responsibility"
@DanielKirt America inherited the mantle of freedom in this world after WWII and still hasn't fully grappled w/ that responsibility
It's a problem for America when our 14-year olds understand the internet better than our government officials do.

Some evil may be loud, but others are more than happy to settle and hide amongst the color and light.
The absence thereof can leave a vacuum capable of welcoming in evils more profound and insidious than you ever imagined.
And so - we are obliged to infuse our beautiful things with at least the faintest grain of truth.
Our eyes and ears are easily satisfied and easily distracted.
Nothing stable nor beautiful can come to pass in a world dominated by chaos and fear.

A modern religious narrative will always employ tools related to liminality - i.e. the chapters of people's lives, and how they transition
It's fascinating to consider religious narratives. Especially modern ones.
Beyond the suspension of disbelief is the erasure of doubt.
I would venture the purer story is the one that closes all gaps for the listener.
So what is the purer story? The one told by New Guinean tribes people to their children, or the 830pm primetime slot on NBC?

8. Be concerned about the reductive effects of the digital landscape on human consumption.
7. Don't write off Big Hollywood when it comes to changes in media. Yeah they're dinosaurs, but they also have the most to lose.
It is impossible to immerse oneself into intersectional digital landscapes and preserve one's willful ignorance of human suffering.
6. The only way VR can be the future of home entertainment is if there is a sincerely religious revolution in terms of consumption.
5. Is there truly a such thing as a shared experience anymore?
4. How much (if anything) will gatekeepers mean in the future? The Met Gala has kept up, the Oscars, not so much...
3. Innovation is a dangerous theme to pursue in film. By the time it gets to production, there's a good chance it will be irrevocably stale.
2. Doubtful what long form storytelling means to young people. Youtube and Minecraft (yes, Minecraft) are the home of people under 12.
1. Sad that there's really no such thing as a small film anymore. There are medium films, big films, and gigantic films...that's it.
Here are some thoughts from the last few weeks of meetings:
People consistently underestimate the difference between analog and digital culture.
And by "singularity", I most specifically mean a point of no return which many people cannot see beyond.
If we use concepts of singularity" as metaphor, let's entertain the notion that a series of cultural singularities have started to emerge.
I never thought I'd witness a massive paradigm shift in culture...let alone worry about what side I'm on.
What the world does to you and what you do to others are trains that run closely on separate tracks.
TMI, I know - and not even advertising this for them. It's more just a question of being honest and honorable.
I just did and holy shit was I a jerk to someone I care a lot about.
If anyone ever accuses you of being a jerk, read back over at least year of text messages before responding.
They ask you to put your phones away during the pre-movie ads. No England, sorry.
I can already tell it's going to be weird watching "Captain America" in London.
People ask me if I'm crazy, then I remind them of the time I was on 16 flights in 29 days.
If anyone is confused on my philosophical stance on the responsibilities of producing popular art, read Caryl Churchill's "Far Away"
I spent five years of my professional life working on plays and musicals, yet pretty much left it heartbroken.
I miss being in love with the theater
Highlight of the day: having to explain to someone not born in the USA what blackface was üò∂
when doves cry was on my mind all day, i didn't have to turn the radio on
i think that's all i have to say about it...prince has been on the playlist since the weekend
that was 1987 and on a pop album....reagan was in office. nobody talked about hard drug addiction in the top 40.
"In September, my cousin tried reefer for the very first time	Now he's doing horse - it's June"
also also there's a line in "sign o the times" that has always broken my heart:
beyond that - i just seriously think "I wanna be your lover" and "when doves cry" are just like fucking endlessly brilliant songs
and this is in the 80s, when there was no internet, there was no popular counterculture
he understood what everyone's comfort zone was, and then gently coaxed them out of it
prince shredded at the top of "when doves cry" so bros could be cool with the song
prince made you believe that your romance could be the most important, the most tragic, the most sincere...
prince's music was filled with pathos, tragedy, drama, heart, sensitivity
and i don't say that in a facetious way...
he convinced an entire generation that - regardless of how sexy you've been led to believe - you...as in ANYBODY...can be a fucking sex god
not only did he convince an entire generation of teens that a 5'2", falsetto singing, high heel wearing minnesotan could be a sex symbol
and i think growing up and realizing that you're going to have to (ahem) sing for your supper, something more profound happened within him
like three inches taller than danny devito tiny
also - no way around it - dude was tiny
never forget this was at the same time that Michael was battling to get his videos onto MTV
and this was at a time when the lines were drawn very firmly between the genres
prince happily mixed metal, r&amp;b, soul, rock, disco, glam, and whatever fucking else he wanted to - without apology
i get the feeling that - at least as a musician - prince was raised as a liberated person
It's also - as I understand - a northern city with a pretty strong and long record of integration - not only in community but also music
i talk to my friends who have lived there, and that's the prevailing sentiment - you don't need anyone else's love, Minneapolis is enough
here was a guy who grew up in a town that needs no qualifications from the rest of the country: Minneapolis
for what it's worth in a sea of comments and criticism, here are my thoughts on what made prince important:
i also think it shielded him from the rot of old videos and looks - which - while were cool at the time, didn't necessarily age well
the thing about prince and his withholding of his content online is that it super helped build up his myth

i'm not a christian, but i think John 1:1 says basically everything about everything
any experience that deprives you of your dignity is not worthwhile
i love nightclubs as intersectional spaces, but I'd never wait outside of one longer than 5 minutes
i also realized recently that I went to a high school that did not have a top-down popularity hierarchy - which apparently is rare

I can't believe I'm listening to a Neil Degrasse Tyson diss track right now
But that means everyone making $35,000-$75,000 a year....we're not talking million dollar paychecks.
I'm sure there's an ecosystem where thousands more can make a living making content...self-generated, self-produced content.
I have faith in the future of social media empowered content...but that also means some harder truths: no more big paydays.
How do you address these questions of fairness amicably?
We live in a society where essentially everyone wants to be a creative.
What concerns me is people don't realize wielding culture has always been an act of war in America.
And I'm an empirical dude...i want thorough solutions.
I'm just living life in search of satisfying social constructs.
It makes me feel like a crazy person, but every conversation I have each day just lets me know I'm not alone.
I don't understand why we have the tools and the technology and we don't ask the deep questions. I really don't.
How can we fairly address the wounds of all that time when we did not know better ... nor could do better even if we wanted to?
It's difficult, because as easy as it may now be to trace ourselves back to the beginning...all of us brothers and sisters.
And stop the theft of language and culture that has been happening - purposefully or by default - the entire time
This is the first moment we have the means to understand these terrible instincts ... instincts that we have never had the means to regulate
The list goes on and on.
They spoke a Celtic language...which was then wiped out by a Germanic language...which was then colonized by a Romance language.
Nobody spoke "English" in England 2,500 years ago.
The Bantu Expansion - https://t.co/BOWVpBwt6o - signaled the end of the prev. languages in these regions, as herding culture moved south
The majority of languages in Central and Southern Africa are called Bantu - a language group that originated in Western Africa
And that France used to have over 20 languages spoken daily, until post-Revolutionary authorities set out on a program to eradicate them.
I remember how shocked I was to learn that at one time, French wasn't even the majority language in France: https://t.co/vQRcNwt8n0
I say this, because a broader reading of history only points to one larger point: we have been doing this to each other the entire time.
There is no corner of this globe that has been spared the wrath of these deep, dark human instincts
To murder, conquer, ethnically cleanse, and genocide is - unfortunately - a universal human impulse.
And it's only when you delve into the specifics that the greater truths emerge...
Specifically in a way that prevents us from having a more nuanced approach...one that can afford more sympathy and human connection
But because the dialogue automatically leans toward the emotional - specifically the outrage - and not the intellectual discourse...
Not because insane historical wrongs are being corrected as quickly as we can get to them...
As well-intentioned as it may be, the hyper-reactionism enabled by the internet troubles me more and more every day.
@BVincentChick ultimately, yes - it's unavoidable + we are incapable of enforcing noble values without human prejudice getting in the way
Should A.I. be used to dispense fairness - beyond what well-intentioned human beings are capable of?

"Take Me to Church" is an awesome example. There are a billion poetic layers, but the song works on a pop level...
If you want people to like a poetic song outside of English majors and critics, you essentially have to include an index "within" the lyric
If you write a song in a teenage voice, be prepared for listeners to engage with it that way.
Consider the age of the lyric. How old is the "voice" of the song?
It doesn't matter how fresh it seems now. That freshness will melt away, and all you will have is an infection in the form of terrible words
If it occurs to you that a lyric may be taken as completely idiotic by someone at some point, it will

Man, growing up as the weird kid who only knew 2-3 people with the same name, it means so much having @elonmusk in the news.

Sweet. Only took @Slate an hour: http://t.co/u4BErewGML
In the meantime, chill. She looks great.
I'm pretty disgusted by the unspoken sexism of all of these Renee Zellwegger posts, and once @Slate writes a piece on it, you will be too.
It's a callous, transgressive, academic exercise. Why don't you try and look for the heart of the internet if you're going to gut it?
My biggest problem with @BuzzFeed is they cynically take all of the fun out of discovering things on the internet.
@HudMo @BoyGeorge this whole exchange is just making me very very happy
Apparently @BuzzFeed is a religious blog for its columnists now. Really glad journalistic ethics got left behind in the 20th century.

@ClayBujorian good thing no one bet me money http://t.co/rjl2vrfJzZ
But I do know I have a pretty salty taste in my mouth the moment the masses coagulate to remember someone they only loved for his highs.
I know nothin of him personally, what pain he suffered, or what led his career decisions.
Or when a generation just moves on?
Yet did we all, who fawn over Mork, or Genie, or Doubtfire, consider the psychological erosion that happens when your audiences leave you?
He tried. Over and over again. Making solid hits, even a few amazing home runs (I return to "World's Greatest Dad")
Absolutely not.
But did the millions who adored him for his classic performances follow him on his post-pop journey into more challenging work?
For anyone who saw "World's Greatest Dad" or him on Broadway a few years back in "Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo"
Robin Williams hadn't had a solid hit since the late 90s, yet still insisted on being vibrant, experimental, boundary challenging
You want to know what I think.

@vimota @elonmusk ...I would just do it slowly, cautiously, and with great care taken to the importance of human society and culture
@vimota @elonmusk not saying we couldn't slowly move toward a cracking open of human intelligence and consciousness...
@vimota @elonmusk almost everything we perceive is dictated by subconscious processing - our conscious minds are just a buoy on a large sea
@vimota @elonmusk my only issue with this is that it is your evolved brain that is making that distinction
@vimota @elonmusk ...what we find to be fundamentally human. On a pure data level. That correlates to the authentic, ideal human experience.
@vimota @elonmusk I'm not particularly concerned. Because the crisis of singularity will only force us to further define and defend...
@vimota @elonmusk And so if the fear of suprahuman AI is that it will act in fundamentally "un-human" ways that could spell our doom...
@vimota @elonmusk EVERYTHING we do as a species cannot be separated from the conditions in which we evolved.
@vimota @elonmusk the only reasonable approach is to embrace the fundamental human-ness of the endeavor.
@vimota @elonmusk When confronted with the potential crisis of a human designed device potentially capable of suprahuman activity...
@vimota @elonmusk ...correlates to exact "settings" that our brains evolved to identify as favorable survival triggers.
@vimota @elonmusk Savannah Hypothesis posits that the fundamental way in which we, as a species, construct our societies...
The answer to Singularity issues is the Savanna Hypothesis. ITS NOT THAT COMPLICATED. #SorryWorryWarts http://t.co/83h2htap5m @elonmusk

I wasn't a kid when I was a kid, so don't ask me to be a grown up now
that's not the world i live in / no one is ever too long gone
said he'd never find a home / he was too long gone
they put him down without telling me / had to show up monday to find out
took him to a trainer / was great with him / bit his wife
escaped first day we got him / ran through midtown without getting hit
someone kept him as a guard dog / he only knew how to love his owner
he was smart as fuck / too smart for his own good
parrafin skin / tears easily
loved you to death / mauled the old people in the lobby
he was the sweetest dog / had a scar across his snout
In my old office, we adopted a german shepherd / rottweiler mix
