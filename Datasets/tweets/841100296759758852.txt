RUSSIA FIRST! america thurd. https://t.co/GbkzWj3awH
I have been FAR more lenient on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton. Maybe more so than any other President. At the same time, &amp; as I have often said, getting along with Russia is a good thing. I fully expect that someday we will MAKE RUSSIA GREAT AGAIN! #MAGA or #MRGA? https://t.co/e0lab0lX5k
