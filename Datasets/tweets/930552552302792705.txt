@ColumbiaBugler That‚Äôs exactly where these numbers came from. That‚Äôs my whole point. This plan came from years of analysis by DHS. I‚Äôm trying to help people understand that.
@lokibeat That is part of the #2 option. I would encourage everyone to research the actual plan proposed by the President. It includes more immigration judges and more detention facilities sonwe can adjudicate cases much faster. It‚Äôs a holistic solution.
Border security, the actual choices:		1. Status quo, with 400,000 illegals apprehended per year.		2. Dept of Homeland Security Request: 234 miles of new fencing where they‚Äôve identified a need, plus other tech.  $5.7 B price tag		3. 2,000 mile wall, $25 B price tag		We choose #2
@notherelater @RepDanCrenshaw His district covers sectors of the border with natural barricades and very little traffic. I would urge Will to think of the border in holistic terms instead of just his district. The President‚Äôs plan only calls for fencing where BP has identified a need. Not the whole border

@bondcliff @hm_roth @RepDanCrenshaw That‚Äôs why the President‚Äôs plan calls for walls in certain places that Border Patrol has identified, technology in other locations, and reforms to asylum process that reduce incentives. This is not a ‚Äúsea to shining sea‚Äù border wall proposal.
@muchojordan @RepDanCrenshaw @nwlaguy Yes Jordan, that‚Äôs exactly what these stats are telling us. All of the arrests in this sector, 94%, occur where there is no wall. The wall in the eastern side (same terrain) results in dramatically less crossings.

@AmberSmithUSA It‚Äôs a ‚Äútalking point‚Äù with a very real understanding of a simple truth: you keep pressure on an enemy that desires nothing more than to attack your homeland. We have a small special operations force, not a nation building army. It‚Äôs the right balance.
@JGenius9 @rascalhere @RandPaul We get involved because if we don‚Äôt, they will identify ways to attack a free and open society. The President has thus far found the right balance: avoid nation building while maintaining small special operations presence to keep pressure on a very much alive enemy.
@JGenius9 @rascalhere @RandPaul It saddens me that Americans believe this. Why did Osama commit 9/11? We helped him against the Soviets and defended his homeland, Saudi Arabia. He did it because his ideology tells him to. The idea that ‚Äúwe started it‚Äù is patently false.
