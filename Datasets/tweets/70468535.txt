Happy second Sunday of Advent everyone! 		The Gospel is the good news of Jesus Christ - that He came into the world to save us, He gave His life as a sacrifice for our sins so we may be forgiven and healed, and that we are made for eternal joy in Heaven with Him.
It‚Äôs easy to care about human rights abuses far away from the comfort of our homes and not get out and face the evil in our own cities.		The greatest evil is often the most hidden and accepted.		Until we stop killing our children in our own communities we will never have peace.

Our response to growing population should never be to kill humans.		The planet is a gift to us &amp; we should be good stewards of it.

Public policy can only go so far in solving the problems in our society.		Laws matter, but what matters most is the human heart.		Do we see each human as made in God's image, full of dignity?		Do we strive to know the truth? Do we trust that God is good and loving?
Abortion destroys dreams.	It destroys opportunities.	It destroys happiness.	It says "this situation is hopeless."	It says "you don't have what it takes."	It offers a child's death as the path to survival.		It's all a total, rotten lie. And America's women are beginning to see it.

Millions of women weren‚Äôt dying before Roe v. Wade.		Maternal deaths from illegal abortion: 		1950: ~300 deaths		1965: Under 200 deaths		1972: 39 deaths from illegal abortion; 24 deaths from LEGAL abortion		1973: 19 deaths from illegal abortion; 25 deaths from LEGAL abortion
Did you know?		"Fetus" means "offspring" in Latin.		Calling a preborn child a "fetus" doesn't change her humanity. 		Humans can only beget humans.		A zygote, embryo, fetus, infant, toddler are stages of human development. 		Being less developed doesn't mean you're less human.
Abortion pill reversal has saved over 500 children!		Doctors can reverse the effects of the first of two abortion pills if medical assistance is sought early.		Women often regret their abortions, and they deserve to know all their options.		Learn more at: https://t.co/VGSzlqP5P7

Legalizing abortion DID NOT make it "safer" for women. It only made it more deadly for preborn children.		Contrary to pro-abortion claims, millions of women weren't dying from illegal abortions before Roe v. Wade.		Here are the facts: https://t.co/l7MlREASK1

To be clear, Planned Parenthood leaders Alan Guttmacher and Mary S. Calderone have said that abortion is not medically necessary to save the life of the mother, and the Richard Dawkins Foundation @rdfrs is calling these statements "100% BS." https://t.co/ecqjuFAfv6
.@SenFeinstein claimed that before Roe, "200,000 to 1.2 million" women died from illegal abortions.		It's an outright lie &amp; scare tactic.		@NARAL co-founder Bernard Nathanson admitted stats were wildly inflated to push for legal abortion. 		There were "300 or so deaths" annually.

The "I'm personally opposed to abortion" argument is like saying:		"I'm personally opposed to slavery, but people should be free to own slaves."		"I'm personally opposed to murder, but people should be free to kill others."		There is NO middle ground for any human rights abuse.
There is no "right-wing"or "left-wing" Catholicism. There is only the Truth on faith and morals, which you can learn about in Holy Scripture, encyclicals, and other magisterial documents. The only "factions" in the Church are manmade, as a result of our sin and selfish pursuits.
Nine years ago, I became Catholic with full knowledge of the Church's history. There has been sin in the highest offices of the Church (starting with Judas &amp; Peter), yet Christ never abandons His Church. Her teachings &amp; sacraments have guided and nourished us for 2000 years.

@SgtElzetta I‚Äôm grateful for the hard work of the original feminists to secure our right to vote and improve access to education. Many of these early feminists were motivated by their Christian faith, because our faith teaches us that men and women are equal in dignity before God.
Original feminism (a political movement) was intended to be an equalizer for men and women to be treated with equal dignity by our laws and institutions. 		It‚Äôs become a cultural movement to denigrate men, mock sexual morality, and celebrate abortion.

Marriage is not the solution for pederasty or pedophilia. Marriage is a vocation, like the priesthood, and sexual deviancy and abuse do not belong in marriage anymore than they belong in the priesthood. Celibacy and chastity are not the problem - they are part of the answer. https://t.co/OEXg3sJxkQ
The coverup by Bishops and the pederasty and abuse by priests is sickening and satanic. This evil in our Church must be exposed and rooted out. They do not represent the dozens of good, wise, holy priests I know, and they are the antithesis of Christ‚Äôs design for our Church.

In the U.S., it is considered abuse if a parent withholds food, care, protection, or emotional support from a child. 		However, if the child is in the womb, it's considered "a right" for a mother to pay an abortionist to dismember, poison, or starve the baby to death.
The "my body, my choice" argument denies science. 		To say the child is the mother's body would mean the woman has: 		2 types of DNA	2 blood types	2 heartbeats	4 arms	4 eyes	4 ears		The fact is, abortion always kills one and wounds others.

This is why I love groups like https://t.co/2PboTsBTkB and @femmhealth. They work hard to empower girls with education about their cycles. Instead exasperating hormonal imbalance, Femm acknowledges fertility as a sign of health &amp; works to correct underlying problems. (3/3)
Synthetic hormones are prescribed as a panacea for painful periods, acne &amp; other problems. 	Instead of treating underlying causes, these drugs mask the causes &amp; create new problems. 	Meanwhile, teens don‚Äôt have healthy hormone balance &amp; don‚Äôt learn how their cycles work. (2/3)
Today, many teen girls are put on synthetic drugs that suppress their natural hormone levels. These drugs cause health problems, including depression, anxiety, blood clots &amp; higher risk for cancer. This has practically become a rite of age for thousands of American girls. (1/3)

FACT: At fertilization, the entire genetic makeup of a unique human being is formed, including sex, eye color, and other traits. 		The only difference between a human at fertilization, the 4-month-old child in utero, the toddler, and a person at 17, 35, or 80 is age.

And in 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Roe v. Wade that "the word 'person' as used in the 14th Amendment, does not include the unborn." Calling any living human a 'non-person' is historically dangerous and causes widespread genocide. (4/4)
In 1936, the German Supreme Court stated, "The Reichsgericht itself refused to recognize Jews ... as 'persons' in the legal sense." In 1909, a British voting rights case said, "The statutory word 'person' did not in these circumstances include women." (3/4)
In 1856, the Virginia Supreme Court said, "In the eyes of the law ... the slave is not a person." In 1861, the American Law Review published an article that said, "An Indian is not a person within the meaning of the Constitution." (2/4)
Calling any living human a non-person is a dehumanization tactic that takes lives. History proves this out. Today, some say preborn children are "non-persons." In the early 1900s, Soviets called their enemies "unpersons who had never existed." (1/4)

A medical abortion starves a preborn child to death in utero. During this point in pregnancy, the baby already has a beating heart, tiny fingers and toes, and a developing body.
California is putting the life and health of young girls at risk by seeking to distribute abortion pills on college campuses. Generally one of two abortion pills is taken by the woman without medical supervision, and combined, have significant side effects and failure rates.
