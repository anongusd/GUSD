#Arq now have six 415hp air compressors installed at #Corbin. They'll pump 1k standard cubic feet of air per minute at 100psi to create tiny bubbles in the separation cells, helping separate micro-fine hydrocarbon from minerals and ash. 	#EnergyUnbound #Technology #Innovation https://t.co/yZw7z9KSzz
https://t.co/6UxzKEwUeO	Arq Technology  is a complex process that transforms the environmental liability of coal mining discard. To help simplify what we do, this useful video breaks the process down into separate stages.	#EnergyUnbound #ArqFuel #CorbinKY
To operate at capacity, Arq's plant in Corbin (KY) needs 20k hp. Arq's maintenance manager and twelve highly skilled electricians have  installed several miles of conduit to protect our power and instrumentation cables. #EnergyUnbound #ArqFuel #CorbinKY #Technology #Innovation https://t.co/vzqs2FwohQ
Like an industrial Dyson, using centrifugal force, #Arq classifying cyclones create a vortex to separate water and inorganic matter (which drops out of the bottom) from pure hydrocarbons (which are pulled through the top) to flow through the process.	#ArqFuel #EnergyUnbound https://t.co/Bd7hTH1vmP
Sir Mick Davis joins energy technology company Arq as a non-executive director on its Board.	Sir Mick commented: “This break-through technology will help to provide an immediate solution for a number of key global energy issues.”	https://t.co/xjtcTKgwYq 	#Arq #EnergyUnbound https://t.co/kNaWYQT0ml

Update from #CorbinKY. Our new log washer sits right at the start of the Feed Control Unit (which is now complete) to scrub off materials like tough insoluble clays, conglomerates, soft stone and aggregates from our feedstock.

The front end of the Arq Plant in Corbin, KY, the Feed Control Unit (FCU), is substantially complete. The main processing plant, the Fuel Processing Unit, is also under construction and we expect to finish and commission these units by early next year. 	#ArqFuel #EnergyUnbound https://t.co/gxF2Z3RQB1
Installation #Arq micro-milling technology and machinery at #Corbin is another example of how Arq use proven technologies but apply them differently. Micro-milling will help Arq reduce pure hydrocarbons to the microfine sizes needed for #ArqFuel . 	#EnergyUnbound https://t.co/DLMK3wQ50L
