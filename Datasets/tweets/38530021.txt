Tests that examine the liver and the blood are used to detect (find) and diagnose adult primary liver cancer.
The most common type of adult primary liver cancer is hepatocellular carcinoma. This type of liver cancer is the third-leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.
The hepatitis A vaccine and the hepatitis B vaccine prevent infection with hepatitis A and hepatitis B. There is no vaccine to prevent infection with hepatitis C. If a person has had one type of hepatitis in the past, it is still possible to get the other types.
Being infected with certain types of the hepatitis virus can cause hepatitis and increase the risk of liver cancer.

@WayneLiangMD @AACR We are sorry about the technical difficulties. Here is a summary of ideas in the talk from NCI's Cancer Currents blog: https://t.co/yuLtuOa02K
New #immunotherapy drug simultaneously targets two proteins that block the body's immune response against tumors: https://t.co/nuPkodR4S9 https://t.co/smzq7wtURO
NCI has launched an effort to help early-stage investigators by extending the length of time they can receive funding under their first independent #NIH grant, explains @NCIDirector https://t.co/i7QoKIM0hR https://t.co/MECWw1xcqR
NCI Director Dr. Ned Sharpless shares his vision of opportunities to accelerate progress in #CancerResearch and patient care: https://t.co/yuLtuOa02K #NCIfuture #AACR18 https://t.co/0GQd1M6WIR
We have already made tremendous progress since the "bad old days," when we did not understand much about the biology of many cancers. We now need to work together to realize the promise of cancer research for our patients. - @NCIDirector #AACR18
NCI's Community Oncology Research Program brings clinical trials to people in their communities https://t.co/QeuJoq9qhc #AACR18 https://t.co/l2pnmi4ewA
We need to think about #ClinicalTrials differently and see drug development through the lens of a health-service researcher. We also need to use the tools of big data and data aggregation. - @NCIDirector #AACR18
"We are now in the era of precision oncology," but this has created challenges in cancer clinical trials, including issues related to costs. So how can NCI help modernize #ClinicalTrials? - @NCIDirector #AACR18
"We need to change our practices to reward and incentivize #datasharing and aggregation, for example, by making aggregation possible by smart consenting and good trial design." - @NCIDirector #AACR18
"Whichever area you are studying in cancer, #BigData will help." -  @NCIDirector #AACR18
"NCI will be putting another $100M into investigator-initiated science in 2018. This is the largest increase to the RPG pool since 2003." @NCIDirector #AACR18 #basicscience
A third of all cancers are driven by mutations in the RAS family of genes. NCI's RAS Initiative is investigating: https://t.co/ivMvLbibAK #AACR18 https://t.co/BrzL2mLt4F
We need a better basic understanding of the biology of some diseases. And we need this to make progress against some intractable cancers. "Basic science offers us hope in these areas." @NCIDirector #AACR18
We need to ensure the diversity of the #CancerResearch workforce and support early-stage investigators. - @NCIDirector #AACR18
We need to be training people with the right skills for cancer research. One of our most important jobs at NCI is to ensure a talented and innovative research workforce for the decades ahead. - @NCIDirector #AACR18
We now know that cancer is not one disease, but rather hundreds of diseases. And this has implications for how we approach #cancerresearch. - @NCIDirector #AACR18
"I know each of you here today shares the mission, the passion for cancer research. Together we can get this done." - @NCIDirector #AACR18
But it was really his interactions with patients who had cancer that taught him about the need to develop better ways to treat cancer. - @NCIDirector #AACR18
"I loved biomedical research from the beginning... I was really interested in what was going on in science" - @NCIDirector #AACR18
Dr. Sharpless thanks advocates for #cancerresearch and also survivors of cancer and patients. "Your experiences are the ones that ultimately matter the most." #AACR18
The talk by Dr. Sharpless is called "NCI and the Cancer Community: Focusing on Patients Through Innovative Research" #AACR18
