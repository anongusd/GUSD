@dahlia1516 @RepKevinBrady Not one person has gone without a paycheck yet. They're not due a paycheck until Friday. Quit parroting bullshit. Furthermore, if missing one paycheck creates a hardship for them, it might be a wake-up call that they need to learn how to live on less than what they make.

@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump FACT: The U.S. taxpayers and the federal government DID their part. The corrupt local government in Puerto Rico did nothing for the people before, during or after Maria. They shouldn't get another dime of taxpayer money until they vote them out.

@MacEnvy Spare me, Useless. You think we were done in 2016? We were just getting started. You underestimate us now just as you did then. More Democrats will be voted out in November and more again in 2010. Go cheer Reid's "rule change" now.

@MacEnvy Imagine being so ill-informed that you don't know #Tennessee has a budget surplus, fully funded + education spending increase, no state income tax, no state property tax, no "death" tax, lowest unemployment rate and a booming jobs market.		Or, is that what you consider "corrupt"?

@MacEnvy The corrupt local government in Puerto Rico are the disgusting, inhuman pieces of shit. You are as well, for enabling them and not holding them accountable for their selfishness and dereliction at the expense of the people.		Idiot.
@KevT510 @nosoupforgeorge He became one the moment he decided to exact revenge on innocent people for whatever his perceived injustice was, and you don't know that 6 people would still be alive. You're guessing and you still haven't addressed the criminal element. 		Shocking!		Lazy bastard.

@Lor_blueeyes @RealCandaceO @libertyryver @RealOmarNavarro @charliekirk11 @RepMaxineWaters @realDonaldTrump Then until you can define what a "foreigner" is, refrain from using the word. 		Idiot.
@Lor_blueeyes @RealCandaceO @libertyryver @RealOmarNavarro @charliekirk11 @RepMaxineWaters @realDonaldTrump I believe BOTH should be taught, you ignorant cur. YOU are more concerned with that than ACADEMICS, which you sorely lack, and the trade classes that we once had until liberals took over the school systems and pushed "college for everyone" rather than actual education and skills.
@Lor_blueeyes @RealCandaceO @libertyryver @RealOmarNavarro @charliekirk11 @RepMaxineWaters @realDonaldTrump LMAO!  Again you cry about disparity while touting the very bureaucracy that was enacted by the liberal idiots to "cure" the "disparities" state by state. 	You're done here. It's obvious you never graduated high school and if you did, you were socially promoted, not academically.
@Lor_blueeyes @RealCandaceO @libertyryver @RealOmarNavarro @charliekirk11 @RepMaxineWaters @realDonaldTrump AGAIN - What grade did you complete in school, where and what year?
@muftasin Correct. We have a Constitution that addresses our rights and the protection of them. The UN does not.
@Lor_blueeyes @RealCandaceO @libertyryver @RealOmarNavarro @charliekirk11 @RepMaxineWaters @realDonaldTrump I'll accept that as your admission that you can't define "foreigners".  Not surprising.	We're the United States of America, not the United Nations.  Again, stick to FACTS or move on.
@Lor_blueeyes @RealCandaceO @libertyryver @RealOmarNavarro @charliekirk11 @RepMaxineWaters @realDonaldTrump LMAO! You prove that you haven't got a clue that the Constitution restricts government, not the people. Again, what grade did you complete in school, where and what year was that?
@Lor_blueeyes @RealCandaceO @libertyryver @RealOmarNavarro @charliekirk11 @RepMaxineWaters @realDonaldTrump Then you establish those rules, guidelines and expectations in YOUR STATE for YOUR children. What part of that is so hard for you to grasp?		YOU don't make that determination for other states whose concerns are the lack of academics and trade classes. Control your control issues.
@Lor_blueeyes @RealCandaceO @libertyryver @RealOmarNavarro @charliekirk11 @RepMaxineWaters @realDonaldTrump Define "foreigners".  Do you mean illegal aliens or those who came here LEGALLY? Those who are here illegally should not be educated at taxpayer expense. They should be sent home and come here the right way.
@Lor_blueeyes @RealCandaceO @libertyryver @RealOmarNavarro @charliekirk11 @RepMaxineWaters @realDonaldTrump Guidelines as determined by you? Spare me. Hell, you think there's such a thing as separation of church and state. It's obvious you're a product of that DoE you profess to need. How embarrassing for you.
@Lor_blueeyes @RealCandaceO @libertyryver @RealOmarNavarro @charliekirk11 @RepMaxineWaters @realDonaldTrump You insult yourself. I'm simply not allowing you to assign words or beliefs to me that I never expressed. Again, there is no such thing as separation of church and state. The ony place you'll find that term is in a letter from Jefferson to the Baptists. Deal in facts or move on.
@Lor_blueeyes @RealCandaceO @libertyryver @RealOmarNavarro @charliekirk11 @RepMaxineWaters @realDonaldTrump Your illiteracy is showing again. Nowhere did I say that "others" don't deserve school. Good grief.  What's the highest grade you completed in school and where?
@Cooper19874 @wogdoggy @SenatorDurbin Don't be such a moron. Everything that anyone's been treated for under "cover-everything" Obamacare, is a pre-existing condition now. You knew that when you voted for it, and voted for it anyway. "Pre-existing condition" doesn't make them more special than the next guy anymore.
@Lor_blueeyes @RealCandaceO @libertyryver @RealOmarNavarro @charliekirk11 @RepMaxineWaters @realDonaldTrump There's no such thing as "separation of Church and State", you poorly-educated twit. The only place you'll find that is in a letter by Thomas Jefferson to the Baptists. Spare me the "stupid talk".	Your bigotry and emotion seems to dictate your decision-making. That's unfortunate.
@Lor_blueeyes @RealCandaceO @libertyryver @RealOmarNavarro @charliekirk11 @RepMaxineWaters @realDonaldTrump Because the DoE has done such a great job that you cry about education disparity.		Good grief.
@Lor_blueeyes @RealCandaceO @libertyryver @RealOmarNavarro @charliekirk11 @RepMaxineWaters @realDonaldTrump So you admit that the NATIONAL Department of Education is a failure.		Tell me, how much MORE do you think "per pupil" would be if the D.C. middle man was eliminated (including the salaries, etc.) and those funds actually SPENT in the states they were raised in, on students?

@Lor_blueeyes @RealCandaceO @libertyryver @RealOmarNavarro @charliekirk11 @RepMaxineWaters @realDonaldTrump No, half-wit. Your DoE did that. Prior to that we taught academics and ALL children were held to the same standards. And they were educated, not "taught to the test". Again, learn to read.
@Lor_blueeyes @RealCandaceO @libertyryver @RealOmarNavarro @charliekirk11 @RepMaxineWaters @realDonaldTrump Are you kidding me? Good grief. That was the DoE's determination and was instituted in all public schools nationwide. Your "national" school system.		Again, come back when you learn to read properly, and have a clue what you're talking about, and try again.

@Lor_blueeyes @RealCandaceO @libertyryver @RealOmarNavarro @charliekirk11 @RepMaxineWaters @realDonaldTrump Yes. Ebonics. The DoE's excuse to dumb down the English language to accommodate those whom they determined couldn't graduate otherwise. In other words, they determined black people were too intellectually inferior to learn English properly and would hold the class/school back.
@Lor_blueeyes @RealCandaceO @libertyryver @RealOmarNavarro @charliekirk11 @RepMaxineWaters @realDonaldTrump What part of "the curriculum would be up to the states" don't you get? Do you not understand the reason for that? PARENTS would have a VOICE in what their children are taught. The is answerable to them. If they want creationism over 50 genders and a condom, that's their choice.
@Lor_blueeyes @RealCandaceO @libertyryver @RealOmarNavarro @charliekirk11 @RepMaxineWaters @realDonaldTrump 2) This would eliminate things like "ebonics as a second language" and "teaching to the test". A return to educating is what's needed, not the dumbing down of students, as has been the case since the DoE was established.
@Lor_blueeyes @RealCandaceO @libertyryver @RealOmarNavarro @charliekirk11 @RepMaxineWaters @realDonaldTrump üòñ   The curriculum would be up to the individual state to determine, with education funds raised at the STATE and local level and KEPT THERE, rather than being sent to D.C. for redistribution. It would NOT be determined by D.C. which has proven to be a failure for 40 years.

@SenateDems @SenBlumenthal Nope. You changed the rules in 2011 to silence us. We don't give a damn what you want now. #Kavanaugh will be confirmed, there's no need for him to recuse himself, and there's nothing you can do about it.	#WhatsAtStake
@liberalinsf @SenFeinstein There is nothing they can do. They changed the rules in 2011 to silence the minority. As a result, they don't have the votes they need to stop the Kavanaugh confirmation, hence the lip service. He'll be confirmed and there's nothing they can do to stop it.
@historBilia @SenFeinstein Since when is lip service to fool the base "an excellent job"? They changed the rules in 2011 to silence the majority. As a result, they don't have the votes to stop the Kavanaugh confirmation. He'll be confirmed and they can do NOTHING but lie to their ignorant voting base.
@mallen2010 @SenFeinstein Exactly! The morons who vote for her don't get it. It's almost hysterical to watch.
@WobblyGenius @SenFeinstein @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski Why? They can't stop this either. Democrats changed the rules in 2011 to silence the minority. They don't have the votes to stop the Kavanaugh nomination because of that. He'll be confirmed and there's nothing they can do about it.
@SenFeinstein You mean like you continue to fool your base with this lip service? You changed the rule in 2011 to silence the minority. As a result, you don't have the votes to stop Kavanaugh. You count on your base being too stupid to know this. Kavanaugh will be confirmed. You can't stop it.
@sandeehuynh @RepJudyChu LMAO! Right. A book full of unsubstantiated claims about people who deny the claims made in the book.		She can't support the claim SHE made here. She's a drama queen playing to the emotions and stupidity of a base that never learned to think for themselves.
@womensmarch And you're too damn stupid to realize that #Democrats changed the rules in 2011 to silence the minority and now they don't have the votes to stop the #Kavanaugh confirmation. He'll be confirmed and there's nothing you, or they, can do about it.		Idiots.
@RepJudyChu Support your claim. Oh, wait. You can't. Why? Because there's no damn source.		Drama queen. This is nothing but shit disturbing and it's getting old. November can't come soon enough. Time to kick more of you to the curb. 2016 was a good start. That's all it was.

@LPOB65 @SenFeinstein Says the one encouraging obstruction. 		Good grief. You still have no clue why you really lost in 2016, do you?
@Pinozoni @SenFeinstein üòÇü§£üòÇ How does that change the fact that they don't have the votes to stop it?
@ArrestTraitors @SenFeinstein What would be the basis of the that suit?	"Despite more being released on Kavanaugh's record than any other; despite Reid changing the rules; despite Kagan's mid-term confirmation, we want to obstruct because we don't have the votes and don't want to admit that to our supporters?
@JoseyRider @SenFeinstein Nothing but thank Harry Reid. They don't have the votes to stop it and the GOP Senators know that liberal shitstains don't vote for them. They know their voters support #Kavanaugh.	I guess @Feinstein and left that part out. Kavanaugh will be confirmed before midterms.
@BarbL219 @SenFeinstein @TrappdInTheEcho Except, they're not breaking the rules. Harry Reid changed the rule despite being told not to. You, and @SenateDems don't like playing by your own rules. Tough shit.
@stephenrichter6 @thinkblue2 @SenFeinstein You're every bit as stupid. The reason he will be confirmed is because Harry Reid changed the rules despite being told it was a mistake. Democrats thought they'd never lose another election. They underestimated the voters they'd pissed off for a decade.		Go back to school.
@SeanFine27 @SenFeinstein @DrRhondaFine LMAO!  You still have no clue why you really lost in 2016, do you? It's the same reason more #Democrats will be voted out in November. Obstruction. Did you think we were finished in 2016? We were just getting started. That wasn't a "one-and-done" endeavor.
@wendy_mcroberts @SenFeinstein @tedcruz @JohnCornyn @GOP @BetoORourke Aw, what's the matter? You don't like playing by your own rules? Tough shit.

@stabyoulots @jrbloom57 @RepSwalwell @repCohen1 @RepCohen @VoteMarsha @ElectBergmann HAHA!  She likes yellow. And soft.  And good, she doesn't need a pacifier anyway.  Better for her teeth.  LOL  She knows what's good.
@stabyoulots @jrbloom57 @RepSwalwell @repCohen1 @RepCohen @VoteMarsha @ElectBergmann Yep. Witch Hazel is natural and a whole hell of a lot cheaper than pricey wipes. Microfiber cloths aren't expensive either, and can be washed.
@stabyoulots @jrbloom57 @RepSwalwell @repCohen1 @RepCohen @VoteMarsha @ElectBergmann Good. Pity she didn't consult with you before the vinegar episode, but we all have those moments. Make sure she gets some Witch Hazel in the house.  Wonderfully soothing.
@stabyoulots @jrbloom57 @RepSwalwell @repCohen1 @RepCohen @VoteMarsha @ElectBergmann Witch Hazel.  Don't forget Witch Hazel, Tommi. That will help soothe some as well.

@stabyoulots @jrbloom57 @RepSwalwell @repCohen1 @RepCohen @VoteMarsha @ElectBergmann Oh, shit.  Gosh, do you know nobody who has one? Or even a spa or hot tub? Or maybe a local swim school?  High school? College? At least it wouldn't be the public park, so to speak, and somewhat limited.
@stabyoulots @jrbloom57 @RepSwalwell @repCohen1 @RepCohen @VoteMarsha @ElectBergmann That's half the battle.  Glad she doesn't get them.  My son got one that wouldn't clear up when he was about 8 months old.  Pool cleared it up.  Never had another issue.
@stabyoulots @jrbloom57 @RepSwalwell @repCohen1 @RepCohen @VoteMarsha @ElectBergmann Yep. It would likely work for that, too. I know it also works for diaper rash that refuses to clear up no matter how much ointment you apply.  If you have friends who have a pool, might be an idea to try it before end of summer.
@stabyoulots @jrbloom57 @RepSwalwell @repCohen1 @RepCohen @VoteMarsha @ElectBergmann She may outgrow that eczema.  A former neighbor's granddaughter had it until about age 2, then *poof*.  It cleared up after swimming in another neighbor's pool that summer.		They do steal your heart, no question.

@the_real_crank @PhilBredesen According to Biden, Reid and Schumer, it absolutely does. Do your homework.	Also, Kagan was nominated by Obama in May, 2010. She was confirmed in August, 2010 and Mid-terms were November, 2010.	Would you like to try again?
@the_real_crank @PhilBredesen Oh, dear.	In addition to learning the difference between simple- and super-majorities, you should probably learn the difference between a mid-term and a Presidential election year.	Obama tried to install Garland during a Presidential election year.	Try again?

@the_real_crank @PhilBredesen Which changes the fact that Democrats have obstructed on everything, including that which requires both simple- and super-majority...how, exactly?	That's in addition to attempting to delegitimize the votes of millions of U.S. citizens since November, 2016.

@Burritobrain1 Run along, troll. It's obvious you didn't bother to do your homework and are nothing more than a propaganda parrot, obediently squawking what it's told to squawk. 		Spare me your "media links". Unlike you, I don't need media translators, and can actually read the documents.
@Burritobrain1 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Run along, troll. It's obvious you didn't bother to do your homework and are nothing more than a propaganda parrot, obediently squawking what it's told to squawk. 		Spare me your "media links". Unlike you, I don't need media translators, and can actually read the documents.
Liberal stupidity.  This one claims that this	https://t.co/dbGpLOHT9N		is the document from where the below came from.		https://t.co/yYcYXuuUmz		Can't make this shit up. They truly are genuinely stupid.		#WalkAwayFromDemocrats2018 	#MAGA https://t.co/ESNFRT1KDl
@Burritobrain1 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump It's clear by you posting the above that it's YOU who didn't do their homework. How many pages in that document? What page is referenced by Swalwell and Winter?		I'll accept that as your admission that you cannot support your claim, or theirs. 		Good grief.
@Burritobrain1 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump You support your claim that a snip of a document is real by posting a snip of another unrelated document? 		Where is the ACTUAL DOCUMENT or a link to it? Stop stalling, stop avoiding and support your damn claim.  You can't be this genuinely stupid.  Or can you?
@Burritobrain1 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Your deflection and avoidance is appalling. Clearly you didn't bother to vet that which you're parroting did you?		Again, produce the document and not a snip of a screen shot. It really shouldn't be this difficult for you. You claim it's a real document. Fine. Support your claim.
Yes.  Evidence supporting your claims, Swalwell. You seem to be a little light on that, just as you're light on any actual work done on behalf of #CA15. Or, was renaming one post office during your term the extent of your abilities?	Choose more wisely, #CA15. You look like fools. https://t.co/HWo2kslMZu
@Burritobrain1 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump LMAO!  Back to "because they said so"?		Poor propaganda parrot. All they have to do is tell you what to think and believe, and you do it. Thankfully, actual evidence is required in the US, not just screen shots of an unnamed document. I could've typed that on my computer.		Idiot.
LMAO! https://t.co/4Rd1zvThQX
@Burritobrain1 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump So, no documents other than "Tom Winter says"? No audio? No actual texts or emails? Nothing? 		Did you miss the part about "because Swalwell says so" not being evidence? Same goes for him. Produce the documents, texts, emails, audio, etc.
@kwilli1046 There's no such campaign on GoFundMe.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump So where's the evidence?	"Because Swalwell says so" is evidence only of his stupidity, not evidence of an actual crime.

Her name was Mollie Tibbetts, @Dr_CMGreer, and she's much more than "a girl in Iowa". She's a young woman who, after a days-long search, was found heinously murdered by someone who shouldn't have been in this country. She had a family, friends, and dreams. Those ARE the facts. https://t.co/TtrzyEZeOR
@SusansFineArt @Breaking911 @ReaganBattalion Name the other girls in Iowa who are in the news and being talked about by the media.	I can think of only one.  Mollie Tibbetts; specifically, her murder, and this one's implication was crystal clear to anyone paying attention TO the news.
