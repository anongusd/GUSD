@MichaelCohen212 Friedman described Cohen to TPM in a February interview as a close friend and business partner, noting that he‚Äôs managed medallions for Cohen and his wife, Laura, for more than 16 years. He also said that he often had dinner with the couple.
@MichaelCohen212 Cohen told TPM in an email that the taxes are collected from drivers by the management company that handles the medallions. Cohen said his medallions are managed by Gene ‚ÄúThe Taxi King‚Äù Freidman, a New York City taxi kingpin who was recently hit with a slew of lawsuits.
@MichaelCohen212 Cohen‚Äôs father-in-law, Fima Shusterman, has been in the taxi business for decades, and was charged in the early 1990s with knowingly conspiring to defraud the IRS as part of a money laundering and tax fraud scheme.
@MichaelCohen212 Today, about half of Cohen‚Äôs medallions are managed by a company run by Freidman, who was charged in 2017 with stealing $5 million that should have been paid to New York state, and who has also been charged with threatening to kill a former business partner‚Äôs family.
