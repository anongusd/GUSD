Oh God have mercy on your Church or come and take us out. Please. I can't even imagine what the world will look like when your Infilling Holy Soirit takes us Home. The world is wicked, just as in the Days of Noah. The world lost, BIG TIME!!! https://t.co/8E4Vl25zc0
@SwaggyBGood If it's true there's needs to be a focus on replacing her. This is crazy. There needs to be an Ammendment about this sort of thing when life time positions are on hold even if a persois in a coma and /or on their death bed. Please pray for Charlie Kirk. Malpractice at it's worst.
@seanhannity Sean Charlie Kirk is lying on a bench outside of the emergency at Cedar Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, CA. His back is out and he may have a blood clot but they say they don't have a bed for him and sent him to lie on the bench outside. https://t.co/vkvyRA9OV9
@seanhannity Please read this &amp; get Charlie Kirk help. We R all in bed &amp; they R hours behind us in CA. When I told the person in the emergency room that was looking at the picture on Twitter. He got rude &amp; hung up on me. (310) 423-2700 Cedar Sinai Hospital. Los AngelesPic below. https://t.co/5ISnwntRMa
@coalburggirl Thank you. I am so praying for him. You are right. Blood clots kill. This is one of the most caring young man I have ever witnessed. We follow him a lot. He really loves this country.
@artislifeisart @coalburggirl @realDonaldTrump You really need spiritual help.
Told the hospital that I was looking at the picture of Charlie, on Twitter, lying on a bench right outside the Emergency door &amp; they hung up on me. Wrist band, wheelchair, NO medical attention. It was the emergency area that I spoke to. I am praying for him.
@coalburggirl @realDonaldTrump I called them. The number is on my post. We all need to flood them with calls. Even 911. I am dumbfounded!
@charliekirk11 @BernieSanders I have no doubt that @charliekirk11 doesn't need bernies healthcare. This isn't about rights. It's about the responsibility of medical professionals living up to their oath of practice. You need help.
@realDonaldTrump Charlie Kirk lying on a bench outside of Cedar Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. Back thrown out and possible blood clot. I called the hospital and they hung up on me. Has a hospital band on his wrist. This is beyond unbelief!!!	(310) 423-2700 https://t.co/gWwYXqdcMy

@RagingGayCons Everything we have ON this Earth came FROM this Earth, even man...Day 6 of Creation. And God breathed into the man He created from the Earth a living soul. That's takes less faith to believe than a living soul being an accident since we all have a conscience.
@RagingGayCons Romans 1 tells us there is no excuse not to. All we have to do is look at nature and how everything functions. It would take a LOT of Faith to believe that Reproduction, nature, natural resources, plants, food, animals, etc was an accident.

I have been complaining about corrupt family judges for months. The #Swamp is deeper than DC. It distroys familys yet can't be heard. I have posted a detailed explaination, Hopefully some justice can be served somewhere in the God forsaken country!
We can't find another case like this in the country, especially the state of Indiana. This judge has ruined my son's life. He sees his future as hopeless. He trusts no one, especially the legal system. What a shame at only 21. Lawyers collude...trust me!!! Big $
Nothing againt the guardians, only the judge that knowingly married a ward of the court without notifying the Guardians and then the same court taking her away from him. It took 5 months for it to be annulled. Even though the marriage was acknowledged by the guardians to be legal
The judge should have notified the Guardians. Yet he married them, took the money in cash for the ceremony and wished them the best. We also have video of him having them sign the papers. We were honest with him so that we would be assured everything was legal.
They were honest and upfront about the guardianship and it is on tape that he was informed before the serimony. We have pictures and letters. The marriage liscience and order for her to be returned to them by the exact same court. This was VERY corrupt.
Why did the court return her to her guardians after three days of them living together? Why can't we sue this judge and the county clerk for negligence and emotional harm to my son.
Any lawyers out there??? A judge performed marriage for my son and his girlfriend with full knowledge that she was a ward of the court. He knew it was an elopement. So did the clerk. He had her records. They were honest with both.

@realDonaldTrump There is no evidence that O killed him. All we saw was a mummy being dropped in the ocean. The Navy Seals no longer live!
@ChuckGrassley U need to practice this by going to him privately rather than publicly. When he is asked ?'s by media he gets rebuked if he doesn't answer and rebuked if he does answer. Respect is a 2 way street. All ?'s are debates or criticism. Wallace didn't have one positive thing 2 say/ask.

@petluvers4Trump @DonnaWR8 @ROHLL5 @KimberlyMrsRR1 @Megan4MAGA @skb_sara @Solmemes1 @IsraelUSAforevr @Jamierodr10 @MissILmom @thomesinc Yes. She can make all of this happen once she is innaugarated and signs bills into law. She must have scored big time in Government! God help us.

@Harlan @4uConservatives We ARE outraged. Short of forming a militia to protect our country our hands are tied. Just listening to the whinning and no action. Court orders ignored, criminals as supervisors of elections, conviction of previous voter fraud, not in jail, controlling ballots. #ScottGrowASpine
Done. Please follow back. Let's get to Florida and do what law enforcement isn't doing. https://t.co/NGI2KXQCv5
I certainly hope this isn't what we can expect out of a Sen. Rick Scott. He better grow a spine as fast as he can. https://t.co/RkojkMwsC2
@realDonaldTrump	Jan Brewer for AG!!! O knocked down everything she did. Now it's her turn.
@RepMattGaetz THEN HAVE THE LAWYERS ARRESTESD AND GET A SEARCH WARRANT. GET OFF OF THE TV. YOU WANT IN THERE...SHOW US THAT YOU CAN. OTHERWISE...JUST BE QUIET. I AM ANGRY!
@RepMattGaetz Stop giving interviews and get a damn search warrant and knock the doors down. Stop complaining about the games they play if you can't play on the same level. DO NOT LET THIS PRESIDENT'S EXHAULTIVE WORK GO TO HELL!!!
Get a damn search warrant and knock the doors down. Stop crying!!! https://t.co/Mfqf3VTjDq
@RealSaavedra @AcherylJh Why isn't she in jail. Why are all these people complaining and not getting a warrant on her. Why is the governor of Florida not removing her from this position. We complain about her support. Where is OUR support...Doesn't seem like we have any.
@AndrewPollackFL @ScottforFlorida @AGPamBondi @realDonaldTrump It's not Brenda Snipes I have lost confidence in. I don't know her. It's law enforcement for not arresting her before she could once again as a convicted voter fraud do the same. Violates a court order and still working this?...rather than being arrested for Contempt of Court.

@RepMattGaetz Blue Counties and/or Larger Counties...Florida Law is Florida Law and those counties ARE in Florida. Arrest the law breakers. If Rick Scott won't remove this monster from her position he deserves what he gets.
@islamargaritha @RodStryker Well unorganized Law Enforcement.
@WITHDRAWN2 @RodStryker I've been pounding this for hours now. We need to stop whinning and demand Law Enforcement stop being cowards and put law breakers in jail. If, I, a normal citizen would do something illegal I wouldn't stand a chance because I belong to the #RedDeplorableCommunity

Report and demand arrest for O sending Americans to Israel to "collude" in their election. The way a former so called president goes around stalking and inciting violence against this sitting president is dispicable. He should lose his benefits. https://t.co/dW6YyUFupC
@AndrewPollackFL @ScottforFlorida I am so sorry for what your family has been through and so proud of how active you have become to stand for #LawAndOrder and fight against #Lawlessness. My sister was murdered. I admire you.
@AndrewPollackFL @ScottforFlorida COMPARE TIME vote was cast and SIGNATURE ID. Florida law requires votes to be counted 30 minutes after polls close. Also COMPARE HANDWRITING on ballots with handwriting of the criminals doing this. Demand law enforcement make arrest to anyone violating court orders. #Lawlessness
Followed all. FB PLZ. #let's #KAG2020 https://t.co/G4t21El1ro
And let me guess. They're still walking free. If I have to sit here and watch all of #POTUS45's running his ass off all over the country for this win, only for law enforcement to not do their jobs and carry out the law I will no longer be #ProudToBeAnAmerican https://t.co/yh8Ufui8Zv
We can't blame this on the Dems as long as we allow them to defy court orders and be in charge of elections after they have been convicted of #VoterFraud. It's on us. We whin and complain like that's going to stop the #Reprobates in action. #LockThemUp https://t.co/BaO0vHreFy
That's because she can. Cowards for law enforcement. #POTUS45 worked his ass off for the Senate and has no law enforcement to arrest criminals and protect his Honor. #LeeGreenwood may have to rewrite his song. The stronger we THEY BECOME THE WEAKER WE BECOME. https://t.co/W4Zv2GPs0v

@ScottforFlorida @Hasexce44 Demand that every ballot has to be compared to driver's liscience signatures. Time of vote. 30 minutes after polls close ballot is null and viod if time and signature don't match.
