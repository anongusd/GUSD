Re: online contests, crowdsourced philanthropy: @socialcitizen's recent post mentions #Chasefail, @Pepsi: http://bit.ly/6W8XyS (via @kanter)
@smashadv @thebrandbuilder - Here's Chase's FB page (wall posts gone): http://bit.ly/5LLFFN. I know the campaign'll make a great case study!
@smashadv @thebrandbuilder Yes & all abt participation. Contest virality involves ppl like us getting our friends to participate, to "vote."
@thebrandbuilder Here's @ssstrom's NYT piece: http://bit.ly/8jBf4N. Check @kanter's blog for her thoughtful #Chasefail posts this past week.
@thebrandbuilder Let me find something NYT's @ssstrom wrote about Chase's #fail, so far. You'll appreciate it. @Pepsi could learn from it.
@smashadv @thebrandbuilder -- Nope, Jim. Corporate (or corporate foundation) funds to be disbursed to nominated (& qualifying) non-profits.
@thebrandbuilder Buzz. Short lived. Exactly. Chase is getting negative re: contest transparency from some folks in non-profit circles.
@thebrandbuilder Pepsi will "award" $20MM. Chase ‚Äì w no Twitter presence that I'm aware of ‚Äì has $5MM to award to orgs nominated through FB.
@thebrandbuilder ..meaning PEP will award $ contributions totalling $20MM to non-profits thru online ‚Äúcontest‚Äù conducted via social media.
@thebrandbuilder Have you seen much info re: @Pepsi's plans? From little I've read, campaign's akin to Chase's "community giving campaign"..

@smashadv Didn't realize @shelisrael mentions you in Twitterville. For which good reason (of the many) were you featured?
Hoping @shelisrael doesn't let another 20 yrs pass before he returns to Houston. Arrived at @coffeegroundz too late tonight to catch him. :(
There are few things as inspiring as seeing people who've had spinal cord or brain injuries giving it their all in a specially designed gym.
@jbgray07 Thanks. He's been in for a while. Things have become more complicated. I still hope to help @jgoldsborough & u w/ #hallmarkmobile.

Coffee-tasting notes (http://bit.ly/YhebR) & links to good info are among the many reasons why @palafo's a pleasure to #follow.
Today's what's-in-my-fridge-to-toss-into-a-salad: a plumcot, green grapes, mixed greens, & f-f balsamic vinaigrette & croutons. Tasty combo.
Speaking of vetting, NYT reports NEA's Landesman proposes new slogan: "Art works." Wonder if had 2 be agency approved b4 announced publicly.
@willconley777 Suggest you consider Houston-founded KIPP schools (4 underserved students) as academic model. Motto: "Work hard. Be nice." :)
Reading new NEA Chairman Landesman's 1st interview (NYT): Props 4 his preference 4 grant awards based on artistic excellence, not geography.
@willconley777 &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3 @pilobolus. First saw them 20 years ago. Continue to find the company's work mesmerizing. :)
Finally looking @VisitHoustonTX's July-Aug visitors guide picked up 2 wks ago @ IAH during wait for baggage from Toronto flight. Nice issue!

@counternotions No doubt @Houstonhospital's patient relations dept would be pleased if I said I preferred a hospital stay vs going on vacay!
@Daniel4is @omewan - Said adjustable bed at home would enable me to get up without using my still-tender abs. #PileofPillowsIsNotIdeal #Lazy
@ThursdayGirl @Karen_Eden -- Presume there's a Craftmatic bed infomercial that I haven't had the pleasure of viewing, yet?!
Admission: The hospital bed's elevated upper section that amused me last week -- yep, I miss it. Adjusting mechanism would enhance home bed.
@RobertHruzek Was that in Houston? I've worked w/ CRS(S) alumni. Many talented architects & engineers worked at CRSS &/or Morris Architects.
Met dad for lunch. Introduced myself to older couple sitting at nearby table after I heard them mention CRS Architects. Small world, indeed.

Advisory (until further notice): Do NOT make Molly laugh. Laughing makes her post-op stomach hurt. [Attention: @donthorp & @lilpecan :) ]
@KayBallard @frizzle_fry @linanneblack -- Thanks! Happy to be home. Still amazed the hospital folks didn't want to keep me around longer. ;)
If we talked over the past four days & I came across as lucid to you, I really wasn't. That was the pain medication talking on my behalf. ;)
Hello, laptop, TweetDeck, & all of you in the Twitterverse. Nice to see you again. Tweeting from my phone--& from hospital--has limitations.
At home. Very grateful. :)
Striving to be a *patient* patient.
I can think of many places other than *this* bed where I'd prefer to wake up on this fine Sunday morning.  ;-)
Drat, missed #wlnh due to this inconvenient hospital stint. @wholefoodshou @gdruckman @block7wineco, when's the next #wlnh?
@daniel4is Yes, better now. :)
@daniel4is The reason I'm still awake is to be able to say hello to you in real-time. (read recent tweets to see where I am)
@wzzy Improving, but really should be sleeping. Keep thinking about your hi-tech hospital bed each time I turn on the light to adjust mine!
@joshacagan That made me laugh, which, in turn, hurts. Now need additional pain meds, thx to you. ;-)
Extending my props to my nurse who just presented me with pain medication AND cold peach slices and graham crackers. :)
@napril1023 Getting better, though it still hurts to laugh (or to sit up or get back in bed). Hope to move around a bit more later today!
@scottk75 At Texas Medical Center. Nice of you to think of coming by. Would much rather see you under 'normal' circumstances!

Kidding abt the Scotch. ALL liquids r off limits til after 1st surgery. Allowing me to *drink* h2O via sips & spitting it out. Parched!
Thx for all your kind msgs. I'm too wiped out to respond to each one. Pls know that I'm reading & appreciating them very, very much.
Will one of you call my nurse to request a single-malt Scotch for me? #cannotfindcallbell ;)

@tellingtales Sorry to hear that, Julie. I'm sure you'd rather be visiting T.O. & your family under different circumstances.
Houston friends: Westheimer / Post Oak intersection light's out. Heavy traffic. Bypass the Galleria area, if you can.
@tellingtales Had I realized you were en route to Toronto, I might have stayed there longer (left yesterday afternoon)!
Will catch up later with #followFriday and everything else. Really!

Houston friends: Tomorrow's the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston's pick-your-price membership day! http://bit.ly/9beHJ, via @heatherpray & @MFAH
@LindaEskin @rosyblue -- Thank you. I'll recharge the vibes & resend them to you. Probably early next week, unless you need them sooner. :)
@mamapigeon Same here. :-)
Rare for me to say... but I'm having to deal with too many things right now. Send your extra good vibes my way. (I promise to return them!)
Just bonded over the phone with someone who I've never met. Love it when that happens.
It's a Snow Patrol night, thx to the blips of @sharonhayes @omewan & @misternoodle ~ ‚ô´ http://blip.fm/~78qp7
@katriord Following them already. (Wish they could change the fact that 24/7 in-home care costs $10,000+/month, w no Medicare $ assistance!)
@cara19 Will Clinique's Black Honey lipcolor make an appearance on the scene? :)
@cara19 Doing well, but somewhat frazzled this wk from dealing w/ things related to my father, his care & his house. How are you & the kids?
@cara19 You've become a regular customer of the dealership's service department, haven't you? (Not a good thing.)
@katriord Will take a look at the tagged tweets. Good suggestion.

@jonesdel I've been on the phone for most of the morning & am sending this belated note of congrats re: your CEO Twitter story. Will RT it!
@womenkind Nothing tops it.
@katjaib May I apply for a full-time position in your family? http://bit.ly/oM74g  :-)
@katjaib I count myself as a member of the pro-hugging camp. You, too?
RT @mattmansfield: Hug it out, bro. http://bit.ly/xCdKx In between texts, kids serially hugging. a page 1 trend [NYT]. (via @carr2n)
@MisterNoodle I'd post #FastFollowFive, too, but I'm so tired, my brain's stopped at 20% (yep, that refers to following you)! #FastFollowOne
Treat yourself to @rickbakas' chilled watermelon soup made w/ dessert wine & honey. You'll be glad you did. http://bit.ly/JuZd8
Continued cabinet cleaning spree at my father's house tonight. Advice: As often as possible, encourage your parents to part with things. :)
. @TheCubsInHaiku / Can't think who told me of name / @itsjenjen, 'twas you?  [#haiku #cubs #scoreoneforcreativity]
@BuzzEdition I applaud such creative use of social media instruments(!). *standing ovation* :)
Love the @collective_soul contest, @BuzzEdition (& congrats on the new addition to your family)!
RT @webaddict: RT @collective_soul: Check out the contest we are launching http://bit.ly/twittercelebrity - win signed guitar, tix etc
@texaseducation I should've thought of that -- I'm a former Torontonian! On another note: Good music selection. :)
@bcuban Good! What's the topic they've invited you to talk about?
Three questions to help align your brand. http://is.gd/FXxO (via @KurtKennedy)
@bcuban Re: Commonwealth Club of SF: Have you looked at the list of board members' names - many corporate & community leaders whom you know?
@texaseducation Because they're from the UK, Australia, or NZ. Their spelling there is different from ours. (note: they're, their, & there!)
@cincinnatiopera @AudienceDevSpec -- Thx for the RT!
RT @atlantasymphony: RT @LaceyH: This is great - Bach meets bongos, congas, saxophones & gourds: http://bit.ly/18xS1w
Trying to make it home early enough to catch @peterhimmelman‚Äôs @furiousworld @Ustream livecast at 9:00 p.m. CST. Last saw it pre-SxSW.
@atlantasymphony @queens_hall @spokanesymphony @twORCHESTRAS -- Thanks for the RTs!
Late lunch @ Orig. Napoli Flying Pizza on Westheimer. Five ppl sitting @ table next to us consumed copious amount of wine. :)
@atlantasymphony Thx! BTW, did you catch this arts education story from LATimes: http://bit.ly/artsed (via @MarilynM)
@amaopera @kalebjake -- So, the two of you are related? :) (thx for RT!)

@kalebjake Thx for the Coke info. Someone posted a pic of the can designs last wk; your link's the first I've seen of info directly from KO.
@MisterNoodle Blip.fm is an, ahem, instrumental part of what makes you, you. ‚ô´‚ô™
RT @entreprediva: It is nice to be important but it is much more important to be nice. -Unknown #quote
@julianna01 @Cbusgivesback -- Very nice of you to RT the NYT niceness piece. :-))) Thx!
@McMedia Try rolling your clothes, instead of folding them. Helps to compact the items & keep them from wrinkling (too much!).
@ezra_brooks Useful, yes, esp. for information sharing (e.g., cheese info!); overused, very possible (& begs the Q: What to keep private?).
@amvandenhurk Ditto!

@sethsimonds Or your 'do could be enhanced further with the addition of a tiara. (@blellow, nice job!)
@janetlyon Looking forward to meeting you, too. Yes, Hermann Park is a great place in which to spend time -- doing things, or doing nothing!
@kimberlykeith Thanks for the RT!
@MarilynM It's something that's good to read when you have some quiet time (& when you're fully awake!).
'Favorited' yesterday & reading today: @HiroBoga's beautiful post: Swimming in the Sea of Story: http://bit.ly/hVYTp (via @victoriashmoria)
Sharing: Excellent site, via @milesobrien, for tracking Atlantis: http://bit.ly/rEkzB (projected landing in &lt; 20 min)
@allenweiss Agreed, + BW's @shirleybrady & @JohnAByrne are among my fav people to follow (& whose tweets often attract my attention!). :)
@toddbrink You're welcome. Glad to see you've got the smoker fired up & doing its job. Enjoy the day!
@SteveLeveen It's a great saying to set in stone -- & something I hope we don't see set *on* a stone for you for a very, very long time. :)
I used to associate Jim Collins w "Good to Great." From seeing @JohnAByrne's tweets from the past few wks, I now associate JC w BusinessWeek
Fans of management guru Jim Collins: You'll enjoy reading about his books, modi operandi, processes: http://bit.ly/GNKYE, via @TimOBrienNYT
@SteveLeveen I'm sure you'll agree: Life's too short for common paper clips.
Happy anniversary, @toddbrink & @jennbrink!
@SteveLeveen I'm a fan of the @levenger co. & products (& may have contributed to how quickly nautilus clips sold out several yrs ago). :-)
Hitting the road & happy to be a passenger so I can read. Today's book pick is @suzywelch's 10-10-10.
@RickBakas Dear applicant 471, when do we learn of your selection as finalist for Murphy-Goode's #areallygoodejob? http://bit.ly/kAR2y :)
@kenwheaton Whew, thank goodness you made it. And did so before the sun set. A good Wheaton weekend involves BBQ -- any good Q joints there?
@TWalk I forgot about Bosca: http://www.boscaonline.com/. I carried a Bosca wallet for yrs; it aged well.
Give a listen to @Collective_Soul's Shine (good theme for the day)! [version w/ @atlantasymphony youth orchestra] ‚ô´ http://blip.fm/~6w0cm
@DebCE Re The Woodlands, @prosperitygal talked about the idea of holding a north Houston tweetup. The two of you may want to combine forces.
@TWalk For good leather goods, have you tried Coach or @levenger? Or @louisvuitton_us products? :)
@palafo @martindave @cindymilleratl @CASUDI -- Thx for the RTs! (I'm a fan of Danny Meyer's. Did you read his "Setting the Table" book?)

@MrsRoadshow Something similar happened several wks ago via Chicagoan @ginidietrich & her #followFriday recos of Houstonians @CesLSU @DebCE!
@squishymatter You've exceeded already my level of technical flash know-how.
Just realized I have Brooklyn friend @TraderAlamo & his #followFriday recs to thank for intro. to fellow Houstonian @janetlyon. Love that!
