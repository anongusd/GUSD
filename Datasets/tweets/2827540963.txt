@NUWildcats2003 @dwallbank I didn‚Äôt know about these! Thx
@bobacola Yes, I recently changed the battery on my iPhone.. but this happened last time I upgraded my iOS too.. battery dies in half the time
@dwallbank I don‚Äôt care about photo quality that much but I would really like a big screen phone, practical for work and long long battery life.. how‚Äôs Google Pixel on all these? (Also, does the terminal work well on it?)
@theIvanLoh I was really considering a Samsung, especially with their huge screens these days. I work A LOT on my phone and my eyes hurt all the time.
Do others get battery life sucked out of iPhone after updating iOS? My phone is dying in half the time after upgrading.. this happened last time I upgraded too. I think I‚Äôm done with Apple now.. any suggestions on brands?
