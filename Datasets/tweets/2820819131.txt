Columbans urge the administration to reverse this decision and instead follow the lead of the border communities who have been welcoming and supporting those arriving at the border seeking refuge.
@DHSgov's new measure effectively denies asylum by postponing it, and thus is a violation of international norms and laws. It's the same thing @CBP is doing every day, all along the US/MX border: rejecting the right to ask for asylum by postponing its exercise indefinitely.
The very motivation for asking for asylum is based on the need for self-preservation. Forcing people to wait in Mexico for an undetermined amount of time in dangerous environments fundamentally ignores this need for safety.

As we work on the ground in communities often most impacted by trade and investment agreements like NAFTA, Columbans urge all Members of Congress to consider what such agreements would look like if negotiated from the perspective of the most vulnerable, including the environment.
A  year ago, 16 faith-based organizations outlined our principles by which we would evaluate any renegotiated NAFTA. The agreement signed today must be remedied in key ways in order to live up to those principles. 		Read our principles here: https://t.co/sbP3uKH1NL

Columbans call on all policymakers to make tangible "the heart of God" by supporting just and humane immigration policies. #MigrantCaravan #Immigrants #refugee #asylum
As @Pontifex said when he closed the Year of Mercy, “In God’s heart there are no enemies. God only has sons and daughters. We are the ones to raise walls, build barriers, and label people.”
Columbans consider it a blessing to accompany and support border communities and those arriving at the southern border. We believe our federal policy should reflect the same welcome and respect that border communities themselves show.
Today’s announcement from the administration outlining attempts to restrict access to protection for migrants and further militarize the southern border stands in direct opposition to this sacred obligation.  #asylum #MigrantCaravan
As a Society that serves marginalized communities in countries plagued by poverty and conflict, we see how these conditions drive people to migrate. As people of faith, God calls us to serve the needs of migrants and refugees everywhere and address the root causes of migration.

The administration created this disaster; Congress has the power to fix it.
We need permanent protections for immigrant youth in addition to reductions in funding for detention, deportation, and border militarization- all of which contribute to the uncertainty and trauma facing immigrant communities, including DACA recipients.
This time last year, we called on Congress to fill the gap by immediately passing legislation to codify DACA protections into law. Unfortunately, a year later, our call is the same.
Today marks a year since the administration announced the repeal of the DACA program. Today also marks a year of uncertainty, lost opportunity, and trauma for DACA recipients and their families because of the administration’s actions.

Farm workers along the border get paid in small plastic chips. When they fill a bucket of, say, chili peppers, they get one chip. At the end of the day, they cash them all in for their wages. Each chip is worth 77 cents. Sometimes a worker can make less than $15 a day. #border https://t.co/WOmOZNiaFp

We believe our federal policy should reflect the same welcome and respect that border communities themselves show, and abstain from this unethical treatment of human beings, made in the image of our Creator.
This will only increase the pain of the separation of families, with violent effects on children as developing human beings. As #Catholics and members of border communities, we consider it a blessing and an opportunity to serve and support those coming to the US seeking safety.
It is immoral to make families suffer this kind of traumatic separation of children from their parents, especially in order to obtain some imagined purpose that is thought to justify the measure--that is, to send a message of deterrence to others.

It creates significant economic profits for the powerful few but only minimal benefits for the communities where resources are found. 	#JustLent2018 #Lent https://t.co/j1FNDB9Bl8

Jesus came so that we might have life, and have it more abundantly (John 10: 10). As his followers, @SenSasse, Columbans want a world where all God’s children have exactly that. We urge you to uphold His teaching by supporting robust &amp; immediate protections for #Dreamers.

Politics, according to the social doctrine of the Church, is one of the highest forms of charity, because it serves the common good. I cannot wash my hands, eh? We all have to give something! @Pontifex #SOTU #StateofOurUnion
In a word, if we want security, let us give security; if we want life, let us give life; if we want opportunities, let us provide opportunities. The yardstick we use for others will be the yardstick which time will use for us. #StateofOurUnion #SOTU  @Pontifex
Let us treat others with the same passion and compassion with which we want to be treated. Let us seek for others the same possibilities which we seek for ourselves. Let us help others to grow, as we would like to be helped ourselves. #StateofOurUnion #SOTU @Pontifex
when it strives for justice and the cause of the oppressed, as Dorothy Day did by her tireless work, the fruit of a faith which becomes dialogue and sows peace in the contemplative style of Thomas Merton." @Pontifex #SOTU
"A nation can be considered great when it defends liberty as Lincoln did, when it fosters a culture which enables people to “dream” of full rights for all their brothers and sisters, as Martin Luther King sought to do; @Pontifex #SOTU
However, if you fulfill the royal law according to the scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing well. #StateofOurUnion (James 2: 8)
Did not God choose those who are poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom that he promised to those who love him? But you dishonored the poor person. Are not the rich oppressing you? And do they themselves not haul you off to court? #SOTU  (James 2: 5-6)
Be doers of the word and not hearers only, deluding yourselves. Religion that is pure and undefiled before God and the Father is this: to care for orphans and widows in their affliction and to keep oneself unstained by the world. #SOTU
Faced with a culture of violence, the expansion of a military presence around the world, and a growing arms industry, we must work to cultivate a culture of peace and nonviolence. #SOTU2018

@EPA wants to repeal a plan to reduce carbon pollution. But before they can, they are legally required to accept public feedback on their decision. Tell EPA we want a cleaner, healthier America. #ProtectCPP
The poor are not a problem. They are a resource from which to draw as we strive to accept and practice in our lives the essence of the Gospel.		https://t.co/5CzDUUXP6q 		#blessed #poor #Pope #justice #catholic #Jesus #God #poor #reflect #Columban
@EPA We can take care of our workers, our vulnerable, &amp; our environment all at once. What we can no longer afford to do is ignore the realities before us and place profits over people, the interest of a few over the good of everyone. #ProtectCPP
Columbans across the globe witness the horrible devastation carbon pollution wreaks on the earth &amp; the vulnerable. This administration continues to demonstrate that they dont appreciate the extent to which our fossil fuel economy is tearing apart the web of life. #ProtectCPP
Friendship with the poor can draw forth from us a desire &amp; commitment to build bridges, not walls; to show mercy &amp; work for justice; to find the courage to accept the risks that the Gospel requires. 		https://t.co/5CzDUUXP6q 		#blessed #poor #pray #Columban #love #faith #hope
Let us welcome the poor as honored guests at our table; they can be teachers who help us live the faith more consistently. 		https://t.co/5CzDUUXP6q 		 #blessed #poor #Pope #justice #catholic #Jesus #God #poor  #reflect #Columban
If there are poor people where we live who seek protection and assistance, let us draw close to them: it will be a favorable moment to encounter the God we seek. 		https://t.co/5CzDUUXP6q		#blessed #poor #Pope #justice #catholic #Jesus #God #poor #reflect #Columban

Very few of the poor who cross our borders are security risks, and most who do cross are fleeing from violence, extreme poverty and climate disasters.		https://t.co/5CzDUUXP6q 		#blessed #poor #Pope #justice #immigrant #Dreamer
The border is a microcosm of “the joys &amp; hopes, the anxieties &amp; the afflictions” that immigrants experience on both sides of the border, a place where “the cry of the earth” and “the cry of the poor” are especially present		https://t.co/5CzDUUXP6q 		#blessed #poor #Pope #justice
Those who are hungry and sick, the stranger and the prisoner, the poor and the abandoned, the suffering and those who are cast aside, that is where we encounter Jesus. What response will we make in return?		https://t.co/5CzDUUXP6q		#blessed #poor #Pope #justice
In a nation of so much abundance, we are reminded of the many in our midst who are poor, homeless on the streets or in prison, abandoned in nursing homes or separated from their families, living in fear of being deported.		https://t.co/5CzDUUXP6q 		#blessed #poor #Pope #justice
