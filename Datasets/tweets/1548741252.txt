According to prosecutors, ‚ÄúAMI admitted that it made the $150,000 payment in concert with a candidate‚Äôs presidential campaign, and in order to ensure that the woman did not publicize damaging allegations about the candidate before the 2016 presidential election.‚Äù
On the same day, prosecutors announced that they had reached a deal with National Enquirer publisher American Media, which had made one of the payments in a so-called ‚Äúcatch and kill‚Äù deal to buy the woman‚Äôs story and not publish it.
Even Andrew McCarthy, Mariotti‚Äôs fellow former prosecutor and a Republican Trump defender, ‚Äúconcluded that Trump is likely to be indicted.‚Äù
‚ÄúNo competent lawyer would tell a client who was publicly implicated in a crime by federal prosecutors that the client was not at very serious risk of being indicted,‚Äù Mariotti noted.
Nevertheless, the ex-prosecutor said the statement was significant ‚Äî and that ‚Äúno one in that courtroom, including the judge, disagreed that Trump directed Cohen to commit crimes.‚Äù
The admission was a ‚Äúformality,‚Äù Mariotti argued, noting that it‚Äôs confirmation of what prosecutors concluded the week prior in Cohen‚Äôs probation hearing.
Former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti wrote in a Politico editorial that Federal Judge William H. Pauley II, Cohen‚Äôs sentencing judge, ‚Äúsaid in open court that Trump had directed his then-lawyer to commit a federal felony.‚Äù
Juli√°n Castro, the former housing secretary in the Obama administration and the former mayor of San Antonio, announced on Wednesday that he was forming a presidential exploratory committee, the first potential step toward a bid for the White House in 2020.
