@rachelheldevans Promises like; the rise of household income, decline of poverty, judiciary appointments, economic growth, Jerusalem, only US president meeting with N.Korea leader, tax cuts are being kept.
@Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump Economic growth, judiciary appointments, rise of household income and rate of poverty decline, first US President to meet with N. Korea leader, Jerusalem... I would think many US citizens would like him. Please do not speak on my behalf.
@rachelheldevans I would think US presidents who met with dictators/leaders do not agree with how they live and treat their country, but they should still meet with them. President Trump seems to be pro-life, I don't see any "supposedly" reasoning in that statement.
@Alyssa_Milano Since 1776 there have been protests on July 4th. To declare American colonies independence from Great Britain is why The Declaration of Independence was written. Protesters on July 4th is nothing new, and expected by all presidents I'm sure. I'll show thanks.
