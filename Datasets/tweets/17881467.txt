Asked whether being unmarried should factor into electability, Booker says. ‚ÄúIf Donald Trump can get elected with the personal life that he has? Then anybody can.‚Äù But adds, laughing: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs two more years. Give me some time.‚Äù
And for the first time (as far as I know), Booker addressed his current relationship status, confirming he has a girlfriend. ‚ÄúBefore I declared for president, I‚Äôve been dating somebody really special. (Would she make a nice first lady?) ‚ÄúYes she would.‚Äù
Booker addresses Northam again: ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt disrespect entire swaths of this country and think that you deserve to lead.‚Äù
Responding to Trump saying he doesn‚Äôt have a chance in 2020, Booker says: ‚ÄúThere is not a person who's listening to my voice right now who has not been underestimated, put down, doubted, and overcome anyway. And so this is what Donald Trump is. He doubts, he demeans, he degrades‚Äù

Booker has said recently that he plans to make an announcement ‚Äúsoon‚Äù re 2020. This shows how close they are.
It‚Äôs a really interesting team. Frosolone led Iowa Dems‚Äô statehouse campaigns in 2018, knows the state at a granular level. O‚ÄôHern brings the valuable caucus experience. Hager spent the last cycle focusing on turning out young voters. Seger is outgoing comms director for IA Dems
Cory Booker has identified an initial slate of Iowa hires pending a public announcement about his 2020 plans. Michael Frosolone, Joe O‚ÄôHern, Haley Hager and Tess Seger all expected to join the Booker team, per source. (Des Moines Reg first reported on Hager/Seger.)

On the way to Columbia SC, Bernie was on my flight. On the way home, Cory Booker is on board. 		(Man across the aisle from him: ‚ÄúAre you Cory Booker?‚Äù Followed by an excited selfie.)
Booker added: "I think we need leaders that understand that we have to...lead with love. So, yesterday I had the day with John Lewis and Jimmy Carter‚Ä¶ two moral giants in America who represent decency and really resonate to me what I want my message to be in leadership."
I thought this was really interesting and asked Booker, after he met with Jimmy Carter this weekend, whether he sees similarities between 1976 and 2020.  He said: "I think that this is a moment in America that calls for moral voices." Which I think is a yes? https://t.co/CzPVIMTVFF
Booker also talked about meeting with President Carter over the weekend, saying it ‚Äúblew me away that (he) would encourage me to run for president.‚Äù 		‚ÄúI‚Äôm not that far from making a decision myself,‚Äù Booker added.
Asked what he thinks of Kamala Harris announcing her candidacy on MLK Day, Cory Booker was uncharacteristically succinct: ‚ÄúKamala is a dear friend of mine, and I wish her well.‚Äù
We asked Rep. Jim Clyburn what he thinks of Kamala Harris announcing her candidacy on MLK Day. ‚ÄúWell, I think that‚Äôs a pretty good symbol,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut everybody will wait to see exactly how the substance will square with the symbolism.‚Äù
Cory Booker did not mention Trump in his remarks at SC MLK Event. Bernie Sanders taking a different tack - saying Trump is ‚Äúa racist.‚Äù

Booker: ‚ÄúThe kind of charges that many people are talking about hold serious consequences for anybody, whether you're president of the United States or a citizen. ...No one is above the law. Donald Trump is not above the law.‚Äù
Cory Booker responding to BuzzFeed report said it ‚Äúunderlines even further why the Mueller investigation needs to continue,‚Äù but stopped short of saying the revelations would be grounds for impeachment if true.
Maybe not intentional, but Cory Booker just struck a contrast with Beto‚Äôs WaPo interview. After running through some problems facing the country, Booker says, ‚ÄúThe question isn‚Äôt talking about these problems ... the question is, what are we going to do about it?‚Äù
Richmond: ‚ÄúCory has to make some really big decisions over the next couple of weeks ...I want you to give Cory the encouragement to make that decision.‚Äù

The Missouri Secretary of State's office is expecting record turnout tonight, we're told. 		This is making some Democrats nervous. High turnout in the cities/suburbs is one thing. But in a red state like MO, high turnout across the board suggests robust GOP energy too.

Reminder as we watch #MOSen today: although MO was solid R in the past two presidentials, it‚Äôs still complicated. Roy Blunt held on by &lt;3 in 2016. Many voters here are too ornery to be straight partisans and demand a lot of their candidates. 		So...it‚Äôll probably be close.
Polls are now OPEN in Missouri. Happy Election Day, everyone.

We‚Äôve heard this from Flake before - he hasn‚Äôt been shy about taking on the president. But his anti-Trump message takes on new meaning in New Hampshire, as does his openness to mounting such a challenge.

Not on the agenda: rethinking GOP's anti-Pelosi, pro-tax reform messaging strategy. Republicans still believe it can work, even though it didn't give Saccone an edge. https://t.co/1IR5nE9eim

The group spent $millions in the primary for Luther Strange and against Moore, but left open the possibility of supporting Moore vs. Doug Jones if the race was close. Now they say: not happening.
