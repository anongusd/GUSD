Here is our full interview with Sam Nunberg about his testimony with the Mueller grand jury. https://t.co/Ncp62iFWpL via @msnbc
Q: Do you regret your cable blitz on Monday?		Sam Nunberg: "Absolutely not! Monday was fun."
Q: Does Robert Mueller have anything regarding Trump and Russia?		Sam Nunberg: "I would hope not. And I don't think the President would do something like that. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm not."
I have no criminal liability "to the best of my knowledge" and "to what they have told me."		- Sam Nunberg
"Of course they're looking into whether there was coordination with the emails... they are looking into that."		- Sam Nunberg
Sam Nunberg tells me he did not refuse to answer any questions during the Mueller grand jury appearance.
"If they believe they have something against the president, it better be within the scope of that investigation's mandate... with collusion with the Russians, which I don't believe [Trump] did."		- Sam Nunberg
"The President has to do [a Mueller] interview I would say. I would highly suggest that he does."		- Sam Nunberg
First question for Sam Nunberg: "Where you fit into President Trump's orbit? When and how long did you work for his campaign?" https://t.co/UaP3HWTOyB
"I was never in any personal legal jeopardy."		- Sam Nunberg to me
"[Trump] really did give me a lot of chances and I could have been a better employee."		- Sam Nunberg tells me
"Roger Stone and I had a critical role in helping President Trump, who's always his own strategist, develop a script that would really help him... be gold in [his] political brand."		- Sam Nunberg to me on @MSNBC
I knew [Trump] was going to run at about mid 2014		- Sam Nunberg to me
