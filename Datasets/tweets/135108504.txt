It was an honor testifying before the @PASenateGOP Policy Committee, As Chairman of @CL4Ed, I believe the decision in the Janus case can mark a pivotal turning point in advancing fundamental values in education and state leaders should look to the work being done in Pennsylvania.
Let’s work together to find ways to reward teachers – just like the most effective and productive employees are awarded in every other profession.
"To realize the promise of #Janus, first, we owe it to teachers to provide them professional support disassociated from any political agenda, including access to insurance, a fair decision-making processes, and reliable compensation information."
"I think of the Janus decision in terms of the three P’s, which are the premise, the prohibition, and the promise. Our focus at @CL4Ed is the promise – the opportunity to reform antiquated education dogma."
We are live in Pennsylvania to discuss the positive impact Janus vs. AFSCME will have in the classroom. Click here to watch: https://t.co/5dO5GRSP1b
At 11AM, I will be testifying in front of the @PASenateGOP Policy Committee on the positive long-term impact the landmark #Janus decision could have on schools and developing a greater culture of teacher professionalism. Watch the event live here: https://t.co/5dO5GRSP1b

A smart friend asked if there was anyone in the loop at FBI or Justice who did not or would not sign the warrant request. One would hope so.
So essentially the FBI opened a formal investigation (&amp; wiretapped US citizens) based prominently on political opposition research funded by the DNC &amp; HC campaign. If you can’t see what’s wrong with that, no matter what side of political spectrum, then you’ve lost all objectivity

Jose said his son asked him if his name was really Jose Rodriguez when he found out he was CIA. HA!
Rodriguez: We have authority in government no-one else has. Comes in useful when terrorists kill 3,000 people.
Rodriguez: We got info from interrogations that led us to "the courier" - the one guy who knew where Bin Laden was
Rodriguez: "Khalid Sheik Mohammed was tough as they come. Sleep deprivation weakened him to the point that he threw in the towel."
Rodriguez: "I sleep very well at night. Enhanced interrogation saved American lives. Its actually a pretty wimpy program if you ask me."
Rodriguez: We suffered tremendously from reporters who ignored our requests to not print certain things that compromised nat'l security.
Rodriguez: "I have no apologies whatsoever. We kept America safe."
I am very excited for our next guest, Mr. Jose Rodriguez. A true patriot.
@RichLowry: Many liberals think women still live in a "Mad Men" world. In reality, job and edu prospects for women have never been better.
By the way, the source of that info is a study conducted by the center-left Brookings Institute. Pretty good odds I think.
If you graduate high school, find a job, and don't have children before age 21 and married, you'll have a 75% chance of being middle class.

Scott Walker's courageous reforms in Wisconsin are working, reports @McCormackJohn http://t.co/cgzJnhsx
Don't miss our show tomorrow. @DennisPrager with his new book. GOP Rep. @RepTomPrice on Obamacare. Indiana's @Tony_Bennett on education.
I am more optimistic about #education reform right now than I ever have been in my entire career. Lots of good work being done out there.
The main job of the public #school is to teach children numeracy and literacy.
We don't agree on everything, but I have a great deal of respect for @joelieberman. A man of faith who has worked to keep America safe.
Fun talking with caller Annie from Colorado. Her resistance to coercive green agenda in public schools was poignant and humorous.
The Fast and Furious scandal is one of the core issues that indicates the Obama Administration's incompetence. We shouldn't just let it go.
@katiepavlich on MIA right now talking about the Obama Administration's Fast and the Furious cover-up
Good show lined up. 6:30 @katiepavlich on F & F scandal. 7:30 Luis Moreno. 8:05 Sen. @joelieberman. Only on Morning in America!
America has always demonstrated a special capacity for self-renewal. Civil War, WWII, 70s were hard but we bounced back. Resiliency is in us
RT @JimPethokoukis: Reagan: "No weapon in the arsenals of the world is so formidable as the will and moral courage of free men and women."
@WDE236 Thanks!
One of the reasons I like Paul Ryan's plan is because the gradual reforms appeal to young and old alike. #GOP #paulryan

Lots of heartfelt tributes to Chuck Colson pouring in from my listeners. Really honored to have such an audience.
Last Easter was the first in 36 years that Chuck #Colson was not ministering to those in prison.
Robbie George: #Colson and Neuhaus did a lot to promote cooperation between Protestants and Catholics and clear away misunderstandings
One of the great moral thinkers of our time, Professor Robert George, coming on at 8:05 to talk #Colson and other topics.
@ByronYork is convinced #Obama is in trouble on the #Keystone Pipeline. 69 House #Democrats have broke with him on this issue.
One of the sharpest political reporters on the beat, @ByronYork, is coming on to talk #2012 and all things politics. #TCOT #GOP
Higher education always talks about diversity, but loves to isolate conservatives and won't acknowledge their own liberalism.
Also, visit http://t.co/LYAx7Crm to sign up for daily e-mails from my book APA.  Smart, quick dose of American history each morning.
Loved hearing from our caller Jerry from Philadelphia. Marine turned Catholic schoolteacher in urban Philly. The kind of man we need.
#Colson knew what Aristotle did - #character comes from habits you learn in the #family structure.
Today is Roy Orbison's birthday as well. One of the great rock and roll voices of all time. We'll be hearing some of his music, too.
Also looking forward to speaking Friday night at UPenn with @AnnCoulter and @hughhewitt. Check out http://t.co/VUlkDaD7 for details and tix.
@dansenor Thanks Dan!

You can hear the frustration and anger in Sen. McCain's voice over this outrageous bill. He's not backing down.
McCain, If this President is serious about earmarks, he will veto or threaten to veto this bill.

McCain, "Omnibus is big spenders last stand, and is an outrage to voters across America.. outrage and insult to American people" #tcot

GWB, Iran is threat to peace in Middle East... we tried to slow down clock for nuke and speed up clock for regime change
GWB, "I make the case that TARP saved the country from collapse...and it's been repaid."
Bush, Look at deficit and debt to GDP under my presidency. The facts are what they are.
GWB, Look to South Korea as an example of the benefits of democracy in a country.
GWB, "We hope for best, but Iraq situation isn't surprising that it takes awhile for democracy to take root"
GWB, "History will justify many of Blair's decision... He stood his ground under fire."
GWB, Blair is a stand-up guy, you learn character of person in times of stress... Tony never compromised his principles
GWB, I've walked off the national stage, and it doesn't benefit the nation to be criticizing the next president
to quote Washington, "if he leaves of his own, he's the greatest man in the world," Bush has done that with dignity
