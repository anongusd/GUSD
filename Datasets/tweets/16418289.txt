If it works he will enjoy another four years, if not, he will be a one term president.
The President had to tackle Social Security and Medicare. Raise taxes and/or cut the rates of increase spending.
If it works, employment will go up. The Fed has its job to balance interest rates or battle inflation.
I am afraid. The stimulus bill will either drive up inflation or drive up interest rates which means more unemployment.
Will the Cal legislators damn us by raising taxes ?
