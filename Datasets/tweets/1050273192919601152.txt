If the @JaneMayerNYer report is accurate, then all it shows is that our government has been broken and corrupted for decades and #Trump did nothing different from what his predecessors did. Need I remind you G.W. Bush spied on millions of Americans &amp; Obama misused the #IRS?
The last time America was #normal was during the #JFK years (perhaps not civil rights-wise, but in most other ways). Can we keep the positive gains for #CivilRights and return to #middleclass America please? I'm so tired of politics today.
For such a technological person, you sure were quick to refuse funding for expanded #nuclear power plants; nuclear #fusion research; and #carbon #capture tech. It's not that you're a #hypocrite. It's that you're utterly #wrong abt the 1 issue you claim to specialize in. https://t.co/0VtnQERMFK

Now that #HanoiSummit is over, the US will focus on #Venezuela. We should be focusing on #IndiaPakTension though. THEY‚ÄôVE GOT NUKES!!!
One thing, though: @realDonaldTrump, #KimJongUn knew about #Warmbier‚Äôs despicable treatment and sent him back to us brain dead to send Washington a message. We must always be willing to avoid war, but #NeverForget about the nature of truly evil men.
@morningmika is ‚Äúuncomfortable‚Äù whenever a woman apologizes. Imagine if @realDonaldTrump said he was uncomfortable when a man apologizes. It‚Äôd be the next great media scandal. The media, man, you can‚Äôt make this stuff up! üòÇüòÇ@Morning_Joe

@RMartinWriting @TyphonJRT @washingtonpost Don‚Äôt obfuscate. The issue is about choice vis-a-vis private entities choosing who they wish to do business with. My original point stands. If a biz can deny service b/c they don‚Äôt like a client‚Äôs politics, then they can deny services for other client choices.
Just remember @realDonaldTrump had originally decreed that #SpaceForce would be an #independent branch. Yet, the #Pentagon fought so hard against him that it is now a part of the #AirForce, meaning it will be smaller and not as well funded as it should be. #DeepState
@RMartinWriting @washingtonpost I‚Äôm really not. My original point is the point that I continue driving at: IT. IS. ABOUT. CHOICE. https://t.co/4yUYZSa4Ub
@RMartinWriting @washingtonpost The point is that it‚Äôs about private choice. It‚Äôs also a freedom of expression issue. So, if you don‚Äôt like private businesses denying service to gay people, don‚Äôt support private businesses denying people service based on their political preferences.
@Gennaerophone Compare the treatment of those #CovingtonKids by the #Left and the disgusting #FakeHateCrime perpetrated by @JussieSmollett. There IS a gross double standard and the only #victim here is the #truth.
@Gennaerophone So it‚Äôs not about choosing who you love, and people on the #Right get to be treated by a legal double-standard, according to you? Talk about prejudice.
Must read from @dkahanerules https://t.co/ub3EpvIE8K
@RMartinWriting @washingtonpost I thought the whole argument from the LGBTQ lobby was that it‚Äôs an individual‚Äôs ‚Äúchoice‚Äù to love who they want. Regardless, this is a 1A issue. The issues are comparable to each other, in the eyes of the law. It‚Äôs about choice and the rights of private entities.

@MegaUltraMoon @TheAndrewJay @UrbanAchievr @AOC @GOP I was not. No retribution was implied. It was a simple twofer: we cut a key @DNC talking point out of the national discourse (thereby moving the country beyond the #Boomer BS) and we can actually pay a little bit of the debt down in the process (or shore up #SocialSecurity).
@TheAndrewJay @UrbanAchievr I'm no more #liberal than #SteveBannon. All I'm doing is updating his proposal from 2017. A 15-30% increase in top marginal tax rates is a) a helluva lot better than the 70% level that @AOC wants and, by coming to the table, it allows the @GOP to prevent worse #hikes elsewhere.
I'm so #tired of us #Republicans being called the "party of the #rich." In fact, the @DNC is. To dispel these #false notions, @realDonaldTrump should embrace a modest #incrase in top marginal tax rates to help pay down the #debt https://t.co/522fkID1Et @JuliePonzi @theamgreatness

@Heritage says that @realDonaldTrump has completed 64% of his agenda already. Even if he wanted to coast the rest of his presidency, he‚Äôs still the most #conservative @POTUS since #RonaldReagan.
Tonight @realDonaldTrump will tout immense successes in the economy and foreign policy. The @DNC will sneer and root for more #infanticide.

Yes, precisely correct. We see this in their space program as well. China technically spends less, but they are far more focused in ends-ways-means than we are. Less can oftentimes be more, after all (by forcing prioritization). https://t.co/pHD5Wu13M8 https://t.co/2FrsFcEMXI

@DNC calls @realDonaldTrump a #racist. Yet, black #unemployment is at historical lows b/c of #Trump's economic programs. Meanwhile, the #Democrats defend one of their governors, @RalphNortham, who wore #blackface and supports #infanticide of African-American babies. #Wow
@DNC calls @realDonaldTrump an anti-Semite when he #recognizes #Jerusalem as the capital of #Israel. Meanwhile, @IlhanMN, @RashidaTlaib, @AOC &amp; so many elected #Democrats are openly #antiSemitic. This is what #propaganda in a #Left-wing dominated media looks like.

Wow, @JRubinBlogger is nuttier now than she's ever been.
As a former professional #politico, I'm offended by the abject #amateurism that the @RalphNortham staff has displayed (as well as being offended by #Northam's insane commitment to #infanticide and #racism).
@RalphNortham seems to want to have it both ways: at the same time he denies being a racist and a baby-killer, he argues that "it was a different time" in #Virginia when he wore #blackface &amp; that #murdering a #newborn isn't really #murder. #NorthamMustResign @realDonaldTrump
@RalphNortham argues that he wore #blackface in order to emulate #MichaelJackson...even as he cannot remember Jackson's name (watch the press conference: #Northam looks to his wife and asks for the singer's name). This lowlife can't even lie well. #NorthamMustResign
#NorthamMustResign: he supports #racism and #infanticide. Naturally, he's a perfect fit for the modern @DNC--BUT NOT FOR ME! I want his arse to the curb, ASAP. #Virginia is my home and he doesn't represent my values at all! #MAGA #KAG @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi
FACT: Half of those women who get abortions every year are below the federal poverty line. FACT: of the 60 million abortions that have occurred since 1973, 20 million black women received abortions. FACT: #Northam wore #blackface &amp; supports #infanticide. #NorthamMustResign

@GovernorVA is a #pig. I want my Old #Virginia back. https://t.co/OlwB8jUJKq
It's a great question that the @Morning_Joe crew asked @HowardSchultz today: What does the @DNC stand for? After years of working in and following politics, I don't know anymore. To me, they appear to believe in #Infanticide; #tax &amp; #spending policies &amp; #Antisemitism.
@GovernorVA is a #pig. He's killing Old #Virginia with his #VirginiaAbortion #bill just like he's going to be killing those innocent babies.
I'm loving @HowardSchultz with each passing minute. It's going to be #MadMax at the #Thunderdome for the @DNC in #Election2020. **Grabs #popcorn** #MAGA #KAG @realDonaldTrump
@Morning_Joe's segment with @tombrokaw about Jimmy Carter's 1979 deal with #China &amp; @MSNBC's apparent institutional lamentations over the rise in hostility between #Beijing and #WashingtonDC are repulsive. Meanwhile, the #Globalists keep pushing us to #war w/ broke #Russia.
@NASA is #Broken. @JimBridenstine claims that it'll "take time" before the agency recovers from the #GovernmentShutdown. #WTF were they doing before the shutdown? Unless they're hiding a #Stargate Program, there's no excuse why #America doesn't have a manned spaceflight program!
#China, in the words of @davidpgoldman, views the world as nothing more than #protein with which to sustain its economy. #NeverForget that. #TradeWar #MAGA #KAG @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson
#China wants to turn the whole planet into a giant version of their #StateOwnedEnterprises in which all roads lead to #Beijing. This move by #Foxconn proves this yet again. It makes little business sense to abandon their Wisconsin deal. But, it makes perfect political sense.
@BetoORourke @staceyabrams @HillaryClinton (maybe) and 29 other #Democrats are potentially running for @POTUS in #Election2020. Not only are all of them #radicals but they are also all #losers.
The same @DNC that asbsolutely #trashed the #intelligence community over #WMD in #Iraq for the duration of the G.W. Bush presidency are now telling us that the #intelligence community cannot be questioned? @realDonaldTrump is right: #Iran is a #threat! @SebGorka @GordonGChang
Important, though #underreported #news. @GordonGChang @SebGorka https://t.co/sqTJBl1JnU
Let's get this straight: @DNC booed #God at the 2012 Democratic National Convention. They support #infanticide. And, now, they want to strike the phrase "Under God" from the House of Representatives...and they wonder why God-fearing Americans won't vote for them?
https://t.co/SfKhoTwXXJ. Those who know me know that I am an ardent defender of the general idea of and institutional necessity for an intelligence community. But, they've gotten it wrong so many times, so badly, that @realDonaldTrump's assessment of them is accurate. @SebGorka
The #Midwest hasn't been this cold since 1985, they say. The #PolarVortex2019 is supposedly some unheard of event. But, if it happened in 1985, how is this an anomalous event proving @AOC's assertion that #GlobalWaming will kill us all in 12 years? @realDonaldTrump @SebGorka
The #Left is going to #eat each other in 2020...and @HowardSchultz...and @realDonaldTrump will be president again. #MAGA #KAG

@HouseDemocrats insist that #IllegalAliens only come through "legal" ports of entry as do drugs. Yet, these talking points defy common sense. Further, the fact that the @DNC admit #BorderSecurity is important, but refuse to #BuildTheWall is also insane. Face it, they're nuts.
Like the #Soviets of old, potential @DNC presidential candidates must now go before their party rank-and-file and vow that they are the most ideologically pure of all and their rivals are aberrant ideological deviationists before being allowed to run. 2020 is going to be fun!
The @DNC is going #bonkers over @HowardSchultz's potential independent bid for president. Just when I thought watching 32 kooky #Leftists devour each other to get the DNC nomination was going to be fun to watch, now we're adding non-aligned folks to the mix! #MAGA #KAG

In a tight #football game, it is often necessary to #punt the ball in order to prevent something worse from happening. It may not be pretty or satisfying. But, it is #strategic. In 3 weeks, @realDonaldTrump goes for the #endzone at the #SOTU &amp; declares #StateOfEmergency. #MAGA
Yesterday, @EricTrump recounted the story of how @realDonaldTrump warned his family that they'd find out who their true friends were after he announced his bid for the presidency in 2016. With @POTUS' speech today, the same holds true for his supporters. 3 weeks is not #surrender
#wrong #NoGoodBrother It's a 3 week pause. How does that equate with a total "surrender" to @SpeakerPelosi and @SenSchumer? HOW?! Let's see what @realDonaldTrump does at the #SOTU before jumping to conclusions. https://t.co/6T80cY3HoS
How does someone who is "conspiring" with #Russia to rig the 2016 election reach out to #WikiLeaks and ASK #JulianAssange if he's got dirt on @HillaryClinton? If he's conspiring with Russia, why not just leak the #email? #MAGA #KAG @realDonaldTrump @dbongino @jpodhoretz

It violates #USG guidelines and proves #claims about partisanship.
