@Pseudo_RGIII ok, Rosen for the #15, and they swap Round 2 picks.
In the last 2 years, DC teams have lost the top free agent in 2 major sports.
@MarkZuckerman He's fragile
@hugenatsfan @Nationals What about Africa?
@WeekNights957 @jay_jaffe @thekolsky @ButcherBoy415 Bryce will want 10-20 more/yr
@patbrennan88 well done
@uSTADIUM I don't see how this could be accurate, given the cap hit.

@DavidHuzzard and charge $29.95 for locker rental
@MikeBastasch @DailyCaller must be hot on the reservation
@redskinstoday_ I think Wash would be his least preferred spot. No chance of success in the next few yrs, no stability in the FO, &amp;  they've got O-line problems. Jax, &amp; Denver may be the best options. And millionaires aren't concerned about moving ;)
@TheYardsDC They're jumping into the Anacostia?
@NBCSRedskins @Ourisman_Dodge Cut him now and take the cap hit.
@NBCSRedskins Bruce didn't

@TheRedskinsWire way to go out on a limb
@AroundTheNFL scam
@NBCSRedskins @JunksRadio delusional and unprepared on air
@NBCSRedskins Vernon is no more assuring  than Bruce. Compete for a championship???? WHAT??????
@Snide_Remarks Andrew Luck is 6'4" and he got several passes blocked by KC. It's more than just height.
@JPFinlayNBCS @jpfinlayNBCS, are you any more confident now? I'm not.
@AroundTheNFL But when pressed for specifics, he said he wasn't a doctor. What a clown!
@TheRedskinsWire he danced around those questions like Astaire
Alex Smith got a nice round of applause at the Wiz game.

@Bman2718 If the Nats sign Harper, I expect them to trade Eaton.
@PhillipTLatham you can't trade a free agent
@redskinstoday_ It would be so Redskins if Nusky now quits.
@JPFinlayNBCS Yes, I do. It played today aamof. Nice.

@redskinstoday_ If it's not Colt, it's no one sig better. Maybe it's Lock. But that's not the only question mark - also OL, safety, WR, DB, TE. Ugly year next year
@1067theFan No chance of a winning season in the short term. Skins have so many holes and no f/a wants to come here.

@1067theFan Time to go Skin-less
@FiftyGutBlog It's not just that they're one of the 5 worst teams over the past 20 yrs. It's also the foot-dragging, lack of transparency, and disrespect for the fans. Most teams held an end-of-year presser for the fans; the Skins don't because they don't care. The ship is sinking.
@dcsportsbog https://t.co/ya4N7fGB78
@RedskinsRD21 Maybe if he figures he can be the replacement
@SkinsRealm But it might be better than firing a DC then finding out that no DC on the market wants to go to the Skins.
@1067theFan @RossTuckerNFL @JunksRadio No. A mediocre QB behind a stud lineman is better than a stud QB behind a mediocre lineman.
If the Redskins' FO refuses to address their plans or even confirm that coaches who have left have, in fact, left, they must be leaving it up to the Twitteratti to announce and comment on their actions. Oh, and #FireBruceAllen

@skinsgo46 @NBCSRedskins fwiw, a Cards twitter site is saying trading Rosen would cost AZ $10M in cap space. If that's true, I don't see them doing it.
@J_Wiebs @BurgundyBlog or even knowing he plays baseball

Who plays better defense: Gronk or the Seattle kicker?
@czabe 1,000 times YES!!!
@1067theFan Gomes at catcher and Adams at first? Pugsley at 2nd?
Hey @masnKolko , I remember a short video maybe 6 months ago of someone (maybe a Nats player) doing quick funny impressions of Johnny Holiday &amp; Ray Knight. I remember the impressionist was sitting next to Doolittle.  Does that ring a bell for you?
@thecheckdown @Bwagz where's the flag? #homecooking
Hey @EBJunkies , Cousins is 11/16 for 50 yds.  Josh was 11/16 for 200 yds.
Cousins 11/16 for 50 yds. Josh Johnson 11/16 200 yds
Looks like the Vikings could use Josh Johnson.

@CadetFoster2017 Fair pt.  I'd like to see a civilized debate in Congress about how easy/hard it is to get guns. also like to see the specific demands of marchers - not readily available. But what I'd most like to see is a specific plan - from anyone - to prevent  criminals from obtaining guns.

Where do the #Nats turn now that Realmuto is gone? Lucroy?
@redskins_fgsn Quitter
@peterbrasile How is the $24M they're paying Smith more than the $34M they would have had to pay Kirk?
@ideasurge I don't think he went thru all this crap to settle for &lt;27 per year
@BigManPauly @Redskins But if they were convinced Kirk was gone (and, therefore, the Kirk money was available for someone else), they didn't have to make this trade first.  They could've re-signed ZB and then worry about a new QB (and possibly backloaded Smith's contract).
@TonyPerkinsFOX5 They are similar.  But Kirk would've cost at least $5M more per year, and wasn't as good as Smith last year. The Skins must've felt that losing Fuller to get Smith was better than hoping that a QB they like would slip to #13.  And they are getting a 3rd as compensation for Kirk.
@thorpe_matt @Redskins Without Fuller, Smith wudda been traded elsewhere...and the Skins would be without a QB and thinking the draft is a "crapshoot"
@CTowersCBS Smith &amp; Cousins are in the same neighborhood.  But Smith had a better year last year, and is $5M/yr cheaper.  Maybe the Skins didn't want to commit to Kirk for more than 3 years.
@WillBrinson Or like this:  He traded a Pro-Bowl QB for 2 3rd-round picks (1 is Fuller)

Ok Dusty, Chapman is available again. What do you do? #Nats
@MLBONFOX @Holdenradio Nats pursue Murphy then?
@joshuetree ok thanks.  But still, just 1 current one - that's hardly prevalence
The Skins sure could've used some of those mysterious Muslim sports heroes last nite.
24 hrs later &amp; still no one has come up with a single Muslim sports hero from this century.
@NYDailyNews @joshuetree @realDonaldTrump Can you come up with one in this century maybe?
@MarcEdelman but nobody in the last 20 years?  and I don't think a .217 hitter is a hero to anyone
Why is it more important for us to seal Turkey's border before our own?

Kirk Cousins - best QB  in the NFL EAST!!!
Today, Kirk can prove he's the best QB in the NFL East. @HTTR
WH Press Sec said refugees undergo extensive screening before entering US...prob not the case for those who sneak in.
Bleacher Report ranks the team they previously called the Redskins 13th (ahead of Seattle). Even the haters are coming around. #HTTR
@Kgskins26 May be too early for Jay, but makes sense for Kirk.  He's the best F/A QB &amp; the top 3 college QBs will be gone when we draft.
In Dusty we Trusty @dbaker_12

Will Pagano return to the Ravens next season (after he gets fired)?
Phillip Rivers now has more kids (8) than INTs (7).
So the Nats will choose between 2 remaining managerial options:  a Black guy &amp; a black guy.
I didn't recognize Ray Lewis on the pre-game show...he wasn't on his phone.

@redskins_fanly Maybe.  What can we get - a 3rd roudner?  The Ravens can't give us any secondary help
What's the trade value of Andre Roberts?
BREAKING: Papelbon just stole Harper's lunch money and stuffed him into his own locker.  The principal didn't see a thing.

@EBJunkies I guess that makes Kirk the best QB in the NFL now. HTTR!
Harbaugh complaining about the legality of a hit is a bit like John Wilkes Booth complaining about guns in theatres. #HTTR

Among the remaining DC candidates for the Skins, only Mangini has acting experience, having appeared on The Sopranos...so there's that.
@Snide_Remarks @bmcnally14 If the Nats sign Max &amp; trade Stras, how does that make it any more likely they'll sign Zimm?

@Tom_Schad @StrickSkin 31 starts

@SteveSoboroff @jadande @johngreen I'm resisting arrest.  I'm resisting arrest.
Friends of mine got married Saturday, and they will be at the MNF game tonite wearing "Bride" and "Groom" jerseys
Still waiting for someone to tell me how Chris Baker's routine block on a QB-turned-defender can be classified as a cheap shot.
BREAKING:  Adrian Peterson just picked up Bing Crosby in his fantasy draft.
Tim Howard woulda blocked that missle.
John Belushi would've wanted USA Soccer to beat Germany to avenge their bombing of Pearl Harbor.
With apologies to Matchbox Twenty, "If you're Ghana, maybe it's time to go home."

Time to change the name from "Wizards" back to "Bullets"  Can we round up some real wizards who are deeply offended by the name?
I think Noah from the Bible could guard Nene better

At nightfall, the Nats will honor the gods with the blood of the Cards.
If the Skins really wanna create a buzz, all they gotta do is sign Chris Kluwe.  HTTR.
