And this is the face of that evil and diabolical CEO of Papa Johns, Alec Baldwin https://t.co/3gyybtErl2
So the agent got his help in tracking down Papa, and idk what I take when I go to bed but it’s great.
This guy had also replaced every part to an old car with wood and made it the fastest car in the world. The agent eventually told him that there was a break in the case and that he was found innocent. On the other hand, the man who was falsely convicted had also started a cult.
a murder case had found him guilty in killing his parents. This guy had been living on his own for years off the land, and when the agent found him he had telepathic control of prairie dogs and meerkats who captured the agent and water boarded him in swamp water.
This agent rescues the kids but finds that Papa has kangaroos with boxing gloves and a dog that shits water. After hand cleaning up a scene in a house full of carpet, it zooms out to this agent’s first case, where he had to save a man who had run into the jungle after
A dream: the CEO of Papa Johns was bribing kids at a scout camp with a Domino’s flier to come live with him bc he had no love and never had any relationship as a child. An agent had to go and find them bc the Papa had started a cult following.
