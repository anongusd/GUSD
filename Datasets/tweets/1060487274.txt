If Democrats want to come to the table that is set to address America’s mental health crisis &amp; the human factors contributing to mass violence, they’ll find that their colleagues across the aisle have been here working on real solutions for some time. They’re welcome to join us.
To be clear, the task before us is to identify solutions that actually save lives.
This legislation shows us that they are less interested in adopting solutions to prevent mass violence than in promoting gun control.
Recent shootings reflect failures not of existing policy—background checks are already in place and working across the board—but failures in its implementation.

I just voted to fund our government, #CHIP, and our military—again. Why? Because Democrats walked away from a bipartisan bill that serves American citizens to focus on non-citizens. That's the story of the #SchumerShutdown.
Join me at noon on @FoxBusiness to talk about the #SchumerShutdown—the one in which Senate Democrats refuse to pass a #CHIP extension that saves taxpayer $ and helps 14,791 #GA09 kids access health care.

232,050 kids in Georgia rely on #CHIP, which I voted to fund for the next 6 years. Join me on @FoxNews at 7:30 this evening to talk about the #SchumerShutdown and what it means for children and troops.
As part of the @AirForceReserve, I find the #SchumerShutdown disturbingly irresponsible. Our military men and women deserve our immediate and unwavering support, which the House demonstrated by voting this week to fund our defense. https://t.co/FDvjboqNPS
#SchumerShutdown feels more and more like a shakedown. Who are the losers? Children on #CHIP, men and women who serve in our military, their families, Americans at large . . .
Democrats shut down the govt to protect illegals last night. Just to be clear, American troops and the children relying on #CHIP didn't make the cut on the Dems' top priorities. #SchumerShutdown
While Democrats shut down the govt to protect illegals this week, @HouseGOP voted to keep the government open, support our troops, fund CHIP for 6 years (saving taxpayer money), and protect vulnerable newborns from infanticide. #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/lk4yOW6Sif
Thanks to @ShannonBream on @FoxNews for talking about the consequences of refusing to fund our troops. How can Dems say they're being honest about real world problems like North Korea when they're not willing to provide funding for our military service members? #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/6EzVw8Djwt
Looking forward to joining @ShannonBream tonight at 12:15. https://t.co/wo3GFZQF9c
House Republicans voted to fund #CHIP for 6 more years, but children relying on this health care program apparently aren't a priority in the brave new world of a #SchumerShutdown. #priorities
Let's break down the question of a gov't shutdown. Senate Dems are using the 60-vote #cloture rule to hold American troops and children hostage. Those who support the #SchumerShutdown have some explaining to do to, well, every American. @HouseGOP https://t.co/K9aco7qiak

When did funding #CHIP for 6 years become a "doggie-do" sundae? Didn't Pelosi say "Congress has no more sacred duty than protecting the health of our children"? Is it supporting our troops or keeping the govt open that makes extending CHIP so noxious to her now? https://t.co/F1vP72Q9im

@PressSec Wanna lower health care costs? Look at PBMs' misbehavior. Texas saved $128 per prescription by applying our law at state level.

#CommunityPharm can't speak freely, but we can--on behalf of the Americans that PBMs' predatory practices are hurting. @Rx_Specialty

The MAC Transparency Act is vitally important to restoring fairness in reimbursements to independent and #communitypharmacists.
Let's be facilitators that allow #communitypharmacists to continue to focus on patients, and not the relentless intimidation of PBMs
@RepBuddyCarter is right, small business is the backbone of America. The way PBMs undermine #communitypharmacists is downright un-American
PBMs own their own mail order pharmacy, and financially penalize patients that choose to use their #communitypharmacy instead
PBM's are not auditing pharmacies to make sure they're safe. They're auditing them to make money #communitypharmacists
Counseling by a pharmacist is proven to be the most effective method for ensuring patients take medications, saving billions of dollars.

Thanks to everyone who followed along. Grateful for opportunity to talk about free market principles and Georgia songwriters at #ASCAPEXPO
I've talked about gov overreg of music. But many other areas where fed gov is too involved. What are some other areas that come to mind?
Proud to work w @repjeffries to end gov overreg of songwriters. 50k in Georgia. Time to bring free market to music industry. #ASCAPEXPO
RT if you agree that music has value. Founders believed work of our mind is as worthy of protecting as the work of our hands. #ascapexpo
Lots of amens in the room when @RepJeffries says my preaching voice comes out when I talk about doing the right thing. #ASCAPEXPO
I want my kids and your kids to be able to pursue dreams, whatever they may be. Free market is the foundation for opportunity. #ASCAPEXPO
The Constitution enshrines our God-given rights. Including property rights. Intellectual property is a stick in the bundle. #ascapexpo
Want the facts? #songwriterequityact #ASCAPEXPO http://t.co/pZQ3oFS0t0
.@RepJeffries shares powerful quote from Churchill. Paraphrase: You have enemies? Good. Means you're fighting for something. #ASCAPEXPO
A little about me: one of the first dates I went on with my beautiful bride Lisa over 25 years ago was to a hootenanny. #ascapexpo
In northeast Georgia the music tradition is country, gospel and shape notes. What is your music tradition? #ASCAPEXPO
Here is what I tell big tech and broadcasters who want to shortchange songwriters: What's fair is fair. What's right is right. #ASCAPEXPO
"I love the technology...but that doesn't necessarily mean I want to be subject to laws that hold us back." -@aloeblacc #ASCAPEXPO
Great point by my friend @RepJeffries- copyright is a constitutional right. #standwithsongwriters #ASCAPEXPO
The dynamic of the music industry is changing. We have to get government out of the way and let the free market work. #ASCAPEXPO
Do you think the federal government should prevent a creator from negotiating in a free market? I don't. #standwithsongwriters #ascapexpo
"It's just about what's fair." -@aloeblacc #ASCAPEXPO #standwithsongwriters http://t.co/l4L8EJXj8q
Thanks for the warm welcome and shoutout to my home, the great state of Georgia .@IMPaulWilliams http://t.co/Rh1o9rTsdd
#songwriterequityact makes two changes to copyright law. 1. judge can consider market evidence when setting rates. 2. free market standard
"It's making sure songwriters are treated like everyone else and have a fair shot to negotiate in a free market" -@IMPaulWilliams #ASCAPEXPO
"One million streams on @pandora_radio pays only about 90 dollars total to writer and publisher" -@IMPaulWilliams #ASCAPEXPO
"We want to change outdated gov regs that allow big streaming services to shortchange writers and publishers" - @IMPaulWilliams #ASCAPEXPO
.@IMPaulWilliams starts off the panel joking about our height difference. Who knew #musiclicensing could be so fun! #ASCAPEXPO
DYK: If songwriters and composers want to license their creation, federal government often mandates what they get paid. #ASCAPEXPO

ICYMI: My full statement on #ExecutiveAction remarks last night http://t.co/vYLJOsGEH7
Compassion is giving Americans and #immigrants the nation of laws they cherish. Not forcing your agenda with pen and phone.
Obama has had 6 yrs to work with Congress. 2 with his party in total control. Only now, citing scripture, this issue warrants action?
This #ImmigrationAction is political retribution under the false guise of compassion. This isn't what compassion looks like.
Americans choosing a Republican Congress gives a Democrat president more power than he had before? http://t.co/cKeAPlzkGl
Many #immigrants came to the US from places where the law and will of the people are ignored. Pres Obama wants to give them more of the same
@perribates absolutely. This #executiveaction is a terrible abuse of power.

In just a few minutes, at 8:46am, I hope you'll take a moment to remember our #FallenHeroes of #September11. We can never forget.
For me and my constituents, I believe that’s a world without terror—not “rolled back” or “degraded” terror, but no terror. That is our hope.
What’s most troubling is that President Obama didn’t define what victory over ISIL will look like.
I’m working around the clock for other legislative answers to provide the leadership the world needs.
That’s why I introduced the Visa Waiver Program Suspension.
President Obama took several generalizations and called them a strategy tonight.
@emily_chauncey Please understand I wasn't "blocking" anything. Procedure is important &amp; it's my job to make sure bills pass as intended.

@jaybookmanajc as you pointed out, they get deportation hearings. Not as cut and dried as you'd like the twitterverse to think.
@jaybookmanajc I think you have me confused w someone else in your feed. I didn't urge POTUS to break any laws. Said he should enforce.
@jaybookmanajc Jay, you know we have an immigration system in this country. Even if you don't like it, it's there.
@jaybookmanajc  is that what you'd tell all here legally, awaiting citizenship? Why bother? Like POTUS you seem to pick the laws you like...
@jaybookmanajc enforcing immigration instead laws of pushing amnesty in 1st place wouldn't have drawn them to our border in these numbers.
No, @BarackObama, the answer is that you enforce the law and protect this country's borders.

#Lerner has a responsibility to the American people she claimed to serve and the Congress they chose to represent them.#IRS #contempt
This vote is a commitment to the American people that this Congress is here to make their government accountable to them. #contempt #lerner

Just recorded a response to tonight's #SOTU. Watch for it at .@HouseGOP! http://t.co/HZKP6S4fC2
Full response: http://t.co/cHHOVncEsM #SOTU
Americans need #POTUS to allow their representatives in Congress to finally implement the solutions we've proposed #SOTU
Instead of reaching for his pen and phone, #POTUS needs to open his eyes and heart, see what his policies have done to real Americans #SOTU
#POTUS tone and message make clear that Congress needs to reclaim the responsibilities outlined in Article I of the Constitution #SOTU
Concerns over negligent foreign policy, abuses at the highest level of government, and Obamacare are still unresolved #SOTU
POTUS track record of irresponsible executive power warrants a lot more explanation than what Americans heard tonight #SOTU
The #SOTU should be a report on the condition of the country, not a forecast of the next partisan political whims POTUS has in store.
Tonight, President Obama once again stood in the People’s House and placed his own interests above theirs.
