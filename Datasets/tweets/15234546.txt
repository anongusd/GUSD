Are Americans more likely today to threaten physical violence against people on the other side of political disputes?Or is it our hypermedia age that gives too many people easy, anonymous means to fling threats and curses at people like Ashley Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford?
@benshapiro Agreed. One way witnesses are discredited at trial is through evidence they have fabricated before. People don‚Äôt just decide at 51 yrs old to tell a giant public lie. Evidence of prior fabrication in a witness‚Äô life is important. So is its absence‚Äînot dispositive, but probative.

@MattM3502 At the presidential level, yes. But, as you know, not in the electoral college. And at other levels of government, Democrats have lost more than a thousand offices‚Äîincluding 13 senate seats in recent years, leaving them with a steep challenge to block Trump‚Äôs SCOTUS pick.
@jedshug @jadler1969 That‚Äôs so weak. Your ‚Äútradition‚Äù is just a hodge-podge of cherry-picking, uninformed speculation, coincidence, and tendentiousness. You‚Äôre better off calling for raw exercises of partisan power, when Dems have it again, than trying to dress it all up with this ahistorical bunkum.
After the 2016 election, there were calls to abolish the electoral college. Now, after Kennedy‚Äôs retirement, there are calls to ‚Äúpack‚Äù the Supreme Court.		Whatever the merits and political viability of these proposals, at some point, Dems will need to win more races.
@AngusRockford You are making my point precisely. Threats of bogus impeachment by Republicans would, under this spurious ‚Äútradition,‚Äù prevent every Democratic president from appointing SCOTUS justices. And vice versa. There is no such ‚Äútradition.‚Äù Starting one is desperate. Win elections.
@CitedForClarity @brbassoff @mattyglesias Robert Jackson is one of the greatest lawyers in American history. He essentially apprenticed in law. A different time, for sure. Today, an era of credentialism, he‚Äôd never get away with it.
This ‚Äútradition,‚Äù concerning which there is little actual evidence, would operate as an invitation to partisans to threaten impeachment, and thereby block any nomination to the Court. It is founded on speculation, coincidence and frustration. https://t.co/khjcVLqjv2
@jedshug Court observers have noticed a slight shake developing in Justice Kennedy‚Äôs arm; he tries to hide it. Also, without getting specific, I can tell you his wife was unwell recently; Kennedy spent a lot of time with her. He‚Äôs 81; he and Mary have known each other since childhood.
@jedshug Rank ‚Äúspeculation.‚Äù Stevens served until 2010! And he was at the Court last week hiring law clerks for next year...and the next year, when he will be 100 years old. It‚Äôs false to say this man‚Äîstill spry and sharp at 98, though a bit hard of hearing‚Äîwas ready to retire in 1977.

@DevinGordonX @jackshafer The prom joke is an appearance joke, and meant to hurt. To pretend otherwise is obtuse.
@DevinGordonX @jackshafer I‚Äôm also pretty certain that if Dennis Miller or someone took down a progressive staffer on national TV like that, we‚Äôd be reading thumbsuckers in the Times about it.
@DevinGordonX @jackshafer You don‚Äôt get a pass on being cruel because you aren‚Äôt the president. And the WHCA dinner was by tradition not a roast. A bit of a singe at best.
@DevinGordonX @jackshafer The argument that ‚ÄúTrump does it, so it‚Äôs OK if we do it‚Äù is, to me, a surrender to the hatred of the Trump era. To see liberals rush to become the worst version of themselves because Trump is the worst version of himself is a defeat for the democracy I‚Äôd like to live in.
@DevinGordonX @jackshafer I live in London. I have nothing to do with White House coverage. I called out what I thought was uncivil cruelty. I know these days we are all supposed to cheer hatefulness when our team does it, and gin up outrage when it‚Äôs the other side. But I don‚Äôt play that.
@RandyEBarnett Look, I slammed Wolf for her unfunny hatefulness. But let‚Äôs be honest here: the GOP not only normalized uncivil crudity. They nominated it for president.
@Fran_Neena20409 @whpresscorps Only the government can censor you. One person expressing an opinion is NOT censorship.

@ggld I hold them both to the same standard I hold myself and the rest of us: a decent person and a good citizen. Trump very often fails to meet that standard. We all do, on our worst days. But the point is to rise above. Be better than the worst among us. Democracy depends on it.
@about_scout I know who she works for. And I hold no brief for her as an individual or as press secretary. I just don‚Äôt think the joke is fair comment or funny in the least. And I think the attitude it reflects is part of what is dragging us all down as a country. Rise above.

@ysBones @AshaRangappa_ @just_security I'm simply inviting you to read something. Sheesh, if I had known that would have terrified you so much, I would have put an adults-only warning on it!
@WaynesterAtl @RichardGrenell @JammieWF Shape your own narrative. If you want to do it after reading more perspectives and context on the historical practice of obtaining FISA warrants, fine. If not--that's fine, too. Hope you have a nice day.
@MMouseUSA @RichardGrenell I thought at the time and continue to think that HRC's private server was a shady and selfish move, a dereliction of her duty, an incredibly arrogant attempt to evade public accountability for her work in the public sector. So there.
@ebc2017ebc @RichardGrenell It means understanding the actual historical practice of obtaining a FISA warrant. It means putting the memo in a factually accurate context, rather than simply hollering at each other about it. It's like learning about a business before investing in it.
@Mildredhrn4 @RichardGrenell Americans are wicked smart. That's why I'm not afraid to release the memo. Or recommend we all learn a bit more about how the FISA process actually works, so we can use our excellent minds to assess its significance. And--I never mentioned gender. That's a bullshit evasion.
@jg091297 @JammieWF @AshaRangappa_ @just_security I can't speak for others. I've never treated the FBI like a holy cow. It's a government agency--works well sometimes, not so well at other times. All I would ask is that people delve a little deeper into the FISA process, to help them judge what happened here.
@RichardGrenell Not at all. I'm fine with releasing the memo. I'm suggesting we all get MORE info. MORE debates and discussion about its significance. MORE reporting on the historical practice of the FISA process it focuses on. Why would you be uncomfortable with more info/perspectives?
@luvofUSA @AshaRangappa_ @just_security I'm perfectly fine with the memo being released. And fine with people debating and discussing its significance from all kinds of perspectives. And fine with reporting on the context and historical practice of the FISA process it focuses on. The more info, the better.

@SneakyBlackDog @GenghisKhet @JammieWF @AshaRangappa_ @just_security It's about understanding the actual historical practice of obtaining a FISA warrant. The context. That's like saying, "Why do I need announcers when I watch baseball?"--when this is the first ballgame you've ever watched. Why be afraid of context?
@FromFlyover @AshaRangappa_ @just_security No. It's an invitation to read and learn about the actual historical practice and legal context of the process of obtaining a FUSA warrant, so the Nunes memo can be assessed from a point of deeper understanding. Why would you be so afraid of that information?
@SprayCanAnn @AshaRangappa_ @just_security Maybe. But the writer is attempting to describe a fact of federal practice in this area: Federal judges aren't idiots. She used sarcasm to make the point. But I've been in plenty of federal courtrooms--and she's right. Once in a while, you get a rummy. But most are pros.
@Mildredhrn4 @AshaRangappa_ @just_security Why reject a deeper level of discussion on the context and historical practice of how FISA warrants are obtained by federal prosecutors? No one said anything about gender. That's a bullshit evasion.  Sure, release the memo. And then read it with an informed perspective.
@SprayCanAnn @AshaRangappa_ @just_security Serious question: What's liberal about learning the actual process federal law enforcement must go through to obtain a FISA warrant? Why would you condemn a deeper exploration of the actual history and context of how FISA warrants work?

@boplowden And economists will tell you that when the government tries to choose winners and losers through the tax code it distorts economic choices and invites rent-seeking behaviors based on tax avoidance opportunities rather than wealth creation. Conservatives used to understand this.
@EndDeepState No. That's not the way it works. When you close loopholes tax revenues will go up. So you can slash rates. A helluva lot. Reagan's '86 bill took the top income tax rate from 50 percent to 28 percent. THAT'S tax reform.
@boplowden That's not an economic policy argument. Just ad hominem expectoration. Plus a little snark and snobbery. It's Twitter. I shouldn't expect better.
@boplowden When it comes to tax reform, I'm a Reaganite. I covered the '86 bill, thought it a great legislative achievement, making our tax code both more efficient and more just. And done through bipartisan leadership. Trump hated it. Natch.
@RandyEBarnett I'm all for cutting taxes. The question is: How? This bill--with all its new loopholes--actually reflects the belief that government is all-wise, that politicians can determine that some people's income is better than others, some economic choices better. Reagan this ain't.
Lower rates are good. Adding more loopholes and tax shelters is bad. They encourage more people to make economic decisions based on tax avoidance rather than wealth creation. Our tax code hobbles our economy with inefficient incentives. This bill makes that problem worse.
@laddydogH @guypbenson Lower rates are good. Adding more loopholes and tax shelters is bad. They encourage more people to make economic decisions based on tax avoidance rather than wealth creation. Our tax code hobbles our economy with inefficient incentives. This bill makes that problem worse.
@guypbenson The bill cuts individual rates--a bit; corporate rates--a lot. That's sound policy. But tax reform this ain't. The pass-through and carried interest provisions are incoherent. Plus--more tax shelters! It's really just industrial policy/special-interest giveaways using the code.
@NotMe91422 @jbouie Yes. Both Democrats and Republicans have for decades larded up the tax code with complexities simply to reward their donors and burden those they disfavor. The result is a code that is both less efficient and less just. This bill is no different. The Swamp won again.
@Bluewater22 @guypbenson Absolutely nothing--since 1986, when Dan Rostenkowski, Bill Bradley and other Dems worked with Ronald Reagan, Jack Kemp and other Reps to slash tax rates and close thousands of loopholes. The '86 bill made the code more efficient and more just. Trump hated it--back then.
Democrats and Republicans for decades have larded up the tax code with complexities simply to reward donors. This bill is no different. It incentivizes even more economic behavior to focus on tax avoidance rather than wealth creation. More industrial policy enforced by the IRS.
@TeelowM3 Sanders is talking about the rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. That is a different metric than the Gross Domestic Product. I compared apples to apples; you, apples to autos. And, yes, Obama inherited an economy in free-fall; Trump, a stable, slow-growing  economy. #facts

@redsteeze It didn't do all it promised. Many predicted that. So it needed either fixes (Democrats) or a complete replacement (GOP). That's governing.

@klcmurphy @aravosis The child was not "brain dead." The evidence of suffering was that he was intubated--like millions of people. Many things can't be cured.
@aravosis The hospital decided it was in the best interest of the child that he die. The parents disagreed. The court sided with the hospital. UK law.

@BPOGrady Not clear. But there's a case to be made that the Constitution does grant the president that kind of authority.
@NotoriousRBF That would be up to congressional Republicans. In 1974--after years of revelations--Republicans on Judiciary Committee stood by Nixon, 11-6.

@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson @POTUS It has everything to do with country over party. History will show that--however this all turns out.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson @POTUS Country over party. The real American way. Good night.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson @POTUS Wow. Even after the tapes reveal Nixon directly ordering crimes from the Oval Office? Here is where we disagree. For me--country over party.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson You don't believe President Trump's own DCI/DNI? You don't think they have evidence to say DNC servers were attacked by Russia? So be it.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson @POTUS Not in June '72.And right up to 1974, Nixon supporters--blinded by their partisan loyalties--demanded an end to the investigation. Familiar?
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson @POTUS Again: President Trump's own DCI and DNI have confirmed in testimony that Russian intelligence agencies--GRU/FSB--carried out DNC hack.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson And the DNC. Again: President Trump's own DCI and DNI have confirmed this attack. It is a fact.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson Sure. It was wrong. Let's investigate by all means. If those involved (Dems or GOP) have nothing to hide, they have nothing to fear.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson @POTUS Also--do you think no US laws were broken? The DNC hack alone is a violation of federal laws. Hacking is a serious crime.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson @POTUS No one tied Nixon to the break-in at first. No one suspected Nixon was involved in Watergate nine months after it happened. We investigated.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson Trump's own DCI and DNI have confirmed publicly it was Russia, based on their knowledge of classified evidence. All leads should be followed
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson A mountain of targeted disinformation. Also--cyberattacks may have been furthered but US persons.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson Why are you so afraid?Do you think Trump has something to hide?
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson But the attack went far beyond technology. There was disinformation, cyberattacks, likely espionage. And possible involvement by US persons.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson @POTUS There was no evidence of any crime by Richard Nixon in June 1972--even though he committed one on June 21.It took an investigation to reveal
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson @POTUS It is the opinion of DCI/DNI that our country was attacked. There is evidence that might--MIGHT--show US persons involved. So: Investigate.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson @POTUS You don't start with a crime. You end with it--a jury verdict. You start with probable cause--reasonable suspicion. Then dig, without fear.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson @POTUS He did nothing we know of. There are facts which involve people close to him--Manafort, Kushner, Trump Jr. "Leads." You follow them.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson These aren't talking points. They're my ideals. As for logic--let's find out the facts. That's logical. Anyway, late here.Nice talking. Bye.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson @POTUS I disagree. Mueller is a stand-up guy. Unanimously confirmed by Senate. I truly hope Trump is cleared, runs again in a fair 2020 election.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson The FBI is the DOJ, led by Sessions, who recused himself. And appointed Mueller.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson It's more than cyber. This was a classic 21st Century, Putin-designed attack. I saw similar ops in Crimea, Poland, even here in UK.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson I am not on a soapbox. I am looking for the common ground Americans used to share more easily: Love of our country. Instead, you hurl scorn.

@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson I see no evidence of crime by them at all at this point. But why short-circuit the investigation into a major attack on our country?
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson I see no evidence of crime by them at all at this point. But why short-circuit the investigation into a major attack on our country?

@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson It's unfair for you to hurl that insult at me. We are on the same team! USA! We can disagree. But we must defend this country TOGETHER.

@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson Haven't we gone over this? So: What? The Russian attack on the 2016 election, confirmed by Trump's DCI, DNI. Why? Because we love America.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson There is no hard evidence now that Trump was involved. The investigation is about the attack; if he had nothing to do with it, he's fine.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson No one should let their partisan support or opposition to Trump distort this necessary investigation. Let it proceed,with secrecy and order.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson It demonstrated our vulnerabilities.Defending our country means investigating how.Again: Trump won fair and square.But let's defend the USA!
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson But this is a significant challenge to the USA.We need to get to the bottom of it. No American should have anything to fear from the truth.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson Don't be afraid! Our system works! Believe me, I think it'd be best if all this turns out to be nothing, and we have a good election in '20.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson Ask Trump's appointees, DCI Pompeo and DNI Coats. Both have said the classified evidence is clear: Russia attacked the US election.
@rhill22733 @WildBill4701 @guypbenson If a person claiming to represent the government of a hostile foreign power asked me if they could help me attack my country--I'd say no.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson Who said such a thing? Not me. If you voted for Trump--good! You and I may or may not agree. But we can together defend the USA.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson Who said such a thing? Not me. If you voted for Trump--good! You and I may or may not agree. But we can together defend the USA.

@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson Trump won. Hillary lost. That's a fact. AND Russia attacked us. That's a fact. I don't know why any patriot would deny it.
