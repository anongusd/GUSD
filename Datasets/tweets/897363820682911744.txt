The employed youths will then be paying taxes as paye to the govt...@ahmednasirlaw ,@RobertAlai ,@DavidNdii @BenjiNdolo ...is this practical and viable ? ? ?

Me thinks instead of securing this secret (billion dollar)chineese loans,the govt should instead be negotiating with chineese companies to come and invest here and start manufacturing (only those that manufacture goods that are not produced locally) then they be given tax waivers
