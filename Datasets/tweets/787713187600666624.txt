If you extol reason, then what matters is the integrity of the thoughts, not the personalities of the thinkers - Steven Pinker
Those who make a pro gun argument deifying the founding fathers have shown themselves to hold antithetical beliefs to those founding fathers, who stood against the deification of people.
@Skutchdraws @MadMarx__ @shaun_jen @Boogie2988 I think that's a fair point on the personal outlook and I concede on that point. I don't however think that one can efficiently learn from history without acknowledging the full complexity of lives.
@Skutchdraws @MadMarx__ @shaun_jen @Boogie2988 Sure. My point is do you want people to look back and only look at the "moral wrong" that you did, or understand that you did what you saw best, given the time and place you were placed in. i.e. can we really reduce ones life with all its complexities to relative moral wrongs.
@MadMarx__ @shaun_jen @Boogie2988 My contention with the original tweet was not due my admiration of the founding fathers, in fact that would be antithetical to what they wanted. My contention lies at trying to reduce complex lives during a difficult periods of time to relative moral judgments.
@MadMarx__ @shaun_jen @Boogie2988 I don't recall my admiration of it's perfection, but anyhow...
@MadMarx__ @shaun_jen @Boogie2988 Was the United States Government dismantled? Or, for example was slavery abolished in the form of an amendment?
@MadMarx__ @shaun_jen @Boogie2988 You missed the point completely. Those "insert descriptors" implemented a government in which those very things were reduced or abolished, did they partake in immoral actions? Yes, but you can't escape that they laid the ground work for that progress to occur.
@MadMarx__ @shaun_jen @Boogie2988 Making moral judgments as an opposition to an idea that would then transpire to be within the bounds of your moral lens, I find ridiculous, but to each his own. I wish I could live long enough to see the moral arbiters of the future condemn you for what you claim moral.

@heatedsith @demotimvator Don't get me wrong I kind of understand where you're coming. I know this is a difficult subject to discuss as these are people who have experienced a great deal of trauma and I'm sympathetic to that more than you'll know.
@heatedsith @demotimvator You don't have to take sides to investigate someones claim. Detectives do this all the time. They have to be objective in all their cases. Of course they're human so some might get emotionally involved.
@heatedsith @demotimvator It surely doesn't involve taking sides.
@demotimvator It's bad in the sense that Women shouldn't have to accept sexual advances with a man or someone with power to get a position in Hollywood. Changing this is of course not bad, but the way it's done could also be. The whole, "the road to hell is paved with good intentions."
@heatedsith @demotimvator Sure, but that wasn't my point. My point was we shouldn't outright believe someones accusation. There needs to be a level of skepticism that allows the accuser to have their claim taken seriously while also allowing the accused not to be automatically assumed guilty.
@heatedsith @demotimvator And I agree the court system doesn't work 100% of the time, but until we find something better I have no choice but to advocate its use in society. Contrary to the, as I see it, believe women no matter what system.
@heatedsith @demotimvator Sure in the realm of public opinion it's fine to believe whatever you want, although that does lead most times to the accused being ostracized by a mere accusation. Whether that's good or bad I guess is relative.
@heatedsith @demotimvator I'm all for giving the benefit of the doubt. It's a heinous crime that should be pursued if allegations are made. I'm just against the idea of outright belief of an accusation. As I also believe in due process.
@BibleReloaded Nukes for everyone!

@RationalDis @PunishedAngry As for economic inequalities I completely agree. Class differences transcend these social groups and is the cause for most perceived social inequalities. that's why I'm for a living wage and tying it to inflation, universal health care, &amp; free college.
@RationalDis @PunishedAngry Say there was this overwhelming pressure from society to steer people away from certain interests. This still doesn't prevent them institutionally from pursuing them. There's still equality of opportunity for them to do so. Regardless of social pressures.

Although, I agree it's a shitty reason for becoming a Nazi. It doesn't mean people don't make decisions from shitty reasoning.
