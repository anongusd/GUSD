@AgentsofSHIELD I‚Äôd also like to see Jemma become the new permanent Director. I think the character is suitable for the job and I think it‚Äôs time they had another female director. I also hope SHIELD itself will be legitimised and fully restored to its pre-Hydra status once again.
@TheTimelessRoom I have an idea for a potential episode in season 3: the team learns that Rittenhouse is planning to take action against Empress Marie Feodorvana in 1916 &amp; find themselves, like her, conflicted over helping her in deposing her son Tsar Nicholas II to save Russia.
@AgentsofSHIELD I‚Äôm very glad there will be a season 6 :) I hope some previous main cast members will come back and I‚Äôd actually like to see @Lil_Henstridge become the new Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Jemma Simmons has a very good ring to it.

@ABCDesignated To be honest, I wasn‚Äôt happy with that. Moss is a very good character and I would like to see him stay on as Secretary of State - and promoted to a regular. I‚Äôd also like to see who Kirkman‚Äôs new Vice President and who the rest of the Cabinet are.

@AlexMohajer @KeithOlbermann @dsoderstrom This article is why I believe officially swearing in Hillary is the only real solution to this situation. She certainly deserves the office.

@AlexMohajer @KeithOlbermann You two would be awesome together - you're both amazing journalists
@AlexMohajer @BonnieblueBlue can only happen with Hilary as President. I'm not going to give up hope on that.
@AlexMohajer @BonnieblueBlue Republican and a new election has too many potential pitfalls. America needs a strong leader and a competent government right now. And that
@AlexMohajer @BonnieblueBlue I believe it will happen. It's the right thing to do and it's the only real solution to this situation. No one wants Pence or another
@AlexMohajer @BonnieblueBlue Despite everything though, I'm convinced/hopeful that they will finally recognise &amp; officially swear in Hillary as the legitimate President.
@BonnieblueBlue I'm like that some days as well.
@BonnieblueBlue My respect for him as dropped a bit since then.
@BonnieblueBlue @AlexMohajer Some days I dread looking at the news because there's bound to be something about him making headlines.
@BonnieblueBlue @AlexMohajer My country's first female Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, was treated really badly
@AlexMohajer @BonnieblueBlue saying that he regrets not running for President in 2016. To me, he's clearly implying that this situation is somehow Hillary's fault.
@AlexMohajer @BonnieblueBlue Exactly. Which is why I'm angry at VP Biden and GOP Senator Sasse saying that Biden would have won in a landslide if he had run that Biden
@BonnieblueBlue @AlexMohajer There are still double standards about women &amp; power - and yet history has several examples of strong women with power ruling very well.
@AlexMohajer I'm also astonished that some on the Democratic side are actually blaming her for this situation. It's completely unfair &amp; totally illogical
@AlexMohajer I remain convinced/hopeful that Hillary will be in the White House later this year. She deserves it after everything she's been put through.
@AlexMohajer It really is startling just how strong that sense of denial is on their respective parts
@DylanBruno12 I haven't heard of this movie before but it sounds really good :)
@AlexMohajer @SenJeffMerkley @ArianaGrande I applaud both Senator Merkley's strength of character and his physical stamina. Amazing job :)

@TVdub @BrenFosterReal Sounds like fun :)
@TVdub @BrenFosterReal You two have always been two of my favourites from the show :)
@TVdub I would certainly volunteer to help. Some best friends are involved with charity &amp; non-profits and I help them out however I can.
@TVdub That's very hardcore and I'd like to see you do that to :)
@TVdub Is there anything that you haven't already done on the show that you want to do in Season 4?
@TVdub I went there in 2011 and it was a terrific place :) I've been wanting to go back there for a long time :)
@TVdub How did the work in Senegal go?
@TVdub I miss both her and President Michener - I was really shocked when that happened
@TVdub We certainly need to see more of that, this year has been a troubling one. I really admire and respect you for helping others
@TVdub What made you to decide to also take up charity work?
@TVdub You'll have to visit sometime, it's a terrific place :) I've never been to the US before, but I've always been interested in visiting
@BrenFosterReal Do you think there's a chance we might find out what's become of Australia in the new season?
@TVdub Have you ever been to Australia?

@Bryan_Baruch1 Terrantino?
@Bryan_Baruch1 I was just saying that no matter how it's dressed up, extremism is dangerous and brings nothing but hatred and tragedy
@Bryan_Baruch1 I don't think one can say one group of extremists are worse than another. All types of extremism are dangerous &amp; full of hate
@matthew_mitcham She's a brilliant actress :)

@Bryan_Baruch1 I know you didn't and that it is a fair point - but at the same time we must be careful not to generalise.
@Bryan_Baruch1 As is right-wing extremism. The two are feeding off each other in a very dangerous cycle
@Bryan_Baruch1 It may help some, there r stories of former jihadis who turned their backs on terror. It doesn't happen often, but it can.
@Bryan_Baruch1 I would say all communities need that and I'm not just talking about  Islamic extremists, but the far-right as well.
@Bryan_Baruch1 Hard to say with any certainty, but stricter control laws would make such tragedies less likely to occur.
@Bryan_Baruch1 I'm not, I'm just saying not every Muslim is a fundamentalist and we shouldn't jump to conclusions yet.
@Bryan_Baruch1 I think it was a huge mistake by the FBI not to keep eye on the Orlando attacker
@Bryan_Baruch1 I agree, we must not blame whole groups of people for the actions of an extreme minority
@Bryan_Baruch1 or if he was acting alone
@Bryan_Baruch1 To my knowledge, it's not yet known whether the attacker is a fundamentalist or not, &amp; if he is, whether he's part of a cell
@Bryan_Baruch1 Gun control would minimise the risks of any terrorist, actual &amp; aspiring, from getting their hands on military-grade weapons.
@Bryan_Baruch1 It has been proven that proper education decreases extremism of all kinds
@AlexanderWraith Good advice Alex
@Bryan_Baruch1 I was very upset when I first heard. I couldn't believe there had been another attack in France. Now there's a coup in Turkey
