@ohthatcarols @CarsonSieving @darth @anamariecox That is a power move!

@abnacular @CarsonSieving @darth @anamariecox I just hurt myself laughing! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
@CarsonSieving @darth @anamariecox I do not have a dog video. But I offer up a video of my cat watching a video of herself watching a video of a bird and a squirrel. https://t.co/EyVunCGxKC

@Beatlebaby64 @jallman971 I have asked this question many times and not gotten an answer yet. Maybe you will answer. How is posting screenshots of someone's own words character assassination?

@Jeanie4Parkway A friend of mine told me that she used to know you. She said that you weren't this angry at the world back then. I hope you can find your way back.
@CaseyNolen @Jeanie4Parkway Yep, it's hilarious to call yourself a traitor who fights to own other human beings.
@bradbakker @Jeanie4Parkway And you get a follow
@jallman971 @971FMTalk @AllmanReport @ATeamMom1 So you're posting pictures of minors and attacking them on social media. Lovely.
@Jeanie4Parkway @jibjosh @Koenig4MO @ParkwaySchools I saw those Tweets with my own eyes before you locked your account. No lies were told.
@craigdougscott You say "I appear to have been demotherpated."

@RepLouBarletta Further, it isn't a zero sum game. There is no line. Our society is capable of taking care of multiple people at once. Helping one person doesn't hurt another. You know this.

@Jeanie4Parkway @TuckerCarlson Hi Jeanie, have you published a list of the Parkway groups you're against? Are these groups comprised of teachers, students or parents? I'd like more information.
@guypbenson Respectfully, is $1.50 a week for a teacher really among the top three examples you can find?
@dyllyp She looks so plumpy and delightful! I bet she's a cuddler.
@gidglick This is reasonable.

@LauraJS01092808 @Sticknstones4 @AllmanReport @Jeanie4Parkway @jallman971 I am curious why @Jeanie4Parkway feels compelled to like the off-topic responses to my original question, but so far has not felt compelled to answer that question. Check out @Amym_stl’s Tweet: https://t.co/LVC831rYgQ
@LauraJS01092808 @Sticknstones4 @AllmanReport @Jeanie4Parkway @jallman971 @Jeanie4Parkway has publicly posted that Islam should be banned. She has not denied this nor has she explained it. That is what this thread is about.
@LauraJS01092808 @Sticknstones4 @AllmanReport @Jeanie4Parkway @jallman971 So you believe the logical conclusion to this occurrence is to ban Islam?
@dyllyp What are you going to do when your fake children turn 13?
@megangerberding @CraigElementary This is just so fabulous!!!

@WJJ_SPORTS @ErinRRichards @guardian Assuming Soros is identical, which is debatable, why would that make this any less terrifying?
@ErinRRichards @guardian a) I had a coffee instead &amp; it was wonderful, b) This is an incredible overview of current landscape &amp; c) Holy crap
@sbstewartlaing @ScottWesterfeld But to be clear, I find this statement of yours to be most concise, closest to the whole truth.
@sbstewartlaing @ScottWesterfeld This issue roils in my head nonstop. Relevant @anamariecox podcast yesterday was fascinating &amp; painful.
@sbstewartlaing @ScottWesterfeld OK, so, that doesn't make them pathetic, duped or hateful. Dangerous, yes, and stunningly selfish, yes.
@sbstewartlaing @ScottWesterfeld That's a different depiction altogether, isn't it?
@ScottWesterfeld I am not a Trump supporter by any means. This seems like an awfully wide brush to be painting with. Is it useful?
@FTC9790 @FTC_Indiana Good luck!!!
@djrothkopf It's not a matter of what they know, but of whether they care. They do not.
@jfmailander @EntirelyAmelia @panegron @VP I am curious. Did you have insurance? Were you kicked off your insurance during treatment?
@erugg @LibyaLiberty To be fair, I'm pretty sure they hate most men on the planet, too.
@FoxNews So, still arbitrary, pointless and bigoted, then?
@lsarsour Thank you! This happened in my hometown and I can tell you your help is much appreciated!
@deanbarker Aargh! There are so many kids whose best daily meal comes from school lunch.
@DanaSchwartzzz Oooh, the screeching, glass slicing sound you just made my brain play in my head is terrible!
@nanzm @Trace_Urdan @JATrojans @EduBenM @dcpublicschools Wow, really?? You know ALL of the teachers? That's cool! How did you manage that?
@Trace_Urdan @JATrojans @EduBenM @dcpublicschools I'm not in a union. What? "They're waiting to be told" imples all teachers. No conflation.
@Trace_Urdan @JATrojans @EduBenM @dcpublicschools That is logic 101.
@Trace_Urdan @JATrojans @EduBenM @dcpublicschools Disagree. DeVos implied all teachers in "receive mode." School provided counterexamples.
@Trace_Urdan @JATrojans @EduBenM @dcpublicschools So, another honest question: How should one measure accountability? What actually works?
@Trace_Urdan @JATrojans @EduBenM @dcpublicschools The discussion was about teachers, not unions, so I was honestly asking you to clarify.
@Trace_Urdan @JATrojans @EduBenM @dcpublicschools Are you saying you believe some or all teachers are the enemies of the students?
@Trace_Urdan @JATrojans @EduBenM @dcpublicschools Sec of Ed should be on same side as teachers, not making vague unsubstantiated criticisms

@PKhakpour I think many believe the administrations actions just won't affect them or their families; they will be excluded somehow.
@JeffFlake So you are saying is there is no one who advocates school choice who has any qualifications for being Secretary of Education?
@AHMcDonald @scalzi Look, he skipped St. Louis. Surely that would come before KC! :-P
@Kafkasrecruit @jonlovett @KellyannePolls So sad for them. Either they identify with it and will become it, or they don't and they are hurt.
@scalzi Ugh, St. Louis never gets good stuff. We always have to haul up to Chicago. And you're there on a Wednesday. Sigh.
@jonlovett @KellyannePolls I have kids her kids' ages. I just keep wondering what they go through when they see her lie so blatantly on TV.
@GmanMatt68 @saladinahmed 	“I think that is a matter that’s best left to the states,” when asked whether schools should adhere to IDEA
@saladinahmed Don't forget kids with learning disabilities. She already stated straight-up she doesn't care about them.
@BoingBoing By all accts, not qualified. So a) no voucher advocate is qualified, b) they don't want qualified or c) pay for play is priority
@catvalente I have attached @TheTrackR trackers to everything I own. I can find anything.
@Keffy Sean crossed over to mean, so SNL had to. He's a crabby, yelling person.
@pourmecoffee Dammit. At 3:00 AM this morning, when I awaken screaming with this image in my head, I'm tweeting viciously at you.
@Sam__Weller Not sure if you want to hear Trump's answer to your question.
@danpfeiffer Saturday?
@joe_hill That was beautiful! I have a tear in my eye. At least, I hope it's a tear.
@NPRinskeep @NPR Thank you so much for trying to hold him to actually answering questions today. I was cheering you on in my car!
@mcvalada I apologized to a random Australian last night. She said it was cool &amp; that they don't like their PM. But, still, embarrassing!
@sblackmoore Listing the answer to your question would be the most epic twitterstorm ever, ending only when the sun swallowed the earth.
@3rdplacepress I mean, they are talking like he's a toddler that missed his nap.
@ananavarro Are you caught up with the last 10 min of Trump's tweeting?
@CarolynLake You are the first Australian I found in my feed tonight, so I'll apologize to you personally. Hot damn, that man's embarassing.
@davidhedeen @TVietor08 @jonfavs @jonlovett This. This should happen.
@jeffzeleny @JusticeGorsuch @JusticeHardiman Everyone should just ignore this garbage.
@SallyQYates Thank you for standing up for what is constitutional and what is right.
@catvalente I'm not sure which man you mean, but either way, I agree!
@scalzi Excellent. Just checking!
@scalzi Are... are you a werewolf?
@dyllyp I, a complete stranger, was moved by your story. Thank you!
@Nalo_Hopkinson Thank you for a small delight on an otherwise stressful day! (Now I want to cast random household objects in resin...)
@Keffy He truly, deep down in his soul, where he has never allowed anyone to go, where his innermost being exists, doesn't care.
@Nalo_Hopkinson The red one reminds me somewhat of teeth and can't stop staring at it. I think I love it!
@Nalo_Hopkinson The red one...
@Nalo_Hopkinson This one is fascinating. And disturbing. And fascinating. And disturbing.
@simplehiccup @ScienceMarchSTL @ScienceMarchDC Absolutely!
