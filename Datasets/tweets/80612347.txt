I am confused..as the poverty level is about 25k yet how many actually live on 13k a year..fixed income. The wealthy can spend 13k on trivial interests. In probably a real short time frame..could they imagine the struggle persons endure?
Tax dollars are not a gift to wealthiest Americans. Tax dollars are revenues collected to aid our society where problems exist.
Elderly have lived..have competed on many levels..aging is a difficult process. When pushed to extreme scenerios as homelessness,Americans are not then outraged?
Persons unable to compete in a job market are less important..the need for food..the need to survive is less important?
Although job reports show progress..issues must be addressed.. When you labor only to give your results to housing..where is their opportunity to progress further? Many have been overpriced to homelessness. Where is the outrage?
Its not about empowering more wealth to over entitled persons its about structuring opportunities to progress a work force to enable Americans to pay overpriced rents to attempt to survive, raising children to believe they could withstand the stress of daily life.
