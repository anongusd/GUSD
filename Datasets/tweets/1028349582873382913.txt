@LABreadBoy @AustinLASchools Interesting. I can understand that. But I also think that having a business man is helpful for effective negotiations and budgeting.
@LABreadBoy @AustinLASchools I wasn’t trying to imply that she was fired. My point is that a change of pace and differing from tradition is not necessarily a bad thing. That’s all.
@LABreadBoy @AustinLASchools Why does he need education experience? The previous leadership clearly wasn’t working, so they brought in someone who’s been very successful and worked very hard. Makes perfect sense!
@LABreadBoy @AustinLASchools How is he a hypocrite? He’s simply working hard and doing his best for LA students!

@imthrealwiseguy @TrumpsareNazis @SopanDeb @chrislhayes Furthermore, Antifa and others are rarely targeting actual nazis/neo-nazis. Most people who take issue with Antifa do so because they attack regular right-wing rallies with intimidation and violence. They write off Trump supporters as nazis, then claim they’re fighting nazis.

@KerryPicket @seanmdav @jaketapper As a story develops, new evidence can emerge. Thus @jaketapper ‘s claim could have been true then, and now is not. If he didn’t acknowledge that there is evidence, he wouldn’t have shared this. This tweet isn’t a flip-flop or even him being wrong, it’s just a news development.
RT @chadgoesdeep: @jaketapper What up?
@benshapiro Ben, I’m a huge fan of yours, but you are politicizing this quite soon. After Pittsburgh, from what I remember, you were appalled at how quickly many politicized the tragedy. I think we should afford the victims here the same respect and wait to bring up policy and response.

@Luckymon4 @hbluv2surf @SugrDady @FeeVert @jaketapper @ChrisCPandolfo How does this help your cause or improve anything whatsoever? Rude and shameful.
@Bossanova98 @benshapiro That is heartless to politicize this so quickly without even any regard for how Ben and others are feeling right now. You should rethink your shameless commitment to politics and political agenda.
@bbmoody1 @ldpoggi @BarbaraComstock How can you possibly deduce that?
@ldpoggi @BarbaraComstock Go Barbara! #redwave
@Jspacehelmet @nhinojosaa @BarbaraComstock That seems unnecessary.
@johnizonline @ldpoggi @BarbaraComstock There was no mention of Trump in this tweet, only Barbara Comstock and what she has done in Congress defending our constitutional rights.
@ldpoggi @BarbaraComstock Good Boys for Comstock!
@SomalianFacts @ldpoggi @BarbaraComstock @nhinojosaa @dumpcomstock Barbara Comstock is a white supremacist? How do you know that? Or do you just spew whatever nonsense the Dems feed you?
