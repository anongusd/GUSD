@scharlie8408 @SenTedCruz @KXAN_News And you can‚Äôt prove one not even one of the suppose it miracles of Jesus or any miracle stated in your book of mythology. But scientists can prove science. What is the mechanism that Jesus used To turn water into wine?

@scharlie8408 @SenTedCruz @KXAN_News As soon as you can prove any aspect of creationism I‚Äôll let you teach it in school. Evolution has already been proved.

@scharlie8408 @SenTedCruz @KXAN_News Hey science that‚Äôs inconvenient to your believe system is a mythology. You have yet to prove any of Jesus‚Äôs supposedly miracles. Prove one under the scientific method and I‚Äôll believe. Prove one. Show the mechanism for turning water into wine.
@scharlie8408 @SenTedCruz @KXAN_News Teaching any religious mythology in public school  is unacceptable to me. If you want to teach religious mythology teach it in your own home or your church I support that. I don‚Äôt support any taxpayer Support for any religious instruction.
@SpeakerPelosi @SenateGOP The shut down is showing how corrupt Americas two party system is thank you Nancy.
@scharlie8408 @SenTedCruz @KXAN_News I believe you have the right to believe in whatever religious nonsense you want to believe in.

@scharlie8408 @SenTedCruz @KXAN_News Actually I believe in the Constitution you are the one that does not believe in the Constitution you think you own your wife and children you do not. I wouldn‚Äôt be a bit surprised if you believe in slavery.
@scharlie8408 @SenTedCruz @KXAN_News I Suppose you think your own your wife to? You don‚Äôt own your children they own themselves. One of the many problems with Christianity that it tells you that you own your children and your wife. You don‚Äôt. At least not in this country.
@scharlie8408 @SenTedCruz @KXAN_News Christianity does not belong in public education anymore than Satanism does or any religious mythology. The taxpayers should not pay for religious mythology instruction.
@common @AOC One of the biggest problems with America is the belief in the cultural mythology of America. One thing that would help is replacing the reciting of the Pledge of Allegiance with the reciting of the bill of rights.

@marcorubio I know you‚Äôre absolutely a brilliant genius but please explain how a wall will fix the corrupt regime‚Äôs of Central America? How will the wall give Mexicans and Central Americans economic opportunity and freedom?
@SenTedCruz @SenSchumer TBB when did you ever get a clear mandate to build the wall? The popular vote in the 2016 election did not go to Donald Trump. The 2018 election did not go to the Republicans. Over 50% of the electorate did not vote. There is no mandate for the wall.
@SenSanders @realDonaldTrump What I see is a corrupt two party system that cannot govern. Time for a third-party.
@VP @POTUS Tell the American people are the employment opportunities in the bill slave labor? Will minimum wage and prevailing wage laws apply? If not then it is slave labor which is unconstitutional.
@realDonaldTrump The employment opportunities provision sounds like slave labor to me.
@realDonaldTrump The concept of building the wall is dinosaur thinking. It is treating the symptom not the problem. Economic investment in Central America that benefits the people is what It‚Äôs to be done.
@senatemajldr Treat the cause of the illegal immigration from Central America not the symptoms. Economic investment in central America that benefits the people will stop illegal immigration. Supporting the despotic regimes of Central America won‚Äôt stop illegal immigration.
@stucam7771 Why do Americans vote for the corrupt two parties of the corrupt two party system decade after decade? Congressional approval rating is under 22%, and yet people still vote for Republicans and Democrats. Why? Why when they don‚Äôt deliver on their promises?
@Ocasio2018 $5.7 billion in economic investments for the people in Central America would end the need for immigration into the United States from Central America.
@SenSchumer @senatemajldr Bernie would have won.
@CNN @LindseyGrahamSC What‚Äôs the military Objective? How do you define victory in Afghanistan? What‚Äôs the exit strategy? Our military is not designed for nation building. Our military is designed to destroy a nation‚Äôs ability to resist.
@FAIRImmigration @JimInhofe @LifeZette @ConnorInTheNews Building a wall that will not stop illegal immigration is it attempt to treat the symptom not the problem. Treating the symptom never here‚Äôs the problem. The problem is corrupt regime‚Äôs in Central America.
@marcorubio Treating the symptom instead of the problem never works.
@marcorubio Rubio your policies are stuck in the past. Trying to maintain alliances that are destined to dissolve is stupid. We have to forge new alliances. Economic and political union with central American states, Mexico and Canada only way were going to survive.
@Kj38542413 @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Donald Trump has done more in the last two years to destroy the two party system then I could do in 10 years. 71% of millennial‚Äôs want a third-party. 60% of the general population wants a third party.

@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Light Sack the wall is a sign of weakness not strength.

@morgana_SSS @AynRandPaulRyan So they‚Äôll cut funding that goes to get there legislation passed and to reelect congressmen who get there legislation https://t.co/GswpYmByWG if they don‚Äôt give Nancy the chairmanship they‚Äôll give up 50% of their control over the Democratic Party.
@morgana_SSS @AynRandPaulRyan I just read this news article. Read this and I think we should analyze. Let‚Äôs think about what these big-money donors are saying. If the house doesn‚Äôt vote Nancy as speaker they will Cut funding by 50%.
@morgana_SSS @AynRandPaulRyan Thank you for the debate it‚Äôs been fun.
@morgana_SSS @AynRandPaulRyan OK we‚Äôll go with Barbra we can agree on that.
@morgana_SSS @AynRandPaulRyan Well I have to admit your reading skills are superb.What about nominating Norma Torres she‚Äôs a Hispanic she‚Äôs a woman and she has experience and I believe her heart is in the right place, what about Barbara Lee a female and an African-American. Either one would be historic.
@morgana_SSS @AynRandPaulRyan Yes you are correct I said that there are a host of reasons I don‚Äôt want to support her. I said I would support her though if she came out with an ironclad guarantee to start impeachment hearings on day one of her new chairmanship.

@morgana_SSS @AynRandPaulRyan The process starts in the house of representatives with impeachment. If she doesn‚Äôt at least try to do that I do not support her. And if she said that she was going to start impeachment hearings on the first day of her new chairmanship I would support her.
@SenJoniErnst Stop selling arms to a murderous tyrant.
@morgana_SSS @AynRandPaulRyan Yes, the Trump administration is the most dangerous administration to the foundations of the republic that has never been elected.

@AynRandPaulRyan The only way I‚Äôd support Nancy Pelosi is if she gave a ironclad guarantee along with the rest of the DNC to impeach and remove Donald Trump from office. But that‚Äôs impossible because there was only a blue ripple they did not take over the Senate. She is a failure at leadership.

@SenSchumer Hypocrite, you had a bullet proof Congress when Obama was elected. You and the other members of the DNC could‚Äôve given the American people Medicare for all and you didn‚Äôt. You are owned lock stock and barrel by Wall Street.

@EndDeportations @NancyPelosi üëéüì°
@NancyPelosi Just like the open and trans parent way you and the rest of the DNC cheated Bernie Sanders out of the nomination?
@SenSanders Introduce legislation that will prevent any company from having federal contract that does not pay it‚Äôs employees a living wage. If they‚Äôre employees are On food stamps they shouldn‚Äôt be getting a federal contract. The taxpayers should not be subsidizing the Waltons.
@RepMcKinley Introduce legislation that will fund research into the development of technology that will harness the energy from the excessive heat in the oceans caused by global warming.
@TrueLoveX5 @SenSanders Then you haven‚Äôt looked. I just tweeted Schumer he should resign and help clean up the corruption in the DNC.
@RepKarenBass @cowboytexas Sticking with the status quo of Corruption at the DNC.
@SenSchumer Resign and help clean up the DNC.
@TrueLoveX5 @SenSanders Because I believe the political system of the United States was founded by people who were corrupt and that the political system of the United States has always been corrupt and that the political system is still corrupt I‚Äôm not supposed to care about that corruption?
@NancyPelosi You are a part of the culture of corruption in the two-party system. We have Donald Trump as president because you and the rest of the DNC cheated Bernie out of the nomination in 2016. The evil that results from the Donald Trump presidency is the results of your corruption.
@TrueLoveX5 @SenSanders Why do you continue to believe in the cultural mythology of America?

@TrueLoveX5 @SenSanders It was. It‚Äôs always been corrupted. The founding fathers were the 1percent of their time.
@SenSanders The corrupt two party system gave us Donald Trump. The corrupt two party system denied the American people from having you as president. All the evil that comes from that Donald Trump presidency is laid at the feet of the corrupt two party system.
@100_Disable_vet No, but Nazi Journalists were put on trial for war crimes at Nuremberg for beating the drum of war. Hamady should be put on trial for beating the war drums during the run up to the Iraq war.
@SenSanders A 75% asset tax against the Waltons and the other billionaires of America would fix that.
@realDonaldTrump Amnesty all nonviolent drug offenders. End the war on drugs. Decriminalize all drug use.That would go along way to reform the criminal justice system.
@JStein_WaPo @SenSanders How about introducing legislation that will ban any company from having government contracts who‚Äôs employees are on food stamps because they don‚Äôt pay their employees A living wage.
@Goss30Goss How many state houses and state legislatures went republican under her leadership? That‚Äôs the kind of leader ship you want to put back into power? It‚Äôs time for the Old Nancy to go to the Rockingchair porch.

@FoxNews Donald Trump is an incompetent fool.
@RealDonad_Trump You launder money for Russian oligarchs that‚Äôs a crime idiot.
@realDonaldTrump The Democratic Party is not the real left. The democratic party is owned by Wall Street just like you.
@realDonaldTrump @MariaBartiromo @FoxNews You mean you‚Äôre going to have your ego masturbated so you can feel like a man.
@realDonaldTrump What we need is a confident Chief executive and commander in chief. You certainly aren‚Äôt up to the task Donald Trump. And I don‚Äôt think Mike is either. But you‚Äôre just an aberration in history. And soon your presidency will be history
@realDonaldTrump Just had a conversation with a vegetable farmer. He can‚Äôt get enough labor to work in his field‚Äôs. He would be employing three times the amount of people buying from our economy. They‚Äôre afraid to come work for him because of you.
@realDonaldTrump Idiot yes I‚Äôm talking to you Donald Trump. The North Koreans are still enriching uranium and you canceled the Military readiness exercises with South Korea.. You are exactly what general Kelly said you are you‚Äôre an Idiot.
@RealDonad_Trump Douche bag Donald Trump the North Koreans are still enriching uranium you damn fool. You canceled the Wargames and got nothing for it you damn fool.
@JKSuicideWatch Cancel the word games and they‚Äôre still Enriching uranium. You‚Äôre a failure general.

@FoxNews @POTUS Largest national debt ever. Deficit spending on track to be over $2, trillion and 2018
@SpeakerRyan Largest national debt ever. More and more of your tax dollars going to pay the principal and interest on the ever increasing republican debt.
@charliekirk11 How many bombs are being dropped by Venezuelan drones on the Middle East? How many men women and children have been blown to bits by Venezuelan bombs? How many Unarmed Palestinians of the Venezuelans shot down?
@VP The United States has 325 million people Asia has 4 billion people even you Mr. Vice President should see that they have a much larger pool of labor to draw from. We need the central American people. We need the Mexican people.
@JKSuicideWatch Do you need a crowdfunding site for your bass boat?
@realDonaldTrump The oval office is open for Russian corruption.
@SpeakerRyan How many robots vote?
@SpeakerRyan @RepBuddyCarter They deserve a commander in chief it isn‚Äôt a draft dodger.

@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends @AmyKremer Just a matter of time before special prosecutor comes for you.
@realDonaldTrump The leakers.
@ValKHeadley @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump All supreme courts are by definition Constitutional courts. Plessy versus Ferguson was the constitutional court.
@realDonaldTrump @SenJohnHoeven @RepKevinCramer Look what your trade war Donald Trump is doing to the Dow.
@cathymcmorris Bring our troops home from the unwinnable war the United States is now in.
@ValKHeadley @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump What?
@VP How are all the Olympic venues that the Brazilians paid for? Are the people getting to enjoy all that?
@BudgetGOP @SpeakerRyan @SenatorEnzi Will that work out for Alec?
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Bernie would‚Äôve won and we wouldn‚Äôt be in this position today. The corruption at the DNC is the reason United States of America is going to have an extremely right-wing supreme court.
@jmartNYT @angeil Vote third-party
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse You always sit forward like you cannot get comfortable like you‚Äôre ready to run at a moments notice.

@SpeakerRyan @HASCRepublicans If you idiot Republicans don‚Äôt understand that war games are critical to readiness then you‚Äôre completely clueless.
@SenTedCruz @FoxNews @SenMikeLee Donald Trump‚Äôs trade war did wonders for the stock market today.
@realDonaldTrump Look what your trade wars doing to the stock market.
@realDonaldTrump Your trade war has made the stock market fall again.
@SpeakerRyan Do United States military isn‚Äôt hollowed out you idiot. Canceling the word games with South Korea is a stupid move. Different movies working together need to practice so they don‚Äôt run into each other. Same is true of Air Force .
@VP @POTUS You work for an idiot, religious fanatic.
@JKSuicideWatch How after all the years of your service does it add up working for a draft dodger? Show me the math that makes that work.
@realDonaldTrump The house Republicans should impeach the worst president ever. That would be you Donald Trump.
@realDonaldTrump One day All other presidents will be judged by the standard of Donald Trump. For all time Donald Trump will be considered the worst president of the United States has ever had.
@VP @USCitsBrazil @SecondLady Brazil is overseas?
@VP @USCitsBrazil @SecondLady The Trump administration is a symptom of the corrupt two party political system of the United States.

@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @KingAbdullahII @QueenRania Is your wife a free woman? Can she and her son leave the White House and never come back? Did you make her sign a prenup that you‚Äôll take her son away from her if she leaves you? Are you holding her under duress?
@realDonaldTrump The leakers have leaked all the information That the special prosecutor needs to prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law.
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @KingAbdullahII @QueenRania Is your Wife free to go can she leave the White House and never come back if she wants to? Will you come out publicly and say that she can leave with her son anytime she wants and never come back if that‚Äôs what she decides.

@RealDonad_Trump Why don‚Äôt you and Maxine sit down and take an IQ test together. I bet that Maxine will wipe the floor with you. And if you don‚Äôt think so ask general Kelly he thinks you‚Äôre an idiot. I agree with general Kelly on that I think you‚Äôre an idiot.
@realDonaldTrump The federal government is on track to borrow over $2 trillion this year. Putting the United States national debt $2 trillion deeper. That more your tax dollars paying principal and interest.
