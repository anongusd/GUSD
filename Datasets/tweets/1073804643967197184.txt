@RepMattGaetz Just because an illegal wants to buy a gun makes him or her more dangerous to society???? Plz. USA is the mother of psychopaths.  At the end is government fault making  guns legal.
@RepMattGaetz Nobody is illegal in a stolen land.
@techiedad @SteveScalise Well said.

@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Stop talking  bad about Mexico. It is a beautiful Country.  Everyone in USA is illegal  including YOU.  USA is MADE of Illegals. Ask a native american. It would be interesting what they have to say about it.    I am a Mexican by the way  I don't allow you to speak bad about Mexi.
@edodonnell8 @DeichgrafHauke @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Thankyou Sr.
@jodilyn96789228 @melshy09 @realDonaldTrump This country is made of illegals. Ask an Native American
@SteveScalise I am sick of all this bullshit about illegals. They are human being too. Regardless legal status,  skin color. Etc.. this country was made of Illegals.
@TreasonMaybe @SteveScalise Exactly.
@NJParaUnityExpo @chipcoffey @amyallantdf I would like  a reading with Amy  Allan someday.

@SteveKingIA If only the native Americans had a wall back then.  ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump I am lost here. Can someone tell me please what is going on??? Because all a see  is arrogance from government people.
That's right. https://t.co/v5vQeHm2qK
@tafkam08 @SteveKingIA @realDonaldTrump Exactly!!! What is he talking  about when his ancestors are illegal too. Nobody invited them to America . They took the land killing those poor natives American.
@Jim_Jordan A wall is not going to stop illegals,  drugs, criminals etc. simply because the  majority of illegals, drugs  etc. Gets inside the country through via  aerial,  people with legal status  etc. Or don't tell the 9 11 terrorists   came  from the border  from Mexico's border.
Nice to be back.
