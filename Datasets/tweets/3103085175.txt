@marcorubio Are you referring to trump?	I hope you are not defending him or protecting him. We all see what is  happening to Cohen. Don the Destroyer had choice words about you and your family. Yet...it seems you are defending him. Why?
@EdKrassen I will believe it when I see it. Teflon Don should be called Don the Destroyer.
@mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 A Twitter threat is still a threat. GO TO JAIL. You can be in the cell next to Cohen. I need to ask you &amp; @GOP , in the end, do you think protecting trump will be worth it?  Republicans should try protecting America from trump.
@GOP trump instructed him to do so. I'm not defending Cohen &amp; GOP should NOT be defending trump. trump is a destroyer &amp; I fear the GOP is one of his victims, just like MC.
