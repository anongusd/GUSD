@Dashon_Kizer Bayard helped King combat all of that or he would’ve DIED. You hear me? I’m sure King wanted to box, but to be someone shunned from your own community to give the time to help someone, A PASTOR, who don’t even like you or your life style is THE DEFINITION OF A SERVANT.

@MrUnpopuIar Exactly lol 		I’m saying that you can get hours for Broccoli City AND Afropunk. One doesn’t cancel the other. 		You have to have two accounts, you can’t transfer hours.
@MrUnpopuIar 1) Even to do that, you would have to create a whole other account. You can’t use chips for other things if you’re already signed in for one event.		2) Chipn is legit, you just have to be willing to work.. but yea clearly... 🙂

@TinaVBryant @ashthewriter I agree. Sadly, some people just don’t have those standards for their own family’s and children... as we can see.
@ashthewriter @TinaVBryant Sparkle said it “I saw that drive in her...”		At what cost was she willing to succeed? —or was this the family pushing her?
@ashthewriter @TinaVBryant There just comes a time when enough is enough. Like she said, you can’t just hand your child over to anyone, but then again... What was their motive? Did she vocalize what was really going on? Was the family pressed for money? Or was she working alone and never let on?		Facets.
@ashthewriter @TinaVBryant Money has always been a pressing point for the black community..and we all have different vices and limits that we will press to get it.		Some people are really just bad parents. —Not intentionally. They just are. They clearly valued money over the security of their child’s soul.
In my humble opinion, too many men flirt for you to even get to THE ROOT of the business you’re trying to conduct. Gay men are clearly not interested in you. Full stop.		SOME women are catty and competitive, but between my discernment and Jesus.. I’ve been sent the right people.
