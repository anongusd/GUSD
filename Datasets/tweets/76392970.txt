@KipTalleyDC We're sorry you feel that way. We disagree that the government is entitled to our business's product (or any business’ products) for free. If you change your mind and would like to join many other offices and staffers who have purchased subscriptions, please reach out.
@KipTalleyDC Also, that $125/mo. is for access to the full office and provides our full suite of services. That’s a HUGE discount from our normal prices. 1 seat of more limited services normally costs that to public. We also have individual staff subscriptions now starting at $2.95 per month
@KipTalleyDC If congressional staff want to see info we have on them, we offer that free. Go to your page, register for free with us and click on the Claim This Page link. You can see what info we have and suggest changes. So we only charge to see info on others, plus our other services
@KipTalleyDC You price is high. it is $125 per month. But we have several competitors that charge far more than us and always have. Are you also complaining about them?

@Ami_Marisol @ProDylanRoberts @politico That's two thumbs up for @JeanneShaheen and @SenatorCantwell
Our House data also shows female over-representation. 4 in 10 House #worstbosses are female, including @JacksonLeeTX18 @RepKayGranger @RepKarenBass @RepEsty. Yet only 1 in 5 House members are female. Not as bad as the 7 in 10 for Senate but any ideas why this might be? https://t.co/kYotK1xe1m

Definitely not always. But our calculation methodology eliminates many possibly artifacts in the data. And in most cases, it seems to jibe with anecdotal data. For example, the fact that @JacksonLeeTX18 is tough to work for has been documented extensively. https://t.co/ZOkgLsTCmm

Great profile: "acclaimed finder of missing stamps and governors." In case you wondered, our data would only count you turning over once if you left and came back and left again. We tried hard to separate true turnover from the regular dynamics of a fluid workplace. https://t.co/gbSXs3fcG1
@connectwithww @LegBranch One more key point: Staff often depart a personal office for a subcommittee or committee. That's usually good for the staffer, not bad. So we don't count that kind of turnover if they are working for their boss on the committee.
@connectwithww @LegBranch And to eliminate other artifacts, we eliminated interns and temporary staff. We also took into account that staff move to campaigns or go on leave and come back. If a staffer ever comes back, we do not count them leaving in the first place as turnover.
@connectwithww @LegBranch We also looked at all the churn that happened during the year, not just comparing start and end points. e.g. if a $100K staffer leaves to be replaced by another and then yet another, that double-turnover would count twice as much toward the office turnover numbers.
@connectwithww @LegBranch Excellent question. We don't know @LegBranch methodology exactly but we tried to be very robust in our data handling. Most importantly, we used a salary-weighted model. A $100K/yr staffer leaving counts twice as much as a $50K/yr staffer.

@joshmccrain We'll modify the documentation. Did we send you the web version? We have recently implemented a major improvement in documentation.
@joshmccrain Good point. We'll add that to our data too.
@joshmccrain The preferred alias business is also true for staffers. Someone named Peter Charles Smith Jr might go by Charlie Smith in normal settings.
@joshmccrain It's always best to match using IDs if you have those in the other data sets. For example, the bioguide_id is one common standard
@joshmccrain Core_person_aliases lists all other versions of the name they have gone by. The is_preferred flag tags the one that is "conventional"
@joshmccrain Our core_person names policy is to show the most complete, formal name for the person.  So if we know obscure middle names, they go in there
@joshmccrain You might be looking in the wrong place for "conventional" names of members. It's in the core_person_alias table with the is_preferred flag
