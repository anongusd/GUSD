Democrats claiming there’s no crisis at the border. Remember when they said it would take weeks or months for the migrant caravan to trek across Mexico — but they just took buses?
As a fiscal conservative, constitutionalist, and strong advocate for the military, I believe the need is clear and pressing, the law supports immediate action, and ample funding exists to address this crisis.
Under legal authority Congress has granted the executive, which Barack Obama also used to combat Mexican cartels, the President has the power to declare a national emergency, in order to fund the construction of new border barriers at dangerous weak points.
...and years of congressional inaction. 		Unfortunately, Congress has largely abdicated its responsibility, placing the onus on President Trump to fulfill the federal government’s most important constitutional duty: national security.
These forces are destabilizing and deadly to people on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border, but particularly for the less fortunate among us. While wealthy elites erect walls for protection, poor and working-class citizens must live with the consequences of insecure borders...
...not including victims of MS-13 and other violent gangs, which have infiltrated recent migrant caravans. However, the equivalent of a migrant caravan enters our country almost weekly.
Constituents in my district are suffering from the opioid epidemic. Mexican cartels produce or distribute most heroin, fentanyl, cocaine, and methamphetamine here, killing tens of thousands of Americans every year...
They partner with foreign adversaries, including Cuba, Venezuela, Iran and China, and smuggle drugs as well as human beings into our neighborhoods, including in my home state of Tennessee.
Sophisticated international cartels, some of the most dangerous criminal and terrorist organizations in the world, are operating just across the border from the United States in Mexico.

During weak Obama economic “recovery” admin officials frequently repeated idea U.S. could never again achieve normal growth. "Secular stagnation” they called it... but now Barack Obama taking credit for great numbers they said could never happen!
Hearing from Big Gov liberals "inflation is a hidden tax." They're for HIGHER TAXES! 		Wages rising beyond inflation. And "total compensation" includes more than wages. Bonuses. Benefits. 		Let's not forget all those simply finding new jobs. Tax cuts mean more after-tax income! https://t.co/6wSU48NRA3
Republican policies are creating energy jobs and U.S. oil and gas dominance, an economic and national security asset. Democrats' destructive plan would punish taxpayers, ratepayers, and businesses, and put our country at the mercy of 	foreign adversaries... like Russia. #Winning https://t.co/G47FJLSwsl

TN lowest unemployment #’s since DOL kept track. 2 pt drop in one year.  Wages rising in tighter market. Let’s keep up the good work!
Obama Admin never enforced ind O’care mandate. Many pay fine rather than buy overpriced plans.   Repeal it and give ppl a tax cut instead.

Small biz rewards in GOP tax plans quite frankly AMAZING. Minuscule rate on first 75k. Very low 25% thereafter. Immediate expensing.
Dems attacking successful ppl have low expectations for hardworking Americans. GOP tax cuts will help more advance in dynamic economy.
1/2 of taxpayers pay about 97% of fed income tax. Clearly cuts more directly affect them - but bulk will go to those near median income!
Time we recognize: big govt liberals don’t want tax cuts for anyone! Middle class or otherwise. Agenda is higher taxes for higher spending.

Taxes and regs drive business and jobs overseas. What's lib answer? More taxes and regs. Railing against "corporations." No way to grow economy.
Famous Barack small biz quote: "You didn't build that." Wrong! You DID build that. And deserve to keep more of your earnings.
Tax reform opponents demonize small biz &amp; companies employing Americans. Which provide goods &amp; services we enjoy! Neg attitude explains poor Obama econ record.

Instead of taking law abiding American's 2nd Amendment rights we should be focusing on preventing ISIS from radicalizing lone-wolf attackers
Islamic terrorism is real and it is beyond time we started treating it as such. Muslims across the U.S need to disavow radical Islam!
I am deeply sadden by today's terrorist attack in Orlando.  My prayers go out to all the families and those affected by this tragedy.
