I am closely monitoring the tragic situation at the Tree of Life Congregation Synagogue in Pittsburgh. Hateful rhetoric and acts of violence in a synagogue‚Äîor any other peaceful house of worship‚Äîis the epitome of evil. An attack on the Jewish faith community is an attack on all.
I have full confidence that law enforcement will apprehend those responsible for this despicable operation. The perpetrators of these acts will be held accountable. We must stand together against those who seek to divide us through evil, as violence has no place in our society.
These actions are appalling and a setback to civil political discourse. Terrorism is a tool of the weak and must be universally condemned by all Americans, regardless of political persuasion.
