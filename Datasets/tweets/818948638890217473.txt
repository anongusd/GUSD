I call on @SpeakerPelosi today to quickly and immediately bring a comprehensive border security package before the House for a vote. The safety of American citizens is not, and should not be, a partisan issue. #BuildTheWall
As Speaker, Nancy Pelosi has an obligation to Congress &amp; the American people to come to the table and negotiate with @realDonaldTrump. Trump‚Äôs decision today was a deal made in good faith &amp; shows he takes our national security seriously. Now @SpeakerPelosi must do the same.

Today's supplemental disaster funding bill is just another example of House Democrats using disaster victims as political pawns. This bill is not a serious attempt to help those who were devastated by #HurricaneMichael or other disasters across the country.
The Medical Cannabis Research Act, which I introduced today, will make a tremendous difference to researchers nationwide, who may finally be able to develop cures for illnesses that affect many of America‚Äôs most vulnerable populations‚Äîveterans, the chronically ill, &amp; the elderly.

In my district, farmers &amp; manufacturers are concerned about NAFTA &amp; how that impacts trade...the wall, precisely, won't impair trade. We need @POTUS' far better negotiated trade arrangement so Mexico can't cheat &amp; dump cheap agricultural products that hurt our country's farmers.
TPS folks are some of the most hardworking ppl in this country. We could benefit economically by solving the TPS problem. The Bridge Act provides no amnesty &amp; no path to citizenship. It is simply a work extension so ppl can continue to contribute to the great American experience.

Behavior like this damages the integrity of Florida‚Äôs elections, which is our fundamental right as Floridians and as Americans. The bipartisan, Senate-confirmed Secretary of State should place the office in receivership and take over. Enough is enough. #FloridaRecount2018
I call on @FLGovScott to immediately suspend #BrendaSnipes. She has failed to follow state transparency laws during this election, and has a long history of misconduct, including preemptively destroying ballots.
What concerns Republicans is not the law that would require an automatic machine recount in the governor race or a hand recount in the senate race... it's the fact that in Broward county we've now had over 80,000 ballots literally spoken into existence.... https://t.co/Yj2iqy219y

For a party that is willing to cry wolf over voter suppression in every election they lose, Democrats have no problem relying on fraudulent ballots to do the heavy lifting for candidates. I will no longer sit idly by &amp; watch corruption of this magnitude occur. #FloridaRecount2018
It's absurd that since election night 80,000 ballots have been spoken into existence in the two most blue counties. This malfeasance erodes the faith that undergirds our democratic system &amp; after 18 years Florida should have been better equipped to avoid this. #FloridaRecount2018

Dems want to raise the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 27%, which would give the U.S. a higher rate than most developed countries. @HouseGOP &amp; @POTUS lowered the rate to 21%, which accelerated economic growth, increased jobs, &amp; gave Americans the highest wage increase in years.

I commend @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs decision to reimpose tough sanctions on Iran ‚Äî a nation that destabilizes the Middle East, oppresses its own people, and exploits the global financial system to promote ruthless regimes and spread terror worldwide. #IranDeal
Sanctions against Iran were working, which made Obama‚Äôs decision to lift them &amp; agree to the #JCPOA even more misguided. From the beginning, the #IranDeal was a flawed deal that should have never been made. It never served the best interests of the American people or our allies.
President Trump‚Äôs decision to withdraw from #IranDeal shows that he is serious about protecting the American people. I'm proud to stand with Trump as he brings pressure on the Iranian regime to achieve an agreement that denies Iran any path toward developing nuclear weapons.

With the greatest reduction in entitlement spending in decades, the FY2019 GOP Budget - voted on last night in the Budget Cmte - helps put an end to the generational theft of unbalanced budgets &amp; borrowed foreign money, &amp; helps keep the American dream alive for future generations
This budget is a strong statement of conservative principles: it fully funds our military, ensures the social safety net for America‚Äôs most vulnerable citizens is kept intact, and reduces our national debt by eight trillion dollars.
I was proud to vote in favor of the FY19 Republican budget developed by the House Budget Committee. This budget cuts spending by three hundred billion dollars, slashes government waste, and goes beyond balancing to a budget surplus within the budget window.

In America, we need to the #FBI and #DOJ to conduct investigations, analyze factual data, and prosecute real criminals. From the #IGReport, that effort appears to have been undermined by a desire to make the FBI look better to the public following a litany of scandals.
Chapter 8 of #IGReport identifies the ‚Äú@FBI Office of Public Affairs Research Project.‚Äù This was an entire operation within the FBI to influence public opinion. Employees were asked to categorize news reports, leak information to reporters &amp; influence press coverage of the FBI.
It is clear from the #IGReport that James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Lisa Page, Peter Strzok, and other unidentified persons involved with the Clinton and Trump investigations played by their own rules. Justice has suffered and now we need accountability.

On May 1, Rosenstein said ‚Äúthere is actually not a constitutional basis for oversight.‚Äù We on the Judiciary Cmte disagree. From refusing to produce documents, to improperly redacting, to threatening our staff, it is clear that Rosenstein will use every tool to frustrate oversight
The #DOJ‚Äôs intimidation &amp; stone-walling tactics have gone too far. I‚Äôve heard first-hand from congressional staff following threats delivered Deputy AG #Rosenstein. Staff has literally been scared to the point of physically shaking in my office out of concern for their family.

The Comprehensive Opioid Recovery Centers Act creates yet another bloated government spending program. Congress instead should be looking at solutions that enable patients to find alternative treatments that don‚Äôt create dependence and instead focus on patient care. #opioidcrisis
The Comprehensive Opioid Recovery Centers Act is yet another example of a misguided attempt from Washington to fix the growing #OpioidCrisis with a big-government solution. Too many prescriptions written for opioids in America are causing addiction that lead to senseless deaths.

And it‚Äôs that hypocrisy that warrants changes to be made at the very top of the Department of Justice. I understand the President‚Äôs frustration, and believe there is a sufficient basis for firing Rod Rosenstein, as well as the Attorney General for not doing his job.
I find it extremely hypocritical for Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to oversee an investigation into obstruction of justice regarding the firing of former FBI Director James Comey, when Rosenstein wrote the memo recommending Comey's firing himself.
The Department of Justice is currently covering their own trail because they know they engaged in FISA abuses that they don't want to be prosecuted for.

But within the top echelons of the FBI, deep and pervasive corruption has been revealed, and must be weeded out. Corruption must be exposed to sunlight, the best disinfectant, to guard against any further politicization of America‚Äôs premiere law enforcement agency.
In June of 2017, the Justice Department asked the FBI to turn over all of Mr. McCabe‚Äôs correspondence to the watchdog group Judicial Watch; so far, none of this correspondence has been made available.
It is concerning that Mr. McCabe was allowed to stay at the FBI as long as he did. It is also concerning that the FBI has continued to drag its feet on turning over documents to the House Judiciary Committee, and other groups who have requested FBI documents through FOIA requests
Attorney General Sessions‚Äô decision to fire Andrew McCabe was wholly justified, and based on recommendations by the Office of the Inspector General, the FBI‚Äôs Office of Professional Responsibility, and senior career officials at the FBI, all of whom recommended his termination.

I am glad this valuable legislation has passed the House, and hope that the Senate will act quickly to protect America‚Äôs disabled population.
The common-sense policies included in the ADA Education and Reform Act of 2017 will help provide greater access to public accommodations for disabled Americans, and will allow business owners to focus on fixing their properties, not defending themselves against endless disputes.
These lawyers have harmed the disabled community and business owners across America. In 2016 alone, there was a 37% increase in the number of ADA Title III lawsuits filed in federal court compared to the previous year.
Business owners will have the chance to make their properties ADA-compliant, without being dragged into time-consuming and expensive lawsuits. It is sad that so many unscrupulous lawyers have routinely abused the ADA for their own gain.
The ADA Education and Reform Act of 2017 is a victory for the disabled community and for business owners alike. Disabled Americans will be able to have non-ADA-compliant properties remedied swiftly, without incurring the high costs and lengthy wait times of litigation.

The Bipartisan Budget Act brings America close to the edge of a fiscal cliff, burying future generations under a mountain of debt from which we will never be able to escape. We cannot continue borrowing from foreign governments in order to pay for Washington‚Äôs spending addiction.
The most important job of Congress is to provide for the common defense of the United States. But threats to the U.S. are not limited to foreign foes ‚Äî trillion-dollar annual deficits, coupled with our existing twenty-trillion-dollar national debt, threaten America as well.

Not only did the Memo lay bare a systemic pattern of abuse within the FBI &amp; DOJ, it confirmed my worst fear: America‚Äôs free &amp; fair elections were being threatened from within. Our own DOJ worked to tip the scales of justice in order to benefit one political candidate. #MemoDay
Sixty-four other Congressmen joined my letter and my fight to release the memo. Our calls for transparency were met with opposition from Democrats, from the Justice Department, and from FBI leadership. Today, with the release of the memo, our hard work came to fruition. #MemoDay
I call on every American citizen to read this memo, not with preconceived partisan rancor, but with clear eyes and open minds. We must work together to ensure these atrocities included in the FISA Memo never happen again. #MemoDay
For FISA surveillance to be used for partisan political gamesmanship is an assault on democracy. The DOJ, FBI spied on Americans associated w/ Trump campaign based on unverified claims made in a dossier paid for by the Clinton &amp; the DNC. This is repugnant on every possible level.
The released ‚ÄúFISA memo‚Äù from the Intel Committee should cause all American citizens to be outraged, regardless of political affiliation. Truth, justice, and transparency are not partisan concepts ‚Äî they are pillars of the American government. #ReleaseTheMemo
I am hopeful that the release of the FISA memo will create a bipartisan opportunity to evaluate the surveillance protocols and oversight to ultimately stop this type of abuse from happening in the future. https://t.co/IWDy4upnGN
