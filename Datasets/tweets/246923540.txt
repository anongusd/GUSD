5. That would have been great in this role, but I look forward to seeing Zoe's performance &amp; the extent to which she was able to embody Nina
4. Clearly, there's a need for more debate/awareness around casting and it begins w films like this. I can think of several Black actresses
3. As a Hispanic of mixed heritage,I was reminded how beautiful it is to see a fellow Latina on screen:debate re Zoe in the role is healthy
2. I have yet to read confirmation that Zoe Saldana did don dark makeup/fake nose but on seeing the poster I saw a beautiful Afro Latina
1. Appreciate everyone who reminded me that Zoe Saldana likely wore dark skin makeup &amp; wore prosthetic nose as Nina Simone in new biopic

America Ferrera &amp; Eva Longoria taking back the narrative that there can be more than ONE Latina slaying in Hollywood at a time??? AMAZE

Mamma Mia! ...that's NOT Luisa's mom. What gives??? #JaneTheVirgin
This whole Mutter storyline is getting totally crazy ...and totally confusing #JaneTheVirgin
ummm are you familiar with the Prince William test? Legit have never heard of it lol #JaneTheVirgin
Jane has some serious ammunition on her hands -- now will she use it to get full custody of Mateo? #JaneTheVirgin
I guess we now know where Jane gets her temper from! #jane
When Jane's mad, she unlinks you from her calendar. buuuurnn #JaneTheVirgin
Of course Luisa asks for an extra wet latte...I have no idea what that is, but it definitely sounds dirty -- just her style #JaneTheVirgin
NO MICHAEL! It is not better for you if everyone just "moves on" waaaaa #JaneTheVirgin
ohhhh nooo - I was right! What is Jane gonna do now??? Take up shifts at the hotel? #JaneTheVirgin
I think Rogelio paid for that "scholarship" ... #JaneTheVirgin
No Luisa, just because the hot detective wants to talk to you doesn't mean she wants you that way dot com #JaneTheVirgin
Pauper's pizza = plain cheese pie #JaneTheVirgin
Look at Xo counseling Rogelio on how to stick to a budget!Never thought she'd be the voice of reason-time changes EVERYTHING! #JaneTheVirgin
Nothing says holidays like tempers running hot ... #JaneTheVirgin
If the sight of Mateo in a baby elf suit isn't enough to make your ovaries melt, I don't know what is #JaneTheVirgin
