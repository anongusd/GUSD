To help our water infrastructure, Congress passed WRRDA to fast track some of our local water projects.
Most honest question I've heard: "WE NEED RAIN."  I couldn't agree more.
Q about bias in the media- I send out a weekly newsletter "Randy's roundup" w/ my personal account of what I'm doing- sign up on my website!
On IMM, we need to tighten up our interior enforcement to cut off the incentives of illegal immigration. We have a legal process in place.
We need to ENFORCE the immigration laws on the books before we pass more immigration policy. The president needs to establish credibility.
Remember, immigration is a legal process. Border security becomes an issue when people BREAK the law. Two different issues.
Without a secure border, we are not a secure country.
If minors are coming through our borders, what other dangers are sneaking through?
Border security: I visited a facility for 1200 illegal minors &amp; I know that's an issue. But kids only make up 20-25% of illegal immigrants.
Medicare? I think we need to update and reform to ensure we can preserve care for future generations.
Temporary policy isn't always good policy. Long-term tax policy, for example, allows us all to plan for our future.
First question is about NSA collection &amp; privacy. I agree it's important to find a balance between national security and civil liberties.
Thanks to the Mayor of Graham, Jack Graham, for the introduction. We're now starting my Graham Town Hall. http://t.co/AxauYV2ysS
It's good to be back in Big Country.
On the road this morning to Aspermont, Texas. Looking forward to meeting the new mayor there, Kathy Castaneda.
Come to the Library of Graham tomorrow afternoon for my Town Hall Listening Session: http://t.co/o3AaFx3De4
I have hope that more great men and women of sound faith are stepping up to serve our country. We're in need of some strong leadership.
Just asked about social security, the day before it's 79th birthday. A lot has changed since 1935, and we need to reform SS to match.
Now we're tackling the greater international scene. There's a lot to watch right now. The violence across the globe saddens me.
On Iraq, we need a plan. I want to really consider the best solution before moving forward. I'm watching this every day &amp; gathering info.
What about Iraq? Iraq is a wreck. I'm honestly not quite sure the path forward - I'm personally struggling with the best solution right now.
Where am I on Israel, Plainview asks? I'm siding with God on this one. I #StandWithIsrael. Do you?
A resident of Plainview asked about adding troops to the border, or surveillance cameras. Border security is extremely important to us here.
At my Plainview Town Hall, we're talking border security and immigration. I appreciate these‚Ä¶ http://t.co/30tnW0pX3A
The solution is for President Obama to enforce the immigration laws already on the books. We need to secure our border, and enforce our laws
In Plainview, I'm explaining the dif btw immigration &amp; border security. IMM is a legal process. Border security is when ppl break the law.
I'm in Plainview talking about how overregulation in Washington is hitting our checkbooks hard here. Do you agree? http://t.co/ed1uaNPpb2
Driving through cotton fields on the way to Plainview this morning. Glad we had a little rain earlier this week - we needed it!
