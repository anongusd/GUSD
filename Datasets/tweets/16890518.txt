The Senate doesn't schedule votes around the Senators schedules (what a nightmare). It's the other way around. Further, they had to wait for the FBI report, now the rules of the Senate have kicked in and they're locked into a timeline they cannot speed up without Democrats. https://t.co/e3CMEdGkGm
He said he'd be in DC "as needed"--as I said he'd better be damned sure Jeff Flake isn't going to Flake (or Collins or Murkowski) if they have the vote without him. He will pay dearly for that and so will the Kavanaughs and the rest of the country. https://t.co/KUcUdzr5z3

That's what I'm saying in a few characters. There are only two choices unless the Dems agree to UC the motion to end debate and move to final vote on confirmation. First rule of politics in a close vote: call the vote the MOMENT you have the number. Anything can happen even death https://t.co/8zhkyrlYom
They cannot vote on final confirmation until Saturday early evening (around 4:30p) unless they have unanimous consent  Unless he's figured out how to defy physics, he won't be there to vote at that time. So we sit and wait until he gets back? Or they have the votes without him? https://t.co/9aiAVfHYQ5

No, they can't. Senate rules don't allow for the vote to start debate until 10:30a tomorrow then 30 hours of debate required without UNANIMOUS consent, then you can call the vote which is right in the middle of the wedding. @SteveDaines won't do his job. https://t.co/QM1iHjdXS9
