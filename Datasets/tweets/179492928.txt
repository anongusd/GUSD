Other progressive @HouseDemocrats who do not have top staff of color in districts with a majority of people of color include @RepHastingsFL, @RepJuanVargas and @repjoecrowley. @JoeCrowleyNY lost to @Ocasio2018 in a stunning upset via @JointCenter
Other surprises might include @HouseDemocrats @RepBarragan. Before coming to Congress, she was first Latina ever elected to her local city council. District includes more than 90% people of color. But according @jointcenter, she has no top staff of color. https://t.co/phSR2cXH1k
Nearly 3/4th's @HouseGOP + @HouseDemocrats have NO top staff of color including progressive Dems like @BetoORourke @RepBetoORourke, now in battle for Senate w/ @tedcruz @SenTedCruz. Rourke district largely Latino El Paso County via @JointCenter (con't) #VoteBeto #CruzCrew #TXSen
A story that hasn't received quite as much attention as it should: a report came out this month about the lack of diversity among top @HouseGOP + @HouseDemocrats staff by @JointCenter. People of color account for 38% of the population but only 13.7% of all top staff (con't).
