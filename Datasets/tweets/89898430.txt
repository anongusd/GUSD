Straight up cannot believe how perfect the latest Jane Eyre movie is. I actually said "Oh Fuuuck" under my breath when it ended. A+ 🏆🌷
Ooookay also what I love about Jane Eyre is EVERYONES insane pajamas. Men don't have enough. Women have like 20 pj petticoats. 💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
Turns out that 20yrs have gone by since I first got horny to Jane Eyre&amp;that horniness is still RAZOR SHARP. Where the F is my Rochester tho
Holy hell why did nobody tell me that in the newest Jane Eyre film, Fassbender sleeps in a short nightshirt w slits on the side&amp;no bottoms🤙

Maria is incredibly intense to tell captain Von Trapp that "The reason doesnt exist anymore" for why she left. Very very loaded with emotion

Maria? If u want a to stay in the abbey then why do u always leave bc like, u can't even control yrself when they gates are open #horny
Oh ok "How do you solve a problem like Maria" is my vision &amp; nightmare of how people in my life try to process my identity
these sisters are so stressed "She Waltzes on her way to mass" &amp; also this whole "Maria description" feels like a personal attack on my vibe

Ive made fun of pilgrims so much 2nite. If my life was a chapter book Id wake up tmrw in 1600s Plymouth in a USA version "Devils Arithmetic"
Not to be a dick but is A LOT of archeology just a bunch of friends being confident&amp; us not caring enough to check their guesses? #WhoCares
This teenager from Jamestown died&amp;was eaten &amp; is the one person who I accept had a bigger bummer experience than me re: teen times
The settlers in Jamestown ate AT LEAST 3 of their dead. Thank u, PBS, for this unexpected holiday programming. No joke. I'm thrilled/gross.
The Mayflower was sold for scrap. WE HAVE BUT ONE LIFE LETS GET IT WHILE ITS HOT
Turns out Plymouth was INSANELY DEATH HEAVY
Other pilgrim facts, and this is a QUOTE from this TV show: THEY GOT COLD AND THEY DIED.
Fun pilgrim fact: advanced scurvy can create not just depression but the feeling of being doomed. HAPPY T-GIVES, Y'ALL!
YO IM WATCHING "AMERICAN EXPERIENCE: PILGRIMS" on WGBH like its 1988
If I see a ghost while holding this giant tub of jelly beans, does that mean that "my brand is authentic"

It's so tempting to say "I'll fix everything by focusing on (_____) &amp; deny all other things&amp; feelings" but it's not in my nature/appetite
Flight attendant just told me "you're a very nice drinker" Besides my best friends baby calling me "uncle jerry", this is my best experience
Ok @AmericanAir u should know that Purser Dianna Ventura is very nice &amp; good at her job but the rest of your staff are meanies&amp;very ornery

@maebirdwing also "and I'll go bathe." Is a MAJOR way to say a line.

When someone says something dumb, it's hard for me that I can't say I HEARD WHAT U SAID&amp;I WANT U TO TALK TO SOMEONE ELSE NOW
