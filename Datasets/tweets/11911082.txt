@ctrent You spelled "delightful" wrong.
@whithonea I think I have peaked with this fry experiment.
@TSindzinski Yeah, they were cool. I sort of assumed that people did this a lot, but judging their reaction I think we were the first, at least at this location.
@tamhodge Agreed. I can't believe I never knew this, but moving forward I feel like my eyes have been opened.
@tamhodge @m_vince Blocked and reported.
@tamhodge It is still the champion IMO. Out of the four of us, 2 voted light well, 2 voted light.
@BrandonRSwanson Light well FTW! Well, at least I think so.
@BrandonRSwanson @msjen We wanted to start pure. We may try our next flight all animal style to see if our voted change. Not tonight though ...
@uber_george @LuisLovesGoats Right on, George!
@TSindzinski The guy at the cash register genuinely couldn't believe we wanted all six variants, but then was all for it. I probably could have timed it better for them, not dueing a bust Saturday night.		The guy who gave us our order was laughing, probably at us not with us.
@gavinpurcell I think light well is the clear winner, but we the four of us couldn't agree in just one. Two for light well, two for light.
@tamhodge I led you astray earlier by indicating there are four. Sorry for the misinformation... let the record show there are six.
@jordanmaslyn Hmmm...that might be light well, my personal favorite.
@DevinKofsky Of course.
@anthonydimarzio I serve at the will of the people.
@ctrent False.
@m_vince Don't blaspheme In-n-Out! https://t.co/aZD5RSPzWE
@msjen Go with light well, they are damned near perfect.
Final verdict: the well are good at first but get hard too quickly.  Extra light also started strong but got too floppy too fast.		In the end, 2 votes for light well (my favorite) and 2 votes for light. It's a fry tie!		#murica https://t.co/pzYMUbAPwd

@safetysecurity I think spending winter in a better climate is an A+ move. We've talked about that in my house as well, and Costa Rica was on the list. 		I'm doing okay atm, but have noticed a pretty sharp rise in depression in those around me, more than usual.

@MichelleE_xoxo I'm glad they are. I'm talking about people I know well that struggle off and on (I am in that group) but it seems to be picking up frequency between bouts. It's weird. I'm just curious if there is an environmental catalyst.

@TomUrtis That is fantastic! Thank you, Tom. I'll give that a shot soon. I know how to delete dupes the non-macro way...do you have an example post of how to name/identify each separated area then de-dupe within a macro? Ultimately each sheet will only have 30 groups (30 days of entry)

@TomUrtis Missed this reply for some reason, thank you! So once the rows are inserted (effectively isolating each date range) then each range could be tagged in some capacity (e.g. A1-E422 are "day 1", A423 - E1011 are "day 2" etc.) and then a remove duplicates could be executed on each?

@zipdaddy I think I OD'd on cilantro a couple of decades ago and have never recovered.
@blaircook I'm the same. Every once in a while, there are a stunning number of priority one items, and the only way to get it done is to just dive in.
@TomUrtis One the entry period is over, there will be ~10k entries, many will enter once per day (so several duplicates, but within terms) some will enter multiple times per day (several entries, violation of terms)
@TomUrtis So if tom@example.com entered once on 2/1/19 that is fine, but if he entered five times on 2/2/19 I would either a) delete all duplicate entries for that day or b) delete all entries from him on every day as it is a violation of terms.
@TomUrtis It's all in a mySQL database, but I can easily export it to an Excel sheet. Basic fields are first name, last name, email, opt-in to terms. Hidden fields are IP address and time of entry.
@TomUrtis Yes, I think you understand it correctly. The "day" is easily definable, as the database puts a timestamp on each entry when it is submitted, so I would use a 24 hour clock based on Pacific Time (UTM -8)
Fascinating article. If you have sought answers to life's questions based upon a DNA test a la 23 and Me, check this out. 		"Can DNA Tests Tell You If You Have a Cycling Gene?" https://t.co/AzZBjm23WE
@TomUrtis I have a sweepstakes database, the rules are people may enter once per day, but more than once per day voids their entry. The unique identifier is email address. So if tom@example.com enters only once per day, fine, but if multiple times per day (any day) he is deleted?
@TomUrtis Hey Tom, perhaps related, can you think of a way to sort a list (in this case by day) and then de-dupe or even delete multiple entries based upon a unique identifier, but only if they are within the same day?

@TheGoldman It's a very fair question. You're totally right.

The fact that my tiny companies pay far more federal tax than Amazon and make far, far less than 1% of what they do infuriates me. 		Don't retweet the story &amp; laugh it off as something ethereal in a far off land...this is OUR infrastructure that they are using and not paying for.
I see people retweeting the Amazon tax story and saying cute things like "I need a better accountant haha". No, we, as a country, need better regulation of this bullshit, legal-but-far-from-ethical corporate behavior.		They route through dozens of countries and screw the U.S.
This story about Amazon paying $0.00 in federal income tax really pisses me off. Again. There have been reports like this for years.		My small business pay a metric shit-ton of federal taxes, and it's not always easy, and it doesn't always feel fair. But we do it.

@safetysecurity I'm sure they were completely fine with that.		I think I'll have a personal emergency when tax season rolls around.
R.I.P. checks and balances in a political environment that includes three branches of government specifically to prevent things like this from happening. 		It's no longer a slippery slope, it's a mudslide.
"Trump to declare emergency for border wall."		Not only is this utterly ridiculous, it sets a very bad precedent for future presidents.  Can't get something you want passed through congress? Just declare a national emergency for/against ____ (healthcare, right to assemble, etc.)

@SavIsSavvy That's my feeling as well. When dealing with low-volume but high cost (like consulting), having just one client because of it makes all the difference. 		It sucks up front though, cash wise.
@Aerocles Yes, but only once.
@SavIsSavvy Non-SEO answer, but my marketing mind and my understanding of social behavior says "yes".		When toll-free numbers mattered, 800 numbers mattered. Ask people to dial an 866 and they would still dial 800 first.		I think the same goes for .com's, just in terms of behavior.

@rcadden I'm not on YouTube enough to care I don't think, whereas music discovery is actually very important to me.		Since my recent switch I've found some amazing artist in hip-hop, ambient, classical and alternative. Super stoked to expand my music tastes! I'm glad I made the switch.
@rcadden Second, Spotify has an app for Samsung Galaxy Watch, Google Music does not. This is what put me over the top.
@rcadden Two reasons, really. First, the new music section on Google went from the ability to filter new music by genre to just "new releases" which was mostly top 40/hip hop. I like that okay, but I also like a lot of other kinds of music.
I've switched music services from Google Play Music to Spotify. I wish there was a way to export then import playlists, like an OPML or CVS, it would save so much time. 		If there is something like this and I just don't know about it, please let me know. https://t.co/i3ygAJAPvP

@gavinpurcell Well, then, I'm sorry to inform you that you are in fact crazy. https://t.co/UR6DeeuCkr
@TSindzinski I would tend to agree when it comes to people like Kim Jong-un, I just suspect that P*tin aspires to more than the decadence of watching chaos.
@gavinpurcell Beets. 		Not me by any means, but crazy people. Only crazy people eat beets. They straight-up taste like a handful of dirt.
@TSindzinski Right, exactly what I'm saying. So then I ask why? What would be the purpose of having your enemy in a state of chaos and discontent? What would one do at that point to gain an advantage?
That's enough from me,  lest you think I should bunk up in a rubber room. 		I'm just saying that in today's climate of global information and currency that is only backed by credit of the government, the only way one country takes on another is economic espionage. The end.
I don't consider myself a conspiracy theorist, I'm too pragmatic for that. I'm not suggesting boots on the ground, I'm suggesting buying our banks and real estate after a sufficient period of turmoil. You think a hyper-extended shutdown doesn't end with an economic crisis?
If it is true (collusion), spend some time asking yourself "why?" What would P*tin have to gain? Perhaps it's as simple as relief of economic sanctions. 		I think it's too much work, too much risk to aim for anything other than slowly, ultimately taking control of our country.
Plenty of people online and off express the opinion that Tr*mp is working for the Russians, knowingly or even unknowingly. 		What I don't hear people talk about is the end game, if that is true. 		You think P*tin simply wants to watch us shit ourselves?
As a long-time strategist, if I were advising one super power how to take over another in modern times, it would be this: don't fight w/ guns, fight w/ money. Cripple the morale &amp; finances of infrastructure (e.g. TSA, FBI) and let the country slide into chaos.		#TrumpIsAPuppet

@CountessMo @kristy I really might just be too sensitive about it.  I'm successful now and I get to enjoy the privilege of being able to start an additional company (@HelloBlueCBD) but I haven't always been so. I remember when I HAD to have multiple gigs to take care of my family, and it wasn't fun.
@kristy @CountessMo I think my sensitivity is broken down as "has to" vs. "wants to". Kind of like riding a bike. If you want to ride a bike, it's a joy. If you have to (perhaps no other transportation) it kind of sucks. 		I feel like lately people who want to SH are devaluing those who have to.
@kristy @CountessMo You phrase that well. I think that's what is getting to me about it...the Google 20% is one thing, but somehow Side hustle has been turned into something else. I still can't put my finger on it, but it feels like it devalues those who have to have multiple jobs.

@elaineinspired hahaha! Somebody told me they feel the same way about our Asana just a few days ago!
@michaelkrivicka She bought me a four pack of lessons. FOUR, MICHAEL. My personal goal is to make it through all of them.
It's also an example of me walking the talk...I love to encourage others to get out of their comfort zones, to try things they wouldn't normally. I think it produces growth. 		We'll see. In my case it may just produce a frustrated vocal teacher ü§£
I love to sing (in the car, by myself) but I wonder if I'm tone deaf. I know that the reality is very few people are truly tone deaf. 		Anyway, I think it's an awesome gift. We value experiences over things, so this will be quite an experience! I'm looking forward to it.
When I took guitar lessons years ago, for our final project our instructor told us to write a song that included lyrics &amp; perform it for the other students.		He heard me sing and said, "let's work on it." After A LOT of effort, he said, "just stick to guitar without singing." Ha!
I'm about to do something that is as far out of my comfort zone as it gets.		Singing lessons.		My fiance got lessons for me for my birthday. This is funny for a couple of reasons; I can't carry a tune to save my life, and my voice is amazingly low. Like...Barry White low.
@davidj @Aerocles I've seen it referred to in a negative fashion as of late, and it bothers me. The insinuation being that supplemental work is bad (again, I don't think it is, I think it can be good). 		Might be more isolated than general. I'll keep an eye out for it.
@davidj @Aerocles I don't think there is anything wrong with doing supplement work (to be considered a job or not) if you want. I actually think that's great. I do it also.		I'm not sure it's a completely baked feeling in me...I'm just bristling at what the phrase "side hustle" is turning in to.
@Aerocles I think that is how it was originally intended, but I'm seeing a lot of articles and hot takes about "side hustle" as a 2nd job...and putting that in a negative light. 		I love the idea of passion projects, hobbies, creative outlets.
@CountessMo I've been trying to put my finger on why that term has been bothering me lately. It's popping up in more and more articles. I think for me it sounds a bit privileged. I get the idea behind it, but it just rubs me the wrong way for some reason.
@ChrisMLandry I totally get that. For some reason I can listen to music with lyrics in the morning, but as evening approaches I have to go to straight instrumental. Not sure why.		Anyway, I love Steve! I think I'll queue him up next...
I think "side hustle" is an entitled way to talk about work. 		I was having lunch at a cafe recently &amp; heard 2 staffers talking about how many other jobs they had. One had 2 more, the other 3. "Side hustle" is only said among white collar workers.		Am I wrong? Too sensitive?

@elaineinspired If I remember correctly, owning a $15,000 toilet is NOT one of your problems, right? Didn't you win the CAH auction?
@elaineinspired Haha! I hear that. I do too.
@elaineinspired Lucky you!! Seriously, that's great.
@elaineinspired Most people take it for pain and/or anxiety. I take it for a weird autoimmune disease I have called Ankylosing Spondylitis which is kind of like arthritis. It's worked really well for me in terms of comfort. My partner takes it for help w/ anxiety w/ good results.

@fatcyclist I use an app called Fat Secret (https://t.co/ZidupuydW6) to track calories during the winter. 		It is a bit tedious to record every little thing you eat, but for me that's the magic. I can't just stuff my face with cookies w/o logging it. 		Helps me more than anything else.

@cfgbrady I love the way you put that!
Very well said!		Success comes from getting it done, not getting up early.		(We were talking about that @inc article that says successful people up at 4am) https://t.co/h4EJT0wk32
@alexmonney That's awesome man, great work!		I really wish you had said "Still feeling like pooh from the weekend flu..." given the GIF you picked, but I'll let that go.
@cfgbrady Isn't that the truth? Most of our clients are US based, but I have had several in Asia. When they want a conference call around their schedule, I am up at 4am...or 11pm! Sometimes it's hard to nail a schedule down.
@cfgbrady Right. Also, if you are successful AND very, very wealthy, you can pay a lot of people to do a lot of things that would normally take up most peoples' time. It's not possible for me, as a dad and business owner, to get up at 4am and still get at least 8 hours of sleep each night.
@adam_buchanan Me too. 8 hours each night or more for this guy.
@JohnFrost @whithonea Exactly right.
@whithonea That's a good question. Feeling like crap all the time, I think.

@cfieds Just realized my second reply might sound like a sales pitch. Ooops! Not my intention! 		I make a good living but was still blown away by CBD prices; yet I knew it helped me and probably helps others...so I've become somewhat passionate about it over the last year.
@oceanchick677 I have Crohns, so I truly empathize. Diet and exercise have helped me a ton, but I have to say that I think CBD is what put me over the top of considering myself healthy despite the condition.
@cfieds Regarding cost, I thought the same thing when I started taking it about a year ago. 		I was frustrated enough with the obviously crazy-high margins companies were making that after I started taking it, I began to work on that price puzzle. Watch this space in the new year üòÅ
@cfieds It's definitely a bit expensive right now. I think that with the passing of the Farm Bill and legalization of CBD/ Industrial Hemp we'll see price drops as more product becomes available.

@kristy Oh good. I've lost both of my parents, my dad a long time ago to brain cancer. I think he would have really benefited from CBD had we known about it then.
@kristy First, I'm sorry you lost them :( 		Second, I hope it helped them out. It helps with my weird arthritis-like disease, hearing some good stories of other people finding relief for various things as well.
@aaronkrubio @CoalitionBrewin That's awesome! Have you ever tried CBD without alcohol? Wondering if you feel the same effect.		I take it for pain as well, it's very helpful.
@geekgiant We would all be blacked out by the weekend.
@TheGoldman I suspect you are right, although probably not as egregiously as President T. I hope this scares politicians straight, although that's doubtful.
@PMD17 That's so fantastic to hear! Wow, what a relief for her (and you!)
@cfieds I hope it works for you! It's helped with my pain quite a bit, I think. What kind of daily dosage are you trying? I take 40-80mg/day right now.

@GrayBlue That's my experience as well. Really helpful over time with some aches and pains I struggle with.
@kevinpalmer That's interesting. I've heard varying stories about CBD with dogs. I know somebody who gives it to their dog and it certainly seems to help, but more with anxiety than unbridled energy I think.  Maybe dog breed matters? Not sure.

@EvolveTom In my newfound mature adolescence, I've been reading a lot of Stoic philosophy. It's helping me to cope with this reality of never feeling like an adult, despite the fact that I am (at least legally).
@EvolveTom It is weird to think about. It's weirder to think that people have been contemplating this for so many centuries, yes for us, living now, it feels like a new revelation, obviously because it is so personal.		We can read about aging, but it doesn't really prepare us for it.
@EvolveTom I think the odd irony of this, and something I struggle with, is that by recognizing we don't feel like adults, we are more adult than we used to be. In my early 20s I thought I had it all together. Now I know I don't. It's an irony that comes with age and understanding.

But don't forget, kids, life is full of pain and damning disappointment.  My man Marcus knows...		"So remember this principle when something threatens to cause you pain: the thing itself was no misfortune at all; to endure it and prevail is great good fortune.‚Äù - Marcus Aurelius
And Seneca...damn that dude had a good head on his shoulders. On love:		"Joy comes to us from those whom we love even when they are absent...when present, seeing them and associating intimately with them yields real pleasure." 		Intimate association is the true pleasure of life.
But don't forget Epictetus!		‚ÄúWhoever then understands what is good, can also know how to love; but he who cannot distinguish good from bad, and things which are neither good nor bad from both, can he possess the power of loving? To love, then, is only in the power of the wise.‚Äù
‚ÄúReject your sense of injury and the injury itself disappears.‚Äù - Marcus Aurelius
‚ÄúIf you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.‚Äù - Marcus Aurelius
If you haven't read the Stoics, you should. I don't mean on Instagram, with pithy quotes by Seneca &amp; Epictetus. I mean really reading them. 		Dig into Marcus Aurelius, the full text of Meditations. At some point life hits you like a fucking fast ball. It helps you accept what is.

@whithonea Me too. Greedy pricks.
@DatingRev Ha! That's awesome. It happens.
@DatingRev Doing ok. Yes, that was one of my air filters...they all looked that way. Ugh. We were among the first to get evacuated last week, left our house at midnight Thursday. It was surreal and scary for sure. We are back, our house is fine. Many neighbors' are not.

@joshuaziering A fair point! It also helped that it came on at 3pm, my mom watched it religiously, and I got home from school at 2:50.
@joshuaziering No, it always needs one.		Also,  thanks for not asking me how in the hell I knew this. It'll be our little secret.
@joshuaziering Although technically I was wrong,  apparently that is ANDRE DiMera, Tony's evil cousin. But that was like 3.5 decades ago, so I am cutting myself some slack.

@reilly_creilly @KTLANews Thanks!

I seriously cannot believe all of our local news channels in Los Angeles are not playing news. Our city is burning to the ground, and they're broadcasting Football games.
@jennifervides I just DMd somebody and used the same word: helpless. 		We are no match for the wind and the fire, and it makes us feel small. 		Just hoping the winds don't kick up and fuck us all over again.

@GeorgestJamie When I called you a moron, I meant it sincerely and in reference to your lack of understanding of 1) geography 2) ecology. When I called you an ass hat, I meant it sincerely in reference to your lack of empathy and decency. 		What I meant was, go fuck yourself.
@DebraBalke Do you mean Robin Hood Lane? Those are the mobile homes as the end of Triunfo near Lindero, right? We couldn't get there, it was blocked (and of course behind a gate) but from up above on Ridgeford it looked okay!
@joeWatt90864007 Hey Joe, we didn't drive on Cedarcliff Ct but went by on Rockfield by the park, and all houses around that area looked okay. I think you're in good shape there.
@leastimnotfugly Of course. Thanks for pointing it out to me, I knew it of course, but appreciate the prompting to share it with others.
@falsifiedd It's our pleasure, Bai. Happy we could do something to help people feel better.
@lglisa Hey there. For the most part, yes. We did a live streamed drive by earlier, you can find it somewhere back in my tweet stream. There were some small buildings by the ball fields that were affected, but the big buildings looked fine.
@rqskye @bkf360 @ABC7 Yes, we have power and have since we got her last evening. I drove up Churchwood drive earlier and live streamed it, it looked like power was on but I cannot say for sure at every house.

I just saw @ABC7 report that dozens of homes were lost in Oak Park/North Ranch/Westlake Village area. Many of you did too, I'm sure. I couldn't see what area he was talking about, but I'll head out soon and check. I know you are worried for your home.  Stay strong. #WoosleyFire

@marykdiamond Other side of Kanan from Golf Course, near St Maximillian church. I think it is safe, there are a lot of embers around, but no active fires that I saw.

@calipidder No, it's just right. I'm anxious too. Today is going to feel like the longest day of all time.
I strongly encourage you to look up the actual text of each proposition &amp; read them for yourself. It's not as quick as skimming the voters' guide, but it's really the only way to get the truth about what the measures say. Do the work please, it is important. Thanks. #ElectionDay
So the pro/con arguments in the voters' guide assume (probably correctly, most of the time) that voters will just skim over the two sides and make a decision.  Since it's not fact checked, they just lie, and put the lie in BOLD and try to scare people. Such horse shit.
What's really infuriating is that the voter guide is not fact checked. I read through the actual text of several propositions, then looked at the arguments for/against. Guess what? So many straight-up lies about what a measure would or would not do. Like...total bullshit.
Well, it took about 3 hours, but I have read through every proposition (including full text of several) and all candidate positions and am ready to vote tomorrow. Let's do this!		#ElectionDay

@jmitchem Indeed it is true. Ignorance wins the day again, but hopefully not for much longer.
@jmitchem That said, I agree with you. It's weird. And yes, everything is backwards and broken.

@ianwalker @carltonreid @timrbassman @CultOfCyclists @Forbes Gotcha. Not calling out your study, just saying I think I would be ill advised to try that regularly here.
@ianwalker @carltonreid @timrbassman @CultOfCyclists @Forbes In the United States it is illegal to impersonate a police office, so unfortunately I think that option is off the table for me when it comes to bicycle safety.
@timrbassman @carltonreid @CultOfCyclists @Forbes @ianwalker That feels like a bit of a stretch to me. Perhaps in a controlled environment it's possible to recreate that (perhaps, but it seems unlikely), but real-world scenarios as so varied, I don't think it's worth the risk.
@ianwalker @carltonreid @timrbassman @CultOfCyclists @Forbes I run front/back lights during the day. It requires some high-lumen flashers. Would love to have you consider this in future tests.
@ianwalker @carltonreid @timrbassman @CultOfCyclists @Forbes Thanks for doing work like this! I'm sorry to hear about the outcome, however.  If I am reading you correctly, what a cyclist wears (including helmet or not) doesn't affect driver behavior?		Did you test cycle lights front/back of bike? I'm curious if that changed anything.
@MatthewSnedker @carltonreid @Forbes Matthew, here is the ride where I was hit https://t.co/dOKKEcL0P0		I guess it doesn't show where I live, but I guess you'll need to take the word of a stranger on the internet when I say it was just a few blocks from my house.
@carltonreid @timrbassman @CultOfCyclists @Forbes @ianwalker Sounds interesting! I will read the paper when I have some time, I love that kind of stuff.		The abstract sticks out to me though, "Bicyclists probably cannot prevent close overtakes by manipulating their appearance." Am I reading the abstract incorrectly?
@timrbassman @carltonreid @CultOfCyclists @Forbes I suppose we subscribe to different philosophies. I can only control what I can control. 		I would love to train care drivers and cyclists better. What a world that would be! But it's not happening. Until it does, I will control what I am able to and protect my head.
@MatthewSnedker @carltonreid @Forbes I don't absolve the driver in any way. I strongly advocate for better cycle infrastructure and law enforcement. Those are separate issues I'm glad to be able to come home to my children because I was wearing a helmet.
@CultOfCyclists @timrbassman @carltonreid @Forbes That is true, I agree with you, but for now (at least in the United States) cyclists must adhere by the same rules, e.g. full stop at stop signs.
@timrbassman @carltonreid @CultOfCyclists @Forbes Volume of cyclists for awareness is much different than helmets for awareness. 		I love group rides, and yes I think they are more visible than solo cyclists. In parts of our city where there are more riders (e.g. Santa Monica) I think drivers are generally more aware of them.
@CultOfCyclists @timrbassman @carltonreid @Forbes You're right, I would be surprised. I don't think this is true, but I'm open to learning if you would like to link me to studies.
@timrbassman @carltonreid @CultOfCyclists @Forbes I think that's a rather bizarre look at things. You think a cyclist not wearing a helmet would make drivers more aware? 		I would say that having flashing lights, front and back, and obeying traffic laws while riding makes drivers more aware.
@carltonreid @CultOfCyclists @timrbassman @Forbes Fair enough. It's a personal decision, and I trust you understand your roads better than I do. 		My neighborhood is more spread out as I'm outside of Los Angeles.  Higher posted speed limits, longer stretches w/o stop lights. Great risk if a big impact, I think.
@timrbassman @carltonreid @CultOfCyclists @Forbes Motorists suck. They text and drive and don't pay attention. They rush to get where they are going. They hurt or injure too many cyclists.		Does that mean I'm going to not wear a helmet? Hell no. I wear it every time, even a short trip to the store.
@timrbassman @carltonreid @CultOfCyclists @Forbes Here is an article with some pull quotes from me, just a couple of months ago: https://t.co/Jqp1Lu0izC
@timrbassman @carltonreid @CultOfCyclists @Forbes Yep, society sucks when it comes to bikes, recognizing what is right and wrong, and making fair judgments. No doubt about it.
@CultOfCyclists @carltonreid @timrbassman @Forbes Look, if you want me to argue that cars are safe and awesome, I'm not going to do that. I prefer riding my bike. 		However, the risk is substantial when riding, even for a bump from a vehicle, or a rock or hole in the road, to sustain at least minor head injuries.
@CultOfCyclists @carltonreid @timrbassman @Forbes I don't think safety equipment increases risk taking. The instances of motorist deaths skew heavily toward a younger demographic. I think it has to do more with life stage than equipment in the vehicle.
@timrbassman @carltonreid @CultOfCyclists @Forbes I have to disagree with you. A helmet isn't a confession of fault, just like wearing a seat belt isn't.  Cycling in traffic is inherently dangerous. I seriously doubt a motorist sees a cyclist wearing a helmet and thinks, "great, now I can hit them."
@CultOfCyclists @timrbassman @carltonreid @Forbes The marks on my helmet were fairly indicative of the impact and drag across the pavement. 		So why don't you wear a helmet on the road? You like the feel of wind in your hair? You don't like being told what to do? It's uncomfortable? I honestly want to know, not baiting you.
@carltonreid @CultOfCyclists @timrbassman @Forbes But why not road riding? Perhaps we spend different amounts of time on road bikes (I spend a lot) and so you are assuming lower risk with lower time of exposure. I am on my roadie a lot, so I assume more time on bike = greater chance of head trauma.
@carltonreid @CultOfCyclists @timrbassman @Forbes While true, other safety measures are put into place in other instances. Cars have air bags and safety belts. Showers have non-slip flooring installed to lessen falling, etc. 		I just don't understand the absolute insistence of not wearing a helmet while cycling.
@MatthewSnedker @carltonreid @Forbes Would you prefer that I phrase it "hit by a person who was driving a car"?
@CultOfCyclists @timrbassman @carltonreid @Forbes The car didn't strike my head, my head struck the ground after I was thrown from the bike.		What advantage do you receive NOT wearing a helmet?
@timrbassman @carltonreid @Forbes Up to you, chap. I was hit and almost killed about 3 blocks from my home.
I respectfully disagree w/ this take. 		"Car crashes and falling are worse so I won't wear a bike helmet" is a fallacy of relative privation. Bike riding is increasing YoY and so are rates of traumatic brain injuries associated with riding. Not wearing a helmet is irresponsible. https://t.co/Rn9miO9O6L
@carltonreid @Forbes To each his own, I suppose. Personally, a bike helmet is the only reason I am alive today after being hit by a car while riding in 2014. 		Have you looked at injuries, not just fatalities? Helmets make a lot of sense in this case. https://t.co/YwHqK8C6id https://t.co/sx2U3MuZ8c

@marshallk @anildash @Atul_Gawande @farnamstreet (Reading, obviously, not readying)		As these concepts relate to climate change, and the seemingly insurmountable task of influencing others, I will keep doing what I can and encouraging others to do that same. 		It may be a fool's errand in the long run, however. I hope not.
@marshallk @anildash @Atul_Gawande @farnamstreet I've been readying a lot of Stoic philosophy lately, reinforcing the idea that 1) I need to do what is right, regardless of others' actions and 2) I must accept that I cannot control other's actions, although I can certainly try to influence them.
@marshallk @anildash @Atul_Gawande @farnamstreet I think those skills would serve you, or anybody really, well in almost any discipline. Change management skills are at the core of most things, from biz leadership to family cooperation. I think you're smart to approach it that way.
@marshallk @anildash As Anil said in his article, "human societies are bad at catching on to creeping threats". It's a sobering thought. Until the threat is in our face, fight-or-flight, I'm hopeful but not confident that we'll make moves that are society-wide.
@marshallk @anildash The stakes are brutally high. My family &amp;I talk about this often. We still eat *some* meat but have reduced our consumption by ~90%.  We ride bikes a lot, especially short trips, e.g. groceries. We try to do our part, but it's clear we are in the minority. I weep for my children.

@WomenAndStress Thank you for standing. I will be behind you and beside you, doing whatever I can. You take the lead, I will follow and support.
Anger without action just causes sleepless nights &amp; high blood pressure, so I will focus my anger not just in voting, but by encouraging, supporting &amp; lifting up the women I know. Be the change we need, ladies. I will follow you and help however I can, and so will others.
If I could wave a magic wand and replace every single male in federal and state government with a strong, resolute woman I would do it.  Obviously, that won't happen. So I'll keep watching this disgusting miscarriage of democracy unfold, and I will stay angry as fuck.
At this moment, it feels hopeless. I say that as an affluent, middle-aged, cisgender white man who wants this bullshit to stop. If I feel hopeless right now, I can barely grasp the despair that survivors feel. I am so sorry. However, I will not stop fighting for what is right.
I know that if I'm having this hard of a time with it, there are countless women who are suffering in silence, remembering their own trauma, staying quiet while all of this is thrown in their face. They are being told that their pain doesn't matter, that justice isn't truly just.
I'm so upset by what is happening in Washington. I cannot stop thinking about the injustice that women face, about Dr. Ford's testimony, about my friends, my colleagues and my daughters, I am sick to my stomach that sexual violence against women is so prevalent, and is ignored.

@jmitchem Again, I don't disagree. Just answered your original question.
@ChrisMLandry Ha! You are right!
@jmitchem A key point that I am not sure is clear is that I think Tr*mp is a piece of shit, and I think our economy would be just as good but probably even better if he wasn't in charge.
@jmitchem Also, you probably know a ton of people who have benefited from this. A ton. Almost every pension mutual fund is a combo of stocks and bonds. It doesn't always pay out in wages.		BTW, I don't have a pension fund, so I have to do the best i can now.
@jmitchem I hardly saber rattle. I just answered your question, you asked if anybody you know on here has benefitted.
@jmitchem The stock market is an indicator, but only one indicator of many. I've tweeted about this a lot. It's far from THE indicator.
@maryrenouf Thanks for doing what you are doing, Mary!
@jmitchem I don't disagree, although I would say it's not a zero-sum game, so I don't think they are the *only* victors.		Make no mistake, I still don't think the Cheeto Jesus is to credit for this. A robust economy is the result of a series of complexities.
@jmitchem Hardly. We are all losing right now. I am doing well in some areas though.

@jmitchem Totally get your point, but I have to be honest and say that I have personally benefited from the stock surge, as well as the corporate income tax cut. Not big numbers because I'm still a small biz, but enough to notice.		Also, I still think DJT is a garbage dumpster of a human.

For me, the best time to seek a therapist is when I'm not dealing with crisis. I consider it preventative medicine, and I would really encourage you to try this if you have been on the fence about seeking help.
I've seen therapists, off an on, for about two decades. I used to only seek the help/advice of a therapist in times of turmoil, but as I've grown older, I see that therapy can be for so much more.
Off to see my therapist.		That could be the entire message, but just to put it into context, I'm going to start talking about this more regularly, because seeing a therapist is still often stigmatized; thought of as desperation, or only for the very mentally ill.

Off to see my therapist. 		I'm sharing because I think going to a therapist is one of the best things you can do for yourself &amp; others. 		Unfortunately it's often stigmatized, but the more we talk about it, the more normal it will seem, like "off to the gym".

@Freakonomics @lancearmstrong I have to say, this interview with @lancearmstrong really impacted me. My high crimes and misdemeanors have never been so public, so global, but I could feel him as he spoke.		I've ridden in groups with him before, although we haven't spoken. I feel differently about him now.
@Freakonomics @lancearmstrong I had a pretty rough morning with some lingering family issues, so I took my ride this afternoon to clear my head. Freakonomics is usually about behavioral economics, but today it was about a person who made a mistake, doubled down on it, then hit rock bottom. I could relate.
@Freakonomics @lancearmstrong I have lived "that moment" where the world (or so it felt) was against me for things I had done. It's not a good feeling. When Lance talked about a woman from his foundation saying she felt complicit throughout, and how badly that made him feel, I felt his pain. I've been there.
@Freakonomics @lancearmstrong But I've never be a pro-cyclist, so it's not like I have that much skin in the game. Anyway, the whole interview, especially the last 15 minutes, really hit me. A story of contrition, a story of fatherhood, a story of finding oneself.
On my ride today I listened to the latest @Freakonomics podcast that, appropriately enough for my ride, was an interview with @lancearmstrong 		I have to say, it really hit me in a way I didn't think it would. Like many cyclists, I was mad with how things went down with him...

@pfrazier @alanajoy @kristy @joinme @zoom_us I'll DM you Paul. Right in the middle of a write up for a client, but should be done in about 40 minutes. You going to screen share w/ me? :)
@alanajoy @pfrazier @kristy @joinme @zoom_us That's good to know! Just to be clear, that means they do not have to call into a video conference at any time, right? They just click the URL I send them in a meeting and open a screen share window in their browser?
@pfrazier @alanajoy @kristy @joinme @zoom_us But does Zoom provide a link JUST for screen sharing? This is for agency-client work.  Clients rarely want to join a video conference, but want a single link to click and view my screen.
@pfrazier Think https://t.co/vTXipP4chr but without the annual contract.
@alanajoy @kristy @joinme @zoom_us Just looked it over at the urging of @pfrazier 		It looks more like video conferencing software than just straight screen sharing/team collab...yes?
@pfrazier That looks like video conferences with screen sharing. Does once have to be in a video conference to use? Just want to screen share via a link, talk on the phone on our conference line.

I'm sick of kids sharing active shooter drills as part of what they learned at school today. I'm sick of my kids being worried that they are next. I'm sick of kids dying across this great country of ours because guns are so prevalent.
This morning another robo call went out saying that there will be a strong police presence at the school, and they are considering cancelling the rally. They reiterated that it is a "non-credible" threat.		This is the world our kids are growing up in and I'm sick of it.
But she went to school today anyway. Today is an all-school pep rally. She and her friends have all been discussing how that would be the optimal time and place for an active shooter to do the most damage. They're scared...
A robo call went out from the school sharing details and calling it a "non-credible" threat. Apparently the pic was intended to be the boy sharing the gift he was getting from his grandparent for his birthday. 		To say that it rattled my daughter would be an understatement...

@GradyLocklear I completely agree. Hyperinflation of currency over the total economy (national/global) *sounds* like a great way to get rich, but at that point it is an investment not a currency. In investments, for every person than wins, somebody has to lose. Not a good way to run a budget.
