Most SOTUs are a bit disjointed; they usually sound like they were written by committee because they usually are. This speech seemed to truly lack a coherent theme... series of ideas and complaints with only immigration as a centerpiece
During the touching tribute to the Pittsburgh SWAT officer, POTUS has left out the shooter’s other motive for the shooting besides anti-semitism... the shooter was angry with the Tree of Life’s support for refugees
Interesting to hear POTUS go out of his way to be vague about who the U.S. is negotiating with in Afghanistan... trying to downplay the fact that essentially the U.S. is negotiating with the Taliban.  “The other side” etc... he went with that phrase twice.
This is a speech being dominated by immigration and the wall now... everything else will look like window dressing post-SOTU compared to his focus and fury over immigration.  This feels like he’s decided he wants the issue for 2020 more than getting this issue behind him in 2019.

Speaking as a frustrated season tix holder who answered every pre payment call from the Nats for the playoffs and all star game these last few years, this week feels like a massive gut punch. Did Rizzo have more financial handcuffs both last offseason and now than we realized?
The Nats are now an afterthought and they only have themselves to blame: on the field, in the dugout, in the front office and in the owner’s box.  Only upside: Its been a team effort I guess.
This was a pr disaster for the Nats: 1) they sent the message they didn’t want Bryce (by admitting they shopped), 2) that signals they won’t bid seriously on him in the winter and 3) they don’t think the Nats can win now. Other than that, well played! https://t.co/1HY5X811My

Today’s performance will be seen by some as circumstantial evidence.
The president tries to pull a “both sides” on the Putin v US intel and ends up essentially confessing to the world that he believes Putin more the the United States of America and its agencies.
Putin has so out maneuvered the US side, the “ball” being the cherry
Seriously, the morale hit to America’s intelligence community will be devastating.  Don’t think Putin doesn’t know and love this. https://t.co/UmezylzxKz
Not sure if you’d call it “collision” or “cooperation”
It’s amazing, Putin and Trump are coming to each other’s defense on both questions so far.
Will serious Congressional Republicans still truly sit back and say nothing following this POTUS performance on the world stage uttering what he’s said while standing and UPLIFTING one of the great adversaries of freedom and democracy?
Wow, Trump is going out of his way to praise Russia.  I guess “wow” is now an understatement, but this is truly a remarkable moment in American history, 72 hours after the DoJ accused Russia of a criminal act against the democracy, POTUS essentially forgives Russia on world stage

Interesting choice by WH to lead with the issue of immigrant crime before talking about a dreamer compromise.  This may be about him trying to reassure the base that he still cares about security even as he proposed Dreamer amnesty.

Jones now ahead in raw vote.  Uncounted areas are in Jones turf.   Unless there is some hidden Moore vote that hasn’t been counted...
Bottom line: AL turnout pattern is similar to VAGOV just slightly less pronounced.

If Vegas were setting a line in ALSEN, it would likely be Moore as a -3 point favorite, simply for “home field advantage.” It would make betting Jones +3 points a very popular wager because he’s run the better race.  Good enough to beat the spread and maybe good enough to win.

You can’t judge baseball in Miami fairly because the very first owner was a city of Miami antagonist... His initial decision to call them the Florida Marlins was among the first of many terrible mistakes. It should be Latin America’s favorite team, and yet... https://t.co/SotW2VvOcf
Fair point... that stadium deal was a BOON for the Marlins and they rewarded the city with... this https://t.co/MSPmHiaoOJ
The most unsuccessful franchise over a 25 year period that somehow has two championships... It’s what the owners did to those teams that only reinforces the point that Miami has been cursed with bad owners https://t.co/08IXMJmpu9
@JohnRestaino13 And now this disaster with the latest ownership group...
@JohnRestaino13 Selfish and short sighted owners... and MLB has awarded the wrong owner EVERY time. Owner 1 (Huizenga) had the BRIGHT idea of NOT naming the Marlins after Miami. Then, to the relief of DC, MLB refused to let failed Expos owner Loria have the Nationals but gave him the Marlins
...every single Marlins owner has acted like some hedge fund manager who buys the team, strips it of its assets in the name of “rebuilding,” only to once again drive away another generation of potential Miami Baseball fanatics. Stanton is a once in a generation player... dreadful
As a Miami native and Baseball fanatic, I always dreamed of living in a city with a MLB franchise. I somehow moved to one of the OTHER few cities (DC) that didn’t have one either... Miami got its team AFTER I left. But I was excited... and yet [1/2]
It’s been surprising how the sports world (at least lately) appeared to have escaped this cultural moment... until now.  https://t.co/Pb1ykyUXn3
