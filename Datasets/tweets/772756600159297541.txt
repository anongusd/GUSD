@LinBennett @wesleydonehue So you spread a falsehood and instead of owning it with an apology, you are just going to double down on the lie.  THIS is what is wrong with the Republican Party! A lack of honesty and integrity.
@MichaelAvenatti Dear gosh, this Tweet reads like something Trump might Tweet.  And as soon as I typed that, I realized why 😂😂😂
@EdCSutton @JoeCunninghamSC This is an example of the deceitful trickery that is turning many of us away from the Republican Party.  The intellectually dishonest liars for Trump.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Mark Levin, the man who wants to shred our constitution with not one, not two, but ELEVEN Amendments.  No thanks.
@UnitersCentrist @frequentbuyer1 I've never even heard of a national convention for centrists.   Is there such a thing?
@UnitersCentrist @frequentbuyer1 It feels overwhelming.  The amount of $, manpower, branding, and the different groups claiming trying to lay claim to the center.   IMO if there is a constitutional amendment on the platform,  it doesn't seem very center to me.
@cslick803 That does help.  Thanks so much!
@cslick803 How many meals do you order per week if you mind me asking?  I am thinking my son is likely to eat about the same LOL
@cslick803 I will save the link.  My son is moving into a new home over the next month and I thinking of getting him a subscription, but I may end up with one too LOL
@cslick803 Do you have some kind of subscription where they send you food to cook?  If so, I am interested in knowing what it is.  You post some yummy food pictures!  &lt;3
@EdKrassen 😂😂😂
@fitsnews @collins_neal Quinn's comments are beyond criticism. He launched a nasty lying campaign against Rep. Collins, or at very least participated in it.  He targets constituents who agree with Collins w/his pet labels.  He even takes those disagreements to his public page, smearing constituents.
@fitsnews I admittedly do not know what the law is ...
@fitsnews Yeah - the difference here is Quinn has ran against Neal at least twice and is likely intending to do so again.  He wants to use EVERY ONEs platform to promote himself and spread lies about Rep. Collin.
Good information on the CPAC narrative. https://t.co/K6GSFYnPqY
@NKaeding 😂😂😂
@LindseyGrahamSC @SenatorTimScott When the moment comes and incriminating evidence is presented in the case of Trump.  What are you going to do?  Ignore it, blame it on the Democrats, or take action to remove him?  If you haven't considered that possibility, I hope you are now.
@RepRalphNorman @MichaelCohen212 @GOPoversight You aren't interested in the truth, you are interested partisan politics. Inexcusable!
@CGasparino @RipVanWallison I obviously am not very good whole Twitter disguise.  I use my real name, followed by the state I live in 😂😂😂
@Voters4Kasich It's sickening ...
@Bakari_Sellers @StaceyPlaskett I was just looking her up.  Very impressive!
@Kathrynbcampbel @NikkiHaley Yeah and I bet you saw that coming too :-)
@Kathrynbcampbel @NikkiHaley Yeah, I think I'll hop off here before you start channeling dead babies to support your beliefs.  You take care too.
@Kathrynbcampbel @NikkiHaley That's some kind of psychic power you have going on over there - I'll stick with the facts.  If you are sick and unable to tell your doctor that you want a DNR order written, a family member or close friend can decide for you.
@Kathrynbcampbel @NikkiHaley Do you have a living will?  I do.  I get to choose CPR or DNR.  As should the mother.  You are just trying to paint a graphic image for partisan politics.  I highly doubt even you believe your own spin.  Have a good day.
@Kathrynbcampbel @NikkiHaley This is spin.  NO ONE wants to kill a baby that is living.  NO ONE.  The bill isn't designed to save life.  It is designed to threaten doctors.  Leave the choice between the woman and her doctors.
@Kathrynbcampbel @NikkiHaley "The bill would force doctors to resuscitate such an infant, even if the parents did not want those measures..."
@Kathrynbcampbel @NikkiHaley "If it seems unlikely that the baby will survive, the family may choose to provide just comfort care — wrapping and cuddling the baby — and allow the child to die naturally without extreme attempts at resuscitation."
@Kathrynbcampbel @NikkiHaley I had preeclampsia, a result of getting pregnant at 42.  This article does a good job explaining:  https://t.co/Tj6XcgxItP
@Kathrynbcampbel @NikkiHaley Abortion is not as binary as some like to make it. I've never had one, never will.  I have had a high risk pregnancy/deliver late in life.  I know the risks &amp; I fully understand the gut wrenching decision a woman might face.  I had no young children at home to consider.
@Kathrynbcampbel @NikkiHaley Again, this bill ONLY addresses babies that can survive outside the womb, which is 24 weeks and appx 1% of all abortions performed. Again, there has already been a law passed for born alive infant protection.
@Kathrynbcampbel @NikkiHaley I personally knew someone who had in vitro.  Three eggs attached. Doctor recommended moving one, because the likelihood of losing all three were great.  That gave the other two a greater chance at survival. Mother refused.  All three died.
@Kathrynbcampbel @NikkiHaley NO ONE wants to kill babies. It would be a gut wrenching decision. Women are having babies later. After 35 the health risks to both the mother and the baby increase.  The likelihood of fetal anomalies, that are incompatible, with life increases.
@Kathrynbcampbel @NikkiHaley First, your data point is inaccurate.  Abortion is on decline and it much less than a MIL per year.  Second, is it possible that 1% of pregnancies would be terminated due to fetal anomalies INCOMPATIBLE with life?  That is a very small percent.
@Kathrynbcampbel @NikkiHaley They DO NOT happen all the time.  Approximately 1% of abortions are performed after 24 weeks.  You can verify that on CDC.
@Kathrynbcampbel @NikkiHaley You are running on emotion v reason.  Take a step back and think about it. This bill accomplished ONE thing.  A wedge issue for Republicans to "claim" Democrats want to kill babies.  It's a lie!
@Kathrynbcampbel @NikkiHaley The big difference in this bill, it allows the woman to sue in the case the baby is born alive.  Women do not carry babies beyond 24 weeks seeking an abortion.  It is typically a fetal anomaly incompatible with life and/or mothers health.
@Kathrynbcampbel @NikkiHaley It is simply a Republican wedge issue to ride all the way to election.  That's whole goal of the bill IMMHO.
@Kathrynbcampbel @NikkiHaley No it doesn't.  The only thing the new bills does is threaten doctors with criminal charges!  Read it.  	https://t.co/wM7Omug7pn
@Kathrynbcampbel @NikkiHaley Get the facts.  Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002 was signed into law by George Bush August 5, 2002.   https://t.co/eQkj1ehfd0
@LindseyGrahamSC My gosh!  Republican have sunk so low, you included, you have no moral high ground whatsoever!  Your feigned outrage is nothing more than partisan politics.  Shame on you!
@NikkiHaley You seem to favor murdering women and destroying the career of any doctor who might try to save her life!
@NikkiHaley I'm sure you are aware there is already a law to protect Born-Alive Infants, you are just running with a wedge issue.  You know full well what this bill does and doesn't do.
@NikkiHaley President Bush signed into law the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002. This bill isn't about protecting human beings born alive. It is about threatening doctors with criminal charges! Appx 1% of abortions occur beyond 24 weeks, typically fetal anomolies/mothers health
@baseballcrank https://t.co/7vbwgllB9E https://t.co/UengAhgxUE
@baseballcrank He Tweets regularly to Trump and Trump has retweeted him.  Far right conspiracy theorist and full of it.
@nrlc President Bush signed into law the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002. This bill isn't about protecting human beings being born alive, it is about threatening doctors with criminal charges! Apx 1% of abortions occur beyond 24 weeks, typically mothers health/fetal anomolies

@cslick803 It's not the same at all, both my parents are still living for now. I can relate on a smaller scale of losing my BFF of 13 years.  My sweet dog.  I'm afraid I will forget him, so every day I think about him and cry just a lil. Every memory, more special.
@themorganrpt @TJTackleberry @mariootsa @Bakari_Sellers @jaketapper @themorganrpt He's likely a troll of 14 followers, over 2k Tweets and a gun saves lives image.  That is why I didn't respond.
@Sali1368 @mariootsa @Bakari_Sellers @jaketapper Maybe our life experiences are very different. As I mentioned, while I live in SC, I grew up in WV. We had an entire population of one black family in our tiny town. The Warner's. You might remember Curt Warner, Pittsburgh Steelers. We graduated same HS. No blackface.
@Sali1368 @mariootsa @Bakari_Sellers @jaketapper What is your goal? If you just want to complain there is nothing I can do about that.  I am treating you with respect, I am making an effort to understand, maybe you could extend that same courtesy.  Just sayin'
@dadadadiox @Sali1368 @mariootsa @Bakari_Sellers @jaketapper Never witnessed anyone wearing it either.  I do live in the South, but I didn't grow up here.  I truly believed racism was gasping it's last breath ...
@Sali1368 @mariootsa @Bakari_Sellers @jaketapper Way to win friends and influence people. Wow.
@AndreFWashingt1 @49Westend @mariootsa @Bakari_Sellers @jaketapper Thank you for the honest dialogue without judgement.  I really appreciate you!  Hope you have a fabulous day!  Together we might make the world a lil bit kinder.
@themorganrpt @mariootsa @Bakari_Sellers @jaketapper Already shared the article in a FB group that has been discussing this very topic.  I will also share it on the page and I do talk to friends.  Several friends have also helped me understand.  &lt;3
@MS_Grace54 @mariootsa @Bakari_Sellers @jaketapper Below article was the first time I recall hearing anything about blackface and even then, I didn't understand why it was offensive.  I do now, but it's a recent understanding.  https://t.co/QBu562m2s5
@AndreFWashingt1 @49Westend @mariootsa @Bakari_Sellers @jaketapper I will look them up.  I do remember Tom &amp; Jerry cartoons, but I'd have to watch them again, based on what I know today, to understand what you might  be referencing.
@AndreFWashingt1 @49Westend @mariootsa @Bakari_Sellers @jaketapper It's difficult to know if I might have 30 years ago - I didn't understand it was offensive. While I live in SC, I didn't grow up here, there wasn't any emphasis on blackface in WV that I can recall. I'd like to think I wouldn't have. I know I didn't.
@CigarDaisy311 @Baby2u2 @mariootsa @Bakari_Sellers @jaketapper I've heard it used as "guys and gals" meaning men and women.  Don't recall hearing it in any other context.  But I'm down with that happy hour 😂
@49Westend @mariootsa @Bakari_Sellers @jaketapper Never heard of it until after Trump was elected.  Don't ever recall seeing anyone dressed that way and didn't understand why it might be offensive.
@Baby2u2 @mariootsa @Bakari_Sellers @jaketapper Interesting.  I thought it referred to all females, but Google indicates it was a derogatory term used in the south to demean women of color.
@Baby2u2 @mariootsa @Bakari_Sellers @jaketapper Ok, now I need to know what "gals" means LOL.
@mariootsa @Bakari_Sellers @jaketapper I disagree with that statement.  I want to understand and he did a great job explaining.  People don't get it, because they haven't been exposed to it.  I didn't even know blackface was a thing or what it meant.  BTW I graduated HS in '84.
@marcorubio How is money an expression of free speech, but activities aren’t?  I detest that Citizens United ruling, but it did set a precedence.  Spending money on campaigns is an “activity” afforded corporations based on 1A.  I don’t see the difference.
@kpomerleau Kyle, what are the pro and cons of a progressive tax on realized capital gains?
@MichaelBindner @BudgetBen TBH, I don't like either option. It is too binary. I would prefer something a little more comprehensive. A little more of a mix. There are numerous ways to achieve fiscal equity with less risk of upsetting the markets. BTW I'm not econ person, I just follow a bunch smart ones ;)
@MichaelBindner @BudgetBen I don't the impact a wealth tax could have:  lower ROI on investments, lower GDP, lower employment. It's not a new idea, it has been tried by other countries and abandoned. i.e. I read a study the other day where Germany was looking at reintroduction of wealth tax. Bad policy IMO
@RealBuzMartin Had Trump not of touted all those libel laws, claim fake news daily, this would likely be a non issue.  Apparently the jury didn't have strong opinions on the degree of libel given they only fined him $1.  As I recall Bingham was given oppty to correct the record

@BudgetBen I don't like the wealth tax at all.  Taxing a household's net worth gets tricky, even if it is &gt;$32 MIL. People could be forced to sell assets to pay the tax.  And how many times will they pay that 1% tax? Annually?  No.

@RadioFreeTom Mitch answers to Trump.  It's more about how long @realDonaldTrump will allow Ann Coulter to be POTUS.

@Jacquelinecs12 @frequentbuyer1 @dcexaminer To my knowledge there was no pathway to citizenship offered.
@frequentbuyer1 @dcexaminer The language is confusing.  What I want to know is what do they plan to do with the 2.7 MIL or so Dreamers who have been living here in some cases for decades.  I didn't hear a clear solution.
@marcorubio What about the appx 2.7 million Dreamers who are already here?  Who have lived among us for decades? Why temporary DACA?
@Fan33Tiger @brithume Yeah - I don't see SC going that way.  Last legislative session legislators introduced legislation for in state tuition for DACA recipients. DACA recipients are people who were brought to America (or in this case SC) as children.  But who knows what the future holds for them?
@frequentbuyer1 @dcexaminer I believe it was only temporary for DACA appx 700k v appx 2.7 MIL Dreamers.
@brithume The President has offered some temporary conditions in exchange for a permanent wall.  Hardly the compromise I was hoping for.

@marcorubio @POTUS Both sides should compromise in good faith and do what is best for our country.
@grynbaum @BuzzFeedNews Hmmm....maybe they could share their sources with other media outlets to corroborate that story.  I find it incredible that Mueller's team would feel the need to speak out if in fact their article is fully accurate.
@realDonaldTrump Doing nothing?  I thought they were paying for the wall!
@jaketapper It's likely to be just another *it show for his base.  Hope I'm wrong.
@BillKristol While I'd love to see a mainstream Republican challenge Trump, I doubt that is realistic UNLESS Trump resigns or is impeached.  TBH not sure I even care anymore. After 30 years voting Republican before Trump, I now have very lil common ground.
@senatemajldr Sen. McConnell, I would very much appreciate it if you would work on cleaning up the Republican Party.  Imagine what could be accomplished if you focused your energy on unity v division.  The Republican Party is splintered and weak.  You know it.  I know it.

@SenatorCollins @SenAngusKing O how sad.
@wrthomasson I wore contacts for years! I ended up with a corneal ulcer. Now that eye has a terrible floater and no good options. I wear my contacts sparingly. Most things I now do, don't require glasses. My vision is still bad, but getting better with age.  Near sighted benefits :)

@wrthomasson Yeah - I usu just scroll on by, but since you are a friend, I decided to reply :)

@AOC @RepMaxineWaters Congratulations!!!
@deadlevelbest @AOC Yup.  I have to run, but will check back later.  I must say I am impressed by your knowledge and genuine willingness  to communicate.  Your aggressive style?  It's rough on Twitter ;)
@deadlevelbest @AOC That's different than the plan she has proposed of taxing those who make over $10 MIL and I would like to see that scored (static and dynamic) by a number of economists, same requirement I have on all policy.
@deadlevelbest @AOC This article is left leaning and well sourced:  https://t.co/1WnRETK2Xt
@deadlevelbest @AOC You mean this study:  https://t.co/Dno9DtJAIn
@deadlevelbest @AOC I don't the see the data to back that.  I see an article from I think The Hill that you posted.  I would like to see the study that supports that data.  Not a spin, but the raw data.
@deadlevelbest @AOC What is one of our largest government expenditures?  I believe interest has surpassed even military spending.
@deadlevelbest @AOC I support the best healthcare for all, that makes good economic sense.  I misread your "liberal bias" comment.  I don't see a case where taxing those who make over $10 MIL per year is going to pay for Universal Healthcare and isn't that the topic?
@deadlevelbest @AOC Awww ... you aren't looking for solutions, you are a right winged troll.  Well, I'm not there anymore - the right moved so hard it really nukkin futs.
@deadlevelbest @AOC Yes, but I will allow you the opportunity to explain that to me and the interest we are paying on that debt.
@deadlevelbest @AOC Do you want to have a conversation or are you a leftist dictator?  For me personally, I'm just trying to find a way to get out of this mess that we can all agree on with the least amount of damage for all of us.  		There is a middle road ...
@deadlevelbest @AOC And if you don't believe that, look at the accumulated debt and ask yourself who is going to pay for it?
@deadlevelbest @AOC Debt is a deferred tax that younger generations will pay. I have two children that I don't want to burden with debt.  Do I like free healthcare?  Absolutely!  But there is no such thing.
@deadlevelbest @AOC Take a look at this debt fixer, particularly as it pertains to Healthcare, though I recommend the entire exercise: 		https://t.co/z2LjQTbZPw https://t.co/9XnOfVexqK

@deadlevelbest @AOC You were too busy bashing me &amp; I was too busy responding to rapid fire to catch your source.  I've read that.  I will provide a link to a middle of the road study and you can easily see the costs associated with plans.
@deadlevelbest @AOC And you've clearly proven yourself to be a man of self interest.  Whatever that interest is.  I don't need your man 'splaining.  Doubt AOC does either.
@deadlevelbest @AOC Show me the data.
@deadlevelbest @AOC I'm not debating my skills against hers.  She's too sweet and smart for that kind of conversation.
@deadlevelbest @AOC They didn't just take a leap of faith! I know someone else who listens to their gut &amp; it is not working to our benefit. Is it realistic, good and achievable long term?  		“Better never means better for everyone... It always means worse, for some.”
@deadlevelbest @AOC Show me the data and I'll give you my answer.
@deadlevelbest @AOC I do believe this - AOC has the best intentions and brain power.  She will find a way to make both economical and social sense.  All she needs is a lil time.  Love her enthusiasm with a lil sass :)
@deadlevelbest @AOC I respectfully disagree in the near future.   More boomers are retiring and people are living longer.  Entitlements are our biggest expense.  IF we could fund it without destroying the economy, I would favor it, but I don't see the numbers to support it.  Anywhere.
@deadlevelbest @AOC As is mine - GenX.  401ks are our best hope, since SS is going broke.  As other tax models have predicted, you can't raise enough tax revenue to pay for Universal Healthcare.  Option to buy in? Obama put the infrastructure in place.  It's there.  Use that and price caps.
@AOC We have a tax system in place that is similar.  I recommend revisiting Hillary's plan.  It paid for itself.  Careful what you ask for.  Your generation will bear the brunt of bad tax policy.
@KateBolduan @JohnKasich Kasich is a strong voice on what the future of the Republican Party should look like.  One of his biggest assets is his pragmatic approach, best used as a voice for rebuilding the future Republican Party.  Glad to see him continue good works!
@EdKrassen @thehill @Harris_X_ @AOC @seanhannity Why not consider Public Option? Lower debt.  More Opportunity.
@EdKrassen @thehill @Harris_X_ @AOC @seanhannity That 70% marginal rate is a bad idea.  Not enough people who make $10 MIL per year for it to make a hill of beans, let alone pay for universal healthcare. I am firm believer it will have a negative impact on the 401ks that many of us use for retirement.  Hillary had a btr TP.

@McFaul So that's how it is *supposed to work.  Is there any mechanism in place to get those records if DOJ requires them?  Can they subpoena the translator? I would assume so, but who the heck knows today.

@mkraju O FFS @LindseyGrahamSC you know the man is a danger to the country. You said it pre election! And now to watch you fawning over him while undermining our institutions is not only sicking, but down right frightening.
@RepAdamSchiff I do agree there is some caution required to keep the trust between foreign leaders.  But someone from DOJ should know the details of those conversations.  Can't DOJ subpoena the interpreter?
@WilDonnelly And that's why I stopped calling myself a Republican!  Never voted for Trump and never will.  What we have now isn't a Republican Party.  It IS the party of Trump.
@krassenstein I don't really buy the "mental instability" line as an explanation of his behavior.  I personally believe he is a compromised treasonous crook trying to cover his own ass.
@realDonaldTrump The damage done to our country by the Twit in the WH will take years to repair!
@Orion_Pauls @EdKrassen Dude you've been on Twitter since 2015 and have 50 followers and thousands of Tweets.  Just another Russia mouthpiece as far I am concerned.  Zero interest in your comments.  Go find another thread to troll.

@AOC In all fairness, I don't even think Koch Bros support Trump.
@peterbakernyt Graham is gambling with his core voters and chasing power.  I don't see a win for him unless he steps back center.
@WatchYourRepsSC @LindseyGrahamSC He is losing his base. His base isn't the hard right. They will never vote for him. His base has been moderates. He is giving an opening for a good Dem challenger. Could it be Cunningham?
@WatchYourRepsSC I don't even get on Twitter before coffee LOL
@realDonaldTrump Yes Sir!  We all know that you and you alone can fix all our problems.  The same man who has declared Ch 11 bankruptcy SIX times, who refuses to show his tax returns, and wrote off almost a $billion in losses just before being elected President.  Stopped cold!
@wesleydonehue And ... I have voted for Sen. Graham every election, but unless he changes course, I do not intend to vote for him ever again.
@wesleydonehue His approval rating will not translate to votes IMMHO.  I have asked those on the hard right who support his actions now if they would vote for him in the future.  Every. Single. Time.  The answer is NO!

@AlanMCole And those GE voters are left with two binary choices, because they didn't vote in the primaries.

@realDonaldTrump Then do something.  A worthy cause to discuss with Congress.  the lil guys are getting squeezed.  You/Congress handed out big ole tax cuts to corporations and instead of investing in people, they are raising their damn prices!
@cbeckpdx @Noahpinion Be prepared to lose money on stocks if this ever happens.  I don't have $10 MIL per year in capital gains, but I can imagine what would happen to stock prices if this were in play.
@Noahpinion I declare, I would pull money out before paying another damn dime in taxes for a retirement plan.  I'd rather draw the more secure interest rate as I imagine any individual with money invested in the stock market might. Horrible idea.
@Noahpinion I would rather put my money in a dawg gone mattress than pay another dime on money already earned.  We pay fees for investment, we pay taxes on dividends and now you want MORE taxes on capital gains.  How is that going to affect 401k's or other retirement earnings?
@Noahpinion Seriously?  Those of us in GenX who have saved our money and invested in the stock market, because there is NO guarantee of Social Security or Healthcare any time in the near future, we pay taxes on dividends and NOW you want to tax capital gains as well?
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes I had this big rebuttal in mind, but you really aren't worth our time.  I hope your days as POTUS are limited and you just go on to live your life somewhere outside the public eye.  You are toxic.

@aje430150 @CGasparino @MikeBloomberg You may be fine with capital gains tax, UNTIL they sell off their stock and your 401k reports all losses, no gains.  I'll pass on the capital gains tax.

@TheDiane0905 I think I am going to do the same.  I don't care for his Tweets at all.  Too divisive and inflammatory.
@wrthomasson We went from a big concrete wall that Mexico is paying for to a "thing" that we are paying for.
@CGasparino @MittRomney @realDonaldTrump I personally hope he is looking to pull the GOP back from Trumpism.
@wrthomasson Depends on how rural you go.   One of our best restaurants, without a drive, is a gas station 😂
@KayaBear15 @McFaul I translated it from Russian LOL.  It means Happy New Year.
@BillKristol Meanwhile Trump is Tweeting just the opposite:  "An all concrete Wall was NEVER ABANDONED"
@realDonaldTrump Tweet.  Tweet.  Tweet it all out.  These are the lies that we care about.  C'mon I'm talking to you ...

@realDonaldTrump I read your Twitter feed daily for the most current updates.  Please Tweet more details about closing the Southern Border. 		The Centrists &amp; Democrats can be a pesky lot!  They care way too much about the children dying to get in America.  Pathetic I tell you.
@realDonaldTrump Good sir, can you please define in concrete numbers what the big wage gains were?  And who benefitted the most?
@FinchelFan728 @frequentbuyer1 @DiamondandSilk @wrthomasson @rk4391 @DuhonL @realDonaldTrump I've read mixed reviews of the guy who created the account.  Seems some good and shady history?  I just don't see how you can volunteer to pay for a wall, when we couldn't volunteer to pay down debt?  Will be interesting ...
@FinchelFan728 @frequentbuyer1 @DiamondandSilk @wrthomasson @rk4391 @DuhonL @realDonaldTrump I dunno, but I will be watching.   Not sure there is any mechanism to take in funding for Government projects.  Years ago, I recommended an add on to tax return to pay down debt ...
@FinchelFan728 @frequentbuyer1 @DiamondandSilk @wrthomasson @rk4391 @DuhonL @realDonaldTrump And what are the chances that money will actually be applied to any border wall?
@doodah2942 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews I'd really like for the President to take his time and Tweet it all out.  It may take several Tweets, but being he is the President and all, maybe Twitter could allocate some extra characters for full announcement of all foreign policy.  I can't imagine what might go wrong?
@Uatu10 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Nice reply ;)
@coppertime @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Yup.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Mr. President, can you please describe in great detail how you intend to close the Southern Border?  The majority of us would prefer you Tweet this information, so we have a hard copy of your position on this very important matter.
@Voters4Kasich @realDonaldTrump Yeah I imagine those soybean farmers looking at Trump like, "what the fertilizer have you done now?"
@twolvesfanbuck @BernieSanders I'm more interested in finding common ground where it can be found :)
@travis_parrett For all we know that GoFundMe wall is funded by none other than Russia in hopes of creating more chaos.  Or ... a bunch of poorly educated Americans that Trump loves.
@vickiringer @MPowersNorrell I know right?  LOL.
@LindseyGrahamSC And while I am a strong supporter of border security, not a fan of any wall - that is just one more distraction.  IMMHO
@Voters4Kasich @BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump 😂😂😂
@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump Someone needs to trim that babies fingernails, or put lil socks on its lil hands, so it doesn't hurt itself.
@EdKrassen Who even knows what the heck he is talking about?  What's he going to do, send all troops there?
@MPowersNorrell I showed someone a picture of you during the last campaign.  I kept bragging how smart you are.  But ... when they saw the picture ... the first comment was how young you are.  I had to Google to prove you weren't in your 20's LOLOL.
@jimsciutto No confusion.  No misleading.  Just lies.
@BernieSanders Rehabilitation not incarceration.
@AlexParkerDC I've only watched two and a half.  The first one was really weird.  So weird I had to watch the second one.  I really liked the second one, but now the third is ... just not very interesting yet.

@MichaelCohen212 But your phone was there?
@senatortomdavis @realDonaldTrump Absolutely agree!  They need to check POTUS!
@KaivanShroff Trump is visiting soldiers so he can come home and say how much they want to be home.  I imagine several soldier quotes, taken out of context, in support of his withdrawals.  Trump doesn't give a care about the soldiers.  They are a tool to be paraded for his personal gain.

@thedailybeast This seems so incredible, even for Trump, difficult to believe this is real?
@Fanning4Senate Wishing you and yours a very Merry Christmas.
@realDonaldTrump You know what's really funny? Most of your base are freaking lazy and uneducated.  I notice when you have a lot of 'likes' on your comments, it has to do with Russia.  I'm not as lazy, nor am I your flavor of Republican (Anarchy).  You need to end this shutdown.  It's all on you.
@SarahJKS77 @Bridget826 @JeffFlake I don't agree. His voting record doesn't agree. He has spoken out as much or more than anyone.  So much, that he jeopardized his Senate seat and decided not to run, likely unelectable. That is integrity to me. Disagree with him on policy all you want, but recognize the good too.
@BillKristol Dear gosh, I hope we are not discussing politics over Christmas lunch/dinner.
@EdKrassen Me:  Get off your fat ass and do something useful, like maybe serve in a soup kitchen.  Lotsa people there ...
@JohnJHarwood He is just flexing his muscle.  He wants to save the day.  He has claimed without him the stock market would crash and now trying to prove it.  As soon as the stocks take a turn in the green, he'll declare it a win.  He's gambling with our livelihood on most fronts.
@mrayem @Bridget826 @JeffFlake He wrote a book that was published in 2017, which means it was in the works long before then.  Sen. Flake is a bit to the right of me, he was yesterday's hard right and apparently today's Democrat LOL.  Regardless of any policy differences, I do respect him as a man of integrity.
@realDonaldTrump You lash out at anyone who disagrees with you.  You are an insecure petty lil man with a big ass!
@Bridget826 @JeffFlake Sen. Flake tried.  Which is more than I can say for most of his Republican colleagues.
@WatchYourRepsSC @cdoyle222 @LindseyGrahamSC @SenatorTimScott Yeah - they demand we be self sufficient and then screw us for trying.  So. Much. Winning.
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @freedomcaucus Exactly!  As long as he is guided by the so-called and misguided Freedom Caucus, no bi-partisan solution in sight.
@TheDiane0905 @PreetBharara It has to be an improvement over reading Trump's Tweets 😂  Joking aside, we have lil Disney Animated Christmas Tree that my husband replaced batteries yesterday.  I caught myself humming to the music while cooking.
@realDonaldTrump Poor poor pitiful you.  Your terrible horrible no good very bad days ... are numbered.  Maybe you should move to Russia?
@realDonaldTrump That is BS and you know it.  Shutdowns cost American in lost productivity.  Maybe Mulvaney could explain that to you.  O and where is your 4% promised GDP?  I am sure this shutdown is really going to help us get there.  🙄
@realDonaldTrump And a Merry F*cking Christmas to you too.  I guess we know how you are spending your holiday.  Tweet bashing.  #WorstPresidentEver
@realDonaldTrump Respected again my ass.  We look like Putins personal puppets, all because of you!
@realDonaldTrump Yeah, the problem I see is our President is unhinged and unfit for office.
@BillKristol I like Mattis, but not as POTUS.
@BillKristol Nothing would please me more than to see Congress work together and override the bully in the WH

@GregShugar @realDonaldTrump Hate is a strong word, but I really, really, don't like him ...
@libertylatina Nukkin Futs!
@realDonaldTrump JFC - it's almost Christmas and all you can do is HATE on people.  Your ego gets in the way of good sound policy and actions. #WorstPresidentEver
@realDonaldTrump O FFS all you did was screw the Party that voted you in! What used to be my party! We are NOT isolationists. We are NOT damned cowards. We DO work together for common good.  		Mr. Con Man, I hope your days behind bars are many.  You are selling out America for UR personal agenda.
@thirsty_mcgirt @washingtonpost Embarrassed to say so. I did at one point believe him to be honest. That started changing around 2008 &amp; has now turned to disgust. 		People change over time. Some good. Some bad.  His was awful or exposed? Either way, no one I care to listen to.  He's just cruel and unkind.
@washingtonpost I am embarrassed for O'Reilly. He went from being a highly respected Fox New Personality, to a low life that settled for some $32 million for sexual harassment allegations, and now seemingly wishing death on one of the most brilliant minds of my life time.  Disgusted.

@SmallBiz4Kasich @Voters4Kasich @Win_Ott @mmartin9095 @RealBuzMartin @garyclarysc @RepJeffDuncan Trump only cares about getting wall funding due to his fear of his own base. That could be addressed later, everyone wants border security, but he knows Dems are going to control the house after holiday. Instead of working together, he is exercising his fear based bully tactics.

@realDonaldTrump JFC I hope they impeach your sorry ass and you spend the rest of your life behind bars and lose all your money for the crimes you have committed.  You are a HORRIBLE person.
@Voters4Kasich @LindseyGrahamSC Yep - read it a few minutes ago.
@TheDiane0905 @Voters4Kasich @aaskolnick @tribelaw @GOP @LindseyGrahamSC @marcorubio Some skepticism is healthy.  We are all frazzled this week.  I'm still reflecting on my hateful Tweets to Trump that probably won't even be read 😂    		Cooler heads prevail.  We need to think long term, instead of allowing Trump to drive the narrative.
@TheDiane0905 @Voters4Kasich @aaskolnick @tribelaw @GOP @LindseyGrahamSC @marcorubio It is an imperfect world with imperfect people participating.  Yes, integrity matters.  But compassion, understanding and forgiveness do too?
@TheDiane0905 @aaskolnick @tribelaw @GOP @LindseyGrahamSC @marcorubio O I believe he will be gone before then, but we'll see.  IF the evidence is there and enough support from the people - it can happen.  IF the evidence is there and not enough support.  Trump could win another term and in his best interest to do so.  IMMHO.
@Voters4Kasich @TheDiane0905 @aaskolnick @tribelaw @GOP @LindseyGrahamSC @marcorubio I believe the majority prefers they would have taken action sooner, but there is that rowdy base to contend with. If we want to impact change, we must support them on areas of agreement. Let's just be crystal clear here - no impeachment is ever going to take place w/o R support.
@TheDiane0905 @aaskolnick @tribelaw @GOP @LindseyGrahamSC @marcorubio And how exactly do you think Trump is going to be out of the picture UNLESS some Republicans hold him accountable?  There are not enough Democrats in office to do that.  Must have help from Republicans.
@aaskolnick @TheDiane0905 @tribelaw @GOP @LindseyGrahamSC @marcorubio Wow!  I am going to ditch this thread, because you folks are even more angry than I am and I'm pretty angry right now LOL.
@TheDiane0905 @tribelaw @GOP @LindseyGrahamSC @marcorubio When people feel cornered they will try to get along, as long as they can, and then come out fighting.  Our entire Establishment Republicans are disappearing and I don't think that is a good thing.  I believe it is too polarized.  We need to step back and let them work with Dems.
@NicoleCNN @jaketapper @CNN JFC
@TheDiane0905 @tribelaw @GOP @LindseyGrahamSC @marcorubio I'll agree to disagree and respect your strong op.  However, I will support him when he does the right thing and I will call him out when he doesn't. We can't change the landscape on our own.  We need members of Congress to step forward.
@TheDiane0905 @tribelaw @GOP @LindseyGrahamSC @marcorubio Just a reminder, Democrats do not have a supermajority.  If turn away from those who are trying to step up ... I feel we are trampling opportunity.
@TheDiane0905 @tribelaw @GOP @LindseyGrahamSC @marcorubio Not asking you to vote for him, but agree, where agreement can be found.  Otherwise, we leave them with no choice but to stick with Trump or retire - Neither of those choices help America.  If we want their help, they require our support.
@TheDiane0905 @tribelaw @GOP @LindseyGrahamSC @marcorubio Trump has bullied everyone, including members of Congress, using his base to do just that.  They are a small base, but roudy.  We need Congress to fight FOR America.  Not some fringe nationalists, nor Putin, but America as a whole and restore faith in our institutions/democracy
@TheDiane0905 @tribelaw @GOP @LindseyGrahamSC @marcorubio Never too late to do the right thing.  They are cornered by Trump's base.  We need to help get them out of that corner, so they can fight in ours.

@BillKristol Agree - they should override.
@BBJJ445 @VP @POTUS @DeptofDefense Not their money, so they don't care.  We are going to oversee SPACE when we are neglecting to oversee our Country.  No morals.  No leadership.  Our only hope is the day they are no longer in office.  		And ... this is just one more diversion from all things Russia.
@BettyMcCollum04 @realDonaldTrump Absolutely agree.  @LindseyGrahamSC @SenatorTimScott you can address the border another time.  But please override POTUS now.
@realDonaldTrump I'm glad we are no longer have to be PC.  Now I can tell you what "a dick" I think you are too.  O and traitorous, self interested, criminal!
@realDonaldTrump You know damned well this isn't about our soldiers.  It's just one more nod to Putin for help. As a former long term Republican, you are not only a disgrace to the party, but an absolute disgrace to America &amp; allies. This is about saving your own ass, not our soldiers or America.
@realDonaldTrump My Senator is too much of a gentleman willing to work across party lines, to say what I have to say to you. You are a dirty rotten crook that cares more about your partnership w/Putin than you do America &amp; ur actions show it. Ur lies are catching up with you. Middle Class my a$$

@LindseyGrahamSC He is desperate to control the narrative.  Banning bump stocks and pulling out of Syria diverts attention from the Mueller investigation, his charity foundation, and all those close to him who may now be cooperating with DOJ.  Not going to work.
@wrthomasson @SCGOP @SCGOP cares more about power than people.  Win at any cost.  Needs new leadership and a platform that doesn't mention Ukraine.  Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap should be their new theme song.

@frequentbuyer1 Disappointing, but pretty much what I expected.  Hope the Dems find a good candidate!  We have a crook in the WH and dumbass SCGOP throwing their support behind him.
@McFaul You usu make some very good points. Like I express to what is left of my Republican friends, maybe we (all in the middle) should move past the "lock her up" comments created by Russia and spewed by some on the far right.  Let's work on issues that still matter. Together.

@gelles Gives the impression the Mueller investigation might be nearing the end ...

@fitsnews Enjoy it while you can, they grow up way too fast!
@RealBuzMartin @fitsnews @realDonaldTrump Clinton's biggest mistake was lying under oath.  What Congress did wrong at that time, was to let it slide.  Hindsight is 20/20 and if this was the ONLY thing on Trump, I could shrug it off, but it isn't.  It's just one of many ..
@fitsnews I had someone on a news site saying it is the liberal democrats who support MJ that Conservatives don't support that 😂
@geoffgarin I would imagine a good portion of those now identifying as Independents, were Republicans before Trump.
@Amy_B_Lazenby @MichaelAvenatti I hope he tells all.  Doesn't change my opinion of him much - he hasn't been a nice nor good person.  But it's never too late to do the right thing, even if it is for self interested reasons.
@fitsnews Kavanaugh a Centrist? 😂😂😂
@wrthomasson Maybe if he is going to write a book?   I can't imagine what type of job he could get after his sentence is over.  He'll be at least 55 looking for a new line of work, if he serves the full three years.
@LaneKingsbery @MichaelAvenatti Possibly.  I can't imagine who might want to hire an attorney that broke the law and ended up in jail.  His better bet might to be writing a book.
@MichaelAvenatti He has nothing to lose.  He is going to jail for three years.  Has already been sentenced.  What does he have to gain at this point?
@fitsnews Do you believe his evangelical base would have voted for him, knowing he was paying hush money?  Or maybe if those stories were published?  His attorney who coordinated the hush money is now serving time for it.  		Cohen's ABC interview is interesting ...
@fitsnews @realDonaldTrump @BillClinton It isn't about Trump's sexcapades as much as it is his willful intent to break the law in an effort to change the outcome an election and the multitude of lies he spews daily.  I'd say this is bigger than Watergate, but I'm more interested in Mueller's report v speculation.
@realDonaldTrump I though YOU were going to carry the mantle to for a government shut down and not blame anyone.  Wasn't that just yesterday?
@RealBuzMartin @realDonaldTrump Why anyone listens to the vitriol that Coulter constantly spews is beyond me.

@realDonaldTrump Justice will be served.
@BillKristol Who wants stand close to him now?
@TeaPainUSA I believe he will be impeached, because he knows if he resigns it is very likely he will be indicted.  Losing 2020 isn't an option he wants to consider, because again, he could and likely would be indicted.  From where he sits, the only good option is POTUS through 2024.
@StevenTDennis There has never been a President so blatantly corrupt.
@neal_katyal He's also keenly aware that many are waiting for the final Mueller report, before strong talks of impeachment, due to perception of his loyal base that there's a group of people out to get him. He stokes it, breeds more conspiracy &amp; attempts to shift blame out of desperation.

@realDonaldTrump NO ONE spends as much time declaring their innocence and spouting off hateful mean things to the world, simply because they are innocent. NO ONE ever.  I don't know what you have done, but with all my being, I believe you are guilty as the sins you never asked forgiveness for.
@realDonaldTrump You need help.  You are ill and unfit for the office you serve.
@justinamash You are likely the ONLY Freedom/Liberty type Representative that I still respect in US Congress.  The rest have proven they really don't give a care about the constitution nor US for that matter.
@MegKinnardAP @JSCollinsAP I don't blame the homeowner, I would have done the same if I thought quick enough.  		But ...someone should create an infinite loop graph - from drugs - to prison - to death.  And all the off shoots in between.  		Rehabilitation, not incarceration.
@MPowersNorrell @JamesSmithSC Congratulations!!!
@realDonaldTrump Can someone please explain to President Trump that tariffs are a tax and all those billions filling the government coffers are paid by none other than Americans.

@ScottElliotG @RyanLEllis Right now, what I do know, insurance companies are covering less, deductibles higher and OOP expenses ridiculous and premiums outrageous. We don't know we are paying until after the fact.  I like the idea of leveraging buying power to reduce administration costs and lower debt.
@ScottElliotG I like Public Option.  It lowers debt and gives the opportunity to buy into Medicare.

@collins_neal You do a great job!  Proud to call you my Representative.
@realDonaldTrump Do something Obama couldn't do.  Put Public Option on the table and get it passed.  Allow us to buy into Medicare!
@realDonaldTrump With all due respect - that is horse sh*t!  My husband has a pre-existing condition and since you were elected the insurance companies no longer want to cover doctor prescribed medication.  Have a couple friends going through the same thing!

@wwwojtekk @kpomerleau To make a correction on previous - it was disbursement after 52% of profits and three full months of expenses.  We had to have a pad or risk losing it all.
@wwwojtekk @kpomerleau 3/ Ironically, the biggest tax breaks came when we sold the business. The small business incentive is to grow big enough to sell to big corporation.  (End of rant ;))
@wwwojtekk @kpomerleau 2/ Starting a new business, it was not uncommon for employees to have a higher salary than owners.  And especially owner's wife ;)
@wwwojtekk @kpomerleau 1/That's a trick question - we were wage earners, we just worked REALLY long hours. The pass through taxes all profits, distributed and undistributed.  A much bigger deal starting up v once established.  I calculated disbursement after 52% of profits to cover taxes.
@josephlawler My thoughts exactly!
@ScottElliotG I am viewing this through the lens of stock market capital gains, but if we were taxed on unrealized capital gains, that is a whole lot of investor risk. Already paying taxes on capital gains, dividends and investor fees. As oldest GenX our portfolio is retirement planning.

@Voters4Kasich @LindseyGrahamSC @votejohnwarren @henrymcmaster Yeah, I am certainly not ready to rally behind party of all things crazy!
@wesleydonehue @collins_neal It may not be the world we live in right now, but last night demonstrated it is in our community.  #PickensUnited
@MaryCaitlinByrd Good Morning to you!
@cslick803 @JamesSmithSC @MPowersNorrell I'm with you!  Now that the run-offs are over, I am ready to remove the signs for my Republican State House Representative and see about getting signs to support @JamesSmithSC and @MPowersNorrell.  My Pickens neighbors are sure to be confused :)
@wesleydonehue I've wondered the same thing.  Is he planning to use it to help someone else campaign?  I was a little surprised he didn't spend more for his own campaign, and I didn't even know about the extra MIL from his gubernatorial account.
@postandcourier I am not sure if this is on your end or FB?  I tried to copy/paste article on FB and it displays preview not available "attempting to access website from a country ..."  My IP address is Greenville, SC.  Not sure why I am getting that msg.
@gumbo_goddess I have thinned mine a couple times, but they are still loaded with peaches. They started to ripen past couple weeks. It's also an odd year in the garden.  Corn looks like it will be ready to pick before tomatoes!
@gumbo_goddess Thought of you when we picked our first peach this year.  It was almost as big as the one you had last year.  Great year for peaches.
@realDonaldTrump Please.  FFS stop Tweeting this divisive BS.  It would make it much easier to give you credit and thank you for keeping families together.  If only you had a damn pause button.
@wkpixley1 @wrthomasson I'd have to see those clearly defined and fairly broad exceptions, but I might agree :)
@wkpixley1 @wrthomasson It is, but I believe it is a decision best left to doctor patient. Women don't knowingly carry babies to 3rd trimester with intent of abortion. Who would do that? There are cases that involve women's health that could accidentally induce labor and lead to premature death.
@wkpixley1 @wrthomasson What about all healthcare choices left to the doctor's discretion?  Then I might agree.  I believe the abortion issue is about as good as it is going to get, unless we add education to the mix.  Legislation isn't going to fix it, but could make women's health worse.
@wkpixley1 @wrthomasson The issue with exceptions, ever tried to get a much needed medicine on the "exception" list?  Unless you have a lot of money, the wait could kill you.  I don't even want to think of what limiting such medication or treatment could mean.
@wkpixley1 @wrthomasson Ha!  I fully agree with with BC and education.  While I am pro-life. I prefer to leave those decisions between a doctor/patient.  Too many unknowns to reasonably legislate.
@wkpixley1 @wrthomasson I am about as pro-life as they come in my personal life. I had a complicated pregnancy late in life and never considered abortion an option. I also don't consider taking away women's healthcare a solution for young women. Binary legislation isn't appealing.  At all.
@wkpixley1 @wrthomasson I like that idea.
@wkpixley1 @wrthomasson RP = Ron Paul
@wkpixley1 @wrthomasson Are these rules drafted anywhere?
@wkpixley1 @wrthomasson I do absolutely wish LP the very best in building their party.  Maybe then the Republican Party will return to reasonable sense.
@wkpixley1 @wrthomasson Yeah - that isn't what LP believe.  I know.  Headed up many forums for RP only to turn around and campaign against him. They don't believe in safety nets. Their isolationists policies are a bit harsh for me, and the rampant anarchy - a bridge too far.
@wkpixley1 @wrthomasson And BTW what does "modified" mean?  :)
@wkpixley1 @wrthomasson There is NOTHING center about LP - it is extreme fringe.  Been there done that.  If you don't like Trump, can't imagine you'd like LP.  Both are about destroying institutions/infrastructure.
@wkpixley1 @wrthomasson I disagree. On the social side, I lean libertarian. On fiscal side, unless there is a major reboot - no way!  I can relate to classical liberal, but today it means an entirely different thing. I have tried on LP - nope, nope, and nope again.  I'd switch to Democrat first.
@wrthomasson @wkpixley1 To be fair, this is a libertarian wet dream. I am hoping for a happy ending. One where they do have their own party &amp; stop squatting in the R Party. I would argue Trump won the Republican vote in part, due to Anarchist branch of LP.  Build them a home!
@wrthomasson Can you elaborate on that caption?  Or do you understand my larger point. I initially considered voting Johnson/Weld.  However, both "Republicans" choked and Weld suggested a vote for Hillary.  I voted Hillary.  And you want to blame the Center 🤔
@travis_parrett @theworldofjobu @frequentbuyer1 @wrthomasson @SmallBiz4Kasich @jleeannis @lizzyvoice @wkpixley1 I recall Johnson/Weld working to get on the ballot in a couple states, but when I search on LP - it shows they are recognized in all states.  I also recall Weld telling people to vote for Hillary LOL.  Working to get on the ballot in all states v a couple - BIG difference IMO.
@travis_parrett @theworldofjobu @frequentbuyer1 @wrthomasson @SmallBiz4Kasich @jleeannis @lizzyvoice @wkpixley1 I like that idea, but an Independent revolt - how do they even get on the ballot.  Go to every state and get signatures?  Or ... rebrand the LP.  The only 3rd party that is on the ballot in all states that I am aware of.
@MrBrigh21239717 @swestes29 @RealCandaceO Mr. Brightside your Twitter account resembles a fake power troll. Account is fairly recent, you delete Tweets, and your following has increased by rapidly since yesterday.  Over two hundred NEW followers since yesterday.  Over 700 in just a couple weeks.
@realDonaldTrump Where do you get these half baked numbers?  It's everything from tax policy, to trade and now crime in Germany.  Do you just randomly pick a number that might fit a narrative?  I have NO confidence in what you say, you aren't truthful.
Show your support for sending independent thinkers to DC.  Click below and help him win! https://t.co/5zIDBxv2hl
@upstateislander @RepJeffDuncan I believe many constituents, including some like myself who have voted for Duncan in the past, have given up on him taking the lead on anything that he doesn't personally benefit from.  Time to change that.  Vote @MaryGeren.
@realDonaldTrump Just fix it! End the family separation policy.
@realDonaldTrump You own it!  Stop trying to blame the Democrats and just freaking fix it. We are sick of your lies and blame shifting.
@masonfacon @vlazlo2020 @BillKristol And good candidates.  Maybe now that the Anarchists have moved on over to the Party of Trump, the libertarians can work on cleaning up their brand and marketing.  I do foresee one lil problem - the BIG L takeover.
@vlazlo2020 @BillKristol It is likely a question as to whether LP is the direction to move. It's the only 3rd party registered in all states that I am aware of.  Creating a new party is a lot of time, effort and money.
@BillKristol It's all about loyalty.  He's trying to win them over with flattery, in exchange for loyalty.

@ShillForLiberty @MattLoweDesigns @realDonaldTrump I dispute your dispute 😂
@realDonaldTrump What are YOU afraid of? So afraid that you attack DOJ and the free press with your Twitter finger frequently.  Are you the leaker? Sure seems all leaks lead back to you.  I've never witnessed a more corrupt administration in my voting years!
@AlanMCole None of us outsiders are experts on foreign policy. It is too complex and due to sensitive nature, we don't have enough of the pieces to make a real educated guess.  I consider you very smart - you recognize what you do know and also what you don't.
@ScottElliotG What are your opinions that interest on debt will exceed military spending in the very near future?  Agree or disagree and why?
@ScottElliotG While I like tax cuts as much as the next person - I would really have preferred they not be so deep, particularly when married up to trade wars and protectionism.  Debt IMO is a deferred tax.
@ScottElliotG There is a pretty big difference from where I sit in 25% corporate tax rate and a 21%. I would have preferred a 28% that did allow full expensing for small business, Middle Class Tax Cuts and not predicated on deficit spending.  We've also learned some lessons since then - KS/OK
@Voters4Kasich The person based on their platform.
@CGasparino @michelleisawolf Looks like she worked there &amp; due to financial struggle they ended up selling to JPMorgan. I believe a lot of what she said was witty sarcasm that was missed by some &amp; a humorous a display of the crudeness we've all witnessed since pre-election. I thought she was hilarious!
@morningmika I thought she was absolutely hilarious!  I did not view it as personal attacks on anyone's looks, but a witty if uncomfortable way of saying, she burns facts and uses them to her advantage.  Press comments certainly sounded like playful sarcasm based on what Trump has said.
@ScottElliotG 😂😂😂
@cslick803 Sad, but true.  Many will only care when it affects them or someone they love.
@CGasparino It will draw attention to corporate tax cuts AND debt.  IMO
@ScottElliotG I believe the reason people are upset about the tax cuts - it isn't the Middle Class income tax cut promised.  Full expensing of small equipment expires in 2022.  Other tax cuts expire 2025. Most important to me, the debt is growing and projected to continue.
@tedlieu @NRA 😂😂😂

@Voters4Kasich @CameronVentura @SmallBiz4Kasich @wrthomasson @RepMikePitts This is ridiculous.  I am sure someone on the budget committee might tell members of the House/Senate that SC is very reliant on FG for funding. They might also refer them to the Case Texas v. White.  Odds of secession:  Zero.

@CGasparino Based on that experience, I have a tendency to believe Federal Reserve Chair has a lot of influence on consumer confidence, which I strongly believe, influences the stock market.
@CGasparino I had a lot to say. I watched the stock market like a hawk. More specifically Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan at the time. I listened to people wringing their hands about selling retirement stocks. We held and doubled down. We got our money back and then some. 2/
@CGasparino No expert on the stock market. However, I remember the dotcom bust. We were using the stock market as a savings for down payment on house. When stocks doubled in price, my gut screamed sell, but I said nothing to hubby. When our lil investment shrunk to about 1/4 of that ...1/
@PuddnHaid We've elevated a self entitled, rich, spoiled brat, to the highest office in the land. He sows division, chaos and 'deep state' conspiracy in two syllables or less. Plays political football with his lil hands. And pouts on Twitter when he's called out on it. Worst POTUS ever!

@CGasparino Never did I dream I would say this, but ... the Republican Party did give us Trump.  I'd prefer a well educated person, who once held a security clearance, &amp; had a tax plan that paid for itself v. some narcissistic, divisive blowhard that couldn't possibly EVER get cleared.  IMHO

@ScottElliotG You are an example of an underpaid Millennial.  Wow!  You have a degree from Yale and assuming you are not married, that tax rate implies you make less than 40k per year. I ran numbers based on this years dividends only, well over 2k ... assuming tax at ordinary rate.

@LindseyGrahamSC @SenatorTimScott @RepJeffDuncan As a constituent, I do care about debt. IF tax cuts a must, while at reasonably full employment, 3rd long economic expansion, please consider small business &amp; working class a priority.  No more deferred taxes for my children pls.
@RWPUSA I'm all in on the boot action.
@ScottElliotG I disagree. As a former DOO and wife of small business owner, I have very strong opinions about corporations v. small business.  We paid top rates, while few big corporations do.
@ScottElliotG Counter-Counterpoint:  I notice many voters in SC, who are paying much more attention to deficits and pass through tax cuts.  		As a constituent, I do care about deficits and pass-through tax cuts.
@ScottElliotG 2/ Last I checked, correct me where wrong, but the largest growing sector is services. House bill exempts services from a pass through tax break, including technology services. Both bills add deficit(s) predicated on a balance in 10 years +/-   Deferred tax for future generations
@ScottElliotG 1/ Pls keep pointing it out. 3rd longest economic expansion, no accounting for corporate incentives/subsidies in highest corporate tax rate &amp; reasonably full employment. Seems small business/working class tax cuts would be more beneficial to economic growth.
@ScottElliotG THAT is mind blowing IMO.
@ScottElliotG I know you are a smart guy, but even you now this tax cut to big corporations, while we are at reasonably full employment, is not going to help the working class, but add to the deficit(s) with all the baked in assumptions.

@realDonaldTrump The NYT is so mean to me ... wah wah. I think I'll change some laws. Please stop whining and 'act' like a POTUS @nytimes
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Better question, why are you and your staff so defensive?  No one cares about Hillary anymore.  You own it.

@franpol4 Your articles are spam and virus ridden.  I've clicked on two and both are loaded.
@Jeffrey_gordon How do you rate CNN comments regarding your communications? https://t.co/jCGCPXiifD
@FoxNews @POTUS right after he took a Jefferson quote out of context and made #fakenews claims about Sweden. Interesting cleanup for Spicer
@Braveheart_USA  Shameful subtle suggestion - perspective incognito!  Show me popular on a map.  @Voters4Kasich
@mikescintoshow Then work with us, ALL of us, to bring it back to the center.  Be part of a solution, not the problem.  ;)
@mikescintoshow Insecurity bragging. Strong women not intimidated, nor impressed, with small quips of old cliches. @Voters4Kasich
@mikescintoshow You are using water paint.  Broad stroke.  Running ugly.  @Voters4Kasich @Voters4Kasich
@mikescintoshow @Voters4Kasich @Voters4Kasich U demonstrate humility &amp; sacrifice w/your disabled veteran status &amp; diminish it with 2 lines.

@realDonaldTrump Have you considered - IF the peaceful have nowhere to go, conversion and recruitment might be their only means of survival?
@nikkihaley So very proud of you!  We miss you in SC &lt;3

@mikedebonis I have looked everywhere for this.  Thanks for posting.
RT @mikedebonis: Vote was not on House floor or in House committee but in closed door GOP conference meeting. No roll call is taken.
@mikedebonis ridiculous!
@EricLiptonNYT is there a list of which house members voted for this today?
@AlanMCole Amazon Fire. Also like Netflix.  I order a lot from Amazon, free shipping with Prime. Combined cheaper than cable, no commercials
@AlanMCole  Trump must have gotten his Twitter account back:  suggests a "march on Washington"  		https://t.co/6OtODGXj8C
@FoxNews @MELANIATRUMP and so do all those other immigrants, the majority who have lived in America for more than a decade.  Explain that.
@FoxNews Women R not tools to be abused. We R mothers, wives, homemakers, workers, &amp; business owners. Mess with our cubs &amp; we are warriors!
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton Fox - you were my favorite news source, until 8 years ago.  What happened to fair and balanced?
@collins_neal Another fascinating analysis:  https://t.co/0OuMysYGWM
@collins_neal 10 years dynamic, most conservative estimate, Hillary expands government - Trump increases debt. 		https://t.co/N7Pt08FWsz
@collins_neal Lastly, I believe Trump's plan = Millenial debt w/o benefits. Cuts too deep w/o broadening revenues.
@collins_neal I find this article interesting, esp sources:  		https://t.co/SfVq6ixkqi
@collins_neal Boomers almost guaranteed benefits.  Incentive to mention?  Article reads like confirmation bias, absent economics.
@collins_neal Is this what they call Millenial debt without benefits?
@kpomerleau @taxfoundation Thank you for the reply.  Have a fabulous day!
@kpomerleau @taxfoundation Same with married 50K, 3 kids, $8k in child care costs?

@AlanMCole Cast a Harry Potter spell on your Android.  Nerdy fun!     https://t.co/f9HuYqSWll
@HillaryClinton Unethical &amp; blatant tax avoidance. Expensed losses twice for same item. Akin to duplicate charges for same purchase.
@CuffyMeh We are paying as much and likely more, for health insurance/fees, when compared to average median income in our state. @AlanMCole
@AlanMCole Double dipping losses difficult to explain, unless it is coming out of our bank account or P&amp;L. Like double expense for same item
@AlanMCole I agree unacceptable.  Double dipping losses isn't smart.  It's unethical and a blatant attempt at tax evasion.
@treyinla @mms5048 Alt Right infiltrated Libertarian Party, then Republican Party.  Guard yours well! Democrats could be next. Embarrassing.
@AlanMCole Haley announced she is voting Trump, which is far more interesting ;)

@AlanMCole October surprise. It will matter, but how much.  Not new, but opportune. "Rigged" election counter measures?
@AlanMCole Isn't that what Steve Bannon excels at?
@AlanMCole SC has a low gas tax, a lack of road funding &amp; distrust DOT mgmt.  How should gas tax be used, if not for roads/infrastructure?
@realDonaldTrump Are you looking at those scientific "online" polls? NO ONE believes you won.  You're an embarrassment to GOP

@igorbobic My fav: HC didn't rly mean DT supptrs r a bskt of deplorables. DT didn't rly mean he was going 2 release his tax returns either
@AlanMCole As you might guess, I favor small businesses incorporated.  Thx so much for the response/info.  Enjoy this last debate - ha!
@AlanMCole Follow ur tweets, b/c you r my sons age. I think U share same concerns most Gen X do-future debt/children.  Value ur insight.
@AlanMCole Moderate - bounced ;)
@AlanMCole What would happen if numbers reverse - small tax on small business and not decrease for big?  Curious.
@AlanMCole What I see, no debt reduction, increases likely? Growth unpredictable gamble.  Formula for dynamic growth?
@AlanMCole Do the numbers include a pass-through tax? I'm seeing snapshot comparison.
@AlanMCole We all like tax cuts, but I do not like debt - can you please address how the dynamics of Trump's tax plan affect debt long-term?
@AlanMCole Just so you know, I am a long-term Republican and TF fan, what I read in the numbers is debt for the Millennials (my children)
@AlanMCole Any current numbers on Trump's tax plan? I see debt and a field of dreams, but no "dynamic" numbers based on "current" position.
@taxfoundation @AlanMCole Trump's numbers have changed since Sept, based on debate.  Hillary's are much more current numbers.  Oct v.Sept.
@taxfoundation Do you have one for Trump?
@AlanMCole @rortybomb WV is hard red - why?  Because they believe Trump can bring back coal.  IMHO

@oreillyfactor @SpeakerRyan Women are watching &amp; like it or not, we have a vote.  This election is shameful on so many levels.
@SopanDeb Didn't vote Obama, but he has much more personal integrity than any Trump.
@AlanMCole Economics:  Keynesian, Friedman, et al including Cole  - are objective to econs, subjective to non-econs.
@SopanDeb Right beside him is the KY Gov. saying bloodshed may be necessary.  And these are leaders?
@AlanMCole Would be of great interest to see Tax Foundation to analyze Federal Reserve pros/cons.  What wld America look like w/o?
@AlanMCole You'll be much cooler next election.  Facts do matter.
@AlanMCole Will Trump's policy shift from Audit the Fed, to Abolish the Fed, after he reads this analysis?
@JHWeissmann Anyone else on the ballot.
@AlanMCole Can you state your opinion on which tax plan is better for the economy over the long haul?  It's wicked confusing.
@AlanMCole My concern with Trump - his plan looks like a deficit gamble. Does remind me of KS.
