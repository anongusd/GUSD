Mayor Warren takes oath of office, dedicates 2nd term to achieving economic equality in #ROC https://t.co/SKRJHU6nkl https://t.co/hmHKWlngYf
Mayor Lovely Warren concludes, again quoting MLK: “Because what does it profit a man to be able to eat at an integrated lunch counter if he doesn’t have enough money to buy a hamburger and a cup of coffee?” #warreninauguration17
Mayor Lovely Warren: “It is our obligation to set the stage so that one day the opportunities that we all hold near and dear to our hearts can be realized by every citizen no matter their zip code, background, race, sexual orientation, religion.” #warreninauguration17
Mayor Lovely Warren: “We realize the mission is bigger than one person. Because I know – I know - I cannot do this alone.  I need each and every one of you with me. We must stand together.” #warreninauguration17 https://t.co/BmzeXO4fIB
Mayor Lovely Warren says her administration will continue to invest in Rochester’s people, “So that our city can have social equality … Economic equality … True, genuine equality.” #warreninauguration17
Mayor Warren cites key initiatives: Kiva, VanPool, Bike Share, Beacon Schools, and more. “But like Dr. King and Mr. Wilson, I am not satisfied. My work – our work – is not finished.” #warreninauguration17
Mayor Warren cites accomplishments of first term: The Inner Loop, Midtown, the Charlotte Marina, investments in affordable housing on Main Street, Hudson Avenue and in JOSANA, and more. #warreninauguration17
Mayor Lovely Warren: “On average, women, people of color and citizens with disabilities earn less than their counterparts in the same jobs in nearly every industry... regardless of their educational attainment. That’s just wrong - and that has to stop.” #warreninauguration17 https://t.co/GnF7I8eRON
Mayor Lovely Warren announces plans to confront the injustice of wage disparities, outlined in a recent report by the City’s Office of Innovation and Strategic Initiatives. https://t.co/sWIkEmMtT7 #warreninauguration17 https://t.co/bP23sTcC4F
Mayor Lovely Warren: “And I hope Dr. King and Mr. Wilson would be proud to know that line will not end with me. It will continue right on through my office to future generations.” #warreninauguration17 https://t.co/ryKAl6Pnfh
This led to Ursula Burns becoming the first black woman as a CEO and President of a Fortune 500 company… and then to City Hall, where the daughter of a Xerox employee would later become Mayor of the City of Rochester. #warreninauguration17
Mayor Lovely Warren cites Dr. King’s words in action:  In the 1970s, under Joseph Wilson, Xerox launched an aggressive policy to hire more blacks &amp; support black-owned businesses. Those policies would later include women and other people of color. #warreninauguration17 https://t.co/2i2AeJ9txT
Mayor Lovely Warren quotes Dr. King: “For we know now that it isn’t enough to integrate lunch counters. What does it profit a man to be able to eat at an integrated lunch counter if he doesn’t have enough money to buy a hamburger and a cup of coffee?” #warreninauguration17
Mayor Lovely Warren: “We don’t often talk about this, but in the last years of King’s life, Dr. King started to articulate that civil rights alone does not guarantee freedom.” #warreninauguration17 https://t.co/NJHLVITGbt
Mayor Lovely Warren begins her inauguration speech by quoting some of Martin Luther King, Jr.’s final words: “I am not satisfied. And I want you to be dissatisfied with me. Let us all be dissatisfied, together.” #warreninauguration17 https://t.co/HuzTrc5MAO
Surrounded by family, Mayor Lovely Warren is sworn in for her second term as mayor by her mentor, Assemblyman David Gantt. #warreninauguration17 https://t.co/fR8XQ068at

As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said, “An eye for an eye leaves everybody blind.” #Dallas
Like Mayor Rawlings said, watch your words… we need to use words that will build up, not tear down. #Dallas
I ask all of Rochester to stand by our police officers as they continue to protect and serve, bravely and valiantly. #Dallas
Rochester’s police are among the best in the business, and today we grieve with them as they grieve for their fellow officers. #Dallas
In Rochester we have tried to make inroads by finding ways to build trust between our police and the community they serve. #Dallas
It’s time to insist that action be taken to address gun violence in America, which has taken many lives &amp; altered so many others. #Dallas
Tragedy does not need to beget more tragedy. Understanding &amp; respect are the only answer to these ongoing issues of race &amp; policing. #Dallas
We are gathered here, to stand in unity with the rest of the country, and to pray for Dallas and for all victims of gun violence. #Dallas
The following tweets are quotes from Mayor Lovely A. Warren, reflecting on the #Dallas tragedy.
