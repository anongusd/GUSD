@realDonaldTrump I have also interviewed many people and produced many documents. I haven't colluded either. But I haven't found it either. LOL. Jackass.
@realDonaldTrump Except they have not seen the evidence, haven't finished the investigation, and Mueller has everything.		Oh, and he said direct evidence. You keep changing the scenario for your own propaganda purposes.

@MatrixIsWeak @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Nor do I care who you are. We won't agree. Let us stop the discussion. I'll respect whoever you are and whatever you represent and you do the same with me.
@MatrixIsWeak @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends I've had arguments with people like you. They are either private citizens, semi-autonomous bots who post nothing but political info for purposes pursuant to a political goal, or those idiotic Q people. Not sure which of those you are.
@MatrixIsWeak @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends The first is true. But it doesn't matter. Felonies are felonies. Shows Trump showed poor judgment. Second is just idiotic and you (should) know it.
@MatrixIsWeak @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Chill out dude. Don't you have a sense of humor? Let it go. Obsessing over something as trivial as this on social media with a complete stranger is kind of dumb.
@MatrixIsWeak @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends I don't think anyone in the government involved in the investigation is a traitor. Labelling them as such is deflection and distraction.
@MatrixIsWeak @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends You can't pick and choose your felons. I know people want to hate Mueller for extending the investigation. Starr did the same thing with Clinton, and I'm sure you opposed it then too.........

@realDonaldTrump You fired McCabe because he was investigating you. That is literally the definition of obstruction.		Resign now before you become more (in)famous.

@Conservtve67 @realDonaldTrump It’s unconscionable what politicians do. Both sides.
@Conservtve67 @realDonaldTrump I’m a federal employee. Attacks on my pay and retirement are things I can’t forgive. And this administration has vehemently come after us.
@psychdr100 Apparently God doesn’t exist either.
@Conservtve67 @realDonaldTrump Hello no. I’m just an air traffic controller. But I’m also a realist. I know how things work.
@Conservtve67 @realDonaldTrump We’re a global economy. Considerably more tied together now than in years past. Isolationism doesn’t work anymore. It is what it is.
@Conservtve67 @realDonaldTrump She sucks. So does he. We’re stuck with shit and crap.
@Conservtve67 @realDonaldTrump Trump is one person. I just don’t think he understands how the system works. He is not detail oriented and relies too much on his instincts, which don’t serve him without experience. IMO.
@Conservtve67 @realDonaldTrump If you are being honest, I assume you also opposed the Clinton impeachment when Start went beyond the scope of Whitewater?
@Conservtve67 @realDonaldTrump It was easy to predict based on history that Mueller would end up finding more. It’s allowed under federal law. You might not like it, but if they didn’t do anything wrong you wouldn’t have to worry. 		Politicians are corrupt. Businessmen are corrupt. Trump is both.
@Conservtve67 @realDonaldTrump Yes, but that was only the start. It is beyond the scope. So was Clinton’s impeachment. Starr was tasked to look into Whotewater and ended with Monica. This isn’t remotely uncharted waters.
@Conservtve67 @realDonaldTrump Trump is a nightmare. HRC would have been too, but at least she understands governmental processes.
@Conservtve67 @realDonaldTrump I’ve looked into it. It was approved. The GOP didn’t fight it. The administration approved it. Was it wrong, maybe, but it wasn’t illegal.
@Conservtve67 @realDonaldTrump I’m not foolish enough to see anything. I didn’t create this. The Trump campaign committed multiple felonies. This is without question. I already said Trump probably didn’t collude, but the question of whether others did is still an open question.
@Conservtve67 @realDonaldTrump The sale of uranium was legal and approved. Sorry, but it’s been looked at repeatedly by the GOP. Either it wasn’t wrong or they are really incompetent. Pick your poison.
@Conservtve67 @realDonaldTrump Did his campaign collude? Perhaps. Is Trump responsible for them? Probably. Or at least that would be the military philosophy you and I both wore the uniform for.
@Conservtve67 @realDonaldTrump I don’t think Trump colluded. But he probably did violate campaign finance laws. And he certainly violated ethical and moral standards.
@Conservtve67 @realDonaldTrump Ha. That’s funny. You’re falling for your master’s propaganda. Collusion isn’t the issue and hasn’t been for a long time.
@Conservtve67 @realDonaldTrump I thought it was Vladimir.
@Conservtve67 @realDonaldTrump How many people in the Trump campaign committed a felony again? Asking for 200 million friends.

@realDonaldTrump I'm sure you'll bring up their human rights violations. We all know how important human dignity is to you.
@realDonaldTrump Or maybe someday you'll acknowledge that Russia did actually hack the election and that is the reason why the whole SC was convened.....
@realDonaldTrump A great candidate? How many crimes did your campaign commit?
@realDonaldTrump Collusion isn't your problem anymore, and hasn't been your problem is quite some time.....
@realDonaldTrump How many crimes has your campaign now been found to have committed? Do you have enough fingers to count them or do you need to take your socks off?

@realDonaldTrump For what reason? It’s still a violation of Posse Comitatus.
@realDonaldTrump Apparently your own party is voting on a bill that is a rebuke of your foreign policy.
@arappeport Apparently God is into lying and adultery with porn stars. So much for the Ten Commandments. I guess there is only eight.
@realDonaldTrump Which I guess makes the GOP the party of not caring about kids once they are born, massive borrowing, racism, and adultery with porn stars.
@realDonaldTrump Because a bunch of unarmed families from third world countries are such a threat to a superpower. Process their requests as you would any other and properly vet them. If you have the processes in place, you shouldn't have to worry about legal entry.
@realDonaldTrump Jesus dude. Why even waste time with a shutdown then if you're just going to declare a national emergency? You know as well as I do that it sets a precedent and lets a democrat president do the same thing, plus it'll be challenged for years in court.
@usapride8585 @realDonaldTrump You might also want to look at satire and sarcasm. Facetious as well. Laugh dude. Life is meant to be enjoyed.
@usapride8585 @realDonaldTrump But if you are trying to lure me into some trap of bullying me, you can forget that. I don't deal with bullies. Right or left, doesn't matter, it's still pathetic.
@usapride8585 @realDonaldTrump Why would I do that? You're entitled to your opinion as I am mine. Just because my opinion isn't like yours doesn't make it any less important. Nor does it make yours any less important than mine. It is just an opinion. Entrenched opinion is not fact though.

@Caloparker @JanetGordon54 @brithume BTW, this is only a facetious comment. Not meant to be taken literally or personally.
@Caloparker @JanetGordon54 @brithume I wasn’t sure how to dignify such a stupid statement with any other response. An inordinately idiotic, stupid, ignorant, and gullible statement. 		There, is that better?
@mwhatsnext @CWright60 @JanetGordon54 @brithume Not mine. The government. Trump administration.
@Caloparker @brithume They had an agreement prior to the shutdown.
@Caloparker @JanetGordon54 @brithume You can tell the truth and still not be an asshole. He’s an asshole.
@Caloparker @JanetGordon54 @brithume 😆
Rationalization for the betterment of society can sound good, but can result in moral impairment. Eventually through incremental changes you become gradually acclimated to a certain mindset and increasingly willing to accept conditions you might not otherwise.
@Caloparker @JanetGordon54 @brithume Maybe because of how he acts? Maybe because of what he says? Maybe because of his lack of decorum? Maybe because his own administration continually has to walk back his statements?
@Caloparker @brithume Geeeesh. Maybe he should have said it from the beginning until waiting to shut down the government and screw us out of pay.
@JanetGordon54 @brithume Most illegals don’t commit the crimes that have been alleged. Most drugs don’t come across in-walled sections. But if we can stop the problems, it’s a win. Crime will fall somewhat, but most of our crime is our own citizens. IMO, so take that with a grain of salt.
@JanetGordon54 @brithume Curt, you  are correct. But the DEA has acknowledged most (90%) are smuggled through legal checkpoints. I don’t like the way the wall has been sold to us. I get that they need public support, but stretching the truth is disingenuous.
@mwhatsnext @CWright60 @JanetGordon54 @brithume Not really, but I think they probably have a semi accurate estimate. It’s really just an educated guess.
@CWright60 @JanetGordon54 @brithume The DEA knows. It is their yearly reports. It’s how we know about the problem.
@JanetGordon54 @brithume My issue with Trump’s budget proposal was $5.7 b for the wall, then he backed off and advocated for a holistic approach, with the same amount for the wall and additional funds for other measures. Didn’t make sense to me. Less distance for the same price?
@JanetGordon54 @brithume I’m a little bitter about the whole concept, and the level of hate the right threw at us and despicable comments was a little wearing.
@JanetGordon54 @brithume No. The Wall isn’t the most important part of border security, but it’s all you people want to talk about. I even took 35 days of unpaid work for the stupid thing.
@JimmyWe58329038 @realDonaldTrump They have been publicly acknowledged.
@JanetGordon54 @brithume I suppose you also think Brit is being obtuse since we both said the same thing. Or is it because I’m not a Trump fan?
@JanetGordon54 @brithume That’s not being obtuse. Just looking at other solutions and thinking of the entire problem. Checkpoints are a huge problem. That’s where most of the drugs are smuggled. Already has a barrier and security, but both are problematic. Needs improvement.
@JanetGordon54 @brithume The Wall has considerable problems. A holistic approach to border security is a far better solution than one barrier that isn’t completely viable as originally presented.
@franks_3111 @brithume It’s a good thing. The wall isn’t viable in some regards. Has environmental problems (Big Bend of TX), cultural issues (tribal land), and eminent domain impediments (Youngstown Tube vs Swwyer SCOTUS).
@realDonaldTrump Getting your foreign intelligence briefing from Fox and Friends again I see......
@AOC Normalizing racism and deeming it acceptable is despicable. Trump has hurt this country.
@brithume Trump may try to deny it, but there are other methods that, when combined with portions of a barrier and used in areas where the barrier is not feasible, are perfectly viable.

@Debj541 @realDonaldTrump @DougWead It's bad enough when 800,000 of us go without pay, but there are nearly 23 million households on food stamps.
@DavidChouinard2 @emmaline1221 @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump The House passed the funding bills. Four of them were blocked by Mitch on the Senate side. Sounds like someone doesn't want the government open all right.
@DavidChouinard2 @onemangang35 @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump Don't tell me I should be forced to work for free. I've worked 200 hours and have yet to be paid for any of them. That is contrary to everything this country stands for, especially the GOP focus on business. Federal workers are having to use public assistance programs.
@DavidChouinard2 @onemangang35 @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump I do. This isn't an emergency. It's a created situation. Don't tell me it's raining and then piss on my head.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends The shutdown is killing growth, at a rate of .4% and increasing per week. Twice what your administration estimated.
@realDonaldTrump @DougWead How ironic is it that food stamps are about to stop because of the Trump shutdown....
@realDonaldTrump @DougWead Job? 800,000 of us aren't getting paid.

@tedcruz @realDonaldTrump He doesn't have to give it in the Capital Building at all. Prior to Wilson, it was written out. We can all read. He can just tweet it if he wants. In bits.
@eatkinson48 @kirkacevedo @ananavarro @LaraLeaTrump The problem exists on the Senate side.
@Reasonableist @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump I don't have an issue with Trump giving a national address. Neither should Pelosi. Neither of them should for the other. But I don't really care if he addresses Congress or not. I really just want a paycheck at this point. A month of work without pay is a bit much.
@historBilia @RepDanCrenshaw I think they gravitate toward the party line. And they feel forced to accomodate and conform because of party pressure.
@bookheart @KbjoneKaren @5150forSports @kirkacevedo @ananavarro @LaraLeaTrump She lacks the ability to understand because of a lack of empathy and because she has never had to live the life most of us have had to: i.e. working for a living, aka having a job.
@historBilia @RepDanCrenshaw I had hopes for him. He seemed to come from a moderate responsibility position.
@Reasonableist @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Bush didn't use it after 9/11? I guess that a request from the President to address both houses is usually deemed to be just that, a request. But in light of whatever event precipitated it, it is usually agreed upon.
@RepDavid Please, just reopen the government. I'm an air traffic controller and work much of the traffic in southern Arizona. I haven't been paid in a month.
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump It says 'on extraordinary occasions.' I think each side disagrees regarding whether this meets that criteria. Traditionally, I believe it has only been utilized for declarations of war and crisis events like 9/11.

@Carrie_Kelly17 @kirkacevedo @ananavarro @LaraLeaTrump What does CR stand for?
@Carrie_Kelly17 @kirkacevedo @ananavarro @LaraLeaTrump Because that IS the CR.
@Carrie_Kelly17 @kirkacevedo @ananavarro @LaraLeaTrump A clean CR lets them get everyone back to work. IRS can process tax refunds. Assistance payments go out. Federal courts don't close. TSA goes back to work before the agency collapses. And both sides can still hash out details of another spending bill for border security.
@Carrie_Kelly17 @kirkacevedo @ananavarro @LaraLeaTrump That backpay bill already passed. In order to pass a bill to pay us, the House has to have an authorization bill, which has already passed. Both sides need a clean CR. House did it. Mitch is blocking it.
@RepDanCrenshaw Except you are conveniently ignoring the 10 bills that did pass, and the four bills McConnell blocked on the Senate side. Only one bill needs to pass, a clean CR that gets everyone back to work and still allows you guys to talk. Simple process.
@Carrie_Kelly17 @kirkacevedo @ananavarro @LaraLeaTrump They could have. But the tweet he sent is disingenuous. It ignored all of then others bills that were passed and McConnell blocking them in the Senate. They only need one bill in the Senate to pass and reopen the government.
@Carrie_Kelly17 @kirkacevedo @ananavarro @LaraLeaTrump The House has voted on 10 spending bills. This was just one of them. Most have passed. However, Mitch McConnell has now blocked four bills in the Senate from going to the floor for a vote. Reopening the government and paying us is simple. The process is simple.

@KbjoneKaren @5150forSports @kirkacevedo @ananavarro @LaraLeaTrump It's easy to say when you are worth millions of dollars. The rest of work for a living and contribute a hell of a lot more to society and the nation.
@IwantLuLu @ananavarro Semantics probably. I guess I differentiate between those who are going to be paid as if they worked and those who will have worked the time. Personally I have no problem with furloughed workers getting paid because they shouldn't have to pay a price for politics.
On the plus side, due to a very limited grocery budget and diet, I am losing weight. But maybe that's also because I've been sick for two weeks. #NoGoodCanComeOutOfThis #EndTheShutdown
@LazyCircles @kirkacevedo @ananavarro @LaraLeaTrump @senatemajldr Other than Trump as the primary culprit of this debacle (by his own admission, which his base forgot about already), I think Mitch shares equal blame. He has blocked bills that he knows Trump won't sign to save him from having to veto them and subsequent blame for the shutdown.
@LittleCastle49 @kirkacevedo @ananavarro @LaraLeaTrump I actually think the notion of the Wall isn't particularly viable because of eminent domain problems (Youngstown Tube SCOTUS), environmental issues (Big Bend of TX), and cultural impacts (several Native Tribes).

@MichaelScotlan4 @nevancik1 @kirkacevedo @ananavarro @LaraLeaTrump At a minimum I would need to be approved for annual leave, which would then be converted to furlough. And getting off the schedule for my facility is nearly impossible because of how short we are.
@TurdFergusonUSA @kirkacevedo @ananavarro @LaraLeaTrump That's also illegal. Job actions (stoppages, slow downs, sick outs, strikes etc) are a violation of federal law for federal employees. I've been ordered to go to work.

@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews It's not even remotely unconstitutional. If it was, you going to Wikileaks and the Russians for dirt on Hillary would also be illegal.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews The Senate and everyone else has looked into the dossier. While not confirmed, it has also not been refuted. Nothing about it is illegal, just because you don't like it.

@realDonaldTrump Well, this is a good step. You finally admit that you call the media fake because you don't like the coverage.

@legend_f22 @Patriot94557050 @charliekirk11 Not all of it was false. Much isn't all. But you can take this story for whatever you want. https://t.co/zqg6rKcsBU
@Patriot94557050 @charliekirk11 Both sides did.
@Patriot94557050 @charliekirk11 There are a lot of positions in federal service that honor the commitment in ADA.
@Patriot94557050 @charliekirk11 By all means, enlist. Or join federal service. You’re a patriot, right?
@Patriot94557050 @charliekirk11 Guess what kiddo. I served in uniform in the USAF. I continue to serve the nation. For 25 years. Now I do it without pay. Please tell me what you have done to be a patriot. 94557050.
@jack66123366 @Patriot94557050 @charliekirk11 Don’t impugn the right.
@jack66123366 @Patriot94557050 @charliekirk11 No, I agree. But just because you don’t agree doesn’t mean you can put them all in front of a firing squad.
@JonesShanna @charliekirk11 I’m well aware Trump has a serious problem with the media, but it is largely because of his inability to accept criticism. The rest of you accept it as gospel and that is concerning.
@Patriot94557050 @charliekirk11 It’s opinion. But the media is a necessary part of our democracy. Attempts to dissuade from that are beyond disconcerting. See Nazi Germany for history relevance.
@Patriot94557050 @charliekirk11 The first has nothing to do with lying. It has to do with freedom of speech. Just because you don’t like it doesn’t give you license to kill it. Disagreement doesn’t make it a lie.

@charliekirk11 Anyone with any common sense and basic legislative knowledge knows that the Senate can just vote it down. First, 53 Republicans in the Senate, second, they need 60 votes for a funding bill anyway. So your blame of Democrats is fallacious. So calm down chuckles and get a job.
5. Trump signs it. Federal employees get paid and the economy can start to pick back up.	6. You all grow up and do your job.
Here is my counter proposal for both parties	1. The leaders of both parties from both the Senate and House meet in a private room Monday morning at 8 am. Trump is NOT allowed in. 	2. You start. 	3. We lock the doors and you work out a deal. 	4. You can leave when it is finished.
Democrats, jump on it. Deal the $5.7 billion and shore up border security where it is needed.
OK, I watched his speech. While I am obviously biased because I REALLY need to get a paycheck, I think if Trump had sold these plan 29 days ago we wouldn’t be in this mess. It sounds reasonable at face value and allows for more time to fix the greater issues.
Stop holding us hostage. We're not your pawns. We should NEVER be used as fucking leverage.	Grow the fuck up.
Ok, so the speech had concessions and made some sense (although it's not the crisis he is making it out to be). But he didn't say one fucking word about all of us working for free and being furloughed.

@puttytat58 @KellyannePolls Quit making excuses for him.
@puttytat58 @KellyannePolls There was a crime. Russian hack of the election. The fact that it led to potential obstruction and campaign finance problems is only the fault of those responsible.

@puttytat58 @KellyannePolls Oh, I don’t think you are going for a ride. I am. I’m not getting paid for your leader. Trump is certainly in for a ride. I hope he didn’t do anything wrong, but somehow I suspect he did.
@Robert122263 @maxxx__power @scottbutner @parscale @realDonaldTrump @CNN @MSNBC Six bankruptcies is not an indication of success. Failure, diligence, persistence, stubbornness perhaps. People continuing to extend credit and opportunity. My opinion only, but I also think Trump is an immoral narcissistic.
@puttytat58 @KellyannePolls It is interesting that Buzzfeed was given information that turned out to be inaccurate. I wonder who intentionally did that, given their history with the dossier.
@puttytat58 @KellyannePolls I think the use of the term inaccurate versus wrong, incorrect, etc implies a level of truth while elements are also inaccurate. My opinion only. You don’t have to share it, but that is also your opinion and right. No need to argue about an opinion. It’s kind of useless.
@puttytat58 @KellyannePolls Even the B Clinton SC started as something else until it resulted in his impeachment. It is common and was predicted. If Trump didn’t do anything wrong he has nothing to worry about. If he did, then the SC will find it. Not their fault. It’s his. No one else’s.
@puttytat58 @KellyannePolls It was created to look at Russian meddling. I think we can all agree that needed to be examined and mitigated.
@puttytat58 @KellyannePolls The scope under law allows considerable leeway. You might not like, but it is what it is. I’ll bet you loved the B Clinton SC investigation.
@puttytat58 @KellyannePolls Notice I said possibly and probably. Because neither you nor I know.
@puttytat58 @KellyannePolls Faulty. Not accurate. Let me give you an instance. You tell a story and someone says it is not accurate. Usually implies that portions of the story occurred, but not in the way implied. Trump probably didn’t order Cohen to lie. But the rest is possibly truth.

@realDonaldTrump @newtgingrich I doubt Obama and Fox News would agree. But whatever. Your coverage in the press should be the least of your worries.
@realDonaldTrump We keep saying it, just because you don't like it doesn't make it fake news.
@realDonaldTrump Wrong, the dossier was not the impetus for the probe, the Russian hack of the election was. The one you keep trying to deny happened for some reason.

@ViQueen55 @jhtolatc @RadarCornflakes @rustysunshine @atclew58 And, all the ones who support that crap are non dues paying.
@ViQueen55 @jhtolatc @RadarCornflakes @rustysunshine @atclew58 Most everyone in my facility doesn’t support the wall. Virtually no one supports the shutdown. One did, but now he is broke. Funny how that shit happens.
@jamesheath @atclew58 @rustysunshine @ViQueen55 I don’t either. I’m worried because they are our future. We finally have a decent group of trainees (at least in my facility), and the gov’t is fucking it up.
@atclew58 @ViQueen55 @rustysunshine I remember 18 on the day shift. Before RVSM, no 4th line, no URET.
@ViQueen55 @atclew58 @rustysunshine We raised our day shift number to 11. We open 6 sectors, often 7, sometimes 8. And train. And go red without D sides. I’m sick of getting my ass kicked with no help.
@RadarCornflakes @rustysunshine @ViQueen55 @atclew58 I would guess that to be reasonably accurate. If it goes on much longer, definitely.
@ViQueen55 @atclew58 @rustysunshine I’m eligible in 3 years and 6 months. My replacement should already be in the pipeline. But, nope. They furloughed everyone and suspended hiring. Assholes.

My prediction: Trump will use executive presidential emergency powers to shift money to build the wall. It will be instantly challenged in court and not be built. He will be hailed a hero by his base for not giving in,......
@brianstelter SC said the report is not accurate. They did NOT say the report was wrong. Perhaps semantics, but very important semantics. 		The SC statement was very carefully crafted.

@HMMTLZ1 @GOP @realDonaldTrump I'm just not sure it is viable at the moment in the measures proposed by the administration. Definitely can be improved upon though, particularly in TX. But the biggest illegal crossing points aren't in TX.
@HMMTLZ1 @GOP @realDonaldTrump I'm not opposed to the barrier, but there are considerable environment, cultural, and legal impediments. Environmental particularly in the Big Bend of TX, cultural along the AZ border with the tribes, and legal with eminent domain which was struck down in 1952.
@HMMTLZ1 @GOP @realDonaldTrump 90%, but you can rationalize it however you want. His Wall won't stop the drugs to any degree. Holistic improvement is what he should be trying to accomplish, and he could have swung most Americans around to his argument if he had tried that.

@starsnstripes79 @GOP @realDonaldTrump We had a rancher in my airspace in AZ who was being paid by the FAA for the use of his land for a NAVAID. A lot of money. He was losing money because of space he had to reserve for it and stopped cooperating. I wonder how much other ranchers would do the same.
@starsnstripes79 @GOP @realDonaldTrump It was successfully challenged in a SCOTUS case in 1947. I don’t think the administration would win it again.  It would be in court for years. https://t.co/qOZPI68OKm
@starsnstripes79 @GOP @realDonaldTrump I think the concept of something paying for itself is a misnomer. It doesn’t pay for itself. We still have to foot the bill. We save money in one avenue, but it is still spent elesewhere. We aren’t recouping money at all.
@starsnstripes79 @GOP @realDonaldTrump Most drugs don’t come across at unpopulated points. The vast majority are smuggled through legal checkpoints. I don’t think a barrier should be the sole goal of improvement. It’s my biggest gripe in the argument. Other than screwing employees over.
@starsnstripes79 @GOP @realDonaldTrump Any little bit helps. But across the board and not one single thing. More than just a barrier.
@starsnstripes79 @GOP @realDonaldTrump I agree. Some of the other numbers quoted aren’t accurate though. Most of the drugs smuggled across are done so at legal checkpoints. And most illegals don’t commit crimes, other than the obvious one of crossing. To some extent it’s fear mongering to elicit support.
@realDonaldTrump So you’re going to a rally convention but yet have the gall to rip Democrats going to Puerto Rico for their job?
https://t.co/J7tZN0worv
@starsnstripes79 @GOP @realDonaldTrump I’m not sure the administration has gone through the process of viability examination. Not talking efficacy, just whether it is even possible to build the darn thing in total. Portions, definitely.
@starsnstripes79 @GOP @realDonaldTrump I agree with the need for a barrier. But part of the border has significant problems with building one, especially in TX where there isn’t one. Eminent domain is also a problem that cannot be overcome based on legal precedent.
@starsnstripes79 @GOP @realDonaldTrump The borders are fairly secure. Apprehensions are up and border crossings are down. I agree it’s a problem, just not to the magnitude portrayed. 3.3% of Americans ate incarcerated, but only 1.7% of immigrants.
@MikeDelMoro Drudge AND Rasmussen? Last I saw Rasmussen had him at 44 or 45%. But they’ll just say it is fake news. That’s what they do when they don’t like something.

@starsnstripes79 @GOP @realDonaldTrump Lastly, we should NEVER have to ask our families for money, rely on credit, take out a loan, or apply for welfare because of a partisan fight.
@starsnstripes79 @GOP @realDonaldTrump Besides, both parties had a compromise on this. Trump caved to pressure and the GOP balked because they know if he vetoes it he gets sole blame. Democrats need to give some leeway, but so does the GOP. Both parties are to blame. Regardless of what you want to think.
@starsnstripes79 @GOP @realDonaldTrump No. My problem is holding federal employees hostage. I wasn’t ok with it in 2013 and I’m not ok with it now. It doesn’t matter which party it is.

@realDonaldTrump According to you without a Wall the border is not even remotely secured. So, what have you been doing for two years? Sounds like you are incompetent.

@Think51783608 @charliekirk11 Schumer is as much of an ass as Trump. Schumer, Pelosi, Trump share responsibly. McConnell probably more since he is unwilling to bring a bill to the Senate that he thinks Trump will veto. It’s protectionist I think.
@Think51783608 @charliekirk11 Like I said, I am not opposed to the wall just the shutdown. They can reach a compromise. It might not be what you want, but they have to have some middle ground, a compromise, or trade. Long term the entire government will be crippled and the economy will collapse.
@Think51783608 @charliekirk11 Rumor has it they are going to give DACA for full funding. That should be interesting.
@Think51783608 @charliekirk11 No. They had a compromise right before the shutdown. Trump backed down because it wasn’t what he wanted. It was more than the Democrats wanted to give. Now each side is just being stubborn instead of going back to talking.

@Think51783608 @charliekirk11 My argument is not wall related. It’s employee related. Nothing more. At least until the shutdown is over. Then the debate can ensue. I suspect they’ll end up at either a middle ground or a trade of some sort.
@Think51783608 @charliekirk11 Like I said, I’m not opposed to security and a barrier. It makes sense. I just don’t want them using federal employees as pawns. That applies to both sides.

@trencher69 @JoeStan41634540 @seanhannity Agreed, but that was Congress. Trump likes to take credit for things he shouldn't because he craves adulation. Like he is trying to say he's going to back pay us federal workers for the furlough, when it is Congress who authorizes it.

@realDonaldTrump The barrier was built, about a third of the border already has it, although part of that is just vehicle obstructions. Improvements can be made, we all know that, but not just some arbitrary plan to build something. You need to give us more details and better rationale.

The ironic thing is that the shutdown served to distract from Mueller, and Trump exercising emergency powers will put us all back to work and refocus attention back on Mueller.
I also think he is trying to set precedent for extensions of executive power when he tries to bury the Mueller report.
@charliekirk11 Both sides ask that of the other. Both questions to the other side are legitimate.

@FrznShrew @drCoker80 @charliekirk11 National Guard is slightly different because they are under the jurisdiction of the state and governor.
@FrznShrew @drCoker80 @charliekirk11 A national emergency is one thing, but civilian agencies are only allowed to apprehend. It’s illegal for the military to be used for law enforcement, regardless of any declaration. Other agencies can definitely do that though. It’s a good thing.
@realDonaldTrump Maybe it has something to do with the biggest budget deficit in decades because of the tax policy?
@realDonaldTrump Foreign aid amounts to about $50 billion, which is only about 1% of the budget.
@realDonaldTrump You want 5 billion for the wall, but you spent 12 billion to bail out farmers because of your tariffs.
@realDonaldTrump Wow, with those numbers, are you saying your current methods are working?
@realDonaldTrump That first sentence should tell everyone exactly what kind of person you are.
@realDonaldTrump Every time you try to deny something most of us know it’s utter bullshit. The more you deny the more guilty you tend to be.
@realDonaldTrump There is a difference between a civil penalty for inadvertent violations and intentionally violating the law. One is civil, one is criminal. But the fact that you have to say it isn’t a big deal is very telling.
@realDonaldTrump You can also end the shutdown by compromising for a short term funding solution that improves border security and working on a longer term solution. But you ‘don’t want to look foolish.’ Too late for that.
@realDonaldTrump Isn’t Fox News also a fake source?
@realDonaldTrump Pretty desperate that you have to use him for praise.
@realDonaldTrump You don’t care about us federal employees. We know that already.
I think I figured out why Trump said Mexico would pay for the wall. New Mexico has one of the highest percentages of the state’s population who are federal employees. We are all working without pay or furloughed. He got mixed up about Mexico and New Mexico. Dilemma solved.
@FrznShrew @drCoker80 @charliekirk11 I think it still violates Posse Comitatus. He can use them for border security, but they can’t arrest anyone coming across the border illegally.
@FrznShrew @drCoker80 @charliekirk11 I don’t have a problem with border security. However, it isn’t legal for the military to provide border security in regards to people sneaking across. It’s a violation of federal law. It’s forcing us to take out loans and eat into savings because of it that I have an issue with.

@VannevarB Oh, I know. I’m still working six days a week.
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes Yes, dishonest report. It comes from Fox News too. Oh wait, you are only concerned when it paints you in a negative light.
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes So any bias is wrong, right? What about Fox News? Isn’t blatant support without question a violation of journalistic objectiveness as well?

@drCoker80 @charliekirk11 My point is that suddenly it’s a crisis again after Trump and others bragged about turning away the entire caravan the last time. His methods are only effective when he isn’t trying to get something.
@drCoker80 @charliekirk11 No, but mostly because it’s waste of time since they can’t actually do anything with the people since it is a violation of Posse Comitatus.
@charliekirk11 But Trump bragged about turning them away the last night. He was effective. All of a sudden are we at risk of invasion by a bunch of families from third world countries?

@realDonaldTrump None of these apply to your current predicament. Election results don't apply, you aren't in trouble for collusion (yet), success doesn't matter, and popularity is just a dumb assertion. It's high crimes and misdeamenor that matters, which if it turns out you did it, is enough.
@realDonaldTrump The majority of the country wants you out of office. You lack the dignity, intelligence, and experience to be President. We had hoped you would learn these things, but you continue to get worse every day.

@JoyEspin3 @charliekirk11 I have bills, my health insurance (which is covered to a point, but I have kids), mortgage, etc. My wife works, but she is a federal contractor and is slated to be unpaid in less than two months. I am beyond frazzled.
@JoyEspin3 @charliekirk11 Some of my frustration is at being a federal employee. I'm an excepted employee during the current shutdown, which means I continue to work, but in an unpaid status. You can understand how that can cause stress, above and beyond what an air traffic controller would incur.
@rockypup @seungminkim I am beyond frustrated. This is my fourth shutdown (or fifth?). I'm still working as I'm an excepted employee.

@JoyEspin3 @charliekirk11 And thank you for the thank you. I appreciate it. My service means more than almost anything else in my life (other than my kids and wife).
@JoyEspin3 @charliekirk11 Only trying to make a point. Right wing people are no more racist than left wing people are communist/socialist. That pissed me off just as much. I get accused of it just as much as you probably do.
Apparently snowflakes exist on both sides of the world. Though more on the right side.
@tui_malila @charliekirk11 What is a DOBBER?
@JoyEspin3 @charliekirk11 I, honestly, I do apologize for the racist thing, it was posted in passion. I get a bit irate at being targeted as a liberal communist/socialist, because it is rarely true. I was only trying to prove a point.
@JoyEspin3 @charliekirk11 Aren't you right wing? I honestly apologize if that is not correct.
@JoyEspin3 @charliekirk11 And you called me socialist/communist, so we are both falling for the same idiotic stereotype, now aren't we?
@JoyEspin3 @charliekirk11 I guess I wasn't. Us military veterans and federal employees are just dumb assholes who should be shot in the head, right?
@JoyEspin3 @charliekirk11 Nor does your adherence to your party. You assumed I was a socialist AND a communist, yet you assert that I am such. Which of us is better? Neither of us, yet you won't budge from your mindset. I am trying to and have a civilized conversation.
@JoyEspin3 @charliekirk11 I also respect the Office. I just dislike Trump. He lacks the decency, decorum, and respect for the office. I was a Republican for a very long time.

@JoyEspin3 @charliekirk11 I am neither socialist nor communist. But then again, right wingers are all racist, right?
@JoyEspin3 @charliekirk11 You are attacking my character, person, my service, my freedoms, and my very being. Why wouldn't I try to defend myself? I think you should enlist and defend the very freedoms you want to defend. Why don't you do it? I did. Why not you?

@JoyEspin3 @charliekirk11 I enlisted to defend people's rights to defend freedoms. I assume that if I defamed Obama you would be ok with it, because I'm sure you never did that, right? It's only ok to do so if you didn't ever wear a uniform?

@Idjitseverytime @TimWilsonCPA @GOP @realDonaldTrump I can’t stand Fox News and I don’t like the vitriol spewed by the extremist Trump group. However, I see some good from the conversation decent Americans can have about conditions in the country and the ability to come to an agreement on those conditions. It happens.

@realDonaldTrump You don’t have any idea what you are talking about, do you?
@realDonaldTrump So, if they voted in 2006 and 2013, I guess it was built. You countered the caravan, so everything worked. Problem solved.

@jennerific713 @realDonaldTrump There’s a Trump tweet for everything. Literally.
@realDonaldTrump Really? IT HASN’T EVEN BEEN CONFIRMED YET!
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump 1: was the Senate. 2: thanks Obama. 3: hasn’t happened. 4: again, Senate. 5; not historic. 6: again, Congress. Onward Mueller to 2019!
You know, if Trump hadn’t forced massive tariffs, the farmers wouldn’t have needed a $12 billion bailout and they could have paid for the wall.
@deplorableKael @DeviljWheat @charliekirk11 https://t.co/pqdMTpj6Yq.  It is possible, just hasn’t actually happened yet. You are jumping ahead of the Senate and economic processes.
@deplorableKael @DeviljWheat @charliekirk11 However, you are correct about one thing. If the treaty does get confirmed, and it does generate additional money, it will be in the form of tax revenue. But I doubt it will generate $5 billion in additional tax revenue. That would equate to 50 billion or more in sales alone.
@deplorableKael @DeviljWheat @charliekirk11 What funds? Where is this mysterious money coming from? You actually think the Mexican government is paying our government? Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
@deplorableKael @DeviljWheat @charliekirk11 Laws and process. Includes both sides, democratic ideals, and freedom to choose. Things much out of your limited intelligence, comprehension, and ability.
@deplorableKael @DeviljWheat @charliekirk11 No they aren’t. The treaty is not confirmed yet. Try and keep up.
@realDonaldTrump You are? There isn’t a Marine guard which is present when you are in the Oval Office.
@realDonaldTrump Wait, you said it was foolproof. Almost 100% is not foolproof.
@realDonaldTrump First you say border defense is robust after stopping the caravan then you say it is an open wound and illegals are flooding in. So which is it?
@realDonaldTrump Your campaign was focused on Russia and we all know that is why you are pulling out of Syria. You cave to pressure, and Putin has exerted it.
@realDonaldTrump Leaving Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan makes sense WHEN it makes sense. Right now it doesn’t. Look at the history of when we prematurely pulled out of Iraq. You don’t want a power vacuum. Someone explain this to him.....
@realDonaldTrump You said we defeated ISIS. Every time you tweet about them, it drops little by little.

@deplorableKael @michae1c1 @charliekirk11 Senate confirmation vote is a simple majority. 51-47 now with GOP majority or 53-45 in the 116 with GOP majority. Doesn’t really matter, does it?
@deplorableKael @michae1c1 @charliekirk11 No. I think it’s scheduling. McConnell already has the confirmation votes. He’s the one with the power.
@michae1c1 @deplorableKael @charliekirk11 Mitch McConnell as majority leader isn’t bringing it to the Senate for a vote until 2019. GOP controls that being the majority party.

So either they got two out of the four teams wrong, or they were right and two of them are just utterly dominant.
@mattjoneswallet @charliekirk11 It hasn’t happened. Will it, maybe. Jury is out. Possible recession forthcoming may negate any advantage.
@mattjoneswallet @charliekirk11 Not to mention that USMCA has yet to be approved by the Senate.
@mattjoneswallet @charliekirk11 How does that translate into government funds? Government generates revenue through taxes. We all know how that is reduced.

I have a fantastic idea on how Trump can generate revenue for his Wall without continuing to screw over federal workers:		Sell the pee-pee tape on pay-per-view.
@realDonaldTrump The year of the worker? After you just froze federal pay because of the lack of tax revenue AND forced us into furloughs and work without pay? Not to mention that the big wage gains for workers haven't been seen. Most of us aren't CEOs asshole.

@IngrahamAngle @CNN @brianstelter Were you?
@IngrahamAngle Do what?
@NRAHillbilly @PraiseGodImFree @realDonaldTrump You too!
@NRAHillbilly @PraiseGodImFree @realDonaldTrump So I suggest you go back to your nationalistic corner and I will go back to my leftist one and we can just leave each other alone. We won’t agree and we each see the other as something neither of us are. It was interesting. I don’t think you are a bad person or lack empathy.
@NRAHillbilly @PraiseGodImFree @realDonaldTrump I sincerely hope you are not one of the people who exists on Twitter solely to attack people of the other side. I’ve seen it on both sides. I try to stay away from people like that. My points are policy centric. But we aren’t going to agree, and this has devolved into stupidity.
@NRAHillbilly @PraiseGodImFree @realDonaldTrump I. Never. Said. You. Were. Xenophobic. It is the policy I oppose. These statements are NOT aimed at you. This is a discussion of governmental policy. Not a personal statement or reflection on you. I understand context gets lost on here.
@GOP @kayleighmcenany Someday you are going to realize Trump is tearing the party apart.
@NRAHillbilly @PraiseGodImFree @realDonaldTrump Both sides actually agree on illegal immigration and border security. I know it doesn’t seem like it because the propaganda that is spotted by BOTH sides. But they actually agree. The methods to deter are another story.
@NRAHillbilly @PraiseGodImFree @realDonaldTrump Honestly, the moderate approach to immigration isn’t popular. It sounds to left and right adherents as a compromise and a cop out. The right extremists want harsh measures, the left wants the exact opposite. We need a moderate compromise. IMO. I’m libertarian on my beliefs.
@NRAHillbilly @PraiseGodImFree @realDonaldTrump I see the solution for our moral dilemma associated with immigration being the midpoint between ‘no one gets in’ and ‘everyone gets in’ and the extreme of ‘everyone crosses illegally.’ But that takes work, time, and isn’t convenient for either party propaganda line.
@PraiseGodImFree @NRAHillbilly @realDonaldTrump You are more at risk from American criminals than most immigrants. It just doesn’t seem like it because the news focuses on the negative side of immigration. It is skewed based on news coverage.
@PraiseGodImFree @NRAHillbilly @realDonaldTrump The problem is Republicans think Democrats are evil and Democrats think Republicans are evil.
@NRAHillbilly @PraiseGodImFree @realDonaldTrump Where did I say you said it? If I implied it, it was not intentional. I’m speaking of a perception that pervades more than half of the country that the policies are xenophobic in nature.
@NRAHillbilly @PraiseGodImFree @realDonaldTrump Other than your nationalist mantra, I think you  are a good person. But nationalism is not patriotism. Nationalism is ethnocentric. I believe in America, but not a nationalism approach to isolationism and despising other people.
@NRAHillbilly @PraiseGodImFree @realDonaldTrump The lol was not for that. That is utterly despicable. But as long as we are lobbing partisan hate at each other, I notice you didn’t say anything about the guy who threatened to rape my wife. I guess that makes you just as bad as me. Maybe you’re a closet Democrat? 🤪
@NRAHillbilly @PraiseGodImFree @realDonaldTrump Both sides are equally shitty. Yours and mine. I’m actually more moderate than you want to believe. But you also don’t know me.
@NRAHillbilly @PraiseGodImFree @realDonaldTrump As long as we are bringing up threats, I guess I should mention the Republican who messaged me a picture of my wife and said he was going to come to Albuquerque and rape her.
@NRAHillbilly @PraiseGodImFree @realDonaldTrump The left says the same thing about the right. Lol. Just because ONE person says it doesn’t the remainder of the 65 million is the same. Otherwise you Republicans would all be like the OK senator who was busted for child porn. You aren’t all like him. You are mostly good people.
@NRAHillbilly @PraiseGodImFree @realDonaldTrump I call out anyone who is like that.
@NRAHillbilly @PraiseGodImFree @realDonaldTrump I apologize if I came across the way you think I did. It wasn’t my intention.
@NRAHillbilly @PraiseGodImFree @realDonaldTrump I wasn’t trying to attack, but I see xenophobia being a foundation for some of the policy of “every immigrant is bad” and “no one gets in at all regardless of cause or need.”
@PraiseGodImFree @NRAHillbilly @realDonaldTrump Our anti illegal policy is working. Deportations are up 2x, border apprehensions as well. Those are GOOD numbers and evidence of a good policy. But we can be better, can’t we? Better people? A better nation?
@NRAHillbilly @PraiseGodImFree @realDonaldTrump I’ve mentioned them several times. We both counter with opposite information. I think we agree, just from different perspectives.
@PraiseGodImFree @NRAHillbilly @realDonaldTrump One last thought then I have to go to work. It’s easy to process info that conforms with your belief system and disregard that info that does not.
@PraiseGodImFree @NRAHillbilly @realDonaldTrump We do. I agree. My point is xenophobia is disgusting and I can’t believe you won’t agree with such a basic ethical premise.
@NRAHillbilly @PraiseGodImFree @realDonaldTrump It goes both ways ma’am. We have to care about BOTH sides. I do, regardless of your perception of us stupid Democrats.
@PraiseGodImFree @NRAHillbilly @realDonaldTrump Absolutely. I am curious about the timeline. My local news (I live in New Mexico) said they retroactively amended the timeline. For accuracy they said.
@PraiseGodImFree @NRAHillbilly @realDonaldTrump I see good and bad from our policy, but there has to be a balance. Not all@in, not all out. Prosecute appropriately and vet immigrants rigorously.
@PraiseGodImFree @NRAHillbilly @realDonaldTrump Facts matter. Emotions do too. So does empathy. You need all three. I perceive you two as lacking the last two. I’m sure you are good people, but you are blinded by information that is intentionally skewed to make you form an opinion.
@NRAHillbilly @PraiseGodImFree @realDonaldTrump It’s much better in this country and you know it. We are the land of opportunity. Mexico is rife with drug problems and a massive drug war. For all of our problems, we are still the best place in the world
@NRAHillbilly @PraiseGodImFree @realDonaldTrump Where’s your heart and empathy for this girl? I guess in the same place you say mine is. https://t.co/69mIMwhvmr
@NRAHillbilly @PraiseGodImFree @realDonaldTrump Can you read? I don’t support illegal immigration and anyone who commits a crime should be duly prosecuted. But I don’t support racist xenophobia.
@NRAHillbilly @PraiseGodImFree @realDonaldTrump Sorry, it’s what comes of trying to be an emotional empathic person. You should try to sometime. You might find it conforms more with Christian ideals.
@PraiseGodImFree @NRAHillbilly @realDonaldTrump But we also don’t know that. An investigation should be done. An independent one. My take only.
@PraiseGodImFree @NRAHillbilly @realDonaldTrump I heard the same thing. Do we know why? I don’t. I could guess that he thought they were going to be taken away from him. But that is just a guess.
@NRAHillbilly @PraiseGodImFree @realDonaldTrump Why not? If there is work and we have the support system to help them get started, why not?
@NRAHillbilly @PraiseGodImFree @realDonaldTrump Where is your empathy for the two kids who died? They are innocent of a crime and just going with their parents. Do you believe those who caused, intentional or inadvertent, should be prosecuted?
@NRAHillbilly @PraiseGodImFree @realDonaldTrump I care deeply about them. But you are falling prey to small sample fallacy. They are the exception rather than the norm. Most of them are good people. The tragedy has to be prosecuted, but a uniform policy of xenophobia is not appropriate.
@PraiseGodImFree @NRAHillbilly @realDonaldTrump Because it’s a long journey, people who are older don’t want to uproot, and they are the ones with young kids and a family who are young enough to start over.
@NRAHillbilly @PraiseGodImFree @realDonaldTrump They did. On both counts. They were told to go to hell by the leader of your party.
@PraiseGodImFree @NRAHillbilly @realDonaldTrump We have a lot of security on the border. I work directly with them as a federal employee (who isn’t getting paid right now due to your glorious leader).
@PraiseGodImFree @NRAHillbilly @realDonaldTrump And your lack of empathy for the 80-90% of the people, including the two kids who died in ICE custody, makes you a hypocrite.
@PraiseGodImFree @NRAHillbilly @realDonaldTrump I support legal immigration. I don’t support illegal immigration. But I also have a heart, and right now our policy is detrimental to our moral character. Isolationism and xenophobia are ethically deplorable.
@PraiseGodImFree @NRAHillbilly @realDonaldTrump The Caravan tried to get in legally. We told them to go to hell. We are not a good nation right now.
@PraiseGodImFree @NRAHillbilly @realDonaldTrump Our immigrant policy is outdated and xenophobic. There are good decent people who want in desperately, but they can’t get in  so they sneak in. What does that say about them? What does it say about us?
@NRAHillbilly @PraiseGodImFree @realDonaldTrump I want you to think about this. Imagine people who are so desperate that they break a law in an isolationist xenophobic country by illegally crossing. That is true desperation. And we threw them away like trash. What does that say about our Christian ideals as our nation?
@NRAHillbilly @PraiseGodImFree @realDonaldTrump Lol. Walk away when you have your belief system challenged. It’s ok. I realize people don’t like that. I’m saying xenophobia and racism are not Christian ideals. Preach it to your fellow Republicans, not me.
@NRAHillbilly @PraiseGodImFree @realDonaldTrump From what I have read from credible sources, though granted they are estimates, the number of 'good' people is about 80-90%. And, yes, there are bad people in every group, but if we were to ban the entire group, the GOP would be banned alone for the Trump campaign felonies.
@PraiseGodImFree @NRAHillbilly @realDonaldTrump What about the two kids who died in ICE custody? I assume you don't care about them either? You have failed to mention that. It's easy to hate a group when you have been told by Fox News and Trump that they are bad and you should hate them. I'm sure you haven't met any. How else?
@historBilia @realDonaldTrump I'm still waiting for that one to happen. It's too bad his base doesn't realize that he said it as an impulse because he has no idea what he is talking about. An impulsive idiot, that's what they wanted and that's what they got.
@PraiseGodImFree @NRAHillbilly @realDonaldTrump This why do you religious right people hate immigrants so much? Why are you trying to paint a few bad people as being representative of everyone who wants to make a new life for them and their family? Why extend hatred to everyone not like you? Why encourage xenophobia?
@PraiseGodImFree @NRAHillbilly @realDonaldTrump I am a wonderful veteran. And I was a Methodist for most of my life. I still believe in the ideals of Christianity and I practice the religious teachings. However, I see way to many people who profess to be Christian who hate everyone else. It is disingenuous and you know it.

@SAlabamaNobody @soleilchaux @DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump I agree. Both the intervention and the premature withdrawal are to blame.
@MrWackypep @realDonaldTrump It’s a House vote and a Senate vote. Not a republican vote or a democrat vote. Perhaps nothing more than semantics, but an important distinction IMO.
@chuck_kopsho @SAlabamaNobody @soleilchaux @DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump Actually, I think you mean Bush. The initial withdrawal from Iraq created the power vacuum. But I’m not looking to create blame and neither should you. Just prevent a reoccurrence of a problem.
@TrueAchievement 60,000 in one day? Holy crap.
@DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump You’re a smart guy. You understand political power vacuums. Our presence, as much as our military might, helped stifle the rise of ISIS. Withdrawing from Iraq helped create the situation where they strengthened, and this will likely do the same.
@realDonaldTrump That’s not what you told Pelosi. You own this. Man up and take responsibility. Oh, and as a federal employees, I’m forwarding my bills to you.

@realDonaldTrump There is no such thing as a House Republic Vote. There is the House vote and Senate vote. Parse it out by party if you want, but be accurate in your terminology.

@realDonaldTrump You didn't win. You still have NOTHING. You need 60 votes in the Senate, and you won't get it. They need to compromise, you need to compromise, and you all need allow time to sit down and work it out. It can be done, but with a shutdown.
@realDonaldTrump We won't save money. It will cost 100s of billions of dollars, and existing measure will NOT go away. Combine the two and maybe you have a good plan.
@realDonaldTrump You know tech better than anyone else? You don't even know how to use spellcheck.

@calvin81156899 @rmsowell @realDonaldTrump All. Not some. That would be the equivalent of me losing my entire paycheck. I don’t really expect you to do that of course, just trying to give an equivalent situation of me not getting paid. Trying to provide context.
@calvin81156899 @rmsowell @realDonaldTrump It’s easy to think about one issue without considering the impact on two million federal employees. Perhaps a lack of empathy. Perhaps selfish. Perhaps just not understanding. I’m not sure.

@OneBADMAC @realDonaldTrump @USArmy I agree. But we still have to abide by the law. It’s a violation of Posse Comitatus to use the military for law enforcement. The House can allocate money to drug enforcement, bolster the DEA and CBP. But they have to actually do it. The House is more to blame than any POTUS.
@OneBADMAC @realDonaldTrump @USArmy It’s a violation of federal law for the military to arrest them. Unless it is an invasion, which would be a stretch. It’s a CBP responsibility. I’m a believer in division of powers.
@OneBADMAC @uniquetresbyrn @realDonaldTrump True. Simple construction. Complicated logistics. Remote locations.
@uniquetresbyrn @OneBADMAC @realDonaldTrump There wasn’t much more they could do on the border. They weren’t allowed to arrest anyone because it violates federal law for the military to be used for law enforcement within the US borders.
@OneBADMAC @realDonaldTrump @USArmy Is that the wrong article? Article 4 discusses the state and federal interaction.
@OneBADMAC @realDonaldTrump @USArmy It’s a logistical nightmare. And, from a budget perspective, it’s a bit nebulous moving money around. Normally that falls to the House.
@OneBADMAC @realDonaldTrump @USArmy I’m aware. I was in the military. I’m not arguing about the fence, just whether or not it is feasible for the military to build it and whether it is legal. Frankly, the jury is out on both.
@OneBADMAC @realDonaldTrump @USArmy Budget appropriations come from the House. And legislation constrains the WH, such as Posse Comitatus. There is no such thing as absolute authority in this country, however much some want it. Checks and balances have to prevail. It’s a brilliant system.
@uniquetresbyrn @OneBADMAC @realDonaldTrump I was in the military. Depends on what you want them to do.
@OneBADMAC @realDonaldTrump @USArmy The other issue is logistics. Army Corp is Engineers is about 37,000 people. Border is almost 2000 miles. Massive undertaking.
@NexusGrunt @realDonaldTrump Probably neither. Just dumb luck. Emphasis on dumb.
@OneBADMAC @realDonaldTrump @USArmy Difference here is this isn’t a public works project, at least not by definition. It’s border security. Just seems to be a desperate ploy to find money and end run the budget process. The House owns that, not the WH.
@LarryFulmerJr @realDonaldTrump Good point. On all of it. 😁
@NexusGrunt @realDonaldTrump At least he spelled it right. 😆
@realDonaldTrump You wanted to close it? You mean like you divested your other conflicting interests?
@realDonaldTrump Again, similar to the Clinton Foundation. You are both equally sleazy.
@realDonaldTrump It’s your foundation. If you wanted to close it, you could have.
@realDonaldTrump Sounds like the Clinton Foundation, which is very similar. I know you hate to hear that.
@realDonaldTrump I seem to remember another President using a similar mission accomplished message.
@realDonaldTrump Wait, you’re going to have the military build the wall?
@realDonaldTrump So why a budget item then? Pay for it with surplus. Oh wait..........
@America1st18 @robbyc46 @StewartMaxwel20 @TomiLahren @foxandfriends Oh. Lol. 😁
@America1st18 @robbyc46 @StewartMaxwel20 @TomiLahren @foxandfriends That makes you a bad person then. You can’t support immorality and unethical behavior and claim to be good.
@realDonaldTrump At least you spelled Border correctly this time.
@TomiLahren @foxandfriends And, just for the record, after reading about Kevin Parker (never heard of him before), he is a complete piece of crap. He loses his temper and says inappropriate things. God knows we don’t want that, do we.
@TomiLahren @foxandfriends Either that or you all really don’t care about what Tucker said about immigrants and you really are all as racist as Democrats believe.
@TomiLahren @foxandfriends I guess people only care about what people say when it is the other side. If the retorts to my comment are any indication.
@America1st18 @robbyc46 @StewartMaxwel20 @TomiLahren @foxandfriends Nothing says Christian like a man who cheats on his wife with a porn star and then pays her off to cover it up and lies about it.
@StewartMaxwel20 @robbyc46 @TomiLahren @foxandfriends Well, now that’s just funny. 😆
Ah yes, the cruelest joke of all. Christmas Eve is a holiday for federal employees, but we're not going to get paid for it 🤨
@TomiLahren @foxandfriends Let's discuss people who say inappropriate things that they don't mean. Oh wait, one of them is your coworker.

@realDonaldTrump Save billions? How? You're going to get rid of ICE, CBP, and all the current border security?

@realDonaldTrump So it's a hoax because of the dossier? What?
@realDonaldTrump A fraud and a hoax because some random dude says so?
@themyles39 @realDonaldTrump Like Clinton and Nixon, the Special Counsel started with one thing and found a whole lot more. It was predicted at the beginning. It is what it is.
@themyles39 @realDonaldTrump No. Trump’s problems are, so far, outside of that. He keeps saying collusion, but there are a whole host of problems he is facing that aren’t collusion.
@themyles39 @realDonaldTrump And apparently campaign finance violations. And FARA violations. And tax fraud. To name a few.
@kmbrlyfrs @realDonaldTrump You might want to set your standards higher.
@realDonaldTrump Jesus dude. Let it go. The rest of us have. You now have to worry about indictments.
@realDonaldTrump I don’t know. Your party has had the majority for last two years of your presidency. Why don’t you ask them?

@realDonaldTrump Meaningless numbers? They are trying to curb inflation because of your tariffs.
@realDonaldTrump Let's assume, for the sake of argument, there wasn't Collusion. But we do know there were felonies. Apparently a lot of them.
