@MrWarrenOut @Elise_Jordan Yeah, it’s all problematic.  We’re in uncharted territory because of the tax cut during a time of economic prosperity.

Our fight is the same. Never before has being liberal been so crystal clear. It is to work toward attainment of liberty equally for all people. It is not a talking point. 		It isn’t divisive. 		The goal is elusive. 		The path is unclear. 		But, once encountered, it is known
You are being asked to forfeit your power when frightened and influenced to retreat to “your kind, your people, your race.”  		To forfeit your freedom 		To forfeit your voice		Your strength 		Your mind 		Truth itself. 		You are wanted in the stable		All of you
As our adventurous ancestors fought, we fight for equality, autonomy, and respect. 		There is power in these aspirations as they coalesce us, similar and different, together. 		This is why the greedy work so hard and in concert to divide us.
No matter what you think, 		we all have been blessed to be Americans. 		The ever evolving America is the perpetual New World promising a better future. 		It is a gift as well as a responsiblity.		We have the chance to nurture a dream that predates recorded history

@Din_of_Inequity @DeVos1990 @sirDukeDevin @beganwstaubach Give me a break. It’s not a horrible idea. Having the runner up as VP would force compromise.

@Crommunist @jonrog1 I was trying to allude a very meta sense of the event.

@meme_america @Maxwellhuracane Do you think they’re being antiestablishment by not liking Bill Gates’ people?  Being a stalwart defender of free speech, you must be rejoicing. Cheers 🍻 to you.

3) The Special Counsel investigation to continue unimpeded until its natural conclusion. 		4) Secure and fair elections without partisan gerrymandering for all, and forever.
This is, and always will be, a nation by the people and for the people.  We demand: 		1) The removal of the criminal, president Trump by resignation, or congressional impeachment. 		2) A complete overhaul of campaign finance laws: eliminating all campaign contributions and PAC’s.
It’s safe to say that Donald Trump violated campaign finance laws in his 2016 presidential election.  Some may argue that the president cannot be indicted, that he may not be prosecuted, but we all now know president Trump is a felon.  In this country, NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW.

@ofTimeSpace @lornalane85 @Strandjunker @cnnbrk Isn’t it considered fact that the GOP was hacked too, but the information was never released to Wikileaks. They had RNC voter roles (and DNCs), emails and all kinds of dirt. I guess very damaging critiques of the president was found in the GOP emails or worse. Blackmail! Or power

@rex_angry @realThunderKiss @FoxNews @POTUS I’m a little fuzzy on your broad use of agencies.
@rex_angry @realThunderKiss @FoxNews @POTUS Are you suggesting an independent voting day oversight committee?  Perhaps selected like jury duty?
@rex_angry @realThunderKiss @FoxNews @POTUS I totally agree. Paper ballots with loads of redundant human oversight.  Maybe incorporate straight up mechanical tallying machines.  I don’t think it’s necessary to know the outcome on the day of the election.  What’s necessary is that the vote is correct.
@nursegalmom Maybe he had a check up? Or, someone else in his family needed a CBC? I don’t know about Manafort.
@rex_angry @realThunderKiss @FoxNews @POTUS I’m interested to hear your thoughts on ways, or way we, as a nation, can reclaim our rights to create a government for and by the people?
@FoxNews @POTUS So ... perhaps he’s lost his mind.  We can all agree on that, right?

@rex_angry @realThunderKiss @FoxNews @POTUS Cool.  So, we agree on the basics of how our government should work. Great powers are trying to divide us.  We need to stay united. We must.
@SaraCarterDC @JJCarafano @realDonaldTrump Oh, Fox “News.”  Good thing we defeated “communist Japan” in WWII.

@jeffwilsontech No. I’m sorry. I don’t mean to upset you. I was saying, it would be nice to know if his actions have suffered personal repercussions. Rather than a hit piece.
@jeffwilsontech We can either destroy or coax him into acting right.  I vote for coaxing first
@jeffwilsontech I think how Elon is feeling matters very much precisely because of how powerful he is. If, the outrage over his anti-socialism remarks funneled into him has made him pause, I think it’s newsworthy. What’s the point of publishing a hit piece when you may have insight into the man?
@Dobgrrman Then it’s obstruction
@jeffwilsontech What you may think of the man aside; the citation you posted attempts to humanize Elon by exposing the toll his bombast has on him personally

@FeliciaLBriggs1 @thehill Continue with jailing the rest. These people do not have different political views. They want to destroy us. It’s a big difference.
@AreYouEducated @thehill It’s clear; MAGAts are not defined by wealth. They are not defined by conservative values. Trump tapped into a racist underpinning of eugenic thought and nationalism. They are white racists. The exceptions are deluded sycophants. A neurosurgeon runs HUD because he’s black. 4Real
