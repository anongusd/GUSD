House Agriculture Committee Chairman Michael Conaway, R-Texas, said the farm bill just passed by the committee by Republicans only will not be on the House floor next week but he hopes as early in May as possible.
The House Agriculture Committee has passed the farm bill on a party line vote, with all Republicans voting for it and all Democrats no. Vote was 26 yes to 20 no.
House Ag passes King Interstate Commerce amendment after rejecting Denham amendment to turn issue of state rules on matters such as egg production and veal eggs to USDA. Vote on Denham substitute was 12 to 33, with Denham appearing to be the only Republican who supported it.
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Goodlatte, R-Va., supports King Interstate Commerce amendment and opposes Dunham setting up GOP regional battle over egg and veal production. Rep. Costa, D-Calif. supports Denham.
Reps. King, R-Iowa, and Denham, R-Calif.,  disagree over interstate commerce, King offers amendment to stop egg production standards and veal cages but Denham says King amendment would interfere with state's rights. Denham strikes King and offers amendment for USDA to analyze.
Rep. Yoho has withdrawn his amendment on horticulture, crop insurance title is closed out and Rep. Steve King will offer his Interstate Commerce amendment on the miscellaneous title of the bill.
House Ag has closed out the nutrition title and the credit title and rural development title and research title, forestry title while Rep. Ted Yoho, R-Fla., will offer an amendment on horticulture.
House Ag Committee is continuing to discuss the nutrition title of the farm bill, with House Nutrition Subcommittee ranking member Jim McGovern, D-Mass., urging committee to send the bill back to the subcommittees for further work. SNAP is a food program," McGovern said.
House Ag recesses from farm bill markup for votes on House floor. No time set to return.
House Ag has finished the discussion of Titles II and III and House Ag Nutrition Subcommittee Chairman Glenn Thompson, R-Pa., is beginning to discuss Title IV, the nutrition title, to correct what House Ag Chairman Conaway calls incorrect from statements by  Democrats.
House Ag Committee has finished discussion of Title I (commodities) and moved on to Title II (conservation). The committee did not vote on Title I.
