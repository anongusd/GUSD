"Many shepherds have had to leave the reservation,‚Äù said Tara Roche, president of the Navajo Sheep Project.  "Considering the role sheep play in the Navajo way of life, this is a travesty." https://t.co/f06IwZNu3k
According to the National Drought Mitigation Center, nearly all of New Mexico is in severe or extreme drought. The drought is hitting the Navajo Nation reservation especially hard, threatening traditional shepherds and a pastoral way of life going back generations.
In Navajo culture, sheep "are part of our prayers and ceremonies. They have sacred names and sacred chants. They are not just animals, they are our spiritual guardians." https://t.co/f06IwZNu3k

‚ÄúThe sheep are like our ancestors. We were taught, from the year zero to where we are now, that sheep is life,‚Äù said Ron Garnanez, a shepherd and president of the board of the Navajo Lifeway, a group dedicated to preserving tribal sheep culture.
Sheep even figure in the annual Miss Navajo Nation pageant: Contestants must slaughter, skin and clean a ewe in about an hour.
History says Spaniards brought sheep here 500 years ago. But many Navajo 	believe they were here long before that, citing ancient songs and chants extolling the animals. https://t.co/f06IwZNu3k

Here's how we reported on Tijuana‚Äôs massive rise in homicides https://t.co/41u3v4CRqb
The violence shows no signs of stopping. There were 196 homicides recorded in the first 29 days of January, the most violent start to a year in Tijuana‚Äôs history.
To understand the violence and its impact on the city, the L.A. Times conducted more than 3 dozen interviews over the last 9 months with law enforcement officials, criminal justice experts, gang members, victims and their families. Read our findings here https://t.co/OI3jnThzGG
Officials said one drug is to blame for the growing carnage in Tijuana: methamphetamine, or as it is known in Spanish, cristal. https://t.co/CZem9Hwfko
Local and state officials estimate that 90% of the city‚Äôs homicides are linked to local drug sales, a pattern authorities are seeing in Juarez, Cancun and other cities at the forefront of a nationwide rise in killings, which have nearly doubled over the last three years. https://t.co/pdJIo95Dk1
In the past, killings in Tijuana were driven by drug cartels battling for trafficking routes to the U.S. Today's crisis is fundamentally different - the root cause is the growing local drug trade, with low-level dealers fighting over territory.
With 140 killings per 100,000 people, Tijuana is now one of the deadliest cities in the world. https://t.co/gf2QEUHE6G

In California, just 5% of women live in a county without an abortion clinic, according to Guttmacher Institute. In Texas, 43% do https://t.co/OWggwGaz0x
To address that imbalance, abortion rights activists created a program in 2016 to match clinics needing doctors with those who could travel to work. Estimates by abortion providers put the number of doctors commuting across state lines at around 100 https://t.co/ixRUXuymkE
The doctors who perform the abortions are spread unevenly across the country. Some states have very few physicians willing to provide abortions. In the Bay Area, there are so many physicians who want to do abortions that many can‚Äôt find work in the region https://t.co/OWggwGaz0x https://t.co/R9HIP6Bsj6
