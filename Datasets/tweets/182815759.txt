A3.2 In fact, according to @feedingamerica, for every meal it provides through its network of food banks, SNAP provides *12*. In other words, SNAP is an effective, responsive anti-hunger tool that would only be weakened by the proposed rule. #HandsOffSNAP #Hungerpc19
A3.1 As seen with the #GovernmentShutdown, food banks are incredible at providing Americans with food assistance when they most need it. However, food banks can‚Äôt fill the gaping holes that the proposed rule would be poised to create in SNAP. #HandsOffSNAP #hungerpc19 https://t.co/mAW7xqr16C

RT @ARHungerRelief: SNAP touched more than 500,000 Arkansans in 2018. #SNAPMatters #HandsOffSNAP
A2.3 Alongside reducing food insecurity, SNAP offers a number of additional benefits, including improving health and generating economic activity. The proposed rule also threatens to disrupt the receipt of such benefits. #HandsOffSNAP #hungerpc19 https://t.co/VxOz6jgekw
A2.2 Such a harsh impact would be equivalent to taking 8.5 billion+ meals from the plates of individuals. In a nutshell, the Trump Administration‚Äôs proposed SNAP rule would make hunger in the U.S. far, far worse. #HandsOffSNAP #hungerpc19 https://t.co/3nWNJlvWkK
A2.1 Per the @USDA‚Äôs own analysis, the proposed rule would eliminate SNAP eligibility for 755,000 low-income adults and, over 10 years, take away $15 billion in SNAP food benefits. #HandsOffSNAP #hungerpc19 https://t.co/7LQtgT1mDt
A1.5: By boosting the purchasing power of low-income people, SNAP is also an effective anti-poverty program: per the Census Bureau, SNAP lifted 3.4 million people out of poverty in 2017. https://t.co/KsJ55cMDms #HandsOffSNAP #hungerpc19
A1.4 What has proved to be a powerful tool for reducing food insecurity in America? SNAP! SNAP provides monthly benefits to low-income people, helping to boost their food purchasing power. #HandsOffSNAP #hungerpc19 https://t.co/Ug9Rqh0QfY
A1.3 Struggling to put food on the table is particularly devastating for many vulnerable populations, including children, seniors, people with disabilities, veterans, and African Americans and Hispanics. #HandsOffSNAP #hungerpc19
A1.2 While the data reveal a decline in household food insecurity in 2017 from the previous year (the rate dropped from 12.3 to 11.8 percent), food insecurity is still too high, impacting 1 in 8 people and 1 in 6 children. #HandsOffSNAP #hungerpc19

A4.6: Access to SNAP for babies in low-income households is especially crucial as the early childhood period sets the foundation for physical, social, and emotional health, as well as establishes dietary patterns and preferences that can last a lifetime. #MaternalJustice
A4.5: Per research, young children in food-insecure households who receive SNAP benefits are less likely to be overweight, at developmental risk, and in fair or poor health than young children in food-insecure households not receiving SNAP. #MaternalJustice
A4.4: Among babies and young children, SNAP continues to be essential to short- and long-term health, development, and nutrition. #MaternalJustice https://t.co/SQ7weHHiLK
A4.3: As far as long-term impacts for women, SNAP access early in life is linked to reports of being in good health and having increased educational attainment, earnings, and income later in adulthood.

A1.7: Despite SNAP being the nation‚Äôs first line of defense against hunger for more than 40 million Americans, SNAP alone is not enough to eradicate hunger: average monthly benefits amount to just $1.40 per meal, limiting the program‚Äôs impact. #MaternalJustice
A1.6: #SNAPMatters everywhere. Regardless of where you live, SNAP is used to put food on tables in your community. Find out how many people participate in SNAP in your state: https://t.co/hbBsA4OAOF #MaternalJustice

A1.4: In addition to helping reduce food insecurity and poverty, SNAP generates economic stability and improves health and general well-being with long-lasting effects. #MaternalJustice https://t.co/7zBvWbgvad
A1.3: By boosting the purchasing power of low-income people, SNAP is also an effective anti-poverty program: per the Census Bureau, SNAP lifted 3.4 million people out of poverty in 2017. #MaternalJustice
A1.2: According to @feedingamerica, for every meal that it provides through its network of food banks, SNAP provides 12. In other words, SNAP is an effective, responsive anti-hunger tool. #MaternalJustice
A1.1: SNAP is a federal nutrition assistance program that provides monthly benefits to eligible low-income people to purchase food. SNAP provides millions of struggling households with benefits, including households with children, seniors, and veterans. #MaternalJustice https://t.co/JZr1ML9FvI

A7.e: To learn more about the proposed #publiccharge rule and its potential impact, check out resources from the Protecting Immigrant Families campaign, of which FRAC is the nutrition sector lead: https://t.co/zIJZsLHj4C #SaludTues
A7.d: We also have resources available for crafting comments that detail how the proposed rule would exacerbate hunger, etc., alongside resources for galvanizing your network to denounce the rule: https://t.co/17DYWWXWGU #SaludTues
A7.c: We have created an online comment platform that you can use to submit a *unique* comment to urge the Trump Administration to withdraw its proposed rule. Use your voice before the December 10th deadline: https://t.co/TEf67rZ1u9 #SaludTues
A7.b: How can individuals #ProtectFamilies and denounce the proposed rule today? By submitting a comment! Federal law requires that the rule be subject to a comment period that will shape the future of the rule. #SaludTues
A7.a: Let‚Äôs be clear: no one who is eligible for public benefits should be deterred, penalized, stigmatized, or suffer adverse immigration consequences for their legally authorized use of them. It‚Äôs time to oppose the draconian rule! #SaludTues https://t.co/7f7QiKSlpA
A6.b: Children would be especially affected, as one in four children have at least one immigrant parent, and 80% of these children are U.S. citizens. Beyond affecting individuals, the proposed rule would affect entire communities. #SaludTues
A6.a: Entire families often have mixed status and include U.S. citizens. If one individual in an immigrant household is deterred from accessing benefits that provide food, health care, etc., the entire household would suffer. #SaludTues https://t.co/i7DDPsa6W5
A5.c: More specifically, 18.3 million Latinos, 3.2 million Asians and Pacific Islanders, 1.8 million Blacks and Africans, and 2.5 million whites would feel the impact of the proposed rule. This is a rule that would have *huge* consequences for communities of color. #SaludTues
A5.b: In fact, the Department of Homeland Security has itself documented potential negative outcomes of the rule. ‚¨áÔ∏è¬†#SaludTues https://t.co/IdwUZnu8cz
A5.a: Immigrants of varied backgrounds would be impacted by the rule, especially in ways that would adversely affect health, nutrition, and well-being. https://t.co/ov27cajdgJ

A4.b: This is likely because of the fact that immigrants want what we all want: a rewarding and meaningful life that offers a chance to make a living, raise a family, and contribute to society. #SaludTues

A1.d: Why are so many concerned about the proposed rule? In a nutshell, the rule would greatly undercut decades of anti-hunger and anti-poverty efforts by deterring immigrant families from accessing benefits that safeguard their general well-being. #SaludTues
A1.c: The Trump Administration's proposed #publiccharge rule threatens to unravel longstanding, sound policy by expanding the benefits that would be used to make a #publiccharge determination, including Medicaid and SNAP: https://t.co/cHeFomYCPO #SaludTues
A1.b: Under current policy, the only government benefits used to make a #publiccharge determination are (1) cash-assistance programs (e.g. SSI, TANF) and (2) government-funded long-term institutional care. #SaludTues
A1.a: For decades, #publiccharge rules have been used to identify people who may depend significantly on government benefits to make ends meet. If someone is likely to become a ‚Äúpublic charge,‚Äù they may be denied admission to the U.S. or a green card. #SaludTues https://t.co/TESdZLOKqg

How can you take action? Make your voice heard! FRAC has developed a comment platform to express your opposition to the #publiccharge rule: https://t.co/TEf67rZ1u9. Model comments are available for various stakeholders.
The message is clear: the proposed #publiccharge rule could not only have consequences for immigrant families, but for Americans everywhere. Poverty, hunger, &amp; food insecurity could worsen, undoing the progress of previous anti-hunger &amp; anti-poverty efforts.
4a. The @USDA estimates that every $5 in new #SNAP benefits generates $9 in economic activity. Individuals forgoing #SNAP = states stripped of millions of dollars in fed. funding that could pay for food &amp; create jobs in food retail, transportation, &amp; ag sectors.
4‚É£: Harm to state &amp; local economies, large &amp; small businesses, &amp; individuals
3b. Many families may forgo assistance from programs like #SNAP b/c of the climate of fear &amp; confusion produced by the proposed rule or b/c of faulty advice given out of an abundance of caution.
3a. Immigrants will struggle w/ how to make sense of the complex rule &amp; how it could jeopardize the immigration status of oneself or a family member. Also, service providers working w/ immigrants may also fail to know how to interpret the rule &amp; adequately advise families.
3‚É£: Generate confusion among immigrants, gov‚Äôt agencies, schools, service providers, charitable networks, &amp; advocates as to whether families could receive benefits w/o putting their or a loved one‚Äôs immigration status at risk
2a. Following mass disenrollment from #SNAP, the charitable network, alongside states &amp; localities, would bear costs associated w/ responding to increased need, even as it struggles to meet existing needs.
2‚É£: Shift costs to states, localities, &amp; charitable &amp; nonprofit sectors that would not be able to meet resulting community needs
1c. #SNAP is a crucial source of support for nutrition, health, learning, &amp; economic security. Per recent data, SNAP lifted 3.4 million people out of poverty in 2017. Decreased participation in SNAP rolls back progress in eradicating hunger &amp; poverty. https://t.co/PwJFgJKxyA
1b. Already, reports from anti-hunger advocates &amp; media stories have highlighted that just the threat of the rule has resulted in eligible individuals, including children, forgoing #SNAP benefits and/or other assistance: https://t.co/ocgkxPDbyE

Under the proposed rule, immigrant families would be forced to make impossible choices b/t accessing vital programs that safeguard their health, nutrition, housing, &amp; economic security &amp; keeping their family together in the U.S.
The proposed rule radically expands the list of programs considered in a #publiccharge determination, including critical nutrition programs like #SNAP--our nation‚Äôs first line of defense against hunger.
This week, the Trump Admin. published a proposed #publiccharge rule to the Federal Register that would undercut efforts to address food insecurity &amp; poverty by making it harder for immigrant families to access a range of benefits essential to our nation‚Äôs health &amp; well-being.
