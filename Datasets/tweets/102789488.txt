The other threat to drones here? The dogs on the beach. Watched a pug named Rumi track a drone on its way back into shore, then attack it on landing. Owner apparently aware this might happen because he was all over it before real damage done.
There’s an Air Force radar system on the bluff top above Mavericks that, according to drone photogs trying to film this today, messes with their frequencies just about when the drone reaches the lineup. Watched a guy barely save his very expensive drone moments before impact.
And there may be women out there too, here for the contest that organizers postponed. But I just saw guys paddling out.... https://t.co/dxcSFC2rsn

It’s not umbrage, it’s fairness. If I wrote that the Obama admin was shitty, and you pointed to health care and the Iran deal and the economy’s recovery, I might think  I was wrong to be so broad in my criticism. You  are a great guy, just wrong in judging this year by last. https://t.co/TEy3G938MC

Who is they? Ruth Marcus and did not treat politics as blood sport. We talked about politics, Bezos, regional journalism, my time writing about Obama and the midterms.

@jwgop @TVietor08 Thanks man, just spent the last two days there. May prove your point - me and my colleagues are “garbage politics”- but it felt more than that for me. #Politicon2018
I honestly remember that - and I was 8 years old. My parents saw the Stones at the Boston Garden in 1966 and are not easily impressed by stardom. They were like kids when they walked by those two, that’s why it was so memorable. https://t.co/tN5sks2SnP
So hard to watch...Yet wonderful. https://t.co/OjA45N5EtQ
Yep. I will say  that my parents took my sister and me to the south of France that year. I recall nothing - except walking down a hotel hallway, past a man in a top hat and a woman in dark clothes, saying hi, and M&amp;D staring at each other as we passed. “Mick and Bianca....” https://t.co/F6D63wauzs
So true. Best rock and roll album of all time -  completely fueled by wine from @OKnox grandfather’s village store in south of France. Do a top five list of where you would want to be fly on the wall in history. The making of “Exile” in that house makes mine. https://t.co/AfvRykNDhu

Yep. Again, I think it’s the slow then fast thing that really brings out the air guitarist in all of us. https://t.co/2u3rk78rxd
The only thing that comes close isany song on “Exile on Main Street.” Sweet Virginia, where I air guitar acoustic, or Torn and Ftayed where I’m more my traditional rock and roll guitar. But that’s choice - Feeling that Way is Pavlovian. Cc @OKnox who has best Stones stories.

So true. It’s like my wife. I get off a plane with her and I’m in a fugue state (read or watched movies for hours.) she knows everything - really everything - about the person next to her and oddly it felt like that talk was meant to happen. https://t.co/FvMQ6wtrkD
Pro tip: if you have a photographer in an office-setting interview, always end by asking if they have questions. You have a great journalist brain right next to you - make sure you use it. @Mason_Trinca @mrchavezphoto @bonjomo and others have all taught me this.

This is a talk that is beyond Twitter. Agree in principle that all important institutions should pay something for being here but it does implicate the tax system in these ways: what does the tax code say about American values? What is trying to achieve? We'll have dinner. https://t.co/LCN7fGBUS8

I do not know enough about their reporting requirements, but completely agree with the principle you are proposing. https://t.co/1BetdFRyWY
Fair enough. You've thought about this and have many other ways of making it equitable (not sarcasm.) If there's a way of taxing people/businesses with lots of money the same way we tax people/institutions with no money, I'm all ears. https://t.co/WwA25mi4Ag
I just don't think it achieves, as a policy, anything either side wants. Plus much more.... https://t.co/yBAbx8GbpD
So to pay property tax in San Francisco, for example. Not exempt? Or Manhattan? No churches in any place unaffordable. Does that really achieve the goal? It's an important question you raise but, we give deductions for mortgage interest, dividends, but not a small city church? https://t.co/onlUssVJcV
Sure, but again, certain churches are fine to examine. But the entire tax break for all religious institutions, in my mind goes too far as a proposal. https://t.co/8G9fflMeXe
I'm a Protestant (but have a man crush on Jesuits.) And I believe @Pontifex is trying to get to "a poor church for the poor." My other occupation would have been liberation priest, which my wife sometimes mumbles to herself that she wished I'd pursued more aggressively.
I was in favor of this kind of step against colleges/universities a few years ago, including my own beloved @AmherstCollege. The threat of it awakened the spirit of these places, and I'm very proud of what Amherst has done to improve access since then. A pioneer, as it should be. https://t.co/UNxg3V9hla

Noting that three of Croatia's best players - Rakitic, Mandzukic and Rebic - on yellows and will miss semis if they receive another today. I find this irritating...Here's what I wrote in today's @washingtonpost newsletter: https://t.co/WYr3YWdSbF
I don't understand Guus Hiddink's analysis that "the Russians have to go forward." Why? They didn't against Spain and, in theory, Croatia doesn't play the around-the-box game as well as the Spanish. Seems like Russia has even more reason to sit back and play for penalties.

There is nothing about this Argentina system that is working - and shows no signs of working.

I think today's results - Colombia winning the group - should change "long-term" thinking to "short-term" calculations.

After the first round of group games, I made much about South America's stumbling start (only Uruguay won its first game.) As the group stage ends? Only Peru failed to advance from the continent, and three teams ended up winning their group. Note to self? Patience. #WorldCup
Any rethinking over whether England or Belgium should intentionally tank Group G showdown? I'd much rather face Japan than Colombia next, despite a slightly better match up awaiting in the quarters. So, in other words, I say win now, worry about the next team later.
So Japan advances over Senegal by a yellow card, amazing. Trademark Japanese courtesy rewarded...
As it stands at the half in Group H, it's Senegal and Japan that would advance. No goals in either game.
No penalty - Sanchez got the ball, first. I say, but here we go VAR.

Nothing like a little Balkan edge to a World Cup game. The Serbs face the Swiss, a team featuring key players (Shaqiri, Xhaka, etc) born in what is now Kosovo, bullied by Serbs in the war and today (Serbia refuses to recognize an independent Serbia.) There may be blood.

Ok, I guess. But it is a vapid thing to say. Certainly a 100-0 loss would have been worse for Australia. Just say, "While Australia has lost, the team can take some confidence forward from this game." Then explain why - just because they didn't lose by more goals? Hmmm https://t.co/jL4qRQqV5T
Hey World Cup crowds - follow Jim Brown's advice regarding touchdown celebrations when you get on the Jumbotron: "Act like you've been there before." Sharp contrast between giddy French and stoic Socceroos when it comes to this important point.

I told this to my kids, then re-enacted as I remembered. I thought it was pretty good - then YouTubed it for them, and it was pretty good (maybe a bit dramatized.). But they had no idea why if you liked him/voted for him the "scream" was a problem. And that was it. https://t.co/0nL1YOKj01

Agree with all this. But stumping on a theme, which I agree he did not, and understanding that identity matters even to those on the right is very different. This obtuseness was often raised as his problem - I know better than you, I will wrestle where you should not. IMHO https://t.co/bn22vmdgAm

Fair. But the reason is that Israeli military courts - ie, the Orwellian named “civil authority” - runs the courts in the occupied territories. I don’t disagree that a real (uncorupted) Palestinian justice system must exist post-agreement. https://t.co/i4Bqjl7xFR

Indeed. Those must be guaranteed in a constitution that Israel does not have. This will protect from the Avigdor Lieberman’s of the world.   And the shifting of Palestinians - inside the green line and outside - to military courts when it suits must also be prohibited for peace. https://t.co/S9gkVDhKY1
I believe the answer has always been yes (with caveats) and no - no right of return (except for a symbolic fraction that does not threaten Jewish majority) and yes on voting rights and access to justice system Jewish Israelis have.

Smartest man - by far - in this entire conversation. https://t.co/KkZOjeu6ba
Story to come with sources. Plus not sure what you're objecting too - that Austin residents love home delivery and have been a focus  of home delivery service (Amazon, Instacart) for some time? No one I talked to today disputed that. https://t.co/ScZ6T7xwg9
I give up....Ignorance wins. I cannot argue that every city where Amazon delivers should not be equally terrorized. They don't hate our freedom, they hate our one-click delivery system! Please see eight previous tweets, thanks. https://t.co/pTBj1mPPSe
The Unabomber. Is that your analogue? The Austin bomber is moving around the city, stealing yard signs, stringing trip lines. He's at FedEx offices and he's in neighborhoods. The Unabomber sat in a cabin for decades sporadically mailing bombs out. How is this comparable? https://t.co/Rzr9pV5OjQ
You've lost the thread, dude. Now we're talking supply side economics? Take a break. https://t.co/C3o4O24dG5
I will say this one more time: The popularity of the delivery services is not what drew the bomber (so whether it is more prevalent in LA or Austin is entirely beside the point.) What matters is that it is very popular in Austin - and so a good way to terrorize. Make sense? https://t.co/lwzvrEqaJG
Are you serious? The age we live in is the same as the Unabomber's? My paper printed his entire manifesto as a special insert. If you think the world is the same naive world as then, and the people who want to do what the Austin bomber is doing think the same way, wow. https://t.co/CXEVk8rgSQ

Layer Instacart...It's hard for me to believe I have to explain this to a working journalist, the bomber is not attacking Austin BECAUSE it has an affinity and huge choice of home delivery but he may be using home delivery BECAUSE it is an easy way to terrorize this city. https://t.co/MekcSOuZUh
Of course not. It's that an easy way to terrorize Austin is to use the package delivery service that many Austinites use everyday - just as the subway system is often a target in NYC. Have you covered stuff like this before? https://t.co/2qoG7QwUIy
Yes they are. It goes to the local nature of the knowledge and intent. A place that gets lots of packages, including groceries, delivered and the first two packages exploding on front porches? Kind of surprised this surprises you. https://t.co/JVR5VNj7pM

I’m having a hard time seeing what a trump is trying to do for America in terms of his immigration policy.

No, just trying to explain to you why immigration (and national migration) do not play the role in California’s poverty rate you seem to want them to. https://t.co/zbyoiDLRKJ
Supply is restricted in California to a degree it is not in any other state. By local regulations, state regulations and local referenda. Demand has outstripped it, driven by those not only from abroad but millions from within the USA drawn to its economy, which is booming. https://t.co/UvUGb6b6b2

I'm not pretending, Sean. For insiders, it may be a joke. But you do not need to sell or grow pot in Nipton to have it succeed as a marijuana resort. This is obvious to anyone who visits.

It’s not banned, not sure what you are talking about. Everyone in California will be able to possess and grow small amounts of marijuana. Everywhere. https://t.co/oebbMTTFkh
Hence the line: Nipton is an experiment. No idea if it I’ll work, only that a company is investing. - ie, the promise some see in new cannabis economy. (Just have to read the words, dude.) And you don’t have to sell or grow to be an attraction, just be allowed to possess. https://t.co/YS8IFpxrfS
