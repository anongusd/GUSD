@bknoxmusic Because the Senate races are primarily in very red states, of 17 Senate races with any doubt of outcome at all, 14 are in Trump states. Also other things going on in Govs/Legs. Look at Kansas &amp; Okla govs, very red states, very tough races. School funding key I suspect.
It would appear that Kavanaugh confirmation fight was a “color-enhancing event,” making the “reds” redder &amp; the “blues” bluer.  Helps Democrats in House &amp; Republicans in the Senate.  Will also tend to help Democrats in govs &amp; st legs. Of course the blue wave is really pink.
2/2 Also, the Blue Wave is actually a Pink Wave, powered mostly by turbo-charged women’s vote. Look at gender gap. https://t.co/MX8gccLz5T

@gelliottmorris I think the best way not to point to outliers is to not point to outliers.  There is plenty of data out there to wait for averages or more consistent/regular polls to come out.  Forget missing the forest for the trees, there is a good bit of looking at individual pieces of bark.
@gelliottmorris I have no doubt that Democrats are both ahead on the generic ballot test by seven points or more and have an enthusiasm advantage but it really is nice to look at averages or compare apples to apples (same pollster/methodology), anything else smacks of cherry-picking.  This does.
