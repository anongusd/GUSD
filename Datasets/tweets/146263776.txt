@s_noble82 @libertybellemll @mthead141 @Sierra_Marlee @garbinat0r @Nicki_F @nk_prof @RepAOC @AOC I fully agree.   The biggest problem I see now a days is that folks have forgotten how to have a good conversation about things.   We don't have to agree on everything and if we don't, it doesn't mean we can't be friends.  We just agree to disagree in places.
@s_noble82 @libertybellemll @mthead141 @Sierra_Marlee @garbinat0r @Nicki_F @nk_prof @RepAOC @AOC I have confidence it will happen only because it has - I think- always happened.    I don't think there has been a shutdown where Congress didnt provide retro active pay - but could be wrong in that.   The tough part is that there are no guarantees it will but history helps.
@s_noble82 @libertybellemll @mthead141 @Sierra_Marlee @garbinat0r @Nicki_F @nk_prof @RepAOC @AOC This next  check will only be a partial if there is one at all.  You do what you can to prepare.  Watching the news and seeing this sort of thing coming definately helps.   I have honestly been waiting on this to happen since the end of this past  August.  The signs were there.
@s_noble82 @libertybellemll @mthead141 @Sierra_Marlee @garbinat0r @Nicki_F @nk_prof @RepAOC @AOC @s_noble82.  Really appreciate the question.   I and my family are doing fine.    We have been thru these before.    However, I do have friends who are pretty nervous about this weekend and how they are going to make ends meet.   It does help that the last check was a full one
@s_noble82 @libertybellemll @mthead141 @Sierra_Marlee @garbinat0r @Nicki_F @nk_prof @RepAOC @AOC The challenge is being paid retro actively isnf guaranteed.   It really is up to Congress to pass a bill as part of the funding allowing the retro active pay.  How/if that happens really depends on what Congress places in the bill.
@s_noble82 @libertybellemll @mthead141 @Sierra_Marlee @garbinat0r @Nicki_F @nk_prof @RepAOC @AOC Yes.  However the only other experience I have with this that comes close was the 16 day shutdown during the Obama administration.    Very similar from a pay perspective but when the shutdown was over, everyone was paid retro actively.

@FishWithDan NP.  :-)
@FishWithDan yep.  Has proven to be an effective block.  Otherwise the partial shutdown likely would be over.
@FishWithDan only the majority leader (cantor) or his designee.
@FishWithDan this change blocked dems from being able to bring the "clean" cr to the floor for a vote.
@FishWithDan there's a provision in the existing house rules that allow anyone to bring a bill up 4 vote in times of crisis.
@FishWithDan this is accurate.   They changed the rules as of Oct 1 of this year.
@robertcostaNRO going to be interesting to see how the markets react to this tomorrow.
@holliemaea true.  They tried after the fiscal cliff and couldnt stick together on that well enough to get it done
@holliemaea agreed.  Its more of a waiting game to see what happens. You have to think that someone will eventually blink.
@holliemaea likely not. But have enuf to significantly impact current process. Just don't think they had a well thought out strategy.
@holliemaea @robertcostaNRO @daveweigel @meredithshiner unfortunately have enough to hamstring this thing.  Don't seem to have a strategy.
@holliemaea figure if boehner caves the hard liners may try it.  Don't know if they would have the votes or not.
@robertcostaNRO @daveweigel @meredithshiner GOP could replace him with someone that takes an even harder line.
@robertcostaNRO @daveweigel @meredithshiner kind of a devil ya know vs the devil you don't know in terms of breaking boehner.
