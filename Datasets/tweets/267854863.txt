Now that we know what's in the #GOPTaxPlan, what cuts/eliminations concern you the most about the bill?
Overall, the #GOPTaxPlan is heartless.  Raising taxes for middle-class families, taking away vital tax deductions, and cutting funding to Medicare &amp; Medicaid just doesn't sound like a plan that benefits hard-working Americans.
@FAFSA With college tuition increasing every year, the federal government must do more to help students that are drowning in student debt.
The 2nd major tax deduction the #GOPTaxPlan will cut is the student loan deduction. In 2016, @FAFSA reported that 544,000 individuals in Louisiana have student loans.
It's a shame that the #GOPTaxPlan eliminates the medical expense deduction. This allows deductions for preventive care treatments, surgeries, dental and vision expenses, and long-term care for chronically ill citizens. https://t.co/qeABKoxTqT
The #GOPTaxPlan will put an unfair burden on working families to give tax breaks to the wealthy. Low and middle-income families will lose vital tax deductions that help they survive day-to-day. https://t.co/aXaztRmTRk

This #BillionairesFirst tax plan will do NOTHING to help middle &amp; low-income families in Louisiana. This is why I will continue 2 speak out.
The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) has helped 141,000 Louisianans, including 82,000 children. It helps families afford day-to-day expenses
While the wealthiest households in LA will enjoy this tax break, low-income families will see the EITC under attack. #GOPBudget
In 2015, 1,425,290 dependent exemptions were claimed in Louisiana. Proving LA families are in need of personal exemptions.
The #GOPBudget will raise taxes for 235,000 LA families &amp; ELIMINATE personal exemptions which deduct $4,050 for each taxpayer &amp; dependent.
We are still gearing up 2 vote on the #GOPBudget this week &amp; the GOP tax plan won't be good 4 LA families. GOP is putting #BillionairesFirst
