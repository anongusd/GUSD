@JYuter What compromise?
@RadioFreeTom @Knocksious @J4Years @xan_desanctis @MollyJongFast @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz Some “pro-lifers” use their views almost like baptismal waters, cleansing them of other sins. But the pro-life movement I know is fundamentally different. It cherishes life from conception to natural death. What we do now is a supremely challenging question, with no clear answer.
@RadioFreeTom @Knocksious @J4Years @xan_desanctis @MollyJongFast @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz Anyway, I don’t want The Bulwark to fail. I want it to succeed! Conservatism, conserved is a great mission. I don’t want them to fire anybody. Molly is a talented writer, and I’ve appreciated her work in other contexts. How we defend life matters more to me than this little spat.
@RadioFreeTom @Knocksious @J4Years @xan_desanctis @MollyJongFast @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz I appreciate the discussion, but I don’t think that’s Alexandra’s point. Some of the pro-life folks at CPAC are great folks, with real convictions. Different people reach different conclusions in good faith about how to engage. It’s a hard time. A little grace is good.
@RadioFreeTom @Knocksious @J4Years @xan_desanctis @MollyJongFast @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz I like and respect lots of folks at the Bulwark. It’s a new publication, and everyone makes mistakes. We have an enduring mistake at NR in keeping D’Souza on the masthead. But Alexandra was spot-on, and it’s been great seeing the well-deserved tributes to her today.

@J_Braceras I agree with you, but the Department of Education has required these adjudications under a misreading of Title IX.
Part of the Trumpist project is the mystifying tendency to treat other Republicans before him as failures who failed to conserve anything — as if Trump somehow taught us to win. False. False. False.
I appreciate Trump’s pro-life actions, but he can’t yet match GWB. Bush:	1) Signed 2002 born-alive act	2) Signed 2003 partial-birth abortion ban	3) Appointed 330 lower-court judges	4) Appointed 2 SCOTUS justices who have pro-life records	5) Reinstated Mexico City policy.
@RadioFreeTom @xan_desanctis @MollyJongFast @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz I’ve been around the pro-life movement long enough (basically my entire adult life) to know beyond a shadow of a doubt that many (not all) of the pro-life voices at CPAC are as sincere as you’ll ever find.
@RadioFreeTom @xan_desanctis @MollyJongFast @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz We can’t be so reflexively defensive. I get that NR also makes mistakes. I make mistakes. My point is super-simple. One way to conserve conservatism is to praise what’s good along with criticizing what’s bad. CPAC’s stance on life is good.
@RadioFreeTom @xan_desanctis @MollyJongFast @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz This isn’t hard. If NR sent a talented progressive writer to cover CPAC, and she attacked even the few good conservative things about that infernal convention, we’d deserve critique from pro-life folks.
@RadioFreeTom @xan_desanctis @MollyJongFast @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz No one’s feelings are hurt. It’s just a conversation about whether attacking CPAC’s pro-life stance is a good thing for a conservative publication to do — goodness knows there are plenty of other things to critique.

@drvox Question: Can celebrity Christians attend the Catholic Church and hold to the Catholic Catechism without public censure? Or is it now the responsibility of social justice advocates to call out every Christian in public life who attends an orthodox Church? If so, censure me now.
@cjane87 We don’t even know Chris Pratt’s view on Obergefell. There are plenty of Christians who hold to traditional Christian teaching on sex but also believed in legal gay marriage. But even if he disagreed with Obergefell he can work with dissenting colleagues.
@cjane87 I’m sure you do. My basic contention is that when people who have profound religious differences can work together in an atmosphere of fairness and respect, then we shouldn’t be rooting around for evidence of all their wrongthink and trying to shame them into conformity.

@PYNance Football isn't a good fit for every kid, but to affirmatively steer your kid away from it because of overblown risks is a bad idea. There is a real temptation for parents to dwell too much on their fears, and fear-based parenting can have its own negative effects.
@rayortlund Well said.
@ZanderKelly30 The risks for youth and high school football are wildly overblown. To read my replies, one would think I let my son play Russian Roulette. It's more dangerous than basketball, but it's far less dangerous than the propaganda implies.
@CharlesPPierce You just forwarded me an article about the long-term consequences of playing high school football that says this: https://t.co/p9UI2AN6Ew
@CharlesPPierce Yeah, because dementia at age 38 is a totally common side-effect of high school football. Much of the fear about particularly football at the high school level is wildly overblown. There is a massive difference between playing through high school and playing professionally.
I strongly disagree with Trump's timidity about his son playing football. My son played, and it helped mold him into the young man that he is. Fear-based parenting can breed timid, fearful kids. Some thoughts, from a couple years ago: https://t.co/qO8p4GLhAo

Here's the latest in my war of attrition FBI debate with @RichLowry. Congress should investigate the president, but so should the agency that Congress created and abundantly-resourced for precisely the purpose of conducting counterintelligence activities: https://t.co/K7TN6D3s9X
@ThePlumLineGS Yes, I was extremely intrigued by the assertion in December that Cohen's prepared testimony had been circulated. Who saw it? Did they make edits? Is there a written record of edits/suggestions/instructions?
@Popehat @jillathrilla In my piece I say that there can and should be robust, intense debate. I object to the claim that Christian sexual ethics are rooted in hate. The incorrect assertion that a person is hateful (rather than just wrong) when they're motivated by love is the source of much mischief.
@jillathrilla Are Democrats bigots if they exclude Republicans from their party? Are Muslims bigots if they don't want a rabbi leading their mosque? The school is a ministry of a church. It's not bigoted for a church ministry to want to reinforce the church's values.
Yes, there are Christian bigots in this world. But traditional, orthodox Christian sexual ethics are grounded in love, not hate. Accusations of bigotry aren't merely false, when used as weapons against Christians, they're often instruments of injustice: https://t.co/a2vRgtCiSP
@arthurbrooks @PostOpinions Wonderful news! Congratulations!
It is intriguing that we have a flat-out declaration from Cohen's legal team that the false statements to Congress were "in accordance with Client-1's directives." Is that a mistaken assertion? /end
This is an interesting statement, from Cohen's sentencing statement:		"I was weak for not having the strength to question and to refuse his demands." /3 https://t.co/M8lLaZeyB8
Then, later his team makes this statement, which indicates that Cohen was wanting to support Trump's public messaging and does not detail a specific Trump directive. It does, however, say he remained in close contact with WH staff and legal counsel. That's more ambiguous. /2 https://t.co/UnUd2FmLEG

@TheAlanNoble @saletan What Alan said. Moreover, the relevant question isn’t whether orientation is a choice. The question is how are we commanded to live. All of us are required in various ways to put aside the desires of the flesh. Moral law exists regardless of desire.
@saletan Marriage isn’t an orientation; it’s an act. And the idea that a person isn’t defined as male or female by their biology isn’t just an orientation, it’s a belief.

@seanmdav I got the movie right, its cultural resonance right, and its application to Donald Trump and some of his worst defenders right. I wasn’t writing a treatise on the term’s use in an academic paper. Your framing of my piece is thoroughly inaccurate.
@seanmdav In fact, the first time I ever heard the wolf/sheepdog/sheep construct was way back in 1996, and it was used in the context of describing an effective civil court litigator. Even then it had larger cultural framing.
@seanmdav As evidenced of course by the actual anecdote in the movie, which was framed around a moment of garden-variety schoolyard bullying, not around the decision to shoot or not shoot in combat.
@seanmdav But I accurately state the cultural resonance of the moment in conservative America and the larger popularization of it in conservative culture. Its origin was military. Its adaptation and expansion went far beyond its original context.

I agree @WilcoxNMP on much. We agree on the gravity of the crisis. We agree that we’re seeing massive cultural/economic shifts. We may disagree about populism. We may also disagree on the extent to which gov’t policy can help. But he’s still awesome and I learn much from him. /x
If you meet a young man from a rural county (like the KY county I grew up in or the TN county I raised my kids in), what do you tell him has the most impact on his future? His choices? Elite choices? Government policy? It’s his choices, and it’s not close. /19
Remember these Springsteen lyrics from “My Hometown”? Haunting. This isn’t from 2019. It’s from 1984: /18 https://t.co/jCpqD4WmvR
There are policies that help or hurt, but great minds have been trying to figure this out for a really long time. I remember the shock of the closing mills and plants in the Eighties. We’ve talked tax credits, retraining, marriage, family, education for generations. /17
We know how people can enjoy upward mobility. We don’t know how government can systematically improve the mobility of people who don’t finish their education and have children out of wedlock. And we don’t know how government can motivate the success sequence at scale.  /16
So we have a number of HUGE changes in American cultural life, one of which is a collapse in marriage culture that is self-defeating and helps make poverty stickier, and the populist says that elites are to blame and government can fix it. This is just flat-out wrong. /15
We can’t forget that our upper-middle-class is growing (something I mention in my piece), and one of the reasons why it grows is that of course people from lower economic classes who demonstrate certain core disciplines enter the upper-middle-class at scale. /14
For example, here’s the illustrious @WilcoxNMP noting that poor millennials who follow the “success sequence” are upwardly mobile. /13 https://t.co/xs3NPgUqp0
Who was most able to respond and succeed in this environment? People who resisted the siren call of sexual revolution excess, and who dug in and finished at the very least their high school education. In fact, these qualities lead to considerable upward mobility. /12
So we get a shifting workforce because of civil rights/feminism, a more competitive manufacturing environment, changing personal morality, and immense growth in new industries that require different skill sets. /11
On top of this, we get a sexual revolution. Yes, that had immense elite backing, but it was adopted with extreme enthusiasm across social classes and over the strenuous objections of Protestant/Catholic religious leaders who sounded warning bells as loudly as they could. /10
(My family bought Dodge cars in the 1970s, and they were horrifyingly bad. I’ll never forget the amazement of buying a Toyota and never having to take it to the shop.) /9
Oh, and we also can’t forget that some American manufacturers (in all their immense power) became complacent and arrogant. They made inferior products and then screamed “buy American” when families purchased products that were best for their lives. /8
This isn’t elite spite or indifference. It’s economic reality. Even the best policies would have merely tinkered at the edges of these tectonic shifts. /7
Productivity gains also meant that we could (and do) produce more with less. But if we didn’t become more productive we’d even be less competitive. Simply put, we could not possibly freeze in amber the golden age of American manufacturing. /6
As for the previous ascendancy of American manufacturing, never forget we gained immense strength as many of the world’s most advanced societies were in ruins after WWII. When they recovered, they became extremely competitive. /5.
The civil rights revolution (a bottom-up movement) changed the nation in good ways, but it’s still a change. Feminism changed the nation in good and bad ways. The Information Age changed the nature of skills and training necessary to be economically competitive /4.
Elites aren’t irrelevant, but the Carlson focus on elites is just wrong. It’s factually wrong and has its own negative consequences as it focuses popular anger an energy away from the things that are most likely to help any given family succeed /3.
First I’m a bit mystified by his assertion that I underplay the “major economic, political, civic &amp; cultural forces” in the fall of our working class. What I reject is the populist focus on elites in Tucker’s piece. Here’s what I say in my piece /2: https://t.co/9LD7AOnemy

@owillis Hmmm, look elsewhere for your hypocrisy. I want to social media companies to voluntarily adopt First Amendment principles. I don't want government intervention.
@Popehat I honestly think that for a time Twitter and Facebook thought that they could have their cake and eat it too. They could 1) create a platform for all people; 2) encourage engagement and dialogue; 3) get rich AND 4) change the world in a specific way. They got 1-3, not 4.
@Popehat It depends in my view on the purpose of the platform. If the platform is designed to express an ideological view then freedom of association &gt; freedom of expression. But Twitter is ostensibly creating a marketplace of ideas. Then freedom of expression &gt; freedom of association.
Yup, this is a move that will echo beyond Twitter. Each major corporate move in this direction reinforces the notion that there is nothing left to discuss and that enraged activists can and should exercise veto power over public debate. https://t.co/seIc9D66xf

@JohnEkdahl Interesting thought.
When Silicon Valley idealists spoke of “changing the world,” for most the last thing on their mind was making the world more conservative or advancing the right more broadly. So, when that happens, the pressure for corrective action is overwhelming. /end
But there is immense progressive peer pressure to make sure that Twitter/Facebook are instruments of progressive social change. The idea that progressives build platforms that conservatives successfully use to advance their ideas is intolerable to some. 3/
Social media platforms should be run on First Amendment principles, and participants who complain about toxic public voices should be reminded they have mute and block options. 2/
So, about this Jesse Kelly thing . . . 		Twitter should be transparent, especially for prominent public accounts. He’s a radio host and former candidate for public office. The silence raises the inference that he was banned for reasons that can’t withstand public scrutiny. 1/

I don’t have a political answer. We need Jesus! But those of us who are targets can resolve to keep speaking the truth without fear or favor. We can resolve to show compassion to our opponents. They’re likely fighting a hard battle. Seek justice. Love mercy. Walk humbly. /end
It’s sad to see the withering contempt online when journalists and others share their fears. Read Twitter and see that thousands of people _want_ their ideological opponents to feel fear. A darkness is gripping people’s hearts. /10
And others have had it so much worse. It’s intolerable that Christine Blasey Ford is still under threat. It’s intolerable that Brett Kavanaugh’s family was under threat. Many of us don’t have the resources to hire security. We can buy firearms. We can’t hire guards. /9
I’ve not dwelled on the “normal” dreck that includes such delightful things as daily petty insults, occasional mockery of my wife’s sex abuse when she was a kid, and periodic attacks on us for adopting. That’s the typical price of online engagement. /8
Then, yesterday (as I’ve tweeted), we found out that the Trump superfan mail bomber searched for my home address. /7
Like lots of folks, we got a very worrisome email threat, but unlike lots of others, we actually had someone break into a phone call between my wife and father-in-law. He screamed obscenities about Donald Trump. We have no idea how he did this. /6
The worst of the alt-right attacks came the night they filled the comments section of my wife’s blog with gruesome images of dead and dying African-Americans. I couldn’t sleep for days, fearing for my daughter’s safety. /5
We had a period of peace, but then in 2015 (as I’ve written about before), the alt-right targeted us, focusing on my youngest daughter (she was seven at the time), She’s adopted from Ethiopia, and they targeted her for vicious, racist attacks. /4
The next major incident was a probable SWATing attempt. I was involved in a First Amendment matter against a person suspected to engage in such tactics, and someone made a “shots fired” call. Fortunately, we warned the police this might happen, and they responded calmly. /3
The first scary incident happened about five years ago, A man drove to my house, blocked our driveway, approached my wife (with my kids present) and demanded to see me. He was also seen driving slowly through the parking lot at my kids’ school. /2

@ianbassin State polling? I know national polling is negative, but in TN the Kavanaugh battle energized the GOP.
If the GOP extends its Senate lead, that’s crucial to guarantee judicial confirmations for the rest of Trump’s first term, and it would have serious implications for a Dem president’s nominees. 		I wonder . . . If the House had any role in judges would the Dems have done so well?

This doesn’t mean there’s any affection for the Dems’ increasing extremism on immigration, but it’s dispiriting in the face of a booming economy and success against ISIS to be fighting stupid battles over the “threat” of a diminishing caravan we can handle with ease.

@BenjySarlin @HashtagGriswold Steve Bannon and Breitbart did great harm in attempting to mainstream parts of the alt-right. They sold them as a merry band of pro-Trump trolls when they were vile and evil. I’m not surprised he had fans at CPAC. Nothing much surprises me about CPAC.
@BenjySarlin @HashtagGriswold The pro-Trump alt-right white nationalist community seems to be splintering a bit — some believe Trump isn’t delivering what they hoped.		But the Pittsburgh guy was never on the Trump Train. 		He reminds me more of the string of white supremacist shooters that pre-date Trump.
A key reason I wrote the piece below.		The alt-right Trump superfan community is one thing.		The anti-Trump racist community is different in important ways. 		Too many people are losing the thread on the former by trying to link him to the latter.		https://t.co/iHDfuPdPMk

@BenjySarlin @HashtagGriswold I think “Soros-funded Middle Eastern-infiltrated crime caravan” is gross and stupid and conspiratorial. It’s all those things regardless of whether it motivated a murder.
@BenjySarlin @HashtagGriswold A Trump superfan attacking people specifically targeted by Trump is very different than a Trump-hater attacking people Trump did not target. I’m dubious of “climate” arguments, especially after seeing his Gab. It’s way beyond any mainstream climate.
@BenHowe @BenjySarlin @AdamSerwer There is no Nathan in that bunch.
@BenjySarlin @HashtagGriswold And do you not see how people straining straining straining to tie Trump to the Pittsburgh shooter has now contributed to the submergence of the story about bomber -- an actual Trump superfan radicalized into the Trump troll community who attacked Trump's named enemies?
@BenjySarlin @AdamSerwer There are lots of reasons for Trump to engage in soul-searching, but it's far more meaningful to ask him to soul-search when we can see the effect his rhetoric actually had than by reaching to tie other terrible things to him.
@BenjySarlin @AdamSerwer The caravan was news everywhere. Heck, MSNBC made the caravan its Twitter banner. And the guy had contempt for Trump. He wasn't following Trump's lead. Why are people reaching so desperately to tie Trump to this attack? Not everything is about him.
@BenjySarlin "Minus the reference to Jews" is a rather big caveat. But we don't need to read tea leaves. The guy was obsessed with HIAS and hated that Jews welcome refugees not because he made up that fact but because he was that evil. He hated Jews for their good works.
@BenjySarlin @AdamSerwer If you read the guy's Gab feed, he was such a pure hater that he didn't need a caravan conspiracy theory to be triggered. He was triggered by news of Jewish compassion and good works. He'd read a HIAS report and get enraged. I haven't seen evidence Trump triggered that fury.

@RadioFreeTom @JRubinBlogger @brithume I think I got cc’d into your thread because of this tweet in a different thread: https://t.co/b9nQ59bu7b
@RadioFreeTom @JRubinBlogger @brithume And yes of course that’s stupid and evil, which sums up all too much of Fox’s content.
@RadioFreeTom @JRubinBlogger @brithume Tom, thanks to the limitations of Twitter threading, this is coming up in the context of a different conversation — as to whether Fox shares “responsibilty” for the killing. I’m not willing to say so without evidence, even if too much of its content is dreadful.
@matthewjdowd @brithume @RichLowry There are many reasons for the rise. And we should condemn anti-Semitism unequivocally and in all its forms. But it’s not too much to ask to use caution in deciding who else has responsibility for a mass murder.
@JRubinBlogger @RadioFreeTom @brithume Lou Dobbs is a disgrace, but I’d be very careful before I attribute to any media figure responsibility for a mass murder without evidence.
@matthewjdowd @ElieFinegold @RichLowry @brithume The caravan was covered on every major news outlet. There’s no evidence I’ve seen that anyone on Fox radicalized him. I’m not defending all of Fox’s content (it’s too often stupid and reprehensible), but to argue they share responsibility for a mass murder is a bridge way too far

@brithume @RichLowry @matthewjdowd Matt that's deeply unfair to accuse Fox of any complicity in murders by people of that ilk.

TLDR — Based on available evidence (important caveat) these two terrorists are not the same. Unless the evidence changes, if you’re lumping them together, you’re making a serious mistake. /end
If you’re equating the two — if you’re finding comments on Fox or in Trump’s speeches that Nazis like — then you’re just reaching. These people aren’t evil because of Fox &amp; Friends. Their hatred runs bone-deep. It’s way outside and beyond even our hyper-polarized politics. /5
I’ve had sadly all too much experience with the alt-right Trump superfans. But when this other community emerges, things get so very much darker. /4
BUT it is NOT THE SAME as the pre-existing, hideously evil Nazi/White supremacist community that has long committed acts of violence in this country and will sadly exist after Trump is gone. These people come straight from the gates of hell. /3
There does exist a scary Trump superfan community (mostly alt-right) that is responsible for an astounding level of harasssment and threats against Trump critics — and for isolated acts of violence. This is very, very real. /2

@mattyglesias The honest way of looking at her results is that they confirm she misrepresented herself for years.
@jonathanchait You’re confusing “defensive” with mocking.		No one made her launch a media campaign that only reaffirmed how much she’d misled employers and voters about her heritage. That was her choice.

@jeffbercovici @jbouie My piece states a difference between 1A-protected activity and illegal activity that includes actual violence, threats of violence, acts of physical intimidation, and disruptions. It’s a pretty clear line.
@jbouie @jeffbercovici Maxine Waters’s speech was protected, many of the mob actions inspired by it are not. The issue in my piece was about the danger of mob action and how whataboutism distracts from that danger.
@jbouie And that’s of course just as protected as, say, a chant that says, “No justice, no peace” even though it implies violence if demands aren’t met.
@jbouie I’m speaking of the chants at his rallies. The crowd.
@BenjySarlin @Popehat @jonathanchait I forgot it by actually mentioning that it was right to condemn him for calling for violence?
@jbouie There is a categorical difference between activity that is and isn’t protected by the First Amendment. That’s not throat-clearing. That’s fundamental.
@ThePlumLineGS As you know I’ve written about that a million times. The question here is whether intimidating, threatening, and menacing mob action is wrong. It is. And pointing to rally chants is a poor way to divert from that fact.

@BrianGMattson Deal!
@JessicaHuseman It’s not just an interview. There are claims he committed crimes. He’s not just arguing for a SCOTUS seat, but also for his good name and for his family. The interview analogy is flawed. How many of us “interview” with sworn testimony after a national search for our sins?
@JessicaHuseman That’s a different question from the point of my tweet, which was to urge an end to the public inquiry into the sex life of a young woman in 1982. But his obligation is to tell the truth, and our subjective judgments about his veracity aren’t a substitute for real evidence.

@BrettHamil @matthewjdowd @BillWeirCNN @NancyAFrench @feministabulous @Josh_Moon The answer, in the case of Swetnick, appears to be a transparent effort to advance a false claim to smear Brett Kavanaugh at a crucial time. That’s the why now in the gang rape allegation.
@BillWeirCNN @NancyAFrench @matthewjdowd @feministabulous @Josh_Moon @BrettHamil The allegation was about a series of gang rapes at parties where there would be many, many non-victim witnesses. The allegation was wildly implausible on its face. My post was about _those_ facts. And you knew it. But you piled on and gave aid and comfort to a gross smear.
@BrettHamil @matthewjdowd @NancyAFrench @feministabulous @Josh_Moon @BillWeirCNN It wasn’t just about victims. It was about non-victim witnesses at an (alleged) series of gang rapes at parties attended by dozens, if not hundreds, of people. It was a wild allegation, and you covered for it.

My first take assessment of Ford’s testimony:		She told her story without effective cross examination. That has a powerful emotional effect. That could change everything.		But she changed nothing about the evidence. This is still a thinly-supported claim: https://t.co/xRuIhmrTxM
I don’t see how any lawyer alive could effectively cross-examine a witness when interrupted every five minutes by tributes to the valor and virtue of the witness. I supported bringing in competent outside counsel. This format drains that decision of any worth.
This: https://t.co/TYlqnkhBE4
Was just asked why Mitchell hasn’t asked much about the incident. With no other witness testifying that they were there, the only person with testimony about the alleged incident is Dr. Ford. Asking questions without grounds for cross is problematic. This isn’t a deposition.

@matthewjdowd @Sajizzle Gang rape is a crime that deserves life in prison (death penalty, really), I need more than what we have for me to believe Kavanaugh is guilty of participating or facilitating. And years-old news articles about wild parties that don’t mention rapes aren’t evidence. You know that.
@matthewjdowd Point me to the part about gang rape.
It all started with a photograph. And many of the other allegations were bolstered by contemporaneous corroboration. Evidence matters. https://t.co/jCIudBVAIX
“Believe victims” is a toxic ideology. You respect alleged victims by hearing and diligently investigating claims, not by believing them regardless of the state of the evidence. That disrespects the person on the receiving end of the claim. /End.
The gang rape allegation never would have made it into print in any respectable newspaper. She made dramatic claims that would have been witnessed by dozens of people. Yet none have been found or quoted. Many peers say these kinds of things did not happen. /4
The New Yorker allegation features someone who needed attorney help to “access” her memories, still claims gaps, reportedly claimed uncertainty even to friends as she looked for corroboration. No one else reports the event happened. /3
And keep in mind, especially in the Ford allegation, these are witnesses she identified, including a friend of hers. /2

@samuelhensen @AlanLevinovitz Gang rape is not normalized with prep school boys. That’s batshit crazy.
@AlanLevinovitz The claim is that the rapes were quite public. She says she saw the trains. Reporters have been talking to men and women who went to school with Kavanaugh for months. The gang rapes are just now coming up? From one person? That makes no sense at all.
@robbysoave If we’re talking about a person saying Kavanaugh harassed or abused her, yes. But her claim is that there were multiple gang rapes, and many many witnesses. And no one said anything about it for more than 30 years. No. Just no.
@AlanLevinovitz Running a “train” on an incapacitated girl is gang rape.
@AlanLevinovitz Yes, gang rapes happen. Now find me a story of the secretly-uncovered, 30 year-old gang rape ring, featuring children of privilege — never found out even though MSM reporters are contacting all their classmates. And never found out through six FBI background checks.
@McCormackJohn And many, many other witnesses who would have seen the “trains” form outside the door.
@TWSTCU @robbysoave I know he is. That’s why I responded. I would agree with him if we were talking about pre-Meritor v. Vinson sexual harassment, but this is gang rape we’re talking about. And it’s alleged to have happened multiple time, with lots of witnesses.

The available evidence simply doesn’t meet any conceivable burden of proof. It’s difficult — especially given the extraordinary passage of time and the admitted memory gaps — to argue even that the claims meet a threshold of "credible." https://t.co/D1lPHl2jPM
I’ve litigated a long time, and it is extremely odd for accusers to put forward the names of alleged first-hand witnesses of key events, only to have _all_ of them fail to corroborate their story. https://t.co/qvVj91o28f
RT @SouthernKeeks: This. This. This. https://t.co/g6hQnQYucG
A vitally important fact: There is not a single third-party witness to any claim that can corroborate any accuser or even conclusively place Kavanaugh at the location of any alleged crime. Yet we're supposed to believe he's a predator? No: https://t.co/D1lPHl2jPM

There are two key questions:		1) Are the allegations serious? Yes, absolutely. 		2) Is their sufficient supporting evidence to block the nomination?  I’m unconvinced.		I’m sure Nancy and Alexandra have their own thoughts on point 2, but there’s no daylight between us on point 1.
Both Nancy and Alexandra were responding to the continued argument (most notoriously made by Dennis Prager) that even if true the allegations weren’t disqualifying. I stand with Nancy and Alexandra 100 percent on their responses to that argument /3

I think the better analysis goes like this: The claims are serious. Memory can be capricious. Is there corroboration? It was the corroboration that helped make the claims against Roy Moore so compelling, for example. /end.
A number of progressives have done serious work showing that memory is capricious and fickle. We throw people in jail on the basis of testimony that's far less reliable than we often think. But for some, it's now "She didn't lie. The facts are seared in her brain." /3
Law-and-order conservatives have long advocating trying older teens as adults if the crime is serious enough. It's a serious position, worth considering. Yet now I'm seeing law-and-order types all over Twitter using a version of the "young and stupid" defense they often hate. /2

Two things are true at once:		1) The perpetrator is responsible for his own actions.		2) Overheated rhetoric helps rationalize violent acts.		When “speech is violence,” isn’t self-defense appropriate?		When it’s a “Flight 93 election” won’t some folks believe lives are at stake?

I’m writing about this, but just so you know, this *does not* exonerate her. At that moment, she is not a cop clothed with the authority of the state. She is nothing but an armed home invader, a criminal in another man’s home. Her commands are incriminating, not exonerating. https://t.co/OUoBiACPjo
