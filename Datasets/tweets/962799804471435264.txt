#MyTwitterAnniversary		One year has past since I started to tweet about SUMO .	These days I am loosing interest for SUMO .	I am struggling about what should I tweet . https://t.co/MzXjohHQSX
Yesterday , there was a ceremony called “DANPATSUSHIKI” held at KOKUGIKAN , where SUMO matches are held on January , May , September .	This danpatushiki means same as retirement ceremony .	This ceremony was for TAKANOIWA .	Thus the endeth an assault case .
@asherlaub I am strugglinng about that .	This account was started to announce about the problems of SUMO world .	For me , pathetically ended .	Do you have any suggestion ？
A HAPPY NEW YEAR ！		This is a Japanese greeting postcard for NEW YEAR .	I wish the WORLD will be happy , this year .		with best wishes . https://t.co/Ml8zJ0u0vy

@gadgadz @muunn886984 Hi .	Well , it's really hard for me to answer your question on Twitter .	So many reasons , I believe .		Governance , not work .	Try to conseal the bad incidents.	Ability less executive directors.	The organization maneuver behind SUMO.	Their motive , money and power .	Complicated.

#SUMO_DARKSIDE 	#TOPIC 		Today , Nihon Sumo Kyoukai tweeted to attack for resigned TAKANOHANA personally , quoted the article written by FAKE MEDIA .	Attack for resighed person personally ！	NSK must to lose humanity or operated by EVILDOER .	Significant defamation ！	Erased now. https://t.co/IPoDSfCwvx
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 	#TAKANOHANA_RESIGN 25		TAKANOHANA gave advice not to forget representation of appreciation to TAKANOIWA .	That was opening gate to hell .	Unpredictable catastrophe was waiting him .		PHOTOS	LEFT：ISHIURA FATHER	RIGHT UP：ISHIURA SON	RIGHT DOWN：SHINNICHI HAMAZAKI https://t.co/zw3o1WC2V0
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 	#TAKANOHANA_RESIGN 24		The victim TAKANOIWA was a guraduate of ISHIURA's high school .	He was invited from ISHIURA , and consult for his master TAKANOHANA .	TAKANOHANA gave permission for  his apprentice to visit ISHIURA , and also advised not to forget thank him.
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 	#TAKANOHANA_RESIGN 23		Who were at the crime scene .		ISHIURA's Father who is principal of Tottori Jyouhoku High School .	SHINNICHI HAMAZAKI who is a Tottori Prefectural Assembly Member .		Bad point of this case was no one tried to stop HARUMAFUJI.	Even Principal.
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 	#TAKANOHANA_RESIGN 22		This ASASYOURYU's incident much different from HARUMAFUJI case .	HARUMAFUJI case was seemed like lynching .	There were other RIKISHI at the crime scene .	YOKOZUNA HAKUHOU	YOKOZUNA KAKURYU	OOZEKI TERUNOFUJI(also lynched)	RIKISHI ISHIURA
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 	#TAKANOHANA_RESIGN 21		The man ASASHOURYU beated was people like an apprentice of YAKUZA . As you know YAKUZA is member of BOURYOKUDAN like MAFIA , criminal organization .	That's why I cannot say absolutely  ASASYOURYU was bad .	Later , that man also convicted .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE	#TAKANOHANA_RESIGN 20		On January 2010 , when ❛HATSU-BASHO❜ was held , an assault case was reported .	The suspect was ASASHOURYU .	By this incident , ASASHOURYU had to resign .	And ASASHOURYU was covicted .	This case , I cannot say　ASASHOURYU was 100% bad .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 	#TAKANOHANA_RESIGN 19		Explanation photos .	LEFT：HARUMAFUJI kissing to DO-HYOU.	RIGHT ＵＰ：68th YOKOZUNA ASASHOURYU was kissing to HARUMAFUJI .	RIGHT DOWN：69th YOKOZUNA HAKUHOU was kissing to harumafuji .	All of them are Mongols .		Also ASASYOURYU was CRIMINAL. https://t.co/TI5Fq3hQzH
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 	#TAKANOHANA_RESIGN 18		Incredibly NSK gave permission to use Kokugikan for harumafuji , and many RIKISHI joined to the ceremony .	Conviction went down for HARUMAFUJI , as criminal for assault case .	It seems like NSK celebrate CRIME and praise the CRIMINAL .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 	#TAKANOHANA_RESIGN 17		This kind of ceremony held to celebrate one's achievement and to thank for one's contribution for organization .	What HARUMAFUJI done was crime . The reason of the crime was that victim was non-cooperative for set-up matches .	Celebrate ？
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 	#TAKANOHANA_RESIGN 16		On 30th September , at Ryougoku-Kokugikan , where the gymnasium Sumo Competition always held , a retirement ceremony of HARUMAFUJI was held.	This HARUMAFUJI was the SUSPECT of murder attempt for TAKANOIWA case.	This event should not be held.
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 	#TAKANOHANA_RESIGN 15		The Cabinet Office told to the press , they did not taught to NSK for how to use the Grant Money .	In this the Cabinet Office would not lie .	Also HAKKAKU , who is the chief of directors said terrible thing .	TAKANOHANA could belong ICHIMON.
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 	#TAKANOHANA_RESIGN 14		After the board , few members of directors did press conference .	There , OGURUMA lied .	OGURUMA explained the Cabinet Office taught how to use thr Grant Money . This was the reason to make the rule , every OYAKATA had to belong to ICHIMON .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 	#TAKANOHANA_RESIGN 13		Today , apprentices moved to CHIGANOURA-HEYA . Some of the apprentices were crying . Because of emotion of farewell and chagrin . 	They were grown as respectable RIKISHI by TAKANOHANA . And TAKANOHANA-HEYA was their home . Must felt lonely .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 	#TAKANOHANA_RESIGN 12		CHIGANOURA belonged TAKANOHANA-HEYA before , and woked for TAKANOHANA. So , relationship between CHIGANOURA and TAKANOHANA is good. Seems like help each other.	That's why TAKANOHANA wanted CHIGANOURA to commit the apprentices for CHIGANOURA.
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 	#TAKANOHANA_RESIGN 11		Yesterday , 1st October , NSK held extra board of directors .	There NSK approved TAKANOHANA's resignation , and also approved his apprentices trnsfer .	All the apprentices transfer to CHIGANOURA-HEYA , as TAKANOHANA wish .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 	#TAKANOHANA_RESIGN 10		For example , this time , the board of directors decided new rule on this July , every OYAKATA must belong to ICHIMON .	It was not announced for public or was not made document .	It was told on this September for TAKANOHANA .	No governance .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 	#TAKANOHANA_RESIGN ９		In TAKANOHANA's accusation , written about there was not exist governance for NSK .	As I wrote before , NSK is Public Utility Foundation . If there are functionless governance , NSK have to lose qualifier as Public Utility Fundation .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 	#TAKANOHANA_RESIGN ８		For TAKANOHANA , there left only one choice .		ＲＥＳＩＧＮＡＴＩＯＮ		Accept what written in the document means his apprentice , no , for him , his child TAKANOIWA had been almost killed was not crime , and NSK did not try to conseal .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 	#TAKANOHANA_RESIGN ７		If TAKANOHANA would not be able to belong to ICHIMON , that meant he would lose qualifier as OYAKATA . Also TAKANOHANA HEYA would be blown out .	TAKANOHANA was put into severe situation .	Apprentices then on a crisis of discontinuance .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 	#TAKANOHANA_RESIGN ６		On this month , there held SUMO matches called ❛AKI-BASHO❜.	During the competition , TAKANOHANA was told NSK's new rule and if he would not accept about what was written on KASUGANO's document , he will not be able to belong to ICHIMON .
@charliekogure Nurse .		❝Ladies on DOHYOU , get out there , please❞	During life -saving measures .		Female Mayor was at Takarazuka city .
@charliekogure Yes .	And also known as KASUGANO was  in charge of the event held at Maizuru city this April . Which was known as ❛Maizuru incident❜.	Do you remember ？
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 	#TAKANOHANA_RESIGN ５		On August , KASUGANO gave a document to TAKANOHANA .	On this document , written　TAKANOHANA must accept his accusation for the Cabinet Office was fake . NSK did not try to conseal HARUMAFUJI's crime .	It's unacceptable .		PHOTO：KASUGANO https://t.co/sRpJq9dGJj
@BOICEJAPAN515 はい、ご無沙汰致しておりました。		何があったか、いずれ語るかも？		今は、貴乃花親方の御決断に悲しい思いと、日本相撲協会に対する怒りとに包まれております。		世界中の皆様に、この話を共有して頂きたく、戻ってまいりました。		また、宜しくお願い申し上げます。
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 	#TAKANOHANA_RESIGN ４		On July , there held RIJIKAI , which mean board of directors . At this board NSK made a new rule .	Every OYAKATA must belong to ICHIMON .	ICHIMON is a group of OYAKATA of the same faction.	This new rule was not told to TAKANOHANA officially.
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 	#TAKANOHANA_RESIGN ３		TAKANOHANA was penalized other reason . He appeared a TV program and talked what was happened with TAKANOIWA , without NSK's permision .	He became OYAKATA without title . It means he had to work like as a private .	Terrible treatment .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 	#TAKANOHANA_RESIGN ２		TAKANOHANA was penalized for  rank down . TAKANOHANA accused  NSK for the Cabinet Office .	This accusation had to withdrawn .	One of his apprentice beated another apprentice at public place . 	TAKANOHANA also penalized by this incident .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 	#TAKANOHANA_RESIGN １	Why did TAKANOHANA resign his job ？	Because there NSK ploted conspiracy .	As I wrote before , YOKOZUNA HARUMAFUJI injured TAKANOIWA , because TAKANOIWA was non-cooperative for set-up matches .		PHOTO	Left：HARUMAFUJI	right：TAKANOIWA https://t.co/KD0ZzXLRlm
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 	ＴＨＥ　ＲＥＴＵＲＮ		Today , in Japan , there was a shocking news run through all over the Country .	TAKANOHANA , the most famous and beloved former the greatest YOKOZUNA , now OYAKATA resigned his job .	NSK , Nihon Sumo Kyoukai made him hunt down to resignation.

#SUMO_DARKSIDE		SPECIAL 100		The purpose of collecting signatures was remove the public utility certification. That movement was continuing only a month.	Collected 17,000 signitures.	Signatures were submitted for the Cabinet Office on 23rd May.	I hope it will work to correct NSK.
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 99		Because NSK showed DARKSIDE and not to pay tax enough , many Japanese people got angry with this organization .	Especially Maizuru case made ladies angry . It seemed like discrimination against ladies .	Began collecting signatures on 20th  	April .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 98		As I wrote before , NSK is the Public Utility Foundayion . There is preferential tax treatment . NSK paid only 150 thousand yen as tax a year .	SUMO is one of the most favorite show for Japanese . It means make money very easily .	Profit , billions .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 97		Scandals, I introduced were severe problems for NSK. As a matter of course , sincere response were required. But , leaders of NSK , especially the Chief Executive HAKKAKU did not response well.	He seemed like irresposiblity. Not to look like a leader.
本日、大きな地震がありました。		関西地区の皆様、眠れぬ夜をお迎えの事と存じますが、皆様の安心、安全を祈念致します。		心よりの御見舞を申し上げます。
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 96		Every GYOUJI belong to HEYA .	This case , the older GYOUJI is belonging to ‘MIYAGINO-HEYA’ .	Same HEYA with ‘YOKOZUNA HAKUHOU’ .	Peoples who are related HAKUHOU not to dispose for heavier penarties by NSK .	This case , older GYOUJI is suspended .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 95		This case was not announced by NSK for a month since case was occured.	It seemed like NSK was trying to conceal this case.	The younger GYOUJI did not sue the older GYOUJI.	It seemed like NSK was trying control younger GYOUJI with power. Harassment.
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 94		After press covered this case , older GYOUJI talked “I am not a pederast”. What he said looked like homosexual was bad thing .	The essence of this case was forced obscenity for minors . The younger GYOUJI was still underage . I think it was a crime .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 93		The matter of this case was not man kissed a man . SUMO world is a closed society , that's why younger GYOUJI was not able to resist or to reject older GYOUJI was trying to kiss him .	If younger one was trying to resist , he could be lost his job .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 92		Here is another case .	The case of sexual harassment .	After drunk , younger ‘GYOUJI’ , judge , took older GYOUJI to the hotel where they were staying .	As soon as enter the room , older one kissed younger one , and also touched breast . Man and man .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 91		Other incidents .	・Also SHIBATAYAMA_HEYA .	　Senior apprentice beated junior  	　apprentice hard , and junior 	　apprentice went almost blind .	・MINESAKI_HEYA .	　Also senior beated junior .	　Junior apprentice retired because 	　of the violence .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 90		Introducing RIKISHI's ‘MAGE’.		PHOTOS BELOW	①RIKISHI's head.	②Untied RIKISHI's hair.	　When RIKISHI made MAGE , 　　　　	　harden in oil called 	　‘BINTUKE_ABURA’.	③Hair stylist ‘TOKOYAMA’ is	　making MAGE.	④Retirement ceremony	　 ‘DANPATUSHIKI’. https://t.co/VtfPKykmCZ
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 89		Other incidents occured to NSK .	・SHIBATAYAMA A.K.A “SWEETS OYAKATA” beated his apprentice everyday , and selfishly cut apprentices ‘MAGE’ .	MAGE is the hairstyle proof of active RIKISHI . Only when RIKISHI retires , MAGE will be allowed to cut .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 88		There were so many incidents occured to NSK.	・KASUGANO beated his apprentice with golf club.	・One of TOKITUKAZE's apprentice killed by lynch , and TOKITUKAZE tried to hide.	・SEKITORI OOSUNA_ARASHI drove a car without license , and occured accident.
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 87		There were no leaders of NSK took responsibilities for every incidents  facing , besides TAKANOHANA.		When TAKANOIWA was almost killed , one of the suspects HARUMAFUJI retired , but not got penarties.	TAKANOHANA got penarties with 	mysterious reasons.
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 86		Japanese public opinion .	If there were TAKANOHANA , response was appropriate .	There was not the announcement which seemed like discrimination against ladies .		Anyway , who took the responsibilities about Maizuru incident ？	No one . Even KASUGANO .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 85		Rated this poor response , the chief executive HAKKAKU had to apologize to the public .		Ex JYUNGYOU-BUCHOU was TAKANOHANA . But , HAKKAKU took his duty away . That's why TAKANOHANA was not accompanied to Maizuru city .	It made circumstances worse .
@kamesengogo There were problems with this circumstances.	For example, YOKOZUNA HAKUHOU was taken a photo when he was flirting ladies in casual look. He is married.	This time, KASUGANO did not complain to HAKUHOU.	HAKUHOU is at normative position for other RIKISHI.	Discriminatively treatment. https://t.co/zkZyfoy3J4
@kamesengogo EXPLANATION of PHOTO		This photo is when KASUGANO visited to the place RIKISHI belonging TAKANOHANA-HEYA were training .	The purose for visiting was to complain about RIKISHI were sneaking in casual look . 	When RIKISHI are going out to somewhere , they have to wear YUKATA . https://t.co/Lh2NlSmgZS
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 84		After the photo was covered , KASUGANO told another lie .	He said , he was together accompanying the strecher to go to the ambulance on .	There was another person' s testimony , there was not KASUGANO around the ambulance .	Another terrible lying .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 83		According to the testimony by the person who took the photo , the person wondered why KASUGANO did not do anything. The situation was really tensely. And KASUGANO was in charge of the event there.	KASUGANO stood there till  emergency service arrival.
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 82		Explanation of this photo .	The person wearing gray jacket is KASUGANO.	This photo was taken just the time of the announcement said “Ladies on DO_HYOU must get out there , please ”.	This photo proved lies told by KASUGANO.	Also proved he did nothing. https://t.co/hkmlMIeGy3
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 81		What did KASUGANO tell about the incident of Maizuru city to the public ？	First KASUGANO told he was not recognized what was going on , bucause he was at men's room .	Soon after the incident reported on TV , one photo was also covered .	This is it . https://t.co/01ufJDjgKX
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 80		But , the case of Maizuru city , it was the case put a superstition more than human's life itself .	And one more huge problem .	Bad correspondence for the ex post . Repeated false explanation .	‘JYUNGYOU-BUCHOU’ KASUGANO kept telling lies to public .
SUMO_DARKSIDE		SPECIAL 79		The Goddess' anger leads to the crop failure .	That is the reason why ladies are not allowed to step into DO_HYOU .	Maybe , it looks like superstition .	But , every religion have own superstition , I believe .	No superstition should be denied .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 78		Why are ladies not allowed to step into ‘DO_HYOU’ ？	DO_HYOU is a sacred place . The Goddess of good harvest is enshrined .	Because the Goddess is enshrined , if a lady step on DO_HYOU , then the Goddess will get angry due to jealousy . That is said .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 77		Anyway , SUMO stands on ideology of ‘SINTOU’.	This is why the incident of Maizuru city happened .	Many of Japanese peoples believe on the doctrine of ‘SHINTOU’ , ladies are dirty existence , because of their period . Other word to say defilement .

#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 76		Story of IZANAGINO-MIKOTO and IZANAMINO-MIKOTO is similar to the story of “Orpheus and Eurydice”	IZANAGI grieved his wife dead , and went to the land of shadows. At there he met his wife again , and tried to take her back and failed.	Weird similarity.
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 75		For example , there was the Goddess named ‘AMATERASU-OOMIKAMI’(天照大御神) , who was the Goddess of the sun . The Goddess had a role to keep this world bright .	Once she hid the cave and sealed the entrance with big rock . The world became dark .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 74		According ‘KOJIKI’ the God named IZANAGINO-MIKOTO(伊邪那岐命) and the Goddess IZANAMINO-MIKOTO(伊邪那美命) made Japan .	The God and the Goddess were married . Every children of them were the Gods or the Goddesses .	Everyone had own roles or duties .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 73		I wanted to introduce about ‘SINTOU’'s doctrine or religeous text.	But , there are not Holy book like Bible or Quran.	Even there are not clear doctrine .	Only mythologies.	I will introduce a mythology titled ‘KOJIKI’(古事記) , one of the oldest book.
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 72		For pray peace of soul , the monk reads buddhist sutras.		These are the meanings what I wrote “born at shrine , die at temple”	These are habitudes of Japanese people.		By the way , when we marry , we go to shrine or church. Very few wedding at temple.
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 71		We , Japanese peoples are born at shrine , die at temple .	Soon after born , Japanese babies go to shrine and parents pray their baby's health and safe .	Soon after death , Japanese peoples go to the funeral parlor . At there , monk come to pray .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 70		SUMO is not only a sport .	When SUMO events are held , there are also held religious ceremonies .	(Photo below is a scene of the religious ceremony )	Most of the Japanese people believe two religion .	One is Buddhism . Temple	One is ‘SHINTOU’ . Shrine https://t.co/IBWNSF6VzY
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 69		https://t.co/5JemBIx0qi @youtube		On this video , announcements said 	“Ladies on DO_HYOU must get out from there , please ” .		Basically no ladies are allowed to step into DO_HYOU , under ordinary circumstances. 	But , this situation it was emergency.
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 68		Mr. Tatami was fell down because of subarachnoid hemorrhage . His life was in danger . Needed emergency medical benefits .	Medical nurses were at the gymnasium for watching the event .	They run to help the Mayor .		https://t.co/5JemBIx0qi @youtube
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 67		On 4th April this year , at MAIZURU city nothern KYOTO , there was “JYUNGYOU” held .	At the gymnasium where JYUNGYOU held , before the event , Ryouzou Tatami , the Mayor of Maizuru city , greeted to the audiences .	During the greetings he fell down .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 66		This tour is so called “JYUNGYOU” .	The purpose of “JYUNGYOU” is popuralization of SUMO .	More than half a Century ago , there were lots of peoples who did not have opportunity to spectate SUMO . For the peoples NSK was started to tour arround JAPAN .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 65		Before his disposition , TAKANOHANA was working as 	“JYUNGYOU-BUCHO” （巡業部長）	There are 6 BASHO , meaning official matches , held in a year .	Between BASHO to next BASHO , there are almost two months break . NSK has tour during in this period .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 64		TAKANOHANA is now only TOSHIYORI . Has no authorities or important duties at work .	It's not right treatment for ICHIDAI-TOSHIYORI TAKANOHANA .	This is why Japanese persons who really love SUMO get angry with NSK and HAKKAKU , who is not responsible .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 63		Not enough supervised for TAKAYOSHITOSHI ？	What did it mean ？	Of course , TAKAYOSHITOSHI beated TAKASEIRYU . But there were lots of similar violences had happened .	I've never heard other OYAKATA got heavy dispositions like TAKANOHANA by violence .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 62		Reason of disposition were 	VIOLATION of dedicated work duties and 	not enough SUPERVISED his apprentice TAKAYOSHITOSHI .		I still don't understand these reasons of disposition .		I believe there were no work duties for TAKANOHANA during HARUBASHO .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 61		After TOSHIYORI SOUKAI , HAKKAKU announced the dispositions for TAKANOHANA and TAKAYOSHITOSHI .	TAKANOHANA        2 ranks down .	TAKAYOSHITOSHI  Suspended for NATUBASHO		TAKANOHANA was made his rank 5 levels down since 4th January , this year .
One week vacation ！		In Japan 29th April to 6th May , there were so called “Golden-week” , which means public holday week .		Yes , I also enjoyed the week 💖		How did I spent the week ？		Sorry , there was nothing special to tell you about .

#SUMO_DARKSIDE		Εγώ tweeting για SUMO στα Αγγλικά.	SUMO είναι γνωστή ως ιαπωνική παραδοσιακή τέχνη της πάλης.	Αυτές τις μέρες Γύρω από το ατμόσφαιρα SUMO να πάρει χειρότερα και χειρότερα.	Συνωμοσία, Απόκρυψη, βία, Mobs, κλπ.	Θα εισαγάγει αυτά τα σοβαρά προβλήματα.
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		Eu sunt tweeting despre SUMO în limba engleză.	SUMO este cunoscut sub numele de artă tradiţională japoneză de luptă.	Aceste zile atmosfera surround SUMO se înrăutăţeşte şi mai rău.	Conspiratie, Tăinuirea, violenţă, mafioti, etc.	Voi introduce aceste probleme grav.
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		Я впевнений, tweeting про СУМО англійською мовою.	СУМО відомий як японського традиційного мистецтва, боротьби.	Ці дні об'ємного звуку атмосферою СУМО стають все гірше й гірше.	Змова, Απόκρυψη, насильства, моби та ін.	Я буду представляти ці серйозні проблеми.
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 60		That TOSHIYORI SOUKAI was the lynch concocted by HAKKAKU , denoted not to be allowed to resist HAKKAKU .	What should I call this？	Show off the power？	Reign of terror？	Dictatorship？		For me , what HAKKAKU did for TAKANAHANA was overkill or outrage.
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 59		For live through the SUMO world TAKANOHANA apologized to the others .	Other OYAKATA ranted for TAKANOHANA with seeking dissmisal TAKANOHANA .	I still don't understand why they seeked dissmisal . Did TAKANOHANA do something wrong to the others ？ No ！
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 58		Can you imagine the scene , 100 person blame only 1person violently spectacle ？	It must be the inferno for the person blamed .	I believe TAKANOHANA did nothing wrong . No need to apologize . But , apology must only the way to live through SUMO world.
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 57		Rant at the person , who continue to apologize , is not sense of Japanese people. I believe there is a lot of difference from Japanese common sense.	I think that time TAKANOHANA might have lost words besides words of apology in the situation of there.
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 56		TAKANOHANA requested recess . He needed the time to think what and how to answer the questions .	After recess over , TAKANOHANA started to apologize for everyone .	Some of OYAKATA ranted and raved with saying “You don't answer the questions we asked”.
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 55		And also leaders of NSK prepaired the document which written what questions should to ask for TAKANOHANA .	After watched the show , TAKANOHANA was called to the room filled full of air rage .	Some of OYAKATA asked questions as written , with anger .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 54		Some of the OYAKATA were in a rage  , because of watched the show. They might thought TAKANOHANA was too much selfish and had to be trying to disturb NSK.	Leaders of NSK explained the show was taken without permission before made them watch the show.
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 53		On 28th March , TOSHIYORI-SOUKAI 	had held . Priorly SOUKAI held , NSK showed for every OYAKATA except TAKANOHANA , VTR of the TV show  which TAKANOHANA appeared and talked about HARUMAFUJI's incident . Most of the OYAKATA did not watch it before .

#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 52		After TAKAYOSHITOSHI's violent incident happened , situation had changed bigly .	TAKANOHANA was not able to absent any more .	And bigger change .	TAKANOHANA withdrawed the indictment from the Cabinet office.	It was symbolized end of fight against NSK.
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 51		It's still difficult to understand NSK did not give permission for TAKANOHANA to absent HARUBASHO .	TAKANOIWA appeared HARUBASHO with under circumstance suffered from after-effects .	Because of rank down , TAKANOHANA did not have important duties .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 50		Reason why TAKANOHANA requested to absent HARUBASHO was condition of TAKANOIWA .	TAKANOIWA was heavily injured .	TAKANOHANA concerned about after-effects of TAKANOIWA's injuries . TAKANOIWA still suffered from pain by skull base fracture .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 49		During HARUBASHO had held , TAKANOHANA was condemned his behavior by NSK .	NSK claimed TAKANOHANA was absence without permission .	This was a terrible lie .	TAKANOHANA sent absent request by fax . NSK did not permit .	Unreasonable not to permit .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		SPECIAL 31		Now TAKANOHANA has to work under younger TOSHIYORI . This duty is the biggest insult for TAKANOHANA .	Please imagine this . Person director class work under mere employee , who doesn't know about jobs and duties enough .	Can you put up with that ？
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 48		NSK earn billions yen as business income every year .		As our common sense , a convict should not work for ‘PUBLIC’ organization .	As a tax payer , as a SUMO fan , in both posision , I don't allow HARUMAFUJI work for NSK any more . Of course ！
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 47		NSK had not been responsible as the public utility foundation .		These contents were not false .		For example , HARUMAFUJI who almost killed TAKANOIWA came back SUMO world as coach .		NSK have recieved tax benefits .	NSK paid only 150K yen as tax .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 46		Because TAKANOHANA submitted the indictment for the Cabinet office , he seemed like to look for a fight against NSK .	But , the indictment was included 		NSK gave improper disposal for TAKANOHANA .		NSK lost governance .		HAKKAKU privatized NSK .

#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 44		Appearing TV show made another cause of stir for TAKANOHANA .	NSK claimed portrait rights infringement for broadcasted ‘TV ASAHI’ . And also claimed for TAKANOHANA without permission appearrance .	This would be one reason to blame for TAKANOHANA .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 43		My opinion , if HAKKAKU was asked same question as TAKANOHANA , what would he answered ？I believe HAKKAKKU answered “the great existence”	Because , he thinks about himself the great existence . For me , HAKKAKKU looks like so .	Cheap , I feel .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 42		Japanese word 		‘HOUYOURYOKU’ (包容力)		including several meanings . Not only means ‘capacity’ .	Contain , envelop , forgive , permissive , etc.	Anyway , what TAKANOHANA said expressed his hugeness or greatness.	I felt like watching 	“the God of SUMO”
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 41		After watched the show , I was impressed very much by what TAKANOHANA said .	For me , most impressed words were “YOKOZUNA means CAPACITY”	This was the answer , he asked by interviewer “for you , what does YOKOZUNA mean？”	Actually he said HOUYOURYOKU.

#SUMO_DARKSIDE		I am tweeting about SUMO in English .	SUMO is known as Japanese traditional art of fighting .	These days atmosphere surround SUMO are getting worse and worse .	Conspiracy , Cosealment , Violence , Mobs , etc. 	I will introduce these severely problems .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 40		After the RIJI election , which TAKANOHANA was not reelected , TAKANOHANA appeared on TV , and talked about everything he knew and how he felt about the incident . This was an interview format program .	He talked very clearly , polite explanation .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		SPECIAL 39		If documents are not meaning “report” for NSK , then what will be meaning report for NSK .	For me it seems like bully for the person who did not cooperate conseal the crime .		After that penalty , HAKKAKU's conspiracy to cotinue on .	Definitely evil .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		SPECIAL 38		NSK was to follow in HAKKAKU's decision , gave TAKANOHANA a penalty , which made his rank down .	The reason was violated reporting duty .	I still don't understand what NSK was saying .	TAKANOHANA reported with documents . It meant to fulfill his duty .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		SPECIAL 37		TAKANOHANA reported about 20 times for NSK. Contents were police was on investigation , and till investigation ended he was not able to talk about the incident for NSK.	NSK did not allow this as report.	TAKANOHANA also wrote he would talk everything.
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		SPECIAL 36		Also as I tweeted before , TAKANOHANA has been thinking apprentices are his children .	If your child are injured by someone , what will you do ？	I want to beat the person who is injured my child .	TAKANOHANA kept cool .	I cannot be imitated him .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		SPECIAL 35		After the incident , TAKANOHANA reported to the police and accused HARUMAFUJI .	HAKKAKU wanted to conseal this incident . And , wanted to report NSK first .	There was a possibility to death became TAKANOIWA .	Police first was a deed true to the law .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		SPECIAL 34		I don't beieve no one there had morality or qualification .		But , why did TAKANOHANA has to apologize for other OYAKATA ？		Here is a story . 		As I tweeted before , last October HARUMAFUJI almost killed TAKANOHANA's apprentice TAKANOIWA .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		SPECIAL 33		TAKANOHANA had to apologized for every other OYAKATA .	Other OYKATA had a fit of rage and ranted , raved to TAKANOHANA . With saying lacked of description .		Really？		Did they really have morality or qualification to rant or rave for TAKANOHANA ？
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		SPECIAL 32		Same day TOSHIYORI SOUKAI , general meeting held .	This meeting was irregular , and ordinary not every TOSHIYORI had to join the meeting .	That day every TOSHIYORI joined the meeting , and every OYAKATA blamed TAKANOHANA.	Inferno for TAKANOHANA there .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		SPECIAL 30		After HARUBASHO closed HAKKAKU reelected for RIJICHO without election .	28th March , HAKKAKU announced 	TAKANOHANA's new duties . TAKANOHANA for SHINPAN , a judge .	Ordinary , judge is served by younger TOSHIYORI , who doesn't have enough experiences .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		SPECIAL 29		Because TAKANOHANA did not reelect , his rank down again . 	Then , he became only IIN , comittee .	This was not the penalty , but legitimacy was suspected .	I've never heard defeated the election meant rank down in the  organization . Impossible way .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 28		Was there a necessity of change back the voting system for NSK ？		Yes , there was .		Hakkaku did not want TAKANOHANA to be elected for RIJI , again .	Changed back meant blocking .		This tactics hitted the core .	TAKANOHANA did not reelect .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 27		Write down candidate's name means make easier to find traitor .		After the Cabinet office indicated voters write circle on the candidate's name .		The election on February , NSK made the voting system back to the former system . Against the guidence .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		SPECIAL 26		Cabinet office hate this traditional rule , and indicated a guidance free vote .	NSK once changed voting system .	Brfore system changed , write down candidate's name . Under this system , others could know who vote whom , because of handwriting .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		SPECIAL 25		On 2nd February , RIJI election was held.	This election had problems.	There are 101 TOSHIYORI are enrolled NSK. All TOSHIYORI belong to ICHIMON , which means like family circle. There is a basicaly rule , no TOSHIYORI can vote other ICHIMON's TOSHIYORI
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 24		Where in the world like this way to go unchallenged ？	Person related victim is punished and criminal is not punished .	What kind of organization NSK is .	What is committee of council ？	What kind of persons former attorney and former councillor ？
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 23		By the way , did assailant HARUMAFUJI get a penalty ？	No , he did not .	How come he did not get a penalty ？	Because he resigned himself , that's why NSK did not give him more penalty . But , he has a criminal record , now . Is it fair or impartial？
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 22		Here I introduce rank of penalty of NSK . Upside heavier penalty .		Disciplinary dismissal	Retirement advice	Rank down	Out of duties	Suspended	Reduction of compensation	Censure		TAKANOHANA got the third heaviest penalty . It was definitely wrong .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 21		NSK gave penalty for TAKANOHANA was not justified , and not reasonable . It meant to tell for the public , NSK rules override the law , and NSK punished victim side .		Was there a JUSTICE ？		Anyway , TAKANOHANA became only YAKUIN-TAIGU-IIN .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		SPECIAL 20		According TAKANOHANA's testimony , he reported almost 20 times for NSK .	Also TAKANOHANA requested for NSK  to wait him .	He said that still police was on investigation .	After investigation had done , TAKANOHANA would report himself to NSK .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		SPECIAL 19		The committee of council had same ideas with HAKKAKU .	Former attorney TOSHIO TAKANO and former councilor of the Diet YASUKO IKENOBOU trusted what HAKKAKU said . They did not give the opportunity of explanation for TAKANOHANA , and decided penalty .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		SPECIAL 18		Involved the crime , that was the reason TAKANOHANA reported to the police first .	This simple logic has been against the way of NSK's thoughts . That was the reason , HAKKAKU requested for committee of council to TAKAKANOHANA's rank down .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		SPECIAL 17		This must be the constitution of NSK's concealment . The facts , which are incovenient , must conceal . That was the reason NSK ordered TAKANOHANA to report first .	It seams NSK stands over the law .		TAKANOHANA thought his apprentice involved crime .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		SPECIAL 16		I suspect NSK tryed conceal the incident . If TAKANOHANA did not report to the police about his apprentice injury , NSK could make the situation there was not lynch for TAKANOIWA and no media would report the assault case . wanted to handle privately .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 15		TAKANOHANA was RIJI until this January . On 4th Jan. committee of council was held . There NSK proposed TAKANOHANA's rank down . Reason was HARUMAFUJI incident.	NSK ordered TAKANOHANA to report about the incident. NSK wanted not to report for police.
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		SPECIAL 14		Here I introduce rank of OYAKATA .		RIJICHOU：Chief Executive	RIJI：Director	FUKU-RIJI：Deputy Director	YAKUIN-TAIGU-IIN：Directors Treatment	IIN：Committee	SHUNIN：Corporal	TOSIYORI：originally elderly person	                     without title OYAKATA
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 13		On 25th March , HARUBASHO was closed . Next day , HAKKAKU was reelected as the Chief Executive of NSK , and made TAKANOHANA's rank down , as I wrote before .	It was unfair human resource .	Because there was no legitimate reasons . It was a raw deal .
@PReedGolf		Congratulations for your the first 	MAJOR TITLES WINNING ！		Hope your much more prosper .		with best wishes .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		SPECIAL 12		NSK announced TAKAYOSHITOSHI's  incident for media .	Master TAKANOHANA needed to apologize about his apprentice.	TAKANOHANA is a kind of a person , who thinks apprentices are his children. Bad occasion , he assumes full responsibility for apprentices.
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		SPECIAL 11		Someone told about this for leaders of NSK . Soon , Chief Executive HAKKAKU called TAKAYOSHITOSHI  and examined about his assault .	TAKAYOSHITOSHI answered , assault was fact .	NSK treated about this a huge incident .	TAKAYOSHITOSHI had to absent .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		SPECIAL 10		After TAKAYOSHITOSHI came back ‘SHITAKUBEYA’ , dressing room , he complained to TAKASEIRYU . TAKASEIRYU excused . I don't know what TAKASEIRYU said correctly .	Anyhow TAKAYOSHITOSHI got angry with TAKASEIRYU and beated , everyone there looked it at .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		SPECIAL 9		RIKISHI are not allowed to delay their ‘TORIKUMI’ , means match .	That day , TAKAYOSHITOSHI approach to DO_HYOU , SAKAIGAWA who is in charge of advance matches , stopped TAKAYOSHITOSHI and bellowed him in the cruel words .	TAKAYOSHITOSHI lost that day.
@UrgeF @atsushi752000GT @policy_freedom @komichi2 I as a Japanese citizen , always long noble . Want not to forget dignity .	I want to believe others must be same as me .	Off course , I am trying not forget mind of OMOTENASHI .	Unfortunately , there are animals wareing people's skin , belonging SUMO WORLD . Opposite . Feel bad .

#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 8		On 11th March , HARUBASHO opened  at Osaka .	On 18th , one of TAKANOHANA's apprentice TAKAYOSHITOSHI beated other apprentice TAKASEIRYU .	TAKASEIRYU was TUKEBITO for TAKAYOSHITOSHI .	TUKEBITO has a role let come into play . That day TAKASEIRYU delayed.
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 7		There were bad conditions for TAKANOHANA .	He accused for the Cabinet Office of Japan , is having jurisdiction over  NSK , about after HARUMAFUJI's incident , NSK lost governance and HAKKAKU ran out on rules too far .	For me , NSK seems illegal state .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 6		On such a long history , there were only 3 OYAKATA allowed ICHIDAI OYAKATA .	Other expression , TAKANOHANA has to be respected .	What HAKKAKU did was based opposite idea .	HAKKAKU should not make TAKANOHANA's  rank down .	I took it for granted I claim.
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL 5		On the rank the Chief Executive is the highest position of NSK .	But , de facto , TAKANOHANA is the highest existence of NSK .	My opinion , TAKANOHANA must be an untachable .	History of SUMO can date since mythical era . History of NSK began 1925 .
@CbkraWj1mmyuNLa Sorry for interrupt you , but , there is not Seattle state . Seattle , Washington .

RT @travelnthruEU: Hi @AkijiKurosawa  Thanks for the follow. Your page is really interesting &amp; a good read. Keep on tweeting. Enjoy your da…
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		SPECIAL 4		Achievement , that is a key word to describe how TAKANOHANA is great .	He left great results , contributed to the SUMO WORLD's development , and evaluated his personality great .　	That was why he became ICHIDAI OYAKATA .	His existence is outstanding .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		SPECIAL 3		Those 3 OYAKATA are called “ICHIDAI OYAKATA” (一代親方 one generation OYAKATA) .	Ordinary , OYAKATA names are consistently reused .	ICHIDAI OYAKATA are in praise of achievement to use active names .	No one will be able to use ICHIDAI OYAKATA names .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		SPECIAL 2		RIKISHI are using “SHIKONA” (四股名 ring names) , when they are active . After retirement some of RIKISHI become  “OYAKATA” (親方 SUMO master) .	OYAKATA are not using same name as thier SHIKONA .	There are only 3 OYAKATA allowed to use thier SHIKONA .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		SPECIAL		Almost a week , I did not tweet anything . I want to explain what has happened to me .		Last Monday , there was an election of chief executive of NSK .	There HAKKAKU was reelected as chief again .	After the election HAKKAKU made TAKANOHANA's rank down .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		48		Because denied set up matches , TAKANOIWA was beaten by HARUMAFUJI .	Is accept set up match , a justice ？	Is beating someone till almost dead , a justice .	Yes for HARUMAFUJI , looks like .		This incredible thought exist in NSK , too .	NSK tried to conceal .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		47		If there were not coverage the incident by press , what HARUMAFUJI would do ？	HARUMAFUJI seemed like there was not a crime , he seemed like done justice .		But , what was justice ？		Biginning was HAKUHOU ordered TAKANOIWA to accept the set up matches .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		46		TAKANOIWA was not able to fight at ‘KYUSHU BASHO’ . Because of his head injuries , he was absence whole ‘BASHO’ .	First , assailant HARUMAFUJI appeared ‘BASHO’ . But , after the press coverage , HARUMAFUJI had to be absence . Till then , he behaved normaly .
@JeremyBlaustein いいでしょ。日本語で。	そちらもfake follower はいますよ。	これ以上、時間裂きたくないので	これで終わります。	fake sumo fan さん
@JeremyBlaustein As a Japanese citizen , what NSK and HAKUHOU are doing 	UNACCEPTABLE .	I love my country , that's my motivation .	Are you really sumo fan ？	I have been watching sumo 50 years . And I assert NSK now is really terrible .
@JeremyBlaustein Do you have problems to answer my question ？	Another question , here . 	To whom do you work for ？	What you were saying seemed like you wanted to help evils .
@JeremyBlaustein Please tell me , whom you pointed to say 偽善者？
@JeremyBlaustein You were watching a news report .	That time , no media told fact correctly . Some reporters were to try to handle the public impressions 	TAKANOHANA was evil .	Have you heard the Japanese word “SONTAKU” (忖度)？	Media stood NSK's side and attacked vitim's side .	That is problem .
@JeremyBlaustein According TAKANOHANA's testimony , police told him no necessity to report to NSK , police would do .	Maybe , I had to wright so .	Anyway Japanese police don't like victims and assailants to talk directly . Basically .		I am wodering you have curiosity this case .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		45		In the announced certificate , there were written , there were no obstacles to fight .	NSK explained TAKANOIWA was in able to fight condition .	Some expert talked TAKANOIWA's condition was just one step before death , after the fact became known .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		44		I don't know who indicated to tamper the contents , and also I don't know the doctor who wrote the certificate .	In original certificate , there were written if there were no obstacles , TAKANOIWA could fight . But the announced certificate were different.
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		43		Here are contents of medical certificate announced by NSK .		CONCUSSION		ANTERIOR LEFT HEAD LACERATION		RIGHT EAR OTITIS EXTERNA		RIGHT SKULL BASE FRACTURE		CEREBROSPINAL FLUID LEAK		need to heal 2 weeks .		This certificate was included the facts .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		42		On 14th last november , sports newspaper named “SPORTS NIPPON” coveraged about HARUMAFUJI's incident .	One day before , NSK published TAKANOIWA's medical certificate .	This announcement was doubtful contents .	Today , everybody believe this was falsification.
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		41		There are 6 ‘BASHO’ in a year .	Here is schedule .		month  place　　 called 	JAN. 　Tokyo 　   HATSU-BASHO	MAR.　Osaka　   HARU-BASHO	MAY  　Tokyo　　NATSU-BASHO	JUL. 　Nagoya　  NAGOYA-BASHO	SEPT.　Tokyo　　AKI-BASHO	NOV. 　Fukuoka　KYUSHU-BASHO
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		40		Till JYURYOU , RIKISHI cannot receive salary . They are treared as “RIKISHI YOUSEI-IN” , means trainee . They get allowance every ‘BASHO’ , 70~150 thausand yen . 		They have place to live , are fed by ‘HEYA’ , that's why they don't need money , so much .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		39		Till RIKISHI rising up their rank as JYURYOU , they fight only 7 days in one “BASHO”.	They have to care their HEYA's SEKITORI. That's why they are also called “TUKEBITO”(付け人) 		TUKEBITO must do every chores , like cooking , laundry , cleaning bathing , etc.

#SUMO_DARKSIDE		34		NSK has their own rules .	If something had happened , members must report to NSK first .	But this case was a criminal . Truistic which took precedence , LAW or RULE .	Leaders were not understand this simple legal theory . 	I believe still they don't understand
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		33		Police might think this incident was really serious .	Depending on the perspective , it was 		probably an attempt murder case		probably lynch		Anyway , it was not simple assault case .	And also police hates victims to talk  about incident with others .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		32		TAKANOHANA went to the police at  29th last October .	Police got in touch with NSK at 1st last November .	Leaders of NSK would seem to be surprised . Soon they tried to contacted TAKANOHANA and asked him to report .	But police told TAKANOHANA , not to talk .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		31		Photo below is TAKANOIWA's state of head injury , right after the treatment.	As you can see ,  sew up wounds with staples.	When RIKISHI fights , RIKISHI will bump on the head first. That's why if there is heavy injury on the head , there will be difficulties. https://t.co/tMV7BuFvEg

#SUMO_DARKSIDE		28		TAKANOHANA had no hesitations . 	He decided to sue HARUMAFUJI .	TAKANOHANA wanted to know who would report to NIHON SUMO KYOUKAI , because he had a duty to report , TAKANOHANA himself or police would do .	Police answered they would report about incident .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		27		At this moment , TAKANOHANA determined prosecution .	He took TAKANOIWA and headed to the police .		After Officers heard the circumstances , Officers explained to TAKANOHANA , this was a serious affair , and they wanted to know he had a will to law suit or not.

Some specialist commented there is a dread of TAKANOIWA's character will be changed . https://t.co/kyK5xArEA6
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		25		At last TAKANOIWA told what had happened to him .	TAKANOHANA realy surprised , and took his apprentice to the hospital .		Doctor told to TAKANOHANA how severely injured TAKANOIWA was .	His skull was damaged enough , not to be able to fight on DOHYO .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		24		First TAKANOIWA explained to his master , he fell down at the staircase . But , his master was clever enough to detect his apprentice were telling lies . 	Also TAKANOHANA had enough experiences to know what kind of injuries .	TAKANOHANA asked again and again .

#SUMO_DARKSIDE		23		TAKANOIWA's master TAKANOHANA didn't recognize about the incident soon .	Because RIKISHI are always injure through their trainings .	But , TAKANOHANA felt something wrong . He asked what had happened to his apprentice . But , TAKANOIWA didn't tell the truth .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		22		Soon after get out from the Karaoke Club , 3 YOKOZUNA tried to flirt a lady riding on a bycicle. But that flirting was failure.	Then they went to eat Ramen, Japanese famous and often eaten noodle.	Their deed was against the law.	They had first aid obligations.
#SUMO_DARKSIDE 		21		After HAKUHOU stopped HARUMAFUJI , 3 YOKOZUNA , ISIURA , his son and Shinichi Hamazaki , who is a Prefectural Assembly Member of Tottori and was also staying crime scene , went out from the Karaoke Club .	They didn't care about injured 2 RIKISHI .

#SUMO_DARKSIDE		19		One condition more .	All RIKISI are belonging to HEYA , same meaning with ‘ROOM’ in Japanese language .	HEYA is like team . SUMO matches are individual fightings . HEYA is the place for training , for telling to RIKISI what or  how to think Sumo is .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		18		According to the article , TERUNOFUJI had been given sermons by 3 YOKOZUNA about his behavior for training .	My opinion , the article doubtful .	I don't believe 3 YOKOZUNA are not like that persons , who are thinking SUMO so much seriously .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		17		Here's condition about TERUNOFUJI .	Rejection of alcohol , bad knee .		That night , 3 YOKOZUNA made him drink forcedly . And made him sit on floor in SEIZA .	（Picture below is a lady sit in SEIZA）	Sitting in SEIZA gave his knee a bad influence . https://t.co/3NWhdeotcF
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		16		Another story of the night HARUMAFUJI almost killed TAKANOIWA .		As before written , there was also OOZEKI TERUNOFUJI at crime scene . What was he doing there？		He was lynched by 3 YOKOZUNA .		Before telling about the lynch , must tell about TERUNOFUJI .

SUMO_DARKSIDE		15		HAKUHOU stopped HARUMAFUJI at this moment . Till then HAKUHOU was just looking the violence .	I believe HAKUHOU indeedly thought bad situation , if it would be a murder case .	HAKUKOU took TAKANOIWA out of the room . TAKANOIWA survived , but severely injured .
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		14		The picture below is DENMOKU which HARUMAFUJI used to beat TAKANOIWA. DENMOKU is a remote contoroler of karaoke machine.	HARUMAFUJI also used beer bottle to beat TAKANOIWA. 	Last , HARUMAFUJI took an ice pick  and said “I'm gonna kill you ”	He tried to kill. https://t.co/xKsVW0ZXFo
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		13		3 YOKOZUNA wanted cooperate for set up matches to TAKANOIWA . But , TAKANOIWA refuse for set up .	It was the reason of HARUMAFUJI commit outrage .		According to the testimony , first HARUMAFUJI punched TAKANOIWA with his bare hand . Next he hitted with DENMOKU
#SUMO_DARKSIDE		12		Because , his master was ‘GACHINKO RIKISHI’ , TAKANOIWA had to be told , schould not set up the match .		3 YOKOZUNA were living in opposite aideas . Because of set up matches they could be YOKOZUNA .	My opinion their abilities are not good enough for YOKOZUNA

#SUMO,DARKSIDE		If YOKOZUNA can not win the competition , YOKOZUNA is asked his responsibility . That is why HAKUHOU wanted make set up matches .		TAKANOHANA hated set up matches when he was playing .	He fought without set up .	RIKISHI like him is so called ‘GACHINKO RIKISHI’ .
#SUMO,DARKSIDE		HAKUHOU wanted to talk about set up games .	There are 6 conpetitions in a year .	Every conpetition held 15 days .	One day one match for every single SEKITORI , who are higher rank of  SUMO world .	YOKOZUNA is the highest rank , and  that's why yokozuna must win .
#SUMO,DARKSIDE		The crime scene was a KARAOKE BAR , managed by ISHIURA .	Wated 3 YOKOZUNA were 	69th YOKOZUNA HAKUHOU	70th YOKOZUNA HARUMAFUJI	71st YOKOZUNA KAKURYU		There were also 	OOZEKI TERUNOFUJI 	ISIURA and his son , who is also RIKISHI .		HAKUHOU arranged this meeting .

#SUMO,DARKSIDE		TAKANOHANA allowed TAKANOIWA to meet his school master . Also said to give some present for ISIURA and show his appreciation for his school master .		TAKANOIWA arrived at the promised place , there were also three YOKOZUNA waiting TAKANOIWA .Beggining of incident
#SUMO,DARKSIDE		Because his master of school time invited him , TAKANOIWA was not able to refuse invitation .	TAKANOIWA told about invitation for his master TAKANOHANA , who is former YOKOZUNA and one of the best RIKISHI of SUMO history .	TAKANOHANA was 65th YOKOZUNA .
#SUMO,DARKSIDE		I must say  HARUMAFUJI lost respects from his mind . 		The INCIDENT had begun like this .		TAKANOIWA was invited by his school teacher ISHIURA , who is a principle of TOTTORI JYOUHOKU HIGH SCHOOL . ISHIURA taught Sumo for  TAKANOIWA in his school days .
#SUMO,DARKSIDE		RESPECT is a most important element for Rikishi .	Need to respect ‘DO_HYOU’ , what is  Sumo games playing on . 	Need respect for opposite .	Need respect for ‘GYOUJI’ , who is  an umpire .	Need respect for ‘SISHOU’ , the master .	So on and on .	Every others .

#SUMO,DARKSIDE		These decades , there are lots of Rikisi , who don't understand this divineness , playing Sumo world .	Simpley say Rikisi from abroad .	Those Rikisi made Sumo rough .	It is a background of Harumafuji's attempt murder case .	No respect to the others .
#SUMO,DARKSIDE	SUMO is also called “SUMO WRESTLING” in abroad .	I believe there are lots of difference between Sumo and wrestling .	When Sumo is held , there will need to perform rites based Japanese religion ‘SINTOU’ . For us , Japanese  people Sumo is divine .
#SUMO,DARKSIDE	25th , last October , a terrible incident occured at Tottori Pref. Japan .	Victim was SEKITORI TAKANOIWA .	Suspect was YOKOZUNA HARUMAFUJI .	Harumafuji almost killed Takanoiwa . Attempted murder case .	This incident made shaken the world of SUMO .
#SUMO,DARKSIDE		Sumo , which is known as Japanese traditional art of fighting . Now a days , circumstances sorround Sumo are getting worse and worse . 	Incidents , conspiracy , consealment , violence , mobs , there are so many  problems . 	I will introduce these severely problems
