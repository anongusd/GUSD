@LuxAngela I know your strategy. Block the truth tellers if it does not fit your agenda.
@LuxAngela You should be ashamed of yourself. Now you know the truth acknowledg it. So your sorry, if it is in your vocabulary.
@kapboy59 @JEmilyTX @RepDebHaaland Yeah--let us name them all so we can offer an apology. Right Mr. Ott?
@JEmilyTX @RepDebHaaland An apology to the kids from the south is in order. How about it Emily? Evidence is very important.
@RepDebHaaland Now that the truth is out how about an apology to the American people? I doubt it.
@thehill Why did Sanders run for re-election? Don't he say get the hell out of politics?
@AFTunion Won big? Is losing the Senate small?
@hammetjohn This is misleading. She was not on the plane.
@AFTunion @Michelle4NM @AFTNM @rweingarten And we lost two Senate seats. Great job.	Thanks Obama, Buffet, Oprah, etc. I'm with her!
@AFTunion @rweingarten Got to hand it to you AFT--That great big blue wave washed two Senate seats away from the Dems.
@rweingarten Randi-- Why do you stand for everything I detest?
@rweingarten @RichCordray @BettySutton @toledonews Hey Randi--did you throw your support to any Republican?
@rweingarten When exactly did the GOP say this?
@JohnJHarwood @rweingarten Don't believe that shit! Remember HuffPost? Clinton 98.7% chance of beating Trump.
@BetteMidler @Mainepablo Speak for yourself. This poor school teacher has more money in his pocket thanks to the tax cuts. VOTE RED!!!
@yellowredsparks @WitherRocks I know how you are feeling. Happens to me all the time.
@POTUS_Schedule What is the other stuff spread across the stage when the president speaks?
@BernieSanders Such hypocrisy.
@PhilBredesen Yeah-I will vote for you. I do not believe in prosperity.
@GeorgeTakei @BlueWaveVoters No. I am proud to take the red wave.
@RetiredNYCPD @marcmolinaro If only.......
@AeynaLali @AndrewGillum Yes, the truth is always right--that is why Trump is our president.
@csd @AndrewGillum How do I know he's good people? Just take your word for it?
@AndrewGillum What is the truth? Please elaborate.
@AFTunion @AndrewGillum @fedingram @rweingarten @BrowardTeachers @FloridaEA Do you truly believe republicans will shut down public education?
@AFTunion @rweingarten @TheRevAl That does it Randi! An official Jew hater campaigning for the union? I am truly ashamed to be a card carrying teacher. You make me want to stop paying dues! #AFTVotes Red! For our children's sake.
@raymysterio305 @Soulm81 But aren't we talking about mostly women and children who are trying to flee their countries?
@BernieSanders Don't count on them to vote. They might become triggered and panic if they see too many republicans.
@CasyRybeck @wildforcongress @HoarseWisperer Men are 98% guilty of unwanted pregnancies? Do I hear you correctly? What has our nation come to?
@LiberallyHappy @wildforcongress The only alternative? For God's sake sister can't you control yourself? Pitiful.
@wildforcongress @WenWillRun So you can choose to abort at birth? God save you!
@rweingarten Randi what the f are you talking about? You are a loser just like the party you support. Who is really afraid?
@AFTunion @rweingarten Trust me, I am not afraid to vote for you. I choose not to.
@AFTunion @rweingarten Just like the other side was afraid to vote in 2016!
@Can2geterdone @HelloTeamTrump @POTUS Sickening. Thanks for sharing. Speaks volumes. God help us.
@trumpdictionary @realDonaldTrump Just swallow your hate already.
@TwitchyTeam @JessBastardi Did this incident make it to CNN?
@jjilmary Know your history! The president and vice president cannot travel together. You know, not on the same airplane. God!
@PhilMcCrackin44 @hammetjohn @CoryBooker @CNN @maddow Where is the breaking news on @Senbooker? Crickets so far.
@CNNPolitics @cnnbrk @cnnbrk still waiting for @SenBooker breaking news story?
@cnnbrk Where is @SenBooker breaking news story? #Webelieve
@cnnbrk Where is @SenBooker breaking news story? Did I miss it?
@Jodieannkeeton3 @CoryBooker @ebenezer_atl I BELIEVE HIM! Hope you like jail scumbag!
@CoryBooker @ebenezer_atl How dare you! Sexual assault pervert. Step down now!!!!
@NatDi263 @DearAuntCrabby @senatemajldr Repeal and replace record high employment with record high unemployment. Do it now your life depends on it.
@DearAuntCrabby @WenWillRun @senatemajldr You are right! Stop them now and vote for the Socialist Party. Democrats will give us free health care, free college, free borders, free houses, free cars, free air, and a free long stem üåπ. Get out and vote Democrats and all your problems will go away. Simple.
@rweingarten We had a democratic president who gave us the Common Core which infringes on every child and parent privacy rights. Give us a break. Stop the lies!!!
@RBReich @WenWillRun Since Latino unemployment is at a a record low this is indeed very bad news for the Republican Party.
@rweingarten @rweingarten you have been sprewing the same boring dribble since every election. This time the facts speak: The U.S. economy is on top of the world. Give it a rest.
@rweingarten We must stop the cruelty of the Democratic Party. Stop the violence of Antifa, the rule of the mob, and the lies of @rweingarten, etc, etc. Do not allow the AFT to think for you, think for yourself.
@ChelseaClinton Don't you me Day of Inaction?
@heifer109 @LG4LG So impressive. Can't wait to watch mainstream cable news November 6!
@AlisonDunn13 @CNN It already did---over and over again. https://t.co/mGil2ZvxSa
@CNN The outrage of the killing of this Muslim Brotherhood 9/11 journalist is getting more media coverage than Benghazi.
@SenSchumer @realbellasworld Chuck--time for your tears.
@JohnAndreu @MaddowBlog Derangement syndrom.
@MaddowBlog @maddow I will be watching to see you cry again on November 6. Keep spreading lies. History is Queen.
@Diane_7A @WenWillRun He is related to General George Gordon Meade the old snapping turtle üê¢.
@JohnWDean @Mainepablo I agree. The stock market is down 1,000 points and unemployment is the highest its been since 1787. If only Obama could save us now!
@RealGilbert Come back to Stern. We miss you!
@JohnFromCranber She can move to Cuba.
@GeorgeTakei Is this the same poll that had Clinton up 90 points on election day?
@SenWarren @nationalgridus @steelworkers I blame Trump for this!
@SenGillibrand Take him down! Our economy is in shambles. Highest unemployment rate in 50 years. Keep fighting for the American people. Trump = Globalist.
@mitchellvii @gatewaypundit Thank you Taylor Swift---pro woman's rights.
@ElectionLawCtr @MoodyBrew @PJMedia_com It is the parade for Hate Week.
@VP Thank you for your support of law enforcement.

@Pink_About_it @Hoosiers1986 If temperatures rise one degree in the next ten years we all die. I am ready to pay my carbon tax to Gore. The sun üåû has no say in this matter.
@CB618444 @Hoosiers1986 @nytimes @BeckyLikesBeer @Redheaded_Jenn @LadyRedWave @covfefeartist @ReneeCarrollAZ @Jamierodr10 @G1rly_Tattooed @Maggieb1B Have you thought of using the Old Gray Lady for üöΩpaper?
@Franklin_Graham @HelloTeamTrump @StephenAtHome @CBS I glad the DEMS ruined their chances of the big blue wave. Can't wait for election night.
@BeckyLikesBeer @HelloTeamTrump Oh my God. I thought the same thing. Walking Dead Ginsberg.
@AnthemRespect @HelloTeamTrump She should not be thrown out. Let the people vote her out.
@cenkuygur @ObamaLeaf @taylorswift13 @TedNugent I think you are missing the point. Isn't Swift pro woman anti evil old white man?
@SenatorHeitkamp @inforum @WDAYnews @Medium The article was posted in August. Haven't things changed since then?
@SenatorHeitkamp @federalreserve Can you explain how the trade war is hurting ND? Also the Federal Reserve was President Wilson's greatest mistake.
@jamiemlew @SenatorLankford What exactly were you looking for? Give it a rest.
@SenJoniErnst Thank you @SenJoniErnst for making this a great day for  America!
@ChrisVanHollen @ChrisVanHollen people did not come together --a mob did.
@SenSanders @SenSanders give it up already. We are not stupid.
@CoryBooker The rage of your party will get me out working again!
@ChuckGrassley We love you!
@HelenGym2015 @galaeiphilly What is a Philly Trans March?
@TheRevAl Kavanaugh's confirmation threatens the air we breath. Civilization, as we know it, will end because of him.
@TomCottonAR @hughhewitt @SenSchumer Thank you @SenTomCotton for making this day great üëç!
@Cernovich Midterms won't stop Trump. This train keeps rolling.
@rweingarten @DianeRavitch Public schools are failing. Isn't time to try something new?
@elizabethforma I am very üò†. That's why I am voting red. Thanks to all your friends for making this a beautiful historic dayüòÇ! What trick do you have next up your sleeve?
@SenWhitehouse Cry not....your party destroyed a woman---now you are blaming who?
@Scott_Gilmore @davidhogg111 Because the story fell apart due to facts---but let's not let facts get in the way of a good story.
@davidhogg111 Hang it up already.
@1776Stonewall Right on!
@sjredmond @realbellasworld This photo? https://t.co/v5kq8TiTF2
@SenMarkey is full of malarkey.
Come this time tomorrow America will become safe again. Thanks @realDonaldTrump for making us proud again.üòÑ
@SenBlumenthal is putting me to sleep.
@heckyessica @ShannonBream This is such a frace. I wished her notes were released. The party to the right is too nice.
@ShannonBream It is over. Time to give it a rest-- let's see what tomorrow brings.
@cooktw2_cook @usn112006 @ShannonBream Of course not-she is a victim.
@WarGameWOPR @usn112006 @dbongino @Revisit1776 Even if Flake Flakes tomorrow all is üëç.
@RioTazewell I will be waving the Blues away.
@Lisavee63 Umm -the truth did come out.
@Mzhoov Would you care to bet on it?
@Scotladywriter @PatriciaBronso7 @mikesoper98 @DougHarding7 @JeffFlake What difference at this point does it make anyhow?
@PatriciaBronso7 @mikesoper98 @Scotladywriter @DougHarding7 @JeffFlake Okay--"God Bless America --Land that I Love.... "
@PatriciaBronso7 @mikesoper98 @Scotladywriter @DougHarding7 @JeffFlake Who is ruining Hillary 's life? It is already ruined.
@PatriciaBronso7 @Scotladywriter @DougHarding7 @JeffFlake Grandstanding? He called for an investigation ---it came back clean. Please tell me what you are üëÑabout.
@Scotladywriter God bless these men!
@DomShow1210 She sure did! Listened to her remarks live on Progressive radio station. Host very üò†. Very funny.
@adri_bucher @CHCHNews Wish I didn't see that photo---but I hope that poor cat is in loving hands now.
@washedclean2006 @SenFeinstein You can fool some of the people most of the time--but in November some of the people see RED. Thanks for the help @SenFeinstein.
@Gerrianne1948 @janna_bastone @SenFeinstein Okay--are you ready to come back to Earth?
@SenFeinstein @rweingarten You are a disgrace to OUR country ---Thanks for helping us in November!
Art Bell is dead! I will always remember staying up past the dawn fascinated with excitement of tales of the occult. Dreams dashed: he will not be making another comeback to the airways. Thanks Mr. Bell. You changed my life. Few people have.
Hi! What hash tag were you looking for? https://t.co/MA2Lmvf1gC
@culovelee
@TeaPainUSA @realDonaldTrump I do not understand, please explain your reasoning.
@davidhogg111 Get through what?
@erikjburch @kaysintBB @restless_mortal @RK_Hayes @TeaPainUSA Be careful, this picture reeks of racism.
@TeaPainUSA You are right. All Trump supporters live on Mars. In fact since there is no evidence of Russian meddling, Mueller and friends will open a new investigation on the Red planet according to CNN.
@krassenstein Facts? Facts? Where? Where?
@ProudResister Why?
@maga_sky @PaulMcCartney @johnlennon @GeorgeHarrison @ringostarrmusic Beatles were great, just not as much as The Grateful Dead
@krassenstein Yes, I  agree, soon, in a year or two, Mueller will make a statement that his probe will be extended another 20 years.
@Notthedumblond @TeaPainUSA Or maybe the Russians will be accused of turning off our grids, when in fact, the CIA would be found tangled in wires.
@JohnnyfromCA @ProudResister Please explain the damage that has been made by Trump?
RT @Lynch39083: Virtual Science Labs: Get More with Fewer Resources https://t.co/eS4FfKSVFD #k12 #edtech https://t.co/gV4N2m477Z

@Alex_Verbeek Or even Huston for that matter.
@KellyClarkson4u @schooldaysfact That does not make sense. Inside it is you telling yourself to shut the F up. Make sense?
@michaelianblack In all seriousness, please move to Cuba. You receive free health care but no medicine.
@michaelianblack @davidgans May I ask which party does not believe in science? 	Democrats use made up science to fit their agenda.
@michaelianblack @davidgans You are right. There has never been a category 5 hurricane to hit the US. Fifty years ago severe weather did not even exist here. F Trump!
@ASavageNation I thought you already asked him.
Do you use a hankie?
I just heard someone on their cell phone say, "You fucked up my life, I don't care".
RT taking over C-Span? What is our government up to?
I hope there are no high jinks on this Friday the 13th!
Does anybody know how many times Alex Jones has said during his newscast that: "This is the  most important broadcast ever!"?
Does anybody really believe World War III could only be days away? https://t.co/cedzIVq1jl
@POTUS Dear Mr. President,	What was the remarkable progress? Sorry, I do not know what you are talking about.
@jaycaspiankang No. Have a blast.
@RogerJStoneJr @realDonaldTrump I can be a poll watcher in Philadelphia!
