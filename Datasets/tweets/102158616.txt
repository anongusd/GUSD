The #Mission Veterans Patriots are a win away from sweeping district competition in 16-5A DI. Friday's 55-38 victory over Palmview put the Patriots at 8-0 in district. A final showdown with Lopez looms in week 11 for Mission Vets.		#KRGV #RGV #txhsfb #football https://t.co/hncwSWretW
The stakes were high in Friday's game between La Villa and Woodsboro. The winner would claim a share of the 16-2A DII title. Although the Cardinals came on strong in the 2nd half, their rally would fall short 42-38.		#KRGV #RGV #txhsfb #football #LaVilla https://t.co/o8OpFTXh67
Valley View gave #Sharyland a tough test Friday night, but couldn't pull out the win. The Rattlers, who have locked up a district title, have a bye in week 11. They'll enter the playoffs on a six-game win streak after beating Valley View 14-10.		#KRGV #RGV #txhsfb #football https://t.co/MCJiMAkmzW
Mercedes picked up a much-needed win Friday night, keeping #Laredo Cigarroa winless in the process 21-0. The Tigers continue their push for the playoffs in week 11 with an important game against Roma. 		#KRGV #RGV #txhsfb #football #Mercedes https://t.co/Br2btCiATu
At Sams Stadium, #Brownsville Veterans took out Pace 21-14. The outcome puts the Chargers and Vikings in a tie for 2nd place in 16-5A DI behind Mission Veterans with 1 week to go in the regular season. 		#KRGV #RGV #txhsfb #football https://t.co/V9gFfoxyuF
It was a business trip for #Raymondville Friday night. The district champs shutout Progreso 45-0 for their 8th straight victory. The Bearkats have a bye in Week 11 before the postseason begins. 		#KRGV #RGV #txhsfb #football https://t.co/5a7IdsdD9c
Bird Bowl XXVI went to the #Harlingen Cardinals, who have now won the last 11 in the series. Here's a look at some of the first half highlights from Boggus Stadium. 		#KRGV #RGV #txhsfb #football https://t.co/kjfdlpsuVJ
The #PSJA Bears were hoping to clinch their 1st outright district title since 2005. #Mission had other ideas. Koy Detmer's Eagles flew to Pharr and handed the Bears their first district loss 24-7. PSJA can still take the title with a win over Juarez-Lincoln next wk.		#RGV #txhsfb https://t.co/JYdlaxUAD8
Friday's all-Edinburg battle at Richard R. Flores Stadium saw the Edinburg North Cougars claw the Economedes Jaguars 23-21. With the win, the Cougars kept their playoff hopes alive. 		#KRGV #RGV #txhsfb #football #Edinburg https://t.co/CmksaZ3AZL
There were no lack of highlights in tonight's district game between Hanna and Los Fresnos. The Eagles flew higher, taking the win 23-13. Hanna has a district title for the trophy case while the Falcons are out of playoff contention. 		#KRGV #RGV #txhsfb #football #Brownsville https://t.co/OyXle3VcTd
The Tinaco Bowl lived up to the hype with a thrilling finish for the fans at Bobby Lackey Stadium. Weslaco used a George Martinez FG in the final minute to get past Weslaco East 23-21. The Panthers now lead the Tinaco Bowl series 4-3. 		#KRGV #RGV #txhsfb #football #Weslaco https://t.co/MsSzZZMUTF
