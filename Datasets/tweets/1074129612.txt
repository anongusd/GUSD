The question we must ask ourselves: Are we a country that turns away victims of violence, drug trafficking &amp; rape? Or are we a country that ensures families are kept together, treated with dignity, and at their most vulnerable, provided safe refuge.
Many immigrants are coming through legal ports of entry and are getting denied. This Administration continues to pour gas on a chaotic situation, including teargassing migrants trying to come through legal ports of entry. But, they continue to cast blame on anyone but themselves.

Upholding voter purging in Ohio greenlights other states to purge registered voters from their rolls as a way to suppress and undermine our basic right to vote. https://t.co/7Xj9iFchSb
The Supreme Court‚Äôs ruling today is a chilling decision with serious repercussions for democracy in this country. The National Voter Registration Act is one of our country's central voting rights laws, but this decision has opened the door to weaken the protections it provides.
It is clear that now is the time for Congress to act and provide relief to the hundreds of thousands of Americans across our country. I call on my all colleagues to do what over 75% of Americans think is right and support a long term comprehensive solution for our #DREAMers.

Today is a reminder of the progress this country has made toward #equalpay, but how far we still have to climb. We won‚Äôt stop fighting until women earn what they deserve. Let‚Äôs close the gap and pass the #PaycheckFairnessAct. 4/4
If the annual wage gap were eliminated, a working woman in Texas would have enough money for: 		‚Ä¢15 additional months of child care;	‚Ä¢The full cost of tuition at a 2-year community college;	‚Ä¢78 more weeks of food; or	‚Ä¢ Nearly 7+ months of mortgage and utilities payments. 3/4
Minority women in Texas face an even greater wage gap. Black women in Texas are paid 58 cents and Latinas are paid 44 cents for every dollar paid to white men. 2/4 https://t.co/7XYt9To8IW
Just 28 percent of U.S. working women say they are confident they are paid the same salaries as their male counterparts. On average, Texas women who are employed full time, lose a combined total of nearly $77 billion every year to the #wagegap. 1/4
We need renewed talks on American counter-terrorism efforts in Africa. The heroic work of our 500 U.S. soldiers needs to be recognized by President Trump. His proposal to restructure the fed gov‚Äôt could make budget cuts to programs like @USAID. It‚Äôs a dangerously naive decision.
My thoughts are with the family of the American special forces solider killed and four wounded service members who came under firefight with Shabaab militants in Somalia, where troops have been training local forces in countering the terrorist group.
The #DFW Metroplex, has the highest uninsured rate of any Congressional District in the country. The Justice Department‚Äôs brief urging the Texas courts to strike down a provision of the #ACA jeopardizes the healthcare of millions of Texans, https://t.co/C1xzkzm2ad
It is critical that North Texans across #DFW can get to and from work. Long commute times cut into time on the job and with family. The much needed improvements to @NTExpress will generate significant economic and mobility benefits for the Metroplex. https://t.co/gLjAh9dMuh
.@TheJusticeDept‚Äôs decision to not defend the #ACA in #TX is a clear attack on the health of all Texans. All Americans deserve the right to access quality medical care regardless of their pre-existing conditions. We cannot deny care to Texans who need it the most.

We need an #InfrastructurePlan that makes daily life easier for America‚Äôs hard-working families, not one that makes your family foot the bill with more taxes and tolls.
President Trump‚Äôs mediocre $200 billion #InfrastructurePlan leaves states, cities, and local governments to foot the bill and puts additional pressure on their budgets that are already stretched too thin.
It‚Äôs no secret that fixing our nation‚Äôs crumbling roads, bridges, and railroads remain a priority for both sides of the aisle. Where Ds &amp; Rs differ is in our approach to spur job growth &amp; our commitment to ensuring the economic benefits from any plan reach the middle class 1st
How do you think @POTUS should honor our service members and our veterans? I have a few ideas but I want to hear from you. #PARADEAct

.@POTUS let me give you a few ideas you can actually advocate to recognize our service members.	-additional resources for the VA	-military spouse support	-ending veteran homelessness 	-prevention of veteran suicide
The PARADE Act makes sure that @POTUS does not take his personal feuds with authoritarian leaders from Twitter onto the streets of our nation.
The PARADE Act ensures that @POTUS cannot spend millions &amp; millions of taxpayer dollars on a military parade that strokes his big ego and his authoritarian wish list.
Today I introduced the PARADE Act b/c I'm tired of @POTUS treating the military and veterans as his political prop. 		PARADE = 	Preventing 	Allocation of 	Resources for 	Absurd 	Defense 	Expenditures https://t.co/fu5wMmEeiQ

There is no such thing as a "good government shutdown." @realDonaldTrump should be ashamed for suggesting that Ds are responsible when Rs control all 3 branches of gov't. #TrumpShutdown
The priorities Americans want to see addressed (pensions, DREAMers, health care for kids, etc) aren‚Äôt controversial. So why did Republicans choose a #TrumpShutdown over these bipartisan ideas?
I‚Äôm sick &amp; tired of watching as Republicans treat governing like a game. The #TrumpShutdown will not help ANYONE in my district. @HouseDemocrats are ready to negotiate but @POTUS keeps moving the goal post to appease his base #DoYourJob!
Republicans had no problem spending all their time &amp; votes on tax breaks for corporations &amp; the wealthiest. Now, they have no energy to fund #CHIP, #ProtectDREAMers, or pass a budget. @HouseDemocrats don't buy it. #TrumpShutdown
It‚Äôs fitting that the 1 year anniversary of @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs inauguration is also the first day of the GOP‚Äôs #TrumpShutdown. #AYearOfTrump
Despite that GOP has control of all 3 branches of gov't, they're proving they can't govern on their own. They need to quit holding #CHIP, #DREAMers &amp; disaster relief funding hostage to push their anti-immigrant agenda &amp; pass a clean CR to avoid a #TrumpShutdown
.@POTUS said the gov't could benefit "from a good shutdown". @HouseDemocrats don't want that. We want to fund critical bipartisan overdue priorities like #CHIP, veterans care, #DREAMAct &amp; need @HouseGOP to work w/ us to get it done. https://t.co/j1dNE0Ru3q

In honor of the 35th anniversary of #VRA1982 amendment, we say thank you to the 97th Congress who granted #votingrights to all Americans.
Before the 1982 VRA amendment, there were only 26 minority members of Congress. Today there are 102. #VRA1982 #CVRC #Progress1982
Today marks the anniversary of the 1982 amendments to the Voting Rights Act, which expanded access to the ballot box. #VRA1982 @CVRC
We must continue to fight for #votingrights today just as the 97th Congress did in 1982. #VRA1982 #CVRC
The Voting Rights Act amendments of 1982 prohibit any denial of vote based on race, color, or minority status. #VRA1982
It‚Äôs important to remember not only how far we've come, but how far we still need to go to protect the fundamental right to vote. #VRA1982
Today as we celebrate the 35th anniversary of the 1982 VRA amendment we are reminded of the progress our country has made. #VRA1982 #CVRC
#VRA1982 amendments said no to voter discrimination and voter disenfranchisement. #CVRC #Progress1982
The 1982 VRA amendments required voters to receive assistance due to blindness, disability, or inability to read or write. #VRA1982
35 yrs ago today the #VRA1982 amendments fundamentally influenced voting rights legislation by making it easier to prove a voting violation.
