Maneesha Mithal (w/ @FTC), Division of Privacy and Identity Protection, is now delivering the closing remarks. #FTCHearings
.@BillMcGev: Civil penalties are like shotgun behind the door. It's oiled and ready to go, but it is used sparingly. #FTCHearings
Parnes: Standard has to be reasonableness. Beyond that, it's important for FTC to provide guidance, which it has done through #StartWithSecurity and other initiatives. Encourages FTC to draft report setting forth data security practices, like it did for privacy. #FTCHearings
Richardson: Preventative measures are important b/c focusing on the time of breach is too late. When data is intimate, immutable, and used to make decisions about people, we can't return consumers to status quo. Not like being able to give money back. #FTCHearings
Hartzog encourages FTC action for poor data security practices, even in absence of breach, says we give tickets even if a car doesn't get into an accident. #FTCHearings
.@BillMcGev discusses his new research on 14 data security standards among which there seems to be convergence and consensus on what the duty is. #FTCHearings
Several panelists agree that focus should be on promoting good data security practices, as opposed to focusing solely on breaches. #FTCHearings

.@DanielSolove: There is no perfect security. Companies need to balance many different considerations to make correct risks analysis. However, harm to consumers is systematically under-valued. #FTCHearings
.@lisasotto: Cybersecurity to-do list is the wrong way to go. Companies need a risk-based approach with a foundational set of of principles, safe harbors, and accountability mechanisms. #FTCHearings
.@CRCalabrese: Harms from data breaches are significant, even if they're difficult to quantify or non-economic. #FTCHearings
.@dbthaw: Breaches raise policy concerns because information targeted - like SSNs - used for authentication, not just identification. #FTCHearings

.@JoshCorman responds: There is not a simple answer, but consumers know that four stars are better than three.
.@RKSlaughterFTC: How do you make device security transparency digestible to a consumer who may not understand cyber security? #FTCHearings
Corman adds: Providing more info to allow free market choice would not incentivize sellers or buyers to make different choices about inexpensive IP cameras. But their availability resulted in DDoS attacks on service providers. #FTCHearings
.@joshcorman: The Mirai Botnet was a real gut check for us. The botnet was of IP cameras that were Internet reachable, with fixed passwords, and that were unpatchable. #FTCHearings
@stshank @Swiftstories We adjusted it, let us know if it is better on the next panel. Thanks!
.@joshcorman: We realized that the cavalry wasn't coming to protect connected devices. Starting with public safety and human health, we asked private sector research community to connect w/ policymakers and formed @iamthecavalry #FTCHearings

.@ProtectToEnable: For risk management, companies think of IT vendors. But they should consider all vendors, from cleaning companies to IT services. Information can be compromised through physical or cyber attack. #FTCHearings https://t.co/FwWyWSFdOh
Garin Pace: Insurance market needs better information to tell insureds, "These are the controls that matter. Cannot do that asking only a handful of questions." #FTCHearings
.@wendynather: Even peer organizations don't necessarily face the same IT risks. A company needs to determine its cybersecurity priorities in light of its legacy technology and other factors. #FTCHearings
.@TroyLeach: Important to know where information is flowing within an organization and to assess risks to each asset in the organization. #FTCHearings
McAndrew w/ @Coalfiresys: Many small companies need basic cyber hygiene, including patch management and asset inventory. #FTCHearings

McCabe: From a corporate standpoint, reputation is ultimate concern. #FTCHearings
Moore: Obligation to disclose data breach creates incentive for data security. #FTCHearings

The FTC alleges that the average savings SoFi touted in its ads inflated the actual average savings ‚Äì sometimes even doubling it ‚Äì by excluding large categories of consumers.
According to the FTC, one online SoFi ad claimed, ‚ÄúRefinancing student loans saves $22,359 on average,‚Äù while another ad told readers to ‚ÄúStart saving on your student loans. Average monthly savings $292.‚Äù
In a complaint against Social Finance, Inc. and subsidiary SoFi Lending Corp., the FTC alleged that since at least April 2016, they made prominent false statements about loan refinancing savings in television, print, and Internet advertisements.

Farrell: Answer is that they don‚Äôt merit special antitrust attention. It‚Äôs all the same questions, but we know that antitrust is always fact specific. #FTCHearings

Farrell of @UCBerkeley said one of the reasons to define relevant markets is to help illuminate market power. #FTCHearings
.@TasneemChipty questions whether market definition is always necessary in cases involving multi-sided platforms. #FTCHearings

.@stevetadelis responds that it is murky. As an antitrust regulator, what is your theory of harm? If your theory of harm is that this looks big and it makes me feel uncomfortable, that is a problem.
@jmrybnicek asks whether there is a meaningful distinction between transaction platforms and ad-supported platforms. #FTChearings
.@skupor: Without these platforms, the economics of customer acquisition might be cost prohibitive. However, too much dependence on a platform can cause problems. #FTChearings
.@Moonalice argues that the exchange of services for data should raise concerns with regulators. #FTChearings
.@stevetadelis: new platforms like Uber, Airbnb, Taskrabbit are reincarnations of eBay‚Äôs model. eBay didn‚Äôt do it all because of ease of entry. Apart from social networking and search, barriers to entry are negligible because of multi-homing. #FTCHearings
.@lizaltman notes that a company doesn‚Äôt need to be born a platform ‚Äì it can evolve to become one. #FTCHearings
.@benthompson: the important steps for regulating aggregators are to constrain horizontal expansion, focus on transparency, and not to burden potential challengers. #FTCHearings
.@benthompson describes the difference between aggregators and platforms: a platform facilitates transactions between users and third parties while an aggregator is an intermediator. #FTCHearings

Yun asks about how we should consider the switching costs in the context of antitrust investigations. #FTCHearings
Correction: Yun asks what are the important views between two-sided platforms and complementary products? .@ce_tucker responds: If you have complementary goods you make money from selling goods, whereas with a two-sided platform you make money from bringing people together.
@mlegower @ce_tucker Yes, good catch!
Yun asks what are the important views between two-sided platforms and complimentary products? .@ce_tucker responds: If you have complimentary goods you make money from selling goods, whereas with a two-sided platform you make money from bringing people together. #FTCHearings
Yun asks what specific economic tests can be done to evaluate market power in a market that claims to be two-sided? #FTChearings
.@David_Evans1:  The notion that this is really hard is a bit overblown. There is not a lot of controversy among economists about what a platform business is.  #FTCHearings
Shelanski: This question is a very important‚Ä¶I do think the definitional issue is going to be front and center. #FTCHearings
Yun asks one of the issues is how to define platforms‚Ä¶what should we be looking for? Is it, do we know it when we see it,? Is it strength of network effect?  #FTCHearings
Shelanski: We can‚Äôt presume from the few recent historical episodes that any platform is vulnerable nor can we assume from the current market power we‚Äôre seeing today that the power will necessarily endure. #FTCHearings
Shelanski: The fact that someone has large market share might not reflect market power. #FTCHearings
Salinger: It‚Äôs important to distinguish between two-sided businesses and two-sided markets. For most two-sided businesses, there is competition on both sides of the business.
Seim: We would expect network markets to be conducive to larger firms but this also raises anti-competitive effects of scale.
https://t.co/lB5KbuSxmD
Participants: @David_Evans1 (w/ Global Economics Group)	Joseph Farrell (w/ @UCBerkeley)	Marc S. Rysman (w/ @BU_Tweets)	Michael A. Salinger (w/ @BUQuestrom)	Katja Seim (w/ @Wharton)	Howard Shelanski (w/ @GeorgetownLaw)	@ce_tucker (w/ @MITSloan)	Moderator: John M. Yun (w/ @GAI_GMU)
We're back! Now on to Session 1: The Current Economic Understanding of Multi-Sided Platforms. #FTCHearings
We are taking a short break and will be back in 5 minutes. #FTChearings
@ce_tucker: switching costs prevent users from using multiple platforms (multi-homing), but shift toward cloud makes porting data easier than it used to be and increases multi-homing.
@ce_tucker: everyone wants to be a platform: makes definitions hard
@ce_tucker: ‚Äúnetwork effects‚Äù describes the value that users obtain from other users on the platform.
Now we will hear remarks from @ce_tucker addressing the network effects of multi-sided platforms. #FTCHearings
@David_Evans1: Multisided platforms are increasingly common. The Internet has made it much easier to start that business and scale it on a global basis.
@David_Evans1: Platforms don‚Äôt simply offer complementary goods; complements usually sold to the same customer whereas platform sells to different customers. #FTCHearings
@David_Evans1: Platforms provide value to members of a group but only if it can provide access to enough members of the other group.
@David_Evans1: Platforms address externalities and do it through pricing, through design and tools and techniques embedded in the platforms.
@David_Evans1: Platforms reduce transaction costs. Do it in a couple ways.
@David_Evans1: platforms use a very old business model that is now better understood through new economic learning. #FTCHearings
Now, remarks by @David_Evans1 on the economics of multi-sided platforms. #FTCHearings
As we examine these platforms, @chopraftc says we must understand the structure of digital marketplaces and data collection practices. #FTCHearings

RT @MOhlhausenFTC: #BREAKING: @FTC reaches settlement w/ @PayPal. Consumers suffered real harm when @Venmo did not live up to the promises‚Ä¶
Venmo must also make certain disclosures to consumers about its transaction and privacy practices, and is prohibited from violating the Privacy Rule and the Safeguards Rule. Company also required to obtain biennial third-party audits of its compliance w/ these rules for 10 yrs.
As part of its settlement w/ @FTC, @Venmo is prohibited from misrepresenting:	1. Any material restrictions on use of its service	2. Extent of control provided by any #privacy settings	3. Extent to which it implements or adheres to a particular level of security.
FTC also alleges @Venmo‚Äôs #privacy settings misled consumers about extent to which they could control privacy of their transactions &amp; misrepresented extent to which consumers‚Äô financial accounts were protected by ‚Äúbank grade security systems.‚Äù
FTC: @Venmo‚Äôs delay in withdrawal of funds or reversal of underlying transactions after initially notifying consumers that funds were available resulted in many consumer complaints about financial hardships.
FTC says @Venmo sent its users notifications that money had been credited to their Venmo balances and was available for transfer to an external bank account but failed to adequately disclose that transactions were still subject to review &amp; funds could be frozen or removed.
