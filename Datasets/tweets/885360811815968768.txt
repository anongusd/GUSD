I dont like Bret Stephens, like most liberals, but the arrogance in left-wing media is amazing, the only way this person has to refute actual good advise from Stephens is to ego boost on how they are on some committee, the first three results for a search all show Bank of America https://t.co/lM7NEkKzz1
