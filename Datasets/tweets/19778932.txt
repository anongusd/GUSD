@YG You're exactly what's wrong with this country.  Advocating violence.  Hopefully the attacker is charged with a crime.
@SenWarren @SenateGOP Nope...the baby is born alive...and you voted to kill it.  Gross
@KamalaHarris So who'd be paying for these kids to go to college?
@GOPcowardice @SarahKSilverman a man who owns three homes, spends $300K on travel, brings in a million a year (2016, 2017)...seems pretty rich for a guy who wants to tax me to death
@hines_wooten @GovMikeHuckabee How is it a lie?
@GovMikeHuckabee @KamalaHarris voted to kill babies?
@DallasRedPill @SarahKSilverman @dallasredpill you are correct.  Funny as well that all the stars, who are mega rich, talk this game as well.  Smh
@SarahKSilverman Laughable from a man who owns three houses and is rich
@Jeanthejust @SweetenerTingz @FilmFatale_NYC You‚Äôre so woke

@KamalaHarris Best news @realDonaldTrump has heard all week
@chelseahandler boy, you've really fallen.
@mjfree @SavannahGuthrie Good Lord.  You guys are out of touch.  The media jumped to conclusions with zero facts and they are at least apologizing and trying to rectify the situation.  The only racists in this whole story are the Black Hebrew Israelites.  Try watching the whole video.
@PaulRabin1 @TODAYshow @MichelleSkime Normalization of something that shouldn't be is the news jumping to conclusions without facts simply to push the left's agenda.
@magita629 @TODAYshow Wrong.  Those who jumped to conclusions without facts owe these kids an apology
@MarcosBreton this is the perfect response to @davidhogg111 https://t.co/eshGZMaK1f
@davidhogg111 Yes, really.  The WH is right in this instance.
@OnceBittenBella @TODAYshow @SavannahGuthrie Oh Bella...the media jumped to conclusions with no facts and are now trying to rectify the #fakenews they spread, which has resulted in death threats against kids.  I get that the new narrative doesn't cater to your liberal view, but @todayshow is doing the right thing
@EdKrassen Since the report turned out to be unfounded, you should really delete this tweet.  You are part of the problem
@kylegriffin1 He was at the MLK memorial today.  Why spread #fakenews
@Quinnecticut @CrashChildress @MollyJongFast @chelseahandler Probably something stupid about Trump.  #TDS is real with you people
@MollyJongFast @chelseahandler He debate you under the table
@AnitaCreamer @DonaldJTrumpJr Aniya, really? It was a fake news story. Schiff ran with it and you still try to turn it around in Trump.  Come on!  This is way beneath u
@JodieGi61226330 @rockhall @DefLeppard Def Leppard is great but I'd agree...who have they influenced? On the other hand, Pat Benatar has influenced countless female rockers/pop stars and yet the RnR refuses to even consider her.  SMH
@oh_so_lori Lol.  Not even close
@bernice14 @Jeremy4America @_Ash_Moss_ @SikesSteve @AOC No it‚Äôs not.  Most of these kids with low grades, just coast.  And then people line u make excuses for them and expect society should give them their money to help them along. Silly
@Anomaly4u @Jeremy4America @_Ash_Moss_ @SikesSteve @AOC @anomaly4u why don‚Äôt you work harder to become a CEO so you can freely redistribute your wealth? Ah..because it‚Äôs not easy being a CEO.  If it was, everyone would be one.  Stop relying on others for more money.
@1proudliberal @ProgFrog57 @krassenstein @Comey Actually blame the democrats for putting up a terrible candidate
@LunaisAmerica @AOC We‚Äôre u concerned when Obama had them on cages or so you have faux rage and suffer from DTS?
@_lalaland_1 @myrtle @RepAdamSchiff Re-think being educated? How about spelling ‚Äúwaist‚Äù correctly? I don‚Äôt think we should be taking advice from @_lalaland1_

@chelseahandler @davidhogg111 He couldn‚Äôt get in the the UCs in California but got into Harvard?  Please
@PensionPromises @MarcosBreton Truly disengenious of Marcos.  I like Marcos but this is the exact thing Trump is talking about when he says "Fake News."
@MarcosBreton Not fair to say "Trump."  Six journalist in the US were killed...two from weather related stories.  Nothing to do with Trump.  The other 4 were from a shooting from a disgruntled man who had sued the journalist for defamation in 2012.  Nothing to do w/Trump.  You must do better
@rockhall @mulaney The fact that @officialbenatar was snubbed again?
@thecheckdown Sweet
@Ocasio2018 Maybe @ocasio2018 should welcome all of the illegals into her home.  Oh wait she can't afford living quarters on her paltry $174K a  year salary.  SMH
@RLynn1966 @FLOTUS @PressSec @WhiteHouse @rlynn1966 you are a buffoon.
@LanceMoore1982 @EveRabi1 @chelseahandler Nothing of course because they have faux outrage...only when it's convenient for them.  SMH

@brifazio well at least we agree on one thing.
@brifazio Def watch Fox and CNN but never Alex Jones.  Sorry
@brifazio Pay attention. The photo was a response to someone who had showed the same photo with Trump but alas.  Not really an argument, more of an observation. You're not as righteous as you believe u r.  U make fun of people &amp; it's ok because well..you're a lib. Lib logic...lol
@brifazio But you did mock an old woman - called her senile.  So you've shown your character....you made fun of someone with a disease (senility) and it was a women.  Kind of flies in the face of you being a good person.  Carry on..continue showing your true colors.  LOL
@brifazio You're unhinged.  You called a poor old women "senile" in one of your tweets.  Calling someone senile just because you don't like what she has to say seems mean.  Sad
@brifazio It same record the left always play...if you disagree with the left you're automatically a racist, misogynist, etc etc.  And Shut Up...you seem like a nice person.  LOL.  Maybe your tweets will come back to haunt you since you call people names, tell them to shut up etc
@brifazio is 5 months ago not the past? and of course...tolerant left turns to name calling.  Shocking.  LOL
@brjones1 @chelseahandler @emilyslist @RosenforNevada @kyrstensinema Really? asking the thoughts of a comedian for your politician? LOL
@BreitbartNews Well isn't that the pot calling the kettle black.  SMH
@brifazio Yet you rip a guy because he said or did something stupid in the past.  The tolerant left.  Yeah right.  Lol
@brifazio have you never said a joke that could be offensive to some segment of society? are you trying to say you're perfect? get over yourself.  SMH
@AmySherrod4 @Wiguyosh @StevenStotts1 @irishyanke @KamalaHarris @Esqueuezme We wouldn't have to if you weren't such a hypocrite.  Had you complained about this 4 years ago, then go for you.  If you didn't, you are a true hypocrite
@Acosta Huckabee answered you perfectly.  U aren‚Äôt a journalist &amp; that fact that CNN makes fun of ones physical appearance says everything we need to know about u. Why don‚Äôt u be the change &amp; actually report instead of making it your goal to vilify this admin &amp; anyone associated with it?

@camperoh @craigbradley5 @thehill She's a cunt because of her dad? you sound like an idiot.  BTW - Trump has deported far less illegals than Obama or any other president did.  So by your way of thinking, I guessing you have nothing good to say about Obama's wife or daughter?

yes please https://t.co/XiMDDP02md
@thejuce LOL.  Now people are breaking into your house?  Dude you are a crazy blaming victim. You will be a failure forever.  Sad
@thejuce I've looked at your info; stated there are a few bad apples; but you continue to believe you are owed a "kingdom";ur not owed shit
@thejuce I think u may b a racist against whites &amp; u certainly have painted yourself as a victim. u have as many opp. to succeed as i do
@thejuce Actually you have.  You have blamed whites for all of your problems; blamed police.  Tied in the holocaust..which is incomparable.
@thejuce you have done that from the very beginning.  Angry about everything and everyone who isn't black.
@thejuce all of us agree 2 that.   BLM does incite violence against cops. Chanting slogans like 'pigs in a blanket, fry 'em like bacon.
@thejuce I think they are a racist violent group who promotes hatred against cops.  Absolutely
@thejuce what video about sri lanka?
@thejuce https://t.co/N6NugrkWX4  Good article that you'll disagree with completly
@thejuce It's a fine OpEd piece by someone who writes about inequality as she sees it.  others see it differently. Welcome to America!
@TeapotCowboy Thanks for clarifying.  My stance was against Beyonce.  Another person inciting racism
@thejuce are u successful? if not, y not? if being a billionaire is your idea of success, than 99.9% of us r failures.r u blaming whites?
@thejuce i know many whites who are to successful. And Indians and Asians and Hispanics.  So...
@thejuce in college.  Just the same as many of our black friends, and asian friends and indian friends.. sigh
@thejuce i'm not a billionaire &amp; i spend a great amount of time with my family.  I've worked hard, my wife works hard and our kids are
@thejuce oh brother. You'll live a miserable life being angry all the time.  Free yourself of anger and i bet you soar!
@thejuce I'm glad for you. I think your mind would be freer if you weren't so angry and blaming others for you not being a billionaire
@thejuce without it and won't blame someone else because I don't have it.
@thejuce none of us need 2 b billionaires.  Is that what u need to b happy? I don't think so. who cares? I'd love a Mill but i'll survive
@thejuce i look at ur photo, the nice shirt you're wearing and you seem like u're doing ok. Instead of being neg.&amp;angry, do something great
@thejuce u just sound angry and it sounds like you'd rather downplay any successes but instead make excuses why people can't succeed.
@thejuce they were born rich, etc.  No all of these people Obama, Winfrey, my community work hard and are living a decent life
@thejuce none of these people r being shot by police because they are upstanding people.  u have made excuse after excuse
@thejuce I live in a 4K house community filled with blacks, asians, hispanics, whites...all the same socio economic standing
@thejuce listen Obama is the most powerful man in the world; oprah 1 of the richest, carson insanely smart doc; beyonce &amp; husband crazy rich
@thejuce I know a lot of black families who work reg. jobs like me &amp; are living comfortably.  No excuses, just hard work;upstanding citizens
@thejuce the point is, she worked hard &amp; is now one of the richest people in the world. She didn't make excuses.
@thejuce more excuses. Oprah- poor. Beyonce middle class. Ben Carson became a Dr.  BTW...you don't look like your hurting either.
@thejuce whites and chicanos showed up as well.  Again..some cops r bad...most r not.
@thejuce how do justify where Obama, Oprah, Senators, Carson, Beyonce, etc r? They work hard &amp; made a life for themselves instead of excuses
@thejuce b an upstanding citizen &amp; u won't have issues.  Act like a criminal &amp;u'll have issues. Most peo. aren't racist&amp; not all cops r bad.
@thejuce slavery is 300 years old.  Nothing to do with u.  U have had every opp. to make a good life.  What u choose to do is on u.
@thejuce u blame everyone else.  u blame whites, somehow tied in jews; downplay hispanics&amp; asians &amp; how they aren't discriminated against
@thejuce i live in highly populated black community; my daughter dates a black guy; most r good people doing good things &amp; have no problems
@thejuce dude..you guys are killing your own race at an outrageous pace and you don't give 2 fucks about it.  Stop blaming everyone else
@thejuce Sorry..gotta work.  I hope you can go from angry to doing something positive.  Wishing you a good and happy life!
@thejuce i can't justify every cops action; they should b held accountable when they do wrong. E.Garner...wrong..  MBrown justified
@thejuce he's disgusting.  However, didn't he give up easily once pulled over? Instead M. Brown fights with a police officer in his car.
@thejuce the ? is why are they profiled? if they were upstanding citizens, there wouldn't be an issue. Work to do good, be a positive person
@thejuce Nothing more i can say. u play the victim/race card &amp; nothing i say can change your mind.  Good luck 2 u on your endeavors
@thejuce Again...live a non criminal life and you most likely won't have problems.  Engage in criminal activity and problems will arise.
@TeapotCowboy @Streetpolitik @UnionUSA stupid comment.  Never once did anyone say Klan outfit was ok.  #lamerebuttal
@thejuce https://t.co/QC5iSkIQ2z
@thejuce seems the race card is saved for the black community.  Asians, Hispanics, Whites don't pull it regularly
@thejuce we won't see eye to eye.  I believe cops are good people doing their job and it's a hard job that doesn't get enough credit
@thejuce So no crimes were committed, cops just picked up people for no reason whatsoever? #livinginadreamworld
@thejuce why doesn't the black community focus on black/black crime?  Far outnumbers cop on black crime. more whites are killed by cops
@thejuce the BL blames cops but never takes into account that they wouldn't be in a sit. if they weren't committing crimes in the 1st place.
@thejuce I've read differently but i won't argue the point.  I've been wrong before. And can admit it.
@thejuce how u brought BLM and the Holocaust 2gether is amazing. Wasn't it African leaders who sold slaves to America? I could b wrong
@thejuce Germany may have paid the Jews.  I had nothing to do with the Holocaust just as neither me nor you had anything to do with slavery.
@NBA guess  DeMarcus Cousins won't be celebrating a 4000 year old tradition.  SMH
@thejuce found it.  i said another racist comes out of the woodwork.
@thejuce nope...just said "typical BLM" don't think i said racist.
@thejuce stay away from crim. activity and u'll have no prob w/the po po.  But again, the #BLM peeps blame others instead of looking inwards
@thejuce I didn't call you a racist...u called me one along with other names. U've been pretty vile from the start.
@thejuce LOL.  Good one.  And name calling.  I guess I hit a nerve
@thejuce now i'm a racist because I don't subscribe 2 ur "truth?" Take responsibility 4 your own actions stop blaming others..u'll b happier
@thejuce I think the dipshit is u.  U don't take responsibility for your actions, but blame others.  Typical #BLM.
@thejuce U think u know the "truth" u wouldn't know it if it was a 2x4 that smashed you in the face.  #TheForceIsntSoStrongWithThisOne
@thejuce oh good another #racist comes out of the woodwork.  #SomePeopleOnlySeeWahtTheyWant2see
@Streetpolitik I guess we are at a standstill.  I disagree with your "truth" as well.  So it's a draw
@Streetpolitik I wasn't smiling.
@Streetpolitik "irrate" you? no.  Irate. "brainsless" no  Brainless.  And my "truth" is not "libel" makes no sense.
