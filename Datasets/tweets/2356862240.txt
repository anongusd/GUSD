@JohnCornyn You should too.  You just sent a tweet extolling the Freedom of the Individual!
@JoeNBC 1. Sad you hate @realDonaldTrump so badly you would equate Kraft with Epstein.  2. Sad you denigrate Kraft, a widower, yet you cheated on your wife and kids.                                3. Sad you never mentioned Epstein’s frequent Lolita Express companion @BillClinton

@RealSaavedra There’s your primary opponent for @realDonaldTrump   Unimpeachable integrity with a hell of a sense of humor.
@tribelaw @MichelleObama @BarackObama Trump was wrong to attack the First Lady then or now. He’s a boor, and has no class which friend and foe agree. But she and her daughters have the best security IN THE WHOLE WORLD so how did he put them in danger with his Kenya nonsense?
@nytopinion The law is designed to employ lawyers. Period. Everything else is secondary. Add to that lawyers get paid like the 1% and you are forced to use one

@MSNBC @JoeNBC It’s about illegal people, not brown people. The race is close because you’ve managed to deceive a number of people with your relentless daily barrage accusing @realDonaldTrump of treason, collusion, and racism. Why were you and @MikaBrezinski brown-nosing  him for two years?

@tribelaw It’s not so much they support Trump it’s that Dems are so far left voters are left with a Hobson’s Choice- Socialism and high taxes vs. keep what you earn and fewer regulations. Not a hard call. Running #CrookedHillary is why @realDonaldTrump won. Own it.

@benshapiro I’m watching @JoeNBC and they claim Russian leaking of emails led to those previously hidden FACTS concerning @HillaryClinton’s ability to be president to be used in debates. This gave voters enough doubt to tip it to @realDonaldTrump   As I’ve said all long, they did us a favor

@JoeNBC It’s more fair to say you’re an idiot
@nytopinion @Edsall The answer is simple: the Democrats ran the most corrupt candidate in history. #CrookedHillary was so distasteful that millions voted for @realDonaldTrump and millions more stayed home.
@secupp @Mediaite How about you start with being honest?  That wouldn’t require giving anyone a break but a public weary of #FakeNews

@NARAL I just have one question:  In the 40 month gestation period, is there ANY POINT IN TIME where the “fetus” becomes a US citizen with a right to life?  Conservatives seem to say 20. I can’t get anyone on the left to pick a number.  They don’t want to admit that number is over 36

@MichaelAvenatti @realDonaldTrump Any time a president is destroyed it harms the nation as a whole. It seems half the country is intent on doing just that. You have calculated your path to power as leading that mob by taking the lowest road possible. America is tired of the vulgarity and by 2020 you’ll be history

@vselvidge @Tennesseine @ealight461 @GOP You have to look at the lack of political goodwill between the two parties. The Democrats have poisoned the well for the nominating process. It began with Robert Bork and gone downhill. Calls for investigation rang hollow after 11th hour hit job. Just a delay tactic
@Tennesseine @vselvidge @ealight461 @GOP As for the people who knew it for decades, the four people she named, including her friend, denied it or didn’t remember. You have a lot of followers so I assume you have some standard of honesty but doesn’t have to be the case
@Tennesseine @vselvidge @ealight461 @GOP Ha! A polygraph test! Two questions that were really one question. “Do you believe your story?”  We don’t know lots. She was hooked up for hours. If that is your standard of a polygraph test then you are nothing but a partisan trolling the Twitter world
@vselvidge @Tennesseine @ealight461 @GOP If all that was done prior to an Eleventh Hour hit by Feinstein didn’t uncover this, all 10 Democrats should resign especially the women.

@UpprDkr @KamalaHarris If she really believed in the #metoo movement she wouldn’t do this to Kavanaugh’s daughters
@Squirl00 And what ‘Law’ is he above?  What crime was committed? Again, want your son’s freedom to rest on litigating a 36 year old memory?  We know memory is faulty and any lie detector test would only indicate she believes her story. I’m sure she does. Doesn’t mean it happened
@Squirl00 What about Kavanaugh’s wife and daughters?  Do they have any rights?  Would you want your son to face this?  To answer, if she was my wife and hid it 36 years and during his appeals court hearings in 2006, I would say too late.  Why give him 12 yrs to “take away women’s rights”?
@Squirl00 Cosby had dozens of public accusations over years. Kavanaugh has zero beyond this one. If Ford has 200 names why let him get on the appeals court and other courts?If you care about justice and women, ask why Feinstein sat on it until it fit her political motives

@LarryGatlin @gatlinbrothers I’ll bet Rudy was a pain in the ass
@dmataconis @ananavarro @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump I suggest you reserve judgment. He is an imperfect messenger but came at a time when we needed to change the status quo. Our government is no longer trustworthy and needs to be shrunk
@dmataconis @ananavarro @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump Don’t disagree. Too bad the Dems ran #CrookedHillary against him. She was the only candidate he could beat because she had the most ‘vote against’ voters
@dmataconis @ananavarro @FLOTUS We both know better than that. Each day @realDonaldTrump faces a relentless barrage of the worst Twitter has to offer. That he uses it to level the playing field brings cries of bullying.
@AGuyFromMarfa @lubbockonline Conversations with senators that served with him
@ananavarro @dmataconis She was clearly talking about you.
@vermontgmg Beyond phony claims about the Russians, what exactly should concern us? That he got movement in North Korea? That he passed a tax cut? That ISIS is virtually defeated?  I am more concerned about a corrupt @FBI than this bull in the china closet
@AGuyFromMarfa @lubbockonline Behind the scenes, he killed legislation that he supported in public. He was loyal first to his career, second to power of lawyers and lastly to his constituents
@lubbockonline Duncan was an uninspired choice. Mediocre lawyer, mediocre politician, below average chancellor. Good riddance for whatever reason
@dick_nixon It’s the hammering, sir. It broke him
@ezraklein @JohnHogHannah1 @AnnieLowrey Yawn. It’s like saying coffee is addicting. So what. It doesn’t kill you and for many people it helps. So what do you have against giving Americans the choice? Please defend jail as the answer
@marklevinshow @Roxie_Wilcox No. Just has a related affliction #TrumpDerangementSyndrome which should subside sometime in January 2025
@ChrisMegerian @KatonLaw It’s not normal for @nytimes to slant the story for political gain. Oh wait...sorry. It is
@PeteSessions Yet you continue to imprison people for marijuana use and block all bills aimed at reforming our draconian drug laws. Marijuana has been proven to reduce opioid use. Your willful ignorance is killing American veterans #NORML @JohnCornyn @GregAbbott_TX
@DaShanneStokes @pamwallace @realDonaldTrump Two questions: What is a ‘public intellectual ‘?                                  What kind of doctor are you?
@MaxBoot It should be titled The Corrosion of the American Character. That we had the choice of a Crook or a Lunatic says all it needs to say about how far we’ve fallen
Think Twitter needs to tune its filters https://t.co/d25nqdUqm1
@bessbell Or at least try to be funny
@krassenstein @Britpoptarts After @BillClinton set the new standard I guess @realDonaldTrump voters said “if you can’t beat them, join them”
@WalshFreedom @ealight461 I’ll take my chances
@Peter_Wehner Go buy yourself a pink hat
@danpfeiffer @lskurrus How exactly is that different from what they are doing now?
@jpriordan12 @SenWarren So in 20 years when Yemeni terrorists attack American we will ask “Why do they hate us? Is it that we love our freedom?”
@larryelder @irritatedwoman @BarackObama Plus he didn’t build that! The prestige of the office of President is owned by the people. He and Clinton should be taxed at 90%
@Acosta @CNNSitRoom Maybe if you blind fools blame Trump for this Americans will finally realize we supply weapons to the devil and have for decades
@Acosta @CNNSitRoom You know this is not the first American bomb dropped on Yemeni children. We proudly call the Saudi’s our good customers.  @realDonaldTrump just bragged in how much military equipment they are buying. Wahhabi devils that caused 9/11.
@RosstradamusNFL @Stefanheggelund @SenSanders @jcelden You’d better be white as hell and rich or they don’t want you
@SenSanders Look. You’re old. If you’re looking for free medical care you now have a list of places that would certainly welcome you. I’m sure we can also get a GoFundMe to buy the tickets.
@Nysteveo2AOLcom @pamwallace So you are just now getting what @JoeNBC and @morningmika are about?  They welcomed @realDonaldTrump in 2016 when it was all one big joke. He cut them loose and the embittered nonsense you’ve seen since is what you call news.
@BJSymons I wouldn’t think you’re still welcome in Oxford 🤣🤣
@RWPUSA The voters pretty much told you what we all think of you. An empty suit with a nice head of hair
@tribelaw Yes!  And @JohnBrennan should have respected that privilege given him by the American people by not becoming a paid political hack.
@FDRLST Does that not then point to a Creator?
@JohnCornyn @KimStrassel @WSJopinion Clean house at the @FBI   Fire everyone that had anything to do with it.                                              Remove J Edgar Hoover’s name from my justice building!!
@KamalaHarris If you were ever remotely serious you would publish your own recommendations for debate. But your Tweets are limited to bromides.
@Super70sSports @dick_nixon Garciaparra couldn’t carry Hammerin’ Hank’s jock strap
@Lawrence You are a complete phony.   Your lack of self-awareness is exceeded only by your sense of self-importance.
@lsilbers @tom_martino1 @AriFleischer Brennan lied under oath to Congress. He should have lost his security clearance that day. He is now a paid political commentator and has no business with a top secret security clearance
@JoeNBC If what you say is true, why is it only 47%-44%?  Voters that stupid or you that bitter?  I get that your brown-nosing of @realDonaldTrump backfired but you let him change you!  He broke you, Joe. Sad!
@GregAbbott_TX Quite true but it is not yet a great country. A great country has much more equal justice than we do. A great country is not blind to the misery it causes others in the name of “we know what’s good for you “
@KamalaHarris I thought his legal decisions were a matter of public record. You should have no trouble discerning what he thinks. It’s too bad you are willing to put your career in front of your constituents but that is your sole consistency
@cgwegene @SenWarren @jimcramer Yeah, like the car companies that ended up stiffing all their retirees
@JoeNBC Anyone would tell you that it was true in NY at that time, especially Wall Street and Banks looking for diversity cover. Even if it was for the wrong reason it benefited thousands more. @realDonaldTrump didn’t cause it.  He wasn’t lamenting it. He just observed it
@SpiderFootball #97
@SteveSReynolds @tribelaw You got Thomas because they torpedoed Robert Bork. The Democrats poisoned the process 30 years ago and it has only gotten worse over time.
@tribelaw Why did the Democrats vote for him for the appeals court if he was hiding million pages? Sound pretty incompetent to me
@JEANNEinWa @TobyandMel #TamirRice was murdered by the Cleveland police and nothing happened. It’s the tip of the iceberg. Blind loyalty to our institutions is more dangerous than harsh skepticism
@realDonaldTrump Stop making his job so hard by hiring your idiotic sycophants in the first place
@GregAbbott_TX Stop tollroads that waste precious right of way.
@tribelaw @chelseahandler You’re quoting @chelseahandler ? Seriously?  Did Jerry Springer hack your account?
@MSNBC @MSNBC Playing up Omorosa is like Billy Martin kicking dust on the umpire’s shoes. Same results.
@davidaxelrod @realDonaldTrump That’s all that all television is about. Everything is just an offshoot of Jerry’s original show. Trump rode the lowest common denominator into the White House. Don’t think you Hillary voters are any better. She’s why he won.
@rolandscahill @EdSkipper Then why does he need to interview @realDonaldTrump ?
@QuancyClayborne @lionessmom76 Yet you remain clueless that it was @HillaryClinton crookedness that prompted millions more to stay home or vote for @realDonaldTrump   He will win re-election handily
@JoeNBC What evidence?
@JoeNBC It’s pretty simple, Joe. Either Mueller has enough to charge him or he doesn’t. If he has to trap @realDonaldTrump during an interview then he doesn’t have anything to start with
@larryelder And when you consider most of that is in East St. Louis...
@AriFleischer @Momatree48 And had the Democrats selected a candidate with more integrity than @realDonaldTrump , a Democrat would be in the White House
@SenFeinstein Ask your driver for a copy
@KellyCanuckTO We have your back, Canada. Both of us have had to deal with unstable leadership. This will pass
@JeffreyGuterman @OMAROSA And he would know
@tedlieu @FBI @realDonaldTrump If he did something wrong, why does Mueller need to interview him? He should have enough to charge him without that
@BillKristol And what exactly is the threat?  The Russians are stopped and we get #CrookedHillary ? I’ll take my chances with the Russians
@realDonaldTrump If you want to make the change permanent, legalize marijuana and take away an instrument of the state that punishes minorities disproportionately. If you agree jail is not the answer for users, this is the only sane choice. @NORML
RT @JD_Tuccille: As a third-party voter--I voted for Gary Johnson--I'm responsible only for voting for a better candidate than either Trump…
@PreetBharara You should know. You’re an expert at it
@tribelaw If he doesn’t have enough to charge @realDonaldTrump without interviewing him he should shut it down
@GregAbbott_TX It’s an invasion of privacy
@KamalaHarris So your solution is to subsidize billionaire landlords?
@RealSaavedra Talks a lot. Says nothing. She will be a short-lived phenomenon
@Molly3186 Don’t give me the choice between Donald Trump and a crook like you did last time
@SethAbramson She should have to take a DNA test and reveal her own composition.  How do we know she is not Russian?
@BillKristol She would be so much happier in Sweden
@MSNBC @NBCInvestigates Everything added together doesn’t equal one paid Russian speech by @BillClinton
@girlsreallyrule @animemoto @HillaryClinton This guy https://t.co/iCgva149uf
@girlsreallyrule @animemoto @HillaryClinton Why does she sound like the Chief Inspector in the old Pink Panther movies?  Lunacy
@WWMcClyde M-m-m-mel Tillis
@KamalaHarris All that deficit spending and government control of money supply has shredded the purchasing power of the dollar. You have participated in the cruel silent theft of inflation especially how it affects hard assets
@JoeNBC @LindseyGrahamSC What if it was started for partisan reasons?
@jamestaranto Not to mention a cold-blooded killer
@tomangell Looking more forward to when that ‘wind comes sweeping down the plains’
@GovMikeHuckabee @stringfellowfr4 Am I the only one who doesn’t understand why our justice building is named for J. Edgar Hoover? @FBI @realDonaldTrump
@RepJimRenacci Stop @PeteSessions from blocking all marijuana reform which forces more veterans to suffer needlessly. It has shown to reduce opioid dependence by 25%. Time to defeat @PeteSessions for abusing our veterans due to willful ignorance
@ThomasWictor Another Leo. Thought so
@KamalaHarris Then stop deficit spending
@LizSly Let’s see...15 of 19 9/11 hijackers were Saudi...
@JasonHalle Or just don’t run someone as corrupt as #CrookedHillary
@ThomasSowell Envy
@brhodes @JasminLucci You just simplified it by tapping everybody in America via the NSA
@TheDanglyBits @BillKristol My point being such a generalization by someone of his former stature is ignorant. @realDonaldTrump won because he ran against the most corrupt candidate in history. Combo of white men, white women and disgusted voters who stayed home
@BillKristol I guess not counting the ones that died saving your people from the Nazis
@negrosubversive @Chillselda When sesquipedalians meet
@dick_nixon And to charge him in his home park!  Dave Henderson said they never rescue a teammate unless at home
@dick_nixon Note the raised knuckle of the middle finger, standard fighting fist of that generation
@ThomasWictor Or limit it to old James Bond movies
@r1chh007 @ABC @CBSNews @NBCNews @CNN @MSNBC Crack addicts need crack. Law of Nature
@cjnapoet @marcthiessen @PostOpinions @HillaryClinton Then what was the reset button?  The $500,000 speaking fee to @BillClinton ?  The $145,000,000 to the Clinton Foundation?  Hire Steele?  You are a willful idiot
@marcthiessen @PostOpinions Thank you for looking out for ALL OF US 🇺🇸
@gunsupnation @BJSymons John Scovill and Tom Wilson
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Like the Lincoln Bedroom? #CrookedHillary
@Apinak @paulbam3 @throwaway_acct @alexandraerin @KillerMartinis Nonsense
@paulbam3 @throwaway_acct @alexandraerin @Apinak @KillerMartinis No, I’m just saying we do not ignore or mistreat poor people in significant numbers or as a matter of policy. Surely some people fall through the cracks and we all want safety nets. Private and public charities work to close the gap. Together
@Apinak @paulbam3 @throwaway_acct @alexandraerin @KillerMartinis Sweden has fewer people than NYC and Denmark is smaller than Houston. And they are the most racially homogeneous white peoples on earth. Meaningless comparison
@alexandraerin @Apinak @KillerMartinis 2018 America is the most generous nation in history
@alexandraerin @Apinak @KillerMartinis Yes agree. Paul’s jacket money was private. That it goes to those making less than him achieves from the private sector what you seek from the public spending.
@alexandraerin @Apinak @KillerMartinis Largely true. But we can’t divide it up ever Friday night
@alexandraerin @Apinak @KillerMartinis Not welfare but inflation of hard assets: land, gold, oil, homes-capital goods
@alexandraerin @paulbam3 @throwaway_acct @Apinak @KillerMartinis No argument there but it was a poorly stated point if that was it. I’ve long said that excess government spending leading to reduction in the purchasing power of the dollar is the biggest gift to the 1% and fatal to middle class and poor
@paulbam3 @throwaway_acct @alexandraerin @Apinak @KillerMartinis What passes for poor in America are people with homes, cars, cell phones and enough disposable income to make some choices.  There is plenty of money for true needs including foreign aid. Communism failed too
@Apinak @paulbam3 @throwaway_acct @alexandraerin @KillerMartinis It’s called socialism. It’s purest form it is the greatest tragedy in history.
RT @ComfortablySmug: Best part is that the inclusive progressive New York Times is run by an old white guy who got the job from his dad who…
@Apinak @alexandraerin @KillerMartinis Well your namesake did the best job of it. Old Papa Joe put it in trust and no Kennedy in four generations has had a job. But they sure want to rob everyone else’s grave.
@Apinak @paulbam3 @throwaway_acct @alexandraerin @KillerMartinis There are probably 20,000 people in America who can give away 50% or more of their wealth and not miss it. Everyone else has to budget charity
@paulbam3 @throwaway_acct @alexandraerin @Apinak @KillerMartinis When you treat yourself to something nice- like a new car-do you say “I’ll just give the purchase price to poor people instead “?
@paulbam3 @throwaway_acct @alexandraerin @Apinak @KillerMartinis The vast majority of people give money away when they feel they have financial security. Only the very rich can give 50% or more of their wealth to charity. I’m just saying Paul spending on himself doesn’t mean he is not generous with his money
@paulbam3 @throwaway_acct @alexandraerin @Apinak @KillerMartinis Paul probably gives money to charity. But he can’t just give it all to charity nor should money be given to people simply because they are poor. Freedom and responsibility of two sides of the same coin. There is plenty of money to help the truly needy.
@alexandraerin @Apinak @KillerMartinis One more thing you fundamentally miss: If rich people didn’t desire to consume luxury goods, millions of jobs would be wiped out. The ultra rich give most of it away anyway in the end
@alexandraerin @Apinak @KillerMartinis Your ‘work’ makes no sense. If you take the jacket money and give a dollar to 15,000 people, how many times will Manafort have to do this before his beloved jacket maker is paid?  When does Paul get his jacket-never?
@alexandraerin @Apinak @KillerMartinis Simple. You could say that about everything except groceries and rent. Markets don’t work that way, because people are not motivated that way. I am sure the jacket maker is generous with the charities he cares about as are all of those paid along the way by this transaction
@KillerMartinis The leather and fur business pays the bills for a lot of families. One guy knocking out a $15,000 ostrich jacket is a blessing to that industry. Taste and money have never been related and Manafort is no exception
@Apinak @KillerMartinis Spending creates jobs the same as investing. Ostrich jacket paid tailor, skin supplier, store owner, salesman, landlord, packaging firm, delivery firm and tax man. Any questions?
@GarbageHuman_ I thought these yellow people survived on their wits
@FBI You should take J Edgar Hoover’s name off your building. That would tell a lot of people that you actually get it
@AngelaAngalcina @BillKristol Envy doesn’t look good on you
@tomangell @RepCummings My grammar is getting bad.
@tomangell @RepCummings It is. So is alcohol and tobacco. Ask @RepCummings to rank them for deadly effect. Let’s see how honest he is. Tobacco is the deadliest, alcohol next, marijuana last with ZERO DEATHS
@dick_nixon Don’t let him off the floor, sir
@nataliejohnsonn @TCleveland4Real What does it say about the character of those who supported #CrookedHillary ?  Why do you think @realDonaldTrump won?  Soul searching in order for @TCleveland4Real
@nataliejohnsonn My sentiments exactly!
@washingtonpost Think that’s unique to @realDonaldTrump ?  The Democrats nominated the most corrupt candidate in history. Talk about blind loyalty...
@JoeNBC You mean like @HillaryClinton did? Reset button? Ukraine? Uranium One?
@JoeNBC Are you a crybaby? Why are you so afraid of the Russians? They’ve been interfering in our elections for 100 years and we’ve return the compliment. Walk it off, nothing to see
@MsAvaArmstrong That might be the stupidest thing you’ve ever said
@_celia_bedelia_ Nostalgia
@Acosta It did not happen in a vacuum. Dishonest reporting has consequences
@BillKristol Hopefully Democrats will understand when you run a corrupt candidate you open the door for a larger disaster. They brought this upon themselves and the rest of us
@brianschatz Don’t forget LGBT!
@JoeNBC That should make @HillaryClinton a prime target
@marklutchman @Momatree48 I used to sell ostrich jackets. Ranchers liked them, too. What’s wrong with liking expensive clothes?  Lots of American jobs depend on it. If your wife doesn’t need lots of shoes, your job is in jeopardy
@dick_nixon Even the vicuña topcoat had an understated elegance
@JeffreyGuterman @jaketapper Probably just a jacket unless the pants were double lined 🤣
@KamalaHarris Your hot air isn’t helping
@HouseGOP @RepMcKinley But you continue to jail people for marijuana use, something proven to reduce opioid use with no negative side effects. @PeteSessions blocks all bills in his committee. You are liars and hypocrites
@mmfa What is the difference between the “best and brightest” whose grandkids become derelicts or some ‘guy’s uncle from Zimbabwe’ whose grandkids become doctors?  You simply can’t know. That’s the flaw in your thinking. Most of our prosperity comes from the offspring of simple people
@TexasGOPVote @PeteSessions I am a long-time Republican supporter and have given over six figures to dozens of candidates over 4 decades . I am working to defeat @PeteSessions. He is wrong for Texas
@Houston_Hammer @TexasGOPVote @PeteSessions Then why is @PeteSessions blocking ALL reforms on marijuana laws? There are clear medical uses and millions of Americans want the CHOICE. HE WON’T LET THE BILLS OUT OF HIS COMMITTEE. DEFEAT THIS HYPOCRITE
@ananavarro And you obviously didn’t care enough to run an honest person against @realDonaldTrump to keep him from winning, so you might care a little more next time #CrookedHillary #hoistedonyourownpetard
@irwintanya @dizzyeyes You’ve clearly never heard of @momentous   Check it out
@dick_nixon The Presidency was best when it had mystique
I don’t know but you’re having trouble hiding your banality https://t.co/8jmDUN3I1E
@Zistar01 @animemoto And by ‘cuts’ you mean ‘reductions in the rate of increased spending’ hence an increase not cuts. How about just print the numbers?
His job is the same as yours.   One is heads and one is tails, two sides of the same coin. https://t.co/lcZHOlW51J
@krassenstein @OttawaEngineer Do the math again
@GovMikeHuckabee @TBN Truthfully you were doing more damage than marijuana smokers who actually do get jailed for it
@JeffreyGuterman That’s how my freshman physics professor described his circa 1970🤣
What kind of idiot wrote this article? #24 Gozzer Ranch doesn’t have a locker room in spite of being a 12-year old club. No showers, no lockers,... https://t.co/TmNAmyNAK5
@KamalaHarris So you’re in favor of subsidizing rich landlords, especially those in NY and LA and SF, further widening the equity gap?  How does that help renters other than temporarily snare them some better digs?
@PrisonPlanet @Jane85413347 I see a bunch of happy, peaceful boys and young men. Hard to see how this is a problem
@RadicalRuss It’s racist pure and simple
@SenKamalaHarris Then cut their taxes even more.
@JoeNBC You and @morningmika are prime examples of this
@costareports She’s an idiot limited to tweeting bromides and patent lies. If she is the 2020 nominee @realDonaldTrump will win 47 states
@JoeNBC It’s called ‘good cop, bad cop’
@ananavarro Or possibly you just don’t understand his tactics. Like Obama, he has the right to conduct foreign policy with a reasonable amount of national unity. You either have no faith in 242 years of democracy or you are seeking popularity in social media for financial gain
@BillKristol Yes, it is. I remember before @BillKristol caught #TrumpDerangementSyndrome he would have agreed
For the same reason, voters won’t hold ⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩ accountable until ⁦@HillaryClinton⁩ is held accountable  https://t.co/O0n4sFvDhT
Been saying this for two years. We have ⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩ BECAUSE the choice was Crook vs Clown. Clown won https://t.co/O0n4sFvDhT
Tricky Dick Schumer prostrates himself worse than a $5 hooker to pay obeisance to rank partisanship. The taste it leaves in his mouth must be similar... https://t.co/rNkkTFQgLN
@KamalaHarris Yawn
@SomRationalist @JeffreyGuterman @SachaBaronCohen @realDonaldTrump vs @HillaryClinton says it all
@JeffreyGuterman @SachaBaronCohen Any more questions about how we ended up with @realDonaldTrump vs @HillaryClinton ?  Uneducated, banal voters with no personal standards
@MSNBC The best civic lesson kids could learn is if we #LockHerUp
@KamalaHarris This is exactly what is wrong with socialism. The issue is not high rent but a dollar that is made worthless by government spending. Inflation is the enemy not the landlord
@washingtonpost Then, by all means, thank God for the Russians!  If they saved us from #CrookedHillary maybe we can be friends
@DrDenaGrayson @realDonaldTrump Then you’ve been asleep at the wheel
@SenKamalaHarris A monkey could be trained to vote like you at the cost of a few bananas.
@RadicalRuss She’s and idiot. If jail is your answer for pot use then you are a racist and a child abuser
@TomKludt Bullshit walks
@freedom_moates You’ve never been to Spokane
@northwestraven1 @kimsuejenn @homemadeguitars @PhiNight @BillKristol All of you must have missed the Robert Bork hearings. A lowlife like Ted Kennedy denigrating and demonizing a non-political and moral judge who served his country with honor. That was the Fort Sumter of the political war we now see ingrained in our culture
@BillKristol And when do you think that began?  @realDonaldTrump didn’t start it he’s the result of it. Only by running the most corrupt candidate in history did the Democrats create conditions for lightning to strike. #CrookedHillary
@illbegotdamn @nathtyputhy @MaryKeithBare1 @mimi_aunt @ECMcLaughlin Truly good Democrats wouldn’t have nominated #CrookedHillary in the first place
@KamalaHarris For similar reasons no one should pay more than 30% of their income in taxes
@SethAbramson You want your son to die for Montenegro be my guest
@AngelLight2U @grizzlemeister What happened to “You didn’t earn that”?  We built the office of President to be the most prestigious and all Obama income should be taxed at 90%
@tolovana66 @DMashak @GOP @TheDemocrats @realDonaldTrump And if everyone could spell
Partially explains why the Cleveland Police murdered #TamirRice and got away with it.  https://t.co/yzraB0p8kg
@DavidAFrench @JoeNBC Detestable as it was, it was consistent with @realDonaldTrump policy of punching back at #MSM ‘s relentless attempts to tie him to election misdeeds with Russia. He can do no less. Why expect a different response?
@ElderLansing @susan_z_kat How about #TamirRice ?
@JConabicycle @nypost With your decidedly Un-Jesus like standard we would have a 40% unemployment rate
@JConabicycle Hillary should apologize to us. She’s the only candidate that @realDonaldTrump could have beaten
@tribelaw This is the most irresponsible dribble I’ve read. Isolating him will do nothing to shorten his time in office. For all of your fear mongering, I have yet to understand what damage has been done by the Russians. If they got rid of Hillary, I would offer them a part in NATO!
RT @momentous: Social emotional health matters. 		#MondayMotivation https://t.co/tp4vKqAbms
@tribelaw He invaded the Ukraine and the Crimea on Obama’s watch. Can you please retweet your comments from that period?
@BJSymons Chileno Bay
@TrajanGregory @txgt @JohnCornyn @FBI Frankly, if Putin was responsible for Hillary’s defeat I personally think he did us a favor and himself a disservice. He conquered two countries under Obama. Let’s see how he does under @realDonaldTrump
@TrajanGregory @txgt @JohnCornyn @FBI They did investigate and found nothing. Now Mueller has been investigating and let’s see what he has. I can bet you if he had something he would’ve played it by now.
@BillKristol Like the DNC was all Hillary and before that all Obama. Yawn
@TrajanGregory @txgt @JohnCornyn It was theDNC that was hacked. You think Cornyn had access?  The DNC hid the servers from @FBI
@JoeNBC Not hard to understand at all. You two romanticized Trump and he gave you the brown helmet.  Your #TrumpDerangementSyndrome has gotten so bad that you’re both reduced to eight-year-old bathroom humor
@txgt @JohnCornyn It was Obama’s job to stop and sanction Russia not Cornyn’s.
@JohnCornyn In any presidential election Russia is going to have a preference and be rooting for about half of the voters. Not sure why this should have caught @CIA and @FBI so flat footed. Now it’s clear that they simply failed to do their jobs. Millions of us think Russia did us a favor
@JohnCornyn Not to mention they would make fools of themselves when the voters see how trite all this is
@perlmutations That’s why you’re a has been actor and he’s president
@BillKristol Gosar the Gosarian?
@kylegriffin1 Gotta love Louis!
@rebeccaballhaus China closet meet bull
@JoeNBC No, I think he’s just an equal opportunity insulter
@NicholsUprising @Scotus I remember him. The American people were denied one of the brightest legal minds of the 20th century and we got Thomas and Souter instead. Also changed the culture so we now have character assassination in lieu of hearings that enlighten the public
@RoKhanna The dishonest campaign to torpedo Bork is precisely why @realDonaldTrump is going to ram three or four conservative judges redone your throat
@PizzaGateLibya @BillKristol @FBI A good message the government finally gets it that @FBI needs restructuring is when they take J. Edgar Hoover’s name off my justice building.
@kylegriffin1 I get it
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump So is undermining a duly elected president. Democrats daily barrage is exactly what Putin wants
@BillKristol You should be a lot more concerned about how the @fbi treated Gen. Flynn
@GroovinJohn @Bob41Dylan Got that scheduled for my funeral
@Bob41Dylan Up To Me
@TexasTechFB Is JaMarcus Washington going to get some playing time this year?
@bevbmeares @JohnCornyn Warren Hatch?  At least he still knows his name
@JohnCornyn As we say in Texas, it don’t take long to look at a horseshoe. Make this quick.
@vpspirotagnew68 @ananavarro Clearly a nattering nabob of negativity
@BillKristol And they were never held accountable. It seems why some people are resigned to letting Trump be Trump. Why make him the first?  The Dems made the rules. Same for how we pick SCOTUS candidates. Bork hearings changed the rules
@SenSanders Your credibility is in shambles and this has such a hollow ring. Don’t anticipate this will last long
@SethAbramson We could do a lot worse. How can those lamenting Kennedy’s departure object if he blessed his replacement?  They prefer @realDonaldTrump has an unfettered pick?
@ScottGreenfield I will be the nominee before she will.
@SenFeinstein You hold not the House nor the Senate nor the White House. Sounds like it’s YOUR views on the subjects that are far out of the mainstream
@rolotomasi777 @BillKristol @realDonaldTrump Definitely disappointed in @BillKristol   He was never as wise as his father
@larryelder It’s sweet revenge having @realDonaldTrump pick Hillary’s judges. This is for you Bork. At least Mary Ellen is around to see it
@BillKristol In one way, having @realDonaldTrump pick what should have been Hillary’s judges, is perfect justice for what they did to Bork. He taught Bill and Hillary at Yale and knew their true colors
@KamalaHarris Shocking!
@CletisTStump @GovGaryJohnson @DrJillStein @SenSanders @HillaryClinton So, we had to accept Crooked over Clown?  No thanks
@rolotomasi777 @KamalaHarris It’s sad she claims to care about her constituents yet wastes her audience and opportunity with nothing more than bromides. I challenge her each time to offer a solution and it’s  🦗 🦗🦗🦗
@splashy79 @KaraCalavera @notcapnamerica You just explained why @realDonaldTrump won. The demographic that put him over in MI WI OH FL had seen a trail of dishonesty from Cattlegate to Obscene speaking fees to Russian Uranium. Those nominating her didn’t. Biden would have beaten him
@JohnCornyn Our drug laws should match that claim.
@michellebkinder Precisely!
@KamalaHarris Surely someone with this much conviction has a plan to suggest. Where might I find yours?
@notcapnamerica @KaraCalavera Not more liberal, more honest
@JohnCornyn They’ve had this coming since the Bork hearings. Make short work of this.
@davidaxelrod Sadly, it’s still better than the deal Obama made on Iran
@DennisDMZ Been saying this a long time. Thank you!  Want the origin of character assassination to fight presidential appointments? Look no further
@PearlsFromMyrna They’re extremely difficult to wear when you have a short torso
@JoeNBC @morningmika I did but you didn’t. You normalized @realDonaldTrump and flattered him when he came on your show and helped your ratings. Now you disavow him. How about an apology?  How about taking some responsibility?
@snuka_superfly @FilmBuff470 @freedom_moates Wild Bill Donovan himself warned FDR

@almostjingo @TheDemocrats @EPAScottPruitt @realDonaldTrump @TheJusticeDept It’s possible to find a competent administrator that doesn’t focus on maxing out the perks. This guy was so tone deaf I don’t see how he was ever elected to office.
@AlanDersh @OfficeOfMike @Morning_Joe @morningmika Considering their IQ’s added together don’t equal yours I seriously doubt it
This is profound https://t.co/VnFKzkrNvL
@SteveSchmidtSES Is he related to that preacher needing the $40 million jet?
@BillKristol Translation: “I didn’t know grifting for myself and the little women would be such a problem “
@BillKristol Good riddance to that idiot
@funder Since you brought it up...
@SenFeinstein Uh, that’s called democracy
@BillKristol Hell Clinton was elected president!  Rules went out the door forever in 1992
@avanconia Weekend with Ruth?
@avanconia It would make it harder to hide corruption therefore be a real deterrent
@HillaryClinton And you set us back 25 years. But you finally got the money you’ve so cravenly sought so I hope it was worth being a national laughing stock
@avanconia We should use Blockchain to secure government records
@CBDivaHealth Sadly because of a long line of idiots like @jeffsessions hundreds of thousands of minorities are ‘toughing it out’ in prison. Continued jailing of marijuana users is nothing less than racism and child abuse. User’s family and community suffer alongside. @realDonaldTrump can fix
@perlmutations A gorilla vs an orangutan
@funder @realDonaldTrump And you’re an attention seeking buffoon.                                         Happy July 4 to everyone else 🇺🇸
@ScottHech I’ve always said we may be the greatest country in history but we’re a long way from being a great country.

@SecOfState70 @Bre63068675Judy But if you’re feeling good about the American voter remember 126 million voted for a Crook or a Clown. The rest for a dope-smoker and a socialist. Maybe the non-voters were the good guys this time

@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Ted Kennedy pulled that during the Robert Bork hearings and while he thought it worked it merely destroyed a non-partisan process that has become so politicized all tactics are fair game. #Hoistedbyyourownpetard
@KamalaHarris Since you will be speaking for millions of Californians please answer one question: Is there anytime in the gestation period that the fetus acquires the rights of a citizen? I cannot get anyone who will actually vote on it to take a stand. Will you?
@HNSeal2 @washingtonpost I was talking about Bork. Read the thread
@DennisDMZ But they have handled it as well as can be expected
@tribelaw A lot of people thought that when Obama won but it didn’t turn out to be the case. We are still a stronger nation than any one man or movement and this too shall pass. Next time don’t force the most corrupt candidate in history on the voters! Now say you’re sorry.
@lauferlaw I don’t want politicians or former prosecutors as Supreme Court judges. Neither have the judgment for it.
@JoeNBC Sadly, due to its own fault, @realDonaldTrump has more credibility than @washingtonpost
@tribelaw In your legal opinion, is there any point at which the fetus gains the right to life as a citizen?  You owe us that answer
@JohnCornyn What they mean is the Dems were hoisted on their own petard
@tribelaw Pretty funny coming from an embittered SCOTUS wannabe
@KamalaHarris Here we go again. Sit back and enjoy the revenge of Robert Bork You earned it
@JohnCornyn Actually I think the Founding Fathers weaponized it.
@HNSeal2 @washingtonpost Read your history. His hearings are why we have such a lousy process. Joe Biden started it!  So did that drunk phone Ted Kennedy

The savaging of Robert Bork destroyed trust in the Judicial Committee’s charge to put America’s interests over the party’s. The free-for-all gave us what passes now for process and reduces quality
@MrDane1982 @ooshdesign What about those of us too honest to vote for #CrookedHillary ?
@KamalaHarris The people did have a say in it and they elected @realDonaldTrump
@esaagar The ‘black sites’ comment was improper but she is right that the structure of ICE (and the @FBI @CIA , DEA for that matter) has an extrajudicial element that needs addressing and correcting for they are clear threats to Liberty

@lauferlaw Traitorous?  How so?
@davidaxelrod @SenMajLdr And after what Joe Biden, et al did to Robert Bork it was long overdue payback.
@KamalaHarris Wouldn’t it be easier to move to Sweden?
@Cernovich Is it now your job to hunt down and identify every idiot that says something stupid?  Is this your purpose on social media?
@GaryCMeleJr It wasn’t Obama that brought gay marriage. He fought it until it was inevitable and then, like #CrookedHillary he embraced it. The Supreme Court changed it not the cowards we elect to assure our rights

@RealJamesWoods @HorriganWill Desperation had a stench all its own
https://t.co/YmQkwB4yte.                              In 1972 US went from metal based currency to fiat money. It set off a slow burn in the purchasing power of the dollar that robbed the middle class like the frog boiling in water. Deficits matter.

@LindseyGrahamSC @Satch7Eddie It’s going to be nearly impossible to hold @realDonaldTrump accountable until we hold @HillaryClinton accountable. Call it accountability fatigue
@Bmac0507 I’m going to have to insist on open carry
@Jim_D77 @GovLarryHogan No but we should align our immigration policy with the laws of Nature. Here are two: Labor follows Capital. Unfree people seek freedom. Ignoring that caused the ‘gap’ to be labeled “illegal”. Let ‘em in but use technology to track them and require ongoing assimilation to remain.
@kathygriffin From where I sit, they are all doing better than you. Jealousy is not flattering on anyone but on you it adds the pathetic element. You’d think by now you would learn vulgarity lost its shock value and makes you look desperate.

@independentopi2 @writerkellymcv @Nebul0us1 @JoeNBC @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump The ‘red line’ in Syria was huge and the Iranian deal was a fraud. That’s only two of many and hardly a partisan view. I didn’t dislike Obama nor did I want him to fail. I didn’t vote for Trump but I don’t want him to fall either
@independentopi2 @writerkellymcv @Nebul0us1 @JoeNBC @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump Well, the conversation was about Trump’s damage to our foreign image vs. previous presidents. That kinda includes Obama
@writerkellymcv @Nebul0us1 @JoeNBC @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump is no worse than Obama just in a different way. If he negotiates better trade terms, it proves why guys like Joe are clueless opportunists. Joe has to sell TV ads in an ever more competitive world, alas, at the expense of his integrity

@MSNBC @HardballChris 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Chris, you’re really going to offer advice to @realDonaldTrump on North Korea?  You think reading talking points make you smart?
@krauthammer thanks for your meaningful, sane and erudite contributions to our political discourse.  Prayers for your family

@paulajean2018 @BrandNew535 @WVUforPaulaJean @WVWorkingFams @RiseUpWV @rustywilliams00 @cannabisnewsnet @WVcannabis @MedicalWv @VoteToLegalize @legalize Can you please find out if the pharmacist in Kermit that sold 9 million pills has been arrested. Seems to me an obvious criminal
@TheMossadIL @JackPosobiec You just stole something from them much more valuable than that! In fact, they’d give you the money if they can have their nuclear research back. No questions asked.
@FLOTUS I don’t think anyone in America has a more difficult job than you: married to a lightening rod and compelled into the daily spotlight at the mercy of howling buffoons. Yet you do it with grace and dignity. Hope that rubs off on your detractors
@DiscoPotential @davidaxelrod His guilt notwithstanding, social media in the hands of the uneducated and easily swayed is little more than a means to put the pitchforks and torches together into an unmanageable mob
@DoGoodforOthers @BGTX @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton That may well turn out to be the case and if so he should pay, too but her crimes are known. What she did with her emails was inexcusable. Thanks for the civil discourse. Getting rarer online
@tribelaw @PreetBharara Why another tainted abuser of power?  Any reason not to pick someone with unquestionable integrity?
@dmartosko Isn’t that the underlying promise of Twitter?
@AriFleischer Can anyone get that through @JohnCornyn ‘s stubborn head?
@txraised78 @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC Read the statute and decide for yourself. It’s clear to me
@txraised78 @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC Comey admitted she did something illegal. He then proceeded to declare her innocent of bad faith, which is irrelevant to the criminal statute and got Comey fired. Does that register with you?
@shikari @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC This is Texas, pal, we’re busy with things that matter. I get that those long cold Minnesota winter/spring can get you a little riled up
@txraised78 @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC Back who? Trump?  Never said I support him and didn’t vote for him. Why does holding Hillary accountable imply I excuse ANY violations of the law?  We have plenty of jail space
@EverWitch @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC So let them all go free?  Think Trump won’t abuse that standard?
@toml1777 @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC You trust her more than your accountant and your banker. Bush was different time and rules. And I am not excusing anyone. Just saying she has gotten away with it so far
@bhodisvaha @FoxNews @GovernorSununu @JohnKerry Funny thing is that tweet got me blocked by @matthewjdowd !  I fail to see the controversy
@txraised78 @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC You’re embarrassing yourself and all of Texas with such shallow comments
@EverWitch @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC My grandson uses that excuse:”He did it first “
@sea_hag1961 @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC I don’t know what planet you live on but nothing I said excused Trump for his behavior.
@1grn_eyez @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC I didn’t vote for Trump and will let his actions stand alone
@SJerzGirl @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC Comey gave her an undeserved pass. Obviously you and a ton of her followers on these tweets have too. It is what it is. We have the government we deserve
@shikari @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC You sound like a Clinton sycophant who is just fine with their behavior so long as they match your politics. That is how we ended up with Trump. Keep it up
@ellebycul @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC @realDonaldTrump Where did anyone say that?
@swalters5 @ltdnorg @TruthTeamOne @amm32flavors @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC If you read before reacting you would find no one was excused. I’m asking you to hold all of them to a higher standard
@shikari @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC But they did, and Comey squelched it with help from Peter Strozk
@RussKlettke @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC Comey, Obama, Lynch were all that was needed
@shikari @amm32flavors @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC When you twist them so they fit your agenda, yes indeed
@jamlxw @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC They were not allowed to keep a private server which surely you know if you read in any depth. The whole purpose was not “convenience” but to control what was shared. The people own the information not HRC
@LaurelDallyn @brooksidemb @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC And therein lies the problem. You and millions like you think Hillary has integrity. Millions more think Trump has integrity. I think neither has it. It’s on us to be discerning enough voters to nominate people who actually have it. In 2016 America failed
@DoGoodforOthers @BGTX Thanks for your service. As an Army vet you know well you would be in the brig had you done what Hillary did. Truth matters,  soldier
@GolfSoBad @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC I hope you don’t teach your students to always trust the FBI, as MLK, JFK, those dead kids in Waco, Ruby Ridge just to name a few might attest. If you work for the Feds and sign a document to retain emails and delete them, yes, you should be investigated
@MacPheeMichele @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC That’s all I’ve been saying for two hours. Everyone read this as a defense of Trump
@janet444 @Ornery_Opinions @patricklee6669 @Hyperguyver @amm32flavors @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC When Korea has nukes, Russia is in the Crimea and Ukraine and we are trillions in debt, yes, nonsense. “Mean-spiritness”!? That is the definition of nonsense. We’re done here.

@LexKuhne @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC Because she managed to screw up the perfect opportunity
@LeoKapakosNY @UnimpressedTX @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC Then you know exactly how I feel about crooked Hillary
@grayarea636 @amm32flavors @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC If you want to justify bad governance by comparing Trump to Clinton it’s a race to the bottom.  No thanks. Holding Hillary accountable is unrelated to anything Donald Trump is doing
@LeoKapakosNY @UnimpressedTX @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC You have to admit there were plenty of law-enforcement agencies authorized to deal with Trump’s private life. If there was something there, they would’ve found it. He had plenty of enemies and lots of time in court
@ByrneMom FIFO is my preference but I’m not picky. I didn’t vote for Trump but don’t think those who did are surprised by the seediness of his personal and business life. They wanted and got a bull in the China closet
@LeoKapakosNY @UnimpressedTX @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC Your standards are below those of the law. It’s nice to be a generous person
@UnimpressedTX @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC A form of government employees sign when they except the job. I can get the number it is that important.
@Tj37043 @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC Trump should have to preserve and turn over anything required of him by law. I can’t give Hillary a pass because you think Trump did something wrong. Otherwise no one could be held accountable. Where is your standard?
@SolarPhinn @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC Yes I’ll admit a particular disgust for Hillary because I’ve seen her get away with so much. I didn’t vote for Trump but I would have voted for the Taliban before voting for Hillary. He sucks but she would have been worse
@LeoKapakosNY @UnimpressedTX @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC So what?  He was in PRIVATE business and had no fiduciary to the public. She did when she signed the form agreeing to turn over her communications. If Trump broke laws over the past decades there were authorities in place to deal with it
@LaurelDallyn @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC Where in my hundreds of tweets do you see support for Trump?  Nowhere. I didn’t vote for the Orange One or the Crooked One. Why do Hillary supporters always use Trump as an excuse for her behavior?
@painter_nancy @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC She was given a lot of deference because she was a lawyer and a First Lady. No doubt she bent the rules and broke some along the way
@huskypackmom @VickiPadgett5 @LeightonDumas @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC Yet there he sits
@amm32flavors @janet444 @Ornery_Opinions @patricklee6669 @Hyperguyver @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC Well it survived two Clinton terms
@janet444 @Ornery_Opinions @patricklee6669 @Hyperguyver @amm32flavors @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC He won doing it his way. He will win 44 states in 2020.  We’ll see how your focus on nonsense works out
@janet444 @Ornery_Opinions @patricklee6669 @Hyperguyver @amm32flavors @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC I think Clinton taking advantage of an intern while holding the highest office in the land while Hillary protected him set a low standard that Trump appears to be trying to match but isn’t there yet
@gjn_27 @MuushusPork @LeightonDumas @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC 0 indictments do far. Comey rigged the game which by now should be obvious to anyone but rank partisans
@SolarPhinn @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC Bobby, where do you see me praising or even excusing Trump?  Can we not hold all public officials to a higher standard?  How about we just start with getting them to follow the law?  I’ll settle for that
@huskypackmom @VickiPadgett5 @LeightonDumas @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC I think it’s lost on Hillary’s supporters that running such a crooked candidate disturbed enough voters that Trump was the result. It was a bridge too far for millions. 58,000 of them spread over three states made the difference, not the Russians
@ydauterive @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC You read them. She signed a document saying she would turn them all over. She also spread them over 15 devices so you can’t give her carte blanc to decide which ones to keep. She is not that trustworthy and the law doesn’t give that discretion
@janet444 @Ornery_Opinions @patricklee6669 @Hyperguyver @amm32flavors @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC I happen to know that goes on a lot in government as a matter of practicality. It’s not right for Trump either. I didn’t vote for him (or her) but dislike the relentless push to destroy him. America doesn’t need that right now.
@TruthTeamOne @amm32flavors @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC So your standard of good governance is “the other guy did it”?  Good luck to you.
@zphreaky @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC And I would think the steelworkers in Pittsburgh and the auto workers in Michigan would also disagree with your assertion they were fooled by the Russians into voting for @realDonaldTrump instead of #CrookedHillary
@UnimpressedTX @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC The Trumps are hillbillies with money and certainly ethically challenged. Any footsie they are playing with the Russians is small time and will be revealed. It is nothing like Hillary’s clear cut violation of an agreement put there for just that reason
@mgobluegirl6 @markle_darla @JudyE2018 @amm32flavors @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC Anyone who accepted Hillary’s right to choose which emails to delete and which ones to turn over, regardless of signing a document to the contrary, is willing to accept corrupt government so long as they are of your political persuasion. Own it
@Ornery_Opinions @patricklee6669 @Hyperguyver @amm32flavors @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC None of that is the point. She signed an agreement under penalty of perjury and that she would turn over all of her emails upon leaving office.
@weedyfunk @Ornery_Opinions @patricklee6669 @Hyperguyver @amm32flavors @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC Tell that to the military personnel that are in prison for much less
@PeteLRodriguez @CBuettner627 @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC It the law of the land is just “a tired old theory” nothing I say is going to make sense.    Good luck
@LeightonDumas @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC The evidence is there, but there is no will to enforce the law. She’s not the first nor the last to get away with it. Rather than take sides left or right we should be united in holding all officials accountable, including Trump, Hillary and half of Congress
@ACMESalesRep @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC The game is rigged. Not always against Republicans, it depends on the flow of power, just speaking of how different Hillary and Trump are being treated by the same FBI
@AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC Reorder the tinfoil
@PeteLRodriguez @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC Lawyers have certain obligations plus she SIGNED A DOCUMENT UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY saying she would not
@PeteLRodriguez @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC Little fish. Flynn is an American hero who dedicated his life to protecting his country and you seem so willing to call him a traitor.  Manafort likely committed tax fraud which is unrelated to Trump
@PeteLRodriguez @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC It is also a crime for an attorney to delete an email that they think might be useful later. That’s a different standard
@PeteLRodriguez @AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC No, If even one of them was secret, it’s irrelevant. She had no legal authority to make that decision on her own. Would you trust Donald Trump to decide which 33,000 emails he wants to delete? I don’t
@plainandy @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC Well a good start is the deletion of 33,000 emails. If your standards are so low this doesn’t bother you there’s not much to discuss
@AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC And all those indictments were Russians!  What does that tell you?  He is fishing to justify the witch hunt
@AshleyKjonaas @matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC If you think deleting 33,000 emails was legal and not a scandal you have very low standards for what passes as honest governance. America won’t be great until justice applies to all.
@matthewjdowd @ThisWeekABC Which tells me the game is rigged against Republicans. Hillary is guilty as they come

@Azillion If you think this all came about in the twelve months of @realDonaldTrump you missed two Clinton terms where this behavior was dismissed as “just sex”, plus 8 years each of Bush and Obama where the political discourse degraded further
@Azillion One of those smart generals once said “Don’t interfere with your enemy when he is destroying himself “.   Michelle Wolf and her defenders lead the way
@Azillion Why use his indecency to justify using it against others?  It was a bit of future telling but to make a point that this only enrages his base and discourages independents from supporting his opponent.
@Azillion Where does it say I am a Trump supporter?  Is a plea for decency partisan?  I have a high sensitivity to haters of all stripes and it’s tough being an American who can debate facts in the Twitter world

@darrell_harri @michelemccarrol @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump I don’t support him either but it has NOTHING TO DO WITH showing decency. You’re either in the gutter with them or not
@matthewjdowd So you are telling your followers that Michelle Wolf’s vulgar rant is just a fair political response to an elected president?  What happened to your sense of decency? You have become just one more usually rational person unhinged by @realDonaldTrump
@krassenstein There is (or used to be) such a thing as common decency. Hollywood has made sure to destroy it. It was not a roast but a vulgar rant by the left and that is why @realDonaldTrump won and why he will win 44 states in 2020

@glkitty That’s a good description of someone who thought Hillary was a good candidate for President.
@glkitty Bernie would have never gotten anything passed and would have gone away after one term so, yes, I would have voted for him because of his honesty. I can handle four years of gridlock
@dick_nixon I know there are many things about him that make you shudder but you have to like his crude candor in dealing with the media
@glkitty @76cjl @CharlesMBlow You claim to be a wordsmith! Ha!
@glkitty @76cjl @CharlesMBlow The all caps vulgarity generally indicates you’re out of ideas or intellect. Adios

@glkitty @76cjl @CharlesMBlow Yes
@StanleyCohenLaw It’s quite common in long close relationships. I’ve known 10-15 couples who died within days of each other including two that had joint funerals.
@glkitty @76cjl @CharlesMBlow I don’t like his politics but Bernie has integrity and I would have voted for him over Trump but I would have voted for the Taliban before voting for #CrookedHillary. It’s not partisan to say he won because she sucked. It’s a fact
@76cjl @CharlesMBlow BTW I didn’t vote for Trump. Given a choice between a Crook and a Clown I opted for the dope-smoking Gov of New Mexico. Both sides need an honest reassessment of values.
@76cjl @CharlesMBlow I think Sean Hannity is the right’s version of Lawrence O’Donnell. Both are self-promoting blowhards with no other accomplishments. Fox News has its flaws but is more diverse than CNN or MSNBC

@matthewjdowd Wouldn’t it be easier if we quit selling weapons to those who use them indiscriminately?
@MuslimIQ Yet just a fraction of the deaths of Syrians caused by 40 years of the murdering Assads
@KevorkAlmassian They don’t deserve two generations of the genocidal murdering Assads
@DEAHQ @NIDAnews Here’s the only relevant question: Are we better off if the 7% of Americans that use marijuana are put in prison?  If the answer is ‘no’, there is no other course than legalization. Trust Americans to make judgments for themselves
@matthewjdowd The pardon of Marc Rich was outrageous. Scooter was a political victim who wasn’t even the one who revealed Valerie Plame’s name.  The real leaker escaped punishment

@BillKristol Raiding the office of @realDonaldTrump ‘s lawyer over Stormy Daniels vs. giving #CrookedHillary a pass after deleting 33000 email AFTER RECEIVING A SUBPOENA. Why were you silent during this transgression?
@SoManyPplRSayin @jonfavs Go back and study your history. It happened before Gingrich
@SoManyPplRSayin @jonfavs No, that honor belongs to Ted Kennedy the woman killer who demonized the irreproachable Robert Bork
@dick_nixon @SpeakerBoehner There were moments in the White House, sir, where you would’ve been better off with the herb than the whiskey. The young people knew more than we understood
@benabyad Because it is a regular occurring event and no one is surprised. We have a double standard for who gets to kill innocent people with impunity. Just our friends!
@matthewjdowd The responsibility belongs to the Media and they have failed us spectacularly
@billpostmus Big Brother. Scary
@nytopinion If you had said that about @BillClinton in 1992 or @HillaryClinton in 2008 we wouldn’t be having this conversation today about @realDonaldTrump. Media capitulation isn’t without consequences
@ThomasWictor That Assad’s protection is necessary to preserve Christians presence in Syria is the definition of a Faustian bargain.
@sevatividam23 @tribelaw @realDonaldTrump Considering Joe has done nothing and only runs BECAUSE he is a Kennedy the public needs a true view of the whole sick family

@RepTomEmmer Then it is your responsibility to educate yourself on medical marijuana which has ZERO deaths per day and is PROVEN effective for many ailments. It’s not a panacea but Congress’ willful ignorance has to end. Can you truly lead?
@tribelaw @RNicholasBurns We let his old man get away with killing 30,000 in Hama in 1982. Junior just laughs as Vogue features his wife while he gasses his people and obliterates an ancient land. The West failed Syria.
@tribelaw Wow. Your hatred of @realDonaldTrump now has you defending Teddy killing Mary Jo and ABANDONING HER TO DIE ALONE IN THE WATER. I wondered how low you might go but this surprises me

@RitaLiLz @dantoujours @SBusinessDreams @lack_of_energy @maeaswell @Bedazzled007 @tedlieu @TuckerCarlson Then they should subsidize the tenant and they would achieve the same thing without reducing ongoing supply

@maeaswell @Bedazzled007 @tedlieu @TuckerCarlson It all boils down to land prices and taxes. Can’t solve one much less both.
@nytopinion @nytimes more than any other institution besides perhaps the @BostonGlobe was complicit in the cover up of Mary Jo’s needless death. Just like #CrookedHillary you do the opposite of what you preach
@nytopinion He never held a private job yet had an estate of $150 million (Any guess on how much tax he paid?). He left that girl to suffocate-so he was a coward, a hypocrite, a drunk and a liar

@TheDailyEdge @pamwallace So 241 years of greatness down the drain in just one year of @realDonaldTrump ?  Not much faith do you?
@TomMcKay7 Flavius Renatus
@GeorgeTakei @pamwallace I thought you welcomed that
@MsAvaArmstrong Thankee. As a Texan, I like to be accommodating and welcoming.  No immigrants came here paying their way really, they came here for opportunity and went to work earning a place. My grandfather was one of those dreaded Syrians.
@matthewjdowd Finally! Something in which we are in perfect agreement!  That will get you off my fighting side.
@BosscheMichel @MsAvaArmstrong With my west Texas twang, nearly all of them end up speaking better English than me!
@MsAvaArmstrong 95%+of illegal immigration comes from overstayed visas. Sneaking across is impossible to do with any meaningful possessions so it is mostly (not always) migrant workers who should have an easier path.
@real_vt16 @kaylerr_jane @Fuctupmind The better life gets the more it is taken for granted. Most of the immigrants I run across are lower income and very grateful to be here. I think the cultures that mistrust us are the ones that don’t assimilate out of stubbornness or resentment
@MsAvaArmstrong The big flaw is not requiring assimilation. I’d give an immigrant seeking to stay long or become a citizen five years to learn English or go home.
@MsAvaArmstrong We have borders, and not much improvement is needed. The wall rhetoric is for votes not conviction.  Trump hires these very people at his properties.  Until our immigration laws match reality it will remain broken.
@MsAvaArmstrong Uh, yes. Unless you want to be Italy or Japan
@GolfChannel A man of the people
@real_vt16 @kaylerr_jane @Fuctupmind We are in a global competition for capital. Labor, especially discounted labor is an asset. I view people as valuable capital
@real_vt16 @kaylerr_jane @Fuctupmind I grew up around lots of migrant farm workers and other hard labor jobs. These people were great contributors. Like our youth today, theirs have similar cultural dysfunction so it makes criminal activity stand out more. I don’t think immigrants are any worse
@real_vt16 @kaylerr_jane @Fuctupmind Yes but ironically it makes them more American 🤣

@RealJamesWoods You mean crawl through downtown Los Angeles
@real_vt16 @kaylerr_jane @Fuctupmind Not people. The card. Activate it remotely when visa expires so government knows who is overstaying their welcome. I am more trusting but for those who fear immigrants this would address one source of “illegal immigration”:expired visas
@kaylerr_jane @Fuctupmind I was good with his DACA bill. Dems should have jumped on it
@kaylerr_jane @Fuctupmind The main problem is our policy does not match the laws of supply and demand. We should be honest about our need for manual labor from foreign countries. We should make these people welcome to come and go so long as they obey the law
@kaylerr_jane @Fuctupmind Such a card could have paycheck loaded through it, taxes deducted, even a GPS chip for some. Get caught without it, you’re gone along with your family.
@kaylerr_jane @Fuctupmind Yes, but smart immigration policy is better than a wall. If Visa knows you’re not in Dallas buying a toaster and calls you, we can devise a system that keeps track of who is here and following the rules
@dick_nixon I always appreciated your service https://t.co/sgHRmLfaxr
@kaylerr_jane @Fuctupmind So why would we emulate these countries you mentioned? Immigrants are assets. It worked for 250 years

@WonderBitchToo @PageSix By your inability to make your points with anything but a profanity I assume this is your IQ
@WonderBitchToo @PageSix It’s not over by a long shot
@WonderBitchToo @PageSix It was NYPD’s investigation of Anthony Weiner that tipped Comey off to the Huma emails and forced him to send the letter that Hillary claimed did her in. Even Hillary agrees with me on this one
@WonderBitchToo @PageSix Listen to yourself. “Even if they did”. James Comey ANNOUNCED it when he pre-exonerated her in his congressional testimony. I get that you love #CrookedHillary but willful ignorance only affects you
@WonderBitchToo @PageSix Wow!  You better double up on the tin foil
@WonderBitchToo @PageSix Yet. Either way it doesn’t excuse it or make it legal. You want the same thing Trump diehards want: “It’s OK if my guy is doing it “
@DLoesch @instapundit Dang!
@WonderBitchToo @PageSix Who said they are?
@WonderBitchToo @PageSix They found a number of classified emails that she should’ve turned over. She sent them unprotected to Huma who shared with Weiner all of which are jailable offenses. Keep your eyes closed it’s working
@WonderBitchToo @PageSix Again, you missed the point. You don’t answer you only compare her to Trump. She was not allowed to do that. Colin Powell is an excuse she used. If you can’t answer me and only throw Trump in my face it says a lot about you
@WonderBitchToo @PageSix The foundation tax return. If you can explain what those expenses or four it would go along way to make your case, but the return itself shows I am right
@BroMark1611 @mike_Zollo @Golfinggary5221 If you can’t define why it’s a bad thing, it shouldn’t matter if he gets “worse”. It’s simply an accounting term and not indicative of financial health.
@_wintergirl93 Looks like a drive-by Ash Wednesday
@mike_Zollo @Golfinggary5221 OK Mike, now tell us why trade deficits are bad
@SenatorDurbin Are these anywhere for public review?
@WonderBitchToo @PageSix Do you think a secretary of state of the United States should have the right to bit-bleach her computers, delete 33,000 emails and completely disregard the rule of law? I don’t know five Hillary supporters that would except that from the Bush administration
@WonderBitchToo @PageSix No I was reduced to voting for a dope smoker in hopes the Libertarian Party got 5% of the national vote which puts them permanently in 50 ballots.  Was trying to do what Trump is doing but without Trump. Break the 2-party monopoly
@WonderBitchToo @PageSix Cattlegate?
@WonderBitchToo @PageSix I don’t like or defend Trump. That has nothing to do with Hillary being a crook
@WonderBitchToo @PageSix They don’t need to they sell access through speaking fees. Who makes $100 million working in government?  Just them and LBJ

@JohnBrennan @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean that they are not out to get you.
@JRubinBlogger But neither are 98% of Americans on this subject. Still waiting for someone to explain why trade deficits are bad.
@WonderBitchToo @PageSix I’m looking at the 2015 tax return (latest online) and it shows revenue of $118 million and expenses of $99 million. Grants of $3.7million. What am I missing?
@CNNPolitics Anyone who doesn’t think @realDonaldTrump out-crazying Kim Jung Un and tightening sanctions prompted this is missing the obvious
@BillKristol Bill, do you think @realDonaldTrump had anything to do with the two Koreas talking?
@TurtlesgaloreMR @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump He has plenty
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump I’m with you. But you gotta admit out-crazying Kim Jung Un moved the needle

@SmallGov4All @JRubinBlogger @realDonaldTrump @AFPhq @FreedomWorks @FoxBusiness @BreitbartNews Those are completely unrelated items. It’s American taxes paid minus government spending. You seem to resent that the American standard of living rises when we are able to buy more from countries than they can afford from us

@SmallGov4All @JRubinBlogger @realDonaldTrump @AFPhq @FreedomWorks @FoxBusiness @BreitbartNews I agree wages suck. The cause is fiat money and government policies.  When we spend more than we make we erode purchasing power of the dollar. Harming trade will make it worse

@rabiasquared @instapundit #CrookedHillary and @realDonaldTrump ?
@rolotomasi777 @mseunice46 @BillKristol You might also note the one year we had near parity with foreign steel was 2009 at the depth of the financial crisis. Cheaper natural resources benefit American consumers
@rolotomasi777 @mseunice46 @BillKristol We import steel from 110 countries and China is not even in the top 10. You could ban Chinese steel and not move the needle
@rolotomasi777 @mseunice46 @BillKristol The fact you have all day to be on your smartphone says you’re doing okay. Incomes are record levels and employment high. Poor people have significant safety net.  Free Trade did much of it
@rolotomasi777 American exceptionalism is nonsense designed to justify our meddling in the world. We’re a long way from the noble cause of WW2and mostly do what we now accuse Russia of
@rolotomasi777 1. I’m older than you 2. I never said everything Trump does here is wrong because we have some inequalities in trade but in general it is just govt. picking winners and losers again. That helps 1%
@rolotomasi777 @mseunice46 @BillKristol The Chinese man owns it but we don’t count it as reciprocal spending when we calculate “trade deficits”. Hence the number means nothing
@rolotomasi777 “Perhaps he had an epiphany”!  That’s rich. Tariffs hurt consumers. Trump knows that. He bought Chinese steel when it suited him and taxes others when it doesn’t. It will end up costing American jobs elsewhere
@rolotomasi777 @BillKristol You should take an economics class
@TheTylt He could probably beat Stevie Wonder in boxing
@rolotomasi777 @BillKristol All they do is hurt Chinese consumers
@mseunice46 @rolotomasi777 @BillKristol Thank you!  The point I was trying to make
@rolotomasi777 @BillKristol American car buyers benefit from cheaper cars. Simple like you say. Trump built ALL of his buildings with the cheapest steel he could find. Tariffs hurt way more American consumers than it helps steel workers
@rolotomasi777 @BillKristol Here’s one: Chinese guy sells $2million worth of chopsticks to Panda Express then travels to NY and buys a $5million condo. We count that as a$2m trade deficit!
@rolotomasi777 @BillKristol Mine wasn’t political. Bill can’t tell me, Trump can’t and apparently you can’t. We don’t have great imbalance and nothing close to 800-1 possible exception a few small poor countries that have nothing to sell us
@rolotomasi777 @BillKristol Nothing I said was related to Trump’s actions. It was an academic question but you seem more interested in obfuscation
@rolotomasi777 @BillKristol Sometimes, Michael, it’s better to be thought a fool than open your mouth and remove all doubt. You clearly have no idea what a trade deficit means.  But few do so no worries
@anildash @Carnage4Life @NYPDnews Obviously not. Read a few tweets and be enlightened
@rolotomasi777 @BillKristol What does that have to do with trade deficits?
@rolotomasi777 @BillKristol 1. It only happens in a wealthy country.                                                         2.  Its merely an accounting feature and doesn’t tell us anything about economic health.3. By rule it is balanced by capital accounts.   Now, your turn
@RepStevenSmith @realDonaldTrump OK Steve. Explain why trade deficits are a bad thing
@JBPritzker @KennedyforIL The reality is we all need an escape. The fortunate ones manage it with religion. For some it’s booze or hard drugs or opioids or food or sex. Marijuana is the least harmful of most dependencies
@BillKristol Anyone care to try their hand at telling me why trade deficits are bad?
@JangoBear @dbongino It’s basically semi worthless paper. If they try to cash it in they destroy the value meanwhile we slowly inflated away the purchasing power. Would you trade 10 million washing machines for some notes? I would
@tombrokaw Says the guy that never signed a paycheck

@matthewjdowd Sad thing is it was the truth. It wasn’t Steele’s fault he couldn’t save the Republicans from themselves
@realDonaldTrump It would be helpful if you could explain why a trade deficit is a bad thing. I don’t think you can because they are mostly a good thing.
@brithume @instapundit He still has one foot left to shoot

@LomahMore @AriFleischer @RitaPanahi I’m just saying that hawkish is not the answer to the Middle East. We let our allies get away with things that we impose on our “enemies”. The Saudi’s are the devils that attacked us yet we gave them a pass
@LomahMore @AriFleischer @RitaPanahi What invasion?  If social media affected that many votes there something wrong with our voters. The fact that 126 million voted for a Crook or a Clown says it all

@LomahMore @AriFleischer @RitaPanahi She admitted it!
@LomahMore @AriFleischer @RitaPanahi I see it more as him defending himself from a relentless, biased media barrage accusing him of treason. I did not vote for him and I dislike his mannerisms, but out of a sense of fairness, he’s right to fight back. He received enough votes to win. Respect that

@SurlyGirl09 @TexasKimberley @chiles1129 @rorymkirkwood @JohnBrennan That’s how badly she sucks
@SurlyGirl09 @TexasKimberley @chiles1129 @rorymkirkwood @JohnBrennan As disgusting as Trump’s behavior is, everyone knew he was a philandering playboy.  It is far worse that she betrayed women by protecting her husband when she ran as a champion of women.
@SurlyGirl09 @TexasKimberley @chiles1129 @rorymkirkwood @JohnBrennan Once again, I did not vote for Trump so there’s no point flogging a dead horse. I’m saying we have Trump because the Democrats insisted on Hillary. That’s on them.
@SurlyGirl09 @TexasKimberley @chiles1129 @rorymkirkwood @JohnBrennan That all occurred before Trump got in the race. It’s bothersome, but only as a nuisance. With billions of tweets, do you think a few Russian bots really changed the outcome? No, Hillary lost it on her own
@SurlyGirl09 @TexasKimberley @chiles1129 @rorymkirkwood @JohnBrennan Those are unrelated. Criticism of #CrookedHillary doesn’t equal support for Trump. With her history of deceit, it is a certainty she obstructed justice. That should bother you
@SurlyGirl09 @TexasKimberley @chiles1129 @rorymkirkwood @JohnBrennan And if deleting 33,000 emails doesn’t bother you nothing else she did will either. I have a higher standard for politicians.
@SurlyGirl09 @TexasKimberley @chiles1129 @rorymkirkwood @JohnBrennan She has appalling judgment.  It is not a comparison to Trump who also has appalling judgment. Again, Hillary voters owe us an apology for Trump winning
@SurlyGirl09 @TexasKimberley @chiles1129 @rorymkirkwood @JohnBrennan Seems to me his voters wanted him to wreck the china shop and he is obliging them
@SurlyGirl09 @TexasKimberley @chiles1129 @rorymkirkwood @JohnBrennan I don’t have enough time to give you accurate research, but let me start with cattlegate, white water, travelgate, slut shaming of Bill’s victims, Rose Law records, Benghazi, Iraq, Russia reset, Clinton Foundation, Berniegate, 33,000 emails..
@SurlyGirl09 @TexasKimberley @chiles1129 @rorymkirkwood @JohnBrennan A combination of being lied to by the establishment, and the impotence of Congress in governing created its own critical mass.  Too many stayed in too long while he picked them off
@SurlyGirl09 @TexasKimberley @chiles1129 @rorymkirkwood @JohnBrennan No she is much too sinister to be open. Her world is the world of secrecy and that is the most dangerous
@SurlyGirl09 @TexasKimberley @chiles1129 @rorymkirkwood @JohnBrennan I think virtually any other Democrat would’ve beaten him including Bernie. I was just looking for integrity, and was left with Gary (what’s Aleppo) Johnson
@SurlyGirl09 @TexasKimberley @chiles1129 @rorymkirkwood @JohnBrennan I am not a Trump supporter and decline to defend him. Her record is the Disastrous Proof, including invading Iraq, Benghazi, enabling Bill, $100 million net worth, Uranium, etc. She has no judgment
@SurlyGirl09 @TexasKimberley @chiles1129 @rorymkirkwood @JohnBrennan We got a two-fer
@SurlyGirl09 @TexasKimberley @chiles1129 @rorymkirkwood @JohnBrennan Because she is corrupt at her core, and has given us over three decades of evidence.  The deletion of 33,000 emails was the final straw. I would’ve voted for the Taliban before Hillary
@chevonster @SurlyGirl09 @TexasKimberley @chiles1129 @rorymkirkwood @JohnBrennan Ha!  Clearly you’ve never been to west Texas
@SurlyGirl09 @TexasKimberley @chiles1129 @rorymkirkwood @JohnBrennan I think our collective complacency as voters may have finally woken us up
@SurlyGirl09 @TexasKimberley @chiles1129 @rorymkirkwood @JohnBrennan I don’t think there’s anything exclusively stupid about his voters. 126 million Americans voted for a crook or a clown
@SurlyGirl09 @TexasKimberley @chiles1129 @rorymkirkwood @JohnBrennan But he’s so much better than #CrookedHillary
@SurlyGirl09 @TexasKimberley @chiles1129 @rorymkirkwood @JohnBrennan So true for many presidential elections including two terms for Bill Clinton. Bush also. That’s our system
@davidaxelrod @POTUS Your entire life was built around influencing voters through intellectual engagement.  Now, you think so little of Americans with claims a few Russian tweets swayed the election? #CrookedHillary the most flawed candidate in history, lost it on her own
@WWMcClyde @_delconte Hope it takes your mind off #LonghornFootball and #LonghornBasketball

@SurlyGirl09 @TexasKimberley @chiles1129 @rorymkirkwood @JohnBrennan The facts indicate a lot more people get their news from social media, adoption by masses.  His appeal of bypassing the mainstream media won him the White House against all odds. Child’s play?
@jax_superdave @rorymkirkwood @JohnBrennan Pants suits
@benjaminwittes Let’s say the Russians used social media to disparage Hillary. What could they possibly say about her that wasn’t true?  Hell, they did us a favor.
@SurlyGirl09 @TexasKimberley @chiles1129 @rorymkirkwood @JohnBrennan Ha!  Do you really think so little of the American people that some online comments would sway an election? Hillary was such a flawed candidate she allowed this clown to take over the White House. I am waiting on a mass apology from Hillary voters
@SurlyGirl09 @TexasKimberley @chiles1129 @rorymkirkwood @JohnBrennan Understand I didn’t vote for Trump nor do I care for the kind of person he is, but this relentless assault based on phony Russia claims is too much especially since the evidence points to Hillary’s complicity in the dossier

@SurlyGirl09 @TexasKimberley @chiles1129 @rorymkirkwood @JohnBrennan If the media we’re not so corrupt, they would be able to provide this information to the American people. They have chosen to declare Trump the enemy and he is right to ignore them
@SurlyGirl09 @TexasKimberley @chiles1129 @rorymkirkwood @JohnBrennan Russia is a shrinking country of drunks and declining life expectancy.
@tribelaw You have completely lost your dignity. Sad. It was Obama and Hillary that offered the reset button to Russia, and ridiculed Romney for suggesting they were a problem. Then they invaded the Ukraine and the Crimea.
@SurlyGirl09 @TexasKimberley @chiles1129 @rorymkirkwood @JohnBrennan Trump does not need to comment on Russia in order to appease the media. He is the president and is entitled to execute his own strategy. Obama reset with Russia and got stabbed in the back.

@davidaxelrod @POTUS I read the dossier and was unable to find anything remotely criminal or intentional. The silliest thing was claim that Trump declined sweet real estate deals but inexplicably decided to commit perverted sex acts instead? What did I miss?

@laurie_bleier @PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump Now that Israel is naming a train station after Trump it occurred to me the Palestinians missing a golden opportunity. Had they offered Trump to rename Palestine “Trumplandia” he would have given them back the West Bank and Golan Heights
@laurie_bleier @PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump I was dead set against the move, but it shows he had no intention of betraying Israel, that’s all. I try not to confuse my views with the facts at hand.

@CapehartJ Do you find it admirable that @HillaryClinton covered up her husband’s sex crimes for her own political and financial advancement?
@tribelaw Two questions:	1. Does ‘fair value received’ for services at, say, Trump Hotel negate such renumeration being considered emoluments?	2. Are there any other payments to Trump that do not work not include reciprocal services part of the suit?
@AjitPaiFCC @FCC @Energous @MartyMobile I heard it was 15 feet
@laurie_bleier @PalmerReport Seems to me that moving our embassy to Jerusalem dispelled any theory @realDonaldTrump betrayed Israel
@laurie_bleier @SethAbramson OK, I read it thanks. A couple of questions:	1 What do you consider the most damning (true)evidence?	2 What do you see as solid evidence of criminal behavior by Trump? By Page? By Cohen?
@laurie_bleier @SethAbramson Just had a chance to do this. The contents of the dossier is not there. Did I miss something?
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfrlends The @FBI requires civilian oversight much stronger than what congress currently exerts. End entrapment used to excess

@williscuddles_a @DavidCornDC What is hollowing out the middle class is the relentless erosion of purchasing power of the dollar. When the Fed can create $5 trillion out of thin air as it did in 2009, this puny ‘deficit’ doesn’t matter as much as people keeping more.

I want to get reminders from @BankofAmerica before every episode of #VietnamWarPBS! https://t.co/LKUfn6g4u9
@sarahcwestwood She's getting warmer
@peterdaou Well, that foolish book tour is the equivalent of leading with your chin so what do you expect? #everyonesfaultbutmine
@WhiteHouse @LindaSuhler But you're selling weapons to the guys that did this. They are now bombing Yemeni children. Do we ever learn in America? #Saudidevils
@peterdaou Actually it's called brown-nosing
@peterdaou Peter, who charges $3,000 for a VIP ticket to a book signing? She's only making your job harder
@HeyTammyBruce @NYJooo That honeymoon in Nicaragua makes a little more sense now
@1776Stonewall @libertarianma You'd think the people of New Hampshire would care more about the integrity of its elections
@TheEconomist As they should. Nor should a gay baker to be forced to make a cake for a Nazi wedding, etc. Freedom of choice and conscious
@GemMar333 @BeachyKate69 There are a few people in Tennessee you might want to check on
@FreeBeacon Ah, make that second most
@hardball @SenBlumenthal Actually, Hillary selling them 20% of our uranium was all the signal they needed, Senator. Did you even comment on that?If so please retweet
@startelegram @JeffBezos Texas will jail your employees &amp; family for marijuana use whereas they enjoy those rights in CA,CO,etc. Will U put them at risk?
@TPWDnews They sure were fun to catch as kids but I kinda regret that now that they are nearly extinct
@Newsweek @kurteichenwald 9/11 was the result before Trump was the result. Clinton should have had Bin Laden but Monica took his focus.  Still, we put up with it
@kurteichenwald @Newsweek It also allowed Osama bin Laden to knock down our towers
@CillizzaCNN Reptiles have cold blood, silly
@peterdaou Are you saying he acted deplorably?
@peterdaou "Honest"?!  With that one tweet you show how little character matters to you
@EllyBama Because they defy reality. Bad economy of 2009 did more to stop and reverse immigrant flow than our "law"
@KeithOlbermann @Susandorasu My guess is that the number of Trump supporters that care what you think is somewhere around zero
@CheriJacobus He keeps his nose so far up Trump's ass I'm impressed we can understand him
@MattWalshBlog @AnnCoulter I am a fan of DACA and want it codified. Trump gets some credit for forcing Congress to do their jobs.
@Gameonearth1 @pnehlen @ManMountain78R3 It's better to be thought a fool than open your mouth and remove all doubt
@RebekahWorsham @Rowdman57 How can someone who claims to be a legal analyst make such a stupid assertion?
@FreeBeacon Was this the guy in charge of her campaign polling?
RT @shireen818: The US is arming Saudi, refueling their jets midair &amp; providing intelligence. All that's missing is an American pilot in th…
@catoletters Comes the dawn
@RealJamesWoods @palavrossavrvs I'll bet your yard looks pretty good
@peterdaou Great! First explain your view of her use of a private server and deleting 30,000 emails. Was that ok with you? Goes to credibility
@CatoInstitute Exactly what is needed for #Harvey relief. Corporations should donate it this year
@Marmel @Browns Herman Park (next to Cleveland police union HQ) should be renamed Tamir Rice Park so they have to drive by it every damn day #theykilledhim
@dmartosko Sold in a store employing Americans, in a building paying local rent and taxes, etc. You're a fool chasing what passes now for being noticed
@TheTrumpLady Cleveland Police Union seems to be ok two of its own murdered #TamirRice Glad to know they have standards
@bfraser747 No, Brian, it's not. "Immigration Laws" poorly written that ignored the draw of AVAILABLE JOBS which LAW OF NATURE will always fill. Always
RT @_LoveLike_JESUS: .	              JESUS	Paid a Debt He didn't Owe,	             because	      We Owed a Debt	      We couldn't Pay		-- R…
@therealcornett @mikeinknoxville We pass foolish immigration laws that try but fail to reverse the laws of nature-then punish the kids.That will never #MAGA just diminish us
@conncarroll @MarkSKrikorian So what if they earn citizenship? How does that harm you? It thrills me because they are likely to treasure it and be good citizens #win/win
@realDonaldTrump Don't forget to kick that Chinese bank tenant out of your building
@EllyBama Immigration laws that conflict with the laws of nature are pointless. Labor follows capital. We are creating the jobs they seek
@JackPosobiec @EllyBama So that makes deporting them to a strange country ok?  Unless your great-granddaddy was a Pilgrim, you're the same as them
@clevelanddotcom @MattMackowiak But they were ok with killing Tamir Rice
RT @BSO: Don't recall the police union being this upset when Tamir Rice was killed in 2 second for just playing like a kid at a park https:…
@Thomas1774Paine Which would seem to make Jesse's chances exceedingly thin
@nytopinion When we accepted the savaging of Robert Bork it opened the door to politics of personal destruction and harsh partisanship
@CNN It was nothing short of official kidnapping and should be treated as such. There can be no tolerance for official oppression. Fire him now
@AnnCoulter You are one heartless, small minded demagogue. Apparently quite happy to deport kids for a few more hours in the spotlight.
@FLOTUS @mikeinknoxville Best thing you can do to help is get your husband to stop jailing people for marijuana. It is a narrow minded prejudice costing lives and $$
@RepRatcliffe Don't let him off the hook
@kurteichenwald I've never cared about Trump's tax returns, but before he complains about others trying to reduce their taxes, he needs to release them
@chuckwoolery There's a caveman out there somewhere feeling left out
@thehill There are cemeteries in France with many a Texan who died saving you cheese-eating surrender monkeys from the Nazis. Oh the irony
@ColMorrisDavis @MaxBoot Well, when your other choice was Hillary... I'm just saying nutty is better than crooked.
@PlaysTrumpCard @ChristiChat @FLOTUS @voguemagazine I don't think she could get laid at Rikers Island if she had a fistful of pardons
@KeithOlbermann @shadowwraiths @RealSheriffJoe Have you had your rabies shots?
@ShaunKing I'm not quite ready to brush aside his moral failure. It's hard to believe anyone can watch that many innocent lives destroyed
@realDonaldTrump If you cared about Texas you wouldn't waste our time and money on your worthless wall. Besides, it will only hold the water in!
@dmartosko @EllyBama It's kind of like when Jim Bakker went back on TV after his fiasco. If people still give money after her 2016 disaster, we can't blame her
@StanleyCohenLaw Hell, the wall's going to hold water in!
@HeyTammyBruce @GregAbbott_TX was the lone voice in the wilderness who called for an evacuation of Houston. Tough call but good judgment
@washingtonpost The long road back to integrity. Good luck, we need an honest broker in #MSM
@HeyTammyBruce @NYJooo Like her mom dodging sniper fire in Bosnia
@realDonaldTrump This rain keeps up and we'll have our first boat people from Mexico. Hate to break it to you Donald but Texans like Mexicans better than you
@Thomas1774Paine Maybe next they will overturn the Scopes Monkey Trial verdict
@KeithOlbermann When you become the lowest common denominator it's time to retire, Keith. Someone needed to tell you.
@Reuters Her failure to confront Trump was yet another example of her failed leadership skills, it's all focused on personal ambition
@washingtonpost It is akin to the Emmett Till jury acquitting his killers. Official oppression
@DMNOpinion No but it's a lot like Marc Rich's
@AP Bad as it is, he's no Marc Rich
@davidaxelrod @POTUS No problem. Texas has it covered
@nytimes Easy to explain: We sell bombs to Saudis, brag about $$ made, Saudis drop them indiscriminately on Yemeni children, we help them reload!
@FreeBeacon @Rachel_Frommer That would include a sizable number of Clemson alumni so why is he taking their money?  He should resign in protest. #NoBalls
@Wizardfkap @HotlineJosh @jaketapper I would think @Starbucks would hire all Robert Lees in the same manner as welcoming refugees #huddledmasses
@RedState For God's sake, Alabama gave us @jeffsessions. Would you expect anything different with this clown?
@RepStevenSmith And shortly after making $250 million selling his tequila company
@Heminator @benshapiro When @TheRevAl and Jesse Jackson are considered your leadership, this is to be expected
@TheHRH @realDonaldTrump That is only one of dozens of laws from which they exempt themselves. All such exceptions should be outlawed in one bill.
@mitchellvii @EllyBama That doesn't bode well for the Lone Ranger
@RoKhanna The silver in five 1964 quarters ('64 min.wage)is worth about $15. Government stole the future of the bottom 90% by closing the gold window
@TheBlackChannel He's right, they haven't
@kurteichenwald Is this why he has orange hair?
@funder @Jaybezo If you're a Democrat, and supported the most corrupt candidate in history, your words mean nothing. #CrookedHillary #Botharelosers
@dick_nixon I hope you don't listen to these idiots.  You've always been underestimated by your critics https://t.co/kW48a8jwYO
@bennyjohnson @mikeinknoxville The fact that they would never do this if they lived in Russia, China, or North Korea shows how phony they are hiding behind civil rights
@robertjeffress @POTUS This phony he has no interest in waiting for Jesus to judge you. Look at the mega-million dollar empire he is building in downtown Dallas.
@FreeBeacon Further proof we have the government we deserve
@ARnews1936 Please share with us when either of your parents called for the removal of Confederate statues.  I can't seem to recall it
