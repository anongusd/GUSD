To further our efforts, the FY19 appropriations package ensures that American families and businesses are prioritized through development, job growth, and deregulation.
Due to the pro-growth, America-first policies enacted by Republicans during the 115th Congress, our economy is strong with all indicators showing continued growth for years to come. https://t.co/Gy2h99oRQ9
Our nation’s infrastructure is dilapidated and in need of serious investment. The appropriations package being debated now funds improvements to our roads and rail systems and transitions rural America to 21st century technology. https://t.co/QHqRahTJdO
“It is a good down payment that will allow us to build new barriers in the areas that the Border Patrol says it is needed most.”
.@RepKayGranger on H.J.Res. 31: “While this bill falls short of what I would have liked to see, it will provide our Customs and Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents the tools necessary to continue combatting the threat we face.”
“The President is correct, this is a crisis that must be addressed – both for the safety and security of the American people and the wellbeing of those who are coming here.”
.@RepKayGranger on H.J.Res. 31: “Earlier this month, I had an opportunity to travel to the southern border to see firsthand the situation we face and hear from experts on the ground about the best way to address the crisis there.”
Our country’s success largely depends on the health and wellness of the American people. Whether it be combatting the opioid crisis, providing needed research resources, or ensuring food safety, today’s appropriations package makes strides in American health and safety. https://t.co/PdBu1zr3Xh

(2/2) It is the job and responsibility of Congress to appropriate funds. I stand ready and willing to work with the White House and my friends on both sides of the aisle in the House and Senate to find a legislative solution to border security and reopen the government.
(1/2) Ranking Member Granger on tonight's address: As the President clearly laid out, we have a growing humanitarian and security crisis on our southern border. This must be addressed for the safety and security of the American people, as well as those coming to the border.
"I urge House and Senate leadership—Democrat and Republican—and the White House to come together and find a deal that will reopen the  government, provide much-needed border security funding, and help  Americans recover from recent natural disasters—as quickly as possible.”
Chairman Frelinghuysen statement on partial government shutdown:   “It is deeply disappointing that Congress was unable to reach a compromise that would have prevented this destabilizing, unnecessary, partial government shutdown right before the holidays."
"Lastly, this legislation reflects the House position on border security by providing $5B in funding for the construction of physical barriers at our borders. I now urge the Senate to pass this Continuing Resolution and prevent a government shutdown.” - Chairman @USRepRodney
“This legislation fulfills our commitment to help Americans suffering in the wake of natural disasters like hurricanes, wildfires, and typhoons. By providing funding for critical recovery and relief programs, Congress is helping our fellow Americans get back on their feet."
"This measure keeps our government open for six additional weeks to allow the House of Representatives, Senate, and White House additional time to reach an agreement on our remaining Appropriations work."
Chairman @USRepRodney on House passage of temporary government funding measure: “As I have stated many times, a Continuing Resolution is a last resort when it comes to funding the federal government. But I do not support a government shutdown under any circumstances."

Text of the updated Continuing Resolution containing an additional $5B for physical barrier construction and $7.8B in supplemental funding for disaster relief here: https://t.co/F5HDP6KBQp
This six-week Continuing Resolution "gives the House of Representatives, Senate, and White House additional time to come to a responsible compromise that puts the security of our nation first.”
“However, as we’ve clearly seen over the past several weeks, there is still a broad ideological divide when it comes to securing our borders. Despite these differences of opinion, we all agree that a government shutdown is  unacceptable."
“This year, we made great strides to get back to regular order – in fact funding nearly 75% of the government on time for the first time in over two decades  – and that progress was incredibly important for national security and other critical priorities."
Chairman @USRepRodney on CR: "While I would have preferred to see the year end with the completion of all 12 Appropriations bills, at this point, we must move forward with a Continuing Resolution to keep the government running and fund basic services American families rely on."
Chairman @USRepRodney statement on the introduction of a short-term Continuing Resolution keeping the government open through 2/8/19: https://t.co/Nqjpdj6Hjg
75% of the government - including funding for @DeptofDefense - has already been fully funded by annual appropriations legislation completed in September.
The additional two weeks will allow the House and Senate time to complete negotiations on full-year funding legislation for 25% of the federal government.
.@POTUS just signed the two-week Continuing Resolution (H.J. Res. 143) into law - funding the government through December 21, 2018.
This Continuing Resolution is a clean extension of the previous CR, which affects about 25% of discretionary funding for government operations. See the text of the CR here: https://t.co/XJCicFPUI4
The Continuing Resolution now heads to the Senate.
The House just passed H.J. Res. 143, the Continuing Resolution keeping the federal government open through December 21, 2018, by unanimous consent.

Chairman @USRepRodney: I’m particularly pleased to see robust support for the Urban Security Initiative, which provides resources to communities that face the greatest risks, including my home state of NJ, and protection for nonprofits, including faith-based organizations.
Chairman @USRepRodney: The FY19 #HomelandSecurity bill represents a balanced approach to our security that enhances both physical capabilities and preparedness within @DHSgov.
Chairman @usreprodney: This funding will put more officers, agents, and canine teams on the ground. These frontline personnel will help enforce our laws, stem the flow of illegal drugs, and stop the trafficking of humans and other crimes.
Chairman @USRepRodney: The funding provides in the FY19 #HomelandSecurity funding bill will provide the brave men and women at @DHSgov who are working on the frontlines every day with the resources they need to accomplish their critical missions and keep them safe in the process

Subcommittee Chairman @RepKevinYoder: We have taken steps to ensure @fema isn’t simply reacting to emergencies but that we are sufficiently prepared now. We have funded $7.2B for disaster response and recovery efforts.
Subcommittee Chairman @RepKevinYoder: We are a nation of immigrants; it’s part of our heritage and part of our future. We are also a nation of laws. We are a country that can focus on both compassion and public safety. That’s what we do with this bill.
Subcommittee Chairman @RepKevinYoder: This legislation puts us on footing to be one step ahead of the cartels and their billion-dollar criminal industry traversing our border. We’re breaking the cycle of crime being the leading edge in this battle.
Subcommittee Chairman @RepKevinYoder: Funding for barrier and technology is an essential part of the “three-legged stool” of border security - physical barrier, modern technological solutions, and manpower (increasing total staffing at @ICEgov and @CBP).
This includes $5B for new border technology and the construction of barriers to fill critical gaps along the Southwest border, a recommendation informed by the analysts completed by @CBP personnel on the front lines.
The FY19 #HomelandSecurity funding bill provides $58.1B in discretionary funds for @DHSgov to secure our borders, enhance national security, and prepare for and respond to disasters.

Chairman @USRepRodney: the bill continues funding for services to ensure that unaccompanied immigrant children have proper housing and care, and that eligible refugee families have the resources needed to settle in communities across the country and achieve self-sufficiency.
Chairman @USRepRodney: The bill increases funding for lifeline programs like the Community Services Block Grant and the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, rejecting the Administration’s proposed cuts.
Chairman @USRepRodney: The bill makes important investments in programs that will improve the lives of the most vulnerable Americans, including the elderly, children, especially those with special education needs, and veterans.
Chairman @USRepRodney: the legislation includes funding that will help prepare the next generation of Americans to be a productive part of the workforce.

Chairman @USRepRodney: The bill prioritizes @NIH’s life-saving research, with specific increases into antibiotic resistant bacteria, Alzheimers’s, and cancers of all types.

Chair @USRepRodney: Also of critical importance is the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, which protects the U.S. and international financial systems as they counter networks that support terrorists and rogue regimes. We must maintain our global leadership in this.
Chairman @USRepRodney: The bill makes important investments to address many of the challenges our nation faces – including funding to fight the devastating opioid epidemic, and to protect against cybercrime.
Chairman @USRepRodney: Funding is targeted to programs that will help boost economic growth and opportunity. This includes providing stability for our financial system and ensuring consumers and investors are protected, while also stopping burdensome regulations.
The bill creates the brand new Fund for America’s Kids and Grandkids, which safeguards funds for future generations. We cut $585M across the bill to make an initial deposit. Just because you can spend it doesn’t mean you should.
The bill includes major financial reforms. It cuts regulations and streamlines agency processes, and brings transparency and congressional oversight to @CFPB
The bill prioritizes law enforcement, homeland security, and cyber security, providing record funding for the High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas and Drug-Free Communities programs and updates legacy IT systems government-wide.
It includes resources to implement the historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act quickly so American families can use the new system without disruption.
Chairman @RepTomGraves on the highlights of the FY19 Financial Services Appropriations Bill:
The FY19 Financial Services Appropriations bill provides $23.4B in discretionary funding for the programs within its jurisdiction, including IRS, SEC, Small Business Administration, the federal judiciary, and other related agencies.

Chairman @USRepRodney: The FY19 Defense Appropriations bill also supports the modernizing of our military to answer existing perils and the new strategic challenges of the 21st century.
Chairman @USRepRodney: Another key focus of this bill is restoring readiness to ensure that when our men and women in uniform are asked to conduct a mission, they have the best equipment, the best training, and the best support our nation can provide.
Chairman @USRepRodney: Assisted by the two-year caps agreement, we are rebuilding our Armed Forces, and that important effort is supported by this legislation.
Chairman @USRepRodney: We recognize that it is the men and women of our Armed Services - all volunteers - and their families who form the foundation of our national security, and this legislation supports them as fully as we can.
Chairman @USRepRodney: The Defense funding bill is the largest and, accordingly, one of the most - if not the most - important bills of our annual Appropriations process.
We keep our commitment to take care of our service members and their families by providing over $34B for Defense health programs.
The bill includes $95B for research development to ensure our technical advantage against our adversaries.
The bill provides $146B for increased investments to modernize the force.
The bill also includes $246B to repair and improve our military readiness.
The bill provides $144B to address military personnel needs, including full funding for the 2.6% pay raise for our troops.
Chairwoman @RepKayGranger: the bill also supports the secretary’s efforts to work by, with, and through our allies and partners to help share the burden while protecting America’s interests around the world.
Chairwoman @RepKayGranger: Building on the gains we made in 2018, and guided by the new national defense strategy, the bill before you is the next critical step to enable Sec. Mattis to build a more lethal, resilient, and rapidly innovating join force.
Chairwoman @RepKayGranger: the priorities in this bill not only stop the erosion of the US military’s competitive advantage, but also enables our military to restore and increase this advantage.
Chairwoman @RepKayGranger: Congress’s number one responsibility is to provide for the defense of this nation. It is this committee and this bill that fulfills that most fundamental constitutional duty.
The FY19 Defense bill provides $674.6 billion in discretionary funding for @DeptofDefense.

Read Chairman @USRepRodney's full floor statement on H.R. 3, the Spending Cuts to Expired and Unnecessary Programs Act https://t.co/lcguBVVh8G
Chairman @USRepRodney: As I’ve said many times, Congress controls the “power of the purse,” and it is up to us to keep our fiscal house in order by reducing wasteful or unnecessary spending wherever possible.
Chairman @USRepRodney: The bottom line is that it is not in the interest of the taxpayer to let outdated, unnecessary dollar balances sit idle, especially when the nation is facing such high debt and deficits.
In fact, year after year, rescissions are included in our regular  Appropriations bills, and dozens of such rescissions have previously  received bipartisan support.
Sweeping up these extra funds will not cause undue harm or hardship to the essential activities at these federal agencies.
Chairman @USRepRodney: When such funding goes unused for years, those funds should be returned to the Federal Treasury, as taxpayers should expect.
These funds are rescinded from programs and agencies that no longer need or cannot spend the money, or from programs that no longer exist.
The House is now considering H.R. 3, the Spending Cuts to Expired and  Unnecessary Programs Act, which rescinds nearly $15B of federal funding  that is no longer needed. Chairman @USRepRodney is presenting the bill: https://t.co/SgJmJqwMJ3

Chairman @USRepRodney: The FY19 Interior and Environment bill prioritizes the American people - preserving our natural and cultural resources, protecting our communities, and supporting economic growth.
Chairman @USRepRodney: The bill streamlines government operations at the EPA, ensuring it can focus on its core duties and reduce waste and other unnecessary spending.
Chairman @USRepRodney: The bill right-sizes regulatory programs to ensure that our government is working to support American families and their local communities, and not thwarting American economic development.
Chairman @USRepRodney: The bill increases the federal commitment to honoring our treaty agreement with American Indian tribes and Alaskan Natives. This includes support for education, health care, and other important community services.
Chairman @USRepRodney: The bill provides $500M for Payments in Lieu of Taxes, which ensure rural communities with nontaxable federal lands in their bounds are able to fulfill their local government responsibilities like public safety and education.
Chairman @USRepRodney: Importantly, this bill includes much-needed major infrastructure improvements that will improve the lives of Americans, including funding for water infrastructure and to accelerate the cleanup of Superfund sites across the country.
Chairman @USRepRodney: Funding will allow @Interior and @forestservice to continue safe, effective wildfire response, and protect lives, communities, and resources.
Chairman @USRepRodney: This bill provides critical funding to maintain America's natural heritage - promoting the health and safety of our public lands and protecting vital national resources for generations to come.
Chairman @KenCalvert: The bill provides $3.2B for the @NatlParkService, maintaining and building upon critical investments made in FY18 to address longstanding park operations and deferred maintenance needs.

Subcommittee Chairman @KenCalvert: The bill provides robust wildland fire funding totaling $3.9B, fully funding the 10-year average for suppression costs.

Chairman @USRepRodney: Approval of these suballocations today will allow the Committee to move forward and bring our bills to the House floor.
Chairman @USRepRodney: We do not,  nor should we, have unlimited funds to spend. While there are many important programs across the federal government, tough decisions have to be made as to which provide the most benefit to the American people.
Chairman @USRepRodney: They represent a balanced, responsible approach to government spending, ensuring domestic programs are also adequately funded, including infrastructure, efforts to combat opioid abuse, and school safety.
Chairman @USRepRodney: First and foremost, these suballocations prioritize robust national security - rebuilding our Armed Forces, securing our homeland, and supporting our law enforcement agencies.
The 302(b)s abide by the Bipartisan Budget Agreement of 2018, and continue funding for both Defense and domestic priorities as outlined by this bicameral deal.
The Committee is now considering the 302(b) suballocations, which provide the topline funding level for each of the 12 Appropriations bills.
The Committee has approved the FY19 Transportation, HUD Appropriations Bill on a vote of 34-17.
The Committee has resumed consideration of the FY19 Transportation, HUD Appropriations bill.
The Committee stands in recess due to House votes.
The Committee has approved a Manager’s Amendment making technical and noncontroversial changes to the FY19 Transportation, HUD funding bill on a voice vote.
Chairman @USRepRodney: This legislation exercises the power of the purse prudently on behalf of the people we represent at home.
Chairman @USRepRodney: The bill also supports @HUDgov and other critical community development programs. This includes funding for core housing programs that provide shelter for the nation’s most vulnerable citizens
The Administration has spent an inordinate amount of time thwarting these rail safety improvements, the completion of which might actually give some credibility to its infrastructure mantra.
This includes Appropriations for additional funding for the NE Corridor, which is not just critical to New York and New Jersey but to the entire country. 20+ states rely on the East Coast rail system - not to mention hundreds of thousands of passengers who travel every day.
These investments will be used to build critical infrastructure that is vital to our nation’s economy and national security.
Lastly, I’m pleased to see important funding for critical transit projects nationwide, including commuter rail and bus transit.
Funding is also provided for grants that will address critical rail projects nationwide and along the NE Corridor. These are needs that must be addressed promptly just to maintain safe and reliable current rail services for American families and businesses that ship freight.
Chairman @USRepRodney: I’m particularly pleased to see increased funding for critical rail and transit priorities across the country. This includes $1.9B for Amtrak, of which $650M is for the NE Corridor, one of the busiest systems in the world.
Chairman @USRepRodney: Combined with the funding in last year’s Omnibus, Congress has invested an additional $22.7B above FY17 in our transportation infrastructure to get our country and economy moving again.
Chair @USRepRodney: Our nation’s infrastructure has been neglected for far too long. Crumbling roads, aging bridges &amp; rail lines &amp;  clogged waterways are inhibiting economic growth, slowing this nation down. Hard-working Americans deserve safe, reliable, efficient transportation.
Chairman @MarioDB: The bill makes important investments in housing infrastructure - including $3.3B for CDBG and $1.2B for the HOME program. These programs get money straight to state and local governments to support decision-making where it should happen: at the community level
Chairman @MarioDB: Our commitment to help the most vulnerable among us with decent, affordable housing also helps get families back on their feet, and back to self-sufficiency.
Chairman @MarioDB: Every state - and thousands of localities - will see the real impact of this funding as construction crews get to work on road and bridge repairs that are needed right now. This investment will help us strengthen our infrastructure and create jobs.
Chairman @MarioDB: For @USDOT, the bill provides $28B in discretionary funding and $88B in total funding. This includes $4.25B in federal highway funding above the FAST Act - a 10% increase for highway and bridge projects nationwide, and the largest increase in this bill
Chairman @MarioDB: We worked to ensure that there is no place for waste, fraud, and abuse of our constituents’ hard-earned tax dollars. We also made sure we didn’t grow the bureaucracy here in DC; this is why we prioritized programs that get money directly to states.
Chairman @MarioDB: This bill builds on our accomplishments in the 2018 Omnibus and makes a second historic down payment to rebuild our nation’s infrastructure. This bill is THE infrastructure bill Congress will consider this year.
Chairman @MarioDB: This bill reflects our commitment to rebuilding our nation’s infrastructure and to take care of the most vulnerable among us - especially the elderly, the disabled, and our veterans.

Chairman @USRepRodney: This legislation also makes America more prosperous. This includes funding for @CommerceGov programs that spur economic development and promote rational US trade priorities.

Chairman @USRepRodney: I’m pleased to see nearly $450 million provides for grant programs to fight opioid abuse as the epidemic is killing more people than ever.
Chairman @USRepRodney: An increase of $793 million above current levels for @TheJusticeDept will give federal law enforcement more tools to stop crime and terrorism and bring criminals to justice.
Chairman @USRepRodney: First and foremost, this bill prioritizes national security and law enforcement - protecting the interests of the United States and our people against all who would do us harm.
Chairman @USRepRodney: From encouraging scientific innovation, to supporting economic development, to enforcing our laws and fighting crime, this bill provides funding for programs that make our nation safer, stronger, and more prosperous.

Agriculture Subcommittee Chairman @Robert_Aderholt: The Committee has worked for months to produce a bill that really, truly invests in the needs of this country, and it includes some solid investments in agriculture.
Read Chairman @USRepRodney's full floor statement in support of the FY18 Omnibus: https://t.co/1ufyAMq4Km
Chairman @USRepRodney: It is time that we fully fund the federal government for FY 2018. Our current Continuing Resolution expires tomorrow. It is in the best interest of the American people that we enact this legislation and turn our attention toward the next fiscal year.
Chairman @USRepRodney: All of these investments are made responsibly – implementing strong oversight at every level of government to ensure we get the most out of every tax dollar.
Chairman @USRepRodney: The package targets approximately $4 billion to fight the opioid epidemic that is devastating families across the country – the largest investment in addressing this public health emergency to date.
Chairman @USRepRodney: Funding is directed towards school safety, providing the training, mental health services, and grants to communities that will help prevent the kind of tragedy and heartbreak that occurred in Parkland, Florida.
Chairman @USRepRodney: Funding is focused on critical domestic priorities, addressing urgent needs that will improve quality of life for all Americans and support economic growth and job creation – especially infrastructure.
Chairman @USRepRodney: In addition to strengthening our national defense, this legislation boosts security here at home – stronger border infrastructure, additional “boots on the ground,” and better technology and equipment that will close gaps at our borders.
Chairman @USRepRodney: The Omnibus fully funds a 2.4% pay raise for our service men and women – the largest in eight years – and provides the largest dollar total ever for @DeptVetAffairs.
Chairman @USRepRodney: Most importantly, it includes historic investments in our Armed Forces – including the largest year-to-year increase in funding for the Department of Defense since the beginning of the War on Terror.
The legislation provides $1.3T in discretionary funding for the federal government, including $78.1 billion for the Global War on Terror and Overseas Contingency Operations. This meets the caps provided in the recent budget agreement.
Chairman @USRepRodney: This funding legislation represents thousands of hours of work and input by Members of Congress. It is the product of hard-fought negotiations between the House, Senate, and White House.

The House is now voting on the Bipartisan Budget Act. Read Chairman @USRepRodney's full floor statement on the legislation here --&gt; https://t.co/qdjlMNjeH2
Chairman @USRepRodney: These topline spending levels will enable us to get to work immediately on our 12 Appropriations bills to wrap up fiscal year 2018, and to quickly turn our attention to fiscal year 2019.
Chairman @USRepRodney: Especially important is a substantial increase in funds for national defense. Our nation faces multiple security challenges. We must be prepared to meet these challenges, and we must take care of the men and women in uniform, who do the work of freedom.
Chairman @USRepRodney: After years of reductions to military funding and months of uncertainty caused by Continuing Resolutions, it’s time that we provide our Armed Forces what they need to rebuild and keep our nation safe!
Chair @USRepRodney: This bill will allow us to move past this destructive cycle of Continuing Resolutions, which undermine the Appropriations process and promote only more uncertainty and doubt about our government’s ability to function, and meet the needs of those we represent!
Chairman @USRepRodney on the Bipartisan Budget Agreement: This legislation will help our nation move forward – without the threat of shutdown or default, and with greater budget certainty.
The House will soon take up the Bipartisan Budget Act, which sets topline funding levels for FY8 and FY19, extends government funding through March 23 while full-year funding bills are written, provides emergency disaster funding, and includes other important provisions.
It is the intention of the Appropriations Committee to go to work immediately to complete the 12 annual, critically important funding bills as soon as possible. (3/3)
@USRepRodney It is also essential that the areas that have suffered from natural disasters receive the aid they need and deserve to recover and rebuild. This legislation allows these funds to move forward. (2/3)
Chairman @USRepRodney statement on Bipartisan Budget Act: “It is time that Congress does its Constitutional duty to enact responsible legislation that funds the entirety of the federal government, most importantly our national defense. (1/3)

Read Chairman @USRepRodney's full floor statement on the fifth Continuing Resolution for Fiscal Year 2018 https://t.co/K9otueYQ78
Chairman @USRepRodney: As soon as Congressional and White House leaders reach a bipartisan budget agreement - which could and should happen at any moment - @HouseAppropsGOP will get to work immediately to finish negotiations on all 12 year-long funding bills.
Chairman @USRepRodney: While I am pleased that we are including the Defense Appropriations bill on this bill, we still must pass all 12 Appropriations bills for the 2018 fiscal year, as well as our third Emergency Disaster Supplemental.
Chairman @USRepRodney: CRs are bad fiscal policy.	- They don't allow programs to start, grow, be cut, or eliminated.	- They maintain outdated policies.	- They are wasteful and prevent careful budget planning from taking place.	- They undermine Congressional oversight
Chairman @USRepRodney: We ask a great deal of our men and women in uniform, and we have an obligation to provide them and their families the resources they need to stay safe, and to complete their missions successfully, at home and abroad.
Chairman @USRepRodney: Governing from CR to CR just creates more unpredictability, more instability and has real-life consequences for both troops and civilians who support them.
The CR makes very limited technical changes in funding levels for only the most essential needs, including to prevent delays for the 2020 Census, to ensure the Judiciary is able to pay jurors, and to provide emergency funding for @SBAgov disaster loans.

As @POTUS said during tonight's #SOTU, "Our task [to the American people] is to respect them, to listen to them, to serve them, to protect them, and to always be worthy of them."
There is no more critical duty of Congress than upholding our Constitutional responsibilities to provide the men and women of our Armed Forces the resources they need to successfully complete missions and advance U.S. interests around the globe. #SOTU
.@POTUS: "I am asking asking the Congress to end the dangerous defense sequester and fully fund our military." Today, the House passed a bill providing $659.2 billion for @DeptofDefense and the men and women of our Armed Forces. #SOTU
Having safe, efficient, and well-functioning transportation infrastructure is critical to our quality of life. We will continue to make investments in essential programs that keep our economy moving. #SOTU

Chairman @USRepRodney: It is my hope that this will be our last Continuing Resolution, that Congressional Leadership and the White House will quickly come to an agreement on topline spending levels, and that we can complete our Appropriations work for FY18 in short order.
Chairman @USRepRodney: It is critical that we enact all 12, full-year funding bills to ensure that our Armed Forces have the resources they need to accomplish their missions &amp; that our government maintains programs that are important to the lives and livelihoods of all Americans
Chairman @USRepRodney: A Continuing Resolution is not the preferred way to conduct the nation’s fiscal business, but at this point it is absolutely necessary to avoid a costly, destabilizing government shutdown.
Chairman @USRepRodney: It is our Congressional duty to prevent a shutdown from happening, and to ensure that the American people have access to the government programs and services they depend on.
Chairman @USRepRodney: This measure is another step - and hopefully one of the last - toward completing our Appropriations work for Fiscal Year 2018.
