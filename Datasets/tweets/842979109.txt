RT @realDonaldTrump: The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke. @CNN and the little watch‚Ä¶
Joe Scarborough I am disappointed in you.  What a shame!

"Crooked Bill" tried to clean "Crooked Hillary's" soul but failed.  They have an incredible amount of baggage!
"Crazy Bernie" sold out his followers.  His revolution talk was all a farce. He is now better known a "Chicken Bernie".
The resignation of DWS as head of the DNC, is the beginning of the end for "Crooked" Hillary &amp; Tim "LAME".  I knew there was a God!
The Democratic Ticket is composed of "Crooked" Hillary &amp; Tim "LAME".  The DNC is rigged more than any other organization.
The democratic ticket is the most pandering of all times. Disgusting for CNN to say that Tim LAME speaks "flawless" Spanish.  Really!!!
This US is really upside down.  The US Chamber of Commerce should be ashamed, backing the elite and turning their back on the Middle Class!
I am a blessed father.  I have a son and 2 daughters.  Great human beings, they are also well educated.  2 PhD's and 1 MBA.  A great legacy!
Ros-Lehtinen traiciona al voto de la clase media republicana.  Una prueba m√°s de que su alma est√° vendida a los intereses creados.
Paul Ryan is a Coward!
Tea Party members of Congress please consider giving Paul Ryan a no confidence vote ASAP.  He is part of the problem.  The elite is blinded!
I just saw Paul Ryan on CNN, a total disconnect between Washington and the voters continues.  These career politicians are a total loss!
Bill and Hillary Clinton are emblematic of what is wrong with America.  We need to support the Trump movement is America's Hope!
Do we really want to see Bill Clinton lounging in the White House, smoking a cigar again?  NOT!
How about if we All work towards a free Democratic Cuba.  The way the US government is going about it will not "Make Cuba Great Again".
The real history of the Cuban Exiles is either being trampled or ignored.  I am relieved that my parents are not here to suffer through this
Let the political farce begin in Cuba with Obama and his immoral cronies visiting my oppressed homeland.  I guess we are an afterthought.  üòà
Romney is the face of the misguided establishment that much rather go see the country go down in flames at the hands of HC.  We must vote!
54 years have passed and I have been called, Latino, Hispanic, Cuban-American, etc.  People have to realize that I am a "Cuban Exile" period
The Stop Trump Movement is full of "Gravy Train Republicans" protecting the million $ a year lobbying fees.  Truly Shameful!
Sorry to say that Marco Rubio has shown he was not ready for prime time.  He has taken a huge leap backwards in his political career!
Exiled Cubans continue to be disrespected by the elite political class of both parties.  It is time to set the record straight.  Stand firm!
To my Cuban brothers and descendants in exile, yes in exile.  It is time we define and outline our displeasure with the US Gov position!
It is sad that R, C &amp; K joined Rachel Maddow in cheerleading for the protesters in Chicago.  Shameful!  Where is Romney?

Then Mich Gov &amp; HC tried playing the race card in 2008.  This is a State that has more black men in prison than on the streets.  HC not!!!
Let the Republican voters speak.  The party elite must start showing some respect for the wishes of the voters.  Our democracy is at stake.
It is a tough time for the political elite.  The voters are the ones that have the power and they are tired of the status quo.
Mr Romney you had another 47% moment.  I can not believe how the elite on both parties feel empowered to tell the disenfranchised what to do
What happened to the political satire at the Oscars?  Has David Hill wasted an opportunity to ridicule the broken down political process???

Let's get real, the pundits do not understand that the Republicans will not nominate a Spanish surname to follow 8 yrs of a black president.

I am shocked by the fact that our country still continues to put up with the shameless Clinton mafia.  Warped picture!

Trump is less than 48 hrs away from making history in Iowa.  I just can not believe how light weight the other candidates look next to him.

MLB does not do business with Pete Rose but they do business with the Castro brothers in Cuba.  What is wrong with this picture?
Cuba is a Police State,  or in Reality a terrorist state.  The US Governement pretends that all is wonderful all of a sudden? Shocking!!!
It is time we stand up and be counted.  The exiled Cuban community lacks historical perspective.  Viva Cuba Libre!
Stay tuned for huge positive announcement involving BattleFrog.  Battling is Believing!  Gotta Live It!
Visca Bar√ßa!
CNN just went dark after an interview between Tapper and Jeb Bush. Came back to the behind the scene exchange.  Was it a mistake?
Next Sat Nov 21, BattleFrog (OCR) will be in South Florida.  Go to https://t.co/SbTw8kiIZW. Battling is Believing. Gotta Live It.  See you!
It is important to note that Cuban lives matter.
