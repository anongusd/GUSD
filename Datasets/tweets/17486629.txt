https://t.co/qzyIRyFd7W
Words!	The Way is beyond language,	for in it there is		no yesterday		no tomorrow		no today.
One thing, all things;	move among and intermingle,	without distinction.	To live in this realization	is to be without anxiety about nonperfection.	To live in this faith is the road to nonduality,	because the non-dual is one with the trusting mind.
Infinitely large and infinitely small;	no difference, for definitions have vanished	and no boundaries are seen.	So too with Being and non-Being.	Waste no time in doubts and arguments	that have nothing to do with this.
And this truth is beyond extension or diminution in time or space;	in it a single thought is ten thousand years.		Emptiness here, Emptiness there,	but the infinite universe stands always before your eyes.
To come directly into harmony with this reality	just simply say when doubt arises, "Not two."	In this "not two" nothing is separate,	nothing is excluded.	No matter when or where,	enlightenment means entering this truth.
All is empty, clear, self-illuminating,	with no exertion of the mind's power.	Here thought, feeling, knowledge, and imagination are of no value.	In this world of Suchness	there is neither self nor other-than-self.
For the unified mind in accord with the Way	all self-centered striving ceases.	Doubts and irresolutions vanish	and life in true faith is possible.	With a single stroke we are freed from bondage;	nothing clings to us and we hold to nothing.
in this causeless, relationless state.	Consider motion in stillness	and stillness in motion;	both movement and stillness disappear.	When such dualities cease to exist	Oneness itself cannot exist.	To this ultimate finality	no law or description applies.
To understand the mystery of this One-essence	is to be released from all entanglements.	When all things are seen equally	the timeless Self-essence is reached.	No comparisons or analogies are possible
If the eye never sleeps,	all dreams will naturally cease.	If the mind makes no discriminations,	the ten thousand things	are as they are, of single essence.
Rest &amp; unrest derive from illusion;	with enlightenment there is no liking and disliking.	All dualities come from ignorant inference	They are like dreams or flowers in air:	foolish to try to grasp them.	Gain and loss, right &amp; wrong;	such thoughts must finally be abolished at once.
The wise man strives to no goals	but the foolish man fetters himself.	There is one Dharma, not many;	distinctions arise from the clinging needs of the ignorant.	To seek Mind with discriminating mind	is the greatest of all mistakes.
If you wish to move in the One Way	do not dislike even the world of senses and ideas.	Indeed, to accept them fully	is identical with true Enlightenment.
Obey the nature of things	and you will walk freely &amp; undisturbed.	When thought is in bondage the truth is hidden,	for everything is murky and unclear.	The burdensome practice of judging	brings annoyance and weariness.	What benefit can be derived	from distinctions and separations?
Clinging cannot be limited;	even to be attached to the idea of enlightenment	is to go astray.	Just let things be in their own way	and there will be neither coming nor going.
To live in the Great Way	is neither easy nor difficult.	But those with limited views	are fearful and irresolute;	the faster they hurry, the slower they go.
In this Emptiness the two are indistinguishable	and each contains in itself the whole world.	If you do not discriminate between coarse and fine	you will not be tempted to prejudice and opinion.
Things are objects because there is a subject or mind;	and the mind is a subject because there are objects.	Understand the relativity of these two	and the basic reality: the unity of emptiness.
When no discriminating thoughts arise,	the old mind ceases to exist.	When thought objects vanish,	the thinking-subject vanishes,	and when the mind vanishes, objects vanish.
Although all dualities come from the One,	do not be attached even to this One.		When the mind exists undisturbed in the Way,	nothing in the world can offend, 	and when a thing can no longer offend,	it ceases to exist in the old way.
Do not search for the truth;	only cease to cherish opinions.	Do not remain in the dualistic state;	avoid such pursuits carefully.	If there is even a trace	of this and that, of right and wrong,	the Mind-essence will be lost in confusion.
To return to the root is to find the meaning,	but to pursue appearances is to miss the source.	At the moment of inner enlightenment,	there is a going beyond appearance and emptiness.	The changes that appear to occur in the empty world	we call real only because of our ignorance.
The more you talk and think about it,	the further astray you wander from the truth.	Stop talking and thinking	and there is nothing you will not be able to know.
Those who do not live in the single Way	fail in both activity and passivity,	assertion and denial.	To deny the reality of things is to miss their reality;	to assert the emptiness of things	is to miss their reality.
When you try to stop activity to achieve passivity	your very effort fills you with activity.	As long as you remain in one extreme or the other,	you will never know Oneness.
The Way is perfect like vast space	where nothing is lacking and nothing is in excess.	Indeed, it is due to our choosing to accept or reject	that we do not see the true nature of things.	Be serene in the oneness of things	and such erroneous views will disappear by themselves.
If you wish to see the truth	then hold no opinions for or against anything.	To set up what you like against what you dislike	is the disease of the mind.		When the deep meaning of things is not understood	the mind's essential peace is disturbed to no avail.
The Great Way is not difficult	for those who have no preferences.	When love and hate are both absent	everything becomes clear and undisguised.	Make the smallest distinction, however,	and heaven and earth are set infinitely apart

@BTCare I will certainly sharing my lousy experience with BT
@BTCare Is there not some level of urgent escalation department who can respond, who I can call and get this dealt with. He already got a message saying that an unknown person had tried to access his account. I am really completely and utterly fed up and notice I have 355k followers...
@BTCare My rates are £40 p/h so client is out of pocket for at least £200 today. I have not been given a case number, so I have to go through this each time from the start, and walk the support person through the problem each time until they get it
@BTCare And says they will be able to call back tomorrow. This is not convenient. Tomorrow is Saturday. I have been pursuing this all day since 10am trying to get a resolution for my client - whose identity is in danger of being stolen. It is urgent. Hopeless response from BT
@BTCare it takes us through to the BT site which says "Sorry this BTID does not appear on our system. Please check and try again." So I tried Live Chat again and the guy made all kinds of promises (again) and then eventually gave up, and says he can escalate it to level 2
@BTCare They promised to fix this. And promised a call back which never came. I have been on this case all day since 10am. So the client can log into his emails through https://t.co/9d72plPoHD email interface, but when we try to change his insecure password
@BTCare Got through to India. This guy helped with the problem somewhat. There were two ww account numbers on My BT, a current one and an old one. He got the old one removed, after a call back from level 2 support, but my client's email address is still not associated with his main BTID
@BTCare I called BT at 10am, was on for 45 mins. transferred to premium email support. No resolution despite promises. referred back to main support. Call got cut off. Tried live chat. Incompetent service and no grasp of situation I had explained several times already. Called in again
