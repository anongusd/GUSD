The Truth Behind Drug Rebates and How to Help Make Drugs More Affordable https://t.co/n0twsX47O8
“Together, CVS Health and Aetna will help address the challenges our health care system is facing, and we’ll be able to offer better care and convenience at a lower cost.” CEO Merlo $CVS
“We welcome competition; we expect more of it in the years to come, and we are confident that we ourselves are key disrupters and pivotal players in helping define that new landscape.” CEO Merlo $CVS
“With a physical presence in almost every community across the country, we have the unique ability to meet patients where they are and provide the care and services they need.” CEO Merlo $CVS
Last year, drug price growth for our clients was only 0.2% on a per capita basis, despite AWP inflation of nearly 10%. For a more in-depth discussion regarding our approaches to making drugs affordable: https://t.co/xO2D7L1XU7
“The time-tested techniques used by PBMs to control drug costs are projected to save the health care system more than $600 billion over the next decade.” CEO Merlo $CVS
“No matter what may happen to the ability to rebate, PBMs will still be needed to drive discounts and costs savings for their clients and members, and the PBM model will continue to evolve.” CEO Merlo $CVS
“The idea that rebate retention is correlated with higher drug prices is entirely false ... the reality is that in 2018, we expect retained rebates to be ~ $300 million, or 3% of our annual adjusted EPS” CEO Merlo $CVS
Q3 Guidance: “We expect Adjusted EPS in the third quarter to be in the range of $1.68 to $1.73 per share, reflecting an increase of 12.5% to 15.5% versus Q3 of ’17.” CFO Denton $CVS
2019 Formulary Strategy: “Effective January 1st, we plan to remove 23 products from our Standard Control Formulary, while adding back 4 products.” CFO Denton $CVS
PBM Selling Season: “Current gross wins stand at ~ $1.8 billion with net-new business of ~ $200 million. To date, we have completed more than 70% of our client renewals…and our current retention rate is slightly higher than levels we’ve seen in the past.” CFO Denton $CVS
“We must execute on our initiatives, deliver high levels of patient and client service, and drive additional efficiencies so that when the market does turn around, Omnicare is well-positioned to take advantage and grow.” CFO Denton $CVS
“We remain optimistic about Omnicare’s long-term growth potential and its relevance to our value creation strategy.” CFO Denton $CVS
Q2 Earnings: “Overall, the company posted extremely strong financial performance in our core business as we met or exceeded all elements of our guidance in Q2.” CFO Denton $CVS
Q2 Earnings: “Strong revenue, adjusted EPS, gross and operating margins along with cash flow, demonstrate our success in driving value.” CEO Merlo $CVS
“The genuine enthusiasm and the depth of talent throughout the CVS and Aetna organizations will be key assets as we focus on realizing the potential of our combination.” $CVS
“Our solid performance builds upon a strong foundation for a seamless integration of CVS and Aetna with one goal: to transform the consumer health care experience and, by doing so, deliver long-term profitable growth for shareholders.” $CVS

CVS Health year-to-date cash flow from operations of $5.3 billion; year-to-date free cash flow of $4.4 billion $CVS
GAAP diluted loss per share from continuing ops of $(2.52), including a $3.9 billion goodwill impairment charge related to the Long-term Care (“LTC”) business $CVS

There is great potential for public and private stakeholders to work together to improve #MedicationAdherence. @PoliticoLive #ProHC
The @US_FDA plays a role by prioritizing breakthrough drug approvals and encouraging competition. @PoliticoLive #ProHC
In 2015 alone, generic drugs saved Americans $227B and more than $1 trillion over the last decade. @PoliticoLive #ProHC
One of most effective solutions to lower drug costs is introducing competition, particularly from generics/biosimilars. @PoliticoLive #ProHC
As of July 2016, median time for generic to reach approval = 47mo, compared to 12mo for the European Medicines Agency. @PoliticoLive #ProHC
More than 4,000 generic drugs were pending approval at the beginning of 2017, hampering competition. @PoliticoLive #ProHC
The @US_FDA can encourage competition and innovation, which has a downstream impact on patient access and cost. @PoliticoLive #ProHC
1 in 2 Americans has a chronic illness; 85% of healthcare dollars spent on caring for these Americans. @PoliticoLive #ProHC https://t.co/AIcN2Urq5W
