‚ÄúYoung professionals are ambitious, they want to create a better life. If they don‚Äôt get that, they‚Äôll go somewhere else. But they want to get that here.‚Äù @EngageCleveland
One key message from the @EngageCleveland survey results was for Cleveland to keep going, to keep pushing.
Employers are catalysts for finding civic engagement opportunities.
A young professional that is involved in their community is 2-3x more likely to stay in that community.  @EngageCleveland on civic engagement.
‚ÄúMost people in their 20‚Äô-30‚Äôs come back to Cleveland because of the cost of living, their friends and family are here, the community is here.‚Äù @EngageCleveland
