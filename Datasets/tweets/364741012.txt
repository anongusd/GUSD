@brianjacksonXP @Kkh3grls @xan_desanctis Psalm 137:9 Happy is the one who seized your baby and dashes it against the rocks!!! Really?  I mean really?? This is your Gods word.... talk about infanticide!!
@brianjacksonXP @Kkh3grls @xan_desanctis Here’s an interesting fact: 35-40% OF ALL conceptions miscarry. Most without the mother even knowing. If you believe in an omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient god, then YOU need to have a look at what he’s doing.... because he’s letting you down!
@brianjacksonXP @Kkh3grls @xan_desanctis I’m assuming you are a god botherer. If so, your God boastfully talks about killing 2.5 million women, children, men in that bible. Read 2 Kings 2:23-24 and tell me that’s not ‘ infanticide’ of sorts. You deal with that shit and let others deal with theirs.
@brianjacksonXP @Kkh3grls @xan_desanctis Allowing abortions for unviable Fetus’ after 24 weeks of pregnancy.... don’t have an issue with that. Once again, it’s up to the mother. She has to deal with all aspects of it.
@brianjacksonXP @Kkh3grls @xan_desanctis You wearing a kilt doesnt diminish my atheism
@brianjacksonXP @Kkh3grls @xan_desanctis It says nothing about your religious stance.
@brianjacksonXP @Kkh3grls @xan_desanctis Yes, infanticide.... the killing of a born baby. No one I know of is advocating that. Abortion is legal and should remain so. And it is up to the pregnant mother to choose whether she carries full term or not. It’s her body, her choice. As you choose what happens to your body.
@brianjacksonXP @Kkh3grls @xan_desanctis Here’s a question for you? Are you a Christian and if so, believe in what’s written in the bible and it’s teachings?
@brianjacksonXP @Kkh3grls @xan_desanctis You fantasise about infanticide. Makes me fear for any kids you have.
@brianjacksonXP @Kkh3grls @xan_desanctis Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy. Infanticide is something completely different. That concept would be something more akin to your way of thinking. Termination of a life outside of the uterus, or just making life hell in a cage.....
@brianjacksonXP @Kkh3grls @xan_desanctis Where have I advocated infanticide? I see nothing wrong with abortion in a world which has gone from 2 billion to 7.5 in 100 years. Overpopulation will kill us all eventually.
@SpectatorUSA @JacobWohl Not big on the counting thing is he!
@WalshFreedom Nonsense. The US government is dishing out socialism in a plethora of programs, to individuals and to corporations and has done so since its inception. Get over yourself. All governments around the world are socialist in nature, it’s the degree to which they are that varies.
@brianjacksonXP @Kkh3grls @xan_desanctis Here’s an idea. You should just worry about the abortions you have and let others worry about the abortions they have. That way you will have more time to enjoy the optics of kids in cages.
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump So sad, too bad.
@advertard @Loud_Lass ‘I heard Justin Bieber was going to be here’
@Kkh3grls @brianjacksonXP @xan_desanctis Brian is all about making sure they’re born so he CAN lock them up in cages and treat them like shit. He’s a real Christian!!!
@SkyNewsAust @jeffreys_mike @realDonaldTrump 2 hours of inane rambling isn’t showmanship. It’s a case study in mental disease.
@deemadigan They should ask me: I can give them 30 minutes of the most vilest language when it comes to royalty and not break stride.
@jmfmck @Mrdamag3_81 @9NewsAUS We should all be held to a higher standard of behaviour. His undoubted talent probably took precedence and he seems to have forgotten that others exist. I’m embarrassed for him and it seems to be too late for him to learn humility. And it will impact him later in life.
@ellenmfanning When you have people like the Archbishop of Sydney trying to diminish the severity of Pell’s acts, for which he was convicted, then the backlash is to be expected. The church from the top is tone deaf to public expectations. They are all about protecting the institution first.
@jmfmck @Mrdamag3_81 @9NewsAUS He will burn you, over and over.
@jmfmck @Mrdamag3_81 @9NewsAUS It’s a good thing you forgive him Jacque.
@AttardMon @PatsKarvelas My mum told me about this letter into the paper yesterday. Said it made her cry..... it’s hurts just reading and comprehending the impact that has had on someone so young.
@JoshButler I don’t have to be quick. A jury did it for me.
@BuzzRothfield Nuggz has had a coupla too many shandies today by the looks of it.
@NickMcKim I bet the ALP gets more votes than the Greens do in Tasmania which makes a farce of your comment. So too will the LNP, but there’s no accounting for taste.
@CloudsAsDrugs @DeanObeidallah I was going for accuracy.
@9NewsAUS A glorious week? He won, but he also sooked about a cut, wanted to retire injured, whinged about the crowd...... .Meh, he’s burnt too many bridges to be universally admired in Australia. Only the rusted on supporters will be happy for him.
@CloudsAsDrugs @DeanObeidallah It’s a common colloquialism in Australia.
@MikeCarlton01 A whole nation, not a few people.
@BillKristol When you forget your pacifier and find a security blanket instead.
@stonecold2050 Needy
@LyleShelton But being exposed to Pell and his band of rock spiders is ok? That environment is more damaging to a child than anything. You lot have your heads up your arse.
@AshaRangappa_ How could anyone devote part of their career listening to that moron? I can’t handle 10 seconds of listening to him. I turn the sound down or change channel/station.
@DeanObeidallah I call a lot of people shifty. Not one of them is Jewish though!
@AOC For starters, the filth who did 9/11 wouldn’t let a woman fly a plane, let alone drive a car....
@xan_desanctis Too bad these right to lifers aren’t out there defending the already born kids locked up in cages by their right to life hero.
@SkyNewsAust @JulieBishopMP As long as she believes that. The LNP are dying on the vine and even Jules couldn’t put lipstick on it.
@MKGenest @RealMuckmaker Looks like the prune juice just kicked in and he’s gotta back one out.
@SkyNewsAust @LyleShelton He stands for pedophilia? Or just pedophiles? Or both?
@MikeCarlton01 You can be a dickhead and operate effectively within the Canberra bubble.
@SkyNewsAust @KKeneally If you believe God is an omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient force, then that god is a sadist. On the other hand, just believe in yourself and what you can effect and affect and you are closer to the answer.
@dominowski @WalshFreedom They made ignorance fashionable.
@lauferlaw @ChrisCuomo Ari Melber had him on the other week. I spent a bit of time yelling at inanimate objects when he spoke.
@Dax_x98 @DonnaWithrow2 I don’t think God period.
@JohnAnzo It’s not a liberal surge. A liberal surge would mean a more tolerant policy base. It’s a mild push to the left at most. The intolerance to other voices and attempts to bully policy through is a behavioural issue.

@BelindaJones68 @Cobra1A @ScottMorrisonMP He’s making his moment in the spotlight last as long as he can make it last, coz he’s going to cop a lot of shit for the inevitable shellacking coming their way.
@Redpainter1 I can live with either. But prison is preferable only because I know he’d hate the humiliation along with not being the centre of attention.
@QuentinDempster @Cobra1A @australian Nonsense.
@JimmiDoodle @LesStonehouse @PeterDutton_MP @nobby15 I’d pick Abbott over Dutton. It’s hard to fathom the very concept of picking Abbott over anyone, Abbott is a fool, but Dutton is a malignancy.
@maddow More Al Crapone than anything.
@jonathanvswan It would get thrown out of court. There are no finite measures on hopes, expectations, changing ideas of what might happen to you.

@rebeccaballhaus ‘It’s our view that anyone who heard Trump and Cohen discussing how to structure the payment should forget what they heard. Fake truth!!’
@Acosta They avoided mentioning Trump. He made the statement, he needs to cop their wrath.
@acnewsitics @kathrynresister I’m guessing their penis size.
@hughriminton @Cobra1A It’s like the coalition have done a crash course at Trump Uni in disinformation and implausible lying.
@MichaelAvenatti @Twitter He’s trying to become the new Roger Stone.
@thehill I don’t think they will. I think they will just accumulate a truck load of evidence before 2020 and keep Trump unsettled and agitated and hit him with all the findings in the campaign to keep him answering to it all.
@AustralianLabor @SwannyQLD It’s a train wreck.
@TheRynheart The pharmaceuticals haven’t got hold of her yet. But then again, neither has common sense!!
@WalshFreedom So, what you’re saying is that it’s another typical Trump result. He’s hopeless.

@GovBillWeld It would be very amusing if Romney decided to run.
@Joshn11 @sallymcmanus .....than, not then. Geesh! I think it’s very obvious you spend very little time ‘practicing ‘ the language. And I’m very lucky to make money out this in another guise. Right wing morons like yourself are just practice fodder.
@thehill No getting past Kev!
@gtconway3d @ShereeYablon @JoyceWhiteVance @neal_katyal What if he for instance... did shoot someone on 5th Ave and you had a Senate that wouldn’t vote to remove? Given the current partisanship in Congress, the possibility is that a President has King like status. The system is flawed if it allows justice to be delayed.
@RadioFreeTom He went a lot of miles to achieve sweet FA

@Kokomothegreat @alexnazaryan Is it too late to take Scott Walker home and abort him?
@CUhlmann @9NewsAUS Who is going to turn the lights out?
@VictoriaPolice @HumanHeadline Proof that you shouldn’t wear your cap backwards.
@RepDonBeyer He won’t resign. This White House doesn’t care about optics. It will do whatever it wants, when it wants and laws, regulations, protocols mean little to them.
@Joshn11 @sallymcmanus Technically, spelling is the correct correction here. Grammar can also refer to spoken communication and is therefore not precise with your context....  typical right wing uneducated moron!!!
@wvjoe911 @cryborg What’s the problem with that?
@Joshn11 @sallymcmanus The word you’re looking for is ‘lose’.
@goldengateblond That’s the very definition of a ‘vacant lot’

@BevanShields That ship is empty except for the rusted in rats like Abbott and Andrews.
@thistallawkgirl Or the bottom in the GOP’s case.
@JoyceWhiteVance Damn hamburglars!
@JoeNBC That’s the GOP now. That’s what they stand for.
@mkraju @SunlenSerfaty All bones are of a race. My bones are Caucasian bones. Are they racist bones? I hope not.
@RVAwonk Wanting to work in the White House and expecting to work on the White House can be 2 different things semantically.
@australian That would mean giving the ABC more money.

@Melissa4Durack @DaveSharma @gabrielleupton $3.5 billion won’t provide a solution to any climate issues. It’s a band aid when a change in mindset and practices is required.

@theheraldsun The art of the dill
@ndrew_lawrence Gutfull is a moron.
@peterbakernyt @PressSec In other words, Trump failed..... again.
@murpharoo @Cobra1A Was she the best candidate or just the best known candidate? Morrison is more about good publicity than making good decisions.
@NoahCRothman He should meet Jong Un in the Philippines next. Because he’s acting like a Manila Folder.
@swiminwthsharks @BarnsGreg He can walk out any time he wants.
@Acosta Only a fool would believe that. Speaking of which, what is Trump saying?
@troycayden15 @CheriJacobus @IvankaTrump Stay in St Petersburg Russia please.

@thewollemipine @cheryl_kernot The mad monk is a 2 Kings 2:23-24 kinda guy.
@mattgaetz @rigel2020 Someone dodged a bullet then!
@thewollemipine @cheryl_kernot Their true colours are shining through. Adherence to their outdated views on how society used to be and should be now, are more important than any justice and acknowledgement of pain caused by these pariahs.
@cheryl_kernot @thewollemipine As long as the conversation is good and matches Johnny’s narrative, who cares about the kids!
@9NewsAUS @michaelbesty Any words for the victims?
@michaelkoziol @cheryl_kernot Is he talking about the Liberals pre-selection for Hughes?
@JoelBrennecke @elonmusk @TitusNation That would be scathing ....... if you injected some vitriol into it.
@TopBloke13 @MomentsAU Said he still feels the same way about Pell in spite of the charge of which he was found guilty.
@Berts46ers @smh @michaelkoziol He will have had a long time to reconcile this. He’s still friends tho I notice.
@mattgaetz You’ll be in the turps tonight. Someone grab his car keys off him. Ol’ 7up will be ‘emotional’!

@SMadden56 @GarthGodsman @HumanHeadline @mirandadevine Garth is a 2 Kings 2:23-24 kinda guy.
@HillReporter The idiot is trying to be the new Roger Stone. He might succeed too. Because they’re both fuckwits.
@JamesKosur Do it , do it, DO IT!
@GarthGodsman @HumanHeadline @mirandadevine Nope. You’re the one in denial. What 6 minutes? Why not the more common 5 mins? Why not under 30seconds? Why the specific number of minutes? He’s guilty, a jury of 12 have convicted that pedophile. Now his enablers are out to make it seem not such a crime.
@GarthGodsman @HumanHeadline @mirandadevine A plain vanilla sexual penetration!!! What the hell is wrong with you lot? Do you think sexual assault of a child can be described away by calling it a plain vanilla sexual penetration and that it should be allowed? Seems you do.
@GarthGodsman @HumanHeadline @mirandadevine ‘A plain vanilla sexual penetration’!!! What are your thoughts on that admission by Richter?
@GarthGodsman @HumanHeadline @mirandadevine 6 minutes.... lower end of the scale. That’s an admission of Pell’s criminal actions. It’s goodnight Irene.
@Redistrict Then they should make the most of their primary win, because their November election will be some form of hell for a lot of them.
@GarthGodsman @HumanHeadline @mirandadevine How do you feel about Pell’s lawyers admitting his guilt today in court? Apparently because the offending was under 6 minutes, it’s at the lower end of the scale.... APPARENTLY!!! Want to reconsider your opinion now?
@dailytelegraph @mirandadevine Cough 6 minutes of offending cough
@Bolt_RSS His lawyer has admitted his offending in court today. Richter said his offending was at the lower end of the scale because it was under 6 minutes! How do you feel about him now?
@BetootaAdvocate @rohan_connolly By evidence, Rotten Johnny means that the offence has to be at least 6 plus minutes in duration. Anything under 6 minutes isn’t considered an offence.
@AP That’s 2% of her estimated wealth. She should survive this setback. But it will be a struggle.
@krassenstein When is that moron going to be charged with fraud?
@0bservator @VicRoads @DanielAndrewsMP Thanks. I was just searching for where the works were up to as I’m heading that way tomorrow morning. So it’s obviously not finished. Hard to get any info off the net as per status.
@rhysam 6 minute ‘offender’
@Satposts @Thomo_Grant He’s probably suffering misplaced guilt or shame because of the actions of a predator. They can only be told they have all the support needed, but for some it will never be enough to protect them from public scrutiny and maybe even more self perceived shame.
@HumanHeadline What is a plain vanilla sexual penetration case other than rape in these circumstances? How delusional do you have to be to argue that?
@BruceHore @lenoretaylor I got the tongue in cheek loud and clear.
@BruceHore @lenoretaylor You know enough to know this is an admission of guilt. Does Bolt and Devine and and and and .....?
@Satposts @Thomo_Grant Go get ‘em.
@MelissaLDavey @SarahRubyWrites The bloke who was smashing the policeman’s head into the ground is now innocent because the assault was under the new 6 minute offence guideline.
@lenoretaylor If it’s less than 6 minutes of offending, then you apparently are innocent.
@Satposts @Thomo_Grant There’s nothing to agree with now. Pell’s lawyers this morning have stated his offending was at the lower end of the scale because it was under 6 minutes of offending!!
@HumanHeadline “Oh but but but .... errr ummm ....... it’s a left wing plot! “
@samstein I hope it was false and he has to compete in the marketplace of defamation court.
@hughriminton @PatsKarvelas I never knew the ABC argued court cases. This is a revelation to me. Do the state prosecutors even bother turning up when this happens?
@Satposts @Thomo_Grant I celebrate nothing about him. He’s a malevolent self promoter who would sell out anyone and lie to improve his position.
@Satposts @Thomo_Grant Evidence and law
@Ragmoppet @PaulaReidCBS @CBSThisMorning @CBSNews Are you performing at any comedy gigs any time soon?
@CamaronBrooks @AlanDersh Not one to side with Dershowitz, but his job for his scumbag client was to extricate the best deal he could. That’s his obligation as a lawyer. The onus falls on the prosecutor and judge to ensure procedure and protocols are adhered to.
@OliviaMesser I don’t doubt her claims. But I do have to question why she would work to elect that racist, misogynist clown in the first place.
@tomsteinfort He only wants certain types convicted.
@GoodeAmbrose @rebeccaballhaus @wstrobel Because we have heard one recording of Trump breaking the law in relation to payments. Hard to argue with evidence. What else does Cohen have?
@beels That’s his ‘spray tan’ pose
@Thomo_Grant I read the article. For someone who wasn’t in court for most probably any of the case, he seems to have a lot of ideas about the veracity or lack there of, of the evidence. Bolt’s stance was made up well in advance in spite of what the verdict was going to be.
@jablocks @9NewsMelb It’s got nothing to do with Andrews. The judiciary are completely independent. The government has given them to power to deny bail, it’s up to the magistrates to be more in tune with community expectations.

@SeanSailorx @business @bopinion I live in a state where the world’s largest deposit of brown coal exists. They have been mining it for 100 plus years and haven’t even touched 1/2 of 1% of known deposits. And it’s all open cut mining so cheaply mined. Still can’t compete against renewables.
@SeanSailorx @business @bopinion They are here. But it’s a losing battle for them. Wind farms are going up left right and centre.
@SkyNewsAust @SkyNewsRicho It’s about 400km west of Mackay. Now what?
@SeanSailorx @business @bopinion The market will dictate what’s the better power production sources, not governments catering to coal producers.
@SeanSailorx @business @bopinion Australia is adding wind farms all the time and government is giving rebates on domestic solar installations. It’s a slow takeover happening here.
@Dax_x98 Nah. If they’re idiots, I just call them fucking idiots no matter what colour they are.
@smerconish @corvowine @CNN By keeping prostitution illegal, you create this industry of sex and people trafficking. Legislate to create government supervision over the industry will go some way to solve these issues. Because the Industry isn’t going to go away.

@staffo_sez @cheryl_kernot I want to know what blonks prefer Morrison after his disastrous, inept, tone deaf tenure?

@AusLoafer @MikeCarlton01 Apparently all expenses will be paid!
@Lady_Star_Gem It will end up being a female candidate, maybe even a female running mate. And take it to the bank, they will be asked the most inane questions about work and family balance and all that crap that they’ve had to deal with well before anyway.
@PreeceKim @9NewsMelb @LanaMurphy I’m pretty sure you don’t know the rules regarding unholstering a weapon. And by the time he was in this situation it was probably too late to do that. You seem to think all his opportunities are in isolation. It’s not a TV crime show.
@tribelaw Not to worry. A certain Rachel Maddow doesn’t let us forget.
@T_S_P_O_O_K_Y @lidp23 @RobertMosesIII @TheRickWilson @RadioFreeTom @DNC You seem to think about men a lot.
@IndivisibleNet @realDonaldTrump Yep.... that’s a sex predator
@PreeceKim @9NewsMelb @LanaMurphy Do you think that carrying a gun makes their use at every instance convenient? If the circumstances here availed him more space and he still felt threatened, he may have been able to unholster it.
@PreeceKim @9NewsMelb @LanaMurphy When you’re being manhandled that way, you’re more intent on using your hands to protect yourself.

@RadioFreeTom If we call him a moron, we are ensuring that the concept of royalty and the privilege of power is well and truly diminished. Can’t be too sure in these things.
@RadioFreeTom The office might demand respect, but the current occupant doesn’t. So we are free to define him as we please. The respect for the office isn’t diminished at all by people exercising their 1st A rights. In fact it shows the constitution is working as it should in this instance.
How good is Ellyse Perry!!!
@yashar No we won’t, yes we will.
@RadioFreeTom You can choose to honour him or anyone with whatever title you choose. I choose to allocate the appropriate name according to their character. The 1st A is a wonderful thing.

@zaptrapped @hardhouz13 He will challenge that all the way to the SC.
@TheRynheart Obviously need more Russian influence.
@DWStweets @Kris_Sacrebleu He swamped the drain.
@emptywheel Mueller’s probably saying ‘thanks for the clue’
@smilon713 @brianschatz Tidal.
@webster So jihadists can serve a purpose!
@chrislhayes ‘Good on both sides’ seems to be a common theme with this administration.
@AJA_Cortes Lol. You’re taking the piss aren’t you? I hope for your sake that your extracting the urine. Because if you’re not taking the piss, you’ll be copping shit from here to breakfast time.
@MSNBC So she can adapt!
@Helenhs @MSNBC @maddow His deploron base don’t watch her, so they’re not really being affected by her dismantling of him.
@AndrewLamingMP @QLDLabor That’s no way to describe LNP voters!
@abcnews Sentence him as if he assaulted an human.
@MikeCarlton01 @cheryl_kernot They could all fit into his proposed urinal.
@hughriminton @Cobra1A Huawei is my guess
@Species1951 @Farquetoo @billshortenmp Oh dear!!
@Species1951 @Tigerfan05a @billshortenmp Then I’m not talking to you!
@Species1951 @Farquetoo @billshortenmp I think the audience may be lacking. That’s the issue here.
@Species1951 @Farquetoo @billshortenmp You need a sarcasm injection.
@Species1951 @Tigerfan05a @billshortenmp Is your name Mick?
@Species1951 @Farquetoo @billshortenmp This is a public forum. Stop feeling yourself.
@Species1951 @Tigerfan05a @billshortenmp No problems. I believe charity work is important.
@Tigerfan05a @Species1951 @billshortenmp Which part of convictions don’t you understand? I typed that slowly for you, just in case you have trouble comprehending. You can thank me later.
@Species1951 @Tigerfan05a @billshortenmp Thanks for that. You passed the first test.
@Species1951 @Farquetoo @billshortenmp You’ve taken all this to heart. Bill has triggered you. Take a bex and let me know how you’re feeling tomorrow.
@Tigerfan05a @Species1951 @billshortenmp You seem to think I give a fuck about your accusations. Come to me with convictions and I’ll have a look
@MichaelPascoe01 @cheryl_kernot May is approaching fast.
@Tigerfan05a @Species1951 @billshortenmp You better ring ASIO, that’s sounds serious.
@Species1951 @Farquetoo @billshortenmp Lol. I’m not the one talking about angels. Lol. You seem to be very invested in defending Moronison’s reputation. Imagine the angst you’ll be experiencing in May. Do you have ambulance cover? Hey man!!!
@Species1951 @Farquetoo @billshortenmp No one is an angel. I don’t believe in angels. Maybe that’s your problem..... you fantasise too much.
@Species1951 @billshortenmp Moronison’s are real ‘quality’ the happy clapper is either inept or a sinner of the greatest magnitude. I’m guessing it’s a mixture of both.
@RichardTuffin @cheryl_kernot This May, L will mean losers.
@Stonekettle She’s a walking hate crime.
@Farquetoo @Species1951 @billshortenmp Lol. I’m sure YOU need to believe that.
@Species1951 @billshortenmp It would take Shorten years to accumulate the number of sins that Moronison has in 6 months.
@yesmsg @Truthntranspare @jaketapper So what you’re saying is that you want all lawyers to be ethical lawyers! Lol. Yeah .... nah.... that ain’t going to happen
@billshortenmp I’m waiting for Morrison to one day yell out ‘what about Hilary’s emails’!
@LuluLemew Who would find it hard to believe that a decade or more ago, that Trump never availed himself of these ‘services’? Who would find it hard to believe that a decade or more ago, Trump wouldn’t have been agreeable to Epstein’s more illegal type activities?
@Truthntranspare @jaketapper Starr wouldn’t be exposed legally here. His job is to do the best he can for his client,  no matter how much a scumbag that client is. It’s up to the prosecutor and the the judge to ensure procedure and protocols are followed.
@RadioFreeTom It’s always interesting to have a history lesson. I don’t have an issue with it. It’s long winded for some but there’s always the option of recording it and fast forwarding it.
@HoarseWisperer @AlanDersh @TrueFactsStated Keeping his clothes on would help.
@AlanDersh @TrueFactsStated Womp WOMP
@Tom_Winter I bet it was a hell of a lot more than 30.
@WalshFreedom It’s all colour dependent.
@realDonaldTrump The 5G rollout won’t be as good as people believe for quite some time. Download speeds won’t be much above 4G for a year or so.
@AsteadWesley The one blowing raspberries summed it up perfectly.
@AnnCoulter You’re a walking hate crime.
@WalshFreedom People have watched too much Law and Order and think everything gets sorted in a one hour précis
@WalshFreedom $15 is a good place to start. Let’s see the impact on consumer spending with that. We know lower income earners will spend a greater % than those with wealth. Flow up economics is a far better proposition.
@jpcenzato @Cobra1A Out of shape reptiles..... yeah, I’m not disagreeing.
@USMCLiberal Once they have the data they just cycle thru searches of key words and names etc. it’s not hard to find key evidence from data these days.
@seanhannity So the current systems of border protection is working. No one is going to try and walk that amount over the border. It’s going to come in vehicles that have no choice but go thru border control areas.
@atrupar A bit heavy on the orange tang today Donny!
@PhilippeReines I’m all for a painful prolonged death to Trump. He’s not going to to be kicked out of the White House before Jan 2021, so the more uncomfortable his tenure is, at least we get to see him suffer.
@barriecassidy Helloworld, goodbye Libs!
@TrueFactsStated That’s it!!! He’s gone!
@fras99 Too much holy spirits.
@jwheels74 @smilon713 @InsideEdition Tsk tsk tsk...... someone needs a lawyer real soon.
@esdavis @PalmerReport That’s because of rusted on Berners with a bone to pick. He didn’t beat an unpopular Clinton, lost by 3 million primary votes. He won’t be winning this one either.
@pdacosta @NatashaBertrand Remembering that it was reported in December that Mueller’s report would be finalised by mid February.
@10NewsFirst @davidicke When they both make a point!!!
@Lannwhaley @williamlegate @realDonaldTrump You don’t look like you save anything.
@JeffreyGuterman He never gets those eyes right!!!
@Lannwhaley @williamlegate @realDonaldTrump I hope you go inspect it up close then.
@SenatorCollins Collins makes public statement supporting Coats. Coats gets sacked, Collins will support Trump’s move. We’ve seen it all before.
@chrislhayes He needs to smoke a spliff and lighten up. It’s her heritage too and she can joke about it as she pleases.
@joshtpm It was touted in media reports before Christmas that his report would be finalised by mid February.
@GCobber99 Maybe he meant vapid.
@nadabakos It will get out somehow. These things are never contained fully. It might be in dribs and drabs which will act like a death of a thousand cuts.
@Ferchu_Granados @washingtonpost My guess a trailer is involved somewhere. Trailers are caravans, right?
@TheRickWilson Anyone with a reciprocal saw? Anyone?
@SamLandsberger You can only hope.
@smh @tonyowright We will stand them down .
@AustralianLabor @Cobra1A If only Moronison had another question time to mess around with to avoid the hard questions.
@com_gerra @australian Everyone knows Trump is a moron. It’s not being hidden.
@australian I’m sure we will survive his criticism.
@GWillicker8 @extinctionlife @BBCWorld Bovinity
@RepMattGaetz @NRA Matt ‘Hiccups’ Gaetz
@thedailybeast She doesn’t even qualify as high as a lightweight.
@TrueFactsStated A chance!
@Loud_Lass ‘Look.... I’m a dick!’
@AriMelber Nup. Bad TV. He’s a liar with a malevolent agenda.
@MaraGay Consider yourself lucky.
@Harlan You poor darling.
@TheRickWilson Neither will be in the running come the Dems convention.
@Strandjunker @realDonaldTrump Die in jail
@hughriminton A Queensland cop calling someone a liar! Oh the irony.
@9NewsAUS It just gets worse and worse with these clowns.
@GoAngelo @williamlegate When she’s president, he will be able to admire her a lot more.
@murpharoo When she chooses.
@samanthamaiden @GetUp From a lightweight
@Matt_R_Golf @murpharoo I’d sprint from Melbourne to see Penny Wong take on Cash in a verbal joust.
@lindareynoldswa @AusBorderForce What a load of frogshit. Moronison declared Christmas Island open, he’s the one that says there’s now a place for boat people again, not that they actually stopped coming. The lies you lot will tell!!!
@CipherKnot @Nick_Offerman Tassie is a pretty cool place. Best fresh food you’ll find anywhere I reckon.
@thistallawkgirl Her bump stock working overtime.
@Mimirocah1 I think he wants to martyr himself to coerce a quicker pardon than he thinks might be coming.
@fleaosi @9NewsSyd @9NewsAUS @RuthWW I guess you do whatever it takes to remain safe. But it’s what you tell the police after that can determine your fate. Usually it’s about immediately stopping use of force once you realise they pose no further threat.
@murpharoo I bet he didn’t forget to go on the holiday.
@RWPUSA He needs an international distraction for the media so his domestic issues are less publicised.
@AmandiOnAir I can see that happening.
@rmayemsinger Go figure!
@RMac18 @joncoopertweets He’s cactus!
@AriMelber @EricBoehlert 30 years ago. AOC was born since then and now is in Congress. That’s how old a reference they are.
@kylegriffin1 You’d think Texas would be considering this because of all the private land owners that will be affected. Most probably republican supporting landowners. Very very upset republican supporting landowners!!!
@yashar @RitaPanahi The only dangers are if they try and strangle you or scare you to death. Other than that, it’s the tiger snakes and various brown snakes that you need to worry about.
@Mediaite They always want someone arrested. They never nominate the law they’ve breached, only that their sensitivities have been impaired!
@fleaosi @9NewsSyd @9NewsAUS @RuthWW Because if the authorities doubt your intentions they may argue unreasonable force for something that can be replaced and or is insured. Personal safety is harder to argue against because they can’t measure your fears at the time.
@BethCoyne3 @williamlegate @izadaisy1 @JohnHookfox10 @sxdoc @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Killed it by 3 million less votes.
@oneunderscore__ Drinks his own bathwater
@Simpsioni @KNayyeh And on a burger as well!!! Glorious!
@Simpsioni @KNayyeh At the end of the day, it’s what YOU like to eat. Like pineapple on an Hawaiian pizza..... fantastic. But Americans just can’t cop to it.
@Simpsioni @KNayyeh The best https://t.co/NCdqOmtYZn
@Simpsioni @KNayyeh Nope, I’m making an Australian Hamburger. A taste sensation and messy as hell!
@KNayyeh The perfect hamburger has beetroot, tomato sliced, cheese slice, onion, lettuce, bacon, tomato sauce on the patty, thinly sliced pickle, a fried but just runny egg and a relish directly onto a buttered and toasted bun.
@realDonaldTrump @NBCNews It’s a good thing Mueller is in the case. He’s finding lots of things to do with Russia and people that were in your immediate hemisphere. You should be thankful.
@DailyMail @MailOnline I hope she enjoyed it.
@tribelaw For years I’ve heard American political commentators talk about America being a successful experiment. It’s not, it’s flawed and it’s systems are now being found out where they fail. For Trump to remain in the White House this long, with his record is a failure on all counts.
@paigecardona Someone needs to buy that family a TV.
@deemadigan Abbott levels and maybe beyond. They’re very tolerant of incompetence in the coalition. It’s almost a badge of honour.....
@kimguilfoyle Maybe he was he looking at a photo of the Trumps including yourself!
@DearAuntCrabby @cryborg Her best Lady Penelope impression from The Thunderbirds
@TommyJHughes1 @DanWaltonAWU @DanielAndrewsMP I haven’t heard anyone say it’s ok. One doesn’t make the other any better. If the LNP complained about the Vic ALP’s tactics, then they too should stand condemned.
@LeeHenHen Flaps up!
@KyungLahCNN @KamalaHarris Trump estimates this crowd at 200 people.
@south_corey @williamlegate @realDonaldTrump Doh!
@briantylercohen @BeSeriousUSA That was funnier than the mildly amusing Baldwin skit.
@joshscampbell @realDonaldTrump It wasn’t all that funny. The indignation from Trump and his sycophants....... now that’s funny.
@psychdr100 I envision a circle where everyone is pointing at someone else in that circle.
@ABC When his words cut you like a wet bus ticket.
@Loud_Lass Just waitin’ for a boat.
@ceelle1 @TitusNation I don’t think the Russians give up so much as just alter course to suit the current climate. Gabbard being an interesting case of how much Ru assistance will she receive because she potentially is a spoiler in the Dems race.
@CandaceTX So, I wonder what the lawsuit will end up awarding the boy? Because this is a 1stA violation of the worst kind x10
@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump Has the Xanax run out in Stepford?
@realDonaldTrump Prune juice not working yet?
@Juan_de_Vashon @DanteAtkins @HowardSchultz You’re the one with an obsession on Schulz. It’s a completely different situation. He’s not aligned or trying to be aligned with the Dems. Sanders is trying to ride on their coattails.
@Juan_de_Vashon @DanteAtkins @HowardSchultz @GOP I couldn’t give a rats arse about Schultz he will shit out way before the Nov 2020 election.
@Juan_de_Vashon @DanteAtkins @HowardSchultz He’s running as an independent which is his prerogative and not using the resources of the Dems.
@michellegrattan @Cobra1A They want to win an election, not aggravate a whole electorate.
@rohan_connolly @aflwomens Depends who you support. Anyone playing Collingwood..... yes.
@9NewsSyd @9NewsAUS @RuthWW Always remember: I used the minimum amount of force I thought necessary to ensure the safety of myself and my family. Don’t mention protecting property.
@TimOBrien He gets them from one source.... he pulls them out of his arse.
@rollercaste @kawaii433 @WalshFreedom @CNN @MSNBC Seems to me that you’re secretly wanting one to occur.
@rollercaste @kawaii433 @WalshFreedom @CNN @MSNBC I don’t recall a lot of crimes they have laws against. Do you want to wait until the next one to occur before they do something?
@newscomauHQ Good thing Barb wasn’t anywhere near him.
@rollercaste @kawaii433 @WalshFreedom @CNN @MSNBC It’s not a federal hate crime. With that status, the repercussions are a lot more severe.
@rollercaste @kawaii433 @WalshFreedom @CNN @MSNBC Any lynching. They’ve been trying to introduce anti lynching legislation for quite some time. You seem to have a fondness for it not to be introduced.
@rollercaste @kawaii433 @WalshFreedom @CNN @MSNBC Do you want lynching to continue?
@DuvalNajera @daejaun19 @Scaramucci @Ron_Christie @AOC You seem to be very interested in how men relate to each other. Are you projecting and don’t want to come outright and say it? I support you in your alternative lifestyle. Is Trump Putin’s Cuck? Is that what it means?
@australian Moronison has invited people smugglers to ramp up their operations by saying they now have a place to stay.
@daejaun19 @DuvalNajera @Scaramucci @Ron_Christie @AOC He’d be lucky to explain socialism, let alone anything else.
@CascadiaForever @DanteAtkins I wasn’t asking for your input. I tolerated it, but it wasn’t essential to me to have your approval. Feel free to hold the same for my opinion.
@CascadiaForever @DanteAtkins Snark is an opinion. Show me where I’m not allowed to hold this view.
@CascadiaForever @DanteAtkins Not really. Am I required to be bothered? Or am I free not to be bothered?
@oldtoolhound @kawaii433 @WalshFreedom @CNN @MSNBC This is my thread. I made a comment to Walsh and the 5 people have joined in.
@JenniferJJacobs @nwadhams Not after she nominated Germany as an ally in WW2? Really?
@DanteAtkins So he gets to avail himself of Democrat infrastructure but not commit to the party unless it aligns with his political ambitions?
@DanteAtkins Has Sanders joined the Dems?
@NightlyPolitics Peroxided chump.
@bird_gang18 @kawaii433 @WalshFreedom @CNN @MSNBC My oh my..... the canary is angry!!!
@bird_gang18 @kawaii433 @WalshFreedom @CNN @MSNBC Go see a doctor. I’m not here for your health problem.
@oldtoolhound @kawaii433 @WalshFreedom @CNN @MSNBC FFS!! Which part of MSNBC don’t you understand? I never commented on any other news org. He said MSNBC and CNN and I commented on MSNBC. I can’t type it any slower to make you understand better!
@neal_katyal @cryborg Looking for an new job Monday.
@siano2020 Embittered shrew.
@bird_gang18 @kawaii433 @WalshFreedom @CNN @MSNBC And ‘bro’ is ..... 5th grade stuff. Grow up.
@bird_gang18 @kawaii433 @WalshFreedom @CNN @MSNBC I have to tailor my message to suit the audience (that being you) so if it makes zero sense, it’s a reflection of ..... well, dare I say it..... YOU!
@bird_gang18 @kawaii433 @WalshFreedom @CNN @MSNBC I said 62 million deplorons. When you surpass that level of mass stupidity, get back to me. But it’s got to outnumber 62 million. Otherwise I will just keep referring you to 62 mill and his lies.
@madmaxrobes @DanteAtkins @daveweigel Surrounded by big water!! Who knew?
@SamSykesSwears @yashar Change the name to ‘Prone’ and continue on.
@bird_gang18 @kawaii433 @WalshFreedom @CNN @MSNBC Is that like 62 million fuckwits believed Trump?
@kawaii433 @bird_gang18 @WalshFreedom @CNN @MSNBC His sycophancy to ill douchè is admirable!
@Zopai @JenniferJJacobs His one v 8000.... got a long way to go yet. He might get there.... but orange shitstain is ahead by the length of the straight.
@bird_gang18 @kawaii433 @WalshFreedom @CNN @MSNBC He’s winning the lying prick stakes. When someone else overtakes him, I’ll use them as the default.
@ktumulty @nycsouthpaw @PeteButtigieg V day 1945 has a lot to answer for!
@BishesBrew @MaxBoot That’s why I mentioned him.
@JuliaDavisNews Eggs Benedict Arnold
@bird_gang18 @kawaii433 @WalshFreedom @CNN @MSNBC A better example would be one of Fox News accepting all of Trump’s 8000 lies.
@MaxBoot Roger Ailes. He couldn’t be any worse than Nuaert.
@Zopai @JenniferJJacobs Trump thinks there’s only 2. Rich and poor.
@Independent @williamlegate That’s just going to get stolen!
@Mrsbluehills @kawaii433 @WalshFreedom @CNN @MSNBC It was in the media, but I’m referring to MSNBC. Maybe you have rocks in your eyes and can’t read!!!
@tonyposnanski @realDonaldTrump He was having Eggs Benedict Arnold if you don’t mind!
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Does this mean WW2 Germany has been relegated from ally to foe again?
@kawaii433 @WalshFreedom @CNN @MSNBC It’s almost as if they think this alleged dishonesty makes all homophobic attack not believable now.
@gtconway3d Eggs Benedict Arnold
@meridithmcgraw He’s not long for that role now!!!
@WalshFreedom @CNN @MSNBC I never heard it mentioned on MSNBC. Maybe it was, but I listen to it a lot.... a real lot.
@brithume Jealous?
@ryanjreilly @PreetBharara Plead.... It’s typical phonetical laziness. Force the reader to use their interpretive skills whilst reading.
@MollyJongFast Who wears a cap inside?
@JenniferJJacobs She’s just found out that the US and Germany weren’t allies in WW2 and it’s going to take a while to digest that.
@realDonaldTrump At the omelette bar?
@MaxBoot I heard the sound of a handbrake being applied........ and deathly silence. (pun intended)
@ursusmiratus On the contrary, I think there’s a lot of room in that head.....a lot
@thehill 19.5 should do it then.
@smh @clairekimball He’s a fair dinkum liar.
@yashar The concept of royalty is a disgrace in this day and age. But this family is taking it to new depths.
@PhilippeReines I don’t read any nonsense about overturning 2016 anymore. Hopefully that nonsense is well behind us. It’s the Pelosi becoming Pres that is the current annoyance. It JUST WONT HAPPEN!
@daverburgess @thehill Lol..... oh, you’re one of those types. When someone says ‘boo’ do you shit yourself and blame the CIA?
@daverburgess @thehill Gabbard is a Russian flunky, it’s a reasonable assumption that any Gabbard supporter is a product of the same GRU St Petersburg bot factory that got agent orange elected.
@mtracey @CharlesPPierce Do you think this is the first time these agencies haven’t questioned the fitness of a person? They did it with Reagan. Presidents are under constant evaluating agencies. You might not like it, but it’s their job to ensure these clowns aren’t acting against the constitution too.
@MaxBoot Arguably, every day he does something to erode the norms of democracy. This is just one in a multitude of protocols he has and will continue to shatter.
@SenMikeLee Your initial assessment is complete garbage. Trying to hide your sycophancy with that second timid sentence isn’t working. The constitution hasn’t changed.
@Marmel I said a long time ago..... hit their wallets and they will turn and turn hard against him.
@greg_207 @Cobra1A @ScottMorrisonMP @PeterDutton_MP Facts don’t elude them. They are relying on people being ignorant of what the new legislation does. They are  relying on their lies working. Hopefully enough have been paying attention.
@daverburgess @thehill BTW, I know you’re American centric, I was referring to the old Leningrad/ St Petersburg. But of course you knew that..... or didn’t. So, you have a little experience outside of your cocoon. One day gramps, you might experience more. One day....
@MalcolmNance @cryborg Money.... it always boils down to money with Trump. That’s the only things that he measures shame and pride by.
@daverburgess @thehill I would know more about geographical locations in this world than you would. Have you actually ventured beyond the shores of mainland America? Or you get your ‘worldliness’ from TV?
@sclark_melbs @InsidersABC Undermining leadership just doesn’t happen on its own. He needs Sundays to coordinate the masses away from the gaze of the rest of the Libs.
@daverburgess @thehill The main part. Makes sense.
@daverburgess @thehill A Gabbard supporter! Which part of St Petersburg do you reside?
@daverburgess @thehill I’ll choose whatever words I want. A malignant force is malignant.
@thehill Getting closer to Agent Orange.
@Scaramucci @Ron_Christie @AOC She doesn’t make decisions that affect Amazon. Don’t overstate her impact on NY state politics.
@CBSNews I thought Trump said he didn’t drink alcohol.
@MalcolmNance The right wing has gone cra cra.
@funder No executive privilege either.
@kenolin1 A vacant head.
@guardiannews I hope she lied her arse off. And I hope Mueller can prove she did.
@jemelehill He should be on a list, but he’s not a starting QB given how he performed in his last few seasons.
@kylegriffin1 When you’re right... you’re right!
@nickiknowsnada @ManchuCandidate That’s a shame.
@smh How can anyone resist the urge to belt out ‘girt’ when it comes around?
@grantstern @JuddApatow @OccupyDemocrats It’s good that he won this case, but let’s not overstate his value as a QB. His last few seasons were unremarkable at best. He may have warranted being on a list now as a backup QB, all things being equal.
@AlanDersh Well, we know he’s a moron, so psychiatrically he’s definitely incapacitated. Let’s 25A the orange shitstain.
@Kari48876688 @iamAtheistGirl Do you claim your god is omnipotent and omnipresent?
@Kari48876688 @iamAtheistGirl I choose the logical choice..... none.
@Kari48876688 @iamAtheistGirl Which god? There are at least 4000.
@JeannieG40 Situation normal as I call it.
@Newsweek Grind him into the dirt.
@AnnCoulter Don’t be so hard on yourself. We can do that for you.
@davereaboi @TuckerCarlson No, Fox is full of presenters telling porky lies in deference to their overlord the orange shitstain. Carlson is only essential viewing when constipation has afflicted you....... for days.
@TitusNation It will come out how many GOP congressionals and maybe a fair chunk of Dems too are heavily into Russian campaign money.
@JoyAnnReid @maddow A thorough search for their collective spines would need to be undertaken prior to the improbable chance of this happening.
@Dax_x98 That worked out well for him.
@dominowski @TheRickWilson He must hate that photo.
@mschlapp @PuestoLoco He won’t be gone until the report is finalised or his part in the report is finished.
@EternalQuest27 @TweeTLeDaMe @MaxBoot @IlhanMN @CFR_org Yawn, wake me when you have something to say.
@EternalQuest27 @TweeTLeDaMe @MaxBoot @IlhanMN @CFR_org When you have nothing to argue, go to the GIFS.
@EternalQuest27 @TweeTLeDaMe @MaxBoot @IlhanMN @CFR_org I’m amused.
@EternalQuest27 @TweeTLeDaMe @MaxBoot @IlhanMN @CFR_org Fucking swearing is my 1st A right. Are you against the 1st A!
@EternalQuest27 @TweeTLeDaMe @MaxBoot @IlhanMN @CFR_org Cheated on every missus he’s had. He’s a sexual assaulter at heart. He can’t help himself. You better be careful, he’ll be grabbing you coz you’re a pussy too!!!
@EternalQuest27 @TweeTLeDaMe @MaxBoot @IlhanMN @CFR_org You seem to have taken this all personally. Lol.
@TweeTLeDaMe @EternalQuest27 @MaxBoot @IlhanMN @CFR_org Snowflake alert pt 2. You poor darling!!
@TweeTLeDaMe @EternalQuest27 @MaxBoot @IlhanMN @CFR_org Lol. The old doctored audio. Like the pussy tape..... admits it, then a few years later says it’s doctored.... lol. What a fucking pisser...
@EternalQuest27 @TweeTLeDaMe @MaxBoot @IlhanMN @CFR_org Snowflake alert.
@EternalQuest27 @TweeTLeDaMe @MaxBoot @IlhanMN @CFR_org January 2021, when he inevitably loses and is out of the White House, a flood of sealed indictments will all of a sudden become unsealed. Take it to the bank.
@TweeTLeDaMe @EternalQuest27 @MaxBoot @IlhanMN @CFR_org Lol. Federal court is about as real as it comes. Grow up and come up with something more original than fake news. You deploron cunts are hilarious.
@EternalQuest27 @TweeTLeDaMe @MaxBoot @IlhanMN @CFR_org On the contrary, I find this the best entertainment going around. I’m loving his obvious discomfort and need to lie every public statement he makes. But there comes a time when you gotta pay the piper. And when his fall comes..... it will come hard.
@EternalQuest27 @TweeTLeDaMe @MaxBoot @IlhanMN @CFR_org Lol. Struggling again. What we do know and have on tape is Trump conspiring with Cohen to pay off women and it was in part why Cohen was convicted. And Trump has tried to sell the lie that it was a private matter. He’s gone!!!
@TweeTLeDaMe @EternalQuest27 @MaxBoot @IlhanMN @CFR_org Because Cohen has publicly stated that Individual 1 nominated in court as his co conspirator in criminal campaign violations is Trump. That’s how we know this.
@EternalQuest27 @TweeTLeDaMe @MaxBoot @IlhanMN @CFR_org Obstruction of justice. Russian collusion charges from what is available to the public are still tenuous at best. But we already know he is a co conspirator with Cohen over campaign violations and that was confirmed by a federal judge.
@EternalQuest27 @TweeTLeDaMe @MaxBoot @IlhanMN @CFR_org I don’t have to say what he’s guilty of, he’s under investigation and those around him are ending up pleading guilty. When the investigation is over, we can all say what he is or isn’t going to be charged with. Now.... what specific charges are you going to charge HRC with?
@EternalQuest27 @TweeTLeDaMe @MaxBoot @IlhanMN @CFR_org You’re struggling if that’s your argument. Trump is in the firing line and HRC isn’t. And then there are the state charges looming from NY as a nice little welcome when he loses in 2020.
@DarlaShine Studies by idiots like Wakefield. You’re wrong and this is endangering children and people who have autoimmune issues and who can’t receive vaccinations. You should be ashamed of yourself.... but of course you don’t have that level of understanding.
@Phil_Mattingly How much of his wall will get built in less than 2 years? Not much. All this is is shallow symbolism from the moron.
@EternalQuest27 @TweeTLeDaMe @MaxBoot @IlhanMN @CFR_org We shall see. But what we do know is that after 25 years, not one charge has landed on HRC. So in the current climate, Trump is under investigation and many around him charged. HRC has survived 25 years of it and is not under investigation.
@WalshFreedom @RandPaul @tedcruz @SenMikeLee @BenSasse Very hard to stand up for anything without a spine.
@kimmurphy100 @DonaldJTrumpJr @JordanSchachtel Or the lake....
@EternalQuest27 @TweeTLeDaMe @MaxBoot @IlhanMN @CFR_org One may ask the same about HRC. 25 years of being investigated by over zealous GOP run investigators, not one charge. Incompetence or innocence..... you choose.
@9NewsAUS Weak as piss.
@TweeTLeDaMe @MaxBoot @IlhanMN @CFR_org Watching Trump’s conviction?
@Independent Needs some ruff justice.
@PatsKarvelas Just getting into the Passover spirit early.

@ACorollaries @thehill That was Laura Ingraham
@SkyNewsAust @nyunggai That’s funny, I can’t see the fresh lobotomy scars on Mundine!
@MaxBoot @IlhanMN @CFR_org Not disgraceful. Justified given his lying to Congress. Maybe he should have thought of the damage to his reputation decades ago.
@DonaldJTrumpJr To be clear, you lied to congress about Russia. We know how this ends.
@ABC Members were teed off with all the damage to the course.
@AdamParkhomenko Cafe lattes only for Howie.

@DevonBroeske @joshscampbell @TrueFactsStated It’s too traumatic to talk about. Suffice to say, be careful what route you take.
@murpharoo Extending question time, shortening answer time.
@jaketapper @TheLeadCNN How did Trump refer to Chuck Todd once?
@maydaymindy9 They spent all the allotted plastic surgery money on daughter number 1.

@RadioFreeTom Meanwhile Hesgeth refuses to wash his hands of Trump’s collusion.
@JackPosobiec @DarlaShine The stupid moll wants kids to contract diseases that have the capacity kill others who can’t get vaccinated due to immunodeficiency issues. She’s a fucking idiot.

@libbycwatson @splinter_news Whatever lens you want to look at it, it needs to be sorted now rather than in October 2020 when it could help re-elect the moron in chief.
@AshaRangappa_ He actually does define the country because for all his overt corruption, the political process has taken 2 years to get nowhere in sanctioning him. Other properly functioning democracies would have dispensed with him by now.
@DonaldJTrumpJr On the contrary, they haven’t admitted any such thing. They are waiting on Mueller’s report before rushing to judgement. When is your indictment for lying to Congress coming?
@RadioFreeTom @TheRickWilson I assume it’s a ‘he’. ‘He’ has spent too much time coming up with this imagery for it not to be one of his fantasies.
@RWPUSA This is a period of vetting. And this is what vetting a candidate is all about. Better now than oct 2020.

@PatsKarvelas It’s almost as if Moronison is beckoning new boat arrivals. We know they actually haven’t stopped, they’re just not publicised. But now he’s giving them a place to come.

@deniseshrivell @Cobra1A Without doubt.
@JeffreyGuterman One whose main priority is for himself. Or in this case, whose only priority is for himself. Caring for another being is beyond the pale for someone like ill douchè.
@Melissa4Durack This legislation doesn’t change one thing with new boat arrivals. You know.... the new boat arrivals that the coalition doesn’t publicise because that would make their border policy look weak. You haven’t stopped the boats you’ve just hidden their arrival. You can’t trust the LNP
@khwalz @RadioFreeTom Tom is reverting to type. He’s getting nervous that the GOP are going to lose all 3 branches of government. He can’t countenance that, no matter his dislike of the moron in chief.

@10NewsFirst @Craig_Foster al Araibi was granted refugee status years ago because he faced political persecution, but Moronison thought it ok to potentially expose him for months to the same thing for which was was granted refugee status. He is inept.
@mayawiley @maggieNYT Too hard to imagine this atrocity.
@DaShanneStokes @GOP Because 60 million plus morons voted for him and an electoral system that’s broken. That’s how.
@JaradGarland @Craig_Foster @10NewsFirst @ScottMorrisonMP @MarisePayne @AusAmbBKK It must be debilitating being such a fucking moron!
@JaradGarland @Craig_Foster @10NewsFirst @ScottMorrisonMP @MarisePayne @AusAmbBKK Understand this simple concept. He was granted refugee status because of the political persecution he faced in Bahrain. This persecution potential hadn’t abated. So why sit there for 2 doing fuck all for months knowing his circumstances hadn’t changed?
@JaradGarland @Craig_Foster @10NewsFirst @ScottMorrisonMP @MarisePayne @AusAmbBKK Maybe if the government had acted 2 months ago, the Thai court would have done what they did today, back then. This government can’t win because it is inept. You got a happy clapper for PM who wouldn’t know his fucking arse from a hole in the ground.
@JaradGarland @Craig_Foster @10NewsFirst @ScottMorrisonMP @MarisePayne @AusAmbBKK The Thai court overturned the request for extradition upon pressure from the Aust Government. This pressure could have been applied any time since November. 2 months later they finally do something and look what happens.
@JaradGarland @Craig_Foster @10NewsFirst @ScottMorrisonMP @MarisePayne @AusAmbBKK What legislation needed to be changed? The international extradition laws have been settled for a long time. All this was, was Moronison showing no interest to start agitating for an outcome. He is as weak as piss.
@JaradGarland @Craig_Foster @10NewsFirst @ScottMorrisonMP @MarisePayne @AusAmbBKK Nup. As soon as he was locked up,the govt can start making representations. Moronison sat on his hands for months until the publicity became too loud to ignore. He is an absolute moron and weak as piss.
@Craig_Foster @10NewsFirst @ScottMorrisonMP @MarisePayne @AusAmbBKK This is great news....... but how many months could have been avoided if Morrison had acted with a degree of urgency earlier?
@williamlegate What a moron.

@SnydroA @ReneeLibby2 I’m not overly worried if someone sees me as inarticulate. I’m not in the business of trying to impress anyone with my communication skills.
@SnydroA @ReneeLibby2 Matt Whittaker isn’t. I see an observation of someone in politics as being articulate as no different as observing some sportspeople being athletic. It’s a positive quality that’s not always applicable to people in their chosen profession.
@SnydroA @ReneeLibby2 If I find someone articulate and their business is to articulate and be articulate, then I’m going to call it as I see it. Skin colour or gender has next to nothing to do with how their messaging resonates with me.
@SnydroA @ReneeLibby2 I don’t buy that premise. I’m not liking someone because they drive well, or are good at maths, when it comes to political dialogue and messaging, I am liking them for their ability to articulate a message.
@DailyMailUK @MailOnline You can be whatever you see yourself as. But you can’t tell me how I see you.

@LCNM99 @RollingStone If they’re only seeing it now, I have to question their intelligence.
@ReneeLibby2 Exactly. This inability to call a POC articulate or something that you makes them stand out from any and everyone else, is only going to alienate old white men like myself who want to be on their bandwagon. I like them because they are how describe them, not because I have to.

@SkyNewsAust @carolinemarcus We have it so good because of socialist programs such as Medicare and social welfare  and a progressive taxation system amongst other things.
@SkyNewsAust @RitaPanahi I wonder when Panahi used Medicare if she yells abuse at the government for providing a socialist service, or receives any government benefit at all. They are all socialist programs.
@RadioFreeTom @SchrodSnoFlake Socialism also includes government allocation of national resources to achieve social and political agendas. All  governments by definition have a degree of socialist practice.

@GirlNYC @davitydave @RyanHillMI @RepSwalwell Trump was always protected from DoJ prosecution by way of the DoJ rules. Trump’s time for justice if it is required will come once he vacates his position. It won’t come from the current congress as the Senate won’t vote to dismiss. And then there’s the State charges....
@JoyceWhiteVance Is that one of his gaffes that really isn’t a gaffe?
@davitydave @RyanHillMI @RepSwalwell I read that as either Whittaker himself gets to rule on whether the contempt charge for himself will go to a grand Jury or Pence chooses. Not much chance of it proceeding in either instance.

@thehill Ain’t going to happen.
@jllundqu @Mediaite Incorrect. The law in NY states that a ‘late term’ abortion determination must be made by a “health care practitioner licensed, certified, or authorized” under state law, “acting within his or her lawful scope of practice
@Delavegalaw @NicolleDWallace I’ve said for a while that he says what he has to say to get through ‘this’ moment and he will worry about the lie he has to tell for the ‘next’ moment when it happens.

@AP Maybe the janitor has a clean history!
@mkraju ‘No’ would have been easier to say.

@PeekMarc @Peggynoonannyc Projecting again. You seem to have a predilection for gay themes.
@Peggynoonannyc Has Trump offered you a cabinet position for which you’re ill qualified for (like the rest of his cabinet)? Your gushing over his incoherence isn’t doing you any favours. What other explanation could there be for your sycophancy?
@PeekMarc @Peggynoonannyc During a May 2016 Fox News appearance, Select Committee on Benghazi Chairman Trey Gowdy stated that U.S. troops would have been unable to reach four Americans killed at the American consulate in Libya in time to save lives.
@PeekMarc @Peggynoonannyc You seem to be the expert on this sort of imagery. Do go on.
@JohnJHarwood They want a large piece of Afghanistan.
@PeekMarc @Peggynoonannyc It was run by The GOP. If they’re incompetent or there was nothing to prosecute as Gowdy actually admitted, it’s their fault. But Mueller’s investigation isn’t going to shut down because you’re a sook and don’t like it. But sook away.... I enjoy reading it.
@PeekMarc @Peggynoonannyc Why? Whitewater took at least 4 years, Benghazi at least 3.... This isn’t even been 2 years yet and already 35 plus indictments. Keep it going, seems to be a lot of witches being found.
@Joe_Michaels @chrislhayes Lol. I’m sure you need me to be.
@Joe_Michaels @chrislhayes WELL we know he’s not.

@costareports @Lady_Star_Gem Can he stay there?
@mkraju @AOC Every country is socialist. All governments seek to use resources to meet their political agenda. It’s just a matter of how much they seek to do it that differs.
@ProgSocDem @ZerlinaMaxwell Bernie can cross the road for all I care. He won’t get the nomination. And the momentum for an anti Trump vote in 2020 will swamp any anti Democrat sentiment from Berners. But go your hardest, at least it will be worth the lols.

@RadioFreeTom Won’t matter. She won’t get the nomination. Too much baggage that Trump successfully ladened her with. That’s his one true superpower.
@NBCNews Probably the best speaker in American politics at the moment. It’s a good call.
@aflyingmonk3y @TexasLumpy @Redpainter1 @IvankaTrump Have you told Trump that? That’s his go to strategy in any discussion where he is countered.
@ZerlinaMaxwell Sort of makes you wonder if Bernie has a cell in St Petersburg
@KatelynLoveren @AriMelber Nah. That was Jeff Lord
@Brasilmagic Is it even a question?
@ZerlinaMaxwell His time has passed. It’s now a new generation that will be more effective in getting rid of this cancer occupying the White House. Harris is primed and ready and seemingythe perfect candidate to take on Trump. He can’t out argue her and her breadth of knowledge will swamp him.
@SRuhle @Oprah Harris has more of an established record of public service, but O’Rourke would be a good running mate.
@FrBower @Cobra1A @TonyAbbottMHR Having read a lot of the bible, I can see that his Christianity embodies a lot of his conservatism. 2 Kings 2: 23-24 seems apt.

@Josh_is_so_nice @GeoffRBennett @Yamiche Does it really matter when he took it back? Once he admitted it, it’s out there. Dressing up in either guise is something you know you would have done without straining your memory. It’s not normal livery in any sense.
@GeoffRBennett @Yamiche He sort of admitted he did partake in that photo. To try and take it back a few days later is farcical. He should cop his lumps and move aside. In politics, you don’t get second chances these days.
@ashlynbrierre @tobosbunny 2020 is completely different. The hate on Trump which was reflected in 2018 means Sanders spoilers won’t have the traction they had in 2016. His time has come and gone. The momentum to kick out Trump will also swamp the old fool.
@ashlynbrierre His popularity! Where are Bernie voters going to go? Trump? After this stunt, maybe they will see he offers nothing but nuisance value at best.
@tobosbunny @prisonculture If Sanders wants to step all over the Dems SOTU response, they should step all over his need for their infrastructure to run for President. It works both ways.

@AnnCoulter Trump couldn’t vote, nor could his kids. If he’s ineligible to vote, he’d be ineligible to run probably too. Do you think this stuff through or did it just came to you as you were dreaming of children locked up in cages?
@RealDealDaves27 @IlhanMN So someone earning $10 mill + a year and pays about $3.5mill tax thereabouts in that first $10 mill, will all of a sudden be in a life threatening situation even tho he has $6.5 million clear if they earn a $ past that $10 million!!! Really? Huh? Really??

@vermontgmg And a pretend president.
@DearAuntCrabby Nope, lock them up.
@JoyAnnReid @maddow Did he get a tin badge for this trip?
@OrBemet1 @MarkHertling @gatewaypundit @AOC Do you think if you put more solar panels in the system, it would dilute the sun? Moron.
@TheBeatWithAri @neal_katyal @AriMelber Don’t forget to mention Maya Wiley.
@JoQuinnbtchycat @operakatz @politico I’ve been to the US half a dozen times. The one overriding sense I have is that it’s a nation at war with itself. The levels of hate for others within the country is something I’ve never seen. I think since the downfall of the USSR you haven’t had an external foe to focus hate on
@JoQuinnbtchycat @operakatz @politico America is ok, just a diverse culture within a culture. But being from here, you never forget the levels of violence there are way in excess of what we get here. Guns etc. it’s a harsher society I guess in a nutshell.
@ndrew_lawrence He’s lukewarm at best. Like his coffee.
@JoQuinnbtchycat @operakatz @politico Yes, Melbourne Australia. Not perfect, no place is, but it’s pretty good here. Universal health, the climate is much more inviting, not over populated. NZ is more beautiful, roughly same lifestyles. We are both lucky countries.
@JoQuinnbtchycat @operakatz @politico Income redistribution. The extremes of wealth and poverty are the biggest I’ve seen. Absolute poverty as bad as the poorest nations and the immense wealth, all within a few miles of each other in some places. The wealthy need to be taxed more and welfare programs increased
@JoQuinnbtchycat @operakatz @politico For starters, Honolulu airport is a disgrace for a tourist destination. Then driving around LA can be like being in a warzone. Frisco.... the amount of homeless was astounding. Plenty of other example. Some good places too tho.
@TheSun A bit of commitment and everyone loses their heads!
@operakatz @JoQuinnbtchycat @politico You probably don’t realise how backward of a lot of things (not everything, but enough to be noticeable to a visitor) the US is. It feels like travelling back to the 70s in some places. Infrastructure being the most noticeable.
@SkyNewsAust @PeterGleeson63 I’m sure if this clown keeps saying it, even he will believe it one day.
@LindseyGrahamSC He has made physical threats. You reap what you sow.
@TheRynheart Number plates last that long?

@TomiLahren @KamalaHarris Harris would take one look at you and give a short, sharp, derisive laugh and move on as if you don’t exist. Which is pretty close to the mark given what you contributed.

@maggieNYT And come in at a lithe 180lbs probably.
@jonathanvswan It does speak to a double standard where Americans are quite willing to interfere in other nation’s politics but complain profusely when it happens to them.
@jemelehill @KamalaHarris She will get the candidacy and will beat Trump in a landslide.
@sahilkapur Don’t Presidential candidates answer hypotheticals because that’s the basis in which people can evaluate their candidacy?
@renato_mariotti He should be treated at least equally as bin Laden
@JenaFriedman Not just men. Some of my biggest threats for being anti Bern have been some very upset women. I don’t get the cult like hold he has on them.
@WajahatAli @ManchuCandidate Trump doesn’t think...... that is the real story.

@jdawsey1 @kmettler I reckon he’s seen it in a movie somewhere and it’s burned itself into his meagre consciousness so it’s become fact for him.

@WalshFreedom Many people believe you pick a side and stick to their consensus view on thy side of politics. It’s un-nuanced stupidity to expect that everyone has political views that follow that symmetry.
@9NewsAUS He declares a national emergency, it gets lost in the courts, Trump says he did all he could..... it’s the only way he can save face for his disastrous, idiotic wall policy.

@JordanUhl @AOC Took that clown months to come up with that genius!
@PaulineHansonOz The base load operators closed 3 generators this week in Victoria for maintenance. It’s their fault they didn’t maintain the infrastructure to be ready for this critical period. Of course a moron like you wouldn’t understand this.
@TIME Nothing worse than a python in the dunny.
@lawcrimenews @williamlegate If only he had a nagging doubt about his actions!
@HumanHeadline @AhronYoung @SkyNewsAust Because coal energy producers won’t invest in new generators because THIS federal government’s energy policy is a dog’s breakfast at best.
@BetteMidler @Cobra1A He has trouble dealing with black and white scenarios (especially the black). Adding a more complex alternative to his simplistic view of the world, is just totally going to screw with his cognitive ‘abilities’!

@JuliaDavisNews I’d say that the GOP would turn on him and 25A him, or give a wink to the Dems to proceed with impeachment with a favourable senate outcome assured.
@jhort89 @nauticavan @BenjySarlin The crushing loss where the Dems gained 8 million more congressional votes than the GOP. Bring on 2020 for that to translate into 22 GOP senators out of 33 seats are up for election ...... and then the less than 40% approval Trump’s loss. It’s a slaughter in the making.

@TonyHWindsor @EVERALDATLARGE They’ve given up governing. They’re now trying to save themselves after the inevitable rout coming their way.
@marcorubio @WalshFreedom Aren’t US newspapers meant to report on the actions of their ‘president’? What Trump does is more pertinent to their readership than if other countries do the same.

@SpecialK1xx @702Godfather @thehill He had 2 years of a GOP senate and House, and he did fuck all to push the agenda. He waited until he could manufacture a shitfight. He’s so transparent, it’s too funny. He said it was his shutdown and the polls are saying people believe that.
@SpecialK1xx @702Godfather @thehill The GOP were in charge when it shutdown, let them fix the problem. The Dems never said they would assist in his nonsense.
@SpecialK1xx @thehill If Trump threatens to shut down the border as he did once and threatens again, he obviously believes the infrastructure is capable of containing any threat. The wall is a bullshit excuse to rile up the deplorons. Why are you a deploron?
@SpecialK1xx @thehill Not to her satisfaction....... ill douchè will have to deal with it.
@Berger960 @jonathanvswan @WSJ News is news. If he didn’t want to be humiliated, he probably shouldn’t have acted as Trump’s thug for so long. No one ever said the punishment ends at imprisonment.

@scottwongDC @SteveKingIA @GOPLeader @juliegraceb It’s not as if he hadn’t said anything similar in the years prior to this ‘courageous’ stance. The GOP must see the writing on the wall in the lead up to 2020 and taking very late remedial action....... too late.
@SenatorCollins @StevenTDennis Then vote to veto Trump and get on with governing. This shutdown was started by the GOP when it had control of the House, Senate and White House. Now it’s up to the GOP to fix it.
@daltonator @NateSilver538 He’s a McDonalds ‘billionaire’ in every sense.

@WalshFreedom Trump threatens to close the border, which indicates he believes the current infrastructure is adequate as it is. Anyone with half a clue knows this is all about having a fight, nothing at all to do with actual border security.
@4YrsToday @aprilbaxter ‘Bozo’ isn’t in any legal trouble like ill douchè and in spite of being about to lose $70 billion, is still probably $70 billion better off than ill douchè .
@JEdgelord @washingtonpost The brain starts degenerating at age 30. So there really is no optimum age if we take into account these criteria. But if 35 is too young and degeneration begins at 30, then you can be comfortable in the fact that at 70, your best is behind you.
@JEdgelord @washingtonpost Why 35 before someone came run? Same argument. But what you’re electing at 70 and probably 74, can have a steep decline in mental health before they reach 78. Reagan’s last years are an example of the onset of diminished mental capability.

@rasm47 @CheriJacobus @lauferlaw @highbrow_nobrow Doesn’t meet the definition of ‘enemy’. War must be declared by congress for an enemy to exist. Article 3, section 3.... the language and definition is very narrow regarding treason.
@left_tack @WSJ Underrated post.
@RedTRaccoon Even an idiot realises eventually when they’re being slapped around the head.
@williamlegate He’s waiting for the pictorial edition.
@AOC Why the government doesn’t build a large complex to house politicians whilst in DC is beyond me . You don’t have to avail yourself of it, but if they expect you there, they should provide for it.
@Brasilmagic Idiots
@AshaRangappa_ @matthewjdowd Thor loser more like it.
@gthanku @emptywheel Why does she have to account for doing her job as required? She didn’t write the laws she had to prosecute, all she was required to do was apply the laws as required. Sometimes people have to do things in their job they don’t like. Who likes to clean toilets?
@GOPLeader @HouseGOP Pfft. You’ll give him a mild rebuke and he will tell you he has 1st A rights and you’ll back away because the whole GOP is craven and too scared to counter this type of narrative because you’ve encouraged those type supporters since Obama became President.
@JoshBBornstein @SarahRubyWrites George needs to read his bible. Leviticus 19:28 forbids any markings on the body.
@rhysam Dazza needs to hear it early. It’s not too late for Dazza to change.
@joel_horton5 @kurteichenwald Joel has to be a RUbot for sure.
@m_saadeldine @JuliaDavisNews The misled voter base don’t want to hear it. There is only one way to make them take notice..... lose jobs, lose money..... it’s all they think Trump brings them. So to have them lose them will open their eyes. Unpleasant outcome, but it is what it is.
@m_saadeldine @JuliaDavisNews I’m not a fan at all of Putin. The sooner he is dead, the better off we all are. But you can’t blame him doing what the US has done for decades. It’s to be expected in fact. The blame lies entirely with those from the US who bought into this treason. That’s what the US has to fix
@m_saadeldine @JuliaDavisNews Americans can’t ever forget the decades of interference they imposed on other nations political processes, including regime change and assassination. It’s not surprising it’s come back at the US. It’s up to the US to shore up their system. Nations will always try and interfere.
@SarahHuckabee There’s always a tweet with this mob.
@CheriJacobus @ManchuCandidate I think it’s a shot across Whittaker’s or Barr’s bow to inform congress that even if the report is suppressed, there are avenues for enquiry they can follow which can’t be stopped.
@ericgarland @karolcummins @FBI Mueller took over the investigation, so how does this clown know what has, or will come from it?
@PoliPessimist @samanthamaiden I know how reagent kits work. But if the kit is on the other side of a policed entrance, many will take the substance prior to arrival to avoid any police detection. Many won’t avail themselves of buying their own test kit too. Testing should be 1 part of a multi prong approach.
@willy_mcdilly @MSNBC There’s a plethora of evidence to support that claim too!
@samanthamaiden Especially as many would try and avoid detection by taking them prior to what they’re attending.
@MSNBC He really does act like he’s guilty of something...... ok..... a lot of things.
@gtconway3d @renato_mariotti @AshaRangappa_ Just for the lols!!!
@gtconway3d @renato_mariotti @AshaRangappa_ I think Putin is one of his advisers. That’s the problem!
@joshscampbell They’re not working or they are taking an injudicious amount of time to work. Justice delayed is justice denied.
@ddale8 He’s in hostage mode. He hasn’t left his self imposed misery for 2 years.
@rollo75 @deemadigan The market place is already open. It’s been open since the first person smoked a blunt. If there is a market for the product, there is a marketplace. Speaking of which, smoke a spliff and get over yourself.
@deemadigan Looks like he’s finally embraced the LBGT community with those shorts.
@rollo75 @deemadigan Because all the policing and drug busts with stiff sentences so far seems to solved that problem....... lol. Look, you can live in your theoretical world of what should be.... I choose to live in the real world of what happens.
@YNB @DrJasonJohnson Double whammy right there!!!
@itsJeffTiedrich Cmon..... him run anywhere? Let’s get real here.
@RadioFreeTom Don’t be judging Zep by Stairway to Heaven. I love the Zep, but refuse to listen to that. That’d be like judging Boston on songs like ‘more than a feeling’ and other similar dross.
@rollo75 @deemadigan And I do note people who have licences confiscated still drive and there are violent re-offenders. So policing is not a 100% solution to all on-going problems. So you try other remedies to compliment policing and hopefully save lives.
@rollo75 @deemadigan No. You think that was my argument. You want this to be a law and order solution when it’s a health issue which should be the first priority. Because they already are policing drugs and it’s not preventing deaths. So why wouldn’t you try another tack to see if that works?
@rollo75 @deemadigan Is that like saying don’t drink and drive or don’t be violent and the problem is then solved?
@GOP @SenTedCruz Look.... it’s vulvarine!!!
@maggieNYT Who can be bothered listening to him? I’d rather wait until the synopsis, to minimise exposure and maintain my sanity as much as I can.
@deemadigan Pill testing would be useful. But those who use before entering these sites to avoid detection still run a risk. There is no perfect solution this problem.
@DBHnBuckhead2 @davereaboi Lol. HRC, the most investigated person in US history over 25 years by the most aggressive of GOP prosecutors.  Not 1 charge laid. So either she is innocent or they’re fucking useless. You choose. Now go back to licking GOP 🥜’s
@TheRickWilson The ego. What about the carbuncle housing it?
@yashar @JudgeJeanine I read the notes..... in a child’s handwriting it said ‘no kolujen’
@ScottFrazier19 Up Pirroscooe
@JoshButler He’s a flog. How’s that for being Australian?
@JoshButler Thongs, stubbies and a singlet should do it nicely.
@theage I can see his problem, that Union Jack is cutting off the oxygen to his brain.
@JuliaDavisNews Nah. The US is dysfunctional now, but it will see out the 2 years left of this clown and the minute the new president takes office, it all changes for Putin. NATO will again be relevant and I’d say the new administration will be very very hawkish towards Russia.
@RadioFreeTom Lets hope that the interpreters, stenographers..... anyone involved in those conversations for the US, are subpoenaed by congress.
@StevenTDennis Isolate McConnell in the media and pound the message that he alone can bring this to an end. Do a media blitz every hour on message.
@MKGenest @smilon713 ill Douche
@RadioFreeTom @CharlesPPierce @MalcolmNance @MSNBC Patriots don’t try and undermine the constitution as Nixon did. Just because he eventually succumbed doesn’t mean his patriotism won out. He was just backed into a corner he couldn’t escape.
@NatashaBertrand He’d have to be having a long hard think now about that appointment.
@cryborg As much as we’d all like these things to happen, they are unrealistic. And the US has pretty much made itself immune to the reaches of the ICJ. He will be disgraced and yet in America that’s enough to ensure someone employs him elsewhere.
@MsKenman2008 @WatchDogBrunhil @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw https://t.co/zGoGS3jSQw
@politico $20 mill at Trump’s asking rate will build 1.5 miles of wall. Or 3 miles if he can halve the costs. This unrealistic request for money was always a con.
@narelleford @PhilipJohnBrow2 By the major parties doing it. He plants the seed of expectation knowing it can’t be done readily or easily and therefore gives him a pulpit to blame them. He’s a fraud.
@TheRickWilson With Yakety sax playing in the background
@GeoffreyBlair @bmaygers @MSignorile @jeffhauser War has to be declared by congress for this to become applicable. An adversarial nation is technically not an enemy. The statute pertaining to treason is very specific. Other charges obviously can apply.
@Arhylda @krassenstein Lawrence Tribe has already dismissed the talk of treason because of the requirement of war needing to be declared by congress. Other legal academics too have said it can’t apply in any of this Russia investigation. Other charges obviously can, but not the specific treason charge.
@krassenstein Doesn’t apply. War has to be declared by congress. It is very specific about that requirement.
@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump Name the specific charges.
@Finance8244 @MSNBC As an ex Catholic, they both are right to question the philosophy of this all male clique within the church that have positions counter to women’s rights.
@SenJoniErnst You obviously didn’t want to rush this statement because that would be ........... ??
@cryborg Miller won’t be charged with anything. He’s just a slimy advisor.
@JeffersonObama Vulvarine
@hoosierceb1 I blame the goo people
@JoeBarri Who are these goo people he speaks of?
@HoarseWisperer Hair? What’s that?
@ICC 3 for 4.  This is in Australia, so read it as such.
@SaysHummingbird @smilon713 Does that mean he’s better off if I kick him in the plums?
@TheRynheart He must have the steel supply contract lined up.
@MsKenman2008 @WatchDogBrunhil @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw Lol. Name the charges that the Trump lead AG office have levelled against Comey..... this should be good.
@MsKenman2008 @WatchDogBrunhil @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw So you’ve based your ideas on nothing but what you want the outcome to be. But the weight of prosecutions so far show that there are links to Russia from within the campaign staff and we get little snippets like this pointing to something far more sinister. But what you want!!!!!
@MsKenman2008 @WatchDogBrunhil @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw Because you have inside information? Because Mueller has told you privately..... because you’re ‘special’?
@MsKenman2008 @WatchDogBrunhil @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw Lol. You denialists are hilarious. What next? The world is flat? Vaccines are bad? 9/11 was an inside job?
@MsKenman2008 @WatchDogBrunhil @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw Except Comey kept any investigations quiet about Trump prior to the election. Can’t you at least get one theory right!
@MsKenman2008 @WatchDogBrunhil @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw Whose word do I take? You blah blah blah, or former FBI counter intelligence operative Frank Figliuzzi?
@MsKenman2008 @WatchDogBrunhil @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw And now congress has heard about it, they can pursue the FBI line of investigation if Whittaker curtails the report. Just a game of chess played beautifully. Loving this stuff.
@MsKenman2008 @WatchDogBrunhil @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw He might not leak evidence. But this isn’t evidence. This is just what’s happened.
@alvey5 @bet365_aus To be fair, he has batted for the opposition a fair bit in his time.
@MsKenman2008 @WatchDogBrunhil @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw Poor ill douchè, he can’t take a break. His flying lying tour of the border spoilt by Cohen’s statement he will testify to congress and now this leak.
@MsKenman2008 @WatchDogBrunhil @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw Obviously a strategic leak by Mueller to counter any block Whittaker will put on his report.
@MsKenman2008 @WatchDogBrunhil @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw FBI standards of proof required to initiate counter intel operations border on grand Jury standard evidence. The investigations were handed over to Mueller anyway. Cheeto is in trouble.
@ChildishBongino @lyrralt @davereaboi Actually no it doesn’t. It’s always meant open minded. But we know you’re the antithesis of  that. Now we have cleared up that you’re close minded. Fuck off
@MsKenman2008 @WatchDogBrunhil @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw The reports the FBI opened 2 investigations into based on his firing of Comey and the his 2 recorded conversations where he said he did it to be rid of the Russian investigations. One to the Russian foreign minister, one to Lester Holt. The bloke is a dickhead.
@ChildishBongino @lyrralt @davereaboi Look up the meaning of liberal. Fuck some people are stupid. Did you graduate from Trump University?
@ChildishBongino @lyrralt @davereaboi Liberalism gave you free speech. You moron!!
@ARTEM_KLYUSHIN @realDonaldTrump Fuck off boris.
@MsKenman2008 @WatchDogBrunhil @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw You keep saying that because I know you need to believe it. But all the evidence thus far points at all indictments in one hemisphere..... and it’s his hemisphere. The noose got a little bit tighter around his fat neck tonight. He will hate this... and that’s beautiful.
@RadioFreeTom @CheriJacobus @POLITICOMag Good read. The noose just got a little bit tighter around his neck tonight. This time just from the glare of people who are now looking at him who were happy to be in denial before. A death of a 1000 cuts.
@neeratanden The only thing I am shocked about is that he would serve another master over his own self.
@OpWolverines @lauferlaw I predict she will come near last in every primary she runs in.
@TomRed43 @deemadigan It’s a pity his name wasn’t Unning and we could have had Fraser Unning Conservative Klan.
@SarahHuckabee Bwahahahahaha..... someone’s in trouble!!!!
@lyrralt @davereaboi Hopefully, he won’t have any property by the end of all this.
@MsKenman2008 @WatchDogBrunhil @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw Lol. He’s in deep Russian shit. This is the best time ever. What shade do you think his stroke will be? Purple/orange?
@Rodney4KBluRay @CaslerNoel At least we know the scrutiny on any Russian contacts from any candidate will be intense now.
@CaslerNoel I think Putin is quite happy to let Trump hang. This was always a gamble for Putin and he probably didn’t think it’d pay off. So the subsequent chaos is just a bonus.
@DrCraigEmerson It’s been that way since Abbott’s 2013 campaign when he had 2 policies, get rid of the mining tax and carbon tax. After that, he had no agenda and subsequently had the lightest legislative agenda since the 1930s.
@davereaboi Nothing is a joke when it comes to Trump. He said it, they did it..... he’s in deep shit. And we all know it, no matter how much you try and deflect. And imagine what Mueller has that we don’t know about yet..... bets on what colour Trump has turned tonight? Orange/purple?
@CinnamonV @JustBrittany76 @JavierLandes @ScottPresler @SenKamalaHarris $500 for who gives a fuck...... your family.... that’d be the vacant lot wouldn’t it?
@CinnamonV @JustBrittany76 @JavierLandes @ScottPresler @SenKamalaHarris I’m taking bets on what colour he turns when he has that stroke. I’ve got purple with an orange hue. What’s yours?
@CinnamonV @JustBrittany76 @JavierLandes @ScottPresler @SenKamalaHarris He will barely make it they to the end of the 1st term. The GOP will run away from him as he becomes poisonous to their re-election chances. And the Dems will hound him in congress. It will be fantastic to watch him have apoplectic fits. Maybe even a stroke!!! Here’s hoping.
@CinnamonV @JustBrittany76 @JavierLandes @ScottPresler @SenKamalaHarris Economic growth was faster in Obama’s last 2 years than it was in Trump’s first 2. So too was employment uptake. It took over 200 years to run up $19 trillion debt. He’s increased it 10% in 2 years!!! When it falls in a heap, the drop will be immense. And it will.
@JoeNBC Trump’s sycophants know this alone will bring this nonsense to a halt in the courts. But as we all know, it’s the issue he wants. The wall is no use to him politically if it all of a sudden is approved.
@JustBrittany76 @CinnamonV @JavierLandes @ScottPresler @SenKamalaHarris Don’t make her lose her train of thought..... like the train at Petticoat Junction, it’s rare and often late if it runs at all.
@jonathanvswan @maggieNYT I’m sure Maduro gives a hoot.
@ECMcLaughlin @shearertoo Is it bad that I’m mildly amused but not in the least surprised?
@nytimes @Lawrence Yeah..... NAH!
@MsKenman2008 @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw I guess asking Russia to hack HRC’s emails in public was a starting point. But this was after Comey and his actions subsequent to the firing rang alarm bells and initiated a criminal and counter espionage enquiry. Trump is a Russian stooge without doubt. I reckon it’s about money
@JustBrittany76 @CinnamonV @JavierLandes @ScottPresler @SenKamalaHarris Cinnamon is more nutmeg than anything to be honest.
@CinnamonV @JustBrittany76 @JavierLandes @ScottPresler @SenKamalaHarris I typed it slowly for you. Any slower and it will be tomorrow.
@CinnamonV @JustBrittany76 @JavierLandes @ScottPresler @SenKamalaHarris I’m sure that’s your catch cry..... ‘no idea what you’re talking about.’
@JustBrittany76 @CinnamonV @JavierLandes @ScottPresler @SenKamalaHarris If you keep replying, I’ll keep answering. And the shutdown affects me in no way at all. It’s just posturing. He doesn’t want the wall because he had 2 years of GOP Congress to build it. He just wants the issue.
@CinnamonV @JustBrittany76 @JavierLandes @ScottPresler @SenKamalaHarris That stare is so vacant, you could build an apartment complex on it.
@CinnamonV @JustBrittany76 @JavierLandes @ScottPresler @SenKamalaHarris Your vacuousity....... it’s like looking at a kaleidoscope into nothing.
@CinnamonV @JustBrittany76 @JavierLandes @ScottPresler @SenKamalaHarris Xanax back in supply? Or has the peroxide stopped leaching into your head?
@MsKenman2008 @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw Life is not a Bill and Ted adventure. I’d cease that asap.
@MsKenman2008 @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw Well well well, it seems the FBI thought Trump was working for Russia too. After he fired Comey, they thought his actions were very suspicious and started an investigation into him. Lol. Comrade indeed.
@MsKenman2008 @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw Of course you do. That was never in doubt. And what are you?? 15? What adult uses the infantile term ‘dude’? Own up or grow up.
@JustBrittany76 @CinnamonV @JavierLandes @ScottPresler @SenKamalaHarris I might come from a harsher world than you. Let’s call it voluntary euthanasia.
@JustBrittany76 @CinnamonV @JavierLandes @ScottPresler @SenKamalaHarris I’m not so diplomatic. I’m all for a self cull of racists, idiots, pigs...... you name it. If they choose the Darwinian way, I’m all for it. I don’t have time to feel sorry for them.
@JustBrittany76 @CinnamonV @JavierLandes @ScottPresler @SenKamalaHarris How are they going to be if and when Harris gets the job?
@JustBrittany76 @CinnamonV @JavierLandes @ScottPresler @SenKamalaHarris It wasn’t a hard decision to make and I made it early. The tea party was a step too far. All because some uptight white people could not deal with a black man being their president. That’s it in a nutshell.
@JustBrittany76 @CinnamonV @JavierLandes @ScottPresler @SenKamalaHarris My guess is the lady from Stepford ran out of Xanax and got cranky and needed to own the thread and run it her way.
@gtconway3d The emergency is much like his wealth..... he wakes up and depending how he feels, he makes a determination on its strength.
@DisabledResist @smilon713 A picture of Trump playing Tennis. If that doesn’t force you to turn back, nothing will.
@PamKeithFL I yearn for some reasoned, calm thinking that she brings in abundance. She is beyond impressive, she is eminently qualified.
@katerinareports @Teddy_Stache Handbags for everyone!!!
@MsKenman2008 @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw Actually, before destroying and division, he’s actually all for himself first. And he doesn’t give a rats toss bag about you, me, even his family if it came down to a choice of him and what affects him. He will sell anyone out to save himself or further his own cause.
@MsKenman2008 @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw Poor Kenny, doesn’t like to hear where her side of politics has descended to. I saw the writing on the wall in the primaries. This clown is all about destroying and division, not building. He will let you down eventually too. But you have to discover that for yourself.
@keithboykin Sometimes, you just can’t help stupid. You can try, but in the end, the impulse is too strong in a lot of cases.
@marcorubio Voting to restart government would go a long way to thwarting the orange buffoon. You just have to want to cut him off at his knees.
@jonathanvswan @NunbergSam He loves the attention.
@MsKenman2008 @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw Anyone on the Trump shit train is now a Russian ally. You’re all comrades of Putin now. Trump has made the GOP an instrument of the Russian agenda.
@DanCrenshawTX The GOP has all that for 2 years and did nothing to drive this agenda. We all know Trump doesn’t want the wall, he just wants the issue. He’s playing you for chumps.
@funder @MichaelCohen212 It was almost like it was orchestrated. Imagine the flight home on AF1!
@JaneyGodley Fuck those hands are small!!
@MollyMcKew Nyet
@alvey5 Selectors have basically failed to be innovative in this year that required at least experimentation. They have a formula and can’t be swayed from it. But it’s not working.
@jonfavs It’s all up to McConnell. McCarthy is obsolete.
@AlanDivver @TjackRH Lol. Without Foles executing, you got nothing.
@AlanDivver @TjackRH I’m not forgetting how Foles has won this team a super bowl and how he took a team on the brink of missing out altogether this year and into week 2 at least with 4 consecutive wins. Right now, he’s better than Wentz.
@GOPChairwoman At least neither are ashamed of their family name and change it under orders from Shitler.
@gtconway3d That’s better.....
@Independent I call him that without any prompting.
@TheRickWilson I wish hadn’t done that..... she won’t shut up now.
@TjackRH Did you have the Eagles winning on their home deck? Foles got them over the line when they probably shouldn’t have won. And Wentz has done 2/5s of fuck all..... except get injured.
@TjackRH That last touchdown drive was all him. Down 10-15..... he had to be methodical and calm.
@TjackRH @gtconway3d Foles dragged the Eagles into the playoffs and past Chicago. Combined with last year’s Super Bowl, if he isn’t first pick, they’ve lost their minds.
@ezralevin When McConnell turns, it will be very quickly done. He is hanging on until the very latest he can, hoping he doesn’t have to cop the wrath of that moron. But inevitably he will turn or turn a blind eye to other GOP senators. And he will cop a serve from the idiot.
@coffeeshopjihad Well..... I guess they’re not hiding it anymore.
@realDonaldTrump So what you’re saying is that after 2 years, you haven’t! I notice Turkey didn’t show America much respect by shunning Pompeo. Didn’t they get your memo?
@parscale @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats Cool story...... but Christmas is over and we are back to reality now. None of this make up bullshit until Easter.
@MsKenman2008 @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw I’m pro truth. I don’t give a fuck who you are if you tell bullshit. I’ll call you on it whatever gender you choose to be. And now back to your comrade Manafort ........
@Mimirocah1 @RudyGiuliani Rudy is just learning the law as he posts. He thanks you for the free lessons.
@CinnamonV @JavierLandes @ScottPresler @SenKamalaHarris Are you saying I can’t? And generalised comments aren’t allowed?
@CinnamonV @JavierLandes @ScottPresler @SenKamalaHarris I said ‘some’. Where did I make a definitive statement ? Get your ability to comprehend right before you comment.
@MsKenman2008 @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw The very very amusing thing here is: this is only known because of a mistake by Manafort’s legal team. All the things Mueller has kept under wraps is where the meat lies. And it will be immense. And probably the funniest day of our lives.
@MsKenman2008 @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw I don’t watch CNN. Lol. Not on my viewing schedule at all. Cmon Ken, get with the program.
@MsKenman2008 @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw I’m not a liberal. I’m a conservative. But this GOP is not conservative. It’s a radicalised chaotic disaster that will implode. And Trump will destroy many people’s lives in the process of trying to save himself.
@MsKenman2008 @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw You may have heard it..... but it isn’t. I’m sure Fox News will report anything that tries and keeps distance between Manafort and Trump. But he was campaign manager and his lawyers admitted in a sentencing submission how he lied about providing info to Russian oligarch.
@CinnamonV @JavierLandes @ScottPresler @SenKamalaHarris Some people who kill with a gun aren’t criminals right up until they pull that trigger.
@MsKenman2008 @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw Papadopolous was charged about his lying with regards to his contacts with Russian officials. I’d say the real meaty stuff will drop all at once at the end. It will be the funniest day to be watching TV that day. Ol Shitler will have an orange tinged stroke.
@MsKenman2008 @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw WEL that’s incorrect as of the other day as Manafort’s own lawyer neglected to redact information about his sharing information with a Russian oligarch with official ties to Putin. So we have the campaign manager sharing information with Russians regarding the campaign.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Is sycophancy difficult when your master is in Texas?
@realDonaldTrump Where did you lose them?
Get a load of this bullshit!!! Trump University graduate with honours https://t.co/gdCa7QFzqq
@BrianKeeling9 @BarbaraRedgate OMG!!! I know you need to believe this fucking bullshit, but seriously.... seek medical help. Another Trump University graduate!!
@MsKenman2008 @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw The lie that Comey and HRC should be charged. Name the specific statutes under which they will be charged. Even Gowdry’s congressional hearings couldn’t come up with a single charge. And he tried. I do note all the charges from Mueller all are from Trunp’s orbit however.
@theheraldsun Never heard of a conference call?
@wvjoe911 @leeleeb50 @NBCNews These evangelicals should be the first and only exception, unless others want to buy into their stance.
@jedsusa @JDiamond1 The senate Republicans will turn on him eventually. He might last the full first term. But that’s the end of his political career and the start of his legal battles.
@DailyCaller Bullshit. You ran with it for as long as you could.
@ericgarland I’m glad a wall stopped that shipment!
@CBSNews I take it motorcycles are a rare sighting here!
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump How do walls prevent visa overstay, which is the overwhelming abuse of immigration laws? Huh?
@MsKenman2008 @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw Pfft. You keep responding, I will keep countering your bullshit. You don’t get a free pass when you’re telling blatant lies and mistruths.
@MsKenman2008 @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw Listen Ken, I never mentioned your husband. Now did I? Unless of course you apply the same evidence of that to HRC.
@BrianKeeling9 @BarbaraRedgate Like Putin? Trump’s mate!
@UTtanyaTU @MsKenman2008 @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw She’s a he. It’s Ken Man!
@MsKenman2008 @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw Any law student can tell you, there are 2 parts to a crime, the act and the intent to commit a crime. She didn’t intend to commit a crime.... a hard concept you you to grasp I know. But comey understood the futility in charging her... geesh. Definitely more miss than hit!
@MsKenman2008 @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw So you’re naturally fucking stupid!
@MsKenman2008 @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw You are more miss than ms
@UTtanyaTU @MsKenman2008 @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw I don’t think she wants to answer that. They may have run out of Xanax in Stepford today.
@UTtanyaTU @MsKenman2008 @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw HRC is possibly the most investigated person in US history, over 25 years, by the most aggressive Republican prosecutors..... and not 1 charge laid against her. So it’s either she’s guilty of nothing or they’re incompetent.
@UTtanyaTU @MsKenman2008 @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw They hurt his feelings
@thomaskaine5 Its the combover and the orange complexion and the 300 lb+ Herculean mass and the vocabulary and and and
@ylanmui ‘Maybe definitely’ being the new redundant to probably!!
@Acosta The wall is overkill, but the waist high chain link fence is definitely inadequate.
@MsKenman2008 @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw Lol. You certainly have more delusion than I do.
@JRubinBlogger @Saintsfan5348 Hopefully he never gets tired of it. It’s good for a laugh.
@MsKenman2008 @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw Yeah because all those indicted come from which side of politics? You dickheads are hilarious with your denial. Is there a school you go to, to be this fucking stupid? Trump University perhaps?
@MsKenman2008 @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw You keep up that brave stance. It’s all you got with the report about to drop in the next few months. Do you think Shitler can keep up this manufactured crisis that long?
@DavidJollyFL Makes sense.
@Teddy_Stache @hughhewitt He’s making a living out of being a sole voice of dissent on MSNBC. It$ all about the dollar for him.
@divechickinabox @BillKristol Mitch better get used to being Trump’s fall guy. Because every time Trump fails with his un-nuanced bluffs, he’s going to need a scale goat to blame. And he now knows Nancy and Chuck are going to just put the ball back in his court.
@DailyMail @MailOnline How will he survive?
@MickMCG34 A very competitive warm up lap.
@BillKristol He’s not going to keep it shutdown for another month. The GOP senate will relent and both houses will override his potential veto.
@Mimirocah1 They’re re-writing the espionage laws now because of!
@DavidCornDC @JoeNBC @RhondaPhears It got taken over by religious zealots because they couldn’t handle a black man being president and it’s devolved into an even bigger sewer since then.
@thehill Doesn’t she have some terminally ill war heroes to wish death on?
@225VOLT @thehill You, hence your response.
@MsKenman2008 @UTtanyaTU @toxicorange66 @RWPUSA @tribelaw Was that about the time Giuliani realised Trump had colluded with the Russians and ran the ‘collusion isn’t a crime’ narrative? No matter the vernacular used, the offence will be very precisely worded if it applies and is charged.
@GOPLeader @WhiteHouse Did they storm out? Or was that Shitler?
@BarbaraRedgate Stuff him. Hopefully it’s as painful as you say.
@AOC @DailyCaller You’re living rent free in their heads.
@realDonaldTrump This is your shutdown. You owned it weeks ago. It’s ALL on YOU. And you’re too inadequate to deal with it.
@BillKristol Looks like an ad for dentures.
@joesphVoid @NBCNews I’m saying christians when they want to be cunts, can be as big a cunts as those they condemn. This being Kentucky .... you know Kim Davis territory...... it’s got that special sort of Christianity written all over it.
@JAngello85 @Evan_Rosenfeld @MelissaJPeltier @npfandos @tackettdc It may be pre crafted. But it still comes down to who blinks first and it most probably will be the GOP senate. And then Trump loses and will rail against everyone. But it then makes him look obsolete as congress finds a way to govern without him.
@DrDenaGrayson @SenatorLankford They better re-write the espionage laws then, because this changes everything!
@Acosta If you’re upsetting this mob in the White House, you’re doing something right.
@RadioFreeTom I like hearing her. She was elected by her constituents because she is the way she is. A democracy isn’t meant to be a chorus of the same message.
@joesphVoid @NBCNews We both know it won’t be Islamic. We both know she will be some sort of Christian nut case.
@HumanHeadline @AmyRemeikis The longer he goes on, the more damage he’s doing to his party and electoral chances. He’s plainly useless.
@AliVelshi She rounded up
@BevanShields They photoshopped the foot out of his mouth.
@latimes He got a buzzer out of it.
@thehill If trump thinks closing the border is effective as he has stated, then he obviously has the hardware in place already. It’s just a matter of complimenting it with technology and border personnel.
@1600Propaganda @seanhannity It was as boring as batshit and induced narcolepsy. Next time, try doing it with a line of Charlie. Mind you.... All that snorting and sniffing was the only thing keeping me awake.
@girlsreallyrule We need more ‘smartass’ reporters to hold these liars to account. More power to Acosta.
@NBCNews What religion will she undoubtedly profess to be?
@IronMan26048452 @TheRickWilson Given most ‘illegal’ status violations are from visa overstayers, what’s a wall going to do to stop that?
@maggieNYT It was narcolepsy inducing TV. I’ve seen more personality from a tree stump. And he said nothing new.
@AndrewGillum @realDonaldTrump It was like receiving a lobotomy from a TV screen. It was flatter than the salt pans. I’ve seen more personality coming from a tree stump.
@MSNBC @maddow She was good tonight. And she will only get better.
@danpfeiffer I found myself wondering if they had found a cure for narcolepsy.
@RadioFreeTom I bet he had to change his incontinence pad after that.
@thehill It’s a crisis of an arsehole
@TheRickWilson He looks like the prune juice just kicked in and he’s doing his best to stop the flow.
@deemadigan @ScottMorrisonMP Someone? Or many ones?
@CalebJHull Pfft....... When she turns on Trump, and she will, Acosta will be there to report on it.
@ChrisMurphyCT @djrothkopf @brianschatz You can’t drink that much in 8 minutes.
@oliverdarcy Fox don’t have their in depth story in Pandas ready to run yet?
@StevenLHall1 To get good odds with their bookie?
@TheBeatWithAri If Mueller wants to find them, he will find them.
@JordanUhl @swin24 @Acosta I wonder if George likes her.
@kylegriffin1 Manchin is now officially the 54th GOP senator.
@GeorgeR77873882 @aaron_schwa @Angie_Koeln @NBCNews That’s my guess or a Russian bank.
@HillReporter He won’t look weak, he will look stupid and weak.
@MaxKoslowski @Cobra1A @michaelkoziol Aren’t his constituents in Qld? What’s he doing visiting other states?
@abc730 @StephenLongAus 40 years ago, it was proposed to be turned into oil.
@Eugene_Scott @NaveedAJamali He’s not hurting the people he should be hurting!!! Really!
@NBCNews No
@enoris @Martina @MaxBoot But he knows words! He has the best words!!!
@penbo @AndrewReimer01 @KateEllisMP Lol. Ouch!
@Efstathios1971 @abcnews Anyway, you’re boring me endlessly now.
@Efstathios1971 @abcnews (Labels, not lables, just sayin’) And you really need to stop your homoerotic fantasies about bums. Just because you worship Layinpipe, it doesn’t mean you have to reflect that in all your posts.
@Efstathios1971 @abcnews Bad lisp too. This is not a good day for you is it Effluent, or however you pronounce your name! Outed, incel’d, poor writing skills and now a speech impediment!!! Take a bex and go to bed.
@Efstathios1971 @abcnews I’m going to get that interpreted into English and I might get back to you. A word of advice though: syntax is important. It separates us from the animals. And still does, so it seems.
@Efstathios1971 @abcnews Once again..... more with the obsession with men and their arses. I know you’re Greek and all...... but seriously, leave your hobbies at home.
@Efstathios1971 @abcnews Not only are you an incel, but it seems your sexuality is fluid. So whilst you’ve doubled your odds, all it ends up being is that you’re being rejected from all sides. Way to go!!!
@Efstathios1971 @abcnews I know that’s what you dream about. You’re only human ;-)
@Efstathios1971 @abcnews Bwahahaha . I support you in your alternative lifestyle choices elef.... whatever the fuck your name is!!
@SecNielsen Went up from 3 to 6!!! Man the decks!!! The hordes are swarming!!!!
@Efstathios1971 @abcnews I do note, you have a caricature of Fredy Mercury and yet you insist on questioning others about their anal fixation!!! Lol.... oh the irony!!
@Martina @MaxBoot At least with Trump, you know not to believe anything he says. With the communists, some things they said had to be true, not everything, but some things.
@Efstathios1971 @abcnews We’ve all got you figured out. And stop obsessing over other people’s arses.
@thehill He can’t stop a Democrat run House  judiciary committee holding a public hearing questioning Mueller.
@Efstathios1971 @abcnews Seems to me that you haven’t had much success with the ladies. Couldn’t you fit ‘incel’ into your name?
@Mediaite Resigning would just about do it.
@AdamParkhomenko They should agree to do it on delay and have his words accompanied by graphics for every lie a huge red X covers the screen.
@NateSilver538 Lost the house? Lost? The house? Lost the house?
@ZydarNinja @alvey5 Needs to move to NSW.
@Independent His ego?
@Efstathios1971 @abcnews You keep telling yourself that. But the coward is running away because he’s going to cop a flogging if he stays in federal parliament. Gutless turd.
@abcnews Must be some women in the NSW parliament he hasn’t harassed yet.
@EVERALDATLARGE He got 19 votes but didn’t get elected. He was appointed after that moron Malcolm Roberts was ruled ineligible.
@australian @rosieslewis New women to harass?
@chrislhayes America went back 50 years in one very ‘foul’ swoop with this malignant administration
@realDonaldTrump What were you saying about how long it took Obama to get Bin Laden? Took even longer to get this clown...... why didn’t YOU get him sooner? Apparently it’s very easy according to you.
@RicFinlay @damiantardio Jim blames the AFL for all the Sydney rain.
@jemelehill Just get him off the street. That’s all that matters at this stage.
@AprilDRyan Calling it as he sees it.
@randlight @Cobra1A At least he didn’t ask for it to be prayed away.
@KellyO @JoSantisteban He doesn’t pay his bills.
@JoyAnnReid These people are empty vessels.
@60Minutes @MalcolmNance Trump only condemns belatedly, half heartedly and always with a proviso that he doesn’t really believe what he’s saying when it comes to these things. And that’s when he does condemn at all.
@kylegriffin1 The idiot would have heard Trump talking about tariffs prior to the election. What did he think the impacts would be?
@CheriJacobus @highbrow_nobrow Civilisations die when people like Carlson hold up progress.
@kasie Biden and Sanders as men should be concerned about their age. It’s time for a new generation of politics and politician.
@JamilSmith If he did it, then he needs to be taken off the street so no other kid is endangered by him. Some things don’t need to be deconstructed to end up being something else.
@neeratanden Mr Barber should publish his address.
@9NewsMelb Video went 19 seconds longer than Mundine lasted.
@NormOrnstein @MollyJongFast I hate it when they make such a strong bid so early in the year. They tend to get lost in the traffic of other stupidity as the year progresses and we tend to forget about them.
@KayaJones Less nervous than sending my kid to a Christian school.
@TheRickWilson Honey Boo Boo
@octopodashuffle @angelihide @TitusNation @Erin_412 Nah. They’ll laugh flat knocker at ya.
@angelihide @TitusNation @Erin_412 It means to laugh quietly, derisively
@angelihide @TitusNation @Erin_412 Australian term actually
@realBoHendy @williamlegate @REALDEALCHAOS @TomMarino7 @GenaRay18 @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama So tough he can’t even write the word ‘shit’!!! Weak as piss.
@TonyHWindsor @Cobra1A Moronison probaby figures there’s not that many sitting days in which he ‘begrudgingly’ has to accept Annings vote.
@mormorlady @Cobra1A Was he attending the Filipino branch of the nazis?
@MikeCarlton01 @Cobra1A Attached..... we need an edit function!!!
@MikeCarlton01 @Cobra1A I always thought the concept of a master race had some semblance of ‘mastery’ attaches to it. Looking at the pictures from yesterday, they certainly had mastered atrophy and genetic decline by the looks of them.
@steve___y @Ifearforfuture @DontVoteLibs @deemadigan That would require showing initiative on his behalf. Something we know he lacks. And I’m not sure Credlin would have given him permission.
@PushinWeight @BrandMeEbony @BritniDWrites @dreamhampton @johnlegend Too old for new people in my life.
@KaryPary @Elise_Jordan He probably would believe it once he said it too.
@StopTheSpeaker @aprilbaxter Weak as piss.
@GroverNorquist Unrealistic
@hanoiXan @daveweigel @CNN Which part was rude?
@samanthamaiden It’s bad when you make Pauline Hanson seem reasonable in comparison!
@PushinWeight @BrandMeEbony @BritniDWrites @dreamhampton @johnlegend Don’t know him
@ChrisVanHollen I reckon in private McConnell is screaming to get govt open again. Either McConnell or Trump will fold in a week.
@PushinWeight @BrandMeEbony @BritniDWrites @dreamhampton @johnlegend Name them. These filth don’t deserve the sanctuary of anonymity.
@ProPaintersGrou And he should be hounded with no mercy and no peace in his life
@ProPaintersGrou How many pedophiles do you know? I don’t any and if I did find out someone was, the cops would be knocking of their door quick smart.
@hughhewitt @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton Trump owned it. End of story. Trump said Mexico would pay.... end of story. Your attempts to rewrite what was said are pathetic and futile.
@ananavarro Call ‘em how you see ‘em. If that’s the worst he gets called, he’s doing well, because there is a plethora of worse names that would be apt.
@realDonaldTrump Someone sounds worried.
@Acosta They couldn’t do it in an office in the White House? You know...... government shutdown and all!
@sirDukeDevin @smilon713 He’s all sorts of fuckers. The fact is, for a time after his last child was born..... he wasn’t motherfucking.
@maydaymindy9 @smilon713 Religion.
@JeffFlake Nope.... you’re wrong...... and also insipid. Just fade away and let those who want to really fight this malignancy get on with the real fight.
@thehill Tlaib doesn’t need him apologising for her. She’s quite capable speaking for herself. And she certainly spoke for herself and many many others.
@SallyQYates You really should consider running for President in 2020.
@Emolclause @AOC It will just drive money and the wealthy off shore. Just as trickle down economics doesn’t work, excessively taxing also has consequences that are deleterious
@sarahkendzior Have the hearings, but use the findings for 2020. That’s the tact they should be using.
@kylegriffin1 And Carter is busy building houses for the poor, not walls. He wouldn’t give this clown the time of day.
@MSNBC I don’t know what the fuss is all about. There are a number of 4 letter options she could have used that were equally appropriate. I would have used the whole lot of them.
@WalshFreedom Let it start at the top. Until then...... rip into the prick.
@csregan @eldridge_monty @TheRickWilson @TuckerCarlson @Twitter @jack Monty versus all the voices in his head. A death match to the last voice.
@Elise_Jordan Andrew Jackson came to him in his sleep!
@1116sen @alvey5 He’s bought himself another 2 series just through consistency.
@_SJPeace_ @smilon713 Making a grown man cry!!!
@SocialPowerOne1 She’s worried that will affect the bullshit she speaks.
@Turnip2020 @smilon713 It was a turnip for the books for some I guess.
@AngryBlackLady Personally, I think the C bomb is a more apt description. Especially as he was fucking around on the mother of his child. He was more a ‘non mother fucker’ in that instance and probably many more instances we don’t know about, but suspect.
@LittlejonAllen @dbongino @TheRickWilson It’s a big empty space though. Room to move freely.
@PamKeithFL @krassenstein @MtnManMT6 Them and anyone who is restricted by government regulation......
@funder 2020 is looming fast in her calculations.
@ClydeHaberman This is the comedy channel we are listening to ?
@LaurenUnderwood Can you hop over to the Rose Garden and sedate the idiot who is rambling on?
@hughhewitt @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Nup. No one but morons are buying that. I noticed you’ve bought it tho!
@UncleBlake25 Lol https://t.co/JDWPGMakrD
@thedailybeast If someone in that town can’t organise a drive by or a drive over...... then they deserve to be terrorised by a turkey.
@JDiamond1 Trump could be gone sooner than we think.
@CheriJacobus @highbrow_nobrow He needs to be seen to be held to justice or the whole judicial system isn’t working.
@DrDenaGrayson Guaranteed by years end, the foul language coming that side of the aisle will be far worse.
@UncleBlake25 That’s if Trump’s EPA hasn’t destroyed that too
@UncleBlake25 You need the fresh air
@UncleBlake25 Start rolling then.
@UncleBlake25 Get a mirror then. Fuck your happy thoughts. And maybe get out and do a bit of walking.......
@politvidchannel @smilon713 By the time the next 2 years is up, there will be a lot of GOP congressionals muttering 4 letter words on a daily basis. They are about to be introduced to hell.
@thehill Didn’t the turtle say he would block everything Obama would try to do?
@washingtonpost It wasn’t the queen, it was the Governor General who over reached. And the ability to block supply is always there if the opposition can manage the numbers. But an election would be called before it got to that. The political mechanism works.
@UncleBlake25 The only shit I see overflowing is from your mouth.
@UncleBlake25 @David34271557 @NBCNews Sue me.
@David34271557 @UncleBlake25 @NBCNews DHS award the contracts for this activity and they are..... you know, on a shutdown. For fucks sakes, you morons can’t put one and one together.
@David34271557 @UncleBlake25 @NBCNews My name isn’t Hastert. He hasn’t contracted out out 115 miles. He said he did, but he doesn’t actually award contracts you fool. Stop believing everything the fucking orange moron says. Use your brain....... if you have one.
@UncleBlake25 @NBCNews Trump had 2 years with a GOP senate and House. He did nothing to further his wall. He didn’t even spend 10% of the money he got last budget for the ‘wall’. The Dems never said they would assist his wall. He fucked it up. It’s all on him.
@thejimjams Yoda v Fido
@StanW22 @Morning_Joe @WSJopinion I think he sees Trump is a cancer attached to a host he can’t quite divorce. If you kill the cancer, you might kill the host too. His dislike for Trump isn’t as strong as his unbridled love for the right. He’d rather Trump didn’t exist, but ....... you know.....
@StanW22 @Morning_Joe @WSJopinion Let’s face it..... what can he say that still keeps him in favour with his side of politics and still not look 100% sycophantic towards the moron? He looks uncomfortably wishy washy because he knows we know he’s fence sitting.
@RealKyleMorris @tripgabriel Good on her. Just showing a bit of conviction to what she believes in. Unlike shitler and his wall/slats/Venetian blind/Mexico is paying for it/America is paying for it/I know words, I have the best words!!!
@StanW22 @Morning_Joe @WSJopinion He’s doing his utmost not to be 100% critical of the orange moron. But all that does is show his subjective view of politics. He just can’t completely divorce himself from the wrong side of politics and history.
@No1MachopFanVGC @tigerfox36 @GenevieveAlison @theheraldsun At least they won’t be cooked to death in a car. Baseline, you take them away from these types who have either no care or no concept of basic welfare for a child.
@Jim_Jordan Don’t you have some sexual predator enabling to do?
@4YrsToday @maladamus From birth...
@latikambourke That makes you go chase affairs?
@dailytelegraph I wonder if Langer knows there are pace bowlers in other states other than NSW.
@AOC Wear it as a badge of honour. Anyone who piss those clowns off, must be doing something right.
@DailyMailUK @MailOnline A couple of nose beers.
@Shobji @LevineJonathan @RashidaTlaib Says you.
@politico It doesn’t hurt to have Pelosi’s  priorities challenged from within the Dems. All issues need someone championing them, otherwise they get left behind.
@kylegriffin1 What is this???? An adult in the room!!!!
@ChadPergram @cryborg ...... and slowly but surely some sanity is being restored to American politics.
@realDonaldTrump Taxes on Americans, that’s all you’ve done.
@yashar That worked out well for him. Just boosted AOC’s popularity immeasurably.
@kelly2277 If you don’t advertise.....
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Be prepared for shocked and bore!
@TheRickWilson @Teddy_Stache So it’s pre set as ‘looser’ by default.
@Politidope @MaryRWilliams4 @SpeakerPelosi Lol. Trump is no match for someone with intelligence and conviction.
@Mediaite Tunnels work too. Ask any US soldier who was in Vietnam.
@mkraju He thinks it’s part of Kenya.
@TheRickWilson I’m sure you see it as a badge of honour.
@CheriJacobus He needs to shoot his tailor for starters.
@KremlinTrolls The end of his presidency started when he ‘won’ and opened his mouth. It was all on a steady decline after that point.
@Breaking911 @WalshFreedom Who cares about the bagel!
@gtconway3d Don’t make it too complicated for him.
@woodruffbets It’s a set up
@AnonymousQ1776 She’s winning so far..... you’re not.
@JeannieG40 Disappointing for all concerned!
@AngelaBelcamino Directions to Janesville
@Qldaah @Cobra1A He’s still PM!  That’s some innings, even considering it was a coup.
@soledadobrien It was good for Warren, she doesn’t have to compete to get her political agenda out with a dozen others. And she sort of stole some of Sander’s political territory.
@DavidCornDC What he said in 2012 is forgotten and probably pales in comparison to today’s abomination. But it’s a timely reminder that Romney too has a social engineering desire to suppress the poor and sick.
@PeterTobias8 @adamcbest He got 56% of the vote in Kentucky. That’s a sizeable win in the only market that matters to him. Trying to implant him into the entire US electorate is pointless because he’s not competing in that marketplace.
@adamcbest He’s probably quite popular in Kentucky. Which says a lot about Kentucky.
@GlennKesslerWP Someone had to put this complete nonsense in his head. He’s not smart enough to come up with that.
@thedailybeast @TheRickWilson Words are cheap. Let’s see what actions he takes.
@RudyGiuliani Either go visit your cousin or find a 4th wife, but get off Twitter either way.
@gatewaypundit Who is the fuckwit who thinks she’s going to impose communism? What a blonk.
@CNNPolitics @Acosta That horse has long bolted.
@ZerlinaMaxwell The problem with not taking it into account as part of the forthcoming elections is that Trump will make electability and the such an issue. That’s his one real talent.... he can character assassinate someone with one nickname.
@JRubinBlogger Essentially, she just needs to say and do nothing if that’s what she’s trying to achieve.
@OckerbyTran He was arrested and is currently unable to meet his $1000 bond.
@PhilipRucker His ‘presidency’ made a deep descent on the 20 Jan 2017...... it never rose above that.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump This is too funny. Uncle Mitt has upset your Grand Leader....... and now you have to perform mental gymnastics to appease one and not mention the other. This is the best entertainment going.
@PamKeithFL @CNN @politico @MSNBC @washingtonpost @nytimes @thehill Trump has one ability and that is to diminish opponents in the eyes of many with a nickname. He did it to a host of republicans and he’s done it to her. It’s unfortunate, but it’s the politics of now.
@MikeCarlton01 @Cobra1A I don’t care if this POS loses his citizenship. What I want the minister to do, is know what he’s doing, when he does it, rather than making it up on the run.
@realDonaldTrump ..... can and can’t pass.... damn no twitter edit function!
@lenoretaylor @Cobra1A They have Kool Aid at Lib party meetings?
@realDonaldTrump Pelosi will spend 5 minutes on this before sending it off to the Senate. She has bigger fish to fry and it’s not up to her what the Senate cannot can’t pass.
@jerryjamesstone @cmclymer @MittRomney I particularly like how he sees the problem only from December 2018. As is the previous 22 months weren’t problematic at all!
@ggqt3 He grabbed her. Kick the shit out of him.
@NicolleDWallace I watch it, or listen to it from Australia pretty much all the time now.
@sean_7_ It’s damn you moron. As in damnation, not a large body of water, which however, may describe your cerebral situation.
@ProudDemResists @smilon713 Trump
@samstein Ruffly
@BillKristol ‘Big, dumb mouth.....’ He knows words, he has the best words.  !!
@SamanthaZMitra @Cobra1A Don’t mess with Penny Wong. She’s probably the smartest operator in parliament. She should consider moving to the lower house.
@SpockResists Trump’s smear campaign has worked and she won’t be electable. Unfortunate, but the reality of politics.
@Drworkaholic @BridgetPhetasy Imagine wanting to be right in a discussion!!!
@JuliaDavisNews Putin won so it seems.
@realDonaldTrump You couldn’t even find Harvard on a map.
@thehill Who said they had to?
@maggieNYT Otherwise known as throwing people under a bus.
@brithume Isn’t he the best deal maker ...... ever?
@bariweiss You only need like 1cm on the the top of your knife first time user. Don’t spread it like it’s peanut butter. Once you get the amount right, you’ll never look back with options to use with..... cheese, avocado, bacon..... best stuff ever.
@RealMarkLatham And the solution to drink driving is not drinking. And the solution to domestic violence is no violence......
@thehill The Dems never said in the mid terms that they would bargain on this.
@SouthwickMP @FrBower @FatherBob @chriskkenny @AlexanderDowner Which part of ‘started’ don’t you understand?
@siano2020 @ManchuCandidate 30 words..... maybe
@EVERALDATLARGE I’ve heard of a mutton Dagger, but now we have some clown who thinks he’s a Dutton MAGA
@David74647787 @CheriJacobus @TomNisen @realDonaldTrump Only if they’re visiting Trump.
@davidfrum More a lump of rock than anything.
@curlymaz @CheriJacobus @realDonaldTrump Just because you want it to be true, doesn’t make it so. Sit back and watch the slow death of the Trump administration. It’s actually very good viewing.
@TitusNation It’s cold in St Petersburg today. He needs to warm up first before anything more substantive.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews So much for being the best deal maker.
@9NewsAUS It’s too late Pete, Moronison got the job. Campaigning for it now is pointless. Wait until after May, then you and Abbott can slug it out for the leader of the opposition job.
@RudyGiuliani I think I just heard Mueller snort with derision.
@Brasilmagic You can’t run without a spine.
@MollyJongFast Roger has obviously had some bad news recently.
@CheriJacobus @highbrow_nobrow Amoral maybe.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews The Democrats never said they were going to vote for your wall unless there were concessions. So...... give them concessions..... DACA for starters. You say you’re the best negotiator..... fucking negotiate you slack ass
@realDonaldTrump Has she read Mueller’s report?
@towner_terri @Cobra1A 39yo!   That must be a rough 39 years she’s had.
@joncoopertweets He knows words, he has the best words!!!
@aliasvaughn @TheRickWilson I check to see if he’s had a stroke.
@realDonaldTrump It’s ALL on you...... YOU
@OurFatherChaos @BridgetPhetasy Well there’s irrational and then there’s too fucked to be irrational.
@theheraldsun The beetrooter strikes again!
@BridgetPhetasy Pedophobia is actually a real fear of babies or children. It’s not what some think it to be.
@realDonaldTrump And were recovered after the technical fault that caused it to happen was discovered. The lies you tell......
@SRuhle $
@AlexanderDowner @FatherBob You got that fucking wrong.
@cricketcomau I guess all that talk of the wicket has disappeared.
@RWPUSA There’s nothing she can do to pass the CR in the Senate.
@Brasilmagic Was he trying to get rid of the mistress? Who the fuck wants to see some old fat cunt have a flog?
@michaelcburgess @AllenWest @MarkDavis You sounded like an absolute fucking idiot on TV with Chris Hayes. I was embarrassed for you..... actually, I was more embarrassed for your constituents. Mexico is NOT going to pay for the wall. You moron.
@AriMelber You’ve overthought this.
@realDonaldTrump Lol.... what a dickhead you are.
@Wes_Giles @realDonaldTrump Putin? Jong Un? Erdogan? MbS?
@TrumpsareNazis @LesleyE02634258 He’s not really running the country. It’s running itself from memory, bouncing off the kerb as it careens down the street. Captain Wrongway thinks he’s steering the ship, but it’s an illusion.
@_miss_liss @9NewsAUS I don’t think he thought was too good. He got immediately transferred to a more secure prison.
@_miss_liss @9NewsAUS I knew a bloke who got caught (breaking) walking back into Morwell River prison farm after a night on the turps with his other half in Boolarra.
@HillaryWarnedUs They are fun to trigger tho. I mean..... really fun.... they go off their heads.
@democracynow Did anyone ever think his heel spurs were real?
@Mimirocah1 Data doesn’t lie, Cohen has a propensity to though.
@juliaioffe Other nations should ban the import of US crops and let Agent Orange know why.
@TheRealBozza1 @masonsixtencox @howie0038 Not sure Howie would be all that enamoured with Paine.
@ellievan65 @smilon713 Is it possible such a moron could be electable? Apparently so! It was a train wreck interview for this idiot. But he probably thinks he was doing the right thing which makes it even worse.
@LenaghanAndrew @jmartNYT @melbournecoal Pfft. He will be swamped in the primaries by a number of younger options. He couldn’t even beat an unpopular as poor campaigner in Clinton. All he will end up doing is being a spoiler which could throw the election to Trump again.
@7NewsMelbourne Allied Mills in Tullamarine make them 52 weeks a year.
@relisberg @chrislhayes How did that moron ever get elected? It was the worst interview I’ve seen in a long while.
@HeyfromChe @SarahRubyWrites @Twhylightzone Definitely looks to have his own vote.
@kathrynresister @JeannieG40 She is Be Rest
@PassTheSalty @Cruellaisdevine Stop thinking.... not a top thinking...
@thehill I’m sure he sees many things in his imagination.
@PassTheSalty @Cruellaisdevine Needs to get over himself and a top thinking about who others are screwing and just deal with his own situation.
@samanthamaiden @australian @davidwarner31 Smith was weak in his inaction, but can anyone really doubt that Warner drove this whole thing? Warner has to cop his lumps. But we are really just re-living a discussion that was had 9 months ago.
@MichaelCohen212 What about the fall?
@Brettclo @BravenakBlog If only those 3.7 million more votes HRC got didn’t count!!!
@jmartNYT @melbournecoal He will run. He won’t win the nomination.
@SRuhle It’s just the moron’s version of Watergate.
@DLoesch I thought you were here courtesy of Russia.
@BadFoxGraphics @FoxFriendsFirst @FLOTUS @FoxNews The first 6 minutes and 54 seconds being their best content all year.
@ABC Code for: ‘I was shitting myself’.
@Karoli I believe it works in their favour in the long run. If they give a little bit of credit for this, they can then say they aren’t totally biased against him when they rip into him for the other 99.9% of the time.
@australian He’s out of his depth
@ErykBagshaw @theage @smh Morrison would have consulted with Andy on what to say about Pamela Anderson
@TeaPainUSA He has to recover from his traumatic time at the front
@FreeBeacon Looks like he’s had 10 losing rounds with the ugly stick.
@ChetTuckerman @TheRickWilson 706 days...... a profile in courage.
@coldlunch @rharris334 @theheraldsun He thought the ‘Gday mate’ would be his passport to anything he desired. How could she resist?
@Kris_Sacrebleu He couldn’t get in or out of that car now.
@WalshFreedom 706 days it took fake heel spurs to do it. A profile in courage!!!
@WalshFreedom So, for the first time in a long time, he chooses to be honest...... and this when he chooses to be!
@9NewsAUS 25 years!!!! Really? Not ‘never to be released’? Really?
@politico I particularly like her revisionist ideas of Germany and the US working together in WW2!
@WestCoastMacero @CheriJacobus I’ve heard of her. You..... not so much.
@MollyJongFast At least she’s keeping her clothes on in this one.
@ChrisCuomo When does he get his Purple Heart for all the butt hurt he displayed over there?
@CheriJacobus This caller has experienced a shutdown of their brain.
@WorldOfMarkyD @Cobra1A So, it’s close then.
@MsMollyRachael Small feet
@JonLemire I thought he said America was great again!!!
@couriermail @deemadigan They are clueless
@realDonaldTrump Why is everyone laughing at America then?  Maybe it’s you?
@RWPUSA Of course Corker could have been far more proactive in censuring Trump whilst he was actually in the Senate. All too little, too late.
@mishmashmisty @SkyNewsAust Lets see him cure cancer first.
@RadioFreeTom The KFC menu
@WalshFreedom @realDonaldTrump Your president, your party, you voted for him and them. Own it.
@DavidJollyFL His scales have failed
@KariK484 @shannonrwatts The average low temp in the Negev desert in summer is between 16 -18 Celsius at night.  NEXT!
@RadioFreeTom Republicans are sworn to uphold their own electoral viability. Anyone wishing to remain a viable candidate in the future are too scared to make the first move against this shitshow of a president
@shannonrwatts They were off to Bethlehem to partake in the census. And the census was held in summer to accommodate the ability to travel further due to longer days. It wasn’t freezing cold.
@realDonaldTrump You lose money in a shutdown. You don’t make money.
@DianneandDaisy @Brasilmagic Sort of loses its comedic value if one has to qualify it to that extent.
@ReneeLibby2 I haven’t spoken to my GF for 9 weeks!! Still not long enough.
@RadioFreeTom A profile in courage.
@JoyceWhiteVance Yep, mine did that to my remote and a pair of ray bans!!! Gotta love them..... gotta....
@RandPaul She’s talking to your neighbor.
@MichaelAvenatti @MalcolmNance @AlanDersh He’s just a tool.
@Brasilmagic Wharton business school graduate obviously!
@realDonaldTrump Learn to spell, you nimrod.
@Crow30Darkness @9NewsAUS What a lot of bullshit. He’s supposed to be a unifying force. He said he would be at his inauguration. But he tells people to rough others up, tells cops to treat people roughly, mocks@the disabled.......
@fran_mac75 @GregDuchesne @NancyPelosi https://t.co/3sIDXPrHNi
@fran_mac75 @GregDuchesne @NancyPelosi He had a $25 billion offer 16 months ago and knocked it back. Stuff him.
@BillKristol Christmas 2018 could be his personal Vietnam where he feels he pays the ultimate sacrifice..... 2 weeks of golfing.
@9NewsAUS He can’t even prevent the fighting going on in his country.
@GOPChairwoman They will do what’s right and vote NO
@ZerlinaMaxwell @ShilethaSnoddy Can ya spare some for a chromy?
@Peter_Fitz Tony Abbott waiting to see if he gets a mention probably.
@ProudDemResists A sewer
@ABC Sue him
@BillBillshaw @vanOnselenP @ScottMorrisonMP Tony Abbott
@AngelaBelcamino A bridle
@realDonaldTrump A better effort than Bill O’Reilly’s I guess.
@TalibKweli @TheFeltyPerro @Jabbawa78 Where the hell do you start with this bullshit?
@MHornsby16 @nickiknowsnada It could be called ‘unhinged’
@jmartNYT That should keep the big consignment of drugs out!!! What about the smaller lots?
@deemadigan Haven’t done Xmas for over 25 years. It’s quite liberating being divorced from everyone’s manic angst.
@soulphoodie @aprilbaxter Lil eggs, bacon and cheese muffin?
@hughhewitt @chuckschumer Trump doesn’t want the wall, he wants the outrage from his deplorons that the wall is being ‘prevented’ from being built.
@BillOReilly She will probably outlast you .
@rohan_connolly They’ve still got 9 days to get one right!!!
@ABC Needs a couple of boots to the ribs
@KatrinaPierson Go back to shoplifting, you’re far better at that.
@thistallawkgirl Choke
@marcorubio Obviously didn’t read his letter.
@thehill The 1970s called and they don’t want you either.
@SRuhle @chrislhayes @maziehirono I thought it was unusual then I thought nothing is unusual today. So it seemed pretty apt especially hot on the heels of Kasie Hunts dropping the F bomb in her tweet
@TeaPainUSA Yep, 25th has to be being talked about by GOP senators for sure now. The soon to be Dem house offers them an window of opportunity now, they don’t have to act in isolation. But they got to convince the cabinet. If there’s any left!!!
@postpolitics Of course, he still gets paid and has his medical still provided.
@JakeSherman Not if you’re a GOP congressional who has no job in a few weeks. You just get on the plane regardless.
@abbydphillip A new ‘charity’ fund.
@TimWilsonCPA @kasie @jwgop It’s needed in every sentence I utter, since ......... a fucking long long time ago.
@CJPatruno It would just save him time and a lot of effort if he just let us know when he said something correct.
@BelindaJones68 I have thoughts on what the ‘C’ stands for.
@kasie @jwgop Kasie....... working blue. Love it.
@maggieNYT But but but....... he the best negotiator!!
@revrrlewis Pelosi is going to play this moron like a champion. Putin will be jealous at her level of mastery.
@NBCNews He’s your president. Own it.
@abcadelaide Disgraceful
@9NewsAUS They’ll be flying in dent pullers from around the world for this lot.
@TheRynheart Looks like a seismograph signed it.
@RandPaul Putin pulling the strings. Paul being a willing puppet in the charade.
@knotsinmyhair Nah. Someone doesn’t know what they’re talking about.
@SkyNewsAust So what Barnaby is saying is that cover up is institutionalised within the NP.
@australian Is he saying he joined a ‘Marxist’ party willingly in the first place?
@HillReporter Won’t happen, but if it does, Trump nominates someone and then we get to see how obstructionist the house is going to be. It potentially would be viewed in bad light if the House blocked the will of the elected president.
@mcginty_billy @SkyNews Pfft. 30 is warm. 40 plus is getting a little bit hot.
@SkyNews Who needs a pool in England? Does it get over 30 degrees?
@sallymcmanus @deemadigan Needs to be seen as the hero of the downtrodden
@RandyResist Nope. Not any time soon. He may eventually, but he’s still riding the bumps as they currently are.
@TheBeatWithAri If only the judge could organise a recording of ‘lock him up’ to play before he finally does announce his sentence.
@deemadigan Family values!
@KimStrassel Because being accused of near treasonous behaviour is really just dancing around the issue!!! Do you believe this shit you try and get others to believe?
@JudgeJeanine Did your husband plead guilty to get away from you?
@PandaHulk_ @yashar Back then he was in his late 60s and probably indulged in a little blue pill.
@jdawsey1 We know Cohen was perfectly suited to being Trump’s lawyer for over a decade.
@McFaul My theory: he’s as dumb as dogshit and as ignorantly arrogant as Trump.
@realDonaldTrump He’s lagged you in good and proper.
@latikambourke @rharris334 Can they do it from home? Imagine how much we would save if they didn’t have to travel to Canberra!! They could actually get another job and do this for free!
@bruce_haigh @Cobra1A But .... in the mean time?
@newscomauHQ Needs Metamucil
@stonecold2050 Melodour
@vanbadham @Cobra1A As in a lot of politics, if they say it, they know some will believe it.
@julie_kelly2 Projecting your fantasies on to others doesn’t make them acceptable.
@SkyNewsAust @AlboMP Yeah, that will convince all current nations with nuclear armaments.
@deemadigan Where’s Michaelia Cash?
@SarahBurris Nah. Let them rot in jail and when he’s out of office, he can join them. America needs to see this lot have the law applied to them as it is to everyone else.
@gehrig38 @PressSec Toronto has a comedy festival. I take it that’s where you’ll be appearing?
@australian The Beetrooter has some serious competition.
@SocialPowerOne1 He’s got the emotional intelligence of a 12yo

@YaThinkN @Cobra1A Cough Troy .......cough
@leftocentre @Cobra1A 2 bullshitters in a paddock.

@LesStonehouse @Cobra1A ‘Gday mate’!!!! Strewth!
@MartinkusJohn @SarahRubyWrites Rita lives in ‘Mownt Maaarthar’, she will tell anyone who’s asks...... over and over. She doesn’t need a GPS, the route home is burnt into her psyche.
@heraldsunsport Too funny
@australian The Libs are making these things up hoping that idiots believe if just because they’re said it. And some will.....
@australian Subsidies for farmers and certain industries?
@SuzanneCASS3 @HumanHeadline @rosscoulthart @MayneReport @smh I think he’ll be squirming as the NP look to make a sacrificial lamb of someone for their accumulating indiscretions.
@BradMossEsq I have none and I feel qualified to say when whatever you’re trying isn’t working .
@Redpainter1 @MollyJongFast It’s mould
@Emolclause @smilon713 Rachel Maddow has been chasing this story for a long time. The things she suspects going on!!!! Good viewing.
@joandjames @SkyNewsAust FAMILY VALUES party.
@PatsKarvelas Sounds like he’s been doing some experimenting with ‘god’s plan’
@australian Looks like he’s been on the turps
@PatsKarvelas But but but..... FAMILY VALUES!!!
@Strandjunker @realDonaldTrump My guess is that he hasn’t been arrested for fraud yet.
@thedailybeast But but but ...... ah forget it...
@ccwhip According to Rudy’s rules of legal peril, no one got hurt, ok, someone got robbed...... but you know..... puts it at a second rate crime level maybe!
@HumanHeadline @rosscoulthart @MayneReport @smh Looks like Troll Rolling covered all the hate bases in that message. I wonder how his festered season is looking now.
@joshtpm Rudy might want to have a read of the Federal Election Campaign Act 1971
@neeratanden I find women who swear at me situation normal.
@greg_doucette @soledadobrien What the hell did she think was going to happen after doing that?
@brianstelter Why bother? They lie, they lie about their lies........ it’s horrible to watch.
@whatbabytalk @adallasqtpie @JohnLyonTweets I can appreciate talent even if it’s not my cup of tea musically. But she’s even lost that distant appeal to me now.
@whatbabytalk @adallasqtpie @JohnLyonTweets I want to brush my teeth after I see her because her saccharine sweet act leaves a film on my senses.
@whatbabytalk @adallasqtpie @JohnLyonTweets She makes me cringe. She’s an industry built to be self serving. Worst part is, others indulge her.
@adallasqtpie @JohnLyonTweets Cannot stand her.
@TheRynheart @smilon713 @RudyGiuliani When’s the funeral?
@Lawrence Yeah, he knows what’s he’s saying
@KaitMarieox The NRA can’t afford a $5 Barbie anymore, Russia has stopped the funds .
@davidmweissman To put you off your food.
@Dangchick1 HRC should have kicked him in the plums
@hughriminton Another NSW centric decision for starters.
@rohan_connolly Will could’ve suffice?
@Ian_walton1 @BevanShields @thebettinaarndt @JNampijinpa @MargaretCourt @RitaPanahi Eva Braun not being available or eligible of course.
@Peter_Fitz @HumanHeadline @AusRepublic Get rid of this nonsense once and for all.
@thistallawkgirl @AngelaBelcamino Crimes against fashion!!!
@PattyArquette @smilon713 I don’t indulge in it. It’s liberating not to have to.
@9NewsAUS @ScottMorrisonMP The role of GG could be performed by a carbon rod with a capacity to place a mark on a piece of paper. Because in essence, that’s all they do.
@AFL They’re trying too hard. No matter what you do to dress up a turd, it’s still a turd.
@EternalSaint @9NewsAUS @billshortenmp How is that hypocritical? What part did Shorten play in her getting the job?
@9NewsAUS He might muster 3% care factor!
@Bufshuf @elle_bee_are @higgens_tom @MollyJongFast It’s getting bit technical for a country boy!!
@GrayConnolly @vanOnselenP What’s a former soldier going to do that another well regarded person from a different field can’t do? Are you expecting military manoeuvres in Yarralumla?
@MollyJongFast It wasn’t just her kidneys. Her whole face looks completely different to what it looked like as a teenager.
@PressSec @AprilDRyan He says he doesn’t like his boss.
@mommamia1217 So when will he flip?
@briantylercohen The shit these flogs said about Michelle Obama..... they’ll rot in hell if there is one.
@Kris_Sacrebleu @3L3V3NTH It has been suggested that Mueller wasn’t satisfied with Trump’s written answers and has tried to subpoena him and this was the hearing to determine if a subpoena would be issued.
@willsommer Nah...... Corsi a scammer!! Nah, surely not!!!
@9NewsAUS The yanks always had trouble defending against tunnels.
@Barnaby_Joyce No worries. I’m ready.
@9NewsAUS So it’s a nothing position because he opened his stupid trap in a by election he was always going to lose. He really is in over his head.
@GeorgePapa19 Congress already has coffee providers.
@WalshFreedom If it’s a state school, then keep your religious shit at home.
@ScottMStedman Whatever happened to that?
@thedailybeast We have an expert opinion here!!!
@gtconway3d @senorrinhatch He only did it because he made himself look like a twat by his sincerely heartfelt comments the other day. In his best Christian sentiments, he believes breaking the law is ok if it suits his political agenda.
@neal_katyal Hatch obviously doesn’t understand the elements that make up a crime. And he was a lawmaker!!!
@bobclendenin You could see from a long way out that for all his faults, Christie was always going to be too smart to take this shitshow job on.
@Voize_of_Reazon Coulter and Ingraham will
@smh @latikambourke The only leader worthwhile sticking with was Gillard. The rest shouldn’t have been leaders and deserved to be booted by their own parties and that includes Moronison
@JohnJHarwood @PhilippeReines I’m getting dizzy!
@ellievan65 He can now spend his retirement looking for that spine of his.
@chelseahandler Keeping it real!
@theheraldsun You just need to know how to cook with it properly. Luckily I know someone who is a dab hand at using the stuff.
@RealJamesWoods @chriskkenny I’ve seen her naked somewhere though........ I wonder where that was?
@ndrew_lawrence @swin24 The Mexicantonese
@Sherrishaw14 @treasonstickers @LindseyGrahamSC Working beautifully
@realDonaldTrump You’ve been given 2 years of passes. We can afford to give her one.
@MollyJongFast I’ve known plenty of chunky bagheads.
@thehill Comedy is like running water, it finds the easiest path.
@marcorubio You were warned about this yet you still voted for it. Own it.
@KaivanShroff I know a camera can add 10 pounds, I never knew it could also add 10 years!!!
@ginarush The only conscience vote that should occur is with the woman who has to make the decision. Make it legal in all states with a standardised term and let women decide for themselves.
@tenblueiz @AprilDRyan Lol..... OWNED!!!
@jonathanvswan He’s mad if he takes it.
@matthewamiller Donny has had a good month!!!
@TheRickWilson It was written by a Mexican!!!
@ViceUmbrage @TheRickWilson You’d think after 25 years, these aggressive Republican prosecutors and investigators would be able to land a charge on her..... lol
@TeamPelosi Walking away like an assassin.
@atDavidHoffman Too cold. Bugger that, I’ll stick with Australia.
@CREWcrew @AllResistNews I cant $ay why!
@politico @thomaskaine5 They have 2 weeks to achieve exactly the same thing they have achieved in 25 years of investigating the Clintons.
@AprilDRyan She’s obviously not ‘be best’ at the moment.
@pgmckim @EEhite @SouthDallasFood @CaslerNoel @TomArnold Disclosure is a perilous process when you have a lot to hide.
@EEhite @SouthDallasFood @CaslerNoel @TomArnold Because if Trump sued, he would expose himself for being a drug addled moron.... which we all suspected, but couldn’t confirm.
@Morning_Joe The same ones?
@samanthamaiden @AnthonyFisherOP @ScottMorrisonMP 2 days after ‘he who can’t be mentioned’s’ conviction!!!
@rohan_connolly Abbott deserves an honour mention with his $7 co-payment whinge at the G-20 followed by knighting some old pommy geezer.
@DrDenaGrayson @GOP @SpicyFiles @thespybrief He really should shave that scone.
@artist4ever Yell ‘ look over there......... a camera crew’
@AdamParkhomenko Without doubt, this has been the most entertaining episode in political dramas ever witnessed. Consequential for many yes, but if this were a TV show, you couldn’t script it because there’s been a drama a day.
@RadioFreeTom @WalshFreedom All GOP do because you allowed the Tea Party to hijack the party and take it from being an economic rationalist party to ideological right wing loony haven.
@kylegriffin1 For so many years I never believed in Christmas....... this year seems different!
@SRuhle Maybe those 10 terrorists are perfect for the COS job. That’s a synergy that works.

@realDonaldTrump Walls built inside your vacuous head don’t actually count.
@Redpainter1 @boris3324 I couldn’t relate to them if they didn’t!
@MikeCarlton01 @Cobra1A Can you have two bullshitters in the same paddock?
@realMatMolina @GOP .....and if Trump resigns and Pence pardons him...... the system isn’t working. The state of partisan politics has prevented the congress providing proper oversight of the executive. The system isn’t working.... and too much damage is being done until it does work if it does work
@jentaub That’s a shame.....
@SethAbramson There may be a special place in Siberia for some NRA folk, just waiting for them.
@JoshButler @vanOnselenP @10NewsFirst But he doesn’t want to be a cowboy!
@PhilippeReines He’s surely too smart to take this shitfest on.
@CNNSitRoom @Acosta Not a fan of Christie,  it surely he is too smart to take this on and the inevitable legal costs he will face as he undoubtedly would end up being subpoenaed as most close to the idiot are.
@kylegriffin1 Shoot from the mouth, shot in the back!!!
@soledadobrien Of course offering her a chair would have been too difficult.
@Acosta There are only so many masochists out there, doesn’t he know that?
@WalshFreedom He gets it alright. He’s panicking in plain sight. I reckon if the writing is on the wall, he resigns and gets Pence to pardon him. Hopefully NY state has been doing its homework and goes at him and his family harder than it’s ever gone at anyone. He needs to be seen in jail.
@George_Ganitis @KrangTNelson That’s funny, when I lived in suburban Brisbane, backing in to 5 acres, I had, snakes, cane toads, bush turkeys. Goannas and all sorts of lizards, fruit bats, possums and koalas. Every day..... on a 1/4 acre block..... suburbia.
@ZoeTillman I hope any potential 2020 campaign staffers read this.

@B34NS @cenkuygur @realDonaldTrump Don’t you sometimes wish you hadn’t hit send?
@DrCraigEmerson He knows words, he has the best words.
@mikememoli I think he’s right there. He needs to be voted out in a landslide. A decision of the people for the people.
@neal_katyal @gtconway3d He will be looking up the statute of limitations on many things soon to see if running again is essential for his ongoing liberty.
@ABC Built like a brick shithouse.

@theheraldsun An electoral disaster is ideal circumstances for Abbott. In his eyes, it makes him a more palatable Lib leader.
@Wethepeoplehope JFK. I was born a week or so before the Cuban missile crisis.
@realAliTweets @DonaldJTrumpJr Nah, I reckon all the big name indictments will be the final act. Mueller goes after the peripheral players which won’t be enough for Trump to go nuclear.
@mkraju They are on tape saying it was a deliberate act to suppress.
@jymbo916 @HillbillyTruth @TheRickWilson The G whiz spot!
@RudyGiuliani What lawsuits?
@abcnews @TimWilsonMP @PatsKarvelas They’re already self harming.
@samdastyari @Cobra1A And happier
@bennoba @theheraldsun Oh dear.... a fan boy!!!
@bennoba @theheraldsun Pfft.... who gives a rats what Assange says. It’s what evidence Mueller has. Assange is hardly a credible source for anything but feeding cats and hiding.
@bennoba @theheraldsun We don’t have too much evidence? But there is some public. But what do you know what Mueller has? He already has a sealed indictment for Assange. There is stuff there ready to go. The collusion stuff will drop pretty much all at once. This is going to be hilarious.
@bennoba @theheraldsun Too funny. We have Trump publicly asking the Russians to hack. We have Don Jnr meeting with Russian govt officials. There is a lot of surface evidence. The nitty gritty is going to come from 70 hrs of Flynn interviews etc etc. 70hours!! They didn’t meet to have scones.
@bennoba @theheraldsun The collaboration with a foreign government charges, if any, will come last. There are sealed indictments as we already know, they probably are in that lot. Mueller is cleaning up the crimes that have arisen external to collusion.
@realDonaldTrump Actually Germany spend 1.24% and the US spends 3.6%. Germany like all other NATO nations have vowed to increase to 2% by 2024. The US spend is not all in NATO, it’s spread amongst all its worldwide military operations.
@Stop_Trump20 Blowhard and the deadbeats
@pattonoswalt 60 million voted for him, so 31K in comparison hopefully means there are less deplorons now. But unfortunately I doubt that to be the case.
@ellievan65 Disgraceful
@neal_katyal @richardwolffedc At some point he and prose should talk about how they are going to pursue him so that he does serve the rest of his life in jail upon leaving the White House.
@SocialPowerOne1 Good in theory, but there is no willing part of government oversight capable of making it happen.
@SRuhle It’s bizarro world.
@WashingtonPoint @joshua_landis He’s pissed off they’re not paying the ferry man
@llsed31 @TheRickWilson The deplorons will not be happy today. Seems to be a fair amount of collusion in the air.

@kathygriffin That’s a good rig.
@realDonaldTrump The Dems got 8.7 million more votes in the house than the GOP. That alone should make you shudder after all you did say this was a referendum on you!!!.
@AaronBlake Trump undoubtedly can do it, whether it had legal implications is another matter.
@friesenfan12 @NicolleDWallace He won’t even be elected dog catcher.
@washingtonpost Bizarro world!!
@WalshFreedom He might get around to it after he’s finished draining as many bank accounts of others as he can.

@TomArnold @simonamangiante @GeorgePapa19 14 days!! He’s probably spent more time in Russia conspiring against American democracy than this.
@JohnJHarwood ‘No collusion’, ‘Hilary’s emails’, ‘stable Genius’, ‘bad hombres’........ anything.... anything to deflect!!!
@TJMack83 @PhilipRucker @DavidNakamura 250 metres each way, with 5 minutes between each ‘sprint’!!! He’s definitely high energy!
@Fly_Sistah @jonathanchait @yashar Does Pence really know anything? Ever?
@JoshButler Do they think through this stuff before they open their mouths?
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Yeah.....nah
@renato_mariotti A long time ago...... what’s your point?
@JacobAWohl Stuck to defrauding people. You might not be any good at it, but infinitely better at it than this sort of analysis.
@JohnWren1950 I go to Sydney occasionally just to remind myself why I live in Melbourne.
@FredDugan @1AEDWM @kl_cole @fawfulfan Liberalism: a philosophy based on liberty and equality. Which part of that offends you again?
@1AEDWM @kl_cole @fawfulfan @FredDugan They’re all crazy, whether they shoot up a school or a church, picture theatre, shopping mall, nightclub etc etc. their motivations may differ, but the outcomes don’t. But undoubtedly, there has been mass shootings because someone’s god didn’t meet their expectations of god.
@TheRickWilson Scott free?
@rhysam As bad as the Harold Holt pool?
@johnrobertsFox Opportunity
@SerenityFoods @mtracey The Dems won the popular vote with him running interference anyway. At the end of the day, if people want to vote for him as a 3rd party candidate, you have to respect their wishes. Democracy isn’t necessarily perfect outcomes. It’s meant to reflect the will of the people.
@Patrickesque Aha!!! A corporate ‘democrat’!!
@EricTrump @KellyannePolls She’s a liar and he isn’t.
@GovMikeHuckabee Your son tortures animals.
@TheRickWilson Che GueVermont
@MattMSr @NancyVolle @mtracey Che didn’t beat HRC, so it’s moot. And he won’t beat a populist that’s likely to win the Dem primary in 2020. But he will get a ribbon for participating...... again.
@MattMSr @NancyVolle @mtracey We already have found out. He lost to an unpopular candidate by 3.7 million votes.
@MattMSr @NancyVolle @mtracey But labels are what define politics and he’s labelled himself with the second most unelectable label going. Communist being the most unelectable label. Americans aren’t nuanced enough to distinguish between the 2. He’s made himself unelectable with a word.
@MattMSr @NancyVolle @mtracey Any other obscure sources? If you think the word liberal is a dirty word in American politics, the term socialism is akin to calling your mother the C bomb. He’s unelectable.
@MattMSr @NancyVolle @mtracey You keep telling yourself that. Trump at 35-38% is more popular than a wannabe socialist. And Trump is a disaster.
@MattMSr @NancyVolle @mtracey The only proof I need to see is your preparedness to back in someone who is unelectable against Trump. Trump beats a GueVermont candidacy. As much as Trump is an anathema to the centre and left, Che is an anathema to the centre and the right which is bigger. He’s unelectable
@fawfulfan Surely Che GueVermont gets eliminated early this time.
@adamcbest Che Guevermont is for free creamed wheat
@MattMSr @NancyVolle @mtracey “Prune Juice for everyone”
@MattMSr @NancyVolle @mtracey So you’re one of the deplorons..... even funnier.
@MattMSr @NancyVolle @mtracey 3.7 million!!! 55% to 45%........ If he lost by any more, they’d need to get the handicapper in to even up the contest. If it was a marathon race, he’d cross the finishing line after the closing ceremony.
@MattMSr @NancyVolle @mtracey It wouldn’t have been so bad if he’d got within a million or so..... but 3.7 million!!! He’s got to run again to make that 3.7 million up!!!
@MattMSr @NancyVolle @mtracey Ol Che is one more Democrat primary spanking away from being the Washington Generals of Democratic Party candidates. 3.7 million!!! Lol
@MattMSr @NancyVolle @mtracey 3.7 million!!! Lol. Che Guevermont, racist grandpa lost big time
@MattMSr @NancyVolle @mtracey Che Guevermont lost. Get over it.
@Nicoxw1 @myserenity69 Che Guevermont
@TheRickWilson There’s the disaster candidate, right there. And he’s not even a Democrat.
@MattMSr @NancyVolle @mtracey Here’s a fact, HRC won 3.7 million more votes than Sanders in the primaries. Do you need some preparation H to swallow that?
@CandaceTX So, it was an improvement on Helsinki then!
@ginarush Strewth, Qld has nearly moved into the 1980’s!!!
@BernardKerik @GeorgePapa19 You’re a convicted fraudster and lied under oath...... your opinion on another liar’s conviction holds no weight. Know your place.
@SCH451 @SkyNewsAust @SkyNewsRicho @TurnbullMalcolm Lol..... put Abbott back in and it’s a 3-5 point increase for Labor. However, a few One Nation morons might be inclined to vote for the Coalition.
@AndrewRoper5 @theheraldsun Gobbo for sure
@LordTalks @mtracey Either way you look at it, Clinton got 3.7 million more votes than Sanders in the primaries. He lost. What happened in the Nov election is another matter that won’t be addressed properly the way the electoral act is written. And I don’t see too much conviction to change it.
@PatsKarvelas What are they worried about? Dermal overload?
@MattMSr @NancyVolle @mtracey Lol, another kool aid drinker who still thinks the old man will walk into the Dems and win the nomination!!! Nearly as delusional as the deplorons.
@Zac_Petkanas The first day of Christmas is the 25th. I concede a little ground and allow for the 24th for decorations to go up.
@Helenhs If it were to happen and trump appointed a new VP it’s probably a moot point.
@miMelb @AleksDevic @theheraldsun The plot thickens
@jenbechwati @TurnbullMalcolm They gave him loyalty right up until the time they stopped giving him loyalty. Which was about 2 mins into his Prime Ministership.
@australian The wrong arm of the law.
@itsJeffTiedrich The mirror
@australian Maybe the LNP need to get the legislation right rather than some botch job they’re trying to pass. This legislation is flawed and dangerous.
@GovGoogles @rhysam A life support system for a lump of coal.
@justinbaragona @bad_takes He means a Trumpist, there’s probably plenty of traditional conservatives, just not many Kool aid drinking Trumpists.
@YaThinkN @SarahRubyWrites All that backstabbing has thrown his arm out.
@LordTalks @mtracey It’s not up to me to change anything. I deal with what is and what arises out of what is. Change the circumstances and I’ll deal with what arises out of that.
@Nicoxw1 @myserenity69 I said Sanders wouldn’t get the nomination yesterday and have been hounded by a plethora of butthurt sanders kool aid drinkers since. It’s quite amusing. They seem to be so invested in others opinions on the matter!!
@bohemiantoo @mtracey Only by you lot. Which sort of makes it worth it.
@bohemiantoo @mtracey Lol. You lot are certainly highly strung. This is hilarious.
@RhodesThom @EugeneEsch @NancyVolle @mtracey That’d be me.
@RhodesThom @EugeneEsch @NancyVolle @mtracey Yeah, in 2016 he romped it in!!
@Brasilmagic That’s one way to end your legal career.
@AnnikaCorbert @abcnews @Anne_Ruston @PatsKarvelas It goes beyond that. In Victoria, the haste to sell off power assets without any foresight for reacquisition if operators walk away has left the state in a precarious situation 20 years later. It’s negligence at its worst.
@NancySinatra Its going to be a Payless clearance sale, not just one shoe.
@dos350_legit Take it up with Isiah. God is in the bat off cave have a 5 knuckle shuffle over all that gay porn!!
@dos350_legit God loves all that stuff. After all he created sin, he loves it. Isiah 45:7. He’s a bit of a voyeur is my guess...... possibly repressed.
@dos350_legit Obviously you do, hence your Leviticus quote. It seems ol’ Levi’s opinion is very important to you. Jesus loves all sinners so they’re probably not too fussed. Seems all bases are covered.
@dos350_legit If Jesus is forgiving you, then he’s probably forgiving them too. After all you have been judged by the same person, Leviticus didn’t say one sin was worse than the other.
@dos350_legit I’m just amused that Leviticus sees you in exactly the same light as them. Have you become perfect yet?
@dos350_legit I don’t think about them. Why are they on your mind so much? Is there something you want to tell us?
@dos350_legit @abcnews Then maybe you should sort your sins out before delving into others. Get back to us when you’re perfect.
@dos350_legit @abcnews Have you ever worn cotton and wool together? Eaten any shellfish? Ever eaten a bit of fat off a lamb?
@EugeneEsch @NancyVolle @mtracey Sanders won’t get the nomination. It’s as simple as that. He might try, he will get some traction, but he won’t make it through to the convention. By then, the focus won’t be on Sanders and his butthurt brigade, it will be on defeating Trump.
@EugeneEsch @NancyVolle @mtracey The only ones talking up sanders are sanders supporters. Anyone else is actually looking beyond Sanders. A 79yo failed candidate isn’t going to beat a field of much younger, more electable candidates. In spite of what you need to believe.
@EugeneEsch @NancyVolle @mtracey 2016. In a runoff with an unpopular candidate, he lost. And in the wake of his loss, he did enough to piss off plenty. This time around, he won’t get as much traction, will be out of the race sooner. I’m sure you need to believe it will be different, but he won’t get nomination
@EugeneEsch @NancyVolle @mtracey Sanders will be out of the primaries a little earlier than 2016. Sanders supporters will then need to make a choice of being either obstructionists or joining in and voting to defeat Trump.
@EugeneEsch @NancyVolle @mtracey What we do know is that Trump has 35%-38% approval. Sanders doesn’t even have 50% of Dems, which puts him at less than 25%. He’s a definite loss candidate.
@EugeneEsch @NancyVolle @mtracey Your graphic means nothing coming into 2020. Everything has changed. The emphasis on what’s important to voters will be different. It won’t be about looking for a new type of candidate, it will be about who is going to beat Trump.
@EugeneEsch @NancyVolle @mtracey You’re thinking about a normal election with normal a normal R candidate. There is nothing normal about 2020. The emphasis in most people’s minds looking to beat Trump is who has the capability of beating him. A 79 yo candidate isn’t going to be what people want.
@EugeneEsch @NancyVolle @mtracey Whether you believe the whole thing is rigged or not is irrelevant. The voters emphasis in 2020 will be on who can beat Trump and what it takes for that to happen. Sanders is not going to capture the middle which is required to beat him. He will get pushed out of the contest.
@EugeneEsch @NancyVolle @mtracey He lost to an unpopular HRC. This time around a consensus candidate will emerge to push him even further out on the margins. The emphasis will be on who can capture the middle, moderates, disgruntled GOPers and never trumpers. Sanders won’t get those.
@EugeneEsch @NancyVolle @mtracey Conversely, Sanders didn’t have enough votes to win the Dem nomination and won’t again if he tries. You realise that don’t you?
@QuancyClayborne @smilon713 His absence.
@bohemiantoo @mtracey Seems to me, you can’t get over Sanders losing. Imagine the angst your going to suffer when he gets cast aside again in 18 months time if he tries to get on the Dem ticket.
@ClydeHaberman When outrage and shock is exhausted, all I can muster up is ridicule.
@ClydeHaberman I was actually trying to put the best spin on Trump’s tenure.
@ClydeHaberman I’ll miss the laughs?
@TonySheahan @jeffhornboxer @Anthony_Mundine @suncorpstadium He blinked and missed it.
@pattitweeting @NancyVolle @mtracey Good luck backing another loser
@pattitweeting @NancyVolle @mtracey I got the point, I’m just taking it where I want it to be. But my guess is if you find poms condescending, it’s because you’re not at their intellectual level.... just sayin’
@pattitweeting @NancyVolle @mtracey Ask them
@pattitweeting @NancyVolle @mtracey Great Britain by definition shows I’m right.
@pattitweeting @NancyVolle @mtracey Here.... listen to something relaxing https://t.co/OoxUACRTH0
@pattitweeting @NancyVolle @mtracey They end up defeated. Something you would identify with.
@pattitweeting @NancyVolle @mtracey That could explain your defeated view on life.
@KieraGorden @Cobra1A @barriecassidy That photo of the gutless walking past her will undoubtedly surface as an ALP ad before the election.
@KieraGorden @Cobra1A Maybe a lump of coal has better re-election prospects than Kelly.
@pattitweeting @NancyVolle @mtracey What is your favourite recipe?
@pattitweeting @NancyVolle @mtracey Good for you. Lol
@pattitweeting @NancyVolle @mtracey You hold onto that.
@MSNBC Why does MSNBC have this womp womp on at all after his CNN disgrace?
@abcnews @Anne_Ruston @PatsKarvelas It’s sort of all encompassing though. The Libs can’t function as a policy machine because the conservatives are preventing the party from formulating any coherent policies that deal with current issues and appeal broadly. The energy policy being a prime example.
@suenosdeuomi @NancyVolle @mtracey And they will all be voting not for a political philosophy, but will be voting to get rid of one clown. And they will most likely choose a consensus candidate that has BROAD appeal, not a marginalised untried political philosophy in the USA. Sanders won’t be the one.
@thatjeffbloke @Bowenchris @Cobra1A We can only hope.
@suenosdeuomi @NancyVolle @mtracey Stop it. You’re making me laugh and I’m supposed to trying to make serious here. In case you haven’t quite grasped this concept..... the party and the electorate will elect whomever is the most ‘popular’. It won’t be me making them more or less popular to them.
@suenosdeuomi @DudeHazard @NancyVolle @mtracey Lol..... do you think the framers deliberately had you in mind when they set up the whole system? Machiavellian barstards!!!
@Bowenchris @Cobra1A They will eventually win over those Hansonites even if it means they lose that inconsequential middle of the political spectrum!!!
@suenosdeuomi @NancyVolle @mtracey Yeah..... 40 seats sort of says the Dems are on the right track and Sanders whilst he has some appeal, he doesn’t hold the appeal of the entire party, or the middle of the political spectrum and he won’t be winning over winnable disenchanted GOPers.
@TurnbullMalcolm Moronison wants his version of the captain’s call. It won’t end nicely if he makes it happen.
@australian Can the Libs find any more ways of disengaging from public expectations?
@suenosdeuomi @DudeHazard @NancyVolle @mtracey My privilege extends to getting up and going to work. But that aside, you can sit their and sook about what doesn’t suit you, or try and enact change. If I’m happy with current arrangements that’s my prerogative. If you’re not, do something about it.
@suenosdeuomi @NancyVolle @mtracey The Dems have done a lot of reflection. They know what is needed in 2020. And it won’t be a move to the left. It will be trying to capture the middle and appealing to disenchanted GOPers and never trumpers.
@DudeHazard @NancyVolle @mtracey The Dems don’t win in 2020 by pushing to the left. They win by appealing to disenchanted GOPers and never trumpers and capturing the middle
@DudeHazard @NancyVolle @mtracey Lol. An unpopular HRC beat him. An entrenched field of actual Dems in 2020 will wipe the floor with him. The party learnt its lessons both with HRC and Sanders.
@DudeHazard @NancyVolle @mtracey It’s not going to happen any time soon. In the meantime Sanders needs the Dem party infinitely more than they need him. And he doesn’t stand a chance in their primaries this time around because of what happened in 2016. He will be eliminated early.
@DudeHazard @NancyVolle @mtracey People are free to vote for whomever they choose. But he is an independent, he should run as one.
@bohemiantoo @mtracey Lol. He’s not a Dem, he should join the party and stay in the party if he wants to be a Dem. But he sees himself as an independent and should run as one.
@Cobra1A I sort of hope the state exec overrides the branch....... it will be a shitfight worth watching then.
@pauldutton1968 @Loud_Lass It ain’t going to happen.
@DudeHazard @runclepennybags @01wise @mtracey If you don’t like the way the Dems are, don’t vote for them. There is no compulsion for you to vote for them.
@DudeHazard @NancyVolle @mtracey You don’t have to vote for him. Sanders wants to be independent, he should run as an independent.
@HumanHeadline @7NewsMelbourne @cassiezervos It’s almost as if crime never existed in Melbourne until recently !!! All that money spent for decades on police, prisons and courts!!!
@McneelJeffrey @thehill @HillTVLive He doesn’t seem to be accepting lies either.
@thehill @HillTVLive Answer the questions honestly.
@vanOnselenP It’s very short sighted and only prolonging any meaningful change that would benefit them in the long run.
@NancyVolle @mtracey He did enough damage to deflect disgruntled voters anyway. So in effect he did split the vote.
@bohemiantoo @mtracey It’s got nothing to do with her. It’s got to do with him choosing when it suits him to be a dem and when it doesn’t suit him. It’s all good when he wants to use their apparatus. If he wants the independence of not being a Dem, then run as an independent.
@Brasilmagic @kingofcapo Not even this number? https://t.co/ACcK7vwYj3
@AynRandPaulRyan @smilon713 And 50 years ago, America was landing men on the moon!!!
@mtracey He’s only a democrat when it suits his political opportunism and wants to avail himself of the party apparatus to achieve his personal political ambitions. It might not mean much to you, but it does to a lot of others.
@DrCraigEmerson That’s what they mean by Belgian waffle.
@kelly2277 @corvowine @realDonaldTrump “There’s no place like home, there’s no place like home......”
@jptrib1 @corvowine I hope there are some state implications arising out of them.
@krassenstein @corvowine Nope. The GOP senate is too rusted on to Trump’s wagon.
@abillyboy2 @airbnb_au Made me look.

@NRATV @OliverLNorth When you go to France to attend WW1 100 year anniversary commemorations and don’t turn up because it’s drizzling and don’t go to Arlington a few days later ......is that disrespecting men and women who lost their lives and limbs?

@Barnaby_Joyce @vanOnselenP I’m not sure you’re one to talk about judgement.
@KrisMurphyAL @thehill The time for action is never lost. Putin is edging and prodding. Bit by bit, a death of a 1000 cuts. One massive heave back the other way and he’d shit himself. He hasn’t got the capacity to take on NATO full on. His economy is in the shit
@KrisMurphyAL @thehill All that is tinkering around the edges. Putin wants to see what type of military response trump is willing to offer.
@KrisMurphyAL @thehill What’s now got to do with the past. Obama is living rent free in your head. You can worry about the past but it won’t deal with now and the future.
@BobAkerman1 5 kw system living alone...... I can’t remember the last time I paid a power bill.
@KrisMurphyAL @thehill So the answer is to send even less or to push back?  Putin has never had to answer to a push back on his expansionist plans. And his parlous economic state couldn’t stand any real concerted military conflict with NATO who without US still spend 6x more than Russia.

@TheDemCoalition To show Trump he’s much much smarter than Trump and his circus of fools he surrounds himself with.
@PassTheSalty @myserenity69 He will resign before being impeached. Impeachment is a futile exercise if the Senate won’t vote to remove, which they won’t given the current partisan state of affairs. But he most likely will make it thru to 2020 and not run again.

@bert_gilfoyle @TrueFactsStated The actual technical charges of treason can only exist when congress has declared war against a foreign nation. Any charges that may arise will have to come from things like the 1971 federal election campaign act, among other statutes.

@realDonaldTrump We all know he didn’t want to stay in your lousy golf club.... big effen deal.
@TonyHWindsor That was disgusting and craven.
@DailyMirror Big Smack
@CavalerieJohn @australian How’s the 1980s going up there?
@GeorgePapa19 @AdamParkhomenko Why the struggle to avoid going then?

@SWHTown30 @andylassner You can’t hate something that doesn’t exist. And I can’t be shagged hating the voices in your head.
@TonyHWindsor @ellinghausen Moronison
@ms45 @marilyn_ella @mar5mac @TomTaylorMade It’s a strange world out there, people get things in their head about how they can overly influence the process.
@Peter_Fitz @Cobra1A @ellinghausen It was, without doubt.... weak as piss.
@rhysam All that back stabbing threw his shoulder out.
@vanOnselenP I think the back and forth between Peacock and Howard was very dividing for the party.

@chriskkenny Kenny is blaming everyone until he gets one that resonates with enough people. Then he will run with that until a drover’s dog appears.
@KassandraSeven @BeSeriousUSA So what you’re saying is that there are 211 yes votes.
@SethAbramson @GeorgePapa19 Does it come in a pictorial format for George?
@MahomesGoat @thehill I think he’s relying on unrest. But unless he’s prepared to impose martial law and find a way to get the states to stop 2020 elections, it will all just be another show that he likes to manufacture. His only cards are psychological cards, he holds very few constitutional ones.
@MahomesGoat @thehill Hard to say if his pride will prevent him from standing down. But he definitely won’t stand if he knows he’s going to be beaten by an embarrassing margin in 2020. He’ll say he’s not standing as he’s fulfilled his agenda.
@MahomesGoat @thehill Yep, I don’t see any point in impeachment if removal by the senate is impossible as it currently stands. Just investigate the hell out of him, expose him as much as possible for his crimes and present them to the electorate for 2020.
@MahomesGoat @thehill True, but it puts more pressure on moderate GOP members to act one way or the other. The problem is if they act against trump, they get disendorsed, they act for trump, they lose the election. Only longer term senators are relatively immune.
@AhronYoung @SkyNewsAust A text!! Weak as..
@jimstinson @Elise_Jordan @RogerWicker Which part of acquitted confuses you?
@9NewsAUS I haven’t heard any hubris from Shorten. As Abbott did in 2013, Shorten is similarly letting the government of the day hang itself.

@abcnews @denisvnapthine @PatsKarvelas Poisoned chalice
@WaukeSlosh @BaltRevolution @axios I don’t think the law will catch up to Trump until he is out of office. He won’t run if he knows he will cop a humiliating loss.

@pdh1944 @vanOnselenP That was no accident.
@samdastyari @deemadigan I like how we’ve moved past Guy as the problem and gone straight to the root of the cause...... the need to be seen as so fiercely right wing so as to appeal to One Nation voters in one state! A winning strategy!!!
@lalbertian @rohan_connolly @Dossa75 The butthurt is strong in these ones.
@JacobAWohl You know they are spitting in your coffee, don’t you?

@vanOnselenP Is it possible not to win any seats?
@macsween_prue I take it you’ve been voting for years then!
@JohnWren1950 @Cobra1A @LiberalAus Conversely, I hope the federal Libs think it’s all state issues and continue on their merry way.
@slsandpet @Cobra1A His wife?
@marilyn_ella @mar5mac @TomTaylorMade I just whip out the drivers licence as soon as I walk up to the person on the roll. No questions asked after that. In and out in 3 mins when I voted early. It’s a small price to pay to keep democracy ticking along.
@billisdoing @cheryl_kernot Turnbull is A factor, the fact that he was relatively popular in Victoria!
@LastLaughBlog @rhysam If he keeps saying it, he’s hoping he will eventually believe it.
@rhysam Frydenberg did

@deemadigan @Cobra1A To be fair, that’s his audience.

@MikeCarlton01 @Cobra1A I hope not.
@vanOnselenP Keep thinking that. But I bet in the Liberal caucus room in Canberra, they’ll be very very worried.
@deemadigan Can we recommend him to head up the Liberal’s federal campaign?
@chriskkenny Ouch!
@SkyNewsAust @paul4frankston I did see a jaywalker the other week in Beach St though!!
@vanOnselenP So successful, his own party dumped him before the voters could!
@vanOnselenP In Victoria, that’s called a mitigation strategy.
@JacktheInsider The last Liberal national leadership caucus

@deemadigan Surprisingly, he actually spelt moll correctly! But the lack of a space, after the comma let him down.
@RadioFreeTom In a few years, you might actually fill an airplane with those who agree.

@Graetz77GD @corruptagenda @SkyNewsAust The sale by Kennett and Stockdale didn’t include a reacquisition clause which was recommended at  the time.

@Jordan24x7 @OHFScratch @AP It’s not $350 bill, it’s not even the $110 bill Trump initially boasted in 2017. The $110 bill was a wish list that they dangled in front of Trump that they may purchase. The last sales contract was $25 bill signed under Obama’s administration.

@WalshFreedom Nonsense. If all of a sudden you didn’t have one classification of gun tomorrow, would your life change other than the fact that theoretically you couldn’t kill 10 people a minute as opposed to maybe only killing 2 or 3 with what you’d be left with?
@StevenDonovan15 @DitchThaBitch @fzmichael @thedoggeneral1 @realDonaldTrump Speaking of losing, the orange pudding lost the house.
@williamlegate That’s like 1st prize in a lottery is one night with Donald Trump, 2nd prize is 2 nights.....
@fzmichael @thedoggeneral1 @realDonaldTrump Not to mention if they flip more state houses and legislatures in 2020, it will greatly effect electoral boundaries in 2021. This election will have long term positive electoral effects for the Dems.
@WalshFreedom Why aren’t citizens allowed to own nukes? Obviously they are too dangerous. So the government has already drawn an arbitrary line on what arms the citizens can and cannot own. So the discussion should be what arms are too dangerous, rather ‘don’t take my guns’.
@SRuhle @jonallendc @actvst Ouch

@GenMhayden Looks like his clay mask is crumbling
@parallaxer @20committee They’ll find a way to forgive HIM for that. Because their motives are purely revenge on those who have consigned their religion to the realms of irrationality. Therefore they will pay any price to strike back at them. And Trump is the price they’re prepared to pay.
@washingtonpost They slow videos down in sports telecasts. And they don’t try and doctor the video to support a false narrative to destroy someone’s career.
@realDonaldTrump Shitler’s prune juice hasn’t kicked in yet.
@Brasilmagic She’s used up her lifetime quota of lies?
@maggieNYT Trying to put some substance to her ‘me me me’ tour.
@davidmweissman Exactly. And given the government has already drawn an arbitrary line on what armaments citizens can’t have, there is precedence to limit what is legal. Scalia even said there was no guaranteed right to automatic weapons.
@DRStwo @LuciaRendn4 @kaitlancollins He doesn’t use wet checks either
@AnnCoulter Speaking from personal experience?
@VP @POTUS Trump fought from a distance, a dry hotel room, manning the trenches and tweeting and showing those Californians he knows it’s all their fault. Such courage!!!

@NickKristof He can’t find anyone to take the rap and cop the token execution they will undoubtedly perform to prove their sincerity.

@castledangerous @hardhouz13 He went wacky born again evangelical because RC was too mainstream for him.
@GeorgePapa19 I want a skinny latte with one sugar please.
@ScottMStedman His interpretation of the constitution is much like Trump’s estimation of his own wealth. It varies according to what he needs it to be on any given day.

@MichaelSteele @AprilDRyan @Yamiche @abbydphillip Black women represent 2 audiences that will inevitably bring him down and he’s angry at them because he knows it.
@AngelaBelcamino That he loves them....... because he said he loves the poorly educated
@MichaelSteele It’s a risk I’m prepared to take.
@SaukFish @paulwsj @jwgop @WSJ Whittaker sat in an advisory board of a company forced to repay $26 million. It’s no witch hunt, it’s a coven that’s been found already.
@JoeBarri Putin is lodging an appeal.
@seungminkim @GlennKesslerWP Donny just rewriting history to suit his narrative of victimisation.
@jeremyherb @LauraAJarrett They apparently have a contentious relationship and Rosenstein quoting Marburg v Madison earlier was a shot across Whittaker’s bow. But what else is Rosenstein going to say outright about his new ‘boss’?
@CheriJacobus Romney, Jeb Bush, Kasich...... force him to face a formidable field of candidates that may not beat him, but would distract him.
@PollyPepper16 @williamlegate @realDonaldTrump ..... are searched??? Is this a new form of English?
@packerpoppa @dirtbag_lawyer @MLevineReports @bradheath Mentioning Marburg v Madison is basically bashing Whittaker in a not too subtle dig at Whittaker’s nonsensical statement.
@politico Just what America needs, going from brainless to spineless!
@gfrantz95 @CBSNews What’s the matter Gazza? What are you hiding under that cap? A Ben Carson lobotomy scar? We all know Trump loves the poorly educated and you’re living (questionable) proof of why. Don’t get too upset, you’ll end up having a stroke yourself grandpa, if you’re not careful.
@marcorubio You think you’re god?
@realDonaldTrump Maybe election stealing Scott was hiding them!!!
@CillizzaCNN @abbydphillip He hates women, he particularly hates black women, especially those who question him.
@CBSNews One day we will watch him have a stroke nationally televised.

@RealappraiserSC @StephenGutowski @davidharsanyi Why don’t you just admit that children being mowed down in their classrooms is a price you’re prepared for them to pay for you to keep your guns. At least that would be honest.....

@RealappraiserSC @StephenGutowski @davidharsanyi https://t.co/RWnyHUjZto
@RealappraiserSC @StephenGutowski @davidharsanyi https://t.co/SVUur8OS5Y
@RealappraiserSC @StephenGutowski @davidharsanyi The NRA sues to defeat proposed laws in court. Not only in Cali. They don’t care about people dying, they are only concerned that their major industry backers aren’t affected by gun restrictions. Google NRA sues and learn something.
@RealappraiserSC @StephenGutowski @davidharsanyi They don’t get the implementation of measures they wanted. The NRA sued to prevent Prop 63. What gets proposed constantly gets hosed down or defeated by the NRA. They are happy for others dying so long as they keep their guns unfettered.
@RealappraiserSC @StephenGutowski @davidharsanyi I do know that if you do nothing, nothing changes. And you can still fulfill 2nd A obligations and limit inappropriate weapons in urban environments. As there are already statutory limitations in place on certain armaments with acceptance by most citizens.
@RealappraiserSC @StephenGutowski @davidharsanyi Then try more measures. And then more. The constitution says you have a right to bear arms. It didn’t mention all types of arms were guaranteed and Scalia said this also. And there are already arbitrary lines drawn on what armaments you cannot own.
@RealappraiserSC @StephenGutowski @davidharsanyi I’m suggesting gun control measures shouldn’t stop at one measure.
@davidharsanyi @RealappraiserSC @StephenGutowski Because the 300 million guns that currently exist are stopping these mass shootings?
@RealappraiserSC @StephenGutowski @davidharsanyi Imagine knowing guns kill and not trying to do something about mitigating the 13,000 plus gun murders every year!
@StephenGutowski @davidharsanyi Because prayer has worked in all the other thousands of mass shootings? At least he’s prepared to get past this notion of deity upholding American virtue when al it’s doing is masking massive social issues.
@Stop_Trump20 Womp womp
@TheRickWilson Cell block number nine
@KremlinTrolls Troops have been diverted to fight Trump’s war on truth.
@RudyGiuliani Back in 2000 you couldn’t wait to count ALL votes..... today, you only want GOP votes counted.
@miratalita8 @CNN All medical work done free.
@Salon How about Fox News guest demonstrate ?
@thehill How generous.
@JaneTribune @SarahRubyWrites Nup, no idea what it means.
@tonyschwartz It’s a quadrella of spinelessness.
@Brasilmagic They’re boot scootin’ not boot shootin’.
@MaryRWilliams4 I can see McCain’s thumb turning down on McSally and her votes on removing health care.
@emanumiller Brilliant, because even if it was staged, public speaking is a performance and it got the reaction intended.
@KevinGi62453362 @RadioFreeTom ......not to mention Prozac and Valium.

@AynRandPaulRyan @SocialPowerOne1 Saudi Arabia is probably the perfect place for her.
@RadioFreeTom They are Muzak, not music
@ImaniAmil @LindseyGrahamSC @ScottforFlorida Seems like the only crying being done is from you snowflakes melting. Maybe colder climes are better for you than Florida.
@RadioFreeTom Moody blues are a great band..... if you’re stuck in an elevator.
@jdawsey1 Meanwhile he’s looking at what evidence Mueller has and passing it onto Trump.
@glassmeg @politico Conceding has no legal status in determining the outcome. It’s only a custom of being a graceful loser.
@workmanalice @PatsKarvelas He couldn’t give a rats.
@ava I’m not sure which is better, McBath winning or Handel losing!
@mngolfguy23 @Karen04110206 @JackRottie @ABC The answer to a mental health issue surely includes not allowing those affected, access to guns.
@ljayes @GrogsGamut @SkyNewsAust This is the sort of issue that will have Morrison skolling beers at 8am. He’s clueless at the best of times, having to make a decision with real consequences will send him apoplectic.
@marcorubio Voter fraud is ok as long it goes the way of Rubio. If Scott and DeSantis still win after this count, will Rubio still be complaining?
@kitty4hawks @funder In this administration, his career is just getting started.
@JayRouseDC @DearAuntCrabby It’s not the way to protest against him. It does not further anyone’s cause except Carlson’s
@ShawnIsDynamite @PoBoyProphet @Teresaweaver93 @MarcACaputo @chrislhayes I put his early concession to Gillum being a man of character. Hopefully he gets the chance to govern similarly.
@DemWrite But happy with a philandering, self admitted sexual assaulter president!
@hrhacl @joshgerstein I heard that on MSNBC too.
@wcbs880 @CandaceTX Are there any bridges in DC with lanes worth closing?
@Popehat Doesn’t do anyone any favours except feed their fringe elements much in the same way Trump appeals to his lunatic element.
@scotusreporter @PhilipRucker Wrap her in cotton wool.
@mdornic @PressSec Sue whomever into oblivion.
@BishanBedi @SportingSpud Might be skilful, but not in the spirit of the game. Switch hitting isn’t the same because the bowler has still has all elements of disposal of batsman in play .
@whca He should sue for restraint of trade and discrimination.
@craigrick45 @TheRickWilson Are you releasing an English version of that tweet?
@molly_knight @RyanCostello Vulcan mind meld
@costareports He needs to put his big boy pants on and deal with it.
@TheRickWilson He’s getting the credit alright......
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Flipping the states is the start of fixing gerrymandering. It will have long reaching consequences.
@MeetThePress @realDonaldTrump I’m sure an auditor can figure it all out for Congress .
@WalshFreedom Where you moving to?
@jaketapper He can wrestle him for it.
@realDonaldTrump Don’t worry, Mueller is doing all the hard work for Congress now.
@mishmashmisty @SippinMyCoffee @TB_Times and your good friend Scott was running a company that was fined $1.7 BILLION for fraud. Who the fuck gets a fine that large?  Not to mention his shonky gasoline and train line dealings. He’s as crooked as dogs hind leg.
@mishmashmisty @SippinMyCoffee @TB_Times Trump increased the govt debt 80% in 18 months. He can’t mange money, never has been able to.
@mishmashmisty @SippinMyCoffee @TB_Times You seem to know more about these radical outfits than I do. I’m just a straight down the line, fiscal conservative who believes in a fair go for anyone willing to have a red hot go. But I do love hanging shit on zealots. It’s all fair in love and war.
@mishmashmisty @SippinMyCoffee @TB_Times Obviously reading isn’t one of your strong suits...... conservative... conservative. I typed that slowly for you.
@mishmashmisty @SippinMyCoffee @TB_Times You’d probably take whatever is on offer.
@mishmashmisty @SippinMyCoffee @TB_Times Scott looks like a skeleton with cling wrap pulled tightly over his head.
@kasek_15 @patm1972 @JacobAWohl Cmon dopey, have a think about it.... you nourish yourself on men’s tears, what other men’s fluids do you enjoy?  I support you in your alternative lifestyle.....
@wvjoe911 @CandaceTX Can someone build him a portable fence perhaps?
@williamlegate High motivation Maxine
@NewDay The crypt keeper is up early ....... or late!
@realDonaldTrump 37 seats flipping..... don’t worry, you’re getting the proper credit.
@NatashaBertrand The best result of the night.
@tribelaw @ManchuCandidate Mueller’s report to the house will contain enough information and evidence to make subpoenaing a pointless activity.
@Acosta @ManchuCandidate Mueller has them. The judiciary committee will have  his report and all evidence soon enough.
@KevinSMayfield @DeirdreAgain @dcpoll He was never up for election whilst under indictment.
@bleiby527 @fawfulfan Can you imagine what she’s saying behind closed doors! I bet it’s not pretty.
@allymutnick @dccc @NancyPelosi Pelosi kept the message on health care and it was a winning strategy. She’s a shrewd operator.
@joncoopertweets DACA.
@jeremynewberger Yes: Nancy Pelosi
@riromtz @stellaaaa Almost the best victory of the night.
@Guy4Good_69 @9NewsAUS The GOP were never going to lose the senate. They only had 1/3 of the field up for re-election. The danger laid in the house. And now the Dems have that, they being an equal branch of govt, have all this power denied to them for 2 years. A lot of things change now.
@Guy4Good_69 @9NewsAUS Oh you’re one of those clowns..... lol. Yeah sure.... cool story!!
@thedailybeast Nyet nyet nyet!! Say it’s not so!!!
@Guy4Good_69 @9NewsAUS Lol. What does having 55 senate votes do that 51 couldn’t? Keep it succinct.
@DonnaWithrow2 @maydaymindy9 It was the end goal. Pity for some state houses because they could have had remedied some illegitimate gerrymandering, but now the fight back gathers real momentum with some real consequences.
@JohnBerman @ConorLambPA He doesn’t sit on the judiciary committee, so he needn’t be concerned.
@Guy4Good_69 @9NewsAUS Means nothing. Unless he got to 60 senate seats to avoid filibusters, then a 1,2,3,4 seat margin isn’t going to change his senate position. Losing the house....... investigations, subpoena powers, budget, oversight in the hands of the Dems.... big implications
@LOLGOP @JeannieG40 A loud NYET was heard coming from the corn fields of Iowa
@adamcbest @JeannieG40 His comrade Rohrabacher lost though!
@breesophiebree https://t.co/0HRxoqyoUi
@OriginalJLP He’s stiff to miss out!
@BelindaJones68 @Cobra1A @drkerrynphelps @CraigKellyMP At least she’s doing something for people’s health. He’s just making people sick.
@missmayn @realDonaldTrump Wow, last I looked McBath was well behind. Fantastic result!!!!!
@deemadigan @ScottMorrisonMP Hillsong doesn’t count?
@timkennerjr @Putin_TrumpUSA @yashar @SpeakerRyan @POTUS This isn’t a victimless situation. You might come in 7th.
@anneapplebaum @Teddy_Stache Nunes and King  would have been good too, but you’d take this ouster all day.
@timkennerjr @Putin_TrumpUSA @yashar @SpeakerRyan @POTUS Maybe Trump should say ‘America top half dozen’  1/ Trump 2/ $$$$ 3/ Russia 4/ His family ( tenuous and subject to change) 5/  bound to be a priority to him greater than America 6/ America ( subject to demotion)
@Putin_TrumpUSA @timkennerjr @yashar @SpeakerRyan @POTUS Obama isn’t in given anymore. Keep up. He’s living rent free in your head. NOW, back to ‘America first’...... what does that mean to you? Employing foreigners when Americans are available?
@Putin_TrumpUSA @timkennerjr @yashar @SpeakerRyan @POTUS I’m not the one who gets out on the hustings and says America first, meanwhile back in his businesses, it’s foreigners first.
@Putin_TrumpUSA @timkennerjr @yashar @SpeakerRyan @POTUS @NBA Lol, sounds like you’ve about to do a foofer valve. He’s not leading by example. America first except when it comes to his businesses.
@timkennerjr @Putin_TrumpUSA @yashar @SpeakerRyan @POTUS He’s employing foreigners. There are Americans who can perform these jobs foreigners are doing. It’s very simple to understand. Exhaust the supply of qualified American labor before looking internationally.
@Putin_TrumpUSA @timkennerjr @yashar @SpeakerRyan @POTUS Rohrabacher...... gone!! Lol. Mother Russia will be upset!
@Putin_TrumpUSA @timkennerjr @yashar @SpeakerRyan @POTUS He’s not leading by example. He loves the poorly educated for a reason. I’m sure you think he loves you.
@timkennerjr @Putin_TrumpUSA @yashar @SpeakerRyan @POTUS There are 6 million people who could fill those roles. Why is this MAGA leader using foreign labor?
@Putin_TrumpUSA @timkennerjr @yashar @SpeakerRyan @POTUS IL can say no. Why is trump giving jobs to foreign workers when those roles can be filled by the 6 million unemployed in the US?
@Putin_TrumpUSA @timkennerjr @yashar @SpeakerRyan @POTUS He hired 1 US citizen/resident for 144 jobs. One!!! One!!!
@Putin_TrumpUSA @timkennerjr @yashar @SpeakerRyan @POTUS All varieties of cuisine at Trump’s vanilla retreats are catered for by current US qualified people’s. I’m sure in the 325 million US citizens, he can find someone to overcook a rib eye fillet.
@timkennerjr @Putin_TrumpUSA @yashar @SpeakerRyan @POTUS He applies for foreign workers. Are you saying there aren’t 78 waiters and cooks in the US who couldn’t do that work?
@timkennerjr @Putin_TrumpUSA @yashar @SpeakerRyan @POTUS He applied to have 78 foreign workers at Mar a Lago. Aren’t Americans good enough?
@timkennerjr @Putin_TrumpUSA @yashar @SpeakerRyan @POTUS Why does Trump have so many non citizens working at his hotels?
@timkennerjr @Putin_TrumpUSA @yashar @SpeakerRyan @POTUS Tell that to your red states that refuse to lift the minimum wage like Alabama, Alaska, Idaho, Arkansas etc
@timkennerjr @Putin_TrumpUSA @yashar @SpeakerRyan @POTUS Education is a good start. Tariffs certainly doesn’t get you there when your margins are tight enough already.
@timkennerjr @Putin_TrumpUSA @yashar @SpeakerRyan @POTUS Or just become totally uneconomical and lose the market to overseas growers and producers. But hey..... he showed them!!! Lol
@timkennerjr @Putin_TrumpUSA @yashar @SpeakerRyan @POTUS You still can’t get people to do the jobs no one else wants to do. I suppose they can all go stand in the soy bean fields and watch them rot.
@timkennerjr @Putin_TrumpUSA @yashar @SpeakerRyan @POTUS You probably have a lot of employers who can’t operate.
@timkennerjr @Putin_TrumpUSA @yashar @SpeakerRyan @POTUS Tell that to 560,000 homeless Schulz
@Putin_TrumpUSA @timkennerjr @yashar @SpeakerRyan @POTUS Nunes undermined the Congressional intel house investigation. And now it has a chance to reinvestigate and interview those who never were subpoenaed deliberately by a nervous GOP committee. This will be an excruciatingly slow embarrassment for the GOP.
@Putin_TrumpUSA @timkennerjr @yashar @SpeakerRyan @POTUS Don’t you worry, more will be revealed soon enough . All indictments will have been tested by a grand jury. And now with subpoena power the Dems can rectify a few invesocut short by comrade Nunes. I see comrade Rohrabacher is 2200 votes down with 90% counted. Nyet nyet nyet!!!!
@Billbrowder @Rey_Sistance Nyet nyet nyet!!!!
@timkennerjr @Putin_TrumpUSA @yashar @SpeakerRyan @POTUS Have you read any outcomes of investigations? As far as we all know, they remain confidential. More contrived avoidance of your butthurt there.
@Putin_TrumpUSA @timkennerjr @yashar @SpeakerRyan @POTUS The Dems will play it smart. Give a fair bit of leeway budget wise but slowly strangle him in investigations. No impeachment because that’s pointless, but just embarrass him in the lead up to 2020 with revelations of his poor financial state and links to dirty money.
@Putin_TrumpUSA @timkennerjr @yashar @SpeakerRyan @POTUS More cutting and pasting from your rehearsed pretence of not trying to show how pissed off you are.
@Putin_TrumpUSA @yashar @SpeakerRyan @POTUS Lol. Cutting and pasting contrived nonsense. This is the reigns on Trump that he’s never experienced in life. It’s a good time to watch him have a prolonged drawn out apoplectic fit. How many shades can he go other than orange?
@Putin_TrumpUSA @yashar @SpeakerRyan @POTUS He won’t get his wall, not that I think he really wants it anyway. He just wants you fools to get angry over it.
@Putin_TrumpUSA @yashar @SpeakerRyan @POTUS And then it gets tied up in committee and ends up that Trump hasn’t got any free air to pass anything but basic spending. He doesn’t get his spending agenda.
@Putin_TrumpUSA @timkennerjr @yashar @SpeakerRyan @POTUS And the senate can’t get anything passed unless it it is word for word the same passed by the house!!! And as the senate is Trumps side of politics, they have to get the house to comply
@timkennerjr @Putin_TrumpUSA @yashar @SpeakerRyan @POTUS I see a house majority where they now control the budget and oversight of all govt activity and have subpoena power. All that losing!!!!
@Putin_TrumpUSA @yashar @SpeakerRyan @POTUS Even funnier..... you expect no budgets passed? Did you miss these very basic things at school?
@thedailybeast Stiff to miss out.
@JamilSmith Not the bleached blonde ones. The peroxide has gone too deep.
@Putin_TrumpUSA @yashar @SpeakerRyan @POTUS So, what you’re saying is that you have no expectations for any legislation to be passed in the next 2 years?
@DailyMail @MailOnline Covering the big issues!

@jpodhoretz Kushner won’t be happy about Christie as AG.
@JesKast @CandaceTX His soufflé just dropped!
@notthePOTUS123 @VictorB123 @SethAMandel Lol. It’s so fucking lost, the life guards have given up on it. But you said yesterday your lot would win it. What else do you fuck up so badly? Now for the subpoenas!!!!
@notthePOTUS123 @VictorB123 @SethAMandel The senate was never in doubt, but one seat, two seat margins in a house you weren’t going to lose...... excuse me while I yawn.
@MattWalshBlog .......if you don’t derive any joy out of some forms of social justice. If you do, many people’s lives are about to be enhanced.
@notthePOTUS123 @VictorB123 @SethAMandel Lol.... how’s that house looking? Do you need a map to find it? Seems you’ve lost it!!!
@brianstelter Tax returns first.
@DavidJollyFL Doorman
@JoeBarri @GOPisComplicit I won’t be satisfied until he is locked up.
@srpeatling @lenoretaylor He’s definitely gone Trump.
@SarahRubyWrites @michellegrattan It must linger around his mouth.
@katjhammo @AFLTrade @dmarchi91 Zorco apparently cheated on his partner. Not been verified.
@PreetBharara Trailers are hard to find late at night.
@mattklewis Thoughtful? She voted 96% of the time with Trump. So 4% non adherence is now thoughtful!!!
@kasek_15 @patm1972 @JacobAWohl Do you enjoy men’s fluids?
@patm1972 @JacobAWohl He will be crying yes.
@JacobAWohl You’ll be going to court too

@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @POTUS By stemmed, you mean built momentum for it?
@Nicoxw1 Why did his parents give him a Hebrew name?
@Peter_Fitz @Cobra1A You can’t have 2 bullshitters in the same paddock.
@BrettMasonNews @Cobra1A Obviously all that Hillsonging has worked wonders.

@Montemiletto93 My socialised medicine has killed me 3 times at last count!! Those barstard red commie doctors !!!
@SydneyLive2GB @PatsKarvelas @RealMarkLatham @BenFordham You can’t have two bullshits in the one paddock.
@MettaBhavana1 @PatsKarvelas @chiccomarx She won Oxley as a Liberal member.
@TheRickWilson @ManchuCandidate I thought backpage didn’t exist anymore!
@TimAlberta @RonBrownstein @IngrahamAngle He was close tho!!!
@realDonaldTrump Law enforcement are too busy keeping an eye on you and your criminal family.
@NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK They’ll choose Trump, proving once and for all that expedient outcomes far outweigh any contrived morality they try and portray.
@RozzaKat13 @dc5150319 @politico False flag. That’s how these things work isn’t it?
@Vintagesquirrel @MSNBC @JoeNBC He was accused of racism when he said he had more American Indian blood than those who sought casino licences.
@Vintagesquirrel @MSNBC @JoeNBC He was accused of racism when he ran a campaign to have 5 young African Americans falsely accredited with a murder
@Vintagesquirrel @MSNBC @JoeNBC Incorrect. He was accused of racism with his rental practices in New York in the 70s. Now I understand you need to rewrite history, but at least do some research before you spread this bullshit.
@notthePOTUS123 @VictorB123 @SethAMandel Yes you are. You’ll keep the senate, but the house will be enough to send Idiot Nixon into an apoplectic fit eventually with all his dirty laundry being exposed.
@notthePOTUS123 @VictorB123 @SethAMandel Shitler’s life becomes infinitely harder after losing the house. And he will become even more erratic. I don’t see him lasting the term before resigning. He’s not good under pressure.
@notthePOTUS123 @VictorB123 @SethAMandel I’ve found it, watching you feel intimidated by tomorrow.
@maddow Thrush isn’t one of America’s great thinkers.
@notthePOTUS123 @VictorB123 @SethAMandel It’s only fake for morons. Well done on that 👍
@VictorB123 @SethAMandel MSNBC said earlier that they open the polls in the mountains of New Hampshire at midnight.
@DailyCaller I didn’t realise thrush was still alive.
@realDonaldTrump Sovereignty? You are one part of three equal branches of government. The democrats as per of the democratic process are allowed to run for all three branches. There is no such thing as sovereignty in a federal presidential constitutional republic.
@JacobAWohl He should be awarded the purple heel spurs.
@robertdfrost @RadioFreeTom He pays taxes, he is a citizen, he can say what he thinks when he chooses to anyone willing to listen to him.
@toddgillman @joncoopertweets @tedcruz More than expected then?
@Lawrence All that winning!!!
@JillFilipovic He’s keeping it rl
@RadioFreeTom He doesn’t want to reMaine
@EmmMacfarlane They are basically centrists. But that’s considered radical left by American troglodytes.
@mitchellvii Are you on drugs?
@ChrisCuomo Actually, Trump has no control over his impulses.
@RadioFreeTom The GOP needs to be destroyed so it can be rebuilt. Trump is doing his part, voters get to do their part tomorrow.
@JacobAWohl Do you expect your poor future father in law to finance you ? It’s not his money.
@Niles85440275 @realDonaldTrump You’ve been reported as being a bot, so nick off Boris.
@weegee56 @realHirondelle @rupatho @dabeard @YoniFreedhoff They have weight restrictions.
@Niles85440275 @realDonaldTrump Oh yes, reported for being a bot account Vladimir.
@vanOnselenP He’s busy skolling a beer
@Niles85440275 @realDonaldTrump Lol.... Rasmussen!!! Why not Hitler weekly or the actual Fox poll as I asked for?
@rohan_connolly To be fair, Abbott, shitty political instincts played a huge role in his downfall too. You bet you are, you bet I am!!!
@Desardo1 @rohan_connolly Syntax is important.
@SkyNews What state of mind were the women in?
@realDonaldTrump Show us the poll.
@actual_chaos @simonamangiante How old is she again! 33 or 37? Just asking for ........ everyone really!
@stonecold2050 100% through prolonged exposure.
@asmith702 @DrDenaGrayson @JamesFourM @jzikah @thebax33 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump It would be the better part of him,
@pierceweekly @CrimsonTideFB @CNNPR @DonaldJTrumpJr They also played it, not as an ad, but as a discussion point, so the ban sort of became pointless.
@RawStory @lancegregmason A fool and their money is soon parted.
@DerekCressman @PrincessBravato Pardon me?
@WalshFreedom Are you saying Trump hasn’t used race, gender or sexuality as railing points during his tenure and prior? These stats are relevant.
@jaketapper Cough sexual assault cough
@realHirondelle @rupatho @dabeard @YoniFreedhoff The horse would need to be a Clydesdale.
@statedeptspox @OSCE Now, let’s get this straight.... The US fought Germany in WW2, they didn’t fight alongside Germany. Now I understand this is a difficult concept for some, but I think it’s important you understand this, if you’re going to the UN.
@RawStory @Teddy_Stache Because the multitude of previous investigations of HRC have yielded produced so much!!!
@CNBC @CNBCMakeIt I better pay off my $1500 then!
@MollyJongFast Central casting didn’t have any that fit?
@CharlesPPierce Do these books come with crayon colours of the Russian flag again?
@lazytraveldays @Peter_Fitz If he’s made a public statement, then it’s out there for debate.
@JulaineNickels @Brasilmagic He’s full of shit, so that probably is the same thing.
@SRuhle @realDonaldTrump Doh!
@lessspin @MarieCo92176893 @SkyNewsAust @rowandean As soon as she leaves the space she is renting free of charge in your head.
@TuckerCarlson Trump seems to think that the concerns of Russia and Saudi Arabia outweigh any of the democratic expectations of Americans.
@SkyNewsAust @StevenCiobo @TurnbullMalcolm He hopes that’s what voters think. It may not be the case.

@JohnJohnsonson @rohan_connolly Or his mistress.
@joshtpm The 2 maniacs actually increased the momentum.
@gelles @CNN And yet Trump still got in!!!
@MollyJongFast ‘She’ looks more from the nation of Silicone than anywhere else.
@JacobAWohl @Cernovich You should just stick to trying to get your ‘accusers’ to turn up. And getting your idiot mate to do his fly up in front of an audience.
@Cernovich Soros’ name is mentioned many times more than the occasional mention of Adelson. And I haven’t heard anyone threatening Adelson, but Soros got a bomb mailed to him last week because his name is mentioned often.
@EdKrassen They got Halloween and April fools mixed up.
@Tim_Andercust @JacobAWohl She was inspirational.... or was it invisible?
@SirajAHashmi Mozart lives!!!
@BridgetPhetasy There’s a difference between listening to and looking at.
@wvjoe911 @smilon713 Do they actually listen to themselves?
@WalshFreedom Returned in Bush presidency. Not a Democrat.

@Karoli More ‘big deal’ than ‘a big deal’.

@Russian_Starr @DrJasonJohnson It’s disgusting.
@rohan_connolly @Cobra1A Hawke got away with it because even though he was an intellect, he was as rough as guts. Keating never tried it, Rotten Johnny was nerdishly acceptable at it. Gillard never tried, Abbott .... who knows what he was? Rudd, Turnbull, Morrison.... embarrassing
@jimsciutto @Saintsfan5348 He wants a national pulpit to spread his hate from.
@JacobAWohl Where’s the woman accuser?
@JacobAWohl Where’s the woman?
@TrueFactsStated The mystery woman isn’t showing up apparently
@MikeCarlton01 @Cobra1A It’s all showbiz now for the Libs. What is their actual legislative agenda now anyway? Survival and keeping the ALP out?
@WSJ Appealing to the converted isn’t exactly winning the moderates over. He is a liability.
@skantrow @marthasjones_ My take on that ruling is that the parents were still authorised residents. The question of illegality wasn’t raised or addressed in that ruling.
@BillBurtis1 @NewDay @JohnBerman He loves himself and $. And he has set an example to your kids that lying at any price is acceptable. Explain that to them, not me. And then there is the debt.......
@BillBurtis1 @NewDay @JohnBerman No, conservative. But I can’t abide this moron’s escalating fraud. He is a disgrace.
@BillBurtis1 @NewDay @JohnBerman Nonsense. He doesn’t actually have to answer in that case. Stop making excuses for a self admitted liar.
@Tom66Ryan @barriecassidy Stable? 1 seat majority and a right wing that’s been agitating for 5 years, not to mention the mad monk sitting quietly on the backbench as he promised!!! Stable?
@MattOrtega He’s lucky that any charges can be tested in a court of law. That’s how it works Jnr.
@Stop_Trump20 She has nagging doubts.
@rickydbryan @GuistiKing @rohan_connolly I don’t get to look at other people’s licences, so I’ll just be concerned with what mine says.
@j_ogodfather @TomiLahren Why should celebrities stay away from politics. They pay more taxes than most which should afford them at least an equal say as you and I have. If you don’t like the message, you can tune out or respond.
@grantbosse @RadioFreeTom @MaxBoot This lot of republican both houses have outdone anything the Dems have ever done in failing to govern. This is the benchmark of abysmal abrogation of constitutional responsibility.
@farrm51 @newscomauHQ The bloke is all store front, no stock.
@TurnbullMalcolm @PatsKarvelas It’s almost like you need the ABC to set the record straight!!!
@TheRickWilson He knows words, he has the best words.
@WalshFreedom He doesn’t want the wall built, he wants the angst from the deplorons from not having it built.
@Brasilmagic It’s the fleeting relationship he has with his spine occasionally.
@realDonaldTrump No you won’t. You’re trying to sucker them in to vote GOP and then you’re going to drop the hammer and do everything you can to dismantle their medical benefits. You’ve got history on this with your statements.
@jonathanvswan @woodruffbets Everyone is so intent on looking for hidden agendas in everything these days.
@QuancyClayborne An attention seeker.
@jedshug @washingtonpost So it’s business as usual for the evil empire.
@TheRickWilson @JacobAWohl Does Wohl end up in juvenile detention at the end of all this?
@Curt941 @TheRickWilson @wohl_mom @JacobAWohl I want to make a joke about his mum being the girl you call.......
@TrueFactsStated He needs to give Chachi a clip behind the ear.
@M5B1tch @williamlegate @bstnboy @jedshug @Jack_Burkman @JacobAWohl @jentaub @maddow I love it when the crew burst out laughing.
@smh @Cobra1A It’s not hard to imagine the Beetrooter thinking he can do this sort of stuff.
@Jack_Burkman Is this the sequel to Dumb and Dumber To?
@SRuhle Crikey!
@LeanneRayner72 @ABCTV @JulieBishopMP She stopped giving (insert name) her full support.
@Mike05868190 @Morning_Joe @USCDornsife @latimes This pollster cited here picked Trump’s win.
@Morning_Joe @USCDornsife @latimes Still too close
@7NewsMelbourne @Cobra1A Ridiculous. Deserved a custodial sentence.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Does it come in pictorial format?
@JacobAWohl You couldn’t find another phone number other than your mother’s?
@PiperK @Teddy_Stache @ScottMStedman @JacobWohl Not exactly Mata Hari
@yashar @JacobAWohl Jacob whopper
@JacobAWohl Jury duty!!! Lol.... oh dear!!! This is the best laugh ever.
@oneunderscore__ @maddow Lol. He was on jury duty!!! Lol..... oh dear..... where is this fool Wohl?
@williamlegate Maddow on it right now.
@davidmweissman Sexually assaulting himself....a lot
@AngrierWHStaff Someone is sitting in an office somewhere, wondering how this genius operation went bad!!!
@wvjoe911 Yep, this is how these things work.
@BuzzFeedNews If he shut his mouth more and opened his ears some, he may have figured this out a lot earlier.
@chrislhayes It was Machiavellian without skill and thought.
@EdKrassen And they would have gotten away with it, if it wasn’t for those darned kids!!!!
@oneunderscore__ @Kris_Sacrebleu Surefire’s subsidiary: ‘Shitshow’ has now taken over operation Titanic
@AricToler This is the funniest thing I’ve read all year
@rickhasen That he’s an amateur.
@Jack_Burkman @JacobAWohl Have the FBI been in contact yet?
@JacobAWohl This is the funniest thing I’ve read this year. Someone is going to be in trouble ........ and it’s not going to be Mueller.
@IWiIlkaga Hows this working out for you now? Referred to the FBI. Fucking idiots who thought this up. Lol
@Wayes22 @KevinDBishop @BenjySarlin @LindseyGrahamSC He won’t want to go there because he knows where this is leading. And that scares people like him. Because even they know they can’t trust Trump with their precious 2nd A.
@BLitt1978 @jaketapper Christian Slater as Lieutenant Commader Jack Reece.
@nypost More ; than :
@BillKristol @PrincessBravato They could resign on principle. That’d send a message.
@CathCastner @Noahpinion Trump himself as a US citizen would most probably afford them citizenship status.
@KFILE It’s not like someone from this administration to rewrite history!
@carolynedgar Even if he doesn’t maintain the house, he will use it as red meat all the way through to 2020. He doesn’t actually want any change, just as he doesn’t want the wall built or HRC locked up, he just wants the outrage of it not getting done and being obstructed. That’s what he wants
@tripgabriel Good pick up.
@jakebebber @PMCroninCNAS And Trump.
@AJDelgado13 It might be a valid subject to look at, but his timing is pretty obvious.
@ChrisKaias Carlton spent it all in those first 3 qtrs of the season.
@deemadigan Matt Chubb Melbourne. But the waiting list is long.
@mr_majestyk @scotclose @mattyglesias It was abolished in Aug 1986. For a child to become a citizen in Australia, they have to be born to at least one parent who is a citizen or permanent resident status.
@jonathanvswan Can we vaccinate against the likes of her?
@nikkihaley Oh dear!!!  You got this one wrong. There’s no such thing as rewind on Twitter either!!
@ScottMStedman So the bloke who headed up the FBI for 12 years, was in the public eye all that time, now has someone wanting to come forward and accuse him of sexual improprieties. Whoever dreamed this one up is going to end up the punchline in a lot of comedy routines.
@IWiIlkaga This is how original you lot are. You could hear your vacuous heads turning over cogs to come up with this bullshit. And it took you 2 months to find some Stepford wife to agree to it. What other nonsense are you going to come up with? Maybe try ‘he was a Russian spy’
@IWiIlkaga Just because you need to assault someone to get a root, doesn’t mean others do. How much is she getting paid to lie?
@IWiIlkaga All those guilty pleas....... they must all get retracted then I guess!! Fucking amateurs.
@ScottMStedman Mueller’s evidence is still evidence, that gets to be tested and verified. Discrediting him doesn’t all of a sudden make what facts he has unearthed, any less factual.
@JacobAWohl Sean Hannity is not a source. He’s a cancer.
@MalcolmNance Oafkeepers
@SENAfternoons We were both wrong. 6 tests would take it to the 4th test against India in January. Having served 3 already.
@getongab Freedom doesn’t exclude consequence and the consequences of allowing hate speech to go unfettered has a particular set of consequences. Tidy up your house.
@wvjoe911 @tymanmayo He can’t. The affiliate stations hold seperate licences and by the time he fought the whole lot of them in court, he’d be long in the ground.
@SENAfternoons You don’t think they have gotten the message? When does CA get penalised for the disrepute they’ve imposed on the game in this country by being shambolic and unaccountable?
@SENAfternoons I think they got the messsge. And it was still a 1 match ban at the time, IF the ICC saw fit to follow through and suspend. 6 matches would still see them playing this year.
@SENAfternoons They’ve already done 7 months for what is essentially a 1 match suspension (unless you’re DuPlessis)
@SarahBurris @joanwalsh So we are going to be bombarded with this anti religious bullshit now. The Dickhead in the White House is about as religious as Pol Pot and Mao. They’ll grasp at anything and hope it’s got enough traction for the morons to run with it.
@The_UnSilent_ The Christmas party must be a doozy when he enters the room.
@realDonaldTrFan This was one of those double takes, check the twitter handle moments!!!
@prisonculture Any country that can turn the likes of Honey boo into a celebrity, has the capacity to sustain a lot of low aspirational, unthinking types.
@netanyahu @AinsleyBBrown Your friend Trump dog whistles about globalists, feeding the hatred towards Jewish people. You should be condemning him........ but you won’t and we know why. $$$$$
@lancegregmason @realDonaldTrump Is he going to manufacture a scenario where the troops fire on the caravan?
@Like2Plan @TheRickWilson @Morning_Joe @MSNBC @BreitbartNews Like fraud, lying, treason, bankruptcies, sexual assault, paying off prom stars, running a false charity?
@juliaioffe I’d say the claim is immeasurable, maybe hyperbolic, but not necessarily untrue.
@Brasilmagic Does the law afford that right? I thought the 5th only applies to self incrimination.
@Brasilmagic How can he plead the 5th when it’s not incriminating himself?
@EdwardTHardy @Goss30Goss His ongoing war with truth and reality!
@Robillard Isn’t that the case with every election ever ?
@TheRickWilson They’ll have to compete with Trump’s syphilis induced madness!
@ryanjreilly @Robillard Cited, not cured...... When is Twitter going to give us an edit function?
@mindyanns @nypost Hate got her eventually, after surviving it decades earlier. She deserved far far better than this.
@ryanjreilly @Robillard No different to the man who groped the  woman on the plane and then cured Trump’s words. This is going to be something more common in prosecutions.
@Sirveaux1066 @davidmweissman I’ve had this discussion before. Some gun nuts even saying they’d be comfortable with citizens owning and storing nuclear devices in their neighbourhood. The lunacy is beyond comprehension.
@RawStory @CandaceTX Trump would blame MSNBC but it’s too many letters for him to not screw up.
@ndrew_lawrence @Popehat GOPers now only like to invoke the parts of the bible that suit them. They forget that Jesus wanted to heal the sick, not turn them away.
@JordanUhl I’m surprised this administration hasn’t written its own version of the bible.
@thehill If only he had picked up after his cat!
@CandaceTX I read she got turfed out of her apartment complex too.
@AndrewGillum @realDonaldTrump The only thing that makes him really listen is defeat. And you’re going to stop him on his tracks and listen loud and hard.
@thehill He’s going to steal Florida right from under DeSantis’ nose!!!
@SafetyPinDaily @chrisfayers The story just gets drowned in Trump’s never ending cycle of scandal.
@KellyannePolls If your boss keeps spitting out his poison, there will be more of this.
@thehill I bet Trump hopes she runs. Time for her to stand back because she’ll alienate more than she will attract. The Dems have to get the next candidate spot on correct or he will win again.
@3AW693 They found my other half?
@TonyHWindsor A tax cut for big business?
@210Deek @BuzzFeedNews The “default “ mechanism
@newscomauHQ Not quite as inane as the Meagan nonsense over how she looked with her hair tied back, but it’s close. Or maybe it is!! Has some hair stylist taken over News Ltd?
@Travis_Waldron @shaunking When is the next coup taking place?
@AuschwitzMuseum @MichelleMayber8 Are people still pushing that Gröning garbage? Soros was barely into his teens when the war ended.
@Dangchick1 @realDonaldTrump He will use some sort of word salad to give succour to those he’s pretending to denounce.
@getongab Where will the nazis and Klan congregate now?
@TedBrow35007244 @thehill Let’s hear him say it, unreservedly, without his word salad worming his way out to give an olive branch to those  who search his words for succour.
@MollyJongFast She could get away with being related to him.
@alan_finlayson @MCYeeehaaa @winx_horse @AtTheRaces @TheValley @CoxPlate Why don’t you bring your best here?
@MollyJongFast She’s the only one with balls.
@thehill He didn’t need to dress up
@jeremynewberger I thought he was the effluent in the room.
@rdhirsh @thehill I’m talking about Brazil specifically. No leader lasts there without being turfed out unceremoniously.
@thehill He won’t last, they never do.
@WSJ How soon before buyers remorse?
@JohnCornyn Protesting is not a mob scene. The 1st A says so.
@B52Malmet The news cycle these days doesn’t allow to apply sustained public pressure any more on these types.
@PressSec @marc_lotter @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Depends if he has mentioned Soros recently and chanted ‘lock him up’ along with a crowd!
@thehill He’s going to bear the consequences of losing the house.
@DanielJRoth1 @AoDespair Consider this for a minute: Trump doesn’t want the wall built, HRC locked up, the media to stop reporting on him..... he wants the angst out there. He needs the outrage to fuel his base. The minute all that rage goes, so does his electability.
@DanielJRoth1 @AoDespair You blame whoever you choose. And others can blame whoever they choose. Just as Trump blames everyone else.
@TonySheahan Seems a pretty mild sledge to me. A quick ‘eff off, aren’t you supposed to be riding in the 5th at Randwick?’ would have done the trick.
@RealCandaceO 0%??
@MSNBC He has an empty vessel for a brain that makes more noise than the biggest microphone.
@Amygirl55 @MPMPHD1 @penningtonkm He pays millions in taxes, he can have a voice in politics.
@TheEconomist That’s the narrative the house of Saud want their citizens to believe. Too bad the crew sent to carry out the crime were close to MbS.
@BillKristol They’re in the home straight of hate. Nov 6 is their finishing line before they move onto other insidious agendas.
@petryan @RohanCT He looked good too.......
@tariqnasheed She will now be seen congregating in car parks all over the city as she has no job and nowhere to live.
@JDiamond1 I’m waiting for him to say that he prefers armed police who don’t get shot.
@AnnLHamilton @SpectrumEntUS Apparently she has been fired
@willsommer @dandrezner I get the feeling Ryan can’t wait to abandon a ship he lost control of when Trump won the nomination. He’s barely fired a whimper in protest and more often than not has been happy to be invisible.
@MSNBC Too complicated for him to fold up.
@CBSNews It’s a bit late now. Maybe they should have done that prior to the shooting when he was on social media ....... you know...... spreading hate.
@IvankaTrump It’s apparently their fault according to your father.
@tlalawethika @gilesblue0 @thedailybeast That existed before Christianity in many communities.
@realDonaldTrump They’re just warming up.
@oliverdarcy Talent, or self absorbed image?
@tlalawethika @gilesblue0 @thedailybeast And some of the “10 commandments” already existed in cultural impositions on societies before they were introduced. Common sense guidelines weren’t the sole domain of Christian judeo dogma.
@tlalawethika @gilesblue0 @thedailybeast Many millions of murdered people, people who fucked out of marriage, people who stole, fought in wars, didn’t go to church etc etc might disagree and say it might have been the foundation of your western world, but not theirs.
@tlalawethika @gilesblue0 @thedailybeast You would argue that because this code was handed down, it was therefore the basis. I would argue that just because some sector of society tried to impose it, it wasn’t necessarily adhered to and quite often disregarded and therefore was not the foundation.
@tlalawethika @gilesblue0 @thedailybeast Some would argue that Hitler’s ideology closely resembles a lot of what is in the bible, even to this day and in particular parts of America vehemently would argue this. This includes race, hate, misogyny and even sexual promiscuity.
@tlalawethika @gilesblue0 @thedailybeast Morality is a personal benchmark. You might think you have to obey your parents as the commandments say, but if they’re cunts and you know it, it’s not a moral stance to abide by.
@tlalawethika @gilesblue0 @thedailybeast If you choose to adhere to it. There was a lot more to western societies development than just imposed religion. There was environmental, geography, cultural, war, race, literature, education which ALL played varying roles in the formulation of Europe. Sexual promiscuity existed
@tlalawethika @gilesblue0 @thedailybeast Show me the text that says you can’t have gangie when Lot fucks his 2 daughters.
@tlalawethika @gilesblue0 @thedailybeast But you can’t isloate one little text when the whole tome purports to be the teachings and lessons of we all are supposed to adhere to. Charity isn’t in the 10 commandments but is a western practice. Are you excluding charity as a western value?
@tlalawethika @gilesblue0 @thedailybeast So the tome that contains your 10 commandments is hypocritical and contradicts itself continuously? So it’s not really a moral code, it’s a free for all for whatever you want to do. Thank you. You’ve proven my point.
@tlalawethika @gilesblue0 @thedailybeast Or 2 Kings 2 22-25 where 40 kids hang shit on some bald shelia and god sends down two bears to kill the little mongrels. Is this part of the “thou shalt not kill” moral code you’re talking about?
@tlalawethika @gilesblue0 @thedailybeast Maybe it’s Onan rooting his dead brother’s missus and God is posses off because he blew on her guts rather than inside her motor. Is THIS the moral code you’re talking about?
@tlalawethika @gilesblue0 @thedailybeast I don’t see it mentioned anywhere in your moral codes. But in the bible Lots 2 daughters fuck their dad. Is this the moral code you talk about perhaps?
@tlalawethika @gilesblue0 @thedailybeast I’m not going to open them. Put them in your own words or don’t bother posting. Don’t be lazy. Have some of your own ideas other than others.
@tlalawethika @gilesblue0 @thedailybeast Are you actually citing wiki as a definitive and last source? And I’m still waiting to see your doctrine citing the compulsion of everyone to follow these codes today. Or are you avoiding biblical references?
@tlalawethika @gilesblue0 @thedailybeast Western culture may imply..... one was biblical. Two other describe cultural influences. There is no definitive explanation that it was entirely biblical.  Do yourself a favour and read what you quote.
@tlalawethika @gilesblue0 @thedailybeast Paganism and other ideologies existed in many Northern European areas well before the spread of Christianity.
@tlalawethika @gilesblue0 @thedailybeast So there is no founding on this code. Nothing was founded on this code, they were imposed by some on others. That’s not founding anything. Do you think the bible gives this ‘code’ validity?
@tlalawethika @gilesblue0 @thedailybeast I can’t be blasphemous to any deity?
@tlalawethika @gilesblue0 @thedailybeast Is it compulsory to be respectful to your elders?
@tlalawethika @gilesblue0 @thedailybeast Covet
@tlalawethika @gilesblue0 @thedailybeast Is it really? So though shalt not cover thy neighbours wife..... so no one can fuck someone else’s partner? Is that what your saying exists?
@tlalawethika @gilesblue0 @thedailybeast BTW, they were script from the Middle East. Not western in any contexts other than west of the east.
@tlalawethika @gilesblue0 @thedailybeast The Ten Commandments aren’t written statute. I don’t take any stock on that. Now provide me with western moral codes that have some compulsion for everyone to abide by.
@tlalawethika @gilesblue0 @thedailybeast Where are these general western moral codes written down? Please provide them for us all.
@tlalawethika @gilesblue0 @thedailybeast Where is written that sex belongs in the spectrum of morality? And where is it written that your idea of morality has to be everyone else’s? If you’re not breaking a law, then why apply a further morality test to it? In other words, look after your own actions.
@chelseahandler Not Candace Owens!
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Please quote Sanders’ call to violence.
@sahluwal @AllResistNews The tears come when the consequences loom.
@LindaPapps There are only 2 flights a day that are direct and the others are stop overs. So your 1.5 (2:20 +) hours seems very generous not taking into account waiting times for the 2 hour flights. Some take 9 hours with connections. Get the drift?
@LindaPapps And Adelaide to GC is 2:20 hours
@LindaPapps And Adelaide is in Adelaide in case you don’t realise!
@LindaPapps You do realise Betts asked to be allowed to stay with his pregnant wife and should have been allowed to. I understand you’re butt hurt because your club is insensitive to players needs as evidenced by the annual requests to get out.
@9NewsAUS Maybe he might offer to pay his legal bills like he did when he said people should rough up protesters at his rallies.
@RealCandaceO Does the O at the end of your twitter handle represent 0%?
@cartoonz @jaketapper @benshapiro Did you want them to work?
@KurtSchlichter Okie dokey! What else?
@DeplorableChoir Moron
@TrueFactsStated Looks like an offside flag
@TeaPainUSA He likes his soccer.
@Kris_Sacrebleu Could see that one happening unfortunately.
@mray71150 @TheRickWilson Stop thinking about penis.
@maggieNYT @yashar He’s a false president.
@Redpainter1 Unrequited contempt
@JKawate @TrueFactsStated I don’t enough about stroke to answer. But I’ve heard that film clip a few times from the other night and the first few words from 2 sentences were indecipherable to me. So it’s either my hearing or his speech.
@DebraTweets @TrueFactsStated Yep
@TrueFactsStated He was slurring his words in Wisconsin the other night at the start of sentences.
@RadioFreeTom The whole world knows his ablutions schedule.
@gramyunfiltered @thehill The 34-37yo?
@thehill His mouth trapped himself.
@washingtonpost Lol.... it’s getting to him.
@ReutersPolitics It’s the most efficient way of getting instructions.
@kathygriffin Someone get that idiot a stronger laxative!
@AynRandPaulRyan His prunes haven’t taken effect yet.
@DailyMirror Send him a photo
@the_ryan_boyle @InsightTaxLaw @WalshFreedom You seem very keen on all things Russian. I get the feeling you’ve spent a lot of time there, maybe in a bot factory. Very Trumpian of you.
@CBSEveningNews Trump: “errrrr ummmm Hilary’s emails!!!”
@BabaVaTee @CNN Did you know god created evil? Why would anyone want evil? Isiah 45:7
@the_ryan_boyle @WalshFreedom Syntax is important. Learn to use it properly.
@BabaVaTee @CNN Really, so god sent down 2 bears to kill 40 kids who were teasingba bald lady? And that’s a good thing?
@BabaVaTee @CNN Do you believe EVERYTHING you read in the bible?
@WingYour @BrianTorri @RResisto @TheRickWilson That’s codswallop
@thehill Will he offer to pay the legal costs of the bomber? Seems to be his thing.
@atrupar @RepChrisStewart So maybe it’s alright that any and everyone can be blown up? What’s he trying to say? Does he know what he’s trying to say? Does anyone know what he’s trying to say?
@jessicaschulb @swin24 Bingo
@jemelehill @barbs73 No one is worth $23 mill a year, not when people are working hard jobs for as little as $7 an hour and barely surviving. It’s obscene
@ChrisCuomo @PrincessBravato But the deplorons don’t know it’s a lie.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump He’s the president, instead of one minute asking for unity, then the next day blaming the media for having bombs sent to themselves, maybe he just stick to the message of unity.
@MSNBC Of course he does.
@suzziees3 @WalshFreedom But when he has 96 plus months of continuous economic growth as Obama did after the GFC and had 4 better qtrs of growth than Trump’s best qtr, get back to me.
@suzziees3 @WalshFreedom Jobs rate have slowed since 2016, real wages are stagnant, the border crossings have increased after a decade mown in 2015/16, and now he’s realised his tax cuts have missed the mark and needs to give one to middle class, inflation increased, govt debt 47% increase under Trump
@suzziees3 @WalshFreedom Why would he even lie about things that have photographic evidence to disprove it? But he does it anyway!!! There’s no reason for his endless cavalcade of lies. He doesn’t talk about hope, he talks about beating someone.
@suzziees3 @WalshFreedom He just lies...... he doesn’t even have alleged sources anymore.... he plucks something out of his vacuous head and says it, because he knows the poorly educated lap it up. They feed on it. He is their ‘succubus’
@suzziees3 @WalshFreedom In comparison, Satan is more honest than Trump.
@HashtagGriswold And change the climate
@abbeludwig @kenspack Meth is bad!!
@BenLin2015 @realDonaldTrump @getongab @TheRickWilson @CNN I take it you only qualified on one of those!!
@MsLeahCatherine @thedailybeast Not sure her and the orange blanc mange see eye to eye. I did read that Lachlan Murdoch has been speaking about her situation at NBC of late.
@thehill She’s right.... HE couldn’t be more presidential. Many others could, but not him.
@davidmweissman @CandaceTX They need to externalise blame. Heaven forbid they were responsible for anything that went wrong in their lives.... it has to be someone else’s fault.
@suzziees3 @WalshFreedom Trump just lies..... and lies when he doesn’t even need to. And rather than correct his lies, which is an admission of losing in his eyes, he deflects. That’s the stuff of a 5yo.
@suzziees3 @WalshFreedom Switch off Fox, you’ll get less lies. But if you expect everyone be 100% spot on, you’ll be watching a blank screen every night as newsrooms try and prove things wrong. Sometimes they go with what they believe to be right and correct when they find it isn’t.
@RadioFreeTom Lol...... if the plane crashes, I’ll be hanging onto that bloke.
@the_ryan_boyle @WalshFreedom I never said it was right, I said it was a pleasure.
@HarleyRouda @SoCallls Rohrabacher says “nyet nyet nyet”
@the_ryan_boyle @WalshFreedom Hurting your sensitivities is probably more a pleasure than a job. You should move to the Antarctic if your snowflakes are going to melt so easily.
@WalshFreedom Trump should stop saying the media is the enemy of the people and a lot of the accusations would have a lot less traction.
@SkyNewsAust @M_McCormackMP I thought that was what parliament was for!
@Popehat @TheRickWilson Is that a 2 slice toaster or a 4 slice toaster?
@jackietrad @deemadigan @Barnaby_Joyce That doesn’t fit in with his ideas of ‘family values ‘
@DearAuntCrabby @DesignationSix Can we do that?
@CHawksRun @thelaurakoski @Nitemists @tonyschwartz The executive branch can’t cancel any election. All elections are run by the states and their particular voting regulations and outcomes. Trump would have to coordinate with them all. Not sure how that would play out.
@AGDrew62 @1116sen Pies getting points up for Quaynor and Kelly.
@TuckerCarlson By people like yourself promoting birthers and supporting people like McConnell when they said they’d obstruct Obama every inch of the way. That’s how.
@AFL_House Collingwood getting their points up.
@LindaPapps What’s more important? A team building exercise that was turned to shit, or the welfare of a woman who was having twins and forcing her partner to become unavailable for a period when it wasn’t necessary?
@LindaPapps To twins. Forcing a player to leave his wife 6 months pregnant with twins when they could have easily let him stay close to her. What team building do they think they can impart on a 14 year veteran?
@RealSaavedra So ramping it up to sending bombs is an appropriate response?
@newscomauHQ Clubhouse leader for the most inane comment by a national newspaper.
@realDonaldTrump Lock Trump up!!!
@ScottMStedman Georgie’s mum?
@MaryRWilliams4 @maydaymindy9 @CandaceTX @maddow @MSNBC @JoeNBC At least yachts provide jobs for boatbuilders. Whether their prices are overinflated is another issue.
@CheriJacobus How could she be worth $23mill a year? That’s $450K a week! No one is worth that money for just blabbering on TV or throwing a football for that matter.
@MaryRWilliams4 @maydaymindy9 @CandaceTX @maddow @MSNBC @JoeNBC I just think there is an obscene amount spent on non essential and frivolous things. And these things produce little other than entertainment and feeding a very limited circle of beneficiaries. It’s just a redistribution of income.
@MaryRWilliams4 @maydaymindy9 @CandaceTX @maddow @MSNBC @JoeNBC You could decrease a footballer’s salary 10 times and increase a teachers 10% and the footballer would still be earning many multiples of the teacher. A footballer would still live a very good life on $500K to $2 million.
@MaryRWilliams4 @maydaymindy9 @CandaceTX @maddow @MSNBC @JoeNBC Who is of more value to society? A teacher or a footballer?
@AM_McCarthy @CheriJacobus Fox might not be a good fit for her now either, given her history with Trump. You’re better off having them all in the one place than spread over the media landscape I reckon.
@AM_McCarthy @CheriJacobus Fox aren’t really competition for NBC. In fact, I’d be encouraging her to return to her cave, it makes their decision to be rid of her look even better.
@9NewsAUS @ScottMorrisonMP He’s just changed the location of dying.
@jdawsey1 On their unsecured iPhones
@MaryRWilliams4 @maydaymindy9 @CandaceTX @maddow @MSNBC @JoeNBC I agree workers should pay more. But companies should also be allowed to remain profitable. But whilst we bemoan low wages for these workers, do we bemoan the affordable food they sell? And it’s still skewed badly that a footballer produces nothing and earns millions.
@JoeNBC I’d say a lot of registered Republicans are voting early and voting Democrat in a display of protest and defiance.
@amhidden @NicolleDWallace @shoemakermike @LateNightSeth @steveschmidt I laugh out of sheer exasperation and the futility of a situation.
@MaryRWilliams4 @maydaymindy9 @CandaceTX @maddow @MSNBC @JoeNBC I struggle with the concept someone is worth $8 mill, let alone $23mill. Especially when people are working equally hard for sometimes $7 an hour in places. Our priorities are way out of whack.
@grantstern @MichaelAvenatti I wonder if Kavanaugh will rule to exclude sitting Justices from facing disclosure?
@skeet_barlow @bayonetbrant @TheRickWilson What’s the weather like in Leningrad today?
@MaryRWilliams4 @maydaymindy9 @CandaceTX @maddow @MSNBC @JoeNBC And then you have Megyn Kelly on $23mill!!, more than Scarborough And Maddow combined!!! If they want to give no talents hacks money like that, I’m applying.
@LindaPapps @kazza_1961 @3AWisfootball 5 times, like every Vic club that choose to play all their home games in Vic. And players have chosen not to travel if their partners are close to birth. So any other nonsense from you?
@DaShanneStokes @realDonaldTrump And he was slurring the start of his sentences in Wisconsin.
RT @tedlieu: Watching this made me smile. You will too. https://t.co/LsrPovHEMP
@KaivanShroff @LouDobbs And then he deleted. He’s a coward.
@DuncanWeldon @Birdyword I haven’t ironed a shirt in years.  But my work isn’t a fashion contest. As long as it’s a clean shirt every day that’s all that matters. It’s usually taken off with an hour or two anyway.
@spettypi @JenniferJJacobs Not a fan of Sanders, but I didn’t ever hear him telling people to rough others up, or he likes people who bodyslam others, or calling the media the enemy of the people.
@jimsciutto @PressSec He couldn’t.... many others could have.
@9NewsAUS Ah look, we have a queue of nongs checking in ❌
@BobRae48 @MuskokaMoneybag Imagine being the poor bugger who has to try and interpret his gibberish. They’ll be questioning every rule of English they thought they knew.
@CNBC No getting past this bloke!
@kazza_1961 @3AWisfootball You don’t make a bloke go and leave his wife, go INTERSTATE, when his wife is close to birth. And if you’re so stupid to do that, you allow him his phone 24/7. Could they be anymore insensitive to his situation?
@clarencehilljr Checkmate
@SkyNewsAust @Barnaby_Joyce Cough cubbie station cough
@Shorten_Suite @KKeneally That will stave off a challenge by the beetrooter.
@EvelDeplorable @Chomskyter @washingtonpost I pay 27% tax. I pay &lt;2% of total income in a Medicare levy and get universal health care. What do you pay?
@rohan_connolly Morrison is proof there is no god.
@3AWisfootball Broke no rules except for standards of common decency. Not allowing a bloke to have his mobile with him whilst his partner is about to give birth..... they shouldn’t have made him go on the trip in the first place.
@APWestRegion @AP Even at 14, you know killing someone is wrong.
@NYinLA2121 I don’t think the full impact of what the potential consequences could have been has hit home to many yet.
@SkyNewsAust @fraser_anning @RealBobKatter Did he mention that every 6 months, someone gets eaten by a crocodile in his electorate?
@thedailybeast Send him a false flag then. See how false he thinks it is then.
@MaryRWilliams4 @maydaymindy9 @CandaceTX @maddow @MSNBC @JoeNBC It’s like going for a walk, you get to see a lot of things on the way you never knew existed. And I particularly like how she doesn’t tell you what she thinks 99% of the time, she just presents the info and then stares at you.... and then when the crew laugh . Great show.
@MaryRWilliams4 @maydaymindy9 @CandaceTX @maddow @MSNBC @JoeNBC Ruhle is the opposite. She takes 10 seconds to take your knees out from under you. She’s brutally efficient.
@MaryRWilliams4 @maydaymindy9 @CandaceTX @maddow @MSNBC @JoeNBC They’re all performers. They have to have an appealing delivery style and especially Maddow. When you take 20-25 minutes at times to build the narrative before you get to the point..... that’s a performance.
@MaryRWilliams4 @maydaymindy9 @CandaceTX @maddow @MSNBC @JoeNBC He was doing ok up until 2-3 months ago. Even his verbose tirades railing against Trump were interesting.......then something changed..... whilst still critical of Trump, he became more of a cheerleader for the conservatives again. Something changed and I reckon it was Kavanaugh
@brianstelter @AllResistNews @megynkelly I don’t understand why NBC wanted her specifically and why she thought she would be a good fit for them. She had already alienated the Trumpers by the time she got to NBC so they weeent going to follow her across and she definitely didn’t have the more liberal viewers on board.
@MaryRWilliams4 @maydaymindy9 @CandaceTX @maddow @MSNBC @JoeNBC If I was running the joint, she’d be highest paid, I’d bump Wallace into Matthew’s spot, and have Wallace, Ruhle, O’Donnell and Melber as next tier on the pay level. Followed by Hayes. They’re the best performers .
@MaryRWilliams4 @maydaymindy9 @CandaceTX @maddow @MSNBC @JoeNBC I’m not arguing she’s a better performer, I’m hypothesising why there would be a pay difference. Maybe it’s a male/ female thing, maybe it’s a revenue thing, maybe she had a hopeless agent.......
@MaryRWilliams4 @maydaymindy9 @CandaceTX @maddow @MSNBC @JoeNBC I’d be more interested in seeing what the pay difference is between him and Mika. I prefer to listen to her than him even though I can’t determine if she’s a right leaning left winger or a left leaning right winger.
@MaryRWilliams4 @maydaymindy9 @CandaceTX @maddow @MSNBC @JoeNBC Once again, he works 2 plus hours on air. And from my understanding of these contracts, a lot of them depend on advertising $ earnt in the particular timeslots. So some of the discrepancy could boil down to whose slot is the bigger $ earner as opposed to the ratings.
@MaryRWilliams4 @maydaymindy9 @CandaceTX @maddow @MSNBC @JoeNBC Ah yes, but I gave my opinion as to why there could be a discrepancy, as per the hours worked and I didn’t mention the early hours either. But you didn’t agree. I can only offer an opinion. Neither of us are privy to why there is a discrepancy or if she’s unhappy about it.
@MaryRWilliams4 @maydaymindy9 @CandaceTX @maddow @MSNBC @JoeNBC At $8-10 million, I’m not overly inclined to fight for any injustices. If it was $80-100K, bloody oath I would. And I think she’s the best thing on MSNBC, but there are other struggles in this world that are more important than her $2 million pay gap.
@MaryRWilliams4 @maydaymindy9 @CandaceTX @maddow @MSNBC @JoeNBC You should be thankful then.
@MaryRWilliams4 @maydaymindy9 @CandaceTX @maddow @MSNBC @JoeNBC Have you heard him ever shut up to give anyone else a chance to talk?
@maydaymindy9 @CandaceTX @maddow @MSNBC @JoeNBC In fairness, he does 2 plus hours a day.
@MaryWynne3 @Lovemypupper @GitRDoneLarry @SleepySteve95 Trust me, you’ve got Dickhead written all over you. When you drive into town, a halo of stupidity precedes you for miles.
@MaryWynne3 @Lovemypupper @GitRDoneLarry @SleepySteve95 And your father for rooting his sister.
@MaryWynne3 @Lovemypupper @GitRDoneLarry @SleepySteve95 They’ll arrest you for fucking stupidity.
@MaryWynne3 @Lovemypupper @GitRDoneLarry @SleepySteve95 If CNN’s name is on the envelope, as it is to be able to be t to the mailroom, then they’ve been targeted. Do you think the bomb asks any non addressed people to leave the room whilst it explodes? Dickhead!!
@MaryWynne3 @GitRDoneLarry @SleepySteve95 If a bomb ends up in your mailroom, you’ve been targeted.
@kashanacauley Must have been wrongly addressed. Please send all white power over to Fox News.
@TAPAlerts He knew. He just didn’t want to acknowledge what the consequences of his words are. He definitely knew.
@fungeezer62 @thehill Bot
@Lovewhistle @WalshFreedom Aha.... there it is..... limbaugh and coulter are saying it’s a Dem plot. And now you’re trying to intimate the same. Where is your Q Anon ❌?
@Lovewhistle @WalshFreedom And yet some bloke grabs a woman’s breast on a plane and says the president says it’s ok. Each recipient of these names has been attached verbally by Trump. He’s created this situation. Your president.
@Lovewhistle @WalshFreedom You’ve never heard Trump telling people at his rallies to rough people up, he will pay their legal costs? You never heard Trump saying if your famous you can grab women on the pussy? You’ve never heard Trump call journos the enemy of the people? Never?
@MarcACaputo @MollyJongFast It’s just a saying. I wouldn’t condemn on that.
@Lovewhistle @WalshFreedom And I saw condemnation for Scalise shooting from all across the political spectrum. This isn’t a point scoring what about what about thing. Trump needs to issue a simple tweet telling EVERYONE this is not on. His son did..... he hasn’t. The president hasn’t....
@Lovewhistle @WalshFreedom So you think tit for tat is good? You think bombs = people harassing. Maybe you just think trying to justify violence is acceptable and normal. All violence is not acceptable. But I’m sure you feel happy now that your distorted ledger has been ‘balanced‘.
@WalshFreedom Trump could tweet condemnation at a moments notice. It doesn’t require a formulated statement, just a few words of condemnation........ but not Trump. It will most likely have to be extracted from him after a few days of expectation from the nation.
@realDonaldTrump A bit like those riots in California?
@MichaelGalanin @chrisfayers Tell them to keep the noise down.
@RadioFreeTom First prize is one evening with Bannon, second prize is 2 evenings with Bannon.
@thehill He’s concerned that their lies are detracting from his.
@AJEnglish Is the sanction for the murder or the pathetic cover up?
@DerekCressman @barbs73 Someone with the name Jesus maybe?
@thehill Hilary and Obama I’d say will get the blame.
@Ironmantra @RealCandaceO @Swamp_Fever2020 Bullshit. Anyone with an interest in electing a Dem house in 2 weeks will be doing their utmost to quell any talk of the border nonsense that Trump thrives on.
@thehill Repeal the last lot of tax cuts, implement a new round of cuts for middle and lower income earners. Of course we know Trump won’t do that.
@SkyNewsAust @PeterDutton_MP That doesn’t make sense. He says Labor wants them here and that’s supposed to equate with them being in detention?
@SkyNewsAust @KellyODwyer Are the Libs changing leaders this week?
@newscomauHQ Their business is their business.
@AP Not worried about the murder, just the poor attempt at the cover up!!!
RT @9NewsQueensland: EXCLUSIVE: Two boaties have had an incredible, up-close encounter with a whale shark while fishing off Stradbroke Isla…
@SRuhle @LaraLeaTrump It would be a massacre. They’d have to implement the mercy ruhle if you got hold of her.
@deemadigan Nothing wrong with saying it....... if you grew up saying it. For those who haven’t, it stands out like .........
@9NewsAUS From the Trump playbook..... just say anything and expect the poorly educated to believe it.
@9NewsAUS He seems more concerned about how badly the execution was carried out and the subsequent cover up was, than the fact that someone was murdered.
@willsommer @TheRickWilson And she was expecting a nazi to be ???
@CNN The sooner this spineless coward is gone, the better off everyone will be.
@the_miroverse @kylegriffin1 An alt right hook
@WalshFreedom He puts himself first.
@jaketapper @CNN It’s exactly what they want. Now they are unhindered in producing mid range nukes to threaten Western Europe. Watch what Trump does now with NATO. I bet he makes signals to walk away from it and probably will attempt to do so.
@Tennesseine Part of his self loathing ritual.
@ScottPatten76 If he drives down prices, what guarantees has he got that the operators don’t walk away as happened at Hazelwood (Kennett’s  and Stockdale’s fault for( not writing in a reacquisition clause when they sold it)
@Independent They’ll suck.
@LoveCommaZach California’s growth rate has slowed to 0.78% per annum. Still above the US growth rate of 0.7%.
@HayesBrown @VeraMBergen He will do it closer to the election for impact.
@wvjoe911 @Randy18888 They have to keep them “oot”
@BCAppelbaum @Pinboard @zeynep The K9P gang?
@CBSNews That’s consensual and probably doesn’t really need to be made public.
@9NewsAUS @Fi_Willan Or what? Close them down?
@chelseahandler Not only that, but an advertisement for the need for  regular eye checkups.
@9NewsAUS I prefer Hadi Gost or a chicken hariyali myself.
@EdwardTHardy Was there any question he wouldn’t?
@jdawsey1 @jaketapper They’re driving them straight to the polls.
@joncoopertweets @JoSantisteban @AndrewGillum Give the man a break!! His master had spurned him recently and when you lose your one true love, any mention of your devotion to him must be hard to hear.
@JoyAnnReid The programming is complete for Marco.
@CheriJacobus @CNNPolitics So........ he does one good thing..... OK, 2 good things, no one wants the nuclear football in the hands of a Chinese official either.
@MattDoran91 @PatsKarvelas They must be really dirty on Turnbull!  Maybe they are hoping he throws in a couple of million at the next election, like he did at the last. At least we know Malcolm wasn’t in it for the money..... just the ego.
@JaneJanie416 @wv_lacey @PaulaRobinett1 @JoeNBC Up until 3 months ago, he was quite scathing of Trump. He still is to a degree. But he’s become less scathing of the GOP players around Trump. It’s like he is torn between wanting Trump out, but not the GOP.
@jonathanvswan Maybe a wall kept them out.
@theheraldsun Thought it was a Godfrey’s ad.
@35magic42 @AndieHamblin @theheraldsun Great White Snorter
@MSNBC @JoeNBC Because many of his supporters wouldn’t know congress wasn’t in session. They are clueless as to the machinations in DC.
@soledadobrien No, just insipid.
@marcorubio @POTUS It was barbaric murder. Nothing else comes into it. It was a premeditated murder..... full stop.
@MailOnline That’s very racy
@realDonaldTrump He wanted to include Baader Meinhof, basque separatists, the Brigatte Rossa and others, but he couldn’t spell them.
@CBSNews No hard feelings?
@MWWatHome You obviously didn’t stand in line for any of that.
@LaurenWern DeSantis will probably end up voting for Gillum!
@ABC Couldn’t wait for the divorce
@WalshFreedom If they are prepared to legislate with long term detrimental effects on people, people are entitled to give them momentary uncomfortable experiences.
@dontworry66 @rohan_connolly @DeepSmoke2 Needs more commas.
@deemadigan Phil obviously feels he can reveal his true self now he doesn’t have to face an electorate.
@CNN @AprilDRyan Totally accidental though!!!
@kenolin1 Of course heel spurs would have been the easier and more sanitary option to achieve the same outcome!
@FOXFootyLive When did “rapt” become “wrapped”?
@TheSun That’s a bit racy
@SkyNewsAust @LaundyCraigMP @TonyAbbottMHR Tony “You bet you are. You bet I am” Abbott? That Tony Abbott?
@SkyNewsAust @theboltreport Bolt needs the Libs to fail so he has something to complain about.
@050Gala @CNN The last purchase was during Obama’s tenure for $25 bill. The Money that SA promise to spend but never fulfil, is always met by other nations constant modernising of their weapons. Don’t bother with that scaremongering bullshit.
@superfooty We have a game plan where players tackle the opposition.
@050Gala @CNN Systems integration between US and RU/Chinese manufacturers would be flawed and time consuming. Good luck with that..... actually no, you’re the evil empire.......
@khwalz If you don’t use the word ever, then you don’t tend to make ‘mistakes ‘ like that.
@RonnyLerner We fly as one less.
@khwalz https://t.co/2Nnb7zk2vs
@KyleWOrton @McFaul There are plenty of suppliers who would willingly step up to provide supply to US and diminish Saudi oil business. It’s quite a diverse supply economy now as opposed to the 70/80s
@SarahBurris Why invest anything in Saudis actions in the first place? They murder people in the street for non violent acts. 15 of their citizens helped fly planes into WTC towers! They are an evil empire.
@realDonaldTrump @RonDeSantisFL Next time..... turn the sound up.
@paigecardona Me too.
@laurajean591 @soledadobrien Of course the high level of minority representation within the GOP demonstrates a GOP in touch with modern America.......NOT. “Polite” racism is still racism. And that’s what the GOP are quietly demonstrating.
@ABC He needs a quick sharp alt right hook to the gob
@paigecardona I still don’t understand why McLarty would be delisted. He was an emergency for a fair chunk of the season.
@yashar A lot of people just don’t care. They don’t listen to the news and just roll with the punches. It’s a fact of life.
@3AW693 Wentworth voters saw the unique opportunity to elect someone other than a Lib. ALP were never going to win so many ALP voters would have availed themselves of the opportunity to vote for Phelps. It was an out of the ordinary situation.
@DavidJollyFL These politicians have no qualms about legislating to the detriment of their constituents, why can’t their constituents confront them and make their lives momentarily uncomfortable? There’s no need to escalate it beyond that though.
@JoeNBC HRC won the popular vote in 2016 by nearly 3 million. The Dems are way ahead of that polling this time year...... your scaremongering message isn’t needed.
@jaketapper @GlennKesslerWP @GregForMontana He has all the words but none of the actions.
@lilyk2 @ragipsoylu @davidfrum He’s used to people thinking what he tells them to think.
@treasonstickers There isn’t even a contract for them. It’s a shopping list that the Saudi’s provide to every incoming US president to curry favour. The last sales were under Obama for $25 billion. The shopping lists never match the eventual sales in $ terms.
@CNNSotu @SenBobCorker What did Trump know and when did he know it? If he knew that Khashoggi was to be in any way harmed prior to it happening, that has to be a removal from office offence if he refused to try and prevent it.
@thomps_p @davidmweissman No one gets to determines someone else’s right time, right place. Peaceful protest should be one of the foundations of any resilient democracy whenever it occurs.
@JohnJHarwood The people have the right to protest their politicians who vote against their wishes and needs. The people didn’t start this hostility, but they certainly aren’t going to cede any ability to make these politicians lives uncomfortable now.
@SkyNewsAust @rowandean @LiberalAus @TurnbullMalcolm The comedy festival isn’t until April, he’s gone too early with his routine!
@SkyNewsAust @adamgiles Test him for drugs.
@AdilAlsuhaim @barkley_al @nihonmama @BershodM @ragipsoylu @Sabah How could you have believed that nonsense? Of course they were always going to be the ones who made him disappear. They kill people in the streets if they choose to. A critic of the regime is fair game and has always been. They are scumbags.
@TSBoyle @SportingSpud Play the anthem,  bounce the ball. Stop all this other muck that ends up looking second rate during the daytime.
@hughhewitt @ddknyt He probably would have hoped not to be hacksawed to death. I’m not sure he’s going to have any thoughts beyond that.
@DaddyDaddymac It’d be better if it didn’t apply to anyone. But peoples are peoples. You should all have the right to kill each other equally apparently.
@Jonkeren2525 @ebruenig They’re as bad as each other in a lot of respects.  But I do note, there were 15 saudis who flew planes into American skyscrapers, no Iranians though.
@paulcaruso2 @briannatravers @theheraldsun @DanielAndrewsMP @JacintaAllanMP My sister lives about a mile from there.
@paulcaruso2 @briannatravers @theheraldsun @DanielAndrewsMP @JacintaAllanMP These removals are the best thing for someone whose work is time reliant. And they are no small undertaking for each and every removal. Massive projects.
@paulcaruso2 @briannatravers @theheraldsun @DanielAndrewsMP @JacintaAllanMP It is
@9NewsAUS Its his prerogative.
@ReneeLibby2 I thought that would be called “The Abyss...mal”
@RobertT113968 @chelseahandler I was using a little bit of literary license of course
@TomthunkitsMind @barbs73 Your idiot father is expected to come down HARD on these scumbags.
@TonyHWindsor Plenty of judgement, from those watching.
@lenoretaylor More coal.
@PaulBongiorno @ScottMorrisonMP He needs to knight himself immediately for courage under extreme mediocrity.
@Piping_Shrike @GrogsGamut I’m hoping he stays!!!
@chelseahandler Who’d get in his car? Jeff Dahmer?
@warringahvoices He will deny that too!
@arozenbachs Obviously not a belieber
@nadinevoncohen They’re moving the embassy to Damascus now!
@JohnBirmingham No happy clapping tomorrow I’d say.
@guardian Anyone is a man in comparison to Trump.
@asmith702 @hardhouz13 Ecuador are hoping the right to remain silent.
@Pervaizistan @thedailybeast The only thing they can be proud of is that natural selection hasn’t caught up to them yet.
@channeltennews Make him appear in Quito. Let’s see how that works out for him.
@JohnWDean I know he’s as dumb as dog shit.
@CBSNews It was like listening to a Dave Chappelle skit.
@bennyjohnson Because Charlottesville didn’t count!!!
@RooLivesAgain32 @leighjtaylor @carybain @superfooty Apparently it was to Geelong. They can determine the value on their player.
@Dudeguyy @AnonGForce @DLeonhardt Don’t confuse him with difficult concepts.
@MikeZahara @RosenforNevada Lol. I’m sure the drugstore in Stepford has your Zoloft back in stock.
@mviser @dvorakoelling Grandad doesn’t seem to be too accepting of granddaughter
@gtconway3d Which part of that is hard to believe?
@CBSNews Vote, don’t shoot.
@iM_SMS @NeverTrumpTexan @jeniferfenton @jslacker2 @gnuseibeh The old evil empire really fucked this one up. What’s their next story going to be?
@iM_SMS @NeverTrumpTexan @jeniferfenton @jslacker2 @gnuseibeh To get fired upon.
@NeverTrumpTexan @iM_SMS @jeniferfenton @jslacker2 @gnuseibeh Driving in Riyadh I’d say.
@iM_SMS @NeverTrumpTexan @jeniferfenton @jslacker2 @gnuseibeh I’m reporting you to your Saudi supervisors for failing to be convincing.
@aliShihabi They lied once, twice, three times...... they’re lying this time too.
@AdilAlsuhaim @barkley_al @nihonmama @BershodM @ragipsoylu @Sabah The lying scumbags have admitted it. Now where’s the body?
@waltshaub This “excuse” is a works in progress. Where does it fall down? The next version can be made better, I’m sure!
@Dangchick1 @GOP We can’t change your last vote. We can try and change your next one though.
@JohnAmato @gollum1419_g They’re introducing them to MMA next year.
@kenolin1 Filth
@WalshFreedom @CoryBooker The worlds most litigious society and the worlds largest tomes of law and regulations tends to suggest ‘freedom’ is a distant memory. Opportunity yes, freedom....... not so much.
@CBSNews He needs to believe that because otherwise he’d have to confront the reality that the outdated rules of celibacy and unsupervised access to children is the inherent problem in the organisation.
@CheriJacobus The potential outcomes of their legal issues have political implications.
@RodriguezBertie @jaketapper What flavour of kool aid are you drinking today?
@thehill Low act to make public a private message.
@maggieNYT I don’t know what it is, but it wasn’t exactly cutting edge comedy.
@fawfulfan Old black people............ the depths they will go to. It wouldn’t surprise me if votes go missing from certain districts.
@ericaleighT @boethiolus The atheists I know aren’t in the least interested in “converting” anyone to atheism. How do you teach rationalism to someone intent on being irrational?
@JoeBarri Trump has been attacking Latinos since he went down that escalator, Latinos can’t say they haven’t been contacted. They’ve been contacted alright, they don’t need to be invited to the resistance. They should be queuing already without any need to be singled out for invitation.
@AncientAndAngry @DaveSharma Who cares!
@TiffanyA_MAGA @AhronRShapiro @chriskkenny I never said that at all. I questioned the person’s premise that because one specific circumstance wasn’t affected that another wouldn’t be either. Are you trying to run a particular narrative?
@TiffanyA_MAGA @AhronRShapiro @chriskkenny We are talking a developing economy dealing with an economy that is 21% of world GDP as opposed to one with less than 2% world GDP. The implications and reactions will never be the same.
@hughhewitt Your mate Don Jnr said he was part of Al Queda.
@MatthewWolfff @1Jedi_Rey @NWPinPDX @debbiesideris @ListenToEzra @Havok_2O18 @TrinityResists @NatCookResists @JynErso_2017 @briantylercohen Trump knows this will come out, but he’d prefer the Saudi’s put themselves in for it rather than the US forcing the issue.
@DaveismOfficial @LV_Express Pity.
@DaveismOfficial @LV_Express I wonder if they’re regretting that now that the Mid Gippy is remaining the same bar their presence. Seems to me they jumped too early without waiting to see the outcome of this process.
@LV_Express @DaveismOfficial You don’t mention what Yarragon are going to do.
@AhronRShapiro @chriskkenny Why is it then that Trump is too scared to piss off the Saudi’s and cites the potential to lose $110 billion in arms sales, which is a lie because they don’t have a contract for any of that. If upsetting a nation impacts trade for one, it surely applies to others. True?
@nowthisnews Ouch
@george_capen Wouldn’t a 15 man bus crash been the more efficient scenario?
@BanTorture @JoeNBC @ASFried Just because you or anyone can’t figure out the logic to something, doesn’t mean that the explanation given isn’t reasonable or incorrect. Plenty of politicians get done for their crimes, including the former house speaker.
@BanTorture @JoeNBC @ASFried Blame them then if you want. HE was 2000 miles away.
@BanTorture @JoeNBC @ASFried Who cares what his behaviour was like. We was 2000 miles away. He could do handstands and hold a parade, he was still 2000 miles away!
@LuciaPaduto I believe he was murdered not so much for his criticism of Trump but more for his calls for further SA reforms and using the powerful medium of the WaPo to do it.
@BanTorture @JoeNBC @ASFried He was in DC at the time. It would take some fancy footwork to orchestrate her cardiac arrhythmia all the way from DC.
@TomArnold @JohnJHarwood @ScottFeinberg @DonaldJTrumpJr His heel spurs prevented that happening.
@3AW693 They’re not Australian.
@bellat1999 @CandaceTX I thought I was listening to a Dave Chappelle race skit.
@j_desarno You could see that joke coming 3 days ago.
@JohnJHarwood He’s had an ongoing war with the truth.
@TradeIdeas1 @oliverdarcy No one wants to see your personal photos.
@Section10Pod @dandrezner @KateUpton Do the Astro’s know what hand signals go with that?
@gtconway3d Any and everything to shield Trump.
@jaketapper The essence is the same. Kushner wants Trump to ride out the news cycle. Which is code for: start a new scandal so this one goes away and they won’t be held to public scrutiny.
@Acosta If it wasn’t for those damned heel spurs!
@DrDenaGrayson She’s very choosy as to what she wants to get to the bottom of.
@ZekeJMiller Ol heel spurs hasn’t got the courage to fight his own fights, that’s why he hero worships his legion of thugs and particularly when it involves journalists.
@ethan_meldrum @DanielCherny The umpire signals a boundary, not the batsman!
@WalshFreedom Trump wouldn’t body slam anyone because his heel spurs would flare up prior to contact.
@iamnotpussykins @freetomato @kathygriffin I’m not sure that’s his hair.
@TheRickWilson Thats the same dope who bought Trump’s yacht to help bail Trump out of financial strife.
@seungminkim What the hell does that mean?
@kaitlancollins Kelly won’t, it seems he relishes being a player in politics no matter the angst involved.
@swin24 Has he thought about a full beard coz what he’s got going there reminds me of a post 2000 waxing advertisement for women.
@kanecornes @TJch9 The gift that keeps on giving.
@MattOrtega Reminded me of the race skits Chappelle used to do.
@GeorgeTakei He was at a beach party drinking alcohol.
@maggieNYT Unfortunately........ because he and Kushner have some connection to MbS’ crackdown and possible profiting from providing information on MbS’ enemies.
@iamnotpussykins @freetomato @kathygriffin Not exactly
@DearAuntCrabby I’m not worried.
@KaitMarieox Empty vessel
@TheRickWilson The state aspect would be a little chilling to those in Trump circles.
@AP He’s going to charge them more for his condos.
@GenMhayden They’re coming to work at Trump Hotels.
@3L3V3NTH It’s what we call a gunt
@SenatorCollins Oh..... you want to get to the bottom of this one......!!!
@NBCNews @NBCLeftField That bloke is missing a bicep
@olgaNYC1211 @Will_Bunch More to come
@workmanalice @lenoretaylor He must have spent a long time in pre school.
@freetomato @kathygriffin That’s some roof over the tool shed!
@1116sen I used to watch his efforts to chase defensively in 2010/11.......... they were efforts, he would barely jog. He would want to have turned that around. It only takes one player to break the wall of pressure.
@terrenceturner @susan_tidrick @fivefifths Like Trump only got $1 million from his dad type autobiographical?
@PasteIpunk @MaddowBlog @MSNBC Unfortunately American voting regulations are state based. Why the hell for federal elections there isn’t a uniform federal voting method and code for qualification is beyond me. The concept of one person one vote should demand such consistency.
@JoyceWhiteVance Every citizen should automatically be enrolled to vote once they turn 18 and be able to turn up to vote without any issue of eligibility.
@AlistairTaurus @newscomauHQ Why don’t you try and pray the legislation away. Let me know how that goes.
@AlistairTaurus @newscomauHQ I read a medical doctor tried to impose his morality. He is not a morality doctor, he is a medical doctor. Either provide the service you trade in or shut the fuck up about shit that doesn’t concern you.
@AlistairTaurus @newscomauHQ The doctor shouldn’t be making choices for anyone. Coming from someone who believes in a god, why don’t you blame that god for the 40% of all conceptions that miscarry? Is that god’s plan?
@AlistairTaurus @newscomauHQ It’s not a child. It’s a foetus. Make decisions for yourself and let other wrestle with their conscience. It’s not yours to make determinations over.
@AlistairTaurus @newscomauHQ Then that doctor shouldn’t have an abortion. Leave the decision up to the person involved, that is the woman.
@tears_go__by @LocalFamily I still believe the Dems need an attack dog, someone who is more than happy to go toe to toe in all the dirty fights. But once the air is clear, you still need someone standing who has remained above the pack to lead. That could be Warren, it could be Harris.
@tears_go__by @LocalFamily Obama shouldn’t have lowered himself to answer the nonsense. The conservatives need to latch onto any talking point that involves taking down a threat any way they can. I wouldn’t be using their behaviour as a reason to enter their game.
@nihonmama @AdilAlsuhaim @barkley_al @BershodM @ragipsoylu @Sabah Until this regime that executes people for non violent crimes is destroyed, it will remain an evil empire. The citizens have no or minimal impact on the running of the country.
@tears_go__by @LocalFamily She has a stage to use that not many have. She’s been effective so far. This DNA thing just played into the game he wants to play. Now he will play on the 1/512th aspect, she’s given him the coffee to ridicule that aspect now.
@nihonmama @AdilAlsuhaim @barkley_al @BershodM @ragipsoylu @Sabah My response which has been consistent for decades, since they executed a Saudi Princess 40 years ago is that they are the evil empire.
@LocalFamily @RadioFreeTom @CharlesPPierce If Warren has Presidential aspirations, she shouldn’t play Trump’s game. She should defeat him with ideas, words, policies, vision and providing hope. Trump’s claims are beneath anyone’s dignity to try and discredit. Let others with no such aspirations take him on.
@nihonmama @AdilAlsuhaim @barkley_al @BershodM @ragipsoylu @Sabah He’s an apologist. He probably knows it’s true, but has an agenda to deny, deny, deny even in the face of overwhelming evidence.
@JenGreer @SarahBurris Unbelievable!!!
@CheriJacobus May be? Never a surer thing!
@AdilAlsuhaim @barkley_al @nihonmama @BershodM @ragipsoylu @Sabah I didn’t misquote. It’s a cover up. On both the US government and Saudi’s behalf. Stop being an apologist for these scumbags.
@CheriJacobus @highbrow_nobrow So Trump sells him out later by sending Kushner over to Saudi Arabia with his name on a hit list to silence one way or another.
@AdilAlsuhaim @barkley_al @nihonmama @BershodM @ragipsoylu @Sabah Obfuscation.
@AdilAlsuhaim @barkley_al @nihonmama @BershodM @ragipsoylu @Sabah So they have the facts, but need to investigate the facts they already know? Word salad. They murdered him, everyone knows it, they’re just trying to find a scapegoat to deflect from the piece of shit prince.
@AdilAlsuhaim @barkley_al @nihonmama @BershodM @ragipsoylu @Sabah Because as Pompeo said, Saudi Arabia dont want to talk about the facts. They murdered him. Stop being an apologist for these scumbags.
@VoteMarsha @ChrisCoxNRA Over 3 gun deaths a day in Tennessee. You must be proud.
@yashar I don’t expect to ever hear or see this bloke again. He’s gone back to Saudi Arabia....... you do the maths.
@KFILE I want to know who the clowns were who donated $80!
@PuestoLoco @Lawrence @Alwaleed_Talal You forgot to add $500 mill investment in Kushner property after Kushner delivers list.
@Lawrence Both
@RechecktoCheck @ReutersPolitics That’s what I’m referring to.
@raffiguiragoss5 @tuetuekay @CNN Word salad.
@DouthatNYT Ideological innovations? You mean greed and division? Hardly unique philosophies, it’s just that Trump has pulled back the facade that tried to make them respectable. Trump has an ideology of ‘self’.
