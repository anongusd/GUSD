@realDonaldTrFan Mr. Trump, you now talking like someone who is loosing his mind. I thought you lost it long ago. You can't run your own fake companies, how on earth do you think you can run this country? Just open the government and allow citizens to get their lives back.

How much did the Russians payed him. Did the payment come through the NRA? Republicans are trying to end the investigation because they are aware of the Russians influence and money on the GOP. Seriously, l'm curious to know. https://t.co/ddXjC5cNqk
@SenSanders This president is acting out. His behavior is getting to be a dangerous one for the country. The Robert Mueller investigation is getting closer to the Oval office doors.  Why on Earth would he invite Putin to the country? He wants him to approve the election? Why now?
@tribelaw Maybe he will then walk it back. The guy is mentally ill, he is not capable of running the country. The damage he's causing now will take years to fix. In four years, we will all be losing our minds just like he has. God help us all.
Rand Paul is just an idiot as the president. He is educated illitrate. https://t.co/jV0UghSG3A
@keithellison @realDonaldTrump He should see how ridiculous he is, standing by Putin, and throwing America intelligent agencies under the bus while Putin protecting his. What are we waiting for at this point, to throw him out of the White House, when hear of secrets he gave Putin during their meeting?
@iancarty123 @RWPUSA @daschmidt883 It's long passed the time he should be out of office. As l have said many times, this guy is dangerous to this country. Those that keep supporting him in Congress should be out of office with him.
@TomThom2199 @peterfitzinya @Comey Tom, you should be ashamed of yourself. You trust Putin, if you are able to say something like that don't you think people are going to call you out? Any American whether you support Trump or not should be able to tell him he is wrong when he is. That's HONESTY my man.
@RyanLizza Maybe he is. Do we know what US secrets he is going to hand out to Putin when they meet, as nobody will be in the meeting? Remember the two Russians in the White House? Seriously, this should be a concern for all Americans. Trump is dangerous, how much more damage can he cause?
@TravisAllen02 @MalcolmNance This guy doesn't deserve even the tea meeting he got.
@MarleneGreen @AmandiOnAir He is going to ask Putin to do all the can get his men hack November election to e to elect Republicans for him to avoid impeachment. Why he wants one on one with Putin with no one else around. This moron is not protecting this country. He needs to be out of office.
@BrookeKilpatri5 @RWPUSA @xtrixcyclex @ABC Yes it's real and he has more room for Trump face. He needs to add that before he goes in the can for some time.
@kurteichenwald They don't see it that way. I'm surprised just as well as you and some Americans. Trump gets on stage and hugs the American flag, why can't he hug the country and fight the man who ordered the attach on America residential election. It's attacks on the USA.
@ChrisLu44 @MalcolmNance The guy is a moron. He has no respect even for himself, can't show up on time when meeting the queen. I keep saying that this man needs a psychiatrist. Seriously, there is something wrong with him. We all need to take his behavior seriously. He is embarrassing US 24/7.
@lanrav56 @AnandWrites They are allowing this man to have his way in everything, it's about time they start letting him know that Fox is the fake news channel. He was calling all the news stations during the campaign, they became fake news after the election, now he only deals with FOX.
Why worry, Newt has no shame. He shamed and made a great fool of himself while in Congress and lost his leadership, an educated illitrate. https://t.co/eYmFeFomHH
@AmyLaurenSomers @TheRickWilson So now do everything understand why Republicans are so determined  to end the investigation. A person running for office is involved. Maybe it's a republican. We will soon find out, before the next indictment who that person is.
@jonallendc @TheRickWilson Please, this guy denial everything, we shouldn't think for a minute he will own it. This is a mentally disturb individual. His behavior had reached the point where Americans need to wake up. Most of all the Republicans in Congress have to watch their behavior on TV. Shameful.

That shouldn't surprise any body. How is Trump going to be remembered after leaving the White House?
