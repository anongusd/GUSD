@mschlapp If he is a liar, then the press calling him out on it is actually what is known in the business as REPORTING THE FACTS.
@ABC We do it when we fly with our 3 year old, but we shouldn't have to. Prior to gifts when we boarded w/our 3 kids under 10 we either got looks of sympathy to adults saying nasty insults to our children and causing my then 8 yr old child with CP to have a panic attack. Now silence.
@CvvW11235 Pre OKC bombing, u cld carry guns everywhere, including inside court houses.  Post OKC bombing pre-9/11 you couldn't carry them in gov buildings, but could still carry them most places. Post 9/11 almost everywhere banned firearms. Shooters felt empowered cause no one to stop them
@CvvW11235 Supreme Court ruled a while ago that police are not obligated to protect people. I am a firm believer that allowing responsible gun owners to carry, fewer people will die in mass shootings.  There is a reason why there are more mass shootings after 9/11 than before.

#Scammer #ScamAlert @ ka_slaughter is a scammer. Juanita Levy sent me a PM saying she had information on a government grant.  These are always scams. While I didn't play this one out to the end, they usually ask for a "processing fee" or "IRS fee". Don't fall for it.
@joedawg49 No, I lead them down the road to get as much information as I could about their scam to warn others who would have bought it. I did my due diligence and pass along as much detail as possible to all governing authorities as well as the general public.
@AltThesis The Supreme Court ruled that the police are not required to protect the public. When it comes to police dealing with women, many still play the "hysteria" or "you should be flattered they were interested in you" We have to protect ourselves. They can't jail us all. #SafetyFirst

@SnowballManny @patmsteph101 @independentat11 @RepMarkMeadows I know the law and while it is true he didn't actually break the law, he used it in a way to abuse his power in the Executive branch, not an actual emergency. Even Trump said there was no emergency, he just didn't want to wait anymore.
@SnowballManny @patmsteph101 @independentat11 @RepMarkMeadows If your child went to the emergency room, would you leave that child there and go play golf?
@SnowballManny @patmsteph101 @independentat11 @RepMarkMeadows /4 But I do have this parting thought for you. Will your opinions change when Trump is either A) in jail for his criminal activity or B) steps down from office to protect his own ass from going to jail?  I won't be checking any responses.
@SnowballManny @patmsteph101 @independentat11 @RepMarkMeadows /3 You have every right to believe what you want.  Based on the way you and others have spoken to people, you are not truly interested in anything other than your version of the truth, even if it is tainted by lies and blind loyalty. I wish you all the best in life.
@SnowballManny @patmsteph101 @independentat11 @RepMarkMeadows /2 If this was a true emergency, Trump wouldn't be lining his and his families pockets with our tax payer money sitting at one of his own resorts instead of being in the @WhiteHouse handling the #FAKENationalEmergency .
@SnowballManny @patmsteph101 @independentat11 @RepMarkMeadows Oh I readily admit I don't know everything. I do know the definition of emergency is: a serious, UNEXPECTED, and often dangerous situation requiring immediate action.  		Based on the intel from the agencies involved, the southern border does NOT qualify as an actual emergency.
@Beachbu17948493 @SnowballManny @independentat11 @RepMarkMeadows Walls have to be continuously repaired, they are single purpose. They are the most fallible of defenses, even with supplemental security like drones and agents. They give a placebo effect of security, not actual security.  Even walls around rich homes only keep out the innocent
@Beachbu17948493 @SnowballManny @independentat11 @RepMarkMeadows If we are going to talk about the % of just kids, the majority of children forced into child prostitution and slave labor are us citizens, not foreign children. For the record, it isn't just children who are victims of human trafficking
@Beachbu17948493 @SnowballManny @independentat11 @RepMarkMeadows So, paying agents vs a wall means they can be reassigned when issues, like at ports come up. I didn't say no drugs, but even cartels &amp; human trafficers, with the volume they send do it via boats, planes, and a small percent via semis that cross at legal entry checkpoints.
@patmsteph101 @SnowballManny @independentat11 @RepMarkMeadows I have lived on the border, thanks!
@keith_lindahl @SnowballManny @independentat11 @RepMarkMeadows Even addicts make choices.  They chose not to get help. They chose to continue to take drugs.  Drug addiction is not a disease, it is 100% a choice, just like drinking and driving, taking a gun and shooting someone. 2% of drugs come thru so border, a wall is a waste. #NoWallEver
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Most drugs don't come thru the so border. Facts from intel agencies prove. Why r u still siding with @POTUS when he has called a #FAKENationalEmergency. He is at 1 of his own resorts on our money, which is illegal. U used to be the party of integrity, is the $ more important?

@SnowballManny @independentat11 @RepMarkMeadows A wall isn't the solution though. For the same funds, you can hire 70k agents @ $70k a year for 10 yrs. You could also purchase drones and armored vehicles to supplement agents for less $$ than wall maintenance. Smart security is what is required and wall isn't it.

@SnowballManny @independentat11 @RepMarkMeadows Medical coverage for the poor, homelessness, mental health care, meaningful gun violence prevention are national emergencies.

@SnowballManny @independentat11 @RepMarkMeadows Illegals are not killing millions, they are killing less than hundreds.

Our nation isn't in crisis from the south, it is people dying because they can't afford meds
@RepMarkMeadows You have backed @POTUS for too long. You should have stepped up months ago instead of siding with the wall. Your record is public and we the people will remember next election. I am glad you are stepping up now to fight the toddler king, but it is almost too little too late.

@TrueM0derate @RyanAFournier It is very easy, especially a dead person's.  I know it is scary to think about since we all use our SSN's for our credit and identity, but the truth is, co's pay people to get them SSN numbers, and they do use the Dark Web. I am going to assume you are purposely being obtuse
@TrueM0derate @RyanAFournier fake in the sense that it wasn't assigned to legally, not fake in the sense it was never issued by the IRS.  I apologize for not making this more clear.
@TrueM0derate @RyanAFournier There are whole dark web sites devoted to selling active and accurate social security numbers.  You would be surprised how cheap they are. I actually discovered this information after having my child's identity stolen.
@TrueM0derate @RyanAFournier Actually, it is very easy to get social security numbers of dead people and they really aren't validated outside the fact if they are issued or not.  The IRS does monitor through an algorithm income/profits vs payroll taxes and this is a large flag for them.
@Caesar2040 @RyanAFournier No, asshat, what I said was the statement made by Mr. Fournier was not accurate.  I didn't say it was right or wrong, just pointing out data inaccuracy.
@TrueM0derate @RyanAFournier See my response to your previous message.
@TrueM0derate @RyanAFournier Actually they do, most have fake ssn's assigned to them by their employers on the back end.  It is how the employers avoid getting audited by the IRS.  While businesses can pay a certain number of workers under the table, if their income to wage tax is off, they are flagged.

@Wirlvoice @real_farmacist spanking is not physical abuse, just like groundings aren't mental abuse.  But you go ahead and raise children who behave like this one did and blame everyone and everything else when they have to face the consequences of their actions.
@Wirlvoice @real_farmacist You want to raise assholes that feel entitled and can't handle when they are wrong, please do it somewhere else.  I don't want you infecting my children with nonsense. These children don't function in normal society. She did get violent over having to follow the rules.
@Wirlvoice @real_farmacist While that is true, displacement of blame is just as bad.  Most of us were spanked &amp; aren't violent.  Not holding a child acctble for their actions is negligence. There's nothing wrong with physical discomfort punishment if it doesn't cross into abuse (and spanking isn't illegal)
@UlrichJvV ignoring ignorance in a single bound
@Wirlvoice @real_farmacist Violence doesn't breed more violence or we would be a society of chaos and bedlum since any of us over 30 got paddled at least once in our lives. Sometimes, when non-violent solutions like time outs don't work, physical discomfort punishments are appropriate and should b used.
@Wirlvoice @real_farmacist Do you know why there weren't all these behavior problems even 30 years ago?.Because of consequences &amp; personal accountability.  Both of those are missing in society today. Bad actions are never a child's fault, it is because they weren't hugged or loved enough or some other bs.
@Wirlvoice @real_farmacist If any of my children behaved this way, I would be insisting they spend some time in juvie to learn what real problems are.  Her behavior is over her being asked to put away her cell phone. Grow the fuck up, this is not ok and extreme action will be met with extreme consequence.
@Wirlvoice @real_farmacist That is not a tantrum, that is criminal violence that put other in harms way.  Your justifying the child's behavior as being acceptable is why we have school shootings.

@Wirlvoice @real_farmacist If a minor is violent toward other kids &amp; adults in this manner, they ABSOLUTELY should expect physical repercussions. This is the problem today, ppl don't discipline kids so we have kids that feel entitled to behave violently and then ppl act shocked when consequences happen.
@Erin_412 @Christinelb563 @flipsville @nowthisnews SHE CAUSED A VIOLENT SITUATION IN A SCHOOL FULL OF CHILDREN!!!  You would not be so fluffy about it if she had a gun and shot kids instead of flipping desks and hitting and kicking police officers because she was told to follow the rules. WAKE THE FUCK UP!
@sapphicosmos @nowthisnews This child flipped desks in a classroom full of children for being told to get off her phone.  If she can do that , who is to say she didn't continue to fight as they were removing her from the classroom. She instigated school violence.
@WalshFreedom To me, the issue is not and never was guns.  It is mental illness, no true process for gun ownership. Not that any politicians care because it doesn't cause controversy, but every 2 years must go through psych eval and gun safety test and range test. If you can't pass, no guns
@100_Disable_vet That is hysterical https://t.co/fyJOrhC1Mq
@Wirlvoice @real_farmacist Stunning is different from shooting.  The point being, we don't have all the facts of this case and because she is a minor, there will be things that can't be released to the public. The fact she flipped desks in class, as a parent, would be troubling. School violence is no joke
@real_farmacist I want to point out this video says she has a history of behavior issues and she flipped desks in class for being told to get off her phone.  If there were other incidents of violence from this student, possible response was warranted. My child act that way, stun his ass.

@Jen63343443 @benvaessen1 @Wodins @RepMarkMeadows Actually, in the previous 2 years, they did not even bring it to a vote, so he had no idea if he had 60 votes or not.  The House never attempted it, even though Paul Ryan was speaker.

@LipstickBonds @Wodins @RepMarkMeadows Again, no one is saying no security, we are saying no wall, there is a difference. No one wants criminals, but we want smart security, not something that doesn't truly fix the issue, which is legal ports and entry ways as well as overstaying visas.
@LipstickBonds @Wodins @RepMarkMeadows Ideally no illegals, but 2 is less than .01%..  Better options would be drones &amp; more agents covering the ground. Do you realize that you can hire 70k agents @ $70k/yr for 10 years that can be sent where needed for less money as the wall? Security &amp; jobs = win win for the country
@Jen63343443 @Wodins @RepMarkMeadows Actually, the recommendation from DHS was drones and more staff and repairs to existing walls so they don't fall in disrepair.  There is not a single leader of DHS that was not Trump appointed that supports or backs the wall. Only Trump-puppets do.
@Jen63343443 @benvaessen1 @Wodins @RepMarkMeadows Trump is only willing to hear about the wall.  This is not supported by the people, whom he works for.  The wall is truly about a monument to his presidency.  If it were that important, they would have fully funded it in the 2 years the Republicans fully controlled everything.
@Jen63343443 @benvaessen1 @Wodins @RepMarkMeadows Securing the border means a lot more than a wall.  Personally, I want border security, but I would rather see drones, more agents, more technology.  I want it to protect us from any entry point, not just the Southern Border. That is the problem with the wall, it only has one use.

@RashidaTlaib @senatemajldr Time to vote no confidence and Mitch be removed from Senate Majority.

@MarkDurant1963 @liz72285876 @BlazeTV She may be a Rep, but she doesn't have to meet with an angry mob, no one does, not even the Presidential Toddler.  They experienced a tragedy, but reasoning that because a few people were killed by illegals is why a wall is good allows mass shootings to justify no guns. https://t.co/Wr4gyQQ6I5
@MarkDurant1963 @TMLEFLER @BlazeTV And there you show your colors.  Your opinions are not based in fact, just bigotry.  I hope you never have a daughter.
@AOC You are an amazing person.  Whether I agree with all of your ideas or not, I can only hope that my niece becomes even 1/2 the person you are with your courage to overcome and your self worth.  I may not always agree, but I will always support you.
@Mothersdream @donnagailgab @GayRepublicSwag I am not saying there aren't cases where you will see higher rates, but overall, rates went down while benefits went up.
@Mothersdream @donnagailgab @GayRepublicSwag Not true.  Prior to the Affordable Healthcare act, as a contractor that had to pay for my own health care, I paid $875/mo for health insurance for my family of 3 and it didn't cover my pregnancy because I was 45 days pregnant.  The same plan under AHA was only $630/mo.
@donnagailgab @GayRepublicSwag They can be, depending on what carrier. That is the problem with letting things like health insurance be for profit private sector businesses.

@Lugnutjoe31 @Paulie63891499 @TalbertSwan While Dinesh has an interesting take on different moments in our history, he is largely a conspiracy theorist that only takes extremes into account. I have read his works and there are a lot of holes in his work.
@Paulie63891499 @Lugnutjoe31 @TalbertSwan How sad for you that you don't know the history of the United States.
@Lugnutjoe31 Let's be real, no politician or party is for the people. Regarding Repubs - no one said they magically flipped.  Current Repubs are the Former Southern Democrat party.  Current day Republicans have voted against civil rights and religious freedoms for more than 6 decades.
@TMLEFLER @BlazeTV No one in any elected position, from mayor of a large city up just takes walk ins. While it is sad what happened to these families, fewer are killed by illegal immigrants than in mass shootings. No wall, hire 100k more border agents @$70k for 10/yr. same $$ more effective
@GayRepublicSwag If you are relatively healthy and have some savings, look for Bronze level plans.  Also, try looking for Insurance co-ops.
@SecNielsen They shouldn't have to work for free you ignoramus.  That is the point @SpeakerPelosi was making.
@Lugnutjoe31 @TalbertSwan While that is true, this all changed between 1860 - 1936.   It also means that Republicans are no longer for the people.  Also, Lincoln wasn't going to free slaves until pressure from Abolistionists forced his hand, so let's not get high and mighty. https://t.co/NVLQEPBswQ

@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump It isn't a deal if one side gets everything they want and the other side gets nothing. They gave you a solution and it was turned down because it didn't include a dime for the wall. Same cost would hire 100k agents @ $70k/yr for 8 yrs. Create jobs not waste

@100_Disable_vet If he tells the truth, it will be eye opening. Regardless of what he says, the other side will say he is lying, so any reputation he has is destroyed.
@dtcfl @RepMarkMeadows You call me a troll but I come at this with facts and an actual solution. If we really had a crisis, this wall would have been started in the 2 yrs the GOP controlled the Legislative branch.
@Taeler_Hendrix George "the animal" Steele.
@WalshFreedom You are right. We have put ourselves into the position of getting someone like Trump.
@siano2020 I feel you. I have a pretty toxic relationship with 1 of my parents. Hang in there.
@adviseagainstit @RepMarkMeadows Actually the government's job is to follow the constitution and to create, enforce, and lead existing laws. The wall is not what's needed. Same $ could hire 100k agent at $70k/yr for 8 years. Creating jobs and creating a solution to help with all points of entry not just south.
@Lexie7703 @RepMarkMeadows Actually, I have done a lot of research. The truth is a wall is a single faceted tool. We need thoughtful discussion on real world solutions, like hiring more border agents. The wall costs the same as 700k+ agents making 70k a year for a year. Create jobs not waste.
@BerlantRiff Most people in human traffic rings cone through open port, not the southern border. They are separate. Instead of an immovable wall that serves only 1 purpse, why not hire 100k agents at $70k for 8 years? It addresses jobs, they are flexible to the situation. Better solution
@ourlibertyfirst @RepMarkMeadows I realize,  based on your lashing out like a child that you are probably a fundamentalist but for the record, I vote Republican. Unlike most kool-aid drinkers, I think for myself and do research before I start spouting bull shit. I save that for fertilizing my garden.
@ourlibertyfirst @RepMarkMeadows There is actually a lot of data on undocumented immigrants. Undocumented refers to having no visa. Please educate yourself.
@RepMarkMeadows You work for every person that lives in your district, not just those that donated to you and definitely not Trump.  Polls have shown the vast majority of Americans don't want the money spent on a wall, especially when there are better options that would also create jobs.
@RepMarkMeadows There IS NO NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH SOUTHERN BORDER CROSSING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.  There are multiple studies showing that southern border immigration of illegal immigrants has steadily dropped in the last 10 yrs without the monument to a failed presidency.
@RepMarkMeadows Do your job and open up the government without the damn wall. That is a separate discussion and should not be crippling our nation more than a few illegal immigrants. #DoYouDamnJob #YourFired #ImpeachTheMFer
@RepMarkMeadows The US Senate unanimously voted bills to reopen the government. The fact that the House is allowing the Executive Branch to dictate their actions means that Republicans are violating the spirit of how our Democracy was set up. No one branch was meant to have control of any other.
@motocoaster @ScottRogers_WV @MyWVTravels @maddow @washingtonpost @wvgazettemail @CCARRanson @StopRockwool I have read several reports based on science for the type of emissions this factory will put out.  While there are some risks, like with anything in life, some science is being twisted or overstated to twist uneducated people to a certain view point. I have researched too.
@Alyssa_Milano You know $5B will pay for 700k border patrol making 70k a year for 1 year. Even of we had 100k more that is 100k new jobs at a living wage and no need for a wal because they could more than cover the territory and they are multifunctional
@arizonageri @anataliedz1 @RepMarkMeadows While I can appreciate your passion, the fact you make personal attacks about me when challenged when I have not done the same to you tells me more about the place where that passion comes from and it isn't healthy, so I am going to bid you a great evening &amp; wish you the best
@arizonageri @anataliedz1 @RepMarkMeadows And statistically, we are all in more danger of being assaulted or killed by a Christian white man who drank hater-aid than someone crossing the border so they can pick vegetables or clean a hotel room.  What should we be focused on, many violent crimes or a few?
@arizonageri @anataliedz1 @RepMarkMeadows We need intelligent security, not a wall.  A wall is like trying to hold back the tide with a teaspoon.  stops a trickle, but you still get flooded.  That same money can hire 70K+ full time agents.  Then we have people employed.  2 birds with 1 stone and a better option.
@arizonageri @anataliedz1 @RepMarkMeadows I have actually lived in a border town in Texas for several years and yes I have seen people cross. I have also seen legal citizens in those towns rape the women and violently torture and beat the men.  A wall won't stop this they will go over and under.  We need people to patrol

@WalshFreedom Yeah, I had a similar thought. He can save face, demonize any who oppose him, keep his fundamentalist base. Say what you will about him, his greasy snake oil salesmanship allows him to slide through a lot of crap
@arizonageri @anataliedz1 @RepMarkMeadows Actually out border is not hemmoraging. That is a lie and the figures being put out by the administration are for all illegals in all entry points. Illegal crossings have been steadily dropping in the last 10 yrs. Most illegals came here legally and different leave per INS
@Pcjeffmac @RepMarkMeadows Oh and when they did sit down and he didn't get his way he acted exactly the way my 3 yr old does when he is told he can't have a cookie. Stormed off and pouted.
@Pcjeffmac @RepMarkMeadows That is your opinion and perception of things. What I heard from his own lips is he would only talk to them if they wanted to concede on the wall. He has said many times he would never sit down where that is not approved. That isn't comprimise, that is dictatorship.
@motocoaster @ScottRogers_WV @MyWVTravels @maddow @washingtonpost @wvgazettemail @CCARRanson @StopRockwool They aren't going to suffer any of those diseases.  That is a knee jerk reaction to fear and not having the experience of living near smokestacks of this size and output.
@ScottRogers_WV @MyWVTravels @maddow @washingtonpost @wvgazettemail @CCARRanson @StopRockwool @motocoaster You are absolutely entitled to your opinion.  I have had life experiences that tell me this will not be the demon everyone has made it out to be and just offered that view.
@RepMarkMeadows It doesn't matter if it is such a small part of the budget.  It doesn't address the actual immigration issues we have. Senate pass 100-0, meaning bi-partisan agreement to fund government without the wall.  Immigration is a separate discussion and We The People should not be pawns
@100_Disable_vet That is a crime.

@MyWVTravels @ScottRogers_WV @maddow @washingtonpost @wvgazettemail @CCARRanson @StopRockwool @motocoaster While I feel that contracts weren't read as closely as they should have and the county is being saddled with some costs we shouldn't be, these smokestacks are not going to damage the view for 99% of the population and it will do less damage than all the cars.
pt 6. This is the most important part.  Remember who you work for.  This is not about you, it is about us.  Spend a day in the life with different types of constituents.  Most of you weren't even middle class, you had money. You can't do what is needed if you don't understand.
pt 6.  We want you to stop playing the party card.  Both sides are horrible about it.  Not a single one of you are 100% right.  We teach our children to compromise on the playground, most of you have forgotten that skill and bully those that cross party lines.  STOP IT!
pt. 5  We also want to see campaign finance reform.  The ban on Super Pacs and all donations must be public.  Term limits for both the houses of Congress.  No one should have a career as a politician.  Also, lobbyists banned from meeting with elected officials, period.
pt 4. We also want reform on gun control. Not removal of guns or bans on any type of guns, but things like licensing which includes a signed bill of health from mental health care professional that has to be renewed every 2 years like a drivers lic.
pt 3. We want resources to remove people that have overstayed their visa or stream line the process to allow them to stay if they are contributing members of society.
No one is saying we want illegal immigrants in the country, but we do want there to be reform on what happens today.  No one is saying let them all in, but we need to have resources that efficiently process the tired, the poor, and the huddled masses that need asylum.
@SenateDems @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats  Stop holding the people you work for hostage. Reopen the gov now and come up with real immigration solutions that do not include a band aid on a bullet wound. Stop blindly drinking party flavored kool-aid and do your jobs. https://t.co/IBxpgcHjB6
@MKGenest Not all pro wall are racist.  There are some very uneducated people who've been scared into believing that all crime in our country is from Mexico. Fear is a powerful leash that zaps rationality away and with enough conditioning, can make even the best make the worst decisions.
@SenCapito @POTUS The Senate put through the bills that the GOP controlled House voted on and approved to continue funding the government without funding the wall. We need all politicians to come with real solutions that don't involve a wall.  Stop backing the Emperor in his new suit.

@WalshFreedom I agree, we have to keep this up front because this has serious implications on current and future elections and the foundation of our Democracy in general.
@TestifyDVon That is a very handsome family.  Thanks for sharing!
@WalshFreedom pt 4. This is an extremely complex issue that is not going to be solved by a simple solution.  The wall isn't going to stop criminals, it will stop ppl in need of asylum or safety.   I agree they shouldn't be here illegally, but we have made it impossible for them to do it legal.
@WalshFreedom pt 3 people die in mass shootings, which are bad, but nothing like the violence faced by some areas daily. We ask why don't they fight to clean up their own street...could you clean up your street if the officers allowed the crimes to happen?
@WalshFreedom pt 2. ICE agents trained in human tragedy. I am a mom and it would take something pretty freaking horrible for me to endanger my child to move them to someplace that I don't know will even take me. We in America really haven't had tragedy. We have had a relatively low
@WalshFreedom I think that even anti-wall people aren't saying we want to let in a horde of assholes.  There are better ways to provide national security than a wall.  Immigration reform - especially seasonal work visas, more case workers for anyone requesting asylum,

@GavinNewsum @Brenro4 @BlazeOfTruth @RagingGayCons I haven't always lived in WV, but thanks for assuming
@BlazeOfTruth @Brenro4 @GavinNewsum @RagingGayCons Someone who takes a sound bite or a rumor and doesn't fact check while calling it gospel. Hell, the orig post is one large made up pile of shit. The kid Mollie's parent took in IS not killers son, but a LEGAL citizen whose Hispanic parents were ran out of town by assholes like u
@BlazeOfTruth @Brenro4 @GavinNewsum @RagingGayCons The average case to have an immigration attorney is over 10k. To pay a coyote to smuggle you across is less than $500
@BlazeOfTruth @Brenro4 @GavinNewsum @RagingGayCons Actually, I have worked with an immigration attorney. Actually the chances of getting a legal visa from Mexico or South America is about the same as you winning the lottery. You have to be a doctor or a lawyer in Mexico to even make the cut unless you seek asylum
@BlazeOfTruth @Brenro4 @GavinNewsum @RagingGayCons Most drugs and weapons come through ports and aboard planes.  Most human trafficking come from Asian countries and they come in  boats
@BlazeOfTruth @Brenro4 @GavinNewsum @RagingGayCons Most farming labor is from migrant workers,  most illegal. There are jobs at meat packaging plants that owners can't keep full with good old American labor. I agree they shouldn't be here illegally, we need to fix the system so they are able to come legally with screening
@jenniferKtweets @RagingGayCons Yeah, sorry, you are right. I got lost in the thread of who was responding to what.
@Brenro4 @BlazeOfTruth @GavinNewsum @RagingGayCons There are a lot of jobs that wouldn't get done at all if not for those illegals from the south. Right now more illegals are here on expired visas then through southern border. Why not cry for more enforcement of that instead of a fruitless physical monument of failure.
@jenniferKtweets @RagingGayCons But the truth is, you just grouped an innocent US citizen with a single individual that killed someone. Also, more people are here illegally from over staying visas than cross our southern border
@jenniferKtweets @RagingGayCons We need reform,  no one who is here to work should have to be here illegally,especially jobs that sit empty.
@jenniferKtweets @RagingGayCons The truth is, we wouldn't have food in stores from the US without illegal migrant workers because Americans are lazy.
@jenniferKtweets @RagingGayCons The child the Tibbetts took in is a legal US citizen. He is not Rivera's son, but the child of some who worked with him on the farm. Mollie's brother asked his parents to take him in when his parents fled town due to harassment because they are also from Mexico.
@truthoverhate @RagingGayCons You too!
@jenniferKtweets @RagingGayCons And before you get butthurt, my legal name is Jennifer too.
@jenniferKtweets @RagingGayCons No, what I am saying is that he killed 1, US Ken doll killed 4.  Immigration reform must happen, but can't say all illegals are killers. That is like saying all women named Jennifer are sluts because one got caught getting nailed under the bleachers in hs

@AnneWheaton Just because you were ok to have a gun 2 years ago doesn't mean you are ok to have a gun now.  People's situations change, much like the ability to drive a car.  And just like driving a car, someone that gets their lic but never drives is more dangerous than a drunk
@AnneWheaton I support any measure that starts with the mental health issue.  Suicide kills more than guns and is 100% preventable with proper care.  This would also eliminate a good portion of gun violence.  We should also have to do contin ed, including range time and re-cert like car lic.

@realmikecolter @CtznsOfHumanity #WeAllBleedRed
@fred_guttenberg I am a Democrat, but also a gun owner. I think that existing laws should be enforced, but instead of more gun control, a revamp of the mental health system so that individuals who have a mental illness can get help instead of this. Suicide kills more than all the guns combined.
@Cptnrwrpnts I am here if you need to talk.  I have attempted and I lost my fiancee to suicide.  You are so worth it and your story isn't finished.
@bratd2000 @TaoOfTweet @mmpadellan I can tell my 7 yr old nephew it is wrong to hate someone different than he is because they are different and he gets it.  He won't understand the nuances because different groups define this differently. To make change we need to dumb it down and get to the point. #WeAllBleedRed
@bratd2000 @TaoOfTweet @mmpadellan word...the point I was actually trying to make is that we spend so much time quantifying the language we use, racism, prejudice, etc, that we forget to actually talk about the hate itself and how to fix it.
@bratd2000 @TaoOfTweet @mmpadellan While it was illegal then and now, it has been almost 15 years ago it happened.  I let it go then because I was in my late 20's with a young child and alone. It also wasn't brought up for sympathy, but to give an example on a point I was trying to make.
@PILiberal2 @bratd2000 @mmpadellan Open communication, talking and listening, is the only way to get to the heart of the matter.  In truth, there are some things I don't get, but there are other things that while not exactly the same, I experienced too, so I get it. #WeAllBleedRed
@bratd2000 @TaoOfTweet @mmpadellan Which was kind of funny because I had gone to Goodwill to buy some dress clothes to build my wardrobe because I was starting to work in more professional environments and wore one of those outfits to my meeting because I was taught if it is important, you dress for it.
@bratd2000 @TaoOfTweet @mmpadellan Yes and no.  I did to someone at state labor office and was asked, "Are you sure you heard that or are you being racist because you didn't get the job and the manager was black?" Said, "I heard it." Was told I shouldn't cry racism since I appear to be a privileged white woman.

@TaoOfTweet @bratd2000 @mmpadellan When I am denied a job because in the interview I am told I am not a person of color and that is what they are looking for, it is racism not prejudice.
@bratd2000 @mmpadellan Not all saltine skinned people believe racism is dead. It is hard to start a meaningful discussion when all the colors in the box have those that instantly go to the "You can't understand" card. While not popular, any group to exclude anyone based on color is racism.

@Timeismc2 @MikieSherrill We need to address the mental health issue in this country before gun violence can be fixed.

@defazio_lou @Alyssa_Milano Actually, the NRA cares less about actual gun rights and more about the money they make off of dues. They use scare tactics to keep members the same way anti-gun people do to make people feel guns have no place.

@Alyssa_Milano I get you are into gun control, but instead of rehashing a no win argument, why not push for better mental health care in America? More people in the US die of suicide every year than the top 4 other causes. This is preventable. This would also reduce gun violence.

@petstarr @Accordionhans @NPR If that is what you choose to take away from that...sure why not.  enjoy your day
@petstarr @Accordionhans @NPR I am going to be honest, I have appreciated the fact that you and I have been able to be civil with each other.  It is refreshing that these types of conversations can happen in our day and age. I know we very much disagree, but things can only get better with open dialogue.
@petstarr @Accordionhans @NPR You have again shown how much you are relying on sound bites for your information.
@petstarr @Accordionhans @NPR Where you can and can not carry firearms is more limited than in other states, including all the neighboring states.  Inside Cook County (Chicago for the midwest impaired) there are very strict guidelines. I have a permit for IL, but can't carry in Chicago.
@petstarr @Accordionhans @NPR Actually, that is not completely true.  For rifles and shotguns, yes.  You have to have a federal background check for handguns, even in Southern Illinois (the whole state isn't Chicago).  Conceal and Carry is extremely strict in IL in comparison to the rest of the country
@petstarr @Accordionhans @NPR And even with all of those restrictions, even Norway had a horrible mass shooting that killed several children.
@petstarr @Accordionhans @NPR I am not though.  The difference isn't in the strictness of the laws, but the fact that the laws they have are strictly enforced.  That is really the difference.  We have a shit ton of laws on the books, but they are not enforced.
@petstarr @Accordionhans @NPR https://t.co/9qNBTdN0Uh	Where I will agree that more regs needs to happen is around gun show transactions. Right now, anybody can go to a gun show and walk out with a gun.  All transactions should have to undergo a background check.  But you still have the issue of reliability
@petstarr @Accordionhans @NPR To get a job doing firearm background checks, you only have to have a GED and be over 21.  You get 2 weeks of training and just pull data from a database you hope is up to date.  Oh and you have 30 days or the app is automatically approved. In the US,
@petstarr @Accordionhans @NPR Mental health employees have more formal education than military personnel, police officers, first responders.  I don't know about you, but I think someone with a GED reading a print out is more qualified to assess if someone should or shouldn't have a gun.
@petstarr @Accordionhans @NPR They are actually more qualified than the government employees that do background checks to determine if someone should or should not have a fire arm.  Just think if these individuals were under professional care, they could have been stopped.
@petstarr @Accordionhans @NPR It isn't though. They are professionals that are mandatory reporters if they believe their patient is a harm to themselves or others.  They are the first line of defense against senseless tragedies committed by someone with mental issues.
I am not saying shootings aren't horrible, they are, but death by guns don't crack the top 10 causes of death in the US. Instead of gun control, let's talk about fixing mental health care access and stigmas.  Suicide is 10 and preventable., https://t.co/l02yRo45Dw
@petstarr @Accordionhans @NPR And these incidents are horrible and scary, but gun violence doesn't even crack the top 10 in causes of death in the US.  Suicide is number 10 and while some are by gun, they can all be prevented by mental health reform https://t.co/l02yRo45Dw
@petstarr @Accordionhans @NPR While overall numbers, the US has the highest death rate by guns in sheer volume, per capita, we are pretty middle of the road.  By saying this, I am NOT saying let disturbed people have guns and shoot up clubs or schools. Mental health care could have stopped many attacks
@petstarr @Accordionhans @NPR Sorry, the url for that wouldn't fit https://t.co/2pQ5JYs31Z
@petstarr @Accordionhans @NPR You can't even blame the fact that 1/3 of American adults have guns as the reason for the higher gun violence.  From a news article "On the other hand, Norway, Finland, Germany, France and Denmark, all countries with heavy gun ownership, have a history of low murder rates."
@petstarr @Accordionhans @NPR https://t.co/95r7Bfzh0j		States with some of the lowest firearm ownership rates have some of the highest murder by gun rates
@petstarr @Accordionhans @NPR https://t.co/VEXN0uYhj2		Illnois has some of the toughest gun laws and yet, still is in the top 10% of homicide rates.
@petstarr @Accordionhans @NPR If you can't understand why going after mental health would be a better approach than the same song and dance we have done for every mass shooting since Columbine, then you are right, there is no point in continuing this conversation. Especially since you don't have skin in it.
@petstarr @Accordionhans @NPR I have never said pass out guns for Halloween, but this is not a black and white issue here. For anyone to say it is doesn't have a full understanding of American history or is a Politician trying to blow smoke to get votes.
@petstarr @Accordionhans @NPR While that seems worse case...jave you seen our racist, sexist President who is already using precedent to deny rights to citizens and individuals here legally
@petstarr @Accordionhans @NPR The other issue with gun bans in the US is the slippery slope it will create with our Constutution. We have the right to have fire arms under the 2nd Amend. If this right I removed, then the same arguments could be used to remove women's right to vote and blacks as citizens
@petstarr @Accordionhans @NPR You don't actually know what the current gun laws are and yet you are behaving like an expert. This is one of the many issues with the gun debate in America...ignorance and half baked opinions not based in reality or truth.
@petstarr @Accordionhans @NPR You are purposely being obtuse. Most people in the US don't actually know what the current gun laws are. They hear 30 second sound bites after a tragedy and don't bother to educate themselves. We don't need new laws, just enforcement all the MANY existing laws.
@petstarr @Accordionhans It is apparent you do not fully understand the laws and rules already in place for gun ownership and the acquisition of ammo to go with it. Again, not everyone should have a gun, but the arguments you have presented do not have real world application
@petstarr @Accordionhans And if someone plays with building pipe bombs, much like your argument with having guns and target shooting, they have the materials on hand and the know how. It doesn't take any more time than planning on going somewhere, staking out the place, ensuring you have enough ammo
@petstarr @Accordionhans Oh and you can't buy a gun and ammunition for a gun on the same day.
@petstarr @Accordionhans In 2016 man murdered 19 and injured 26 with a knife in Japan, so this argument holds no weight
@petstarr @Accordionhans The only gun you can just buy are regular rifles and shotguns. The type of guns being used in these mass killings already have a background check required
@skieval3359 @Accordionhans @petstarr Mentally ill people can kill without guns. If someone is deep in a manic or a Schitz episode or ptsd moment where people are no longer people, they will still kill, usually more physically  violent and depending, slow and painful deaths.
@mccaffriedion @Accordionhans Again, I don't think that everyone should have access to a gun. I own a gun and where I live, I would still qualify to have the firearms I do under most European nations.  The truth is gun laws don't work. Time and time again this has been proven true. We need a diff tactic
@mccaffriedion @Accordionhans While this is true, in situations like this people automatically go to gun bans. Not all gun owners are criminals AND it gets us no where. That is actually why I recommend a different approach. Maybe progress could finally be made.
@petstarr @Accordionhans That is the point you are ignoring
@petstarr @Accordionhans And how many have died in bombs, which can be made with common household chemicals and a little bit of googling. I am not naive, but gun laws aren't the answer. Chicago has some of the toughest laws in the country and some of the highest death by gun statistics.
@petstarr @Accordionhans Pull the weed without the roots, it just grows back slightly different, but still a weed
@petstarr @Accordionhans The truth is, regulate guns into extinction without mental health reform and they will move to bombs, poisons, knife attacks, vehicular homicide, etc. Should everyone own a gun, fuck no, but they are not the root of the problem
@petstarr @Accordionhans I can tell u have never bought a gun. There are already bg checks in place.. However the law states that regardless if your application has been touched, in 30 days ur approved unless something is found.  It isn't a lack of laws that are the issue, it is lack of people 2 enforce.
@petstarr @Accordionhans The other issue with more gun control versus mental health reform is it doesn't address the actual root cause of the mass killing issue. The gun is just the tool used to kill, not the source of the urge, regardless if it is mania, schitz, ptsd, or extreme narcassism
@skieval3359 @Accordionhans @petstarr Actually, that is not what I am saying. There are tons of laws that already can't be enforced due to manpower issues. Instead of another useless measure, address the other commonality amongst all the mass shooters, which is mental illness. This would actually make a difference
@Accordionhans @skieval3359 @petstarr Bit that person had a mental illness. Saying guns are bad because they killed people vs protection or hunting is like saying cars are bad because a women killed 3 kids not atooing for a bus.
@petstarr @Accordionhans There are background checks. The issue is because treatment is hard to come by and the social stigma, people don't seek help. If it is unreported a background check isn't going to do squat. There is also the issue if the diagnosis comes after the gun purchase, they keep the guns
@Accordionhans I don't think we need gun control.  We need mental health reform.  All the shooters have had mental illnesses. If you have a mental illness, it is hard to get treatment in this country. There is also a large negative stigma if you are confirmed to have a mental illness.
@NancyPelosi @HouseDemocrats WE don't need gun control. We need a real conversation on mental health care. While someone pulled a trigger, the hand was connected to a very ill brain.  All mass shootings have had someone with a mental illness commit them.  #MentalHealthChange
@SenSanders Senator Sanders, a lot of people will preach gun control, but the other constant in these tragedies is mental illness.  Instead of guns, engage in health care reforms for those whose illness can wreck havoc on the population around them when they are at their sickest.
@GeorgeTakei I think instead of gun control it should be revamping the mental health care system. All mass shooters have had mental health issues that were known

@RealDLHughley There is a difference.  They are in different places in the justice system AND there is a big difference: 1 is a mouthy/handsy douche bag and the other choose to put a drug in a drink and a penis in a passed out pussy.
@ThatKevinSmith I am so proud of you.  Having done my own weight lose journey (over 100 lb) I know that this is not easy.  Keep up the excellent work and even though we don't know each other irl, know you have a weight loss buddy in me.

@SenJohnMcCain @SpeakerRyan I am a moderate and have a lot of respect for you Senator McCain, but saying Speaker Ryan was a leader of any positive merit makes me question if you truly are the man I have respected or another talking head clone regurgitating what he is told for the party.
@ShinobiNinja I have to say I am in LOVE with the vibe of the video, especially the kid at the beginning of the video. It made me, as a first time listener to you, feel like we had been kicking it a long time and you were my go to jam.  The song was also great. Makes me want to listen to more.

You don't realize how old you are until you are out digging up your garden and humming your favorite song and realize if that song were a person, it could legally buy you a drink.
@xenonbrawler That is so true

@NyleDiMarco That show is my guilty pleasure too. I was afraid they wouldn't do a season 2.
2 Yr Old must have known this was the last day to destroy everything without the big kids interfering. Pulling him out of the fridge 18 times, watched him velociraptor the fence, &amp; chuck the dog's water dish far enough to make an NFL quarterback proud. #ToddlerTerrorist https://t.co/TKlJoosL6W

@BuzzFeed I love this show because I have lived in a neighborhood much like this one as a young adult.  It is so multidimensional that it makes you think on so many levels.
@ericarhodes Joke because he could be looking to get rich from selling the song, but you have to really have meant something for him to make money on a joke.
I think Mother Nature was still drink from St. Patrick's day Monday night. Woke up to this on the first day of Spring. https://t.co/KbuhZfpT4o
@GeekAaron Well and when you have overnight travel on a plane or train. Before I would force myself to stay awake so I didn't disturb anyone else. Now I just pop it in and snooze. I will say though, you do get death breath from it
@GeekAaron Usually the consultation is free. I did have to fight with my insurance to cover it because it is done at a dentist's office, but they paid about as much as they had for my CPAP. I will say if they offer to make you a back up, do it. I use one at home and travel with the other

@kellengoff Congrats
@wilw The bigger question that should be asked...where were their parents during all of this and why were they not contacted by the school for them ditching class before punishment was given.
@wilw While I don't believe that corporal punishment was right in this case, these are minors and there are laws saying they should be in school. Of there parents pulled them out, the school couldn't have done anything to them, but they made choices they did not legally have.
@jolly1766 @wilw Actually spanking is not illegal in any state. There are rules governing it, but it is perfectly legal and more people should use it as a means of discipline when time outs and talking don't work.
@wilw Actually, I firmly believe in corporal punishment. There is a reason that kids feel entitled to act like complete asshats in school. Parents aren't parents and no consequences that make them think twice

@Ojeda4congress #StrongWomen need to be more than islands that swim upstream and carve paths.  If you are elected @Ojeda4congress , what will you do to support female politicians, even if it goes against your personal agenda?
@Ojeda4congress Then let's add the Old Boys Club that push strong women out of committees or worse, bring them in as token females with no intention of letting their voice be heard so they don't get on a committee that could interfere with their special interest.
@Ojeda4congress Women are even worse.  Anytime a female politician shows up to an event or speaks, it isn't what they are saying that is talked about, it is what they are wearing or the make-up they have on.
@Ojeda4congress It is true, more of us should step up and join politics, but quite honestly, what is in it for us?  If we are passionate, we are aggressive bitches or worse we are sex shamed for it...and that is just the men.
Irony...when you look forward to travelling for work to have a break from the kids, but realize clocks move forward an hour so you don't get as much time away as you thought. bwhahaha #MommyProblems
@WVGovernor @foxandfriends And since teachers and citizens have been screaming at you and your peers to do your job, NOW education is your focus.  Enjoy your job while you still have it.  Keep your lip service to yourself, we are all smarter than that.  #OutInNovember #DoYourJob #WVTeachers
@WVGovernor @foxandfriends You are just covering your soon to be ousted backside by dropping the flag half mast for a man who did not earn it.  You insult our veterans and heads of state that dedicated their lives to the freedoms of America, not endanger a group through hate and prejudice.
@WVGovernor @foxandfriends If education is so important to you, why did it take them banding with other State employees and striking for you to get off your booha and do something prior?  Oh wait...teachers and education didn't meant dick to you until the people started knocking on your door en mass
@MichaelCPB1 @WVGovernor @SueSuebarker12 @foxandfriends You obviously know nothing about what you are talking about.  Every state is different. WV is more efficient in most in the fact that every county is a district instead of every few towns. Teachers in WV hadn't had a raise in 6 years.
@dali_popp Don't let anyone stop you for being you. If they want to drink hater-aid, be a lady, hand them a straw and watch them choke on it. You are amazing.

@BaileyJ1516 @wvsenate You realize we just gave the politicians a class in how to find common ground. We don't have to agree on everything, but if we have a stone to stand on, we can build anything. Take note @wvhouse @wvsenate @WVGovernor @WVGOP @wvdemocrats
@BaileyJ1516 @wvsenate And for the record, we all pay a special tax that should be going into the medicade fund and not raided. If they are touching that over their party and sandwich budget, shame on them
@BaileyJ1516 @wvsenate But that is it, you make good money and you aren't expected to buy meds and supplies for your patients. I have friends that are teachers. Because parents are lower income they can't ask for more supplies and pay for the out of pocket so no one is left out. Vicious cycle
@BaileyJ1516 @wvsenate And I am all for financial stability. I also realize, like in business it takes education to produce results. You can't pooch the future and hope they move out of state and come back with skills to make the state better. At that point it is too late.
@BaileyJ1516 @wvsenate I have never worked for a private sector company, including McDonalds in High School that I did not get at least a 1% annual raise. If you aren't getting a raise, you should rethink your life choices
@BaileyJ1516 @wvsenate Look at the budget like I did, you would see politicians gave raises to them and thiers during the same time. There is also a lot of special interest spending that could get cut. Roll back politician salaries to 6 years ago, 2 term limits, no pension for politicians. #paidFor
@BaileyJ1516 @wvsenate They aren't asking for the moon. Quite honestly I am going to guess if they got the standard private sector 1-3% raise annually, this would not have been an issue.
@BaileyJ1516 @wvsenate Who works in the private sector and keeps the same job not getting a raise in 6 years? Who in the private sector is legally required to take the insurance offered and not look for other options? Grow up. Our gov did not do our kids justice by fucking our educators.
@BaileyJ1516 @wvsenate Stop blaming the teachers for blatent mismanaged resources for years by both parties. How about holding politicians accountable and voting in all new people in November?
@wvsenate You should roll back your salaries, set term limits and eliminate your pensions. You would then have money for this raise without impacting the vulnerable. #DoYourJob
A rescued beagle, a toddler, and two school age children walked into a living room...		the punchline - no punchline, no laughing...this is my life while the teachers are taking care of business.   #55Strong #55United

@TitusNation Oh and you are funny as fuck.  I am a lifetime fan.
@DeplrableJulius @TitusNation Broken homes aren't the issue. Those have been around in one form or another since the 40's.  It is accountability and the fact we have raised children with a victim mentality.  We have failed giving them coping mechanisms when things go sideways.
@TitusNation I graduated school in the 90's. During hunting season, there were shotguns locked on gun racks in the back of most pick up trucks.  No one was shot. No one was threatened.  You know why, an adult would have kicked their ass.  Today there is no accountability. never their fault
@TitusNation You know, while this will not be popular, this is less of a gun issue and more of a society issue. Parent want to be friends, not parents. We tell every kid they are special. We let kids believe there are no winners or losers.  How can a kid hope to cope with disappointment?

@SenatorKarnes You do realize, the kids in school today will be running the home you go to when you are old, right?  You and your peers stopped them from having a decent education, from being able to compete with children across the country, let alone the world. #DoYourJob #55Strong #55United
@SenatorKarnes @SEnatorKarnes  The teachers were promised something and now you and your peers are damaging our children's future for not nutting up and doing your job.  Pass the bill, give them what was negotiated, get our kids back in school. #55Strong #55United #DoYourJob

@wvsenate @wvhouse @WVGovernor @wvgov @wvlegislature   To my fellow constituents, it is time to send a very clear message to our leaders who have failed us and more importantly have failed our children.  NO MORE GOING WITH THE KNOWN EVIL THAN THE ONE YOU DON'T. #YouWorkForUs https://t.co/o4LztRKTKv

@DWJCowboydad4 @WVGovernor We will agree to disagree on his contribution to anything positive in this country.

@WVGovernor Teachers should not go back without something passed through both chambers and signed on your desk.  They are educators, not morons and if they go back without that, you and your peers can and will screw them over because they lose bargaining power.
@WVGovernor You and all of your peers should resign after the way you have mishandled state employees.  If you were a CEO, you would be asked to resign with a vote of no confidence.
