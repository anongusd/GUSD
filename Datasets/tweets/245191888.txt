How do you fund public infrastructure via the private sector without first privatizing and deregulating these sectors to allow for private participation or the implementation of sound PPP regulatory frameworks.
@patrickkwabena @DWteVelde True
@DWteVelde My point exactly regarding all the hue and cry on the nature of Chinese loans to Africa. Ultimately the onus lies on Africa to use and even negotiate better loan deals not just with China but even with the multilateral institutions as well.
