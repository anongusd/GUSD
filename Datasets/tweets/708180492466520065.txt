@BuddShenkin @saknussemmocean @Joshua4Congress @Kalista63 @ninaturner @TulsiGabbard @IlhanMN @KamalaHarris Sure, but we could such a situation altogether by just nominating a strong candidate in the first place.
@BuddShenkin @saknussemmocean @Joshua4Congress @Kalista63 @ninaturner @TulsiGabbard @IlhanMN @KamalaHarris Hillary Clinton helped elect Trump. The overwhelming share of the blame goes to her.

@MelissaAmour72 @burkejosephp I don't see how on he's on the "far left" of mainstream political opinion when his views are objectively the most mainstream out of anyone. 		And no, I don't accept the title, because it implies that basic common sense policies most people support are somehow extremist.
@MelissaAmour72 @burkejosephp Yes, if Americans were actually informed and educated about Medicare For All, support would be in the 90s.
@MelissaAmour72 @burkejosephp I didn't say it was a mainstream political position, I said it was the far-left political position.
@MelissaAmour72 @burkejosephp I don't see how you get to that conclusion. You can argue that specific policies are popular because Americans are uninformed, but that doesn't change the fact that they're popular.

@MelissaAmour72 @burkejosephp Well I don't know what your definition of moderate is, but my definition is someone that aligns with the majority of Americans on key policy issues. And I think that's a pretty fair definition.
@burkejosephp @MelissaAmour72 This is such a tired and dumb talking point. The polls in 2016 had Clinton beating Trump in the popular vote by an average of about three points. She ended up beating him by about two. That's a difference of a single point. They were remarkably accurate. https://t.co/ZvG9bcbVHe
@burkejosephp @MelissaAmour72 @realDonaldTrump We tried your strategy of nominating a "moderate" in 2016 and we lost.

He's our best chance. https://t.co/YAEcK1yZKh

@MelissaAmour72 @burkejosephp I linked the article because it contains polling data that shows his policies have majority support.

@Kittenman234 If it’s between him and Trump, then yes, they will vote for him.		And if 77% favorability among African Americans is “very bad” for a Democratic candidate, then I’ve got some bad news about your buddy Joe Biden, whose favorability is also in the 70s.
@Kittenman234 This is incorrect. Bernie has support from both independents and minorities as well. And he has a unique  ability to inspire and mobilize people that Biden lacks.
@Kittenman234 With Bernie in office, he’ll be able to mobilize tons of people to fight to get a progressive Congress elected. Even if he doesn’t get it done, I’d rather have a president that fights for the right things and fails than one that doesn’t try at all.
@Kittenman234 Because Bernie’s an active politician and Biden’s not. Once Biden actually enters the race and starts yapping his mouth, his poll numbers will immediately drop.
@Kittenman234 You keep asserting that Bernie has no shot as if it’s a fact - when in reality all the data shows the opposite. It’s getting silly now.		And no, we finally have a chance to move this country into a bold, progressive direction. We shouldn’t squander that opportunity with Biden.
@Kittenman234 Bernie has been advocating for the same progressive policies for decades now. The other candidates, save for Warren, only adopted them in 2017.
@Kittenman234 Here, I’ll answer that for you: You can’t. In fact, to the extent that recent polling has been done, it shows much of the same results from 2016. https://t.co/kY6rxG8a2A
@Kittenman234 There’s no reason to believe any of these numbers have changed significantly. Can you cite recent polling showing that Sanders would lose to Trump in these key states? Otherwise your assertion is utterly baseless.
@James_Hovland @hansalexrazo Well I still get paid regardless of how they respond to my message, so I don’t really mind either way.
@James_Hovland @hansalexrazo Keep responding James, you’re making me a lot of money! 💰
@James_Hovland @hansalexrazo Sure. Depending on who you ask, I’m either on the payroll of George Soros or the Kremlin.
@James_Hovland @hansalexrazo It’s not naive at all. Only a cultist would assume that constructive criticism of a candidate makes you “the opposition”.
@James_Hovland @hansalexrazo If you’re calling someone a neoliberal shill because of them criticizing Bernie *from the left*, then quite frankly, you’re an idiot.
@JewishWorker @tappylappy What do you think he should’ve done instead?
@James_Hovland @hansalexrazo Being critical of Gillibrand, Booker, and Harris got them to stop accepting corporate PAC money.
@James_Hovland @hansalexrazo What’s naive is saying that politicians shouldn’t be criticized. Pressuring politicians has shown to be a very effective strategy. If you don’t call them out when they do something wrong, you’re essentially giving them a greenlight to continue that wrong behavior.
@James_Hovland @hansalexrazo This is just objectively incorrect.
@Kittenman234 It’s not being “realistic” - it’s being ignorant.		Sanders doesn’t just lead Trump in the national polls. He also leads Trump in the specific states that cost Clinton the election - and by wide margins too. https://t.co/tIfhMx32tn
@Kittenman234 1. The majority of voters have a positive opinion of him and he leads Trump in virtually every poll.	2. Biden is the exact opposite of what we need right now.	3. What distinguishes him from others is that he has an actual track record of fighting for those things - and his FP.
@Kittenman234 I’m well aware that they’re two different things. Bernie holds both titles.		And Bernie has one of the highest approval ratings among Democrats out of all the declared primary candidates. It is only a small minority that dislikes him.		https://t.co/EpM43lriXa

@James_Hovland @hansalexrazo It's thanks to progressive pressure and the reemergence of the left-wing anti-war movement that Bernie went from saying stay in 2015 and is now in 2019 saying we should withdraw.
@James_Hovland @hansalexrazo Seems like you're the one that's new here. Bernie used to be significantly more anti-imperialist back when he was younger. Ever since joining Washington, he's begun to toe the establishment line more. He went from "abolish the CIA" to "keep troops in Afganistan".

@CircleIsPurple It is true that they are more conservative than Latinos nationally. I suppose we'll see. Either way it will be very close.
@CircleIsPurple Sanders has a very high approval rating among Latinos.
@CircleIsPurple That didn't stop him from leading in the 2016 polls. Should also be noted that recent polls show Trump's approval rating underwater in Florida. We'll see. I think Florida goes to Sanders. 		https://t.co/076twpYoRs
@CircleIsPurple Saying that there's "no way" Sanders could win Florida is pretty naive. The governor race was *extremely* close, and voting rights have since been restored to 1.4 million more people. A Sanders victory is definitely in the realm of possibility.
@CircleIsPurple This is the most recent polling on Florida that's available. While it's *possible* that Trump will win Florida, more likely than not it'll go to Sanders.

@MelissaAmour72 Did using the nuclear option really come back to bite the Dems in the end though? That’s the conventional wisdom, but let’s be real - McConnel probably would’ve used it to force through Gorsuch regardless of whether Reid did it or not.
@MelissaAmour72 @DalyPolitics The best way to get an actual viable third party would be to push Congress/states to pass ranked-choice-voting.
@MelissaAmour72 Don't think this is really comparable to what Harry Reid did with the nuclear option. All that did was lower the threshold of votes required to get judges through. This would massively expand the power of the executive branch, with virtually no input from Congress whatsoever.
@MelissaAmour72 @DalyPolitics The thing about forming a third party is that it's very difficult for them to in the system we have right now. Even in an election where the two major party candidates were historically unpopular, Jill Stein and Gary Johnson combined got less than 5% of the vote.

AIPAC is an extremely powerful lobbying organization that actively advocates for the oppression and murder of Palestinians. If your response to a Muslim woman calling them out is to call her or her remarks anti-semitic, you're engaging in anti-Arab racism. Simple as that.

@Delray881 @Brensweets If Shapiro is so well aware of the impact of discrimination and racism, why does he have no problem perpetuating and supporting it? He's written in favor of the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians and actively advocates for state-sanctioned discrimination against LGBT+ people.
@Delray881 @Brensweets You better tell that to Ben Shapiro then, who calls anyone that dares to make even the most tepid, mild criticism of Israel anti-semitic. Like Nathan said, he's a bad faith actor.		Don't see why AOC or any progressive should be expected to engage with a blatant smear merchant.
@Delray881 @Brensweets Pointing out Shapiro's own words isn't cherrypicking.
@Delray881 @Brensweets Here comes the typical right-wing double standards. Ilhan Omar says the Israeli lobby has powerful influence over U.S. politics (an objective fact), and she's a raging anti-semite! Ben Shapiro says that "Arabs like to bomb crap", and he's not bigoted at all!
@Delray881 @Brensweets I'd be interested in hearing exactly what context you think saying "Arabs like to bomb crap and live in open sewage" is an acceptable thing to say.

@moduscheetotus @VeeDub7777 @MitchellCares @nytopinion @nytdavidbrooks Sanders consistently polls as one of the best Democratic candidates against Trump. He’s the most progressive, willing to challenge the establishment, and has been very consistent in his positions. The same can’t be said for many of the other candidates, who shifted left recently. https://t.co/tMsxykYDDZ
@moduscheetotus @VeeDub7777 @MitchellCares @nytopinion @nytdavidbrooks I have my doubts about Warren, but I think Sanders would crush Trump easily. Trump is scared of him. That’s why he backed out of the debate in 2016.

@trump_troll_16 Perhaps because the people who bring this up don’t actually care about the women affected, but rather just smearing Sanders. It’s sick that the anti-Bernie crowd has decided to politicize the issue of sexual harassment simply because they don’t want poor people to get healthcare.
@trump_troll_16 Also, Sanders didn’t “ignore” it. He didn’t even know about it. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, did and actively chose to shield a top aide accused of sexual harassment. Why is that never brought up? All we ever hear about is Sanders.
@trump_troll_16 He has a net favorability of +15. And he consistently performs better against Trump than virtually all of the other Democratic candidates. Biden’s polling will tank once his right-wing record is exposed on the debate stage.
Except they do.		70% of Americans support Medicare For All.		59% support allowing abortion in all or most cases.		62% support banning assault weapons.		81% support a Green New Deal.		If we’re crazy for espousing these ideals, so are most Americans. https://t.co/rPelrUT5a5
@JohnathonWillow Supporting policies that the rest of the developed world already has isn’t “radical”.
@trump_troll_16 Recent polls affirm the same thing. Here’s one from September 2018 that shows the majority of Americans approve of Sanders. Not to mention that literally every poll that’s been conducted on 2020 has him beating Trump. And to call him sexist is ridiculous		https://t.co/BNU5MOhgge

@MelissaAmour72 Who is defending Maduro?
@GayLabourYorkie People often say “oh, the Democrats can’t run on abolishing ICE because it doesn’t poll well!”. In reality, if the Democrats actually fought and make the case for it, abolishing ICE would already have majority support.
This is interesting - a plurality of swing state Democratic primary voters say a candidate coming out in favor of abolishing ICE would make them more likely to vote for them. https://t.co/J6vKADYyDJ

@GoodKidNapCity @BethLynch2020 It's not about him disagreeing with Putin on a few policies. It's about the vast bulk of his policies being anti-Russia. Like I said, Trump's policies on Russia are far harsher than Obama's were. That's just the reality.
@GoodKidNapCity @BethLynch2020 And I say this as someone that likes Cenk/TYT. But he's way off-base on this issue.

@Technomaton @BethLynch2020 @SenSanders It's not about an "old white dude" being the face of the future, it's about a bold progressive being the face of the future. Policy is what matters in a candidate, not identity. Anyone who Wall Street is comfortable with is unqualified to lead the Democratic Party.
@Technomaton @BethLynch2020 Oh sure, it was just a coincidence that the other candidates only came out in favor of Medicare For All after it was popularized by the Sanders campaign. It had *NOTHING* to do with Sanders at all. That's definitely what happened here.
@Technomaton @BethLynch2020 As for Castro, one of the policies he's campaigning on is Medicare For All. Has he ever said *anything* in support of that policy prior to Bernie's 2016 run? You tell me.
@Technomaton @BethLynch2020 It's not giving him credit for his age, it's giving him credit for his track record. Sanders didn't invent Medicare For All, but he definitely popularized it - and it's only because of him that the other candidates have jumped on board. That's just the reality.
@philosophrob He still supports sanctions on Russia though.
@Technomaton @BethLynch2020 day #1. They've supported it since 2017. Why choose an imitation when the real thing is on the menu?		Not only that - he also has the most progressive foreign policy. He's by far the most willing to challenge U.S. exceptionalism + imperialism, &amp; is also the most pro-Palestinian.
@Technomaton @BethLynch2020 I think you're *way* off-base with the claim that he has nothing unique to offer. Sanders comes with the unique status of being a leader. The other candidates are followers. The only reason they've endorsed Medicare For All is because he popularized it. He's supported it since
@Technomaton @BethLynch2020 Yes, of course it’s still early and a whole host of things can change. My point was that it’s incorrect to suggest he does poorly with people of color. That’s a myth.

@Cox_Box_Tornado @indiemusicfan0 @awjedwards @23socialism23 @EoinHiggins_ Yep.

@indiemusicfan0 @awjedwards @Cox_Box_Tornado @23socialism23 @EoinHiggins_ Not only is Gillibrand anti-BDS as well, but in fact she also originally signed onto the anti-BDS bill.

Also, Jill Stein ran as a third-party candidate for president, and you guys trashed her anyway! When progressives run within the Democratic Party, they're gaming the system. When running within a third party, they're splitting the vote. There's no winning with you people.
No, the Democrats (along with the Republicans) gamed the system by making it so that independents/third-party candidates get no coverage and aren't allowed in the debates. 		https://t.co/f0wGoXanTX

@QueenInYeIIow I like how he says “America doesn’t want socialism - they want specific social programs like M4A”. Specific programs like M4A are exactly what Bernie’s campaigning on - he’s not campaigning on “socialism”. 		And Bernie is more aggressive at pushing for M4A than Warren anyway.

While both him and Warren are good candidates, Bernie is clearly the most progressive, as well as the most electable. We need to unite behind him in 2020.
In defense of Warren voting for the defense bill, Dean says that "every Democrat except for Bernie voted for that defense bill". That's true, and is just another example of how Bernie is better on foreign policy than Warren and the other Democrats. 		https://t.co/SaHoQYaaBX
Sanders sets himself in a crucial way from Warren and other (potential) 2020 contenders in that he's by far the most critical of Israel. Sanders has raised the possibility of reducing military aid to Israel - Warren hasn't.		https://t.co/qNObQ20MCf
"Warren goes easier on America’s allies. In his Johns Hopkins speech, Sanders chastised Saudi Arabia by name 13 times. Warren mentions it only three times. Sanders devoted a paragraph to rising authoritarianism in Israel, something Warren ignores." https://t.co/nmn7tPg74o
"For Warren, American foreign policy only started going wrong in the 1980s. It’s another sign that Warren is less interested than Sanders in challenging American exceptionalism, less interested in looking at the dark side of America’s history as a superpower." https://t.co/EUX1IyQkVc
"Unlike Sanders, she doesn’t challenge the narrative of a virtuous cold war in which America rose to superpower status while at the same time spreading liberty and prosperity. She embraces it. " https://t.co/ex8Xfy4rRI
This piece does a good job shining some light on the differences between Sanders and Warren on foreign policy. As it notes: "Warren’s vision is more conventional; Bernie Sanders’s is more radical."		https://t.co/2XdNBUnuiG
Now, there is no doubt that Warren's foreign policy would be a marked improvement compared to previous presidents, and poses a threat to the military-industrial-complex. But Sanders is much more willing to challenge the notion of American exceptionalism, which is very important.
Those "Bernie-adjacent commentators" are absolutely right. While both Sanders and Warren are somewhat weak on foreign policy, Sanders is absolutely the stronger of the two when it comes to the issue - and anyone that asserts otherwise is being silly. https://t.co/D0hxuaGOtg
@theminorchords So preferring Bernie over Warren makes you a cultist now? That's absolutely ridiculous. I like both of them, and would enthusiastically support Warren if he decides not to run, but right now he's my first choice for the primary.
@SuicideByWords @pinkynthebrian It's not debatable. He has. Call the other things I brought up "allegations" if you wish, but the Syria strikes and the coalition with Saudi Arabia in the Yemen War are documented facts and are objectively in violation of both U.S. and international law.
@SuicideByWords @pinkynthebrian The ACLU didn't say that. You are confusing the ACLU with the ADL.
@SuicideByWords @pinkynthebrian you need authorization from Congress. The Syria strikes didn't get either - thus violating both international and U.S. law. 	4. That it happened under the Obama Administration as well doesn't change the fact that it's a crime. 	5. It's not an "allegation" - it's a documented fact
@SuicideByWords @pinkynthebrian 1. The NYT article goes extremely in depth and provides documents to back up everything they say.	2. It's the conclusion of federal prosecutors.	3. Under international law, you need UN authorization to attack another country for reasons other than self-defense. Under U.S. law,

@wayoffbroadwayy Ideologically, I am more aligned with a negative income tax than universal basic income, but I suspect that UBI may be more politically feasible. I think there would probably be less resistance to the program if it's universal rather than just given to poor people.
@wayoffbroadwayy We need to eradicate poverty. Not just reduce it. Completely eliminate it. I don't think that people should be homeless just because they choose not to work. I think that quite frankly it's cruel, inhumane, barbaric, and disgusting. A civilized society should not have that.
@wayoffbroadwayy Yes, that's what UBI is. It's called *universal* basic income for a reason.		Well, as someone who does unironically support UBI, let me tell you why. Call me a bleeding heart, but I think everyone should be entitled to have enough money to afford the basic necessities as a right.
@wayoffbroadwayy In addition to raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, he also wants to expand Social Security and Medicare.
@wayoffbroadwayy He is still anti-open borders, though I wouldn't necessarily call him pro-ICE. He just supports reforming the agency rather than abolishing it.
RT @HumanistReport: “Her policies are insane” - Iraq war supporter https://t.co/fbRu4TCjww
@wayoffbroadwayy He wants the $15 minimum wage *in addition* to welfare, not as a replacement for it.		And that policy is very different from UBI. A $15 minimum wage applies to workers only. UBI would apply to *everyone*, regardless of whether they work or not.
@wayoffbroadwayy Bernie wants to bring immigrants that have already been deported back to the country if they have relatives that live here). Doesn't sound like a "hardcore restrictionist" to me. 		https://t.co/biqhkUkDaM
@wayoffbroadwayy Even on the campaign trail, his rhetoric was only non-interventionist half the time. The other half, he was a gigantic warmonger that openly endorsed terrorism.
@wayoffbroadwayy Whether he actually has a principled belief in the stuff he's doing is quite frankly irrelevant. What matters is that he's doing it.
@wayoffbroadwayy He hasn't come out against the idea, but he hasn't come out for it either.

@wayoffbroadwayy Would President Sanders have appointed the richest cabinet in modern history? Withdrawn from the Paris Climate Agreement? Rescinded DACA? Cut taxes for the rich? Deregulated Wall Street? Continued selling weapons to Saudi Arabia? Withdrawn from the Iran Deal? Etc? Absolutely not.
@wayoffbroadwayy 10. Trump doesn't support expanding Social Security - he supports cutting it. 	11. For different things.	12. "Attitude" doesn't mean anything. What matters is policy, where they are *markedly* different.
@wayoffbroadwayy 8. Sure, but worth noting that their plans for doing so differ significantly.	9. Bernie doesn't support "the severe reduction of immigration". He supports looser immigration laws, which in direct contrast to Trump who favors stricter ones.
@wayoffbroadwayy 4. Trump is more of a supply-sider than a Keynesian.	5. All politicians are "nationalists" in some form or another.	6. Don't see why you listed this twice.	7. Are there any politicians that *don't* support job creation?
@wayoffbroadwayy 1. Sure.	2. Trump isn't a non-interventionist. He increased drone strikes by 432%, attacked Syria twice, is aiding and abetting Saudi war crimes in Yemen, and has neocon extraordinaire John Bolton as his National Security Advisor. 	3. Sure.
@wayoffbroadwayy The policies Trump promotes are even more unpopular than him as a person. Repealing Obamacare, tax cuts for the rich, deregulation, the border wall - all wildly unpopular.		And I can absolutely deny it because it’s not true. Sanders and Trump are exact *opposites* on policy.
@JamesFurten @simmysamsozzle @areidross @Crumble_Dust No one is saying they’re against any of that stuff, dumbass. They’re saying they’re against your anti-semitism.		And anyone who says “I’m not a Nazi because I’m not a member of the literal German Nazi Party” is definitely a Nazi.
@wayoffbroadwayy The policies that Trump supports are widely *unpopular* though. That’s in direct contrast to Bernie’s policies, which are supported by the majority of Americans.

@wayoffbroadwayy No, I’m from America as well. I agree the Overton Window here is disproportionately shifted toward the right, but if you look at the polling, virtually all of Bernie’s views are shared by the majority of Americans. Therefore I think it’s pretty reasonable to call him a centrist.

@jessdouglas37 While there are legitimate concerns to be had about the way Trump is handling Syria, they're not that he's "playing into Russia &amp; Iran's hands". It's that he's playing into Turkey's hands. Geez.

@marc_tacy @melbournecoal @jmartNYT What Bernie wants to do is make sure Walmart employees are paid a living wage and given good benefits. Walmart is an extremely profitable corporation.  Why do you think they should be able to underpay their workers? 		Workers don't benefit from stock buybacks, shareholders do.
@jemergence @mtaibbi The U.S. is the largest terrorist regime in the world, committing war crimes on the regular and providing military assistance to 73% of the world's dictatorships. It's currently assisting a genocide in Yemen. It has done anything *but* create peace and prosperity. Try again.
@marc_tacy @melbournecoal @jmartNYT Most Walmart employees won't be to retire anyway with the meager amount of money they're paid. Bernie's bill would incentivize Walmart to actually pay their employees a living wage.

@ExistentialEnso I don't really think appearing on a news network is the same thing as consciously cooperating with fascists. I mean, Sanders and BLM activists have appeared on RT as well. 		Why should appearing on RT should treated be any different than appearing on say, Al-Jazeera?
@ExistentialEnso Russia did indeed post pro-Stein stuff. They also posted pro-Sanders and pro-BLM stuff. It means nothing. The only reason corporate media is reporting on this is to smear and undermine progressive candidates and movements by painting them all as tools of Russia.
By coupling U.S. withdrawal from Syria with an arms deal to Turkey, Trump is essentially giving them the greenlight to slaughter the Kurds. Progressives shouldn't support him on this.
I'm gonna probably lose followers for this, but Trump's move on Syria is bad. While I generally do support withdrawal of troops, the way he's going about it will cause more harm than good.

@RockyRidgesPal @sunnyettepe @politico It needs to be someone that’s a strong messenger. The problem with a lot of these candidates is that they’re too soft-spoken or come off as a typical politician. 		Saying stuff like “America is already great” as Hillary did isn’t going to effectively counter Trump’s message.
@RockyRidgesPal @sunnyettepe @politico I think running someone like Kerry who’s already lost a presidential election to a Republican would be a big mistake. 		My main concern about Warren running is that she could potentially eat into the support of Sanders and end up giving us someone like Biden.
@RockyRidgesPal @sunnyettepe @politico One thing about Gillum is that he’s charismatic and handled himself very well against DeSantis. Might come in handy against Pence in a debate.		And I do think it’d be a good idea to have a POC on the ticket.
@RockyRidgesPal @sunnyettepe @politico I mean, yeah, I think she handled the DNA thing very poorly. 		I like her, but once again, not my first choice.
@RockyRidgesPal @sunnyettepe @politico I can’t really think of any Southerners I’d want on the ticket. Maybe Gillum or Abrams for VP, but then again they lost their races.
@RockyRidgesPal @sunnyettepe @politico I dunno, I like Warren as a candidate. She’s not my first choice, and I’m not really sure how effective she’d be against Trump, but I do like her.
@RockyRidgesPal @sunnyettepe @politico I still think it depends more on the individual candidate than where they’re from. But yes, I don’t see Kamala Harris or Eric Swalwell doing particularly well in an election against Trump.
@RockyRidgesPal @sunnyettepe @politico I just don’t agree with the assertion that having someone from California on the ticket would cost us these races.
@RockyRidgesPal @sunnyettepe @politico I mean, I don’t support Kamala Harris or Eric Swalwell, but I’m not necessarily opposed to having someone from California on the ticket. 		Quite frankly, the Republicans are going to use the socialist line on the Democratic nominee regardless of who it actually is.

@SarcasmStardust Could things be better? Sure. But I don't see why you'd wanna downplay all the progress we've made so far. 		And pray tell, if taking over the party is a "waste of time", what's *your* solution?
@SarcasmStardust Pretty good, actually. The majority of House Democrats are now co-sponsors of Medicare For All. The Progressive Caucus is now getting proportional representation on key committees. Bernie Sanders is a frontrunner for the 2020 nomination.
@SarcasmStardust I mean, you seem to think that stating basic facts qualifies as mental gymnastics, so... 🤷‍♀️
@SarcasmStardust LMAO. Talk about projection. I responded to your argument - instead of actually addressing what I said you just accused me of "mental gymnastics" because you didn't want to admit that you were wrong.

@TodayAgain1 @nathansnewman @feraljokes Bernie isn’t divisive at all. He’s been a team player. He campaigned for tons of Democrats during the midterms, even centrist ones.

@Highvoltage4u @TheCapitalistPg @HolleyA @voxdotcom @mattyglesias It’ll be funny seeing you people cry when he wins.
@nathansnewman @TodayAgain1 @feraljokes I don’t think so. Bernie consistently polls as one of the frontrunners in the race. And when the contest actually starts and we finally get a taste of what the candidates look like in action, MoveOn will 100% endorse Bernie again. I guarantee it.

@WalkerBragman Very disappointed to hear this. I expected better from a Justice Democrat.
@tiredsias @feraljokes @butleriano Yes, there was coverage of her in progressive media, which is what I said. But I don't think being written about in the Intercept or the Nation makes you a national figure.
@tiredsias @feraljokes @Adorably_Nerdy Well I have no problem with attacking the party apparatus so 🤷‍♀️
@tiredsias @feraljokes @butleriano No, she was not a national figure before winning the primary lol. You and I may have known about her, but most people didn't. 		A large reason she won was because of the support of progressive media and organizations, which were inspired and energized by Bernie.
@tiredsias @feraljokes @Adorably_Nerdy 1. She pretty clearly insulted Crowley several times throughout her primary campaign. 	2. Criticizing Democrats isn't "abusing" them. 	3. Bernie barely ever goes after Democrats these days. He campaigned for a whole bunch of them during the midterms, even ones he disagrees with.
@tiredsias @feraljokes @butleriano having already popularized those progressive policies and energizing a movement.
@tiredsias @feraljokes @butleriano He wasn't able to drum up his support before because he wasn't well-known and virtually all of Congress was controlled by corporate interests. The reason AOC can drum up support so early is because she's been a national figure ever since winning her primary and due to Bernie
@tiredsias @feraljokes @butleriano His job is to get positive change through, which is exactly what he's doing. 		Your initial claim was silly, one that I proved wrong, and you just don't want to admit it.
@tiredsias @feraljokes @butleriano Virtually the entirety of Bernie's legislative agenda is in direct contrast to what corporate interests want.
@tiredsias @feraljokes @butleriano What Bernie has done is use his power, influence, and leverage as a national politician to get what he wants. If he weren't a politician and were just an activist instead, these things wouldn't have happened. You're looking at the method - I'm looking at the results.
@tiredsias @feraljokes @butleriano I am not "artificially inflating" the definition lol. What makes a good politician is if they're able to achieve their goals, which is what Bernie is in the process of doing right now, regardless of how it's done.
@tiredsias @feraljokes @butleriano The fact that Bernie wasn't able to get more progressive reforms passed seems to be more of an indictment of our corporate-controlled Congress rather than of Bernie himself.
@tiredsias @feraljokes @butleriano And Bernie actually does have a good record of getting strong progressive reforms passed while in Congress. 		https://t.co/dOnxhWC5NQ
@tiredsias @feraljokes @butleriano Bernie is in the midst of creating the environment to allow progressive policies to pass. When we finally get things like Medicare For All enacted, it will be because the work he did.
@tiredsias @feraljokes @butleriano Only if you have a very narrow view of what a politician's role is. The things I mentioned are major and important accomplishments - the fact that they weren't actual legislation doesn't change that. Just because he's an unconventional politician doesn't mean he's not a good one.
@tiredsias @feraljokes @butleriano No, I don't think being a politician is just about popularity. If you had actually bothered to read my tweet, you'd see that I listed substantive accomplishments of Bernie's such as moving the Democratic Party left and raising wages for thousands of workers.
@justicedems Why did @RepRaulGrijalva abstain?
@fritolaysia @_waleedshahid I took her comment as meaning while she supports progressive policies and reforms, she fundamentally believes in maintaining the capitalist framework of the economy. That's really not substantively different from Bernie at all - he just for some reason calls himself a socialist.
@fritolaysia @_waleedshahid How so? Social democrats *are* capitalists.
@DouglasLFarrar @_waleedshahid Too many? There's too little!
@TheCapitalistPg @HolleyA @voxdotcom @mattyglesias Are you?
@HolleyA @voxdotcom @mattyglesias Yes he is, and he's gonna be your next president. Better get used to it, buddy!
@tiredsias @feraljokes @butleriano for thousands of workers. By any objective measure, he's a fantastic politician. Maybe there's a few handful of Democrats that don't like him, but the reality is that the overwhelming majority of them do like him.
@tiredsias @feraljokes @butleriano It's really not - you said that Bernie wasn't a good politician, which is just untrue. He got 46% of pledged delegates, has shifted the party left to the point where almost every potential 2020 candidate has adopted his agenda, and used his influence to get Amazon to raise wages

@Adorably_Nerdy @feraljokes she won by running against another democrat lol
@nathansnewman @feraljokes Neither does Bernie.
@tiredsias @feraljokes @butleriano Bernie’s rhetoric against the party itself was a big part in what inspired so many primary challenges like AOC’s against incumbent Democrats.
@tiredsias @feraljokes @butleriano Because when Bernie first ran, the party *WAS* against what everyone wanted. It’s only after he popularized the message that the party has begun to finally get on board.		And in fact AOC used a very similar tactic when against Crowley - “we have people, they have money”.

@MacMargi Lol. Perhaps you should start realizing that every single scientific poll that's been done on 2020 has two old white guys as the frontrunners. That's just the reality. 		Bernie has a track record of actually fighting for these policies. The others only adopted them two years ago.

@Emilinalala @libbycwatson @hamiltonnolan 1. He got 46% of pledged delegates despite the DNC actively attempting to sabotage his campaign.	2. Bernie consistently polls better than most of the other candidates against Trump.	3. 64% of POC view him favorably.	4. 78% of Democrats view him favorably.
@Emilinalala @libbycwatson @hamiltonnolan If you don’t think the most popular politician in the country could muster a solid campaign as an independent, then perhaps you’re the one that needs to take a logic class.
@Emilinalala @libbycwatson @hamiltonnolan So you want Trump to win then.
@Emilinalala @libbycwatson @hamiltonnolan So the anti-Trump vote can be split? No thanks.
@KarandikarAkhil @cushbomb @BenSpielberg @hamiltonnolan The only candidate who really rivals Bernie in the name recognition/popularity area is Biden, and I have a hunch that his poll numbers are going to drop significantly when the debates actually start and stuff like his votes for the Iraq War and gutting of welfare get brought up.
@KarandikarAkhil @BenSpielberg @cushbomb @hamiltonnolan I think there's a very large difference between staying neutral in a race as Bernie did and actively endorsing the corporatist as Gillibrand did.
@KarandikarAkhil @cushbomb @BenSpielberg @hamiltonnolan One thing I'd also add in favor of Bernie is not only do you have a decades-long progressive track record, but also name recognition and popularity that far exceeds most of the other candidates. That's going to help a lot when it comes to winning the primary.
@KarandikarAkhil @cushbomb @BenSpielberg @hamiltonnolan It's a good thing in the sense that she can be pressured to vote for progressive policies while in the Senate. But it's not a person you want to elevate to the most powerful position in the country, where she can easily turn around and backstab us.
@BenSpielberg @cushbomb @hamiltonnolan Perhaps also worth noting - this was Khanna's response when @EmmaVigeland said he should run in 2020. I'm wondering if maybe he knows something we don't? Lol. https://t.co/BwVNRNBS2n
@BenSpielberg @cushbomb @hamiltonnolan I really like Khanna - he was the first member of Congress to call for expanding the Supreme Court. I trust him, but I think he'd better suited for a Cabinet position or leadership role in Congress rather than a presidential candidate.
@KarandikarAkhil @cushbomb @BenSpielberg @hamiltonnolan I don't know where you're getting the 15 number from. It's true that people like Gillibrand, Harris, and Booker have staked out some good progressive positions lately, but their prior track records reek of corporate neoliberalism. They're opportunists, not principled progressives
@KarandikarAkhil @cushbomb @BenSpielberg @hamiltonnolan 15? There's two.
@KarandikarAkhil @cushbomb @BenSpielberg @hamiltonnolan Considering that there are virtually no progressives in the Senate at all, that's an extremely low bar.
@KarandikarAkhil @cushbomb @BenSpielberg @hamiltonnolan Warren maybe, but definitely not Gillibrand. She endorsed Crowley over Ocasio-Cortez, Cuomo over Nixon, co-sponsored the anti-BDS bill last year, and voted to extend the Patriot Act in 2011.

In 2015, Eoin Higgins said it was an "ideological disaster" to support Sanders because he wasn't progressive enough. Now he's supporting Gillibrand - who has voted to withhold funds from sanctuary cities, extend the Patriot Act, and endorsed Crowley over Ocasio-Cortez. https://t.co/vFDUj7cIQd
@EoinHiggins_ @ben_geier @MitchellCares @hamiltonnolan In 2015 you wrote a piece declaring it was an "ideological disaster" to support Sanders because he wasn't progressive enough. Now you're supporting a candidate that's more conservative than him? 🤔		https://t.co/uwc544Xkb7

@LisaSeaFL @yusuf_VI @EoinHiggins_ @hamiltonnolan Bernie is an independent. He ran as a Democrat in the presidential primary because the system is rigged in favor of the two major parties. 		I'm not saying that the Democrats have never done anything good, but they're a hollow shell of FDR's party.
@wayoffbroadwayy @partfire01 @czechov @ComradeStar You can't earn $1 billion, so no, taxing that amount wouldn't be theft.
@partfire01 @wayoffbroadwayy @czechov @ComradeStar Yes, basically I think it should be illegal to be a billionaire.
@wayoffbroadwayy @partfire01 @czechov @ComradeStar We were able to bail out Wall Street just fine - we can easily bail out the people. Studies show that canceling student debt would grow the economy. 		And last year's increase in the military budget alone is enough to pay for free college. 		https://t.co/i7P7EHBwcG
@partfire01 @wayoffbroadwayy @czechov @ComradeStar I don't see how a maximum wage is "adding another ceiling to the workers". I'm talking about taxing all income $1 billion+ at 100%. That's a radically redistributive policy.
@wayoffbroadwayy @partfire01 @czechov @ComradeStar Fun fact: Bernie actually used to support abolishing the CIA back when he was younger, as well a maximum wage.		Imo the CIA should be abolished and replaced with a new agency limited only to collecting intelligence.		https://t.co/c4ZpY29DHO
@HappyOldSoul @CharlesPPierce @freeandclear1 @hamiltonnolan @EoinHiggins_ You said "a lot". 		There have been scientific polls done on this matter, and 20% of Sanders supporters voted for Trump or a third party candidate. That's compared to 25% of Clinton supporters that voted for McCain in 2008.
@wayoffbroadwayy @partfire01 @czechov @ComradeStar cancel all student debt, and institute a maximum wage and universal basic income.
@wayoffbroadwayy @partfire01 @czechov @ComradeStar Yeah, Bernie is to my right, but he's the best we've got right now.		If it were up to me, I'd abolish the DHS, CIA, DEA, and SSS, end the drone strike program, join the ICC, prosecute all presidents for war crimes, completely end our alliance with Israel, legalize all drugs,
I can't overstate how wrong it is! Bernie is the only candidate that would actually fight for those issues if elected. The rest of them would cave on day #1. https://t.co/xeEal88hlF
@HappyOldSoul @CharlesPPierce @freeandclear1 @hamiltonnolan @EoinHiggins_ Not really. There may be a few handful that aren't fans, but the vast majority of Democrats like Sanders and in fact want candidates to be more like him.		And the vast majority of his supporters voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016.
@wayoffbroadwayy @partfire01 @czechov @ComradeStar She's for abolishing ICE.
@mtsw It's the correct take if you want the Democratic nominee to be someone that sucks.
@TheGenerationME @HumanistReport https://t.co/y8V04uiVMV
1. Eliminating the Electoral College doesn't violate the Constitution.	2.

According to the author of this piece, the "smart" thing for Bernie to do would be to waste all the popularity and progressive energy he's harnessed and simply endorse a corporatist like Kamala Harris or Sherrod Brown in the primary. What a horrendous take. https://t.co/52Z6qcFWH5

@HappyOldSoul @CharlesPPierce @freeandclear1 @hamiltonnolan @EoinHiggins_ I’m pretty sure he will win the nomination and the presidency.
@EoinHiggins_ @MitchellCares @hamiltonnolan I am outright saying he will win the primary.
@wayoffbroadwayy @partfire01 @czechov @ComradeStar The only candidate I know that ran on open borders was Chelsea Manning.
@wayoffbroadwayy @partfire01 @czechov @ComradeStar Nope, definitely both of them. Virtually all the policies they support have majority support from the public.
@partfire01 @wayoffbroadwayy @czechov @ComradeStar How do you guarantee healthcare without a government to pay for medical expenses? Even if workers own the means of the production, they still need to get paid.
@partfire01 @wayoffbroadwayy @czechov @ComradeStar I agree that most politicians are conservatives. People like Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez I’d call centrists.
@partfire01 @wayoffbroadwayy @czechov @ComradeStar I don’t really see how you could realistically guarantee healthcare in an anarchist society.
@wayoffbroadwayy @partfire01 @czechov @ComradeStar I don’t agree that Trump supporters aren’t conservatives. They agree with the overwhelming majority of conservative policies. They only deviate from orthodoxy on a handful of issues such as trade.
@wayoffbroadwayy @partfire01 @czechov @ComradeStar As for open borders, I have mixed feelings. I like the concept, but I don’t see how it could practically be implemented within the context of a welfare state.
@wayoffbroadwayy @partfire01 @czechov @ComradeStar How do you propose we get a living wage and universal healthcare then?		Free trade is just an euphemism for offshoring. Axing the TPP was the one good thing Trump did.
@wayoffbroadwayy @partfire01 @czechov @ComradeStar “I agree with Bernie on 70% of the issues! We just disagree on economics!”		Well okay, but economics was at the very core of Bernie’s campaign. You’re the antithesis of Bernie when it comes to his most important issues and priorities.
@wayoffbroadwayy @partfire01 @czechov @ComradeStar Agh, their names are too similar - I keep mixing them up.		There are indeed some similarities, but we can’t overlook that there are major differences as well.		I remember Gary Johnson tried this argument in 2016 to try and get Sanders supporters to vote for him:
@wayoffbroadwayy @partfire01 @czechov @ComradeStar “If Bernie just changed his position on several major policy issues central to his ideology, he wouldn’t be too far off from Rand Paul!”
@JohnSeaborn I remember them all saying that it proved AOC doesn't understand politics. Complete projection.

@DigitalCheeze @ShaunHensleyCA @010_10_101 By the way, this is the DNC rule. All Sanders has to do in order to get on the ballot is a send a letter to the DNC saying that he's a Democrat, will accept the nomination, and will serve as one. That's a pretty easy thing to do. https://t.co/cOBOGRfK2e
@DigitalCheeze @ShaunHensleyCA @010_10_101 I could say the same thing to you, considering you've gotten several facts wrong in just this one tweet: 		1. Vermont does have parties. 	2.

@DigitalCheeze @ShaunHensleyCA @010_10_101 What exactly do you think running within the Democratic Party means? It's pretty obvious that means joining it. Perhaps you should just admit you were wrong instead of doing mental gymnastics in order to defend your original false claim.

@logicrats @amb573 @TheAllenEcho @OsitaNwanevu And like I said before, there are constant false equivalences made between the far-right and the left. I'm constantly seeing articles pushed out by the media that try and conflate figures like Trump with people like Sanders or Corbyn. It's ridiculous.
@logicrats @amb573 @TheAllenEcho @OsitaNwanevu On the other hand, the mainstream media remains sharply biased towards the right (despite what Republicans may claim) and we still see far too much tone-policing in the name of civility.
@logicrats @amb573 @TheAllenEcho @OsitaNwanevu I support single-payer. Current political dialogue is a mixed bag. On the one hand, we're starting to see a shift to the left within the Democratic Party and country as a whole, which is good.
@logicrats @amb573 @TheAllenEcho @OsitaNwanevu I don't really see how that's the case, but okay then.
@logicrats @amb573 @TheAllenEcho @OsitaNwanevu I mean, you did try and compare me to a fascist, so...
@amb573 @logicrats @TheAllenEcho @OsitaNwanevu However, that's largely due to the Overton Window in the U.S. being so far to the right. Many people who claim to be centrists or are described as such by the media are really just right-wingers.
@amb573 @logicrats @TheAllenEcho @OsitaNwanevu I agree and disagree. It's not at all uncommon for self-proclaimed centrists to coddle up to fascists while simultaneously viciously attacking progressives.

@gawdz0rz She used to very conservative while in the House. She had a 100% rating from the NRA. Also voted to increase deportations and withhold funds from sanctuary cities. She's become more progressive since joining the Senate, but she still voted to extend the Patriot Act in 2011.
@logicrats @TheAllenEcho @amb573 @OsitaNwanevu the fuck is a logicrat
@gawdz0rz Sanders and Warren are the only candidates I'd support in 2020. I need someone with an actual progressive track record. Gillibrand, Booker, and Harris have all staked out some good positions recently, but none of them can really be trusted to actually fight for those policies.

@ThewrongR @Rontildawn @Liverpotlian How many times do I have to tell you that every single poll has Bernie beating Trump?		He will win. Duh.
@ThewrongR 1. No, not every poll has everyone beating Trump.	2. Hillary’s lead was much smaller than Bernie’s.	3. Bernie is actually popular and well-liked, whereas Hillary rivaled Trump in terms of unpopularity.
@ThewrongR @gawdz0rz I find it absolutely hilarious that you’re acting all condescending and treating me as if I’m some sort of idiot when you think that ableist is a made up word. 😂🤣		You don’t even have the common sense to look it up first in order to prevent yourself from looking like a fool.
@ThewrongR Yes, polls matter. No serious political commentator believes otherwise. The polls were right about 2016 (contrary to popular belief). There’s no reason to believe they’re wrong about this.
Except I did use it correctly. A primary is different than a general, genius. 		Example: Just because Luther Strange lost to Roy Moore in the primary doesn’t mean he would have also lost Doug Jones in the general if he were the nominee. https://t.co/AoeCQPegEO

@ThewrongR 1. Cool it with the ableism.	2. Literally all the data shows that he would win. You’re just like a Trump supporter - you ignore facts when they don’t fit your narrative.
@ThewrongR @Rontildawn @Liverpotlian Yes, because his opponent was also widely hated as well.		And here’s one from September 2018. Bernie still has widespread support, whether you like it or not.		https://t.co/BNU5MOhgge
@53w63 Yeah, but the difference is Bernie stayed neutral during the race. Gillibrand actively endorsed Crowley over Ocasio-Cortez.
@tommy_pane @Rontildawn @ThewrongR @Liverpotlian Yes.

@ThewrongR @Liverpotlian If you actually want to beat Trump in 2020, work to ensure that Bernie wins the nomination. Simply yelling at people on Twitter doesn’t do anything to help defeat Trump.
@ThewrongR @Liverpotlian You’re the one that lacks critical thinking. Hillary ran a *horrendous* campaign in 2016. She lost to the most unpopular presidential candidate in modern history.		What I’m saying is we need to avoid making the same mistakes we made in 2016 and nominate someone who can win.
actually i’m right https://t.co/4Pj214nomd
More Sanders supporters voted for Hillary in 2016 than Hillary supporters did for Obama in 2008. Perhaps we shouldn’t have made one of the most unpopular presidential candidates in modern history our nominee? Bernie would’ve won. https://t.co/6J0Gct0vev

@george10705 @sahilkapur Democrats are much more willing to compromise progressive principles than Republicans are willing to compromise conservative ones.
@ManAmongGods @S0lldus @BethLynch2020 Pelosi is a corporate shill that doesn't support Medicare For All and voted to give Trump warrantless spying powers. Why *woudn't* we attack her? Do you even know what progressivism and socialism are?
@george10705 @sahilkapur You'll never get a single Republican to vote for more funding of Social Security or welfare. Their version of reforming them is cutting benefits, and that should be blocked.
@george10705 @sahilkapur I don't see the Republicans passing the Dream Act. If they actually cared about the Dreamers, they would've already passed it by now.
@george10705 @sahilkapur And the current Republican Party is controlled by hardcore nativists. There's no way they'd ever work with the Democrats to actually enact positive immigration reform.
@george10705 @sahilkapur I don't consider Social Security/welfare reform to be "productive legislation". I consider it something that must be blocked at all costs.
RT @DavidDTSS: if Colin Kaepernick had beaten a woman instead of kneeled during the anthem he'd still be in the NFL right now.
@george10705 @sahilkapur I said to block virtually all GOP bills, not literally all of them. So in other words, the overwhelming majority of them. Unfortunately, I just don't see very many areas where the Democrats can work with Republicans to achieve something positive.
@george10705 @sahilkapur I disagree. The most productive thing Democrats can do is to block virtually all GOP bills.

@FTthemusician @LeftwardSwing California is run by corporate Democrats - which is very different from progressives. Our Democratic Assembly Speaker blocked single-payer. Jerry Brown expanded oil drilling in the state. These people are far from being left-wingers.
@FTthemusician @LeftwardSwing The reason that California has such a high cost of living and poverty rate is because the Democrats here don't actually fight for and implement progressive policies.		And those things would be even worse if the Republicans were in charge.
@FTthemusician @LeftwardSwing Yes, California is run by *Democrats*. Democrats and left-wingers are not the same thing. Jerry Brown is not a progressive.

@LocoAstro @KristianStupid @williebermannn @Ocasio2018 Dude, you didn't get locked out because you "disagree with socialism". There are plenty of left-wingers that have been locked out of their accounts as well.		In fact, the CEO of Twitter has spoken out *against* progressive policies. He's not on our side.		https://t.co/ar9w9w9qDh

@LocoAstro @KristianStupid @williebermannn @Ocasio2018 The polls were right about the 2016 election - I have no reason to believe they're not right about this as well.
@LocoAstro @KristianStupid @williebermannn @Ocasio2018 It's not disingenuous at all. What's disingenuous is acting like polls can't be trusted or somehow got the 2016 election wrong when in reality they were only a single point off.
@LocoAstro @KristianStupid @williebermannn @Ocasio2018 Except they didn't get it wrong. The polls showed Clinton beating Trump in the popular vote by an average of three points - she ended beating him by two points. That's remarkably accurate - they were only a single point off. https://t.co/ug82FCZbtv
@LocoAstro @KristianStupid @williebermannn @Ocasio2018 The polls weren't "bad". In fact, they were very accurate. They had Clinton beating Trump by an average of three points. She ended up beating him by two points. That's a difference of a single point! https://t.co/4jTIBrDlUR

It takes a serious amount of privilege to believe the Dem Party is fine as it is. Pelosi and her defenders put civility over the needs of marginalized communities and actively enable fascism, all while shamelessly smearing those that advocate for social and economic justice.
Despite this, Pelosi voted to grant Trump warrantless spying powers. 		https://t.co/yo9ohmAPVF
Not only that, but they've also demanded that Facebook and Dreamhost hand over access to the private information of thousands of people who've either spoken out against the administration or visited a prominent anti-Trump website.		https://t.co/SMq1W7vTEg		https://t.co/ILNGRDcTcw
Trump and his administration have made their totalitarian bent and hostility to free speech clear, attempting to charge and arrest thousands of innocent people simply for protesting his inauguration.		https://t.co/uxAHTXR8Nx
Reminder that when Maxine Waters called for people to confront and hold accountable Trump Administration officials for their complicity in morally obscene policies and the normalization of fascism, Pelosi attacked her, calling her remarks "unacceptable".		https://t.co/Qginsx8Z5L
Right after the Dems took back the House, Pelosi immediately went to expressing the need to "strive for bipartisanship" with the GOP. People didn't elect Democrats to have them sing kumbaya with far-right extremists. They elected Dems to have them fight *against* the far-right.
Medicare For All is supported by 85% of Democrats and 70% of Americans at large. It is literally a life or death for thousands of people in this country. Yet Pelosi hasn't co-sponsored it and wants to deliberately make it harder for Democrats to pass it. But liberals don't care.
Nancy Pelosi wants to bring back PAYGO - which would severely hinder Democrats' ability to pass progressive priorities such as Medicare For All, tuition-free college, and a jobs guarantee. 		https://t.co/42G54vTOEp

@BurgSkeletal Not really. If you look at the polls, Bolsonaro's support level stayed roughly at the same level it was prior to being stabbed. 		Political violence in this case would prevent a fascist from gaining power. So no, it's not self-defeating at all.
@BurgSkeletal Or perhaps he would've been replaced with a much more milquetoast candidate too scared to advocate the kind of stuff Bolsonaro did in fear of his life.

@mcyost The left needs to field a better challenger against DWS in 2020. Preferably one that runs as a Democrat and doesn't dabble in conspiracies or take neocon-esque positions on Iran and Israel.
@mcyost I went from enthusiastic support of him in 2016 to reluctant support of him in 2018, because I thought that a conspiratorial progressive was still better than a neoliberal &amp; that GOP poll had him tied with her (which ofc turned out to be bullshit). But after this stunt, not again
@mcyost Canova fucked up big time by running as an independent and beginning to peddle in conspiracy shit. He got over 40% of the vote in the 2016 primary. He had a real shot at winning this time around, but he chose to shoot himself in the foot instead. Now he's left with just 5%.

@Boringstein what do you think they're wrong about?
Spending even more on the military than Trump is not a point in Obama's favor. https://t.co/EEgRP20NXq
@chamberschild @_waleedshahid The GOP is a far-right extremist party that almost universally wants to make things worse for people. You'd be hard-pressed to find anything that you can work with them on. 		Pelosi and the Democrats should be striving for progressive policies, not bipartisanship.
@chamberschild @_waleedshahid The U.S. spends more on our military than the next seven countries combined. This is a colossal waste of money, especially when so many of our own people are struggling. The Democrats should present a clear, progressive alternative to the Republicans' incessant warmongering.
@chamberschild @_waleedshahid Pelosi is weak, spineless, and unpopular. She wants to bring back PAYGO, which would hurt Democrats' ability to pass progressive priorities. Having her as Speaker is a gift to Trump and the GOP.
@chamberschild @_waleedshahid Not true that I haven't named a person for Speaker. And you're the one doing what Trump wants. He literally just said the other day that Pelosi should be Speaker. 		https://t.co/YwAXA7mIDm
@chamberschild @_waleedshahid No, they should be passing strong progressive legislation in order to present a clear alternative to Trump &amp; the GOP's extreme far-right vision. 		I am not saying refuse to work with the GOP on anything, but fetishizing bipartisanship for the sake of bipartisanship is a bad look.
@chamberschild @_waleedshahid Either Barbara Lee or Ro Khanna would make fantastic choices.
@chamberschild @_waleedshahid The military budget should be reduced regardless of who's in charge, but especially while a maniac like Trump is in office. There shouldn't have been a single Dem that voted for the 2019 NDAA. 		And the Democrats had the power to block warrantless surveillance. They chose not to.
@chamberschild @_waleedshahid And perhaps Nancy Pelosi shouldn't be promoting "bipartisanship" with a racist far-right extremist party.
@chamberschild @_waleedshahid Well first of all, they can start by not voting to give him warrantless spying powers or increase his military budget.

@Mathemagicianme @bohemiantoo @Statistar30 @SenSanders By electing him president, we propel him to a platform and a position of power that makes it much easier for progressives to take control of the Democratic Party and win seats.

@Mathemagicianme @bohemiantoo @Statistar30 @SenSanders Bernie Sanders has a better chance at beating Donald Trump than Elizabeth Warren, and also better political instincts, a stronger progressive message than her, and is more willing to buck the establishment.

@albyselkie @StacyOh64 @tirelessirony @neeratanden @joemarchand @daveweigel To say that I don't get politics is a process is being deliberately disingenuous. Of course I get that. I just disagree that Medicare For All isn't viable. It's pretty clear you aren't operating in good faith here, so I'm gonna end the conversation. Go punch left elsewhere.
@albyselkie @StacyOh64 @tirelessirony @neeratanden @joemarchand @daveweigel LMAO. First it's "the only people who support Bernie are white". Now it's "single-payer can't pass because white people will be against it". You people really need make up your minds.
@albyselkie @StacyOh64 @tirelessirony @neeratanden @joemarchand @daveweigel If we don't have the votes, pass incremental reforms to improve Obamacare in the meantime. But never lose sight of the ultimate goal, and in the next elections work hard to elect progressive candidates that *will* vote for it.
@albyselkie @StacyOh64 @tirelessirony @neeratanden @joemarchand @daveweigel I am not expecting Medicare For All to be passed on day #1 of President Sanders' term. It will be a hard and drawn-out battle. We will have to deal with globs of corporate cash spent against it, as well as legal challenges from the far-right.
@albyselkie @StacyOh64 @tirelessirony @neeratanden @joemarchand @daveweigel If they did, support would go back up. And to say that it wouldn't benefit POC is just factually incorrect.		Politics is a process. Yes, not every progressive candidate won this year. There were significant losses. But a hell of a lot more candidates are running on it than before
@albyselkie @StacyOh64 @tirelessirony @neeratanden @joemarchand @daveweigel If "when asked to pay for it", you mean "presented with disingenuous arguments against Medicare For All", then yes, support does go down. The problem is the polling agencies don't include the counterarguments to the far-right talking points, which is political malpractice.
@albyselkie @StacyOh64 @tirelessirony @neeratanden @joemarchand @daveweigel The point is that it's just not true that lots of people disagree with us. Medicare For All is supported by the *overwhelming* majority of Americans. This what all the polls show.
@albyselkie @StacyOh64 @tirelessirony @neeratanden @joemarchand @daveweigel It's pretty obvious from my tweet that I understand what your premise is. You're the one that's having trouble understanding - because I never said that single-payer wouldn't raise taxes. Maybe go ahead and read it again.
@albyselkie @StacyOh64 @tirelessirony @neeratanden @joemarchand @daveweigel People have been hearing for over two years now that Medicare For All will increase their taxes and bankrupt the country, yet support for it only continues to grow. I don’t buy your premise.

@malarkynmemes @HungryComrade @TnrRienbolt It’s telling that you haven’t provided one. Perhaps because you know what you’re spouting is bullshit.

@NialElkim @clavedements @Ryan0666 @_michaelbrooks @Ziga_Iglic But also: Did it cover millions more people and protect pre-existing conditions. Yes. Was it far better than what we would’ve under a McCain presidency? Yes.
@NialElkim @clavedements @Ryan0666 @_michaelbrooks @Ziga_Iglic Under a Obama presidency, we got the ACA. Was it a disgrace we didn’t get single-payer instead? Yes. Was it ultimately a shitty, right-wing plan originally cooked up by the Heritage Foundation? Yes.
@NialElkim @clavedements @Ryan0666 @_michaelbrooks @Ziga_Iglic If you wanna say that they’re both bad, that’s fair. Saying they’re the same isn’t.		The fact of the matter is that most Democrats voted against Kavanaugh, tax cuts for the rich, and Obamacare repeal. Most Republicans voted for those things. That’s a real difference.
@NialElkim @clavedements @Ryan0666 @_michaelbrooks @Ziga_Iglic That’s just objectively incorrect, but okay then.
@chinchlady701 @ComradeStar No human is illegal.
@NialElkim @clavedements @Ryan0666 @_michaelbrooks @Ziga_Iglic That doesn’t make the same or equally as bad.
@NialElkim @ChrisLambMLM @_michaelbrooks @Ziga_Iglic It is, because it shows that Seder has a far greater grasp on the political realities of the situation we’re in than Dore.
@clavedements @NialElkim @Ryan0666 @_michaelbrooks @Ziga_Iglic No, what creates more apathy and disengagement is people like Jimmy Dore making false equivalences between the two major parties and going around saying that taking over the Democratic Party is useless.
@NialElkim @_michaelbrooks @Ziga_Iglic He said it in his 2016 debate with Sam Seder.
@NialElkim @_michaelbrooks @Ziga_Iglic You're also not taking into the account the fact that the Republicans would likely put into place more voter suppression laws and gut campaign finance regulation even further, which would make it even harder to progressives to win elections.
@NialElkim @_michaelbrooks @Ziga_Iglic For all we know, it could completely backfire on us and end up actually strengthening neoliberals by making people more eager to vote for them after such a long tenure of control by the far-right Republican Party. They'd be so desperate for an alternative, they wouldn't care who.
@NialElkim @_michaelbrooks @Ziga_Iglic And we both know how that turned out.		It just is not smart for progressives to put blind trust in and base our political strategy off of predictions made on such shaky ground. We have no idea if that'll actually happen.
@NialElkim @_michaelbrooks @Ziga_Iglic Why should we put stock in such a big and unsupported assertion? Especially when your side turned out to be completely wrong in your previous predictions? Dore thought the Democrats would just filibuster and block Trump's SC nominees and refuse to vote for his legislation.
@NialElkim @_michaelbrooks @Ziga_Iglic And you think allowing the far-right extremists in the Republican Party to win elections does? 😂🤣
@NialElkim @_michaelbrooks @Ziga_Iglic You're not helping weaken the neoliberal stranglehold on the Democratic Party, you're just helping to strengthen the fascist strangehold on the country.
@NialElkim @_michaelbrooks @Ziga_Iglic And the notion that allowing Republicans to win is how you get the Democrats to stop being neoliberals is ridiculous. If that were true, the party would've became a beacon of progressivism after Hillary lost. But it didn't.
@NialElkim @_michaelbrooks @Ziga_Iglic I "allowed" them to? I don't have any control over what the DNC does, buddy. And I've never done apologetics for either Clinton or Obama. 		The time to challenge neoliberal Democrats is in the primary, not the general.
@the1truepatri0t @NialElkim @_michaelbrooks @Ziga_Iglic I'M A FUCKING JAG-OFF NIGHT CLUB COMEDIAN AND EVEN I CAN SEE THIS FUCKING SHIT!
@NialElkim @Ryan0666 @_michaelbrooks @Ziga_Iglic No one here is saying that Hillary would’ve been good. We’re saying that she would’ve been better than Trump. 		If you genuinely believe that she would’ve been just as bad, you’re delusional.
@NialElkim @Ryan0666 @_michaelbrooks @Ziga_Iglic A Trump presidency has *far* worse consequences for poor people than a Clinton one, genius.
@NialElkim @_michaelbrooks @Ziga_Iglic I mean, if advocating for voting for the lesser of two evils makes you a liberal sell-out, what does advocating for allowing a fascist party to gain control of the country make you? 🤔
@NialElkim @_michaelbrooks @Ziga_Iglic Not everyone who disagrees with you is a sell-out, dude. It's easy to act self-righteous because you refused to support Hillary in the general, but there are real and devasting consequences to the Trump presidency that wouldn't be happening right now if she were president instead

@non_bona_dicta I live in California and I think Stein's criticism of the Democrats is totally useful. It's bringing attention to an important issue. It is not "contrarianism" - that's an *incredibly* stupid thing to say. Dixon is being the contrarian by attacking Stein for a valid critique.

@EddieFetherman No, most progressives realize that the only viable way to get the policies we want is through the Democratic Party. The ones who insist on going the third party route are a fringe vocal minority.
@EddieFetherman Is it happening as fast as I’d like? No, but it *is* happening.		And I never said that soldiers make the foreign policy, but it’s problematic to say the least that a so-called “progressive” would be proud of participating in illegal wars and helping spread U.S. imperialism.

We have to make clear that the Democrats are *much* better than the Republicans, but at the same time that they themselves need *a lot* of work. That's the *only* way things will ever get better.
We can't have any illusions about who the Democrats are. Pretending as if they're good is dangerous, just as acting like they're just as bad as the Republicans is dangerous. These two extremes must be avoided at all costs.
Would Dixon prefer that people just not bring up at all the fact that the Democrats are blocking single-payer? Does he not realize that if no one calls the Dems out on this, they'll just keep doing it? He is directly enabling the continued murder of the poor with his rhetoric.
In a recent video with Sam Seder, Dixon cited this Stein tweet as an example of contrarianism on the left. But this isn't contrarianism at all. It's a perfectly valid criticism of the Dems. Dixon himself is being the contrarian by attacking her for this.		https://t.co/Yge8gbtGqa
Here's the problem with that: strong criticism of the Democrats is *needed* in order to force them to the left. They're never gonna shift left willingly. They're gonna have to be dragged kicking and screaming to the correct positions.
But Dixon's rhetoric is reckless as well. He engages in *way* too much apologetics for Democrats, being quick to label any strong criticism of the party "contrarianism" (this is not dissimilar to how Dore labels any arguments in favor of voting for harm reduction "shilling").
Dore has flat out said on multiple occasions that taking over the Democratic Party is useless and a waste of time. That rhetoric is extremely reckless, for obvious reasons.
I disagree that he’s a voice we should be elevating. Dixon &amp; Dore are *both* ultimately damaging to the progressive cause, for different reasons. The *only* viable way we get progressive policies is to move the Dem Party left, &amp; this is a goal that both these two are undermining. https://t.co/hIz0ZEnFCJ

@missfaithfriday @bellaco48128 @ianistrash1 @ztsamudzi @GeeDee215 The logical extension of the pro-Hillary position is support for deportations, war crimes, warrantless surveillance, and allowing billionaires to buy our elections.

@AmericanDad_002 "Educate yourself on the facts" says the person who thinks Obama is a socialist. Sure. 🙄		Perhaps you should stop defending slave owners, you racist sack of shit.
@AmericanDad_002 Once again, people who want to end slavery don't own slaves.		And get the fuck out of here with your bullshit moral relativism. Owning slaves is wrong now and was back then as well. The fact that it was viewed as acceptable doesn't change that. Go fuck yourself.
@AmericanDad_002 People that are against slavery don't own slaves. This isn't hard to grasp, dude.
@AmericanDad_002 Not the sharpest tool in the shed, now are you buddy?
@AmericanDad_002 Someone who thinks that Obama is a "socialist extremist" doesn't have any right to lecture anyone else on not knowing what they're talking about. 		And it's a fact that the Founding Fathers owned slaves. That's pretty basic stuff. I guess you didn't pay attention in history class
@AmericanDad_002 If you support slave owners' vision of the country, then yes, you're *definitely* far-right.
@AmericanDad_002 Dude, you said that there shouldn’t be any social services whatsoever. It’s pretty clear that you’re far-right.
@AmericanDad_002 @thedailygruel Perhaps you should invest in purchasing a dictionary. Obama was a center-right capitalist politician that served the interests of Wall Street and the rich.		And FYI, capitalism has killed millions more than communism.

@LouG61C @lexi4prez explicitly grants the freedom of religion.  		As for stop and frisk, it disproportionately affects minorities and rarely finds any weapons. It's a wildly ineffective policy. In fact, crime actually went *down* in New York after they got rid of it.
@LouG61C @lexi4prez That's the same flawed kind of logic that lead us to throw innocent Japanese people in internment camps. We can't allow paranoia and bigotry to dictate our public policy. Not to mention that banning Muslims from entering the country would be unconstitutional, as the 1st Amendment
@LouG61C @lexi4prez None of which fit the bill of a limited federal government and many of which are in outright violation of the Constitution.
@LouG61C @lexi4prez Trump supports banning an entire religious group from entering the country, torture, stop and frisk, banning flag-burning, delicensing news networks that cover him negatively, raising taxes on the NFL due to the anthem protests, and warrantless surveillance.
@LouG61C @suzytica @ChucoTownMom @Chambers52D @finefoodlover @tedcruz @BetoORourke I mean, of course polls taken further away from the election are going to be less accurate. Circumstances change. If the election took place earlier, Hillary's performance probably would've been more in alignment with those earlier polls.
@DPitar2 @HumanistReport You're a fucking idiot. Universal healthcare would objectively work better than our current system - and it'd save money, too. Perhaps don't comment on things you know nothing about.

@LouG61C @suzytica @ChucoTownMom @Chambers52D @finefoodlover @tedcruz @BetoORourke Yes, and they were right to show Hillary in the lead, because Hillary got more votes than Trump! This isn't a hard concept to grasp.
@LouG61C @lexi4prez Considering the fact that you're a Trump supporter, you're not really one to be lecturing others on not understanding the Constitution.
@LouG61C @suzytica @ChucoTownMom @Chambers52D @finefoodlover @tedcruz @BetoORourke Yes, the info is right out there at my fingertips. And that info proves me correct. The polls did not show Hillary winning by a landslide. Take a look for yourself:		https://t.co/y7sUoZjatq

@CrissaKentavr @LasagnaGarden 1. Just because you disagree with the critique doesn't mean it isn't a critique.	2. Saying they voted for it isn't "misrepresenting the truth",  it's stating an objective reality.
@LouG61C @suzytica @ChucoTownMom @Chambers52D @finefoodlover @tedcruz @BetoORourke Except they didn't predict that. They predicted she'd win the popular vote by three points - she ended up winning by two. The polls were only a single point off. https://t.co/G0G6BzHwWP
@CrissaKentavr @LasagnaGarden 1. Criticizing the Democrats does not make you a "Republican supporter".	2. It's literally an objective fucking fact that they voted for it. Do you even fucking know what a lie is?
