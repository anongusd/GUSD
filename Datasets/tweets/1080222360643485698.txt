When you’ve worked hard your entire life, it’s only fair that you receive the retirement security you were promised. That’s why I cosponsored the Rehabilitation for Multiemployer Pensions Act, a bipartisan bill to protect pensions and ensure financial stability for retirees.
I’m honored to be in Selma today with @RepJohnLewis to remember the bravery of those who fought for the rights of every American to vote. Today, as we cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge, I remember how far we’ve come and how much more work we have left. #FPICivilRights https://t.co/lODsGRbFfC
This attack on my colleague @Ilhan is unacceptable. Hate in all forms is wrong.  		We are better than this, even if we disagree we must do so with civility. Anything else threatens our values. https://t.co/jIL2OAGvmV

Today thousands of Minnesotans are missing their paychecks because of the shutdown. That’s unacceptable. We should not be playing political games with people’s lives. We need to #EndThisShutdown.

Today I voted to reopen the government and make sure that no farmers are denied the relief they rely on, and no family or child in Minnesota goes hungry. We must end this shutdown now.
I voted today to end the shutdown so families aren’t at the risk of being evicted. This shutdown has caused too much uncertainty for Minnesotans.

We must end this shutdown now and provide certainty that hard-working families will receive their tax refunds on time, that farmers get the relief they are counting on and that federal workers again get paid for their work.
I believe that Americans deserve an effective, efficient and modern government that reflects the many advancements we’ve made over the years. That’s why I voted to establish a special House committee to make sure this is a top priority for this Congress.
In December I helped introduce the framework for the For The People Act, H.R. 1, and today I signed on as a cosponsor to fight to take the dark money out of politics, restore confidence in our government and make sure that your voices are heard.
RT @RepAngieCraig: My colleagues and I just voted to re-open the federal government, allowing tens of thousands of hard-working Minnesotans…
My colleagues and I just voted to re-open the federal government, allowing tens of thousands of hard-working Minnesotans to go back to work and restore their pay. Now it's up to the Senate to do their job.
On the first day of the 116th Congress, the House passed the first step toward restoring our fiscal responsibility. I will always fight to make sure Congress spends tax dollars wisely.
Today, I was sworn into the 116th Congress. It’s our job to work to ensure every Minnesotan has access to affordable, quality health care, to invest in the infrastructure of our communities and to prioritize career skills and technical education again. https://t.co/MUcgQMLnQa
