@kristabella Thanks for the tip! Just found it (Sept. 30 episode) - http://bit.ly/Vhry
@kristabella No, didin't know Krakauer was on the Daily Show. But we have the DVR set. Was it during the past week?
An √ºbermensch affects history indefinitely, re-entering the world through other people‚Äôs minds, affecting their thoughts and values.
Intriguing to view Tilly as an √ºbermensch (via Nietzsche), as Krakauer posits. Even though he would scoff at the lofty comparison.
Can't stop thinking about the book I finished last night, Where Men Win Glory: The Odyssey of Pat Tillman, by Jon Krakauer.
Ouch. Frosh criticizes Chow on Twitter. RT @ESPN_Pac10: UCLA all a-Twitter, but not in a good way - http://tinyurl.com/yhycpyb

@RPMaus @GopherSoccer looked pretty good Sunday. But baby N needed a change, so we hit up the Gibbs Museum and missed the late Buckeye goal.
@kristabella Not even we can believe she's that big. Visit anytime, Auntie KJ!
http://twitpic.com/m27a0 - The #redsox season barely ended a week ago and Dustin Pedroia is already bored, rummaging through my kitchen.
Back from a gorgeous afternoon watching Gopher women's soccer. Nine-month-old saw her first flip throw, but #UMN fell 1-0 to Ohio State.
