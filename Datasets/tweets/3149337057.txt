@NateSilver538 @UpshotNYT What's interested me is that in most Upshot polls, Dems dominate among "amost certain" voters, and the estimated total for those voters is much higher than Upshot's estimate. Seems like their estimate isn't expecting as big of a turnout as is being suggested.

@IAmKrishanPatel I too am anxiously waiting for a #NDSen poll. Reminder tho that she did dramatically outperform her 2012 polls as well.
@_BlueGeorgia_ Hmm. I'm very torn on ND and TN. I need to see more polling, out of ND especially. Heitkamp was down every poll in 2012 before winning. I think ND is better shot for the Dems than TN tbh.

@mmurraypolitics (L) will be much lower on election day tho, as it always is.
@SenhorRaposa @kkondik In today's world #MOSen is really going to come down to just urban turnout in St. Louis and Kansas City. @SenDonnelly however has a bit more non-urban appeal than McCaskill.
@mmurraypolitics I've been waiting all day! It's like Christmas morning!üéÖ
@_BlueGeorgia_ There is a path, but I think all three will go one way or the other. It's either gonna be a wave or not (especially with Dems needing a +6ish pop overall.) That should be enough for a Sen/Gov majority take over. All those Clinton-GOP districts are making me nervous too.
@_BlueGeorgia_ Eh. I don't think you can have one and not the other. Depending on the size of the wave (or no wave) I think the Dems with either get Sen, House and Gov majority, or none of them. They all seem to be at the same breaking point. It's gonna be all or nothing.

@SusanSaoirse @rockylee54 @dillman_diana @TulsiGabbard "it happened." then show me the receipts that it caused Clinton to win by 3.7 million. otherwise it is just speculation without evidence.
@SusanSaoirse @rockylee54 @dillman_diana @TulsiGabbard TBH, that's a really stupid reason to vote and it again sounds like a weak cover. "I knew that Clinton would win the primary who I voted for her for the primary, but I didn't want to." Do you not hear how stupid that is?
@SusanSaoirse @rockylee54 @dillman_diana @TulsiGabbard If they said that and didn't vote then they were never supporters in the first place. Also sounds like a good cover for those who were too lazy to vote. If you don't vote you have no voice. These people silenced themselves and can only blame themselves, not some voting delegate.
