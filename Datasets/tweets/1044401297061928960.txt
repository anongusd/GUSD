I don't understand why an account that gets suspended and restored has its following list wiped out, but that would explain the disappearing followers. If this is happening disproportionately to conservatives, that would explain why we lose batches of followers....
Twitter auto-suspended me because I uploaded a link from YouTube of a News Cast of Gov. Northam. It took me three days to get back and, naturally, my follow list got wiped out along with all of my likes, but at least society is protected from my anti-socialism views.
@slackjaw79 @Fishrocks1 @RepAdamSchiff I would follow you again, but last time I did that I got suspended.
@slackjaw79 @Fishrocks1 @RepAdamSchiff I think most Americans would agree that abortions should be legal for the first trimester and afterwards there must be a verifiable health issue for the mother. Would you agree with that? Because I would.
They wiped out my follow list.
Miss me? Twitter auto-banned me because I linked a video of Gov. Northam talking about post-birth abortions that was on YouTube...		Either that or because I'm conservative... hmm....
@slackjaw79 @Fishrocks1 @RepAdamSchiff Mr. Slackjaw, it is your use of the word "usually" that is the issue here.		This not about "mother's health". This is about abortion for convenience.
@NFW22b @slackjaw79 @Fishrocks1 @RepAdamSchiff I didn't delete it, Twitter deleted me, but I'm back.		The video was of Gov. Northam saying with absolute clarity that first the baby is delivered, THEN made comfortable and a discussion would ensue... to decide what?		Twitter decided posting YouTube video was a copyright issue.
@slackjaw79 @Fishrocks1 @RepAdamSchiff a^2+b^2=c^2 in a triangle is absolute. It has been proven in dozens of different ways. Science presently believes that large, dense bodies of matter bend space-time causing the earth to orbit the sun. Science previously believed other things. By the math thing will never change.
@slackjaw79 @Fishrocks1 @RepAdamSchiff Do you understand the point I was making about the difference between math, which is absolute, and science, which is more observational and theoretical?

@slackjaw79 @Fishrocks1 @RepAdamSchiff I assume the website, whose quotation marks those are, was correctly quoting Trump. Trump was not quoting anyone. I'm sure you understand the difference and are just being a troll at this point.
@slackjaw79 @Fishrocks1 @RepAdamSchiff Yes he did. https://t.co/AdmTwl4620
@slackjaw79 @Fishrocks1 @RepAdamSchiff If you require literal truth, you should try mathematics instead of science because science never gives you exact answers. It only gives you logical conclusions based on evidence. It is clear to me that Trump's interpretation is exactly was the Gov was talking about.
@slackjaw79 @Fishrocks1 @RepAdamSchiff Your profile says you want to be a science teacher. Can you confirm the accuracy of my transcription? If so, then we can debate what the "discussion" that would ensue would be about.		I doubt you support killing babies, but this racist Governor does. And Trump got that right.
@slackjaw79 @Fishrocks1 @RepAdamSchiff a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.
@slackjaw79 @Fishrocks1 @RepAdamSchiff Here I transcribed it for you:		If a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen THE INFANT WOULD BE DELIVERED, the infant would be kept comfortable, the infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired and then

@slackjaw79 @Fishrocks1 @RepAdamSchiff The quotation marks are not mine. They are from the website being discussed that claims that when Trump said these words, that Trump was lying when clearly he is not.
@slackjaw79 @Fishrocks1 @RepAdamSchiff I agree that we are discussing homicide. Listen again to what this racist Governor was saying. He is very clear that the baby is BORN. That it is ALIVE. And that a discussion THEN occurs about what to do. He doesn't say that one of the choices is murder, but that's the context.
@slackjaw79 @Fishrocks1 @RepAdamSchiff I expected you to make that argument - that when the President gives a correct and accurate accounting of what happened but doesn't quote the video literally then the President is lying.		If that is how the 8,000 "lies" are being determined, then it is clearly #FakeNews.

@BlueParrotBooks @KevinMKruse David Duke is supposed to be the damning example that proves that the Republicans are racists and in league with the KKK when in fact the KKK was a Democrat organization that was influential in Dem politics into the 1970's. Thousands of Dems were in the KKK. Duke was a fraud.
@BlueParrotBooks @KevinMKruse Uh oh. I may have triggered a lib. I better tone it down. Here's a picture to help you find your inner peace. https://t.co/S4wGcbyPf6
@BlueParrotBooks @KevinMKruse I need to research your claim? Sounds like I win.
@BlueParrotBooks @KevinMKruse Republicans passed an Act to end slavery in Washington D.C. paying slave owners compensation for their loss (a political necessity). Some became Republicans. I fail to see how this compares to the lynching, violence, slavery and rapes perpetuated by the Democrats and the KKK.
@BlueParrotBooks @KevinMKruse Does this person have a name?
@BlueParrotBooks @KevinMKruse That used to be the Georgian flag.
@BlueParrotBooks @KevinMKruse Grant ran as a Republican. Republicanism was new at the time. It was a Northern movement composed of persons opposed to slavery.		https://t.co/NDYZ4ipuy5
@BlueParrotBooks @KevinMKruse Michael, be honest. The whole tone of that article is the "surprise' that these Republicans would use Confederate symbology. A surprise that I share.		By the way, I haven't head of any of those Republicans. None of them are members of the Freedom Caucus or leadership.
@BlueParrotBooks @KevinMKruse Are there a lot of Confederate flag-waving Trump supporters? I haven't seen much of that, because I would agree with you that such a thing would be a contradiction. Republicans were the ones who defeated the Confederates and were morally opposed to everything they stood for.
@the_real_Lord @KevinMKruse You make a good point, Jebus, but there is a movement to deny the relationship between the KKK and the Democrats. There is a similar movement to paint the NAZI's and Hitler as "right-wingers". This is intended to persuade voters that the Dems have the higher moral ground.
@KevinMKruse Well, you've named a real person, but there is no evidence of an affiliation with the KKK. And, of course, he's not around to refute it.
@KevinMKruse Pretending the KKK was ever Republican or "right-wing" is the same as denying the the US had slavery. The KKK was a Democrat response in the South to the liberation of slaves by the Republicans. No Republican ever owned a slave. Trying to change history doesn't change history.
@KevinMKruse You make my point. David Duke was not only a Democrat, but a particularly corrupt Democrat. He ran as a Republican in a district where he could do so to win a Plurality race. There was no Republican authority with the power to refuse his run as a Republican, but he was denounced.
@KevinMKruse Searching for examples of Republican KKK members is an effort to deny reality.
@KevinMKruse Well that's an Orwellian lie. Like saying the Duke was a Republican. It is a fabrication. Tens of thousands of politicians and bureaucrats that were members of the KKK were Democrats. Very few were so-called Republicans. Since I'm guessing you know this, that makes you devious.
@KevinMKruse I'm confused. Are you trying to say that the KKK wasn't a Democrat organization?

@snkfinances @ConserveCtry @FrankLuntz @MariaBartiromo All Conservatives are Nationalists. At its core, we are up against communism, the Taliban and other opposition. Conservatives recognize that and oppose it.... with American pride and love for their country.
@ConserveCtry @FrankLuntz @MariaBartiromo Ding.
@ConserveCtry @FrankLuntz @MariaBartiromo Sadly, Trump is an outsider. That limits his options. Jeff Sessions was an all-time low.
@ConserveCtry @FrankLuntz @MariaBartiromo I love that Trump has outed the Marxists. Trump Derangement Syndrome is exposing the swamp, exposing the lib-tards, exposing the media-bias. I love it. There is not MORE socialism, it is just more EXPOSED as the lame policy it is and all the little sycophants are in plain sight.
@ConserveCtry @FrankLuntz @MariaBartiromo I don't see it. While I appreciate you working to fix things, I don't agree with the Never-Trumpers. They are missing the point. Trump is NOT a Bush. And that is ALL the difference in the world. Could we elect someone even more Conservative? I think so, but when? How? Who?

@ConserveCtry @FrankLuntz @MariaBartiromo You want to sit on the sideline and complain about the calls being made on the field. Yours is not the way to victory. Think strategically and tactically, don't just complain and accomplish nothing. Trump is on the field. Let's join him and move rightward or let AOC win?
@ConserveCtry @FrankLuntz @MariaBartiromo Even when Rand Paul cheers on Trump for bailing out of Syria, I refuse to retweet or like his comments... Rand Paul is the kind of guy that would allow World Wars to start. He's our Neville Chamberlain.
@ConserveCtry @FrankLuntz @MariaBartiromo RINO's are the enemy, not Trump. The DOJ and 92.8% of Washington D.C. are deep in the swamp. Trump is their opposition and the enemy of my enemy is my friend. Stop firing shots at the best hope currently on our side... unless you have a better idea?
@ConserveCtry @FrankLuntz @MariaBartiromo I don't hang with Rand Paul.... if he is your definition of a Libertarian,then no doubt that is where our misunderstanding began.
@ConserveCtry @FrankLuntz @MariaBartiromo Another trigger word... ;-)		The left has stolen words from our vocabulary. "Liberal" does not mean socialist or big government. "Leftist" does. or "Socialist".  "Progressive" is another word that has been stolen.
@ConserveCtry @FrankLuntz @MariaBartiromo I'm guessing your definition of Libertarian is different than mine. (Hint: I also think the definition on Wikipedia is wrong.)
@ConserveCtry @FrankLuntz @MariaBartiromo Finally, something we could talk about. I agree with you on every point except the backing down on the border. Trump wants a wall and I think he'll get it. But, yes, those other policies are all Big Government, which I oppose.
@ConserveCtry @FrankLuntz @MariaBartiromo I'm not the one who is failing to think. Or listen. Or understand.		You were "triggered" by the word Libertarian. Since then, our conversation has been pointless.		You're letting a word confuse you.		I doubt you could articulate Conservatism.		I offered up Buckley, Rand, Levin.

@ConserveCtry @FrankLuntz @MariaBartiromo You clearly do not understand conservatism. Read National Review. Read Americanism by Mark Levin. Read Atlas Shrugged. I like that you're rooting for my team, but I don't think you're representing the cause well. Happy to work with you, but you're attacking your allies.
@ConserveCtry @FrankLuntz @MariaBartiromo Wow.... deep end.
@ConserveCtry @FrankLuntz @MariaBartiromo You have been assuming my position from the beginning... not a great tactic. I'm a war hawk. The only good terrorist is a dead terrorist and I don't mind killing them before they attack. I like America having bases anywhere it wants especially to oppose socialism.
@ConserveCtry @FrankLuntz @MariaBartiromo You are coming across as a pedagogue. Trump is essentially the third most conservative president in the last 100 years. (Can you name the other two?)		To test whether you understand conservatism, would you point out where Trump has been other than conservative? There are a few.
@ConserveCtry @FrankLuntz @MariaBartiromo I don't think you're serving the conservative cause well. Speaking as someone more conservative to you, I suggest you spend less time telling me what I believe (especially since you are wrong as hell) and try to spend more time espousing the awesomeness of conservatism.
@ConserveCtry @FrankLuntz @MariaBartiromo You should learn what an Objectivist is. We're probably even more hard core than you.... ;-)
@ConserveCtry @FrankLuntz @MariaBartiromo Wait... are you saying Trump isn't Conservative? That will explain a great deal about why you and are talking past one-another.
@ConserveCtry @FrankLuntz @MariaBartiromo I'm an Objectivist. I'm a Libertarian. My spiritual leader is Jefferson. Are you understanding where I'm coming from? Stop assuming my position.
@ConserveCtry @FrankLuntz @MariaBartiromo Stop pretending I'm a Liberal. I understand your concern over Conservatism being under fire and I assure you, I am fighting at your side. Your right side because you're to the left of me, not the other way around. ;-)
@ConserveCtry @FrankLuntz @MariaBartiromo Hear, hear.
@ConserveCtry @FrankLuntz @MariaBartiromo Please stop telling me my views. You're wrong and there's no need since I'm happy to tell you my views myself.		While I believe I understand your point, you are painting me into a corner I don't belong in. Is there another phrase that would work for you?
@ConserveCtry @FrankLuntz @MariaBartiromo Perhaps I need to find another way of phrasing my position. But I assure you, I am to the right of Limbaugh and would drink Mark Levin's bath water. But there must be a way to express my acceptance of homosexuality. That example stands out to me at the moment.
@ConserveCtry @FrankLuntz @MariaBartiromo Both parties are a coalition of factions. A powerful group on the conservative side are Christians that see being gay as something less than being heterosexual. While I agree with most of their other positions, I don't agree with that one. What would you call that?
@ConserveCtry @FrankLuntz @MariaBartiromo Not me. In fact, I believe 80% of Americans are socially-liberal and fiscally-conservative. We don't get that choice. We have Coke and Pepsi. Two brands of the same crap. Nearly all of us agree with equal rights, equality before the law, freedom of speech, etc. But I hear you.
@ConserveCtry @FrankLuntz @MariaBartiromo Ah... we're confusing "socialism" with "socially liberal". Given the way the left steals our words, I see where you're coming from. But "socially liberal" does not mean hand-outs, reparations, or any of that socialist crap.
@ConserveCtry @FrankLuntz @MariaBartiromo Not at all. American government has no business in our bedrooms and a lousy track record on race, gender, and orientation.  Government should be limited both in taxes and scope, but also in its reach into our lives. Limited Government is SL/FC.
@eavesdropann @Danny4denise @DailyCaller Justice Ginsberg was the beginning of partisan legislation from the bench and, unless it is stopped, the downfall of America.  Vaya con Dios.

@mchooyah @swamp_monstah I remember when Al Gore said that we wouldn't have Ice Caps by 2014.  Of course, he has become a billionaire since saying that largely through his involvement with solar energy companies funded with government programs.... hmm....
I'm socially liberal but I think pretending transgenders are utterly "normal" can be harmful to the transgender. Many persons with gender dysphoria have more issues than just wrongful "gender assignment". They're more troubled than that. And that's not an issue for the military.

@MikkelsonsMad @TicaGibson @BrennanCenter @AOC @ProfCiara That's the point. Privatizing is the act of totalitarians. So when people call we capitalists "totalitarians" they are getting it precisely wrong. We believe in the free market! And the free market is the greatest thing to ever happen to the world.
@FCBojangles @PPact @ninaturner There is a huge difference between Democrat voters and Democrat politicians. Politicians will say whatever it takes to get elected and once elected will enact only those policies that benefit them either financially or get them re-elected. Their focus is on biggest numbers.
@MikkelsonsMad @TicaGibson @BrennanCenter @AOC @ProfCiara I find the best course is to read more than one view and think for yourself.		Even though Jeff Bezos is a leftist wonk (he owns WaPo), his company Amazon sells all books, even right-leaning ones. He hasn't gotten around to burning them yet because he is still enjoying capitalism.
@MikkelsonsMad @TicaGibson @BrennanCenter @AOC @ProfCiara Yeah, but that was more of "my form of tyranny is better than your form of tyranny".
@MikkelsonsMad @TicaGibson @BrennanCenter @AOC @ProfCiara Yeah, even Google leans left so googling takes time. You often have to look at the third or fourth page of results.... ;-)		We have to do our own homework and trust our gut. You can usually tell when someone or something is bullshit. People on podiums lie all the time.
@MikkelsonsMad @TicaGibson @BrennanCenter @AOC @ProfCiara Yes. Now, please compare that to the number of conquered countries.		Other regimes would have conquered countries. We establish bases and usually pay for them.
@MikkelsonsMad @TicaGibson @BrennanCenter @AOC @ProfCiara Ouch! I went back and re-read your tweet that started this chain, and you did not say that. Forgive me, I am the victim of twitter abuse.
@FCBojangles @PPact @ninaturner Hear, hear.
@MikkelsonsMad @TicaGibson @BrennanCenter @AOC @ProfCiara AH preached class warfare agitating workers to rise up against exploitation by the "capitalists". NAZI's wanted to nationalize education, health care, transportation, and industry. They implemented gun control and denounced Christians as "right-wingers".
@FCBojangles @PPact @ninaturner It's complicated. Dems depend on the black vote to get elected and therefore pander to them (just as Reps pander to the religious right), but what do they ever actually do to benefit blacks? The Dems are becoming more interested in the Hispanic vote. Where will that leave blacks?
@MikkelsonsMad @TicaGibson @BrennanCenter @AOC @ProfCiara Historians lean left, so please that that into account. And, history has been revised over the past sixty years. I ask again for proof that Hitler did not present himself as a socialist (other than his opposition to Communism).
@blorbio @MikkelsonsMad @TicaGibson @BrennanCenter @AOC @ProfCiara In America, we are given the choice of Democrats (socially liberal, fiscally liberal) and Republicans (socially conservative, fiscally conservative), but freedom lovers are socially liberal, fiscally conservative. Where is that party? It is like Coke and Pepsi. We need a choice.
@MikkelsonsMad @TicaGibson @BrennanCenter @AOC @ProfCiara The English monarchy hated my great, great, great... cousin Oliver Cromwell so much for briefly overthrowing them that two years after he was dead, they dug him up, hung him on display, beheaded him, and kept his head on a spike. That's what happens to people who oppose tyranny.
@MikkelsonsMad @TicaGibson @BrennanCenter @AOC @ProfCiara Indeed. That is what the American Revolution achieved and that most underestimate. For one of the first and most important times in history, We the People were subject to the Rule of Law instead of the Rule of a Sovereign. The government is ours instead of we belonging to it.
@MikkelsonsMad @TicaGibson @BrennanCenter @AOC @ProfCiara I think that is an important point. Both Communism and Fascism attempts to impose its world order on other countries and to disrupt Western countries at the point of a gun. That is imperialism. America, by contrast, is mostly isolationist. Freeing countries not conquering them.
@MikkelsonsMad @TicaGibson @BrennanCenter @AOC @ProfCiara Depends on your definition of liberal. Classical liberalism would today be called conservative. Also opposition to "democratic socialism" does not make fascism conservative. It simply make it another tyranny hiding in "caring about the people". Liberty is the opposite of fascism.
@FCBojangles @PPact @ninaturner Both sides are deliberately misleading all the time. I personally hate it when people I agree with intentionally mislead because I think it weakens our argument. That said, facts remain facts and screaming volumes of revisionism and efforts to silence opposing views is not right.
@MikkelsonsMad @TicaGibson @BrennanCenter @AOC @ProfCiara What, pray tell, is your evidence of that? Is it because Hitler didn't like Communism? That's the usual argument and it doesn't wash.
@blorbio @MikkelsonsMad @TicaGibson @BrennanCenter @AOC @ProfCiara You misunderstand my position. I believe if you stopped to think about it, you'd be socially liberal and fiscally conservative as all rational people are. Less government, not more. Less "equality" and more liberty.
@FCBojangles @PPact @ninaturner Dems opposed 1957 Civil Rights Act; opposed Brown V. Board of Education; opposed 1964 Civil Rights Act; opposed 1968 Civil Rights Act including the Fair Housing Act; opposed the Equal Credit Opportunity Act in 1974.
@MikkelsonsMad @TicaGibson @BrennanCenter @AOC @ProfCiara Socialism is the play of those looking to be in the ruling class. If Robin Hood were real, he would be trying to get elected. And, when he finally gets power, the only people who would have benefited would be his inner circle (Little John, Friar Tuck, etc.). The people would not.
@blorbio @MikkelsonsMad @TicaGibson @BrennanCenter @AOC @ProfCiara I feel the exact same way about the left. You realize the truth is probably in the middle somewhere right? Better to take in both sides and then think for yourself.
@MikkelsonsMad @TicaGibson @BrennanCenter @AOC @ProfCiara Agreed. Marx clearly had a better PR agent.
@FCBojangles @PPact @ninaturner Sophistry implies fallacious argument, but my argument is factual. The Republicans were founded on two principles: end slavery and end polygamy. (Yeah, that second one surprised me too.)		https://t.co/NDYZ4ipuy5
@MikkelsonsMad @TicaGibson @BrennanCenter @AOC @ProfCiara The videos of PragerU are very much academic and worthy of review and debate.

@MikkelsonsMad @TicaGibson @BrennanCenter @AOC @ProfCiara Socialism is always used by totalitarians to conquer ("reform") countries. They promise to take from the rich and give to poor because the poor outnumbers the rich and will often risk their lives to take for the rich. Millions die, the "socialists" take power and...never help.

@Jewthulhu @hbgreenphilly @AOC Regardless of how high you set the tax rate, the net tax revenue collected is always 17% of the GDP. This is an economic fact that is surprising and universal. So what does raising the tax rate do? It shrinks the GDP. What does lowering it do? It grows the GDP.
@LaurentJean2 @hbgreenphilly @AOC No, she is bright and charming. She's just an altruistic pollyanna that doesn't know enough about politics, socialism, and world affairs. But she can fix this. I predict she'll be in Congress for her entire life (she's the new Pelosi). I just want her to mature.

@chrismayday @AOC That is a BRILLIANT suggestion!
@AOC It is apparent that you do not understand marginal tax rates. Here are the current effective tax rates:		Poorest 20%   -56%	Next 20%       -39%	Middle 20%    -15%	Next 20%         3%	Top 20%          34% 		The reason tax cuts favor the rich is because they're the only ones taxed.

@MarkYoungTruth I realized that I mixed up the County total with the District total. Nevertheless, over 100,000 registered voters didn't vote and another 125,000 eligible voters didn't register. If one out of twenty eligible Republicans that didn't vote, had, it would have made the difference.
@peaceisactive @ShadowElk @5ilence_d0g00d @paulajarvis69 @adamcbest First, I don't think we can prevent it. Second, what's wrong with our wealthiest Americans having the largest voice (if they want it)? The reason our founding fathers opposed a simple democracy is because democracies lead to majorities voting perks from the minority.
@mremmulp @cherylg25697139 As open-minded and socially liberal as I am, I must admit that I oppose Sharia Law. It contains many, many human rights abuses and is contrary to freedom, including religious freedom.

Once, I was in SF across the street from town hall. I saw four news vans show up. Then I saw a couple of vans full of people show up. Then I saw an organizer show up, open her trunk and hand out signs. Then they broadcast the protest. It's the order that changed my politics.
@olemolyee @realDonaldTrump That was a very eloquent point. I don't think I have a comeback.
Fun fact: Actors are unionized. Teachers are unionized. News people are unionized. AT&amp;T is unionized (and owns CNN). Unionization is a form of Socialism. And, each of these groups are die-hard Democrat supports. Most salaries are determined as a multiple of minimum wage.

@vjcarmosino @washingtonpost In 2016, 92.8% of voters in Washington D.C. voted for Hillary Clinton. The rest of America was about 50/50. Does that tell you anything?

By the way, Carlos Slim was the richest guy in the world for a while. Wikipedia refers to him as a "Philanthropist" which is a code word for "Evil Rich Progressive" (like Soros). Could Randall Stephenson's connection to this rich guy from Mexico have something to do with CNN?
So is it possible that the idiot that allows CNN to be CNN may be a Conservative Republican? Makes me sick to even consider what that would mean.  But, there it is, AT&amp;T is the head of the snake and Randall Stephenson is the guy in charge. Let's call him out.
According to Wikipedia, Randall Stephenson was National Chair/President of the Boy Scouts and was mentored by richest man in Mexico, Carlos Slim (@carlosslim) and was appointed to a National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee by President Bush (yeah, Bush).
