Most of all, I know my dad would've been excited about the fact that other young, ambitious daughters would have a local role model to look up to. I'm cheering on @liuba4congress today - and I know, wherever he may be, my dad is too.
If my dad were alive today, he would've been over the moon about our Amityville neighbor, Liuba, running for office. He would've knocked doors, collected Newsday clippings, and called with weekly updates about swinging our neighbors to vote for Liuba.
Today, @liuba4congress is running to represent the district I called home for 20+ years. Coincidently, #NY2 has never had a woman representative in Congress. I truly believe that is going to change today. https://t.co/CvoEp1Lvo1
Funny enough, my dad would say he didn't have a political bone in his body. As a 70's grad of School of Visual Arts, he went on to be a talented graphic designer. But he always made sure I knew my options as a young woman in politics weren't limited. He was my biggest cheerleader
I vividly remember my dad transforming my grandfather's Coast Guard footlocker into a makeshift podium so I could practice my 5th-grade version of Geraldine Ferraro's '84 stump speech in our living room.
Growing up on Long Island, my dad did everything he could to support my early interest in gov't + politics.		For 5th-grade Career Day, he went to every thrift store along the South Shore in search of the perfect red pantsuit so I could accurately channel Geraldine Ferraro.
It's #ElectionDay. And because grief has no rhyme or reason, today has made me think a lot about the person who first opened my eyes to the world of politics: My dad. https://t.co/6OF4bBMKXz
