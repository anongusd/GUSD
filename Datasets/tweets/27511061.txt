Allegations of financial fraud may seem less dramatic than some of Trump's other scandals, but		(a) the evidence really is compelling; and		(b) we're talking about possible felonies for which the statute of limitations has not expired. https://t.co/4TJCM3s2E4
I don't mean to sound picky, but didn't we recently hear your boss say he fell in love with a dictator who "violates human rights and steals from the starving"? In fact, didn't they just pal around in Hanoi? https://t.co/micvJg3ZJK
The Senate almost certainly won't pass the new gun reforms approved by the House, but this week's votes are nevertheless emblematic of a dramatically changed political landscape. https://t.co/FrIEQRXTk5

@einsteinboricua You have good timing, Dennis. I was *just* fixing that as I went for more caffeine.
If Trump utilized "madman theory" to spur talks with North Korea, he did so out of confusion: Kim Jong-un wants to be there -- and didn't need to be coerced. https://t.co/R4GxonYgsp

So, Trump sat down for talks in which he offered nothing, left when told he wouldn't get his ransom, and admitted the shutdown is over his unyielding demand for an unpopular wall? This is going to take a while. https://t.co/EcBv5u74ru
On the government shutdown, Syria, and immigration, there's a common thread: the White House doesn't appear to have any idea what it's doing. https://t.co/2W3stVhasr
To the extent that the White House had a substantive argument on immigration, it's collapsed. What's left is Trump telling people that scary immigrants are coming to kill them. https://t.co/zDFtJdmpF7
Trump has no plan. He has no new material. He has no bill. He has no facts. He has no crisis. So what was the point of his Oval Office address?		I think it's all about giving the appearance of fighting. https://t.co/IrI5BUbT5R
If there was no 2016 cooperation between Team Trump and Moscow, it was awfully odd for Trump's campaign chair to share polling data with a Russian tied to Russian intelligence -- and then lie about it. https://t.co/GvqpX3XKbC
Trump said two weeks ago that "everybody and his uncle" wants to be his Defense secretary. "Everybody wants that position. Everybody. Everybody."		It was the first big hint he was having trouble replacing Mattis. https://t.co/dYw6TqAxzI
The moral of the story: when Trump describes conversations that only happened in his imagination, he should avoid references to real people who can discredit him. https://t.co/VFauZjLEfO
Trump describes farmers hurt by his tariffs as "patriots." He describes federal workers hurt by his shutdown as "patriots."		I guess if you're lucky, he'll never the word about you? https://t.co/FT9qrMZ7nC
Asked why Trump has echoed the Kremlin's talking points, the White House chief of staff said he's "not too concerned about the details." Perhaps the rest of us should be? https://t.co/MpZfbCSm3H
1995: Gingrich shuts down govt over AF1 seating.		2008: Offended by Pelosi speech, GOP rejects economic rescue plan.		2019: Graham defends shutdown tactics: "Why would you negotiate with someone who calls you a racist?"		It's all about the GOP's feelings. https://t.co/kyVHOcueuQ
@FrankLynchBkln @ritholtz Frank, if it's helpful, here's that post:  https://t.co/DXa0ncX5e5 (The fleeting supermajority wasn't literally a month, but it was quite brief, and much shorter than many pundits and Republicans like to pretend.)
It's amazing how little sense this makes. Trump sat around over the holidays, failing to schedule meetings, failing to make offers, and failing to pick up the phone. That's not working. https://t.co/9kERaTZ8O1 https://t.co/gz9OuVAzGs
Trump envisions a model in which he can circumvent Congress and spend taxpayer money in defiance of lawmakers' wishes, all while the government takes private property.		Conservatism has seen better days. https://t.co/naT2a4nMbw
Trump has an unfortunate habit of describing imaginary conversations. For example, his presidential predecessors did not secretly endorse his plan to build a giant border wall. https://t.co/xKyUL7tYgq
Relying on Game of Thrones to make a point about the efficacy of walls is a bit like relying on Jurassic Park to make a point about the safety of genetic testing. https://t.co/TCfwZEnGPL
@AtsushiJC Doesn't everyone? (I'm kidding, of course. Officials in the West Wing, for example, apparently don't.)
Jobs created in the first 23 months of Trump's presidency: 4.57 million		Jobs created in the last 23 months of Obama's presidency: 4.82 million		Still no word from the WH on why job growth has slowed https://t.co/7hv1zz6OxA https://t.co/pppPkTHKNk
@gilroy0 Nice catch, Bernard. Thanks for the heads-up.
Job numbers by year:	2014: 3.01 million	2015: 2.69 million	2016: 2.34 million	2017: 2.19 million	2018: 2.64 million	When Trump says this is the best growth "ever," he means "in a few years" https://t.co/7hv1zz6OxA
If Trump is going to address the possibility of his impeachment, he'll first need to understand what that means. At this point, he's badly confused. https://t.co/TIYtDNfLvQ https://t.co/QDyKwPJpqk
The Republicans' shutdown strategy depends on the GOP sticking together. It's why it matters so much that cracks are beginning to emerge in the Republicans' (ahem) wall. https://t.co/hYdG0gZVAx
Unprompted, Trump thought it'd be a good idea to insult India's efforts in Afghanistan. Not surprisingly, some folks in New Delhi noticed. https://t.co/rLq6arDA0r
I always find it reassuring when the meritocracy asserts itself. @jbouie has long been one of my favorites, and @nytopinion is lucky to get him. https://t.co/tCzXeh2Dm7
To hear Trump tell it, his plan to resolve the shutdown over the holidays was to sit around for days, waiting to see if someone stopped by to negotiate with him. That's obviously pitiful, but the problem runs deeper. https://t.co/9kERaTZ8O1
Trump's bogus history lesson on the USSR's invasion of Afghanistan must've come from somewhere. It'd be awfully nice to know the source. https://t.co/K18u1x0HCO
Mike Pence really ought to be annoyed by the frequency with which Trump contradicts him. I doubt he'd ever admit it, but it seems pretty embarrassing. https://t.co/zWqJg4saS6

I had the same reaction to this as @crampell: It wasn't long ago that Trump was saying things like, "Do you think it's just luck that the stock market is climbing?"		He consistently fails to appreciate the dangers of taking credit for market changes he has no control over. https://t.co/7tiT6PHnme
Left unanswered is the question of why Trump sat around for nearly two weeks, making no effort to strike a deal, tweeting at lawmakers instead of talking to them. https://t.co/o8gN60iDiy
An evolving policy:	- Trump says, "We're not going into Syria"	- He deploys troops to Syria	- He says we're precipitously withdrawing	- Mattis, McGurk resign	- Trump doubles down on immediate withdrawal	- He "pauses" his own poorly thought out policy	It's bound to change again. https://t.co/Nligo8zvEu
That's quite a quote from a decorated four-star general. https://t.co/hxLgcxhdWq
Trump, his business, his political operation, his foundation, and his inaugural committee are all facing investigations. With this in mind, perhaps it's not too surprising that one of his golf resorts is facing investigators' scrutiny, too. https://t.co/omerlHLXQ7
He's lying (again). Dems backed compromise immigration measures, which included border security funding. Trump rejected the bipartisan deals, saying they weren't far enough to the right. https://t.co/IEQuehg4VY https://t.co/9VQqzuKIM7
Trump has had five years to come up with a compelling pitch for his signature domestic policy priority. It hasn't gone well because it can't: a wall is indefensibly foolish. https://t.co/blQYVvng02
For a guy who says he has "one of the great memories of all time," Trump occasionally forgets events from his own presidency. His immigration tweet, for example, was bizarre. https://t.co/IEQuehg4VY https://t.co/pOuNaxvRx0
The parallels between how Donald Trump's reality show operated and how his White House operates are ... unsettling. https://t.co/9Iuz9Fw7oV
Trump is constantly in search of leverage.	1. Give me a wall or I'll shut down the government!	2. Give me a wall or I'll veto Democratic bills!	3. Give me a wall or I'll close the border!		He's not a dealmaker; he's a hostage taker. https://t.co/nFmwbc0E3s
Here's what Trump doesn't remember (or what he hopes you'll forget): he was offered six bipartisan compromises on immigration last year, and he rejected each one as insufficiently conservative. https://t.co/AEScps0cxd https://t.co/pOuNaxvRx0
What will annoy Trump: losing the "most admired man" honor to Obama.		What will annoy Trump more: Obama beat him by an even wider margin than last year. https://t.co/79TdYkv1pq

- presidents can't "give out" imaginary federal contracts	- he isn't "building" the wall, no matter how many times he pretends otherwise	- it's far too late to shift blame for the shutdown	- lying about all of this on Christmas Eve is odd https://t.co/25FqHWwzW6
Trump wanted Ayers to fire Kelly. He had Kelly fire Tillerson. He had his bodyguard fire Comey. He had Pompeo force Mattis out early.		Trump loves to fire people, so long he's not doing the firing. https://t.co/hg48VHe7TQ

Trump has a way with adverbs.	He "strongly notified" law enforcement about illegal voting.	He "lightly looked at" the Moscow tower project.	He "begrudgingly signed" the last big spending bill.	Erdogan "strongly informed" him about ISIS. https://t.co/lXIhNZzvIx
So, the best-case scenario under these circumstances is that the Treasury secretary is answering a question no one asked because ... he's incompetent? Routine cluelessness would be the reassuring option here? https://t.co/Ye0g8PflAY
The government is shutdown. The administration's national security team is unraveling. New scandals are erupting.		It's against this backdrop that Trump apparently thought, "Now seems like a smart time to renew a pointless fight with a retiring GOP senator." https://t.co/PKmpGz25do
Alternatively, Trump could've simply *read* Mattis' resignation letter.		A Trump confidant said last year, "I call the president the two-minute man. The president has patience for a half-page." Mattis' letter was roughly a page and a half. https://t.co/YTFeOkwCHK
@XLProfessor Yes, and compounding the issue, annoying people like me keep pointing out all of the times he condemned "fences" during his 2016 campaign.		There's no comparable problem with "slats."
In Trump's mind, Democratic objections to the wall proposal are rooted, at least in part, in word choice, so he's trying to apply his branding expertise to fix the problem. This isn't smart. https://t.co/NEFoRCDHO5

As Trump's national security team unravels, the government prepares to shutdown, the stock market has its worst December since the 1930s, Putin celebrates the Syria news, and the Mueller probe intensifies, I'm wondering if Trump has made America great again.

For most of American history, government shutdowns - even threats of shutdowns - weren't a credible option. Then Republicans began the era of self-imposed crises. https://t.co/bP53SsyPTy
Why would Trump give Putin what he wants in Syria, while saying Russia is "not happy" with the decision?		Maybe Trump is confused. Or maybe he has some other motivation for trying to please Moscow. https://t.co/2q9bbsxwSS
A coherent foreign policy is rooted in a deliberate decision-making process. On Syria, Trump prefers post-policy governing, impetuously blurting out a vague directive in a tweet. https://t.co/n0j8xiod4I

"I have many, many companies moving back into the United States.  They’re opening up car plants.  They’re opening up factories all over the country." Donald Trump, four days ago, peddling fiction. https://t.co/zEmFKcyrsp
On Thanksgiving, Trump reemphasized his preoccupation with the Coast Guard's "brand." It's worth asking why in the world he keeps talking about this. https://t.co/oAnfWAKpku
Either (a) the chairman of the Judiciary Committee doesn't understand the difference between criticizing a ruling and criticizing the federal courts, or (b) he doesn't care and just wants to provide cover for Trump. Both options are disheartening. https://t.co/2RP9noEU1y
John Roberts didn't just want to rebuke Donald Trump's rhetoric about the judiciary; Roberts wanted *everyone to know* he was rebuking Trump's rhetoric. https://t.co/IOOPfVzeZR

Yesterday, Trump positioned himself as an apologist for Saudi Arabia. Today, he's taking the next step: *thanking* Saudi Arabia. Reminds me a bit of the time thanked Putin after Russia expelled US diplomats. https://t.co/iDZfLSqww7 https://t.co/VQDljVcg3O
The CIA hoped to force Trump's hand on Saudi Arabia, putting him in a position where he'd have no choice but to be responsible. His crazypants statement shows that the plan didn't work. https://t.co/JNeU9GaRbK

Trump believes Georgia's gubernatorial race was "stacked against" Brian Kemp. It's important to understand that this is the exact opposite of reality. https://t.co/7ZZqaKVGkR
Trump's shots at McRaven are the McCain/POW moment all over again: Trump limits his praise to soldiers who weren't captured, and his respect for four-star admirals is conditional on whether they say nice things about him. https://t.co/VLUpWpImoJ
Asked about retired Navy Admiral McRaven three months ago, Trump said, "I don't know McRaven." https://t.co/8Izp0aXk8J Apparently he knows him now, but not as well as he should. https://t.co/aZUqZQZZ8T
The "by design" angle is such an important point. The problem in Georgia was not one of neglect or incompetence; it was a deliberate campaign, hatched to achieve a specific partisan goal. https://t.co/h7B9dzD9Dd
And taking this one step further, the Dems' 2018 advantage, which may yet inch higher, is better than the GOP's advantage in the 1994 and 2010 midterms - both of which are seen as "wave" cycles for Republicans. https://t.co/lPDKHnSfhv

On a related note, if he is talking about the indexing of capital gains, the beneficiaries would be the wealthy, not the middle class. This could be done without Congress.

Trump said last week that women "are very angry" over the way Kavanaugh has been treated. New polling suggests he has this backwards. https://t.co/znUHXyWgcp
Trump does not care about the substance of public policy. He cares deeply, however, about what policies are called. This is about the new NAFTA -- but that's not all it's about. https://t.co/4I1I0ZTRPh
Kavanaugh told Fox News last week that if the incident with Deborah Ramirez had occurred, "it would’ve been the talk of campus." What if it was? https://t.co/lD2NZW05i5

@RitaHisgenBoone Thanks, Rita, for letting me know.
@ABeckr While also simultaneously glossing over the fact the same people making that argument ignored the consequences of the 2012 election (Obama won, nominated Garland, whose nomination withered on the vine for a year.)
@DrJHaulsee I don't know for sure, but I'm reasonably certain the online C-SPAN, at a minimum, will air it.
Lindsey Graham described the American Bar Association yesterday as "the gold standard." Hours later, the ABA told Republicans what they didn't want to hear. https://t.co/bk06W3YxFV
There have long been concerns about Brett Kavanaugh's role as a partisan warrior. Those concerns are vastly more difficult to ignore now. https://t.co/4i6ISxVoZJ
Last week, Trump said when weighing whether to confirm Kavanaugh, there "shouldn't even be a little doubt." That may not have been the ideal standard for him to set.
Kavanaugh, today: "A democratic senator on this committee publicly referred to me as evil. 'Evil.' Think about that word."		Trump, yesterday: Criticism of Kavanaugh is "being perpetuated by some very evil people -- some of them are Democrats, I must say."
I'm not sure he meant it, but this Trump quote from last week keeps coming to mind: "Look, if she shows up and makes a credible showing, that'll be very interesting, and we'll have to make a decision."
At some point today, Kavanaugh will likely ask senators to trust him. His credibility problems - which predate the sexual-misconduct allegations - will make that very difficult. https://t.co/P2OU1oX4dZ
Nikki Haley accusing John Kerry of "anti-American" activities was bizarre. Her insistence that world leaders love Trump's honesty was just as tough to understand. https://t.co/RzAejj2UGz

There's a government-shutdown deadline in six days, and no one's sure what'll happen. That's probably not anywhere close to the top 10 most notable political stories unfolding right now.

It took a while, but Jeff Flake may be ready to use his leverage and block Trump's judicial nominees. If he's serious - a big "if" - this is a gambit with real potential https://t.co/r4YggB1mST

@HaikBedrosian That's a throwback reply, Haik!
Details he probably should've mentioned: Trump didn't invite any congressional Dems to today's White House meeting on immigration, and House Dems were locked out of recent immigration negotiations. https://t.co/xWFpP3gDhU

Following Lewandowski's cruel indifference toward a young immigrant girl with special needs, let's not pretend he's a peripheral figure. He's clearly a central player in Trump World https://t.co/GDJ2Nnyz1k
Seeking presidential leadership on immigration, congressional Republicans asked Trump to make things better. Last night, he made things worse https://t.co/GmLYeQctLs
When Obama met with House Republicans, he was willing to take plenty of questions and engaged in a lengthy Q&amp;A. What was Trump afraid of? https://t.co/HRowbTt6QH

So, we've reached the "it depends on your meaning of 'cage'" point in this fight? https://t.co/olwmNYfzVY
Trump's point this morning wasn't subtle: lying in a written statement to a major news organization isn't necessarily wrong. As it happens, there's a Watergate precedent on this https://t.co/gnMi9puIwJ
Trump falsely claimed the Justice Dept's IG has fully "exonerated" him in the Russia scandal. Even by 2018 standards, the gaslighting is breathtaking https://t.co/pSHnHzOM9p

If Trump genuinely believes the North Korean nuclear threat is over, and the rogue nuclear power is "no longer" a problem, his ignorance may actually be dangerous https://t.co/HUBQkWTbuj
Why would Trump say NK is going to start denuclearizing "now"?	- Maybe he believes nonsense	- Maybe KJU fooled him into believing nonsense	- Maybe he made up the nonsense https://t.co/HexG1vvDzS

There are over 600 key positions in the executive branch that require Senate confirmation, and as of today, Trump hasn't even nominated anyone for more than 200 of those posts. That's not Dems' fault. https://t.co/8RxGTeKYK7
Flake playing games with the Bridenstine/NASA vote was annoying, but routine. Rubio, however, who was against Bridenstine before he was for him, is in a tougher-to-defend spot https://t.co/ue8w6OJG2A
After claiming human trafficking has reached an all-time high, Trump added, "Who would think in this modern-day age?" It's as if part of him almost understood how wrong he was https://t.co/xgv0lasymA
Mike Pence boasted last year that the world sees Trump as "a leader who says what he means and means what he says." In hindsight, that's not a quote that holds up well https://t.co/ZpdW7ZQoPK
Trump told the American Farm Bureau in Jan., "Oh are you happy you voted for me. You are so lucky that I gave you that privilege." His message to farmers has since taken a turn for the worse https://t.co/RZ4aS3MVgq
Given Trump's actual record toward Russia, perhaps he has some unusual definition of "tough" he hasn't yet shared with the rest of us https://t.co/OvpJyal6nf https://t.co/h0sroVYMbs
Paul Ryan said he's impressed with Trump's "toughness" toward Russia. Maybe he didn't understand the question https://t.co/OvpJyal6nf
TPP, guns, immigration, health care -- at a certain point, shouldn't policymakers just stop showing up for meetings with Trump? https://t.co/W7I2HwJkYE
It's worth pausing to appreciate the sheer volume of controversies surrounding Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke that have broken over the last month or so https://t.co/mAlOOd8hEB

The number of instances in which Trump and Haley appear to be working for entirely different teams keeps growing https://t.co/rQxDLaHu1Q
Trump was forced to cut a $25 million check to Americans who credibly accused him of perpetrating a fraud - and that was maybe the 14th biggest scandal he faced last week https://t.co/d7YJQ8MQRu
Following strikes in Syria, Trump had an incentive to show the world he's approaching his responsibilities with sober maturity. Instead, he did the opposite https://t.co/72Urvmii3H
As of right now, yes, though Wynn and Broidy are out -- and the RNC isn't returning any of their money https://t.co/c48BnaTaKb https://t.co/wLKd3QVHpx
1. For Trump to believe McCabe lied, he has to believe Comey told the truth	2. If Trump's concerned about lying to the FBI, why pardon Libby?	3. @PressSec in Nov 2016: "When you're attacking FBI agents because you're under criminal investigation, you're losing" https://t.co/x7EcE8mYtD
The funny thing is, Elliott Broidy was *already* controversial before he was forced to resign as an RNC finance chair today https://t.co/c48BnaTaKb
The presidential pardon authority is not supposed to be an instrument of political messaging. And yet, here we are https://t.co/74MtvHz4yy
@drewhuntre Yeah, I kind of get that feeling.
Politico report on Monday: "There is no [anti-Comey] blitz attack planned by the White House, which would be seen as 'punching down.'" The White House's plan did not, however, account for Trump's lack of impulse control https://t.co/nF3XTDQb0d
@sayfancygroovy I'm certain you're confusing me with someone else. I haven't been on the air in months, and I haven't discussed military options online or off. I also opposed the Iraq invasion in 2003. Good luck.
On the other hand, I seem to recall Paul Ryan taking an interest in a Pennsylvania secretary who's getting an extra $1.50 in her paycheck. So I guess the wealth is being spread around? https://t.co/SQHqaRxf2z
Trump has reportedly been seeking legal advice from "virtually any attorney who calls him up." He may not realize why this is such a bad idea https://t.co/IbsCCESkUp
On the one hand, Ryan is telling his members they'll be fine. On the other hand, he's saying this while shoving his stuff in a suitcase with a plane ticket sticking out of his jacket pocket https://t.co/q5o3901hak

NBC News, citing several law enforcement officials, reports that the search of Cohen's office was not the work of Mueller's prosecutors. It's apparently related to Cohen's payments to Stormy Daniels.
A statement from Cohen's lawyer reads in part, "I have been advised by federal prosecutors that the New York action is, in part, a referral by the Office of Special Counsel, Robert Mueller."

.@JohnJHarwood did a great job with this. It's worth your time. https://t.co/JBUiVjcJTP
@chesstourist @GreatDismal For a senior adviser to the president, with an expansive policy portfolio that includes overseeing the negotiations for the Middle East peace process, 38 is, in fact, young.
Is it just me or is it unsettling when an erratic amateur president launches a trade war, without a policy review, while feeling overwhelmed by scandals and White House chaos? https://t.co/W6azikosUT
How brutal are Jared Kushner's scandals? The loss of his White House security clearance is maybe the fourth worst thing to happen to him this week https://t.co/Q82LXOXqS0
@CastIrony Good point.
The ease with which Trump responds to complex problems with "It's easy!" says a great deal about his presidency https://t.co/xsLwNK6wE5
I wonder if Pence ever gets tired of Trump contradicting him in public. It seems like the sort of thing that would get annoying https://t.co/5TjoxIMvBK
On the NRA, Trump told senators this week, "They have great power over you people. They have less power over me." Yeah, about that... https://t.co/680etcPR7q
Problem #1: Trump has no meaningful understanding of what a trade deficit is.	Problem #2: It's never a good sign when he addresses complex issues by saying, "It's easy!" https://t.co/pTfBNykdtK
Hatch during Jeff Sessions' confirmation debate: "We have to treat each other with respect or this place is going to devolve into a jungle." Sessions' critics "ought to be ashamed," he said, of using harsh rhetoric https://t.co/Nzo1MuCEln https://t.co/5zd7cNNyDL
The more Trump faces legal jeopardy, the more Republican politics changes its posture toward law enforcement https://t.co/OXhcLjGGAy
When Trump said he likes the sound of a "comprehensive" gun bill, he was being quite literal: he likes *branding labels*. It's the prism though which he sees every issue https://t.co/34ZAKQoQlu
Yesterday brought a core truth into focus: there's no practical reason to have policy discussions with Trump on any issue. He simply doesn't know or care what he's talking about. https://t.co/V8V0lnNhHJ
Trump's WH Comm Directors:	- Jason Miller, quit before inauguration	- Sean Spicer, split time with press sec gig for about a month	- Mike Dubke, quit after 3 months	- Scaramucci, gone after 11 days	- Hope Hicks, now leaving
This is painfully, obviously true, but let's also be clear that Trump called this meeting, he had plenty of time to prepare, and he could've gotten up to speed on the basics of the debate. He simply chose not to. https://t.co/OPMu0fPFUW
Today, Trump seems to have no idea that Obama pushed for expanded background checks in 2013. But Trump not only knew it at the time, he also used it to push not-so-subtle birther nonsense https://t.co/k6kL1N3Oyh
Jeff Sessions keeps looking for ways to make Donald Trump happy. It's not going well https://t.co/xdzOMh8UTd

@jaybookmanajc I think about this every time I see Rubio adopt his faux reasonable-guy posture.

Trump's EPA chief, Scott Pruitt, apparently believes the Bible helps justify his far-right approach to environmental policy. That's ... unsettling https://t.co/6LdA8SwabA
With each new guilty plea and indictment against people from his team, Trump's pitch as a "law and order" president gets a little more ridiculous https://t.co/Bs2x9JRcNd

If Trump really wants to have this conversation, maybe we can start with the step Obama wanted to take, before Mitch McConnell rejected it for reasons he hasn't yet explained https://t.co/nJYRYImidv https://t.co/iv17MRL5tE
He imposed sanctions on Russia after the election.		You're president now. What'd you do about Russian interference -- other than fail to impose sanctions? https://t.co/iv17MRL5tE
There's renewed interest in Mitch McConnell's apparent negligence during the Russian attack on the 2016 elections. The scrutiny seems overdue https://t.co/nJYRYImidv
Trump wants you to believe a foreign adversary's sophisticated and well-funded intelligence operation was inconsequential. There's no reason you should believe him https://t.co/haD6Ol38EU
Trump has said that when he's attacked, he always hits back "10 times harder." But when we're attacked, it's apparently a very different story https://t.co/NaM0GMIY0P
After 18 hours of hysterical presidential tweeting, the number of times Trump has vowed to keep us safe from the adversary that launched a sophisticated attack on the United States: zero. I wonder why that is
I should know better than to be surprised, but for a president to exploit the death of children, in the hopes of undermining an FBI investigation into himself, represents a new level of depravity https://t.co/aEYPbU8J9c

I can't remember who said it, but on Monday, I saw someone tweet that by today, no one would remember it's Infrastructure Week. Whoever you are, take a bow
As recently as November, Donald Trump made the case that Russia didn't "meddle" in the election. Now, he's grudgingly acknowledging reality - in a clumsy way https://t.co/NjsODwQ3QX
Something @brianbeutler said in Dec seems even more true today: "If the [Russia] story were to end where we are right now, with no further confessions or indictments or revelations, it would still amount to the biggest scandal" in US political history https://t.co/1YRBAWUll3
For two years, Trump has balked at the idea that Russians tried to help elect him. He's insisted it's a "hoax." I know he's not much of a reader, but someone should show him this indictment. https://t.co/qimddzwJs4

The funny thing is, Democrats never seemed to worry when Obama would meet with Republicans. What do you suppose the GOP's anxiety today says about their confidence in Trump's competence? https://t.co/FbtXqEm9rC
Self-imposed political crises have persisted since 2011, but we shouldn't accept the routinization of shutdown politics as a new normal https://t.co/3gocCicB0Q
"The right guy would get everybody into a room and would make a deal," Trump said during the 2013 budget fight that led to a shutdown https://t.co/ckVbfWhC4p
As it happens, back in 2016, China used Trump's rise in Republican politics as evidence of democracy's flaws https://t.co/YmHSbUri94 State-run media described him at the time as an "abusively racist and extremist" candidate https://t.co/qGO7wM4NVB
Trump's lawyer said the Russia probe would wrap up by Thanksgiving. Then it was Dec. 31. Make that Jan. 31. Now the prediction is March 31? https://t.co/fgLhEMivaT
Trump in 2017: "We're not going into Syria"	Tillerson in 2018: We're not leaving Syria	https://t.co/vrjyzLqiLa

John Kelly to Dems: Trump's "evolved" on immigration since campaign	Trump to Reuters: My campaign promises on immigration are paramount	https://t.co/RJVatlA4TR
Substantively, this quote from Trump's Reuters interview is absurd in a variety of important ways, but it's also Trump at his most Trumpian https://t.co/Rt6rXIFdcY
Jeff Flake's public criticisms of Trump are welcome. If he were willing to take steps beyond nice speeches, that'd be even better https://t.co/dm1yYDOSB6

Taking a step back, it's worth appreciating how ridiculous - and exhausting - Trump has made the first two weeks of 2018 https://t.co/6x5TdMIz5x
To defend Trump after the "shithole countries" controversy, Republicans needed an alternative villain. They apparently settled on Dick Durbin https://t.co/W2xzJ1VHHC
On DACA, Trump is trying to pull off an amazing scam: (1) create the problem; (2) reject bipartisan solutions; (3) blame everyone else https://t.co/Kf8zZ1blZ0

Sarah Huckabee Sanders recently said Americans shouldn't see Trump's White House as "racially charged." So much for that idea https://t.co/oz0hi1sNiQ

There's a not-so-subtle pattern to Trump's self-aggrandizing rhetoric https://t.co/FKHrKa93RY https://t.co/OftbXxvIBU

Trump had an opportunity yesterday to prove he has a substantive vision for farmers and rural America. He blew it https://t.co/p4GXCxM2sR
Trump strayed from his teleprompter to tell farmers, "Oh, are you happy you voted for me. You are so lucky that I gave you that privilege."		I'm trying to imagine the reaction if Obama said something like this. https://t.co/xcTNN0qg6T
According to Lindsey Graham, Trump now believes Russia interfered with the US elections. If Graham's right, that's a dramatic presidential shift https://t.co/reMXPTVyZz

What I find especially notable about this is Trump’s I-know-you-are-but-what-am-I instincts. It's part of an amazing pattern  https://t.co/4juURIWlcn https://t.co/zhMe9K3fwJ
@SimonMaloy It reminds me a lot of one of the opening scenes in Office Space  https://t.co/tb6v1N1ysd
Trump, moments ago: "This is a country which I don't want to look foolish and it's not going to look foolish as long as I'm here."		No, seriously, that's what he said.
This is part of an unmistakable pattern: the more Trump appears to be flailing, the more his Senate Republican skeptics link arms with him https://t.co/GlPyJmxav1 https://t.co/TJQpuFcbEZ
Job growth wasn't bad in Trump's 1st year in office, but it did slow to a six-year low. Job totals by year:	2011: 1.84m	2012: 2.19m	2013: 2.33m	2014: 3.11m	2015: 2.74m	2016: 2.24m	2017: 2.05m	https://t.co/E8dQJwfiRi

@AliABCNews @AlexKoppelman Thanks, Ali, I appreciate that.
@AliABCNews @AlexKoppelman I think it's also fair to say, while Hatch said he supports CHIP, he also said "we don’t have money" to pay for it. This came while he argued that we can afford $1.5 trillion in tax cuts https://t.co/EMpzuL4Pth
@lenburman @haroldpollack @JustinWolfers Not exactly. I provided the context: Hatch said he supports CHIP, but added "we don’t have money" to pay for it. He does, however, believe we can afford $1.5 trillion in tax cuts https://t.co/EMpzuL4Pth

As Trumpcare falls, it's refreshing to see the rules of American politics work the way they're supposed to https://t.co/SpBWNVJdKA
Somebody at the White House really ought to tell Trump he's not supposed to say stuff like this out loud https://t.co/UQICb6nz8H https://t.co/ADKgn6oNcd
217 House Republicans voted for an unpopular &amp; regressive health care plan. What do they have to show for it now? https://t.co/nLSTEZl6gB
John Cornyn is, of course, the Senate Majority Whip, which means he's responsible for counting and corralling votes. #youhadonejob https://t.co/XyJ4ySsOyl
Trump doesn't understand "why legislators don't listen to him." Perhaps because he has so little of value to say? https://t.co/PY6TC3kysf
There's a difference between the Republican health care bill &amp; the Republican repeal crusade. One's dead, one's not https://t.co/yQxe7Pd9XC

Excellent piece. "Republicans and Trump are fast becoming of one mind that the Russian subversion campaign was useful...." https://t.co/rboSq4iqm9
I don't expect much from Sean Spicer, but his "discussion about adoption" line about the Russia meeting was bizarre https://t.co/v6VGMAMgL9
He seems to have no idea that his new line on the Russia meeting is at odds with his old line (from just last week) https://t.co/lquoesig0e https://t.co/YZ2yagkUkl

We've grown accustomed to Mike Pence lying about the Russia scandal, but he lies a lot about health care, too https://t.co/UxlSQwcwDU

The latest WH pitch: in order for collusion with a Russian espionage operation to matter, it has to be "sustained" https://t.co/xA2GnadGSP

@JohnJHarwood Admittedly, the difference is subtle -- kind of like the president's vow that "everybody" will be covered by his party's health care plan.

@michaelkapp True, true. I was hoping to emphasize the idea, however, that a former AG seeking national office isn't entirely without precedent.
In April, Trump vowed, "We're not going into Syria." Now seems like an excellent time to revisit that promise https://t.co/DO6qCw44Fw
The ability to govern Mitch McConnell's way isn't new.	The willingness to govern this way *is* new	https://t.co/mB8tVJBONN
Or are Republicans simply pushing an unpopular bill now, because they can, hoping that support somehow materializes later?
I'm genuinely curious: is there a groundswell of support on the right for the GOP's health care gambit that I'm missing?
The Republican gambit may indeed seem "crazy," but the underlying point is true, whether Cornyn likes it or not https://t.co/BpVocOPaYn https://t.co/qwRiaRlkLX

FBI's James Comey to Congress: Never mind; Clinton's in the clear; the last nine days were for naught. #youvegottobekiddingme https://t.co/joUr3v2R49
@pklinkne Yes, but if that were the only problem, I'd let it go without mention. Ryan's "plan" actually goes much further.
Curious if the Speaker realizes how ridiculous his anti-poverty plan really is https://t.co/7cuLf2bH9G Does he assume no one's read it? https://t.co/RhASkhMyoU
Keep in mind, no Dem presidential candidate has won college-educated whites since the dawn of modern polling in the '50s. HRC would be 1st. https://t.co/N7QC2eLD9R

The funny thing is, 24 hours later, Comey is facing allegations of wrongdoing - and Clinton isn't. Not what many would've guessed yesterday. https://t.co/BTUk4HjKIB
Quite right. Details suggest there's no real controversy here but voters are being told the opposite with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer https://t.co/f7lccvyRh7
Remember, voters find important what they're told to care about. Political world said, "Care about email server management!" Folks listened. https://t.co/115nuDsLXg
Yep, not only are there no new allegations of wrongdoing, there may not even be new emails. "Controversy" based on messages FBI hasn't read. https://t.co/AAWBoINrtC
Worth clarifying: "new apology" implies some kind of guilt, but nothing emerged today that points to any HRC wrongdoing. Literally, nothing. https://t.co/2E1AAFlfFG

By stressing Iraq &amp; NAFTA, Trump seems to be talking himself out of adding Pence to the ticket - while introducing him as his running mate
"Back to Mike Pence," says the guy who apparently forgot the point of this speech -- and who then transitioned to content unrelated to Pence
Trump does realize Pence was an unrepentant Iraq-war cheerleader, right? Surely someone told the candidate about this, yes?
I've been thinking the same. Could T even find Turkey on a map - w/ labels? What happens if he "reacts emotionally"? https://t.co/ImLS5ZAsjH
