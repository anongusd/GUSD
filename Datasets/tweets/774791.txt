To any publishers reading this, yes, we need more children's and teen books by indigenous creators. But we also need books on all topics for all ages. Business books? Yes. Health and wellness books, yes. Think of any topic, our patrons want books by indigenous creators.

Correction: typed East, which is incorrect. Apologies!
@lrsimeon Ah, thank you for that correction! My error.
@BookSodtah Yeah. I was disappointed that they were so blunt. I suggested that indigenous folks write about all kinds of things, and she looked at me like my head was on fire.
I am seeing reports of harassment that happened here and am working on scripts for myself to have ready so I don't freeze and be a bystander. Fellow White library workers, let's work on what action we can take - happy to hear about what y'all are doing #alamw19 7/
All of this is to say, White supremacy is thriving and many of the exhibitors at #alamw19 appear to be fine with being part of that. Now I'm working on a strategy to try to continue this throughout the year. 6/
For those who had one title or none, I asked what marginalized voices they did have. Saw more lgbtqia voices than last year, but still mostly White creators by far 5/
Two publishers immediately responded with, to quote one of them, "that's not us." When I expressed surprise she said that they publish books on health and wellness, which apparently she thinks indigenous people can't/won't/don't write 4/
Many didn't know what the word indigenous meant and asked me to define it. 3/
A few apologized and said they know it's something they need to work on. One directed me to a book by an East Asian Indian author, seemingly unaware that American Indian is different. 2/
This year again at #alamw19 I asked each publisher what they had by indigenous creators. The majority had one title or one coming in a year or more. Too many just froze and then said they had nothing. 1/

I also want to say that I'm doing my best in this job but I'm never going to be the right person for it - that would be a member of this Tribe. We all know that librarianship as a profession has a huge Whiteness problem - this is part of it #critlib
@akaur0 @violetbfox I'd say, look for opportunities to learn, be mindful of the constraints that library staff may have, try not to make assumptions that things will work the same as they do in other libraries - be open, I guess #critlib
@violetbfox @akaur0 my pleasure! I'm learning every day myself and always want to help others be informed #critlib
@violetbfox yes! it is so important! Tribal libraries like mine rely heavily on funding from federal sources (IMLS, etc) #critlib
@violetbfox @akaur0 I've done in-person presentations at conferences and in education classes at the nearby university, so far. Also happy to chat with folks to answer questions or whatever is useful #critlib
@violetbfox @akaur0 we also are open to everyone at the public and college locations - anyone can get a library card and use our services, spaces, and collections - so I try to get the word out about that, esp to nearby who are not served by any tax-funded public library #critlib
@violetbfox @akaur0 this also translates to advocacy - I'm in the midst of working with folks at the state level to ensure that the (public) Tribal Library is eligible for e-rate #critlib
@violetbfox @akaur0 definitely - a goal for me personally as a library professional but also a goal that has been articulated to me by the folks I work with. At their request I have started to present more and try to share information to raise awareness #critlib
@akaur0 @violetbfox I had lived in the nearby town for 15 years earlier in my life, so I was somewhat familiar but not as much as I should have been considering. I have learned a lot and continue to learn every day #critlib
@violetbfox there are a lot of great public services here for tribal members and descendants - the Tribal Libs cooperate heavily with other Tribal Ops departments! #critlib
One thing I'd say that folks may not realize about Tribal Libraries is that they are all unique. There are nearly 600 federally recognized tribes in the US and each one is a sovereign nation, so there's no one way things are #critlib
@akaur0 @violetbfox my service ethic is still front and center, and being that the community is relatively small, I get to know people much better than in the larger libs I've worked in #critlib
@akaur0 @violetbfox it was mostly a matter of determining expectations and learning about how things work in Tribal Operations here - I've mostly worked in libraries that are not part of a municipality before, so those were more independent to some degree #critlib
@violetbfox our regular funding is substantially less than most of the neighboring public libraries and we have less staff (just three of us, myself and two library assistants, to cover three libraries) #critlib
@violetbfox we are funded by the Tribe - not dissimilar from how a municipal library is funded by the municipality, except that money does not come from taxes. We rely heavily on grants (I am also responsible for writing those), so that part of it varies highly. #critlib
@violetbfox I've been here for 4+ years, previously worked in public and community college libraries for about 15 years before that #critlib
@violetbfox our public Tribal Library provides all the same services as the nearby public libs we cooperate with (we share a catalog and variety of associated services), we're just a lot smaller than most of them #critlib
@violetbfox that depends! :) I am responsible for three libs- 1 public, 1 college, 1 preK-6 school. Tribal population total is &lt;4000, in this area &lt;2000, but we also serve 3800+ employees of the Tribe and surrounding community #critlib
@violetbfox no worries! I feel like a lot of folks I meet don't really know what Tribal Libraries are. Not sure if there's anything someone would like to know? Definitely broadband is a real issue and the digital divide is super real (a lot of folks seem tofeel like it's been fixed) #critlib
