@LATbermudez To be honest, I've never attempted to cross over and learn. I low-key get a satisfaction out of hand washing dishes. I'm big on nostalgia, so the sound of water running and dishes clanking is like smelling dad's Old Spice.
@LATbermudez It's imprinted on my brother and I. We don't know how to use 'em and hand wash all our dishes.
@LATbermudez She's never used it. I don't recall her ever giving me a straight answer about why we never used it. Before the new one, we had a dishwasher for nearly 20 years and maybe used it for one week. I think she found it to be more trouble than it's worth.
@LATbermudez My mom remodeled her kitchen and installed a new dishwasher several years ago. The plastic seal covering the display and buttons may still be on there. Right now, the handle is used to tie off a trash bag to collect recyclables.
