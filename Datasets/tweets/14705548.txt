@stuartdavis @breetheauthor Has it really been almost 20 yrs since I danced like a fool at Mainly Lou's in Cedar Falls? Also cassettes. Heh.
@BeatriceMarie Squee! I watched the video yesterday, and the smoldering made me all nostalgic.
So when you order gifts from @zulily in early Dec, 'guaranteed xmas shipping' means by the 24th. I guess thats by xmas. Technically. Ugh
RT @hayeslady: Can't imagine waking up without my kids today. Lets never stop this gun control conversation until something is done.
Haven't been on twitter in ages. Every now &amp; again, I log on and am completely overwhelmed by the changes. And the rampant re-tweeting.
@BeatriceMarie @abcfBunheads Paris Gellar, squee! Now is the time where I admit I STILL have not seen the last season of GG. Big fail.
@BeatriceMarie Oh no! Maybe the bestest people are saved for last? Or you have work to do&amp; can't waste the afternoon skimming. #skimmingnow
@BeatriceMarie I know, crazy! It took me a second to figure out who he was. Good on him! It made me miss Paris Gellar a little.
Well hello, Twitter. It's been a while. I see you've survived without me. Weird. I just assumed you'd fall apart. #egocentricmuch?
@lrafdal I haven't logged onto twitter in months, and only something as awesome as Ron Effing Swanson could bring me back. Thanks!
@MEdwards78 That great, but how do you feel about cornbread?
The @theTodayShow should change it's name to "The Pretty White Ladies Are Missing News Show."
Had a dream I wrote a bunch of super funny tweets. Now that I know that didn't actually happen, really wish I could remember & rewrite them.
@pimming @jguyton77 'Tis true. We definitely share the part of the brain that contains pop culture nerdery. And we have impeccable taste.
@EWFrontRow @NoReservations I really need to be Mr. Bourdain's traveling assistant. Who can make this happen?
So, gmail isn't letting me log into both my work acct and personal acct at the same time. This is a new thing I guess? What's the deal?
@mkeller10 On the news this morning they said there are power lines down blocking the road.
@nathantwright OF COURSE! You may also discuss GI Joe.
@nathantwright You should come out for a very important beer & patio crew meeting. Only probably inside cuz the heat makes me sad & melty.
Can the office cookout start now? I'd like to eat deviled eggs.
Is @8035 doing fireworks this year?
@lrafdal ugh, I know. Dumb. But great view of the stage. #upside?
Got seated in the way back row at @DougBenson. great view but nametag's gonna be too small to see.
We're still making nametags for @DougBenson tonight, right @mkeller10  & @lrafdal? Don't wanna be a nerd alone!
Wet Hot American Summer *and* @WTFpod all in one issue? Well played @ew . You made a nerdy comedy loving girl's Friday night.
Tickets for @DougBenson 's Des Moines show purchased! Now, to craft the most amazing name tag ever. #totallygonnawaittilthelastminute
@edeniowa @headandtheheart Agreed! I expected them to be good, but they were so. Damn. Good. Loved the bouncy energy. Heart.
Wow! Line out the door street level for Iron and Wine.

@lrafdal @DougBenson Squee! Did he say when he's coming? I promised to provide bacon wrapped tater tots when he visits. #wannaplaymaltingame

@shopdomestica @porkrind @brendasuewegner @sewzinski Mmm. Cheese. It's I had for dinner last night too. But mine had rosemary, not baby head
@midwestspitfire Tasty Coma Wife was the worst. Except for that time she did the Rerun dance with her family.
@susanlu His delusions of grandeur are WTF indeed. I'd sympathize w/ the guy a little if he wasn't so far up his own ass.

@DIRECTVService I already spent half hour on phone, they said the issue was my tv. I find that suspect. No problems before hd box change.
So, I upgrade to a new HD @DIRECTV receiver and the picture quality is worse than the old one. And they're saying its my tv's fault?

Signs you're having a bad night of sleep: between waking up a million times, you dream about how tired you are.
@lrafdal Ugh. The taste. Cannot deal with a whole bottle.
Cheap wine: keeps you from accidentally drinking the whole bottle.
I scored 7029 points playing #QRANK. Can you beat that? http://bit.ly/b8lZZu

@sewzinski A dude working in a cool Chicago shop lost his shit over my wallet. He's obsessed w/ dinos & his fave food group is cheese.
@lennykoggins Pretty sure playing later in the day wouldn't have helped you at all. And really, nobody's favorite color is blue, is it?
@lennykoggins Haha! I noticed that. I mostly just did a lot of lucky guessing. And I'm always thrilled to beat @mkeller10! By almost double!
@alexson @sewzinski Exactly! The 'people say I'm an individual,' is the worst. 'I'm not an individual, I'm mass produced shiny mall clothes!
Chances are, if you consider yourself 'So Chicos,' we're not going to get along. #worstcommercialsever
Great round of @QRANK today. Though somehow I got "what's your favorite color?" wrong. Malkovitch! saved me.
@Puppetguy I'm not sure, but what a way to start the day! Hopefully it's Chim-Chimeny!
Heading back to DeMo from Chicago. Hanging out with my podcast boyfriend @nerdist
@BeatriceMarie Ha! Well played, m'lady.
Just heard a Sia song. Damn I miss Six Feet Under.
Chicago bound!
@lennykoggins If I only lose by 100 pts, I call it a win.
I have a feeling that playing iphone scrabble against me is much like playing against a puppy. @lennykoggins can confirm.
Needle drop songs have the most generic names: Standing Tall. And now the Perfect Strangers theme is in my head. Right where it should be.
Love your twitter handle, @pimming. Sounds so British. And makes me thirsty for a citrusy cocktail. Though most things do.
@DougBenson Someday someone'll be jazzed abt finding a handsfree booze glass in your old crap. Or bottles of Hamms. #mygrannywasahoarder
Today my hair is shorter and redder.
And that's how you deliver a company message. In 42 takes. #goaheadandusetheprompter
Welch's grape soda tastes like spring.
@BeatriceMarie I didn't notice that. But it was 'healthy' food, so that's okay, right? Also healthy...I had a cake pop for breakfast. Yum!
Enjoying drinks and healthy food and great conversation with the lovely @BeatriceMarie

@lennykoggins It's on vh1 classic all the time.
The British show Misfits is the best thing to happen to my lunch hour in forevs.
@bknips I haven't bought tickets yet either, but am leaning towards it. I love these little nerd nights. #heartnpr
And it was sublime. R/T @morocca Tonight in Iowa I did a 1-handed cartwheel w/ a glass of water in free hand & didn't spill drop.
@bknips I think we must have been two of 30 people under the age of 50 :) Are you going to Ira Glass?
Got my nerd on tonight with some of the @waitwait crew! Thanks for visiting the land of monkeys & insurance, @petersagal & @MoRocca!
@DougBenson No DLM plopping on my birthday? I do not approve. Now you definitely need to bring it to Des Moines. #youtotallyoweme
Yeah, Charlie Sheen is totally sober.
Thanks, twitter and tweeps I follow, for making the Oscars watchable. You should host next year instead of these fools.
Now I kinda want the Social Network to win since Fincher didn't.
Dry wit, a British accent, Mr. Darcy and that tux. I need more Colin Firth in my life.
Colin Firth is dreamy.
@CassidyFletcher Helloooo Andrew Garfield....
Seriously you guys. Annette. Bening. She really needs to win.
I effing adore Annette Bening.
I loved the King's Speech and hope it wins best pic, but I really wanted Fichner to take this one.
That dress is killing my lady crush on Kathryn Bigelow.
@susanlu Wow! That's awesome.
I may or may not watch Tarantino films and mourn the loss of Sally Menke every other time I get drunk. #ido
@susanlu I had completely forgotten Dede Allen died this year. Between her and Sally, big loss for lady editors.
@CassidyFletcher Ha! Nice.
Glad they're not broadcasting audience clapping. Always makes it seem like a popularity contest. Much classier this way.
RIP Sally Menke.
Time for the dead person popularity contest.
@daniAWESOME But you love Ladysmith Black Mambazo! #meangirls
An now, what @CassidyFletcher has been waiting all week for! Her bff Goop!
James Franco is so over it.
@CassidyFletcher Very happy. Making sense of two court cases plus multiple stories in flashback and never hitting a lull. Masterfully cut.
@HollyEgg I like your imagination, darling.
Was hoping for a lady editor to win two years in a row, but The Social Network was brilliantly cut.
ANd now for the award only @susanlu and I care about. #editgeeks
Whoever put Joseph Gordon Levitt in those brilliantly tailored suits in Inception deserves an Oscar.
Pretty sure I say this every time watch an awards show, but for reals. RDJ needs to call me.
You know what would keep this show from not going overtime? Not including all these unnecessary segments.
@daniAWESOME Seriously. His whole face has been sandblasted. He looks like a lady.
@midwestspitfire Don't make Sean Penn tell you what's what. #judelawisimportant
@CassidyFletcher That needed to happen. How did Banksy not win?
@CassidyFletcher @lennykoggins Who needs Franco when you have the enthusiastic fro-y short film dude!
You guys, his mom did craft services. ‚ô•
This guy is my favorite. #oscarfro
Aces, Charles! #stayinthecarchuck
Can I get a little more level on the mic? #whosincharge?
@JuddApatow Tell Bateman I said hi...and to call me.
e1 is thrilled that Rick Baker and his white ponytail just won an Oscar.
Seriously. I need to be Cate Blanchett.
Dear James Franco, a/v nerds can call each other nerds. You can't. You just sound like an asshole.
It's my people! Hi nerds!!
@lennykoggins True. That was awesome. I amend my statement. Cross dressing for comedic purposes only works at gas stations.
What the hell is up with Scar Jo and Wooderson. Do they understand that they're at a formal event?
Franco is still showing traces of lady makeup. Also, cross dressing is never funny.
I love that Trent Reznor is an Oscar winner.
I already took Film 101, thanks. #oscars
@CassidyFletcher Love him in that. And anyone who had anything to do with Deadwood is on my alltime faves list.
@CassidyFletcher Hawkes is my fave too. Though Bale was fantastic.
Sol Star! I like the idea of Trixie being at the Oscars. #deadwoodcrossover
Armie Hammer! His name must be shouted whenever he's in the shot. Because that is the best name ever. ARMIE HAMMER! #oscars
Helen Mirren is divine.
Oh god, now we're cross-dressing. No tell me high school kids are not in charge. #oscars
Why did that song happen?
@waitwait @wwoscars Are you drinking? That would help. Otherwise, no.
Is a high school production staff putting this show on? #amateurhour
@susanlu Was *just* getting ready to say the same. Very clever.
You guys, I am Sorkin's bitch. I know he kinda sucks at writing female characters, but I cannot resist the snappy dialog. #oscars
Why are they dressed like waiters? #oscars
@lennykoggins She is so pretty. I wish she woulda punched Timberlake in the neck though.
And to go back a couple awards, Roger Deakins was robbed, yo. #oscars
Dear Justin Timberlake, this is not about you.
@midwestspitfire She and Michelle Williams are bffs. Sitting up front, wearing black. She needs to throw something at Franco.
Kim Kelly is rocking the front row! I hope she rips Dan DeSaurio's head off and throws it over that fence. #freaks&geeksreunion
@lennykoggins You're here! Hello. And happy Oscar night.
@BeatriceMarie The network always hires someone who seems to have never been on the tv before. I would gladly accept the job!
@BeatriceMarie Why thank you. And I am enjoying your stellar avatar. And I think James Franco already forgot that interview happened.
Hugh Jackman is deeelightful.
Jlo is selling razors and drug store hair products. Is she poor?
Dear Christian Bale, this is the Oscars. Shave the weasel that's living on your face.
Nicole Kidman is wearing two different dresses. At least her hair is red again.
@HollyEgg Also the shade of blush.
The Bridges! Squee! I heart the Dude and his pretty lady.
Donald Trump. Why?
Is Gwyneth wearing a sexy space suit?
Halle's pretty, but the bottom of that dress looks like a craft project. #renegadegluegun
Colin Firth is wearing the hell outta that tux. #heneedstocallme
Helena Bonham Carter is batshit awesome.
@CassidyFletcher I adore her. And her hair. And not that dress. She's sexay and that neckline is...not. #oscars
@HollyEgg It's crazy and I kind of love it. And she can pull of anything.
I want to be Cate Blanchett when I grow up.
So glad they're not leting Guilana interview anyone. #oscars
Chuck on the Oscars! Aces! #oscars
Checking out Jackson Pollock's "Mural" at the Figge in Dport. Thank god the ridiculous idea to sell it was blocked.
@tvoti @midwestspitfire Excellent reason to by that album. Also, it's sublime. Do it!
@DM_in_the_PM At least it's not another Twilight cover. #brightside?
The one hour 'til the beer cart arrives countdown has begun.
Iron & Wine at Peoples? Squeeee! http://j.mp/hVg2t5
Fairly certain I have more Static Guard in my hair than actual hair product.
@tvoti If cost and space are no issue? Avid. Symphony or Media Composer. I use Symph and love it. Cheaper, more compact? Avid Xpress.
Black eyed peas *and* Usher? Why is hell being televised?
@susanlu @bknips  first 3 seasons are perfection. The kind of tv you want to experience again for the first time. Noel is my all-time fave
@bknips @susanlu Are you ladies talking West Wing? All time gave. My heart still belongs to Josh Lyman.
Alabama Whorley is my hero. It's been too long since I watched True Romance. My kinda love story.
Fifteen minutes 'til the beer cart rolls around! #finally
@GatewayMarket Does being a smart foodie get me a fried egg sandwich on the house? Because that would make my snow week. And my month.
@GatewayMarket Reduction?
@lrafdal Wow! What took you so long? @GatewayMarket 's fried egg sandwich is life changing.
@lrafdal Have you been down to Allspice in the East Village? Yummy stuff to be had. I picked up some French Walnut Oil. Tasty.
I scored 6571 points playing #QRANK. Can you beat that? http://bit.ly/b8lZZu
Ribeye with truffle butter. Truffle butter, you guys! I am in love.
@alexson Kitty hat! So cute. If only my cat would stop whining long enough to let me stocking cap her up!
This came in the mail from @sewzinki. Best dino eating cheese wallet evah. She's the bee's knees, yo. #TwitPict http://twitpic.com/3vtw9l
@allspiceguy Thanks for fun, tasty times Friday! CLUCK made us a delicious dinner last night. And I may just drink the walnut oil straight.
I pretty much have the worst p-p-p-p poker face. Ever.
I'm wearing a dress with birds on it. My hair looks like a nest. I wasn't planning on theme dressing today, but it may be working. Maybe.
My favorite rosemary asiago cheese is now available to buy online. So, the $8 wedge or the $79 five lb. quarter wheel? #cheesemonster
Just ate cheese soup. With beer in it. My day is better than yours. #cheesemonster
@DougBenson Don't tease abt doing a DesMoines show! If I offer to buy a round of bacon wrapped tator tots can we make this happen? Seriously
Golden Globes fashion and cheese.
Love the @nerdist podcast. Does it make editing a sports as a metaphor for corporate motivation video any better? No. But it's still rad.
Royal Mile fish and chips. Best way to fall off the new years eating healthy wagon.
I should be sentenced to a lifetime of a nonstop Fergie/BEP music for waiting so long to see Scott Pilgrim. Loved. Apologies @edgarwright
@BeatriceMarie Banjo concert...with appearances by autoharp? I must know more. Swoonworthy indeed.
At a bar playing Pass the Pigs. Only six other people in the world can say that. #peoplewhoareawesome
@mkeller10 I also love Arcade Fire like I love my cat. I suggest going back 2 albums to Funeral. Immerse yourself. It is perfection.
@mkeller10 How dare you question the awesomeness of Mumford & Sons? I've been obsessed since Feb. I like strummy & melancholy.
Completely obsessed with Cee-Lo's cover of "No One's Gonna Love You" by Band of Horses.
Though it technically doesn't start until Thurs after work, pretty sure holiday break started over lunch today w/ @hswell & @bornliar
Mi. Mexico. Late friends.
@stayingin Tres jealous! B&S needs to be put out of its misery, but I don't wanna live in a world where Matthew Rhys isn't on my tv weekly.
@stayingin Great underrated list! Esp Matthew Rhys. The show has gone downhill like whoa, but he still kills it. Totally my tv boyfriend.
Freidrich's Icicle latte is magical. Vanilla *and* amaretto.
"What am I going to drink next?" Musings by @hswell. THIS IS OUR JOB TODAY.
@Corycm My guess is that at least half of the booze in your twitter stream belongs to @hswell and I.
@hswell At the earliest.
@hswell For serious? You used the breathylizer already? I wanna try it!
@porkrind That would be the awesomest thing ever. Let's make this happen.
Coffee & Bailey's.
Christmas exchange complete. 75% of the gifts were booze. Also popular? The garden gnome and the shake weight.
@amyraelle Mimosas, bloody marys, a keg of home brew....
The company food and booze holiday brunch has begun. Yes. Booze. Yes it's 8:45.
Does the world really need another Fockers movie?
@Corycm Haha! (for sure) And truth be told, bad puppy chow is the worst. But when it's good, it's super tasty.
@amyraelle That lemonade *is* tasty. Especially when you have smart friends who pack flasks of vodka.
@Corycm @amyraelle DO YOU HATE EVERYTHING THAT IS FUN AND DELICIOUS?
@amyraelle Awesome. And seriously. It is the only think I will step inside the fair for. That and Kelly Clarkson.
@amyraelle Right? It's just as amazing as it sounds.
@amyraelle @corycm Also, you can buy full sized pickle wraps at the fair. Pickle Dogs! Only reason to ever venture into the state fair.
@amyraelle Yes! And they're such a treat this time of year since their presence usually dies off w/ tailgating season.
@Corycm In. Sanity. I should have known though, coming from a guy who hates wooly socks w/ adorable faces. But yeah, waterpacked meat is ew.
@amyraelle I'd go so far as to say pickle rolls are the perfect food. People who don't love them should be kicked in the shins.
Editing my third corporate comb-over already today.
James. Brown. Christmas.
Catching up on @nprfreshair podcasts...Terry Gross asking Jay-Z to define 'izzo' is kind of magical.
@shopdomestica Eeek! How crappy! Hope you find temp space soon!
@Corycm Flakey cream wafers. They're tasty sandwich cookies w/ frosting in the middle. Very tea for two. My faves.
When you bake at my house, sometimes you gotta use a shot glass for a cookie cutter.
Hit Girl was badass, but the rest of Kick Ass was meh. Though "Bad Reputation" hasn't been used so exquisitely since the Freaks & Geeks open
@amyraelle A truck stop perhaps? Pick up a unicorn tee while you're there.
@JoshMalina Three words: Bloody. Mary. Helmet. Six more: I need this in my life. #backwash
Just so you  know, the Red Baron v. Snoopy Christmas song by the Royal Guardsmen is the best Christmas song ever.
@petersagal Mumford and Sons is THE BUSINESS. So very much in love with them. It's been a year, thinking about going all the way.
@hswell That. Is. Awesome. I'm falling a sleep while logging video, but it doesn't seem to be affecting anyone.
Vampire Weekend and Iowa State Women's Basketball spot editing.
@hannahinman Love. Zots. So fizzy and delicious. I used to buy them at the shack. With a side of Fun Dip.
@YvonneBeasley If something is 'too Lebowski' you should probably do it.
@BrosAndSis_ABC Kevin Walker was already my gay tv boyfriend. Then he ate pot brownies & looked cute in a hoodie. #mightbetimetogoalltheway
Even though Sheriff Rick is dreamy, I'm not sure I woulda left the building. #walkingdead
If you haven't been to allspice in the East Village yet, go. Go now. Then thank me. 'Tis tres awesome.
@shopdomestica The shop looks cuter and cuter every time I stop in!
Imma come see you soon, @shopdomestica!
Gettin' ready to brave the wind & head down to the East Village for some holiday shopping w/ a couple of my best girls. Shop local, yo.
@phillipstribune In denial, I put off watching the last ATM. Finally watched. Please tell me you and AO will reappear on my tv soon.
Why hello, Freelance Whales. Thanks for making my Friday better. Giving in to the urge to drink a Coke was also a spectacular idea.
At Shorty's with four of my all time peeps.
Corner Deli in the Village of East Davenport is one of the best lunch places evah.
@bornliar what about nerd books. Who will buy the nerd books?
@susanlu Because you recently time traveled back to 2005 without even knowing it.
Dear people already waiting in line at Toys R us, why? What can possibly make it worth it? #blackfridaydm
@corycm Oh yeah. Because there's nothing better to do here. #welcometoboringtown
Also 75% of the people in this bar need to be cut off. #mangas #publicsinging
Other things Im thankful for: nerds, pinot, food w/ truffle oil in it, Arrested Development reruns, ewan mcgregor, cute winter coats, my cat
I'm so very thankful for TWO DOLLAR vodka drinks. Especially after a day spent with 32 people I'm sorta related to.
Cocktails in d-port are supa cheap, yo. This is my kinda xmas shopping.
@Kathy_L Thanks again for the tasty muffins! I totally had some, I mean, one for breakfast.
This weather you guys are all talking about doesn't seem to be happening where I am. Feeling left out.
Gloomy morning. Iron & Wine.
Dear Locust Street Tap, I heart you.
You guys, I'm kind of in love with the new Cee-lo Green album. It's all throwbacky and fun.
It's not even thanksgiving yet and Valley West is already at 65% insanity level.

@mkeller10 Did you go listen to the ghost hunters? I considered it.
I will buy the perfect fall shoe today over lunch. It will be suede and look like something my dad wore in the 70s only with a wedge.

Can today be over now? My Madison friends are on their way to visit me, and I have a feeling they've brought me cheese curds. WANT NOW!
@Corycm Season 1 or 2? Noel S2 is my all time fave. Closely followed S2 In Excelsis Deo. #isaidiwasobsessedright?

@Corycm Oh, Sports Night. Love. I still have a crush on Dan Rydell and use Sally Sasser as a fake name. Still hate the 'dating plan.'
@Corycm It's getting rave reviews so I figure it's worth a weekend matinee. Followed by DVD marathon of the West Wing Seasons 1-3 #sorkinite

@BornLiar I'm starting a new band called Plethora of Goats. You in? I'll be playing the autoharp.

The only thing missing from the Hurt Locker was break dancing. That has been remedied. hooray!

Happy birthday, @esahrmann! I got you this for your bday. http://tinyurl.com/bbfvwg
@Kathy_L Enjoy! One of my all time faves. You'll probably wanna get a Parisian Night Suit for the prom. Poor Sam Weir.
Just in case this scene of two dudes dancing isn't manly enough, Kevin Bacon's sitting on a tractor, CP's wearing work gloves. #manitup
Oooo, Kevin Bacon's teaching Chriss Penn how to dance! The picking the weeds move is my fave. It's @lennykoggin's too.
These kids are crossing state lines to dance? That's rebellion. #eveybodycutfootloose
@bornliar have i intro'd u to the gear daddies? Some Minnesota shit is goin' down.
I wanna drive a zamboni machine...
@bornliar @jerdoyle I'm the most popularist!! #firsttimeever
@jmvanderpol @bornliar Stay away from all onions or the anal toids will get u. Only an Tobias Funke, analrapist can fix it.
@bornliar Wow. I could not have made a worse word combination if I tried.
Headin' to @HighlifeLounge for fried pickles & grilled cheese. Then the Gear Daddies at Peoples! #dreamvacationinthedells
@thenadas See you there! #dreamvacationinthedells
@AdamCarroll Watch out for those front row kids. In my experience, they're always trouble. Especially if they're a/v nerds.
@jerdoyle You IMDB'd us? Super rad! And my profile is up 70% popularity...probably due to me just clicking on it. #coolkidsclub
@Kathy_L That's awesome! I can only assume your hair is full of sticks and leaves making you looking familiar.
No matter what I get from Jason's Deli, I end up with the most heinous onion breath ever. #gotanaltoid?
@Corycm I think you're hanging around with the wrong kind of sock monkeys.
@Corycm @sewzinski @susanlu If u were freaked out by scary stuff like wolves or velveeta it'd make sense. But sock monkeys just wanna love u
@sewzinski @corcym That is awesome sauce. Perhaps Cory and I should get a DM wine and lego-up in the works and make that bad boy.
Buy this now. U love Sedaris, u will love this.  http://tinyurl.com/y8j36lj Good airplane reading. Loud cackling makes people wonder.
It's Friday. Vampire Weekend is playing. The Gear Daddies is tonight. There's no way this day won't be awesome. Right? #pleasesayyes
@Corycm If it weren't for Sarah Vowell, I wouldn't have remembered it in the first place. Not as well versed in the GF as I should be.
@Corycm @sewzinski Dammit, Cory. You beat me to the 'take the cannoli' reference.
You know why you don't put perfume in your mouth? It tastes awful. That's why. #iamdoingitwrong

@daynegerous Arcade Fire at @8035 would blow my mind. I'd be dead, but it will have been worth it.
@lrafdal @corycm And I'm drinking the good coffee in the war b/t office coffee factions. Stronger /= better. Just better than the weak sauce

@susanlu And when I said bitchfest, I meant the media's representation. Pitting girl against girl. Woulda been different if it were guys
@KDCbuilt Impressive! So, were you a suspenders kid or a cheerleader in your day?
@susanlu Exactly. And if it were men, they'd be 'fierce competitors,' instead of this catty bitchfest. #whyIonlylasted2monthsatanewsstation

I hate nature shows w/ spazzy dudes in the swamp/jungle grabbing animals that want nothing to do w/ him. Ur gonna get bit. #dontactshocked
@mkeller10 Haha! @KDCbuilt and I started saying 'totes' to each other ironically. Now I find myself actually saying it. Ew. #lame&uncool
@bknips Also, not pesty. AT ALL. If you think of anything else, hit me up!
@bknips will probably be on my own during the day for the most part.
@bknips And regarding safety...am I'm good on my own during the day in the Quarter, etc? The hubs has a conference & I'm tagging along.
@bknips I will be super New Orleansy & have beingets & cafe au lait at Cafe du Monde every morning! This trip needs to be now instead of Apr
@bknips Eeee! Thanks, lady! Someone else recommended the muffaleta at City Grocery too, so that's a fo' sho. Cannot wait to explore!
Someone got to the blog today by searching: "poor man's family ties", "growing pains". I could not agree more. http://wp.me/pMeXu-10

@shanaraeray Love it! Lah-Keen-Tah Inn. Was it in Walla Walla Washngton?
@nprfreshair Two great things that go great together! Will not be able to listen to podcast in the car for fear of passing out from awesome.
@shanaraeray Haha! Best use of 'fergie' ever. Because, yeah, hell or heck or shit or whatever.
@sewzinski Oooo, lion mane. If anyone can pull it off, it's you. It'll go great with an animal print housecoat on the lanai! #yumcheesecake
@sewzinski Why thank you, darling. #1 reason I couldn't deal w/ your new climate, no cute winter coats. Plus humidity. And heat. Imma sissy.
Hatched a plan for world domination over lunch with @KDCbuilt. We are supreme rulers of noodles and garlic and cute winter coats.
Heading out to meet @KDCbuilt for lunch. She's one of my favorite girls.
@crazycrabb the King of Kong is one of my all time favorite movies, and Billy Mitchell is one of the worst movie villans ever. Team Wiebe!
@mkeller10 Aww, your life is hard. That being said, I like my microwave popcorn a little burny.

@lrafdal I saw an NKOTB license plate this morning. Which is the complete opposite of douchey. It's wicked awesome. @lennykoggins

Hot nerd action involving @bornliar going on over at Fifty2 Things! http://fifty2things.wordpress.com/
@chrissyjensen His grandfpa studied at DMU then did medical work on mission trips. Assuming his mom studied at christian college in Ankeny.
@chrissyjensen Sorry I missed your @ephemeradesign class! Totally slipped my mind. I'm there for sure if you do another one!!
@chrissyjensen Oh, I know. I felt soooo bad for that guy. And then "Only someone on meth would do this." Made me laugh.
@justcourtney @chrissyjensen It totally cracked me up when he said his mom studied in Iowa. "In a place called Ankeny."
@justcourtney Please work on getting his family back for some kind of alumni event. I promise not to stalk him. #noidon't
Catching up on @nprfreshair. Things I've learned: Colin Firth's mom lived in Ankeny for a bit & @azizansari is a great way to start the day.
Earthquake in Illinois? What the what? Didja feel anything @lennykoggins?
RT @Fifty2Res: Crushes of...a different sort.: http://wp.me/pMeXu-3u
@DSMJSM Watching last weeks episode and laughing out loud at the neighborhood watch award. It's a plaque! And Sam nominated me!
@DSMJSM Love him. Sharon Gless totally makes the show for me too. Love when they have scenes together. Sad he's moving out of her pad.
@Corycm Are you kidding? That was the best of all of the Superbowl commercials!! Your fear of sock monkeys perplexes and amuses me.
I like Burn Notice despite the main actor's questionable acting & sketchy accents. And you can't go wrong with Machete as a guest #badassery
@erinriker K. I. D. S. Yeah! I have no idea what that kid's name was. Never realized the cast rotated so often. Hit 14 & ur out. #likemenudo
I crushed on The Artful Dodger, Hoops McCann, Joey Joe, Orry Main, Mullet Weave & someone named Trey Ames. You? http://wp.me/pMeXu-3h
Just read a Facebook status featuring no less than five grammatical errors. Resisting the urge to make corrections.
@DSMJSM Just started listening to the new Vampire Weekend last week. I loves it!
@bornliar Afraid my single-standard time step is no match for your pop & lock. I may have to upgrade to the triple. #ohsnap
@BornLiar I seem to recall you saying you would do a breakdance show in my front yard some time. As soon as the snow melts.... #july
Kitty half time show is killing me with cute. And now I need a kitten.
Just saw An Education. @nathantwright disguised as his alter ego SAARSGAARD was brilliant as usual. The talking ladies behind me weren't.
@lennykoggins An Education. And it turned out, the two old ladies behind me who gave color commentary were far more annoying.
Overheard lady in movie theatre say she'd leave her phone on. Now she's sitting in front of me. #bitch
One bloody mary. two beers. one jimmy john's Italian night club. three computer crashes. 1 minute of video.
@susanlu Stay warm, dear!!
In the edit suite. Gettin' ready to make music videoz with @hswell and @BlutigerFluss
@iowaradioguy Yay! Was it Foolish Beat? That's my fave.
Checkout girl talking about her depressed ferret. What does that have to do with snow again? #shecrazy
One day I will learn to not wear Chucks when it snows. Today is not that day. #canvasisnotwaterproof
Come on caffeine. Let's do this! Now would be good.
@sewzinski Thanks for the #FF, lady. Check back later to see @hswell's collage of cute boys.
Drinking the red wine with @hswell. Yay for Thursday night. Boo for Friday morning.
Crushes are being revealed.From Kirk Cameron to Sage Stallone(WTF?), who made the list of hunks so far? http://fifty2things.wordpress.com
Hooray! One hour 'til fried pickles and winez with @hswell and The 20th Anniversary "Rachel" Advertising Lady.
@iowaradioguy Iowans clearly have good taste!
@Sculfy At Hugh's no less. Well played, lady!
Is it the end of the day yet? I'm ready for lady drinks with @hswell and The 20th Anniversary "Rachel" Advertising Lady.
@AdamCarroll Mostly I just really wanna wear a cape.
@Corycm I'm drinking Marley coffee right now and it's tasty. I do not, however, care for reggae.
@mkeller10 Also, for some reason, I love instruments that sound kind of ugly. Now, where to buy an accordian...
@mkeller10 My list is is very mockable. Except for the bagpipes. They're melancholy. Total opposite of acapella. And that's good.
My favorite instruments, in no particular order are: mandolin, banjo, bagpipes, accordian and autoharp. I want to learn to play one of them.
@bknips Blue sweet tarts? They're the best! If you dog doesn't want them, you can save 'em for me. #desperateforcandy
@hswell Um, but for reals?
@hswell I hate you.
So, Mary Hart is satan, yes? They've never been seen at the same place at the same time. #whyisthishitonmytv #lazychannelchanger
@hswell @sewzinski Oooohhhh 2: And then you can eat cheesecake on said Lanai! Wearing a house dress!
We know you made a collage of all the boys & girls you crushed on in 7th grade. We wanna see it! http://fifty2things.wordpress.com/
r/t @lennykoggins Groundhog day was really invented by a drunk guy named Merle. Who knew? http://fifty2things.wordpress.com
@HollyEgg Thanks for your super sweet blog comments, lady! Comments like that are really helping right now as we get this all figured out!
Super rad Q&A w/ Darlton for all you Losties: http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/02/02/lost-premiere-damon-carlton/
@hswell How much do I love that we tweeted our now playing at the same time. Me: Kermit the Frog. You: Buddy Holly. You: much cooler
How great is it when you leave Itunes on shuffle, leave the room for 10 min & come back to Rainbow Connection? Answer: Really great.
Pasta with peas, mushrooms and La Quercia Prosciutto. And cream sauce...lots and lots of cream sauce.

Valentine's Day is already kind of a dumb holiday. Now it's also the worst looking movie ever. Don't they know Love Actually already exists?
@BlueCompass I hope the 60 foot tower of flames version of Jacob is on. And that Locke has his bucket! #notgonnahappen #lost
@schippers On my couch. I know there's stuff going on, but I require complete silence and absolute concentration when I watch Lost. #nerd.
Oscar nominations and Lost premiere in the same day? It's like my Superbowl. I should probably have beer and nachos for lunch.
Almost time for Oscar nominations! #oscargeek
We're having a few Growing Pains. We want to be Mike Seaver, but we might be Carol. Or worse, Chrissy. http://fifty2things.wordpress.com/
@amywright I know that spokesperson guy! He live here in Des Moines. Super nice guy. Super crappy, and rather retarded statement though.
@lennykoggins Yes, a cat named Cheeseburger. He had a brother named Milo & they were a huge pile of cuddling cat & I wanted them.
Ham & bean soup and massive kitchen reorganization. Love sundays.
@lennykoggins Dammit! And now I want pork belly and sweet breads. And champagne and gimlets and sambuca. Let's go there for my bday again.
@lennykoggins We mos def share a brain. I fell in love with a shelter cat called Cheeseburger last weekend & wanted to bring him home.
This Buble character should seriously consider standing still when he sings. Can Sergio play sax on this tune please?
Working my way through a wedge of Maytag Blue Cheese. We're in love. And it's serious.
@Corycm You had me at wasabi mayo. I'll be back there in about a month and eating that burger is officially on my 'to do' list.
This girl on What Not To Wear is *rough*. Stacey & Clinton are appalled. It's hilarious.
@nathantwright Are you kidding? Sparky got that fortune once at Taste of Thailand in Urbandale. It may still be taped to his monitor at work
Catching up on Burn Notice. Cagney & Lacey 4eva!!
@amywright And I apologize for the various forms of 'bitch' I tossed around. It was meant with love. Tot love!
@bornliar needs to write something funny for me to respond to. I might need a laugh six months from now. Teamwork! #nofive
Engaged @amywright in a text battle last night. Assuming the east coast/westcoast rap battles were similar. I lost. Does that make me Tupac?
And Poisoned Boy has made the first liver reference of the day. Too early for that. #youdon'twannnaknow
@jerdoyle we drink tangermeisters & eat sit down dinners in your honor
@Kathy_L You'll put in hard work stuffing tots in  your mouf.
@Corycm Another thing @lennykoggins and I always do? Drink bloody marys on the Front Street patio after the Preeclampsia Walk. We heart pubs
@Corycm Love Front Street too! Those 2 pubs + rudy's are the only places I eat in the QC anymore. Only been to the deli once, but loved.
@Corycm Have you been to the new and 'improved' 11th St? HATE. So bad I opened a Yelp account to bitch about it. Tenderloins er still tasty.
@Corycm @sewzinski @lennykoggins and I hit up Blue Cat every time we're in town. Tasty. But the service is a disaster.
@Corycm There's a new-ish deli on the corner in the East Village that is amazing for lunch. Corner of 11th and Mound. #fattymeatsandcheeses
Ready for beers & tots w/ my film making pals @hswell @bornliar @kathy_l @frojive @amywright & PoisonedBoy. Maybe drunk tweets for @jerdoyle
@HollyEgg Ames Antiques on Main can be cool. Also a place S side of town on Duff/Hwy69. Looks like it's from a horror movie, but good finds.
@SmartyPig Al roker
r/t @hswell Tonight we drink to our 2nd place finish in the DM 48Hr Film Project! Time to revisit this little gem: http://bit.ly/LVnmg
@hswell A little gem written by Des Moines' little gem! @bornliar dies inside every time we call him that. #hesecretlylovesit
@TVGuide Live streaming something that happened two weeks ago? Fancy.
I have come out from behind the Segway riding banana. But now I don't recognize my own icon in my twitter stream.
I loathe their baby-making circus but hopefully the Duggars talking about the new spawn, will spread Preeclampsia awareness & make them stop
@HollyEgg Ha! I forgot about that one. "What did women do before Russel Crowe?" Clooney. Like Chanel, he never goes out of style. I agree.
@HollyEgg I always thought it was the one about George Clooney bing like Chanel.

I have special affection for green eye shadow.
RT @Fifty2Res: "That's a cool ass dickey," says you. http://wp.me/pMeXu-A
@iowaradioguy More appalling than someone calling Des Moines a crappy town, is that someone would call the Black Eyed Peas a cool band.
@BornLiar Is this the part where I make fun of you and shout GO-BOTS!! (??)
@mkeller10 You're aware that 'wine' shouldn't be poured from cardboard, yes?
@metromixdm Wow. That list seems rather uninspired. Those restaurants serve delicious food. And have been doing so for a while now.
Heather and Mi Mexico and I are three peas in a pod.
@mkeller10 A big ol' box o' wine in your fridge, eh? Um...why?
Dear Mother Nature, thanks for NOT blowing all the neighborhood snow to driveway for the first time. Still not sure if we're back together.
About 1.5 hours into the 5-6 hour process that is Julia Child's Boef Bourginon. Smells like wine and beef in the house.

@susanlu Eeee! e1 hates commercials so I'm tivo-ing it right now. Sharon Gless totally makes that show for me. Bruce Campbell doesn't hurt.
I just can't bring myself to read any blog that has emoticons in the text. Seriously, people. You're not 12. And it's not 1997.
@garlicgirl I want to go to there!
@garlicgirl You & me both, sister. But the wind we're supposed to get tonight scares me.
@garlicgirl Just talked to the mister, and his office is out of power, city building near Ank. Blvd & 1st, but our home is fine. NW Ankeny.
Table in our lunch area has become a drop-off spot for "shit I don't want, take it if you do." Um, nobody wants your crappy old vhs movies.
Happy birthday, @HollyEgg!!
Roads aren't terrible. Just wet. If you don't drive like an asshole, that is.
Wish the news would just say "If you drive like an asshole, stay home. If you're not a psycho, be careful and you should be fine."
@chrissyjensen Thanks for the update, lady! Think I'm gonna test the neighborhood streets and go from there.
Anybody have a road report for I-80?
I'm so tired of Christmas commercials...and have an insane backlog of Tivo to catch up on. #betterofftedmarathon

Seriously, RDJ. CALL ME!
Robert Downey Jr., call me!
@susanlu Fox. Currently on hiatus for that karoke show. It's pure cheesy goodness. The pilot is amazing. #justasmalltowngirl
@chrissyjensen 30 Rock's definitely a better show, but it's won every award ever. Glee is fresh and new and so much fun!! #musicalnerd
Um, something's wrong here. On my tv, James Cameron just beat out Bigelow and Tarantino. That makes no sense.
Scorsese is my personal savior.
@susanlu All of their foreheads are so shiny. And immobile! Why do they not know it looks crazy?
Kinda wanna make out with Halle Berry. Way foxier when she does edgy rather than pretty.
Sue Sylvester will not be pleased. Wack.

@Corycm I *do* look a lot like Billy Ocean. And I *do* want you to get outta my dreams & into my car. But all similarities end there.
@Corycm Haha! I'm thinking less Celine Dion, more Buddy Holly.
@sewzinksiThough jazz hands kind of negate the whole rock star thing. #nerdyrockstar
@sewzinski Rock star! **jazz handz**
"Stay in the car, Chuck!" And Sam Beckett. And "aces, Charles." And @adamsbaldwin! Thanks SyFy! #chuckmarathonftw
@KDCbuilt OF COURSE! And it will say, "do you know how awesome i am??" Also, a refrigerated cheese pocket.
@KDCbuilt All 3 of those things sounds awesome. I will make fancy mayor jackets for us with secret flask pockets.
I don't understand foursquare and I refuse to care about it. Also, booze goes bad if you don't drink it once it's open. #Iwanttobelucille1

@mkeller10 When splattered artfully, blood can be pretty in snow too!

@susanlu @hollyegg It's a dvd. It's awesome because it's only 25 minutes. 25 MINUTES OF HELL!! @hswell & @sewzinski will concur.

Buffy marathon on Logo! An excellent justification for not leaving the couch today. Weee!
@sculfy @ericspencer1 It wasn't the main song. The one where Steve Zahn sings. The band loved me for knowing the tune.
Oh em gee! The band at the party i'm at just played a sonv from 'That Thing You Do!' A Oneders original!
I think it's gonna be a liquid eyeline kinda night. Which for me means fancy. And a little complicated.

@HollyEgg I refuse to believe there is ever a situation in which Ewan McGregor is not dead sexy. #totallymyfreebie

@chrissyjensen @sewzinski Tis true. She will kick your ass & mock you. Which means I should start spending mornings w/ her again.
@Corycm Just noticed your cheese tweet. Ha! Oslauf and cheese got together like peas and carrots.
Watched Sound of Music constantly as a kid. Why did I never notice how hot Captain Von Trapp is? Or catch on to the whole Nazi subplot.
Coffee, Deadliest Catch marathon, Sunday laziness.
Home! Love the family, but always happy get back & relax. Now tea and checking for Broke-ass Roadtrip updates from @hswell.
Bailey's on the rocks and cards with the family.

@porkrind No. No it is not. That place is called heaven. And it is made of delicious, stinky cheese. Served in an attractive manner.

The resolution I've been dreading is almost here. Come watch at Hughs Jungle Room 12.23.09 There's a 100% chance I'll look like a fool.
Onto the dark homebrew. And cheese. So much fancy cheese! Today will not end well.
@TobyFunke I do believe it's a blend. But I know nothing about scotch. Except for that it seems to feel more than taste. My chest is burny.
Drinking scotch, following coffee & baileys and mimosas. Oh, and I'm working.
Time for lady drinks!
@Corycm Word.
@Corycm My Christmas rap of choice is Christmas in Hollis, though they are both ____(insert rap slang that means good here.)

@Corycm Took a break for client talk. Tuned back in to the Ramones, Merry Christmas (Don't wanna fight.) You're back in the nice list!!

@Sculfy @bknips Yet I'm nostalgic for the old version. Shitty coffee for a guy visiting from college? Ok. S. Africa? He deserves better.
If I traveled from South Africa to be with my family for the holidays and they  had Folgers crystals waiting for me, I'd be pissed.
Started and completed all Christmas shopping in about an hour and a half. So, I guess there's something not bad about being home sick.
@TobyFunke Haha! MurderCats: For that special kid in your life. Who deserves to be mauled this holiday season. Get 'em while supplies last!

@sewzinski @lennykoggins and I were kickin' it in the QC. And by kickin' it I mean drinking ourselves silly.
@porkrind It wants to be a blog entry, but the extent to which 2 drunken sisters convinced their mom it wasn't that bad remains an obstacle.
Dinner theatre is effing stupid. thank god for vodka. And the raddest family ever.
Vodka and the best sister ever make bad dinner theatre kinda fun.
Dinner theatre: So cheesy it's circled around and become kind of awesome.
Dinner theatre. Hmmm. At least they have a martini list.

@timothyadam Hey, thanks for featuring my meaty vintage cookbook!
Posting stuff to etsy while e1 watches Heroes. It looks really, really dumb. Poor HRG. He deserves better. #nobodyeverdies
@sewzinski I know! I was shouting at the tv, "stop screwing around penguin, run! Get out of there," while e1 laughed at me. #toosissy4nature
@sewzinski I'm going to embroider this on my tea towel. http://tinyurl.com/yccner3 #someaty
The Planet Earth shows are amazing. But I am way too sissy for the circle of life. Run, penguin, run! Don't let the seal eat you!
@sewzinski A lesson plan? Fancy. Will I have to run to Kinkos to pick up a syllabus?
@angatdorotheas Dead from cute. I want!!
@sewzinski Might? Being crafty intimidates the hell outta me. I may require a tranquilizer.
@sewzinski I think meeting a creatively-challenged and craft anxiety suffering @CourtneeCee could be a big attraction.
@DSMJSM It was awesome! All the sudden I was singing, "Many thanks, sincerely. Jane & Michael Banks," in my head. And out loud a little.
Piano player at Von Maur playing selections from Mary Poppins!!
@nathantwright Oh, it's easy to get me out of Skankeny. I'm pretty much never there. But being kidnapped does sound like a great adventure!
@johnpemble Carl Kassell cannot leave @WaitWait. I won't allow it. And I don't have his voice on my home answering machine yet!!
@sewzinski Happy birthday, pretty lady!
@sewzinski @nathantwright Rest assured, I would never choose Skankeny over either one of you.
@sewzinski Thanks for the r/t darling. Speaking of pretties, you and @hswell looked super fab at your party! Happy almost birthday!
Just finished my usual Sunday night update to So Fetch Vintage, my etsy store. http://www.etsy.com/shop/SoFetchVintage
I have a lady date tonight. A little nervous. She's way cooler than me.
If I make it through today, I deserve a prize. A good one. Possibly made out of alcohol. Or cheese.
Finally leaving work. That's 24 hours in two days. Sleepy.
@Corycm I like soup. And talking and not talking. #bestinshow
@sewzinski Well, darling, there may be one with Jack, Chrissy and Janet with your name on it. It is your bday month after all.
Amazing shipment from ebay has arrived. 47 vintage trading cards. Three's Company, Dallas, BSG, A-Team, the Hulk! $.99 bitches!
@lrafdal Stop posting pictures of your bedroom on twitter. It's creepy.
All components of my computer are finally working. Nobody sneeze. Or breathe hard. And for god's sake definitely don't look at it funny.
Workin' on the night cheese...
Help me @hswell - wan - kenobi. You're my only hope.
@sewzinski Ah, yes. I was confused. And there's a good to excellent chance I had some high waisted sailor pants as a kid. I was theme-y.
@sewzinski High waisted jeans scare me. Even if they are cute and sailor-y. #shortgirl
RT @lennykoggins May not remember the boy, but I remember the dance. Share your school dance memories http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com
@sewzinski Be careful. Mr. Tripper is sitting next to Chachi. Don't pass out from 80's awesome overload.
@sewzinski You know I have an autographed picture of John Ritter in my office, yes? He's thoughtfully staring at me right now.
@sewzinski Perhaps Jack will stop over and fall down hysterically behind a couch.
@DSMJSM Love it! Would look amazing with a plaid lunchbox and monocle. Tho it's so lovely, it'd look good with just about anything.
@stevenpage And yet the craziest thing about that dream is that someone would actually watch the Jay Leno show.
Checked Skankeny Hy-vee for @TempletonRye. Didn't have any, but noticed a new price tag. $50! Is this the case everywhere? Too spendy for me
@DSMJSM That sounds amazing! Now I dying to see the cape and lunchbox together. If this happens, take a picture! Old stuff is the best.
@DSMJSM Haha! A cape would be fab. Maybe a monocle too?
@HollyEgg I do not get the Twighlight thing. What is that? Grown women should not be that into pasty emo teenage vampires. I refuse.
Hey, where did all my coffee go? Oh, I see. It's on my shirt. Travel mug seal FAIL! Luckily the shirt I packed for the gym is somewhat cute.
@susanlu Aw, that's awesome. I adore him in everything. Don't remember him in Wonder Boys, but haven't seen that since in the theatre.
It is a rule that the character played by Alan Tudyk in any tv/movie will always be my favorite. It is also a rule that he will always die.
@susanlu Yay! Congrats! Also, you crazy. That piece is the opposite of crappy. I heart vintage christmas stuff.
Filling my etsy store up with new old vintage finds! Love the Mad Men-esque champagne glasses http://www.etsy.com/shop/SoFetchVintage
Dear ISU band, for that dance i will put a ring on it.
Apache! Jump on it.
@sewzinski How did I not know that Jim was such an experienced impressionist. And between Burt and Karl, I am his target market.
There was no actual bird woman. FALSE ADVERTISING! We moved on to singing Jolly Holiday. While drinking all afternoon at a pub on fleet st.
@susanlu So true. Poor bird woman. Last year when my sis & I were in London we sangs we walked by St. paul's cathedral.
@susanlu @chrissyjensen  I will be Burt to your Mary. Chim-chimeny....
@BornLiar Well, you are Des Moines' little gem, afterall. Maybe WWRD should become WWDMGD?
@BornLiar What's your biggest strength when it comes to your craft?
@liabolicious That mascot is terrifying. Yet so hott. Excellent choice.
Worst hold music ever! And it keeps repeating. Serenity now!
@tvoti Finally, Community has become the show I've wanted it to be. Debate 109 is it's first truly great episode.
@frojive Aw, sorry. Gimme some sweet tarts and I can take of that for ya.
@porkrind If the van has wood paneling and laffy taffy on the inside, I'm there.
I want candy.
Removing the fancy.
@frojive Please provide the top ten reasons Rob should be pleased. Echo and the Bunnymen should be referenced.
@Corycm Yikes. That place was trouble. Friends of mine were jumped in there once. Can't a guy just get a delicious yellow cheesed burrito?
Apparently @hswell's song did give my computer an STD. 2:30 and it's just now working. DO NOT make symphony play Kid Rock. You will suffer!
@Corycm For some reason I'm thinking the Brady one closed. Yes, EV is the way to go. Not only is the food better, they have a homies machine
http://twitpic.com/p97qg - @Corycm The day after my sister's lovely wedding, we brunched at Rudy's. This happened:
@Corycm I have the creepy guitar toting cowboy hat wearing homie. I 'spose the creepy goes without saying.
Unecessary things in my purse making it heavy: 7 lipglosses. 1 homie.
@sewzinski YES! Someone needs to put Gretchen Weiners back in her place. I heard she was wearing silver hoops today. THAT'S MY THING!
@sewzinski Sadly, I'm afraid I fall short on both accounts.
I'm @hswell-less today. I don't like it.
@Corycm I don't know who that is, but it sounds fancy. Maybe I'll pop in then!
@Corycm I want to #whineupwineup. I also just need to stop in the shop sometime when you're there. Next week, maybe?
I am being mocked by a bowl of candy. Stop staring at me Nerds! http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
@clairecelsi That girl needs to go away like, yesterday. If I have to hear her talk one more time about people discriminating against HER...
@susanlu So cute!
@hswell WTF? Were you martinized or did you get the weather report? And who else would be in your cell if not you?
@daytrotter I adore him! If only I could make it to the QC tonight.
@Suzika Congratulations! Iowa is lucky to have you. We're are far more fashionable place with you in it!
Just made my 3rd etsy sale at So Fetch Vintage! I knew starting the day with a pumpkin spice latte would bring great things!
Hooray! I'm all signed up for @sewzinski's embroidery class at @ephemeradesign next week! The @fifty2res girls'll be out learnin' stuff.
I kinda hate the 'new tweets' number on my firefox tab. It makes me all anxious, like I'm missing something super important. #twitteranxiety
@BornLiar Unless you're not eating junk food for a week. In which case you concoct an evil plan to eliminate shake enjoying friends.
Due to crappy songs @hswell made me edit, there's a pretty good chance my Avid has an STD. #needatopicallotion.
@sewzinski @corycm How much to I love that Jim has a Karl Casell impression. Anyone who takes the time to develop that is made of awesome.
@Corycm I want Karl Cassel doing that Dylan impression on my home answering machine. A lot.
@Corycm Fresh Air reviewed it last week. Not good. Not good at all. They charity getting proceeds will likely lose money.
Apparently, if you flip the switch just right, by turning one room's lights on, you can turn everyone elses off. Handy.
@Corycm Do you read Movieline's Mad Man Power Rankings? Includes a particular rating I won't repeat out loud. http://tinyurl.com/yk5ufdx
@Corycm @porkrind Oh, coffee is mos def my drug of choice. But I like tea too. Up until the teabags and balls talk. #warmcaffieneonly
@Corycm @porkrind I'm a tea drinker, but now that I've read your dirty, dirty conversation, I'm having second thoughts.
@DSMJSM For sure. I will happily deliver it to you!
@susanlu Thanks for the r/t. I'm super excited...even though both of my sales so far have been to friends. Oh wells.
@amywright I am definitely intrigued and think I might check it out. The likelihood of my attendance goes way up if you will be going too.
I've made my second etsy sale! Hooray!  http://www.etsy.com/shop/SoFetchVintage
@justcourtney That's what I do with my extended family. I use donorschoose.com & support a school in their area.
@amywright Thanks, lady. I'll look into it. I've never heard of Nia. Do you do it regularly?
Looking to take some sort of class or attend a seminar. Gotta do some learnin' this week. Any suggestions?
@Corycm That being said, I hated season 1 Pete. And nanny nailing Pete.
@Corycm I've always had a soft spot for Pete Campbell despite his douchiness. His pathetic desperation for Draper's approval gets me.
I kinda want to be Peggy Olson when I grow up. But can I have Joan's wardobe? #madmen
@Corycm Love. Will work for SCDP.
@susanlu I taught back in the day. It was pretty fun. Mostly kids tap and ballet. Didn't get paid much considering how much studio charge!
@sewzinski @chrissyjensen @susanlu I will single standard time step my face off. As long as I don't have to wear a leotard.
@sewzinski Yes I still want a cheese wallet. Though I totally understand if you thought I was kidding. #cheeseporn
@sewzinski I haz jazz hands. My wallet says so.
@amywright I heart vintage stuff. And screw Regina George, fetch will happen.
@sewzinski @chrissyjensen I could be tempted to dust off my old tap shoes. #puttinontheritz
@sewzinski I'm sure if we put our heads together, @chrissyjensen & I can find a new venue. I think this performance deserves a new audience.
I'm not the only one who's incredibly happy whenever tunes from the Muppets Take Manhattan soundtrack shuffle up, am I? #notafraidtoadmitit
@susanlu Ooo, what kind of marker? I love the smell of dry-erase marker.
Working on my Etsy Vintage Store, So Fetch. Gretchen Weiners would approve. http://www.etsy.com/shop/SoFetchVintage
Watching Paula Deen. Would be trashed if her show were a drinking game. Drink whenever she says y'all or butter. #foodboozecoma
@hswell Just saw an American Airlines spot that reminded me of you. A producer dealing w/ "artists." But she was in Paris. That's cooler.
The OK State kicker is wearing jazz shoes.
Glad I'm sitting on the shady side not the melty side of the stadium. #whatwouldracheldo

Best weather for a football game all season. In November. I usually skip Nov. games.
@iowaradioguy Bad music near my tailgate too. Apparently we didn't get the bring your douche music to ames memo.
@johnpemble Plus nobody ate a guinea pig. Disappointing.
Just made a grown up dinner. Yum. Parsnips...who knew?
@alexson Are you serious? Because that sounds like the most amazing thing ever.
@iowaradioguy Modern Family is fantastic. I absolutely adore Manny.
@porkrind Have some good asiago, but a mishmash of other ingredients. Combining lots of recipes. Luckily you really can't go wrong w/ cheese
V! Most of the thinky stuff went over my head in the original. The eating of mice and birds, & the skin peels where enough for me. #alienspa
Making some experimental mac and cheese.
Don't chew gum on the phone. It's the most disgusting sound ever.
@Brianne_Sanchez The Preeclampsia Foundation. A common but not well known disease affecting pregnant women. Lost a healthy 25 yr old friend.
@Corycm I love unnecessary string arrangements. See also: Sondre Lerche.
@PatServo @porkrind Recently, the A/V club did in depth recap/reviews of each Deadwood ep. Very insightful. http://tinyurl.com/yz9ova7
@PatServo The midair fight falling off the Gem's balcony? Pretty gory fight for breakfast!  The show's even better on 2nd viewing, no?
@todayshow The Gosselins are not news. Stop it! Stop it now! #ithasbeen15mintues
@porkrind The little fake whore = Veronica Mars! And yes, that whole thing was horrifyingly brutal.
@PatServo You actually are watching Deadwood over breakfast! Well done. That's a lot of murder and swearing this early in the morning.
@PatServo Al's a better bad guy, because he's awesome & Ian McShane's a far better actor.but Cy is scarier because he has no rules.
@PatServo Also, my porch gnome is named after Al. My favorite tv character ever.
@PatServo Gotta be careful of what ep you watch over food. Probably not one where someone gets thrown to Wu's pigs. #differentkindofbacon
@porkrind It's re-running Sun. nights on DirectTv ch101. Each time it ends, a single tear rolls down my face. Then I swear at my cat.
Shitheel is a word that needs to come back into fashion. God bless you, Al Swearengin.
Thanks @IowaPublicTV for airing the Monarchy series today. I heart all things British, and it helped nurse me through my halloween hangover.
@hswell u dressed up?
I guess if someone's gonna end up with a headwound, it might as well be the shamwow guy. #madeingermany
@sewzinski Pics now please!
Time to start getting all Daphne'd up!
@amywright I will just be at a party in Skankeny. Though I'd love to see slutty nun and whorey SAARS!
Only a few jokes so far and I'm completely ok with that. A simple trick or treat is fine by me. #badfakelaugh
@garlicgirl Definitely retro cool. I live life according Amy Sedaris and she's pro-cheeseball.
@hswell I'm not, but I can/should be.
@BornLiar And that's the 17th time you've experience true awesomeness.
@amywright Slutty alter boy = hot pants with a short gowny top. DO IT!
@sewzinski @amywright Is @nathantwright gonna be slutty saars? I've found a purple dress, but still kinda looking for a perfect purple dress
@Pleepleus coumarin
@nathantwright How much do I love that you have a patio and beer list. And that I'm on it. Saars!
@nathantwright Walking was a bitch & required a crayon box traffic controller. It was just 4costume judging. Took it off for trick r treat
@Corycm Hey, you #FF'd me! Wait, that sounds dirty.
My all-time favorite costume. http://twitpic.com/njyid Read about it and submit your own! http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
I heart my halloween-vatar. Anything can happen on halloween... http://tinyurl.com/23bpvr
Got a flu shot and a Bugs Bunny band-aid. Nice.
Flip flops are not appropriate footwear right now. That may have something to do with why ur at the doctr today.
Have Black Eyed Peas in my head due to @Pegasus515 's client's dumb music choice. Desperate for palate cleanser. It's Blitz will do nicely.
Woke up dreaming I was yelling at @Pegasus515 to Shut. That. Effing. Song. Off. I have no doubt I will actually say that sometime today.
@chrissyjensen Kevin and Jen are my faves. My sister @LennyKoggins had a spontaneous dinner w/ Stephanie from Chicago last week!
@sewzinski I gots to get me a purple dress. You, lady, are already badass enough in real-life. People will be dropping like flies on Sat.
I heart Kevin from Top Chef. Mike. V's a whiny bitch.
So, apparently I'm gonna be Daphne from Scooby Doo for halloween. Boys and their Wednesday night scheming.
@Corycm How did I miss that? I listen to both Ira and Peter every week. #drat!
@BornLiar @sewzinski Brilliant! A Cheese Island guy and scalloped potatoes wallet. With a fat man. And a spatula. And hooters. And marge.
@Corycm That is the most obscure piece of trivia ever. Now I kinda want to see that movie. Is Carl Kassel featured?
@sewzinski Well, when you add a spatula, that changes things.
@johnpemble Just another reason I adore @petersagal. And "Wait, Wait" in general.
@Corycm @sewzinski In my quest to find that clip on Youtube, I came across a bunch of videos of the place that inspired it. Very funny.
@sewzinski Cool. So you know I don't really want a fat dude on a wallet, right?
@sewzinski @corycm WHAT? Go here now. http://tinyurl.com/2llvc8
@Corycm @sewzinski Hahaha! Perhaps I need a fat man on my wallet too.
@susanlu What do you sell on etsy? I'm gearing up to open a vintage shop. Gotta clear some stuff out. #packrat
@sewzinski Also, I need a cheese wallet. Not kidding. Only one specification. NO VELVEETA. It's the devil's cheese.
@hswell Has @Corycm invaded our office? That suggestion is strangely and frightningly on the mark.
@sewzinski I vote you. You're much cuter and can pull off pretty much anything. #fancyhobo.
I'm wearing a cute shirt today, but it gets super wrinkly. #looklikeahobo
@iowaradioguy Not a huge fan of the joke telling. My fake laugh isn't very good. Now at least I know who to blame. Damn you Kathryn Krieg!
@jen0423 I heart Glee to death. But let's pretend the thong song never happened. It made me uncomfortable. Like most thongs do.
@porkrind @susanlu Ha! Sadly, I'm dealing with gelcaps. But I think a spoon could still come in handy. Maybe some foil? #canIborrowalighter?
Ugh, headache. And I've taken far more the recommended number of advil for one day.
@Brianne_Sanchez Thanks for the r/t. And tres jealous you are seeing Monsters of Folk!
Looking to do some volunteer work this week for the blog. Looking for suggestions!
@scHarvey Space cowboy! Oh, Captain Mal.
@TobyFunke Sadly, I've heard two 'moneys' in the last two days. Unironically. Turns out I'm the moniest.
I'm looking to do some volunteering this week. Suggestions? http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
@Corycm Agreed. It's been a slow burn, but it's totally paying off. And a kid dressed as a hobo never hurts.
Mad Men is so effing good.
r/t @Fifty2Res Help us celebrate the Warner's and all they're doing to support the Preeclampsia Foundation! http://tinyurl.com/npwssz

@KevinMcCarthy I visited Wollersheim over the summer. The sangiovese is tasty. It's a cool place.
@KevinMcCarthey I visited Wollersheim over the summer. The Sangiovese is tasty. Cool place.
Thanks for not breaking my heart today, cyclones.
Gorgeous day to be out and about. Got some stellar thrifting going on.
@porkrind But it's an honor! Fresh slimy balls, especially for you! #iamnotthatimportant
@porkrind A Russian waitress at an Indian restaurant? I love that! Also love a good service person who will tell you what's what and/or no.
Lambs are cute and I like to eat them. Especially with pumpkinny Indian spices. Oh, and balls. http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
Is there anything nerdier than rockin' out in your in car to a glee club version of "Golddigger?" No. No, there is not. #nerdcred
Today is kicking my ass.
@porkrind I had Indian food for the first time last night and loved it. Will be blogging about it tonight!
@hswell I would like to hear more about this band situation. Your stories are always awesome.
@ashleymc For reals. If you love a good grilled cheese, go to Tastebud's in Urbandale. Froccia, three cheeses, tomato, toasted. #cheesecoma
@Corycm I want to do wine drinking. There is pretty much never a time I don't want to do wine drinking. #wineup
@lrafdal Yeah, pretty much any weather is good for wine drinking. But cab seems extra perfect when it's yucky out.
@frojive Veggie balls = tasty. Thanks for the recommendation.
@DSMJSM Mini-lamb burgers? They sound amazing! Thanks for the blog comments, and the recipe!
Cabernet goes great with a rainy day.
@frojive Veggie balls! I will order that for the awesome name alone!
@sewzinski Aces!

@Corycm So much awesomeness, with the non-expiration, the participating humans and hugs that are better than drugs. #mustbeahellovahug

@mkeller10 So true. It's completely changed the way I listen to music. Sometime a song comes up and I have no idea who the artist is.
@Solo_Jeff Riedel glasses are magic. I only have a few but I loves them!
This week is flying by. And I like it!
@thrillcat Oh, mice are scary. They look all cute and non-terrifying, but they are tricksters. That's the scary part.
A mouse just peeked out of a bankers box handle at me. It was terrifying.
Ghostbusters on AMC. Rad. That'll totally hold me over until #glee.
You are on camera. For god sake, spit your gum out. Also you are not in junior high. I heart logging footage.

@Corycm Don't have the whole album, it's on my to buy list. Beth covering a 5 'o clock shadowed, white suited George Michael is perfection.
@hswell Hooray! By then, we'll all lose track of time and he'll stay longer. Strategy! And tippytoe!
@hswell @sewzinski No Matt? I do not approve. Please fix this.
The Gossip's cover of "Careless Whisper" makes me terribly happy.

@sewzinski Fo' sho. Um, yo. A round of monkey heads sounds rad.
@sewzinski You're a foxy lady. I'm pretty much always jealous of your hair.
@susanlu Ha! Totally. Also, digital does not equal HD. #conversationsihavedaily
I'm digitizing from a VHS today. That's right. Vee. Aich. Ess. I'm totally living in the future. The future of 1979. Which would be 1983.

Just about every house on my street is sporting a decorative bale of hay. I refuse to participate in such nonsense.

@sewzinski @hswell I've only played mah jong on the 'puter, but I like it. I also like drinking. And am totally willing to write an essay.
@sewzinski Crafty classes?  I am a major sufferer of craft anxiety. Will there be pills for that?

@sewzinski @susanlu the vulture picture, read What is a What by Dave Eggers. A must read about one of the Lost Boys of Sudan. Heartbreaking.
Tres jealous of @lennykoggins. She just hit the motherlode of @TempltonRye, in Chicago. #buyitall
@amywright There's probably good reason for that. Like maybe the creepy factor. And the puppets. They'll eventually come to life and kill u.

I appreciate people not being late. But always showing up 10-15 minutes early is equally annoying.

Fall is here! Fall is here! I'm wearing boots today, so it's official!
@sewzinski Fancy name for citirus? Yeah, I'll pay the extra ten bucks. Bergamont &gt; oranges.
@sewzinski I don't know, why would I throw sauerkraut? I've retold that story so many times you'd think it happened to me.
@sewzinski Just a quick mention that will confuse most, though I've told that story lots. When I think throw, I think Jim & kraut & a ghost.
@sewzinski Bergmont sounds fancy and intellectual. Which means I must have it. #pretentioushippy
@sewzinski btw, I mentioned you, Jim, and the sauerkraut throwing incident on the blog today.
@sewzinski Fresh has some sort of tobacco scent that sounds not good, but smells amazing. But maybe thats what you're already talking about.
Okay, dude. Turn around & watch the show. You're freaking us out. #noeyecontact
I have now heard an acoustic version of Maneater. number 36 on bucket list complee.
Dinner at @fongspizza then the Lisa Donnelly show at People's.
currently following ghostbusters car w/ cy paintjob. echo 1 coolest car ever.
@CatRocketship Across the Universe if so pretty! But so insanely horrible. The pretty only goes so far.
The only office beer we have is one Amber O'douls. a.) why does that exist? b.) this lack of beer is wack, yo.
@lrafdal Don't forget the cargo shorts, faux vintage t-shirt and a backpack purse.
@lrafdal I was a fan between the ages of 21-25. Now? Not so much. Boring. My tastes have evolved.
@Corycm Oh em gee. Just noticed your Skank Pitstick Flash Gordon tweet. That song is ridiculously awesome. So cheestastically awesome.
@lrafdal Oh yeah, I know. I want a mini jack.
@hswell Hmmm. Might make it there later. 'Sposed to have dinner w/ the Sahrmans at Sbrocco. Then @shortysbar. Perhaps some polka later.
@hswell Ugh, tres jealous. I can haz german beerz now instead of wurking? Happy bday to matt!
@lrafdal Um, I totally want one of those. I'm a tres nerdy anglophile who speaks frenglish.
@amywright Um, yeah. Dead from the hot.
@modcloth Quit Meshing Around Heels
If a guy wants to be Tom, he can be. It's just strange that he would say his name is Robert. My name is CourtneeCee, but I go by MaebyEf.
"My name is Robert, but I go by Tom." Um, no Robert, that's not how it works. You get Rob or you get Burt. Tom does not enter the equation.
@Corycm Exactly. The Adventures of Skank Pitstick should be a cartoon. A musical one. With robots.
Worst last name I've heard since Skank: Pitstick.
@chrissyjensen That video had me at Jon Hamm.
Have a feeling I would luck funny without eyes. And it would make work hard. Still thinking about scratching them out. #allergiesugh
@sewzinski Pics? Not sure I'm ready for that. Do love the bangs though. My forehead is all warm and cozy.
@lrafdal Ha! If only Nick Arojo had cut my hair.
I have fancy new bangs. There's no way they will look this cute when I attempt to style them on my own.
@richsommer Was that you taking a picture while on stage winning an emmy? Ha! And congrats.
@chrissyjensen I heart Dennis the Beeper King. Mr. Hamm goes without saying.
Bryan Cranston is lovely and talented, but I really need to see Jon Hamm up on stage right now. It's been like, 2.5 hours. #shallow
Oh, Orry Main. My favorite southern gentleman.
It always seems a little tacky that the death montage turns into a popularity contest.
Darlton in the audience!
Ben! Finally!
I find Jimmy Fallon to be rather unfunny. Ricky Gervais? Completely opposite.
@angatdorotheas True, the Edies are fabulous in any iteration.
@angatdorotheas Congrats! A dress of yours has officially been in an Emmy winning movie! #emmys09
Jessica Lange was sublime in Grey Gardens. And the old person makeup covered up her scary facelift. That forehead is frightening.
Captain Hammer, he's alive! And dreamy.
@angatdorotheas Yeah, there's no way she can breathe in that dress. #totallyokaytogoupasize
I'd like to think Brendan Gleeson is also winning for In Bruges. #totallyunderrated
Go Grey Gardens!!
That Chanel tv movie is nominated? Good god, that was a disaster. Pretty clothes, terrible movie. and yet I watched the whole thing.
@garlicgirl Seriously. Hayden Planetarium looks like she's pushing 40.
Generalissimo! And what's up with Rob Lowe's hair?
@chrissyjensen Next awards show. For reals.
Totally loving @hodgman 's color commentary...school of hard knocks. Ha! #emmys09
@chrissyjensen Ha! I don't know for sure, but I hope so!
@chrissyjensen Pretty sure he's just a regular dude.
@chrissyjensen Strawberries....and condoms!
Nobody should ever win anything for 2.5 men. Ugh. NPH & Tracy were robbed, yo. #emmys09
Oh, Olive Snook. How I've missed you. #emmys09
Seriously, E! It's Jon Hamm. Show him full screen, he's a handsome devil.
The cat is acting extra needy today.

@liabolicious Throngs of screaming teenagers don't do it for Josh Groban.
Going camping this weekend. Can't wait for today to be over.
I want to learn how to play the autoharp. It's one of my top 4 favorite instruments along with the accordion, bag pipes and mandolin.
@jen0423 I think she was actually serious, but it threw me off because it is exactly what the SNL target lady would say. "Score!"
@modcloth stable girl dress
@modcloth stable girl dress??
Target checker lady: "Oh, so pretty! And on sale too!" I'm 95% sure she was sincere.
@amywright Happy anniversary!
@hswell You should talk to the production coordinator or something? 4:30 am is dumb, and should never be witnessed.
@lennykoggins No! And I still wouldn't eat bulls balls. I'd take a stick to the eye everytime. Unless eating them got me a trip to London.
"The way you use your mental illness to help these kids is really inspiring." Can I be Jane Lynch when I grow up? #glee
Padma needs a stylist. The woman cannot dress herself.
Why, hello creativity. So nice of you to join me. Where the ef have you been all week?
@sewzinski Seriously, she's a whore. And Gretchen Wieners told me she's cheating on Aaron Samuels! AND SHE'S FAT! #meangirl
Wordpress is being kind of an asshole tonight.
Wearing my "Crazy for Swayze" shirt today.
Settling in for Deadwood and Draper. I heart Sundays.
New blog post. Wrapping up 'eat local' resolution. One of my faves. Ate lots o' healthy fresh food. http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
oh, college bars. you are lame. and i am old.
the game wasn't great, but day drinking is always a crowd pleaser.
It'd be a whole lot cooler if they were playing the Glee version of Don't stop believin'.
Never thought i'd hear a marching band play a britney spears tune.
Toasty in the stands. good chance a fight will break ou in this section.
College football and bloody marys go together like peas and carrots.
Up early for saturday. One cup of coffee, then tailgating and bloody marys.
They're testing the beer goggles myth on Mythbusters. Outcome: plausible. Hilarious. Yes, I'm watching Mythbusters on a Friday night. #nerd
@BalletDM 2 FREE tickets to see The Joffrey Ballet at the Civic Center 8pm tonight! DM/RT to enter! Winner will be announced this afternoon
@grantkimm So, how do you reconcile your hawkeye-ness and your current employment situation??
three grown women & we all have our noses in our phones. reverting to junior high?
drinking a monkeyhead with my favorite girls @hswell & @kimall4paws
witnessing a heartfelt interpretive email reading by @hswell. brilliant.
Forty minutes 'til Fongs!
@modcloth party favor necklace
Ready for fall weather, & most importantly boots. Had my Frye's on this morning willing the weather to cool. Didn't work. Wearing sandals.
@Suzika That color is amazing. Buy those. And pick a pair up for me too! 8.5, please.
GLEE!!!
@porkrind Giving up caffeine is heinous. Did it for a week once. Wanted to kill myself on days 3 & 4. Good luck!
@Brianne_Sanchez Great article! I'm doing eat local week as my resolution on my blog this week. Definitely linking the story if that's cool.
My mind, she is blown. #ingloriousbasterds
Waiting for inglorious basterds to start. a little thrown off by the crowd. someone might have a heartattack
I need to have Anthony Bourdain's job. Either that or become his travel companion. Who can make this happen?
Back on the sauce! And by sauce I mean @templetonrye http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
sittin' in the backyard around the firepit. gorgeous night!
Go check out @sewzinski's insanely rad wallets at www.sewZinski.etsy.com. Like, right now. You won't be sorry, they are made of awesome.
@soZealous Love it! The random shoppers strolling around are hilarious.
@nathantwright Not a dog, but don't forget about Mr. Friskerton over at @catcapes! For all your cat's super hero costume needs!
Oh, pumpkin latte, thank you for coming back into my life. I have missed you so.
@amywright I know, right? We didn't want to make it too easy. Was ready for the holiday weekend, but football w/o beer? Dumb.
Hey, a band plays at these games. usually in the lot w/ a beer. stupid resolution.
Getting ready to head up to Ames! Stupid no drinking resolution.  http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
@lrafdal Have you had the Nerd rope before? It is...odd. The gel center is a little scary.
@amyraelle OMG! Someone else over the age of 14 who knows Penny & Me? I unironically adore that song. Drowning pain in lemonade? Genius.
New music needed for this spot. Starting from scratch.
Glee! You know what's tough? Waterboarding. That's tough.
Have a bit of editor's block. Feeling frustrated, unsure of my skillz, struggling with footage. #creativecliche
@hswell was already my hero. After that iced latte run, I believe I will make her my personal savior.
@nursebear No, because that drink is perfection!
@sewzinski  We don't even have to put the Cienzo on the phone. If one of us is on it. She's talkin' in the background. Loudly. And a lot.
@KevinMcCarthy I'm oddly happy to hear you refer to MJH's eye as wonky. Some friends and I call her the Wonkster. It's mean, but true.
@CassidyFletcher Looking forward to funky outfit goodness!
@Corycm @sewzinski  RE: phantom kitties, e1 recently asked me if I ever hear 'phantom meows' when I'm not home. I don't. He does.
@TobyFunke Well played, sir. (re: the duggar freakshow)
@abbieshipton Ha! That's adorable. Expressive eyebrows, that one.
My daily Today show complaint. Why do they continue to feature those creepy Duggars? Big news? Let me guess. Someone's knocked up. Again.
@lrafdal Does acapella have a season? Does @mkeller10 have season tickets?
@Peteness Swell. I'm sure she's qualified. I should switch up my routine, CNN is too dry, Diane Sawyer grates.
One of the 'news anchors' on the Today show won an emmy for best gameshow host. That says so much...why do I still watch this?
@Suzika Yes please! Currently in desperate need of a bloody mary.
@HollyEgg Ha! We're just close enough to hear a little bit of the drumline rumbling. Reminds me early bird band many years ago. #bandgeek
@tvoti At least you have the sausage races. People running while dressed up as tubed meat? Never not awesome.
Kinda love hearing the Skankeny HS marching band practicing in the morning. Another sign of fall!
Mad Men and @TempletonRye...excellent combination.
Drew Barrymore was far better in Grey Gardens than I was expecting. Jessica Lang was divine. Glad I'm wearing the best costume for the day.
Champagne, ice cream, the house to myself and Grey Gardens = fab night in. Should probably take @hswell 's advice wear a sweater on my head.
@susanlu Thanks for the your gardening help! That worm is hella creepy. He is not my friend, and I will dispose of him. Ew.
Also, why are my full sized tomatoes splitting? @amandazinger?
http://twitpic.com/fpvf5 - Anybody know what this creepy thing on my grape tomato plant is?
@BornLiar Fight club? Totally over rated. That's right, I said it.
@Pegasus515 Who learned you that info? Creepy co-worker? It's also from a kids movie. Perhaps you dress up like Lava Girl on occasion?
@sewzinski We should totally get them together before then. If it weren't for Jim at @hswell's party, e1 wouldln't be a Guitar Hero addict.
@bornliar oh, and @sew.zinski will also be there. Score!
@BornLiar I don't know about rolls, but I'm definitely bringing water. And I expect you to pay for it. 10.17 btw.
Also RE: tailgating, @bornliar may be happy to hear that Murph will be at the AAT ISU tailgate. Yes, that Murph.
@sewzinski Oh, e1 will be at the tailgating. He tailgates like it's his job.
@sewzinski @hswell I have a hot date planned with a bottle of champagne and Grey Gardens, but I just might make it there too.
@sewzinski Cocktail? You shoulda joined @hswell and i for lunch.
Someone might get kicked in the mullet.
@hswell @sewzinski Other than creepy middle aged fanboy lusting after not-quite legals, Shark Boy? Whatever that is.
@hswell Um, yeah. Especially when he's already drooling about the slave girls. Ew. #keepthatshittoyourself
@hswell Oh god, I can only imagine.
@nathantwright Why do you want to hurt me? I'm cutting you up right now, contemplating a large SAARS! graphic at the beginning. Thoughts?
I like the rain.
@sewzinski If you were ever operating at full capacity, you would surely explode. I'm sure of it.
I heart whoever invented the caprese salad.
We have a contest wiener, er, winner! http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com
@peoplemag And with a tweet that supports the Spencer & Heidi and is proud of it, I must unfollow you. Good bye.
Is Ann Curry trying to beat some sort of words per minute record? The Today Show annoys me so much. And yet I have it on every morning.
@Corycm Mad chedda? I was thinking more a bold jarlsburg. Regardless, cheese on the wallet, and probably in as well.
@sewzinski I want that. Also would like to discuss a wallet with cheese on it.
Ten minutes 'til Draper!
Adventures in Babysitting! Nobody leaves this place without singin' the blues...

Watching @donttrythis sinking a car into water. My claustrophobic nightmare.
@bornliar guest blogging over at Fifty2 Resolutions. And there's a contest! Everyone loves contests! http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
Drat! @bornliar totally stole my pickle dog thunder!
Forcing cold symptoms in to submission for Kelly Clarkson!
Porn stash or 'stache? You decide. Either way this guy's super klassy! http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
@BornLiar Thanks for the tip. Do they have a couch delivery service?
I am in the market for a new immune system. Mine is broken. Willing to pay good money. No questions asked.
@Pegasus515 But I owe you! You were so generous last time, it would be rude of me not to. Let's share some coffee tomorrow.
Just opened my first jar of homemade pickles...and they're tasty! And spicy.
@chrissyjensen Hooray! Totally deserved.  http://ow.ly/kCP8

Getting a sore throat. Always leads to a cold. Not pleased.
Pics from my sis, @lennykoggins, wedding http://tinyurl.com/nral5d  Decorations by @sewzinski & @hswell!
@soZealous Nice. Thanks!

Gloomy days always steer me toward Radiohead. Ergo, gloomy days are good days.

@daniAWESOME So true. Though I do talk to my friend/gyno about the pill while wearing club clothes and drinking martinis at a bar.
If you're organizing an event, you need to know @hswell & @sewzinski.They do amazing work designing and decorating. Plus they're rad ladies.
Back in Walcott, ready for @lennykoggins wedding shenanigans to begin. Tonight...cookout!
@Corycm When's he in d-port?
@corycm @sewzinski Sedaris? No question. SEE HIM. So amazing to listen to him read. Plus, he called my friend and I 'foxes' #deadfromawesome
@lrafdal It's kind of my new thing to say when I'm being cagey...though it did stem from an actual woodchuck being in a flower pot.
The woodchuck is in the flowerpot...
@angatdorotheas I love bangs! But my stylist talked me out of a big change days before my sis's wedding. And mentioned my small forehead.
You know, I get that there will always be porn bots, but they could at least attempt to be creative, right?
I am sans bangs. My stylist is good and talking me off the ledge. I will have bangs soon, but not just yet.
@sewzinski Um, yes? I know it seems like maybe a bad idea. I think I need a little bang w/ an updo. Like Michelle Williams at the oscars '06
The machines are rising up against us here. Michael will be killed by a disc printer. A crappy piece of freeware will be my demise.
@sewzinski Bangs??
@CassidyFletcher Bangs or not, I'd take your hair any day. You have rockstar hair. I'm tres jealous.
@HollyEgg I kinda have bangs now, but at the moment, they are long and unruly.
Probably not a good idea to make a hair change days before @lennykoggins wedding. But I'm in desperate need of cute bangs.
@Corycm Ugh. The meddling kids. I will cut them if they screw with me today.
Everything will go as planned today. It must.
@sewzinski I sneeze twice every afternoon. Always sometime between 2:30 and 3:30.
b. & c. running late today...R/T @Fifty2Res New resolution is up! http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com
Deadwood time. Doc Cochran's gonna make Jewel a gimpy boot! And the hot bagman is in town.
Cooking my first ever Julia Childs recipe...baked cucumbers.
The clouds in the front of my house are moving in a different direction than the ones behind it.
@lrafdal Wow. Were you on a roadtrip to hell?
Attempting to make pickles.
@lrafdal Which is precisely why one should not listen to the radio. #angermanagement
Got a sharp headache while ellipticalling. Like I need another reason not to work out. #solazy
@Corycm Can I be pikachu? #onlythingiknowaboutpokeman
@HollyEgg Nice meeting you too!
So, SNL...people still watch this? Why?
I heart the mandolin.
@sewzinski Have @hswell text me when/if you guys beer bash. Gonna take it easy tonight and may just do a pop-in at the beer  festivities.
Trailer #2 for "Where the Wild Things Are." Want to see NOW! http://tinyurl.com/mfhsfc
@BornLiar Both? That would cause machine failure due to too much awesome.
@BornLiar @hswell I'm attempting to clockwipe to 5 as I type. I'd be willing to montage to 5 too if necessary. Dance or training montage?
@BornLiar @hswell I would use clockwipes on every project if it were considered socially acceptable. #lazyeditor
@BornLiar @hswell Whatever. You're king of the montages. And romance movie writing.
@frojive @hswell @bornliar @Kathy_L Yay for team A Sense Of Urgency making the top 15. Also congrats to @SoZealous & Napkin Sketch! #48Hour

@SophiaAhmad That doesn't change the fact that I'd like hear a wild rendition of 'thank you for bein' a frieeennndddd!'
Being a tourist in my own city this week. Any suggestions for obscure Des Moines landmarks? http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
@SophiaAhmad A remix of the Golden Girl theme? A song like that definitely deserves to go public!
@sewzinski I need to get back on the jillian train too. I think she hates knees. Mine get a little hurty too.
@sewzinski I'm all about magical @catcapes, however, I lack mad skillz when it comes to crafty endeavors.
@sewzinski @amywright I am ready to help in the making of @catcapes! I'm not crafty, but can buy booze & drop cats from high places to test.
@grantkimm Exactly. Ugh.
My face is like an oil slick. And not the good kind where you make a bunch of money and drink other people's milkshakes.

Ramping up for #48Hour viewing at the Fleur. Go see group C and vote for "Expiration Dates." You know zombies are the coolest thing ever.
@sewzinski @hswell re: beer bash, @Pegasus515 will be there too. He will probably get in a fight. Or get sick.

Apparently I shoulda been on twitter earlier tonight. That way I wouldn't have forgotten to tivo Michael & Michael have issues. #MMHI
@BornLiar I have three words for you: Five Hour Energy...oh, wait...that's only two.
@sewzinski Damn! We shoulda had monkeyheads for lunch. Your brain would still be drippy, but it'd be a pretty blue color.
Hungry. Need cheese.
R/T @awesome_andrea4 8-hour film fest tonight & tomorrow night at the Fleur Cinema. Root for "Expiration Dates" on Thursday night!
@chrissyjensen Sweet...so she should be here in three days or so. #slowmail	#@brendasfaketwitteraccount
@sewzinski Dude, I'm in. And in need of monkeyhead juice in a bad way.
@BornLiar So you're pretty much living the weekend schedule all over again. But with less makeup and fewer cocoa puffs.
@sewzinski If Brenda was on twitter I might drink more and there's nothing bad about that.
Tacos with tomato, cilantro, banana peppers and habeneros from the garden. Delish.
Team A Sense of Urgency's #48Hour film is up! Watch it or @Kathy_L will bite you.  http://bit.ly/12S9GX

@Jensenrf Oh, Walcott. There's no place like home.
Tired. Case of the Mondays. Venti lattee, work your magic. Now, please.
@frojive My part isn't the hardest, just last, so a bit hectic. Unless we're talking about boom mic operator. Then yes, that is the hardest.
@amywright Yes, sleep. It would be nice to get the amount of sleep in got the last two nights all in one night.
http://twitpic.com/brlo1 - Zombie movie, I made it with my friends, @hswell, @bornliar, @kathy_l, @frojive, @amywright

Oh, hi team. It's so nice to see you. Wait, you mean you're not here? I hadn't noticed. EXCEPT FOR I TOTALLY DID! #48Hour

Doing a music library search & came across some corporate hip-hop. Really? There's no way that's good.
@mkeller10 Great track. My fave on this album. Have we discussed my tenuous relationship with Fleetwood Mac?
Loving the new Matthew Sweet/Susana Hoffs collaboration. So 70's. So poppy.
@fuggirls Totally. The best time to shop is back to school. the browns, the plaids, the jackets! Even better? Not having to go to shcool.

'Bear with me' seems to be the fill in the silence phrase most often used by Qwest customer service. 8 times in 12 minutes so far.
@Corycm I swear my coffee level is monitored. When I refill theres always just enuf left in the pot for 1 more cup, so I have to make more.
There is a coffee conspiracy going on around here. I'm sure of it. #notparanoid
@BornLiar I'm sorry, I don't comprehend what you're saying. I'm pretty sure you're wrong though. Mi Mexico Margs = good any time

I got up at 5:30 to hit the gym before work and I'm not sleepy. Quite an accomplishment. http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
If I'm eating lunch at my desk, please politely offer to come back later. Do not try to have a conversation w/ me when my mouth is full.
@Pegasus515 Oh no! What will you do with your day if you can't have your nose all up in your iphone?? Three hour lunch, maybe?
@Corycm That one's my all time fave. Tied w/ the season 2 christmas episode. The first couple seasons are perfection.
@schippers My sister does too. Strongly considering buying the Shamwow she registered for.
Um, @Todayshow, I don't think you can keep calling the MJ hair on fire clip 'never seen before' after showing it 3 times. It's been seen, 3x
@sewzinski 'Tis a tragedy that more people don't know that movie. Now finish up them taters, I'm gonna go fondle my sweaters.
@mshowalter Loved the show! Fatal Sweater IV gave me nightmares.
Not getting sucked in to the West Wing on Bravo in the mornings is a struggle. Especially now that seaon 2 has started.
@sewzinski I liked Michael & Michael, but their schtick def isn't for everybody. Very Stella-esque. WHAS is one of my all time faves.
@Corycm No love for the flailing shirtless dance fight? Fatal Sweater IV? I heart the Michaels.
I might have nightmares about Fatal Sweater IV. #michaelandmichael
@amywright Catcape? I could totally use one of those. But where ever would I find one?
@hswell @rootleveldesign  Our camping trip with the MAFIA just popped in my head for some reason. Let's visit Katherine in the big city.
R/T @Fifty2res: b. got joggy with it. http://fifty2resolutions.wo...
So, apparently my emails haven't been going out all week. And yet the junk mail always manages to find it's way in. Dumb.
It's kinda hard to take a blog seriously when it is full of emoticons. Ew.
@jen0423 Here's hoping! And I prefer Gladiator era Crowe to, well, almost everything after that Crowe.
I'm wearing my gladiator sandals and am therefore prepared to fight tigers. Or some Romans or whatever.
Added jalapenos and banana peppers from the garden to my Papa Murphy's tomato, mushroom and garlic pizza. So delicious.
Heading to the gym for day 2 of Week 27 Resolution: http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
why does it seem like's it's already Thursday?
@BornLiar Blame it on the raccoon at my office. It's usually his fault.

Running around town with the family. Attempting to bring @sewzinski 's brilliant plans to life.
@nathantwright Damn, you're quick. Can't wait until @catcapes kicks off. It will be cat-tacular...or something. Awkward paws!! meow.
Bad at making friends? Photoshop helps. http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com
@jen0423 Yeah, it's a nice perk.
Just drank a concoction made from booze found in work closet. Red bull, blue curacao, gin, white rum and malibu. Not as bad as you'd think.
@sewzinski Got it. I however, do both. Have a tramp stamp of a bag of Sabor de Soledad that I cover with my mom jeans. Cowboy hat optional.
@sewzinski Curious as to what this was in reply to: @porkrind @ericspencer1 that was a picture of when @CourtneeCee was 12! Gimme a break
Dude, do not touch the top of my head. Not cool. Not ever.
Getting lots of french porn spam on the blog lately. Je n'adore pas. Je m'appelle monique. J'adore le bibliotheque. I'm great at french.
Um, when did it become 10pm outside?
@sewzinski Our mom and dad owned halloween. Made us the best costumes ever.
@sewzinski You will heart the crayon box, super crafty. Our best was me as toothy fairy, b. as a tooth, but no photos.
Blog's done with twelve minutes to spare. Behold, the highest waisted jeans ever. http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
@sewzinski On it! Not only were we crayons, we were in a box. I was yellow, @lennykoggins was pink, I think.
@sewzinski Oh, I wish! There are existing pics of me dress as the following: raggedy Anne, Strawberry Shortcake, a sad rabbit, a crayon.
@sewzinski Dude, now that I've made promises, I can't find the effing pic on my computer. Blurg!
@BornLiar Holla! Beer usually makes me blog better, but now I can't find the bad cowboy boots pic. Help needed. Something w/ jazz hands.
Totally gonna get this blog done before the end of the day. Young @courtneecee in bad jeans and cowboy boots on the way.
@BornLiar Have you tivo talk to my tivo. I can haz hd, plz.
Just got my hairs did. Getting ready to head to Skankeny summerfest with the neighbor ladies.
In love with Jenny Lewis' new video for "See Fernando." http://vimeo.com/5514928
@sewzinski yeah, she's tres bizzay. Last time she's in the QC before the wedding shindig.
@sewzinski Aw, me too! @lennykoggins will be in d-port that night...perhaps we can persuade her to drive an extra 2.5hrs to booze w/ us.
@BornLiar @sewzinski @hswell Who knew the Virgin Mary was also the patron saint of safe driving?
@BornLiar Yes, a donkey named Pablo will meet you in Juarez w/ final instructions.  Remember, no chicken imitations. The locals no like.
@frojive Hope she's okay!
This coffee is an abomination. My taste buds are offended.
Okay @todayshow, can we give the MJ coverage a rest? Is burial location really first story of the day worthy at this point?
@amywright So, does that mean you will booze with us, Ms. Danger? Say yes now.
@sewzinski Sadly, no. It was a figment of our collective imaginations.
@sewzinski @bornliar @hswell They will steal things from families, take a kitchen tour and catch the bus for a ride home.
@sewzinski Yessir, m'lady.
@sewzinski @HollyEgg and I vote for Mi Mexico. Best and most likely to end in chaos and theft margaritas in town.
@BornLiar @sewzinski @Hswell Um, that's still being decided. Has Mi Mexico been thrown into the fray? Delicious, but dangerous. #margaritas
@sewzinski Lizzing, ha! And preferable to Jacking. LEMON OUT!
Best, and most honest pic ever taken of @lennykoggins and I. Except for the one with Care Bears. http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
@grantkimm Fo' sho'. But won't it scare your kids. Assuming the child in the jaunty hat is one of yours? The one that rides in the carseat?
@Corycm @sewzinski WDM is just so...shiny. Also prefer my downtown spots. Or any random dive.
@tommy_dalton I totally want a rug with a lady head.
@sewzinski Not trying to back out. Just expect my usual level of social awkwardness. No suggestions for WDM, I try not to go there much.
@HollyEgg We must be communication soul mates. I prefer to hide behind machines as well.
Just got back from the Dr. New location = ton of paperwork. Why don't they use those handy inventions called computers?
@sewzinski Dude, I wish I had a regular massage therapist. Only time I go is when I have a certificate. Think @hswell has someone new, tho.
@Suzika Aww, thanks, dear. We miss her. The blog has been a fun way to remember her and raise money and awareness.
New blog post, 'Who I want to be when I grow up.' Miss you, Shelly. http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
Quit after Deadwood, but might have to pickup HBO again. RT @The_AV_Club Middlesex to become an HBO series. http://tinyurl.com/l7gp2q
@Pegasus515 An awesome designer, of course. Any randomly floating logos or disembodied coaches or featured parking lots? #crappydesign
@amywright @bornliar Nothing is better than DMLG & his love of that name. Seems drinks are being arranged for Friday? Come, I miss u.
@abbieshipton Ugh. Cringing for you! Nothing worse than not being able to take drugs for a migraine. Dark room, cold cloth on the head.
@HollyEgg Downtown Ames. It's gigantic. Room after room of cool old stuff. You could totally get lost.
@HollyEgg You and be both, sister. I love looking through all the old crap there. Also Ames Antiques.
@BornLiar You are "Des Moines' Little Gem" after all.
@HollyEgg Is one of those the crazy antique place with barns full of stuff & old metal outdoor decor everywhere? I've found good stuff there
@Etsy I've purchased a few things from DazeyChic in the past! So happy to hear her Etsy business is a success!
@nathantwright @hswell @sewzinski Referring to @bornliar as "des moines' little gem" also works. Or the possibility of bus pickup afterwards
@sewzinski Thats the case for you, for me it was mentions of foot fetish & Phil Mickelson's man boobs. Attracted a specific type of follower
@sewzinski @Corycm And naked vs. nekkid = yeah, I'll be there. (we're all gonna attract porny followers now, u know. Its happened to me b4.)
@Corycm I can't say for sure that I'll be there, but it's highly likely. Naked, sailor chasing @sewzinski ups those odds.
@sewzinski You better leave, (meow), my kitten alone. (meow)
I skipped tv last week. Just turned it back on for the first time. Still talking MJ. So, I didn't miss anything...http://tinyurl.com/npwssz
@sewzinski Hey, thanks for the mention. You're pretty and nice.
will miss the cocksuckers, hoopleheads & whores on Deadwood tonight. Should start a band w/ that name! fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
@sewzinski Potentially doable. Will report back.
Perfecting the fried egg sandwich. Egg, fresh parsley, ham, avocado, cheese, a little mayo, english muffin and a side of coffee.
My cilantro plants are growing like crazy. Therefore everything I cook has cilantro in it now. It doesn't always work out.
@sewzinski Always great marathons on holiday weekend. Too bad me and tv are still broken up.
You wouldn't think it'd be hard to not watch tv over the holiday weekend. But there are marathons! http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
@Corycm Intriguing...perhaps I'll stop by the wine shop next week. Let me know when you're there!
Fried egg sandwich on english muffin was super tasty. Not quite as good as Gateway, but close.
Attempting to recreate Gateway Market's Fried Egg Sandwich at home. Have you had it? It is life changing. Not kidding.
If @sewzinski were to have a twittervention, the interwebs would be far more boring.
@sewzinski Get to stichin', yo.
Just witnessed three divorcees competing for a mildly attractive newly separated friend of mine. Oh, intrigue.
@sewzinski 36 or so.
@sewzinski There are very few people I'd share my boyfriend with...but you @hswell are always welcome to take advantage of him.
@sewzinski Probably good you're not feelin' the Arby's. Remember to ask me about the story e2/ @esahrmann once told me. Ew.
Raspberry vodka + lemonade is my boyfriend.
@lennykoggins True.Thought there was only a glass left in the bottle, until I topped it off & filled the entire glass. Distracted me from tv
@fawnita5 Feeling better now? Yes.
Firecrackers...seriously? Blurg. #apparentlyiamold.
How did a glass of wine turn into half a bottle. While alone. Problem??
Itunes is totally favoring Coldplay and the Jackson 5 tonight.
Not watching tv for a week is whack, but a little air guitar helps. http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com
@sewzinski It's impossible not to get along with you, lady friend.
I don't care for gangster rap, (which is obvious by my use of gangster instead of gangsta) but Ben Folds makes it sound charming.
Screened in porch, watching the sunset, listening to some mellow tunes and blogging. http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
@sewzinski But they look super cute on you so it's a win-win.
@BornLiar with @sewzinkski and @hswell led by @Corycm, that is.
@BornLiar Wine boozing.
@Corycm Another thing we agree on. I do not care for the fair. There aren't many of us.
@sewzinski Perhaps they'll just think you're an understudy for the Blue Man Group, much like Tobias Funke was when he blue himself.
@sewzinski @Corycm Sounds good. @bornliar could also be (very easily) swayed to attend such an event.
@CassidyFletcher Ugh, so sorry about your non-fun. Would it help if I told you that you're pretty and nice? I'd buy you a cupcake if I could
@sewzinski I think it might be time for us to set up a private tasting w/ @Corycm.
Sometimes it's necessary to take a 3 hour margarita lunch with the best client ever.
@VisitQuadCities I adore Blue Cat, Front Street & the Redstone Room. I just wish downtown was more vibrant outside of special events.
@Corycm I haven't lived in the QC for ages. I used to visit Gendlers(?) w/ my parents on occasion. Originally from Walcott, you?
@Corycm Yeah, it really is. Every time I go back home it looks worse. It's like the whole area is falling into disrepair.
@angatdorotheas Seriously. That dress was so much cuter before Andi effed it up.
@Jensenrf When I was a kid I was convinced Chevy Chase sang "You Can Call Me Al." Had now idea who the short guy in the video was.
@daynegerous I'm glad the TrashOut guys were able to help you out!
is giving up TV this week. This may be the resolution that breaks me. http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com
@daynegerous A guy I know has a company, TrashOut, in Ankeny I'm pretty sure they do that. Nate Miller  494-9411
There's a wide range of normal...
I totally made the backyard my bitch.
Perfect night for beers outside with neighbors.
Away We Go is a lovely movie. I little bit of quirk-overload, but still good.
@sewzinski Day four and the abs still don't come for free. Truth be told, I kinda half assed it today.
@garlicgirl I seem to remember you mentioning you collect old cookbooks. Calypso has a bunch of new old ones!
Somehow a meeting I have nothing to do with has cropped up in my edit suite. How does that happen? I do not approve.
I know bitching about the weather on twitter isn't terribly original, but seriously. I do not approve.
@sewzinski You should be a little scared. She''ll cut a bitch. Not that you're a bitch, I (I mean she) likes that expression.
@sewzinski She'll totally pull out the cutoffs and crop top for that. She'd even bring some homemade moonshine and a jello salad.
My sis and I are still working on our 52 Resolutions, stuff we can do for a short amount of time, but not a year. http://tinyurl.com/npwssz
@sewzinski Did you know that Coutnee (no 'r') is my white trash alter ego? She eats fried chicken and has a baby named Destiny.
@sewzinski Day two done. I'm well on my way to being shredded.
Super late start on Resolution #24. This week...compliment strangers! http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
@KevinMcCarthy Why would you want to stop? K. I. D. S. Yeah!
@soZealous Did you like 'Middlesex?' I loved it. One of my favorite books I've read in the last five years or so.
@sewzinski Um, because tanning won't get your ass shredded...though it does sound like the more enjoyable option.
Deadwood makes me so happy. It's the hoopleheads.
@mindykaling You and me both, sister. The first four seasons are perfect television. Beyond that, eh.
Oliver! on the Reelz channel. Oh, Artful Dodger, my first crush. Takes finesse to pull of a dingy top hat.
Finishing the bottle of Lambic Pomme and a blog post.
@sewzinski We were going to but had just bought huge iced teas and weren't sure we could take 'em in. Next time, for sure.
West Glen farmer's market, Gateway for lunch and cheese shopping, Architectural Salvage, Dos Rios Sangria and guac, home. Nice Saturday.
Mom and dad are here now. Hurrah! Now my mom can fix my garden!
@nathantwright Well done. He was excellent in Shattered Glass. He's one of my faves.
@Jensenrf You're right...there aren't very many of us. I'm like the elder stateswoman of West High twitterfolk. I don' think I like that.
@Jensenrf Yay! A fellow falcon...though you were there much later than me.
Drinking wine, watching Colbert, reading Deadwood reviews on the @The_AV_Club. Oh, relaxation...so nice to see you again.
@sewzinski It'll distract you for a little while, but eventually you'll start thinking Saars is the doppleganger not @nathantwright.
@sewzinski Yeah, @nathantwright is totally a Saars doppleganger.
Waiting for mom and dad to arrive. Eating cheese. Pretty much always eating cheese.
My garden gnome, Al, has been on such wonderful adventures! http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
@sewzinski Hey, I thought we were in this Jillian shit together...except for the part where I'm not starting again for two more days.
The cat chasing her tail never gets old.
Just added myself to http://alumtweet.com - West High School '94  and University of Northern Iowa '97
@grantkimm Yikes! Skankeny as mad windy last night. Thought my house was gonna blow over.
Darlton are judges on Top Chef. Yay!
I feel like I'm too grown up still enjoy Totino's Party Pizzas, and yet I love them.
Can't decide which cab I'd rather be in. Cash Cab or the one where the cabbie cranks to tunes and sings along.
New episodes of Better Off Ted all summer? Super rad!
@hswell Sitdown dinner?! I'm tres jealous. Were  you able to make anyone fell inadequate in the process?
@barenakedladies 'Bout time you came to Iowa. Will there be floor hockey?
Must remember not to tweet about squicky stuff, even as a joke. Always end up attracting creepy followers. BLOCK!
@sewzinski A bouncer would be awesome. And obnoxious hand stamps too! And drink specials.
I was just accosted by a sales person randomly walking around inside our building. How does that happen?
@hswell Too bad you're gone. Your favorite set of finger guns is in the hus.
I don't collude or cahoot. Me neither, Al. Me neither.
So pleased to have Deadwood back on Sunday nights. Thanks, Channel 101! Happy to have Sweargen and the boys swearing it up like old times.
Last day of 'be a vegetarian week.' Whipping up  black bean & pumpkin soup. Santogold providing soundtrack. fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com
Avocado mango salsa wraps. This vegetarian business is working out nice.
Searching interwebs for Apple-Gruy√®re Pie recipes to mourn the last episode of Pushing Daisies tonight.
Was excited to win free tix to the @coldplay show yesterday, and they far exceeded my expectations. Great show!
I have done nothing but compress files today. It is not exciting. The free Coldplay tickets more than make up for that.
@8035 Can I change my answer? Dangerous, not douglas is my submission.
@8035 Douglas
@KevinMcCarthy I'm a vegetarian this week and there seems to be a lot of fake meat in loaf form. Ew. Thanks for tix!
@Tim_DigitalArts Okay, you got me there.
@sewzinski Don't joke, you know how I feel about Velveeta, sister.
I don't care much for anything that comes in loaf form.
@angatdorotheas Fantastic, congrats!
Oh, Avid. Please export faster, Jimmy John's is waiting for me.
@nathantwright Happy birthday, Saars.
@KevinMcCarthy For reals?? That's super sweet, thanks!!
I am far too excited that @The_AV_Club  is recapping The West Wing & Deadwood this summer. Two of my faves. #iamwaytoogeeky
@amywright Thing is, it's a really lame & boring video. If I'm gonna be associated w/ a fetish, I want it to be cool or exciting or dirty.
@amywright I am? Does that have anything to do with my appearance on a foot fetish website?
Just got @replied to by Peter Sagal of Wait, Wait Don't Tell Me. Geek freakout!
@petersagal Jem is fantastic, though Jem is a she and not a band. Unless you're referring to Jem & The Holograms, who are truly outrageous.
@alexson And when talking about bologna, I would think it should be "meat," in quotes. Bologna = ew.
Veggie week isn't going too bad. But my burger was chunky. http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
The master chefs have no idea how to use a microwave. So cute.
Love the master chefs on Top Chef cooking in a dorm room, but I miss Tom, Gail and Padma. And I could use a little Ted too.
@sewzinski I'd totally be on board with a world ruled by you and @hswell. It'd look really cool and have delicious cocktails. And kittens!
Saw friend of a friend Lisa Donnelly last night at Taft's. Great singer/songwriter! Check her out! http://www.lisadonnelly.com/
Whoa, when did it become 5? Gotta get ready for golf w/ @DSMGolfLessons, then the Lisa Donnelly show at Tafts. Love her tunes.
@lrafdal Finally, I've been name-checked on the podcast! Looking forward to tonight's ep. Captain Keith's all choked up in the preview!
@hswell Yeah, but it's only Tuesday and I've already eaten some of my faves!
Eating vegetarian for Res 22. What are some great veggie dishes around town, DeMo tweeps? http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
@8035 weissenborn
Watching the 4th hour of the Today Show. It's even worse than the SNL spoof makes it look. Can't believe this is actually on network tv.
@Solo_Jeff Glad you found me. Sbrocco and Shorty's are two of my favorite places!
My day in haiku. http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
Just realized my 1,000th tweet was about DQ Blizzards. Well played, @CourtneeCee.
Will an oreo Blizzard be the cure for whatever cold/flu hell I'm suffering? Let's hope.
Oh Pushing Daisies, it's so good to see you again. Good, but bittersweet. I've missed you Olive Snook!
@Pegasus515 Have I told you lately that I hate you? Please refrain from licking my keyboard from now on.
@lrafdal If I buy a Rockapella cd, start worrying.
It is really inconvenient for me to be sick this weekend. Not to mention how nice out it is. Boo!
It's official, I'm sick. Thank god for the Golden Girls.
Really hope I'm developing allergies right now. Unfortunately, I think it's something more.
@sewzinski Super late noticing your tweet. Yep, he was probably there.
Which is worse, bad coffee or no coffee? After a week of no caffeine I thought no coffee. I'm currently having second thoughts.
Back home from 4 day weekend in Wisconsin. Would like to have stayed longer, but my liver threw in the towel.
Heading to Milwaukee. Brewer's, Cardinals and most importantly, tailgating.
What varietal goes best with a nice chili cheese frito?
Was approached at Brat Fest in Madison by fans of @TempletonRye. They noticed my shirt, told me they come to IA often to stock up!
Time for brat fest in downtown Madison.
Heading up to Madison to visit cheese and eat friends. Or whatever.
@sewzinski I'm not having one, but the the windows are open & their clucking is loud. These were some serious garage sale ladies.
There a bunch of ladies in from of my house bitching that my neighbor won't open her garage sale early for them.
I just drank a Schlitz. It wasn't as bad as I expected. It wasn't too bad at all. Or maybe I was just desperate for beer.
@mkeller10 Only halfway thru the podcast, but I have to say, chapter by chapter discussion w/ your kids on Star Wars equals awesome.
@lrafdal Your love of Bring It On leads me to believe you'll thoroughly enjoy Glee.
Today I considered killing a meaningless little golden man by slitting his throat. http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
@schippers It's cheesy goodness with a side of snark. Plus Journey! No Olive, though I've read she'll be a guest star!
Watched "Glee" on hulu. Am currently in a state of musical nerd heaven.
@frojive That and yelling at the damn kids to get off your lawn.
@lennykoggins and I are all growed up! Or rather, we are dressing like we are. How professional! http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com
Glad to hear the Swayz is okay. I have this shirt. I'm not kidding. http://www.bustedtees.com/crazyforswayze
I'm starting to think the only way to stop my eyes from itching is to stab them with toothpicks. #evenminorallergiesarewhack
Another great night of bad habit breaking with @DSMGolfLessons!
Sad news...Amigo, my garden duck has left the yard. No baby ducks, just bad eggs. My cat really wanted a pet duckling.
@sewzinski Looking for a transmitter that'll play my rad Ipod tunes through my car radio. Mine's broken.
Anyone have a recommendation for an Ipod FM transmitter? I needz a new one.
@jen0423 That Jillian workout is hardcore! It continues to kick my ass every time I do it.
Watching "Funny Face." Can't decide if I find Audrey Hepburn charming or annoying.
@daynegerous So you made a date with him, right? Sounds like a catch!
@schippers Oh, she's hot, just not the best actress. Sierra is my fave.
@schippers Nice. I like it despite ED's questionable acting skills.
@schippers Did Dollhouse get picked up? I'll be sad if I don't get my geeky Bartowski humor on the weekly.
Getting ready to head to Chicago for @lennykoggins 30th birthday bash!
Bought food and booze from @frojive at @fongspizza. He also beat me in the dance fight throw down.
@lrafdal are should be aren't. Damn you twitter for removing the delete option.
@lrafdal I still haven't seen Bring It On, so I guess it  hasn't been broughten. At least you are sticking up for Rockapella.
@Jensenrf So awesome. My cat needs one of those.
Zigga Zig Ah! I watched Spice World so you don't have to. http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
And then a tune by the New Main Street Singers shuffles on and all is right with the world.
It never fails, when I shuffle in Itunes some random WTF song comes up. Why do I have a song by Victoria Beckham?
@justcourtney I'm with you. The bachelorette party I'm planning is almost as involved as the wedding!
@BornLiar Sweet, I'm in. I'd like to be frozen in blue Flavor-Ice. Can you hook that up?
Can the final season of Lost start immediately, please? #LOST
Somebody ate the top off a muffin and left the stump in the kitchen. Didn't Rebecca DeMornay teach us that nobody wants the stump?
Turns out you can have both a mullet and rat tail. Saw just that today. Rare species.
@frojive Um, I'm busy now. Gonna need to reschedule that dance fight. That kids has mad skillz. I gots to practice.
@frojive It's on! Grabbing my parachute pants and legwarmers now. @bornliar should be invited. He has dance fight experience. Not kidding.
@frojive Do you want to meet somewhere for a dance fight soon? Perhaps a viewing party the next time it's on TBS?
RT @lennykoggins if the world had more dance fights, we'd all be wearing cooler pants. http://bit.ly/18DbvF
@ldonald Your day sounds like it's blurgy. That's dumb. But I bet your bangs look cute, so there's that.
Pretty much every banner ad on every site is for teeth whitening. I'm starting to feel self-conscious. Can they see me?
Jazz hands coming soon...http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
Need help w/ your golf game? Contact @DSMGolfLessons. Sarah's super rad. Who knew counting to 3 could be so helpful?
Looking forward to golf lessons tonight with @DSMGolfLessons / @eyeluvgolf
I dreamt of chain-smoking, spaniel sized cats and tap dancing last night. What did you dream about? http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
I'm glad I work at a place that has beer in the fridge. It is much needed these days.
My purse smells like Mexican restaurant.
@sewzinski Make a resolution to get more organized. Though I seem to be having trouble with just weekly resolutions lately.
@lennykoggins I will harass you across multiple social media venues about Bride Wars, but remain jealous of your Tombstone.
Can there be a good excuse to drink Mexican beer everyday? Pacifico...yum.
@sewzinski Just do it for a week. Way easier!
May is Preeclampsia Awareness Month. If know a pregnant lady, send her to Preeclampsia.org to learn more about the symptoms.
Best search term used to find my Wordpress blog so far today: Gay smurf.
@amywright Same here. I was up to my elbows in poo from a bag today.
http://twitpic.com/4i63x - I am a building and soon to be gardening master.
@daynegerous There's one at Otter Creek (haven't been there.) Also one b/t Ankeny & Johnston on NW 66th. That's where I usually go.
Read about what @lennykoggins and I are doing to spread the word about Preeclampsia awareness: http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
May is Preeclampsia Awareness Month. If know a pregnant lady, send her to Preeclampsia.org to learn more about the symptoms.
Drank beer while building a raised garden bed. Feeling tough and handy.
This is definitely going to be a venti day.
Can I use a jock jam too? That would really make this project original...and modern.
A sports metaphor...how refreshingly original. Or something.
Not making it to veggie talk w/ @amandazinger. Work is dumb.
@petersagal I'm confident "Wait, Wait," is the only place I'll hear an original pig flu joke. Otherwise I'm suffering flu fatigue.
@AmandaZinger I'm planning on attending! Unless today's project enters the chaos spiral. Which isn't out of the question.
@sewzinski Just wrote a testimonial for your Flickr because I think you're the cat's pajamas.
I'm totally over this pig flu stuff. How I long for the days when the news was filled with talk of pirates. Argh.
@AmandaZinger I may have to check that out. I've been thinking of starting a veggie garden this year and Wodsmith is seconds from my office.
@schippers No, yay! Also read the final 3 eps will air on Saturdays in late May. I'm planning to bake an apple guyere cheese pie w/ uppers.
I was just told I look 14. I think it's the pigtails. They make me feel kicky.
@HollyEgg Cool...I have a couple old cookbooks of my mom's from the 60s or 70s. BHG's Cooking on a Budget and Cooking For Two.
@BornLiar Did you forget your cardboard? That could have been the problem. Less support for headspins.
@lrafdal New season = fancier rain gear. My second choice would be the Wizard. Capt Keith's a hardass but I like him.
If I had to be on a crab boat, I'd totally pick the Northwestern. Love the Hansen Brothers.
@AvidTechnology No OMFI export for Symphony in an HD project? Ugh.
Fact: multiple people per day surf their way to the Fifty2 Resolutions blog by searching for smurfs doing unspeakable things to each other.
So, I guess I'm all about the Hamiltons, baby. Res 15 of 52, cash only. http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com
@nathantwright That is true. I loves me a British accent.
My head. She is hurty.
Okay, seriously. How do I get rid of that damn car warranty recorded phone message? It calls my cell every other day!
Wondering how my body will react to the re-introduction of caffeine. Was gonna try to stay clean, but just too damn tired. 8 days was plenty
@schippers For. Reals. Kung Fu Chuck is effing badass. And nerdy at the same time.
Reader's choice resolution week. We've raised over $100 for Preeclampsia! Vote for this week's res! http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com
Rock the vote! What should @lennykoggins and I do for our resolution this week? http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
Tons of cute stuff at @craftsaturday Well done Craft Saturday lady tweeps!
@frojive @BornLiar Well you guys already on best of your category. Clearly I need to step it up this year. Can't wait 'til July!
@lrafdal Also, I've been keeping up on your articles and you need to get your hands on some Tilly and the Wall. They're super rad.
@lrafdal @mkeller10 Actually, no booze is on the list. Probably over the summer. No hobo kills for a week is out of the question, obviously
@nathantwright Tell @bornliar that he's lame and greasy. And fat.
Margarita time. Finally!
Just put an order in for a six pack of Pacifico and some fresh limes to be sitting on the deck when I arrive home.
I'm pretty sure wedge flip flops are always a bad idea.
Why, yes. The Detroit Cobras is the perfect soundtrack for driving around with the windows down. Well played, Ipod!
Working on new spots for the Des Moines Partnership.
@chip1252 I'm just glad I'm not quitting heroin this week too!
The no caffeine headache is still around, but less hurtyt. Can't wait until Res.15 of 52 is done. http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com
I hate raccoons. They're definitely up to no good.
@SmartyPig http://m.smartypig.com
@amywright $20, for reals? I was gonna look into that, but 20 bucks seems a little steep for a 'movie.'
@mkeller10 Aspargus would be the obvious one...
Best junk mail subject line in quite a while: 'Will dance for gum.'
Three days without caffeine = 3 days of headaches. This is whack.
@OneIowa Just saw your spot during the Today show. Well done! Slightly classier than the 'storm is coming' folks. ;)
Didn't think I really needed caffeine all that much. Then I stopped drinking it...the headache, sweet baby jesus, the headache! 2 days now.
Just woke up to morning view of Applachian mountains. Showing my uncle how to twitter.
@lennykoggins saw this today. I'm pretty sure it belongs to someone who murders people. http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com
There is a six pack of Keystone Light in the  beverage cooler. Sam Adams is giving it the stink eye.
I love when people leave 2 tbsp. of coffee in the pot. If they don't drink finish it, they don't have to make more, I do.
Out of town this weekend. Devastated that I'll be missing Acrocats. Blurg.
Three days of work, then vacation with @lennykoggins, @esahrmann  and e1.
@esahrmann Yes, but his man boobs are about half the size they used to be and I love the striped pants.
Not really following his game, but Phil Mickelson is really stepping it up fashion-wise.
Heading out to DQ to get Blizzards for Easter dinner.
@notcarol I just started that book! Glad to here you liked it!
Cleaning out flower beds and came across a duck's next with four eggs. So that's strange.
@Tim_DigitalArts Is that a picture of you in 5th grade?
@BornLiar Not that I like telling people they're wrong (okay, I do) but your wrongness made me happy. Des + Penny = True Luv Forevah!!
I would totally watch an Odd Couple-ish sitcom starring Ben and Locke living together when Lost is done. Somebody make that happen. #Lost
@schippers The smokey effects were...not good. #Lost
@bornliar So glad you were wrong about that thing and you're sitting there in your wrongness being wrong. #Lost
@Cavan When does that robot find time to call you? That lady robot calls me constantly.
@daynegerous Harvey Sid is the cat's pajamas. I have an old VHS with each zodiac song in full length. I'm a P-p-p-picseas...
Damn you corrupt user settings slowing me down making things unnecessarily complicated. I glare in your general direction.
Had lunch at Mi Mexico with my gal pal @amandabrend, sadly, we had to skip margaritas this time.
@Tim_DigitalArts I'm dead from cute.
@Tim_DigitalArts Catching up on old tweets...did you get a new puppy? So cute!
Taxes, done. Blog ,done. Sporting Aquaman t-shirt, done.
@lennykoggins if my memory is correct, the keystone cops shirt may have been present the night you & @bornliar tried to out-klepto eachother
r/t @lennykoggins wanna see a keystone cop get trashed? http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com
Picking out my final Trash it or Rehash it outfit. Perhaps the "Marge" emblazoned warm-up jacket?
Just ate ramen noodles for lunch. Apparently I'm 19, poor and living in a dorm. Though I did use a stove instead of a hotpot.
Fantastic news! Well played, Iowa. #iagaymarriage
I'm pretty sure @lennykoggins outfit is tragic. You decide! http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
I'm suffering a severe lack of focus today.
@Tim_DigitalArts I'm still not clear on what a Jonas Brother is. Regardless, Kate never fails to amaze me with her bad, bad choices.
@grantkimm I know, right. Lucky for me, Gob signed away the animation rights. Best icon ever.
I don't like the connection ABC is making between Ben Folds and Bob Saget. Ew. Rockin' the Suburbs deserves better.
Cheese break!
I'm not the only one who still has a flannel in the back of the closet, right? http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com
@RobReevesStudio Somebody needs to make a grown up version of that. I would buy it in a second. Geektastic.
@angatdorotheas Please drop those yellow chairs off at my house at your earliest convenience. Love!
@Pegasus515 Flo's a close second on the list of people in commercials I like. But t-mobile girl w/ her glasses and striped shirt kills me.
@lennykoggins PJ totally used our 'I don't like to talk about mushy stuff so i'll use a valleygirl' voice to tell Bobby he's awesome. Cute!
@Pegasus515 Um, that confuses me.
I heart the "she thinks you're super delicous" girl from the t-mobile spot. I think she's me when I was nine.
Judge our questionable fashion sense. Res. #12, help us decide what to keep and what to trash. http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
Audio editing is making me sad.
12 hours of drinking. Time to call it a day. Once again, @FongsPizza  never disappoints. Nothing beats blue booze in monkey's head.
Just got a box 'o wine from Wine Woot, sent by my moms and dad. Aw, nice parents.
@pancheros 7
@volleycoach89 Should I imagine a really lame R&B beat to playing behind your tweet?
@schippers I freaking loved V when I was a kid. Probably my first venture into geek-itutde.
This is gonna be one of those great fridays. I can feel it.
@lennykoggins I have returned from the store with 50 bucks worth of cheese, booze & assorted junk food. Should be a good sisters weekend!
The silent pause coupled with the inquisitive head tilt was the loudest part of that conversation. Heh.
@leslieberg I'm pretty sure you can have them send you a check. Not 100% sure though.
@mrdallasjmoore My neighbor is a sales guy there!
@lennykoggins and I are not married/engaged to the same Eric. That would be creepy. http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com
Getting to know Arcade Fire's Funeral album again after watching the trailer for Where the Wild Things Are. It looks so dreamy.
@justcourtney Check with @Tim_DigitalArts. He knows those kind of things.
I could eat nothing but avocados from now on. Or at least for a couple days anyway.
@amywright Thanks for checking! Im sure there arent many places that still have VCRs. I have kids movies to donate if anyone knows of a one.
@antoinetteb Thanks, please ask when you have a chance. Good thinking on day care centers!
Have a bunch of Disney vhs movies. I'd rather donate than throw away. Anyone know a kids charity who could use them? And still uses a vcr?
@Tim_DigitalArts What can I say, I'm lame. At least I'm self aware.
Ian McShane is the cat's pajamas. A really mean, feral cat's pajamas.
There's a big rabbit nesting in our back yard. We've named her Tabitha.
The wind has started. It always sounds like my house is gonna blow over.
dmregister.com lied.. There was no jazz at Java Joes. Finishing Resolution #10 not looking good. http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
Spent yesterday afternoon drinking sangria outsideat Dos Rios. Gotta finish up resolutions #10 today. http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com
Heading to django. Time to brush up on my french. Ou est le chapeau? Pretty much all I remember after four years of high school french.
@BornLiar licked a baby's pacifier. Ew.
@BornLiar To creep you out?
I brought the bailey's, @bornliar is bringing the coffee. Oh, friday.
This just seems like a bad idea. Especially when Grey Gardens is already perfection. http://tinyurl.com/ccgedf
Aww, nice try Panthers. Too bad I have them going to the Sweet 16...not that I thought it'd actually happen. Wishful hoping. #ncaa
I'm pretty sure my shoulders are crooked.
The suburbs, they were rocked. http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
@DMSocialClub @alexson I'm far too excited about the Acrocats. Cats that do tricks are made of awesome.
@DMSocialClub Are you referring to the Acrocats? Are they coming to DM?  Cats who do acrobats. Who wouldn't want to see that?
@amywright Happy birthday, pretty lady!
@BornLiar Also perplexed by some of the reactions to  that song. And the mom singing it loudly w/ her jr. high aged son right next to me.
Ben Folds in four. Yay!
@alexson Mmmm. Cheese fountain...I won't be able to concentrate for the rest of the day.
@CatRocketship @Lloydb RE: Wild Things. Studios had big problems w/ Jonze's direction. Too scary, etc. Can't wait 'til it finally comes out.
I wish the Cheezits would stop asking me to eat them.
@Pegasus515 Geez, are you 12?
Things done to make a process easier rarely do that.
Dear timecode, please stop jumping all over the place. It makes me cranky.
I stiill remember the lyrics to "The Leaving Of Liverpool."
St Pats Day reminds me of Mr. Wolfe at Walcott Jr. High. He played irish tunes while we studied.
@Pegasus515 Darth Vader on a Pegasus! (in a bellowing voice) I'm totally sharing. Ga Ga it up, please.
Looking for live music this week. Preferably kinda cheap. Already going to see Mr Folds, suggestions? http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com
@mandymiller And you're a better person for it. I find that to be a good trait in a person!
@haleyelizabeth I'm tres jealous. You're both enjoying a book and staying warm. If only I could do the same!
@lennykoggins As I was eating a couple frozen thin mints, I was thinking to myself I'm glad girl scout cookie time only comes once a year.
@Pegasus515 Actually, I share her. She's to awesome to hide. Would be a good soundtrack for building 3d gas robots. Or drawing cats.
I don't care much for white wine...and yet, the bottle is empty.
La Querucia prosciutto w/ carmelized pears and walnuts. Best salad ever.
Lady GaGa makes cardio a little bit less sucky. ‚ô´ Boys, boys, boys! ‚ô´
@grantkimm The water fowl in Ankeny are abundant. Just wait 'til spring when you have your windows open. No sleeping in!
@timbrend Be brave, you'll be fine. (can text this week, twitter instead!)
Big Time is the bane of my existence.
You taste like burger, I don't like you any more.
@SophiaAhmad Sbrocco's my favorite downtown joint. Order the duck.

I'm thinking a bloody mary delivery service would be ideal right now.
Bachelorette party reservations made! Heading to Lake Geneva in June w/ @lennykoggins, @CassidyFletcher and the girls!
@soZealous I've never been on that site, but it looks like it could become a dangerous habit.
Logging food footage. Lunch now, please!
Dear Thelma Schoonmaker, can I be you when I grow up? Thanks, @CourtneeCee
Not texting is harder than I thought it'd be. http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com
Rendering and waiting, waiting and rendering.
@Pegasus515 You shoulda come in today. I had a say cheese for lunch!
@amandabrend I wouldn't say majorly. Just slightly. But not really at all.
@CassidyFletcher Rad, I'm in!
@Pegasus515 You can't be sick. I need animated ribbons and small text in various colors and fonts. Numerous versions of them, in fact.
Back to Banana Gob Bluth.
@BornLiar Not too bad. Though asiago is white and not dusty like doritos. Helped out a lot.
@bornliar Thanks for the nintendo resources, they came in handy! http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
Just had an amazing dinner at Boka in chicago. Pork belly and sweetbreads. and many gimlets...yum.
@lennykoggins I'm headed your way. Sisters weekend to commence in about five hours!
@FongsPizza The taco pizza and blue cocktail in the monkey head I had last night were awesome.
@angatdorotheas Love it! Little Edie is fabulous.
Taking today and tomorrow off.  Headed to @SMASH50309 & @FongsPizza later this afternoon and to Chicago for sisters weekend tomorrow!
@fawnita5 Happy Birthday!!
@Suzika My first time there. Loved it!
Delicious dinner at Tumea and Sons followed by games at All Play. Blog coming after Lost! http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
@schippers Dammit, that means no HD. Blurg!
@alexson Both excellent gift options!
@timbrend I love how @lennykoggins always shows up all stealth like. Though nothing will be the Pocket Crockett.
That sombraro totally snuck up on me.
@frojive Drat, I can't. Dinner plans. Great idea though, I'm going there for lunch. Next warm day?
@ldonald Like where??
@frojive Best bday present ever! I will buy all of the #dmtweeps drinks as a thank you. One at a time. Over many years.
Wow, so many birthday wishes already this morning, thanks #dmtweeps!
All of that information is incredibly helpful and would have been super handy three days ago. Today...it just annoys me.
Yeah, that really isn't gonna work for me...
@modcloth Your clue was far more clear than the one from @TweetContest. I was tres confused.
@TweetContest Jem And The Holograms Dress!
@nathantwright Thanks for the mid-afternoon Draper break. Oh, and good info too.
@amywright TV or dvd? I adore Little Edie.
Watching footage of @nathantwright
@BornLiar You were right...I *do* want to know more. Maybe.
Hey Des Moines tweeps, my pal/co-worker/ Todd, @Pegasus515, is a twitter newbie. He's a graphic artist. Follow him!
@BornLiar Whoa, did I miss a discussion about the Cambodian Midget Fighting League?
@amywright He's kinda sorta working. But not really. I'm totally working though.
Dear Junk Mail company, why would I be interested in a social networking site that NO ON KNOWS ABOUT?
Radiohead is a good soundtrack for today. Or any day, really.
@antoinetteb That has happened with my debit card twice in the last nine months. I finally learn a new pin number & it changes.
@fawnita5 Wednesday. You?
Finished Resolution 7 with a little Nancy Drew. http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
@EricaAdams I assumed the promos were pulling a fakeout with Robert. Maybe not.
@EricaAdams No kidding, she's pissed. And I'm assuming Tommy's off to the clink soon.
@fawnita5 It's my bday week too! I'll also celebrate w/ a gnome. This is Al, he was kidnapped by @timbrend and forced to do office work.
@fawnita5 Yay! I adore PJ and the boys.
@timbrend Not that I'm aware of. Amanda said you were sick.
@awesome_andrea Hotmail's working fine for me.
@lennykoggins Next weekend is gonna obliterate my eating healthier plan. Heaven cookies, cheese, brunch w/ bloodies, lambic, nintendo.
Making bacon for brunch. An attempt to cover up sadness of not having tickets to Baconfest.
I would like a cupcake now, please.
@BornLiar He will slap a cougar and put a boot in your neck. But would he provide free natty light?
@BornLiar True. Unless you're talking about Danny Trejo. Nobody would ever underestimate that dude. Badass!
@BornLiar @nathantwright  I totally shoulda kept that sketch when I stole it. Would look lovely framed in my office next to Baio and Ritter.
Mr. Banana Grabber may be getting a bit jealous of my love of the Nannerpus. http://tinyurl.com/bltu6r
@volleycoach89 I added almost the whole disc to my workout shuffle today. Love.
@dlayphoto Enjoy. I loved it. Totally thought Sean Penn deserved the Oscar, and usually I don't care for him.
This spot is dumb.
@BornLiar If I get home and my porch gnome is missing, I'm gonna be pissed.
@iowaradioguy Oh. My. God. Cheesefest. Someone please make this happen. That would make me the happiest lady in the land.
Looking for some kind of online invite site. Any suggestions? Other than the horrid Evite?
@daniAWESOME Oh, no problem. I woulda been bummed if I'd spent an hour of my time on it just to see Hosea win.
@daniAWESOME Whoa...I missed TC due to Lost. Please tell me you're kidding about Hosea.
Holy shit! Benjamin Linus is the awesomest tv bad guy ever. My mind, she is blown.
@esahrmann Ha! That's worse than "ethnically vague." Oh, and your avatar creeps me out.
@amywright I have no idea how that happened. Too busy cruising in the blue roadster with Nancy Drew solving mysteries??
@soZealous Ambitious! Chocolate and soda easy. Now, cheese, that's a different story. That would require some sort of rehab for me.
Started "Are You There God, It's Me Margaret" last night for Resolution #7. How did I not read this as a kid?
I could eat Thai Flavors' pad thai noodles with tofu every night.
@BornLiar same here after reading the comment you left. Laughed out loud. (I refuse to abbreviate that.)
@grantkimm "Brian uses his instincts and his hatchet" How did he get a hatchet on the plane? What kind of stuff does he hatchet up?
r/t @angatdorotheas Cleaning back room at Dorothea's Closet Vintage, 1733 Grand DSM...cheap buys, DM me to come by and hunt b4 it goes away!

The King of Kong reference on My Name is Earl made my week. Donkey Kong kill screen coming up!
Three day weekend! Headed out for a massage and facial soon.
@timbrend Nothing is better than Lost in HD. NOTHING!
@amywright I think I'm gonna do a day of RAGBRAI for a resolution. I'm scared. And my bike is a beach cruiser, which could be problematic.
Had greek lunch at Adonis in West Glen. Service was slow but food was delish.
@timbrend Which is cool...unless ISU Bball is on ch 5 and therefore in SD, followed by Lost in SD, thus pissing me off.
I couldn't spoil Lost if I wanted to. I have no idea what's going on.
@fawnita5 Enjoy the dvds! Do listen to any commentary by Matt Weiner. Incredibly insightful.
@schippers Gave up on Mad Men? I adore it! Am also enjoying Trust Me. And Lost continues to blow my mind. I heart TV.
r/t @timbrend Does anyone know of a web person who needs a full time job? Yes, a full time job! Please email tim.brend@digitalartsusa.com.
@soZealous The promise of creepy confusion (and Sayid) in the evening makes Wednesdays so much better.
Awaiting a room full of clients. Candy bowl stocked.
I do not respond to the bellow. It's not really the best inter-office communication method.
I smell like Mexican restaurant. Ew.
Overly strong coffee. Burrowing a hole in my brain.
Looks like it's a Bowie morning. That doesn't happen often.
@Kathy_L Love the site!
@johnerobinson Hey, I edited that commercial! We've still got that sparkly frog hanging around the office somewhere.
@nathantwright Watching video of you sounds rad. But mostly we'll drink beer and devise plans rule the cat kingdom in the backyard, right?
I take Relpax for my migraines. It helps. I'm not non-functional for 24hrs like I used to be, but I still feel a little off.
@amywright I also have a sinus infection which is super fun. Heading to the chiro to have him look at my neck and back.
@abbieshipton Thanks for mentioning those things. I never woulda thought of that. Hopefully this will be my last one for a while. .
Another migraine last night. That's two in three weeks. I usually only have that many in a year. Boo.
@vitusdancers Thinking I heard Leslie Hall was also performing Sat nite at People's, but can't find anything online. Did I just make it up?
"Pork plasma. Not for human consumption." Grossest thing I've ever read on the side of a semi.
@leslieberg Blurg! I have DirectTV. I've become such an HD snob.
@ABC5_WOI  Where's my pretty HD? Lost in SD just isn't the same.
The cats that hang out in the backyard at work have been named Bart, She-Ra and Clownbaby.
Heading out to lunch. Gonna hand out boxes of conversation hearts.
Back after a second round of this stupid cold. I'm pretty sure I lack an immune system.
@clairecelsi We work with them here at Applied Art. I don't know anyone there personally, but @volleycoach89  does.
@grantkimm Dude, how did I not see that coming? Feels good to be Rick Roll'd again.
Haven't been on Twitter in almost a week. What'd I miss?
I adore Found Things in the East Village. Wondering if I can move in.
Listening to uncharacteristically upbeat music. Hoping it'll lift my mood.
Feeling cloudy.
My nose is hurty. I'm tired. Want to go home. Being sick is wack.
Reader's choice week over at 52 Resolutions! Only 1 submission so far & I don't want to do it. Help! http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
Back to work. Not feeling 100%, but better than -74% which is where I was.
Traded yesterday's migraine for a cold. Best weekend ever!
I suppose if I have to be home sick today, I'm happy to have a full day of Stacey & Clinton keeping me company. Thanks, TLC.
@timbrend Are you eating school lunch or something?
I made art with 1st graders today! http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com
@frojive Ohmygodawesome idea!! Will have to redo the Let's Be Kids rez in spring. I'll throw a tag party. TV, cartoon, freeze, tunnel, etc.
Heading out to work on Resolution #2: Do something you haven't done since you were a kid. Should be some good pics for this one.

Sorenson Squeeze, you are the devil's software. I hate you.
I've never seen a High School Musical thingy, but if it's anything like the version Southpark just did, I gonna have to look into it.
@awesome_andrea And most importantly, Natty Light!
@awesome_andrea So then you hit on him, right?
If anyone has any spare creativity they aren't using I'd like to borrow some. Mine is taking a nap.
@Lloydb I don't know. I should check on that. Stupid roller skating rinks effing up my plans.
@frojive @BornLiar Oh yeah...I said I'd share those, didn't I. The edited set is headed to your email soon.
@BornLiar I don't get it. Do we have a smoking joke? Was I drunk and just don't remember it? Are there incriminating photos?
All the roller skating rinks are reserved for private skating on Thursdays. Wack! I'm thinking ice skating instead. tinyurl.com/9vjqx3
@BornLiar Tell Keith I said hi!
As a huge fan of The West Wing, this makes me happy. http://tinyurl.com/7eoxte

Okay, the Obama girls are adorable.
What's up with the crazy purple scarves the Bush Srs. are wearing?

Set Itunes to build a play list based on Fleet Foxes' 'White Winter Hymnal.' The musics sound all warm and strummy.
Dear Itunes Genius Bar - have I told you lately that love you? It's true.
Just completed resolution #1 of my Fifty2 Resolutions. Resolution #2 coming tomorrow. It's a fun one! http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com

@timbrend Pinstripe suits maybe?

Decided not to leave my gym bag in the car today. Cold clothes and stiff shoes made working out even less fun than usual last night.
@frojive One of my all time faves. I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland.
@antoinetteb Clearly we are living in the future.
Hey, it's not Thursday. Who knew?
My sister @lennykoggins made a new friend! http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
@daniAWESOME You don't think it's natural to be able to see every one of a person's ribs both front and back? You really are jus' jealous :)
My bangs are unruly.
So glad my neighbor views his snowblower as his super fun high powered toy. And that he accepts beer for payment.
Rewatched "American Movie." If you haven't seen it, do so.
I'm pretty sure the only reason I'm starving is because I'm trying to eat healthy and there are Cheez-its on the premises.
I would really like a cupcake about now.
@volleycoach89 NPH is the cat's pajamas. I adore him.
@lennykoggins Davenport or vodka?
The first of 52 Resolutions is up! How bad do I wish my first tweetup was this week instead of last http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
Feeling cloudy.
The Goonies is on! Data is setting bootie traps, Chunk & Sloth are eating Baby Ruths. Love it.
Yay for neighbors who love their snowblowers!
@eyeluvgolf Your Ragbrai suggestion is both fantastic and terrifying!
Trying to redeem canceled airline ticket. Hate having to deal with this stuff over the phone. Been transferred a million times. Help!
@frojive I think our moms may be long lost twins.
@lennykoggins You're not tweeting wrong. Just teaching you the ropes. But the unicorn/beer confusion last night was amusing.
@lennykoggins How many different communication tools can we use at once? 2 email streams, twitter, blog. Let's IM and text too.
@frojive Who's that lady? On first glance I thought it was my mom. For reals.
@nathantwright Will have to tell you about @lennykoggins attempts to twitter you back. She doesn't really get the twitter thing yet.
@nathantwright Ha! Thanks for letting me hover. I was kinda doing a 'Slew,' wasn't I.
@DSMGolfLessons Hi! You followed me before Stephanie did...you are much cooler than she is.
Fun meeting tweeps at my first #dmtweetup. And no hazing! Rad.
@lennykoggins Aww, your tweets are cute...nobody bought your unricorn a beer. This shiz isn't facebook!
Got a tasty muffin from @sweetbinney to have for lunch w/ my not so tasty but low fat desk soup.
@daniAWESOME Um, yeah. Did I say I'd be going to my first #dmtweetup tonight? Looks like I may need to do...something else instead. :)
@clairecelsi That'll be 1 of mine, but I'll be doing 51 more with my sister! Check it out http://fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
@nathantwright That's the plan so far. As long as there isn't any sort of scary first time #dmtweetup attendee hazing or anything.
Think I might make it to my first #dmtweetup tonight!
New delicious coffee at the office. @CourtneeCee is a much happier and more alert editor.
Can that awful wedding wars movie please come out so I don't have to see the commercials anymore!
Pink Sweet Tarts are the best thing ever.
@dmJuice Yay! I adore that show. Must see Michael Feldman.
New project/blog w/ my sis. Why fail at 1 big resolution for the year when u can tackle 52 small ones? fifty2resolutions.wordpress.com/
Somebody got caught by the traffic cam at 86th and Hickman. That person is me. Kinda nice that husband's name is on the ticket though.
@dlayphoto Yeah. Her comeback strategy seems to be talk louder while saying nothing at all.
Ann Coulter is a ridiculous person. Can she go away now?
My sister and I are planning a new project/blog we're really excited about. More info soon!
@EricaAdams Not weird. I went to the movies by myself today. I thoroughly enjoy alone time.
@soZealous The Snuggie commercial would definitely be cooler if there were 19 people dancing and a little bit 'o tambourine.
The frustration of the lady whose blanket falls off when she tries to change the channel continues to amuse me. I totally need a snuggie.
@amywright I do drink chocolate milk on occasion. It makes kids like me big and strong and tastes way better than the plain stuff.
@amywright Bone density and good teeth are my friends...but the taste of milk is ew.
The movie 'Milk' was fantastic. The beverage milk continues to be gross.
@aroger I vote no. Unless the style of the whole video is 80s-ish.
Just watched a video with multiple un-ironic clockwipes. Ew.
Back to work after a nice long break.
You can't gin rotten cotton. Who knew?
Heading out for my neighborhood's progressive appetizer and cocktail party!
Crazy sighting of the day...man playing harmonica while grocery shopping at Ankeny Hy-vee
Linger, linger, linger.
@sfedd If you take it from me I will burn the building down.
I was kinda bummed when the Diff'rent Strokes dvds were stolen from me. But the Red Swingline totally made up for it. Gift-a-palooza!
http://twitpic.com/u8ov - Great gift exchange present or greatest gift exchange present?
Gift exchange complete. Now drinking beer. My job is rad.
@SmartyPig facebook!
Granite City puts waaay to much dressing on their salads. Also, I smell like a clove of garlic.
@nathantwright Don't worry, I'd never refer to you as 'sir.'
I shake my fist in your general direction, sir.
The "He went to Jared!!" commercials can go away now.
@lennykoggins I ate a fancy grilled cheese today. It made me think of you.
@dmJuice I was the drum major in the marching band. Queen nerd, right here!
Feeling headachey...
If you haven't had the 'Say Cheese' sandwich from Tastebuds Cafe in Urbadale, you should. It will change your life. I promise.
Why do I have to get so busy every year this time? I have negative amounts holiday cheer.
@BornLiar For reals. And it's nice that the prettiest song in the collection isn't about a serial killer.
Busy, busy, busy...
Speaking of Cyclone basketball, check out the super sweet new spots! http://blog.appliedart.com/
Lobster bisque at Waterfront for lunch. Made of awesome. And a lot of butter.
@nathantwright I'm intrigued....
@BornLiar Did you buy it from Sam Rockwell? That may be your problem.
If you've seen my motivation, let it know I'm looking for it. Sorta. But not really.
Feeling the effects of skipping morning coffee. The new office coffee tastes like sadness. Now I'm tired and sad.
@Suzika I find myself saying that almost every day...
Let the thermostat war begin!
@annetteschulte Good to know! I can't wait to start spilling soda on the carpet!
@nathantwright Eric is in love with the ShamWow! informercial.  I'm actually considering buying it for him for Christmas.
The new office coffee is...not good.
Getting ready to hit the road to Chicago. Let sisters weekend begin!
Back from delicious mexican lunch and original margarita (singular!) at Mi Mexico!
Listening to Martha Wainwright's latest release and am in love with it.
Logging footage is always more enjoyable when the subject speaks with a British accent.
Today is Friday for me. Hurrah!
Chuck Taylors are not ideal footwear for snowy days.
Was awakened extra early today by my cat. Who apparently taught herself how to jump up and turn the light on. Twice. Seriously.
Watching at cat v. deer stare-down out my window. Don't know who to root for.
Mr. Banana Grabber's all gussied up for the holidays.
So happy this is another short week for me!
http://twitpic.com/o6ia - @Templeton Rye bus making our morning sunnier!
@TempletonRye You are my Wednesday morning hero! No better way to start a holiday weekend than whiskey and bloody marys. At work.
The  @TempletonRye bus will be at my office in about and hour. Nice!
DirectTV is broadcasting local networks in HD. Pretty!
@nathantwright Hells yeah.
@lindsayrees Why would you ever steer clear of VM's shoe section? Does not compute! (though after this purchase, I probably should.)
@liabo I've never been called a trollop before. I think I'm flattered!
@lindsayrees Von Maur, my second home. The Sam Button style in gray. So pretty!
I accidentally bought a pair of Frye boots over lunch. On sale, but still spendy. I blame the girl tweeps talking about shoes earlier.
I haven't tweeted in days. And yet I still have nothing to say.
Beware of stabby hobos.
@amywright Delilah? For reals? She is my nemesis. As is Fergie. And now maybe @nathantwright
@awesome_andrea And if I had my tap shoes, I'd join you in a single standard time step.
Thanksgiving feast at the office today. My edit suite is way too close to the kitchen. Must start snacking now.
Editing ISU Men's Bball to some funky 70s beats.
My office door is closed. That means I'm busy and I don't want you to come barging in. Thanks.
I'm having a focus problem.
@johnpemble I adore the puppycam. It's been a crazy work week and it's nice to check in on the puppies every now and then.
Natalie is wisecracking, Tootie is sassy! Listen to the Moth Podcast, it will make your day better.
@schippers ABC sucks. PD gets 1 million new viewers after the Obama-mercial and then they bench it for 3 wks. Smart. I need my own network.
Today is definitely gonna be a venti day.
@schippers That's something I guess...but I prefer to see the Pie Hole gang moving.
'The Wordy Shipmates' is different from Sarah Vowell's other books, but I'm enjoying it just the same.
I'm going to need either a brownie or a cupcake after work today. Possibly both.
Today is more than welcome to be over now.
@Juice_Joe Congrats!
@schippers Haven't heard from him, but did read that producers were told to treat ep 13 as series finale. Not sure if it's true. Hope not!
Would somebody like to take the computer trolls off my hands?
@DannyEngesser Nope, it's not ours, just using it. Sure is fun playing with super slow basketball shots!
@iowaradioguy 16 Jens, 10 Jennies, and that other one...you know, her.
@sfedd Honeycrisp Apples are the best thing in the entire world. Ever. They make me happy.
Getting started on ISU Men's bball commercial using footage shot on Red Camera. Pretty.
It's freezing in here.
@johnerobinson Good to know. I'll keep it in mind for next time!
Fact: The spicy scallop roll at Myiabi 9 is the best sushi roll in DeMo.
@daniAWESOME Turk and his airband peforming "More Than A Feeling" is another one that makes any day 10x better.
The puppy cam is killing me with cute!  http://tinyurl.com/5ujhmx
@abbieshipton Finally...an upside to migraines! 'Bout time.
Disappointing coffee. Bad way to start the day. On to the Cheez-its!
Thunder just made my house shake. cool.
@CourtneeCee is pleased.
@Kathy_L  Well done, and nice write up. Have fun!
Missing Tim Russert today.
@BornLiar It most certainly does. Beer and sunshine in November also help.
A woman in my precinct turned her ballot to side two and it was already filled out.
50 minute wait to vote in Skankeny. Barely made it to dentist appt. Voted Obama and no cavities...top-notch morning!
@BornLiar Heather and I will be there too!
@BornLiar Heather and I are up for Monday lunch 2: Electric Bugaloo.
West Wing marathon on Bravo = @CourtneeCee getting absolutely nothing done on a Saturday.
@SmartyPig Down under...Australia!
Tour of about 16 high school students just went through. I'm awkward in large group situations. Never know what to say to them.
Okay, there are no clients in the edit suite for the first time in three weeks. I feel like I'm missing an arm or something.
And now my three week run of having at least four clients in the edit suite at all times has come to an end. I think I'll be bored now.
Can I interest anyone in a clockwipe?
My head is hurty.
So many rounds of revisions...this project is getting confusing.
Girls night!  Soup, Persepolis, cheese and cupcakes.
@HighSociety Also, closer to downtown, the Pepper Canister is swell.
@HighSociety Babareba is good, also a place called Tilli's just down the block from it. Great martinis. More Lincoln Park than Wrigleyville.
Waiting and wendering, wendering and waiting....
Big client dinner tonight at Django! Won't mind working tonight!
And now my evening client is here. Please let there be few changes! To much work the last three weeks.
@hillabean Yes, I think a serenade would do quite nicely!
@awesome_andrea Yum. I love both dearly. Nothing  better than a fresh bag o' Circus Peanuts. Mallowcream pumpkins also taste similar.
@schippers I'm part of an editors grp w/ PDs editor. He said the creator and network are at odds over direction of show. Plus ratings. Boo.
Today I am wearing the shirt that @hillabean is wearing in her profile pic. Whisper rock, shhhhhh!
@Kathy_L Just keep wearing your flip flops and everything should be okay!
I woke up in the middle of the night, looked out of the window, and there was a dusting of snow on my driveway.
@amywright Have we discussed our Subway connection before? I worked there, but never underwent official Sandwich Artist training.
Ch-ch-ch-changes! These import and render times are killin' me, Smalls!
Thai Flavors in Skankeny delivers! So awesome..and also very very bad for me.
@juice_brianne Hey, me too. Though for me it's an everyday thing.
@Kathy_L I am available for any volunteer work that may come up! It's important to give back, of course.
@Lloydb I could eat the Cool Basi's Pad Thai noodles everyday. I like tofu, but the other meats are good too. The green curry is also tasty.
Has anyone seen my tambourine?  http://tinyurl.com/23bpvr
It's not to early for a #halloweenvatar is it?
Logging HD footage, listening to Death Cab, drinking coffee. Not a bad Monday morning.
@BrettTrout @Kathy_L Working w/ an out of town agency right now & it's going very well. No "I'm from the big city" condescension this time.
@Kathy_L Well done on the Nikon thing!
@DVDQuotes Reservoir Dogs.
At work. Blurg.
Heading home from the office. Work-free Saturday ahead and than back at it on Sunday.
@sfedd That would be rad!
@sfedd @hillbean The Fug Girls are brilliant. I want to be best friends with them.
Working late on a Friday is dumb.
Wow. Today has been quite a day so far. Insanely busy, in a good way. Number of people in my office right now, just me. Down 9 from earlier.
@hillabean I think I just got Kriss Kross roll'd!
There is a ridiculous amount of people in my office again.
@hillabean Glad I didn't wear mine today. That would have been *so* embarrassing.
@BornLiar I know, right? Next up, Tina Fey & Don Draper. The only problem I see is that one of them if fictional.
Had fun hanging out with @hillabean and @dacri at the Joshua Radin show last night!
@hillabean Seriously. He loved us.
@hillabean I'll probably be there around 8 as well.
@hillabean What time are you heading that way?
Office dinner tonight. Cheese and crackers.
Hit a record number of people in my office today...14! Too many cooks.
@hillabean I think I'll probably be there!
Lots of ladies with drawn on eyebrows around here today.
@dacri If loving guys in eyeliner is weird, I don't want to be...not weird.
Audio tracks have arrived. Crazy busy for the rest of the day!
@Kathy_L No, but I would still listen to it if it was. Tasty!
If you aren't listening to The Bugle Podcast, you should be. John Oliver, British accents....what's not to love?
Progress bars lie.
Dear Starbucks Pumpkin Cream Cheese Muffin, you have changed my life. I love you.
@JulesJoyce Thrilled to hear the new Shorty's is rad. I was so sad when original recipe Shorty's closed.
@hillabean Spot on description...kids near the merch table? Good seeing you last night!
Having trouble keeping up!
@schippers Good luck!
I'm also bitter I never had pencils or baretttes with my name on them as a kid.
People always spell my name wrong. I blame my mom for spelling it wrong in the first place.
@thenadas Yep, I'll be there! So glad they've finally come to DeMo!
@nathantwright Come say hi to me, I'm heading out soon!
@thenadas The show starts at 7 and I'm pretty sure there is an opener.
I just got a text confirmation for my next dentist appointment. I'm totally living in the future!
@Capital1063 Blurg! Why did a roomful of clients have to walk in right when the Old 97's ticket giveaway was announced!
Anybody go to the Ben Kweller show last night? Really wanted to, but was out of town.
@amywright Awesome, thanks for the info. Now to figure out when I can get there. I'm usually on top of things like this. So bizay.
@daniAWESOME Good to know. Having trouble finding time to get down there anyway. One less thing to stress about. Thanks!
@amywright I haven't bought them yet.
Can you pick up tickets for shows at People's ahead of time? Just realized I forgot buy tix for Old 97s. Don't wanna wait in line tomorrow.
Pretty sure I saw @awesome_andrea strolling around the Civic Center in her fab Reefer costume.
David Sedaris called my friend and I 'foxes.' Which is amusing. And awesome.
That perfume is not covering up the smell of cigarette smoke. In fact, it makes it worse!
@awesome_andrea Do it! Before his show...would love to hear him reference that!
@juice_brianne You will love Jenny Lewis. I promise.
Today is my Friday. Off to Madison, land of beer and cheese, tomorrow. Hurrah!
David Sedaris tonight!  Cannot wait. I lurve him.
Oh Emerson, I hope you find your lil' Gumshoe.
@schippers I heart Wednesdays. And Rachael Harris is on this week. Love her.
Piano player at Von Maur was playing the Mary Tyler Moore theme. If I'd been wearing a hat I would have thrown it in the air.
If everything continues to go smoothly, I won't have to work tonight! That would be ideal.
This week was supposed to by super crazy...and it hasn't been. Everything has been running smoothly and ahead of schedule. I am awesome.
Nature is happening outside the window. Deer & squirrels & cats, oh my!
Good lighting goes a long way.
Maybe I was just tired last night, but I think I'm kinda over Heroes. Unless Sylar & Noah get their own lifestyle show in HGTV.
Super busy M-Th, then off to Madison on Friday for friends and cheese!
Getting the day started with coffee and Bailey's. Headed up to tailgate soon!
@amywright Great Plains for dinner but no other solid plans. You? I'll DM you my number. Drop me a text later.
@cinemawerks You're going to listen to Charlie Kauffman talk at you?  Jealous.
@amywright Like the town Ames? The party sock girls are headed to Ames tonight.
@amywright @nathantwright Party socks exist. You used to be able to buy them at target. You put 'em on, parties happen. I'm a little nerdy.
@schippers I loved it. So pretty & colorful & mysterious. Perfect amount of whimsey countered w/ Emerson and his biting sarcasm. Love. You?
Not done w/ today's project yet, but things are still smooth. Coasting through friday afternoon to a sister's weekend! Party socks activate.
Okay, today is going to go smoothly. Project will wrap up by mid-afternoon. I will be home by the time sister arrives from Chicago. I hope.
Anderson Cooper is purty.
I don't relate to soccer moms & Joe Six Pack sitting around their kitchen table on main street. Maverick!
Was maverick the go-to word when she when she couldn't figure out what to say?
@SmartyPig Overstock.com 6%!!
Counting down  to the Pushing Daisies season premiere. I'm not usually a fan of whimsy, but I adore everyone at the Pie Hole.
@Kathy_L There doesn't seem to be a huge difference between fake Sarah Palin and the real one.
@Juice_Sophia Tastebuds' beer cheese soup is the most amazing soup ever. I believe there are approximately nine pounds of butter in it.
Why am I snacking so much today?
Honeycrisp apples are in season again. Most delicious apple ever.
@DMRegister is up on the Hot Political Topics bar!
The facts are these...I cannot wait for the return of Ned the swoony pie maker and Emerson the sarcastic knitting PI tonight.
Hey, I'm being followed by my favorite fictional first couple, @Bartlet & @AbbeyBartlet. I miss the West Wing.
@amywright I'm so glad you found a way to twitter that @BornLiar is, in fact, Des Moines' Little Gem.
I have found when someone says, "have fun with it!" they don't really mean it.
@liabo @amywright I'd like some of the bananas too. They taste like circus peanuts. Also delicious in a very artificial way.
A co-worker brought me a cinnamon dolce latte this morning. He is officially my favorite person of the day.
@karebear006 I love it too! "Jack Killed Mom" blows my mind into a million pieces.
@amywright Very true. He's a pretty cool boy. And he will buy me drinks, so I guess I win.
Going to my husband's 15 Yr high school reunion this weekend. Not really excited about that.
Listening to Tegan and Sara.
Why do I have stuff going on out of town during Oktoberfest every year?
@juice_brianne Wow that's something I hadn't thought of in a while. I had the pink ribbon twirly thing.
@iowaradioguy I know the guy who does photography for Arby's. You don't want to know how their &quot;meat&quot; is made. Ew.
Just because I don't have an client in the edit suite, doesn't mean I'm not busy! Cannot get anything done w/ all these interruptions!
There is a family of a mama cat and 4 kittens living in our backyard at work. SO CUTE! I want them all. I could watch them play all day.
It's only Thursday? Really??
@amywright Sounds like you've got yourself a little salad. Save that for an afternoon snack!
I don't like shouting. If I see u across a bar or parking lot, I won't shout hello. It makes me uncomfortable. I'm socially awkward.
Tastebuds' beer cheese soup is pure buttery perfection.
If only Obama and my beloved President Bartlett could meet up for a conversation. It would be made of awesome. http://tinyurl.com/4dz2kg
Why does logging footage make me so sleepy? Why is there a big spot of something on the lens?
Anniversary dinner tonight! Thinking Lucca or Django...
Heroes was good last night, but I was sad to see that Mohinder and the girl oil twin are still around.
Jenny Lewis was waiting in my Itunes for me this morning. So thoughtful of her.
Listening to Jenny Lewis & The Watson Twins in anticipation of the new Jenny album coming out tomorrow!
Heading out to mow. My backyard is too big.
Today can go ahead and start moving a little faster now.
Bought some Lindeman's Peach Lambic to take to a friend's for dinner tonight. Thinking it may be a good idea to go ahead and drink it now.
The Itunes Genius function is ensuring that I have a nice mellow Friday to end a crazy/crappy week.
I haven't been this relieved to see Friday in a long time.
@soZealous Resigning to the tune of "That Thing You Do?"
can this week be over now...please??
@schippers No, not really. Surprised it's still open. It was empty.
Also at Merle Hay Mall today, Walden Books going out of business. Everything 40% off. Bought 5 books for $36!
Younkers at Merle Hay has a Christmas display up. That's wack.
@hillabean Eeee! I adore Joshua Radin!
@amywright Dolly's coming? OMG, she's made of awesome.
@Kathy_L So sorry, Kathy. Take care.
How is today not over yet?
@garlicgirl Fun fact. I love frozen pizza. Love it. To a ridiculous degree. Mom wouldn't buy it when I was a kid. So now, I'm all about it.
@Kathy_L Sending good thoughts your way...
New Lotto spots done.
Dreamt about adding slates to spots last night. They kept changing & I couldn't keep up. Work anxiety, perhaps?
Finally got almost everything done. Going home now. In early tomorrow.
Fastest day ever. So much to do yet.
I'm pretty sure heaven tastes a little like a Jimmy John's #5.
#onmydesk Autographed pics of John Ritter & Scott Baio, small gnome diorama, various metal sculptures welded by my dad, book about bad hair.
@schippers Me too. Hoping they get rid of those clunky 3d location graphics though. Ew. Otherwise, quite intrigued by the premiere.
So much to do this morning. Thank goodness coffee is my BFF.
Another day w/ clients in the whole time.
Day drinking is the best drinking.
@dlayphoto I know, right? As if going to a baby shower isn't bad enough on its own.
I will be at a baby shower during the 1st half of the Iowa/ISU game. Not pleased.
No twittering for me today. Finally leaving the office.
@Kathy_L Hope everything turns out okay. Take care.
Clients in all day today! Just showed some Lottery folks what their twitter page looks like.
Hey Mic Boom...you're in the shot.
Tried a new scented body butter today. Do not like the scent. Overpowring & perfumey. Will smell like this all day. Blurg.
Greek turkey burgers for dinner. Tasty.
@Wirez LORENZO LAMAS!! It really doesn't get any better than that 80's wise.
@KevinMcCarthy I remain loyal only to the 'Crest and the Channing and St. James families.
@KevinMcCarthy Falcon Crest is so much better! It has Angela Channing & the winery & Lorenzo Lamas!! Does that count for nothing.
Buying baby gifts is stressful for non-baby people. Babies need a lot of stuff & I don't know what any of it is. I'm hiring out next time.
Got a scrip for meds and a pumpkin spice latte. Things are looking better already.
Heading to the doctor. Need to get rid of this post-nasal/dry cough bs that's been effing with me for a month.
How did I not know Fringe was starting last night? I'm off my game.
@BornLiar @Kathy_L I think the punch in the neck would also help you find your sense of urgency. If that's something you're concerned about.
Suddenly super tired. Like fall asleep in my chair tired. That's bad when clients are in for today's edit.
Getting a slow start on today. Blurg.
@Kathy_L Hope everything's okay with your dad. Sending good vibes your way.
@BornLiar Also, I will be on Heroes and vow to destroy the Oil Twins while engaging in badassery with HRG.
@BornLiar I fear my superhuman summer is going to lead to a disastrous fall.
@BornLiar Sounds like you need some of my mojo. Sadly, I'm not sharing.
Why am I not getting anything done today...I feel like I'm working.
I love rainy days.
Mixing more tailgate shots. Raspberry vodka plus pineapple juice. Delicious!
@frojive Will do. Hoping my styrofoam cooler doesn't get karate chopped.
Looking forward to gorgeous tailgating weather today!
@CatRocketship Beware of the eye fultters, for me that usually means a migraine is coming.
I am far less likely to patronize your business when you make employees stand outside wearing sandwich boards.
Just finished mixing two large vats of shots for tomorrows game! Cardinal Sin and Gone with a Flash. See you at the tailgate!
Someone's grouchy today. It's me. I'm grouchy.
@BornLiar Hm. Sounds dodgy. He did have a wonky eye, so it must have been a doppleganger.
@BornLiar Minnesota is just what I heard. From a guy. Yesterday. He looked like you.
@BornLiar I heard the same thing about Minnesota.
@garlicgirl Smartbargains.com also has great deals on high thread count sheets. Are you preparing for a Diddy visit?
I have a feeling today is going to annoying.
@nathantwright Watched last night's episode over lunch today. I want to marry the Daily Show.
Iron & Wine, perfect soundtrack for a rainy morning.
Can Brian Williams please be on the Daily Show everyday...
My interwebs are slow.
Shopping for a new coffee maker. Probably should discount one w/ good reviews because it doesn't look cool. But that's how I roll.
Had thai food at Zuzap for lunch. Not bad, but I'll stick with Cool Basil and Thai Flavors for my Pad Thai noodles.
Just had a nice lunch meeting with my friend Hannah. She may be a DeMo tweep soon!
I just joined a fantasy fball league. Huh. I love college fball, but loathe NFL. I do like talking smack about things I know nothing about.
Got my new audio software today!  A/V geek-out!
@awesome_andrea Chiming in on the eye prob. Def sounds like allergic reaction. Same happens to my lips when I use Burts Bees chapstick.
@awesome_andrea #PronounciationNazi In jr. high our drama teacher did a rap over the PA about Libarry v. Library. Yes. A rap.
Rock Me Sexy Jesus rocks my world.
No Reservations marathon!  I heart Tony Bourdain.
Did I really think I could start watching Dexter S1 w/ only 4 eps left and not stay up til it was done? Stupid girl. Am tired now.
@haleyelizabeth Don't forget about the Rooster! They're the most talented family on the planet!
Bought tomatoes, peppers and tasty sun-dried tomato goat cheese at Farmer's Market! Is there anything better than cheese?
@frojive @bornliar will have to review photos and then decide. The fact that most of them were taken at the end of the evening worries me.
@frojive Even sober, I'd still pay money to see goth strippers.
Fancy effects on HD footage render slow...
@awesome_andrea unfortunately, yes.
Kids Incorporated! With a pre-meth Fergie...who is my nemesis, by the way.
@awesome_andrea Team A Sense of Urgency boozed last night. @frojive had the foresight to take this morning off. I didn't, but should have.
Blurg. Sleepy.
@BornLiar @CourtneeCee is as well. Finally. This afternoon is taking forever.
I will listen to Sondre Lerche this afternoon. It will be lovely.
I'm pretty sure this coffee is eating my stomach.
@amywright Oh no, that worries me. Don't hate, I totally had your back at the Mews that one time! This hi-5 thing will blow over. Trust
@amywright I refuse to recognize high fives, fist bumps, etc. Ask @nathantwright for details.
@amywright You basically have to keep the mic outta the shot while being being both mocked and snubbed. No high fives either, sister.
@BornLiar  @frojive I canceled an appointment and pushed a client back for Thurs. Guessing the score will be booze - 1, @CourtneeCee - 0.
@garlicgirl My guess is it has something to do with his CAJUN STYLE!	http://tinyurl.com/5pa76p
Just downloaded new Old 97's. Can't wait for the show in October!
@schippers Yeah, Sal & Betty have been twittering about lawyers and such. Paul has respectfully signed off for good. Boo!
I want to be Michelle Obama when I grow up.
@Evil0verlord I coulda used your skills in high school. Not only was I a band geek, I was the drum major in marching band. Queen geek!
Shuffling on Itunes and now must ask, "Never Been to Me" by Charlene...great song or greatest song?
I was tricked into coloring my grandmother's hair this weekend. It was...interesting.  Duped by my own dad.
@BornLiar Now who's envious...
@BornLiar 'Tis true, I have no shame when it comes to Draper. Or Joan for that matter.
@Kathy_L Aces, dude.  I'm in!
@Kathy_L @BornLiar and I are on a two person mission to bring wack back.
@BornLiar Yes it is. It is totally wack. For reals.
@BornLiar You missed out! We had dinner sized portions of sushi and beverages.
@BornLiar Correct, but the two are somewhat related and she beat me to the apostrophe's.
@KevinMcCarthy #grammarpeeves Misspellings in mass emails. Spell check is free, people!
@BornLiar I know, right! Between being quoted by @TempletonRye and a response from @peggyolson, I'm in geek heaven! Mmmm, @Don_Draper.
@peggyolson I have a feeling Maidenform won't be quite as enjoyable as the Electrosizer was.
Smoke detectors went off at home this morning. Now I must listen to Rilo Kiley.
I made a vhs dub today. Why? Who still has a vcr?
@DMMC Tons of great shows coming to town the next couple months. Rad!
@amywright If you can't get a hold of the Joan Jett shirt, Bust also offers a lovely Golden Girls top!
When a new follower has the number 69 in it, I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess it's a spammer.
@hillabean My WWJD t-shirt says "What Would Joan Jett do?"
@nathantwright Nate, huh? You just don't seem like a Nate to me. Peter, maybe.
@nathantwright Just got that email as well.  **swoons**
@flysupes @nathantwright As long as Draper's handsome mug shows up on my feed from time to time, I kinda don't care if they're legit.
Of course I can get all this stuff done by end of day...by 5? Not so much.
@BornLiar Realizing the depth of my geektitude, because I'm seriously thrilled to read that Draper had a lunch meeting with Rog and Duck.
@BornLiar OMG! That made may day, and perhaps my life. And Joan too!
Why am I accumulating so many porny looking followers today?
@hswell Time for you to Face Your Manga! All the cool kids are doin' it!  http://www.faceyourmanga.com/welcome.htm
@TempletonRye On the rocks...the rocks never tasted so good.
I will make the requested change. But you are wrong and it doesn't look right. Just so we both know.
I love you fruity salt water taffy! Orange and blue raspberry.  Tasty.
@DMMC Yay Old 97's!!  So rad.
Almost noon and I'm still drinking coffee.  That's not good.
@frojive Drat! How did I miss that? I like Joe Purdy but am busy tonight. Blurg.
Finally a free day! My media drives are a disaster.
@amywright Me too! A friend's mom spotted the dress she wore to her prom on the show. Betty wore it. Pretty cool.
@amywright Not alone. Not in the least. Mr. Draper, he's so very...persuasive. And I totally have a girl-crush on Joan.
@BornLiar Don Draper is the best thing about Sundays.
Just had my favorite meal. Caprese salad with tasty farmer's market tomotoes and far more fresh mozzarella than necessary.
@nathantwright Slacks is one of my top three least favorite words of all time. Both the word and article of clothing are unsettling.
@BornLiar Wes Anderson is the default setting on my movie reference decoder.
@BornLiar Yes, and they were doing sit-ups under the table between customers.
Drinking some tasty grape Kool-aid purchased from some kids down the street.
@chewbocka That reminds me that the song "Ditty" by Paperboy shuffled up on Itunes the other day. I realize I shouldn't admit that.
Just bought beer and firewood.  Almost time for backyard fire pit!
@BrettTrout We are not related. We are in the cute choppy bob hairdo cult, however.
Success! Friend was forced to wear sombraro at Mi Mexico and I have just enough tequila in my body to get me through the rest of the day.
@BornLiar Sit-down dinners are both hilarious and satisfying...sleep deprived or not!
Heading to Mi Mexico for lunch margaritas (best evah!). Hoping my friend will be forced to don a sombraro for her bday.
@soZealous Wes Anderson themed wedding?  That's the coolest thing I've ever heard,
True 48hr story...while editing our rough cut we considered naming a character Bruce Willis. This was hilarious in our sleep deprived minds.
@soZealous, @Kathy_L Team A Sense of Urgency also huge Wes fans, illustrated by character name "Corky Wesanderson," the mom in our film.
Chiming in on the kudos to all tweeps involved in 48 Hour! Saw lots of great films last night!
Congrats also to @soZealous 's team for best use of graphics!
Yay "Consensus!"  Congrats to @Kathy_L, @forjive, @hswell, @bornliar!  Well done team.  Celebratory drinks soon!
Looking forward to the 48Hr Best of City Screening tonight!  Good luck to all invovled!
I just ate a Fruit Rollup. It was fun & delicious. It said Boo Yeah on it. Neat.
@juice_brianne Bowling alleys also have their own particular smell. A very strange smell.  What is that?
Think I'll head down to @EastVillageBook to find a dream interpretation book for a friend who has the most insane dreams.
@awesome_andrea Rad! Banana Grabber's first dream sequence! I imagine a kicky little theme song playing while BG tools around on the segway.
@BornLiar If it helps, you don't look a day over 37.
@youwithoutme Don't know any bands, however, band that takes their name from Strictly Ballroom = Awesome.
@Kathy_L Excellent suggestions!
@amywright  Amy was in Ames in Feb or March. For free! Last time David was here, I somehow wrangled box seats. So awesome.
@KevinMcCarthy Sedaris will be at the Civic Center in Oct. Already have my tix! Flames is good, but my least favorite of his books.
@EastVillageBook @frojive I'm finishing Dry right now!
I'd like to stop coughing now.
@amywright Knowing the ref could be good, no?  Also, you need to teach me how to knit.  We will make tea cozies for Bret and Jermaine.
Damn!  The American swimmers are fire!
Michael Phelps is unreal.
Pretty sure I need to start stalking Bret and Jermaine.
"Consensus" will be showing this Thursday at the 48Hr Best of City Screening.  Last chance to get creeped out by @Kathy_L & @frojive!
Today is totally a patio lunch kind of day.
@garlicgirl Friends in Madison live near the "Wisconsin Cheeseman" a cheese mall.  It is heaven.
@CatRocketship The summer cold is horrible!!  I stayed home from work today.  It's nice and sunny out and I feel awful.
I don't really like going to the fair.  Am I the only one?
Damien Rice is the perfect soundtrack for this morning.  Mellow yet angsty.
Okay, I definitely have a cold.  And I am not pleased.
Sore throat. I think I'm getting a cold. Summer colds are the worst.
@BornLiar Go ahead and blame it on the mullet.  I always do.
Ice cream sandwiches are perfect.
Canoeing is an olympic sport?  I had no idea.
@BornLiar Go buy Strong Bad on your next trip to the geek store.  Then invite me over to play it!
@amywright 'Tis true, fishy forearms are no good.
I didn't know single-spacing was a thing.  I'm old school.
@amywright Ha! Tough choice.
@Kathy_L Excellent choice! Today though, I was looking for something super unhealthy.  Mr. John, assemble your fattiest meats and cheeses!
Jimmy John's number 5, I love you.  But now I smell oniony.  I don't love that.
@daniAWESOME I hate when I leave 105.1 tuned in in the car and that douche  greets me in the morning.  Contrived, misogynistic jackass.
Just made tasty greek turkey burgers for dinner.  Yum!
I have wasted a mass amount of time today.
Heard some Paul Simon on @capital1063. It reminded me of when I as a kid and thought Chevy Chase sang "You Can Call me Al."
Having trouble getting going today.  Somebody's got a case of the mondays!
@frojive I would assume so.  I'm sure the judges will have some input on that as well.
Congrats to all involved with the 48hr Film "Consensus!"  Runners-up for the Group B Audience Award! Yay @BornLiar,@hswell,@Kathy_L,@frojive
Just got back from the 48Hr showing.  Good stuff.  Yay local filmmakers!!
Don't forget the 48Hr Film Project screenings!  Come see @Kathy_L and @frojive on the big screen!  Group B at 7:00 and 9:30 Fleur Cinema.
@johnerobinson Looks cool!  What team are you on?
I have a very specific Photoshop aesthetic.  I call it "Bad Photoshop."  It seems to work for me.
@awesome_andrea Apple II in elementary school.  Oregon Trail owned me.  Thankfully, I no longer have dysentery.
This coffee is burning a hole in my stomach.
Eating Cheez-its to balance my heinous garlic breath.  I don't think it's helping.
Super garlic-y pizza.  Is there anything better?  No, no there isn't.
@BrettTrout There's an audience award, but other than that not sure. I heard a DJ from 105.1 is a judge this year.
@BrettTrout Wednesday and Thursday night at the Fleur.  Consensus is in Group B, showing Wed. 7 & 9:30.
@amywright I've always wanted to be somebody's hero!  Thank all for the kind words!
@BornLiar Forgot to mention masterful writing by, well, @BornLiar.
@Kathy_L If loving the Monkees is wrong, I don't wanna be right.  #musicalskeleton= Never Been to Me by Charlene.  It's the subtle whoring.
@frojive @Kathy_L   gives good sinister. *chills*
@schippers Mad Men was fab per usual.  Lots of good setup.  Don Draper, how I've missed you!
"Consensus," an A Sense of Urgency Production, is complete!  @hswell heading to the Fleur for drop off!
Still editing.  Switched to bloody marys.  Go team A Sense of Urgency!
Editing again.  Mainlining coffee and Bailey's.
Time to go, no more editing tonight.
Tired.  Eyes starting to bug out.
@BornLiar For reals.
Makin' a movie!  With @BornLiar, @frojive, @Kathy_L and @hswell.
@BornLiar So glad I'm not the writer...sleep well!
#ramday I fell down the stairs and twisted by spine when I was 8.  I also don't have a belly button.  Just a rad scar.
@johnerobinson I'm 48 Hour-ing it up!
Tons to do...can't seem to get anything done.  Arg.
@BornLiar I'm convinced that there is nothing better in the world than the margarita's at Mi Mexico.
Kidvatar activated!  How rad is my mesh t-ball hat!
Trying to explain Twitter to my friend, Kim...kinda hard do it w/ out showing her.  So this one's for her!
Ice cream sandwiches survived, and they are more important anyway.
Ankeny power back on!  Sadly, the bomb pops did not make it.
@hillabean Great dream!  Love the Deadliest Catch. I totally want to hangout on the Northwestern. Edgar is fave.
It needs to keep raining so I don't have to golf tonight.  I'm pretty sure my swing is broken.
Ipod is not responding to CPR.  I think she is dying.
Welcome back Mr. Banana Grabber.  See you at the big yellow joint!
@amywright @Kathy_L I'm pretty sure it was the paste that was tasty, not glue. That's my 5yr old memory.  Every class had a kid who ate it.
@frojive What I meant was, it's not so much Leo's face that's cute.  It's the belly.  And the chains.
@amywright Yes, though she's not a kitten anymore.  #petvatar day = so many cute pet faces! Minus @frojive, that is.
Sorry Mr. Banana Grabber, Kitten Winnie is just too cute to not be my avatar for the day.
@BornLiar Unfortunately, there wasn't enough money in the talent budget to hire Mr. Loaf.
The dude in the footage I'm logging needs a bro.  Or a mansiere, if you will.
My teeth hurt.
I like when my clients think I'm rad.
Today is a three cups of coffee kind of day.
I am too old to be staying up until 5 in the morning.
Ate at Sbrocco last night.  Best meal I've had in ages.  Everyone in group ordered something diferent and everything was magically delicious
Why are such bad decisions made thus ruining my day.  On a Friday.  Blurgh!
@BornLiar Is it all the ef bombs...the booze...the chest hair waxing?  What?
@flysupes My Boys' "Douche Intervention"...funniest scene on tv last fall.
Multiple shakers of original margarita at Mi Mexico with @BornLiar and @hswell = the opposite of FAIL.
I'm having margaritas for lunch today!
Living near Ankeny Summerfest is kind of nice.  Except for when the band is covering James Blunt.  Not beautiful.
I've just experienced a tweet being eaten for the first time! Is there a club I'm a part of now? Do I get to know the secret handshake?
Nothing seems to be going the way I want it to today.  I am not amused.
Sir Friedrich, I love waking up to you!  Hazelnut, tasty.
Trying so hard to resist the Cheezits.
My childhood BFF had the same clown as the one in Poltergeist.  The same one!  Scarred for life.
@BornLiar I'm totally getting new cards that say "Samurai of Footage" on them.  Thanks!
Junk mail subject: Eva Longoria stabs and injures maid.  Sadly, content of message didn't live up to subject line.
@BornLiar Hell of a headline, but nothing beats the Cambodian Midget Fighting League...except for that tiger, I guess.
@lindsayrees That's awesome! My cat is a pain in the ass 64% of the time, but I'd be so sad if she was gone.
@Kathy_L One point for my side!
The 12yr old side of me loved the violent badassery of "Wanted." The 32yr old side is perplexed by the Sewing Machine of Death, seriously?
@daniAWESOME @BornLiar, @awesome_andrea, Homestar is my personal savior.  Brett Bretterson FTW!!
@BornLiar Triple geek score indeed.  But did it have to be Marzipan?  She's kinda lame.  I'm a Bubs girl, myself.
Optimum bunk management.  That's a...thing.  Neat.
@juice_brianne Sarah Vowell is my hero.  I want to be her when I grow up!
World's largest hazelnut latte is treating me nice this morning.
@charris1980 You can still buy Orange Crush in bottles!  It's good, but it's no Faygo.  Rock and Rye!!
@amywright You had me at almost throwing down at the Mews...
Why am I so scattered today?  Ugh.
@amywright...as if you weren't already my hero!  Getting a letter read on NPR is like my nerdy dream come true!
@scHarvey Only a little...because either way, it's true.
That was a disappointing apple.
@BornLiar Especially with world's best margarita's in your future.  Maybe you'll steal the baby jesus tonight.
@BornLiar ...and that I'm no longer allowed to work on grocery store spots.  Call me RT, but I just don't get it!
@BornLiar You may have forgotten that I already know the authority on high 5-ing and finger guns.
The Ting Tings is a great soundtrack for a friday.
@frojive Minds are nice, but not always necessary.
@amywright Shooting this year's football commercial.  It's the most wonderful time of the year.  Me...shallow?  Um, yes.
Just got back from a trip to buy baby oil.  To be rubbed on muscle-y football arms.  Go cyclones.
Friends who drop lattes off at work for you are the best kind of friends.
Magical mojitos sound...magical.  And minty.  I'm in!
I'm gonna need to find a lot more energy before I go out for drinks tonight.
I have a blister.  I put a bacon shaped band-aid on it.
Having a minor issue with the feisty cat.  There's a chance she may have to go on Prozac.  Nice.
Taking a feisty cat to the vet is no fun.  No fun at all.
@BornLiar No, but go with it.  You should also beat random people with bowling pins.  Feel free to make your own milkshake reference.
@BornLiar So you're finally watching The King of Kong, the best movie of 2007?  Team Wiebe!!
Hey, @BornLiar & @nathantwright...I hear Modern Day Samurai's playing at Shooter Joe's this weekend.  You in?
@Kathy_L I loved Money Trouble!  One of my favorites that year.
@nathantwright First the Addys and now you? Always ineligible...
@nathantwright @BornLiar I only wish I would have known how awesome that was when it happened. I didn't get to fully enjoy how cool I was.
@BornLiar Great film, was Jim in the shot?
@scHarvey Damn!  I've been caught. And I thought I was being stealthy.
Mr. Construction dude at Jimmy John's...I do not need to see nipple at lunch.  Thanks.
@KevinMcCarthy Came out 2wks ago. If you keep up on Sedaris, you will have already read/heard a lot of the new book. Not bad, but a letdown.
Reading the new David Sedaris.  Slightly disappointed.
Seriously?  I love Tim Russert!
There's a groundhog who hangs out in our backyard at work.  He was walking around all wonky-like.  I'm concerned.
Calypso has a vintage arcade game called Stripper.  I'm very curious about it.
@nathantwright I'm a badass!  Except not.  I still don't really know what goes on around here.  Don't tell anyone.
Picture I found online of One Mile Bridge http://tinyurl.com/43yykn	Picture I took last night http://twitpic.com/25a2
Between traffic ie. gawkers & flooding it took and hour to get home last night.  Usually takes 25 min. Drove over the mile bridge.  Crazy.
@Kathy_L Yep, I'm at AAT!  So, you've been here...
Just took this picture out of my office window.  http://twitpic.com/24is
@juice_brianne Meetings in general are a pet peeve of mine.
I just ate the best cupcake I've ever had in my life.
@nathantwright That person was wrong.  Sarrrrsgaarrrrd forever!
