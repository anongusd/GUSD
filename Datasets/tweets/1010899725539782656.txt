@JudgeJeanine @SebGorka Rather chew tinfoil! Lies, Lies, Lies!
@GOP @FLOTUS @StephGrisham45 She should start at home with social media safety. The President is very dangerous!
@mitchellvii No Rep should be using the lie card! Lying should be their platform!
@BuckSexton 37 Indictments in the Russian probe.....hardly a hoax!

@realDonaldTrump This is the exact reason you are an embarrassment to the Country. You would have been better off not saying anything. This sounds like such bullshit. You don't have these emotions.
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @POTUS As usual he wasn't prepared. He thought his charisma would close the deal. Doesn't work that way in the political world
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump And trump has failed miserably! Spin it anyway you want.....Trump is doing it for ratings!
@RealJamesWoods Questìon? Do you think Trump is at all to blame for how he is treated?
@EricTrump A Trump should never accuse anyone of lying!
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump Really.….then why does Kushner have clearance. Liar!!

@simonamangiante @GeorgePapa19 Who fuckin cares!

@seanhannity I'd rather chew tinfoil!
@realJeffreyLord @DailyCaller Is this your weak attempt at bipartisanship? You already have no credibility so go away!

@DineshDSouza What's your comment on @RepMarkMeadows video talking about Obama. Throw that on your stupid pile!
@WalshFreedom This is a game show to him. Its all about ratings!
@RepMarkMeadows Spin it anyway you want. He was lying for the President. That is the real story here. Trump is a criminal and you cowards don't challenge him.
@Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows Meadows should resign! What an embarrassment you both were yesterday!
@RyanAFournier @CPAC @DiamondandSilk Promoting hate! Dividing the Country! Is that what you mean?

@charliekirk11 Lying for Trump
@RyanAFournier For lying on behalf of Trump!
@larryelder @MarkMeadows Meadows is a racist himself! Nice argument!
@GOP It's sad then whenever Trump seems to be in trouble, Reps blame the Clintons. What a joke!
@GOP @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump It sad that Rep has become a party of no values. I hope this is not what America represents.
@mitchellvii And Trump!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Too bad he keeps embarrassing America! Wake up!
@GOP Trump wasted his time. He tried a publicity stunt and it failed.

@DonaldJTrumpJr Meadows is a racist.....spin it anyway you want Jr!
@LouDobbs @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Are you fucking kidding me?? He is a disgrace. He believes a ruthless dictator over a dead American. How can any sane person accept this behavior. Even you Lou you ass kisser!
@senatemajldr And you should speak out against him siding with a dictator over a dead American! WTF is wrong with this behavior not being called out by Rep??
@DonaldJTrumpJr @MailOnline Who fucking cares you criminal!
@RepGosar Will Trump stand up for American's or continue to side with Dictators? Shame on all of you for not speaking up!
@GOP @GOPChairwoman Truthful and Republican should never be used in the same sentence. You are lying about this just like you do about everything!
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Any comment about his siding with the dictator on a dead American?? I didn't think so. Don't be such a coward!!
@mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 RESIGN!!
RT @Weinsteinlaw: People @realDonaldTrump will criticize:		Spike Lee	Cast of SNL	Hillary Clinton 	Gold Star Families 	Black Athletes	The Me…
@GOP Trump...Rep biggest liar!
@AdamBaldwin Who will?
@mitchellvii Tell me something? Do you think Trumps behavior in general represents American values? Lying, paying off porn stars etc?
@RepMarkMeadows What a joke. You embarrassed yourself today. You may want to quiet down for a bit!
@GeraldoRivera @MichaelCohen212 @realDonaldTrump Don't bury the fact that Rep attacked Cohen for lying but remember who he was lying for!
@kaitlancollins He sounds like he is 7!!
@GOPLeader Rep should be embarrassed today with their behavior. Attacking a man that lied to protect a liar they are never questioning. Brutal!!
@WalshFreedom Education is a must in this day and age. it's not a choice if you want to be somewhat successful
@RepGosar You should be embarrassed at your behavior today. You criticize Cohen for lying but you never question Trumps behavior. Is this normal for someone to accept this behavior?
@TomiLahren It's official....you are an idiot!
@mitchellvii Trumps approval rating with brown people is 20%. See, I can make shit up too!
@mschlapp @CPAC @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan Jordan and Meadows were an embarrassment to the country today! What the hell were you watching??
@GOPChairwoman What the hell do you think Trump has done his whole life?? What a joke!
@PARISDENNARD @RepRashida @RepMarkMeadows @LynnePatton Bullshit! Meadows was an embarrassment to America today. Grandstanding and making a mockery of the process. He should apologize!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump You really must be worried with all these tweets. It makes you look desperate.....how do you defend Trumps behavior and sleep at night. What an embarrassment!
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump You have no right to accuse anyone of lying. Your daughter is the second biggest liar in America! You should sit this one out!
@GOP So what....he has a right to live his life after a prison sentence! Remember the prison reform act that you bragged about??
@GOPChairwoman Spin it anyway you want. He was credible and Trump took a beating today.
@mitchellvii What an embarrassment for America? WTF is wrong with American values these days??
@realJeffreyLord Do you agree with what Gaetz did?
@kayleighmcenany How the hell can you accuse someone of lying. The President has lied constantly over the past two plus years and you defend him to a fault?? Talk about zero credibility. This is not American values!!! Wake up America!!
@DonaldJTrumpJr This coming from the family that has lied thousands of times!
@Jim_Jordan You embarrassed yourself again today. Did any of you Rep even defend Trump?
@DonaldJTrumpJr A trump should not question anyone on lying....
@cjstewa84800248 @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump That's because he made up medical bullshit so he didn't have to go. He's a coward!
@DonaldJTrumpJr JR, you don't have much credibility so go away!
@GOP @RepCloudTX Rep were an embarrassment today! BTW, not one of them defended Trump
@GOPChairwoman Now you believe him? Typical
@GOPChairwoman And Trump?? Hypocrite. Why do you even tweet liar when you are a Rep??
@GOP What happened to fake news!?
@Jim_Jordan @BuzzFeedNews You embarrassed yourself today......again!
@GOP That doesn't mean he isn't a criminal!
@marklevinshow Spin it anyway you want. Cohen was believable and this was not a good day for the Pres. Also, most of the Rep embarrassed themselves today.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump I am pretty sure you just described the President! Beside, who do you think he was lying for?
@WalshFreedom Party over Country!
@RepMarkMeadows You are such a joke. Stop embarrassing yourself!
@GovMikeHuckabee Not sure you should be talkimg about truth. You and your daughter are in then too 3 liars in the nation!
@RepMarkMeadows You are an embarrassment to the country! What has happened to American values?
@EricTrump @realDonaldTrump Your family is a National disgrace! You have embarrassed the country over and over again! Your values are not what America stands for. Go away!
@PARISDENNARD Spin it anyway you want. Cohen was lying to protect Trump! Now he can tell the truth about what  criminal the whole Trump clan are. How can any sane person think Trumps behavior is normal?
@GOP Who do you think he was lying for? No Rep should ever talk about lying. You have the biggest liar on the planet in the WH!
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Are you telling me Rep wouldn't do the same? If Trump committed a crime, does that not bother you? You have become a disgrace. What happened to American values??
@GOP It's obvious Trump is a criminal. Spin it anyway you want!
@GeraldoRivera So you think it should be just ignored that Trump may have committed a crime?? What is wrong with you?
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Yes and old bone spur Trump has such a deep connection. STFU!
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump Yes, and what did Rep try to do to Clinton??
@IngrahamAngle Remember who he was lying for? No Rep should talk about lying.....you are all complicit to Trumps lies!
@alexanderbruz @realDonaldTrump Never happen. Trump will end up looking like a fool. Again!
@charliekirk11 Guess who he was lying for??!!
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @MichaelCohen212 And I would hope you would not be okay with Trumps behavior. GR, where there is smoke there is fire. The Trump organization is crooked and always has been. Spin it anyway you want! These are not American values
@TVAshleigh I think Trump should get on a plane and head back to the US. Time to face the music!
@johncardillo @SpeakerPelosi You are okay with someone threatening a witness?? You also know that Cohen was lying for Trump remember. Spin it anyway you want, Cohen could bring down this criminal President if he wanted!
@realDonaldTrump Glad to see you are embracing Socialism when it suits your agenda
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Your party is quick to vilify anyone who doesn't agree with a lying, porn star buying, Russian loving President? WTF is wrong with you people??
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump So you are okay with him committing crimes? That is what the Rep party is now.....wtf is wrong with you people.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump At one time Trump praised Cohen. You are such fucking hypocrites! What a American disgrace this administration is.
@mattgaetz You are a disgrace. And no one in the Rep party should be talking about liars! You have the biggest lying criminal of them all!

@GOP @realDonaldTrump @VP Are you kidding me?? America is the laughing stock around the world. What a joke!!
@GOPLeader @POTUS Hypocrite! Trump is declaring this is 100% political. What about Mexico paying? This is a big game show to him. What a joke!
@GovMikeHuckabee @FoxNews Look on the bright side. You don't have to lie like your daughter!
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump Are you kiddimg me? There will be no end to anything. You are smarter then That! Trump is doing this as a publicity stunt!
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump This is such an embarrassment to your country! This is just a political move that will waste taxpayer money. Fix the border problems the correct way. Btw wasn't Mexico supposed to pay?
@KristySwansonXO @RealJamesWoods @newtgingrich Newt is probably the biggest reason the country is so divided. He is a joke!
@RyanAFournier Proof? Liar!
@newtgingrich I thought Rep didn't like Socialists? Especially mass murdering Socialists!
@GOP @realDonaldTrump He's been lying for Trump!! Spin it anyway you want.
@realDonaldTrump Another lie.....Sad this is what American values are now.
@marklevinshow No Trump supporter should accuse someone of being a liar!
@realDonaldTrump How are the bone spurs?
@mitchellvii Um, you're calling Cohen a liar? Guess who he has been lying for?
@PressSec @POTUS I expect we will hear lots of lies over the next day. What a disgrace!
@GOPChairwoman Trump can't say enough good things about Kim Jung who is a socialist!
@mitchellvii How do you know what he will say?? I hear he has tape recordings. See, I can make shit up too!
@realDonaldTrump Starting your day with your usual lie?? You are such a disgrace to American values!
@GovMikeHuckabee Well I see where your daughter gets her lying values. STFU!
@newtgingrich @realDonaldTrump Says the man who divided the country more then anyone! I thought Trump didn't go to Nam because of bone spurs?
@LindseyGrahamSC It's not a hard call for you because you have become a kiss ass with no original thoughts. #mexicopay
@GOP @DonaldJTrumpJr What a disgrace. Why is this idiot on TV. Reality show was cancelled!
@RyanAFournier You just described Trump!! This is a big game show to him.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump You have become the biggest kiss ass in Washington. What do they have on you?
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump When he doesn't walk you will kiss his ass regardless. What a joke!
@realDonaldTrump Vietnam??? Watch those bone spurs!
@realDonaldTrump I can't believe American think your behavior is acceptable. What the hell is wrong with people! Wake up America! Your country is a laughing stock because of this kind of lack of leadership!
@realDonaldTrump I assume your lying!?
@charliekirk11 Or maybe they are smart enough to see that Trump is ruining your once great country! Wake up America!
@TomiLahren I care....stfu!
@RealJamesWoods This is exactly why you don't have any credibility! What a joke you are!
@TaxReformExpert So you are okay with the Russian interfering in Democratic elections? Nice position! Wake up America....these idiot don't give a shit about the country!

@GOP @marc_lotter You mean like Mexico paying for the wall? What a joke
@johncardillo That's because you're an idiot!
@WalshFreedom Don't waste your time on that idiot!
@JasonMillerinDC @azfamily Is it a requirement of the Rep party that you must be a liar to join??
@realDonaldTrump You are the king of fake news! What does that make you?
@SaraCarterDC Your nation once was great....now it is a laughing stock and more divided then ever. Wake up America!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump It wasn't a problem two years ago? What happened? Liars!
@GOPLeader He is committed to continuing to lie!
@RealJamesWoods This is the kind of tweet that gives you zero credibility!
@marklevinshow Don't you think Trump has partly created this environment of hate and violence?? He is constantly attacking people and it has now become normal behavior. America should be ashamed!
@RealJamesWoods Who gives a shit about this guy! Old news, move on!
@GOP @realDonaldTrump This was funded in 2009. Lying again. Also he is not keeping his promise unless he received a cheque from Mexico.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Truth and Trump should never be used in the same sentence!
@KristySwansonXO @realDonaldTrump It's a lie. This was money from 2009. Wake up America!
@realDonaldTrump This is a lie as usual. This was financed in 2009. Any new funding is coming from Mexico, correct!?
@WalshFreedom Not to mention he shouldn't be accusing anyone of being a liar! His daughter is the second biggest liar in the country!
@TuckerCarlson Because someone disagreed with you?
@RealJamesWoods So you're okay with the Russians interfering in our elections?
@GovMikeHuckabee Your daughter should be next if they arresting liars!
@mitchellvii @AnnCoulter Does @anncoulter know trump has $2 for his stupid wall? See I can make shit up too!
@GOP @LaraLeaTrump Who the fuck cares what either of these two buffoons think!
@GeraldoRivera You could show a lot of videos of Trump lying. Did you post any of those GR? Don't be a hypocrite. You are better then that!
@mitchellvii They elected a reality tv host so anything is possible!
@kimguilfoyle Who cares!
@sjl9069 @mitchellvii huh?
@helper2 @GOP @SteveScalise Less guns means less gun violence....very simple!
@GOP @ChuckGrassley @RepKevinBrady Nice try
@Harlan @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Obama raised $100m in first term. See, I can make shit up too!!
@RealJamesWoods Nice way to debate but typical. If you don't like someone's position, you refer to the mother card. What a joke!
@GOPChairwoman Donald Trump is the biggest liar on the planet!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Your old man will be doing the same to you eventually!
@GOP @SteveScalise Gun Control you hypocrite!
@GOP @GOPChairwoman Ah because the President is a lunatic?? How you people think his behavior is acceptable and represents American values is a joke! Wake up America!!
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump And of course you are calling out Trump for siding with Putin over his intelligence agency?? Hypocrite!
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump GR, spin it anyway you want. Trump is to blame for this environment of lies, blame, deflection. He has created this mess and it will take years for the country and leadership to recover. Wake up America!
@NikkiHaley Welcome to the Trump presidency! He has created this atmosphere of hate, bullying lying, deflecting and blaming the Clintons. Spin it anyway you want, he is to blame. You cowards are complicit.
@realDonaldTrump Liar....you did many times.
@marklevinshow Donald Trump, bigger liar!
@realDonaldTrump You are the biggest liar on the planet. You should be embarrassed to even send out a tweet like this! Do you actually think anyone believe anything that comes out of your fingers??
@realDonaldTrump So Presidential!
@HOsantowskeMI @kayleighmcenany She is a joke with absolutely no credibility.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump That is because of Trumps outrages behavior. It happens for a reason you know!!
@realDonaldTrump Kinda like you with Putin!
@realDonaldTrump Oh look another lie!!
@GeraldoRivera That and a racist President!
@realDonaldTrump None of your tweets should ever contain the word "lies" when talking about someone else. You are the biggest liar on the planet and everyone knows that.
@realDonaldTrump How's that National Emergency thing going? I forgot you are golfing. Maybe later.
@LukeRussert All have been until Trump!
@RepMarkMeadows Wrong...they were trying to protect the country. Something you idiots seem to ignore. Wake up America!!
@mitchellvii Same thing he has done to all Americans. Committed crimes, lied constantly and totally embarrassed the country!
@The_Trump_Train Trump declared an emergency to aid TRUMP! Nothing else and no one else. He could give two shits about the border!
RT @MrsNormanToYou: Too funny that the no wall getting, no crowd pulling, porn star paying, military dodging, child caging, travel banning,…
@kimguilfoyle Trump is an embarrassment to your country. He is a laughing stock and anyone who doesn't see that is blind. Wake up America!
Anyone who retweets this should be investigated! https://t.co/QdPZPHKybn
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Bongino is the biggest idiot on the planet! Who gives a crap what he thinks!
@shannonrwatts @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends He only wants to debate someone who agrees with him. He is the biggest right wing idiot on the planet. A bully and dangerous to the country!
@TommyHicksGOP @realDonaldTrump How the fuck do you know!? STFU!
@DrDenaGrayson @realDonaldTrump He doesn't give a shit about his son! It is about him and no one else his whole life.
@MariaBartiromo @GOPLeader @FoxNews @SundayFutures @WhiteHouse Of course he does.....he is an ass kisser!
@RealSaavedra If it happened to a Rep, you would all be doing the same. It was news and people reacted. Don't make anymore of it. Hypocrites!
@TaxReformExpert This is a stupid tweet. Trump doesn't give a shit about minorities unless it makes him look good. Saying he is not a racist because the economy helped a minority is idiotic!
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump I honestly think he would sacrifice Jr to save his own skin. That is how selfish he really is!
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump Embarrassing day for America!
@mitchellvii 20% of voters agreed with President Trump on Immigration in his #SOTU speech. See, I can make shit up too!
@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Is Mexico paying. You people are a joke!
@RepMarkMeadows Gun control?
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Oh good....a big lie fest at 10 am. How people think his behavior is acceptable is a joke! What an embarrassment to your once great country!
@mschlapp But Trumps corruption will not be gone!
@johncardillo @brianstelter You idiots are more worried about how someone is arrested then the fact they actually committed a crime. What a joke. The guys is a criminal and deserves to be treated that way!
@mschlapp Remember when Trump said Mexico would pay for the wall??
@PARISDENNARD @realDonaldTrump Haha! He has had his ass handed to him. Even his own party thinks hes a joke!
@DonaldJTrumpJr I do more then any Trump!
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump You are a smart man GR. Where there is smoke there is fire. Trump is a gangster and surrounds himself with the same!
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @POTUS What a joke! All to save face with an idiotic base!
@simonamangiante Who cares!
@marklevinshow Ya Roger Stone doesn't have much more credibility then you!
@AnnCoulter That's because it is a waste of money!
@RyanAFournier So should the Trump family!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Mexico can pay for it.....oh right you assholes lie about everything!
@thedeeraddict @RyanAFournier Nice graph but it's bullshit. No country has the gun violence death rate due to guns. You aren't including suicides. Spin it anyway you want.....America is the only country with gun violence that's crazy. More guns then people!
@larryelder You have just preached the real crisis in your country. Weapons! The Wall is a joke! Wake up America!
@charliekirk11 Embarrassing! 		Mexico was supposed to pay. The wall is a waste of money!		Guns are a crisis in your country!
@SenTedCruz How about you fight a real crisis with guns! Wake up America! You are the only country that has gun violence that is out of control!
@SenTedCruz 2/3 of American don't want the wall jackass!
@mschlapp Because we don't want the truth??? WTF is wrong with you idiots?
@mitchellvii How is 1000's of gun deaths not a National Emergency? 99.9% of illegals are just looking to better their life. Guns kill people at a rate like no other country! Wake up America!
@LindseyGrahamSC @60Minutes The stunning thing is that you support this presidents behavior even though you know it's bad for America! Wtf happened to you?
@seanhannity You are a liar!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Guns are a fucking crisis!
@WalshFreedom @RandPaul @tedcruz @SenMikeLee @BenSasse Nope....they don't give two shits about the country....just their re-elections!
@AnnCoulter He's been destroying it for over 2 years!
@mitchellvii You know what he should do?? Get fucking Mexico to pay for his stupid wall!
@LisaMarieBoothe @thehill And what's wrong with that?? Guns are a crisis! Far more then the stupid wall that Mexico was paying for. The National emergency should be getting this baffoon out of the White House!
@mitchellvii Its a national emergency to him because he will lose 2020 without his stupid wall. Guns are a far bigger crisis in America. Wake up America!
@RepMarkMeadows Guns are a national emergency and a far bigger crisis in America. Get your priorities straight! Wake up America. Get ready for the next Dem Pres to use the National Emerg card!
@thedeeraddict @RyanAFournier Guns are a far bigger crisis than the border. You are influenced by the fear mongering!
@senatemajldr How are your communities safe when there are more guns then people?? Get your priorities straight you cowards!
@Jim_Jordan You forgot to list all the people indicted! What a embarrassment that you idiots support Trump.
@GarrettHaake @JohnCornyn I thought I heard somewhere Mexico was paying?? How is that a victory if Americans are now footing the bill. He lost bad!
@GarrettHaake @JohnCornyn I think the President should resign and move on!
@JohnCornyn It's called compromise! Also called a waste of money that Mexico was supposed to pay for!
@mitchellvii I bet if you saw Trumps tax returns you would find it "weird" also.
@JohnCornyn @politico Why doesn't he get Mexico to pay like he promised! He should get ZERO!
@charliekirk11 Trump net work now is 10 billion	Obama net worth now 10 million	Clinton net worth now 10 million		Look, I can make shit up too!
@TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump If he wants his stupid wall, get Mexico to pay like he promised!
@RyanAFournier Give him ZERO! Get it from Mexico like he promised!
@KristySwansonXO What do her looks have to do with anything? How shallow!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Oh look at you making up fake News! What else is new??
@GOP @VP Are you kidding me? You hypocrite!
@kimguilfoyle Who fucking care! Go away both of you!
@mitchellvii @gatewaypundit I thought I heard somewhere that Mexico was paying? Must have been another fucking lie!
@mitchellvii Trumps approval rating is 20%. That is all you need to know.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Oh look....another lie! What a joke your family is!
@realDonaldTrump Talk about wasting money! No Border Wall! Hey did you see the deficit is 22 trillion? Nice work jackass!
@VP You are a hypocrite! The President should resign then??!!
@realDonaldTrump No wall!....Mexico paying?
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls @PressSec Tell them to stop fucking lying!! WTF is wrong with you people. It is such a joke they get away with this crap. They are supposed to work for all Americans!
@marklevinshow Are you kidding me??? Trump is a racist anti Semite. Open your eyes. You have no credibility!
@seanhannity @AlanDersh @GreggJarrett OMG will you get over the Clintons!? What a joke you are. Move on!
@Jim_Jordan He should have picked up a cheque from Mexico since he was down there. #dowhatyousaid
@VP @IlhanMN You are a hypocrite!
@RyanAFournier @realDonaldTrump @MSNBC Do you actually believe that?
@AndrewPollackFL It's so sad you're country need to do this? I still believe adding more guns to a situation isn't the answer. Get rid of what's out there.
@larryelder @Twitter maybe people just don't like your bullshit!
@seanhannity Everything you did for Obama's presidency was because you hated him. STFU you hypocrite!
@RyanAFournier You forgot 30+ indictments jackass!
@RubinReport And what do you call FOX?
@kayleighmcenany 30+++ indictments!! WTF are you talking about!
@realDonaldTrump Did you pick up your cheque from Mexico for your stupid wall while you were down there?
@realJeffreyLord @DailyCaller Since he is Trumps most trusted advisor I guess there will be no deal. What a joke that Trump takes advice from this Jerry Springer want to be!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Until you bastards are in Prison!
@realJeffreyLord @BreitbartNews You have examples from both sides I assume? Of course not. You are becoming more of a joke everyday! No credibility!
@WalshFreedom Is there anything on twitter anymore that is actually true? All I read is bullshit lies from both sides. Pure propaganda bullshit!
@BreitbartNews @DonaldJTrumpJr Who cares what that idiot thinks. He is as big a liar as his old man! They are an embarrassment to the country!
@LouDobbs @POTUS He is an embarrassment to the country! How can any sane person think his behavior is normal and good for the country!
@KatrinaPierson That is a lie fest! What an embarrassment to the country!
@marklevinshow Why hasn't Trump been removed from office hypocrite!
@JDiamond1 @realDonaldTrump Lies!
@DonaldJTrumpJr You are a criminal....I am surprised you wouldn't want to be treated well?
@realJeffreyLord @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @FoxNews Why would we want to watch a big lie fest?! How you think this is normal behavior is beyond me!
@marklevinshow Trumps approval rating is 20%. See i can make shit up Too!
@mitchellvii Only one illegal comes across the border a day. See I can make shit up too!!
@realJeffreyLord @nypost I don't know how you can defend his behavior? He lies and doesn't give a shit what anyone thinks. It blows my mind that people think this is normal.
@joncoopertweets @PeteHegseth This is the stupidest thing I have ever heard. What an idiot!
@realDonaldTrump @tommcclintock I guess the Art of the Deal and the great negotiator is out the window. Just because you can't get your way doesn't make it an emergency! Wake up America....this lying fear monger is out of control.
@realDonaldTrump oh look...a lie! Shocking!
@realDonaldTrump hahaha....now that's funny. Do you ever tell the truth?
@realDonaldTrump @JesseBWatters 8000++++++ lies since taking office. You are a joke!
@marklevinshow It's sad that America is now represented by a lying, porn star buying, sexual predator, election stealing criminal and people are okay with that! Morals are out the window. What a sad statement!
@realDonaldTrump Just the usual....you are lying!
@realDonaldTrump 20% approval rating....see I can make shit up too!!
@RealJamesWoods You know...it's still snows sometimes even though the planet is changing.....you ignorant prick!
@RealCandaceO This is an offensive tweet! Why do you have to be so evil?
@GOPChairwoman Lies again i see!
@GeraldoRivera @TuckerCarlson He broke the fucking law! Why aren't you outraged at that?
@NikkiHaley Does it not protect children  from getting slaughtered by an assault rifle??
@kayleighmcenany @seanhannity @dbongino Your President is a sexual assaulter......who's the hypocrite!
@mitchellvii Doing nothing about Sandy Hook!
@SteveGuest @kayleighmcenany @DailyCaller @amber_athey GOP should apologize for Kayleigh! She is a joke. Zero credibility!
@GOP @Liz_Cheney What about kids in schools? You need to do both!!
@DonaldJTrumpJr @DailyCaller 30+++ indictments mean it was worth while. Why should people be able to break the law?? BTW, it's not over!
@BillOReilly Biggest kiss ass book in history I suspect. Will you call him out for the liar he is??
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @RepAdamSchiff Ah, there has been over 30 indictments from Mueller. I think there was some wrongdoing. Sugar coat it all you want.....Trump knew what was happening. It will come out. He might get off being Pres. but he was involved.
@GOP @VP WTF? He is the biggest liar on the planet. What the hell is wrong with you people!
@benshapiro She's got it thanks to Trump!
@GOPChairwoman Why don't you worry about your own party!? How about Trump resigns for all his crimes! It's coming!
@realDonaldTrump Obama wasn't a criminal!
@realDonaldTrump Stop being a criminal!
@AnnCoulter Oh ya....what are your bullshit facts?
@mitchellvii Because it's probably a fuckin lie! Not sure if you noticed but he tends to make shit up quite often.
@WalshFreedom The KKK costume is obviously offensive. But I dressed up as Bob Marley when I was in HS because I idolized him. I don't think there was anything wrong with that but maybe I am wrong?
@TomiLahren We need Mexico to pay because Trump said they would pay!
@JackKingston @realDonaldTrump No, he is a compulsive liar if you haven't noticed. How can you support his behavior? It makes no sense that sane people think it's normal!
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Embarrassing!
@GOP @kayleighmcenany Who cares what Kayleigh thinks? She is the biggest kiss ass around. No credibility!
@kayleighmcenany @instagram @washingtonpost Who cares.....go away!!
@RyanAFournier Trump has lied over 9000 times since taking office. You don't seem to care about that!! STFU
@GOPLeader @RepAnnWagner What about young school children getting slaughtered by a weapon that fires multiple bullets in a very short time? How about you speak up for their lives....hypocrite!!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Why don't you go spend time with your kids instead of spending your life attacking people. What a sad existence!
@EricTrump @realDonaldTrump He had put the country back 50 years. It will take a long time to undo the damage he has done. America is also the laughing stock of the world!
@GOPChairwoman I agree but it isn't really your business. Your boss should also resign!
@kayleighmcenany @instagram @washingtonpost Well then stop attacking people. Rep talk about unifying the country but all I see is attack after attack starting at the top. I don't no how you people sleep at night!
@RepMarkMeadows @POTUS Well how about saying the same about the wall?? Majority of Americans don't support the wall. You can't use the argument when it is convenient.
@RepMarkMeadows Rep did the same when Obama spoke. Don't be a hypocrite!
@realJeffreyLord Rep don't believe any of Trumps accusers I assume? Hypocrites again!
@realJeffreyLord Who cares. Rep have done the same in the past. Not news!
@BillOReilly @NoSpinNews I thought it wasn't about winning or losing but uniting the country?? Oh I forgot you kiss asses will never admit Trumps behavior is ruining your once great country!
@DonaldJTrumpJr That's because she knows it's bullshit. All the fear mongering you idiots do makes a joke out of this Presidency! Americans are not that stupid!
@senatemajldr You hypocrite! You are a big part of the reason the country is so divided. STFU!
@senatemajldr He forgot to mention how he has put the country back 50 years and it will be a huge task to mend everything that he has ruined. And you are complicit!
@GOPChairwoman @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump Kayleigh has zero credibility. She is the biggest kiss ass around.
@mitchellvii I vote Trump is lying. Pretty safe bet!
@BuckSexton First sane thing he has said on CNN!
@IngrahamAngle @Morning_Joe If constant lies connect American....then the country is in worse shape then I thought! What a joke!
@mitchellvii I thought he was supposed to unify the country?? 30% of the country was happy!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump You should have left it at the first two points. Instead you have to continue to divide. What is wrong with you people!
@davidfrum How to lie??
@seanhannity @EricTrump @LindseyGrahamSC @tedcruz @RepMarkMeadows @SteveScalise @Jim_Jordan @dbongino @LawrenceBJones3 A bunch of liars supporting a liar and kissing his ass for an hour......no thanks!
@trish_regan @CLewandowski_ Don't be so hypocritical. This isn't the first SOTU and Rep have had the same behavior in the past. Plus, Trump lies so much it's hard to take him serious on anything!
@RealCandaceO hahaha....what a joke! Who was greatness? You have zero credibility!
@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump Are you kidding me? It was a disaster! He was all over the place. Does he actually work for the American people or 30%
@JackKingston I'm sure you jumped up when Obama spoke!
@BillOReilly This is a professional comment Bill. That's why you are viewed as the Jerry Springer of politics!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Go play with your kids duffuss!
@IngrahamAngle @CNN They shouldn't because it's bullshit fear mongering! Tell Trump to get his wall $$ from Mexico like he promised hundreds of times!
@mitchellvii Racism and guns by far the two biggest problems with your once great country!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Don't you get tired of attacking people all day long?? You really must lead a miserable life!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Trump sexually assaulted quite a few too! He is America's crisis!
@GOPChairwoman So does the President....hypocrite!
@PARISDENNARD @realDonaldTrump It will just be a big lie fest. It's really unbelievable that people support his behavior!
@mitchellvii But you're okay with a school being shot up and innocent children dying all in the name of what??
@JakeSherman @FLOTUS What a joke! Trump is the biggest bully on the planet!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Hope you get that cheque from Mexico by the 15th!
@KristySwansonXO Have you said the same in some of Trumps press conf?? Didn't think so
@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump It will be a big lie fest! I can't believe you people except his behavior! It's sick
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Party over Country! Pathetic!
@LouDobbs @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Of course they will....he's a criminal!
@TomiLahren This is terrible but fear mongering. There are 100's of murders to gun violence everyday and you idiots make this your crisis. it's a joke you are making this you're crisis. Wake up America!!
@DanCrenshawTX Do your homework....they don't make enough money.
@johncardillo @AOC BTW there are 100's of murders in America each day from gun violence. Doesn't matter the district!
@mitchellvii @AOC 4 years ago Trump was running a game show and he treat his current job the same!
@IngrahamAngle Why? Its a joke right now!
@DonaldJTrumpJr How about you fuckers tell the truth every once in a while!
@DaRealGrizzle 70% of America agrees.
@fordm REM
@GitRDoneLarry @MeerkatYitz I had a buddy break a hip bowling. The game has never been the same!
@realDonaldTrump I hear you're a cheater? Shocking! Disappointed they played with you.
@mitchellvii Good question and how can America let school children get slaughtered with a gun that shoots multiple bullets in seconds and do nothing about it! 	How?
@GOP @kayleighmcenany I don't know why you idiots let Kayleigh represent your party. She has zero credibility!
@mitchellvii Everything POTUS says is a lie!
@JackKingston In 2018 100,000 American died of gun violence. Look, i can make shit up too!. But guns are a much bigger crisis in your country!
@realDonaldTrump @FaceTheNation @CBS I big lie fest!
@RyanAFournier And Trump widen the gap then fold!
@LisaMarieBoothe What was your comment on Steve King? Hypocrite!
@KevoWray @RealDrGina Steve King's was indisputable??
@LisaMarieBoothe No rep will
@RealDrGina The difference is he will resign where I seem to not hear a word from Rep on Trump, King, Roy Moore....etc!
@KellyannePolls He will resign....too bad Rep don't have the same backbone!
@mitchellvii And you said the same about Trump I assume?
@RealJamesWoods Gun Control!
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump This is a huge mistake! It will end the Trump presidency. Although you have said that before. The majority of American don't want the wall!
@mitchellvii Are you fucking kidding me? So what is Trumps word?? He is the biggest liar on the planet.
@kayleighmcenany @CBP It was stopped.....no wall needed I guess!
@realDonaldTrump This should help getting them to the table to negotiate. Art of the deal?
@realDonaldTrump There was only 2 murders in Mexico in 2018. See I can lie too. No fucking wall!
@GOP See, who needs a stupid wall!!
@KellyannePolls And of course you included his actual explanation of this video? Didn't think so.....fake news!!
@mitchellvii Every Rep who doesn't support gun control should watch a class room of children being slaughtered in seconds with a gun shoot shoots multiple bullets in seconds! Hypocrite!
@WalshFreedom Sandy Hook!
@BillOReilly He's quite capable of not only embarrassing himself but your whole country!!
@newtgingrich Trumps tax cuts created 2 million lost jobs.....I can make shit up too. The rich got richer....that is all that happened.
@LindseyGrahamSC I guess it doesn't matter that he broke the law?
@kayleighmcenany It blows me away that you can judge like this but you are willing to do nothing when children are slaughtered by a weapon that unleashes 100's of bullets in a short time. It makes no sense.
@GovMikeHuckabee This is taken out of context as usual but I know you like to be dishonest. You need to include his clarification. You will do anything to be a slime ball!
@DonaldJTrumpJr They want to make sure your father gets paid!
@GOPChairwoman Don't worry, we will get Mexico to pay for it!!
@MAGAindex @DukePesta Ask Trump!
@kayleighmcenany You should take down this tweet or explain the context. This is bullshit!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Who are you to talk about Truth.....your old man is the biggest liar on the planet? Shame on America although I think he stole the election
@LindseyGrahamSC Who cares! He broke the law! Why are you worried more about his feelings!
@RealJamesWoods WTF does this have to do with immigration? This is happening on Trumps watch....why don't you ask him!?
@RealCandaceO I agree but what is the difference in allowing a gun that slaughters children and doing nothing about it over and over and over!
@GOPChairwoman You should delete this because you aren't reporting what he meant! Typical
@VP @broomheadshow Most Americans don't want your stupid wall.
@GOPLeader Why don't you read the names of the 1000's of school kids that have been slaughtered by killing machines. This is an actual crisis in your country yet you idiots do nothing to stop it!!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Reminds me of Sandy Hook.....no one did anything about guns. Why is it okay for innocent kids to be slaughtered. A bit hypocritical!
@KatiePavlich I agree this is awful. I also wonder why you don't feel the same about a madman slaughtering innocent children with a gun that shoots multiple bullets in seconds and no one does anything??
@marcorubio Or do nothing about children getting slaughtered in a school!
@funder Why is it taking so long!!??? Hurry up already!
RT @mitchellvii: So, in other words, no matter what happens, it proves global warming?  In order to be scientific, a theory must be provabl…
@mitchellvii Can you imagine how stupid you are to think you're smarter then a scientist? You sound like Trump....thinks he is an expert on everything. What a joke!
@GOP @EricTrump Who gives a crap what Eric Trump thinks...….STFU!!
@realDonaldTrump No wall!!
@PARISDENNARD Do you not think the President is somewhat responsible for this toxic environment. I know you kiss asses don't but his attacks on everyone has created this kind of behavior.
@joshwade1976 @KristySwansonXO It doesn't happen anywhere else in the world like in the US. I wonder why? Could it be that you can get a weapon as easy as candy?
@RyanAFournier White house Petition to impeach Donald Trump reaches 33 billion!!! I can play the game too!
@JackKingston Source? Liar!
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Can't wait for all the lies, fear mongering, bullying, deflecting and wonder if he will blame the Clintons??
@GOP @newtgingrich All 30% of them!
@kayleighmcenany Trump...Mexico will pay for the wall!
@realDonaldTrump Huh? WTF is this?
@charliekirk11 How about not wanting to hear on the news that a gunman has slaughtered many children very quickly with a weapon that shoots multiple bullets very quickly. Call it whatever the hell you want. It is the biggest crisis in your country!
@KristySwansonXO I want to stop turning on the news and hear a gunman killed helpless children with a weapon that shoot multiple bullets very fast. There, how is that! WTF is wrong with not wanting children to get slaughtered?
@JudgeJeanine @realDonaldTrump Bullshit! Do you actually believe this? He only cares about how it will impact him... end of story!
@LindseyGrahamSC Last time I checked you said his decision to cave would end his presidency? Change your mind again?
@RepMarkMeadows As opposed to the honest duffuss we have in charge now?? Maybe a bit hypocritical to go there!
@marklevinshow Of course you think so. Habe u ever criticized him? You aren't credible!
@joncoopertweets @AOL What? Keeping people alive isn't about America? I guess it's true since no one seems to care about guns!
@JudgeJeanine Is Lou some kind of expert on border security?
@TomiLahren @KamalaHarris How can you support the President then??? What a fucking hypocrite! Unreal you would attack her at the same time supporting the biggest slime ball around. You are a joke!
@RepMarkMeadows You don't know that yet.....quit misleading the public!
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi Why the fuck would anyone of the Dem work with this Pres? All he does is attack everyone and then expects unity and bipartisanship? I get that they all should be doing what's best for the country but it seems if he doesn't get his way, he attacks. What an embarrassment to the US
@Liz_Wheeler All on emergency order from our new Dem Pres. See how you like it!
@KristySwansonXO @realDonaldTrump You think this is acceptable behavior from the President of the United States? WTF is wrong with you people. This is an embarrassment to your country! No wonder nothing gets done when these bullying tactics are used. I don't get it!!
@thehill Even if this was true can you imagine a President being so petty to bring this up? He also golfed a hundred times and obviously watch FOX news often.
@GOP Oh look....the GOP is lying again!!
@realDonaldTrump How can any American think this is normal behavior? Too attack a person like this is inexcusable yet Rep stay silent. Wake up America!!
@realDonaldTrump How are those bone spurs treating you liar!
@newtgingrich What would you have done Newt? You would have fought the other party to the death. It is what you did and the reason America is so divided. Go away!
@BuckSexton @TuckerCarlson oh good....lots of fear mongering and lying!
@GOP @kayleighmcenany Of course she does. But Kayleigh has no credibility! All she does is kiss Trumps ass.
@LouDobbs @EdRollins @realDonaldTrump Even if most American don't think it is necessary? That is an abuse of power!
@GOP @PressSec Fix all the gun deaths in your country. That is a crisis far more critical then the border!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Oh look....you're lying again. Do you think people actually believe you? It is unreal how your whole party tries to see this crap!
@benshapiro @WalshFreedom Russian??? Talk about corrupt! Dozens of indictments....talk about corrupt!
@jak55555 @johncardillo 8000++++ lies since taking office!
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump You really want a President using emergency powers because he didn't get his way? And what will you say when a Dem Pres does the same. What happened to you ??
@johncardillo Why isn't Trump for lying daily to America!
@mkraju I thought maybe the break she had would have made her reflect on her honesty.....apparently not!
@WalshFreedom Gun Control for next Dem Pres!!
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @PressSec Why would they show your daughter lie over and over again. You must be so proud. What a joke!
@Harlan What a stupid fucking tweet!
@OutnumberedOT @kayleighmcenany Trump has made your country the laughing stock of the world and put America back 50 years. It will take a long time to recover. Wake up America!!
@OutnumberedOT @BretBaier @kayleighmcenany @surajpatelnyc Sounds like a bunch of lies!
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Didn't you say his presidency was over if he caved??? Guess what....he caved!
@mitchellvii You can't be president from prison.....just sayin
@mitchellvii If you're talking non-Trump supporters....I believe it is closer to 70%
@mschlapp That is all you Rep have. Lie, Deflect, Bully and Blame the Clintons. It's sad!
@mschlapp Trump doesn't know what he wants....he's all over the place. He won't be getting his wall!
@realDonaldTrump Did more to damage the country you mean?
@realDonaldTrump oh look....a lie!
@PARISDENNARD I get the feeling Trump is trying to take the country back 50 years in a lot of ways. Racism, Segregation....what next? Slavery? Oh wait, he has his illegals working for him!
@michaelscherer Did Trump collude with him? This will assure re-election!
@LouDobbs Have you shown the same outrage from the Russian influencing the election? Didn't think so
@realDonaldTrump @johnrobertsFox @GillianHTurner @FoxNews America doesn't want your stupid wall. Check the polls. Speaking of polls, did you see you are in the low 30% now and falling. Good luck!
@LouDobbs @POTUS Spin it anyway you want Lou. Trump is an embarrassment to the country and has taken America back 50 years. This circus will end but it will take years to undo. Wake up America!
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Well she will never lie like Trump and your daughter! Two biggest liars on the planet! You must be so proud?
@shannonrwatts And we have a crisis at the border?? What is wrong with people!
@SarahPalinUSA Lindsey said if Trump caved he presidency would be over. Lindsey has no credibility anymore.
@KristySwansonXO A Trump supporter should never complain about someone else lying. He literally lies constantly!
@Liz_Wheeler How about no more children slaughtered by automatic rifles?? You seem to be okay with that? That is the crisis in America!
@Liz_Wheeler Trump won't be running. The walls are caving in. Having said that I believe sadly Clinton is the only that could compete with Trump. There is nobody else that is appealing to Dems.
@GOPLeader Why would anyone want to watch Trump stand there and lie for two hours. Its embarrassing to the country!
@realJeffreyLord @DailyCaller His arrests raise a lot of questions about whether Rep care about the country! Rep are more worried about how he was arrested instead of the crime. WTF is wrong with you people!
@marklevinshow Lots of lies I expect!
@JudgeJeanine Of course you feel the same about Trump? No one has ever lied more then him but as usual deflect, bully and blame the Clintons! You are a joke!
@GeraldoRivera It is revealing that Rep are more worried about how a criminal is apprehended instead of the crime!
@realDonaldTrump And you like to lie so who knows if it is true!
@RyanAFournier And yet Rep say nothing about Russians allowing trump to steal the election!
@kylegriffin1 Trump doesn't want to fix the problem that way. It won't allow to make the case that it is a crisis.
@RealJamesWoods But you're okay with the Russian influencing the election? What is wrong with you people!
@TomiLahren We don't need a wall! Guns cause more American deaths by far. Get your priorities straight! Wake up America!
@shannoncoulter I fear Hillary is the only way to beat Trump
@mitchellvii It will be tied up in court. Then the next Dem pres (2020) does the same for gun control.
@chuckwoolery Are you kidding me??? Everything Trump does is for himself. He doesn't give a shit about Americans....he cares about making himself look good and polls. I cannot believe a sane human doesn't see that!
@mgroppe @purduemitch Especially now with the way Trump lies.
@Hbobrow1Hbobrow But sadly I think she is the only one that can beat Trump. I wish this wasn't the case but we need Trump out and Clinton will beat him this time.
@GeraldoRivera @ChrisBuryNews Maybe Trump shouldn't be so hypocritical in the first place and none of it would have happened. How can you defend this at all??
@LisaMarieBoothe @ABC The majority of American don't think the wall is necessary. Spin it anyway you want….he will never get the funding unless Mexico pays. Pelosi will never cave like Trump did.
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump If there is a shutdown it needs to always to debated separately. They should never use peoples lives as a political pawn. Either side.
@GeraldoRivera @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Trump has to understand he is never getting his stupid wall. Americans don't think it is necessary. She will never lose on that.
@mitchellvii @SpeakerPelosi Wrong! He is not getting his wall unless Mexico pays or he declares state of emergency. If the latter he will lose more support not only from his base but his own party. He is lost right now
@GOP @KellyannePolls This is a lìe
@realDonaldTrump You're the Witch!
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump How about he is never going to get a nickel for the wall!
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Another lie.....What about Russian interference? Shouldn't you care about that?
@realDonaldTrump I assume this is a lie since 99.9% of what you tweet is dishonest. Why can't you unite the country instead of fear mongering, bullying, lying and blaming the Clintons! Wake up America!!
@SenTedCruz Liar! Do you think anyone believes this crap. Trump said he owned just like he said Mexico would pay for the wall. Why do Rep keep lying. Americans see right through it. Do your job, unite the country and stop fucking lying!!
@mitchellvii Huh???
@joncoopertweets The sad thing is that I am excited for this. America has become a sad joke. The Trump name will have a bad ending but this whole story is a black eye on America. Wake up!!
@Xyrdrai @JudgeJeanine @FLOTUS They do lie or even make mistakes but FOX lies constantly and no one lies more then the Pres and Sanders!
@Xyrdrai @JudgeJeanine @FLOTUS Are you kidding me? No one lies more then the President. How can you defend that? It is a fact that he has lied over 8000++++ times in two years. What is wrong with you people!!
@RyanAFournier Careful...trump has some skeletons in his closet!
@JudgeJeanine @FLOTUS Who cares!!
@CaidenCowger @DavidLimbaugh Because most human aren't about screwing the little guy. Most humans aren't living their dream. Most humans struggle every day and you idiots think that because you have money you know how that feels. MSM speaks to the people.
@JudgeJeanine Are you fucking kidding me??? Trump is the biggest liar on the planet. 8000++++ lies in his first two years. WTF are you talking about! This is why you have no credibility. Unreal!
@JudgeJeanine He is an embarrassment to the country. He will never get the wall. Wake up America!
@kylegriffin1 Why doesn't trump get all the undocumented "illegals" he hires to run his business to build the wall......that would be ironic!
@JudgeJeanine @GovMikeHuckabee Two big liars!
@realDonaldTrump Liar!
@realDonaldTrump No one believes you anymore you liar. Now in the low 30's in approval. 20's won't be far off.
@larryelder You've ruined it for two years so no thanks....let sane people take over!
@TaxReformExpert @SpeakerPelosi Go ahead...this will doom him and when the Dem president takes over in 2020 he/she will declare an emergency for gun control. A much bigger crisis in the country!
@SarahPalinUSA Who wants to listen to Trump lie for 2 hours anyway! I like the decision.
@JudgeJeanine Well at least you're not lying!
@DavidLimbaugh Trumps wall is a waste of money and most Americans believe that....second, Trump is an idiot and he said he would own the shutdown. Do you not get that??? It's quite simple and he will never get his wall. Unless he gets a cheque from Mexico in the next 21 days!
@chuckwoolery Don't you think this is not what American should be concerned about? The guy is a criminal (allegedly). Shouldn't that be what we are concerned about??
@GOP @realDonaldTrump It wasn't the first two years of Trumps presidency.....why is it now? Liars!!
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I can't believe any sane person doesn't connect the dots! Trump has lied and cheated all his life. Even you have to admit that GR. Come on!
@johncardillo What about the President??
@johncardillo @SpeakerPelosi And you call out the Pres for lying?? Don't be a hypocrite! No one lies more then Trump. The walls are closing in and all you idiots will look like fools!
@GovMikeHuckabee @TBN @JudgeJeanine @FoxNews Lots of lying I expect!!
@GovMikeHuckabee Shouldn't you be more upset about someone committing crimes against the US? I don't get you idiots who blame the Clintons and CNN for everything! It's America!!
@StephGrisham45 @FLOTUS @ninaburleigh Who cares!!
@GovMikeHuckabee I see where your daughter gets it! Liar!!
@realDonaldTrump You are the biggest liar on the planet!!?? We do want the truth!
@BillKristol Because they all knew the wall was a waste of money and Trump had said Mexico would pay. The whole thing is not only an embarrassment to Rep but the whole country. 5 more murders in Louisiana to gun violence today. Focus on your real crisis!!
@BuckSexton Then why didn't he push for the wall for the first two years? All of the sudden it is a crisis. What about 5 people being killed by guns today in Louisiana? Isn't that a crisis? What is wrong with you people!
@BuckSexton @nickgillespie @KennedyNation Teenage Head!
@seanmdav Proof? Source?
@realDonaldTrump Hope you get that cheque from Mexico soon!
@thehill @TheHillOpinion What, a pattern of arresting criminals??
@TomiLahren Another 5 people killed by a gunman in Louisiana. Why don't you idiots focus on a real crisis?? You don't give a shit about American dying!
@TomiLahren No wall ever!!
@mschlapp Oh look....back to back lies. Of course they don't want anyone coming into the country. Trump will not get his stupid wall.
@GOP @KellyannePolls 90% does not come through the Southern border. This is a lie. But normal for these idiots!
@charliekirk11 Lies...half of this is bullshit.  But that is the rep way. Lie, blame, deflect and blame the Clintons!
@chuckwoolery Who wants to hear nothing but bullshit lies?
@DavidLimbaugh Do you actually believe this bullshit??
@SarahPalinUSA How about Mexico pay? Oh wait, that was a lie. He is not getting his stupid wall!
@realDonaldTrump You had 2 years to deal with this "crisis" and didn't.  You will never get your wall unless you get a cheque from Mexico in the next 21 days!
@LindseyGrahamSC No wall. Fix the border but he will never get his wall. Unless he gets Mexico to pay.
@GeraldoRivera @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi Shutting down the gov't should always be handled desperately and never used politically. No one wins
@EdKrassen Who cares!
@RyanAFournier Who cares!
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Spin it all you want. Trump owned it and caved.
@RealJamesWoods Once again....when in trouble blame the Clintons. It's unreal how obsessed you idiots are with them. How sad!
@BuckSexton What about Russian fraud? It allowed Trump to become Pres. And no of you idiots care. Brutal!
@realDonaldTrump No wall! You will lose to Pelosi again.
@renato_mariotti I can't believe this idiot would go on FOX and defend himself. How did his lawyers allow this?
@realDonaldTrump Who cares what Matt says. Why do you quote these ass kissers. Do you think people believe this crap? You're not getting your stupid wall. BTW did you see that 30ish% approval rating?? Can't wait until it is in the 20's!
@SRuhle @realDonaldTrump Pelosi need to keep saying no. He will use his "emergency" executive order and that will be his downfall. No wall!!
@BrentHBaker @billmaher He's a comedian! You don't have to like his material but that's what comedians do.....make fun of people and situations. Relax
@realDonaldTrump You're lying again.....no proof. These people have been investigated.
@chuckwoolery Because they don't. An speaking of lying.....do you ever call out the Pres or Sanders? Didn't think so
@dcexaminer Pssst Tucker....he is a liar!
@IngrahamAngle Haven't you wondered??
@seanhannity @jerome_corsi @newtgingrich @AlanDersh @HeyTammyBruce @seanspicer @GreggJarrett @jasoninthehouse Lies, Lies, Lies, Lies, and blame the Clintons!!
@seanhannity Your not getting your stupid wall Hannity. Pelosi schooled little Donny!
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump Be careful what you threaten Sarah....next Pres will do the same with Gun control if you want to play that game. It is by far a bigger crisis!
@PARISDENNARD @realDonaldTrump There is no emergency at the border. He will never get his stupid wall!
@thehill He will have to declare and emergency to get a nickel. This will also open the door for the next Pres.(2020) to do the same for gun control. Good luck!
@chuckwoolery I'm surprised the Rep have increased the deficit 2 trillion dollars in two years!
@Jim_Jordan @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer Ur not getting your stupid wall! Nancy says so!!
@RealJamesWoods This is such bullshit. Why do you spew this crap?? You've joined the Trump/FOX lying crew! STFU
@GOPChairwoman @GOP @realDonaldTrump No wall!
@JudgeJeanine @POTUS What, cave and get nothing? He knocked it out of the park!
@JohnCornyn Russian rigged the election....this should be everyone's most important issue
@RepMattGaetz @SpeakerPelosi She will but there will be no Wall!
@codeofvets Do you not find it odd that so many in Trumps circle are going to  jail? Does to me!
@DiamondandSilk Wrong....they put forward 11 proposals that were almost exactly what Trump accepted. Spin it anyway you want....today was a horrible day for Trump. Many more to come I suspect! Pelosi owns him!
@RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump That is why you have no credibility.
@RepMattGaetz It's on Tucker so its Fake News!!
@MAGAindex He isn't getting his stupid wall!!
@IngrahamAngle @FBI omg you are brutal....lie, deflect, and blame the Clintons......that is all you idiots have!
@chuckwoolery Spin it all you want Chuck....he lost to Pelosi bad. If he manages to remain out of prison, today will be the day he lost 2020
@JudgeJeanine @realDonaldTrump He folded.....no wall #. Spin it all you want.....he looked embarrassed!
@PARISDENNARD @GOPChairwoman @GOP @realDonaldTrump You forgot liar. She fits right in with Trump and Sanders!
@DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump I see no mention of another Trump official being arrested. Apparently you are okay law breakers!?
@RealJamesWoods Trump can own gun violence. Much bigger problem!
@BillOReilly WTF, he caved! Political loss today for Trump!
@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump He caved! You must be so proud. I can't wait to see how you spin this....
@JRubinBlogger Can you imagine the lies that he will tell??
@BuckSexton @EWErickson Previous tweets indicate you are saying he is wrong! Hypocrite
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Oh lucky you....you get to lie for two more years!
@ShannonBream @realDonaldTrump I suspect he will lie!
@RealJamesWoods No mention that him breaking the law is a problem for you??? Who gives a shit how they brought him in.....he broke the law!
@realDonaldTrump Yes there was collusion. You stole the election!
@SarahPalinUSA Some might wonder if you have proof!
@BuckSexton @michellechel Didn't you send out a 1000 tweets about how unfair the media was to the Covinton gang? And now you are attacking CNN without any proof. What a fucking hypocrite!
@greta How do you know this. All the attacks on fake news and you send this out??
@NewDay @PressSec And lie!
@RealJamesWoods It doesn't out weigh the fact that Russians influenced the election. How can that sit well with You?
@GOP @kayleighmcenany Wrong. Spin it anyway you want. The Pres. Owns it and it will be his legacy if he doesn't open the gov't soon.
@SaraCarterDC But your okay with Russia potentially influences an election? That is what you should be worried about! Wtf is wrong with you people!
@IngrahamAngle @CNN Why don't you mind ur own business and worry about your Jerry Springer network FOX!
@realDonaldTrump Congrats! Now open the fucking gov't you criminal!
@mkraju @MarshallCohen That's some witch hunt!
@mkraju Whatever side you are on you should want our elections to be honest. I suspect there are many country's that don't have an honest democratic process to hear the people but America should. Who know how long this kind of thing has been going on? But it needs to be fixed!
@BuckSexton Bullshit.....what if it was the Clintons?? You would be jumping up and down watching FOX. Beside, maybe he shouldn't have broken the law!
@senatemajldr Good, I am glad you agree. Open the gov't!
@realDonaldTrump Liar. Most people believe them because of tweets like this. Bully, blame and lie!
@GOP @realDonaldTrump This is a lie and fear mongering!
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump Go ahead and when a Dem wins in 2020 we will expect he/she will do the same for automatic weapons! More of a crisis anyway!
@TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump Or him fumble through the prompter....talk about how great he is! Owe and lie, deflect, bully and blame the Clintons! Wake up America!
@GOP @SecPompeo America is a laughing stock around the world right now. Wake up America!
@DineshDSouza Do you actually believe this bullshit? Spin any way you want.....Trump owns this and it will be his embarrassing legacy if he doesn't cave soon! Good luck!
@realDonaldTrump You know the stock market doesn't mean you are capable of doing your job. You have failed at most parts and the 34% approval must be driving you mad! Wait, you were already there!
@AdamBaldwin @realDonaldTrump Does that include 800k he isn't paying. STFU you idiot!
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends 800k aren't getting paid!! Your approval rating is 34%. Good luck jackass!
@SaraCarterDC Pelosi is saving the country! Wake up America or 30% anyway!
@GOP The crisis is the gun violence in your country. Not the made up one! Wake up America!!
@RealJamesWoods Haven't we been through this once already.....get a life!!
@thehill Too late....do it when you are in! Cowards!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Your old man has lied 8000++++ and you attack the media for a few mistakes. Go away! Wake up America....this is all bullshit!
@KimStrassel @LeeSmithDC @WSJopinion Typical Rep....lie, deflect, bully and blame the Obama's and Clinton's. STFU!
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Ya, and how is that working out for you? 800k not being paid, laughing stock of the world.....lies, lies, lies! What a joke! Wake up America!!
@MrDane1982 Trump is the fucking enemy!!
@joshtpm America, what have you done??? How can anyone support this behavior? It never ends. Your country is the laughing stock of the world!
@philsoussan Did you know there is more to being President then creating jobs? That is important but it is also nice to lead with respect, tell the truth, not bully, not blame the Clintons for everything and unite the country. Trump has failed at all!
@DavidAFrench You mean like Trump with bone spurs??
@chuckwoolery and keeping their kids in cages???
@TomiLahren I wouldn't because someone might shoot the place up. Guns are the crisis in your country! Not the made up border crisis. Wake up America!!
@Evan_Rosenfeld What is wrong with America that they voted for this behavior. Unreal!!
@puresilk55 @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi I'm glad you're happy with your economy. Unfortunately there is more to being President then the economy. He needs to lead, unite, and have respect around the world. Trump lies, blames, bullies and blames the Clintons. 800k aren't feeling good about the economy!
@seanhannity Which is odd because 800k are out of work thanks to trump
@JudgeJeanine This is why you are never taken serious. Jerry Springer want to be!
@RyanAFournier And now you are doing the same!
@chuckwoolery Hey Chuck, Did you see 5 people were killed in Florida by gun violence yesterday and you are tweeting this bullshit. Wake up America!!
@realJeffreyLord @LeeSmithDC @WSJopinion Why is that you idiots can't stop blaming Obama and the Clintons for everything. The gov't is shutdown, another mass shooting in Florida (a real crisis) and a made up border crisis that didn't seem to be a priority for the first two years. Wake up America!
@kayleighmcenany @AmericaNewsroom @FoxNews @SandraSmithFox @BillHemmer Spin it anyway you want. Trump and the Rep own this and it will be his legacy if it goes on much longer. Open the gov't and quit the political games!
@LindseyGrahamSC @SpeakerPelosi Bullshit. He isn't taking the high road. It's a game to him and he will do anything to embarrass anyone who crosses him. It's not over....just wait. In the meantime....open the gov't!
@RepDanCrenshaw Open the gov't if actions speak louder then words! Spin it anyway you want....Rep own this!
@VP @trish_regan @POTUS 5 more dead from gun violence in Florida yesterday. Focus on a real crisis and stop fear mongering. Why is the border a crisis now and it wasn't the first two years you idiots were in charge? Open the gov't!!!
@davidharsanyi What is your explanation for kids being slaughtered with an automatic rifle and nothing being done to prevent it in the future?
@realDonaldTrump Did you see 5 Americans were killed by gun violence in Florida. Why don't you focus on a real crisis instead of a made up one!!
@realDonaldTrump Open the gov't! That will be your legacy if it goes much longer. 32% approval rating now.....you must be proud but the fake president doesn't report on that!
@BillOReilly spin it anyway you want. Trump created this mess. The buck stops with him and the gov't shutdown. He can get it open in an instant. Why was the border not a top priority the first two year but all of the sudden a major crisis? Could it be Trump was not looking to solve a problem
@marcorubio Trump probably doesn't even know what this means??
@GOPChairwoman Mind your own business! Get the gov't open!
@JackKingston @realDonaldTrump Takes the high road? Are kidding me? This is a game to Trump....he is planning his next embarrassing move which will make your country more of a joke then it already is. Wake up America!
@realDonaldTrump Hey how about that approval rating? Dipping into the low 30's which is right around where Nixon was. What a coincidence! Good luck!
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi Do you actually think that was his reason?? Not likely, it is a game to him and he is planning his next move to bully and embarrass Pelosi. The whole thing is an embarrassment to the US. Your country is a joke right now and 800k people are without paychecks! WTF
@MSNBC @AriMelber Wow, that's a lot of liars....Trump should be on the end!
@DavidCornDC OPEN THE GOV'T!!
@guypbenson Spin it anyway you want. American blame Trump and this will be his legacy if it carries on much longer. Good luck!
@RealJamesWoods Welcome him to lie, deflect, bully, and then blame the Clintons!
@NewDay @CNNValencia This is barely on Twitter. Gun violence is now the norm and not covered the same due to all the chaos Trump has created. Very sad!
@realDonaldTrump It will be all lies anyway so save it!
@mikandynothem @realDonaldTrump @GrizzMaestro @DineshDSouza @codeofvets @DonnaWR8 @JohnKStahlUSA @KatTheHammer1 @chuckwoolery @LeahR77 @DiamondandSilk Why, he will just lie, blame, deflect and bully. What a joke! You're country is a laughing stock!
@realJeffreyLord No Rep should talk about lying! Trump and Sanders lie constantly and have caused the American people to lose confidence. 30ish% approval. Wake up America!
@AOC Sean Hannity is a Jerry Springer want to be. Sad thing is Trump loves reality tv!
@JoyAnnReid Sadly this is hardly on twitter tonight with all the bullshit Trump has created. America needs to wake up and start preventing these!!
@RepDanCrenshaw Open the gov't and pay them all what they deserve. Trump owns the shutdown...he said so! Spin it anyway you want....Rep can fix it but won't
@FrankLuntz 32% support Trump!
@realannapaulina But is suppose you're okay with kids getting slaughter with an AR15? WTF is wrong with people!
@GOP @KellyannePolls Open the gov't ….then ask!
@PARISDENNARD @realDonaldTrump Why doesn't trump open the gov't! He owns it....spin it anyway you want!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Spin it any way you want....Daddy owns the shutdown! His approval rating is diving and this will end up being his legacy. Wake up America!
@Jim_Jordan @SpeakerPelosi Spin it anyway you want. Trump owns the shutdown and it will be his legacy if it last much longer. His approval rating is falling fast. Open the gov't! Wake up America!
@kayleighmcenany End the gov't shutdown. Did you see Trumps approval rating is lowest it has ever been and just above Nixon's lowest. Wake up America!
@JackKingston The crisis is Trump and guns. Yes he should address both!
@chuckwoolery Levin is an idiot and a bully. He has no credibility. She shouldn't waste her time!
@realDonaldTrump How about you focus on a real crisis in your country. Another 5 dead in Florida from gun violence. Wake up America! Don't give me your thoughts and prayers!
@chuckwoolery Like Trump being President?? Lying, blaming bullying his way through life and he becomes President......doesn't make sense. America should be ashamed!
@RepDanCrenshaw Spin it anyway you want. Trump owns this mess and he will pay the price for it.
@senatemajldr Fix your damn gun laws! Another 5 dead today and you idiots are fighting over a stupid fence! WTF is wrong with you people. It is disgraceful!
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Does it give a date in the Constitution? No....open the gov't and then go ahead and lie to the American people all you want.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Then open the fucking gov't !!
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Bullshit.....Trump shouldn't be able to address the American people until he opens the gov't. You would say the same if it was a Dem President. Besides, Trump will just lie, blame, bully and deflect....who wants to listen to that!
@BretBaier @realDonaldTrump Who wants to see the lies, deflection, blame and bullying!? Waste of time!
@realDonaldTrump Your approval rating is at an all time low. Just 2% higher then Nixon. That's kind of a coincidence don't you think??
@RogerMarshallMD @realDonaldTrump Spin it anyway you want....Trump owns it. He has made his own bed with his lies, blame, deflection and bullying. Now he is getting push back and he has no answer. Wake up America.....open the gov't!!
@LisaMarieBoothe Who wants to listen to the lies, deflection, blame and bullying anyway!!
@jeneps @ToluseO He will do it from the border I bet. It will be full of lies and fear mongering. Can't wait!
@ThePlumLineGS It's called leadership!
@JudgeJeanine Come on! The President owns this and even said so. He has lied, deflected, blamed and bullied his way through the first two years. Now he has a foe and he is lost. He will be blamed and rightly so.
@realDonaldTrump You are actually President of the United States?? What the hell is wrong with your country!
@Liz_Wheeler Of course you don't. Have you ever agreed with anyone but Trump. Spin it all you want. Trump owns this mess and created it with his immature bully tactics. Lie, Divert, blame the Clintons and lie again. Open the gov't!!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Lady's and Gentleman....this idiot is a parent!
@chuckwoolery Trump is willing to talk if he gets his way. In business that may have worked for him but not in Politics. He made his bed and he now owns the whole shit sandwich!!
@GOPLeader Why? It will just be a bunch of lies!
@WhiteHouse @CBP Fear mongering!!
@seanhannity @AlanDersh @jsolomonReports Clinton, Clinton, Clinton.....wtf is wrong with you....move on!
@realDonaldTrump 8000+++++ lies. Shameful!
@DonaldJTrumpJr You are an idiot!
@DonaldJTrumpJr As opposed to the Russians?
@seanhannity Who cares! It would just be a big lie  fest!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Your country is a joke! How can anyone think this is presidential behaviour.  Brutal!
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Who cares. All Trump will do is lie anyway!
@newtgingrich This is something you would habe done Newt! The king of dividing the country!!!
@RyanAFournier Oh don't worry....lots of crime to go around....100's of deaths everyday from gun violence! Why don't they fix the real crisis!!
@PARISDENNARD @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Spin it anyway you want. Trump owns it and will be held responsible. He can open the gov't right now....he chooses not too!
@PARISDENNARD @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer How about Trump leads the country for all Americans. He owns this mess and you can spin it anyway you want. This will be his legacy!
@RyanAFournier Wrong. Trump is losing. Spin it anyway you want...he owns the problem and will pay the price!
@marklevinshow You have no credibility! What a joke
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Bullshit! The Rep are cracking. Another lie
@realDonaldTrump What about unity in America?? You work for all of America....not 30% of the insane people! Open the gov't and lead the country. You can spin it anyway you want.....you own this and it will be your legacy!
@realDonaldTrump Hey, How about that approval rating taking a dive?? What an embarrassment that must be for you?
@Liz_Wheeler Facts say less school shooting will occur if automatic assault rifles are banned!
@GOP @PressSec Sanders and the President are to blame for all of this mess! If they would tell the truth once in a while they may get some respect. Instead all they do is lie, deflect, blame and bully. Did I mention lie?? The American people deserve better then this. Trump owns this mess!
@seanhannity What a joke. It will be all lies and fear mongering. Waste of breath!!
@VABVOX Who the fuck cares what she thinks anyways? Why is she even speaking!
@IngrahamAngle Mitch is a fucking coward if this is the route he is taking. But he has shown time and time again he doesn't care about laws or the American people. It is all about re-election. Sounds a lot like Trump I know!
@BillOReilly And who is to blame for that??? Trump! He lies, deflects, blames, bullies and then blames the Clintons. Did I mention all the lies? How anyone think his behavior is normal is beyond me. He created this mess!!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Day 31 of Trumps decision to close the gov't. He owns and spin it anyway you like, the buck stops with him! He can open it and won't!
@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Wrong.....he owns it all and has said so. He blamed Obama for shutdowns and said at the end of the day the buck stops with the President. Open the fucking gov't!!
@realDonaldTrump GUN CONTROL AND AMRICAN LIVES WILL BE SAVED! INCLUDING CHILDREN!!!
@marklevinshow Yes, and let's see Trumps taxes also. I know you have been screaming for them?? Hypocrite!
@realDonaldTrump Why don't you quit complaining and do your job and open the gov't. It is disgraceful you have time to whine and snivel on twitter about how people are mean to you but you attack, lie, deflect and blame the Clintons. It is unreal America accepts your behavior!
@RealDrGina @AOC I bet Trump doesn't either. Actually maybe he does....he probably dodge the draft!
@RealDrGina @SpeakerPelosi Everyday since Trump was elected!
@newtgingrich @realDonaldTrump This is exactly how you worked when you were speaker. It all started with you Newt! Don't be a hypocrite.....go away!
@seanhannity Do you have a list of the 8000++++ lies Trump has told?? I guess you are okay with your leaders crazy behavior?? What a joke!
@alexanderbruz @realDonaldTrump When they find there was collusion will you just blame the Clintons? Probably and that is sad!
@PARISDENNARD @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Your country is the laughing stock of the world right now. Spin it anyway you want…..Trump is ruining your once great nation. Wake up America!
@GOPChairwoman Even if this is true (which I doubt) this is just fear mongering. 100's of Americans die every day form guns. Why don't you focus on a real crisis!!
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump GR, I find it hard to believe that there aren't some skeletons in Trumps closet. All he does is lie over and over and I suspect this has been his character all his life. Something is going to take him down. Anyone who denies this needs their head examined!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Because all he will do is lie to the American people! He can't tell the truth. Fear mongering, deflection, denial and blame the Clintons. That is the Rep strategy!
@realDonaldTrump What a joke! That is her job.....if she didn't lie so much she wouldn't get such tough questions. She goes out there and has to make shit up because of your lies! WTF is wrong with your country!
@DiamondandSilk @LouDobbs @Alyssa_Milano This is the stupidest tweet I have ever seen. Stfu!
@Newsweek Bad choices sometimes create bad outcomes!
@BillOReilly Sexual predators stand together Bill?
@RealSaavedra @CNNPR If trump had to delete all his lies his profile would be empty!!
@AnnCoulter To have Mexico pay!!???
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Oh well if Fox says so it must be true! You are the one playing politics and it will leave a huge black mark on your Presidency. You are the leader and you are acting like a spoiled imp. Open the gov't!!
@RyanAFournier Source? Lying again I see!
@Zrmcb4 @chuckwoolery And Trump position isn't about votes? He knows if he doesn't get his wall he is doomed. The majority of Americans don't think the wall is necessary and remember Mexico was paying for it?? But intelligent people knew that wouldn't happen!
@BuckSexton Are you telling me that kid was not disrespecting the native leader at all while his buddies egged him on? Would you be proud if that was your son?
@realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson Why did you tweet this? Be Presidential and instead of a slime ball! WTF is wrong with you!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Do you really think DT didn't create this environment?? Sorry but he is the # one reason the country is so divided and all this hatred! He has the power to lead and unite the country but he won't. He is too fucking selfish and doesn't actually care. This is a big game show to him
@GOP @kayleighmcenany KM has no credibility. She is so one-sided and never criticizes anything Trump does. Although now that I think of it.....neither does anyone in his party! America is a joke right now!
@RyanAFournier Same reason you are.....skewing bullshit!
@LisaMarieBoothe @NYDailyNews You think this is appropriate Lisa?
@realDonaldTrump Fear mongering and probably a lie! Presidents don't do this!
@KatrinaPierson Trump supporters obviously don't have brains!
@larryelder Not today Larry....this is classless!
@JackKingston @RepThomasMassie @RepBradWenstrup @WarrenDavidson I have seen all the videos and those boys behavior still was offensive.
@realDonaldTrump Open the gov't! Lead the country not just 30%. Time to start unifying the country!
@RyanAFournier Trump is the biggest liar on the planet.....fact check him!
@LindseyGrahamSC Sadly your country seems to have gone backwards 50 years to this time. You have a chance to stop this LG! Grow a backbone!
@realJeffreyLord @samgwells @BreitbartNews Are you kidding me? When has there been any example of Trump treating all Americans as equals? Because an African American got a job? Brutal!
@realJeffreyLord @BreitbartNews Less then 2 minutes.....how exhausting!
@kayleighmcenany And the country has never been so divided due to your parties leader and the cowards that won't stand up to him. America is a joke right now and it will take years to repair all the damage Trump has done!
@Jim_Jordan Trump is President. If he was interested in helping the country he would open the gov't. He is the leader and should work on uniting the country.....not ripping it apart. Spin it anyway you like.....Trump owns it all!
@RealDrGina @realDonaldTrump @DanScavino You mean Liar of a Man!?
@DonaldJTrumpJr Your old man is the biggest bully on the planet.....except face to face!
@VP You must be exhausted after that 2 minute celebration! What a joke!!
@thehill Um, I believe your boss may be a bit of a serial liar!
@seanhannity Are you kidding me. Who cares what Rudy says....he lies almost as much as Trump. What a joke!
@RyanAFournier Source? Fucking liar!
@realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow What if he was a Dem?? This is such bullshit. Stay out of this shit!
@GOP @VP 30% want action. 70% want the Gov't open. Do you job and look after the American people like you said you would. You need to unit the country and stop lying!
@marklevinshow Why because he is a Republican? If he wasn't you wouldn't agree!
@JackKingston @MZHemingway @McAllisterDen And you have never ever criticized anything Trump has done. All the lies, deflection, blame and you never have once said anything negative. What a joke.....you think America is that stupid??
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Two years of ruining the country and making 30% of the citizens happy. How is that leading? The country has never been so divided! Wake up America!
@chuckwoolery That's because they knew it was a bullshit deal! Offering back what he took away on Dreamers is not a concession.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Not wrong! The country has been taken back 50 years by that racist asshole! Wake up America!
@KyleKashuv Spin it anyway you want....that kid was being disrespectful and the kids around him are encouraging the behavior.
@PressSec Your country was better. It has now gone back 50 years again thanks to Trumps policies and acceptance of hate and division. Your administration is a joke and an embarrassment to the world!
@JohnCornyn @CBP @DHSgov @rgv3307 Oh well if you spoke to officers today....why didn't you say so? Most Americans would rather have food on their table that a stupid wall! Open the gov't!
@SenToomey Open the gov't!
@larryelder Are you fucking kidding me! Other then guns, racism is the biggest problem with your country. Segregation still exists and now with this insane President, the country has gone 50 years backwards when racism was alive and well. WTF is wrong with you !
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @POTUS But it's a lie. He doesn't care....he is just feeding more bullshit out there to entice his base. He has never had this position before running for Pres. What a joke!
@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump @AmericaNewsroom @FoxNews @SandraSmithFox @EricShawnTV He's the President of all Americans. He owns all of this and has said so multiple times. The buck stops with him. Open the gov't and quit using peoples lives you claim to care about. He doesn't give a shit about anyone but himself. Your country is an embarrassment!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Huh?? This is another lie! He has set back the country 50 years! What a joke!
@FLOTUS Ya how??
@EWErickson It's time for trump to lead. Open the gov't and look after the American people. He is the one that can fix this but he continually acts like this is a business and it is his way or the highway. That doesn't work in politics. He needs to unit the country!
@PARISDENNARD @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse The only thing Trump has done that relates to MLK is he has taken America back 50 years to a horrible time of division. How can anyone think this is good for the country?
@OliverMcGee @POTUS @FLOTUS @VP @SecondLady @realDonaldTrump @MELANIATRUMP @WhiteHouse Who knew what a disaster the next two years would be. Embarrassing for the country!
@PARISDENNARD @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse What a joke. Why isn't he out celebrating MLK. How do you accept this behavior? I don't get it!
@GOPChairwoman How is Trump celebrating MLK? Never mind I know how he feels about non-whites!
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump Yet you are the laughing stock of the world. Open your gov't and lead! Your country has never looked weaker!
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump They will negotiate when he opens the gov't. Why is he not doing the right thing for American that aren't getting a paycheck. At some point he needs to be a leader and not a spoiled brat! He can fix this.....he chooses not too. Spin it anyway you want!
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer Why can't he just open the gov't??
@GovMikeHuckabee What about kids being slaughtered in schools? You're okay with that?
@BuckSexton @EWErickson Give it a rest....WTF!
@ChrisRBarron The President can't go 15 minutes without a lie!
@BuckSexton Did you comment on the thousands of lies Trump has up? Didn't think so!
@BuckSexton How many fucking tweets are you going to post on this??? STFU already.
@larryelder @realDonaldTrump This doesn't mean shit! WTF is wrong with you?
@GOP @VP What a joke. He offered exactly what he already took away with DACA. The fucking lies, and deceit are incredible. How anyone buys this crap is beyond me!
@MarkYoungTruth @SpeakerPelosi The 800k people out of work should win! What is wrong with your country. What a fucking embarrassment!
@BorisEP @realDonaldTrump Your once great country is now a joke! Both sides aren't doing their job and world is laughing at you. Trump needs to somehow unite the country but he can't help himself. It is really sad watching 800k suffer because of egos!
@WalshFreedom Gun control!
@realDonaldTrump Until he pisses you off and then you will attack him and try to embarrass him. It's a pattern with you in case anyone didn't notice.
@GOP @RepLizCheney This is reality tv to Trump. He doesn't give a shit about 800k people not making mortgage payments. He is just about himself and 2020. Wake up America.....he is ruining the country and is an embarrassment all over the world!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Do you just send out the same tweet over and over and hope people will eventually believe your bullshit? What a joke!
@thehill Why was this not a crisis the first two years? Mexico is paying I think I heard somewhere?
@GOP @realDonaldTrump What a joke! Your country is the laughing stock of the world. Trump has divided the country more then ever and lied his way through two years. Embarrassing!
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump All he offered on DACA was what he already took away. Why is that reasonable? Nice try. You guys own it!! Open the gov't.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Well 30% of the people
@GOP @GOPChairwoman And has failed! The country is more divided then ever and is an embarrassment all over the world!
@TomiLahren Um who increased the deficit 2 trillion dollars??
@JackKingston Same with the gun debate Jack. Politics and NRA funding!
@marcorubio @POTUS All he offered on the Dreamers is what he already took away. How is that reasonable? Open the fucking gov't!
@PARISDENNARD @realDonaldTrump @VP @FLOTUS Your country is a laughing stock all over the world. Yet you idiot applaud his insane behavior. What a joke!
@RyanAFournier Don't forget the four dead soldiers in Syria he is responsible for because of a knee jerk decision and not listening to his experts.
@realDonaldTrump Liar!
@JackKingston Spin away Jack. Trump owns the shutdown. Open the gov't!
@RepMarkMeadows And waste tax payer money! People are dying all over your country through gun violence. Get your priorities straight.
@JackKingston Trump isn't compromising! Its his way or the highway! He is finding out in business that may work but in politics you need to lead, unite and work for all Americans. Not the 30% of insane people that support him!
@realDonaldTrump It's also about leading your country and working for all Americans. Not the 30% who somehow support your insane behaviour!
@larryelder @realDonaldTrump I bet he was still a liar!
@OliverMcGee @BuzzFeed @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Trump is a liar. That is obvious. He is a FAKE PRES!
@kayleighmcenany What a joke. His offer on DACA is what he took away? What kind of deal is that. You have no credibility!
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Open the gov't and stop lying!
@Hunter14Troy @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer Wrong! Trump owns it and said so. America knows this. What he offered with DACA is what he already took away. He is ruining your country. Wake up!
@JudgeJeanine @charliekirk11 You can spin it anyway you want. Trump will lose this battle and he owns the shutdown. He is making America a joke. Wake the fuck up!
@Cernovich Don't give me this shit! Both sides get harassed! It's America and everyone thinks they are god. Your country is a joke right now and Trump has created it. He is not representing the country....only 30% of the population that are insane to support him!
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Trump created a lot of the problem by lying. He has made it impossible for the left to take him serious. He bully's which may have worked in the business world but is not as effective in politics. He's is ruining your once great country!
@brithume His offer on DACA is exactly what he already took away! It's a joke. Offer citizenship for his stupid wall! Open the gov't and quit ruining your once great country!
@Hunter14Troy @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer Why the fuck doesn't he open the gov't?? He owns it!
@ArthurSchwartz @IngrahamAngle @BuzzFeedNews Who cares what JR has to say. What a waste of time!
@senatemajldr @POTUS Bold solution?? All he did was offer back what he already took with Dreamers. What a joke. Try again! You people are a mess!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump All he offered with DACA is what he already took away. What a fucking joke. Nice try but American aren't that stupid!
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer All he is offering on DACA is what he took away originally. Why would anyone agree to this??
@GOP @KellyannePolls And lie?
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump To hear him lie again?? Your country is a joke!
@GOP @KellyannePolls Ya, he did a good job of that in Syria with American soldiers. His reckless knee jerk decision cost them their lives!
@SenatorRomney @POTUS I see you are now falling in line. That didn't take long. Traitor!
@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump Because Trump is a liar! He said Mexico would pay. This was not an issue for two years and now it is a crisis! What a joke. You own this mess Reps!
@GOP @realDonaldTrump He has no leadership skills. That is why we are in this mess. His whole life has been my way or the highway. Doesn't work in American politics. He is a joke!
@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump Fucking showboating. Open the gov't and quit ruining peoples lives. Spin it anyway you want.....you own the shutdown!
@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump And Mexico would pay!!! Remember??
@LindseyGrahamSC Come on…..it's so weak!
@marklevinshow Of course you do. You have never disagreed with anything he has ever said. If he said bomb Canada you would agree. That's what makes you not credible! FAKE
@IngrahamAngle Who wants to watch him just lie over and over. It has become tiresome!
@realDonaldTrump Please try to tell the truth!
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump You shouldn't really talk about lying. You have a daughter who is the second biggest liar in the land!
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump I hope they do before you ruin the country! May be too late. You're a joke!
@DonaldJTrumpJr @Amy_Siskind Jr is angry today. Forget to take your meds loser??
@RyanAFournier What about a lying President??
@IngrahamAngle Fox is embarrassing!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Trump created this himself with all the lies. He is a fake President! And you have all fallen in line and lied your way through the first two years. How do you expect to have any credibility when you act this way. Wake up, tell the truth and unite the country. It is your job!
@BuckSexton @realDonaldTrump Why we're lets make of list of the 8000 plus, plus lies Trump has told! How about you call him out once in a while. Because you have zero credibility!
@realDonaldTrump @newtgingrich Newt has zero credibility and in fact is responsible for the divided country. Who cares what Newt lies about!
@TimSmith6052 @KristySwansonXO @realDonaldTrump So it's okay? He's the President for Christ sakes. He is supposed to set the example for the country. No President has lied so blatantly like him. Your country is an embarrassment to the world and yet people continue to support his behavior.
@BuckSexton Trump has told over 8000 lies since taking office. How can you defend this? Is this normal? Is it what you want for America? I don't get it!
@GOP @LaraLeaTrump Who gives a crap what she thinks!
@realDonaldTrump Are you sure they want you there? Your knee jerk decisions could possibly be the reason for this tragedy.
@realDonaldTrump This is your problem. There is so much more to being President then the economy. You are supposed to lead, be a role model for a younger generation, unite, tell the TRUTH! You have failed miserably!
@BuckSexton Because Obama is not a criminal like Trump. Everything out of Trumps mouth is a lie. I don't get how people think that is normal behavior. I understand he needs to defend himself but he has created this reality TV Presidency. It is ruining your country. Wake up!
@BuckSexton Could be but no one lies more then Trump. He has created this himself!
@KristySwansonXO @realDonaldTrump Trump is the biggest fake of all.  He has lied over 8000 times since taking office! How can you defend him?
@GOPLeader Spin it all you want. Trump owns it and American feel that way!
@marklevinshow Your insane rants have zero credibility. You haven't got a clue what Mueller has. You are so one sided you are a joke!
@IngrahamAngle Everyday tehy refuse to pass common sense gun laws, Americans will die! Wake up!
@KellyannePolls Have you apologized for all the lies you have told? Didn't think so!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Lying? Seriously? You fucker lie more then anyone on the planet!
@realDonaldTrump Well that would be you! You lie more then any of the news agencies.
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @POTUS GR, There are just too many lies. How can anyone take him serious or believe he doesn't have skeletons in his closet. POTUS is not a business to just make money. It is leadership, integrity and American values. Trump has none of these. Your country is a joke because of him!
@KristySwansonXO @RealJamesWoods You make it sound like she's the only one!
@EricTrump @trumpwinery Is this true? Or just another Trump lie.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Lots of lies coming I suspect!
@GOP @LaraLeaTrump Spin it anyway you want. Trump owns the shutdown and the American people will blame him.
@johncardillo We'll see. One thing for sure is Trump constantly lies and you can't deny that. Why would anyone believe anything he says about this. Mueller will seal his fate eventually.
@GOPChairwoman Who gives a shit. You are ruining the country. You are the laughing stock of the world. Wake up America!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Why, he will just spew lies! That's all he does.
@senatemajldr When are you going to call out this President. I hope you go down with him. Disgraceful!
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Are you lying again??
@DavidLimbaugh How bout that buzzfeed story!
@DanielTurnerPTF Too bad he won't be around to enjoy it!
@marklevinshow Hey, What did you think of the Buzzfeed news?
@Harlan hahaha....we'll see. I can't believe anyone could be surprised or try to deflect, defend. At least you didn't blame the Clintons! This is the beginning of the end!
@realDonaldTrump WTF does this mean??
@willchamberlain The beginning of the end! How can any sane person be surprised. Trump lies constantly out loud to anyone who will listen. I can only imagine what he is like in his personal business.
@Barnes_Law hahah....you just wait. At least you didn't blame the Clintons or Obama. I expect that will start soon. He is going down this time!
@JackKingston @RockinWilly68 Of course you agree. Have you ever disagreed with what the President said? Even though his knee jerk reaction to remove troops from Syria caused the death of 4 American soldiers?
@ArthurSchwartz Unlike Trump?? You have to be joking!
@BillOReilly @realDonaldTrump Trump won't be there!
@mikandynothem @DineshDSouza @KatTheHammer1 @grizz_meister @chuckwoolery @DiamondandSilk @LeahR77 @Trump454545 @DonnaWR8 @codeofvets And you think this kind of behavior is appropriate? WTF is wrong with your country. This is a disgrace!
@RealJamesWoods I don't think a Trump supporter should talk about lying. Are you kidding me? This is the shit that makes you lose credibility!
@TaxReformExpert I'm glad Rep think this is funny. Meanwhile Americans can't make mortgage payments and Trump thinks this is reality TV. His knee jerk behavior also cost 4 American lives in Syria. What is wrong with you people!
@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump @foxnewsnight @FoxNews @ShannonBream Trump has closed the gov't and Americans are struggling to pay bills and put groceries on the table. Four Americans die in Syria because of knee jerk decisions and not listening to his experts. Your country is a joke. Wake the fuck up!
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity Oh look lies!!
@BorisEP @SpeakerPelosi @IlhanMN You mean like the way Trump did in Charlottesville?
@tedcruz Why so we can hear him lie for a couple of hours. You know that is what will happen Ted. Trump is slowly ruining your country and you bastards do nothing! What is wrong with you!
@kimguilfoyle @DonaldJTrumpJr @LaPetiteRobeMi @jacobandco Congrats! Did you know there are people not able to make mortgage payments and 4 US soldiers died because of Trumps knee jerk decisions and not listening to people who know what they are talking about. Enjoy your lavish life!
@BillOReilly Never before has there been an alliance like the President and the Russians. Wake up America. Your country is falling apart!
@GOP @kayleighmcenany Trump owns this mess. Kayleigh has no credibility because she never criticizes anything Trump does. Your country is a laughing stock!
@LouDobbs @CharlesHurt @POTUS Trump owns the shutdown and can end it with a pen. No one needs to help him. What an embarrassment your country has become!
@RyanAFournier I'm glad you idiots think this is a big joke. People are not working and being paid....missing mortgage payments and Trump is sending condescending joke letters. This isn't reality tv...its real lives. What is wrong with your country!
@Hbobrow1Hbobrow I am sure I have seen a few lying tweets....
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Spin it anyway you want....Trump owns the shutdown. He said so. Your country is an embarrassment!
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi You know this isn't reality tv Trump! This is peoples lives. I am glad you think a condescending letter is real funny but people can't pay bills. Open the gov't you jackass!
@GOPChairwoman Your country is a joke! Open the gov't! This isn't a game show!
@HouseGOP How's that Trump shutdown going? This isn't a game show Donald....it is peoples lives. Open the gov't!
@SteveScalise Liar! Trump owns the shutdown....he said so!
@jackiemconeil @codeofvets @BurgerKing @POTUS Both sides. They are ruining peoples lives for political reasons. The gov't should be open! People need paychecks.
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Your country is a joke. People can pay there bills and you think this is funny. WTF is wrong with you!
@GOP @realDonaldTrump No, you need it to be re-elected. You don't give a shit about anything else!
@jackiemconeil @codeofvets @BurgerKing @POTUS It's shouldn't even be news. It's stupid. Your country is becoming a big joke. There all to blame!
@BuckSexton Ya what a scream! Your country is a joke. WTF is wrong with you people!
@RyanAFournier @SpeakerPelosi I'm glad you think this is a big joke. Your fucking country is a joke. WTF is wrong with you idiots!
@OliverMcGee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi I can't believe you idiots think this is appropriate. Both side are to blame but this kind of behavior is exactly why we are at this point. What a joke!
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @Delta This is such an embarrassment to your country. I am glad you think it is a big joke.
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi Do you think this condescending message helps? WTF is wrong with your country. You are the laughing stock of the world. Wake up!
@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump Trump is doing the exact same thing! Call him out. Why wasn't the wall a priority in his first 2 years when he had control. Don't be a hypocrite!
@codeofvets @BurgerKing WTF are you talking about. It's a joke. Plus it is aimed at one idiot!
@IngrahamAngle What is the point! He will just spew lies and quotes from Fox. What a waste of time!
@realDonaldTrump Wrong sporto! You own this mess and your "art of the deal" has turned into the "big pile of crap". You are ruing the country!
@GOPChairwoman Trump owns the shutdown and the American people know it regardless of how you spin it. Good luck unwinding this mess Reps!
@Jim_Jordan @LouDobbs Who cares what Lou thinks! Also Trump will just spew lies so what is the point of even having the SOTU??
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Mexico is supposed to pay. I know you are okay with lies but most of America isn't!
@blingarama @Bethigurl @RyanAFournier Ah he said ISIS was defeated. They don't play it on FOX so you must have missed it. Wake up! Everything out of his mouth is a lie!
@JackKingston Give it up Jack. Did you see your buddy Rudy last night. Sounds like he knows something is coming. Good luck!
@RyanAFournier True story....Trump is a racist and if you worship him as you do.....you are a racist!
@IngrahamAngle @mschlapp @RaheemKassam @MoniquePressley @SteveScalise @FoxNews lots of lies....have fun!
@GOP @VP The VP should take a couple of days off after saying ISIS is destroyed!
@TomiLahren @iamcardib Better then David Duke!
@VP @WhiteHouse @POTUS You should probably take a couple of days off. You are making a jackass of yourself as usual. Stop the fear mongering and maybe make up to the families of the Syrian soldiers who died today. Trumps knee jerk reactions and your insensitivities are more of a problem then the border
@RyanAFournier Who gives a damn what he thinks!
@David_Gergen @AC360 He should have named the book "Bully until you get your way"
@RealJamesWoods The point is that it is too late. There are more guns then people in your country now and you can get them like candy. It's disgraceful but now America has to deal with the outcome and the death they cause.
@RyanAFournier Wonder what he thinks of his old man causing the deaths of 4 soldiers in Syria today. Maybe the Dems should bring their families to Wash to use them as political pawns. Jr is a joke!!
@VP Rough day....should have prayed more!
@newtgingrich You know this is bullshit Newt. Why didn't trump make this a priority in the first two years. The American people see through the fear mongering.
@chuckwoolery Sounds like you are hoping for an outcome.....sick bastard!
@VP @WhiteHouse @POTUS Why don't you focus on a real crisis and ban Assault weapons! More American die from gun violence by far then illegals. This is awful for these families but using them as political pawns is a disgrace.
@LouDobbs @Jim_Jordan @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Trump owns the shutdown. Spin it anyway you want but he will be blamed. His reckless behavior cost 4 Americans their lives in Syria today. I can anyone accept this behavior and think it is good for the country. Wake up!
@BorisEP @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump @DHSgov Say whatever crap you want to spew. Trump owns the shutdown and he is ruining your country everyday. Wake up!
@newtgingrich Why can't they protect the border???
@newtgingrich @realDonaldTrump Newt, this is exactly how you worked and divided the country with your political antics. Don't be a hypocrite!
@SecNielsen How come you are fully prepared to protect the SOTU but can't protect the made up border crisis?
@SenateGOP @RoyBlunt @DHSgov @SpeakerPelosi Spin it anyway you want. Trump will be blamed for the shutdown and this is all just fear mongering.
@SecNielsen Open the gov't!
@VP I hope your team realizes that Trumps knee jerk decisions have consequences and in this case could very well have cost American lives. Someone need to take control of what he is doing. This is not a reality TV show!
@WhiteHouse I hope Trump realizes his knee jerk decisions have consequences. He is in way over his head and needs to start trusting his experts.
@StevenTDennis Trump lack of knowledge and knee jerk decisions have now caused US soldier to be killed. When is someone in his party going to stand up and admit he is in over his head?
@WalshFreedom Pence owns it! He knows they are not defeated and it blatantly lying. That is what this leadership does!
@TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump Interesting how you think a porn star is some kind of trophy for the Pres. Sad what your party has become!
@WalshFreedom Still bad optics
@benshapiro Oh you mean fear mongering? Why doesn't he do it from Sandy Hook?
@senatemajldr Brutal....how have you ever collected a paycheck? You are a disgrace to the country!
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump Isn't Trump doing the same thing? This "crisis" was hardly talked about in the first two years when he had control. Now he is picking a fight because Hannity thinks he should. Both sides are to blame I would agree but Trump is only pushing this because his base wants it.
@Steve54405724 @sxdoc @Redhead4645 @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @POTUS @LindseyGrahamSC @DonnaWR8 @bbusa617 @IWasHrren @kimguilfoyle @LouDobbs How many American are killed by gun violence? Not just school shootings. 1000's a year....Wake up America!
@VP @StateDept @POTUS I hear your wife got a new job? Shame on you !
@sxdoc @Redhead4645 @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @POTUS @LindseyGrahamSC @DonnaWR8 @bbusa617 @IWasHrren @kimguilfoyle @LouDobbs Why don't you put up a picture of the Sandy Hook kids and fight for them? Assault rifles are a much bigger issue in America then Trump's stupid wall. Get your priorities straight!
@jaketapper I suspect Trump will lash back shortly. He has nothing else to do!
@BM_Wisniewski @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews He is a Trump clone. Just says whatever he wants and expects everyone to believe it's true. He is a joke!
@HillReporter Sadly he is listening to her!
@GeraldoRivera Fence+ Banning Assault weapons= Compromise!
@RealSaavedra Why don't you do the same with American citizens and gun control? This makes no sense to me that you don't give a shit about young children being slaughtered by an assault rifle yet the rare occurrence of an illegal killing a citizen is a crisis? WTF is wrong with you people?
@Jim_Jordan Are you kidding me? Trump bragged about Mexico paying for the wall then did nothing about it for two years. Why is now such a crisis? The American people are seeing through this bullshit!
@bennyjohnson They have to have wall because of your stupid gun laws.
@realDonaldTrump I assume this is a lie!
@realDonaldTrump You own the shutdown and the America people know it. This will be your biggest gamble and loss!
@MAGAindex Because Trump is building a wall because he has a small penis! He doesn't give a crap about national security!
@BuckSexton @FoxNews Why is it so irrational when his whole existence is a lie! WTF is wrong with you people for putting up with his behavior??
@RyanAFournier The fact people vote for a party that doesn't care about children being slaughtered in a school....the party who's leader is a sexual assaulting, lying traitor blows my mind!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump how much did it cost you to put that caravan together to scare americans?
@RepGosar @POTUS Trump should be meeting with the Mexican Pres. They are supposed to pay....remember??
@realDonaldTrump Liar!
@DonaldJTrumpJr It's terrible what happened to these families but the fear mongering is crazy. You are using these people for political reasons. What a joke!
@kayleighmcenany Doesn't Trump have like 20 sexual assault claims against him? Why would any female want to work for him???
@TheLeadCNN @David_Gergen Nope....trump alone. He is an lying embarrassment to your country! How can anyone support his behaviour?
@senatemajldr @MittRomney Then step up to the traitor Trump!
@RealJamesWoods It's sad your society is like that. You all claim to live in the greatest country in the world but you have primitive views on gun violence. Hatfield and McCoy's is everyday life. I don't get it.
@marklevinshow You can exchange lies!
@RealJamesWoods I thought it was funny.....and I hate the jackass!
@RealDrGina @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump Sure if you like sexual assaulting, Lying, traitors! Whatever floats your boat. What a joke!
@newtgingrich @realDonaldTrump Why doesn't trump get his buddy Putin to give him a hand?
@GrizzleMeister Do some research....he has a history of this behavior. Not unlike Trump
@GeorgePapa19 @nytimes Who cares!
@burgessev What about gun violence??? Much bigger crisis
@Jim_Jordan Trump will be blamed and should be. What a disgrace your country has become!
@DavidLimbaugh Trump own the shutdown and America overwhelmingly agree. This will end poorly for him
@DavidLimbaugh Of course you do. You kiss his ass every chance you can. This issue didn't seem to be a priority until 2019. Trump had two years when he controlled gov't. Why now? He also promised Mexico would pay. The stupid wall is all politics!
@WalshFreedom It may save a child's life.....or a suicide....or a home invasion murder
@RepMarkMeadows Trump should invite the Mexican Pres. He said Mexico was paying I think I heard somewhere. American people know Trump is a liar and a fake!
@RyanAFournier Liar!
@Jim_Jordan @RepCummings Tell that to your boss. Trump calls the press the enemy of the people!
@senatemajldr What a hypocrite!!! Unbelievable!
@PARISDENNARD @realDonaldTrump Never questioning him and kissing his ass all the time makes you not relevant. You habe to question some of his behaviour? Come on
@VFMAString @GovMikeHuckabee It is not unusual for citizens to travel with firearms you moron! Wake the fuck up and fix an actual crisis in your country!
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Why didn't you resolve this when you had control of the gov't. Seems pretty suspicious it is a political ploy??? Why don't you fix your insane gun law which is actually a crisis in your country!
@LouDobbs Why do you idiots always default to Obama and the Clintons yet totally ignore all the evidence on Trump? Did you know Trump lied over 8000 times since becoming President? Are you okay with this alone? What is wrong with you?
@PARISDENNARD @WhiteHouse @McDonalds Of course you do. Who wouldn't support a sexual assaulter, liar and traitor to America. Tells a lot about your character!
@WhiteHouse This is a lie!
@GOP @GOPChairwoman I see Ronna has taken up the Trump strategy of lying to the American people. Trump has created this mess with his my way or the highway strategy. It may have worked in business but gov't has rules and laws. Open the gov't!!
@SteveKingIA You have a right to free speech but there is consequences that go along with that right. You are a racist and America doesn't need it's leadership to spew that crap!
@ashleyfeinberg Even a blind squirrel gets a nut every once in a while!
@realDonaldTrump No because it is probably a lie.....you just don't get it do you?
@marcorubio Why is it a crisis now and not the first 2 years of this idiotic Presidency when Trump had control of gov't? Its all a political game to him and American lose. You are an embarrassment to the world!
@WhiteHouse Too bad you don't have the same outrage when someone shoots up a school with an assault rifle. When that happens it is thoughts and prayers and it is always too soon to talk about solutions. What a joke your country has become.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump This is not news....don't go low!
@KristySwansonXO @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @McDonalds Why are you tweeting about this so much? This is not news....it's annoying!
@RealJamesWoods What the fuck do you think Rep have been doing for the last couple of months? What a hypocrite! The wall was barely mentioned for the past two years and now it is this massive crisis. What a joke!!
@GovMikeHuckabee It's a sad statement on your country that you need to travel with a firearm. Immigration isn't your problem....guns are. Wake up America!
@KristySwansonXO What women wouldn't want to eat Wendy's with a sexual assaulting, lying, traitor??
@RyanAFournier Gun laws instead of building a stupid wall!
@GreggJarrett I'm sure there will be lots of lies!
@Jim_Jordan Didn't you say Mexico would pay? Oh right....you Rep. lie!
@newtgingrich @seanhannity @FoxNews Two of people that have divided the country more then any. An embarrassment to the country!
@TomiLahren What the fuck does this mean? Loser!
@GOPChairwoman @GOPLeader You took the high road and couldn't resist taking the low road. Too bad. You had a chance to start uniting the country on an important issue and blew it. Too bad.
@marklevinshow Is no one allowed to criticize or challenge Trump? I know you kiss asses don't but this job Trump has isn't a game show. He works for all American and should answer to the people and the party leaders. WTF is wrong with you people?
@chuckwoolery That is the stupidest tweet I have seen in a while.
@realDonaldTrump Lots of lies.....have fun!
@LouDobbs Why do you idiots always default to the Clinton and Obama? Trump has lied over 8000 times since taking office and you dumb asses still defend his behavior. I don't get it! WTF is wrong with you people!
@PARISDENNARD @realDonaldTrump @GOP @GOPChairwoman @marthamaccallum @FoxNews Trump did nothing about his stupid wall for two years and now it is a crisis? Meanwhile 100's of American die from gun violence everyday and that is no problem to a Rep. Wtf is wrong with your country? Trump is ripping it apart!
@SarahPalinUSA Publicity stunt. This is not helping American families. This is not a fucking game. What is wrong with your country. Trump is literally tearing you people apart. What a joke!
@RyanAFournier This is a lie. They are fund raising because Trump left Americans to die in their State!
@RepMarkMeadows How do you know they don't have any real evidence? Trump is a dishonest person I am sure you can agree. Why is it unimaginable he could do something this crooked?
@KellyannePolls What about Sandy Hook parents?? Is there pain not real? Where is the ban on assault rifles. 1000's of Americans are killed and yet you ignore their pain.
@WalshFreedom So let's do nothing and have 1000's of people die?! America is the only Country that has this kind of violence and yet nothing is ever done. Now your fighting over Trump small penis wall! Wtf is wrong with you people!
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Didn't Trump say Mexico would pay? He has lied over 8000 times since becoming President. Is this behavior acceptable to you Lindsey?? What is wrong with you people for putting up with this bullshit?
@GeraldoRivera @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Do you think Trumps behavior with Putin is acceptable. I don't need proof. He has never called him out and if he did not have a translator with him or destroyed correspondence, I think any normal person would find that a bit suspicious.
@realDonaldTrump Mexico is supposed to pay LIAR!
@GOPChairwoman @LaraLeaTrump This is all lies. The majority of the American people don't want the wall. Fix guns in your country....they kill more Americans then illegal immigrants!
@NextRevFNC @TomiLahren So is Trump. And he is willing to ruin the country for his stupid wall!
@senatemajldr You are correct, American families deserve safety. Yet you Rep do nothing about gun deaths in your country. It is unbelievable you are pushing this "crisis" bullshit when 100's of people die from gun violence everyday! Wake up America!
@RealJamesWoods It was a fund raiser because Trump ignored US citizens!
@realDonaldTrump This is all lies. How can you people believe anything Trump tweets! It is astonishing people are so ignorant!
@marcorubio @jguaido You declare Trumps Presidency illegitimate!!
@RyanAFournier Does banning assault weapons help with ending school shootings? Not sure, never been tried!
@BillOReilly @seanhannity Lots of lies I suspect! Have fun!
@GOPChairwoman It's tragic but it's is also fear mongering. You could do the same with school shooting victims, victims or gang violence and push for gun control. I don't see you complaining about that??
@kimguilfoyle @BreitbartNews You idiots fight like hell for a wall for "safety of Americans" but do nothing about 100's of Americans dying every day to gun violence. WTF is wrong with you people. It makes no sense!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump There is no crisis. Your crisis is gun violence. Do you not care about 100's of American dying everyday??
@LisaMarieBoothe @AOC Of course he doesn't care. He doesn't give a shit about any American except himself!
@BillOReilly Yes, very strange anyone could support such a traitor. Yet all you jackasses continue to let him lie and blame the Clintons!
@marcorubio @POTUS Why wasn't trump pushing for this border wall for the past two years when he had complete control? You are all a bunch of lying hypocrites on both sides. Trump is never getting his stupid wall and he is to blame for the shutdown!
@GovMikeHuckabee Change your stupid gun laws and people won't need to be protected. Gun violence is a much bigger problem then a family trying to better their life from another country!
@realDonaldTrump Maybe if you told the fucking truth once in a while you would gain some credibility with the media. Your constant lies and bullying are why they report the way they do. Wake up you jackass!
@GOP @realDonaldTrump I thought I saw the Donald in Texas?? Lies are easy for you people!
@DonaldJTrumpJr @GOP Did FOX ever invite a gun control advocate on their show after a school shooting? Didn't think so!
@realDonaldTrump The country blames you. You need to end the shutdown since you started it.
@AnnCoulter Don't forget guns....oh wait, you bastards don't give a shit about kids dying.
@RyanAFournier What makes you think tougher guns laws won't end school shootings?
@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump More deaths from Guns in America Lou. Why don't you focus on a real crisis. Your crap is all made up to scare people!
@PressSec You are a fucking disgrace. Your boss golfed over a 100 times. Besides there is no crisis otherwise you would have been talking about this the past two years. Did anyone tell you that your boss works for the Russians? Just checking.
@DFBHarvard I don't understand why you don't feel the same way about guns. It is in most cases even more tragic because totally innocent lives  are lost. (including children...remember Sandy Hook?) Drugs are tragic but often a choice made by people.
@realDonaldTrump You are a disgrace! Stop your fear mongering and lies.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Stop your fucking lying and fear mongering! This is all a waste of tax payer money. Stop the blame game and do your job of uniting Americans!
@Jim_Jordan @MariaBartiromo @SundayFutures Well we wouldn't want to insult the traitor!
@AnnCoulter He didn't in the first two years of his Presidency. Why is it so urgent now?
@JackKingston @JSternburgProd Hey Jack, how do you feel about your President working for the Russians?? bet you are proud. Hope you come to your senses eventually!
@DonaldJTrumpJr This is a lie. 90% does not come from the southern border. Lying through life will eventually catch up to you.
@GOP @JohnCornyn How come it is a crisis now and not over the last two years? It's all Political bullshit at the cost of tac payers. Unreal any would buy this bullshit!
@Jim_Jordan @RepJerryNadler @POTUS What about all the arrest around Trump? Should we ignore these? Don't be a hypocrite!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Your old man has golfed over 100 times since becoming President. And he owns the shutdown.....he said so!
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump How do you know it isn't true? Because he's a good guy? Wake GR, Trump is crooked and has been all his life!
@LindseyGrahamSC Do you even give a shit about America? Wtf happened to you? Does Putin own you also?
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump This is all lies!
@realDonaldTrump Can you lie anymore?? WTF is wrong with you and your country for putting up with the bullshit over and over. I don't get it!
@realDonaldTrump So will eliminating assault rifles. It will save innocent children's lives. Isn't that important to you?
@JudgeJeanine @realDonaldTrump What an embarrassment for your country! I can't believe you people listen to this lying Russian employee!
@AP123Anna @DonaldJTrumpJr @SpeakerPelosi Of course not. The gun debate ended with Sandy Hook. Once Americans decided children can get slaughtered and nothing changed....it was over.
@kayleighmcenany Hey Kayleigh, although I disagree with your philosophy, what do you think about the President working for the Russians. I know you don't give a shit but I find it to be Un-American!
@AnnCoulter Why don't you defend your country from assault weapons? That is a much bigger problem in America then the border. Wake the fuck up.
@GOPLeader @JudgeJeanine @POTUS Hope you can come up with as many lies!
@simonamangiante Are you fucking kidding me? You probably believe Trump never lies either. What is wrong with people!
@JudgeJeanine @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Enjoy the lying!!
@gloria8397 @MichaelAvenatti @seanhannity @FoxNews @StormyDaniels @RudyGiuliani @KellyannePolls @TuckerCarlson I wonder what kind of cut the Russians would get from Trump since he works for them.
@chuckwoolery Are you really okay with Trump working for the Russians?
@StevenTDennis How about counteroffer that Trump stops working for the Russians. Second, let's worry about children getting slaughtered in schools with assault rifles. Those would be good trades??
@RyanAFournier Hey, did you hear Trump works for Russians? You okay with that?
@GOP Here's an idea. Why not try saving some children is schools by banning assault weapons. Much more of a crisis in your country. Get your priorities straight instead of worrying about Trumps small penis syndrome!
@JudgeJeanine @realDonaldTrump Oh lots of lying!?
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @JesseBWatters @greggutfeld Is this an appropriate way to "make the deal". You are a joke. Art of the deal my ass.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @SpeakerPelosi Same as family of mass school shootings? How about gun control. Much bigger problem then the boarder right now.
@realDonaldTrump Oh look. A bunch of lies!
@PeterVanVoorhis @realDonaldTrump 5.7B could feed a lot of families that are starving. Don't be an idiot!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Oh look...another lie!
@realDonaldTrump Are you lying again?
@TomiLahren One school shooting with an AR15 is one too many. Ban assault rifles! Hypocrite
@kayleighmcenany @seanhannity @sabine_durden Fear mongering! Why don't you have the same passion when a school gets shot up and Americans die? Oh I forgot....you give your prayers.
@newtgingrich @realDonaldTrump WTF are you talking about. You are responsible for the division in this country. You blocked everything! fucking hypocrite!
@PARISDENNARD @realDonaldTrump Stfu! Trump says worse every fucking day. Do you think people are that stupid!?
@kimguilfoyle So does gun control!
@TomiLahren @foxandfriends I could say the same for you about school shooting victims family's.  You are a fucking hypocrite!
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @FoxNews You mean your senior advisor?
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump You know Trump needs the wall to be elected again. Save the fucking country Lindsey and stop kissing ass. You know this isn't necessary
@JackKingston I wonder how often these lies Rep tell are actually believed?
@Jim_Jordan @edhenry Lots of lies I bet!
@JaniceBray19 @IngrahamAngle We have mentally ill people in Canada too. The difference is we don't have guns the way the US does. No argument can dispute that fact.
@realDonaldTrump Why wasn't this an issue for the past two years?? Just now because Hannity says?
@Jim_Jordan @RepKatieHill Get your money from Mexico you liars!
@GOPChairwoman What about a bone spur pic!
@realDonaldTrump Liar!
@JaniceBray19 @IngrahamAngle If you cared you would support banning auto assault weapons. They have no place in society yet nothing is ever done. Gun violence by citizens is way bigger a problem then immigrant crime.
@RepMarkMeadows How would you feel if a Dem President did the same for gun control? That is a much bigger problem in ur country!
@GovMikeHuckabee @TBN You mean lying like the Pres and your daughter?
@BillOReilly And the most dishonest!
@IngrahamAngle Same way Rep treat school shootings! Hypocrite!
@TomiLahren @foxandfriends Same answer you have for school shooting you fucking hypocrite!
@KristySwansonXO @Acosta Your that petty? Brutal!
@realDonaldTrump I assume this is a lie. Also, there are 10,000 homicides from guns every year in the US. Why not declare a national emergency on that?
@GOP @realDonaldTrump @GOPLeader Why would they? Why would you support someone who spent the day lying over and over. I don't get it? Your once great country is now a joke!
@DonaldJTrumpJr This is the President of the United States not a fucking 12 year old. WTF is wrong with you people! Another embarrassment and you idiots think this is normal behavior.
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Trump spent the whole day lying. WTF are you smoking. Your country is a fucking joke! His small penis is the only reason he needs his wall.
@realDonaldTrump You are a joke. How do you feel about your lying filled day?
@Bencjacobs You mean he lied??
@ArthurSchwartz @realDonaldTrump WTF are you talking about. Trump spent the whole day lying. Is this normal behavior? Your once great country is now a joke!
@JohnCornyn Hope you enjoyed all the lying today. Just another day in the Trump admin.
@marklevinshow You forgot to mention liar and an embarrassment to ur country!
@GOP @realDonaldTrump He's been known to lie!
@newtgingrich @realDonaldTrump Says the king of political games and dividing the country. You should just zip Newt!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Now he know how you feel getting mocked on twitter all the time. Go away you buffoon!
@GOP @GOPChairwoman Good to know your whole party is behind this insane idea to spend billion of dollars because of Trumps small penis! How can you be taken serious as a party with all the lies, deflection and fear mongering. It is an embarrassment to your country!
@LindseyGrahamSC Why is this all of the sudden a huge crisis. I can't believe you are supporting Trumps behavior. At one time you were a respected politician on both sides. Now you are a joke!
@RepMarkMeadows Do you think people actually believe this crap? Trump is supposed to be the deal maker.  Guess not
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Remember this when the next Dem President uses his power to take away guns! Which btw would save far more lives
@GOPChairwoman You're accusing someone of lying??? I think your leadership needs to look in the mirror. What a joke!
@LindseyGrahamSC @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Mexico was paying.  That was the promise. You coward! Stand up and save your country before Trump does anymore damage!
@GOP @GOPLeader Oh look. A lie! Shocking
@charliekirk11 Wtf is this tweet? Stfu you idiot!
@PressSec She said he wall was. Border safety is important. Stop fucking lying!
@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump @AmericaNewsroom @FoxNews @BillHemmer @SandraSmithFox How do you defend these lies. It's all a publicity stunt. Mexico was supposed to pay....remember? How do you continue to defend the lies and bullshit? I don't get it!
@realDonaldTrump Liar!
@Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows @seanhannity You guys are a joke. What about Mexico paying? How do you defend the constant lies? Both of you have zero credibility!
@larryelder @realDonaldTrump The point is Mexico is not going to pay and it is just added to the list of bullshit lies Trump tells. How can you continually defend that behavior?? I don't get it.
@GeraldoRivera You can thank old @newtgingrich for creating a division in gov't.
@GOPChairwoman I thought I heard somewhere that Mexico was paying?
@parscale @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats What is it? 5%?
@TomiLahren I thought Mexico was funding the wall? I am sure I heard that somewhere?
@PARISDENNARD @realDonaldTrump I thought Mexico was paying? Just another lie I guess?
@larryelder I thought Mexico was paying? Oh ya, just another lie!
@JackKingston @realDonaldTrump @jonkarl Ummmm, Trump shut down the gov't. I believe he even said he would take credit. Don't tell me you are lying too?
@realDonaldTrump You using the word "facts" is quite humorous. Everything that comes out of your mouth is a lie!
@GeraldoRivera Dems and lots of Rep will never give Trump what he wants. He is cancerous to the country and they need to stop any positive momentum.
@BillOReilly He made his own bed claiming Mexico would pay. I can't believe any sane human would believe anything he says. Your once great country is now a joke!
@VP @rushlimbaugh @POTUS They did come to the table and the Donald blew a hissy fit because he didn't his wall without negotiation. You aren't fooling anyone with this bullshit. The Rep look foolish and they should!
@PressSec @SpeakerPelosi You are the biggest fucking liar on the planet so don't you dare talk about hypocrisy! Unbelievable that anyone can take you or Trump serious. It's like a reality TV show to you!
@RealJamesWoods That's because of wackos like you!
@GOP @SecNielsen This is such bullshit. Nielsen has no credibility, She lies!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump No crisis and Trump is not negotiated. He is saying his way or the highway....not a deal maker. No sane person believes anything you say.
@Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows @seanhannity Oh lots of lies! I'll pass
@GeraldoRivera GR, You are a voice of reason. You tell it like you see it. Why can't more FOX personnel act the same rational way?
@benshapiro Except half the shit he says are lies
@politicalelle Most heroine doesn't come through the southern border. It all lies to scare everyone
@JacobAWohl Your job involves propagandizing the American People with right wing disinformation. You're a joke!
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP @HouseGOP Unlike Trump?? Wtf is wrong with you people. Both sides are a joke. Your once great country is a laughing stock! You get what you deserve.
@LisaMarieBoothe @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Have fun lying!
@kimguilfoyle @realDonaldTrump Hypocrites! Rep do the same. All of them should be ashamed. So dysfunctional!
@replouiegohmert @realDonaldTrump 10,000 shouldn't die from gun violence either yet you remain silent! Hypocrite!
@realDonaldTrump Ahhh…..the deal maker! What a disgrace. Hissy fit if you don't get your penis growing wall!
@LisaDNews The deal maker!
@WalshFreedom Not to his base. What a fucking joke he is.
@larryelder @CNN @MSNBC @realDonaldTrump He also hired him
@LouDobbs Are you kidding me?? Trump had a deal a month ago but he listens to you talking heads and now he is never going to get one. It's a big game show to him. He doesn't give a shit about the American people. Only his ratings. Wake the fuck up!
@GOPChairwoman Over 10,000 homicides occur in the US because of guns. What is a bigger priority? Get your head out of your ass!
@PARISDENNARD @realDonaldTrump Are you kidding me?? This whole thing is a game show to Trump. Reality TV! He doesn't give a shit about anyone but himself and his ratings. Wake the fuck up!
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Source?? Didn't think so
@GOP @GOPLeader It's about Trump. End of story
@RepMarkMeadows You mean you expect Dems to give you everything you want and Rep give nothing. Do you think people are that stupid?
@IngrahamAngle You are seriously comparing what is going on now to the Obama admin?? Almost everything out of Trumps mouth is a fucking lie! What is wrong with you people?
@RealCandaceO WTF are you talking about? Tell that to someone not getting a fucking paycheck. Are you that stupid?
@GeraldoRivera @abbydphillip But she doesn't lie??
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump The crisis is in the WH!
@JackKingston 10,000 homicides in the US every year from Guns. This is a bigger problem Jack.
@PressSec @marcthiessen America loses Sarah. You know you are supposed to work for all Americans. What a disgrace all of you are!
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump Because both sides are so dysfunctional. It's an embarrassment to your country. (Not to mention you voted in Trump to begin with)
@kayleighmcenany Source? Probably the Donald!
@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump There is no crisis you dimwit. Stip fear mongering and lying to the American people! Wtf is wrong with you.
@newtgingrich @realDonaldTrump Newt, you are mostly responsible for the dysfunction of Wash. Dont preach something you know nothing about! Partisanship.
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump He doesn't have that emotion.
@BillOReilly Dems should be able to respond to the lies Trump will tell. American eesrved that also.
@VP @HallieJackson I see you are a fucking liar too!
@BillOReilly Peddling hatred is exactly what Trump is doing. Immigrants are less likely to commit a crime then a citizen. It's all fear mongering!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump His whole speech will be filled with lies. Is this the America you want? What a disgrace!
@IngrahamAngle @KellyannePolls @FoxNews Have fun lying!
@RyanAFournier How do people actually believe this crap??
@willchamberlain All created by Trumps policies. Wake the fuck up!
@GOP @PressSec With fear mongering!
@ddale8 Shocking!
@PARISDENNARD @realDonaldTrump @VP @SecNielsen @jaredkushner It's all fucking lies!
@GOP @PressSec This is such bullshit! How they these lies continue! Wake up America!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump What is ridiculous is the fear monger you are doing at tax payers expense. You should all be kicked out of office!
@PARISDENNARD @realDonaldTrump He is treating the presidency like a reality tv show! He doesn't give a shit about anyone but himself.
@AnnCoulter It's all reality tv to him. He is in character! He doesn't give a shit about actually securing the border.
@RyanAFournier Sources??
@AnnCoulter It's a political stunt for his base. I am sure he will meet with border patrol that will tell him people are "pouring" in the country. Its all bullshit. Nobody is ever going to get anything done in Wash!
@TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump When has Trump ever listened to anyone. Wake the fuck up!
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump This is such bullshit. There is no crisis! Why are you fuckers scaring everyone for political reason. What a crock!
@RyanAFournier Ya cause no Rep does that! Stfu idiot!
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump There is no crisis you fucking liar! You are creating all this fear for nothing. Wtf is wrong with you people!
@chuckwoolery Sorry Chuck, truth and Trump in the same tweet doesn't wash.
@kimguilfoyle Off course they are. Because everyone has a gun. They are like candy. Fix the fucking gun laws!
@Jim_Jordan @SpeakerPelosi Because both are a waste of money and shouldn't be a priority. Why don't you focus on saving American's from American's?? That's a bigger problem!
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump True. Mexico is supposed to pay for it also. This need to be addressed but there is no crisis at the border. The fear mongering makes Trump lose credibility. If he had any to begin with.
@marklevinshow No thanks....I would rather chew tinfoil!
@lesliebirkland @JacobAWohl Dear God! Are you that fucking stupid?
@GOP @LaraLeaTrump Wtf does she know. The country has gone backwards 50 years because of Trump. How can you people not see that? Unreal!
@marklevinshow You ever call out any of your conservative hacks on Fox? Fucking hypocrite!
@PARISDENNARD @realDonaldTrump @SecNielsen @PressSec Bullshit! It is all lies to scare the American people so Trump can get his politically driven wall. Anyone who says otherwise is also lying! That seems to be okay now with Rep.
@GOP You better get some immigrants in the country to do these jobs?!
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Does anyone in Washington actually give a shit about the country?? It is a disgrace that nothing gets done. Both sides are to blame. WTF is wrong with your country!
@MiaFarrow @SecNielsen It doesn't matter to them and their base. They are just on to the next lie. What a joke!
@GOPChairwoman @PressSec The American people also didn't elect Trump and Sanders to lie constantly to the American people! I can't believe anyone could think this is normal behavior. WTF is wrong with you people!
@marklevinshow Do you actually think you are the real press? You are so one sided the other way, you are irrelevant!
@realDonaldTrump Mexico is paying? Did you lie!? Shocking!
@RyanAFournier How will they pay the two trillion they have added to the deficit??
@JudgeJeanine You are okay with Trump "grabbing pussy" (as one of many examples) but have an issue with this? BTW she didn't say she didn't like him. There is enough baggage to get Trump impeached!
@lizpeek @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump We better let some immigrants in to do these jobs! Can't have it both ways.
@Jak_Riemer @NikkiHaley Agreed.....but nothing ever changes. Guns are a bigger issue then immigration. Thoughts are prayers are all we give.
@JudgeJeanine @KellyannePolls @CLewandowski_ @dbongino @FoxNews Hope all of you enjoy dividing America!!
@NikkiHaley Is this the same bullshit you Rep say after a school shooting? I don't believe you give a shit!
@realDonaldTrump You are going to need some immigrants in the country to do these jobs???
@RyanAFournier I thought Mexico was paying??? What bullshit! Who can believe any of this crap!
@kimguilfoyle I wonder if you post tweets like this for every cop killer??? Didn't think so.
@GOP @SteveScalise Bullshit! It's about keeping the WH. Why was this not a bigger issue over the past two years? You are all fucking liars!
@raulhGarcia @greta @senorrinhatch Too bad he is leaving as an enabler of the worst Presidential disaster in American history. This will all not end well and Hatch's silence hurts his legacy.
@HelenKennedy Yet he will remain silent.  Cowards!
@JacobAWohl it's okay Jacob. It doesn't make you a bad person.
@JacobAWohl Speaking of losers! Look in the mirror jackass!
@IngrahamAngle Rep can't preach the lowest unemployment rate and also claim jobs are taken by immigrants. There is not enough people to do some of these jobs. This is bullshit!
@realDonaldTrump You're not getting  your fucking wall liar!!
@codeofvets Are you kidding me?? Trump does this shit daily!. Is this as important as two children dying at the border in US care? Get your fucking priorities in order. What is wrong with you people??
@GOP @realDonaldTrump You forgot to mention increasing the deficit 2 trillion dollars. Nice work!
@RyanAFournier Trump will never get his wall. If it was that important to him he would have gotten it done when they controlled all gov't. He doesn't give a shit about anything but getting re-elected.
@GOP @GOPChairwoman This is all a political stunt for Trump. He doesn't give a shit about anything but himself! Get Mexico to pay like the fucking liar promised!
@GOP @PressSec Sarah is a pathetic liar!
@GOPChairwoman Trump promised to build a wall and have Mexico pay. Broken!
@GOPChairwoman He lied?!! Oh no. Rep never lie. Oh wait, that's  a lie!
@LisaMarieBoothe @KamalaHarris Yes the right is so pure! You will be sleeping with pirn stars, dining with Russians and blaming the Clintons for all their problems.
@GeraldoRivera @RashidaTlaib @realDonaldTrump You're worried about this but Trump has been responsible for 2 children dying at the US border and nothing changes? WTF is wrong with your country!
@realDonaldTrump Anyone from Mexico at the meeting to pay for it?
@GOPChairwoman And Trump never lies!
@realJeffreyLord Why is this news?
@newtgingrich Newt, Your boss won't like this?
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump What a disaster you people are. This is just a big game show to Trump! How do you not see that?
@RealJamesWoods Yet Trumps behavior is okay??
@LisaMarieBoothe Are you that stupid? Of course it is important. Diversity is great for America!
@LindseyGrahamSC You're not getting ur fucking wall. Move on and fix things that matter.
@Jim_Jordan @POTUS And you believe this? He doesn't give a shit about anything but getting elected again.  I can't believe any sane person could believe This!
@RealCandaceO Fear mongering you mean?
@IngrahamAngle @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump This is a stupid fucking tweet. Get a life!
@replouiegohmert Your not getting the fucking wall. Move in to reducing the deficit and something that actually works!
@marklevinshow You know that guy you add kiss all time? You just described him!
@GOPChairwoman Why don't you quit blaming everyone else and fix your own parties issues. You increased the deficit 2 trillion. Stfu!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Another massive debt report??…..
@senatemajldr @MarshaBlackburn @SenKevinCramer @SenMcSallyAZ @SenatorRomney @SenJackyRosen @SenatorSinema Hopefully you don't corrupt them!
@LisaMarieBoothe @cmclymer Are you kidding me?? Trump is the most unauthentic human on the planer? This is a game show to him and he doesn't give a shit about anyone but himself. How do you not see that??
@Robbin_Young @RashidaTlaib @POTUS @realDonaldTrump But Trumps behavior is okay with you??? WTF is wrong with you. Hypocrite!
@realDonaldTrump Your small penis and your wall is your motivation for 2020. Do u actually think people believe your crap?
@realDonaldTrump Very Presidential
@newtgingrich @realDonaldTrump Newt, you were the king of partisan politics and maybe solely responsible for the troubles the US is in. STFU!
@senorrinhatch Too bad your leaving as a disgrace for not standing up to Trump. Sad way to leave.
@PressSec What a joke you people are! No questions?
@RealJamesWoods Unlike Trump? Come on
@GOP @kayleighmcenany Stop putting Kayleigh on FOX. She has no credibility!
@GOPChairwoman Now taking to fear mongering I see. Won't work!
@DanielTurnerPTF The planet is a little more important then Trumps small penis!
@larryelder @MittRomney @realDonaldTrump @SenatorReid Because Trump is an embarrassment to your country!
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Another lie. Do you think anyone actually believes the shit you spew?
@larryelder Mexico is paying.....remember?
@RealJamesWoods How about 2020! I would take anyone but Trump!
@JacobAWohl This is a lie. Typical bullshit from a Trump ass kisser!
@RudyGiuliani Rudy, wtf are you talking about? Go away!
@VP @POTUS Is your only job to kiss Trumps ass? Stand up you coward!
@senatemajldr Hypocrite! You are the king of holding things up.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump At least he has the balls to speak his mind and not kiss Trumps ass like you. Trumps behavior is dangerous to the Country and the world. Not being able to challenge him ever is not Democratic. Your silence gives you no credibility!
@realDonaldTrump You are such a liar!
@realDonaldTrump This is another lie. Add it to the list!
@realDonaldTrump You lied! No one believes this bullshit
@justinsink U mean he lied? Shocking
@GOP @DonaldJTrumpJr Who fucking cares!
@RadioFreeTom She won't get the nominee but she has way more credibility ten that asshole in the WH now!
@RyanAFournier Probably bought at the corner store like everyone else can.
@RealDrGina Americans aren't smart.....they elected Trump! Some people actually still support him.
@JacobAWohl Because the commander in chief doesn't know wtf he is doing!
@realDonaldTrump This is another lie
@RealJamesWoods R u kidding me? Same way McConnell Does!. Hypocrite
@realannapaulina @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Are you fucking kidding me? Trump kisses Putin's ass! He has never said a negative thing about this monster. WTF are you talking about.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump You coward! Again you kissed ass instead of standing strong. When this Presidency ends, you will look like a fool!
@realDonaldTrump Just when I thought you couldn't tweet anything more stupid!
@realDonaldTrump This is a lie. What else is new!
@realDonaldTrump Liar!
@JacobAWohl I am sure you will blame Obama and the Clintons.
@realDonaldTrump This is another lie. How can anyone think this behavior is normal??
@realJeffreyLord @DailyCaller So What?
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump You habe killed two children at the border! Let that sink in.
@jdawsey1 He doesn't have that kind of emotion. I really believe that.
@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump Why is this news?
@realDonaldTrump Hey diffus! I thought Mexico was paying! Liar
@larryelder @realDonaldTrump How dare he make it a campaign rally. And the fucking lies!
@chuckwoolery This happens hundreds of time in US cities daily. Do you support doing anything about it?
@LindseyGrahamSC Lindsey, don't become a Twitter idiot like the Pres. Get Mexico to pay! That was the promise
@JoyAnnReid Nobody tell Trump! He will lose it.
@marklevinshow No one lies more than Trump Mark!
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS What is your comment on him blatantly lying to the troops. This is not normal behavior. How can any sane person accept this?
@IngrahamAngle Do you cover the hundreds of gun deaths everyday in your country? Didn't think So!
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump I trust the media more then your lying father.
@bahto76 @chuckwoolery I don't need to be. I watch him everyday lie to the American people. Are you disputing that?
@HB_Brucey @chuckwoolery @CNN So ur okay with the lies? 10% raise. First one to give raises is 10 years. He's a joke.  You can't believe anything he says!
@realDonaldTrump There are 100's of murders everyday in the US. Do some thing about guns to make your citizens safe!
@realDonaldTrump Can you imagine your legacy with all the lying? This will be remembered and your legacy. Is this what you want? Fake President!
@realDonaldTrump Liar!
@HoarseWisperer This is not news. It does not help the real problems with Trump
@chuckwoolery This ismt supposed to be a campaign rally! Also everything he said to the troops is a lie! Wtf
@RepMarkMeadows I recall the President owning the shutdown!
@PressSec I wouldn't call it an attack! Grow a backbone
@BillOReilly I agree but do you think it is okay for him to bold face lie to the troops? I just don't get how a sane person thinks this is acceptable behaviour
@RyanAFournier But it's okay for the Pres. To go over there and lie constantly. You are okay with That?
@DonaldJTrumpJr @WSJ Tell him to stop fucking lying! It's easy for moat normal people!
@RealDrGina @POTUS @FLOTUS @LouDobbs @DavidAsmanfox Apology? It is good he went but it has taken 2 years and he missed some significant opportunities.  He owes the apology!
@sean_hanntity @realJeffreyLord I think it is insane and scary he called you for advice.
@RepMarkMeadows This is the dumbest tweet I have seen today. Other then today, he has disrespected the military consistently
@LouDobbs @POTUS @realDonaldTrump It's amazing with all the chaos Trump creates you bitches keep blaming Obama and the Clintons for everything. He is ruining the country!
@PressSec Are you lying?
@realDonaldTrump Huh?
@StevenTDennis What the fuck is wrong with people. He is so how handily ruining your country and people think this is good news? Wtf is wrong with you idiots!
@larryelder @WSJ You know criticizing Obama and the Clintons doesn't distract people from the fact Trump is ruining your country. Are you that stupid?
@marklevinshow Get the nra to pay
@KateBennett_DC @FLOTUS I'm sure she has her own room. He wouldn't even know if she is back.
@realDonaldTrump How about that stock market DJT. Nice work!
@realDonaldTrump And the attacks begin! You are a joke.
@DiamondandSilk Why do you nuts seems to be blaming and lying about the Clinton more and more? Trump is ruining your country and all you idiots care about is the blame, deflect and lie game and then blame the Clintons.
@RyanAFournier Protect your lives from what? You have a better chance of getting shot with an illegal gun. Why not focus on that?? Get the fucking NRA to build your stupid wall!
@realDonaldTrump Mexico is paying correct??
@DanielTurnerPTF Ya, that's a patriotic and leadership style we want. Pout and potentially ruin the country until I get what I want. What the fuck is wrong with you! He's the Pres of all Americans!
@jdawsey1 Any Rep that thinks this is normal behavior needs their head examined. Trump is so dangerous to this country in so many ways yet all Rep remain silent. It is unreal how much they don't care about the country!
@LeahR77 This is ridiculous! You sound exactly like a Trump supporter. Blame, Deflect, Lie and blame the Clintons!
@senorrinhatch Don't blame Schumer....Trump owns this and you cowards that have not stood up to him. Adios!
@Jim_Jordan You are the assholes that aren't standing up to a President that is ruining your country! Stip kissing ass and challenge some of this behavior!
@GOPChairwoman And no more lying!
@LindseyGrahamSC You fucking coward!
@chuckwoolery And yet you continue to spew lies that this is normal and acceptable behavior.
@IngrahamAngle It won't  but don't try to normalize this. It is the beginning of the end of trumpy boy!
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Nobody believe this shit Mike. We all heard the President take responsibility. I know it is okay to lie in your house but most people don't act like that.
@RealDrGina Do you actually believe this crap? Trump doesn't give a shit about anything except making himself look good.
@realDonaldTrump Did you even know him?
@LouDobbs Lou, news flash.....Trump is lying! How can you be such an idiot!
@LindseyGrahamSC And Mexico is paying correct??
@AnnCoulter Because they hate Trump. Trump doesn't deserve the wall. I wouldn't give him anything.
@LindseyGrahamSC Who just increased the deficit trillions??
@larryelder @realDonaldTrump That fucking Mexico was paying for! Stfu
@realDonaldTrump Did your grandson draw this for you?
@BillOReilly You showed more sympathy to Mattis resigning!
@BillOReilly Wow....this is a new low! WTF is wrong with you!
@realDonaldTrump I see your focused on killing someone. You are a jackass!
@kayleighmcenany @Varneyco @FoxBusiness Trump owns this! Americans don't want your stupid wall! Not even your own party wants it. Time for you to start challenging some of Trumps behavior Kayleigh!
@IngrahamAngle Trump blows 5 billion on his golf games!
@marcorubio Not the same Marco....and Trump hasn't earned his fake promise! He is an embarrassment to your country!
@senatemajldr Too bad you are too much of a coward to protect America from this disaster. You don't seem to care about America's future and will do anything to protect yourself. You are a disgrace to America!
@IngrahamAngle Mcconnell should resign and you should evaluate your racist ideas!
@PressSec Nicely uniting the Country I see. If Mexico is so great, move there!
@LouDobbs @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @POTUS She is such a liar.
@GeraldoRivera @TuckerCarlson But racist comments are Okay? Come on GR....ur better than that. Tucker isn't
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Do you think people actually believe this?
@realDonaldTrump Nice way to unite the country. Brutal!
@realDonaldTrump And a 7 year old died from your decisions. Congrat!
@realDonaldTrump I thought ISIS was gone? Liar!
@replouiegohmert @POTUS To hell with doing the right thing! Just do what saves your ass! SMH
@JesseKellyDC He will just tell his base he will do it later and they will believe him. It doesn't matter what he does....they will never leave him.
@RyanAFournier 30% of Americans want it. You lie like the President!
@LouDobbs @ChristianWhiton @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Lies.....ISIS is not defeated. This will backfire. Stop lying
@kayleighmcenany I bet you all had fun lying to each other!
@realJeffreyLord Glad to hear you support racism!
@LisaMarieBoothe @POLITICOMag @KellyannePolls Maybe if she didn't lie and support a compulsive liar, she would have been successful. She made her own bed!
@realDonaldTrump America was the greatest country in the world. Not now. It is the laughing stock! You are an embarrassment!
@realDonaldTrump You are the biggest liar on the planet. End of story!
@realDonaldTrump OMG your obsession with the Clinton has made you a flawed human. WTF is wrong with you. Is your ego that fragile. BTW she won the popular vote!
@WalshFreedom Ugggh! How can anyone not support this Joe. We have to try something to stop these killings.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Research now says wall dont work.
@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump He also said Mexico will pay. Seems honesty isn't part of maga.  What a disgrace!
@newtgingrich Go away Newt. You have already divided the country beyond repair. Nobody cares what you think! Or lie about.
@PARISDENNARD @realDonaldTrump He's a criminal. This will not end well!
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump Tell the truth!
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @POTUS He pleaded fucking guilty?? WTF are you talking about. There is guilt surrounding this President. How do you continue to support him? Even a complete idiot would admit where there is smoke, their is fire. An inferno!
@marklevinshow and you continue to support a criminal. Start the blame, deflect, deny, lie and blame the Clintons. What a joke!
@PARISDENNARD @realDonaldTrump Trump had nothing to do with. He doesn't give a shit about anything that doesn't rile his base.
@WalshFreedom @LouDobbs He has turned into a grumpy sad old man. Too bad
@seanhannity All she wants to do is lie to the American people. It is disgraceful!
@realDonaldTrump You care about your base and nothing else. Who are you kidding?
@gramaredhen @BuckSexton Isn't sad we can trust the President?
@realJeffreyLord Tucker continually exhibits racist behavior which is not what your country should represent. Companies should run from this behavior. So should politicians but I fear this is becoming acceptable behavior and pushing America back 50 years.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Well you guys are experts in crime!
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Uh hello....Trump is shutting down the gov't! WTF are you talking about??
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Why spend it if the wall is useless?
@larryelder I see you've jump from the Clintons now to Bush. This is such bullshit. When will you be at Truman?? STFU
@LouDobbs @VicToensing Funny but Flynn isn't saying that. Quit spewing this shit Dobbs. Trump is going down and you should head for the hills!
@DavidLimbaugh No way they are giving Trump his wall. I wouldn't either.
@clairecmc I sure hope they come up with someone strong. I worry everyday Trump will win again. America should be embarrassed!
@DavidLimbaugh @marthamaccallum @ChrisCoons This is such bullshit. They just don't want the stupid wall. I guess you are a typical Rep with lies??
@tannerstake 20 kids get slaughtered at Sandy Hook by a mad man with an assault rifle. 		Rep do nothing but thoughts and prayers.
@TheRickWilson I can't imagine the stress she is under knowing she is going out there to lie. I know she has chosen her own fate but it is brutal to watch.
@BobEstesPGA @HarvardBiz @PGATOUR Not in golf. It is who is the best, not who applies.
@Kira_Media Is McCabe going to jail??
@FNC_Ladies_Rule @foxandfriends @edhenry @JedediahBila @PeteHegseth America loves Jerry Springer type TV....Congrats!
@BobEstesPGA @HarvardBiz @PGATOUR Wtf are you talking about Bob? Golf is a little different skill set then a firefighter.
@politico I do not like Sarah but for her to be put in the position isn't fair to anyone. She is lying for the President. I don't understand how any sane person would want this job.
@JudgeJeanine How are you feeling now? STFU
@LouDobbs Blame, Blame, deflect, deny! Stfu. Trump is to blame as he alienates the world.
@WalshFreedom I can't believe you have this position but you are okay with buddy popping into Walmart after work buying a AR15 and thousands of rounds of ammo and heading to a school.
@RealCandaceO This is complete bullshit!
@WalshFreedom @PressSec Do they care about the country at all or is everything about making Trump look good at any cost? SMH
@WalshFreedom @PressSec @FBI Yet no one on the Rep side every questions any of this behavior. Does Trump have them all the balls? Or are they secretly planning a coup? I just can't believe these sane adults are letting this happen to your country!
@ABCWorldNews @TerryMoran She is an American disgrace!!
@PressSec You are embarrassment to the Country. How do you get up there and lie, lie, deflect, deny and blame everyone else. What a fucking joke. Ever part of this has to do with the President.
@BuckSexton How can you continually defend all these people? That gives you zero credibility!
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Okay GR....you believe that!
@RepMarkMeadows Of course you would say this about the President too? He has not only ruined the reputation of the Oval office but America. All you fucker do is blame everyone else. It's a joke!
@BillOReilly It's astonishing to me that Trump continue this outlandish behavior and idiots like you still support and defend him. This is ruining America and no of you seem to give a shit. WTF is wrong with you people!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump WTF is wrong with you people?? How can you support this behavior and think it is normal. Not only is he a criminal but he embarrasses the US all over the world. I don't get it?? Pick someone with morals to represent the country with dignity.
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump 100% incorrect. This is fear mongering, lies and besides....let Mexico pay....that was the promise.
@RudyGiuliani You Rudy are a liar! Too bad you have chosen this path.
@TomFitton STFU about the Clintons.....what a joke!
@realDonaldTrump Another lie
@realDonaldTrump This is a lie.....
@JacobAWohl Why do you tweet. No one fuckin believes anything you say! Go away!
@kayleighmcenany @seanhannity @FoxNews Because the Rep don't have a clue!
@PressSec Look in the mirror for a fraud.....and your boss! You are an embarrassment to the country!
@realDonaldTrump liar
@RealDrGina You still believe in Trump....which is idiotic!
@RudyGiuliani Liar. What happened to you!
@realJeffreyLord Do you think Trump is anti press? Are you criticizing him? Do you think Carlson comments were appropriate? Didn't think so!
@PeteHegseth So you are okay with a President that breaks the law? How can anyone still support the behaviour he continues to exhibit? He fucking lies constantly, he has put the press in danger....yet people think this is normal! Unreal.
@joncoopertweets I find it hard to believe his ego would ever let him resign. I bet he lets his kids take the fall rather then him. That is how flawed he is.
@JackKingston @WayneDupreeShow Should we ignore other crimes Jack? How do you continue to defend him? It is unreal!
@chuckwoolery Are you going to see Trump in prison?
@realDonaldTrump How can you possibly lie any more? Brutal
@ThisWeekABC @GStephanopoulos It's sad what Rudy has become.
@DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump So you support committing crimes. Good to know!
@JackKingston Same could be said for Trump. Only a fool would support him still. We know where you stand. No morals!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump A seven year old died. Are you proud of this? Trump doesn't give a shit about anyone including you. Get out while you can!
@NextRevFNC @SteveHiltonx @TomiLahren @jasoninthehouse @CLewandowski_ @David_Bossie @FoxNews What a waste of space!
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump GR, Trump has made his own bed. He attacks everyone, lies constantly and some give it back. His fate will be determined by his own actions. He has no one to blame!
@realJeffreyLord WTF is reverse?? She lies. What is your point?
@RyanAFournier But you're okay with him being a criminal and a worldwide embarrassment??
@GregGutfeldShow He was joking jackass!
@RyanAFournier Ummm....who slept with the Porn Star?
@RealDrGina @realDonaldTrump And you have no problems with his behavior? Moral? Lies? He has embarrassed your country. That's okay??
@realDonaldTrump U can't do anything right with your tweets! You're like a 10 year old. People lost there fucking jobs. STFU and go away!
@thehill He doesn't give a shit. All political. Probably wasn't raining because those bone spurs are a bitch in the rain!
@realDonaldTrump People lost there jobs you asshole!
@DonaldJTrumpJr It's a lie so no need to worry
@thedailybeast Is he okay with him lying about everything! What a spineless jackass Graham has become.
@TeamCavuto @LindseyGrahamSC It's better then turning a blind eye to the law to get what you want!
@realJeffreyLord @BreitbartNews This is such bullshit!
@GeraldoRivera Here's a tip. Stop fucking lying!
@realDonaldTrump Ya too bad. Are you're such an honest person. I dont get it!
@KristySwansonXO Trump is to blame. He fights everyone including his own.
@RyanGirdusky @FoxFriendsFirst @HeatherChilders @realDonaldTrump Mueller, please hurry up and save the country!
@senatemajldr @senorrinhatch He's leaving as a coward who didn't stand up to corruption. Oh wait, sound familiar!
@neal_katyal Good for him? What a joke! What a coward! Nice legacy.
@thedailybeast None of these bastard have any morals.
@realDonaldTrump Great, Now 7 year old Americans can die without health care. Great job. Spread the pain everywhere!
@LouDobbs That's a weekend at the golf course for Trump. WTF!
@larryelder Because Mexico should pay for the wall and the planet is a little more important than Trumps small penis and his need for a big wall!
@RudyGiuliani Deflect, Deny, Lie and blame the Clintons. Get a new story Rudy. You are also copying Trump and it makes you look like a jackass!
@KellyannePolls @MickMulvaneyOMB @POTUS @WhiteHouse He better get a good lawyer!
@ABC Peanuts compared to the golf trips!
@KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse You're a liar!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump So you can let 7 year olds die!! You bastards have blood on your hands. I know Trump doesn't give a shit but some of you must have compassion!
@politico His base needs their heads examined!
@newtgingrich Blackmailed? WTF are you talking about newt. They're all gangsters and you know it. Wake the fuck up or go away!
@RealJamesWoods Are you kidding me?? Look what Trump has done to your once great country! Shit!
@kimguilfoyle @realDonaldTrump @MickMulvaneyOMB Hope he gets a good lawyer. He'll need it!
@MarkYoungTruth @TuckerCarlson You're defending a racist scumbag.....you shouldn't talk!
@RudyGiuliani What happened to you?? Didn't you used to have morals?
@LindseyGrahamSC Hypocrite! https://t.co/Hkj8NoeF08
@MarkYoungTruth Come on! You can't really believe Trump is clean? The guy is a slime ball! There is no way through all of this you can believe he isn't corrupt.
@chuckwoolery @BreitbartNews I'd care more he thinks then what she thinks. She lies like the rest of them Disgraceful.
@thedailybeast What a fucking hypocrite! And Liar! Fits right in
@senorrinhatch Too late. Nice way to leave. Your lack of backbone throughout your part will not age well. What a shitty legacy trump has created for all of you.
@MickMulvaneyOMB Get a good lawyer Mick!
@BorisEP @MickMulvaneyOMB @realDonaldTrump Hope he has a good lawyer!
@LisaMarieBoothe @TheStoryFNC @marthamaccallum @SusanLiTV @JessicaTarlov @FoxNews Great....you can all hangout and lie to each other!
@LouDobbs Because you are not the judge. He was investigated and nothing came of it. Same as the Clintons. They are not criminals. Trump is and will go down big Lou!
@Hbobrow1Hbobrow He doesn't give a shit. It means nothing to him.
@bennyjohnson Who gives a shit about this? Why is this even news??
@chuckwoolery a situation where a 7 year old doesn't die Chuck!
@thehill One weekend at the golf course!
@3inaustin Or pay for the wall!!
@shannonrwatts @MomsDemand I pray for the day automatic weapons are banned everywhere!
@GOP @KellyannePolls Are you sure he isn't lying about this?
@shannonrwatts It is a very powerful statement I must say. I hope you are right Shannon but I don't see the progress that is actually stopping these horrific events.
RT @DPJHodges: In retrospect Sandy Hook marked the end of the US gun control debate. Once America decided killing children was bearable, it…
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump @Paduch How can any sane person continue to support Trump. I don't care what your political identity is, Trump is a immoral human. Is this what you want American to represent?? He never tells the truth and when he goes down, you will look idiotic!
@RealDrGina I can't believe a sane human would still be defending Trump. Do you actually think he is telling the truth??? Dig deep down and look at the evidence. He never tells the fucking truth!!!
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump I wonder if Trump will pardon himself when he goes down??
@OutnumberedOT @HARRISFAULKNER He should admit he is a criminal!
@newtgingrich What a fucking waste of money!
@cnnbrk Too late. it's now his legacy and parting gift. It just shows you how these bastards will do anything to protect Trump. I don't understand why!
@DineshDSouza Just go away!
@realJeffreyLord @VanJones68 @CNN He won't be available!😂😂
@RealDrGina Ya or maybe Trump should stop being such a sleaze ball and stop fucking lying. What a joke!
@LindseyGrahamSC Hey Lindsey, Where was the good guy with a gun 6 years ago. How can this not make you want to change something??? You will never convince me this was not preventable! https://t.co/iYqsPVsX7Y
@RepMattGaetz @KennedyNation @FoxBusiness Why would anyone believe you lying bastards. Nothing out of your mouths is true. Get the money first! Good luck with that. What a disgrace!
@newtgingrich @realDonaldTrump I hope he picks someone that doesn't divide the country the way you did. You single handily have created this mess and should be ashamed. It will take years to unwind this Presidency and mend your once great country!
@Surabees @GOP @realDonaldTrump Hope he has a good lawyer!
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch @realDonaldTrump Deflect, deny, lie and blame the Clintons and Obama. Getting old!
@benshapiro I think they are saying Trump has played them all since being elected.
@kimguilfoyle I am sure I heard somewhere Trump said he would own it??? Maybe he was lying....
@Jim_Jordan Is Donald Trump a criminal? Yes!
@chuckwoolery Because trumps base love reality tv and hopes a Jerry Springer show will break out!
@DonaldJTrumpJr @GOP He is doomed! Hope he has a good lawyer.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Hope he has a good lawyer!
@SaraCarterDC Deflection, denial, lie and blame the Clintons. Go get a real job!
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump Here is a solution. Don't be such a sleeze ball!
@RadioFreeTom I realize all Politicians have trouble with the truth but this is a ridiculous level that Trump has created. Facts don't seem to matter and his base doesn't seem to care. They think they are never wrong!
@Truthseeker126 @HARRISFAULKNER @realDonaldTrump No because she kissed his ass and didn't challenge him. Why didn't she ask why he lies so much??
@juliettekayyem Trump is not smart enough to think this shit up. Who is driving this??
@FOX2News So sad.
@KBeals7 @KristySwansonXO I saw the whole video. Trump is an embarrassment to your country. He doesn't give a shit about anyone but himself and his ego. He will send Jr to the clink to save his own ass....you wait and see. Your once great country should be ashamed that you elected that jackass!
@kayleighmcenany @FoxFriends @FoxNews @SteveDoocy @ainsleyearhardt @kilmeade @jillianmele @CarleyShimkus @SchmittNYC @ToddPiro Do you guys stand around and lie to each other?
@larryelder Have you not visited inner cities? It's rampant! A lot of American have never gotten over having a black President. I have heard intelligent, good people say this. Racism is alive and well Larry!
@realDonaldTrump Are you kidding me?? You said you would be proud to shut down the gov't. Do you think people are that stupid? Maybe your base but not real American!
@KristySwansonXO Have you ever criticized Trump for hogging the ball? He has the biggest ego on the planet! Don't be such a hypocrite!
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump Um....collusion an non issue??? I don't think so.
@larryelder @StephenCurry30 @realDonaldTrump He was joking jackass!
@SpecialReport News flash.....he's a liar!
@BenSasse Are you kidding me? That would be like taking a concealed weapon to a bar.....oh wait....nevermind!
@LindseyGrahamSC Tell that to the Sandy Hook parents.
@realDonaldTrump Good thing you never make anything up!
@realDonaldTrump liar!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump I thought you said Dem didn't want border security?? Which is it? Just constant lies and bullshit from you!
@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump @FoxBusiness @Varneyco Another fucking lie!
@kayleighmcenany This is a lie. Why do you spew this crap.
@BillOReilly Are you fucking kiddimg me? He is a spineless kiss ass who hasn't stood up to the Presidents behaviour for 2 years. Unreal!
@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @AmericaFirst What would you have said if Obama did this Lou? Hypocrite!
@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump @AmericaNewsroom @FoxNews If you call embarrassing your country winning then yes he has!
@realJeffreyLord @newsmax Of course you think this. You never question the President. It has made you irrelevant.
@BuckSexton Of course u do. You never question anything about Trump. It makes you irrelevant
@realDonaldTrump Liar!
@Jim_Jordan Who's paying? Promise was Mexico
@PARISDENNARD @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @seanhannity He doesn't give a fuck about anyone but his Trump brand. How you dummies can't see that is beyond me. He will send Don Jr to the clink to save his own pathetic ass. You wait!
@larryelder @amyschumer @SenSchumer You are an idiot!
@SenThomTillis @senorrinhatch He is leaving as a coward. What an embarrassment!
@KateBennett_DC @FLOTUS When she has time? WTF does she have but time??
@LindseyGrahamSC Bullshit. The wall is a waste of money you know it. You are just trying to get Trump a ticky mark on his promise. Which btw was supposed to be paid for by Mexico. Go get them to pay you spineless coward!
@GeraldoRivera @MichaelCohen212 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS GR, he was Trump closest confidante. WTF are you talking about. Everything he did was for Trump. Your not making sense!
@realJeffreyLord Americans love Jerry Springer like television!
@kayleighmcenany @GOP Same approval rating as your corrupt President!?
@IngrahamAngle @Mediaite Americans love there Jerry Springer type shows! Congrats
@senorrinhatch Leaving with no backbone and a disgrace. Adios!
@GOP @SenTedCruz American or is do not want a wall and Mexico is paying...correct?
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Ahhh. Plead guilty to felonies directly related to Trump. Just another lie Mike! Come pretty easy to your family
@kayleighmcenany Always default to the Clintons. Stfu and fix ur own disasterist party!
@RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan There's lots of excuses. It's useless and Mexico was to pay. For starters!
@senatemajldr @senorrinhatch He is leaving as a coward just like you. Stand up to this President and save your country!
@DavidLimbaugh A wall is a waste of money. If someone wants to get in the country they will find a way.
@KristySwansonXO @FLOTUS Barf!
@GeraldoRivera The taxpayers are the real losers by funding a border wall that is useless. What's the difference. Plus remember who is supposed to pay for the stupid wall? Not taxpayers!
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump Why doesn't Trump get the $$ from Mexico like he promised. Don't blame the Dems for the lies!
@Jim_Jordan Exactly.....have Mexico pay for it or don't build it!
@LindseyGrahamSC You are a spineless coward to kiss ass like this.
@GeraldoRivera @MichaelCohen212 @realDonaldTrump Slandering Cohen doesn't make Trump look better if that is your angle. Trump has many of these slime balls because he is a slime ball!
@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump Why would you retweet this garbage!
@realDonaldTrump This has nothing to do with border security. Why do you scare the American people. Brutal!
@AnnCoulter It is with Rep also! It's a waste!
@LouiseMensch Someone lied in this Whitehouse? Unreal!
@SteveScalise @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews Lots to lie about! Blame the Clintons!
@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump What a joke. What a waste of money. I thought Mexico was paying.  You are all fucking liars!
@BuckSexton They should! Then Trump would be called out for all the lies he spews. He makes shit up every time he speaks. Its an embarrassment to your country!
@kayleighmcenany At least they have morals and aren't sexual predator, lying criminals. Do you think anyone buys the crap you spread on here?
@realJeffreyLord @IngrahamAngle I've decided to chew tinfoil instead!
@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump What colour is the sky in your world?? What are you talking about?
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump In spite of his lack of leadership. Do you think anyone believes this crap??
@kayleighmcenany But of course you won't criticize the President for doing the same. Good thing you aren't hypocritical!
@The_UnSilent_ Kisses Trumps ass fulltime.
@MAGAindex @realDonaldTrump Are you kidding me? He is a joke and a embarrassment to your country. What is wrong with you people that you accept this behavior. The wall is a waste of money and besides.....Mexico was supposed to pay I thought. Just another bullshit lie!
@KristySwansonXO Kavanaugh scandal cost about $2 because it was a sham investigation. Both sides waste a ton of money but the wall is a joke. That money could feed the homeless for a year! Remember Mexico was paying?
@blakehounshell Fail
@mitchellreports @realDonaldTrump @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer Wait for the tweets!
@RyanAFournier Because the wall is a fucking waste of money. Most Rep even admit that. Just you ass kissers support the President
@KristySwansonXO That's what he said! I guess the constant lying is okay with you. Great morals Kristy. I suppose you will support him still when he is indicted??
@KristySwansonXO @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump 30% of American want the wall. It is a waste of money and Trump claimed Mexico would pay. Don't spew this American people want it crap. It's not true.
@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump Mexico??
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Trump will fear he looked stupid in the meeting and will attack them later on Twitter while sitting on the toilet!
@DavidLimbaugh Your country has never had to apologize more than it is now. It will take forever to recover the issues Trump has created. Trump cares about Trump. Obama cared about America and humanity! STFU!
@mkraju Trumps tweet storm later should be interesting!
@kayleighmcenany They said they would. Just not build a stupid wall that Mexico was supposed to pay for.
@BuckSexton To bad Trump isn't good at leading a country! Bullying is his strength. What is wrong with America that they can not stand up to this behavior.
@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump What a fucking waste of taxpayer $'s. What disgraceful leadership!
@LindseyGrahamSC Are you actually going to praise this idiot for spending billions on something he claimed Mexico would pay for? What is wrong with you!? Grow a backbone
@WhiteHouse This is a lie.......another one!
@kayleighmcenany But you're okay with Trump shutting it down? Hypocritical again!
@AnnCoulter no they don't and they were promised Mexico would pay!
@GOP Who gives a crap what he says. He is so unqualified to be in gov't. What a joke!
@piersmorgan @realDonaldTrump @MailOnline You have the ego but that is about it. Not qualified.....although neither is Trump
@GeraldoRivera @MichaelCohen212 @POTUS Where as Trump is always truthful. GR, you don't know what Mueller has on Cohen....it isn't just his word. Trump is in trouble.....no way to put lipstick on this pig!
@Jim_Jordan Bullshit he kept his promise. He said Mexico was paying. Liars!!
@GOPChairwoman Your boss paid off a porn star. Any comments on that?? Didn't think so!
@alexanderbruz @realDonaldTrump Bullshit! The world has a moral compass, integrity, cares about human beings, poverty, famine, the planet. Trump doesn't give a shit about anyone but himself and how it makes him look. The world is better then this! So is America!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump And Rep would never do that! Come on! I thought Mexico was paying....not taxpayers
@realDonaldTrump the only wall being built is the one that will cave around you. BTW....I thought Mexico was paying, not taxpayers! Liar!
@jeneps Trumps boyfriend will never search the truth. Unreal that anyone thinks he is relevant!
@grantstern The President is different. He needs to follow law more then anyone!
@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump He's right! Trump is dangerous. He is an embarrassment to your country. I would give you 6 more year of Rep President if it wasn't Trump. I believe whoever took over would win.
@realDonaldTrump Huh??
@GOP @kayleighmcenany Kayleigh is no longer relevant. She is too one-sided!
@kayleighmcenany Paul Ryan is a spineless disgrace!
@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump How about that deficit!!??
@marklevinshow Oh...lots of bullshit lies!
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump @JudicialWatch Clinton, Clinton, Clinton......get a new angle buddy.
@marklevinshow Of course he is to you. You never criticize or challenge him. It's actually embarrassing and really makes you obsolete.
@marklevinshow how much longer will you defend your little lunatic friend in the WH?
@JackPosobiec Fact, You hacks cannot keep defaulting to the Clintons. What about Trump?? He's guilty. Is that okay??
@seanhannity Hey Hannity....what about that Trump fella? Looks like he might be in some trouble!
@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump @POTUS And you believe this BS?
@AriFleischer I almost get the feeling Rep don't care about truth or the law. Do you want Mueller to do a half ass investigation like the one for Kavanaugh? Did you complain about the Clinton investigations? Didn't think so!
@GovMikeHuckabee You wouldn't be lying about this would you? Cause I hear your family lies sometimes.
@larryelder @realDonaldTrump Why do you hacks always default to the Clintons. Do you not want the truth? Are you admitting to backing a liar crook? Sound like it to me!
@GOPChairwoman You need to run away from your leader. It will not end well!
@GovMikeHuckabee I am not sure you should really question someone about lying. Your daughter is the second biggest liar in the Country. Zip it!
@realJeffreyLord Remember how you criticized trump that time?? Me either!
@madams527 @GOPChairwoman I didn't have Twitter then. 😇
@GOPChairwoman And Trump hasn't condemned the killing of Jamal Khashoggi. I could type hypocrite everyday!
RT @TomiLahren: After tragedy there is often a knee jerk emotional reaction and push to take/give away our rights. This is a mistake. Give…
