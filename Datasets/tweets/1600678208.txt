@MissNyetTrump You can go to the Dental Hospital or clinics for a much reduced cost if you have a Healthcare card (ie on Centrelink) but still waiting list.
@MissNyetTrump @bostonsteve37 New Zealand doesn‚Äôt charge Medicare levy but more and more people have ‚Äúprivate‚Äù Health Insurance as the public system is bucking under weight of waiting lists.. I dare say they will move to an Australian system before too long..
@Sundrop76Marie @MissNyetTrump Yes I get that. However I still contend that if it are middle classed in the USA if you saw a Medicare system like Australia there is room to pay 2 cents in the dollar extra.

@siano2020 I weigh every opinion with logic, research and evidence. Those that I don‚Äôt find meets my standard I discard.
@BelindaJones68 @ScottMorrisonMP @jacindaardern Probably an excuse to get away for a bit.. I hope PM Ardern and imposter PM Morrison are discussing the future of #manus and #Nauru and the future of #ANZUS
@KamalaHarris Yes I am all of that but at the heart of it I am sad. Sad that #JessieSmollett would stoop so low to try and revive his career. Some people destroy their careers with drugs and alcohol, some with lies. I think we need to draw a line under this + not let it overshadow real victims
