@CaptKatyaSwann @1SnoozyQ @FranncescaRobi1 @AliAdair22 @MadelyneRants @WolfPAChq @RBReich @cenkuygur Very interesting how you all are fine with captain attacking me even congratulatory and family but I say wolf and several attack me at once. Thanks, learning a lot here.
@FranncescaRobi1 @1SnoozyQ @AliAdair22 @MadelyneRants @WolfPAChq @RBReich @cenkuygur I saw it as she was impugning on the integrity of someone who has done nothing but fight for truth and exposing administrations for years. I'm sorry for offending you all with my choice of words. I see those posts from trolls usually and am caught off guard it is a resister.
@1SnoozyQ @AliAdair22 @MadelyneRants @FranncescaRobi1 @WolfPAChq I believe the Constitution is our only hope with 45. I will defend it until death. I don't take this conversation lightly and am glad it is being talked about. I wish @RBReich &amp; @WolfPAChq @cenkuygur could get together for debate/talk. I respect both of their opinions greatly.
@imperatordort @YouTube take time to learn something or be gone.
@imperatordort @YouTube I don't push any agenda. I try to learn and do what is right. I thought the same way you're thinking until I remembered the Constitution.
@imperatordort @YouTube Exactly, they're already running it so if they could do it they would've already. Please check out the video. The Constitution and Article 5 are clear. https://t.co/mQ4x8xOn7R
@imperatordort @YouTube Who's enforcing the laws now? I don't back Koch either. Please check out the video where Cenk explains it well. https://t.co/mQ4x8xOn7R Article 5 is to PURPOSE Amendments. It must be ratified by 38 states. Only an Amendment both sides want would pass. Thus free and fair elections
@imperatordort @YouTube Simply not so. https://t.co/mQ4x8xOn7R
