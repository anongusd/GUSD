@MEPFuller eh, I'm lukewarm on that joke
You can't spell Highway Trust Fund without fun!
@evanblevine Very low, but we've been surprised before. Could get complicated if House stays in for a few days more, as rumors suggest
RT @FloorCharts: HEY FOOD TRUCKS - If Congress stays in, do yourself a favor and get over to Capitol Hill.
@evanblevine Indeed. DOT is set to cut highway reimbursements to states tomorrow w/o action.
@evanblevine No changes, banking on the Senate to blink and pass the original House bill. Down to the wire...
@evanblevine Yep, includes MAP policy and $11B in funds from "pension smoothing" and several other items
@evanblevine House just passed a patch through May 2015 and the expectation is the Senate will clear it this afternoon/evening.

I just misread a press release as "House Acts to Defund Constitution."
@evanblevine And on SAFETEA, it was back-dated and covered six years, but I see your point about only four in reality.
