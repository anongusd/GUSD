6/ If Dems dislike being called "socialist" they should stop working with socialists to push policies that radiate deep skepticism of market capitalism and undeserved confidence in government planning. And make sure your solution addresses an actual problem.
5/  Also odd: Dems cry “secular stagnation” with no good potential investments &amp; simultaneously argue companies need to make more investments. Are Dems arguing for companies to make unporfitable investments?
4/ It's also odd that many folks on the left are pushing for more business investment and higher wages while attacking the companies that are doing just that, like Big Tech.

@THAToneil I am less concerned that they publicize the trade-offs and costs than my suspicion that they are not even considering them or are even aware of them
So 70% top tax rates, wealth taxes, higher corporate taxes, and Congress telling companies how to invest. Zero consideration to possible trade-offs. "Nothing matters" as applied to policy.
But one of the arguments here is that companies are being pressured to underinvest and thus risk "the long-term strength of their companies." This argument is 40 years old! https://t.co/4L8pzOsx3e

@BlueLantern92 Wage growth would result from higher productivity growth coming from increased investment. Reducing the tax rate on a company’s taxable income gives it an incentive to earn more taxable income by expanding their factories, equipment, and other business capital.
Hey, fellow earthlings, let’s just memory hole this like we did the Navy pilots and their encounter with the UFO. 👽 https://t.co/7xLE9aMnmv
@BlueLantern92 I think these tax cuts are fueling growth. But the point of the business tax cuts, at least, was to promote investment and productivity growth, and increase the growth potential of the economy. Not quickie and ephemeral stimulus.

Trump’s urge to fire Fed Chair Powell is typical populism where a “savior” politician ignores the existence of any type of constraints on policy or action. (See the 1991 paper “The Macroeconomics of Populism,” by Dornbusch and Edwards)
