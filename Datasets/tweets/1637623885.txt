@LegalMaruchana @_Autumn_Tonic @WalshFreedom So what!! as long as she did it legally I dont give af if she got the benefit of a doubt.		You cant say that this was done illegally, thus meaning she came here legally 		Stop your hate, hate on trump instead
@LegalMaruchana @_Autumn_Tonic @WalshFreedom I dont see anything that says she cheated. This visa was approved, the visa is also not only given to nuclear scientists.		You are an idiot just trying to hate
