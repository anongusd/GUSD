I came out with a cream that works for psoriasis.
@MileyCyrus @MarkRonson @ellenvonunwerth Cute but no sound on my device.
@MarkTan23 I'm not afraid of flying, I am afraid of crashing and dying lol.
Meditation and aroma gold therapy events coming soon.
About my 24k 2 gold line of products these are multifunctional. Anti aging+ more and great for use on kids as well as adults. As a parent I wanted to come out with things I can use to help myself as well as my whole family while reducing what I have to carry... I did.
My 24k 2 gold rose blend face cream and  24k 2 gold rose blend body cream are now here see the gold being mixed in https://t.co/YniP74nJXC
My 24k 2 Gold Rose blend works on Psoriasis and relieves the itching fast to boot
@Lola_Bastinado No problem thank you for the response:)
@StrawberryRun27 Diet soda is really bad for you.
We will be eventually coming out with a scleroderma product line but this will take a while.
My products are Organic, Therapeutic Grade, Hand made, help with itchy skin, anti aging, immune boosting, help with eczema, psoriasis, cancer. They are awesome for children and adults. Do not use if you have scleroderma because they do help produce more collagen in the body.
@jobjenny @chrissyteigen I went through a time where foods had to be stuck in muffins and hidden it was like eat your orange to get your wheat grass kids, finish your rice and beans or whatever meaty or sea food dish to get your salads...
@BlueNarwhal26 @chrissyteigen Yes getting the kids involved is a good thing. Taking them shopping with you and having them help pick food- With guidance as well... Give them two or three choices but all choices are yours and don't let them know that so the child- children think they have their own choices.
@chrissyteigen Just keep trying new foods and have the reserve of what she likes... Mark it down when she eats new things, kids are funny... Mine love salad and my oldest washes off the dressing... He likes it plain. Salad is the reward system in my house... Opposite of what kids in the 90's.
@jessicaalba Yes! That is how it happens, I have my babies and now one of them is 6! I remember not being able to see my toes like it was yesterday and when he was small... Awesome days, congrats. Loved the baby diapers when he was small and the wipes but the wipes are not the same now.
@glenn_wellnitz But I also would not get my hopes up if in your shoes as it may not even be in her mind at this time to be with anyone and the tabloids may be full of it.
@glenn_wellnitz @jessicaalba Naturally because what straight guy is not interested in having a beautiful woman in his life at some point... A smart and successful woman that thousands also want. I wish you luck in life, you try.
I am mixing the cream I made in this video with the 2 types of gold. https://t.co/Ni0L00Msmo

@realDonaldTrump I saw the articals on Ca and the fires... I think I actually agreed with you on that one.
@realDonaldTrump Yet no elected official cares... They only pretend to care from what I have seen as it works to look good on them...
@itsgabrielleu @DwyaneWade Best wishes
@TheEllenShow By the way I hope I am using twitter correctly because I don't know how to message 1 on 1 here, sorry if not. Love the show.

The problem is the system is flawed and not everyone will help. I think that helping is the way to go and not caring enough is bad always kids espeshally need to have shelter, food, warm love, clothes and other needs ranging from toys, medical, dental, education... https://t.co/ym5AAMuDTj
You have to be very brave and prepared for the fact you may never see your loved ones again to go into this career in many places... Very scary stuff. My hats off to those who do this. Much love from all of us at Health Smell. https://t.co/sA9rSpSc6g
@NBCNews You have to be very brave and prepared for the fact you may never see your loved ones again to go into this career in many places... Very scary stuff. My hats off to those who do this. Much love from all of us at Health Smell.
Awe so cute, have to share this... https://t.co/reMAYeC8A7
Remember our products have essential oils in them so if they get left in heated areas and appear to seperate just toss them in the fridge for a bit and either shake or stirr them up... They do not have to be in the fridge to stay good.
Happy New Year
@jessicaalba Very Merry
I only test on people, not animals and my products have proven themselves. I have years of knowledge behind me even tho the company's a baby so to speak. Best wishes, Dr. O.
@KimKardashian Oh also there is an amazing dermatologist I know here in Ny, Dr. Morris Westfried. My family went to him until we moved. He's very good.
@KimKardashian I use my own products with the whole family including babies on up to my mother:) I hope this helps, I did not mean to tweet so much but I find helping others important. Happy holidays.
@KimKardashian Health Smell products are all safe for eczema, psoriasis, babies and adults. Age effect reduction is another plus with my products and the aromas are mild, natural and non agitating to the skin.
@KimKardashian I use organic, therapeutic grade, natural ingredients and I make all the skin products by hand. Aroma therapy and other soothing options with the use of aroma, metals such as gold. For Feb there will be a special 24k 2 gold aroma cream coming out.
@KimKardashian If you have questions I can also answer those gladly healthsmell@gmail.com
@KimKardashian I can help you with this issue. If you contact me I can tailor a blend to assist your skin and reduce these issues with out putting the meds into your body.
