Hopping a fence or border does not make one a U.S. Citizen.

America had many people in poverty too, #Democrats. Maybe they ought to find ways in legislation to help the suffering Americans with actual citizenship RATHER than doing everything they can to get illegal future Democratic votes by putting illegals over citizens. #AmericaFirst

Eight in 10 executives said tax reform has allowed them to make investments that weren't possible in the past, according to a new study from PwC, which polled 404 c-suite leaders. Seventy-eight percent of respondents said the new law has made business in the U.S. more attractive.

No better way to “pass” the time than to reflect and enjoy our Jewish freedoms from tyranny and slavery. Happy Passover to all my followers or Jewish faith! 🇮🇱 #Passover https://t.co/AhiCrvMGJg
Passover or Pesach, is an important, biblically derived Jewish holiday. Jews celebrate Passover as a commemoration of their liberation by God from slavery in ancient Egypt and their freedom as a nation under the leadership of Moses. Literally thank God!
Passover affirms the great truth that liberty is the inalienable right of every human being.
Happy Passover! Passover is the major Jewish festival that commemorates the liberation of the Israelites from Egyptian slavery, lasting seven or eight days from the 15th day of Nisan.
RT @BillOReilly: Here’s the Tip of the Day: if you know someone who lives alone, invite them over for dinner on Easter or during Passover.
