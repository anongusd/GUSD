Reminder: Our season finale airs tonight at 11:02 on HBO, and it’s packed with 40 minutes of surprises…as long as you have no idea what happened last week.
Despite the number of last weeks still to come, tonight's episode will be our final show of 2018. Please join us tonight at 11:02 and then wait very patiently until next year.

Sorry about that errant “turn on HBO now” tweet. Mitch, our social media intern, has been gently chastised for the mistake.

Are you ready for a new episode of Last Week Tonight? We hope not! Because it’s going to be another three minutes before it starts on HBO.
Reminder: We return to HBO tonight at 11:03. So you only have a few more hours to lament (or celebrate) the fact that we are not currently on TV.
We've got a new episode tonight at 11:03, so clear your schedules. And then put "Watch Last Week Tonight" on your schedules. It doesn't help if you just do the clearing part.
We're back tonight at 11:03 on HBO, bringing our number of consecutive weeks with new episodes up to an impressive: 1.
We were off last week. But tomorrow night at 11:03, we’re back on HBO for good…or at least for thirty minutes.
We're back this Sunday night at 11:03 on HBO. Unlike when a friend says they're "running three minutes behind" we promise to be only three minutes late for real.
We’re off this week, but we’ll be back next week. Go to bed early tonight. You’ve got a big day tomorrow, we assume.

Reminder: We’ll be back on HBO this evening at 11:05, squeezing a large amount of last week into a small amount of tonight.
Reminder: We're back this Sunday at 11:05. That extra five minutes of waiting will only make our hearts grow fonder. Okay, and slightly sleepier too.
We're back this Sunday night on @HBO. Our new episode will air at 11:05 this week, because we can't do anything the easy way.

Reminder: Tonight’s show will be forty minutes long, so please don't reflexively turn it off after thirty minutes because you will miss 25% of the episode.

Get ready to experience the recent past in the near future! Turn on HBO in 17 minutes for a new episode of Last Week Tonight.
We’re back on HBO tonight at 11:17. It’s our last show until May 6th, so let’s savor (or at least…spend) this evening together.
Our show starts 17 minutes late tonight, but we assume you knew that and have planned your weekends in preparation.
We're back on Sunday night at 11:17. This is not a joke, although that is kind of a funny time to start a thing.

Hey, @blockbuster! Come and get it! https://t.co/C8Cd85pWD8
East coast: Join us now on HBO! It's probably not worse than what you'd be doing otherwise...unless you had something really cool planned.
Only two short hours until we’re on HBO! (We feel obligated to clarify that those hours will not actually be any shorter than usual.)
We’re back on HBO tonight at 11 with our third consecutive  episode. We hope you’re not too intimidated by our stamina.
Every this week eventually becomes a last week, and this this week is no exception. We’ll cover it Sunday night at 11 on HBO.

If you enjoy waiting for things to start, then you will love the next 3 minutes! (We don’t start until 11:03.)
Just a few hours until tonight's Last Week Tonight. Spend them wisely. Or squander them completely. It's Sunday. You owe nothing to anyone.
We're back tonight on @HBO from 11:03 to 11:38. We like to keep 'em guessing.
Sunday night’s show will start at 11:03 and run for 35 minutes. We apologize for this blatant disregard for your bedtime.
We’ll be on HBO again this Sunday night. It’s our second new episode in a row, which we believe should count for something.

Tonight’s show will start at 11 and run for thirty minutes on HBO. It doesn’t get more “Last Week Tonight” than that! Classic us.
We're back on @HBO tonight at 11, squeezing an entire week into thirty minutes, as is our custom.
Our excitement to be back on HBO this Sunday night is tempered by our growing suspicion that you didn’t even notice we were gone.
We’re back this Sunday night. That is not an April Fools’ Day prank. (It would be a bad joke and people would be mad at us for it.)
There’s no new Last Week Tonight tonight, but our most recent episode will re-air at 11:03, so you can relive all the magic of last week.

Are you ready for Last Week Tonight? That’s a rhetorical question because either way it starts right now on HBO and runs until 11:35.
Reminder: Tonight’s show will be 5 minutes longer than usual. It’s our small act of rebellion against clocks after what they did to us last night.
We're back in just a few hours on @HBO. Prepare to enjoy (or avoid) tonight's 35-mimnute episode accordingly.
BIG NEWS: We’re back on HBO tonight at 11 and will be 35 minutes long!	(Technically, this is just "slightly larger than usual" news.)

A new Last Week Tonight episode starts on HBO in exactly 3 hours and 3 minutes! Well, now it’s slightly less than that! Now it’s even less!
We’re on tonight at 11:03. It’s our third week in a row with a new episode. Truly, our endurance is unparalleled.
Reminder: Tomorrow's episode will start 3 minutes later than usual, but trust us, it will start.
Predictably, there’s a new episode of our show this Sunday on HBO. Less predictably, it starts at 11:03. See? We're very spontaneous!
It has come to our attention that this week will eventually become last week. We will therefore discuss it Sunday night on @HBO.

We have a new episode at 11:03 on HBO! We mention it because we thought maybe you’d like to watch. We hope we haven't been too forward.
Tonight's show will begin at 11:03, and it will run a few minutes longer than usual because, well, everything's been kind of a lot lately.
Last week is in the recent past, but this week's Last Week Tonight is in the near future…tonight at 11:03, to be exact.
Join us tonight at 11:03 on HBO for a brand new episode. We promise to try to make it worth the extra three minutes of waiting.
This Sunday night on HBO, we’ll discuss this week which is really just next week’s last week.

RT @iamjohnoliver: We're back! We have a brand new @LastWeekTonight for you at 11:08. Not 11:07. Certainly not 11:09. 11:08. The perfect no…
Tonight's show starts at 11:08 and ends at 11:40. We do not mean to keep messing with you like this. We just can't let anyone get close.
Tonight's episode starts at 11 and runs until 11:32. We are sorry for this inconvenient amount of bonus last week.
We're back with a new episode tonight at 11 on @HBO. We missed you all. Except you, Greg. Get your life together, man.
We've got a new episode tonight. Until then we will be frantically trying to catch up on the past four weeks of events.
Sunday night will be our first show in a while, and it might be a little tight cramming all those last weeks into thirty minutes.
We're back next Sunday night at 11. This Sunday night at 11 we're...un-back? There has to be a better word for that, but we're a bit rusty.
No new show this Sunday. Not a big deal. It's been a pretty uneventful week.
We were off last night, and we're off this Sunday too. You will have to figure out something else to enjoy on @HBO instead.

Despite the amount of week happening already this week, there will be no new Last Week Tonight on Sunday.
We're off tonight (and for the next two Sundays as well). See you back on @HBO on the 30th.
There's no new Last Week Tonight tonight. That does not mean that there was no last week. We assure you, there was.
