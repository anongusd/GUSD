@TDPattillo @RepSwalwell Oh brilliant!😂
@marcorubio You are my Senator and you are sickening me.
@Cathy86453339 @jennycohn1 And it doesn't make sense to me that the restoration of voting rights was passed and yet both Gov and Senate went GOP.
@BlueGhost40_ @AnnCoulter Ann, you're so full of hatred.  Do you ever have any fun?
@ResisterSis20 Thank you.  I was new to this and didn't even know there was a limit til I actually hit it.  Have been trying to whittle it down so appreciate the advice.
@PamKeithFL We are never going to change the minds of his base so we have to make sure there are more of us than them.  I hate this us and them stuff but it's the world we live in.

@McFaul And we loved him.
@ShuttleCDRKelly @StationCDRKelly We don't care.  We will take either one of you or better yet..both.
@OFemmeFataleZ River Street.  Just beautiful.
@renato_mariotti When Trump announced he was running, was he seriously seeking the office or was it just a publicity stunt that went awry.
@tribelaw @Carmen23379700 You brought me down off the ceiling.
@ImJohnEli Ask any 65 year old if they like their Medicare.  You bet we do!

@chrislhayes But please, point out your differences but don't bad mouth each other and give Republicans ammunition.
@GovHowardDean Please people, don't say anything about each other that can be used by Republicans.
@MollyJongFast Too perfect!
@olivia_rayy So sweet.
@dodo Bless you.
@GManfan64 @shannonrwatts Trying to point out she had a place to go and people to help and these souls do not.
@jpodhoretz Maybe it's you, not us.
@shannonrwatts Having to move to escape danger........reminds me of the folks south of the border doing the same.
@sam_vinograd @CNN Taxpayers should not be on the hook for it.
@grammarox @TheRickWilson @POTUS You seem to be a very angry human being.
@TheRickyDavila It makes me sad that the president hates me just because I'm a Democrat.
@kylegriffin1 Oh, this is going to get him riled up.
@krassenstein Yes!  I am tired of being labeled the enemy just because I am a Democrat.
@thehill I love these people.
@donnabrazile I'm  sad that the President of my country thinks I'm a disgrace because I am a Democrat.
@brithume So, Brit, do you think he had bone spurs?
@joncoopertweets Shows how out of touch with the rest of us these people are.
@dodo @RealKellyJones Beautiful.  Thank you.
@StevenBeschloss Taxpayers shouldn't be paying for these trips that are nothing more than political rallies that feed his fragile ego.
@jpodhoretz You seem to have a really poor opinion of people.

@hilaryr @CNN @realDonaldTrump Everybody.
@shannonrwatts Ya know,  he is unfortunately president of all of us, not just republicans.  I'm really sick of being called a disgrace by him.
@abbydphillip It's so upsetting to not believe anything out of his mouth.  I don't even give him the benefit of the doubt I just assume everything is a lie.

@realDonaldTrump Ok.  Be specific.  Exactly how is America with them?
@JWisPolitical @krassenstein How about Senate?  Why didn't they stay and try to work it out.
@krassenstein Why was Congress allowed to adjourn.  They should have stayed through holidays to try and fix this.

@davidhogg111 I hope to be able to vote for you someday.
@StevenBeschloss Are our taxes paying him?
@CuomoPrimeTime Nope, Trump's wall.
@McFaul Good to remember the days when there was something to be happy about.
@mschlapp Well, many of you should be ashamed.

@realDonaldTrump I don't think so.
@MikeLupica Magnificent!
@samstein I'm a homemaker in Florida, not a lawyer, not an economist, not a lawmaker, but this just feels like a big bowl of wrong.
