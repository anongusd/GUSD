DYK that not only was “You’ll Lose a Good Thing” Barbara Lynn’s first single back in 1962, but it made it to #1 on the US R&amp;B Chart and #8 on the pop chart. It was also covered by Aretha Franklin. #NEAHeritage18
"I started playing by listening to the radio a lot, listening to the blues when I was a very young girl." -- Barbara Lynn #NEAHeritage18
Our final honoree tonight is R&amp;B musician Barbara Lynn. Read more about her here: https://t.co/0PFGjVSQPn #NEAHeritage18
Ofelia Esparza is inspired to make altars because "the final death of a person is to be forgotten" and her work is an antidote to that. #NEAHeritage18
Ofelia Esparza: Everything in an altar represents earth, light, wind, and water. "There's always a glass of water because my mother said the soul visits us from such a long journey, it's always thirsty." #NEAHeritage18
It's inspiring to listen to Marion Coleman, Feryal Abbasi-Ghnaim, Kelly Church, and now Ofelia Esparza all talk about the generational + personal stories they tell through the work of their hands. #NEAHeritage18
DYK Ofelia Esparza and her daughter Rosanna were part of the advisory team that helped the filmmakers behind @pixarcoco present Day of the Dead traditions authentically? #NEAHeritage18
Our next Heritage Fellow is Chicana altarista, or Day of the Dead altarmaker, Ofelia Esparza. Here’s our podcast with her: https://t.co/dnmuKzHJeB #NEAHeritage18

DYK Heritage Fellow Kelly Church, an Anishinabe Black Ash Basketmaker, comes from the largest family of basketmakers in Michigan? Learn more about her here: https://t.co/KaTq1SfZdE #NEAHeritage18
Here's more from Feryal Abbasi-Ghnaim in this video tribute: https://t.co/JNkxAQBn6f #NEAHeritage18
The embroidery in the panels refer to information like recipes, wedding traditions, group dances, etc. #NEAHeritage18
Feryal Abbasi-Ghnaim explains that many of the Palestinian women in older generations were illiterate. The embroidery was their form of communication. #NEAHeritage18
"I feel the embroidery is part of me. Embroidery is teaching the generations something. It belongs to history, to geography. It describes the environment of our homeland." -- Feryal Abbasi-Ghnaim #NEAHeritage18
Our next Heritage Fellow is Palestinian embroiderer Feryal Abbasi-Ghnaim. Learn more about her here: https://t.co/p1doeYDlUW  #NEAHeritage18

NBD--just a partial list of Manuel Cuevas' clients: "Elvis. The Jackson 5. Johnny Cash. Dolly Parton. Loretta Lynn. Neil Young. David Bowie. The King of Morocoo. Lady Gaga. Martha Gonzalez. And four different US presidents. Flaco Jimenez. Del McCoury." #NEAHeritage18
Manuel Cuevas on starting to design in his signature style: "I was bored with straight suits. They all looked like mortician suits to me. I never had ambition when I was young to be a designer. It was a calling." #NEAHeritage18
Manuel Cuevas started sewing because his brother needed help with his business. "I sat behind that machine and I'm still sitting more than 75 years later!" #NEAHeritage18 @ManuelCouture

"I think the sky's the limit with quilting!" -- Marion Coleman #NEAHeritage18
Coleman's quilts explore both her personal history and the history of African-Americans in the US. They sometimes incorporate designs based on historic documents and photos she borrows from museums. #NEAHeritage18
The image gracing the cover of this year’s concert program is Marion Coleman's quilt honoring #NEAJazzMaster Dee Dee Bridgewater.  #NEAHeritage18 https://t.co/CpjxotgNMI

There's still time to join us in Room 145 for our chat with @HeidErdrich and Jennifer Foerster about Native poetry and poets. #NatBookFest https://t.co/69yqDOSuUV
"New Poets of Native Nations" is a first step in changing the way the literary world responds to literature by people of Native nations. The tendency is to lump them together and not include them in the history of American literature. -- Jennifer Foerster #NatBookFest
Acc to @HeidErdrich "New Poets of Native Nations" arose because of a question someone asked online, "Who are the Native Poets I should be reading?" And there hadn't been a literary book about Native poets. #natbookfest
"I don't believe 'Native American' poetry is a thing. It's just a term we use to bring the original peoples of this land together." -- @HeidErdrich (Ojibwe)
"I remember ivy trembling at the vanishing point of your throat, then the timelines crashed..." -- from a poem from #NEALitFellow Jennifer Foerster's book "Bright Raft in the Afterweather"
From "Canyon" by Jennifer Foerster:		"A line of dust divides us, narwhal and ghost..."
