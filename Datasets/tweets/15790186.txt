@CurtJester At our TLM, they were smart enough to just have a letter read from the pulpit. Sounded like business as usual, which was pretty dense on the diocese's part. Almost no one filled out the envelope. Hoping the jerks take a major hit.

@MZHemingway Yep. It's also a sign of continuity with the Eastern Churches, which have their own version which somehow involves cheese.
@MZHemingway We celebrated it today at my Traditional Latin Mass. Also, Catholics in the Anglican Ordinariate have it. But the other 99 percent don’t. The new calendar foolishly got rid of the entire Septuagesima season. Another fruit of the rotten Uncle Ted Second Vatican Council.

@tomdryan @RameshPonnuru @NRO Refundable credits higher. AMT de facto repealed. Child tax credits doubled and nearly universal. 199A small biz deduction. Retroactive tax extenders. Retroactive technical corrections. Hard for refunds NOT to be same or higher with all those tailwinds. (2/2)
@tomdryan @RameshPonnuru @NRO The data might still fluctuate from here, but I remain confident (as I have since this whole fake news started) that the average refund (the exclusive MSM metric up until this week) will be the same or higher than last tax season. There are several good reasons for this. (1/2)

@NKaeding Ag tariffs are for wimps
@GS_Watson @taxfoundation As a preparer, I have found 1099-K in general to be problematic. Wouldn't one solution be for the bigger gig economy companies to voluntarily agree to 1099-MISC in lieu of 1099-K? That lowers the threshold to $600 and is more straightforward for tax filing.

@WilliamPatriots I'm of a mind on safeties that we need a day one or day two pick and we need to bring everyone back. When you have a base 4-2-5 you can't have enough--that nickel guy is often times a safety. We're getting long in the tooth there.
@WilliamPatriots Your logic makes more sense for a high cap figure guy like Dwayne Allen (not a roster lock) than for D-Mac or Hightower (roster locks). I'd much rather have the flexibility on Allen. But the other two are foundation pieces of the defense in 2019 with cap charges we can spread out
@WilliamPatriots The only reason not to is if they plan on cutting or trading him between now and Week 1. If he's a surefire roster lock, that's a no brainer for both sides. D-Mac gets most of his money now instead of in gamechecks, and Pats get a $4 million cap relief/dead money transfer.
@WilliamPatriots Why not give him a one year extension with minimum salary this year and next, and the rest of the $9.5 million as a signing bonus? Would allow maybe $4 million of cap hit spread into next year.

@JZmirak I don’t see the substantive difference between overturning Roe and expanding Casey to let states regulate abortion freely. It’s the same legal outcome.
@CamperWatcher27 @RichardRubinDC @pragmatometer @asymmetricinfo @taxfoundation Yes but my point is that the biggest SALT whiners tend to be rich blue state guys who lost all but $10k of their SALT and didn’t get a rate cut because all their income is cap gains and dividends. NIIT repeal was always supposed to be part of the deal.
@CamperWatcher27 @RichardRubinDC @pragmatometer @asymmetricinfo @taxfoundation Paying the AMT now is akin to dying in an airplane crash or winning the lottery.
@CamperWatcher27 @pragmatometer @RichardRubinDC @asymmetricinfo @taxfoundation Yes. And before drawing that pension.

@RichardRubinDC @pragmatometer @asymmetricinfo @taxfoundation If their pay for was (say) a 28 percent cap gains rate, I think we might see a very big drop off in SALT whining. The rich guys who complain about SALT, as you’ve pointed out, don’t face ordinary rate taxation on most of their income.
@pragmatometer @RichardRubinDC @asymmetricinfo @taxfoundation When these blue state Dem governors/Congressmen/Senators say they want SALT back where it was before, I wish reporters would ask “do you want the AMT back, too?”
@pragmatometer @RichardRubinDC @asymmetricinfo @taxfoundation It wasn’t much of a regional adjustment mechanism for the 5 million SALT claimants with $0 SALT deduction because of the AMT. It more so is now since those 5 million families saw their allowable SALT rise from $0 to $10,000 under TCJA.

@SteveSkojec That’s a monumentally stupid take. It was a 60 vote process.
Doing a SALT analysis without accounting for the fact the AMT had a $0 SALT deduction is peak irresponsible tax research.

@bdquinn @ScottElliotG I’m thinking of those post $110k AGI families who had a declining or $0 CTC and now have a $2k CTC. Also AMT folks with no dependent exemptions at all.
@ScottElliotG reporters don't seem to get that the $2000 CTC is way, way bigger than the $4050 dependent exemption.

@DrKC4 @KatiePavlich @BrianJohnsonMPA that's like calling an election with 10 percent of the precincts in. wait for more data.
@kpomerleau I will admit I didn’t think we were going to go from 8 to 17 percent down. That’s a kick in the balls. But I just got efile opened up for my (mostly self employed) clients last week. Software companies delayed, too. Huge 199A/AMT/CTC refunds for them.
@kpomerleau It’s now a significant YTD drop, but I’m still not worried. The more complex filers (on both ends of the income spectrum) are going to get large refund windfalls, and they have yet to be reflected in the data. Still Joe and Jane TurboTax so far. AMT, CTC, ACTC, 199A, to go.
@jimtankersley Correct. The refundable credit issue makes this an apple and an orange. Everything is happening later this year. I’m still confident in my prediction.

@WilliamGale2 @kpomerleau It’s not the sole metric but it’s part of the story. If the share of total taxes paid by millionaires fell, you certainly would be using that metric to argue “tax cuts for the rich.” It’s only omitted because it doesn’t fit the Left’s narrative, not because it’s inherently bad.
@kpomerleau @WilliamGale2 @MarcGoldwein @SquawkCNBC I’m willing to live with dollar share metrics, avg eff rate metrics, etc. But this metric is also part of the story and it’s never mentioned, on purpose.

@AlexParkerDC @MidnightsEdge if all parallel universes are canon, then Sulu can be both gay and straight, depending on the universe.
@AlexParkerDC Not according to CBS. There is the canonical universe (The Cage through ENT All Good Things), the Kelvin universe (the JJ movies), and Kelvin’s prime universe (the first act of JJ Trek and Discovery). It sucks but that’s where the franchise is right now. @MidnightsEdge has it all
@AlexParkerDC 100 percent of the evidence we have in the canonical universe (1965 to 2005) is that Hulu is straight. The best evidence is his daughter in Generations. The second best evidence is his Mirror self hitting on Uhura. There is zero evidence of his being gay anywhere in canon.
@AlexParkerDC Only in the Kelvin universe is Sulu gay. And the Kelvin universe is not canonical. See Midnight’s Edge on YouTube here. If you disagree, remember that Sulu was born after the Kelvin timeline disruption, and might have different genetics as a result.
@AlexParkerDC What evidence is there in the episode that it’s an act? Remember you can’t use the actor’s sexual characteristics as an argument unless we want to talk about gay Kelvin Spock.
@johnkartch It would help if our own Treasury Dept was on-message.

@ScottElliotG maybe we have the same $3000 loss rule as today, and suspended losses are indexed year to year by that year's 1 year Treasury rate. like indexed cost recovery for structures would work.
@ScottElliotG So it's the calendar year accrued gain, less the 1 year Treasury note rate as of a date certain? Makes sense for publicly traded securities. Losses carry forward?
@ScottElliotG And the normal return is calculated how? The concept of super-normal and normal returns makes sense in tax theory, but strikes me as the 21st century version of imputed rent--the public will never get it.

@danieljmitchell @RepAOC @SenSanders well, that certainly wasn't my intention. my preference is for a tax code which is more progressive. but it should do so while not crossing any pro-growth lines nor while raising any net new revenue. within a tax-only bill, more progressive taxes should finance pro-growth cuts.

@RyanHannable That $21 million is his cap hit with the Giants, which includes his bonus pro-ration. Any team trading for him would only be liable for his salary. Should be more like $15 million or so if the Pats get him. Giants would have to cap charge any un-prorated bonus.

@mboorstein Pope Francis has reiterated the constant discipline of the Church that men with same sex attraction have no place in the priesthood. They are not to be admitted to seminary. They are not to be ordained. They are not to be kept in active ministry. They are unfit.
@jdflynn @holysmoke @Pope_news I can’t believe two thirds of our bishops, including my supposedly conservative bishop, voted against urging this very thing.
@EWErickson The Church has been very clear, up to and including Pope Francis himself in fact, that men with same sex attraction are unfit for the priesthood and are not to be admitted to the seminary, ordained, or kept in ministry. Some pretend this isn’t the case but it is.

@EnsellJudith @USCCB there is no "teaching" on refugees at the policy level, only at the moral imperative level. there can't be a teaching at the policy level, because there is a range of acceptable Catholic answers here.

@saquin i'm curious how a middle class taxpayer (i'd say $30k to $200k or so probably qualifies) has a tax increase with lower rates, a doubled standard deduction, a $2000 child credit, no AMT, and a 199A windfall. all because SALT $10k and exemptions? I seriously doubt it.
@saquin Show your math.
@saquin Middle class people got big tax cuts.
@AStrickland5 @R_Thaler so do i. as a tax preparer, you must know that the AMT windfall returns, 199A returns, and child tax credit returns are mostly yet to come.

@qorbono @mbayer1248 It might surprise you guys to learn that I worked on behalf of comprehensive immigration reform in the mid 2000s. It’s a complex issue that doesn’t lend itself to hashtag resist open borders and amnesty rhetoric posing as Catholicism.
@qorbono @mbayer1248 Doctrine develops, but never into corruption. “Where were you when I was a stranger?” is in the deposit of faith. The three legs balance that and other competing doctrinal demands like obeying just laws. We’re not Prots. We don’t read the Bible and proclaim private revelation.
@brendanmdunn Imagine if we lived in a world where reporters, even once, wrote about the other 95 percent.
@mboorstein @jdflynn @EdwardPentin Bishop Burbidge of Arlington admitted he voted against this and you ought to ask him why.
@MichaelRStrain Not a demotion to lay. A restriction on using his clerical state.
@qorbono @mbayer1248 The Church seeks to strike a balance between openness to immigration, strong immigration laws, and immigrant respect for those laws. The over-emphasis on the first leg unbalances the three legged stool. Execution of the principles is where lay prudential judgment comes in.

@PFeeneyND @mbayer1248 READ THE CATECHISM
@mbayer1248 How else are you supposed to effectuate welcoming the stranger, using laws to do so, and having the immigrants respect those laws? There’s no moral judgment here. It’s good people disagreeing on prudential application.
@mbayer1248 The Church’s teaching is what the Church has always taught, everywhere.
@mbayer1248 The question is what the Church teaches, not what you think Jesus said or what recent popes have said.  We are to welcome the foreigner. We can set laws. They must obey those laws. That’s all prudential judgement.
@mbayer1248 Are you saying that your interpretation of Jesus trumps the Church’s as expressed in the Catechism? C’mon, man. We’re not a private interpretation religion.
@JaredWalczak I’ll try not to spike the football too hard when I win

@RichardRubinDC @Brian_Riedl @tristan_shout @jimtankersley Same guys then responded by trying to fit a 199A square peg into a SSB round hole. Lots of them did benefit from real estate provisions, though.
@RichardRubinDC @Brian_Riedl @tristan_shout @jimtankersley A lot of the rich guys in New York upset about SALT get most of their income on cap gains and dividends. They are post-AMT. No rate cut b/c we screwed up NIIT Obamacare repeal. But full brunt of $10k SALT limit. NIIT was missing piece for them. But these are uber rich donors.
@Brian_Riedl @tristan_shout @jimtankersley the least publicized stat from the TCJA
@laurapdavison @RichardRubinDC @jimtankersley @BruceBartlett the big windfalls outside of lower tax rates and a higher standard deduction: the AMT de facto repeal windfall, the 199A windfall, and the doubled child credit windfall. none of those are likely accounted for in more generous withholding tables, which is mostly about rates.
@laurapdavison @RichardRubinDC @jimtankersley @BruceBartlett the 110 percent estimated payment rule will be one of the main reasons that refunds won't be down. not just the 199A windfall. also the rate cut windfall.

@AndrewNehring @allahpundit the other thing Never Trump doesn't get is that it's not only those three things. it's also all the things that Hillary DIDN'T get to do.
@AndrewNehring @allahpundit i would have loved to put Obamacare repeal as number 3 on that list, but the policy purity caucus wouldn't let it happen.
@AndrewNehring @allahpundit 1. judges/life issues	2. TCJA	3. regs that manage to stick		in that order. worth it.
@AndrewNehring @allahpundit it's almost baked into the cake that 25 percent of the judges will be Trump judges. what does that turn into in a second term? i don't think it's half, but what? 40 percent? not bad.
@AndrewNehring @allahpundit gonna guess WH is going to methodically do this in batches. do background checks, send to judiciary, mark up, do 2 hours on the floor, confirm. like a machine. maybe a dozen noms at a time.
@AndrewNehring @allahpundit a bunch just got reported out of SJC. like 41 I think. There are 124 district and 12 circuit court vacancies. if the Lankford plan to reduce district noms to 2 hours of debate goes through, time will not be an issue. we just have to send up the noms in time.
@danieldbunn @taxfoundation Pillar 3 seems like the most sensible way to do it, though I'm very skeptical of "economic nexus" tests as too eye-of-the-beholder.
@1947Farmall part of a tax code that encourages local production is a tax code that encourages..production. step one is a consumption base neutral approach on business fixed investment, i.e. full expensing. step two is low, competitive rates on capital and profit.
@1947Farmall much of this is that politics is downstream from culture. we can't use a smaller lever (politics) to move a big rock (culture), at least not much. but we can at least try to align politics so that it supports families and economic growth, not just big companies and consumerism.
@AndrewNehring @allahpundit i ran the numbers. trump is going to have appointed 25 percent of the district court judges, 25 percent of the circuit court judges, and 22-44 percent of the SCOTUS judges (depending), all during his first term.  he's basically replaced all the Clinton appointees, is my guess.

@IngrahamAngle @JZmirak @realDonaldTrump Shutdowns don't work.
@ahrferrier For example, why does our tax code give a deduction on interest on $750,000 McMansions (down from $1 million thanks to TCJA), but does not provide FICA tax relief for parents who have four or more kids? Small example, but shows how the deck is stacked against red staters.
@AmericanPapist three guesses who the "source in the room" is.
@kerpen funny how SSM oppo and oppo to women in combat is written as totally extreme in here when a majority of democrats would have agreed with that as recently as a decade ago. they have gone insane as a party and have no home for anyone but wackjob liberals.
@ahrferrier It's objectively worse to go from nearly everyone having that option to only the elite having that option. In America, families should have a choice based on what Moms and Dads want to do. They don't anymore, and they used to.
@RaymondArroyo I think we should all start going exclusively to TLMs on Sundays and Holy Days of obligation.
@holysmoke night night baby
@holysmoke tell the truth. every time.
@RadicalCath @BishopofJoliet @Church_Militant @Michael_Voris @ProtecttheFaith straight up heresy
@1947Farmall No such thing as passive shareholding. Investors give companies money when they buy stock. Companies use that money to invest in themselves and pay workers. Every dollar of wage began as a dollar of investment.
@realchrismanion Sounds about right. The big problem is that policy can only do so much. Corporate America has to be willing to pay a family wage to fathers with kids. And they are nowhere near culturally ready to do that. Quite the opposite.
@padrebrendon Yet another reason the traditional calendar is superior. By the way, the @USCCB has the authority to make a USA calendar change to restore Feb 14 as St Valentine’s Day and never has. Too busy virtue signaling on amnesty.
@1947Farmall At the same time, we should remember that family income is a product of a fast growing, productive economy. We need things like full business expensing, competitive tax rates on companies, lower taxes on shareholders, etc. Soak the rich and corporate tax welfare to pay for it.
@1947Farmall Part of this needs to be an end to the mortgage interest and SALT deductions, combined with lower FICA taxes, a bigger standard deduction, and bigger (non-refundable) child credits. Revenue neutral swap to help working families.
@1947Farmall I don’t think there’s a policy only answer. This is a complex societal failure for which large corporations, the sexual revolution, and the collapse of civil society bear a lot of the blame. But conservative policy can and should help.
We’re richer than ever, but only the elite can earn enough money for the man to work and the wife to stay home with the kids, something easily done two generations ago. The conservative policy agenda has to come to grips with this clear market failure.  https://t.co/j620ScFI1Q
@derekahunter Shutdowns don’t work.
@RichardRubinDC @KateDavidson Correct. The baseline is 2017 x 1*NGDP growth. That tells you the tax cut from baseline.
@KateDavidson Another way to look at this: tax revenues come in at 99.6 percent of prior year level despite massive tax cut. But there’s no liberal media bias or anything.
@MDuppler I’m a bigger SALT dork than you but I’m also basically Pitbull so it fits.

@taxtweet @ronlieber @tarasbernard How many Manhattan residents making $200k to $400k were NOT in the AMT? It’s a very very high number that were. For each of those folks, their SALT deduction was $0 and is now $10,000. You can nitpick all you want but your story misled readers.
@tarasbernard @taxtweet @ronlieber SALT analysis - AMT analysis = clickbait
@tarasbernard @taxtweet @ronlieber Anyone in NYC deducting SALT and earning between $200k and $400k was in the AMT, period. Which means $0 SALT. Without adding that context to a SALT analysis, the reader is left to conclude that the SALT cap was a big hit on these taxpayers. In fact, it was a windfall for them.
@kpomerleau @MarcGoldwein Essentially that’s a two rate structure: mid20s and mid30s.
@kpomerleau @MarcGoldwein I think it would be odd for the Left to back into 25-27-37-39-36-39-41 labor marginal rate structure.
@kpomerleau @MarcGoldwein I should have been more specific. I’m referring to the relative progressivity of marginal tax rates on labor. The income rates get into the 30s as the payroll rate goes down to 3.8. Raising the cap (but not eliminating it) means a pretty flat marginal tax rate on labor. 35-40.
@MarcGoldwein My concern about increasing the cap is that you would have top end tax rates on merely affluent workers. Essentially a 35-40 percent near flat tax for everyone making more than $125k or so. Hurts progressivity.

@bstonercpa @HartmanTax @KamalaHarris @TaxPolicyCenter @taxfoundation @jctgov That is likely to be the case the simpler the taxpayer's situation is. Simple people file early, hence the data noise.
@MDuppler I put some hot sauce in my low carb breakfast this morning, let me tell you.
@MorganStanley (Fin) Where are the fact checkers on this? Do any reporters who emphasized the early filing season data and buried the @MorganStanley report in paragraph 23 feel the need to educate readers a little better on this? They should. https://t.co/EMwClrOUjS
(10) to put a cherry on top of the whole thing, we have a study from @MorganStanley which estimates that total refunds will be UP by 26 percent by the end of tax season, a total of $62 billion (with a "b"). Refunds will most likely end up higher. https://t.co/EMwClrOUjS
@TaxPolicyCenter @taxfoundation (9) the people yet to file are the ones who will get refund windfalls: AMT payers, parents, people with side hustles, people waiting for retroactive tax extenders and technical corrections, refundable credit low income folks, etc. https://t.co/EMwClrOUjS
@TaxPolicyCenter @taxfoundation (8) the people who have filed already are people who only have W-2 wage income, and are either single or DINKs, and who rent. In other words, people who are most likely to have gotten their tax cut in bigger paydays, not bigger refunds. https://t.co/EMwClrOUjS
The @TaxPolicyCenter says the average tax cut in the #taxcutsandjobsact is $2100 per year. @taxfoundation says middle class after tax income is up 1.7 percent. These are not small tax cuts, but large ones. https://t.co/EMwClrOUjS
(6) The middle class got their rates cut (15 and 25 brackets are now 12 and 22 brackets), their standard deduction doubled ($24k for a married couple), their child tax credit doubled to $2000 per child (and now available to almost everyone), AMT gone, etc https://t.co/EMwClrOUjS
(5) The IRS lowered the amount they take out of our paychecks to reflect the lower tax rates we're all now paying. Thus, for many people the bulk of their tax cut was received every payday. https://t.co/EMwClrOUjS
(4) To state the obvious, a tax refund tells you nothing about your tax liability. A tax refund just means you gave an interest free loan to the IRS by overpaying your taxes all year. Refunds go up and down for many reasons. https://t.co/EMwClrOUjS
(3) It's very early in filing season. Making a call now about refund size is like making a call on election night with 5 percent of the precincts reporting. Even so, it's a rounding error difference and likely to improve. https://t.co/EMwClrOUjS
@KamalaHarris (2) The middle class got sizable tax relief in the #taxcutsandjobsact. @TaxPolicyCenter says so. @taxfoundation says so. @jctgov says so. It's not a matter up for debate. https://t.co/EMwClrOUjS

@kpomerleau it's a weird example of bad tax policy (extending the cascaded double tax on dividends to stock buybacks) being paired with good tax policy (full expensing). odd.
.@MorganStanley estimates that tax refunds will be UP by 26 percent this tax season, or $62 billion. https://t.co/2nTaFhUBKG
@KamalaHarris .@MorganStanley says that tax refunds this tax season will be up 26 percent from last tax season, or $62 billion. And the middle class got huge tax relief from the #taxcutsandjobsact. Rates cut. Standard deduction doubled. Child credit doubled and expanded. AMT near-repealed.
@ScottElliotG Except that price control plans always come paired with compulsory licensing: sell to us at the price controlled level, or we’ll steal your patent and make it ourselves. No “willing seller” in that case. It’s a mafia shakedown.
@joelieber @byHeatherLong They’re not even close on that. We’re shifted the Overton window on extenders to the following August recess.
@KimStrassel It’s pretty obvious we’re seeing story selection bias at work here. Just another in a long line of story selection bias pieces about TCJA. How many times did we read about the SALT cap last year, even though it doesn’t affect most people?
@JoshuaTMcCabe @JimPethokoukis What I can’t get past is that the stock buybacks are being purchased with after tax corporate dollars, just like dividends are issued from those dollars. We should be getting rid of cascading, not creating new ones.
@byHeatherLong @NFIB It’s interesting to cross this with that Gallup number on record personal finance optimism. Something going on specific to firms. Tariffs?
@MarcGoldwein Adopting European socialist price controls are a lousy way to cut spending.

@EWErickson This is how shutdowns end. With a whimper, getting almost nothing you wanted. Shutdowns are stupid.
@LegalMaruchana @DanCliftonStrat @RichardRubinDC They lost their exemption by getting it rolled into their bigger standard deduction, sure. They also got their rates cut. And had bigger paychecks all year. So there’s that.
@huangmiller @jbarro I’m supportive of the 529 expansion. I’m making fun of liberals calling it a tax cut for the rich since that makes no sense.
@MichaelRStrain Also bad: refunds are going to be up when this is all said and done.
This still hasn’t gotten old. https://t.co/XZg6OKdcpp
@jbarro Re: people getting mad when Obama tried to take away their 529 plans, you’re welcome. @johnkartch
@jbarro I also don’t see how rich people are going to use 529 plans to fund their dream of becoming plumbers.
@patrickmgleason Part of the new woke journalism.
By signing onto a bill to uncap the SALT deduction and raise the top marginal income tax rate to 39.6 percent, ⁦@RepChrisSmith⁩ has signaled an intention to break the pledge he made to his constituents not to raise net income taxes or tax rates.  https://t.co/GwqnaGYSLM
@byHeatherLong I think the biggest story of filing season is going to be about extensions, not refunds. We will see a record number of extensions because of the tax extenders and technical corrections (esp QIP) taxpayers will anticipate this summer and fall.
@byHeatherLong All the evidence and educated guesses tell us that the number of people with refunds will go down (GAO), that aggregate refunds will rise, and that the average refund will rise (latter two the result of the “four horsemen”—AMT, CTC, 199A, extenders). On top of bigger paychecks.

@UW90 @amconmag First, you said it was 15. Now you admit it’s 20 but want to pretend NIIT somehow doesn’t count. You’re a loser.
@JGreenDC @conncarroll Also without noting that the people with bigger refunds very likely haven’t filed yet.
@byHeatherLong She’s going to look even worse when the average refund ends up higher than last year. AMT, CTC, 199A, and extenders have yet to enter the picture. Four horsemen of the refund hot take apocalypse.
@UW90 @amconmag It’s calumny to accuse someone of being misleading just because you don’t want to admit you were wrong. Be a man.
@stanveuger @ben_ippolito 1. AMT gone/ 2. CTC doubled and applies to almost everyone/ 3. 199A will exclude one-fifth of all side income for almost everyone/ 4. Tax extenders will cut taxes retroactively
@UW90 @amconmag Sigh. The capital gains tax top rate is 20 percent. In addition, there is a 3.8 percent net investment income surtax. For high income taxpayers, the tax rate on long term capital gains is therefore 23.8 percent, or 24 percent for short. Good arguments start with good facts.
@stanveuger @ben_ippolito They’re gonna end up bigger than last year.
@UW90 @amconmag I thought conservatism was about truth and not ideology.
@UW90 @amconmag Which part? The JCT report on TCJA confirms the former. Any simple 1040 instruction confirms the latter.
@RadicalGoats @amconmag It’s right in the JCT report.
@adpackman @RichardRubinDC @Brian_Riedl Exactly my point.
RT @NKaeding: For reference, here is the static distributional table for the TCJA. Middle-income folks got tax cuts. https://t.co/sIsMHqvMt8
This is a total lie and I hope tax reporters call her on it. https://t.co/mqexg1wUZR
@huangmiller @taxgirl i think that's overblown. the personal exemptions are more than made up for by lower rates. and the dependent exemptions are more than made up for by the $2000 CTC which is available to almost anyone. SALT is made up for by de facto AMT repeal.
@patrickmgleason companies don't pay taxes--people do.
Happens once a year, a week or so after the Super Bowl. https://t.co/RPnWK8NAy2
@taxgirl Let’s see how many of these great colleagues (and I work well with them all) write “tax refunds bigger than we thought in early Feb” stories. As I said, I’m not holding my breath. It doesn’t fit the anti-Trump narrative they have pushed on TCJA stories.
@taxgirl I look forward to the follow up stories. Not holding my breath.
@taxgirl And how many stories will we see walking back these “refunds are down” narratives in April and May when more data comes in showing refund windfalls? Precious few, is my guess. Covington and Kavanaugh exposed the game here. It’s all about activist woke journalism.
@taxgirl Bias can also be seen in choice of story. Why aren’t we seeing stories about unanticipated tax windfalls for SALT capped families with kids in AMT states? Because it doesn’t fit the anti-Trump media narrative. The TCJA reporting has been unrelentingly negative from day one.
@taxgirl The pre-Super Bowl filers are W-2 singles and DINKs who rent. If anyone is likely to have gotten their tax cuts early via withholding, it is they. And I can see their refunds being slightly lower for sure. But everyone else filing is in for a pleasant surprise.
@Sean_PaddyM I doubt it. If you have dependents older than 17 it likely means those are college kids. Which likely means you own a home, have investments, etc. Those people don’t file before the Super Bowl.
@taxgirl The filers likely to get bigger than expected refunds have yet to file. Both in the aggregate and on average, refunds will be the same or bigger than last year. 15 years of tax prep instincts is yelling that in my ear. We’ll see, but I’m educated guess-level confident.
@taxgirl If i didn’t read one SALT piece after another all last year, as if that was the centerpiece of TCJA, I might be more forgiving.
@taxgirl It’s fake because the stories jump the gun. The taxpayers who will benefit from CTC, AMT repeal, 199A, and retro extenders haven’t filed yet. Just another chapter in a long line of tax reporter nitpicks of TCJA which is thinly disguised #resist anti-Trump activist journalism.
@RichardRubinDC They’re probably the next tranche. A lot of Joe and Jane Vanilla are just now pulling together their W-2s, 1099s, 1098s, and charitable deductions. Super Bowl was last week. Many of them will find themselves unexpectedly free of AMT and with a child credit they used to not have.
@NKaeding @RichardRubinDC @jimtankersley Each EIC return should have a $400 per kid bigger tax refund, all things equal.
@RichardRubinDC Isn’t the ACTC technically gone now? It’s just the 15 percent over minimum/$1400 per kid thing. But my larger point is that these EIC returns will go from ACTCs of $1000 to refundable CTCs of $1400.
@KansasCatholic Ruh-roh

RT @DanCliftonStrat: 2018 marked the 4th largest increase for S&amp;P 500 capital expenditures despite a slowing in the 2H of '18 due to China…
@dlongenecker1 “Francis as chastisement” is my favorite orthodox Catholic Twitter.
@BuckeyeinDC I doubt you’re in the 5 percent of households seeing a net tax hike.
@DanCliftonStrat @RichardRubinDC Gonna guess single people and DINKs with wage incomes and standard deductions are the ones first to file. And that’s precisely the profile of someone who got their tax cut early in withholding and might have a slightly smaller refund than before.
@adamnmichel @JM_Butcher @lindseymburke Agreed. The tax half of the argument is much stronger, albeit a bit purist for my taste. I don’t think the education half of the argument makes any sense.
@StevyB @RichardRubinDC Notably 199A
@RepublicanDore @RichardRubinDC Probably. AMT households by definition are more complex and file later. When they do, the AMT not being there anymore will be a windfall.
@BuckeyeinDC Unlikely since TCJA resulted in top one percent paying a higher percentage of all federal taxes than before. They got their rate cut from 39.6 to 37 but got their SALT capped at $10,000.
@Silver_Buck @taxfoundation @ericadyork Corporate tax cuts go to a combination of labor and capital.
@NKaeding Which is super early in the IRS case. My Spidey sense as a tax preparer tells me the “smaller refund” story is wrong.
@huangmiller @RichardRubinDC The minority is 5 percent of households, according to @TaxPolicyCenter. The beneficiaries are 80 percent of households. The other 15 percent are roughly even steven.
@RepublicanDore @RichardRubinDC AMT pretty much gone now.
@NKaeding I also don’t buy this “smaller refunds” story, despite the lower withholding. Retroactive tax extender cuts, de facto AMT repeal, lower income 199A windfalls, and child credit expansion all day the narrative is wrong.
@RichardRubinDC @lenburman I had a client this weekend who decided to do an extension and wait for the tuition and fee deduction to come back.
@RichardRubinDC I keep going back to a few things: retroactive extender tax cuts, CTC expansion, AMT repeal, and surprise 199A windfalls. Refunds will recover.

@dotdjohnson @xiancanler @TriciaCBruce @mbayer1248 Your ecclesiology is deeply American Protestant.
@wcgrimley @inflammateomnia The trick is getting a so-called “Novus Ordo Parish” to have a TLM as a gravitational force on everything, Father Z style. Without that a parish drifts to badly celebrated crappy masses.
@dotdjohnson @xiancanler @TriciaCBruce @mbayer1248 I’m very involved at my adopted parish. I serve on the Finance Council. I’m one of the largest donors. My kids are in the school and the parish American Heritage Girls. My wife is a tireless volunteer. Don’t lecture me on pitching in. I expect the liturgy to be fully Catholic.
@dotdjohnson @xiancanler @TriciaCBruce @mbayer1248 I don’t go to Mass for other people. I go to Mass to render worthy worship to Almighty God.
@dotdjohnson @xiancanler @TriciaCBruce @mbayer1248 See Canon 528: https://t.co/8vCWyk3bFT
@dotdjohnson @xiancanler @TriciaCBruce @mbayer1248 I have a right to a Catholic Mass, and to have it in full.
@dotdjohnson @xiancanler @TriciaCBruce @mbayer1248 You’re fighting canon law here.
@dotdjohnson @xiancanler @TriciaCBruce @mbayer1248 I suppose I could take on a giant mauve suburban parish all by myself. Or I could raise my family and run my business. And go to the far better parish next door. It still doesn’t relieve my territorial parish of its failure.
@dotdjohnson @xiancanler @TriciaCBruce @mbayer1248 According to the 1983 Code of Canon law, that’s exactly right. All the duties are of my territorial parish to me. I have duties toward the Church, but not my territorial parish.
@dotdjohnson @xiancanler @TriciaCBruce @mbayer1248 Because it’s my territorial parish and it’s failed me by not providing a solid liturgy. I am forced to parish shop to make sure my family gets $1.00 on the $1.00 of their Catholic birthright.
New from @GallupNews: financial optimism is at a record high https://t.co/Gtmetzzw1B
@adamnmichel @JM_Butcher @lindseymburke As I understand it, the Sch A deduction and the tax credit are for the same money going to the same entities (state scholarship programs). There’s no change except the form of the federal tax benefit (deduction vs credit).
@inflammateomnia @wcgrimley The basic problem with the ROTR is that it depends entirely on the priest. In the Novus Ordo the priest is in charge of the liturgy. In the TLM the liturgy is in charge of the priest. When that clicked for me it was all over.
@wcgrimley Some of us are ROTR people who realized after reading Peter Kwas, et al, that the Novus Ordo is not simply badly celebrated in most places and can be celebrated more traditionally (which is true). It’s also textually deficient even if celebrated perfectly.
@amoylan @ScottElliotG Resolved: it takes as much time to do your taxes with a flat tax as with a pre-1986 rate structure, all else equal. Don’t at me.
@FrAquinasOP @MarysShrine And it’s dedicated to the TLM.
@adamnmichel @JM_Butcher @lindseymburke Why haven’t federal education regulations attached to the current Sch A deduction? That’s why I’m skeptical of the education half of this argument.
@Padraig1224 @S_OReilly_USA @TaylorRMarshall They pay payroll taxes, state and local income and sales taxes, and property taxes. They also bear an incidence burden of the corporate income tax. “Skin in the game” arguments are for tone deaf Mitt Romney types.
@TaylorRMarshall This should legit be a Republican tax plan. Here it should take the form of either FICA tax relief or bigger child tax credits for rabbit families.

@JM_Butcher @adamnmichel @lindseymburke I think I disagree. The potential downsides listed here are better assigned to a direct federal tax credit voucher. This is a charitable credit. Nor am I concerned about tax complexity. This is simply moving a federal tax subsidy for these programs from Sch A to a tax credit.
@marylanestrow @SohrabAhmari @shannon_last It’s embarrassing how Never Trump twists themselves around the axle. Trump diehards never go as far in the opposite direction.
@dotdjohnson @xiancanler @TriciaCBruce @mbayer1248 Wrong. I have every right to expect beautiful and holy liturgies according to the traditions and laws of the Church. Every right. And it’s been largely withheld from me.
@dotdjohnson @xiancanler @TriciaCBruce @mbayer1248 That’s a Protestant Tweet.
@dotdjohnson @xiancanler @TriciaCBruce @mbayer1248 The standard can be found in the GIRM. For example, Gregorian Chant is to have pride of place. The Roman Canon is recommended for Sunday Mass. The Mass propers are to be sung. That sort of thing.
@dotdjohnson @xiancanler @TriciaCBruce @mbayer1248 Or, I can go to the awesome parish next door which has a Sunday TLM, a Sunday ROTR, and two weekday TLMs. And send my kids to the school there, etc.
@dotdjohnson @xiancanler @TriciaCBruce @mbayer1248 This is a very wealthy, huge parish.
@dotdjohnson @xiancanler @TriciaCBruce @mbayer1248 This isn’t about relativism or taste. Liturgy is an objective good. And the mass I described objectively sucks and is less Catholic than it should be.
@frpatrickop I’ll take “Eucharistic Mistakes Not Possible in the TLM” for $300, Alex.
@tgiovanetti Nope. That’s individualist libertarianism.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act made the federal tax system more progressive than before. The top 1 percent pay a greater share of federal taxes now than they did before TCJA. Also, the cap gains rate is 24 percent, not 15 percent. https://t.co/tYWIIEb86o

@RichardRubinDC @brendanmdunn @JohnArnoldFndtn I’m still on that argument. The tax package is a very small contributor to future deficits, even assuming permanency, compared to the entitlements. And if growth is even a little higher than CBO projects it’s way smaller. @Brian_Riedl
@dotdjohnson @xiancanler @TriciaCBruce @mbayer1248 Many many parishes are substandard. My wife went to my territorial parish last night to get her obligation in. Liturgy right out of the 1980s. Horrible music. Mixed Kyrie/EP2. Forgettable homily. Why would anyone go to that regularly?

@edzollars @cbriancpa @nittiaj But the new rules include not only the new SD and rate tables, but also things like the bigger CTC, the AMT repeal, and the 199A windfall. Why should lower refunds be the result?

@edzollars @cbriancpa @nittiaj How did withholding over-withhold?
@BrandonBirulkin @MCITLFrAphorism It’s whatever works best for the child. But ceterus paribus, an orthodox Catholic school is preferable to a priori homeschooling.
@StevyB @MarcGoldwein The riot is that it would be a tax cut for rich Democrats in blue states, and would bail out Big Gov blue state governments. We would rather use this chip elsewhere.
@huangmiller I’d rather have American citizen families with a $2000 CTC and non-residents with $0 than each with $1000.
@JimPethokoukis They should.
@huangmiller They should be, I think. But even if not, do we want tax benefits going to non-residents given scarce resources, anyway?
@MCITLFrAphorism (4) only is needed if there is not a strong Catholic school option
@btax It’s only divisive to rich blue state Dems
@MarcGoldwein Good thing Grassley won’t. And it would cause a riot among my folks.
@cbriancpa @nittiaj I also don’t believe that refunds will end up very much down. Withholding did not account well for CTC increases, AMT repeal, and 199A haircuts on side gigs.

@JaredWalczak At some point we need to get this standard deduction to the same one as federal ($24k/$12k plus inflation), and a flat tax of 5.75 percent after that. Maybe a dependent exemption to mirror the deadwood federal one. Far more rational.

@branchtruevine @ccpecknold They have religion class at a great Catholic parochial school. They go to Mass on Sunday and at least once during the week. We pray as a family. And I don't need any school marms from the chancery looking over my shoulder. My pastor can judge whether they are prepared or not.
Deep trolling. https://t.co/tFuQfh77DB
@ptbrennan11 @TriciaCBruce @xiancanler @mbayer1248 Maybe we start that fusion with a unifying pope. But let’s be honest: the immigration activists are usually heterodox, and the TLMers are grumpy asberger’s. You want to pastor them at the same time?
@ptbrennan11 @mbayer1248 @TriciaCBruce @xiancanler Just not at his parish. Which kind of makes my point about parishes.
@GoodWenceslaus @TriciaCBruce @xiancanler @mbayer1248 @RorateCaeli I moved the opposite direction. Was a ROTR diehard during the B16 years. Francis Crisis era forced me to soberly look at the Novus Ordo’s faults from a Dr Peter Kwas perspective. I’m now TLM only. Much easier that way than flexing a muscle constantly, aka keeping a ROTR good.

@De__Anima Who said that?
@mbayer1248 Really? That’s amazing. I’m not trying to be snotty. I’m just honestly surprised since you are a Catholic journalist who writes in this area.
@LillianLogos @TriciaCBruce @xiancanler @mbayer1248 They actually are mostly white libtards. If you want brown people, come to my parish. St Rita’a serves a largely illegal immigrant neighborhood.
@De__Anima The people there are almost certainly heterodox. You keep missing that. Cherry picking one thing doesn’t change their general dissent from orthodoxy. The TLM people are very likely fully orthodox.
@brandonmcg @emdeardo What if the yacht is used as a public good? If the yacht owner regularly uses it for employee appreciation parties for his employees and their families? Again, it’s not about the wealth—it’s about how moral actors use the wealth.

@De__Anima No, but I’m gonna guess almost all TLM attendees are hardcore orthodox and almost all social justice mass attendees are hardcore heterodox.

@De__Anima The immigration activists are certainly the latter.
@mbayer1248 @TriciaCBruce @xiancanler I think one of the biggest parts of this is the need for a standard deviation analysis of the Sunday prime time mass experience parish to parish.
@branchtruevine @ccpecknold What’s the worse clericalism? The clericalism of your pastor being personally involved with your sacramental foundation, or the clericalism of a faceless chancery bureaucrat rubber stamping a check box?

@TriciaCBruce @xiancanler @mbayer1248 There’s a parish in DC which is the epitome of this. They have a TLM, a Chinese Novus Ordo, and some English Novus Ordos.

@TriciaCBruce @xiancanler @mbayer1248 I also am not saying “impose the TLM everywhere or the territorial parish gets shot.” I am saying that if the Church wants territorial parishes they have to radically reduce the standard deviation of Novus Ordos celebrated. Necessary/not sufficient.
@TriciaCBruce @xiancanler @mbayer1248 No, it says a lot about the Novus Ordo. If the liturgy was basically the same everywhere I would definitely go to my territorial parish.
@xiancanler @TriciaCBruce @mbayer1248 Would make sense in a world where Catholic parishes acted like McDonald’s (same basic product everywhere). But the Novus Ordo turned all our McDonalds parishes into local diners, each a snowflake that simply has diner-ness in common.
@xiancanler @TriciaCBruce @mbayer1248 My mauve carpet aging Boomer suburban territorial parish is good for only one thing: short Confession lines on Saturday afternoon. Outside of that, I don’t know em and I don’t wanna know em. Not my kinda Catholics. Boomer Novus Ordo types.
@PiazzaThe @TriciaCBruce @xiancanler @mbayer1248 It’s a necessary descendant of the Novus Ordo. That form of the Roman Rite can be mistaken for a TLM (as my NO wedding was), or can be strung on a guitar and use a card table. Choose your own Mass, choose your own Catholicism. Clearly the answer to why this has happened.
@xiancanler @TriciaCBruce @mbayer1248 Canonically, where you lay your head.
@HannahBrockhaus Message to the Bishop of Saginaw: when the kids on their own designed and built a Catholic chapel, it turned out traditional looking.
@branchtruevine @ccpecknold I propose that chancery bureaucrats stop getting between pastors and flock. I propose that pastors take a personal role in evaluating Confirmandi and couples, and that his call is deferred to and not bureaucratized. End the sacrament in a box treatment.
@TriciaCBruce @xiancanler @mbayer1248 In this diocese there would be a civil war at most of the DC inner ring places. We’re all combative political fighters. Besides, you can’t have a TLM and an immigration rights group at the same place. Imagine the poor pastor!
@branchtruevine @ccpecknold Nope. I had all the painful lowest common denominator classroom experiences, worthless icebreaker retreats, and slave labor “service projects” I could handle. Only learned my faith post-Internet.
@branchtruevine @ccpecknold Your “sacraments in a box” diocesan bureaucratic committee model gets in the way of the pastoral relationships with their flock. It should be they, not distant chancery apparatchiks, who make these calls.
@branchtruevine @ccpecknold Glad you asked. I think forced sacramental education is bureaucratic lowest common denominator drivel that is better handled personally between pastor and faithful. Pre-Cana was horrible for me, as was Confirmation class. My pastor should have been in charge, not the diocese.
@MargoAgape Cognitive dissonance.
@TriciaCBruce @xiancanler @mbayer1248 The alternative is to sell the faithful a bill of goods: “here is your territorial parish. It’s for every Catholic in your area. Pay no attention to the obvious fact that it caters to only one genus of Catholic.”
@TriciaCBruce @xiancanler @mbayer1248 I’ve often wondered why my diocese doesn’t go whole hog here. Have a TLM/ROTR parish in every deanery. Make it a personal parish. Ditto for the social justice parish. That’s where we are in fact so we should formalize it.

@ccpecknold @branchtruevine Can you tell I’m a bit angry at growing up in the 1980s-1990s Catholic Church? As a result of its post-Conciliar liberalism and sacramental bureaucracy, I have a total distrust of the social action of the bishops. Congrats, vaticantwoists. You grew a traddie without realizing it.
@branchtruevine @ccpecknold I’d like you to justify theologically why a sacrament instituted by Christ and entrusted to the Church—a sacrament necessary for my salvation and which is an unmerited gift of God in my Baptism in Christ—is gate-kept by cluck clucking suburbanite liberal women with clipboards.

@ProfHoffer @ericadyork @NKaeding I agree with you (I think) that the $2000 CTC should apply to all dependents. It should probably phase out at a lower level of income than TCJA has it. I do think its refundabilty should be paid for with a skinnier EITC.
@ProfHoffer @ericadyork @NKaeding i can't control for outliers by definition. what's your public policy solution here?
@jdflynn That just means we won’t get to zero. I’ve never thought this was a big comfort.
@ProfHoffer @ericadyork @NKaeding It’s an odd family that has lots and lots of old DEs, none of which are CTC eligible, AND for whom the rate cuts, AMT repeal, etc results in a negative outcome. Remember that only 5 percent of households are net losers as per TPC.
@ProfHoffer @ericadyork @NKaeding That’s JCT. They assume 90 percent will use the standard deduction now. For 70 of the 90 it’s a pure addition of the PE to the old SD level. For the other 20 percentage points they migrate from itemizing but it’s pretty marginal and offset by tax cuts elsewhere.
@AlanMCole @MariaKoklanaris @jbhenchman This is close to an optimal outcome for conservatives. They will all survive, deeply unpopular, to twist in the wind.
@brpetertotleben See the death penalty heresy that conservative Catholic Twitter tries to tell me isn’t a heresy because it’s too scary for them to admit. Kinda like God willing false religions.
@ProfHoffer @ericadyork @NKaeding About the 12 and 10 brackets? A $500 credit is equivalent to a $4167 and $5000 deduction in those two brackets, respectively. Same size or bigger than old dependent exemption. Plus there’s the rest of the tax cuts.

@SteveSkojec @keith0718 @Gropher_Tump @TaylorRMarshall @Patrick_Coffin @Michael_Voris @StefMNicholas @ChristineNiles1 @BigModernism @SohrabAhmari @faithfulgadolic Should have been a separate chaplet entirely. Should have never tried to “fix” something not broken.
@SohrabAhmari They are optional for a reason. The full Rosary is 150 Ave Marias in order to mimic the 150 psalms. That’s why it’s called “Our Lady’s Psalter.” The LM just screw it up. It should have been a separate chaplet like the Divine Mercy. As is, the LM are needlessly divisive.

@AlanMCole @ernietedeschi Tax withholding changes probably captured most of the standard deduction and rate cut changes. But it likely didn’t account for the child tax credit increases, the de facto AMT repeal, or the 199A 20p haircut on side hustles. Adds up to lots of pleasant surprises.

@PalmerSchoening @BrianJohnsonMPA @MarcGoldwein Set the step up however we need to in order to make the numbers and the politics work. That’s the obvious trade, assuming JCT scores it right. Another option is to raise taxes on the rich by $20 bil per year some other way, like no SALT for them.
@BrianJohnsonMPA @MarcGoldwein And politically, carryover basis is opposed by the farm advocates of death tax repeal. So there we are. If JCT scored it properly I think we would have repealed the death tax and replaced it with EGTRRA carryover basis by now. Something like a $2 million lifetime stepup.
@BrianJohnsonMPA @RichardRubinDC @kpomerleau @JimPethokoukis The form of a consumption tax is less important than the base of one. What was politically rejected was one form, the DBCFT.
@BrianJohnsonMPA @MarcGoldwein JCT doesn’t score carryover basis as raising money, oddly. That’s why it’s not in the Thune bill.
@MarcGoldwein Actual good idea: repeal the estate tax, and replace it with EGTRRA carryover basis.
@RichardRubinDC @kpomerleau @JimPethokoukis The right policy mix is a steeply progressive consumption tax system which is very pro-growth and very pro-family.

@MarcGoldwein @Brian_Riedl @econwonk Sorry, I mean raising taxes from 17.4 to 19.
@MarcGoldwein @Brian_Riedl @econwonk That’s not what I’m saying. I’m saying we issued our compromise: raising spending from 17.4 to 19 percent of GDP durably in exchange for entitlement reform. We were nuked by the serious people for our trouble. The lesson we learned was not to negotiate with ourselves.
@MarcGoldwein @Brian_Riedl @econwonk Also a reminder that the Paul Ryan budgets had a 19 percent of GDP revenue target. They were condemned as throwing grandma in the ditch. The other side only wants higher taxes to meet unreformed spending. So why should I budge from historic taxes?
@redsteeze Not to mention generational tax reform. Also, McCain killed entitlement reform, along with “fight harder” purists like Levin.
@MarcGoldwein @Brian_Riedl @econwonk But the “serious” people always demand of the rest of us how we’re going to pay for the spending. We never seem to get to the other question, what spending cuts the “serious” people are willing to make to match our historic tax revenues. There is a clear bias.

@jimtankersley In order for CBO to be right about their next ten years’ real GDP growth rate, you have to believe the economy will grow as fast as after the Great Recession. I simply do not. Nor do I think it will average 3 percent. Something in between is the obvious choice here.

@lenburman two words why it wasn't in TCJA: Susan Collins. in the current Senate, there are probably 50 or 51 votes for full repeal. 52 or 53 if revenue neutrally replaced with alternate high income tax hikes.
@lenburman hasn't happened any other time. besides, you can keep progressivity and revenue neutrality while repealing the death tax. raise taxes on the rich elsewhere.
@lenburman @TaxPolicyCenter and despite that, two-thirds of americans want to see it repealed (and have at that level for several decades). it should be replaced with alternative taxes on the very wealthy.
@lenburman i mean, it's not in the same category as cutting the top marginal tax rate or the cap gains rate. it's a different popularity kettle of fish because people think it's gut-level unfair to tax death.

@benwoodpolprof @johnthune @ChuckGrassley @senatemajldr Here’s an extended argument I wrote on this last year: https://t.co/EKF2EVa6Mu
@dnrevel Agreed! Let’s get rid of the SALT deduction for rich people and use the money to kill the death tax. The lawyers, insurance salesmen, and estate planners will squawk the loudest.
@Brian_Riedl Oh. Well. Carry on then.
@benwoodpolprof @johnthune @ChuckGrassley @senatemajldr It’s pretty simple. Under basic economics, you would much rather deny a tax expenditure (SALT) than tax capital multiple times (death tax). There’s no reason a SALT deduction has to exist any more than a charitable or a mortgage interest deduction.
@Brian_Riedl Under the alternative fiscal scenario, the general fund transfers will be the same, but the tax cuts and discretionary spending hikes will be bigger. That’s probably the fairer metric.
@dnrevel @johnthune Why do you like doing favors for estate planners? I’m for raising taxes on the rich to get rid of this truly stupid tax.
@rachelbovard So nothing substantive that we couldn’t have had a month ago.
@DiplomaticTo @DexterJ81951092 @seanmdav Good luck getting a budget resolution through Nancy Pelosi’s House.
@benwoodpolprof @johnthune @ChuckGrassley @senatemajldr What’s so great about the death tax?
@Brian_Riedl Pushed by the same people who think nothing of carbon taxes.
@benwoodpolprof @johnthune @ChuckGrassley @senatemajldr I’d be fine with taking away their SALT.

@jbarro another thing I've found is you can combine cash back credit cards (like Fidelity 2 percent on any purchase) with app based discounts (like 5 percent off Uber cash in $100 tranches) and really bank some savings.
@NKaeding what's the cost of the generic? is that the $45 and the name brand one has a list price of $12,000? the main takeaway is that list prices are not real prices and don't send real signals.
@NKaeding it's all about the list price of the drug, the PBM and insurance company rebates negotiated with the drug manufacturer, and the post-negotiation cost of the drug. if your $45 drug is a generic, there might not be any room for them to negotiate the cost down.
@RichardRubinDC then im not sure what they're talking about
Why do I like the CBO alternative fiscal scenario better? It assumes discretionary spending grows with inflation (no sequester cuts), and a current policy tax baseline. TCJA, extenders, etc. all continue. That's the most likely political outcome. Plan accordingly.
@RichardRubinDC wow. bigger than charitable now.
@RichardRubinDC i read that as restructuring transitions to deal with GILTI and BEAT, the interest cap, etc.
@kpomerleau @Brian_Riedl it's certainly a good argument against debt and interest rates being at all positively correlated.
@kpomerleau as you point out, teeny changes in real GDP growth leverage massive changes in the economy and the fiscal picture. trillions of dollars in revenue swings.
@RichardRubinDC fair. i remember that first 2001 report and seeing these huge revenue numbers.
@kpomerleau right. i just looked up the W years, which was a recession bread sandwich administration, so hardly a cherry pick (to mix metaphors). even there real GDP growth was 2.2 percent on average. that's much more realistic to me than Obama era 1.7 or 1.8 growth. it's also not wild.
@kpomerleau the only part of this i agreed with is make full expensing permanent. i found the part about "an aging population means rising entitlement costs don't really count" unpersuasive. @Brian_Riedl bat signal.
@kpomerleau I just don't see how you have regulatory and tax policy changes that powerful and have no net real GDP increase relative to the Obama baseline.
@kpomerleau If policy changes then so would my guess (and CBO's guess is just a guess, too). But my guess is based on the massive deregulation we've seen (DHE and Mercatus have done a lot here) as well as a permanent 21 percent CIT rate and assumed 100p bonus as an extender.
@kpomerleau I should also say that I would be more confident in my gut check here if the tariff and stability issues we've seen lately were removed from the picture.
@kpomerleau Because the deregulation and pro-growth tax policies put in place mean that labor force growth and productivity growth will be somewhat higher than CBO's baseline. They are assuming Obama era stagnant growth after major policy changes. Obama average was 1.7 per year.
RT @LHSummers: The clearest indication of private sector secular stagnation. https://t.co/4T7BsH6y6B https://t.co/eakQjKzKUK
In sum, I agree with CBO on their alternative fiscal scenario and interest rate assumptions. But I disagree with them on economic growth. We're much more likely in the low-mid 2 percent range than the high 1 percent range in terms of real GDP growth. Fin.
Third, for the first time in awhile CBO is probably getting the interest rate picture directionally correct. They think that the 3 month T-bill and the 10 year T-note rates will each go up about a percentage point from current levels. Seems about right.
Second, the economic assumptions are almost certainly too pessimistic. As seen in Table 2.3, CBO is projecting sub 2 percent real GDP growth every single year of the baseline except 2019. Even if off by a few tenths of a percentage point, that's a huge swing in tax revenue.
First, you should skip all the baseline tax and spending estimates and go straight to chapter 5. There you will find the "alternative fiscal scenario" which is much more realistic in terms of both taxes and spending. Those are the real baseline numbers

@bencasselman my wild guess is that the outliers will be more in the windfall side than the liability side. i think a lot of people didn't adequately change their withholding to reflect the doubled child tax credit or 199A for side hustles.
@bopinion did they stop drinking whiskey in the front seat there in greece? yowza.
@bencasselman if you assume the new withholding tables captured most but not all of the actual tax relief (which is my assumption for most people), then we can, all things equal, expect a small increase in refunds.
Just goes to show you that negative correlations are all around us. https://t.co/W37NLj3J1Z

@jamestkeane @nimperatori @mboorstein I don’t see how I’m being dishonest here. A troll, sure. I invited myself in and picked a fight. But considering I’m arguing that murder is a worse evil than racism, I feel pretty good about my choice.

@AFarray @nimperatori @mboorstein If a human life is lost I think we’re talking about the same thing. Hierarchy matters here. Killing is the worst thing a person can do to another. It’s permanent and it destroys a life created in God’s image and likeness.
@jamestkeane @nimperatori @mboorstein I condemn racism because I’m Catholic. Also because I am Catholic I recognize murder as worse. What’s hard to see here?
@AFarray @nimperatori @mboorstein We don’t have to know any of those things. We just have to agree that murder is a worse thing to do to someone than being racist to them.
@jamestkeane @nimperatori @mboorstein Jim, don’t you agree that murder is worse than racism because it involves the taking of a human life?
@AlexParkerDC Does it help or hurt to reveal that I, too, went to an all boys Catholic HS?
@AFarray @nimperatori @mboorstein That tells me you don’t value human life very much. If someone kills a black man that’s far worse than calling him the n-word. You have to see the truth of that.
@lenburman Maybe we could do a Morning Joe bipartisan cats and dogs segment sometime. In all seriousness, there’s nearly universal support for our position in the conservative movement.

@joshuamercer @charliespiering @benshapiro @xan_desanctis Yep. People underestimate the level of orchestration needed to get that done.

@MarcGoldwein @WilliamGale2 @lenburman @BrookingsEcon @V_Williamson Revenue-neutral. A term applied to tax proposals in which provisions that raise revenues offset provisions that lose revenues so the proposal in total has no net revenue cost or increase.
@MarcGoldwein @WilliamGale2 @lenburman @BrookingsEcon @V_Williamson I use the Tax Policy Center definition of revenue neutrality.
@joshuamercer @charliespiering @benshapiro So for a few months, we barely had the votes. Which required passing a budget resolution through both chambers, and a reconciliation bill, too. Hardly the slam dunk @benshapiro and @xan_desanctis portray it as.
@MarcGoldwein @lenburman @WilliamGale2 @BrookingsEcon @V_Williamson Tell me how JCT scores that and I'll tell you if it's revenue neutral. BTW, that's a unicorn carbon tax. No one who proposes one does so without it being a large net tax hike.

@jbarro Stock market? Shutdown? Can't think of any other reasons.
@lenburman @WilliamGale2 @BrookingsEcon @V_Williamson In fact, I think you're understating it. For 99 percent of Congressional Republicans, a revenue positive carbon tax is dead on arrival. If carbon taxers want to promote a viable bill, it has to be revenue neutral. None of these come close and tend to dynamic score badly.
@lenburman Every Catholic school in the country now has and always have had that exact same policy. You are obviously free to disagree with it, but it's completely protected free exercise of religion. Within the last few years SCOTUS unanimously agreed. Pluralism is a good thing.

@AlexParkerDC The version I have heard of would automatically CR the employee payroll only.
@mlangley @dcexaminer 95 percent of private sector workers can't strike either because they have rejected labor unions.
@ShawJen1 Smoothes?
@ShawJen1 CBO is suspect?
@mlangley @dcexaminer Asking overpaid adults to be responsible is not a whine. It's a policy solution. Put on your big girl pants and save 4 percent.
@IronicIrony4 @dcexaminer @Brian_Riedl Yes. Then start saving 4 percent. Like a responsible adult would given the extra income and known risk of a shutdown.
@IronicIrony4 @dcexaminer @Brian_Riedl Save 4 percent
@mlangley @dcexaminer The only whining I see is from overpaid federal employees who think they are somehow exempt from the basic personal finance rules the rest of us have to live within.
@ShawJen1 Yeah, and one of those studies is CBO. They say you're 16 percent overpaid. That's the low end estimate of the studies but sufficient to make my point.
@IronicIrony4 @dcexaminer Sure. @Brian_Riedl has pointed out that it's been Republicans who have pushed permanent federal employee paycheck laws, only to be blocked by Democrats. Until then, can you maybe save 4 pennies on the dollar every payday?
@mlangley @dcexaminer How about preparing for the next one with your compensation advantage over the private sector. Exercise a modicum of financial responsibility instead of whining.
@ShawJen1 Only with people smart enough to take my common sense advice.
For many years I have advised college grads just starting out in politics to read "Common Sense on Investing" and to do everything it advises. Do that, and you're rich--guaranteed https://t.co/01fUAmKgF3
@USCCB Haha
If you get paid every other week and save 4 percent of your direct deposit amount, you will have a whole pay period saved in a year. Overpaid federal employees not only can do this, but basic prudence about shutdowns says they should.
In my latest ⁦@dcexaminer⁩ column, I make the case that federal government employees can and should start saving now for the next inevitable shutdown. After all, they earn least 16 percent more than their private sector counterparts.  https://t.co/pb33bYwoWo
Unless ⁦@AOC⁩ is prepared to let all sorts of income be treated as capital gains or stuffed in personal service corporations, her idea doesn't even begin to stand up to scrutiny.  https://t.co/pNZCh52UPv
@joshuamercer You should ask why some of those five aren't there. But you're right--that's academic. Absent a legislative nuclear option, this is a 60 vote deal. Mature political actors get that and go on with life. Others...do less.
You mean the federal workers paid 16 percent more than their private sector counterparts according to CBO? I thought Catholic social teaching was about the little guy, not the crony bureaucrat who lives off the little guy's taxes. https://t.co/keWyl7Ishq
@MarcGoldwein @danieljmitchell @Brian_Riedl Ok. So a revenue positive carbon tax.
@MarcGoldwein Totally agree. My points are:	1. Revenue neutral means all carbon tax dollars are plowed into tax relief./ 2. It's impossible to spend money and at the same time claim carbon tax money is being fully plowed into tax relief./ 3. Budget neutrality merely means spending the taxes.
@WilliamGale2 I'm not sure how one accurately measures the fiscal size of government by mixing tax cut apples and spending hike oranges. CBO and JCT get it right here: if you keep your own money, that's a tax cut. If you get a welfare check, that's spending. Two different things.
@parkerpoling Ugh
It's almost as if we're well short of a majority, much less 60 votes. https://t.co/9ojwHxFEW6

@WilliamGale2 @AlexBrill_DC A refundable tax credit is scored by JCT as a hybrid: to the extent it reduces income tax revenue, it's a revenue reduction. To the extent it goes beyond that, it's outlays. Other tax breaks are pure revenue reductions. The distinctions matter here.

@MichaelRStrain So you want to raise taxes and spend the money?
@MarcGoldwein @danieljmitchell @Brian_Riedl That doesn't make any sense. The transfers are spending.

@MarcGoldwein Again, you're mixing revenue neutral apples and budget neutral oranges. The only way to revenue neutrally offset a tax increase is with tax cuts. Similar issue in economist letter in WSJ.
@MarcGoldwein And "largely" payroll tax begs the question of what other tax cuts you propose here. Because you've got to plow every dollar back as tax relief for it to be revenue neutral.
@MarcGoldwein You're advocating for a revenue positive carbon tax, not a revenue neutral one. Revenue neutral means it doesn't increase or decrease either the deficit or taxes.
@MarcGoldwein it can either be revenue neutral or it can reduce the deficit. it can't do both, by definition.

@amoylan @RichardRubinDC Can that be done administratively?
@amk351 @ProfBainbridge @AOC No. The policy choice would be to tax cap gains as ordinary income for some partners and not others, based on purely non-tax ideological reasons. From a tax perspective, a cap gain is a cap gain no matter where it’s allocated. It’s the partnership’s gain.
This sounds really good to everyone outside the Beltway. https://t.co/n3u9v9fG1i

@amk351 @ProfBainbridge @AOC Do you think capital gains magically become something else when allocated to a partner you don’t approve of?
@amk351 @ProfBainbridge @AOC Because of partnership allocation. A partnership can allocate income in any way they want consistent with the PA. It isn’t like S-corps where it all needs to be proportional. This is just allocating a partnership cap gain among the partners.
@kristoncapps Didn’t say that. Said people should have expense reserves and I don’t feel bad for federal employees that chose not to.

@FERALROBOTS @AlexinWestLA Ever read it?
@drshannonscott All are true. If you save 5 percent a pay period you build up a pay period every year. Do that for six years and you have a  recommended three month expense reserve.
@colbyklaus @AlexinWestLA @FERALROBOTS I’m for most bishops going to jail, friend.
@AlexinWestLA @FERALROBOTS Unrealistic. We’re way past that now. See what the Dems did on Kavanaugh. Struggle of all against all.
@colbyklaus @TristanDawson33 Yeah your Mom says hi
@MBrodeur Those who think I’m some Trumptard.
@AlexinWestLA @FERALROBOTS I don’t expect either side to cater to the other team.
@TristanDawson33 Except if the shaming is done in bad faith. The media intentionally misstates and overstates the effects of the shutdown. And they do it because the media and the bureaucrats are just part of the Dem coalition.
@AlexinWestLA @FERALROBOTS Politics is about shirts and skins. It got this way when Obama went after the people who cling to their guns and their religion. Can’t blame us for defending ourselves.

@adamgently https://t.co/lqffC6ZcfC
@CarolForden @Omri_Marian My first job out of college paid a salary equivalent of $13.25 per hour. That was in 2000. That’s about $20 per hour in 2019. Despite that low level of pay, I saved up for and quickly had an expense reserve.
@WellsIAm @Arash_Mohebbi @LouisatheLast That would be Pope Francis-McCarrick-Wuerl-Cupich liberal vaticantwoist Catholicism.
@sailorstout @jankybrain Im for sure fat but less all the time.
@colbyklaus @elcrean @J_B_Breck @Spokesfox No kids are starving.
@LouisatheLast @eleighdo @Arash_Mohebbi Says the insane lesbian neighbor. I’m sure you respect their religious liberty rights.
@Omri_Marian @CarolForden *deferred* pay
@StallmansBeard Been going to Patriots training camp every year since 1994, bro. Bryant College days. Make an annual pilgrimage to the Patriots Hall of Fame. Most of my casual clothes are Patriots clothes. I once conspired with Barstool to corner Roger Goodell on Capitol Hill during Deflategate
@colbyklaus @elcrean @J_B_Breck @Spokesfox I don’t care about the wall and think the shutdown is a mistake.
@CarolForden @Omri_Marian They chose when they stayed.
@sailorstout @Eliza_Chartres Only when my wife is too tired from cleaning my giant house.
@WellsIAm First, that’s called being financially responsible and funding an expense reserve. Second, and related, that’s now one of my four rental properties. I now live in a house with twice the square footage of that one.
@WellsIAm No apologies. Go Pats. Defend the wall.
@CarolForden @Omri_Marian They knew what this was when they signed up.
@drshannonscott I live in a world of financial responsibility and scant pity for those who drink their potential expense reserves away at avocado toast Sunday funday brunches.
@iboudreau @mjskansas Fair point
@CarolForden @Omri_Marian Hymen Roth. Tony Soprano. Facts of Life theme.

@eleighdo @Arash_Mohebbi @LouisatheLast I didn’t go to your vaticantwoist propaganda classes.
@FishEcon Maybe don’t wear the Dem jerseys so much and I won’t think that.
@drshannonscott They’d be just now starting to work down their reserve since the first deferred pay was yesterday.
@Omri_Marian @CarolForden TSA is unionized security theater.
@CarolForden @Omri_Marian TSA should not exist. And we are a little more than 24 hours into deferred pay.
@Omri_Marian @CarolForden Half the states won’t unionize them.
@jkfecke Yes. And part of that agreement is that in the event of a shutdown your paycheck is delayed. Hymen Roth/Tony Soprano/Facts of Life theme.
@CarolForden @Omri_Marian The TSA is a government union boondoggle. Let the states do it like they used to.
@jason_pontin Yep.
@jankybrain Just in my family.
@mjskansas The last 18 hours of my feed confirms that the deep state is real and it’s on Twitter.
@Omri_Marian And anyone else
@jkfecke You don’t have a right to your taxpayer financed job.
@jankybrain First missed paycheck was yesterday.
@pamsky65 @lastbesthope2 Only in a Keynesian construct.
@mjskansas Oh those poor federal employees who can’t be fired and earn more than the private sector. My heart bleeds for their deep state bank accounts.
@Omri_Marian If it’s one or two pay periods they should hardly notice. If they do notice their expense account wasn’t big enough. Should be enough for three months of bills.
@jankybrain An excellent argument for an emergency reserve and a sentiment tempered by your higher pay and permanent employment.
@jankybrain No, it makes them irresponsible. An expense reserve is a multiple of a month’s income built up by saving a percentage of a month’s income. It matters not at all what the dollar figures are there. If there is not enough cash flow they should spend less or earn more. I did.
@Bhold3531 Get an expense reserve, hippie. You’ve heard that several hundred times before in your life. Not my problem you ignored Noah about the rain storm.
@mrcz032308 Too late. Blessed be the fruit, mofos.
@elcrean @J_B_Breck @Spokesfox Hymen Roth. Tony Soprano. Facts of Life theme.
@jkfecke Then they should learn from that and start building an expense reserve for the inevitable next government shutdown we all know will happen someday. One just happened a year ago.
@Omri_Marian The longest one ever is a month or so. Statistically irrelevant in a 2.5 percent annual inflation environment.
@jankybrain If I was getting paid in a week or two? Probably. I wouldn’t notice the cash flow delay because I’m responsible and have an expense reserve.
@LittleGreenHero @mattyglesias Never hurts
@Arash_Mohebbi @LouisatheLast I’m a traditional Catholic not a libertarian. We’re against the deep state, too.
@mlmatyac Well I’m not a reporter so there’s that.
@Omri_Marian Two weeks late is what time value in a 2.5 percent inflation economy?
@jkfecke By a week or two?
@mjskansas You missed my point
@drshannonscott That’s why you keep replenishing it. No excuses. No matter what you make you should always put 5 percent in the bank for a rainy day. True if you make $1000 or $10,000 a pay period.
@mlmatyac Thanks but I’m a confirmed coward. Also, threatening violence on Twitter is a no-no.
@bennybragan Hymen Roth. Tony Soprano. Facts of Life theme.
@drshannonscott Expense reserve. It’s a wonderful thing.
@mjskansas I of course meant Hymen Roth. Damnit.
@mjskansas Moe Green/Tony Soprano answer for them, too. They are happy to take the upside effects of lobbyists with expense accounts and the “other people’s money” syndrome. You take the good you take the bad you take it all and there you have the facts of life.
@J_B_Breck @Spokesfox Federal employees are more highly compensated than their private sector counterparts, all things equal.
@mlmatyac So he hasn’t voted Republican in four election cycles, and that disproves my point how?
@BudgetBen @dylanmatt @EconCharlie Yep. There’s a reason everyone who starts a shutdown by demanding something eventually loses. Schumer learned that a year ago with the DREAM Act, and I thought we had been burned enough times ourselves. This shutdown is unlikely to work. Still don’t feel bad for the deep state.
@Spokesfox Do they have insurance policies? If yes, I don’t feel bad because that’s what insurance is for. If no, I don’t feel bad because not carrying insurance in a hurricane zone is a dumb moral hazard.
@mjskansas After the first two years it’s virtually impossible absent a smoking gun. Don’t forget that I’m not Tweeting from a cabin in the mountains. I’ve been a swamp creature since 1996 and know lots of federal workers. I married one.
@TClarityLane Many more than follow you.
@Spokesfox Pick your TV or movie reference: Moe Green in Godfather 2 (“this is the business we have chosen”) or Tony Soprano (“you knew what this was”). Part and parcel of what they signed up for. They take the ups and they should take the downs just like everyone else.
@beardyblue At least now you have the long version to read. And no, I’m not giving an inch.
But my larger point remains. The media trying to shame Republicans/conservatives/Trumpists won’t work any better than when they try to on media access rights. The jig is up. We know that the media and the deep state are the other team and we don’t really care (fin)
It’s important to distinguish between my opinion about federal bureaucrats and shutdowns on the one hand, and the particulars of this shutdown on the other. As sane Twitter knows, I think this shutdown is ill-considered and Trump is unlikely to prevail. (6)
James Sherk when he was at Heritage pioneered the research proving that federal bureaucrats were more highly paid than their private sector counterparts (all things equal), AND that they can’t be fired. They get TSP and FEHB, the best benefits out there. Again, I’m not upset (5)
For any federal worker for the past 25 years, the occasional shutdown has been an occupational hazard. As Tony Soprano once said, they knew what this was. They should neither be shocked nor financially unprepared. If they are that’s their moral hazard, not mine. (4)
I also firmly maintain that most of these people are precinct workers for the Democrat party, and that in many/most cases these jobs are deemed non-essential and probably shouldn’t be supported by my tax dollars. So it’s hard for me to see their pay deferral as some crisis (3)
First, what is it I don’t feel bad about? This is important. I don’t feel bad that the government is essentially putting these employees’ paychecks in a drawer and giving them to them when the shutdown ends. It’s not a loss of pay—it’s a deferral of pay. That gets lost a lot. (2)
So insane #resist Twitter has been helping me with my follower count and impressions footprint over the past 18 hours (sincere thanks to @mattyglesias). For the sake of sane Twitter I thought I would revise and extend my remarks about govt employees and the shutdown (1)
@LouisatheLast Only if they send me a thank you note for my tax dollars first
@wakeupangry Its called traditional Catholicism. You practice vaticantwoism.
@wakeupangry Probably because you go to some heretical Catholite parish. Read “Faithful Citizenship.”
@Masterm57227816 @ganglywhitegirl So am I MAGA or a swamp creature fat lobbyist?
@wakeupangry You said I needed to follow whatever the USCCB or Pope Francis said, which isn’t Church teaching. Then when I point out a binding teaching on Catholics, you’re out. So get your shit together on this.
@williamdalemc God bless you too
@WalterFBiela @2020fight @AustinJSpillane @ChuckyWallace No, it was the entire economy collapsing followed by terrorists flying planes into buildings followed by two quagmires we’re still stuck in. 2008-2010 was really bad, but there were other major downturns before it.
@FieldingFishly @AustinJSpillane @_karl_bark @ChuckyWallace Agreed
@2020fight @josephripken @AustinJSpillane @ChuckyWallace Now tell me median.
@2020fight @josephripken @AustinJSpillane @ChuckyWallace For everyone. I’ve been doing this quite some time. What was the median income for a family of four in 1986?
@josephripken @2020fight @AustinJSpillane @ChuckyWallace She didn’t work back then. And the comp is families of four, not average income for all household types.
@wakeupangry There’s a hierarchy of these things. You can’t try to dunk on me for secondary shit people can have honest disagreements on. Especially if you’re not there in all the intrinsic stuff.
@wakeupangry How about marriage and religious liberty? Those are also pretty strongly held positions by the USCCB and Francis. And a lot more important than immigration.
@WalterFBiela @2020fight @AustinJSpillane @ChuckyWallace My family was median income for a family of four. I graduated at the top of the dot com bubble and 9/11, and bought just in time for the housing crash. And I’m an Xennial, broseph.
@2020fight @josephripken @AustinJSpillane @ChuckyWallace Median income for a family of four means half earn more and half earn less. Guess what that’s called? Middle class!
@wakeupangry I follow Church teaching.
@MeMySylvanEye @OregonJOBS2 Yep. Trump self defense vote looking good.
@wakeupangry The USCCB has your full support on abortion, then? You seem like you demand support across the board, so surely you are pro-life, which is the most important issue.
@wakeupangry He’s the pope. He’s a bad pope.
@pghfur @OregonJOBS2 Thanks for confirming my vote for Trump.
@Patchemup1 @sntientmustache You mean normal?
@wakeupangry No one gets to impose their personal views on immigration as binding on other Catholics. It’s not like abortion or racism, which are intrinsic evils. This is a case where good Catholics are free to disagree.
@2020fight @josephripken @AustinJSpillane @ChuckyWallace So pretty close to median income for a family of four.
@phillips_stacey Thank you.
@wakeupangry None of that is binding.
@josephripken @2020fight @AustinJSpillane @ChuckyWallace I was super working middle class growing up. I’m the first affluent person ever in my family.
@wakeupangry Again, not binding on Catholics. Also, Bergoglio is an idiot and a heretic.
@OregonJOBS2 I’m afraid the Left will force my Catholic parish and school to shut down.
@wbbowmer @AustinJSpillane @_karl_bark @ChuckyWallace @mattyglesias Agreed. I’m pulling for it to be their Mom.
@EJRaoulduke1976 @_karl_bark @ChuckyWallace @AustinJSpillane At least.
@_karl_bark @AustinJSpillane @EJRaoulduke1976 @ChuckyWallace If I had to say one it would probably be making sure business fixed investment is immediately expensed rather than depreciated.
@wakeupangry That’s not binding on Catholics.

@AustinJSpillane @_karl_bark @ChuckyWallace Again, a fair point.
@beardyblue That’s me. I’m an American who makes fun of terms like that. So do most people.
@MaryHartmanx2 @2020fight @AustinJSpillane @ChuckyWallace You are correct. And unlike a Millenial I’m not whining or asking for a bailout.
@AustinJSpillane @_karl_bark @ChuckyWallace Surely we can shed at least some of them permanently. I’ve seen these people on the Metro. Low energy.
@2020fight @AustinJSpillane @ChuckyWallace How are Millenials doing in this fantastic Trump economy?
@wakeupangry None of which are core Catholic doctrinal or moral teachings.
@AustinJSpillane @2020fight @ChuckyWallace It works for me. Twice it has, in fact. Might not for others. But it works like a charm for me.
@2020fight @AustinJSpillane @ChuckyWallace You mean like the Trump Economy?
@_karl_bark @ChuckyWallace @AustinJSpillane I’d like to know why we have all these apparently non-essential employees on the payroll.

@_karl_bark @ChuckyWallace @AustinJSpillane It’s irregular but anticipated.
@DeborahReaves2 @AustinJSpillane @_karl_bark @ChuckyWallace Who the hell would vote for Mr Sunshine over here?
@2020fight @AustinJSpillane @ChuckyWallace That’s bullshit. Like I said, I graduated into the dot com bubble and 9/11.
@2020fight @AustinJSpillane @ChuckyWallace No, I worked my ass off. My Dad worked in a factory as a union rep and my Mom is a school secretary. I built this from scratch and I resent whiny Millenials who don’t want to scratch and claw.
@DeborahReaves2 @AustinJSpillane @_karl_bark @ChuckyWallace Untrue! I’d happily lobby myself out of business for that. We’d all be richer as the economy grew faster.
@2020fight @AustinJSpillane @ChuckyWallace I started with nothing. No contacts. Student loan debt. Just my talent and drive to win.

@AustinJSpillane @2020fight @ChuckyWallace Fair.

@_karl_bark @ChuckyWallace @AustinJSpillane I’m not sure how I can be more clear. Government employees know shutdowns are an irregular way of life. They know they need to budget for savings. If they don’t I really can’t say I’m moved to tears.

@ChuckyWallace Were you this concerned when Schumer shut down the government last spring?
@ChuckyWallace They knew this was a risk when they signed on and should have had savings for the inevitable shutdown.

@_celia_bedelia_ @NKaeding @carmstrong07 @washingtonpost @politico It’s called an expense reserve. Again, they knew this happened from time to time when they signed on
@hwestonbull_hhh @carmstrong07 @NKaeding @washingtonpost @politico We’re not playing any games with paychecks. All these people get paid 100 percent of their salary when the shutdown ends.
@pbfa @Verajlopez If it helps I’m clean shaven now and I’ve been on the Atkins since Memorial Day!
@ChuckyWallace It’s a honest accounting for why Trump won. Lots of very scared Catholics and evangelicals.
@NKaeding @carmstrong07 @washingtonpost @politico They all eventually get paid 100 percent of their salary. That’s important context.
@NKaeding @carmstrong07 @washingtonpost @politico Let’s not forget all these people get 100 percent of their pay when the shutdown ends. What’s the great humanitarian crisis here?
@NKaeding @carmstrong07 @washingtonpost @politico So the occasional shut down isn’t part of the compensation package? I always assumed that was part of the deal.
@Josephdoke23 Knights of Columbus-gate explains it.
@joshuamercer @TPCarney @Weigel @daveweigel Yep LOL. Sorry @weigel
@JaredWalczak @AlexParkerDC @ebruenig It’s both. These people don’t have a right to their jobs. And they knew about the risk of shutdowns when they signed up. And yes, it’s only been 18 hours. And no, i don’t feel bad for them because they work to defeat our team. No one is starving here—back pay.
@TPCarney Bat signal @weigel
@carmstrong07 @NKaeding @washingtonpost @politico Wasn’t the occasional shutdown part of the deal when these folks were hired? How is it some massive human tragedy now when it’s happened?
@carmstrong07 @NKaeding @washingtonpost @politico How about in a full employment economy people who get paid from our tax dollars should be encouraged to work in the productive sector instead?
@twitskeptic @JaredWalczak @ebruenig TSA shouldn’t exist.
@AlexParkerDC @JaredWalczak @ebruenig These are next of kin to DNC employees who leech off our tax dollars. Why would their being out of work bother me? We have full employment. They can get jobs I don’t have to pay for.
@NKaeding @washingtonpost @politico What part? That Republicans think of government employees as part of the other team? I think that’s pretty non-controversial.
@NKaeding @washingtonpost @politico Why all this love for federal employees from the Tax Foundation?
@AlexParkerDC @JaredWalczak @ebruenig 18 hours. That’s how long they have gone without pay.
@JaredWalczak @ebruenig Human dignity is not on the table here. Step away from the ledge. The Friday pay was due 18 hours ago.
@JaredWalczak @ebruenig FWIW I’m opposed to the shutdown. But the people so concerned about the people not getting paid are showing their true colors by not wanting to fund the Wall.
@JaredWalczak @ebruenig These are six figure compensation people who will get back pay when this is over. And they work with our tax dollars. They have jobs for life.
@JaredWalczak @ebruenig If it’s that bad then gee I guess it’s worth $5 billion for Trump’s wall. Or do you care more about the wall than the people?
@ebruenig I’m not a libertarian. Neither am I a Marxist. I’m a Centesimus Annus Catholic.
@ebruenig My money doesn’t belong to me? CST would tend to disagree with you. If my money is taken to create a non-essential job, I get to be ok with that job going away.
@NKaeding @washingtonpost @politico They’re all precinct workers for the Democrats. I don’t feel bad for them. They get paid way more than their private sector equivalents. They get paid with our tax dollars. Most of their jobs shouldn’t exist.
@ebruenig CST doesn’t apply when it’s taxpayer funded jobs. Not unless you want to talk about the right I have to my property under CST.
@NKaeding @washingtonpost @politico Do you think that the 17 hours these six figure compensation, taxpayer financed, overwhelmingly Democrat voting folks have gone without pay is some sort of humanitarian crisis?

@esquires1215 @washingtonpost @politico No one has a right to a tax funded job.
@kwyrauch Honest question: what is a “ratio” in this context!
@EconCharlie What’s off-putting to me is my tax dollars being used to pay Democrat precinct workers between elections.  That’s how we view government employment.
@ryan_mcrae TSA should not exist. And I’m not a fan of most of the rest there.
@EconCharlie This isn’t a charity. These people can’t be fired and make way more than the private sector does. This is a high class problem for them and I don’t feel the least bad for them.
@shepherdahlers @washingtonpost @politico I’d be for that. It would mean we have a simple system with low taxes.
@EconCharlie No argument there. I’m just saying I don’t mourn the job.
@TechnoSocialist Correct.
@ARPdid911 “Working people” LOL. Lifetime guaranteed job six figure government employees.
@EconCharlie Ok. So let’s say half are actually non-essential. That’s still 400,000.
@Cuw @washingtonpost @politico I’d be ok with that.
@hilaryagro I’m self made. And it’s called a savings account. Perhaps these bureaucrats with their unfire-able jobs might consider adding to it for the next rainy day.

@dylanmatt @BudgetBen @EconCharlie You people were so nice to me yesterday when I said Trump shouldn’t invoke emergency powers to build the wall. See the connection? I’m against Big Government.
@BeltransMole23 That would be a start.
@jiwallner @brendanmdunn Then you can choose between Leadership and Pelosi. Choosing Pelosi resulted in sub-optimal outcomes.
@nick_tacik @washingtonpost @politico Not a charity.
@libbycwatson Oh, the poor government employees. The humanity. Cry me a River.
@jiwallner @brendanmdunn It’s also what happened literally a dozen times between 2011 and 2018. Voting with the Democrats makes no sense because it forces Leadership to bribe Democrats to get on the bill.
Oh, please. This is hardly a humanitarian crisis. This is a pay period lapse which is literally hours old. And frankly, I don’t think these jobs should exist so I’m not concerned.
@BudgetBen @EconCharlie But they turned. That’s the point. I’d venture a guess that federal employees are about 90/10 Democrats. And Republicans don’t think their jobs should exist—they’re non-essential. So why should we care? They don’t have a right to my tax dollars.
@CardsFanTX @tgiovanetti @RAVerBruggen @NRO Correct, it’s zero. But the substantive point still stands. People can buy non-Obamacare individual insurance again. And that’s a big deal.
@jiwallner @brendanmdunn 218 is coming from somewhere. If it comes from 218 Republicans the government spends less money than if it comes from 150 Republicans and 100 Democrats. Each of those Democrat votes comes with a price tag.
Tax hiker likely to get primaried. https://t.co/ZB30aeayt3
I don’t think the @washingtonpost and @politico have figured out yet that almost no federal employees vote Republican, that Republicans know this, and that we’re therefore not swayed by hardship stories during shutdowns. It’s isn’t that hard.
@CardsFanTX @tgiovanetti The individual mandate repeal made a whole heck of a lot of Obamacare escape hatches possible. See what @RAVerBruggen wrote about this in @NRO

@jiwallner @brendanmdunn By refusing to vote for any budgets, the FC forced the GOP to go to Pelosi for votes, making spending bills worse. Simple as that. If the GOP hung together and shut out the Dems, spending would be lower today.

@matthewrich2019 @GeoffDB @jdflynn It’s a bunch of people speaking in tongues babbling in a parish hall. And their liturgies suck. What am I missing?
@dlongenecker1 And only one nitpick: the TLM is far older than 500 years. That’s just when that edition of the Missal was promulgated. Goes back to Pope St Gregory the Great and then the apostles.
@brpetertotleben The Catechism should not be a Wikipedia page. And “the death penalty is inadmissible” is a heresy because it must be permitted at least in theory.
@TaylorRMarshall We have one at our parish. It is a unicorn.
@dlongenecker1 The only general comment I will make here is that the difference between the ROTRNO and the TLM comes down to two words: “I like.” A totally different mentality. The TLM doesn’t care what you like. It is. You receive.
@dlongenecker1 BTW, you don’t need to know Latin before learning the TLM. The Latin is pretty simple and the repetitive, and the mass will teach it to you. Same as us laity and our hand missals.

@NKaeding Oh I have. It’s an issue.
@RichardRubinDC I would have rather used that money on tax relief which is more pro-growth. Bracket creep plus full expensing is better than indexed brackets and MACRS plus bonus.
@Brian_Riedl As more and more middle class taxpayers entered unreasonable tax brackets, there would be tax revolts every 10-20 years, guaranteed. We haven’t really had one since the 1970s.

@SteveSkojec The best part of this is that it finally clicked for me that even if a priest chooses every single ROTR option for a Novus Ordo, it’s still starting from a place of the priest being in charge of the mass. The TLM is in charge of the priest. Totally different liturgical minds.
@jdflynn And quasi-heresy
@PDeVous His logic about the party is off but he isn’t about King.
@JonahNRO Incidentally, as always, a full read of Centesimus Annus helps here. And not just the American neo-Cath readings.
@JonahNRO Man has a natural right to engage in commerce but this is, as you say, restrained. We would say he is restrained by the moral law to serve God and his fellow man before himself. Law should help and encourage this “fellow feeling” (to steal from Adam Smith) 2/2

@lenburman DBCFT
@Alexistrends99 @dlongenecker1 Even if a priest chooses traditional options for a Novus Ordo, that still means the priest is in charge of the liturgy. In the TLM, the liturgy is always in charge of the priest. Totally different mentality regardless of Novus Ordo outcome. It matters.

And before you mention FICA, I will see your redundant payroll tax and raise you a cascaded double tax on corporate income.
In fact a family has to make $200,000 a year or higher (half that for singles) before they have a higher wage income tax rate than the capital gains rate. And that’s thanks to the supposedly pro-rich TCJA.
Capital gains are taxed at a higher rate than wage income for middle class workers, even if you ignore the “two bites at the apple” problem with the corporate tax. 12 percent middle class. 24 percent cap gains. It’s half. Now who has the tired narrative? https://t.co/TZxo0MmXBv

@jzipple @palpasb For my part, the abuse crisis is the only thing that matters right now. We don’t have a functional Catholic Church until it’s eradicated. And it’s 80/20 a gay clergy thing to deal with. Sexually incontinent SSA clergy and the networks that cover for them.

If this was part of state specific baton handoffs between an 1115 legacy and partial expansion Medicaid, and a 1332 State snowflake Obamacare, it would be a lot more interesting. As is, it’s a firewall to full expansion or a gateway drug to expand, depending on assumptions.
@chrisjacobsHC @FDRLST @philipaklein @USCBO @CMSGov Does this have to do with 1115 and 1332 waiver integration or is this outside that conversation?
@chrisjacobsHC @FDRLST @philipaklein @USCBO @CMSGov I guess I’m just pessimistic and assume that all states will full expand sooner or later at the rate we’re going.
@chrisjacobsHC @FDRLST @philipaklein if a state doesn't get a waiver to partially expand medicaid at the 90p match rate, won't the other shoe to drop simply be to do the full expansion? it seems unlikely to me the other shoe to drop is no expansion at all, which seems to be your baseline here.

@kyrie_eleison3 @dlongenecker1 Good. But remember the ROTRNO is not an end in itself. It’s a bridge to the true mass.
@kyrie_eleison3 @dlongenecker1 The Novus Ordo was not designed to be traditional. They would have just kept the traditional mass if tradition was desired. The ROTR we came up with decades later in a desperate attempt to write straight with crooked lines.
@fensandspineys @dlongenecker1 In fairness, that’s also not a typical modern Novus Ordo. It’s still worse than a sloppy 1950s low mass, but it’s not that bad.
@kyrie_eleison3 @dlongenecker1 Then you ought to try to make your Novus Ordo as traditional as possible. Make the best with what you’ve got. I’m all for that.
@kyrie_eleison3 @dlongenecker1 I’m not talking about abominations. I’m talking about Baby Boomer Lady EMHCs, teenage altar girls, the mixed Kyrie, the fake but valid Eucharistic prayers, etc. Features, not bugs, of the Novus Ordo.
@frathermatt I haven’t been to a non-Roman Canon mass in either major form in a very long time. You can’t beat 4th century anaphoras. Especially if the competition is written at a Trastevere wine bar in 1968.

@kyrie_eleison3 @dlongenecker1 But regardless of that question, why not just go for the real Roman Rite mass? The one that obviously is not a problem?
@kyrie_eleison3 @dlongenecker1 Are you sure the ROTR is “the proper application of the missal?” Maybe the Novus Ordo was intentionally designed to be bad from our perspective and was never meant to be celebrated in continuity with the authentic Roman Rite.
@BrianWandell @brendanmdunn @DouthatNYT @TuckerCarlson Because Twitter fights are fun even as they eat your soul, that’s why.
@kyrie_eleison3 @dlongenecker1 So does mine. I attend it as my backup Mass to our TLM. It used to be my primary Mass. We are lucky. 99 percent of parishes don’t have anything close to a ROTR Novus Ordo. And that’s a big part of this conversation. The Novus Ordo almost always and everywhere sucks.

@joshuamercer @dlongenecker1 Good. We should all go to the highest and best use of the Roman Rite we can reasonably attend. Objectively that’s the TLM. But you do what you can with what you have and work to improve local conditions.
@joshuamercer @dlongenecker1 No, he isn’t. But that doesn’t mean his head is in the right place, either. The ROTR is not a good end unto itself. It is a good insofar as it prepares someone to accept the true Roman liturgy, the TLM. It’s a halfway house for Novus Ordo refugees journeying to their real home.
@joshuamercer @dlongenecker1 The Novus Ordo is the Modernist liturgy of the Bergoglio Church. They are pretenders sitting on the throne. We have to depose them and all the wicked innovations their brood has come up with over the past 50 years. Burn the whole thing down. All of it.
@joshuamercer @dlongenecker1 I still remember discovering my grandmother’s St Joseph Missal from 1958 when I was about ten. I used to read it over and over. Later on, I got mad that this super cool form of Catholicism was stolen from me. My birthright. Now we have it back and we have to reclaim our lands.
@joshuamercer @dlongenecker1 Correct. But on it’s own it was probably the main thing causing people to drop out. Why go to a Gift of Finest Wheat felt banner Mass with an effeminate priest? What man would go to that? But that was the Church of my youth.
@dlongenecker1 @joshuamercer Modernism is definitely the macro-Heresy. It’s what created the Novus Ordo, as well, so maybe we’re not that far apart. Remember that EP2 was written by gay priests at a wine bar in Trastevere. That’s Modernism in liturgical form.
@dlongenecker1 If I’m close to correct that for 99 percent of Catholics all of their adult Catholic experiences happen at Mass, there’s nothing else inside the Church that explains their apostasy except the Novus Ordo. It’s not as if they left because they rejected the Liturgy of the Hours.
@joshuamercer @dlongenecker1 My larger point, of course, is that the Novus Ordo being as screwed up as it is—not only as it’s nearly-universally celebrated, but also textually—in fact does explain the mass Catholic apostasy of the past 50 years. There is nothing else for 99/100 Catholics to explain it!
@joshuamercer @dlongenecker1 Of all Catholics? Keep in mind 80 percent don’t even go to Mass every week, so I’m pretty confident it’s 80/80 for them. Of the remaining 20 percent, I’m saying 19 have no real prayer life. Top five percent of mass goers do.
@RichardRubinDC @ScottElliotG It would have to be much tougher. Like 0 percent instead of 28 percent.
@RichardRubinDC @ScottElliotG I’ll do you one better: I’ll design it myself. Deny the 1 percent Sch A. Make them pay tax on muni bond interest, life insurance, and health insurance. See where that takes their average effective rate and we keep going. But by all means, #tippetytop
@FrAndrewHart Second suggestion: find some weasel word “pastoral considerations” language in the rubrics and remember that you minister to yourself.
@HankHolcomb3 @dlongenecker1 My suggestion in your case is to work to make your Novus Ordo as ROTR as possible. But don’t forget that the ROTR is just a bridge to the best and truest form of the Roman Rite. The Novus Ordo is genetically deformed.
@BrianWandell @brendanmdunn @DouthatNYT @TuckerCarlson People who give the rich unlimited SALT deductions are fake progressives who have shown that they are just virtue signaling.
@RichardRubinDC @ScottElliotG Thought experiment for the Left: design a tax system where the top one percent pays an average effective income tax rate of 30 percent (higher than today) but with a marginal income tax rate of 35 percent (lower than today). Now that would be serious. 70 percent is dumb.
@FrAndrewHart Is there a local St Raymond parish nearby?

@dlongenecker1 Would you agree that for 99 percent of Catholics, their Sunday Mass experience is 100 percent of their Catholic activity?
@dlongenecker1 My evidence that people don’t like it? 80 percent of Catholics choose not to go to it. If it was popular it would be attracting these people. It clearly isn’t attractive to them because it’s too horizontal and ugly. By design.
@dlongenecker1 I wasn’t comparing it to porn but I did leave you that opening rhetorically. The Novus Ordo as you see it 99.9 percent of the time is valid but bad for your faith formation. It’s clearly the number one reason the second biggest denomination is ex-Catholic. People don’t like it.
@adum23 @uncriticalsimon @Brian_Riedl You lose ALL the weekend job income to taxes with a 100 percent marginal tax rate on that income.

@adum23 @uncriticalsimon @Brian_Riedl Try to follow along. If there is a 100 percent marginal tax rate on all income over $10,000,000, then the tax rate on the $10,000,001st dollar earned is 100 percent. You lose that entire dollar. Do you work to earn it or do you stop at $10,000,000?

@ScottElliotG I’ve got a wild idea. How about we have a tax system where marginal tax rates on the rich aren’t that much higher than average effective tax rates on the rich?
@JohnGalt23 @dlongenecker1 In the B16 era, I was Mr ROTR. Would go to quarterly or so TLMs which I enjoyed. Slowly, slowly the logic of the ROTR as an end to itself started to fall apart. People like Peter Kwas and Greg DiPippo helped A LOT.
@JohnGalt23 @dlongenecker1 Think about it this way: all the things you like about a ROTR NO that is unique to that variety of the NO are nothing more than TLM imports. Name me one thing that isn’t. English chant maybe? There isn’t much. So what do you ACTUALLY like at it? The TLM is the answer.
@JohnGalt23 @dlongenecker1 It is a good and true and right thing to try to make a Meh Novus Ordo a ROTR Novus Ordo. But it’s a bridge to the TLM. No substitute for the real thing. The rest are just Plato’s wall shadows.
@JohnGalt23 @dlongenecker1 It can be done, if absolutely everything is perfectly aligned. Right priest. Right building. Right music staff. Right parish. Right bishop. Remove one or two of those and it all falls apart like a soap bubble. Then what does it default to? The true form of the Novus Ordo.
91 percent marginal federal income tax rate. 17 percent average effective federal income tax rate. There’s a lesson in there somewhere. https://t.co/W4itOJJhoX
@NKaeding If by “running,” you mean watching playoff football, estoy de acuerdo
@JohnGalt23 @dlongenecker1 Promoting the ROTR as if it’s the future of the NO is snake oil. It never will be because it’s too hard to do and ultimately entirely dependent on the priest. Everything has to be aligned just right. I used to be a big ROTR guy then I stopped fighting logic.
@JohnGalt23 @dlongenecker1 The ROTR is very very rare. It is useful as a bridge to the highest and best form of the Roman Rite, the TLM. It is no more natural to the OF than the clown mass is. The settled and typical NO is the ugly suburbs altar girl EP2 bad music EMHC variety and we all know it.
@dlongenecker1 This is going to sound horrible, but I don’t really give a damn what people like. I care about what is good and true and beautiful. People like porn too.
@dlongenecker1 It’s a hell of a coincidence. And the typical modern Novus Ordo is far worse for Catholics than the sloppy mumbled 1950s low mass.

@JMooch82 @FitzyGFY You cheated again!
@dlongenecker1 Acting locally i completely agree with. I’ve tried to be as supportive of my pastor as possible in both our ROTR and TLM Sunday options. A rising tide lifts all boats. But the ROTR is a bridge, not a destination. The goal is the TLM.
@dlongenecker1 The liturgy they are given should help our poor and sorry lot. The NO creates former Catholics. That’s why it matters. It’s not as if the NO is an alternate good. It’s bad. It’s presided over the collapse of the Church and is its midwife.
@JMooch82 @FitzyGFY Dunno but if we were the 1 seed we’d get the red hot Colts and KC would get SD for a third time. I’d rather be us. Decent shot of AFCCG in Foxboro now.
@dlongenecker1 To me the really interesting comparison is Sunday typical vs Sunday typical and evaluate on that basis. IMHO, that means a Missa Cantata vs the Our Lady of the Suburbs special.
@dlongenecker1 Fair point there.
@FitzyGFY 10:05 AM body clock for LAC, second week in a row. Have to travel LA to DEN to LA to BAL to LA to BOS.
@dlongenecker1 If I posted a clown mass would that be fair game for the same reason? Or would that be an unfair outlier? I would argue the latter, an unfair outlier. So is the ROTR. Not in any way typical nor natural for the OF. Water finds the middle.
@RichardRubinDC He doesn’t have to be talking 70 everywhere. A rate that high is easy to campaign against.

@dlongenecker1 full disclosure: my parish has a reform of the reform novus ordo very much like this one. there probably isn't one like it within 500 miles. i'd be shocked if there were more than a dozen in the whole country.
@dlongenecker1 pretending that a reform of the reform Novus Ordo is in any way commonplace is inaccurate. the problem is that the Novus Ordo can be what we see here, or it can be a clown mass. most often, it's a mauve, mail-it-in affair with altar girls, EMHCs, EP2, bad music, and boredom.
@dlongenecker1 what percentage of Novus Ordos do absolutely none of the good things we can all identify in this mass? i'd venture a guess that 99 percent do none of them. so how is putting this out there any more of a Novus Ordo defense than a caricatured clown mass is a serious objection?
@RichardRubinDC i would love for them to adopt this thread's plan: 70 percent top rate, 70 percent CIT/dividend/cap gains integrated rate, carryover basis with a death tax, a new army of IRS agents, 70 percent pass through business tax rate. would likely double federal taxes. batshit insanity.
A good, non-controversial definition of a bad tax reform plan is one that raises the top marginal tax rate while simultaneously gutting the tax base and leaving average rates unchanged. And yet that's precisely what the AOC/House Dem 70 percent top rate and uncapped SALT plan is.

@Brian_Riedl @brendanmdunn @DouthatNYT @TuckerCarlson The zero bracket/standard deduction doubled for working families—their first $24,000 earned is tax free. The child tax credit doubled from $1000 to $2000 per child. The 10/15/25 brackets are now 10/12/22.
@Brian_Riedl @brendanmdunn @DouthatNYT @TuckerCarlson The TCJA actually INCREASED the percentage of federal income taxes paid by millionaires. That’s right—the tax code got more progressive.
@brendanmdunn @DouthatNYT @TuckerCarlson On the margin, five figure married wage earners face a tax rate of 12 percent thanks to tax reform. That’s half the 24 percent tax rate on capital gains and dividends, and a third the level of the 37 percent top tax rate.
@brendanmdunn @DouthatNYT @TuckerCarlson The average effective income tax rate for a median income family of four is now 3 percent, cut in half from 6 percent before the tax law passed. It’s 24 percent for top one percenters. The argument that we screw the middle class  on taxes is absurd.

@dlongenecker1 It’s not that we think you’re anti-TLM, at least speaking for myself. It’s that you haven’t given up the ghost on the NO as an objectively deformed version of the Roman Rite. I was ROTR right with you and worked my way past it to TLM only. Give it time and you will too.

@krezmien No one serious is making a validity argument. That’s a straw man.
@dlongenecker1 Just don’t call him “prophetic”
@redeemedrachel @BillyBassic It’s not “being your own pope” to go to the Mass the Church had for 1900 years. You want to see being your own pope, check out how most priests celebrate most Novus Ordos. It’s a choose your own adventure story.
@biggsag @ToddHagopian So partial theft
@ElizabethKantor @SteveSkojec Because Catholics aren’t the Church. You can bind yourself to a made up standard if you want to but “give money to your bishop” is not the precept.
@cassielafasto @tonyapc42 He gets to fabricate his own little mass, within boundaries. A priest at a TLM has zero options.
@cassielafasto @tonyapc42 A priest at a NO chooses whether to sing mass propers or hymns, which penitential rite, often which readings, which preface, which Eucharistic prayer, which Memorial Acclamation, whether to have a sign of peace, how to distribute communion, saint or Féria, east or west.
@ElizabethKantor @SteveSkojec The precept is to support the Church financially. It’s not to support a particular parish or diocese financially.
@dlongenecker1 You are not demonic. You are a good and holy priest. And dead wrong about the TLM. I was right with you pre-Francis. This pontificate has forced me to give up the ghost on ROTR Novus Ordo thinking. The whole thing needs to be overturned.
@tonyapc42 @cassielafasto What does pride have to do with anything? I’m making the pretty simple point that at a Novus Ordo the priest gets to be in charge of the liturgy, and at a TLM the liturgy is in charge of the priest.
@cassielafasto The priest has so many options at a Novus Ordo he gets to be a kind of master of ceremonies. At a TLM, the priest has no choice. He can buy any car he wants as long as its black.

@fortyhigh @TaylorRMarshall How many of the 11,500 Jesuits are over age 65? I’d guess a lot more than half.

@AndrewPetiprin The problem with the Novus Ordo is that the priest at that Mass gets to be his own pope. And that’s the problem.
@danevandyck @kpomerleau The House Rules Committee get around anything. In the Senate, when it comes to 60 vote points of order I defer to @Brian_Riedl and others. But suffice to say there are plenty of supermajority hurdles in the Senate.
@kpomerleau so what I'm hearing is not so much that you're against the 3/5ths rule, but that you're against supermajorities (which in any event are a Senate issue since the House has a Rules committee that routinely waives points of order).
@danevandyck @kpomerleau Senate budget rules make it easier to raise taxes/harder to cut taxes.		House 3/5ths rule is a mirror equivalent. Intended to make it harder to raise taxes.		Majoritarianism is fine but it's got to swing both ways.
@kpomerleau Imagine lawmakers are about to pass your ideal tax reform in the Senate by a few votes.		Now imagine that the reform cuts $1 of net revenue.		Would stopping that reform be justified? Budget POOs and MTP/cloture does just that.		Difference is 3/5 majority protects taxpayers.
@canonlaw @dlongenecker1 i honestly don't understand the argument that the Novus Ordo is simpler than the TLM. the many choices involved in the Eucharistic Prayers, Penitential Rite, and readings alone make it far more complicated. The TLM is one text, the same always and everywhere.
@danevandyck @kpomerleau kind of like budget points of order and MTP/cloture rules in the Senate. so what's the difference?
@kpomerleau what is wrong with a supermajority requirement to raise taxes?

@oldbrit2011 @mamreilly @dlongenecker1 this is the typical spin of the vaticantwoist liturgy crowd. it pretends that the Novus Ordo is no big deal, nothing to see here, same old development of the Mass like always. that's obviously wrong, not only in how the mass is celebrated but even in the texts. it's man-made.
@oldbrit2011 @mamreilly @dlongenecker1 Take a look around, pal. The new Church your generation sang into being with a Coke and smile is falling apart. Those of us who inherited your smoldering wreck are trying to fix it. All we ask is that you stay out of our way. Have a tapioca pudding on us.
@oldbrit2011 @mamreilly @dlongenecker1 Pius X was really concerned about operas happening during Masses. should I be skeptical about the TLM because of that historical note, too? Neither do I evaluate it based on your mid-20th century American experience. it's irrelevant.
@oldbrit2011 @mamreilly @dlongenecker1 i don't care what your parish was like in the 1950s. we're talking about a nearly 2000 year old liturgy celebrated much differently today than in your youth. get some historical perspective. we don't care about your childhood.

@dicentra33 @matthewschmitz Were we ever really allies?
@TaylorRMarshall This will be reflected in the larger Church. Our 500 or so Sunday TLMs in America won’t grow much. But tens of thousands of Novus Ordo Sunday masses will go away as parishes close and Sunday schedules shed mass times. We win by showing up. Just a matter of time. Build from there.
@matthewschmitz the Francis Effect is that the conservative Catholics have become more traddie, and the liberal Catholics have become more heretical. The "uneasy alliance" Douthat wrote about was uneasy indeed. In a way, the Francis era has been a refreshing air-clearing of all the polite lies.
@pontificatormax @TaylorRMarshall don't worry about the Jesuits. They are all old. Many/most of those 11,000 are in retirement homes or making plans to get there.
@matthewschmitz gee, i wonder why
@TaylorRMarshall Prediction: in 10 years, all those numbers will be about the same except the Jesuits, who will be less than the Dominicans. The trad (FSSP, SSPX, ICKSP) and conservative (OD, OP) will grow in relative terms as the Left (SJ) withers. That's how we win--same size fish, smaller pond
@hamstanger @dlongenecker1 What am I doing? I'm the top donor to my parish and sit on the Finance Council. I'm a top donor to my diocesan scholarship fund. I'm raising three young Catholic girls in the TLM and their parish school. How about you, pal?
@hamstanger @dlongenecker1 let's take a non-liturgical example: RCIA. no distinction is made between candidates and catechumens. it is dominated by laity in most places. the materials are vaticantwoist. best to do private instructions and the baltimore catechism. radically different than RCIA.
@hamstanger @dlongenecker1 it comes down to this: traddies don't think minor changes need to be made. the edifice that's been built is just not reclaimable.  we need a totally new (old) paradigm. tinkering with what we have won't cut it.

@dlongenecker1 you're right about the purge. like purgatory, it's a cleansing fire. we should welcome it. but it's not just the Latin Mass we traddies are prescribing: it's getting rid of the entire damn edifice of modern Church thinking. the Mass is just the hot button of that. it's everything
@dlongenecker1 And remember the “Tipping Point” theory of big changes. 100 percent of those leaving are Novus Ordo attendees. 100 percent of the masses that go away when a parish closes or reduces the schedule are Novus Ordos. Meanwhile the TLM gets bigger and younger all the time.
@dlongenecker1 I actually view the purge we’re in the midst of as providential. Those 80 percent of Catholics who don’t ever go to Mass are not really Catholics. If some of the 20 percent join their ranks, so be it. We don’t need weak sisters.

@TimothyDobbs58 @1dudette @dlongenecker1 It is my Mass. It’s my birthright you Boomers denied me and I found in the attic. I’m the Count of Monte Cristo.

@cactusdtd @TimothyDobbs58 @szaner15 @dlongenecker1 That’s a unicorn mathematically and you know it.
@TimothyDobbs58 @szaner15 @dlongenecker1 I’m sick and tired of hearing how the Baby Boomers’ childhood liturgy means the nuclear bomb that happened to our Church is somehow justified. It isn’t.

@AmericanPapist Or worse, unpaid.

@NKaeding Nope.

@DCLatinMass Look, we all know Jesus was gay, ok?
@jcsumers @disciple96 @fidelispatre Pretty easy solution to that: EMHCs don’t need to exist.
@redeemedrachel @fidelispatre Why do it at all?
@TimothyDobbs58 @dlongenecker1 No one—absolutely no one—disagrees with the idea that a Novus Ordo CAN be done in a way that apes the TLM. However, we all know it almost never is. Most, in fact, are train wrecks. That’s the real world. Take the red pill. It’s easier.
@TimothyDobbs58 @dlongenecker1 All i know is that nearly every Novus Ordo is a disaster and every TLM is great. I’ve stopped fighting the obvious.
@TimothyDobbs58 @dlongenecker1 im sure a lot of people left with all the changes back then. but to remember the Mass before 1965 (when those changes started), you have to have been born in 1960, you need to be in your 60s or older today. The NOM did all its damage to those younger than that.
@danieldbunn @RameshPonnuru @brendanmdunn "that was a lovely Advent party you had."

@dlongenecker1 12. The NO is simpler? Really? There is a three and a two year reading cycle. There are three penitential rites. There are over a half dozen EPs. Hymns can replace propers. Psalms can be swapped in. Each mass a snowflake. As opposed to one set of texts, the same always/everywhere
@dlongenecker1 11. Did the Church attract more or fewer converts now vs before the Council? Did the Church lose more or fewer people now vs before the Council? If the NO is so attractive, why is the second largest denomination "ex-Catholics?"
@dlongenecker1 10. Hymns are for the Divine Office. Even in the context of the Novus Ordo, why should a hymn ever displace a mass text? Yet that happens 99 percent of the time for the Introit, the Offertory, and the Communion antiphons. I have no objection to hymns just before or after Mass.
@dlongenecker1 9. Adaptability means the Novus Ordo CAN do all of those things, but how often does it? In practice, far less than 1 percent of Novus Ordos actually do all the traditional things you describe, making them range from annoying to unattendable. 99 percent of the time it's done wrong
@dlongenecker1 8. The offertory prayers. Are you kidding me? This is one of the most earliest-criticized texts of the OF. There's a reason the Anglican Ordinariate liturgy allows the traditional offertory as an option. Most view the older prayers as more sacrificial.
@dlongenecker1 7. "Bringing up the gifts" is not the same thing as a solemn offertory procession. It's just an excuse to give the laity something to do. If you wanted to swap it with sacred ministers processing, I'd be open to that. But that isn't what ever happens.
@dlongenecker1 6. "The prayers of the faithful are often abused." I think you just made my argument for me.
@dlongenecker1 5. there is a gospel procession in a Solemn High Mass. The deacon brings the Evangelarium to the north end of the sanctuary and chants it.
@dlongenecker1 4. the "more Scripture" argument was the last Novus Ordo ghost I gave up. the fact is, no one remembers the Second Reading. and the three year cycle means most people don't retain the main gospel pericopes. Humans can only handle so much. Just ask 401(k) plan choice folks.
@dlongenecker1 3. ever seen the "mass on a World War II tank" photos? how about the JP2 on a canoe photos?
@dlongenecker1 2. the flexibility is what has given rise to the liturgical abuse. if the last 50 years have taught us anything, it's that flexibility breeds abuse.
@dlongenecker1 1. the liturgy in the vernacular is a bad thing because while latin words and meanings don't change, vernacular words and meanings do. so you never have to stop tinkering with it. endless liturgy committees and fights. plus the vernacular isn't a reserved sacred language.
@dlongenecker1 you simply cannot be accurate when you say that you've never heard good text arguments against the ordinary form: Father Z, Peter Kwasniewski, and Gregory DiPippo have all done tons on that subject. I know you must read those guys.
Some people brag when they hit #InboxZero. I brag when I hit #podcastzero. Is this a thing for anyone else? It tends to happen predictably for me over the Christmas break and then again after the NFL draft.

@joshuamercer That’s in a world where a majority of Catholics are actually Catholic. That’s over double the percentage that are now.  Add those up and you’re talking about one non-Sunday every 3 weeks on average, except for that stretch during Holy Week. And I’m flexible on the Easter Octave.

@joshuamercer In an ideal world, every first class feast day would be a holy day of obligation, along with the truly huge ferias (Ash Wednesday, Holy Week, and All Souls). In the world as it is, it should be the top 10 or so. Epiphany is, and today ain’t.

@tomecurran @Dan_Shaughnessy Imagine if either BAL or IND was in the AFC East all these years. Or if HOU was in an AFC Central this year. Or if NO and LAR were each in the NFC West. Bloodbath divisional fights. Playoffs before playoffs.
@tomecurran This all started when we went to four-division conferences. If we still had three divisions, the @Dan_Shaughnessy AFC East critique would go away, as would 8-8 division winners. Make division championships great again.

@jmculling @FrJoshMiller The idea is that having both species communication is a “fuller sign” of the Eucharistic doctrines. Academically that’s true. Practically it’s become a disaster. Spillage. Need for extra EMHCs. Other sacrileges. A bad idea. Host is 100% Jesus. PB not additive.
@aborunda @DavidGMichael74 @dlongenecker1 There’s a big difference between a liturgy which is apostolic in origin and changes VERY slowly over 1900 years, and one which is hastily written in a year or two. Don’t pretend otherwise.
@BornAgnCatholic It’s been my experience that a parish with a regular TLM is pretty hardcore at every mass. It infects the whole parish with high octane Catholicism.
@jmculling @FrJoshMiller Minor exception for celiac communicants, of course.
@jmculling @FrJoshMiller No precious blood communication outside of the priest. One of the two dozen variables at a Novus Ordo which are invariable and uniform at every TLM all over the world every time.
@BornAgnCatholic https://t.co/HiTzGCDHjy
@BornAgnCatholic Think about this: how would you put your odds of staying out of mortal sin between now and the end of your life? And now think about that without recourse to Confession. Trust me on the TLM. It’s a sure refuge from the current bullshit.
@aborunda @MenAreLikeWine_ @dlongenecker1 If you want to believe it’s still doing something—I’m not sure what since Christ is the fulfillment of it—I suppose that’s a harmless belief. I also don’t know what relevance it has.

@aborunda @DavidGMichael74 @dlongenecker1 Fabricated is just another word for manufactured. It’s made of human hands. As opposed to received from the tradition. It’s not a pejorative. But committee-drafted liturgy is not the Catholic way. Received liturgy is.
@aborunda @MenAreLikeWine_ @dlongenecker1 What’s the point of the Old Covenant now?
@aborunda @DavidGMichael74 @dlongenecker1 You asked me for something which was fabricated in the Novus Ordo and I gave you one. There are dozens of other examples, most notably the non-Roman Canon Eucharistic prayers.

@aborunda @MenAreLikeWine_ @dlongenecker1 I believe everything the Catholic Church teaches. I also default to being Catholic in a way that’s handed down in tradition. What’s your problem with that?
@aborunda @DavidGMichael74 @dlongenecker1 Yes. One example of many is Penitential Rite C. Tell me it isn’t fabricated.
@aborunda @dlongenecker1 Only on Twitter can “eating the whole cow” be called sedevacantism.
@aborunda @MenAreLikeWine_ @dlongenecker1 Was the Church incomplete in 1962? If it’s developed organically since then, what am I missing out on? What developments particularly that were not as developed back then?
@aborunda @MenAreLikeWine_ @dlongenecker1 What is lacking in my Catholic orthodoxy if I ignore the last 60 years? Specifically?
@aborunda @DavidGMichael74 @dlongenecker1 I assume that when a mass (in any form or rite) is consistent with the tradition received it is better than when innovation and fabrication sneaks in.
@aborunda @dlongenecker1 Traditional Catholics are not capable of doing that. Conservative Catholics might, but they are as conciliar as the liberal Catholites are. We eat the whole cow.

@MenAreLikeWine_ @aborunda @dlongenecker1 An orthodox Catholic doesn’t have to accept anything that’s happened since 1962 and they are still fully orthodox.
@dlongenecker1 @MenAreLikeWine_ @aborunda The last straw for me was the Wikipedia paging of the Catechism on the death penalty. This was supposed to be a sure guide to Catholic teaching. The Anglican Ordinariate converts signed it! And then heresy is inserted on capital punishment. It’s all up for grabs for these people.
@dlongenecker1 @MenAreLikeWine_ @aborunda So it would have happened anyway? I used to believe that “documents of the Council” fairy tale, too. But it doesn’t hold up. All the changes started then and every single one was done in the name of the Council. It was a nuclear war level disaster. Much easier to reject it all.

@DavidGMichael74 @aborunda @dlongenecker1 I think God cares about liturgical abuse, yeah. You’re speaking as if most Novus Ordo masses are just fine, and in the vernacular. We all know there is a lot more going on than that.
@aborunda @dlongenecker1 I don’t deny any doctrines. Why are you assuming I do?
@aborunda @dlongenecker1 right back at you, how can the Catholite liberals be considered Catholic when they deny core doctrines and even dogmas of the faith?
@PetriOP preaching!
@aborunda @dlongenecker1 i don't do any of those things and I'm a traditional Catholic. The Novus Ordo is inferior but not invalid. The "reforms" of Vatican II have by and large been a failure but legally imposed. The pope is just another bad one that we haven't had in awhile.
@jdflynn @PetriOP if you were to be a deacon, please please please be sure you are trained to be a deacon and subdeacon in a solemn high mass. that, combined with basic gospel chanting skills, are the primary limitations of permanent deacons today.
@PetriOP in the Novus Ordo, diaconal homilies should be safe, legal, and rare. i have seen it used well when the priest does not speak English as his first language, for example. but it should definitely be by exception. it's also good for transitional deacons in summer assignments.

@wlbeeton @HJWallEcon @johnkartch higher taxes. higher spending. pretty simple.
@wlbeeton @HJWallEcon @johnkartch revenue neutral pigouvian taxes might be interesting to talk about. the carbon tax is not revenue neutral unless paired with dollar for dollar offsetting tax relief. your preferred plan does not do this.
@HJWallEcon @wlbeeton @johnkartch indeed. why hide behind terms like "fee" (when it's actually a tax) and "dividend" (when it's actually a welfare transfer check)? it can only be because you're unsure the public will support it if honestly described. yellow jackets in france says you're right.
@HJWallEcon @wlbeeton @johnkartch the carbon tax is to the green left as amoris laetitia is to the liberal pope francis Catholic left. fundamentally dishonest, language euphemisms that mask deeper issues, and barely concealed cultural marxism.
@wlbeeton @johnkartch have you had any experience with government finance at all? im not aware of any argument that a transfer payment means that payroll taxes aren't taxes, or that entitlement benefits aren't spending. showing that it's a transfer payment is not responsive.
@wlbeeton @johnkartch maybe you have some ideological hangup on social security. how about gas taxes and highway bill spending? is the gas tax not a tax, either?
@wlbeeton @johnkartch at least you admit your religious preference (worshiping the earth) is what actually is driving you here. tell me how the CBO score right in front of your eyes is wrong. tell me how a simple carbon tax isn't one just because you spend it.
@wlbeeton @johnkartch you're either not capable of having this conversation or you're being trollishly evasive. social security payroll taxes are taxes, just like a carbon tax. social security benefits are spending, just like carbon tax welfare checks. absolutely no difference.

@wlbeeton @johnkartch by your logic, social security payroll taxes aren't taxes, either, since they are immediately returned to seniors in the form of Social Security benefits. but of course no one serious disputes that we're dealing with a tax system and a spending program there.
@wlbeeton @johnkartch i understand the bill very well. the "fee" is a polite term for a tax--no one seriously disputes the tax nature of it. that money is then spent by the government on a welfare check to households. what's not to get?
I might actually root for @NDFootball @NotreDame if it were still a Catholic school. https://t.co/LDLBxDomxr
@johnkartch @wlbeeton it's certainly possible to design a revenue-neutral carbon tax: plow all the carbon tax dollars raised into tax relief dollar for dollar. this is never actually done in these plans, since doing that would mean non-taxpayer seniors, kids, etc. would get screwed.
@johnkartch @wlbeeton A tax increase combined with a spending increase is not a new or innovative concept. George McGovern ran on this very policy ("Demogrants") in 1972. This time, it's just gussied up in quasi-religious piety toward environmental imperatives. The Left's religion is environmentalism.
@johnkartch @wlbeeton Warren, your argument makes no sense. If taxes go up on net, whatever happens from there is by definition not revenue neutral. Net taxes have risen. You advocate pairing this tax increase with a welfare spending program to make the whole thing budget neutral.

@RichardRubinDC Then it begs the question what the safe harbor is referring to when it references PTE level excise taxes imposed by states.
@RichardRubinDC It’s no different, except in the four walls of the safe harbor. The excise tax is fully protected, and the general income tax is simply not mentioned. Gives a clear path to states to set up revenue neutral PTE excise taxes, kind of like non-resident PTE owner withholding.
@RichardRubinDC My next goal: get Virginia to pass a 5.75 percent excise tax on PTE profits, fully creditable at the owner level. Other states should do the same. No SALT cap for biz owners that way.
@matthewschmitz @SohrabAhmari @austeni @DawnofMercy @Pontifex @CatholicHerald People will lie and smear others just to protect this pope.
@iPadre @fatherz I hope but this man is the enemy. I can’t believe any good can come from him.
@RichardRubinDC But the safe harbor only applies to a PTE if the state chairity credit is offsetting a business-only tax. It specifically does not safe harbor owner income taxes.
@daveweigel A GOP majority would never have the balls to do this despite rampant election fraud among the Democrats. Of course, what they do on Indian tribes and inner cities doesn’t usually influence House elections.
@RichardRubinDC left unanswered, of course, is the much more interesting question: whether and how a pass-through can donate to state charities AND take an ord/nec deduction (say, for advertising) AND use the full state tax credit for owner liability.
@ccpecknold this might be the most disturbing thing I have read in this whole rotten year in the Church. during Confession!

@jiwallner @joshuamercer @brendanmdunn You’re talking like it’s close. It’s a rout. No amount of floor time is going to get us the 10 or more votes we need. You know this since you’ve been in this game a long time. Our honest supporters out there don’t. False hope is not a favor to them. It’s cruel.
@jiwallner @joshuamercer @brendanmdunn This whole “we have no idea if we might win” facade is the false hope base-baiting I keep referring to. You know full well we don’t have the votes and should not be telling the base we would if we just fought harder.
@joshuamercer @jiwallner @brendanmdunn It will be Republicans having to sustain it. The Dems won’t play. Also, remember how a “real filibuster” worked out for us in 2013. Cruz promised that doing so would stop Obamacare. It didn’t do anything except beat Cuccinelli.
@PetriOP The “in house” argument is one we’re going to hear more and more of. We all know what purple and crimson clad types you’re talking about “out of house.” My parish has a way to donate that remains totally in-house, too.
@joshuamercer @jiwallner @brendanmdunn You seem to labor under the idea that doing so will make them vote for a wall. If we were in the minority and that was done to us would we vote for gun control or abortion? “Fight harder” remains a non-plan to win and very poor math. Needs 60.

@FieldRoamer We don’t have two moderate parties. We have two parties with fundamentally incompatible views of government. The result of that is most often stalemate, not compromise. That’s a good thing—Congress passing laws is usually bad for the country on net.
@FieldRoamer It takes 60 votes to pass an approps bill. Like it or not, that means Schumer has a seat at the table. The only way around that is to invoke the legislative nuclear option, which makes no sense with the House about to flip. And the wall is a bright line for Schumer.
@FieldRoamer It doesn’t do you or me any good to pledge to dunk a basketball when we’re never going to be able to do that no matter how hard we try. Reality matters. Do the most we can with what we have, and don’t blame others because we can’t dunk the ball.
@FieldRoamer I suggest passing the best bills we can with the votes we have. And then getting more Republican Senators. See how much easier a time we will have on judges with 53 instead of 51 GOP Senators. Same with other issues.

@BrianJohnsonMPA I recently caught up with a college buddy who is now a high skilled immigration lawyer in Philly. He said that job creating Indians and Pakistanis are being treated the same as the caravan. He voted for Trump but he’s beyond frustrated.
@BrianJohnsonMPA And then the instigators of the pre-doomed shutdown will blame Leadership instead of their own dumb strategy.  You’d think the conservative grassroots would catch on one of these times that they are being played for fools by these snake oil salesmen.
@FieldRoamer There’s a concept: recognizing that the other team has the votes to block us. Much better than a #fightharder non-plan to win.

@matthewschmitz Get us a Republican House and more than 51 Republican Senators. We never had the votes this Congress. Don’t buy into the demagoguery here.
@kpomerleau It definitely makes the dividend more progressive, but the knowledge that it’s taxable should make it even more unpopular politically than a carbon tax regime already is. It’s such an Acela Corridor conceit.
@RichardRubinDC @kpomerleau When I was in high school, I learned that the media cared more than the country about the environment, campaign finance reform, and gun control. It’s how i learned the pitfalls of preference/intensity in opinion polls. Duped by preference, no intensity. Still holds up.
@kpomerleau Right, it does do that. But notice how proponents and the media never tell people you don’t get to keep your whole dividend. Some will have to give back half of it. Top bracket high state tax types.
@kpomerleau It also claws it back. Also “less horrible” probably a preferable adjective to “better.”

@brendanmdunn @rachelbovard @ahrferrier @StevenTDennis A better way to be a hardcore conservative is to FIRST identify what is possible given the votes we have and THEN help get that list done. Coming up with fantasyland demands unhinged from vote really is not productive.
@brendanmdunn @rachelbovard @ahrferrier @StevenTDennis There’s no plan to get these things done. There’s plenty of whining and rock throwing at Leadership, plenty of intangible insults about “fighting harder,” but never an actual plan to get the votes needed to pass these lovely dreams.
@rachelbovard @brendanmdunn @ahrferrier @StevenTDennis In a 51 vote Senate, yes. In a 53 vote Senate, probably not. This is nose counting. It’s not about “giving” anyone anything. All your complaints would be solved with more Republican Senators elected. So work on that and be productive with your time. Don’t base bait.
@rachelbovard @ahrferrier @StevenTDennis @brendanmdunn And in this Senate as constituted, is there 50 votes for Obamacare repeal? Is there 50 votes for further tax cuts? Collins, Flake, Murk, Corker all immediately come to mind as no votes. If not, why are you telling our base we can? That’s just as bad as running on PP defunding.
@rachelbovard @brendanmdunn @ahrferrier @StevenTDennis What’s eligible for reconciliation that we didn’t do AND has 50 Senate votes? Not Planned Parenthood. Not Obamacare repeal. So what else?
@rachelbovard @ahrferrier @StevenTDennis @brendanmdunn You can’t do discretionary spending on reconciliation, so that’s the Wall. And do we have 50 votes in this Senate to defund Planned Parenthood? Collins, Murk alone bring you to 49.
@brendanmdunn @ahrferrier @rachelbovard @StevenTDennis The base baiters like to tell our supporters that IF we just got some balls and shut down the government THEN we could fund The Wall with Planned Parenthood’s money (or whatever). That’s simply untrue. Still takes 60 votes. Shutdown is just a virtue signal. It’s a con job.
@rachelbovard @ahrferrier @StevenTDennis @brendanmdunn Kavanaugh took 50 votes. The wall takes 60. Suggesting to the base this is a matter of will when it’s actually a matter of votes is dishonest. Stop lying to our base about what we can do.
@rachelbovard @ahrferrier @StevenTDennis @brendanmdunn Good or bad, I’m interested in the theory of the case as to how we win as a result of doing it. What’s the strategy?

@BruceBartlett @roddreher You’ve got to be Catholic the whole way. It’s a demanding religion when it’s done properly. It makes radical claims on you. No picking and choosing.
@BruceBartlett @roddreher Forget about if the average person can do it. Pick the two best Biblical scholars in the world. They have a disagreement. Where do they go? Obviously the Catholic Church: our guys wrote the last third and canonized the first two-thirds.
@BruceBartlett @roddreher Correct, and they are wrong for the logical reasons we likely agree on. If you interpret the Bible in way X and I interpret it in way Y, what happens then? Only the Church that gave birth to and in some cases wrote the Bible has the authority.
@BruceBartlett @roddreher At the Pentecost moment of the Church’s birth, it possessed the full deposit of faith. Nothing can change from there. Teachings can develop, but never in such a way that they corrupt into contradiction. That’s why Francis is such a catastrophe as he tries relentlessly to do this.
@BruceBartlett @roddreher The Church precedes the Bible, or at least the New Testament. The Church started at Pentecost—11 apostles and Mary in the upper room. Grew from there. Eventually wrote the Gospels and epistles. The Bible is dependent on the Church like the IRS instructions are on the IRC.
@BruceBartlett @roddreher As a matter of prudence, it should follow that women with deep seated sexual attraction should not put themselves into that kind of environment. And the Church has always taught that homosexual sex is a sin, no matter who does it. We don’t proof text the Bible like that.
@BruceBartlett @roddreher Similarly, alcoholics should not become bartenders. Drug addicts should not work in pharmacies. Straight married men should not live in all girl dormitories. And gay men should not join an all male priesthood.
@BruceBartlett @roddreher The clear solution to the problem is the one Pope Francis and his predecessors have dictated: men with deep seated homosexual urges are unfit for the priesthood and should not be ordained. Those already ordained should be cared for but removed from ministry.
@BruceBartlett @roddreher I’m not sure how you’re getting there. Rape is a crime and should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. But the genus of the rape in question is not pedophilia. It is the rape of one gay man against a teenage boy or young adult man. Lots of denial here.
@BruceBartlett @roddreher Some like Pope Francis, his liberal allies, and the gay rights movement desperately want to pretend this is about little kids. The data says that just isn’t true. It’s about predation of sexually mature males by gay priests. The solution is obvious.
@BruceBartlett @roddreher Having sex with a sexually mature person isn’t pedophilia. It may very well be illegal, but it’s a different sexual genus. This is largely a set of cases involving gay priests exerting power over sexually confused or gay young men. McCarrick targeted adults.

The 20 year average forward P/E for the S and P 500 index is 17.2. A ratio of 15 or 16 implies that prices have room to grow, assuming corporate earnings bear out.
@StevenTDennis Not saying forward is for sure. But my read of them says that stocks are very undervalued. Those cheerleading a flat year for stocks because it hurts Trump will look awfully silly this time next year.
@StevenTDennis Is this forward?

@MarcGoldwein I’m calling balls and strikes. I’m saying Trump has no real plan on Social Security and Medicare. But I’m giving him credit for being for the repeal of the Medicaid expansion and Obamacare. Who is good on all four?
@MarcGoldwein The only thing worse than that is someone with no plan on Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and Obamacare. And who does relative virtue signaling on taxes and defense while promising free Medicare for all. In other words, Trump’s 2020 opponent.

If it’s too good to be true, it probably is. Congress setting a tax at 0 percent isn’t the same as repealing the tax. The whole case is built on that. I wish I was wrong but I really don’t think I am. https://t.co/reILnHDM62
@_caleborr Also, what would your answer be to the criticism that dividends and stock buybacks already have the same tax treatment? They both use after-tax corporate dollars and the same investor tax rate applies from there.
A model is @amconmag which is a thriving model of paleoconservatism and serves as an incubator for younger traddiecons. No reason that can’t be replicated with conservative writers with a TWS worldview. Not saying it’s easy, but very possible if Trump detours can be avoided.
There’s a market for an online publication which is smart, urban, fiscally conservative, neoconservative, pro-life, and Trump-skeptical. That’s a big part of the conservative movement. But it needs to move on from Trump-centric criticism. https://t.co/S0i4Its1aD

@adamnmichel @Heritage_Action @BudgetHawks @iteptweets @FreedomPartners @AFPhq @EconomicPolicy @uspirg That’s the 2026 extenders package! To me, the answer to all these things is to adopt a current policy baseline and stop pretending things are going to expire. And if we don’t like an extenders package, come up with some alternate annual revenue vehicle shell for Congress.
@adamnmichel @Heritage_Action @BudgetHawks @iteptweets @FreedomPartners @AFPhq @EconomicPolicy @uspirg PATH and TCJA did a lot to make the extenders package matter less. CFC lookthrough and active financing exemption is transcended. AMT patch doesn’t matter. R and D is in TCJA. Biggest drivers are gone.
@adamnmichel @Heritage_Action @BudgetHawks @iteptweets @FreedomPartners @AFPhq @EconomicPolicy @uspirg From a policy perspective that’s true. But that December revenue vehicle also helps Congress finish up other things. Back in the pre-EGTRRA days, the package was kind of like how it is now—must pass, not really controversial, and a thorn in the policy comm’s side.

@MarcGoldwein @lenburman Right. And the CMS actuary said it reduced the long term imbalance. The means testing overwhelmed the doc fix part. This is especially true if you assumed a current policy baseline (doc fix every year piece by piece).
@StevenTDennis @MarcGoldwein @lenburman You guys don’t have a problem with me. You have a problem with @Brian_Riedl. And may God have mercy on your souls.
@MarcGoldwein @lenburman In exchange for making something that was going to happen every year anyway permanent (doc fix), we got deepened means testing in Parts B and D, and some other cuts to boot. I’ll take that deal any day.
@MarcGoldwein @lenburman What i know is that the actuaries scored the bill I lobbied for as reducing the long term unfunded liability of the Medicare system, under either the current law or the likely policy baselines. Which is a lot better than what any Democrat is proposing these days. Also no taxes.
@MarcGoldwein @lenburman How did that bill score in the long run actuarial estimate CMS did?
@lenburman But as @Brian_Riedl has shown very well, the driver of the long term debt is absolutely those four spending programs and not anything else even close. And the Dems have zero plans to address any of them. Let’s not take our eye off the ball of what drives debt.
@ThFinalCrusader @FrAquinasOP @RaymondArroyo Yeah that was 20 years and several bishops ago.
