Hillary has not driven a car since the  80s. She says she knows the middle class? #debate
A few special forces will not provide the overwhelming force needed. We need appropriate force package to provide medivac, QRF, etc. #debate
Two of my brothers died in #Benghazi during Hillary's political career. Where was that on the sound bite list? #debate
Hillary also lied about being under sniper fire in Bosnia. I was on the tarmac sitting in a lawn chair. No shots fired. #StolenValor #debate
We have to make the tax code fair and much much more simple. The complexity makes everyone a defendant or a suspect in the IRS's eyes.
Did Hillary Clinton just blame Honest Abe for her lies? #debate
Montana law enforcement cite huge quantities of cheap meth from Mexico as the no 1 reason for the epidemic. Need to secure border. #debate
FBI agrees: Current vetting is inadequate. A bipartisan veto-proof House majority voted to stop it and fix it. #SAFEAct #Refugees
Smart move talking about Bernie Sanders criticisms of Clinton. Bernie won Montana. #debate
Bill Clinton rightfully pointed out ObamaCare is a disaster. #CraziestThing #debate
Great question on #obamacare not working. In Montana 58% rate hikes. Need to repeal and replace #debate

My gut feeling: I don't think it's any coincidence N. Korea and Iran are both flexing their muscle on nuclear capability.
I've personally vetted ppl in the Middle East. Sen. Kaine does not understand the process. FBI wants to fix refugee vetting for a reason.
Senator Kaine is mistaken on Israel's position on Iran. I've personally spoken to IDF and Netanyahu.
Governor Pence is the Rock of Gibraltar. Very strong performance tonight.

Excuse me Hillary Clinton but Iran is "taunting" us. Have you even picked up an intel briefing in the past six months? Or maybe the NY Times
Clinton says we have to work with our allies to get intel, but under her "leadership" our allies don't trust us. Great plan.
Clinton defends Obama, not American troops. Not becoming of a commander in chief.
Hillary Clinton has no plan to defeat ISIS. Just like she didn't have a plan to save my brothers in #Benghazi. #debate
