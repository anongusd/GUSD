@tedlieu @GOP @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Self-righteous enough?	Be careful not to get altitude sickness up there on your moral high horse.
@PieFan3 @projectantifa @feloniousfox2 @joe_montague7 @SenBobCasey Me as well.	Would rather read the full spectrum, even source materials/studies, and come to my own opinion/conclusion vs being spoon feed crap "they" want us to blindly believe.	Sadly, in doing so, I have become very jaded re the lack of honesty/integrity in reporting &amp; politics.
@tedlieu How you have the nerve to preach to your colleagues on their/your oath when you and your liberal colleagues mock it every time you speak on gun legislation is beyond the pale.
@PieFan3 @projectantifa @feloniousfox2 @joe_montague7 @SenBobCasey One thing I appreciate about Fox is they are obvious/direct in that they swing right.	Whereas CNN et al try to claim impartialilty when obviously are not.	Needless to say, most don't bother covering real news (hardly at all) anymore anyway and is all talk show/opinion garbage.
@heyitsjuliej @RepLoriTrahan @RepDonBeyer Yes, but when Rep Trahan posts something she opposes and then calls for more women "at the table" it implies that simply by being a women they would/should agree with her position - which is not accurate.
@PieFan3 @projectantifa @feloniousfox2 @joe_montague7 @SenBobCasey I don't think any are "fake news" per se, but I do think bias creeps into their (some) writing/reporting and some have lost their objectivity.	What is silliest is they are too insulated in their bubbles to realize it or they know it and don't care.	Don't know which is worse...
@JohnLAlford2 Still no, but what is more amusing is your original reply.	Either you happened across a tweet from a year ago OR you read a current tweet, didn't like it &amp; went through a year worth of tweets so you could reply snarkily vs being direct.	Happy to discuss the former not the latter.
@ChrisMurphyCT Wow, so your position is NOT to invest in mental health or any efforts to try and stop these deranged people from committing these crimes in the first place BUT to give people time to run away during a reload?		You need to rethink your priorities.
@Twitter 	Is there a way to create a second timeline, possibly moving certain followed accounts into that timeline so that the main timeline isn't crowded with accounts that send out massive amounts of tweets?	I still want to follow them, but would like to categorize them.
@JohnLAlford2 Umm, since your response has nothing to do with what I was driving at your silly attempt at an attack against me falls flat.
@projectantifa @PieFan3 @feloniousfox2 @joe_montague7 @SenBobCasey I am no fan of anyone/group that follows blindly without using critical thinking to cultivate their own opinion - regardles of "side".		What really bothers me is pols/media who spew this factless, biased drivel.  They should know better and be held to a higher standard.
@PieFan3 @feloniousfox2 @projectantifa @joe_montague7 @SenBobCasey Hi PieFan,	Sadly, I think being intellectually lazy is becoming more common across the full spectrum.		Interestingly, applying it to just Trump, his supporters and the religious right is intellectually lazy - no?
@RepCohen It's about money, you know it and even said so...	Now you are trying to race-bait the issue?  Why?
@SpeakerPelosi @RepDwightEvans @JoaquinCastrotx @realDonaldTrump I am happy you recognize this sworn oath - now remove your gun legislation bills from consideration and force CA to overturn it's absurd gun laws as well.	Or does this oath only apply when you "want" it to?
@RepLoriTrahan @RepDonBeyer Soo, if more women were "at the table" and these additional women also agreed with Trump, you would be fine with this because there are "more women at the table"?
@CBSNews Such an amazing story - to have found a once-thought extinct bee and the journey the team took to finding/photographing yet the best you can come up with is this garbage?	You can do better.	Where is Tony Romo when you need him?	He seems to be the only shining light on your team.
@CBSNews There was absolutely no need to include the ONE line from Live Science calling it a "nightmare" bee.	What a pathetic ploy for clicks.	The photographer of the bee has stated how docile this bee is compared to other aggressive bees, yet you completely ignored this.	Pathetic.
@CNN I dunno why I expected this story to include the details surrounding the question at hand - is she a birthright citizen OR the acts/messages she posted supporting ISIS...	Ohh wait - it's CNN - nevermind
@davereaboi @JackPosobiec @pspoole @NPR had an in depth story on this and the many other people who have asked to return to the US after leaving to join ISIS.	As well as the number around the planet that have asked to return to their "country of origin" - the numbers are shocking.
@JackPosobiec Not a very reliable article, in it they claim the US government declared CAIR a terrorist organization.	Not a fan of CAIR, but would like to see the source on this, otherwise it is sloppy writing...
@NBCNews We need a national minimum "wage" per tooth - this is unacceptable!	@SenSanders, we need your help!
@SenKamalaHarris Wrong.	Car producers are looking for a federal standard instead of a patchwork of state sol'ns.	CA continually obstructs against the interest of the country and you have gall to blame fed?		Typical CA, thinking they know what is best for everyone else.
@ewarren Ohh my goodness...	The highest standards of accountability?	This coming from you is rich.
@MSNBC Nice background images of POTUS.	Your team must be proud.
@ABC7 Sadly, imagine how much we do not catch...
@WSJ Wow, just wow.		And the media loves to say they provide, fair, ubiased news...		Nice headline and sneak-peak blurb WSJ...
@KamalaHarris Don't forget about tackling the national crisis of "big-gulp" style sodas.	Yes, this is your state Sen. Harris.
@AOC I agree gun violence (and threat of) is not a game which is why we need politicians to stop bs'ing around with nonsense gun laws currently being pushed &amp; focus on mental heath, suicide prevention, gang/drug violence, domestic abuse etc - these are the real drivers of gun violence
@JackPosobiec Jack, if she is a birthright citizen, she cannot have her citizenship revoked against her will.	If she is a naturalized citizen, she can potentially be denaturalized.	If she is not a citizen - moot point.
@nytimes Interesting timing of thos article considering the recent requests from female ISIS fighters to return to the country they defected from.
@ChrisMurphyCT Fantastic!	Finally, someone willing to invest in mental health, suicide prevention, gang/drug crime prevention, domestic abuse...		Oh wait - you want to ban threaded barrels and folding stocks?	Nevermind, you don't actually care about the solving the real issues.
@SwissTechie @CNN Hi Daniel,	I am not sure what policies you are referring to - can you elaborate?	It is my understanding that the US laws are intentionally very limited with regard to extraterritorial jurisdiction.
@CNN Thank you @ABC for doing what CNN did not and report on additional facts/details regarding this story.	https://t.co/VMTwuutJ6T		Sounds like she is not a birthright citizen.
@SwissTechie @CNN Wow, just read on https://t.co/8zriT945wh...		"Natural-born U.S. citizens may not have their citizenship revoked against their will, since birthright citizenship is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment to the Constitution"		Learn something new every day		https://t.co/TWmvlQF24K
@USATODAY @GavinNewsom 	How quickly you forget...	https://t.co/Qh7xvWlrBu
@CNN CNN, I wish you would have reported on what happens to US citizenship when you leave (renounce?) the US and join a terrorist organization.	Is it automatically revoked?  If not, why not? Etc.
@TIME Yeah, okay...	India is a great place to visit... unless you are a woman or a child.
@Reuters @ReutersTV On an aside...	If you knew 80-90% of the money you earned was going to be taken away for "re-distribution" OR as some politicians have suggested, just cap your earnings to a "fair" amount - would you feel the need to work as hard, be one of the best in your industry?
@Reuters @ReutersTV Ohh nooo.	Don't tell Bernie Sanders.  He will want 80% to "fairly" distribute amongst those he feels deserve it more.
@ewarren @PodSaveAmerica @TVietor08 @jonfavs @jonlovett Thank you for voicing your opinion and keeping your message on point as to what our country really cares about...		Oh wait, what?  Dogs?  Jon Lovett?  		Nevermind.
@PattyMurray Rutroh, I just heard another person support his declaration which negates your person.	Better go find another person to quote...		It's sad you feel this is the best way to make your argument.		You really need a better PR team.
@NPR Your point?
@PieFan3 @feloniousfox2 @joe_montague7 @SenBobCasey As I hear it, and please let me know if wrong, since an "assault weapons" ban does not prevent you from hunting, and others "can" hunt with a bolt-action rifle, it is okay.
@feloniousfox2 @PieFan3 @joe_montague7 @SenBobCasey I am not a proponent of an assault weapon ban.	What I am sincerely interested in re this conversation is that PieFan is obviously a hunter/gun owner and has thought on these issues yet has opinions in stark contrast to mine - ie his want to ban all semi-auto rifles.
@PieFan3 @projectantifa @feloniousfox2 @joe_montague7 @SenBobCasey Woah, struck a nerve?	I was not saying the 2nd Amendement is all that matters re Constitution - what I was saying is that in regards to guns (protection of ownership) it is what matters.	The threaded barrel was to highlight what is actually written in the ban re assault weapons.
@NPR @NPR 	Also, why didn't you press Andrew McCabe when in one moment he says it was never a serious idea to follow 25th Amendment YET he welcomes testimony re questions on why they were discussing in first place...	Come on NPR - I like listening, but you need to dig a little more.
@NPR	Just heard the interview you completed with Andrew McCabe.	Wish you would have pressed more on his statements that the wire was an off-hand comment yet at the same time was brought up several times and discussed with attorneys.	Which is it?  Off-hand comment OR serious idea?
@LarryDDutra @NBCNews ...as adults, right?
@projectantifa @PieFan3 @feloniousfox2 @joe_montague7 @SenBobCasey Project,	I am not represented in your example.	Unfounded statements such as "all the illegal guns in Mexico are made in America" make it challenging to have a conversation as it shifts away from the discussion at hand.
@PieFan3 @projectantifa @feloniousfox2 @joe_montague7 @SenBobCasey The 2nd Amendment is THE most important thing.	I see politicians wanting to infringe on it without actually caring about reducing gun violence.	Making a threaded barrel illegal isn't going to stop violence, so their "ideas" are only to prey on emotional fears NOT solve problems.
@PieFan3 @feloniousfox2 @joe_montague7 @SenBobCasey For me the major issue has nothing to do with the type of already legal gun, it has to do with people who commit these horrible acts.	Mental issues, gang/drug issues, domestic violence - these are what gov't needs to focus on - not banning a style of firearm.
@PieFan3 @feloniousfox2 @joe_montague7 @SenBobCasey I am surprised to hear you say this &amp; am really trying to understand this logic but considering the vast majority of gun homicide is by handgun, to hear you want a "semi-auto rifle" ban but not a handgun ban makes it hard as it seems less about sol'n and more about emotion, no?
@PieFan3 @feloniousfox2 @joe_montague7 @SenBobCasey Hi PieFan,	Genuine question - what about handguns?  Are those allowed?
@amyklobuchar Sen. Klobuchar,		Interesting you are working to campaign on such a platform.		This certainly wasn't the case when you ran for Senator.		What has changed and why should people believe you are not tied to big business/PACs when you used them to start/advance your political career?
@ABC ABC,	@NPR had an interesting report on China and the World Bank.	Would be interested in hearing more digging/details on this - it's implications, reasoning behind and potential fallout if China gets grumpy with World Bank.	Care to take the lead?
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump ?	Ted, are you trying to make a joke?	I would say stick to politics but your history proves you are light on politics and heavy on insults, so it wouldn't help you much.
@myeucatastrophe @NashMoneyTalks @ewarren This is your response?	Trying to equate followers with meaning something?	Congrats to you, you have more followers &amp; congrats to me, for this response from you.
@NashMoneyTalks @myeucatastrophe @ewarren Stacy, do you just make things up in an effort to win an argument/prove a point?		Releasing taxes is a "tradition" that was a stunt by Ford for his campaign.  	There is no law requiring the release of taxes to the public.		On an aside - I am fine with carrying on the tradition.
@ABC7Veronica @ABC7 @OnTheRedCarpet @TheAcademy We're NOT were
@MSNBC And yet the media freaks out when people say their reporting is garbage.
@amyklobuchar Way to lay out your plan in clear detail - very impressed 😒		What's sad is that even when you try to send out tweets to pat yourself on the back, you fail and show your ignorance.		Yikes
@NBCNews Sad.	Even when you cherry pick a border city trying to find examples to prove your narrative, you fail.
@amyklobuchar Blah blah blah
@abc7JoshHaskell @ABC7 @SenWarren Wow, amazing how a line of hundreds looks like 20 to 30 people.	Crazy how cameras do that.
@ChrisMurphyCT This is a joke tweet, right?	What about Obama's apology tour?	There was a news segment recently by a retired 4 star general - not a Trump fanboy - yet he even gave credit to Trump's foreign policy efforts.	What other POTUS has opened negotiations with DPRK?  Called out China?
@SenGillibrand Still wrong!	How about:	Need to make student loans available for bancruptcy like any other debt	Need to remove gov't/college tuition inflation system	Provide additional funding for cost reduced/free education for needed students	Etc.	So simple - you should try harder
@ChrisMurphyCT Interesting how the dems work so hard to twist the narrative away from facts towards baseless, ridiculous claims.		Is there some playbook, written in crayon, that is passed around amongst dems once elected into office?
@SenGillibrand You have to be kidding, right?		This is your sol'n?		The gov't shouldn't be in cahoots with higher ed to drive up tuition costs in the first place.		Learn your history and the facts before making such asinine statements.
@SenGillibrand I agree we need to strongly support our schools and teachers.	We also need the gov't to get out of states way in regards to determining what actions are best for their schools.	Individual communities need the ability to determine their own needs, not big gov't.
@RepBrendanBoyle Did you even read the article in your rush to tweet garbage.		They even state the poll was heavily skewed away from republicans and that Trump, not having completed his term, make poll results dubious.		New poll of myself:	You tied for the worst member of Congress - congrats 😊
@MSNBC A split?	BP never fully supported Brexit in the first place and didn't think it would pass.	Once it did, they worked half-heartily on negotiations while whipping up anti-Brexit sentiment to bolster efforts for no deal.	Both Corbyn and May are to blame for failing their country.
@SenJeffMerkley have*
@SenJeffMerkley You have to be kidding!	Trump demands a border wall and all of a sudden, "Ohh, I am on this, time to figure out what is going on in these countries".	Pathetic.	We has known for years.	You just never cared enough until Trump forced you into action.		"Stay tuned for more"  - plz
@ChrisMurphyCT Sen Murphy,		You are in Congress, you should know the facts regarding the reasons behind gun violence.		Is this just another banal tweet by an uneducated PR department or are you really ignorant of the facts?
@kronos7777 @ChrisMurphyCT Nope.	Try again.
@pecriel @ChrisMurphyCT @NRA @GOP Wrong, simply wrong.
@thecatcompany @ChrisMurphyCT Wow, so the tens of thousands of dollars out of millions it takes to run a campaign is "buying" these politicians? 	Wow, the NRA is really getting a great deal when pennies on the dollar has that much influence - shocking.		Learn your facts
@brooksturner @ChrisMurphyCT @NRA Blame the NRA, typical.		The NRA spends next to nothing trying to lobby the gov't as compared to others.	Also, if hate idea of "lobby" money, have to stop Bernie Sanders from taking his Soros money as well as all the others.		Such a silly argument.
@TheSilentNight @NPR Hi Jasion,	Yes, I agree companies may not need the incentives, but that is how our gov't has made the laws and regulations work.	As for CA - amongst polled CEO's, CA is consistently the worst state in the US for business.	Other factors included - CA is little better than middle.
@CALI51870143 @KimStrassel @realDonaldTrump @WSJopinion No it wasn't.		CA didn't even want it.  It was a slow-train joke.		On an aside, guess who won the first segment contract?  Diane Feinstein's husband.  What a shock!		Thank goodness the Jerry Brown turdline turtle train is done with.
@PattyMurray You don't believe in the Constitution, so why do you care?
@MeetThePress @NYCMayor Mayor,	You sir are wrong.	Amazon has every right to leave a deal with NYC if they choose.		Go back to working on soda bans and other nonsense.
@ABC7 Ban snow, it is too dangerous!
@SenGillibrand Your PR team needs to go back to school.
@RepCicilline @davidcicilline Classy as always, hey Cicilline?
@KamalaHarris Fixed your ending:		...as well as ensure only legal voters are those casting ballots and that those ballots are cast in their designated precinct.
@RubinReport Wait until you get back to CA...	Good luck.
@abc7amy @ABC7 Ban all cars, they are too dangerous.
@SenGillibrand What women-hating megadonors were looking to support your campaign until they found out you support women?	If you think this is the messaging that will win you votes, you need to fire your staff and try again.
@ChrisMurphyCT In history? Wow!	Didn't know history started in 1880.  Thanks for the lesson.
@prageru What about big business and ag industry lobbying gov't to stay out of illegal immigration issue?
@RepColinAllred Rep Allred,	You have this all wrong.	You need to get the Fed out of loans in the first place.	-Fed subsidizes Universities	-Universities bloat tuitions &amp; push loans on students	- Fed, seeing they own most debt, make bankruptcy illegal	-Fed/Colleges skyrocket tutitions for $$$
@JackPosobiec I should start talking about wanting 90% discount on a new 2500 diesel GMC 😀
@PieFan3 @joe_montague7 @SenBobCasey Hi PieFan,	So your issue is that many firearms are semi-automatic and should be banned from the public because you don't see their need while hunting deer?	This is such a silly argument.	Guess using a classic Browning BAR is out of the question.
@amb573 @hughhewitt Haha, sadly no.
@PieFan3 @joe_montague7 @SenBobCasey What does bagging a deer have to do with this conversation?	Is the 308/7.62x51NATO a good enough caliber for deer?	What about the .243 or 7mm-08?
@BreameWicks @SenBobCasey Ok, let's go with your logic and say that occurs - how will that lower the majority of gun violence in this country?
@sindymellon @hughhewitt Of the almost 40,000 gun deaths, some estimate that up to 80% are committed with illegal firearms.
@KittyColeman15 @hughhewitt Sadly, politicians do not want to tackle the real issues of gun violence.
@RickFlowerday @hughhewitt Sadly, gun homocide rates are almost 40,000 per year with nearly 2/3rds being suicide.	Imagine if we invested in suicide prevention and what impact that would have on gun violence in America...	Too bad politicians do not want to tackle the real issues.
@amb573 @hughhewitt Actually, overdose death and injury has now surpassed firearms.	https://t.co/W0sXLkLMg5
@hughhewitt Hugh,	Interesting read on drugs via our borders: https://t.co/W0sXLkuaRv		My question:  We know massive amounts of drugs we stop, but overdose death/injury has now surpassed cars &amp; guns.	How much are we not stopping &amp; what area of border are these missed drugs sneaking through?
@ABC7 Considering the increasing regularity of these reports showing massive amounts of seized illegal drugs attempting to be smuggled into the country - imagine the amount not found...		Makes you think.
@IngrahamAngle Of course Laura.	Everyone knows it is okay to ask questions of consevative politicians regarding potential nepotism, but heaven forbid you apply those questions equally to all politicians.
@SenFeinstein Gotta gather that political stumping data, hey Feinstein?
@NPR NPR, thank you for linking on twitter.	I listened to your reporting on this via the radio.	Most shocking, according to your reporting - Dixville Notch didn't seem to think it was a big deal.
@JackPosobiec 	Hey Jack,	Having difficulty finding a full text (without need to download) of the omnibus spending bill that was signed this week.	You have know of a link where I could view?
@mohdux2 @NPR Interestingly, NPR earlier this week had a great radio spot on how food is desperately needed, people are starving and Maduro has a history of distributing food for votes but now that this food is for Guaido to distribute, Maduro prefers to let people starve.
@davidcicilline @SenWhitehouse Come on David, we all know these are not military weapons nor is this legislation about tackling the real issues of gun violence.	This is nothing more than a way for politicians to act like they care and pat themselves on the back for media messaging.
@SenGillibrand Yup, whatever it takes to keep driving your narrative, right?
@OctansYoody @CoryBooker Will always have tragedy Yoody.
@SenFeinstein You make it sound like the gov't was shutdown for decades...
@SenGillibrand Wow, most disrespectful tweet I have seen yet from a politician re this tragedy.	Shame on you.	Have the decency to seperate this into two tweets.
@SenSchumer Senator Schumer,	I am not a fan of you nor your politics but wanted to say thank you for not pushing a political agenda in the same tweet where you express sadness over this tragedy.	Your colleagues should take your cue and learn how to show respect.
@PattyMurray I guess you are not allowed to be shocked or angry then.
@RepJerryNadler @HouseJudiciary I wish you would get this fired up when states and the federal gov't subvert the 2nd Amendment of that same document you reference.
@CoryBooker Senator Booker,		Please take a moment to refrain from pushing a political agenda while expressing condolences.		The media will always be pushing that narrative for you and you will have time in future to politic, but only a first moment to respectfully express sympathy.
@SenatorDurbin Senator Durbin's statement in a nutshell:		Let me first express my sympathy then use this tragedy to push my politicial agenda...		Senator Durbin - do you have no respect for those experiencing this loss or is it all about political agendas with you?
@NPR Huh, tell that to the film industry.		https://t.co/JiOXrhZ2Ix
@RubinReport MY GOODNESS!!		Only 10 people showed up to your event!!  *wink* *wink* 😜
@NPR Was*
@NPR Waa wondering how long it would be until a republican made such a statement...
@NydiaVelazquez @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump Interesting tweet.	Yes, you swore an oath to defend the Constitution...	How does this oath stack up regarding your views on the 2nd Amendment?
@RepAdamSchiff How sad it is that you do not understand the difference between semi-automatic and fully automatic weapons.		Why should the American people listen to you on this issue when you choose to show such ignorance?
@IlhanMN Interesting tweet...	So are you saying you support the POTUS declaration and such authority is granted OR you are being farcical and stating how silly it would be to declare climate change an emergency?
@NPR Hey NPR,		Why not look into and provide coverage for what created this bloated mess in the first place...		Gov't pushed loans to unaccountable higher ed who blew up tuition costs because gov't is paying them to do so with schools having predatory practices to push onto students.
@TrumpJew @JackPosobiec This cannot be real.
@cairGLA @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN My goodness no.		She may be speaking, but how "truth" will be included is debatable.
@Adam_Puzio @nprpolitics @NPR @NewsHour I don't think we should ban semi-automatic weapons. 	I do think that gun safety and training should be a focus.	I guess my original point back to NPR is that it is easy to put out these polls but without knowing the level of education on the subject the poll become moot to me.
@Adam_Puzio @nprpolitics @NPR @NewsHour We may not agree on all of those but I see where you are coming from.	Now, when people say 11 round magazines and assault-style weapons due to their features, what are your thoughts?
@SenGillibrand My goodness, really dove off the deep end on this one, didn't you.
@Adam_Puzio @nprpolitics @NPR @NewsHour Great, so you sound educated on firearms, and based on the above I am guessing you support background checks for all ppt's?
@PattyMurray So you invoke the Constitution when you believe it is in your favor but discredit it when speaking on gun control?		Which is it?  You believe or not?
@nprpolitics @NPR @NewsHour How about this challenge...		Educate the people in all you gun polls regarding existing guns laws, the constitution and gun violence and re-poll (if they do not already know - PS, I am guessing they do not).		Would like to see those results.
@nprpolitics @NPR @NewsHour Just based on the wording selected for the "poll", obviously someone who knows nothing of firearms created this garbage.
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump And you are a Senator?		Wow, you have no clue what you are talking about.		So according to you, the declaration of a national emergency with respect to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic was a declaration of war or required the use of armed forces?		Care to explain?
@SenatorDurbin Ugh, you are so naive.	Way to hurt Illinois and business orgs in your quest to pat yourself on the back and pander to ignorant voters.
@SenAlexander Get gov't out of giving higher ed bloated loans to drive up tuition costs would be a start.
@SenGillibrand Why are you so wrong, so often?		Do you intentionally hide your head in the sand or are you purposefully trying to not solve issues for some other ulterior motive?
@JackPosobiec 	NPR just said POTUS will sign legislation AND declare national emergency at same time...	Is it true?
@IlhanMN Wow, if accurate, tells me not to work for McDonalds unless I am one of 10%.  	See, problem solved...
@ProphetOfTru7h @NPR Can do.	Gun violence in this country is well documented and the majority drivers (to name a few) are suicide, domestic violence &amp; gang/drug related violence.	Existing gun laws in states like CA are a backdoor bans on 2nd amendment rights (1 example of many) and should be banned.
@DailyCaller @SteveScalise We need to hold these phony politicians accountable when they avoid the real issues and instead choose to fight against a bogeyman.
@DailyCaller @SteveScalise I believe that all Americans want to curb gun violence.	What is sad, is that too many politicians want to stump on nonsensical gun legislation vs actually fighting for action which could save American lives - mental health, gang/drug violence, domestic abuse - just to name a few.
@lifewithlarissa @SenFeinstein @RepMaxineWaters I dunno - possibly, but thank you for acknowledging missing my point.	Twitter can make it challenging to get a point across in detail and all too easy for only snarky comments to be made.
@IngrahamAngle Don't forget about HR 541 and it's presumption on dentention not being best interest for family unit.		Back door to ban detention?
@lifewithlarissa @SenFeinstein @RepMaxineWaters Hi Larissa,	1) I think you are missing what I am saying and 2) to dismiss her impact on homelessness in CA b/c she is a US Senator denies federal impact (which btw, had nothing to do with my original post).
@SenFeinstein Twice as fast?	Ummm, do math much?
@LeaderHoyer @HouseGOP Clever 😁
@lifewithlarissa @SenFeinstein @RepMaxineWaters Poverty and housing cost is a huge problem, along with mental illness...		If need specific example look to Feinstein's own state of CA.		She has been in office for over 25 years - what does that tell you about her ability to work on this issue?
@ABC7 This sweep...	Doing more to prevent gun violence in a single day than all of the legislation in congress right now.
@KamalaHarris Want to make real efforts to stop mass shootings?  Find ways to provide mental health to deranged people.		The idea that guns are evil and need to be banned is silly...		Way to use faulty logic to push an agenda that is NOT related to decreasing gun violence.
@SenAlexander What good is any of this when you have a system where the gov't pays universities to raise tuition without reprecussions and those bloated costs are pushed to students for a debt that even bancruptcy cannot remove?		Do you WANT tutition and student loan debt to get worse?
@PhiLisOnline @williamlegate @realDonaldTrump You are kidding right?		First off, my response was that CA is not a "donor" state, because it isn't.		Second, the notion that CA could "substain" itself is ludicrous.		Educate me, in your view, how CA could sustain itself?
@SenGillibrand Wooah now...		You want to tackle gun violence; tackle mental health issues, gang/drug related violence and domestic abuse - just to name a few.
@williamlegate @realDonaldTrump Wrong.	CA is NOT a donor state.
@jmandrewjr @prageru This is how to hold a business accountable - voicing objection by not supporting their business.		Now, if this was a liberal issue, they would want to sue, enact laws forcing business to comply and go crazy until it happened...		See the difference?
@RepAdamSchiff NPR did an excellent break down of this earlier today - nowhere in it did they discuss Manafort lying to protect potential presidential pardon...		Where are YOU getting your information from Mr. Schiff?		Care to cite or are you just running your mouth again?
@KamalaHarris Wrong wrong wrong.		Sen Harris,		You need to get your facts together and work on real change to curb gun violence and quit rallying for nonsensical legislation.
@SenBlumenthal You sir, obviously do not understand gun violence nor how to curb gun violence.		Soo, according to you, 10 rounds of ammunition is safe but 11 rounds is obscenely dangerous?		Pathetic.
@SenFeinstein Sen. Feinstein,		Don't forget that CA was subsequently unable to manage the pristine lands set aside in the Yosemite Valley Grant Act.		As a result, thankfully, the land was turned over to the federal gov't for protection to accomplish what CA could not.
@ABC7 Why not ban ALL meat and poultry products while at it?		Fur industry vs meat/poultry industry - which do you think is worse and more needing intervention?
@SenBlumenthal Read the proposed legislation.		Remove the presumption that families not be detained and it will garner more support...
@PattyMurray I could have sworn Congress has the ability to pass legislation regardless of POTUS veto...
@PattyMurray So you say you care about the health of our youth...	Does this ONLY apply when fighting against big tobacco/e-cigs?	What about the exploding rates of single-parent families?	Violence &amp; drug abuse?	Obesity?	Education disparity?	Violence in school?	Childhood poverty?
@AOC Misguided point.		This is like saying that an earthquake in SF would be more devastating today than in 1906 because of climate change...
@ChrisMurphyCT @Everytown If you want Fed Gov't to force states into universal background checks for private party sales, then you should also force states to abolish 1 in "X" day purchase laws and mandatory wait periods for purchases.
@ABC7 @McDonalds Another breaking news story!		Congrats ABC7 Eyewitness News.
@SenatorDurbin @RepSchneider As it it estimated up to 80% of firearms related crimes are committed with an illegal firearm, such legislation makes sense.	Kudos on getting something regarding gun violence right for a change.	Now stay away from pointless legislation such as an assault weapon ban.
@PattyMurray Am I in a time-warp bubble or do you keep sending out the same tweets, over and over?	Talk about rhetoric, jeez
@scdp @WhipClyburn Fixed it for you:	"Georgetown native and republican, Joseph Rainey was the first black congressman to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives.
@IlhanMN Last 2/3rds of this tweet should have been deleted.	Why must you play the victim and attack other orgs while attempting to apologize?

@SenSanders What then happens when goods and services rise in response?  A higher minimum wage to compensate?  	How about instead we provide services/education and foster prosperity not through handouts by supporting efforts to not need them in the first place?
@SenSanders Why does it seem your sol'n to everything is gov't should spend more money, create bigger gov't &amp; be nanny state?		If you succeed, what responsibility/accountability or self-sufficiency will people have?		Do you want people to be beholden to &amp; forced to live under gov't thumb?
@NSaneMotivation @SenKamalaHarris I too do not support Harris in her bid for POTUS - several of her policy positions along with her history are non-starters for me.  		As for Booker, I am not overly familiar with his positions nor history.		Something to look into - thanks.
@starkweather_b @JrPagits @AOC Everything a crime?  Be serious.	I agree changes are needed in the criminal justice system, but someome commits a crime, gets caught and &amp; we need to make it easier for future crimes to go unpunished? Plz.	You want to changes, fine, but pulling a CA (example) is NOT the answer.
@RepAdamSchiff *just*
@truth4president @RepRaulGrijalva @HispanicCaucus - I think most America would support.	Unfortunately, it seems to me, that is not what many politicans are trying to accomplish.
@truth4president @RepRaulGrijalva @HispanicCaucus Hi NAC,	Based on everything you have said and how I understood it:	If gov't reforms immigration law for those seeking entry, stops all illegal entry moving forward and create system for defined amnesty w/ criteria &amp; deportation for violators - all of which needs 100% enforcement.
@RepAdamSchiff Rep Schiff,	Did I miss something?  Is the US easing sactions without denuclearization?  	Or are you jist running your mouth again?
@SenAlexander I support fixing HEA, but you need to focus on why tuition is incredibly expensive in the first place.	Gov't intervention into a gov't created problem, as outlined by your 3 proposals is NOT the solution.	Get your head out of the sand.
@truth4president @RepRaulGrijalva @HispanicCaucus Hi NAC,	Interesting reply.	I do think we have to address the issue of current illegals in this country.  What that sol'n is, I do not currently know.  	To help me better understand what you mean - are you speaking to all current illegals or do you have requirements amnesty?
@NSaneMotivation @SenKamalaHarris I am not sure if you support or oppose, but in regards to her statement, my opinion:	I believe we need to do everything possible to assist someone needing medical attention, communication assistance at the border.	But, as this is only a statement, I do want to read the bill text.
@KamalaHarris Sen. Harris,	You co-sponsored The Assault Weapons Ban of 2019.	How will this measure help reduce that average of 96 people every day?	Is there some hidden evidence only you know about showing a threaded barrel or folding, telescoping or detachable stock is the culprit?
@truth4president @RepRaulGrijalva @HispanicCaucus Why?
@NSaneMotivation @SenKamalaHarris I dunno.	Once the text becomes available I will better be able to determine my interpretation on the effectiveness/impact of the legislation, but I won't rule out supporting something just because opposition sponsored - that would be pulling a Pelosi 😀
@NOT_HELLISH @positiv54591827 @SenFeinstein I thought is was nearly 40,000 gun related homicides per year.		Even more tragic, nearly 2/3rds are suicide and of 1/3 non-suicide some report up to 30% is gang/drug related and up to 80% of gun-related violence is committed by illegal firearm.		Sen Feinstein how will S.66 help?
@NOT_HELLISH @SeniorChief Chris may have been attempting to detail this:		https://t.co/sAlouX6vQ7		And this...		https://t.co/strQj1HE3o
@PattyMurray What about a Senator posting pointless tweets full of rhetoric and needless drama?
@SenKamalaHarris Sen. Harris,	Looking forward to reading the full text of this bill, once available.	If nothing sneaky in the bill which would limit ability of border patrol to complete job and it truly only a bill to provide language assistance and medical training incentives - kudos.
@SenFeinstein @SenSchumer @KamalaHarris @SenWarren @PattyMurray @ChrisMurphyCT @SenatorDurbin @SenBlumenthal @CoryBooker 		Do you read or know anything re gun violence in America?		Do your job and fix the REAL problems.	https://t.co/khRmALtbuL

@SpeakerPelosi @HouseJudiciary Instead of your useless gun legislation how about these ideas:	•Inner city investment/programs -stop gang violence	•mental health, domestic violence &amp; suicide prevention programs		These items will do more to prevent gun violence vs your garbage #guncontrol #realguncontrol
@SusanCu64779606 Hi jinx,	What, to you, is sensible gun control legislation you think should be passed and how would this help curb gun violence?
@politico And people wonder why tuition prices are insane. 	Blame the government and universities that are taking advantage of students.
@KamalaHarris And yet CA openly welcomes and assists in the creation of an underclass of people forced to live in the shadows.	Maybe less time calling out those trying to halt illegal immigration and more time trying to reform the system and stop illegal immigration is in order.
@KamalaHarris You forgot to add...	For years politicians pander and speak rhetorically and I, I will do more of the same.	Concise points of action I am taking to make changes?  	No, instead, I will speak on my favorite past time - political rhetoric.	Please do better - other polticians do.
@PattyMurray And yet you give us more rhetoric...		You have the space/characters, why not try tweeting about what are doing differently to change.
@flosey1965 I believe some people do, yes.	I am not saying folks in this thread are that person, but I do think sometimes people without understanding of subject are quick to judge/speak.
@jenimanon @hydar @flosey1965 @CBSEveningNews Hi Jennifer,	I think you hit on something.  	Many of voting public probably does not follow politics, not truly - yet they should.	Watching/reading the SOTU shows an involved voter, which is a good thing, regardless of political position.
@mariasviews1 @jenimanon @flosey1965 @CBSEveningNews Hi Maria,	I do read and listen and wouldn't presume you do not.	My point was that, unfortunately, many news orgs twist reporting to fit a narrative (especially headlines) and by listening to direct source you get best sense of true message, from both sides of isle.
@IGierzak @MaddieBarry8 @WhipClyburn Hi LucyD,	My belief is that most politicians do not care about stopping gun violence.  	I do not know their agenda but it isn't curbing gun violence.	Look at most firearms homicide then compare to legislation - it makes no sense.	If politicians cared they would do it differently.
@WhipClyburn Rep Clyburn,	I absolutely want to stop gun violence in this country but do not support the current proposed legislation, S. 66.	To me, the question to solve is WHY?  From WHY, we can work out the HOW.	Can you tell me WHY or HOW legislation S. 66 will work to stop gun violence?
@ABC7 My take?		Who cares, and why is a news organization reporting on this?		Just change your name from ABC News to ABC-WWE already.		Obviously it is not about journalism anymore but rather controversy, clicks and entertainment.
@PattyMurray Sen Murray,	Please include a link of what you specifically are doing to fix this issue.	You can hold a dog accountable for making a mess on your lawn, but that means nothing if you are not also working on a sol'n to correct the issue in the first place.
@SenStabenow Sen. Stabenow,	Interesting tweet.	Please elucidate - what specifically made you want to scream?	Folks in MI would like to know where you stand on such issues.
@DeadAlready76 @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Hi Dennis,	My point is this:	If you truly care about immigrants  and our country as Pelosi claims then you need both, zero illegal immigration and immigration reform.	Regardless of who leads the charge, as a politician you support that agenda b/c it is the right thing to do.
@Wiser_OH @vtxcafe @CBSEveningNews Hi Mike,	Yes that fence/wall was approved (whatever - people get so hung up on words 😀), but is my understanding most of that wall has been completed.  	What they now oppose is more b/c they find more pointless.	My stance is different, but that is their opinion.
@MmmtacosL @repbenraylujan Hi,	I think you may have misunderstood my post.	I support the end of illegal immigration.  Period.	I agree VISA overstays are a problem, among other issues.	I am not saying asylum seekers are an issue, I am saying a broken system and those which support that system are an issue.
@mariasviews1 @jenimanon @flosey1965 @CBSEveningNews The liar part is not my point, but regarding it being a waste of time is.	We may disagree but I think it is important to listen to both sides.	Do you follow politics?	If yes, where do you source your information from?
@KamalaHarris Mrs. Harris,	What does this statement mean? 		You may as well say, do you like sunshine?  Me too!  Join me and we will enjoy sunshine together.		Why can't politicians be straightforward?		Say - I support policy "X", if you do too, join me and we will fight together for "X".
@MmmtacosL @repbenraylujan Hi LA tacos,	From your response I cannot tell if you are being serious or not.	Are you in LA?  If yes, then you must know the issues illegal immigration creates.	Do you not support the end of illegal immigration?
@KamalaHarris Agree completely.	I would add, while running for potus, PLEASE be the voice of reason &amp; do not equate/conflate these terms to anything you disagree with &amp; pander to your base.	The American people are tired of the rhetoric.
@ec_laney 	Hey, my first like, thank you 😀.
@NydiaVelazquez @realDonaldTrump Rep Velazquez,	Why why why do you and other democrats love to conflate illegal immigration policy with immigrants?	Either you truly believe the American people are that stupid or you are too obtuse to see the difference - which is it?	Statements like this make you sound ignorant.
@jenimanon @flosey1965 @CBSEveningNews I would disagree.	You may not support POTUS, but watching any SOTU is a good thing - same as listening to those you diasagree with.	Hopefully you will reconsider.
@vtxcafe @CBSEveningNews Yes and no.	I agree certain points of the speech were very good - the aspect of Schumer etc supporting the wall before is inaccurate.	Trump corrected this narrative during SOTU.	They supported fencing for a segment that has nearly been completed - Trump added it was poorly done.
@mikedemo Cherry picking "facts" cuts both ways.  Believing or disbelieving a poll not for its accuracy, but your political leaning, is bad.	Also a statistically accurate and non-biased poll (not saying this is) is certainly more believeable than a person's opinion.
@JenniferWiggin @CBSEveningNews @RepSmucker Yes, lot's of ignorant people out there. 	Wonder how many people will read Huffpost/Fox etc. and formulate opinions on the SOTU without actually having watched the SOTU.	That is the real poll I would be interested in.
@50belowzer0 I found/purchased a signed book by Sumner Redstone "A Passion To Win" in a bookstore for $1.	Maybe I should give it a read.
@RepMarkTakano You seem to be conflating the idea of zero tolerance for illegal immigration with a notion that POTUS hates immigrants.	Zero illegal immigration should be a goal of America with strong, secure borders and open immigration reform.	Legal immigrants should be welcome with open arms.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Pelosi, you really need to get on board with the American people.	Border wall aside - you should be fighting alongside POTUS to end illegal immigration AND reform legal immigration policies.  	Do you enjoy creating a growing class of people, forced to live in the shadows?
@repbenraylujan Whether you agree with a border wall or not - illegal immigration IS a serious problem.	Not only the economic/criminal aspect, but the creation of a class of people forced to live in the shadows.	LEGAL immigration needs to be reformed and ILLEGAL immigration needs to be stopped.
@SenGillibrand I went to your link thinking I could just reply yes or no - instead it is a gimmic to get me to sign up.		My official response, now and when I vote.		NO		But you most likely will not even be on the ticket, so my sending this tweet was a waste of time.
@Twitter 	Just a thought but Twitter needs a way to give people sending out hatefilled tweets time to process before it is posted, and if they still decide to post, the post is flagged in some way the rest of us can see.	This whole, I am angry, must post now is getting terrible.
@john135795 No worries.	Yeah, I've been responding to these annoying politicians who keep beating the "hostage" drum as it irks me to think these politicians must believe Americans are that stupid and brainwashed.	...sadly, many Americans are.
@larryelder Hi Larry,	What if those who perpetuate victimhood actually are closet racists and don't realize their racism is subconsciously sneaking out in some Freudian way?
@CNNSitRoom @wolfblitzer @tedlieu Mr Lieu,	Are you truly that dense?	This is ALL on Congress!	Boohoo, Trump says he won't sign a bill - override him. 	Instead it's "hostage" this &amp; that.  You, @SpeakerPelosi et al. must think America is stupid.	What dunce told you it would "play well" to keep up this shtick?
@john135795 I agree completely.  When I read your original tweet response, it wasn't clear to me you where speaking of Congress, so I assumed otherwise.	To me, that's what makes this "hostage" name calling so silly. 	Pols must think the people are idiots.
@john135795 Umm, you said the exact same thing I said, but included a line implying I am an idiot...   uhhh yeah
@SenJohnBarrasso 	Hi Senator Barrasso. 	Just followed you and noticed you do not have a background image on your account.	Is this intentional?  If so, why?	If not - you should think of adding - looks awkward.
@AOC Read many of your tweets.	Not surprised by the misrepresentation in MSM but am surprised by the DSA claim.	Your positions vary situationally and Democratic Socialism restricts individual liberties.	Maybe "Classic Liberal Libertarian Liberal Quasi-Conservative Situationally"?
@Shahryar @AOC Apologies for repercussions typo
@Shahryar @AOC Forgiveness not answer, Gov't IS reason/problem.	Gov't backed loans created issue, pushing loans/tuition beyond inflation/earnings without reperecussion to Colleges.	WHY did Congress make bancruptcy non-op?	Financial Crisis redux - Gov't to blame.	Less Gov't not more is sol'n.
@john135795 Hi John,	You're kidding right?	1 of 3 doesn't control the money nor can fire the other two. 	In reality this issue stems more from Congress refusing to work together than Trump refusing to sign non-border funding legislation.
@reeses 	Stop with the "not sorry" commercials - they are horrible and annoying.  	What idiot approved this?  Whomever did should be fired immediately. 	I cannot imagine ANYONE liking these commercials - do a poll asking if it is annoying - I am sure most everyone will agree.
@RepLeeZeldin @SpeakerPelosi Rep Zeldin, I read in an article you mentioned a deal could be struck in 45 mins if you cut pay to Congress.	Here here - couldn't agree more!	Tell Pelosi to stop obstructing like a little petulent child and do her job!
@tedlieu @CovCathColonels You are soo out of touch with reality.	If these tweets are actually from you - you need help.
@RepJohnYarmuth This is a pathetic statement - you should be ashamed.	Why are so many politicians, yourself included, jumping the gun with these responses without learning the facts first!	Get your act together.
@KySecofState As KY SoS, you need to get your facts straight before jumping the gun to comments like this.	Either you or someone on your team needs to get their act togther.
@Cheryl50119834 @SenatorMenendez @SenFeinstein @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT @SenateDems @SenBooker @SenSchumer @SenatorDurbin @PattyMurray @SenJackReed @SenatorCarper Of course not.

@Ahnsael Definitely looking forward to it - please do not take offense on email thing.	I did want to say, as I can only speak for myself, there was a time when I felt God was not with me, then in one moment, what I always knew to be true but wasn't ready/able to believe, was....
@Ahnsael I do not know how to respond as I really haven't checked personal email, aside from few things here and there in many years - &amp; being new to social media &amp; wary of privacy concerns, I can only think to be honest.	I would feel a little uncomfortable, just now, sharing email info.
@Ahnsael My only thought was I agree.  There is something comforting in believing in God vs walking a different path, trying to be good and moral all while trying to find your way at the same time - my only response?	If you feel something but are unsure it is true, why try to walk alone?
@Ahnsael I appreciate that and I agree.	I had a neighbor in LA who is highly intelligent and we would talk on everything from God to Bernie to new ideas for inventions.  I always appreciated the conversations.  He once said something similar to you in that he wishes he could believe...
@Ahnsael I don't think I am educated enough on the subject to answer that, but I would ask how it made you feel to grant her that?
@Ahnsael Wow, read your posts and do not know what to say - sincerely, brought tears to my eyes.	I can say, and it may not bring solace, but I believe the evil actions of man will have God to reckon with.  To use God for their evil-doings is beyond disgusting.
@Ahnsael 	On an aside - you mention not being able to see the last eclipse.	I heard, if sky conditions are right this Super Blood Blue Moon might be visible for folks in the southwest.  		Good luck if you give 'er a go.

@jordanbpeterson 	Just saw excerpts from the geenstijl interview.	I must say, listening to you speak on the psychology &amp; methodology behind how you dissect/interpret &amp; respond to an argument/conversation was very insightful.	I would pay to learn/hear more analysis like that!
@jordanbpeterson 	Mr. Peterson, have general question.	Why would one claim to want change/equal pay yet decide to ignore your argument, instead choosing to lash out at you?	Would not a better sol'n be to listen/create change around factual wage gap driver.	Thoughts on why?

@benshapiro Just joined Twitter and along with our President, you are the second person I will follow.  	Sending this tweet to let you know the esteem you have earned by voicing your beliefs and opinions in a respectful, classy way! 	Keep up the good work!!
@realDonaldTrump Congratulations on your inaguration celebration today!  Amazing first year!!	Don't let the MSM and #fakenews make you think otherwise - majority of Americans support you. 	Stay strong on the shutdown, America knows it was dems fault #MAGA
