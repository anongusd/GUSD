@ADtheseries the apostles were luck because they knew Jesus (in the human form)and yet they were still humble
12/25 Born on Christmas, I should have know I was destined to spread God's Word.
God said ' in Jesus's Name Ask and you shall receive. Seek and you shall find. If you don't believe me, ask and seek.
God said 'Seek and you should find. I have witness God stopping Time.   Trust in our Lord and Savior
What God has created, no man or women can destroy. Have faith, patience, and trust in God.
