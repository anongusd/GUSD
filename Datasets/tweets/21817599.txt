@Bill_Dauster @eitanhersh @WatsonInstitute 2. ...that the Republicans in 2017  invoked the so-called nuclear option with a simple majority representing only 44.9% of the population. Then they used the new precedent to confirm Brett Kavanaugh with 51votes representing 44.3% of the population!
@Bill_Dauster @eitanhersh @WatsonInstitute 1.  A simple majority requires only a plurality, a quorum being present-- that's as few as 26 votes. So it is possible to reach a simple majority with senators presenting only 4.4% of the population. I don't much like evaluating democracy by abacus, but I would point out....

@profwschiller not counted in the DNC group are House members Senators Governors Former Presidents and other distinguished guests
@profwschiller 713 superdelegates, 432 DNC members including 75 folks picked by Wasserman-Schultz including big donors (source:Pew Research)
@profwschiller @BernieSanders Sure, but more than half of them are just DNC members.
15% of the Democratic convention are superdelegates. You needn't be a @BernieSanders supporter to think that frustratingly undemocratic
Lots of attention was paid to GOP nominating process when @realDonaldTrump called it rigged, but the Democrats' process is deeply flawed.
What @SpeakerRyan really wants of @realDonaldTrump is a confirmation hearing. One of those things we used to have for Supreme Court nominees

@davidhazony @ElizabethDrewOH Doesn't  make sense. Why would Reid offer to not filibuster and give R's vote w 60 threshold if order existed?
@ElizabethDrewOH @crankin1945 3. Dems may want  this deal because it's harder to get 41 to filibuster MTProceed  than up or down on passage.
@ElizabethDrewOH @crankin1945 2. But, leaders can't just do it, it takes unanimous consent.
@ElizabethDrewOH @crankin1945 1. Threshold for passage can be set at any level by UC.  They have even set it at 67 for a rules change.
@ElizabethDrewOH Setting threshold at 60 requires unanimous consent absent a filibuster. Majority ldr can force issue w cloture
@ElizabethDrewOH Unanimous consent required to set the threshold to 60 votes absent a filibuster. Majority ldr can force issue w cloture

@IanReifowitz You are very kind to say that... Let me know if you ever get back to Providence.
@IanReifowitz It is true that Hatch observed a less stringent blue slip policy- if home state senators were adequately consulted
@IanReifowitz @dailykos  My fear-simple majority cloture on judges will lead to further and more permanent politicization of fed judiciary
@IanReifowitz @dailykos Leahy seems to believe blue slip use/abuse is within norms.  We were not much better in 2005.

@DCreDC @jwpetersNYT @RobertsDan 2. Sometimes the minority is seeking negotiation &amp; the majority is obstructing to prevent amendments.
@DCreDC @jwpetersNYT @RobertsDan  1. Lone wolf filibuster may be self-evident but the intent of a debating minority isn't always.
@DCreDC @jwpetersNYT @RobertsDan  3. Counting cloture votes does not reflect # of filibusters.  Sometimes cloture filed with no filibuster.
@DCreDC @jwpetersNYT @RobertsDan 2. Not every filibuster leads to cloture- when Senate is working, it can lead to negotiations.

1. One of the great speeches in the Senate's history DEFENDING the FILIBUSTER Sen. Daniel K. Inouye 1/31/1963 http://t.co/M7QVO6uR
2.  Filibuster reform is NOT partisan- N. Mandela: "Where you stand depends on where you sit." Majorities all hate it- minorities defend.
1. Don't be fooled. Inside and outside the Senate some trying to wipe out the filibuster demonize bipartisan efforts at reform.  #filibuster

RT @MHarrisPerry: If you are not @UpwithChris you are missing the smartest take on the fiscal curb offered this week! #uppers
@upwithchris #uppers Chris: "always things not debated are the most dangerous" yet he opposes filibuster." Senate like House limit debate?
@upwithchris #uppers  Concerned abt "Who holds concentrated power" yet he would eliminate filibuster concentrating power in majority leader
@ezraklein 2.  It's ending the debate which requires a 2/3 vote.
@ezraklein 1. "Technically you need two-thirds vote in the Senate to change any of the chamber’s rules." Technically you need only majority.
Obama wins!  Biden too. (Biden just said so.)
2. Senators in past recognized need to balance use of filibuster with restraint to protect the right to debate. #defendingthefilibuster
1. Senate has always recognized democracy is a balance between majority rule and minority rights.  #defendingthefilibuster
@alexanderbolton  Not WHICH filibuster reforms but HOW. Nuclear option vs Senate rules. Bipartisan reform protects Senate's historic role.
This continues to miss the point.  It's not strong vs weak reform. It's following the rules vs breaking them! http://t.co/LcAmKque

Senate 89-8. This is a body that at least understands and is capable of compromise. House? Your move.
It is no accident that when compromises avert these various crises - they originate in the Senate. Ask yourself why. #defendingthefilibuster
@jaranathan I do.  Notice that these compromises always begin in the Senate.
@ezraklein: McCain "reform for people who don’t want to reform the filibuster."  What he means is who don't want to ELIMINATE the filibuster
@KagroX historically senators both valued the filibuster right &amp; recognized that the way to protect it was to use it sparingly.
@KagroX I would try not to.
@KagroX  I believe the act of reaching a supermajority on this - filibusters, holds &amp; trees will improve senators behavior which is the crux
@bindersab If by "skittish" you mean "wary"-- well they should be. The Founders wanted a wary Senate.
@ProfStevenSmith Not partisan matter. Senate avoids the damage of creating the "constitutional" option precedent.  This is a good thing.

@KagroX  Right.  But, we may get some moderate reform which in my view would not be a bad outcome. #defendingthefilibuster
@KagroX  again, we'll see if that logic prevails. The Senate way is to find a compromise. #defendingthefilibuster
@KagroX Ask the Senate parliamentarian or her predecessors. #defendingthefilibuster
@KagroX Rule V was a statement of the obvious to make it crystal clear where the Senate stood. #defendingthefilibuster
@KagroX  They were adopted in 1917 &amp; 1959 consistent with Art I Sect 5 and the existing Senate rules &amp; precedents. #defendingthefilibuster
@KagroX If the VP were to ignore that &amp; Majority Leader Reid has 51 votes, it can do done. #defendingthefilibuster
@KagroX  it's inconsistent with Senate rules and precedents, constitutionally established and in force. #defendingthefilibuster
