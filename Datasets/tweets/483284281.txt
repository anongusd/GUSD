Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh		I agree it is awful how all people involved have been treated by radicals (e.g., death threats).  However, GOP gushing over "poor Kavanaugh" and these awful few weeks.  How about Dr. Ford who has had decades of pain, plus an awful few weeks?

@Yongen_jaya @DailyCaller @Ocasio2018 Really?  That might be true- but I'm not the one that is talking Trash about the woman that graduated 4th in her class in a Top University with a Degree in Economics- the Guy with the History degree from a liberal arts college is.
@Yongen_jaya @DailyCaller @Ocasio2018 -So what exactly do you know about Democratic Socialism?  "Social democracy is a political, social and economic ideology that supports economic and social interventions to promote social justice within the framework of a liberal democratic polity and capitalist economy.-" https://t.co/zEQe1z4JXJ
@Yongen_jaya @DailyCaller @Ocasio2018 Well, I've been self employed since I was 19- owned 3 companies- retired at 41 -19 years ago &amp; own 4 homes two I paid cash for- and run a magazine now for fun with better stats than @DailyCaller - But this isn't about me-right?
@MichaelDent6 @Drew1Lawson @DryGulchMerch @MapleBmaple @seanhannity People in Wyomings vote Count the same as People in NYC- they Travel-watch news and their issues in most things are exactly the same.  EC was created because of North and South- The reasons for it don't exist any more.
@MichaelDent6 @Drew1Lawson @DryGulchMerch @MapleBmaple @seanhannity The issue is PEOPLE that live in California are from all over the country and people in Wyoming may have moved there from NYC It's a diffent world &amp; People have 24/7 access to news- All Citizens have a full vote- Not like slaves in 1800s-3/5- So there is zero need to have an EC
@MichaelDent6 @Drew1Lawson @DryGulchMerch @MapleBmaple @seanhannity Really?  Or did it have to do with Slavery &amp; Lack of Transportation &amp; communication in the Rural areas. Back then they were concerned that people in Rural area wouldn't have a clue about what was actually happening. Gee with Fox news it's clear the problem still exsts huh?
@rstatesman @DailyCaller @Ocasio2018 Yes I'm sure that 2.9 got you great placement in your family's business as a money lender-that GPA you couldn't get into BU- the average GPA at BU 3.6  she graduated 4th in class- I would bet she absorbed plenty- Since you aren't running against her maybe you can win ur own race?
@TreyMcMillan83 @DailyCaller @Ocasio2018 Well that's true- Except when you Gradute 4th in your class -and at 28 you just beat the incumbant and one of the top people in a political party expected to be house speaker. Then planting trees become less important and changing the world becomes more important.
@k_eckrich @DailyCaller @Ocasio2018 Yes, Jesse Watters is the Fox News guy with his Liberal Arts degree in History talking trash to a Hispanic woman that graduated 4th in her class from one of the top US Universities in Economics &amp; international relations-  You know that right? https://t.co/94fzT3mXl7

@Drew1Lawson @DryGulchMerch @dStroemsborg @orkinbugman @MapleBmaple @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump So what exactly does that have to do with the continued belief that Some people are "Illegal" I get undocumented- but People can't be illegal-When this country only exists because of Slavery-Genocide and exploitation of one group or another?  I guess I don't see people as illegal
@Drew1Lawson @DryGulchMerch @dStroemsborg @orkinbugman @MapleBmaple @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump So ur point is Johnny did a bad thing Which he was punished for-so u feel u can justify-continuing to exploit or consider one human inferior because Johnny did a bad thing?

@Drew1Lawson @DryGulchMerch @dStroemsborg @orkinbugman @MapleBmaple @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump Between 1525- 1866, in the entire history of the slave trade to the New World, according to the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database, 12.5 million Africans were shipped to the New World. 10.7 million survived the dreaded Middle Passage, disembarking in N America, Caribbean &amp; SA
@Drew1Lawson @DryGulchMerch @dStroemsborg @orkinbugman @MapleBmaple @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump Okay now that we have that cleared take a moment and watch the video- I'll be back in 20 minutes and we can discuss it okay? https://t.co/AFTyNZ7o1I

@Drew1Lawson @DryGulchMerch @dStroemsborg @orkinbugman @MapleBmaple @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump Did that blow your theory?   They wanted to get to China by sea without traveling around Africa or go theough the Middle east or the bandits of the Silk Road.
@Drew1Lawson @DryGulchMerch @dStroemsborg @orkinbugman @MapleBmaple @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump She wanted to get a Trade Route to China
@Drew1Lawson @DryGulchMerch @dStroemsborg @orkinbugman @MapleBmaple @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump Again- WATCH THE VIDEO it explains
@Drew1Lawson @DryGulchMerch @dStroemsborg @orkinbugman @MapleBmaple @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump America?  Or San Salvador? Columbus 1492    North America? 1000 AD Leif Eriksson
@Drew1Lawson @DryGulchMerch @dStroemsborg @orkinbugman @MapleBmaple @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump Boss that video is 20 minutes you couldn't have watched it- Please take a moment and get a different set of Facts.
@Drew1Lawson @DryGulchMerch @dStroemsborg @orkinbugman @MapleBmaple @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump Actually Most are from two Central American countries that went from Socailism to Right Wing Fascist Governments and Since we deported Young Gang Members there and we have a screwed up Drug Policy of Course Reagan-Clinton both had bad policies for them- They flee for their lives.
@Drew1Lawson @DryGulchMerch @dStroemsborg @orkinbugman @MapleBmaple @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump Again- We are not Overwhelmed?  there are 6 MILLION JOBS that we don't have workers for- More Mexicans are Leaving than Coming- But PLEASE take the time to ACTUALLY watch this- it will improve your knowledge on the subject Watch the WHOLE THING Please https://t.co/AFTyNZ7o1I
@Drew1Lawson @DryGulchMerch @dStroemsborg @orkinbugman @MapleBmaple @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump Really Worse? Developed nations? Canada? Mexico? Mexico outlawed Slavery - That's why Texas wanted to leave. Is Slavery wrong? Is Genicide Wrong? Who fought to end slavery? Who actually forced Human Rights? Because some of the people that were 4 Slavery are still fighting for it
@Drew1Lawson @DryGulchMerch @dStroemsborg @orkinbugman @MapleBmaple @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump LOL- here a fact that might make you stop and think for a minute- The entire world population (7 Billion) could fit into TEXAS and be less dense than NYC.
@Drew1Lawson @DryGulchMerch @dStroemsborg @orkinbugman @MapleBmaple @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump Actually we have an International agreement- 1951 Refugee Convention, https://t.co/AFTyNZ7o1I
@DryGulchMerch @Drew1Lawson @dStroemsborg @orkinbugman @MapleBmaple @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump No it didn't take Hundreds of year- to start taking land- That happened the First day- You might start with Jamestown and Plymouth, 1607-1620-  within 100 years we already had 13 colonies.  Pequot War 1630
@Drew1Lawson @DryGulchMerch @dStroemsborg @orkinbugman @MapleBmaple @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump I just pointed out- we AS A CONSTITUTIONALLY controlled and incorporated country. As a Country used slave labor and genocide to build it. Is that factually correct? A Democraticly elected government- justifed Slavery and Genocide-PS that make MOST of us immigrants-
@ndrew_lawrence I guess the lying goes unnoticed

How exactly does that work- You just walk up and they take your name? How many do they do a day? So it's that easy huh? https://t.co/kOwaWDaYKl
@Christian4XP @DailyCaller @Ocasio2018 Well I've been in business 30 years and I also know this- people said the same things about every social program in US history- We forget that we have Corperate Welfare- We blame the Poor for societies problems- yet Corperations-Banker-have controlled &amp; redistributed more wealth
@Christian4XP @DailyCaller @Ocasio2018 Canada is very Democatic Socialist in practice- Health Care Low price College- How do they rank in Polverty? Education? Healthcare?  I bet those pictures look like they could have been taken here- in this very Capitalist country right? 	https://t.co/iwhGERiFO1

@Christian4XP @DailyCaller @Ocasio2018 Did u see that one of the Devos Yachts went adrift-and at the same time some kid is sitting in a detention center wondering if he'll ever see his mom again. But hey someone makes money from the detention center that probably donated to a Senator in Texas 	https://t.co/o5Mi72uIaV
@Christian4XP @DailyCaller @Ocasio2018 So in comparison to the Rich? Which let's be honest Someone somewhere got exploited along the way &amp; Laws-economics of this country include Slavery &amp; Genocide - exploiting immigrant labor-  So again- The Democratic Socialists work to increase the MIDDLE CLASS which Unions created
@Christian4XP @DailyCaller @Ocasio2018 Yes &amp; Democratic Socialist say- Profit comes after we pay the % that we can collectively provide things that benefit the masses &amp; the well being of the country-like educating a healthy  feed workforce in a country that has an affordable safe transpotation &amp; infrastructue
@Christian4XP @DailyCaller @Ocasio2018 Does the person getting $12 an hour need food stamps-Welfare-Free Healthcare? Because if the person paying him paid him for 40 hours and he couldn't provde Food &amp;Healthcare -He can live in a tent-right? But why am I paying to bring him to a livable wage? Does store make a profit?
@Christian4XP @DailyCaller @Ocasio2018 You mean Church's and NGOs- because they are already doing the best they can- (I personally volunteer 40 hrs a week.) And the Government is putting in a lot and we aren't close to covering even the poorest of the poor. So ur solution is to take away that? How do people get "Poor"
@Christian4XP @DailyCaller @Ocasio2018 So we have a "Free Market" economy here?  Does giving Farmers money make it Free Market?  Do we have a strong Collective Barganing system to counter Greed or Thieft. Because Free doesn't mean the Wild West- it means WELL REGULATED-as not to exploit or endanger the worker
@Christian4XP @DailyCaller @Ocasio2018 Not Snarky to you, but to the concept that Capitalist do well with ANY IDEOLOGY -  People need to take care of each other a bit more. like in Monopoly- when the Banker holds all the money -the game isn't much fun for the rest of the players.
@Christian4XP @DailyCaller @Ocasio2018 First, actually Capitalism and Fascists work well together- Maybe you missed the 1930's in Germany- Ford- Texaco- IBM- GM-Alcoa Woolworth-You see Capitalist need CHEAP LABOR- if you can justify paying one Group less you can make more money- Greed has no Ideology
@OLDFLACO @DailyCaller @Ocasio2018 4th in her Class with an Economics degree in the 37th best Univerity in the Country-= Seems she has skill- She graduated fourth in her class from Boston University's College of Arts and Sciences in 2011 with a bachelor's degree in economics and international relations
@OLDFLACO @DailyCaller @Ocasio2018 Seems like to be 4th in the Class is hard- Boston University's ranking in the 2018 edition of Best Colleges is National Universities, 37. Its tuition and fees are $52,082 (2017-18).
@OLDFLACO @DailyCaller @Ocasio2018 The College of Arts and Sciences is Boston University's largest undergraduate school, offering Bachelor of Arts degrees in 23 different departments and 20 interdisciplinary programs

@orkinbugman @dStroemsborg @Drew1Lawson @DryGulchMerch @MapleBmaple @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump Wow- even the school that the POTUS supposedly graduated from says they are a Positive- WHARTON- you won't trash the POTUS' School right?  https://t.co/vNkYGAccIw

@orkinbugman @dStroemsborg @Drew1Lawson @DryGulchMerch @MapleBmaple @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump Let's see them if you have them?  We are all here to learn- lay out your case.
@MichaelDent6 @Drew1Lawson @DryGulchMerch @MapleBmaple @seanhannity PS the Will of the People? If you believe that you might want to "Count the Votes"  Because Clearly- the People are for less Power to the Corporations- and keeping Government out of their Bedroom &amp; Vaginas
@MichaelDent6 @Drew1Lawson @DryGulchMerch @MapleBmaple @seanhannity LOL STOP- so Conservatives aren't Bias? LOL-Corporations are a Creation &amp; regulated by the people- Not the other way around- Pro Corporate judges put in place by Corporate powers buying off Politicians isn't how the Constitutional Republic works-
@DailyCaller Gee, Jesse graduated from Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, with a B.A. in History. Ranked #44 of National Liberal Arts Colleges, @Ocasio2018 graduated fourth in her class from Boston University's College of Arts and Sciences in Economics- Just saying
@dStroemsborg @Drew1Lawson @DryGulchMerch @MapleBmaple @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump Well you do have a point there huh?  But don't worry- we can be sure when his accountant goes before the Grand Jury without an attorney- Mueller will track it al down- https://t.co/ZyOL4oJ9MU
@Drew1Lawson @DryGulchMerch @MapleBmaple @seanhannity Really? Facts say, Immigrants-documented or not bring BILLIONS in tax revenue- I guess you didn't know that and commit less crime than the folks born here. So what's not good about individuals that commit less crime and bring Billions to our economy?   https://t.co/hfpZGOxwl2
@seanhannity That's Funny- you calling people "illegal" since you are working with felons-money launderers-and liars LOl-  You mean in a land that was built on Slavery and Genocide?  Facts Matter- So let's find a way to make All People welcome here so they can Work &amp; PAY TAXES
