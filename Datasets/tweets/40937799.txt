Well, I've been on the wagon for 22 years so I missed all the alcoholic fads of the past 2 decades but I just saw a guy in 7-11 get a six-pack of something called "Bud Light Orange." Seriously? Flavored beer? What else have they come up with--blueberry bourbon, strawberry scotch?
Not for nothing do they call 7-11 a convenience store. Grace sent me there in the middle of the Mets game and when I got back they were still losing by the same score.
