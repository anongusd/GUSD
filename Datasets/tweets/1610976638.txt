@SenatorCollins: It'd be “constitutionally dubious, and for him to repurpose large amounts of funding that have been designated by Congress for other purposes is very problematic. I’m opposed to it.”
“Barring truly existential circumstances, it sets a precedent which I think in the future could lead to further executive action that raises significant constitutional questions,” @marcorubio said. 		He wouldn't speculate what his stance would be on a joint resolution.

Time has run-out but numbers still shifting around a bit. No official count yet.
Nearing final tally, 5 Republicans voting NO and 1 Democrat voting YES.
Make that 4....
About 3 mins left in vote, now 3 Republicans have voted NO.
With roughly 6 mins left in vote, everyone has voted along party lines except for ONE REPUBLICAN. It's unclear who that is, as they're voting by electronic devices.
Here we go... House voting on revised short-term spending bill that now includes more than $5.7 billion for Trump's border wall and would fund the government through Feb 8...The Senate passed one last night that did NOT provide money for the wall.
"Maybe if the government shuts down, he can golf more comfortably," @NancyPelosi says of Trump. (Trump is set to travel to Mar-a-Lago tomorrow where he'll spend the Christmas holiday.)

Full story on Bolton suggesting the reason people are so “fascinated” with him listening to the audio tapes of the brutal murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi was because they’re interested in “violence porn.”	https://t.co/PVbByuCp49
Correction: Bolton said "fascinated" rather than "obsessed."
Speaking at WSJ CEO Council, @AmbJohnBolton says he doesn't understand why people are so "obsessed" with whether or not he's listened to the tapes of Jamal Khashoggi's murder.		"I don’t know if it's violence porn or what that they're interested in," Bolton says.

"We're looking for an appropriate response that doesn't completely fracture our relationship" with Saudi Arabia, @senatemajldr says when asked about U.S. response to murder of #JamalKhashoggi. 	"No response is certainly not appropriate. Looking the other way is not appropriate."

Both races will head for a mandated recount required by law. A second, manual recount could occur for the Scott/Nelson race if the first machine recount shows the vote margin is within .25%.
Latest numbers in from #BrowardCounty as the noon deadline has come &amp; gone for all 67 counties to deliver unofficial results to state. 		@ScottforFlorida leading @SenBillNelson by .15 %, roughly 12,500 votes. 		@RonDeSantisFL leading @AndrewGillum by .41 %, roughly 33,600 votes https://t.co/fJpkGJM4pX

Florida gubernatorial candidates @AndrewGillum and @RonDeSantisFL sparred in a war of words Wednesday night during their second and final debate, taking personal jabs at one another over their past actions.	https://t.co/ZglyZ9kT4i
@JJohnsonLaw No, it didn't. 👍 Just wanted to make sure I was clear enough!
@JJohnsonLaw Just to add some context, this is what DeSantis alleged Gillum would allow to happen. Rang out of space.
Also of interesting note to the end of tonight's debate- a fist bump from @AndrewGillum in response to the handshake offered by @RonDeSantisFL.
20 emails from @AndrewGillum during tonight's second and final debate with @RonDeSantisFL, just shy of the 23 the campaign sent during the first debate. https://t.co/97WZyqK7X2
This is a huge, and extremely complex, issue in Florida. More can be learned about it here:	https://t.co/SXrs15B6ad
Restoration of voting rights to felons (w/exceptions): 	@RonDeSantisFL: They should not be automatically restored. Should "earn their way back."	@AndrewGillum: "If you've done your time and paid your debt to society," voting right should be restored.
When asked about speeches @RonDeSantisFL made at David Horowitz events after Horowitz made controversial statements on race: "How the hell am I supposed to know every statement somebody makes?....I am not going to bow down to the alter of political correctness."
.@AndrewGillum: "You're disqualified in my opinion from running for the office of governor."		@RonDeSantisFL brings up Hamilton ticket again.
.@AndrewGillum rebuttal: "If you commit a crime like that, you will be deported from the U.S."
.@RonDeSantisFL saying @AndrewGillum would not hand over illegal immigrants arrested of crimes to @ICEgov. 		DeSantis received some boo's, some cheers from audience.
Final FL gubernatorial debate:	@RonDeSantisFL on ICE policies: "That child molester convicted gets released back on the streets after serving the sentence. And guess what, that child molester will re-offend &amp; someone’s son or daughter in Florida will end up paying the price."

@GeorgiaPashley Hahaha you've got me and @shaynamchugh !

@ThatBazingaGirl Then they must have changed it which is great
@TaylorZeisloft @heather_mcg For a public school to charge that for a select few at an event that isn't supposed to cost anything is.
@TaylorZeisloft @heather_mcg Right, cause we give them to each other rather than ask $200 ,which btw is illegal
@heather_mcg @TaylorZeisloft Plus you get 7 to begin with.
@heather_mcg @TaylorZeisloft You can get extra tickets if you need them.
@TaylorZeisloft How about nobody has to pay for any of it? Like the rest of the schools do.
@hannahbeth1012 they were offering front row seats 2 only a few people 4 a crazy price. And Lakewood doesn't charge anything 4 any seat
Shoutout to #manatee high school for making national news for trying to sell grad seats for $200. #stayclassy👌
