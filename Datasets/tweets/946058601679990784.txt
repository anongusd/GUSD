@AlisonForKY Wonderful!  My heartfelt #Congratulations! to you both.
@pmcall I believe public universities, community colleges, etc should be free to all.  Private colleges should be affordable such that getting an education should never drive someone into tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt.
@pmcall If we take the responsibility of health care coverage off of employers, there will be more money for them to pay better while still making a profit. The money they used to spend on coverage could be used to improve wages. (2/2)
@pmcall First, I think $15 per hour is a good target.  However, I do believe we need an incremental process so that small business owners don't suffer in the process.  I also believe that addressing health care concurrently can help. (1/2)
@pmcall Which other question are you referring to?
Yes @pmcall I am in Healthcare and want to fix the ACA first and then put a solid roadmap in to move forward with a single payer type system.  A lot of good paying jobs would be impacted. @HallCongress https://t.co/oIi7LV0Llw
@pmcall I did an interview with a local activist group, @IndivisibleNKY4, talking about the different paths we could take in the design of such a system, including the different types of systems we could model &amp; including negotiating drug prices to get costs under control.
@pmcall As discussed today &amp; at all of my events, I have both a short-term &amp; long-term plan. Short-term, we need to shore ACA parts that were stripped causing the huge premium spikes we are seeing, while we work on the long-term to design and implement the Medicare 4 All system we want.

@Lord4Congress So true, @Lord4Congress Christina, thank you.
@pattymize Yes!  This is what I was talking about with short and long-term plans.  We need to shore up the ACA to reverse the premiums going through the roof while services get cut in the short term while we plan the design and implementation of the system we want in the long term.
@KYMMJason Agreed!
@RhondaOHair I agree on all fronts.  Further, there are steps we can take immediately to shore up the ACA to prevent the dramatic increases in premiums paired with dramatic cuts in services while we build the type of national system we would like to have.
Skyrocketing health care costs, especially drug prices need to be brought under control. We need short and long-term plans to address these concerns which affect ALL people in one way or another at some point. How do you feel?  What are your thoughts and concerns? (2/2)
