@DonaldJTrumpJr STFU!!!!
@GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan @realDonaldTrump @RepMarkMeadows Your disrespect and disregard is a disgrace.  Your arrogance is appalling.  Karma will have her way with you.  Keep it up, your future great grand children will be ashamed of who you are in present time.  Search your soul and do what is right.
@coleyworld 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂  You can’t make this sh*t up if you tried.  Unreal...we are all living in crazy town.
@senatemajldr STFU Turtle Man!
@DonaldJTrumpJr STFU!
@virginiafoxx Miss Daisy...if your entire life has been turned upside down you wouldn’t try to make money for your family?  Book/TV/News deals would help to feed his family.  Why would that be an issue?

@RepGosar @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle You’re another Jackass!  No one should ever listen to you again.  Just stop it.  You are a liar you politician.  Red face fool.
@CongressmanHice @AOC Stop it!
@GOPoversight @RepMarkMeadows It’s official...You are an AssHole!! 	Your attempt of the “I’m not racist, I have a black friend” was deplorable.  You narcissistic fool, using that woman for your showboating.  Putting her job at risk.
@DonaldJTrumpJr STFU!!!
@MrAndyNgo So they should condone white supremacists’ ideology and activities?  Just in case you forgot, you too are a person of color.  They don’t like you either.  How about recognizing your own self-hatred and denial.  Hate is a cancer that should be stopped by any means. Just Stop!
@rcbregman @The_Corres You are my new 🦸‍♂️...yasssss!
@drboycewatkins1 WTF are you saying...power move?  So what of the black men who marry non-black women?  How about she fell in love with someone who is on her your level.  Someone who has common values, goals, and ambitions.  Her school as nothing to do with that.  Foolish nonsense.
@JeffBezos Don’t let them get away this 💩, stick it to them.  HOWEVER, shame on you for cheating on your family...just because it glitters doesn’t mean it’s gold.

@realDonaldTrump Just stop! 1st It’s Black History Month!  We are human beings, PERIOD!  Stop speaking of us as animals who need rescuing.  We know you don’t give a 💩 about us. This tweet is a get-out-of-jail-free-card for those who voted for a Racist. An exhibit A:”See, he’s not a racist.”Stop!
@PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump STFU!!!
@jps275 @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Who the eff is talking about Dems Or Reps....the comments are about Trump and his racism.  It’s about the man not the party of which he really doesn’t give a sh*t about anyway.  There are racist folks on both sides of the aisle...but everyone is an historian now. STFU!!!
@m96206107 @mitchellvii Out of your minds!!! WTF?...
@DineshDSouza @TheDemocrats Why does any of that concern you?  The Republican Party use to be the party of “family values.” Evidently, that is certainly not the case anymore.  How does any of this personally affect you anyway?  No matter how much you agree with Trump you’ll still be the Indian guy to him.
@BebeRexha Sorry I am not familiar with your work, but congrats on your nomination.  As for the designers, it speaks to their true lack of skills not being able to create a fabulous dress for someone who isn’t a size zero.  Ridiculous in this day and age.  Eff them is right. https://t.co/uE3eaHTd4Y
Where did the sanity go? What is wrong with everyone?  What happened to knowing the “facts.” To the professional News Journalists. Why are you sourcing your reports based on social media.  Find the Facts First.  Stop this!
@Timcast Teenagers away on a trip, they are excited and having fun. They were being verbally attacked by “adult” men. They weren’t being disrespectful considering. I think the elder misread what was happening.  For some folks MAGA=MAWA, which can evoke anger and distain in some (i.e. BLM)
MAGA=MAWA	PERHAPS IF THE NATIVE AMERICANS BUILT A WALL WE ALL WOULDN’T BE HERE.  I think not...when there is a will there is a way.  Stop the madness and get out of the small town, small mind craziness.  There is a whole big world out there.

@FBI Don’t allow this administration to bully this fine organization.  Please insist on transparency and act as the independent institution you are suppose to be.  The White House shouldn’t be allowed to dictate the how, when, and who of an investigation.  This is absurd.
