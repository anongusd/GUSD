7/Republicans need to learn the NRA will not get them elected. Constituents who believe their safety is valued over campaign contributions will get them elected. We beat the NRA in 2018 and now is the time to pass gun reform legislation. #HR8 is a bold first step. Keep going.
6/Today is why we fought like hell to take back Congress. Don't squander our efforts by assuming our Democratic Congressmembers will take care of it. They need to hear from us. They need to know that this issue continues to mean something to voters, volunteers and constituents.
5/This is a first step in what will continue to be a very long journey. CALL YOUR CONGRESSIONAL REPS! Tell them to support #HR8! Make them commit. When more Republican Congressmembers support this bill, it'll send a strong message to their Senate colleagues to do the same.
4/Thank you @lucymcbath,@RepSherrill,@RepBrianMast,@RepBrianFitz, @RepRobinKelly,@RepChrisSmith,@Ann_Kirkpatrick,@RepFredUpton, @JacksonLeeTX18 for co-sponsoring #HR8. We look forward to more of your colleagues on both sides of the aisle joining you in support of this bill.

4/Now is the time to	-Fix NICS	-Protect domestic abuse and stalking victims.	-Stop militarizing police and federally prosecute killer cops.
3/Now is the time to	-Resist Conceal Carry Reciprocity.	-Repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. Let victims' families and survivors sue the gun industry.	-Federally prohibit gun sales to those under a gun violence prevention restraining order.
2/Now is the time to 	-Pass universal background checks.	-Pass mandatory waiting periods. 	-Eliminate restrictions and fully fund the ATF 	-Digitize gun records.	-Repeal the Dickey Amendment.	-Renew the assault weapons ban.
1/Congratulations to the #116thCongress and @SpeakerPelosi! We worked hard to elect Dems who ran on gun reform. We'll work even harder to get you re-elected when you PASS gun reform. Now is the time to pass legislation that has been stalled by a Congress paid off by the NRA.

18/@KatieHill4CA did take the time from her busy schedule to assure us that she‚Äôs committed to gun reform. We want to see those assurances turned into action. We hope Katie's constituents in #CA25 who gave her their time, energy and money hold her to the same standard. #GVP
17/How we fight gun violence will define us as Americans. We need our leaders to not just remember talking points, but embody the moral courage needed to save lives. #CA25 #GVP #ENOUGH
16/Gun reform is more than boilerplate talking points to bury on your website during a general election. We need our leaders to stand up for gun reform in the same way that they stood up for healthcare and same sex marriage as rights. #CA25 #GVP #ENOUGH
15/We won't let candidates use the #GVP community only when it's politically convenient for them and then undermine our work when elected. We've been fighting for gun reform before @KatieHill4CA and we‚Äôll continue on no matter who represents #CA25.
14/If Parkland survivor and @Team_Enough leader @AalayahEastmond who canvassed for @KatieHill4CA with us and @Bradybuzz didn‚Äôt make her tragedy political, Democrats would‚Äôve continued to wave the white flag on #GVP and we wouldn't have the movement that we have today. #CA25 https://t.co/ExhuNGrQOI
13/Gun violence IS political. We can‚Äôt unsee or unknow that the gun lobby gives money predominantly to one party to do nothing about gun reform legislation. Saying that we don‚Äôt want to politicize a tragedy is no better than #ThoughtsAndPrayers. #CA25
12/@KatieHill4CA's quote also gives newly elected MoCs in redder districts permission to not do anything about gun reform legislation. ‚ÄúIf an LA millennial who became a celebrity doesn‚Äôt think gun laws can prevent the tragedy next door to her district, why should we?‚Äù #CA25 https://t.co/SLa3kAC5Bo
11/@KatieHill4CA‚Äôs quote is dangerous because it empowers the NRA to continue its rhetoric that gun legislation is useless because it can't prevent all tragedies. There IS gun legislation that could've prevented the shooting in #ThousandOaks. #CA25 https://t.co/yY8r0OA6Xs
10/@CRPAnews, the CA arm of the NRA sued the state over its ban on high capacity magazines. The ban's injunction has been upheld by a Bush appointed judge in the 9th Circuit. https://t.co/vs1NGaxQiz #CA25
9/CA‚Äôs ban on all high capacity magazines may have also prevented the #ThousandOaks shooting or prevent like shootings. Thanks to the #NRA, it can't be enforced. #CA25	https://t.co/F0iyxgFPIF
8/We're proud to have supported @NancySkinnerCA's bill this year that lowered #GVRO filing fees and added ammo and magazines to the list of items that must be surrendered. #CA25 https://t.co/ULYsrX5fM3
7/We hope @KatieHill4CA uses her platform to spread the word about CA #GVRO, particularly the amazing work of the awareness campaign, @speakforsafety. GVROs could save the lives of #CA25 constituents. It could've saved lives in #ThousandOaks. #SpeakForSafety https://t.co/1FuBmuIDiO
6/The #ThousandOaks shooter was cleared by mental health officials after law enforcement visited his home. Did family who ‚Äúlive in fear of him‚Äù know that a #GVRO was available for them to pursue? Did Ventura County law enforcement? Did local VA? https://t.co/jez8l4gTy1 #CA25
5/CA passed a Gun Violence Restraining Order law after the Isla Vista tragedy in 2014. Since 2016, Ventura County has seized only 4 firearms under this restraining order. Over half of CA‚Äôs counties haven't used #GVRO at all.	https://t.co/HKG0wDW8Tn https://t.co/44bGcSmI2g
4/There's two CA laws that may have prevented the #ThousandOaks shooting: the Gun Violence Restraining Order law and the state's ban of high capacity magazines. Laws only work when we are aware of them and they are enforced. #CA25
3/We want be clear that this order of sentences, however they came to print are uninformed and dangerous. We and so many LA-based activists worked tirelessly these past 2 years to get the #NRA out of #CA25 and that includes NRA talking points. https://t.co/1rDWNwrJHq
2/We do appreciate that @KatieHill4CA took the time to listen to our concerns about the consequences of this quote. We'll allow Katie to better explain how this quote came about. #CA25 https://t.co/bkML9PV7tz
1/Last night we and other local leaders of @MomsDemandAction, @WAGV,@Momtivist, @fialosangeles spoke with @KatieHill4CA about her quote in @NYTimes. We wanted to give Katie the opportunity to explain before we made a public statement. #CA25 	https://t.co/8jgtxLPcGb https://t.co/xwaURH4UiS

Guns don‚Äôt belong at polling places. If you see someone with a firearm on election day, text GUNSDOWN to 91990
In 2016, we saw individuals bringing firearms to the polls. Since then, people have shown up at rallies and protests with guns to intimidate Americans exercising their fundamental rights. If you see an armed individual on Election Day, text GUNSDOWN to 91990
Voters should feel safe and secure when they go to cast their ballot. If you see someone with a firearm at your polling place, find somewhere safe and text GUNSDOWN to 91990
Armed voter suppression has no place in our elections! If you see someone with a firearm trying to intimidate voters at your polling place, text GUNSDOWN to 91990

27/The demands of @LASchools students during the @schoolwalkoutUS:	8-Secondary alert systems installed for active shooter lockdowns.
26/The demands of @LASchools students during the @schoolwalkoutUS:	7-Mandatory ‚ÄúRun, Hide and Fight‚Äù drills. ‚ÄúRun and Hide‚Äù for elementary	schools and ‚ÄúRun, Hide and Fight‚Äù for middle and high schools, which will	empower students in emergency situations.
25/The demands of @LASchools students during the @schoolwalkoutUS:	6-Circumstances for special needs classes, as well as after school	programs, need to be factored into school safety policies.
24/The demands of @LASchools students during the @schoolwalkoutUS:	5-Policies should include classroom doors being locked at all times, as	doors lock from the outside and school yard staff need to have keys to	unlock gates, in the event of a lockdown while on the yard.

17/It's time to hold @LASchools Board accountable to end random searches and adopt a consistent district wide school safety procedure! Do you know who your board member is? Find out here: https://t.co/q5mvkzSmCb
16/It's time to end @LASchools random searches! Tell @CityAttorneyLA:	https://t.co/PiRh66J3B6	Include if your child's school has articulated a clear school safety procedure in the event of an active shooter.
15/@ACLU_SoCal findings about @LASchools random searches:	"Almost all of these weapons were found by other means &amp; were not discovered by the mandatory metal detector searches. Of the total number of weapons found in LAUSD schools, only 6% were found by metal detector searches."
14/@ACLU_SoCal findings about @LASchools random searches:	"LAUSD's mandatory metal detector search policy is not effective at deterring weapons possession on campus; the number of total weapons have increased from 653 incidents in 2013-14 to 783 incidents in 2014-15."
13/@ACLU_SoCal findings about @LASchools random searches:	"Mandatory metal detector searches waste staff time that could be spent on more productive activities to enhance student dignity and campus safety and wastes $1.12 million in staffing costs alone."	https://t.co/zFhj5h20zD
12/@ACLU_SoCal findings about @LASchools random searches:	"Mandatory metal detector searches force students to miss valuable classroom learning time ‚Äî 39,000 instructional hours each year ‚Äî to searches."	https://t.co/zFhj5h20zD
11/@ACLU_SoCal findings about @LASchools random searches:	"Students consistently report feeling alienated, disrespected, and disempowered by the policy, explaining that the policy devalues their education and makes them feel like criminal suspects."	https://t.co/zFhj5h20zD
10/@ACLU_SoCal findings about @LASchools random searches:	School supplies account for 61% of confiscated items, including primarily markers, scissors, white-out, and highlighters. Self-care items account for 10%, including cough drops, asthma inhalers, and hand sanitizer."
9/@ACLU_SoCal findings about @LASchools random searches:	"School staff frequently conduct the searches in a far more intrusive manner than the policy intended, with staff continuing to search belongings even when no weapons or metallic objects are present."
8/@ACLU_SoCal findings about @LASchools random searches:	"LAUSD's "random" mandatory metal detector searches are not random. Instead, students are targeted based on behavior, location, or personal characteristics."
7/@ACLU_SoCal findings about @LASchools random searches:	"Only approximately 0.08% of 105,366 individual student searches conducted in LAUSD in 2013-14 and 2014-15 revealed a weapon of any sort, none of which were guns."
6/For more info about the @ACLU_SoCal fight to end @LASchools ineffective, racially motivated random searches: https://t.co/zFhj5h20zD
5/To make a comment: https://t.co/PiRh66J3B6	More comment ideas:	-LAUSD does not need more time to figure out what we already know: random searches do not lead to safer schools and degrade students!	-LAUSD must completely and immediately end random searches.
4/To make a comment: https://t.co/PiRh66J3B6	-As a student/parent/community member/taxpayer in LA, I demand an end to random searches now.	-Random searches of students are not effective at finding weapons and the school district should prioritize investments in student success.
3/It's time for @LASchools to be a leader in effective school safety that gives students' agency and to end ineffective, racially motivated randomized searches.
2/LAUSD is the 2nd largest school district in the US &amp; it has no consistent, district-wide school safety program. Instead, it depends on randomized searches that targets students of color in low income neighborhoods. ZERO guns have been found during metal detector searches. ZERO!
