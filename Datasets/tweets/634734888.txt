@jdesmondharris left us in this weird place where unless something say "the best," "will make you mad," "people were outraged," or something else that's a really strong and straightforward feeling, people don't care and don't click.
@jdesmondharris And I say this as someone who used to work at Upworthy. Headlines are fascinating to me, like what a difference between using "good," "great," or "the best" can have on click-through-rates.		But I think the over-optimization of headlines and social-media-driven stories have
@jdesmondharris It'd be like, "This girl's reunion with her long-lost relative will fill you with joy." Telling someone what the story will do or *should* do has the effect of causing people to actually feel that (or an approximation of it).
@jdesmondharris I think a lot about the arms race that writing headlines has become. To make people click something, you need to evoke an emotion. An easy way to do that is to just straight-up prime people for what to expect.		Example: early Upworthy headlines did this *a lot*
Because nobody was *actually* upset about *anything*. In fact, the only people who were upset were the people who flooded my mentions telling me to stop being so fragile. It was nuts. Anyway, I wrote about this at the time: https://t.co/JqUehinX2u
A few years ago, I tweeted about a tube of lipstick with an eyeroll-worthy name. Within a week, there were articles about how "the internet" was outraged about it and the company's founder was like "I won't give in to demands to pull the product from shelves!" and I was stunned.
@MatthewBorgard Yeah, I'm not sure what's up with that, tbh!
Anyway, I wrote something about that trend. Should go up on Monday, I think.
And naturally, all the comments were people just flipping tf out (outraged over the non-existent outrage) because they were primed by the article's headline to think these were people who were "outraged," and therefore didn't end up considering that these were all jokes. https://t.co/UDZUdURc3O
Like here's an example. It was a bunch of people making jokes about the bagel emoji. No one was actually outraged. https://t.co/kMvGmUjRmb
@yashar Yashar, no. Wherever this goes... towels, pineapple, elephants... it can't be good
Look at pretty much any article that has "...sparks outrage" in the headline. 60% of the time: like... 2 people on Twitter complaining about something. The other 40%: a bunch of people making jokes about something that ends up getting interpreted as "outrage"

@LizMair Except, you know, it's not. But go on.
@Martina I hear you. That makes sense. It's certainly a thorny issue. In the case of Rachel (the cyclist I think you were referencing in that December tweet?), I just imagine that she felt pretty bummed out to not only get the right-wing dumping on her, but also a legit legend like you.
@Martina (sorry, I'm wrapping up) But basically, as a trans person (I love sports, write about sports a lot, but I'm not an athlete), I do hope that there's a path to a nuanced and respectful conversation (especially if being had in op-ed sections) here. Thanks for listening. (4/4)
@Martina "no." For instance, if someone were to go on puberty blockers in their teens, there'd be no advantage in pretty much any sport. But, if someone is 7'2" and goes on hormones later in life, obviously that presents an advantage in sports like basketball or volleyball. (3/x)
@Martina right-wing groups jump on that. It's a complicated topic. The VeloNews article, I think, provides an interesting perspective. I've written about the issue a lot in the past (https://t.co/JbxT1ewT3J), and I understand it's complicated. I don't think it's as simple as "yes" or(2/x)
@Martina I mean, you and I both know that conservative outlets are quick to pull things out of context. My point being: I think there's a way to have a nuanced discussion on the issue (even coming to the same conclusion you did) without calling trans women "men." Because (1/2)

"Transgenderism is not for the faint of heart"		You're writing dumb hit pieces about trans people, not covering a war zone, guys.

the tl;dr is basically Fox had a segment arguing that it was unfair to have headlines that say things like "Conservatives pounce on [insert mistake by Dem here]," citing it as proof of media bias, I guess?		Except... "[Party] pounces on [whatever]" is frequently used for both.
Over the weekend someone explained to me why a bunch of conservatives are angry about the word "pounced," and man, we really are living in the dumbest timeline.

@chasestrangio @AthleteAlly Does Tucker Carlson cover this topic all the time because he has some legitimate concern about women's sports? No, of course not. He just knows it's an easy way in to a larger argument to delegitimize.

Example: In "left" vs "right" panels, they'll have some sort of Trump lackey (in this example, Jason Miller) representing "the right," and then Kirsten Powers representing "the left."		Powers literally wrote a book called "The Silencing: How the Left is Killing Free Speech" https://t.co/bLqXw1F2uY
@SDscribbler Yeah, I mean, Acosta is just a pain in any politician's ass (which is probably an ok thing!). He once asked Obama why he didn't "knock the crap out of" ISIS (or something to that effect)
@DouggieJones See: Facebook, which basically transformed itself into a right-wing misinformation vessel in 2016 after conservatives whined about a single-sourced article from a conservative who worked at Faceboook who said they wouldn't let him put conspiracy blogs in the trending section
@DouggieJones Oh totally. The right has been playing the refs for decades. No matter how much an outlet capitulates to their demands, conservatives will keep insisting that they're biased in favor of liberals.
@jolomonaco They lean to the right. They overrepresent Republicans on air (think about how many panel discussions are "Here's the pro-Trump conservative, the anti-Trump conservative, and the moderate Democrat"), go to lengths to praise him when possible, etc.
"Oh, but they're critical of him, too!"		Yeah, because he's a corrupt, bumbling oaf with the vocabulary of a 4th grader. The overwhelming of the news involving him *should* be negative. But this, like when they praise him for reading his teleprompter, is pro-conservative bias.
When I say that CNN is a conservative outlet, this is the kind of stuff I'm talking about. They're always reaching to give Trump the most generous interpretation of anything he says possible. And a lot of the time, it takes the form of chyrons that basically just round-up. https://t.co/URnqEXDKGA

This thread is a great look at the grift in action: https://t.co/4bwFk6LYIK
And there are examples for all candidates (or there will be). But the piece is more than 2,200 words as is.
Anyway, that's my latest piece at @mmfa. I hope you'll give it a read/share/etc. https://t.co/Bjl4YFgGSZ
Trump supporters are more likely to give him the benefit of the doubt, refuse to believe bad news about him, and reflexively oppose things said by Trump opponents. "Trump Derangement Syndrome" isn't real, but confirmation bias is.
I also decided to touch on people who yell about "Trump Derangement Syndrome." While it's become a dumb catchphrase, the core has some legitimacy in that people who don't like Trump may reflexively oppose something just because it came from him.		But it works the other way, too. https://t.co/7dDuwrPSG0
In short: confirmation bias.
Now, you may be wondering why people believe smears that *are* obviously untrue. There's some science to that! For instance, Obama being born in Kenya or that he was some sort of secret Muslim? There's a reason some otherwise intelligent people fall for this: https://t.co/aGVg5iSCui
There are plenty of legitimate criticisms that can be leveled against any candidate. The goal in these cases, is to find a superficial narrative that can *then* be tied into legitimate criticisms later on. That's why so many of the attacks right now sound silly: because they are.
Now, to what extent any of those stories resonate with you and to what extent there's truth to them, that's not something for me to really address.		But, the observation here is that the overwhelming majority of those share something in common: they're superficial.
The early narrative around Gillibrand is an attempt to frame her as opportunistic, power-hungry, fake, and morally bankrupt. https://t.co/cQPRoPhjjc
Harris, of course, had the whole fake controversy over whether or not she said she listened to Tupac before his first album came out (she didn't), and then attempts to hit her with a sex scandal-type smear. https://t.co/7M59oLc3eC
In the case of Cory Booker, right-wing media have been floating a couple lines of attack to see if either one will take. One, about him wanting to ban steaks, is just a flat-out lie. The other, about "religious bigotry," is a major stretch. https://t.co/Nv83KtLMa3
Will the "Elizabeth Warren is inauthentic and faking her folksiness" narrative win out? Or, there's another one that's in the early testing phase, centered on policy. The idea with that one is to convince voters that Warren wants them to fail. https://t.co/jfEQaC8h8l
But right now the goal is pretty clearly to just find the effective attack. The stories are presented as scandals/gaffes/etc., but you can tell that the people pushing them aren't really buying what they're writing. It's all just a test.		For instance, E. Warren's first week: https://t.co/iL9Ij9SeCU
In 2016, the most successful narrative centered on Clinton being corrupt/criminal/deceitful/whatever. Whether true, sort of true, or completely made up, everything that was presented as a scandal was fed through that filter. And it worked. https://t.co/Fygjz2rbKa
I wrote about conservative media's early attempts to find smear narratives to use in 2020. Right now, they're throwing them at the wall like a plate of spaghetti to see what sticks, but they'll eventually land on one, refine it, and repeat as needed.	https://t.co/Bjl4YFgGSZ

@AnneLiveTweets okay
@Jane_Hector Nope. Consensual sex work should be decriminalized. And shouldn't be conflated with trafficking.
@Loopthefox @MildlyIrritate1 Bye!
@WintersNFL Thanks for doing that
@JenHoward Maybe the threat of a mass walk-out will cause management to reconsider what they're doing to the credibility. But if they're still there, I just won't trust anything they say unless I see it reported elsewhere as well.
@googlebaum I didn't do... anything? I'm happy with what I tweeted out. I don't gaf if geniuses like you who can't seem to even figure out how to upload a profile picture don't like it. Now get lost.
And honestly, any CNN journalist with a shred of integrity should get out of there. If you think what Sinclair does with its ridiculous "must run" segments and propaganda scripts is wrong, then you should think this is, as well.		Can't trust CNNers still there next month.
@RealDanLee Buh, I'm gonna keep repeating the same dumb false equivalence bu. You dope.		Stephanopoulos wasn't immediately hired into a position of power, wasn't put in charge of coordinating the campaign coverage for his FORMER BOSS. If you can't see why this isn't the same thing, get help.
All news should be viewed with skepticism, but her addition to CNN in that role makes everything put out by the entire network... to borrow from the president, #FakeNews. You can't hire a partisan propagandist to have a management role in your newsroom and retain any credibility.
Yashar's thread explains exactly why I won't trust news I hear from CNN during the 2020 election if Sarah Isgur Flores is working there: there's absolutely no transparency, and there's absolutely no way to know whether or not she's had anything to do with any given story. https://t.co/Jvw3GycrJR
If you're concerned about the human trafficking aspect of this, you should be pissed off about headlines like these. But sure, flip tf out in my mentions instead. That's certainly helpful. https://t.co/yMzPKxF00V
The point was that the headlines read "Robert Kraft arrested for soliciting prostitution." That's not the problem here. JFC, people.
@AnneLiveTweets Then maybe take a breath before you rage-tweet
@MildlyIrritate1 Sorry, I meant mentions
@MildlyIrritate1 Hi, please stop flooding my DMs. I tweeted about it. https://t.co/eci5kkFOxD
Jesus Christ, people, read the next tweet in the thread before you lose your minds.
The human trafficking aspect is definitely worth keeping an eye on to see *if* that's what this actually turns out to be.
I really don't care that Robert Kraft hired a sex worker.
Anyway, the fact that newspapers feel the need to overload op-ed sections with anti-trans views (usually just based on "I don't think this is real, therefore, it's not. No, I'm not a researcher or a trans person. I'm just a person with a keyboard."), has real-life effects.
Heyer's whole thing was "I regretted what I did, therefore nobody should be allowed to do that.		And that's absurd. People regret getting tattoos, but no one's out here trying to ban tattoos on that same basis. Heyer's career centers on cashing on that one story. Over and over.
Like hey, USA Today, you don't need to give Walt Heyer an op-ed so he can write another variation on the ONE story he knows. But you did. And now his quackery is being used to argue in favor of a bill that will treat trans kids as broken and forbid teachers from accepting them.
This is why editors who commission those types of pieces aren't just allowing for a diversity of ideas or whatever ‚Äî but are passively participating in a disinformation campaign that will hurt real people. But hey, gotta get those clicks. üôÑ
If you've ever wondered why crappy op-eds and "reported" pieces in places like The Atlantic, right wing sites like the Federalist, etc., centered on this total straw man argument about trans kids are harmful, check out what South Dakota is doing right now. https://t.co/SfnssVHsGj

@TomT_FL "CNN fired former Ohio Gov. John Kasich last month and there was nowhere near the same blowback. What criticism there was centered around the likelihood that Kasich will challenge Trump in the GOP primary."		You have that backwards. CNN HIRED Kasich.
@crislopezg CNN really hopes that story just goes away, don't they? It's nuts that they haven't actually addressed any of the criticism head-on. And Stelter, the man with access to people who could clear these things up, won't even acknowledge the issues in his reporting.

Also, that plan is clearly just about getting in some digs at Iran, not about the actual issue. Otherwise, obviously, they'd be doing something about Chechnya.
This is very clearly the first he's hearing about this https://t.co/FfGpEhZnsE
But again, that bigot has no room to talk given that he held up the EEOC commissioner's reappointment because he thinks his views (which, again, he's welcome to have, as ridiculous as they may be) should be the law.
Because I really don't care what ridiculous nonsense people like Mike Lee believe. Good for them. But those beliefs shouldn't be *the law*. Asking whether or not you can avoid turning those thoughts *into law* is a legitimate thing to do.
Like, if my religious belief is that eating chocolate chip cookies is an act of evil, asking me whether or not I'd use my position as a judge to outlaw eggs, butter, sugar, and chocolate chips would be a totally legitimate thing to do.
Asking someone whether or not they're going to rule according to their personal religious beliefs and not the law isn't "imposing a religious test," it's asking whether or not they're fit for the job. You need to be able to set that aside and not turn those beliefs into law.
Also hope people are paying attention to the framing conservatives keep using here. They keep saying that asking a judge questions about their positions on things like abortion and LGBTQ rights are "efforts to impose religious tests." They're not.
Hey Mike, remember when you imposed your own religious test on the reappointment of an EEOC commissioner? You said that she had "radical views on marriage" because she [checks notes] believes in marriage as it's defined in the law. But sure, go on.  https://t.co/TxYgEShHSl https://t.co/2Cxztmnvoe
@hokeisit Oh man, do I have good news for you about what happens when people transition at a young age...
@evilangela Exactly. It's so clear that they're just using the sports issue so they can delegitimize us in other ways.
@MaxBoot It's not an insult so as much as it's a description, Max.
The topic can be complicated, and there's a way to have a nuanced conversation about it without declaring things either a.) a total free-for-all, or b.) a total ban from competition.		But few seem interested in having that.
@watcher_war sure, who gives a crap
@cowtung @hokeisit Ever noticed that there aren't trans women dominating women's sports all over the world? It's because there's not some giant advantage that comes with it.
And it's not like @AthleteAlly gave her the boot after what was a very unfortunate and disappointing Twitter battle she had on the topic last year. It was after MN wrote up an op-ed months later doubling down (and expanding) on those views.
@hokeisit Where'd you get your medical degree from?
Its mission statement: "Our mission is to end the rampant homophobia and transphobia in sport and to activate the athletic community to exercise their leadership to champion LGBTQ equality."		Of course someone who wants to ban trans people from sports isn't compatible with that. https://t.co/1Tz3TmStvQ
Glenn Greenwald freaking out because an LGBT sports group doesn't want to be associated with someone who thinks trans people should be banned from competing in sports is extremely on-brand for him.
@chasestrangio @AthleteAlly Greenwald's argument really bothers me. "I was condemning her *expulsion* from an LGBT group as a result of those views."		Like... Glenn, those views are just the polar opposite of AA's mission. Why is it that Greenwald always ends up taking the anti-trans side of things?
@chasestrangio @AthleteAlly It mostly seems like she was upset that Rachel took offense to being called a cheater when she was following the rules. The whole "How dare you call me transphobic?" approach is classic conditional allyship, which is probably not the type of ally AA hopes to rep.
@chasestrangio @AthleteAlly And here's the thing that I'm just... so confused by: there is a non-transphobic way of making this argument. There's a way to have a nuanced discussion on the issue. But neither her December tweet nor her editorial were nuanced.
@chasestrangio @AthleteAlly I don't understand how people think someone can go on misgendering trans people and saying that our existence is cheating... and then think that that person can be involved in a group dedicated to the acceptance of LGBTQ athletes. It's the complete opposite of what the group is.

Is @brianstelter just not *allowed* to cover CNN critically? He's managed to avoid even mentioning the fact that the lawsuit over that conspiracy specifically references the new politics editor
@ltthompso @alexkotch @PaulBlu I'm not the one who went around patting myself on the back concocting an elaborate conspiracy theory involving a congresswoman that fell apart as soon as some else spent 2 seconds looking at the numbers you plugged in.
You would think that @brianstelter, whose beat is (ostensibly) media, would be more interested in digging into the fact that a person tasked with "coordinating coverage" for 2020 was involved with pushing the Seth Rich conspiracy theory to Fox.
@ltthompso @alexkotch @PaulBlu No shit, man.
@brianstelter @madhulikasikka Where's your reporting (you *are* a media reporter, right?) on her involvement in the Seth Rich conspiracy lawsuit? Or her coordination with right-wing outlets to smear news outlets as "fake?" Or her use of a personal e-mail address to seemingly duck FOIA requests?
@brianstelter @madhulikasikka Hey Brian, still curious why you're covering up her involvement in pushing a Seth Rich conspiracy theory? What are you hiding?
It's amazing how he keeps jumping into discussions about trans issues (that don't involve him in any way) just to say the trans people are wrong, usually without even knowing the backstory. I guess that much time spent hanging out on Tucker Carlson's show has that effect.
Startin' to think Glenn Greenwald is kind of a tool
Reminder that when say things like "sex and gender are different' as a way to make some sort of anti-trans argument, it's 99.9% of the time just so they can go, "No, you see, when I dehumanize you, it's because I'm using (my own personal definition of) sex." Screw off. https://t.co/fPTR3QhQbt

@mattmfm @brianstelter @ReliableSources Exactly. This is terrible reporting.
@brianstelter @ReliableSources Brian, why are you ignoring critical questions? Why aren't you pressing @CNNPR on this? When reporting on CNN, is your duty to the audience or to your employer?
@brianstelter @ReliableSources If this was about having a range of views, CNN would have a full-on socialist (not just a democratic socialist, but someone who believes in the full nationalization of entire industries) in a position to coordinate coverage. When is that hire going to be announced?
@brianstelter @ReliableSources You say that this is about having a diversity of views. For one, CNN is already conservative. Beyond that, though, there's no left equivalent of her in that sort of position on staff. You've danced around that point, but it'd sure be nice if you could address it.
@RThe21st @brianstelter @ReliableSources @GStephanopoulos Oh, did he coordinate coverage for his former boss's reelection campaign? 		No, he did not.		Nice try, though.
@brianstelter @ReliableSources What was the hiring process like? What qualifies her for the job? Your reporting is extremely toothless.
@brianstelter @ReliableSources And it certainly seems like CNN sold out its sources by putting someone involved in the hunt for White House leaks in a position of editorial power. Does CNN worry that this will lead potential future sources to take their information to other outlets?

@CommittoVote @brianstelter He should be reporting out everything he finds, but he‚Äôs pretty clearly coordinating with CNN PR on this.

If CNN had any integrity, it'd realize what an unbelievably stupid mistake hiring someone so partisan and unqualified as a politics editor. CNN is already right-leaning. They've made some terrible hires, but this is probably one of the worst.
@conserbud @GStephanopoulos I don't seem to remember him shaping an entire network's coverage for the re-election campaign of his former boss. Nice try.

Conservative media bias in action. She'll fit in with the former people who worked at the Blaze, Daily Caller, or RNC who are now working as straight news reporters they've loaded up on over there üôÑ
And she definitely shouldn't be a politics editor covering the re-election campaign of her former boss, to whom she pledged loyalty.
She has no place in journalism. At all. But right-wingers get special treatment, as always.
And she has a whole bunch of bizarre Benghazi takes. https://t.co/mcKB5B5OwQ
Reminder, she has zero journalism experience. Zero.
Also, that apparently, LGBTQ people are perfectly safe? https://t.co/lkQuA7AxrX
