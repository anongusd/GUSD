It speculated that Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden, and the list is growing. This is not the time for a circus if I want to be President. This next term is going to be hard as hell but I got to vote for the person who best restore our values and morals.
Look at who is entering the field and their experience. Who has the support to get things done. This is about taking back the Oval. The next President is going to have really make America the standard because we been failing at that one.
Let get into this one: The Dems are going to have to narrow this field of candidates quickly. This won’t be the Dems version of 16. The need to vet these candidates and really get the data and see who really can get the job done. Joe Biden got my vote before anyone else.

I ready to go and slap fire into this man's soul. The owner solicited me to come in here and try them out.
The worst part is that I called myself trying to support a small black owned business in Oakland. And now I got a fucked up lined 😡
Black men can attest you know when your haircut is fire.It  uplifts yo soul and recharges you. But this just broke my whole weekend
This n-word pushed my line back and tried to play it off. But I'm seating in the car line something doesn't feel right.
