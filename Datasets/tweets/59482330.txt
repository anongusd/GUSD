.@BethFordLOL: You won’t be a good innovator unless you try many different methods. Example: We’re product testing in farmers markets. #DairyForum

Panel: What advice would you give women to become leaders in dairy?	@Caryfryet #dairyforum
Stroup: You don’t have to be a dairy farmer to become a CEO. We can engage these brilliant new leaders outside of #ag. #dairyforum
.@BethFordLOL: Messaging through social media is how we’re reaching the next generation. How are we seen outside this industry? Its determined on these platforms. #dairyforum
.@Barb4Hmom: I’m a product of 4H. There are places for dairy curriculum to be a part of mentor ship. Let’s put some strategic initiative behind this. #dairyforum
Brown: Women are good at congregating together. Let’s get more opportunities for them to meet. #DairyForum
.@BethFordLOL: We’re showing up where ag and dairy aren’t normally present to demonstrate why this is a great place to build a career. We’re also looking at shaping our job offers to be more open to university students. Not just food science students. #dairyforum
.@Barb4Hmom: @Nasda has a next generation program. I’d recommend more programs and more opportunities for the next generation of leaders. #dairyforum
Stroup: There’s even a situation we think of at @Nestle where a project failed because it was only from the point of a woman. Diversity is a team effectiveness issue. #dairyforum
Stroup: when we talk inclusion of women it’s not a charity thing, it’s an effective team thing. When there is team diversity, research shows team outcomes are more successful. #dairyforum
.@dairy_activist: When I think of inclusion on the DMI board, I don’t think gender, I think age. We need to ensure all age groups are included and focus on the younger generation. #dairyforum @DairyGood
.@BethFordLOL: How do you make sure you include diversity, like in Minnesota, where it’s not as diverse? Our need is to ensure all people are involved in the community. We’re focused on making everyone a part of our community to promote inclusion. #dairyforum
.@BethFordLOL: We’re building diversity into our company. Positions need to have a diverse slate. Pick the best candidate, but make sure you’re looking at a diverse selection. We’ve made huge strides with this outlook. #dairyforum
Brown: Spend time on the things that bring you joy to create balance. It’s as simple as that for me. @AEDairy #dairyforum
.@Barb4Hmom: You shouldn’t feel guilty about work life balance! We have a high priority on work life balance and have lots of flexibility at @nasda. #dairyforum

.@BethFordLOL: I agree. There is a standard of perfection. I course correct and get balance. I make sure I’m there for the priorities for my kids. We are our hardest judges and if I held myself to perfection I’d lose. #dairyforum
Stroup: Work is part of your life. Life is part of your work. They aren’t flipped on and off every day. If you try to push work life balance as a goal, you will always fail. If you love your work and the life you lead outside it, it’s much easier. #dairyforum
.@barb4hmom: Learn how to think strategically. How to deliver strategy and objectives. When I see young people take on project management, I’m impressed. I didn’t have that right away. #DairyForum
.@dairy_activist: Find the person you look up to and pick his or her brain. Don’t worry about riding to the top. Enjoy the journey you take and the people you meet along the way. #dairyforum
.@bethfordlol: Too frequently I see younger people take themselves out of play because they’ve made a mistake or feel not up to it. The joy of the journey is success AND failure. Failure is a learning moment. Build a strong network. Careers are built on relationships. #dairyforum
Brown: Three women have inspired me and we’ve moved through our careers together. @AEDairy #dairyforum

.@dairy_activist: Don’t let the negative things eat you up. #dairyforum
.@barb4hmom: None of us can be successful without the help of people around us. You’ve gone through these situations with people about you. I never thought of things as hurdles. #dairyforum
.@BethFordLOL on career adversity: It’s almost funny. I’ve had a gun pulled on me, I’ve told someone to bring their teeth to work. What I like about this is that it’s the human condition. Adversity is part of life’s journey, and every career. #dairyforum
Stroup: To succeed at @Nestle you have to be mobile. I’ve lived in three continents as a part of this job. A lot of times women may feel like they need to sacrifice themselves for a family. Remember you are all a team. #dairyforum
Brown: I’ve been asked as a company leader if I am a secretary and have faced adversity, like cancer, and these obstacles have made me into a strong leader. #dairyforum @AEDairy

Ostroff: Disruptors that @US_FDA is watching: Cell-cultured meats (claims like “animal-free” or mercury-free salmon?) and the trend of CBD oil food products. Also, we’re engaging in the plant-based foods labeling discussion, which is very, very complicated. #dairyforum
Ostroff: Tracing is a major FDA topic in 2019. Technology has swept way past anything that was envisioned in #FSMA. Think blockchain and edible barcodes. I think it’s time for the food industry to embrace these types of tech and make it affordable to use. 	#dairyforum @US_FDA
Ostroff: On the agenda for 2019? After the shutdown, you can expect activity on:	-FSMA	-Recall-related retail disclosure	-Guidance on listeria prevention 	#dairyforum
Ostroff: @CDCgov has fully transitioned to whole-genome sequencing. This is a significant shift. There is now a database of whole-genome sequencing information from @CDCgov, @usda and @US_FDA. And it’s publicly available. This is the new normal. #dairyforum
Ostroff on effects of the shutdown: Every week the consequences are worse and worse. It’s unfortunate. It’ll cost you money and may affect the kind of talent that will be attracted to working at @US_FDA. #dairyforum
Ostroff: Pleased to have worked with the leadership at @dairyidfa, one of the strongest working relationships I’ve had with an association. It’s a terrific organization. Thank you for opportunities to collaborate with you throughout the years. #dairyforum

Progress has been positive, but we must do more.
Partnerships are priority for us. With laser focus, we’ve also worked with administration leaders to introduce flavored milk choices back in schools.
.@michaeldykesdc: Working together has always been my mantra. We’ve proactively sought opportunities to collaborate with @nmpf on shared #farmbill solutions, as well as @usda, @FeedingAmerica &amp; @MilkLife to deliver 18 million half gallons of milk to food banks for the first time.
@michaeldykesdc: Same old same old is not an option. We’re embracing innovation and disruption at @dairyidfa by changing our governance structure to be better representatives of all things made from a drop of #milk. #dairyforum

.@MichaelJTSteep on the quantum platform: It’s China’s moonshot. It’s got ubiquitous computing power and could, in the future, be accompanied by developing tech called “robotic skin.” #dairyforum
Michael Steep: Culture plays a huge role in how we think about tech. #dairyforum
.@MichaelJTSteep: When I was at Apple, every part of the company was geared toward computers. Steve Jobs came back from the outside and got rid of the word “computer” &amp; said real value was delivering entertainment content on devices. Outside in model. #dairyforum
Outside in model: see what the tech world is doing and get a business leader to monetize it.
.@MichaelJTSteep: Boy is there opportunity, if you can pick the right technology for your business, it can totally change your economic model. In case studies, the CEO or family owner had to go against the internal culture of the company to adopt the tech. 	#dairyforum

We were pleased to also discuss the industry’s desire to compete on a level playing field abroad, which is only made possible through the defense of common food names and the securing of new agreements.
Thank you to Nasim Fussell, @SenateFinance, for the dive into #dairy and cheese trade needs. Today we’ve heard #USMCA likened to “clapping with one hand.” It’s a success for US cheese but can’t be realized until retaliatory tariffs are lifted. https://t.co/b14a9CcVFh

Protip from today’s #trade briefing:	U-S-M-C-A is a lot easier to remember to the tune of “YMCA.”	#usmca @michaeldykesdc https://t.co/pzMbGVQo84
.@michaeldykesdc: We want to see #USMCA approved. In this congress or next? My philosophy is similar to flying. I always take the next plane out because I don’t know what’ll happen to the later one. We do need to move onto new pacts now, with the rest of the world.@hagstromreport
Ahlem: US tariffs on Mexico and China, &amp; resulting retaliations, mean we’re losing business and damaging relationships. China’s already canceled orders. Our customers are wanting to see if we’re reliable, &amp; right now due to tariffs &amp; market uncertainty, they’re concluding no.
Ryan: Details to be ironed out in #USMCA involve enforcement, ensuring those who get quotas in Canada use them (meaning Canadian customers are able to complete trade and receive US #cheese).
Alhem: We need to be attached to the jobs narrative in the US. We’re a part of food/ beverage manufacturing, the biggest manufacturing sector of the US economy. #gotdairyjobs
Sartori: We’re not giving up on asiago in Mexico. We’re still negotiating to keep the common cheese name open for the United States to use. We need to make sure a level playing field is out there for us.
.@michaeldykesdc 95% of the world’s consumers live outside our borders.
Ryan: Ag in trade is essential. Other people in the world do not live where food is made. Us ag food and beverage is the largest manufacturer in the US.
.@michaeldykesdc: I’ve spoken to @USTradeRep Robert Lighthizer. He’s saying they want ag to be an important party of a trade agreement with #EU.
.@michaeldykesdc: $1 million a minute is transacted over the Mexico-US border. Markets do better when we work to remove uncertainty. #cheese
Sartori: All of our cheese products can successfully compete on the global market. 		We are no longer allowed to use #asiago as a common cheese name in Mexico, due to EU efforts to claim the name. We make more asiago in the US than in Italy.
Alhem: We need a proactive, not reactive, trade policy to avoid getting knocked out of markets abroad. The EU is working on/has upwards of 90 trade agreements. We have 20.
Ryan on #USMCA: Need to make sure access is fully achieved. Focus needed on the enforcement of the agreement, making sure market access is effective and not filled by “implied” imports. We’d be staunch proponents of data-based, science-based trade.
Sartori: When we developed a market for asiago cheese in Mexico, 25 percent tariffs and geographical indications were not a part of the plan.
Alhem on #USMCA: 	We’re not yet ready to take a victory lap. We’re still out of the Mexican market until tariffs and retaliations end. After that, we need to get more aggressive about bilaterals across the globe. https://t.co/tu5IZUUWcU
Alhem: The 1,400 people who work for us and 200 farms that supply us rely on #trade. 1/3 of the milk we process goes to export customers.

We discussed the steel/aluminum tariffs &amp; resulting retaliations that hurt US cheese companies, importance of long-term trade solutions in China, need to defend use of common cheese names abroad &amp; desire for a proactive trade policy to pursue pacts in Asia-Pacific region.
US #trade policy must defend the use of common cheese names, like asiago, abroad. Bilaterals in the Asia-Pacific are also the way forward to future success for US cheese.
Thank you, @SenatorCarper, for your dedication to #trade issues &amp; our discussion today. Cheese companies rely on #trade to reach cheese lovers across the globe. The industry needs positive developments on steel/aluminum + retaliatory tariffs in Canada, China, Mexico and more. https://t.co/Ou8F0zOGBZ
Great, deep discussion on #trade, covering positive dairy provisions in #USMCA that can be realized with the removal of steel/aluminum &amp; retaliatory tariffs, need for long-term #trade solutions in China, &amp; importance of defending use common cheese names.

.@michaeldykesdc: Populations are growing in the developing world. The US needs to be proactive in trade to deliver safe and nutritious dairy foods to those who need them.
Ryan on Canada subsidizing its skim milk powder products: Class seven is on track to grow 300% this year. It’s having a direct impact. We can feel it.
Mikhalevsky: We took a small group to #Mexico to talk with their dairy industry. When you all sit together with farmers and companies, you’re able to quickly come to a common position. Getting the two industries together is very important.
Ryan: #Mexico is the single greatest #dairy protein importer in the world.
Mikhalevsky on importance of reliability in dairy exports: We’re dealing with peoples lives. We want to be there to depend upon.
Mikhalevsky: We have an unequal playing field in China. Why isn’t China our largest export market? It’s because we don’t have a free trade agreement with them. #dairy
Ahlem: Even the threat of #NAFTA withdrawal can erase years of American investment in global markets. #dairy
Ahlem: Food and #ag = large source of US manufacturing jobs, &amp; many of the jobs are located in rural &amp; underserved areas in America.
Ryan: People from Vancouver drive into our state, buy our #dairy products and head right back. The price differential is that great.
Mikhalevsky: Dairy exports are so important to the industry now. We can’t live without them.
Ahlem: 95 percent of consumers live outside our borders. #Dairy is uniquely position to provide protein they need.
Ahlem: We need to be looking forward and be proactive with bilateral #trade agreements. #dairy
