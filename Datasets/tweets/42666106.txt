@Rand_Simberg He's not the only witness.  The SDNY also has the chairman of AMI and Trump's own CFO.  They also have Trump on tape directing Cohen to set up a shell corporation to make the payments.

@syjere17 Yes.		That's why it's a federal crime, genius.
I don't think the GOP thought out their new line of "We can't trust anyone who lied about paying Stormy Daniels or claimed Trump didn't seek Russian business deals."
@syjere17 You are you trying to convince? Me, or yourself?
The GOP are calling Cohen a discredited liar in today's hearing because the last time he testified to Congress he falsely claimed Trump had no business deals with Russia during the 2016 campaign.		Trump still claims that.		So aren't they calling Trump a discredited liar too?
Bookmark this tweet for when it's revealed there's a sealed warrant. https://t.co/OG1OJYjSep
It was.	Cohen pleaded guilty and is going to prison for it.	Weisseberg and Pecker both reached immunity agreements.	The prosecutors are preparing more indictments. https://t.co/FmSfPB1tdO
@Advanced_COBOL Reimbursing someone for a campaign expense, which Cohen, Weisselberg and Trump in taped phone calls all say this is, is considered a contribution.		Trump committed two, possibly more, felonies with this check alone.
The most damning part of today's testimony is the $35,000 corporate check.		A $35K corporate check us both an excessive contribution and an unlawful corporate contribution.		Trump would face five years in prison on each charge. https://t.co/0aAXGiDLkM
This is why the "attack Cohen" defense only works on Trump's base.  		Bank records, taped phone calls, and the Trump Organization CFO himself all show Trump knowingly and willfully committed two, probably three, campaign finance felonies, each carrying a five-year prison term. https://t.co/W9qyyXfKvh

Trump won't be impeached, but he will be the first President to leave the White House and face an arrest warrant.  		The Daniels payments are a serious campaign finance crime.  The DOJ just indicted a top Democrat on the same charges for 1/10th the amount Trump concealed. https://t.co/ofXlc7SQQN

@LizMair @redsteeze @bdomenech The minute news broke last January Trump paid Daniels, I laid out in detail how it was a campaign finance crime, and how the investigation and prosecution would play out, down to the specific charges.

Last week: Ha ha ha ha!  What idiot writes a check when committing a crime?		This week: *gulp*
Today Trump defenders will claim illegal campaign contributions are "only punishable by a fine."		That is false.		Illegal and corporate contributions are a DOJ matter and are criminally prosecuted.  		They just sent indicted a Democrat chairman for it.		https://t.co/kljfX9xgzE
@largebill68 No.  Illegal corporate contributions have always been a criminal prosecution.
