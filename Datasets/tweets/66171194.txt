@yashar 3. I‚Äôm never late on purpose, or too selfish to not care that I‚Äôm late. I AM always stressed and angry at myself every single time. I have clocks in every room of my house. I set alarms to leave and still end up taking time to get my things together to leave, so I‚Äôm late anyway.
@yashar 2. I sometimes think 20 minutes have passed when it was actually 2 hours. It is exhausting. And as much as people say they hate it, I hate it infinitely more than they do. It‚Äôs frustrating for me too! Thank you so much for opening up this conversation!
@yashar üôåüèº 1. I was diagnosed at 32. My worst ADHD struggle is time blindness. It makes me a great musician &amp; actor, but has nearly ruined friendships and prof. relationships for me. I‚Äôm accused of being rude/arrogant, but I simply can‚Äôt process how long it will take to get somewhere.

Hi! Remember the romaine lettuce scare of 2018? If it happens again with many items we put on our grocery list, we won‚Äôt know to avoid it because the #govermentshutdown includes FDA food inspections.
Hey there American journalists! Please put more energy and research  into the fact that the majority of the food we are about to buy at the grocery store isn‚Äôt being inspected.
