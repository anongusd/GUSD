Perspective | Trump is ignoring the law to keep the shutdown from causing him political pain https://t.co/XMt2yKU4DI
Payments to the public housing authorities may be stopped or delayed.	Military personnel will remain on the job, but paychecks may be delayed.  	Benefits checks from veterans affairs including disability and pension checks may be delayed.
All non-essential government employees under furlough won't get paid (as many as 800,000 people nationwide), and even essential employees may experience payment delays (more than 2 million people).  	All government contractors do not get paid.
Shutdown will cause federal funding for Section 8 to dry up Nov. 1, Massachusetts housing official says https://t.co/gCRLGQ7u0b

Portuguese  Broa (Portuguese corn bread) eat with jam.. We are big on our james and jelly. teehee.. yummmy..
Don‚Äôt eat poultry for your last meal of the old year to avoid ‚Äúhappiness from flying away‚Äù.	Do eat chocolate to ‚Äúattract riches‚Äù as well as bolo rei, leit√£o, caldo verde and broa (corn bread), or bacalhau as these are traditional for this time of year.
Turn on all the lights, open all the doors, and go outside. Step back inside using your right foot first.	Jump on one leg three times with a glass of champagne in your hand at midnight.	Dancing around a tree promises prosperity.
Some other ways to celebrate a Portuguese New Year:	Take a cold dive in the ocean on the first of January.	Kiss a loved one at the stroke of twelve.	Have money in hand at midnight to bring money throughout the year.	Throw money towards the inside of the house.
Portugal, banging pots and pans together is to ward off evil and negative energy in during the New Year. Fireworks are another tradition found throughout the country to keep evil away &amp; for purification.
My prayers go out to this family. Please repost and help put this monster behind bars.	Houston-area Walmart drive-by killing: Father pleads for help finding gunman https://t.co/bCb3JXIiS7

Safty,t the sheriff should do the right thing. INVESTIGATE. A child who lives to tell you. Tell them I LOVE YOU YOUR SAFE NOW WAIT TO TALK TO THE POLICE. Do not ask anything about the crime. You do not know how to handle it. A child of 5 will believe the perpetrators. https://t.co/pV1rvlolAR
They mocked me and said. "We do not handle cases like this we only handle Murder. Has your child been murdered?!!! We just do not handle cases like this. Later told me " IF YOU PURSUE THIS YOU WILL BE THE ONLY ONE UNHAPPY"
We can prove and insight into a crime. Look and see countless phone calls regarding the family who attacked and victimized my child. The sheriff wanted to convict me! I am NOT THE PROBLEM. I refuse to be walked on. We want Justice @TheJusticeDept

@judithcarmody1 Congratulations. Super excited and can not wait to read. Blessings to you.
I see that sexual harassment is something that is looked at as this HORRIFIC thing. OUTRAGED that someone whos BOOB was touched (Yes that is horrible) Is more of a crime than of a Beaten and Rapped victim Change these laws.
I feel that these BuLLY Families are the only ones that should and deserve to have their children ripped from them and placed in these camps that are set up for our Refugee children, and families Change this around and SAVE OUR CHILDREN from Bully Gangs. @StopBullyingGov
NO one will ever take from you. @StandUp2gather Stand strong I feel Punishment for parents as well of the children who are encouraged to bully,  @ISeeBullying
I was and am a hover mother.
After months of threats to me that these families were going to get me and hurt my Children. I better watch out. I would be sorry. When I wasn't looking. But I always was so this became more of a challenge for them I think. To set this most horrific crime up. @StandUp2gather
I had a family babysit my child the only people I EVER trusted.WARNED them to not let him out of their sight. My child 5 wanted to show they were big now and not to worry. I told the family to watch like a hawk
Sadly very regrettably I trusted them. While I was gone. My 5-year-old Left to show they were BIG now. (We live the length of 3 cars away) My child. "Tried" to come home for juice. @StandUp2gather @STOMPOutBullyng
The children of the parents who threatened us Where waiting for my child  Grabbed, dragged, assaulted, the list goes on. Bully Gang had my child for an hour. (SHERIFF DID NOTHING)
It truly touches the very deepest part of my soul to see that there are groups out in the world that care about a child being bullied. And actually are proactive to let them know that others are there for them. The world isn't this horrible place. Kudos to @52Lives
I was so touched to read about a boy named Tob introduced by 52 lives. I can not help it, but I moved to tears. Very similar situation yet my child was 5 years old. How can I get this type of loving support for my child? Along with a dog, better car for DR. Apt. &amp; a new location.
Up until last year, California had a 10 year limit on rape and sexual assault charges. In 2016, the state passed SB813, which revoked the statute of limitations. The law also ended the time limit on older cases, as long as the statute of limitations has not yet expired.
However, the law does not retroactively remove the statute for cases that have already timed out. The law received a unanimous vote in the California Legislature and was signed by Governor Jerry Brown. It went into effect last year

NO NEXT TIME in CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN by CHILDREN! The law needs to change. Children who commit crimes now a days are more aware &amp; devious than EVER imagined. Parents who encourage their children to harm others need to be ARRESTTED.  Bullies raise Bullies. @ISeeBullying
Hate the fluff in the news.Real times real Crimes in our very own California Captiol:  Sacramento. I am discusted to know this city is our Captiol.The captiol in every state should be a MODEL for the rest of the state to look to for guidance. Especially in Law Enforcment policy.
The children are being placed in MODERN Day Constiratioon Camp commited NO CRIMES. Yet, AMERICAN BORN children are turning into MONSTERS forming CHILDREN GANGS, who not only bully &amp; more hanis crimes, Rape, Kidnape,Brutilly Beat leave for dead. Law looks the other way "NEXT TIME"
This law is only for school this is NOT GOOD enough.. Teachers LOOK the other way when they see a child on the playgrouds getting beat up, teasted.. They do not want to do their job. The sheriff NEXT TIME, Who will really enforce it. IT is a CIVIL MATTER now.

The Truth is Out..Lets fix our children. Some things are comming to the light that have been going on before @realDonaldTrump took office. The growing problems of hate, Bullies, are children ignored, or encoraged to be Hateful. Know this Children Gangs are REAL. Encouraged by..

We need hardcore punishment and infiltration on the families of today. Repetitive habitual behavior demonstrated by a child should be a RED Flag for the schools. Intervention to hope   "Bullies" need to pay time for their crimes.l.
The USA does NOTHING at all to protect our children. While children commit crimes upon others.  I am talking about Children Gangs. Influenced bye their PARENT to do so. They do exist and America needs to wake up. THE POLICE DO NOTHIG BUT brush it off. with NEXT TIME

HUD should be a system that is used to not only help those who truly need it. But,for those just starting &amp; need a helping hand.But, knowing when to let go of the hand that helped them to make way for the next family. Not make those who are struggling pay more. This is just WRONG
NEW Hud rules. Fantastic. I have seen so many people utilizing and abusing the system. It is fast becoming the new welfare. Easy for lazy people to get on it mooch of the system. Making it hard for those who truly need it.
Victims of Violent Crimes need to stand together and get these laws changed. CHILDREN CAN, WILL AND DO COMMIT CRIMES. Gun laws need to be changed. But as well CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN BY CHILDREN NEED TO AS WELL. These crimes are not talked about. Nor are they reported to society.
My family lives in fear daily. My daughter was bullied and tormented. Notes of death threats circulate us. The adults telling me they were going to get my daughter send their children to hurt her and her brother. HOW is this okay.
I have found Law Enforcement will only do their job if they can place a blame on parent for crime to horrific to mention. Say it's "Parental Neglect" investigate to prosecute the mom. If they can't get charge on mother. Crimes are bushed under the carpet.Than investigation Stops
Tragically misguided individuals have children who in turn become a worse. Few can raise above this lack of moral campus.  We can guide our children but we need to be honest with ourselves. Teach our children correct our children.  Lead them on the path to a moral society.
American laws need to be enforced so America stops depravation in our society as a whole. It not just the gun laws. Its ALL laws. Their is NO protection for Any of Us.
