@just_jt9 @lindseyhauschka @HenryAnderson91 No offense to either the Bills or the Jets. But a lot happened on Sunday and I truly missed the injury report on Stephen.. Also, people get hurt in football too. That happens. A lot. I don’t like it, but it happens. If you’re going to try to make a play.. this can happen.
@lindseyhauschka @HenryAnderson91 to make a tackle. Like a real football player. And in real football, people get decleated. It was an honor when folks chose to block me, meant they thought I’d possibly make the play. I hope he heals quickly and is alright soon, I enjoy watching him kick. Cheers.
@lindseyhauschka @HenryAnderson91 We had no idea he was injured when this was recorded. I’m sorry you feel the way you do. I believe Henry didn’t want to injure your husband.

@DunlapSports Back in the day they didn’t have 6’6” 4.3 40 dudes trying to block kicks.. If you aim towards the sideline the chance of an edge guy blocking it is higher.. so, the high normally fair caught end over end kick is just a smarter decision.. blocked kicks are game losers

@jmr2142 There was balls dropped, wild throws, and tackles missed as well
It’s a team game at all times.. if a kicker/punter is having a rough day, it’s the team’s job to lift him up. Just like every other position. The Brand’s done with being the scapegoat. Bad games happen by everybody. Great games too. That’s why football is a beautiful sport
@JCrockett505 It’s easy to pile on is what I meant.. much easier to put blame on one human rather than an entire group, Coach, scheme, etc.
Nebraska punter pins Northwestern at the 1, up 7, minute some left on the clock... Nebraska’s defense let’s Northwestern walk down the field and tie it up.. People love to pile on the kicker and punter because it’s easy.. Punter set the D up for success.. Will be forgotten
