.@GovEvers, stop deflecting. Did you visit your National Guard to see what these brave men and women were doing before secretly deciding to withdraw them? Do you even care to know?
I‚Äôm grateful to my fellow Wisconsin Guard members, and I‚Äôm deeply disappointed you won‚Äôt let them do what they are trained to do for the good of the country. @GovEvers, I hope you‚Äôll reconsider.
.@GovEvers, your guardsmen saved many lives and protected our country on this mission. Did you go visit them on the border to see for yourself? Or did you make your decision based solely on politics?
One such example came midweek when I found a woman alone in the rugged AZ terrain and through our coordination, @CBP was able to rescue her from dying alone in the desert.
On the mountains, we captured a few coyotes, who prey on desperate migrants &amp; charge them hefty sums to guide them to the border. Often times, they desert those migrants if they fear getting caught. Coyotes also commit assaults, rapes, &amp; murders to these vulnerable individuals.
His crew found and directed @cbp to a man crossing the border with 70 lbs of meth. Had we not been there, that deadly drug would be on the streets. Wonder the damage that would do in Milwaukee...
As a member of the WI Guard, I saw firsthand the amazing work by my fellow guardsmen. Stopping illegal immigration is quite an honorable mission, but since @GovEvers doesn‚Äôt agree, let me share a few more things his Guard did this week:
Before returning from my Air Guard mission in Tucson this weekend, I learned @GovEvers is pulling Wisconsin Guard forces out of Arizona effective March 3rd.
We need stronger border security, by increasing resources for surveillance, technology, personnel, &amp; barriers. In Tucson, I worked patrols &amp; saw the dangers we face w/ drug cartels, human traffickers, &amp; more. I‚Äôll return to DC tomorrow w/ this border mission fresh in my mind. https://t.co/myeqEKp2cA
