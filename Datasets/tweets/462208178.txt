@MBEF Respectfully Irl, last I looked #SB564 would mandate a retroactive accounting method for bonus electric rate increases (PISA), a method that has been rejected by the MO PSC because of it's impact on raising electric bills. This bill is about waaaay more than caps.
Thankful for Senators @robschaaf  @DougLibla25 &amp; Romine for literally standing up for ratepayers. #SB564 could raise electric rates by 16-20%.  I don't believe the phony "rate caps". #MOleg
#moleg senators: Stop trying to raise our electric rates by 16-20%.  Don't believe the phony "rate caps"; this legislation was written by monopoly energy companies and will dramatically raise our electric bills. #SB564
Walmart employs 43,000 Missourians. Walmart is opposed to SB 564. #Moleg please do what's right for an employer of your constituents.
@tonymess Ameren customers should wonder why their monopoly electric co so eagerly supports a rate cap. It's because it's not a hard rate cap. They have all kinds of ways around it to rake in more $ from their customers. #moleg
