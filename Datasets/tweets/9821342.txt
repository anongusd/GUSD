Mintcheva: we support not the suppression but the protests in all these cases.	#CAA2019
Shulevitz: not a fan of trigger warnings. First encounter the work. If you privilege a specific aspect of the author's behavior, you skew the reading of the work by pre-framing it. You'll always produce those readings. We need instead more diversity in the syllabus.	#CAA2019
Sneed: we've been so conditioned to go along with tired old roles that are racist and misogynist. We need a radical re-education.	#CAA2019
Shulevitz: Do we remove the works - and censor the realm of the imaginary - of the many egregious and criminal artists throughout history:Muybridge, Carravaggio, Picasso..... long list. I'd say no.	#CAA2019
Mintcheva: we must discuss the problem of power. We need to change the structure of power, not remove individual people. Because removing them does nothing to change the structures of power.	#CAA2019
Shulevitz: (on Chuck Close accusations and fallout): rather than take away the ppl/artworks who bring up interesting important discussions, bring in more opportunities to discuss, more artworks in response. Add more conversation. Not less. 	#CAA2019
Mintcheva: we must give institutions a way to discuss racism, misogyny, etc.		Sneed: but these institutions have no diversity at the top. They lack equity, so how does the institution play the role of interlocutor? 	#CAA2019
Mintcheva: problems we encounter re: censorship have to do w/ institutions. They are under pressure to assert moral values and a type of orthodoxy. I am wary of orthodoxies of all kinds. Are we asking universities and museums to take on the role of the justice system?	#CAA2019
Sneed: Where is the restorative justice? How do we deal with the fact that, for example, women's voices were silenced (cf: thru the behavior of men)? Punishment is one thing. But what constructive ways can we use to get women's voices heard?	#CAA2019
Shulevitz: If we deconstruct the cult of the genius and look at how works of art are made, we can begin to understand the nature of art as collaborative. This is a good, very important byproduct of #MeToo	#CAA2019
Shulevitz: Do we continue to show the Cosby show? Woody Allen movies? TV and movies are collaborative media. Who else do we penalize when we remove their work?	#CAA2019
Judith Shulevitz: on Junot Diaz, though exonerated, continues to be penalized and is still a poster child for the #MeToo movement. There is a failed justice system. Let's fix that, not remove works from circulation.	#CAA2019
Sneed: the participatory arena of judging ppl is troubling.I don't agree w censorship. Where does it stop? Once you take something away - I worry about that. However, there is an intrinsic systemic censorship that happens to black artists that is not discussed.	#CAA2019

Svetlana Mintcheva: What you imagine or know about the author affects how you read the text. Context, the culture at large matters. Art is from cultural tradition, belong to all of us. In removing the work, you penalize not just the author/artist, but also the audience.	#CAA2019
Pamela Sneed (paraphrased): we're talking about violence &amp; racial offfense. As a black woman growing up, I was presented with an array of racist/misogynist classics. There are still no mechanisms for dealing w/ it until it becomes a news item in the system of celebrity.	#CAA2019
How do we separate the artist from the art?		Judith Shulevitz discusses different academic and pragmatic models and cites the novel The Blazing World by Siri Hustvedt.	#CAA2019
