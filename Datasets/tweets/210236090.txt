Meanwhile, the Administration is withdrawing the U.S. from the U.N. Human Rights Council and has once again refused to acknowledge LGBTQ people during this annual Pride Month. In fact, since he took office, Trump has launched more than 75 anti-LGBTQ policy and political attacks.
(THREAD) This week, we have witnessed events in America, the likes of which we thought we would never see. Children being ripped from their families. A President who caused the crisis swooping in to try to fool Americans that he is the one to fix it.
