@DMArtestQB move makes sense
@Charlessigepic1 @WojYahooNBA I don't like Linn but of picks are included I like the deal long-term plus it's a good business move
‚Äú@WojYahooNBA: Houston is finalizing a deal to send Jeremy Lin to the Lakers, league source tells Yahoo Sports.‚Äù Better include a pick
@itsjennyybby most likely 2016 but worth the wait. #Lakers
So now we hope OKC doesn't win and we go for KD in 2016!
@macdyer282 @Charlessigepic1 I like the positive attitude but I am more of a realist lol
@macdyer282 @Charlessigepic1 he will be better then people think but still not a title
@Charlessigepic1 @macdyer282 I love Kobe but he is not getting #6
RT @ArashMarkazi: If Jeremy Lin is the Lakers' big catch this offseason Kobe will be like http://t.co/xpPULpRmvr
@Charlessigepic1 @macdyer282 probably a bunch of role players save the money go for the big fish in 2015 and 2016 we will suck for a few yrs
@Charlessigepic1 @macdyer282 NO!!YOUNG TALENT not old crusty talent
Wade and Melo to Chicago! Lol
@macdyer282 @Charlessigepic1 hell no! Nobody will play with that fool if we want to be desirable again we need young talent that isn't crazy
@Charlessigepic1 @macdyer282 not Lance!
@macdyer282 just get rid of Nash!!
I say Nash for Lin and a 1st round pick @macdyer282
@giladeave alright I'll give you that but we are still zombie free so next time I will answer just in case
@giladeave you called like one time don't act like you call me everyday lol üíÅ
I believe the Lakers have actually crumbled... Has the empire been defeated?
@macdyer282 @Charlessigepic1 rather him then Lin lol but he won't play for us

@macdyer282 Plan B is not title contention it may be 8th seed but not title
@macdyer282 I give up guessing lol
RT @RealGM: Dwyane Wade and Kobe Bryant are now in nearly identical situations.
@macdyer282 probably not that's why I said IF lol LA is best place for Melo but I bet he makes wrong choice
As much as I want Melo in LA the idea of him going to Chi is very interesting if Rose can stay healthy
RT @Lakers_Examiner: According to @JaredZwerling, Carmelo has narrowed it down to Knicks and Bulls.
@macdyer282 the biggest point on Melo I missed in all this is Clev is hard to beat for years he may want to go west
@macdyer282 that's who I predicted would replace DAntoni best fit for us I think
@macdyer282 haha I hope that is true but until I see Kobe play and we get a coach even with Melo I think we are a 6th seed
@macdyer282 I agree but best chance to win is not LA for a few years lol
@macdyer282 the dominos will drop Bosh to Houston Melo will probably stay in NY because of money but I really hope he comes to LA
If I am Cleveland I don't pull the trigger on the Wiggins for Love trade but if they do that's an instant title.
