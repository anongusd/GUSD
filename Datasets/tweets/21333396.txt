@lauracgilleslil I understand what you are saying. My grandmother has passed, my mother is in California - I had to stop with the nanny bc the overtime was too expensive but covered my long hours more than daycare or preschool could. I changed jobs in part bc of it.
@JudithWood5 @continetti @CharlesFLehman @FreeBeacon That's right -- we do the best and of course want the best for our children. I learned from the master, my own mother and dad, who sent me to Northwestern and USC even when they weren't taking any really great vacations or buying expensive cars or houses. True sacrifice.
3/3 And then there's the early investing for potential private college tuition at $50,000 a yr -- what if my 3-year old gets into Princeton or even Pepperdine??? I wouldn't want to deny her that. Must invest early and often.
2/3 It's called career mom guilt. No time to be a soccer mom carting children around to practices. Maybe make a game or two on Saturdays -- so we pay through the nose for the best childcare we can find + preschool -- can't miss out on socialization, esp. if they are only children
1/2 Rising cost of childcare big factor -- but others at play. "The question is whether the rising cost of child care is an independent factor in women's fertility decisions, or a symptom of these other deeper trends." from @CharleFLehman via @freebeacon https://t.co/ZmoIo1QH5F

@pooplebuttmore You really think investigating all of these charges, dating back 36 years allegedly at several different locations and states, that subsequent women are coming forward to raise as concerns, will take 3 days? Highly doubtful.

1/2 I also love how in the #MeToo era, @KFILE spending time on Twitter leading a sourcing inquisition instead of looking into reports this EPA 'whistleblower' had an affair on the campaign trail w/ the @AmericanIdol contestant who sang at Trump rallies, then got her fired https://t.co/byfmb6EJOz

3/3 Notice that no other outlet, even @CNN, has aired a sit-down since and some sit-downs were canceled, because he's not credible, or they would have to ask him abt his credibility questions. This is why @KFILE is trying to kill the messenger https://t.co/6dQZMXEz6p
1/2 that's just what @ABC News did last week when they had a sit-down interview after my story abt his inflated military service on his resume, large pay raises came out.

1/3 Since @KFILE can't let this go 2day, I will say this: The only reason that @KFILE cares abt my story is it's bc it drew blood. This whistleblower has a long list of credibility problems.

In expelling #Russian spies, Trump sr. admin official expressed condolences for the fire victims in the Siberian city of Kemerovo. "You have our deepest sympathies" - we want to distinguish our actions against the Russian govt with our support for the Russian people
From Sate Dept press sec: "The U.S. calls on #Russia to accept responsibility for its actions and to demonstrate to the world that it is capable of living up to its intl. commitments and responsibilities as a member of the UN Security Council to uphold intl peace and security."
Sr. Admin Official on Russian expulsions from U.S.: "Today we stand in solidarity" with the British people. "When you attack our friends you will face serious consequences."
There are roughly 100 #Russian spies in the U.S. -- so U.S. is expelling more than half of the total. Sr. Admin Official: This was a "reckless attempt by the Russian government to murder a British citizen and his daughter."
That would be closing the Russian consulate in Seattle -- Russians are expected to expel our intelligence officers in response. Symbolic but dramatic step.

It's all a fine line, right? At the very least, the service should be providing a voice to dissidents in repressive regimes -- Iran, China, Cuba, North Korea. Under current leadership, it has fired VOA reporters for doing just that. https://t.co/8KGJeOUTMF
@catherineid3 Not exactly that easy because brave Chinese, Iranian and Cuba dissidents desperately need a voice and VOA's mission used to be providing it to them
I just didn't understand your pt. Got it now -- and it's a good one and others have made it, including Rachel Maddow, who I quote in the story making a similar point  - but there needs to be objectivity - both sides and no censorship -- esp. of dissidents of totalitarian regimes. https://t.co/kHhkYPiYJ5
When one of the top Cuban dissidents, Antunez, can't get an interview on the VOA or is told not to use the word dictator during the interview -- how is this productive or real journalism -- censoring dissidents?? Firing VOA reporters for interviewing a Chinese dissident? https://t.co/Uc91MDfPbJ

3/3 The obvious ? remains -- does this group really pose credible security threats? Congress needs to figure out exact reasons behind denials -- If DHS really thinks they are serious, then next ? is how can the U.S. intervene and make sure they can find asylum in another ctry?
2/3 The @StateDept spox is also stressing that the denial of this group is a result of changes to the refugee vetting process instituted in 2016 during the last yr of the Obama admin, and is not because of President Trump's travel ban exec order
1/3 @StateDept spox is emphasizing that no one in the U.S. government is going to force this group of Iranian Christians, other religious minorities back to Iran to face imprisonment, torture and possible death. #Iran #religiousfreedom @VP
