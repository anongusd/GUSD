I will continue to do all I can to hold Wheeler accountable and provide oversight of the Trump administration’s repeated efforts to undermine protections for public health and our planet.
He continues to put our communities and our planet at risk by dismissing scientists, defending polluters, and ignoring scientific evidence on climate change.
Wheeler’s actions as Acting Administrator demonstrate that he is not committed to protecting public health and the environment, and show that he is willing to act counter to the mission of the Agency he is now confirmed to lead.
The Senate’s confirmation of Andrew Wheeler as Administrator of the EPA is deeply disappointing. It is unacceptable that a former coal lobbyist who ignores science was approved to lead the EPA. https://t.co/ZUT2eLRNlK

Oregon’s #shellfish industry and researchers at @OregonState have collaborated on mitigation strategies that are helping the shellfish industry survive. Their research shows what is possible when we invest in science to help coastal communities adapt to climate change.
The economic vitality of coastal states like Oregon depends on the health of our oceans, but #GHG emissions and #ClimateChange are causing ocean chemistry to change. Acidic waters make it difficult for shellfish and marine life to build their shells and skeletal structures.

Protecting public lands reflects our state's best values – environmental protection, stewardship of our land, &amp; community partnership. I will continue to fight to protect our nation’s natural resources so our public lands may be enjoyed and preserved for future generations.
The package includes several provisions from @RonWyden's Oregon Wildlands Act. It would create the Devil’s Staircase Wilderness, and protect the Chetco River, Rogue River, Molalla River, Jenny Creek, Wasson Creek, Franklin Creek, and Elk River.
Today the House passed a broad public lands package with my support. The bill will permanently reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund. #LWCF makes it possible for us all to enjoy the precious outdoor areas that make Oregon so special.
Oregonians know that protecting our #PublicLands, national parks, forests, scenic areas, and wildlife refuges, means protecting the natural beauty and recreation our communities enjoy and the robust habitats fish and wildlife depend on for survival.
After a quiet decision to change leadership at @NOAA yesterday, it appears that Neil Jacobs may have significant conflicts of interest because of his previous work at Panasonic Avionics Corporation. I will work with my colleagues to call on Dr. Jacobs to provide more information.
Additionally this is the longest NOAA has gone without a permanent, confirmed Administrator. There are also significant concerns about conflicts of interest regarding Pres. Trump's nominee, Barry Myers, who led AccuWeather, a private forecasting firm that relies on data from @NWS
The public deserves to know that the @NOAA Administrator is acting in the best interest of improving our scientific understanding of changes in climate &amp; weather and the effects on oceans &amp; coasts, not putting industry interests ahead of the public good. https://t.co/CJTNMYJm1B

I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting the President’s abuse of power.
Building this wall is not a good investment and it will not stop crime or illegal immigration along our southern border. Instead of building walls, we should instead build bridges to those who are fleeing violence and legally seeking asylum in our country.
I support taking action to make sure we have the appropriate personnel, equipment, facilities, and resources to protect our borders from criminal activity like trafficking in drugs or people.
This declaration is an unacceptable abuse of power that circumvents the constitutional authority of Congress.
The President is using this declaration as a false pretense to divert taxpayer money, primarily away from the Department of Defense, toward the construction of a wasteful, ineffective wall along the southern border.
Today I will vote in favor of the resolution to terminate the President’s declaration of a national emergency. No such emergency exists on the U.S.-Mexico border.

We have the opportunity to disrupt a national cycle of discriminatory pay that keeps too many women and families in poverty. We can finally make equal pay for equal work a reality by passing the #PaycheckFairness Act.
Several states, including Oregon, have acted to address pay inequities, but it is time for Congress to address persistent wage discrimination nationwide.
The lack of easily accessible data on wages makes discrimination difficult to detect, let alone prevent. Even when wage discrimination is discovered, working women still face significant barriers to meet the heavy burden of proof for holding employers accountable.
The Equal Pay Act has been law for more than a half century, but in 2019 #EqualPayForEqualWork is not always a reality. Across the country, far too many women are still being paid less than men for doing the same work.
In 1963, Pres. Kennedy signed the #EqualPay Act and our country enshrined into law a fundamental concept: equal pay for equal work, regardless of sex. We have made progress, but unfortunately loopholes and insufficient enforcement have allowed wage discrimination to persist. https://t.co/RT7L87ci02

The most recent increase to the federal minimum wage in 2007 failed to address inflation rates, driving persistent income inequality. Congress must act. The #RaiseTheWage Act is good for workers and good for the economy.
The origins of a tipped minimum wage are deeply intertwined with the history of slavery in the US. Oregon is one of seven states that prohibit employers from paying tipped workers a subminimum wage. The #RaiseTheWage Act will gradually phase it out at the federal level.
The majority of workers earning a minimum wage are women and people of color. The #RaiseTheWage Act will address these persistent wage gaps and allow workers to afford the “bare necessities of life” as intended by the Fair Labor Standards Act.
When workers are paid wages that leave them in poverty, they struggle to pay for rising rent, essentials like food &amp; transportation, and child care. In Washington County, a worker making the local min wage would have to work 73 hrs/wk to afford a one-bedroom apartment.
Someone who works 40 hours per week at the fed minimum wage of $7.25/hr earns only $15,080/yr, putting a family of 2 below the federal poverty level. This is unacceptable. Today @EdLaborCmte is holding a hearing on gradually raising the fed minimum wage to $15. #RaiseTheWage https://t.co/Nq1GQPl3Qj

President Trump owes these families an apology. He could have signed this bill in December. Instead, he needlessly inflicted pain on hundreds of thousands of federal employees and their families.

He says “while I am sure you are voting to reopen the government I am asking you to please do everything you can to make it happen. There are people in a worse position than my family.”
He and his wife sat down this week to look at their bank accounts and make a back-up plan if this shutdown continues. If that happens he will have to get a second job, sell his truck, or take out a loan.
Another #CoastGuard member from Astoria contacted me to share his family’s story. He has a one-year-old and a new baby who will be six weeks old this week. The government has been shut down for more than half her life.
He asked me to please remind my colleagues that “the brave service members of the #CoastGuard do not deserve to be used as a political chess piece.”
He is part of the search &amp; rescue teams, which have been very active this winter saving lives in tough conditions on the Oregon and Washington coast. His job also requires a security clearance, and if he or his colleagues were to default on a loan that clearance could be revoked.
I heard from a constituent who is proud to be from a Coast Guard family- he and his two brothers are all Coasties. He and his wife have some savings but they won’t last long, and he is worried about his older brother, who is a single dad with two daughters.
It is absolutely unacceptable that members of the Coast Guard have to worry about their family finances while working to keep our country safe. 		Several Coast Guard members have shared their #ShutdownStories with me (thread): https://t.co/5e4GGNeUWI
The monthly avg student loan payment is $393. The weekly take-home pay for fed employees who are members of @AFGE is $500. The cost of missing a student loan payment can be high &amp; is not something these hardworking employees should suffer for a political fight they did not choose
I spoke with an employee at a federal prison who is continuing to work under stressful conditions without being paid. She told me that she and her coworkers wonder how they will be able to make payments during the shutdown. Many others share their concerns.
Today I led 70 of my colleagues in calling on @BetsyDeVos to help student loan borrowers who are affected by the #TrumpShutdown.

The American people have been held hostage long enough. It is past time for the President to abandon his ill-conceived border wall, and reopen the federal government before more people are hurt.
With Democrats in the majority, the House has taken swift action to reopen the government. We have passed bipartisan bills to fund government operations and pay workers who have been furloughed.
Members of the Coast Guard, air traffic controllers, and so many others have shared how they are suffering as a direct result of President Trump’s unnecessary government shutdown. This must stop.

Speaker Ryan and House GOP leaders should stop governing by crisis and immediately re-open the government by allowing us to vote on the bipartisan funding plan that was already passed unanimously in the Senate.
This dysfunction shows a total disregard for the families and communities who rely on Congress to keep our nation safe and stable.
There is no excuse for quitting before the job is done, especially when both chambers of Congress and the White House are all controlled by leaders from the same political party. Oregonians and people across the country need certainty and stability.
The decision to postpone a vote to reopen the government guarantees a prolonged shutdown for significant portions of the federal government, leaving families scrambling without the certainty of knowing when their next paycheck will arrive.
It is deeply troubling that GOP Congressional leaders and President Trump have put politics over the safety of our nation and the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of federal employees who are now furloughed through the holidays with no relief in sight. #TrumpShutdown
One of the most basic and important responsibilities of Congress is to keep the government funded.

I will be questioning her directly about this report in hearings next year, and will work to make our schools safe for all students.
Rescinding this guidance would set students of color up for academic failure &amp; perpetuate the school-to-prison pipeline. I call on Sec. DeVos to protect students from discrimination and provide schools with resources to create safe, inclusive, and welcoming learning environments.
The Obama-era school discipline guidance was a critical resource to help schools address racial disparities in school discipline. The Ed Department is charged with promoting equal educational opportunities, and must not roll back civil rights protections for vulnerable students.
According to a recent GAO report, African American students are disciplined at disproportionately high rates and are subject to harsher discipline than their white counterparts.
Further, these recommendations would also reignite a civil rights crisis by again subjecting students of color to disproportionate discipline in schools.
The Commission completely fails to address gun violence in our schools and takes the dangerous step of encouraging schools to arm teachers. This would endanger the lives of students and make our schools less safe.

The oceans play a pivotal role in the global climate system - absorbing and redistributing heat and carbon dioxide. Human-caused carbon emissions harm ocean ecosystems through three processes: warming, acidification, and deoxygenation. #NCA4 #ClimateCrisisCountdown #ActOnClimate
Forests offset approx 11% of U.S. CO2 emissions between 1990-2015, but without intervention that capability will decline. Because of aging forests and increased land use, forests are projected to store less carbon (35% less than 2013 levels by 2037). #NCA4 #ClimateCrisisCountdown
Toxic algal blooms are increasing in intensity and frequency. Rising temperatures, warmer waters, human activities, and increased nutrient runoff accelerate hypoxic events when the ocean’s oxygen drops below healthy levels. #NCA4 #ClimateCrisisCountdown #ActOnClimate

Tune in tomorrow and every day through the end of the year for more findings from the #NCA4 and the #ClimateCrisisCountdown
The effect of humans on the Earth’s climate is unprecedented. Since the start of the industrial era, our dependency on fossil fuels, widespread deforestation, and other carbon-producing activities have caused and continue to cause irreparable damage. #NCA4 #ClimateCrisisCountdown
It is very likely that the Arctic will be nearly free of sea ice in late summer by mid-century. As permafrost continues to thaw, the CO2 and methane released has the potential to amplify human-induced warming. #NCA4 #ClimateCrisisCountdown
Projections show large declines in snowpack in the western U.S. and shifts to more rain rather than snow. #NCA4 #ClimateCrisisCountdown
The sea level is very likely to rise 1 to 4 feet by the end of the century, devastating many coastal communities. The frequency, depth, and extent of tidal flooding are expected to continue to increase in the future with coastal storms. #NCA4 #ClimateCrisisCountdown
Our oceans are warming and becoming more acidic. They have absorbed 93% of the heat from warming caused by human activities since the mid-20th century and are absorbing more than a quarter of the CO2 emitted to the atmosphere annually #NCA4 #ClimateCrisisCountdown
The global average temperature has increased by about 1.8°F from 1901 to 2016. Overwhelming evidence consistently points to human activities, especially greenhouse gas emissions, as the dominant cause. #NCA4 #ClimateCrisisCountdown
CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere are now higher than at any time in the last 3 million years. Climate change will persist for decades to millennia. #NCA4 #ClimateCrisisCountdown
As the top Democrat on the @SciCmteDems Environment Subcommittee, I take my responsibility seriously to #DefendScience and protect our environment. To start the #ClimateCrisisCountdown, I am going to share a few of the most staggering facts from the #NCA4

Freedom of religion was critical to the founding of the U.S. It’s why people of all faiths, and people who choose no faith, speak up to protect it. And it’s why we gather strength by standing together and showing the world that we will not tolerate these acts of violence.

We are now learning that at least 10 people were killed in the horrific synagogue shooting this morning, and several were injured - including four police officers.
The hateful rhetoric we are hearing on a daily basis must end, and Congress must pass and implement policies to reduce gun violence. #EnoughIsEnough
No one should face threats of violence, especially based on their religious beliefs, political preference, or any other personal conviction. The recent acts of anti-Semitism, hate, racism, and bigotry that our country has seen cannot be tolerated.
My heart goes out to everyone affected by today’s horrific shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. This is devastating to the community there, but also to the country.

Secretary DeVos must stop putting the interest of for-profit companies before the interest of students. I call on her to immediately and faithfully implement the Borrower Defense rule and stop collecting on the loans of borrowers seeking relief.
As of May 2018, there were 1,495 Oregonians with pending Borrower Defense claims. Today’s court decision means that those student borrowers who were cheated by predatory colleges will finally get the justice and financial relief they deserve.

I look forward to building on these wins by continuing to advocate for the programs and principles that matter most to my constituents.
We invested in our workforce by providing additional funding for Registered Apprenticeship Grants. Paid, on-the-job training programs will help Oregonians and other Americans find good-paying jobs that meet the demands of local employers.
We boosted funding for Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grants. This will provide schools with flexibility and resources to meet their students' unique needs and help them overcome adversity.
We invested in the health of our communities by increasing funding for the National Institutes of Health. Expanding research and development for better treatments and new cures will save lives and grow the economy.
We added protections for immigrant families by directing @SecAzar to submit a family reunification plan to Congress. We also provided funding for separated children to receive trauma counseling, and introduced provisions to increase transparency/oversight of HHS.
More resources will be dedicated to tackling the opioid crisis, helping our communities heal through prevention, treatment, research to develop non-opioid pain medication, and other important areas. It will also provide additional support for children and families.
In a time of partisan divide, last week’s funding agreement to avert a government shutdown showed that bipartisanship is still possible. Here are a few wins that I helped champion:

Earlier this year, DeVos published a memo claiming that states are preempted from regulating student loan servicers because @usedgov makes sure “borrowers receive exemplary customer service and are protected from substandard practices.” This report makes a mockery of that claim.

In these classrooms, students are excited when they talk about their goals for the future. CTE classes are engaging students and preparing them for success in and after high school — regardless of what path they take.

This bill will help current and future students understand their rights and obligations as borrowers and grant recipients so they can make informed decisions now for the years ahead. It is an important step to protect students and borrowers.
One of the frustrations I’ve heard from former students in Oregon is that they didn’t understand the jumble of terms in their loan agreement or the difference between federal and private student loans.
For many borrowers, student loan debt affects the ability to buy a home, purchase a new car, or afford childcare. They may be unable to access capital to start a small business, or they may put off saving for retirement.

This bipartisan legislation will help respond to the needs of our changing workforce by making it easier for workers to find forgotten accounts and keep track of their retirement savings when they transition to new jobs. https://t.co/6vcyupm6zV
Many workers switch jobs frequently and often lose track of the retirement savings they have worked so hard to earn.
Students attend college with the hope of a better future, not with the expectation of burdensome debt for a worthless education.
The Trump-DeVos changes would support predatory and abusive behavior of unscrupulous for-profit colleges and make it nearly impossible for defrauded borrowers to receive the full relief they are entitled to under current law.
The Trump-DeVos Department of Education is proposing to rewrite the borrower defense rule, which allows deceived students relief from student loan payments.
It is deeply troubling that the Trump Administration continues to side with unscrupulous for-profit schools instead of doing what is best for hardworking students and military veterans who have been defrauded. https://t.co/b0Erv67lEJ

This inequality holding back women and working families back. Women are increasingly the sole or co-breadwinner in 2/3 of families with children. Women's wages pay for rent, groceries, child care, health care, etc.
The gap is even larger for African American, Native, and Latina women.
The #EqualPay Act has been law for 55 years, but still women on average earn less than men for the same work. Women in nearly all occupations and at all education levels experience a wage gap.

No one with the strength and bravery to serve in the U.S. military should be turned away because of who they are. Trump’s ban on transgender troops betrays our core values of freedom and equality, values that courageous transgender soldiers defend with honor and dignity.
Homelessness and a severe shortage of affordable housing affect too many Oregonians and Americans. We must do better. I appreciate the social services and partnerships that @HomeForwardNews uses to serve their residents at places like Pearl Court Apartments. https://t.co/zfXocNeCe6
The President suggested slashing or eliminating many of the programs supported by this funding bill. Congress rejected his proposals and instead listened to the people we represent to pass a long-term funding plan to keep the government open and support working families.
And although this bill makes needed investments in the care and services of our #veterans, it continues to bloat defense spending beyond the actual needs of our military.
I remain deeply concerned that Congress has yet to provide protections for the millions of #Dreamers who are living in fear and uncertainty. #DreamActNow
This bill makes clear that the @CDCgov can study #gunviolence as a #publichealth issue. There is still more work to do to address gun violence, and this critical research can help us identify effective solutions. #DickeyAmendment
#Omnibus boosts investments for @NEAarts @NEHgov, which will improve the quality of life for many Oregonians and Americans.
#Omnibus provides critical funding to battle the opioid crisis, bolster our infrastructure investments, support the mission of the EPA and NOAA, improve earthquake warnings, and support our communities through increased funding for Community Development Block Grants.
After years of devastating #wildfires, this funding bill finally puts an end to the practice of fire-borrowing.
Increases to #PellGrants will help more students afford college.
The two-year extension of #SecureRuralSchools will strengthen public education in rural areas of our state and give more students the opportunity for success.
#omnibus completely rejects @realDonaldTrump and @BetsyDeVosED' misguided education priorities, and instead provides strong support for several programs, including #MoreTitleIV well-rounded education, #CTE, #apprenticeships, and #teacher preparation programs.
Increased support for #childcare programs and @NatlHeadStart will help #workingfamilies access affordable, high-quality child care.
I’m pleased to see robust increases in funding for important programs that will help #workingfamilies get ahead, strengthen #PublicSchools , address #opioidscrisis, grow our economy, and protect the #environment.
Although #omnibus government funding bill is not perfect, it is an example of what can be accomplished when Democrats &amp; Republicans work together. That’s what my constituents in Oregon are asking Congress to do: set aside our differences, find common ground, and get things done.
In Northwest Oregon, we celebrate the mighty Columbia River, the vital Willamette, hundreds of streams, creeks, marshes, &amp; wetlands, and of course the Pacific Ocean. 		On #WorldWaterDay I'm fighting to protect our natural water bodies from climate change and pollution. https://t.co/q2yp9syNdU

Even though Oregon has some of the best laws in the country to address predatory payday lending, online and offshore lenders are using loopholes to get around those laws and exploit vulnerable Oregonians.

.@RealDonaldTrump &amp; Congressional Republican Leadership have said they want to #ProtectDreamers. Now is the time for them to show real leadership and get #DACA protections into law.
Dreamers like Miriam are making our communities better places to live. Turing our backs on them now would be heartless, won’t improve national security, and will have detrimental effects on families and on our economy.
Miriam was brought to the US when she was 9 months old and raised in rural Oregon. She worked hard, graduated from @LinfieldCollege, and now is on staff at @YamhillCCO, helping people access affordable health care. She's a remarkable woman.
My guest for tonight’s #SOTU is Miriam, a Dreamer from McMinnville.

I’m ready, willing, and able to get to work to end #TrumpShutdown, protect #Dreamers, and fully fund #CHIP. Let’s work together to get the job done.
Our country needs certainty, not short stopgap spending measures and manufactured crises like #TrumpShutdown.
Only incompetence could lead to a government shutdown when one party controls the House, the Senate, and the White House.
Which brings us to today. Republicans have had control of Congress and the White House for a year. Republicans created #DACA &amp; #CHIP crisis.
Short-term continuing resolutions hurt our military; just ask #SecDef Mattis. Stopgap funding dangerously deprives men and women in uniform the long-term budget certainty they need to keep themselves &amp; our nation safe.
Four months into the Fiscal Year, Congress has yet to pass a long-term funding plan. They passed continuing resolutions on 12/8 and 12/22.
So why couldn’t Republicans rush through #CHIP or #DACA like they rushed #GOPTaxPlan?
November and December 2017: Instead of working on #CHIP or #DACA, Republican-led Congress rushed through massive tax breaks for wealthy corporations and individuals.
Short recap: @RealDonaldTrump and Congressional Republicans failed to do their jobs, creating the #DACA and #CHIP crises. There is bipartisan support for both.
September 30, 2017: Funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program runs out, but states like Oregon have adjusted state resources to continue coverage for 9 million children, including 140K Oregonians.
In 4 months, Congressional Republicans – who control both chambers – have done nothing to #ProtectDreamers. Most people in the US support protecting Dreamers from deportation.
Trump says he is ending #DACA – even though he supports it – so Congress will take action to put protections in law. https://t.co/1f1wx8FxXQ
Ending #DACA threatens deportation for thousands of people brought to US as children. Dreamers are teachers, doctors, lawyers, soldiers who are making our communities better places to live.
September 5, 2017: @RealDonaldTrump &amp; administration announce they will end #DACA protections for #Dreamers.
January 20, 2017: @RealDonaldTrump becomes President and Republicans hold majorities in House &amp; Senate.
Let’s review how we got to #TrumpShutdown:		(Thread)
I’m staying here in DC, ready to get this done. The American people need the certainty of knowing the government will be open, funded, and functioning.
#TrumpShutdown is completely unnecessary. Republicans should have worked with Democrats to avoid a shutdown, and Trump should have been clear about what he would sign.

Republicans have had control of Congress and the White House for a year, and they are going from crisis to crisis. Our country needs certainty, not waiting until the last moment to fund the government.
@HHSGov It’s wrong and dangerous to roll back protections for women and transgender individuals under the guise of religious liberty.

#GOPTaxPlan hurt universities by imposing a new excise tax on some university endowments.
#GOPTaxPlan hurts students whose employers are helping to finance education by treating employer-paid tuition as taxable income.
Hope Scholarship Credit is a tax credit up to $2500 for higher education expenses ... Gone under #GOPTaxPlan
Lifetime Learning Credit is a $2K tax credit to defray costs of graduate education or improve job skills ... Gone under #GOPTaxPlan
#GOPTaxPlan makes college more expensive for working families by repealing the Lifetime Learning Credit &amp; Hope Scholarship Credit.
#GOPTaxPlan makes it harder to pay off student loans by eliminating the student loan interest deduction.
#GOPTaxPlan makes it harder to pay for college by eliminating deduction for tuition &amp; other education related expenses.
Ways the #GOPTaxPlan hurts higher education:
63% of teachers taking classroom supplies deduction belong to households with total incomes &lt;$100,000 a year, and a quarter earn &lt;$50K.
#GOPTaxPlan ends $250 deduction for teachers who pay for classroom supplies out of their own pockets.
But #GOPTaxPlan doesn’t just hurt students, it hurts teachers who have the most important job of educating our children.
#GOPTaxPlan turns 529 college saving plans into Trump-DeVos private school vouchers that will benefit primarily the wealthy.
#GOPTaxPlan drains funding from general treasury that could be used to improve public education and fully fund bipartisan #EveryStudentSucceedsAct.
#GOPTaxPlan diverts scarce resources from public schools by making changes to deductions for property tax and sales and income tax.
Ways the #GOPTaxPlan hurts public schools:
Syria is joining #ParisAgreement; now US is the only country not in climate pact. Trump's withdrawal was failure of leadership on critical issue.
