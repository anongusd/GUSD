@Jimmy_Durkin here's my unpopular take: that very fact that everyone wants/expects Lynch to get the carry at the 1 yard line demonstrates that a playaction was actually a great call...Carr just threw a bonehead pass instead of throwing it away.
@VicTafur all but 13 of those snaps (Conley) come from from guys who were added in this off-season.
@VicTafur Gruden hates McKenzie's DB draft picks (Obi, Conley, and Joseph).
@PGutierrezESPN here's my unpopular take: that very fact that everyone wants/expects Lynch to get the carry at the 1 yard line demonstrates that a playaction was actually a great call...Carr just threw a bonehead pass instead of throwing it away.
@mattschneidman He’s not a rookie or even a young QB anymore...he’s a 5 year vet...these kind of things shouldn’t happen anymore.
@mattschneidman Well, with Bears on a bye week, our defense had more sacks this week than Khalil Mack.
@mattschneidman Call 9-1-1...Gruden’s bus has run over Carr.
@Jimmy_Durkin ...and yet that’s not actually his worst performance of the season.
@mattschneidman Coverage sack?

@SInow @YourAutumnWind @Rosenberg_Mike they're going to re-name San Diego?
@RaidersAnalysis he did pretty well just to get those 2 yards
@AlbertBreer Will his mom let him take the job though?

@JustBlogBaby No.
RT @GipsySafety: Dear @RAIDERS , 	Thank you so much for a fantastic 2016 season. It's the most fun I've had during an NFL season in a long…
@RapSheet @Jimmy_Durkin sounds like other teams were interested in Downing
@Jerrymcd truth be told, talent-wise, Raiders were probably a 9-7 team...a lot of breaks went our way (except in week 16)
@Jimmy_Durkin @mercnews you sure you don't have that backwards?  Please?
@Jerrymcd yeah, JDR threw him under the bus multiple times during the season
@nickcarson19 @RapSheet @Jimmy_Durkin Coop was mostly injured and a decoy late in the year his rookie season though
@Andy_Benoit agreed...thought Musgrave was vastly improved from last season
@RapSheet @Jimmy_Durkin Musgrave came up with creative ways to move the ball (passing to backs vs. Texans, stake the OL and run vs. Broncos)
@RapSheet @JUhlTrucker Defense improved within the season and was good when it had to be. But lots of room for improvement.
@StillRyanFive @VicTafur @PFF PFF has Amerson as 61st best CB in league...T.J. Carrie at 59th best
@iHarveyKU @RaidersAnalysis yeah...but you gotta admit...you'd rather be us...every one of your wins is ugly
@iHarveyKU @RaidersAnalysis if football was all about Special Teams and defensive scores, Chiefs would be the champs
@iHarveyKU @RaidersAnalysis it took a season-ending injury to our pro-bowl QB for you to be gifted the division
@StillRyanFive I don't think he's a a diva, but reading books doesn't prove he's not one
48% of Connor Cook's 27 incomplete passes hit Texans defenders (13 passes defensed) #oakvshou
@thisisanfield surprising...the tour of Anfield last year highlighted the pride the club took in having an old no frills changing room
RT @BIrvin_WVU11: Want shit done right gotta do it urself! #facts
RT @MarquetteKing: Still no rhythm but heck of a play @tkelce 😂

McGloin is the new Hostetler #RaiderNation
@RaidersAnalysis Trying to stay positive...I'm at least glad McGloin will get 1 regular season start before the playoffs begin #RaiderNation
@JohnMiddlekauff maybe he gets carsick if facing opposite the direction traveled
@JohnMiddlekauff Mariota rode in the back.
@MsAutumnWind great point
@PGutierrezESPN N.G.
@_lfcleanne we have something like 10+ different goal scorers in league play, but Sturridge, surprisingly, is not one of them
@AbePark77 ...wait for it...
@MsAutumnWind and also come away without injuries...
@MsAutumnWind @RAIDERLIVE @Ezilla98 ...Eagles ruined his HOF candidacy!
@MsAutumnWind @RAIDERLIVE @Ezilla98 Asomugha was a pro bowl alternate for Eagles in 2012

@fattylovelove Liar.
@shengwangtime What's "underwear"?
@ChrisHansenNFL Fitzpatrick would have been good enough so that we'd be able to give Carr a redshirt season.
@ESPNStatsInfo @CalFootball so it was the second, not the first.
@cottovic and what exactly ARE you saying?  Do tell.
@cottovic I ask again, why do you hate him so much?
@cottovic why do you hate him so much?
@cottovic Rockets avoided elimination behind Jeremy Lin's 21 points off the bench.
@cottovic make the case that he should be OUT of the NBA.
@fattylovelove that's what I see on the 7 train to/from Flushing, Queens.
@fattylovelove I've made a note of it.

my file at the dentist office has the notation "patient eats popsicles."
accidentally wore two different shoes today.
@zafaressa you have a bum's palate.
@anniechiu no dairy.  Would you do it?
if I left a pot of soup sitting at room temperature overnight...is it OK to eat again, if I heat it up in the pot?
@fattylovelove that's 2 reasons.
looking's free, but touching's going to cost you.
@zafaressa welcome.  don't touch anything.
@fattylovelove you're a 7 year old boy.
the skin is growing back nicely.
@fattylovelove it sounds like 2 meals.

@figgytrees ah, love is a funny thing, isn't it?
@TulliusCicero I hope you at least had a beer with those Cheetos to balance out your breakfast.
the dentist today looked at my teeth and asked me if I snacked alot.
wonders...it's rude to pick your nose in public, everyone knows this.  But what about picking your ear in public?  Anyone?
@anniechiu you should make a "did" list.
@fattylove damn.  Should I wire you bail money again?
@fattylove happy Woman's Day.
@fattylove wait...why?

@TulliusCicero aren't you an early riser only because you have a son who is an early riser?
