@GeneralThoughts so i don't get to go to geneva?
@MattHJensen Yes. But the people at Treasury had to do the algebra to figure that out. Also, there is plenty of algebra in these regs.
But (so far) it is far from clear whether the break is actually having that effect on corporate decision. At the moment, companies seem to be at this phase: How much FDII am I getting? And can my accounting systems calculate it?
Significant concern with FDII tax break: It could give companies incentive to put tangible assets (factories) abroad, not here. That piece is in the statute and today's rules don't really attempt to address that concern, senior Treasury official tells me.		https://t.co/RAKxK0EoB6

@EricColumbus @AndyGrewal @KDbyProxy @BDGesq You should read the hearing transcript from this year that they just had. Was a relatively substantive discussion.
@AndyGrewal @EricColumbus @KDbyProxy @BDGesq If I were such an employee I would probably want written authorization/orders from the TreasSec before I disclosed anything.
@AndyGrewal @EricColumbus @KDbyProxy @BDGesq Right. Some Dems have raised that speculation because they don't and can't know whether and how the IRM is being followed.
@AndyGrewal @EricColumbus @KDbyProxy @BDGesq And on the basic q I think I agree with Andy that an IRS employee could not testify in such a hearing. If a closed hearing, maybe, because it could be seen as TreasSec's means of furnishing requested info.

@economistmom maybe. but also relatively few pass-through business owners adjusted estimated taxes downward for 199A, so that will cut the other way.

@RyanLEllis @pragmatometer @asymmetricinfo @taxfoundation Since their pay-for (so far) is the 39.6% rate, I think the answer is no. That pay-for, of course, would cause a significant regional shift in tax burden.
@asymmetricinfo Fair nuf. Nominal cost of government in a high-cost state is, in part, a reflection of the costs of real estate/wages/etc in those places. But only in part.
@asymmetricinfo Solid point. That said, I find some merit in the argument that the SALT deduction operated as a proxy for regional cost adjustment in the tax code.

One other nugget on cap gains data. Capital gains still have not recovered to 2007 levels -- and that's non-inflation-adjusted data.		Partly the end of the pre-crisis bubble and partly the higher tax rate that now discourages realization of gains.		https://t.co/bMUjOZjj5R
@amoylan @WSJ Sure. but it was up in 2016 and net cap gains dropped. Not a perfect correlation there.
@arappeport These are not numbers that @IRSnews has posted yet, so.....
I'm wide open to other theories/ideas/etc. I think this one generally falls in the "taxes matter but not as much as tax people like to think sometimes" rubric. /end
And last, it's possible that some hedge-fund managers realized some carried-interest income before the new rules took effect for 2018. 4/
For some very high-income taxpayers, TCJA actually RAISED their capital gains taxes, because they can no longer deduct state cap-gains taxes on the federal return. So there was an incentive -- if you moved fast -- to realize gains in 2017 instead of 2018. 3/
But there are some tax plays at work. 		Gains dropped in 16, perhaps because people thought the GOP would cut cap gains taxes. They talked about it in the ACA repeal/replace bills, but it never happened. 2/

@Frel_ @jameshohmann Yes. They are at odds on that but the idea that it is the crowdsourcing of the audit that is a problem is not new.
Trump has had multiple explanations for his refusal, including this one, couched in the idea that you wouldn't want to release while under audit because of how it would affect the audit. (The question is whether public's right to know about the president should overcome that.) https://t.co/YYzw5L9oyc

@californiacpa21 Among the biggest supporters of expanded NOL carryback at the time: Rep. Neal.
But procedurally, what's interesting here is that this is the clearest sign yet that some Trump tax info (not the whole everything) is already in congressional possession. 		Presumably (all caveats here) getting these files doesn't require a request from Neal to Mnuchin.
Worth noting: There can be plenty of ordinary explanations for a $10M refund. Particularly in 2008, companies were reporting losses and carrying those back against prior profits to claim refunds.

@jimtankersley @BruceBartlett No but if % with refund is going to go down and average refund is going to go up, that tells you someone's getting big refunds.
@BruceBartlett @jimtankersley I think the answer to this is actually going to be that high-income business owners didn't factor 199A into their estimated tax payments because they didn't have regs. And then will claim big refunds when they file -- well into summer and October.
@R_Thaler yes, I agree. I'm saying that I'm not sure this policy was designed for political popularity. Also, sending checks when 35ish% got zero or tax hike would be somewhat tricky to reconcile, to say the least.

@UghObWi I guess maybe sorta partly.
Since we're talking about trains today, let's use a train metaphor to think about the cascading effects of the shutdown at the IRS: 		https://t.co/DbRZRxV9KW https://t.co/Td98PaQjH0
@NKaeding @colinwilhelm @LPDonovan Anecdotally, CPAs were telling me no, that they were being very cautious in estimated payments. Somewhat born out by the estimated-tax data we've seen.
@LPDonovan Maybe, and it's message-able, but not sure one wants to own the politics of "average refunds are up but that's just because it's a lot of giant 199A refunds to business owners who didn't reduce estimated taxes during 2018 because no one knew what the rules were."
@RyanLEllis @laurapdavison @SenatorMenendez @BillPascrell I chose the early 90s for a reason -- that's why (in part) Whitman got elected.
@laurapdavison @SenatorMenendez @BillPascrell true. Also probably very similar to poll results from 1991.
.@howard_gleckman says (correctly) we should relax about early tax refund data. Like "forecasting your favorite baseball team’s chances of winning the World Series based on the results of its rain-shortened opening day game."	BUT HOWARD I TOTALLY DO THAT.		https://t.co/OeTq5tLxae
Fascinating point in here from Harvard's Keith Fogg. Even if 1%-2% more taxpayers owe $ instead of get refunds (even if average refunds go up) that creates lots of new work for IRS as it processes installment plans and responses to collections notices.		https://t.co/9Ul54hvf9x

Well, I see that we're having a "stuff that happened at Duke in the late 1990s" news cycle or two this year, reaffirming my decision to never get rid of the stacks of bound @DukeChronicle in my basement.
@michcusejoe5 @RenaeRandall3 @GlennKesslerWP Because corporate shareholding is concentrated at the top. Economists disagree on how much goes to workers of course.
@RenaeRandall3 @GlennKesslerWP Yes. In 2027, if Congress does nothing by then, there is a relatively small net tax increase on most households, compared with prior law. And a pretty big tax hike compared with 2025 law. Which is why Congress won't let that happen.
@RenaeRandall3 @GlennKesslerWP Rates, deductions, child credit, all that goes back after 2025.
@Brian_Riedl Also going to be awkward if all the estimates bear out and, in fact, refunds on average end up higher than last year.
@RenaeRandall3 @GlennKesslerWP The tax cut shrinks over time because of the inflation adjustment, yes. But even by 2025, most middle class households still get tax cuts. 		Tax cuts at the top are temporary too -- but corporate rate cut (which benefits the top the most) is permanent. https://t.co/AVBN4gnpSu
@RenaeRandall3 @GlennKesslerWP The bulk of the tax cuts expire after 2025 and we will spend the next two presidential elections debating exactly what should happen instead of that.
@GlennKesslerWP Looking at the middle 20% of households, 82% of them are getting tax cuts, averaging $1,050. 		https://t.co/nSKngboeXT
Today in Tax Court: This is not going to work. https://t.co/Y2jKVbexaL
@DuaneHere The $1.5T is over 10 years and includes the corporate tax cuts. THough it's more like 150M tax returns.
RT @JimmyVielkind: Cuomo said he will travel to Washington tomorrow for a 2 p.m. meeting with Donald Trump to talk about potential changes…
@stickerdujour That would reduce the % who get refunds and then get pulled out of the average refund stats. These stats aren't perfect, I'll grant you that. But we work with what the IRS provides.
@RyanLEllis Not sure about that -- but yes, you're right though it's limited. Taxpayers going from $1000 to $2000 or higher-income folks newly eligible for CTC should be able to file and get refunds now.
@jimtankersley @RyanLEllis Except that CTC is larger now and goes to more families. The expansion of the refundable portion to $1,400 (check me on that number) thus can't be in any early returns.
@RyanLEllis I think it only means ACTC (refundable) returns.
@MichaelSLinden But won't people notice it less because the change from prior year won't be so dramatic?
@sdemarco89 We don't know the answer to this, actually. @ernietedeschi report suggests the opposite -- with change in refunds being more progressive than the tax cuts themselves. Will take a while to assess for sure.
@TheMezcalJones Yup. Some good @ernietedeschi and Morgan Stanley research here. May even end up with fewer people getting refunds and average refunds being larger. Totally plausible.
@nielslesniewski You've got 199A problems and this is one.
@ArthurDelaneyHP Yup. We used the words "early," "very preliminary" and "unrepresentative" for a reason.  		https://t.co/pTtG5rX8C5
Yes. Another reminder: analysts at research firms expect average refunds to ultimately be LARGER than last year. https://t.co/tkgKaxA6bl
@lenburman There's probably some population that is TCJA-curious and filed earlier than usual because they wanted to know what happened. And some population that is TCJA-scared and waiting longer than usual.
Reminder 2: 		Negative financial surprises in the form of refunds still matter to people, even if they got tax cuts. That's because people use refunds as savings. Yes, I know, they are interest-free loans to the government.
Reminder: 		Most people are getting tax cuts, even if they end up with smaller refunds now because IRS changed withholding tables to dole out some of the tax cuts in 2018.
Apples-to-apples comparisons tough. Filing season started earlier in 2017. No guarantee of same mix of people filing. 		2017 -- First 8.8M returns - avg refund $1866	2017 -- First 20M - avg refund $1994	2018 -- First 17.9M - avg refund $2035	2019 -- First 13.3M - avg refund $1865 https://t.co/ae4iklp9bc
@brendanmdunn @JohnArnoldFndtn I think I did that to you last time but I don't recall an argument that TCJA would lead to entitlement changes. Was more the "we can do tax cuts and still say we care about the deficit because it will cause growth and because entitlement spending is the deficit problem" argument.
@SethHanlon @EOTaxProf @JWellsCFO @lenburman @WilliamGale2 Yes. And maybe nonfilers are in the denominator of tax units. I could look all this up of course but...
@EOTaxProf @JWellsCFO Those TPC tables have some leeway in them where tax changes &lt; x don't show up in the % with cut and % with hike totals. 		cc: @lenburman @WilliamGale2
@JWellsCFO The story mentions that most people get tax cuts.
This is a good question. I have tried to emphasize both refunds (in flux) and the tax cuts (most people got them). 		Refunds, independent of net-net tax bill, are salient to people -- they shape consumer spending and perception of the tax system. https://t.co/pUDjGJc5Le
@Ankfray007 Where?
@NightLight95 @ernietedeschi @ddayen New 20% tax break for many business owners.
@californiacpa21 @WSJ As a blue-state, no, wait, a blue-jurisdiction resident, I hear you.
Another good point. I keep wondering how much of the average tax refund being higher is concentrated in people not claiming any 199A benefit until they file. If a lot, that would seem to have negative implications for wage-earning populations. 	cc: @ernietedeschi @ddayen https://t.co/RVbgmpO5h1
Yes, this could be another reason. Definitely in Virginia, maybe in other places too. https://t.co/haxVlPd5CU
Strong possibility that people went right up to the point of filing, realized they would owe, and decided to wait. Also possible that the shutdown pushed some people back or that people are confused by the new law. https://t.co/6IZvc3RfCB

.@RepBrendanBoyle asks a question that Neal will have to answer when he makes his request. 		Should Congress get Trump's businesses' returns. @stevertax says yes -- necessary to understand what you would want to know.
@pickledcoyote His point is that the core of 6103 says "can't release" and that nothing in this exception in 6103(f) creates an exception to that general rule.
@jtraub2 @Sage_Eastman I was gonna tag Chairman Camp but he seems to have smartly deleted his account.
@AndyGrewal Kies testimony acknowledges that potential argument: 		https://t.co/gEVjM6vMUz
Yin says Congress (in 1924) specifically rejected a proposed requirement that the full House would have to be in closed session to review returns.
@BoCampbell18 Kies argues that this part of 6103(f) doesn't override the general restriction on disclosure.
Kies - in response to a question from @RepDelBene -- says he would not have advised Republicans to do that. Awkward. 	cc: @Sage_Eastman
@SethHanlon @mattyglesias He carefully said that he wouldn't advise a client that they could have comfort in taking such a position. Subtext, though, is what you said.
@mattyglesias Not sure that committing "accidental" felonies is a way to go here...
And I would note that in 2014, House Republicans disclosed taxpayer information to the public when they submitted such a report to the House.
This is what the JCT pamphlet says: https://t.co/tjtOwqhiGl
Ken Kies, former JCT chief and a GOP tax lobbyist, argues that the part of 6103 that allows Ways and Means to provide tax return info in a report to the House doesn't necessarily allow that report to be made public.
George Yin on Neal's authority to get Trump's tax return: “I don’t see any wiggle room in the statute for the secretary to refuse a request.”

And it would be more than a day because they will need to do some redactions and give notice of committee vote.
@AlanMCole @TPCarney You could view some of the others as costs of earning income. But the more generous the standard, the harder a justification that is. Biggest one of course is employer-provided health care, which is off the lines, rather than above or below.
@BDGesq @politico I read that as being about the potential for a leak between when Neal receives and a committee vote, but I see your point.
@AlanMCole I'm curious how this moves as people file and get refunds, which should be larger on average but have enough variance to spur some opposition because people who have lost something or think they lost something tend to be louder.
@SBarlow_ROB yes. I'm not making a point about fairness here -- just noting that if tax-motivated migration happens, the NY tax base can be vulnerable to a relatively small number of people moving.
Michael Desmond gets a 26-2 vote from Senate Finance Committee to be IRS chief counsel. Just Menendez and Whitehouse voting no. To the floor. Again. Eventually.

Some very interesting "☑️the 📦" tax planning from Qualcomm finalized today. 		https://t.co/OGDpzwKRU6 via @WSJ
@AlexParkerDC @InternationlTax @WSJ Not at all clear what is in there.
@InternationlTax @WSJ Can't check box the other way in future?
@RyanLEllis @WSJ yeah. well, it ain't really 12.5 either.
@RyanLEllis @WSJ well, yeah. but that places pressure on residence/inversions if 12.5 is still an option.
@prototoast @WSJ Booked now as a deferred tax asset. Non-recurring.
@AlexParkerDC The BEAT part of this is pretty easy to figure out. The GILTI planning is a bit more opaque. Not sure if FTC allocation is the issue or these are loss CFCs or what.
Corporations have spent decades using "check-the-box" tax elections to book and keep profits offshore.		Now, the same moves -- which don't have to be associated with any jobs or investment moving to US -- bring entities back into the US tax net. 		https://t.co/OGDpzwKRU6 via @WSJ
@RyanLEllis @WSJ Yup. Or selectively branch and have some of your foreign ops at 21 or have deductions against 21 and have other foreign ops live in the GILTI regime. 		The planning itself, directionally, isn't surprising. This is a marker that it's actually now happening.
Big U.S. companies have spent the past year analyzing the new tax law, figuring out how they're affected, waiting for IRS regulations.		We're entering a new phase now where companies are making explicit moves to lower taxes under the new regime.		https://t.co/OGDpzwKRU6 via @WSJ
The new tax law's BEAT tax penalizes companies for making payments to foreign subsidiaries. What's a company to do? Make its foreign subsidiaries part of the U.S. company for tax purposes. 		Voila! Negligible BEAT tax. 	 	https://t.co/OGDpzwKRU6 via @WSJ
New from me: Qualcomm saves $570 million with a check-the-box maneuver that turns some foreign subsidiaries into branches. 		This is one of the first large U.S. companies to disclose specific moves to work around some of the new tax law's rules.		https://t.co/OGDpzwKRU6 via @WSJ

@TheOldOlaf No. Just have to put administrability among the pros and cons.
IRS does valuation now on estates. It is complicated. Cases drag on for years. And this is just once per taxpayer, not every year. Warren wants more money for IRS enforcement along with the new tax.
Potential for avoidance and dispute isn't necessarily a reason by itself to reject a tax plan. But -- and Warren recognizes this -- you have to grapple with it.
@omzidar @jimtankersley @WSJ Yes. And many of those land in years of valuation litigation. And this is a lot more returns.

@nbeaudrot @DLind @BrendanNyhan IRS has to start paying interest on unissued refunds after 45 days (post filing deadline) so that's end of May.
@YellowMatter3 @chrislhayes Right. And this argument is that these activities can continue without that in order to effectuate the permanent appropriation.
@YellowMatter3 @chrislhayes There is a permanent appropriation for the refunds themselves - the cash sent to you. And annual approps for the workers/equipment to do it. *not agreeing with their argument just explaining.
I accidentally typed "Ron Estate" about 4 times before I got the above tweet right. Habits.

One thing that isn't entirely clear from the plan is how many more people are required to work without pay because IRS will issue refunds. 		But, as one hint, last year's filing season shutdown plan had 43.5% of IRS working. This year's plan has 57.4% working.

There should be a newsroom version of the summer-camp thing where whoever touches their nose last has to clear the table. When a press release about pension policy comes in, I want to yell "Not it!" so fast.
@DanielJHemel Outside my realm here, but they do seek annual approps: 	https://t.co/0ZM88aKP68		I think the best version of how I understand the admin argument is: Annual approps are necessary to issue refunds. But in the temporary absence of annual approps, we can go ahead and issue refunds.
@DanielJHemel Isn't the analogy SSA? They also ask Congress for $$$ each year to process payments.

@DanielJHemel That is, you would have to do orderly shutdown of non-life-and-property activities.
@DanielJHemel Tricky question because it's the activities, not the people, that are excepted during a shutdown. So the counter-case would be that they have to take the step to set up the system in a way that would stop refunds, because they aren't required to be paid.

@EOTaxProf @ScottElliotG @peterreillycpa Synthesis: Republicans learned in the run-up to TCJA that the top marginal rate was just one lever of many to achieve their policy goals. Democrats will go through the same process in the run-up to TCJA 2021 or whatever it is.
@Learcomms the latter.
@JStein_WaPo @ScottElliotG I don't. I'm sure it's small -- NYC, NJ, CA.
@JStein_WaPo @ScottElliotG Yes. Though I would again * that the combined federal-state top rate went up on some taxpayers because the SALT cap hit more than the rate cut helped.
@kpomerleau Partly due to Trump. Partly due to UK and other trading partners pushing rates down.
@kpomerleau Another way of thinking about that is that they set other priorities (both distribution and revenue) above top-rate reduction.
@kpomerleau And that was even with a $1.5T cushion!
@RobKovacev Maybe. But I can also imagine Democrats seeking ways to tax the $10M hedge-fund manager without dinging the owner of the 100-employee manufacturer or the regional grocery chain.

@JStein_WaPo @paulkrugman It was a useful exercise. 70 is well above the revenue maximizing cap gains rate so one would want to think about mark to market rules or ending step up in conjunction with that.
@JStein_WaPo @paulkrugman Worth noting that in some cases, the TCJA combo of lower fed rate and no SALT deduction resulted in higher combined marginal rates at the very top.
@UWSPete It seems unlikely to discourage cheating.

@KentDavisCPA @WSJ That is, difficulty of payment isn't the issue. It is a legal determination about what activities can continue without appropriations.
@KentDavisCPA @WSJ Yes they will. But that's because payment processing protects government property, which is an exception to the shutdown.
@nittiaj @jamespmanley Related, my refund story has prompted several "the IRS is not a government agency" arguments in response.
@SamBerger_DC @WSJ Yup. All good questions if and when they go there.
@SamBerger_DC @WSJ See in my piece -- one argument (which they have not made) is that it is implied by the permanent appropriation for refunds. But yes that would be a change in their argument if they go there.
@SamBerger_DC @WSJ Well we shall see. They may not change the reasoning.
@APAndrewTaylor That would be a separate standard. This would be the standard that says exception is implied for people/cost to process permanent appropriations. Tax refunds have a permanent appropriation.
@nittiaj @jamespmanley There are some reasons I am in this line of work.
@jamespmanley I don't give tax advice, generally, but "pay your taxes" might generally be good advice.
Approps lawyers, hit me up.

@JBSDC @dwallbank @peteschroeder This holds true even if the shutdown is resolved and the filing season starts a little later than we might think it would.
@JBSDC @dwallbank @peteschroeder But wait, let's think about this some more. If somehow more refunds go out after March 1 debt limit suspension ends instead of before March 1, then maybe it could move up the X date.
@JBSDC @dwallbank @peteschroeder It would cut the opposite way if IRS collects but doesn't pay refunds.
@DanielAronoff Not that I know of. But I haven't been hyper-focused on that.
@colinwilhelm This is EXTREMELY relatable.
@RandyLPhelps They will.
@LPDonovan Yup. Dems have carefully (mostly) stayed away from "REPEAL!" but they now have to go through the task of figuring out what stays and what goes, both the expiring and non-expiring parts.
@stefanlinge Filing deadline is statutory, as best I know. So I don't think they can.
@LPDonovan Sure. But I don't remember this gambit being played in 2007-12.
Dems aren't taking a GOP proposal here in hour 4 of their new majority, and maybe some would want offsets. And many Dems prefer a Bennet-Brown type CTC. 		And GOP of course wants the "you voted against CTC doubling" talking point.		But maybe the seeds of something are here.
It's not exactly the same, but GOP didn't agree to split top rates from the rest when Bush tax cuts were expiring until the very very last minute. And it fractured the party then.
Noted: Shift in GOP rhetorical position to focus on TCJA pieces popular with Democrats. 		This would split child credit and standard deduction from rates, pass-through deduction, estate tax, SALT cap, etc., which are all set to snap back after 2025. https://t.co/DHVxONKX0d

RT @Brian_Faler: https://t.co/GywX7AHltO
This is a super-premature question/thought but here goes. The government can take actions to protect government property (such as revenue) during a shutdown. 45 days after the filing deadline, IRS starts owing interest on refunds. 		So could they, would they pay them then?
By 2/16/18, the IRS had paid out $101.2 billion in refunds. That's still six weeks away, but people will notice that. 		https://t.co/Mz6lMWaiTR https://t.co/v7Lglm88nr

@davidckamin @DavidMillerTax But that's the thing. It is only a suggestion. Rev proc is answering one set of questions but raising others.
@davidckamin @DavidMillerTax Those had long been assumed to be 162 expenses, right? The rev proc seems to muddy that.
@RyanLEllis Look at the lists of the taxes PTEs can use school credits against in PA and FL.
@RyanLEllis I hear you but I think IRS would just wave the substance-over-form flag. Instead maybe raise excise taxes (gross receipts or real estate or whatever and lower income taxes). Make VA more like FL.
@RyanLEllis How is an excise tax on profits not an income tax?
@DavidMillerTax And you can read that -- though it is not explicit at all -- as saying the CT entity-level tax doesn't work even without a charity component.
@DavidMillerTax Under the rev proc, I think the base of such a tax couldn't be income. If it is, IRS is saying it automatically goes to partner/ S shareholder level.
@LindaCzipo Or in qualified improvement property and multinationals' transition tax overpayments where they assert similar restraint, to companies' frustration.
That is, you can think of the IRS goal here as trying to tightly enforce the $10K for individuals while trying to allow the pre-TCJA status quo for corps and for pass-throughs to the extent the pass-throughs are paying taxes they don't owe as individuals.
Yes. The generous view: 	1. Congress imposed $10k limit on individuals, not corps. 	2. States did workaround.	3. IRS closed workaround but pinched corps in process. 	4. IRS just un-pinched corps.	5. Pass-throughs are messy but aim is to deny workaround for their individual taxes. https://t.co/po94YvAtQg
So we'll leave it to all you Section 162 fans out there to gauge how this fits in with the statute/case law/etc on what counts as a business expense.
One other point. In the summer, we thought businesses trying to do this would have to justify business expense as advertising or something beyond tax reduction (https://t.co/vFJbEsV3dx). 		IRS just says, nah, if you're getting a dollar for dollar credit, it's a business expense.
This is a good thread on what today's late-breaking SALT revenue procedure does and doesn't do.

@Packers128 Those are good questions to which I do not know the answer. And, of course, the number of technical corrections is itself not a perfect measure -- we should really look at impact.
These two things are simultaneously true: 		1. The speed with which Republicans passed the tax law (first public text to enactment in seven weeks) contributed to the need for technical corrections. 		2. Any significant tax law would have required some technical corrections. https://t.co/Ebhh2QwnKN

@yzest5121 Yeah but I was making half-funny jokes long before Trump.
@JoshuaTMcCabe yeah but averaged over 100 years it includes the period where we banned it and thus effectively what you could think of as an infinite tax rate.
@bdquinn Maybe a little slower than I had thought and a lot slower than the president projected.
Data are a good reminder that even though the tax law makes it easier to bring foreign profits home, it isn't automatic that the money will come home. US companies continue to have investment opportunities around the world.
Worth noting too that this measure of repatriations includes both old stockpiled profits and newly generated foreign profits. TCJA made it easier to bring both back.
New BEA numbers on repatriations out this morning. Repatriated money (orange line) is still above foreign reinvestment (blue line) but both are positive, which suggests US companies have slowed the pace of bringing back old profits. https://t.co/MVjHHMsllF

@Richard_Rouco @BretBaier I'll buy that. Taxes prior to 2017? To 12/22/17? To 1/1/19 when the mandate penalty repeal takes effect?

Tax lawyers: If this ACA ruling stands, could people who paid the net investment income tax or the additional Medicare tax file a 1040X and get refunds?
@orlandogotay The judge says a feature of a tax is that it produces revenue.
That is, under this ruling, if a zero tax isn't a tax and that has a cascading legal effect that kills the ACA, how small a tax would it have to be in order for it to be a tax?
@StevenTDennis Because the baseline would now be a no-ACA baseline? 		This raised $314B. Reinstate 1% of that? 10% of that?
@StevenTDennis He cites SCOTUS on features of a tax--money to Treasury, determined with respect to income or familiar factors and producing at least some revenue. $1 per household with AGI &gt; $150k? $10 per household? Not saying this is what Congress should do, but when does a tax become a tax?
@StevenTDennis Alternatively, he distinguishes it from suspensions of Cadillac and med device taxes by saying that suspension/delay isn't the same as setting to zero. So could Congress reinstate it effective 1/1/35 or something?
@StevenTDennis Judge writes a lot about how it's not a tax because it's not raising revenue. The structure of it is still there -- just change the numbers to something non-zero. (I realize getting the votes for that is messy.)
Am I interpreting this ruling right that if Congress set the individual mandate penalty at $1 per household, everything would go back to the way it was yesterday?
@nicholas_bagley Haven't read the whole ruling but PL 111-148 is just the ACA itself. Does this mean the reconciliation sidecar bill would still live?

@SethHanlon That is, when we cut capital gains taxes, we probably shouldn't be surprised if the owners of capital benefit. The benefits to others may happen, of course.

@UWSPete @jbouie yes. Right now, the estimates are a 4:1 or 6:1 ROI for incremental dollars. At some point obviously that starts to diminish. I don't know what that point is.
@UWSPete @jbouie You can't look at total spent, because so much comes in through withholding and and voluntary compliance and with little effort. The IRS budget brings in revenue at the margin -- through taxpayer service, enforcement and collections.
This fine @propublica story on the gradual fade of IRS enforcement is worth your time: 	https://t.co/kf8euE6Kj6
@jbouie Achieving 100% compliance -- or even 90% -- would require very intrusive tax enforcement. 		Most realistic metric to consider is that additional IRS enforcement funding yields $4-$6 for every $1 spent. There's real money there, no doubt.

@kpomerleau @dashching Agree. And it's a timing shift, mostly. Arguably, the revenue effect (unknown) of yesterday's GILTI regs relative to the JCT score of TCJA is significantly larger.

@dashching They thought they were doing immediate expensing for QIP and got 39.
Correct. The following can all be true: 		1. There are, in some cases, incentives for US companies to shift jobs/profits abroad.	2. Those incentives are, generally, smaller than they used to be.	3.

@SaintGimp So yes, this absolutely bolsters the Democrats' case about a rushed law. The concept of territorial taxation got lots of discussion and hearings. These details? From release to law in weeks.
Treasury decides it can't fix this without Congress. So the administration just released rules that let 50% of those expenses to not have that effect. 		Let's call it the Bon Jovi regulation. Companies, I think, can say, "Whoa, we're halfway there." /End		https://t.co/xYO8ERvaO9
And hit in a rough way -- spending money on salaries, research and interest in the US could drive their tax bills up. That is, shall we say, not exactly the policy that Congress thought it was trying to implement. 7/
I'll spare you the details here, but basically, companies in high-tax countries that have nothing to do with Intangible Low-Taxed Income (the ILTI in GILTI) realized they were getting hit by it. 6/
The revenue estimate incorporated this interaction but (for the most part) companies and lawmakers weren't aware of what was about to happen. 5/
Now, it's international corporate tax law, so it's not quite that simple. But it's really not that simple. That 13.125% promise skipped right over the fact that Congress didn't change the rules for how foreign tax credits are calculated. 4/
What's GILTI? It's a minimum tax. The deal -- as it was sold -- was this. Put your profits in a tax haven, you have to pay the US 10.5%. But if you operate in big economies with tax rates over 13.125%, you're home free and you owe the US nothing on that. 3/
Ok. So Congress last year wanted to (basically) eliminate taxes on US companies' foreign income. Cool. But it didn't want to give corps a free pass. So it created GILTI. 2/

@nanc455 Yes. But omnibus has more unrelated sweeteners so now this may have to really get to 60 on its own.
At some level, this increases odds for a tax bill because they don't need a deal by the spending deadline. But they need some bipartisan deal; Senate Dems don't sound eager yet. 		It could get bigger (Christmas tree so everyone's happy), narrower (must-dos) or slide to January.
Brady says year-end tax bill won't be attached to omnibus spending bill. So that means it needs 60 Senate votes and some Senate floor time. A lot of the pieces of the package are bipartisan. But Senate Dems will need some changes.
@HarrySteinDC Dude.
@RyanLEllis @AlexParkerDC @Saunderswsj The TPC 5% estimate seems plausible. This is not the end of charitable giving and my story doesn't suggest it is. But the charities' nervousness is not irrational.

@RyanLEllis @Saunderswsj @AlexParkerDC Absolutely. Taxes matter but taxes aren't everything.
High-income people still get the charitable tax deduction. Low-income people never did. 		Charities that rely on $500, $1,000 at a time from the upper-middle-class are the ones who could get pinched. 		https://t.co/mhsvaiOtBZ via @WSJ

@MichaelSLinden @ernietedeschi @Brian_Faler @bencasselman @greg_ip @jimtankersley @AlexParkerDC Well, I labeled it attempt. 		It's a slightly different way of saying that voters don't see tax cuts as a priority in a time of large budget deficits.
@MichaelSLinden @ernietedeschi @Brian_Faler @bencasselman @greg_ip @jimtankersley @AlexParkerDC Attempt:		You sometimes see arguments for an economic equilibrium of revenue at 18ish% of GDP.		It's really a political effect. People start feeling overtaxed near 20% and elect Congresses to cut taxes.		Flip side: When revenue is at 17%/GDP, political support for tax cuts wanes.
@MichaelSLinden @Brian_Faler @bencasselman @ernietedeschi @greg_ip @jimtankersley @AlexParkerDC Possible. But it was a lot of NY-to-DC-based Republicans who lost. 		That said, I see it as one reason among several.
@MichaelSLinden @jimtankersley @bencasselman @ernietedeschi @greg_ip @AlexParkerDC Because the NJ property tax bill is bigger as a share of home value (compared to, say, here), it's exponentially more salient.
@MichaelSLinden @jimtankersley @bencasselman @ernietedeschi @greg_ip @AlexParkerDC Yes. And, somewhat separately, every NJ homeowner knows exactly how big their annual property tax bill is. So just the publicity around the number being $10,000 -- even if there are rate cuts and whatever else -- means that you know that can't cover your $12k or $15k or whatever.
@MichaelSLinden @jimtankersley @bencasselman @ernietedeschi @greg_ip @AlexParkerDC Notwithstanding the fact that if you make enough money to be hit by a SALT cap-induced tax increase that you are also likely wealthy enough to be a corporate shareholder.
@jimtankersley @MichaelSLinden @bencasselman @ernietedeschi @greg_ip @AlexParkerDC Need to make a new version of that one that capitalizes House.
@MichaelSLinden @bencasselman @ernietedeschi @greg_ip @jimtankersley @AlexParkerDC That is, the message that the SALT cap was a GOP strategy that penalized blue states was coming, in part, from blue-state Republicans.
@MichaelSLinden @bencasselman @ernietedeschi @greg_ip @jimtankersley @AlexParkerDC Also, the comments by MacArthur/Walters/Roskam/Paulsen during the TCJA process -- along with the no votes from Donovan/Faso/Lance etc -- told their voters that SALT mattered to them.
@MichaelSLinden @bencasselman @ernietedeschi @greg_ip @jimtankersley @AlexParkerDC Yes, but in those core House districts in NJ/NY/CA/IL/MN, the SALT message was sprinkled in there.
Another SALT cap thought. Not a perfect parallel, but it reminds me of ACA Medicare cuts. It achieves a minority-party policy aim (entitlement cut/raising taxes on rich) inside majority's signature achievement. Proves useful to minority in campaign. And difficult to reverse.
@robdamschen The question has never come up in my reporting.

@EOTaxProf @kirkstark Most interesting to me is the release of the audit, which recent presidents have not done.
@ByronTau Some days/weeks, there is actually more direct debate between senators on Twitter than on the Senate floor.
@hillhulse And despite all that, the state with the biggest % of households with tax hikes is NJ with a whopping..... 10%. The vast majority are getting tax cuts this year. Even in blue states. Really.
@CamperWatcher27 I wouldn't use your exact language, but yes.
Coda: I went back and read my SALT story from April 2017. Set the merits of the policy aside and say what you will about Peter King, but his warning to GOP leaders and the New Yorkers running administration tax policy couldn't have been clearer: 		https://t.co/e1RAf0nqti
If current voter trends continue, the next GOP-controlled House wouldn't seem to have much of a stronghold at all in those places and SALT becomes hardened as a much more partisan issue than it was in 86. /end
And others who could have cited SALT as a reason to vote no (MacArthur, Paulsen, Roskam, Walters, Comstock) found enough other stuff in TCJA to like. 3/
In 1986, New York Republicans had enough clout to stop repeal. But by 2017, there were no votes, but just not enough of them. The $10k cap was fine for most upstate members. 2/
The SALT cap happened right at the inflection point where there were enough suburban Republicans to give the party a House majority and not enough from high-income, high-tax places to stop the cap. 1/
@jimtankersley And even the April 2019 reconciling of all of this won't help. Many people will compare refund size to refund size, not total tax bill from year to year or total tax bill against a non-TCJA baseline.
@jimtankersley As @RyanLEllis says of his party: “They let the Democrats get away all year with telling people who just got their taxes cut that they got a tax increase."		https://t.co/D5keUVLVkq

@RyanLEllis So it wasn't really a $1.5T tax cut...
I realize that that's a somewhat cynical take about how Washington works. But I saw "R&amp;D Credit Extender: The Sequel's Sequel's Sequel" so there's that.
So you can look at this report and say, "Aha! CBO says TCJA does bad things to R&amp;D investment, which we all think is good!"		But what will also happen is it will become ammunition for businesses to make sure that R&amp;D amortization never happens and disappear a $120B payfor.
And why does the tax rate on R&amp;D investments go up? It's because the tax law has a not-oft-discussed tax increase that kicks in starting in 2022 - requires research costs to be amortized over 5 years instead of deducted.
OK, so a lot of the report is about pre-2018 law and it helpfully separates out different types of intangible assets and different ways to think about the the tax rate (including the failure rate of risky projects, important for pharma).

@petersternfeld So that cap is explicitly not indexed to inflation. To change it before it expires on 1/1/26, Congress would have to pass a law. 		That's more possible now that Dems will have the House, but still hard to see. And messy because raising the cap loses revenue and is regressive.

2. For 2019, the dividing point between the 24% and 32% brackets is $321,450 for married couples. 		But the phase-out of the pass-through deduction starts at $321,400. 		This has minimal consequences for people's tax returns, but it's just weird. 		Why does this happen?
1. A wild IRS inflation-adjustment oddity:		This year, the dividing point between the 24% and 32% brackets is $315k. That's also where the new pass-through deduction starts phasing out. 		So we assume that those two just increase in tandem? 		Wrong. 		https://t.co/0qyZanYm0l

@TimFernholz @morningmoneyben For instance -- and this is not even about SALT -- I'm currently arguing with a reader who is insisting that most people making $400k aren't getting tax cuts. (They are.)
@TimFernholz @morningmoneyben That's actually a reason why it might have more effect now. 		The number of people who think they are getting tax increases &gt; the number of people actually getting tax increases. 		(I think it was a factor but not the primary or sole factor, fwiw.)

@codyevans For sure. This isn't contrary to the intent of the policy (set aside whether projects in designated OZs actually benefit LICs or LIC residents). 		My point is that I had been thinking of "gains" as "pent-up long-term gains that would never get realized" but it's not just that.

@UghObWi @kpomerleau @JoshuaTMcCabe The pledge is part-cause of the GOP tax orthodoxy. But only part. It's a manifestation of what the party found for years to be a winning argument.
@kpomerleau @JoshuaTMcCabe If baked inside a bunch of other changes, maybe. maybe.
@JoshuaTMcCabe This would require Republicans supporting a rate increase. That strikes me as counter to a core party position since 1990. Big philosophical leap.
@stevertax @WSJ And if I understand it right, the hedge fund investor can wait months after year end to decide to go oz even if gains were realized mid year.

So we'll see how attractive this ends up being but don't just think about someone with low-basis stocks or property or family business as the OZ investor. Think about people with short-term gains and corporations with gains too. /End
But if you roll those gains into an OZ, you get deferral until 2026 and the potential 15% haircut on your tax rate -- in dollar terms, that's bigger against the 40.8% rate than against the 23.8% rate. 3/
Normally, the annual tax bite of that--40.8% plus state taxes--is just part of the cost of getting the outsized return. There are ways to minimize it (find some losses). But you're not really like a long-term investor trying to time realization or hold til step-up at death. 2/

@MichaelSLinden @BruceBartlett As you know, the public generally favors raising taxes on high-income people. Democrats used to be more shy about saying that, but we've now had 3 straight elections where the D presidential candidate ran explicitly on tax hikes at the top -- and got more votes.
@BruceBartlett @MichaelSLinden What they underestimated is how taxpayers would respond to that relative gap in the size of tax cuts between those in the middle and those at the top. 		That turned out to be more of a political force than they thought. Yes, @MichaelSLinden, I hear your 'I told you so'
@ernietedeschi @MichaelSLinden @BruceBartlett And, of course, plenty of people will have larger refunds and larger tax bills. And other people will have smaller-than-usual refunds and in fact had smaller tax bills.
@BruceBartlett @MichaelSLinden No doubt TCJA benefits tilt toward the top, but middle quintile gets average cut of 1.6% of after-tax income. Millions pushed off the income tax rolls. Gains, especially in year 1, for families with kids. 		https://t.co/Ua46yCTyXu
@ernietedeschi @MichaelSLinden @BruceBartlett And in terms of salience, even more than half is in 2019, I would guess.
@BruceBartlett @MichaelSLinden That's a factor but not the only factor.
@MichaelSLinden @BruceBartlett Yup. Exactly. 		There is a mode of thinking that if people got tax cuts they would like the law. 		That linkage doesn't work as well as it used to (because of heightened awareness of inequality/deficits). On top of that, a lot of people don't realize they got tax cuts.
@BruceBartlett @MichaelSLinden I think they thought it would be more popular than it was.
@ScottElliotG @vicfleischer @MrWalterShapiro Because we've all been having the same conversation for 13 years, we underestimate that the conversation was different before then.
@vicfleischer @ScottElliotG @MrWalterShapiro That is, TCJA isn't the 2005 plan. But a lot of stuff that became staples of various reform iterations were in there.
@vicfleischer @ScottElliotG @MrWalterShapiro Corporate rate reduction (not really on table before 05), full expensing, dramatic AMT reduction, repeal personal exemptions, SALT cap, territoriality.
@MrWalterShapiro @ScottElliotG Sure. But the dynamics that caused them to lose those seats -- mostly Trump and partly SALT -- are still going to be there in 2020.
@ScottElliotG @MrWalterShapiro #DBCFT 2037!

Why this matters: When House Dems attempt to roll back/repeal the SALT cap, they will have almost no allies across the aisle. 		And there will be lots of Ds from low-tax, low-income states who will have good reason to take a position other than "repeal the SALT cap."

@justreadingdon1 @TristanVick @colinwilhelm @LPDonovan From here? There are plenty of Rs who would get rid of more breaks to drive rates down or who think that lower taxes would pay for themselves.
@justreadingdon1 @colinwilhelm @LPDonovan I think the suburban/education shift is real but for reasons far beyond this.
@colinwilhelm @LPDonovan That seems awfully specific, but if you've had your house in a fast-growing area (like, I don't know, a suburb of any Sun Belt city) for 40 years, that's where you are.
@colinwilhelm @LPDonovan Also, as a side thought, there is a very politically salient property tax SALT demographic -- widow with $35k-$40k income and a $15k property tax bill who is spending down savings and only gets $12k SD now.
@colinwilhelm @LPDonovan I did not appreciate that until I wrote stories about NJ and NY as SALT states (which they are to a greater extent than TX) and my inbox filled up with "actually" emails from Texans.
@Emptyset09 @jamespmanley It's not a perfect analogy. But it also holds up in another way. Ds opposed it but won't fully repeal it. They learned a lesson about promising that.
@jamespmanley At some point, you're going to see Rs pivoting to an argument like what Ds did after ACA -- 'it cost us seats and it was worth losing our seats over.'
@jimtankersley FWIW, Brady says tax cuts --&gt; growth ---&gt; saved GOP seats. And kept Ds below the 37-seat gain you would expect at these POTUS approval levels. Though 37 now seems quite plausible.

@mattyglesias Remember: The Bush tax cuts were passed under reconciliation. They only became permanent with lots of Democratic votes. (And a deal on what expired at the top.)
@mattyglesias You would need revenue raisers or spending cuts or the 20-year window or somesuch to make it work. Also a narrower GOP majority with some SALT guys adds complexity.
@mattyglesias That doesn't do much for you. Because the revenue loss starts in 2026, phaseouts would have to start soon after.

But if you see any clever tax-planning opportunities that are opened by this, lemme know.
In the 1950s, Congress enacted Section 271, which prevented bad debt deductions for loans to parties. The IRS memo clarifies that 501c4s that advocate for candidates count (seemingly on a bright-line yes or no test).
You can't get deductions for contributions to a 501c4. So can you loan money to a c4 that advocates for candidates and then write it off as a bad debt? Nope, says the IRS.

@StevenTDennis The mellifluous TRUIRJCA.
@LiberalDem101 He said they were "putting in" a tax cut. If "putting in" means "enacting," that's obviously not happening as I say. But "putting in" could just as easily mean "submitting ideas to Congress," which they certainly can do in the next 10 days.
@jimtankersley Well, just now he said Congress would vote after the midterms and they would put in a "resolution" before the midterms. If by "resolution," he means "bill" or "proposal" or "bullet points," they could do that. "Resolution" isn't really a thing in this context.
@jimtankersley With this caveat. In a typical White House, the president's statements are the careful end-product of staff work. In this White House, that process sometimes works in reverse, where he speaks and then something happens later. 		So something could yet come of this.

@DavidMillerTax Not clear yet what that sale after 5 does to the gain. (I think)

@HarrySteinDC @TylerEvilsizer @AlexParkerDC @MichaelSLinden @jimtankersley @loujacobson Here's the test: Would anyone arguing for "nominal dollars" as the right measure be satisfied if their investment portfolio were 0.4% higher in nominal dollars compared to a year ago?
@SethHanlon Like if it's a $50,000 pizza oven (I made up that number) that own, it's $50k but if you lease it is there a discount? 		I don't know but I don't think so.
@SethHanlon It counts the same as owned property, I think.
@MichaelSLinden @jimtankersley @AlexParkerDC @loujacobson Also, any increase is basically a result of the increase in revenue from the payroll tax that they didn't touch.
Under Treasury's new 70-30 test, "substantially all" of the e-mail I have received today is unsolicited PR pitches from Opportunity Zone experts.
@MarcGoldwein In April -- when people were still paying their 2017 taxes -- revenue was up over the prior year. 		It has been down every month since then and that's setting aside whether nominal dollars are the best measure. (It's not.)
@gregleiserson Yeah, that's my hunch too. And it gave us things like the 63% figure I cited before and the fact that Treasury considered a 90-10 rule instead of 70-30. Normally, you wouldn't know that in a tax reg unless it happened between proposed and final.
@Micah_Stewart What other gains are people wanting to use?
@gregleiserson I do think we did get some pros-and-cons analysis in there that shows paths not taken, which is (I think) atypical.
Though I imagine one would have to be careful if you're on that bubble to not have your non-zone assets growing in value faster than your in-zone assets and fail the test one year. [reminder that you should get your legal, tax and investing advice from someone who is not me.]
Treasury made its Opportunity Zone fund regs quite taxpayer-friendly to spur investment quickly. A fund can have as little as 63% of its assets in the zone in some circumstances. (see page 41 of the reg). 		Read my updated story here: 		https://t.co/rkzmED7Nd8

@LisaJohnson Yup. And presumably the shareholders would direct investments to companies that were previously cash constrained and have new opportunities with a lower tax bite. But not that many corps were cash constrained.
@econwonk @BCAppelbaum Yeah, I wouldn't sleep on the idea of EBIT, GILTI rate and R/D amortization potentially getting turned off.
Data are early and mixed. 		So far, I haven't seen much outside that mainstream view, that TCJA will provide a short-run boost to demand and some supply-side gains in the longish run but not enough to "pay for themselves." 		But let's see where the evidence goes. /End
So even in the world where this pays for itself -- a world well outside the views of mainstream conservative, nonpartisan and liberal economists -- there would be a significant revenue loss in the early years. 		Are we seeing that investment and seeds of future faster growth? 3/
The idea of "tax cut grows economy so much it pays for itself" wasn't about year 1. It was about investment now and raising long-run growth rate. 		Via JCT, note how the ratio of revenue gains from tax reform (row 2) to static cost (row 1) grows over time. 2/ https://t.co/kuILwCFD9E
Let's try this succinctly. 		@jimtankersley nicely rebuts the "revenue is up" argument. 		Revenue is not up, in inflation-adjusted terms, in GDP terms, in post-effective-date terms, all of it. When someone says that, send them Jim's story.		But. 1/		https://t.co/7E4TyCV2bP
@econwonk @BCAppelbaum Right, but does "extend TCJA" mean turn off the time bombs set to go off between now and 2025?
@econwonk @BCAppelbaum Oh, and the use of EBIT for interest limitation.
@econwonk @BCAppelbaum Does that assume R/D amortization and GILTI rate hike and such get turned off? And expensing? Or just the extension of expiring individual breaks?
@SethHanlon This outcome -- foreseeable for these pre-TCJA high effective rate companies -- was exactly why Dave Camp included a bank tax in his plan.
RT @bykowicz: Ha! But to find out how Beto O’Rourke is *really* spending his campaign millions, check out my new WSJ story:	https://t.co/BD…
@derekalbin yes. I think that's what's going on here.
@derekalbin Ah. So I *think* the IRS argument here would be that 199A's reference to 1202 and the conference report's reference to 448 is about the list of industries, not the level that makes it a service business and that 199A gives Treasury authority to say what counts as an SSTB.
@ruudboy I mean, the people who are the ones producing the bulk of the income. 		And the statute definitely means athletes -- Trout can't just become Mike Trout LLC and get a 20% deduction. MLB is balking at what happens to team owners.
@econwonk @StevenTDennis is that sovereign holdings or holdings by sovereigns plus corps in that location?
@derekalbin Where are you seeing that? This is the relevant clip from reg: https://t.co/j15cH0sPiE
@ruudboy Yes. That's my point in the consulting example below. But realistically, in the main service businesses Congress targeted here (law, medicine, accounting), the prime earners are the worker/owners. MLB isn't quite like that.
Also, even if the performance of athletic services is only a small part of what a baseball team does, the IRS rule says that a business that is more than 5% athletic services is a service business and can't get the tax break. 		See today's story: 		https://t.co/FKU3qr7f6H
@davelevinthal Ouch.
@tnix113 Our friends at EY's tax lobbying arm are handling this one.
I come back to this counterexample. If I bought a consulting firm, did no consulting myself, employed non-consultants in the back office and took no wages, wouldn't that make me like an MLB owner? 		And if I can do that and get out of SSTB treatment, wouldn't every SSTB do that?
But it's not clear to me that that purpose and the statutory language line up (though MLB makes a case that they do and should).
And I see their point here -- that the purpose of the SSTB guardrails was to prevent wage income from being turned into business income. That's not something the owners could do here. https://t.co/TrJcIjcuAM
Here MLB argues that baseball teams are not performing athletic services. https://t.co/NaZWlDg9HX

@lauren_marinaro I think their point is that their franchisees would be the service providers. This is basically the MLB argument -- that if you are one step removed from the service provider you are not a service provider. 		Cans of worms here.

@scottlincicome @kpomerleau @WSJ Signing up to speak at hearing and ask. Brb.
@scottlincicome @kpomerleau @WSJ Writing is not a specified service, as I understand it.
Next question: If a lender routinely buys loans from retailers offering product financing, is the lender lending (eligible) or dealing (ineligible)?
Actual thing just said: "I love regulations. [laughter] I don't mean it that way. I love the examples in the regulations."
@TopherSpiro @BCAppelbaum I'm not saying that. I'm just saying that you can't make that conclusion now and that the mainstream expectation is that they won't pay for themselves.
Car dealers' rep walking through how the multiple-entity structure used by dealerships may create some service businesses that are ineligible for the break even though the business would qualify as one entity.
@BCAppelbaum There were structural deficit concerns over a long horizon even before TCJA.
@BCAppelbaum In the JCT estimate, the static cost declines over time and the macro feedback revenue increases. 		That doesn't mean it pays for itself of course. But that's the pattern you would expect.
@BCAppelbaum Under the theory of how this law would pay for itself in part or in whole, though, there would be first year losses, made up later after growth and investment. 		That said, credible analysis from all sides of the political spectrum said TCJA wouldn't fully pay for itself.
To be clear, we likely won't get answers today from IRS. We will get a clearer sense of the issues. https://t.co/LeY6DIymFd
Important update because I know you all care. The temperature in here is approaching 199 degrees. 		My kingdom for a duct to Longworth.
I can hear the "I told you so" from everyone who said 199A was a bad idea and said it would lead to arbitrary line drawing and gaming.
Another key question: Does income from rental real estate amount to a trade or business? If it does, that would help people who own some rental property but don't have that as their primary occupation. 		The law is squishy here.
We are now learning about the difference between "consulting," which is not eligible for the break and "staffing," which seems to be eligible because those latter temp workers are not providing advice.
I have already lost count of the number of times we have heard the word "subsection."

Anyway, @KateDavidson is your guide to today's data release. Here's her story. More updates coming: 	https://t.co/lCnBrndMEu
But in another sense, not all of TCJA is baked into the FY18 numbers. April revenue was up $55B over 2017 -- but that was from taxes paid under the prior law. 		Since April, in purely dollar terms, revenue has been below the 2017 levels in all five months.
In one sense, that's exactly what you would expect from a tax cut structured like TCJA. If it causes growth and pays for part of itself, that happens over multiple years and you would expect revenues/GDP to go down in year one.
This is the key chart from today's fiscal year-end Treasury release. In dollar terms, it was spending that drove the deficit higher. But in GDP terms, spending actually declined in FY18 -- and it was the tax cut that increased the deficit. https://t.co/Gf7TXHkYJL

@AlexParkerDC It would be gaming -- finding a non-active owner as a way to get the true high-income service providers the benefits of the tax break they weren't supposed to get. 	(Setting aside rules/laws/whatever on non-doctors, non-lawyers owning those firms. Used consulting for a reason.)
That fact pattern is rare in medicine, law, etc but if SSTB turns on owner's activity, then everyone will find a passive owner who can get the tax break and share it back with the service providers through the business.
If I, a non-consultant, bought a consulting firm and did no consulting while managing its HR, payroll, finances, real estate, would that make my consulting firm income not an SSTB?
They argue that the owners aren't engaged in the performance of services in athletics because there are a lot of other components of the business. But...
@RyanLEllis @ScottElliotG That is absolutely a challenge facing Dems and why the timeline will be slower. That's a factor weighing in favor of JCT analysis and report instead of document dump.
Update: The American Bar Association's tax section says the IRS should let sports franchise owners get the tax break. 		See pages 43-45 here: 		https://t.co/Q66Pu320ue
@RyanLEllis @ScottElliotG I mean, they might? Also they can ask for gift-tax returns and audit correspondence. There's a giant file over there. It's not gonna tell them everything but I also don't think Dems will get a pile of numbers, say, eh, didn't learn anything, and move on.
@RyanLEllis @ScottElliotG Depends what the scope of the request is.
@ScottElliotG @JesseFFerguson @HarrySteinDC Well, it would mean his financial disclosures were false?
@IvanTheK @ScottElliotG I've spent a lot of time gaming this out in my head, because it is the most obvious tax thing that is going to happen in 2019 if Democrats win the House. 	Extenders? TCJA changes? Sure maybe but this is the first big fight.
@IvanTheK @ScottElliotG Also possible. And would save Neal from a bunch of messy cross pressures, at least temporarily.
@ScottElliotG Note that Neal and Wyden have committed to request the returns but have been cautious about promising release.
@ScottElliotG But of course your general point -- returns would tell us lots of stuff but not everything you could imagine -- is of course correct.
@ScottElliotG Timeline will be slower than that. At a minimum, House Ds will want to analyze and redact (SSNs and other people's info) before release. 		At a maximum, a protracted legal fight.

@BCAppelbaum I guess technically, under 6103, a determined majority of the House Ways and Means Committee could just obtain and release all returns.
@taxjusticewonk @ScottElliotG Snark response: We're going to build a wall around the US tax base and the shareholders of multinational corporations are going to pay for it. And so are some of the workers depending on your view of incidence.
@ScottElliotG @taxjusticewonk Although, of course, this approach at 21% is a lot more sustainable than at 35%.
@ScottElliotG @taxjusticewonk Even a 50-50 inversion rule would still mean that lots of US companies could get bought by foreign-resident firms. You would need a super BEAT, too.
@nycsouthpaw @NickRiccardi @mattyglesias Mnuchin hasn't said he won't comply or will comply or when he would comply. (I don't think he's been asked.)
@nycsouthpaw @NickRiccardi @mattyglesias Correct. Statute provides no enforcement mechanism if the secretary doesn't comply, so then all the "does the House have standing?" nerds have to argue.
@lunasandwichbot @nycsouthpaw @NickRiccardi @mattyglesias It was more of like "here are the options, which have some pros and cons.;"
@nycsouthpaw @NickRiccardi @mattyglesias The challenging decisions for Dems aren't in whether or not to request. They're in what happens if Trump/Mnuchin say no and in how to analyze the returns and what pieces to make public.
@nycsouthpaw @NickRiccardi @mattyglesias Note: I am not endorsing this strategy. But you can bet that House Dems are gaming through some of these scenarios.
@NickRiccardi @mattyglesias Right. One could make a case that the president is different. One could also just as easily imagine how this escalates.
@mattyglesias For sure. Point is that Senate Rs could obtain returns of anyone (pick your Democratic bogeyman).		Important for this and for Trump returns is that it's not just income tax returns that are available. It's taxpayer correspondence with IRS, gift tax returns, audit records, etc.

@nbeaudrot Not clear. Presumably one could do that, but don't take your personal/business tax advice from me.
That's the phase we're in of the Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act,. Congress' sketches have to be filled in, bit by bit, paint color by paint color, through a tug of war between IRS and taxpayers. Also, this would affect a National Tug of War League too, I guess. End/	https://t.co/mleev9Tr3N
But the messy part is businesses mixing service and non-service income. How much of a team's income is really from "athletics" vs merchandise or broadcasting or whatever? 	That's a big question MLB and IRS are fighting over and you can imagine it happening in other industries. 9/
Quick analogy: If you, a non-doctor, bought a large medical practice from some physicians, should you be able to get the tax break even if they couldn't? 	That seems like a weird result and the law and the regs say no. To the IRS, that's roughly what the MLB team owners are. 8/
In law and medicine, that generally doesn't matter. But in athletics and performing arts, the business owners aren't the service performers. Should that matter? 7/
Athletics is on that list -- you wouldn't want Steph Curry or Bryce Harper to just route their salaries through LLCs and get a 20% tax cut. 		But here's the catch (darn it, can't avoid the jokes): The law just keys off of the underlying business, not what the owner does. 6/
Congress settled on kicking "service businesses" out of the deduction. Those are the industries where it's easiest to turn labor income into business income. Law, medicine, consulting, etc. 5/
And I get the case for taxing high-end labor higher than business income (labor is less mobile) but I also can see the case against it. 	Anyway, there was talk about an active vs passive distinction, but that led to some odd inequities where owners who did less got more. 4/
Ok, fine. So there's going to be a break for pass-throughs. But you need some kind of guardrails to prevent people from turning higher-taxed labor income into lower-taxed business income. 	Otherwise, lawyers, doctors, etc. just check some boxes and get a tax cut. 3/
The problem here stems from the whole idea of pass-through/C corp parity. If the C corps were going to get a tax cut, so were the pass-throughs. As much as I appreciate the "if you don't like the rate, incorporate" slogan, that was just the political reality. 2/

@AlanReynoldsEcn Yes. This is roughly in line with predictions. But I see a lot of "look! revenues are up!" rhetoric out there.
@seanp33 Broadly, if investments are cheaper they become more profitable and companies make more of them. Plenty of debate about the speed and magnitude of all that.
That's not to say that the tax cut is not spurring growth. Or that, especially in the long run, it won't recoup some of its costs. 		But just-above-flat year to year revenue is not the same thing as the tax cut paying for itself.
The story explains this in detail. But the increase is because people paid taxes in April under the old law. 		And with inflation and population increasing, flat revenue doesn't let the government buy the same services it did in the prior year (without borrowing). https://t.co/tab0xgMHXJ

Normally, a growing economy means US tax revenue will climb right with it. But it is the year of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and tax collections went up just 0.4%.  https://t.co/2ElUB2APRI via @WSJ and @katedavidson
@bencasselman Definitely right of center.
@SecVII Yes. Plus the timing shifts that encouraged companies to push income to 18 and expenses to 17. And of course economy will (presumably) keep growing so the base does get bigger.
@StevenTDennis That is, if you gave random competitive House candidate an extra $1M or $2M they would be able to spend it in ways that would increase their odds of winning. But $10M or $20M? Dunno.
@CamperWatcher27 Total revenue up 0.4%, which is of course well below wage growth. Which is what happens, especially in the near term, when you cut taxes.
@SecVII But one quarter of the fiscal year was before the tax cut. And a bunch of companies are on non-calendar fiscal year and had even less of their tax cut happen in federal fiscal 18.
@StevenTDennis Agree. Though I think the great mystery is that it's not actually always clear what kinds of campaign spending would change elections/votes. Definitely some diminishing returns.
Some facts I just looked up. The 31% drop in corporate tax revenue put FY18 at $205B. That's the lowest since 2011. 		And, even without adjusting for inflation, that's below corporate tax revenue in fiscal 2000. (Which was the peak pre-2001 recession.)		https://t.co/2ElUB2APRI
@SecVII @KateDavidson @WSJ #ThanksObama?
A key reason why federal revenue didn't drop? A big April as people paid their 2017 taxes -- under the old law. 	In every month since then, revenue has been lower in 2018 than in 2017.

@SadFndngFathers That was not meant as whataboutism. It was an example of how a disclosure that's only about income tax returns only can limit what we can see.
Not to mention employment tax records or excise tax records. 		So one thing to watch, as Democrats shape their demands post-election if they win the House and/or Senate is how broad the scope gets and how far back it goes. /End

@AndyGrewal What is your view of how 7217 would play into that?

@AKermodeBear @WSJ It's a very broad power. Requires a committee vote for disclosure but other than that, not really.
@jeffhauser @MdotClure @chrislhayes @LPDonovan So yeah, there is an interesting question about what Mnuchin and Rettig would do. There's also a potential IRC 7217 issue that comes up, though. It's really messy and they could try to drag this out.
@dreamwriter9 @jaketapper @WSJ story makes that clear.
@AKermodeBear @WSJ Congress, which is elected, writes the laws and gave itself this power.
@carmstrong07 @WSJ You will note the absence of the word "subpoena" in my story.
@chrislhayes @LPDonovan As I've said before, tax returns don't tell you everything. But they don't tell you nothing. And every peek inside his finances has proven revelatory even if not politically or legally dispositive.
The big choices will fall to @RepRichardNeal, who's in line to chair the Ways and Means Committee. He knows this is uncharted territory and told me that he's consulting with staff and lawyers and wants to be "very meticulous" about how Dems approach this.
The first decision for House Democrats is easy -- request the tax returns if they win the majority. 		The next step is much trickier. How do they analyze them and how do they decide what to make public? 		https://t.co/EtbBmeqtRA via @WSJ

And second, the building-supply company thing is in a category of its own. Man. Not saying no one else ever did something like that. But again, you typically just don't see that kind of documentation without a drawn-out court case.
Two additional thoughts. First, some of the tax planning here (GRATs, valuation discounts, low appraisals) is standard rich-people stuff. What's impressive about the NYT piece is how well-documented all of that is to show how aggressive they were.
@BenBrodyDC And I'm not saying they made the right or wrong decision. I'm just noting that it's not done lightly.
Another underexplored area (because it's hard/impossible to know much) is Trump's own estate planning.
Also, happy second day at work to new IRS commissioner Chuck Rettig.
One other thought: Trump himself said he was audited every year starting in 2002. This story -- thorough and exhaustive and detailed and impressive as it is -- doesn't even get into any of whatever the IRS looked into the past 16 years.
@DPRK_UN_reports To be clear, I'm not saying that those characterizations are justified or unjustified. I just am saying that I've been in newsrooms long enough to know that they are not used without a lot of thought and lawyering.

@gelbach Because you're trying to gauge how much those dollars actually change the distribution of income/wealth. I'm not saying, by the way, that other measures are worthless or should be ignored.
@gelbach Yeah, the $$ go to the top, but that's where income and tax  payments are concentrated. measuring as a share of after-tax income adjusts for that.
@gelbach Depends how you measure it. My preferred was is % change in after-tax income and yes, by that measure, households at the top do better than middle-class. But on average, both get tax cuts. And high-income households are more likely to pay more.
Neal is saying that Rs want to give the 3-4 house owner a bigger tax cut. I don't think that's what Wenstrup was saying. He was saying that the GOP tax agenda hasn't helped the people that Dems say it has helped -- and that that's OK with him.
This is just some helpful caution -- when you hear about how "the rich" are doing, there are multiple ways to slice the data to make points that seem to contradict each other but are both true. end/

@UghObWi So they each have a legal argument, citing statute etc. The chief counsel memo/chamber letter/etc. are linked in the story.
Side note: If this changes corporate behavior so they underpay or work harder to avoid overpayments, that could cause a blip in short-run revenue numbers. So when we see corporate tax receipts go down, it's obviously mostly the rate cut, but it could partly be this effect.
Corporations routinely overpay their taxes to avoid penalties and interest, then get refunds or credits toward future years. 		This year, getting those overpayments back isn't so easy, and companies are frustrated: 		https://t.co/h2zCXCsgav via @WSJ

@ChuckCBPP Absolutely. Relative to the current-law baseline, it is regressive in both 2018 and 2025. But just less so as time goes on.
@UghObWi well it's 96% to the top quintile.
The top 1% of households would get 56.5% of the benefit of repealing the SALT cap in 2018. 		Worth noting: Because the $10,000 cap is NOT indexed, repeal gets less regressive over time. In 2025, the top 1% would get 48.2% of the benefit. https://t.co/LTwxOCXJnb

@Brad_Setser yes, except that it's potentially lumpy because so much of the cash was in a handful of companies. If MSFT/ORCL/AAPL/GOOG all move at once....
@Brad_Setser And yes, most analysts and people who looked at the numbers would have said that. The "$4T-$5T coming back shortly" is a minority view -- held and trumpeted repeatedly by the president.
@Brad_Setser Hard to distinguish 2018 profits and pre-2018 profits in the BEA data. Apple, Alphabet, etc. all still making new foreign profits. The steady-state $35B a quarter should land larger after the one-time bump.
@ForemanTaxLaw I don't think so, because for most of them, the cost of repatriation itself doesn't carry a material tax cost. In other cases, they reversed the PRE designation and took a small charge for withholding taxes, sometimes as part of the one-time tax charge.
So if your expectation/prediction was "cash-rich companies have about $1.5T-$2T in liquid assets and will bring back much of that over 2018/2019" you're right. 	If you're saying "There is $4T-$5T and all of it's going to come back very shortly" that's not happening.
Then there's the question about whether this is faster or larger than we would have thought. Companies, in filings and comments to us, are cautious about taking their time. And many don't have significant cash to bring back anyway--they reinvested in hard assets abroad.
Beyond that, many companies are being very opaque about what they've done, arguing that repatriations are no longer material.  Large undisclosed repatriations from Alphabet, Microsoft, Oracle and Apple could explain a lot of the difference.
And some of what's coming back are 2018 profits under the territorial system, not repatriation of past stockpiles. I have no idea how much of the $395B that is. 		And we only looked at 108 companies. There are plenty more out there, including a few large privately held MNCs.
Pre-TCJA, companies were repatriating $35B a quarter, so you would expect $70Bish. So there were $465B of repatriations, but the delta is really more like $395B. That's still a lot of money.
So how do we square that data with our story from earlier in the week? 	https://t.co/KQgofHgQTp

@JackJjr1640 @MichaelCBender @ChrisMurphyCT @theofrancis As the story notes, the general structure of this -- one-time tax on past profits and then future profits not subject to a tax upon repatriation -- had agreement from Obama and congressional GOP.
@svdate Yes and no. The idea is that it can lead to productivity gains and thus wage increases. And eventually, machines have to be replaced. 	But I do wonder whether, after so many years of bonus depreciation, how much slack there is there.
"Trillions offshore" was a selling point. Though if you ask economists (then and now) they point to other features of the tax law (corporate rate cut, full expensing, burst of deficit financing). 	Those are far more likely to lead to growth -- and likely are doing so now. https://t.co/V9HiEALYdx
@DanCliftonStrat @WSJ If the expectations were based on study of pre-TCJA data, that's one thing. If based on "it will be maybe $5T shortly," that's a different thing. Readers have heard more of the latter.
@DanCliftonStrat @WSJ There are three components to that data -- steady state pre TCJA repay of $35B a quarter, old cash and new profits.
@DanCliftonStrat @WSJ Story makes that point. Money is clearly coming back. No doubt. What's interesting are the pace, the frictions, the caution and the opacity.

@BCAppelbaum Happy to come by and help.
@SecVII @WSJ I don't think you have to get through all your installments to get the cash back.
We contacted 108 companies that had about 90% of the pre-tax-law foreign profits (total for these corps was $2.4T). 		We found just $143B coming back so far. Gov data finds more -- they use confidential surveys. 		https://t.co/KQgofHgQTp via @WSJ

@njagoda Part of the calculation is the "voted with Trump," which can cut both ways depending on the state. Part of it, from a more left perspective is, "This guy seems qualified. If not him, who would we get?"
A few other Dems voting yes too. Will be a pretty favorable vote for Rettig.

@mathIsMight Right. If future taxes, then it's generational shift from today's rich to tomorrow's, probably. If future spending, then it's regressive given who gets transfer payments.
A full TCJA extension -- that included 100% expensing, perhaps turning off the EBIT and R&amp;D and GILTI/BEAT time bombs -- would skew upward a bit more, I think.

Both are accurate. Both can be useful in their own way. I generally prefer tax cut as a % of after-tax income, which gives you a sense of how meaningful the cut is for a particular income group. 		And if it's more than just a tax cut, it's helpful to break out winners and losers.
@kpomerleau I think you can roughly back into that from this chart, but I'll wait for TF and TPC to do it.

@jasonfurman The congressional politics may have been different had Congress not just passed a big, bold proposal (TARP) just a few months earlier and ARRA was thus seen as the primary/first response to the crisis.
@laurapdavison There is always a tax angle. Always.
@TheBudgetGuy @WSJ I have actually gotten out quite a bit in the time since TCJA was signed. But the chill winds of autumn blow from the vents of Longworth and I know where I must be.

@BruceBartlett @MichaelSLinden @JodyShenn That's why Obama and H. Clinton both proposed repealing/scaling back stepped-up basis. Sure, they're not at a mark-to-market type system for the 0.1%.
@BruceBartlett @MichaelSLinden @JodyShenn I mean, I always want more detail from candidates, but under Obama, the top cap gains rate went from 15% to 23.8%. And the Clinton campaign was pretty clear about where she wanted to go. See here:   	https://t.co/HNptmMpjYU

@LPDonovan 2018, man.
@LPDonovan Optically one presumes they want a margin of victory greater than the number of indicted members voting yes.
Watch to see how (or if) Republicans handle those items in 2.0 and in future budgets/plans. And do any of them draw the bipartisan support we've seen on things like Cadillac tax delay?
Adding one point to this. Corporate rate cut and territorial system are permanent. But there are time bombs on the business side too -- expensing phaseout, tighter interest deduction limits, R&amp;D amortization.
@dhmontgomery @levinecarrie But I would be more polite.
@dhmontgomery @levinecarrie This is me in 30 years, maybe fewer.
@GrahamDavidA @RobertWHoward Technically, they could. It's remarkable how politically sticky and sacrosanct county boundaries have become.
@GrahamDavidA @RobertWHoward NCGA could reunite Meck and Cabarrus after 226 years apart.
@TheBudgetGuy @WSJ in relative terms.
@LPDonovan Yes. Though every time I imagined a 24% corporate bill with fewer top-end cuts that drew 8-10 Senate Dems, I could see GOP support fading fast. Which is why they got where they got. They decided it was. not worth the price -- or was impossible or added months.
@Phil_Mattingly @seungminkim Not tomorrow but soon.

This is a very clear distillation of GOP thinking and priority-setting. Republicans looked at pros and cons and made choices. There is sometimes a Byrd Rule fatalism that says sunset was required. It is a choice--an understandable one from the GOP policy/legislating perspective. https://t.co/OeWAKDqI01

@lunasandwichbot Yes. The "downsides" to them of other options were a combination of politics and policy outcomes.

@byrdinator So you're saying you don't have object permanence either.
@byrdinator Try dropping objects on senators' heads and see if that gets you kicked out.

@AndyGrewal Yes, this is all with my usual "don't take tax advice from me; I'm not a lawyer or CPA and I'm just thinking through this out loud" caveat.
@AndyGrewal If you're turning a "profit" on the contribution, you can use some of the proceeds to buy a billboard saying "Andy's Car Wash Supports Public Services!" and still come out ahead. Also, New York could do that.
@AndyGrewal Has to be a real trade or business under 162, but IRS clarification clearly says that it doesn't matter if the business is a corp or not. 	https://t.co/mtAXsLMf6K
@AndyGrewal If you can justify it as advertising or promotion or marketing or somesuch, then it wouldn't be a "donation" per 170 but a busines expense under 162. The Little League sponsorship example...
@AndyGrewal FWIW, here is the Toomey statement, which suggests some malleability: https://t.co/AM0PYdzmvA
@AndyGrewal Treasury's point, as I understand it, is that the SALT regs did nothing to change what is eligible for a 162 deduction.
@ndrichardson @WSJ Eh, you still need to meet the trade-or-business test in 162.
And with the state tax credit your after tax billboard costs wouldn't exceed your combined tax benefit. Again, don't try this at home (without sound legal and accounting advice).
I mean, if you're a NY S corp owner could you just give to the state fund, put up a billboard advertising your firm as a supporter of public services and claim* a 162 deduction for all of it?	(*not tax advice)

@nielslesniewski @TheBudgetGuy That is more acceptable.
@TheBudgetGuy I sometimes use "tax reform" here for brevity's sake. But you won't see it outside quotes in my WSJ copy, more because it carries a non-neutral connotation as opposed to your reason.
@rokumar1918 @MEPFuller Remember that he is a South Dakota native. A state known for its steamships.

@adamnmichel @amoylan One other point, and I'm not sure I've seen data on this. But the $10k cap is not indexed, so I would assume that it will bite harder in blue districts as the decade progresses.
@adamnmichel @amoylan Yes. Perception of losers is higher than the reality because: 	A) The actual number of losers was higher under the House bill. 	B) The numbers moved around so much during Nov-Dec that it was hard to follow for people who are not us. 	C) Losers are louder than winners.
@amoylan @adamnmichel yeah, the D districts are the tails. And probably noisy tails to some extent.

@RandyBauer @jmhorp @JoshuaTMcCabe I like to be different, so I don't even live in a state. Here in the District of Columbia my income, sales and property taxes all contribute to my garbage pickup. (And for anyone it is true if you have property tax funded municipal sanitation.)
@RandyBauer @jmhorp @JoshuaTMcCabe Yes! Double your deduction if they don't miss a garbage pickup.
@JoshuaTMcCabe Does that include severance taxes on oil/gas/coal etc? That would distort a description of the tax burden, no? There's a reason we don't think of WY and ND as high tax states.
@JoshuaTMcCabe But that's an interesting chart. Wonder about merits of that metric vs others (SALT deduction as share of personal income etc.)
@JoshuaTMcCabe Isn't it a relevant part of the argument that the deduction served as a form of indexing for cost of living?

More: "Harbor Lofts as lessee does not have the power to impose	perpetual restrictions on property in which it does not have an absolute right. It	cannot give what it does not have."

@adamnmichel I think the dollar-for-dollar credits can survive. You still can use those to basically direct your state taxes to the charity of your choice. That's a good benefit. Credits between 15% and 100% are less attractive.
@adamnmichel But the argument is: 		A) they're doing so at the expense of the federal fisc. 	B) The feds here aren't preventing states from subsidizing charity, just limiting the federal benefit for doing so.
Treasury punches back against states and taxpayers looking for a path around $10,000 limit on state and local tax deductions. It's the classic cap-and-mouse game. 		My story from today's WSJ: 		https://t.co/nVLcirbAHt via @WSJ
@DanielJHemel But that's a lot of money moving around for not much net benefit to taxpayer.
@DanielJHemel 100 minus something below the rate at which state income tax deductions are taken could also work. So 95% in a state w 7% rate that allows charitable deduction.
@DanielJHemel Plus a state charitable tax deduction too?
@DanielJHemel The more I think about it the more I think the reg (roughly) encourages credits of 15% or 100% and almost nothing in between.
One other note on the Aug 27 effective date. That appears to be the actual Federal Register publication date. So maybe that's why. But IRS certainly does day-of rules sometimes.

@colinwilhelm stand pat and hope for mean reversion.
@Omri_Marian Dunno. My point is just about the salience of refund size and that it can cut multiple ways.
The flip side is true too. People will say "I usually got a $2,000 refund and this year I got $3,000 and TCJA is awesome" even though their taxes may have only gone down by $500.
Absolutely. 		It will be very easy for people to think "I usually get a $2,000 refund and this year I got $1,500 and TCJA is thus bad" even if their overall tax bill went down. https://t.co/ko5p3FDtjs
And these data tell us nothing about the size of refunds/taxes owed. 	All that said, I do expect the 2019 filing season to be messy, because TCJA is disrupting people's usual patterns, and it will vary a lot by type of taxpayer, as GAO shows. 	Thoughts welcome.	End/
So 21% being underwithheld isn't really all that different from where we've been historically. And that's before people use the calculator to adjust.
In 2017, about 40 million people didn't get refunds, meaning they were underwithheld or ended up even or some similar fate. https://t.co/6SIDuP1l2C 3/
It says Treasury's own analysis shows that 21% of wage earners would be underwithheld (owe taxes with return) under Treasury's withholding allowance. That's a lot of people -- about 30 million. But... 2/

@kpomerleau In which case "parity" is tricky to find but it seems like it could be achieved by reducing the QBI deduction.
@kpomerleau Also it looks like pass-throughs have higher rates largely because they don't have tax-exempt shareholders like C corps do.
Johnson adds that TCJA isn't the simplification and rationalization he wanted.
Johnson said he is worried that pass throughs will be left behind if and when tax cuts get extended but not for the top bracket.

@chrislhayes @Realhaloharry @LPDonovan @StevenTDennis Also, because the exemption used to be way lower, the memory within some families of paying the tax is real and out of line with today's exemption.
@Realhaloharry @chrislhayes @LPDonovan @StevenTDennis Business owners who think and hope they will end up with $30M. Even though, probabilistically, they won't.
@chrislhayes @LPDonovan @StevenTDennis Way more people are receptive to estate tax messaging than those who pay it. 	Part of that is misperception. Part of that is aspiration.
@StevenTDennis All this to say, Rs want lower cap gains rates. But they subordinated that to other priorities. Obviously, constraints are different in a Treasury-only decision.
@carmstrong07 @stanveuger @kpomerleau @ScottElliotG @jtraub2 @RayBeeman Tbf I also sometimes focus on stupid things.
@StevenTDennis The 3.8% Obamacare tax on cap gains and dividends is still law. And top marginal rates on cap gains in NY/CA are higher than they were in 2016.
@StevenTDennis It is worth noting how Rs used approximately none of their $1.5T tax cut for cap gains and dividends and chose estate tax shrinkage over repeal.
@87fish Interesting point. Thx.
@AndyGrewal The "Talbots Step Two" joke was basically written for you.

Judge Lauber notes, gently, that fair market value is what a willing buyer would pay a willing seller. https://t.co/Cm3aIDKrFf
This falls in the category that we shall affectionately call #cleverbut 	The "but" here is first that she didn't come close to adequately substantiating the donations. You need a qualified appraisal for noncash contributions, at least when you're doing $34,000-plus a year.
So the idea is that she would buy clothes on steep discounts at Talbot's and then claim the original retail price as the value when donating to Goodwill.

@taxjusticewonk @kpomerleau well, it works the other way on SALT.
@kpomerleau @taxjusticewonk Those statements are self-serving, sure. But to the extent that GILTI is creating foreign ETRs above 13.125% and especially foreign ETRs above 21%, that doesn't seem to be what Congress thought it was doing.
@kpomerleau @taxjusticewonk So that would reduce revenue, but really just reduce revenue back to where we all thought it would be, with GILTI being a 10.5 mintax.
@kpomerleau @taxjusticewonk It's also not clear to me what expense-allocation assumptions were baked into the JCT revenue estimates. That is, this may be companies (not just wall st companies fwiw) arguing for a GILTI that works like the GILTI the conference report describes.

@meatrace @TopherSpiro Buyback gets $$ from companies that don't have investments to make to companies that do. Again, I'm not saying it will pay for itself but volume of buybacks doesn't tell you everything.

Muzinich offers a timing update on 199A regulations: "Very soon."
Grassley just called him "Mnuchin," which, now that I think about it, was inevitable.
We're also going to get at least 7 different pronunciations of "Muzinich" from Grassley alone.

@ThumpForTrump "We" was a nod to my co-author, Laura Stevens, who does a great job covering Amazon in all its opacity.
@ThumpForTrump Where did I read something that explained how Amazon would be affected? Right. We wrote it: 	https://t.co/lOWVZsKrDn
@inajetplane Yes and no. They do on their products, not on all third-party sellers' sales. 	https://t.co/lOWVZsKrDn
@StevenTDennis Yes. Though Wayfair did not provide the national framework that MFA would. So Amazon can legitimately be pro-MFA and conflicted/agnostic on Wayfair.

@DanielJHemel @professortax Under 6103 Ways and Means can review everything and release parts. In that process it is their choice not his on what gets released.

@AlanReynoldsEcn @WSJ Not sure what you're looking at, but June to June corporate taxes are down 33%. And April is a big estimated tax month for 2018 but you can't tell what is that and what is 2017 payments with returns.
@DanCliftonStrat That is, of course, exactly what TCJA was designed to do -- lower withholding to put more $ in people's paychecks and lower corporate taxes. Even the best-case corporate investment argument for TCJA requires immediate deductions (thus lower revenue) up front.
@DanCliftonStrat Further, looking at revenue "this year" isn't relevant. Anything through April 18 is full of pre-tax-cut revenue and the one-time hedge fund deferral. May and June were each down $23B, with individual and corporate income tax declines outweighing rising payroll tax receipts.
@AZTanya like the sitcom theme song says, it was more than just a hunch. It's what accountants and tax lawyers have been telling me for months.
@AlanReynoldsEcn @WSJ And April to April is no good because April 2018 had people's 2017 payments and the deferred hedge fund taxes.

@avishr Yes. Or are newly able to itemize because they can take some SALT and convert to charity. Imagine couple with $5k property tax, $10k income tax, $2k charity, $10k mortgage interest. 	$22k deductions now, but $27k with this change.
@burgessev Apparent lack of cargo shorts could hurt him in key dad demo.
@Bburtcpa They can try! We'll know the answer within 6 years.
@LBLRLST A lot of DC progressives are wary about this idea for just this reason. A $10k or $15k cap on the donations would be more progressive than no limit. But still just for people who pay significant DC income tax and have cash/wherewithal to do this.
@injunacura Eh. Hard to tell. There's clearly desire to do it, but caution on bond-rating effects. And if the IRS takes a hard line, I'm not sure how DC will respond. Would definitely lower the take-up rates.
One other note. DC plan is 90% credit--donate $10k, get $9k off DC income tax bill plus $9k federal charity deduction. 	Residents come out ahead in any federal bracket; DC gets extra $1,000. Bigger percentage gives more of benefit to taxpayer; smaller means more $ for DC govt.
And they're done. We'll just see where this goes -- decent chance that the IRS says something before the full council is ready to vote.
@JoshuaGreen If link to the the MD state legislative hearing happens to show up in my feed on a slow news morning, I will!
Council members wanted the list of existing credits. Here's the law professors' paper with the list: 	https://t.co/IKYhejnJbB
Council member Evans references the existing state tax credits:  	“That Wall Street Journal article caught my eye.”	That would be this one: 	https://t.co/inLyTGLTja
Here's the bill as filed. Note that it's been out there for a while and has 8 of 13 council members in support. But this is the first hearing. 	https://t.co/2guZaNQQtV
And the council members are now joking about how their bond talk is making people flock to their computers to watch. TRUE!
Municipally, as DeWitt is pointing out, DC is odd because it provides the services of a city, county and state all in one, so it's hard to compare to anywhere else.
I've been a DC resident since 2007. I have a professional and personal interest in municipal government. And still I think this is maybe only the second or third DC council meeting I've ever watched.
DC SALT workaround could lower federal taxes for 49,000 DC taxpayers by a total of $330 million.
@keith_d_m_g Yes. DC's finances were a debacle 20-30 years ago and a lot of hard work and economic growth have put the district in much better shape. And that history tends to make policy makers quite cautious.
Also, listening to a municipal finance officer describe meetings with bond raters and warning about downgrades is giving me severe 2004 flashbacks.
@keith_d_m_g Varies by jurisdiction and its bond covenants.
Scary as in municipal borrowing costs go up and bondholders may in some cases be able to start asking for their money back.
And... “This gets pretty scary without a cap.”
One option it looks like he's building up to -- cap the SALT workaround credit somewhere between $5000 and $50000 per filer because an unlimited credit could cause big problems for DC borrowing, especially in a recession.
DC's income-tax-secured bonds are rated higher (AAA/AA+) than its GO bonds because bondholders get paid first under the former. So a less steady income tax stream could cause problems.
I believe this is the CFO still speaking -- potential concerns about bond covenants because of bonds secured with income tax revenues.
It's better on my phone so now I'm not sure whether to blame DC or Dow Jones.
Live stream is kinda clunky. Representation without televisation or some such.
Potential DC SALT workaround is up for debate now. https://t.co/2IxjEuJNzx

@ms_scherholz @kairyssdal Not saying that really should be much of a consideration. I'm just noting a byproduct of this decision.
More to come this week, but here's one stray thought on the draft 1040. Taking items off the main form and putting them on schedules means that a politician who releases only the main form is disclosing way less information than before.
@TheStalwart Expect more along these lines: "If Republicans can pass a $1 trillion tax cut and say it will pay for itself in contradiction of nonpartisan estimates and not worry about that or lose seats to deficit hawks, then Democrats can spend money and be less fixated on 'paying for it.'"
@cards_fan_66 Isn't MO getting rid of some of those anyway? Or planning to? 	One option would be to say that the net benefit can't be greater than 100%. So an 85% credit could be clipped for someone in 35% bracket but not for someone in the 12% bracket?

One last thing. The president has, as I've pointed out, said false things about taxes. It is, however, true, that the US used to lack an income tax and funded (a much much much) smaller government with tariffs and some other stuff. /end
Is there a tax you could use to replace/significantly reduce major pieces of the current US tax system? VAT did you say? 	https://t.co/gQkN0yx5yf
And to the point @StevenTDennis makes, I can't imagine what tariffs one would need today to replace income tax revenue, even putting aside the fact that the US is running sizable budget deficits on existing revenues.
The income tax also made it easier for the US to pay for wars. And to expand government spending. Depending on your politics, you may view these as good or bad ends.
The income tax also made the US less reliant on alcohol taxes, which enabled Prohibition. (I've been reading Daniel Okrent's "Last Call" which walks through the alliance between progressives and "the drys.")
The 16th Amendment to establish the income tax was, in part, created to make the US less reliant on tariffs.
