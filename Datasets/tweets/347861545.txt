@cableBROAD The benefit of our system is that all who wish to have it are given an opportunity to weigh in on each of the bills we consider. Sometimes that means 18 hour bill hearings, but that’s the price we pay. While it can be exhausting, I don’t think I’d have it any other way.
Packed house in judiciary committee today for our bill hearings on 12 bills. #MDpolitics #MDGA2019 https://t.co/GdRV1yVuyh
Debate has just begun on the #FightFor15 bill #mdpolitics #Working4MD https://t.co/WEZkqA5zgV
Hearing adjourned at 3:55 am https://t.co/mZBzjhMpio
Beginning our last bill at our 16th hour! Love all the engaged advocates on all sides of these issues
@KenKerr3B A lot have left and many are doing “me too” testimony, agreeing with people testifying before them so it’s moving quicker now.
Now entering hour 12 of our marathon “gun day” hearings. With over 1200 people signed up to testify we are on bill 8 of 19! #democracyinaction #MDPolitics #MDGA19 https://t.co/vOPcn7pFph
So sweet! A mom in support of my name change bill from yesterday wanted to testify but couldn’t bc of snow. She just stopped by to say hello and thanks today! So nice to meet her in person! #advocacymatters https://t.co/U5QqEvWcYJ
@PCMC1 The bill includes language requiring the applicant to certify they’re not requesting the change for fraudulent or illegal purposes and a separate provision specifically related to whether the person has ever registered as a sexual offender &amp; past names used.
@PCMC1 Will also be adding language around whether individual has ever been convicted of a violent crime, at the recommendation of a colleague.
Preparing to deliver a subset of the testimony submitted in support of my bill HB659, which will raise the min age of detention in MD from 7 to 12 for non-violent offenses. This will bring us up to UN recommendations, and have Maryland lead the nation. #MDpolitics https://t.co/0Ahd2hghWn
Just presented my bill HB1005 that will simplify the name change process &amp; remove the requirement to publish the change in a widely circulated newspaper. This will be especially helpful to domestic violence survivors and LGBT individuals. #MDPolitics https://t.co/nw9aqqx56Y

@mkorman Ha! Thanks @mkorman!
This was such a fascinating facility to visit. The CEO was motivated to start the company to help find treatments for a rare pediatric lung disease her daughter developed. The work they’re doing is so exciting
CEO @markbergel shared a lot of sobering yet great info - many of their services benefit people who own less than 10 total possessions and earn &lt;16k for a family of 4. Solutions to eradicating poverty- job training, child care and transit
The overwhelming feedback from our group was how impressed everyone was with the students who joined us for the visit. I enjoyed meeting several great kids today!
Last stop today - Marriott HQ in Bethesda where we learned about the company’s expansion plans in downtown Bethesda and their advocacy around strengthening metro service and tourism. (Forgot to get a pic!)
We then visited United Therapeutics in downtown Silver Spring where we explored their state of the art research and manufacturing facility for products that treat patients with rare lung disorders. We also heard from CE @Marc_Elrich who addressed our group https://t.co/rx9a8XkGzE

@MaraGreengrass I don’t know when this happened! I swear he used to be an amazing sleeper. Now not so much!
He just stood up, super slowly, as though rising from a swamp in a scary movie. Stared me down from over his crib rail. “Mommy?! I love you mommy!” Now he’s just manipulating me. #toddlerlife
He hasn’t had a lollipop in six months. It clearly made an impression. If I give him a carrot tomorrow and not again for six months, will he ask me for one on repeat in six months?! #toddlerlife #pleasesleep
I’m no longer answering. Just hanging in his chair while he tries to sleep. Except now it’s just “can I get a lollipop mommy?” On repeat. #willheeversleep #toddlerlife
He’s making animal sounds, in between random gibberish songs. In between demands for lollipops. #pleasegotosleep #toddlerlife
