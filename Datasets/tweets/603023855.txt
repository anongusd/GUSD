Immigrant moms only make 67¢ to a white dad’s dollar and their ability to work is increasingly threatened by regressive immigration policies. Protecting the legal status of immigrant women is an imp. step toward #MomsEqualPay. #DACA #TPS #ProtectFamilies https://t.co/JAw2Wc9QT1
Latina moms are paid just 46¢ for every $1 paid to white, non-Hispanic dads. This is not okay – they need #MomsEqualPay! https://t.co/5Z4F6xny8S

Want to secure #EqualPay for working moms? Expand access to high quality, affordable #childcare. https://t.co/3jRD6R2uVD via @ShriverCenter #EqualPay #MomsEqualPay #GenderWageGap
FACT: The #wagegap between mothers and non-mothers is greater than between women and men. #MomsEqualPay https://t.co/GYAQoYRp1c
Without both #fairpay and #paidsickdays, it's harder for women to access #reprohealth care when deciding if/when/how to start or grow their families. #MomsEqualPay
The #PaycheckFairnessAct would help bridge the wage gap for all moms. Let’s fight for #MomsEqualPay!
On #MomsEqualPay, let's remember that incarcerated moms are cherished family members &amp; friends whose absence &amp; presence counts. The damage of incarceration lasts long after release &amp; its stigma prevents moms from getting #equalpay &amp; fair treatment at work.
All hardworking women and moms deserve to be paid equally &amp; recognized for their contribution to the national economy. #MomsEqualPay

Hispanics in the US are disproportionately vulnerable to the effects of #ClimateChange, and Trump's administration is doing everything it can to make the situation worst. We must fight back 💪🏽🌎 https://t.co/bO4igWvEX9
75% of the US's farm labor workforce is Hispanic. These farmworkers are susceptible to exposure to toxic pesticides. Recklessly, the EPA has worked to roll back safeguards against pesticides which are a danger to farmworkers &amp; the environment. #EarthDay
@SecretaryZinke's Department of the @Interior auctioned 77 million acres of federal waters to oil &amp; gas companies for deep sea drilling. Hispanic communities rely on these waters for food, work, and recreation. The orders to expand offshore drilling will hurt this way of life.
92% of Hispanic voters agree they have a moral responsibility to "forests, the oceans, lakes and rivers." We deserve officials who protect lands for the long-term, not destroy them for short-term profits. #EarthDay
Hispanics are 165% more likely to live in counties with unhealthy levels of pollution. Health threats to Hispanic families will surely increase after Trump's @EPA shredded a policy that focused on reducing hazardous air pollution from industrial sources. #EarthDay
#ClimateChange is a serious threat to people with breathing conditions. Hispanics are 40% more likely to die from asthma than non-Hispanic whites. The @EPA's rollback of the clean car standards will hurt air quality &amp; perpetuate environmental injustice. #EarthDay
#ClimateChange increases heat waves, severe storms, air pollution, &amp; the spread of disease. Yet, @FEMA has stopped preparing for its disastrous effects, which affects Hispanics who are among the most vulnerable to extreme weather events. #EarthDay https://t.co/qiHGUdjcLT
Hispanics are disproportionately impacted by poor water quality throughout the U.S., so protecting waterways is vital. Trump disregarded this fact when he ordered the @EPA to review the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act. #EarthDay
Hispanics care deeply about the environment because it's a matter of health and safety. Trump's @EPA budget would cut the agency by 23% and slash environmental justice enforcement by 70%. This will hurt Hispanics' access to clean air &amp; water. #EarthDay
Did you know? #EarthDay events are held in more than 193 countries worldwide to demonstrate support for environmental protection 🌎💪🏽
Join us and the @HispanicCaucus today at 11AM to celebrate #EarthDay (April 22nd) and highlight how environmental issues impact the Hispanic community in America 🌎

A report by @amprog says undocumented #immigrants granted work permits will add $45 billion in payroll taxes to the economy over 5 years.
Until #Congress steps up to fix our broken #immigration system, #SCOTUS can restore #DAPA &amp; give millions the relief they lawfully deserve.
This lawsuit was brought by opponents of immigrants. For the integrity of the judiciary, #SCOTUS should unfreeze #DAPA &amp; #DACA expansion.
The stakes of this case are high. If #SCOTUS unfreezes #DAPA and #DACA expansion, it will create jobs, expand GDP &amp; add billions in revenue.
It's a great day! We urge #SCOTUS to restore #DAPA &amp; #DACA extension so millions of hardworking #Immigrants can contribute to our economy.
