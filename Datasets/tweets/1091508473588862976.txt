@AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump Trump is apparently much more savvy than you.
@AnnCoulter I’m a lifelong Conservative and I regularly deride liberals for saying this type of thing. “Zero miles”? Really? Trump is doing a fabulous job while dementia sadly takes over yours, Coulter. If you can’t help... stay out of the way.
@LoriinUtah @BernieSanders He’s thinking: ‘sure wish I had one of those vagina hats’
@thehill Hardly. Trump is a far greater man than John McCain.

@MaxGraham5800 @GreekVikingX @mitchx36 @KamowskiDon @g1rad Sad.
@GreekVikingX @mitchx36 @KamowskiDon @g1rad I believe, generally, you’re simply unwilling to admit God exists. It’s not that you don’t know he exists-you’re not ignorant, right?
@ardalansassan @g1rad I tend to agree that Islam was hijacked and perverted by Muhammad. However, that religion originated with Ishmael, son of Abraham.
@ardalansassan @g1rad Actually, Muslims and certainly Jews claim the same God as Christians. There’s only one that can save your soul: Jesus Christ.
@mitchx36 @KamowskiDon @g1rad There are no atheists. Just people who are confused, or too stubborn to admit their belief in God’s existence.

@ja3far2012 @Freakycircus1 @g1rad @jtblueblanket Says God, in the Bible. He’s talking about your knees too...and your tongue.
@ja3far2012 @Freakycircus1 @g1rad @jtblueblanket In the end, ‘every knee shall bow and every tongue confess that Christ is Lord.’
@g1rad I’ve written a book on that topic. By the way, it’s full of “original thought.” The abbreviated answer to your question is: for the same reason Satan doesn’t manifest himself to the world. Such profound manifestations would violate the reasons we were created and placed on earth.
@g1rad The one whom Jesus Christ called Father.
@godfreefinker @jtblueblanket @g1rad Perhaps your lack of reasoning skills is why you’re on the losing side of this topic. Hmmm?
@g1rad I can prove my point about original thought. Within the art of music, there are only 12 tones. All music throughout history has consisted of varied combinations of just those 12 notes. Yet, new, fresh, original music is still common—after 2500 years. Original thought lives.
@g1rad There’s only one true God.
@g1rad I have.
@g1rad No original thoughts? How silly. Perhaps in your tiny world of blind irrationality that’s true. But here in reality there’s no end to original thought. Creative thinkers throughout history have proven it. I’ve proven it!
@jtblueblanket @g1rad That’s the silly response of an intellectual-beggar. Yes, I’m sure the billions of religious people throughout antiquity simply couldn’t cope with dying and made it all up...yeah, right. How about the more reasoned view: they acted on what they experienced?
@JosephNSanberg @HowardSchultz Actually, there’s nothing “un-American” about it. However, taking someone else’s money and giving it to someone who it doesn’t belong to...is very un-American. There’s nothing “American” about state-sponsored theft.

@g1rad Just because you don’t understand something is no reason to consider that your simple thoughts are original. Christ’s bodily death was just that. The spirit of humans never die and neither did Christ’s. See, wasn’t that easy!
@MercysFight Very true! Christians are required to make judgements.
@julesrprecious Right on!
@ByrontheHeathen Perhaps you’re confusing Jesus with Barrack Obama? Jesus didn’t teach or uphold laziness or governmental support. Giving money away to the masses is not something Christ taught His followers. If you’re going to discuss Christianity perhaps you should studyit first.

@midnigh32075066 @Elljay1011 @gdminnis @SteakSandwich1 @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump We would be a far lesser country without freedom to bear arms. Citizens need to be armed.
@KarenSBlake @Elljay1011 @gdminnis @SteakSandwich1 @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump No one would be protected from an armed assailant either. Or a corrupt government...
@midnigh32075066 @Elljay1011 @gdminnis @SteakSandwich1 @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Guns don’t aim at anyone. They just sit there....lonely and silent, until SOMEONE picks it up. Only a fool wouldn’t own a gun in these times.
@SMcpherrin @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump The wall/fence IS going up. No U.S. citizen with integrity would oppose it.
@loweringthebar @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump The wall is neither pointless or expensive, but only those who think so.
@TigerFuzzles2 @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump That’s the liberal mantra, not Trump’s. Liberals feed on irrationality and fear. It’s all they have since their ideas rarely make sense.
@Elljay1011 @gdminnis @SteakSandwich1 @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump No one has ever lost their life “due to guns.” It’s always people that cause loss of life from guns. Always. If laws would fix it, why not make one that says it’s illegal to murder someone? That should fix it, right? Oops, we’ve already got that law! Does it help?
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Right on, LG!
RT @LindseyGrahamSC: @realDonaldTrump Republicans need to get behind President Trump emergency declaration to build wall/barrier.  		Lookin…
RT @LindseyGrahamSC: House Democrats’ border barrier/wall offer is PATHETIC.	 	I hoped that Democrats would make good faith effort to strik…
@craigunger I’m sure he has lost a lot of money. The U.S. is very fortunate to have a man of his caliber in the WH. Trump is a man of good character (we can thank liberal investigations for reassurance of that!).
@VP How can a governor make murder legal? What kind of precedent does that set?
