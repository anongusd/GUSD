@Blackmanthinkin Maybe I can help. I said it is a legitimate position to oppose or support the nomination given all the information and what we don't know. Was that the part you did not understand?
@Blackmanthinkin I am not. What was worthless about it?
It is a completely legitimate position to either support or oppose Brett Kavanaugh. There was a lot of information over these past few months and emotional testimonies. There is also a lot we don't know. People are going to come to different conclusions sorting all that out.

Some sad news today everyone. The decision to release Animal Crackers from captivity has resulted in at least one death. A man was trampled by a stampede of giraffe crackers, tiger crackers, camel crackers, kangaroos crackers and elephants crackers.
@albhere I'm a bit disappointed to be honest. It would be so much cooler if you were saying he'd be a prisoner guard. Transitioning from president to prisoner guard would be wild. As is the meme in an uninteresting cliché about Trump going to jail. Might as well just call him Hitler too.
@albhere I'm not. You do realize prisoners don't tend to use the guard towers, right? Hence why they are called guard towers. Like it wouldn't make sense to put Trump in the guard tower if he was a prisoner. This meme lacks common sense. It's a D+ meme at best.
@albhere Then why is the guard tower marked Trump Tower. Wouldn't that imply he's a prison guard? They use those towers for guards, not prisoners.
@albhere Is Trump becoming a prison guard after his presidency?

@patrick_mendis @RightToWork @LifeZette Maybe but workers like Mark Janus feel differently. And the court affirmed that belief.
@patrick_mendis @RightToWork @LifeZette Good point. But it’s important to consider they have no choice. They can’t join another union or find some other way to advocate for themselves once a union gains monopoly rights. Hence why unions are required to represent everyone if they choice exclusive representation.
@patrick_mendis @RightToWork @LifeZette I like you headline a lot but it doesn’t capture the argument. Some workers like Mark Janus disagree with what the union is fighting for. Unions also don’t have to provide benefits to nonmembers by becoming member only, but then they lose monopoly rights.

@billyez2 That's exactly the issue. People went into TLJ with normal expectations so it did well. The impact of it being a bad movie didn't occur until people saw it. Unless fans can predict the future it wouldn't work the way you say.
LucasFilms learned the complete opposite lesson they should have. The issue isn't the spinoffs. The issue is a lot of fans lost interest after Rian Johnson shit the bed.		So instead they reportedly put future spinoff movies on hold but have no such plans for the Rian trilogy.
@CrimsonMama15 Oh no. They had a table so journalists could work. Someone calls an ethics official. I'll report myself to the authorities immediately for taking such a generous gift by putting my laptop and notepad down on the table to work. How could I be so blind.

@hhildebrand12 Hey, me again. It won't let me send you messages unless we're following each other. Sorry about that.
@hhildebrand12 I can't argue with that. Hold on one second and let me find a few. My focus was mostly on Janus but I'm sure there are a few worthwhile shots.
Oh, I got one. The picture literally posted on your wall. Because a supporter of Janus would really wear a hat like that. But man the more you commit the more impressed I become. Any chance of us becoming friends? You seem like my type of people. https://t.co/F9txVUMvXH
My apologies. I didn't realize I was dealing with a professional troll. I respect the commitment though. But more importantly did you have fun out there. I did. It was a good day for a Supreme Court hearing. We should do it again. https://t.co/SMcGHdU9to
@SpencerChretien Thank you!
@2ndAmendLiberal That is a possibility. But also consider the true impact is still unknown. Some right-to-work states see a huge decline while others don't overtime. The federal workforce has had that choice for many years but membership rates remain good. But it could be very bad as well.
I managed to find only two photos of Mark Janus in my camera roll from today that weren't obstructed by signs or blurry. I am quite proud of this one, especially if this case does end up fundamentally changing labor law.		Mark Janus (Connor D. Wolf/InsideSources) https://t.co/COIZ5Amwu6

@our45thPOTUS @AFSCME @Right2Work That's a huge benefit for the union which is likely why they typically don't become member-only groups because they would then forfeit monopoly rights, even though that would completely avoid the free-rider problem.
@our45thPOTUS @AFSCME @Right2Work Two points. It's your opinion that Democratic policies are better for workers. Clearly not every worker agrees with you. Some do, some don't. And no, unions become the exclusive representative for all workers in a bargaining unit even if some are nonmembers.
@our45thPOTUS @AFSCME @Right2Work That is something a lot of right-to-work advocates want. Then nonunion workers would be free to negotiate their own deals. Unions typically oppose this because they lose monopoly rights. Unions actually could form member-only groups if free-riders are a concern.

I have an idea for a movie. Night at the Museum 4, but the museum is full of Confederate statues because they were removed.
@local1025 @ceidotorg Here's my email anyways. Connor@insidesources.com. You never know. Or at least let me know if you're ever in D.C. We'll grab a beer.
@local1025 @ceidotorg That's horrible to hear and sadly a common story. If I can help the Local 1025 folks by giving them a voice, I am happy to.
I am very concerned with how emboldened racists have become. But I am also concerned with people responding with calls for violence.

@bernabephoto checking out your website. Your photos are incredible.
@BenClarkPhD That's a valid argument against the president. But not my premise here. Changing the argument is not a great way to disprove me.
@brittgervais18 @Too_Big_To_Fail Saying he should have been more harsh towards the alt-right is valid. Blaming him for the rally is not. Two different arguments.
@BenClarkPhD Saying he should have been more harsh towards the alt-right is valid. Blaming him for the rally is not. Two different arguments.
@equus_a But let's be honest. That's too easy. Literal actions are much easier to prove compared to speculations of intent. But that's my premise.
@equus_a A little but it's still good advice. My evidence is he literally never endorsed this rally. Your turn handsome.
@equus_a Let me see if I can help you. You have a premise with anecdotal support. Not enough to make a claim but a good start. Now find evidence.
@equus_a Precisely, I can't answer it because it is leading. It was a bad question. So I stated a response instead.
@equus_a Well firstly I would reject the question as it is leading. But I wouldn't call it an endorsement of a rally intended to incite racism.
@AprilFoolsRebel Well if he truly did it probably wouldn't have been necessary to add the qualifier before approval.
@equus_a Not hard to understand. But that's not my premise. Changing my argument is not a great way to disprove me. That's a logical fallacy.
@AprilFoolsRebel There is a maybe so long as you're speculating intent and belief without evidence.
@Too_Big_To_Fail I certainly agree he has attracted loads of questionable supporter. But that alone is not enough evidence to say he supports them back.
@AprilFoolsRebel Nor did he endorse them. Maybe he should have been more harsh to the alt-right side but that's hardly an endorsement.
@ChrisMHerbst Oh not mad at all. Just reminding everyone how important logical discourse is when dealing with politics. But thank you for asking!!!!!
@AprilFoolsRebel I don't have to pretend because silence literally doesn't automatically mean approval. Maybe it does but without evidence it's speculation.
@Too_Big_To_Fail A person doesn't embody a belief solely because people with that belief support them. That's a ridiculous concept.
@judeeflick Maybe. But I won't say 'most' unless I have data to backup the claim. But that my personal ethics as a journalist.
@Too_Big_To_Fail Illogical argument. Both sides of the aisle receive support from questionable and bad people. Next.
There are some people so desperate to attack Trump they are blaming him for a violent racist rally he didn't endorse or have involvement in.

@KBronfenbrenner but I have to imagine some supporters of the law actually believe in worker chose and aren't trying to destroy unions.
@KBronfenbrenner perhaps RTW supporters should also advocate for better federal labor law so chose works both ways. Would be interesting.
@KBronfenbrenner that is a solid point. Obviously preventing an employee from joining a union is wrong. Violates the rights of association.
@bobgiolito @KBronfenbrenner thank you. I got you now. But the argument is not workers shouldn't have unions. Their argument is about chose.
@KBronfenbrenner I don't know what only penalty a posting means. Also, where might I see your research? Always looking for more literature.

@Arteltoe indeed open borders do have some fundamental flaws. But you did assume I held a position which reflects a flaw in your argument.
@Arteltoe that's interesting. I would recommend improving your argument so you don't have to rely on logical fallacies. Thanks.
@Arteltoe I never said I support open borders. That's a strawman argument which, of course, is a logical fallacy.
@Arteltoe blaming the current labor market issues on immigrants ignores the actual issue.
@jwmac57 @SalenaZito I assume good. I'm a nice guy. I think...
@Arteltoe that assumes a surplus in underemployment and a lack of high-skilled jobs. Which, to be fair, is the current problem.

@Daryl16519C nope. Legit question. I'm interested in what people think.
@westpatravel true but should they. Does the Constitution justify that interpretation?

@PCGhoul true. Makes it more interesting hanging with him on the off chance he is indeed the Lone Wanderer.
@PCGhoul I think it's safe to say we can't really trust anything he says leaving the possibility he never reveals his true backstory.
@PCGhoul Deacon claims to be a Synth but its never confirmed. Its likely untrue considering he gives multiple back stories.
@aguinn @camanpour there are a lot of great journalists in the media. I think it's more an issue of bad apples making everyone look bad.
I just heard a wild #Fallout4 fan theory that makes some sense. That being Deacon is actually the Lone Wanderer. What'd ya'll think?
@_peppercats @camanpour there are many outstanding journalists at @CNN. Sadly not everyone is. That goes for other outlets and papers too.
It's very concerning when influential journalists like @camanpour say their version of the truth outweighs reporting ethics.

@robertpechersky that's a great success but doesn't answer my question. That success already happened. Dwelling on it is asking for failure.
@777ChannelNews that's a good idea but it doesn't even address my question in the slightest.
@sdan005 that's likely but in the end it depends on him. His ability to transition that message into popular action is what matters.
@FredSrock also its important to note that a populist message doesn't have to be the popular ideal though it certainly helps.
@FredSrock yes. Many populist movements have become incumbents and thus had to fight newer populist movements.
@sdan005 no, this has nothing to do with the demonstrations. This is an issue many previous populist movements have had to face.
@eod_navy not yet but outside a huge upset he is going to be the most power man in the world soon. Honesty definitely has huge merits here.
@FredSrock but because populism is about challenging the establishment class it becomes more of an issue. That's my point.
@eod_navy but here he has already become the establishment. He has become an elite and thus his message won't be populist soon.
Populist movements tend to be short lived. They either fail or undermine themselves by becoming the establishment. How can Trump avoid this?
@1mrreason mine as well. I always appreciated the equal opportunity offender approach to comedy.

Donald Trump didn't win because of bigotry or racism. He won because he offered to help people who are struggling and being ignored.
@Nole4life02 maybe but if they did I would have written the exact same thing for them too. These rights are sacred among all us countrymen.
@Nole4life02 if they are acting violently then no. I clearly called for nonviolence. Peaceful Trump supporters also get my support.
@Dustin88P I'm not propping anyone up. I'm clearly encouraging them to exercise their constitutional rights with nonviolence.
@Dustin88P I'm merely noting their constitutional rights. But I respect your right to oppose to U.S. Constitution as well.

@Dustin88P you assume a lot Dustin. I never said I was a Clinton supporter. Here I am clearly supporting constitutional rights.

@Gr8JohnQPublic you said it yourself. The few and not the many. Those few should be confronted by law enforcement.
@Gr8JohnQPublic you clearly missed my call for nonviolence. In was in the very post you commented on. Pay attention my friend.
@Gr8JohnQPublic they can protest because we have a constitution based on classical liberal ideals. The same reason you can call them losers.

@vbspurs I consider it an important chapter in my life. It was a great experience for me as a young man who was passionate politically.

@Roger247 my comment is clearly not aimed at the violent demonstrators. It is referring to those out there acting properly.
@Gr8JohnQPublic for those who are violent yes but there are still protesters out there exercising their rights properly. That is who I mean.

@Sea_Bucklin I never said unions were constitutional or not. I said the right to join one or not is.
@Sea_Bucklin if you say a worker cannot join a union, that violates their rights. I just happen to believe in the U.S. Constitution.
@Sea_Bucklin abolishing an organization does actually. The right to assemble. Forcing people to assemble also violates there rights.
@Sea_Bucklin that is only true in 25 states. RTW ends compulsory union dues. Abolishing unions goes much further and ends a right.
@Sea_Bucklin abolishing unions would violate the constitutional right to assemble though. Shouldn't we help guarantee individual rights?
@DeanMI there is actually little evidence of a right-to-work wage gap once you adjust for cost of living in separate states. Thanks.

@Thrifty_Blogger @DailyCaller @kaitlancollins true but one man's tasteless joke is another man's catalyst to positive change.
@chaireverie history shows people are far more likely to face harsh realities with humor. Soapboxes often serve the talker, not the victims.
@chaireverie Twain has been credited in helping to turn opinions against slavery. Is the goal to stand on a soapbox or make positive change?
@chaireverie personally I prefer topical satire. Mark Twain was criticized for poking fun of slavery. Now his works are classic.
@DarakNy @DailyCaller @kaitlancollins no need for violence my friend. Satire is the language of intellects so its okay if you don't get it.
