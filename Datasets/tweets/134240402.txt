@RepDeanPhillips @POTUS Will you co-sponsor &amp; urge the congress and your leadership to also pass HR1044 - Fairness of High Skilled Immigrants Act. That bill is also for fairness and more than 15k of your constituents are directly affected by this.
@Ataru074 @Saurav9351 @RepDeanPhillips And looks like you have prejudice about certain ppl from certain countries while the bill is only talking about fairness for everyone. And you need to concentrate on facts than rhetorics
@Ataru074 @RepDeanPhillips As you shared the picture, please check yourself. Thank you.
@Ataru074 @RepDeanPhillips You need to go back and check what constituents mean. Also by your logic you are saying a kid born in america, less than 18, residing in #MN03 is not a constituent of @RepDeanPhillips . Now i am interested to know if @RepDeanPhillips feels the same.
@RepDeanPhillips There are other people in your constituency who also seek fairness and they are law abiding high skilled immigrants who seeks your co-sponsorship for HR1044. Will consider co-sponsoring the fairness legislation like you did for other community?

@jamawill @KevinYoder He expressed his concerns and anguish to DHS Secy. He said that he want it to end. He spoke about it various times publicly. He spoke with President. He did everything he can within his limited abilities mam.

So lets start dreaming of a clean city and London in India.	To kyu kolkatta wasi "banna chahte ho duniya k sabse pyara, neat & clean city?"
So the learned people of the city, caste your vote in favour of TMC candidates to realise & fulfil your long cherished dream.
But its bcoz of Buddha & Biman's corruption & lack of foresightness we are behind.
Our kolkata can be London, North Bengal can be a tourist destination for foreigners just like switzerland.
