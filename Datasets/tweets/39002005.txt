@yanquetino @SenSanders @docdanielle An average of about $28.5 million per CEO and a median of about $17.3 million per CEO.

@yanquetino @SenSanders @docdanielle Better healthcare? Instead of treating symptoms you may actually get the problem addressed. Imagine getting help and care to address a problem verses a lifetime prescription and appointments. Because curing someone does not pay insurance, pharmaceutical companies or doctors.
@danhalbert12341 @JessieFlagg1 @SenSanders @docdanielle I would hardly call single payer healthcare and two years of college as part of primary education free. Yes, we all pay and we all benefit.

@JessieFlagg1 @danhalbert12341 @SenSanders @docdanielle It‚Äôs also because of deep pockets and RICH CEOs of Insurance companies, Companies wielding political power. Big insurance and pharmaceutical companies do not want to let that go. If everyone gets equal care, good care and reasonable care, they lose money and power. People second.
@SenSanders @docdanielle Yes, we will not be able to run that test until you go through this list of other tests and treatments. It can take months of scheduling appointments and going through treatments to meet insurance requirements before you get the care you need.

@monicagrimaldo_ I recently went through a three week course about self awareness, awareness of others, teams, leaders. Self empowerment. üôè
@monicagrimaldo_ write the codes in their performance report cards and grade them.
@monicagrimaldo_ there's more buy in if the school creates code collectively and agrees. All students take a pledge to follow code created.
@monicagrimaldo_ then decide how to reward successful behaviors.
@monicagrimaldo_ success (3) would be: respectful to peers, encourages others, a good example to follow when communicating with others.
@monicagrimaldo_ medium (2) some form of not using respectful communication with school peers. But not extreme rudeness.
@monicagrimaldo_ failure/unacceptable  (1) would be name calling, bad mouthing and insulting your school peers.
@monicagrimaldo_ then, make a rubric with how the three codes can be measured. For instance: #1. no name calling, insults, bad mouthing.
@monicagrimaldo_ capture all ideas. Then group the ideas together into three statements that make up the code of conduct.
@monicagrimaldo_ someone writes down how you treat others by students raising their hands, sharing out loud how they respect/protect/treat.
@monicagrimaldo_ have students define code of conduct themselves at a town hall. They come up with ideas for conduct collectively.
