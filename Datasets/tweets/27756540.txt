There was some reporting last week that Ted Cruz was privately opposing Kavanaugh. 		But in statement tonight: "By any measure, Judge Kavanaugh is one of the most respected federal judges in the country and I look forward to supporting his nomination."
Dem Sen. Tom Carper (supported Kavanaugh for DC circuit): 		"Senate must hold Judge Kavanaugh accountable for his deeply concerning record over the past 12 years on the bench. ...His substantial record over that time period has proven to be a profound disappointment."
Me: Do you know the nominee's name?		My dad: "Britt K-Kapp-Kappali-starts with a K."		(But he does know Senate GOP just need simple majority.)
