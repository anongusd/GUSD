@Flutterflash @ggqt3 @McDonalds They can upgrade the charges but at booking, that was enough to hold him.
@AngelaBWhite1 @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds I guarantee his impairment (most likely alcohol and drugs) escalated his irrational reaction.  And she, fortunately, was able to defend herself.  He then assaulted 2 others.
@Ford89234211 @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds And you replied without unrolling the entire thread.  Out of context, I can see where you based your thoughts.  Witness reported he began screaming before approaching the counter.  It was escalating, rapidly.  He had no right to touch her.
@EleanorOfAquit6 @ctbballfan @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds You really should get that stick out of your ass.  It‚Äôs gotta hurt.
@acturagenoturs_ @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds I agree but he was definitely impaired in some way.  In his mugshot his eyes are dilated which is usually consistent w substance abuse.  Over a straw.  It‚Äôs mind boggling.
@NotThatType_Dr @thisisnotr0z3 @babaWAsherlin @tariqnasheed He tells the manager he wants his food, so he looks at the ticket and walks out of frame.  Customers had already called 911.  He walked away, then came back and attacked the manager while they waited for PD to arrive.
@lanafur Wrong thread, sorry! That was part of a broader conversation that was more about dealing with people who are mentally ill or impaired. He was definitely impaired.  Stable people don‚Äôt go so crazy over a straw.  She‚ÄôsüíØ justified in defending herself. 2 addition ppl were attacked.

@Ford89234211 @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds I did not imply that.  You assumed that.  I live near a halfway house for mentally ill people, I see them everyday and quite often befriend them.  I also deal with people under the influence of drugs and hooch every day of my life.Normal, stable people don‚Äôt lose it over a straw.
@Nunya_bzznass @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds Clearly you don‚Äôt understand de-escalating a situation.  She had every right to defend herself, which she did quite well.  This episode continued where he attacked the manager and another employee as well.  He was clearly impaired.  His mugshot screams crackhead.
@acturagenoturs_ @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds No one is justifying his actions.  He is in jail and attacked two more people.
@EleanorOfAquit6 @PaulDSmith9 @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds He attacked the Manager too.
@AuntieKarla @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds Also, I didn‚Äôt imply, you assumed.  And we know what happens when people assume.
@AuntieKarla @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds I specifically said ‚ÄúI concur.  However,when dealing with mentally unstable people, the goal is to manage the risk of further public danger‚Äù.   Don‚Äôt use quotes if you don‚Äôt know how.
@EleanorOfAquit6 @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds I do not disagree with you.  Does a normal, unimpaired person usually resort to assault when requesting additional drinking straws?
@EleanorOfAquit6 @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds But I agree, he was definitely impaired.  It was the day after his big 40 and he got beat up by a small woman at McDonalds, arrested and charged with multiple counts of battery for attacking others.  Mugshot looks like meth head. I concur.
@EleanorOfAquit6 @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds And by the way, it was battery.
@EleanorOfAquit6 @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds Who exactly is giving him a pass?  He committed a series of crimes and as a result is now in jail, rightfully so.
@ctbballfan @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds Nice language Gramps. All employees do receive customer service training and how to avoid conflict.  I don‚Äôt think any reasonable person could have seen a reaction that crazy to a drinking straw request.  She certainly was better prepared to handle him than most, for sure.
@OCLonghorn @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds And he is overdrawn at the commissary at Pinellas County jail.....
@bdonahueweedman @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds No one said that.  #capslockchill
@tamjak @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds Well, I don‚Äôt know where you live but where I live, stable people don‚Äôt go batshitcrazy and batter multiple folks for a drinking straw.
@TheBrofucius @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds I never heard anything about race.  He is an equal opportunity batterer as he attacked the Manager and another employee.
@JALady36 @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds I specifically said either mentally ill/otherwise impaired, which if in his mugshot, you can see glassed over, dialated pupils indicative signs of substance abuse. Normal people to not unhinge and become aggressive and violent when requesting drinking straws.
@AuntieKarla @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds I certainly don‚Äôt question anyone‚Äôs actions, except Daniel Willis Taylor‚Äôs.
@antitrumpresist @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds If you read his intake sheet, it seems he has been stabbed before (scar on ribs).  He attacked two others too.  She was üíØjustified, not to mention his head is probably still throbbing.
@TallGirl6262 @tariqnasheed That tat tho
@TallGirl6262 @tariqnasheed Rib, appendix, lesbian symbol.   Probably has been stabbed.
@LeishaFoyDooley @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds @mcdonald Also Manager was attacked as was another employee.  Charges are likely to be upgraded.
@LeishaFoyDooley @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds @mcdonald https://t.co/bdWr77BcZs. Please cite your sources regarding firing.   McDonald‚Äôs statement regarding incident says otherwise.
@AngelaBWhite1 @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds In what society is it ‚Äúnormal‚Äù to batter  multiple people over a straw?  She was actually ‚Äúbattered‚Äù as were others, of other races.  He is an equal opportunity bully.  He is also criminal and most likely an addict.  Congratulations on all your educationüçæüìöüìì!

@Dougbranch6 @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds I agree üíØ.  But a stable person doesn‚Äôt lose their mind over a straw.  Now he‚Äôs in jail.
@ItllBeAiight @the79show @AuntieKarla @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds One is not like the other.   He attacked the white, male manager.  There were many911 calls on this incident and you saw less than 1 minute of a much longer incident.  A stable person doesn‚Äôt get Batshit nuts over a straw, regardless of race.

@patrickesnyder @PassTheSalty @McDonalds Where exactly did this become about race? It was a straw issue.   I only heard him call her a bitch. After she defended herself vigorously and valiantly.  He‚Äôs the only bitch I heard.  Day after 40th, homeless, crazy, ass kicked by a woman and in jail.  #patheticexcuseforaman
@StarredBannet @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds So you need to make this about race? Let‚Äôs go with human than, shall we? Wrong is wrong.  His actions are indefensible, regardless.  Hers, admirable, again, regardless. No one had the right to touch her.
@justicedawning @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds Manager‚Äôs manage.  Thats why they are called Managers.  They manage employees, situations  and also train staff how to respond to potential contentious situations.

@WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds Sir, he is a homeless transient, being held for provisional extradition.  His behavior is indicative of a meth head.   No one goes that crazy over a straw.   McDonald‚Äôs is pretty generous with their straws.  I have 50 in my car.
@kdivies1 @PassTheSalty @McDonalds She took the order in front of him. It was paid for.  Then he went apeshit over a straw then he battered her.

@justicedawning @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds No one is arguing that she had every right to defend herself.  He had no right to touch her, under any circumstances so don‚Äôt @ me on this.   My concern is for her and her alone.
@WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds I concur.  However,when dealing with mentally unstable people, the goal is to manage the risk of further public danger.

Those employees count on those jobs to feed their families, closing would hurt more people  than the original battery victim.

@CharacterMatte @JoEbi21 @ggqt3 1 individual was charged +convicted w misdemeanor in 2015.  What was it for specifically?  Is it def related? 	Does @chipotle have pay before prep policy or was it only to these individuals?  They prep my food, miserly, I might add, w/out oprepayment before I quit patronizing.
@JoEbi21 @CharacterMatte @ggqt3 Thank god for your mad detective skills, still doesn‚Äôt change fact the employees took matters into their own hands.  Do I agree w them crying wolf?  No. Seems he was arrested and went thru the legal system.  If they‚Äôre stupid enough to do it again they deserve proscecution.
@JoEbi21 @CharacterMatte @ggqt3 Haven‚Äôt had opportunity to do a thorough background check on all parties, however, @Chipotle doesn‚Äôt have a ‚Äúpay before your order is made‚Äù policy.  If they did, I would refuse cuz skimpy protein portions. Employees escalated. If they didn‚Äôt pay, there are legal ramifications.

@CindyinSmoke @blueyedproducer @ian_mcmeanan @PractialMagic @SophiaPicIt @norgedane @JerryBrownGov @GavinNewsom @POTUS So my number, 60 since May is actually spot on.  A legal background does wonders for presenting facts.

@blueyedproducer @ian_mcmeanan @PractialMagic @SophiaPicIt @norgedane @JerryBrownGov @GavinNewsom @POTUS For sake of debate clarify: 8,000 indictments x 7.60 month = 60,800.
