@TheRev1953 SBP is a voluntary insurance policy at retirement (monthly premiums paid) and automatically given to active duty at no cost while active duty. After retirement they are given a choice to continue to pay premiums. Ex‚Äôs can demand SBP in divorce decree.
@TheRev1953 #2. All the ex-spouses have to do is demand it in the divorce decree. In some cases if not in divorce decree the ex-spouse has to sign off on it for SBP to go to the widow. This offset is discriminating to nearly all widows/ers!
@TheRev1953 Yes, when there is a divorce the ex-spouse, if married long enough while service member is active duty can demand SBP to go to them if there‚Äôs a divorce. I‚Äôve seen this happen many times during a divorce. Google SBP and divorce. No offset on SBP. #WidowsTax
