@jenniferm_q @MarkPatient @TRHLofficial That’s a higher number than I would have guessed...😳		Which certainly leads back to the cavalier-ness of the decision to abort.
@jenniferm_q @TRHLofficial Perhaps. But in today’s world, it’s amazing what Google, YT, and Amazon can provide. I would argue that access to information and contraception is greater than ever before.
@usminority @AOC https://t.co/OpGJbnEReo
@jenniferm_q @MarkPatient @TRHLofficial Do you think the higher the number of abortions a woman has, the more cavalier the decision? If it’s so difficult a decision, one would think a women would make sure not to put herself in that position again.
@jenniferm_q @TRHLofficial Unwanted pregnancies are the result of a lack of personal responsibility. All the posturing about lack of sex ed is horse crap. All the posturing about lack of contraception is horse crap, too.	Make responsible choices = decease unwanted pregnancies.

@AdyBarkan Your story is interesting. But what you fail to recognize is that you chose to take the money and publish a position that wasn’t your own. That’s on you, not AIPAC. Don’t point the finger and decry lobbyists when you were a part of the problem.

@adamscrabble I agree. But it’s never been this “forward” or as mainstream. “Free college for all” was a Bernie thing. Not necessarily an original idea, but it gained traction. And it has blossomed from there.
@adamscrabble True, but now his movement and influence has brought the likes of AOC and socialist agendas into the mainstream Dem platform.
Yup. https://t.co/J8AYoEpX7i
@MarkDice @AOC If the original document wasn’t so ridiculous these satirical ones would clearly be satirical. #GreenNewDeal #GreenNewDisaster
@adamscrabble I think the Dems will sink her. She refuses to lock step and is a threat to their agenda. Just like they did to Bernie.
It’s mind-boggling that the Left think @rch371 was “victorious” on @TuckerCarlson. He lied. Outright lied. It was akin to watching a parent catch their toddler with a cookie in hand amid broken pieces of a jar and the toddler denying responsibility.
