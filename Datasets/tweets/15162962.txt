At that time the left were attributing that shooting to the "right wing" rhetoric. https://t.co/wdp6i5dy69

@PitbullCorrect To be clear your position is Newtown shooting did happen but it was a staged event with actors. Got it.
@PitbullCorrect You said Newtown shooting was a staged event with actors. Therefore no real shooting took place. Right?

False flags don't apply to actual events. Please. As for "pics" well, why dance around it, just proclaim Newtown didn't happen either? https://t.co/hh5AfUv4jr

@vjeannek @pboese @davidaxelrod @Auriandra Good job, I missed that. Why isn't this bigger news?
@pboese @davidaxelrod @Auriandra So I don't get an answer? If Russia helped Trump, would it be possible if Hillary weren't corrupt? Answer that
@pboese @davidaxelrod @Auriandra Right, evidently. The whole scenario makes no sense. If Russians had stuff on Hillary, then why not let her win?
@pboese @davidaxelrod @Auriandra Baseless. It's not even a logical scandal
@pboese @davidaxelrod @Auriandra No evidence. It's a political event
@Dasani_01 Why would the investigation not continue, if there even is one?
@Dasani_01 When the evidence? There is none, why do you believe in something that isn't there? By hoping it is?

@Dasani_01 I was a Cruz guy. But he's much more fun. But 38mil is a lot of money for taxes
@cody_k too early. The only stat we need to see is GDP, if it performs over 3, Dems troubles go into survival mode.
Theater https://t.co/A49T0ZeEba
I take that as a concession that job market stinks since it's an "issue" that won't "improve". Why does it need to after 8 years, hmmm? https://t.co/lTWuLvvSun
@Dasani_01 Well, can't say I'm jealous.
@cody_k .....rejected wholesale
Regardless, Dem party has been rejected in large numbers, it's up to GOP now to fix things, they may not, but Dems and Obama policies are... https://t.co/cAZTXIWdFO
No, 10% of the population, we've been through this before. Too many, too short a time https://t.co/U8KT8GZ5lP
@Dasani_01 how so?
@Dasani_01 I may or may not. He produces more economic activity, more revenue
@Dasani_01 yes, I believe he triggered a minimum tax rate that affects his bracket
No no, 30 million less people in work force. Those are real numbers (BLS). Why are there prem hikes to begin with when BO promised reductns? https://t.co/1lnbvI5CY4
@Dasani_01 no, I pay 28%.
@Dasani_01 don't mean to razz, your my fav still
@cody_k ....deductibles absurdly high, choices shrinking. It's a bad bill. If I were a Dem I would say it's a bad plan
CBO or not, we start to argue definitions etc. when companies lay off scores of full time workers for part time; premiums tru the roof..... https://t.co/diFllt241D
@Dasani_01 no, 38 million to 150 million is 40% no?
@cody_k how can they ever be wrong if there is a wide range?
@cody_k .....but it's a fact
One idea is important now, Obamacare. From its passing Dems lost congress WH govrns seats legistrs. Maybe it's a spurious correlation.... https://t.co/zLPP6VLYnx
@BuffyBlogs @cody_k poor Buff, at least your good spirited. Dems are decimated nearly everywhere because of Obamacare.
CBO was way off in scoring Ocare enrollment. Not just Ocare but they are asked to predict complex what ifs, unrealistic seldom accurate https://t.co/2ukxgjN9lj
@cody_k my quote
@BuffyBlogs @cody_k no, resort to election results the last 7 years. Regressive enough?
All of a sudden classified info triggers espionage act? It didn't before with Hillary? Come on Chris, drop the journalist act https://t.co/rsh4V52j2J
@cody_k @BuffyBlogs no bill covers everyone. There's one constant: Obamacare is terrible and won't survive whether it's repealed or not
@breton_anne daydream or not, current system destroyed Dem party so don't think things are fine and dandy
@cody_k no, step one isn't votes in the senate, that would be far down the road. This is house Bill, then senate then reconciliation, no?
@cody_k it's a start, not the final product. Never cared for cbo numbers, static scoring etc. Current systm is reason 4 Dem loses everywhere
@cody_k sorry, thought you were on tax reform
@cody_k @Amy_Siskind I've yet to see a proposal. It will be criticized through a class prism by the left. You guys need a new game
@laurie_wagner that's original, is that your own observation?
@TrumpTrashBags @Amy_Siskind @cody_k tax structure needs reform. standard characterization of tax cuts "for the rich" is old and stale
@laurie_wagner yea okay, but the current system destroyed your party.

@suetsam @peterdaou @Rocky1542 if you think it's ok to go after his religion or lack of it to whom does this appeal to?
Actually is was MSNBC moderators in the debate that asked her that. https://t.co/2mzXlUtIo2
If it weren't true, then why did so many believe it? Btw, exactly how did she ever earn $100's of millions. Maybe Bernie had a point. https://t.co/Dc4BOKP6O4

@suetsam @peterdaou @Rocky1542 how did he do her harm?By running against her? was she supposed 2run unopposed? Is it evey1's fault she lost?

@tstroud751 @No_More_PC_2Day I'm a conservative, certainly it wouldn't. But Jill cannot have been a factor. If she was, that's still in Hill
@tstroud751 @No_More_PC_2Day @peterdaou @Rocky1542 well, no, that's not what his appeal was regardless if he believes what you just said
@No_More_PC_2Day @tstroud751 the big difference between Hillary supporters and Bernie, the former was for a person, the latter, idea
@paisleyhearts81 I've had my fill of the word "narrative"
@tstroud751 @No_More_PC_2Day @peterdaou @Rocky1542 they all do, she was negative when she was winning
@tstroud751 @No_More_PC_2Day if not for her dam emails we're down to just Trump. Please, don't include Stein
@tstroud751 @No_More_PC_2Day just happy Hillary lost
@tstroud751 @No_More_PC_2Day @peterdaou @Rocky1542 if he hurt her candidacy, why not say it?
@paisleyhearts81 but she lost to Trump in rust belt states she lost to Bernie
@tstroud751 @No_More_PC_2Day @peterdaou @Rocky1542 sure, she didn't need help but when she loses Bernie is the bad guy. Come on
@paisleyhearts81  No, he energized true believers that had a voice. She did not resonate with them, that's on her
@tstroud751 @No_More_PC_2Day @peterdaou @Rocky1542 she would have won to be sure, but to say Bernie hurt her candidacy, please, SHE lost it

@peterdaou @Rocky1542 oh, she's so pure and good. It's called a election, these things happen. Now he's to blame?
@peterdaou @Rocky1542 what harm? He energized young voters. Also a victim of DNC/Hillary/CNN collusion. Hillary lost but he's the bad guy

@TheFreshBrew fine, unfortunately for your side everyone is in agreement. Don't see any victories from it. Nominate another Hillary
@TheFreshBrew come on, you understand

It's still being counted, but let's say Hillary wins. Electoral vote is a far better system https://t.co/l87fPjclFu
@TheFreshBrew @HillaryClinton ...in that, the electoral college is a smart system. Why should rust belt states not have a say?
@TheFreshBrew @HillaryClinton if you are struggling while living in the rust belt do you think help is in the way with "green jobs"?
@TheFreshBrew ....otherwise Hillary was a great candidate
@TheFreshBrew I had this debate before. There is nothing to suggest that, nothing
@TheFreshBrew don't you agree?

@RobLowe ...that's baseball
@RobLowe why?
@LisaLoeb @LisaBloom @RealJamesWoods you fell for that?
@RealMikeWilbon ...don't be Cubby, not every decision is a curse, relax

@straysneedlove  too many cats. Humane to exterminate
@JonahNRO someone tweeted about kittens, used the same line. This reprobate thing, it's aces!

@BillMcCully don't make me retract my apology. I admit I don't like dogs, I think they're animals

@LKrauss1 @ddiamond don't worry, moral character is nothing but a bunch of swirling molecules anyway
@piersmorgan the other side has still to accept election of 2000
@Trumpnado2016 @Rosie @Deadline https://t.co/LgQ0NoxI9a
@morgfair @washingtonpost ....by exposing Hillary shenanigans?
@keepawake2 @JonahNRO oh boy, read it for sure; skip over the sacrifices though
@DiannaDtgcats @glennbeck "standing aginst Trump &amp;4 princples is indeed the election of Hillary,so b it.At least its a moral,ethical choice"
@candicevega @glennbeck truth about what, telling a Hillary supporter to retire?
@JonahNRO @SandiFitchHutt alright don't have a bird I did apologize.....now go get your shine box
@iamcam55 @JonahNRO you proved it
@NatGeoChannel @RealRonHoward @NatGeo all life is just that, life
@HarveyLevinTMZ @TMZ none of our business
@705Tracy @JonahNRO why hair? Oh, know what you mean
@iamcam55 @JonahNRO so profound
@Opus2360 @JonahNRO I'm not married and I can't understand why
@SandiFitchHutt @JonahNRO wasn't meant to be. It's a humane yet insensitive response
@FractiousUSA @JonahNRO ridiculous. That's a liberalesque response in that I'm mean therefore my politics is opposite to yours
@JonahNRO alright alright I apologize but animals aren't meant to suffer. But a dingo in an apartment. Come on
@cbags74 @JonahNRO its mean when the pet suffers, goes through surgery, pills etc
@JimboDKearney @JonahNRO I don't keep score
@705Tracy @JonahNRO I like Jonah's politics, just don't let animals suffer
@Dipstick4u @waltmossberg @MarkRuffalo oh, okay. If you say so
@Fahrenthold @morgfair @realDonaldTrump hope he didn't accept Saudi money too.
@GOP_U @waltmossberg @MarkRuffalo in other words he had a right to not accept the results. Oh big difference, thanks
@SarahKSilverman go back to being "funny"
@jasoncherkis @HillaryClinton not when news people fund her they won't
@annalecta @morgfair @KFILE Hillary voted for it, what now?
@katiecouric @donnabrazile @YahooNews even better when she helped rig the other ones?
@USATODAY @RealRonHoward such authority
@MarkRuffalo @bridgetbhc When Gore did it certainly Mark you were so outraged? Actually you weren't
@EllenBarkin killing a baby, that's what it entails
@mmfa @JVM they were all for it with Al Gore though
@NBCNews @JVM does Chelsea still work for you?
@waltmossberg @MarkRuffalo what about when Gore did it?
@RawStory @morgfair Gore didn't and he became a liberal darling. A fraud to normal people
@michaelianblack @Alyssa_Milano you forgot he put down crooked Hillary
@KirstenPowers well, it's CNN after all
@MaksimC @realDonaldTrump @BeckyR2125 @wits_mcgee she's right, stick to dancing
@EllenBarkin or just ask a doctor, ever think of that?
@JeffFlake @morgfair @realDonaldTrump Gore didn't
@JonahNRO put it to sleep
@katiecouric Katie, your so impartial, kind of like the rest of your compadres. Well done
@GregoryGAllen @Rosie is there anyone she won't take money from? No shame? Principles?
@glennbeck retire
@sbg1 @RealRonHoward no, he did condemn it. What those hacks reveal, try condemning that
@Julie_Echo @secupp @NYDailyNews no, Divisive govt is a good thing. Makes it difficult to pass laws which are antithetical to freedom
@Julie_Echo ....and the onus is on the right to compromise not the other way around
@Julie_Echo @secupp @NYDailyNews no, not anxious to see cooperation. I want stagnation. It means less laws.
@jaketapper @morgfair fair enough Jake
@stephenasmith @Cubs Cubs got to stop thinking they're Cubs in the post season
Or if they are just Cubs https://t.co/aTtjVE7qcl

@dylanlscott @morgfair @statnews absurd
@nprscottsimon @Cubs they must be liberals
@NancyLeeGrahn oh boy, your really doing him damage. Who are you exactly?
@morgfair @nytimes how much can he really have, he's in real estate. Give it up
@washingtonpost @Alyssa_Milano experts in what exactly?
@tavissmiley @POTUS @GOP @TIME wrong! Or perhaps you can cite the constitution and prove me wrong
@KirstenPowers @thedailybeast glad to know you recognize the absurdity. Curiously only when it's copied. Why is that?
@JonahHill wow Jonah, you're getto
@katiecouric @TheEconomist Not politics, it's the debasing of the media that perpetuates debasing of politics, know what I mean, Katie?
@girlsreallyrule @sharonstone she's corrupt
@Julie_Echo @secupp @NYDailyNews SE is so enamored with the idea that the right has to show they are swell people after all. No!
@Julie_Echo @secupp @NYDailyNews true, but liberal characterizations of conservatism must be jettisoned first, then we can talk
So the left launches one ad hominem after another and what, the right is supposed to say sorry? Where is there room? https://t.co/NUgRiP4oWq
@NancyLeeGrahn there goes Obama's non plans
@RealMikeWilbon maybe it's the uniform. Too cognizant of being "Cubs"
@akhanukov @secupp @NYDailyNews meant "so" I can't answer
@akhanukov @secupp @NYDailyNews I don't share Hillary's language do I can't answer
@akhanukov @secupp @NYDailyNews metaphor, though clever, doesn't fit
@akhanukov @secupp @NYDailyNews ....that's not compromise, that's capitulation
@akhanukov @secupp @NYDailyNews aww, such a nice thought. But on who's terms, theirs? The onus of the right is to prove their not awful?
@NateT_ @secupp no nathan, in her article she is concerned about liberal criticism. Trump is an impediment to assuage them, I ask why bother
@iafollatim @secupp regardless, your being generous. Say it, it is the ideology. Stick to your guns, I won't bite
@NateT_ @secupp @NYDailyNews I'm not a Trump guy but the question for SE stands in general. Btw, criticisms are not all valid
@misguidedangel9 @secupp @NYDailyNews oh of course, all Gop is this ism and that ism, even the best of them. Please
@CarsonCityKid @secupp @NYDailyNews  I suspect that is correct
@akhanukov @secupp @NYDailyNews choose country over party, correct. Hillary is and has always been corrupt
@akhanukov @secupp @NYDailyNews fine, but the right should go out of their way to gain their favor. Lost cause
You mean worse than Obama policies, or does that rise in poverty count? https://t.co/NZfISgsZvR

@secupp @NYDailyNews ....SE, why give credence to the criticisms of the left?
@KirstenPowers @CatholicLisa ....why parse paragraphs?
@KirstenPowers @CatholicLisa forget what bishops say. If abortion exterminated human life, why put in power people who want it to continue?
@MagicJohnson @ArsenioHall @Dodgers a Yankee owner would never feel a need to post that
@secupp @NYDailyNews conservatives or any GOP are accused of awful things regardless of candidate.

@BarackObama @OFA gee, ever consider why blocking what you want is a "gain"?
@secupp  why not publish it? It reveals information we ought to know, no?

@lucy87723923 if not the cause then the tools to deliver someone out of it. Yes, no?
@lucy87723923 insofar as, when you said, deploying will power towards that end, which you say you did, correct?
@MTV @justinbieber he needs a hobby
@lucy87723923  no, sickness comes to people
@lucy87723923 @Marina_Sirtis @TrekFanLV   Wasn't judgement involved?
Like switching seats on the titanic https://t.co/xTaEwHYaox
@AmboClaire yes, will power
@lucy87723923 @Marina_Sirtis @TrekFanLV That's not the fault of will power, that was a judgement as to where to apply it, no?
I detect that the concept seems to strike a nerve. Will power is irrelevant, not essential. But if it were to prevail..... https://t.co/b5DkzBizt8
@Marina_Sirtis @TrekFanLV precisely why I'm asking for clarity, I don't understand. Thanks, always a fan :)
@Marina_Sirtis @TrekFanLV If the loss of will power makes one feel useless, doesn't that validate the importance of will power?
@Marina_Sirtis But you don't disagree with @TrekFanLV that will power is essential, no?
@JVM in other words a nonsense gathering of people looking to feel good about themselves
@voxdotcom @morgfair baloney, all Clinton supporters must be angles, right? Fatuous statement!
@MonkovicNYT @morgfair unless Wallace is from CNN or CBS, those debates weren't farces, eh?
@clintm123 @Julie_rodgers @KirstenPowers perhaps they have varied opinions that defy stereotypes
@Julie_rodgers @KirstenPowers oh why? Because they're all bigots?

@GlennKesslerWP @KirstenPowers @DraperRobert @nytimes you need to get out more
@BarackObama @OFA team has a losing record

@ddale8 @Alyssa_Milano yea but at least he didn't make a big jerk out of himself
@HillaryClinton you and what congress?
@EllenBarkin I don't believe it
@Tymlee @wikileaks of course of course
@jamisonfoser @Greytdog so what
@JoyAnnReid @Karoli no, that's why he may be a good president, they were all bad at business
@chrislhayes @Baremid something that's alluded you
@HillaryClinton can't we just drone the guy?
@BruceBartlett @tjemery1 @AP biased. He fired most of them
@bjamesbarlow @BarackObama bad results, senate fault.
@AJAYNY No it's true. Democratic leadership accuses GOP of hatred. Followers blindly accept, feel good about themselves in the process
@mcuban @rationalppl I believe you don't know what draconian means
@BarackObama doesn't grow to 2%. Yea, great economy
@NancyLeeGrahn is he under the impression that they do?
@HillaryClinton @timkaine Hillary quoting Tim quoting Harry.
@AJAYNY don't allow your party to tell you who to hate. Very unbecoming
@AJAYNY @rickdunham @johnlegend @SopanDeb @foxandfriends I may have misspoke. Dems are still the party of racial strife and distortions
@rickdunham @johnlegend @SopanDeb @foxandfriends those were dark days of the dem party

@Glambertoo1 @Joanespring @SenSanders @jsavite well, I don't know about that. Nwo? Not down with that theory
@Joanespring @Glambertoo1 @SenSanders @jsavite ...in Bills case, it was liberals. But they still love them
@Joanespring @Glambertoo1 @SenSanders @jsavite she's just dishonest like her husband. In power we discover who they lied to.
@xeromachine forgiven
@RBReich well, isn't it?
@Karoli @xeromachine necessary to go there?
@Joanespring @Glambertoo1 @SenSanders @jsavite principle over politics. Pro Bernie is the lefts finest hour. At least those that are

@helixion12 @danielmarans grandstanding. I understand his point but, come on. How does that look like
@helixion12 @danielmarans if I were a liberal, Warren would repulse me just the same. Hillary too
@helixion12 @danielmarans I don't know too much about him. On the surface, doesn't sound too bad
@helixion12 @danielmarans must be so effective
@picexec @morgfair time to reconstruct that glass ceiling.
@HillaryClinton keep playing the bigotry card. Nice way to spread love, pull us all together
@Fifthcolumnblue @whedonworship @americablog @Orbitalpigeon ...or Boris type name calling.
@whedonworship @Fifthcolumnblue @americablog @Orbitalpigeon poor leftist. Full of anger and hate.
@whedonworship @Fifthcolumnblue @americablog @Orbitalpigeon enjoy your new foreign secretary
See, he was a bad Muslim. Only a proper one could rightfully claim Islamic radical terrorist tag
@whedonworship @Fifthcolumnblue @americablog @Orbitalpigeon okay, you can't back your assertion, I'm not hear to prove a negative.
@whedonworship @Fifthcolumnblue @americablog @Orbitalpigeon
@Greytdog taking the moral high ground to defend someone who lied to you? Now that's loyalty!
@Greytdog no, 1%ers don't bother me. But they do you, um, that is none with the name Clintons
@Greytdog awwww, KKK card. So clever. Innovative even.
@whedonworship @Fifthcolumnblue @americablog @Orbitalpigeon Wrong. He is a racist whether or not I can prove anything. It's your assertion
@Greytdog no, it's just that she's a 1%er. Mysteriously rich (how?) ranting about income inequality. The left is okay with that
@Greytdog doing what?
@DrSchadNFreude @amb573 @DavidCornDC ....I win again. Thanx guys it was fun, and hey, read a book next time. At least one of you.
@DrSchadNFreude @amb573 @DavidCornDC debating what point? All he does is talk about me. My point is 1%er Hillary and how I miss Bernie
@kengpdx is that what its called, "optics"?
@kengpdx like AG meeting Bill Clinton? Were you concerned about that too?
@kengpdx okay.       And??
@amb573 @DrSchadNFreude @DavidCornDC good luck with 1%er Hillary.She'll equal things out all right. Why are things unequal? Who's in charge?
@kengpdx @Politics1com they meet on a Tarmac?

@charlesrothroc2 @Peacepox @RVAwonk Yea, she's honest! So is her husband. Don't laugh I mean it!
@DrSchadNFreude @amb573 @DavidCornDC Poor liberals. 1%er as standard bearer, makes millions from charity. Think I miss Bernie
@amb573 @DrSchadNFreude @DavidCornDC  Did YOU read the link? The article only accounts for less than half their net worth
@amb573 @DrSchadNFreude @DavidCornDC
@Reschzoo I think she's picking on New Zealand
@NYTNational @jo3_f oh boy what a surprise
@DrSchadNFreude @amb573 @DavidCornDC I did. She &amp; her husband made hundreds of millions doing charitable work. Sounds legit, right? Thx guys
@amb573 @DrSchadNFreude @DavidCornDC  if it doesn't concern you that's okay. But how all that inequality rhetoric working out these days?
@KamalaHarris @UKProgressive @jaketapper that's a totally self serving lie
@Backstorymom1 @paolo_sf you mean he isn't the biggest idiot in the world?
@whedonworship @Orbitalpigeon @americablog correction you do care cutie pie
@ShaunKing @Glambertoo1 ...by Republicans
@whedonworship @Orbitalpigeon @americablog you make an assertion and I have to do research? you got it backwards "old chap"
@DrSchadNFreude @DavidCornDC @realDonaldTrump we do when someone is engaged in it. What did they do to earn THAT much, really?
@DrSchadNFreude @imillhiser come on, "I'm going to New Zealand" just stop it. That's juvenile
@whedonworship @Orbitalpigeon @americablog I'm sure it's all very memorable too. Then why can't you?
@DavidCornDC @realDonaldTrump since your on the subject. Do you happen to know how Clintons got several hundred million? I can't figure it
Not once in eight years?? https://t.co/uRr850nSqx

@TPM so what.
@EricBoehlert defeating Dem aspirations
@stuartpstevens @schwanderer @realDonaldTrump of course, he was out spent the whole primary. Has nothing to do with his fortune
@Orbitalpigeon @americablog no. The left throws this charge everywhere at anyone while redefining what it means. I'm out
@KristinSalaky @TPM yea and
@randyprine @TJWoodstockNY yea but her opinion was so dumb that you have to forgo hypocrisy hunting just this once
@Greytdog doesn't bother you the Clintons $100s of million fortune out of thin air. Tell me More about inequality again? Such a cute story
@progressivehere @jessieopie @jasonmdstein let's see. The courts and congress block him from doing anything yet some things were able 2b ok
@progressivehere @jessieopie @jasonmdstein tops all presidents when it comes to Terrorist attacks. But he doesn't call it that
@progressivehere @jessieopie @jasonmdstein less than 2% growth. A record 94mill not working (63mill in 08). Worst economic prez in history
@americablog you mean if he's against Obama, Hillary he's automatically racist sexists? Nice trick. Where did you learn it?
@progressivehere @jessieopie @jasonmdstein well if that means over 1.8% GDP growth then it's a huge improvement over last 8 miserable years
@HillaryClinton  i know. By the way, while we're on the subject. When was your last press conference?
@DrSchadNFreude @imillhiser ....furthermore nothing in that article is relevant to her behavior
@DrSchadNFreude @imillhiser Ginsberg made a jerk of herself independent of what anyone else ever did in the past. Tired and poor argument
@BroderickGreer @iamrashidajones oooooh, another straw man down
@Greytdog math:1st lady, no pay. Senator couple hundred grand. Author: 15 million? She has 300 million. From where?
@DrSchadNFreude refresh, what did he do?
@Greytdog she's worth 300 million. She was First Lady, senator and sectry state, How'd she get so 1 percenty?
@Greytdog I fail to see how she gets a pass or how she has 100rds of millions by holding office, you?
@richardbranson nonsense
@NickCannon or why we should get one in the first place
@Greytdog not surprised you poor little thing
@elyse4design  obviously very happy with the work they did, excuses they or others fed you. Anything for the team
@Greytdog She did not tell you the truth about any aspect. Geez can't you stick to principle w/o rooting 4 crooks
@Greytdog poor analogy $4000 jacket to state it's unfair some people have a lot of money, others don't?
@elyse4design @pharris830 no, the reverse is true. Then they 1. Hid and deleted emails 2. Destroyed computers. Typical
@Greytdog how bout that $4000 Armonie suit she wore addressing inequality. Perfectly normal right?
@Greytdog I'm just going by last weeks FBI report. They lied then
@jilevin oh then Ginsberg didn't make a total ass of herself after all. Thanks for the research
@Greytdog you don't agree with the anti-Hillary article. She's a total liar and rich elitist. You keep defending her tho
@pharris830 @elyse4design IRS became the tool to use against political enemies of Obama. Yes abolish it
@DrSchadNFreude  Ginsberg way off base, totally unprofessional. But its okay by the left.
@TPM gee, I wonder why?
@geoff9cow @jeffkreisler I see you're still busy at this
@BettyBowers @geoff9cow @realDonaldTrump totally made up. Ginsberg should not be on the court
@jeffkreisler @geoff9cow that is soooo clever
@iamdebbiem oh wow Debbie you are so full of wisdom, don't ever stop. Puuuuuleeeez
If the purpose of a soda tax is to restrict consumption, what is the reason for a tax on manufacturing
@andersoncooper but it's news. Will you identify the weapon?
@JenniferS_S @HillaryClinton They only inquire into criminality
@Forumblue32 @HillaryClinton by lack of votes, yes. Also in the constitution
@sallykohn I think you knocked down just about all the strawmen there
@HillaryClinton stop them from walking the streets, no? From buying guns? Then what, let them go?
@HillaryClinton If the FBI is watching you for any reason maybe you can't buy guns or run for president
@glennbeck background checks and bans will do the trick. Which? Guns or Muslims
@WeepingSophia @PrisonPlanet Too much time on their hands. Teaching them lunatic studies 0 value in the real world. Teaching hate
@CTseangrace @jamieson ...also article is flippant. Oh well, if wage is 15, they're just going to have to adjust. Fantasy land
@CTseangrace @jamieson @CTseangrace @jamies Wage is tied to supply/demand of jobs. MinWage is price control. Will create shortage of jobs
@WeepingSophia @PrisonPlanet use what against whites?
@WeepingSophia @PrisonPlanet total lunacy, bullying in fact
@ChrisMurphyCT  rigging the system to make up for horrible business climate. What's the plan
@InquisitiveMarg @MrsZiggy1988 it should just be presidents

@CarlaLioness @Peacepox who eats whales? more important, what wine would go good with that?
@speechboy71 @dmcrane increasing? he keeps winning primaries. but, he wins the primaries, she gets the delegates. manism at work here
@Criticalanglez @Peacepox what did they use in those wars, bow and arrow?
@NellieBowles @MikeElk she was like, you were like, everyone was like
@obbiecole @Peacepox battle scars? Where was she ever victorious
@GlennFranco68 @MomSense Walker no Rino. But it looks like the people are turning away from Trump. Polls not good here
@Greytdog No, only in Wash politics could an increase of $1.3 billion  amount to a spending cut. Another 5 million makes a difference?
@Greytdog In short, if you read closely in each (not mcclatch) the "cuts" do not mean spending but less of an increase
@Greytdog Steven refusal: unnamed source citing secret docs. Not sceptical tho. Howevr in article State refused adding additional security
@Greytdog @GOP Hill article Prez makes request, congress bids lower. They met in the middle. No cuts. Wording in both call it cuts. Not
@cher Obama happened
@AuntCole22 @morgfair He doesn't have that control. Each state has their own rules on delegates when a candidate drops out
@Greytdog @GOP Still not showing me congress cut the budget. Maybe the talking point you repeat like a loyal foot soulder is wrong? I
@Greytdog @GOP I bet you cannot demonstrate that Congress cut state budget. But why was added security turned down for Lybia?
@mcwbr ...even though socialism is an utter failure, but we covered that. It just doesn't resonate with you dinosaurs, so yesturcentury
@mcwbr Well I hope your guy wins the primary just the same. At least one liberal is honest enough to say he's socialist
@Greytdog When Hillary State Dept refuses security request, do you really want more staff in the first place?
@johnleesandiego @ramseur Kardashistan?
@mcwbr Because I said America is better than any socialist country? Maybe your right. Where do you live, Sweden, Denmark?
@mmfa @Peacepox Then make it $35 an hour if the rules of economics is all a myth
@ramseur @johnleesandiego or some Islamic country
@mcwbr But we're not and we're better. So there
@MoonAngelWings Tried and tested way to get votes, no?
@mcwbr Too many socialist out there even tho it's a 100% failure everywhere it's tried so your right, more education is needed
@WorldForBernie @HillaryClinton @BernieSanders @joybrk Bernie has policies that will change full to empty. Hope he beats Shrillary though
@NolteNC @1crazystlgal I'm sure you have so many examples of this too.
@chrislhayes Get a TV show with that name too....unless you already do
@chucktodd @JohnKasich @MSNBC like finding anyone to vote for him?
@JimArkedis @MoonAngelWings Socialist always produce 'little to show for it'
@Greytdog Except when they request it and State turns it down, you know, like Libyia
@HillaryClinton Every consulate deserves access to security, if you don't get that....
@BarracudaMama He ought to know being the last choice
@BarackObama France then Chicago. He knows when to be there, too bad you can't play a guitar. Maybe you wld show up too
@HillaryClinton ....like it was all because of a YouTube vide...oops, wrong candidate
@realDonaldTrump Nice job, you managed to leave a town without anyone having a bloody nose
@AngelinaWalks Nice dodge though. Wasn't unnoticed. We're not alone here. C ya
@AngelinaWalks No, when you can't answer the question it's no my "meaty" but your judgement
@AngelinaWalks One or two lies is an honest person to you? If one or two, how do you know if anymore, oh, Politifact. Forgot
@AngelinaWalks I did get you to agree on one lie. Progress
@AngelinaWalks....20 minutes later she proclaimed YouTube video was the blame. Both true to you? Pulitzer Price Politifact?
@AngelinaWalks in the emails she said to Chelsea that Benghazi attack was carried out by known terrorist and correctly named them....
@AngelinaWalks everyone knows phones can carry several email addresses, do you? Does she?
@AngelinaWalks of course not. Good, you agree she wasn't truthful
@AngelinaWalks 2. When she said she set up server bc she didn't want to carry two phones, is that believable knowing phones are not limited?
@AngelinaWalks lets do this: was she truthful about, say, dodging Bosnian fire?
@AngelinaWalks hang out with someone if you must. Beats thinking for yourself
@AngelinaWalks dont trust me or Politifact . Where is your common sense?
@AngelinaWalks "trained" good word, must be projecting.
@AngelinaWalks btw, don't strain yourself with your own judgement. Politifact and others will do all the thinking for you
@AngelinaWalks ...that is if Bernie the socialist beats her. But that's all rigged. Yeah, her candidacy will be very popular.
@AngelinaWalks At the behest of IG of State Dept. Don't worry, no indightment. Justice Dept won't allow it. Your stuck w flawed candidate
@AngelinaWalks I guess we shouldn't take the FBI seriously either. Original question says it all, it "shocks" us to think she's honest
@MMFlint yet you still live here
@MarkRuffalo in other words, she's lying again
@LibertySeeds @RepScottRigell He hasn't won yet
@AngelinaWalks "But they have a Pulitzer". Fine. Do YOU have your own judgement or do you always need to appeal to a higher authority
@AngelinaWalks If she didn't have a history of blatant dishonesty the question wouldn't come up "this may surprise you" they say. Duhhhh!
@AngelinaWalks Do you really need a news org to tell you? Bosnian sniper fire, making 100k in cattle trading, Email server b/c of her phone
@AngelinaWalks @Donkey_Feed @HillaryClinton @Rocky1542 Well as she says, she "tries" to tell the truth. Takes effort for her
@Donkey_Feed @HillaryClinton @Rocky1542 Shocks just about everyone
@RogerJStoneJr @realDonaldTrump @harryseeword Best convention vote counter? What is he 96 years old?
@Media4LifeMin No, Enquirer
@Media4LifeMin Non-story, no?
@Cookiemuffen If I was pissed at life as you say, I'd be having a Trumpgasm like you. No, I'm fine
@martinriggspdx @hulabird1 It's not an all out attack now? Poor Trump is getting picked on all this time?
@Cookiemuffen Alright, that's fine. It's just fun for me to see some on the right act like our real nemesis. No evidence, that's the key
@O_IrishT @Mferris67 I don't see Trump winning, I know you're a big fan and all. He's not cut out for this
@Media4LifeMin @tedcruz @O_IrishT Enquirer owner is a friend of Trump, let's stop pretending
@Cookiemuffen Your right, I should do more of what you're doing and that would make me so much happier
@Cookiemuffen @Doug_Giles @hulabird1 By all means then, have a hand in his destruction
@ScotchJLK @martinriggspdx @UTHornsRawk @tedcruz @marcorubio Exposed? There are no hard facts?
@martinriggspdx @hulabird1 Why wait? You like Trump therefore it must be true, no?

@hulabird1 @Sherri1030 @tedcruz Decent Tweets? Well you went through them all, where is the evidence?
@r_p_mc_murphy @hulabird1 But Trump may not win the necessary amount, he has to stay lots of delegates left
@twocentsandmore @trumper4life @SavageNation @DanScavino @hulabird1 But where is the evidence? Can't let it die, how is it alive at all?
@Sherri1030 @tedcruz @hulabird1 Any real evidence? Or is it that if you like Trump, then it's all true?

@peta @pamfoundation Does blackfish go well with Merlo? I never had it.
@KyleKulinski @FuckCons so did the Democratics, passed with majority of Republicans; okay minus Goldwater I guess
@mtnthunder I actually agree with that as a general princible
@ZoeyGirlz @cjwerleman @FLOTUS thanks
@joewo @bennydiego I don't have a point, it's just your argument is without reason. I guess I needed to demonstrate that.
@joewo @bennydiego no, you did a splendid job
@joewo since it works just fine under socialism, then tell us more about how the profits and wages thing is goin fer ya?
@joewo @bennydiego shortages and gulags
@joewo if you say so
@joewo @bennydiego well, she sent me to my room, but not the gulag
@joewo @bennydiego good looking?
@joewo @bennydiego yes I did. If corporates profits are up, it doesn't lead to paying more for pencils, copper, water coolers or labor
@joewo @bennydiego well, I guess I am. Not striving to be
@joewo @bennydiego I don't know, get them off food stamps?
@joewo @bennydiego don't understand the question. Uphold the economy?
@joewo @bennydiego ....anyone well versed in TRICKLE DOWN!!!!!! to help this guy out?
@joewo @bennydiego I never mentioned trickle down. It isn't an actual school of thought so I can't defend it. Address MY argument
@joewo @bennydiego I haven't mentioned trickle down or food stamps. Try addressing what I say not your own inventions
@joewo @bennydiego labor is subject to supply &amp; demand. It's like asking if profits are up why aren't they paying more 4 pencils and copper
@joewo @bennydiego if wages are down it could be because the supply of labor is high (93 million not working, a record).
@joewo @bennydiego ...if profits are up, who is making all that money and buying things from those corporations? People with wages perhaps?
@joewo @bennydiego you poor guy, you don't listen. One thing is a separate issue from the other......
@joewo @bennydiego not to argue over a trifling fact but you don't divide money and then it grows.
@joewo @bennydiego perhaps one thing has nothing to do with the other, wealth is not fixed. Money doesn't work like that
@joewo @bennydiego ...,so they don't have my money nor yours, they have money that had not ever existed created by an idea
@joewo @bennydiego wrong. Wealth is not a fixed commodity. It's created anew by people who make something out of nothing
@joewo @bennydiego so we harken back to a tried and failed idea?The notion of wealth "concentrated" is a canard. No rich person has my money
@sweetbay @thehill @Reince @SouthboundRiser Bernie and Hillary detractors don't riot in the street. Does that answer the question?
@davidbadash @thecolonel54 Fine, it's not a cover up. But she did get caught in a lie while attempting to ingratiate herself in a moment
@bennydiego @joewo I remember those old days. Strange times, you know socialism was all the rage back them. Ah. But that was a long time ago
@mtnthunder @NPR far more beneficial than the supposed downside in the article
@mtnthunder @NPR ....most people by far benefit by cheaper oil. As for "energy independence" I was never an advocate of that.
@mtnthunder @NPR okay I read it. I stand by my last (really funny) comment. Of course some people get hurt but....
@mtnthunder btw, what private personal behavior is the "church" trying to make, I don't know, illegal?
@mtnthunder they can try to legislate all they want, no one is going to sign the bill. Mzzz Beatty is advocating taking away rights.

@thedeaconblue @blackgirlinmain really, what problem do we have?

@StopNuclearWar @FuckCons Not if you confuse legal with illegal immigrants
@UKProgressive well isn't that clear?
@thedeaconblue @blackgirlinmain She should relax, take a deep breath.
@LindaBeatty @mtnthunder 50% of the people also pay no taxes. How far do you want to go with making laws against what people have to say?
@jilevin oh Hillary, just drop it. Your peeps will forgive and most important, forget just like everything else you say and do
@blackgirlinmain @thedeaconblue otherwise no one will die for like 8 months
@Karoli @realDonaldTrump it's too bad the left plays that card with all its dissenters, rings hollow at a time when it can be true
@C_A_Trump @Peacepox not comfortable with laws telling the press what it can or can't cover
@mtnthunder @NPR lower prices, duhhh
@BillKristol @cody_k That would be disasterous. Unlikely. Contested convention, yes
@BillMoyersHQ @RBReich But fascist rose from internal strife and dispair. Have 7 years of Obama given us that? How far do u want 2go w thT?

@thrulookinglass @NicholsUprising @BernieSanders @RevJJackson I didn't call you one. That was a charge you leveled at me. Am I wrong?
@chief3946 @BernieSanders @TheNewDeal My people aren't occupying anything. I think you got my people mixed up with someone else's
@ZoeyGirlz @cjwerleman @FLOTUS I'm not surprised
@thrulookinglass @NicholsUprising @BernieSanders @RevJJackson boy, someone needs a therapist
@thrulookinglass @NicholsUprising @BernieSanders @RevJJackson I'm stuck in the 50's, a bigot. Jackson lost did he not? Should I say he won?
@dennis_reichel @TheNewDeal but wouldn't the popular vote be indecisive in order for them to kick into a deciding role?
@thrulookinglass @NicholsUprising @BernieSanders @RevJJackson ....meant bigot
@thrulookinglass @NicholsUprising @BernieSanders @RevJJackson I just casually observed at the time that Jackson lost. Guess I'm a bogot
@cjwerleman @FLOTUS @ZoeyGirlz does that really have to be asked?
@TheNewDeal he wins the states and Hillary takes the delegates. Why don't you guys complain about that?
@NicholsUprising @BernieSanders @RevJJackson boy did he get a lot of votes too. Not
@BernieSanders @TheNewDeal Yes we can!
@A2S remember the jobs bill (350 billion) he couldn't pass? That failure effectively shut him out of countries economic affairs
@A2S but Obama wasn't able to enact anything couldn't spend much
@A2S In fairness the economy is doing slightly better, still below 2%. Just keep in mind, Obama has enacted no economic policies in 6 years
@A2S No, Bureau of Labor statistic facts, people rioting facts. Tell the occupy crowd, Bernie, things are great. Show the graphs
@A2S 63 million out of work in 2008, now it's 93 million. Are you a misery denier? Oh Forbes article, it has graphs and stuff. Please
@A2S  It's a miserable economy in real life. Candidates can't feed off anger in good times. Keep your graphs. Sophistry
@A2S Not a chance. Labor participation down by 50% is excused by retiring boomers? No attribution. 2% growth, barely is also excused
@DrTomMartinPhD @dmcrane somehow I bet few doubt that
@CaldiusBiberius @johnlegend @Toure look it up, not my words
@A2S he seems to be the standard. But O falls short. Miserable economy. But he can do no wrong with you guys even when the results r awful
@SenFeinstein certainly people must be dying in the streets over unsafe shampoo and lotions
@A2S less than 2% growth a year, 30 million less people working, sure better than Reagan, of course
@jonathanalter less than 2% growth a year, 30 million less people working, I guess it doesn't take much
@LLaws2 @BernieSanders @smuckers @Hersheys @bsonder GMO's are safe. Zero evidence they're not
@PlankySmith Remember when Edwards wife was dying and he was obsessing over a photographer. No one is worse than that
@johnlegend @Toure get the NAACP on that, while your at it ask them about the "c" in their name
@BillMoyersHQ That they have an incredibly boring life?
@Dasani_01 or the other way around. :)
@Toure I hope they don't take knives to a gun fight

@archivesgirl1 @Capt_Kirk45 what about Trump advocating war crimes?
@UncleRUSH @MGH_8 I disagree
@MuellerDebi @Change @Peacepox funny how pro-choice people get worked up over this
@allanbrauer @sdXpdx but he's the logical conclusion of what Dems believe but would never say
@KagroX try gun laws fail
@ruthsatchfield @sdXpdx so where does he have the power to do that, where is it against the law to hire temps, or does law even matter?
Trump is a fraud conservative. I do not support. Oh, he's an advocate of war crimes. Take that Trumpers
@drvox  because he has no chance?
@mitchellreports @SenFeinstein well then I'm sure it's just a big misunderstanding then
@cody_k oh, excuse me. FBI general inquiry
@chrislhayes do you have a team of writers helping you with this? That was brilliant
@ZaidJilani @MikeElk certainly not from liberals

@mcwbr under your definition of terrorism, independent of anyone else, is Hamas a terrorist group?
@mcwbr http://t.co/HrmD0r5BpM
@mcwbr .....and it works, obviously
@mcwbr deliberate target of civilians. Putting their own in harms way then when they get hit take photos to manipulate the likes if you
@mcwbr we do not nor does Isreal kill innocent people purposely nor with suicide bombers
@mcwbr old fashion moral equivalence. Hamas is a terrorist group and the definition isn't up for grabs
@mcwbr is Hamas a terrorist group?
@mcwbr no. Isreal nor us deliberately kill civilians and you know it. Don't defend Hamas through moral equivalence, it doesn't work
@mcwbr they are not. Hamas deliberately kills innocent civilians. Are u going to answer: are they not terrorists?
@BlueDuPage @Rocky1542 @SpeakerBoehner @netanyahu ...just how well is that diplomacy working?
@BlueDuPage @Rocky1542 @SpeakerBoehner @netanyahu you mean the country that released video of blowing up a mock US carrier?
@DWStweets @TheDemocrats @FLOTUS oh please. Btw way, watch what you eat
@thinkprogress they're doing so under obamacare
@KagroX Obama paid a rate of 18% taxes, us he guilty if the same thing?
@mcwbr Hamas does so deliberately and ensures their civilians are in harms way when countering their terrorist acts
@mcwbr I'm not convinced by pictures. The question for you is: is Hamas a terrorist group?
@mcwbr your article takes as a given that Hamas has a right to attack Isreal, no?
@mcwbr they are repeatedly attacked by a terrorist organization
@mcwbr such as?
@mcwbr nice pics. They were attacked by Hamas who use civilian shields
@TJWoodstockNY I don't care about prophesy
@TJWoodstockNY the west is only threatening to stop a nuclear Iran, aren't you for that?
@mcwbr siding with an ally in what has always been mutual aims and that's stopping Iran ambitions
@TJWoodstockNY @MilitaryTimes that doesn't allow them to have the bomb. We should not head to extortion
@mcwbr traitors are not the sort that allow allies to speak to congress. Since when is Isreal an enemy?
@TJWoodstockNY turkey is in NATO, rethink that. All others no match for us
@TJWoodstockNY @waltb31 should Iran be stopped from having nuks, why is this a hard question?
@TJWoodstockNY  80 million what?
@InaMaziarcz @esd2000 so? What's your point?
@TJWoodstockNY but Isreal was not going to drop a N-bomb. So how did Obama avert WWIII?
@TJWoodstockNY @waltb31 I guess the only question for you is, should Iran be allowed to have the bomb?
@TJWoodstockNY @waltb31 doesn't explain WWIII, certainly lessor bombs can do substantial damage
@TJWoodstockNY  I don't see your point
@TJWoodstockNY @waltb31 well you are, suppose you can explain
@TJWoodstockNY @waltb31 can't counter ad hominid sorry
@waltb31 @TJWoodstockNY
@TJWoodstockNY @waltb31 ...and I don't necessarily stand by that source btw
@TJWoodstockNY @waltb31 threatening to shoot down Israelly planes prevents WWIII, how???
@waltb31 @TJWoodstockNY how is it that a liberal dem can say such a thing, I wonder?
@TJWoodstockNY @waltb31 if this story is true.... http://t.co/Tojqg15lbf
@InaMaziarcz @esd2000  allowing an ally of the US, one who opposes nuclear Iran, is decisive??

@Chernynkaya @KansasLib but it was a workaround congress that started this whole mess. how many workarounds can this guy use?
@PoliticalVodka @lexky1 but we consent to taxation with representation. no one consented to forfeiture of  their religious rights

@Greytdog ..in that case by all means
@Xultar if I need medicine, I get it. if someone else is not paying for it, I do. I don't have a right to other peoples money
@PoliticalVodka @lexky1 it about govt coercion, not religion. some day the govt will coerce you into something you don't agree with.
@Xultar your rights and health should not depend on other peoples money.
@Xultar fine, pay for it.
@Xultar @eclecticbrotha but even if they don't, it assumes personhood. is it the case that govt should restrict speech and religion?
@Greytdog good question. why should they have a staff?
@PoliticalVodka @lexky1 um, huh?
@eclecticbrotha @Xultar what else are they, trees? of course they're people. too bad govt cant restrict speech and religious freedom, eh?
@EWDolan yes by all means read this article, the white house is telling us what we must think and say of this ruling, please read and obey

@ErikLoomis @MikeElk it was a victory over govt and organizations forcing people to do what they do not consent to do. deal with it

@helixion12 I'm not familiar with the case
@soonergrunt certainly to prevent and prosecute. but that does not entail a material obligation or "responsibility" which is your point.
@soonergrunt it is of the interest of the individual not to get hit on the head and not dependent on the interest of the state
@soonergrunt ...keep responding, I gotta drive home. will catch this later
@soonergrunt ....decided purely for the interest of the state.
@soonergrunt you separated the two: "If we as a society had decided that the state had a compelling national interest..." laws are not....
@soonergrunt  but it is in the interest of saving lives to which the public always had an interest
@soonergrunt but you do say there are plenty of reasons people can foist their beliefs on others through law, I don't agree
@soonergrunt ....not make my argument against murder less valid, or for genocide for that matter
@soonergrunt....and being against genocide is not contingent on economic factors. I can't physically stop murders, for instance, does.....
@soonergrunt but laws do not have to conform to the interest of the state in order for their legitimacy, but to the interest of the ppl
@soonergrunt you bring up a point that needs some clarity. is there any reason at all we should use the state foist beliefs on others?
@soonergrunt your point logically extends 2 this: no poor man could be against genocide since they have not the means 2 support the victims
@soonergrunt you are making a point that life is not worth living if the economics are not right. I don't think you want to go there do you?
@soonergrunt I can't speak on behalf of any faith. my arguments are not based on religion but  on reason
@soonergrunt by position is not more valid if I were a billionaire and pledged economic support for those not aborted, right?
@soonergrunt that depends on the idea that I have to give economic support. one has zero to do with the other
@soonergrunt but if I were to follow your reasoning, then I would have to excuse genocide bc I can't afford to support the victims
@soonergrunt if that were a principle then we could deny the right to life of quadriplegics.
@soonergrunt but it does extend to the rights of individuals and one of those rights is life.
@djlovesyou @rickygervais @jhaugan but these methods are used in the US
@soonergrunt I back my positions and take responsibility for my actions. what are you trying to say here?
@soonergrunt you haven't spelled out dishonest nor immoral. is just saying it proof enough?
@soonergrunt I use that reasoning when it comes to Obamacare. but when life is destroyed people speak up,its legitimate concern n democracy
@djlovesyou @rickygervais @jhaugan what is legal now is not the destruction of a "bunch of cells" it has a head, arms, legs, etc.
@soonergrunt if you want to make that case.
@soonergrunt I can't but that does not necessarily follow that life ought to be destroyed.
@realDonaldTrump @Macys no toy helicopters?
@soonergrunt now we have safer means to destroy human life in its begging stages. you win
@rickygervais @jhaugan if it's a "bunch of cells" then why use an instrument designed to crush a head and vacuum the brain? eh Ricky?
@soonergrunt I didn't bring it up. your side made the comparison. not wound up about it. the pics are as gruesome as the act itself
@soonergrunt I'm not upset. but do the pictures upset you?
@BillMoyersHQ @GregMitch if only he had shown Saddam's work in genocide, it wold have been better.
@soonergrunt I didn't say it wasn't okay, just bad taste for a promotional trinkit. the photos are the actual result of what the act is.
@ProudlyLiberal2 who's having old children?
@KagroX you spout your opinions publicly then when challenged you rant like a little bitch.
@soonergrunt we were talking about one thing, not two. do you know what hypocrisy means?
@helixion12 correct
@soonergrunt what hypocrisy?
@DCPlod in the very least it is a human life at its earliest stage
@KagroX another dodge and typical name calling as expected with unthinking lib
@DCPlod okay, that's fine. but the photos are gruesome, aren't they? a person is destroyed in the earliest stages of life, right. gruesome.
@helixion12 good ron. the legal question in the case is if a women does harm to her baby, should she be held liable to the harm of another?
@KagroX you: guns are bad, should be banned, why, look at all these accidents. am I right?
@soonergrunt @DCPlod  photos convey the actual product, why be against the truth?
@soonergrunt @DCPlod no, the photos convey the actual product, not a distinction. what distinction?
@DCPlod photos represent present and past fact.
@KagroX no, the faulty reasoning you convey
@DCPlod why shouldn't it be? pictures show the truth, the pendants are horrible taste
@KagroX  more than that in car accidents, lets ban cars with that reasoning
@helixion12 article title doesn't spell out the legal issue

@calickizzle I gave you links of where specific layoffs were
@calickizzle with so many out of work it is an indication that busn cannot expand when labor expenses are uncertain
@calickizzle I give you links citing it does and you give links citing it doesn't.
@JohnFugelsang gee john you got it all figured out
@RichardDawkins you did speculate that it could be the case, you are saying it on camera in a documentary
@PlankySmith you know a lot about me. I'm flattered you would take the time to pay so much attention. thanks
@PlankySmith reasoned debate? calling people names? is that the morality part?
@PlankySmith didn't say we were. but liberals, as you state, are. reading "codes" etc.taking what's said and turning it into what wsn't said
@PlankySmith "coded language" "dog whistles"?  so we rely on the deciphering ability of liberals to let us in on their true thoughts. please
@Auriandra the graph shows the deficit declining after 2009. but rising after 2015. a point can be made Obama is driving def up?
@Auriandra time to impeach Bush
@geoff9cow @LOLGOP @GOP but they don't say that
@calickizzle ...for instance "expanding &amp; making health care affordable" you know this is not what's occurring. this is ur "evidence-based"?
@calickizzle but I shot down all your evidence. layoffs, failure of obamacare. unemployment. at some point u have to change ur mind
@calickizzle sure, if people sign up, when employee mandate kicks in. none of this is working, so how does it save now?
@calickizzle this bill doesn't do that. if you saw things as they are and not what ur told, u cld become a conservative
@calickizzle also, I wouldn't be for the law if it were funded or not
@calickizzle the major funding is from young ppl signing up, these numbers are not good at all. this is a big problem.
@calickizzle there are more people leaving the job market than getting jobs. these job numbers are not good, growth yes, but anemic
@calickizzle that was pertaining to layoffs
@calickizzle yea so. why suddenly you're fixated on funding? I never brought it up.
@calickizzle transfer from Medicare advantage? But medicare isn't solvent. how does it pay for Obamacare?
@calickizzle it hasn't been fully implemented. the administration says it's "paid for", do you believe everything he says?
@calickizzle let's not kid ourselves, nothing is "paid for". but medicare part D should be scrapped. I don't rah rah everything Republcn
@calickizzle don't take my word for anything, you asked a question, I answered and provided links. it isn't about me.
@calickizzle It causes job loses, it doesn't mean no none is hiring. however 92 million not working is a horrible record and anothr argument
@alfranken  you have no way of knowing that, or do you?
@calickizzle ....now I think is the time you rant about Bush
@calickizzle medical device layoffs: http://t.co/nd5zEYDxJx although this is labeled "half true"
@calickizzle you want more, I can provide it. just go on and demonstrate your cult like defense of the indefensible
@calickizzle ...and this http://t.co/DZ7qRWxmbS
@calickizzle and there's this: http://t.co/QXoywQs08l
@calickizzle I wasn't. u asked if Obamacare caused lost of jobs, I gave it 2u. think for yourself, don't parrot the party line or defend it
@calickizzle I cited you a Hill article that showed just that, certainly you read it, why ask again?
@calickizzle Obama would not have delayed the employee madate if it didn't. obviously it is damaging, premiums rise, layoffs ensure,like now
@calickizzle no, you wanted evidence of Obamacare causing lost of jobs and I gave it to you. why change the subject?
@calickizzle I see. I demonstrate that Obamacare is shedding jobs and you revert to Dubya? come on.
@calickizzle maybe blocking Obama's agenda, gridlock, sequestration, govt shut downs etc does have a positive affect, ever think of that?
@calickizzle but these companies are laying off as a result of the jobs
@calickizzle it shouldn't exist. but are you suggesting to tax at the expense of jobs?
@calickizzle no, 92million out of work. UE stat is low because ppl leaving the work force.as for Obmacare: http://t.co/mpLrONYkha
@calickizzle ur right in interpretation of CBO but there are currently lost of jobs bc of the law
@calickizzle for someone else if the terms wr right. I wrk for myself now. running a business is not an easy option
@calickizzle no need to scrap the entire insurance market with this monstrosity. but is it a good law to you just bc Dem made the law?
@calickizzle .....jobs are being lost now: medical devise manufacturers, clinics. I would think the CBO (mistakenly) wz citing the obvious
@calickizzle ur right CBO reports ppl will not think it necessary to work because of the tie to insurance.....but
@calickizzle Craig, is it possible to you that Obamacare could be a bad law?
@calickizzle I think the problem is liberalism has become a cult your arguments are not wrong but irrational
@calickizzle that's all I've done. how am I going to counter something you even know is wrong
@calickizzle remove caps?why didn't anybody in the world ever think of that?
@calickizzle But CBO does say that. Are they wrong?
@calickizzle but those progrms have solvency issues.but aside frm that, this is poorly constrcted.delay all but admits that. delay for what?

@Emperor_Bob am I? this year the economy grew larger than any other Obama year, so your saying the shutdown was bad for the economy? how?
@Emperor_Bob not ready?? after 4 years?? no, it's bc of what happened last year will happen with employer based insurance, u must know that
@Emperor_Bob 85% had insurance b4 Obamacare. with obamacare that percentile will pay more in premiums with higher deductibles.
@Emperor_Bob but it will affect a majority of people who work, perhaps not a majority of business, that's what I mean by trick
@Emperor_Bob you're right, the tax code does favor the rich because the code allows for deductibles and they have more of them
@Emperor_Bob correct, the last tax cuts were 4 evry person who paid taxes, it wasn't a "tax cut for the rich"don't accept evrytg libs tell u
@Emperor_Bob well there are 92 million out of work, suppose you kinda figure that the "economists" are wrong, what'ya say?
@Emperor_Bob now your making things up. Obamacare is a direct and tangible cost on employers,not shuttng down monument parks in Washington.
@Emperor_Bob ....think, no really think, why are they postponing the employer mandate till after election? because it will help? come on.
@Emperor_Bob but a majority of workers don't work at places with 20 or fewer workers. nice trick. Obamacare will hurt workers......
@Emperor_Bob lots of studies here from people I don't know or methodology being used. can I give u an opposite conclusion w/ studies,I can?
@Emperor_Bob that wasn't the point which was no one ever had a tax cut exclusively for the rich.
@Emperor_Bob irrelevant, want to discus tax code? we can, not germane to our discussion
@Emperor_Bob and neither did you. but it is a $350bill bill just like the $850bill bill that was totally ineffective Keynesian discredited
@Emperor_Bob there are 92 million people not at a job, almost a third of the country. no, ur wrong, and the word "save" is Obama talkg point

@LisaToddSutton @edshow I see, they just quit their jobs because who needs a job anyway
@vj44 @TheJusticeDept why launch a program when it's already against the law, and why just Native Americn women?
@davidaxelrod lost cause. money can't nuance a 92 million out of work and a health plan that is a total disaster that get worse every day
@calickizzle you haven't. administration gives you talking points and you pretend it's your own.
@calickizzle ok fine, listen to Paul Ryan, CBO versus Paul Ryan, u like what he says so all of a sudden you think he's right.
@calickizzle well he should put it in his report. 2.5 million lost. you think that's not a contradiction?
@calickizzle ...they were bad jobs anyway. do you just repeat what they tell you. is it truth from power and so its ok bc it's ur people?
@calickizzle  at what point do you look at this objectively? ppl lose insurnc they say it was bad insurc anyway. ppl losing jobs they say...
@Emperor_Bob ....you go ahead and blame them for a bad economy? try looking at the guy in charge, when does the buck stop at ur hero?
@Emperor_Bob  taxes were raised on the wealthy in 2013, investmt returns are smaller. when they dn't invest so much as a result.....
@Emperor_Bob the problem isn't "the rich" it is the dearth of opportunities that others aren't getting in Obama economy.
@Emperor_Bob no it doesn't, how do I know? 800billn stimulus was to do just that "shovel ready" remember?
@calickizzle jobs they hate? how does the authors of that talking point know that? also, CBO reported that people will have no insurance too
@calickizzle CBO
@Beloving2 @FactsInYourFace crypto-diva
@RichardDawkins the answer to how first DNA might have formed is a big problem with few answers
@calickizzle don't worry, new report indicates this phenomenon will spread into other counties, make things more equal that way
@Emperor_Bob but you assume that the 1% is the reason for our current economic stagnation. how do you make that case, Obama is in charge,no?
@Emperor_Bob his plans do not produce new wealth. if I'm wrong, tell me how?
@QuincyDJones ah but if you forget then it's imperative to get where your going. bet you didn't think of that
@mcwbr I don't fully know what your saying here. I can't deny or accept
@mcwbr why not, why stop there?
@mcwbr no more, no less. I didn't say we can't trust plumbers the same way as billionairs
@mcwbr I deny we're in a monied aristocracy
@mcwbr ...you're just not convincing.
@mcwbr but when I prod you into details, your argument falls apart. nothing to do with what I think
@MonicaCrowley was obvious. not for the obamalogues though
@TheEllenShow ...get out the kilts
@realDonaldTrump 92 million out of work now. wld anyone last 3 yrs expand and hire w/ this unknown expense? 2.3m is generous
@ByronYork that would imply objectivity
@secupp @NYDailyNews hope it works
@mcwbr you haven't made the argument.
@mcwbr not that it's germane to our discussion but yes they did squabble (war of roses, on example) did it help peasants, no, fodder, yes.
@aterkel @HuffPostMedia its like working for Woolwerth
@mcwbr oh now. we were being specific here and now we have generalities and metaphors. there's no arguing against any of that
@mcwbr that is not to say they are united when to comes to govt policy. certainly we know they are not
@StopGap1120 and I was debunking that, have a nice flight, will catch you later
@StopGap1120 come back when you have a chance.
@StopGap1120 when you speak to them, do the same. I have a problem w/ exec orders, don't know if it's the same as theirs
@StopGap1120 Dem never passed a budget under Obama and Reid. it is the only time to debate policy. big difference
@StopGap1120 stick to one topic, u don't need a lot of space for a concise argument.
@mcwbr George Soros has common interest with Warren Buffet and Bill Gates? I don't buy it
@StopGap1120 so when you talk to someone on FoxNews , make sure you bring it up
@StopGap1120 I can set u straight on any one of these, you have to stick to one topic. ur occupy bumper sticker is wrong on all counts
@StopGap1120 we can argue policy or joust bumper sticker platitudes. is that how you come to ur conclusions?
@mcwbr not if they dismantle the toilets. but u assume that legislators are being bribed. billionairs,like evry1 else r diverse politically
@StopGap1120 the amount of executive orders is not the issue, not with me at least.
@StopGap1120 no, he does new things but like all presidents before, is being criticized. is he not supposed to be crticized?
@StopGap1120 "right" so you agree. "right". then why did you use it as an analogy to Obamacare? SS was never a dble digt income tax
@StopGap1120 not that you're curious, you seem more interested in keeping score, something like a fan, cheerleader
@mcwbr no more than to say plumbers can be trusted or ten thousand-aires can be trusted. u contend that they r inherently distructive
@StopGap1120 incorrect. these policies did not cause economic disruptions in their roll out.
@StopGap1120 actually, since you keep score, the meltdown was a result of Dem policies, not GOP. one policy in particular
@WestWingReport if true then can we say GOP obstructionism to spending is the result?
@StopGap1120 ok fine. tell me why a policy that puts people out of work and without insurance is a success?
@Emperor_Bob if Obama can't get his bills passed in congress and the deficit drops, what does that tell you?
@StopGap1120 stop policies that hurt, like this one. why is this all about the GOP anyway.ppl losing insurance and jobs,that's okay with u?
@StopGap1120  a policy putting people out of work as well as losing insurance, it's ok, it's all about the bad GOP. cult reasoning
@ChicoDelainky its about me? your guy's policy is putting millions out of work. it's ok b/c u think it was worse before?

@mcwbr  just countering your assertion of billionaires. there is an assumption that by virtue of their wealth lies ill intentions, thr bad
@mcwbr his race. that was his big attraction. otherwise you're suggesting somewhat of a conspiracy by billionaires.impossible to prove
@mcwbr how so?
@mcwbr yea, after he was elected. no, not convinced that Nike, M&amp;M's or Bill Gates are taking over our democracy.
@SusannaMatte no, its protecting life, nothing misogynistic about it (absurd) . that its a choice isn't an argument.feminism, irrelevant
@GammaRae206 Oh well that makes all the difference in the world. an exhibitionist,philanderer,rapist and a cheat. no war on women there
@mcwbr it was your claim that billionaires are taking away, or cld take away, our democracy. u dn't get Obama if that's true or blue states
@mcwbr I never claimed either.
@mcwbr I know it is. but not absolute. Linda McMahon, Steve Forbes, very wealthy people could not get elected.
@GammaRae206 your made up war on women would not include Weiner, Edwards,Clinton, Spitzer wld it, or is just "GOP"?
@SusannaMatte would it make you feel better if a majority of women legislatures made it illegal?
@GammaRae206 I see, GOP are killers. then that gives you a pass. suppose I said "but that's the GOP choice" wldn't make sense wld it?
@GammaRae206  that a choice is made to extinguish a life is easy to get, you don't get that a life is destroyed,why, because you choose too?
@SusannaMatte @GammaRae206 it's not an opinion that it is life at its earliest stage
@GammaRae206 @SusannaMatte life is taken away whether God exist or not
@mcwbr ..also if these examples are suppose to prove billionaires taking over our democracy, then they are ineffective tools. prisons? NSA?
@mcwbr I would never think I would sway you with a conservative "real news" web site.
Justice Department has new media monitoring program http://t.co/vDcSIvWkq1 via @examinercom #tcot
@Greytdog @mcwbr no
@mcwbr how did Obama ever get elected with this list?
Step away from these words right now http://t.co/n9xPvmg89H via @examinercom #tcot
@Greytdog @mcwbr can't you guys believe in anything that isn't platitudes?
@mcwbr good, it should be easy for you to answer this then, where is our democracy being usurp by a billionaires?
@reidhoffman working on a project I believe you would be interested in. can we communicate?
@mcwbr they can? is it happening now?
@LiberallyLiving you don't have to answer that. just seems that he says things his followers defend w/o thinking critically
@LiberallyLiving good, the answer is no. if existing laws are in place for his agenda, why aren't they working now?
@LiberallyLiving none. unless this is what you want him to do. is this what you want him to do?
@LiberallyLiving you still refuse to answer the question. why? u know his "agenda" requires new laws. EO doesn't create laws.
@aterkel @caitlinmacneal someone finally gets it right
@Xultar I can't believe ATL would be equipped with sanding trucks and tire chains, enough to get the job done, much less the organization
@BarackObama first lets get em some work. 94 million are out. cart before the horse?
@Xultar you can't get on the expressway when your in a building, they first have to exit. tell em, or do you want me to do it?
@CourageCampaign I read it. why use the term "inequality"? certainly policies are needed for self-sufficiency. your prescription is not that
@dmcrane @HuffPostPol I wouldn't be either. what does that tell you?
@CourageCampaign  but what does that mean? are we supposed to all make the same money?
@mcwbr well I'm trying to not pretend that you have a point. you may have, I just want to get to what ur saying. answer the question.
@mcwbr but computer to computer started with Zerox. anyway, how does a billionaire threaten democracy. does he break laws?
@LiberallyLiving not what I asked you. is he going to legislate from the white house and is that okay with you?
@LiberallyLiving certainly he can't be saying he's going to legislate from the white house, is that what you want him to do?
@sallykohn @Delta that's when you're at your best
@LiberallyLiving @NARNfan no, just clarification.is he admitting he can't work with congrss like all other prez had.just wht dz bypass mean?
@LiberallyLiving @NARNfan that he will "bypass" congress. EO don't do that, they are alterations of existing law, not new ones
@mcwbr how so? don't they produce high speed computers, social netwrks, smart phones, all tools that strengthen democracy?
@GovMalloyOffice if normal circumstance require a fund for manufactures to succeed, perhaps normal circumstances are lousy
@mcwbr  everyone makes different wages, don't understand what this new issue is after
@mcwbr sounds like redistribution
@BillMoyersHQ another Obama success story
@LiberallyLiving @NARNfan fine, why does he have to advertise it?
@Soxwriter @Slate blame global warming
@realDonaldTrump clean yes, I don't think air could be beautiful
@elyse4design correct, then they extract. but supply is key. joe dismissed this dynamic. doesn't matter who gets the oil
@elyse4design report says some zones were changed because of cooling, did you see that?
@elyse4design right. then they extract. they have rights to fields etc. with options, they exercise or they wait, or not at all
@elyse4design no, it is. but when prices fall, extraction becomes too expensive
@elyse4design warming is a good thing. if it were getting colder, then we worry
@elyse4design @joewo when oil goes up, more oil makes it go down. this is rudimentary.
@elyse4design @joewo the opposite is true
@joewo @elyse4design if he's stund then you should be too. what can I tell him.
@joewo @elyse4design nothing is sold for "whatever they want" nothing
@joewo @elyse4design   listen to yourself. first the minister knows supply and demand is irrelevant then he says he's stund, which is it?
@joewo @elyse4design well he's wrong, what can I tell you
@joewo  supply and demand, you know, the very thing you are denying.
@elyse4design let me help you. talk about climate change when it's a little warmer out. don't embarrass yourself
@joewo @elyse4design fine, if prices are artificially high then expect a crash, the other explanation is devalued currency
@elyse4design  either go after the argument or go after me.
@joewo yea for a summer, then they say they could not find an expert to answer the overall question, as though the answer is a mystery
@joewo your fixated on china. if they use this oil they will not use other oil that we use. it doesn't matter which oil and to whom.
@elyse4design @joewo leaks are a legitimate concern. other than that, nothing bad about more oil
@joewo you're attempting to appeal to authority doesn't work. more supply always lowers prices, always.
@joewo come on, did you even read the article, it doesn't say what you state
@joewo I don't know. but when there is a glut, newer pipelines become fewer
@joewo unless there is another alternative, I see no problem
@joewo your not listening. it adds to world supply. we get it even though we don't get it directly out of the same pipeline
@joewo if they get that oil, then they won't use other oil sources, which means others have it, like us. we don't get it but we still get it
@joewo stand corrected again. unless there are better means, pipelines are the only way to go
@joewo tar sand thing I know nothing about. but leaks, not likely at all
@joewo but if it adds to world supply then it affects world prices, prices WE pay. so if we don't get THAT oil, we still get cheaper oil
@joewo ...but what is the reason to stop it?
@joewo it doesn't matter who it goes to directly, it adds to aggregate supply. There is no reason to stop it.
@elyse4design @brianbeutler so are my looks. don't make fun of that too
@joewo apparently there isn't enough supply. bring in the pipeline
@joewo if they have no relation, that answers your previous question
@joewo it isn't
@joewo it isn't. are you arguing against the efficacy of supply and demand?
@elyse4design @brianbeutler I don't let just any lib on that list, you have to behave
@joewo it doesn't matter. the point is increase supply lowers price overall. this is good for school budgets, hospitals, etc.
@elyse4design @brianbeutler fine, why is he an indictment on all white people?
@joewo even so, supply is increased no matter who buys it.
@joewo but if they're greedy, they'll sell it to anyone who has the money to buy it, and they'll do just that
@Meryl333 @nprnews @NPR @ANGAus @EnviroAction happy new year ya beanstalk liberal
@joewo increase supply
@elyse4design @brianbeutler what are you doing to "take responsibility" you guys could be so absurd
@joewo you're right. I like it even more
@DAKGirl @ABCPolitics but #tcot wins all the time. poor libs, not much gets you guys excited
@esd2000 @cathymcmorris no, just the facts
@jim4137 if they know it, why would they want to do that?
@penny_bernath @ShoeRebelle @GovernorDeal no, maybe with warming on the way, no need to be prepared for ice storms.
@esd2000 @cathymcmorris no, I caught you. this isn't about conservatives. stop being a shill to power, think for yourself.
@esd2000 @cathymcmorris no, you're wrong. and stop pretending you have "facts"
@Auriandra  why would anyone doubt this could happen?
@brianbeutler why?
@Spectricide oh fine, someone did. just make sure you follow along, don't forget anything
@Spectricide sure, you would be talking about the absurd "inequality" all on your own if Obama hadn't invented the issue
@howardfineman all it takes is a speech for you guys. 94 million out of work, he can't pass a bill and he's mr wonderful
@Spectricide war on inequality? the hive mentality of you guys is amazing
@CAPAction @SenRandPaul @secupp if that's the case then what would be the argument for raising the wage to $25 an hour?
@PegsKatzencats give the IRS some time
@TPM non-starter. notice this guy hasn't passed a bill since his first year in office. think anything will change that?
@esd2000 @cathymcmorris after ObamaCare more people lose insurance than signed up for it. "lifetime caps"? please
@penny_bernath @ShoeRebelle @GovernorDeal Georgia thought the science was settled on warming and let their guard down
@donnabrazile @washingtonpost you tell em Donna, 94 million out of work can attest to that, the nerve
@SusannaMatte if abortion did not take the life of a baby then you would have a point.
@Notayot @SenatorBoxer no, wages are prices that should not be controlled. always lead to shortage/unemployed....always
@skunkt @WestWingReport ....in separate rooms
@TheFreshBrew @CNN @GOP why are their ratings in the tank, can never figure that out
@WhiteHouse like anyone said it couldn't happen
@lizzwinstead @michellemalkin okay, it wasn't funny the first time
@SenatorBoxer 94 million people out of work, or can't participate in "boundless opportunity" how is he "clearly" the leader?
@SenatorBoxer it should be abolished
@katruthe I don't
@lizzwinstead why did he hire her in the first place?
@aterkel the year of the shut down, economy improves. why mention it?

@cody_k  and she's also a lousy dancer, don't leave anything out
@EzKool who won lie of the year?

@Reschzoo come on Bruce, you don't think that wasn't a little over the top?
@raykwong just Chinese?
@Reschzoo fair? if we're like rapists and Nazi's you think all we need to be is "fair"? is that all we lack?
@BillMoyersHQ @neiltyson that's because today, the powers that be, you know the people u guys love, are running the show
@Reschzoo we're that bad eh? good to know that a white guy knows what's best for a black guy to think and do

@LisaToddSutton here I am: abolish minimum wage and rename the jobs bill then vote it down
@katruthe never! and its anti-abortion not the ridiculous "anti-choice"
@Politics_PR too many ppl in politics havnt thought through the arguments they believe. seems they picked sides first,reason later if ever
@EgbertoWillies oh stop it. can't you accept that sometimes frauds could be liberals too? do u feel u have to defend her bc she's a liberal?
@SarahKSilverman he can't make, I'll go instead
@Politics_PR  my party lacks talent in govt but not in media, the other side it's just the opposite. but I'm as consrvt as they come,u sure?
@helixion12 we have hud, that's enough. reo's are a lot of work, asset managers require endless bpo's and other paper work
@addictionguy I see, a guy in the government is blaming opposition media of "propaganda" nothing wrong with that picture, right?
@Politics_PR a guy here just wrote "David Brooks hates the poor".David Brooks? ppl should talk to the other side and just ask wht they think
@helixion12 lots of short sales
@helixion1 it's becoming about 40-45 days but only if a listing isn't short sale and can be sold at market price.
@Politics_PR there is no rationale to that position. that people are poor bc they don't work hard enough? it isn't conservatism or sound
@Toure it's a useless statistic
@helixion12 awful, I have an idea wr going to execute in march: a kiosk at the mall, tv screens, listing on slideshows, agent manning it
@CarnieWilson that my children are grown up and my wife left me, now I can have chips a hoy and milk for dinner, so quiet
@rcooley123 @Bob_Casey why stop there, why not make it $25 an hour, can you think of an argument against that?
@helixion12 I don't have much money thanks to real estate market so my girl just calls me daddy
@Politics_PR its a foolish proposition to believe. I think it's self-serving to think we believe this.
@helixion12 good ron. you think the term "uncle sugar" will catch on?
@Politics_PR why pay attention to a poll that ask people what they think other people are thinking? then u think its proof of something
@helixion12 you keep a neat ledger. it must have taken awhile for you to balance out weiner.
@Politics_PR a poll with a loaded question. innovative.
@sqeptiq uncle sugar?
@OFA_CT right at a time when people are losing insurance, you can never win
@kathygriffin condolences, sorry to hear
@StephenKing also how cell phones have not made communication more efficient in soap operas
@alfranken I remember you used to talk about access to mortgages. you wr funny then.
@tavlesh but you guys are doing a good job of making less working folks for us to do our evil deeds.
@DeepakChopra I don't know about that. I was sad once and had a cheeseburger and felt much better. that counts for something
@cdashiell nah you need my help, you do. I'm starting to feel sorry for you
@Rickstersays say that again I didn't hear it
@cdashiell can't you see in that article it says she was a single mom who worked her way to college and then later says something else?
@Rickstersays well your facts are wrong, what can I tell ya
@Rickstersays wrong
@cdashiell trying to help you chris, lead you out of the darkness
@Rickstersays  a third of the population isn't working. gee what's that thing about failure you mentioned?
@cdashiell I don't know off hand. certainly there are people with integrity. bad apples bring u down.it isn't all about "wing nut" reactions
@cdashiell that's another thing. you should see what conservatism is and not accept what other liberals tell you they are (tall order)
@cdashiell mistake, certainly there are better Dems you can support, frauds like this one hurt whatever cause you guys think you have
@cdashiell genocide, threat to neighbors, supported terrorism. nah, your right, he should have stayed in power, hey I'm convinced
@cdashiell sure, good to see some kind of reasoning, the point was knowing some1 who died in a particular war is not an argumnt against it
@cdashiell my original point. I don't root for people, it's principles. u r the opposite. no one can do no wrong to you:davis,Obama the liar
@cdashiell ok we're all liars, fine. hey how's your health insurance going?
@cdashiell wrong again, wmd was recognized by Clinton, Kerry, the other Clinton. he used them on his people, looking to get more. THINK!
@cdashiell I must have missed something here, was that supposed to be a convincing argument. if some1 I knew died in WWII, bad idea?
@cdashiell I don't see ur point on this one
@cdashiell .....but that a Republican ousted him, that made getting rid of him a bad thing. come on. stop and following and use ur head
@cdashiell use reason, saddam had  lost his legitimacy to run a country, genocide, threat to neigbors, supported terror......
@cdashiell "they didn't find any" did they need too? he used them to slaughter thousands of kurds and shia, was that all forgiven?
@cdashiell "trolling"  "phony"  since we're on adjectives what is it called when someone resorts to name calling when arguments fail?
@cdashiell...but don't let that small detail deter you from parroting the tired old party line, keep going.
@cdashiell WMD wasn't a lie, small footnote to the grand scheme, however we knew he had them bc he used them for genocide
@cdashiell hit a nerve, that means I must of won. next!
@cdashiell democratic elected leader with a parliament and judiciary, sure miss saddam though and was lookng forward to hz sons taking over
@cdashiell ...fine, you see no problem, liberal reassured you this was all a sexist attack, u believe it. that's how u guys stay liberal
@cdashiell ....that this is a "sexist" attack is a remarkable statement. davis was not a single mom who worked hr way thr ivy league edu
@cdashiell gee a liberal article making a liberal case. are you proving my point, certainly it doesn't counter it.
@cdashiell I'm not a conservative bc conservatives r swell people,I didn't pick my label my principles proximate it.I won't defend christie
@QUINTIX256 @MarkSanford honor above all considerations
@cdashiell certainly we have a bunch, it isn't about bookeeping, the point is why defend a fraud just bc the fraud is on our/your side?
@jazgar but be careful, don't jump or run
@JohnTShannon @MinnPost why is dolphin slaughter bad and say fishing for tuna not bad, or crap lobster fishing?
@addictionguy must be bad, just hope he isn't 12 or something
@addictionguy pos is a little strong, no?
@ishtarmuz Thanks I noticed your tweet.
@Spectricide @EWErickson I see, guess that makes it ok to cheer on frauds and liars. as long as they're on your political side, its ok
@ishtarmuz sorry, looking back I may have read you wrong
@Spectricide @EWErickson I can't reduce Democratic party any more than that.
@Spectricide @EWErickson Communism of course...just kidding, the cause of the Democratic party. are all frauds welcome regardless?
@ishtarmuz your practicing one of them now. and since you can't fathom any rights not intact, therefore we shld regulate the internet???
@Spectricide @EWErickson why root for her, can't you see she does more damage to your cause?
@occupy whatever happen to you guys, I thought you were gone for good?
@j03_2 no, her second husband was an attorney she didn't get money from anyone's attorney
@cdashiell never heard of him, but once he lies, you can have em. you can keep wendy davis, defend her, etc. why? bc we have Louis whomever?
@ishtarmuz who has a basic right that is being taken away?
@ishtarmuz if u don't want to use money or banks that's fine, some of us will not follow. good luck on a date.
@cdashiell don't know him
@sevenish wow, if the quote is correct she's demonstrably wrong. not for the lily ledbetter law, but thr is no rationale to her statement
@ishtarmuz govt regulations of the internet is not freedom, stick to the subject
@cdashiell @WendyDavisTexas that could be true but she did lie about her bio. can't u guys jettison bad apples on ur team?
@j03_2 no, she broke up with her second husband when she finished school, I don't know about alimony, what's the relevancy?
@sevenish you said conservatives say women should be paid less, well, name one
@j03_2 actually no, but what we all know is she did not work her way through college, her husband, attorney, paid for it.
@sevenish name one who said this
@geoff9cow @anamariecox @guardian governments can lock us up in prisons and go to war, companies, what's the worse they can do?
@Emperor_Bob wishful thinking
@ishtarmuz but we do need banks. the rest of ur response was incomprehensible, try again
@j03_2 @BuzzFeedAndrew she lied, she was not a single mother working her way through school,sure she was single between marraiges
@ishtarmuz they may or may not, but they will do so at their peril. we dn't need regulation for internet freedom
@sevenish you shouldn't, but getting to your hashtag, isn't it objectively wrong to take a life regardless if there is a God or not?
@rcooley123 ...which means the law itself is completely unnecessary

@helixion12 oh brother, you and your option arms, I'll catch you tomorrow
@helixion12 I'll answer your next stuff tomorrow. just read the link, I read yours and in fact nothing uv said is in the Nation piece
@helixion12 I don't know and it doesn't matter because those instruments were rare. Option Arms, we're talking about option arms now?
@helixion12 zero, that makes no sense
@helixion12 then there's no excuse for you. your allowing your ideology dictate what is real and what isn't. greed is a absurd answer
@helixion12 Try this http://t.co/SL4hHdVB6M
@helixion12 yea okay, all of a sudden a bunch of people decided to be greedy all at once. read the forbes article will ya
@helixion12 no, trust me you're wrong, you keep shifting cause and effect. this subject is beyond the scope of ur knowledge
@helixion12 alright don't steal my stuff, read the Forbes article
@helixion12 it was a govt sponsored housing bust http://t.co/kl6IN3jxwQ
@helixion12 one of the two things that got it all started. no such thing as "no doc" or "BC" loans before govt suit and regulation
@sevenish I said if it's violence then it's wrong, if not, then what is it?
@helixion12 .....that required lending institutions to lend out to people with sub-par credit. this is all new to you, ur learning something
@helixion12 wrong, Bank of Boston was sued by fed govt late 90's for "red lining" after that enforced community developmnt regulations......
@sevenish if aggressive harassment means preventing someone from entering or violence then its wrong,if not,then I don't know wht that means
@helixion12 a lot of products are gone because of new regulations
@helixion12 no, mortgage crashed because of regulations that forced banks to lend to bad credit borrowers
@sevenish Obstructing someone from going somewhere is wrong and violence is wrong. Protesting is a right, a free speech one at that
@helixion12 I see we're greedy.
@sevenish well that's not a right. no one has the right to stop someone from going someplace.
@sevenish first of all a destination has its designation expired when someone walks away from it. disruption is the point of protest, no?
@sevenish boy are you testy. the question is can govt be allowed to tell people they can't protest in certain places
@helixion12 I was and am a Realtor. That's another sweeping statement. what mortgagors did comply with was a regulations to make bad loans
@sevenish well, that's a good point. I don't agree someone "can't walk away" but maybe those polllng laws are flawed as well
@helixion12 sweeping judgements. they abused "compliance"? people ignored "compliance" doesn't make sense
@sevenish there is no such thing, if someone doesn't want to be lectured, they walk away. but lecturer has the right to do his thing
@helixion12 compliance to more regulations, now were talking. so compliance is at the heart of the slow market, is that the argument?
@helixion12 right "bad risk", is bad risk the only business out their? no. they never lent to bad risk except when they were forced to
@CoryBooker @ryasef why do you need a law or a regulatory body for internet freedom? you guys have this backwards or perhaps Orwellian
@helixion12 "banks aren't lending" no, that's their function, it's the nature of their existence.
@helixion12 no, they're in the risk business,they know how to measure it. thr is no "afraid" of anythng. Nation article doesn't suggest this
@DaveTKoenig FCC making rules for the internet, or any other government entity is a horrible idea. no, you're wrong
@cdashiell they happen to be on the right side of this
@helixion12 article wrongly assumes banks are deliberately refusing to lend money because of rates and term.

@jillosopher @capecodgurl I've never seen any of them run. what we do know is conn GOP is horrible and loaded with moderates.
@jillosopher @capecodgurl but is it only GOP moderates, not Dem's?
@jillosopher @capecodgurl I don't think the country is more liberal. but moderates are not a winning element
@jillosopher @capecodgurl I think they do. Connecticut is loaded with this sort, it's a losing no-ideology ideology. they can't get elected
@capecodgurl @jillosopher just because they don't pin themselves to anything doesn't necessarily mean common sense

@DrPhil come on. we say yes when it comes to doing bad things. you're way off
@gcpropertymanag @UKProgressive this is democracy. a bill no one wants sends legislatures to repeal it. legislatures doing peoples bidding
@UKProgressive @FeetCandy no, it's democracy at work. 2010 midterms allowed unpopular policy to be repealed.
@HarveyLevinTMZ  he assaults someone and it is not in self-defense and you're suggesting he may be on the right side of the incident?
@morgfair this is the result of government planning the direction of markets and lives
@piersmorgan @NRA taking your rationale, why not ban automobiles for the same reason?
@UKProgressive @FeetCandy good to know the guy in charge can't get the things he wants passed. still you love him. that's a cult for ya
Hillary is like awesome, the best ever, omg http://t.co/JFlT6btAXx via @examinercom #tcot
@UKProgressive @FeetCandy original point: under Obama, more jobless more poverty. rant all you want about conservatives wr not in charge
@FeetCandy @UKProgressive funnily?
@Mruff221 you guys are obsessed over these people
@cody_k ..first article details demographics, Forbes 2006 study predicts it. both valid. Keynesian or Fed stimulus r not wealth creators
@cody_k the previous link you cited was more detailed. target number is likely 30m people. fed stimulus ineffective. policy is the key, no?
@morgfair bad deal, horrible
@UKProgressive no question, ur a cheerleader of an ideology regardless of disasterous results, pretty much what a cult follower would do
@UKProgressive @chemoelectric and I bet you were saying economy wld be hurt by GOP this year, right? what happened with that?
@UKProgressive @chemoelectric no, you've managed to spell out failure and portray it as success. nothing you said holds water, laughable
@UKProgressive @chemoelectric your bored, that makes two of us. I bet when economy was growing at 18% u wr disappointed, nah, not a cultist
@UKProgressive @chemoelectric What's "Asia pivot" now your just making things up. Pell Grant expansion, it expands every single year
@UKProgressive @chemoelectric race to the top? more money spent. I see no positive results here. oh, spying on allies, that's bring us back?
@UKProgressive @chemoelectric growth at 4% after three years of his agenda blocked. ought this be a plus for obstructionism? next
@UKProgressive @chemoelectric Wall Street reform? Dodd Frank ensures only big banks get to play. that's reform?
@UKProgressive @chemoelectric Stimulus? that's an achievement? "shovel ready jobs"-----92 million out of work. please.
@UKProgressive @chemoelectric hc reform? that has been a major liability for him, lied, people losing insurance. web site, come on
@jjcrocket "I seen this videoo on fb of u.. wtf, copy and paste in ur browser and search ur name http:///xxxxxx" you sent this
@jjcrocket  I believe ur account was hacked, I don't believe you meant to send me DM, correct?
@chemoelectric @UKProgressive I could use a mustache but I'm ok
@UKProgressive @chemoelectric bet u poor souls can't name one thing that turned out well under your great leader
@chemoelectric @UKProgressive 92 million out of work under the watch of your hero. you guys are like a cult following this guy.
@UKProgressive  nice trick, put liberals in charge and when they run it to the ground blame the opposition.
Why Christie may have orchestrated Bridgegate  http://t.co/kXhVgwBsto via @examinercom #tcot
@UKProgressive yea "huh?" more people out of work and in poverty with your guy Obama. Conservatism produces opposite results. comprehend?
@cody_k ...for that there has to be new wealth, wealth creation. the problm is the fixation on current wealth mobility.
@cody_k that's right. pop about 310 mll. what's considered full employmnt is 4-5 like you said. what's needed is 300k month 4mil a yr
@cody_k  baby boomers and students,article suggest, make up about 60 million. for 30 million,if trend continues (2 milln a year) still bleak
@bluejaygunnyon so what. not a conservative, wouldn't have won in 16. hope this damages him and I also believe he ordered the jam
@cody_k no, I have no problem with TP article, no reason it isn't correct. but there is a greater context missing
@cody_k the labor force is 6.9% out of work, the other 22% have left the "labor force" that is to say, gave up.
@bluejaygunnyon Conservatism is, not Christie
@cody_k no, not labor force rates, the number of total people out of work
@cody_k .....we're talking about a third of the population without a job if a revision is 38k or even double that, it's not even a rounding
@cody_k  that's fine go over the mundane world of revisions but those revisions, even upward, are a small amount compared to ppl out of work
@bluejaygunnyon I agree.
@cody_k I don't have labor figures, I have theirs and 92 million is a third of the population. that's too much. your parsing 10k or so, why?
@bluejaygunnyon It seems to me he managed the bridge just fine.If he wants to close lanes, he just does it. that's not mismanagement
@bluejaygunnyon well, not quite but then again I don't remember all of it. good to know someone is paying close attention to my arguments.
@bluejaygunnyon I didn't. Nothing I said on Obama (obviously your hero) had anything to do with NJ. If u want to discuss NJ, let's have it
@cody_k @TPEconomy Same report: 92 million out of work, that's a third of the population. Is thinkprogress sugar coating this fact?
@bluejaygunnyon Jay, we were discussing another issue, if you want to debate Christie bring it. Are we supposed to only talk about Christie?
A third of the US population is out of work, why this is a success http://t.co/plc0dkmD0b via @examinercom #tcot
@linnyitssn I can't defend morons nor will I ask you to. we can't be held accountable to the fringes
@bluejaygunnyon certainly I would never dodge any issue, if you want input or a say on Christie, lets have it.
@bluejaygunnyon @linnyitssn ....that didn't come out right
@bluejaygunnyon @linnyitssn an issue sure, I see no reason to ignore it or discuss it
@IbSkeeAlii thanks, just wish I didn't have a misspelling in that.
@IbSkeeAlii  you ought to RT my response, no?
@bluejaygunnyon @linnyitssn actually no.
@mattyglesias this information is a little late
@JennyMcCarthy solipsism
@DeepakChopra unless it's steak for dinner with ice cream and cherries for desert. overeating, yes, happy? yes yes and more yes
@UKProgressive by reducing it. GOP has a better record of this. in fact your guy Obama hz increased it. "party of the rich" that's just dumb
@ezraklein when someone pleads the 5th it's because they don't want to answer a damaging question, such as, did your boss know?
@linnyitssn I don't know what a monkey avi is but thanks for the complement, but you do carry well in discussions
@linnyitssn  are we looking at guests now? they have hosts that are liberals, should I berate them the same reason as you?
@linnyitssn I don't like Christie and called him "Joey Bottoms" just to make fun of him. even I'm guilty some times
@linnyitssn but with all the years following politics, it really is not unique. Al Gore called Prez Bush a  predator. what was that?
@linnyitssn no one on Fox said Kenyan terrorist. and let's please not pretend Bush did not meet with much animosity ":war criminal" etc.
@linnyitssn either claim is baseless, or,  unfalsifiable. thats the problem of your argument
@BarackObama amazing how the the presidency has been reduced to an insurance office
@linnyitssn policies and performance are behind it. certainly you don't think they would let up on him if he were white?
@ChrisMurphyCT @MayorHarp hope you mentioned it will all be under water like you said it would be along with bridgeport and nyc
@katruthe 92 million out of work, ya think ppl should be worried?
@linnyitssn reported it. if it were the opinion ppl it varies, if he were rino-like in policies, criticized. those pragmatic, only been 1yr
@MarioLopezExtra @SarahPalinUSA what a good guy
@linnyitssn because since the 80's the number was so low that no one cared. I don't mean to give a coup de gra answer, but its the truth
@linnyitssn no no no. specific request were made and turned down. no one answers who turned it down nor why, are you curious?
@linnyitssn because the measurement is predicated on people "in the work force" not percent of population, number gives context
@rickygervais what's worse is that he does think he makes a lot of sense
@TheEllenShow or put a gate across two lanes so that traffic could back up...oh, they did that
@linnyitssn the point is,there is enough to criticize here whether u agree or not. to suggest racism, that's just, I don't know,unthinking?
@linnyitssn ...plus spying on phones of Associated press, lying about health care and on and on. come now, partisanship can't blind u
@linnyitssn 92 million is a lot of people,that figure came out today. bc is non-issue.with embassy deaths,why did they turned down security?
@thinkprogress I thought it was Bush's fault?
@linnyitssn they didn't have 92 million out of work
@TheOnlyEdAsner @SpikeTV @hippykid if it were discovery he would get hit by an asteroid, they looove showing asteroids
@mark_wahlberg @extratv will he be by himself?
@CitizenWonk @politicususa that's because there are 92 million out of work not 110 million which is worse.
@DrPhil sometimes people don't know what they are doing and do a great job doing it.
@ChelseaClinton didn't need a study for that.
@linnyitssn could be a lot of things. are you suggesting any criticism of Obama is automatically racist?
@EricBoehlert people out of work and for a long time to come? who's in charge anyway?
@DeepakChopra what is that, advise on being Batman?
@Politics_PR dam, we were trying to fight this war without a lot of publicity
@Xistnt @FoxNews I'm sure that won't stop you from keeping your eyes peeled
@linnyitssn stick to your guns, if just some, why not the whole institution that allows it?
@linnyitssn that must mean they're all racist there. smart. you come up with that conclusion all by yourself?
@NickKristof any good deals?
@DonnieWahlberg or ditch the whole want part altogether
@BarackObama why are they having tough times under your watch?
@BarackObama now if only I can sign up and get one

@AntarianRani okay I'll google why does Ima think everyone but white people are oppressed. you have platitudes, nothing to back thm up
@knoxkp not true, there is a direct correlation with high GDP and low unemployment.
@knoxkp actually yes, unemployment reached down to 4.1%
@knoxkp I'll catch up with you tomorrow
@knoxkp conservative guy doesn't translate to conservative principles
@knoxkp it was only better, not good. not as good as the next 3 to 5 years after he left and pails in comparison to 83-2006
@knoxkp right 3% GDP does not create jobs, beyond that it certainly does, absolutely
@knoxkp only in comparison to the awful Roosevelt years, they were only better economic times but not good. 2.2% stinks
@knoxkp Eisenhower's economy never grew past 2.2% GDP in any given year. How is that effective?
@knoxkp economy doesn't work like that. this assumes that wealth is a fixed commodity. it doesn't move from 1 place to another, it's created
@knoxkp ....but shouldnt ur party worry about people being at a job before you argue about what they should make? first things first
@knoxkp living wage is another old argument that goes nowhere.only hardened left wing dems like it.it is price control on labor, never works
@knoxkp that same argument was made in the late 50's. what needs to be done is a policy of wealth creation, we don't have that now
@knoxkp boring article. when you meet a john bircher make sure you bring this up
@knoxkp I feel bad now, I don't know if I should debate you or teach you. you may not be a liberal pending some more thought
@knoxkp exactly what does that mean. the board acts independently it doesn't need "clout"
@knoxkp But she was confirmed today, come on Karl
@knoxkp I liked Bernake. DId not think QE was effective though
@knoxkp ...but I see we agree on Hitchens
@knoxkp monetary policy is not influenced by lawmakers nor the president at all, it is an independent body.
@knoxkp You cite all these higher institutes to claim things are swimmingly well, when I point out things stink, its GOP fault
@knoxkp so after 5yrs Obama, great, you pointed out the economy stinks, good for you. finally you made a coherent point
@knoxkp 5yrs of Obama "...good middle-class jobs anymore.Of the jobs that were created following the 08 crash only 2% wr middle income ones"
@knoxkp after 5 yrs of Obama "The uber wealthy and corps are doing well the middle-class is being shrunk because this economy doesn't create
@knoxkp oh more name calling, that works. talk about echo chamber, you learn that technique from MSNBC. bring an argument will'ya
@knoxkp not repeating anything, many millions out of a job econmy is anemic growth, you have zero to stand on except ur delusional Obamacult
@knoxkp oh boy here we go appealing to higher authority. unemployment right now is miserable economy awful u want to argue over 0.7%???
@knoxkp ...and frankly I don't believe u know how the "jobs bill" is supposed 2 work either.appealing to "institutes" unimpressive,weak
@knoxkp u haven't been right on any of ur points but more telling is ur not able to explain wy u would be right.u don't know how things work
@markabass I know, you're right. my family is filled with them.on a larger point his call wz 4 individuals 2 act a certain way, not Caesar
@AntarianRani not interested? just when I ask u2 explain your point, somehow mysteriously ur not interested. I think u never had an arugmnt
@AlfhelmOff @moronwatch they can have their say
@knoxkp Obama spends 800biln on a "jobs bill" the economy loses 2.5 miln jobs, as you say. but it's the GOP fault. is Obamaism a cult?
@knoxkp no, to what bill are you talking about?
@knoxkp .....and this monetary policy of easement did not work...oooobviously, or is the economy doing well?
@knoxkp Qualitative Easement proceeded on it's own. did not need congress approval. you don't know how things work do you?
@knoxkp he's th only prez in histry 2 get his agenda blocked by congress...and blocked bc he's black.how original. think of tht by yourself?
@knoxkp oh okay, let's appeal to another higher authority. how do you explain that the first jobs bill (or they explain) rise in jobless?
@knoxkp lets look at this. first "jobs act" was over 800biln and unemployment went up. next act was 3.5biln how would THAT work?
@GrodinsToupee @EricBoehlert this is lost on Eric.
@AntarianRani @geoff9cow How so?
@d_m_elms @geoff9cow perhaps you didn't then, I'm mistaken
@moronwatch @AlfhelmOff I would first have to judge and thus undermine the authority to forgive
@AlfhelmOff @moronwatch majority rules
@knoxkp @AlanGrayson I'm not, you still hadn't answered the original question I don't suppose you have an answer anyway
@AntarianRani @geoff9cow who is being oppressed?
@linnyitssn so they have the compassion to wait for warm weather, do they get credit for that?
@moronwatch @AlfhelmOff hey I'm one of those guys, be careful
@helixion12 I put you on a good list of people, hope you don't mind. I disagree with all of them, but a good smart bunch
@auldphartt @ChicoDelainky oh no, I was afraid of that.  just don't apologize at the victory line
@helixion12 Thanks Ron, and I am always ready for a good discussion
@d_m_elms @geoff9cow codifying what you think Jesus would do into law
@geoff9cow @d_m_elms happy new year geoff
@knoxkp @AlanGrayson good to hear you say that because obviously it hasn't been working
@d_m_elms @geoff9cow I wouldn't let that deter you. put it too them, stick to your guns
@auldphartt @ChicoDelainky thanks for keeping score or feel a need to
@d_m_elms @geoff9cow bad fundies
@d_m_elms @geoff9cow but dee, you have no problem forcing others to do the same do you?
@geoff9cow but isn't it in this example? what do you say to it?
@d_m_elms @geoff9cow next time you meet one that's offended make sure you make that point
@geoff9cow @JohnFugelsang but being high does not allow for good decision making. again, of all violent crms, how many use it?
@ChicoDelainky there you go. she was wrong to apologize. but should the left always follow the examples of the right?
@geoff9cow then lets give them credit for not allowing their religious views not interfere with public policy, no?
@geoff9cow @JohnFugelsang also smoke pot, and?
@ChicoDelainky well then she was wrong to apologize, no?
@geoff9cow but the assertion was yours
@geoff9cow @JohnFugelsang I'm sure many, and?
@EWDolan good way to get rid of pot is to make it legal then
@geoff9cow @JohnFugelsang wrong, absolutely strikes at the heart of the point.
@geoff9cow clever quote. doesn't answer the question. but, a prerequisite to membership is sin. so, take that bold guy
@EricBoehlert but at the same time should others on the left apologize for calling Bush a racist. this is not what happened on Perry show
@EricBoehlert Thanks for all your examples. none of which are the same thing as what happened on Perry show. u did not demnstrt dble stndrd
@EricBoehlert if beck's opinion that the prez is a racist, is that racism? would it have been true if the accusation wr made at Bush?
@EricBoehlert Carson had an argument, his very race was attacked by MSNBC host, he defended. how is this an example?
@EricBoehlert this particular instance does not have any relevance to the Perry issue. you disagree with Reed? not the same
@EricBoehlert could he have a point? could zimm have been compelled to act by the looks of Treyvon, wrongly of course,but isn't it a point?
@sevenish broad stroke, some truth to it when markets fail en masse but in normal circumstances this doesn't happen
@sevenish nothing of any consequence.but we can agree that after spending close to a trilln on stimulus and this is a result, stimuls failed
@knoxkp @AlanGrayson what bill would have given opportunity, tax hikes? redistribution? first four years, these things made numbers worse
@EricBoehlert perhaps you ought to cite an example to which they ought to apologize. the problem with MSNBC is one of hypocrisy
@geoff9cow @JohnFugelsang @SteveKornacki @msnbc if Jesus was a Liberal why aren't Liberals followers of Jesus?
@sevenish I see, after 5 years of Dems in power and elderly vet is delivering pizza, it's the fault of the "system", nice trick
@E_Joyce they don't want to mix politics with religion. on this I agree
@davidaxelrod mobility needs wealth creation. Dem party does not focus on that. absent mobility last 5 years shows this
@geoff9cow @JohnFugelsang I wonder what percent all violent criminals never tried pot? you think fewer, more?
@knoxkp @AlanGrayson no jobs bill, GOP blocked it along with all other Dem agenda. unemployment drops. well, what'ya know
@AlanGrayson defeat the likes of people like yourself
@EWDolan you misread that article
@E_Joyce but by blocking Dem policies, how do we account for unemployment dropping, economy growing. certainly not Dem doings
@BillMoyersHQ I see, Dems never get elected with big pocket support, redistricting nor do they enact their agenda. come on.
@knoxkp gee if the DailyKos says so then it must certainly be true
@jayrosen_nyu or when its 89 but the humidity makes if "feel" like 98
@EzKool it couldv been worse, he couldv married his intern
@paeznyc what if the answer were 'because with the GOP, I want a policy that gets us working, not a prolonged handout'?
@YatPundit you violated that rule by bringing it up
@WhiteHouse how do you account for all those Dems that voted to join the GOP?
@YatPundit as long as we're not selective on the things we ignore on the behalf of the 99. right?
@YatPundit oh ok, let's ignore it then.

@mattyglesias the scandal is that there are no jobs and less that the benefits expire
@cdashiell after all POTUS is doing a great job and everything is just fine and dandy
@geoff9cow @penny_bernath that's an absurdity that doesn't prove ur point. seeing a pattern
@geoff9cow @penny_bernath ...and my shoe shine box too?
@geoff9cow @penny_bernath you left out automatic weapons. the point is if they were illegal, then only criminals will have them, against us
@geoff9cow @penny_bernath because I like you guys
@geoff9cow @penny_bernath only in criminal hands, not responsible ownership. restricting them only means crminals will have them
@geoff9cow @NRA it does? I disagree
@geoff9cow good, you do that. but don't think that because that's what you would do is just fine for others
@dvabtcha7 you have to ask her. as I recall their freedom wasn't attacked just the dumb thing the lead singer said. try again
@geoff9cow @penny_bernath no they don't. u say they do but as in every lib argument this is wrong too
@geoff9cow @penny_bernath that's already illegal, suppose we make a law that if you break the law, it's against the law?
@geoff9cow @NRA @GOP restricting freedom whenever there is a problem (in everything, not just guns) is what u guys do,OUR interests
@penny_bernath @geoff9cow owning an automatic weapon is not an arsenal
@geoff9cow @penny_bernath no, that's ur job
@geoff9cow @NRA no one wants more deaths in blue states. you have this habit of equating arguments u don't agree with with absurdity
@geoff9cow 1000% of the time you give good lib arguments. but "just step on the pedal" is absurd
@penny_bernath @geoff9cow but it doesn't jeopardize it either
@penny_bernath @geoff9cow  no, you don't regulate freedom. you can strike that maxim. but gun ownership is properly regulated on state level
@geoff9cow @NRA @GOP people like me who 10 dollaraires
@penny_bernath @geoff9cow next time you find an extremists make sure to bring this up
@geoff9cow @NRA ridiculous. not being for the federal govt having background checks is the SAME as wanting more dead people in blue states?
@geoff9cow ooooooh okay, just accelerate the pedal. how about if we construct motes with alligators around our homes
@geoff9cow @NRA next time you run into a billion dollar Republican, bring it up and then chastise them
@penny_bernath @geoff9cow the act of owning an automatic weapon is not by definition irresponsible
@geoff9cow @NRA on a state level, not federal.
@geoff9cow so it's a bad idea to defend ourselves against someone trying to break into our car when we're in them?
@penny_bernath @geoff9cow what is your disagreement? what is "common sense"?
@geoff9cow correct, no one is against that
@geoff9cow yes but to the point where it wld be a bad idea if more people wr defending themselves against car jacking? that ws the point
@TheFreshBrew @rushlimbaugh @GOP do you actually listen to Rush's show?
@geoff9cow cars=death too
@geoff9cow no, responsible ownership, same with cars.
@penny_bernath @geoff9cow as well we should and that ought to be the way with guns. but we should have the right to defend ourselves
@TheFreshBrew @rushlimbaugh the answer is no and if he did he would be wrong too
@geoff9cow no, I agree with Trumps original point, that's what we wr talking about.
@geoff9cow I didn't say that, neither did Trump. stay on topic
@j03_2 they better hurry
@geoff9cow not a reason to disallow proper use and the right to defend. same reason we shouldn't ban cars
@TheFreshBrew @BashirLive I know the point, but if for instance you had made light of Holocst, it wld be improper to say u shld be gassed
@geoff9cow @realDonaldTrump no, it's a proper way of defending oneself and family ya lib. Merry Christmans Geoff
@TheFreshBrew @BashirLive Bashir and myself disagree, it wasn't just criticism
@TheFreshBrew oh stop. Bashir criticism was passable to you? I won't provide endless links of others, don't you think I could?
@66Betty drats
@TheFreshBrew @BashirLive what he said was beyond the pale, come on. I wouldn't mind if he was still on the air, but it was indefensible

@ChrisMurphyCT @AccessHealthCT what happens after that date, for those that don't sign up, are they "illegals"?
@TheFreshBrew no, I like to debate and criticize, I count on it. a lot of people say dumb things. your side does it too
@TheFreshBrew sure that's over the top. but if I said my grandchildren are going to be a "slave to the national debt" that isn't the same
@TheFreshBrew @BashirLive @SarahPalinUSA I don't mind. it's just that an "idiot" has gotten to you, struck a nerve
@TheFreshBrew okay, I guess some have made that poor analogy. it doesn't fit and like Bashir, bad taste
@TheFreshBrew @SarahPalinUSA but she resonates quite a bit with you to the extent of mentioning her here.
@TheFreshBrew but that would not be an analogy and no one to my knowledge had done that, you just made that up
@TheFreshBrew @DuckDynastyAE I didn't
@TheFreshBrew @SarahPalinUSA the hatred some of you guys have for her is astounding. by ur admission she's an "idiot" why be afraid?
@TheFreshBrew @SarahPalinUSA  are you pretending that Palin is the only person (left/right) that used the word slavery in an analogy?
@TheFreshBrew @SarahPalinUSA if it's so abhorrent to you than why would you want Palin subject to that treatment, or cheer it on?
@TheFreshBrew @SarahPalinUSA no she didn't. are we not supposed to use the word slavery anymore either?
@TheFreshBrew @SarahPalinUSA right, that isn't the "reality of slavery" is it? that's why he got fired and no wonder his ratings stunk
@TheFreshBrew @BashirLive he was talking about what should be done with Palin, not slavery.I agree with what he said in his apology,u don't?
@TheFreshBrew @BashirLive @SarahPalinUSA putting it lightly. what he said was in horrible taste, not the insult, insults wr normal, evryday
@Greytdog you too grey
@Greytdog don't make a hater out of me

@Greytdog its hard for liberals to live it up while moaning about the underclass at the same time, hi grey
@rcooley123 ...people to hire them. that was easy
@cody_k  ...still, don't see how any of this proves that Reagan is to blame of an economic implosion 30yrs after
@cody_k  I see, your trying to convey that high tax rates are not relevant to growth, right?
@cody_k I have to know why they called those yrs golden, for one, and I also don't know how this explains the Reagan question
@cody_k I couldn't open the link, page error
@cody_k kind of sounds like blaming the economic "malaise" he inherited on Truman. once there is an economic slwdown, we reach back 30yrs?
@cody_k they passed his bills, his agenda. good to see you admit to Reagan's "gains". a slip?

@WestWingReport how convenient

@cody_k I had friendly debates with some on the left that went after you.I'm just wrong or whatever, you wr a heretic to them.nice thg 2b
@cody_k right. I had a dummy account for the express purpose of arguing with cons. some no substance, followers not thinkers
@cody_k ...by accepting and believing in principles. the latter group will always fall into hypocrisy
@cody_k the difference is some people are Lib/consrv because they picked sides and follow and defend thr heros, othrs get thr....

@cody_k I see where your getting at, I wish I could've accommodated. Buckley saw things our way too. I bet not all liberals want weed legal
@cody_k it is not, to me, part of my principles which are in line with conservatism but perhaps not with conservatives.
@cody_k sure, in that given instance. there was always some penalty
@cody_k right. the idea being was if the govt passed a law on how we behave, it would lower cost liability...starting to sound familiar
@cody_k that's fine cdy, tell you what. I won't hold you to all of liberaldom and don't hold me to all of conservadom
@cody_k no, with or without significant numbers, it's a principle of law
@cody_k ....production and more workers, and wealth is created out of an idea, it's created, not made at someone elses expense
@cody_k ...like machine operators, mechanics, secretaries etc.when govt policy is to keep more of what people produce we get more.....
@cody_k so if I want to manufacture transmissions I buy the parts and get assembly machines working to make a profit, that takes help......
@cody_k I'll explain.wealth is not fixed, it's created by ppl putting pieces  together making the whole greatr than the sum of the parts
@cody_k not all. it should be a state matter, not federal
@cody_k in short, a person can be irresponsible but if it leads to the injury of others, the state is compelled to protect.
@cody_k I see, your referring to the metaphor of "trickle down" right?
@cody_k actually yes.
@cody_k this is the error: wealth isn't a fixed quantity that "flows" in a given direction
@cody_k yes,and?
@cody_k actually I can. one big difference is how liberal orthodoxy views wealth, what it is, how it comes into existence
@geoff9cow @JohnFugelsang like who was the smart liberal that hired him in the first place, you guys every explore that? noooooo
@cody_k ....the bigger picture becomes.where does it end.do we close bars, have less boats? totally making life risk free bc some1 might pay
@cody_k yea but it did I can't see why you can't see that, no links, lets stay on topic
@cody_k good, when you find one that does lay it on them :)
@cody_k the market is not working the way normal markets do. cost shifting is greater. something is wrong with the market not ppl behavor
@cody_k cripple is a big word, but lets assume it is. the problem would first have to be identified, the cause, then the fix
@cody_k right, no one can
@cody_k cdy, lets not get into this cbo business.it's not as though they no exactly how to score every single reform &amp; know all contingents
@cody_k correct, all markets work that way. loss is built into the cost of everything
@cody_k no it wouldn't
@cody_k correct. the problem here is not the means to pay that bill but the ridiculous enormous price tag in the first place
@cody_k ....to get more people insured. there were market reforms that could have worked without complete market overhaul
@cody_k when this is a problem, solving it by means of less freedom should not be the option. the other is to find a way.....
@cody_k right, so getting ppl insured is the priority not separate from cutting the cost curve and in fact essential to it
@cody_k you cannot be saying that govt is here to make sure we don't make mistakes in our lives, are you?
@cody_k but how does govt know how to bend the cost curve?
@cody_k ..yes, by virtue of their existence the state is compelling the owner to ensure no harm is done if so, compensation must be rewarded
@cody_k  because responsibility doesn't become personal anymore. the state mandates what is responsible behavior and what is not.
@cody_k yes, predicated that the 30 odd million get insurance, so it would be a priority at least to obtain that goal
@cody_k ....as for the boat marina, I don't know. if someone suffers an accident as a result of negligence, the boat owner I guess pays
@cody_k  so we erode freedom if in any given market there is a cost sharing as a result of non-payers?
@cody_k to insure the uninsured
@cody_k @BradMarston that's true in all markets from electric bills to foreclosures and even shop lifting. do we erode freedom here too?
@cody_k @BradMarston that's an economic transfer, it is not the same as a person compensating for damages he or she caused
@cody_k @BradMarston how is the principle the same?
@cody_k @BradMarston....with health insurance there is no second party causing the injury in the case of illness, disease etc
@cody_k @BradMarston that's where the similarities end. if I cause injury to y bc of my driving, I'm compelled to hv resrce 2 compensate
@geoff9cow @BiIIMurray me, never
@cody_k @BradMarston ....but the biggest difference is state v federal power and then the discussion gets boring
@cody_k @BradMarston driving is a privileged that requires a license to drive a vehicle with the potential to destroy property and lives....
@rcooley123 anytime you guys get all in a tiff about race, someone deserves a raise
@cody_k @BradMarston the problem is govt directs our behavior and that of companies and providers. you can't herd freedom
@cody_k @BradMarston it may have come from a people who are on the "right" but it is not a conservative principle
@BradMarston @cajuncapitalist @cody_k my goal is to change her mind, brad
@Greytdog I did. I gave arguments, they ignored them. did not engage. name calling I didn't mind, but they had to have more than that
@Greytdog if we use the cites definition, the answer is nothing.u can't impose equality without taking property, govt determines what's fair
@Greytdog gee, like to know what was so off putting. frustrating, they refused to come to some common ground, to reason,am I wrong?
@bannerite @IronicPollyana @Greytdog I win again. next
@bannerite @IronicPollyana @Greytdog no you didn't, that's okay. you asked about social justice not the same, u won't even define it
@bannerite @IronicPollyana @Greytdog you have to ask yourselves why it was necessary to not take my arguments head on
@bannerite @IronicPollyana @Greytdog have a good night guys. it was fun,just wish u would address my argument and not dodge. get u next time
@bannerite @IronicPollyana @Greytdog no, I said civil rights. GOP congress in 57 and 64, hey I just gave you a fact, whatya know
@bannerite @IronicPollyana @Greytdog Pat, I have to know what you mean by social justice, to me there is only 1 kind of justice unproviso
@bannerite @IronicPollyana @Greytdog I believe social justice is a subjective label. u have to give me what u consider a social justc issue
@bannerite @IronicPollyana @Greytdog all opinions use facts as a source, we differ on what we make of them. u said u disagreed, why?
@bannerite @IronicPollyana @Greytdog good. you disagreed with my opinion on stimulus, tell me why?
@IronicPollyana @bannerite @Greytdog I made an argument and you don't want to address it? are you dodging it?
@bannerite @IronicPollyana @Greytdog I personally think there is one justice and it's called justice. social justice? give me one issue
@bannerite @IronicPollyana @Greytdog I don't want you to accept anything as fact I just want ur opinion of MY reasoning
@bannerite @IronicPollyana @Greytdog Pat, we can reason this out and come to common ground without endless links, where am I wrong?
@bannerite @IronicPollyana @Greytdog ....that's why stimulus doesn't work, didn't work for FDR, first Bush second Bush or Obama
@bannerite @IronicPollyana @Greytdog .....taking it from the other end is negative, there is no other logical way of looking at it....
@bannerite @IronicPollyana @Greytdog ....for one thing govt has no money, it has our money. so if it gives money and it's positive.....
@bannerite @IronicPollyana @Greytdog Pat, WPA didn't work either. unemplymt was near 20% right until WWII. there's a reason....
@bannerite @IronicPollyana @Greytdog ....as for what O can do going forward and the answer is as little as possible, u can't legislate jobs
@bannerite @IronicPollyana @Greytdog you asked what I attribute for dismal showing, I said uncertainty in the market and why....
@bannerite @IronicPollyana @Greytdog I didn't, you asked for my opinion and I gave it to you.
@IronicPollyana @bannerite @Greytdog but the charts are not
@IronicPollyana @bannerite @Greytdog what they blocked was stimulus packages that don't work. Bush had 2 that failed Obama, 1
@bannerite @IronicPollyana @Greytdog uncertainty. people cannot plan in the long term bc of health care cost.
@bannerite @IronicPollyana @Greytdog http://t.co/GuslnlGAn4
@bannerite @IronicPollyana @Greytdog "That same BLS reprt shws we LOST 5.1 million jobs in 2009. ..can 1million jobs be consdred NEW JOBS?
@bannerite @IronicPollyana @Greytdog 5 years ago. today 90 million out of work. gdp hasn't grown over 2% during th entire time of BO. denial
@Greytdog @IronicPollyana @bannerite "shovel ready jobs" that wasn't us 1trillion stimulus didn't work, wasn't us. nice try. denial
@IronicPollyana @Greytdog @bannerite that doesn't work anymore. 5 years of dismal growth and higher unemployment. ur in denial
@IronicPollyana @Greytdog @bannerite @RepublicanDalek I didn't. you said they were adverse to it. that's incorrect
@Greytdog @IronicPollyana @bannerite unemployment rose under the current regime. not buying it. it's still high
@Greytdog @IronicPollyana @bannerite I agree with that. but when they were denied, GOP changed it. Not Dems or Libs.
@IronicPollyana @Greytdog @bannerite @RepublicanDalek but you failed to make a counter argument just generalizations that I shot down
@IronicPollyana @Greytdog @bannerite .....and do you really really think we want to shoot black people, is that what your saying??
@IronicPollyana @Greytdog @bannerite no one is starving and if the issue is food than it's economic. more people in poverty now under BO
@IronicPollyana @Greytdog @bannerite never heard of it, you have to explain that one
@IronicPollyana @Greytdog @bannerite I criticize a president that happens to be black. is there a certain specific way for that?
@IronicPollyana @Greytdog @bannerite SYG or SNAP are not civil rights issues. Immigration cannot be amnesty, breakg law not civil right
@IronicPollyana @Greytdog @bannerite no we are not. a lot of dem/libs accept what party people say about us and not really look 4 themselvs
@IronicPollyana @Greytdog @bannerite no I didn't, I addressed it head on twice now
@Greytdog @IronicPollyana @bannerite does it matter? GOP gave us civil and voting rights, freed slaves. not Dems not liberals
@IronicPollyana @bannerite @Greytdog not my position. what he goes through is not unique. he's a nice enough guy, that's not my beef
@bannerite @IronicPollyana @Greytdog no, it doesn't work that way. I'm not compelled to prove a negative, it's ur assertion, u make ur case.
@IronicPollyana @bannerite @Greytdog but it is. to say we don't want people to have civil rights is absurd and cast us in a bad light
@bannerite @IronicPollyana @Greytdog that's a good thing, no?
@bannerite @Greytdog @IronicPollyana here's my take: he's not suited for the job regardless of party or ideology he has.
@IronicPollyana @bannerite @Greytdog Bonita that's really more of an ad hominen. Dems say we aren't for civil rights, not true
@bannerite @IronicPollyana @Greytdog not a bad thing. the people are in charge of the votes and if they want tea party GOP I'm all for it
@IronicPollyana @bannerite @Greytdog it's a contentious party, this may be a good thing. primaries purge what people don't want.
@bannerite @Greytdog @IronicPollyana I can't speak for those who r insidious and lie but ths isn't unique for him.what cld Michelle tell us?
@IronicPollyana @bannerite @Greytdog fine. doesn't matter how the deck chairs are rearranged the fact is GOP voted civil and voting rights
@bannerite @Greytdog @IronicPollyana voting with Dems is a vote for conscience? that's self-serving.we have oppositional govt nt good v evil
@bannerite @Greytdog @IronicPollyana that settles it. Obama is beyond reproach
@bannerite @Greytdog @IronicPollyana how convenient
@IronicPollyana @Greytdog @bannerite good night
@Greytdog @IronicPollyana @bannerite it took a majority of GOP in 57 and 64 to pass civil and voting rights against Dem. try again
@Greytdog @IronicPollyana @bannerite I still like the word liberal. the mode doesn't matter. just be right about SOMEthing for once
@Greytdog @IronicPollyana @bannerite both sides a guilty of the same thing.
@Greytdog @IronicPollyana @bannerite there is. with Obama supporters it's like politics started 5 years ago and criticism is unprecedented
@bannerite you're a welcome addition
@bannerite just like with George Bush, Clinton, the other Bush and on and on. it's politics, nothing's changed.
@bannerite  have a sense of humor
@IronicPollyana @Greytdog @bannerite oh don't be so uncritical of PBO.
@Greytdog @IronicPollyana @bannerite thanks grey

@CitizenWonk in closer examination,I can't say I buy the story in the link.some holes here. stage 4? he's okay now? insur reinstated?

@CitizenWonk I'll address this citzy, I'm turning in, good night
@CitizenWonk ...and MSNBC just lost 45% of it's ratings. not related but I liked throwing it in anyway
@CitizenWonk well my link has far more people losing insurance under Obamacare
@CitizenWonk Here is an article, one of many, but it claims far more than 80 million: http://t.co/Mv46WBXn0T
@CitizenWonk I understand the stages, but why the delays?
@CitizenWonk well why is this part of the law being delayed of it doesn't affect most of the ppl? what's the hold up? why after elections?
@CitizenWonk but there are new standards so of course it will affect most employer plans, how can it not??
@CitizenWonk ...and works the opposite of its intentions
@CitizenWonk ok, show a non-Obamacare related article where someones was denied for pre-existing conditions
@CitizenWonk no, insurance was very basic for some and more comprehensive for others. u can't qualify that charge
@CitizenWonk you have to wonder why Dem's up for reelection are distancing themselves from the law. I've yet to see some1 get cheepr isnc u?
@CitizenWonk The WSJ was about an existing condition under treatment and what happened there specifclly was a result of the law
@CitizenWonk  oh then, I stand corrected...boy u read fast
@CitizenWonk This much we know: insurance is more expensive and people are being left without coverage. When (cont) http://t.co/xtrYtBev9W
@CitizenWonk ...now there are estimates that 80mill will be dropped once employer mandate kicks in, if true, what good is the law, altruism?
@CitizenWonk ...what is the point of the law if these practices won't change and people are being dropped from being insured?
@CitizenWonk so no matter what happens as a result of the law, the argument is, nothings changed, it happened before anyway?
FTC cracks down on non-profit piano teaches - http://t.co/rBLKKmSD60 http://t.co/C4XJxIkAfa
@CitizenWonk if in reaction to the law, these things happen, what makes it a good law? ppl being dropped with a CURRENT condition. not good
@CitizenWonk ...minor concession, ok, the whole thing didn't happen b/c a plan was illegal, in retro, it cld be, maybe not. regardless
@CitizenWonk  the overall philisophical point is, just b/c govt directs a market,does not mean ppl and institutions will do what they expect
@CitizenWonk The point is, if not for the law the story in the WSJ would not have happened regardless of the reason. No law, no loss of ins.
@CitizenWonk ...you "get that"? no one thinks that, how can you "get" it? I don't, why would anyone think that?
@CitizenWonk here's a wrong assumption:pple are " philosophically opposed 2 the idea tht healthcare should be affordable &amp; accessible"
@CitizenWonk right! "I suspect these decisions were made because they didn't like something in the law." if not for the law, what then?
@CitizenWonk but the company went out of the California market for reason that would not exist if not for the law.
@CitizenWonk you cannot blame companies and hospitals when they are doing things as a result of the law. they wld not be doing these things
@Greytdog hi grey, good to hear from you
@CitizenWonk ...because of the law
@CitizenWonk ...as a result of the law
@CitizenWonk they are working within the new parameters of the law, the law is responsible for this.
@CitizenWonk no, insurance policies are becoming illegal, the govt is running the market, people losing insurnce and doctrs
@CitizenWonk What do you make of this:  http://t.co/uNWDe0bYnh
@hotcitykitty you must be very proud of yourself for not being GOP
@CitizenWonk ...even if it were Obamacare, would it vindicate that it is a bad policy, certainly u can't expect 100% perfection?
@CitizenWonk even in Texas govt fouls things up.
@Psycholyst more "urban legend" stuff, but stay in denial anyway:http://t.co/JxdIyx6EZO

@mcwbr @balihai2 wrong, you don't get lucky being a billionaire
@balihai2 @mcwbr right. what's the point?
@mcwbr ...but I'm turning in happy thanksgiving mcwbr. when I come back I'm coming after you
@mcwbr for every billionaire there are great new products and gadgets and new ideas. don't hate, think of an idea yourself
@CitizenWonk no I don't
@CitizenWonk I'm having a hard time making u a conservative when you make good arguments, gotta turn it, happy thanksgiving citizenwonk
@CitizenWonk it was a TV news story, I don't remember where it was. insurance was dropped, certainly it happened to ppl in middl of treatmt
@CitizenWonk yes, this can contribute to higher cost but we're talking about less than 10% of the population
@CitizenWonk  I don't have answer. what do want a reference on?
@CitizenWonk I can't defend all the faults of the old system of insurance, my point is cost of medical care is the source of trouble
@CitizenWonk don't doubt that this hadn't happen, don't know about it. but I do know this happened recently with Obamacare
@CitizenWonk by law, no one can be denied medical care
@CitizenWonk ...others unknowingly qualify for medicare. in short, the 30-40 million is transient, never the same group
@CitizenWonk this is over stated. 300 million people with 30-40 million w/out insurance. of those: ppl between jobs, young choosing none....
@CitizenWonk I don't know what the theory is to have an opinion
@CitizenWonk access to care was never an issue. if we can get a handle on the market distortions insurance would not b an issue either
