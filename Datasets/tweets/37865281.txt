Missouri GOP Sen. @HawleyMO tells @BryanLowry3 he's waiting for details on Trump's national emergency: 		"Well, there's all kinds of statutes, I don't know what statute he's thinking of using."
Kansas GOP @SenPatRoberts to @BryanLowry3 on Trump declaring a national emergency to build his wall: 		"I mean If I had my druthers, I just as soon he wouldn't have done that. Maybe he was saying that hopefully prematurely? ... I'm not in charge of the standards of the president"
