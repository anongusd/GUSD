martinez is grinning at chavez; fighting with his hands down (show of disrespect) saying "man you can't do sh#t to me" love this guy
martinez is a southpaw so chavez isn't prepared; his fights have all been chosen for him his entire career so he's not toughen up for this
time for martinez/chavez; chavez is overrated so i'm not surprised martinez is kicking his butt
i can't believe how easy josesito made that for canelo; especially after breaking ortiz' jaw a few weeks ago.
cortez is probably going to stop the fight;
that body shot, the first one, hurt lopez. he went from 100 to 50% with that body punch. and then canelo kept them coming
low blow by canelo
lopez is making this too easy for canelo; time for lopez to go for all he's got
damn.... body shot by canelo put lopez on his ass... damn damn damn
lopez came out hard in 2nd round; but needs to maintain momentum. giving canelo waaayyy too much respect
lopez looks nervous, jittery; canelo is confident; first round alvarez
missing the chavez martinez fight; think chavez is overrated

RT @busyworksport: nobody wanted to Listen to Floyd. it took Pacquiao getting robbed for people to really see what Bob Arum is about.
part of me wanted bradley to knock out manny for making us wait an hour so he could watch the game. but i saw early on that wasnt hap'nen.
bob arum could be behind this. just to get out of the mega fight.
this screws up everything. now mayweather fights bradley OR pacquiao does rematch. and the world waits another year for the super fight
@RealSkipBayless definitely a set up!
maybe the judges were pissed off becuz manny made them wait a whole hour for the fight. betcha he'll treat them differently next time
it would be different if bradley really went out there and fought a good fight. but i was underwhelmed. it's not him, it's the judges
it's not like pacquiao was raising a lot hell tonight. but he won this fight. so now mayweather has to fight bradley. and that's a joke
@BCampbellESPN maybe they'll come back in the morning with the facts.
RT @BCampbellESPN: I don't even think controversial is the right word. I think they just read the wrong scores.
timothy bradley? an unknown virtually until this fight. and now he's the world champ? no EFFING way
@Luvologist trust me. the money team did not see this coming. this effects  mayweather's money too.
RT @rolandsmartin: The two judges who gave this fight to Bradley should be immediately suspended. They shouldn't even get paid for this  ...
corruption AND incompetence!
agreed with teddy atlas. this was corrupt. and was rigged to negate the potential fight with mayweather
what fight were the judges at? 	this was rigged

ali was treated the same way by the media as mayweather and so was jack johnson. it's a damn shame 2011 is the same as 1909! #mayweather
merchant interviews mayweather and asks him to comment on an unreal controversy, taking away from his win, but plays down the headbutt
@JForsstrom did you not hear the ref say, "let's go" & motion hands together? N-E-1 who knows boxing, knows each ref uses specific signals
i'm pissed at the ortiz camp. this was all orchestrated. that's effed up; i really thought he had a chance; he really is a loser #ortiz
ortiz celebrated his loss with a party after the fight. he never had any intention of trying to win this fight. and that sucks #mayweather
but even after saying "blame the ref" ortiz says he doesn't blame the ref; he's disingenuous." lost all respect for him. #mayweather
i sincerely believe now after seeing this footage, that ortiz &his camp did this on purpose;  he's all smiles. knew what he was doing
some reporter comes up to ortiz, and is pissed because "you had em," ortiz says,  blame it on the ref, don't blame it on me #mayweather
ortiz is really full of shit... maybe this was preplanned; and mayweather's little girls are adorable #mayweather
keith kizer: don't know how many times Victor wanted to hug mr mayweather, but the feeling of guilt was very high. #mayweather
hbo did do a good job with this extra footage; especially with the Nevada Commissioner's Exec Dir comments, Keith Kizer #mayweather
i wld have "oops" that f*cker too! #mayweather
to which ortiz says "oops" R u effing kidding me? how stupid do they think the fans r? ortiz just effed up his entire career #mayweather
then merchant asked ortiz if that violent obvious headbutt was just a reflex action? WTF? what a biased interview #mayweather
larry merchant really doesn't know anything about boxing; he's such an idiot; he started that BS; #mayweather
watching the larry merchant interview; floyd had his arm around him and ignored the 1st ignore comments by merchant; merchant keeps on
ortiz looked like he was either trying to get himself disqualified or didn't want to fight, he cld have protect himself after the left
doesn't matter if ortiz was texted his girlfriend, he called "let's go," and was looking at the other "ref" the timekeeper. #mayweather
this angle of the camera is much better than the night of the fight you can see the illegal headbutt, the lets go, left right #mayweather
watched it about 20 times to see the flagrant headbutt, hear the ref say "let's go," ortiz could have got up i think #mayweather
let's go at :09; another hug at :07; left at :06 right at :05 canvas at :04 #mayweather
one kiss at :10 secs #mayweather
4th 1:18 headbutt; warned again for headbutting; at :15 flagrant headbutt
combinations come out beginning of fourth round; 4th round 2:20 secs headbutt, warning for headbutting by ref
floyd looked really good in 3rd round #mayweather
round 2 :23 secs headbutt by ortiz #mayweather
watching for the other headbutts they said we're done earlier in the fight. #mayweather

agree with Roland Martin, HBO should've interviewed referee. Joe Cortez has a reputation for being a good referee #starpower
RT @rolandsmartin: Fail by @HBO. They should have interviewed the referee to get his take. You cover the post-fight like other sports do ...
@AverageBro do you know anything about boxing??? Headbutting is illegal thats WHY a point is taken away. But Mayweather didnt lose a point.
don't think you can headbutt me and then apologize? y is mayweather held to a higher standard? ortiz illegal headbutt; mayweather legal shot
what do you mean, Mayweather took advantage? Its an effing fight? you're fighting to win. And its okay to headbutt? #starpower
@AverageBro that's ridiculous. so you head butt me and then apologize; ask for forgiveness later? he had a chance to fight fair.
how can they focus only on the "protect yourself" but not on the illegal head butt? Larry Merchant is obviously slanted. #starpower
are you freaking kidding??????? Larry Merchant is a joke! Ortiz jumped up and hit him with his head #starpower it's an effing fight!
you wish you would 50 yrs younger... that wouldn't help your racist azz #starpower
are you effing kidding me? i agree with mayweather... double standards from the larry merchant #starpower
emmanuel stewart is an azz - what the hell is classy about a head-butt? people don't like mayweather but he knocked that dirty fighter out
what the hell is wrong with these damn HBO comentators? is a head butt classy? hell yeah... mayweather f'ed him up #starpower
thank you ref!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! he intentionally head butted him #starpower   mayweather returned that fucking favor but it was legal
RT @rolandsmartin: Ortiz prefers more of a brawl. Floyd won't fall for it. He's too smart for that #starpower
uncle roger - keep bangin that b#tch up... #starpower   2 rounds for mayweather
south paw or not ortiz can't land on mayweather; uncle roger kills me
if ortiz beats mayweather tonight that makes him the baddest boxer n world becuz he did smthing no other boxer could do in 15 yrs #starpower

RT @WALT_LEON: Ortiz in the locker room looking like the first karate kid tho
ortiz is from kansas! really? the mexican anthem?
gomez still ad the wherewithal to duck that last shot from alvarez; if you can duck a punch you aren't knocked out. underwhelmed by alvarez
spoke too soon; but that was waaaayyyy too early to stop that fight. gomez was stunned but looked like he cld go further
alvarez has the more powerful punch but seems afraid to throw any
alvarez seems like he's trying to keep his face pretty; he's not throwing punches; if this is future of mexican fighters i'm not impressed
still waiting to see if alvarez has star power... not convinced.
bullshit... mayweather does not use his elbows; that is his defensive style.
alvarez is a good fighter, but next star... hmmm... don't think so. victor ortiz even if he loses tonight is really the next star of boxing
you can only judge a fighter by the opponents they've beat. alvarez hasn't fought many tought fighers.
alvarez over gomez by tko
very honorable fight; whooped the kids butt; not bad for a 14 years senior to that 21 y/o; he earned his $350k tonight
experience over youth... good fight. morales did the damn thang
morales for the win
morales is chasing that young boy; look at cano's face
next round alvarez and gomez; i think alvarez
damn morales is going after that eye
8th round was cano's easily; cano is chasing morales; both come out with spunk in 8th
cano is predictable; morales can brace for that right; good combo by 21 y/o
this could go either way... Cano aint no punk; morales aint gonna go out like an old man either
morales needs to keep focusing on those body shots
young cano comes out of corner bouncing... anxious
seems like every time morales gets one good punch cano gets two in; you
21 y/o Cano seems measured and not reckless; morales seems off balance, but smart enought to throw punches at the body to slow this kid down
rother thinks that this youngster, CANO, is about to  KO MORALES. and when you see CANO's record he may be right. CANO is undefeated

Online Townhall Meeting: http://www.whitehouse.gov/OpenForQuestions/
Bill Bennett & CNN spinning Obama's clever respns by saying he was angry. I didn't see that:seemed unflappable; even smiled as he stung back

@DryerBuzz I can't wait to get rid of Perry. He turned down the stimulus for unemployed to position himself 4governor's race. he sucks ass
@coconuts0117 are you aware you just stated the Republican mantra? big business flourishes under a republican administration
Oooh. President Obama smiled as he delivered that fatal blow to Ed Henry's ego. LOVE IT!
President's response: "the alternative...settle on lower growth rates...continue to contract...i don't think is the better option." Agreed.
Twitterers react 2 Ed Henry smack http://tinyurl.com/cs95vy
@shanxiyer couldn't agree with you more.Ed Henry is an amateur. using stunts like this to try and build a reputation. ppl see right thru him
Chris Todd sucks ass. He's pushing that mentality of diversion among the american people rather than against Wall Street for putting us here
wonder if Chris Todd is willing to sacrific some of his salary for some of the people who have been recently laid off.Chris Todd sucks ass.
Good response Mr. President! Americans ARE sacrificing and Obama gave very good examples of that: Parents cutting back for college; workers
Chris Todd "why haven't you asked the public to sacrifice something specific?" WTF??? this is that mentality of "us versus them"
catching CNN's rebroadcast of President Obama's news conference.

Republican Sen. Thune proposes a $936 bill tax rebate; 4 mid class but, Heritage Foundation (conservativethink tank) says they DON'T WORK
John McCain's "plan," mostly consisted of a year-long payroll tax cut, was voted down by Senate. McCain forgets that he lost for a reason
McCain says there hasn't been bipartisanship but he started a lame petition to derail the stimulus. That was real productive. IT LOST

@Jill_HW thanks! for the autism answer... it had me puzzled
@angelaugust me too... but obama stayed presidential.
sarah palin's child has downs  syndrome, i thought? is that the same as autism?
joe schmoe!who gives a fat rats ass whether joe is rich?! it's time to help mid-class & poor get there too! mccain doesnt care about them!
y is every person mccain/palin talks to is named JOE? joe six-pack, joe the plumber, say it isn't so Joe
mccain comes across as a contempuous and jealous old man intimidated by his calm, "eloquent" and very STEADY younger opponent #current
mccain is nasty... that was rather derogatory, the stmt about eloquence
palin will set women back 50 - 60 yrs!!!!!!
schiffer is asking some good questions
did mccain just interrupt obama midstream... okay now I wanna kick his ass
how funny? troopergate turns into another smear campaign against Obama, and i bet he doesnt even kno Palin's bro-in-law. :)  what a tramp!

@DavidStephenson prbly not. let's face it, there are just stupid people in every race and at every level of society
@DavidStephenson i have had to resist calling them stupid to their faces, but they know i think their racists :)
@DavidStephenson i have 2 aunts that live in akron and they both are for mccain cause they insist obama is a muslim & it just boils me over
mccain talked about buying up foreclosed homes to help falling property values, but if the govt goes in and buys low, then values decline
who's steady hand is he talking about? he is the most erratic politician ever
@current #current Senator Obama - clearly. He stayed above the fray and still made major points on healthcare, energy, and foreign affairs
is it me or is tom brokaw is rude when he talks to obama
there would be no need for a surge had we not gone into this unfounded backward azz war

i mean tom brokaw is not UNbiased... sorry 'bout that...
mccain is a blowhard
tom brokaw is not biased
i agree that we should Pakistan accountable
McCain would likely increase military aid to Pakistan (itself an Islamic nuclear power).
all his life he has been a hot head... his answer is to stay in a war with no plan to get out, until we win - what constitutes a win?
is it me, or does everything that McCain starts out with is and attack... a cool hand? McCain can't control his shakey hands
@xenijardin thank you for that twit... i agree... and i'm working on it

@ricksanchezcnn it is the poor judglement of senators like McCain: phil gramm, keating, deregulation, sarah palin
@ricksanchezcnn executives of Freddie? Rick Davis? who will have a lump sum in the coffers of Davis Manafort once the election is over?

@ricksanchezcnn it wasn't the "idea" it was deregulation!!!!
@ricksanchezcnn i thought her job was to go after obama; she repaired her image...but??? is she running for 2012?
@ricksanchezcnn Biden knows what he's talking about & he's sincere. Palin's a soundbite; held her own,but no depthof character, no sincerity
Biden knows what he's talking about & he's sincere. Palin is a sound-bite, she held her own but shows no depth of character, no sincerity.
the resounding message I'm getting from Biden is trust. I feel like I can trust him - he knows what he's talking about and he's sincere.
@ricksanchezcnn Biden feels like "trust". I feel like I can trust him - he knows what he's talking about and he's sincere.
@current she's going to attack Obama... she's a good attack machine. I hope Biden goes after McCain and slaps her when she talks Comm Svc

I ecently had to forego a week's vacation because my work demanded I be on point. I say no one should go on vacation until this is resolved

since pork is a filthy swine(to him) and lipstick won't strike a chord,i hope she doesn‚Äôt make a folksy joke about moose & camels.
What will Sarah Palin and Hamid Karzai talk about?
Also, you should change your name to: Rick "A.C." Sanchez. Or should we call you Mr. Anti-Christ? :) I didn't know you were part of the govt
Rick! Really good interview with Tony Alamo! I can't believe he alluded that God might ordain the marriage of a 10-12 yr old girl!
