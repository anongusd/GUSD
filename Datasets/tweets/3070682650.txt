August 13th NATIONAL DEFENSE CONTRACTOR APPRECIATION DAY!
Defense Fellow in Washington D.C. THIS IS A VITAL STEP IN THE PROCESS! Any help would be greatly appreciated. If you have points of contact that I could send inquiry letters to that would be amazing as well! Thank you all so much for your support in making
vested interest. In order to do this, we need the help of professional organizations or groups that would be will to submit a letter to me in regards to support and what this bill would mean to their organization. The letter will then be collected and mailed to Kelly McManus,
As many of you know, my family and I have made HUGE progress in accomplishing our goal of making August 13th, National Defense Contractor Appreciation Day. It is customary, with any legislation, that support from stakeholders is needed. This lets Congress know that there is a

@gifhawk @timdoty1 Carlton Bragg... Just leaving that here
Tell me... Why would KU sit their own player AND turn it in to the NCAA if they had ANYTHING to hide? Ridiculous. KU tattled on themselves because it was the right thing to do not because they were hiding anything... Wish common sense would prevail...
So they will more than likely slap KU on the wrist with scholarship loss or probation... De Sousa wont be cleared and he will likely declare eliminating that problem... The only other play questionable was Preston... He never played a game because KU did their own investogation..
This means that the NCAA doeant have control over their own establishment but want to hold schools accountable for control... NCAA knows they cleared De Sousa and that they cant punish a school for their short comings...
Sooo... NCAA realizes it messed up. They know the verdicts say that the schools had no participation but want to wait for the rest of the trials. Then they want to establish a board of non NCAA people to word as a sanctions board going forward... https://t.co/nEFzi2qjY3

@B_of_H @RockChalkPhog25 They absolutely did and acted with assumption. There should have been at least one text specifically mentioning money just one. There wasnt. They were reaching and pointing the finger elsewhere. All speculation and zero proof.
Lastly, the NCAA cleared De Sousa. In fact it took them longer than it should have to clear him. So if Self had De Sousa paid to finish his high school classes why oh why wouldnt the NCAA know about it? His clearing is on them not KU as KU withheld him until they had word.
Let that sink in... He apologized to Self for not getting Ayton to KU after he paid him to go to Arizona... Thats a fact. So Gassnola is telling KU they will get him and is going behind KUs back and sending him to Arizona... This alone speaks volumes and says Self didnt know...
Like Mason and Graham? Makes no sense. People are taking the word of a lawyer over facts? The text messages are no explicit enough to definitively say they knew. Thirdly, Gassnola sent a text apologizing to Self for not getting Ayton a player he PAID to get to Arizona...
Investigation and hold Billy Preston out voluntarily? Secondly, if Kansas or Bill Self were willingly and knowingly paying players and were "cheating" why are they not pumping out higher draft picks regularly? Why have their best players traditionally been 4 yr kids...
Thought: So people are saying KU is cheating and paying their player based on vague text messages and the word of a lawyer PAID to get his client off charges... So if Kansas knew their players were being paid and in fact had a hand in it why would they hold their own...

All for @NCAA paying kids to play ball... On the flipside it wont solve the current corruption being alleged... Put a cap on what schools can offer? Someone will go backdoor and sweeten the deal... They created this monster and set up an unrealistic business model.
@TalkinHawks Villanova was not a less talented team....
@millisgreg @Kansashoopschat @AdamZagoria @jessenewell He is contradicting what his client said. His client denied the coaches knowing anything so does that mean he perjured himself? Makes no sense

@jaketoobies @jakepete20 @MahatmaJahdney @DanWetzel Keeping it neutral but teams like ISU arent on the radars of these reps. Why? Well look at national championships, notoriety, etc. If ISU was an upper echelon basketball school it would happen. I doubt Monte Morris was paid anything it was a good opportunity.
@KU_Owns_You Trying to remain subjective but if this Gassnola guy went out of his way to hide these transactions how again is that KUs fault? If the NCAA cleared to DeSousa again how is KU responsible?

@SouthwestAir Yes i did. My family boarded in theor a positions as my son has autism and is prone to meltdowns with sudden change
@SouthwestAir then when i was finally able to board i had my ticket snatched out of my hand.Questioning ever flying southwest again.
@SouthwestAir then when i allowed my husband &amp; child to board i was told i couldn't be seated in family boarding since i had no child w/ me
@SouthwestAir you might train your boarding reps about customer service. Separated from my family because our boarding #s were a59 a60 &amp; b1
