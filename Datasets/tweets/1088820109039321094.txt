@JoshGellers @benshapiro I have a lot of ideas in common with Shapiro, so my reaction to hearing Shapiro called alt-right is about the same as what you said, ‚ÄúThey are nationalist [and socialist] white supremacists. We have NOTHING in common.‚Äù
@JoshGellers @benshapiro This may not have been Ben‚Äôs greatest tweet. 		I‚Äôm not a huge fan of Candice Owns though. 		On race issues, i think John McWhorter has some interesting ideas. Also there‚Äôs the venerable Thomas Sowell
@JoshGellers @benshapiro Regarding the images above, I‚Äôm currently reading Mein Kampf and I have sometimes browsed Alt-right dot com because, like you, I despise their ideology. But I think you would be surprised at how different they are from mainstream GOP with their social and economic views.
@JoshGellers @benshapiro That‚Äôs a great question. There used to be some ambiguity about who was alt-right. Many used it to mean ‚Äúyoung cons on new media.‚Äù But after Charlottesville all (that I know of) mainstream GOP rejected the term. Only people like R. Spencer still use the term for themselves. https://t.co/gKsTDxB6lx
@JoshGellers @benshapiro All that being said, I agree with you that What happens in the case with one celebrity has no indication of whether racism is dead or not.
@JoshGellers @benshapiro Interestingly Democrats and alt-right both hate Ben Schapiro for the same reason. They hate him for his opposition to identity politics.
@JoshGellers @benshapiro Honestly dude, you probably have a lot more in common with the altright than Ben Shapiro does. I‚Äôm guessing you and altright both believe in generous government social programs, universal healthcare, state education, identity politics.

@edgyaphrodite @LostEcho7 @sarahwoodwriter @TomiLahren When I read Frederick Douglass, I see economic and racial philosophy that is about identical to the the one held by myself and many of my fellow GOP. There are crazy ppl in both parties. But it‚Äôs false to say they switched sides.

@collin_doucet That‚Äôs correct. As Mussolini said in th quote I shared, commies were based on class,fascists on nation, but both were for state control and provision. Th philosophy is basically of the same pedigree. 		It‚Äôs very different from the free market and limited gov‚Äôt of mainstream cons. https://t.co/smwMZNnVuG
@collin_doucet (I don‚Äôt know if it makes a difference to you, but I consider myself to be a Frederick Douglass Republican. I think D.Trump is not a good person, but he has done some good things so far. Declaring an emergency was definitely a BAD thing.)
@collin_doucet None of these things strike me as conservative. 		Even today‚Äôs ‚Äúalt-right‚Äù has more similarity to the Left than to mainstream cons.		R. Spencer supports abortion, single payer healthcare, basic income, identity politics. 		Cons oppose all of those things
@collin_doucet Left strongly supports Planned Parenthood and legacy of Margaret Sanger, a passionate supporter of eugenics, just like Hitler. Minimum wage started for the explicit reason to force out ‚Äúunfit‚Äù races out of the job market. Unions were major force of racism.
@collin_doucet I‚Äôd have to disagree here. Today‚Äôs Left still respects leaders like Wilson and FDR who had fascist inspired policies or spoke highly of fascists. Kennedy spoke approvingly of Hitler even after the war. Gobbels (or Himmler?) wanted to collab w/ communists saying they had samegoals

@collin_doucet 5 Socialism=the friend of big business. What did Amazon do after they raised their min wage? Lobby gvt to raise min wage. Highly automated Amzn knows that small competitors rely more on human labor. A raised wage law eliminates their competition.
@collin_doucet 4 As I understand there was strong government control of private industry,which socialists are so fond of. This is the specter of the Green New Deal. Incidentally in this way large industry can have outsized influence because they can shape rules to force out small business.
@collin_doucet 3  If antifa can‚Äôt even distinguish btwn fash and socialism, how dissimilar can they be?		I‚Äôd be interested in reading some documentation on what you claim, namely that Hitler privatized things. Did he give them freedom to operate independently of the government control?

@michaleen @JonahNRO That‚Äôs true. Could be a bit of a hyperbole to say it‚Äôs outrage.
@Litcoin2462 @SenSanders All I‚Äôm saying is that Fascism is a left-wing phenomenon. Out of the Nazi (National Socialist) 25 point platform, Bernie basically agrees with 17 of them. Mainstream GOP agrees with only 2. 		Read Mussolini; you will find a dedicated Leftist.

@sandyw_artist @SenSanders It‚Äôs our Hispanic-American brothers and sisters who are most at risk because of an insecure border.
@sandyw_artist @SenSanders But the troubling factor is that usually American Hispanics are the ones victimized by Hispanic illegal immigrant crime. Upper class white Senators are almost guaranteed not to be victimized by an illegal immigrant from southern border.
@sandyw_artist @SenSanders If I remember right, illegal immigrant crime is much lower than general population, but Latin American illegal immigrant crime is almost the same as that of American Hispanics.
