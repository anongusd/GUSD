@RepJayapal @realDonaldTrump What world do you live?La la land?	You got your ass handed to you in 2016 because of immigration, SO bad they tried it again.

@SenatorDurbin @Morning_Joe OK EVERYBODY, Call Mcconnells office tell him to pass the justice bill. Politely.
@SenGillibrand NOT GOOD ENOUGH. UHC, instead of spending 18% of are GDP on health-care with only a portion of people covered with junk insurance,(PLUS private funds)	We want to spend 2-3% of are GDP and everybody's covered,and no one is going Bankrupt. Like all developed Countries have.
@RashidaTlaib Good for you.	NOW, get busy on a Healthcare bill,	That's what you ran on,and stop prancing around gloating.

@SenSchumer I am not a fan of the wall,but, all you have to do is look on Social Media,and the border is a major concern(to put it lightly).	I suggest you go thousands of miles past the border and write an aid Package with ropes attached to the failed states. Stopping Corruption etc.
@georget2002273 @VoteOjeda2020 $15 minimum, it is directed at big Corporations that have they're labor subsidized by tax payer's,with healthcare, food stamps, etc.	That many of them do.	There's clause for small business etc.

@FAIRImmigration @NBCNews @JuliaEAinsley @Abs_NBC They're sending up another Division!
@SenSchumer His Pastor is going to Hell.

@lisa4congress @cathymcmorris I told everybody, "she lies" Beautiful but lies.
@danielfeehan Were going for UHC Dan.
@BernieSanders I Thought They Were "PRO-LIFE"
@FAIRImmigration @BreitbartNews @JxhnBinder If you put out totally bullshit headlines like this your going to lose credibility.she doesn't have plans for"open border", she doesn't want the wall,and she won't bargain shit with Trump,and he won't with her.Broken,So you want things worse or better?get our guns civil war?ok?
@Education4Libs Dude you care so much, get your gun go south and help stop the invasion.
Our country is a mess,because cutting the Education dollar produces idiots like this watching 	FOX news and believing it.	Boycott this book.	Angel's Educate him. https://t.co/xTbijXr7Bu
@BernieSanders Righteous on Bernie!
@HouseDemocrats I don't think he knows about 	Socialist Media?
@FAIRImmigration @BreitbartNews @JxhnBinder GUY'S, I heard and seen her say, "she wants a closed border" she's willing to compromise.	State your stance, will pick the candidates.
@SenSchumer Hear that? He speaks in 1960's political lies, 	 You know like McConnell,and Grassley. Somebody needs to tell them about Socialist Media!
@PhilBredesen Listen to Taylor everybody, Vote! Bredesen!
@AltonNorr @ColinAllredTX What's this we shit alone ranger?
@SenSchumer Is that called "Robbing the hood"?
@senatemajldr Mitch,	 Aprx. 80% of the American people want the border closed.	 Aprx. 80% of the American people want UHC.	 When are we doing what the American people want?	 Is this a Democracy?	 When do we do what the Majority want?	Or do the American people get it in one end or the other?
@PhilBredesen Let's get this Guy Elected! Vote!
@ColinAllredTX I do not agree with family separation. How do you suggest we respect American's, 	Who's life's and job's are directly affected by illegal immigration?	 Immigration is what cost the D's	The last election, now we suffer with Trump. Screwed from both ends by both parties. AMClass.
@BillGates @EU_Commission Righteous on Bill!
@HarleyRouda @NowThisPolitics I Know!
@TinaSmithMN Heresy Tina.

@lisa4congress Careful.... use your own merit,please.
@DrKimSchrier @realDonaldTrump I know there's many illegal's coming through your state as well I've seen it with my own eyes,	I've work construction jobs in Issaquah, that were full of illegal's, And the pay was $#%&amp;.	Do you want to debate this Now?
@RealDonad_Trump Stop aid to Mexico if they let them through as well.
@lisa4congress Are we supposed to like this tweet?
@lisa4congress How about up to internet neutral?
@lisa4congress Go get Michael Moors movie  " where to invade next" it's nothing like the title. See how the rest of the world lives.  Were way behind, it's  Sobering. I love America, but were being scammed.
@DrKimSchrier I worked in Issaquah 2yrs. Ago Beautiful area.	I loved it.
@DrKimSchrier That's what Reagan said in"86"said 1.1 mil.Were here, gave Amnesty to 3.3 mil.Never closed the border. Ruined most my friends (and their children's lifes).	Now, we stop the R's, Bernie Debates R's on UHC.Then I will personally debate the entire Dem.P. on Amnesty and Immigration
@JoshuaWelle Use your faith,(luke)(just kidding)(not really just kidding).	  Study,Study,Study, concentrate on your faith,	Then have it,and Go. Trust in the lord.

@IT_Disciple @ChuckGrassley We need Universal health-care. Go back and read my tweets, weeks gone by. 	Do you know who I am? Do you know  what the powers that be have done to my life?	The Lord guides me.
@IT_Disciple @ChuckGrassley More than you know.
@RealDonad_Trump Have you seen they have another Division headed are way? Didn't stop.
@FAIRImmigration Here comes another Division!
@KatieHill4CA @Alyssa_Milano Tell Alyssa I Love her in, SO MANY WAYS!
@GinaOrtizJones @HurdOnTheHill I want to see Bernie Debate 10 Republican's at the same time on health-care, Because I know 1  person telling the truth will beat 10-liars lieing.
@IT_Disciple @ChuckGrassley And how can you be Jesus when I am?
@IT_Disciple @ChuckGrassley I got more but I dont want you to cry.
@IT_Disciple @ChuckGrassley Because he's a Senator opposing ACA,	Cherrying picking it until it's destroyed,	Installed Kavanaugh to help destroy it.	Then talks about his corn, well I'm literally lying in bed right now in pain,my son just got home from school. Now I have  to take a opioid to cook. LITERALLY.
@CBSThisMorning @JoeBiden @NorahODonnell They suppressed my vote!
@IT_Disciple @ChuckGrassley Just surgery through my junk insurance would be good.
@ChuckGrassley Yeah, I'm wondering how I'm going to pay next months rent. Because I'm down to 10-15 hours a week from my bad hip I cant get surgery on.	And I'm a single parent. How the other half (98%)lives.
@LegalAidNYC Is that the little Napoleon that wouldn't comply?	Did you see the tape?
@AmyMcGrathKY @barrforcongress I'm pretty sure the Democrats are calling to close the borders, there's a little work to do on them (D's), but manageable. 	The Republican's are lost to their Corporate Masters! Junk!
@FAIRImmigration @GovExec Good time to find out who's here!
@joekennedy Why didn't go see Kristen Sinema?
@BenJealous He should be, but we cant waste the time effortetc.,won't be good for country, let him sit there do nothing and sulk.
@SenatorDurbin Ask McConnell if he would be so kind to Debate UHC.? With Senator Sanders. On the floor of the Senate.
@IronStache @SpeakerRyan I know I'm deadbeat after fighting 20+ years of their lieing and TORTURE! Not to mention their wag the dog entrapment.
@Ojeda4congress McConnells pastor is going to hell, he hasn't taught him Good!
@SenSchumer I dont know am I suppose to press the like button on this?
@HouseGOP @FoxBusiness Remember when Bush wanted to privatize S.S.,	Then the market crashed,(thanks to tax cuts),	What do you think it would have been like if all the S.S. money would have been gone?	Into the R's and their wealthy friends pockets.
@HouseGOP @FoxBusiness How long till the bubble burst ?
@HouseGOP @WSJ If you go work for McDonald's, you'll have to do it without health care. Because the Republican's are cutting Medicare/Medicaid.
@FAIRImmigration No,but you do not let people go hungry.
@Scholten4Iowa @SteveKingIA @bpolitics How much is that rich man worth?
@senatemajldr Still patting yourself on the back for that.	Now your getting ready to rob the old,the poor,the injured,etc.	You know who I am Mitch?	You're not that far away from meeting your maker,that's not a threat,that's reality. 	If you're so Righteous go debate Bernie on HC.,No you won't.
@HillaryClinton Can you get here and help Kristen Sinema,	Az. ?
@FAIRImmigration @Reuters @DoinaChiacu Good
@FAIRImmigration @BreitbartNews @JxhnBinder All they have to do is say Amnesty and they'll lose. If they haven't figured that out they shouldn't be running!
@gretchenwhitmer They're changing their tune now.
RT @HillaryClinton: Whatever you do, do something. These midterm elections are our last chance to defend our democracy. Let's win.
@MaryGeren I Care about American workers too,and. That's why I support work permits for immigrants and not Amnesty. Unless you want to Bankrupt Social Security instead of just cut it like the R's. I Suggest we wait for this debate for after the Election's.Trying for UHC for America now.
@FAIRImmigration @dcexaminer @Anna_Giaritelli I Hope So!
Rock On! https://t.co/J9RbOsbleN
@FAIRImmigration @LifeZette @BrendanKKirby There's no if,it was probably planned by their Government.
@BernieSanders Bernie your going to have to call out one of those people (R) and debate them on 	Universal health-care!
@FAIRImmigration No,But you dont let anyone go hungry.
@Abby4Iowa No to pathway to Amnesty,	Do you want to Represent American citizens 	Or the citizens of other countries?
@JennyWilsonUT @KUER_FM No pathway to Amnesty.
@erfleuncuffed @RealSheriffJoe @realDonaldTrump And what's that?
@Abby4Iowa @RepRodBlum That's how arrogant they are.
@ChuckGrassley Then this,then that,then this,then if that happens we do this ,unless that happens,than do this,then those that then.....	How About Universal health-care Like every other Country....Or are they all stupid,or are,are wealthy greedy?
@JohnKasich Country over Party!
@FAIRImmigration @FoxNews @PaulinaDedaj They're Sending in another Division!	Stop the invasion!
@Scholten4Iowa @SteveKingIA I hope you have paper trail ballots.
@FAIRImmigration The issueing  of cards is an act of defiance.But when they attack American citizens that speak out against illegal immigration by hacking and releasing online information,and organizing efforts to damage said person's in a number of ways. It is the opposite of assimilation.
@SenSanders They're still falsifying records and denying me surgery.
@FAIRImmigration @IRLILaw Catch and deport!
@FAIRImmigration Bullshit, why didn't they fund it last Dec.	What the hell they going to cut to fund it now?
@SenatorCollins This behavior has no place in our country. 	 I truly hope you and your's are safe, and they are apprehended.

@vicedeb @FAIRImmigration @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @thehill Eisenhower got the idea for the interstate from seeing the autobonn Hitler built. And how it was used efficiently to mobilize is armies.	 Are fore-father's new immigration was important on a daily basis. Native Americans know what happens when it's unregulated.	Now were here.
@vicedeb @FAIRImmigration @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @thehill The border must be closed, and a census done.	No bigotry intended, Were talking the intelligent  thing to do, for America and American's. 	I'll wager there is 30-40 million. 	1-dollar.
@amyklobuchar WHERE did you meet your husband?
@hiral4congress @DebbieLesko @azcentral Back to the issues.
@vicedeb @FAIRImmigration @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson With the new facial recognition, they're finding many unscreened are using forged documents. 	And many were coming through unguarded shorelines in Washington,from all over. They are Educated but still illegal. It's an organized effort to skirt are laws.
@vicedeb @FAIRImmigration @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson The Rhetoric needs to stop.
@vicedeb @FAIRImmigration @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson The misconception that the only illegal problem  we have comes from the south is misleading. They may be the closest,the threat is coming from all over the world.They are organized and well funded many times from the Gov. They claim is the reason they're leaving.
@FAIRImmigration @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson You show ignorant shit like this you appeal to the bigots, keep your argument on  the high road. You'll get better listeners.
@ElCapitanMicahP @BetoORourke @joekennedy Thanks Obama! Remember Clinton handing your Bush a balanced budget and he drove the Economy over the cliff, Trump's doing the same.
@HouseGOP @CNBC Thanks Obama!
This is not the common denominator of all immigrants,	But a perfect example to justify are frustration and anger.	 Another one that "fell through the cracks"...B.S. https://t.co/acrI3H3hgN
@BetoORourke I hope your state has "paper trail ballots"
@joeradinovich Everybody these are the seats we need to flip the House! Get busy!

@SenSanders I Love you Bernie,and your right.	But Eisenhower was a 5-star General, that's O.K., I got that part covered.	He also advocated for Universal health-care,and offered the insurance industry a"No loss clause" 	Right before he left office,that was his last big issue. Vote Dem.
@BetoORourke I hope you win,but, No to Amnesty,this is a country of Laws,and blanket Amnesty is your way not my way ,and you can't have it all your way. That way totally tells me and my friends F'you,and what we want, your move.
