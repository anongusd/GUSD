@RachelNotley $5,147 vs human extinction. Sounds like a fair trade, at least to and oil executive or an Alberta Premier.
@RachelNotley Not all Alberta crude is sold at a discount.  Only those volumes that exceed the capacities of existing pipelines.  But current crude prices are not important when compared to the prospect of human extinction.  Human extinction will do immeasurable damage to the price of crude!
@RachelNotley Failure to act to reduce the global use of fossil fuels will result in the extinction of the human race. In the interim, Canada must plan for an influx of millions of climate refugees from central America and the USA as crop yields drop due to higher temperatures and drought.
@RachelNotley It is time to put a stop to the growth of the our fossil fuel industry. Investors should be looking at ways to leverage profits from existing production to transition to new energy sources like solar, wind, geothermal and improved efficiencies.  We must also look at our cities.

@theCP24 @Coach3House @mikepolkjr @realDonaldTrump I think that is what the idea of democracy requires. In every other election, the person with the most votes wins. We should vote directly for the president and if nobody gets a majority, there should be a run-off election. The problem with the popular vote is that Democrats win.
@realDonaldTrump Does that include government officials who prevent citizens of our county from voting?
@TechHelp @TheRicolaJingle @realDonaldTrump @RepMcSally I have never heard of the Legion.  Do you have a reference?
@TechHelp @TheRicolaJingle @realDonaldTrump @RepMcSally It was a total loss.
@TechHelp @TheRicolaJingle @realDonaldTrump @RepMcSally The US constitution did not create the United States. The United States created the Constitution.  The United States was created by the Declaration of Independence in 1776. https://t.co/CuDjdx5w3Y
@TheRicolaJingle @TechHelp @realDonaldTrump @RepMcSally Okay.  But when the Spanish American War broke out, it was fought by state militias, not a huge American regular army.  The USA depended on state organized militias for the defense of the nation until it entered WWI in 1917.
@TheRicolaJingle @realDonaldTrump @RepMcSally The militias defending Maryland from the British went into battle at Bladensburg, and were routed by a small force of well trained British Regular Army and some natives. The left of their own accord because they had no supply lines and were outnumbered. They were not even pursued
@TheRicolaJingle @realDonaldTrump @RepMcSally Don't think so.  He commanded a small group of "regulars"only because he couldn't get the states to send militiamen.  He was involved in attacking what is now Toronto with some success but his attack on Montreal was completely stopped. He never defended Washington or Maryland.
@TheRicolaJingle @realDonaldTrump @RepMcSally But it doesn't say that the arms are for personal protection and should be carried openly in public on a daily basis.  And what is the definition of "Arms"? In 1775, it was a muzzle loading smooth bore single shot. Isn't an Abrams Tank an arm? How about an F18 or ...
@TheRicolaJingle @realDonaldTrump @RepMcSally But not by opposing them. The design was to make the militias so weak that they could never pose such a threat.  The founders where quite confident that they would never become a totalitarian government on their own, only through the action of a strong federal army.
@TechHelp @TheRicolaJingle @realDonaldTrump @RepMcSally I am sure they took your argument into consideration.  But the Congress didn't want a strong army for fear of the army taking over and installing a dictator as had happened many times in Europe and in other countries.
@TechHelp @TheRicolaJingle @realDonaldTrump @RepMcSally That was the Continental army. It was disbanded after the British were defeated. Yes it comes form Wikipedia.  It is the first thing that shows up when you do a search for this aspect of our history.
@TheRicolaJingle @realDonaldTrump @RepMcSally Really? Who lead the US Army that allowed the British to get so far into the heartland?
@TheRicolaJingle @realDonaldTrump @RepMcSally No I have argued 180 degrees from your point.  The second amendment exists to provide men to defend the nation and to put down insurrections at the state level.  Any action outside of the state is at the command of the President only.  Read the constitution. Its not that long.
@TheRicolaJingle @realDonaldTrump @RepMcSally https://t.co/iqDJN9rBXe
@TheRicolaJingle @realDonaldTrump @RepMcSally The US relied on militias because they were distributed and controlled by the states and thus were unlikely to pose a threat to the central government.
@TheRicolaJingle @realDonaldTrump @RepMcSally Everyone has the right to their own opinions no matter how divergent they are from the facts.  The USA initially relied on militias, up until 1917, because there was a fear that a powerful central army might take over the government and install a dictator.  You have it backwards.
@TheRicolaJingle @realDonaldTrump @RepMcSally Yes thats right. It was created in 1775 disbanded right after the British were defeated. This is the result. https://t.co/vLJrvvOk9o Bladensburg is outside of Washington DC and militias were so ineffective that a small British force burned the capital including the White House.
@TheRicolaJingle @realDonaldTrump @RepMcSally The army was used mainly to kill natives who were somewhat pissed at having their homeland stolen.  The defense of the nation was left to state irregular militias that usually met once a week to drill and do target practice.  https://t.co/vLJrvvOk9o
@TheRicolaJingle @realDonaldTrump @RepMcSally After the war, the Continental Army was quickly disbanded because of the  American distrust of standing armies, and irregular state militias  became the new nation's sole ground army, with the exception of a regiment to guard the Western Frontier and one battery of artillery ....
@TheRicolaJingle I know but for a fallacy to be anecdotal it has to be based on an anecdote. What is the anecdote that my argument is based on. I used the information you provided to merely examined it for internal consistency and it appears on the surface to be beyond the realm of believably.
@TheRicolaJingle Yes but that is not all it said.
@TheRicolaJingle @realDonaldTrump @RepMcSally Ad hominem attack is a false argument. https://t.co/HB3qqm00OJ After the revolution, the US disbanded its army and relied on state militias for defense. https://t.co/fjv0568dxC The war of 1812 was largely fought by militia. A real standing army wasn't formed until WW 1 in 1917.
@TheRicolaJingle So what is my personal experience that serves as the anecdote?
@TheRicolaJingle https://t.co/J6RV13JaTa	https://t.co/jYOL82uWQh	"anecdotal logical fallacy" is still gibberish.
@TheRicolaJingle Meaningless words.
@TheRicolaJingle @realDonaldTrump @RepMcSally Yea.  Well stand nice and close.  The explosions are directional.
@TheRicolaJingle @realDonaldTrump @RepMcSally But if anyone suggests laws that might prevent criminals from buying guns such as universal background checks or controls on the sale and use of ammunition, the 2nd Amendment people cry that the government is taking their guns.  It is insanity.
@TheRicolaJingle @realDonaldTrump @RepMcSally Well that is a good reason to make them easily available to fugitive felons and mental patients. Without the criminals with guns, how would you justify gun ownership. Oh! I am sooo scared of all the gun toting criminals.  https://t.co/FUTlr0fn0h
@TheRicolaJingle @realDonaldTrump @RepMcSally No. Actually it was to protect against foreign invasion and to put down slave revolts.  When the US was formed, Britain was still in control of Canada which included Vermont, upstate NY, Northern Michigan and Wisconsin. What you suggest is called treason. But I sympathize.
@TheRicolaJingle The CDC has been forbidden to research gun violence.  The study that Obama ordered was short and sweet and that is why the range of the number of people saved by guns is so large.  How many people do you know who's life was saved by someone having a gun? How many victims of guns?
@TheRicolaJingle 500,000 to 3,000,000 is a 1 to 6 range and betrays a lack of knowledge of the subject.  They may as well say somewhere between 50 and 3 billion.  It is also hard to believe that 3million lives were saved during 300,000 crimes.  That means the average crime threatens 10 people.
@TheRicolaJingle @realDonaldTrump @RepMcSally Next time you are out shooting. put a box of shells into a fire.
@Diane_Reid @RepMcSally @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse There has been a revision.  The policy now is, "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore and we will put them in cages until we can deport their asses." https://t.co/8a7ZTnhSQF
@RepMcSally @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse https://t.co/G1iF40154b
@RepMcSally @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse But you will play politics with the futures of the DACA folks. You will never seal the border.  You may have noticed that the USA borders on the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic Ocean and another body of water to the west.  The DEMs cannot hold anyone hostage. That's a Repubican gig.
@TheRicolaJingle @realDonaldTrump @RepMcSally When did you last attend a militia muster? We have a professional army.  Arms are not being used to keep our country free but to kill each other.
@TheRicolaJingle @realDonaldTrump @RepMcSally Really? Ammunition is classed as explosives.  If you have ammunition in your home, you better check with both your insurance company and the local fire department.  Your insurance may not be valid and the fire department may not fight a fire that involves exploding ammunition.

@realDonaldTrump @RepMcSally No stable genius would help to make it easier for a felon or a mental patient to buy both a gun and ammunition.  A genius would find a way to stop the sale of at least one of these things to felons and mental patients.

@Classical_Lib2u @maplemouth @krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump It tried to out compete the US and as Reagan said, all we had to do was outspend them. Until our government started tearing down public education, there was only a tiny market for education. Public education works well if it is funded properly. It is cheaper than private schools.
@Classical_Lib2u @maplemouth @krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump There is no marketplace for heath care.  We are not talking about a planned economy or a tiny poor country trying to compete with a large rich country and going broke as was the case with the USSR.  The USSR had an economy the size of California's and a similar population.
@Classical_Lib2u @maplemouth @krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump There doesn't have to be equality of outcome, but there should be fairness. There are good aspects to socialism. The choice is not all or nothing. We have adopted some aspects already. Public education for one.  Single payer health care is one that all developed nations have too.

@realDonaldTrump Some people with VERY LOW I.Q. have obsessed over the idea the Elizabeth Warren has any native blood in her veins.  Over and over and over for years.  One even offered to give a $million to a charity if it was true.  But he was a welcher. Donald the welcher.
@Len21878832 @WeSupport45 But you have no evidence of that. You can't say one one hand that the FBI didn't find out that Dr. Ford wasn't who she said she was and then claim that they are infallible doing background checks of Judges. You are just a miserable person who wants to believe bad things about her
@Len21878832 @WeSupport45 I guess the FBI screwed up.  Or maybe they didn't. You can't believe everything you see on facebook.  Who is Bill Rutherford.  Why hasn't someone looked at her husband's facebook page before now.  Something smells bad in Denmark if you ask me.
@realDonaldTrump Anyone you can catch.
@realDonaldTrump Managed to insult more than half of the population with a single tweet.  Her claim is not false and you are a welcher.  Totally dishonest.  What a fucking moron.
@realDonaldTrump It was that wacky Fed Chairman who did that.
@Len21878832 @realDonaldTrump Interesting.  Does she get the money or are the funds for some action groups?  It is hard to scream with an hand over your mouth.  You can say what you want but you will never know how you will react until it happens.
@realDonaldTrump Ah! Blackmail. The foundation of international diplomacy.  How about trying to find out why these people are coming to the USA in the first place and fix it.  A lot of people come here hoping to legally request asylum and are never permitted to apply. How do you determine intent?
@Angel1000prcenr @zany_one_pip @JasperTheWolf1 @johnhawkinsrwn @RightWingNews Item 1 is not true.  We can change things.  We just have to try. I agree with 4 but I include us in the endangered species.

@Classical_Lib2u @maplemouth @krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Of course you might be referring to Ludwig Heinrich Edler von Mises, the 20th century economist.  Not everyone agrees with his ideas.
@Classical_Lib2u @maplemouth @krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump I'm aware of the Pareto principle. It says 20% of the items take 80% of the resources more or less. It was important in my work. Von Mises yield criterion states that yielding of a ductile material  begins when the second deviatoric stress invariant reaches the critical value.
@AlecA82475839 @MaryBro77801894 @denny63177874 @davidhogg111 Control of the sale and use of ammunition works without restricting gun ownership. Just look at Great Britain.  Nobody there owns a gun for self protection because it isn't necessary. But the people there are the same as people here.  So it cannot be a people problem.
@AlecA82475839 @MaryBro77801894 @denny63177874 @davidhogg111 Then why are they not marching with us?  What are your solutions.  NRA says no research into gun safety, no prohibiting bump stocks or trigger cranks. No background checks at gun shows or for private sales. No electronic records of gun sales.  What are your solutions?
@MaryBro77801894 @denny63177874 @AlecA82475839 @davidhogg111 What lies have I told?  As a target shooter myself, I do not consider shooting to be a sport.  A 300 pound guy (or gal) in a wheelchair with a gun is not a sportsman.  It is a skill like woodworking or playing the piano.  Calling me names does not make you right.
@AlecA82475839 @denny63177874 @MaryBro77801894 @davidhogg111 I am over 70 and my experience is that there is a reason why someone has a lot of guns. Some are good reasons but generally they are not.  Preserving history is good.  Substitute for a personality is not.  Lack of self worth is not.  Fear of others is not.
@MaryBro77801894 @denny63177874 @AlecA82475839 @davidhogg111 Millions? My experience is that the women shooters at the competitions have husbands or boyfriends that shoot.

@MaryBro77801894 @AlecA82475839 @denny63177874 @davidhogg111 Hand guns were not designed for hunting. You can use a sharp stick or a rock for hinting too but a handgun is still designed to kill people.
@denny63177874 @MaryBro77801894 @AlecA82475839 @davidhogg111 I know a man confined to a wheelchair who owns over 80 guns.  Many are semi automatic. He has a stockpile of ammunition for each one.  I have a friend with one gun, a single shot 303 used for competition. He reloads spent shells. Who would you rather have as a neighbor?
@denny63177874 @MaryBro77801894 @AlecA82475839 @davidhogg111 Why am I not interested in a legitimate discussion? Is it because I am trying to find a way to save lives while allowing men with tiny dicks to keep their guns? Guns are used as tools for many purposes, but most guns are owned by people with many guns for no particular purpose.

@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Medicare is a model for healthcare for all and it is less expensive than any comparable health insurance plan.  You are lying. The cost will not double or triple what we currently pay for taxes plus health insurance and everyone will be covered.
@denny63177874 @AlecA82475839 @davidhogg111 This is from 27 years ago.  Got anything more recent?
@denny63177874 @AlecA82475839 @davidhogg111 Yes. A people problem. We should outlaw people.  It would make things so much simpler.  Of course, if the Republicans has their way, all of this is moot as in the lifetime of people alive today, we are going to see the continued existence of humanity challenged by climate change.
@denny63177874 @AlecA82475839 @davidhogg111 How many people own a gun for self defense? What are they planning to do, throw the gun at the other person or shoot him/her?  The intended purpose of the gun is to kill others.  They are designed for that purpose and purchased for that purpose.
@MaryBro77801894 @AlecA82475839 @denny63177874 @davidhogg111 Many of the paper killers were designed to kill people. The AR-15 is a semi-auto version of the US armies full auto rifle. Handguns are not designed to put food on the table. They are designed to kill people. More Americans have died domestically than have died in war since 1935.
Do you know anyone, including yourself, who's life was saved by someone present being armed?  Retweet if you wish to tell the story.
@AlecA82475839 @denny63177874 @davidhogg111 Since the CDC is forbidden to do research on firearms safety, the numbers they gave are wags (wild ass guesses).  I am suspicious of the numbers but you can do a survey of your followers.
@AlecA82475839 @denny63177874 @davidhogg111 I am in favor of public transportation.  But the sad fact is that it isn't available in the quantity necessary to serve everyone.
@AlecA82475839 @denny63177874 @davidhogg111 There is no constitutional protection for keeping or owning ammunition.  Arms yes.  Bullets no. I think bullets are more likely to fit into the category of explosives.
@denny63177874 @AlecA82475839 @davidhogg111 Yes.  But how many people kill their neighbors with a truck loaded with fertilizer or a pressure cooker.  Lots of things CAN be used to kill. But only guns are designed to kill people.  Your argument is false and a cop out.
@denny63177874 @davidhogg111 And you realize that the authorities can see your tweets too? Right?
@denny63177874 @davidhogg111 Hope you don't have a house fire. Your insurance would not be much good if the insurance company finds out about this cache of explosives.
@AlecA82475839 @denny63177874 @davidhogg111 If this is true, them my argument is even more important.  But I have a real hard time believing the CDC Report. At 3 million that is 1 in 109 people.  At 2.58 people per household, that is 1 in 42 families had someone saved by a gun. Not believable.
@AlecA82475839 @denny63177874 @davidhogg111 The argument that we should not do anything to stop the unique level of carnage in our country because people are killed in cars is a false argument.  We have safety equipment in cars to help save lives. People die by slipping in the bathtub. So lets not do anything about guns.
@AlecA82475839 @denny63177874 @davidhogg111 The intended purpose of motor vehicles is not killing people.  But that is the purpose of firearms.  If motor vehicles were banned, our civilization would collapse. If firearms were banned, more people would live each year and there would be no collapse.
@denny63177874 @AlecA82475839 @davidhogg111 During the time your gun, stored under lock and key in your home during the day,  didn't kill anyone, other guns killed 42 other people (not including suicides).  Most killings were people the gun owner knew, like wife, husband, family member.
@AlecA82475839 @denny63177874 @davidhogg111 Gun owners are willing to trade off thousands of unnecessary deaths each year for their hobby, their choice of investment??, accuracy challenges. Cold.
@AlecA82475839 @denny63177874 @davidhogg111 Do you have a reference to this estimate?
@denny63177874 @davidhogg111 Ammo sales would not be illegal but controlled. The existing rounds will get used over time.  And individuals who do their own loads would have to get a license to buy explosives if they don't already. Private ammo makers are, I assume, in business and would have to obey the law.
@denny63177874 @davidhogg111 What are your objections to keeping your guns and not killing thousands of people each year?
@denny63177874 @davidhogg111 shooting range.
@denny63177874 @davidhogg111 ....but you can't take any rounds home with you.  Nobody should be able to buy enough rounds to shoot up a school or kill people with automatic fire from a hotel room in Las Vegas. And it would not interfere with legal gun use.
@denny63177874 @davidhogg111 I propose that the regular checks be applied to purchase a gun. But buying ammunition would required a license. Purchases should be limited to a few rounds and you should have to return the empties to buy more.  You can buy as many as you want at a licensed range.....
@denny63177874 @davidhogg111 Seriously? The impact on society is that there are thousands of dead people each year. Most of the things you mention do not involve ammunition. Most of the rest do not require a box of 1000 AR-15 rounds. Recreation at a shooing range would be a good control point for ammunition.
@firefly909 @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Lets face it. He is critically short of clues.  One could almost say he is clueless.
@realDonaldTrump Many People are retired seniors and really hate your rip-off Medicare Advantage plans. Bernie and the Democrats understand what universal health care would mean to people and the savings that it would produce.
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump But is it more than would be spent by everyone on healthcare if it isn't enacted?  That is the issue.  would universal health care reduce the overall cost to our society of health care and would good health care be made available to more people.  The answer is yes and yes.
@AimeeDearmon @realDonaldTrump Not a Trump supporter are you?

@denny63177874 @davidhogg111 Bullets are not just linked to gun deaths.  No bullets, no gun deaths.  But even if everyone drove sober, there would still be automobile accidents.  It is a price society pays for the benefits of transportation. What societal benefits offset the thousands of shooting deaths.
@denny63177874 @davidhogg111 BTW: Half of all automobile deaths are caused by following too close.  So statistically half of the tailgaters are driving drunk.
@denny63177874 @davidhogg111 We do control the sale of alcohol. We have a federal agency that is responsible for The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. But people who die from alcohol do it to themselves. People who are murdered don't do it themselves.

@RielAssociates @nowthisnews Correct.  We have no idea what the shape is. Certainly is shape is affected by other taxes collected by other levels of government.  Political philosopher Ibn Khaldun isn't running around selling the idea to greedy politicians.
.@realDonaldTrump Can you spot the village idiot? https://t.co/xRYXr0sJO6
@RielAssociates @nowthisnews @realDonaldTrump We don't know what the optimum tax rate is but we are well below that rate because the last tax cuts reduced government revenue on a nearly one to one basis. The tax cuts are intended to blow up the deficit followed by claims there is no money for Medicare etc.
@RielAssociates @nowthisnews The Laffer Curve plots tax receipts against tax rates. Arthur Laffer theorized that both 0% and 100% tax rate would yield no taxes. 100% would kill the economy. Somewhere in the middle was a maximum at some undefined optimum tax rate. This idea has been used to justify tax cuts. https://t.co/ldUxG9h99x
.@realDonaldTrump  @stevenmnuchin1 The truth about what the rich did with the Massive Trump tax. https://t.co/AR2AliW0bC Trickle down economics doesn't work.  It just creates massive deficits which the rich do not pay for.  You do through reduced services, and bad infrastructure.

@Truprthorn @Gunner062357 @_uptowngirl33 @mp3cjak @FoxNews But I am right about the Electoral College.  It was created to protect the people from their inability to think critically and the tendency of people to vote for personal advantage. For example, to vote for candidates that promise lower taxes even when that is not a good idea.

You are lying about all steel plants closing. Even if they were all to close, there is not "they" to charge us unreasonable prices because there are hundreds of steel producers in tens of countries all competing for business. Our steel industry shrank because it didn't modernize.
Major importers and even major users of steel, imported or domestic, test samples to make sure the product is as represented by the material certifications.  People can go to jail for providing false material certs. This was a problem in the aircraft industry for steel bolts.
Who is this "They" that were so horrible to Brett Kavanaugh.  How was he treated badly?  He was asked questions that he refused to answer.  Boo Hoo! Poor Brett.  BTW: Was he drunk while he was giving testimony?
There is not such thing as "dead steel".

@realDonaldTrump You nominated Brett Kavanaugh to the supreme court because he was a slimy, lying, evasive weasel and quite possibly a rapist?
.@JohnCornyn You have offered absolutely not evidence that Dr. Ford's actions are part of an orchestrated attempt to delay the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh.  There would have been lots of time for a proper FBI investigation of all allegations against Brett Kavanaugh. SHAME!
.@LindseyGrahamSC Your speech to the committee verged on the incoherent and certainly one sided.
@LindseyGrahamSC You didn't point out that Dr. Ford tried to warn the senate about Brett Kavanaugh before he was nominated.
@LindseyGrahamSC Many People believe that the problem is not what Brett Kavanaugh said or didn't say.  It is about the flawed hearing process and the extraordinarily partisan criteria for selecting him as a candidate for SCOTUS.

.@senorrinhatch You are right.  It is a circus. A Republican Circus. The way the Kavanaugh hearing was conducted is a stain on our government and our reputation internationally.  Shame on you. Why are you hell bent on confirming an obviously flawed and corrupt candidate?
@gary4205 @ronb333 @HarrietBaldwin Nobody is forcing black women to have abortions.  What hyperbole. What incredible dishonesty.
@gary4205 @ronb333 @HarrietBaldwin Most abortions occur among the poor. Period. Our society's scandal is that while black people are a minority, most poor people are black.  So if you want fewer abortions, help change that statistic.
@gary4205 @ronb333 @HarrietBaldwin 1.5 million is not even an average.  Where are you getting your information? https://t.co/4m88dGnEz4	Medicine is a multi-billion dollar industry.  Where do you find information about people profiting from abortion?

@LindseyGrahamSC @seanhannity @FoxNews @ChickfilA Aren't you afraid that consorting with Sean Hannity will ruin your reputation?
@LindseyGrahamSC @seanhannity Is @seanhannity still working for the Republican Propaganda Machine?  If he is, the what he has to say will definitely not be the truth or even loosely related to the truth.
.@LindseyGrahamSC The issue is not what people think of the Senate or the process of selecting Supreme Court Judges. The issue is why you are so hell bent on approving and obviously corrupt and dishonest person to the court.
Facts and Truth were sexually assaulted by the Republican Party today during the @BrettKavanaugh confirmation hearing.  But the FBI does not investigate sexual assault cases.  To whom will Truth report the assault?
Many People believe that @BrettKavanaugh is highly paranoid and believes that the Democrats are out to get him. But he has no evidence that is the case which is really poor considering he is a judge.
All we need is a Supreme Court judge that has been arrested on multiple charges of rape and sexual assault.
.@JeffFlake Many People hope that you will act honestly and vote NO to confirm Brett Kavanaugh.  He is not who we need on the Supreme Court.  This nomination is a mess and there is no statutory limit for the behavior he is accused of in Maryland.
@hughhewitt @LindseyGrahamSC @JohnMcCain @BenSasse @SenateGOP John McCain is probably spinning in his grave. The tactics that must be rejected are the hiding of relevant information about Kavanaugh. If he is so great, why hide all those documents and why release  documents the day before the hearing?
.@LindseyGrahamSC Was it 4 or was it 5? Time to ask Spanky to clarify precisely.
@FoxBusiness @LindseyGrahamSC Many People agree that it was a sham.  Without and FBI investigation and without calling all of the relevant witnesses (that Kavanaugh kept lying about), it is a kangaroo court.  This is the end of the Republican party if the rank and file Republican voters have a conscience.
.@LindseyGrahamSC You should be ashamed of yourself.  A brown nose is not becoming.
@realDonaldTrump Was it 4 or was it 5?
@realDonaldTrump He blamed the Clintons!!  HE BLAMED THE CLINTONS!!!
.@BenSasse So the letter didn't get sent to the committee when you think it should have.  Many People think that the committee should have had access to all of Brett Kavanaughs documents but the Republicans have decided to hide.

@gary4205 @ronb333 @HarrietBaldwin If you don't like abortions, try promoting better tax laws and reducing the wealth gap between rich and poor.  Promote better sex education in schools.  Promote better schools in poor neighborhoods.  All the things that Democrats promote and Trump has rolled back.
@gary4205 @ronb333 @HarrietBaldwin First get your numbers right.  In 2014,  652,639 abortions were performed in the USA. So you are 848,000 of.  If you lived in 1990 with1,429,247, you would be closer. One of the driving forces for abortions is poverty. Fewer poor people means fewer abortions.

What the Democrats did was not illegal and if it was intended to upset the election, why wasn't it used?  It would have sunk Spanky's campaign.
@Cryodaddy @realDonaldTrump No Uranium went to Russia.  What the Russian company bought was  production capacity and it probably was not interested in the US mine.   Uranium One had a large mine in Kazakhstan. The mine in Utah produces  less each year.
@Cryodaddy @realDonaldTrump The figure is in the article referenced.
@Cryodaddy @realDonaldTrump Why would anyone bribe Secretary Clinton to get this piddling bit of production.  Hillary Clinton MAY have approved the sale along with 8 other state and federal agencies.

@realDonaldTrump Suppose an average of 100 people die in a community each week.  But then suddenly the number is 300 people per week for two weeks.  If something like that happened authorities would look for a cause for the 400 excess deaths. That is the method used by GWU. It is common practice.

@RoseDaddyMike @GChumpsky @FoxNews Enjoy the Koolaid.
@RoseDaddyMike @GChumpsky @FoxNews No Uranium went to Russia.  What the Russian company bought was production capacity and it probably was not interested in the US mine.  Uranium One had a large mine in Kazakhstan. The mine in Utah produces less each year.
@RoseDaddyMike @GChumpsky @FoxNews Why would a Russian Company pay Hillary Clinton who ran the State Department MAY have approved the sale along with 8 other state and federal agencies.  See the attached article. It is baseless conspiracy theory like Obama's birth place. https://t.co/YmqNV31Sj3
@RoseDaddyMike @GChumpsky @FoxNews Another Koolaid drinker.  The chart attached shows the source of the Uranium we use in the USA.  8% of consumption is produced domestically.

@GChumpsky Want a bet!!
@GChumpsky You are assuming that the election was fair. I think that there is a lot of evidence for the conspiracy theory (example: Trump Tower meeting) but I think it may be easier to convict for RICO violations. No matter who investigates or for what, we see Russian mobsters looking back.
@GChumpsky Not sure what that has to do with liberals being insane.
@GChumpsky And you have not idea what is coming next and apparently not what happened during the campaign.  One guy just went to jail for lying to the FBI about his contact with an Australian diplomat during the campaign. Manifort scammed a bank in 2016, while he was working for Trump.
@GChumpsky You are right.  You are not a legal expert.  Conspiracy is collusion between two or more people to undertake an action against a person or organization.  But unless you have a spy in the Mueller org, you have no idea what he is investigating.  My guess is money laundering &amp; RICO.
@GChumpsky Trump gets A+ from someone on his handling of hurricane disasters.
@GChumpsky I don't think that it true.  People may apply for asylum for those reasons but I doubt very much it is granted for those reasons.  That is more Republican Propaganda.  Generally, people do not walk hundreds and thousands of miles to avoid stuff like that.
@GChumpsky Others have.  His plan didn't have anything to do with what happened to Facebook.  It just grew.  His wealth is on paper.  But his company pays him $5.77 million/year in salary alone.  That is $2800/hour assuming an 40 hour week.  What does he do to EARN $2800/hr.  He doesn't.
@GChumpsky Voter ID would be a good idea if the government paid the cost of issuing the ID cards.  But old or poor people without a drivers license or other government issued ID are not allowed to vote.  There is no VOTER ID Card anywhere in our country.
@GChumpsky Sanctuary cities started because local governments didn't want to pay the cost of enforcing federal immigration laws by arresting illegals and holding them for Immigration to come to get them.  The dream act is an attempt to recognize the facts on the ground.
@GChumpsky Is your employer privy to your "work" schedule?
@GChumpsky The 1% have grown rich from policies that have negative consequences elsewhere in the world but they don't want to pay the true cost of their profits.  That is greed.
@GChumpsky And many of the poorly educated that arrive at our border were driven to make the journey because of US farm subsidies that have dumped corn at below production costs and destroyed the farm industry in poorer nations.  The broke farmers and farm workers come here to survive.
@GChumpsky More republican bullshit.  I don't want open borders. But as an extreme centralist, I believe that we are our borther's keeper and that we can and should offer sanctuary to oppressed people if they ask for it.  Not all asylum seekers are uneducated.  There are doctors etc.
.@steveblair17 Yes it is. Please share this web page.  https://t.co/5wfVE4K4Dk
@GChumpsky He has not been accused of consiracy. But there is evidence that his campaign workers, including his son, met with Russians that they expected to be government representatives with dirt on Clinton.  That is established fact and attempting conspiracy  is also a crime.
@GChumpsky @ibrake4ants I asked the question but you have no answer.  Lots of people of all political stripes charge fees for speaking. People with experience in high office get to charge more.  The Secretary of State's husband is a former President of the USA.  Your accusation is baseless innuendo.
@GChumpsky You are the one that has associated insanity with liberalism.  Not me. You made it a political issue.  You are the one that is fomenting hatred against liberals, not me.  NOBODY ever said they wanted open borders. It is a Republican chant that they dishonestly attribute to Dems.
@GChumpsky Employees take a risk when accepting a job.  Many companies go bankrupt.  Do you think that Mark Zuckerberg is rich because he made a huge financial investment?  He started in his dorm room.  He is taking the wealth created by his employees.
@GChumpsky Do they employ you to tweet in the middle of a work day? I am retired so I only have to answer to my wife.
@GChumpsky Bullshit.
@realDonaldTrump @USNationalGuard I hear that hurricanes are very wet.
@GChumpsky @ibrake4ants Why are speaking fees an issue?  Trump isn't accused of trying to work with Russia to improve relations. He is suspected of conspiring with the Russian Government to influence the 2016 election. That is illegal. I agree that both Russia and the US broke promises to Ukraine.
@GChumpsky You would agree that Timothy McVeigh was insane even though he was definitely not a liberal.
@GChumpsky Then you agree that political extremism, either left or right, is a mental disorder.  It is not restricted to liberals.
@GChumpsky So you believe that the common good is best served by having large portions of our population being poorly educated because of where they live.
@GChumpsky Think of the country as a BBQ where everyone is invited.  But 1% take half of all the food and leave 99% to fight over the remaining half.  Who is greedy? Who should be in control? The 1% or the 99%? More food is brought in. The 1% takes 55% of that. Who is greedy?
@ibrake4ants @GChumpsky I think arguing with GCumpsky is pointless.  He/She is obviously a Trump supporter and like Trump, impervious to logic or facts.
@GChumpsky @ibrake4ants Trump had not choice. Congress made sanctions the law of the land but Spanky dragged his feet. No channeling required.  The previous administration did the opposite? Really? Clinton tried to improve relations but it didn't work. Obama imposed Crimea related sanctions.
@GChumpsky No but the death threats to the kids and families of the kids who are gun control activists are political.  They are not being threatened by liberal, pro gun control people.  They are being threatened by right leaning mental cases, emphases on mental cases - not normal people.
@bluemoon_row @realDonaldTrump If our products are expensive, they won't buy them. They will go elsewhere as they did with soybeans.  If we go elsewhere it is to a supplier that is more costly than Chinese products before tariffs. So we lose. It is a death spiral that we cannot win.
@GChumpsky Two children go to school. One (r)lives in a rich neighborhood and one (p) in a poor neighborhood.  R gets a better education than p. Attempts to provide the same quality of education to all is blocked by the wealthy (Republicans) as socialist (a boogie man). Who is greedy?
@GChumpsky Not wanting to pay taxes to support the common good is greed.  I am not sure envy enters into it.  Running up a deficit to give allow the rich to avoid paying taxes is greed. We have to pay our way.
@GChumpsky @ibrake4ants "Arming Eastern Europe" is not against Russia but against Russian aggression. Do you think Trump wants to sanction Russia? Implementation of the Congress Approved sanctions took a long time &amp; was watered down by Trump. Fuel to Russian customers counters weaponized Russian supply.

@PressSec @realDonaldTrump Thank you Obama for putting the economy back on track and thank you Spanky for not finding a way to screw things up - yet.  I am sure you will manage because all recessions result in wealth transfer to the rich.
@realDonaldTrump No it isn't.  It may be feared but it sure isn't respected. You are an international joke.

@TheRicolaJingle @Progressive_Pol I live in Houston.  I am aware of the lack of zoning laws.  It is the bane of the existence of the citizenry.  Do you attribute the lower cost to minimum wage or the fact that there are no income taxes and simply oodels of land for building plus the oil industry. Black Gold!!!
@Voix_Dissidente @realDonaldTrump Absolutely hilarious.  Thanks for making my evening.
.@RandyRainbow Could you do a song to the tune of "She has Betty Davis Eyes" but for Devin Nunes. "He had Devin Nunes' Eyes" https://t.co/QK9BflPnme
@TheRicolaJingle @Progressive_Pol How about Atherton, California? And you need to compare average incomes, not the minimum wage because in your argument, anyone making above the minimum wage is causing unemployment as well.
@TheRicolaJingle @Progressive_Pol In economics there is a saying that usually accompanies a theory.  "Caeteris paribus." For you collection of stats to mean anything you have to compare to a city in American of a similar size and a similar makeup of people and industry and either a higher or a lower minimum wage.

@TheRicolaJingle @Progressive_Pol And I drive a blue car.
@TheRicolaJingle @Progressive_Pol It says nothing about what you want.  You argued that low wages make for a better economy so why not take it to the logical limit.  It's nice to know that you know the words "ad hominem" but you don't seem to understand what they mean.  Now that is an ad hominem attack.
@TheRicolaJingle @Progressive_Pol So have you told your employer to reduce your wages yet?
@realDonaldTrump One would think that a stable genius would have figured out after the Access Hollywood incident that you should not tell reporters things you don't want others to know.  Telling others what you say is their job, genius! https://t.co/b1eXuvqcK1
@realDonaldTrump But you are also planning to cut Social Security, aren't you.  And you will use the huge deficit you have created as a reason to cut it.  Many People cannot afford to save for retirement because they are paid minimum wage and have more than one job just to eat.  You are insane.
@TheRicolaJingle @Progressive_Pol I think you make a good economic case for slavery.  People who work for minimum wage are subsidizing otherwise uneconomic activity.  If the employer cannot pay a decent wage, it is not a viable enterprise.
@TheRicolaJingle @Progressive_Pol Are you willing to make the sacrifice for your country and accept the minimum wage so that more people can be hired by your employer?  Ask around and see how popular that suggestion is with the people you know.  BTW: do you have a reference for the 60,000 figure?
