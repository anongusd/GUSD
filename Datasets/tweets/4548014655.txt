This fellow honestly deserves nothing less than either or a combination of the Order of the Baobab and the Order of Luthuli. May your tireless efforts in uplifting a black child be recognized and appreciated during your existence for such requires acknowledgment.#Inspired #Moved

@peace_inourland @Mahlabanemp @ngungunyana @samkelemaseko @It_is_Thato @MYANC @mgigaba @Radio702 But how can even it be “negligence” when a complaint was never laid in the first place? It would perhaps be negligence if indeed a complaint was received by the office and no further steps were taken.
@peace_inourland @Mahlabanemp @ngungunyana @samkelemaseko @It_is_Thato @MYANC @mgigaba @Radio702 But was there a formal complain directed to the then pp regarding this? Remember, PP cannot just “investigate” out of the blue. A formal complaint needs to laid

Phambili with Robust Dialogue and Away with sweet flowery monologue -cum- dialogues that leave listener either confused then before or leave one in a position where no substantive insight was gained. #PowerPerspective #Power987 #RobustnessAllTheWay
Listener primarily because of how robust the discussions are on this programme. I’m tired of listening to interviews that are flowered don’t really bring any substantive information to myself as a listener hence I don’t listen to some other talk radio stations out there.
and bully is far fetched from this reality. The beauty about night radio is that because more time is at the disposal of both the interviewer &amp; interviewee, it allows for a thorough robust of issues and I think as a host, JJ does that perfectly. I am a loyal power perspective

@MduNzima @Sontieago @MasechabaNdlovu Mampintsha might still continue to abuse other women but for him to inflict pain on Babes will be one heck of a mission seeing that he is now under the public radar all thanks to the yesterday’s interview
@MduNzima @Sontieago @MasechabaNdlovu Having both a criminology and Psychology background, the trend is often that when abusers are exposed, the last thing they want to do is to be nailed with abuse claims in future. A sense of embarrassment for their violence deeds overrules them.

@luzy_ramuthaga @Silangwe @FloMasebe because it shows respect for the tribe and is grammatically the correct way of addressing other tribes. I would like to believe that vhaVhenda(is in Vhenda) and baPedi is in Pedi so allow and tolerate amaZulu addressing you properly in their language as well.
@luzy_ramuthaga @Silangwe @FloMasebe What I’m getting from your analogy is that “Zulus” should refer to other tribes in their respective languages i.e vhaVhenda or baPedi. This cannot be correct nor can it be fair.  Linguistically in Zulu, whenever you refer to any other tribe, the “ama” prefix is mandatory
