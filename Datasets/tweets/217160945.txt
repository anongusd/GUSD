Gotta say these 90's throwback jerseys&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ...grew up on them. What do you think?
@CP3 I agree CP, that @blakegriffin Kia "New Dunk Game" commercial is very misleading...
But I digress. I really wanted to pay homage to a truly unique and remarkable rebounder and player in Bill Russell.
@tomhaberstroh well in that game I did my best Moses Malone impression...throw it up and go get it.
@tomhaberstroh ...The game I had 31 rebounds we played a D'Antoni Knicks team who were known for their fast pace style. Working in my favor.
@tomhaberstroh it makes sense. My 3rd year in the league we played at a top 5 pace while I led the league in rebounding at 15+...
@sfwarriorsfan Paul Silas too
@tomhaberstroh I stand corrected. What about Wilt having 100+ 30pts/30rebs games? How many he would have had knowing stats of that era.
RT @tomhaberstroh: .@kevinlove Just a heads up: There were, on avg, 147 available boards per gm in 1960. Nowadays? Just 84. So, 51 board ...
@tomhaberstroh @truehoop or that no one was there to see it...haha
@tomhaberstroh @TrueHoop I still feel like 51 Rebs is 51 Rebs. Kind of like Wilt scoring 100 Pts I don't care if the opposing C was 6-7.
Haha!!! “@TWolvesArmy: @kevinlove but he also said it was about "Buckets" #Wes lol”
Speaking of rebounding @tysonchandler with three straight 20-rebound games. #respect
@APkrawczynski nothing gets by you Jon!
#respect #11rings
2/5/60 Bill Russell Grabbed 51 rebounds. Can't imagine grabbing anything within even 20 of that number.

Nothing like being back in the home you grew up in, with the family, all sharing GOOD times and laughs.

@Mnlp33 when we do start playing again, I want to make sure you are there with your kids.
@DanielAndert Yes. Yes. Yes.
@Mnlp33 anything I can do to change that?
We know how important the fans are, and apologize for those who work for NBA organizations who are directly impacted by this.
@B_Grant_ and we do, it's very disheartening for everyone involved. Top to bottom. Many people's livelihoods are at stake due to this.
Apologies to the fans, we hope you can understand us.
@jreed_MCBNE see, that was my thought process too...
