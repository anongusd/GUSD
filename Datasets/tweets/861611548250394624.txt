During the hearing, Chairwoman @RepJudyChu commended SBA for working through the backlog of loans and emphasized the need for continued oversight, and to prevent future government shutdowns.
Last week, SBA provided the Committee with an update of its lending activity since it resumed full operations on January 28. After four weeks, SBA approved over 7,900 loans for a total of $3.7 billion, and it has now returned to pre-lapse levels in all its lending categories.
Today, Subcommittee Chair @RepJudyChu held a hearing to examine how @SBAgov dealt with a backlog in loans due to the shutdown. For many small businesses, SBA‚Äôs flagship 7(a) loan program is a lifeline for affordable capital when they have trouble securing it elsewhere. https://t.co/Pct1yNuWCN

Chairwoman @NydiaVelazquez is committed to ending the #TrumpShutdown. One reason is @SBAgov's 504 program helps #SmallBiz acquire real estate &amp; new equipment. A shutdown prevents the disbursement of approximately 117 of these loans/week, a weekly total of over $102 million.
In 2017, 80 percent of retailers that redeemed SNAP assistance were considered small businesses. 		The #TrumpShutdown is threatening to take food away from hungry families while hurting small grocers. Enough is enough. #EndTheShutdown 		https://t.co/jEpDnYT9CD
The #TrumpShutdown is hurting the #SmallBiz economy by preventing @SBAgov from granting loans. The 504 loan program alone is being delayed by over $20 million per day of the shutdown.		.@realDonaldTrump must stop playing politics with America‚Äôs entrepreneurial workforce.
Every day of the #TrumpShutdown, small firms lose out on nearly $90 million in loans through @SBAgov‚Äôs flagship 7(a) program, that‚Äôs 192 #SmallBiz loans going unprocessed PER DAY. Congress and @realDonaldTrump must accept the House passed Democratic funding bills &amp; reopen gov't.

Small Business Development Centers coordinate programs to help #SmallBiz owners and entrepreneurs. A #TrumpShutdown would hurt SBDC's ability to plan events, offer counseling and would delay loan applications.
Many small businesses know all too well that the holiday season is a busy time to sell their products and bring in revenue. Yet a #TrumpShutdown will create economic uncertainty with furloughed federal workers and less spending. Congress must keep the government open.
Last time there was a #TrumpShutdown, Democrats wrote a report showing the negative impacts on small business owners &amp; entrepreneurs. Whether ceasing lending through @SBAgov to furloughing gov't assistance workers, a #TrumpShutdown is bad for #SmallBiz. https://t.co/Tdthbmi3jb

Ranking Member @NydiaVelazquez‚Äôs new report shows one thing‚Äîthe GOP‚Äôs failure to pass a long-term budget hurts America‚Äôs small business. The subsequent uncertainty hurts firms bidding on government contracts, seeking capital and more. Read the full report: https://t.co/Fcilt11OiC
The bottom line? Shutting down the government will have dramatic impacts to the economy, hardworking Americans, and the small business community.
A #TrumpShutdown prevents federal agencies from entering into any new contracts, including those with small businesses. On a daily basis, a shutdown could cause small firms to forgo approximately 6,875 contract actions worth $301,656,083.
Small Business Development Centers coordinate programs to help #SmallBiz owners and entrepreneurs. A #TrumpShutdown would hurt SBDC's ability to plan events, offer counseling and would delay loan applications.
With over 850,000 potentially furloughed employees all over the country, small firms will lose business and most importantly, confidence in the economy. #TrumpShutdown
A #TrumpShutdown means that popular 7(a) and 504 loans would cease to be issued. In the 7(a) program alone, a shutdown would reduce capital to small firms by $110 million per day.
If Congress fails to pass a CR and opts for a #TrumpShutdown instead, funding for disaster loans will run out the first week of February. With millions of Americans recovering from hurricanes, wildfires &amp; mudslides, cutting off loan funding is the last thing they need.
To answer your questions about the impact of a #TrumpShutdown on #SmallBiz we‚Äôve compiled a report &amp; will be highlighting the facts. Check out the full report here: https://t.co/L9TWpgJQGR
