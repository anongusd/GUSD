King was right that even the worst, most racist original Founding Fathers (there are other founders throughout our history), could not consider, address, or legislate anything concerning liberty without at least setting forth or accessing the truth of liberty: It must be for all.
In his "I Have a Dream" speech at the Lincoln Memorial, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., described his movement as coming to cash a check written into the Declaration of Independence and Constitution, to which all Americans fall heir. Washington (among others) signed that check.
George Washington fought and served as president of the United States to establish an explicitly racist Constitution and government, but also to help design a nascent revolutionary democracy, which, when its guarantees are extended to all, truly can be called Washington Libertas.
I get arguments that Washington was a slaveholder and shouldn't be honored, but believe the juxtaposition of "Washington Libertas" (both historical names of the school) as I propose it moves beyond George Washington to describe a design of American liberty to be extended to all.
A joke on my college alma mater, Washington and Lee University, about a name change away from R. E. Lee: "Let's say it's named for Denzel and Spike." I'm asking it to be Washington Libertas University by or before Oct. 2020, 150 years since Lee was added. https://t.co/N8YhhjFT0E

@MaryWills612 @shannonrwatts For example, doing everything she can with her power, experience and influence to impeach Trump and Pence, remove them from office and bar them from all future office. We should say it to all Democrats and Republicans and hold them all accountable for their results. No passes.
@MaryWills612 @shannonrwatts I don't think so, because we need her to act now, and she has somewhat of a record of overmoderation on some issues in the face of needs for immediate action. I encourage every Californian or American to let her know what they want and let her know now, while she can act.
@MaryWills612 @shannonrwatts Feinstein is likely in her last term, to which she was just reelected (with my vote), as she pointed out herself, instead of listening. She has all the time she needs and every reason to listen to her constituents above all. I'm proud of those kids and whoever shared the video.
@MaryWills612 @shannonrwatts I have voted for Feinstein all five times I was able to vote for her (before that I was too young to vote), so I'm not against her or joining a mob against her. But it is never wrong to tell your representatives what you want, or to do better. They work for us.

@DC_Thucydides It's been an interesting conversation (eventually). I knew before I made this public call to rename the University I would face criticism, so I'm hardly surprised you would try to insult me without knowing much of anything about me, and it's fine with me.
@DC_Thucydides You will find large flaws researching that time of his life, too, and again, he asked not to be memorialized in this way.
@DC_Thucydides @JamesAGagliano @CNNOpinion Lee is on my résumé. Changing the name of the school won't change that. Changing the name of the school, as I outline, shouldn't mean removing Lee from its history or his remains from campus. As with any historical figure, we can study him and defend him where he was right.
@DC_Thucydides @JamesAGagliano @CNNOpinion There are certainly admirable things about Lee and his life, especially in his own historical context, but he was right, he saw far: memorials to him have become a needless flashpoint of politics and intolerance and have been used to advance hatred and division.
@DC_Thucydides @JamesAGagliano @CNNOpinion Washington Libertas is a historical name for the University, as well as illustrating, as I've proposed it, that while this nation was not open to freedom for all at its founding, the American identity of Washington Libertas he helped establish now stands for freedom for all.
@DC_Thucydides @JamesAGagliano @CNNOpinion Hilarious, but Washington, Lincoln and Jefferson did not request multiple times that they should have no memorials, and they were also presidents of the United States, founded (imperfectly) on liberty. There are flaws in all of them which factor in to how we memorialize them.
@DC_Thucydides @JamesAGagliano @CNNOpinion It was not free, it was a full-tuition scholarship.
@DC_Thucydides @JamesAGagliano @CNNOpinion Lee requested no memorials for himself or his side in the Civil War. After nearly 150 years of disregarding his clear, even visionary wishes, the University should return liberty to its name as it moves forward, and place Lee in context, as Mr. Gagliano suggests for West Point.
@DC_Thucydides @JamesAGagliano @CNNOpinion I learned a lot about Lee and Washington and Lee University history as a Robert E. Lee Honor Scholar there and have learned more since.
@DC_Thucydides @JamesAGagliano @CNNOpinion I stated that Washington and Lee formed a history commission prompted in part by events in Charleston and Charlottesville, which has produced results on campus already. You said there was no relation between those events and W&amp;L, but that's the relation. You can look it up.

@DC_Thucydides @JamesAGagliano @CNNOpinion I just told you Washington and Lee decided to reevaluate its own history with members of its own community, in part prompted by Charleston and Charlottesville.
@DC_Thucydides @JamesAGagliano @CNNOpinion I first started commenting privately to the University when it asked for comments with its recent history commission, instituted after Charleston and Charlottesville prompted the University to study its commemorations and make several positive changes on campus.

Again, Horton Plaza had trouble with tenants, security and changing parking policies for years, which led to its closure. So this is not due to my campaign about theater marquees and access. But it does mean there's now just the one theater I know of with this problem locally.
It has little to do with my advice, but the sign problem has been cut in half now that Horton Plaza closed Jan. 30. I'm very sorry for all who lost their jobs. But now #sandiego moviegoers need only avoid Edwards San Marcos till they fix their signs. #TurnOnTheMarqueesRegal /END

@jlms_qkw And as the opposite of slavery, it is the progress the University needs now. (We've always had libertarians there, too, and they should be welcomed to embrace the change as much as anyone else.)
@jlms_qkw Also "Washington Libertas University" should be able to be accomplished quickly as it fits right in with other aspects, symbols and traditions of the University.
@jlms_qkw And the University can't be Washington Liberty because of Liberty and West Liberty Universities.
@jlms_qkw Yes, but it is (1) the ancient Roman goddess of freedom represented as a freed slave spreading her light to the world, (2) historical to the University, (3) beautiful, (4) equally "code" for liberals, liberators, libertines, librettists and librarians, i.e., not confined.
Simpy using the power of his voice and spirit in a brief, uncredited role, Cecil M. Henry's performance elevated "The 15:17 to Paris" to an excellent work of art. I refuse to consider how I might have rated it if he had not. He is 2018's best supporting actor. 3.5 of 4 stars.
I'm calling for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to suspend all nominations for Best Supporting Actor and designate this year's winner by acclamation as Cecil M. Henry, the inspirational speaker in the trailer and movie "The 15:17 to Paris." https://t.co/QTqt6D0yy3
Washington and Lee University under its current president and board has taken many good steps, as has the University over the years, to increase minority enrollment and deal with the historical legacy of Lee and slavery. But it is still named after Robert E. Lee. That's wrong.
Is the University planning catering for a 150th anniversary banquet of renaming Washington and Lee after Robert E. Lee to kick off the academic year in October 2020? Or statue and painting unveilings for a rededication of the University to freedom and liberty and against slavery?
Will the University recognize its moment and the importance of our national moment for the school? It's just about 150 years since the school was named for Robert E. Lee. Every day I was on campus from 1994 to 1998, maybe 10-20% of men wore "confederate"-themed W&amp;L gear. Enough.
I'm NOT saying Lee or all his family or his horse Traveller (all buried at Lee Chapel) should be removed, it's a gravesite and beautiful historical place. It's time to remove all other honors and images of Lee to their serious historical context and crown the Chapel for liberty.
Rename Lee Chapel "Libertas Museum and Lee Family Crypt." Put a plaque on the front of the building dedicating the Libertas statue to enslaved people held by the University, George Washington, Robert Lee and the nation, to those still held in slavery, and to all Native Americans.
These enslaved people were not really property, they were really people who lived and died at Liberty Hall Academy and Washington College. Washington and Lee is a great and beautiful school, and a statue of an African American Libertas on the spire of Lee Chapel would be right. https://t.co/Lr3UrlnSqR
Before and after Washington gave stock to expand Liberty Hall Academy (later Washington College, then Washington and Lee, after Robert E. Lee headed the school after the Civil War), Africans and their descendants were enslaved in Virginia, held by W&amp;L, George W. and Robert L.
I don't believe it could be called cultural appropriation for Washington and Lee University to rename itself Washington Libertas and remove Robert E. Lee from the name and insignia of the University, replacing him with an African American ideal of Libertas, goddess of freedom.
I've been urging my college alma mater, Washington and Lee University (named in part for past head Robert E. Lee), to combat racism and white supremacism by changing its name to Washington Libertas University as soon as possible, within months, not years, before or by Oct. 2020. https://t.co/U5Lg6gimxF

That's enough journalism from me for now.
I found multiple photos of apparent racialized dress-up as many different racial and ethnic groups, and two "confederate"-uniformed student photos in Washington and Lee University's 2008 yearbook. https://t.co/YahejtczAx
I found at least five "confederate"-uniformed student photos in Washington and Lee University's 2007 yearbook, one with R.E. Lee portrait, and one photo which may show people in apparent blackface. https://t.co/YahejtczAx
@RaleighReporter And again, I could not tell if make-up was used in the instances I refer to as "redface" and "brownface," though they seem to be racialized dress-up instances.
I found many "confederate" battle flags (not counting old GA flags), 2 photos of a person in basketball outfit and curly dark wig and 3 "confederate"-uniformed student photos in Washington and Lee University's 2005 yearbook. Some photos may show blackface. https://t.co/YahejtczAx
Four more Washington and Lee archived yearbooks to go through, 2005-2008, and I'll have reviewed the most recent 15 years of yearbooks I can see, through 2009. Holy goodness. https://t.co/YahejtczAx
I found "confederate" battle flags in the background of a two photos of students and a "confederate"-uniformed student photo in Washington and Lee University's 2004 yearbook. Another photo shows a person in a pillowcase mask resembling a Klan hood. https://t.co/YahejtczAx
@keithboykin I've now also found apparent blackface in the 2001 and 2002 Washington and Lee University yearbooks.

@bpkbeachlady @HoarseWisperer @JeffBezos @washingtonpost I do, the point I am making is that it is in the interest of @JeffBezos, the @washingtonpost and the nation, at least until Trump and Pence leave office, for there to be no paywalls, for anyone online to be able to read their news stories. Democracy dies in darkness.
I found what appear to be two photos with three people in blackface, and one person in a "confederate" battle flag shirt, in Washington and Lee University's 2001 yearbook. https://t.co/YahejtczAx
@keithboykin CORRECTION: I'm correcting this to say, "apparent blackface." That's what it looks like.

@stetayen @pbump I can get to it. But @JeffBezos and the @washingtonpost and America have a large interest in their dropping news paywalls completely at least until Trump and Pence resign or are impeached, convicted, removed from office and barred from all future office. #putinrunstrump

"Democracy dies in darkness" is not just an ironic thing to say when you have a paywall up, or a joke, or a slogan. Democracy dies in darkness, @JeffBezos.
Jeff Bezos should drop the @washingtonpost news paywall until Trump and Pence resign or are impeached, convicted, removed from office and barred from all future office. This may sound like I want something free, but it's really just very good advice to Jeff Bezos and the Post.

@snazzystella Thanks! Here's the original capsule review I wrote. The actors' rapport is the best thing about it: "Green Book" is Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen as pianist Don Shirley and his driver on tour in the sixties Deep South. 3 of 4 stars.
@snazzystella I liked it as a movie in itself, but, like "Bohemian Rhapsody," and probably more egregiously than that, it gets history wrong. So it is troublesome, and more to Don Shirley's family. I don't vote for Oscars, but neither of these should be awarded as "best." 3 of 4 stars each.
RT @clairecmc: The press conference did not help. Made it worse. Our party is united in asking for resignation.
Washington and Lee University under its current president and board has taken many good steps, as has the University over the years, to increase minority enrollment and deal with the historical legacy of Lee and slavery. But it is still named after Robert E. Lee. That's wrong.
Is the University planning catering for a 150th anniversary banquet of renaming Washington and Lee after Robert E. Lee to kick off the academic year in October 2020? Or statue and painting unveilings for a rededication of the University to freedom and liberty and against slavery?
Will the University recognize its moment and the importance of our national moment for the school? It's just about 150 years since the school was named for Robert E. Lee. Every day I was on campus from 1994 to 1998, maybe 10-20% of men wore "confederate"-themed W&amp;L gear. Enough.
I'm NOT saying Lee or all his family or his horse Traveller (all buried at Lee Chapel) should be removed, it's a gravesite and beautiful historical place. It's time to remove all other honors and images of Lee to their serious historical context and crown the Chapel for liberty.
Rename Lee Chapel "Libertas Museum and Lee Family Crypt." Put a plaque on the front of the building dedicating the Libertas statue to enslaved people held by the University, George Washington, Robert Lee and the nation, to those still held in slavery, and to all Native Americans.
These enslaved people were not really property, they were really people who lived and died at Liberty Hall Academy and Washington College. Washington and Lee is a great and beautiful school, and a statue of an African American Libertas on the spire of Lee Chapel would be right. https://t.co/60e7gWg5yw
Before and after Washington gave stock to expand Liberty Hall Academy (later Washington College, then Washington and Lee, after Robert E. Lee headed the school after the Civil War), Africans and their descendants were enslaved in Virginia, held by W&amp;L, George W. and Robert L.
I don't believe it could be called cultural appropriation for Washington and Lee University to rename itself Washington Libertas and remove Robert E. Lee from the name and insignia of the University, replacing him with an African American ideal of Libertas, goddess of freedom.
My alma mater is W&amp;L, Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia, and I'm asking Ralph Northam @RalphNortham @GovernorVA to resign right away, and for my University to rename itself as Washington Libertas University as soon as possible, within months, not years. https://t.co/s7spMtvK0L

@jelani9 @RalphNortham @GovernorVA I don't believe it could be called cultural appropriation for Washington and Lee University to rename itself Washington Libertas and remove Robert E. Lee from the name and insignia of the University, replacing him with an African American ideal of Libertas, goddess of freedom.

I'm autistic, I started wondering if I was in the AMC Stubs, Stubs Rewards, AMC Premiere, Standard Preferred Untorn Stubs, because I think I am in one of those, then I was like, I will go somewhere else now, @AMCTheatres. Your system is extra-rude because it is crassly arranged.
And if you're going to have two lines for "members" and "others" for tickets, you had better have at least two cashiers and lines working. Three or four snaking lines with different labels, I'd rather @Netflix and chill, @AMCTheatres #sandiego. What a mess, very unfriendly.
I'm not necessarily saying anything about whatever preferred-customer or rewards programs at movie theaters, but @AMCTheatres Mission Valley was kind of a mess tonight. There are like three roped lines to stand in for snacks for various tiers so it's crowded, confusing and rude.

@AMCTheatres @GlassMovie @IMAX Please let me know when you end your terrible, unfriendly two-tiered public lines for tickets and concessions so I can return to enjoying movies at #sandiego @AMCTheatres. You will not see me giving you any money or thinking of your theaters as friendly places until then.
#SanDiego #movie theaters to avoid if you expect all customers to be treated in a friendly way: @RegalMovies San Marcos and Horton Plaza, all @AMCTheatres.
@AMCTheatres If you cannot design a rewards program which does not create visible discrimination reminiscent of the ugliest kind, as a business open to the public, you are incompetent and un-American and deserve to go out of business, in my opinion. Children go to your theater and see that.
@AMCTheatres Your two lines for tickets and concessions in #sandiego are hideous and rude. They make me feel nauseous. So why would I watch a movie there or buy snacks there when I would just feel sick? Please let me know when your theater is working right again so I can return as a customer.
I was just about to buy a ticket and a large popcorn @AMCTheatres when I noticed their two lines, one for customers who pay extra, one for those who don't. Luckily I realized in time how sick I would feel eating popcorn at a theater with that policy. I complained and walked out.
Now @AMCTheatres has two lines for tickets and concessions, like a d— airline. First I was thinking, well, airlines do it, why couldn't movie theaters? What's the big deal? But then I came to the conclusion that it is so revolting that I could not give them money till they stop.
A bigger part of my job as a #sandiego #movie critic lately is to let movie fans know which local theaters are not friendly to customers: @RegalMovies San Marcos and Horton Plaza are inaccessible to many disabled people as they do not post movie times and titles by theater doors.

I'm convinced a 2020 Democratic ticket of two of our best women leaders is best to defeat any likely GOP ticket. Not just because they are women, but because so many are among our very best leaders and candidates to win the White House.
I'm supporting Kamala Harris for president. In bad times it also makes me a proud American that women like Carmen Yulín Cruz, Tammy Duckworth, Kirsten Gillibrand, Amy Klobuchar, Ayanna Pressley, Elizabeth Warren and more have risen to be our best, most dynamic leaders today.

We have records which show he sent three older brothers with six good arms to war for the South, welcomed back only one with one arm left. Was of age to serve but there are no records of that, just a biographical sketch from later in his life noting that his father-in-law fought.
But only because I'm not sure if the one who looks like he may have run really ran.
I guess I'm proudest of the one who surrendered? : )
Now I know nearly every branch on the Southern side of my family had at least one soldier in that generation, my great-great-uncles, some died, some were injured, one was a private in an Alabama regiment with Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia at Appamattox Courthouse.
Kind of crazy I had no idea so many on the Southern side of my family fought on that side of the Civil War and I had never investigated it. I looked through our family records book many times over the years and only knew of two great-great-uncles who died and looked no further.

Another great-great-uncle, brother of the two I knew,who died within 10 minutes of each other in battle, lost his left arm to Civil War wounds. Their other of-age brother may have lit out West. I have ancestors named for Franklin, Hale, Jefferson, Madison, Jackson and Calhoun.
Looking up my two great-great-uncles I knew died fighting on the wrong side of the Civil War and found another set of two great-great-uncles who did the same, and another rebel great-great-uncle paroled at Appamattox Courthouse when Lee surrendered. #southerngenealogy

Gah! There it is now. https://t.co/eJJEtjyKT7
You could place a statue of Libertas right over Lee Chapel, and call it Libertas Museum and Lee Family Crypt, or put it in a central place on campus where it can be widely seen, like the freaky-looking old George Washington central spire statue on the colonnade.
I would much prefer an image of slavery ending opposite a portrait of George Washington to the current portrait of Robert E. Lee, to represent my alma mater, Washington Libertas University.
Another bonus of changing the name of Washington and Lee University to Washington Libertas University is that it presents the opportunity to build a beautiful statue or sculpture of Libertas, goddess of freedom, usually shown as a freed slave, for use on university insignia.
Washington and Lee University should repudiate terrorist racism, white supremacism and white nationalism by retiring Lee's honor in the name of the school and becoming Washington Libertas University, a name which directly confronts Lee and slavery without necessitating a new URL.
But I digress. #ImpeachTrumpPenceNow @MittRomney.
RT @MrGeorgeWallace: Shout out to folks teachin' their kids kindness and respect.
Washington and Lee University (formerly Liberty Hall Academy) in Lexington, Virginia, should be renamed as Washington Libertas University. It's coming up on the 150th anniversary of its being named for Robert E. Lee, and that's more than enough of an honor he's gotten already.
I saw Yolanda King, Spike Lee and Pat Buchanan speak at Washington and Lee University, in Lee Chapel where Robert E. Lee is buried, before his marble statue "recumbent on the battlefield" (love that phrase, yes). I was a Robert E. Lee Honor Scholar. It's time to change the name.
Things have changed there since I attended, there's an office of LGBTQ support (whereas I was one of only one or three out gay students in my first years there, and founded the second student LGBTQ support group ever by myself by founding a magazine and printing an ad for it).
I don't know if any of you have ever been to Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia, but it is one of the oldest and most beautiful college campuses in America and a fine school. I graduated in 1998 and have not been back. The campus has expanded since I've visited.

To end on a hopeful note, I believe there is a clear majority of Americans who see this much more clearly than the media presents with its coverage of both sides. We can still hope and work on it together. That's where to focus this Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Moving forward.
Now Trumpism is a national emergency and has been since the beginning, and we do and we don't know what to do about it. It hasn't gotten better, it has gotten much worse.
White supremacy, white nationalism, racism, all synonyms for Trumpism, are evil and wrong. For me and many other people, for most of our lives, we knew of racism and anti-Semitism and other hate ideologies' consequences in real people's lives but hoped and worked for better.
I grew up in America from 1976 to 1994 in Georgia, Utah, Idaho and California and had friends, neighbors, classmates and family members of pretty much every race, religion and national origin in all of those places at all of those times, and I still do. Group hatred is poison.

RT @magi_jay: let us not forget that, less than a week ago, Trump mocked Wounded Knee on twitter.
Also, as I said, it was never among the very best movies of 2018.
Like the Golden Globes, the Producers Guild of America let a huge wet fart awarding "Green Book" as "best." It's an okay movie in itself, but made egregious mistakes within the movie representing Don Shirley and in its promotion which let everyone know it is not among the best.

Also y'all, you can keep impeaching them even if they resign and still convict and bar them from all future office, and it's surely best in the cases of Trump and Pence.
Maybe moving ahead on a solo Trump impeachment would work, maybe there'd be pressure for Pence to resign for various reasons before conviction, maybe he would, but if I picked I'd say write an impeachment resolution naming them both, Pence whether serving as president or v.p.
Seems like it'd be a waste to evict Trump from the White House but not Putin. Clean it up.
Well, I'm probably getting ahead of everything, but I see this as important. Maybe Pence would resign or something and it wouldn't even be an issue.
@TheRickWilson Do you see much value in a Trump solo impeachment as opposed to a Trump-Pence double-header? Why trade one puppet for another? If Senate GOP signal eagerness to convict Trump on impeachment articles, shouldn't Democrats say, "Pence has to go at the same time"?

@jerblack @IlhanMN You may be correct now, but developments are moving fast. Democrats should not try to impeach Trump alone, it's a waste of time. They must wait till Senate GOP is begging to be rid of Trump, then demand Pence must go at the same time. We cannot keep a puppet in the White House.
@nadinevdVelde @MrJonCryer Trump and Pence must be impeached together and receive a simultaneous trial, so they are removed and barred from all future office by the same vote. Putin does not care if he runs the White House through Trump or Pence. #putinrunstrump #TrumpRussia #ImpeachTrumpPenceNow

I was wrong, you can switch back to "Legacy Twitter," and I appreciate the honor.
I was planning to wear a hat today before I even knew it was #NationalHatDay. #karma
So it seems like if you just zoom your browser out a few times, New Twitter is about the same as old Twitter with minor annoyances like everyone having to redesign their profiles. But...how do I get back to old Twitter? That's right, there seems to be no going back. Be aware.
Fmr. Amb. @CarolineKennedy has won the first two overall poll rounds of my poll of the best Democratic candidates to win for president in 2020. I don't know if she'd run, maybe she will. You can vote in the first round of the new poll for a few more hours. https://t.co/s22MmqJy7P

Being a senator is a big job with big pay and benefits. If they fail America by failing to effectuate in any of the legitimate ways available to them the removal of Trump and Pence from office, they should leave office themselves and find other work.

Caroline Kennedy is the only daughter of President John F. Kennedy and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy. She has never run for or held elective office but was part of a key endorsement of President Obama in 2008 with other family members, and served as Obama's Ambassador to Japan.
Caroline Kennedy wins this round of voting, not just the daily round, but with each of the eleven names in the poll having rotated through. I don't know if she'll run for president in 2020, but she could, and for winning the first round she'll lead the poll in the next.

Of course the Affenpinscher is no more related to monkeys than any other dog, it's just a funny nickname for the breed. I did not find a monkey species commonly referred to as doglike, or a "dog monkey." If Trump were mad at a monkey, he'd call it a dog monkey on Twitter.
There is a monkey terrier, the Affenpinscher.

I wouldn't give Trump's and Pence's problems to an Affenpinscher on a rock. "Solved that comedy problem," he thought to himself after tweeting, swiping his hands together, symbolically clean in the air.

Of course @MittRomney could do a lot, but it takes a nation to impeach simultaneously the president and vice president or force them to resign in the face of impeachment, removal and being barred from all future office under the United States. #ImpeachTrump #ImpeachTrumpPence
Congress has to get together, all of them, on how to move the United States forward from here. If they do not do this soon, it will just be the worse for them and us. I'm not saying impeach Day One (January 3) but get together to get America's act together. #ImpeachTrumpPence
The longer Congress waits the more damage is done to our nation, its people (who are us and who are real people paying for all of this), and our Constitution. #ImpeachTrump #ImpeachTrumpPence #ImpeachTrumpPenceNow #ImpeachAndReplace #TrumpRussia #putinrunstrump #goonsquad
Of course @MittRomney can't do it alone, if he even wants to, he'd need 20 loyal friends in the Senate GOP caucus (and all the Democrats in the Senate and House to agree), to really pressure Trump and Pence to leave, or remove them from office. But no delays should be brooked.
I'm not ready to name @MittRomney Dudley Do-Right, I'm calling him Senator Flake, but if he does stuff right I'll be glad. BTW, the right thing to do is to impeach, remove and bar from future office Trump and Pence simultaneously within a reasonable amount of time from Thursday.

The odds are long, Romney might not even be solid for impeachment himself if he makes no friends in the GOP Senate. We still have to hope developments in the new year move public opinion solidly toward impeachment without destroying earth, our only home.
CORRECTION: I said @MittRomney needs 18 solid friends in the GOP Senate caucus to join him to impeach Trump and Pence (or provide a credible threat of impeachment if they will not resign). He needs 19. 20 Senate Republicans including Romney must join all Democrats to impeach.
@grantstern @DjRodgers1231 You are right. I was not thinking of Hyde-Smith. 20 it is.
@DjRodgers1231 @grantstern 48 + 19 = 67. Need Romney + 18 for Republicans.

If there's anything that troubles me a bit about the @MittRomney op-ed, it's if Romney wants Trump to leave the presidency...to Pence. That's a no-go. Democrats shouldn't even be bothered to pass any impeachment resolution which is not a simultaneous impeachment of Trump &amp; Pence.

I don't mean to say a lot of nice things about @MittRomney. He has a chance to show himself a leader. Oh, yeah, another nice thing about him is he kind of resembles Robert Mueller.
@cliffschecter @MittRomney's set the stage to have a shot to show himself a real leader. If he fails, he only humiliates himself and lets down the nation.
@JoohnnyLove @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump It's not faith, @MittRomney has set himself up to rise to the occasion if he so chooses. If he won't, he fails his own test he set for himself along with letting down the nation.
