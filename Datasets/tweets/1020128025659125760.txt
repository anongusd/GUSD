In '09, an election in Burlington, Vermont using Ranked Choice Voting failed to elect the candidate preferred over all others. RCV was repealed the following year. The era of settling for mitigating the problems is over.	https://t.co/okSFCQRkmp https://t.co/TF8Ue7phVG

The bill—included as part of a package called House Resolution 1—would also build upon Oregon's automatic voter registration program and require states to register to vote any resident who provides information to the local motor vehicle authority.

@JFCarterVT Burlington did enact RCV in 2009 under the false pretenses that it solves the Spoiler Effect. It was repealed after the first election was spoiled. You need STAR Voting.
@under_just @RepAndyVargas @TSubtext STAR Voting was invented to deliver on the goals of RCV, while addressing it's flaws. https://t.co/aJUtmmZNLn
@RashidaTlaib @Ocasio2018 Want unity? Join with AOC and the team. Easy!
@ILforRCV @ChampaignVoters We're excited for the enthusiasm but worried about misinformation on what RCV can and can't deliver. RCV can and does waste some votes. If your favorite isn't going to win but is viable, your next choice may not get counted. That's why it was repealed in Vermont.
@drjodypalmer RCV only eliminates vote splitting if the 3rd + candidates are non-viable. If you want a viable 3rd party you need STAR Voting!
@kennethmejiaLA People have been so programed not to vote their conscience for fear of wasting their vote that it's like PTSD. Even when there's no risk of vote splitting people still do it, like dogs who flinch when you pick up the newspaper. We need STAR Voting!
@under_just @RepAndyVargas @TSubtext RCV can and does waste your vote. If your 2nd choice is eliminated before your 1st your ballot is "exhausted". RCV doesn't solve the Spoiler Effect, it fails in elections with 3 or more viable candidates, and it was repealed in VT after a failed election? Fact check FairVote!
@RepAndyVargas Did you know that RCV doesn't solve the Spoiler Effect, it fails in elections with 3 or more viable candidates, and it was repealed in VT after a failed election?
@CShentrup @Rob_Richie @nardopolo @johnharvey_math @1RAOKADAY @fortenforge @baseballot More specifically: If your favorite is a strong underdog who you don't think can win, in a race with 3 or more viable contenders, it's not safe to put your favorite as your first choice. That can cause your ballot to get wasted, so your vote doesn't count in the final rounds.

@Rob_Richie @nardopolo @johnharvey_math @1RAOKADAY @fortenforge @baseballot This is where @Rob_Richie could make an actual case if they shared data specifically from IRV in races with 3 or more viable candidates. The only study I've seen like that showed that IRV fails 1/5 times, or worse with more viable candidates.
@Rob_Richie I agree that RCV should inspire higher turnout, but this election has high turnout across the board. I'd love to see actually statistics from a proper scientific study.
@USATODAY @lessig @usatodayopinion It's the opposite. Voting for your 2nd choice can't hurt your favorite, but that comes at the expense of the statement you made. With RCV voting for your favorite can absolutely hurt your chances of getting better representation. That's happened in VT where it was then repealed.
@USATODAY @lessig @usatodayopinion Hi Lawrence. I saw your recent article and am also excited to see more fair voting methods on the national stage, but one quote jumped out as me as an error. 		 "And more importantly, voting for their number one would not weaken the chances of their number two winning."
@Rob_Richie @johnharvey_math @1RAOKADAY @fortenforge @baseballot Great! Thanks for the info and congrats on the precedent.
@Ultrademocracy STAR is more accurate than Score in a wide range of scenarios - see https://t.co/AZwTycBJwP . This simulation uses neither “puffed up” nor pulled down. Just fully honest votes using the full range.
@25forcongress IRV elections in Australia and Ireland are still 2 party dominated.
@25forcongress STAR Voting uses a 5 star ballot and it stands for Score Then Automatic Runoff. It's counted using basic addition not algebra so it's more logistically viable, more constitutional, it better insures that your vote isn't wasted, and it's safer to vote your conscience.
@25forcongress Hi Kenneth. Have you heard of STAR Voting? Oregon reformers are working on STAR because RCV doesn't actually eliminate the Spoiler Effect if the 3rd candidate is actually viable. Despite what FairVote says. It's been described as a 3 party glass ceiling.
@LarryDiamond Hi Larry. Thanks for covering voting reform. Have you looked into STAR Voting. It's like RCV, but with a 5 star ballot.
@Hugh_McNichol @Rob_Richie I encourage you all to consider STAR Voting as another option. It it more logistically viable, more constitutional and this scalable, and it's also more accurate and more strategically resilient. STAR uses a 5 star ballot.
@EddieZipperer You ballot is your vote, not just some or one of your rankings.
@Rob_Richie @baseballot If there is a majority winner then absolutely, but if there is only a plurality after 1st choice votes then we are looking for the majority coalition. It's an important distinction because there may be more than 1 coalition with a majority if we were to look at all the rankings.
@johnharvey_math @1RAOKADAY @fortenforge @baseballot Was the winner in the Maine election the Condorcet winner? Will we get to look at the full rankings and ballot data?
@Ultrademocracy Well, actually...
@ekklesiagora @Ultrademocracy It makes it feel safe to vote for them, but then if the underdog is almost viable it might not count your next choice rankings. It's been described as the RCV glass ceiling.
@CShentrup @ctcabin @micahphones @CountedWA @ElectionScience Agreed! Plurality is the worst! Equal Vote supports RCV where it's been adopted to replace "Choose-One-Only" ballots. RCV laid the foundation for a movement. Now it's time to reach for the stars!
Wish there was a fair and accurate voting method which allows you to vote your conscience without fear if wasting your vote? Get involved with STAR Voting now. 	https://t.co/L6C8woQQvU
@CShentrup @ctcabin @micahphones @CountedWA @ElectionScience Transparency is an drawback for RCV, as results can be confusing, votes can't be locally tabulated, not all ballot data is counted, and tabulation can take weeks.  Results then can't be displayed with a simple tally showing how much support each candidate got overall.
@CShentrup @ctcabin @micahphones @CountedWA @ElectionScience Or request for years has simply been that critiques remain factual and not misleading. That would allow us all to focus on a reasonable assessment of the options, pros, and cons. Reformers deserve to have all the info.
@FairVoteWA @jonmetzler Washington has a law in place that there needs to be a Top2 general election. This excludes RCV from general elections all over the state. The groups #Counted and #EqualVote are looking into initiatives to adopt STAR Voting or Score Voting for primaries.
@UrbanPoliticsTO @FairVoteWA @TorontoRaBIT The thing is that there can only be one true majority, but there can be more than one coalition with a majority. Unless we count all the rankings we can't know if the largest majority coalition won or not. Is FairVote or Maine planning on releasing the full ballot data?
@fairvote @PressHerald Unfortunately in Burlington, VT voters learned the hard way that isn't always true. Luckily this Maine election didn't have the fail scenario, but voting your conscience with RCV *can* backfire and help elect your worst case scenario.
@Aarondklein Have you heard of STAR Voting? It delivers on the goals of the other options, but without the tradeoffs. Safe to vote your conscience, never wastes your vote, fair and accurate.
@fairvote @Rob_Richie Not true. RCV is more accurate than the Choose-One-Only ballot but falls short compared to most other options. No matter what measure of accuracy you prefer this claim doesn't hold water. Voter Satisfaction Efficiency, Baysian Regret, Condorcet...
@Rob_Richie @gailcollins That's why single winner RCV has failed to end 2 party domination where it's been used the longest in places like Ireland and Australia. 		Rob needs to stop playing loose with the facts.
@Rob_Richie @gailcollins RCV does NOT solve the Spoiler Effect. STAR Voting, Score Voting, Approval Voting and other methods do. 		RCV only eliminates spoliers if there are only 2 viable candidates in the race. If there are more than that it can and does still fail a significant percentage of the time.
