"Questions have been raised about whether I know of direct evidence that Mr. Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia," Michael Cohen says. He says: "I do not."
"Mr. Trump is an enigma. He is complicated, as am I," Michael Cohen says during testimony. "He is both good and bad ... but the bad far outweighs the good and since taking office, he has become the worst version of himself."
Michael Cohen says Trump is Individual-1. ‚ÄúLast fall, I plead guilty in federal court to felonies for the benefit of, at the direction of, and in coordination with Individual #1. For the record: Individual #1 is President Donald J. Trump," he says during his testimony.
Michael Cohen says "I am ashamed of my weakness and my misplaced loyalty - of the things I did for Mr. Trump in an effort to protect and promote him." He adds, "I am ashamed that I chose to take part in concealing Mr. Trump's illicit acts."
Michael Cohen says "never in a million years did I imagine when I accepted a job in 2007 to work for Donald Trump that he would one day run for the Presidency. To launch a campaign on a platform of hate and intolerance and actively win."
"I recognize that some of you may doubt and attack me on my credibility," Cohen says, adding, "it is for this reason that I have incorporated into this opening statement documents that are irrefutable and demonstrate that the information you will hear is accurate and truthful."

"We're right in the middle of a sort of a meltdown on the part of the Republicans," Nancy Pelosi says when asked by a reporter to describe the current state of negotiations over government funding and a potential shutdown.
"I don't know that anybody ever has any assurances from the White House on any subject -- including this one," Nancy Pelosi says when asked if she has gotten any assurances from the WH that Trump will sign stop-gap funding bill to avert a shutdown.
"Republicans are in a state of disarray. We don't know what will happen next," Pelosi says at her press conference referring to where things stand on the shutdown fight.

"I think a government shutdown is not a good option. That's my view," McConnell says. "The American people don't like it."
McConnell says he is ‚Äúin consultation with the White House about the way forward," in the shutdown fight. "We‚Äôll have more to say about that hopefully a little bit later about what the President is willing to sign,‚Äù he says, adding that the admin has been ‚Äúextremely flexible‚Äù
"I would never use Nancy Pelosi as my source for legal authority on probably anything," Sanders says on potential for re-programming funds "I would use attorneys who work here at the White House and in agencies where that's their entire job determining whether something is legal"
"We know that Russia tried to create chaos within the election, but certainly not that they actually impacted it. The only reason the President is the President is because he was a better candidate and beat Hillary Clinton," Sanders says during press briefing.
"The Senate has thrown out a lot of ideas. We are disappointed in the fact that they have yet to actually vote on something and pass something," Sarah Sanders says at the briefing. The Hill meanwhile has effectively been waiting on Trump for clarity on where the President stands.

Obama said today of his relationship with McCain: "We never doubted the other man's sincerity or the other man's patriotism, or that when all was said and done, we were on the same team."
In an interesting moment from today, Obama said he used to invite McCain to the White House just to talk. "We didn't advertise it, but every so often over the course of my presidency, John would come over to the White House and we'd just sit and talk in the Oval Office," he said.
"The America of John McCain has no need to be made great again because America was always great," Meghan McCain says during a speech remembering her father. The line met with applause inside Washington National Cathedral.
"We gather here to mourn the passing of American greatness," Meghan McCain says in an emotional speech in memory of her father. "The real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly."

"I think the endorsement is disgusting, absolutely disgusting," Trump accuser Samantha Holvey says of Trump's endorsement of Roy Moore.

"in some areas of our society people are being held accountable for unwanted behavior, but we are not holding our president accountable for what he is and who he is," Trump accuser Jessica Leeds says.

but seriously, don't listen to anyone who says they know what this means for 2018. they don't.
but they do add to a pattern of Democrats outperforming Clinton's margin in some recent special elections, suggesting strong Dem enthusiasm.
None of this means the results will be predictive of anything.
Also worth noting that Handel, who got the most votes of any Republican, seemed reluctant to embrace Trump (though she expressed support).
Hard to say what will happen in the runoff. Ossoff may lose if GOP voters coalesce around his rival Republican Karen Handel.
Trump meanwhile did far worse than Romney in 2012. Trump got 48.3 percent of the vote in November, while Romney got 60.8 in the district.
that's significant since Clinton had already done better than Obama in 2012, losing to Trump only by 1.5 percentage points in November.
Ossoff didn't win outright, but he got a higher vote share than Clinton in a district held by the GOP since the 70s. https://t.co/TTg4grVt2t

Trump says the public doesn't believe the media anymore, then adds "maybe I had something to do with that."
Trump says he's not ranting and raving, he's having a good time, but the media is going to put out headlines saying he's ranting and raving.

Trump started this speech saying he wants to unify the country, then attacked the media as dishonest, and said the nation is drug-infested.
Trump says his administation is working "night and day" to keep people safe, then points at the press and says "including reporters."
Trump says we're going to have a "wall that works" not like what we already have at the border, which he calls a joke.
Trump says "we're becoming a drug-infested nation" and "drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars."

Now Trump is talking about how the crowds at his upcoming rally will be massive. Remember this is an event that hasn't taken place yet.
Trump says the media is not happy that he is following through on promises he made.
Trump is now talking about how many electoral college votes he got, and how he exceeded expectations.
Trump says his conversations with foreign leaders have been "far more productive than you would understand."
