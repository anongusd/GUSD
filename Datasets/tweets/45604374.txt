Nadler says Judiciary Committee will take a 5 minute recess in its hearing with Whitaker - and appears to stun Whitaker, who apparently was anticipating a longer break.  "I get 5 minutes for lunch?"   There was no immediate reply from Nadler.
Nadler, as Judicary chairman, gives himself added time. Whitaker ultimately says: " "We have followed the special counsel's regulations to a 'T'. There has been no event, no decision that has required me to take any action. And I have not interfered in any way" with Mueller probe https://t.co/htWwIJq0lu
Watching the clock: Nadler asks Whitaker if, as acting attorney general, he has he been asked to approve or take any action with regard to the special counsel? Responds Whitaker: "Mr. Chairman, I see your five minutes is up," of the usual time-limit protocol per questioner.

Ranking Judiciary Committee Republican Doug Collins lets loose at start of Whitaker hearing: "We're going to have plenty of theatrics," he predicted. "We're going to have a show... dog and pony show -- let's get it out! This is the most amazing thing."
Whitaker, show his prepared opening remarks, will say he plans "to continue the longstanding Executive Branch policy and practice of not disclosing information that may be subject to executive privilege, such as the contents of deliberations or conversations with the President. https://t.co/0rnToDnzu4
Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker is planning to refuse to answer a congressional committee's questions in a Judiciary Committee hearing Friday about his conversations with President Donald Trump, citing executive privilege if he has to.
Sanders: Fact that 'Nadler would try to force the public disclosure of private conversations that he knows are protected by law proves he only wants to play politics,' &amp; he should focus on helping the American people, rather than wasting time playing pointless political games' https://t.co/8tDzFZC5nE

clarification, Meadows is top republican on that subcommittee....Government Operations. https://t.co/cjtp9jlVZO
Jim Jordan, Ranking Republican on House Committee on Oversight and Reform, and Mark Meadows, top Government Operations Subcommittee member, sent a letter to Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray requesting a briefing about the tactics used to arrest Roger Stone.
Probably right, but this WAS a custodial situation -- he clearly could not have simply walked away. And we really do not know what he was asked, and may have answered -- such as to, 'where is all the incriminating evidence' =- although they knew he was represented by lawyers. https://t.co/aikXiTyppQ

Holding forth in a Washington hotel ballroom, Stone tells reporters, 'I did not coordinate anything with the Trump campaign or with WikiLeaks about their disclosures. My purpose was to hype the disclosures to bring voters' and media attention' to them. 'That's called politics.'

Senator Merkley responds on floor by saying that the message to Ford and the other women who came forward is that "The U.S. Senate was unwilling to hear them out."
Manchin also backing Kavanaugh, as Graham says on the floor about the accusations against the judge: ""This is as close to McCarthyism as I hope we get in my lifetime."
"The one thing you wouldn't do is be intimidated, the one thing you wouldn't do is play politics with the life of Judge Kavanaugh" says Graham to Collins -- adding he wished his old colleague Senator John McCain would have been here to see it.
McConnell on Collins' speach: "It was absolutely inspirational." Graham follows by saying that she "rejected the mob rule" for the rule of law, and said he can only imagine what kinds of pressures she came under.

Cruz gets O'Rourke visibly mad, angry several times during the debate. In a race where the nice guy is running against that nasty guy --- turning the nice guy into an angry guy on TV helps Cruz.
Cruz and O'Rourke are asked what they admire about the other. O'Rourke praises Cruz's hard work, dedication. Cruz says the same about O'Rourke, but then back-handedly also says O'Rourke like Bernie Sanders truly  believes in expanding government. "True to form," quips O'Rourke.
For the fourth time in the debate -- O'Rourke mentions he has visited each of Texas' more than 250 counties... a standard line prompts Cruz to finally quip to him, "Representing Texas is not doing a photo op in each county with reporters in tow."
O'Rourke repeats that he defends the 2nd amendment but also wants to assure "that we protect the lives within our lives." He seems to be back on his heels on the issue of gun control.
"Of course I support the 2nd Amendment," says O'Rourke during the debate. "I fully support the 2nd Amendment."
During Texas Senate debate, Beto O'Rourke angrily responds to Ted Cruz: "I did not call police officers modern-day Jim Crow."
Schiff says the FBI and Justice Department have said of some of the material now being ordered declassified and released by Trump regarding Page warrant other matters they  would consider "a red line that must not be crossed as they may compromise sources and methods."

"I told some of the other guys he's really good -- he's lying, and he knows he's lying," said Gohmert of Strzok's repeated claims that he did or does not have bias, despite the context of his texts.

But Dems complain he did not go to the 2nd one for two reasons 1) he had to be in Houston for a fundraiser; 2) he did not want to be confronted by Schumer, Pelosi, Warner, Schiff about the behavior of Nunes. Do not know how true. https://t.co/6F4Nxxi6fp
Warner had earlier similarly complained, "There's never been a Gang of 8 meeting with a White House presence." https://t.co/PWiBQ99Atr

2) Schiff in a statement added of Flood, "Although he did not participate in the meetings which followed, as the White House's attorney handling the Special Counsel's investigation, his involvement - in any capacity - was entirely improper, and I made this clear to him." ... https://t.co/h3dbuq6Jp2

Earlier, Warner left the meeting complaining, ""There's never been a Gang of 8 meeting with a White House presence," and called the earlier meeting at the Justice Department a "rogue" meeting. He did say Trump lawyer Flood did leave before substance was discussed.
Schiff took no questions after reading the statement. He began by saying,  "Today's Gang of 8 briefing was conducted to ensure protection of sources and methods." https://t.co/LnTh0KpB9k

2) And it may be worse. Jones says he is not alone among House conservatives who will never back McCarthy as Speaker. So McCarthy could face the same obstacle to getting a majority of all House votes, even with slightly larger GOP majority...
1) If McCarthy picked as next GOP leader, and Republicans hold just a one-seat edge after election, he can not win the Speakership in House-wide elections. That requires 50 percent of all votes cast plus at least 1. Walter Jones says he will not back McCarthy no matter what....

4)  "It is beyond troubling" the WH tapped Mr. Kushner to meet with the Mexican prez this week, writes Connolly. who notes the delegation is being tasked  with conducting "sensitive discussions on security, immigration, and trade relations between the United States and Mexico."
3)  Connolly, who is the top Democrat on the Subcommittee on Government Operations, noted that last week the Washington Post reported officials in at least four countries, including Mexico, have discussed ways to take advantage of Kushner.
2) Connolly urged the panel’s chairman, Trey Gowdy, to hold the emergency meeting in a letter, urging him also to subpoena Kushner about why he still does not have a permanent security clearance, after a year.
1) House Oversight Cmte should convene an “emergency meeting” to discuss lack of permanent security clearance and the conflicts of interests of Jared Kushner, the president’s adviser and son-in-law, who’s leading a U.S. delegation to Mexico this week, according to Rep. Connolly.

Schiff's rebuttal memo would not need another House Intelligence Committee vote to be sent back to the White House if just redactions are made to meet the FBI/Justice concerns; but it might need a committee vote if there are substantive revisions to it.
House Intel only voted to release this version. Rewriting, redactions, must go again before the entire committee. So, too, would  decision to send this memo, as is, to the full House, in a kind of override vote. Not Schiff's decision, alone. So, WH letter blocks immediate release https://t.co/nPYIWr7BFh
Exactly. My point. Had he and DOJ -- the executive branch -- not highlighted areas of concern, would have been released. Now, the entire committee must convene to decide on way forward, if at all. Schiff can't decide on own. So, blocked, for now. https://t.co/nPYIWr7BFh
2) Actually, the president, or McGahn, sent the memo back  saying Trump would re-consider if changes sought by DOJ, etc., were made. The committee must decide on its next step. But like "blocked" traffic or legislation vetoed, there are ways to get around or override. https://t.co/NABibeQImU
1) Marty, you're the best. But here, I think we are reporting the Schiff memo's release was "blocked," for now, compared to the quick release of the Nunes memo in this process. We await how the committee will respond. https://t.co/8yvSqu3GC9

Schiff on FBI Director Wray:   "I'm very proud -- and the director would probably wish I would not say this -- but I am very proud the director is standing up for the bureau," including Wray's statement about the Republican memo.
Schiff said he believes Deputy AG Rosenstein -- not Mueller -- will be the target of a Trump firing. And Rosenstein being replaced by "a yes man for the president" is his concern, said Schiff, because that person would be Mueller's boss and could limit Mueller's investigation.
Schiff says 'unlikely' Mueller would seek indictment against Trump, and choose to let "12 jurors sitting somewhere" to decide on a case. Says a presentment to Congress, laying out facts, for possible impeachment proceedings, would likely be the path Mueller would take, if needed.

Democrats do cheer and applaud when Trump says one of his biggest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs.
The repeated jingoism in Trump's speech is prompting automatic cheers from Republicans, regarding the military, the national anthem and veterans. But Democrats, for the most part, are not standing and applauding.
Once again,  Markwayne Mullin sitting on the Democratic side of the House chamber for the speech. So, when this Oklahoma Republican stands up and cheers, which is often, he stands out. He is sitting next to Tulsi Gabbard, who seems cordial to him.

We are also checking with the Senate Majority Leader's office to see if Durbin mis-characterized the speaker's call last night to McConnell -- providing, that is, if they don't say the very claim about a call, itself, was a lie. Ryan's office does not do that. https://t.co/eK4JqxyH0t
I, too, have asked for clarification on whether the Speaker's office is saying this is not true. https://t.co/bshiWArFzL
Hey, just got out of House Rules Committee meeting. Looking for a response then to Durbin -- did the speaker not make the call last night to McConnell that Durbin describes? https://t.co/P3KN09OaCp
Now, if I were to have to decide for some reason on my pay during a shutdown -- I would choose the "pay all that is owed to me later in one-lump sum" strategy. That's what happens, anyway, with biweekly paychecks.
2 approaches being taken by lawmakers regarding their own pay during shutdown. Those like Messer and Poliquin say they will give their salaries to charity -- which now amounts to 13 hours worth. Others say keep their pay, until shutdown is over. Then give it to them in lump sum

Jared Polis says he's offering Dream Act as amendment to House Rules resolution to extend "same-day" authority to allow  immediate action on any eventual spending bill. Authority to be extended through January 28.
3) from that point, Dems say Durbin recounted, McConnell's tone changed. And McConnell then  proceeded to give his "harsh, no-holds barred speech," said Connolly.
2) McConnell took a phone call from Paul Ryan," said  Representative Gerald Connolly of Virginia, in a description echoed by multiple other House Democrats."And in that conversation Ryan told McConnell, whatever you do, do not discuss immigration in the context of funding 	gov't.

Lewandowski testimony concludes before House Intelligence.
So, it seems, Lewandowski had to have more time to "prepare" for any House Intelligence questions that touched on conversations and events AFTER he left the Trump campaign in June 2016. Including, if he talked to the president last night.
3) Asked why Lewandowski did not simply answer any questions about those conversations and events after his departure, King said: "Because he wasn't prepared. For something like this you have to prepare for days and weeks."
2) But King said that when committee questions to Lewandowski began to drift to conversations and events that occurred after his departure from the Trump campaign -- he asked for more time "and said he was willing to come back as soon as possible.
1) Peter King defends Lewandowski: Says he answered every conceivable question regarding conversations and topics up until his departure from Trump campaign in June 2016. He believed that to be the time period about which the committee had called him.
If House Intelligence Committee called more witnesses to testify in public, not private -- refusals to answer questions per White House direction would be more politically complicated, if not embarrassing to White House.
https://t.co/citUSsee8m
Schiff: "I can only say that the Congress of the United States, let alone our committee, cannot allow a precedent where the White House can simply say with no indication of privilege that in a lawful investigation by Congress we're simply going to deny Congress information."
Schiff said Lewandowski stance was in "sharp contrast" to another witness interviewed by the committee Wed -- White House deputy chief of staff Rick Dearborn. "Answered every question we had. Was fully cooperative...Invoked no anticipation of executive privilege."
Schiff said Lewandowski did express "a willingness to come back," and answer questions. He said the refusal was based on him "not being prepared to answer those questions today. He did not attempt to assert any privilege."
Included in the questions Lewandowski would not answer was: "Did you have a conversation with the president of the United States within the last 24 hours where you discussed your testimony?" said Schiff.
Schiff: Lewandowski not answering Intell qs from period after he left Trump campaign, including whether he's talked to Trump about his testimony.
Trump taking Rep. Glenn Thompson, perhaps other lawmakers, with him to Pennsylvania. Promising to have them back for CR vote, says Thompson.

5) After the committee responded by issuing a subpoena, Schiff said 	Bannon's lawyer conferred again with the White House, and was instructed "to refuse again to answer any questions even though he was under a compulsory process ..."
4)  Schiff said Bannon's lawyer told committee at start of his interview Tuesday that he was going to decline any questions concerning any discussions, meetings conversations that took place either during the transition or during his time in the administration."
3)  "This obviously can't stand. We expect to have Mr. Bannon back in, we hope very soon, with a different position by the White House," said Schiff. Conaway, the Repub leading Russia investigation, "The subpoena remains in effect, and we're going to work to get the answers."
2)  "This was effectively a gag order by the White House preventing this witness from answering almost any question concerning his time in transition, in the administration, and many questions even after he left the administration," said Schiff.
1)  The White House instructed Bannon to not answer some questions, on the grounds it wanted him to preserve the possible invoking of executive privilege late on, said Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.
Schiff: WH told Bannon not to answer some questions. Schiff calls it WH "gag order."

2) "If you are part of the White House in any way and you are talking about things that were during the campaign, but it happens to be in the White House, then what? What's the answer? That's the quandary," said Rooney. Bannon had voluntarily agreed to interview, initially.
1) Rep. Rooney on complications amid House Intelligence Committee's questioning of Bannon, as he invokes executive privilege on matters. "I certainly think the committee respects executive privilege. It's when does that attach is the question that is sort of dominating the day?"
Bannon had agreed to testify voluntarily to House Intelligence Committee. But an abrupt pause today in his closed-door interview indicates ground rules might be changing, amid news of Mueller subpoenaing him. A committee subpoena being worked up, too?

8) Grassley then requests tweet correction from Whitehouse: "I would hope you would tweet a correction so that your followers also know it is false." He adds, "And next time, please do me the courtesy of asking me directly, so as to avoid spreading this kind of misinformation."
7)  Grassley complains to Whitehouse: "Your erroneous tweet has since been referenced in the media, and the myth that I took some instruction on the direction of the Committee's oversight work from the President has spread as a result."
6)  What upsets Grassley is that Whitehouse wrote in his tweet above this NYT excerpt: "Who is this Republican Senator 'nudged' by the White House? Is this why full Judiciary hearings have veered in this direction instead of Russia/obstruction?"
5) ...And, then stating, ""Instead, the senator said, the president nudged him to begin an investigation into Hillary Clinton's connection with the intelligence-gathering firm Fusion GPS, which produced a dossier of           allegations about Mr. Trump's ties to Moscow."
4)  Grassley's letter explains how Whitehouse posted an excerpt from a NYT article that reported: "Another Republican senator said Mr. Trump had not 	 urged him to help bring the Russia inquiry to a halt," going on ....
3) In that  letter dated Wednesday, Grassley complains the Whitehouse tweet implies he was an anonymous source for a story in the NYT.  "Your insinuation is baseless," writes Grassley to Whitehouse.
2. Grassley, demand for Whitehouse correction of a Dec. 1 tweet comes in letter attached in court filings made public today in ongoing House Intelligence Committee effort to obtain more Fusion GPS records.

Whether silly distraction, or crucial investigation -- it's a reality. Rep. DeSantis says House committees will interview FBI confidential informant in next few weeks as it looks into Hillary Clinton’s role (or even Mueller's?) in an Obama administration-era uranium deal.
These are most typically violations of House ethics rules -- but in some cases there is alleged criminality, too. Those charges could be  pursued. But federal criminal prosecutors, for instance, typically ask the House to hold off, while they conduct their probes, first. https://t.co/PiPqluO0Oo

Sessions did NOT tell Judiciary Committee it looks like there is not basis to appoint a second special counsel., as some are reporting Rather, he answered Jim Jordan: “I would say it 'looks like' is not enough basis to appoint a special counsel.”
By his refusal to answer, Sessions is only adding to the Republican theory by House Intel Chair Nunes and others that FBI wrongly used unverified dossier claims to gain surveillance that Trump associates were caught up in.
Sessions refuses to answer Jordan on whether the FBI may have paid Trump dossier writer Christopher Steele, or whether the dossier may have been presented to obtain FISA warrants. He says those are questions for Mueller.
Sessions during hearing: "My story has never changed. I've always told the truth," he said.

3) We are dismayed at the sudden aggressive enforcement of the rules and are concerned about negative effects it can have on the media’s ability to do its job.
2) members of the congressional media have already gone through a detailed, thorough vetting process to obtain press credentials. There is no need for more.

The Standing Committee of (Capitol) Correspondents has already sent Capitol Police a letter this morning registering objections to reporters being singled out for harassment, added scrutiny in Capitol.
Reporters at Capitol relaying that officers are harassing them in hallways like never before, stopping them repeatedly for credentials, and can't do their jobs...others in capitol, lobbyists, staffers, tourists, not so much.

Uncertain what exactly was said in the closed-door meeting with Pelosi, Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, and Caucus chair Joseph Crowley (it's not clear whether Assistant to the Leader Jim Clyburn was there). But likely instructive for Sanchez.

Wieters said the umpire initially told him rule applies to runner already on base advancing...but that is wrong. Now, the umpire is changing his tune and saying it is a judgment call -- but that is wrong, too. Nats should have filed protest, but no one in org. thought to do so?
The rule makes no sense if batter's back-swing is allowed to obstruct the catcher from retrieving a ball, either in the dirt, behind him, or on Mars! Wieters is only repeating what he was told by umpire -- wrongly -- that it is a judgment call. No it is not. https://t.co/zDbOo7kf9W
That's not what the rule 6.03(a) states. The ball and play goes dead -- period! When catcher is struck after the batter "swings so hard he carries the bat all the way around.. ...The ball will be dead, however, and NO RUNNER shall advance on the play.” https://t.co/EuGVvmdUpX

Mark Walker, preacher and starting pitcher of North Carolina, has to keep things going for Repubs...but grounds out! It's over! 11-2 Dems!
Down to final out. And Brad Wenstrup of Ohio is up. He, too, is on the House Intel committee. And I think he's stolen the signs and walks.
Steve Pearce gets good wood on pitch, but pops it up. Still, all of southern New Mexico, including my mom in Las Cruces, are proud.
This is it! To quote Kenny Loggins. Republicans down to their last three outs. And Dennis Ross leads things off -- base hit for the Gator!!!
So sad. Republican fans are starting to hit the aisles. I don't think it's the ice cream giveaway.
Tim Ryan of Ohio at the plate again, trying to make a name for himself that is not simply the same last name as the speaker's. Strikes out.
strike zone didn't matter to him, apparently -- swung at pitch four feet over his head. In other words, a pitch about 6 feet high. https://t.co/5PfNF0HTwM
Richmond up again. One man wrecking crew takes a mighty first swing. Then ....scorching line drive to Costello at short, much calmer now.
Hakeem Jeffries at the plate, carrying the hopes of all of Brooklyn with him. at least the 8th district....called 3rd strike. Oh well.
At best it was motion. https://t.co/OzLrhvpZg7
DeSantis just hit the longest single ever recorded. Hey -- Richmond gets the next guy, and that's 6 innings giving up just 2 runs!
Brady goes ahead and takes a wild swing at a wild pitch for a 3rd strike. Really taxing to watch. (OK, I take that back)
Kevin Brady up -- he has a plan at the plate. But he won't reveal it until all of the Triangle Group approves it. (inside tax stuff)
Two innings to go -- and this is where the Republicans, down 11-2, have to start putting things together. Like their equipment in the bags.
Nice 8 to 6 to 5 double play for Repubs, started off by Flake catch in centerfield of Ruiz fly. The 6, wasn't really necessary.
Rooney taken out of game, after apparently hurting himself trying to snatch foul-ball pop from 1st. He's a lead interviewer for House intel.
Linda Sanchez at the plate, gets ovation,  thinks she walks, but ump calls her back with strike! Fake disagreement. 2 pitches later, walks!
Jared Polis gets on base a second time, sort of colliding with first baseman, scamps to 2nd, and gets kind of an RBI. Hard to explain. Fun.
Richmond hits triple over the left-fielder's head -- and everyone around me is disappointed he didn't try to go all the way home. Yep.
Did I just see Costello slam his helmet down after being thrown out at first base? It's like he's really on the Phillies.
Some slick fielding. Occasional hitting. Rowdy fans. And a video message from President Trump. And, more dominance from mound by Richmond.
