3) Trump's latest tweet about his golf course not only used the prestige of the presidency to promote his business - squalid, possibly illegal - but also directly linked the US-UK relationship to his golf courses. Was that some kind of request? Or threat?
2) Trump bought the land for his Aberdeen golf course in 2006 and Turnberry in 2014. By then, no reputable lender wd deal with him. How did he find the cash to buy the properties?

@chrislhayes 12) Trump names people to hate. Haters target those people for murder. It's not as fun to talk about on chat shows as a race hate hoax. It's a lot more dangerous. And the willingness of so many to shrug off the president's words of incitement - more dangerous still. 		END
@chrislhayes 11) No president in US history has vilified individual people as Donald Trump has done. Not since the 1960s have one politician's supporters and enthusiasts been so implicated in so many acts or attempts of political violence.
@chrislhayes 10) William Butler Yeats wrestled with the moral dilemma of words and actions in a 1938 poem. https://t.co/IdsoizchQS
@chrislhayes 9) Words don't kill. But words can inspire killers. "Who will rid me of this meddlesome priest?" was not the answer to a Jeopardy prompt.
@chrislhayes 8) Who knows whether Trump's words inspired Hasson's murderous fantasies. But as with the pipe bombing attempts in October - the targets of Hasson's plans for violence almost exactly overlap with the targets of Trump's highly personal threats and vituperation
And as @chrislhayes - another target on the kill list - rightly observes: all of this comes in a context of the valorization of political violence by pro-Trump talkers. https://t.co/Wotq0r5hCS
6) Hasson's kill list coincides almost exactly with Trump's threat list. Maybe Hasson would have become a killer even if Trump had never mocked Gillibrand as a whore, or threatened Maxine Waters, or demanded "retribution" against NBC ... but Trump did do all those things.
5) Answer: If Bernie Sanders had repeatedly threatened Rep Steve Scalise with harm ... well, then, I *would* blame Sanders, even if I could not exactly prove the chain of causation from Sanders' hypothetical threats to a Sanders supporter's bloody actions.
4) That point goes approximately as follows. "A left-wing gunman shot at Republican members of congress playing baseball in June 2017, badly injuring Rep. Steve Scalise. If you don't blame Bernie Sanders for James Hodginkson's attempted murder, don't blame Trump for Hasson."

My mistake in the below thread. Hasson was arrested February 15. The detention memo was filed Feb 19 - and first reported by @gwupoe yesterday https://t.co/0BPsk8FZvg
It's a bad day for a narrative of Trump victimhood. https://t.co/FuuDqETiZF
I wonder if President Trump has offered even a private word of solidarity to the Trump critics targeted for murder by Christopher Hasson?

I never believed the Smollett story, not for one minute. A noose is a symbol, not a weapon. The weapons deployed against the targets of Trump's calls for retribution have not been symbols, but real bombs and guns. We all should dread that one day, one will do real harm. END https://t.co/uBUT2FUeD4
I haven't glanced at my mentions yet, but I am sure they are replete with chiding already: "How can you blame Trump for this lone nut? And one about Jussie Smollett's fake hate crime - isn't that more important and revealing?"
Trump fantasizes about violent retribution ... one of his admirers concocts a murder plot ... and when thwarted -which thank God to date they have been - it becomes bad form to mention the possibility of a connection between Trump's words and his supporter's actions.
Last October, another would-be killer sent pipe bombs to a dozen other targets of Trump's incitements. Fortunately, nobody was hurt. President Trump's reaction? He doubled down on *more* incitement, blaming the targets for the bombs. https://t.co/K4Nj5MhdmF
And this latest story? A foiled mass terrorist scheme by a would-be killer who hoped to emulate Norway's Anders Breivik? We're so used to these horrors that it was reported on the Washington Post home page this morning ... as Local News. https://t.co/xs9IoUa16Y
As you await the Mueller report, please remember how many of Trump's worst offenses against American democracy have taken place in full public view. Inciting violence against political opponents? It's not some clandestine plot pierced by investigators. Trump ... tweeted it out.
So it goes through the roster of names: Don Lemon, Chuck Schumer, etc. Only hours before the Hasson arrest, Trump specified the New York Times as an "enemy of the people." NYT reporters already work under unceasing threat of violence.
Another of Hasson's targets was Senator Gillibrand, a candidate for president. Trump abused Gillibrand in gross sexual terms in December 2017. https://t.co/5o0VQeYEo7
High among those Hasson wanted to murder is Rep. Maxine Waters. President Trump threatened Waters with harm at the hands of his supporters back in June 2018. https://t.co/5Ef10q21HO
Hasson seems to have heard President Trump's call for "retribution." Almost every figure on Hasson's kill list had been singled out by President Trump for threat or abuse.
Only days before, President Trump had demanded "retribution" against those in the media who criticized him. https://t.co/FhaiA7NXct

Something else may be powering anti-vaccination fears. In the past, even reluctant parents ended up vaccinating because a trusted family physician insisted on it. The family physician is disappearing.		https://t.co/kGsR8F9Lq7 https://t.co/bwTEZmVCRJ
The question of why parents don't vaccinate has been carefully studied. Consensus is that religious concerns are being displaced by pseudo-scientific fear-mongering https://t.co/dg99D1SBTF https://t.co/TeRmIzCSeX
Because non-vaccination has historically been associated with religious faith, non-vaccination in US is hedged by remarkable legal protection. But as non-vaccination grows, the pronounced legal bias in favor of non-vaccinators looks increasingly obsolete.
And by statute, a state could over-ride the "no duty to act" doctrine - and impose civil liability on non-vaccinating parents. You give somebody the measles, you should pay their loss https://t.co/glNEeWxkZo

Boomers shifted rightward remarkably fast after 2008. Some numbers in this article I wrote in 2014 https://t.co/vHdhOuAtd9
Biggest boomer year was 1958, so yes, many. https://t.co/GVE8Auo9Ty

One more extract from April 2017, maybe the most timely  https://t.co/BLdjxJhAwL https://t.co/RTQXawLTQ5
... it REMAINS THE CASE that Donald Trump was seeking a giant payday from Vladimir Putin while running for president. That's the story. And it's central to the national security of the United States whether or not Trump tripped 18 US Code Sec 1622 along the way
SCO contradiction is embarrassing to BuzzFeed and somewhat embarrassing to everybody, me included, who commented "if true" on the BuzzFeed story. BUT ... BUT ... BUT ...
One of those lies about the Trump-Putin business relationship was told to Congress by Michael Cohen.  BuzzFeed reported that it had seen evidence that Trump personally counseled this lie. That report has now been disputed by the Special Counsel Office.
Through 2015-2016, Trump was seeking a giant payday from Putin at the exact same time he was running for president of the United States. Trump and his surrogates . repeatedly lied about this fact.
This Buzzfeed business is a perfect example of how the requirement of criminal law blind us to the truths we most need to absorb and deal with ... 1/x
This is the power of @YAppelbaum argument to open one central House hearing now - whether it's called "impeachment" or not - to shunt onto a siding the investigation of prosecutable crimes and accelerate the central question: what does Trump owe to Putin?

But he's certainly in line with how the most influential 21st century Americans think about the kind of country they want https://t.co/y9nYZzG1Ka
But in 21st century America, "artisanal" has become a compliment, rather than a term of derision. "Artisanal" is the exciting high-margin frontier of the US economy, not the obsolete backward edge
A long time ago, William Penn promoted his then-new colony as "the best poor man's country in the world." The poor man's country invented a new kind of economy based on scope and scale. https://t.co/KgsGegndlc
So it's probably true that poor(er) people create fewer jobs than they used to do. But that's less a statement about the inherent uselessness of poor(er) people than about other social trends and political decisions
It takes a lot of 17.99 Mr. Coffee percolators to deliver the margin earned on a $4,000 Miele built-in home espresso machine
But where Jerry Falwell Jr is correct is that over the past 25 years, the action in the US economy has shifted from the lower 90% to the top 1%. https://t.co/cXPX7kvzxr
And this tradition continues deep into recent times. What would Sam Walton think of the proposition that poor people lack spending power worthy of attention?
... unlike the artisan economies of continental Europe, the USA came to greatness as a mass production economy selling low-price goods to a vast continental market.
Think: Wrigley chewing gum; Duke cigarettes; S.S. Kresge five and dime; Henry Ford Model T; Samuel Goldwyn and 25 cent movie tickets ...
Through much of the past 150 years of US economic history, the great majority of the wealth/jobs created in the US were created precisely by the purchasing power of the (relatively) poor.
I propose to take seriously the below Jerry Falwell Jr. statement as proposition in economics rather than theology ... uh oh, I'm going multi-part here people ... 1/n https://t.co/W0PxoIwNSC

A quote from a Navy Lt in Military Times article https://t.co/pqZY0YKsnR
Anyway, don't let controversy over Trump signing souvenirs for a small number of carefully prescreened troops distract you from fact that the military as a whole disapproves of Trump's leadership very nearly as strongly as the rest of US society
In October 2017 poll, Trump scored best among Marines - a reaction in great part to that service's affection and respect for former SecDef Jim Mattis. Which suggests that Trump paid an approval price for forcing Mattis to resign in protest https://t.co/A8bZFNhg2M https://t.co/686k2LhQqY
Actual survey in Military Times, October 2017		Trump has 44% approval among military personnel		30% approval among officers 		Trump especially unpopular in Navy &amp; Air Force, two branches with most women - almost 50% DISapproval there		https://t.co/A8bZFNhg2M
43% of military men, 56% of military women belong to a racial or ethnic minority. Two-thirds are under 30. It's highly unlikely that "actual troops" support Trump in large numbers.

Why not tell the FBI, "I told the Russian ambassador that the incoming administration was reviewing Russia policy, and that I hoped his government would do nothing precipitate in advance of that review." 		Utterly legitimate-if that's the whole story. So why not tell the truth?
There was something about the Flynn-Kislyak conversations that was so radioactive that Flynn risked prison to conceal it. It wasn't Flynn's lobbying for Turkey that motivated Flynn's lie to FBI. If not that, what was the radioactive element worth risking prison to conceal?
So the Flynn sentencing leaves a question		Flynn lied to FBI to conceal dealings with Russia		Yet Flynn's own personal legal jeopardy arose from dealings with Turkey		So why lie about conversations with Russian ambassador?		Not to protect himself, evidently. So who - and why?

Last thing: Trump campaigned for president recycling literally the exact slogan of those who urged abandonment of UK and indeed all Europe to the Nazis in 1940-41, "America First." Now he imagines anybody will believe him when he promises always to be there for Europe?
The US has consistently opposed an EU army independent of NATO. The best insurance against a non-NATO EU force has always been the UK veto inside the EU. But of course Trump encouraged UK to exit on worst possible terms - casting away that veto
Last week Secretary of State Pompeo delivered an insulting anti-EU "America First" speech in Brussels. Today the president tweets that US can always be trusted. How I wish wish wish that the 2nd claim were true. Trump's election proves it is not.
Pretty amazing that the president can endorse street violence against the French state at 734 AM and then at 752 AM tweet that Europe can always rely on the United States for its defense.

9. But if you think of yourself as a pro-market, pro-enterprise person, you need to be clear-eyed about *what* failed should Macron fail. France will have lost its best hope in many years of emerging from a stagnation that has empowered extremists and authoritarians.
8. Macron may well ultimately fail. French liberalizing reformers have failed often enough since 1788. It’s almost a tradition there
7. One more thing: Macron does not pander. He's an exceptional man who does not pretend to be other than what he is. Not for him the fake-folksiness, the $2000-cowboy-boot anti-elitism that has been such a WSJ speciality for so long
6. Macron's intellect, integrity, and courage in office - his willingness to sacrifice short-term popularity for long-term sustainability (BOTH economic AND environmental sustainability) likewise contrasts sharply with the tawdry Trump presidency.
5. But I think there may be more to it than this. Macron arrived on the scene as an anti-Trump: an emphatically culturally modern free-market politician, whose very existence cast an ugly light on the bargains US conservatives had struck with Donald Trump
4. One answer is that for the WSJ - as for so much of the conservative world - DON'T-TAX-CARBON overwhelms all other issues, especially difficult and certain-to-be-initially unpopular pro-market reforms.
3. Macron has reduced France's wealth taxes, cut capital gains taxes, begun to reduce housing subsidies, slightly reduced payroll taxes, tinkered with the outer extremes of union negotiating power - not exactly Thatcherism, but the most market-oriented reforms in many years
2. What's very strange about the WSJ's editorial sympathy for the French rioters is that much of the anger against Macron derives from his pro-market, pro-enterprise agenda - an agenda you might expect the WSJ to support. Headline of a Reuters story from last October https://t.co/HhquDw3SHU

At a dinner last night, a guest marveled: why the fuss over this centenary? It's all "ancient history." As Faulkner said, "The past isn't dead. It isn't even past."
The anti-black pogroms in US cities bear an ugly family likeness to the terroristic violence launched by Freikorps units against Poles and Balts in the lands east of the Elbe to hold/claim them for Germany
The anti-black pogroms in US cities between 1919-21 bear an ugly resemblance to the attacks of Freikorps units on Poles and others in eastern Germany and the new Baltic republics
.... in Chicago, Detroit, and other cities - most horrifically Tulsa, Oklahoma - white Americans launched what can only be described as pogroms against black neighborhoods, determined to burn out the economic advantages African Americans had gained during the wartime boom
An anarchist terrorist wave killed dozens of Americans. A bomb intended for Attorney General Mitchell Palmer rattled windows across the street at the home of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. At the same time ...
11/11 ended the violence between armies on the western front - but not in the east and south. Russia would be ripped apart by Civil War, Greece battled post-Ottoman Turkey, Poland fought Russia. Internal violence bloodied Germany, Italy, Hungary, and ... be it not forgot, the US

If you want more on WW1 ... 		This is adapted from a BBC lecture on why the Allies had to win WW1 https://t.co/suEY4W5A0q 		Two pieces more specifically on US role https://t.co/OjnWw9Am5d	and why Americans so poorly remember it https://t.co/lNsuCsFGBY
None of this is surprising. Doesn't make it any less dismaying. 53,000 US combat deaths. 63,000 dead of disease. 320,000 wounded. These troops fought victoriously alongside allies with whom the US still stands today. It's worth a few miles in a limo, a few words from under a tarp
But bottom line: Trump willfully insisted on an unnecessary trip to France to mark the WW1 centenary -then once he got there shirked on grounds of weather the job of honoring those who fought and died in rain and mud 100 years ago https://t.co/7u3qZCmBRB https://t.co/5TX1WLt9k8
A truly appropriate ceremony would have united former combatants to speak of peace on the European continent - trickier project, since a considerable number of the ex-combatant states are now led by PMs it's probably best a US president not be photographed with
Remember, there was no need for this trip at all. The president could have laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington, then spoken a few appropriate words.
It's incredible that a president would travel to France for this significant anniversary - and then remain in his hotel room watching TV rather than pay in person his respects to the Americans who gave their lives in France for the victory gained 100 years ago tomorrow
Visiting the close-to-Paris monument is anyway already a climb-down from what any normally patriotic president would wish to do on the centenary of the 1918 Armistice: pay respects at the Meuse-Argonne cemetery, the large US military burying place in Europe.
On site, presidential advance could easily erect a tent to protect the dignitaries (and the the presidential hair-do) from inclement weather
It's not even 60 miles from central Paris to the monument. If the weather is too wet &amp; windy for helicopters, a presidential motorcade could drive the distance in an hour.

In last Congress, GOP held 5 of 12 New Jersey House seats. Next Congress: only 1 https://t.co/o1nNiOWqEA
1988 was the last year a Republican won a Senate seat in California. 2006 was the last year a Republican won a statewide office. Last year GOP still held 14 of 53 US House seats. Two are lost for sure, possibly more.
Texas 7 went Republican in 1966 thanks to dynamic young candidate, George HW Bush - a breakthrough in a state that had voted solid Democrat since Reconstruction. Texas 7 remained GOP though Watergate, Iraq War, and 2008 financial crisis. This year, it swung Democrat
Last year, Democrats held 13 of the 15 best educated congressional districts in US. On Tuesday, they upped their hold to 15 of 15. https://t.co/Vz6ZUUSzv7

In conclusion: https://t.co/y2f1ca6iUe
I won't extend this. I only ask: if you invoke the victims of Nazism - non-Jewish as well as Jewish - have enough respect to study a little what they were up against, before retrospectively scolding them for failing to defeat the most lethal state project in European history
But even a state of your own was no ultimate guarantee. The Czechs and Slovaks had a state. The Poles had a state. The French had a state - and a Maginot Line too.
Or maybe you mean: what was needed in 1932-33 was hundreds of thousands of Jews with guns - and not only guns, but also the full spectrum of military technology, under trained leadership, subject to political authority? Congratulations - you've just described Zionism!
Or were these Jewish middle class professionals one by one supposed to fetch their Mausers from the basement and battle the police and army like so many Herr Professor Cliven Bundys? How long would Cliven Bundy have lasted against the Gestapo &amp; Wehrmacht?
So how was this supposed to work for Germany's 430,000 Jews, mostly middle class property-owners and professionals? Were they supposed to organize their own mini-Haganah to battle in the streets in 1932? A battle that the Communists &amp; Socialists had already lost?
Confronted by State, police, and army, the armed militias of the Communists &amp; Social Democrats had no choice. (The non-Nazi conservative militia subordinated itself to the Nazis quite quickly.) https://t.co/4NDKF6TnXc
But guns did not stop the Nazis from taking power in January 1933, precisely because the Nazis took power legally - invited by elite insiders who counted on them to use the State to *suppress* the other armed militias, especially the Communists.
The non-Nazi Conservatives had a vastly bigger and more powerful private militia, the Steelhelmets, and so even did the law-abiding Social Democrats. Hundreds of people were killed in street battles in 1930-33: an NRA dream come true of armed citizens defending themselves!
You know what pre-1933 Germany did not lack? Heavily armed private militias, that's what it did not lack. The Communists had the Red Fighters Front: 130,000 men, many of them veterans, armed with pistols and clubs.
The people who argue "Jews fell victims because lack of guns" seldom clarify whether they are thinking of 1932-33, when the Nazis entered power, 1934-37, when they subordinated Jews, 1938 when the state greenlit pogroms, or post 1939, when the Germany army &amp; SS murdered millions
Sigh. Ok, I'll bite once again on this perpetually obtuse point about how the Jews of Germany could have saved themselves if only they had enough Mausers in their basements. Warning: this may turn into a thread.
