@PredsNHL As an Avs fan it‚Äôs the first time I have cheered for Rinne!  He is a fantastic goalie!  So good.
@Avalanche Not injured then?
@Avalanche Why is he not playing?
@Shapalicious Did most if the demo work prior to the auction. My company built the new venue. Had so many fun nights there in college. I have to say when we got work lights on in the basement it was nasty!  The old antiques so dirty throughout. Did get some cool signs for the man cave.

@dmac1043 I don‚Äôt think enough can be said about the Manning effect to get great players who want to come play here. Elway did get him though so credit there. I think getting FA players an easy sell with Manning, not so much these days. Players came to play with Manning not for Elway.

@hawksrule317 @VicLombardi To have a coach and QB on that level would be awesome!  We are so far off right now. He should be coach of the year if they go 10-6. Lost their starting RB in preseason also. Baldwin been injured all year. Great coach/QB combo.
@LloydLegalist First Gunp, Tin Cup, Kingpin, Old School
@purpledinocast Not homophobic from what I read, just disagrees with the lifestyle. Doesn‚Äôt seem like a view point where one would call him a dick?
@LoganH1421 Bailed out is a good take as we got outplayed overall. Good win!
@dmac1043 Still would like to see effort level of the Stars game each time at hone. Better tonight then Monday at home but overall felt like they got out worked. Great win though. Grub is our best goalie.
@Kevin_Lytle Do you think we lack talent on D or just bad coordination?  I was pretty excited to get a new D coordinator last year but results were very poor.
@HelbigKyle11 Welcome to #RamNation
@Kevin_Lytle Any real chance of landing Deon‚Äôs son?
@RadioMoser Why do the Avs always come out so flat against bad teams but flying against good teams. No energy like they had last game. Frustrating. They should bury this team early.
@Avalanche Everyone at hone also...amazing.
@Avalanche Why can‚Äôt I get the Avs logo behind my #?
@Avalanche Let‚Äôs roll!!  #GoAvsGo
@AllbrightNFL I think Broncos fans would have patience with a young QB learning the ropes but to have to deal with a young HC mistakes...so frustrating. At this point I say just ride it out. Otherwise last two seasons for nothing. Unless Harbaugh is available.

@purpledinocast Why can‚Äôt we resign this guy. He is filthy!!  Makes no sense.
@therealNFLguru Neither look like franchise players. My Broncos suck with Keenum so glad we didn‚Äôt overpay for a slight upgrade.
Keenum is barely an upgrade over last year. So hard to watch this team. I also still think VJ needs to go. Start fresh with a new QB OC DC. I would take a year or two of sucking if our QB had promise but not a year or two of sucking to see if our HC has promise.
Look at the faith Sea and Ind have based solely on QB play. D is inspired. Team believes. Tired of Den talking about QB situation. Let‚Äôs shoot the moon to get our guy. #AllIn
We need a QB the team believes in more than anything else. Glad we didn‚Äôt overpay for Cousins. Keenum inspires no one. At some point D tired of working hard. Von for 3 straight years. Get a young QB the base can get excited about. Dmac was right. @dmac1043

@PurpleRow kind of sad when you are just happy Desi doesn‚Äôt hit into a DP.
@Kevin_Lytle We have never really been good other the the Sonny years. That dude was a great coach and we ran him off. Building that big new stadium was a mistake and I know lots of friends that don‚Äôt go to games anymore as it used to be fun. Bobo reminds me of Fairchild. Not good.

@psaundersdp Such a big moment for Freeland!  Let‚Äôs go Rox!  Can‚Äôt wait.
@TheFFBallers Traded D Jackson for K Drake. Needed RB. Still have A Brown, M Thomas, T Hill, and W Fuller. Need to move another WR for a good RB.
We seriously have no other option?  He has been a liability and put so much pressure on out other starters to be great. They have been but OMG if we split first two games and roll him out I can‚Äôt watch.
@dmac @Rockies @psaundersdp Feels like we need to win with Gray tonight and Freeland tomorrow. I call Wednesday a loss. Two huge games that will define our whole season. My question is if they miss the division title, why continue to roll out Anderson.
@Kevin_Lytle Good to know. I think they should reverse that trend. I get tradition as an alumn but always hated the orange infusion into our usual look. Tradition!  Respect!!
@Kevin_Lytle My least favorite uni combo.  That orange/green...no thanks.  Will they be wearing their CO state flag unis this season?  Love those!
@psaundersdp Indeed!!
@TrevorJudge Our SB50 team wasn't built to win by a lot of points.  D was better then, I think our O is a little better now.

@psaundersdp I swear if we don‚Äôt win the division the thought to keep rolling out Anderson will be the biggest question. To start a road series with him is scary.
@roxchatter Another game we have to score a lot. Anderson...
@psaundersdp @DJLeMahieu Feels like another one where our pen gives up 1-2 and we lose by 1-2. We have had our chances with RISP and can‚Äôt quite get it done.
@psaundersdp Still a fan and praying we find a way to that title.
@psaundersdp Not that stat line that carries a team to a title. Plus our hitting with RISP esp with 2 outs has been so bad. We have runners on in all our losses and just can‚Äôt push them across the plate.

@dmac1043 I don‚Äôt like that he lowers himself in his tweets but at the same time so much hate from the media it‚Äôs mind boggling.
@dmac1043 He probably did after he was attacked!  She was suspended for two weeks. Another ESPN reporter recently called him a f‚Äôing idiot on TV. Why would he give them an interview. Hill called him a Nazi.
@dmac1043 Also, to say the protests don‚Äôt affect NFL ratings is ridiculous. Last year you hated Kap for taking a knee and this year you said would probably kneel during the anthem with the team. What changed besides the president?  Man has to have morals and stick with them.
@dmac1043 I think you need to look at the comments ESPN anchors have made about our sitting president esp Hill. Very disrespectful. To make it sound as though Trump went after her shows a bias or misunderstanding.

Joe Buck is a great baseball play by play guy. Very informative without being distractive. Good in FB also. Maybe best in the biz @dmac1043?
@BRKLYN48 @MikeKlis @AdamSchefter @RapSheet I so agree. Feel like we have no QB so play the rookie and chalk the season up to see what we have.
@ZaBlanc @dmac1043 Yeah, my point is get Verlander and how different do we look. I get it‚Äôs about pitching...&lt;yawn&gt;

@dmac1043 Understood. But we can add arms in FA and hopefully our young guys mature some. I guess my point was war are not that far away.

@VicLombardi Right!  Chatwood back to being a reliever. Ugh...
@1RickLewis @Broncos @Cowboys I thought Alfred Williams break down of how to beat them was great. Plus he predicted we would bury them. Smart NFL guy.
@chadbrown94 The presidents response I find really in poor taste but find the disrespect to the flag that has afforded people so much opportunity worse.
