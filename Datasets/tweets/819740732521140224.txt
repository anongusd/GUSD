@bluevol10 @GeorgePapa19 Wrong again. Keep making assumptions since you’ve already made an ass out of you 😆		It’s typical because of your willful ignorance as a member of the White Nationalist party 🙄
@bluevol10 @GeorgePapa19 You ask a lame ❓ b/c it’s obvious who I was directing this tweet to (not you) &amp; what I meant by it.		Perhaps you got low grades in reading comprehension, but that’s the majority of tRump’s mindless  zombielike cult members🤦🏻‍♂️		Try not to embarrass yourself when clapping back! 😂
@GeorgePapa19 You repeat yourself with this same garbage daily which is worthless as information b/c you give no details GPaps.		Stop boring us to death and say something ENTERTAINING or you may as well just retweet the same one every day.
@JacobAWohl This only proves what a tool &amp; lame ass you are if you’re out in someone else’s community trying to criticize immigrants by fabricating bull💩 instead of doing something productive w your own life.		It’s more evidence of your endless quest to prove you’re the 🤴🏻 of shitclowns💩🤡
@JacobAWohl Go read his history 😂		Maybe you identify with a cuckold like him though hahaha! He’s about to be the newest twink in cell block 4 (CB4)!
@JacobAWohl @ILCM_MN Lucky her! I wish it was me slamming the door in your face with that gross orange makeup around your lips 🤣		So is Laura Loser going to pretend to be Mueller’s long lost assaulted ex gf this time since last time it blew up in your face..? 🤡😂🤦🏻‍♂️🙄🤡🤣
@JoeBarri Personally I hate political parties, like GDub our first prez said we should not have. I feel strongly that each candidate should run on their own merits, flaws &amp; IDEAS instead of limping into only 2 categories to pick from. That said I’ll do anything to 🛑 tRump: Dem nom=🗳✅
@g_713sandy @BarackObama No that was your mom after I kicked her out to sleep in my doghouse 🤣		Such guts hiding your identity though! Obama’s turds are smarter than you sadly with insults like this. Learn better put downs as you learn English &amp; maybe you’ll hurt someone’s feelings someday 😂🙄🖕🏼🇷🇺 🤣

@BarackObama You’re the man! You should cruise by my house &amp; chill for a while- I’m not far from Duke campus! 🍻😃
@RepMarkMeadows @realDonaldTrump Hell yeah it’s suspicious, you know, like you guys were of HRC despite never finding evidence of any laws being broken. Except tRump is surrounded by convicted liars, crooks, and schemers who only use the govt to make $ for themselves, most of whom were in regular contact w 🇷🇺ns.
@AriFleischer If it was no big deal all along then why don’t you STFU about it? You’ve become quite the extremist, so far away from moderate you can’t identify with working class Americans anymore, whining like a cranky rich 👴🏻. tRump is corrupt &amp; you know he’s fucked, so enjoy the sinking 🚢!
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump You’re a jackass and obviously should slap yourself for saying each dumb thing you express. I’d pay to see that if I had a few hours to watch you set records.		Obama is enjoying Duke get their tails whooped in the first half not knowing or caring about worms like you 🤣
@ProudPatriot24 @JacobAWohl Yeah but you don’t realize how disparate those 2 have become or you’d know it’s absolutely ridiculous &amp; needs to be be switched back to the majority instead of one or 2 people. We need a maximum wage. 7 figures &amp; it’s payback time- capitalism thrives when more have more, not less
@ProudPatriot24 @JacobAWohl No, doubtful. This country didn’t get great by the rich not carrying us to the pinnacle of modernization along with them. Have you not seen the income ratio disparity between CEOs &amp; workers over the past 30 years or are you just guessing at stuff based on how you feel inside?
@JMessyCar @JacobAWohl Yeah right... otay Buckwheat! 🙄
@ProudPatriot24 @JacobAWohl Obviously the CEOs would have to EARN their raises or extra pay also. But they haven’t given back &amp; trickle down is a known failure.		They’ve gotten rich off of The People &amp; the balance must be &amp; shall be restored.		We need a modern day Teddy Roosevelt to bust up megacorps too.
@ProudPatriot24 @JacobAWohl Then no big payouts for these CEOs. Close those loopholes, because this nation didn’t become a super power by not paying for a better society like now.		We need to return our tax rate to when America was great- when we beat the Nazis after FDR brought us out of the Great Dprsn.

@JMessyCar @JacobAWohl Become a millionaire working at a utility company 🤣		Yeah... suuuure you can! If you’re the CEO with stock options and a big golden parachute check on the way out the door maybe!		Some people live in a fantasy world &amp; haven’t worked for a public utility company obviously 🤣
@JacobAWohl Yeah because public utility workers are known for being able to max out their IRAs 🤦🏻‍♂️		You obviously have no kids/wife/family to care for since you’ve been working for the power company..		The wealthy can help give more support to the nation that they’ve benefited from: fair=fair

@meckgop @NCGOP For a man who knowingly cheated?!?		I guess none of these people believe in democracy’s ‘one person one vote’ ideal it appears if they can support a man who cheated against a WAR VET who didn’t break the law in favor of this idiot with ridiculous hair &amp; a team of ballot thieves!
@NCGOP GTFO with this garbage! Your party knowingly CHEATED the People’s will &amp; Harris is disqualified as a NC candidate b/c he is forever TAINTED.		McCready won simply b/c he acted lawfully &amp; NCGOP got caught breaking the LAW! If we don’t get justice I’ll protest every day!

Of course- with tRump as his loyal submissive sidekick Putin is about to take all of Ukraine by force while our fake prez will say “we can’t stop all the bad things from happening..” as innocents are brought under the heel of 🇷🇺 oppressive kleptocracy.

@Reasons4Thought @ArchieWouldSay @simonamangiante No one cares though you see? Hillary was never President. Trump is president, which is far more important &amp; affects all Americans. Hillary doesn’t. Plus she’s never been indicted despite 20 years of failed weak right wing attempts, unlike Flynn, Cohen, Manafort, Gates, etc etc
@Reasons4Thought @simonamangiante Guess we’ll see. Either way trump is fucked though. And it’s not even January yet lol!

@StonKold @Mnkris10 @carissas2009 @carterwpage @joshscampbell @uscourts Well we will see what the truth is.

@StonKold @Mnkris10 @carissas2009 @carterwpage @joshscampbell @uscourts Yeah it's great that our allies have our back against these confederates, but no Mifsud info has been proven yet despite your claims.

@StonKold @Mnkris10 @carissas2009 @carterwpage @joshscampbell @uscourts You're just hoping, which is cute. But worthless in court.

@StonKold @Mnkris10 @carissas2009 @carterwpage @joshscampbell @uscourts We have no proof he's a billionaire actually.

@StonKold @Mnkris10 @carissas2009 @carterwpage @joshscampbell @uscourts No connection between Mifsud &amp; Mueller lmao! Where do you come up with this garbage conjecture from? Sounds like you've been hoodwinked because again there has been little info about Mifsud that's corroborated to be true. Just rumors. Not proven to the majority here by any means.
@StonKold @Mnkris10 @carissas2009 @carterwpage @joshscampbell @uscourts Um, no. Again, because YOU believe it doesn't mean jack in federal court (or any court for that matter.) If there was proof of any of that it would've been brought into a court of law, not Twitter court LOL.
@StonKold @Mnkris10 @carissas2009 @carterwpage @joshscampbell @uscourts @BuzzFeedNews They know he was lying and could still be lying about more + compromised &amp; massive leverage.  Which means they also have more campaign members compromised like Flynn- from the beginning.

@Mnkris10 @StonKold @carissas2009 @carterwpage @joshscampbell @uscourts Setup by their stupidity &amp; muellers got them no doubt, but you prob don’t believe in the law or don’t have legal knowledge &amp; say it’s all fake despite GUILTY pleas 😂
@Mnkris10 @StonKold @carissas2009 @carterwpage @joshscampbell @uscourts Russian contacts omg keep up. Everyone- Sessions, Flynn, Stone, Prince Jr, Kushner... less people haven’t had contacts w Russians than did in the campaign lol
@Mnkris10 @StonKold @carissas2009 @carterwpage @joshscampbell @uscourts Wrong. If debunked then send link w proof &amp; not some whack site that only conspiracy theory suckas value 😆
@Mnkris10 @StonKold @carissas2009 @carterwpage @joshscampbell @uscourts He didn’t even attend Veterans Day ceremony. Name one other president who has missed it to instead tweet all day from his hotel room so his fake hair doesn’t get wet! He’s a diva and he’s clueless about geography, science, law, &amp; being diplomatic whatsoever. He bashed war heroes!
@Mnkris10 @StonKold @carissas2009 @carterwpage @joshscampbell @uscourts Um, no. He gave us no better HC plan, period. No pre-existing conditions protections, despite Republican lies the week prior to getting their asses kicked out of Congress. Big big lies is all the man knows. Like a rich brat that was never told NO frankly. He’s weak &amp; lies 24/7.
@Mnkris10 @StonKold @carissas2009 @carterwpage @joshscampbell @uscourts We know that’s not true now &amp; he would get rid of sanctions so he could build Moscow tower w bribe for Putin of $50M penthouse. Read the news about this stuff so you are current. Otherwise you don’t have the ammo to discuss any of this.
@Mnkris10 @StonKold @carissas2009 @carterwpage @joshscampbell @uscourts Idgaf about Hillary. Why obsessed with a has-been? It’s like you think she’s relevant. He lied about knowledge of the hack of DNC emails. Lied about crafting Jr’s response to Congress &amp; on 🦊 about tower meeting. All he does is lie, come on 🤣
@Mnkris10 @StonKold @carissas2009 @carterwpage @joshscampbell @uscourts Lied to everyone saying no knowledge of payoffs to the women he barebacked while married. Claimed he never pretended to be other people on the phone w publications. Seriously I can keep going w his lies, but you can’t seem to figure out why EVERYONE lied about 🇷🇺? 🤦🏻‍♂️
@Mnkris10 @StonKold @carissas2009 @carterwpage @joshscampbell @uscourts Ok you’ve got no answer for why so many lies do you?
@Mnkris10 @StonKold @carissas2009 @carterwpage @joshscampbell @uscourts I’ve never had a deal in Russia is a lie. Claiming he’s the smartest &amp; has the best memory is another. Claiming better healthcare than ACA. Claiming Mexico will pay for wall. Saying no one loves military more. Saying Obama isn’t an American. How many more do you need? Answer my ?

@Mnkris10 @StonKold @carissas2009 @carterwpage @joshscampbell @uscourts Not a fact unless you actually think corporations are people 😂 Journalists risk their careers if they lie, unlike Congress. $ in politics should be banned for corps. $ limited to non-Dark $ and only to individuals with the max set lower than $2700. It’s more Congress than media
@Mnkris10 @StonKold @carissas2009 @carterwpage @joshscampbell @uscourts At least you admit 🦊 is a cancer, but not all media lie like they do.

@Mnkris10 @carissas2009 @carterwpage @joshscampbell @uscourts Voting ensures that all of the people are heard, except for the voter fraud republicans committed here in NC. Funny how they cry about voter fraud unless they’re the ones committing it. 🙄
@StonKold @Mnkris10 @carissas2009 @carterwpage @joshscampbell @uscourts There is no God first of all, and if the cities stopped subsidizing all that red you’d be screwed. So you’re welcome. We’ll drag you kicking &amp; screaming into the future though, don’t worry! 😉
@Mnkris10 @carissas2009 @carterwpage @joshscampbell @uscourts Washington didn’t believe in political parties, and maybe you should pay attention when you were in class and know the electoral college IS NOT the people. Wtf did you get prom king? It’s the ONLY office on earth not using popular vote b/c it’s rigged against The People, duh!
@StonKold @Mnkris10 @carissas2009 @carterwpage @joshscampbell @uscourts Yeah but that’s not being elected by the People as stated. Gotta stop lying- electoral college ain’t the fucking people 🤣		Big cities earn the $ and are the actual people, not some fake electoral college from hundreds of years ago which should be obsolete.
@Mnkris10 @carissas2009 @carterwpage @joshscampbell @uscourts You mean the Electoral College; he was not elected by The People.🙄 Lost popular vote by millions, so he wasn’t elected by most Americans.

@purplehead5 @Benjami31760769 @AYscrewdriver @GeorgePapa19 The Blue Wave at 40 seats &amp; taking the House back by storm means they have a lot more to offer than this fake crook in the WH.

@purplehead5 @Benjami31760769 @AYscrewdriver @GeorgePapa19 Appointments issue like what? Yeah, I wouldn't want a guy appointed like him to investigate me either lmao! Doesn't make it unfair since we're talking Nat Sec here involving Putin &amp; his ambition to ruin us to his advantage. GPaps is an admitted liar &amp; felon.
@Benjami31760769 @purplehead5 @AYscrewdriver @GeorgePapa19 Yes of course Whitaker hasn’t been confirmed which is why tRump put him there at the exact time he did. Mueller is def legal.
@purplehead5 @Benjami31760769 @AYscrewdriver @GeorgePapa19 That’s already been thrown out once b/c it is legal. Manafort, Flynn, Cohen, Van der Zwaan, Gates &amp; Corsi are singing so next will be Stone, hopefully Assange &amp; then the House gets to actually investigate after their sentencings. R’s just obstructed like bitches cuz they 😱 tRump
@purplehead5 @AYscrewdriver @GeorgePapa19 He got us through 9/11 &amp; was FBI Director for like 12 years, so he’s been confirmed multiple times = legal. Which means like before the judge will throw that out. By then GPaps will have been wearing pantyhose &amp; lipstick &amp; will have learned to roll over on command. Patriot? Nope!
White people are unjustifiably scared &amp; it makes me feel like their intelligence suffers, clearly. She should find another all-white country for using the phrase “wiped out.” 😡 https://t.co/vMRBHcNtt9
@purplehead5 @AYscrewdriver @GeorgePapa19 I didn’t say I’d punch him. We can’t believe him ever again though. Lies are for weak, greedy men. Not for those who love 🇺🇸. He knowingly did all this &amp; deserves jail.
@Benjami31760769 @purplehead5 @AYscrewdriver @GeorgePapa19 No special or independent counsel has been illegally appointed. If you fabricate stupidity again you’ll be blocked. That statement is simply laughable, ignorant &amp; asinine. Mueller was appointed by Rosenstein &amp; if it was illegal it would’ve been struck down in a matter of days 😂
@purplehead5 @AYscrewdriver @GeorgePapa19 Doubtful. He can wish in one hand &amp; spit in the other &amp; see which one fills up first. Criminals w/o patriotism who lie when foreign powers attack 🇺🇸 deserve longer than 2 weeks. At least no one will have him on a campaign or admin again. I hope I run into him in public someday 😆
@purplehead5 @AYscrewdriver @GeorgePapa19 Mueller wasn’t illegally appointed, period. GPaps should be ashamed but instead he’s going to jail for 14 days, not 12, &amp; hopefully he enjoys being a gf to whoever’s bunking w his lil beta self.

@purplehead5 @AYscrewdriver @GeorgePapa19 Found it: you should use google to research instead of just reading sites that provide your confirmation bias dude. Investigative journalist you are not 😂		You can also find his deleted tweet by searching “papadoupolous regret”: https://t.co/jc79VORzn7
@purplehead5 @AYscrewdriver @GeorgePapa19 You assume I’m lying before you assume he deleted it, yet you didn’t look at his Russian gf’s tweets obviously?  At least they didn’t delete their gofundme where they’re groveling for cash. Pleading guilty about being a liar to feds is a crime as is deleting his fb.
@purplehead5 @AYscrewdriver @GeorgePapa19 Wrong. He &amp; his wife retweet their pardon request often- you didn’t look at their pinned tweets apparently. And he did say his only regret was pleading guilty, so double wrong. W/ all the guilty pleas Mueller is already racking up these jokers very methodically. Corsi is next 😂

No man deserves to die for his opinions. Leaders need to be challenged &amp; the world needs to be purged from war 😞
@jjj2ggg @kbsalsaud Of course. He’s a bad leader just like lying Trump. He lets women drive, yet keeps the women who fought for their rights in jail still &amp; could execute them. Does nothing to help the poor in KSA. And he’s not elected by the people. My friends can’t go to hajj unless $$$. Not right
@jjj2ggg @kbsalsaud Most people in power are corrupt even in countries that have real elections. I speak out against US leaders who do not act with morality &amp; compassion for humanity. Here we do not butcher journalists or citizens for speaking out against those in power. That is wrong.
@jjj2ggg @kbsalsaud You know there aren’t rogue actors &amp; his stories are the weakest &amp; most obvious lies it’s ridiculous sir. He knew &amp; the tapes will get out. Then he will lie again. Perhaps he needs a child to help him so he could construct a more believable set of lies &amp; fake backstory. 🙄🤦🏻‍♂️
@jjj2ggg @kbsalsaud I voted Democrat so don’t blame me for Bush 43 sir. I was against that war and ALL wars, as I stand against injustice &amp; atrocities against the poor! &amp; don’t act like Saud wasn’t in favor of Iraq being bombed while they provided airfields &amp; fuel for US warplanes; fear of Saddam ✌🏻

@AaronPoloni @GeorgePapa19 Name calling is beneath us dude. Or are you a Russian...? Once a man pleaded guilty he admits guilt. Period. The judge even asks them in court if they’re of sound mind and not being intimidated or under the influence &amp; they said Yes your Honor, this is my choice. Just stop 🙄🤦🏻‍♂️
RT @NatashaBertrand: Can confirm https://t.co/YwyDDtEt2h
@AaronPoloni @GeorgePapa19 As usual you’re wrong just like all the Faux news- that’s not what’s happening. Anyone who has not committed a crime has nothing to worry about unless they go lying all over the place and if they lied then they’re hiding something. The end.
@GeorgePapa19 If the exculpatory evidence isn’t involving your charges of lying to the FBI or destruction of evidence (FAcebook) then they’re not required to disclose to your counsel. You pleaded GUILTY and with the whining you’re doing they should change your sentence to the MAX if you reneg.
@FutileResitance @ArchieWouldSay @GeorgePapa19 That is total 🗑 and actually spygste is the NFL conspiracy story way before it was this 💩🤣		Anyone who believes this isn’t too skilled at critical thinking. I’m done w u now trollmaster ✌🏻
@FutileResitance @ArchieWouldSay @GeorgePapa19 Judge me all you want but idc &amp; you’re the one who fell for propaganda from Putin. No system is ever perfect, just like people. But none have disgraced this country like trump has. He’s a loser propped up by 🦊 &amp; 🇷🇺 which is far bigger in scope than your DOJ witch hunt.😂
@ArchieWouldSay @GeorgePapa19 Nah not buying this garbage either. He plead effing guilty! Does that mean anything to you? Helloooo wake up in there and get it through your head NO ONE COERCED HIM 🤣 You’re not in reality there dude. Read more than fox and RT for a change plz. I’m done w you now. ✌🏻
@FutileResitance @ArchieWouldSay @GeorgePapa19 Rosensteins still there along w sessions still and who cares? Trump isn’t our 🤴 although his skin tone in the emoji would make you think otherwise 😂		You’ll never get only Trumpers in the DOJ or anywhere for that matter hahaha! You act like we don’t have laws &amp; it’s 1984 🙄
@FutileResitance @ArchieWouldSay @GeorgePapa19 Who cares who’s been fired? How many people have resigned or been criminally charged? That’s far more important that crimes have been committed 🤣
@ArchieWouldSay @FutileResitance @GeorgePapa19 Blah blah this is bunk. Trump is already on thin ice for obstruction and should’ve been charged already. Save your fodder for someone who isn’t the skeptic I am. And you can use my awesome name because I see through you so well. Enjoy the sentences &amp; indictments! More will be OTW
@FutileResistan2 @sandyknibb53 @GeorgePapa19 So what? The caravan doesn’t scare me either 😆

@ArchieWouldSay @GeorgePapa19 Omg 🙄 it’s not a perjury plea 🤦🏻‍♂️ It’s pleading guilty to making false statements to the FBI. Read the indictment on https://t.co/2CNLcwLPqe. If he had new evidence he’d have released it by now if it would get him out of jail, nor would he need a GoFundMe. Pleaded GUILTY: the end

@water_white22 @RT_com I supported Sanders originally, but R's are against groups of people and exclude many of my friends for their sexuality, gender identity, or b/c they are minorities, and I can't support that. 		Plus the pro-life stuff is just made up religious BS. Trump lies too much too 🙄
@KennedyChinazam @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump @jesus Currently he hasn't flexed his muscle to the Saudis and I think, like all US Presidents, they own him as well.		I'm tired of that and they need to be held accountable just as any other nation that engages in killing and/or disappearing Americans. MBS is unfit to lead.
@KennedyChinazam @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump @jesus Turkey has video and audio and had the Saudi Embassy in Istanbul wired, plus they're trying to figure out the story about him possibly recording his own audio on his Apple Watch.
@jaksroche24 @Rnewmanjr1 @RepMarkMeadows News flash: Congressmen and women don't know everything that's in any of the bills they pass.		I learned that from the Patriot Act, and it's not akin to any one party as both have done this constantly for years. I agree that needs to end.
@KennedyChinazam @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump @jesus No, the feds did NOT warn him, when they usually do, so the question is why would they break protocol and NOT tell him he was prob about to be assassinated...
@Rnewmanjr1 @jaksroche24 @RepMarkMeadows I'll talk about healthcare as I choose so don't give me your "don't talk to me about HC" line hahaha! I had my HC through the ACA and I have lupus. 		Now these assholes want to get rid of pre-existing conditions too. Watch whoever wants that to happen lose their race on Nov 6.
@Rnewmanjr1 @jaksroche24 @RepMarkMeadows It was getting worse only b/c the R's did nothing to help it and in fact tried their best to hurt it instead of having another alternative. Ideas win, not Governors who refused to take the Medicare $ for their states, and it killed many rural hospitals here in my state as well.
@KennedyChinazam @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump @jesus Yes, and usually the feds notify the suspected victim if they know about it in fact. If Trump knew and did nothing b/c Khashoggi was one of his many critics then he's complicit at the least. Also there is a story now that MBS got intelligence on his enemies from Kushner.
@Rnewmanjr1 @jaksroche24 @RepMarkMeadows And even Trump said w spend too much on military, so we could easily take care of our own by not buying 5 or 6 jets or 8 tanks, plus taxing huge corporations more since they never kick down any $ to their workers like they promise.
@Rnewmanjr1 @jaksroche24 @RepMarkMeadows So you ignored my questions on purpose obviously b/c you don't have any helpful answers. He promised to replace it with better &amp; cheaper remember?

@KennedyChinazam @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump @jesus I’m not the one who intercepted the Saudis communications about having Khashoggi kidnapped and renditioned there is why. I mean helLO!

@MrsJDubbMI @Free_Media_Hub @kimguilfoyle @DonaldJTrumpJr @JohnJamesMI @KidRock Yes she did steal it, or had it stolen rather. And to me HRC was the lesser of the 2.

@JulieValente @Free_Media_Hub @kimguilfoyle @DonaldJTrumpJr @JohnJamesMI @KidRock Wow you can fucking cuss at strangers online in the same sentence you talk about your side being civil w/ a wimp president who encourages Americans to attack fellow Americans. 		It’s irony at a base level, but it’s a hoot 😆 		HRC is done yet you whine like a baby. Fear owns you.
@RealJamesWoods There is no mass voter fraud. Lying about things doesn’t make them true, unless you’re a cult member apparently 🤦🏻‍♂️🙄
@Migey88 @SusanBa80858219 @FoxNewsInsider @JesseBWatters @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Do you follow current events at all? That has been well known for like a year now hahaha! 		And you know he can’t afford more trumps out there since each one is dumber than the last and costs him so much $ 😂 		Like he hasn’t had a vasectomy by now, but he’s impotent anyways 😆
@Shayna620 @FoxNewsInsider @JesseBWatters @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr You’re clueless obviously. Trump Jr will be in prison for defrauding their Foundation but you just keep thinking whatever silly lies you hear on Fox and Breitbart.		After Nov 6 it’s going to be a lot different hahaha
@Migey88 @SusanBa80858219 @FoxNewsInsider @JesseBWatters @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr You know trump doesn’t use condone on all the women he sleeps with right? 		Avenatti isn’t out cheating that we’re aware of, unlike trump who was cheating on his wife while Barron was 4 months old lol
@NSelkie @LynEpar @YaffaDina @mog7546 I think it’s hilarious alone, but the fact that the trumps act like tough guys was always equally hilarious. A tough ass kickin real estate developer that’s not even good at business w/o help from daddy or DeutscheBank (new daddy).		The best is it BOTHERS the Trump hive mind 🤣
@Migey88 @SusanBa80858219 @FoxNewsInsider @JesseBWatters @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr So you’re familiar with his cases or just shooting off nonsense &amp; conjecture? 		Are you in a position to know his clients? No. You sound like a wanna-be Trump with 3rd grade name calling and labels like creepy porn lawyer if you’re not calling out the barebacker-in-chief 🙄
@Migey88 @SusanBa80858219 @FoxNewsInsider @JesseBWatters @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Weekend at Bernie’s?!? WTH are you talking about? Do you not even know the names of any SC Justices? 🤦🏻‍♂️ 🤣
@Migey88 @SusanBa80858219 @FoxNewsInsider @JesseBWatters @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Kavanaugh just had the judicial complaints forwarded to the 10th Circuit court today and he's barely on the job a day, so Judge Judy doesn't have that problem where other judges she works with file complaints about her. But you believe anything Fox tells you no doubt hahaha
@Migey88 @SusanBa80858219 @FoxNewsInsider @JesseBWatters @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr So he's Presidential you mean then huh? 		The Trump guys talk sh__ but they can't back it up, but I never got fooled into thinking they were tough guys in the first place.		Pay attention and stop imagining Avenatti being your dirty boy for a moment and imagine Jr in prison
@SusanBa80858219 @Migey88 @FoxNewsInsider @JesseBWatters @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Story just broke about Flynn talking to Peter W Smith lol. These dudes are all ending up in jail. Richard Ojeda just got sentenced for helping the Russians.		It isn't nothing, but I'm sure you'll be saying it's nothing when he's in jail too. We're a country of laws right? https://t.co/jZvituW3j0
@SusanBa80858219 @Migey88 @FoxNewsInsider @JesseBWatters @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr 3 exclamation points, wow. 		Lying to Congress multiple times 	Which means he also lied to Mueller	He defrauded the Trump Foundation	Lied about Tower meeting	Multiple tweets were lies	Cheated on wife		Stone even thinks he will go down		Hard to keep count of his lies- like Daddy

@Shayna620 @FoxNewsInsider @JesseBWatters @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr If Jr doesn’t say yes now though he looks like a weakling and a coward to most people though, esp men. 		But what, now boys can’t be boys when the last couple weeks they could? Plus he’s younger than Avenatti &amp; now he’s not willing to go man to man despite being a whiny traitor?
@Migey88 @FoxNewsInsider @JesseBWatters @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Jr is a serial cheater just like his dad though (he’s got at least 5 things he’s not done fairly already) so I’d say his M.O. is quite documented in that arena.		Avenatti hasn’t cheated yet and has been on the $ repeatedly (ask Cohen) &amp; it would be on tv so we would see cheating
@FoxNewsInsider @JesseBWatters @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Nah Jr is too much of a wimp when he’s not having local Africans stalk his defenseless, unaware animals down on safari w/ a rifle bigger than he is to accept a duel for charity esp if the loser has to pay up. Jr ain’t gonna go get humiliated by an older guy on TV 😂
