@AnnCoulter The right is such a joke. Anyone that disagrees is immediately thrown out, even if they are a well respected General. You have always and will always been irrelevant. Your opinions garbage. Constantly spewing hatred and lies.
@fbichs2016 @1776Stonewall Regardless of if you agree with his decisions or not, he was and has always been well respected. It's hilarious to me that as soon as he puts in his resignation that "Republicans" bash him. Most loved him before. Just angry he told the truth.
@1776Stonewall He was spot on. His criticisms come from years of experience. He knew exactly what he was saying and he was exactly right.

@kathygriffin Still throwing a tantrum?
@Southernlad65 @CoreysDigs Never once said Christians worship anyone but God.
@Louis27314353 @nj_very @ColumbiaBugle Free speech, hate speech. That's the difference
@MikeStefan66 @CoreysDigs Yes the temple was. It was a place built for the exact purpose of worshipping God. I have a different opinion, understanding. Whatever you wish to call it
@DianeRosemond @CoreysDigs Politics are not interested in the church. Either side. As much as they pretend to be. Again, what's driving people away from the church is the lack of action.
@MikeStefan66 @CoreysDigs Just a little after it says "Whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anyone agaisnt anyone..."
@MikeStefan66 @CoreysDigs It's completely different. The United States government is not inherently a Christian body. There are plenty scattered throughout, but we have freedom of religion. If what she said included all government then what she said would be the same as his actions.
@Aaron8374 @ColumbiaBugle And you're still at it
@Aaron8374 @ColumbiaBugle Well it served no purpose. My opinion is my opinion regardless of yours, especially with your condescending one.
@CoreysDigs @MikeStefan66 Try reading the Bible every now and then if you are actually a Christian. Cleary you missed a few parts.
@Aaron8374 @ColumbiaBugle There was absolutely no name calling on my side üòÇ on your side however üëÄ
@CoreysDigs You have no clue what Christianity is otherwise you would have at least recognized some basic verses. Try again, please.
@MikeStefan66 @CoreysDigs Again your opinion. People have to have the faith in God for it to work. People are 100% involved.
@Aaron8374 @ColumbiaBugle Mad? There's no time to be mad, it's pretty worthless. Just like your comment.
@CoreysDigs @Toni848Toni Umm have you ever read the Bible? Because that's all I was stating.
@MikeStefan66 @CoreysDigs That's your opinion? Christianity is a real faith embodied by real people who walked the earth in the past and present. Christian Faith is the belief in God.
@CoreysDigs @MikeStefan66 That's actually your opinion. But since you're saying it, many politicians do a abuse their power. Definitely are paid way too much. It's self-centered because you're thinking only of your own wants. Pray for those who persecute you. Love your enemies.
@CoreysDigs You can pray however you please. It's just hypocritical to pray in public for the attention. That's all you're doing. Billy Graham would say that we should pray that they find forgiveness and help. Your prayer is self-centered with absolutely no thought of the other party.
@DianeRosemond @CoreysDigs Faith shouldn't be political. People walk away because it's easier to see what's wrong with the church than what good the church is doing.
@Aaron8374 @ColumbiaBugle He's banned for a reason, so nope.
@Toni848Toni @CoreysDigs Pray without ceasing, yes. Pray in secret, yes. Pray only because you'll get likes on Twitter and to pass judgment on someone, no.
@MikeStefan66 @CoreysDigs Doesn't rely on people? With people there is no church. The people are the church. Individually, we all need people to support us, but it's not a requirement. You honestly think God listens to prayers that are self-centered and judge?
@CoreysDigs People like you are absolutely responsible for people walking away. You claim Christianity like so many others, but don't follow it at all. You don't get to pray judgment on someone. Prayers don't work like that. I suggest you read up before you decide to pray again.
@nj_very @ColumbiaBugle Lol üòÇ yeah okay

@GloucesterLane @CoreysDigs @TrumpsterTrixie If you actually consider yourself a "person of faith" then I would take a long look in the mirror. What prayer would ever be full of attack and greed? This is nothing more than a show and an absolute shameful representation of actual people of faith
@CoreysDigs If you actually valued Christianity, than you would pray for him. Instead your "prayer" is greedy and attacking. The reason for people walking away from the faith? People like you who abuse it and use it for their own personal gain.

@RexNewby @CaliConsrvative @Biker_Bot1 @AwakeToday So how are the disrespecting anything or anyone?
@RexNewby @CaliConsrvative @Biker_Bot1 @AwakeToday Calling them thugs is no different then using "boy."
@Biker_Bot1 @RexNewby @CaliConsrvative @AwakeToday Not even close as much as you wish I was üòÇ

@RexNewby @CaliConsrvative @Biker_Bot1 @AwakeToday I mean thugs is really the term you want to use?
@RexNewby @CaliConsrvative @Biker_Bot1 @AwakeToday You're a dumbest who can't understand that calling them thugs is pretty racist
@RexNewby @CaliConsrvative @Biker_Bot1 @AwakeToday Ahh but he's an NFL thug right?
@RexNewby @AwakeToday @CaliConsrvative Talk like Trump more, it makes you sounds twice as stupid. It really does
@RexNewby @CaliConsrvative @AwakeToday Oh they are thugs now? Please. I won't talk with someone who actually thinks this
@cdblocher @AwakeToday @RexNewby @CaliConsrvative Nope definitely not the case
@cdblocher @AwakeToday @RexNewby @CaliConsrvative Then please think before you tell me to take a hike lol
@Biker_Bot1 @RexNewby @CaliConsrvative @AwakeToday What would convince you there's a problem then?
@Biker_Bot1 @RexNewby @CaliConsrvative @AwakeToday Clearly people still think about it though, made a big impact. And a lot more than just 16 times

@Biker_Bot1 @RexNewby @CaliConsrvative @AwakeToday Ahh so you fail to hear them talk about it and donate money to causes as well.
@Biker_Bot1 @RexNewby @CaliConsrvative @AwakeToday Yup, just curious which site. Though what I fail to see is how this is relevant? They are protesting the injustice in America, not just the injustice against black Americans.
@Biker_Bot1 @RexNewby @CaliConsrvative @AwakeToday Getting this stat from where exactly?
@RexNewby @AwakeToday @CaliConsrvative How many times to I have to say they are not protesting the flag. They are protesting the injustice and disrespect this country has
@cdblocher @AwakeToday @RexNewby @CaliConsrvative You're not a part of this conversation so you're telling me to take a hike based off my followers? Who cares how many I have? Didn't know that the amount of followers I have limits my free speech
@RexNewby @CaliConsrvative @AwakeToday Do you see them out on the field at halftime? Where‚Äôs the context of that conversation? I'm not just talking about one person, I'm talking about the rest of them.
@RexNewby @CaliConsrvative @AwakeToday Where‚Äôd you get that stat?
@CaliConsrvative @RexNewby @AwakeToday Hmm I was thinking the countless murders across are country that are simplified to just stats.
@RexNewby @AwakeToday @CaliConsrvative How are they being disrespectful? They aren‚Äôt burning the flag, they aren‚Äôt tearing it up. They aren‚Äôt even protesting the flag. They are protesting the injustice in this country so that the people without a voice can be heard
@RexNewby @CaliConsrvative @AwakeToday If you realized they weren‚Äôt protesting the flag, they are protesting injustice
@CaliConsrvative @RexNewby @AwakeToday For you to call them spoiled multimillionaires is absurd. Some are yes, but many donate to great causes and use the platform they have to do good work. They are fighting injustice as they see fit. Rosa and Ghandi are on different levels and deserve the utmost respect.
@RexNewby @AwakeToday @CaliConsrvative So Rosa Park was protesting the bus? Ghandi was protesting the food? Obviously not. So why is it so hard to see football players are protesting injustice?

She has thousands of pictures taken with her and there is very little chance she knows who they are or what they stand for?
@JackPosobiec Raise your hand if Trump still used a racist slur and that shouldn't be so easily dismissed
@1776Stonewall Your opinion is that he is disrespecting the flag, the people who fought and died for it, and the country itself... correct? What if I told you they sit and kneel because they use their podium for the oppressed and forgotten in this country who do not have a voice?
@IsraelUSAforevr So we make fun of other President's photographs but this is deemed "normal and okay" because he is somehow the "best president ever"?

@BeauCards @ScottluvsCuse @StephenMilIer @jkhsray It is too bad.
@ScottluvsCuse Yes it is actually, wake up to reality.
@ScottluvsCuse I was talking about Whoopi Goldbergs shirt. If your offended by Bill Maher... Which he is a terrible comedian... Then just don't watch him. Easy as that.
@ScottluvsCuse It's much different. As despicable as those jokes are. Calling someone with dark skin an "ape" is meant to be racist. There's no racism in calling a white person an "ape" or a monkey. Just stupidity.
@ScottluvsCuse You don't call someone with dark skin an "ape" and not mean for it to be racist. She did it based on the color of her skin. That's obvious.
@ScottluvsCuse @Zippityd00dah @ABCNetwork Was it though? Because I don't see proof of that anywhere. Much more proof of it being photoshopped. It's not a cop out, it's the truth.

@GovMikeHuckabee Another much more common theme is the many many words spoken and all the ideas about how to fix the problems. Where's the action though? Words require actions to back them up.
@romulusdefense @rentonMagaUK @KyleKashuv It's definitely one step closer to a possible solution. I think right now America is bleeding at its core and it's ignoring it. This action and all others before it provoked many words. Actions need to provoke words, but words should also lead to action. That's not happening.
@mcbyrne It certainly isn't "always" violence against women. It's not worth making this about anything else than what it was... A deep problem that America desperately needs to fix.

@iam_musikulture @latimes I‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs how it should be, it‚Äôs totally wrong that it is that way.
@iam_musikulture @latimes The moment you decide to make yourself a threat and are dealing with law enforcement you have to realize that any outcome is possible
@iam_musikulture @latimes I‚Äôm not afraid? The cops should be held to a standard of right. They were clearly wrong. Stuff like this happens all the time. People call in because they‚Äôre suspicious. Police react to the situation based on the information they‚Äôre giving. The caller was very wrong.
@iam_musikulture @latimes Doesn‚Äôt make me biased at all. I didn‚Äôt justify crime at all. Clearly murder is wrong and the easy way out is wrong. It all comes down to who‚Äôs the cop
@historBilia @georgeporge5 @latimes Which is exactly what I was implying. They didn‚Äôt defend the law correctly, agreed.
@historBilia @georgeporge5 @latimes Yes. Yes it is. But it‚Äôs incredibly important to just do what police tell you to do. And it‚Äôs also incredibly important that every member of that unit that fired on him be relived of duty. They clearly lacked training.
@georgeporge5 @historBilia @latimes I clearly said it was handled incorrectly by the police. I understand and I agree running doesn‚Äôt ever justify murder. That doesn‚Äôt change the fact that he should have listened and not run.
@historBilia @georgeporge5 @latimes He ran first. He didn‚Äôt comply at first. What happened after should never have happened. I‚Äôm not justifying his murder... police handled it totally incorrectly. But he should have never run.
@georgeporge5 @historBilia @latimes Police need to be better trained and better equipped. They‚Äôre fearful for their lives, and rightfully so; However, it doesn‚Äôt justify taking someone else‚Äôs. Fear should not ever be a reason to shoot someone. When there is clear and present danger, that‚Äôs when action must be taken
@historBilia @georgeporge5 @latimes What happened to Stephon Clark was a tradgey. Very poorly handled. He should still be alive. So should Diante Warber, even though he did pose a threat to police. Yes, the shooter that was just caught was armed. But it‚Äôs very possible he never posed a threat and followed orders.
@iam_musikulture @latimes The difference here is California vs. New Jersey. Could also be how police were trained. Obviously the link you shared was an example of officers showing restraint and good, quick thinking
@iam_musikulture @latimes Didn‚Äôt see the link, give a person the benefit of the doubt.
@georgeporge5 @historBilia @latimes They were wrong to fire as many times as they did. Perhaps even wrong to fire at all. However he did ram into police cruisers which was perceived as a threat. That‚Äôs justifiable. But no, overall it was wrong that he was shot and killed.
@georgeporge5 I don‚Äôt look at the color of anyone‚Äôs skin. I look at their actions. I consider what else has been happening in the area that might have caused officers to react this way. I understand not every cop is a good cop, but I also understand not every cop is bad cop.
@historBilia @georgeporge5 @latimes Because when they found him they decided he clearly posed no threat. They do their best to make sure they bring people in.

@DesertFoxMulder @beppe_fan @BasedMonitored I would have to disagree. Their is no need to use the word. I do realize that plenty of black Americans use this word, but I know plenty of them also do not appreciate the use of it. It‚Äôs an outdated word and it needs to stay in the past.
@DesertFoxMulder @beppe_fan @BasedMonitored It isn‚Äôt great, you‚Äôre correct. So you think it‚Äôs perfectly okay to call someone the N-word because you‚Äôre allowed to hate them under freedom of speech?
@DesertFoxMulder @beppe_fan @BasedMonitored Spelling error, it happens ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Putting them on sides, you would see it that way.

@DesertFoxMulder @beppe_fan @BasedMonitored Honestly, their are people that use those words without any offense to the other person. But times change, and as hard as it is to change it is still considered a hateful thing to say even if it isn‚Äôt meant.
@DesertFoxMulder @beppe_fan @BasedMonitored Hate speech is a written, verbal, or displayed message that incites violence against a race, gender, ethnicity, religion, etc.

@LMDB05 @BasedMonitored I don‚Äôt read the news 24/7, it doesn‚Äôt consume my life. Clearly I missed it.
@TriciaClick @TheDonald2028 But my point is... it‚Äôs not news. It‚Äôs picking at little, insignificant details
@LMDB05 @BasedMonitored What does Bill Clinton accusers have to do with Trump Accusers? Doesn‚Äôt it just further my ‚Äúnonsense‚Äù suggesting powerful people pay people off in hopes to keep them silent?
@LMDB05 @BasedMonitored True, but I also don‚Äôt just read one side of the news. I read a bunch of different articles on the issues from various sources.
@LMDB05 @BasedMonitored I realize this, but it‚Äôs important to realize that conservatives do as well... they use any means. Both sides have a lot of issues
@LMDB05 @BasedMonitored Why not? She was paid to keep silent. That seems reason enough to investigate deeper. Jessica Leeds, Kristin Anderson, Jill Harth, Cathy Heller, Temple McDowell, Karena Virginia, Bridget Sullivan, Tasha Dixon, Mindy McGillivray, Rachel Crooks...
@BuzzardSays @1776Stonewall You should really read some history. We don‚Äôt allow Americans to separate from Americans. Not at a state level. Both sides are very thick skulled and stand deep in their beliefs. Both sides need to learn how to respect each other and compromise. The left moreso than the right.
@LMDB05 @BasedMonitored I don‚Äôt claim to know everything, however it isn‚Äôt surprising
@LMDB05 @BasedMonitored Typically when one comes out they all do. It‚Äôs very possible to have a mix of fake and true, and I‚Äôm confident there is. But now that some, hopefully all, the fake accusers have been realized... the true accusers can continue with their stories.

@KyleKashuv I think people confuse that because we are also a representative democracy
@1776Stonewall Stop with this divisiveness. They can‚Äôt secede even if they wanted to. I realize they are very opinionated and on their own on a lot of issues. But the American way is not to shun those who disagree. It‚Äôs not to ridicule or call names. We are suppose to stand united.

@WKWaterfowlers @EWErickson Let me correct myself... mass shootings. Not a liberal by any stretch at all. I realize handguns are responsible for more deaths. But AR15s are more commonly used in mass shootings, granted they usually also have handguns in there arsenal
@WKWaterfowlers @EWErickson KKK still exists. Are they hurting anyone? Breaking any laws? I realize we gave freedom of speech and assembly. But that doesn‚Äôt mean that every instance is acceptable to every person. Groups like the KKK shouldn‚Äôt exist anymore, but they do because we have freedoms here
@WKWaterfowlers @PinkBelgium Yeah, no problem with the comment, I post knowing I could get one. But you‚Äôre saying my retweets somehow are my opinion? They‚Äôre not. My personal tweets are my own. My retweets don‚Äôt mean I agree.
@WKWaterfowlers @PinkBelgium No need to insult, wasn‚Äôt insulting you. I‚Äôm not perfect, I‚Äôm willing to admit mistakes, but I won‚Äôt listen to someone who can only attack and demean.
@WKWaterfowlers @PinkBelgium Well that‚Äôs sad, because they are Americans just like you...
@WKWaterfowlers @EWErickson It‚Äôs senseless to call for no violence and be holding an AR-15 when that‚Äôs the gun that‚Äôs being used most often in shootings
@NWInfidel @RealSaavedra Because age is a factor all people can grow into. Granted nowadays people can change their gender, but sex and race shouldn‚Äôt be discriminated against. It would help if these 18-21 range would get properly trained or at least taught respect of the weapon.
@WKWaterfowlers @PinkBelgium You came in here and said ‚Äúlet them drown in misery.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt ask you to comment, you chose to do so. The difference is that was your tweet.

@AnnieOakey222 @Theobeliskofkek @Cernovich I don‚Äôt know. He‚Äôs admitted to some wrong doing in the past. He‚Äôs had 3 wives. Doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs cheated, but it does mean he has marital problems.

@YoRosesYo @RUBB1SH_1 @TrumpStudents Yeah because 1 armed guard isn‚Äôt enough. And I don‚Äôt know his background, how he was trained, etc. He was never in contact with the shooter because he wasn‚Äôt anywhere close to him. Schools need to become more safe.

@YoRosesYo @RUBB1SH_1 @TrumpStudents 1 guard. The average response time by local law enforcement is 11 minutes. What are they suppose to do in that time?
@AnnieOakey222 @Joyful12 @Cernovich Because he was married to Melania. And now they‚Äôre in the WH. If this is true and the first time she knew about it that would have serious repercussions. Sure it‚Äôll be handled privately, but outcomes will be public

@crisp_aw @FoxNews @marcorubio You clearly hate the Dems to much to accept the fact the Republicans do stupid and terrible things to. Bad people don‚Äôt pick parties.
@crisp_aw @FoxNews @marcorubio Times have changed, meaning new restrictions have to be put into place. Chances are high we aren‚Äôt going back to back things were when you were a kid. So that leaves reform as the only option. It‚Äôs not taking away guns, it‚Äôs about controlling them.

@Jamie32377541 @t193931 @rentonMagaUK @lindseyvonn @POTUS Excuse me? You asked if I was high? Totally assuming. Boohoo an Olympian said she‚Äôs representing Americans and not the President.

@Jamie32377541 @t193931 @rentonMagaUK @lindseyvonn @POTUS You said she‚Äôs there to represent the best. Not every American can succeed. She tried her best after a terrible injury. She didn‚Äôt fail because of her comments. She failed because the competition was better this year.

@YoRosesYo @RUBB1SH_1 @TrumpStudents At the end of the day this country needs to remember how to respect people and be kind to one another. Tighten of the sale of guns. Have some way of responding to any shooting faster. And not live in fear of other Americans.

@YoRosesYo @RUBB1SH_1 @TrumpStudents Fair enough. What‚Äôs the UK doing differently? Not selling guns to kids, so most likely stricter gun laws. We do need stricter gun laws. We need to stop selling guns to people on psychotropics. But with the 2nd amendment guns aren‚Äôt going away.
@YoRosesYo @RUBB1SH_1 @TrumpStudents That‚Äôs simply a design flaw and an officer not paying attention. What is your solution to stopping school shootings?
@Jamie32377541 @t193931 @rentonMagaUK @lindseyvonn @POTUS As far as I can tell she wasn‚Äôt out of line. She is representing the people of the United States, and she doesn‚Äôt have to claim she represents Trump. Sounds like it wasn‚Äôt handled poorly. What was sad was the comments she received. Those comments did not warrant that response.
@awolf12 @Emily_Adydan @ITK_Peyton @Gaming24_7 @TrumpStudents I can agree we need to reform a lot of things. Mental illness should not always mean no guns. The real problem is giving guns to people taking psychotropic drugs. That should be an automatic no if looking to buy a gun.
@YoRosesYo @RUBB1SH_1 @TrumpStudents Then we need to train them to be able to handle these situations. It works in other countries. It can work here. It‚Äôs part of major reform that needs to happen. Pepper spray was the right choice. Guns should be the last resort. There are many other things a guard can do.
@Jamie32377541 @t193931 @rentonMagaUK @lindseyvonn @POTUS I‚Äôm not sure of exactly what she said. But if she did indeed not do it with some integrity and poise, that is a problem.

@YoRosesYo @RUBB1SH_1 @TrumpStudents That‚Äôs nothing wrong with the security guards and everything wrong with the shooters. The security guards aren‚Äôt responsible for the actions of the shooters. If security guards aren‚Äôt the answer, and I mean well trained ones that are on alert, then serious reforms need to happen
@YoRosesYo @RUBB1SH_1 @TrumpStudents I don‚Äôt own a single gun. Not a gun nut. Just care about the safety of our schools. How do we protect them?
@YoRosesYo @RUBB1SH_1 @TrumpStudents Okay. That‚Äôs a tragedy. It‚Äôs unfortunate but I bet because these armed guards were there the shooter decided against going farther. What‚Äôs it matter about the gun on the floor? It‚Äôs a school shooting incident. They‚Äôre not normally on the ground. Guns don‚Äôt get up and move.
@YoRosesYo @RUBB1SH_1 @TrumpStudents Guns in the school aren‚Äôt responsible for the school shootings.
@YoRosesYo @RUBB1SH_1 @TrumpStudents On trained security guards who know how to appropriately use them, it‚Äôs not evident to me. On teachers, that‚Äôs evident to me.
@YoRosesYo @RUBB1SH_1 @TrumpStudents I do actually want to understand. I‚Äôve said that several times now. It works in other countries so I see no reason why armed guards wouldn‚Äôt work here. I‚Äôve seen nothing to say they would have a negative impact.
@seth_marchel @drdepena @Cernovich That‚Äôs your opinion. You can take mine or leave it. I don‚Äôt really mind either way.
@awolf12 @Emily_Adydan @ITK_Peyton @Gaming24_7 @TrumpStudents But not all people who do this are mentally ill. A lot would show no signs of anything and still be able to buy a gun. It would clear up some. But a majority of guns are bought and sold through friends and family.
@YoRosesYo @RUBB1SH_1 @TrumpStudents It‚Äôs honestly sad that you come in and talk about stuff like this and then provide nothing to back it up. A lot of what you‚Äôre saying is just reacting to what I said. Proof helps people understand. Obviously I wouldn‚Äôt, since you haven‚Äôt provided anything.

@seth_marchel @Portia72307 @Cernovich I know people don‚Äôt care, but that doesn‚Äôt make it any less important. If it‚Äôs true, it would have lasting consequences.
@YoRosesYo @RUBB1SH_1 @TrumpStudents Give me proof an armed guard has used a gun in this way.
@YoRosesYo @RUBB1SH_1 @TrumpStudents Explain your reasoning then. I‚Äôm actually curious about your thoughts. As far as I heard they had 1, but okay 2. They never came into contact or were anywhere near the shooter. That means they weren‚Äôt able to cover enough of the school.
@YoRosesYo @RUBB1SH_1 @TrumpStudents Of course they wouldn‚Äôt use their guns or influence for anything but situations that require them
@YoRosesYo @RUBB1SH_1 @TrumpStudents They‚Äôre not a bad idea when they can prevent these things. Sure they‚Äôre costly. But what‚Äôs more important, money or lives?

@HJeppesen @coolguyluke4 Because that‚Äôs what they do...
@HJeppesen @coolguyluke4 I can agree that it needs to be better monitored and more strict. But we also need to arm places like schools so this can can be more easily avoided. It‚Äôs strict because it‚Äôs give to a trained individual who will be able to respond to the situation nearly immediately.
@HJeppesen @coolguyluke4 Very interesting and enlightening read. Not everything can prevent these tragedies, but taking away guns from legal gun holders increases the problem
@HJeppesen @coolguyluke4 So legal guns are taken away. We are defenseless against those with  illegal guns because illegal gun numbers are sure to rise.
@HJeppesen @coolguyluke4 So the real question when it comes to school shootings carried out by kids is how were they able to obtain a gun? What‚Äôs their mental state? What was their home life like? Etc. Guns may be the main menthod, but even without guns that doesn‚Äôt stop the person.
@HJeppesen @coolguyluke4 I think you‚Äôre missing what I‚Äôm saying. This guy could have easily walked in there with an illegal gun and done the same thing. Legality doesn‚Äôt matter. What needs to change is how we protect it schools instead of leaving them so vulnerable
@HJeppesen @coolguyluke4 https://t.co/LuMumbMdvx
@HJeppesen @coolguyluke4 Nope, just want to know who‚Äôs writing it and what they‚Äôre referencing.
@HJeppesen @coolguyluke4 Depends on who‚Äôs writing it and where the sources are coming from really.
@HJeppesen @coolguyluke4 If schools weren‚Äôt gun free zones this guy could have been down in a matter of minutes... please don‚Äôt use the victims and families as leverage for your opinion. It really is just a tragedy that could have been avoided.

@HJeppesen @coolguyluke4 Because schools are gun free zones so they don‚Äôt have them. Outside of schools it‚Äôs a much higher rate of civilians using guns to take down criminals I believe
@HJeppesen @coolguyluke4 Strike
@HJeppesen @coolguyluke4 They will always get guns. Illegal guns would be impossible to control or monitor.
@HJeppesen @coolguyluke4 You think there‚Äôs law and order today when we have school shootings, terrorists that could stoke anywhere, and situations that happen so fast that a person there could react in time but not law enforcement
@HJeppesen @coolguyluke4 Because military is trained. Civilians less so but still trained. One is world protection and defense. The other is defense and protection at home when law enforcement can‚Äôt.

@HJeppesen @coolguyluke4 They aren‚Äôt overblown. They exist. Maybe that‚Äôs not so obvious here. (Probably in Southern Cali or other high immigrant population areas.)
@HJeppesen @coolguyluke4 Hmm. Common uses include defense, protection, and hunting.
@HJeppesen @coolguyluke4 Pretty sure a barrier took him down that he crashed into and police took care of him. Wasn‚Äôt much anyone else could do.
@HJeppesen @coolguyluke4 The seem to be okay with illegal immigration though. So that also is an influx of a bunch of illegal things such as guns. Guns are one of the many methods that could be used and that have been used. People kill people.

@HJeppesen @coolguyluke4 Which one?
@HJeppesen @coolguyluke4 Because they have better safety procedures and people able to stop someone. Europe may not have a school shooting problem, but they have a terrorist problem.
@HJeppesen @coolguyluke4 From what I know they have citizens that are on watch and have guns and are ready to act. At least in Japan.
@HJeppesen @coolguyluke4 They have armed security guards
@HJeppesen @coolguyluke4 Still would be plenty of illegal access to guns. So how does it solve anything to take away legal acces to guns? It would be nearly impossible to punish illegal gun owners in time. They don‚Äôt just walk around showing them off.

@HJeppesen @coolguyluke4 What does gun control do? It doesn‚Äôt stop them from getting guns illegally. It doesn‚Äôt stop them from using any other method. It restricts those who are able to carry guns to defend themselves. But sure, we need to do better checks and not just allow anyone to have a gun.

@coIonistin @JamesMc30559324 @BasedMonitored @IWillRedPillYou Personally, no. At a country level yes.
@JamesMc30559324 @coIonistin @BasedMonitored @IWillRedPillYou I don‚Äôt see the problem in apologizing for the nuclear attacks. It was wrong and killed innocent civilians. Should we apologize for the war no, that method yes.
@coIonistin @JamesMc30559324 @BasedMonitored @IWillRedPillYou It‚Äôs part of your history. Obviously yes, current Germans are not. But it remains apart of your countries history. She should have phrased it differently. Also, I‚Äôm proud Germany as a country does so much to squash current day Naziism. America does not.
@coIonistin @JamesMc30559324 @BasedMonitored @IWillRedPillYou The country itself remains responsible. This is nothing more than admitting that in the countries history this happened. Nothing wrong with that.
@baconn22 @NewRightNetwork @TuckerCarlson @Rambobiggs @infowars @RealAlexJones @GrrrGraphics @afbranco So are you? What‚Äôs your argument here? It‚Äôs annoying that we focus so much on the past and seemingly can‚Äôt move forward.
@PaulDerengowski So focused on the past. I‚Äôd like to see you discuss anything that would help this country out in the future.
@PaulDerengowski Gotchya, well if you can‚Äôt think of anything more productive to talk about then move along and don‚Äôt be a troll.
@PaulDerengowski Anything that betters this country. Personal attacks? Evasions? Obfuscations? None of that happened unless you perceived it that way. This discussion about a past President‚Äôs portrait accomplishes nothing but insignificant talk.

@NewRightNetwork @TuckerCarlson @Rambobiggs @infowars @RealAlexJones @GrrrGraphics @afbranco Ahh good, still making fun of Obama. Do something productive.
@pseudosapian @BjENoren @BasedMonitored I don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs relevant to the conversation.
@pseudosapian @BjENoren @BasedMonitored It‚Äôs the guilt of their country. Again, it‚Äôs in response to Poland denying their role.
@pseudosapian @BjENoren @BasedMonitored And Germany is responsible for the Holocaust. They‚Äôre simply saying they can‚Äôt forget that like Poland is trying to do.
@presentdayguard @BasedMonitored @theSoftVader Don‚Äôt forget that there were also Muslims who helped their Jewish neighbors.
@sh7401 @hccnguyen @Halio1984 @BasedMonitored Yeah those policies will get her in trouble. She decided to hemp refugees, which isn‚Äôt all bad, they just need to return when their country isn‚Äôt at war anymore. Unfortunately many will stay, and the good always come with bad too.
It‚Äôs disgusting that you, an American, think that Germans shouldn‚Äôt accept responsibility. They respect their history, something we as Americans don‚Äôt do enough of. This is simply saying they acknowledge and accept their role in response to Poland saying they do not. https://t.co/ZJbh4aX8SM
@mickeyseeker6 @BasedMonitored Why is it okay to forget? Americans forget and look where it gets them.
@JamesMc30559324 @BasedMonitored @IWillRedPillYou It‚Äôs about accepting ones history. Nothin wrong with that. It‚Äôs in response to Poland trying to forget
@pseudosapian @BjENoren @BasedMonitored That‚Äôs not what he‚Äôs getting at. He‚Äôs getting at accepting ones country‚Äôs history. Something most Americans wouldn‚Äôt understand.
@hccnguyen @Halio1984 @BasedMonitored @sh7401 It‚Äôs not blame, it‚Äôs acceptance of their history.

@ThinkLogic0215 @BasedMonitored So you‚Äôre saying the killing of innocent civilians shouldn‚Äôt be condemned and apologized for? Especially the Holocaust.

@sgred06 @BasedMonitored @lord_haw Since when is it wrong to feel guilty about the holocaust? She‚Äôs replying to Poland‚Äôs attempt to say they were not involved.
@presentdayguard @BasedMonitored @theSoftVader Are you suggesting Muslims aided Hitler?
@SaCDav @BasedMonitored It‚Äôs about not forgetting. It‚Äôs in response to Poland saying that they were not involved
@FrankPayton13 @BasedMonitored @Trumperland What would you know anyway, she‚Äôs not your country‚Äôs leader?
@FrankPayton13 @BasedMonitored @Trumperland Nice assumption only because you don‚Äôt like her. But everything she said isn‚Äôt wrong.
@redcat0827 @BasedMonitored In fact some Muslims attempted and did save their Jewish neighbors from the Holocaust. Imagine that
@markpolitics4uk @BasedMonitored Because Poland is denying any involvement when many Polish back then did get involved. That‚Äôs the only other country mentioned.
@johnsut27124887 @BasedMonitored What‚Äôs wrong with taking responsibility for your history? Or should we all just forget it happened?
@Jaynewalkup1 @BasedMonitored Lots of Polish participated and conformed

@BasedMonitored He even claimed it was a joke. Way to make fun of world leaders. Makes you really really admirable.
@Susiefranklin1 @JayCostTWS What happened was horrible. What they did was horrible. Why was he over there and why did he steal propaganda though.
@VildyViix @PatriotLexi Fair enough. Could go either way at this point. Was purely thinking politics and not the phrase.
@DLHEWITT @RogueSNRadvisor @realDonaldTrump I don‚Äôt mind that he or she is hiding, it‚Äôs the info that they spread. People believe it. Is it true or false? They don‚Äôt ask themselves before believing it. They want it to be true.
@DLHEWITT @RogueSNRadvisor @realDonaldTrump That‚Äôs my choice. I‚Äôm not a so called WH staffer. I don‚Äôt have to have my real name. I know a lot of people who just don‚Äôt. There are good and bad people. The bad ones attack you for who you are. If they can‚Äôt do that, one less thing to worry about.
@VildyViix @PatriotLexi My main point still stands. If we have a parade and the millions of dollars spent on it does nothing but raise awareness for just a week and it all drops back... it was a nice thought, but veterans still need help and are living on the streets.
@Ledge85873047 @DBagChron @realDonaldTrump Ohh the accuracy. Same could be said for the 50 year olds ready to share the next conspiracy theory that involves the Democrats or any story (and I mean any) that makes Trump look good.

@QuockerWodging @maggieNYT That was his choice. It could have been handled much better. Acting like civil human beings instead of a mob would be a good start.
@QuockerWodging @maggieNYT Look, I cannot defend his past. If you can‚Äôt see the evidence against the Dems, and Clinton. That‚Äôs your choice. Is there a lot against Trump too? Yes. You choose to believe what you want to believe. Being labeled guilty when the truth is different ruins lives.

@SteveHutt2 @Buppy9999 @patmanspitbbq4 @ColumbiaBugle Well then he wouldn‚Äôt be giving the correct cake. That‚Äôs imposing his religion on someone else in the wrong way.
@Buppy9999 @SteveHutt2 @patmanspitbbq4 @ColumbiaBugle You get suspended on twitter for posting and reposting stupid stuff
@Buppy9999 @SteveHutt2 @patmanspitbbq4 @ColumbiaBugle I would bake a cake. Love the sinner not the sin. It‚Äôs not compromising my beliefs when I know firmly what they are.
@Buppy9999 @SteveHutt2 @patmanspitbbq4 @ColumbiaBugle I never said I wouldn‚Äôt go in, just not for ham. And cakes can‚Äôt be gay.
@Buppy9999 @SteveHutt2 @patmanspitbbq4 @ColumbiaBugle Baking a cake is comprising beliefs?
@Buppy9999 @SteveHutt2 @patmanspitbbq4 @ColumbiaBugle Meaning she just just claimed her religion instead of simply making the cake. Christians aren‚Äôt against gay people. They are against being gay. It‚Äôs sad that they could show the love of Christ, and yet choose not to.
@Buppy9999 @SteveHutt2 @patmanspitbbq4 @ColumbiaBugle I wouldn‚Äôt go into a Muslim bakery for ham. Obviously they don‚Äôt serve it. And if you think Twitter discriminates against conservatives then you‚Äôve just not followed enough conservatives.
@Buppy9999 @SteveHutt2 @patmanspitbbq4 @ColumbiaBugle Says in all the articles she did. Read up. The Colorado one is going to the Supreme Court.
@Buppy9999 @SteveHutt2 @patmanspitbbq4 @ColumbiaBugle She broke anti-discriminatory laws
@Buppy9999 @SteveHutt2 @patmanspitbbq4 @ColumbiaBugle Because she claimed religion without even thinking of doing anything else.
@Buppy9999 @SteveHutt2 @patmanspitbbq4 @ColumbiaBugle Yup but they chose that one because they liked their work and they respected what they did. They were disrespected because religious beliefs were chosen instead of showing the actual love of Christ.
@Buppy9999 @SteveHutt2 @patmanspitbbq4 @ColumbiaBugle Because they chose to intentionally discriminate instead of better handle the situation
@Buppy9999 @SteveHutt2 @patmanspitbbq4 @ColumbiaBugle At least show a little love for the other person. And can they discriminate based on race? No. Can they because they‚Äôre from another country? No.
@Buppy9999 @SteveHutt2 @patmanspitbbq4 @ColumbiaBugle Possibly not, but if they can accept people for who they are, yes.
@Buppy9999 @SteveHutt2 @patmanspitbbq4 @ColumbiaBugle Then they should be a good witness and show Christ through their actions. Their words were however coarse and discriminatory
@Buppy9999 @SteveHutt2 @patmanspitbbq4 @ColumbiaBugle That is dealing with the products they serve. This bakery didn‚Äôt claim they only serve cakes for straight people.
@Buppy9999 @SteveHutt2 @patmanspitbbq4 @ColumbiaBugle That‚Äôs different. That‚Äôs producing a certain kind of food based on culture. Many people enjoy it even if they aren‚Äôt apart of that culture.
@Buppy9999 @SteveHutt2 @patmanspitbbq4 @ColumbiaBugle They never claimed that they wouldn‚Äôt serve certain people only. It‚Äôs cake. Nearly everyone can be serviced by a place like that and not be discriminated against. They choose to discriminate.
@Buppy9999 @SteveHutt2 @patmanspitbbq4 @ColumbiaBugle That offers goods or services to the public.

@Nmi74245268 @RodStryker @TheJusticeDept Who actually cares?
@SteveHutt2 @patmanspitbbq4 @ColumbiaBugle See what? That Jesus didn‚Äôt accept others? That he didn‚Äôt talk to the sinners in their home? That he interacted with many sinners and walked a pure life? For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. None of us are better or worse sinners.
RT @NBCNews: Chief of Staff Kelly has not offered his resignation to the president, White House says - @NBCPolitics
@SteveHutt2 @patmanspitbbq4 @ColumbiaBugle Making a cake for someone who is that way doesn‚Äôt make them part of the sin. It allows the Christian to enter their lives and speak to them through their actions.
@SteveHutt2 @patmanspitbbq4 @ColumbiaBugle I do, actually. This wasn‚Äôt about condoning, it was about performing a public service. They didn‚Äôt have to condone. We are not suppose to shun those who sin. We are suppose to treat others how we wish to be treated.

@patmanspitbbq4 @JimmyMatho @ColumbiaBugle I can't go into the details of why they chose that one. I'm sure they just really liked the work of that baker. The baker decided to discriminate. Now the Gov't gets involved because of that.

@JimmyMatho @patmanspitbbq4 @ColumbiaBugle Referencing the women in the article... Or did you not read?
@JimmyMatho @Condor1941 @ColumbiaBugle Wow, now you‚Äôre full of yourself. Fantastic.
@JimmyMatho @Condor1941 @ColumbiaBugle Ahh back to irrelevant insults. Good for you. Glad Alex Jones taught you one thing.
@JimmyMatho @pennyguerrero @ColumbiaBugle Wake up then, Christianity is dying. It‚Äôs sad. Too much division and own interpretation.
@JimmyMatho @patmanspitbbq4 @ColumbiaBugle I did. She‚Äôs wrong. Judge is wrong. Plain and simple.
@JimmyMatho @Condor1941 @ColumbiaBugle Not a women, don‚Äôt know why you keep assuming that? Alex Jones is a radical, hate-spewing, so called news reporter who has many people wrapped up in what he believes. He has you trapped. Try being a free thinker. What happened to freedom?
@JimmyMatho @pennyguerrero @ColumbiaBugle That‚Äôs a poor interpretation. Guidelines, but still strict. The reason why Christianity is looked down upon is because it is so divided.
@JimmyMatho @patmanspitbbq4 @ColumbiaBugle Right. But if you open a bakery to the public and don‚Äôt mention you‚Äôre unable to do something then the consequences are on you.
@JimmyMatho @Condor1941 @ColumbiaBugle That‚Äôs what he would have you believe. He is no patriot. Just because he says it doesn‚Äôt make it true.
@JimmyMatho @pennyguerrero @ColumbiaBugle The Bible? Perhaps not ‚Äúrules‚Äù. But at the very least guidelines of how we should live. Examples of how we should be.
@JimmyMatho @patmanspitbbq4 @ColumbiaBugle It‚Äôs a public bakery. Do these same bakers refuse to bake cakes for those who lived together out of wedlock? Which sin is worse? Neither.
@JimmyMatho @Condor1941 @ColumbiaBugle I have, it‚Äôs vulgar, opinionated, and often times purposely spreading beliefs with the backing of someone who many think is a good person. Alex Jones is very far right.
@JimmyMatho @pennyguerrero @ColumbiaBugle Please list your source so I can understand what the issue was here. Never heard anything about it. I agree, all should be judged equally. But in this case, these Christians weren‚Äôt really following Christianity.
@JimmyMatho @patmanspitbbq4 @ColumbiaBugle Stating my opinion doesn‚Äôt make me a troll. Calling me a useless and petty insults is most definitely being a troll, or at the very least not being able to handle a casual conversation
@JimmyMatho @patmanspitbbq4 @ColumbiaBugle I‚Äôm not bad mouthing anyone. Just stating that it was a poor ruling that will be overturned. Discrimination of any kind doesn‚Äôt belong.

@PolarHogan @ColumbiaBugle Both sides need to realize that they can live side by side. Christian beliefs don‚Äôt discriminate, and neither should he LGBT community
@pennyguerrero @ColumbiaBugle But Christian beliefs are not about rejection. They are about loving those around you and treating others how you would want to be treated.

Not call out white supremacists? Escalate tensions North Korea moreso than they were in the last 8 years? Possibly cheat on his wife? Disrespected women through his comments?

Regardless of which side you are on, Trump is our President. The People are still in charge, let your voices be heard if you want change. That‚Äôs what America is all about. Don‚Äôt suppress your own freedom.
