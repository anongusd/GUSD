We can’t afford efforts to make gun violence prevention a partisan issue. Americans demand action to #EndGunViolence. We must make the Bipartisan Background Checks Act law. https://t.co/kNIfUHvFLh
More than 90% of Americans support universal background checks. I'm voting today to support #HR8, a bipartisan bill to #EndGunViolence and expand background checks.
Our current background check system has already stopped more than 3 million sales to convicted felons and other prohibited purchasers. Today, I am proud to stand with my colleagues in Congress to help save lives by passing universal background checks. #HR8
Americans are 25 times more likely to be killed by a gun than people in other developed countries. We can defend the 2nd Amendment and still find that unacceptable. #EndGunViolence
Today, Congress is taking bipartisan action to keep communities safe by passing #HR8. We must #EndGunViolence because one life lost to gun violence is one too many.

Gun violence costs each American taxpayer about $700 each year. For families who lose a loved one, the loss is immeasurable. We all pay some price by doing nothing. Today we will pass #HR8, a bill that will help save lives and help #EndGunViolence. https://t.co/3Dzcq0Q9cx https://t.co/MRflbITSTu

This will be the first National Heritage Area in the Pacific Northwest and will help our local communities protect and promote their shoreline treasures for generations to come. Read more on our bill: https://t.co/3UFB7wpDxx
The package includes the Maritime Washington National Heritage Area Act, a bill that I’ve been working on for years alongside my friend &amp; colleague @RepDerekKilmer. Our proposal designates a majority of Western WA's shoreline as a National Heritage Area.
Today, the House passed its biggest public lands package in decades. This package is a huge win for public lands nationwide—for one, it permanently reauthorizes the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF)—but it’s also a huge win for Washington state.
These questions all link back to developing a growing economy that expands the pie for everyone, and I’m committed to drilling down to shape economic policies that match our economic reality.
Since entering Congress, I’ve used my position to ask the relevant questions about our economy to both Democratic and Republican Administrations. When will America get a raise? When will more Americans be able to achieve homeownership?
I am extremely excited to nerd out about economic policy with @RepMaloney, @RepBeatty, @RepDonBeyer, @RepLoisFrankel &amp; @RepDavidTrone in our roles on @JECDems, along with the other Senators and House members (@JECRepublicans) that will serve on the Joint Economic Committee.

What are some of your priorities you hope to hear from President @realdonaldtrump tonight in the #SOTU? 		In our representative democracy, your voice is important.
We need to be prepared and committed to effectively combat Russian  aggression through strict #sanctions and with strong #cybersecurity operations and investments.
We also cannot make progress together if the President does not acknowledge the threat that Russia poses to Western democracies, including our own.
The #health of each and every American is also important to our country’s success. The President should provide a plan for how we can stabilize the health insurance marketplace and lower prescription drug costs, so that Americans of every age can afford good quality #healthcare.
The President would also be smart to address the state of our nation’s #infrastructure. If we want to end this cycle of slow economic growth, we have to provide forward-looking federal investments in our roads, ports, bridges, stormwater systems and utilities.
I've invited a guest from #WA10 to accompany me to the #SOTU His family includes a federal employee who was directly affected by the latest government shutdown. President Trump needs to remember these families when he makes decisions on bipartisan government funding bills.
First and foremost, I want the President to express his openness to a long-term bipartisan strategy to keep the federal government open. Our union cannot be strong when families are denied timely paychecks for a hard day’s work. #TrumpShutdown
Like many of you watching at home, I have certain priorities that I hope he mentions in his #SOTU remarks.

This shutdown has real, devastating consequences for federal employees (a good number of whom are veterans) who are either furloughed or working without pay. Federal employees in #WA10 are facing these consequences and sharing their #ShutdownStories with me.
Second, this shutdown is about a president trying to abuse the system to get his way on a policy difference. I am committed to crossing the aisle to keep the government open, but I do not want to condone this abuse of the process.
At the last minute, the White House changed its request to $5.7 billion for a border wall. The White House has still not submitted a comprehensive plan on how it intends to spend the $5.7 billion.
First, this shutdown is rooted in a disagreement about how to best provide border security. Ds &amp; Rs agreed to $1.6 bil in border security, which is the amount requested in the President's budget. It included investments in drug-detecting equipment &amp; more border security personnel

Rest In Peace, Mr. President.
Just yesterday I invited a freshman Republican from Texas into my office (he will be moving in there for our next Congress). In the spirit of our 41st President, I hope we can work together to build an economy and national security apparatus of which we can all be proud.
I had the privilege to meet President H. W. Bush. Despite our policy differences, he was a very gracious and kind person.
President George Herbert Walker Bush was our last combat veteran to serve in the highest office in the land. He was one of the finest members of the Greatest Generation, entering public service following a decorated career as a Navy pilot in World War II.
Helping ease the transition between military and civilian careers is one of my top priorities. Happy to report that the Army can now pay for soldiers to get professional credentials that directly correlate to their jobs. https://t.co/i3O511Fkeb

Some advice for @realDonaldTrump: 		If you claim to support family values, don't spearhead cruel immigration policies that break up families. 		If you claim to be fiscally responsible, don't concoct expensive immigration policies that do nothing to secure our borders.
Is it too much to ask that the Trump Administration think through their policies before they attempt to implement them? No one is well served by their slapdash approach to carrying out the law. No one.
There are ways to secure our borders without bankrupting American taxpayers. DHS have several other alternatives to detention and separation at their disposal. https://t.co/ylD80dnaaK
It's not acceptable for @realDonaldTrump to swap one bad policy for another, changing out family separation for family detention. This is not a long-term solution for immigrant families nor our immigration system.
Family detention hurts families and should not replace family separation. There are alternatives to family detentions that are effective, humane and cost a fraction compared to family detention.
The Trump administration is telling asylum-seeking families that they only have two options: family detention or family separation. This is a false choice.

According to @BLS_gov, union workers employed by state government in the U.S. earn on average 17 percent more than their non-union counterparts, and union workers employed by a local government in the U.S. earn 35 percent more than their non-union counterparts.
According to @equitablegrowth, from 1980 to 2014, wages for the bottom half of income earners grew by one percent, while wages for the top one percent of earners grew by 205 percent.
The Supreme Court’s ruling in Janus v. AFSCME will affect 17.3 million public employees, including public school teachers, firefighters, and police officers.
I continue to ask those in power, when does America get a raise? As housing, health care, and everyday costs of living skyrocket, we need to do all we can to empower workers and allow them the tools to earn fair pay and benefits.
In fact, we need to find ways we can attract more talent to replace a rapidly retiring public sector workforce.
When our courts make it harder for workers to advocate for fair working conditions, they hurt our public sector’s ability to attract talent. That will end up harming all of us.
This Supreme Court decision accepts the flawed position of special interests with deep pockets who are dedicated to destroying organized labor.
Unions will continue to defend the rights of teachers, police officers, firefighters, and all public sector workers who serve our communities with courage and bravery every day.
Our district is strong and prosperous because of the public servants who educate our children, put out fires, and patrol our streets.
I know because I was raised in a union family, and would not be where I am today without the unions of which my parents were proud members.
Throughout our history, the strong voice of unions has served as a critical part of growing our economy and middle class. #JANUSvsAFSCME

America needs to engage in the world, not withdraw &amp; undermine our credibility. #IranDeal
My full statement on the U.S. walking away from the #IranDeal https://t.co/GqU64uOc2X
*us not use in that first tweet. Not only does our violation of the agreement damage the credibility of the United States, but walking away will also make us less safe.
Congress should act immediately to express our disapproval for this reckless move. The path to global peace and prosperity is not through isolationism. #IranDeal
These are just some of the many dangers we now risk with no deal in place. This decision will create an increasingly unstable world. This Administration has let down our allies and put our safety in extreme jeopardy. #IranDeal
This move will also hurt the politically moderate movement in Iran, and empower the hardliners who are against working with the West. They will point to today as a reason never to trust the United States as a serious negotiator.  #IranDeal
Without this agreement, we have no way to stop Russia from returning it to Iran who could use it to develop nuclear warheads, or Russia could use their possession of it to force us to make concessions in other foreign policy matters. #IranDeal
For example, Russia has 25,000 lbs of low-enriched uranium they received from Iran as part of the JCPOA implementation. This ensured that Iran no longer had the resources to manufacture a nuclear weapon. #IranDeal
If this deal falls apart, the consequences will be numerous. #IranDeal
The Iran nuclear agreement has successfully blocked Iran from developing or obtaining nuclear weapons. Not only does our violation of the agreement damage the credibility of the United States, but walking away will also make use less safe. #IranDeal

Let's stay at this. We can make health care more affordable for everyone, regardless of their gender, age, employment or health status. #ProtectOurCare
Let's stabilize the health care marketplaces. We should continue the cost-sharing reductions to provide low-cost insurance plans and implement targeted reforms to improve the quality and delivery of care.
Let's allow Americans age 50-64 the option to buy into Medicare, so they can avoid steep premium increases that often occur at that stage.
As the Trump Administration continues its campaign to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, it’s more important now than ever before to fight for solutions that keep coverage comprehensive and make healthcare more accessible and affordable for hardworking Americans.
"...and, consequently, that drives up the cost for other folks in that market." - Former HHS Secretary Price.
"There are many, and I am one of them, who believes that that actually will harm the pool in the exchange market because you'll likely have individuals who are younger and healthier not participating in that market..." - Former HHS Secretary Price
Even President Trump's former HHS Secretary Tom Price admitted it: https://t.co/bG5yGLRTnj
For example, the #GOPTaxScam will drive up health premiums for American families due to the elimination of the individual mandate.
I am pleased that this terrible bill died in the Senate, but I believe we are still far from the finish line on this issue.
Today marks one year since I joined 212 of my colleagues in opposing the disastrous Republican healthcare bill that would have made coverage unaffordable and infeasible for sicker and low-income Washingtonians.
Don't get me wrong - a low unemployment rate &amp; a lower U6 rate is great. But when do Americans get a raise? A thriving economy should lift all hard-working people. #BetterWages #ABetterDeal https://t.co/x6BJi3YzNQ

More economic sanctions against the key oligarchs can help curtail this effort to attack our democracy.  Squeezing their wallets puts the squeeze on Putin.
People are being killed. President Trump should focus his ire on Putin, and apply more economic pressure to this oppressive regime which continues to threaten the U.S. and our allies.
Sanctioning the Russian oligarchs who are connected to organize crime  and help finance these criminal acts on Putin’s behalf is becoming increasingly urgent.
This is really only step one of many necessary steps to demonstrate that we are serious about their movements to attack Western democracies.

I would urge my colleagues to reject H.R. 5711, which undermines the foundation of our national and economic security.
We continue to have numerous differences w/ Iran, but I sleep better at night knowing @TheIranDeal stops them from obtaining a nuclear bomb
Even if we ignore the facts that this bill will make us less safe, this bill fails spectacularly at preventing Iran from buying airplanes.
If we get rid of @TheIranDeal, do my colleagues really think we could ever go back &amp; say w/ a straight face: “let’s start over?”
What is our plan B if Congress provokes the collapse of @TheIranDeal?
Let's be clear: Prohibiting U.S.-made aircraft sales to Iran will make us LESS SAFE &amp; would violate our end of the bargain w/ @TheIranDeal
