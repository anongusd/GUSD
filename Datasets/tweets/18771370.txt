@johnnydollar01 Was it the news side or the opinion side of Fox News that pushed the Seth Rich conspiracy theory? Or was it both?

How Fox News merged with Capitol Hill at the Michael Cohen hearing: https://t.co/GhSOk8Qccw
But the steady refusal to reckon with the presidential misconduct at issue and the insistence on steering the conversation to the flaws of the critic: It was like an extended version of "Tucker Carlson Tonight."
And for sure, there's a lot there: Cohen is a hypocrite, a liar and so on.
Another thing: The day's committee proceedings felt like a night on Fox News's prime time, in that you had a panel of people leveling ad hominem attacks against a Trump critic.

In any case, a question: If BuzzFeed had reported in January that Cohen was merely under the general impression that his role was to comply with and repeat Trump's lies, would anyone have cared?
So a good question for some lawmaker would be to ask Cohen if, as BuzzFeed reported, he told the special counsel that the president "personally instructed" him to lie.
To "instruct" is to "direct or command someone to do something, especially as an official order." That's something more specific than this general understanding that Cohen wouldn't contradict the president's lies.
So Trump told Cohen indirectly to lie. Yet the BuzzFeed story said that Cohen had told the special counsel that "the president personally instructed him to lie."
In his statement, Cohen said: "Mr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That's not how he operates." But then he said that Trump had a way to request compliance with his mendacity: https://t.co/dbB3X7ZH2K
There's a fascinating debate afoot over whether Michael Cohen's pre-hearing statement substantiates or detracts from the controversial January BuzzFeed story that Trump "directed" him to lie: https://t.co/FHpx6b0JkE

@joshtpm Well, BuzzFeed headline says that Trump "directed" Cohen to lie to Congress. Not sure that there's much daylight between that and to "pressure."
Now, the cable-news position is undoubtedly that, well, everyone was talking about it, so we covered it. But that's a tautological proposition: Everyone was talking about it in large part because cable news was programming it. 7/
I am not saying that the BuzzFeed report is definitively wrong -- merely that if the cable news networks can't confirm something, is it too much to ask that they spend the day chatting about stories that they CAN confirm? 6/
Cable news, though, remains a significant problem. I watched mostly CNN and MSNBC today, and even though both declared that they couldn't independently confirm the BuzzFeed reporting, they filled their airwaves with chatter about the story. 5/

Nothing is lost if they merely monitor the speech for news. If it turns out that there is news, they can break in and report it. If there is only lying and distorting, they can carry on with their regularly scheduled activities. 3/

@TuckerCarlson @TPUSA Something very distinct and powerful happens to that voice when he gets behind the desk at Fox News.
@TuckerCarlson @TPUSA I recommend the session, even on a holiday weekend, very entertaining: https://t.co/zrAVtEYNyC And I will say this: When Carlson is speaking to non-Fox News audiences, he is at his best -- for example, when he was one of the guiding narrators on the Netflix Roger Stone doc.
@TuckerCarlson @TPUSA He and Charlie Kirk clashed several times over the role of the state, and Carlson quite frankly blew Kirk away with his nimble comebacks and anecdotes, quips, etc.
@TuckerCarlson @TPUSA A highlight came when @TuckerCarlson spoke disapprovingly of his past life as a libertarian and warned about pot legalization, averring that the governing class will have a docile, high population if everyone's smoking it.
I've been enjoying the chat of @TuckerCarlson at @tpusa #sas2018 with Charlie Kirk. The two have plowed through topics including government regulation, prosperity, foreign policy, shutdown and more.
@armandodkos Fair objection!
Furthermore, he said that Carlson was merely being "thoughtless" in describing immigration this way. "I don’t think Tucker’s a bigot," said Dershowitz. Note: Carlson has used similar language before, so he's been "thoughtless" on more than one occasion.
In our brief chat, Dershowitz repeated his conviction that Carlson shouldn't have used the word "dirtier" in connection with immigrants. "That’s a code word and I wish he would have explained that trash collectors don’t pick up the trash in immigrant neighborhoods," he said.
He said that there was no coordination with Carlson or his show. "I didn’t tell him in advance because I just wanted it to come straight from the heart and he handled it very well," said Dershowitz. 2/

@MichaelSocolow @DFHobbs @jackshafer @mathewi The cable bundle makes this particular form of action cumbersome and, if you like other channels, contrary to self interest.
@MichaelSocolow @mathewi @jackshafer Well, one appears to be top-down and the other is bottom-up, and that would seem to me to be a big distinction. No?
Tucker Carlson appears determined to feed the advertiser-pressure campaign against him: https://t.co/jpvsPkaq9a
@MichaelSocolow @mathewi @jackshafer But ownership is a consideration separate from advertiser pressure campaigns.
@MichaelSocolow @mathewi @jackshafer Well, we're really screwed, then, considering the current ownership of major TV news outlets.
@jackshafer @mathewi As I argued today, Fox News has given Carlson carte blanche editorial discretion -- no editing whatsoever, to hear him tell it. This failure has left a vacuum that others are now filling. https://t.co/C8dlPtlhuh
@jackshafer @mathewi ...calling on advertisers to reevaluate their relationship with Fox News is one heck of an effective way to get the attention of Fox News. Other methods, not quite as much. https://t.co/dXlIqccv9Q
@jackshafer @mathewi And so people turn to whatever forms of feedback prove most effective at effecting change -- since Fox News ignored two years of complaints about "Tucker Carlson Tonight." And to judge from the vehemence of recent Fox News statements....
@jackshafer @mathewi Not only that, but Fox, I'm convinced, has built its audienceby rejecting demands that it respect such norms. Its fans seem to adore the middle finger that it thrusts toward folks who demand that its hosts, for example, refrain from saying immigration makes USA "dirtier."
@jackshafer While I've never been a cheerleader of these particular advertiser pressure campaigns, I have concluded that it doesn't matter what I or @jackshafer or @mathewi thinks about them. They happen because an institution -- Fox News -- refuses to acknowledge norms of decency.
@jackshafer Agreed -- that's a scary prospect. But I have to ask: If it is such a threat, why hasn't this doomsday already played out? Fox News, after all, has been around for two decades plus. The other cable news nets have been in their respective places for years.

@jsolomonReports Your source said at the hearing that you shared the docs with Republicans and Norton said Dems didn’t get them until after Rs got them. How to square that testimony with your answer?
@jsolomonReports What was there to authenticate? You got documents from financial investigators/whistleblowers. It's their work, presumably signed by them. The question is why you passed along 1,300 pages of this stuff exclusively to House Republicans. That is the question.
@jsolomonReports Thanks for the response, John. The complaint, as articulated at the hearing, is that you gave 1,300 pages of material to Republicans but not to Democrats, and that your source didn't know you'd be doing that. Any response to that?
So how did Republicans on the committee get the documents? "Those materials, we later learned, were supplied to the Republican side by John Solomon," said Moynihan, referring to The Hill's opinion contributor who's been on the Clinton Foundation beat for years.
Norton then asked one of the men -- John Moynihan -- if they'd provided the documents to the Republicans. Moynihan responded that he hadn't.
The private sleuths sent a set of findings to the IRS about the Clinton Foundation, and Norton wanted to know why these folks hadn't shared their documents with Democratic staff, but Republicans did get access to them -- 1,300 pages.
In a House oversight committee hearing this afternoon, D.C.'s Eleanor Holmes Norton quizzed a pair of "financial investigators" who'd amassed a bunch of unflattering "indicia" about the Clinton Foundation.

@zpleat She didn't
Is she moving on soon? "Not that I know about," said @PressSec. "I take it one day at a time." Says she'd like to continue doing what she does.
"I hope that, at times, we've brought a little humor into the process," says @PressSec
What does @PressSec hope her legacy will be? She responds that she wants to be remembered as being "transparent and honest" in her role.
Is there still a role for the press briefing, asks Johnson of @presssec? Sanders responds by talking about all the gaggles and pool sprays that the president does. "Amount of access that this WH has given to the press is unprecedented."
On scaling back WH press briefing: @presssec saying there are a lot of ways to communicate that didn't exist before, also says it's ideal to have president himself speaking to the press.
And now @presssec concluding answer by saying it's a good idea to bring the "temperature down," "but I think both sides have a role to play in that process."
Pressed further on this matter by Johnson, @presssec is now talking about Trump being a fighter and so on and so forth.
Johnson, on a roll, is asking whether she views Trump's attacks on men AND women reporters as appropriate. Sanders responds that she doesn't always view the media's conduct as appropriate.
Johnson asks about how @potus trashes women, @presssec says there's been an "equal number of contentious conversations with your male colleagues."
"Lots of coffee and a little wine in the evenings," says @presssec when asked how she copes with endless heap of work.
Asked for more detail on newsletters, @PressSec gives general answer on importance of straight news stripped of bias.
Asked what she reads in the morning, @PressSec  says, 'a lot of email....I read all of the news of the day," including newsletters, some Twitter and packets of paperwork from her children's school.
"You're always going to have people that disagree with you no matter what you do" -- @PressSec
Johnson asks about Sanders own approach to the job of @PressSec: Can women have it all? Sanders says yes, "I have three incredible kids...I think it's important for me personally" that her daughter can see she can have a great career.
Johnson mentions new A&amp;E documentary about Clinton admin. and toll of Lewinsky probe on staff. What is toll on WH of Mueller? @PressSec deflects to talk about the "personal toll on the country."
That said, @PressSec says WH is looking for a new COS who "believes in what we are doing."
On new chief-of-staff search, @PressSec  says she thinks Trump has had a good relationship with John Kelly, a "great American." "He brought a lot of structure to the White House."
Will it be fair to call it a "Trump shutdown," asks Johnson. @PressSec responds that they're not hung up on "labels."
It's "important for them to have those types of meetings," says @presssec in ref to today's meeting, adds it's impt to have "that type of transparency."
Asked about today's session with Pelosi and Schumer, @PressSec says it was "productive." She talks about bipartisan efforts on criminal justice reform. Also: Farm bill. "looks like we're going to get something done on that."

Per White House letter to Acosta on Nov. 19, here are the new rules for press conferences at the White House. https://t.co/a6C2pmLv2K
@brianstelter @Acosta Businesses often tell their congressional reps and Cabinet officials that what they need most is a stable regulatory environment. This is the exact opposite.
@brianstelter @Acosta To sum up: WH revoked pass; doubled down on revocation after CNN sued; tripled down after judge ruled in favor of CNN TRO request; and now appears to have bailed on the whole thing, with the condition that people comply with new press-conference rules.
@brianstelter @Acosta And THAT letter, in turn, came after a judge in the CNN v. White House case issued a TRO restoring temporarily the @Acosta hard pass after it was suspended on Nov. 7. White House hadn't given Acosta due process, the court found.
@brianstelter @Acosta This development comes after this same White House, on Friday night, sent a letter outlining a "preliminary decision" yanking those credentials and inviting @acosta to appeal.

@brianstelter @Acosta @PressSec That's a tough argument to make, considering how many other reporters in the briefing room have tussled with @presssec and Trump.
@brianstelter @Acosta On its face, absolutely true! So why have Trump and @PressSec and the rest of them turned on CNN with such vehemence, if indeed everyone else poses equally tough questions? Is it really because @acosta is rude, or something?
@brianstelter @Acosta Justice Department attorney James Burnham scoffed at the idea that the White House had discriminated against Acosta by noting that many other journalists had pressed the president on Acosta's topics in that same Nov. 7 press conference. Here's what he told Judge Kelly: https://t.co/PlrqP8RK0w
@brianstelter @Acosta CNN's lawyers argue in their complaint that the revocation was indeed an example of viewpoint discrimination, which is a First Amendment no-no. In an oral argument on Wednesday, the government disputed any such claim.
@brianstelter @Acosta If the litigation does proceed, it will likely address the key question of whether the revocation constituted viewpoint discrimination against @acosta and CNN, and that's an interesting question.
In a CNN appearance, @brianstelter talked about the possibility that the @acosta v. White House case could just go away. Pursuant to Judge Kelly's ruling today, he has his press pass back. White House could just quietly slink away, and attack some other outlet for a while.
Remember when Trump called @Acosta a rude and bad person last week? The government actually argued that this outburst constituted an element of "due process": https://t.co/mFZvflioSN
This is your government on Trump: https://t.co/ISW3tMBUFG
Here's what Trump-appointed Judge Kelly said about gov't case: "Whatever process occurred within the government is still so shrouded in mystery that the government could not tell me at oral argument who made the initial decision to revoke Mr. Acosta's press pass."
Another important point from the federal court hearing today: Not only is the Trump White House out of control, it's incompetent.
So: Slam Dunk for CNN
Judge just ruled in favor of @Acosta: Cnn TRO is granted and press pass must be restored
Judge: fact that cnn has other pass holders does NOT make the “harm to @Acosta any less irreparable” (yay)
Judge moving now to q of “irreparable harm” to @Acosta from credential denial.
Judge now saying that the whole thing about @Acosta “placing hands” on intern was of “questionable accuracy”
Judge criticizes government’s defense of its procedures in revoking @Acosta press pass.
Judge says that CNN has demonstrated a likelihood of success that it will prevail in showing that @Acosta was denied due process in credential revocation
Judge says that under Sherrill precedent, government must give Acosta due process to revoke press pass
Judge Kelly now saying that process of White House credentialing essentially concedes that there is a First Amendment interest at stake
Judge Kelly made a point of noting that @Acosta declined to surrender mic at Nov. 7 press conference

Trump, Daily Caller repeat unproven claim by Fox News host Tucker Carlson that protesters broke his door: https://t.co/QLHKFwPFbT
@Acosta It's this very line of thinking that could easily be deployed to yank credentials from other journalists, as Trump himself last week signaled he might just do.
@Acosta Based in part on that thinking, the gov't opposes CNN's request for a TRO reinstating @acosta hard pass. But a key question: Just how many other tenacious-question-asking journalists are necessary? Ten, twenty, 150?
@Acosta The public, says the response, "is additionally well-served by the 	journalists who retain their hard passes and who will continue to tenaciously ask questions at press events, just as they have done since the revocation of Mr. Acosta’s pass."
Another thing about the lawsuit from @acosta / CNN v. White House: In its response to the complaint, gov't lawyers argue that while Acosta is on the sidelines, there are plenty of other reporters on the beat.

As for Judge Kelly, I cannot tell which way he is leaning
Boutrous is back now, blasting argument by Burnham that @Acosta could just watch WH proceedings on tube. Journalism is not watching TV, he argues.
Judge Kelly now asking whether government rationale for revocation has shifted. No, says Burnham. @AaronBlake
@JennaNeen Don’t think so, no
And Burnham says harm to @Acosta is “narrow” bc Trump doesn’t ever have to call on him at press events or talk to him even if he had a hard pass for access to the grounds. Comment: Burnham doesn’t get journalism
Burnham: “As for CNN, I don’t think there’s any harm at all,”	Citing all the other journos with hard passes
Burnham is now disputing any notion that CNN/Acosta have suffered immediate and irreparable harm from hard-pass revocation
@cheapoldbstd @Acosta No, i put that part behind a dash to signal that that was my thought
Burnham says that “Mr. Acosta is welcome to continue to apply” for day passes and the like. Thanks.
Burnham says revocation of hard pass is merely an extrapolation of decision to give on news outlet an interview over another.
So: Government case really boils down to an argument that @Acosta is rude and disruptive and thus can have his pass revoked — by a thoroughly rude and disruptive man.
On process Burnham goes back to argument that disrupting a press conference is not an arbitrary reason for revocation of credentials
Burnham: “what happened was good enough to satisfy due process” for revocation of @Acosta credentials
Also: “Grandstanding...is not a viewpoint.”—-USG lawyer Burnham
Burnham: “A single journalist’s attempt to monopolize a press conference is not a viewpoint.”
Burnham says that there no case for viewpoint discrimination against CNN bc network has about 50 hard passes
Burnham and Judge Kelly now deep in the Sherrill case and how that case applied to Acosta revocation
Burnham is now citing case in which Baltimore Sun reporters contested shutout directed by former Md Gov. Robert Ehrlich
USG lawyer says WH argument doesn’t depend on the “places his hands on an intern” point initially put forth by @PressSec. And he relies on argument that @Acosta conduct wa such that WH couldn’t run an orderly press briefing
Boutrous: “Knowing President Trump, he’ll probably call on Jim Acosta the first day he gets his press pass back.”
Boutrous and Judge are now discussing the TRO request, and I cannot believe that we are all paying for four government lawyers to appear in court to fight for the revocation of a reporter’s White House credentials.
Boutrous says that since WH has opened itself to media with credentialing process, the act or revoking a particular reporter’s access triggers First Amendment protections
Judge Kelly asks why revocation process wasn’t sufficient. Boutrous responds that THERE WAS NO PROCESS
“Rudeness is not a standard,” says Boutrous on reason for revocation, invoking Sam Donaldson.
Boutrous saying there are much more “tailored” ways of dealing with Acosta, like not calling in him at briefings
Boutrous argues that WH has abandoned argument about Acosta placing his hands on an intern during famous mic standoff
Judge Kelly wants to know why, if Trump is perpetrating content discrimination, why didn’t such a credential revocation happen before Nov. 7
Boutrous on Trump: “He’s the most aggressive, dare I say rude, person in the room.”
“Content-based evidence is overwhelming” says Boutrous, who brings up a Trump campaign email citing CNN bias
Kelly says there is some evidence that it was Acosta’s behavior and not viewpoint that triggered revocation. Says there is “evidence on both sides”
Judge Kelly asks CNN counsel whether revocation if @Acosta revocation was content discrimination on its face. Yes, says Ted Boutrous, repping CNN
Proceedings now underway at federal courthouse

President Trump appears oblivious to the fact that he's president of the United States: "I have people jumping out of their seats, screaming questions at me," he complains at presser.
@owillis Attacks on the media are Trump's most consistent policy.
It would be appropriate at this point if one of the questioners at this Trump press conference pushed the president on how he just treated CNN and NBC News. That's an issue as big as gridlock and tax cuts.
@workinwithwords True, though Trump has been so prolific on the false stuff that news orgs haven't been able to keep up. I am not suggesting that news orgs shouldn't *cover* the event. Question is whether they should do it live.
The president is handling this press conference like an inexperienced Kindergarten teacher. "Sit down!" "You rudely interrupted him."
"Sit down," Trump is now berating Peter Alexander of NBC News.
"You're a very rude person," says Trump, as press conference goes off the rails. "Just sit down, please," he is now saying to Peter Alexander.
The president's mood and demeanor in this press conference contradict his cheery assessment of Republican outcomes in the midterms. Very surly.
President Trump's response to the inevitability of searing oversight by House Democrats: Leak investigations. News media beware.
All three cable channels are carrying Trump's press conference live, despite the hazard that he'll say a bunch of false stuff.
"The media coverage set a new record, and a new standard." -- @realDonaldTrump on the midterms, in an ongoing White House press conference.
Asked about how the Senate Rs would respond to the House pushing to get President Trump's tax returns, Mitch McConnell starting riffing about "presidential harassment."

CNN now makes its official projection that Dems will win the majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.
CNN calls the Senate for the Republicans.

Harry Enten just issued CNN's projection that the Democrats will take control of the House.
Trump blamed Democrats for "fake news" that Josh Hawley left rally early. Meanwhile, a Fox News correspondent has apologized for saying precisely that: https://t.co/1WAnLChqIA

Moments ago, Fox News correspondent Kristin Fisher apologized for a Monday evening report saying candidate Josh Hawley had left Trump rally venue in Mo. Trump had said he was “leading” in the race, not “leaving” the rally.

@NicolleDWallace ....And, predictably, this address by @realDonaldTrump is just a clump of caravan hype. It's a campaign rally without the crowd. MSNBC is 100 percent correct to blow off live airing.

Simply cannot believe that @NicolleDWallace doesn't want to go live with Trump's declaration that "we have thousands of tents."
Fox News and CNN are both carrying Trump's immigration remarks live. MSNBC is sticking with @NicolleDWallace show, perhaps on the thinking that this guy will just fearmonger.
Which way will country clubbers in Downers Grove, Ill. swing next Tuesday? via @chucklane1 https://t.co/J0hV9ZJl99
@chayesmatthew Not sure.
And here's the point of all this: In just a few weeks, Fox News is launching Fox Nation, an entirely new stream of (web) programming that springs from the network's opinion people. So: Much, much more of the same.
Most all of the fear-mongering is coming from the so-called opinion side of Fox News, though it's better labeled the "propaganda side" of Fox News. We're talking Hannity, Ingraham, Carlson, etc.
Fox News has happily laundered hype about the Central American caravan making its way to the U.S. border, a vein of coverage that defaults to "invasion" fears. See this mashup from the Daily Show: https://t.co/7UFvoX6Kcm
This comes after a Fox Business executive was forced to condemn Soros-conspiracy BS that had been uttered last week on Lou Dobbs' show.

In a compelling back and forth, @Acosta asked @presssec to ID those media outlets that are the enemies of the people. At first she refused, but did cite a statement last week by @CNN prez Jeff Zucker.
Asked whether it would be better if the president reserved "enemy of the people" for actual enemies and not the media, Sanders says the president hasn't said all media outlets are enemies of the people.
Now @presssec saying that it's 'outrageous' that anyone other than the person doing the crime would bear responsibility for it.
"Outrageous," says @presssec, alleging that media blamed Trump from get-go for the mail bombs.
Here's @presssec on Trump's rhetoric: "Certainly the president wants...to find ways to bring our country together, and we've seen him do that. "
"We all have a duty to confront anti-Semitism in all its forms," says @presssec Sarah Sanders in rare briefing at the White House.
Speaking of man arrested for mail bombs, Trump just told reporters, "I heard he was a person who preferred me over others."

Sulzberger now saying that they've done surveys on the unifying traits of NYT readership. It's "curiosity," he says.
City journalism is "systematically failing" all across the country, says Sulzberger.

"An independent press isn't a liberal ideal," says Sulzberger at #citizen conference sponsored by @cnn.

I don't have internal network correspondence on this decision, but I do know this: Fox Business waited until the Trump administration made its own move--a circumstance that doesn't quite portray the network as a neutral and fiercely independent news source.
During almost that entire deliberation period, the Trump administration was in a similar crouch -- evaluating its participation. Then, just hours ago, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin announced his pullout.
The news comes after a week or so that Fox Business has been weighing a pullout from the event, a period that saw the quick withdrawal of U.S. media outlets including New York Times, CNN and CNBC and others.
Fox Business Network has pulled out of Saudi conference: "FOX Business Network has canceled its sponsorship and participation in the Future Investment Initiative conference in Saudi Arabia. We continue to seek an interview with Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman."

Dissing the email as phony, said Gahr, damaged his reputation. "Yeah, I got money," said Gahr after today's session. That disclosure, he added, would provide Carlson an opening to sue him and get his money back.
When https://t.co/eikZBZo5ou asked Carlson about that email, the Fox News host responded that it was fabricated, according to Gahr's complaint. A reporter with https://t.co/eikZBZo5ou confirmed to me that Carlson called it "fake."
The libel complaint stemmed from a complicated circumstance: Gahr had given https://t.co/eikZBZo5ou an email that he'd exchanged long ago with Carlson; it places Carlson in a negative light.
Gahr's Daily Caller contract was terminated in December 2016, after Carlson had relinquished management duties at the site. In a flurry of small-claims filings, however, Gahr attempted to hold Carlson accountable for various alleged infractions.

@nytimes @GlennKesslerWP @PolitiFact Who knows whether this will have any impact at all on Trump's following. Probably not, considering all the scandalous things that media outlets exposed before the 2016 presidential election.
@PostScottWilson 100 percent correct. The investigative work on Trump before the election was massive and on-point. This adds depth, a lot of it.
@nytimes Consider how much reportorial muscle these days goes into fact-checking modules at WaPo (@GlennKesslerWP), @PolitiFact etc. --  teams that pat down Trump misstatements as they occur. Now consider going back 35-40 years and performing essentially the same task.
@nytimes ...The core fact remains that Donald Trump throughout his professional life has dedicated himself to deception, and this project demonstrates how much effort is required to track down and correct all the falsehoods and lies.
@nytimes That is a well-placed critique. As has been well-documented, Trump manipulated New York journalists with gossip, access, etc. But...
In more than one spot, the @nytimes team faults journalists for not having caught on to Trump's deceptions as they were taking place -- a critique that includes the New York Times.

Interesting that Kavanaugh slammed cable-news wall-to-wall coverage of the accusers, given that he himself sat for an interview on Fox News on Monday.

This Senate hearing is affording just such an opportunity, and people get to judge for themselves just how coherent and convincing is the accuser. So far, very.
But we don't get to see how the accuser handles questions in real time about their sexual assaults, which is a critical factor for media outlets in deciding whether or not to publish.
When media outlets publish the claims of an on-the-record accuser, we get to see, on paper, the quotes and also the other strands of evidence about the alleged event.
The ongoing Senate hearing with Christine Blasey Ford drives at an important dynamic with implications for how media organizations handle these sorts of allegations.

Every time Trump calls @MichaelAvenatti a "lowlife," he does wonders for his law practice, political future.
Trump is saying, not for the first time, that Kavanaugh has the chance to be among the best justices in Supreme Court history. Can someone ask him to name his top 10 justices, stretching back to 1790.
Trump says that Schumer &amp; Co. are "laughing, how they fooled you all." He didn't cite any sources for the laughter allegation.
At press conference, Trump riffs on what Dems are doing behind closed doors on Kavanaugh allegations: "They laugh like hell about what they pulled off on you [the media, that is] and the public."
@jaketapper @MichaelAvenatti Do you think that by turning down your sincere offer, though, that Avenatti may be ratcheting up pressure on the Senate?
@15minsjamieb @jaketapper @MichaelAvenatti Well, if you look at what happened after the New Yorker story on Ramirez: People seized on "memory gaps" and other qualifications in the story, in ways that may have diminished pressure on the Senate to arrange for her testimony.
@jaketapper @MichaelAvenatti Meaning, in sum: @MichaelAvenatti is trying to feed his client's allegations directly into federal/congressional investigators, sidestepping media inquiries.
@jaketapper @MichaelAvenatti Furthermore: Avenatti has declined to make Swetnick available to the New York Times. https://t.co/Wn5qDTrcxG
@jaketapper @MichaelAvenatti And @MichaelAvenatti replied, in essence, no. He said the "Jake Tapper Show" -- actually, "The Lead w/Jake Tapper" -- wasn't the appropriate investigative organ for this sort of matter.

That job belongs to editors, as does the task of cleaning up the mess. That part was well done here.
The breakdown here is one of editing: Whose job is it to take a step back and ask: What sort of message are we sending here? Why are we sliming Haley in the headline? Does it fairly reflect the bureaucratic lag in procuring furnishings for an ambo's residence?
The mention of "her curtains" implies some sort of involvement by Haley, even though the story made clear -- midway through the text -- that it wasn't her doing.
Even the original headline -- “Nikki Haley’s View of New York Is Priceless. Her Curtains? $52,701" -- isn't factually fraught. That doesn't mean that it's not problematic, though, as many on Twitter have pointed out.
Interesting that it's an "editor's note" and not a clarification, correction or retraction. That's because, so far as I can tell, there was no factual error in the original story whatsoever.

One staffer, frustrated with the lack of transparency, told Rhodes that he's leaving staffers to guess whether the grounds for firing Fager were "bigger than a bread box."
As the meeting was churning along uncomfortably, Fager's statement about the text message to a CBS News reporter surfaced on the web. So a "60 Minutes" staffer pressed Rhodes on the matter. He again refused to get into specifics.
They wanted to know: Just what company policy had Fager violated to deserve this dismissal. Rhodes refused to discuss the incident, saying that it would be unfair to Fager and others.
Just spoke with two sources who attended a "60 Minutes" staff meeting with CBS News President David Rhodes. First and foremost, the staff was pissed.
A question: Now that CBS News has fired Fager for what appears to be a misdemeanor violation of company policy, will it proceed with investigations of his alleged sexual harassment and harboring an abusive manager?
And here is the statement from Jeff Fager, consistent with the Rhodes statement: https://t.co/dIjJzSwVs1

Now Trump is accusing Bob Woodward of having "credibility problems." Previously called him fair. https://t.co/oAgjDNKJnr
And so I am proposing a brand-new question for the 2020 primary debates: "If elected, how will you handle Bob Woodward?"
@mcnicolpants Remarkable, in fact. Candid, informative.
The strategy of Trump's aides -- if you want to call it that -- appears to have been: Don't let Woodward anywhere near the president.
Other White Houses, too, have had to carefully strategize their approach to Woodward's work.
In his excellent memoir on the Clinton White House, George Stephanopoulos obsesses over the access accorded to Woodward -- a move that, he writes, caused him trouble with his colleagues.

@KFILE Given Bill Shine's history at Fox News, we already know all about the awful, offensive content and behavior that he either endorsed or enabled or ignored for 20 years or so of his professional career.
@KFILE And here's where I wonder about this story: Darla Shine is not a White House aide; Bill Shine is. To what degree are Darla Shines radio-show comments from 2008-09 news in 2018? I would rate it marginal, especially in light of this:
@KFILE All that said, the story notes that the White House didn't respond to a Q as to whether Bill Shine endorsed these comments.
@KFILE The comments from Darla Shine unearthed by @kfile are offensive and awful -- anti-vax stuff and mockery of military victims of sexual harassment.
@KFILE In this case, @kfile has dredged up the lamentable radio commentary of Darla Shine, wife of recently hired White House aide Bill Shine, formerly of Fox News.

@NickBaumann @RosieGray @perlberg Well, again: Read the article, which contains this: "sometimes, she admitted, it got complicated: She would make a mental note of tidbits he mentioned offhand, or gossip with him about Capitol Hill, or throw out a fact and gauge his reply."
@NickBaumann @RosieGray @perlberg Got it. That sounds like what the NYT did. And what HuffPost, BuzzFeed and Politico didn't do.
@NickBaumann @RosieGray @perlberg The indictment contained a text message in which Wolfe said he'd always tried to give her as much info as possible to help her get scoops. That conflicted with what Watkins had said.
@ashleyfeinberg @RosieGray @AliWatkins @perlberg Not Hannity's, of course.
@ashleyfeinberg @RosieGray @AliWatkins @perlberg Point taken! But some of those arguments would have been valid.
@NickBaumann @RosieGray @perlberg So no matter how you slice it, the indictment injected new information into the fact pattern, as you call it.
@NickBaumann @RosieGray @perlberg I did another tweet continuing with my argument.
@NickBaumann @RosieGray @perlberg So there wasn't a problem for Watkins as an employee going forward. Then, the indictment suggested something altogether different, and NYT takes steps to address the matter. That is the fact pattern.
@NickBaumann @RosieGray @perlberg As the story itself says, managers decided that there wasn't an issue at the time of hiring because Watkins said she hadn't used Wolfe as a source AND she wasn't covering the Sen. Intel Committee.
@NickBaumann @RosieGray @AliWatkins @perlberg Nick: They put her on a different beat -- not because of her ties to Wolfe but because they had the Sen. Intel committee covered. Another thing: She was no longer in the relationship when she acceded to the Times. So what did they do wrong?
@NickBaumann @RosieGray @AliWatkins @perlberg Deemphasized? Here's the text: "In December, before she started work at The Times, Ms. Watkins told the paper’s national security editor, Amy Fiscus, about her previous relationships with staff members of the Senate committee..." What more do you want?
@NickBaumann @RosieGray @AliWatkins @perlberg I thought it had a decent balance of material. Look: We can go back and forth about whether chocolates should be in there or whatever. ANY story can be hacked to death in hindsight.
@RosieGray @AliWatkins @perlberg As a thought experiment, consider what hell the New York Times would have faced if it *hadn't* done a thorough story on her career history. Everyone from https://t.co/pjuOadSPGs to Sean Hannity would have railed about lack of transparency, "coverup!"
@RosieGray @AliWatkins It is *not* a different issue. Nor is it retaliation. She became a person of tremendous newsworthiness because of her mention in a federal indictment. The Times responded accordingly. @perlberg
@RosieGray @AliWatkins And if you were executive editor of the New York Times, how would you feel if a reporter learned of FBI seizure of his/her communications records and decided to keep that fact to him/herself?
@perlberg Is the story's kicker all we're arguing about here?
@RosieGray @AliWatkins Is that all you have to buttress your case that it was gratuitous?
@perlberg So, how would you have handled it? You have a federal indictment alleging a reporter-source romantic relationship of four years. Do you respond with a 400-word brief? Or do you explain what happened?
@RosieGray @AliWatkins Or, transparent and accountable.
@perlberg Are you suggesting that the New York Times shouldn't have written about the involvement of its own reporter in a federal leak investigation?
@RosieGray @AliWatkins Is it not possible to acknowledge that there is more than one issue at hand here? The first clearly being federal overreach. The second being the act of reporting on the Senate Intel Committee for years while in a relationship with a top staffer.

At White House, reporters tried to secure comment from @potus on Capital Gazette shooting. He walked by without engaging.
Fox News's Trace Gallagher says they checked into Capital Gazette's ideological bent and concluded that it was very much a local newspaper.
Would love to see one of these networks pull back from this second-to-second coverage, and return to the matter when there is something to say.
Particularly worthless is the commentary from the obligatory "law enforcement analyst" providing generic input as to what the authorities are likely doing right now.
Ali Velshi at MSNBC concludes his hour by saying that there may be things they got wrong, but unfortunately what they didn't get wrong is that there was another mass shooting in America.
And having watched this routine way too many times, I can say that this very moment is cable news at its inconclusive worst -- filled with quasi-speculation couched with caveats that "we don't know for sure."
All three major cable news networks are now fully deployed on Capital Gazette shooting reports.
On @cnn, @brianstelter says that the Capital Gazette is the kind of organization that makes journalism great. Says that event is causing alarm in other newsrooms.
CNN is reporting that there are multiple people who "may have been shot" at the Capital Gazette.

@CliffYaffe What station was this?
On the media front, Fox News saw what despicable behavior Lewandowski exhibited last night during his womp-womp spectacle. Then it invites him back for another chat, this time with no one opposing him.
Asked if he should apologize, Lewandowski says "An apology?" Incredulous. He says apologies are owed to families who've been victimized by crimes committed by undocumented immigrants.
Lewandowski says parents who come to border are doing a "disservice to their families" by crossing into the United States.
Sandra Smith notes that Lewandowski is a parent. "Nobody wants to see children separated from their parents," says Lewandowski.
"I can hear the anger in your voice, Corey," says Sandra Smith to Lewandowski, who appears to be recommitting himself to his "womp womp" comment of last night.
"I don't know the young girl that Zac was referencing," says Lewandowski. He says he was mocking Zac, a "liberal."
Corey Lewandowski is back on Fox News right now with Sandra Smith.

@OfftoaFlyngStrt @EricBoehlert @NYT It was used. The NYT just didn't use the audio.
Right now in a D.C. speech before the NFIB, Trump rips the "fake news" media for allegedly "helping these smugglers, these traffickers like nobody would believe."
I, too, think it makes sense. Interviewees have a fair expectation of knowing how a news outlet plans to use the material. https://t.co/H6Bdt3dK5Z
The New York Times has issued a statement on why it complied with a White House request not to use audio of its Stephen Miller interview on "The Daily" podcast. https://t.co/Lzo3qVHVg6
In the podcast itself, @juliehdavis did indeed quote Miller; they just didn't use Miller's own voice, which would have enhanced the production quite a bit.
@juliehdavis @nytimes In the best of circumstances, the @nytimes would have apprised Miller that they wanted to use his voice in a podcast. That said, if the comments were on the record, the @nytimes can decide how to use it.
@juliehdavis It appears that the @nytimes complied with the White House's insistence that Miller's voice not be used.
@juliehdavis When the White House found out that Miller's voice would be on a podcast, "they were not happy about it, so they asked us not to use it," said @juliehdavis in the podcast.
&gt;@juliehdavis said that when she and a colleague went in to interview Miller, they said the purpose was a "deep dive" story and didn't mention any "alternative uses" for the interview.

@seanmdav Right, and I've tried to get an answer about that lag. Have gotten no answer whatsoever.
@BobbyHampshire2 It would seem to require a superhuman level of discipline, and the indictment alleges that Wolfe messaged to her about how he "always tried to give you as much information that I could..."
@seanmdav Yup. There's a fair bit here to rummage through.
Now, that's a much broader denial, one suggesting that the two had a very sturdy firewall between professional and personal realms.
Now the Times, in a story announcing that the newspaper is reviewing Watkins' work history, reports that Watkins says Wolfe "did not provide her with information during the course of their relationship."
In its original report on the matter, the New York Times reported that Watkins said Wolfe hadn't been source of "classified information for Ms. Watkins during their relationship." https://t.co/4DdKU7HuZt
According to the federal indictment, Watkins had a multi-year relationship with the security director for the Senate Intel Committee. A guy named James Wolfe.

@brianstelter Just scroll back a year or so and consider the brouhaha over Kathy Griffin, or the run-ins between White House correspondent Jim Acosta and the administration, or the retraction of the Scaramucci story.
@brianstelter The authoritarian tweets from President Trump about CNN's allegedly "fake news" is only the most obvious instance.
@brianstelter Modern-day CNN, however, provides a rich and ample feast of controversies that result from its position right at the center of the most divisive issues of the day.

On CNN, @brianstelter says it'll be "hard to unscramble the egg" if the government continues trying to block AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger, despite warning from judge.

Jay Wallace, as part of this shift, will be sole president of Fox News and executive editor as well, reporting to Suzanne Scott. Abernethy will move to L.A. to oversee more closely an expanded Fox Television Stations Group.
Now she's running the whole thing, essentially leapfrogging the previous co-presidents, Jay Wallace and Jack Abernethy.
Suzanne Scott, prior to this promotion, served as the head of programming at Fox News, meaning that she supervised the dregs of the network: "Fox &amp; Friends," "Hannity," "Tucker Carlson Tonight," etc. Opinion stuff.
21st Century Fox Chairman Lachlan Murdoch announcing that Suzanne Scott has been elevated to CEO of Fox News and Fox Business Network, in a pretty big corporate reshuffling.

I always suspected Gina Haspel was a close reader of the Erik Wemple Blog.
@DevoDalek Yes.
@chrislhayes In any case, good poll, Chris.
In confirmation hearing, Gina Haspel says she didn't "appear" in interrogation tapes, elbows "press" for having reported as much.
@chrislhayes Consider Sean Hannity. He'll get on his show and talk about the "sources" who are telling him this or that. I wonder just how plural those "sources" are, considering how much we know about Hannity's pipeline to @potus.
@chrislhayes Correct. SAO, to the casual reader, summons associations of "deputy assistant secretary," "chief of staff," and so on. Not @potus.
@chrislhayes Sometimes you just have to go with "source," and leave it at that.
@chrislhayes "Source close" suggests it's another person, so that's a no-no. "Source familiar" has the same problem. An everyday reader wouldn't suppose that the president himself would be behind those formulations.
Just how much torture did Gina Haspel oversee? Depends on the media outlet. https://t.co/sAvX3tCr0e

'Scripted' controversy: CNN releases emails of correspondence with Haab family prior to town hall event: https://t.co/8LRM2ZWOxf
It bears pointing out that CNN producer Carrie Stevenson talked on the phone with Colton Haab about the question, in which the student himself proposed pairing his comment from "Fox &amp; Friends" with the question he'd proposed, according to CNN.
Now have a look at the email that CNN was asked to comment upon Friday afternoon. "that he submitted" isn't there : https://t.co/pz4dr841ov
Here's the email released by CNN that represents that interaction. Note the part that indicates "that he submitted": https://t.co/ajHOBU1V8T
CNN has maintained that it paired a question submitted by Colton Haab with a prefatory statement that he'd made previously on a "Fox &amp; Friends" appearance. Which is to say, they wanted Haab to merely recite what he'd already said.
As part of their due diligence efforts, Fox News and HuffPost presented CNN with the exchanges. CNN alleges that one of the emails forwarded by these outlets cuts off a few words that are critical to understanding the back-and-forth.
According to a CNN spokesman, those two outlets had received a "doctored" version of the correspondence that made it appear as if CNN had dictated a question to 17-year-old Colton Haab.
CNN is now releasing copies of the network's email exchanges with the Haab family after receiving inquiries this afternoon from the HuffPost and Fox News.

@torquevector00 @BigMommaFinch2 I don't know. I contacted Hatch's office but didn't hear back yesterday. Apologizing to the women directly first seems like a solid move, however. Maybe a public apology is forthcoming.
The letter itself is on official Senate letterhead, measures a page and a half and carries a handwritten note -- "a prayer for good wishes and blessings," says Willoughby.
Willoughby: "I feel like it's a sincere apology and having been in D.C. for upwards of 12-13 years, I feel like this is sufficient given what i know to be true." Requests for comment to Hatch's office haven't yet fetched a response. 5/
Willoughby told me that the apology aligned with previous explanations from Hatch's office -- that the initial statement was "based on how the situation was described to him." Hatch was under the impression that "political enemies" were after Porter, said Willoughby. 4/
After further allegations against Porter -- plus photographic evidence of his alleged abuse -- Hatch issued another statement calling domestic violence "abhorrent." 3/
The reason for the apology was the initial statement that Hatch issued as the Porter scandal emerged. The senator defended his former aide: "He is kind and considerate towards all" and slammed the "character assassins" going after him. 2/
Sen. Orrin Hatch has sent letters of apology to Jennie Willoughby and Colbie Holderness, ex-wives of former White House staff secretary Rob Porter. 1/

@drvarg01 @wcp Yes, no one will get a pay cut.
@wcp In all, an encouraging conversation with a guy whose priorities seem to align with @wcp history: "I really deeply believe in the importance of good journalism, especially in today's day and age." -- Mark Ein.
@wcp On the challenge of making a @wcp that loses less money: "This is not easy. I spent a lot of my life investing in growth areas, where the wind is at my back. This is definitely wind in your face." -- Mark Ein.  4/
@wcp On how long he'd sustain the paper's losses and keep it going: "Many years," said Ein. Asked whether "many years" meant 10 or 20 or something else, he declined to specify.
@wcp On whether all the boldface names whom he's recruited to assist him will cause conflicts of interest: "No one's touching" editorial -- Mark Ein 3/
On the paper's roughly $300,000 in annual losses: "This is not making money and has not made money in a long time....and it's not going to be profitable for the foreseeable future." -- Mark Ein.
Just got off the phone with Mark Ein, who will be the next owner of @wcp.  On staffing: "Over time, we'll add to it." 1/
@sorrykb I am sorry, wasn't trying to do anything cheesy with this thing.
@wcp And let's be perfectly clear-eyed about this: There are NO optimal ownership/business scenarios these days when it comes to the production of local news. It is a slog everywhere.
@willsommer @wcp You beat me to it!
@wcp That said, this is a very good outcome for the Washington City Paper, especially in light of other possibilities: https://t.co/e1g440jz72 And it sure beats the mystery-owner scenario that gripped the LA Weekly.
Now: That's quite a series of bold names. So, @wcp gains a new owner plus a number of conflicts of interest, as well.
@wcp Then there's this group: https://t.co/OhYVU6pESi
@wcp To 're-energize' the Washington City Paper, Ein has convened two groups: One is an assemblage of WCP alumni including Jake Tapper, Ta-Nehisi Coates and Kate Boo.
The plan is to keep Alexa Mills as the editor of @wcp, and then things get really interesting. 2/
Mark Ein, venture capitalist and philanthropist, has reached an agreement to buy the Washington City Paper, the parties are announcing tonight.

The Current's consistent and invariably fair-minded coverage of community disputes, land-use issues and D.C. sports -- that's the work of Kain.
Over those 26 years, Kain has established himself as the Cal Ripken of local news. Since the publication went weekly in '97, he has missed four production nights, if that.

@realbradadkins He loves the softball stuff, too. There's no clean, linear explanation regarding his preferences and habits on this front.
They are doing their job by moving the discussion along, and Trump -- in love with his own voice -- appears happy to oblige.
Is why he says what he says, regardless of who's interviewing him. Because read the transcript: NYT reporters aren't posing brilliant Qs.
We know why Trump is always talking to the New York Times, and that's because it's the New York Times. The more pressing question...

@scfehr1 Good question! They've been doing it with presidents for years.

That looks a lot like a quote-approval arrangement.
Shouldn't it be the journalists who put out the excerpts? And wouldn't it be troubling if WH chose excerpts of an off-record session?
Of course, the 'excerpts' thing raises questions: Is the White House putting out excerpts? Did it record the off-the-record session?
