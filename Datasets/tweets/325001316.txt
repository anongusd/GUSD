The point here: Cohen's powerful testimony that Trump looked him in the eye with an implicit instruction to lie is NEW, and not reflected in the Southern District court documents. https://t.co/fb39yLwPqR

In sentencing memo, Cohen's lawyer did not say Trump implicitly instructed him to lie. "Michael’s false statements to Congress sprung regrettably from Michael’s effort, as a loyal ally...of Client-1, to support and advance Client-1’s political messaging." https://t.co/qH8f4E2deU

@matthewamiller Makes sense.  And Trump asking to put Russia in the memo is arguably yet more evidence that if he was obstructing, he was doing it in plain site, not secretly.  Because he thought it was within his right to do so, perhaps.

One thing that comes across is that McCabe was not willing to stand up to Trump.  Not even to defend his wife.  @gregpmiller points this out in his book review: https://t.co/KBxJ9kUOGH
@Jebster1964 @joshlockman Yes, it's been publicized, but I don't think we'd seen the full transcript.

"I don't care, I believe Putin."
McCabe seems to be saying that the predicate for the counterintelligence and obstruction investigations were things we all heard Trump say in public.  Hard to believe there isn't more than that, and unclear why McCabe didn't just say there is evidence he can't discuss.

Lots of people are raising this.  Legal experts tell me they do not believe Mueller would be that disingenuous.  It would be outrageous of them to dispute a piece of a story because a news organization misstated the affiliation of the DoJ employees who seized the documents. https://t.co/JmlJac5d1N
Mueller's strategy of saying nothing about anything has not served the public well. https://t.co/uAJvffXklZ
@matthewamiller Well, another way to look at it: They don't reams of texts and emails and a cache of documents.  But for corroboration, all they would need, according to the US Attorney's manual, is another witness.  They may or may not have that, right?
Seems pretty clear Mueller is disputing this graf:		"The special counsel’s office learned about Trump’s directive for Cohen to lie..through interviews with multiple witnesses from the Trump Organization and internal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents." https://t.co/RRizLTxKJQ

In conducting that review, the Attorney General will give great weight to the views of the Special Counsel.  (3)
However, the AG may request that the Special Counsel provide an explanation for any investigative or prosecutorial step, and may after review conclude that the action is so inappropriate or unwarranted under established Departmental practices that it should not be pursued. (2)
Just so people, Whitaker is not "running" or "managing" the Mueller probe. 		Here's what the regulations say: "The Special Counsel shall not be subject to the day-to-day supervision of any official of the Department. (1)
DoJ ethics officials have advised Whitaker he does not have a legal obligation to recuse, which is what most experts expected would happen.  Democrats had said his past statements raised questions about his impartiality, but the under the law that didn't *require* a recusal. https://t.co/B1zi6X755f

@emptywheel @LanaLakke I’d submit its silly to suggest Mueller reviewed whether Flynn committed a crime that clearly does not apply.  Nothing in the transcript actually suggests they ever considered it.
@SarahClapp No, the way deals work is you admit your crimes and get a lighter sentence for cooperating.  So even though Flynn isn’t charged on Turkey lobbying, it’s mentioned in his plea agreement.
@vermontgmg The national security adviser works secretly as a foreign agent in the White House and walks? That deal would make Sammy the Bull blush.  Color me skeptical, but as Trump likes to say, we’ll see what happens.
@EBOlady I would say that is highly unlikely.
@SarahClapp That is extremely hard to imagine.
@LanaLakke Actually no, that’s silly.  An enemy is a nation or an organization with which the United States is in a declared or open war.  Not applicable here.
If Flynn has been a foreign agent in the White House, would Mueller be recommending no jail time and moving ahead with sentencing? https://t.co/3SIE5xU4et
Much as I respect you guys, I am having trouble following the logic here.  Flynn was a foreign agent in the White House but Mueller didn’t charge him with that? And Van Grack obfuscates that fact in open court under questioning by the judge? https://t.co/QQD8i9D4f6

Mr. Flynn, anything else you want to discuss with me about	your plea of guilty? This is not a trick. I'm not trying to	trick you.
Is it your contention that any misconduct by a member of the FBI	raises any degree of doubt that Mr. Flynn intentionally lied to	the FBI?	MR. KELNER: No, Your Honor.
THE COURT: Do you believe his rights were violated by the	fact that he may have been dissuaded from having a lawyer present	for the interview?	MR. KELNER: No, Your Honor.
THE COURT: Do you believe Mr. Flynn's rights were	violated by the fact that he did not have a lawyer present for	the interview?	THE DEFENDANT: No, Your Honor.
THE COURT: Do you believe the FBI had a legal obligation	to warn Mr. Flynn that lying to the FBI was a federal crime?	MR. KELNER: No, Your Honor.	THE COURT: Is it your contention that Mr. Flynn was	entrapped by the FBI?	MR. KELNER: No, Your Honor.
Are you continuing to accept responsibility for your false	statements?	THE DEFENDANT: I am, Your Honor.
THE COURT: Your sentencing memo also states that	you pled guilty before revelations that 	FBI officials involved in theinterview were	themselves being investigated for "misconduct." Do you	seek to withdraw your plea in light of those	revelations?	THE DEFENDANT: I do not.
THE COURT: At the time of your January 24th, 2017	interview with the FBI, were you not aware that lying to FBI	investigators was a federal crime?	THE DEFENDANT: I was not -- I was aware.	THE COURT: You were aware?	THE DEFENDANT: Yeah.
THE COURT: Do you have any concerns that you entered your	guilty plea before you or your attorneys were able to review	information that could have been helpful to your defense?	THE DEFENDANT: No, Your Honor.
THE COURT: Do you understand that by maintaining your	guilty plea and continuing with sentencing, you will give up your	right forever to challenge the circumstances under which you were	interviewed?	THE DEFENDANT: Yes, Your Honor.
THE COURT: Do you wish to challenge the circumstances on	which you were interviewed by the FBI?	THE DEFENDANT: No, Your Honor.

@sean_ryland I know it sometimes confuses partisans, but our job is to call the balls and strikes as we see them.
@Hopewenttodie @TMcCartha Obama didn’t go on camera like he did when he called out North Korea for the Sony hack, so most Americans never heard about it.  That’s on him, not the media.
At the end of July — not long after WikiLeaks had dumped over 20,000 stolen DNC emails before the Democratic convention — it had become obvious to Brennan that the Russians were mounting an aggressive and wide‑ranging effort to interfere in the election. https://t.co/1SyvqrbJzE
@grantstern He wouldn’t have done that.The evidence at the time didn’t support it.  But he could have alerted the public to a foreign attack on our election.  Instead they released a sanitized paper statement on the day rbe access Hollywood tapes came out and  Obama didn’t go on TV about it.

Sen. Klobachar: If Flake is joined by one or two other Republicans in his request, then they won't have the votes to confirm Kavanaugh unless there is an FBI investigation.  It's as simple as that.
The Senate can't force the FBI to investigate.  Only the White House can.  But Flake is saying he won't vote for Kavanaugh on the floor without further investigation.
