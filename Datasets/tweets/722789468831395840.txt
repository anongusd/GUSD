So, I’m going to let you go and “Opinionate” (I know it’s not an official word but you get the meaning) all over the world. I personally choose to have this discussion with those of us who it directly effects. In the case of South FL and South TX, literally in our back yards. https://t.co/O8pO8ZEOCd
I may retweet someone from Britain’s opinion about Brexit but in no way do I feel I can be informed enough to pass my own judgment for Brits. I know how I feel about the EU but have not experienced being in the EU. It’s one thing to retweet. You are using media not experience. https://t.co/O8pO8ZEOCd
I’ve been working and paying taxes for 45 years! Most of those years I’ve been in the 30% tax bracket which is on the higher end for middle class in America. We have immigration laws that cannot be enforced without border barriers AND other resources too. BUT a border IS needed! https://t.co/6McxL7bBkr
That’s just it, you are depending on “the media” who has consistently attacked Trump. Fox allows both sides to express their opinion.

Sounds untrue. There was never free college in the 50s and 60s. College was a very elite privilege.

Maybe close to a billion. https://t.co/nZixhweGGK
“My Party” I was born in the 50s I had no party in the 60s MLK was a republican, not me. If you want to play that game, I guess it was “your party” who was fighting against civil rights and started the KKK. There wasn’t “free college” back then even with that tax bracket. https://t.co/nZixhweGGK
