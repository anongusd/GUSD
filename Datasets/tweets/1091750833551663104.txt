@sanfideljohn @lindalp111 @TheView @DNC @GOP @POTUS @AOC @realDonaldTrump @KamalaHarris Also chicken counting is inevitable when you are young, idealistic and REALLY inspired by a canidate for the first time.

@sanfideljohn @lindalp111 @TheView @DNC @GOP @POTUS @AOC @realDonaldTrump @KamalaHarris I'm with you on on all that. Ain't never been no RINO, but I'll take all the help we can get in taking down Trump. And yes, Kamala2020!
@sanfideljohn @lindalp111 @TheView @DNC @GOP @POTUS @AOC has the youth and demographics on her side. She's already mastered the next iteration of media. It's already undeniable she is the political leader of the party. It dosn't need to be said, it's already implied. Come 2028 if she stays the course, she will be the undeniable nominee
@sanfideljohn @lindalp111 @TheView @DNC @GOP @POTUS @AOC That's a real possibility. But I don't believe she will need to adap to the homogeneous style of politics. I believe the politics will need to adapt to her version of it. Similar to Donald Trump changing the nature of republican politics, I believe she will do the same. Only she
@lindalp111 @sanfideljohn @TheView @DNC @GOP @POTUS I don't feel like he's a bot or a lost cause. I just feel like he's someone who's been let down too many times and has lost hope and imagination. I can't even blame him...
@sanfideljohn @lindalp111 @TheView @DNC @GOP @POTUS I cant cantrol that. But I can use my voice to influence my party. My gen can. Primaries will come. If AOC turns out not to be the next king maker, it's only a matter of time till someone else will be. Someone is going to draw a red line in party soon over climate change action
@sanfideljohn @lindalp111 @TheView @DNC @GOP The scale of the solution needs to be the scale of the problem. This isn't political anymore. Someone is gonna see that and pounce on it soon. It's no longer politically advantageous to delay climate action. You are only radicalizing the next generation of possible dem socialists
@sanfideljohn @lindalp111 @TheView @DNC @GOP "protect their borders" and embrace nationalism? How soon b4 we live in a world where nationalist despots with their fingers on the triggers slip up and cause nuclear war? How soon before the economic costs of disaster relief becomes untenable? This isn't political. It's survival
@sanfideljohn @lindalp111 @TheView @DNC @GOP It dosent help when the old guard of the party are actively working against it. How many more years of consecutive 100 year floods is it going to take?
