@RealMAGASteve Here is a good article that shifts the lens from punishment to teaching and the why behind it: https://t.co/2etDnCtqEo
@RealMAGASteve Additionally it doesn‚Äôt teach the expected behavior ‚Äì it just teaches a consequence. Many students are coming to school not knowing the expectations of school. Even after it‚Äôs taught explicitly, many students need to be re-taught.
@RealMAGASteve If works for 80-90% of students who are non-repeaters. Our prison systems house the other 10-20% - most have a pattern of misbehavior and corporal punishment doesn‚Äôt work for them. Some actually like it.

@SusanLHendricks @CrushingPodcast @SophiaHelwani @lmcameron1313 @realDonaldTrump Apology accepted, I wasn‚Äôt trying to create a problem. I was genuinely trying to have a discussion and learn. It didn‚Äôt mean that I would change my views necessarily, but I am opening to hearing other points of them.
@SusanLHendricks @CrushingPodcast @SophiaHelwani @lmcameron1313 @realDonaldTrump Additionally, I am not so close minded that I can‚Äôt hear other peoples views and opinions from my own. Again, hence my attempt at a dialogue.
@SusanLHendricks @CrushingPodcast @SophiaHelwani @lmcameron1313 @realDonaldTrump Susan, I wasn‚Äôt looking for my research, rather his information and his opinion, hence the dialogue. I‚Äôm asking for the other side of the coin that he was referring to. I already have done my research and have formed my own views and opinions.
@SophiaHelwani @CrushingPodcast @SusanLHendricks @lmcameron1313 @realDonaldTrump Thank you! I appreciate that. It is difficult for different views to have a respectful conversation but it definitely can be done!
@CrushingPodcast @SusanLHendricks @SophiaHelwani @lmcameron1313 @realDonaldTrump I too have voted differently in the past, I just could not support her at all.
@CrushingPodcast @SusanLHendricks @SophiaHelwani @lmcameron1313 @realDonaldTrump Yes, Agreed. Actually this is the first time I have really sort of put myself out there to somebody about their views. It‚Äôs a shame that people like @SusanLHendricks want to just immediately shut down the conversation with immaturity.
@CrushingPodcast @SophiaHelwani @lmcameron1313 @realDonaldTrump I don‚Äôt actually watch any of the major news networks as I don‚Äôt find them completely credible. I research things myself and look at both sides. I think if you follow the money you can always figure out the intent of the source.
@CrushingPodcast @SophiaHelwani @lmcameron1313 @realDonaldTrump I would agree that when he goes off script, he does embellish or get things incorrect at times. I try to stick to the overall picture and how he is moving our country in a forward direction.
@SusanLHendricks @CrushingPodcast @SophiaHelwani @lmcameron1313 @realDonaldTrump Also, I have my Masters in Education. I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôre barking up the wrong tree here.
