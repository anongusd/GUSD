HR 1 will allow countless illegal votes to be cast in 2020 if it passes. Texas can’t afford more voter fraud, neither can the rest of America. https://t.co/1sV4ImsPhZ
Industry leaders in TX develop innovative solutions to complex problems. DC bureaucrats concoct radical programs to put the federal gov't in control of solving issues it's not equipped to address #SocialismTakesCapitalismCreates 		I say let Texans create.		https://t.co/aFdSXbeIRn
Democrats have made their agenda clear: a $90 trillion socialist takeover of our economy &amp; a $30 trillion plan to eliminate private health insurance. Socialism takes, while capitalism creates. Texans can spend their money better than DC bureaucrats. #GreenNewDeal #RepealObamacare
✅ Making stuff	✅ Inreasing wages	✅ Expanding opportunity		It’s working. https://t.co/5RB89PaLpj
The House agreed to notify ICE whenever an illegal immigrant buys a firearm.		Democrats responded by taking aim at the rules that allowed us to do so. Read more below: https://t.co/CJ3eOEZG5m
I voted NO on #HR8 today. This bill would make criminals out of law-abiding citizens while failing to prevent gun violence. https://t.co/L1XI8HtPyJ
WATCH TO THE END -- Democrats spent this hearing harassing execs from the credit report industry - one even bullied their staff for their race &amp; gender.		I called them out for their behavior and the Ds didn’t approve. Hearings should be serious - not partisan nonsense hours. https://t.co/0cQ1Ftlv8W
Democrats showing again that they only care about resistance. The President has the authority to determine and declare national emergencies, and was given that authority by Congress. 		Stunts like these do nothing to make our country safer - we must secure our border. #HJRes46
The anti-gun bills Democrats have put on the House floor this week would place undue burden on law-abiding citizens and fail to reduce violent crime. https://t.co/kEek9ubqdd
I've signed on as a co-sponsor to this legislation. The Mexican cartels have caused irreparable harm to our nation - let's use these seized funds and make them pay for the wall.		https://t.co/Xn0osc24re
I can’t imagine feeling such apathy toward great news. The realities behind these figures are LIFE CHANGING for so many Americans. We should celebrate these results - not dismiss them.		https://t.co/Nmh84pBlv0
This deal doesn't come close to meeting our needs at the border. I'll be voting against it. See my statement below: https://t.co/eEwcWXQO6S
The entire charade around the “Green New Deal” is a complete fraud on the American people - it’s barely formulated and deeply misguided policy.		https://t.co/Lo4cMbuBJG
What’s on the Floor today: We’ll vote on five bills that you can view here —-&gt; https://t.co/ylTqwfv73y
Had a great meeting with the folks from @TexasRuralWater today. We discussed the many opportunities to improve water quality, supply and infrastructure in our area. #TXWater https://t.co/lyybFnLIQw
No one wants to see the government shutdown again next Friday. It’s time for Democrats to show they are willing to find a solution that works for everyone. #SOTU https://t.co/yXVFHJEaMg
With only 10 days left before another funding deadline, it’s time to find a compromise on border security. Resistance accomplishes nothing when the well-being of Americans is on the line. #SOTU
President Trump has dramatically improved the state of our national security. Using the right combination of diplomacy and military action, he’s shown himself to be more than capable of leading us into a more stable future. #SOTU
If we are willing to work together, extraordinary bipartisan achievements are possible. Political discord can not be allowed to stop us from improving the lives of Americans. #SOTU https://t.co/tBtOvcz6aL
Tune in to @NBCDFW this afternoon to hear my expectations for tonight. #SOTU https://t.co/3lHVSMJpsS
Tonight, @POTUS will outline his plan to move America forward. The country needs Democrats to reject the politics of resistance and find common ground with the president - it is the only way forward. #SOTU
Tomorrow night, President Trump will deliver his State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress in the House of Representatives. His speech will be broadcast at 8:00 p.m. in Texas - click the link below to watch:		https://t.co/MCUEl65Iph
Among those to acknowledge the need for a physical structure to secure the border: law enforcement and border security agents, national security experts and over 60 Democrat elected officials. It’s time we come together to solve the problem.
Over the last two years, conservative policies have created millions of opportunities for Americans thanks to President Trump’s leadership. I look forward to seeing the president highlight the ways we'll continue to foster economic growth and higher wages. #SOTU
RT @GOPLeader: VA Governor Ralph Northam’s past racist behavior caps a week where he displayed an egregious lack of respect for human digni…
Top Democrats all said, “re-open the government, and then we’ll talk about the border”. Dozens of Democrats have said they support a physical barrier. The government is back open and it’s time to solve the problem.		https://t.co/CuAMpFCQBm
Today we begin #BlackHistoryMonth . I encourage all of us to appreciate the impact that countless African Americans have had on our nation. The story of America cannot be told without their contributions and their sacrifices.
Great to see yet another STRONG jobs report!		https://t.co/qKrqYqAVjj
Reminder that we have two weeks left to fund the wall and solve the crisis at our border! Let's work together and create a lasting solution BEFORE the funding deadline. https://t.co/L1moyQJCyu
Today I offered an amendment to the Democrats' rules for my committee requiring that the rules be made publicly available. Transparency is critical to good governance - unfortunately @FSCDems don't agree! They voted against my amendment and against government transparency today. https://t.co/G8LmczVIMj
House Democrats want you to think their bill is all about security and election integrity. But what it really does is A) allows voter fraud to increase, B) uses taxpayer dollars to fund their candidates and C) entrenches bureaucrats and the DC swamp.		https://t.co/OyQikvzOZX
Democrats are pushing H.R. 790 through the House today - this is nothing but a political stunt. They voted three times last week NOT to pay federal workers during the shutdown.
In case you missed it: I spoke on the House floor in support H.R. 624 and it passed with over 400 votes! This bill will require the SEC to improve their regulations to prevent illegal insider trading. https://t.co/CB1qbJ4t4M
For my first tweet I want to throw it back to last Thursday, when I took my official Oath of Office. It is such an honor to represent TX-05!		https://t.co/XhWbXtv83t
