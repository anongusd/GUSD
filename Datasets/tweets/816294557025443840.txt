Thank you, Anthony Bordain, for making the news just a little bit more delicious. You reminded us of the simple reason that many of us got into this field to begin with: the unexpected adventures we have along the way are often better than the story we set out to find.
Thank you, Charles Krauthammer, for challenging us to raise the bar for the discussions we have in a 24 hour news world. Your mind was one we all wish we had the smarts (and the guts) to debate.
No network wishes to break the story that they lost someone on their team. Today my heart broke while watching my friends and colleagues have to do just that at not one, but two networks that I called home for many years.
Three minute commercial breaks in the control room, location shoots that last for weeks, the breath before the election is called &amp; the second a breaking news banner changes everything: the stories that bind news team together are often the ones that never air.
