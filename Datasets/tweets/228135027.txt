@now_pain @1776Stonewall @realDonaldTrump Again with the name. Former Communist East Germany was officially ‚ÄúDeutsche Demokratische Republik‚Äù.

@babaoriley4321 @1776Stonewall @realDonaldTrump No. The NAZIs, in their time, rounded up and shot Socialists and Communists.

@DeborahLynn333 @1776Stonewall @realDonaldTrump Yes.

Within a year of Pearl Harbor we were fighting and winning a war on two major fronts.  No thanks to isolationists...
@LoveLig66141315 @1776Stonewall @realDonaldTrump So, by your rational, the Democratic People‚Äôs Republic of Korea (AKA North Korea) must certainly be a ‚Äòdemocratic republic‚Äô, eh? The NAZIs used the term ‚Äúsocialists‚Äù but certainly were not socialists...

@0Tamahawk3 @CWNBCIA @fearandbalanced @watspn1013 @MagaKirk @CNN Jeff, my contention -one has nothing to do with the other. Just a typical WHATABOUTISM distraction. Trump‚Äôs bias in Judge picks has NOTHING to do with the number of black players on NFL rosters. Actually a majority of black players on the field doesn‚Äôt even disprove NFL bias.
@0Tamahawk3 @CWNBCIA @fearandbalanced @watspn1013 @MagaKirk @CNN Actually, I never brought up the NFL or NBA or CBA or USFL or any other sports leagues. Someone else led us down that deflection rabbit hole. My contention Trump is racially biased in his Judge picks and his behavior demonstrates this stands...
@CWNBCIA @0Tamahawk3 @fearandbalanced @watspn1013 @MagaKirk @CNN Ha! Not stumbling on your silly math. Now your arguing all positions should be filled according to racial quotas. Ok. White males=25-30% of the population so we only need 2 or 3 on the SCOTUS. Let‚Äôs make everything equal by your math...
@CWNBCIA @0Tamahawk3 @fearandbalanced @watspn1013 @MagaKirk @CNN Ok I get it. Minorities and women aren‚Äôt ‚Äòrushing‚Äô to fill these positions. So that is why only white males need apply. ‚ÄúSilent racism‚Äù?
@CWNBCIA @0Tamahawk3 @fearandbalanced @watspn1013 @MagaKirk @CNN So now you‚Äôre arguing whites dominate coaching in a sport dominated by black players? We‚Äôve already determined that fact...
@CWNBCIA @0Tamahawk3 @fearandbalanced @watspn1013 @MagaKirk @CNN The number is closer to 70% - don‚Äôt exaggerate. But the number of players on rosters is a tiny part of the NFL. Blacks and other minorities are grossly underrepresented in coaching, management, lower and upper office positions across the NFL. Can‚Äôt use the NFL to make your point.
@CWNBCIA @fearandbalanced @watspn1013 @MagaKirk @CNN The left or right has nothing to do with Trump‚Äôs racism. You do know he lost federal housing discrimination lawsuits in the 70s right? It isn‚Äôt the left making this shit up...
@CWNBCIA @0Tamahawk3 @fearandbalanced @watspn1013 @MagaKirk @CNN Haha! You really wanna bring up the NFL to make a point about racism? The number of black players doesn‚Äôt prove the point you think you‚Äôre making. Seriously?
@CWNBCIA @0Tamahawk3 @fearandbalanced @watspn1013 @MagaKirk @CNN You are clearly delusional. Trump has made 90% white mostly male judge picks. All but 6 SCOTUS Justices in US history are/were white men. Clearly we pick judges based on color...
@CWNBCIA @fearandbalanced @watspn1013 @MagaKirk @CNN FYI The Donald has demonstrated his nativist, racist qualities in many other ways than just his judge picks. This is just another in a long line of clues dude...
@CWNBCIA @0Tamahawk3 @fearandbalanced @watspn1013 @MagaKirk @CNN Huh? ‚ÄúNative in his blood‚Äù? WTF does that even mean? Native what? Person of color - what? Your condescension and minimizing tone comes across as whitesplaining. Who can tell your ethnicity or demographic from your Avi?
@goodoldcatchy @bgsharpy  https://t.co/A1dMOzsSqw
@CWNBCIA @fearandbalanced @watspn1013 @MagaKirk @CNN No the simple answer is not ‚Äúno‚Äù. Racist acts don‚Äôt require specific intent. Trump has nominated no black judge and a scant few other minorities. He‚Äôs selected 90% white mostly male judges which implies he‚Äôs operating under a specific bias. Intentional or not...
@0Tamahawk3 @CWNBCIA @fearandbalanced @watspn1013 @MagaKirk @CNN Did we just get racism whitesplained? And yes we don‚Äôt know for sure The Donald based his decision on race - he certainly did not say so. But 90% white judge picks? His actions kinda speak a little louder than his words...

@JefferyEBullock Dummy is right. Me continually bashing my head against a brick wall of ignorance. My bad indeed...
@JefferyEBullock @DennisDMZ @michelleisawolf @PressSec Ohmygosh dude! It‚Äôs not racist because she wasn‚Äôt making a derisive comment based on SHS‚Äôs race.

@JefferyEBullock @DennisDMZ @michelleisawolf @PressSec When folks call other folks Uncle Toms based on a misrepresentation on a feature or attribute of their race then it‚Äôs racist. Is this example clear?
@JefferyEBullock Jeez who‚Äôs actually playing the victim Jeffery? Allow me to again repost your Tweet which drew reasonable response. Are you not offering a joke based on her skin-tone?

@Catalyst_317 @2runtherace @RealCandaceO @drawandstrike @seanhannity You‚Äôre overlooking the fact that 2016 is only the 2nd time in modern history a President is elected who didn‚Äôt capture the majority of votes. Of course all these voter suppression/correction things, however we perceive it, are gonna get looked at...
@Catalyst_317 @2runtherace @RealCandaceO @drawandstrike @seanhannity I‚Äôm a minority. I have an ID. That‚Äôs not the only issue. Closing down local DMVs, moving them far away from central areas, inconvenient hours of operation, little things adding up to unnecessary burdens for some folks. Not everyone drives cars. Other forms of ID should suffice..
@Catalyst_317 @2runtherace @RealCandaceO @drawandstrike @seanhannity Yes purging is useful for removing dead and those who‚Äôve left the area. However, in many of these key states 10s of 1000s of living, active voters were removed arbitrarily. And you‚Äôre right voter purges aren‚Äôt necessarily nefarious ... until they are.üòâ

@Catalyst_317 @2runtherace @RealCandaceO @drawandstrike @seanhannity True enough...
@Catalyst_317 @2runtherace @RealCandaceO @drawandstrike @seanhannity Purging, ID laws are suppression when targeting minorities (you know -race) and young voters. For example, in Wisconsin alone 200K voters were either purged or otherwise kept from voting. DJT won the election by only 78K votes in MI, PE, and WI - 200K less votes changes things.
@Catalyst_317 @2runtherace @RealCandaceO @drawandstrike @seanhannity As for GOP voter suppression efforts look up interstate cross check, voter roll purges, onerous Voter ID policies, gerrymandering, etc. Shit! There was even a recent effort by NH Republicans to bring back poll taxes! Not making this stuff up... https://t.co/X6d2zJ3035

@Catalyst_317 @2runtherace @RealCandaceO @drawandstrike @seanhannity How does that contradict the fact Southern Dems switched to Republicans after the Civil Rights Act Passage?

@silenceisnotawk @Vancecat1 @vm_marshmellow @GrammieJean @steph93065 @ChristiChat Over the past 200 years SCOTUS has ruled time and again that anyone ‚Äòphysically‚Äô in the country has constitutional rights.
