@_754 @datngu @Kotaku ELI5 lol
@datngu @_754 @Kotaku Objective facts can shape broad experience and perception of it, especially in this case. To rule out restaurants for a guy who's eaten like half of Hong Kong, in a convo about cultural perception, is a pretty big assumption. But hey, what do I know.
@datngu @_754 @Kotaku If you're really asking, there's a handful of researchers and doctoral students at just about every university publishing dissertations about modern racism/micro-aggressions every year. Easy to google but depressing to read.
@datngu @_754 @Kotaku With all due respect I thought the takeaway tonight was to not make assumptions about other people's experiences. But I guess even a purist like you is capable of that, ha.
@datngu @_754 @Kotaku Where did he say he was comparing home-cooked food to restaurant food?
@harrylinyiran @Kotaku Oh lol
@harrylinyiran @Kotaku There's nothing wrong with westerners learning Japanese and my comment isn't about that.
@fallowtreveller @mixielot Yeah I saw that on her page later. Feeling bad that no one seemed to pick up on it.
@datngu I was referring to asking about and hearing their experiences, not just my interactions with them. What then would be your suggestion for how to make the most of another's perspective?
@liliiilllliiili @Kotaku You forgot to hint in your satire that we still consider Americans' opinions to be relevant lol.
@datngu Pretty sure I said "close friends and family members who grew up into adults in East Asia", which is their experience, not mine.		Honestly I can't tell if you're just bored and trolling, or trying to have an actual conversation.
@Einchy @Kotaku Put it another way, it's great that people in Asia see this type of stuff and have the confidence to not care, and I wish the same was for Asians in the west. (I can't speak for everyone) but when we grow up hearing Asian languages/culture mocked all the time, it changes things.
@Einchy @Kotaku I believe you. I've seen vids of her speaking Japanese years ago and found it pretty impressive and adorable. But the whole kanji/hanzi tattoo thing falls into a certain umbrella that we've had to see repeatedly. I suppose some of us associate it with being stereotyped further.
@Einchy @Kotaku Oh, it isn't. I said Asians because I remember very similar things happening in the past that resulted in near-identical articles like "look at these examples of netizens in China not caring, therefore no one should". This is just another example of that, hence my "good ol'"
@Einchy @Kotaku Why does it have nothing to do with us? Plenty of Asian immigrants speak and read Asian languages.		Edit: hold on, I'm actually confused now. 	Kanji has "nothing to do with Asian people in the West", yet I don't hear you saying it has nothing to do with an Italian American. :|
@datngu @Kotaku Because I have close friends and family members who grew up into adults in East Asia and perceive racist comments completely differently (i.e. don't bat an eye at them). We've also had long conversations about it. No assumptions were ever made.
@liliiilllliiili @Kotaku Oh god. I'd actually thought this tweet was a direct reply to me and it wasn't. Sorry for being catty at a total stranger.
@rip_miguerino @Kotaku They certainly do overreact a lot in general. But my original comment is about Asian immigrants being rightfully offended. That's more specific than just American.
@liliiilllliiili @Kotaku I'm not American and I'm originally from Shanghai. Nice try at a "gotcha" though.
@datngu @Kotaku *effects aghhh
@datngu @Kotaku It's briefly mentioned in the article. When people have never experienced being a minority and didn't grow up with the negative affects of appropriation, they'll of course think people like me are being dramatic. But their reactions are then used to downplay our experiences.
@liliiilllliiili @Kotaku Yeah, they do think that, because they're being ignorant about something they think is too complicated.

@IveBeenTreaded True. In terms of even very mainstream games, Splatoon and any Mario game have 0 diversity, but only OW‚Äîone game‚Äîreceives criticism rather than the medium/industry as a whole.

@IveBeenTreaded @6arks Do you mean that in relation to the average multiplayer game? or all games, or something else? The amount of metrics that indicate bias to someone vary from person to person. To you there's no bias, but to OP there is. I myself wouldn't be too quick to be absolute about it.

@WithAG85 @TeenVogue The main cues of an ‚Äúemaciated‚Äù person is a gaunt face (usually makeup), but also small shoulders and lack of chest muscles (above and underneath the boobs).

2. it's a movie that involves crazy rich Asians, but it is not about them. It's about people like Rachel.	3. actual 'crazy rich Asians' didn't live as immigrants and are not the ones fighting for this type of representation. The movie's movement, quite simply, wasn't for them.
So I know a lot of Asians find Crazy Rich Asians to be classist, but here's the thing:	1. there's a diff between representing wealthy/elite POC vs acknowledging in the west that they exist. Here, it functions more as a debunker than a glamorizer, given how we've been stereotyped.

@Aries_Caidoz She is incredible in Sunshine. East Asian casting standards should just be... her.
@Aries_Caidoz Sorry, didn't know what you meant at first. But yes I can be super bitter that Godfrey Gao or someone similar hasn't been cast in anything yet and no one seems to notice.
@Aries_Caidoz Well not giving a shit about Asian representation isn't uncommon these days so thanks for your honestly at least lol.
@crimsonpostgrad It sounds better than it did several months ago when it almost got whitewashed or cast non-Chinese Asians, so I'm gonna give it a chance. I was 11 when Mulan came out so I should be in the haters category, but I'm not going to be.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

@5leeefa @kyutibu @Lazanyah Like, what do you personally consider the original Little Mermaid? What if Disney made a live action one but Ariel actually died at the end? It‚Äôd be super dark, but could be amazing.
@5leeefa @kyutibu @Lazanyah There‚Äôs more than 1 ‚Äòoriginal‚Äô though. Just because the Disney animated version was the most popular doesn‚Äôt make it ‚Äòthe‚Äô in my mind. Let the directors try something new and we might be pleasantly surprised.
@CrankyClown @thucydiplease Buy land in the NWT while you can.
@nerdyasians And it sounds like they want to imitate a wuxia movie since those are becoming more popular with westerners now. If people really want something exactly like Disney‚Äôs animated Mulan, they can just rewatch it.
@nerdyasians I think they‚Äôre just adapting from the original story instead of copying the Disney animated feature(which was already an adaptation).		That said, your tweet doesn‚Äôt want to make me see it less, but it will help to discourage others, if you want to talk about setup for failure.
@kyutibu @Lazanyah @5leeefa Decent, well cast East Asian representation is the point.

@Shes_deathProof @ajplus @MiQL I wouldn‚Äôt have a problem with mass automation if these same people were fighting for basic income, but they just want to phase out the livelihoods of people they don‚Äôt like.
@Shes_deathProof @ajplus @MiQL I hadn‚Äôt realized that before. Plus, they have enough power now that each time they fuck up, it‚Äôs an opportunity for teh boys to do more research, get even more grants, and ‚Äútest‚Äù on us more, instead of just being shut down.

@Shes_deathProof @ajplus @MiQL Lmao
@Shes_deathProof @ajplus @MiQL Plus AI is still bad at detecting the *meaning* of human expressions and emotions, esp. based on context, esp. when the whole thing centers around humans acting unpredictably. Testing the current model in a enclosed space isn't going to improve that. Rigorous training might.
@Shes_deathProof @ajplus @MiQL Er, yeah I realize that? But that's not in the current iteration of self-driving cars.	And I'm saying it IS the cars'/designers'/engineers'/regulators' fault for rolling these cars out BEFORE that feature is fully reliable.
@Shes_deathProof @ajplus @MiQL That wouldn‚Äôt properly deal with real life situations, like pedestrians making last-minute decisions, or communicating w/ the driver via casual eye contact and hand gestures.
@cnni Pedestrians are accustomed to making eye contact and hand gestures with the driver, some blurring the line between official and casual/implicit. How do self-driving cars properly account for this?

@quasives Agree. There's definitely something personal behind it. And I mean, we all have issues, but when someone takes it out on others by hurting them in broad strokes, it's just wrong.
@quasives It's funny because assimilated immigrants are already considered "white/whitewashed" and there are plenty of white people who are tolerant and nice. I get that she wants to be included/accepted, but there are so many other ways than the alt-right.
@quasives That is so unfortunate. I've also seen her facetiously coax girls who don't wear a hijab to "go put on your hijab". It's like "I have no basis for hating you, so can you give me a reason to, because you're middle eastern." Really interesting i.e. inconsistent.
@quasives Oh wait I think I misread your tweet. Maybe? I'm so sleepy and confused rn =_=
@quasives Huh?? I'm not defending her. I'm saying it's hypocritical of her to blame other immigrants for things when she does the same thing.
@quasives I read in an article months ago that she "redpilled her whole family" and that's like, you do you I guess... but this makes it so look so bad.		Also, I can only imagine how harsh she'd be about people's parents who don't speak English if they were from a Muslim-majority country.
@quasives I'm just a rando internet person, but wtf this is crazy. Are you sure neither of them speak English and it isn't just a heavy accent/timid personality?

@ikari @Ethelmonster @Nanohabro Maybe female colleagues have also just said "oh, I know this part/already knew most of this" and you're just assuming they're offended?		Considering male and female reactions are perceived differently (by men and women), it wouldn't surprise me.

@Entropy72 @cnni I simply think that saying "allegedly" once at the beginning of the article is meant to convey that meaning for everything after it. After all it's still just an article for casual readers, not a contract. Journos think of themselves as pseudo-lawyers, but not actual lawyers.
@Entropy72 @cnni Are you saying that if they use the word once, they have to use it throughout? Wouldn't that be redundant?
@Entropy72 @cnni I don't make the seemingly strange rules of journalism, I just know that they exist.
@Yaraduagroup @cnni The article wasn't aware that there was physical evidence of the tweets. I'm sure if they wrote another article that included this screenshot, they wouldn't use the word "allegedly". Make sense?
@Entropy72 @cnni My point is that the word "allegedly" doesn't make me doubt what happened and it isn't supposed to. My argument is *not* that none of those things happened--they definitely did. But journalists are not supposed to use the word definitely.
@Entropy72 @cnni B/c the tweets were deleted, there's no tangible proof. As long as there's a shred of possibility that her admission might not be true, a journalist isn't supposed to state the outcome as a fact. I've seen the word used in even stranger situations, like obvious physical assaults.
@Entropy72 @cnni That word gets used all the time. Afaik, it's the neutral language that journalists are supposed to use because they're only allowed to present things as observations.

@tabithacogitans Duly noted.
@tabithacogitans @NFormYourSelf Sorry, but fights have to be fought fairly and logically no matter how passionate you are about them or how wrong your opponents are. OP choosing a specific and misleading example is every bit as nitpicking.
@n8john84 Okay: the directors of highest grossing films are not responsible for their films grossing the highest, and should not be recognized for it at award shows.
@tabithacogitans @NFormYourSelf I agree that women are nominated far less than they should be, but OP sounds like she logically deduced that best picture automatically means best director nomination. 		It's misleading because when I first read it, I thought it was unprecedented, until I looked it up.
@tabithacogitans @NFormYourSelf It's possible to support a broad concept but call out one example for being illogical, since it can make the overall argument sound weak, which does no good for anyone. "Derailing" would've involved using his disagreement to be dismissive of inequality and oppression.

@mickusgaming @MiaCHaight @verge And "u r" a capitalist tool who believes that because they wanted you to. Like OOoomg.
@mickusgaming @MiaCHaight @verge Also, what I'd meant was that they could've released every iPhone X feature 7 years ago, but instead choose to trickle it out slowly. So tech companies are not in fact, "too fast" for people. If anything, they're artificially slow.
@mickusgaming @MiaCHaight @verge 7 years is a bit much. But I know a lot of people who update it every two years and complain about it being above their means.		And "companies...profit" isn't a good enough answer for me. It's still wasteful and selfish, no matter which company does it.
@mickusgaming @MiaCHaight @verge Lol. Being able to afford one doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt overpriced, or that we should be tossing away perfectly fine smartphones.		They had the technology to produce an iPhone X seven years ago, and the fact that you don‚Äôt see through this is exactly what they wanted.

@Raptornx01 @lvmaeparian @beaudacious @brooksbarnesNYT A naive interpretation of that stat.		It happens with most undergrad programs (even biology, and even specialized post-grad like law).

All drugstore toothbrushes look like sneakers from the 90s.
@Raptornx01 @lvmaeparian @beaudacious @brooksbarnesNYT Ha! haha! Yeah, they must be going to animation school to find a husband. 		You're just yanking my chain now, aren't you?
@Raptornx01 @lvmaeparian @beaudacious @brooksbarnesNYT There's a difference between girls not being encouraged to pursue certain crafts vs not taking interest or excelling at them (in this case, sorry, but they do).		And I thought the bro argument was that tech is men's territory. Now refined crafts are just men's too? wow.
@Raptornx01 @lvmaeparian @beaudacious @brooksbarnesNYT If you're going to fall back on "early interest" to avoid thinking about workplace discrimination, most people who decide to pursue animation-related jobs as a career are girls.		And that includes programs with low acceptance rates.
@Raptornx01 @lvmaeparian @beaudacious @brooksbarnesNYT When have I brought up race in this conversation? I'm talking about gender.
@Raptornx01 @beaudacious @brooksbarnesNYT I said most animation *students* are girls. Most people with the job position of "animator" are men, yes.
@Raptornx01 @lvmaeparian @beaudacious @brooksbarnesNYT I don't think that's how it's happening either. Discrimination is far more subtle than that.
@beaudacious @brooksbarnesNYT Well I think most of them do stay in the industry, but the men are more likely to find their way to shinier places and higher level positions, because, as you said, "I wonder".

@readingquietly Every white person here is at least partly Irish too. So they're not fake Irish pubs, but many are low effort. 		"We're a bar and everything is made of wood and it's dimly lit. We only have chicken fingers but the pub down the street has great Irish food."
@readingquietly It's where an engaged couple raises money for their wedding by having a raffle party. Totally not my thing, but it's very popular in smaller towns around here.
@readingquietly We have bars here too, lol! It's not a terminology difference so much as pseudo-Irish inspired pubs are just more preferred here on game nights.
@readingquietly It isn't blatant pressure though. And certainly not from an alt-right, ha. But it's a social pressure.
@readingquietly Really? I can't say that's my personal experience as a Canadian in Ontario. I'm expected to do the awkwardly-hold-door-for-everyone thing, hold small-talk convos with strangers, attend stag and does even though I find them tacky. These things don't happen in Shanghai.
@readingquietly I just meant the vague superficial culture. Consume mostly American entertainment, dream of owning a cottage, go to the pub to watch hockey.		Immigrants have social pressure to do those things moreso than westerners have to partake in foreign cultural daily activities.
@readingquietly Campuses are their own subculture for sure. I used to get told a lot "it seems like everyone is a liberal, but outside of here, they're not."		But returning to your sea metaphor (which I agree with), western culture has more resilience here, even if there are lots of immigrants.
@readingquietly I feel like reverse assimilation would be if you were in Hong Kong for a semester for exchange or something.		The immigrants who were around you were largely or partly assimilated into /your/ culture already, and there's still more pressure on them to be more like you.
@instantKO lmao!
@readingquietly Of course. I'd like to think most people interested in other cultures don't have ulterior motives.		Most Asian women have been approached by/fallen for a few bad apples and it's enough for us to keep our guard up. But we can also sense when someone's sincere.
@readingquietly What do you make of that, if you don't mind me asking?
@readingquietly I had to stop reading when I saw that part. But early on when she kept making unnecessary and stereotypical physical references to people ("tiny", "73 lbs", "squat"), I knew it'd be bad. Exemplary othering.
@readingquietly By this, I mean that if a westerner emigrated to the East, I would expect no less.
@readingquietly Also, there is a push for assimilation to work the other way, if you look at multicultural incentives. We love it when native westerners take interest in our culture.		We just prefer it to be done thoughtfully, as I imagine native westerners would like too for their culture.
@readingquietly The answer there is in the word immigrants, I think. I adopted Western cultures because it was a way for me to survive and get along, and it also makes people around me more comfortable.		So assimilation does work both ways, but assimilation =/= orientalism
@readingquietly Studying in depth is perfectly fine (even if it's by white men, lol)		*Sometimes* there are white men whose interest in Asian studies are motivated by lust/fetishization of Asian women, which sounds ridiculous, but it does happen. That's the only bothersome aspect I can think of.
@readingquietly @jenniferpadjemi I guess it does often involve fashion statements, yeah, because consumer culture etc etc. The other large aspect is definitely othering, which covers a lot of areas including sex.		You can check out Lena's belittling essay about Japan if you're curious.	https://t.co/7brDD2ubpH
Why doesn't Rowan Atkinson have his own food/travel show on Netflix yet.
@readingquietly @jenniferpadjemi Simply put, it's the emulating+distorting of Eastern culture and "othering" of their people and ways of life, w/o contemplation or compassion.		Modern hipster examples: joking about Asian friends being pocket sized, wearing katakana slogans on shirts without knowing the meaning.
Trump's America https://t.co/ilJ2cD8Mxi
@TeenVogue It's also pretty Orientalist to use Chinese models to "add flare". They're people with career aspirations, they're not seasoning or decoration.		But if that IS what Victoria's Secret is going to do, they could at least respect East Asian beauty standards a little bit.
@TeenVogue Wish they would consider models like Yang Mi, Arissa Cheo, Lilli Lin (to name a few).		There are so many gorgeous models on the non-western part of Instagram who will never be known here because the west has their own expectations of what it means to be beautiful if you're Asian.

@jenniferpadjemi Also, generally subtle racism from hipsters who think they get a pass because they attended a liberal arts school and therefore must be woke.		I've noticed a lot of them fall in line with Orientalist behavior too, but as long as it concerns Japanese things, it's "alright".

@elsa6bean @nowthisnews @JRoInAK Sadly it's most likely because Asians are desensitized to it. Most of us just don't talk about it often.		I must get... I'll call them "aggressive verbal comments" about being Chinese at least once a month from total strangers. Not as violent as this one, though.

@THR Asian women are grossly hypersexualized or sexually contextualized constantly, and I wouldn't be surprised if that's contributed to the noticeable lack of Asian actresses rising to prominence in Hollywood.		But yeah, continue to pretend we don't exist.

@BrettPetzer @misohawni @HelloJoburgMag Effectively hiding the fact that they're racist with pr would only perpetuate the problem long-term.		The silver lining to all this is that they've exposed themselves to be dirtbags unfit to interact with other cultures with decency.

@SenSchumer The US treats people from third world countries like slaves, if taking advantage is going to be a discussion.
@Xiaxue I don't disagree with your theory though. The "meek" thing is true, which is why most guys prefer the "no makeup look" (and are usually, actually referring to THAT). They want the best of both worlds.
@Xiaxue Perhaps that's why people like Katy Perry and Rihanna are considered beautiful even if they have bad complexions/poorly shaped eyebrows  without makeup on.		At the end of the day their bone structures and facial proportions are better and more versatile than most people's.
@Xiaxue Imho most makeup makes us prettier in the sense that we look more polished, striking, and glamorous.		But the intrinsic beauty that we note subconsciously (like bone structure, natural eye size) largely stays the same.
@Xiaxue From a psychological standpoint, I think men can subconsciously tell when makeup (most types makeup application) is responsible for attractiveness, which then signals that the attractive traits are less likely to be inheritable.

@saladinahmed @KelloggsUS This can be pretty common w/ bigger corps. They ask artists to pick a "vague" skin tone that doesn't spark debate. Obv here it didn't work.
@saladinahmed @KelloggsUS But because he's the only human in the drawing, the artist was asked by Kelloggs to make the skin darker, "more inclusive".

@KithKanan Is the point here that any appropriation taking place on American soil is automatically "white American"? If so...yea, people do think that.
