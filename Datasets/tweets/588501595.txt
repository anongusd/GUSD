Veterans are real life heroes.  They protect us, our future, and our children’s future.   No veteran should ever go hungry.  No veteran should be homeless.  What is the character of a country that allows either to occur?  6/7
I ran into Joe earlier this year (pic below). He thanked me again for what the agency did for him years ago, but I told him that providing him (and other vets) with housing was one of the most gratifying experiences of my life and I thanked HIM for his service to our country. 5/7 https://t.co/c8nUr8fQ7j
I know Joe because after he was housed he sent the agency a moving letter thanking us for helping him and for bringing him hope.  He reunited with his youngest son and began to focus on his future.  4/7
Joe received a special federal housing subsidy for homeless veterans, called the VASH voucher, and finally found stable, affordable housing.  3/7
After losing his job, Joe became despondent and ended up living on the streets in the DC region.   Joe was living in an abandoned vehicle when he was referred to the DC Housing Authority, about five years ago.  2/7
This is a story about Joe. Joe is a Vietnam vet.  After the war, Joe came home, supported his family, and enjoyed a middle class life until he loss his job.  #VeteransDay 1/7

All kidding aside, we need a comprehensive federal housing policy that seeks to strengthen the country by strengthening the availability of and access to housing for low and moderate income families. Housing is a solution, not a burden!
So.  Here we are again, on the dawn of another #SOTU.  Will this be the year that a POTUS includes #housing in his speech as a top priority? Or will this be another episode of "houser blues"?   (Or worse?!?😱)

The need for quality affordable housing is as important today as ever and "housing is infrastructure".  We must remain vigilant and never allow our national leaders to forget this.
The work that @NAHROnational members and many others do each day to preserve/create quality affordable housing, and to help families achieve their personal economic potential contributes to the vision...and the dream.
In addition to employment opportunities and better income levels for poor people of every race, the campaign also recognized the critical role of quality housing and demanded meaningful investments in affordable housing.
Dr. King in 1968:"l would remind you that in our own nation there are about 40 million people who are poverty-stricken. I have seen them here and there. I have seen them in the ghettos of the North; I have seen them in the rural areas of the South; I have seen them in Appalachia"
