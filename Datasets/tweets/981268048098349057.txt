@neilscott71 @virtuoso32 @PatNColl @RealJamesWoods Then she is a victim of her environment and it aint her fault she needs angermanagement.Forreal something is wrong with our kids she was actuslly fighting over politics it was Obama and Trump.

@TarynIvelisse @virtuoso32 @PatNColl @RealJamesWoods If he bashed her the same thing conflict resoultion talks and maybe anger management. school should be safe for all kids and kids fight and so do adults. Conflict manangement is the key. All that onesided stuff aint cool. Thats the lynch mob mentality and shows no love for kids
@TarynIvelisse @virtuoso32 @PatNColl @RealJamesWoods I feel sorry for the young man. But it something that should be dealt with counselors and conflict resoulution talks between the kids. The quick judgement is not how a teacher or adminstrator should respond. How can you help both the students equally is my only way of seeing it.
@TarynIvelisse @virtuoso32 @PatNColl @RealJamesWoods Lol I gave both perspectives actually.Hitting is wrong but its a suspendid offense and something that can be dealt with in house.if she just randomly hit him and he was quite and did not provoke her in any kind of way then you can say it was pre meditated.Or what did he say 2 her
