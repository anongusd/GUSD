Ds interested in my 2010 analogy. Point is political enviro will change, but in which direction? Trump unpredictable &amp; Ds underestimate him.
We lost PA-12 special in spring 2010. Tough loss and media said GOP was dead. Went on to win 63 seats six months later. #ThingsChange
Warning signs for both parties coming out of this race. Plenty of time to address over the next 17 months. Political enviro likely to change
Only 22 seats Rs hold that Clinton won. If Ds can't win #GA06 w/unlimited $, will be tough to run table next Nov. Not impossible but tough.

@JesseFFerguson Very kind of you. Thanks, Jesse.
Risk 4 GOP if they lose #GA06 is they try to cut ties w/POTUS. Only way to change trajectory is to produce legislative victories for Trump.
Dems are badly in need of win. A win in #GA06 would give them something to go back to their donors with and would help with recruitment.
CW is trending in Ossof's favor, but given amount of money &amp; national attention on this race, a loss would be a psychological blow to Dems.
A win for Dems in #GA06 would be a wake up call not an alarm bell for House GOP. We have a year and a half until the midterms.
Political enviro has shifted away from GOP, but also important to note white/college educated districts like #GA06 went to Hillary in 2016
Specials elections like #GA06 often raise more questions than answers and aren't necessarily predictive. With that caveat...
