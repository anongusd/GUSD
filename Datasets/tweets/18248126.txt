@fleetadmiralj on MTPs?
@fleetadmiralj are these MTPs or on passage subject to 60-vote "Silent" filibusters?
@fleetadmiralj that poll is of Wisconsin voters, to be clear. Certainly a good sign for the rust belt overall.

@fleetadmiralj if only the california delegation constituted the entire house :D
@fleetadmiralj no, 219 members voted FOR Pelosi.  the 3 present votes would have added to the 18 other votes.  Pelosi would still have an absolute majority of votes cast.
@fleetadmiralj 219 is one short of a majority of all members, present votes dropped it from 218 down to 216

@BrandonRich me too. I am resigned to the fact that my curb will have a hill on it through the winter.
@KagroX not that I wouldn't be perfectly fine with GOP committing the coup de grâce of a longstanding liberal effort to kill the filibuster
@KagroX so then that makes McConnell's 2015 argument a bit more of an empty threat then doesn't it? If dems can still filibuster the appeal.
@KagroX but if like you said they just wanted it to be over then they didn't have to resort to hauling in the VP.
@KagroX I suppose they didn't object.  I was just expecting the presiding officer to have to rule with Reid and was surprised he didn't.

@bryan_horwath again, quibble with the facts if you want, but attacking the medium doesn't cut it. What was inaccurate about his post?
@bryan_horwath And you may have great penmanship, but you need to have been somewhere for a while to know the context you're reporting in.
@bryan_horwath and as to anonymity, The Federalist Papers were all written under pseudonyms.
@bryan_horwath and I certainly don't need to be a reporter or an editor to be able to voice an opinion.
@bryan_horwath I don't have to have a newspaper to report facts.  Virtually everything Chad posts is backed up with documentation.
@bryan_horwath That's a straw man if I've ever heard of it. The content of the blog speaks for itself.
@bryan_horwath and you've been at the Dickinson Press how long?
@bryan_horwath and that the 10+ years that @northdecoder has been reporting gives him the ability to call Nick's 2 years of reporting rookie
@bryan_horwath I think you don't know who runs the oldest left-leaning blog in the state, who has always been open about his identity.
