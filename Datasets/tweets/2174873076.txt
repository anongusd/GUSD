@GavinNewsom I wanted to thank you for inspiring me and ask you to please consider me for a position with your communications team...
@GavinNewsom I plan on working as a lobbyist and in campaign communications with the goal of one day running for office myself.
@GavinNewsom I completing my MS in Public Relations and MA in International Relations at Syracuse University.
@GavinNewsom I went on to recieve a BA in Political Science and Spanish from Whittier College, now....
@GavinNewsom when I graduated from Gateway High school in 2009 you came to speak to my civics class I wondered then if you still remembered.
@GavinNewsom a year later, in 2005, at a science convention at Fort Drum or something, you did!
@GavinNewsom in 2004 the day before you were elected mayor of San Francisco we met and promised me if you saw me again, you'd remember me.
Think Plausitive!
