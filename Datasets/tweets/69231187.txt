We are disturbed by the attempts to distract from #HumanRights violations in #Kashmir. @UNHumanRights has a global mandate &amp; works independently, with an established methodology, in its reporting. This is not about politics. It’s about the rights of millions of people in Kashmir.

I appeal to you to do more, to speak louder and work harder for the common purpose and for universal #HumanRights law, to better our chances for a global peace – UN Human Rights Chief #Zeid at #HRC38	#StandUp4HumanRights https://t.co/3MarghrmwT
Only by speaking out can we begin to combat the growing menace of chauvinistic nationalism that stalks our future – @UNHumanRights Chief #Zeid at #HRC38	#StandUp4HumanRights
If my Office, of which I am very proud, and I, have gotten one thing right over the last few years, it is our understanding that only fearlessness is adequate to our task at this point in time  – @UNHumanRights Chief #Zeid at #HRC38	#StandUp4HumanRights
The @UN’s raison d’être is the protection of peace, rights, justice and social progress. – UN Human Rights Chief #Zeid at #HRC38	#StandUp4HumanRights
Chauvinistic nationalism is the polar opposite of the @UN, its very antonym and enemy. So why are we so submissive to its return? Why are we in the UN so silent?  – UN Human Rights Chief #Zeid at #HRC38	#StandUp4HumanRights
Historically, the most destructive force to imperil the world has been chauvinistic nationalism. The @UN was conceived in order to prevent its rebirth – UN Human Rights Chief #Zeid at #HRC38	#StandUp4HumanRights
The @UN is symptomatic of the wider global picture. It is only as great or as pathetic as the prevailing state of the international scene at the time -- UN Human Rights Chief #Zeid at #HRC38
Why is the Universal Declaration, and the whole body of human rights law that followed it, the object of so much attack now -- UN Human Rights Chief #Zeid at #HRC38. LIVE: https://t.co/x662CNPpVp 		#StandUp4HumanRights #UDHR70
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was negotiated by the same political leaders who poured universal values into the Charter, creating the @UN – UN Human Rights Chief #Zeid at #HRC38	#UDHR70

#السعودية: نشعر بالقلق أيضاً إزاء الاعتقال التعسفي الواضح وحالات الاختفاء لأشخاص آخرين، من دون إعطاء أي تفسير أو محاكمة واضحة وفق الأصول القانونية. ومن أحدث الأمثلة #نواف_طلال_الرشيد.
بما أنه تمَّ تخفيف القيود المفروضة على بعض أنشطة المرأة في #السعودية في الشهور الأخيرة على نحو ملحوظ، فإننا نشعر بالحيرة إزاء الأسباب التي تدفع حالياً بالسلطات إلى استهداف النساء والرجال الذين يساهمون في حشد الحملة من أجل تحقيق هذه التطورات الإيجابية.

Migrants’ collective expulsion, without individual assessment or any due process guarantees, is deeply alarming &amp; not in line with #Algeria’s obligations under international #HumanRights law.
#Algeria/migrants: Most people said that they were not subjected to individualised assessments &amp; were not informed of the reasons for their detention, nor were they allowed to pick up their belongings before they were expelled. Many had to leave behind everything they had.
A @UNHumanRights team visited Niamey, Agadez &amp; Arlit in Niger where they interviewed 25 migrants expelled from #Algeria in recent months, &amp; others familiar with the situation.
We call on #Algeria to cease collective expulsions of #migrants, particularly from sub-Saharan Africa. While exact figures are difficult to obtain, the number of people expelled is believed to run into many thousands – @UNHumanRights. READ: https://t.co/ix74C36t85 https://t.co/4Z4sXZJmHq

#Gaza: I again remind all concerned that lethal force may only be used in cases of extreme necessity, as a last resort, in response to an imminent threat of death or risk of serious injury. -UN #HumanRights Chief #Zeid
Children should never be the targets of violence &amp; must not be put at risk of violence or encouraged to participate in violence. - #Zeid on #Gaza	#ChildRights #CRC
I urge #Israel to act in accordance with its international obligations. Palestinians' right to life, their right to security of the person and rights to freedom of assembly and expression must be respected &amp; protected. - #Zeid
The occupation must end, so the people of #Palestine can be liberated, and the people of #Israel liberated from it. End the occupation, and the violence and insecurity will largely disappear. - UN Human Rights Chief #Zeid https://t.co/gna3uXn23s
UN #HumanRights CHief #Zeid on #Gaza: Those responsible for violations must in the end be held accountable. "What do you become when you shoot to kill someone who is unarmed &amp; not an immediate threat to you?"
Nobody has been made safer by the horrific events of the past week - @UNHumanRights Chief #Zeid on #Gaza
#Israel, as an occupying power under int'l law, is obligated to protect the pop. of #Gaza &amp; ensure their welfare. But they are in essence caged in a toxic slum from birth to death; deprived of dignity; dehumanised by the Israeli authorities - #Zeid https://t.co/szDXHqu2y4
Palestinians have exactly the same #HumanRights as Israelis do. The same rights to live safely in their homes, in freedom, w/ adequate &amp; essential services &amp; opportunities. &amp; of this essential core of entitlements due to every human being, they're systematically deprived. - Zeid
The stark contrast in casualties on both sides is also suggestive of a wholly disproportionate response - #Zeid on #Gaza
This was not a "PR victory for Hamas", in the reported words of a senior Israeli spokesman; it was a tragedy for thousands of families. - #Zeid https://t.co/uO2T8hdOsq
The violence reached a peak on 14 May, when 43 demonstrators were killed by Israeli forces – and the number sadly continues to climb, as some of the 1,360 demonstrators injured that day succumb to their wounds - #Zeid
Since the protests in #Gaza began on 30 March, 87 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli security forces, incl. 12 children; 29 others, incl. 3 children, were killed in other circumstances. &amp; over 12k people have been injured, more than 3,500 of them by live ammunition -#Zeid

When tech companies supply data to a State in contravention of the right to privacy under international law, they clearly risk becoming complicit in human rights abuses. #Zeid LIVE @GlobalCenters https://t.co/BK9PISB4Ju
In 2016, attacks by States on online freedom, and use of surveillance to target rights defenders, are an acute concern for our Office. In 2016, authorities in 38 countries arrested people because they published/shared social media posts. #Zeid LIVE https://t.co/BK9PISB4Ju
4.1 billion people in the world still aren't online.  Bringing them Internet access would raise 500 million people out of poverty.  The main barrier is the lack of money. We need more measures to resolve this digital deficit.  #Zeid LIVE @GlobalCenters https://t.co/BK9PISB4Ju
