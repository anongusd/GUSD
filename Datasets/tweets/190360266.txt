Area Chairman Wants Speedy, Yet Robust Debate
House Armed Services adopts its committee rules, security procedures and staff roster by voice vote.
Anthony Brown walks into Armed Services late, and heads to what he thinks is his seat before realizing Democrats now sit on the other side of the room.
Smith moves ahead with introducing the *16* new Democratic Armed Services members, which he needs a script for. "I'm going to read, word for word, something that my staff gave me," which he says he hasn't done in two decades in Congress.
Mac Thornberry, now HASC ranking member, congratulates Smith on winning the chairmanship he held for the past four years. "As the commercials used to say, you got it the old fashioned way: you earned it."
Smith says he has two overarching priorities for Armed Services:	1. maintain the committee's bipartisan tradition, and	2. get a defense authorization bill done.

"The only priority I hear from you and the report is 'more,'" Warren tells Edelman. "And that can't be an answer."
Elizabeth Warren, one of the last senators left, notes DoD still got plenty of money when the budget caps went into effect. ‚ÄúWhat have we gotten with all that money?‚Äù she asks.
Two of the three SASC Democrats who lost reelection, Nelson and Donnelly, showed up for this hearing. Both left without asking any questions.
Tim Kaine is the first SASC member to bring up the tax cuts, which add $1.5 trillion to the deficit and will likely crowd out defense spending.
I suspect we're going to hear "floor, not a ceiling" a lot from Republicans next year. So pretty much like the first half of 2016.
Edelman says French officials told the NDS panel that they have similar concerns about foreign competitors influence in their defense supply chain. He tells SASC the French have started buying out some startups with promising technology to prevent foreign takeovers.
Amb. Eric Edelman tells SASC that civilian vacancies at DoD have become "more problematic and more pronounced" in debates alongside uniform personnel.		‚ÄúThat‚Äôs created a kind of imbalance in terms of the voice being heard on national security policy,‚Äù he says.
"Disequilibrium's not a word that I use, but I'm sure it's real," Inhofe tells the witnesses while quoting their report back to them.

I can‚Äôt really stress that second point enough. Don‚Äôt  assume every Armed Services member wants to stay there. In particular, certain committees offer better fundraising opportunities.
This turnover gets amplified if Democrats take the House for a couple reasons:	1) Dems add seats to HASC, increasing the number of open seats they need to fill.	2) Some Dems might want to leave Armed Services for another committee ‚Äî like E&amp;C, Appropriations, Ways &amp; Means, etc.

And who is in leadership ‚Äî Speaker, Leader, Whip? That‚Äôs a sleeper issue.		These budget deals are ultimately negotiated by leadership, not the committees. So what Pelosi (or whoever would succeed her) is willing to give Republicans on defense matters a great deal.
And where do House and Senate Armed Services land on their final NDAA topline?		Adam Smith and Jim Inhofe don‚Äôt view the defense budget the same way. Neither has said what their number would be, but they have very different views on what is sustainable.
So if you keep things steady, match for domestic spending (which Dems will demand), we‚Äôre talking about something on the scale of the last budget deal ‚Äî $300B and mostly unpaid for.		With a projected $1 trillion deficit, that should be a good test Congress‚Äôs appetite for debt.

If the caps are allowed to return in FY20, it would be a $70+ billion cut in base defense spending from the current year. That‚Äôs just to keep the current level, not even slightly increase to adjust for inflation, which DoD likely will ask for.
Based on prior agreements, a budget caps deal likely wouldn‚Äôt happen until late 2019 at the earliest.		At some point, Adam Smith and Pete Visclosky will have to mark up their defense bills ‚Äî agreement or no ‚Äî and they‚Äôll have to pick a topline.
All of this happened in unified government where there was some bipartisan cooperation (particularly from Senate Dems on the approps bills).		If Dems take back the House, it shakes things up, because [INSERT OBVIOUS EXPLANATION].
So on budget caps, I‚Äôd start by saying I got it wrong this year. Bigly.		Never thought defense hawks would get the $700B they wanted and certainly didn‚Äôt think NDAA and appropriations would be done on time. But here we are.

This is the closest Congress has come to funding the military on time in quite a while. If appropriators can get this Defense/Labor-HHS minibus passed in the next few weeks, it'll be the first time since 2006 that DoD has been fully funded at the start of the fiscal year.
Today was a deadline for House Defense Appropriations to report any open issues with the Senate up to the full committee.		But the defense bill could very well have few open issues‚Äîor none at all. It rarely has many partisan riders, unlike other approps bills (think HHS, Energy).
The House and Senate are in session together for just 7 days in September, but appropriators are making headway on an FY19 defense bill.		The Big Four defense appropriators (Shelby, Durbin, Granger, Visclosky) met yesterday to hash out the bigger differences in their bills.

Outlining the Army's six modernization priorities, Esper pledges "they will not change." Esper, Chief of Staff Mark Milley and other Army leaders have "sworn a blood oath" to stick to that list, he says. #AspenSecurity

Q&amp;A with the first Pentagon official to appear this week at #AspenSecurity wouldn't be complete without a Space Force question. Rood mentions the interim report on space organization due to Congress in August and calls it "on track."
Asked whether Mattis might meet with his Russian counterpart, Rood says he has no announcement like that to make but "potentially in the future." He adds that meeting doesn't constitute agreement on major issues. #AspenSecurity
Rood says he has some optimism of North Korean denuclearization because Kim Jong Un is a "different leader" than his father or grandfather, employing an "economy-first" rather than "military-first" approach. He adds that he retains "a healthy skepticism" re DPRK. #AspenSecurity
Rood, who oversees DoD's POW/MIA accounting program, is asked if he thinks North Korea will live up to its pledge to return US remains. He says "we're encouraged" there could be a return of some remains "in the near future." #AspenSecurity

Asked how he feels about Putin being invited to the US, Rood calls it "a very normal thing‚Ä¶to have exchanges‚Äù between leaders. He notes that Putin visited the WH during the George W. Bush administration as well as the Crawford ranch and Kennebunkport. #AspenSecurity

I counted at least three areas ‚Äî siding with Putin over IC, meeting one-on-one with Putin, Oval Office meeting with Lavrov ‚Äî where Coats said he would‚Äôve recommended a different course of action than what Trump did.		But he hedged, too, noting presidential prerogative. https://t.co/aYBalbTJwt
