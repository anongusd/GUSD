EPILOGUE: The story highlights an unfunded flood control project in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, 10 years in the making. It ends w/ CR officials and @SenJoniErnst optimistic the Trump admin will fund it. The Corps published its fiscal 2018 work plan today. It doesn't include the project.
It's worth remembering, especially given the predictable spin that #WRDA2018 is part of a grand infrastructure package, that it's really only one piece of a complicated process to get Army Corps of Engineers projects built -- and the other pieces aren't falling into place.
There are many reasons for that and it's hard to pinpoint where the disconnect happens. At its most basic, it's about a lack of political will to spend money on projects that most everyone agrees are worthy of federal spending.
That doesn't mean #WRDA isn't important. It's a necessary step to getting projects like flood control and harbor deepening done, but it's not sufficient. Of the 64 projects authorized in the last 10 years (in 2014 and 2016 laws), 51 have received exactly $0 from the federal gov.
I have a #CQMagazine story out today. It's about how, despite the self-congratulating in Congress around #WRDA bills, the water infrastructure projects they authorize don't actually get federal funding -- which means they don't actually get built. 		https://t.co/kmm6OpxcBY https://t.co/zb79pLJdr2

@RepRodBlum Almost 10 years after a historic flood, the project has still not received any of the $73M in federal funding the 2014 law authorized. Here's Blum's take: 	3/4 https://t.co/IR8oEQeg3n
@RepRodBlum The House adopted Blum's amendment asking the Army Corps of Engineers to expedite the Cedar Rapids flood control project, which was already authorized in WRDA 2014. Then, WRDA 2016 included THE SAME PROVISION asking the Army Corps to expedite the project. 2/?
A few minutes ago, @RepRodBlum just highlighted a major shortfall in #WRDA: It's an authorization bill that doesn't actually mean projects will be funded. 1/?
One of those skipped amendments was just offered by @RepBobGibbs, who was chairman of the @Transport Subcommittee on Water Resources last Congress. Current chairman @RepGarretGraves opposes it. Gibbs withdraws.
No objection to that and the amendments are back on track.
Shuster asked for unanimous consent amendments can be considered out of order.

@tracy_mayfield @RepThomasMassie I think it boils down to: All who pay gas taxes use roads, but not all use mass transit.
@tracy_mayfield @RepThomasMassie essentially: investing gas tax revenues in roads only is most direct way to make it a true user fee.
