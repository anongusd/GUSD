@AnotherRogueAcc @WNYGeek81 @lady_cordir @KatieDid927 @DrJenGunter I find it interesting that this person hasn‚Äôt responded to anything I‚Äôve said since.
@WNYGeek81 @repulsive_cut @lady_cordir @KatieDid927 @DrJenGunter Citation, please.
@WNYGeek81 @lady_cordir @JennnnChura @dialmformolly @repulsive_cut @KatieDid927 @DrJenGunter And this has what to do with the topic at hand?
@WNYGeek81 False.
@WNYGeek81 So just for clarification, ‚Äúregular basis‚Äù means this happens regularly all over the country. Not that one sick and twisted ‚Äúdoctor‚Äù did it multiple times.  		So prove it. Go ahead.
@WNYGeek81 You REALLY didn‚Äôt understand what I said. When I said to give me evidence that this happens regularly, I wasn‚Äôt talking about the sick case that is Kermit Gosnell. I meant prove that what he did happens as a matter of course in hospitals and clinics. https://t.co/Q6mUYjEgo9
@WNYGeek81 @DrJenGunter Why wouldn‚Äôt she? Standard practice is to perform a pre-term delivery when the baby is viable, and then provide care and monitoring in NICU. If there‚Äôs a good chance the baby will die no matter what, the options are discussed with the parents. Nobody‚Äôs murdering babies. NOBODY.
@WNYGeek81 @lady_cordir @KatieDid927 @DrJenGunter Yeah, yeah, we all know about Kermit Gosnell. He was sick and disgusting. Point me to a reputable paper showing that Gosnell‚Äôs practices happen on a regular basis and maybe you‚Äôll have a leg to stand on.
@WNYGeek81 @DrJenGunter Seeing as how it‚Äôs true, why wouldn‚Äôt she want to stick by it?
@WalshFreedom Why don‚Äôt rich people just do that and be done with it instead of hoarding their millions and billions and crying about taxes they don‚Äôt pay and the gall of their workers to demand a living wage?
@WalshFreedom The baby‚Äôs quality of live must also be protected. Sometimes that means letting the parents decide NOT to prolong their baby‚Äôs suffering and postpone their death.
@SSulli84 @LisaPLDP @WalshFreedom @hannah_gianna No, we‚Äôre saying the government shouldn‚Äôt have a role here. The decision to try and save the baby‚Äôs life or make them comfortable and let them go quietly should be between the doctor and the parents.
@jordanslearned @WalshFreedom And even then they‚Äôre not always abortions. If the baby is healthy and it‚Äôs only the mother‚Äôs life and health in jeopardy, they do a pre-term delivery. Yes, you‚Äôre ending the pregnancy early, but the baby is delivered alive and sent to NICU. Nobody kills a healthy pre-term baby.
@01cathy07 @realDonaldTrump @GOP What‚Äôs ironic is jagoffs like @WalshFreedom are fine with the government interfering with a woman‚Äôs medical care and that of her unborn baby, but scream about government getting between us and our doctors whenever anyone so much as whispers ‚ÄúMedicare for all.‚Äù
@valsfunfarm @WalshFreedom Probably not, but I know people who have. Trisomy 13 is devastating and fatal, and the humane thing to do is make the baby as comfortable as possible and let them slip away quietly. Attempts to prolong their life are really just postponing death and prolonging their suffering.
@alt_4nTrade Jesus. You should be arrested amd thrown in jail for this.
@WalshFreedom Do you even CARE why someone would vote no on a bill like this? No? Then you're not pro-life. You're just pro-forced birth. And no, outlawing abortion won't stop this - it'll make it worse. Botched abortions are far more likely when abortion is ILLEGAL than when it's LEGAL.
@WalshFreedom Any medical practitioner that, AFTER TALKING TO THE PARENTS ABOUT THEIR OPTIONS, lets a baby die, does so out of the same ethics and standards that allow us to determine whether to turn the machines off or keep them on for any other person for whom we can make that decision.
@Joyjoysilva @WalshFreedom After 21 weeks...if the mother's life is in danger but the baby is viable...the hospital performs a pre-term delivery. They DO NOT kill the baby. They also DO NOT resuscitate a pre-term child only to kill it if the parents say so. The pro-forced-birth crowd MAKES ME SO ANGRY!!!!
@Joyjoysilva @WalshFreedom You know what's sickening to me? I personally know labor/delivery RNs who have performed pre-term deliveries for the very children that RWNJs claim are killed so long as abortion is legal. That's a lie. NOBODY intentionally kills ANY CHILD...OR ADULT...PERIOD.
@MattLoweDesigns @Bespoken2018 @WalshFreedom And forcing a pair of parents to pay thousands in medical bills for a child that was never, ever going to leave the hospital. A child that was going to need expensive medical care for the rest of his/her life. And so forth. They're SICK. VERY, VERY, FUCKING SICK.
@Bespoken2018 @WalshFreedom Yep, or babies who will spend their entire short lives in excruciating pain...I could name a thousand examples. The bottom line is that people like @WalshFreedom don't value life. They value BIRTH, and...well...I don't know exactly what else they value, but it isn't life.
@WalshFreedom If you TRULY cared, you would never have posted this. So fuck off, you pro-forced birth, misogynistic, greedy sonofabitch.
@WalshFreedom Do you even CARE why someone would vote no on a bill like this? No? Then you're not pro-life. You're just pro-forced birth. And no, outlawing abortion won't stop this - it'll make it worse. Botched abortions are far more likely when abortion is ILLEGAL than when it's LEGAL.

@tallygal1 Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwww *gag*

@NathalieQueen3 @Trumpet1984 @Harlan @realDonaldTrump @BetoORourke That‚Äôs not what you said, but by all means, keep moving the goalposts.
@Gg26262861 @JesseGiesbrecht @RepMattGaetz @USCG What‚Äôs going to be more effective the quickest? Dynamic, proactive measures at the ports of entry or a wall that will take years to build, giving the cartels a chance to adapt before we even have enough built to see if it‚Äôll work?

@Gg26262861 @RepMattGaetz Or do you expect me to believe that the Border Patrol is missing far more smugglers despite their growing staffing numbers? The same argument is often made about illegal border crossers - that apprehensions mean shit. They only mean shit to people like you who believe lies.
@Gg26262861 @RepMattGaetz The proof is in the difference between the field operations numbers and the Border Patrol‚Äôs numbers. Or are you too stupid to figure out simple arithmetic?

@SusanSeaside @AngrierWHStaff But since that‚Äôs not even remotely what happened, arguing the technicality is whitewashing history and people need to focus on THAT truth of what Northam said.
@SusanSeaside @AngrierWHStaff The ONLY way one could make a legit argument for differentiating the indentured Africans from the enslaved Africans enslaved is if the colony had them as indentured servants equal to the European servants for the majority, or all, of their history during the slave era. üòëüòëüòë
@PeteEarthling Yup! This is a cat that KNOWS it rules the house.
@SusanSeaside @AngrierWHStaff Then in the 1660s (I think), more slave laws were passed which just made things worse for slaves.
@SusanSeaside @AngrierWHStaff ...and just a short ten years later the colony passed its first slave laws, and those Africans were turned into slaves.
@SusanSeaside @AngrierWHStaff It has to do with the colony‚Äôs original laws. The first indentured servants were from Europe and started coming in like 1605 or 1607 I think. When Africans began arriving in 1619, they were treated as indentured servants too....

@alt_kellyanne_ @AngrierWHStaff ...but people who want to defend Northam are grabbing onto it so they can feel okay about whitewashing history...again.
@alt_kellyanne_ @AngrierWHStaff People who are quibbling are saying that the first Africans in Virginia were, in fact, indentured servants and not slaves. But that lasted a whole 10 years before they were stripped of what little freedom they had and turned into slaves. The timeline is so short it‚Äôs irrelevant..
@AngrierWHStaff Yep. And even if you acknowledge that technicality, Africans in Virginia weren‚Äôt indentured servants for very long before the colony stripped them of their freedom entirely and made them slaves. And then kept them in slavery. So let‚Äôs not quibble about the technicalities here.

@RogueUSMint Since it was written by man before and during the time of the Roman Empire, it‚Äôs easy to see why it makes no mention of either American continent. Nobody knew these continents even existed.
@RogueUSMint Word of God, INSPIRED by God but written by man and put through so many translations that it‚Äôs hard to know what the ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù Bible said. That‚Äôs another hotly debated topic among evangelicals.
@RogueUSMint It‚Äôs a literal interpretation of the Book of Revelation and it‚Äôs interesting if you can get past all the preachy parts they put in.
@RogueUSMint Ever hear of the Left Behind series by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins? Both are evangelical and their series starts with the Rapture, takes place during the Tribulation and ends with the Second Coming of Christ. It‚Äôs a fictional account of the New Testament‚Äôs end times.

@jjames321 @AltSpaceForce1 Gah! Staaaahhhhp!
@RogueUSMint Anyway, I don‚Äôt want to get into a theological debate or an argument over whether such support of Israel is right, wrong or just is. This is what I gleaned from the church I attended a million years ago regarding our ongoing, extremely staunch support for Israel.
@RogueUSMint Since Israel is the Holy Land and plays a major role in the Bible (and in the Tribulation/Second Coming), our very powerful evangelical wing is heavily supportive of Israel, to the point where any criticism at all of Israel is so blasphemous that they viscerally react to it.
@RogueUSMint The Middle East does, though, especially Israel, and Israel figures prominently in the Bible. Israel is the Holy Land. It‚Äôs where Christ will appear to render final judgment on the Earth after the Tribulation (end times, apocalypse, whatever you want to call it).
@RogueUSMint The thing is, Biblically, North America has no role in the End Times at all. We don‚Äôt appear anywhere in the Bible, and I think that scares evangelicals to death (at least, the church I once went to seemed scared to death of that).
@RogueUSMint Evangelical Christians seem desperate for the End Times to come, because they so want Jesus Christ to sweep them all up to Heaven and watch from on high as God reigns judgment after judgment on all the sinners he left behind here on Earth.

@joncoopertweets @AshaRangappa_ Personally, I‚Äôm much more likely to forgive someone for blackface in 1990 who takes full responsibility for their actions and the resulting pain and harm, and who has learned and grown since then, than I am for someone who did it in 1960 and is trying to defend or excuse it.
@joncoopertweets As an example, here‚Äôs how @MarkHerringVA responded to being called out for dressing in blackface: 		https://t.co/FZo73qSWC3
@joncoopertweets .@AshaRangappa_  had a good thread about this, too, which goes into more depth than mine does. She mentions the timeline but when you consider the more important questions, how long ago this was is far less relevant than it seems. Here‚Äôs her thread: 		https://t.co/gf3PIHYYoj
@joncoopertweets 3) This is possibly the most important item. In the case of blackface, what does the black community see from this person now? Are they willing to forgive? Do they feel this person has been making a genuine effort to be an ally since that incident? What do they think?
@joncoopertweets 2) Does their record since then indicate they‚Äôve actually learned about racism and why things like blackface are unacceptable? Can they show they understand much more now than then? Or does their history since look more like they‚Äôre repentant now only because they‚Äôve been caught?
@joncoopertweets 1) When they were called out, did they take responsibility for it? Did they acknowledge the harm their behavior caused? Do they know it was unacceptable even then?		Or are they trying to gloss over it, excuse it or defend it, including using the timeline? Is their story changing?
@joncoopertweets This isn‚Äôt as simple as how long it‚Äôs been. I will never excuse blackface any more than I will excuse rape. There are, IMO, three things to look at: 		1) How they respond to being called out for it		2) What they‚Äôve done since that time		3) How the community they harmed feels

@FeedMyLizard @R_M_Huffman @AOC @KamalaHarris @HillaryClinton @SenWarren @SenGillibrand @TeamPelosi Women are told to make him wear a condom, to be sure they‚Äôre taking their BC correctly, and above all, to avoid sex altogether if they don‚Äôt want to RISK pregnancy, because pregnancy is the ultimate punishment for a woman having sex.

@FeedMyLizard @R_M_Huffman @AOC @KamalaHarris @HillaryClinton @SenWarren @SenGillibrand @TeamPelosi I mean, sure, we talk about deadbeat dads and look down on them, but society does not police men for having sex no matter how irresponsible he is about it.

@FeedMyLizard @R_M_Huffman @AOC @KamalaHarris @HillaryClinton @SenWarren @SenGillibrand @TeamPelosi Women don‚Äôt get pregnant by crawling on top of themselves.

@shalynnchavez @PeteEarthling No, I‚Äôm telling you what the law is and how it makes your videos meaningless. Nowhere have I said how I feel about it. Don‚Äôt put words in my mouth.

@shalynnchavez @PeteEarthling And no, asylum law specifically states ‚Äúwhether or not at a designated port of arrival‚Äù and ‚Äúirrespective of such alien‚Äôs status.‚Äù Once they request asylum they do not meet the definition of unauthorized presence in the country. https://t.co/hxbcYIYYm2 https://t.co/iG0gWJhCM2
@shalynnchavez @PeteEarthling If they came in on DHS buses they didn‚Äôt cross the border illegally. They came to a port of entry and requested asylum.
@shalynnchavez @PeteEarthling Asylum-seekers. Not ‚Äúillegals.‚Äù Big difference.
@shalynnchavez @PeteEarthling Asylum-seekers do not meet the definition of unauthorized presence in the United States until their case is decided by an immigration court. That‚Äôs the truth, so now your videos are even more meaningless.
@shalynnchavez @PeteEarthling ‚ÄúBoom.‚Äù Give me a break. Asylum-seekers aren‚Äôt illegal.
@shalynnchavez @PeteEarthling So asylum-seekers. They aren‚Äôt illegal.
@shalynnchavez @PeteEarthling I am serious, yes I did watch, and that complex houses more than just a church. Nowhere in the video does anyone put forth anything other than assumptions about what they‚Äôre doing there. So the videos are meaningless.
@shalynnchavez @PeteEarthling Because there‚Äôs no context.
@CuomoCPT_515 I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre getting at.
@shalynnchavez @PeteEarthling Ohhhhhhh...are these asylum seekers? That complex has federal offices in it. If they‚Äôre asylum-seekers they aren‚Äôt illegal. 		Again, without proof or even context, these videos are meaningless.

@ReaganTrump1 @JesseGiesbrecht @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Our top marginal tax rate was 94% coming out of WWII, but averaged 90% both before and after the war, up until Lyndon Johnson, who cut it to 77%, and then Nixon cut it again to 70%. What was our economy doing for most of this?
@ReaganTrump1 @JesseGiesbrecht @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump It was under 70%.

@ReaganTrump1 @JesseGiesbrecht @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump I don‚Äôt think you read that. Or if you did, you seriously misunderstood it.
@ReaganTrump1 @JesseGiesbrecht @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump I‚Äôm not giving you all those sources again. You want to know what you‚Äôre wrong about? Scroll back.

@JesseGiesbrecht @ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump But I guess tax cuts don‚Äôt mean anything when a Democratic president does it.
@JesseGiesbrecht @ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump (And made Bush‚Äôs tax cuts permanent. That was another big contributing factor)
@ReaganTrump1 @JesseGiesbrecht @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump You do know that a big part of Obama‚Äôs deficit was making Bush‚Äôs tax cuts permanent. Are you only for tax cuts when Republicans do it?

@ReaganTrump1 @JesseGiesbrecht @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump You don‚Äôt know how old I am. And there‚Äôs no way you can know what Reagan did if you love him so much. He did a lot of stuff that the Republicans decry as ‚Äúradical left‚Äù today. History is your friend, son.
@JesseGiesbrecht @ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Because Obama did them so they can‚Äôt possibly be good.
@ReaganTrump1 @JesseGiesbrecht @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Do you? Why do you people always bring up work as though whether or not we have jobs determines whether we should see the world the way you do?
@ReaganTrump1 @JesseGiesbrecht @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump You don‚Äôt know what the Canadian or Scandinavian systems look like at all if that‚Äôs what you think.
@ReaganTrump1 @JesseGiesbrecht @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Or Denmark‚Äôs or Norway‚Äôs. You ever take a look at their systems? Or Germany‚Äôs? Maybe you should before you spout off again.
@ReaganTrump1 @JesseGiesbrecht @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs laughable that you idolize Reagan when you clearly have no clue what he did while he was in office.
@ReaganTrump1 @JesseGiesbrecht @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Over eight years. Trump‚Äôs deficit is projected to accelerate and ultimately far outpace Obama‚Äôs.

@ReaganTrump1 @JesseGiesbrecht @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Oh so NOW you‚Äôre all about the drug seizure statistics. Okay. 		That‚Äôs still a source I gave you, to which you complained that apprehensions and seizures are pretty much meaningless because, oh god, WE DON‚ÄôT KNOW WHAT‚ÄôS NOT GETTING CAUGHT. 		Don‚Äôt backpedal.

@JesseGiesbrecht @ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Actually it does...there‚Äôs a drop-down near the bottom for drug seizures. 		And that‚Äôs a source *I* gave him and suddenly he‚Äôs all ‚Äúthe seizures mean you‚Äôre wrong,‚Äù while earlier he was claiming that those same statistics don‚Äôt prove anything. How disingenuous can someone get?
@JesseGiesbrecht @ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Correct, yes. The number was higher under Obama...can‚Äôt imagine why.
@ReaganTrump1 @JesseGiesbrecht @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Two problems: 1) Our asylum law requires an applicant to be within our physical land borders to request asylum. 2) We can‚Äôt just rewrite the law to require asylum seekers to apply from their own nations. We need inter-governmental cooperation with those countries.
@ReaganTrump1 @JesseGiesbrecht @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Fix the system. Given how the situation has changed over the last 15 years, a wall is no longer a cost-effective part of any immigration plan. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm against - wasting money on a wall that could be better used in real immigration reform and border security.
@ReaganTrump1 False. If the Republicans didn‚Äôt want cheap labor, they wouldn‚Äôt have changed the tax code under Reagan to incentivize offshoring. Democrats want a living wage. It‚Äôs Republicans who whine about wages getting too high for business here.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump I suppose you believe that we should bring back the 18th Amendment as well, since everyone is drunk all the time...oh wait.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump False. Legalizing marijuana has been shown to reduce crime along the border states and put a dent in the cartels‚Äô drug market here. Since marijuana is by far the drug most often seized, legalizing it would eliminate one of their biggest markets here.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump False. I‚Äôm not conflating a damned thing. I‚Äôm proving I know how to read and interpret statistics, whereas you‚Äôre flailing around for reasons to discredit the data because it doesn‚Äôt support your narrative.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump False. Also keep in mind that we have physical barriers where they‚Äôve always needed to be, which is why those work. But here‚Äôs some truth about Israel: https://t.co/D7UQD02yXN

@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Almost entirely marijuana that we could end very easily just by legalizing it nationwide. The hard drugs are too heavy to smuggle in profitable quantities outside of ports of entry. That‚Äôs why they go to the ports of entry, the shipping ports and the mail branches.
Good. https://t.co/AvvsuYn5y7
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump And you tell me what that has to do with the wall when you just contradicted your own talking point on that.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump As Nina said, they bring them in that way because it‚Äôs their greatest chance of success. And she correctly pointed out that they come in through ALL ports of entry, not just the ones at the southern border.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump So you think Trump‚Äôs administration is inflating or otherwise manipulating statistics? Why would they? If there‚Äôs a border crisis, why would they manipulate statistics to show otherwise?
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Answer my question. Where are you getting the 22+ million? What‚Äôs your source? Because the commonly known and understood number is between 11 and 12 million. So give me your source.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump How do you not know any of this? A lot of this is common understanding of how things work.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs also called the medical examination that always occurs when someone dies of a drug overdose.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs called autopsies.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Where are you getting the 22 million? You keep beating that number like it‚Äôs written in stone and I have yet to find a source that cites that number as a fact.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Not as many as you are. At least the data supports my extrapolations. You don‚Äôt like the fact that the data doesn‚Äôt say what you want, so you claim it‚Äôs meaningless.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Um. You do know the Census bureau works on population studies outside of the big decennial censes, right? They don‚Äôt just come out of the woodwork once every ten years to do the big census.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump You don‚Äôt know how statistics work, do you?
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs not 22 million and a wall isn‚Äôt going to address enough of the problem to be worth the billions you want to spend.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Because your source, that I actually looked at, literally says they didn‚Äôt. It LITERALLY says it.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump He didn‚Äôt. Neither did the Flores decision and George W. and Obama had a policy of keeping children with their parents whenever and wherever possible, in accordance with the Flores decision.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump I don‚Äôt think she has and I haven‚Äôt either. I DO know that former cartel members are saying they conceal hard drugs for smuggling through ports of entry.

@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Not really when you look at the whole picture.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Declines in apprehensions at the border indicate declines in the number of people trying to cross it illegally. Since the number of officers at ports of entry and in the Border Patrol have significantly increased over the same time, you can extrapolate a decline in crossings.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump No, but they can estimate and they do using census data on foreign born people in the U.S., along with the census counts on native-born Americans and our total population. The discrepancy is the estimate of our undocumented population.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump You cited all overdose deaths and gave me a link where a report breaks it down. The cartels didn‚Äôt cause anywhere CLOSE to 73,0000 overdose deaths. Also, you failed to specify overdoses. And you have the gall to accuse US of mischaracterization? DUDE. https://t.co/pg25qhH0h9
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump When you use the word ‚Äúapprehensions‚Äù to describe your numbers, and the government uses apprehensions to describe the situation (which they do), then no, it‚Äôs not a mischaracterization.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Answer my question. If all we have is apprehension rates, WHICH SHE LITERALLY STATED, then how do you know the number getting through is such a problem? Especially considering that the majority are visa overstays and an even larger majority have been here for years, even decades?
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump I know the answers already and I know you‚Äôre out of your gourd with these numbers. But I want to see where you‚Äôre getting them or if you‚Äôre pulling them out your ass like I‚Äôm prtty sure you are.

@mitchellvii MS13 is a homegrown gang. They probably would have grown and evolved the same way. As for rape and murder? You aren‚Äôt serious. A wall wouldn‚Äôt have, and will not, make a difference since thr vast, VAST majority of those crimes are committed are by U.S. citizens.
@mitchellvii The same. Traffickers and the cartels aren‚Äôt stupid. They‚Äôre very good at adapting to what we do to try and stop them. They‚Äôd have long since rendered the wall useless. As for undocumented immigrants, the majority today are visa overstays. We‚Äôd just have more visa overstays.

@JHawkin05 @mcmnadal @MollyJongFast It‚Äôs not pennies when you know how they get in here and how a wall won‚Äôt change that.
@JHawkin05 @mcmnadal @MollyJongFast Since they primarily come in on visas and then never leave, a physical barrier is going to cost more than it will ever save us.
@JHawkin05 @mcmnadal @MollyJongFast Traffickers tend to come through the legal ports of entry as well, and not just at the land borders.
@JHawkin05 @mcmnadal @MollyJongFast We have walls where they need to be. More wall isn‚Äôt going to even remotely address the remaining problem. Walls work up to a point and we‚Äôre at that point here. We need to be looking at other options, not more wall.
@mcmnadal @JHawkin05 @MollyJongFast This is true. Members of the cartels themselves say they get drugs through primarily at ports of entry now through artful concealment.
@heathcat30 @alt_localgov Possibly, which both scares and infuriates me.
@realDonaldTrump False. But keep deluding yourself. We all know how far that‚Äôs getting you.
@RepMattGaetz Seeing as how the caravans tend to come to ports of entry to request asylum, your whole point is irrelevant. 		BTW, nobody is saying we‚Äôll be LESS safe. They‚Äôre correctly pointing out that we won‚Äôt be any MORE safe, which makes the wall a waste of time and money.

@urasillylibby @riotsquirl @AltNatSecAgency You're upset because we're calling you and those boys what you all are. Racists.
@urasillylibby @LurkerinAmerica @AltNatSecAgency And yes, calling racist white boys racist is acceptable. And no, he didn't lie about those kids. I watched the whole hour+ video.
@urasillylibby @LurkerinAmerica @AltNatSecAgency The people who wear those hats hold ideologies similar to Nazis and the KKK. Swastikas and white hoods are racist apparel and now so are those hats. As long as any kind of apparel is worn in support of those ideals, it will be racist.
@urasillylibby @riotsquirl @AltNatSecAgency Calling them "Indians" is racist no matter what. Racism is racism.

@KimmGlass Who's been passing the spending bills? Tell me who's been passing the spending bills and who's done squat on appropriations. Go ahead. Tell me.
@KimmGlass Trump himself only meets with Republicans and right-leaning groups despite needing to reach common ground with the Democrats. He could keep trying on that front and he won't. I mean, really, you think Trump and the Republicans are doing the work here?
@KimmGlass The House. They've been passing clean spending bills since Jan. 3. McConnell wouldn't even take them up despite the fact that he could be working to find enough votes for a veto-proof majority or an override should Trump veto it.

Short thread on "essential" and "non-essential" employees: https://t.co/SYbLdbfwYl
@JonPulsipher @platossidekick @realDonaldTrump Oh, and one other thing @JonPulsipher: If non-essential meant unnecessary, why is the administration ordering more and more "non-essential" personnel back to work without pay? Could it be that they're...gasp...NECESSARY to the function of the country???
@JonPulsipher @platossidekick @realDonaldTrump So, @JonPulsipher, I suggest you learn what "non-essential" means before you open your trap again. Because it doesn't mean "unnecessary."
@JonPulsipher @platossidekick @realDonaldTrump FBI and the courts are essential functions but they have a lot of non-essential personnel who have been furloughed, which is making it tougher for them to do their jobs. Same with other agencies that are "essential;" they have important support personnel who have been furloughed.
@JonPulsipher @platossidekick @realDonaldTrump In fact, we're watching this in slow-motion now. Each day that goes by without a deal is a day that's harder for the FBI to do its work, for the NTSB to do its work, for the judicial system to do its work (including immigration cases. You want people deported? We need the courts)
@JonPulsipher @platossidekick @realDonaldTrump The number of people who think "non-essential" means "unnecessary" is astonishing. Non-essential means not essential to the immediate safety and security of the country, not "unnecessary." Fire them all and watch how quickly the entire country grinds to a halt.
@nipperdawg Good to hear!
@nipperdawg I don't know for sure, but I don't think there's anything legally requiring any party to hold a primary. My problem with it is that canceling primaries takes away the voter's choice. The GOP doesn't care though; their authoritarian tendencies are getting worse.

@elhuetete @marcorubio "Unusual and provocative" does not = "bad." There are times when "unusual and provocative" means "good." I'm annoyed at Rubio's assumption that the words mean "bad" and his implication that the L.A. Times supports Maduro because they used those words. Okay?
@dc_lowe @marcorubio Who, me? Where did I say it wasn't?
@marcorubio Furthermore, nowhere in the article does it say this is a bad move. Why do you assume that "unusual and provocative" means "bad?" Because it's the L.A. Times? A.K.A. mainstream media?
@marcorubio It's not ridiculous. It IS unusual and provocative. The fact that other countries have taken the same step doesn't mean it isn't unusual and provocative.

@AZ_TNO @SentinelJust @MatthewJLavelle @AltNatSecAgency @jjmacnab Absolutely I do. 		I think we should end shutdowns by sending every member of an agency whose funding lapsed home. Including its senior staff and department secretary. Shut it down, furlough EVERYONE, and watch how many more times we shut down any part of the government.
@AZ_TNO @SentinelJust @MatthewJLavelle @AltNatSecAgency @jjmacnab So you‚Äôre fine with Trump acting like a dictator. Hypocrite, much?
It would also require setting up processing centers, for which I‚Äôm pretty sure we need agreements. There‚Äôs a reason we have a designated safe country agreement with Canada and not Mexico. We successfully negotiated one with Canada and not Mexico.
@AltNatSecAgency @AZ_TNO @SentinelJust @MatthewJLavelle @jjmacnab Pretty much.
So unless they're doing something I'm currently unaware of on that front, then on the surface, it looks to me like they're trying to tell other countries what we will and will not do AND what they will and will not allow. How low we've sunk.
We don't have the right to tell any country, "Hey, people are going to be coming to your country to apply for asylum here. And possibly there." We don't get to designate other countries as safe countries, pass-through countries, whatever, without their say so. 4/
And I don't understand why anybody in the government would think it is. We're looking at a potentially very long and difficult process to establish that kind of agreement with Central American countries, who are going to want things from us in return. 3/
I don't see how we get any of this to work without agreements with those countries over it. We don't have the right to just designate a foreign country a place to apply for asylum to the U.S. So this very likely isn't nearly as simple as changing our asylum law. 2/
I have not yet had the chance to read the Senate's new 1300 page bill. However, I did read somewhere that it would use the U.N.'s refugee criteria to determine who to grant asylum to and that it would require people to apply in their own countries or a designated neighbor. 1/

It‚Äôll make him look like the frightened, insecure, and inadequate little man he is. There‚Äôs a study showing that male support for Trump is linked to fragile masculinity. His use of the word ‚Äúbeta‚Äù proves what he is.
@SentinelJust @AZ_TNO @MatthewJLavelle @AltNatSecAgency @jjmacnab It‚Äôs also the right that overwhelmingly sticks to rigid and outdated ideas of masculinity, which have given rise to the incel and MRA movement. That‚Äôs a big reason why their idea of masculinity is toxic. As women become more empowered, the right feels more threatened.

@SentinelJust @AZ_TNO @MatthewJLavelle @AltNatSecAgency @jjmacnab FAR more in common, such as slut-shaming and body-shaming women, the faux persecution complex, refusing to accept any form of equality for women...all of this is far more in line with right-wing ideology.

@JohnBalley1 @AOC Except I'm not talking about socialism (and socialism and communism are not the same thing). I'm talking about the type of tax system we used to have here in the States that incentivized even big business to invest in itself and its workforce.
@JohnBalley1 @AOC And there's the problem. Here in the U.S., wealth goes upward, not downward, in large part because low taxes doesn't incentivize anyone to invest in their companies and workforces. It incentivizes them to hoard their money. And everyday people suffer for it.

@cruisegrl71 @altjellyroller @SecNielsen @DHSgov Don't confuse the request with the decision. They're two separate things. The truth is that most will ultimately be denied. But until that decision is made, they don't meet the definition of unauthorized presence in the U.S.
@cruisegrl71 @altjellyroller @SecNielsen @DHSgov So lobby to change our asylum law. Right now, this is the law.

@AZ_TNO @SentinelJust @marianan @_Orwell @alt_localgov @AltNatSecAgency You're the one promoting revisionist history, not us. In fact, that's what the entire right-wing movement in America does. Promote revisionist history that makes white people more comfortable about our dark and bloody past.
@AZ_TNO @SentinelJust @marianan @_Orwell @alt_localgov @AltNatSecAgency But you yourself acknowledge the Supreme Court's primary mission every single time you bring up Dred Scott. The Constitution implicitly granted a legal right to own slaves. And as I said before, the word "implicit" is important. You'd do well to learn that.
@AZ_TNO @SentinelJust @marianan @_Orwell @alt_localgov @AltNatSecAgency Um. The Supreme Court's whole job is to interpret the Constitution and the Constitutionality of any laws made by lawmakers. We can argue till the cows come home about whether said interpretations are good or bad, and Dred Scott isn't the only bad SCOTUS decision on the books.

@_Orwell @AZ_TNO @SentinelJust @alt_localgov @AltNatSecAgency @marianan To him and those who don't want to understand our history because it's too uncomfortable, there's no difference between the Constitution implicitly maintaining a legal right to own slaves, and calling the Constitution pro-slavery and racist.
@AZ_TNO @SentinelJust @alt_localgov @AltNatSecAgency @_Orwell @marianan Basically, I was commenting on the fact that you don‚Äôt seem to understand your own source.

@AZ_TNO @SentinelJust @alt_localgov @AltNatSecAgency @_Orwell @marianan The Heritage Foundation is neither unbiased nor non-partisan, which suggests you‚Äôre unable or unwilling to do actual research and find actual scholarly work on this.
@GayannaG @senatemajldr When people understand that a majority of undocumented immigrants are visa overstays, and that drugs and human trafficking mostly come in through ports of entry, then they should understand that a wall is a waste of money.

@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda Seeing as how white people have different lived experiences than non-white people, in this case, saying POC is perfectly relevant because you dismiss their lived experiences by claiming colorblindness.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda Now you‚Äôre just being a full-on racist.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda I assume you saw everyone‚Äôs scores as well as how all the scores broke down and therefore KNOW that any POC who outscored you and other white people only did so because of that ‚Äúadvantage.‚Äù LOL I‚Äôve been through the process, too. They don‚Äôt publish everyone‚Äôs info like that.
@N0__S0ul @jayreeder15 @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda I‚Äôm waiting to hear something about how POC just need to learn how to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, like white people do. And maybe a story or link or something opining about how the problem is with POC and not the institutions white people have created.
@HumboldtBunny But that‚Äôs...that‚Äôs...oh I can barely say it...AMNESTY. The horror! The sheer and absolute horror.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda So interpret them logically and demonstrate your logic.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda Yes, a little bit, because systemic racism is still very much a problem. It‚Äôs just a lot more subtle, and therefore, much more insidious, than it was back when racism was okay.
@jayreeder15 @AltNatSecAgency @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda So? That means nothing. I could say there are lots of people who disagree that the Earth is round. Doesn‚Äôt make it true.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda Nobody ‚Äúgave‚Äù me a filter. Nobody taught me to interpet statistics any one specific way. I did have to take statistics courses in college but they were straight math courses, not sociology courses. What other way is there to interpret these stats?
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda I didn‚Äôt say that only white people have opportunity. I didn‚Äôt even come close to that. The statistics I gave you indicate that equality of opportunity is still sorely lacking, meaning not everyone has equal access. That‚Äôs a far cry from ‚Äúonly white people have opportunity.‚Äù
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda When you say that you don‚Äôt care about race or class, you‚Äôre dismissing the lived experiences of entire segments of our population.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda To sum it up, you‚Äôre looking at specific instances of people of color succeeding and not at overall trends. Is it better than it was 60 years ago? A little. But the lived experiences of people of color are vastly different from the lived experiences of white people.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda I wouldn‚Äôt expect a majority-black police force in a majority-white town, for instance. If the town‚Äôs black population is, say, 30%, then a police force that‚Äôs 95% white could be said to be a problem.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda It should be noted that a police force that fairly represents the demographics of the areas they serve will vary from locale to locale.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda People of color in general, not just black people, made up just 27% of local police departments across the U.S. in 2013. That was a whopping 12% increase from 1987, so I doubt it‚Äôs changed significantly in the last six years.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda White people, specifically white men, overwhelmingly hold the power here. White men make up around 30% of our population, but 76% of all elected GOP officials and 55% of all elected Democratic officials are white men. They make up roughly 70% of large-company senior executives.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda Maybe, but it‚Äôs true.

@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda Finally, there are all the women who come here WITH the ability to live independently, including paying all their own medical expenses, and have babies. We‚Äôve seen a sharp rise in women from Russia doing this. And there isn‚Äôt a damned thing we can do about it.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda So coming here and having babies isn‚Äôt an especially good way to ensure legal immigration later, nor does it guarantee we‚Äôll let you stay here.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda Also, there‚Äôs nothing that stops us from deporting the parents of a child born here. All we do is try to ensure the child has someone legally present to raise them, or we put them into the system. They can‚Äôt sponsor relatives for immigration until they‚Äôre 21.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda It‚Äôs not illegal to come here and have a baby. We do try to reduce it by denying entry to women who appear to be coming here to have babies without any way to pay the expenses they incur. But we can‚Äôt stop it without ending jus soli, which means amending the Constitution.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda To end jus soli and therefore end birth tourism, or as you put it, ‚Äúanchor babies,‚Äù you have to amend the Constitution. Jus soli is codified in the 14th Amendment. And as such, any baby born on American soil, whether to an undocumented immigrant or not, is a U.S. citizen.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda By all means, prove me wrong.

@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda Those that get caught DO get sent back over the border unless they request asylum. If they do that, all the arresting authority can do is assign them a case and wait until it‚Äôs decided. Until said case is decided, they don‚Äôt meet the definition of unauthorized presence.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda If you want to end jus soli, you‚Äôll have to amend the Constitution. There‚Äôs no other way to end jus soli.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda Sorry, but many ‚Äúanchor babies‚Äù are born to women who enter the U.S. on visas when they‚Äôre pregnant. Others are born to people who are here on work visas, student visas, or other long-term visas. Very few are born to women who illegally cross the southern border.

@Mafooli @jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda And when we don‚Äôt learn from it, we repeat it.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda We also have border apprehension numbers to go by, along with other information.

@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda There are penalties for overstaying a visa, but we can‚Äôt apply and enforce them until the next time that person tries to enter the U.S., or unless they‚Äôre caught some other way.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda Once they enter on a visa, we have them in the system, along with the dates at which they are supposed to exit.

@jayreeder15 @Mafooli @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda You don‚Äôt get to say anything about sounding intelligent when it‚Äôs clear you haven‚Äôt yet read any of the links I sent you.

@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda No. The uptick from other regions doesn‚Äôt make a wall a feasible plan, especially since illegal entries over the southern border have been steadily declining for the last 15 years.

@N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @jayreeder15 @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda In theory, it would be much harder to evade drones and other electronic surveillance, cheaper and quicker to install and maintain, and easier to hire personnel for since at least some of the work could be done remotely.

@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda Yes, as in they have visas, other paperwork as necessary, and they‚Äôre cleared for entry into the U.S. That is true for drug smugglers, human traffickers, and undocumented immigrants.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda Nope, and I‚Äôm going to have to ask you for citations on that.

@AZ_TNO @marianan @_Orwell @alt_localgov @AltNatSecAgency Try to keep up. 1: What exactly do YOU think the government regulates if it‚Äôs not the behavior of the populace?

@AZ_TNO @alt_localgov @marianan @SentinelJust @AltNatSecAgency @_Orwell Could it be that (gasp) the reason why it took an amendment to ban all liquor meant that lack of mention at all in the Constitution implicitly grants a right?

I'm done playing nice with you jackasses and I have no more patience to pretend otherwise. I'm not playing nice with you anymore. Don't like it? Block me. Offended? Suck it up, buttercup, or fuck off.
You're sick. You pathetic. You want us to stop looking at you and talking about you with disdain? Then stop giving us reasons to do so, like believing every slimy word that issues from Trump's disgusting mouth. He's not one of you, but you're too willfully stupid to see that.
And you blindly follow him, and wonder why we "liberal elitists" look down our noses at you. It's because you can't even be bothered to try and learn. It's because you moan about being this horribly persecuted class as though your demographics DON'T hold most of the power here.
@brewsandbats For those on a pay schedule that overlapped the shutdown deadline, yes. Not every federal worker is on the same pay schedule though, so some were shorted, but others weren't.
You think Trump cares about you? Don't make me laugh. He cares about himself and nobody else. Including you. Jobs aren't coming back. His trade wars are driving prices up. Your wages are stagnant and your tax refund will probably be smaller this year.
I have had it with you whiny shits. I'm done with your willful ignorance. And I'm sick of hearing about how the liberal elitists look down on you and alienate you. There are more so-called "liberal elitists" than there are of you, and it's time for you to put up and shut up.
You support the most morally bankrupt man on the planet because he caters to your basest fears and instincts. You don't support Americans. You don't support America. You have no moral compass and it's time for you to stop pretending you do.
Dear #MAGAshits:	I'm not playing nice with you anymore. Many employees affected by the shutdown were shorted on the last paycheck they received. All have now missed a full paycheck. Thousands are about to miss a second paycheck. And it's your fault, you stupid fucking hypocrites.

@Vayhi ...and that things will be a million times worse because we won‚Äôt have the manpower to do anything. The whole country would grind to a halt. But since Trump‚Äôs favorite pundits equate the federal workforce to the gov‚Äôt‚Äôs size, yeah. He probably thinks he‚Äôs ‚Äúdraining the swamp.‚Äù

@OutOfTheBlue201 @AddieHillman1 @realDonaldTrump No on both points. They can request asylum each time they come, but the first denial makes it much harder to ever get an approval on subsequent requests. 		International law only requires Mexico to offer asylum, which they did. There is nothing requiring migrants to accept it.
@YouTweaked @realDonaldTrump And most of our visa overstays come from countries to which the travel ban did not apply, so again, what does that have to do with anything?

@YouTweaked @realDonaldTrump The travel bans have nothing to do with the caravans since the caravans aren‚Äôt coming from countries to which that ban ever applied.
@OutOfTheBlue201 @realDonaldTrump Oh? Do explain, and show your work.
@YouTweaked @realDonaldTrump And that has what to do with border crossings and asylum?
@OutOfTheBlue201 @AddieHillman1 @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs worth noting, though, that the language of 8 U.S.C. 1158 makes it so the request for asylum trumps our definition of illegal entry. https://t.co/K6kgJh1Pbb
@dinodlz @DonaldJTrumpJr No. Well, I had Taco Bell for dinner but no alcohol at all. Maybe the Taco Bell caused it?
@YouTweaked @realDonaldTrump Most come in perfectly legally on legit visas and disappear. Less than 30% come across the border illegally. Furthermore, illegal border crossings have dropped 90% since 2000. The number spiked in 2005, and has been falling steeply and fairly steadily since then.

@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht Amazing. Every word you just said is wrong.
@altCourierSix Oi.
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht Okay then, if I‚Äôm wrong you tell me the process. The whole process from start to finish.
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht When you ask for asylum they take you to get your case going. You get assigned an asylum officer (from USCIS, not CPB, ICE or Border Patrol) who evaluates your case and presents it to immigration court for a decision. CBP, ICE and B0 don‚Äôt have the authority to deny your request.
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht You have no clue what you‚Äôre talking about. Not one clue.
@jimsciutto @StormResist His base.
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht Nope. What I said is how it works. Any officer who does otherwise is breaking the law and subject to disciplinary action.
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht And people who are denied entry to the U.S. who don‚Äôt want to go home can request asylum, at which point CBP‚Äôs hands are tied and all they can do is get the paperwork for their case going and send them to whatever facility that particular port uses. That‚Äôs literally how it works.
@altCourierSix Someone I know elsewhere is saying Trump made a specific and special request to allow photos with several servicemembers. Have you heard anything like that?
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht That literally happens to no one unless officers are breaking the law.
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht No, it cannot. It may only be a few days, but no. You cannot be denied immediately.
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht You‚Äôre confusing the request with the decision. In practice, those are two separate things. Nobody who requests asylum is denied on the spot. They may be denied within 6-12 days, but not on the spot. An officer breaks the law by denying an asylum request on the spot.

@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht Keep in mind we're talking about the request, not the decision.
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht Not followed by whom? "Whether or not at a designated port of arrival, irrespective of such alien's status," means regardless of where and how they came in, regardless of where and how they requested asylum, and regardless of whether they're here legally or not. https://t.co/6ROVdmliEu

@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht Those new laws are EOs, not laws, and have been blocked. So 8 U.S.C 1158 stands.
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht At which point they're given a case and a court date and do not meet the definition of unauthorized presence in the U.S. until their case is decided.
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht I never bitched about anything. I was expressing confusion over a video that purports to show Trump saying the border wall is a gift to the Coast Guard, when the wall has zilch to do with the Coast Guard. You put words in my mouth from the beginning.
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht That's not merely interpretation of the law. It's literally what 8 U.S.C. 1158 says. You get picked up by ICE somewhere and you request asylum? Their hands are tied at that point. You get denied entry to the U.S. and request asylum to avoid getting sent home? CBP's hands are tied
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht If you're granted asylum, you get to stay. If you're denied, you get ordered removed from the U.S. But, per 8 U.S.C. 1158, between the time you get assigned a case and the time your case is decided, you do not meet the definition of unauthorized presence in the country.
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht You confuse the request with the grant. You can request asylum anywhere within our physical land borders. Once you request it, you are given a case and a court date and you do not meet the definition of unauthorized presence in the country until your case is decided.
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht The Democrats don't have a plan. What the hell makes you think I'm a Democrat? The fact that you don't like what I say means I'm a Dem and I blindly follow them and love everything they do? You lost that one, buddy. They have no plan and that pisses me off.
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht Answer #4: https://t.co/kduhnRslsj
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht I've answered the only question on this thread twice. Here's a third: https://t.co/xXHDPZ4tgM
@QuestioningMor1 @HangNeal Better than you, apparently. The only thing the wall has to do with the Coast Guard is the possibility that more people will try to enter the U.S. via the Gulf, making their job more difficult, not easier.
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht Wrong. Anywhere within our physical land borders means they can do it at the airports, they can turn themselves into ICE, CBP or the Border Patrol at any station they like, and they can cross the border anywhere and still request asylum as soon as they encounter authorities.
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht I'm guessing you have no idea how to read a Twitter thread. You asked where Comey entered the conversation, as though it wasn't you who brought him in.
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht And once more, literally nobody was talking about immigration here until you said something.
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht Yeah I've twice posted a screencap of where Comey entered the conversation. Want me to post it a third time?

@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht Literally nobody said anything on either of these threads on which you're creeping me about border security. You're asking questions about things nobody has said to you.
@IsobelCarr And, since DHS technically no money and is technically not operating, there's no money for any new contracts for wall construction or anything else under that department's purview.
@IsobelCarr Essential personnel must continue to work during a shutdown, but they work without knowing when they'll next be paid.
@IsobelCarr Actually, there is an awful lot of DHS that's furloughed. That includes HR, so people who were planning to retire on Dec. 31st will have to keep working until DHS is funded again because there are no HR personnel to handle their final paperwork and paychecks.

The passage of the Civil Rights Act was the final straw for the last remaining racist holdouts in the Democratic Party.

@jcpowell1285 @AltWASONPS @judahariel @realDonaldTrump @POTUS History has proven time and again that progressivism eventually wins. Pick up a history book and read every once in awhile.

@bobeck_candice @john_prokop @realDonaldTrump BTW...next time you start a tweet with ‚Äúfact check,‚Äù it would serve you well to have a citation to accompany your ‚Äúfact check.‚Äù
@bobeck_candice @john_prokop @realDonaldTrump No he didn‚Äôt. It was their money to begin with and we were holding it as part of the sanctions we had on them. If I‚Äôm holding $10 of yours and I give it back to you, did I give you your money or did I pay you $10 of mine?

@jcpowell1285 @judahariel @realDonaldTrump @POTUS ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not done yet.‚Äù Ah, the old standby when someone can‚Äôt give a real answer a question. The problem is that doesn‚Äôt add up, seeing as how he‚Äôs given Congress 3 months to fund the wall already. 3 months isn‚Äôt enough time for the master dealmaker to make a deal for some money?
@jcpowell1285 @judahariel @realDonaldTrump @POTUS ‚ÄúTrump will if they don‚Äôt.‚Äù Well, they didn‚Äôt, so why didn‚Äôt he instead of shutting down DHS and screaming about Democrats not playing ball?
@jcpowell1285 @judahariel @realDonaldTrump @POTUS You‚Äôre still not answering anything I‚Äôve asked. I never said anything about our immigration policy and certainly not about any EOs. I asked why Trump didn‚Äôt just bypass Congress and have DoD start on the wall when it became clear Congress wasn‚Äôt going to do its job. Answer that.
@jcpowell1285 @judahariel @realDonaldTrump @POTUS If he can just bypass Congress because they won‚Äôt do their jobs, why didn‚Äôt he?
@jcpowell1285 @judahariel @realDonaldTrump @POTUS That doesn‚Äôt answer my questions. Yes he said that. So? Why didn‚Äôt he just do it, then, and avoid this whole mess altogether? Why shut down DHS if he can just have the military build the wall?
@jcpowell1285 @judahariel @realDonaldTrump How impressive. üôÑüôÑüôÑ That‚Äôs indicative of nothing except your own ego. Answer my questions.
@jcpowell1285 @judahariel @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Also, why did CBP award two contracts with the ACoE in November if this is a DoD thing?
@jcpowell1285 @judahariel @realDonaldTrump @POTUS And I asked if you read what I said because I literally said that DoD had already gotten its FY2019 funding.
