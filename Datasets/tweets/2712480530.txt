@McCombDoug @boblatta You can look at real numbers from the BLS and realize that the when the bill comes due the tax cuts will be a disaster.  Especially since the majority of the benefit doesn't go to small businesses or low to mid income households.  The truth is there if you could bother.
@McCombDoug @boblatta Ok, so your excuse is that he is a shit rep because he has shit constituents?  I guess that works.
@McCombDoug @boblatta You can't judge the tax bill without comparing the growth to the deficit lol.  You really haven't thought this through.
@McCombDoug @boblatta That's pretty weak.  And most likely you are making it up as most small businesses are S-Corps so the income flows to their personal tax returns anyway.
@McCombDoug @boblatta Then why list it as a reason you support Latta?
@McCombDoug @boblatta Fair enough, but I'm not really sure you read anything.  Still gotta respond to the economy questions.  Your delay makes me think you have no idea what these numbers are.  How can you judge the tax bill without them?
@McCombDoug @boblatta So a meaningless gesture that has no real world effect?
@McCombDoug @boblatta Lol, citation needed for illegals voting (Breibart doesn't count).  You should also look up growth and deficit numbers for before and after the tax bill.  Something tells me you haven't.
@McCombDoug @boblatta https://t.co/WHyMkcPNs7
@IngrahamAngle Besides lying to investigators and offering pardons to co-conspirators right?
@McCombDoug @boblatta You tried to say he was a good rep.  If you are going to do that on a public forum you should be able to back it up.  But I appreciate you admitting you can't.
@McCombDoug @boblatta Lol, you still haven't stood up for your rep.  Why did you dodge that one?
@McCombDoug @boblatta Conceding?  Got caught dead there eh?
@McCombDoug @boblatta You should look through your tweets again if you think the insults you receive aren't deserved lol.  I get that your age leads to ignorance but you can still do better.
@McCombDoug @boblatta Umm...no.  Everything I have said is perfectly valid while you dance around the truth.  You will learn someday.
@McCombDoug @boblatta Welcome to the real world kid.  Say stupid shit and get called stupid.
@McCombDoug @boblatta Are you really a college freshman trying to give professional advice?  Maybe take a step back a realize that is why you are so ignorant.  You couldn't possibly know anything about business yet you think you do.
@McCombDoug @boblatta I would never employ someone as ignorant as you lol.  That was the whole point.  I hope you get better and comprehension before you need a real job.
@McCombDoug @boblatta I can contact him whenever and wherever I want.  Since you think he is so great, why do you think he doesn't have any statement on a major political development?  Also, respect is earned, so you don't get any.
@McCombDoug @boblatta Haha, you sure about that?  I really wish you knew how hard you were failing right now.  But ignorance is bliss I suppose.
@McCombDoug @boblatta Notice how you ignored everything I said.  The truth hurts.  You will learn.
@McCombDoug @boblatta It will only benefit you in the long run.  I can tell you as someone who manages several employees people who think they are the smartest in the room when they are less than average struggle way more than the dumbest in the real world.
@McCombDoug @boblatta Just because that upsets you does not make me a bigot.  If anything it should make you reconsider your views since they are so ill-informed.  I would also suggest you recognize you age and try harder to be less of the cliched arrogant 18 yo.
@McCombDoug @boblatta I'm going to lay this out simply for you since you are struggling so much.  Asking a member of Congress for comment on a criminal conspiracy is not out of line.  In fact, you should be embarrassed that your rep isn't commenting on his own.
@McCombDoug @boblatta What makes you think your point is valid?
@McCombDoug @boblatta or do they have multiple definitions too lol

@sariel2005 @KingKush212 @MonarchyUK @theresa_may The tweet we are all responding too (from May) does not mention Russia.  At least you aren't claiming it is a false flag which is nuts because the government is too incompetent for that (and you agree from your tweet I'm assuming)
@LordMVee @sariel2005 @KingKush212 @MonarchyUK @theresa_may Good call.  You could have done that without saying so
@DeplorableMari4 @RepLeeZeldin Haha, Conservatives always give up when faced with facts.  I get it
@LordMVee @sariel2005 @KingKush212 @MonarchyUK @theresa_may Does your PC not have a power button?
@sariel2005 @LordMVee @KingKush212 @MonarchyUK @theresa_may No, Saddam never killed a British citizen so claiming this is like Saddam is false.  You failing to understand the concept does not change that.
@DeplorableMari4 @RepLeeZeldin You proved nothing lol.  Just take it with you that you are the more dangerous and dumber party despite what the swine you surround yourself with says.  Good luck with the education.
@sariel2005 @KingKush212 @LordMVee @MonarchyUK @theresa_may It wasn't a false flag because there was no attack that was claimed to be from Saddam.  Just lies about a threat.  An actual attack is completely different.  It is not that hard to get.
@sariel2005 @KingKush212 @MonarchyUK @theresa_may Yes, but the whole Saddam story was made up.  Someone is responsible for this woman's death so the situation is different.  There is an actual threat because someone is actually dead.  Saddam was never a threat
@sariel2005 @LordMVee @KingKush212 @MonarchyUK @theresa_may I didn't claim it is true.  I just said the Saddam comparison is silly and the trolls went nuts.
@KingKush212 @LordMVee @sariel2005 @MonarchyUK @theresa_may False flag lol.  If you know how incompetent our governments really are you would know how silly that is.
@sariel2005 @KingKush212 @MonarchyUK @theresa_may So who killed this lady.  That is the difference is that an event actually happened.  I didn't get caught out at all.  Point still stands and it was a terrible comparison.
@LordMVee @sariel2005 @KingKush212 @MonarchyUK @theresa_may Claiming it is a lie with no evidence is just as silly, no?  And I didn't say anything except that the Saddam comparison is wrong because someone is actually dead.  It's not like there was a real chemical weapon attack we falsely blamed on Iraq so the comparison doesn't work
@DeplorableMari4 @RepLeeZeldin Judging from that response I am assuming you are conceding on all points and resorting to bullshit.
@PoliticalBrah @KingKush212 @MonarchyUK @theresa_may A hashtag?  Wow, you are serious.
@DeplorableMari4 @RepLeeZeldin Shocking you aren't educated.  I couldn't tell by your generous use of facts to back up your points.  Everything you said is wrong because of that you vote wrong.  Get yourself together by Nov.
@PoliticalBrah @KingKush212 @MonarchyUK @theresa_may Was the journalist they killed fake too?  And Putin killing his opposition was faked?
@PoliticalBrah @KingKush212 @MonarchyUK @theresa_may Lol, you fit all the cliches.  I bow down to your intellect.
@SenShelby Not happy to have you back.  Go away again.
@PoliticalBrah @KingKush212 @MonarchyUK @theresa_may You think she isn't dead, false flag or other?  It is not crazy to think the guys who shot down a plane would do this.  Or was that fake to you brainiac
@PoliticalBrah @KingKush212 @MonarchyUK @theresa_may That is really silly.
@sariel2005 @KingKush212 @MonarchyUK @theresa_may Russia actually killed people so the comparison is not valid.  You all keep trying to dodge the point.
@DeplorableMari4 @RepLeeZeldin One was a neighborhood dispute you half-wit.  Again, Scalise was terrible but nowhere near the damage right wing lunatics have caused.  You struggle with facts, do you have an education?
@PoliticalBrah @KingKush212 @MonarchyUK @theresa_may I asked if Saddam killed UK citizens since the brilliant dude above me brought it up.  Did he?
@DeplorableMari4 @RepLeeZeldin As I have shown, your party is dumber so the idiot label doesn't stick.  Abortion is legal and not murder as defined by SCOTUS so again you fail.  Keep trying though.  This is fun.
