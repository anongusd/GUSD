@threepeaksexp @davidmweissman Where was that ever stated? And where did I disagree with that statement? 	I insinuated that Kamala Harris cheating and sleeping w/ a married man to get ahead was immoral &amp; wondered how the new guy wouldn’t expect the same?
@_kristine_xoxo @emrazz @cmclymer Empathy is letting women do whatever they want with their bodies?	Huh, I don’t remember seeing that definition in my funk &amp; wagnall
@threepeaksexp @davidmweissman Life is, in some cases, yes. But not when it comes to this.	If you want to sleep with someone else, break up/divorce your partner first.	Are you really trying to say that cheating, or sleeping w/ a married person isn’t immoral and incredibly selfish?
@Scoaliera1 @CoreyRobin Because when you get rich, then regulate others you ensure that they have a harder time reaching the levels you have, that is deeply immoral and hypocritical.	When I work my butt off, and you say “you didn’t earn that, let me take it and give it to someone else” that is immoral.
@threepeaksexp @davidmweissman I think that is a nice way to say that one lacks morals.

@remembrancermx @MaxieSonyoutube @Lollardfish @nberlat But, without proving your knowledge of the base material, through tests, without help from others, you wouldn’t have been able to get into grad school. 	Many would skate by and leach off of others and your grad degree would be shared with others less knowledgeable than you
@remembrancermx @MaxieSonyoutube @Lollardfish @nberlat Great for you. Seriously.	But in life, subconsciously, people generalize. 	So when you are afraid of something but overcome and accomplish it, you gain self esteem and confidence that you can overcome other challenges.	They don’t have to be the exact same.
@mdmccleary86 @Lollardfish @nberlat Ok, where are the studies that show which ones prospered and which ones didn’t?
@remembrancermx @MaxieSonyoutube @Lollardfish @nberlat I’m not saying that you’ll take tests, or publicity speak, at work. Im saying that the stress of taking a test or publicly speaking, and overcoming that stress and challenge, will give you confidence that you can overcome similar stresses in the future.
@mdmccleary86 @Lollardfish @nberlat Who are?
@remembrancermx @MaxieSonyoutube @Lollardfish @nberlat You don’t think that putting yourself in challenging situations prepares you, or gives you confidence that you fans handle challenging situations in the future?

@remembrancermx @MaxieSonyoutube @Lollardfish @nberlat They do for me. And they do for many. And taking tests prepared me for it.
@KangahRoh_Art @syalmans @Lollardfish @nberlat It was an example of a high achiever.  Fill in whatever: lawyer, doctor, astronaut.	You don’t get such jobs handed to you if you don’t fit the bill. Nor should you.
@remembrancermx @MaxieSonyoutube @Lollardfish @nberlat So, you are saying stress from tests is like no other stress. Only test stress is what you can’t handle. But stress from deadlines, no problem?	You micro compartmentalize your stress?	Thats impressive.
@remembrancermx @MaxieSonyoutube @Lollardfish @nberlat So you have no stress or deadlines in your work? Wow. Good for you.
@guardie188 @nberlat I had an anxiety disorder. I passed out at a wedding because I had to talk in front of everyone.	I overcame it by someone pushing me to go outside my comfort zone.	You are keeping people down by telling them they can’t do it because if some made up muteism shit.

@guardie188 @nberlat A CEO job isn’t going to be handed to you because you believe you could be one if you weren’t somehow hindered by whatever you were told you have.
@syalmans @Lollardfish @nberlat Good for you. Hope it pays your bills. You’re an inspiration for those like you, and for who I used to be.	But don’t expect a CEO job to be handed to you because you are anxious and feel like you deserve it, because you think if you weren’t anxious, you could be one.
@guardie188 @nberlat If college isn’t for you, it isn’t for you.	We have coddled the millennials (which I’m one) on to a point where they can’t handle anything. 	Be a mail carrier or something.
@mdmccleary86 @Lollardfish @nberlat I know. I work with a bunch of millennials (which, based on my age, I am one) and younger.  A good percentage can’t handle life. 	Weird how a much larger percentage of older people don’t have the same problem.	Wonder why... Coddling maybe?
@leaaves @MaxieSonyoutube @Lollardfish @nberlat I’m a chemical engineer, so I do have a very good education. And no, deadlines are way more stressful than tests. My family’s livelihood depends on them.
@nberlat Ok, what job are these people going for, that pays well and doesn’t allow you to talk to others and never have to meet deadlines?
@syalmans @Lollardfish @nberlat I too have blacked out while speaking in front of crowds. I passed out while speaking at a wedding. 	You know what helped me? Somebody not letting me give up on it?
@MaxieSonyoutube @Lollardfish @nberlat Deadlines are tests.	You must not have a real job.	But your right, a Walmart greeter doesn’t have much stress.

@NotSoProudYank @NewsHour That’s like any job starting out but would be remedied without teachers unions, so it’s a problem of their own making. Good teachers should get paid more than crappy ones who have been there longer.  But if you look at the wage hourly for what they work, it’s more than comparable
@NotSoProudYank @NewsHour Most teachers do not work year round unless they choose to.   And on top of all of the vacations (summer, winter, spring break), they get a number of sick (that often get abused) and vacation days.  The professional days are not long arduous days.

@jason_a_w They are. And no, it wasn’t Fox News. It’s because it’s true.  	It became the truth vs the media and the media lost.  Guess social media is good for something, if only to expose the media for the liars you are.	Telling that Mr. @ReliableSources @brianstelter liked this though.

@hipfan @AG_Conservative What happens prior to, as seen in other videos, the kids were being harassed by black lives matters types.
@hipfan @AG_Conservative Now you’re just trying to bait me into going against my promise. But since you already did, the vid runs an hour before the man approaches the kids. The kids were sitting there quietly, as the vid shows. It only got loud when the guy, being loudly supported, approaches the kids.
@hipfan @AG_Conservative Good point. My bad. Honest mistake.
@AstridUKFVZA @SouthBayPA @jilevin A “Make America Great Again” hat is an insult to Americans before the white man?	What are you talking about?	It is a hat.	Ever been to Washington DC? Ever walked around? You’ll see people and signs all over that would offend you (although they shouldn’t).	Grow up.

@jilevin And Cardi b’s full vocabulary is exhausted.
@hipfan @AG_Conservative Maybe, just maybe, he wasn’t being completely honest. And maybe, just maybe, he saw everyone with a video camera so approached the kids to get such a photo op, and get people like you to believe him.
@hipfan @AG_Conservative None of the videos show it and he is the only one who said it.  Everyone else, and all video footage disprove it.	Come on. Use your brain. He approached them and was on tv 5 minutes after. It is called a set up. 	Stop being so naive.
@SouthBayPA @jilevin How is the kid standing quietly smiling, while the old man, who approached the kid, is beating his drum and chanting in the kids face, being the harasser?	If you’re going to blatantly lie, you guys need to swap the picture to better fit your premise.
@womensmarch @SarahPearr @WomensMarchWI As long as it doesn’t benefit the Jews, right?
@hipfan @AG_Conservative Did u even see the video? Or do u just believe what some questionable outlet says?	I even went back to look (using Slate) to make sure I was correct. They never chanted build the wall. 	I hadn’t heard that, so googled it, and it is in multiple places that it was misreported.
@beelze_bufo @suzydymna I was joking. Apologize if I offended you.
@tonyposnanski Are you just trying to be the next krassenstein in hopes that just opposing trump will gain you followers because your comedian career doesn’t put food on the table?
@hipfan @AG_Conservative They were told to wait there by the chaperones. They were chanting school spirit slogans. 	You need to be more skeptical.
@hipfan @AG_Conservative You apparently didn’t see the video leading up to it. He and a mob behind him approached them. Not the other way around.	He went up to them, beating a drum and chanted.	They were chanting some school slogan until he got there.	And again, they are kids.
@beelze_bufo @suzydymna I don’t have play store. And did in google for iOS. Downloaded one, and it didn’t work. 	But thanks for being no help at all.
@AG_Conservative No way. No excuse anymore. We all know what media does to fit their narrative. I immediately asked “what is the context and why isn’t the video leading up to that incident included”.	Understanding context should be the default in the media or anyone else for that matter.

@eyeofthegoddess That’s a fine quote &amp; is relevant today as it relates to the left shutting down speech &amp; attempting to make speech &amp; violence equivalent.	Doesn’t relate to thousands sneaking across the border illegally. 		They have been coached as to what to say.
@eyeofthegoddess Ports of entry. You go to a point of entry and tell the Border Patrol agent that you are there for asylum.	No one believes that a majority of them even need asylum as intended.	As many have said candidly, they are here to get paid more than they would at home.
@eyeofthegoddess You keep robotically spouting the same talking point without apparently reading.  I’m not saying seeking asylum is illegal. I said, illegally sneaking across the border is illegal. 	And knowing this, and still doing it, puts the result on the parents.

@SethAMandel Well, as you know (based on who you have written/edited for) in general, the left never does. 	So, even if it is true, it is fun to demonstrate their hypocrisy
@revrrlewis Is that supposed to be a @buzzfeed support argument?
@PnxNotDed @thistallawkgirl I’ve never heard, or known, a person who has had gay sex, without being gay. Seems like it’s a prerequisite (without getting into the whole I’m bi, not gay argument).
@swiftliz216 @thistallawkgirl Why not, instead of pointing out the ignorance in questions, you enlighten by answering?
@NoelHansen74 @thistallawkgirl I’m bitter? Of what?	You’re the one who felt the need to respond to me with insults when the questions weren’t even for you. That’s a real symptom of bitterness. Seems like you’re projecting.
@MichaelRHAMEL1 @thistallawkgirl If found the Canadian trolls are the most cliche and mindless.	You do not disappoint.
@ChadwickFurr Didn't vote for him.  But again, I've found that those who insert themselves but can't form a logical argument while doing so, are most likely mentally unstable, lack IQ or both.
@MichaelRHAMEL1 @thistallawkgirl Too late. 3 boys.	In my experience, those who resort to such responses are either slow, mentally unstable, or both, and unable to intellectually add to whatever conversation they decide to add themselves to.
@PnxNotDed @thistallawkgirl I don't think that answers my question. If one would be willing to have gay sex, wouldn't you have to be gay to be willing to do so?
@thistallawkgirl Wouldn't think of it since, these days, the act of hitting on someone would be considered sexual harassment.	Or, is it not, since it is a woman hitting on a woman?  	Wait, did you just hit on me by asking if I was hitting on you?	Changing rules make it all so confusing.	#metoo

@thistallawkgirl Um, there are other options.	But that begs the quesiton: do you have to be gay to have gay sex?  Seems to me like you would have to be.	Which begs the follow up question:  Are you contending that being gay is a choice?

@ejkalafarski @cjane87 I am not asking about the modern Repub Party.  She wrote about conservatives.  And, I absolutely don't hate the left if they start becoming more small gov, states rights, decreasing exec power, etc.  It seems like many on the left have a new found respect for such things.
@cjane87 @benshapiro The left which support a large gov &amp; large gov overreach which confiscates more money, through increased taxes to fund large infrastructure projects, which, by necessity, must grab private land, via Eminent Domain.	What am I missing?  Is there any left of center not bigger gov?
@cjane87 @benshapiro Ok, well I don't have 500 words to use in a story; just the 280 twitter affords.  But we all know what I mean. We have to generalize because not all instances can be taken into account.	And again, in general:  Cons: against big gov/overreach.  Libs: For Big gov overreach.
@binarybits @cjane87 Em dom is opposed by small gov cons. Ms. Coaston admitted this. Which means that the big-gov opposite (namely the left) doesn't have an issue w/ it. 	As she does, &amp; we all do, we can't name every instance, therefore we have to use Left/Right. In gen: Left big gov; right small gov
@play2livesoccer @cjane87 What public?  The American public?  Because the wall is not used for corporate greed, and, at some point throughout the last 15 years or so, both sides agreed that a physical boundary was in the best interest of the country.
@SurtChilling @cjane87 So, only when it "harms" certain demographics or protected groups?
@cjane87 You know what I am talking about since u yourself describe cons as anti-big gov &amp; anti-big gov overreach.	So, if u want to say now u don't know what the opposite of cons, then you yourself need to define terms.  e.g. @benshapiro or Trump ballpark
@weber_daron @cjane87 Headline incl: Big Gov Tactic (non-con). She describes tht it's typically used to take private land for public use. "Among many cons, the principle of em dom is broadly unpopular &amp; example of gov overreach.. Goes double when used for the benefit of private corps.
@cjane87 Americans who are ideological left of center, namely those who are in favor of a large federal government.  	Pretty sure you knew that though.
@GlennKesslerWP Now you're decrying anonymous sources?	Funny since that is what the left/MSM has been relying on for the past 2 years.
@cjane87 When did the left start opposing Eminent domain?	Never mind, I know.
