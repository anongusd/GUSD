@Wizards_DnD going to be a DM soon for the first time. Exciting! Ps: I don't own any of these photos. Just good reference photos! https://t.co/t9aIVls8Gi
@RichlandSD400 What's the word on after-school activities?
RT @JonTronShow: Ever wanted to not die while on the job? Come with me and take lessons from the best in Workplace Safety: https://t.co/eE9‚Ä¶
@elonmusk I love this https://t.co/TAu3MIOqF2
@RichlandSD400 What is the word on after-school activities?
@elonmusk You won't.
@YouTube @mrkatedotcom @jamescharles Ew
@kathygriffin @kbhome Looks like you can't take the heat or an angry man, Kathy.
@kathygriffin They support the border wall.
@WarhorseStudios Another game please?
@RichlandSD400 Is school canceled?
@matthewmercer ever heard of the Lit-ness role? It is a tradition with my boios on game night.
@Copacolondrios @Snakey_Bakey But why
@Snakey_Bakey Yay
@KCMikki @kukks16 @JKCorden A real hah gotem moment, huh?! Even though it was totally uncalled for and as soon as he said something you questioned his intelligence. I'm afraid an argument was over your head, and instead of trying to talk about it you insulted him to hide
@KCMikki @kukks16 @JKCorden "Russian interference"	-the only thing that was proven without a shadow of a doubt was ads-
@JKCorden "The president of the united states can be bad" -wastes time saying that-		"Yes? Good ok."		This was a waste of time.
Glad to know im not the only one.
When you're tired, annoyed, and burnt out because of school. This is what I want to do.	#KingdomComeDeliverance https://t.co/Sg8EDNPx1n
@kathygriffin That is a very ignorant point of view. "Is it me or do all the black senators look alike?" Or "hey, how come these native American chieftains all look alike?"
@SuperBowl Twas a disgrace, and you pandered for money rather than striving for history.
@SuperBowl Your betrayal of SpongeBob's rendition of 'Sweet Victory' marks the downfall of human civilization.
@kathygriffin @upfrontvc Are you funny? Nah.
@WarhorseStudios will there be a sequel to KCD, or possibly an entirely new but similar game?

@Q_Review I think you are paraphrasing it wrong.

@TalbertSwan "To a group of girls" this is false.
@TalbertSwan They are just kids man. One doesn't make them all bad. If you watched the whole video you would have heard about the black Israelites.
@PhotoCalder @_SJPeace_ Because people are trying to destroy his life.
@CHSommers Maybe because people are on their phones 6 hours a day

RT @charliekirk11: Did you know:		The coffee shop where @Ocasio2018 ‚Äúgot her start‚Äù had to close down because minimum wage hikes have put t‚Ä¶
@charliekirk11 You should probably be specific instead of saying "the left" it makes for a better argument.
@dailyblastlive @Kellycoms @jeffschroeder23 Yet you still hate on Trump ü§î
@CaseyR58 @realDonaldTrump @GOPLeader @RepLaMalfa @KenCalvert @fema 'You don't anything'?

@Vahal18 @ManWithTheBFG @realDonaldTrump It's still a sizeable chunk. Plus the introduction of political parties of those groups, that can be supported outside of those groups. The damage can be major.
@OomlesArt @markiplier @cloakbrand It's not necessarily a problem. But diversity in how someone looks doesn't matter much.
@RepSwalwell One gun in the eighteenth century is not gonna tumble a government. But today and back then guns can win against the government. Many people that are in the military are patriotic and or care for that right so much, they will steal from the gov. Tanks for the public.
@Torvarren @CHSommers "Is that a paper clip? License and registration. You know that's a choking hazard! Criminal scum."
@Eddy_Saar It really does suck.
@realDonaldTrump Any meaningful responses that will change peoples mind on the subject? Nope... No... Nuh huh... Well, time to go.
@Fuzzy_Fuzzbutt @realDonaldTrump This cartoon is?
@TigerT72 @realDonaldTrump Trump is fine with legal immigrants but loves legal immigrants that become nationalistic or patriotic for America.
@ArtCarfi @Barbara37552171 @TigerT72 @realDonaldTrump Welp, we used this land better than the natives.
@charliekirk11 Out of nowhere?
@ashdmitch @realDonaldTrump Ya dumb

@Rachelh08589732 @realDonaldTrump Like man, you took 3 my brain cells
@MacarelliMike @ManWithTheBFG @realDonaldTrump Muslims can have greater population within European countries in upcoming years and have their own political parties, its more complex than you may think
@Vahal18 @ManWithTheBFG @realDonaldTrump yeah four MILLION isn't that much
@efudd1203 @realDonaldTrump You don't understand buddy...
@DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump Your supporting tribalism. "Democrats" they them, us we complex
@scrowder Tucker, threatened and harassed. Ask harder questions.
No matter what, vote. Dont vote what on what someone wants you to vote. Vote on the things that you know about. If you cant pull out reasons why from your own mind or memory then you dont have the knowledge to vote on that particular part.
