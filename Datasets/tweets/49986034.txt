a large piece of Baggage is “I defrauded my grandmother of her life savings to support my erotic pigeon art habit” 	“I like the music of Phil Collins” IS NOT
To have a crush on Phil Collins is a NATURAL STATE of being and, with the craven addition of the modifier man-crush, is barely even a revelation worth MENTIONING let alone a LARGEST PIECE OF BAGGAGE
“I have a man-crush on Phil Collins” is NOT a largest piece of Baggage and I am fully incensed!!

@kylooooooo @forcemates @HopeyVar @KyloR3n Thank you for taking the time to explain. I am definitely sorry for what I said. I don’t think I have any high ground. All I have is an opinion and I was wrong to assume anything about people who didn’t share it or to suggest they weren’t being thoughtful adults in reaching it.
@pbump someday, with our powers combined, we will figure out a way to parody it that stops the original from happening!
this is delicious @pbump https://t.co/jCu4YxATiv
@_sashayed i'll be the idiot
@forcemates @HopeyVar @KyloR3n But the thing that makes me feel sick is the feeling that I talked about it in a way that made anyone feel like they were ever being laughed at, not with. This would never have become my life if I didn’t sincerely appreciate him and the people who love him. That’s where I failed.
@forcemates @HopeyVar @KyloR3n no, totally, my take on the character is something I’ve thought about and I’m happy to disagree and argue about for hours (how much can he be redeemed? Is it all Snoke’s fault? etc!) but what I feel awful about is that it sounded like I wanted anyone to feel bad for liking him.
@vende_bresof @KyloR3n i’m so sorry. I did a bad job expressing my thoughts. I’m glad I was able to make you laugh for a while and I regret that my words caused you hurt. Anyone who makes you feel bad about what you love isn’t worth your time, and I’m so sorry that it was me. May the force be with you
@HopeyVar @forcemates @KyloR3n Thank you for being honest. You obviously don’t owe me any further engagement, but I’d love to know what a less hollow Sorry would look like. I never want anyone to feel bad or mocked for the things they love and the thought that my words hurt in that way is the worst feeling.
does something called the Tide Podcast exist yet
@hetthuocchua @readingsummer @KyloR3n Sorry to jump in. You’re saying so many right things. Just wanted to say: that was my real face! In the long chat I had with Skytalkers I think I did a much better job articulating my feelings about the character and fandom than I managed to in that interview. I wasn’t pretending
@IoJovi @forcemates @KyloR3n I appreciate the clarification. That was the nicest thing anyone’s ever sent me even as a regular human and I was really excited about it, not trying to make fun. But I don’t think I got that across, so, nuts to what I intended. I’m deeply sorry.
@forcemates @KyloR3n I always tried my best to make the account a place anyone who loves Kylo can feel welcome. I’m sorry me opening my mouth and sticking my foot in made it feel like anything but.
@forcemates @KyloR3n I’m so sorry. Sometimes I‘m bad at doing talking about what I love and this was one of those times. If I didn’t love and empathize with Kylo I wouldn’t have spent years writing him and I don’t look down on anyone else who does. I’m sorry a thing I said made the world more garbage

@Piscesboy69 (fair!) but no specifically I want to see hugh jackman steal bread

but seriously why is everyone in dc ravenously reading a book about how Steve Bannon was right about everything, recently lost a lot of weight, and will be president soon

The Steve Bannon I remember was given to pronouncements like “Darkness is good” and “I am Thomas Cromwell in the court of the Tudors.”	This does sound made-up, to be quite frank with you.  https://t.co/XS1AyHEfoC

@ebruenig my equally Star Wars obsessed friend immediately said HOLDO IS CALVINIST fwiw
@ebruenig but I don’t actually have a clear denomination for her at all
@ebruenig I say Kylo is an ex-Mormon and the nuns are totes Carmelites. Poe is whatever his ex was. Holdo is the lady with a guitar at the 10 o’clock service who was supposed to appeal to teens but she secretly is very strict doctrinally, I want to say Methodist
@ebruenig but hux is entirely correct I can vouch for his Anglicanism
@ebruenig ugh these outcomes serve me right for not voting

Dracula Characters, Ranked		Van Helsing	Renfield	Quincey Morris	The Old Man Who Sits Gossiping By The Sea	Jack Seward	Mina Harker	Mrs. Westenra	Lucy Westenra	Jonathan Harker	Arthur Holmwood	Dracula I guess
how are there so many people who don’t appreciate Dr. Seward’s narration 	when did Jonathan Harker spend quality time with a MAN WHO EATS FLIES just for your reading amusement and then dictate it onto a wax cylinder	AT NO POINT
RT @risaakutabi: QUINCEY MORRIS DESERVED BETTER
@ArmchairDabbler no, it’s good! I bet you’d still enjoy it! But it’s not urgent
@ArmchairDabbler no it’s not worth it!!

so far everyone who’s answered has been correct
