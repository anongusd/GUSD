"Fairness would dictate that the [sexual harassment] claims would at least meet the threshold of 'more likely than not,'" Collins says. Ford's "fail" to meet this standard, she said, and therefore, the accusations "cannot prevent Kavanaugh from serving on the court."
THIS is why Democrats did NOT want Michael Avenatti to get involved in this fight. Collins is specifically citing Swetnick's "gang rape" accusation as something that made her think she needed to give Kavanaugh the benefit of the doubt.
COLLINS: "Certain fundamental legal principals about due process, the presumption of innocence and fairness do bare on my thinking and I cannot abandon them."

Oof.. "Individual 14."  -&gt;  "On or about June 21, 2011, in Washington, D.C., DUNCAN HUNTER spent $162.02 in Campaign funds for a personal stay at the Liaison Capitol Hill hotel with Individual 14."
Hunter's legal defense is taking a page out of Donald Trump's playbook, arguing that the probe was biased against Hunter bc two prosecutors apparently attended a Clinton rally (Hunter was BIG Trump backer). Hunter lawyer asked that they be recused but they were not.

Trump/the WH has stepped up its whipping effort on the immigration bill. GOP leaders are bussing "undecided" members to the White House to talk to POTUS and Jeff Sessions is at the RSC meeting. Yet Trump cancels the congressional dinner...
OMG! Trump is CANCELLING the congressional picnic, dissing GOP lawmakers on the SAME DAY that they're supposed to take a politicly  toxic immigration vote for him. Can't make this up, folks -&gt; https://t.co/dhOtSGnh7R
Meanwhile, House GOP leaders are still arguing that it's an either-or situation and that only Congress can fix this... https://t.co/a9jwP6etWX
House GOP leaders are completely echoing Trump administration talking point that it‚Äôs either-or under current law: border security or separating families. But even MANY Senate Rs disagree and are asking Trump to pause this policy now while they work something out
.@SteveScalise is going to bat for the compromise bill today, talking up the DACA/Wall trigger mechanism. Echoing Ryan and WH argument that it‚Äôs the law of the land/congress has to act
GOP leadership wants today‚Äôs presser to be abt the six-month anniversary of tax reform passage. @RepKevinBrady is even here. But $10 says they don‚Äôt get a single tax question. The border crisis has upended GOP messaging completely.

Trump tells Republicans: ‚ÄúWe are going to get this done. I‚Äôm with you. I love you people.‚Äù lol.
Apparently Trump praised @MarioDB's "trigger" idea multiple times and said he likes MDB more than his brother. lol. In the bill, the DACA pathway to citizenship shuts down if ANY of the $25b in wall money is rescinded.
So Trump endorsed BOTH immigration bills. So if I'm a conservative worried about getting primaried for voting on the compromise bill, why not just back the original Goodlatte bill? Technically wouldn't be going against Trump, right? Does this help leadership? Guess we'll see.
Seems to me the verdict is in and House Rs feel Trump essentially endorsed the compromsise bill, albeit in a round about way
"If we can build the wall, we'll have something done," Trump tells Republicans. He also says "we have to take care of these separations."
After dissing poor Sanford, Trump is back on immigration. He says he is okay with a pathway for Dreamers with the wall. Says wall + DACA is an 88% approval issue, though he rejected this deal before...
"nasty guy." https://t.co/zihyP9Lot9
Trump just said something along the lines of: "Is @RepSanfordSC here? I want to congratulate him on his race!" OUCH!
Trump appears to be more interesting in talking about anything BUT immigration at this conference. He is re-living the past, going through GOP successes from rebuilding the military to opioids to tax cuts to NK to fighter jets and lots and lots of winning, per sources in the room
Trump tells GOP they have to pass one of their two DACA bills but doesn't appear to throw his weight behind one or the other. He just says "I'm with you 100 percent!" This doesn't seem like an endorsement to me. At least not the boost GOP leaders wanted for the compromise bill

And THERE IT IS: @RepJeffDenham says that @freedomcaucus offered a new visa for dreamers, which would eventually lead to citizenship. HFC is denying this completely. Denham is flabbergasted when I tell him conservatives said no offer was made. Now everyone will point fingers.

If this meeting results in a stalemate, as most expect, moderates hope GOP Reps. Dennis Ross &amp; Dan Newhouse will sign the discharge petition. Dems expect Henry Cuellar, the last Dem holdout, to do the same, reaching 218 &amp; triggering the daca votes in late June. https://t.co/ZBW9KAAiYn

Trump asks Congress for a line-item veto on spending bills and tells the Senate -- again -- they need to ditch filibuster rule. McConnell will love this.
Trump chiding Congress hardcore here: "There are a lot of things that I am unhappy about in this bill... I will say to Congress: I will never sign a bill like this again. nobody read it. it's only hours old."
So far, Trump blaming Dems right now, saying they're demanding "wasteful" spending in return for military plus-up. But this morning he was upset abt the lack of wall funding.
Trump will have to acknowledge in this presser that he is signing this bill even tho he hates it. I'm curious to see if he blames GOP leaders for not brining him a better bill -- or if he turns his ire on Pelosi, Schumer &amp; the Dems.

House Dems wouldn't even clap, let alone stand, when Trump talked about a path to citizenship for 1.8 million. #SOTU
Trump says "Americans are dreamers too" but this is not the type of Dreamer that Dems wanted to hear him talk about tonight. What about DACA? #SOTU
Trump getting into immigration talking FIRST to the base, talking about border security and cracking down on loopholes allowing illegal immigration
Trump talks abt two girls murdered by MS-13 who came here, he says, thru "glaring loopholes in our laws to enter the country as unaccompanied alien minors" #SOTU
Some HFC members did NOT stand for family leave. Dems loved it tho #SOTU
Trump just borrowed a line from @SpeakerRyan: "from welfare to work." #SOTU
Trump now talking about infrastructure, but here's the thing: That ain't gonna happen without a DACA fix and long-term caps deal, neither of which he's talked abt so far tonight #SOTU
Another Trump adlib on prescription drugs: "Prices will come¬†down substantially. Watch." Such confidence #SOTU
Dems liked that one: Trump talks about reducing the prices of prescription drugs. Even Pelosi and Hoyer stood for that one. #SOTU
Hilarious. You can tell Trump's Cabinet is getting tired of sitting and standing. Just watch their faces. #SOTU
We're about 35 minutes in and still no mention of immigration. Friendly reminder: DACA expires March 5. #SOTU
Trump makes an dig at the NFL in the #SOTU. THis is why we stand for the national anthem, he says.
Bipartisan applause and standing O for Preston Sharp, a 12 year old who has put 40K american flags on veteran graves. #SOTU
So this line got some Dems standing: "We all share the same home, the same heart, the same destiny, and the same great American flag." #SOTU
Notice how much time Trump is spending on tax reform. GOPers say, if they have a prayer at keeping the majority next year, it's bc of this. #SOTU
Trump ad-libbing in typical Trump fashion on a lot of these #SOTU lines: "Staub Manufacturing -- a small BEAUTIFUL business in Ohio." &amp; Tax changes help "average family income by more than $4,000, A LOT OF MONEY." All caps are Trump's adlibs.
There it is: Trump touting repeal of individual mandate, even though Rs actually failed to repeal Obamacare last year. They got that small piece tho. #SOTU
There it is: tax reform. GOP's biggest legislative achievement to date, one MANY thought would never pass. Rs plan to tout that to try to defend their majorities in 2018 #SOTU
When Trump says "African-American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded" no CBC members stand. They recently called him racists bc of the "s--hole" comment. #SOTU
Trump starts #SOTU praising heroes and calling for bipartisanship. But Dems are having none of it. When Trump says "I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground" very few stand. One that did: Manchin #SOTU
Trump praises the "legend from Louisiana" @SteveScalise, who took a bullet this year and LIVED. Some think this guy will be speaker someday. #SOTU

Good point. Trump has all but squashed fiscal conservatives in the party of Lincoln so maybe there will be no blowback -&gt; https://t.co/pcr8gOXLqz
And by "great" I mean: At a time when people are saying he's mentally unstable &amp; unfit to serve, he looked pretty stable to me. Say what you will abt his demands for a DACA deal, he just hosted a 45 min open-press negotiation session. https://t.co/OS1bZtijAo
Consider this: Trump gave a shoutout to the Goodlatte bill that drops tomorrow. No way in heck that Dems will back that. Even GOP leadership isn't sure they can put it on the floor bc moderate Rs won't back it. https://t.co/OS1bZtijAo
Sure, this open negotiation session made Trump look great &amp; sure there were lots of pleasantries. But GUYS!: Rs still want a wall, chain migration &amp; visa lottery program &amp; Ds are still unwilling. We are no closer to a DACA deal.

Trump says if they tackle welfare reform, they would do so in a BIPARTISAN way (re: no reconciliation), which  means that's not happening... Ds won't back this
VEEP Pence also says there are opportunities for "bipartisan work" in 2018, cites infrastructure.
McConnell says 2018 will be more bipartisan... That's bc Rs need Ds to increase budget caps, fix DACA and raise the debt ceiling. The GOP base won't be happy
McConnell starts his remarks talking abt how 2017 was a great year for Rs. Show Rs are not in any way convinced that 2018 will live up to last year...
Trump "the meetings were perhaps transformative in many ways." But adds that he agrees w/McConnell that 2017 -- w/ tax reform -- will be a "tough year to top"
