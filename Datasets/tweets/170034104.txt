Lots of luck narrative weavers, this cycle is Jabberwocky
Coda to TX Senate: with 94% reporting, Cruz wins by 2.8%. 	Cruz is an extremely disciplined candidate, did not commit a single error, a master at winning a red state.	A year ago, no one (including me) would've predicted O'Rourke would've made it this close.	Hell of a race.
Thus far, there's been only 1 true upset in the House: a "likely Republican" race, OK-5, has flipped to @HornForCongress
A favorite Pete-ism (acc to his staffers) was: "Let's make the big deal THE BIG DEAL." Well, this is the big deal: change happens, even in Texas. https://t.co/vlbH6XEnYQ
And also for historical trends. Party in power was expected to lose in House. Most of those states that went for Trump in 2016 were expected to fall to Republicans. Historical breakthrough tonight is women. Otherwise, yawn. https://t.co/S5LQldMfoo
DCCC was hugely excited about Kelly candidacy, had been recruiting him for years https://t.co/vVhz2CO7FX
Fun fact: with Lance loss, all 8 House Republicans who voted for 2009 cap &amp; trade bill have all been defeated or have retired https://t.co/H5KSl1aBuK
Also for Texas: O'Rourke loss expected, but Allred &amp; Fletcher wins are big House pickup
By my tally @Lizzie4Congress puts the D's over the top. Women completely carried it tonight.
Also, as expected, those carrying the D's over the finish line in House swing districts--they're not progressive firebrands
New  D House victors include: @Ocasio2018, @ElaineLuriaVA, @wildforcongress, @HaleyLive, @MikieSherrill, @sharicedavids, @DonnaShalala, @JenniferWexton &amp; by the looks of it @SpanbergerVA07.

2) Caro was thought to have fierce local competition when he began, esp. from Austin writer Ronnie Dugger. His 2nd book, Means of Ascent, was savaged by the Texas press who didn't like seeing an Easterner mess with LBJ's image. Master of the Senate ended the native hostility. https://t.co/hzGLRIbUWt
Two other related factoids: 	1) Caro had just won a Pulitzer for his Robert Moses book. Knopf's Robert Gottlieb thus afforded Caro a long leash but was also a writer's advocate in a way publishers seldom are anymore. (HE PAID CARO AN ANNUAL SALARY, NOT JUST AN ADVANCE.) 1/2 https://t.co/TqGDatanTF
In fact, interest in LBJ was low when Knopf signed Caro in 1976, 3 years after Johnson's death. Caro convinced his publisher, &amp; readers, that LBJ's life was the best way to understand modern political power.
