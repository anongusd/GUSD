.@GeoffRBennett on President Trump on the road: Anybody looking for thoughtful, nuanced policy discussion a couple of weeks out from the election isn't going to get it. The President is talking in broad strokes about Brett Kavanaugh and immigration.

.@LarrySabato on Republicans in the midterms: They were energized by the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings. I think the Republicans are making other attempts to energize them, as Sen. McConnell is doing by bringing up the subject of repealing Obamacare again.
.@hiattf on Jamal Khashoggi: He knew he was taking a risk, but he felt there were so many people in his own country that can't speak up freely, who are muzzled, who are imprisoned and he had an obligation to try to spread the word.
.@JoyceWhiteVance on Biden talking Mueller investigation: It's interesting that Biden recommends no one taking any action until Mueller's report is released. That would seem to be the right approach because we have no idea what the full scope is.

.@noellenikpour on GOP donors and voters on the President‚Äôs name-calling: They do not like it. The thing of it is, they look past this behavior and it's on both sides.
.@espyforsenate on avoiding a runoff: We are doing really well and there's a swing up in our third quarter financial report. It's showing up in enthusiasm and showing up in that NBC survey monkey poll.
.@TexasTribAbby on Texas Senate race: I don't have a handle on who will turn out - these polls are indicative. For right now, I would bet money Sen. Cruz is going to have two terms but I have a lack of confidence in a lot of things happening in American politics now.
.@jasonsjohnson on the President tweeting support for Sen. Cruz: I think what Cruz needs and Reps. across the state of Texas and the country need are turn out, but the President does help with turn out.
.@MariaTeresa1on Beto O‚ÄôRourke‚Äôs fiery debate performance: The problem is Cruz, this is where he excels. He was king of the Harvard debate team and this is where he likes the person to come swinging.
.@fordrs58 on the U.S. government: I'm a little concerned that the U.S. government will give credibility to a Saudi internal investigation that may not be very credible. In a sense the Saudis are investigating themselves.
.@fordrs58 on Jamal Khashoggi: Jamal was a lovely person. Not a fire-breathing radical at all but a very thoughtful, soft spoken man and a very independent thinker.
.@Redistrict on where the President stands with educated women: His approval ratings with women is 33% in the last NBC/Wall Street Journal poll. Guess who votes in the midterms? It's college educated women.

.@AnaMariaArchila on POTUS criticism of ‚Äúpaid professionals‚Äù protesting: When I was talking to Sen. Flake in that moment, I was a woman. I was a mother. I was a survivor, and I was someone who believes that we can connect and make better decisions for each other.
.@AnaMariaArchila on Sen. Flake‚Äôs vote: He has a tremendous opportunity to demonstrate that men have a role in helping change the culture that allows sexual violence to be so prevalent. The experience of Dr. Ford is not hers alone.
.@GarrettHaake on what happens next: The fact that Sen. Murkowski was a no and Sen. Flake was a yes is fascinating to me. I've been saying for 2 days now I thought Murkowski was the most likely to vote no here. She's politically bulletproof and is listening to women from Alaska.
.@SenatorCardin on avoiding drama: I think this could have been handled differently by the Republican leadership. There were two sets of hearings, in both cases the investigations prior to those hearings were inadequate, I think that led to the problems.
.@SenatorCardin on Sen. Flake‚Äôs vote: I know he's under tremendous pressure from all sides. He will do what he thinks is right. I hope at the end of the day he votes not to confirm.
.@KellyO on Sen. Flake latest: I've been talking to multiple sources who have been in contact with Sen. Flake. They say he has not revealed his decision, but he is weighing a lot of concerns and factors.

‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre all to blame,‚Äù @POTUS says - leaning in to his tweet earlier blaming the US (and not just the country that attacked the 2016 election) for state of US-Russia relations.
Remember: US intel agencies‚Äô assessments leave no doubt: Russia did it. And they may do it again.

2) But they're not simpatico on immigration. While Pres. Trump leaned into his immigration-is-bad-for-Europe rhetoric, May defended immigration as good for the UK.
Some takeaways:		1) Damage control: POTUS tried to walk back his explosive intv by differentiating between slamming May vs. slamming her policy on Brexit. (Again: the audio's out there.)		Hand-holding seemed intentional to say: world, we're still pals!
.@POTUS says he didn‚Äôt criticize the prime minister - says the Sun story was ‚Äúgenerally fine‚Äù but didn‚Äôt include the ‚Äútremendous things‚Äù he said about May personally.		But the president DID blast May‚Äôs Brexit plan. It‚Äôs on tape. Today: damage control.

Should Breitbart part ways with Steve Bannon? @PressSec: "I certainly think that it's something they should look at."

Point being: Rick Gates may not be as well-known as Paul Manafort, but he has multiple campaign/GOP ties.
Gates worked closely with RNC. After inauguration, he worked on pro-Trump super PAC for several months.
Rick Gates had a much less high-profile/public-facing role, but was Manafort‚Äôs right-hand guy. Remember: stayed ON after Manafort left.
Manafort was promoted in May to campaign ‚Äúchair‚Äù - a de facto managerial role. Played critical part during convention / delegate drama.
So! Few things. Paul Manafort joined Team Trump in spring 2016 - and while Sean Spicer tried to say he had "limited role," that's not true.
