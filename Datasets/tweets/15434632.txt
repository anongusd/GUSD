And that means a lot of projects in a lot of Congressional districts are about to be cut. Good luck with that.

There’s a lot of loose talk about walls, barrier systems, fences, etc. Confused? Check out our primer on what the U.S. government has spent so far on border barriers. Grand total? $9.7 billion. Feel safer yet? https://t.co/k0S4RrKLZb
The committee draft states this would be above the $1.6 billion in previous versions of the bill, for a total of $5.7 billion. But, that $1.6 billion was for other border security spending, and not for a #wall. So spending that money on a wall is a substantive legislative change.
The Senate Appropriations Committee has drafted legislation to fund the rest of the federal government through the end of FY2019. Chairman Richard Shelby’s draft would include an additional $4.1 billion for a ‘physical barrier system’ on the #border.

Finally, re: that $1.5 million in bid revenue. Every Costco shopper knows it's about unit price, not total.	Avg. bid/acre in the 13 sales b/w 1999-2017: $49.67	Avg. bid/acre yesterday: $8	AKA, just above the legal min. ($5/acre) and lower than EVERY NPR-A sale save one. 4/5
Also in 13 NPR-A sales between 1999-2017, 12.5% of tracts were bid on.	Yesterday, 16 of 254 tracts had bids - 6.3%	i.e. low interest in NPR-A leases. In part b/c BLM offers up so many tracts yearly, there's no need to buy now (compared to, say, the "Disney Vault" approach) 3/5
First, lease sales should be fostering competition, because that's what drives higher bidding (more $$ for taxpayers). Yesterday, there was NO COMPETITION:		3 companies submitted a total of 16 bids for 16 tracts of land.	i.e. no tract had more than one bidder...	2/5
In addition to 6 other sales this week, @BLMNational accepted bids for oil &amp; gas leases in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPR-A) yesterday. You may hear some crowing about it raising $1.5 million. Don't be fooled! It was a pretty terrible lease sale for taxpayers...1/5

(6/6) Ultimately, when we look at the data in the context of the built-in low return to taxpayers, we don't see a mutually beneficial boon for industry and us.
(5/6) By rigged, we mean, the leasing process and terms are STRUCTURALLY designed to help O&amp;G companies pay us less:		Federal royalty rates lag state rates, rental fees are historically low, on-lease gas use is free, wasted gas is un-accounted for, etc., etc.
(4/6)That has led to more acres actually leased on federal lands. Excluding AK, there were 2.2 TIMES more acres leased in FY18 than FY17.		“But,” you ask, “isn’t more federal oil &amp; gas development good for taxpayers?”		Ideally, yes... *BUT* not when the leasing system is rigged.
(3/6) Most of the jump is due to a huge NPR-A sale in Alaska last Dec. where 10.3 million acres were offered (only 0.8% sold). But excluding Alaska, in FY18, there were still 2.7 TIMES more acres offered than in FY17, and 4.4 TIMES more than FY16.
(2/6) One thing is clear: In the last fiscal year, there's been a huge surge in land available to lease. There were 5.3 TIMES more acres offered for lease in FY18 than FY17 https://t.co/UCJhrkdYXU
(1/6) Like @EricLiptonNYT @HirokoTabuchi we’ve analyzed a LOT of data on oil &amp; gas leasing on federal lands.

If you haven’t already, be sure to check out the new CBO report - https://t.co/69nVS4uyOT - on how much of OCO $ is spent on base budget items. Spoiler alert: about 70%.
The ‘austere’ $700 billion request will likely scrimp on Congressionally-supported programs. The $733 billion budget will include them. Which one will Congress support?
Pentagon and OMB are drafting two different budget requests: one for $700 billion and one for $733 billion. We’re willing to bet the larger figure ends up winning. Anyone want to bet against us?
The president’s FY19 Pentagon budget request was $597 billion in base budget and $89 billion for OCO. So just 8 months ago, the administration asked for a ‘mere’ $686 billion. The deal to evade budget caps allowed spending to explode.
Defense trade press is labeling a potential $700 billion Pentagon budget for next year a ‘cut.’ Let’s take a look at a few facts. https://t.co/URSoerwmiw

So the @forestservice (USFS) is considering a new rule to (possibly) exempt #Tongass from the Roadless Rule. If they do:		Expanded timber sales ➡️ more roads ➡️ BIGGER losses for taxpayers.		Bottom line: USFS needs to put taxpayer interests above a few private timber companies
Background: we ALREADY lose $millions every year subsidizing #Tongass timber sales, partly by paying for roads for logging co.s. The '01 #Roadless Rule helps limit these costs by preventing sales in unroaded areas- the most expensive places. But Alaska officials wants to gut it.
In recent comments we told the @forestservice that when analyzing options for managing Roadless areas in the #Tongass Nat'l Forest, they need to account for ALL costs to taxpayers from expanding timber sales. SPOILER ALERT: we think it would cost $MILLIONS https://t.co/dEypVwT1A2

Now, here we are with #Vogtle on the verge of failure, and taxpayers on the cusp of forking over $BILLIONS because the Dep’t of @ENERGY ignored obvious risks in a rush to hand out subsidies.	We tried to tell them for years, but now, saying 'We told you so,' is cold comfort.
And of course, the latest cost increase and turmoil prove how utterly irresponsible and ludicrous it was for DOE to charge the #Vogtle owners NOTHING in credit subsidy cost, suggesting there was negligible risk of the loans going bad.  https://t.co/0mEFuBITsJ
..Congress included an extension/expansion of the Nuclear Production Tax credit in the tax extenders bill this past Feb. The tax credit could potentially net @GeorgiaPower more than $2 billion in subsidies. https://t.co/t8BFNowWbz
And the thing is, the project WAS bailed out: Dep’t of @ENERGY offered $3.7 billion MORE in subsidized (taxpayer-backed) loans to the #Vogtle owners (@GeorgiaPower, @OglethorpePower, and MEAG): https://t.co/MmgO4B07Af	AND…
Have no idea what we’re talking about? Here’s a fact sheet on the $8.3 BILLION in @ENERGY loan guarantees to build 2 nuclear reactors at Plant #Vogtle in Georgia. It's from last year - aka, the last massive cost increase that prompted calls for a bailout	https://t.co/ElaEUY2Yl7

On Tues. @Interior released its new #methane rule. We read all 126 pgs and created a nifty breakdown of its sections and what they do.
We should provide means-tested, accountable, and market-responsive safety nets for those who need them. But we can’t provide eternally soft landing places in a completely avoidable trade war. https://t.co/4zWDSO9UPW

Oil &amp; gas companies reported wasting 216 billion cubic feet of natural gas on federal lands for 2008-'17. More was unreported.	There's NOTHING in the new @BLMNational rule today that will limit future gas waste or make them pay taxpayers for it.	 https://t.co/NwyXvjKWKW

Myth No. 6- Let the markets decide.
Myth No. 5- The biggest uncertainty in farm country is not passing a farm bill on time, it’s the fear (and now reality) of lost markets due to the Trump Administration’s trade war of choice.
Myth No. 4- The 2014 farm bill’s promise of farm safety net savings is not bearing fruit.
Myth No. 3- Farm programs don’t disappear at midnight on September 30. meeting/
Myth No. 2- Taxpayers must keep subsidizing farm businesses if a new $867 billion farm bill doesn’t pass this month.
Myth No. 1-For many farmers, crop prices and farm business income are lower than when the last farm bill was debated in 2013. But that’s because 2010-2014 was the best five year run for agriculture, ever.

How about making Air Force Space Command a Combatant Command like SOCOM?
Plus when Army Air Forces was turned into the Air Force in 1947 it’s not like other services quit their aviation components.
Even if a space force just gets cobbled together from all those other parts of services, Pentagon bureaucracy grows with a new service secy. Also recruiters, communications, HR, Admin, etc.
Newsflash – we already have the Air Force Space Command. Navy &amp; Army already have space-related operation.

The House and Senate passed separate versions of the first 3-bill 'Minibus” appropriations package in June. A VA funding dispute is reportedly halting conference bill negotiations, but the two sides also need to resolve differences in the Energy &amp; Water portions of their bills...
But we’re shooting ourselves in the foot here by bringing back an 83-yo law that shifts losses from ag to taxpayers. And $12B is only the tip of the iceberg.

Page 12- “ This situation—in which debt grows faster than GDP—means the current federal fiscal path is unsustainable.”		And on and on it goes….
Now look at the bottom of page 6: we have $3.5 trillion in assets, $23.9 trillion in total liabilities.
Seriously, pick a page, any page, and read a bit of it.		Read the top of page 6: net operating costs have been higher than budget deficits for the last 5 years (aka, it’s worse than it looks).
Here’s what we’re reading today. You know, it’s almost like we’re on an unsustainable fiscal trajectory that Congress exacerbated by tacking on $2.7 trillion more in projected deficits just in the last six months...	Oh wait, THAT’S EXACTLY WHAT IT'S LIKE! https://t.co/9Ue0w1NYgm

It's not too late for Trump to win on Infrastructure. Here's how: https://t.co/lP2DRK7vUP
3/3 Taxpayers cannot afford a farm bill packed with parochial payouts for special interests. https://t.co/lnb6uwmmj0
2/3 Taxpayers can afford to create a cost-effective, transparent safety net for businesses involved in agriculture. https://t.co/lnb6uwmmj0
1/3 There is even more taxpayer money in crop insurance in 2018 Farm Bill. https://t.co/lnb6uwmmj0
From @taxpayers' sr. policy analyst Joshua Sewell to @ArthurDelaneyHP of @HuffPostPol : “There are some changes to the nutrition programs, and there are no positive changes to the [agricultural] welfare programs.” About says it all. https://t.co/IoydyAH30u
More facts:	-#Pruitt brought the team on personal trips to Disneyland and the Rose Bowl	-EPA spent **&gt;$3 million** on his security team in his first year	-According to the @EPAoig Mr. Pruitt requested the team from Day 1 (https://t.co/NFCna2040p) https://t.co/3s7ctn165B
In hearing right now, Senators are asking EPA Administrator @EPAScottPruitt about his security team. Here are the facts:	-Previous administrators had a 6 person security detail during work hours	- #Pruitt has a 20-person, round-the-clock team	https://t.co/IfUijqqGX1
Whether it’s the $43k soundproof phone booth, the unnecessary lease of a fully loaded Chevy Suburban, the unprecedented security costs, extravagant 1st class travel, or any other spending excess, we hope Senators hold @EPAScottPruitt to account today https://t.co/gp1IoTcatd

New in the #TaxExtenders bill this year: extension/expansion of the nuclear production tax credit (PTC). Apparently 15 yrs to qualify for $6 billion wasn’t enough, so let’s make it indefinite and funnel more to the nuclear industry? Why that's a bad idea: https://t.co/EadNuRIe80

Want to know more about why earmarks don't work? Here's your one stop shop - https://t.co/p08axXVfQy Find all our work there, plus  Steve Ellis' @TaxpayersEllis testimony on the subject this morning.
By having the systems in place, (systems without earmarks) it doesn't matter if you're a republican or democrat, if you're senior or junior... - @TaxpayersEllis
RT @nanswift: "Earmarks are not the embodiment of the 'Power of the Purse." - @TaxpayersEllis  testifies @RulesReps  #NoEarmarks @taxpayers
“The reason I hate earmarks is because they suck everybody in." @TaxpayersEllis quoting then  Appropriations Committee Chairman David Obey
“We would like to see Congress fully exercise the power of the purse and conduct oversight and hold the Executive Branch accountable over the full federal budget, not some small sliver.” @TaxpayersEllis
“Furthermore, the same people who push “the power of the purse” argument often point out that even at their peak, earmarks represented a very small percentage of the total discretionary budget.”  - @TaxpayersEllis
“Also, it is important to note that the annual hunt for earmarks was resource-intensive, absorbing hundreds or even thousands of hours of congressional staff time to develop, obtain, review, and execute the earmarks…” - @TaxpayersEllis
“According to the Congressional Research Service there were roughly 3,000 earmarks in 1996. By 2005 that number exceeded 15,000.3 In the last year of earmarks, fiscal year 2010, there were more than 9,000 – treble the number from only 15 years prior.” - @TaxpayersEllis
“Earmarks served to increase public cynicism about government, smacked of pay-to-play and substituted political muscle for project merit in spending decisions”

Thank you for speaking out against earmarks, @RepMarkWalker @RepTedBudd . We agree. Watch @TaxpayersEllis testify against earmarks to the House Rules Committee.
Bringing back earmarks insults taxpayers, who have passionately expressed their desire for a government that works for them and not special interests.
Instead, congress should focus on creating new criteria &amp; metrics that allocates funding through merit, competitive or formulaic means, while conducting executive oversight.
We already have the ability to rapidly spend money while setting clear priorities, creating standards of eligibility for funding, and/or increasing or decreasing funding to existing programs. It’s called appropriations bills.
The answer is for congress to do the job for which it was elected – do the hard work and write better bills.
Some of our biggest legislative achievements – the civil rights act, the interstate highway system, the tax reform act of 1986 – all passed when earmarks were relatively insignificant.
Fun fact: in the heyday of earmarks, legislative accomplishment took a dip. Know when appropriations bills were last passed on time and through regular order? Before earmarks became the new normal.
Earmarks inspire a pay-to-play system, and picks winners and losers based on political clout, not merit. How is that a fix to congressional dysfunction and the swamp?
If allowed to move forward, @BLMNational’s methane waste rule would ensure royalties are paid on nat. gas vented and flared on federal lands - 90 percent or $880 million of which, was wasted royalty-free 2006-2015. https://t.co/AMpfY2EShQ
.@BLMNational has delayed the implementation dates of key provisions, pushing them back by a year because of “the burden it would place on operators,” when operators currently comply with similar provisions in states like Colorado….
Today marks the one year anniversary of @BLMNational’s methane waste rule. Provisions of the rule, which prevent needless waste of natural gas during energy production on federal lands, would have taken effect today, but…

There was certainly no reason to wait on CHIP or disaster funding until this week. But having the conversation focus on the tax bill meant that disaster funding, for instance, could be rushed through with even more haste.
Close of business – Friday night is the government’s last working business day. Chances are no one wants to work Saturday. We know  everyone wants to be home and not flying home come Christmas Eve, but, we’ve seen one or two day CRs in the past.
Thursday night, the House passed legislation to deal with these issues but unlike the tax bill, all of the matters described above will need 60 votes to pass the Senate.  And that means deal-making.
#PAYGO When the President signs the tax bill, it'll create a daunting new deadline: because the tax package is projected to increase deficits over the next ten years.
#FloodInsurance – this program expired at the end of September but was extended through the first and second CR’s.  Likely that will happen again, since it is set to expire on Friday.
Thing is, the reps of these states and districts waiting for that aid have said they will not vote for the CR if the disaster component is not included.
#DisasterSupplemental The areas hardest hit by this year's natural disasters, have received some immediate aid, but Monday night House appropriators released an $81 billion supplemental spending bill that, in theory, help those communities rebuild.
#CHIPFunding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which covers 9 million kids, lapsed on September 30th. States have been using cash mgmt. strategies to keep the program running. If nothing is done immediately, the well runs dry at the end of January.
The #ContinuingResolution : The government shuts down at midnight Friday if Congress does not pass a new Continuing Resolution.  If that CR goes into 2018, Congress must also address the dreaded automatic, across the board cuts known as sequestration.
#Congress has been clear that its’ top priority was sending a tax bill to @potus before Christmas. This deadline was self-imposed and took attention way from other pressing tasks such as:
Tax Extenders is a big deal. It's the opposite of tax reform. It increases complexity. It reduces predictability. It's drives us to drink but there's a provision on that too. Not cool. https://t.co/ZcrleOg8NT
The Disaster Supplemental  is a classic case of “Haste Makes Waste”. Here's why: https://t.co/o5kL8irsO5

Yesterday, Congress passed the #TaxBill - here's our statement. https://t.co/jaiDhcZJSq
If wage and economic growth hopes for the bill do not pan out, this year's windfall comes with a big future price tag, to be paid from the taxpayer's wallet.
If the administration believes that more debt equals a threat to national security, then this tax bill is bad for American security in addition to taxpayers who fund it.
It’s ironic the President is signing a tax bill guaranteed to expand our debt in the same week his new National Security Strategy warned that the national debt threatens American security.
#TaxReform is about hard choices, and has to be an open, bipartisan process to succeed. Neither has been true of this bill.
Congress has a fiduciary duty to the country as a whole - today they failed that duty.
To say we're disappointed is an understatement.

While Congress is sprinting to the new year, we’re digging into the tax bill. So stay tuned. We’re not taking our eye off the ball.
Congress is planning to add an $81 billion disaster bill to the CR.
Congress must either suspend the “pay-go” rules that kick in as a result of the increase in the deficit in the tax bill...or massive automatic cuts to Medicare and other entitlement reform.
Congress is expected to take up health care bills to stabilize the insurance markets.

Drilling to cut the deficit won’t work. Instead of $1 BILLION, offering 800,000 acres in #ANWR #1002Area for O&amp;G drilling would get less than ONE FIFTH of that, under the MOST generous assumptions https://t.co/X7YkbvJnCU #BadMath, #TaxpayersLose, #ArcticRefuge https://t.co/gLyAWgIhao
To generate $1 billion for budget purposes, leasing 800,000 acres in #1002Area would have to get $2,500/acre. The average in federal onshore lease sales on Alaska's North Slope since 2010 is $22.91/acre ($2016) dollars - i.e. 100X LESS https://t.co/H0Zqicmkp9 #math https://t.co/wFTuKPlK3E
The @lisamurkowski measure authorizes 2 oil and gas lease sales of 400,000 acres each in #1002Area. But they won't raise the expected revenue, and Congress should be looking at serious options to reduce the tax package's $1.5 trillion cost https://t.co/H0ZqicDVgH https://t.co/48TiwxuTX6
This morning, we'll be following the Senate Energy &amp; Natural Resources Committee markup of reconciliation recommendations to open up the #1002 Area in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (#ANWR) to oil and gas drilling https://t.co/H0Zqicmkp9 spoiler: we're skeptical

In @MatthewDalyWDC piece, see our estimate that opening up #1002Area in #ANWR for oil &amp; gas drilling will generate only 1/10 of what @lisamurkowski expects, and that's under generous assumptions! Which means taxpayers will get shorted https://t.co/kMisLDQqQy

@MotherJones 7/7- Bottom line - Congress needs to WANT to work together to be able to actually work together https://t.co/i7h51IlVTi
@MotherJones 6/7- Spending bills passed on time 4 times in more than 40 years. Last time before earmark explosion of mid-2000s
@MotherJones 5/7-So, whether or not we bring back earmarks, there is no evidence that bringing them back will change Congress.
@MotherJones 4/7- Productivity on key bills — appropriations, tax, water resources etc. Has not changed since the moratorium was put into place.
@MotherJones 3/7- 2 water project/policy bills, highway bill, flood ins. reauth, 3 deals on budget caps, omnibus spending bills passed since moratorium
@MotherJones 2/7- In other words, how do you “bribe” someone with what they don’t want, to do something they don’t want to do?
@MotherJones 1/7- Absence of earmarks isn’t the cause of Congressional dysfunction. Many MoCs ran on not compromising, not making deals, not earmarking.

@ENERGY @GeorgiaPower @WECNuclear Instead of rushing to help, @ENERGY needs to stop, put the taxpayer interest 1st, and refuse to bet more on deeply-troubled #Vogtle project.
@ENERGY @GeorgiaPower @WECNuclear SHOCKER, #Vogtle owners turn to @ENERGY for billions more in loan guarantees
@ENERGY @GeorgiaPower @WECNuclear Present Day:	New estimate - #Vogtle is as much as $11 billion over budget, and 6 YEARS behind schedule
@ENERGY @GeorgiaPower March 2017:	#Vogtle contractor @WECNuclear declares bankruptcy
@ENERGY @GeorgiaPower 2015:	MEAG Power gets $1.8 billion in loan guarantees, even though #Vogtle project is 38 months behind schedule, $3 billion over budget
@ENERGY 2014:	@ENERGY finalizes loan guarantees, @GeorgiaPower gets $3.5 billion Oglethorpe Power gets $3.1 billion
@ENERGY 2013:	#Vogtle project to build 2 nuclear reactors is 21 months behind schedule, more than $1 billion over budget

@laraseligman @SecAFOfficial @usairforce You’re right, made correction. But the analysis we linked to in the first tweet stated that we were talking about Combat Aircraft.
@laraseligman @SecAFOfficial @usairforce Correct. But, again, we’re talking about @usairforce Combat Aircraft funding which is $5.3 billion and all F-35.
@laraseligman @SecAFOfficial @usairforce Again, those items are not in the @usairforce Combat Aircraft budget line.
@laraseligman @SecAFOfficial @usairforce Not in the @usairforce Combat Aircraft line. 100% of Combat Aircraft $ is for the F-35. See highlights on budget doc https://t.co/M0mNcp7Et2
