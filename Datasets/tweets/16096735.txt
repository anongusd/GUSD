#TrumpShutdown down the government with @SenMajLdr  bc they want power over you, your community &amp; all working families came to the table, and @realDonaldTrump  walked away from a bipartisan solution that would have given workers a voice and kept worker power. #TrumpShutdown
@SenateMajLdr and @SpeakerRyan  dont want to #SaveTPS because their donors want power over #TPS workers and all workers. Power of employers over #TPS workers weakens @GoIUPAT  and hurts all workers. I will not stand for that #SaveTPS #TrumpShutdown #DreamActNow

@SenMajLdr and @SpeakerRyan dont want to restore #DreamAct because their donors want power over these kids. I will not stand for children being used as a political power play for #TrumpShutdown. #DreamActNow #SaveTPS
#Dreamers children are in the US working legally. When @realDonaldTrump ended #DACA he took away their legal status, giving employers total power over workers. @SenMajLdr  and @SpeakerRyan knew this which is the reason @GOP chose #TrumpShutdown
Workers without legal status are taken advantage of by employers who hold #immigration status over them. This power dynamic lowers working conditions for all workers, and it ONLY benefits greedy employers. We must stand up and fight back. #SaveTPS #DreamActNow
Being able to work in this country legally means that your employer can‚Äôt hold your #immigration status over you. That you can speak up at the workplace, that you can demand better pay and better benefits #1u #EndWageTheft #SaveTPS #DreamActNow
