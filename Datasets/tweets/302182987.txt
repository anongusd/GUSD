@thisisjendoll I envision field mice getting into adventures in fields and making homes out of corn cobs. Regular mice live in used Chinese takeout boxes.

@nanaimostation @Bourdain Well, yeah, for everyone except Helen Mirren, Mr Rodgers, Tom Hanks and...I dunno...Bob Barker, fame looks like a mixed bag.
@HeatherMatarazz I really want to help all these (sadly necessary) gofundme’s. Is there any way of knowing what’s legit? I can only give so much and want to make sure I’m giving to honest cases.
@nanaimostation @Bourdain Sure. Our whole convo is about public perception. Right or wrong, before all this, she was only known as a pornstar to those who even knew her at all. Now, to many, myself included, she’s a pretty dope example of how not to take shit from bullies.

@missmayn Btw, it was only via insomniac-induced boredom a year or so ago that I found the old blog post in your bio. Is there somewhere you have more recent pieces of writing posted?
@beckyhammer You mean to tell me the culturally insensitive heterosexual white male* didn’t have a decent outfit?		*I guessed on these elements but I’m very confident.
@missmayn Wow. What an oddly rare, legitimately touching moment on Twitter. I should probably delete my account right now.
@missmayn Just a humble suggestion that you should use this moment to share that piece you wrote about your abortion. I found it really moving.

@andyaloser @WayneLogan12 @JenAshleyWright @andylassner @ilgop Even republicans who signed it were horrified when they learned who he was and vowed to vote dem. There are real threats to our democracy occurring daily. Learn to rank orders and prioritize your outrage.
@WayneLogan12 @andyaloser @JenAshleyWright @andylassner @ilgop I think it’s a silly precedent to say a party owns all candidates who get on the ballot, even if they work to oppose. Dude needed only 800 signatures.
@WayneLogan12 @andyaloser @JenAshleyWright @andylassner @ilgop I get that point of view. I really do. I just think it’s relevant that they actively took steps to stop the guy from getting on the ballot, which is a stark differentiation from the Roy Moore example.
@erinscafe “Only cucks would let their bitches earn all the glory for defeating the dirty dishes.”
@everywhereist This conversation, brought to you by The Turkey Council.
@andyaloser @JenAshleyWright @andylassner @ilgop I get that argument. Trump’s coziness with white nationalists horrifies me too. I just don’t think this in particular is on them
@JenAshleyWright @andylassner I loathe the GOP, but blaming them for this is unfair. Dude got the signatures. They tried to stop him but couldn’t. Even the @ilgop chairman has publicly called for republicans to vote dem in that race.

@faca90c9c647436 @FoxNews @JoeConchaTV @POTUS @JoeBiden Better. Now to address YOUR “point,” as none of the Trumps have divested from their “businesses” it’s not sacrifice. And not only is is not sacrifice, it’s a blatantly illegal violation of the Emoluments Clause.  Have a great night.

@IslesFanInBkNY @JoeMande @bakedalaska He was a lead organizer of the march that chanted “Jews will not replace us.” Doesn’t take a lot of digging.
@IslesFanInBkNY So im worried about Nazis and a self-hating jew? Well that’s a neat trick. (You’re really bad at this)	(But thanks for your hospice work)
@IslesFanInBkNY @JoeMande @bakedalaska I didn’t say the tweet was anti-Semitic. I said the tweeter was an anti-Semite. An avowed, open one in fact.
@IslesFanInBkNY Probably smart you don’t put your name on this twitter handle. Retweeting Nazis typically isn’t the thing rabbis and employers like to see.
@IslesFanInBkNY @JoeMande How many other neo-nazi white-supremacists do you follow and retweet? Just this one or are there more?
@IslesFanInBkNY @JoeMande  https://t.co/pTjoIrvyju
@IslesFanInBkNY @JoeMande 1) Dawkins was an asshole	2) he’s making a sarcastic point about Trump’s comments and you’re too dense to understand it. Wow, dude. Dense
@IslesFanInBkNY @JoeMande Your Twitter feed says otherwise. I have receipts.
@sarahrainsford @lrozen Always worth rewatching. 		https://t.co/rmtDq1lW24
@IslesFanInBkNY @JoeMande Tell me, Jew-to-jew, why do you follow and retweet anti-semites and neo-Nazis? #whostheselfhatingjewnowbitch?
@IslesFanInBkNY @JoeMande Did you mean to put this in your bio, Alex? Cause if you meant to put this in your bio, you put it in the wrong spot. In the bio.

@TyNordic @DemLibs @FrederickChook @pjialexander @lilh412 @Calebkeeter @AdamLaxalt Smart automobile laws reduced car deaths in America. Didn’t eliminate all, but many. Smart gun laws have done the same elsewhere.
@TyNordic @DemLibs @FrederickChook @pjialexander @lilh412 @Calebkeeter @AdamLaxalt We used to have WAY more car deaths. Now cars are highly regulated. Tests, insurance, seatbelts, registration, fees/jail time for misuse...
@TyNordic @DemLibs @FrederickChook @pjialexander @lilh412 @Calebkeeter @AdamLaxalt Good point. So why bother having laws that make murder a crime? Why bother with speed limits or food safety regulations while we’re at it?

@nickgourevitch Which poll are you referring to?
@nickgourevitch I think you have to simulate the debate as the public is hearing it, not how we wish it was.  Otherwise, can't gauge response strength
@nickgourevitch Polling in general shouldn't matter on this issue. But if polling on this, you have to use his words, no?
@nickgourevitch Sure. Dog whistle, coded and manipulative. But even if gen public doesn't know it, don't u still have to test what the public's hearing?
@JHudsontraffic @craignewman @OHareTowingServ Big delays getting in?
@DanaSchwartzzz Whether satirical or not, go read at all these conversations and look how many white people now think staying home is a principled response
@djkomisar @birbigs Also, if you're following her advice literally it's tough to make the claim that it's satirical.
@djkomisar @birbigs Every bit as Jewish and at risk as your are. Do you really think her sober, direct plea to camera at the end to stay home was satire?
@ilieknachos @birbigs She literally ended it by soberly saying direct to camera, "don't go [protest]"
@LucyCorey @birbigs Lol. Yeah. Encouraging ppl to ignore evil, stay home, eat cake and hide behind at-risk communities is HI-LARIOUS
@1followernodad This primarily a Kimmy Schmidt thing? Haven't watched much of it. But given this SNL clip, I can see her blind spot.
@djkomisar @birbigs Your soul is going to stay home and eat cake while at-risk communities stand up to Nazis on your behalf? Ok.
@birbigs Why is a straight Christian white advocating ppl hide behind at-risk populations rather than speaking out against racists "the greatest?"

@eweiner_bball @evansilva Powell for sure, and I like Forte at his current ADP. He'll produce for a few early weeks until his body breaks again
@eweiner_bball @evansilva Was kinda thinking std in my head and which teams have fewest players going in top 100 picks. Feels like Rams and Jets to me

@Luvvie he's not changing twitter handles.
@jesteinf how the fuck is he still employed? There's more insightful editorials in High School papers.
@joelengel "And it passed along strict party lines." With incredible insight like that it's hard to tell why u haven't gotten that 20th book
@joelengel no one, POTUS included, expected a bill dealing with (I believe) a quarter of the US economy to be perfect on first draft.
.@AmbassadorPower's a brilliant woman who I respect greatly. Also, if you focus out on that picture it looks like the mic is a Hitler stache
@joelengel you know exactly what my point was, but solid deflection there.
@joelengel yeah. And why does the constitution need all those amendments?
@missmayn it's almost as if *gasp* they don't care about people's health, safety or privacy!
@canderson93 @WalshFreedom that is factually incorrect. I encourage you to research that.
@MeganApper @jonlovett @jonfavs the most amazing part is watching Devos' supporters behind her squirm as she's doing terribly.

@elusivepickle @TwitsForMiles @WalshFreedom "we've let way too many people get too many guns for too long. Only answer now is more guns!"
@kirkwschamel @WalshFreedom holy fuck. Please learn how this machine works and then try again. https://t.co/FTYL7U5PqY
@canderson93 @WalshFreedom would work better if Indiana wasn't giving em out like hot cakes. How's high ownership working in AK, LA and MS?

@kirkwschamel @WalshFreedom what the fuck was I supposed to respond to?!?! https://t.co/OoahS7kQ0j
@elisabetta7991 ...dumbass argument.
@elisabetta7991 the next person swayed by a twitter feud will be the first. But I'll consider if a win if we get someone to stop using a...
@banalretort @PreppersMatch @WalshFreedom and we have more guns than any other country on earth. By your logic, why aren't we the safest?
@banalretort @PreppersMatch @WalshFreedom 1) our murder rate isn't even close to tops 2) our guns flood in from IN but its Chicago's fault?!
@PreppersMatch @banalretort @WalshFreedom The dim-witted bully who winds up in shit. Sounds about right.
