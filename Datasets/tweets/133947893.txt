@conorsen Hard to justify why the Braves weren't a player here, given those revenue numbers.
Hot take No. 2: The real losers today, like most days, are the Mets.
Hot take No. 1: It was fun to root for Harper at Nats Park and it will also be fun to root against him there.
@NickRiccardi Even if Harper thinks he'll regress in yrs 11-13, it's hard to imagine that, with baseball inflation what it is, he could not reasonably expect &gt;$10m/yr in those years.
@JimPuzzanghera The owners? Or the team on the field?
And yes, I would have preferred the Dodgers had signed him for $175/5, or whatever.
The psychic value for Harper of setting a record must have really high utility here!
Nats had offered $300m over 10. Seems genuinely weird to me that Harper would leave for an extra $10m/yr at the end of his deal -- to a division rival! -- and it seems just as weird that the Nats didn't go 11 yrs/$331m to keep him. https://t.co/B9b57Hpv32

@RyanLEllis and then on top of that, you have the sustained supply side effects that get you to 3%/yr
@RyanLEllis I don't get into huge detail on it in the piece, but that middle ground is *basically* where the WH baseline projection is. It sees the slow post-recession growth as largely cyclical/recession hangover, and thus higher trend growth to come.
Bonus list: Ronald Reagan was the last U.S. president to rally from an approval rate ~40% (like Trump now) at the start of Year 3 of his first term, then win re-election. Here are the quarterly real GDP growth rates for the start of his 3rd yr - re-elect vote. https://t.co/FgyWzGH5WZ
Bottom line: the Trump administration is way more optimistic about growth this year than CBO, Fed and others. The big driver of growth *might* be the outside force of oil prices. And whether Team Trump is correct could really matter for 2020:		https://t.co/j8Bbmz1yIp 8/
@USCBO MEANWHILE, economists on @KentSmetters' team say the reason for the growth surge last year had more to do with oil prices than tax cuts, because oil is such a huge driver of American investment now. Which would be bad news for growth this yr, bc prices have dropped. 7/ https://t.co/t2zmNAoS0S
@USCBO As Kevin Hassett, the chief WH economist, put it to me: “Last year looked just like we thought, so we don’t think, going into our next forecast, that there’s a heck of a lot of reason to change our mind about things." 6/
@USCBO CBO, the Fed and others see ~2.3% growth this year, because stimulus is fading and the global economy (incl trade war) is a headwind		WH sees ... 3% growth. 5/
@USCBO Now we come to Year 2 of the tax cuts, and the forecasts diverge.		And so we start finding out who is right. 4/
@USCBO The similarity of the projections hid the very different way the forecasters view the US economy. 		CBO sees a baseline long run growth rate of ~1.7%, boosted last yr by fiscal stimulus		WH sees a higher baseline, further boosted by supply-side effects of tax cuts/deregulation 3/
Last year, after the passage of President Trump's signature tax cuts -- and a bipartisan bill to boost defense and other fed spending -- the White House projected 3.1% growth for 2018. @USCBO projected 3.3%. We don't have final numbers yet, but it's looks like they were ~right 2/

@AndySwan @OphirGottlieb That's a totally valid argument -- cut taxes, stoke growth, don't worry about the extra deficit.		It isn't the argument Republicans made for the bill.
Important disclaimer that JCT (and other) dynamic models predict higher revenue feedbacks from growth in the coming years. (Though JCT scored the bill, dynamically, as a $1 trillion revenue loss)
And that's before adjusting for inflation. And it's just comparing revenue levels -- when the correct comparison is to revenue projections. Either of those adjustments make the picture look worse.
As recently as this fall, Republicans were claiming that tax cuts paid for themselves, because tax revenues increased. 		They didn't.
We now know the full extent of tax receipts for calendar year 2018, the first year the Trump Tax Cuts were fully in place.		Receipts FELL by 1 percent, even though economic growth accelerated. https://t.co/lw1dg1tIgR
Allow me one more chart on this.

In fact @Susan_Athey just cited engineering firms as an example of *more supportive* environments for women than Econ. https://t.co/69bRlfkecL
Make no mistake: There’s a lot of that in Econ.
“Aggressiveness” — a word this panel keeps bringing up — is more or less a polite way of saying, male economists being assholes to women.
Yellen says “the aggressiveness of the profession, as exemplified in seminars, is something that discourages women from going into the field...it’s something we need to work hard to change.”
“Feminism kind of died out” by the 1980s, Janet Yellen says this morning at #ASSA2019, as part of an explanation for why progress for women in Econ has stalled. But, she says, “What’s hopeful is I see another wave of feminism that’s been roused by the MeToo movement.”
“In that context, the best way forward was to suggest to Roland Fryer that he resign”
The outgoing AEA President, Olivier Blanchard, just said for the first time that the committee asked Dr. Fryer to resign — in part because it has no means in its bylaws to remove someone.
Some Roland Fryer news from the AEA biz meeting. @jenniferdoleac asked why the committee has not said more about Fryer’s resignation from the executive committee amid his sexual harassment investigation at Harvard: “The silence from the executive committee has been deafening”

And also watching the thought leaders in their field, especially those who were so vocal about the need for a code of conduct. (fin)
If social media and my inbox are any indication, a lot of economists - particularly women - will be watching what AEA does now, closely.
To repeat from our story, a Harvard investigator has now found six instances where Prof. Fryer created a hostile work environment for women. At least one other investigation is ongoing.
A spokesman for Janet Yellen, who was elected president-elect of AEA on the same ballot as Prof. Fryer, told me that Chairwoman Yellen had been 'completely ignorant' of concerns related to Prof. Fryer, until a reporter asked about them.
Prof. Fryer won his election well after the Harvard Crimson first broke news of the investigation at Harvard.		AEA leadership never asked him, even then, abt the allegations, Blanchard told me. They left the investigation to Harvard and said they would wait for conclusions.
Also in the spring, an AEA committee recommended Prof. Fryer for election to its executive board, which he went on to win. The AEA president, Olivier Blanchard, told me he wished the committee had known abt the investigation into Fryer at that time, but it didn't.
In April, the American Economic Association approved a 'code of conduct' for its members. It states: "Economists have both an individual responsibility for their own conduct, and a collective responsibility to promote professional conduct" -- including equal opp. https://t.co/Bi9SWBDQIB

The reason so few folks see a SALT-related increase is that the law includes other cuts that help SALT-claiming filers, including weakening the AMT.

@WhittyMike @sahilkapur @jaketapper As the sections you highlight note, spending is *down* as a share of GDP. Revenues are also down -- by much more -- as a share of GDP. You can argue that gov spends too much, but that's a diff arg from whether tax cuts reduce federal revenue from what it would have been otherwise
@WhittyMike @sahilkapur @jaketapper ...so it's not correct to say that, because revenues slightly increased, that shows tax cuts paid for themselves. 	Also, when judging year over year -- which captures effects of tax cuts better than fiscal year, bc cuts mostly took effect in Jan -- revenues are slightly down
@WhittyMike @sahilkapur @jaketapper The idea that tax cuts would 'pay for themselves' is judged against a baseline: Would they raise as much revenue as previously forecast, before the tax cuts?

@StephanieKelton That was not an argument that supporters of the tax cuts made! (The argument was, they'll pay for themselves. Or, in some cases, they'll mostly pay for themselves, and then we'll cut spending, which is the real problem.)
Yes, tax revenues grew in FY2018. But they grew by less than inflation, and by far less than in previous years when growth was much weaker. 	FY '18 revenue growth: 0.4% 	FY '16 (W/ much weaker GDP growth): 0.5%	FY '15 (W/ solid GDP growth): 7.5%
You may recall that many Republicans said their tax cuts would "pay for themselves" through increased growth/revenues. In the first nine months, they are not -- by any measure. https://t.co/N8H8Gjr3a5

@TPCarney @RyanLEllis Here is the full list of questions they used to construct the model. I would be curious if you find any of them to be gauges of "sexism": https://t.co/4tGJxeXM7P
@tonybalogna @RyanLEllis Respectfully, 1) none of the researchers is from a New York school and 2) the study is not behaviorally prescriptive. It is an attempt to explain why wage/employment gaps are so varied, and so persistent, across people and places.
@RyanLEllis Important to note that the research finds those "sexist" attitudes are receding across the country, but that gaps in attitudes between states remain basically constant.
@RyanLEllis That certainly is a judgment call the researchers have made here, on what attitudes to call "sexist".
@RyanLEllis There are eight questions from the GSS that researchers use to define sexist. Full list is in appendix to paper but here's their summary: https://t.co/HTCenGBZzb
Women earn less and work less if:	*They are born in a more sexist part of America (even if they leave)	*They move, as adults, to a place where the men around them are more sexist (a straight-up discrimination effect)	Important new research:	https://t.co/YraSRIKnBh

@NelsonDaleSmith @bencasselman @nberpubs That's not the only effect the research finds. It also finds that women who grow up in more sexist areas earn less compared to men from those areas, even when they both move elsewhere as adults.  (It also finds that men in more sexist areas pay women less.)

Sen. Donnelly of Indiana just asked Powell to speak directly to the farmers in his state. (The ones watching CSPAN, I guess)
@MarcGoldwein Several red- or purple-state Dems have expressed similar sentiments.
@MarcGoldwein Joe Donnelly, just now: “Mr. Powell, I’m worried about farmers in my state.”
Trade and wages. Wages and trade. (Democrats)		Growth! (Republicans)		This hearing just previewed your midterm economic messaging.
Only real conflict of this hearing thus far.
Sen. Warren really laying into Powell right now over Fed not 'flunking' banks in stress tests.
Honestly next time the committee should think about letting Powell bring some paperwork or a Game Boy or something to do while senators talk at him about the economy.
I did not mean to live tweet this hearing but here we are.
I love when monetary policy hearings start to play like talk radio and/or social science panel discussions. "Mr. Chairman, I have a question -- a question and a comment -- well, more of a comment..."
Powell on Fannie/Freddie: “It’s really important for the longer run that we get the housing finance system off the government’s balance sheet”
Striking to the degree that Powell:	a) Presents possible trade war outcomes symmetrically (Trump might get a bunch of tariffs down! Or not)	b) That no senator has yet asked him which outcome he sees as more likely
Powell now giving a very Goldin/Katz answer to Bob Corker's question about why wages have stagnated.		Also says weak investment over last few years "cast a shadow over productivity"
@RichardRubinDC A true Take Machine would be incredibly productivity-enhancing and I support its development.
Basically this hearing so far is:	-Republicans trying to get Powell to say nice things about tax cuts.	-Democrats trying to get him to say not-nice things about tax cuts.	-Hand-wringing about trade.
But now Powell says "yes" GDP growth was likely affected by tax cuts -- both this year and last year (in anticipation of cuts).
RT @NickTimiraos: Q to Powell: "Do you think the European Union is a foe" of the United States?	Powell: "No, I do not."
This seems to be a direct contradiction of GOP talking points that law is already boosting wage growth. (Answer was in response to a question about tax law affecting wages)
Powell on the tax cuts: “I think it would be early to look for a bill that was signed into law less than a year ago to be affecting much of anything.”
This may be as scalding as you get from Powell on trade today: Historically speaking, “Countries that have gone in a protectionist direction have done worse”

@PostScottWilson Not as good as Democracy Dies in Sweatpants, I agree!
(To be clear, Nevada took advantage of that policy in order to substitute a county that is at the very very very edge of qualifying for OppZone status -- a county with a median income well above the nation's -- at the expense of a much poorer county.)
@damianpaletta But Treasury does not, at least as far as I can tell based on my math from two different sets of ACS data (fun!), appear to have changed its policy in regards to which tracts are eligible for designation. It appears to have followed the guidance set out in Feb. fin/
Getting Treasury to recognize that change appears to have been the subject of a huge lobbying effort, as @damianpaletta reports so well here: https://t.co/a5VDDhxrwQ 8/
Tl;dr: Storey County, Nevada, did not meet the criteria for an adjacent OppZone based on the 11-15 data. But it does -- juuuuuuust barely -- based on 12-16 data. Its median income fell just enough that it was, by a few hundred dollars, w/in 125% of an adjacent distressed tract 7/
Stick with me here. 		The numbers in the formula rely, as a base case, on 2011-15 ACS (Census) data. But in February, the IRS issued guidance that said states COULD nominate zones based on 2012-16 ACS data: https://t.co/ylyDvI1kao
There are two ways you can satisfy the formula. You can meet the distress definition (most counties) or you can be right next to a distressed county, with a median income, in your county, that is &lt;125% of the distressed county's median income. 5/
Reminder: Opportunity Zone designations are meant to helped *distressed* communities. But the Feds have to determine what distressed means. So they have a formula. They lay that formula out in IRS guidance. 3/
(No one is going to share this thread but it's wonk-portant.) 2/
OK, I've now done the math on Storey County, Nevada's newest opportunity zone. My quoted tweet, here, is incorrect. I'm going to correct it in a stream. Treasury didn't change the OppZone rules. Nevada officials took advantage of rules already on the books. 1/ https://t.co/4qH0riaDG7
That's exactly what happened with Storey Co, Nevada. They shifted to 2012-16 ACS data. https://t.co/0UkCa2mRgN
Also worth noting that February IRS guidance on OppZones gives Treasury leeway to approve designations of counties that were ineligible based on 11-15 ACS data, but eligible based on 12-16: https://t.co/V1oFbMkOvF https://t.co/8fyzvhdbEU
...And it's notable that this came at the very end of the designation process. We saw the opposite in the early designations: Some really suspect choices (Stanford campus!) that were reversed by states before final list.

@SurveyMonkey There are other new and interesting findings that @bencasselman and I write up, including the number of Democrats who give Trump credit for the economy's performance. Read all about it! https://t.co/Xt05KmmlSt
@SurveyMonkey Basically no one claims the cuts will reduce the deficit outside of Trump admin officials. But Republican voters are most likely to take their word for it.
@SurveyMonkey A plurality of Republicans say the tax cuts will *reduce* the federal budget deficit. 		Barely 1 in 5 say they will add to the deficit.		*Most independent analyses conclude the cuts will add at least $1 trillion to deficits over 10 yrs, after accounting for add'l econ growth. https://t.co/ErKW2yFj6o
@SurveyMonkey This next one is kinda wild.
@SurveyMonkey We can't say for sure, but it looks like the law coincides with a surge of Republicans saying they're better off now than a year ago, economically. If you were a GOP base voter who doesn't love Trump and/or this Congress, that might be a reason to turn out in November.
@SurveyMonkey But we also see in this month's data that the law appears to have done something important to Republicans: It's made them feel better about the economy. https://t.co/ciTgfyR2jv
Per new (and ongoing, monthly) @SurveyMonkey / NYT polls, there are really two ways to look at the politics of the Trump tax cuts right now. First, they don't seem to move a lot of voters into the GOP column: Support has stalled just under 50%, and they're underwater w/ indys.

@arappeport But in this administration, economic advisers have insisted the Trump trade agenda -- which includes tariffs -- will boost growth, because it will force *other countries* to reduce tariffs. In which case, the US tariffs would be gone, no harm to growth. IF it works out that way.
@arappeport The analysis is from the Council of Economic Advisers, which historically produces many internal-only assessments of policies. It's unsurprising, in one sense: Nearly all economists agree tariffs hurt growth.

I think about that talk, those insights, frequently. At the time I was a writer who saw reporting as a means to an end. I've since grown to love reporting, as truly the best fuel for writing. I'm in great debt to Mr. Wolfe for helping me see that. 11/

We talked for about an hour, and then walked back to his car. I called my dad. I just spent an hour with Tom Wolfe! "That's great!" he said. "Maybe." 9/
At the time, I thought the lesson there was 'be patient', which it sort of was. But also, the lesson is, sometimes you need to spend hours and hours building trust and learning from someone to get the key insight you need for your story. 8/
While I could, I asked him about interviewing, about writing, about anything I could think to about reporting. He told me he once conducted something like a 7-hr interview just to get one quote. 7/
(Only later did I realize that the shift indicated he figured he'd gotten everything interesting that I knew out of me in like 30 minutes) 6/
Halfway through the interview, he leaned back in his seat and ... I'm not sure how to say this ... relinquished control of the interview. He started letting me ask questions of him. It was a sea change, and he allowed it. 5/
He showed up for that coffee in a huge car, in his signature white suit coat. We walked to the CoHo, sat down, and he started asking questions. A few were about college journalism. Many were about dorm life. Dating, hook ups, social scene. I was ... puzzled. 4/
The professor, Ted Glasser, introduced us. Wolfe said he'd actually been meaning to call me, because I was the editor of the student paper. He invited me to coffee. I was ecstatic. 3/
I was a junior in college when Tom Wolfe spent a few months on our campus, researching what would turn out to be "I am Charlotte Simmons". I was in a journalism class, and one day, Wolfe was a surprise guest speaker. Star-struck, I asked the prof after for an introduction. 2/

Of course, that's not the argument Republicans made earlier this decade, when Obama was in office, when we nearly had a debt ceiling crisis over spending/borrowing: https://t.co/X4IjRxDAzE 10/(fin)
So, the argument goes, while GOP waits for right moment to solve 'real' debt prob, it's ok to cut deals to boost military spending. 9/
And of course, no one really wants to 'exercise' -- to cut safety net spending -- because it's unpopular, and Trump, in particular, is giving the GOP no cover for it. 8/
This is a bit like saying, only regular exercise will keep America from having a fatal heart attack, so, you know, it's ok to eat a few more hamburgers now. 7/
Rebuttal is, only safety net spending matters for debt. Not tax cuts, not even discretionary spending, military or no. The driver of future debt is Medicare/Social Security/etc, and so, yeah, it's not great to add to deficits w/ tax cuts or disc spending, but it's not awful 6/
Now let's talk briefly about the GOP rebuttal. I heard it repeatedly from top conservatives reporting this piece. Here goes... 5/
Republicans' actions today -- as opposed to their fiscal-restraint rhetoric -- look a lot more like George W. Bush era economics than Tea Party economics. I wrote an analysis piece on that: https://t.co/UiJ4UC5siw 4/
Now, in control of DC, the GOP is running up spending and swelling the deficit (via spending and tax cuts). Policy uncertainty has jumped 25% from Obama's 2nd term. 3/
Those pillars, which have dominated Republican economic messaging since the financial crisis, include several 'policy errors' that restrain growth. Among them:	*High taxes/regulations	*Too much gov spenidng	*Too much deficit/debt	*Policy 'uncertainty' 2/
Quick thread on how D.C. Republicans have effectively abandoned most of the pillars of Tea Party economics -- a story that is bigger than just 'deficits'. 1/

I still think they're worth attention from politicians, to be clear.
@HotlineJosh (I remember this. I think I am the only one.)
@HotlineJosh Didn't work that well as a Romney '12 strategy. Remember how he was going to consolidate all fed skills training into a single program? https://t.co/eQRhpGv3sJ
@HotlineJosh @CahnEmily @tamarakeithNPR 3. The idea that Trump was 'smart' to mention the issue in passing in SOTU is ... hard to defend, unless you are also willing to give HRC/Obama/Jeb/Romney/etc 'smart' points for their attention to the issue.

@jleibenluft @StevenTDennis Fact check: Not in any sense true. (You can't count gross tax cuts without also counting offsetting tax increases.)

@Amanda_Kass @rmc031 It is ... not very clearly explained in the bill.
@Amanda_Kass @rmc031 To directly answer your question: You can still get a 15% tax break on your original unrealized cap gain, if you hold that gain in an Opp Fund investment for 7 yrs, even if that Opp Fund investment yields no return
@Amanda_Kass @rmc031 It's both
@Amanda_Kass @rmc031 And if the Opp Fund investment is held 10+ years, the gains on THAT investment (diff from original rolled over cap gain) are tax free
@Amanda_Kass @rmc031 It's a good question -- it's confusing. The rolled over unrealized cap gain gets a 15% cap gains tax break IF investor keeps it in Opportunity Fund for 7+yrs
@mksheikh @rmc031 Engaging with substantive criticism of your work is a crucial part of this gig!
@rmc031 @MikeElk The distinction I draw here is that these aren't subsidies/breaks for relocating companies -- they're for investors in funds that invest in biz/real estate in those areas. Small but crucial difference, imho.
@rmc031 And finally, I'll be keeping an eye on how all this plays out over the months/years to come. I've been writing abt distressed communities, in one way or another, for as long as I've been a full-time reporter, and have no plans to stop.
@rmc031 The zones also don't come with a human capital strategy, per se, though states would be smart to pair zone designations with such strategies.
@rmc031 ...but they acknowledge there's a poss that the zones could fail to provide a sufficient incentive to move capital, esp since they require patience from investors to pay off.
@rmc031 First, it's true that place-based tax incentives have not delivered the results proponents have hoped for in the past. The folks behind Opp Zones, Rs and Ds alike, believe there is more upside potential to this idea, bc there is effectively no cap on $ it could leverage...
This is a fair and measured @rmc031 critique of my piece yesterday. It's worth your time: https://t.co/PzEWeQVzW7		It also raises a couple of points worth discussing abt Opportunity Zones.
@MikeElk @rmc031 I appreciate the tweet (and the critique, which raises fair points abt the literature on past efforts, something I did touch on in the piece). But the provision in question provides no tax subsidies to companies that locate in distressed areas.

"if it’s successful," @WhiteHouseCEA chair Hassett says, "we’ll look back 10 years from now and say this was one of the most important parts of the tax bill, and one we didn’t talk nearly enough about.” 7/

It's the brainchild of Sean Parker (Napster, Facebook Sean Parker) &amp; @InnovateEconomy. tl;dr it's an attempt to roll unrealized cap gains into funds that invest in distressed areas. 5/
The provision creates "Opportunity Zones" in distressed parts of America, urban/rural/suburban. It uses tax incentives to try to lure investment to those areas. 4/
It's a targeted attempt to help the *vast swaths* of the country that haven't risen with the tide of the recovery from the Great Recession. 3/
The bill was basically sold on a 'rising tide/all boats' theory -- that it would create investment and growth that would lift incomes across the board. This provision is different. 2/

@AlanMCole @RichardRubinDC Worth noting that this weekend at AEA, Hassett said repeatedly that CTC expansion was a huge driver of 'cost' of the bill -- not mentioning rev gains from eliminating personal exemptions.
@RichardRubinDC @AlanMCole 😤?
@jleibenluft This is what I get for going on vacation / actually sleeping, after the bill was signed.

But maybe it's a typo! 		We've asked.		We'll report back.
Suffice to say, it's incredibly misleading to only mention one half of this equation. If I cut your income tax rates but also eliminate some deductions you use, what matters to you is the net tax cut
It turns out the gross calculation -- the amount of tax cuts if you don't include the revenue raisers at all -- is $5.5 trillion.
That was a net calculation on a static basis -- total tax cuts, offset by total revenue raisers (from new taxes and eliminated tax breaks)
Regular followers of this account will recall that the tax bill was usually described as a $1.5 trillion tax cut.
There's either a typo in Trump's remarks as prepared for delivery at the Farm Bureau convention -- or a heck of a messaging shift on the tax bill. (Emphasis mine). https://t.co/rLZLNYbSfq

@ojessen None picked. Tho I was in back of room so can't say how questioners were chosen.
That's a stark contrast to Hassett, obvs.
MIT's Kristin Forbes: “We probably shouldn’t expect a big increase in investment and jobs from these repatriated earnings" from the tax bill.
Kristin Forbes of MIT -- 1st panelist -- just said when this panel was dreamed up, expectation was tax reform would not have passed(!)
Moderator took several questions for Hassett, none of them from women. Notable for a conference where gender representation in econ has been a running concern/discussion.
@marthagimbel @JedKolko And we aren't even into the discussion yet!
Hassett now really artfully dodging the "what is the worst part of the bill" question: "I don't want to pick one bad thing"
"Your first sentence should be a question," our moderator tells the audience, "and you shouldn't have a second sentence."		I am totally stealing this line.
For example, they could have passed a budget allowing a larger net tax cut than $1.5 trillion. 		Or they could have reduced the corporate rate by less than they did. 		Or...
Hassett has now said, several times, that the only reason provisions expire in the tax law is bc Dems wouldn't sign on.		Fair to note: There were plenty of ways GOP could have passed a larger, all-permanent bill through reconciliation, w/ 51 votes.
@Noahpinion https://t.co/WEchnWbl61
@owengood Amazing
Also Hassett just called Glenn Hubbard an 'old-timer,' and Hubbard seemed unfazed
I will note that Hassett is basically giving his same presentation from this morning, and that @Austan_Goolsbee arrived late to his own panel. (By one min)
We've got another Hassett/Furman showdown now, w others tossed into the mix too. It's a packed room and I see a million Twitter-ers here so I will only lightly tweet the show...
@Austan_Goolsbee Here early, even.
I think Hassett just obliquely linked Schumpeter and Sen. Ron Johnson and my mind is kind of blown.
Furman has taken more subtle digs at Hassett than vice versa. He just packed a series of them into a response, all basically accusing the tax bill of revenue recklessness.
Also just said 2/3 of the dynamic revenue loss is from expanded child credit -- does not mention lost exemptions that the credit helps replace
Hassett blames Dems for expiring expensing provision in the bill: "The stuff would have been permanent if there had been a few Democratic votes"
@MattHJensen @jasonfurman @aparnamath @BloombergBNA Hassett just gave this a shout out: "I was gratified to see Jason using my own software to disagree w me"
On the upside, Auerbach says the bill will discourage transfer pricing by multinationals
He says some biz provisions "make no sense", including change in treatment of R&amp;D in late years and change inner operating loss provisions.
'Bad news' includes, per AA:	*Big revenue loss	*Passthrough provision (he says you shouldn't do a tax policy that needs 'guardrails')	*Lack of border adjustment
"There's some good news and a lot of bad news" in the new tax law, Auerbach says.
Auerbach says "ultimately where we're going" is toward a consumption (VAT) tax, with lower employment taxes.

And now we get Alan Auerbach to sort all this out for us. 		I feel like @newsbysamuels watching the figure skating finals right now!
Hassett, in a nutshell: The growth effects are likely to be quite large.
Furman, in a nutshell: If you model the full bill, as written, the growth effects are small.
Furman is now having fun with rising marginal tax rates over time (due to the expiring expensing provisions of the bill) https://t.co/TzGAwNko5o

You can imagine these are the ppl who complain to, say, POTUS and the Treasury Secretary abt their taxes going up. BUT! They're still dwarfed by the 0.1%ers getting a big tax *cut*.
But second, it shows 16% of the top 0.1% gets a tax increase in Y1. And it's a BIG tax increase. 3/
First, it shows that among quintiles, middle class / upper MC Americans are mostly likely to see a tax increase in Y1 under the tax bill. 2/

(Tax Foundation has not yet released an analysis of the amended Senate bill; it has only analyzed the version w/o sunsets on indiv tax provisions)
PS -- There's a good/fair/important debate on which economic models to use for dynamic scoring. But all three major models of the Senate bill post-committee (JCT, TPC, Penn) found at least $1T add't deficits
14. In retrospect, JCT score gave one Republican (Corker) serious pause. But it appears to have rallied other Republicans to the belief that the fix was in w/ scorekeepers: https://t.co/s1jlRKnLf9
13. The closing line of the response points essentially allows senators to imagine the cuts could be revenue-positive: "Forecasts made by JCT and CBO, and models based on those forecasts, can be off to the tune of more than $1.5 trillion over ten years"
12. Waving off or attacking JCT became the GOP line, quickly. Mitch McConnell said the cuts would pay for themselves. Tim Scott said JCT has been 'consistently underestimating' growth.
11a. (That better score reflected the fact that Camp's bill was revenue neutral on a static basis)
11. One of their arguments was that JCT had given Dave Camp's bill a much better growth score -- so this score MUST be wrong.
10. So the GOP attacked JCT -- on timing, on findings, on assumptions in its model. A set of 'response points' they circulated said "JCT has a history of poor economic modeling that has consistently underestimated economic growth from tax reform."
9. To many Republicans, this felt like deja vu -- they had felt burned by CBO's scoring of the health care bill. Here, again, was a scorekeeper contradicting what they expected on their bill.
8. But JCT found much less growth than GOP senators had been told, by conservative economists, that a good tax bill could produce -- plus, $1T in add'l deficits
7. After the House passed its version before JCT could finish its score, the JCT chief of staff told his team to focus on a Senate score. They produced one -- just in time.
6. But we never saw a JCT dynamic analysis until Thursday, the day the Senate was supposed to vote. That's bc of how fast GOP has moved the bills.
5. Throughout the tax debate this yr Republicans and Dems alike have pointed to JCT static tables to make arguments in the debate.
4. Some economists, most notably Tax Foundation, have critiqued JCT model for how it typically projects growth from tax cuts
3. Republicans were well acquainted w/ JCT's models: https://t.co/9kUrxv91Xr	and they largely praised its work: "The people who prepare our cost estimates are the best in the business"
2. In 2015, Republicans changed the rules in Congress to mandate dynamic scoring of major bills. For tax bills, that meant JCT, which had been doing dynamic analysis for years.
1. Quick backstory on how Republicans waged a quick and effective war on their economic scorekeeper last week in the Senate.

@owengood The purpose is to explain why this vote went down so smoothly for a divided Republican caucus, my friend. They are united in this belief.
There was also a big departure here. Republicans spent a decade warning abt federal debt. Today, they shrugged off analyses that projected an additional $1T in deficits.
And by that formulation, the relative lack of drama Friday/early Sat was unsurprising.
This was a business-focused, supply side tax bill that bet big on the idea that corporate tax cuts unleash growth. Say what you will: That is a mainstream Republican formulation.

Smetters says this would be very hard with the current tax bill. His model projects the bill will incr growth by 0.08%/yr, at most. 9/
Smetters, a conservative economist, finds that to offset a $1.5T tax cut, you actually need 0.57%/yr in additional growth. 		That is more than 40% more of a growth increase than Republicans are saying we need. 8/
This point of insight comes from Kent Smetters of the Penn-Wharton model, ex-GWB econ adviser. 7/
Tl;dr -- 0.4% is ~what you need to finance a $1.5T tax cut under the current code. But if we cut taxes, we won't have the current code. The new code will raise less $ in fed revenue per additional point of GDP growth than the old one.
But there's really good reason to think that number is too low. 5/
McConnell, Thune, the US Chamber -- a lot of supporters of the bill say 0.4%/yr will do the pay-for-itself trick, or close enough. 4/
What they've done instead is adopt a new favorite number -- a ballpark estimate of the increase you need in GDP growth to finance a $1.5T tax cut. 		That number is 0.4%/yr . 3/
Despite many promises along the way, Republicans haven't produced an analysis of the House or Senate bills that suggests they will pay for themselves. See also: @arappeport https://t.co/NeuXv6ewYe 2/

@Schneider_CM This deserves a more in depth convo but I need to write now -- jim.tankersley@nytimes.com, I'd enjoy continuing the discussion.
@Brian_Riedl @Schneider_CM ...complaining that our coverage does not comport to their opinion on the bill.
@Brian_Riedl @Schneider_CM I think news reporters should strive to represent the full breadth of the analyses on these bills, and I appreciate you both engaging on that. As you might imagine, I get a lot of hate mail from liberals/conservatives rn...
@Schneider_CM I think you raise a fair point here, btw, on the narrow issue of 'cumulative effect'.
@Schneider_CM (That line, btw, was specifically to make a point about who benefits from the bill in the out years)
@Schneider_CM How is that not an appropriate characterization of the findings?
@Schneider_CM ...in large part because we should hold those in power accountable to their promises, and the president has promised everyone is getting a tax cut in this bill except for the rich. Which isn't true.
@Schneider_CM I can't speak for everyone else, but that's not how we've approached coverage of the bill. I do think it's appropriate to point out, in particular, how many taxpayers would see tax increases right away...
@Schneider_CM More to the point: NYT and others have done careful modeling work on this bill and reported its results faithfully. So, no, 'all these analyses' do not cite 2027 tables.
@Schneider_CM Is it irresponsible to point out the millions of middle class families who would immediately/permanently see tax increases? Serious question.
RT @ernietedeschi: How is it "clear" without a dynamic analysis from Congress' own independent economists? https://t.co/XbkkBEUuIp
Very much worth noting that you can have a positive economic effect *and* much higher deficits. 		And also that Republicans have argued for  years that high deficits/debt were the No. 1 drag on the economy.
McCain, on why he's a yes on the tax bill: "I take seriously the concerns some of my Senate colleagues have raised about the impact of this bill on the deficit. However, it’s clear this bill’s net effect on our economy would be positive."

RT @AlexParkerDC: There's a little bit of truth to this. https://t.co/TgFkzP7cr1
Trump straight up just said companies have stopped offshoring profits/etc in anticipation of the tax bill.
Trump goes off message (sort of) to lament difficulty of eliminating estate tax for the rich: 	“I see people here – they’re obviously very rich and they love their children.”
"I'm driving up their stock" Trump says of bankers, many of whom he says he doesn't like. "Anyone could do their jobs...we're making it easy for them"
“I keep hearing Schumer, 'this is for the wealthy'. Well, if it is, my friends don’t know about it.”
On Q3 GDP, Trump: “We would have been at 4 percent, maybe over 4 percent, but we had hurricanes.”
Trump is having fun today on stage. Extended swoon bit on trade deals. Riff on Lewis &amp; Clark history. And of course: "There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished."
Trump just said we haven't had tax cuts "since Reagan."		Did I hallucinate the George W. Bush era?
Good news folks, the president just fixed this: "I told you that we would be saying Merry Christmas again."

That's in part bc of JCT model, in part bc of choice to assume aggressive Fed response to tax cuts.
