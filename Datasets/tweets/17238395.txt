@alexboz Well, Sierra Club and LCV's state chapters certainly worked to defeat it in 2016 because it was revenue neutral. They wanted the funds to go to a menu of progressive causes, most of which were not germane to clean energy, but would help strengthen the progressive coalition.

@SciFiClimateGuy We're hearing from DOE that we're close on fusion, but there seems to be some great small scale models that should pass proof of concept in next few years. DOE and @ARPAE are doing some things we'll think were impossible.
@SciFiClimateGuy The fundamental question is: do you want to solve GHG and climate change? If so, are you willing to wait another 40-50 years before solar and wind scales up, and battery technology gets to where it needs to go, or do you want nuclear in the mix, too?
@SciFiClimateGuy Under current regulatory structure. The timeline to operational ability is the killer, Many ways to skin that cat.   Solar and wind provided 10% of US energy last month...that's a pretty hefty cost per subsidy dollar, too. Don't get us wrong...we're big supporters of renewables..
@SciFiClimateGuy *recycling.   We encourage to seek out Dr. James Hansen's writing on the topic of the necessity of nuclear power, and to follow some of the folks we've retweeted. Eliminating emissions...at scale...is going to require keeping existing nuke on line and R&amp;D for new, small scale.
@SciFiClimateGuy Recylcing or decommissioning batteries is a nasty business, too. There are other options (pumped storage for ex) that don't require chemical batteries.  The big benefit of solar is distributed energy...not reliant on a grid...it's a powerful story and reason to support solar.
@SciFiClimateGuy No one has discussed what we're going to do with all the batteries planned to store solar and wind for night or calm wind periods. The batteries Elon Musk has arrayed in just one site take up more space than all current spent nuke fuel.  cont
@SciFiClimateGuy Not at all. But, scaling up on wind and solar is going to take a long, long time. And both have steep environmental downsides, too. (Look into the nat resources that go in solar mfg). Right now, spent nuclear fuel would cover a football field about 15 feet deep. cont
@SciFiClimateGuy If we reprocess spent fuel, we can reduce the current waste by 90% and have enough nuclear fuel to power plants for a century.  New gen nuclear, too, is already close to a VW Beetle sized reactor that could be encased in concrete, power a city of 20,000 for 25 years.

@RebeccaEWebber @republicEn *Sierra Club and LCV.   Anyway, R's are ready, able, and willing to tackle the tough problems...but they need enviro groups and their voters to "cover their backs".  So far, enviro groups seem to put environment in backseat to non-germane issues.
@RebeccaEWebber @republicEn We met with a group of well known R's this week. The tension between keeping base voters happy and doing good work on enviro issues is real.  Enviro groups don't reward them for tackling issues (Sierra &amp; opposed a combined 27 R's in the climate solutions caucus in 2018). 1/2
@supersayianluke Yup!  When Germany closed down its own nuclear fleet out of unfounded fear of a Fukushima happening there, they replaced the lost energy production by buying energy...from France's nuclear fleet!!!  #Ironic
@RebeccaEWebber However, the partisan problem is funding. On climate policy alone, foundations granted $700 million over past 5 yrs...less than 1% went to right of center orgs. Hence, the public is pounded by left of center messaging that R's are horrible on the topic.

@MikeBloomberg Here's a Republican proposal on climate. The Reverse Carbon Tax.  https://t.co/2QNry8lY3r
@NEI Here's the answer. The Reverse Carbon Tax. Eliminates taxes on zero emission energy, lowers utility bills, eliminates need for surcharges on bills to subsidize nuclear, keeps nuclear on line, spurs innovation. https://t.co/2QNry8lY3r
On Valentine's Day 1884, Theodore Roosevelt's mother and wife died within an hour of each other. His wife, just after giving birth to their daughter, Alice. The heartache sent TR into the wilds of North Dakota, where soul searching forged the man we remember on Mt. Rushmore.

@StephenSage8 @newtgingrich Americans support strong enviro policy when the milk/honey is flowing.

We never endorse against good pro-conservation electeds, R or D. Why? Because history says the best, long lasting policies have strong bipartisan support. Do major green groups really put climate policy first, or non-green agenda? If so, that's ok. Just disclose it.
Homework for new followers. Look up Climate Solutions Caucus. 45 Republican members before the election. Today, just 20. 2 major green groups worked to defeat 27 of the R's.  1/2
@DLucksDS @bellport_phys @KHayhoe The majority of Republicans do care. It’s a small minority who vote in primaries that are the tail that wag the dog. We need funding and infrastructure to consolidate right of center pro environmental voters to change dynamic.
@DLucksDS @bellport_phys @KHayhoe Our president would be very happy to get on the phone with you discuss. We believe it is a structural problem with primary elections.  If we could follow Rep. Ehlers and Sen. Graham's advice, we'd have infrastructure in place to offset that problem.
@imdoctorpaul @KHayhoe I think we've both made our points, and clogged Katharine's twitter feed. Let's plan to meet in Ontario sometime soon for a Puppers or Labatt's and discuss in earnest!
@imdoctorpaul @KHayhoe And to answer your posit. There is a reason why progressive funders don't fund this work. They don't want Republicans to look good on the environment or climate.
@imdoctorpaul @KHayhoe So, the answer is to consolidate Republican/conservative voters into an authentic right of center group to "have the backs" of Republicans so they no longer fear primaries.  Remember, Al Gore's Climate Reality group, alone has almost 400,000 of us in its database!
@imdoctorpaul @KHayhoe Lindsey Graham pulled out of the Kerry-Lieberman-Graham climate bill and said, "Environmental groups are really good about getting their members to call, write, and email us. The problem is those people don't for us."
@imdoctorpaul @KHayhoe Ehlers said, "If I'd just heard from 100 Republican voters from my district that they wanted me to vote "yes", I would have."
@imdoctorpaul @KHayhoe The late Rep. Vern Ehlers (a physicist) voted "No" on Waxman Markey. He told our president later that Rush Limbaugh told his audience Ehlers was on the fence on the bill had generated so many "Vote NO" calls into Ehlers office on the issue, it froze his phone system.
@imdoctorpaul @KHayhoe Even in today's Congress, we're only aware of 4 R members of Congress who don't really understand climate science.  So many others would like to act, but &lt;primaries&gt;.  Stay with us on this....
@imdoctorpaul @KHayhoe There is none...unless it is that progressive funders intended to weaponize the environment for DNC electoral purposes. Why did Sierra Club and LCV oppose 27 of the R's in the Climate Solutions Caucus last November?
@KHayhoe @imdoctorpaul It's okay Katharine. We've heard worse! Part of the problem is foundations spent $700 million over past 5 years on climate advocacy. Less than 1% went to right of center groups. Our voice has been drowned out due to that. It's easy to understand why people think we're unicorns!
@ChristineHeenan @RockefellerFdn Climate change is solvable...if only right of center groups received more than a fraction of 1% of the $700 million doled out by foundations over the past five years on the topic.  Give us a big enough lever and place to stand, and we'll move the earth!
@PhillyTurtleGuy @jjbigbend @KHayhoe Here is a piece by our friend @elilehrerdc.  No one is going to claim Reagan in the same breath as TR, Nixon, or GHWBush, or John Lacey or John Saylor, but he did have his moments. https://t.co/3adUM61DNB
@PhillyTurtleGuy @jjbigbend @KHayhoe You get no argument on that from us.
@z00ropa Fourth and most importantly, is our electoral system. The current primary system forces candidates to play to the farthest extremes. We've been around for 24 years--the anti-enviro stance of the party is not mainstream.
@z00ropa Third, there is a difference in policy prescriptions for problems. Some resonate with the left, some with the right.
@z00ropa Second, many Republican or conservative voters make Pro Life their singular litmus test. It's why we talk often about climate, clean air, and clean water being pro-life values (or should be!). They'll never vote for a pro choice candidate. 20% of Trump voters voted that solely.
@z00ropa Good question, a thoughtful answer will take too long, but we'll try to hit highpoints in this thread:  First, every environmental act we take for granted today was passed with strong bipartisan majorities.  We need bipartisan support to insure policies last.
@jjbigbend @PhillyTurtleGuy @KHayhoe Staff members were able to open the link on their devices. But, here is the salient info: https://t.co/fjJddo7GjE
@jjbigbend @PhillyTurtleGuy @KHayhoe Hmm.  We just googled it and the article popped up, and we don't pay for it. Sorry...maybe do the same thing?
@DLucksDS @bellport_phys @KHayhoe Depends on your definition of what or who is a conservative.  As Russell Kirk said, "Nothing is more conservative than conservation".  A true conservative gives future generations equal voice in matters, and does not make decisions based on the next quarter end or election.

@bellport_phys @DLucksDS @KHayhoe Re; Reagan and the Montreal Protocol https://t.co/Y77lN6k6Bp
@martinlentink Naw, Al Gore's Climate Reality Project has nearly 400,000 Republicans/conservatives in its database.  Micro targeting research suggests there are 20,000 pro climate action, high efficacy Republicans in most Congressional districts.
Hi Brad- The Montreal Protocol has prevented the release of more GHG than other act by our government.  It also paved the way to heal the hole in the ozone layer. Reagan told his political advisors to take a hike, and backed his science advisors on it. https://t.co/Hy0egkffAe
Hi, I'm a Republican conservationist. You may know me from my greatist hits including "We Need a Man Like Teddy Again",  "Lincoln Does Yosemite", "Reagan and the Montreal Protocol", "Read My Lips-No Net Loss of Wetlands", and "Yes, Virginia, there are green Republicans". https://t.co/2ne5Ppxh6B

Curious...does anyone disagree with our motto, "Conservation IS Conservative?"
@aronro We field the following question every day: "What can I do to reduce my energy or water usage?".  This is perfect to add to our arsenal of information. Thank you!
@aronro @shakaplan @AstroKatie @TheCLCouncil @republicEn We were told once, point blank, by a foundation executive, "Why on earth would we want to support a viable network of Republicans or conservatives?"
@aronro @shakaplan @AstroKatie @TheCLCouncil @republicEn The BIGGEST problem is funding.  Major foundations granted $700 million over last five years for climate programming. Less than 1% went to center-right groups.  That means almost every nickel went to preach to the choir. Give us a long enough lever and we'll move the world!
@shakaplan @aronro @AstroKatie @TheCLCouncil @republicEn @KHayhoe One approach we take with conservatives is to stress that climate protection (and clean air, clean water) are fundamentally Pro Life issues.  Unfortunately, we've never been able to get major left of center green groups to pursue this.
@aronro @shakaplan @AstroKatie @TheCLCouncil @republicEn @KHayhoe Our boss spoke at a Theology on Tap in Bozeman, MT and talked about @KHayhoe to no end! ConservAmerica would love to bottle her knowledge, skills, and communication techniques to distribute nationwide.
@shakaplan @KHayhoe @aronro @AstroKatie @TheCLCouncil @republicEn That's not crass. You're spot on. There are billions to be made. The question is, will the US or China lead on those technologies?

The bipartisan @citizensclimate has done a heckuva job building the Climate Solutions Caucus up to 90 members. So why are some green groups trying to defeat up to 20 of its members?
@MsNathJones @SenateGOP Big action&gt;Support all 90 members of the Climate Solutions Caucus (45 D + 45 R). Some major green groups are actively trying to defeat R's in the caucus. What message does that send to R's weighing joining the cause?

One of the great 'missed opportunities' in the strategies or platforms of the big green groups is their failure to frame environmental protection (Creation Care) as a Pro-Life issue.
St. Thomas Aquinas: “Any error about creation also leads to an error about God.”
Numbers 35:33-34  	 “You shall not pollute the land in which you live. You shall not defile the land in which you live, in which I also dwell; for I the Lord dwell among the Israelites.”
Ecclesiastes 3:19 	 “Man’s fate is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits them both.”
Genesis 2:15 	 “The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.”
Deuteronomy 10:14 	 “To the Lord your God belongs the heavens, even the highest heavens, the earth and everything in it.”
Genesis 1:31	“God saw all he had made, and it was very good.”

@EPAAWheeler @RepWalberg @MichiganDNR @MichiganDEQ @DucksUnlimited Thanks for highlighting our Great Lakes! They provide drinking water for more than 40 million people, and drive the economy in the Upper Midwest. Much attention needed on waste water infrastructure in region, too.  We're ready to help!
ConservAmerica, founded in 1995, has tried to build that infrastructure. We're still looking for philanthropists who don't want to repeat the mistakes of the past.
“They don’t have much infrastructure on the Republican side,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). “So when you hear the environmental community is mad at you, everyone says, ‘Tell me something new.’ It’s not like a support group you’ve lost.”

@funnygirlescope Let's just agree to disagree, okay? We want clean air, clean water, and a healthy climate, probably just like you. We just have different strategies on how to do it. Best wishes to you!
@funnygirlescope Again, most of those votes or positions are not germane to enviornment, conservation.
@funnygirlescope We think there are a lot of great pro-environment, pro-conservation Democrats in Congress and in races.  We believe, though, lasting enviro policy requires broad bipartisan support...hence why we focus on R's.
@funnygirlescope LCV named NH Rep. Charlie Bass a conservation champion (in a non election year). The next year, it endorsed his Democrat challenger. Take all environmental scorecards with a grain of salt. We need bipartisan champions in Congress!
As our endorsement of Fred Upton indicates, we are so grateful for his leadership on Great Lakes issues, and other conservation issues of concern! Thanks Fred! https://t.co/p16NfFY5JW
@funnygirlescope LCV cherry picks scores. For example, they scored a procedural vote to recommit and claimed IL Rep. Bob Dold supported drilling for oil in Lake Michigan! Total fabrication. LCV endorsed against multiple GOP members of Climate Solutions Caucus. So much for bipartisanship.
@funnygirlescope Our niche is conservation, environmental protection and energy.  We don't take any other issue into consideration.
@funnygirlescope @RepBrianFitz @RodneyDavis @RepDaveJoyce Rep. Davis has also been one of the most vocal leaders in Congress in support of nuclear energy which is our number one source of emission free energy.
@funnygirlescope @RepBrianFitz @RodneyDavis @RepDaveJoyce Rep. Davis has also been integral in insuring conservation titles are kept in or expanded in the farm bill. Here's one example: https://t.co/4tSnricOaK
@funnygirlescope @RepBrianFitz @RodneyDavis @RepDaveJoyce https://t.co/QXJPGVdmsU  The best, most lasting environmental acts in our nation's history have been bipartisan. We applaud Rep.

who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. "
who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause;
"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly;

@KathrynECramer @schaff_sara @RepStefanik In 2009, we were credited with getting enough to pass American Clean Energy &amp; Security Act. Former president of The Wilderness Society called us most important group working to protect the Arctic.
@KathrynECramer @schaff_sara @RepStefanik We created the Zero Emissions strategy to reduce emissions via tax cuts. Report language approved by House appropriations committee this year.
@KathrynECramer @schaff_sara @RepStefanik In 2014, we were group that convinced Speaker to pull wilderness bills out of committee and pass into law. Working now on LWCF, Recovering America’s Wildlife Act, and a few others.
@KathrynECramer @schaff_sara @RepStefanik Certainly. Last year, we were credited with getting Blue Collar Solar and School Energy Efficiency pilot programs in AZ. $45 mil of rooftop solar on low income homes, $660k annual savings for schools reinvested in classrooms.
@schaff_sara @RepStefanik We agree with you. The boss weighed in our too enthusiastic defense of people we know are putting their careers on the line. KCCO—Keep Calm and Conserve On is on a post it note on our control panel now. Best wishes!

@schaff_sara @RepStefanik LCV named Charlie Bass one of its champions in an off year, then endorsed his Dem challenger the next year.
@schaff_sara @RepStefanik Our founder quit LCV’s scorecard committee a decade ago because it was always skewed to make R’s look bad. Procedural votes, non germane amendments made on party lines are held against them.
@schaff_sara @RepStefanik Did you know LCV’s &amp; Sierra’s State chapters in WA fought to defeat carbon tax initiative in 2016? Why? They opposed revenue neutral design. For that alone both get a zero on our scorecard.
@schaff_sara @RepStefanik Did you know LCV/Sierra Club didn’t endorse a single Republican member of Climate Solutions Caucus in 2016? There’s a partisan problem on our issues, but it’s a 2 way street.
@schaff_sara @RepStefanik LCV has stabbed Republicans in the back time and again. We call it LCV’s Charlie Bass Rule. Praise in off years, automatically support the D in election years.

@AFeldman2 @PaulWalker_AZ Zero Regrets incents utilities and regulators to accelerate clean energy. Carbon tax will be passed on to consumers—no incentive for utilities to change production.
@AFeldman2 @PaulWalker_AZ Question should be: which plan can be passed in Congress and signed by POTUS? We believe Zero Regrets is the answer.
@AFeldman2 @PaulWalker_AZ The key is our plan has a sponsor in Congress and should in committee 1st QTR 2018. Carbon tax has no path to passage w/o 70 Dem Senators.
@AFeldman2 @PaulWalker_AZ Zero Regrets is the reverse of a carbon tax. It you want more of something, you tax it less. We remove taxes from clean energy, and cut the govt out as middle man. Savings go directly to consumers' wallets, not govt in form of taxes.

Our School Energy Efficiency pilot program saw $2 mil invested in financially at-risk schools. 1st yr savings = $660K.  Enough to hire more than 20 new teachers. Is your state ready to adopt our policy?

Carbon Tax initiative in WA proved many left of center see tax revenue as key goal, not reducing emissions.
Our solution is simple. Remove taxes from zero emission energy. Pass savings to consumers in lower electric bills. Sets price signal.

@WiseHiker @citizensclimate LCV once name Rep. Charlie Bass a hero, then promptly opposed him in the next election only because he was a Republican.
@WiseHiker @citizensclimate We're pointing to Sierra Club and LCV when we talk about the lack of credibility of progressive green groups.
@WiseHiker @citizensclimate We love CCL because of the reasonable and respectful approach to every Hill office it visits. If only the big green groups followed you.
@WiseHiker @citizensclimate We don't include CCL in the definition of "green groups".  CCL only position is a carbon tax and dividend to address carbon emissions.
