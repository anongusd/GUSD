Today we celebrate 50 years of unity, 50 years of freedom, and 50 years of hope – for a city, for a country, for a people and for the world.
Truth is, America and Jerusalem were bound together from the very beginning #50forJerusalem
That was expressed this week when the US Senate voted to reaffirm support for a united Jerusalem and to recognize it as Israel’s capital.
If there is a country outside of Israel that appreciates what Jerusalem means to both Jews and non-Jews alike, it is the USA.
Under Israel’s sovereignty, the Jewish and Arab residents of Jerusalem coexist in an open, diverse, and vibrant city.
Three Hebrew words express the hopes and dreams of an entire people: לשנה הבאה בירושלים - Next Year in Jerusalem.
For over 3,000 years, Jerusalem has been at the center of our national and religious life #50forJerusalem
To understand how unique that moment was, one must appreciate what Jerusalem means to the Jewish people.
– a moment that occurred exactly 50 years ago today.

My speech tonight at the annual Rosh Hashana reception. 		https://t.co/he8DpVh5Na
On the eve of Rosh Hashana, at a time when we are focused on our hopes for the year ahead, let us tonight remember Shimon Peres.
President Peres was that rare leader who was both a dreamer and a doer-talking about the future one day and then making it happen the next.
They are either people of vision who inspire or they are people of action who get things done. 2/2
First, great figures in public life tend to be either dreamers or doers.  1/2
He is also only the 7th non-American to have received both the Congressional Gold Medal and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
tomorrow will be only the sixth time that an American flag will be flown at half-staff following the death of a foreign leader.  2/2
As for President Peres’s standing in America. 1/2
Finance,Foreign and Defense Minister – a distinction no American President can claim. 3/3
And he is the only Prime Minister to have held all three of Israel’s senior cabinet positions  2/3
Shimon Peres is the only Israeli to have been both President and Prime Minister.	1/3
I appreciated him greatly for his life of service to Israel and for the central role he played in the life of Israel.
I last saw President Peres 6 weeks ago. He was as alert and dynamic as I had seen him in years.
So tonight’s event is not just about celebrating the coming New Year.  It’s also about mourning the passing of one of Israel’s giants.
But two days ago, our former President Shimon Peres passed away.
To make clear how important this assistance is for Israel’s security as it will enable Israel defend itself by itself far into the future.
To express Israel’s deep appreciation to the Obama administration for the MOU agreement that was signed earlier this month.
I was hoping to use this annual Rosh Hashana reception to focus on the good news of recent weeks

... in the Jewish people once again having a voice, a refuge, and most importantly, the power to defend ourselves. #HonoringRAN
That is why like many Jews, I find great comfort in the rebirth of a sovereign Jewish state in our ancestral homeland...
For me, the Holocaust was the attempt to wipe out the Jewish people - &amp; its primary lesson is to never be powerless against their enemies.
We still try to learn some lesson that will shine light in the darkness. #HonoringRAN
71 yrs after the liberation of Auschwitz, we still try to make some sense of the Holocaust.
Tonight, the names of your four esteemed relatives join the names of Oscar Schindler, Raoul Wallenberg and other Righteous Among the Nations
The Jewish people are an ancient people with a very long memory.  We forget neither our most wicked enemies nor our most righteous friends.
Mr. Spielberg, thank you for using your prodigious talent to spread awareness of the Holocaust across the world and across generations.

"The people of Israel have withstood every challenge they have faced. And I have no doubt that the spirit of Israel will never be broken."
"Much has changed in the last 67 years.  But one thing has stayed the same: the resolve of the Israeli people." #IACKenes
"The killers are glorified. Candies are passed out in the streets. And the PA spends millions to support the killers’ families."#IACKenes
"A generation of Palestinians has grown up in a society that glorifies the murder of Jews." #IACKenes
"Since Oslo, the Palestinian leadership has tried to poison an entire generation of young Palestinians to hate Israel and to hate Jews."
“Terror attacks occurred when the peace process was racing ahead and when the peace process was at a standstill.” #IACKenes
"But the idea that renewing the peace process or withdrawing from the territories will somehow stop terrorism is fiction." #IACKenes
"Israel wants to reach a political settlement with the Palestinians that will enable both Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace."2\2
“Israel should advance peace with the Palestinians for its own sake–because Israel doesn’t want to become a binational state and because”1\2
"The government of Israel is doing everything possible to stop this latest wave of terrorism, and I am confident that Israel will succeed."
“ability to defend itself by itself against any threat and enable Israel to address the enormous challenges we now face in the region.” 2\2
“Israel hopes that the discussions we’re now engaged in will culminate in a long-term agreement that will dramatically upgrade Israel’s,”1\2
“the deal and those who opposed it - have expressed a strong commitment to bolster Israel’s security.” 2\2
“Israel deeply appreciates that President Obama, as well as Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle - both those who supported” 1\2
“Hoping to forge a common policy with the United States to address the continuing dangers posed by Iran.” 2\2
With the nuclear deal now moving ahead, Israel is also moving ahead,”1\2
“That alliance has weathered many disagreements over the decades.”2/2 # IACKenes
“Part of ensuring Israel’s future is working to strengthen the alliance between Israel and America.” 1\2
“Israel will not only continue to survive. It will continue to thrive. We will continue to build and strengthen our remarkable country.”
"Israel will never surrender to terrorists. The State of Israel is strong. The people of Israel are even stronger." # IACKenes

.@OccupyWallStNYC Jewish ppl are not foreign colonialists in land of Israel. Jews have been living in land contiunously since biblical times
.@OccupyWallStNYC UN called 4 Jewish state &amp; Arab state. It was a recognition of historical/legal/moral right of Jewish ppl 2 their homeland
.@OccupyWallStNYC There wouldn'tt be a single Palestinian refugee today had the Arab world accepted the UN's 2 state solution in 1947
Last question guys, I have a day job. #AskDermer

In memory of the Warsaw Ghetto fighters, in memory of the six million, we stand strong w/ Israel &amp; vow never again. https://t.co/zbTgH7Yir1
Pres. Obama @YadVashem, similarly declared, "with the survival of a strong Jewish State of Israel, such a Holocaust can never happen again."
As PM Netanyahu pledged: "There will never again be another Holocaust" bc today Israel exists with the right &amp; the ability to defend itself.
We remember those valiant women and men, and remember the six million lost to the Jewish people--and humanity--forever.
It's a reminder of our need to remain vigilant to the dark forces that still seek to destroy us. #YomHaShoah
Their battle remains for us a reminder of the many paths of Jewish resistance to the Holocaust
70 yrs ago, Jewish fighters in the Warsaw Ghetto struggled agnst an insurmountable Nazi scourge to alert the world to the genocide in Europe
On Yom HaShoah, in the memory of the six million, we stand strong with Israel &amp; vow "never again." https://t.co/zbTgH7Yir1
Today, we mark Yom Hashoah, Holocaust Remembrance Day &amp; remember the 6,000,000 Jews who perished in the Holocaust.

Read my full note on President Obama's visit and Passover: https://t.co/i0pW7Lt6qS
As we gather with our families for Passover, we must reassert our commitment to peace, as well as our determination to defend ourselves.
By laying a wreath on the grave of Herzl, Obama bestowed a Presidential imprimatur on the Zionist idea and legitimacy of Jewish statehood.
His tour, together w/PM Netanyahu, of the Dead Sea scrolls, upheld the millennial-long connection bw the Jewish people &amp; the land of Israel.
The Seder table is arrayed w/symbols of suffering, redemption &amp; renewal. Similarly, President Obama's visit to Israel was ripe w/symbolism.
Wishing everyone a Happy Passover, Chag Sameach. https://t.co/i0pW7Lt6qS

I want to convey my full support for the citizens of southern #Israel and for the soldiers who are carrying their just and valid mission.
IDF embarked in Operation #PillarofDefense to destroy the terrorists’ long-range rockets &amp; to restore security to residents of the south.
Facing such aggression, #Israel has demonstrated extraordinary restraint, but no country can sustain such flagrant attacks indefinitely.
The lives of a million #Israelis have been endangered and many of them have huddled in bomb shelters, unable to get to school or to work.
#Gaza terrorists fired over 300 rockets at #Israel last month alone – over 800 in 2012 – in an attempt to kill innocent civilians.
