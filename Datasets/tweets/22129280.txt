Overnight in Hanoi, President Trump: 	- Ended summit early without agmt	- Appeared to walk back demand for full denuclearization 	- Questioned US intel assessment NK still expanding nuclear program 	- Accepted Kim’s denial of involvement in Otto Warmbier death
Latest: President Trump has now departed Vietnam after failing to reach a deal with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.
Truly remarkable: Trump runs cover for Kim on Otto Warmbier: “I don’t believe he would have allowed that...he felt very badly about it...he tells me that he didn’t know about it and I will take him at his word”.
!!: Trump just walked back demand for complete denuclearization by North Korea - “We want a lot to be given up.”
Trump once again denies US intel assessments North Korea continues to manufacture missiles and nuclear materials: “Some people saying that and some people denying that,” he says.
Asked about Cohen testimony that he’s a liar and corrupt, Trump answers only with “no collusion” and “hoax” lines.
Trump calls Cohen testimony a “fake hearing” and adds “having it during this important summit was incredible”.
Trump appears visibly muted, not quite selling the “constructive” talks line.

Answering perhaps his first question ever from a western reporter, Kim says of his hopes for summit: “Well it’s still too early to tell. But I wouldn’t say that I’m pessimistic. From what I feel right now, I do have a feeling that good results would come out.”
Trump’s reliance on economic riches misreads North Korea’s key motivation: Kim and his predecessors have never promised their people wealth, only “purity” and resistance to western dominance based on military power. https://t.co/WEilYCtlYG
Seated with Kim, Trump repeats his lack of urgency: “There’s no rush...Speed is not important.” Question is: is he taking it slow on full denuclearization or on any substantive concessions at all?

@john_sipher And yet, they are repeated by the WH and believed by many of his supporters. Oddly, it's unlikely hearing the opposite from the nation's intel chiefs - whom he appointed - will change that view.
!!: Asked about what was discussed between Trump and Putin in their private meetings, DNI Coats said the topic was “clearly a sensitive issue”, best discussed in a closed setting later this afternoon.
One issue that does not come up as a leading Worldwide Threat? The nation’s southern border. How will the president then credibly claim a national emergency there?
The nation's senior-most intel officials are making clear many of Trump's claims are not based on intelligence:	- ISIS is not defeated	- North Korea is not denuclearizing	- Russia still interfering in US elections	- Climate change is real &amp; endangers US national security
Who was DNI Coats responding to here?: “I have told our workforce over and over that our mission is to seek the truth and speak the truth...Despite the swirl of politics that swirls around not only the capitol but the world, our mission is to keep our heads down.”

Just in: DNI’s threat assessment directly contradicts Trump on North Korea: “the IC continues to assess that it is unlikely to give up all of its WMD stockpiles, delivery systems, and production capabilities. North Korean leaders view nuclear arms as critical to regime survival”

Asked if the president directed a “senior Trump campaign official” to contact Roger Stone about future Wikileaks releases, @PressSec does not answer.
For two years, two consistent themes have characterized the Russia investigation:		- Trump campaign officials and advisors were in regular contact with Kremlin-tied Russians and a Russian cutout (Wikileaks)		- Those officials and advisors repeatedly lied about those contacts.
Good. Old-fashioned. Reporting. https://t.co/RTDpfurSve
More to concern Trump: “Organization 1 (Wikileaks) released the first set of emails stolen from the Clinton Campaign chairman. Shortly after Organization 1’s release, an associate of the highranking Trump Campaign official sent a text message to STONE that read 'well done.'"
The FBI agents who arrested Roger Stone before sunrise this morning - like all the bureau’s 35,000 employees - are not getting paid due to the shutdown.
This line should concern Trump: “A senior Trump Campaign official was directed to contact STONE about..what other damaging information Org 1 had regarding the Clinton Campaign. STONE thereafter told the Trump Campaign about potential future releases of damaging material by Org 1”

A remarkable turn within days: from Flynn lawyers claiming entrapment, to Flynn and lawyers admitting he repeatedly &amp; willfully lied, to lawyers clearly concerned he may be facing jail time and asking for delay.
Breaking: Flynn's attorney asks judge to delay sentencing. "We are prepared to take your honor up on his suggestion of delaying sentencing, so he can eke out the last modicum of cooperation" in Virginia, Flynn’s attorney said.
---&gt;&gt;&gt; https://t.co/GNJx4gEPD1
Judge asked if Flynn's conduct "rises to the level of treasonous activity?"		Brandon Van Grack, speaking for special counsel, said prosecutors did not consider charging Flynn w/treason.	 	Sullivan asked again: "Could he have been charged with treason?”	 	Van Grack wouldn't answer
FYI: Judge Emmet Sullivan was nominated by Reagan, Bush and Clinton to his successive judicial posts.
"The points raised by Flynn in his sentencing memorandum concern the court," Sullivan said, asking prosecutors if they believe Flynn accepts responsibility. "Was their some doubt in your mind he was wavering on acceptance?" Counsel approached bench &amp; they spoke under seal.
Two possibilities now: 		- Outlets &amp; officials who accused the FBI of entrapping Flynn will accept his and his lawyer’s statements to the contrary. 	Or	- They will claim Flynn again succumbed to undue pressure from the judge and Special Counsel. 		Discuss.
"Arguably you sold your country out," Judge tells Flynn. "I am not hiding my disgust, my disdain for your criminal offense," he added, his voice straining. 		Takes a brief pause. 		"Yes, your honor," Flynn says. He was not asked a question.
Special Counsel says it "remains a possibility" that Flynn will continue to cooperate. 		Judge adds, “The more you assist the government the more you arguably help yourself at the time of sentencing.”
"A high ranking official of the government" making false statements in the White House is a "very serious offense," Judge Sullivan says. Sullivan also noted that Flynn was still serving on the Trump campaign at the time of the incidents that led to his lie about Turkey lobbying.

Read these, as always, as diversionary. As FBI memos released yesterday show: Flynn willfully lied twice to FBI investigators about consequential conversations with Russian ambassador - and the FBI agents gave him multiple opportunities to correct his story. https://t.co/dMUvWyZjAP
This FBI memo effectively buries the “perjury trap” defense for Michael Flynn. He twice lied about conversations with the Russian ambassador regarding issues he knew were important: urging Russia not to retaliate for US sanctions &amp; urging it to block UN resolution on Israel.
This memo documents willful lies. Case in point: Flynn told agents that, “No,” he had not sought to influence Russia’s vote on a UN vote on Israeli settlements. But charging documents filed last year show FBI knew he had asked Russia to vote against or delay the resolution https://t.co/vkyDJZwqVM

Mutility (myoo•til•eh•tee) (noun): the painful futility of a late-season surge by yet another @Mets team already long-eliminated from the playoffs.
In the long slog of the Special Counsel investigation, this stands out:		Five Trump aides have now pleaded guilty to charges related to the probe. 		- Paul Manafort	- Michael Cohen	- Michael Flynn	- Rick Gates	- George Papadopoulos
This is big:		Cooperation agmt  includes:	-interviews &amp; briefings with the special counsel 	- turning over documents	- testifying in other proceedings 	 	Also, Manafort has waived right to have lawyers representing him present at any interviews. 		CNN’s @kpolantz reports https://t.co/F6SiTgdd8X
Latest: Paul Manafort has agreed to cooperate with the Justice Department and has already proffered information to the government, Prosecutor Andrew Weissmann said in court.
More: Manafort will plead to one count of conspiracy, a count of witness tampering and will forfeit assets. He will also admit to everything the government has charged him with from money laundering conspiracy to illegal foreign lobbying, but won’t be pleading to all the charges. https://t.co/T2CBrV4oid

The #StrzokHearing is America &amp; the Mueller probe in a nut shell: Republicans allege comprehensive bias against Trump while Democrats &amp; - crucially - the FBI argue the FBI is bigger and more honorable that alleged bias of any individual members (for Clinton or Trump)
This hearing is a great lesson for the American people in parliamentary procedure. #StrzokHearing

Looking back, only #1 and #3 in final statement https://t.co/67fxKhZ63H
Just hours before Trump raised US troop withdrawal from Korean Peninsula, SecDef Mattis said “I don’t believe” troop reductions are part of NorthKorea talks, adding that any talk of a reduction  “would be premature.”
Compare language today: “DPRK commits to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” to specificity of 2005 agmt “DPRK committed to abandoning all nuclear weapons &amp; existing nuclear programs &amp; returning, at an early date, to the [NPT] &amp; to IAEA safeguards.”
Also take note: “maximum pressure” is likely over. China is already talking of sanctions relief for #NorthKorea and it is Beijing that has true economic leverage over Pyongyang. That means loss of leverage for US.
Bottom-line: Trump made specific commitments to end military exercises with #SouthKorea &amp; eventually withdraw US forces from peninsula. #NorthKorea made NO specific commitments on timing or verification of denuclearization, also did not give accounting of its nuclear arsenal.
Difficult to sell this as substantive: US official says ‘signing’ will be document from US and NK to acknowledge progress and pledge to keep momentum alive, reports @jeffzeleny #TrumpKimSummit

Trump just massively downgraded the June 12 #NorthKoreaSummit to a "get to know you" meeting.
Bottomline: #NorthKorea committed to nothing and promised nothing, including denuclearization, and yet got a first-ever summit with the US president, something Pyongyang has desired for decades.
"We talked about sanctions" says Trump, indicating what #NorthKorea wants in return.
"I think they want to do that. I know they want to do that." says Trump of #NorthKorea denuclearizing.
"We'll be meeting on June 12 in Singapore" says President Trump. "You people are going to have to travel."

It's easy to dismiss this as just the latest in a series of attacks on law enforcement &amp; the investigation but the danger to the source was a real concern for all agencies involved. Now the source's name is public. https://t.co/RkkQKJGCpt

In fact, multiple sources tell us informant was NOT planted inside campaign. Not clear what the president is basing his claim of “political purposes” here. His own lawyer told CNN this am neither he nor the president has any specific knowledge. https://t.co/M1wiqh1epm
New: “Informant” Trump &amp; Giuliani have been railing about was NOT planted inside the campaign to provide information to investigators, US officials tell me &amp; my colleagues @ShimonPro @LauraAJarrett. Informant is an American but identity closely held at highest levels.
According to an eyewitness account given to a CNN affiliate, a gunman at a high school in Santa Fe, TX entered a classroom and began shooting with what appeared to be a shotgun. The witness says they saw a girl shot in the leg.
New: Santa Fe TX Independent School District has acknowledged an active shooter incident at Santa Fe High School Friday morning

Contradicting Republicans on House Intel Cmte, Senate Intel Cmte endorses IC assessment that #Russia interfered in 2016 election to help Trump and hurt Clinton. "We see no reason to dispute the conclusions", wrote GOP Chmn Burr.
On #NorthKorea's threat to abandon summit, the biggest takeaway is not whether the meeting will still take place but that Kim's positions &amp; brinksmanship have not changed as much as Trump has claimed, or at all. Summit may still happen but what will it net?
New: Russian lobbyist Akhmetshin told Senators Don Trump Jr. "was definitely in charge" of 2016 Trump Tower meeting and started by saying something to the effect of, "So you have some information for us?"
This claim is undermined by WH delay yesterday in responding to North Korean statement &amp; its initial dismissal as a “South Korean media report”. https://t.co/v7t7QIuDKZ
New: Trump Jr talked to Emin Agalarov who arranged Trump Tower meeting then made 11-minute phone call to a blocked number. Trump Jr said he couldn't remember who he called. However, Dems note Corey Lewandowski testified Candidate Trump's primary residence has a blocked number.

This is a judge Trump will not be quoting at rallies: “The Special Counsel would have been remiss to ignore such an obvious potential link between the Trump campaign and the Russian government” - Federal Judge Berman dismissing Manafort’s motion to dismiss.
Language of #North Korea’s state media on US summit is markedly not “honorable”: “The U.S. will have to think twice about the fate of the DPRK-U.S. summit now on high agenda before a provocative military racket against the DPRK in league with the south Korean authorities.” -KCNA
Remember: #NorthKorea is expert at brinksmanship. Is Pyongyang testing Trump? Seeking a concession? Madman theory cuts both ways. https://t.co/c0ThtZpFqA
WH responds to reported NK threat to cancel summit: “We are aware of the South Korean media report. The United States will look at what North Korea has said independently, and continue to coordinate closely with our allies.” – @PressSec

On Trump’s demand he provide relief for #ZTE, Ross says he is exploring “alternate remedies” @PressClubDC
If you dismiss the prospect of a full-blown US-China trade war, Commerce Secretary Ross’s speech today @PressClubDC should concern you. He just made a case for why and how the US would pursue and survive one.
He notes that is “just” .3% of the US economy but for the individual sectors such as, say, pork or soybean farmers, it is a question of survival.
Ross just dismissed a complete loss of US exports to China as a bearable cost for US economy.
