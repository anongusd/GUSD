@StevenTDennis Sounds like he claims he can, or he's in the ballpark: https://t.co/CdFFkZ72iV I buy it. Just watch him fly when he decides he wants to catch-up block a PG full court with a big head start on him.

Getting the impression Nielsen doesn't like Sen. Whitehouse.
@Joseph_Marks_ Schumer ain't on the committee, I don't think. Leahy asked about whether he used that word or anything "substantially similar." She answered "not that word" in reference to shithole but "tough language" on rest.
Not sure why someone won't just explicitly ask Nielsen whether the president used the word "shithouse." She's ducking them all on that so far.

@JakeLaperruque Maybe a little, but it's also kinda neat. It hadn't occurred to me that people would perceive something in MC as inherently "cyber policy"
@JakeLaperruque We do indeed sometimes cover ECPA. Although sometimes we just borrow what MT writes on it.
@JakeLaperruque We're not defining anything as anything. It's an issue that straddles tech and cybersecurity-related issues, so we cover it sometimes.
@JakeLaperruque @MiekeEoyang @Susan_Hennessey Thanks for the thoughtful discussion, all.
