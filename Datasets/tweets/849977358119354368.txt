You will pay more, either through higher taxes or fewer public services (or both). Millionaires and corporations will pay a lot less. The economy and your community will suffer. It will take decades to recover. https://t.co/hqYzzXSc4V #GOPTaxScam #TW
There will be cuts to firefighters, schools, roads and libraries in your town and state. That‚Äôs because the GOP plan eliminates the deduction for local taxes, making it harder to fund these vital services. https://t.co/xbM1WbQEb2 #GOPTaxScam #TW
The plan keeps tax breaks for oil, gas, and coal companies but eliminates or reduces them for solar &amp; wind. The GOP budget slashes funding for EPA. The plan even includes a Polar Payoff allowing drilling in the Arctic refuge. https://t.co/IW1WUmYWoR #GOPTaxScam #TW
