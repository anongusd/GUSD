@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Hummmm been in office less then 25 months but the national debt is all because of Trump? Ed your TDS is blinding you to the truth and maybe seek some help from that wacko Dr that was ranting right before you. Do you have a job as you sure spend lots of time Trolling your Pres!

So do Bernie, AOC, Pocahontas, not understand the wealthy will just move their money to another country. Assets move really easy when your wealthy and look at how much moved into the USA in past year! Guess they want you to forget about that part of their tax plan!More dribble
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump As you breathlessly wait for just anything other then a process crime to back your crazy batshit crazy hate! Your going to be so disappointed in Muellers report like all of you losers,that back socialists take over of our country! Going to roll right over you! Venezuela has room!
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump But we Americans that believe in all of the great things our country has seen under President Trump will, especially after witnessing how far left you idiots have turned! Socialism is a failure and watch us roll in 2020! The wall should be almost finished by then!
@homerkorn55 @200DeepCEO @esaagar So just happened to have a word for word script on hand of what was happening? Really your not that dumb are you? In 1939 the Nazi made film clips of the same type of arrest! Think about what your seeing. Propaganda delivered by the media is just how far in the shit we are! Shame
@esaagar Double standard of legal system is so blatant in our country! Main reason Trump was elected was to show just how corrupt Washington DC is and thank God we all now see it! Where is Bill Barr and his confirmation at? We need a real AG on the job!
@realDonaldTrump I love these keyboard warriors 😂 thank you for showing the people of this country what a big heart you have. Guess we will see just where it gets us real soon! People needed paid but the democrats could care less how much they suffered! Compromise is evident to all now let’s see
Opposition research is only against the law if your a Conservative it looks like! FBI used to make a giant propaganda film somewhat like the Nazi Party started doing in 1939. When does AG Barr get confirmation so he can rein it this mess? Plenty of same laws broken by Clinton DNC https://t.co/fXpYI32l8P

@sai_by_sai @opinonhaver @LisaMarieBoothe @tomselliott You want to act so high and mighty lol it’s politics! But when a freshman congress person openly slams a 20 plus year Senator publicly with false claims she should be reprimanded. BTW is Israel a sovereign nation? If you can’t agree with that fact then nothing else you say matter
@adamcbest @realDonaldTrump Idiot when the government is shutdown? Acting like a spoiled 14 year that won’t admit she is wrong so she has been grounded. Only a true Trump hater would take Nancy’s leaving the country with 800,000 people missing their pay checks as a good thing! Damn hope your proud of that!
@realDonaldTrump Because she is acting like a spoiled 14 year old! Glad you grounded her until she starts acting like Speaker Of the House. These idiots showed all of America they don’t care about 800,000 people furloughed because they can’t admit they are wrong. Someone had to act like a father!

@Mr_MAGA1776 Not asking the right people
@girl4_trump 1of the most racist people in the USA in my opinion!
How about you get Xtra Tuff with your fellow Congress people and demand The funding our President has ask for? The same funding your fellow democrats have voted yes to in the past! Stand with your President and for the security of the American people. If it was Russians you would https://t.co/G9JjBRYwNz
You been in Washington DC with many of these same people for 20+ years. You call them friends! I don’t have friends that act like your friends do or they aren’t my friends for long! Get in their face and tell them exactly what they are doing to our country! Shame on all of you! https://t.co/YqaJ6aswNf
@AOC Your not worth caring about silly bartender! You have to matter for someone to care! But sorry if we still see the ditzy bartender every time you open your mouth you manage to prove it! How often did your draw match at closing time? Bartender ass is the easier ass to hit! Like U

@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Your so funny you act like you been sitting in on meetings with team Mueller 😂😂guess we will someday see and what will you make claim to then?

@NefCanuck @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump We Americans approve of legal immigration, we aren’t weak wrists pussies like you up north that won’t stand up to your flood of immigrants you have coming in! Better check to see just how well that is going in England, Germany, France, before you tell us how it should be done!
@NefCanuck @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump My question is as a Canadian resident your concerned about our politics and a Mueller investigation? Oh so it’s just you don’t like our President, now we see!

@RealSaavedra We have over 2000 miles of Border with Mexico. How is 3000 border patrol employees  of which only 750 are working at 1 time going to control entry? Stupid shit that Nancy&amp;Chuck have falling out of their mouths is simply amazing! Going to cost their party in 2020!
@janetkayb @JimHaley17 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi I bet you lock your doors every time you enter or leave. Shame our own Government puts us at risk over their political power plays! Be safe and armed
@realDonaldTrump Democrats or anyone that acts like we were getting a check is just stupid. Never was the plan but if they want to use that to hold up the funding it’s as fake as they are. Build the wall!
@RealSaavedra Why?  is it because we want to vet the people we allow to become citizens like a smart nation would? America has the most liberal immigration laws in the world for those that come legally! We are a nation of immigrants. Has she looked in the mirror?
Hard to secure your home without windows &amp;  doors, can’t have doors if you don’t have walls. Some things work so great that after 100’s of years they still haven’t been replaced, like the wheel and oh yeah walls. Get back to work Nancy &amp; Chuck we all have seen your true wish 2013

@ChuckCallesto No shit Jim you fool that is proof that WALLS work! Damn you didn’t think that our very well did you?
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Does the law say he can do it ? If it does then he does! You people in Washington DC make these laws so how about you follow them?

@NefCanuck @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump Lol I’m well educated enough I bet I can understand it. But your sure going to be disappointed. Bill Barr might have to give a narrower edict for Mueller to do his witch hunt after all. Now don’t cry there hasn’t been any evidence of a law broken anyway. Collusion by Team Clinton
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch @realDonaldTrump Weak balls (RINOS) are sure to bail out like they have for 40 years. Trump will have to drag them across the line or they will fold.
Trump blew it when handing out the Skittles to Nancy&amp;Chuck should have said only 1-2 would kill them. Would they like to no which 1’s? Kind of like American citizens concerning Illegal Immigrants crossing our border, we want to Vet who is coming! Liars would have pissed themselve
@Redtowel4 @lostmycountry08 Why I stopped renting out my houses .... lots of stupid people in this world!
Trump blew it yesterday! Should have handed Nancy &amp; Chuck a bag of Skittles and told them that 1-2 might kill them! Would they like to know which 1’s? So would we ...when illegals are crossing our border! Only 1-2 is to many if they kill a American citizen! Fund Border Security!
@patfo49 @DICEY63 @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews What are their bargaining points? Nobody see’s any of those for some reason. When ask if he would open government if they would fund wall in 30 days they said no! Walk away liars need to be held accountable
@MPaschke @NickiHunter @realDonaldTrump Hahaha you are still at it, they haven’t taken your phone yet? Why does everything come back to incest? Is that why your in Dr. care?

@NefCanuck @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump Your watching way to much TV with failed attorneys trying to spout laws that fit their agenda. I think our President has real legal team backing him at DOJ that laugh at such nonsense. But hey you keep dreaming of that day and guess we will see won’t we😂 ridiculous dream but SMH
@nikkithecanuck @wolfie_wanderer We never make idle threats. But we are pretty proud to live in Kansas and the freedoms we enjoy here. Just standing up for my President and my state. Hope you understand that is all. We work hard &amp; play hard. Our women are strong beautiful and stand up for their beliefs. Come see
@wolfie_wanderer @nikkithecanuck But we support your President. So funny watching how 2 years later some folks can’t accept the election results. We send steers to slaughter here in Kansas so be careful if you drive through our great state. Maybe strap on, as we all open carry in this state as well🌪no 💩whiner!
@NefCanuck @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump Where are those broken laws at again? Did I miss something? Just because you personally don’t like your President really don’t matter. Can’t convict someone for pissing you off when he tweets! But nice comparison in your mind I guess? I prefer truth and facts not emotional bull !
@MattLeinweaver @BillOReilly 73% Harvard Poll approval good enough for you? 93% Republican approval same poll good enough? Because you don’t want it don’t make it right now does it? When given a chance to fund government Nancy said no to wall in 30 days! Guess what? Blew their chances, jaws hit the floor! 😂
@BillOReilly President Trump can’t be embarrassed by the media! With a 93% approval by Republicans he is free to fight our fight for us! Standing tall and calling the liars out will drill into their brains constantly reminding them there cover is blown! Liars lie MSM are liars as well! #Trump
@WhiteHouse We the American people not living on a coastline or Illinois stand with you Mr President! 73% of your party is behind you on this. 93% approval by Republicans says your doing what we voted you into office to do! Liars like Nancy&amp;Chuck will fold when truth comes out! Stand strong!
@RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump RyanHill he is the elected President of the USA!

@cvpayne Great speech for American people. I didn’t notice Nancy &amp; Chuck worrying about us! Talk about Flip Flopping like fish out of water! We see how they are liars for 30 years of nothing getting done! They lied to Bush 43 the lied to Bush 41! Trump won’t let it happen again! Crisis 🇺🇸
I guess I missed Nancy &amp; Chuck having compassion for Americans footing the bill for 133billion each year? I missed where they talked about the drugs and deaths crossing our border. Some how I missed the explanation of why they voted for more in 2006 &amp; 2013 but liars failed USA 🇺🇸
They have never kept a promise in 30 years why would we trust them now! Lies and half truth’s facts see what happened in ElPaso after the Wall was built there! These people Nancy &amp; Chuck are liars and proven liars! We have seen where the problem is at! Pathological liars https://t.co/FlIK5mcjuD

Let’s see that makes wages over 11% higher in less the 120 days! You better go job hunting it looks like. But thanks for making my day!
@bob2med Oh your referring to the 9 Trillion the prior 8 years I’m assuming? How did that happen again ? Oh all of Congress &amp; Senate was spending money like all they had to do was print more of it.... so that what they done bright boy. Better get a little more information to battle old gy
@vbeltran13 @Wire4younow @RashidaTlaib @freep Oh thank you I’m a old man lol that has watched many good people die because of Heroin crossing that border you don’t want to protect because it makes sense. Damn 72,000 OD deaths in 2018! Vietnam War only 58,220 soldiers died. But please you explain your plan as I missed it😂😂
How about all the Heroin and Fentenyl that crosses that border? 72,000 overdoes deaths in 2018! Who are they protecting again? Sure isn’t citizens of the USA when more OD deaths then all of Vietnam war! 90% crossing our southern border according to all government reports! #Wall https://t.co/gzdFdYT9vo
@bears49770 @Up_Down_Side_ @RashidaTlaib @freep @GOP Blue ripple because of never Trumper retiring lol how did that Senate go again? Oh yeah and what does the house control? Does it all have to go through the Senate &amp; President? Oh shoot that’s not going to happen now is it😂
@hailstate1979 @RashidaTlaib @freep You do realize you have different God’s right?

@TJGlobal16 @RashidaTlaib @freep They keep forgetting about that plus then of course you have the Senate .... oh shit that won’t work will it! It’s all for MSM coverage! The propaganda arm of the Democratic Party! But I love to LOL at them as they show their true colors!
Ask her how she obeys at home when her husband commands her obedience? Ask her how a mixed blood child would be treated in her home land? This is what Dearborn Mi voted for so let’s watch as she destructs in front of all of us! Congratulations on winning your Congressional seat https://t.co/SrzPdFNOSf
@RealMAGASteve @realDonaldTrump Ask her about her rights at home! Ask her if a mixed blood baby goes to a Muslim country how that person will be treated? The hypocrisy is this lady is huge! Dearborn Mi. You ask for it so now live with her! How do you face the voters after that embarrassing display! Shame on her
@RealSaavedra 72,000 overdose deaths in the USA in 2018. 90% of Heroin and Fentenyl crosses the Mexican Border. We only lost 58,220 soldiers in Vietnam War, these democrats don’t want to protect citizens of the USA. They can’t beat Trump in 2020 if they give in. To many great things happening!
@smjamison3 @raidrmarki @realDonaldTrump @Wharton 400,000 new manufacturing jobs , 4 million more working, 4.5 million fewer on food stamps. Highest median family income in history. But sure keep telling yourself that your right. The mirror is a great place to practice and the person you will see believes that shit! Horrible job
@smjamison3 @raidrmarki @realDonaldTrump @Wharton Why’s would that be is it that you feel superior in some way to me? I also owned a company and also would like to stay retired and not go back to work anytime soon. My retirement earnings have done very well since Trump was elected. Did u notice soon as dems won house Boom crash?
@smbanc @GOP @WhiteHouse True republicans in the sense they roll over like whipped puppies at the 1st sign of confrontation? No wonder we have let this country get to the point of losing it forever!

Don’t get it does he? Romney &amp; McCain both are perfect examples of why Obama was a 8 year President! Hey Mittzy just nod your head yes and keep your opinions to your memoirs! We are getting conservative agenda passed with things you never could have accomplished. Losers &amp; Winners https://t.co/KrMB3LNOTf
Old school republicans just like Flake, McCain etc. RINO’S without any class but because they think they are Elites they never understand why both were horrible presidential candidates Romney &amp; McCain is why we got 8 years of Obama! https://t.co/h3xVWs90bR
So the propaganda arm is trying to say our Border Patrol fires tear gas at helpless women &amp; children as they attempted to cross last night. How about some facts https://t.co/kfmnjLgFzW our brave Border Patrol repelled the attempted illegal border crossing by over 100 people! Damn

Mitt can’t stand the results I guess? Oh he hates the delivery system is his problem! That explains how we got to this point in the 1st place. Guess these old Republicans will never learn how some of us want real results not backstabbing wimps like most of them have proven to be! https://t.co/8pAo6KOacc
Face it the old school republicans have no agenda close to what our President has on getting things accomplished. Same old RINO’S as Flake &amp; McCain, just a different whiner about delivery. Just vote with our President You Wimp Mitt! Simple &amp; Easy https://t.co/Vk3msiyXBB

How immoral is it for these people to try crossing a dangerous desert with small kids. Some get very sick along the way in the hopes they will be allowed to cross our border.

@JenCanova @realDonaldTrump But many of us support a wall as a starting point. Stop spouting talking points and have a original thought of your own. Do you lock your doors? Why would you do that? Oh to keep people out you don’t want in? Same effect as the wall. Think for yourself instead of how U hate Trump
@mattymatt1941 @realDonaldTrump Because he was elected! Get over losing like a man instead of some whining wimp. In 6 more years you will see a new President.

So time to show the American people what it says and we will decide how deep the corruption is in Washington DC! Should we take to the streets in yellow vest to demand we see the truth of what you people in Washington DC have allowed our country to become under your watch? Shame! https://t.co/G0zgZ8G1lB
@DeplorableChoir @dbongino Just how a American hero can be destroyed like this is amazing! Shame on Mueller‘s team of people that make a crime even when there isn’t 1.

@IstayTRILLA @JasonKander Yeah it’s amazing how bad things are for working people in the USA 😂 darn it taxes are lower wages are higher and democrats are in complete denial of facts.

@JasonKander So where do you stand on all the questions I have ask you prior sir? Like if Antifa is protesting in KC do you order the police to stand down? Do you support your law enforcement over illegals in our city? Do you support ICE doing their job? Now answer these and we will decide

After all I understand your not used to Presidents keeping their promises. Guess what this 1 is different he keeps his promises. Congressman Yoder will vote with Trump again lol
@dustoff2 @Brucecaspebarry @RepKevinYoder Just looked at the polls again and maybe you should check them out yourself instead of just using your opinion like everyone should accept it because it’s yours
@Brucecaspebarry @dustoff2 @RepKevinYoder No code build the wall like as the polls show the majority of Americans want. What is so hard for you to understand about that? Yes there will be places where a wal isn’t feasible but those are in very remote areas of the border. Get over it your a minority about the wall!

@CoryBooker @Alyssa_Milano Drama Queen when your been exposed as a fool and you still show your face. How about that huge 750 person turnout to see President Obama tell us more lies like you do every time you open your mouth. Do you think he will be campaigning for long? His ego won’t allow that!

@RepKevinYoder You are my congressman and we need you backing our elected President sir. We went the wall even if your donors don’t so make a choice. Funding for border security is very important to the people of Kansas
@SenWhitehouse The facts say your a liar sir! How about when we get 2 more constitutionalist judges in the next 6 years? BTW how about that California turn out for Obama on the campaign trail how laughable is that. He won’t last long his ego can’t take it lol
@KamalaHarris 36% black voter support for our President is going to ruin your chances. Walk away is growing everyday and your in a panic looking for support. How about that great turn out for Obama in your state? Wow 750 people geez I’m sure that hurt didn’t it! Going to swing that vote lol

@JasonKander Why do 72% of Americans feel it’s disrespectful and you don’t? Why do 81% of Americans want border wall and your party don’t? Why do 69% of Americans want to end sanctuary city’s but your party does not? How about a whopping 83% want immigration reform and your party resist?

@FoxNews Imagine that

@realDonaldTrump Manufactured crisis by the media. News Week,  July 2014 read where under Obama USA had over 24,000 kids in detention centers. Now the media want to make this a President Trump policy when it’s just the law! Congress needs to sit down together and solve this problem TODAY
@MSNBC The democrats have lost all objectives in the face of Trump pressure and are about to realize they are going to lose huge number of seats come November. America see’s exactly what is going on. What a shame that the party of my father has stooped to obstructing the American voter

@marcorubio But the liberal left would prefer North Korea to bomb and kill us to prove they are right! How do you even think about comparing the 2 nations other then they have horrible human rights records and kill their own people! North Korea can kill millions Cubans need car parts 4hoopty
@Beanwoellner @esaagar @hogangidley45 @JoeNBC Then maybe you should call your Congress person and tell them to vote to pass legislation to end it. Nope you would prefer to make out like its President Trumps fault like morning Joe. How could anyone be so horrible to compare USA to Nazi death camps. If you support this then BS
@FoxNews @SenWarren Then get ready to vote on a bill the President will sign and stop your whining about illegals breaking the laws that you have put into place. What is it about the laws and how we make them , that you don’t understand? Isn’t that your job?
@tbroxterman2013 @realDonaldTrump Waaaaa call your democratic Senator tell them it only takes 60 votes to fix it
@GrayManGary @realDonaldTrump Trump won’t sign 1 of the bills because it just continues the hypocrisy of chain migration. Call your democratic Senator and tell him we need 60 votes to end this problem.
@kennedy_donahue @realDonaldTrump Hahahaha not going to happen and you can get mad and cry and scream. Still won’t help. Maybe you should call your Democratic Senator and tell him it only takes 60 votes to fix this problem.
@waltshaub @realDonaldTrump Really sorry you disagree with the laws as written. Perhaps you should take it up with your democratic Senator. Easy to fix
@misterbumface @realDonaldTrump Takes 60 votes and the 4 pillars that have been laid out very clearly. Sorry you don’t like it but most of America sure does!

@ChrisV1639 @realDonaldTrump Wow where u going after this works out for the world? Starting point and end result are all that matter. Let’s see we have 3 prisoners released, testing area destroyed, no money or Concessions made. Should we have sent plane loads of cash and released 5 terrorist? But U hate DJT
@realDonaldTrump Mr President thank u, the haters spinning there BS r amazing. Darn it you should have shouldered up Un and body slammed him according to them. The end result will be what makes them P there pants. Starting point and end results and just stay 2-3 steps ahead of them sir. #MAGA
@IngrahamAngle @MSNBC @realDonaldTrump Laura reading these comments is almost as funny as watching MSNBC, can we just say they have zero idea how foreign negotiations take more then a few hours. The starting point and what we get accomplished in the end are what matter. Dictator with nuclear weapons sure not good 4usa
@jefftiedrich @flergmerg @cangia48 @IngrahamAngle @MSNBC @realDonaldTrump Can’t stand true facts like a liberal snowflake ❄️ block don’t debate someone with answers you don’t like. Your amazing
@cangia48 @IngrahamAngle @MSNBC @realDonaldTrump So I guess we should just blow them off the face of the earth? How many times it takes to be successful? The good time is only the last time. But you go right ahead hoping for world destruction because you hate your president. Sure amazing thought process rattling around in there
@Brian_Chovanec @Resputinkw1 @IngrahamAngle @MSNBC @realDonaldTrump Wow really? You roll with that and sleep good at night when all nuclear weapons are removed from that same dictator. You don’t make any sense at all! It is a start and was never going to end at the beginning.
@JasonKander What is it about cleaning voter registration that is not good for Americans? I have moved counties 3 times in 5 years and have 2 homes. People do die, move, some of us are sick of this democratic policy that only leads to the possibility of voter fraud. But you support it ....wow
@realDonaldTrump @g7 You have to stand strong against the forces that have been taking advantage of our trade for 50 years mr President
@BuckSexton The press forgets all about what Obama done for some strange reason. Bedfellows make stranger deals don’t they!
@FoxNews @POTUS Democrats are in melt down mode and man it sure is funny. Guess the president can pardon himself from any charges for leaking the jobs report an hour early lol losers keep losing!
@tracy_2000 Way to go Peyton
@LouDobbs @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @BloombergQuint About to get schooled and find out Germany is a second fiddle economy wise. Germany don’t want to lose that high earning Iran market!

@dougd48 Those lesson will always be part of your family buddy. Your dad was a rock &amp; his heritage will live on through your kids. He is watching always &amp; very proud of you and all his grandkids.
@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump @SenWarren @SenCoryGardner Pick your fights Laura, we love you, but most of us support legalization of Pot. Why should we be paying for prisoners over pot charges with out tax money? Tax it and pay for all the many things like schools &amp; infrastructure. It makes sense to 75% of Americans. Get on board
@PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump Amazing that he wasn’t even the republicans nominee at that time. Do you think maybe it was after Hillary was facing prison for her server that they started covering all angles? Hummm now that makes some sense don’t it!
@crittersndirt @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Should we blame Obama for all of the lies and deception that he passed off on the American people about Iran? Let the president keep doing the great job he is and climb back under your rock

@realDonaldTrump We will find out what has gone on with the FBI &amp; DOJ getting involved up to there necks in deception. Just keep on doing what we voted for you to do mr President. The rest will come out and maybe at some point arrest and charges will be made against these people.
@realDonaldTrump Ask Jeff Sessions what the hell the hold up is. Americans are sick to death of not getting any answers because the FBI &amp; DOJ have a slow roll that never ends.
@JudicialWatch Where are the charges against this FBI liar, is that a felony or not? DOJ better get moving! Jeff Sessions do your damn job!
@SenateMajLdr @DonaldJTrumpJr Now line up your own party and get some work done. Senate is holding our nation back and Americans have had way to much of all of you stinkers. Back our president now.
@IngrahamAngle @Eagles Jim Acosta the mouth piece of the left is confused how this political ploy backfired on these smart football players. Not going to have headlines that Philadelphia Eagle boycott White House &amp; President Trump ya big dummy Jim. We don’t care about athletes going to the White House!
@sendavidperdue @SenMikeLee Democrats have pooped the bed on this, and now every one knows it’s all because of them. Sure can’t wait until November when we show them the door.
@SaraCarterDC Of course it’s in the land of the DOJ where everything suddenly gets slow rolled and chopped up. Jeff Sessions is worthless and needs to step down so Americans can get some facts.
@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump Wait you mean the Koch brothers are NOT just another republican donor the way the left always calls them out? My liberal friends here in Kansas would tell you differently.  Koch brothers are all about themselves and nobody else. Proud Kansas Republican and nobody’s fool!

So Missouri Governor resigns amid allegations. When you just end up broke because you can’t afford to fight on in court anymore, then the system is broken so bad it might not ever get fixed. Such a sad day for Conservatives they now see how to win. Bankrupt u so you can’t go on!
@JudicialWatch Why has this taken so long to happen? Really after all this time I guess I would be surprised if there was anything left to be found!
@JudicialWatch @TomFitton Just another reason that Muellers witch hunt should be ended. The list now grows beyond any reasonable hint of a transgression by president Trump.
@ABC When the liberal left bankrupts our future with allegations that end up censoring our rights, due to legal fees then the world needs to change how we do things. What a shame you let them win Governor I am truly saddened by what this means.

@AlexPuskas4 @SmallFarmDairy @realDonaldTrump Liberal way and this person isn’t a farmer any more then he is open to dialog unfortunately. I email and stay up with my state senaTors &amp; congress people in my state and district. Perhaps small dairy farmer should try his out.
@SmallFarmDairy @AlexPuskas4 @realDonaldTrump Well that has been going on for 40 years so nothing new about that amigo. Farming is a business and big business for INC. But it’s much harder to make a living with small farms as it always has been. That is why many as work at regular jobs when they have small farms. It’s a life
@SmallFarmDairy @AlexPuskas4 @realDonaldTrump You sure hate our President for some reason &amp; everyone is entitled to voice their opinions. But damn we got it better then ever with great weather and rains hit perfect this year. Maybe you should stop farming if you can’t handle worry
@SmallFarmDairy @AlexPuskas4 @realDonaldTrump Where were you getting your insurance from? We only have 2 carriers in Kansas and hell Iowa is down to 1 before Trump ever got elected. Come on man you are not really going to play that game are u?
@SmallFarmDairy @AlexPuskas4 @realDonaldTrump Really sorry you are finding it so hard to get loans when we just walked in and took out seed money, out of the bank when we planted this year.

@JasonKander How about you acknowledging they blew it and have been blowing it way to often. How did the weaponizing and politicizing the FBI &amp; DOJ work out for the people they are employed to protect? Democrats have a lot to answer for starting with Obama &amp; Comey. Americans aren’t blind.
