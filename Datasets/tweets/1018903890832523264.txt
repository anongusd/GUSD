@bbrandt_1960 @RJGatorEsq But those are all things are all trends that have merely continued on a similar trajectory they were on under Obama.  Most have actually leveled off.  Only under Obama you guys complained about them.  Its always double standards with you guys.  Example: the deficit.
@RJGatorEsq You realize most liberals spend a lot of time laughing at the hypocrisy of the right.  Like how outraged you guys were everytime Obama played golf and then how you fawn over Trump, who's spent half a year playing golf only a year and a half into his presidency.  We laugh at you.

@Chad51905870 @Virgini79734220 @nightlypolitics Trump admitted to colluding with the russians.  He admitted they got dirt at the trump tower meeting and hed previously admitted they discussed the magintsky act at that meeting.  I'm sorry dude, Trump doesnt care about anyone but himself.
@Chad51905870 @Virgini79734220 @nightlypolitics So are you don't think the sitting president colluding with a foreign adversary is a big deal?  That we are grasping at straws because the president sold out national security interests for political gain?  Thats what you are saying

@Danielm599 @FoxNews Russia is attacking our democracy and you want to make friends with them.  They are actively trying steal data from members of,our government to elect people they can control. If you are ok with this you and want to ally yourself with then you are a traitor
@slap_1_d @IngrahamAngle That doesnt make the tweet any less hypocritical since it says not to throw out any you semiliterate waste of carbon
@thehill @Titia12271485 Oh she's on twitter than?
@mikephelps01 @Sammalone3000 @GrrrGraphics @RealAlexJones They were a super power. Now they are an economy smaller than Texas. We dont need them.  We have nothing to negotiate.  They need to be sanctioned into the dirt like north Korea.
@mikephelps01 @Sammalone3000 @GrrrGraphics @RealAlexJones I mean, I gave you the most recent example.  There was also the whole Trump refusing to implement sanctions on Russia and the whole him siding with russia over oir intelligence agencies thing.
@mikephelps01 @Sammalone3000 @GrrrGraphics @RealAlexJones You get your news from a community college dropout who sells herbal supplements to make a living and claims every tragedy that occurs is a false flag.  I listen to actual journalists.  Dude, you might want to reevaluate your shit
@mikephelps01 @Sammalone3000 @GrrrGraphics @RealAlexJones Holy shit dude, your asking me to recap 2 years of news stories in a tweet.  You need to start paying attention to reality and stop gerting your news from a dick pill salesman.  Watch the Helsinki presser
@kb_maga @IngrahamAngle Read the quote again
@Sammalone3000 @mikephelps01 @GrrrGraphics @RealAlexJones Hey, at least swimmer has stopped ending every sentence with the word "derp."  Its funny that he thinks that makes other people look stupid
@mikephelps01 @Sammalone3000 @GrrrGraphics @RealAlexJones I mean, we are the ones arguing that no one should be above the law.  Seriously, how do you make that argument while calling for the end of a very productive investigation?
@mikephelps01 @Sammalone3000 @GrrrGraphics @RealAlexJones Umm, the difference is that Trump is very clearly working for the russians while Clinton just got a blowjob.  One was a partisan witchhunt that wasted millions and led to no indictments and this has already caught multiple foreign assests

@aravosis Oh you have to give someone pie if they ask.  It's not like a wedding cake
@RJGatorEsq @deplorable1971 @Badgerbear87 @FoxNews Additionally, since he also publicly speculated that he might pay for the legal defense of one of the attackers after the attack it is very hard to dismiss his calls to violence as jokes
@RJGatorEsq @deplorable1971 @Badgerbear87 @FoxNews You are selectively listening to what Trump says then.  Since a number of protesters were assaulted at trump rallies clearly some took him seriously.  Public figures, especially leaders, need to be careful with their words for this reason.
If Giuliani is working pro bono he's still overcharging
@mikephelps01 @GrrrGraphics @RealAlexJones Dude 30 indictments in a year and a half is kind of a fuckton of there being there.  Hillary's 0 indictments in 6 years of collective investigation is no there there.  Yet you clowns still chant lock her up.  Pathetic
@deplorable1971 @Badgerbear87 @RJGatorEsq @FoxNews He did on numerous occasions.  Google Trump knock the shit out of em.  He even offered to pay legal fees.  It is also kind of alarming that these things occurred less than 2 years ago and you cant remember them.  If it's not willful ignorance you should see a neurologist.  Nojoke
@RJGatorEsq I mean, you guys are the ones who hold signs calling him daddy, but whatever gets you off at night
@Badgerbear87 @deplorable1971 @RJGatorEsq @FoxNews I've heard Trump use profanity on stage at multiple rallies as well as call for protesters to be attacked.
@ElGringoSpeaks @FoxNews Nah he'll let his foreign service take care of it and then demand lavish public praise because public servants performed highly publicized routine duties while he played golf
@cullycat1 @FoxNews That would have beed douglas Corrigan who was nicknamed wrong way after "accidentally" made a transcontinental flight shortly after Lindbergh.   He had previously applied for a permit but was rejected
@mikephelps01 @GrrrGraphics @RealAlexJones Yeah, those internet broadcasts cost a fortune.  He's totally not pulling a clever version of the Nigerian prince scam on you by talking about ridiculous things to make sure only gullible idiots remain in his audience.  He totally isn't conning you.
@WalshFreedom Joe, you left out facts.  We have too many people ignoring things in plain sight because they can't adjust their world view to fit the world
@Jim_Jordan Probably because you don't give evidence from an investigation to the people being investigated.
@mikephelps01 @GrrrGraphics @RealAlexJones I mean, you don't see left wing "journalists" selling fake herbal supplements while they're broadcasting news.  Or desperately asserting that they are men, so yes, if must be us that are lacking
@mikephelps01 @GrrrGraphics @RealAlexJones People who buy dick pills from alex jones can laugh at me all they want
@mikephelps01 @GrrrGraphics @RealAlexJones I'm here to laugh at gullible idiots.  People who say things like, modern liberalism is associated with a mental disorder.  People who suffer from massive dunning Kruger because they cant differentiate conman from jounalists

I love twitter.  Its so much better than reddit. I can mock the crazies all I want and they individually have to block me.
@mikephelps01 @GrrrGraphics @RealAlexJones You watch Alex Jones.  Your news comes from a guy who rips off his shirt during broadcasts and then tries to sell you dick pills and anti-mind control coffee.  I hate to be the one to break it to you, but you are well below average intelligence.
@Badgerbear87 @RJGatorEsq @FoxNews Also, have you not listened to Trump speak?  You are going to complain about vulgarity while supporting a man who bragged about the size of his dick during the gop debates?  Its like conservatives are having a hypocrisy contest with themselves
@Badgerbear87 @RJGatorEsq @FoxNews The anti-fascists have one objective: stopping fascists.  If you think they are after you then maybe you should objective look at what you are advocating and how it aligns with fascism.  Not to mention, the neonazis in charlotte ran a woman down and were called good people by djt
@mike_lorrey @emptywheel They deny it while literally marching with torches and swastikas and chanting "blood and soil." Then they accuse liberals of being the real nazis.  Maybe we should start accusing them of wanting to tax the rich to improve our social safety net.
Thanks obama https://t.co/6S5gbroJSv
@mikephelps01 @GrrrGraphics @RealAlexJones Dude, there has already been about 30 indictments in a year and a half.  To put that in perspective, the benghazi and Hillary email investigations led to no indictmentsin 6 years.  These guys sold out to the russians.  You can derp all you want, but it only reflects on you
@mikephelps01 @GrrrGraphics @RealAlexJones The investigations are being led by a Republican.  Flynn plead guilty.  The comic  portrayed catching guilty people making mueller look like a clown.  When that was pinted out to you you can only respond "derp," and then claim bias?  This is a national security issue.  Not party.
@RepSteveStivers Oh awesome, are they easing the id restrictions to buy groceries there?
@mikephelps01 @GrrrGraphics @RealAlexJones I mean, I point out crimes committed by Trump appointees and you responded with derp.  It's not my opinion on the facts that are the problem.  It's your inability to respond with any kind of substance.
@Badgerbear87 @RJGatorEsq @FoxNews Libtard, cuck, feminazi, bleeding heart, snowflake.  Yeah, its the liberals who do the name calling.
@BillOReilly You mean like the evidence from the email donald Jr. Tweeted out ove a year ago?
@AnnCoulter You mean the one where she pretended michelle wolf saying she haf perfect smoky eye shadow was insulting her appearance?
@RJGatorEsq @FoxNews Liberals dont look down on you because they're elitists.  They look down on you because you're a senseless moron
@RJGatorEsq @FoxNews You guys got pissed over Obama not wearing a jacket in the Oval office and wearing a tan suit, but I'm the one being silly because fox news is ignoring the president openly obstructing justice on Twitter.  Ok.
@mikephelps01 @GrrrGraphics @RealAlexJones Thats about the level of retort I've grown to expect from you guys

@freedom_moates I'm actually shocked youd want to remind people of the embarrassing abuse of power that was the benghazi investigation.  Especially when you guys are the ones screaming"witch hunt," while dozens of endictments are being handed down
@freedom_moates Actually I believe it was, "at this point what difference does it make." This was after roughly 4 years of investigation/political theater that led to absolutely no charges.just millions of wasted tax payer dollars.
@samrigel @NancyPelosi @RepDanKildee @BarackObama So youre complaining about what?  That Obama covered for a stupid sting operation signed off on by the Bush admin? That still isnt trying to pass the buck.  Dude, if it wasnt for double standards you guys would have no standards
