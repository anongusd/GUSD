The hypocrisy of this President is astounding – Trump framed his entire immigration agenda on fear-mongering &amp; lies, all the while his properties were employing undocumented workers who suffered mistreatment, low-pay, &amp; no benefits under his employment. 	https://t.co/AauTzOtOTH
“DHS has been turning away asylum seekers, families, and other migrants without paperwork as they attempt to apply for entry at legal ports along the U.S-Mexico border. Migrants are then forced to wait days, weeks, or months homeless in Mexico.”	https://t.co/WI8QP8fmI6
According to the @ACLU, “the ban remains illegal and is still blocked by the courts.”		Migrants have a legal right to seek asylum – it’s unacceptable that this President is trying to close the door on vulnerable women and children fleeing violence.	https://t.co/MIBdolXFit
Our dedicated public servants are still suffering from the last #TrumpShutdown – with no back pay in sight &amp; uncertainty in the coming weeks. Like most Americans, they don’t want a border wall – they want to provide for their families &amp; serve their country. https://t.co/WxI1yfjw43

Despite the adversities, the people of Puerto Rico have shown great tenacity, drive and resiliency and will continue working toward recovery, as many say on the island #PuertoRicoSeLevanta. /9
While the administration’s substandard efforts were a failure, Puerto Rico’s spirit remains unbroken. #PuertoRicoSeLevanta /8
As we mark the one year anniversary, CHC members remain committed to holding the administration accountable to ensure that what happened in #PuertoRico and the #USVI does not happen again, &amp; guarantee that aid vital to their recovery is delivered &amp; distributed immediately. /7
Even more alarming is that the Trump Administration siphoned critical funds away from an important emergency and response agency like FEMA in order to separate and jail helpless children. #PuertoRicoSeLevanta	/6
His actions and statements are offensive and disrespectful to the thousands of mourning families that lost their loved ones and erodes public trust that the government will come to the aid of its citizens after a disaster. #PuertoRicoSeLevanta /5
Despite these untenable circumstances, President Trump &amp; his administration have downplayed the crisis &amp; called their response efforts an “unsung success. Worse yet, President Trump has flagrantly denied that nearly 3,000 Americans lost their lives because of #HurricaneMaria. /4
Each passing day brings more pain, suffering, and loss of life for Americans on the island already devastated by desperate living conditions and inadequate medical services. #PuertoRicoSeLevanta /3
The inexcusable &amp; absurd reality remains that 3.5 million Americans continue to suffer without reliable power, housing, food or water. #PuertoRicoSeLevanta /2
Since #HurricaneMaria struck #PuertoRico &amp; the #USVI Islands one year ago, the administration has continued to neglect its responsibility to help families recover &amp; rebuild, callously turning its back on fellow Americans in dire need of our assistance. #PuertoRicoSeLevanta

Never again can we let so many U.S. citizens suffer while the President &amp; Executive branch remain so publicly disinterested. As the leadership organization for Hispanic Members, we respectfully request you to meet with us to follow up on these important matters. /12 #PuertoRico
The Trump Administration’s inability to acknowledge facts and continued attempts to distort reality about recovery efforts in Puerto Rico, erodes public trust that the government will come to the aid of its citizens after a disaster. /11 #PuertoRico
However, President Donald Trump recently made numerous statements on Twitter denying this death toll, touting his Administration’s response to Maria as an “unsung success,” and blaming Democrats for inflating the death toll to make him look bad. /10
Multiple independent studies have reached the same conclusion as the GWU study, that thousands of Americans lost their lives following the devastation from Maria. /9
In the six months following Maria, the study counted 2,975 deaths attributable to the storm and the chaos that followed.  This is a greater death toll than any modern hurricane anywhere in the United States. /8
In August, independent research conducted at the George Washington University (GWU) on behalf of the Commonwealth’s government revealed that the death toll from Maria was far higher than the official death toll of 64. /7 #PuertoRico
The economy, infrastructure, electrical grid, and civic institutions are still rebuilding a year after the storm. It is clear that more must be done to assist Puerto Rico’s recovery. /6
Medical care and basic services are still inadequate to service the Island’s population. Significant debris remains throughout the Island, and more than half of the work orders to ensure homes are habitable have yet to be completed. /5 #PuertoRico
Many families whose homes were damaged or destroyed have not been made whole, and families who were displaced are being cut off from aid to defray the expense of living in temporary housing. /4 #PuertoRico #HurricaneMaria

We have numerous questions regarding reports that the disbursement of federal funds to Puerto Rico have been extremely slow, and that the agency has decided to reject requests to extend the full federal cost share for much of FEMA’s ongoing work. /3 #HurricaneMaria
Although twelve months have passed, we are extremely alarmed that many Puerto Rican survivors of Maria, both on the Island and in the 50 States, continue to face serious challenges. /2 #IStandWithPuertoRico

As a Hispanic American and Chair of the @HispanicCaucus, I hope you understand why I am unable to do that at your reception. 		-@RepLujanGrisham
Those values are the foundation on which #HHM rests; those values are the basis of each #HHM proclamation issued since LBJ;  those are the values that I will honor this month as I celebrate the contributions, culture, deep roots &amp; legacy of the Hispanic community in the U.S. /13
We are a nation of dignity, humanity, tolerance, and hope, and those shared, essential values transcend our political differences. /12
That rhetoric is not only unbecoming of the President of the United States; it has no place in American political discourse. /11
You have ignored and recently tweeted lies about the devastation and loss of life in Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria,  compared immigration to an infestation,  and attacked a judge because of his Hispanic heritage. /10
Your policies harming the Hispanic community evolved from your rhetoric.  During your presidential campaign and as president, you demonized and dehumanized the Hispanic community and spread fear and untruths. /9
Cherishing our loved-ones and family is not just the beating-heart of the Hispanic community, it’s a hallowed value of America’s identity, and your effort to rip apart those most sacred bonds is unconscionable. /8
No other policy that your administration has pursued was more heinous than tearing children away from their parents as they fled extreme violence from Central American countries. /7
The hypocrisy of attending a reception that is supposed to honor their contributions and heritage after your administration has threatened their safety and uprooted their lives is glaring. /6
#TPS has allowed immigrants from those countries to live safely and productively in the United States while their home countries suffer from instability and some of the highest rates of violence in the world. Many have lived &amp; contributed to the United States for decades. /5
Your administration purposefully ignored these conditions and terminated Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for immigrants from several countries, including El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua. /4
Every Hispanic Heritage Month proclamation specifically included September 15 in order to celebrate the independence of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. /3
Your administration has undermined every bipartisan, bicameral effort we have pursued to help our nation’s Dreamers by making hyper-partisan and radical demands. /2
.@realDonaldTrump,		Thanks, but no thanks.		I decline your invitation to attend your Hispanic Heritage Month White House reception.		Your rhetoric, actions &amp; policies betray the values upon which #HHM was founded. 		Let me explain...		-@RepLujanGrisham https://t.co/PVxWzv1Jq5
.@SpeakerRyan,		It’s time we give #Dreamers a certain and secure future. 		Passing the DREAM Act or USA Act would be the highlight of this Congress. 		Will you join me in giving these young people a bright future.?		Sincerely,		@RepLujanGrisham https://t.co/LdlmDUne64

@realDonaldTrump The only way to ensure that what happened in Puerto Rico does not happen again is to first acknowledge the mistakes and work to address them, but this President cannot even do that. #PuertoRico
@realDonaldTrump The people of the Carolinas and mid-Atlantic, the communities affected by wildfires in New Mexico and California, and the thousands who lost loved ones as a result of the Trump Administration’s poor disaster response and recovery deserve better than this.
@realDonaldTrump The President’s inability to acknowledge these facts and his continued attempts to distort reality erodes the public’s trust that the government will come to the aid of its citizens after a disaster.
@realDonaldTrump Multiple independent investigations have all come to the same unfortunate conclusion: thousands of Americans lost their lives following the devastation wrought by hurricane Maria.

@realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP To #DREAMers you make our communities and country stronger and more vibrant - we will never stop fighting for you. #DACA
@realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP The Congressional Hispanic Caucus and I will continue fighting for Dreamers, an open and public debate, and a vote on bipartisan legislation that permanently protects #DREAMers. #DACA
@realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Congress still has an opportunity to show the nation that it can work together to address this Trump-created crisis in a bipartisan, rapid, targeted, and meaningful way. #DACA
@realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP I urge the President and Republican Leaders to put moral decency, families, Dreamers, and the will of the American people above the anti-immigrant demands of a few. #DACA
@realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP These changes threaten to hurt the economy, rip apart families, and betray our values. Frankly, it is indefensible and immoral that in the 344 days since President Trump ended DACA, Congress has still not passed a bipartisan solution for Dreamers. #DACA
Yet, every time a bipartisan solution to the crisis that @realDonaldTrump created is within reach, the administration &amp; @HouseGOP use Dreamers as political pawns to extract hyper-partisan and radical immigration policy changes.
Their commitment to the prosperity of our nation is why a majority of Americans support protecting #DACA recipients and providing them with a permanent legislative path to citizenship.
Yesterday marked the sixth anniversary of #DACA and we celebrated the Dreamers who serve in our military, educate our children, work as doctors and nurses to keep us healthy, and help our economy innovate and thrive as business owners and entrepreneurs. #DACA

The Administration must be held accountable for failing our fellow citizens. They have a responsibility to do all they can to provide those in #PuertoRico &amp; the #USVI with the same rapid and robust response and recovery efforts that other American disaster zones have received. /7 https://t.co/nDwPOOirDF
President Trump and his administration’s failure to meet one of the most basic responsibilities of the federal government is a glaring example of gross negligence. We must stand with #PuertoRico. /6 https://t.co/3bR6Obdw6Y
Despite their self-reliance and determination, too many American citizens in #PuertoRico continue to live under intolerable conditions - without access to clean water, food and electricity. /5 https://t.co/cJUOQExEeo
In the absence of a sufficient federal response, our fellow American citizens in #PuertoRico have done all they can to bring some normalcy to their communities. /4 https://t.co/wSZqYFRVnX
It is inexcusable that Administration failed to prepare &amp; immediately respond to the needs of citizens in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria &amp; disgraceful that they tried to downplay the impact of one of the deadliest natural disasters in American history for political purposes. /3 https://t.co/ZmersYBHZJ
The new death toll study corroborates reports from our fellow Americans in #PuertoRico &amp; countless other leaders who sounded the alarm about the truly devastating impact of #HurricaneMaria &amp; shows the deadly consequences of Trump's haphazard &amp; inadequate disaster response. /2 https://t.co/kBh5Qv0Y2t

As we mark another #MemorialDay, we must fight for a future worthy of their sacrifice where immigrants are celebrated not disparaged; where immigrant servicemembers are welcomed not deported; and where spouses and children of servicemembers are protected from deportation. https://t.co/3onYbFyJgB
Military service has been an honorable way for immigrants to earn citizenship &amp; give back. The tales of fallen servicemembers who were posthumously granted their citizenship are an undeniable example of their duty &amp; belief in our nation’s ideals. /3 https://t.co/SlOnRSGFED
#MemorialDay is also an opportunity to recognize the contributions of immigrant servicemembers to the fabric of our nation and their deeds, bravery and courage in the field of battle.
