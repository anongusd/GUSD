How/why are we on brink of shutdown? Each year, the Congress votes on 12 separate appropriations bills that fund the federal government for the year. The House has done so (since last Sept). The Senate has not. Both bodies have to do so for government to be funded/remain "open".

In the end, it’s my hope that the Senate measure - and the following Conference report - refines and improves the House bill. Today’s vote was a step in the right direction. 8/8
PRO: It move us from a global corporate tax system to a territorial one, aligning us with the way most other countries tax corporate earnings. Not fixing this, as well as the corporate tax rate, has driven a long list of American companies to move their headquarters overseas. 7/8
CON: All told this is not a Fair Tax or Flat Tax simplification. I think the worst of these areas is with small businesses’ complicated 70-30 split on income. This part of the bill needs much more work. 6/8
PRO: Currently, America’s marginal corporate tax rate is the highest worldwide at 35%, while the industrialized average is 23%. This moves us to 20%, making America more competitive globally. This was one of the major selling points for me. 5/8
CON: There's value to people reviewing their tax return and asking if they got their money’s worth. By taking people off the rolls, as this bill does, we give them more reason to be unlimited in their demands of government since they’re not tangibly paying for benefits. 4/8
PRO: On the individual side, the bill eliminates various exemptions and deductions while attempting to broaden the tax base, which allows the House version to drop from seven tax brackets to four. All this is done under the name of tax simplification. 3/8
CON: I don’t like what it does to the deficit. To be clear, you can’t have a tax cut and revenue neutrality. Cutting spending and taxes are essential to smaller government, and I have consistently voted to do both. Congress oftentimes has voted for one but not the other. 2/8
My vote today was consistent with the fact that I have always voted to reduce taxes when given the choice. The bill is a mixed bag, but in the end, I found it to do more good than bad. Allow me to share a few pros and cons as I see them…. 1/8
