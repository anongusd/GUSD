The first poll was much more of a push poll than this one was. It crapped on both parties and used flowery language about how great independents are, and then asked if he was open to voting to an independent candidate.
Also I dunno why he gets called all the time. Maybe because he's a white educated male? He's definitely gotten called from this same pollster before though, and we assumed it was for Bloomberg. But in hindsight it's been Schultz all along.
The polling firm (I think what i heard them say) was RTD Research?
@cooljeanius 🤷🏼‍♀️Those are the only Dem candidates they asked about
Now they're giving Schultz's bio about how he grew up in the projects and helped grow Starbucks, and then asks favorability after that
@james_roe nope only Harris and Warren
My husband is 100% getting a poll from the Schultz campaign right now. Asking a ton of questions about Schultz, and just asked the ballot question between Trump/Warren/Schultz and Trump/Harris/Schultz.

@HotlineJosh @DemFromCT In order to become president you need to win enough electoral college votes. I see no scenario in which he wins a single state. No one should take this seriously other than a spoiler candidate, but who he spoils it for I'm not sure.
@HotlineJosh An independent candidate cannot win a presidential election. He's not beating Trump in a primary. He's not winning a Democratic primary. Thus, he has absolutely zero shot of being president.
