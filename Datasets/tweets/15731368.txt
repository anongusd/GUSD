Michael Cohen got 2 months for lying to Congress, but will be served concurrently with 36 months on fraud charges
Michael Cohen had acknowledged responsibility for his crimes and also blamed "blind loyalty" to Trump before getting the 36-month sentence
Michael Cohen gets 3 years at sentencing - less than NY prosecutors recommended but still substantial prison time

More Sanders on Acosta &amp; the mic incident: We will...never, never tolerate a reporter placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern
The Trump move against Jim Acosta comes after CNN issued a statement calling his attacks on the press danerous and "un-American"
It's extremely unusual for a WH to pull a fulltime reporter's credentials. Also unusual for a reporter to refuse to give up the mic after asking several questions.
WH escalates against Jim Acosta. Sarah Sanders: As a result of today’s incident, the White House is suspending the hard pass of the reporter involved until further notice

Podcast: Jim Acosta won't relinquish mike, Trump berates him; POTUS olive branch to Pelosi; Prez insists on great midterm results despite losing House https://t.co/WctZrn3eqW
OK, there's no debate. The Jeff Sessions letter says "at your request, I am submitting my resignation"
I guess Sessions "resigning" is a bit of a technicality, since Trump wanted him out and has for a long time
That didn't take long: Jeff Sessions resigns. Obviously the attorney general had enough of their strained relationship and probably had no choice
Jim Acosta debated Trump on the caravan, said it wasn't an invasion, asked if he was demonizing immigrants. But POTUS answered the questions until Acosta kept going
Trump slams Jim Acosta when he refuses to surrender mike after asking several Qs: "CNN should be ashamed...You are a rude, terrible person"
Bipartisan nod? Trump gives Nancy Pelosi (!) a shout-out, saying she works hard: "I give her a great deal of credit for what she’s done and what she’s accomplished"
POTUS says the GOP "defied expectations," despite a fundraising disadvantage, a spate of Republican House retirements and "very hostile media coverage"
Trump rebuking losing House Republicans who wouldn't embrace him and lost, including Barbara Comstock and Mia Love: "Mia Love gave me no love"
I say in the column that it wasn't a blue wave. But the Dems, who controlled nothing, now have one house of Congress https://t.co/FdxL0FBBLZ

Hard to overstate importance of Democrats winning House, as it ends one-party control in Washington. Trump faces a very different next 2 years

Podcast: Pipe bomb attacks fuel a war of words between Trump and the media, esp CNN; Megyn Kelly's NBC job in jeopardy after blackface backlash https://t.co/gyFKgyUztj
NYT says NBC has discussed winding down Megyn Kelly's show after blackface backlash--despite her apology. Hollywood Reporter says it's expected to end. Megyn is at a crossroads
Many thanks. My job is not to be political https://t.co/VD1AIJ0L2A
Pipe bomb story intensifies with packages for Biden, Robert DeNiro intercepted, Trump tweet that media should tone it down, pundits pushing back
Why the pipe bomb attacks aimed at CNN and top Democrats are so disturbing--and why the finger-pointing has already begun https://t.co/wcpMmCwbrn
CNN President Jeff Zucker, after bomb mailing, says: "A total and complete lack of understanding at the WH about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media"
Andrew Cuomo says a device was sent to his office. The earlier knockdown of that report turned out to be wrong. The governor says we have lived with terrorism for a long time

Well said https://t.co/MFa5Gy02No
New report: The Miami office of Debbie Wasserman Schultz, former DNC chair, also evacuated after suspicious mailing
CNN says suspicious package sent to its NY bureau was addressed to former CIA director John Brennan
CNN has since corrected the report that a suspicious package was sent to the White House https://t.co/lwK86PEWKU
Read the column. I make no defense of Trump's caravan falsehoods. I do say the tone of the fear-mongering pieces suggests Trump is only politician to play that card
WH just issued statement condemning explosives sent to Obama, Hillary, vowing full investigation; meanwhile, CNN bureua in NY evacuated over report of suspicious device
When exactly were they running the country? https://t.co/Fik0ncXSLh
Trump admits no evidence of Middle Eastern people in caravan. Press was right to challenge him but should acknowledge that both sides play politics of fear https://t.co/CuNp2fHMYB
Scary stuff: Secret Service says explosive devices sent to Obama, Hillary, after pipe bomb put in George Soros mailbox. Put aside politics, this must be fully investigated
For those who say Khashoggi killing no big deal: Trump now calls it "worst coverup ever" &amp; putting 21 Saudi officials on a visa blacklist; more sanctions possible
The press declares war on Trump over the caravan issue--but the politics of fear is a very old playbook https://t.co/CuNp2fHMYB
But the Menendez ad clearly implies I was defending him on bribery &amp; corruption charges years later that ended in a mistrial. I most certainly was not /3
I did challenge a disputed story that Menendez had sex w/ Dominican prostitutes; a local lawyer claimed he'd been offered $5K to pay women to lie about the senator /2

Joe Manchin says he'll vote for Kavanaugh, now that Collins has spoken and his vote isn't needed. The confirmation battle is over
Collins says she believes Christine Ford suffered a sexual assault but that there was no corroboration - so it can't be held against Kavanaugh
Okay, the dwindling suspense is over. Collins is giving a totally pro-Kavanaugh speech
Susan Collins knocking down opposition to Kavanaugh one point at a time. She's up on all 3 cable news networks
Susan Collins begins by attacking special interest groups, dark money opposing nomination, and the distortion of Kavanaugh's testimony

I'm in no way criticizing Kavanaugh's demeanor while he fights for his reputation and career. He's entitled to be angry. But his emotions are overwhelming his testimony
I'm not questioning that Dr. Ford may have been sexually assaulted, but I have never done this. He chokes up recalling his 10 year old daughter saying they should pray for her
Kavanaugh says this character assassination will dissuade good people from serving the country
Kavanaugh is attacking committee Democrats for trying to blow him up. Followed by last-minute smears, crazy stuff, all nonsense, reported breathlessly &amp; often uncritically by the media
Kavanaugh: This confirmation process has become a national disgrace...You have replaced advise &amp; consent with search and destroy...Frenzy on the left

RT @maggieNYT: Almost every person close to Trump who had told me having a sex crimes prosecutor question Ford was good strategy is saying…
Ford said she contacted WP anonymously in July because she was "panicking" &amp; "knew the timeline was short for the decision" in light of SCOTUS vacancy
Tweeps who don't believe Christine Ford are basically saying she's a good actress or well-coached. Many bring their own preconceptions to this kind of testimony
Commentators on Fox, CNN and MSNBC all said during the break that Ford is a credible witness. Some noted she hasn't really been pressed on her account
Durbin asks Christine Ford about 2 unnamed men who claimed they had a sexual encounter with her, not Kavanaugh. She says she is "100 percent" certain
Christine Ford says she's seen her life picked apart by people on TV, Twitter and in Congress who don't know her
Christine Ford has been overcome by emotion from the moment she started telling her story. However, the questioning goes, this is obviously very painful for her

Trump tells Fox &amp; Friends (6 am tomw) that fake news, the enemy of American people, is 80% of the media. Says NYT can't write a good story on him, "crazed," "like lunatics"
Trump tells Ainsley Earhardt (airs 6 am tomw), who asked about Michael Cohen payments to women, "Later on I knew." That contradicts Cohen's account that POTUS directed the payments
Podcast returns: The Michael Cohen guilty plea &amp; Paul Manafort conviction, media spin on both sides and rush-to-judgment speculation; plus Me-Too hypocrisy: TMZ reveals Asia Argento did have sex with a 17-year-old boy https://t.co/MoezVLDuRx

Argument is it was a secret hush money payment carried out to influence an election but not disclosed under campaign finance law https://t.co/GrvywPS3Hd
Whether that's true or not, Michael Cohen took the plea deal https://t.co/emp8nXfYvg
Michael Cohen says he paid Stormy 130K with home equity loan, which Giuliani said was personally reimbursed by Donald Trump https://t.co/1XOfUJpWjA
To those who insisted Stormy, McDougal just gossip stories, I always said it wasn't about sexual allegations but legal implications of the hush money payments
Manafort conviction, Cohen plea not about collusion. But Cohen's problematic by saying he broke campaign finance law at Trump's direction.
Cohen says he worked on behalf of candidate by arranging hush money payments for Stormy Daniels and, thru Enquirer parent co, Karen McDougal
Fox News reporting that the Michael Cohen plea deal includes 3 to 5 years of jail time
Michael Cohen told me awhile back that he didn't consider the Stormy money a campaign finance breach bec he did it to help Trump as a friend. Now he's had to plea to that charge
Breaking headlines saying Michael Cohen admits violating campaign finance law on behalf of candidate--this in the Stormy Daniels $130,000 payment
Manafort guilty on 8 of 18 counts, mistrial on the rest, still faces 2nd trial. There did seem to be a ton of financial evidence against him
Cohen plea deal. Manafort verdict reached on 8 of 18 counts. Flynn sentencing delayed. Crazy day

Could be. We haven’t seen the Cohen plea yet https://t.co/xNJtBI0mPU
Prosecutors also could have thought Michael Cohen an unreliable witness, or not have offered him enough leniency to make it an attractive deal for Trump’s former lawyer
Not clear whether Michael Cohen plea doesn’t involve cooperation because he’s still taking a bullet for Trump or prosecutors felt he had nothing of value. My guess is the latter
Michael Cohen reaches a plea deal. NYT says it involves payments to women plus bank fraud but no cooperation with prosecutors re Trump

NYT says WH counsel Don McGahn cooperated extensively w Mueller regarding Trump, concerned he might be blamed for any acts of obstruction. Sounds like McGahn wanted this out

I'm not saying they're similar, just mentioning past incidents to provide context https://t.co/vUXrPvw56a
My thoughts on Omarosa &amp; political turncoats: Do we believe what they said while on the team or now that they're cashing in on betrayal? #Mediabuzz https://t.co/bRVdIKFen3

Seems unlikely to me Trump didn't know Kelly was firing Omarosa, but regardless, her latest tape just fuels controversy and boosts her book sales
Trump slams Omarosa after Today hit: She begged me for a job, tears in her eyes, I said Ok. People in the WH hated her. She was vicious, but not smart. I would rarely see her but heard

Kimberly Giulfoyle will not be back on the air at Fox. The one-sentence statement by the network suggests to me that this was a difficult parting.
Fox statement: "Fox News has parted ways with Kimberly Giulfoyle." Nothing about her years of service or her future plans. The trigger obviously her romance with the president's son
Nothing official from Fox. But ABC says Kimberly Giulfoyle, who's dating Donald Trump Jr., is leaving &amp; expected to join pro-Trump Super PAC America First
Folks: Few care whether Trump had an affair in 2006. Fact that he's angry that Michael Cohen taped him is news, &amp; there are Qs about Trump's earlier comments on Karen McDougal

Sorry, but Rudy Giuliani, Trump's lawyer, confirmed the tape to the New York Times. So it's not unsourced https://t.co/potcxGTegB

Trump, Came back and said, What's the big deal? I realized there was a need for some clarification. Meant to say: I don't see any reason why it WOULDN'T be Russia, not would
Trump:  I accept our intel community's conclusion that Russia's meddling in the 2016 election took place...There was no collusion at all
The walkback begins: Trump says he accepts the US intelligence agencies' conclusion that Russian interference took place

Liberal commentators denouncing him as Neville Chamberlain, calling for censure &amp; impeachment, also going over the top against Trump 2/2
It's troubling that Trump wouldn't embrace his own intel agencies' findings on Russian meddling against the "strong &amp; powerful" Putin denials. But 1/2
Putin said he heard rumors about Russia having compromising info on Trump: I didn't even know he was in Moscow in 2013. Just "disregard" it
Trump: Putin was extremely strong &amp; powerful in denying Russian meddling, made an incredible offer to cooperate with Mueller on the indicted officers
Putin says Mueller can use an existing treaty between 2 countries to make a request for information in his investigation
No shock here: Putin dismisses notion of the collusion with Trump campaign as utter nonsense. Says he will look into the indictment of the 12 Russian officers
Realpolitik: Putin says it's not a matter of them trusting each other, that he and Trump defend the interests of their countries
In repeating his insistence there was no collusion, Trump declines to mention the indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers
Trump says both countries to blame for deterioration of relations, then calls Mueller probe "a disaster for our country..no collusion..I beat Hillary Clinton easily"
Trump to Putin: I'm sure we'll be meeting again in the future, often
Trump says Putin will help with North Korea nukes, is more cautious on Iran &amp; Syria, just saying they've discussed it
Trump says nothing would be easier than to criticize Russia to appease partisan critics or the media or Democrats who want to obstruct
Putin praises Trump for bringing an attitude of dialogue, not confrontation
Putin says he wants to work on peace in Syria and to help Israel's security. But of course he's propping up Assad's regime
Putin calls talks a "success" and "very fruitful." Says Cold War is over, wants to restore "trust." Mentions disarmament. But laughable that he's talking about "cybersecurity"

Why are some pundits still bashing Ivanka over the border, even saying she should quit, when she quietly worked to change her dad's mind? https://t.co/EH003omimJ
Melania Trump is at the border to visit facilities &amp; build on efforts to reunite families. She is taking a stand on a furor created by her husband's policy

Trump weighs in on Twitter, asking why “no talent” Samantha Bee hasn’t been fired for “horrible” language used against Ivanka. C-word furor continues, Twitter set to explode
As Trump melds his Twitter attacks on Mueller &amp; the media, some analysis of which are on target &amp; which miss the mark https://t.co/NilN79gQge
I said nothing of the sort. I criticized Hill, then and now https://t.co/luwNNPVIxd
TBS says it also made a mistake in airing Samantha Bee's "vile &amp; inappropriate" language against Ivanka. But apparently doesn't plan to do anything about it

AMI's Dylan Howard also tells me: "Paying for information has long been a practice of the National Enquirer and to suggest that it has only paid for, and not run, stories about any particular person is absurd"
AMI statement on New Yorker story on paying $30K to a Trump doorman: "A disconcerting view of the level of hysteria and partisanship in American politics that not reporting a story, that multiple media outlets have now also confirmed to be untrue, has become headline news"

Senators: Questions like what is hate speech, what about social media addiction, lead to philosophical answers. You need specific examples for Zuckerberg
Standing by with @TeamCavuto to analyze the Zuckerberg hearing as soon as the esteemed senators take a break
Some but not all of these lawmakers seem digitally clueless, allowing Zuckerberg to assume the role of tech professor
Most of the senators’ questions to Zuck are so vague or loosely framed that they’re not pinning down the witness. Many just reading from a script
Zuckerberg testifies in cautious monotone—we made mistakes, won’t do it again—and keeps retreating to bromides. Not really being challenged

Sure, no one's denying that. https://t.co/O3MKg4zFZL
CBS posted the transcript at 7 ET so it was news https://t.co/34lWEwDU4Y
I'm just comparing Stormy's 60 Minutes interview to the expectations that had been set by her side (and lots of media hype)
No. Starting now https://t.co/QkTwiYKbUE
I'm not saying Stormy Daniels lied about one-time sexual encounter, but she didn't produce evidence of threats or hush money on 60 Minutes
Oh, and Stormy Daniels didn't produce any photos or other documentation regarding Trump, as he lawyer implied she would
So Stormy's 2 key allegations, involving hush money &amp; alleged threat, can't be proven. She says she doesn't know who's behind them
Stormy *assumes* pressure to deny came from Trump lawyer Michael Cohen (who denies is) but doesn't know.
Stormy said she denied affair after told "they can make your life hell in many different ways." BUT NOT SURE WHO 'THEY' IS
Stormy says she took the 130K in hush money, didn't negotiate, because she was scared for family's safety. Denies she just wanted the money
This is why lawyer's tease of 60 Minutes can be out of context. Even if she was threatened, we'll never know if alleged thug connected to Trump World
The threat: Stormy says unknown man looked at her daughter &amp; said it'd be a shame if anything happened to her mom. But DUNNO WHO HE IS
Stormy says Trump raised being on the Apprentice, that she wasn't attracted to him but had consensual sex anyway
Odd that 60 Minutes would put out the Stormy Daniels transcript while show is delayed by March Madness
Something tells me the Duke-Kansas ratings on CBS just went even higher as people tune in expecting to see Stormy

Trump entitled to have his man at State. He and former Exxon chief Tillerson disagreed on several major policy issues
Tillerson seemed increasingly disconnected from WH on foreign policy. Trump likes people he's comfortable with, thus Mike Pompeo
Trump to name CIA's Mike Pompeo as secretary of State. Was obvious that he was increasingly sidelining Rex Tillerson, as on N. Korea

Trump calls for"fair compromise" on immigration, w path to citizenship for 1.8M in exchange for wall--Dems have rejected #SOTU
Trump calls for paid family leave, a key Ivanka issue. Center has moved since it was seen as Democratic liberalism #SOTU
Trump calls for big infrastructure plan, which could draw Dems, but says nothing about funding it. A broad-strokes speech #SOTU
Trade: Trump goes from Clinton's end of big govt to "the era of economic surrender is totally over" #SOTU
All the early chatter about whether Trump would stick to the script was silly #SOTU
It has become a more conventional speech, touting achievements &amp; goals, but that's what Trump needs #SOTU
Trump calls for setting aside differences, common ground--Schumer claps--the Q as always is whether there will be follow-through

Many thanks @kmax05 Howard- you do a great job. Appreciate your fair and balanced approach without an agenda
Good sourced story: WP was right about Mike Flynn lying. Bad sourced story: ABC's Brian Ross having to retract Flynn/Trump report
But media outlets must say trust us when using unnamed sources, and that trust has badly eroded in recent years
People tend to embrace sourced stories when they target the other side and denounce them when aimed at their own side
Unnamed sources are overused on political stories, but can be invaluable to investigative reporting, esp if they have documentation
Unnamed sources can be valuable. Ellsberg had documents @surfnyc	So I guess you believe #DanielEllsberg was a traitor and should’ve spent the rest of his life in jail??

RT @charliespiering Steve Bannon returned to Breitbart News as Executive Chairman of Breitbart News &amp; chaired our evening editorial meeting
NYT reports that Steve Bannon decided to resign 2 weeks ago, and announcement was delayed by Charlottesville
Bannon, Priebus, Scaramucci gone, Spicer leaving. Hard to dispute that John Kelly is having a big impact on White House staff

After two tweets about John Kelly as chief of staff, Trump thanks Reince Priebus for his service, says he's "proud" of him
Reince is out. Trump just tweeted that Homeland Secretary John Kelly is his new chief of staff. So Scaramucci was right
Scaramucci may use New York street talk, but the larger issue is whether Trump allows him to shake up the WH staff https://t.co/lb1hNQvzt0
Scaramucci, in taking on Priebus and White House leaks, is being empowered by Trump. Some profanity won't stop that https://t.co/lb1hNQvzt0
