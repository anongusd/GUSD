@daveborum @RoKhanna Taxes only levy a partial sum of wealth.
@JJussely @SandleDavid @SenSchumer Party is not relevant here. No matter what party a politician belongs to, you should consult them on issues that you care about. Exercising your voice as a constituent is a civic duty that extends beyond partisanship.
@ErikaLipton @SandleDavid @SenSchumer One Senator is not enough to confirm or deny a nominee. The process is holistic and involves every Senator.
@SexCounseling @KamalaHarris Just a quick search will show you that Senator Harris has made a stance on choice. https://t.co/zNEoig9Co0
@JohnHug18009845 @Maverick2008 Simply searching "Latino History Month" and "Native American History Month" in your search engine will bring you the results that you are looking for.
@ViolinRG85 @Ilhan Both parties have been, and still are, responsible for racism in the United States and abroad.
@SandleDavid @SenSchumer Congress has little jurisdiction over the Bureau of Prisons, which is a federal agency. Congressional oversight restricts Congress to simply overruling agency decisions and restricting agency funding, neither of which is applicable here. Please consult the appropriate politician.
