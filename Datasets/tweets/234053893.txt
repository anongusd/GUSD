Thanks for post this @FrankLuntz https://t.co/wjD5MR1hAg
@Bob_Kehoe Those arguing against the bill would tell you that the last thing impoverished countries need is less funding to combat the illegal drug production in the country. The one exception? China. If the bill can pass (and it’s unlikely in its current form) it will be need to be amended
A good word here from my friend @RepThomasMassie https://t.co/7wNlxgCUN4

Trump could be invincible if he oversees bipartisan immigration reform. His backers strongly support a wall-for-DACA deal, writes @TimmerKane https://t.co/n7Psg7mhOF
@AdamJarchow28 It’s completely unconstitutional. Go back and read article 1 and see who holds the power of the purse.
@rep89 Easy to forget what actually happened. We sued him and won in the courts multiple times. I am more concerned with what happens now, then what did or did not happen then.
It’s possible to support POTUS and desire better border security. It’s also possible, that while doing that you realize that over riding your support of those things, that your first oath, was to the constitution.
Indeed. A special thanks to one of the most principled members of Congress that I worked with. Rep. Sensenbrenner understands this better than most. https://t.co/HoCCvYNED9
Good stuff @RepGallagher. The ends should never be used to justify the means. Your vote proved today that the constitutional separation of power matters. You upheld the rule of law. https://t.co/kWkGgDfvpV
Excellent explanation of the constitutional role of the congress and President. Also a good primer for  for those wanting to understand emergency powers. WARNING - This is for the open minded only. https://t.co/dlg01KihoF

@tjo911 Maybe so for some. But after fighting for 6 years to get away from trillion dollar deficits it’s discouraging to watch congress toss away any sense of fiscal responsibility.
And yet for some reason, congress doesn’t seem to care... https://t.co/4FoZrg8QNP
@JimBillFlading Of course. It was a bad idea then as it is now. Better to make WI tax environment good for all employers rather than a chosen few.
Generally speaking, when I was in Congress I noticed that republican social engineering really isn’t any better than democrat social engineering. This kinda proves the point. https://t.co/fZHg0cPP75
In all the discussion about a wall and emergency declarations, what gets left out is the discussion about pragmatic immigration reform. POTUS was totally correct in the SOTU speech to highlight the nation's need for legal immigration. Demographics demand it. Glad he sees it.
Just another example of Congress ceding power to the President. This way they can avoid dealing with the tough issues once again. This is a bad idea. A better one would be to connect the budget to the debt limit. The problem is spending. https://t.co/NdyLKSMahe
Great convo about the Emergency Declaration. With all that said, I agree that border security is essential. It’s the necessary first step to fixing a broken immigration system.
@mikewCromwell I know what the law says. Now it’s your turn to do some research. I didn’t say he couldn’t declare an emergency, I said I was unaware of another President who used this power to reappropriate money after Congress said no.
@YochananUS I actually agree with you on DACA.
@YochananUS No fake outrage. Simply stating what I believe is allowed under the constitution. I never brought up Iran. You did. Ultimately this will all end up in the courts. Then we will see what side all things fall.
@ThriftMoments PS - he cannot reprogram an appropriation without congressional approval.
@YochananUS So the entire depth of your argument is that a Republican President can violate the constitution because a democrat, in your opinion did too? We are either a country of laws or we are not. Even when inconvenient.
@YochananUS a: It wasn’t a treaty. It was an agreement. Hence President Trump was able to withdraw. You should be happy that it wasn’t. 	b: The funds sent to Iran were Iranian funds that had been frozen in US banks, not an appropriation from congress of taxpayer dollars.
Furthermore the Courts can’t determine what an emergency is. They can only rule on the constitutional authorities as outlined therein.
Secondarily, the constitution reserves the right, in fact, vested the right, of appropriations to the congress, not to the courts or the Executive. Therefore ONLY the congress can say how money is spent. POTUS can veto the spending bill, but he can’t appropriate funds.
No, President that I am aware of has ever “Re-appropriated” money after congress clearly said no. Plus the first phrase of Article 1 gives legislative authority to congress and nothing would imply that they can simply give that right away. https://t.co/h9wvJcsblS
It should be a way higher percentage than that! https://t.co/dSXcDQECAl
Pretty sweet... https://t.co/6hYqGhtd98
Wow. Well said. https://t.co/IQFkdDcf0L
@tjo911 Doesn’t look like that way now.
@OKnox It’s easier if they don’t. When I was in congress leadership barked about article 1 powers all the time. Yet never really did anything to get power back. It’s less politically damaging to say the “The President did this/the courts did this” rather than having to decide themselves
No matter what you think of POTUS declaring an emergency it does create fascinating constitutional questions. Can the Pres “reappropriate” money by simple decree? Can a court make a determination as to what constitutes an emergency? Will congress ever take back its power?
This is really awesome. His reaction after the lift? PRICELESS! https://t.co/skjA4BSUsn
So tonight the House of Representatives will vote on a 1200 page funding bill. Giving members less than 24 hours to see what’s in it. Once again leadership has violated their own rules that require three days for members to study legislation.
@kristendel @carenbohan @USATODAY @mcollinsNEWS Kristen the tweet is really misleading. While the tax cuts can be part of the story your tweet implies it’s most of the story. SS/Medicare/interest/Medicaid are driving the vast majority of this spending increase. Revenue is actually up about 1% while SPENDING is up about 7%.

I completely agree with this. But in defense of POTUS, my guess is if Mulvaney would sign it so would he. The problem is dems won’t give anything to Trump when they would give it to another republican. That is on them. https://t.co/1ObQz83hPT

@mikecruse Have no clue other than this young lady has been good at getting attention. The bill basically calls for replacing every building in the US. That alone would cost more than $100t. Other than raising taxes and printing more money she offers no solutions. This is a naive 29yr old.
@mikecruse No the bill has not been scored and will likely never get a score by CBO. Right now it’s a messaging bill not really intended to advance. Speaker Pelosi has her own select committee working on climate so this legislation is going nowhere.
Not sure that she is even sure what she means here, but it sounds like she is saying she will use tax-payer money from across the country to pay for this. That means you America. https://t.co/AmS43BtrtE
@soledadobrien So sorry for your loss Soledad.
@FrankLuntz I agree Frank. Unfortunately POTUS only supported legislation last session that cut legal immigration. He will have to walk the talk here and not listen to the crazy voices around him.
@RichardRubinDC @RepDavid I love @RepDavid because he is absolutely right. Ideologically he and many Republicans can’t bring themselves to say that they actually will be forced to raise SS/Medicare taxes as part of but not all of the solution.
@bonewrench13 @JohnMuirWTAQ Haven’t flipped even one bit. When POTUS is right I say so. He was right on regulations, Syria, Afghanistan. He is wrong to declare an emergency to build a wall. The constitution did not give POTUS the power of the purse. It gives that power to Congress.
@bonewrench13 @JohnMuirWTAQ You are on Trump’s side. I am all in for America’s and the constitution’s side. Everyone makes choices in life. 		PS - you do realize I am not in congress right?
Tonight’s SOTU address will be just like every other one. POTUS will tout accomplishments and say many bipartisan things. It’s not about what a Pres says - it’s all about what he does afterward. The message we need is one of unity but don’t count on it.
Thank you @SenSassefor these simple but important words. https://t.co/iO8D4j94cu

One of the most important books I have ever read. Every member of congress would benefit from reading it no matter what party they are from. https://t.co/uxT0UeYevR
@salsanbluechips @justinamash The best way is to actually have illegals pay for the wall. We have a serious worker shortage in the country. If you are here illegally maybe they should charge a fine of $1k per and then let them come out of the shadows. Raises $11b a year and then we can build a fence.
@salsanbluechips @justinamash Now I have an honest question for you. Are you equally outraged that trump businesses don’t use e-verify and have regularly hired illegals while POTUS simultaneously was telling the American people that they used e-verify?
@salsanbluechips @justinamash President has power. He can veto the congress funding bill if he doesn’t like it. Gov shuts down again but that’s his choice. As far as Iran goes they got no taxpayer dollars. The money was Iranian funds that the US had previously frozen. Apples/oranges.
@salsanbluechips @justinamash It doesn’t matter what he “ campaigned” for. It only matters what congress will fund. He also “campaigned” on Mexico paying for it.  That truth is often left out. Our form of government is messy and frustrating. Allowing a President to break the law won’t fix that.
@salsanbluechips @justinamash I agree that people are sick of congress. The solution is never allowing an unconstitutional act to correct it. The congress is acting exactly the way the voters have asked the majority to act. If voters are dissatisfied they can change the congress in two years.
@salsanbluechips @justinamash I would let congress be congress. Then take my case to the people directly. Then, let the chips fall where they will. He may want a wall, but only congress can appropriate money. If the people disagree, they will correct it at the next election.
So true @justinamash . They would absolutely love it while quietly awaiting their own bite at this evil apple. https://t.co/BzZcr8Ep1Y
Two WI republican members of Congress introduced Trade legislation in the last few weeks. One abandons the constitution to give POTUS authority not his, and the other by @RepGallagher keeps his oath to defend the constitution and protect congressional rights. #WI08
3: Emergencies by their very definition call for immediate action. This is why there really is no emergency at the border. Is there a problem? Yes. Should Congress appropriate money for it? Yes. Should POTUS act without Congress? No
2. If a National emergency was declared it would be the slowest built emergency in history. Why wasn’t it an emergency a year ago? A month ago? Last week?
If republicans in Congress sit idly by while POTUS declares an emergency it would send a signal to all future Presidents that if you don’t get the money you want from Congress just take it a different way. Article 1 would be more useless than it already is.
I agree with @purduemitch. I had the opportunity to sit in the Chamber for six of these. I sat there one time and the rest I watched on closed circuit from the cloakroom. If you elect me President I promise to just mail them in rather than waste your time. https://t.co/YcpiXSR4v1

@AdamJarchow28 Don’t disagree that changes are needed. Just not the ones in this bill.
Finally while it will makes it harder to seek asylum in the U.S. it provides Israel with $5,000,000.00 to assist refugees seeking to relocate in Israel.
It will be couched as a safety change for those seeking asylum. It allows asylum to be sought in your home country. This is mostly unworkable because of the threat of violence there. It appears to be a back-door way to drastically cut asylum opportunities.
I have had a chance now to read the Senate appropriation to reopen government. Everything was mostly ok (other than the ridiculous amount of spending) until the asylum piece. Massive changes in how asylum seekers will be treated. This would be tough to support.
@scooterupnorth Fair enough. And I agree. Yet they were tied going into OT. At that point it’s a new game. They got beat there.

I do feel bad for N.O. Saint football fans today. However, to bring some balance to the discussion they did have an opportunity to redeem that bad call by preventing LA from scoring in OT. The game was decided there.

@crevier What I believe is that you put enforcement triggers on congress. Things like no budget no pay. You also could withhold all congressional recesses. Don’t let anyone leave and maybe they would get their work done. No vacations without appropriations. Things like that.
If you believe we actually have a crisis at the border then you must agree that the fine people at the Department of Homeland Security and the various departments in DHS should be paid while dealing with it. The men and women shouldn’t be held hostage by politics.
@MikeJMacco I didn’t say give the keys to the kids either.
@salsanbluechips @SenMikeLee I am ok with more border security. It does nothing to solve the underlying problem. But if it makes people feel better so be it. At least then they might get serious about the real problem.
@SenMikeLee Actually Senator what we need is rational immigration policy. All the wall building represents is treatment of a symptom not the disease. Fix immigration policy and you fix the border.
After watching the tv circus tonight on immigration I came to one conclusion. We need younger leaders.
@mitchell_hanke Indeed it has. So the next step is to “speak” at the voting booth. The ultimate power is the one voters hold.
@WPJohnWagner Sorry that what she said was a distraction as opposed to being sorry for saying something stupid and offensive?

With roughly 25% of the House being new members, why should they be asked to vote for a funding measure that they have not been given a chance to even read or more importantly understand? Follow your new rules and give them 72 hours.
2. The House will then vote to ignore the very rules they just voted on so they can move legislation to reopen the govt this week. The new folks in charge will run it like the old ones did. You just can’t make this stuff up!

@FergieRebellion Ryan I get the frustration. The bigger point here is that the amount of money being asked for, if actually used correctly for real border security, will likely save many billions more than the actual cost. If it all goes for a wall then yes it will be wasted.
@marathontrucker @JimBillFlading This is why mandatory e-verify is needed. But it must be coupled with a guest worker program. Also you must apply it to consumers or undocumented workers will go direct to the customer.
@JimBillFlading I was very active in trying to find common ground on immigration. Republican colleagues were simply not willing. Some opposed the policy, others were fearful of the base. As far as tax cuts go, I was not in congress for that vote as I had already retired.
@SykesCharlie Don’t worry Charlie. I think I still remember you....kinda.
@rpalme01 Haha. Yea maybe a little bored...
@MadLawReview I get that. Many people simply don’t want to give in to Trump. He can provoke that response and often does. It’s a shame because it keeps us from being able to move forward at our own expense.
Finally stop saying we have an immigration crisis. We don’t. Here is what a real crisis looks like - It’s when no one wants to come here, not when too many do. People want to immigrate here for a reason. If that stops we have a real problem. Rant complete.
10. National demographics demand a fix. We have declining birth rates and an aging work force. Denying the numbers will only make things worse. Practical immigration reform is an essential part of our economic needs. Frankly it’s a part of who we have always been.
9. Rational immigration reform will make it easier to immigrate the right way while more difficult to immigrate the wrong way. Make it rational to do the right thing and people will be more likely to do it that way. That is not the case as it stands right now.
8. Recognize that children brought here illegally by parents did not break the law. DACA should be dealt with along with a border security package. Having a bunch of young people that can’t plug into the economy makes no sense. For them or us.
7. You allow those who are employed and drug/crime free to stay by purchasing a work permit for $1k per year. They forfeit the right to become citizens unless they return to their country of origin and get back in line. This will generate $8-$10b per year and reduce crime.
6. No, 10 million undocumented workers will not self deport nor can we deport them. It’s uncomfortable to admit this truth but essential. So after the border is secure these folks should be brought into the light of day. Otherwise a underground economy will continue.
5. Yes there are jobs Americans simply do not want to do....and there always have been. We must recognize this so real reform to our immigration system will actually work and meet those needs. Merit counts. So do strong backs and a willingness to use them.
4. Interior enforcement should be part of a larger immigration reform which includes mandatory e-verify for employment making it more difficult for employers. This MUST be coupled with reasonable guest worker policy to meet labor demands in a growing economy.
3. A border wall is needed in some places but not all. That’s why POTUS is talking more about “border security.” This should include measures to minimize visa/passport over stays with much more strict penalties when they occur.
2. Congress will spend the money anyway. Might as well get started now. Nothing else can happen on bigger reforms without it. It’s going to cost some money and the $5b is not an unreasonable amount.
It’s time for congress and the administration to actually get serious about immigration. Border Security (which includes physical barriers in some places,) is needed as part of a larger reform effort. It is rightly step 1.
@MikeJMacco Ultimately our presence there provided little stability. I really am ok with bringing our folks home. I felt however that the entire approach was wrong. Leaving allies in the lurch and not communicating our plans with allies was wrong.
Beto makes a case here and one worth considering. The real fix for illegal immigration is a legal immigration system that works. https://t.co/xz5cU5NuAj

@flyjdp Yup. I agree.
This is so annoying. There were 16 other republican candidates in the primary, 3 or 4 dem candidates and the implication is basically the majority of candidates violate the law? That’s nonsense and a slam against those who were disadvantaged because they were honest! https://t.co/ZDka6D9iOt

@HarrySteinDC I agree with you there. Sen. McConnell needs his own “sit-down” with the President to help him navigate a better result.
@HarrySteinDC I get that Harry. But you know as well as me that CR’s are no way to govern or manage. It’s an out that politicians use to avoid tough decision making. Governance takes work.
The Trump, Pelosi, Schumer, "made for tv" debacle yesterday demonstrates why we need new leadership in DC. Not once did anyone offer a compromise position, an alternative to break deadlock, a meaningful reform idea for immigration. Just a lot of pretend fighting - no winners.

@mitchell_hanke Citizens are getting both what they pay for and what they vote for. I would be happy to pay double if I had better candidates to choose from.
@mitchell_hanke You and I often agree and I certainly enjoy the friendly and courteous discussions we have. I disagree here. Members are responsible for managing over $4t of spending and an economy of $18t. They earn their pay. In fact they should be paid more.

@jackdoranjr I will take your advice to “be better”. It’s a fair request. However, no one ever said I had ODS when I challenged 44’s leadership issues. But you too should not just follow blindly, less you become what you accuse me of.

@KellerSFrizzle @kevinbinversie Such a kind person you are. And yet here you are still hanging on my every word. You are just a another Trump only in a blue shirt. Angry, mean and ill informed. If you don’t like what I say stop listening. You will certainly feel better and I won’t miss a thing.
@KellerSFrizzle @kevinbinversie Coming from you I will consider this a compliment.
@kevinbinversie So true. My own premium went up over $1k per month. My subsidy didn’t go up at all. Ocare is great if you are young like her. Expensive for old guys like me.
@kevinbinversie Yea. She probably didn’t earn $174,000.00 a year either but I don’t hear her complaining about that. If she is legit she will equally distribute her pay to her former colleagues.
@Arc7Angle The one who sees clearly. You on the other hand...maybe can’t see at all. Keep looking though. Eventually you may find that goodness, humility, strength are the keys to great leaders.
I believe that humility matters in leaders. The gap between 41 and 45 is so large as to be a chasm. Genuinely humble people are often that way because they are secure in the knowledge of how others view them. Those that aren’t cannot see it.

9. And citizens will never really know where their member of congress actually stands on issues like immigration reform. Social Security and Medicare reform etc, etc. 		End of rant....
8. When this happens, then every American citizen can be equally represented and will know exactly what their member of congress believes. Absent these changes, members will never be allowed to fix the big problems because the leadership will never let them vote for the fixes.
7. Leaders who at every level are selected by the members. This includes committee chairs. This is the only way to return power to the members. This makes every leader subject to the members who select them, rather than subject to the Speaker who can control them.
The House needs ALL NEW leadership. Leaders who will stop treating members as back benchers but as equal partners in this great American experiment.
The Speaker always feel like they must protect their members from taking difficult votes. This is nonsense. There are no difficult votes for members who stay in touch with their constituents and willingly speak for them when they vote.
4. When the Speaker gets out of the way. When they yield power back to the members, the great wisdom of the people will filter through their elected officials and they will be heard. This requires a Speaker to give up their own power in favor of the people.
3. The Speaker should be the Speaker of the Whole House, not just the political party they represent. The parties already have majority and minority leaders. Let them handle party politics. The Speaker should simply call balls and strikes.
2. The only way for voter voices to be heard is when the Speaker allows Members to vote. Right now, and also when Pelosi was Speaker, they sought to protect their members rather than protect the people, by using the rules to rig the result.
.@GStephanopoulos the discussion on Speaker of the House is all wrong. What the Country needs is a Speaker of incredible character that will actually allow the House to work it’s will. That is the ONLY way to fix what’s broken.

@dmwoof I am out of Congress so I have no dog in this fight. But let me ask you this. If your boss never gave you a raise or cost of living increase for 10 yrs, what would you think of your boss?
@dmwoof They pay into the Social Security System, just like you. They have a 401k should they choose to contribute to it. They pay into the normal federal pension system and can earn a pension that pays out starting at age 62. House members must serve three terms to get a 10% pension.
@DaveBenforado @reidribble Fair point Dave. It’s difficult to use straight extrapolations because the type of pay has begun to change as the new generation is more interested in benefits vs pay. Still very interesting topic.
Good and fair take on growing income. Want to know what class of citizen has not seen any income growth for a full decade? Zero, zip, nothing. Members of Congress - whose pay has been frozen in place since 2009.  Maybe we are getting what we pay for? https://t.co/FTvcegEDNx

@IOWamp @RepGallagher Exactly right. The current system overly favors the citizens from Kentucky and soon from CA over all others when leadership rules from the top down. Votes are the ONLY WAY citizens  voices are heard. Stop protecting members and start protecting voters!
@MikeJMacco It’s the status quo. It’s what they ALL do. Protect everyone from difficult votes and then do very little. It’s no wonder Americans despise them. The citizens have lost their representative voice.
And this is the problem when leadership holds too much power. Bills with bipartisan and Presidential support deserve a vote. If members don’t like the bill their solution is to vote no. Politics is no reason for not having a vote. https://t.co/FiOAAqh7TU

@mitchell_hanke Only partially. Fixing the medical stuff in a way that reduces cost saves money in Medicare/Medicaid. But economists also show an offset due to longevity in both medicare and social security from people living longer. Either way, reforms need to happen in that space for sure.

@MarcGoldwein Excellent work and very important work. Thanks Marc.
@MarcGoldwein Kind words. I agree except that most “pay-fors” were much less likely to actually happen. Also, on the tax extenders analysis, did you consider the cross-over that the new tax bill caused in this area. Just making sure it wasn’t double counted.
This is mostly right. The doc fix portion would have been paid without regard to the permanent fix congress did in 2015. The money is the same as it would have been. The fix made it certain and protected Medicare/aid patients by insuring a doctor would actually take them. https://t.co/RhjeO3nXBy
@hrenj Yea. Things like war and what not.
Hmmm. Interesting. https://t.co/vao8o1tPaP
Sec Mattis cites article II as authorization because the civil war could escalate threatening US security interests. Under this broad interpretation POTUS could go to war anywhere anytime. This argument also discounts/circumvents Article I powers.
The current authorization allowed the US to go after terrorists after 9/11. It does NOT give a blanket authorization to go after a country involved in a civil war. The cause POTUS laid out may be a noble one. Should have been easy to get congress to give ok.
@aaronweinschenk You are correct. In this case congress may have agreed with POTUS and simply authorized the action. He said it will be “sustained” meaning as long as needed. Sounds like war.
@flyjdp And the leadership in Congress does not want to make members choose. They are protecting themselves by not voting rather than protecting our representative system of government.
The President’s authority to strike Syria does not exist absent authorization from Congress. The current authorization is based on an AUMF that is nearly two decades old. Without regard to whether Syria should pay a price for using chem weapons. Only congress can declare war.

@ballajd To be more clear. It will take both. More and better trained  workers from here and abroad. Demographics are our destiny.
@ballajd Go back and read the article. We have an aging population, that combined with decreasing birth rates has put us in a demographics decline. Yes, training can help. But there simply are not enough workers to sustain a growing economy over time.
@ballajd Your’re right. But most immigrants come, and as they have done for more than two centuries, assimilate to our culture making us the “great melting pot” we have become. “E Pluribus Unum”, is a valid today as it has always been.
@flyjdp Totally agree with you.

@jasonlknoll I completely agree with you here. My point was that it is clear that changes to gun laws and mental health funding may take years and years to impact society. The changes we have been discussing could be implemented now. Saving lives now.
@jasonlknoll Fortress is probably too strong of a word. But I would be willing to bet if you asked the loved ones of this weeks victims what they would prefer, I am pretty sure what they would answer. They probably would not view it as a fortress but a place of safety.
@jasonlknoll This goes to the heart of my original tweet. We MUST change the discussion to one of values. We can always find the money for what we value. We claim we value our children but our spending  on security tells a very different story.
@jasonlknoll We heard similar thoughts about turning airports into fortresses. (I might have even made that claim) Yet today we see it as normal.
@jasonlknoll Gonna take some work and nothing is 100% foolproof. Limit entry to just a few of the ten sets. Cameras on the remainder. And yes we will need additional staff/trained security. We do this all over the place. Eventually people adapt and get comfortable with it.
@jasonlknoll That’s true. But no more so than the existing system. Kids congregate together in and out of school now. Lines can be dramatically reduced by staggering start times and entry points. That exposure exists now w/o detectors.
@jasonlknoll Jason, thanks for joining the conversation. You can’t go to a Packer game w/o walking through a metal detector. There are police liaison officers at many schools already. Parents/admin/teachers know what they will accept. I am saying look there first.
@mitchell_hanke We all can Mitch. I think it’s high time we start talking about it. Maybe the conversation can spur some action.
@LauraCanaday23 Two ways. Gather enough votes to scare them about their seats. Find quality candidates to run against them. I do feel though that this could be handled locally where grassroots involvement is most effective.
@jcon16 I was thinking the exact same thing! Thanks for sharing your thoughts!
@LauraCanaday23 Laura that is what this conversation is about. Challenging our values. We SAY we value our children more than anything. I know I do and am willing to help pay for security at my grandchildren’s school.
@jcon16 Like I said you and I are not far apart. I agree with you on almost all of things you propose above. Basic, simple and can be helpful.
@jcon16 Sure. But you know the difference tactically between full and semi automatic. AR-15 is a semi automatic rifle like many other long rifles. Joseph is really don’t disagree all that much with you regarding the guns. I just don’t think policy makers will do it.
@flyjdp Clearly...
I don’t disagree with you. But the idea that someone who is violent won’t just go get a different rifle and do the same thing I think is wrong. Violent people will always find tools of violence. I just don’t believe it will solve the problem. https://t.co/TslpsMPgPm
@jcon16 What I am saying is that we have more control over this issue than we want to believe. If it takes me saying something extreme to get people actually talking about effective solutions (and banning assault rifles will not stop a single event) then so be it.
.@BillKristol https://t.co/UvOZJor0rS
If we wait for policy makers for a solution to violence we all will be disappointed. If we take control of security on a local level, with parental support and a commitment to pay for it it can be done before schools ends in May. #endtheviolencenow
@ShawnFetta Sure. Could be both. Or could be better control at entry ways. Or other ideas. Our school districts are lead by a lot of smart people. Citizen boards alongside paid administrators can chart a local path forward on security. Then appropriate funds to do it.
@ShawnFetta Read the second tweet again. You will find it there.
@imdvm Read the second tweet again. You will find it there.
This is the real solution. Is it costly? Yes. Is it effective? Yes. Is it worth it? Yes
2/2 But we do really value our children? Maybe if we did we would put adequate security there. Like we do with other things we value. The fact that we don’t and instead seek cheaper alternatives is a recognition that maybe we simply value money more.
Is it possible we are talking about the wrong solution? Banning assault rifles is an overly simplified response to school shootings. Our society protects what it values. It values the airline industry. It values gov. officials. It values our national museums.

@bigpieps if the prices they charge are easy to determine more people could "shop" for some services. Right now prices are hidden.

@dickensgirl @JoyAnnReid but that should not be read as me saying govt should not assist.
@dickensgirl @JoyAnnReid what I said however had nothing to do with that. I responded that Jesus never called on govt to feed the poor.
@dickensgirl @JoyAnnReid well it's been interesting to read all the tweets. I personally believe there is a role for govt in welfare.

Up bright and early this morning talking #SOTU with @rhornacek at  @fox11news ! https://t.co/WavWWI9tXM
....this #SOTU doesn't seem shorter.
I agree with @POTUS on redistricting reform--we must work together to end #gerrymandering. #SOTU #SOTU16
The President could reduce money in politics this year by stopping his fundraising operation.
Mr. President, it is not what you say today, it will be about what you do tomorrow. #SOTU
The discussion on democracy is hard to take given POTUS's history of separating and dividing Americans. #SOTU
.@POTUS calls for working together after seven years of divisive actions. Too little too late sir. #SOTU #SOTU16
.@POTUS says he will shut down #Gitmo. That would violate the NDAA which he himself signed into law. #SOTU
"We helped Ukraine defend its democracy." That statement would surprise many Ukrainians. #SOTU
And as we speak, #Iran holds ten American sailors. #SOTU #SOTU16
Mr. President, if you need an #AUMF from Congress, on what authority have you been making 10,000 air strikes? #SOTU
If ISIL is not a threat Mr. President then why have you used 10,000 air strikes? #SOTU
"Russia is poring in resources to prop up Ukraine." Wow, that's a new take on a bad situation. #SOTU
"The U.S. is the strongest nation on earth"--agreed. Yet we need both capability and the WILL to use it for it to matter. #SOTU #SOTU16
President cites space exploration but has been pretty much opposed to it during his time in office #SOTU
The best welfare is a good job not a tax credit. #SOTU
While talking about #Obamacare he leaves out the fact that Americans are forced by law to get insurance-not because they can afford it #SOTU
The President continues to promise two years of free community college while offering no suggestions to pay for it. #SOTU16 #SOTU
Companies have less loyalty to their communities? Not in my experience. #SOTU
It sounds like the President has read @SpeakerRyan's book
Each time there have been those who told us to fear the future...each time we overcame it. -@POTUS #SOTU
This final #SOTU will be a little shorter. Large applause!

Silence is not acceptable.
Who is entitled to speak for Islam? The many millions of Muslims who believe Islam is a religion	of tolerance&amp;virtue must find their voice.

The parents of the 3 million girls newly able to learn in Afghanistan's primary schools thank you.
In September of 2001, it was illegal to educate girls in #Afghanistan. Now more than 3 million learn in primary school.
US Soldiers are no longer engaged in direct combat in Afghanistan. - @ashrafghani

7) You cannot create increased wages for the middle class by taxing the activity that creates increased wages for the middle class.
6) You cannot unify Americans by creating more division via the tax code.
5) You cannot lower the cost of higher education by offering colleges more federal dollars.
4) You can't create more entrepreneurial investment &amp; small biz by taxing the $$ that creates entrepreneurial investment &amp; grows small biz.
3) You cannot lower costs on American middle class families by raising the cost of the things middle class families purchase.
2) You cannot help save the family farm in WI by raising the death tax on family farmers.
