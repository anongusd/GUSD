A silly border wall that wastes taxpayer money makes no sense. We need greater investment into the Alliance for Prosperity, into our law enforcement efforts, and into diplomacy to ensure less corrupt and more responsive governments.		We can solve this with smart solutions. 8/
The most effective way for us to deal with unwanted immigration is to address the root causes in the developing economies of the Northern Triangle.		We have already made a significant difference, but there is so much more we can and must do. 7/
We saw, again and again, that when we help create conditions of the most modest prosperity, when we reduce the fear of imminent violence, and when folks believe things will get better -- well, no one wants to emigrate to the United States. 6/ https://t.co/LqZPI0pIN4
Our top concern was the decline in presidential support for US initiatives, and the naive idea that a wall on a border 1,000+ miles north will be a disincentive for jobless people living in fear of violence.		The idea that a wall is the answer was not borne out by what we saw. 5/

Leaving aside President Trump's unconstitutional actions, his contempt for the rule of law, this illegal power grab, etc, if you watched that press conference it's pretty clear that even Trump himself does not believe there is a national emergency. https://t.co/vIuZsmFLmH
President Trump, just now, on his declaration of a national emergency:		"I didn't need to do this."
The President, on the projects funded by the money he would illegally raid to build the wall he promised Mexico would pay for: 		"It didn't sound too important to me,"		Here's what "didn't sound too important" to him: https://t.co/K4cnEnuhcO
This bizarre, rambling speech about everything that passes through the President's mind is not exactly conveying the sense of urgency which most people would associate with a national emergency
The national emergency in Trump's mind is not at the border, it's that he can't deliver his promise that he would build a wall and Mexico would pay for it.		Meanwhile 2/3 of independents and even 1/3 of Republicans do not think he should use a national emergency to build a wall. https://t.co/itGtgpf6W5

RT @Fritschner: The House will PLEASE be in order! https://t.co/HNWkUmjsKo
In that vein, I look forward to passing a long term funding bill later this evening to keep the government open and avert yet another shutdown. The appropriations package isn't perfect, but this deal contains major victories for our priorities and will take us forward. 3/3
This is the House version of @timkaine's Senate bill. 		Shutdowns are destructive for the federal workforce and the country, and no good ever comes from them. 		The President and Congress need to be able to resolve their differences without damaging the country on purpose. 2/
I just introduced the End Shutdowns Act, which would fill any lapse in appropriations with an automatic continuing resolution and stop the House from considering non-emergency bills until Congress agrees on a government-funding measure. With @RepRaskin: https://t.co/kgt97cKeje 1/ https://t.co/I6nk9XYJIh
It is rare to have legislative solutions that could prevent disasters of the scope of Parkland or Virginia Tech, and rarer still to have bipartisan support for those measures. Both are the case for this bill. 		Congress should pass the ERPO Act with all possible haste. 7/7
In Virginia @RipSullivan48 has introduced an ERPO bill; we are pushing this federal solution to encourage states to pass them. 		To see if your state has an ERPO law (aka gun violence restraining order or "red flag" law) check this @teamtrace chart: 6/ https://t.co/Z7gezc6qZv https://t.co/lw28TfX0cI
...and that data doesn't even include California, which has some of the best ERPO programs (for instance in San Diego) in the country.		Our bill, led by @RepCarbajal @RepTedDeutch @RepBrianFitz in the House and @SenFeinstein in the Senate, would boost those numbers even more. 5/
In the year since Parkland, the number of states with ERPO laws has doubled, and most of these new laws were signed by Republican governors.		During that time 1,700+ orders for seizures of firearms from people who posed an imminent threat were issued. 4/ https://t.co/bvscKmIJqV
These laws would reduce suicide and gun violence while protecting due process rights, which is why this act has had bipartisan support stretching from progressives like @SenWarren &amp; @SenKamalaHarris to conservatives like @VP Pence.		This approach is just common sense. 3/
The Extreme Risk Protection Order Act would nurture state-level passage of ERPO laws, which allow family or law enforcement to temporarily restrict access to guns for people who demonstrate a threat to themselves or others, as the Parkland shooter did. 2/	https://t.co/NnrbfbihUt
One of the most tragic thing about the mass shooting that claimed 17 lives at Parkland one year ago is that it was preventable.		We could have saved those lives with better laws.		Today we reintroduced ERPO legislation to prevent future shootings where there are warning signs. 1/ https://t.co/Ckb2YawWgM

Given this new information about Jared Kushner, the Administration's ongoing refusal to abide by longstanding security clearance processes and its unwillingness to explain its actions to Members of Congress increasingly looks like a cover up. 9/

In July 2017, we also asked a series of questions regarding the status of White House Senior Advisor Ivanka Trump’s security clearance. These questions, too, remain unanswered by the Trump Administration. 6/ https://t.co/5RPHjymaTR
Congress is now in the impossible position of wondering who the 30 officials who received clearances despite being rejected by career security officials are, what ‘unfavorable information’ was in their records, and why they still have ongoing access to sensitive information. 5/

This shutdown accomplished nothing. It inflicted extreme pain on the people I represent without reason.		As the President approaches the new deadline he just agreed to for the expiration of government funding, he must think of people besides himself. This must never happen again.
He could have spared the country the scenes of its public sector workers waiting in lines for food banks, airports shut down and tax returns jeopardized, national parks closed, and so many other essential services halted.
Trump could have spared 800,000 federal employees the suffering caused by missed paychecks, rent payments, medical procedures, and every other deprivation that came with 35 days of no pay.

It is good that Congress could at least agree on these measures, but these are steps that can only undo - eventually - some of the massive damage being done to the country by this shutdown. Congress and the White House MUST the shutdown and reopening the government. 6/6
While the legislation which passed Congress today would cover only employees on the government payroll, I have also cosponsored the bicameral bill introduced in the House by Congresswoman @EleanorNorton to grant back pay to federal contractors. 5/
I appreciate Senator @timkaine's work to bring this legislation to the Senate floor, where he was assured by Senate Republican leaders that it would pass and subsequently be signed into law. 4/
It is vital that the Senate take up the bipartisan legislation which has already passed previously in both chambers to end the shutdown and reopen the government. 		Every day this shutdown continues will do lasting damage to the federal workforce and the country. 3/
This is a critical step towards undoing some of the damage caused by the government shutdown, but while this legislation will provide federal employees with the certainty that they will eventually be paid, that cannot happen until the shutdown ends. 2/
The House just passed the Senate companion version of my bill (with @RobWittman) to give federal employees back pay from the shutdown. 		The bill, introduced in the Senate by @SenatorCardin, was approved by the House with near-unanimous bipartisan support. 1/
Thousands of federal employees are getting a pay stub today for $0.00.		This Trump shutdown is crushing the federal workforce, dramatically undercutting the crucial services they provide, and making the country weaker and less safe. 		ENOUGH. 	https://t.co/aTXGPFxysq https://t.co/K06bjdY8PN

Trump tweeted, he pitched tantrums, and he gave an address. Nowhere did he give any reason why the government should remain shut down.		Every day he refuses to end this shutdown and reopen the government worsens this man-made disaster for our region and our country. It must end.

I've gotten hundreds of calls and letters, and they overwhelmingly oppose the shutdown.		I've heard from people living in anguish and fear, not knowing where the money is going to come from to pay for their tuition, their rent, their groceries, or their health care.

A week ago the National Climate Assessment made it clear that climate change is killing Americans and costing billions of dollars.		Trump and his Cabinet have spent the week engaging in willful ignorance of scientific findings, and now they are pushing more dirty energy. 5/
Even in a time of economic hardship the risks posed by Trump's actions would outweigh the benefits.		There is absolutely no justification for intentionally welcoming this kind of damage at a time when oil prices are low and fossil fuel corporations are posting record profits. 4/
These are just some of the reasons why coastal states, communities, small businesses, political leaders from both parties, and the United States Navy all stand united in opposition to drilling, seismic blasting, and invasive petroleum exploration in the Atlantic Ocean. 3/
Seismic blasting poses a major threat to marine life, including the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale, which is on the verge of extinction.		The potential for harm to marine life from blasting and drilling also poses a serious danger to the coastal economies. 2/
Since Donald Trump has decided to ignore the concerns of residents and stakeholders directly impacted by seismic blasting and offshore drilling, it is time for Congress to step in and put a stop to this by passing my bill, the Atlantic Seismic Airgun Protection Act. 1/ https://t.co/TBM3cMcrhN

This week #NationalSuicidePreventionWeek and throughout the month of September #SuicideAwarenessMonth I hope you will look at what we are learning about suicide in America, and think about ways that you can support friends and loved ones at risk. All of us can help. 10/10
CDC data also point to guns as a risk factor.	https://t.co/XeUeq3MUE2	Half of suicides are committed with a gun.	https://t.co/f9paFBC2eC	Studies show legislation like our #GVROAct which allow the removal of guns from people in crisis can reduce suicide. 9/	https://t.co/ey3HBDz0p9
State-level policies are key when it comes to funding for mental health services. Many of those funds flow through Medicaid, and I'm thrilled that Virginia has finally expanded the program, which will do so much when it comes to mental health. 8/ https://t.co/5aFy5HtYIe
We can help with policy. The rise in suicide followed a decline in mental health services. https://t.co/noksuwLR9r	I formed the bipartisan suicide prevention caucus in Congress to help address this. 	https://t.co/efw56vPKVF	We are making some progress. https://t.co/kQpr8T971G 7/
We can help those who need it get help. 		I recently visited a crisis center where they take calls from a suicide prevention hotline. These people are trained professionals who help save lives. https://t.co/0ftzdfYBPM	6/
So here are some things we can do to help.	https://t.co/45ourVf8Jy		Awareness, identifying risk signs, and talking about them are essential. We have all been touched by mental illness among our family and friends; we can help end the stigma. 5/ https://t.co/Xlug1EpDru
Despair is also driving huge increases in the number of people who die by overdose. https://t.co/l1AxwQo3qU		We must not respond to people who feel hopeless by pretending they don't exist or that they don't have problems. Compassion and communication are essential. 4/
In addition to veterans, more new groups are also starting to show heightened suicide risk:	- Young women https://t.co/yrs8Z5pFNL	- Black children https://t.co/m49hgQMdh5	- Farmers https://t.co/0Wr0iZV4Fk 	Most of us probably know someone who has experienced suicidal thoughts. 3/
First a few notes on the problem, and what we've learned in recent months.		A new CDC shows that the incidence of suicide in the US has risen sharply, by about 30% over the past two decades. 2/ https://t.co/og6nm3YfIm

These reports may well reveal new details about wrongdoing by Scott Pruitt and the rest of Donald Trump’s cabinet.		The country needs leaders who will act, and the American people deserve a Congress that is not afraid to clean up the Trump culture of corruption. 3/3
The Pruitt saga illustrates how sorely we need real oversight to check the President, while Republicans in Congress act as a rubber stamp for the Trump Administration’s worst excesses.		This IG report is the tip of the iceberg; many more such reports are likely to follow. 2/

GOP leaders are not holding hearings on any of Trump's cabinet corruption.		Speaker Ryan saying he didn't even know about Pruitt' corruption is the perfect symbol of how they shrug off oversight.		And that's why scandals like Pruitt's get so bad. 10/10 https://t.co/hGo8GLyfcw
Of course, it is not the least bit surprising that Trump would surround himself with corrupt people like Pruitt who care little about ethics or conflicts of interest.		They reflect Donald Trump himself, who profits from his office every day. 9/ https://t.co/bbNDn68p3i

Scott Pruitt stood out for his unprecedented corruption, mismanagement, and scandal, and Donald Trump's toleration of them.		But Pruitt was not alone in Trump's Cabinet of corruption.

Trump said reporters are “the enemy of the people.” That is only true if “the people” in question are corrupt officials.		Our minority opposition, our organizational groundwork, our grassroots activism all depends on a free press.		It has never been more important than now. 5/5
By the end, Pruitt was the subject of nearly 20 federal investigations. 		I requested several of them, and many others were sought by colleagues. If you look, you will see that the core information in every letter and IG request has a footnote with a citation to a news story. 4/
And most importantly, journalists stepped up.		In the age of Pruitt it was reporters, not Congressional Committees, which found the truth, and reported it to the American people. 		They did so in the face of relentless secrecy and occasional abuse from Pruitt and his people. 3/
Republicans in Congress demonstrated that they are incapable of governing.		But the public still learned about what Pruitt did, thanks to organizations who fought Pruitt’s attacks on the environment with lawsuits which revealed his coordination with polluters and lobbyists. 2/
Never forget: faced with one of the most corrupt Cabinet members in history, GOP leaders shrugged.		They did nothing to hold Scott Pruitt accountable.		They held no hearings, laughed off oversight, and in the Speaker’s case, claimed they didn’t even know it was happening. 1/
The only way to really turn the page on the Pruitt era will be for Trump to appoint an EPA Administrator who is committed to environmental stewardship, and willing to clean house and wrest control of the EPA back from polluters and lobbyists.
Scott Pruitt's scandals were inextricably linked to his antipathy to environmental protection, and to his close association with those who value profit over clean air and water.
Scott Pruitt stood out, even in Donald Trump’s uniquely corrupt administration, for his willingness to cede direct influence and control over EPA policy to industries and special interests which harm public health.
Pruitt joins the growing ranks of ex-Trump officials, a testament to Trump’s chaotic management style and poor judgment.		Some who remain may be nearly as corrupt, as antithetical to the purposes of the agencies they lead, as willing to engage in dishonest and unethical behavior.
Pruitt acknowledged behavior in hearings and TV interviews that violated federal regulations and spoke to extreme levels of wasteful spending and abuse of public office.		He committed dozens of offenses which would have led to immediate dismissal in any previous administration.
Scott Pruitt was able to keep his position for so long -- despite astonishing megalomania and unethical behavior – only because of Donald Trump’s historic embrace of corruption.

Family separation is wrong, and I will be working with my colleagues in Congress to stop it.		We should have zero tolerance for destroying families. /end/
There isn't a law requiring Trump to do this, previous presidents did not have zero tolerance policies that led to this kind of family separation.		They did not punish asylum-seekers at the border like Trump and Sessions are doing, intentionally.
The Trump Administration is losing people, and causing parents unable to even talk to their children for months. It's a moral outrage.		I am committed to stopping it, and so are huge numbers of my constituents who are calling to voice their anger and dismay every day.
Yesterday DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen couldn't answer questions about where small children are, and ICE couldn't tell us either today. 		It's clear that the Administration was unprepared for their own zero tolerance policy and inflicted awful tragedy on parents as a result.
The agency arresting people at the border isn't telling the agency responsible for the children or the (different) agency responsible for holding their parents who is in whose family.		As a result families are going months without speaking to each other and suffering horribly.
The prison officials and ICE officers there did not have information on which of the people detained there had children, let alone any information on where those children are or how to contact them.		This is inflicting a huge amount of unnecessary suffering on people.
One of the biggest problems we discovered, surprisingly and unexpectedly, is that CBP, which detained these fathers and thousands of others every year at the border, apparently does not share records about family of detainees with ICE, even though both are agencies within DHS.
That's what Carlos and Mario told us.		Both of these young fathers were in tears (as were some of us) throughout our conversation. 		Both were deeply worried about their children.		Both said they do not have legal counsel.
Then Mario said an officer approached him and told him to give up his daughter, or she would be taken away.		He said his 5-year-old girl was dragged away from him crying and screaming, which was the last he saw her, and the last time he was able to speak to her for over a month.
Mario took buses from Honduras and up through Mexico with his 5-year-old daughter.		They crossed the border and surrendered to CBP, which placed them together in an "ICE box" facility (fenced-in indoor centers which are kept extremely cold) in April for three days.
The other father was named Mario, also from Honduras.		Mario's sister was a victim of domestic violence committed by a former policeman. When they attempted to press charges through the legal system, he was attacked and beaten up by a gang of 4-5 men. They fled the country.
Carlos told us he was imprisoned for 1-2 days, chained in leg irons with his son next to him, and then separated from his son and transferred here.		He was unable to talk to his son for 3 months until last week when the boy contacted his grandmother, whose number he'd memorized.
The first was a young man named Carlos. Carlos fled gang violence in Honduras with his 7-year-old-son by train, and surrendered himself at the border in El Paso to CBP in March.		The kind of story you hear often about asylum-seekers.
With help @CAIRCoalition we identified 2 fathers held there who had been separated from their children and uncertain of their status.		After meeting with ICE and local officials, we spent an hour talking to these fathers, agreeing not to use their full names for their protection.
We went to this facility in Anne Arundel County to get a sense of what was happening with family separation at the border. 		I want to say up front I appreciate the federal and county officials who worked with my staff to arrange this visit, and to @Call_Me_Dutch for welcoming us
Today I visited an ICE detention facility outside Baltimore with @Call_Me_Dutch.
