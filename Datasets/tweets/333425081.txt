I want to underscore the @BigBendNPS angle hinted at by today‚Äôs #nationalemergency declaration. https://t.co/705fh4NGYe
Here it is.		1. Watch out for Interior giving away strips of Big Bend to DOD, allowing military construction there under 2808.		2. Note that Interior &amp; DoD led by mere Acting Secretaries. More dependent should = less judicial deference to steps they take.	https://t.co/tk4wfZRXou

.@NPR stopped the coverage prematurely, frustratingly.  Just found it on another feed, and there he is talking about the litigation prospects. Anticipates suit in the 9th Circuit, draws analogy to Travel Ban litigation.
Section 2808 requires not just *any* national emergency declaration (whether the new one today or the existing int‚Äôl narcotics one), but specifically one that ‚Äúrequires the use of the armed forces.‚Äù That is the main point of litigation vulnerability.

My lengthy take on exactly what courts should be asking in such cases, before deferring:  https://t.co/o0mPHesPIS https://t.co/mEXD5JhEMp

@jakoppel @jacklgoldsmith @charlie_savage Certainly could be this.  "Legacy" is sometimes used to refer to "core" or "original" al Qaeda's lingering elements, as distinct from AQ franchises/splinters.
Important point about the Badawi strike.  I don't know anything about Badawi's status, alas. The "vitiation" of membership issue came up from time to time in various GTMO habeas cases.  No idea if DOD carried over any of that jurisprudence into the targeting/LOAC setting. https://t.co/gq7MT0MGvP
@kristinerudolph Literal!
@daltonator Thanks!
@Dangerclose001 @steve_vladeck @NSLpodcast We didn't talk about it, actually, but it's a great question.  I defer to @steve_vladeck on this, but possibilities include the House (another task for Doug Letter), impacted landowners, and those who will lose out on anticipated contracts due to the redirection.
In case what you needed is a bingo card to go along with tomorrow night's address, I've got you covered:		https://t.co/il5Ql2HM6N https://t.co/ZCav56qQdI
@justinmm2 @nycsouthpaw @steve_vladeck @NSLpodcast No doubt it will include such elements.
@Destroy_ALEC He had already indicated he is considering doing this, actually.  The novelty is just the possibility that he'll use an Oval Office speech to try to set the narrative supporting it.
@realchrisdolan Thanks for the heads-up!  Yep, the cheepfakes / shallowfakes cause much more havoc these days, and probably will continue to do so for some time to come.  Ugh.
Trump may use this speech to justify a "national emergency" declaration, in bid to activate 10 USC 2808 (authority to reprogram unobligated DOD construction funds when *militarily* necessary). @steve_vladeck &amp; I debunk this approach in today's @NSLpodcast: https://t.co/3GYs0n4K5t https://t.co/ZCav56qQdI

@hoffman_bruce @Levitt_Matt I chatted with @steve_vladeck about lack of domestic equivalent to FTO designation during @NSLpodcast yesterday.

My comments, at @lawfareblog, on news that the US citizen detainee from Doe v. Mattis has been released to Bahrain:		- the merits issue that never was resolved	- whether the episode is a precedent for similar detention	- what explains the passport cancellation. https://t.co/SwWgrDa9g9
@hunterschuler @NSLpodcast I do think he'd win *if* he litigated access to a passport to reenter the US.  I think this was a face-saving move to some extent.  Also bear in mind: he does risk a material-support prosecution if he were to sue to get that passport, win, and then enter the US.
@steve_vladeck @marty_lederman Correct - there was a long stretch in which the merits were contested. Though, in fairness, everyone acted like it was ok to suspend the merits issue while they litigated the attempted transfer to KSA.
@steve_vladeck @marty_lederman I‚Äôm halfway between you two. Once it got to the point where they were negotiating transfer, then I‚Äôm with Marty. But for a long while there it was a real detention fight yet the court moved very, very slowly.
The saga of Doe v. Mattis takes a long-awaited twist: he has been released to Bahrain. Expect dismissal of his habeas petition (not to mention a final review of it all on @NSLpodcast).		One element of the compromise: he kept his citizenship, yet his passport was canceled. https://t.co/uq9hP7Sqad

@kentborg @NSLpodcast @steve_vladeck Correct as a general proposition, though to put it mildly there are many nuances to this issue.
@kentborg @NSLpodcast @steve_vladeck The plurality implicitly accepted claim that detention of combatants under laws of war includes not just POW-eligibles but also some others who don‚Äôt qualify for privilege. No actual discussion of that distinction, yet it‚Äôs a necessary implication. Yes, akin to spies/saboteurs.

@HoltMLackey @steve_vladeck @jacklgoldsmith My initial reaction: with attorney-client privilege a translator is in shoes of principal for whom he/she translated.  If the principal has privilege, so too the translator (&amp; it's the principal's privilege to assert). So whatever privilege POTUS has would apply by extension.
@CosFot Even with an extradition treaty, no state (Russia, us, or anyone else) would extradite their own officials for conducting covert action and espionage overseas.  Only if one of them were to travel abroad to the wrong place would they potentially end up here.

@LemonSlayerUS @USAfricaCommand Yep, it raised the associated-forces question about the time, though if I recall correctly there was language that muddied the water as between a membership-based-link-to-AUMF theory vs an individual-link-to-AUMF.  This one seems the former.

@becingber @LemonSlayerUS @ACLU @steve_vladeck @charlie_savage It does seem that, on this view, USG could drop him off in Riyadh tomorrow, so long as there‚Äôs no custody awaiting.
Surprised @aclu doesn‚Äôt also argue that, safety aside, the Valentine rule should extend to involuntary cross-border *release* just as it does to involuntary cross-border custodial transfer. Would they not object to US sending him back to, say, KSA if on non-custodial basis? 3/3
The safe-release rule is not really in doubt. Issue is whether court can and will dispute govt‚Äôs assertion that this release would be safe enough‚Äîin short, a key predicate issue is how much deference govt gets on that mixed factual/policy predictive judgment. 2/3...

@Krhawkins5 @steve_vladeck That‚Äôs my second point: it‚Äôs involuntary movement across border, whether someone awaits to take custody on the other side or not. Perhaps Valentine should still apply.
2 issues here:		- is it a constructive transfer to the Syrian government (hard evidentiary issue, but easy doctrine if so)	- or is it genuine release, but with involuntary cross-border element (easy to establish factually, but new terrain doctrinally; probably Valentine extends?) https://t.co/2krmV1fird
@Krhawkins5 @steve_vladeck To me, two issues here:	- is it a constructive transfer to the Syrian government (hard evidentiary issue, but easy doctrine if so)	- or is it genuine release, but with involuntary cross-border element (conceded factually, but new terrain doctrinally; probably Valentine extends).
Extraordinary, yet not entirely unexpected (I had anticipated an in-Iraq release option, though not a back-to-Syria option). No doubt ACLU will challenge it. @steve_vladeck and I will be commenting on @NSLpodcast as it develops. https://t.co/ZraVo2u6lP

@LemonSlayerUS @qjurecic US ends up on same place then, I think: they try to win the habeas merits and, if they do, they hold him. Bad outcome for him compared to transfer I would think.
@marty_lederman @steve_vladeck @LemonSlayerUS @just_security @lawfareblog @ACLU Could be. If there‚Äôs a big redacted section, that would likely account for it.
@marty_lederman @steve_vladeck @LemonSlayerUS @just_security @lawfareblog @ACLU Unclear.  My impression, though, is that there was some sort of non-prosecutorial custody agreement.  Most likely the so-called rehab program KSA has.
@LemonSlayerUS @steve_vladeck @marty_lederman @just_security @lawfareblog @ACLU @charlie_savage I'm mildly surprised (a 6?).  I would not be surprised if gvt seeks en banc, or just goes for cert.  Now they've got an adverse ruling on this issue, so they might feel obliged to try and undue it (tho obviously this could just produce a worse outcome from their own perspective).
@marty_lederman @steve_vladeck @just_security @lawfareblog I suspect the latter Q will play a big role in the analysis. Of course, Doe didn't just go on vacation, but to a war zone in which the United States was engaged in conflict at the time (and here he's a citizen of the state to which he'd be sent).
@marty_lederman @steve_vladeck @just_security @lawfareblog Standing by!
The question I'll be looking at most closely:	Does the majority base this on the notion that US must first prove Doe is a combatant (thus conflating the merits issue with the Valentine issue), or is it instead simply a judgment that Valentine rather than Munaf applies? https://t.co/Bc7ZXCQH9g

POTUS at SOTU: interestingly, does NOT say anything about interrogation, though he seemed for a moment to be heading that way.
POTUS at SOTU: vague promise to bring new detainees to GTMO.
POTUS at SOTU: now criticizing release of captured terrorists, giving example of al-Baghdadi (who was among the hundred thousand plus once held in Iraq).
POTUS at SOTU: broad conflation of all "terrorists" with "unlawful enemy combatants." Does that mean a policy change? Probably not, but who knows. https://t.co/xqQtcX2kWa
About the new #GTMO EO:		If it merely says (i) GTMO stays open, (ii) SecDef shall study the issue, &amp; (iii) door is open to bring new detainees there... well, nothing surprising about that.

To sum up: these are all good reasons why the court was smart not to predetermine the transfer issue, and instead to just require advance notification so the particular circumstances can be considered.  Still, the merits discussion does seem much too abrupt.  /END
Those two considerations might not be enough to bring this situation outside of Valentine, but it requires discussion in my view (including discussion of what happens if he wins his habeas case and the court orders release; would he have to be brought to the United States?).
Additionally, the court does not address the fact that Doe already was outside the US (and indeed, likely has been outside the US since childhood) when captured on a foreign battlefield.  This too surely matters.
This seems insufficient to me for two reasons.  First, the court doesn't address possibility that transfer will be to Saudi Arabia--which not only is Doe's other country of citizenship, but also is a place where he likely has vastly greater practical ties. Surely that matters.
Third, note that Judge Chutkan's discussion of the likely outcome on the merits includes her views on the Valentine/Munaf issue.  She makes clear she views Valentine as the across-the-board rule, and reads Munaf as a narrow exception limited to its facts.
Second, in theory the government could seek an interlocutory appeal on this issue since it is injunctive.  I think it would be silly to do so.  Remember, the court has not yet actually banned any proposed transfer.
Shorter version: the court needs factual clarity about what the government's transfer plan might be before it can really say whether the Valentine rule--or, instead, an extension of the Munaf exception to that rule--applies.
First, I agree with this outcome for the reasons explained in more detail earlier today in this @lawfareblog post: https://t.co/UOqUEf8nUj

But Val. *might* still be distinguished bc Doe is not in US territory, and (if goal is transfer to KSA) he is citizen of receiving state. 		If not: query if LOAC provide requisite aff. auth.

Q4 continued: 		I haven't yet looked closely yet so I'm unsure if a distinction will fly. My off-cuff reaction is that the same result likely will apply here as well. 8/9
Q4: Can @kaspersky avoid that last bit by distinguishing DHS's statutory authority from the State Department FTO designation system? That is, can it show less/no Congressional approval for ex parte classified evidence in DHS context?  7/9
"the classified information [can] be presented in camera and ex parte to the court under the statute. This is within the privilege and prerogative of the executive, and we do not intend to compel a breach in the security which that branch is charged to protect."  6/9
Q3: Does the impacted entity get to see *all* the gov't's evidence, once it gets chance to challenge (before or after the designation)? Yes as to *unclassified* material, but no as to the *classified* stuff.  Here's the quote...	5/9
Q2: Does due process always require *advance* notice of the adverse action? Court said no, not always.  But the case for providing no advance notice must actually be explained in the particular instance; can't just deny advance notice on general principle.  4/9
Key takeaways from that precedent include:		Q1: Can foreign entities invoke the 5th Amendment in the first place? Yes, if they have sufficient US presence. DC Circuit concluded MEK/PMOI had enough ties. @kaspersky will certainly satisfy this inquiry. 3/9
Similar issue arose when certain Iranian groups challenged State Dep't designations as Foreign Terrorist Organizations. They too made due process arguments based on lack of notice/chance to rebut.  Here's the key ruling from DC Circuit (Sentelle): 	https://t.co/fSKgtXc2Fc 2/9
Mini-thread on @kaspersky lawsuit alleging DHS denied due process when it ordered removal of Kaspersky products from US govt systems w/out advance notice and opportunity to respond. There is an interesting precedent... 1/9 https://t.co/7TKgqvaeGU

@becingber @steve_vladeck @LemonSlayerUS @charlie_savage @tcwittes Agree, the obstacle shouldn't be habeas consequences. And shouldn't be hard to get diplomatic assurances. And this admin won't be skeptical on assurances.  I think they'd just genuinely prefer to prosecute if possible, or want a citizenship waiver.
@NC_CyberLaw @steve_vladeck @LemonSlayerUS @charlie_savage @tcwittes Could be!
@tcwittes @steve_vladeck @LemonSlayerUS @charlie_savage Sadly, stuff like this is page B13 material these days...
@steve_vladeck @LemonSlayerUS @charlie_savage @tcwittes Exactly.  Easy to imagine that someone decided to solve the puzzle by copying that model to some extent.  Also sounds like something current AG would like.
@LemonSlayerUS @steve_vladeck @charlie_savage @tcwittes Related idea: they are trying to convince the guy to sign a waiver of citizenship as part of a deal to move him to Saudi Arabia.
@KatieBoWill Great work getting that detail.
3. Article suggests the admin may feel reluctant to transfer to Saudis bc of general posture against *GTMO* transfers. But why view it that way? We have not kept a single other IS detainee caught in theater...transferred 'em all to Iraq w/out quibbling. 		- end
2. If diplomatic negotiations with Saudis are underway and genuinely likely to result in transfer soon, it is surprising gov't has not cited this as grounds to delay habeas review (as fall-back position).  *Are* such negotiation underway?
Important scoop.  Short thread on implications:		1. Gov't is in less of a pickle than I thought, for transfer *should* be an option here (even if prosecution not feasible and mil det uncertain to survive habeas review). https://t.co/82Vwwce5ma

This article makes it clearer: Judge Chutkan likely to rule against gov't on threshold issue in ACLU v. Mattis.  Again, that's the right result.  Gov't may well win on the merits in the end, but should not be able to forestall review like this. https://t.co/tjNa00RuHm
I hope judge doesn't fixate on idea that he might have worked through @ICRC to express interest in pursuing habeas relief.  Not their job. Even assuming they would pass such a message to family, why assume (i) he'd know about habeas or (ii) family would care to help him? https://t.co/3LLjebKskr
