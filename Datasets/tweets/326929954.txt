RT @arielleelliott: So exciting to see @SpeakerPelosi at the Women’s Congressional Policy Institute #WCPIGala https://t.co/gIjNQqjin8
“Speaker Pelosi @SpeakerPelosi is in the Women’s Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls and her Speaker’s gavel is displayed at the Smithsonian. But let’s be clear. She has only just begun.” @RepLawrence #WCPIGala
"Speaker Pelosi has been a champion for women and girls across this country. She has worked tirelessly for us. The economic security of women and their families is her top priority. She has led efforts for equal pay and affordable health care.” @RepLawrence #WCPIGala
“Now to introduce the Speaker of the House of Representatives, @SpeakerPelosi. Not only is she the first woman to lead a party in the House or Senate, she’s also—the first woman ever to serve as Speaker of the House, and now to serve again as Speaker." @RepLawrence #WCPIGala
“We will continue the Caucus’ work to address the unique needs of women service members and veterans. And we will work to expand opportunities for women and girls in STEAM: science, technology, engineering, the arts, and math.” @RepDLesko #WCPIGala
“We will continue to focus on combatting sex trafficking and violence against women and girls, on campuses, or in the military. Caregiving, elder care, and health issues specific to older women, as well as opioid misuse and mental health, will be priorities.” @RepDLesko #WCPIGala
“At a time when partisan tensions can run high in Washington, the members of the Women’s Caucus see each other as friends and sisters, united in our goal of helping to advance women and girls.” @RepDLesko #WCPIGala
“A key priority will be addressing the high rate of maternal mortality. Looking for ways to expand women’s financial security, including improving economic self-sufficiency, retirement security, &amp; promoting family friendly workplaces is also our priority.” @RepLawrence #WCPIGala
“One of our top priorities for this Congress will be to strengthen our relationships within the Caucus and with women Members of Parliament globally. The Women’s Caucus is a living example that bipartisan cooperation is possible.” @RepLawrence #WCPIGala
“I am so pleased to be co-chairing the Women’s Caucus with @RepDLesko. What makes the Women’s Caucus unique is that we truly are a bipartisan group.” @RepLawrence #WCPIGala
“Before we invite the Women’s Caucus members on stage, I wanted to thank the @WCPInst for the wonderful work they do. The Women’s Congressional Policy Institute is a tremendous resource to me and so many of the women members in the room tonight.” @RepLawrence #WCPIGala
“Margaret Heckler, Marilyn Lloyd, and Louise Slaughter are missed, but their legacies live on.”@RepDLesko #WCPIGala

The first woman elected to Congress from Massachusetts, Ambassador Margaret Heckler represented suburban Boston in Congress from 1967-1982. She was a co-founder and first Republican co-chair of the Congressional Caucus for Women’s Issues. #WCPIGala
“Before moving to the program, we would like to take a moment to remember three women Members who we lost since our last gala: former Ambassador and Congresswoman Margaret Heckler, Congresswoman Marilyn Lloyd, and Congresswoman Louise Slaughter.” @RepDLesko #WCPIGala

.@RepLoisCapps says when she was young, women vowed to leave the world better for their daughters.  #wpihealth
Champion for women's health, Representative Lois Capps @RepLoisCapps addresses the audience.  #wpihealth

Debbie Chatman Bryant wants an environment that allows the professionals to do the work they do. #wpihealth
Nora D. Volkow, MD says, we need more knowledge, but priority to implement the evidence-based interventions we already have. #wpihealth
Her program decreased # of patients who do not return for care following abnormal mammogram from 11% in 2009 to &lt; 5% since '10. #wpihealth
Positive outcomes are possible, says Debbie Chatman Bryant. #wpihealth
Working class "Maria" described hearing her diagnosis as a feeling like "death sentence."   #wpihealth
Navigators helped a frightened “Maria” though complex health system – paperwork, scheduling, transportation, &amp; communication.  #wpihealth
Bryant describes doctors who designate patients as non-compliant without understanding circumstances. #wpihealth
Bryant believes that when we build a culture of health, positive outcomes are within reach. #wpihealth
“Mary” was given food, shelter, and had successful surgery. Mary continues her recovery and keeps in touch w Bryant's group. #wpihealth
Ex: “Mary” homeless w advanced breast cancer managing her own illness &amp; adult son w mental illness &amp; learning disabilities. #wpihealth
Problems w Medicaid delayed care and after her baby was born, "Melissa" passed away.  #wpihealth
Ex: 35 yo, uninsured African American woman, "Melissa," pregnant with her 5th child when diagnosed w breast cancer.  #wpihealth
The desired outcome is to provide services along the continuum: prevention, to early detection, through diagnosis &amp; treatment. #wpihealth
Bryant provides cancer screening &amp; prevention service - ensures clients receive appropriate diagnostic and treatment care.  #wpihealth
Bryant also leads education &amp; awareness efforts to lower risk of chronic disease. #wpihealth
Bryant directs a mobile screening van addressing cancer disparities among racially diverse &amp; underserved populations.  #wpihealth
Poor, uneducated patients didn't understand their diseases or prevention; how to navigate the complex healthcare maze. #wpihealth
At her community hospital, Byrant cared for patients who came back again and again for the same health issues. #wpihealth
Bryant saw women putting their own health on the back burner - succumbing to preventable and manageable diseases as a result. #wpihealth
Bryant grew up in rural SC. She saw the daily struggles women faced raising children, paying bills, and caring for relatives  #wpihealth

Representative @DorisMatsui tells the story of Carol who cared for her husband w Alzheimer's disease - the toll this took.  #wpihealth
Dr Volkow passionately calls for funding more research to understand pain in women and how to treat more effectively.  #wpihealth
Women suffer more pain than men (migraine, back, neck, or hip pain). Their reports of pain more likely to be dismissed. #wpihealth
Women more likely to have chronic pain, be prescribed Rx painkillers, be given higher doses, use for longer time than men #wpihealth
Dr. Nora Volkow suggests Rx opioid deaths in women are caused by increased pain conditions in women. #wpihealth
Rx opioid overdose deaths greatest among women 35-55 years, 2010 (CDC) @NIDAnews #wpihealth
Drug overdoses in US have more than tripled since '90. Increase 5x greater for women. Causes 100 deaths per day. (CDC) #wpihealth

Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death in the U.S. #wpihealth
Higher rates of drug use seen in men. Men are more likely to be exposed to drugs starting at adolescence.  #wpihealth
Because legal drugs (prescriptions) are more available and statistically more people consume them and have adverse effects.  #wpihealth

.@linda_rosenberg The idea that stigma prevents people from getting service isn't true. People don't know where to get services. #wpihealth
.@JacksonLeeTX18 how do you deal with bullying? You deal with it in best practices. #wpihealth #mentalhealth
.@JacksonLeeTX18 18-25 is a very vibrant, very vital, and a challenging time for young people. #wpihealth #mentalhealth
.@JacksonLeeTX18 we have always been a step behind on resources &amp; prioritization for all people in need of mental health services #wpihealth
.@linda_rosenberg we need to expand capacity for the treatment of mental illness. #wpihealth #mentalhealth
.@linda_rosenberg We are unable to intervene either right before or right after the first episode for many people. #mentalhealth #wpihealth
.@linda_rosenberg Treatment for chronic psychiatric disorders are as effective as treatment for physical disorders. #wpihealth #MentalHealth
.@linda_rosenberg of @nationalcouncil: Serious mental illness drives you into poverty. #wpihealth #mentalhealth

Dr. Huang...what are the early warning signs and what are the early interventions? #mentalhealth #wpihealth
Dr. Huang half of all life-time cases of mental illnesses start at age 14. #wpihealth #mentalhealth
Dr. Huang @samhsagov people rally around those w/physical ailments; when someone comes home from psychiatric care, all is quiet. #wpihealth
.@DorisMatsui Those living with mental illness are more likely to be the victims of crimes than the perpetrators. #wpihealth
.@DorisMatsui In cases when individuals can get help, it is literally a lifesaving experience.  #wpihealth #mentalhealth
.@DorisMatsui Mental illness impacts all of us. #wpihealth #mentalhealth
.@DorisMatsui All too often we differentiate between mental and physical health, as if the brain were not part of the body.  #wpihealth
.@DorisMatsui Women truly stand out as advocates of this issue. #mentalhealth   #WPIhealth
.@davidccolby Severe mental illness affects more adolescents and young people than any other illness. #WPIHealth
.@davidccolby There is almost no healthcare or public health initiative that has not been touched by @RWJF_PubHealth.  #wpihealth
@RepLoisCapps When we invest in #MentalHealth , we make our communities stronger, safer, and better places to live. #wpihealth

Thanks for joining us for the #wpihealth briefing on @CHRankings today. Video will be on our website shortly.
Cofsky: We're seeing a real breadth of those who are involved in the conversation beyond public health. #wpihealth @CHRankings
One way we track progress is media coverage. Recently we have seen stories about what communities are doing in response to data. #wpihealth
Grinnell: we're working to increase school breakfast participation by 50%. #wpihealth

Grinnell: Women are far more likely to live in poverty than men are. When you live in poverty, your health outcomes=not as good. #wpihealth
Sue Grinnell of @WA_DeptofHealth notes that the state has embraced the idea that past and present behaviors impact health. #wpihealth
@HerreraBeutler This report gives us a good road map &amp; starting point to improve the health &amp; well-being of the people you serve. #wpihealth
.@HerreraBeutler our health is often determined by the area that we live in, work in, go to school in than the doctors we see. #wpihealth

Catlin: There are 25 different measures of key important health factors. #wpihealth @CHRankings
Catlin: rankings are a way of taking a whole lot of complex data and simplifying it.  They can be a call to action. #wpihealth
Catlin: Why do we rank? Rankings are everywhere! You name it, we rank it. #wpihealth
Dr. Bridget Catlin: Just like politics are local, health is local too. #wpihealth

The @CHRankings can bring leaders together for a conversation; as framework for taking action. #wpihealth #womenshealth
Policymakers can use the data as a call to action around public health. #wpihealth @CHRankings
Not just traditional health leaders looking at the data; business leaders, planners, community leaders value healthy community. #wpihealth
RT @IVLPGradSchool: "Increasingly, our zip code is more important than our genetic code in our health." @WomensPolicyInc #wpihealth
.@CHRankings have sparked a conversation about what is driving health. #wpihealth
If we want to change health, we need to change from a patient by patient approach to a neighborhood by neighborhood approach. #wpihealth
.@RWJF_PubHealth Cofsky: we have seen the conversation shift to one that is about health and prevention. #wpihealth #womenshealth
