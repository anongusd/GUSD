@3DTruth @AnaKasparian ONCE AGAIN, I challenge you to a fact-based discussion. In fact, Ana's video was full of twisting and bending of facts in order to provide air cover for Cenk.
@vicgerami @AnaKasparian @Playboy @TheYoungTurks @Asbarez @ArmenianWeekly @thebluntpost @QueerFrontierV https://t.co/GAbQ9qXcdr
@mark777day @AnaKasparian @TheYoungTurks More propaganda and air cover for genocide denier Cenk.		https://t.co/GAbQ9qXcdr https://t.co/lET0dTOcAu
@Cynon44 @AnaKasparian @Playboy @YouTube As Cenk and Ana say (sorry, maybe it was Goebbels), "repeat a lie often enough and it becomes the truth" https://t.co/GAbQ9qXcdr https://t.co/cO4HganeMb
@hopeklein @YouTube @AnaKasparian Except that it is perfect example of the TYT's intellectual dishonesty on the issue: https://t.co/GAbQ9qXcdr https://t.co/3SxxfYiAO3
@3DTruth @Playboy @arttavana @AnaKasparian Use your brain and let's have a fact-based discussion on this issue, if you can. 		Otherwise, you are just a left-wing analogue to the Trumpism that you complain about so much: https://t.co/GAbQ9qXcdr
@sadydoyle @arttavana Whatever his ideology, the article solid. It would be a great service to progressives if folks like you were more rational and fact-based. Otherwise, you're contributing not only to intellectual deficit but also to genocide denial.		https://t.co/GAbQ9qXcdr
@ThomasKearins @Playboy @InsaneChampWres @MaeYoungClassic @missviper91 @arttavana Thank you if you indeed facilitated this @ThomasKearins		https://t.co/GAbQ9qXcdr
@BruiserBrown_ @AnaKasparian @Playboy @arttavana @cenkuygur @rybrown Unfortunately, her video is full of deliberate errors, again covering up for genocide denier Cenk. https://t.co/GAbQ9qXcdr
@AtomicElbow @AnaKasparian @arttavana @Playboy It took Ana nearly a decade to get the courage to talk about the issue. And she is till providing air cover to genocide denier Cenk Uygur. 		https://t.co/GAbQ9qXcdr
Do you not see any problems with Cenk being out of the picture completely? Why does Ana feel necessary to take so much heat for him?  https://t.co/GAbQ9qXcdr https://t.co/hImJAixaCH
@XI_node @arttavana @AnaKasparian @NotDevonTracey Here is a well thought-out video with a less misogynistic title: https://t.co/GAbQ9qXcdr
@playingunclean @Playboy @arttavana Art Tavana's column was actually VERY BRAVE and intellectually honest, in the face of Ana's continuous attempts to twist this issue into sexism or attacking a powerful woman. https://t.co/GAbQ9qXcdr
@HovikYerevan @mrShaneMichael @AnaKasparian @nikk_faith @Playboy @arttavana @cenkuygur https://t.co/GAbQ9qXcdr
@cenkuygur Enough hiding behind Ana's skirt!!!! Show your true colors and explain your true position on the Armenian Genocide. DO NOT TIP TOE around the issue.
