@JeremyChesser3 @realDonaldTrump Good idea but I don‚Äôt think Democrat leadership would go for that. Most of the Reps on the left side of the aisle never wanted to restrict Obama‚Äôs overreach, and they still don‚Äôt want to rein in the executive branch.  For most (but not all), this is only about President Trump.
There is a crisis at our border, but it‚Äôs not an emergency when Congress doesn‚Äôt spend money how the President wants. The President‚Äôs constitutional remedy is to veto spending bills that aren‚Äôt suitable to him, yet he has chosen to sign many bills that did not fund the wall.
The appropriations process belongs within Congress according to the Constitution. To the extent that Congress has in the past relinquished some of that authority broadly, it has done so recklessly.
In order to be consistent in preserving the constitutional structure of our Republic, I will be voting for the resolution to prevent the President from using a national emergency declaration to re-appropriate money for the wall.
I support President Trump and I support the wall. In fact I voted to fund the wall for the full amount requested by @realDonaldTrump. I also called out President Obama when he tried to use his pen and phone to sidestep Congress on immigration, war, healthcare, and gun control.

@ChuziChips We don‚Äôt have to imagine.  The solar tariffs add about 10 cents to the $2.50/ watt installed price of a setup with Chinese panels. (Not much). And all the panels in this picture were produced domestically (made in USA).
@Michele7216 @canderson93 The picture in the OP is my setup, making power today, yet I would never put my name to the ridiculous GND.
@eastriverrunner Mine does, but it‚Äôs not cheap and sometimes we have to live without air conditioning in the summer and bundle up inside in the winter.  I just don‚Äôt think these legislators have much of a clue about what they‚Äôre asking for, because they don‚Äôt even live it themselves.
@scottspjut Nice, I‚Äôm waiting to hear why those who make $174,000 per year, and have signed their names to the #GND, would be using coal and natural gas to power their homes when solar and wind solutions have been commercially available for a decade.
@TerraMarQue @FreedomWorks I would have YOU do what YOU think YOU should do and what YOU can afford to do, not what a bunch of hypocrites would force you to do.  Btw, those are my solar panels in the picture.  Took that picture today.

@cumberickman If I had a natural gas resource in my backyard, I‚Äôd frack that. The reality is everyone with a roof or yard has solar resource, yet only a few use it.  Have to ask why that is.
@CindiCooper1 I haven‚Äôt looked at the wind resource maps recently but I‚Äôd wager that solar is cheaper than wind in almost all of Eastern Ky.  Natural gas and coal have them both beat until a practical battery or other type of energy storage is available.

(5/5) In the context of everything that was going on (which the media hasn‚Äôt shown) the parents and mentors of these boys should be proud, not ashamed, of their kids‚Äô behavior. It is my honor to represent them.
(4/5) In the face of racist and homosexual slurs, the young boys refused to reciprocate or disrespect anyone. Even when taunted by homophobic bigots, which was obviously bewildering to them, they insulted no one.
(3/5) I‚Äôve now watched over an hour of other videos from 4 different cameras of the incident in front of the Lincoln Memorial. I urge everyone to watch the other videos before passing judgement. Would you have remained that composed at that age under those circumstances?
(2/5) The honorable and tolerant students of Covington Catholic School came to DC to advocate for the unborn and to learn about our nation‚Äôs Capitol. What they got was a brutal lesson in the unjust court of public opinion and social media mobs.
(1/5) I was uncomfortable when I saw the video &amp; description that first went viral, so I understand the initial reactions to the CovCath video. I chose to wait for more facts before responding because the narrative did not match what I know to be the character of these students.

You just imagined some form of government that resembles neither a republic nor a democracy. What do you call this form of government? https://t.co/UOVEJ09ztF
@Paw___Paw I think the Senate passed it by unanimous consent, which means they didn‚Äôt even vote on it but it‚Äôs headed to the President‚Äôs desk.
@vardai Forever?		If you meant to say that no one should have to come to work if they are not paid I would agree.
@KYCOLGREGL They shouldn‚Äôt be working if they‚Äôre not paid.  And if that were the case (ATC, TSA, etc not working), the Dems would negotiate with Trump and this shutdown would be over in 24 hours.
@kurtes25 S.24
@WilliamKColeman Don‚Äôt shoot the messenger, but what you‚Äôre asking for is a repeal of the 27th amendment to the Constitution.
@ChelleTweets I agree. No one should have to work without pay, which is why they shouldn‚Äôt be forced to come to work unless there‚Äôs a congressional appropriation for their pay.
If our country is doomed to bankruptcy, it‚Äôs because 2/3s of government spending is deemed MANDATORY, which means it happens whether Congress votes for it or not. Yesterday, 411 members of Congress permanently moved the entire federal payroll from discretionary to mandatory. SAD!
@JeremyRFLA @SolusIgnis I agree.  If shutdowns were true shutdowns (TSA and Air traffic controllers didn‚Äôt come to work), they‚Äôd be resolved within an hour, or likely never happen. There‚Äôs a healthy discussion on the House floor about how government can force people to come to work without paying them!?
@JeremyRFLA @SolusIgnis Shutdowns will still occur &amp; paychecks will be delayed &amp; many services will cease. The obligation to eventually pay everyone at the end of the shutdown regardless of whether they worked will however be on autopilot forever. So I forecast more prevalent, longer, milder?, shutdowns
RT @chiproytx: This is exactly right. https://t.co/g081jO8gYE
@courierjournal Misleading title written by editors who don‚Äôt care about the truth or can‚Äôt understand legislation.
@SolusIgnis That‚Äôs a thoughtful question. There‚Äôs no promise of employment beyond the period of time for which Congress has appropriated money (a fiscal year). It could be changed, but it seems unwise to allow one Congress to bind the next Congress with employment contracts.
When you pass a law to pay ALL FUTURE government salaries regardless of whether the government is funded or not, then you‚Äôve effectively moved the entire government payroll from discretionary to non-discretionary spending. Today‚Äôs bill was fundamentally flawed and dangerous.
@Ksdsc6 If we had won this vote, there would have immediately been another vote on a more responsible bill that guarantees back pay for federal workers in the current shutdown.
He‚Äôs right.  This bill makes it MORE likely that we will have MORE shutdowns.  That‚Äôs why I voted No. https://t.co/BQhgAZD4Jm

@4est_libertate @freedomfirstAK Sorry: scale is 24 hours left to right in these images and one pixel is 5 minutes. So the period of oscillation is about 10 minutes, but that could vary based on size of clouds and wind speed. Roughly, the capacitor would have to be able to provide about 500 watts for 5 minutes.
@BarbaraMatheney https://t.co/bjKY1BBCbU
@charleseblack Not yet.  Maybe some day.
@Kolin_Quark @Ian56789 360 to 400 volts DC in the native Model S configuration.  That was one of the challenges with this project: re-wiring 16 modules into a 2s8p configuration to present 44 to 50 volts to the 48 volt inverters.
@ColYokan Just one Raspberry Pi, connected to one Arduino, connected to 16 tesla BMS boards native to the Tesla battery modules.
@KenJespersen 14kW of panels feeding 6 MPPT‚Äôers which are charging the battery at about 48 volts.
@topherhodes üëåü§ì
@Viss 3 days without recharging, assuming only light usage of the central heating/cooling provided by the heat pump.

Thank you @TwitchyTeam for covering this thread! https://t.co/DNB99RXCRj
@freedomfirstAK @4est_libertate I do think having a capacitor to keep the battery from dithering between charge and discharge could help prolong the battery life.  Here are a couple screen shots where I have highlighted where I think a capacitor could have helped: https://t.co/gk6lN7D2Yi
@RymonHernanigan It‚Äôs mostly 7,104 individual Panasonic ‚Äú18650‚Äù laptop batteries. We have the free market for cell phones, power tools, and laptops to thank for development of these batteries.
@4est_libertate I rewired the battery modules in an 8s2p configuration so the nominal voltage is about 47v instead of 375v.  You can touch it anywhere and live... just don‚Äôt have a bare metal wrench in your hands and touch the wrong places.
@MatedCzech unistrut FTW! https://t.co/kQbx3ZzuUy
@Spiritof1861 Thanks! 85kWhr. Would have loved to keep it in its original automotive configuration at 400 volts, but needed to wire these 8s2p to make the 48 volts that my inverters want to see.
@mlthigpen Got me beat by a bit!  My first compiler was Borland Turbo C in DOS on a 386.  Programming C is so much easier now with github and internet.
@jessehargis Yes, $350 on eBay, all day long.  These are $10k items new!  I can trip the whole shebang with the raspberry Pi if anything gets askew inside the battery modules.
@Neubian @jsquidstew @RebuildsRich Not sure how valuable it was to this project, but I have watched hours of his videos!  Love his spirit.
@rich_purtell The Water Furnace brand heat pumps have a ‚Äúsoft-start‚Äù feature that I had retrofitted to mine.  Not really necessary with this battery and 14.4kW of inverters, but helpful for the rare occasions when running directly from the backup generator while generator is charging batteries
@geezheeztall @dmartosko Kinda.  Except I built the storage equivalent of 6 powerwalls, at less than half the price, using a car that was totaled, and added a feature that‚Äôs fundamentally lacking from the factory powerwall... the ability to work without a connection to the grid.
@MFS314 https://t.co/p2X7EVjTx3
@MatthewAdamByrd I think it‚Äôs very neat and it could work at night when my panels don‚Äôt, but after doing the equations, it‚Äôs just not worth it here in Kentucky compared to adding more panels &amp; batteries or energy saving appliances.
@LibertyGorilla 4 Outback VFX3648 inverters wired series-parallel and 6 Outback MPPTs (5x60 amp and 1x80 amp).  Legacy stuff, 12 yrs old.
@RightGlockMom @dougstafford It‚Äôs a Raspberry Pi talking to an Arduino (using ASCII over serial) talking to tesla BMS boards (using CAN protocol). If you look real close, toward the back, there‚Äôs an automotive cigarette lighter plug thrown in there to convert the Arduino 12v source to 5v for the pi.  üò≠

@4est_libertate I‚Äôve been off the grid for 12 years, so I don‚Äôt have the wires or the meter to sell it back.
@4est_libertate 85kWhr storage, 14 kW panels ~&gt; 56kWhr/day avg yearly production in KY, 18kWhr/day base consumption (w/o heat pump). 2 heat pumps that can each consume 2kW @ 100% duty cycle. But it‚Äôs all about the peaks and valleys, and we burn wood in the winter in a 40kW gasifying boiler.

@tman1112000 Never.  We conserve before we run out, and when all else fails, a propane generator kicks on, but rarely.
@ZackJohnson777 C and C++ typically use the same compiler (C is a subset of C++).  I‚Äôd tinker with an interpreted language without all the syntax and memory declaration issues (BASIC or python), and then go on to C (if you want to do real-time controls type stuff).  But I am old fashioned.
@jsquidstew @jolmstead2k I invented a haptic (touch interface) for virtual reality that my wife and I used to start a company in our married student housing dorm at MIT.  (she graduated from MIT too)
@MrDrewHashtag Lol. good point! It was originally the OUTSIDE wall of my basement, so it was poured and coated in tar to waterproof it.  Then I built a masonry room next to the basement (for the batteries) and just painted over the tar.  The batteries and I don‚Äôt care what that wall looks like.
Everything in our house, including geothermal heat-pump and deep freezer (full of grass-fed beef ü•© we raised), is running on this rekt ModelS tesla battery right now.

@DeanFromNJ @scottspjut Your thread prompted me to clarify with another tweet.

Plants, including ones we eat and ones our animals eat, do better when CO2 levels increase and not as well when CO2 levels decrease.

Obama knew a bumpstock ban was executive overreach, but Trump is doing it. Trying to wrap my head around this. The current  administration was duped into this so Congress could avoid the whole discussion and pretend to support the 2nd Amdt. The WH needs better advisors.

@Jcanguy This school district didn‚Äôt vote to hire an armed guard. They voted to arm trained teachers.  Concealed carry is far more effective at deterring and stopping crime compared to one or two guards for a large facility.

@___a___v___s States are already allocated electors in the electoral college based on population. A state with 2x the pop. gets 2x the electors as the smaller state in the EC. Additionally every state gets 2 electors not based on pop.  Those 2 electors were inconsequential in Trump‚Äôs victory.
@king1799315886 Like != endorsement... except in the case of your last tweet.  queue Dos Equis meme please.
@tommyjensen I also posted in my reply to @QuentinConway.  Take the number of states won by Trump.  Multiply by two (that‚Äôs the ‚Äúoverrepresentation‚Äù factor). Subtract the result from his electoral total.  Do the same for Hillary (incl DC). Trump still has a higher electoral total.
@mikey_potatoes @QuentinConway @GOP Math is hard.
@kn_dn_40 @QuentinConway I think we misunderstand each other.  Most who complain about the electoral college criticize the fact that it assigns every state two additional electors, not based on population. Many of those believe, mistakenly, that this feature of the EC is responsible for Trump‚Äôs victory.
@QuentinConway Here‚Äôs the easiest way to do the math: take the number of states Trump won, multiply by 2 and subtract the result from his electoral college total.  Do the same thing for Clinton (ok to include DC).  Compare their electoral votes.  He still has more.
@NetworkJunkyz But the disparity between popular vote result and electoral college result is not due to the intentional protection (or some might say over representation) of small states prescribed by the Constitution.
@ErikRensberger But many do gripe about it and in the context of this last election specifically... leaving no doubt that they haven‚Äôt done the math, are acting tribally, and are just repeating what they‚Äôve heard (or misheard).
What if I told you that the disproportionate representation of smaller states designed into the electoral college had nothing to do with Trump‚Äôs victory and it‚Äôs mathematically provable?  I‚Äôm sure some would deny the fact, because after 2 years, they‚Äôve still not done the math.

@mattstringertx It‚Äôs one of the top 4 reasons I hear for term limits.  But what reason compels you to support term limits the most?
@Deb6246 I‚Äôd love to answer that question but I‚Äôm generally prohibited from using this twitter account to speak about my election activity.  I can safely say: ‚Äúaccording to the Constitution, every House seat is filled by a popular election every two years.‚Äù
@AEngelberth Now that hypothetical could work with two more constraints... no one with even a year of experience in DC and no state legislators can come to DC.  They practice all their bad habits in the State legislatures and perfect them in DC.
One argument for term limits is ‚Äúa member behaves better knowing it‚Äôs his/her last term.‚Äù		We had ~50 retirements this Congress.  Sift through the data and see if those members	(1) became great patriots, 	(2) stayed the same, or 	(3) got worse in their last term.  		Spoiler: 2&amp;3
@DamonEBurgess @stuntbrain One reason for so many new vacancies is retirements. Those retiring knew well in advance that it was their last term. Did retiring members perform better in their last term?  If so, I couldn‚Äôt see it... one yr we called repubs voting for debt limit increase the retirement caucus!
@thaimaishuu No.  Self imposed term limit pledges, in the absence of universally imposed term limits, are a gimmick at best and counterproductive at worst.
@Lynn_Rose1 @chasingandy .@SenFrankNiceley has a plan for countermanding the 17th. Each party controls its own primary.  The method of selecting primary candidates already varies by state and by party. Let the members of the State legislatures of each party choose their US Senate primary candidate.

@Popular_Voter My Audit the Fed bill passed the oversight committee this Congress.  Also, hundreds of acres of hemp were grown and harvested in Ky this year thanks to the hemp legislation that I was instrumental in getting on the 2013/2014 farm bill, and into law.
@chasingandy That‚Äôs the point of my original tweet... self imposed term limit pledges by candidates are a gimmick at best, and counterproductive at worst, for those constituents who really want term limits.
Regardless of how the elections turn out: On Jan 3, 2019 over half (218+) of the US House will have served 6 years or less.		This will be a great chance to test the theory that ‚Äúshort tenures = better congresspeople = better Congress.‚Äù
@chasingandy I am a cosponsor of the term limit bill but I haven‚Äôt self-term-limited, for the reasons noted above.  Also, I would say, people will be sorely disappointed at the problems that will persist even if term limits pass.  It‚Äôs just not a silver bullet.

@Christi196155 @Frank62310271 enemy=generalization		She wants to rally people in 435 congressional districts to pressure their congressmen until they vote according to the movement.  That‚Äôs her plan anyway.
@BozOzler Understanding that her sentence made sense is the beginning of understanding how to stop this, IMHO.
@yosemiteshane We should find our ears and listen to the socialists when they tell us how they plan to defeat us.
@Frank62310271 Yes indeed!  And she just explained how she plans to make moderate and conservative congressmen vote like leftists. When your enemies speak, it pays to listen, even if it‚Äôs hard to understand what they‚Äôre saying.
@ThurstonDana I thought she was fairly articulate in explaining her strategy.  The talking head didn‚Äôt understand her but he pretended to.
@BLugosch Instead of wasting all her breath on 534 colleagues, she‚Äôs going to use her position in Congress to lead an outside movement that will put pressure on her colleagues.
@brentmayberry @ricky_ole The DC GOP had a movement handed to them on a silver platter (it put them in the majority) but rather than foster it, they treated it as the enemy.  This woman wants to foster an outside movement (albeit anti-Constitution) instead of stifle it as a means of changing DC.
@yaakosine Instead of wasting all her breath on 534 colleagues, she‚Äôs going to use her position in Congress to lead an outside movement that will put pressure on her colleagues.
Laugh at her words if you makes you feel smarter, but ignore them at the peril of our country. I understood exactly what she said.  No GOP leader paid attention to the Tea Party movement that put them in power, and now we reap what their indifference to the people has sowed. https://t.co/TQukgT3QgW

@ToddLMay @BoilerUpFTW Granted, Syria is a good example of Congress dodging its responsibility. That was pre-ISIS though.  Post ISIS, Congress would have voted for war, but it happened anyway under various prior AUMF etc.  Afghanistan and Iraq are examples of Congress having no problem going to war.
@ToddLMay @BoilerUpFTW As long as it‚Äôs free to them, I fear my colleagues would be eager start wars too.

@BaberRaza1 Sorry, I will also try to answer your exact question: I believe Congressional rules prohibit us from having unlimited interns.  In any case, having 10 would be an undue distraction for the permanent employees and the interns would not get a quality experience.
@BaberRaza1 I think the experience and resume building for the interns is worth more than the salary, so I see no problem with paying them below minimum wage, or nothing at all. OTOH, I get the best interns when I offer pay, so I pay them.  The free market works.
Yet many congressional offices hire interns and pay them nothing.   The last review I read showed that Dems are less likely to pay interns than Repubs. https://t.co/znFWtrR301

@GarySamwich If you‚Äôre proposing to fight tariffs with tariffs, shouldn‚Äôt we have a broad based import tariff instead of letting DC pick the winners and losers?
@chimera_gothic1 Why not import and stockpile the steel at a lower price than we can produce it?  ie, if the Chinese are selling it below cost, buy it, stockpile it, and let them subsidize our military?  (just a hypothetical based on stockpiling.  I don‚Äôt think govt stockpiling is wise.)
@barris4congress I think the answer is no, but I‚Äôm open to the possibility of an alternate answer, and I‚Äôm willing to listen.		eg, perhaps we hope the Chinese will throttle steel production. But the Chinese have a billion ppl to feed, and many of those meals depend on the mills running full bore.
Can the following 2 things similtaneously be true?		(1) A 25% tariff on steel is necessary to buttress our domestic steel industry for national defense purposes.		(2) As soon as other countries axe their tariffs, we will axe our tariffs, including the 25% tariff on steel.

@S_PinkertonJr The President can‚Äôt be held accountable with any Congressional resolution, appropriation, or law, unless 218 of my colleagues are willing to hold the President accountable.  So the effort involves convincing my colleagues... who can only be convinced by an informed public.
For those who say POTUS can order strikes w/o Congress:		1) can he strike China/Russia/Britain under same authority?		2) can he bomb Assad‚Äôs living quarters?		3) is there a limit to size of weapon?  (MOAB? Nuke?)		4) can he send troops?		5) did Obama have same authority in Libya?

Did you know there were 2 votes on the Omnibus in the House?  One was to suspend the rule book in order to ram it through without amendment votes or time to read the bill.  That vote almost failed!

I think it's likely that the first 10 seconds of shots was from a machine gun, not a bump stock. Wait for facts before calling for new laws.
@tiffanyclay If you listen to the contiguous 10 minute video, most of the time was spent not shooting.

Obamacare repeal and tax reform can't happen in 9 months, but now some GOP signaling they're ready to immediately work on gun control?
@well_control Correct.  But neither the president nor the ATF can countermand existing federal law passed by congress.
Congress asking the ATF (exec branch) to invent new law invites mischief beyond the gun-control realm and betrays our system of government

@RyanArnstein Hijackers were Saudi, not Afghan and they don't need Afghanistan to carry out terrorism.  Current control of Afghanistan involves Taliban.
