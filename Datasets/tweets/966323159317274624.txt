Senator Wyden (D-OR) is ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee. He responds to question on Trumps proposed tariffs with “I will have more to say when I think there is a trade policy to last more than 48 hours.”
Schumer responds to gun question- mentions the March Against Gun Violence happening on March 24th. The government is currently only funded until the 23rd and will likely shut down. It is uncertain what action the March will lead to for lawmakers if the government is not open.
Senator Baldwin (D-WI) Whyden (D-OR) stand behind Schumer (D-NY) on tariffs, gun law action, and gun regulation. On tariffs, he says it “is not targeted”. This is similar to Speaker Ryan’s “surgical” comments earlier today. https://t.co/yZpmkMauRh
