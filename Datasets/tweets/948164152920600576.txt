@_Grackon_ @TamashiiHiroka Honestly, Gen 5 didn't add much, but the few tweaks over Gen 4 (which do keep in mind is still a really good game) WHILE creating a new (and more original) story make it my personal favorite. (And I brace for impact)
@_Grackon_ @TamashiiHiroka I simply said it doesn't make many major advancements, and feels (to some extent) a reskin of Gen6 w/a few extras. Gen2 added color, eggs, shinies, and a female player character. Gen3 added abilities, weather, contests, multi battles, and wireless connection (with adapter).
@TamashiiHiroka (cont.) Sure, adding an option of being female is fine, but people EXPECTED the hop to color for the most part. I guess eggs are fine, and it introduced shinies, but the egg and shiny systems are so much better in later games.
@TamashiiHiroka (cont.) even then, Alolan forms are unlikely to make more appearances, and otherwise, it's basically Gen 6 with a quirky online system	--My main point is that it's not really a matter of Gen 2 being the WORST, but more my least favorite.
@TamashiiHiroka -Gen 6 is kinda hand-holding, but makes up for it with updating bugs, being so open world, and having an amazing online system (GTS, Battle Spot)	-Gen 7 is my second least favorite, as it doesn't take many major advancements for the series, aside from Z-moves and kahunas
@TamashiiHiroka -Gen 1 has too much of a nostalgic connection	-Gen 3 has too good a soundtrack and level progression	-Gen 4 has the best soundtrack and has the best Pokemon overall	-Gen 5 has bad designs, but aside from that it's the best gen (gyms, type variety, story, freedom)
