Listen to people who have what you want.
We all have problems.	Shut up and solve them.
I am old school.	I still believe in respect.
Confidence is contagious.	Catch it. Spread it.
Reading is by far the most successful pursuit of happiness.
Your future depends on what you do today.
It's not what you do, It's how you do it.
Don't tell people your plans.	Show them your results.
Live a life that makes you happy.

Someday I'm gonna make my dreams come true.
Invest in yourself first, 	Expect nothing from no one, and be willing to work for everything.
Be willing to walk alone.	Many who started with you won't finish with you.
Chase your dreams not your competition.
You can do anything.
Invest in yourself,	It pays the best interest.
Loyalty is rare.	If you find it.	Keep it.
Stay on your grind.
Don't waste your energy on things you can't control.
Only the weak give up.
Surround yourself with friends that force you to level up.
There are no traffic jams along the extra mile.
The world needs big thinkers.
An open mind will open new doors.
Rich people act broke,	Broke people act rich.
In order to succeed	We must first believe that we can.
Do it for the people	Who want to see you fail.
We always want	What we don't have.
If you know you can do better,	You have a responsibility to yourself to do it.
Say yes to new opportunities.
If you don't apply your ideas,They are just sh*t.
You think making money is hard?	Try being broke.
Everyone is afraid of failure.	I'm afraid of not trying.
If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.
Time is limited.
It's never too late to change your life for the better.
https://t.co/P5DSCbnYyv
Showing off is the fool's idea of glory.
Most times, Regrets are things we didn't do, not those we did.
All the knowledge in the world is useless without action.
The question isn't who is going to let me, It's who's going to stop me.
Happy thoughts, 	Happy life.
Keep up or get left behind.
What is not started today is never finished tomorrow.
They said It's not possible.	That's why They're still broke.
The biggest lie you tell yourself : "But I don't have enough time..."
You are always one decision away from a totally different life.
A 'Job' won't make you rich.
Risk is the price you pay for opportunity.
Trust yourself.
Good people still exist.
Quality over quantity.
The most valuable thing you can make is a mistake. You can't learn anything from being perfect.
You are never a loser until you quit trying.
The beautiful thing about learning is nobody can take it away from you.
Better yourself daily.
Life is a journey, Not a race.
Say less, Do more.
Nothing ever stays the same. This too will pass. https://t.co/gYcXA1qICW
