The word "hope" as a lifeline. Sturdy enough?
I say this w/ admiration, not snark, vis-a-vis Comey's flair for detail. I look forward to his first mystery novel.
Comey's manner &amp; meticulousness make this an unfair (so to speak) fight. He holds the huge he-said/he-said advantage over Trump.
To translate: Even before many dealings w/ Trump, Comey knew from watching him that he was a habitual (and dangerous) liar. Wow.

Trump can half- or quarter-convincingly play many things. The noble victim is not among them.
And another of those moments? Trump critiquing her stamina after 90 minutes in which she's spoken more clearly and steadily than he.
Watching debate with someone who is not a political insider and has big Clinton reservations. His summary: "Trump's nuts! Unhinged."
The fact-checking of Trump's stubborn insistence on his early Iraq position is NOT going to go well for him. But then the debate hasn't.
Of all that Clinton practiced, clearly nothing more than expression while Trump talks. Not overly dismissive or derisive. More . . . amused.
"Someone sitting on their bed who weighs 400 pounds." How did we get to an obese shut-in? #TrumpBlather
Trump's main task here was to seem presidential. Mainly seems peeved.
People talk about a debate being defined by just a few moments. Trump's self-congratulation for the birther crusade is one of those.
This birther bit is just surreal. Hard to imagine a more nonsensical response from a candidate. And Trump EXPECTED the question? Terrifying.
Based on first hour: Trump decided not to provoke or needle as in primary debates. Turns out not that many other arrows in his quiver....
It's astonishing how much of the last 20 minutes have been Trump reacting to her. Not good for him.
Here's a key thing, when you pull back. So far, Clinton has played more offense than defense, Trump more defense than offense.
If he can release his tax returns if she releases emails, then the audit is NOT preventing the release, right? But we knew that.....
Wait. Trump says Clinton has been fighting ISIS her entire adult life?!? Either she's MUCH younger than we thought, or . . .
"Donald, I know you live in your own reality," Clinton says. He keeps looking toward her. She just looks straight ahead.
If you're applying the sound-off rule to this debate, she so far looks calm, confident. He looks mad.
Clinton just got in her first rattle-Trump reference to his business success perhaps not being all that impressive . . .
Wow. The Trump surrogates think he'll do great. The Clinton surrogates think she will. Illuminating pre-debate commentary!
Before we proceed to second-guess &amp; pick apart all these 2 candidates say, let's acknowledge the steel nerves it takes to step out there.

An oddity of watching the debate on local TV in N.H.: commercial breaks with ads for Carly Fiorina, who's not on the stage.
Stop the presses! Trump mentioned polls.
Someone NOT a pundit or insider emails: "This debate makes me wish it were 3-way race: Bush, Christie, Kasich." A widespread reaction?
It wouldn't be a debate without a kidding Carson reference to being passed over and without him being right.
Triply strange about Rubio tonight is that he's been looser, less programmed, DEFT on the trail over recent days. So why the robot now?
If N.H. doesn't turn everything around for Christie, it will NOT be for lack of trying.
Rubio AGAIN responds to Gang of Eight criticism with the same general anti-Obama refrain. He's making Christie's case for him.
One hopes the candidates' returns to the stage won't be as staggered, clumsy and just plain bizarre as those baffling entrances.
In past exchanges, Trump sometimes got the better of Jeb Bush. Not then. A total turnaround. And not just because the crowd booed.
It would be great if Trump, as he again promises something wonderful from a Trump administration, would specify what that something is
Kasich is supposed be a possible N.H. surprise. He was almost left backstage. He hasn't received a chance to speak.
Why is Rubio, just accused of repeating the same line over and over, responding by repeating the same line over and over? Plain weird.
Cruz's trail refrain is how untrustworthy the media is, but his defense of what happened in Iowa is that he was trusting the media
"It gives you a very good example of certain types of Washington ethics," says Carson of what Cruz campaign did. Deft twist of the knife.
It's like Cruz is playing the drums with that tapping on his lectern. Debate percussion.

"The United States Senate is just like grade school," says Christie. A dig at Rubio, but these are folks whose favor he'd need as POTUS
"First-term senators . . . we cannot have those type of people in the White House," says Christie, tarring Obama, Rubio, Cruz with one brush

Great "progressive" answer from Clinton, but bringing up DOMA? Which Bill Clinton signed? Strange inclusion.
So strange, given Clinton's history on healthcare, to hear Sanders portray her as insufficiently ardent on universal coverage. Not right.

Important, soul-searching column by @Ron_Fournier: How Government – and This Columnist – Failed Flint, https://t.co/SpUVuoGOKi
Clinton just got a gift: opportunity to highlight that she HAS relationships with world leaders.
Extent and proper-noun-barrage of Clinton's Syria answer reflect her belief that she has foreign-policy advantage over Sanders.
This night is shaping up to be for Hillary/Bernie what Thursday was for Donald/Ted.
Assertive, emphatic, voice growing hoarse, Sanders is debating like a man who only recently said to self: Wait, wait, maybe I CAN win.
Sanders may be older, but Clinton's approach here is definitely: I'm the grownup. #DemocraticDebate
The health care exchange perfectly underscores the rival brands: Clinton as realist, incrementalist; Sanders as furious and done with that.
It's such an adjustment, after the crowded R debates, when these D debates begin. It's like an under-attended party. Where is everybody?

Resist "siren's call" of "angriest voices," says Nikki Haley in her #SOTU response. Translation? Tune out Donald Trump. (Cruz, too.)
In an odd way, Trump is the sire of this speech.
Interesting how much of this speech is an exultant insistence on America's potency, a point-by-point retort to Donald Trump
"It has been difficult to find agreement over the last seven years," Obama says. We noticed.
Paul Ryan's muted, flickering facial expressions are an inscrutable argot all their own. #SOTU

@NACAC (4/4) and that prestigious schools CHASE prestige. Selectiveness doesn't always equal quality. Not at all. #NACACreads
@NACAC . . . (3/4) I hope they realize that labels fall off &amp; fade, while learning/intellectual curiosity/engagement endure ... #NACACreads
@NACAC (2/4) I hope they realize that life is longer and bigger than a few months of  senior year of HS; it's a marathon . . . #NACACreads
@NACAC Number One: Think as much about smart ways to USE college (hint: maximum engagement) as about getting in (1/4) . . . #NACACreads
. . . (3/3) So divert energy spent on gaming admissions to cultivating those qualities. Can do that at HUNDREDS of schools. #NACACreads
. . .(2/3) they're judging you by your PERFORMANCE. Your ENTHUSIASM. Your SKILLS. Your CHARACTER . . . (2/3) #NACACreads
Another thing to emphasize to kids: Ten years out of college, NO ONE is judging you by your alma mater (1/3) . . . #NACACreads
.@TheCareerKey "Well-intentioned BUT" says it all. I'd capitalize the "but." Read this by my colleague: https://t.co/okxrMfMqfE #NACACreads

RT @KarenMGraziano: There's so much to get excited about at every school out there! #NACACreads #BeyondTheRankings @FrankBruni
. . . (4/4) parents have inadvertently stolen something from them: a sense of wonder, an attention to EDUCATION. #NACACreads
. . . (3/4) and whether the name of the school would impress people sufficiently. In trying to buoy/advance their kids . . . #NACACreads
(2/4) I remember when "going to college" was a phrase packed with exhilaration, not the dread of WHERE that would be . . . #NACACreads
So much gets lost in this mania: the blessing of almost ANY college education; the thrill/opportunity of this chapter (1/4) #NACACreads
@NACAC (3/3) and we need a new language ("dream school," "reach school," "safety school") #NACACreads
@NACAC (2/3) . . .but the college CONSUMERS (parents/kids) need not to be impressed by lower acceptance rates . . . #NACACreads
@NACAC (1/3) I’d like to see more colleges challenge/opt out of US News rankings, which aggravate the problem . . . #NACACreads

Thank you, Alex. The book comes straight from the heart. https://t.co/uWvWArIzhZ
.@LovettCollegeCo . . . (2/2) that they understand this is about REAL happiness/health/success. This is RESPONSIBLE. #NACACreads
.@LovettCollegeCo When u say to parents, "focus less on prestige," it sounds defeatist to them, so it's vital (1/2) . . . #NACACreads
.@NACAC A3: Compile and invoke distinguished people who benefited from bolder college choices; there are many #NACACreads
.@TaniaRachkoskie I think greater damage is the values they pick up along the way to college, due to cynical frenzy to get in #NACACreads
@Rulo123 @GreerKelley Since when is Obama "my pal"? I must have missed the last pot-luck dinner invite. #NACACreads
@NACAC (6/6) Those are just SOME of the mania’s/frenzy’s troubling effects. #NACACreads
@NACAC (5/6) Kids thinking all effort is about the dividend, not the passion . . . #NACACreads
@NACAC (4/6) Kids thinking life yields to precise, cynical, pragmatic scripts of the kind they followed to get in . . . #NACACreads
@NACAC (3/6) Such as kids thinking that “getting in” to an exclusive realm is the whole endeavor . . . #NACACreads
@NACAC (2/6) But we need to realize how many OTHER effects of the frenzy there are . . . #NACACreads
@NACAC (1/6) Some negative effects are obvious: anxiety, depression, sleeplessness, a corrosive perfectionism . . . #NACACreads
.@GreerKelley By showing them, over and over, that ranking/name WON'T guarantee success and, if obsessed over, can do DAMAGE #NACACreads
@NACAC (2/2) But the edge of brand-name colleges is exaggerated. This must be explained and emphasized #NACACreads
@NACAC (1/2) Admissions mania due largely to economic pessimism; people want every edge . . . @NACACreads

@NACAC (3/4) . . . I noticed energy, discipline, charisma: qualities that no one kind of school monopolizes . . . #NACACreads
@NACAC (2/4) . . . but among adults I admired, I didn’t notice any common thread of fancy diplomas . . . #NACACreads
