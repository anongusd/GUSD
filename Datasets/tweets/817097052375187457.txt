Though the employment rate may be stable overall, it's plummeting for men without college degrees. 	In America, a college degree must not be a barrier to enter the middle class. https://t.co/Zo4f0VT7w9
Because of how we collect data, income inequality — already bad and worsening fast — is likely much worse than we know. 	We need to create an economy where all Americans get a piece of the country's prosperity. https://t.co/bVbnTyjaKZ
Each and every teachers' strike just goes to show: our public sector unions are strong, and they're fighting hard for workers. https://t.co/pVlVJH02iv
That's right: Paid family leave has strong bipartisan support. 	Allowing workers to both care for their families and keep their jobs isn't a Democratic value; it's an American value. https://t.co/eGyYBY5W2w
Thanks to the #GOPTaxScam, the middle class is seeing much smaller tax refunds than last year. We can't let them be victims of a scheme to boost the 1 percent. https://t.co/xRMHxWJN5C
Student loans are crushing our young workers and preventing them from making lifelong investments in housing and retirement. Congress must address this threat to our economy. https://t.co/k2rgVT0Eiu
The average OECD country offers mothers a total of about 55 weeks of paid leave. The average total paid leave for fathers is just over eight weeks. 	Americans come in dead last, with zero guaranteed time off work for new moms and dads.  https://t.co/6aAm714nI4
Great to see Democrats pushing ahead on paid family leave. This policy lifts up workers. No parent should have to choose between caring for their newborn and putting food on the table. https://t.co/Ky5TQTkLf5
In the face of relentless attacks, we're proud to see unions fighting back. They've recently won unprecedented protections for contract workers, and their approval rate is at an all-time high. https://t.co/IlqbmgIkq5
Wages have been stagnant for years, and it's not just bad for workers — it hurts our entire economy. Small businesses are starting to feel the damage. https://t.co/BMCjPJtSQY
The #GOPTaxScam has accomplished NONE of its stated goals. Trillions of dollars still stashed overseas. Loopholes persist. And most importantly, our middle class is still struggling. https://t.co/OJ80OV7BKJ
The jobs numbers may look good, but too many Americans are still hurting. We see you, and we're working hard to give you the opportunities you need to succeed. https://t.co/kgrNLr4bvT

What we feared has come true: Trump’s $1.5 trillion tax scam has done nothing to boost wages or hiring; it's merely padded the pockets of the wealthy. https://t.co/eGe8JWSCYa
We're a mere four days from a second government shutdown as President Trump continues to demand funding for an expensive, unpopular, ineffective border wall. We refuse to let him put federal workers through this again.
Democrats' plan to raise the minimum wage would do more than just give 40 million Americans living wages -- it would help close the wage gap. https://t.co/hykQITDWfw
ICYMI: Last week our members voted to give federal workers the modest, scheduled raise they deserve. Especially after the #TrumpShutdown, we should not treat these public servants as political pawns.
Working people are often overlooked in politics because there simply aren't many of them serving as elected officials. We need to get the big money out of politics and make it possible for working people to represent their communities. https://t.co/bb8qZEd1cs
Despite what @realDonaldTrump said on Tuesday, the reality is he has failed the middle class. CEOs and billionaires are getting wealthier while middle class wages are stagnant, and his tax scam only made that worse. We're continuing to fight for working people.

Had voters in MO approved #PropA they would have probably seen a drop in income, according to economists at the UMKC. Their 2014 study found that MO's shifting to a right-to-work state would result in an annual loss of $1,945 to $2,547 per household. (4/5) https://t.co/ix2AUj0Izc

When it comes to each of these bedrock issues, Democrats have #ABetterDeal. We want to boost middle class families, invest in good-paying American jobs, and empower everyday consumers. Let’s get to work!
Democrats have a real plan to rebuild America that will create 16 million new good-paying jobs building roads, bridges, broadband, schools, water infrastructure, energy grids and transit.
And after all his promises of a big infrastructure bill to create jobs, @realDonaldTrump wants to pass the buck on to short-changed state and local governments while selling our critical highways and infrastructure to big corporations and Wall Street.
Democrats are calling for swift action to protect the pensions that workers have earned, and to put power back in the hands of working people by protecting their freedom to negotiate better wages and better jobs.
From ignoring the growing crisis facing pensions across America, to gutting key protections that ensure workers get a decent wage and good benefits, the GOP won’t stop working against working men and women.
R’s have relentlessly tried to undermine the pillars of Americans’ retirement security. The Trump Budget alone calls for $500 billion in cuts to Medicare, almost $1.5 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, and $72 billion in cuts to Social Security.
Democrats are fighting for real, bipartisan tax reform that puts the middle class first, responsibly reduces the deficit, and creates more good-paying jobs.
The #GOPTaxScam raises taxes on 86 million middle class families and explodes the deficit by an additional $2 trillion – putting Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security on the chopping block for cuts in the name of “fiscal responsibility.”
They passed a #TaxScam which mortgaged the future of seniors and working families in order to hand massive tax breaks to Wall Street, corporations shipping jobs overseas, and the wealthiest 1 percent.

.@realDonaldTrump – This is not the “big league” bipartisan plan you promised to make our crumbling infrastructure great again. Work with Dems and deliver on your promises!
There is bipartisan agreement on the need to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. Dems have proposed real solutions that make direct federal investments and grow jobs in our communities with American-made products. The Trump plan robs Peter to pay Paul.
Over the next 10 years, the #TrumpBudget would make deep cuts:	-Highway and transit safety funding – Down $122B	-TIGER Grant Program (new infrastructure projects) – Down $5B 	-Amtrak funding – Down $7.5B	-Army Corps of Engineers construction – Down $10.1B
At the same time, @POTUS’s budget simultaneously slashes federal spending on vital transportation programs! This makes no sense!
Where does the rest come from? The President thinks state and local governments should pick up the $1+ trillion tab. That means higher tolls for commuters, and smaller budgets for our schools and law enforcement.
The President claims his infrastructure plan invests $1.5 trillion. In reality, it provides only $200 billion – which everyone knows is insufficient for our needs and even @realDonaldTrump concedes is a “small amount.”

American families will also lose; between 2016 &amp; 2040 each household will lose more than $100,000 in total avg. annual disposable income.
Not only will the US see massive job loss, businesses will lose $7 Trillion in sales by 2025 if we fail to close the infrastructure gap.

40 days after his inauguration, @POTUS &amp; @HouseGOP still haven’t lifted a finger to create jobs or ↑ wages for hard-working Americans. /2
