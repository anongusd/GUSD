@DVYancey @PiltdownSupermn @BiblicaCreation @icrbthomas @DineshDSouza When science receives new evidence that impacts current knowledge base they adjust accordingly and retest all over again to confirm. When Christians receive new evidence that contradicts their current understanding, they deny and excuse the evidence. That's the difference.
@PiltdownSupermn @BiblicaCreation @DVYancey @icrbthomas @DineshDSouza Your fallacious responses tell me that you're full of shit.  Just sayin' https://t.co/LjkN2UM9Jx
@danlivni @haivri @EthanASchaal It won't be accepted as long as Israel is illegally occupying the West Bank. If the positions were reversed, Israel wouldn't deal either. Funny how you are blinded by your book of fairy tales that proclaims you the "chosen people". #GTFOH
@NYCREMilton @haivri I have everything to do with humanity Milton. A wise man once said:	"Never be a spectator of unfairness or stupidity. Seek out argument and disputation for their own sake. The grave will supply plenty of time for silence."	We all share space on this planet and you are not special

@DVYancey @PiltdownSupermn @BiblicaCreation @icrbthomas @DineshDSouza Hence my point that I withhold belief until a claim is demonstrated to be true. These are all logically possible. If one is willing to accept anything based on the fact that they don't know everything, then one must accept the tooth fairy, leprechauns, faries, Zeus, etc., etc.
@DVYancey @PiltdownSupermn @BiblicaCreation @icrbthomas @DineshDSouza There are suppositions that our cosmos includes multiple universes &amp; there's no reason to think that it isn't possible. At this point though we have no way of exploring farthest reaches of our universe, let alone potential adjacent universes. I withhold belief until demonstrated
@haivri By what right do you claim this "homeland"? Thank you though for confirming my statement on Israel's illegal occupation and human rights violations. Not to mention that religion is a vile and hateful belief. Primary cause of all terrorism on the planet is 3 Abrahamic religions. https://t.co/ZH7jWa7qcH

@DVYancey @PiltdownSupermn @BiblicaCreation @icrbthomas @DineshDSouza Science says there was a beginning, the Big Bang. Also I'm not aware of any scientists that claim that it all came from absolute nothingness. We don't know anything about the exact beginning, nor anything prior to that. To claim it all came from nothingness has no basis. IMO
@DVYancey @PiltdownSupermn @BiblicaCreation @icrbthomas @DineshDSouza My experience has been that when confronted with those contradictions, Christian invoke special pleading. Example: Everything must have a beginning (created) except God. God is special and has always been. They use "magic" and special pleading to protect their belief from logic.
@BiblicaCreation @RashidaTlaib @AOC @haivri @benshapiro @netanyahu @DrMichaelLBrown @tedcruz A two-state solution is needed but Israel is illegally occupying land in the West Bank in an effort to ultimately annex it as theirs. Israel's borders were clearly defined and agreed to in 1948. They have been over-reaching those borders ever since based on their religion. https://t.co/jlF6N668Pe

@JeffFlake Your hypocrisy is glaring as you condemn her language, yet said nothing when Trump said it. You're a puppet to your party and dismiss the crisis in our country.

@BiblicaCreation @DVYancey @PiltdownSupermn @icrbthomas @DineshDSouza atheism has nothing to do with any of that. Atheism, really simple:	Theist: "God exists"	Atheist: "I don't believe you"	The end!  If you add anything to that you're making shit up &amp; using a straw man argument.	I'm convinced you're a adolescent base on your level of discussion
@BiblicaCreation @RashidaTlaib @AOC @haivri @benshapiro @netanyahu @DrMichaelLBrown @tedcruz So you don't have an example to back up your assertions?

@sandhill11b @emduboisTA @realDailyWire @dreamerhnl Even if they didn't "campaign" and spend campaign monies in the less populated states. They would still get a single vote of their choice equal to all other Americans.
@sandhill11b @emduboisTA @realDailyWire @dreamerhnl It's not the larger states.  This is where you are confused.  It is the majority of Americans no matter where they live. #FFS
@sandhill11b @emduboisTA @realDailyWire @dreamerhnl BTW: It is also not right that each state has 2 Senators unlike the house which is more related to the population. California has forty million people and Wyoming barely has one million. Not democratic.
@sandhill11b @emduboisTA @realDailyWire @dreamerhnl The electoral college has outlived is usefulness.  The people in Iowa in no way is representative of the American people.

@DVYancey @BiblicaCreation Yes, you are more receptive. Cheers,
@DVYancey @BiblicaCreation I don't have to know everything to form a belief. Again, beliefs are not a choice. We just have different standards of evidence for the existence of any gods, or even the supernatural.  That's okay. You're among the 90&amp; of travelers on this planet that believes. I'm not convinced
@DVYancey @BiblicaCreation A very convenient belief structure and you know, there are as many different descriptions of "God" as there are theists. Your belief conveniently for the immorality written in the bible, good for you. Still no credible evidence that it is true. #Skepticism is the rational stance
@DVYancey @BiblicaCreation I don't know what it would take to prove God's existence to me. However, every God described to me, and especially the Christian God of the bible has the attribute of omniscience. So it should know very well what would convince me. Why do you suppose it doesn't convince me?
@DVYancey @BiblicaCreation I'm not upset but you have put up that straw man argument more than once despite the fact that I very clearly explained to you my position. I find that somewhat intellectually dishonest.
@DVYancey @BiblicaCreation We have no evidence that it can happen though.
@DVYancey @BiblicaCreation It only boils down to personal belief and experience because there is no evidence.  Do you really think we would even be having this conversation if there were a God? Why would God create man and the universe and then hide?  It's simply nonsensical at best. https://t.co/vRTQsdi8Sg
@DVYancey @BiblicaCreation Now you're resorting to a straw man argument to shift your burden of proof.	Atheism:	Theist: God exists	Atheist: I don't believe you	THE END!	if you add anything else to my position, you're just making shit up. I don't have to prove that I don't believe.
@DVYancey @BiblicaCreation Since faith can lead one to a truth and lead others to a falsity (tooth fairy), that means that faith is not a reliable path to truth and I care about truth paramount. Would you say the Muslim who believes on faith is wrong? One can believe absolutely anything on faith.
@DVYancey @BiblicaCreation No offense but following your logic I presume that you also believe in the tooth fairy, right?
@DVYancey @BiblicaCreation First, other evidence means it's detectable. It's a mistake to equate that with anything that is not detectable. Again, as a rational being I cannot believe that which has not been demonstrated to exist. That's being intellectually honest. I understand others have different stds.
@GOP @SteveScalise Sorry, you have to come up with a better source than a state-run propaganda network.
@DVYancey @BiblicaCreation The intellectually honest answer is that they are unexplained
@DVYancey @BiblicaCreation So you decided that since you couldn't explain these happenstances... therefore God. I cannot make that unsupported leap, sorry
@DVYancey @BiblicaCreation Yes, evidence anything is possible. Not proof of god(s) nor even anything supernatural. To describe the mind as created is biased toward the divine.  You might not even know you're doing it. The mind came into existence and evolved.
@AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump It was a losing proposition to begin with.  Trump painted himself into a corner and worse, he's out of paint. The Art of The Squeal. lol
@DVYancey @BiblicaCreation I once thought that the human mind was the most wondrously advanced thing known to man.  Then I realized where that thought was coming from. Belief is not a choice. You must be convinced whether for good or bad reasons, but you must be convinced in your mind.
@DVYancey @BiblicaCreation Yes hard solipsism is always a possibility.  But even if it were true we must still live or lives and make decisions based on our perceived reality, so its kind of moot.
@DVYancey @BiblicaCreation The meme should have had a comma to clarify, "I'm not claiming that, I could be wrong". Another sign of intellectual honesty is not accepting anything without evidence to their truth.
@DVYancey @BiblicaCreation I'm an agnostic atheist. I don't claim there is no God. I don't believe because of a lack of evidence. Faith is what people claim when they have no evidence. Rational stance is withhold belief until existence is demonstrated-the null hypothesis. I'm always open to evidence though https://t.co/sXNZ7ueoH9
@DVYancey @BiblicaCreation Correct.  Who knows?  It is unknown, not evidence of a God. We do know that the mind hallucinates when it is deprived of oxygen though. I have yet to hear an anecdotal near death experience where a Muslim saw a Christian God or a Christian who saw Allah.  hmm...
@DVYancey @BiblicaCreation My motto is there is no credible evidence that God exists.	Cheers,

@TomiLahren Considering that Trump didn't even spend a pittance of the monies allocated for border security last year tells me that Trump doesn't agree with your sentiments that we need to secure our borders. He's fixated on a wall which is the least effective way to protect this country.

@thenerdygurl @deeg25 Your logic is very odd to me. Anyhow, I never said you were sexually abused.  The fact that you self-identified with the statement speaks volumes though. For the record I am sure that Melania is attractive to some, obviously, just not to me. Many ugly traits to me, IMO.

@BiblicaCreation Evolution stands or fails on it's own evidence without regard to whether there is a God or not.  As does the God claim stand or fail on it's own evidence without regard to evolution validity.
@BiblicaCreation You keep comparing evolution as if it were an anti-God proposition. Even the Pope and the Church of England accept evolution. It doesn't negate God.	Now that tells me how you became a theist, but I asked you why you became a theist.  What convinced you that there was a God?
@BiblicaCreation I have no opinion on the historicity of Jesus and could care less to argue it. I am interested in the so-called miracles that he supposedly perform, especially the zombie claim.  What evidence do you have that Jesus was anything more than a charismatic activist of his day?
@kim_chee27 @mitchellvii They are direct quotes from the Racist In-Chief.  They are not made up and if you also believe what he said then that is a demonstration that you are a racist as well.
@BiblicaCreation Correct-no one is claiming that any of them are "truths". The scientific communities claim is they don't know how the first life began. There is nothing wrong with "I don't know" as it is the intellectually honest answer.	What do you have to support man being created from dust?
@BiblicaCreation I value truth and I analyze and evaluate evidence on it's own. For instance, I have no opinion whether Jesus actually existed, I'll take that at your word. However the miracles, I require a higher level of evidence.  What evidence do you have, or why do you believe?
@BiblicaCreation You do realize that dictionaries are descriptive and don't define the word don't you? Words can have different "meanings" in different groups etc. An example is theory which means something entirely different to a scientist than it does to a layperson?	It's not important though.
@BiblicaCreation What evidence?  I'm always open to learn more... whatcha got?
@BiblicaCreation You mentioned creationism which would be the counter to abiogenesis.  Evolution is the progression of life after it is already in existence.	Regarding life's origin on this planet (abiogenesis), there are many hypotheses, but none that are conclusive enough to declare a theory.
@BiblicaCreation Who said anything about nothingness? Anyhow, A/Theism relates to what you believe and A/Gnosticism relates to what you know.  A/Theism and A/Gnosticism are not mutually exclusive.  I am a agnostic atheist. I don't believe there's a God but I'm still open to the possibility. https://t.co/2pRrAEsbLv
@BiblicaCreation So I take it you're a Gnostic Theist, no?
@BiblicaCreation There are other sites.  Stanford has a good one.  They all demonstrate the observable proof of evolution.
@BiblicaCreation Again ur statement demonstrates that u don't understand evolution-To begin, evolution has nothing to do with the science of abiogenesis, the study of the beginning of life. Further, if evolution were disproved entirely it would not add one iota of evidence for God nor creationism

@3badbrothers @arenbean @r_little_finger @Jeff81370671 Israel is a much smaller country and it isn't working as they have discovered numerous tunnels. What are you referring to 130B minus 25B?  I'm not following what you are referencing?
@3badbrothers @arenbean @r_little_finger @Jeff81370671 You defensively responded to my calling out those who did call me names.  Then you went to whataboutism, then you went to well I didn't call you a name.  Do you understand how debate works.  If you take the position defending name-calling I will rebut whether you did it or not.

@srob2247 @mitchellvii It is not 100% incorrect in it's substance and it DOESN'T matter who paid for the info.  The facts stand on their own which is why ad hominem is a fallacy.  Trying to disparage the report by tying it to HRC does not change facts.  Sorry
@srob2247 @mitchellvii Thank you for admitting my point that the whole research was initiated by Republicans.  When it's all said and done, it doesn't matter who "paid" for the research.  What matters is that our president is being bribed because he likes golden showers. FACT!
@srob2247 @mitchellvii The Steele Dossier stands on it's own regardless of when it was discovered or who paid for the research.  I notice that you don't deny it's accuracy... Freudian slip?
@srob2247 @mitchellvii NPR: "Steele continued to solicit information from Russian sources that he recorded in his reports as late as December of 2016. Taken together, they form what has become the much-discussed dossier."	Steele worked for Fusion GPS and was hired prior to HRC paying for the info.
@srob2247 @mitchellvii Steele worked for Fusion GPS BTW, not the Washington Free Beacon and was employed prior to HRC campaign paying for the info.
@srob2247 @mitchellvii I never said it existed before Steele was hired.  I said Steele was hired long before, and developed the dossier before HRC acquired the info.
@srob2247 @mitchellvii It's nice to see you reading and researching for a change.  Now just overlook your confirmation bias.  Cheers,
@srob2247 @mitchellvii Steele was hired long before the Washington Free Beacon hired Fusion GPS.	"Steele continued to solicit information from Russian sources that he recorded in his reports as late as December of 2016. Taken together, they form what has become the much-discussed dossier."  Truth hurts
@srob2247 @mitchellvii "After Fusion GPS was initially hired by conservatives, Democrats paid for the phase of the work that included the compilation of the dossier."	Meaning that the Dossier existed before HRC paid for the research.	A bit of cognitive dissonance going on here.
@srob2247 @mitchellvii his research was started by the leaders of the conservative news outlet Washington Free Beacon.	https://t.co/82z3ClDidp

Grandstanding plain and simple and not related to security. Period!
@mitchellvii If you truly believe that a wall is the answer, why aren't you pushing to fund a wall on our norther border?

@CKinuani @fullerd1606 @AiG I don't know anything about your cite.  We have a common ancestor with Orangutanes and Bonobos.	BTW: Even the fucking Pope and the Church of England accept evolution.   But you follow a nutter that believes man coexisted with dinosaurs.
@CKinuani @natesims07 @fullerd1606 @AiG Are you telling me what I believe again?
@CKinuani @fullerd1606 @AiG You see, this is why I cuss.  It was a scientific study... by scientists.  Did you even click on the link?  #FFS	https://t.co/Ft3j8av3jv
@CKinuani @fullerd1606 @AiG True to Christian dishonesty you are lying.  You said I believed that we had "Don't forget their Monkeyman ancestors" and that life came from nothing.  #FFS	Do you believe that saying Goddamn is taking the Lord's name in vain?
@CKinuani @fullerd1606 @AiG I'm not at work and you aren't my fucking boss.  Now answer my question or take the walk of shame.
@CKinuani @fullerd1606 @AiG What answers?  You have only asserted what you believe and told me what I believe.  Answer my question whether saying Goddamn is taking the Lord's name in vain and I'll answer any of your questions.  Don't be afraid to be wrong, you're wrong about a lot of things.

@CKinuani @fullerd1606 @AiG I'm just wondering how much of a fucking child you are that curse words cause you to turn tail and run?	BTW: do you think saying Goddamn is taking the Lord's name in vain?
@CKinuani @fullerd1606 @AiG For someone who started off with ad hominems and telling me what I believe, you know absolutely fucking nothing about having an adult conversation.
@CKinuani @fullerd1606 @AiG Now you know the difference in (your) opinion and scientific fact for which I provided a cite.
@CKinuani @fullerd1606 @AiG copout.  But we all knew you would pull the self-righteous copout, didn't we?
@CKinuani @fullerd1606 @AiG You probably think that saying Goddamn is taking the Lord's name in vain.  lol

@CKinuani @fullerd1606 @AiG Evolution is a falsifiable proposition used every day in modern science for the flu virus, etc.  If you don't know what falsifiable means, it means that it CAN be proven wrong unlike the belief in God which is unfalsifiable.  And guess what?  It has never  been proven wrong.
@fullerd1606 @CKinuani @AiG So then the bible is flawed.
@fullerd1606 @CKinuani @AiG If you are interested in debate and not ad hominem, let me know.  I'm not going to trade barbs with you to assert my point.  Doing so is what ignorant folks do when they are wrong.
@fullerd1606 @CKinuani @AiG A few absurdities in the bible.  	-Man was formed (created) out of dirt	-God flooded the entire earth	-God and Satan wager on Job's faith and his family is slaughtered in the process	-Talking animals and unicorns...		Puhleeze!
@barmore27 @JBaker31826004 loaded question fallacy.  You presume a truth that has not been demonstrated... namely that it is an invasion.

@GeorgiaDirtRoad @reallyo1 @realDonaldTrump Thankfully someone is still able to represent us presidentially while the US is without a leader.
@reallyo1 @TruthinGov2016 We're talking about China, a country that commits human rights violations daily-I'd rather my president not be "chummy" with China, but cautious and deliberate.  Trump is easily swayed with compliments and China knows it.  Trump is "chummy" with China, and that's not a good thing

@realDonaldTrump You fired Flynn for lying to the FBI and never told the FBI about the crime.  You are guilty of obstruction of justice. #ITMFA
@realDonaldTrump And you did not inform the FBI that Flynn lied to them when you knew it when you fired him.  You are guilty of obstruction of justice at minimum. #ITMFA
If he knew, why didn't he disclose that to the FBI.  Isn't that harboring a criminal? @CNNPolitics https://t.co/7rZxDhnsKh
