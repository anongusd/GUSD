@ccmccain You can thaw your turkey by submerging it in cold water. Plan for 30 minutes per pound. Make sure the turkey is in a sealed plastic bag, and submerge the wrapped bird in cold tap water. Change the water every 30 minutes. The turkey should be cooked immediately after it’s thawed.
@ccmccain Hi Caroline, fresh turkeys are kept just below freezing to maintain a crust of ice on the surface, which easily melts when stored in your refrigerator. According to the National Turkey Federation, turkey meat doesn't freeze at 32°F but at a temperature closer to 26°F.
