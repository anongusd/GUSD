@MSNBC Well she's an idiot so who cares
@HillaryClinton @GabbyGiffords @lucymcbath @SpeakerPelosi How is that progress. Michigan has been doing that for years.
@9and10News No it won't. There will still be accidents because people are too stupid and in a rush to pay attention
@Mi350R @ronmills49 @upnorthlive @GOP Couldn't be. Hillary isn't in northern Michigan
@AOC Probably the same as it looked over 30 years ago. Because it's a lie
@RyanAFournier He should wash it out with bleach. If there was ever a real candidate for late stage abortions it would be her. As long as she doesn't run from the clothes hanger
@washingtonpost This pro Confederate talk is ridiculous. It's about history and remembering this nations past. These idiot students should be suspended. And the statue protesters wanting to tear down statues should have their heads beat together
@USMC The Army was the first to raise the flag there. The marines got credit because the did it when it was safe enough for reporters to finally be there. But i still support the marines as well
@nowthisnews The bees are only there when the plants are flowering. After thst it is safe to spray. If they are spraying while plants are flowering there should be fines through the roof
@BreitbartNews She's probably married to the Florida man that was molesting his dog
@HillaryClinton @TXCivilRights You obviously have less brain cells than a dog turd. You weren't bitching when obama was doing it. And you of all people have no right to talk about civil rights you worthless sack of crap
@HillaryClinton @TXCivilRights You obviously have less brain cells than a dog turd. You weren't bitching when obama was doing it. And you of all people have no right to talk about civil rights you worthless sack of crap
@KamalaHarris Our intelligence community isn't very intelligent. And they have been known to lie to serve their own purpose or the purpose of the government so who gives a shit
@BreitbartNews Can't beat the system. Makeup on a pig doesn't make a beauty queen
@ewarren Mueller is the most corrupt part of the investigation. It's all a pot kettle situation
@tybet13 @BreitbartNews You'd think him and kathy the goblin griffen would finally do the world a favor and remove themselves from the living
@ABC I would have shot his worthless ass. One more scumbag off the street
@NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK It's funny they would post this when not 2 weeks ago there was a story about numerous mechanics making complaints about the company's not wanting to fix what was actually broke to save time and money
@oliverdarcy Still trying to run with this crap again. It's gonna be funny when they can't actually show proof
@VignettesA @ewarren Democrats are the treason party
@ynkerose21 @BreitbartNews That's part of the issue. He wasn't even there that day
@AlexBerenson That's the most asinine thing I've heard all day
@newmonic @kathygriffin @KateBeckinsale No but barf bags are available upon request
@BreitbartNews Well he couldn't molest pigs now could he... Cue the puns
@JimP123456 @threesunrises @washingtonpost Unfortunately it will never come out because if it did it would show who was actually behind all the meddling. And she lost because of her own stupidity
@MinniexMae @Zoar28 @lynn_stuart @DangerousUrNot @bobbied100 @GeorgeTNeill @MrDane1982 Hillary didn't lose anything because due to russian interference. That's just more crap the democrats spewed because they lost so bad and they weren't able to put their lying queen psychopath Hillary in the white house
@MarkDice @Millie__Weaver @jack @jack is too much of an assbag to do so or even care. Once a loser always a loser.
@mikehend917 @MichaelGlocklin @angela_awz @BreitbartNews And when duke backed trump the dems lost their shit about it and started calling trump a racist. He and no matter how many times he disavowed it they lied and said he never did
@SpeakerPelosi How about you fire her ass. And why haven't you and your idiot friends going completely bonkers about her being supported by the kkk grand wizard. You just about burnt down the country when he supported trump. And no matter how many times he disavowed it you lied about it
@evil_betch @CalebBurdett18 @KaitMarieox No it's obviously too good for you.
@LStrickland760 @BreitbartNews I was going to sya the same thing
@NBCNews So it won't recommend cnn anymore. Awesome
@kathygriffin All I'm seeing is white supremacist over and over. Those asshats aren't left or right. They are brain dead ass monkeys. But still smarter than you
@nowthisnews Banning just menthol cigarettes is 2 points past brain dead. What is that going to do. Granted they are disgusting but why just menthol. Morons everyone of them
@codeofvets @kwilli1046 Yah cuz the doctors and current science had absolutely nothing to do with it.
@BarbaraBoxer So where were you when hillary was lying through her teeth. Pot kettle bitch
@nowthisnews So just like their clothing and other stuff it is an overpriced piece of garbage. This company needs to be shut down.
@jjvaldez92 @Risin9St4r @FreshVokes @WellsFargo My company was stupid enough to switch us over to them. But thankfully im march it will be finished and i can go somewhere much better
@amber_athey Who gives a shit. I can guarantee over half the people that will comment have told racist joke's of one form or another in high school.
@EllenDatlow @CBarrett93 @JenniferFromme1 @SpeakerPelosi There's no climate crises either.
@FaustKnowsBest @brian_helser @TheEconomist Yes. The brand new Harleys to me look like garbage. They are trying to make them look way too sporty.
@FaustKnowsBest @brian_helser @TheEconomist Yah if you want a yuppie style motorcycle. They have a Harley name but they are just upgraded versions of a crotch rocket which is a waste of money.
@ABC Why is it everyone is alleged. He did it. He admitted to it and got caught. He isn't alleged. He is guilty
@brian_helser @TheEconomist Nope. I love Harley and would still love to have one. But your right. The more these companies upgrade shit the more it costs us. A pick-up should never cost 50,000. Vehicles nowadays are being designed for yuppies. No one needs wifi in their damn car so the kids can be quiet
@brian_helser @TheEconomist Not to mention the fact that a new Harley costs as much as a new truck. Up to 50,000. Even used ones are 10,000 plus. I love Harley but it'll be a cold day in hell when i pay that much for a new bike or other vehicle
@CNN That's a hell of a lot less than what obama care cost everyone. And still is
@HillaryClinton @staceyabrams They are more than welcome as long as they can do it legally and not come in and start screaming for equal rights and welfare.
@BreitbartNews If god was real or gave a shit this planet wouldn't be full of people like isis. Or the clintons. And where i live global warming doesn't seem to be messing with much here from what i can see.
@ABC It's funny watching someone like her trying to backpedal her ass after getting caught lying. And now the excuses start flowing. Grab your life jackets
@nowthisnews No he didn't
@nowthisnews Yah and over half of that was probably Chicago. And other areas with very strict gun laws
@CuomoPrimeTime @CNN Gillum is an obvious idiot. And true politician. He can't answer a question with a direct answer unless it makes him and his party look good
@huskypackmom @OnlyDeloney @CNN Or your gang https://t.co/dj74bw6X7p
@Wizmazar @CNN She wasn't killed by the U.S. government. She dies because her father refused care
@ewarren @realDonaldTrump A monument to hate huh. Why don't you go smoke your peace pipe and leave the real government work to someone with more brains
@MSNBC Again, who gives a shit. Everything has to be about race with these idiots. And she lies as much as pelosi
@upnorthlive Can't blame him. They are some of the largest crooks ever. They don't usually care about what's actually good for the kids. They just care whether your a man or woman. Men are always guilty. And they usually ruin families instead of help them in any way. That's how they get paid
@NBCNews @NBCNightlyNews So if they are doing them separately why in the absolute hell did they have to combine them. And I'm willing to bet that in less than 2 years they won't allow men to be scout leaders because there are now girls in the boy scouts.
@ovarb_j @selftestok @NBCNews Just like we installed Saddam. And only went after him because he quit doing what he was told.
@CNN So now that she has been caught lying and now wants to run for president she's going to apologize her ass off to get votes
@CBSNews https://t.co/flJZXeCHGX
@BreitbartNews Because it was a democrat. If that was a Republican of any kind him and the other democrats would be calling for his resignation within minutes and would be splattering this all over the news day and night until he resigned
@DeadlineWH @MSNBC @NicolleDWallace As opposed to any other president. It's not like the last 5 have done anything of real significance in their terms. Other than fucking us with no lube or reach around
@ABC Who gives a shit. Woopty doo she's black. That woman should be in a straight jacket. She's nuttier than a pack of squirrels
@ScottPresler I was banned for 7 day for saying we should just kill a terrorist instead of letting him stand trial. Which to me means twitter supports terrorists
@bigleaguepol Which is 100% illegal. They get funded through taxpayer money. Which means he is taking taxpayer money for political gain.
Once again twitter supports a terrorist. I was was banned for posting this about an isis terrorist on trial https://t.co/Qa2ENGLj5c
@CNN @CNNOpinion If that's the future of it I'm glad i don't believe in it. Didn't realize it could get uglier
@BreitbartNews So she's pushing a ban on sights then. That makes sense
@Ray17278912 Because god doesn't exist. And killing yourself is just stupid. Your life can't be that damn bad.
@SenatorBennet @realDonaldTrump Offensive my ass
@upnorthlive Definitely. And the biggest cry baby in football aside from kapernick or however you spell that morons name
@GraceRandolph @JackPosobiec There's already a Ghostbusters 3 and it was terrible. There should be a 4th to make up for the garbage 3rd
@NBCNews It wasn't about slavery. Lincoln only used slavery later on to destroy the economy of the south thst used almost nothing but slaves for all their work
@RealSaavedra Only since trump wanted it. They were all about it before him
@CNN Who gives a shit. Basketball isn't a sport anyways.
@CNN Check the cover pages. It was probably written by a democrat. Probably Hillary's family
@9and10News Or maybe it's the fact that it costs way to much to learn something you can't find a job for.
@oliverdarcy @davidgshortell Like the way you guys tweet or report shit irresponsibly all the time without facts. Your a douchebag
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP Wait since when does the fbi do anything to for national security. They are only around to do the bidding of people like you and anyone the democrats want investigated. Not to mention the unknown number working behind the government's view and reach
@AnnCoulter @01ProudAmerican Not even close. The so called news doesn't give this much coverage about pedo priests or the pope.
@nytimes So nancy pelosi is letting her family roam the streets now i guess
@Rambobiggs @PrisonPlanet Boondock smirks	Blazing smirks	7 brided for 7 smirks	Independence smirk
@Variety @maggieNYT @Marvel It was only nominated because it features a black superhero especially after everyone made such a big deal out of it. The movie is crap
@nowthisnews These people do know that there is a thing called unemployment right. It's not much but they will get money.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump None of which will keep people from crossing illegaly. And scanners for drugs won't work when they are brought across by illegals not crossing at ports of entry. You are completely idiotic to assume ports of entry infrastructure upgrades will help with illegal entry. Just stupid
@ABC She was all about it when it was from her king obama.
@MSNBC @GarrettHaake Maybe. But we all know nancy would
I was temporarily banned for this. But my statement still stands. She's a worthless whore https://t.co/TEv2aj84y0
@MSNBC How. By saying she wasn't allowed to use military aircraft to fly there. Big damn deal. She shouldn't be going anyways
@HillaryClinton Maybe you should answer for the billions stolen from Haiti first. Or the truth behind benghazi. Or maybe many many other things. Don't point fingers with a basement full of skeletons
@nytimes Let me guess. It was oliver darcy. They both root around in the mud to feed
@Roku Being a far left platform and constantly spreading false statements and hatred please remove cnn from your platform. They spread hatred and are known to bully many people and organizations
@johnwas70733910 @RetroDess @nowthisnews I think it's funny how they keep saying our climate is warmer and warmer every year when in 2011 or 12 it was over 100 every day of the summer in Michigan and it hasn't been that hot since then. On top of the lies about the polar ice caps melting
@7thdaughter1 @g_rollo790 @RepEscobar @SpeakerPelosi Our constitution doesn't cover other countries. It covers us. No one else in the world is automatically entitled to our constitution or bill of rights.
@oliverdarcy What does that bitch need a military plane for. She's not special. Nobody in Congress at any level needs or should have access to military vehicles for any reason.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Stop acting like you actually care about the people or this country
https://t.co/qq63SuPkb4
@oliverdarcy Concerned parties my ass. More like douchebags like you. Your a bigger dysfunction to this country than the democrats in Congress
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump You were all about a border wall when hillary and obama wanted it but because of your hatred for someone that actually cares about our country you want nothing to do with it. Your a disgusting disgrace to the government.
@SenGaryPeters You should be looking into where over 8 trillion dollars of federal money disappeared to without a trace.
@gatec1 @abennett102012 @SenSchumer Amazing that the city with the strictest gun laws in all the u.s has that high of a gun crime rate. But we definitely need more gun control
@SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer You guys didn't care so much about obama shutting it down for his oh so wonderful healthcare that was a disaster
@SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer Your a couple of lying fucks
@SenWarren It's been 1 week. People have not missed bills and other shit after 1 week. Way to try and make it worse than it really is. And I'm sure you didn't make this big of a stink when we had a shutdown during obama.
@SpeakerPelosi Liar. There will never be openness and transparency from Congress or anywhere else in government
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Like you give a damn about border security
@MSNBC I wish this fat sack of a waste of human space would just step in front of a bus.
@PimpTruth @NooreldinPasha @BreitbartNews There were 144. And their job is dangerous. Mostly in larger cities.
@MSNBC By democrats. Which I'm willing to bet are the only people they poled
@w_terrence He might not be a woman but he is definitely a bitch
@TheOrville @FOXTV Finally. I love this show
@SenWarren And obama was the one that got us started in that shit show in yemen
@SenWarren But where were you when it was being reported numerous times during Obama's term when he was having bombing campaigns that were killing dozens of civilians each time. You didn't give much of a shit then. And he was selling weapons to our so called allies
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump We have not had a government that works for us since the government was founded. And people like you don't care if it works for us or not. It's your own agendas that you care about. The same with all branches of government
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Billshit. I guarantee people still got their paychecks. And ii can guarantee if she was buying him a bike she wouldn't wait until until a few days before Christmas. You people know how to lie with the best of them
@MSNBC He doesn't lie any more than any other president we've had. And a lot less than congress
@thehill He's a survivor because he wasn't even there that day. So he's just an idiot liar
@NBCNews Maybe now the countries they are occupying will do more for themselves instead of relying on our men and woman to die for them
@BreitbartNews A dead end street covered in trash
@HillaryClinton You helped empower isis from the start. We shouldn't be there. It has nothing to do with us and it never has.
@NancyPelosi Your sensible immigration isn't sensible. And neither are you.
@BlazeTV That's funny. But his story is taken from other religions from around the world. Christmas is based on a lie. And back then they didn't have to worry about border security
@NBCNews Who cares. We shouldn't be there anyhow. It has nothing to do with us. Just like iraq and Afghanistan.
@NBCNews @NBCLeftField That's YOUR first mistake. A BB gun is nit a toy. It can kill just like any other rifle. You can't compare a BB gun and a nerf toy that shoots foam
@NancyPelosi You don't give a rats ass about border security. You and the rest of the dems can't get votes if the illegals are unable to cross whenever and wherever
@KewlBri125 @JeffM2869 @nick10_usmc @LibertyHangout @KaitMarieox He never said it wasn't true. He said at that time he had no evidence.
@KewlBri125 @JeffM2869 @nick10_usmc @LibertyHangout @KaitMarieox Dozens doesn't mean plenty. Read an article. Don't just dismiss a damn post if you can't take the time to read something
@KewlBri125 @JeffM2869 @nick10_usmc @LibertyHangout @KaitMarieox https://t.co/Wtj43e1b53
https://t.co/OeAhuDNXkh
@KewlBri125 @JeffM2869 @nick10_usmc @LibertyHangout @KaitMarieox https://t.co/VvmU2TCWRF
@KewlBri125 @JeffM2869 @nick10_usmc @LibertyHangout @KaitMarieox There's one
@KewlBri125 @JeffM2869 @nick10_usmc @LibertyHangout @KaitMarieox https://t.co/HRZTgLwSdG
@KewlBri125 @JeffM2869 @nick10_usmc @LibertyHangout @KaitMarieox And most of the videos have been removed by twitter. As well as googles search results being charged since then
@KewlBri125 @JeffM2869 @nick10_usmc @LibertyHangout @KaitMarieox There's plenty of people claiming multiple shooters. People seeing helicopters with no lights on. Cell phones and laptops being completely wiped by the fbi. The cops being told to shut off their body cams before going up to get him.
@KewlBri125 @JeffM2869 @nick10_usmc @LibertyHangout @KaitMarieox Do some real research. Or just keep being dumb and believe everything your told
@NancyPelosi Close it down. You idiots don't deserve a job anyways. You should be included in one of the large investigations
@KewlBri125 @JeffM2869 @nick10_usmc @LibertyHangout @KaitMarieox It had nothing to do with a damn bump stock. He may have done a little shooting but he was a patsy from the beginning. He was not the only person shooting. And we still want to know about the blacked out helicopters that were pinging as commercial airliners until getting there
@RealSaavedra Well he's an idiot obviously
@tictoc Prime example of why we should designate a far off deserted island to ship certain people to. Quickest way to eliminate stupidity
@robrichards01 She's gorgeous. They are probably bullying because they have to spend forever putting on makeup to look as good as her without it
@nowthisnews Or you can pull up your big boy panties. Stop being a bitch and drink real milk
#VoicesaveReagan
@nytimes "He" had hiv and ended up with pneumonia. Plus this loser had been deported a number of times for various crimes. "He" ended up sick on top of an already dangerous disease.
@nytimes Not even close. An email to set up appointments verses a private server being used for classified information then deleting and acid washing everything after being subpoenaed to hand everything over.  Not the same in any possible way
@NBCTheVoice @KymberliJoye @tashacobbs She's good. But can we please get rid of that stupid Jennifer Hudson. Watching her and listening to her talk is like walking through a briar patch naked.
I would tell that school to stuff the penalty up their ass. BBC News - Parents have 'no regrets' over honeymoon holiday https://t.co/sPs9ajhERE
@nytimes Bullshit. Many have. She just wants to stay in the spotlight like her idiot husband
@elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump Well if you and your dumb party would fight more to keep them out instead of opening the doors to every person that steps up instead of doing it legally we wouldn't have to have troops there stopping them. Use your brain you mental case
@StephenAtHome That's what we've heard. How else could you have got your job lying every night
@colbertlateshow He's better than the last one. Your a loser colbert. How do you still have a job. Your not smart enough to operate a door handle. Whoever decided to put your talentless ass on TV should be slapped until they can't stand. You get paid to do nothing but lie on a daily basis
@nytimes Bullshit. I live in the northeast and it's supposed to be around the 40s here. It's been way colder in past years. Stop spreading your garbage
@lookmahvelous @BichanichK @Cernovich So i guess cnn is the true rating huh. I don't watch any of them.
@lookmahvelous @BichanichK @Cernovich It's already been a witch hunt. There's already been proof out that obama and Hillary set the whole thing up but people like you don't believe any of it. And which historians rank him as the worst. Because he already has a higher approval rate at this point than obama did
@lookmahvelous @BichanichK @Cernovich You don't understand that every president we have ever had has lied and done nothing for us. All for themselves. And the worst people are sitting in the senate and Congress. And so far whatever he is supposedly doing just for himself is working for the country as well
@lookmahvelous @BichanichK @Cernovich Then your not paying attention. And just because fat little kim said he agreed to something doesn't mean he will do what is expected of him. At least trump didn't pay him millions and allow him to build nukes. Unlike our last president with another country.
@lookmahvelous @BichanichK @Cernovich What the hell does thst have to do with him running our country. He can't force other leaders to stop doing something. We don't control the world regardless of what the democrats seem to think
@nowthisnews Your so full of shit. He's suggesting areas be somewhat cleaned up.
@lookmahvelous @BichanichK @Cernovich Oh i don't know. Maybe because the economy is coming back. He's treating deals with worls leaders like business deals. All we've ever had is politicians or actors. And he's done better so far
@elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump How's that. By making them have to get an i.d first. Oh those poor people. It's a real shame people have to prove who they are before they vote
@lookmahvelous @BichanichK @Cernovich In a way it is and he has proven that.
@MSNBC Removing a pass to get into the Whitehouse is not a violation of any rights or amendments. Getting a pass to talk to the president is more a privilege. He needs to tone back his arrogance about 90 points and stop lying about shit
@CarlHigbie @JohnJamesMI He lost because of all the support from vets and farmers. She may be a democrat but when it comes to vets she'll destroy people or companies to get vets the care they need. And deserve. And she's a big name in the farming community as well.
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Mueller needs to be replaced and face charges for his crimes in Chicago. And have an extensive investigation into his own past.
@SenSanders Muellers investigation is a witch hunt. If he was a real investigator he wouldn't just be going after Republicans. He would have allowed the investigation into hillary instead of halting it. And he would be in prison for years of criminal activity in Chicago.
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Mueller is a crook. Always has been and always will be. That's why bulger was killed. And why Hillary got off of her crimes. As are you. And it was already the plan after the election to fire sessions you twit.
@CNN That was supposed to say was. Not "waz"
@CNN If that waz my kid talking like that and throwing something at the teacher i would beat his ass after the teacher was done with him. Kids now days need an ass beating anymore. They think they deserve everything and can't be heald accountable
@RealSaavedra She can ban assault weapons all she wants. If anyone ever finds out what an assault weapon is. Because it doesn't actually exist. And an ar15 is nothing but a 223 rifle. So she would have to ban every semi auto 223 rifle. Along with every other semi auto ever made.
@SenFeinstein If they are not a threat then why would they be chanting no more America and be burning the U.S. flag on numerous occasions. And what about all the children that have gone missing in the caravan. And the garbage they leave wherever they are. And the attacks on police.
@nytimes It's not new data. Stephen Hawking and many others already had papers and data on it 20 plus years ago.
@NancyPelosi @HouseDemocrats Bullshit. All they care about is themselves.
@MyClientsLoveMe @ABC Hahaha. I had to read it twice. I thought i misread it the first time. I was going to make up some smartass remark but i can't after thst one
@MyClientsLoveMe @ABC That is great.
@sethmeyers Your such a lying piece of shit. It's not fear mongering when it's true. And sending troops to the border is what is needed. Part of his job is protecting our borders and that's what he's doing. But your obviously too stupid to know anything other than what your told to say
@intelligent50 @alllibertynews @jdeclue @ezvic420 @LottaKerfuffles @d_robby3 @AgainstSage @DroneTheFed @SeanMPlace @NIA_Anarchist @Ltdsoltd @JonasAfrend @FlorisvandenBe3 @NoahHerschberg @TheLibertysmith @Octotron @sir_mycroft @Urimountains @KatyOldenburg @cornfef @ty2010b @Whichsideareuon @Muttonchap @SSG_Davis_Ret @MrQuindazzi @Suck_my_bress @AllanHazen @lolnochillwavve @kageneko @brycejacksoncvt @JoeyMinnesota @MindyVaughan13 @LPNational @realDonaldTrump @GOP @BillGates @NickHanauer @jack @larryellison @JeffBezos @tim_cook @JerryFalwellJr @CBNNews @PopSci @CNET @PCMag @RandPaul @SenSanders @MikeCrapo @RonWyden It went up by trillions during obama as well. Congress is the problem. The feds more so. Our economy starts getting better and the fed raises interest rates too soon and fast which explodes the national debt. So blame the right people
@CNNTonight Why isn't don lemon getting fired. You fired others for less. He's part of the problem
@CNNTonight @CNN The military caries plenty of tear gas. And c.s. gas will make 90 percent of them crap their pants once it hits them. That shit sucks.
@KaitMarieox So your one of those people huh.
@MSNBC Bullshit lies. Roger stone took 2 lie detector test with with 2 different people and passed both with flying colors. But don't bother mentioning that.
@ABC Falsely my ass. Obama is the one that started it. It was his rule.
@antonioguterres @UN They will be elected if they are qualified for the position. You can't give them a job, man or woman, if they are not qualified to do the job
@SethAbramson @LauraLoomer sure looks legit to me.  https://t.co/uNGGfYfe1C
https://t.co/uNGGfYfe1C
@AC360 @CNN @TomSteyer So where was your tampon looking ass during obama and black lives matter.
@Rambobiggs Looked like Napoleon dynamite in action then his pug humping a teddy bear
@CNN @CillizzaCNN She can. But if she opened her mouth you asshats and the others would have gone through the roof screaming like chickens on fire
@oliverdarcy It wasn't a bomb. It was fake. No matter how much you call it a bomb it will never be a bomb.
@oliverdarcy So trump can be blamed for one fake bomber. And a leftist shooting up a mosk but hillary and obama walk scot free for getting men and woman killed in benghazi and leaving them there. And then they completely lied about it
@Telegraph They should have a dislike button too
@oliverdarcy @wolfblitzer They weren't bombs. They didn't even have the capability of exploding because there was no explosive material in them. And he didn't do it alone obviously. He couldn't have delivered every one of them at the same exact time. And none of it went through the actual mail
@Gaidheal_Alaska @mrsocial78 @StephenGutowski Not to mention the so called gas attacks with all this Syria shit. The false nerve gas attacks that were proven false just by having a reporter there on scene
@CNN That thing is a man. It will never be a woman
@NathanLerner Your obviously an idiot. I'd like to know where they've made it so hard to vote. If they did the only ones they made it hard for are the illegals and the paid democrats being bussed in to vote under someone elses name
@NBCNews @NBCOUT Quit saying she. That thing is not a she. It never will be. HE was born with a penis and will always be a HE.
@nytimes Nobody cares what this troll thinks. He has never been too bright anyhow
@oliverdarcy Well the so called bombs were fake. There was nothing about them that made them a bomb. The clock with no alarm and still had the plastic number stickers on them. Plastic pipes. And stupid red and black wire going to each end. Looks like something the coyote would buy
@Timodc They are not walking. There are numerous flatbed trucks hauling a good majority of these people.
@DeadlineWH @NicolleDWallace Your stupid. It's most common meaning is putting your country or nationa ahead of all others and taking care of ourselves. Which is exactly what we should be doing. We shouldn't be fighting other countries wars and paying for their problems. We have our own country to worry about
@oliverdarcy The only ones calling for violence are the democrats.
@LIKISSfan1979 @DawnparksDawn @CBSNews No they just call for violence at every turn. And for years now
@AnnWise83021614 @kmo6241 @rcrfan @pw_male @wilfredodiazPR @HillaryClinton @DNC Never
@oliverdarcy @jeffzeleny Because they were bullshit and a set up. If they were real they would have gone off. A few people you banned called this days ago
@AnnWise83021614 @wilfredodiazPR @kmo6241 @pw_male @rcrfan @HillaryClinton Read the damn article. It was all non profit and religious organizations. Then defence contractors in 2008. Which means Obama. Who is also the person that started this shit in the first place. Oh but he's black so it's ok but trump is white so he's a Nazi.
@Rambobiggs They ran out of ideas on good horror movies after the exorcist years ago
@pw_male @rcrfan @AnnWise83021614 @kmo6241 @wilfredodiazPR @HillaryClinton That's funny because trump has already done more in 2 years than Obama had in 8.
@FoxNews @POTUS This is a good start to the wall https://t.co/9d9IDfQdke
@KenKalDRW Let's not forget the wolverines. Way more important than the pistons

@BreitbartNews Bullshit. They are not afraid of these stupid lunatics.

@ABC She needs to face 2 charges. Not just child abandonment but child abuse as well for carrying him like she did
@grammielynda @nytimes She tried. But he refused to transfer her prescription to another store.
@kensara8 @nytimes No. It was not intentional. They wanted the child
@nytimes He was an employee at meijer in northern Michigan. Meijer supported his decision in a statement. Just another reason they are a terrible company

@SenWarren The tax cuts have nothing to do with the deficit going up. Even you should be smart enough to know that one but obviously not.
@Lazulioness @TwitterSafety @Twitter Because anyone on the left that disagrees with someone they call them a bot and would report them any chance they get. Instead of having an actual intelligent conversation. Which is obviously beyond their intelligence

@Breaking911 What a dumb bitch. She should be sitting in jail for her stupidity
@nytimes It's not a contradiction. Republicans aren't going around attacking people and shutting down traffic and throwing piss on people. It's the left. So nice try but most people are not as dumb as you
@HillaryClinton All thanks to you and Obama

@SenWarren @SenatorTomUdall They still have home addresses. And they are passing the laws because people are lying about who they are and voting for others when they aren't there. And it's your party doing it
@SenSanders Your so full of shit. The koch brothers have been democrat supporters forever. And it's the democrats that have been screwing with elections and the election process
@RobFromCincy @KaitMarieox @realDonaldTrump So what facts does she need to get straight. Antifa is against the Republican party and the democrats don't say a word about them. And they are basically allowed to run around and do as they please. They are terrorists and need to be dealt with at an extreme level
@markhughesfilms I'd like to know how this has to do with jr. And how is this bad when dems have the disgusting protesters outside congress and the domestic terrorists antifa. The dems are crooked as a bed spring

@SenateDems @PattyMurray Patty your an idiot. He was reacting just as any man would who was being falsely accused by someone your people help fake a story for to keep him from being nominated

@tommyleeedwards @FoxNews @PhilippeReines There was nothing legitimate about the accusations. He wasn't rude at all compared to how the dems treated him. And trump has done more for us in 2 years than the last 4 presidents. Quit mocking bullshit from garbage news.
@CBSNews There's a whole lot of whiny little bitches on here. This whole thing was created by Obama but he never got around to actually testing it. It's been set up on cell phones for years now. Get over it.
@jeandeux2020 @CBSNews He's the one that created. He just never tested it. It's been on cell phones for years
@WilDonnelly @DonaldJTrumpJr @CNN @JeffreyToobin She was only found innocent because of Mueller who is her lacky. Along with many others that were in the fbi. That bitch still needs to be in prison and anyone who believes she is actually innocent of anything has less brains that a tree stump
@SenateDems How can anyone keep their demeanor when your being falsely accused of this shit then turn around and have you asshole democrats try everything possible to destroy him during the hearing. And you criminal assholes have no room to talk about lying. Russia. Benghazi. And many more
@nowthisnews These people are stupid. He's not going to overturn abortion.
@rescuingcujo @_SJPeace_ @DonaldJTrumpJr And at obama for being the one to actually start this shit that somehow trump gets blamed for. A democrat could shoot you then file charges against you because you got blood on there bullet.
@NBCNews Yah I'm sure they are. Just like he put kids in cages right. Or colluded with putin to win the election. Your as trustworthy as a rattlesnake babysitting a toddler.
@nowthisnews He's right. The only time they think is when they have to decide who they are going to slander from day to day
@NancyPelosi Who gives a shit. Those are other countries. Your worried about that crap when other countries kill woman for not covering their whole body. Your a washed up government official that needs to retire and head straight to prison
@colbertlateshow @jaketapper Just like the democrats. And go figure, CNN.

@elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump And the democrats are screwed
@BreitbartNews And your Hillary's puppet. And she George soros puppett.
@KarmicTimes @HillaryClinton @runforsomething That's cute. If your against hillary your a Russian bot. Especially when she was the one that started the fake russia shit. So then the trolls block you because they are too stupid to have an actual discussion
@BarackObama I see a lot of names in Michigan i will never vote for if your corrupt ass is endorsing them
@BreitbartNews Nope. He would have voted democrat. A lot of dead people seem to vote democrat. Plus he was a trouble maker and a liar so thst fits as well
@nowthisnews That's funny because after obama was in office all these people did was lick his boots for peanuts. And they treated trump even worse as soon as he was elected.
@elizabethforma Who said she wasn't allowed to be angry. Is thst the rule you set for her when coaching her for this. And all democrats will do is destroy more shit.
@RyLiberty @tanabear911 @alllibertynews @cromartieTSCC @GovJVentura A plane that size does not hit the Pentagon and go all the way in with zero evidence of it outside. And it would not have been able to penetrate the Pentagon far enough to disappear completely
@tanabear911 @alllibertynews @cromartieTSCC @RyLiberty @GovJVentura There was security video showing something small flying in extremely fast and exploding out away from the building. Even news helicopters in the area recording moments after with not one single piece of an airplane on the ground
@GMA @Disneyland I want to know why our government would be so communistic that it would separate brothers and sisters from each other in foster care. The foster system in this country is disgusting.
@johnnylemuria @alllibertynews @Whichsideareuon @beerandtokens @nickgillespie @LPNational The only dumb untrue statements are this is a job interview and her story is true. It was in no way a job interview.
@Whichsideareuon @johnnylemuria @alllibertynews @beerandtokens @nickgillespie @LPNational She's lying through her teeth. Her father still works at the c.i.a. her brother works for them and is involved with the group that met with trump jr. And she's a recruiter for the c.i.a. and the hearing the other day was a criminal investigation.
@johnnylemuria @alllibertynews @Whichsideareuon @beerandtokens @nickgillespie @LPNational It wasn't a job interview. He had tje job interview and it went so good the democrats brought in their c.i.a operative with lies. This is now a criminal investigation and criminal court hearing
@empwrurmind @washingtonpost @CapehartJ The job interview ended when the democrats set up this lie and brought her in. It then turned into a sexual assault case. The hearing the other day was a criminal hearing
@FoxNews @SenFeinstein So he's supposed to roll over and take the shit the dem morons were throwing around after starting all thus shit to keep him from being nominated?  You people are beyond despicable.
@BallsDeepState @CaptUGASparrow @KaitMarieox This version of antifa has nothing to do with any of that. This band of idiots is a domestic terror group funded by a nazi collaborator. Stop trying to justify these worthless pieces of shit

@KaitMarieox This is a prime example of why some animals eat their young. Because they know they will turn out to be worthless to the society
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump The betrayal is mueller. He has been in cahoots with hillary and others for years. How do you think this russia shit got started you incompetent moron
@CNN No she said she believes her. But she also said she was never there and has never met kavanaugh. Which means ford lied through her teeth under oath.
@SenSanders None of it is credible. The only thing she could "remember" was kavanaugh. Your party should have done some more digging to come up with a solid story before creating this mess
@nowthisnews I'm guessing it just runs itself in reverse of what was done to it.
@BreitbartNews I'm sure the democrats and c.i.a paid her plenty for lying through her teeth.
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump You idiots will stop at nothing to start shit. Your as useless as tits on a rooster
@oliverdarcy Your the only one that pushes misleading info
@nowthisnews It can't support her claim if she doesn't know what house. What day. Or what year even. Your drawing at straws
@oliverdarcy They should investigate you as well
@elizabethforma Because your a corrupt piece of crap along with the rest of the dems. You guys perpetrated this whole this to because your butt hurt over trump being elected. Your a piece of garbage
@SenSanders He didn't lie about shit. You guys are. You are all disgusting human beings
@SenWarren Your the one lying. He didn't refuse once during the hearing. Maybe you should listen again and turn up your hearing aid. And ford should be investigated as well. Especially since she's a c.i.a asset
@SenGaryPeters How the hell is it credible. She couldn't remember anything other than he was there. And that stupid low crackle voice she used the whole time made her sound like someone calling into work monday pretending to be sick because they are hung over
@Qualcomm Yah by killing people. 5G equals much much higher megahertz but towers have to be closer which means higher radiation for cancer development. I'd rather wait an extra minute for a download than get brain cancer just to watch a YouTube video
@nowthisnews Throw her down the elevator shaft and keep walking. People like her and the democrats are causing all the problems. Kavanaugh didn't do it. You could tell she was lying. So can anyone with a brain
@SenateDems Your obviously lying through your teeth. It's disgusting that you could blatantly lie when everyone watched it. Your a communistic party.
@SenSanders @SenatorDurbin He didn't remain silent. They all said the fbi doesn't come to conclusions. Even the fbi says that. He has been investigated. And asked for it at the start. You people are lying through your geriatric teeth
@NancyPelosi It's not bravery when your a liar. You guys have done nothing but lie and delay for your own interests. You should be fired and imprisoned
@SenSanders Of course you believe her. It was your party that created this crap. She has no evidence. No credible witness and no information on when where or whi exactly. He was investigated and even asked for it at the start but your buddies wouldn't submit. Your as bad as the rest
@SenWarren Your a lying bitch. Your the one without integrity. We heard the hearing. You people are dragging him through the mud for your own personal interests
@BestBuy @Cody Sounds to me like more gadgets for online spying. If people can hack your camera on your laptop and watch your family then your basically turning your house into an all day version of big brother. Without the whiny bitches complaining about each other
@CNN @CNNOpinion It was a un press conference. He wasn't there to defend kavanaugh.
@twjr13 @SenGillibrand @realDonaldTrump Obviously you weren't listening. Another smear of trump misrepresenting what he said.
@PrisonPlanet @krassenstein @EdKrassen I watched the whole video and it nowhere shows it was the brother recording. So prove it was fake.
@PrisonPlanetTV @GOP 	What a shock. Hillary working with ford lawyer. https://t.co/76csIvGcoq
@HillaryClinton Sorry but most ordinary people can't pull off voter fraud and lies about russia
@ButImAWoofer @realDonaldTrump Not to mention obama raised the debt sealing almost twice per year while in office to pay the already overpaid congress and himself
@ButImAWoofer @realDonaldTrump So since trump took over in January of 2017 it has only gone up to 21 from 20. Obama had years where it went up by 2 trillion a year. Trump is doing no better and definitely no worse that previous administrations.
@DylanSAYSS @zpshen57 @ButImAWoofer @realDonaldTrump No it was at 9 trillion. It was at 19 when trump took office and has gone up by 1 since then.
@PrisonPlanetTV @PayPal @GOP @Twitter  https://t.co/nK9KTPV20R
@RepMarkMeadows That's the problem. The democrats have everything to hide and no shame for any of it.
@elizabethforma The only charade comes from you and the other corrupt as hell democrats. They are the ones lying and creating this crap.
@PrisonPlanetTV I just read the bio of George soros on his osf website. You want a good laugh take a look. All about him and his family resisting evil and nothing about him being a Nazi collaborator and helping in the deaths of thousands of jews. What a loser
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Mueller should have been fired years ago due to his cooperation in getting hillary off on charges. The three of you should all be in prison rotting
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP @SpeakerRyan Mueller is notorious for not following the facts. Rosenstein needs to be fired along with mueller and you.
@PayPal4Business I don't have a PayPal email because i would never do business with a company that eliminates an companies account for political reasons.
@nowthisnews So if ted cruz had a drunk driving hit and run you and the dems would be all over it. But "Robert" Orourke has a police record and we hear nothing. Imagine that
@Boco_EC @Twitter It wasn't for no reaso. It was political. All because they are run by and lick the boots of the democrats.
@BetoORourke Record security? Are you completely stupid? They are filing across the border at record numbers thanks to obama and the other brainless democrats like you that want to give them everything under the sun. Including voting rights without citizenship.
@leroy_weiler @SenWarren @SecPompeo That never happened. It was fake news. Obama is the last one to have an arms deal with saudi at 112 billion. With trump is was just a discussion of them making a wish list basically of what they want but with lower oil prices the saudis can't even afford to pay the last deal off
@elizabethforma It shouldn't be your choice what gets voted on. It's the peoples choice. Your only job is to do what you were elected for And that doesn't include spouting off. lying about trump and other republicans then sitting on your ass your ass only voting on what makes you rich
@FoxNews So she has a police report and doctors statement and it's a fabrication but ford had zero evidence and we had to believe every word of it.
@kwilli1046 @Jon__Cobb Neither. All 3 are politically motivated for dems
@PayPal4Business You people are disgusting. Paypal should be boycotted until the company folds under. You remove people for political support. Your a bunch of fascist bastards.
@JAS16AZ @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Obama and bush were the worst presidents ever. And the scam has always been democrats.
@Maureen16438650 @dennisofvenice @HillaryClinton No he created a race war. And him and hillary used putin as a pawn to lie about trump. And this so called trade war is a joke. China has had tariffs on us for years. Trump is smart enough to act.
@CNN Good try cnn. Next
@DRUDGE_REPORT Awesome. Justice as ut should be
@9and10News @dmlyden9and10 I dont believe in god or religion and think it's a bad thing but the group involved in getting this video taken down should have every members head cracked open. I want the video if anyone has it because i am going to spread it
@MeetThePress @AishaMoodMills It wasn't a fluke. It was Americans tired of the treason and corruption and lies after lies acter lies from the communist democrats
@MeetThePress @AishaMoodMills @realDonaldTrump Or government and especially the fbi and cia have been treasonous for many many years. And some of it has been coming out in text messages with fbi agents involved. You People are stupid
@CNN Well we probably shouldn't take advice from a murderer and crook. Her ass should be locked away in the deepest part of prison
@Maureen16438650 @dennisofvenice @HillaryClinton He was nowhere near as good a president as trump. And no they didn't respect him. They walked all over him because they knew he didn't have the balls to do anything. Just look at the visit to china. They refused to pull the stairs up for him and fought with his people.
@Maureen16438650 @dennisofvenice @HillaryClinton We were the laughing stock under obama. Trump has enough balls to call people out and do what needs to be done.
@NancyPelosi So far there has been nothing credible about her story. But leave it to you and your corrupt buddies to already call it credible. Moron
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump It's not misleading you worthless ass. You and your people are the scum of america and should all be in prison
@KylieJenner @Cernovich Your an idiot. There's absolutely no reason in hell why you or your idiot family should be famous
@DRUDGE_REPORT I wonder how many times he had to apply Chapstick from licking his lips while talking about it
@FoxNews Who the fuck is she to demand the fbi do something. They can't be trusted to wash dishes.
@CNN Another fake cnn story. It was obviously meant as a joke but leave it to cnn to lie at the same time they are wanting an apology for someone posting a fake story about their idiot reporter
@MSNBC Does this psychopathic bitch ever quit lying. And who is she to talk about due process or a case about sexual assault when she defended a rapist and was heard bragging about getting him freed.
@jaketapper So it's ok for cnn and it's reporters to lie on almost a daily basis about trump or other people who speak out against them or the government but when someone does it to them they start freaking out and want apologies.
@FoxNews Unless it's an accusation about a democrat. You know like bill clinton. Or others
@oliverdarcy @andersoncooper Oh like the lies you guys spread against alex jones then fight for him to be banned when confronted like cowards. Or the lies you all spread about Trump.
@BestBuy Nope. The smart homes are dumb enough
@MichiganDNR You should probably put out a warning for poke weed as well. It has been popping up all over northern michigan. Especially is raspberry patches
@blackwaterusa01 @HillaryClinton @TheAtlantic That's because during all the corruption meuller was head of the fbi and stopped the investigations into her. And now he's going after trump for crap that him and hiilary did. It's all available. Look it up people
@nowthisnews You can't end the corruption with so many democrats involved
@WSJ And this is why kids are getting dumber and dumber.
@9and10News All because that crook hillary wasn't elected when they fought and cheated hard to get her into office. No thank you
@JesseFFerguson @ChelseaClinton You forgot murdering. Embezzling. Money laundering. Lying to congress.
@Shabbernigdo @PLW302 @nowthisnews Aaawww. Peggy blocked me.
@Shabbernigdo @PLW302 @nowthisnews Because it's a tue statement. Instead of bitching about trump she should have done something
@nowthisnews Maybe she should have done more. Like find a way to get the food and resources out that were all sitting in containers behind her. Or all the water left untouched. Typical democrat. Screw over the people then blame everyone else
@Whippenz @FLOTUS Obama was not a real man. He was a hate monger and spread racism. And now he runs around lying about his success as president and lies about trump
@nowthisnews This woman uses any excuses she can to get back into the spotlight
@oliverdarcy @FOX4 Says the man that lies about censoring people for no reason. Like Alex jones. And Brandon Straka and many others and lying about why.
@usminority Good luck. I hope everything goes well. Tell alex to keep up the good work
@nowthisnews Why. So our government can ship it in from Mexico? Just plain stupid
@usminority I heard you on Alex Jones. I hope the march goes good
@LisaAbeyta @Cernovich Well if they are murderers and rapists then i say no big loss.
@nowthisnews @BarackObama It will be fine as long as the dems don't get their way
Pope Francis Compares Vatican Whistleblower to Satan | Breitbart https://t.co/sTvzK5t1jB via @BreitbartNews @Pontifex
@Pontifex Except for you you pedophile piece of shit. You beed to be hanged
@BreitbartNews The pope should be dragged out and hanged from a power pole until his feet quit kicking
@SpeakerRyan Doubtful. The democrats wouldn't be stupid enough to pull something like that again so soon. But then again they are getting pretty desperate
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump If the dumbass governor or mayor or whatever she was did her job right and quit bitching and lying there wouldn't have been a problem. But all you democrats ever do is bitch and lie then blame someone else for your actions like a child. Stop helping destroy this country
@cypherial @nowthisnews Obviously there's something wrong with the people doing the shooting. The one in florida was investigated and the fbi and police. And were all warned about him but nothing was done. The same with most of the mass shooters.
@Jon__Cobb @RudyGiuliani I honestly don't know how you even got put into that group
@Jon__Cobb @RudyGiuliani No that wasn't supposed to be for you. It was for rudy Giuliani. Sorry for the confusion
@RudyGiuliani @Jon__Cobb So who was it that gve you the heads up to get out of the area before hand. Why not talk about that
@JoeNBC So what your saying is trump is worse than the democrats that orchestrated this tragedy. That's unlikely
@9and10News Let's see how many times it switches the votes in favor of the dems like they have been doing all over the country. Again.
@nowthisnews Yah cuz the gun was the problem. Morons
@nowthisnews They were the ones doing the harassing in the beginning. Try showing the entire video next time and not a doctored one
@realDonaldTrump He posted it because senators just tried saying obama never said anything about a magic want and that trump was a liar. Here's the proof they are lying
@ChrisMurphyCT starting at 3 minutes. https://t.co/9BrnQ2goI7
https://t.co/nPOLXZyP6p
@GlennKesslerWP @ChrisMurphyCT He did say it. I've heard the audio numerous times. Stop the lying
@ChrisMurphyCT He did say that liar.
@SenWarren We didn't have a choice on Obama care you nitwit. Which by the way cost Americans thousands more every year because of you democratic morons. So stick to something you can actually handle like tying your shoes. Hopefully
@nowthisnews How many times are you gonna run this stupid add
@nowthisnews He needs to be investigated almost as much as the Clintons. This guy is one of the most corrupt officials in office
@SenSanders And voter fraud
@jack I'm surprised you can sleep at all being such a liar and Democratic stooge blocking and removing people who don't fit the leftist destruction agenda you coward
@lenn_schaefer @KamalaHarris I'm guessing these people were Clinton supporters.
@nowthisnews Every time I've gone to the doctor I've spent 90 percent of my time with a nurse. The doctor comes in for 5 minutes with his opinion then leaves. Then the nurse is back in to do the work again.

@SenateDems @Tuesdaywithliz Just like you idiots are doing to people on social media. You guys are some of the biggest hypocrites that ever walked the face of the earth. Second only to the church
@nowthisnews This is breaking news huh. Well. Ok
@Jim_Jordan And they will never face charges of any kind for it. And neither will clinton or anyone else involved. Instead they will keep indicting people who had nothing to do with it
@nowthisnews People have been standing up to bullies like you and the dems and the rest of the corrupt idiots in government and they are getting band from social media sites you dick
@SenThomTillis That's because he's under 90 years old. There should be a term limit for these people.
@nowthisnews Thise weren't protesters. They were paid chronies. Protesters don't get paid. These people are losers
@NBCNews We should be able to lock up the fbi for lying to us for years. And for help with the russian collusion
@FoxNews @BarackObama Your a loser and a lier. You should be investigated heavily for Russian collusion along with hillary.
@GOP @nikkihaley If john McCain hadn't given money and weapons to the so called rebels along with the help of the democrats there wouldn't be any fighting over there. Leave it to the dems to start a war then blame someone else.
@nowthisnews He also didn't have democrat corruption and collusion then blaming the other party for what they are doing in mind either.
@SenSanders And paying congress and the Senate to do nothing but lie and destroy our country. They do the same thing as people on welfare. They get paid to do nothing
@BarackObama Yes vote. Save us from the corrupt democrats trying to bring down this country
@Twitter Why are you lying about people and shutting down their accounts. How much money is cnn and the dems paying kyou to play favorites on political views. https://t.co/5LLj0Glxlq

@nowthisnews They wouldn't care if he was a Democrat. Or if he was endorsed by Obama. The whole government is corrupt at the highest level
@nowthisnews Nobody wants to hear your crap.
@ktumulty @washingtonpost @SenJohnMcCain @MeghanMcCain It was great. But not because of McCain. He was a traitor
@BBCWorld Big deal. A traitor shouldn't have 3 or 4 dats of memorial services. And his traitor ex President friends are there too.
@nowthisnews She should have beat the piss out of that guy with a ball bat. And everyone blaming trump for it is just as stupid as that white supremacist.
@MSNBC He should spend the weekend taking pay away from congress.
@nowthisnews It started well before trump was in office. Our government has always used secret anti everything commities for years. That's how they have controlled things in the u.s.
@FoxNews They do too. They both rose to the position they are in because of the democrats. They gave bin laden weapons and helped him start alcida or however you spell it. Then they gave the world obama and hillary as weapons for the republicans to use. And then they want to destroy both
@nowthisnews Way to take a month old or older post and reissue it to envoke racial issues. Now this does this shit all the time.
@KaitMarieox @KentState They already approved it in the beginning. So let it happen with or without their talks
@TheBeatWithAri @MSNBC @tedlieu @AymanM What about the corrupt dems in congress. You can't talk corruption in government without including them
@nowthisnews They should have set up a food stand.
@BreitbartNews Or how about American traitor john McCain. DC.
@FoxNews So it's ok for our taxes to go to planned parenthood for abortions and then for them to turn around and donate and support the democrats but they won't allow anyone to support the republicans. The DNC can go fuck themselves
@foxandfriends What a bunch of morons. How does it violate their first amendment rights. I don't believe in god and for very good reasons but this right here is why i refuse to associate myself with an atheist title. They are just as dumb as believing in a god
@NBCNews @MSNBC I've heard that phrase on multiple occasions in place of saying fuck it up. The only people making it racist are once again blacks and democrats. Go figure
@SenSanders Yah cuz it was his fault. He's the one that left all the shipping containers of resources on the docks while the stupid mayor or governor or whatever she is bitched about not having aid that was sitting right behind her. Piss off bernie
@nowthisnews The guns aren't the problem either. It's the morons doing the killings. Every one of them were hospitalized or investigated and on anti depressants or anti psycotics. But yah let's blame guns. Dumbasses
@l0n3rw1thA8onEr @nowthisnews Not when a pistol round looks like this. Which you can buy online. And there are many many other types. Don't argue with crap you hear on the news or online https://t.co/qjafyIewA2
@l0n3rw1thA8onEr @nowthisnews Wrong. They just go faster. There are plenty of pistol rounds out there that will shred a persons body and internal organs.
@nowthisnews A semi auto pistol could have done the same damage in the same amount of time and been smuggled in easier. Stop making it sound like AR's are so damn dangerous. You can buy pistols with 16 round clips and will fire as fast as you pull the trigger.
@NYTHealth @nytimes Bullshit. The people with children affected by vaccines and ended up with rare diseases or death polarized the vaccine debate. And with very good reason. It wasn't the fucking russians you dumb pieces of shit
@nowthisnews The only mistake was them using Verizon.
@nowthisnews No Your amplifying misinformation. Maybe you assholes should do your own research before throwing up garbage news.
@FoxNews @JessicaTarlov Just like it has for so many years prior right?
@BreitbartNews They didn't before. Especially after over 16 years of lie after lie after lie from government and media.
@nowthisnews Their iphones come from china anyways. Dumbasses
@nowthisnews @MuslimIQ Yes it can. The Catholic church is the absolute largest criminal organization that has ever existed. But when Muslims commit a terrible act it's generally in the name of their religion. The religion itself promotes hatred
@nowthisnews Yah make it legal so people can avoid consequences and just keep doing it over and over until they decide to finally keep one. If your not ready to be a parent then keep your shit in your pants. That goes for men and woman.
@SenSanders Michigan isn't the hottest it's been in 5 years. 8 years ago in northern michigan it was 100+ almost every day of the summer. But keep telling everyone it's getting hotter and hotter everywhere
@washingtonpost The same could be asked about the last 4 presidents
@SenSanders Climate change is going to happen regardless of what people do. That's what happens on this planet. It has happened a number of times before we were here and it will keep happening long after we are gone.
@TheJusticeDept The IRS is as corrupt as an organization gets.
@BreitbartNews And neither do blacks.
@ABC Then he's a pussy. Plus his music is garbage
@NBCNews Check the full article. It had nothing to do with trump being able to save this place. And this is an old ass article
@washingtonpost At least bodies don't turn up when someone is going to speak against him like with the clintons. And the clintons have laundered more money than trump could ever imagine. But people still wanted her corrupt ass in the white house
@CNN The most  unpatriotic President in history. He was president for way too long. All he cared about was himself and paying off other countries
@MichiganDNR Good. It's about time they finally use their brains
@SenSanders @JustinTrudeau First of all you decrepit prick taking children from there parents at the border has been happening for years. Long before trump eas elected. And it's because if your own party. Second, we have our own problems so saudi Arabia can go fuck themselves with a camel dick
@FoxNews Pansies. These people need to grow up and focus more on their own life and families and quick whining and crying about stupid shit they see on the news. Half of it is bullshit anyhow.
@SenSanders It's not immoral. If that's the case every ceo and company owner is immoral for making more money than the lowest of their employees
@SenSanders But according to the democrats during the  elections and hillary there is no possible way to interfere with the elections or the voting in any way. But now that they lost it happened in every way possible. Keep fishing dems
@NBCNews The parents should have to undergo electroshock therapy
@SenGaryPeters Russia didn't affect the outcome so quit whining. And the U.S. intelligence agency is one of the least credible agencies in this country.
@SenSanders Pathetic. The only thing pathetic is your stupid Democratic agenda and all the crap you spew. You gave in to that bitch for a bribe during the elections. Your no better than any of them
@nowthisnews Bullshit. There's not an ounce of proof the Russians had anything to do with trump winning. All they did was make their own commercials. That's not going to influence enough people to change votes you incompetent fucks
@nowthisnews If your trying to fix relations with a country you don't condemn them for something one group did you nazi ass Hillary supporters. There's no proof russia itself was involved. People are just digging for an excuse
@FoxNews She should get the death sentence.
@FoxNews She deserves a medal. Any judge that convicts someone like that should be skinned alive.
@FoxNews @HillaryClinton Says the bitch that stole billions from hati through her corrupt foundation
@NBCNews Who gives a shit. She's an old hag. The whole monarchy thing is a complete joke
@FoxNews I wrote it the way i said it in my head...idiot
@ABC They should have done that for obama also. And bush.
@FoxNews Those poor poor way over paid idiots.
@SenGaryPeters It doesn't matter who he picks. Republican or Democrat the supreme court is as much of a joke as the senate. They care about themselves and their families or nothing else.
@SenSanders @realDonaldTrump Maybe you should read further than pfizer you dumbass. It says pfizer and others. "Others"  do you think he means walgreens. Stop spreading your crap
@nowthisnews If they did a real investigation with the past 4 presidents especially Bill and his crypt keeper wife and their foundation there would be much more indictments. But they never turn on their own. Especially when it benefits them
@nowthisnews Someone should have tossed her big ass out the window
@gigglybear1982 @NBCNews And I'm sure they are blaming trump or the nra for the gun violence. In a city with the strictest gun laws in the country.
@FoxNews It's obviously not a very good strip joint if she's working there
@NBCNews Bullshit. There is absolutely no way it costs that much a night. If so then that's even more reason to ship their asses back to where they came from
@SenSanders Tha is 100 percent what your buddy Obama did and you loved him you geriatric prick
@nowthisnews Stupid pope. His religion is flawed in numerous ways.
@FoxNews Who gives a shit. So i guess people want our imprisoned criminals to have their families with them too. So let's round up their husbands wives, and kids and let them all live together in prison so they stay together. Same thing.
@washingtonpost Boo hoo.
@FoxNews Nobody cares what kathy has to say. She's a terrible comedian and a horrible actress. She's just an attention whore
@FoxNews @POTUS Yes we do. They need to be scrutinize the hell out of them. As well as the cia. No government organization should have that much power over the people without extreme scrutiny
@NBCNews But It's ok for our government and cps to rip families apart in the U.S. when they feel like it even when there is no justification for it.
@SenSanders The bible is so screwed up you can use it for anything. The church uses it for their own gain why can't government.
@WellsFargo And away from you crooked bastards
@suehambone @FoxNews And trump owns the resort so he pays nothing to golf it.
@SenSanders How is this bad. He may be a smart and strong and good negotiator. Hitler was a piece of shit but he was smart as hell. Many dictators are very smart. They don't get where they are by being stupid like you. Shouldn't you be in a retirement home by now
@nowthisnews It's not their policy. It's been policy for years. Trump is the only one with enough balls to enforce the laws. If Obama did this people would be praising him for protecting the people of the u.s.
@MSNBC @NBCNews @Tom_Winter But they won't go after the Clinton foundation for embezzling billions of dollars. They must be getting some kind of a cut like the rest of the Democratic party
@washingtonpost After the general saluted him first. Washington post again hiding shit
@ABC Maybe the parents should use their brains and not try coming here illegally. Plus once they have been charged finally they are reunited with their kids and sent back to Mexico. So big god damn deal
@SenSanders You could save more money by following out a death row inmates sentance. And enact a law to put child molesters and rapists to death for their crimes since they aren't worth as much as the pile of shit my dog leaves. Kinda like everyone in government
@washingtonpost No obama destroyed our image. Chi a wouldn't even accept him properly at the airport. But they still do with trump. He's making the rrst of the world see that we won't take their shit anymore and give them handouts everywhere
@aminatra86 @nytimes Yah. It's as legitimate as easter. Another false religious practice
@nytimes He should skip it this year too. It's not anything important
@NBCNews It's not falsely accusing when it's true. He helped the nazis persecute thousands of jews and felt no remorse for any of it. I hate roseanne but she's right about soros
@FoxNews @HillaryClinton This isn't a democracy. Our country hasn't been a democracy for years. When the federal government ignores everything good for the people on both sides for the wants of the federal government and their own gain it's communism.
@FoxNews Round them up and send them to north korea.
@CBSNews This has to have something to do with those yuppie lets start a trend to be cool asshats
@heatherngirls12 @CBSNews The first step is to figure out male from female. Don't want to mix that one up
@upnorthlive Bullshit. He killed someone. He should either rot in prison for the rest of his worthless life or be dragged into the middle of town and hanged from a street light. This peice of garbage doesn't deserve anything better
@jimmyfallon @mindykaling @Andy @lilpump I don't know who decided to have that douchebag lilpump on but they need to be beat with a horse dildo. That thing couldn't sing to save his life
@FoxNews @Caitlyn_Jenner It's a guy. Quit calling it a she
@NBCNews @NBCLatino Bullshit. They are throwing the parents in jail for breaking the law and the kids have to wait. Once the parents get out and set to be deported the kids are back with them. If they want to be here they can do it thr right way
@NBCNews Bullshit. It was illegal to shoot sows with cubs especially in a den before Obama was President and it will be long after trump is out. Hunting any animal falls with the states laws not the president
@FoxNews Hell no they weren't. Those people were terrorists. They should have been slowly deep frying them in oil until they started spilling their guts with information
@upnorthlive The only good I've heard about it so far
@MSNBC They were fucking terrorists. They killed god knows how many men. Raped and killed woman and children for fun. Waterboarding is the least of what i would have done.
@VolvoCarUSA Just what we need. Another overpriced car that costs a fortune to fix any plastic parts on it. I wouldn't buy one of these damn things for a nickle. Car companies need to make real cars again and not this crap
@NBCNews You can't trust or believe anything to do with the whole of the government anyways so that's kind of a stupid ass question
@CBSNews Who cares. I don't give a shit if he screwed a whole bus load of porn stars while eating a hotdog and wearing a clown costume and singing the national anthem.
@NBCNews And the democrats are owned by george soros and the coke brothers.
@boyscouts This is dumb as hell. Now even the boy scouts are trying to conforn to this stupid anti gender garbage. Way to ruin your organization
@CBSNews They don't. Most of it is used to overpay our stupid government officials that 90% of the time don't do anything worth paying them for.
@FoxNews @Franklin_Graham Prayer and god have nothing to do with running a country. Religion doesn't make a person good, just look at all the child molesting priests and the cover ups throughout the Vatican.
@nowthisnews Looks like another douche bag. He should get a real job and stop making this so called music
@AMHQ @weatherchannel Mount pleasant hasn't got shit. Come north an hour or so. We have a few inches from last night. And it's almost blizzard conditions
@MSNBC That's partof being commander and cheif of the armed forces. He doesn't need permission from congress when it comes to military use. That power comes with being President
@nowthisnews That's all because the war in Iraq had nothing to do with chemical weapons. That was just the excuse ussd to remove Saddam and destabilize the area. They already knew there were no chemical weapons
@9and10News It's called the state and federal government
@9and10News Good. It's about time.
@ABC When it comes to our federal government there is no such thing as an honest investigation. They only do shit to cover up other shit
@nowthisnews So they are excited about launching a rover to do all this which is exactly like the one they launched a few years back that was dropped the same way and is doing the same exact thing.
@milocal32 @dmlyden9and10 I'd pay a lot of money to have a few hours in a room alone with him. I would get the information they need
@nowthisnews If the vaccines work so god damn well then how is it these diseases are making a comeback. If one child is vaccinated from the measles then what the fuck difference does it make if his or her classmate isn't. If the vaccine works your kid SHOULD be safe. So apparently they're not
@FoxNews Good luck taking them from the ones that already own them. You want to push for a civil war , that's the way to do it
@FoxNews He should stash his holier than thou attitude and see that it was Obama that started the whole racial divide bullshit
@FoxNews @TheJusticeDept There's so much corruption it's taking them forever to cover it up
@nytimes Sounds like our own government. Take whatever they want and will loan you only what you need
@MSNBC Aside from the fact that voting districts were reporting people voting under false names. And dead names. Also videos people recorded showing them voting one way and the machines switching it to Hillary. The illegals voting. But no there was absolutely no voter fraud
@FoxNews @HillaryClinton What the hell does this bitch know about truth and facts. She's done nothing but lie for years
@FoxNews @robertjeffress @FoxFriendsFirst No it doesn't. It's just another stolen belief from a religion that the Christians tried to eradicate
@nytimes He's a whiny little bitch
@CNN He's upset about that but won't say shit about the millions that never made it there due to the clinton foundation keeping over half the donations.
@nytimes Why. The government is making everyone go to new federal ID standards to prove we are U.S citizens. You have to provide a birth certificate or government issued passport for your new ID but asking on a census is bad. Get your heads out of your asses
@CNN Who gives a shit who he use to sleep with. More useless news stories.
@NBCNews Screw her. Another democratic puppet
@Travelgirl1024 @washingtonpost What is there to defend. He called another leader and congratulated them for winning. Just like every other President has done. Big god damn deal
@BreitbartNews Leave it to California to lead the country in stupidity. First going against immigration laws. Then electing an undocumented immigrant to office and now this garbage. We should trade that state for a pig then shoot the pig
@washingtonpost The only trolls are the ones who keep calling everyone trolls. Because they lack the IQ to have a legitimate argument when someone says something they don't like.
@washingtonpost Who fucking cares. There's actual proof out there that hillary and the Clinton foundation have been involved in actual crimes. Ben Carson spending thousands of tax payer dollars and not getting fired. And more. But we have to hear this garbage that is leading nowhere
@NBCNews That woman looks like a skeksis from the dark crystal. I bet she's stealing souls in her off time
@CNN Who gives a shit. Anyone who is stuck on this crap is an idiot. Deal with some real news you Nazi looking asshat
@FoxNews @IngrahamAngle We could say the same thing about the Clintons and half of congress
@NBCNews He should worry more about the pedo priests that he has helped hide and protect
@washingtonpost Who cares what he said. He has a right to speak his mind just like this ignorant girl
@nowthisnews Oh ok. So it's a big deal because they are trump supporters. If they supported democrats in some way or god forbid Hillary you wouldn't post this shit. Just like with antifa. You didn't give a shit about them when they were destroying things
@FoxNews So one kid gets suspended for staying in school to learn like he should while the others get to walk out and protest shit they know nothing about. All the other kids should be suspended instead
@FoxNews @KamalaHarris Hell no. We need better border protection. If we can't build a wall then put in turrets to start shooting at anyone trying to cross. Or a mine field.
@FoxNews He's been a douche bag for years. This doesn't surprise me
@CBSNews They should be expelled instead
@9and10News @AaronParseghian They all need to be expelled.
@WSJ Good. That's what they get.
@nytopinion Yep they will make the change. Ban guns and let the criminals kill their kids with guns. Way to go losers
@CNN Obviously the other 699 have more brains than him.
@washingtonpost Or how about you quit trying to help push this bullshit anti gun protesting
@FoxNews Little douchebags
@CNN He can vote all he wants. This little asshole should do some studies. Then he'd realize no gun law is going to stop a criminal from doing what they want.
@MSNBC Expel them. Take all they're credits and make them start over.
@upnorthlive I'd suspend every one of them and hold them back a year
@alyssa_zaccaro @PTalkingraven @washingtonpost I don't care about democrats or republicans. There's good and bad on both sides. I'm just tired of these anti trump idiots calling everyone a bit because they lack the intelligence to carry out a real discussion.
@MSNBC @fred_guttenberg No they're not. They are just pushing an agenda they know nothing about.
@alyssa_zaccaro @PTalkingraven @washingtonpost I love how everyone that goes against democrats or against the anti trump idiots is a not. Just an easy way for them to argue without intelligence
@FoxNews Then this guy obviously had zero training or he was screwing around with it. A gun doesn't just go off for no reason. And being in class he shouldn't have a round in the chamber anyhow.
@washingtonpost Anyone peddling anything more than pot should get the death penalty. They are a waste of human life. But we need to start putting a bunch of the criminals to death that we already have in prison first
@FoxNews She must've been on some pretty heavy drugs to think god was real.
@MSNBC Best case is they wait for kim to enter a building and then blow it to he'll with 10 bunker busters
@FoxNews Because the majority of them are lazy little shits
@WSJ They are onlt doing it because the kids are impressionable and they are trying to put them against guns as early as possible. If the parents were smart they'd file a lawsuit
@ABC Dumb bitch
@nowthisnews Sounds to me like the side effects are good for everyone. If the females are not laying as many eggs or drinking as much blood then it's a plus
@LGE__HENRY Already guiding them down the wrong path. Wells Fargo is the last company i would trust to teach anything
@ABC Change my boxers
@nytimes That will be as exciting as getting teeth pulled while getting a vasectomy
@FoxNews Wrong. Our government is a terrorist organization.
@nowthisnews Well if we would put some of them losers to death like they deserve we wouldn't have that problem. Murderers, rapists and child molesters should just be drug out back and drowned. That would clear up a lot of space
@ABC Why is our government so damn stupid that we can't classify these assholes as domestic terrorists. Anyone involved in white supremacy or kkk or any such group is a worthless piece of human waste
@Pontifex Your an ass and should be in prisons for helping to hide pedophiles
@nowthisnews God has no place in school or government.
@nowthisnews God I hope not.  He's a shit actor and a worthless human being
@FoxNews These people are dumb as shit. They should have their foreheads tattooed
@nowthisnews That's because they are stupid and still think the NRA is at fault for shootings. It's like blaming a car company for someone drinking and driving
@ABC It's because people are stupid and still believe it's a gun issue.
@WellsFargo @GoElectricInc @globalgreen It's amazing. You open fake accounts for money. Now your closing accounts to save your ass and I'm not allowed to pull my own money out. You guys need to be shut down.
@nytimes Can you say setup. Seems pretty convenient considering the recent situations
@FoxNews @BarbraStreisand @HillaryClinton She's right. Voting machines were tampered with. But she has it backwards. There was actual proof they were tampered with in Hillary's favor.
@NBCNews Awesome. I don't believe in god or even like the whole organized religion thing but these guys are great
@GMA @GStephanopoulos I wasn't aware i gave a shit what you thought.
@CNN He's not doing it for the kids. He's doing it to save his ass and the stores reputation.
@GMA @GStephanopoulos Never shopped there anyhow. It was nothing but a yuppy outdoor store
@NBCNews That governor probably talked to one teacher
@SenSanders Which basically happened every single time a Democrat was in charge.
@WSJ It's only been a controversy for other countries that don't do it themselves. It's part of a culture. They may be pets here but they are good there. Just like guinea pigs in south America. They are a menu item
@FoxNews @Theonlyhonest So now they are finding new excuses on why they started this shit. They start to get called out then make up another story to protect themselves and their leaders Hillary and Obama.
@ReaganBattalion @Cernovich @ScottJIsrael Lying little bitch
@FoxNews @TomFitton You did know a year ago you stupid asshat. But Hillary had all you morons in her pocket
@FoxNews He and Hillary laundered enough money through the Clinton foundation he should pay for it himself. All he ever did was turn this country against itself by pushing the racial divide as far as he could and costing millions of people their money.
@FoxNews @Eminem @realDonaldTrump Your a loser and no one cares what comes out of your mouth
@CNN It's easy getting numbers like that when they poll the people they want to get the results they want
@ABC All companies that already have a semi bad rap so who gives a shit
@FoxNews Uh oh. We should star a petition to ban full auto assault knives now.
@9and10News 90 percent of these morons don't even know what an assault rifle is. These school shootings are not gun problems. They are kid problems.
@FoxNews @NancyPelosi That way it'll be easier for her to see and pick up her new voters
@ABC And he should. I'd also set them all back a year for their stupid and lack of knowledge
@ABC So anyone that says school security isn't the answer they have no clue and are just gun haters
@ABC He's 100 percent right. How many schools in the country use metal detectors to protect the schools. And a large number use lockdown procedures during school hours. Numerous schools in michigan use a lockdown system and private class lockdown at the same time.
@washingtonpost That's because anyone that supports trump is automatically labeled a bit because the other side doesn't want to deal with real arguments
@FoxNews @POTUS @FBI Another stupid school kid that thinks he knows how shit works. He should get an education before trying to act like he knows anything
@CNN Where have these self entitled little brats every other day when kids and adults are killed on a daily basis by gang violence. They never gave two shits about guns until it involved them. Fuck the rest of the country as long as it doesn't involve them.
@RepTedDeutch @Emma4Change She's just going to turn into another sjw and run her mouth about shit she knows nothing about
@nowthisnews She's an idiot for thinking it would have to be locked in a closet. That would make absolutely no sense.
@ABC I hope they like that little slap in the face. The ban won't change a fucking thing and the sooner these idiot kids and their parents realize that the better
@CBSNews @biannagolodryga There's no such thing as a damn assault rifle. That term is all thanks to democrats and that zombie bitch Nancy the crypt keeper Pelosi
@nowthisnews I knew he was an idiot but I didn't realize how big of an idiot
@CBSNews @adrianasdiaz These kids are all stupid. And so are the parents supporting them
@CNN Good.
@CNN He has every right to do so. The rifle is not the problem. If those kids were shot with a pistol people would still be bitching about assault rifles. Which by the way do not exist. There is no such thing. It's a hunting rifle with black composite stock. Nothing more
@NBCNews It's because they are assholes. It's not a gun issue it's a people issue. You can take guns all you want. People are still going to kill because that's what they want to do
@FoxNews More hate mongering by kids that were probably raised to believe everything they do is special
@CNN Fund the killers then. It's obviously the kids that are the problem not the guns
@BotHead420 @SimoneHarris724 @EdwardS74895320 @CNN I love it when someone doesn't agree with you your automatically a bot. It's easier for these coddled idiots to make shit up than deal with the truth
@NBCNews Idiots. They cry when it happens to them. But you didn't hear a word from them when it happened to other schools. And it seems like it's not a gun issue it's a kid issue. We didn't have this shit when i was a kid in school. It's these new age brats
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Why would he when he is involved with the Clinton's and the coke brothers.
@NBCNews I wish they were laying in fire ants
@washingtonpost Dumb little brat. She needs to spend a little time out in the real world before she tries doing something she knows nothing about
@CNN She needs to be educated a little more before she runs her mouth. Even the FBI said they dropped the ball on this one by not doing their full job. This little girl needs to work on something she's capable of arguing
@NBCNews @nbcbayarea Oh boo hoo. And it's not a fucking assault rifle. There's no such thing as an assault rifle. I can guarantee if they put a 223 up for auction with a wood stock nobody would say a word
@ABC  https://t.co/7l9ek7xbdl
@charliekirk11 Exactly. Banning a so called military grade weapon won't stop anything. And anyone that thinks its a military grade weapon has no understanding of firearms
@FoxNews Good
@Rambobiggs The villain.
@nytimes Only because they are being pushed and lied to by their parents
@washingtonpost  https://t.co/9n8tmUPEQR
@NBCNews These kids have no clue what classifies as an assault rifle.
@TheRealJHaynes @CNN You people are stupid. It's not an assault rifle. You should do some research on what they consider an assault rifle. If i show my semi auto 22 to them with a wood stock it's a hunting rifle. If i put that same rifle on a black composite stock they say it's an assault rifle
@CNN Good. She needs to be taken into custody and held as a political prisoner for supporting a man and regime that tortures and kills it's own people
@FoxNews I love that all these butt hurt leftists and Hillary lovers think this made a difference whatsoever.
@FoxNews It wouldn't have made a difference. They had social media accounts and rallies. Even if they didn't it would not have made a difference. You people need to be more concerned with the way our own democrats and government officials are treating the people. And the lies they tell
@CNN He's an idiot. Gun control will do nothing. The sooner people realize that the better. It has nothing to do with gun control. Even if all weapons were banned he still would have gotten them if he wanted too
@FoxNews What a joke. It wasn't Russia that got trump elected. It was the mistrust of the democrats and our government. And even if Russia did meddle in it who cares. How many leaders has our country removed and put into power for our own special interest
@CNN What a load of garbage. I wonder how much they or their families got for them to go on there and blame someone else. SJW´s in the making. Quit blaming the NRA or the government every time some jackass shoots some place up. It is the individual to blame.
@CNN You would think the uber driver would be smart enough to alert someone when dropping off a kid at school with a gun or gun case
@nowthisnews I got my son use to the noise. And he wears earmuffs.
@CNN He obviously knows nothing about guns.
@CNN There is not one thing he can do that will stop school shootings short of banning all guns. And even that will not stop it
@BarackObama Stuff it up your ass. There are no gun laws that are going to stop this shit from happening. People need to pull their heads out of their assets and realize that. If you want to stop this shit then put guards in schools. Or allow the teachers to carry.
@SenSanders They will say we finally upheld a law in this country
@nowthisnews People are fucking stupid if they think more gun control will do anything. People will still get the guns. And people that want to do harm will find a way no matter what.
@CNN If he's been here 40 years he's had plenty of time to become a legal citizen. There are no excuses. We have laws in this country for a reason.
@FoxNews @dbongino They are acting like they didn't already know this shit. Or that Hillary is and always will be a crook
@nowthisnews I bet if we put a scratch and sniff sticker at the bottom of a pool she would be dumb enough to try and smell it
@CNN Eat shit Joe. You and Obama divided this country from day one you piece of garbage
@NBCNews There's video evidence of planned parenthood reps talking about selling parts and about the babies being alive when they take them out and none of the people in the video were prosecuted or investigated any further.
@nowthisnews Good. It's nobodies business who won the money
@nowthisnews Anyone that believes the flu shots are good for you should have their head examined. I haven't had one in over 20 years and have not had the flu. But these faith people are even dumber.
@RealKyleMorris The only thing he'll be touching now is his toes
@ABC Nope. Treason is what the democrats and hillary have been doing for years
@nowthisnews Yes it is. That's why Hillary and her government lackeys in congress along with Obama should all be shot by a firing squad. And I'm guessing that means you too jeffries
@SenSanders Yah because that's what he said you geriatric prick. Your as bad as the media. Misconstrueing everything he says.
@nowthisnews Moore is a worthless sacj of crap. The system that gave is trump was a democratic anti American agenda full of lies and corruption. So the people spoke and chose a better option
@WellsFargo @cornbread_henry I want to know why I'm going to end up having to get a lawyer to get my money out of my 401k with wells Fargo but any other company all I have to do is call and get it. Talk about corrupt. They are basically holding MY money hostage
@FoxNews @TuckerCarlson For the first time huh. Americans have known that for years. The federal government at every level is corrupt. They have never been a system for the people.
@CNN @BillKristol Our entire government is treasonous. They act only for themselves while breaking the laws they vote for. They should all be investigated to the fullest extent to weed out the corrupt
@SenSanders We already paid the highest in the world before Obama care. Then even higher with Obama care. So stuff your democrat healthcare up your ass bernie
@GMA It's a good thing the government and pharmaceutical companies were able to lie and tell people the shots were good and would help so much. And we now have a record outbreak of the flu. And probably not a coincidence. Since they still know there are toxic chemicals in them
@9and10News Oh no. Gotta get them bad drugs off the street. Dumbasses
@BBCWorld Wonderful. Now these stupid fools running around in skinny jeans are eventually going to start wearing makeup too. It's bad enough these boys are being raised as sissies. In another 40 to 60 years there won't be any real men left.
@washingtonpost Wrong. The president, no matter who it is, is the only one with full power to say push the button.
@FoxNews @JessicaTarlov @POTUS And it was clear from the beginning that they had no intention of doing an actual investigation with queen Hillary or king Obama.
@FoxNews @LukasMikelionis Riiiiiiiight. Since when does knowledge of celebrities and movies or music count as intelligence.
@washingtonpost People like him are his as bad as the Nazis. Or the democrats
@CNN Who cares. They didn't want her anyhow. And he is one of the worst players that ever stepped foot on the field.
@FoxNews Whoopty Fricken doo. This bitch is famous for absolutely no reason so quit reporting on her and her worthless family
@nytimes What violence. These overpaid idiots slow down before they hit someone because they are sissies and make too much money to be violent. Collage players hit harder than these morons
@FoxNews Shut down the school completely if it's going to follow thise ridiculous guidelines
@CNN Fuck her. No one cares what she thinks. Once she stopped being an actress and started working on that brainless talk show with the other half minded nitwits she just got stupid
@nowthisnews Does anyone even pay attention to the stupid rotten tomato score.
@CNN The whole of government undermines our rule of law on a daily basis.
@CNN He would run hard then at the right moment drop out for the right amount of money again
@FoxNews She should be given a raise and promotion.
@FoxNews @IngrahamAngle Gee. Who would have thought. It's only been proven time and time again but falsified since day one. But that's what you get when you have major news networks taking orders from the elite
@CNN Why not just give them the keys to the front door too. It's prison not a damn retreat. Most of them shouldn't even be alive still
@FoxNews And all this garbage started with stupid Obama and his push at racial divide. Then people took it further and started this whole pc bullshit. Everything done or said nowadays offends someone so they cry until it's news
@SenSanders And it started with both democrats and republicans years ago because most of them get money from the healthcare systems. Both hospitals and pharmaceutical companies.
@TODAYshow Screw the super bowl.
@cnnbrk I can go buy armor piercing rounds anywhere I buy a gun. The fact he used armor piercing rounds doesn't make a difference. He could have killed just as many with regular hunting rounds
@FoxNews @NancyPelosi Screw that horse faced bitch. She looks like the crypt keeper
@SenSanders Of course the fbi would say that you asshole.  Its against them partly. That's why you and the other democrats are whining about it being released because it shows your true sides
@ABC This cops should have hesitated for at least 2 or 3 seconds so he could have reached his worthless ass
@NewDay @CNN There has to be something good on it or democrats wouldn't have voted against it's release and the fbi and justice department wouldn't be trying to talk them out of releasing it
@realDonaldTrump No just less democrats
@FoxNews @POTUS There should be a parental advisory for her face and her stupidity
@FoxNews @MaxineWaters @realDonaldTrump Says a black racist
@ABC He must be a special forces bird. Sneaking in under the radar
@WSJ Funny. They ran hundreds of ads on how the flu vaccine was safer than ever for seniors to babies and pushed vaccines like crazy. The following flu season the cases have skyrocketed. It's a good thing everyone got vaccinated so they wouldn't get the flu
@CNN It's because college kids nowadays are easily swayed. And a lot of them are whiny little brats.
@ABC They throw racism in on everything to make trump look like a racist. He is racist for being President because he lives in the "White" house. And damn him for not changing it to the black or hispanic house.
@nowthisnews Yah because the department of justice and fbi are infallible and can't be touched even when there's proof of wrongdoing. He must've been a huge Clinton fan.
@nowthisnews They are illegals. Who cares. They can find a legal way or they can stay home. And the moron in the video had 30 years to become a citizen. No excuses there.
@ABC This country lost a lot of it's respect due to Bush, Clinton and Obama. They fucked up this country and made us look like sissies to the rest of the world.
@nowthisnews This site is just reposting a lie they told shortly after the speech. He was clapping for each of the hero's brought in. But if you didn't watch then you would believe this garbage
@FoxNews That's going to be as dumb as religion itself
@nowthisnews I'm so sick of these protesting assholes. We should stuff all of them and those peta asshole and stuff them in a bag then toss them in a river
@ABC Good. Get a dog or god forbid a cat. These people that try to use these exotic pets as emotional support animals and expect every business to bow to them for it should just step in front of a bus
@nowthisnews The lies I'm seeing keep coming from now this news. Must be a Pelosi run news center
@CNN Wow is he dumb. He's right though. They are targeting laws that protect us. By actually trying to enforce them. Unlike him and the Nazi democrats
@nowthisnews Liars. He was clapping for the people in the audience that were brought there. If your just gonna throw out lies then go work for cnn
@FoxNews @CNN @realDonaldTrump Nobody gives a shut what this asshole thinks.
@FoxNews @chuckschumer Round them up while they are all in one place and ship them all to Mexico
@peta @CanadaGooseInc You don't kill geese for their coats. They don't wear coats. You kill them for the meat.
@nowthisnews This guy is an idiot. And anyone upset about our President talking and acting like a real human being instead of an over paid politition can pack your crap and head to those shithole countries. Then you'll really have something to bitch about
@FoxNews @ConanOBrien @realDonaldTrump Good. He's not funny in any way. He's one of the worst talk show host's that ever lived
@peta You only give them garlic and onions in the crock pot
@nowthisnews It's only racist to people who keep pushing the racist card. It was a fucking add and people need to pull their big kid panties up and get over it
@FoxNews @BarackObama Obama worked for 8 years and the economy never changed this much. He had nothing to do with it
@FoxNews Who cares. He's a shitty actor. Hillary is the real enemy of mankind. She proved that with benghazy and haiti
@MrsScottBaio A crook joining a slu of crooks. Sounds right
@FoxNews @WattersWorld These kids nowadays are big ass pansies. What's gonna happen when these sissies get to the real world and aren't allowed to have a damn animal every time they get stressed out at a job.
@NBCNews He's 100% right. They are definitely shithole countries.
@CNN But all these assholes celebrated as Obama did everything he could to split this country with his race baiting.
@9and10News We could save a lot of money if the morons in the senate weren't getting paid so damn much to sit around and do nothing for this state.
@ABC It's only a firestorm for people with no lives that thrive on looking for something to bitch about. So screw them
@nowthisnews Who gives a fuck. They are shithole countries
@NBCNews That is awesome
@nowthisnews There's at least 2 countries where you can buy it from a cheese maker. It's not illegal throughout all of Europe
@FoxFriendsFirst @KatrinaPierson It was only investigated until someone put a stop to it because they wanted Hillary to be President. That birch should be locked in a prison with no windows and fed dog food until the day she dies
@CBSNews @CBSThisMorning Any woman that would support Weinstein has no reason to run for president. You might as well vote for Hillary
@nowthisnews Jake tapper is a huge douche and always has been
@SenGaryPeters They are kids. It should be against the law to even charge for healthcare for children until they hit a certain age. But government needs their money wherever they can get it from
@FoxNews One more step back for this country
@SenSanders Very clear. Build the damn wall
@nowthisnews And that's part of the problem with this country. Other countries kids grow up with art like that their whole lives and it doesn't affect them. He gets fired but people are allowed to raise children in nudist colonies.
@FoxNews @POTUS Those numbers are easy to get when you only poll leftwing democrats
@FoxNews Good. You shouldn't be denied services because someone worships a fairy tale.
@nowthisnews By who, the democrats? Even the democratic committee is sick of Hillary. If she was so admired then how did she lose the election. More false news.
@washingtonpost Your throats are use to having things rammed down them
@nowthisnews Then she should stop doing music. If she gives up because stupid people are whining about israel then she is as much of a loser as them
@nytimes It just shows that even he is smart enough not to give a shit about these people.
@nytimes Good
@nowthisnews And if it were the trumps people would be ready to hang them in the streets. But of course the Obamas get away with everything. Just like the clintons
@FoxNews No no. Him as Batman was a national tragedy. The only one worse than him was ben no talent aflack
@FoxNews Very true. The Democratic party is full of the biggest criminals in the world. The two biggest. Bill and Hillary. But everything they have done gets swept under the rug and never talked about.
@NBCNews I bet this idiot is still a bill clinton supporter too. A real sexual predator.
@nowthisnews No. He is mocking the leftist idiots who believe the democratic lies that have been pushed into their heads for so many years of moronic U.S destroying presidents. We finally have a President willing to say what needs to be said and it's making the whiners whine even more
@nowthisnews It this was the other way around you guys wouldn't report on it. It happens the other way around every day but because they are trump supporters it has to be reported like all trump supporters are like that.
@nytimes Sorry. Technically dead.
@nytimes People need to realize that a DNR is only legally binding until your heart stops. Once you are tech2dead it is void and the doctors can then resuscitate
@Cernovich No because they never attacked him. They were told to be nice to him and hillary
@NBCNews He's such a loser. And he was a terrible football player. Which is another reason no team would sign him. Worthless pos
@nowthisnews Screw the federal court. It's not unconstitutional. If you can pat for drugs you shouldn't get government money. That's tax payer money. If you can afford to buy and take drugs you shouldn't get tax payer handouts
@FoxNews This is why some species eat their young.
@FoxNews I hope he loses the entire business for being such a bigoted asshole.
@nowthisnews Just another idiot looking for some kind of attention
@FoxNews @RepMattGaetz @HillaryClinton Well no shit. Everyone in the country knew that one.
@FoxNews @dbongino Very very true
@nowthisnews Don't care. No one else should either except for those two. Other than them it's a waste of human existence to give a shit what these people and other so called celebrities are up to
@FoxNews @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump No we had a temporary absence in leadership for 8 years with your worthless ass
@SenSanders Shut up Bernie. If you were President you'd be fucking this country up but you gave in to your buddy hillary
@Rambobiggs Another loser football player.
@FoxNews @POTUS Fuck the protesters. They have no real clue what they are even protesting and even less of a clue how wrong they are about the shit thet are protesting against
@ABC Well no shit. That's all it's ever done. All they ever care about is themselves and how much money they can make
@washingtonpost This is a joke. He didn't lie. They are on a witch hunt and broke him down financially. And broke his family down. And the white house lawyers ducked him as the last straw to a worn out innocent man
@FoxNews @jimmykimmel Jimmy Kimmel is a joke. He's not funny and never has been and nothing but a leftist lackey for the Democratic dipshits
@CNN He wasn't worth a shit and nowhere in the same class as Ali. Sports illustrated just turned themselves into a joke.
@jondutoit They are only refuted if you use the bible for research. It's a proven fact that the stories in the bible are taken from religions that existed before christianity. As well as the holidays and Jesus.
@jondutoit That's funny because there is well known proof Constantine existed but none whatsoever that Jesus existed other than the bible. And Constantine ruled after your supposed Jesus. But christianity was founded centuries before the story of Jesus. So maybe you should do some research
@jondutoit The church has been behind the take over of other nations since then to push their own agendas. That's why Ireland and other countries were pushed into christianity. They were a major pagan belief until the church came in and forced them into christianity
@jondutoit Christianty was created when paganism was the main religion in the world. It was created because one man found the rituals disgusting. So he created his own religion using stories from pagon gods and the holidays to make it more appealing. He then amassed a large following
@jondutoit Once he had enough people they attacked the pagans giving them a choice to follow or die. And since then Christianity has done the same throughout the world for centuries. Using other gods and holidays for their own false books to make christianity more appealing
@jondutoit First of all get your facts straight. It has nothing to do with the Israelites. The church took over areas just like a military force. That's what the crusades were all about. But even further back than than the Christian religion was being used for war and a push for conformity
@jondutoit Everything in the bible is taken from other beliefs. They did it that way when they took over areas so they could make it easier for people to conform to christianity.
@nowthisnews He has a point and you people are too stupid to realize it. Most states only allow Indians to have casinos and get government money. He's not racist he's telling the truth
@FoxNews @POTUS So for months fox says trump is pushing us towards nuclear war and should be removed from office but now they want us to bomb a missile site in north Korea. And if we do destroy it and it starts a war fox and all the trump haters will go nuts blaming trump. Your all stupid
@nowthisnews Right in front of trump. Give me a break. He wasn't doing it to poke at the President. You people need to quit listening to the democrat media. This is the same media that sticks up for the Clinton's at every turn
@ABC Why does anyone give a damn what these people are doing. It's disgusting how people live their lives caring what is going on with the stupid royal family or actors and actresses.
@CNN Who gives a shit. Screw the royal family.
@cnnbrk Intellectual property. Which means it had nothing to do with government. I've seen street signs with more intelligence than our government
@washingtonpost All of those ridiculous moron rappers did. It amazes me they call that music.
@CNN Fire the judge and replace him with one that cares about the country.
@nowthisnews It was run through the Clinton foundation and supported by bush and Obama. Which means it was just a scam to make millions off of the people. If government wants people to have and be able to afford healthcare they should make it so companies have a limit on what they can charge
@washingtonpost Good. People that have dogs and just leave them chained up outside day and night should be fined and jailed. If your not going to bring your dog in and just keep them chained up you don't deserve to have them.
@CNN Fucking liar. If it wasn't for trump all those losers would be sitting in jail still. China doesn't fuck around when it comes to crime.
@CNN Just another way for the left to push the acceptance of Muslim ideals. But won't mention that the hijab isn't worn by real choice. Woman and young girls are beaten, torchured and killed if it is not worn or it slips off. So way to go Mattel for supporting sharia law.
@CBSNews @MajorCBS And yet none can provide evidence of any kind. Just like with the Russian collusion
@CBSNews A lot of bullshit flying around this post. With all Franken there is proof. With Moore there is none and when they ask for some the people refuse to speak. And the shit about trump was a lie so democrats could try to demonize him
@nowthisnews The truck owner must be upset because Hillary wasn't elected so now gim and his family can't get free government money anymore fucking loser
@FoxNews It's about time we have a president with balls enough to start calling all these people out.
@FoxNews @KarlRove @POTUS Bull. The democrat states voted democrat. What a shock. Just like they did when they voted for crooked hillary.
@nowthisnews More bullshit. First it's bad then it's good and now It's bad again. These idiots waste more money on so called studies than congress does on personal trips
@Rambobiggs @HuffPostPol Good. All churches should pay taxes. The Catholic church rakes in so much money in a year it's ridiculous. They are nothing more than a franchise for the Vatican
@FoxNews They were drunk when it happened so what does pot have to do with it. Someone trying to push their agenda again I'm guessing
@FoxNews Good. Now that we know where they are start loading the busses and ship them out.
@nowthisnews It's called diplomacy you asshats. You don't visit a country and call them all thieves. This post is as dumb as @nowthisnews.
@NBCNews It's not an anti trump protest. It's an anti u.s protest. These people hate the U.S because of their President and because of obama for criticism against their President for killing drug dealers and makers with no trials.
@nowthisnews Wow people need to settle down. If you seriously think this is going to get people killed your fucking stupid. It's not like they are handing out guns at the door to kids. It's a parent picking up a child and leaving. You people are so damn clueless about guns
@BBCWorld And now the democrats won't have enough money to pay their boss Hillary.
@FoxNews @RepAdamSchiff No we just got rid of the worst one last year.
@nytimes This is why every state should have a mandatory death sentence. Start putting these asshats to in the grave will make people start thinking
@CNN It's easy to get numbers like that when you only pole democratic trump haters that are still whining and crying that crooked hillary still wasn't able to win even after all the cheating
@NBCNews He's still a douche bag. We have him to thank for the huge racial divide
@PrisonPlanet Wow is she dumb. She's two brain cells away from licking her butt and chasing cars. And ungly as rotten road kill
@nowthisnews This is a lie. Texas crimes dropped when everyone was allowed to carry. Chicago went the other way and crime skyrocketed
@nowthisnews Cps is a joke. 90% of the time all they do is fuck people. And the federal government can kill people and traffick guns and uranium but have to fuck with people for stupid shit like this
@SenSanders Our government has been involved in more senseless slaughter than any mass shootings
@nowthisnews He should have changed it to captain douche bag. He's an arrogant piece of shit
@FoxNews Anyone that thinks banning guns or the so called assault rifles is the solution then your an idiot. That won't stop shit.
@FoxNews This is funny. Everyone bitches that trump made new York political and that's exactly what happens with this one from everyone else.
@HarmlessYardDog My god is that funny. The stupid part though if that was a white cop and a black girl there would be riots for two weeks.
@ABC He's tried a million times and the democrats sgut down everything he tries that will actually help the people because they will lose money
@CNN @brianstelter Pro truth my ass. If that was the case they'd be more focused on the democrats and Hillary's collusion and treason to our country and people
@NBCNews So fucking what. And he's not African American he's black. I'm white. I don't call myself an Irish American because of my ancestors
@nowthisnews Same old leftist agenda propaganda
@washingtonpost More media lies. It's funny that not trump supporters still whine about not having a treasonous democratic in office
@Rambobiggs It's amazing how easy it is to get a bunch of losers to all show up and the same time to protest shit they know nothing about
@FoxNews Another democratic run hate group wanting to start shit. But i guarantee they will puss out because that's all they are.
@CNN The real problem is the U.S. government has no clue where the lines are with their authority. They are supposed to work for us
This is stupid. This includes Michigan. You have to prove your a U.S citizen. More government shit. https://t.co/ntMJtfsj5X
@nowthisnews I saw worse ads that that from local people. People still think trump is treasonous. Dumb democratic Hillary whiners
@washingtonpost He's as much of a crook as Hillary and the dnc
@nowthisnews What a joke. Just like her profession. The only President in years that is for the people and they do what they can to eliminate him
@FoxNews @jessebwatters @POTUS They lost the Whitehouse so now they are trying to bring down the country for their own interests.
@washingtonpost @paulwaldman1 And democrats. The democrats are the ones causing racial divide and political division
@mifox32news That show sucks. Just watch the Orville afterwards
@NBCNews And gun fire from one of them at another hotel at the time of the shooting. Survivors with evidence are mysteriously dying but not on news
@NBCNews Who cares. Explain why there were private security choppers with no transponders on at the hotel minutes before the shooting.
@FoxNews @brookefoxnews Russia didn't hack them. More excuses from criminals.They won't allow investigators to see any file in the system. They are hiding something
@FoxNews @DLoesch Dana is 100 percent right. The vetting should be stronger and stop letting people just waltz in whenever they want. All thanks to obama
@CNN The guy should be executed. He doesn't deserve a trial. We shouldn't be letting everyone in whenever they want. They need to be checked
@FoxNews @SenateMajLdr Screw religion. In 800 years Jesus will be in the mythology section where he belongs right next to all the past gods.
@ABC Its a miniature version of the Clinton foundation. They withheld millions from Haiti
@nowthisnews With the help of fox news and cnn. But it's trumps fault these people are white supremacists. And i suppose he's to blame for BLM too.
@nowthisnews It's funny morons blame trump when it was Obama that started the racial divide and not trump. The DNC and Obama started the lies about trump
@FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC The guy is a terrorist. He doesn't deserve Miranda rights or lawyer or fair trial. He did it and was caught. Hang him high in the streets
@NBCNews Obama divided America not trump. Obama is the reason these assholes are here committing terror. Schumer can eat dick
@BarackObama Fuck you and your bullshit health coverage. You were a price of shit in office and still are. You should be blamed for the new york terror
@CNN Fox has always been her network and now they are trying to run the other direction so she's upset. Even secret service hated her guts
@FoxNews @IngrahamAngle Fox is trying to change it's tone now that it's leadership has been caught red handed. Still no proof against trump so trying to back peddle
@TheLeadCNN @CNN I guarantee we have soldiers in other parts of the world that only a handful of people even know about. Special forces means top secret
@GMA But the cia and fbi will black shit out. So it won't matter
@NBCNews The only people it saves money for is government because they don't pay for their healthcare. We do.
@NBCNews You people are stupid. There is no collusion between trump and Putin. It was all Hillary. And we have no reason to put sanctions on them
@CBSNews @ZekeJMiller Fake dossier to take focus off Clinton's collusion and sales of uranium to the Russians. But morons will still blame trump
@nytimes I love how people think he's treasonous but want Clinton to be President. Lie about trump but want a treasonous whore in office
@nowthisnews What a joke. He talks big when congress has been fucking the people for years. And now we have someone pointing it out and he's scared
@nowthisnews This guy is a fucking liar. We should have impeached Obama but no one said anything. We were on the brink of war before trump
@ABC Fuck her
@CBSNews Congress can go fuck themselves. They are part of the reason this country is in shambles. They should all be replaced with monkeys
@nowthisnews Who the fu k cares about your bible shit. Religion has nothing to do with running a country.
@FoxNews Obamas army getting ready to start shit again. It's nice knowing anyone can just walk in whenever they want and not be checked
@washingtonpost Because most of them aren't children. They are loser gang members. And the families that do come here get killed by these losers
@nowthisnews I wish the cake would have tipped over and crushed them both to death for their utter stupidity. They are both a waste of existence
@CNN The only reason the number went up was because dipshit Obama forced everyone to have it or you pay out your ass. Either way you pay too much
@nowthisnews Obama divided this country more on race than any President in history and he wants to run his mouth about the lies of trump. Fuck him
@nowthisnews If he's supporting someone then I sure as hell wouldn't vote for them.
@NBCNews If he's an illegal alien and working there they don't need a warrant. Ship his ass home and let him come back the legal way.
@CNN Which is absolutely true. They let in all the refugees and the terrorists came with them. And crime has soared.
@nowthisnews Figures another video comparing trump and republicans to racists. The democrats will stop at nothing to push their agenda and divide us all
@nowthisnews That's fucking disgusting. It's not a fucking woman and never will be. Born with a dick your a guy till the day you die
@CNN I'd fire their asses. It has nothing to do with inequality. It started because black criminals got shot. Just like all other races do
@seanhannity They now have proof Hillary was very much involved with many other Obama administration. Plus top FBI directors.and many more
@nowthisnews Psychiatrists are a joke for starters. And we Finally have a president that gives a shit about the country and where it's headed
@ABC Says the man that divided the country and allowed the government to screw the citizens.
@NBCNews Trump didn't divide people Obama and the democrats did with the help of their media. Always lying about shit. Fuck him
@ABC He helped make the political division.
@nowthisnews What a ridiculous fucking course.
@nowthisnews From one racist to another. Great plan jackasses
@SenGaryPeters Congress itself has been making it skyrocket for years now so don't blame them for shit you guys have already been doing
@CNN Nazi leftist piece of shit
@nytimes He did an interview years ago saying he did all of it and he looked like he loved it. He should be executed
@nytimes He's a piece of shit Nazi. And funds antifa and Hillary. People are stupid if they don't believe he was a Nazi collaborator.
@nowthisnews That's not at all what he said. More fake bullshit
@nytimes How the fuck do they know that. And how many tax dollars did they spend for these asshats to fake these numbers
@washingtonpost People dress up as people or things they like. If a little girl likes her then everyone else can fuck off
@washingtonpost Drown him
@ABC It's because she might finally go to prison for shit she was accusing trump of. Finally
@TODAYshow It's Hillary Clinton. It's the only job she's qualified for
@FoxNews @christocarbone Screw them. If the stupid white supremacists can do they're shit he can say what he wants about these idiots
@NBCNews He's a half baked idiot
@FoxNews All he does is run his fat mouth to get attention. We have anti missile systems for a reason. He can send one but it'll be destroyed
@nowthisnews Non-binary. That's the dumbest fucking thing. If you want to be gay or bi then whatever but this is just fucking stupid
@nowthisnews This video is almost a year old.
@GMA @GStephanopoulos That's because they get it all for free and don't want to spend money unless it's for their own greedy purposes
@CNN That's a bullshit story. And even if it was true it's even dumber to say it's trumps fault. Blame the real people.
@nowthisnews Hopefully this works because he's a shit actor
@AmazingiGrace Stop spreading your lies
@FoxNews He's been on it since day one. Now he wants to act like a bigger person. Too late loser
@WSJ @JerylBier Nope. It's a good start
@NBCNews Because churches are the most racist, lying and hateful  institutions to ever exist.
@nowthisnews Fuck him he's a loser. It's in the contract so they should be fired for not standing. And fined millions
@washingtonpost It's called freedom of the press not freedom of the press to spread every lie possible to make someone look bad. That's all they do
@ABC Prime example of why it should be legal to just shoot someone. He got away and will just do it again.
@NBCNews People won't die because of this. It was never affordable from the beginning. It costs almost as much for insurance as a home mortgage.
@washingtonpost Peice of shit mayor. Not governor
@washingtonpost All over blatant lies from a peice of shit governer. They have tons of aid but it's just sitting there.
@FoxNews @TuckerCarlson This coming from an organization that has been doing the very same thing for years.
@washingtonpost Democrat news. They never talked about impeaching Obama for purposely trying to ruin this country and for starting a race war
@NBCNews Fuck her.
@FoxNews @greggutfeld She had to make sure she removed all evidence from her system of being involved in his shit first
@CNN Yes it is. The other 2 countries use the taxes they collect for universal healthcare and hospitals. We pay high taxes then have to pay more
@NBCNews Good. They just showed a whole stadium full of food and water piled up everywhere but they say they are all starving and dying. Bullshit
@FoxNews All thanks to stupid ass dictator Obama. All him and his wife did was try fucking this country
@NBCNews So fucking what. She left it in 83 and only signed back up in 2003. The organization is a huge joke anyways
@FoxNews @LisaMarieBoothe She has a very valid point. Every bit of that is true
@CNN @CillizzaCNN Neither does the whole of Congress. Or they wouldn't have to keep worrying about a government shutdown twice a year.
@CNN Lying bitch. She was probably the one recording. I can't believe her lying ass in not in prison.
@ABC And every time you see that bitch on t.v. she is standing in front of piles of food and water. But it's trumps fault.
@ABC Puerto Rico only has it's own people to blame. Hundreds of containers of goods but their own truck drivers refuse to deliver.
@TheLeadCNN @CNN How can you use the constitution argument about lying almost every single day. These people are dumber than horse shit
@washingtonpost So many whiners. The media lies about shit all the time and noone ever calls them out. And when someone does they get blasted and lied about
@washingtonpost Mainstream media does it all the time to people they don't like. CNN has cut people off for saying things they don't like to hear.
@CBSNews No She's not. That worthless bitch fought to get a child molester free when she was a lawyer and made fun of the girl that was molested
@sashby1988 @WSJ There is no stopping the fact that there will be a ware and it all started with and because of the Clintons and the stupid democrats
@sashby1988 @WSJ They're already in danger because of north Korea. It's only a matter of time before his panties get in a bunch and he fucks up anyways
@9and10News What a crock of shit. It's one stupid rock. Whoever confiscated it should be hit over the head with it.
@sashby1988 @WSJ He could have gotten off his ass and imposed sanctions and gone to the U.N. like trump did. Or threaten them. But he's a wimp
@ABC The Spanish and templar knights were here way before indians
@WSJ If Obama hadn't been such a pussy north Korea wouldn't be such a problem now. Just like with Iran
@nowthisnews She's the one causing racial divide just like media and democrats for all their own agendas. Fuck them and her
@washingtonpost This post is a joke and so is the democrat run Washington post. Obama was more guilty of it but all these idiots worshipped him like fools
@nowthisnews How many times do you plan on reposting this garbage?  Until you get the anti gun responses you want?
@WSJ We need a different Republican and Democrat party that what we have. They are both corrupt and crooked.
@WellsFargoNews @WellsFargo @AmerBanker I have them through my job and they are a joke. You have to fight like hell just to get your own money.
@NBCNews We have special forces units for a reason. They could be in and out before anyone knows his fat sheep fucking ass is dead
@NBCNews Bullshit. Maybe people should learn to be more careful or both sides should deal with the consequences
@FoxNews @dbongino Schumer is a worthless piece of garbage. I'm surprised he can talk with Hillary's dick in his mouth.
@nbcsnl @GalGadot @samsmithworld @Jason_Aldean This show has gone way down hill. Especially trying to push this stupid anti gun agenda. Stupid ass democrat Hillary supporters.
@nowthisnews Just like Hillary did
@nowthisnews And her fake hot sauce storie
@PhillyStines @CBSNews Bullshit. It's democrats, blacks and media using the scary white person tactics for their agenda once again. Ever since Obama was elected
@CBSNews Chicago has strictest gun laws and higher gun crimes. Texas allows everyone to carry and crime rate dropped.
@CBSNews The NRA has nothing to do with it and gun control won't stop shit. People need to look at the difference between Texas and Chicago
@CBSNews A white nut job shoots people and everyone blames NRA. If he was black or Muslim there would be no gun control talk of any kind.
@nytimes These assholes have been doing it for years and no President has given a shit until now. Trumps the only one saying anything about it.
@ABC Who cares. The U.S. does the same shit just like every other country.
@9and10News They should hang that asshole from a street light and beat him with a club.
@ABC If they don't protect from someone who doesn't get one then what the hell good are they
@ABC That's a huge lie. If vaccines are so damn great then what difference does it make if someone doesn't get it as long as you have yours
@ABC A judge has no right to decide whether your kid gets a dangerous vaccine or not. Government needs to keep there hands out of family shit
@ABC He never should have been arrested in the first place. He was doing his job. The judge should be locked up
@9and10News Saving lives from that evil pot. Why not spend useful time on real drugs. The ones that actually kill people and hurt families you dipshits
@NBCNews @NBCLatino Obama's failed attempt to get Hillary elected. If they want to live here they can do it the legal way.
@WylieCoyote16 @nowthisnews Hahahahaha.  That's good
@CBSNews They keep saying assault rifles. What a joke. He had 4 guns. 3 of which I own myself.
@nowthisnews Gun violence problem. Give me a break. The gun violence problem is in Chicago every single day. You know, the place with the harshest laws
@nowthisnews Or you can get off your ass and find something constructive to do instead of wasting money on a piece of crap like this
@NBCNews Give me a break. Trump didn't listen to him. He still came out of there saying the same shit he did when he went in.
@NBCNews Let me guess. Killary supporters right. Upset because she lost due to her own incompetence and stupidity.
@NBCNews Like they did with the so called Muslim ban and the bullshit racism that was fueled by the media and is still being pushed by media
@NBCNews It's been negative because the media is run by democratic assholes and Hillary supporters so they have lied and attacked him since day 1
@NBCNews The lying ass mayor says they have no supplies and it's trumps fault. They have hundreds of recourses but truckers won't deliver them
@CBSNews @PressSec Gun control won't help with shit. The only people that believe it will are ignorant about guns and and the laws that are already there
@nytvideo @nytimes It's not a damn ban. Prime example of media blowing things up. It's a full background check before they are allowed here. Just like Mexicans
@upnorthlive It's pot, who cares.  Why not work on some real crimes.
@FoxNews @LawrenceBJones3 A few blacks get shot by cops for committing a crime and brandishing a weapon amd these asshats cry. More whites are shot by cops every year
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Everything media has been against him from the start. And all they've done is help make things worse
@nytimes God forbid you have to show proof of who you really are. You have to have an I.D for everything else
