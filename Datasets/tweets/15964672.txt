@C_Stroop @BetsyDeVosED "Dominionism, is .. a tendency among Protestant Christian evangelicals and fundamentalists that encourages them to not only be active political participants in civic society, but also seek to dominate the political process as part of a mandate from God.
@C_Stroop You could also read: Dominionism and Dominion Theology https://t.co/pXi1Nev4ga	This is the branch of The Christian Right, Dominionism and Theocracy which @BetsyDeVosED suscribes to. In fact, the Moral Majority is Dominionism , by another more Socially palatable name.

@kingsfoil2550 @DaddyDaddymac Last election he swore he would become a Democrat &amp; never run as an Independent again. Guess what he did next, he ran as an Independent for his Senate seat.
@DaddyDaddymac HE IS NOT A DEMOCRAT therefore he shouldn't be allowed to participate in any Democrat caucus or primaries. Why should he have access to @TheDemocrats Funding or Database? He's an Independent, let him run as one! We don't need his vote in the Senate. Its either 50+1 or 60 votes.

@RadioCity967 I grew up in the era of Elton John &amp; like millions of others, completely fell in love with his music. Last year (60 years on) I had my first chance to see him in concert. While the music was Great, I was put-off by his enormous EGO. Same reaction with Paul McCartney in 2006.
@SenGillibrand @amazon @NancyPelosi Alexandria Ocasio Cortez is to immature for the office she acquired Her brash antics will wear out quicker than a match struck in a hurricane.

@SenGillibrand @amazon BTW, don't get caught-up in the charisma of Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. She's nothing but a Street corner Anarchist who decided to cause trouble from the inside.

@SpeakerRyan I contacted Medicare &amp; complained. They refused to pay for this test &amp; charged Him with defrauding the Government. Unfortunately, his Greed only led him to deny All Medicare &amp; Medicaid covered Patients. Those with Private plans continue to be charged $110 before getting any Meds.
@SpeakerRyan It would do 2 things	1.) Eliminate the notion of becoming a Doctor for the sole purpose of getting Rich.	2.) Eliminate Fraud in billing - I had one Dr who mandated a Drug Screen ($110) each time prior to obtaining a prescription. This included obtaining High Blood Pressure meds.
@SpeakerRyan You are being Dishonest @SpeakerRyan. Along with Single-payer, Medicare for All comes Payment for each policy from each new member. There is NO raiding of Medicare since people pay their Premiums. What it does, is keep the costs down for ALL beneficiaries.
The Day before Midterm Election, Sanctions on @Iran for adhering to an agreeement yet, NO punishment of the Saudi Arabian Crown Prince for the Premeditated Murder &amp; cutting up the body with a Bone Saw to hide evidence of a US Journalist?

Each Senator, Congressperson or Presidential candidate is given a specific amount of Funds from their account. They have 3 or 6 months to campaign, without the need to raise funds. Spending more time explaiing why they are the best candidate.	What say you @GeraldoRivera ?
When a Senator or Congressperson is elected, they should focus on doing the Job they were hired to perform, not spend the time to raise campaign donations the entire time in office.	I'd rather a 3 account Election Bank for donations to their Party. Then Equal Funds per candidate.
Given American Politics in 2018, should State Campaigns be restricted to 3-months prior to Election Day? Should Presidential Campaigns be restricted to 6-months prior to Election Day?	Seems candidates take office &amp; begin campaigning immediately for their next election in 2-years.
