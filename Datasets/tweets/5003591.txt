@PaulHyde7 Ah. Once it's out in the open, the paper itself is inconsequential. ;)
My husband and I discussed how we would talk to our daughter about #nationalschoolwalkout today if she was old enough. Main takeaway was how important it would be to us that she understand the underlying issues and complexities rather than just following her friends.

Thinking a lot about the fear that fuels our lives and choices lately. And wishing I could shake the fear out of myself and others. What are we so afraid of?
