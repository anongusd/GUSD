@rachaelcombe They were at a press conference together when he said that this was what happened earlier in the day
Rare: Trump says he came in and said "I want to apologize to you" to May this morning. "Don't worry, it's only the press," she responded.
"Terrific woman....that Brexit is a very tough situation. She's going to do the best."
"Fake news," Trump says when asked to address his bombshell interview with The Sun, a paper that is Trump-friendly.
Trump on Brexit: "I don't know what they're going to do, but whatever you're going to do is OK with me."
Re Trump comments on Boris Johnson, @USAmbUK says: ""he was making general comments about Boris Johnson... He's found him to be affable, smart and interesting. That's where that comment came from, more than projection into the future...Americans like Boris Johnson."
also he asked me, "which comments, specifically," I was asking him about, and I had a very "polls, all of them," moment.
Just grabbed @USAmbUK at Trump-May presser. Re Sun story: "I don't think POTUS meant to add anything, he just stated what he stated a year ago. There's nothing new, really, except the timing. There's really nothing to report. As a reporter, this wasn't a good story."

Shorter Jared Kushner: I'm still here. After Russia probe and Kelly regime seem to push him to the margins, Kushner's first-ever public remarks on the ME remind people of his relevance in the administration. https://t.co/yVL9GKKnv4 v
We've moved on to other subjects. Haim Saban to Kushner: "tell us how you met Ivanka."
So far, the most concrete reason Kushner has offered that Trump can get peace in the ME when no one thinks he can, is that no one thought he could win the election, either.
There should be a word for when the questions are more quotable/tweetable than the answers.
Haim Saban is currently telling the anecdote recounted in this story https://t.co/PNXXmStbSB via @politicomag
Kushner: "there‚Äôs no better real estate lawyer than Jason Greenblatt, who‚Äôs been working on it. There are a lot of real estate issues to it."
Haim Saban to Kushner on his team: "‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not a Middle East macher in this group. With all due respect, it's a bunch of Orthodox Jews who have no idea about anything.‚Äù
Saban, one of Hillary Clinton's key backers in the 2016 race, introduces Jared Kushner, as "a 36-year-old successful businessman man who left it all behind to be of service to his country."
Compared + Contrast, as Jared gives his first public remarks on Middle East peace process, his off the record chat with congressional interns on the issue: https://t.co/boxF7GEQ2X via @WIRED
Spotted at the Saban Forum, ahead of Kushner's first-ever public remarks on Middle East peace: his lawyer, Abbe Lowell. (h/t @sbg1).
