@MobileIsNoBull @Karl_Deigert_RX @process_x @DavidJuurlink My wording was off.. claims made abt opiates being addicting and dangerous, with kratom,  overdose &amp; addiction isn't an issue.
@MobileIsNoBull @Karl_Deigert_RX @process_x @DavidJuurlink I personally never had an issue while on my meds, never asked for more, or ever given an increase.
