One young boy at the camp in Syria for ISIS families saw our camera and put up a single index finger. An ISIS sign. It was what children did in the group’s propaganda videos. This is a generation that needs attention. Forgetting them won’t make them go away.
Spoke to several foreign isis brides (German, Swedish, Russian, US-born) at camp in Syria. They talked like they were stranded tourists, lured in by false advertising. 100s of toddlers there too. Saw one missing a leg. What will happen to the thousands born under isis?
White House says 200 US troops to remains in Syria. All they have to do is: prevent return of ISIS, stop Turkish assault on Kurds, and curtail Russian and Iranian influence. But 200 also means a small int coalition likely stays. And 200 may grow ...		 https://t.co/kTea39ljJ7

While supporting ISIS is vile, and often criminal, recent history has shown abandoning extremists in faraway warzones with nowhere to go and no way back is dangerous. That is how al-Qaeda started.  The US should remember some of it's own lessons after 9/11.
There’s a double edged sword to declaring victory over isis’s Islamic State. Kurds worry it means the end of American support. They still want some, as part of an international coalition and worry Trump’s rip the bandaid off policy in Syria exposes an unhealed wound.
Noose tightening on the Isis “Islamic State.” A matter of days before it falls completely, US + Kurdish officials tell us.  But what happens to the 1000s of prisoners and families is still unclear. It’s not a minor issue. Al Qaeda was formed by militants who had nowhere to go.

Trump-Kim Summit in Hanoi. What a show.. But Where’s the beef?
In SOTU President Trump evoked great moments in US history, D-Day, Apollo landing, liberation of Nazi camps, saying greater days to come. Let’s hope so, but many in China and Russia believe that because of US political divisions and dysfunction, America’s era has peaked.
Trump, avoiding a landmine he’s stepped on before, says US troops are leaving Syria, but makes no mention of timeframe.
President Trump celebrating massive progress in the war on Isis - true- but the allies who fought with the US to make that possible - the Kurds- feel they are being abandoned.
While making threat to outspend others - read Russia- Trump says he’s open to negotiate a new deal on nuclear weapons after withdrawal from INF treaty, specifically mentions bringing in China.
This may be most bizarre claim of SOTU so far: Trump says there would be war with North Korea if he were not president.  It was his game of chicken with “little rocket man” that nearly started a war and had people in Seoul dusting out their bomb shelters.
Trump makes only brief mention of China and compliments Xi, talks about a deal, suggesting he may want one.

While both US and Russia point fingers of blame, a key reason for not allowing shorter-range land-based nuclear weapons is that shorter ranges mean less warning time — less time the missiles are in the air — increasing tension.
Putin says Russia also suspends INF nuclear treaty after Trump administration’s announcement, laying the ground for a potential nuclear arms race and a dangerous new era of nuclear brinkmanship.

More on tapes:  @NBCNews confirms Turkish authorities have told the US that Turkey has recordings from inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul that provide evidence that Khashoggi was killed inside.  So how will Saudi explain this? More denials? Blame a rogue agent? Blame Qatar?
RT @OARichardEngel: On @MSNBC with @mitchellreports, @RichardEngel discusses the disappearance of Washington Post columnist #JamalKhashoggi…
A Turkish official tells @NBCNews that Turkey’s government is “100 percent confident” that Khashoggi is dead and was killed by 15 Saudis who were in Turkey for a short amount of time.  		Sounds pretty definitive.
Saudi Arabia and Turkey agree to form a "Joint Team to Investigate Disappearance" of #JamalKhashoggi.  A step forward from Saudi Arabia after growing pressure from US/ Turkey/ Media .
Lawyer for Brunson says he’s on a plane to the US, after his release in Turkey.
Turkish judge ordered Pastor Brunson released earlier than his 3 yr sentence for good behavior and based on his impression that the American won’t commit crimes again. Brunson was arrested for allegedly helping militant groups and a failed coup against Erdogan, which he denies.
Two local media sources tell @NBCNews Pastor Brunson is having his ankle monitoring bracelet removed after Turkish authorities ordered an end to his detention/ house arrest, freeing him to leave the country.

Wow. Quote of the day:  Putin says “he knows how dossiers are made up.” Says he’s an ex-spy, a master in deception, then offers to help Mueller probe.
Putin proposing investigation for investigation.  Russia to help Mueller, if US helps on Magnitsy (reason for many US sanctions on Russia) and alleged US intelligence meddling.  Seems like a non-starter.
President Trump says indictments into election meddling came up with Putin in context of democrats trying to undermine Trump’s victory. Doesn’t sounds like Trump took Putin to task, but rather commiserated over it
What is Trump talking about? Says relations with Russia had never been worse, but now he fixed them.   They were dancing, literally dancing, in Moscow when Trump was elected.
So Putin seems to be proposing replacing Mueller probe: says Russia /US cooperation can investigate the allegations of cyber attacks on US elections, which Putin denies
Putin addressing Trump like Russian presidents have wanted to since the Cold War/ collapse of Soviet Union. His tone: We will solve the world’s problems together.  Putin has been complaining of American dominance for years- not now

Pence may have helped trump, more than Kaine helped Clinton tonight re- foreign policy. #VPDebate
Pence repeatedly mentioned “small” and bullying leader of Russia. Seems to be a memorized line. a campaign pivot away from Russia? #VPdebate
Russia emerging as a center of #VPDebate . Kaine suggesting Trump tax returns will expose compromising ties to Russia.
Pence spending a lot of time standing up to russia.  Perhaps realizing Trump seen as too close to Putin. #VPDebate
Both Pence and Kaine say they support safezone in Syria to help people of Aleppo, but avoiding specifics. #VPDebate
Pence talking tough on Putin.  That’s not what trump has been saying.  So which is it? #VPDebate
Pence linking refugees to US to terrorism. Refugees to the US screened many times, unlike in Europe where borders broken down. #VPdebate
Pence talks about refugees involved in attacks in Paris. Refugees to the US not similar. vetted. Not showing up from boats. #VPDebate
Pence says ISIS born bec US forces didn’t stay in Iraq. that’s part of it, but ISIS a result of destruction of iraq/ syria. #VPdebate
Most security experts also say terrorism likely to get worse with Trump serving as a lightning rod for extremists.  #VPDebate
Kaine says terrorist threat decreased in past 8 years. Many security experts don’t agree. #vpdebate.
Hard say Middle East in good shape now. faults from bush’s misguided action. obama’s inconsistency. Clinton certainly part of it. #VPDebate
Pence hitting hard on foreign policy, that iraq chaos, isis, all legacies of Clinton leadership. but seeds go back to bush actions #VPdebate

Is it right Israel plans to lobby US congress to try to kill the deal? Is that legal?

much of iran nuc deal comes down to trust. Trust a deal leads to a more included/peaceful iran, or fear it just adds fuel to sectarian fire
On the downside, hardliners could try to ride out and cheat iran nuc deal, take the influx of cash, and make the region more unstable.
Iran nuc deal could lower oil prices analysts say, a benefit for the US, and overtime could embolden reformers in iran.

Isis is a band of murderers, its strength comes from others weakness and divisions .
The US can drone and weaken isis, but a decade has shown, the US is not qualified to mediate sunni shiite divide.
Was this really the strategy for syria thats been three years in the making?
So the strategy is airstrikes, arab moral support to get sunnis on message, and rebuilding iraqi army (again) .  Tough
President again compared this strategy to yemen.  In yemen there is a partnered government. In syria there is a hostile adversary.
President keeps talking about partners and a broad coalition. I see broad verbal support, but few battle partners on the ground
Many Sunni communities in iraq scared of iraqi army that the president says will Defend sunnis from isis
Few indications here in iraq the new government is inclusive and free of sectarian divides.
President evokes slain journalists #JamesFoley and #StevenSotloff by name to illustrate threat to US "civilians and personnel"
Doing nothing against isis does have a cost.  The group is dangerous. Military officials i speak to all want action. Then what?
There is a perception that US special ops and drones can solve everything.. Not the 1400 year old sunni shiite divide that fuels isis

Army officials tell NBC priority is to get Bergdahl back to full health, reunited with his family, but preparations for an inquiry underway
Army inquiry would determine whether a formal investigation into possible criminal charges against #Bergdahl is warranted.
Anger grows at freed POW #Bergdahl. Much of it from the soldiers who served with him. WATCH my @todayshow report: http://t.co/SScVhzamTd
The Army will also investigate the circumstances that led to the deaths of six soldiers during search operations for #Bergdahl.
NBC News has learned US Army is preparing to launch inquiry into  circumstances and personal conduct of  Bergdahl disappearance and capture
There is a cost for every transaction. For the only U.S. POW in #Afghanistan it was the release of 5 #Taliban leaders http://t.co/FR5LQ5QxMR
soldier who served with #Bergdahl says he left behind his body armor, night goggles, all sensitive equipment before leaving his best.
Soldier who served with #bergdahl calls him a “deserter,” tells NBC his unit did extra missions to find him. Blames 2 deaths on search.

3/4 Taliban detail #Bergdahl release: Bergdahl was told that he could go home if everything went according to plan just before he was moved
2/4 Taliban detail #Bergdahl release: The venue where we transferred the prisoner was chosen by the Islamic Emirate and accepted by the US.
1/4 Taliban detail #Bergdahl release: Even those who were protecting and looking after Bergdahl did not know anything until the last minute
4/4 taliban member describes #bergdahl release: Both helicopters left immediately and our Mujahedin returned to their base safely.
