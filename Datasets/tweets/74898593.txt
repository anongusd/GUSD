@WonkoSD We do list that as an option. cc
@BenHigginsSD @vosdscott Cities have been doing it since '06. So not new. Just trying to present options since motive is to move away from having June elections. If that's what is wanted, let's do it. cc
@BenHigginsSD That's plurality and 16 cities in SD do that now, along with 36 of top 50 cities in CA. So not unheard of. Another option we presented is rank choice voting, which is different and requires a candidate to get a majority. cc
@BenHigginsSD Not sure I follow. Local elections are non-partisan. No R or D behind the name. cc
The intent of Measures K &amp; L was to have the highest turnout electing our city‚Äôs leaders. This proposal will build upon these measures by allowing the most voters to vote for a full field of candidates, not just the top two, thus leveling our election playing field. https://t.co/pSOpxAYwMi
