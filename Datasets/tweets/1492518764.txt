@CombsLantre @LaylaAlisha11 @mlcherenfant Ok you give your life for the one to be born. And now the other 2 or so and the wife has to raise them on their own. Sounds a bit selfish if you ask me
@ThurySteve @OliverMcGee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @AOC @CoryBooker @BernieSanders @KamalaHarris Sure and Kim Jong Un knows nothing about torhering Otto or anyone else. And you believe him because Trump said it was true. You the man lol
@LaylaAlisha11 @mlcherenfant I'm Democrat and a baby born should have every right you and I have. But when it comes to abortion you can't know every situation. If it between a mother's life or the babies life she should have the choice to save her life and support the children she already has.

I know not to trust Trump I had that experience. Now I'm not sure you can trust Trump supporters. Questions
@KathrynMaga @EdKrassen @BarackObama @HillaryClinton Why do you keep writing. Ivanka said it I really don't care do you.
@KathrynMaga @EdKrassen @BarackObama @HillaryClinton Just because you write doesn't make it true. Just because the man on t.v. says it going to rain doesn't make it rain. You can hide behind God but that doesn't mean you are guaranteed heaven. Good luck with your Trump worship but I know him too well
@rookieuserIm Imagination is so much fun. But Trump makes it funny
@KathrynMaga @EdKrassen @BarackObama @HillaryClinton Can't tell by that thread. If that's California I'm told it was done before Trump. It's not near a river that everyone is complaining about. I know Trump before he was on t.v. and I know he can't be trusted.
