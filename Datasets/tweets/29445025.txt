@maureen197203 @AltHomelandSec They were mad at President Obama because he didn't get their son home, so they jumped on the Trump Train.
@blackbird726 @NatResources @AOC @SenMarkey They really need to ask AOC for some social media tips.
@jonlovett No more pizza next time. Beef sandwiches. White Castles. Garrett popcorn. Manny's corned beef. All go well with Malort. Thanks for a great show tonight.

@JakeVK @jonlovett @petersagal @AkilahObviously @bellwak It was so much fun. And, what did I see when I logged on to Twitter? Dennis Rodman was trending.
@Jeanshelley5 @RoKhanna The only relationship Trump cares about is the one that allows him to build the first hotels in North Korea. He has no interest in anything other than deals that add to his family's bank accounts.
@jumpinjonnydee @smarmyEOD @RoscoeBDavis1 @JaxBemused @AlanDersh @FDRLST You bore me now.

@LaAmbivert74 Oh LaAmbivert...it seems like you need to go back to English class soon. Perhaps the bot farm can help you understand basic grammar and punctuation.
@loridawn55gmai1 @politico It's a sad day in America when deplorables continue to defend Trump, even though they know he's a vindictive liar.
@michael_mosher @DFBHarvard It hurts that everything Cohen has said tracks with previous rumors, eh? Cohen lied for Trump. Cohen is far more credible than Don The Con.
@BillyMalarkey @IngrahamAngle Oh you sweet talker Billy. You must be very popular.
@laceyd500gmail1 @TomSteyer @Jim_Jordan Bless your heart Lacey for trying to participate in the conversation. Jordan and Trump are both morons. Neither could school anyone on anything. Thanks for trying, though.
@BillyMalarkey @IngrahamAngle A bot with zero followers says Trump is clean so it must be true. :)
@JimBresee @joelpollak @DonaldJTrumpJr Cohen is not lying. Everything he has said so far tracks with stories already in the public. He's simply verifying rumors as truth.
@gdragich @MattWalshBlog Bless your heart George for being such a simple minded idiot that you still believe Trump is anything but a con man.
Gracious the deplorables are melting down today. It's so much fun! https://t.co/u1TK1xwRZd
@jumpinjonnydee @RoscoeBDavis1 @JaxBemused @smarmyEOD Bless your heart Jumpin Jonny Dee. You don't think you're a deplorable? Have you read your own tweets?
@RoscoeBDavis1 @jumpinjonnydee @JaxBemused @smarmyEOD It's do funny that deplorables are still defending Trump. Cohen lied for Trump. Committed bank fraud for Trump. It all ties back to Trump, but you can just keep your head in the sand. It is easier than admitting your hero is simply Don The Con.
@Jeanshelley5 @RoKhanna It's so funny, Jean, that you think Trump is negotiating anything. The "summit" is just a dog and pony show to make North Korea look like a world player. Trump will get taken like he always does. He cannot negotiate anything.
The @GOP stupidity runs deep among deplorables. https://t.co/jWVN8pvgTe
@HDBroadcastAZ @realDonaldTrump @MercedesColwin @FoxBusiness @Eliances There is never going to be a wall, but bless your heart for still thinking that it will be built. @realDonaldTrump is a con man. He played to the base just so he could sit in office an enrich his family.
@MToppeta @PinkyRich @theladysitter @JussieSmollett What are you bored tonight Mikey? I did not defend Jussie. I said we should wait for the detectives to finish their investigation. I also said it was a hoax. Perhaps you need to go back to reading comprehension class?

@Schuylerroad17 @joealter1 @testisfidelis @BillBurke2000 I keep hearing that one reason the base elected Trump was that they were tired of people laughing at them and wanted someone to champion their causes. Yet, deplorables just keep giving us reasons to laugh at their stupidity. It would be really funny if it wasn't so sad.
@AuthorKimberley It's how we ended up in the whole mess. We needed to stomp on all the conspiracy theories, vile comments, etc. Instead we shook our heads and said, "They don't really believe that stuff." We allowed it to fester until enough idiots took it as truth. Now we have Trump.
