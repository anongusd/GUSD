@HavokHawk Making accusations that have no merit in order to slander the candidate &amp; the process is unethical. THAT is what I'm saying!
#FNC #Hannity et. al. Support your #Trump &amp; coddle &amp; defend him! But stop lying ab &amp; slandering #Cruz and #RNC &amp; convention fear mongering!
#Hannity loves 2 ask if GOP can/will unify around nominee but he throws gasoline upon process w/ lies &amp; hyperbole while holding the match!
Maybe some of you can tell that I've flat out had it at this point! The lies ab #Cruz bribing delegates &amp; rhetoric against RNC is appalling!

@PastorSJCamp ....that's why I make a point of not acting Pharisaical toward other doctrines to such an extent that I'm missing the heart...
@PastorSJCamp I understand the doctrinal differences. I also understand God's concern is the condition of our hearts....
@NytFury @PastorSJCamp I've prayerfully considered my vote since November (our primary was Tues). I'm sure you'll do the same.
@NytFury @PastorSJCamp OK Jai. Well I wish you well in your prayerful consideration of this decision!
@NytFury @PastorSJCamp You can say that.... But you are certainly dug in on defending one over the other as evidenced by this exchange...
@NytFury @PastorSJCamp Heresy and bearing false prophecy.....you are really confident in throwing those assumptions around?
@NytFury @PastorSJCamp How exactly have I rationalized Cruz? I have purposely not really said anything about him.
@NytFury @PastorSJCamp Ongoing sinful conditions.....I feel like you're being purposely obtuse b/c your dug in to your position
@NytFury @PastorSJCamp Theres a difference between the sinner who scoffs at Grace &amp; the man who has submitted to Christ but misses the mark
@NytFury @PastorSJCamp Recognizing one as prideful, mocker, scoffer, adulterer, etc...these are character traits, not 1 sinful act....
@NytFury @PastorSJCamp I'm also saying principles are mode important than one's sins. There is a clear diff in the principles of these ppl
@NytFury @PastorSJCamp @AZMatador why is the sin of a man who doesn't seek forgiveness any worse than the 1 silent on heresy? @PastorSJCamp
@NytFury @PastorSJCamp ....better than who you seem to condemn as "hypocrites". You simply have a different rationalization u wish to make
@NytFury @PastorSJCamp ...of recognition for their need of grace and Christ is important... Then you've decided to rationalize &amp; are no.....
@NytFury @PastorSJCamp This is obviously not the two way exchange of thought I thought it was. If you can seriously ask how one's lack....
@NytFury @PastorSJCamp I'd ask you don't play the game where you take what I say &amp; replace w/ some over the top assumption/leap...
@NytFury @PastorSJCamp ...of other's obedience to it. However it's not hard to see absence of fruits &amp; basic principle in some.
@NytFury @PastorSJCamp You speak in these overly bold, prideful &amp; judgemental broad statements. I'm bold in the Word, but not in judgement..
@NytFury @PastorSJCamp ....an adulterer, a mocker, scoffer, bully....etc. Basically a person who doesn't appear to abide in Proverbs @ all
@NytFury @PastorSJCamp You're correct, &amp; as stated before I do wonder why they support someone who says he's never asked forgiveness....
@PastorSJCamp ...and we certainly do not know the heart of another. Only God can truly know that. I'd suggest a pride check...just suggest
@PastorSJCamp ...it's dangerous ground for a man to judge another based on even a self-given label, rather than fruits of their actions...
@PastorSJCamp That is not 100% true. I've met ppl who say they are Mormon Christains but don't realize how evangelical Christian they are...
@NytFury @PastorSJCamp I'm also not so hauty as 2 think I know some1 by a label rather than by their deeds &amp; actions, i don't generalize ppl
@NytFury @PastorSJCamp ....principles in favor of a "strong man" personified by Trump who is unprincipled. Not sure what your Mormon PT is..
I feel the exact same way, except my concern/disappointment is in the way Evangelicals seemingly abandoned..... https://t.co/0UjEizIH76

@CaliAzona ...is deplorable and not the kind of person I want to associate with at all. Not one bit. Even of in the end He is right &amp; Greg..

@LourdesBF728 @vic16pip25 Hardly a victim. The convo wasn't ugly till u &amp; your trolls joined. Just for the record, Lourdes, ol buddy ol pal.
@LourdesBF728 @vic16pip25 Actually, you didn't HAVE TO join the convo at all which led to blocking ppl. U joined convo w/ ppl u disagree w/
@CaliAzona But that was just my opinion. I felt strong enough to act on it. I don't expect everyone should just cuz I did :-)

@nopartyforme Typical that you can't back up or explain your opinion when asked very nicely to do so.
@LourdesBF728 @Boothacus @SolJewEgg Go ahead and tell a Muslim they are praying to the god of Christianity. You'll prolly be beheaded.
@LourdesBF728 @SolJewEgg @DanielBenBen I have never used the word pagan in this convo. Making stuff up now? How boring.
@LourdesBF728 @SolJewEgg @DanielBenBen I'm getting back to work thanks for the laugh narcissist!
@LourdesBF728 @SolJewEgg @DanielBenBen WRONG! All that "education" of yours just going to waste. Haha.
@LourdesBF728 @SolJewEgg @DanielBenBen / LOL. You're seriously a gem aren't you. You must lose sleep at night getting all riled up a/b being
@LourdesBF728 @SolJewEgg @DanielBenBen To simplistically draw that academic conclusion disregards what it means to believe &amp; follow a god.
@LourdesBF728 @SolJewEgg @DanielBenBen ...in NO WAY means the gods they worship are the same god in nature, character, commands, ect...
@LourdesBF728 @SolJewEgg @DanielBenBen Fact: Just because the Ishmael/Isaac story says Abrahamic God is origin of multiple religions...
@LourdesBF728 @SolJewEgg @DanielBenBen Why do you say I hate Muslims? I made no such comment.
@LourdesBF728 @SolJewEgg @DanielBenBen Whatever helps you save face. Your pals will believe you.

@nopartyforme That's just dumb. It was your opinion, you can't stand by it or back it up? Typical.
@LourdesBF728 @SolJewEgg @DanielBenBen Catholic basher? Not at all. I clearly point out my disagreements w/ Catholics but I've never bashed
@LourdesBF728 @SolJewEgg @DanielBenBen ...discussions. U think Muslims should have all kinds of lead way, but Israel is mean &amp; wrong! Lol
@LourdesBF728 @SolJewEgg @DanielBenBen That isn't even close to why I believe u are anti-Semite. It is your comments on Israel from prior...
@LourdesBF728 @SolJewEgg @DanielBenBen That's a true sign of courage, confidence, &amp; conviction. State your claim then run &amp; hide/block lol
@TellyStern Dude, you have a whole acct dedicated to hating on you? http://t.co/ahBhdrgRni
@TellyStern Hasidic, Reform, Messianic, Orthodox, ect.....? Is that the right track at least?
@TellyStern Right. 	On that note, gotta work tomorrow. Take care bro. Be well.
@TellyStern Right. Others began to refer to those following Jesus as "Christians" in a mocking sense.
@TellyStern Jesus gives strong teaching in NT gospels to Gentiles not to forget that salvation is from the Jews. Obviously God's chosen ppl
@TellyStern Unlike Muslims, we actually do worship the same God. Obvious differences about Christ &amp; His divinity. But same Living God.
@TellyStern ...beliefs.
@TellyStern I know that. No worries. For the most part, at least from my experience...Jews &amp; Christians are respectful of each others...
@TellyStern ...really good drugs. Haha, totally kidding.
@TellyStern I mean i know historically there were Gnostics. But I reject their message &amp; beliefs. In a way, I think they just had some...
@TellyStern I was curious about Gnosticism as a new believer years ago, but after reading more &amp; prayerful consideration, I reject it.
@TellyStern ...entertain any of it as I see it as garbage.
@TellyStern Ya, I've seen crazy books, Time Mag articles, History Channel shows, ect., claiming all kinds of stuff. I choose to not even...
@TellyStern That believed Jesus was a zealot?
@TellyStern I don't claim to know the answer to this tho, or even to have an educated opinion. This is brand new to me.
@TellyStern Some indeed did. And God sanctioned wars in the OT. However in NT Jesus teaches obedience to governmental authority.
@TellyStern I am always skeptical of using Wikipedia as a source of learning something new though. Lol. Not always reliable
@TellyStern ...the bible. But that is just taking one sentence from browsing the page. I'll have to read it better later.
@TellyStern This says the zealots advocated violence against Rome and the Sadducees, I'm not sure I can square that w/ Jesus' teaching in..
@TellyStern That is where Lourdes is so often wrong. Simplistic views with no context &amp; certainly void of cause/effect.
@TellyStern I totally agree with that.
@TellyStern Interesting. I'll have to read up more on that.
@TellyStern ...and those who were religious zealots, fervently keeping the law and "zealous" a/b living for God.
@TellyStern I'm not well educated about that. Only what I read in the bible. The religious zealots wanting to fight for freedom from Rome..
@TellyStern Ppl who were saying Christianity is basically like Islam makes me cringe  Just SO SO wrong.
@TellyStern Zealot as in strongest adherence to God, then yes.
@TellyStern IMO, depends on hoe you r using the word zealot. As in the political sense, I don't think Jesus had any part of that biblically
@TellyStern I must have missed that part. Don't recall who said that or in what context.
Hey Seattle, I'm a brown-bag citizen.
@TellyStern I won't even attempt to get into the head of crazies

@LourdesBF728 @emaleroland @CaliAzona No one is arguing origin of these religions. But 2 say they worship same god is very simplistic &amp;

@markguinn @CaliAzona @emaleroland @LourdesBF728 ...I shared the bible with you, sir. Hurts my heart when ppl are so closed to God's truth.
@markguinn @CaliAzona @emaleroland @LourdesBF728 / You apparently don't give a crap about the bible either. I haven't shared what I believe,
How very Catholic of you. RT “@markguinn: People are stupid”
@markguinn @CaliAzona @emaleroland @LourdesBF728 / Rather it makes YOU narrow minded &amp; intolerant. Read a book, maybe start w/ the bible.
@markguinn @CaliAzona @emaleroland @LourdesBF728 / Why? Because I am pointing out holes in your beliefs? That makes me ignorant?
@markguinn @CaliAzona @emaleroland @LourdesBF728 / "Christian" does, as in Antioch they mockingly referred to followers of Christ.
@markguinn @CaliAzona @emaleroland @LourdesBF728 ...the laypeople? Bottom line is "pope" or "catholic" do not show up in Acts.

@markguinn @CaliAzona @emaleroland @LourdesBF728 - Where does the term Catholic show up anywhere in the bible? I won't even bother to...
@markguinn @CaliAzona @emaleroland @LourdesBF728 / Where in the Book of Acts is the term pope used?
@markguinn @CaliAzona @emaleroland @LourdesBF728 ...of Catholic parishioners to ignore what is written in the bible in favor of tradition.
@markguinn @CaliAzona @emaleroland @LourdesBF728 Your incomplete sentence doesn't explain anything. Sadly, &amp; w/all DUE respect it is typical
@markguinn @CaliAzona @emaleroland @LourdesBF728 ...was even conceptualized.
@markguinn @CaliAzona @emaleroland @LourdesBF728 ..first used in Antioch to describe the 1st generation Christians. Far before Catholicism..
@markguinn @CaliAzona @emaleroland @LourdesBF728 / There is no logical way that can be true. Especially since the term "Christian" was...
@LourdesBF728 / I tried polite, it's pointless with you. You are 1 of most arrogant &amp; impolite ignoramuses on Twitter. So what's the point?
@LourdesBF728 @CaliAzona / Wrong. End of story.
@LourdesBF728 @CaliAzona / I'm out. Feel free to leave your snark in my TL &amp; I'll reply tomorrow if I feel like it. Hope U learned from Cali
@LourdesBF728 @CaliAzona ...they have abandoned Him for a "god" that is very different from the True &amp; Living God of Abram.
@LourdesBF728 @CaliAzona / Just because Muslims come from Ishmael, son of Abram...doesn't mean they worship the same God of Abram...

@LourdesBF728 @CaliAzona If it doesn't fit your agenda, then it's flat wrong &amp; irrelevant. Not even any graciousness 4 the person you're...
@LourdesBF728 @CaliAzona ..it's all about what YOU believe, what YOU were taught...No room @ all for the relevant views of others. Arrogant!
@LourdesBF728 @CaliAzona Pretty amazing. U can't even bring yourself to acknowledge Cali is making a reasonable point in a polite way...
@CaliAzona ...in favor of THEIR god. 		Anyway, good night :-)	Just be careful with her. She has some really bad agendas.
@CaliAzona She thinks because they are descendants of Ishmael &amp; this Abram, then they worship same god. Truth is they threw off the God...
@CaliAzona She has an agenda to legitimize Muslims &amp; their religion by trying to say their god is the same God Christians worship.
@CaliAzona l&amp; yes, my phone is dying :-) http://t.co/RJ595qSVND
@CaliAzona ..a very good job. Nice to meet you &amp; God bless you (the True &amp; Living God!)
@CaliAzona ...god. The God of Abraham is not the god of the Taliban simply because Muslims descend from Ishmael. You know? You are doing...
@CaliAzona ...groups. That goes against what god is, in any religion. When a religion chooses to change god, they no longer worship the same
@CaliAzona She is taking an extremely elementary &amp; simplistic view of an important paradigm. One god cannot be so different to various ppl..
@CaliAzona You won't get her to acknowledge the relevancy of your point, but u are exactly right &amp; doing a great job explaining it!
@LourdesBF728 @CaliAzona ...twitter tonight. It kills me to see you bully &amp; misinform people so brazenly on here all the time.
@LourdesBF728 @CaliAzona But my phone is dying, I'm tired, &amp; you are boring me. So I'm out. Please try not to mislead my kind friends on...
@LourdesBF728 @CaliAzona ...the topic. I'm sorry it frustrates you so much to run into someone who can actually challenge &amp; correct you.
@LourdesBF728 @CaliAzona LOL. That is your brilliant response? I have studied science, art, &amp; religion of medieval Islam. I understand...
@LourdesBF728 @CaliAzona @emaleroland Incorrect. The god Muslims worship = very diff characteristics as the Judeo-Christian God of the bible
@LourdesBF728 @CaliAzona @emaleroland Jews and Christians derive their faith from the same Living God. Same characteristics, commands, ect.
@LourdesBF728 @CaliAzona ...in 140 characters at times.
@LourdesBF728 @CaliAzona I'm sorry if I'm speaking above your level. My ideas are very sound &amp; legitimate. Tho it is a challenge to explain
@CaliAzona @LourdesBF728 @emaleroland ...the same god? That would clearly be diff gods by definition. On its face, obviously diff gods.
@CaliAzona @LourdesBF728 @emaleroland If portrayal, expectations, characteristics, commands, emphasis, ect., are all diff...how can that be
@CaliAzona @LourdesBF728 I said she doesn't have a right to NOT be offended. So many these days want to censor others b/c they are offended.
@LourdesBF728 @CaliAzona @emaleroland @ChangeItBack16 @TheRightWingM ...same person? Well, they certainly don't all believe god is a person
@LourdesBF728 @CaliAzona @emaleroland @ChangeItBack16 @TheRightWingM ...that another believes god did do...how can that be same god?
@LourdesBF728 @CaliAzona @emaleroland @ChangeItBack16 @TheRightWingM ..different things, did different things or did not do things ...
@LourdesBF728 @CaliAzona @emaleroland @ChangeItBack16 @TheRightWingM What does "same god" mean? If they believe in a god that commands ...
@LourdesBF728 @CaliAzona @emaleroland @ChangeItBack16 @TheRightWingM That is not only false, but it is 100% irrational to believe that.
@LourdesBF728 @CaliAzona Well genius, I couldn't very well welcome you to a country that neither of us are currently occupying, could I?

@TellyStern @TheRightWingM Agreed. It was complicated.

@HeidiL_RN What do you guys believe neoconservatism means?
@becca51178 @RednaxalA @SpencerWolfePtL @HeidiL_RN LEVIN is too much a patriot 2 play silly games like that. Period!
@TheRightWingM @TellyStern Hard to say. We really weren't ready to own a broken Iraq then either. But it's hard to say what should have been
@becca51178 @RednaxalA @SpencerWolfePtL @HeidiL_RN THAT is flat out FALSE, at least in Levin's case. FALSER than FALSE.
@TellyStern @TheRightWingM True. He sadly was a failure domestically. Was only adequate on foreign policy. IMHO

@becca51178 @TheRightWingM @HeidiL_RN Wow, w/ all due respect...listen to Heidi b/c u are badly misinformed. U sound more classical liberal
@becca51178 @HeidiL_RN @Steveadvil @hyperion5182 How is it insane to get behind someone early? U even said a long primary hurt Romney.
@FreedomsPatriot Thank you sir. You are #1600 for me! Appreciate it!
@becca51178 @TheRightWingM @HeidiL_RN HW Bush was a domestic disaster which is why he lost reelection to Clinton. Got waxed in fact.
@becca51178 @TheRightWingM @HeidiL_RN Bush raised taxes &amp; killed the Reagan job growth machine!
@becca51178 @TheRightWingM @HeidiL_RN That is what I believe, wholeheartedly. I believe it &amp; there is a ton to back up that position.
@becca51178 @HeidiL_RN @Steveadvil @hyperion5182 ..and get behind him/her EARLY and all the way! No long primary like last time.
@becca51178 @HeidiL_RN @Steveadvil @hyperion5182 But we do need to find a solid constitutional conservative to govern boldly for the people
@becca51178 @HeidiL_RN @Steveadvil @hyperion5182 ...Like Rubio &amp; Ryan who were republican heroes just recently.

@becca51178 @JoyJoyespinoza3 @HeidiL_RN Romney actually got fewer votes than McCain.
@becca51178 @TheRightWingM @HeidiL_RN That is true. But he never got conservative. voters coalesce around him.
@becca51178 @TheRightWingM @HeidiL_RN REAGAN? Noooo, would call him Originalist &amp; the Answer!

@NoInfidel33 @Gerilenn @4PatriotsDream I want to dive into a focused study on the Resolution from the movie Courageous. I need to step up...
@Frostviper @NaughtyBeyotch I can't see it going anywhere, but will send a loud message.
@Frostviper @NaughtyBeyotch I don't know if it has teeth, prob not, but there is talk here in AZ of a recall effort on McCain &amp; Flake
@NoInfidel33 @Gerilenn @4PatriotsDream  Ya, he has many other good books too, like The Grace Awakening. But the Characters books are great!
@Gerilenn @NoInfidel33 @4PatriotsDream Totally agree! U can take over a month on short book like Eph, but get SOOO much from it.
@NoInfidel33 @Gerilenn @4PatriotsDream Also, if we are sharing faves, the 1st book that lead me to Jesus was Peace with God, Billy Graham
@NoInfidel33 @Gerilenn @4PatriotsDream ...all of his Characters of the Bible are really good studies. Gets u so much deeper in stories
@NoInfidel33 @Gerilenn @4PatriotsDream Charles Swindoll is awesome too! The David book was amazing. There is Esther, Joseph, Paul, ECT..
@Gerilenn @NoInfidel33 @4PatriotsDream Exactly! The Spirot teaches us, and she doesn't step on that. Just guidance thru the study.
@NoInfidel33 @Gerilenn @4PatriotsDream ...learning it by passage, chapter, book, &amp; in whole. It is slow, but learn so much!!!
@NoInfidel33 @Gerilenn @4PatriotsDream The Inductive Method that Kay teaches is an awesome way to study. System to marking passages &amp;
@Gerilenn @NoInfidel33 @4PatriotsDream That was the one I started with. It was awesome. The method where you mark up the passages right?
@NoInfidel33 @Gerilenn @4PatriotsDream Yes! I love Charles Stanley. Books and podcasts.
@NoInfidel33 @4PatriotsDream Saw Francis Chan here in Phoenix. Love all of his books, and some great messages on YouTube!
@NoInfidel33 @4PatriotsDream Both are very good, &amp; I am very choosy about what authors we will read &amp; study :)	No false teachers!
@NoInfidel33 @4PatriotsDream Actually I think I'm thinking of Kay Arthur. But I have bought Beth Moore books for my wife. Good writer.
@NoInfidel33 @4PatriotsDream Is she the Inductive Study writer? If so I love those also!

@smokescreek / Bush was attacked 24/7 for everything he did and didn't do. Where were you living from 2000-2008?
@smokescreek The issue certainly is NOTA rehashing the Bush Presidency. Obama's actions have nothing 2 do w/ what Bush did or didn't do.
@smokescreek You argue by misdirection, typical of liberals. The issue here is the cover-up &amp; refusal to answer to oversight committees.
