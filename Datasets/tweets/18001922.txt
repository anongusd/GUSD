In the U.S., if a pregnant woman is murdered, it's considered a double homicide.		Yet an abortionist can dismember, suction, or poison to death preborn babies through all nine months and it's called a right.		Let's be intellectually honest: A human being is human at every stage.
Health care heals ‚Äî it does not kill.		Abortion is the only procedure that intentionally aims for a 100% death rate.		Abortion isn‚Äôt health care.
A woman's womb is different from tissue, organs, or blood ‚Äî it exists for the baby.		Each month the uterus prepares for someone else's body.		The woman can survive without a uterus; her baby can't.		The preborn have a right to the body like an infant has a right to be nurtured.

Parents have a duty to care for their child:		If parents starve a toddler to death, it's homicide.	If parents don't shelter a toddler, it's neglect.	If parents harm a toddler, it's abuse.		Pregnancy is a parent-child relationship. 		The child is only inside the mother's body.
If a woman smokes, drinks, or does drugs while pregnant, she would be criticized by society for harming her child.		Yet a woman can abort her baby through all nine months of pregnancy and society calls it a legal "right."		It's time our laws catch up with science and reason.
