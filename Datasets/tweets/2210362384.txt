@williamfinnegan @reedosherdfan @Jdownwv @SenCapito @IntelligencerWV @SenateGOP You lose the personal deduction of over 4000$...so for single. Standard deduction of 6000$ plus personal dedct is 10350$.  12000$ is doubled the difference is only 1650$....that's yr tax break 1650$

@reedosherdfan @Jdownwv @SenCapito @IntelligencerWV @SenateGOP Don't b fooled...pull out yr 1040 frm last year.  Last yr u got for single person 6300$ standard deduction plus a 4050$ personal exemption which is taken away.  Do the math yr only getting a 1650$ difference minus all the programs they r cutting. It's a scam a lie.  Reasearch it

@HillaryClinton I tried calling the number and I think it was hacked.  It doesn't ring.  Please post correct phone number to call.  P.S.  I appreciate your interest in CHIP and sending out the message for people to get involved and make that so needed phone call
@RobertFHiggins @HouseGOP @stevenmnuchin1 Yes...they all are getting ready UNBELIEVABLE
@HouseGOP Did u forget to mention the personal exemption is disappearing so to double the standard deduction is a wash...who's ahead...the wealthiest
Idk anymore there is just too much BS
This tax cut will increase the deficit by trillion(s) and to make up for some of that cut Medicaid by over a billion
@KatharineTowne @MichaelSLinden Medicaid...they want to cut by 1 billion$$$..which is their way around the ACA
@rjayw62 @SenToomey @chucktodd @MeetThePress Who says we will get a pay increase...no one...yr right tho if big corps are getting big cuts...then min. Wage should b raised
@hereticalstoic @SenToomey @chucktodd @MeetThePress I think its 4 trillion...not certain
@FoxNews @SenToomey Wow. You are promoting this so called tax cut so we will only have a one page annual 1040 return.  You're right that's all we are going to get.   WOW just WOW...come up with something better than that but you CAN'T
@SenateGOP @SenToomey you do a commercial but where you are you at town meetings.  You have no clue what your VOTING constituents want
@SenateGOP @SenToomey REALLY.  Just like all the other republicans.  How do you sleep at night promoting this LIE
@ElliotGeno @SenToomey @foxandfriends @FoxNews You are right automation takes jobs...and big tax cuts for corporations will streamline and take jobs away...nobody will benefit from these tax cuts but the corporations we will lose jobs
@SenToomey I can't believe you are in with this so called tax reform...although yes I can you were in with the BS health care reform...do you even care about PA residents....what are you getting out of this...smells like NO re-election...HOW DO YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT
