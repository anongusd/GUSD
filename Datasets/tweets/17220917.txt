even if CNN is cynically trying to buy Isgur's contacts list and giving her a sinecure in return, of what use will that contacts list be? won't stories sourced from it be apparent to her? hasn't she already demonstrated that she's mercenary? doesn't that compromise those sources?
this case is so egregious. the plaintiff had to pay a $1,203 fine and go on five years probation/1 year of house arrest for a heroin conviction; Indiana cops thought that was a good excuse to take the brand new Land Rover he'd bought with his late dad's life insurance policy

@carolynfrances5 Britain, which has already refused to repay US debts for WWI, received more US aid than any other European nation and fully 1/3 more than West Germany under the Marshall Plan. 85% of it was straight grant aid.

Not everything should be life or death but if it's life or death for *someone*, maybe we should have the moral imagination to take it more seriously than a debate over which Harry Potter movie is best.
It speaks ill of us to treat all politics as an exercise in which we're just trying to hash out some philosophical differences that don't affect our daily lives. It suggests that our daily lives can't be affected by racism and poverty, and our networks should be larger than that.
Like, I'm going to have a hard time being publicly emotionally supportive of you if people crap on you for, say, assigning Heather Mac Donald to your freshmen. And the reason is that I don't want to alienate and hurt the feelings of the black people I also want to spend time with
I don't know. Be friends with people with bad ideas and opinions, by all means. Support them emotionally when they need it. But there are limits to those friendships, imposed by the possibility of friendship with the people to whose lives they contribute misery and persecution.

Disturbing thing the conductor on this N train just said: ‚ÄúAttention, passengers, we may be making a stop at DeKalb.‚Äù That‚Äôs the next stop and we‚Äôre between stations! Also, this thing is on rails! It should not be difficult to figure out where it‚Äôs going!

My reporting also built on the work of other, better, more sourced-up reporters, especially Tim O‚ÄôBrien and David Cay Johnston, who is an incredibly generous guy.
Some people have given me snide, backhanded credit in their stories, some have omitted my work completely, some have had the common decency to cite me, and many others have built on their own good reporting. But I wanted to say that.
For the record, such as it is: I first reported that Trump was trying to seal a deal for a Moscow tower during his campaign. I first reported that Sater and Cohen were buddies since their teen years, and I profiled Rinat Akhmetshin the day before the Don Jr story broke.
one thing about working on a big story is that you just constantly see your work stolen and repurposed without credit ad infinitum, and it weirdly stays exhausting long after the fact
