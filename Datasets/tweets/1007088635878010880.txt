@former_gop @JenniferWexton @BarbaraComstock @RepComstock Do to you introducing an unrelated topic. Looks like the facts have won. @RepComstock is serving as a check on the president. Contrary to the lies being spread by her opponents.
@former_gop @JenniferWexton @BarbaraComstock @RepComstock @former_gop do recall that the whole reason for a primary challenge was because of lack of support for the president.
@JenniferWexton clearly doesn’t know that the Congress is working to stop the president. The district already has a congresswoman who has stood against the president. Due recall, @BarbaraComstock called on him to drop out after access Hollywood. https://t.co/FVSK4FhD5r

To bad @TheDemocrats @SenSchumer and @JenniferWexton are only using this issue to get elected and don’t care about the children. https://t.co/oJ6pN6kD89
I thought the @TheDemocrats were the party of compassion and helping people. Seems like @SenSchumer is only focusing on the election, rather then the lives of those immigrants. https://t.co/lC4PTlTqva
@RepComstock has released a powerful heartfelt statement and, unlike her opponent, will actually work for immigration reform. https://t.co/7tZxAo8lOU
@TVDArlingtonVA @JenniferWexton @RepComstock I’ll be knocking two hundred for the congresswoman
It was hardly @JenniferWexton who made this happen. @RepComstock has taken a stand for all lives and humane treatment under the law. https://t.co/7tZxAo8lOU
This article fundamentally underestimated the strength of @RepComstock. She is a proven campaigner, a strong leader, and someone who can whether this challenge and continue to represent the people of the 10th district. Not just one group of people. https://t.co/xxvo4VuMg4
