1/3 Re #Kavanaugh There are 6 GOP women Senators. Like many of us they‚Äôve worked hard to  get to their job despite being women not because of it. They're members  of our club of role models for young women who should grow up to follow  their dreams wout feeling shamedor assaulted
1/3 The Vote on #Kanavaugh comes down to whether it is ok for his friends to rush a vote for a guy when legitimate questions about his behavior would make him unfit for that job because ‚Äúno one else saw.‚Äù  MORE investigation is needed. GOP Women, PLEASE STAND UP FOR YOUNG WOMEN.
1/2 It isn‚Äôt fair that the big vote comes down to women having to be ‚Äúwomen‚Äù but it does. It sure does. So this vote on Kavanaugh is no longer about Roe v Wade or LGBTQ or enviro or corp rights, the issues that typically divide women GOP from Dem women, it is about something else
