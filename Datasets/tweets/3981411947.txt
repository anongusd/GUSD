@OrdyPackard @KamalaHarris Yea but Ordy, she's an idiot.
@fiskasaurusrex @stabyoulots @AV_SardonicWaif @LibertyJen @Tamaraw68415067 Yes! I would love to be part of something like this! I'm not worried about the kids. It's older folks like me! Though I'm not that old. But maybe I kinda am... 46
@fiskasaurusrex @stabyoulots @AV_SardonicWaif @LibertyJen @Tamaraw68415067 And I hadn't had to apply for one in so long. It's frustrating to just apply online to some central place and there's no real follow up or writing of notes and stuff like I was taught to do.
@fiskasaurusrex @stabyoulots @AV_SardonicWaif @LibertyJen @Tamaraw68415067 Somebody needs to. I had a career. Nearly 20 years in and I got laid off about a year before the company closed. And I'm not exaggerating when I say I would have happily stayed there until I retired. Started at 25. Then in the Obama economy I couldn't find a job. (1)
@stabyoulots @OrdyPackard @fiskasaurusrex Screw the ghost, leave it out for me. I'll be right there.

@stabyoulots @fiskasaurusrex But why?? Did the bulldozer run out of gas? That's just weird! 😄 The house we lived in when I was in HS was half unfinished, but that half had concrete floors and electricity so at least it wasn't scary basement. Just bare basement. But my folks did it on purpose for a play room
