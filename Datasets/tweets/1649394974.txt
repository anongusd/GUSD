@Tsenzee @JennyEmpressAJB @DailyCaller Lol seriously. Just because the moronic talking heads on CNN say something doesn't make it true. It actually makes people dumber having to listen to it. Keep drinking the kool-aid. People like you have ruined Cali. Good to see the people are trying to take it back
@Tsenzee @JennyEmpressAJB @DailyCaller You could be spoon fed the facts by Comey himself and still would believe it. Why? Because there is a true liberal disease and it's called Trump derangement syndrome and you got it buddy. Hope my we come up with a cure soon cause y'all need help and Jesus
@Tsenzee @JennyEmpressAJB @DailyCaller Where is your proof on Russia? Where's anyone's proof? That's right. There isn't any. Your party tho sure did. Follow the money pal

@Tsenzee @JennyEmpressAJB @DailyCaller Your bio says journalist. Umm if that is what you actually are then get your head out of Hilary's butt and do some actually research. Your talking points are completely lost to any free thinking individual. Try being non-bias for once. This is the very reason I left the D party
@JennyEmpressAJB @Tsenzee @DailyCaller Then you got people like Thom here claiming to be a journalist. Defending Hilary still and wonder why fact news is now a term that we use, believe, and know to be true. Smh
@Tsenzee @JennyEmpressAJB @DailyCaller Do we really need to rehash what everyone already knows is absolute fact. Bleachbit, destruction of servers, destruction of cell phones, tarmac, ect. How is it even possible for you to defend anything H with good conscious?

@RossBarkan No dumbass. The fact the union takes our money and donates it to you dumbasses is our problem. I'm in the union. I absolutely disagree with forcing people into the union and forcing us to pay for it.

Today was an absolute tragedy. I would like to know where all this people that are lashing out about guns stand when it comes to the millions of children murdered every year by planned parenthood. Fooled by the name, planned murder
@kindlysir @marcorubio Are you this passionate about all the dead children planned parenthood has killed this year?
@RepBonamici Agreed. I think we need to look into the psychology of kids social media. I grew up in a time were we were aloud to take guns to school in our vehicles. Nothing like this ever happened and my school was in the least desirable part of my town
@CarmineSabia @hotfunkytown The news said he was born in September. Not saying you info is not correct but there are hundreds of ppl with the same name. I just don't want everyone pointing fingers until facts are solid
@PattyMurray I agree. I'm no expert but I truly believe this type of violence has a lot to do with 24hr news cover and the state of social media making everyone a star for moronic things. Thinks social media needs really looked into and psychology of children using it
@Alyssa_Milano In no way the things that were said even remotely ok. Your constant hatred for people on the conservative side is also hate filled. Everyone needs to be less divisive and we need to figure away to come together
