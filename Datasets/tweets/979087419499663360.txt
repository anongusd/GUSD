@TSnarfler @MSNBC @SteveSchmidtSES One more thing I know: there is one party in this country that has been acting in good faith, telling the truth and asking for investigations into what happened and for $$ and resources to combat further attacks on our democracy. The other party has done everything in its power/1
@TSnarfler @MSNBC @SteveSchmidtSES I agree that no one is protecting us going forward. Congress allocated funds for protection and the Trump administration who should be spearheading the various agencies has done nothing and spent not one dime. That is terrifying.
@TSnarfler @MSNBC @SteveSchmidtSES I also think that it is a very complicated issue &amp;that care must be taken in making the investigation. It wouldn't be tearing the country apart if everyone involved were as quiet &amp;circumspect abt it as Mueller &amp;his team. It is a critical issue that warrants thorough investigation
@TSnarfler @MSNBC @SteveSchmidtSES I agree that the issues of the Russian attack &amp;Trump collusion r 2 separate issues. The conflation of those two ideas is something Trump &amp; others do frequently to muddy the waters. Mueller's mandate is to look at collusion AND to prosecute any other crimes he finds along the way.
@TSnarfler @MSNBC @SteveSchmidtSES though we will soon find out as a judge just ordered Mueller to reveal all five witnesses who rc immunity. Still, Podesta has no relevance to Flynn committing crimes and being prosecuted therefore.
@TSnarfler @MSNBC @SteveSchmidtSES I have no idea what "Flynn charge is a joke in light of Podesta immunity" means. Flynn broke at least 1 law &amp;plead guilty. It was a plea deal, so he clearly broke more than 1 law for which he will not be prosecuted. We don't yet know who was granted immunity in the Manafort trial
@TSnarfler @MSNBC @SteveSchmidtSES Mueller indicted Russian spies for interfering in our election, not for spying. It is clearly the first round. He will move closer to the President and his team as his investigation warrants. U build a house one brick at a time, starting at the bottom &amp;that is what he is doing
Can we please stop calling it the #DailyPressBriefing and call it what it really is: #TheDailyLieFest?

@TSnarfler @MSNBC @SteveSchmidtSES His job isn‚Äôt to ‚Äúcatch‚Äù Trump.

@realDonaldTrump Read The Constitution. The 14the amendment requires you to give everyone their day in court, and the 8th prevents you from doing cruel and unusual things like taking children from those accused of unlawful entry. Dems/Repubs want you to follow our laws. https://t.co/T67gWyPJIy https://t.co/5BqOQkv7Zb

@FoxNews @Comey @IngrahamAngle That‚Äôs rich coming from Trump supporters.
@RepStevenSmith @MichaelCohen212 @McClatchyDC @HillaryClinton You bad. üòä
@chartsweb @RepStevenSmith @MichaelCohen212 @McClatchyDC @HillaryClinton With all due respect, why do you still believe those who tell you Secty Clinton did something nefarious when they‚Äôve told so many lies about her? That poor guy who walked into that pizza place thinking he was saving some kids...they lied then and they are lying to you now
RT @joshrogin: Trump said nothing about Assad's other mass atrocities, including starvation sieges, mass torture and murder of civilians in‚Ä¶
@RepStevenSmith @MichaelCohen212 @McClatchyDC @HillaryClinton Y‚Äôall gotta stop retweeting and liking my response. I‚Äôm super embarrassed that I didn‚Äôt check the account I was responding to. It is clearly a parody account and went off the deep end before I read it thoroughly.
@Gisudaraz @EllieGesiotto @RepStevenSmith @MichaelCohen212 @McClatchyDC @HillaryClinton Oops!! Well that‚Äôs rather embarrassing for me. Goes to show I shouldn‚Äôt read Twitter before my morning coffee...
@RepStevenSmith @MichaelCohen212 @McClatchyDC Rep Smith, you are a member of the United States House of Representatives. Not only is your behavior here not worthy of your station, it was your colleagues who thoroughly and exhaustively investigated @HillaryClinton AND FOUND NOTHING. Shut up about her and do your job!
