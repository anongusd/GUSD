41 states have early voting of some kind. Your campaign neglects it at its own peril. #aopc14
WA, OR, &amp; CO are all-mail ballot states. #aopc14
That said, early voting can really hurt down-ballot candidates. Tough for a state Rep. candidate to reach a voter so far out. #aopc14
Early voting can be especially helpful candidates operating with scarce resources.
Federal law requires that ballots go out to early voters overseas 45 days before an election. #aopc14
In Pinellas County FL, home of one of the state's biggest cities, 80-90% of voters vote early. #aopc14
The Obama campaign targeted voters of all propensities to vote early. And it worked. #aopc14
"You never know what can happen in a campaign." -- @phillipstutts on importance of banking votes early. http://t.co/1AVkbaAoFc
Early voting varies widely from state to state. You've got to know the locality where you're running. "It's essential." #aopc14
No-excuse absentee voting has grown exponentially since 2000. #aopc14
