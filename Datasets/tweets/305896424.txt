@maddow I bet if Obama was still President the report would have been President Obama has single handedly stopped global warming and reversed its effects so much that we are now having record breaking cold weather
@maddow I wonder how the meeting before the show went down when @maddow and her team were thinking of ideas to blame everything on Trump and Russia. If this idea of reporting RUSSIA could take the electric grid down during Trumps cold weather made the show I would love to know what didnt
@maddow The next day @maddow will report breaking news unnamed sources say @realDonaldTrump sent the cold weather into the Northern States to drive illegal immigrants back into Mexico
@maddow Next @maddow will report how @realDonaldTrump and Putin colluded to send cold weather into the US
@maddow Next @maddow will be saying @realDonaldTrump caused the cold weather to help line the pockets of the electric and gas companies and those companies have ties to Russia.
@maddow Russia Russia Russia wow I would love to have a dollar for every time you've said Russia the past 2 years. Leave it to @maddow to figure out how to add a Russia warning into a weather report.
RT @JackPosobiec: Ralph Northam will now be kept comfortable while a discussion ensues
@srosner @GardJohanna @realDonaldTrump @RepAOC Example	MSMBC CNN &amp; FOX run a headline Democrats deny Trump $5b for his wall 	Headline should be Democrats deny $5b for more immigration judges, more ice agents, technology for border security and additional border barriers where ICE sees the need for them
@srosner @GardJohanna @realDonaldTrump @RepAOC And I'm not saying Trump doesn't lie and pander just like all politicians because he does I'm saying the media creates false narratives to boost ratings but it starts rumors and divides the country politics shouldn't be taken out of context especially in today's times
@srosner @GardJohanna @realDonaldTrump @RepAOC Because it's written in black and white in the budget proposal that the $5b is to be used for wall judges immigration officers and technology a sea to sea wall is $20b alone Trump wants the 5b for those things but the media acts like the whole 5b is for the wall read the proposal

@WiseDfs I didn't get my damn picks in in time
@srosner @GardJohanna @realDonaldTrump @RepAOC He isn't asking for all the money to go towards a wall and he not asking for enough to build a wall from sea to sea that would cost 20 billion he's asking for 5 billion and he doesn't want all of it to go towards a wall like the media makes it sound
@srosner @GardJohanna @realDonaldTrump @RepAOC But just think about what you're saying just because Trump made a campaign promise of a wall the dems should fight against him It shouldn't matter campaign or not they should do what's best for America Trump is asking for $5b for wall money judges border agents &amp; technology
@srosner @GardJohanna @realDonaldTrump @RepAOC I remember plainly him doing interviews during the campaign saying you can't build a wall sea to sea now he would say simular sea to sea things during rallies but @CBP wants and say they need a barrier along with technology in strategic places Trump wants $5b for wall and tech

@srosner @GardJohanna @realDonaldTrump @RepAOC His position isn't the wall or nothing he's even came down to just barriers where border security thinks it's necessary and the Dems haven't even came back with a offer except for Pelosi offering $1 Trump has never said wall from sea to sea
@GardJohanna @srosner @realDonaldTrump @RepAOC Our founders intended for divided government and not a simple majority when passing bills I disagree with that I think everything should be at least 60. They set our gov up like this so Congress had to negotiate with each other to do what's best 4 America and not what they want
@GardJohanna @srosner @realDonaldTrump @RepAOC 2/2 with? Nothing at all. Then Trump tried changing it from cement wall to steel slats still no counter then he said build it just in high risk areas still no counter so who's trying to negotiate????
@GardJohanna @srosner @realDonaldTrump @RepAOC The government shut down it's self because Congress didn't pass a budget and Trump said he wasn't signing a budget without border security &amp; wall funding. Trump offered a 3 year extension on DACA after he seen the Dems wouldn't give him the 5b what did the Dems counter 1/2
@WiseDfs @WMPhoenixOpen Thata awesome you're doing golf I love the 4 day ups and downs LOL Lets get some Ws on the board so you can take my money 💰 LOL
@GardJohanna @srosner @realDonaldTrump @RepAOC That's what it's supposed to do that's what our founders intended. I just wish the dems would negotiate Trump has offered stuff they want and asked for a counter offer and they won't negotiate it's their way or no way while Trump is trying to work something out
@NettieDiaz1959 @srosner @realDonaldTrump @RepAOC I don't watch I listen to all 3 of the MSM outlets I listen to FOX CNN and MSNBC daily I listen 2 Maddow and Lawrence everyday believe it or not and yes I am poorly educated but I work everyday for what I have and dont want any handouts from anyone especially the gov and the rich

@jacobsoboroff @MSNBC I'm no Tim the tool guy but what kind of "household saw" can cut through that?

@cabrown08 @RepBarragan @karalynum @avabdc There's no way the congresswoman is walking around with out shoes I bet she had a extra pair just to do that I would like to see a picture of the person's old shoes or bare feet my shoes are probably wore out more than half of the caravans
@RepBarragan Why don't you pan the camera around and let us see what's really going on????
@RepBarragan That was funny you was saying their not letting anyone in and motioned left saying a family was there waiting while @CBP opened the door and let a bunch of people behind u in line in why lie about it if they wait their turn they'll get their chance @CBP can't process all at once

@kyleleehufnagel @KelleyHowes @RepBarragan I tell you what look me up on Facebook I did a video about it a couple months ago when I first started asking people I'll see if I can share the link IDK if I can I don't tweet much but maybe I can figure it out
@kyleleehufnagel @KelleyHowes @RepBarragan What am I making up and whats wrong with helping my community I never saved anyone from a burning building but I was willing to help for 15 years that was 10 years and 200 lbs ago I did help cut a bunch of people out of wrecks though and saved our sheriffs dad's guns from burning
@controlpremium @RepBarragan Why does every immigrant I talk to say don't let them in and even some of the people I've talked to that doesn't want them here came illegal themselves but doesn't want the caravan here the 1 guy said they passed through his mom's town and he said no don't let them in
@kyleleehufnagel @KelleyHowes @RepBarragan On a side note I've talked to a bunch of immigrants the majority of workers that load my truck are immigrants and every one that Ive asked what should the gov do about the caravan says dont let them in one guy said he sends $200 week to family and the caravan stayed in their town
@kyleleehufnagel @KelleyHowes @RepBarragan I'm sure not all of them have homes to go to if the did California wouldn't have such a homeless problem I'm just trying to help IDK why y'all arent
@kyleleehufnagel @KelleyHowes @RepBarragan What???? I'm a little slow you may need to explain that to me in about a 3rd grade level that's about where I'm at so I don't understand what you're talking about
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Im no prosecutor but I'll tell u how hes not acting like a mob boss 4 starters he isnt writing legislation with a phone &amp; pen like our former Pres &amp; not forcing people 2 buy healthcare &amp; pay 4 things they dont want hes trying 2 erase 2 executive orders with every 1 put in place
@kyleleehufnagel @KelleyHowes @RepBarragan So let me get this straight I'm the only conservative here and I'm the only one willing to help? Y'all want to let them in but let someone else take care of them?
@PatriotMike6 I hear ya brother I drive a truck and we're limited to a 70 hour work week and I hit that every week and need more hours yet people complain about 40 SMH #wheresmywhiteprivilege

@kyleleehufnagel @KelleyHowes @RepBarragan Thats halfway right I was a vol firefighter when I was younger whats wrong with that im proud 2 helped my community we cant afford paid firefighters but my hat isnt camo its tan with OOIDA on the front idk what ap is and I do have a big fat head but not wearing Elton John glasses
@kyleleehufnagel @KelleyHowes @RepBarragan I know I'm willing to take a family of immigrants in if y'all are willing but I don't see any volunteers
@kyleleehufnagel @KelleyHowes @RepBarragan What do I know????

@KelleyHowes @kyleleehufnagel @RepBarragan What do you think they were ran out of their homes no they planned to make this trip of course they packed what they wanted they all didn't get ran out of their country at once
@kyleleehufnagel @RepBarragan In the 50s tonight according to Google I'm sure it's not comfortable but they can go back to the shelter and try again tomorrow the parents shouldn't put their children in this situation https://t.co/384Pqu7Siq
@kyleleehufnagel @RepBarragan Never been to the desert maybe it does that far south idk just saying they have t-shirts on. Who's gonna house and feed this family once their here until they can find a job????
@RepBarragan Who is gonna house and feed this family once their here until they can find a job? You don't mention a father so who's gonna watch the kids while mom works? Where is she gonna work that pays enough to support that many kids on her own?
@RepBarragan I  the pics you've shown most people r in t-shirts so it can't be that cold how about a picture of this poor mother and children pics I've seen u post so far they have better clothes and shoes on than me and my kids have my kids shoes are worse than the girls strings frayed

@SenSchumer If @realDonaldTrump builds the wall and secures the border like you also tweeted about doing before Mexico will be indirectly paying for the wall because we won't have to pay for their welfare, legal fees, and spend as much on drug enforcement

@tburages @tedlieu @DonaldJTrumpJr I'll probably watch it I watch or listen everyday but you can say or talk about anything you want it's their right as an elected official it doesn't mean it will go anywhere especially with a Republican controlled house and Senate
@tburages @tedlieu @DonaldJTrumpJr Y'all don't have a clue if he did something illegal I'd be first in line saying impeach but Obama was breaking the law with handing out subsidies 4 ACA Congress can only give money not POTUS by cutting subsidies Trump is following a court ruling
@tburages @tedlieu @DonaldJTrumpJr Maybe you're wording it wrong try saying it's a legislative process to impeach someone instead of saying a political process and I'll buy that
@tburages @tedlieu @DonaldJTrumpJr Abuse of Power and Obstruction of Justice are crimes but if I remember correctly he resigned before impeachment hearings started Bill Clinton and Johnson are the only POTUS ever impeached I think
@tburages @tedlieu @DonaldJTrumpJr Also half of your list isn't crimes even if they were committed but there's no proof of anything on your list I mean wow start impeachment hearings because President Trump Lies 5.5 times a day shoot if that was a crime all of Washington would be impeached
@tburages @tedlieu @DonaldJTrumpJr How could Congress have impeachment hearings on a political statement???
@tburages @tedlieu @DonaldJTrumpJr I'm pretty sure I remember in 7th grade civics class Mr. Altizer taught us that in order for impeachment hearings a high government official has to be accused of major crimes or misdemeanors he taught us its just like an indictment of regular people but this goes through Congress
