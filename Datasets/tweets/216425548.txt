Terry Hartle of ACE opposes having 2 negotiators (AGs + agencies)  representing states on the #negreg. Yet there are EIGHT negotiators representing colleges and three representing accreditors.
Smith: #negreg panel "incredibly imbalanced" against consumer protection. AGs would provide another voice. Hartle of ACE: should be a state voice, but not sure state AGs are that voice.
.@usedgov: State oversight agencies are more appropriate than AGs for these issues. (Yet they were also excluded.)  Now they want on.

Past #negreg panels, even under DeVos/Trump, including several panelists from #ProtectStudentsandTaxpayers coalition and state AGs. This time, though some great people are on panel, only Robyn Smith @NCLC4consumers is such a negotiator.
Ernest McNealy, representing minority-serving schools, asks why #negreg alternates are barred from speaking. ED: TO STREAMLINE because alt reps same constituency. But often alts have a very different viewpoint.
ACE's Terry Hartle says #negreg subcommittee rooms should not be closed to the public (even if livestream (which is not working well, folks are saying) is available). Offers ACE space if ED can't find bigger rooms.  @usedgov says: Too late this week.

Also, Trump is trashing the planet. #ClimateChange https://t.co/Hl4awfukcr

@jarowley I just heard a senior analyst say it on CNN, and I'm sure I've heard it on cable before. It's a contrived attempt to be even-handed, and it's not true. Any responsible senator would want a serious probe of these charges as they've been presented.

I should say that other things, like the immigration restrictions, are also concrete and ugly, but this is a new direction for his authoritarian bullshit.

Tawdy trail, I meant, not tawdry trial. But the predatory colleges are facing a trial. With DeVos's help they are going to try to get back to the glory days, and they will be able to steal a lot more from students &amp; taxpayers, but in the end the crooks will be exposed.
7. It's a great time to be a paid shill, as Trump has thickened the DC swamp &amp; DeVos has given new hope to predatory colleges. But these schools will still fall of their own weight. The public now sees how they rip off students.
6. Then there's the shill army that was dispatched to attack the Obama borrower defense rule, which was aimed to giving debt relief to students abused by predatory colleges.  DeVos is about to dump that rule. https://t.co/KNyWm9INPw
5. They're recruited ex-congressman Allen West to join their ugly anti-student attack. Who is financing this? Unfortunately, if it's #4profit colleges, then we are paying, since many #4profit colleges get 80 or 90 or more % of their revenue from taxpayers. https://t.co/28I0IMbM8X

Interesting tho: ED is requiring DeVry, for now, to comply with its 2016 voluntary commitments: capping ED/VA/DoD funding at 85%; barring forced arbitration; 1-page disclosure to students; recording admissions calls; etc.

ED negreg mediator announces there will be an hour of negotiations closed to public at 9 am Wednesday. Student rep Gannon raises concerns and mediator basically insists. It really doesn't matter at this point. ED has abandoned students. There will be other fora to fight this.

@pages_raul Under the statute, these are student claims that are filed w ED. If ED grants relief, it then has discretion to hold proceeding to recoup from the school. Most #4profits used forced arbitration clauses to prevent students from suing them for anything.

Is the Dept of Education seeing a lot of borrower defense claims from students at public and nonprofit schools? Nope. The borrower defense law is not a scam for crooked students at honest schools; it's protection for honest students at crooked schools. #DefendStudents
Yeah, sounds like a great con. Go to school, put in all your time, personal and family money, private loans, and somehow think it's a great scam to apply to have just your federal loans forgiven and have a chance to get that.

@usedgov No negotiator is saying that all #4profit schools are bad.  But they are talking about bad practices among many in the industry. They should be able to raise that, as well as to comment on particular schools. Industry stance on this is absurd &amp; hypocritical.
#4profit college reps in Trump-era negregs,as in past,got	@usedgov to warn pro-student negotiators not to single out schools for criticism. Now they're complaining that pro-student negotiators are criticizing the entire industry-&amp; they're singling out their own schools for praise
@NCLC4consumers @usedgov I think drafters of these regs figured: Include every barrier to students recovering, and then claim they listened to students when the final rule strips some of them. And/or: if the courts strike down some barriuers, enough will remain to prevent student relief. #defendstudents

ACCSC's McComis: all the high barriers to student relief are "belts and suspenders on pants that are too tight." "I find it just not reasonable that a student would be able to achieve anything... If that's the intent, I'm not sure why we're here."
A negotiator says it sounds like preponderance of evidence standard means that if it's "he said/she said," student wins. Rawles nods, then shakes her head when other negotiators explain 1st negotiator is wrong. Rawles is flatly wrong.
Rawles also says stop focusing on Corinthian--we're in a different world now. Suzanne Martindale of Consumers Union points out California just sued Ashford/Bridgepoint for systematic fraud.  Guess what? Rawles works for Bridgepoint/Ashford. Also, so did DeVos official Bob Eitel.

Linda Rawles, the lawyer for Bridgepoint, notes that she proposed the "clear and convincing" standard
Michale McComis, head of the major #4profit college accreditor ACCSC, says: DeVos Dept proposed borrower defense rule requiring students to meet "clear and convincing" + "intent" + "reckless disregard" -- "feels a little stacked against the student." Hallelujah. #DefendStudents
.@Hubbard_WJ of @studentvets says there is little evidence of students committing fraud but much evidence of #4profit schools committing fraud -- "that's why we're here"
Ashley Harrington of @CRLONLINE says "clear and convincing" standard is roadmap for schools to avoid borrower defense claims
Linda Rawles, who represents awful predatory #4profit Ashford/Bridgepoint says students will understand "clear and convincing" because it's sometimes used in campus disciplinary proceedings.  And some students will bring claims where there is no fraud.
Aaron Lacey, who previously worked at awful predatory #4profit Vatterott College, says clear and convincing standard is cool.  Says we shouldn't get hung up on the notion that this is a legal proceeding.
Shafroth: School, not the student, has all the documentation. Student has no discovery rights, no lawyers. Clear and convincing would effectively do away with borrower relief in almost all circumstances.
Shafroth: Students aren't preserving evidence of deception when they enroll.  They don't think they're being scammed at the time [or else they wouldn't enroll!]
Joseline Garcia of USSA asks @usedgov to walk through how a student without a lawyer can prove borrower defense by clear &amp; convincing evidence? Dept rep says he can't.
@NCLC4consumers @usedgov Dept certainly should reevaluate -- why should such a heavy and unusual standard be placed on struggling students?  Would only do that to stack the deck in favor of predatory schools.
Abby Shafroth of @NCLC4consumers: Why is @usedgov demanding students prove right to loan relief by "clear and convincing" evidence standard? Dept: normal standard doesn't protect interests of schools &amp; taxpayers sufficiently, but Dept "can certainly reevaulate" #defendstudents

It was debated at the negreg, and the Dept reps ultimately did not stop livestream.  That is precedent.  DeVos team had a year to address this and didn't. Default should be freedom and openness. https://t.co/iXEBRJZGTx
.@cmadaio of MD AG says vote should have to be unanimous for BARRING livestream, after facilitator says it would require unainimous vote to ALLOW livestreaming. Again, in America, default should be freedom and openness.
#4profit college reps on @usedgov #studentloans negreg seem all to be arguing against public live-streaming of a public meeting. Why are they so opposed to the public watching what is going on?
@EduCounsel @usedgov Surprising to public and undoubtedly some negotiators that in our country you would think the default position, in the absence of a rule, that the public cannot make video of a public meeting.
Laureate negotiator also asks that negotiators not tweet or retweet. Says meetings not bound by FACA law. Again opposes livestream.
Livestreaming was ultimately permitted at 2016 negreg. DeVos @usedgov had the whole year to try to block that from future negregs. There is no rule now, Default should be openness - allow livestreaming.
Laureate #4profit rep opposes livestreaming because there was no notice &amp; because "this is not a public hearing, it's a negotiation."  SHE ADDS, I have learned this is being livestreamed. Facilitator: SHUT IT DOWN. @maggiekthompson defends livestream. Facilitor SHUTS DOWN MEETING
.@cmadaio MD AG office -- @usedgov may not be livestreaming, but why stop the public from livestreaming this public meeting?
Consumer negotiator Whitney Barkley: livestream would help the public follow this public meeting. @usedgov: Dept not averse to livestreaming, but there was no notice of that, so NO. #defendstudents
Facilitator for @usedgov rule-making: "There will be no live-streaming here, but we are recording" and audio will be made available later. #defendstudents
