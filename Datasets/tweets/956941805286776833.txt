@ntlatlapa Fantastic, you have a client for December braai, that’s me 😃
Piggery business is one of those undermined by youth, production is so low on this which makes me wonder; so much Pork that is consumed every year during festive season at various parties, where is it coming from? Whose business are we supporting? Whom are we creating jobs for?
1) Year end parties at Government Departments, who foots that Bill? 		2) Let’s pretend that we know the bill is paid from the Public purse, accountants at such Ministries how do you record this, probably as allowances or miscellaneous?		3) Internal Auditors and controls....

@thakanenglppa @TsepoThibankhoe @thakanenglppa o e qetile!
Sometimes; Workshops and conferences meant to discuss youth unemployment, happen to be the reason why we have unemployment in the first place. This says the problem is not unemployment, the problem is attending a problematic event organised by our problematic events organizers.
Economic reforms undergoing at Victoria Hotel, in Maseru Lesotho, happen to be representing the youth on such panel. @ntlatlapa @ntateRaps @WMD85620400 @ChapterSaaye @SADC_News @Lestimes https://t.co/EJiWWRRRVU
@TsepoThibankhoe @ntlatlapa @MMokotjo50 @WMD85620400 @ChapterSaaye From the perspective of youth I can safely reply with a “Yes” there were representatives from the likes of Bo-Monna ka Khomo.
When Such happens 40% of the youth populace, unemployment is reaching its peak at around 34.4% #100% salary increments must fall! 		Glad to see even members of Youth Leagues joining Youth Civil Society Organisations in this protest @ChapterSaaye @MMokotjo50 @ntlatlapa @WMD8562040
While being richer than the country with interest free 500k loans, massive allowances, Lesotho parliamentarians demand 100% increase on salaries, they also have the audacity to discuss economic reforms which were previously and deliberately sidelined in the Reforms Roadmap. https://t.co/tUumZl876b
