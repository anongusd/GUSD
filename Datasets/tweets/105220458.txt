@SenatorCollins are you freaking kidding me. You know Kavanagh is going to reverse Roe versus Wade. If you have any distinct respect for women you will refuse this recognition now. You just another corporate democratic Republican? If you don't stand for women.

@dougducey For all those slave wages. We can thank all of the Arizona taxpayers for subsidizing the lack of sufficient pay in benefits which they are forced to apply for because they can't make a living wage. You chose not to mention those other issues though. Not surprising.
@dougducey That's so wonderful... Maybe they could start paying a livable wage for all those wonderful fabulous jobs your exploiting here. Or could we call it slave wages... Yeah I think maybe we can.

@CityofKingman I am so disappointed in this response. I've lived here 25 years and the majority of this community are beautiful people... but it's common knowledge that we have serious issues and this empty rhetoric doesn't help this community one single bit.
I am completely disappointed in this response. Some of the best people on earth live here in Kingman Arizona. Not facing the issues that most of us are very well aware exist does not move our community forward nor promote local businesses.  #AZsaysNOtoHate https://t.co/RB0r9P0YtO
@DailyMiner I've been here 25 years and I've met some of the best people I've ever known. Having said that it is common knowledge that we have serious issues with white supremacy, racism and bigotry. It has been allowed to destroy the very fabric of what we could be as a community.
@DailyMiner Seriously, a totally evasive and empty response to a very serious and dangerous problem that we here in Kingman Arizona deal with each and every day of our Lives.
@adamcbest To the communities detriment the leaders here appear to be trying to convince all of us that this was all staged. The problem is too many people have told me that they recognize many of the faces in the segment. It's a shame that they do not lead the people to a better phase.
@adamcbest I have lived in Kingman for 25 years. There are some really great people and businesses here. The fact is though that our community has been pushed deeper into its own racism and bigotry by MAGA. The racist rants by Trump has emboldened some of the worst.
Pompeo is not answering the questions. That's the bottom line.

As a independent voter I have tried hard to only vote for those I felt qualified. We must however think about which party consistently supports inhumanity, cruelty, racism and bigotry.
Since we're on the subject of clarification . @dougducey @JeffFlake  @SenJohnMcCain @RepAndyBiggsAZ    why are you not acting on the serious crisis of child abuse that's going on within our state concerning migrant children being incarcerated for the prophet of Corporations?
Let's get something straight #Arizona. @RepAndyBiggsAZ Clarify in writing, right here, right now your stance on a woman's right to choose what happens to her physical body. Abortion, control over her reproductive system whatever you would like to call it. Clarify that to us now.
Let's get something straight #Arizona... @dougducey Clarify in writing, right here, right now your stance on a woman's right to choose what happens to her physical body. Abortion, control over her reproductive system whatever you would like to call it. Clarify that to us now.
@romyreiner Young lady, you are so right on about this. Do not pay attention to condemners. Stand strong, you're on the right track. I'm old and maybe halfway freaking wise, I don't know you'd have to ask my son for he probably tell you I'm not. LOL. But keep on girl keep on
@RepAndyBiggsAZ @DailyCaller @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Arizona is simply not going to stand for those politicians that are bought and paid for by fossil fuels and ignore the needs, the basic needs of the people of this state. You are one of those.
@RepAndyBiggsAZ @DailyCaller @POTUS @realDonaldTrump OMG... I had to reread this because it shows a total blind following of idiocy, inhumanity, bigotry, racism and the silliness to do anything to get elected to pursue power and profit. I'm just tired of it as a citizen of Arizona. Seriously, I'm tired of it.
@SGLandy82 @RepAndyBiggsAZ @DailyCaller @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I think it would be appropriate for Andy Biggs to clarify what his stance is on a woman's right to choose what happens to her own physical body? Let's put it on the record like right now. Because I think it's really important.
@SteveWeichert @RepAndyBiggsAZ @DailyCaller @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I truly believe that we in Arizona are intelligent people. We are capable of research and assessing what is really going on around us. Let's stop the nonsense and realize who is really representing us. If they're not representing us then both them out.
@SteveWeichert @RepAndyBiggsAZ @DailyCaller @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I've been asking this question for a long time... As an independent voter I wonder who is it that's representing me in the state of Arizona. Because it's not Andy Biggs... doesn't the oath of office require these representatives to represent each and every one of us.
I have to tell you #ARIZONA, it doesn't matter which party you are a member of because the bottom line is that we we stand for something. We're in the middle of so many crises that we can't keep them straight. Let's take the blinders off and examine what we're going to do now.
I do not normally forward inconsequential data or articles like this written by a totally delusional representative of Arizona. Having said that I think you should read this. Because #ARIZONA deserves to know who represents them. It's disgraceful and problematic. https://t.co/Ys0TqLwlw8
@RepAndyBiggsAZ The fact is that they are requesting documents that show corruption. Do you think that any one of us would have access to the research and documents that implied that we were doing something illegal? Think about it.
@RepAndyBiggsAZ @ShannonBream @foxnewsnight OMG... Seriously fellow arizonans check your research and the details of what this guy is is saying and doing because it's just not effective nor accurate. We are all decent people, we know BS from reality. We are all paying attention.
@RepAndyBiggsAZ Pay attention Arizona because you need to really read the fine print on all of these because it's b*******.
Each and everyone of you have power. You may not think you do. But you do. You have the rights and freedoms to speak out and express what you really think. I mean what you really think. What you feel in your heart and soul. Just do it because it really makes a difference.
As much as I had hoped different. @dougducey doesn't give a s*** about the majority of us. He only represents a base, a small base that is filled with hatred, bigotry and racism. Let's just stop all of this. Vote him out.
@azcapmedia @dougducey Each and every one of us as average Arizona citizens and voters are expected to abide by the laws. Do we really think that elected officials should be not responsible for the same things we are?
@ellievan65 @YouTube He's not answering the questions as usual... Grandstanding, trying to use the media to put his b******* out there. It's called testimony. It's called testimony...he is supposed to answer the questions. He simply does not.

Today at this moment in time there is never been more of a need in our entire history of the United States where impeachment is not necessary. And it needs to be done as quickly as possible.
OMG... The #PaulRyan news conference is off with a bang... The spin is in. The intro is all about how fabulous we Americans are doing economically.... She hasn't been to my neighborhood then.
@ananavarro The majority of Americans have been put in the position of knowing in our hearts that this man is INHUMANE and discusting. We have been forced to feel a hatred of sorts based on the fact that we are HUMANE and hatred hurts all our souls no matter how appropriate. #Trump is sick!

Hey guys, don't even tune in at 9 tonight for the #Trump #supremecourtpick fiasco... He only cares about ratings and quite frankly we already know he's trying to f*** #WomensRights over in general. So seriously... #TurnOffTrump.
