@Wally52world @tommyweberbball @KanzlerThinks Lol fair enough :)
@Wally52world @tommyweberbball @KanzlerThinks I do not believe I am the exception to the rule.  I believe the delusional parents are the louder squeakier wheels. I believe there are a few of these types on each and every team but they are not the majority.  They‚Äôre the headache. I get it. But not majority.
@Wally52world @tommyweberbball @KanzlerThinks Jason - ^^^this is the stereotype I am talking about...I disagree.  There are a lot of us parents that are not delusional about our child‚Äôs ability and who do not believe in participation trophies...!
@KanzlerThinks Gotcha - It comes across differently - to me anyways - like Tommy tweeted about the over involved parent...they give all parents a bad name cuz they‚Äôre the loudest most vocal helicopter types - so ‚Äúno parent involvement‚Äù to me implies we‚Äôre a hinderance. I‚Äôm 100% or free play
@tommyweberbball @KanzlerThinks I don‚Äôt disagree.  The correlation between loving supportive involved parents and healthy successful children is also well documented.

@KanzlerThinks 3/3:  My comment is constructive and I will reiterate it again - some of us are nothing like the stereotype you accuse us of being.
@KanzlerThinks 2/3:You made it to minor leagues. When you tweet about parents in a negative way - as if we are a hindrance - are you speaking of ur own parents - who I would guess had a significant/positive role in ur baseball career.
@KanzlerThinks 1/1: I know ur a parent. How old are your kids? Have you guided them successfully thru HS college teen years and young adulthood yet? Have you helped them navigate through athletics yet?
@KanzlerThinks The common theme of how much you detest parents in your tweets is insulting.  Some of us are not anything like the stereotype you continue to accuse us of being!
