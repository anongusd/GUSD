Thinking of @KentOgle as I take the hotel shampoo before my flight.
The Emmy's reminded me of all the TV I lost, with little good new ones, and the good ones aren't awarded.
The only highlight of my night has been Craig was included in the go away tribute. #Emmys2015

So you used #AmyPoehler for the outro tease to stay tuned, but didn't give her the award? #Emmys2015  Totally makes sense @TelevisionAcad
Ok, I think she is funny but I am SO over this. Amy Poehler deserved that. #Emmys2015
#LorneMichaels #SNL creator deserves that mug like no other. #Emmys2015
For best comedy series I will accept #ParksandRec or #UnbreakableKimmySchmidt in #Emmys2015
I hope #AmyPoehler wins lead actress for comedy series in #Emmys2015 . Among AMAZING nominees.
@MelBrooks needs to win something. He is a legend. #Emmys2015
#ParksandRec better win something or I protest next #Emmys
#SNL40 will probably win something.
I wish @MelBrooks would have won best guest appearance, but that's the #Emmys for you.
I want Titus Burgess to win supporting actor for Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.
I just w#ant Parks to get an award and Kimmy to get an award. #TheEnd #Emmys
So yeah I just read that #ConaninCuba lost to #Colbert . As much as I love Colbert, the #ConaninCuba episode was hard to make AND AMAZING.
Well #ConaninCuba was nominated but it's up against goodbye to Colbert. #Emmys #shit
I really hoped that Mayim Balik or Jane Krasowski won, but she was amazing in Mom, even though the series is kind of eh to me.

I have never seen a girl feel uncomfortable about this unless it was the first date and he was a NO.
To me that's not ownership, it's a guy trying to be nice. I'm a feminist. But I love when I see a guy putting his arm around a girl.
Putting your arm around a girl is a nice way to show affection without being too on top of her or gross pda. #HelenMirren

@malinky2stoatir Lasally picked @CraigyFerg even though his test run wasn't the best, because he said, he knew he would watch him.
@malinky2stoatir And isn't Peter Lasally quitting? And I feel like he knew how good Craig was, I heard a rare podcast with him.
@malinky2stoatir So I don't really hold it against them that they spend more money on these things.
@malinky2stoatir But as for the publicity side, for some reason I think Craig never really wanted them to publicize him too much.
@malinky2stoatir I just have found that CBS never recognizes anyone who is different, they like to play it safe. Which is not very Craig.
@malinky2stoatir I am upset, but you know, I don't really hold it against CBS. They were idiots sure.
Just realized,11 didn't think he had any more regenerations, so why would he call Clara? I like Matt, but him in Deep Breath-not needed.

@V_Good3 also other drivers confirmed that Tony tried to avoid him. No pro driver wants to kill anyone. Kind of bad on the career.
@quadre_ @V_Good3 no but the report says he was so high it probably was the reason he disobeyed the rules and headed to the car.
@V_Good3 I am saying he did try to avoid him but the kid came out of the car and was going toward him.

@SurvivingJack I also love it. But it's also the theme song thing.
Like all good TV shows, I kind of want to keep @SurvivingJack because the theme song is AMAZING.
Tumblr user pizza just followed me on Tumblr. I really have made it. But ???????????????????

He helped me form my dream. I am rambling like a deluded idiot, but that's what he did to me, he made me happy. #FarwellFerguson
I had a relapse in middle school, I was about to do something really bad..but I decided to watch Craig Ferguson instead. You will be missed.
Ok. Now that I got all that out of my system....I knew that was coming and I will always love and respect @CraigyFerg
The only way I accept your resignation @CraigyFerg is if you have some kind of reunion planned with Capaldi!!!!!!!!
I am NOT OK.
@CraigyFerg I don't even know what to say. You helped me get over depression. And now that you are leaving, I feel that pain in my heart.
I am not going to stop tweeting all night. Because @CraigyFerg has left the @LateLateShowCBS . I may never watch late night tv again.
I want to hear the "stroke story" from @carlreiner . Is it on YouTube? Btw, Carl, "My Anecdotal Life" is great!

@bgrhubarb This is the network that brought us 2 1/2 Men. Girls should not feel shame about their penguins.
@bgrhubarb Although it is amazing how television won't let him say anything about "penguins". So penises are OK but vaginas are not?
@michaelnaidus I blame you for why guys are so ignorant. I want my guy to know to give me a penguin.
@michaelnaidus I WANT MY PENGUIN!

@bgrhubarb called what?
@CraigyFerg I told your fans on Tumblr they were discovered and no one believed me! I am not embarrassed of my fangirl. Or my fan videos.
@bgrhubarb it also kind of says he is going to fail before he gets there which is dumb to say before he is given a chance. It's a year away!
@bgrhubarb please tell me you don't believe this.
@VDOOZER @CraigyFerg has said he didn't want to take David Letterman's slot so why is this suddenly a case of backstabbing?
@VDOOZER and as a journalist, you are right! We have no clue yet! I am also getting tired of people trying to make drama with @CraigyFerg.
@VDOOZER well I think it is risky if they didn't talk too much about what his audience will expect and what cbs expects.
@VDOOZER I have spent almost 15 minutes trying to word my congratulations on the renewal of Ground Floor to you and @JohnCMcGinley
@kendalltreece YIKES. I met the Hargis' today and yesterday and they are SO sweet. No one hates. The people at OSU are AH-MA-ZING!

RT @VDOOZER: Others using this to tell me how much Season 9 sucked.  Glad we get to revisit (not really). Look, I don't think 9 was Scrubs,‚Ä¶
@VDOOZER literally had this conversation with a friend. Glad you agree-spinoff. Even different network.
Although I did also like @frandrescher 's The Nanny ending.
The #HIMYMFinale taught me that the only modern sitcom where the end is good-Scrubs. I will be watching all of @VDOOZER 's shows this year.
@thelizabethv right?
The #HIMYMFinale felt like watching Ross go back to his lesbian wife.
@zachbraff @VDOOZER true but no one is kidding. I liked scrubs. Watched it 8x but #himym was unfair to viewers. Never watching even reruns.
@jdavhill but they should have changed the end bc that ending was designed for a two season show. Not a show that gives heartfelt moments.
@jdavhill I hate how all of the critics are giving race reviews when the fans are pissed. I see maybe a bit of what they were doing.
@jdavhill saw your article.You are telling me I missed the point? No I saw the so called point but that ending was the worst written thing.
So apparently @carlreiner is going to be on @CraigyFerg talking to @DrewFromTV . Best April Fools Day.

@tvdotcom worst finale ever.
RT @Naive_Steve: petition to make HIMYM mean "to irreversible mess something up"? "dude, i just HIMYM'd this test"
@TVGuide The worst final I have ever seen. Thought I loved it more than that but they blew it so bad, they weren't even nice people.
Do you think the writers got their dates messed up and thought this was April fools? #HIMYMFinale
At least they gave us closure. It was so bad nobody wants to talk about it again.
The last time I called my dad after a finale was @bbcdoctorwho "journey's end" so yeah this is literally ice cream time. #HIMYMFinale #cry
Literally anger walking. This is worse than if the series would have ended two seasons ago. #himym
