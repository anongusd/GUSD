"Licenses are particularly important for workers in key agricultural areas, such as San Miguel County, where public transportation is not readily available. Our agriculture industry, which in 2014 alone contributed $2.8B to CO's GDP, is heavily reliant on immigrant labor (35%).
"As a whole in 2014, our state’s immigrant workers also paid more than $3.9 billion in taxes and carry $12.1 billion in spending power. These contributions would only increase if access to licenses were expanded."

"Immigrants help power major sectors of [Colorado's] economy, driving innovation, creating jobs &amp; boosting economic growth. In our Congressional District, immigrants make up over 12 percent of the tourism workforce, &amp; that number is higher in resort communities like Telluride."
"Increased funding would mean more qualified and insured drivers, safer roads, and lower insurance premiums for everyone."
"Although originally allowing undocumented immigrants to apply and obtain licenses from six DMV locations, that number has since dwindled, and could become just one if funding to properly implement the program as intended isn’t provided."

More licenses means greater safety for all New York residents on the road because drivers can pass a variety of written knowledge and road tests, become licensed and purchase insurance.		More via @FWDus https://t.co/uN3XnRjKhp
** BONUS ** 		@FiscalPolicy00 also projects the measure will generate:		$8.6M in annual revenues 		AND		$2.2M in one-time revenue for the MTA from surcharges on car registration, gas tax, and sales tax, and driver’s licenses within the greater metropolitan area.
According to a 2017 study by @FiscalPolicy00, New York would:		• Add 265K new drivers		• Add $57M a yr revenue w/ a one-time revenue windfall of $26M		• Get $24M in one-time revenue from license plate + title fees		• $28M a year from car registration fees + gas &amp; sales taxes
Twelve other states, in addition to Washington DC and Puerto Rico, currently permit undocumented residents to obtain driver’s licenses, with additional states poised to adopt similar policies
“New York thrives when it supports policies that build a vibrant, inclusive, welcoming environment for immigrants of all backgrounds.,” said Eddie A. Taveras, New York State Immigration Manager for @FWDus
By permitting undocumented residents to apply for a standard driver’s license, #NewYork State would realize more than $57 million in annual revenue and an additional one-time windfall of $26 million

“Because of actions of the Trump Administration, more than one million people who are legally living and working across our nation are at risk of being ripped out of their jobs and communities. Congress needs to get to work.”
“The new Congress needs to get to work on day one to do exactly that, starting by dealing with the urgent crisis facing Dreamers and TPS holders who have been contributing to the United States for decades.”
2️⃣ Is it because deporting Dreamers or slashing legal immigration are bigger priorities to the President and his advisors than border security?
1️⃣ Why did the White House reject four different bipartisan solutions that would have actually provided funding to build the wall?

I don't have an announcement regarding ”whats next” at the moment, I wanted to ensure folks knew that I will remain at the intersection of #immigration and tech/online. 		There's to a of work ahead of us and a significant need for POC/impacted ppl to lead.
I will forever be grateful to @FrankSharry for taking a chance on me and allowing me to develop my skills. From collecting 500,000 petition signature to get Trump off @nbcsnl to raising $37K for a family in need - I've kept true to my values and worked hard to help others.
While my time at @AmericasVoice may come to an end, I am reminded of all the opportunities @FrankSharry, @tramontela, @maribelhastings, and other provided me throughout my 3-year tenure.		I became stronger, wiser, and learned a LOT from what I always considered my dream job.
A quick, but significant personal update -&gt;		I am currently transitioning out of my role @AmericasVoice. For the past several months I have been in conversations w/ several folks on how to diligently and effectively advance #immigration issues through digital platforms.
