@utdreport 😭😭
@SibsMUFC Our failure isn’t related to Jose only, and Spurs progress isn’t related to Pochettino. The main factor is management mentality
@UtdAIii This the quality of players we have, don’t talk again to play Fred, pogba and perrera again, only you can in fifa
@SimplyUtd Simply five years with zero trophy, Jose didn’t have money in Porto and Inter but achieved great trophies. He isn’t suitable for us.
@mufcszn Happy Dreams 😂
@SibsMUFC He will do better when we have excellent CBs
@utdxtra He will do better when we have excellent CBs
@MourinhoMindset I suggest him to sign in smalling and Jones 😂😂
This is a message for the board, special one 😂😂 https://t.co/l5DwTJYWhD
@brighthenry27 @utdxtra He will be valuable to us when he realizes that he is one from our team and he isn’t greater than our club
@utdxtra We are better without him
@AidanWalshMUFC Exactly true
@LiamPaulCanning And without pogba
@SSIIIIUUUU @IamRahulR8 @UtdAIii What you think if pichettino come to us and working with our defense and poor pogba and lukaku? Can he achieve the second as Jose did
@SSIIIIUUUU @IamRahulR8 @UtdAIii Inter and Madrid not 10 years, 3 trophies with us in the first year also not 10 years
@utdxtra Please Pogba out he hasn’t any loyalty to our club
