There is nothing more dreadful than the habit of doubt. Doubt separates people. It is a poison that disintegrates friendships and breaks up pleasant relations. It is a thorn that irritates and hurts; it is a sword that kills.

To keep the body in good health is a duty… otherwise we shall not be able to keep our mind strong and clear.
To enjoy good health, to bring true happiness to one’s family, to bring peace to all, one must first discipline and control one’s own mind. If a man can control his mind he can find the way to Enlightenment, and all wisdom and virtue will naturally come to him.
The mind is everything. What you think you become.
Your purpose in life is to find your purpose and give your whole heart and soul to it.
You can search throughout the entire universe for someone who is more deserving of your love and affection than you are yourself, and that person is not to be found anywhere. You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection.
Not all storms come to disrupt your life, some come to clear your path.
Stuff.

A man is not called wise because he talks and talks again; but if he is peaceful, loving and fearless then he is in truth called wise.
Better than a thousand hollow words, is one word that brings peace.
In a controversy the instant we feel anger we have already ceased striving for the truth, and have begun striving for ourselves.

If you are willing to do more than you are paid to do, eventually you will be paid to do more than you do.
Opportunities don't happen. You create them.
Stop chasing the money and start chasing the passion.
Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life--think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success.
If you are not willing to risk the usual, you will have to settle for the ordinary.
Things work out best for those who make the best of how things work out.
Success usually comes to those who are too busy to be looking for it.

There are two types of people who will tell you that you cannot make a difference in this world: those who are afraid to try and those who are afraid you will succeed.
Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.
The starting point of all achievement is desire.
If you want to achieve excellence, you can get there today. As of this second, quit doing less-than-excellent work.
All progress takes place outside the comfort zone.
Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear--not absence of fear.
Only put off until tomorrow what you are willing to die having left undone.
We become what we think about most of the time, and that's the strangest secret.
The key to failure is trying to please everyone.
Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.
The No. 1 reason people fail in life is because they listen to their friends, family &amp; neighbors.
in·de·pend·ent	ˌindəˈpendənt		adjective:		free from outside control; not depending on another's authority		synonyms:		freethinking, free, individualistic, not depending on another for livelihood or subsistence, self-sufficient/supporting/reliant, standing on one's own two feet
The first step toward success is taken when you refuse to be a captive of the environment in which you first find yourself.
Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.
The successful warrior is the average man, with laser-like focus.
Keep on going, and the chances are that you will stumble on something, perhaps when you are least expecting it. Never heard of anyone ever stumbling on something sitting down.
If you genuinely want something, don't wait for it--teach yourself to be impatient.
You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something--your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.
Successful people do what unsuccessful people are not willing to do. Don't wish it were easier; wish you were better.
There is only one motivation, and that is desire. No reasons or principle contain it or stand against it.
Success does not consist in never making mistakes but in never making the same one a second time.

re·li·a·ble	rəˈlīəb(ə)l/		adjective	1.	consistently good in quality or performance; able to be trusted.	synonyms:	dependable, good, well founded, authentic, valid, genuine, sound, true 		noun	1.	a person or thing with trustworthy qualities.
Motivation is what gets you started. Habit is what keeps you going.
Our greatest fear should not be of failure ... but of succeeding at things in life that don't really matter.
Nobody ever wrote down a plan to be broke, fat, lazy, or stupid. Those things are what happen when you don't have a plan.
To be successful you must accept all challenges that come your way. You can't just accept the ones you like.
You may have to fight a battle more than once to win it.
Be content to act, and leave the talking to others.
Be patient with yourself. Self-growth is tender; it's holy ground. There's no greater investment.
Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up.
The greater the artist, the greater the doubt. Perfect confidence is granted to the less talented as a consolation prize.
What would you attempt to do if you knew you would not fail?
Always bear in mind that your own resolution to success is more important than any other one thing.
Successful and unsuccessful people do not vary greatly in their abilities. They vary in their desires to reach their potential.
Double your rate of failure. You are thinking of failure as the enemy of success. But it isn't at all. You can be discouraged by failure or you can learn from it, so go ahead and make mistakes. Make all you can. Because remember that's where you will find success.
Success is just a war of attrition. Sure, there's an element of talent you should probably possess. But if you just stick around long enough, eventually something is going to happen.
A truly strong person does not need the approval of others any more than a lion needs the approval of sheep.
As we advance in life it becomes more and more difficult, but in fighting the difficulties the inmost strength of the heart is developed.
You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have.
Few men during their lifetime come anywhere near exhausting the resources dwelling within them. There are deep wells of strength that are never used.
Nothing can dim the light which shines from within.
I was always looking outside myself for strength and confidence, but it comes from within. It is there all the time.
Life is not about waiting for the storms to pass. It’s about learning how to dance in the rain.
No matter what kind of challenges or difficulties or painful situations you go through in your life, we all have something deep within us that we can reach down and find the inner strength to get through them.
You have power over your mind, not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.
Few things in the world are more powerful than a positive push. A smile. A world of optimism and hope. A 'you can do it' when things are tough.
Never give up on what you really want to do. The person with big dreams is more powerful than the one with all the facts.
When you look into an abyss, the abyss also looks into you.
Some things scratch the surface while others strike at your soul.
I want to be like water. I want to slip through fingers, but hold up a ship.
The world as we have created it is a process of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking.
There can be no deep disappointment where there is not deep love.
I think you have to know who you are. Get to know the monster that lives in your soul, dive deep into your soul and explore it.
This life is like a swimming pool. You dive into the water, but you can’t see how deep it is.
Every human walks around with a certain kind of sadness. They may not wear it on their sleeves, but it’s there if you look deep.
Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better.
The human body is the best picture of the human soul.

The insecurity of your enemies, will build your castle &amp; make you wealthy.
La jalousie libère la colère et la colère est le plus grand et l'ultime ennemi qui peut déterminer votre jugement pour toujours et finalement retenir votre destin.
Never hate people who are jealous of you, but respect their jealousy because they’re the ones who think you’re better than them.
What is the root of evil? Desire is the root of evil, illusion is the root of evil.
Be so good that they can't ignore you.
Haters hate because they hate themselves, see us as a threat, want to be us, project their life’s failures on us, are cruel heartless bullies, suffer untreated mental illnesses, are jealous envious loners, hypocritical twats that purchases love &amp; happiness instead of being real.

You will never influence the world by trying to be like it.
True meditation is about being fully present with everything that is–including discomfort and challenges. It is not an escape from life.
The body is your temple. Keep it pure and clean for the soul to reside in.
Give this world good energy.
Inhale the future. Exhale the past.
Most people have no idea how good their body is designed to feel.
When you listen to yourself, everything comes naturally. It comes from inside, like a kind of will to do something. Try to be sensitive.
I was looking for someone to inspire me, motivate me, support me, keep me focused… Someone who would love me, cherish me, make me happy, and I realized all along that I was looking for myself.
That’s why it’s called a practice. We have to practice a practice if it is to be of value.

Take care of your body, it’s the only place you have to live.
The future depends on what we do in the present.
Do not feel lonely.  The entire universe is inside of you.
Inner peace begins the moment you choose not to allow another person or event to control your emotions.
Your body can do it.  It’s your mind you need to convince.
A flower does not think of competing to the flower next to it.  It just blooms.
You cannot always control what goes on outside, but you can always control what goes on inside.
The universe does this thing… where it aligns you with people, things, and situations that match the energy you put out.  The more you improve yourself and raise your vibration, the more you will see things that are beneficial to your well-being.

A dog has one aim in life… to bestow his heart.
It is under the greatest adversity that there exists the greatest potential for doing good, both for oneself and others.
Almost every sinful action ever committed can be traced back to a selfish motive. It is a trait we hate in other people but justify in ourselves.
It’s that wonderful old-fashioned idea that others come first and you come second. This was the whole ethic by which I was brought up. Others matter more than you do, so ‘don’t fuss, dear; get on with it.
Our prime purpose in this life is to help others. And if you can’t help them, at least don’t hurt them.
The is power is self-sacrifice.

No need for fake friends or acquaintances. No time wasted on playing around either. Focus on making money &amp; acquiring knowledge nonstop. Prepare for losing true friends &amp; few of your bloodline along the way as usually they’re the ones to turn on you when you expect it the least.
No one &amp; nothing can define or judge you but yourself.
Look at your body, I mean, literally take the time to pay attention to EVERY single square inch of it: THIS IS YOU; perfectly flawed! Your heart’s temple guarding its beats &amp; soul’s method of transportation on this strange earth but most importantly learn to TREASURE &amp; LOVE it.
The harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.
Things may come to those who wait, but only the things left by those who hustle.

I was once told by a very wise old soul that the solution to most troubles between two people can be resolved by simply fucking it out of your system.
Living in the past is like pressing down a self-destruct button on purpose. Worse is replaying what once was over &amp; over &amp; over again in your head while it pushes you even farther away from the present &amp; anybody in it but sadly you’ll also never catch up to the future either.
Embracing every breath is essential, not to ever be taken for granted.

If on your quest to total happiness you keep following unwanted guidance, bother listening to irrelevant advices or opinions, influencing your every move based on other’s gossips &amp; judgment calls about your life, you will have failed to grasp the quintessence of being free.

So bullying is still a thing, racism, free hate &amp; unnecessary violence too… feels like most of humanity is moving on backward in my opinion.
Time is an exciting theory.

When it rains, how do you not get too wet⁉️🧐
Nothing is worth losing yourself for.
Sometimes jealousy isn’t because of what you have materialistically. They envy your intelligence, how others love you, show love to you &amp; have love for you. People envy the way you handled a situation or what they thought would have broken you, but didn’t. Long live the haters.
They need to talk about you to get attention, because if they spoke about themselves no one would give a fuck.
