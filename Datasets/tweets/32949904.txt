@bernielomax @CloakedJester @glenn_schwoyer @AOC If you don't understand how mortgages are bundled, bought, and sold as a commodity, please don't comment on this subject as if you do.
@CloakedJester @bernielomax @AOC You have no idea how this works, do you. By easing using insufficient underwriting requirements, that caused loans to be approved that should not have been. This is directly tied to government policy.
@bernielomax @CloakedJester @AOC These were government programs that set the stage for excessive lending. And government set the underwriting guidelines. It was not brought about by deregulation.
@bernielomax @CloakedJester @AOC Yeah I blamed the housing policy initiatives that started under George W Bush you tribal dipshit.
@cazidog @cpk289 @AOC SSDI is the safety net
@DanielTKeller2 @danloughmiller @onlykindofbrave @TravisPrebble @cpk289 @AOC I'm not sure why everybody is so stuck in building regulations in this thread. There is a big difference between safety codes and overly restrictive zoning regulations.
@QConteret @AOC Lol you don't even know me
@splurben @AOC Not talking about building codes...
@hadassahward So in wealthy areas like San Francisco there can be no housing crisis? Seems legit
@hadassahward @cpk289 @AOC This alone is not evidence of any crisis. Things change.

@ajessilee @candlehurricane @SylviaHernandez @cpk289 @AOC The greater Atlanta metro area has single rooms for rent in some areas under $300/mo. 2bed/2.5 bath townhomes for $900-1000. All in ample supply. There is no housing crisis in the Atlanta metro area.
@ajessilee @candlehurricane @SylviaHernandez @cpk289 @AOC Atlanta does not face a housing crisis or high rents anything like Seattle or San Francisco. We do not have anything remotely near the same levels of homeless as is seen in those areas.
@candlehurricane @MarkORWalsh @TravisPrebble @cpk289 @AOC Condescension is an effective strategy

@onlykindofbrave @TravisPrebble @cpk289 @AOC It's almost as if I work nights and sleep during the day
@MarkORWalsh @candlehurricane @TravisPrebble @cpk289 @AOC $1200 average rent and ample supply are not a housing crisis.
@glenn_schwoyer @AOC 2008 was brought about by aggressive federal homeownership policies to encourage lending on new homes. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac set most of the underwriting guidelines that led to a wave of mortgage defaults. But okay
@BertSaysWoof @AOC You realize you're obscuring the point here, right? I'm not talking about safety codes.
@SylviaHernandez @cpk289 @AOC Tell that to San Francisco
@PostoBelloApiar @cpk289 @AOC Atlanta has no housing crisis and there is a shitload of wealth here. We have plenty of people making middle class salaries living in cars because nobody will build new affordable housing. And we're not the only place.
@cpk289 @AOC That's interesting because there are plenty of very wealthy areas without overbearing zoning regulations that don't have a housing crisis, yet just about everywhere with a high regulatory burden experiences stifled development vis a vis affordable housing.
@AOC People are sleeping in cars because of housing regulations that drive up costs and make homes unaffordable. But sure let's blame the rich guy paying the paycheck already

@MaryKayCabot @clevelanddotcom give the guy some better rookies and watch him work. Right guy for the job. The GM has too much power.
@MaryKayCabot @clevelanddotcom The bigger question is why he keeps putting these videos out... trying to get traded?
@MaryKayCabot @clevelanddotcom The Browns are not his AA sponsor. As long as he's honoring whatever understanding he has with Pett, so what.
@MaryKayCabot I don't know why they would repeat that.
@TMC_PREZ @MaryKayCabot your response came to a tweet about starting field position.
@TMC_PREZ @MaryKayCabot what the heck does starting field position have to do with keeping a coach?
@MaryKayCabot @evanmac3 it's so easy to get a script for that stuff, it's insane to not have one. Then again, just don't take it.
@MaryKayCabot @clevelanddotcom no reason anyone should have anything negative to say about this.
@Farts_Clinton @MaryKayCabot @Browns  got DL Desmond Bryant on March 2013 when he signed as a FA.
@MaryKayCabot Haslam ought to keep his word. Fill his own role with an experienced football exec and leave the rest in place.
@ProFootballTalk "...with Marshall Faulk, Michael Irvin, Kurt Warner, and Steve Mariucci both calling out Manning..." both or all? 4 names.
@MaryKayCabot keep coach Pettine! As for Farmer, I could take him or leave him.
@MaryKayCabot I kind of want to see AD kick. Could be fun.
@ProFootballTalk @MaryKayCabot I don't think ProFootballTalk is elite. FIGHT!
@MaryKayCabot might as well get fired up. I'm liking Pettine's comments more and more.
@ProFootballTalk @MaryKayCabot I'm pretty sure the winning coach can say just about whatever he wants. A W is a W.
@treed1919 I do think two heads are better than one where Farmer is concerned. Still scratching my head over the Bowe deal.
@treed1919 @MaryKayCabot Tom, If I recall we both agree Pettine needs 1 more year to right the ship. What are your thoughts on Farmer?
@daturneresq @RalphCindrich @MaryKayCabot I get the impression he's trying to rally the troops for a much tougher game.
@AaronWilson_NFL Jadaveon is a game wrecker?
@treed1919 amen to that, Tom
@treed1919 @MaryKayCabot I think Pettine has handled a complete clusterf*** about as well as anybody.
@ericbranch17 what's up Eric!
@MaryKayCabot THANK THE LORD

@zakbishop @MaryKayCabot solid IN the building
@MaryKayCabot I just can't say that Pettine is the problem. I really believe he is part of the solution.
@MazDiesel @KenSarnoff @MaryKayCabot @GabeIkard @Browns no sweat man, I was just issuing a correction.
@wogsland @Cece602 Brad, this does not concern you. I'll thank you to stay out of our business &amp; our lives lest you do more damage.
@wogsland @Cece602 and seriously what on earth has any of this to do with you?
@wogsland @Cece602 dude we've been long since out of there. Call me or shut your trap.
@wogsland @Cece602 you have no idea what you're talking about. Take this somewhere else.
@wogsland @Cece602 if we had any idea obviously that would not have happened. This isn't the appropriate forum.
@MazDiesel @KenSarnoff @MaryKayCabot @GabeIkard @Browns waivers don't work that way. Player goes to the team that claims him.
@MaryKayCabot I'm really starting to think Bowe is perhaps the biggest free agent bust by the Browns in quite some time.
@MetsFans_United Lions are not my team. It just wasn't PI dude.
@CChaffee201 @Bill84287 @MaryKayCabot Josh McCown leads the NFL in 3rd down completion % for one thing. QB play is not the @Browns problem.
@MetsFans_United both players going for the ball isn't PI.
@BlexClex that was one heck of a lucky call on the facemask. Good throw and catch!
@MaryKayCabot @Browns didn't become this terrible in two seasons. It will take more time to fix it.
@MaryKayCabot I would like to see the @Browns  recognize this dysfunction takes more than 2 seasons to fix &amp; stick with this HC for a while.
@MaryKayCabot I liked it when they locked him up in contract. Davis is a very capable QB.
@pye travel safe, amigo
@MaryKayCabot I sure hope so
@CChaffee201 @Bill84287 @MaryKayCabot Cory, speak for yourself, please.
@mcrichierich @Joe_Koss @MaryKayCabot there's more than one reason. This is a ridiculous dichotomy.
@Joe_Koss @MaryKayCabot Josh McCown is a tough dude. Have you seen the beatings he's played through this season? Don't be silly.
@rio_vaughn @SnakeLaFleur @TonyGrossi can't challenge in last 2 min. Coach would look like an idiot. Team submits that to NFL for review.

@milo3327 @MaryKayCabot how in the hell was that Pettine's fault?
@MaryKayCabot yay, Browns win draft position. Silver linings. ARGH
@MaryKayCabot he's needed his head checked for some time. Just saying.
@MaryKayCabot very good writeup
@MaryKayCabot Tabs has the ST unit working fine. Lol
@Stimpy363 welcome to twitter, the armpit of the Internet
@MaryKayCabot I absolutely think this is the right call by Pettine. Lying after you promised you wouldn't make headlines is no bueno.
@MaryKayCabot he is a class act
@MaryKayCabot there's nothing illegal or inherently wrong with going out.
@MaryKayCabot when someone gives an explanation that, while plausible, is untrue, that's no good for recovery. Ie "videos/pics can be old"
@ard1986 @MaryKayCabot so people problems don't deserve a shot?
@MaryKayCabot i think he did pretty well. I also think they're doing the right thing in handing him nothing he doesn't earn.
@JohnVicic you're nuts bro
@Brodey200 I can see him being accountable for it, but not fired. He's addressed the offense despite glaring needs, as advertised.
@Brodey200 the defense doesn't seem to be utilizing personnel as well this year, and I agree it's been atrocious for all the money spent.
RT @RapSheet: With Dion Lewis out for the season, the #Patriots recently worked out Pierre Thomas and Robert Turbin at that position.
@Brodey200 Cincy stuck with Marvin Lewis and they have finally gotten it going. consistency is worth a try, in my opinion
@Brodey200 I cannot disagree w/ you there. I'd like to see Pettine get more time to turn it around. CLE didn't fall apart in a day, u know?
@Brodey200 I 100% support gameday roster decisions based on how CLE can best compete now, playoff-bound or not. I like Pettine's approach.
@Brodey200 absolutely, but I'm fine with them evaluating based on the body of work including position meetings, practice, preseason, etc.
@Brodey200 she doesn't care for Manziel, sure. I don't think Pettine does, either, at this point anyway.
@ronEgee @treed1919 @MaryKayCabot yeah, now that Lewis is healthy and in a spread system, he's pretty darn good. Time passes.
@MaryKayCabot NOBODY KNOWS WHY MANZIEL WAS IN TREATMENT. For crying out loud...
@Brodey200 @MaryKayCabot so reporters can't have opinions? Everyone else does.
@EvensonCA @MaryKayCabot LOL, funny choice of words. I'm pretty sure part of Manziel's problems had to do with getting plastered. j/s
@MaryKayCabot just beat the steelers. Whoever goes out better get that job done. Will somebody step on Ben's foot?
@MaryKayCabot Good for him. Control what he can control, it's not his business what everyone else thinks.

@MaryKayCabot great googly moogly
@JimWalker13 @Omarltl @MaryKayCabot I get your point, but the NFL is the NFL. They have broad power &amp; routinely use it.
@blynch440 @MaryKayCabot look at the O-line. Josh is taking a lot more abuse than any Browns QB in recent memory due to crappy protection.
@treed1919 @MaryKayCabot the O line cost us  against Denver. They are a much better unit than they are playing in 2015.
@ohiodisneydad @MaryKayCabot agreed
@MaryKayCabot why does everybody hate on Mary Kay? It's not her fault the Browns are sucking wind.
@MaryKayCabot Manziel may as well still be a rookie. His first year was a wash. Glad they are committed to McCown.
@Gunslinger12b @MaryKayCabot amen to that. How ARE they not for profit. What a joke!
@Orange_n_Brown @MaryKayCabot the powers that be need to learn some patience.
@MaryKayCabot @CLEvideos what dirt does Bowe have over someone in the Browns organization to still be on the roster? Prove me wrong, Dwayne!
@JoshMcCown12 go get it today, Josh!
@blynch440 @MaryKayCabot it's hard to get any yards when the line let a guy in the backfield so quickly. SACKED.
@MattPotyonek @MaryKayCabot great rejoinder
@MaryKayCabot @MaryKayCabot i like Desir, hope he continues to develop
@MaryKayCabot that series was horrible.
@MaryKayCabot @MaryKayCabot  the DEN offense had 23 scoreless Off posessions until they finally got a TD against CLE. Flip is right on this.
@ChrisChavez01 @MaryKayCabot be has 5 TDs. He's been a bright spot for this offense. Ie, star.
@JimWalker13 @Omarltl @MaryKayCabot she is reporting an eyewitness account documented by the police.
@MaryKayCabot can't disagree with you here. Decision making is a big part of addiction/recovery and that is a red flag at best.
@MaryKayCabot the Browns played a full 60 minutes +OT against an undefeated team w/ a formidable defense. They lost, oh well. Team improving
@MaryKayCabot interesting perspective. The eyewitness accounts paint a different picture. Addiction is no joke &amp; requires a lifestyle change
@MaryKayCabot i didn't write him off!
@MaryKayCabot what a game!
Go @Browns !!!!!
@joejake16 so about that backup comment... McCown looked pretty solid today. EAD
@D_TheCannibal @MaryKayCabot can you challenge offsides? Never seen that challenged but then again never really thought about it.

@MaryKayCabot TMZ and/or some of the players lying. MKC, check out TED talk on spotting deception; then ask the offensive players :)
@MaryKayCabot thirty mile zone
@joejake16 okay Joe. You're right. Except for the stats &amp; the film which suggest the exact opposite, you're spot on dude.
@joejake16 39 total rushing yards did not get us back into that game. Thank McCown for the comeback or don't; he brought us back regardless.
@joejake16 @MaryKayCabot last I checked, good teams don't let garbage teams back into games.
@joejake16 you've got to be joking about PowerPoint. This team NEEDS continuity, not more upheaval. Get off it already.
@joejake16 and yet despite a lackluster run game, McCown had us knocking at the door late in the game. We were one dimensional not due to 13
@joejake16 remember last season? It started pretty well until Farmer and (arguably ownership) overrode Pettine. Watch the film.
@joejake16 @MaryKayCabot The QB play was not the issue last week. Look at the rushing yards and tell me that McCown was the problem.
@MaryKayCabot @FieldYates Davis has proven he can win games with the Rams. Glad we got him locked in!
@joejake16 @MaryKayCabot false dichotomy. Plenty of direct ways to address, like "coach, can u help me understand why JM isn't starting?"
@FifeAndy @MaryKayCabot look at pressers by Bill Belichik of the Pats and tell me if you still feel the same way. Less is more.
@MaryKayCabot i love this move. Davis is a capable player.
@joejake16 @MaryKayCabot Pettine is good forthe Browns. The problems lie elsewhere. #management
@MaryKayCabot @TMZ_Sports could be Haslam, or Farmer. Could have been anybody. Who cares. Stand behind you words, don't hide behind TMZ.
@MaryKayCabot Rabbit definitely benefited from JM playing, but would the @Browns most improved player really go there? Smacks of hearsay.
@MaryKayCabot Can't see Hawk, Hartline, Gabriel, Barnidge, or the O-Line saying it. Competitors should express their opinions in house.

@MaryKayCabot biggest difference in Manziel is that he is less focused on his image and more on his life &amp; craft. So that's reason to hope.
@MaryKayCabot the Browns did not become bad in one day. Johnny didn't become in need of rehab in one day. Easy does it. Have a little faith.
@MaryKayCabot Browns didn't start tanking in one day. Easy does it.
@MaryKayCabot I'll be pissed if they ditch Pettine. Honestly the draft and FA was so much better this year, Farmer is OK with me.

@coachjodom @MaryKayCabot @coachjodom @MaryKayCabot the 1st draft (1st round especially) was disappointing in 14, much better this year.
@coachjodom @MaryKayCabot OL depth is a serious concern although they addressed OL and DL with good picks. gotta start somewhere.
@coachjodom @MaryKayCabot agree with you about the WRs... we need big, capable targets but they needn't be a true #1 in WC system
@coachjodom @MaryKayCabot Pettine is building the @Browns into something good.

@coachjodom @MaryKayCabot a rough start is only that. JM is improving. Duke is healing, &amp; we won games w/ Crow &amp; West in '14.
@yaggazoozy @MaryKayCabot I'm really drawing a blank.

@MaryKayCabot If you put on his game tape from his time in Chicago, @JoshMcCown12  proves proven no situation is too big for him.
@MaryKayCabot @JoshMcCown12 got a bad deal in Tampa in 2014. TB's offense was set up to fail after their new OC took a leave of absence.
@MaryKayCabot He's completed passes under pressure, showed mobility &amp; more accuracy on the run the he has shown in the past.
@MaryKayCabot It's game 3: did anybody really think they wouldn't have @JoshMcCown12 play more snaps &amp; elevate his game tonight.
@MaryKayCabot 1/? - so many ppl are whining about @JoshMcCown12 in this thread... SHUT IT! McCown play is solid. He's a leader &amp; a coach.
@MaryKayCabot Devlin was working w/ QB coach O'Connell. Familiarity with his abilities, limitations is huge for a position coach esp new one
@MaryKayCabot @JoeBanner13 Banner somehow reclaimed a 1st rounder for Richardson. The guy deserves an award for that voodoo alone.
@MaryKayCabot Lombardi pushed for Manziel. The club was top heavy; I'm very happy with Pettine, and Farmer to a lesser extent. Good staff.
@MaryKayCabot Banner did a lot to move the Browns in a good direction. I think it's crazytoo fire ANY coach (Chud) after 1 year.
@MaryKayCabot never is it a bad idea to get multiple medical opinions when one has the means
@MaryKayCabot Pettine said if this were regular season and they needed him he could go but risk aggravating further. Why risk in preseason?
@MaryKayCabot he's got the height, size, and speed. Needs to progress &amp; get healthy is all. Too early to write off Pryor

@MaryKayCabot This is the NFL getting "tough on discipline" after Goodell thought a two game suspension was initially enough for Ray Rice.
@dooger60 @MaryKayCabot For OT games played in current format, can you source documentation correlating coin toss/game winner? Very curious.
@MaryKayCabot "especially when the NFL had a public relations nightmare after insulting domestic abuse victims everywhere." Such malarkey.
@Amploxx @MaryKayCabot @BrownsChalkTalk NFL forbids GM/Owner from call/texting in coach booth; trainers/medics are exempt for player safety.
@treed1919 @MaryKayCabot I have no problem with what people do in their own spare time but I'd have my doubts about this guy.
@MaryKayCabot @nflcommish NFL is too reactionary. Star RB Rice cut 2 games but #Browns may lose pick bc of harmless texting? C'mon Roger!
@MaryKayCabot The @nfl wants credibility after the fact. If #NFL hadn't bungled Rice's discipline, texting &amp; air pressure wouldn't be news!
Well said @treed1919 	http://t.co/yH1ZI6S5dX
@MaryKayCabot Fine the owner &amp; move on @nfl. 	Show where #Browns got a competitive advantage in any 2014 game or shush @nflcommish
@MaryKayCabot so nobody saw mccown with the bears? He surprised me.
@MaryKayCabot Manziel isn't horrible. He's a non-prototypical phenom and a project from day 1. Too soon to judge.
@MaryKayCabot teams can request to not be the feature team but the league can force the issue unless I'm mistaken.
@MaryKayCabot of course this is speculation, but text-gate has Haslam's prints all over it.
@MaryKayCabot Shaw has his limitations but he's a gutsy player who works hard. Can fit well in a west coast system.
@MrOzzzzzzzy @MaryKayCabot Pettine benched a 1st rd CB &amp; cut marquee FA RB Ben Tate when he fussed over carries. Give the guy SOME credit!
@jbur8 @MaryKayCabot KC wasn't paying top $ to keep a WR in a draft loaded w/ WRs.	Bowe is a big/fast/strong WR. DB/LB matchup nightmare.
@jbur8 @MaryKayCabot no WR caught a TD pass- they have receiving TEs &amp; RBs. The Chiefs have Chris Kelce (sp?), a promising young TE.
@MaryKayCabot character?
@MaryKayCabot saw this coming
@MaryKayCabot GET HIM
@AdamSchefter @MaryKayCabot I love Sheard's athleticism/versatility. Shame he left; great fit w/ Pats though. Good luck @jabaalsheard !
@AbramsonPBP @MaryKayCabot that's a real shame if he/agent/others leaked info of a "deal" w Browns to drive up Dolphins offer.
RT @viccarucci: Hearing the #Browns are not a threat to land Clay.
@C42Clay good luck in free agency! We want your services in Cleveland!
@ArmandoSalguero @MaryKayCabot eh. Too bad we couldn't keep him. Moving on.
@MaryKayCabot i do not think Bowe is a good addition. Maybe a band aid.
@MaryKayCabot @CharlesRobinson  aw crap.
@MaryKayCabot @Rand_Getlin I'm glad we kept him. Add in Charles Clay and we can really open up the offense.
@MaryKayCabot Browns were smart in one respect to let Hoyer walk: no QB controversy &amp; healthy QB group (at least physically).
@MaryKayCabot McCown is a guy I would want in my QB room if I'm still assessing my 1st round QB. Proven reliever in WC system.
@MaryKayCabot silly to think the Browns couldn't get a 2 year deal like this w/ Hoyer. No question: he is worth $10.5m / 2 yrs.
@Jawhosaphax @MaryKayCabot Hoyer's is fewer years - and still very much a bridge QB contract - I think Mccown is 12 mil over 3 years.
@MaryKayCabot I guess my point is that Pettine should do his job, not the GM or owner. He's got credibility.
@MaryKayCabot people snickered at the mention of Hoyer's name last preseason and he silenced them until we lost Mack and had no solution.
@MaryKayCabot Browns are methodically rebuilding. Last year nobody talked about #16 Hawkins and he showed up big during the season.
@MaryKayCabot everyone is so negative! Browns led the division @ midseason! If you want to see a team get too good too fast, look @ Falcons
@MaryKayCabot welcome home
@MaryKayCabot Good for Browns. Solid wide receiver, capable in the run game. Does anybody remember Hartline as Buckeye? Smart player.
@MaryKayCabot I get the gut feeling. Welcome home Brian!
@DustinFox37 @MaryKayCabot underrated and very capable. Good, smart receiver.
@MaryKayCabot he's got potential especially in a zone scheme and he's versatile although I DO NOT LIKE HIM PLAYING CENTER. lol
@MaryKayCabot that makes more sense for the last two. I don'tthink anybody would try to sign Kitchen or Bademosi for 2nd rd.
@StankFreakNasty @deg4 I hope the Browns will match any reasonable offer for Gipson. Still, a 2nd rounder is good compensation.
@MaryKayCabot I am pretty sure we can retain both Kitchen, Bademosi with those tenders.
@MaryKayCabot I love Robertson in coverage &amp; ST. Gipson was lights out until his injury... really hope both stay healthy. Versatile guys.
@MaryKayCabot if I were coach/GM, I would be working the RFA process everytime I could.  Great way to assess market value &amp; not overpay.
@LetItRide81 @JStern_3 @NathanZegura @Browns Charles Clay TE/FB great fit
@MaryKayCabot all the best Josh McCown. He's can alter perceptions in camp. He's looked capable when I've watched him w CHI &amp; TB.
@MaryKayCabot i still do not understand going away from Hoyer unless last year's Manziel situation &amp; texting nonsense ruffled him.
@MaryKayCabot McCown flashed big potential early. @Browns pls #PayHoyer for past W-L &amp; stability at QB NOW, take QB lower on draft board.
@MaryKayCabot Really, Kiper? Lol
@cincylaw @MaryKayCabot I also left out Manziel lol. Can't evaluate on 6 qtrs.		he helped Newton transition to NFL. That's a solid reference
@SNFMikeRyan @mortreport is Electromyography the test where they send impulses through your nerves to help locate the source of weakness?
@MaryKayCabot @cincylaw worked w/ Cam Newton pre-draft/combine; Mcnabb sought Whit's help while he was an NFL QB  http://t.co/5KLfNzvYm7.
@MaryKayCabot said Manziel "I want to be the first rookie to win a Super Bowl" last year pre-draft. Meaningless, just saying.

@MaryKayCabot #SIGNHOYER
@MaryKayCabot It's clear that Haslam has been far too involved from the jump. He pushed for Manziel, why wouldn't he meddle in playcalling?

@MaryKayCabot this is all a bunch of reactionary BS because they (NFL &amp; Goodell) botched Ray Rice situation so spectacularly.
@MaryKayCabot no way Browns should lose a draft pick over a text msg. League discipline is a joke. Overly harsh penalties just confirm it.
@MaryKayCabot Gordon cannot even enter the Browns' facility. Let him get it right or use him as trade bait. He's barely a Brown right now.
@MaryKayCabot exactly the right call by the Browns. Nothing to lose, everything to gain.
@MaryKayCabot I applaud him for taking positive steps to straighten out his life.
@MaryKayCabot NO. He won't count against the roster while suspended and it pushes back his contact. Trade or keep. Crazy to cut him.
@Cece602 delicious food with my delicious wife
@kwmo17 good luck this year!
@OotsRf 100% agree with you. JG's talent is going to waste when he is idle due to suspensions.
@OotsRf 2/2 for all of 2015, his contract is on hold &amp; Browns have 2 more years. Browns can put him on commish's exempt list, keep leverage.
@OotsRf Browns have no reason to cut him. A team will deal a player/pick for JG during draft/FA or season. Plus, if JG is out (continued)
@OotsRf @MaryKayCabot this is about a 23 year old kid being foolish &amp; making mistakes. Doesn't need to be cut. He isn't Ray Rice. Get a grip
@MaryKayCabot and for any other man, on the grounds they are the same race, to sit in judgment of JG is ridiculous if he doesn't know him.
@MaryKayCabot Smith can shove it. I see his point, but how does no one see the complete hypocrisy of the NFL here?
@MaryKayCabot Gordon has essentially been targeted by the NFL to the detriment of the Browns. He's 23yrs old. Such BS from NFL.
@MaryKayCabot how a diluted test automatically counts as positive to the NFL is also insane. God forbid someone wants to hydrate.
@MaryKayCabot NFL and Colts personnel went to great lengths to actively conceal Irsay's drug problem. Gordon has been cooperative.
@MaryKayCabot completely insane to consider taking doctor prescribed cough syrup as substance abuse... just for starters.
@MaryKayCabot i wonder how many substance abuse &amp; mental health experts the NFL consulted when crafting sub. abuse policy.
@MaryKayCabot and again, this all stemmed from MJ use. NFL should eliminate penalties considering it's legal in many states &amp; not a PED.
@MaryKayCabot the guy keeps making mistakes &amp; keeps owning them. Needs to figure out why he keeps making poor decisions. I hope he does!
@MaryKayCabot yes, the Browns are counting on him. He's a fallible human deserving same care as anyone. Also, NFL should get over pot use.
@Cece602 was Avery excited?
@MaryKayCabot he's under contract. this was alcohol. Require that he be evaluated and put on commish exempt list. Draft replacements. Solved
@caplannfl @MaryKayCabot This seems like a good thing. Experienced playcaller to help rookie OC. Derek Carr had good year in OAK; go Flip!

@MaryKayCabot not bad- a guy with ties to both QBs. What's his previous coaching experience? I recall when NE drafted O'Connell. Gone fast.
@corryjoel @MaryKayCabot speaking of 1st rounders... wish CLE would have traded #2 away when he was seen as a messiah after 1 qtr in BUF.
@corryjoel @MaryKayCabot I am still amazed that CLE actually GOT a 1st round pick back for him, and from Indy of all teams.

@AdamSchefter @MaryKayCabot Browns should draft a WR or 10.

@MaryKayCabot no NFL tape on Shaw = wildcard

@JWArnett16 Russ Wilson 50% bigger than Manziel? Probably bc Russ &gt; years&amp;starts in NCAA &amp; &gt; time in NFL, FAR &gt; NFL strength&amp;conditioning

@makaio9 let me c if I comprehend: u cuss out @MaryKayCabot 4 getting a player 2 tell truth but you're glad he's gone? Think about that.
@makaio9 right, I'm showing my intelligence. I articulated w/o the need to offfset my lack of vocabulary w/ profanity @MaryKayCabot
@makaio9 and your're right,  @MaryKayCabot can take it. It's me w/ the beef. TATE'S PLAY MADE HIM EXPENDABLE. What don't you get?
@makaio9 @MaryKayCabot how are daughters different? Do you know how old my daughter is? Tough behind a keyboard, pat urself on back big guy.
@makaio9 sorry u think @MaryKayCabot spoiled ur man crush. His average play &amp; young RBs big play made 44 expendble. We need Dline &amp; LB.
@makaio9 @MaryKayCabot you talk down to ppl a lot? Call women bi+ches? I have a daughter; anybody talks 2 her that way I'll be @ their door.
@makaio9 @MaryKayCabot not faulting Tate. he is now paid in MIN. Pettine guys are team first &amp; mentally tough. Wake up, best season in yrs!
@makaio9 listen up: criticism not same as abuse. U should be ashamed talking to anyone like that. U have a sister/mom? @MaryKayCabot
@makaio9 would you keep a guy who didn't want to work 4 u bc he was unhappy w/ his job? Clearly impacted his performance. @MaryKayCabot
@makaio9 Hey tough guy, watch how u talk 2 ppl. Everybody has a job to do &amp; @MaryKayCabot has done hers well for yrs.Tate made his own bed.
