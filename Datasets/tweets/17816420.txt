@USTradeRep @fitbit @JLabAudio @cedarelectron to @usda: The the countries with the highest volume of dash cameras are China and Russia. To provide high quality products for truckers, we need to be in ecosystems that support our products and allow us to scale.
@USTradeRep @fitbit @ustraderep asks @jlabaudio if the company can move to Taiwan and Mexico, where its competitors are. Response: No
@USTradeRep @fitbit @fitbit's goal is to make Americans healthier. 75% of its employees are in the U.S. explains General Counsel Andy Missan
@USTradeRep @fitbit Tariffs would cause @Fitbit's competitors to gain market share of wearables, putting American's sensitive health data in the hands of the Chinese
@USTradeRep @fitbit A third of @fitbit's wearables shipments will happen in the Q4. Imposing tariffs will harm consumers, retailers and workers says General Counsel Andy Missan #notradetax
@JLabAudio @USTradeRep @wincramer @cedarelectron "25% tariffs on wearables will hurt American workers, stifle innovation and won't advance the administration's agenda" says @fitbit General Counsel Andy Missan

@JLabAudio The job creators testifying before @USTradeRep are “building the foundation for the next generation of entrepreneurs that will keep America Great” says @jlabaudio CEO @WinCramer #NoTradeTax
@JLabAudio is an award winning designers of personal audio products and employs about 40 people in its Texas and California offices.
State Dept has a follow up for @Brilliant, could they move their production elsewhere? Their response: We would look at countries outside of the U.S. India is an option, not ideal. Lots of supply chain issues, which brings lots of unnecessary risks for our young company.
State Dept asks @Brilliant if IP theft is of concern for them. Their response: No, because we don't provide software source to China, only product sourcing.
Follow up from @SBAgov: any products in particular hurt small businesses on the tariffs list? Our response: infrastructure items would hurt small businesses. https://t.co/bZEXfTeWOX
SBA rep asks @CTAtech which products are difficult to source outside of China? Our response: A great number of products, especially small businesses. Anything in the #IoT ecoystem will be harmed. And the real losers are American consumers who will have to pay more.
The proposed tariffs "disproportionately affect startup companies and may affect the viability of some of these companies which would otherwise grow to be major contributors to the economy" says @brillianttech CEO
@BrilliantTech As a startup with modest resources the costs and timelines are not practical for @Brillianttech. "it would cost approximately a million dollars, and take many months, to relocate manufacturing outside China" - CEO Aaron Emigh
"The sudden introduction of a 25% tariff would render our business impractical" and @brillianttech will be forced to raise our prices says CEO Aaron Emigh #NoTradeTax
@USTradeRep Startup @brillianttech employs 30 people around the country and its smarthome control device is created entirely in the U.S. The announcement of the tariffs come just as they are bringing their product to market
@USTradeRep Small companies will be hit the hardest after new wave of tariffs are imposed – many being startups that design and engineer U.S. intellectual property.
