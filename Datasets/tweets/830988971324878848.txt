@WildBillWellman @tjrjr12 @ADuralde At one prohibiting car manufacturers from directly selling cars to consumers also made sense. Nowadays though, Tesla makes a compelling example for why consumers should be able to buy directly from manufacturer.
@WildBillWellman @tjrjr12 @ADuralde As an outsider looking in, that seems false because Amazon and Netflix produce content that studios regularly pass on. Hard to imagine a traditional studio producing Transparent or Bojack Horseman.	Maybe it‚Äôs time to go back and revisit those rules and decisions.
@WildBillWellman @tjrjr12 @ADuralde Maybe it will, maybe it won‚Äôt; only time will tell. If it does become one, we have the tools to tell and the laws to trust bust. Considering many studios are now launching their own streaming services, this suggests they‚Äôre adapting and competing.

@WildBillWellman @tjrjr12 @ADuralde And you‚Äôre right, there are many things about artistic fields I don‚Äôt know. But I do know a monopoly when I see one and Netflix? That ain‚Äôt it.
@WildBillWellman @tjrjr12 @ADuralde I agree that monopolies are bad. I would not and have not argued otherwise. 		I disagree that Netlfix is a monopoly. Both consumers and film producers have many choices in the marketplace.
@WildBillWellman @tjrjr12 @ADuralde I‚Äôll be the 1st to admit I‚Äôm not an expert on film production. I do know a thing or two though about supply, demand, and profit maximization. I also know as a consumer, I don‚Äôt care about the middlemen between me and the people making the stuff I enjoy.
@WildBillWellman @tjrjr12 @ADuralde Studios should get out of the sell to exhibitor business and start selling directly to consumers like Netlfix. It‚Äôs not Netflix‚Äôs fault that they found a way to cut out the middleman.
@WildBillWellman @tjrjr12 @ADuralde If a studio had its own exclusive theaters or streaming service that offered the same movies at a lower price, I‚Äôd give them my money in a heartbeat. All I care about is the movie. The distributor is nothing but a middleman. To me, the viewer, they add zero value.
@WildBillWellman @tjrjr12 @ADuralde What‚Äôs wrong with that? Cut out the middleman. Is the insurance industry - a middle man between healthcare consumers and healthcare providers - woke? Is the car dealership model woke? I‚Äôd rather buy a Tesla direct form Tesla than a Ford through middleman who take their cut.
@WildBillWellman @matthewstoller @ADuralde So yes, I acknowledge the negative consequences. Do you acknowledge the positive ones?
@WildBillWellman @matthewstoller @ADuralde Economic innovation creates winners and losers. Automobiles put a lot of horse buggy manufactures out of business. Someday I might be on the losing end of such change. That‚Äôs life in the marketplace.
@WildBillWellman @tjrjr12 @ADuralde They found a more efficient model. Good for them. Studios should take a page out of their books. Maybe instead of Netflix becoming more like studios, studios should be more like Netflix?
@WildBillWellman @tjrjr12 @ADuralde I like how you didn‚Äôt even address the fact how old Hollywood in 2019 still fails to give equal opportunities to marginalized groups. No wonder Netflix and Amazon are eating their lunch: diverse workforces are dominant workforces.
@WildBillWellman @matthewstoller @ADuralde Haha no. Considering I have a formal economics education and degree, ideologically I‚Äôm quite far away from them. Atlas Shrugged is trash.
@WildBillWellman @tjrjr12 @ADuralde No, more like Roma üòé		Also, let‚Äôs talk about how Netflix and Amazon have done amazing job creating job opportunity for women, POC, &amp; LGBT. Meanwhile, old Hollywood is still dominated by old white men.
@WildBillWellman @ADuralde If they limit choices then someone will come along that offers more choices. Exactly like what Netflix is doing to the studios right now. I‚Äôm not worried. Adapt or perish.
@WildBillWellman @matthewstoller @ADuralde You can actually determine whether or not a company is a monopoly based on economic models, math, and empirical evidence. I know you *feel* Netflix is a monopoly (are heading that way) but do you have *concrete evidence*?
@WildBillWellman @matthewstoller @ADuralde Economically, more often then not it is.
@Edu2ptsyseguido Esta en ingles pero ‚ÄúIn Bruges.‚Äù
@WildBillWellman @ADuralde Hollywood studios might make some good movies, but its model is to drive the maximum amount of viewers to theaters with 0 regard for the quality of the content they‚Äôre producing in the 1st place. Thus sequels &amp; remakes ad nauseam.
@WildBillWellman @tjrjr12 @ADuralde New crearive freedom like Point Break remake, Ghostbusters remake, Beauty &amp; Beast remake, The Mummy remake, Overboard remake, Robocop remake...		If only we could be so lucky for Netflix and Amazon to shake things up.
@WildBillWellman @matthewstoller @ADuralde Let‚Äôs be real: if Spielberg was a young director nowadays, he‚Äôd be making movies for Netflix and Prime. Old guard is scared of disruptive change. Churn baby churn.
@WildBillWellman @Capricciola If there quality is bad, then viewers will go elsewhere. There‚Äôs a large marketplace of content: Amazon, Hulu, YouTube, Twitch, Crunchyroll, Funimation, Vimeo, Roosterteeth and more traditional businesses: theaters, stores that sell DVDs, DVD rentals, etc.
@WildBillWellman @matthewstoller @ADuralde People out here arguing Netlfix is unfair because they don‚Äôt have to worry about being profitable. If Netflix doesn‚Äôt have to worry about being profitable, then the studios won‚Äôt need to worry about Netflix being a threat for long.
@RJWithOpinions @sacbee_news Did you have a stroke while writing that tweet? Try rewriting it because it doesn‚Äôt make sense.
@OakTree1980 @sacbee_news Exactly. In cases like this, outside state attorneys, feds, or outside special counsel needs to step in &amp; take over.
@RJWithOpinions @sacbee_news You can find this problem in red states and blue states. Problem is bigger than red vs blue. DAs are not incentivized to investigate the officers they work alongside 365 days a year. In cases like this, outside investigators need to step in.
@sacbee_news The incentives are all wrong for prosecutors to investigate the officers they work alongside 365 days a year. In cases like this, outsiders need to be brought in: state attorney‚Äôs, feds, or outside special prosecutors.

@matthewstoller I hear what you‚Äôre saying. I just disagree. If they‚Äôre not trying to produce good content, then how do they plan to kill their competition with bad content? Do you have any evidence that supports your theory? Like ticket sales?
@matthewstoller Counter argument: Netflix found a more efficient way to produce similar content at a lower cost. Instead of relying on ticket stubs, they instead rely on subscriptions.
@matthewstoller You‚Äôre acting as if Netflix and Amazon have zero incentive to produce good content.
@matthewstoller In order to protect the business model, new innovative models need to be banned from competing? I‚Äôm getting Luddite vibes from this comment.

@davidarlington1 @LindaFortWorth @scottkatie2000 @JohnCornyn The biggest difference between me and you is you find minorities of contrarian idealgues persuasive and I find majorities of experts armed with empirical data persuasive. Give me peer-review before you give me think tanks
@davidarlington1 @LindaFortWorth @scottkatie2000 @JohnCornyn He‚Äôs one voice among many. Like climate science, I‚Äôm inclined to side with a consensus of experts armed with empiricism rather than a minority of contrarian ideologues. David, you can cherry pick any self-proclaimed expert on any issue on the Internet.
@davidarlington1 @LindaFortWorth @scottkatie2000 @JohnCornyn Some would argue that the repeal of Glass-Seagal precipitated the Great Recession. As someone who sat through many lectures on the topic, I‚Äôd argue the causes were numerous and can‚Äôt be pinned on just one thing.
@davidarlington1 @LindaFortWorth @scottkatie2000 @JohnCornyn FDIC insurance is a form of govt intervention into the banking market. Are you arguing that has done more harm than good? Vaccine subsidizations are a government intervention into the healthcare market. Are you arguing that‚Äôs done more harm than good? The examples are endless.
@davidarlington1 @LindaFortWorth @scottkatie2000 @JohnCornyn David, respectfully, as someone who has formally studied econ, it‚Äôs hard for me to take your claim seriously. Saying ALL gov intervention does more harm than good is a weak argument. We have evidence that some interventions work better than others, and some don‚Äôt work at all.

@davidarlington1 @LindaFortWorth @scottkatie2000 @JohnCornyn However, I do love the idea of market based solutions, such as cap and trade. Currently, market doesn‚Äôt account for negative externalities created by carbon. Cap and trade would fix this market failure. Almost all economists (even conservative ones) support this plan.
@davidarlington1 @LindaFortWorth @scottkatie2000 @JohnCornyn If it was up to the market to decide, all the banks would have gone bust 10 years ago and we‚Äôd likely still be in the middle of a depression. Point: any economist worth their salt will tell you there are inefficiencies in markets that can be corrected through government action.
@davidarlington1 @LindaFortWorth @scottkatie2000 @JohnCornyn David, where are you getting that number from? Also, personally I see the GND as a starting point, not the end point. Let‚Äôs figure out together how to address climate cliff in the most efficient way.
@LindaFortWorth @davidarlington1 @scottkatie2000 @JohnCornyn ...hiring directly from these communities, make sure they‚Äôre getting priority attention, etc. We have the resources and the manpower to do this: the only thing in the way is lack of belief in ourselves.
@LindaFortWorth @davidarlington1 @scottkatie2000 @JohnCornyn If energy prices increase in the short run, then we need to make sure poor people can afford it. This is an easy problem to overcome and we have many existing fiscal and monetary policies to do it: increasing fed min wage, subsidizing energy to poor communities...
@LindaFortWorth @davidarlington1 @scottkatie2000 @JohnCornyn @LindaFortWorth @davidarlington1 which evidence based policies do you support to help negatively impacted poor communities while we transition to sustainable, carbon neutral energy sources?
@LindaFortWorth @davidarlington1 @scottkatie2000 @JohnCornyn I care about poor people Linda. The Green New Deal specifically addresses the needs of poor people who be affected by it. Keep in mind poor people around the globe are the ones affected MOST by climate change. If you care about poor pppl, then you should care about GND.
@LindaFortWorth @davidarlington1 @scottkatie2000 @JohnCornyn Reality: If we take action, there will be winners and losers. If we don‚Äôt take action, there will be winners and losers.

@Hesiod2k11 Economically, it makes no difference. To use an example, if the price of bread rises from $2 to $3, does it make a difference to you - the consumer - if it's because the tax was due to a sales tax or a tax on the production of eggs? Either way you're paying an extra $1 for eggs.
