Issues regarding the councils lack of transparency and possible gentrification of the area were the main points of contention. The people of this community will not allow their homes to be swindled out from underneath them by predatory developers.

Vets from all walks of life &amp; even from countries abroad join our Armed Forces to protect the American dream. Thanking you for your service seems too little a gesture for the many things you have lost: time, health, &amp; even life.
the Marine Corps' "SEMPER FIDELIS" (Always Faithful), 	the Army's "THIS WE'LL DEFEND," 	the Coast Guard's "SEMPER PARATUS" (Always Prepared), 	the Navy's "NON SIBI SED PATRIAE" (Not Self, but Country), and 	the Air Force's "AIM HIGH...FLY, FIGHT, WIN."
But since their inclusion these grps have played crucial roles in every major conflict; from the 2 WWs to the War on Terror. &amp; all vets embody the motto of each branch:
There have been times of seg &amp; lim to gender, sex orientation, and cit status. &amp; the presences of Latinx-Americans, Black-Americans, women, and LGQBT in our mil has evolved since the Rev War.
Veterans are those heroic individuals that have fought or kept the peace in conflicts all around the world. Overall, few heed the call and those who do should be honored for their bravery.
The El Voto team would like to thank every single veteran, both past &amp; present, for their selfless sacrifices for our freedoms. Although the following words are not enough for all that you have given on behalf of every individual living in our country we truly mean them. https://t.co/Kou0wmDWuo
