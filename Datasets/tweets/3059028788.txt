This pay increase for lawmakers and the Governor would make them the highest paid legislature and Governor in the country by 2021 @WTEN @News_8 @news4buffalo @NewsChannel9
RT @DanClarkReports: A heckler at the pay raise commission meeting! Never change New York
The Pay Commission approved unanimously the recommendation to give a pay raise to both lawmakers and the executive branch (Governor, LT. Governor, attorney general). The pay raise would be phased in for the next three years and would be tied to limiting outside income
The pay commission is also talking about limiting outside income for lawmakers. They are talking about this being a mandate, not a suggestion. The recommendation being discussed would limit outside income for lawmakers so they can not receive more then 15 percent of their salary
For background, legislators currently make a base pay of close to 80k, They have not received a pay raise for the past 20 years. They are the third highest paid legislature in the country.
Governor pay raise being discussed would also be phased in the next 3 years: 	2019: $200,000	2020: $225,000	2021: $250,000
HAPPENING NOW: Pay Commission meeting now down in NYC. So far they are talking about a pay raise for lawmakers phased in for the next 3 years:	2019: 110,00	2020: 120,00	2021: 130,00	@WTEN @News_8 @news4buffalo @NewsChannel34 @NewsChannel9 https://t.co/jbnmAsEyQe

@LarrySharpe: says water infrastructure needs to be fixed but the state shouldn‚Äôt pay for it. Companies should.
@MinerForNY: on clean water: says @NYGovCuomo has failed to build upstate infrastructure. Says she has always been fighting for clean water
@MinerForNY: says we need to redo the way we do educational aid. Need flexibility and accountability for schools
@HowieHawkins: need to have equal funding for schools across NY
@marcmolinaro: says we need to end common core. Must introduce trade classes back into high school
@LarrySharpe: ‚Äúthe entire system needs to be revamped from the bottom to the top‚Äù talking about education. Says we should get rid of the last two grades of high school because you don‚Äôt do anything in those classes
@HowieHawkins: says @NYGovCuomo appeals to the left but governs with the right. The excelsior scholarship doesn‚Äôt work.
@marcmolinaro: says tuition for N.Y. colleges needs to be lowered
@LarrySharpe: on excelsior scholarship. Says people don‚Äôt need college. Says free college is not the answer especially with New York schools
@MinerForNY: on the excelsior scholarship: says it didn‚Äôt work very well.
@MinerForNY: supports red flag gun laws. Need to bring everyone to the table to try and figure out new ways to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals. Need to tackle the cause of violence as well
@HowieHawkins: says social inequalities are the biggest reason for gun violence. But also should have good gun regulations
@marcmolinaro: says he also doesn‚Äôt support red flag gun laws but that the state should increase mental health services
@LarrySharpe: on red flag gun laws: says it forces other people to be ‚Äúsecret police.‚Äù

@MinerForNY: says she supports LGBTQ community and would make New York very inclusive
@marcmolinaro: says he would never let his daughter intern for the legislature because he thinks it is that corrupt when it comes to the #MeTooMovement
@LarrySharpe: says can‚Äôt just punish  people when it comes to the #metoo movement but you have to shine light and bring accountability
@MinerForNY: says Albany very affected by #metoo movement and nothing is being done. Says there needs to be hearings and expose the culture
@HowieHawkins: on the #metoo movement Hawkins says that there needs to be independent oversight of the legislature
@LarrySharpe: says all the other candidates are not giving real ideas. Says that there needs to be new ideas to fix infrastructure. Companies like Pepsi for example could own a road.
@MinerForNY: mentions the areas that are worried about their water. Says we need to work together to fix the problem.
@HowieHawkins: infrastructure should be a priority but should not be given a dedicated stream of money
@marcmolinaro: does not support a dedicated fund to fix water and sewer infrastructure. Says it needs to be fixed but only in a way that ensures the money is going directly to the problem
@marcmolinaro: says upstate deserves respect. Needs to be more affordable and lower property taxes. More job opportunities
@LarrySharpe: says we should not invest. That means more taxes. Says there needs to be ownership.
@MinerForNY: says we need to invest money in infrastructure in upstate. Severely lacking. Build broadband

@raabit1978 @CynthiaNixon This was during the New York Democratic Gubernatorial Debate. This was the host's first question
Just yelled at by a NYC photographer for being in the way and then physically shoved. Got to love being in the New York press pool
@CynthiaNixon : says she would turn her salary for Governor back to the state	@NYGovCuomo: says that Nixon should "pay her taxes" because she has a corporation
@CynthiaNixon does not support sports gambling	@NYGovCuomo says he does in the right way
@CynthiaNixon agrees homeless people should not be forcibly taken off the street. Says that this has to do with mental health but mostly with the housing crisis.
@NYGovCuomo on taking homeless people off the street to mental health centers against their will: "It's not going to work if the police have to force someone to a shelter." "We need a mental health system that works"
@NYGovCuomo says public sector unions should not be allowed to go on strike. Teachers won't be in school and MTA will collapse...so forth
@CynthiaNixon "Workers will only strike when they feel like they absolutely have to"
@CynthiaNixon says public sector workers should be able to strike without penalty
@CynthiaNixon says that Cuomo at first did not support 15 dollar minimum wage but now claims it as his idea. 	@NYGovCuomo turns to crowd and asks "how am I with labor" and crowd cheers
@NYGovCuomo defends bereavement bill in paid family leave act. Says "employees have rights."
@NYGovCuomo and @CynthiaNixon are arguing about tax returns.....Both have released their tax returns
A lot of time is being spent on MTA, Tappan Zee and other down state questions #NYGovDebate
@CynthiaNixon says she thinks Mario Cuomo was a great Governor, but the name for the Tappan Zee was done without input from the community and the cost of the bridge was hidden from people
CBS host calls out @NYGovCuomo for calling the bridge Tappan Zee. He then says "the Tappan Zee bridge is no more" then says the legislature was in charge of naming it @WTEN
@NYGovCuomo: says the toll on the Tappan Zee bridge will stay the same through 2020
@NYGovCuomo says he experimented with marijuana in college. Says he has counseled his children to make responsible choices @WTEN
@NYGovCuomo says he doesn't think racial justice starts with marijuana, but rather with housing and jobs. Says they are working on it in the Senate, but even though it didn't get passed they are working on it.
@CynthiaNixon says we need to legalize marijuana because it is a social justice issue. Says NY should follow other models and invest the money from legalizing marijuana back into low income areas.
@NYGovCuomo asks @CynthiaNixon if she is a corporation. Brings up Jessica Parker but doesn't quite explain why. Very confusing @WTEN
@CynthiaNixon and @NYGovCuomo keep snapping at each other. Very hostile @WTEN
CBS host tells the audience for the debate to be more quiet üòÇ@WTEN
@CynthiaNixon responds with pointing out Percoco and other corruption cases
@NYGovCuomo says he wants to take the money out of politics
@NYGovCuomo says that single payer health care system will double taxes and it's hard to do. Blames the President and says it needs to happen on the federal level. @CynthiaNixon says the state needs to show it can be done before the federal side will follow
@CynthiaNixon says New York can do single payer health care and it will be cheaper for individuals
@NYGovCuomo tells @CynthiaNixon  to stop interrupting and she tells him "if you stop lying" and he says "as soon as you do" @WTEN
RT @jessemckinley: Lotta crosstalk early on here in #NYGovDebate; @CynthiaNixon on attack, @NYGovCuomo calls her a "corporate Democrat."
@NYGovCuomo says that New York's infrastructure is crumbling everywhere, but then lists a ton of construction projects currently going on to try and fix this
@NYGovCuomo: "No one goes after Trump like I do"
@CynthiaNixon almost interrupted @NYGovCuomo but he stopped her
@CynthiaNixon tells Cuomo that if he really cares about progressive values why hasn't he done more like single payer health care system, solidifying Roe v Wade and more
@NYGovCuomo says unless he is struck down dead then he will serve for four years as Governor
@NYGovCuomo says he is not running for president he is running for Governor. "But someone has to stop him" and "he tweets at me every week" (speaking about @realDonaldTrump )
@NYGovCuomo says being Governor of New York is "real life" and that the Governor needs to know how to go after Trump
@NYGovCuomo starts off with acknowledging @SenJohnMcCain
@CynthiaNixon says she grew up and has been an advocate for schools and education for the past 17 years. Says she is not a as "experienced" as @NYGovCuomo, but it doesn't matter because Cuomo is an insider and has made a mess of the MTA and corruption trials of many close aids
