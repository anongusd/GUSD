@akhiest I haven't listened to this Sunday's with Tai Lopez but will soon!
@akhiest And I find that to be an intellectually uncurious thing to say. And I would pay similar criticism to Cenk. I'm no fan of him either and I think they both have similar styles. I also listen to Shapiro's daily podcast. I just don't think he's all that great as a conservative voice.
@akhiest I refer specifically to his style of "debate" where he will roll through someone on an issue without necessarily engaging with their perspective. He once argued over transgender issues and gender identity with the point of "you're not a chair of you say you're a chair."

You can't say Dems aren't serious about solving the issue when you are only willing to address the issues on a set of conditions. Yes, GOP has the majority, but don't act like you're not using family separation policy as a bargaining chip to pass the rest of your agenda.
Reason why Dems wouldn't vote for a bill that includes the banning of family separation is if GOP uses the issue to push an anti-immigrant agenda.

Don't let Paul Ryan fool you when he says he hates this policy as much as anyone else. His caucus, or at least the more conservative wing of the caucus during internal debate, is going to use it as best they can to promote an anti-immigrant, anti-Latinx agenda.
One of the worst parts about the zero-tolerance family separation by this administration is that it's likely to be a bargaining chip for republican legislators when trying to secure money for "the wall" during immigration legislation negotiations.
