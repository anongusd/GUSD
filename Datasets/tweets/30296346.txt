17m. Number one is 3 years of legislative relief for 700,000 DACA recipients brought here unlawfully by their parents at a young age many years ago.¬† This extension will give them access 2 work permits, Social Security numbers, and protection from deportation, most importantly.
17l. Furthermore, in order to build the trust and goodwill necessary to begin real immigration reform, there are two more elements to my plan.
17k. Many of these security ideas have been proposed by Democrats themselves, and all of them have been supported by Democrats in the past, including a physical barrier, wall, or fence.
17j. do not stop at our border; they permeate throughout our country and they end up in some places where you‚Äôd least expect them.¬† They go all over our country.¬† A steel barrier will help us stop illegal immigration while safely directing commerce to our lawful ports of entry.

17 h. We already have many miles of barrier, including 115 miles that we are currently building or under contract.¬† It will be done quickly. Our request will add another 230 miles this year in the areas our border agents most urgently need.¬† It will have an unbelievable impact.
17 g. Much of the border is already protected by natural barriers such as mountains and water.¬† We already have many miles of barrier, including 115 miles that we are currently building or under contract.¬† It will be done quickly.
17f. To physically secure our border, the plan includes $5.7 billion for a strategic deployment of physical barriers, or a wall.¬† This is not a 2,000-mile concrete structure from sea to sea.¬† These are steel barriers in high-priority locations.

15. In recent weeks, we have met with large numbers of Democrat lawmakers to hear their ideas and suggestions.¬† By incorporating the priorities of rank-and-file Democrats in our plan, we hope they will offer their enthusiastic support.¬† And I think many will.
14. The proposal I will outline today is based on, first and foremost, on input from our border agents and homeland security professionals ‚Äî and professionals they are.¬† They know what they‚Äôre doing.¬† It is a compassionate response to the ongoing tragedy on our southern border.

11a. 	The good news is, these problems can all be solved but only if we have the political courage to do what is just and what is right.
10b. Our immigration system should be the envy of the world, not a symbol of disunity and dysfunction.
10a. As a candidate for President, I promised I would fix this crisis, and I intend to keep that promise one way or the other.¬† Our immigration system should be the subject of pride, not a source of shame, as it is all over the world.
9b.¬† These are not talking points.¬† These are the heartbreaking realities that are hurting innocent, precious human beings every single day on both sides of the border.

7b. Heroin alone kills 300 Americans a week, 90 percent of which comes across our southern border.¬† We can stop heroin.
7a. Vast quantities of lethal narcotics are flooding through our border and into our communities, including meth, cocaine, heroin, and fentanyl.¬† Drugs kill 78,000 Americans a year and cost our society in excess of $700 billion.
6b. In fact, many loving mothers give their young daughters birth control pills for the long journey up to the United States because they know they may be raped or sexually accosted or assaulted.¬† Nearly 50 migrants a day are being referred for urgent medical care.
