Presumably, there is enough dirt in those emails to bring down prominent members of the RNC,  and as a result they have banded together in an effort to obstruct the investigation and hope they can sweep it under the rug completely.
The Republican National Committee was hacked by Russia around the time the DNC was hacked. The RNC emails were held by the Russians in order to gain leverage. https://t.co/E19KNLAod3

McCarthy and Ryan - in a closed door meeting - were taped saying that they knew Trump was paid by the Russians. If Trump goes down, he's going to take as many other people as possible and they all know it. This isn't about protecting Trump. It's about self-preservation.
It's because Trump isn't the only corrupt member of the GOP. We know that McConnell (and others) has taken Russian money through the NRA. They aren't stupid. They knew exactly where that money was coming from.
it's our lack of confidence Congress will fulfill its Constitutional obligations that drives our insecurity and questioning of DOJ policy. Today's headline in the Washington Post Most speaks precisely to that: We’re not going to turn on our own’: Republicans rally around Trump...

it would be too easy for Trump to feign outrage and fire him. That’s why Mueller’s next move will be his last, and it will be the big one, sweeping up everyone who is left at once.
This time, he must lay out a case that Trump and his campaign officials committed crimes that are so egregious, it will be impossible for the congress to fail to protect him from being fired. If Mueller were to indict Kushner alone, or Trump Jr. alone,
It’s going to be a jaw-dropping arrest and indictment because it has to be. Mueller can no longer issue indictments piecemeal and get guilty pleas or convictions one by one. https://t.co/e7tbhyI5SX
