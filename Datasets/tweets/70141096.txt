@CynBlogger @stanspak I think CNN toyed with that, but they could not keep up. Like Closed Captioning on a News Program that does a lot of improv. I believe they do it shortly after the foul Nationalist spews his imagination on Television.
@Uhuruhsiempre @EveScottGarner Yrump and his ilk, are like a cancer. When You think you have it in remission, it spreads somewhere else unexpected.

@ellievan65 Too bad for you all. You voted for the most dishonest man to ever disgrace the White House, so you have to live with the consequences, just as we do. Tough luck for you all, but you did it yourself, just like the Farmers, Coal Workers, Steel Workers, tough sh*t Trump Supporters.
@B52Malmet Yea, he looks like a REALLY, REALLY BAD, HORRIBLE ELVIS IMPERSONATOR. JUST A HUNKA, HUNKA BURNING CRAP.
@realDonaldTrump "Me thinks thou protest too much". Lies are the strongest defended. Truth needs no defence. You are a liar. There are no new steel mills opened. The Coal Industry is worse now than ever before. The farmers of America are living off of Tax Payers money. Yea, we're winning alright
@realDonaldTrump Why not just resign. I'm sure they we will give you and your family pardons IF you resign, and do it before the iminant impeachment proceedings. Or, do you only need 42 months?

@FoxNews @nikkihaley @realDonaldTrump Is the Republican Party now so TRUMPED, that they actually believe that what they say must be true, because they said It? Tally of lies have been compiled, and you have been found wanting.
@SpeakerRyan NOTHING you will ever say again will hold any credibility after Kavenaugh. You are gone from your Seat, next election. Sold your soul, sold America, and now you have no legitimate voice. You are a Trumpster From now on.

In other words, Republicans have the vote to confirm Kavenaugh, the Alcholic,  Accused Sex Offending, Anti-Womens Rights, Excommunicated, Forth most hated man in America. 		https://t.co/cliWVSsTri
@FoxNews @RepSwalwell And you Soul Sellers think Kavenaugh fits that discription?	You are nothing more than a Sinclair Corperation Mouth Piece. Shameless Non-Talented lackeys
From Sen. Jeff Merkley	Newspapers are reporting that some children detained by our government at the southern border were recently moved into the West Texas desert to live in hastily-built prison camps.		They were moved without advance notice and in the middle of the night..
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump "Appears". How much did you dishonorable, and I use this word VERY LOOSELY, Journalists sell your soul for? You have NO credibility.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Sorry, I had trouble reading your garbage. My bone spurs were acting up.
@realDonaldTrump No they are not. They could care less about Kavenaugh, just the money you pay them to fill the seats.
@KatrinaPierson @SenatorCollins Oh shut up. "Our Men"? What are you, Zena, Princess Warrior?	Your men are fighting to stay out of prison, is the ONLY reason they are "Fighting".
@cnnbrk And just what are you going to do about it? Probably just go ahead and confirm Kavenaugh as per Grahm and Trumps instructions. You work for the American People, not the Womanizing, Sex Offender Trump!
@PageSix Who Cares?
Dear Penthouse;	Me name is Mushroom,	"I was really being tough and so was he. And we were going back and forth, and then we fell in love. Okay? No really. He wrote me beautiful letters," Trump said. "They're great letters. We fell in love."
https://t.co/A1CUvUw70X
@RyanAFournier @hippychic88 I think your math is as Trumps. Millions? No. But, you will see what the power of MILLIONS is actually like come THIS November. Bank On It.
@SebGorka Nope. I'll pray for YOUR loss in November though.
@realDonaldTrump Oh, don't worry, Trump. We know when we are going to vote out ALL your Deplorable Repugnant Handlers.
@GOP @KellyannePolls Shut up you abused child. Daddy issues just spew from every ugly pore of your Racist Epidermal covering. Go iron something, you soulless shrew.
@USATODAY If laughter is the best medicines, Trump is providing the WORLD with the largest free Prescription coverage in the History of History.

@LaurenKataya61 @realDonaldTrump And soon to come, Trumps Children. Trump destroys lives. He boosts Friends income, but destroys those that matter. Yea, he is the ANTI-CHRIST.
@ATeamMom1 @meekobiscuit @realDonaldTrump He is NOT responsible for 85% of these things. He did not create anything, the economy is only better for the wealthy. Why would you post so obvious a fake news post. It's just deplorable to try and deceive. Get GOOGLE.

@DeadlineWH @NicolleDWallace Poor "Rosey The Racist". First she "Crotch Grabs" a stadium full of Fans, disrespecting the National Anthem of The United States, to making a true Deplorable Statement. This is what Repugnants are about. Dont blame sleeping pills. Sleeping pills did not cause it, Repugnancy did.
@Reuters Hey, Charlie Sheen blamed Crack Cocaine, and he still found work.	Hey, there are still an abundant of Cabinet posts in Trumps Cess Pool, I'm sure she would fit right in. Maybe give Sarah Huckabee a personality. Be her Racist advisor.
@Da_Godfather907 Hey Doc. You are a True Repugnant. You should be proud of your support for a racist. I think you should gather up your sheet and hood, and lead a rally in support of "Rosey The Racist" for the good of all your Repugnant Bretheren.

@FoxNews @TGowdySC I'm not at all a big fan of FAUXE News. Prefer the news that the Republicans did not make their staff lower their ethics so much, that they will never get another job anywhere else, other than the Sinclair Kingdom. How much does integrity cost, let alone your soul. Shame
@FoxNews @Comey @HillaryClinton @TheJusticeDept Republicans are scrambling to cover their own sixes. That's what they are doing. Lot of wool pulling going to happen.

@rachgrif24 @VP That is a True statement. trump is a delusionist. He believes eveything he says is true because he said it. And you incourage that.
@PaulaRe56252389 @cheryl_danley @CantTeachTrump @VP To those that say speaking out against trump is unpatriotic, should not cast stones.
@underwhelmed04 @lnelson082 @BurnsieMN @VP To actually believe that Trump has the interest of "Joe" is beyound belief.
@Ruthfulness @review_tom @casualbyfiat @VP Really? Where has he not lied about anything? Other than he could walk down the street in N.Y., and shoot and murder someone, and he still would have the support of his fans.
@VP I am sorry that a man of your integrity has to play second fiddle to a man that is so far your inferior. I know you were coerced into the second seat, and have to put up with a man that has no moral values. Stay strong.
