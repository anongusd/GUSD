@emdickerson97 she said she is too busy, and i was so dissapointed. I hope she didnt understand what i said and I took it wrong.
@emdickerson97 I heard olivia dont do twitter or facebook herself :-( I was dissapointed
@olivianj so I guess someone does those sites for her. So what is posted is not really Olivias words or feelings?
@olivianj she said she didnt do facebook or twitter, too busy.I was alittle dissapointed
@olivianj in Englewood i gave Olivia the GREASE call sheet book I had and said "I told you about this on twitter and facebook"
@olivianj :-(
@livcampaign and of course, theres an open invite for you and crew to my house whenever you all want :-)
