@ferrumite666 @thehill Absolutely... you would think our president has better things to do with his time, like running our country.  Maybe if he stops tweeting and having executive time and works this country would be a bit better off.  What a whining baby! https://t.co/5h2pYWUmYY
@latimes It‚Äôs hard to believe when they do it this way.  He is not here to defend himself.  They defended him years ago under oath.  All about money. Shame on HBO.

@thehill Wasn‚Äôt he just condemning SNL for their free speech?
@aeradtke @thehill Did you listen to what he said?   Hate groups - colleges would have to allow hate groups to speak on campus‚Äô.  WTF?  So the KKK could go to an all black campus and ask to speak and they would have to allow them to according to Trump.  He is tearing this country apart!

@thehill Why doesn‚Äôt the press just don‚Äôt show up in protest?   I know Fox is the only ones who will show because they work for Trump but really...enough already.
@NPR He has hurt victim‚Äôs rights and truth and justice across our world, if this is true.  All for his fame.  All for his advancement in his career.  What a sick man with his own hate.  He should be charged with a hate crime.
