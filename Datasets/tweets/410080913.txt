Mark Calabria's nomination to head FHFA narrowly passes Senate Banking Committe, while NCUA noms and Bimal Patel pass via voice vote. Story to follow.
ICYMI: The Senate is voting on Mark Calabria's nomination to head FHFA, next week, along with Bimal Patel at Treasury and Seth Appleton and Robert Hunter Kurtz at HUD. https://t.co/083fjsGM9n
(DC/Arlington is #6) https://t.co/cMyRMwg1w4
“We find it more likely than not that the FHFA Director sought to coerce or induce [Grimes] to engage in some sort of relationship with him that went beyond their existing ‘friendship’ and/or mentorship," said FHFA OIG. https://t.co/uQ0WefesMA
Here's our complete takeaway on the Calabria hearing. More confusion on WH housing finance reform plan and more pledges to work with Congress on the GSEs. https://t.co/gUAAImvPcA
Turns out romance isn't dead https://t.co/XYbTRk7fPs
If confirmed Calabria will "absolutely" maintain the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. "I have one myself and I'd like to keep it," he says.
Calabria tells Brown he interpreted Otting's comments to FHFA staff as a "pep talk" and to "convey a sense of urgency"
Calabria: "The very broad changes in mortgage finance have to be done by Congress."
Sen. Sherrod Brown opens today's hearing to examine the nomination of Mark Calabria by telling Chairman Crapo that he notices a lot more people on his side at the hearing as opposed to Crapo's. Here are 5 other things we're watching for: https://t.co/wyDIWmngYo
Expect Dems to grill him on affordable housing. He said this in 2012: “The existing resources available to community development would be more than enough to revitalize struggling communities across the country if local governments were run better..."
Will Mark Calabria give us any insight into the Trump administration's plan for housing finance reform tomorrow? And other things to look for: https://t.co/wyDIWmngYo
Rep. Sean Duffy says Mark Calabria is getting a Valentine’s Day hearing in the Senate next week.
Rep. Carolyn Maloney expresses concern that Sen. Crapo’s most recent housing finance reform plan lacks details on multifamily housing. Her district, NY-12- “lives vertically,” she says.
Hensarling: “If this is going to get done, it will get done by the August recess.” Says it gets harder the closer we get to an election year.
Shannon McGahn (who is moderating) asks Jeb about admin’s plan. He pauses and Frank says, “Your silence is eloquent, Jeb.”
Hensarling: “If Congress doesn’t act, apparently you do have an administration that is willing to act.”
Frank: “From 2011 to now... Republicans did nothing on Fannie and Freddie.” Hensarling responds saying he must have been reading a different history book.
I’m at @nardotrealtor Policy Forum on Housing Finance Reform this morning, first up listening to the unlikely panel of Barney Frank and Jeb Hensarling.
The House Financial Services Committee will hold not one, but two hearings next week on housing related issues: one on Feb. 13 about homelessness and one on Feb. 14 on affordable housing in rural America.

Here's everything you need to know about Sen. Crapo's GSE reform plan, to cap off quite the week in Fannie/Freddie news. https://t.co/MI0Y8XKrHO
The plan would turn Fannie and Freddie into private guarantors while allowing for other guarantors, and would utilize a Ginnie Mae securitization platform. The FHFA would be run by a bipartisan board of directors.

@martin_vargas89 @Fanniegate101 @SalvajeUnitario @Alec_Mazo @KarenPetrou You asked how it is possible to raise that amount of capital while in conservatorship, and I answered. I never said the Moelis plan will not happen and I never said it's not a recap and release plan- I'm just saying no one knows yet and here's why. Thanks for reading!
@martin_vargas89 @SalvajeUnitario @Alec_Mazo @Fanniegate101 @KarenPetrou I mean, take a look at the Moelis plan?
@Alec_Mazo @KarenPetrou I'm trying to point out that Otting has expressed that raising that amount of capital might be difficult. I don't know if he/the admin are planning to follow the route that Moelis proposed or not- I guess we'll in the next 1-3 weeks! Looking forward to it.
@Alec_Mazo @KarenPetrou “$6 [billion] to $150 billion is a big road, especially when you consider the earnings are, what, probably $11 billion a year?” Otting said. “So it’s like, how do we accelerate that, or what do we do to try to achieve that?"
@Alec_Mazo @Fanniegate101 @KarenPetrou Again, I'm not aware of a direct quote from Otting. The White House has recommended ending the conservatorships before- in fact, as recently as June. https://t.co/mObLGRjAx4
@Fanniegate101 @Alec_Mazo @KarenPetrou I'm not aware of any direct quotes from Otting that say "end conservatorship." Are you?
@Alec_Mazo @KarenPetrou If you read the story, we outline this. For example, we mention that Otting has not been quoted in reports as saying the admin is planning to pursue recap and release, instead promising "direction."
@Alec_Mazo @KarenPetrou Actually, we've written about the Moelis blueprint a few times, including the most recent update. https://t.co/MPY9sTfLCE
“I do not think that recap and release is what’s on the agenda, and I think there are significant indications in what Otting has said that that’s not the case,” said @KarenPetrou. More here: https://t.co/hSPu9upiZv

The question I couldn't answer in yesterday's podcast below: https://t.co/RpW4bwoCJ9
@amillionwaysdc @FHFA thanks for the answers!
I did a podcast and talked about Mel Watt and the #MeToo movement- check it out and try not to cringe at hearing my voice as much as I did https://t.co/7MctPlIFxF
The other #MeToo hearing on the Hill today: https://t.co/X52uqak6fn
"Don't you see that everyone is watching, sir?" asks Rep. Delaney
Watt says "there are no real consequences" for violating the FHFA's GSE lobbying ban
In explaining why he believes the FHFA's anti-harassment policy does not apply to him, Watt says, "To be clear, I am not above the law... if there's a determination that something's been wrong, there's no one in the agency that has the authority to take action against me."
Watt: "I am a big supporter of the #MeToo movement... but it cannot substitute for going through the legal process. To be honest, this committee can't deal with this in a legal way."
And now Rep. Wagner: "You do not hold yourself to the same standards that you hold your employees to."
Rep. Waters- who is friends with Watt- answers his question about why the committee allowed Grimes to testify: "It is a new time and a new day where we are not complying with existing policies that have worked against [women]."
Hensarling has pulled up the FHFA's anti-harassment policy, which he says he is exempt from as a presidential appointee
Mel Watt in his opening statement quotes the US Postal Service investigation: "Specifically, we never held hands, kissed or engaged in any sexual activity."
Rep. Wagner asks Grimes if she thinks Director Watt has affected the workplace culture at FHFA. "My opinion is yes," she responded.
Simone Grimes, who has accused Watt of sexual harassment: "My fellow employees have shared with me that they have felt the atmosphere shift inside the agency."
"I do believe there is one inescapable conclusion and that is that there is something amiss at FHFA."
Rep. Hensarling opens hearing on FHFA by quoting headlines from recent news stories. "These headlines are not fake news," he says. "The FHFA is in dire need of oversight."
Fitting that we end with a mortgage question, and Powell appears confident: "If we look at mortgage credit more broadly what we see is that credit is pretty widely available... and much less available to people with low scores and perhaps credit history.”
10 years after the financial crisis, the biggest lesson Powell takes away is the importance of maintaining financial stability. "We’ve done a lot. Nobody is overconfident that we’ve solved every problem."
Powell says he didn't have any input on Liang's nomination to the Fed board, but that he's "very happy and excited about the team that we’ve put together"
On if we still need the dot plot: "I think market participants generally find that interesting information."
Tariffs could provide a basis for companies to raise prices, but "until we see it in the numbers it’s hard to say how one would react."
“I think we’re always going to be adjusting monetary policy in light of conditions on the ground. If the economy is weakening, it’s very likely that we would be cutting rates.”
On trade war, Powell says the Fed isn't responsible for trade policy, but "we’ve been hearing a rising chorus of concerns from businesses across the country."
Powell, on whether the board has discussed Trump's comments on interest rate hikes: "We’ve been given a really important job to do on behalf of American people by Congress… my colleagues and I are focused exclusively on carrying out that mission."
Switching gears from housing finance today and covering today’s FOMC news conference. Stay tuned for Fed updates.
