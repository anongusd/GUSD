.@SenJackReed It's a very simple solution here. The House must pass the short-term Senate CR, so we can begin resolving the budget impasse.
.@SenJackReed A piecemeal approach to resolving the govt #shutdown will not work since the pieces are so critically interrelated #NoShutdown
.@SenatorBarb But if you open @NIH w/o @US_FDA, it's a hollow opportunity. These agencies work together to get safe products on the market.
.@SenatorBarb House is also coming up with a piecemeal approach to open @NIH. I absolutely want NIH open so they can continue their research
.@SenatorBarb Need all 3 agencies to process a veteran's claim. Without opening the entire government, we place our vets at a disadvantage!
.@SenatorBarb Other side says, we're going to fund veterans' benefits. But you cannot fund vets' benefits w/o reopening @SocialSecurity &amp;IRS
.@SenatorBarb Piecemeal does not work. You cannot do this one agency at a time. We need an open government. #NoShutdown
.@SenatorBarb The Senate CR would reopen the govt for 6 weeks while we work out fiscal problems. The House solution is to do this piecemeal.

.@SenatorBarb With our goal in December = we pass an omnibus bill that is affordable, sensible, meets human &amp; national security needs.
.@SenatorBarb Let's pass a CR that takes us to mid-Nov. Let's make that CR a clean CR, which means let's get rid of the political riders.
.@SenatorBarb Nov 15 keeps the pressure on both sides of the aisle to get the job done. To cancel sequester in a balanced way.
.@SenatorBarb I also want to have a shorter date. My recommendation would be around Nov 15, b/c a long-term CR means more govt on autopilot
.@SenatorBarb I want a clean CR. A clean CR = getting rid of the political riders of defunding #Obamacare &amp; striking the debt limit rider.
.@SenatorBarb American people are fed up with manufactured crises &amp; so am I. Let me tell you our view about where we want to go #NoShutdown
.@SenatorBarb House CR is a manufactured crisis, driving us toward a shutdown. We have plenty of real crises in our country #NoShutdown
.@SenatorBarb CR is not meant to be a vehicle for controversial, provocative, poke-it-in-your-eye, stick-it-to-you legislation #NoShutdown
.@SenatorBarb CR is meant to be short term, stopgap resolution as we work toward resolving matters. Designed to keep govt open #NoShutdown
.@SenatorBarb Let me explain it in a straight-talk way. CR = straightforward, simple act in which we extend the govt's funding beyond Oct 1.
.@SenatorBarb It also is designed to create a crisis over the debt ceiling &amp; undermine the full faith/credit of the United States of America
.@SenatorBarb The first thing it wants to do is defund the President's Affordable Care Act, to take away health care from those who need it.
.@SenatorBarb The CR that was sent over to us is loaded with political ideology.
