@amos_coates @BLACKSTEMUSA @PastorDScott When did this ever happen to prove your point?
@amos_coates @BLACKSTEMUSA @PastorDScott Our discussion was would raising wages hurt or help the economy. You claimed it would cause unemployment.

@amos_coates @PastorDScott @BLACKSTEMUSA Yes some people have stumbles in life. That doesn‚Äôt mean we just write them off. A rising tide lifts all boats bruh.
@PastorDScott @amos_coates @BLACKSTEMUSA All the richest folks in the country made their fortunes because working class folks bought their goods and services. Our current economic policies have left working folks with little to no disposable income. All their fortunes will vanish when folks can‚Äôt buy their stuff anymore
@PastorDScott @amos_coates @BLACKSTEMUSA Have either of you read Capitol by Thomas Picketty?? He is an economist and researcher. He stated in the book the last time there was this big of a difference between the 1% and the other 98% was right before the 1929 stock market crash.
@PastorDScott @amos_coates @BLACKSTEMUSA Yes and then gas was .29 cents a gallon, a loaf of bread probably cost about the same. The cost of everything we need to live has risen exponentially, but wages have not. It is far past time for a living wage increase.
@amos_coates @BLACKSTEMUSA @PastorDScott You ever read Henry Fords bio?? He went against the grain and paid his workers far above what was normal in that day and age. His peers thought he had lost his mind. When in actuality he sparked a revolution in wage fairness that led us to a strong middle class.
@amos_coates @BLACKSTEMUSA @PastorDScott I was just asking how would you know how $15 an hour would effect our economy. We have never had that for the majority of working folks.
@amos_coates @BLACKSTEMUSA @PastorDScott I did not mean it as an insult. I stated it as a fact. I would no more change the way I view the world and I‚Äôm sure you feel the same. That‚Äôs why I said we should just agree to disagree.
@amos_coates @BLACKSTEMUSA @PastorDScott I believe everybody came to this earth w a special purpose they were meant to accomplish. I do whatever I can to help them recognize their full potential and bring each of their best gifts to this world we live in.

@amos_coates @BLACKSTEMUSA @PastorDScott We have never had a $15 min wage so how would you know it would cause unemployment? You know this because the right wing said it is so?? Actually our country‚Äôs working class would have more disposable income and more spending power. Good chance our economy would grow

@knutsonmelissa1 @MyraMcknight00 @PastorDScott But what has been revitalized by private business here in the US?
@knutsonmelissa1 @MyraMcknight00 @PastorDScott To my point. Huge tax cuts were put into place and GM left. The majority of the beneficiaries of the tax cuts did stock buy backs. All that happened was a trillion plus added to the deficit. That is not something Trump should brag about.
@knutsonmelissa1 @MyraMcknight00 @PastorDScott I agree. But why is Trump and his supporters saying he invested 100 billion in the inner cities? Or that this Urban Revitalization Council is doing something grand to bring changed to urban areas?  That is incredibly misleading and basically false.

@knutsonmelissa1 @MyraMcknight00 @PastorDScott Hello?? I never got your response from my questions yesterday
@knutsonmelissa1 @MyraMcknight00 @PastorDScott My family works at GM also. We compared check stubs from a year ago and there is like $10 difference. How much more did you see on your checks? Just curious.
@knutsonmelissa1 @MyraMcknight00 @PastorDScott What are you referring to? The Envision Center was awarded in my city. But with $0 in funding.
@knutsonmelissa1 @MyraMcknight00 @PastorDScott I can‚Äôt imagine it. If tax cuts were the answer then why wasn‚Äôt investment spurred with the Trillion $$ + tax cuts they just got. Trump cut taxes, GM closed here and opened a Trailblazer plant in Mexico.
@knutsonmelissa1 @MyraMcknight00 @PastorDScott Allowed what?
@knutsonmelissa1 @MyraMcknight00 @PastorDScott I absolutely love love love the Envision Centers Program. Have you read it?? One of the best designed programs I have ever seen. But it‚Äôs like a cruel joke. Zero funding for it. What‚Äôs the point?
@knutsonmelissa1 @MyraMcknight00 @PastorDScott The Pres just gave a huge tax cut to the private sector. I didn‚Äôt see much investment. Where I live we lost our GM plant after 50+ years.
@knutsonmelissa1 @MyraMcknight00 @PastorDScott So just like the Envision Centers. Trump is investing zero dollars . Is this correct?
@knutsonmelissa1 @MyraMcknight00 @PastorDScott So does this basically mean the Trump administration is not investing cash into urban community but is offering tax breaks to private investors?? Is that correct?? They are estimating this will spur 100 billion in investment?? With no specific plan on what they are to invest in?

@FedupTrumpian @_JimminyCricket @PastorDScott Yes see, now all the racist garbage is surfacing. I knew it was in there somewhere. Stand in your truth. Don‚Äôt be a coward. If you would prefer a majority white America, say it. Don‚Äôt try to make up excuses why you don‚Äôt want immigrants of color to come.
@_JimminyCricket @FedupTrumpian @PastorDScott Because I challenge you to speak your truth does not in anyway make me a victim. You are blinded by your own hate filled heart. The people trying to come here are only looking for a better life. Why would you hate them for that?
@_JimminyCricket @FedupTrumpian @PastorDScott Yes please stop being in denial. You are so bold in your statements. Tell the whole truth. The only reason you do not want immigrants who happen to be people of color is because of your own racism. You think America is better off a majority white country. Speak your truth.
@_JimminyCricket @FedupTrumpian @PastorDScott In what way am I a victim? You displaying these pics of black people I don‚Äôt even know have nothing to do with immigration. What does this have to do w the issue of immigration? Please explain.
@_JimminyCricket @FedupTrumpian @PastorDScott Was it a math issue when millions of immigrants flowed into the country from majority white areas of the globe? Absolutely not. Stop trying to play this off. You only have an issue because of the color of their skin. Stop being a coward and stand in your truth.
@FedupTrumpian @_JimminyCricket @PastorDScott I count every human being as my fellow man. I don‚Äôt care if they come from Mexico, the Middle East, Norway or Denmark. They are all Gods children. Point blank period. All of you who rail against immigrants only have a problem with immigrants who happen to be people of color.
@_JimminyCricket @FedupTrumpian @PastorDScott So what are you saying? My defense of immigrants somehow makes me responsible for these pics?? You can‚Äôt be serious
@_JimminyCricket @FedupTrumpian @PastorDScott In the beginning of our convo Fedup said we wouldn‚Äôt have a choice of groceries because our shelves would be bare because of immigrants coming to the country.
@_JimminyCricket @FedupTrumpian @PastorDScott No one did worry how many Europeans came in the past, or how many are coming now. The issue of immigration is only a concern when it is about immigrants who are people of color.
@FedupTrumpian @_JimminyCricket @PastorDScott Fedup how can you say take race out of the equation when your whole convo was about race?? You are funny.
@FedupTrumpian @_JimminyCricket @PastorDScott It does not matter how many immigrants come, or by what manner of travel they arrive, the bottom line is they are fellow human beings looking for a better life. They are no better and no worse than millions of immigrants who arrived before them. They are all Gods children. Period
@_JimminyCricket @FedupTrumpian @PastorDScott And I didn‚Äôt make it a race issue, Fedup did. Thank you for dipping in our conversation.
@_JimminyCricket @FedupTrumpian @PastorDScott You said how many of these immigrants were arriving illegally, I simply pointed out to you that they are not arriving illegally whenit is legal for them to arrive and ask for asylum.
@_JimminyCricket @FedupTrumpian @PastorDScott That‚Äôs why I said you were dipping in our convo and didn‚Äôt know what you were commenting on. You must have jumped in somewhere in the middle.
@_JimminyCricket @FedupTrumpian @PastorDScott You couldn‚Äôt have it you would realize that Fedup jumped from us talking about Hillary‚Äôs hot sauce, to Trump choosing condiments in federal prison, and FedUp‚Äôs leap to immigrants, blacks, and birthright citizenry. We were discussing his racist tendencies.
@_JimminyCricket @FedupTrumpian @PastorDScott You never answered my question. How many ‚Äúwhite‚Äù immigrants are being held in detention centers?
@_JimminyCricket @FedupTrumpian @PastorDScott This is exactly what I meant. You jumped in the middle of our previous convo. Any immigrant arriving at a port of entry and asking for asylum is not entering illegally.
@_JimminyCricket @FedupTrumpian @PastorDScott Well first of all, I was having a discussion with another person and you jumped in not realizing what we already discussed. To get yourself up to speed go back and read the previous conversation friend.
@_JimminyCricket @FedupTrumpian @PastorDScott I was speaking of Europeans in the past. But since we are on the subject, how many Europeans or white immigrants from anywhere, are currently being held in detention centers?
@_JimminyCricket @FedupTrumpian @PastorDScott I actually tried to read it but couldn‚Äôt pull it up. I like to read and take into consideration all points of view.
@_JimminyCricket @FedupTrumpian @PastorDScott But the point remains that there is only one category of illegal immigrant you don‚Äôt want to see come here.

@residentmaryla1 @DrCilona @brycetache Every dictator who ever existed all used propaganda and the false narrative that the free press was the enemy of the people. That the press reported fake news. Every one of them. This is not a coincidence.

@residentmaryla1 @DrCilona @brycetache Hate and rage?? Because I‚Äôm concerned that Trump has duped his followers?? You are law enforcement right? How do you justify Trump telling multiple lies everyday?  That doesn‚Äôt concern you? Could we tell any young male to aspire to be like Donald Trump? I think not.

@residentmaryla1 @DrCilona @brycetache Are you really cool w him bowing down to Putin? Saying he is in love w Kim? Denigrating US war heroes? It is truly embarrassing. We are the laughing stock of the world right now.
@residentmaryla1 @DrCilona @brycetache Branch Davidians and Peoples Temple come to mind when I see the cult of Trump. Blindly, foolishly buying what he is selling.
@residentmaryla1 @DrCilona @brycetache Crack pipe really?? Well that‚Äôs very original. I‚Äôm not trying to insult you sir. I‚Äôm just pointing out the obvious. Most of America is very concerned that one third of the country has been brainwashed by Trump.

@RPatriotUSA @WBTV_News I think it‚Äôs safe to recognize Putin felt strongly that Trump was going to provide him w something that Hillary Clinton would not provide.
@RPatriotUSA @WBTV_News I think that was Putin‚Äôs hopes.

@RPatriotUSA @WBTV_News One thing that comes to mind is the false story that Hillary was sex trafficking children in the basement of a pizza shop. That by the way doesn‚Äôt even have a basement.
@RPatriotUSA @WBTV_News Ok now here you go friend. Don‚Äôt start making excuses. Let‚Äôs just agree that whichever of us is wrong we will be a good sport and admit it. How about that? Deal?
@RPatriotUSA @WBTV_News I cannot say why Obama didn‚Äôt act, or why Comey did not announce Trump was being investigated. That truly disturbs me.
@RPatriotUSA @WBTV_News I agree, I do not think anything will happen to those Russian military guys.
@RPatriotUSA @WBTV_News What those indictments showed me was how powerful our intelligence agencies are. Mueller knew each keystroke the Russian military guys made when they hacked. I feel confident that if Trump did do anything wrong, Mueller has found it and Mueller will tell us the truth about it.
@RPatriotUSA @WBTV_News Just promise me one thing. If Muellers investigation shows proof that Trump was involved or directed his staff/family to conspire w the Russians, promise me you will not make excuses for Trump. That‚Äôs all I ask.
@RPatriotUSA @WBTV_News One suspected reason is because Putin wants the Manitsky Act sanctions lifted. It is suggested that Putin feels like he could convince Trump to lift these sanctions, and Putin felt like Hillary would not lift them.
@RPatriotUSA @WBTV_News Actually the investigation started because Papadopoulus was drunk running off at the mouth and someone reported him bragging to our federal law enforcement. Then there was also the Steele dossier. This opposition research was actually started by Marco Rubio during the primaries.
@RPatriotUSA @WBTV_News Listen to yourself. Mueller is a Republican. He would have no reason to do this. An honorable man like Mueller would only be coming after Trump if he has found clear evidence that Trump has done something outrageous.
@RPatriotUSA @WBTV_News Absolutely. But not to limit voter participation, to increase it. Every single citizen should be mandated to vote. Like you are mandated to serve on a jury. The exact same way.
@RPatriotUSA @WBTV_News My question to you is why did Don Jr lie in a congressional hearing saying they never met w Russians until Jared told on him? If the meetings were nothing, why lie about them?
@RPatriotUSA @WBTV_News Trump never even denied writing the letter giving a fake excuse for meeting w the Russians. Don Jr. never admitted they met w Russians in Trump Tower until Jared Kushner told investigators about the meeting. Kushner told that. He may be who gave investigators a lot of their info
@RPatriotUSA @WBTV_News For what reason were they hacked? To diminish Hillary‚Äôs chances to win and to increase Trumps chances to win. These are facts. But why? Why would Russia care who became the next US President? Have you asked yourself that question?

@RPatriotUSA @WBTV_News I hear republicans criticize Mueller on a daily basis. Mueller is a republican decorated war hero. Why would he lie on a Republican President? You guys are not making sense or being rational. Almost all the investigators working for him are Republicans too. Explain that.

@RPatriotUSA @WBTV_News I‚Äôm very confident we will all see it when Muellers report is released. If I‚Äôm wrong I will admit. If you are wrong I hope you will admit it also.
@RPatriotUSA @WBTV_News The Russian military operatives who were indicted for hacking our systems work in the highest level of Putin‚Äôs regime. Like our military chiefs and generals. How can you compare that to a random Russian citizen making a donation to her husbands non profit.
@RPatriotUSA @WBTV_News How is a donation from someone in Russia to a non profit foundation the same thing as meeting with, plotting with, conspiring with Russia‚Äôs top govt officials w close ties to the Kremlin, even comparable??
@RPatriotUSA @WBTV_News And if all these meetings were on the up and up, why did Trump conspire w team members to write up a false explanation claiming the meeting was about adoptions? He directly participated!! Is that ok with you?
@RPatriotUSA @WBTV_News That is not correct Doc. Jeff Sessions met w a high ranking Russian operative at the Republican Convention in Cleveland. Mana fort, Kushner, and Don Jr met in Trump Tower June 2016. How is that after the election?
@RPatriotUSA @WBTV_News Yes Hillary‚Äôs emails and DNC servers were hacked. We know that for a fact. The information was released in a planned, orchestrated manner. Was it released in a coordinated effort w Trump campaign officials, family members or Trump himself? This is what the report will tell us.
@RPatriotUSA @WBTV_News You keep saying not one vote was changed, but you never said whether you would be man enough to accept Trumps criminal involvement if this is what Muellers report shows?
@RPatriotUSA @WBTV_News And it‚Äôs been proven that our voter registration systems were hacked in many states. How many names were purged from voter registration lists? How many voters had to file provisional ballots that were never even counted?
@RPatriotUSA @WBTV_News Do you really think that a million Russian trolls and bots spreading false information on social media in favor of Trump and against Hillary Clinton, you think that did not have an effect?
@RPatriotUSA @WBTV_News Did you think it was just fine for Trump to publicly invite Russia to hack Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails against US law??  Within hours of this invitation Russian military officers began their hacking. Just a coincidence? I think not.

@RPatriotUSA @WBTV_News We have gone over this before and you never responded. They hacked a few swing states to allow Trump to win the Electoral College. He only took the election by less than 100,000 votes in these few swing states. Out of 320 million people. Does that sound legitimate to you?

@RPatriotUSA @WBTV_News You keep saying their hacking did not change one vote. I just hope when Muellers report is finally released , if it says votes were changed by the hack, I just hope you will be man enough to admit it. If it shows Trump conspired w Russians you will admit he is a criminal.
@RPatriotUSA @WBTV_News One sided to who? Pres Putin said in Helsinki he wanted Trump to win. Our own US intelligence agencies all said Russia hacked the 2016 election in favor of helping Trump win. So what do you mean it‚Äôs been one sided?
@RPatriotUSA @WBTV_News When President Obama‚Äôs said that one thing to Putin that was in public, not in private.

@RPatriotUSA @WBTV_News What other Presidents of any other countries did they meet with? It is not common and every other President does not have a secret back channel to talk to any hostile foreign power on. Are you just making excuses for him or are you totally delusional?
