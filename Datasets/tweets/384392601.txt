17. @SenJohnMcCain @SenBobCorker @JeffFlake - the ability to change the arc of politics is within reach. Your move. (17/17)
16. Senators Jeffords &amp; Spector decided that no matter the cost to themselves, politics came second to patriotism.
15. Pres. Ford: “the bigger the issue, the greater the need for political courage.” No bigger issue now than the health of our democracy.
14. Pres. Ford once said that we need to reject leaders “who mistake the honest clash of ideas for a holy war.”
13. Underpinning all of that is the critical need for leaders to help reduce nuclear tensions - tensions made worse by this President.
12. On jobs, healthcare, taxes, education, climate change, the US needs competent, calm leadership.
11. Americans are tired of the political mess we are in &amp; they want to see cooperation &amp; collaboration in DC.
10. @SenSchumer should think about how Ds could accommodate politicians who actually put America first.
9. At the very least, they could help constrain the worst impulses of an increasingly unhinged President.
@SenJohnMcCain @SenBobCorker @JeffFlake 8. @SenJohnMcCain @SenBobCorker &amp; @JeffFlake could then insist Ds work with them on moderate, bipartisan legislation.
7. @SenJohnMcCain @SenBobCorker &amp; @JeffFlake can become Independents. If they caucus w/Ds, Senate balance power moves to 51-49.
6. Jeffords and Specter put country above party. They saw our nation was in danger &amp; put service above self.
5. I was in my 7th term when Sen. Specter (PA) abandoned a Republican party that he thought had abandoned its ideals and principles.
4. That move sent a shock wave through the Capitol. @washingtonpost said Jeffords "bent the arc of politics."
3. I was in my 3rd term in Congress when Sen. Jeffords (VT) switched from R to I changing the balance of Senate power from R to D.
2. But words are not enough. Dark times call for bold actions.
1. It's been great to hear recent remarks from @SenJohnMcCain @SenBobCorker &amp; @JeffFlake about Trump &amp; the state of our democracy.
Thank you-a pleasure. https://t.co/JlEfzdY0sn
