@ambernoelle @suzwoehrle I agree. I think that‚Äôs why You Got Mail was a disappointment.
@suzwoehrle @ambernoelle You've Got Mail is based on the 1937 Hungarian play Parfumerie by Mikl√≥s L√°szl√≥ and its adaptations. Parfumerie was later remade as The Shop Around the Corner, a 1940 film by Ernst Lubitsch, which in 1949 was adapted as a movie musical, In the Good Old Summertime by Robert Z.
