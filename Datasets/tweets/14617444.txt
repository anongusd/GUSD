A3 (2/3): Research has led to several drugs that block the function of 2 proteins with a role in driving cell multiplication—CDK4 &amp; CDK6—for treating HR+ #breastcancer resistant to drugs targeting the estrogen/estrogen receptor system. #EndoChat
A3 (1/3): Unfortunately, most advanced, hormone receptor–positive breast cancers that initially respond to drugs that target the estrogen/estrogen receptor system eventually progress because they have become treatment resistant. #EndoChat

A2: People at high risk of developing breast cancer can take drugs that target the estrogen/estrogen receptor system, such as tamoxifen and letrozole, to lower their risk of developing. #breastcancer #EndoChat
A2 (3/3): Other drugs, such as letrozole, are called aromatase inhibitors, they work by lowering the level of estrogen in the body. #EndoChat
A2 (2/3): Some drugs, such as tamoxifen, work by preventing the hormone estrogen from attaching to its receptor and thereby prevent estrogen from fueling the growth &amp; survival of HR+. #breastcancer #EndoChat
A2 (1/3): Hormone receptor–positive breast cancers are often treated with drugs that target the estrogen/estrogen receptor system. #EndoChat

Thank you @SenatorDurbin for being a stalwart champion of medical research! Your leadership and support for robust, sustained funding increases for @NIH and medical research at the Department of Defense means more life-changing discoveries for all Americans.
Thank you Senator @PattyMurray for your continued leadership and hard work to prioritize @NIH funding. Labor-HHS-Appropriations bill passed by Senate would provide $2B additional funding for investment in cures for patients and jobs in our communities.
Thank you Chairman @RoyBlunt for your visionary leadership and commitment to robust, sustained and predictable funding increases @NIH. The $2B increase approved by Senate would mark 4th straight year of remarkable investment in jobs, our economy, and the health of all Americans.

During today’s Senate Appropriations markup, @SenatorDurbin delivered powerful remarks in support of @NIH. Thank you, Senator, for being a consistent and strong champion of the lifesaving biomedical and cancer research funded by NIH and @theNCI!
As the Ranking Member on the Senate Labor-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee &amp; the Senate HELP Committee, Senator @PattyMurray’s leadership has been critical for ensuring bipartisan support for @NIH funding. Thank you, Senator, for your continued dedication to biomedical research!
Chairman @RoyBlunt had the vision to prioritize medical research &amp; put the @NIH on a path of sustained growth through robust &amp; predictable annual funding increases. Thanks to his leadership, the proposed $2 bil increase would put the NIH budget at 30% above where it was in FY2015
We’re grateful to Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman @SenShelby &amp; Ranking Member @SenatorLeahy for their continued support of funding increases for @NIH. If it becomes law, this $2 billion increase would mark the 4th year in a row that NIH has seen growth above inflation.

We are extremely grateful to Senator @PattyMurray for her continued leadership and strong support of @NIH as the Ranking Member on both the Senate Labor-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee, which funds NIH, as well as the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.
Thanks to the leadership of @RoyBlunt &amp; @PattyMurray, and the strong bipartisan support for @NIH, the proposed increase would mean a 30%/$9 billion budget increase for NIH between FY2016-19. These increases are helping fuel extraordinary progress in cancer &amp; biomedical research.
We would like to express our profound appreciation to Chairman @RoyBlunt for his exemplary commitment to medical research. Chairman Blunt set a goal for returning the NIH to a path of budgetary growth, and this proposed increase is a result of his leadership and vision.
We applaud Chairman @RoyBlunt and Ranking Member @PattyMurray for proposing a $2 billion increase for @NIH in the FY2019 Labor-HHS Appropriations bill. We're deeply grateful for their continued support of providing the NIH with robust, sustained and predicable funding increases https://t.co/HQ2HB18wWr

We're proud to join HPV experts from the nation’s top cancer centers, along with partners from @theNCI, @CDC &amp; @AmericanCancer for meeting June 7-8 in Salt Lake City to discuss a path forward for #EliminateHPVcancer, including ways to reduce #HPVvaccine barriers.
Research shows that barriers to improving #HPVvaccine rates include a lack of strong recommendations from physicians and many parents not being aware that this vaccine protects against several types of cancer in both men and women. #EliminateHPVcancers
The Dept of Health and Human Services, through the @GoHealthyPeople initiative, has introduced a goal of reaching 80% #HPVvaccine rates by 2020. Currently, 49.5% of girls &amp; 37.5% of boys in the US have completed the HPV vaccine series. #EliminateHPVcancers https://t.co/pvfJoNY2gB
During Cancer #Immunotherapy Month we will be featuring the top stories from our blog that focused on immunotherapy breakthroughs: FDA Approves Combo Immunotherapy for Kidney Cancer.  https://t.co/zlbBjFIj44 #CIM18 https://t.co/mYVJQkjQwg
The @CDC recommends all 11- to 12-year-old girls &amp; boys receive the #HPVvaccine. The vaccine is also recommended for young men up to age 21 and young women up to age 26. It’s most effective when administered before any exposure to HPV. #EliminateHPVcancers https://t.co/eFzDPbqOXW
According to the @CDC, about 41,000 new HPV-related cancers are diagnosed each year in the US. HPV is responsible for almost all cervical cancers, a substantial proportion of head and neck cancers, and the majority of anal, vulvar, vaginal and penile cancers. #EliminateHPVcancers
HPV will infect 75-80% of people at some point in their lives according to the @CDC. Nearly 80 million people are infected in the US, with 14 million new infections occurring every year. #EliminateHPVcancers https://t.co/Db97xpNx8V

Nicotine replacement therapy is substantially less harmful to health than cigarette smoking, but there are significant misperceptions among smokers and healthcare providers regarding safety of NRT. We recommend adding a claim on NRT packages to clarify misperceptions.	(4/4)
As not all smokers are ready to quit smoking (almost half who are planning to quit in next 12 months were interested in gradual reduction), the subcommittee recommends a reduce to quit approach with NRT, which has been shown to be more effective than placebo.	(3/4)
The subcommittee also recommends approving NRT for combination treatments, including use of short-acting and long-acting medications, and considering long term use of NRT to completely substitute for cigarettes in order to reduce harm to health. 	(2/4)
The AACR Tobacco &amp; Cancer Subcommittee recommends improving the appeal and nicotine delivery of nicotine replacement products (NRT) to increase uptake and efficacy of these smoking cessation products.	(1/4)
Dr. Hatsukami is the Associate Director of Cancer Prevention and Control at @UMN_Cancer. The AACR's Tobacco &amp; Cancer Subcommittee was convened in 2009 to foster scientific and policy initiatives to reduce the incidence of disease and mortality due to tobacco use. https://t.co/yBZFzIm8MM

We must continue to nurture and support a growing talent pool of future researchers and physician-scientists if we are to continue making progress against cancer. That is why we urge Congress to remove the proposed tax on graduate school tuition waivers. https://t.co/SK6XuuPGMH https://t.co/pd2MnWvgSh
Being able to deduct the cost of medical treatments can provide financial relief to patients. The proposed elimination of medical expense deductions could effectively increase cancer patients' financial burden. We urge Congress to remove that provision. https://t.co/HWM30jgN80 https://t.co/k9yzSqNgAo
