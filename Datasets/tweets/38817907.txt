@ifixspinz @DanRather Everything was given to the FBI at that point.  Part of our notarized accountability statement is to tell the public everything.  This was never about Trump it is about violating USC.
@ifixspinz @DanRather When that happen everything was sent to the Federal Reserve Board who took steps to stop the damage being done to the United States economy. In 2018 the Federal Reserve Board filed a CFPB complaint. Mick Mulvaney's CFPB closed that complaint the same way.
@ifixspinz @DanRather The 2016 White House filed CFPB complaints. When Trump was sworn in he was sent this information.  Mick Mulvaney's CFPB closed the complaints without doing any investigation or holding the banks accountable.
@ifixspinz @DanRather If you are talking to me then you are in for a bit of a shock.  In 2016 JP Morgan Chase's greed caused my company's accountability statement to kick in. This required reporting all  problems encountered to the FBI, Federal Reserve &amp; the White House.
