@astrusz I have more tweets than you. Neener neener.
@NathanFillion I see you are using your fame to your advantage. Nice work!
I have to beat @astrusz at tweets. Two more and I'm ahead.
Why do people who never use Twitter have it? Is it really that hard to find the "Deactivate my account" button.
@TIME "Missing: King Tut's penis" That's ackward.
