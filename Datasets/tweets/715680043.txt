Isn’t this an interesting headline. They just need to add late term abortion, bankrupting the country through free college and healthcare, higher taxes, killing jobs and the economy while instituting socialism and they would have nailed it. https://t.co/iage2xnn9V

@KamalaHarris Anyone who will not vote to save the life of a human being existing outside of a mother as I being born is disgusting &amp; should not remain in government. Explain how you voted for letting babies die, not a fetus but a living baby that has been born. How is that women’s healthcare
@KamalaHarris So now someone can’t go bankrupt and we must pay for their mistakes.  Do you realize working hard and finding and keeping a job while being responsible with your wages &amp; life will get one a long way without government intervention constantly. How about making private Ins better
@teb_art @BryanMinehart @yarmiganosca @AOC In 2001 ICE became a separate agency because it was split from customs.
This should be put on billboards.  She is reckless She is claiming a DOJ agency is lawless, unaccountable , and commits heinous crimes.  Every ICE employee should demand an apology. @dbongino I am sure you might mention this Monday. I can’t wait. https://t.co/xWfgQBdfxB

@tedlieu @HowardSchultz Ted, maybe you think that was democracy but most people agree with Howard. It was a spectacle. Cohen stated Trump was just marketing his Brand.

@katystoll @dbongino E V I D E N C E.     That is all.  Where is your evidence.   State one fact that shows Donald Trump colluded with Russia to effect the US Presdential Election. That is what he is being investigated for. Simply one FACT!
@KamalaHarris And all crimes committed by the FBI, DOJ and others in the FISA process and applications for warrants on a political adversary without factual basis should be identified and prosecuted. All personal associated with these acts should be publicly named, investigated and charged
@SenFeinstein Did your driver tip you off to this ?
@KamalaHarris Define “Assault weapon” please!
@KamalaHarris You are completely against hard work and struggle. I have worked 2 jobs before. You know what, it made me appreciate hard work and sacrifice. Giving things away does not make it all better. Hard work and sacrifice are key to success.  Why can’t you see this?

@tedlieu Such an eloquent response. What. No lies to tell. Maybe Adam Schiff can help you with an actual factual response next time.
@KamalaHarris Will you not take money from teachers unions.  Planned parenthood.  SEIU. AFL-CIO.  What about labor unions. Are you going to take millions from them?
@PattyMurray @BetsyDeVosED So you realize schools are already failing at this. Stop taking so much money from teachers unions and start caring about children. You should be pro school choice.  There is no proof what you say will happen will actually occur
@KamalaHarris Are you for school choice?  Choice provides competition and competition will improve schools or they will fail.  Prove you are really prepared to help children. Don’t take money from teachers unions.  Put kids first with school choice and grants and charter schools.
@funder Did you forget Bill Clinton frequented his island or is bringing up Trump just politically convenient. How about Senator Melendez?  Funny how his Democratic associations are never mentioned.

@ReElectNydia Are you going to use it? What is the fastest you can hope to get from DC to LA?  How many roads must you cross at a high speed?  How much more fuel?  BTW we already have planes &amp; not the trains you speak of. Cost estimate and who is paying? You can’t answer can you??? Tweet me!

@RealJamesWoods Funny how terrible the Right was when the statue of limitation argument was brought up when judge Kavanaugh was accused.  It is suddenly that the  statue of limitations is an out for liberals. I love it. Remember Sen Melendez. I did not commit any crimes on US Soil.
@PattyMurray @leahegriffin That is awesome. What is your opinion of the accusers rights for the asst governor of Virginia and the accuser in New Jersey. How do you feel about those rights. Do you believe them too.
@PattyMurray Did you vote no on Eric Holders nomination who was held in contempt by congress for not cooperating. Loretta Lynch who was a pawn to President Obama and met Bill Clinton during the election and Hillary’s campaign. You didn’t have a problem with them.
@KamalaHarris This is beyond stupid. Tell me how do you give everyone a living wage including those unwilling to work for it. How do we abolish fossil fuels in 12 years.
@PattyMurray You are screeching. It is law &amp; he alone cannot change it.  Why don’t you propoose abortion on demand and letting live aborted babies be killed This is garbage and you know it. You are a US Senator. You have the power to legislate do it!  See who backs you!

@SenSanders None of that has anything to do with Freedom.  That is where your ideology is so skewed. The government providing something is not freedom. The choice to choose or earn what it is you desire is freedom. We are a country based on liberty. Not government services.
@ananavarro That is a pretty despicable and bigoted thing to say.  I am really surprised by this level racism.  You would never say the opposite to Maxine Waters or President Obama

This is what disturbs me about this article: A Northam ally, Senate Minority Ldr Richard L. Saslaw (Dem)defended the governor.	“His whole life has been about exactly the opposite and that’s what you need to examine, not something that occurred 30 years ago https://t.co/yKWRSLlZAS
@PatsPokesNSox @JohnCooper0610 Sure. here is my question? As the father of an unborn child what rights do I have. Can I stop the mother from getting an abortion? No. No rights for the father. I agree with taking responsibility it is the mothers killing their children unless the father pays for it the it’s both
@ananavarro It hounded her because it was ridiculous and absurd that she claimed it in the first place and held onto it so tightly.  Why does she need to apologize. If she becomes president she will be the first 1/ 1 billionth Native American President.

@PattyMurray What does a wall not do for border security? Isn’t the purpose of security to keep something or someone secure. Why does CBP say the wall works?  Why are you such an obstructionist.  You want to negotiate as long as you get your way.
@KathyKLTran You said it! As the baby is ready to come out of the mothers womb &amp; into the world.  Up to that point the woman has a choice. So in your own words life does not begin until the baby is completely outside of the mother. I think you should describe how a full term baby is aborted.

@JohnCooper0610 @PatsPokesNSox Ofcourse!    I see now. It is all a mans fault.  Blame men. Maybe less toxic masculinity will solve our abortion problem.
@KamalaHarris We have seen law makers become millionaires while staying in office for years and years.  No one I know in sales making a similar annual salary of senators and congress has amassed the wealth of our lawmakers. Let’s start there!!!

@McAllisterDen Amen.
@KamalaHarris But late term abortion is ok?
@GovernorVA You said and I Quote “I can tell you exactly what will happen”. You then went on to describing resuscitating and that a decision will be made. Why don’t you tell us what decision needs to be made after a live birth! Pretty simple question. Live baby, what do you do governor?

@GovernorVA Maybe the children should have your support. Or their parents. Oh wait.  Maybe some of these kids have birth defects or are not viable and you wouldn’t want to support their lives.  Just teachers.
@GovernorVA What about babies born with Burt defects or where once deemed non viable?  Can they go to church?

Anyone tweeting about tear gas at the border understand this: when the left marches, riots &amp; destroys property in US Cities and these riots are broken up with tear gas and police, I don’t ever hear them worried about the citizens in the area of the problem who have children.

Why does the left want to get rid of free speech?  Get rid of transparent elections where only citizens vote? Open our borders? Condemn and prosecute law enforcement? Promise what they know they cannot deliver? Create Mobs and destroy liberty?

@SenatorMenendez She has nothing to lose. Everyone loves her now. She has money in the bank. Never gave specifics. Didn’t even know the investigative team was willing to fly to California, who paid for her polygraph, or that her lawyers reported she was afraid to fly.
@SenatorMenendez You are a senator and that is your lame argument.  When you were in Central America not breaking US law and sleeping with teenage girls were you this scrutinized? What did you have to gain.  Can the FBI investigate you some more?  Maybe 6 times.
@BlissTabitha What a narcissist
@jaketapper @CNN Then why has his drinking not come out in past background investigations.  Why did no one ask home if he was an alcoholic, ever treated for alcoholism, drank until he blacked out, passed out, fell down, lost memory etc.  there was an opportunity for this
@CrochetJanet @Suki_Sjoekje @JerryWi22764395 @KamalaHarris So you want your tax dollars spent on making sure there is a park within 10 minutes of all 330 million Americans.

@Suki_Sjoekje @JerryWi22764395 @KamalaHarris Are you going to take people to the park for the benefits. This is insanity and you are all jumping on it like this is even remotely possible.  Get your ass outdoors.  Take a bus.  Ride a bike.  Uber.  Walk!!!   WTF. Only liberals could come up with this
@Chris_Bradberry @osendepaul @KamalaHarris You are insane.  Get out of the city. We need free health care. Free education. Free medicine.  Free housing. Where does this end.  I love the outdoors.

@KamalaHarris explain how in the freaking world you are going to pay for this and enforce it. Who has to give up their property to build the socialist park owned by all.  This is the so ridiculous.  How about the “Get some common sense act” and the “Stop the stupidity act”  lunacy!  Insanity!
@KamalaHarris You have got to be kidding me!   Everyone needs a park within 10 minutes?   GTFO.  Get The F*!@ Outside!!!   Live your life.  When will the government and liberals stop trying to wipe everyone’s ass by doing everything for them. Do you get a free Uber to the park and free WiFi!!!

@philipaklein Exactly. She was not prepared for this type of situation. She performed terrible. There should have been a list of specific questions numbered by priority from each senator.  Kavanaugh is done in my opinion
This is pathetic.  She won’t speak with Republicans and the prosecutor is wasting her 5 minutes for each person and accomplishing nothing.
What did that accomplish?   Can we ask her some questions.  When did the remodel of her house happen with the second front door?  Did she tell her husband then?
Ofcourse she is a guest of Sen Feinstein.  How ironic. Just yesterday she was leading an angry mob through the senate. Somehow we are supposed to believe this isn’t a con job and set up to get rid of Kavanaugh while this is happening https://t.co/PJQdTcXwUv

@michaelrburris @CAndreola211 @CERTD5 @paulsperry_ Please explain?   How did Kavanaugh create this?    That statement is absurd and makes no sense.  He was initially accused by an unnamed source. Then a named source and he has denied it repeatedly and wants to testify. So explain how he caused this?

@ChrisVanHollen @SaraCarterDC @charliekirk11 You are a senator from Maryland!!!!   Demand the local authorities investigate and take a statement from the victim and witnesses. This is your State and what are you doing?!
@ChrisVanHollen @SenFeinstein What if the allegations were made aagainst you?  Why must the FBI investigate? They have no jurisdiction over an alleged assault from 36 years ago in Maryland.  As a Senator are you truly this misinformed and partisan?  Why don’t you demand an investigation? Your from Maryland?
@KamalaHarris Quit being such a hypocrite!!!!
@KamalaHarris I am sure you will take a stand and use the same smear tactics and allegations to get all democratic abusers and sexual predator out of your party now that you stand and demand justice for all victims!
@KamalaHarris I am sure you will ask that all of Bill Clinton’s victims be given a voice and apologize for the way the democratic women have treated them for years
@KamalaHarris I am sure them you will ask Sen Menendez to design since he likes underage girls in Central America. Didn’t break any US laws though as he stated?  Or did he?
@KamalaHarris If they are not here legally why should the get US Benefits?   Why do you chose for laws to only apply to groups you are against?   Why do my tax dollars not benefit me as a citizen and other citizens?  I am not paying taxes to help people who shouldn’t be here.
What I find so interesting about the leftist attacks on Kavanaugh is it comes down to liberals fear of any curtailment on abortion. The On demand killing of viable human beings who happen to be inside of their mothers.  They will argue an unproven accusation to protect killing

Were you present at the meeting with Susan Rice, Brennan and President Obama discussing the dossier I’d much rather hear you talk about what you knew https://t.co/lLFitgF2P4
@CNN @jaketapper  no mention of The FBI and local LE not taking any actions on the reported threat this young man posed to the community and school. So guns are a warning or red flag but actually stating you may kill people at a school can be ignored by LE.  Where is the outrage https://t.co/7XqyMNepDi
@madeleine  so easy to point gingers where is this outrage at all of this happening under President Obama.  Did you read the dates?  Back to 2014 so the President you are upset about is obviously the previous Democrat. Trumps only been in office a little over a year. https://t.co/vjqQZpCxui

3.  People commit these crimes. Not guns. Stop putting the criminal allover the news. Black out the perpetrator and give them zero coverage across the board. Never name them. Remove all possibility of notoriety so they are not motivated to go out in a blaze of “glory” for ego
2. Would the left attack the persons religion?  What if they were Muslim? Would the left demand government protection and the right for PP workers to protect themselves? All their arguments are invalid because they are ideological and never based on facts!
1. COMPARISON:  if one posted a video claiming they were the king of planned parenthood bombings and it was sent to the FBI. The person bombed a planned parenthood facility: 1 would the left be silent or defend the FBI. 2 would the left go after bomb making equipment?

@HillaryClinton 15 million a year to create jobs. You get 15 million for speeches to wall street.  Why do you tax the middle class so much
@HillaryClinton bull puckey. Strengthening unions outs donations in your pockets and voted in the democrats ballot box. I'm for Johnson/weld
@HillaryClinton no new taxes. Is this with the 25% and 28% you want to take from lower and middle class Americans with your tax plan?
@HillaryClinton isn't that calling the pot calling the kettle black. Who have you helped through your foundation?
@HillaryClinton wow. So proud of you!!!  How about a press conference ?  Media is protecting Clinton
@timkaine @HillaryClinton what is housing discrimination? Can you define it? If your credit sucks you get discriminated against? Bad Banks!
@HFA @HillaryClinton There are many free ways to do that right now. Why must we spend tax dollars to do it? Teachers should want to improve
@HillaryClinton so release all your contributors and their dates and contribution amounts to your foundation. When is that going to occur?
@HillaryClinton and you run a foundation reviewing BILLIONS and pay no taxes on it. You're kidding me You pay taxes on all speeches???
@BernieSanders @politico @HillaryClinton get it done now so Hillary won't have to when she gets elected. We wouldn't want her lying to us!
@OnMessageForHer and everyday journalist are out there lying for Hillary and covering for her atrocities. America should be outraged!!!
@SheriffClarke @FoxNews message to NFL. Find your own security. LE should stop working games and let the NFL provide all their own security
I can't either so let's get out and vote for Johnson/Weld in 2016!  https://t.co/yCK1OhVl24
@HillaryClinton how about launching a press conference???
@HillaryClinton How is a 25% tax on workers making 37-91k helping the middle class?  What about this works? https://t.co/Glma7W53o2
@11EdgarMartinez love the attitude and the confidence  back to back sweeps. Keep bringing M's

@LeBatardShow @brbuettner YOU DON'T GET THE SHOW!!!
@OKC2796 @LeBatardShow YOU DON'T GET THE SHOWWW!!!!
@Kevin_Martinez @RaijaPapaya will be rooting for the Mariners from Portland.
@CShays if you can't support Trump why go Hillary. Go Johnson / Weld. They support what you say you will do if elected. Hillary does not
@BernieSanders it is time for citizens to be respectful of law and order and respect each other and law enforcement. Quit blaming cops!!!
@DLoesch @nypost I am tuned out. I can't watch. They should spread it out and show us everything.  NBC has ruined the olympics for us
@clackamascounty that is great news. Than cut property taxes!!!!
@clackamascounty use the money you already get. You must have incredible revenue based on the wealth in this county. Quit asking for more
@sallykohn and Hillary can't stop telling Fibs and let's a terrorists Dad sit behind her and cheer. She is to be trusted?
@HillaryClinton here is what Honest people say about Hillary Clinton. She is a Liar and cannot stop Lying
@HillaryClinton Orlando Terrorist Murderer who target a LGBT nightclub's FATHER supports Hillary. She should refute this immediately
@HillaryClinton so will your campaign get question about left wing hate groups that support you Orlando terrorist murderer Dad supports you
@OnMessageForHer @AnnCoulter yes. You are correct. The DNC and the media are implicit in hiding a lot of things about Hillaer
@CNN what would the world do with you informative timely cutting edge news that is so relevant to all the things going on In The world?
@HillaryClinton who are your biggest donors?  Had a check up lately?
Can you find Emma and I  https://t.co/pwdBQIEKet
@HillaryClinton what did you do when you faced a crisis. Benghazi???  Libya???  Iran??  Go delete some more emails.
@elizabethforma @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump so why did Bernie constantly point out Hillary's ties to Wall Street. Now it doesn't apply?
@elizabethforma @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump what if they claim to have Native American ancestors. Do they get a bigger tax break?
@CNN why do you always bring up negative groups who support Trump. Socialist and communists support Hillary. You don't ask her about that
@CNN. Read this!   The Main Stream media will never report it.  https://t.co/219hDKb1k4

@TheRalphRetort is this true. If so where is the media reporting on this
@HillaryClinton @HoustonChron since when is the media conservative anyway. That's like saying planned parenthood endorsed you
@HillaryClinton so tell us your plan and strategy for doing so. Haiti isn't better off. Libya is not better off. The Middle East is a mess
@HillaryClinton soy ligand a good week. Libya is entirely on you according to your staff email. You keep lying about your emails and Libya
@HillaryClinton @timkaine leave our guns alone. Chicago is an example of how banning guns does not work
@HillaryClinton so lower taxes. Increase the work force by reducing welfare. Increase energy jobs. Simplify the IRS code and cut spending
@HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump Americans have questions about your truthfulness. We have issues with your coziness to Iran, and many more
@HillaryClinton @CoryBooker then why can't she tell the truth. Why did she hire Debbie WS after the DNC emails with racist messages?
RT @Mariners: It's a special number to Ken Griffey Jr. Now, it's officially his forever. #24EVER		#24Stories | The Number	https://t.co/kZuD…
@HillaryClinton are you telling us under a democratic president these freedoms were taken away???  Who has been in office anyway?
@HillaryClinton I believe it clearly states Americans. And I believe that to be US Citizens. Not anyone living on the continents
@HillaryClinton ensure all voters are US Citizens and registers voters in the correct precinct. Just like you check ID at your convention

@HillaryClinton we have ways to stand up to and reject the kind of BIGOTRY that was found on the DNC servers. We just hire Debbie!!!
@HillaryClinton and you still can't admit you have lied to congress and the American people even if you didn't lie to the FBI.
@HillaryClinton why can't you say something about Ginny Thrasher. 1st American Gold!  A woman with a Gun!!!
@HillaryClinton how do you feel about the Lebanese team blocking the Israeli team from boarding g their bus to the opening ceremony?
@clackamascounty NO NEW TAXES. Why do you always need more from us. Learn to live on your own budget stop dipping into ours

@GrantP22 agreed!!!
@GrantP22 I was joking.  If anyone thinks this was not a ransom payment they are stupid or a democrat
@realDonaldTrump focus on Hillary and keep your trap shut about everything else. The media will always hate you, get over it and crush HRC
@GrantP22 @realDonaldTrump I think you can begin to focus on Hillary now. Can't someone get him to watch Clinton Cash &amp; Hillary's America
@BreitbartNews are you kidding me?  He doesn't speak additional languages. Why must Dems always push agendas on others and not themselves?

@CNN of course you never imagined this. You are to short sighted and locked into Hillary and Dem women to imagine other woman succeeding
@HillaryClinton you should stop taking money from foreign governments
@HillaryClinton how about using what the government already gets and leave the citizens, rich and poor alone. When is enough, enough?
@DLoesch Glock 43
@clackamascounty will tax everything and everybody. Cut the fat and support the residence with what you already have!!!
@clackamascounty spend what you get We aren't getting pay raises and asking for more money every year. You work for us. Richest county

@clackamascounty I have an idea. I'll keep my money and spend it on me. You keep your money and fix the road. #AlwaysWantingMore
@clackamascounty show us how much you are getting already. We pay highest gas prices in US already. NO NEW TAXES
@sallykohn which cheeks. Face or???
@HillaryClinton can't trust a liar either. Have to go with Gary Johnson.
@CNN I don't want a friend.  I want a LEADER. At least we know the DNC can build a wall and even expand it when they want to keep people out
@CNN you would never talk about the Bush Twins the way you do about  Chelsea. I would say Trumps kids turned out excellent.

@AlanaKStewart @DineshDSouza watch Clinton Cash too
Does anyone believe Hillary Clinton is honest her about taxes?  Tim Kaine: Is a joke! Three words: Clinton Global Initiative
This should be good. Why Tim Kaine  trusts Hillary Clinton. Passion = character. Hillary has passion for kids and family so we should trust?

When is the DNC and democrats going to demand all other flags be removed from hall EXCEPT the American flag?
When are the democrats going to support the law enforcement and ask for people to stop the violence against police?
When am I going to hear that Hillary has stood by our Military?  Our Veterans?  Our military widows and children left w/o a mom or dad?
