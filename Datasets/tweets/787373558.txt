I urge Leader McConnell to bring these measures up for a vote in the Senate, and for President Trump to work with Congress to allow the government to get back to work in service to the American people.
I am proud to have voted for each of the eight measures Democrats in the House of Representatives brought to the floor to end the shutdown and provide funding to government agencies.
I am glad to have voted to pass legislation to provide federal employees with back pay once the shutdown ends, but that does little to alleviate the pain of our nation‚Äôs public servants who went from living paycheck to paycheck, to paycheck to no check.
The more than 23,000 Maryland-based federal employees who are furloughed or working without pay have already missed one paycheck, and are now forced to contemplate the possibility of going an entire month ‚Äì or even longer ‚Äì  without pay.
Every day the shutdown continues, the pain felt by the over 800,000 affected federal workers only increases as anxieties about how to pay rent, cover medical expenses, and provide for their families deepen.
The American people deserve to have their government back at work for them, and federal employees deserve their pay.  Our government must be better than this.

Allowing discrimination and harassment to go unchecked can have serious consequences on the lives and careers of those who are interested in government service.
This bill will give federal interns the same protections already provided to federal employees. This is a great start, but more must be done. I urge my colleagues to also support the Unpaid Intern Protection Act, which would give interns outside of government similar protections.
The act of harassing unpaid interns on the basis of race, religion, age, or sex is not currently prohibited by federal law. Under existing law, victims rely on the discretion and integrity of managers to prevent this behavior.
I am pleased that the House passed my bill, the Federal Intern Protection Act, to close a loophole in federal employment law that currently leaves unpaid interns open to discrimination and sexual harassment without any legal recourse.		https://t.co/RVLTsHRUJI

Because of the Trump shutdown, more than 2.3 million Marylanders may not get their tax refunds on time. Today, I voted to fully fund &amp; open the IRS. I urge the President to work with Democrats to open the IRS &amp; ensure that hardworking Americans receive their tax refunds on time.

Mr. President, you promised the American taxpayers they would not have to pay for your border wall - which will not give us effective border security, no matter who pays. Please work with Congress to allow the government to get back to work in service to the American people.
Federal workers are bearing the burden of this shutdown. More than 23,000 Maryland-based federal employees are affected by this shutdown and do not know when they will get paid, creating anxieties about how to pay rent, cover medical expenses, and provide for their families.
Mr. President, this shutdown has gone on for far too long. The American people deserve to have their government back at work for them, and federal employees deserve their pay. Our government must be better than this!
I commend her longstanding commitment to Howard County and to ensuring that the police department reflects the community it serves.
Congratulations to Lisa Myers for being named Howard County's next Police Chief! Hailing from a long line of law enforcement officers in her family, Chief Myers will make history as the first African American female Howard County Police Chief. https://t.co/MygZWPKZfo

My priority will be to restore rigorous, responsible, and fact-based oversight while focusing on issues that affect the American people every single day.
The American people spoke clearly in this election. They voted for the checks and balances that are mandated by the Constitution, and they voted for greater transparency and accountability in government.
I am humbled and honored to be the next Chairman of the primary investigative body of Congress.
I just voted in favor of legislation to end the Trump shutdown. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to pass the legislation &amp; for President Trump to sign it into law. The American people deserve to have their government back at work for them &amp; federal employees deserve their pay.

My thoughts and prayers are with Marlene's family and friends as they mourn her passing.
Marlene and Stewart joined me over 20 years ago in founding the Elijah Cummings Youth Program, which has strengthened the bonds between youth in Israel and African American children in the 7th Congressional District of Maryland.
Marlene dedicated her life not only to fighting cancer, but also to uplifting the young people in our community.
In 1996, Marlene and her husband Stewart donated a record $10 million to the University of Maryland‚Äôs cancer center, which is now named the University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center in their honor.
After a battle with cancer, Marlene dedicated herself to ensuring that everyone in Baltimore had access to cancer care regardless of their zip code or wealth.
I am saddened to learn of the passing of Marlene Greenebaum. Marlene was a devoted member of the Baltimore community who constantly and generously brought life to life.		https://t.co/SvNBeSLj33

Our nation‚Äôs public servants working or furloughed during this shutdown deserve the peace of mind of knowing they will be paid. I am pleased to cosponsor and support bipartisan legislation in the House that ensures federal employees affected by a shutdown receive retroactive pay.
However, the President and Congressional Republicans decided to proceed with this shutdown because of the President's demand that taxpayers foot the bill for his border wall; the same wall the President promised the American people they would not have to pay to build.
This shutdown was completely avoidable, and Congressional Democrats offered multiple options to keep the government open.
At midnight, President Trump and Congressional Republicans forced the government to partially shut down.  Because of this shutdown, over 800,000 federal employees will go without pay over the holiday season.		Read my full statement: https://t.co/BBNRIwdcok

The MERCY Act takes a strong step toward eliminating this barbaric practice, to ensure our youth have a chance to be rehabilitated and become contributing members of their communities.
I am pleased that my bill, The MERCY Act, was included in the final bill. Compounding incarceration with solitary confinement can break a young person‚Äôs spirit beyond repair, and it can have devastating long-term impacts on their mental and physical health.

The health and safety of our students must always be our number one  priority.
They must now urge President Loh to rescind his resignation and continue his strong leadership to put the proper protocols in place and ensure another tragedy like the death of Jordan McNair never happens again.
The right decision was finally made by the UMD Board to part with Coach Durkin.
Congratulations to @HarborCDC for being awarded $400,000 from the @USMBDA! I am proud of The Harbor Bank for its innovation in supporting minority-owned businesses, and I am pleased that the U.S. Department of Commerce recognizes their life-changing work in our community.
Dr. Loh‚Äôs priority has always been the education and wellbeing of UMD students. His departure will cause even more disruption to an unsettled campus environment.
I still don‚Äôt understand ‚Äì and am concerned about ‚Äì¬†what exactly led President Loh to offer his retirement while the leadership of the football program remains intact.
The tragic death of Jordan McNair showed that there is a toxic climate within the football program at UMD. I am not satisfied with the remedies enacted by the University System of Maryland to ensure this never happens again.
Healthcare is a right, not a privlige.
I intend to fight to my last breath to keep the ACA, to ensure that people have access to healthcare.
I am proud that Maryland has embraced the ACA to help people in our state get healthcare.
There is no denying that Americans want healthcare.
Today, I am here begging you to not let anything stand in your way and prevent you from enrolling in a health insurance plan.
The deadline to sign up is December 15th.

#Opioids kill 134 people a day, but only 1 in 10 people with addiction are getting treatment. This crisis does not discriminate based on politics‚Äîit is devastating families in red states, blue states, and purple states.
#POTUS signed an #opioid bill that takes small steps that I support, but this is the most devastating public health crisis in a generation, and the crisis will only get worse if we do not significantly expand funding for treatment.

Finally, the Constitution gives Congress, not the President, the power to declare war. The President must obtain congressional authorization to use military force in Syria, and it is unacceptable that he did not do so before ordering tonight's military action.
However, responding with violence will not bring peace. The previous airstrikes ordered by President Trump have not helped bring stability to this country and they certainly will not help now. Moreover, we must open our arms to those fleeing this conflict.
Earlier this week we were reminded of the horror and tragedy that millions of Syrians experience every day. The use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime is unforgivable and cannot be tolerated.

So I commend Chairman Gowdy for taking this preliminary step. But obviously‚Äîobviously‚Äîthe credibility of this investigation will be judged by how thorough it is in obtaining documents and interviewing witnesses, and how bipartisan it is in its conclusions.
It is no secret that I have been extremely frustrated that our Committee has done nothing over the past year to address the completely dysfunctional security clearance system at the White House, despite my many requests. 	https://t.co/kjQm8MiiEK
My understanding is that this is a first step, and I look forward to interviewing White House Counsel McGahn, COS Kelly, FBI Director Wray, and others to determine what they knew and when they knew it, which Gowdy said he wanted to do during a press interview this morning.
I spoke personally with Chairman Gowdy this morning about the document requests the Committee is sending to the White House and the FBI, which are due in two weeks.

@iteptweets According to the IRS, 46% of households in MD claim the SALT deduction‚Äîthe largest share of any state in the country.
@iteptweets Additionally, MD is one of the states hit hardest by the new tax law, due in large part to the new $10K limit on the SALT deduction.
According to @iteptweets, over 360,000 MD households will get a tax increase under the new tax law in 2019.

No wonder a @QuinnipiacPoll found that American voters reject the #GOPTaxScam 2 to 1, with only 25% approving and 52% disapproving.
(3) This is all while the #GOPTaxScam explodes the national debt by at least $1.8 trillion. The GOP will use this as a pretext to slash key programs that middle class families rely on, like Medicare and Social Security.
(2) The meager, temporary benefits for the middle class under the #GOPTaxScam evaporate after a few years and the scam ultimately raises taxes on 86 million middle class families.
And here are a few other things we know about the #GOPTaxScam: (1) 83% of the tax cuts to the wealthiest 1%.
This means that the #GOPTaxScam‚Äôs permanent $1.3 trillion tax cut for corporations won‚Äôt actually create jobs for Americans like Republicans promised.

@LEpartnership 17 State AGs coast to coast, from Maryland to Oregon, oppose #HR38 because it would override local public safety decisions and endanger our communities and law enforcement officers. #OpposeCCR https://t.co/CwxRvZk5Mx
.@LEpartnership represents 900,000 law enforcement officers and staff. They oppose #HR38 because it severely undermines successful, well-established state laws governing carrying concealed firearms. #OpposeCCR https://t.co/kjXOvnUj2N
Did you know that there are twelve states that do not require a permit to carry concealed? #HR38 says they‚Äôll be able to carry in our state, too. #OpposeCCR
I oppose #HR38 because concealed carry reciprocity is dangerous for Maryland and for our country. It would damage state and local governments‚Äô ability to craft gun laws appropriate to their needs. #OpposeCCR
The House is slated to vote on #HR38 - the Concealed Carry Reciprocity bill. This legislation allows someone without a permit to carry a gun in our state. #OpposeCCR
Nearly 30 exhibitors are here which include representatives from community and state colleges, public and private universities and scholarship organizations.
Be sure and stop by Maryland Institute College of Art Brown Center where the 2017 How to Pay for College seminar will be happening until 8pm. There you can learn more about higher education and financial aid programs available to you!

@SenSanders @doj @FTC #POTUS picking former drug exec  to lead HHS is like a fox guarding the hen house. This is a slap in the face to millions of Americans who are waiting on POTUS to take action to lower drug prices.

#POTUS promised to ‚Äúdrain the swamp‚Äù and ‚Äúlower drug prices‚Äù but he hasn‚Äôt taken any action. Instead, he is nominating Azar, the CEO at #EliLilly, which raised drug prices by double digits under his watch.

We must fight against this with all we've got, because there's too much at stake for us not to.
@KrisKobach1787 Last year, a federal court said that the state's voter suppression law targeted minority voters with "almost surgical precision."
@KrisKobach1787 In North Carolina, the GOP state legislature began working on voter suppression legislation the day after #SCOTUS' decision.
@KrisKobach1787 Since the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013, many statehouses have passed legislation to suppress the vote.
@KrisKobach1787 I have said many times in recent months that this is not about President Trump, it is a fight for the soul of our democracy.
#POTUS has empowered @KrisKobach1787, an extremist who has restricted the vote in Kansas, to take his destructive policies nationwide.
In fact, I hand-delivered a letter to #POTUS urging him to investigate #VoterSuppression: https://t.co/9BqHBGt0gP

If @POTUS sees things that will affect generations yet unborn, I hope he speaks out against it when he leaves office.
But after 7 years of urging repeal, Republicans still have not presented an alternative to insure the American people.
We all know that there are things we can do to improve the ACA, and I am ready to work with republicans to do that.
I have complete confidence in our Intelligence Community's assessment that Russia interfered in our election.
We need an equal # of Ds and Rs on a truly independent commission to investigate these attacks.

Police departments need better recruitment, and training on deescalation and implicit biases.
We need to accept that young Black Americans have many legitimate grievances.

Instead, we must continue to love each other and cherish the shared values that make us Americans.
We must not, and we cannot, let fear win because these attacks are intended to tear us apart as a nation.
In the wake of yet another tragedy enabled by guns, we must come together to prevent dangerous people from getting dangerous weapons.
The shooting in Orlando was senseless and tragic. My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their loved ones.

He represented the best of what makes us Americans‚Äîcourage, confidence, grace and humility. #RIPMuhammadAli
Ali stood on his principles when many people in our country were telling him not to, and for that display of courage, we are all grateful.
As a child, I was inspired by the way he moved in the ring, but the man he was outside the ring has inspired me even more. #RIPMuhammadAli

African Americans and other people of color are taxpayers &amp; deserve to have robust representation at state universities that they help fund.
Scalia‚Äôs reasoning is not only illogical, it is dangerous, shortsighted and detrimental for our increasingly diverse nation.
If you carry Scalia‚Äôs argument to its logical conclusion, then White students should also be stereotyped tracked en mass to a ‚Äòslower track.
His argument begs the question about the many White students who struggle academically at the University of Texas.
His argument ignores the fact that many students of color perform well at, and graduate from, the University of Texas every year.
Scalia‚Äôs remarks are a disgraceful contemporary example of views that were typical of segregationists in pre-Civil Rights era America.
