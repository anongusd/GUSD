When people without hesitance give away a movie tickets worth money towards the armed forces n their families each month! the least we can do to support the people who are our "real heroes" not reel. The magic of movies is amazing. Bt the jazz around people involved unnecessary.
When the army is glorified and covered as much as Bollywood. When airport looks and OFTD feature army looks nd uniforms. When 100crores success parties are replaced by rescue operation success parties.We need 2 make a conscious effort to rid ourselves from this dilution.

.@tedlieu can we request your support to @SaveH4EADs ?? We are a group of thousands of women who are at the cusp of losing our work auth since @DHSgov wants to rescind it. We are skilled talented and educted women requesting the chance at being independent.
@AltTrol @spmishra @aparnapkin @DHSgov @SaveH4EADs Thank you for wanting to know more genuinely. It's a wrong assumption that the spouses are not highly skilled. As per our survey 55% of the spouses have a Master's and about 95% a bachelor's.Not all jobs get h1b sponsors.does not mean they aren't skilled:-(
@animalologist @AltTrol @spmishra @aparnapkin @DHSgov @SaveH4EADs H4s can't work coz their visas don't let them until the spouse has a GC applied. Going by the indian culture, well educated people often marry equally or fairly well educated spouses be it either gender.
@AltTrol @spmishra @aparnapkin @DHSgov @SaveH4EADs That's a myth that most of them are well off. It scary to depend on one earning with the uncertainties in life.
@AltTrol @spmishra @aparnapkin @DHSgov @SaveH4EADs My husband has a Master's from the US on an H1b. Been in US for a decade now.i have an MBA but won't qualify for h1b as it's not in STEM. Am I less qualified to not be able to work?not letting women work negatively impacts the society too.
@AltTrol @spmishra @aparnapkin @DHSgov @SaveH4EADs These folks wld have had GCs by now if not for the backlog. There are diff nationalities, though nothing against them who don't necessarily need to prove their skills to get a GC.V are yet stuck. It's not about the income. It's about being dependent.
