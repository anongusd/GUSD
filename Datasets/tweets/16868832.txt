@BWildeGlobal We have good D-men in the pipeline. Lets find a couple of goal scorers.
@BWildeGlobal Wonder how Edmonton pulled that off, especially considering all of Columbus' talent.  And a shutout no less. That's the great thing about hockey.  So let's enjoy the Canadiens game tonight!
@OversightDems @RepCummings I knew Adam Schiff was going to go after Trump but Elijah Cummings has his broadsword out.  Looks like he's commanding the cavalry.  Elijah Cummings is BADASS!!!!!

@MotherJones Need some serious righteous indignation here. That's downright insulting.
@iTheDeadPixel He could be helpful on RW. Also be another face off guy. We need better face offs in d-zone.
The GOP needs to look for A Tom Railsback in their ranks. That was a man of courage and conviction who paved the way for others to question a president of his own party. An unsung hero of Watergate. He did his duty with honor.
@AbsCoverage No doubt but he needs to pick his spots better and not try to do too much. That's when he gets in trouble.
@StormyDaniels That's showing serious class Stormy. A wonderful statement.
@4everNeverTrump @ddale8 That's really saying a lot especially with Meadows, Jordan and Virginia. Foxx on the same committee.

@thehockeyexpert @ja_ghost @MOBeaudoin1 Appreciate that you understand my caution. I'm that way because quality RD are hard to come by and that is a real strength of ours. I think that if we don't draft a LD early, Timmons make come up with one of his gems.
@thehockeyexpert @ja_ghost @MOBeaudoin1 I would want to be sure that Brook or any other D is NHL ready and has shown it before I would trade Petry. And we have Romanov coming up to take the LD spot. Could get a high quality scorer for him.
@Rontzeeez Very much.
@MOBeaudoin1 Well it's good that they have made a full commitment to player development. A year in Laval won't hurt.
@Rontzeeez And he can play both sides! Real star in the making. Another Erik Karlsson maybe?
@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump Get him Brian!!!!
@Rontzeeez Another Trevor Timmons draft day steal.
@stucam7771 No actually I feel more threatened than ever and not from immigrants.
@MOBeaudoin1 Wouldn't hurt to have him spend a year with Joel Bouchard.

@fnveenie My first time in 2 years also.
@SafetyNhlParros I saw those Edmonton teams in the 80's. They were fast and fun to watch. They looked like jet fighters in formation entering the zone. Never saw defencemen go back so fast. But the way they moved the puck was awesome.
@SafetyNhlParros And knew how to go get it.  It wasn't just the stats, he did a lot of the little things. He was a hard worker.
@SafetyNhlParros Have to agree. Stats don't lie but that only tells part of the story. He was a passionate guy. There is a documentary about the Oilers of that era that had him talking to teammates that showed his leadership.
@samstein More like 293.
@fnveenie Well it's in Anaheim. And with the price of tickets nowadays. I paid $71.00 a seat for these and that's a bargain. Most seats are over 120.00 and up to 300-400 bucks. And that's for a lousy Anaheim team.
@BWildeGlobal The amazing thing is that as a Canadian, you have a better insight into this than most U.S. citizens.
@fnveenie I agree. Although I'm pumped because I got tickets for Canadiens at Anaheim March 8th.

@ASlavitt We figured that out a while ago.
@AbsCoverage That's never a good idea. Bergevin knew he dug himself into a hole but figured out in a hurry how to get out of it. It wasn't just personnel but also the atmosphere in the locker room. He's really put his stamp on this team now and in the future.
