@HillyHindi BOOYAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@ERodBuster1 I never noticed that.
@ERodBuster1 I'm so excited for this crossover!!!!!!!!!!
@HillyHindi Well, it's a good thing I don't have a Netflix account anymore because if I did, I would have the same reaction as you, Hilly.
@HillyHindi I don't think you're old. Also, how would asking for an electric kettle for Christmas is a sign that you're old?
@HillyHindi Well, it's a good thing I ordered it when I did. Oh, and that means I'll be getting the Happy Hillydays card. Booyah!!!!!!!!!!!!!

@ERodBuster1 I'm so excited for this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@HillyHindi I could watch that GIF all day and never get tired of it. Also, Hilly is my spirit animal.
@HannahHindi I am!!!!!!!!!
@HillyHindi Can't wait to see what it is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@HillyHindi My heart is saying yes, but my bank account is saying no.
@HannahHindi I'm screaming internally!!!!!!!
@HillyHindi @HillywoodShow Wow. That's definitely a very random photo from the first Supernatural Parody.
@HillyHindi Well, as Hannah Montana once sang, Nobody's Perfect.
@HillyHindi I'll definitely be tuning in to watch it!!
@HillywoodShow Yes, yes, a million times yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@HillyHindi I want to know how to make those.
@HillyHindi So happy I don't have to deal with that.
@thisgoodshit Mean Girls. The first time I watched it was when I was in high school in a psychology class I took.
@HillywoodShow @HillyHindi @HannahHindi Happy Thanksgiving Hannah and Hilly!!!!!
@HillyHindi Now I wished I watched her performance. I bet it was good.
@HillyHindi I totally missed that.
Happy Thanksgiving!!!!!
@HillyHindi I also wish I was a part of the film industry, mainly as a writer/director. I think I would be good at those.
@HillyHindi 99 cent store to the rescue!!!!!
@HillyHindi üòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑ Wow. That is one funny GIF. Hope you have a good Thanksgiving tomorrow, Hilly.

@HillyHindi Well, as long as you're cozy and comfortable, then who cares if you don't look sexy?

I saw Bohemian Rhapsody with my Mom today. It was a very good film and I highly recommend it to those of you who have never listened to Queen or if you want to know more about the history of the band.
@HillyHindi Well, it's about time Hillywood was on YouTubers react!!!!! Can't wait to see it.
@MST3K I first discovered MST3K when some of the old episodes became available on Netflix before season 11 premiered. The first one I watched was Manos: The Hands of Fate, and I've been hooked ever since. #MST3KTurkeyDay

@HillyHindi Hope you're okay. Sending you a virtual hug.
