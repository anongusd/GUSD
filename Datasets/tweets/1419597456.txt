@FRSandro @brithume Well, admitting to dancing around in blackface makes that photo seem more legitimate.		And you'd think, a friend in school would notice that and say "Hey Ralph, what's this about?"
@brithume If it is confirmed he was not in that photo, I'll retract my statement.		However, if it was not him, why was it on his page? Why did it take 35 years to release a statement about it - just do it immediately? Why did you say yesterday it was you but now it's not? So many more Qs.
@AP If it is confirmed he was not in that photo, I'll retract my statement.		However, if it was not him, why was it on his page? Why did it take 35 years to release a statement about it - just do it immediately? Why did you say yesterday it was you but now it's not? So many more Qs.
@SamualTunisia @washingtonpost The act Northam did was a rascist act. Did he mean it as too be racist, more than likely not. But right now, that stains VA Gov's office till he either resigns or gets voted out.		Just like Steve King from IA. He's an idiot, but I don't believe he's a white supremacist either.
@SamualTunisia @washingtonpost As I stated, standing in front of a flag isn't racist. It's just that a photo in front of a flag. I've heard Democrats say the American Flag is totally racist. I suppose all the Dems and Reps should be held responsible for standing in front that 🇺🇸 too? No. It's ridiculous.
@SamualTunisia @washingtonpost That is nothing compared to being either dressed in KKK outfit or in blackface, which are purely racist acts. Standing in front of a flag to take a picture isn't racist. Taking a photo dressed in hatred is hate.
Who is going to win the #SuperBowl
@washingtonpost Just yesterday, he admitted it was him. Democrats love rascism so much they founded the KKK.

@Wearetheleavers @debriley1997 Have you ever looked into what it believes? I have and scientists believe life formed in a oceanic "soup" called primordial soup or prebiotic soup, where chemicals formed into a blob, which over millions of yrs finally grew legs and started walking on the beach.
@debriley1997 @Wearetheleavers You'd be more likelier to get him to say an alien laid an egg that made humans. I mean atheism literally believes dirt made life in oceanic "soup" 4.5 billion years ago.
@debriley1997 @Wearetheleavers No point in responding. All he'll do is say it's not a quote or say God is fake. You can't debate this because no matter what you say or do it's false or fake.
@Wearetheleavers @DrunkAllah I have repeatedly showed you, and you refuse to acknowledge the quote is clearly written in black in the Bible.

@ABC ABC article was written after the announcement. There should not be this kind of mistake! What's even sadder is the fact Marvel and ABC are part of the same company..
@SamualTunisia @ABC I have to disagree. Our high school food used to be great or at least much better. Before I graduated, the food was absolutely terrible.
@MarvelStudios If I see another old lady get slapped, I'm slapping everyone at Marvel.
I bet you they go for the head this time. #AvengersEndgame

@OneSixtyToOne @ABC I had a salad bar in HS before the Mitchelle Obama's plan went mainstream! Our food literally turned to crap afterwards.
@ABC THANK GOD. I've never tasted anything worse in my life than my high-school food. Even the milk tasted like cigarette ashes.		Maybe children will actually have edible food.

Have a great night, @SamualTunisia. Sleep well.
@SamualTunisia @TheDemocrats It literally would be against the constitution to take away guns. The 2nd Amendment was a gun issue. As the 14th Amendment was a slave issue.
@tndp I was never asked? I don't support these things.
@SamualTunisia @TheDemocrats Thomas Jefferson wrote it in a letter, but the wordings are not in the constitution anywhere. That's where I stand.
RT @DetPikachuMovie: Partner up with a legend. @VancityReynolds is #DetectivePikachu in theaters Summer 2019! https://t.co/QyX0TyUP74
@SamualTunisia @TheDemocrats You specifically stated "Separation of church and state." That line is not in the constitution anywhere. The First Amendment deals with a free nation to exercise any religion he or she may desire with no state religion.
@SamualTunisia @TheDemocrats 1. More and more gun control is an attack on the 2nd Amendment. 		2. No where in US Constitution does it state that. One prime example was the IRS was targeting Christian organizations under the former President.
@SamualTunisia @TheDemocrats I clearly stated that is was "not just the President but others as well" being responsible for this.
@SamualTunisia @TheDemocrats Not necessarily a hurt on us, but some were problematic on our values. (And yes there's value problems with Prez Trump)		One for ex: It felt that the 2nd Amendment was being infringed upon.		Felt less support for Israel and Christians.
@SamualTunisia @TheDemocrats I don't know about you, but I'm super glad that I got a new senator and new governor in the midterms. I like my incumbent congressman, so voted for him. He's a great man, and have sponsored / set forth and passed many great bills.
@SamualTunisia @TheDemocrats We felt forgotten by the politicians in office. Our voices seemed to not be heard. Now, we feel as if someone is in office that works for us, not just the President but others as well. 		We think for ourselves. There's no political meeting to decide who we are voting for.
@SamualTunisia @TheDemocrats Our lives did get worse:		1. The biggest of all: Healthcare was awful. Too expensive and less coverage. Couldn't afford it, then got taxed because we couldn't purchase it.	2. Less jobs.	3. Etc.
@SamualTunisia @TheDemocrats Any tax cut - no mater how small or big - benefits the rich. Why? They pay the most taxes! And speaking of taxes, my family has enjoyed the tax cuts from the current Administration. They've kept more of their check each week.
@SamualTunisia @TheDemocrats Donald Trump is the outsider. We trusted him because we felt forgotten. My family voted for Obama - twice - and switched parties for Trump when our lives didn't get better, and in a lot of cases, worse off.
@SamualTunisia @TheDemocrats That's not the point here. Celebrities are literally in 1% which Democrats have consistently hated on. 		Celebrities don't understand the hardships the average American faces. I agree with Mark Walberg: "celebrities...shouldn’t [talk about politics]." "They’re...out of touch."
@SamualTunisia @shannoneffects1 Politics is a blood sport, and all parties are responsible. 		Republicans hate Democrats.	Democrats hate Republicans.	Everyone hates Libertarians.

@SamualTunisia @RedNationRising @PressSec The White House never said assault had occurred. 		Saying Pres Sec intentionally uploaded an altered video is also unrealistic. Both videos show that Jim Acosta doing the same thing. One may be a hair faster, but it doesn't change the fact of what happened.
@SamualTunisia @RedNationRising @PressSec There are some minor changes, likely from the frame rate. This shows that. 		But like I said, the best way to end this whole debate, is to get the woman's opinion. 	 https://t.co/nvEo0hVE5w
@SamualTunisia @RedNationRising That video is different than the @PressSec vid. 		Regardless, The best way to solve this is asking the woman herself. Ppl are quick to throw hammers but slow to real journalism. Asking the girl can end this whole dispute.
@SamualTunisia @RedNationRising Zooming in on a video will cause some frame rate issues. I know this first, as I had to do some changes on one I had. 		But the original and zoomed in (edited one - whatever one may call it) is showing consistent image.
@SamualTunisia @RedNationRising @Acosta sayin he did touch her is a lie. You can clearly see his hand on hers. What @RedNationRising is just saying, we have more logical evidence of assault than with Kavanaugh. No reasonable person would claim Jim Acosta assaulted her. https://t.co/egY1LpvCDK
@SamualTunisia @RedNationRising This clearly shows video is 99.99% the same as the original. Claiming it is not the same is simply not rational thinking. There is no evidence proving the video has been altered, other than possible frame rates from zooming in. https://t.co/UGclen7HJB

@NicoMorin2 Well, thank you for the kind responses and civil discussion. I'm needed to get some sleep, as I have to be up in the morning. Goodnight.
@NicoMorin2 It doesn't just happen on one side. We elect people to not hear a word from them until election year is upon us. That's not have the founding fathers invisioned it. In fact, I agree with George Washington when he said political parties would split the nation; They have.
@NicoMorin2 Congrats on the surgery. The bill did help many ppl. It just caused raising premiums and less options after we were told that this would not happen. AHCA needed to be better before a vote. There were supposed to be stages on it. Should have just been connected as one plan.
@BoomaSoona84 @mitchellvii Yes, but don't think the Democrats couldn't win. That's the worst thing Republicans can do going into Tuesday.
@NicoMorin2 I think it could go hand and hand if implemented correctly. But, it would likely be a better move to just keep the departments separated.		Betsy Devos isn't the best pick to lead the DoE. As a free thinker, I don't support all that she has said/done, but that's politics
@NicoMorin2 We the people should be the ones to keep check on the government. 2/2
@NicoMorin2 This is a logical statement. However, ppl voting for a party to control all forms of government (Governors, House, Senate, President, and Supreme Court) is their right. We need to vote for ppl who will help accomp what a President has promised to us, regardless who they are. 1/2
@NicoMorin2 Republican plan released was better, and thanks to John McCain (sarcasm) it was not repealed and replace. Their plan was not perfect by any means but was much better than what we have now. Thank God for the repeal of the tax on those not having health insurance. 2/2
@NicoMorin2 My family's healthcare plummeted after ObamaCare was signed into law. Majority of my region began getting terrible and expensive health insurance. When my father couldn't afford it because it was too expensive, he had to pay fine. ObamaCare was a disaster. 1/2
@NicoMorin2 Common Core, which Democrats support, has failed our school systems. I graduated HS 2 years ago and I can 100% say it needs to be redone because it does no good. Betsy Devos has lots of work to do, but at least she understands how awful CC is.
@NicoMorin2 There is literally nothing that could get me to vote Blue, not the way Democrats have disrepected out President and Republican congressman. If you want my vote, give a reason instead of hate!
@TalbertSwan @staceyabrams She isn't qualified! She's way too socialistic and so is Gillum! We need candidates like John James!

@MoniqueWorthy @GOP Agreed! But, I would encourage you to believe the polls and vote like your life depended on it. Staying home is not the answer. Majority of these polls have much higher percentages of Dem voters than Reps, just like the newly released ABC one: 33% Democrat to 27% Republican.

@CollinsNicole07 @VoteMarsha I do not have any info to the reason why they were asked to leave and neither do you. Saying otherwise is not fact but a simple opinion you've conjured up.
@CollinsNicole07 @VoteMarsha The man clearly showed another black man in there. Therefore, you're comment is irrational and not well thought out.
@CollinsNicole07 @VoteMarsha Without proper knowledge of what occurred, this video shows no wrongdoing. No one touched, no one hurt, no one yelling. All I heard was the man asking them to kindly leave, in which they did not. All the facts of this has not been shown.

@storiesandpages @narimanian Watch your language. God's name is not to be taken in vain.
@StevePecht Tell me where I posted "Democratic mob" anywhere on any of my profiles?		What about Steve Scalise shooter, who was a strong Bernie supporter, or the man who beat Rand Paul, braking his ribs? Have you forgot about those congressmen?
@zapemded @ShangoriGannos @narimanian I said "supportive," not communism, which is true. I did not say they want communism, but instead they want socialism, a branch of communistic beliefs. Aka Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren
@zapemded @ShangoriGannos @narimanian Funny that you mention communists. Democrats are supportive of communism.
@SecretGoverning I agree.

Cesar Sayoc was apparently on radar for bomb threats years before Pres Donald J. Trump, so having a fuss about this mentally ill domestic terrorist but not those that have attacked Republicans is pathetic. All forms of political violence should be condemned.
@martyr021 @CBSNews Thank you! The only thing I heard from Pres Trump was that they were working on another tax cut, but never said an exact time frame to be officially announced.
@martyr021 @CBSNews I must not be getting your comment. Can you clarify this: "It is. He did later clarify that would be after."
@martyr021 @CBSNews Are you saying Obama clarified?
@CBSNews He did not say that.
@CassandraRules Only one side beat up a congressmen, breaking his ribs.
@AliasMaxwell @Goss30Goss They do not care. This exact picture has been posted before.
@AliasMaxwell @Goss30Goss Because I don't care. If you are that insane to search my family and make threats, I'll call the cops.
@deerhyde I was not there. Therefore, I can not say with complete certainty that he put them there.		But what I can say is that he was making bomb threats before (one from 2002) and has been on terror watch.

@ReaderGalore @MyRadarWX I think I've used it before. Since RadarScope has the most powerful radars, from reflectivity to rainfall totals, it's all around a better platform. For as weather forecasts, it does not offer that, but it's not the goal of the app.

@ReaderGalore The one downside (which doesn't concern me) is RadarScope costs $10 on Android and iOS. For Windows 10 and MAC OS, it's $30.		I have the pro version which is an extra $10 a yr. Pro tier 2 is $100 a yr.

@tango2me2 @ElectBergmann @RealAustinBall @realDonaldTrump I've worked for what I've got. And I'm proud of what I got. I don't think we should complain that somebody else has something that we don't. I'm not going to pity myself because I ain't got no rich car, a big beautiful house, or the fanciest clothes. All I want is a loving 👪.
@tango2me2 @ElectBergmann @RealAustinBall @realDonaldTrump I don't care that a company makes 40 million dollars more because of tax cuts. Do I think it's fair? Yes, I do. I do not believe in socialism that every man deserves as much money as the other man does. If you've got Jesus and God, you have everything you need.
@tango2me2 @ElectBergmann @RealAustinBall @realDonaldTrump My uncle loves that extra $1040 a year. My family grew up in a very poor family. They cherished what they had and we still do. That extra money goes a long way in our family. It can fill up the car, it does help pay for the bills, and etc.

@tango2me2 @ElectBergmann @RealAustinBall @realDonaldTrump It was not a lie. Cohen paid for it as he has claimed. Because Micheal Cohen is his lawyer, Donald Trump repayed any funds that Cohen uses through a retainer. So Donald Trump is technically correct in his statements. &amp;  he would not have known every single payment his lawyer made
@tango2me2 @ElectBergmann @RealAustinBall @realDonaldTrump It was Trump's fault that our health insurance got worse and extremely expensive in 2012? OK. Because obviously Donald J. Trump was president then.
@mitchellvii @gatewaypundit https://t.co/J6tRBNIZHh
@tango2me2 @ElectBergmann @RealAustinBall @realDonaldTrump 5: Just like these:		"If you like your plan, you can keep your plan." Wrong.	"If you like your doctor, you can keep your plan." Wrong.

@tango2me2 @ElectBergmann @RealAustinBall @realDonaldTrump No evidence has proved Brett Kavanugh sexually anyone. 		President Donald J. Trump has accusations, none have been proven.
@tango2me2 @ElectBergmann @RealAustinBall @realDonaldTrump Everyone has a right to peaceful protest. Democrats have not been peaceful on many occasions. I can show you video evidence of Dems hitting Reps, throwing drinks in Reps' faces, jump on top of cop cars, and so much more.		Democrats doesn't break the laws? Pshhhht
@tango2me2 @ElectBergmann @RealAustinBall @realDonaldTrump 4: I can easily think for myself and see that Democrats hated due process with Brett Kavanaugh.		What about the Democrats hiring them for their rallies and protests? Prez Trump's economy is for everyone.		Who said that ppl didn't have a right to protest? NO ONE. 1ST AMENDMENT
@tango2me2 @ElectBergmann @RealAustinBall @realDonaldTrump 3: No it was not. My grandmother's health insurance rose. My father couldn't afford it because it was too expensive and got fined for not being able to afford it! 		Rep Plan? Ask McCain, he screwed you over for not voting in favor of a better plan.

@iMakeArtifacts @Ethanhunt233231 @andIwillpersist @thehill @TeaPainUSA Either Dr. Ford's lying about who she gave it too or Diane Feinstein / someone in her office who had access to the letter leaked it to the press. There's no other explanation.
@Bugman83 @andIwillpersist @thehill @TeaPainUSA He was angry of the total nonsense Democrats had been playing this entire ordeal. It was awful. I'd be going after them too.
@VoteMarsha I wished I was there!!!!
@Ethanhunt233231 @iMakeArtifacts @andIwillpersist @thehill @TeaPainUSA You are accused of murder.		The accuser says 4 ppl were present. 	They've all denied it.		The accuser says she is "100" percent sure it was you, but she can't remember where or when it occurred. She doesn't even know how she got there or left. 		See how that sounds? Irrational.
@iMakeArtifacts @Ethanhunt233231 @andIwillpersist @thehill @TeaPainUSA Leland said she has never met Brett Kavanaugh or been at a party with him in presence of Dr. Ford or without. 		That's a clear denial.

@iMakeArtifacts @andIwillpersist @thehill @TeaPainUSA She set forth the facts and gave an educated assessment of what she knows as a prosecutor. Suggesting she was "biased" is ridiculous. The facts prove Dr. Ford's testimony was not credible and was many inconsistencies with her statements.

@TN_WX It's interesting to say the least.
@TN_WX I'll likely release it later in the morning. It is damaging, but as a reporter for https://t.co/0ucNsKwl3b, I must be unbiased and allow the public to hear.
@TN_WX I've tested it and gave a thorough dissection. It's near indisputable.
@TN_WX, this source's audio tape is going to blow your mind. I couldn't believe what I heard tbh.
My source, who was close to the two during a party, was recording a video that picked up Brett and Dr. Ford talking. The video I have is part of that audio. More info to come. https://t.co/QuzzHq9MlQ
Through a anonymous source, I have recieved an audio tape of Brett Kavanaugh with Dr. Christine Ford, saying "I'll behave" if she would model for him. Stay Tuned!

@milioffuk @thehill I can say exactly the same thing for Democrats.
@Nate_Cohn Why would you be polling to support the Republican but would have the Democrats win the House? That simply does not make sense to me.
@thehill Yet, if you take a look at the live polling by @Nate_Cohn, Brett Kavanaugh has continued to win among support?
@thehill One poll Cruz is winning by 9 points.		Another poll Beto is winning by 2 points. 		There is no logical way that there was a 11 point swing in less than 24 hours. In fact, the polling would be nearly taken on the same days...		This is exactly why you cannot believe the polls.
@genetyson @thehill Absolutely no one. 		One poll Cruz is winning by 9 points.		Another poll Beto is winning by 2 points. 		There is no logical way that there was a 11 point swing in less than 24 hours. In fact, the polling would be nearly taken on the same days...

@VICE Says her therapist is wrong about her notes. Nothing is adding up. If she refuses to come to the hearing Monday, after saying she would testify last than 24 hrs earlier, the Senate should move ahead to vote to confirm Kavanaugh that afternoon after Brett's testimony. 2/2
@VICE Could it be because there's nothing to investigate.. No evidence. The "witness" she named said he doesn't recall any misbehavior or disrepect of Brett to any woman. Another person also said he / she never saw anything. She doesn't remember anything. 1/2

@BullMooseFuture @brithume Not exactly. Her therapist claims Ford told her 4 ppl in the room, according to her notes. Now, she says only 2. She said she would be willing to testify: 24 hrs later, she changed her mind. It's just something new that puts a hole into her account everyday.
@brithume The very passing of minute in this case the more skeptical I become. Nothing adds up. So many differences in accounts, can not remember anything, supposed witnesses deny Dr. Ford's accounts. The Senate should move forward to vote.

@latuka316 My point is he was being sympathetic and only going off one photo can be misleading facts.		That being said, Trump should have been rallying supporters somehere else. But to equate this one picture to not showing empathy is just not an accurate description of the total event.
@latuka316 It was either NYT, MSNBC, or Vox person tweet about 30 minutes ago said that this only occurred when he walked up. After that, he was being sympathetic.

@latuka316 I want to clarify my statement some.		If Brett Kavanaugh had clearly said in an email he was there, Kavanaugh's statement could be misleading. But that is not what we have. It's just a invitation.

@latuka316 I would need more information on this to give a thorough assessment. However, Kavanough isn't wrong to say he "was not involved." based on that. An email doesn't prove anything here. Unless there's proof he was there, his statement can't be proven wrong based on that email.
