@riotsquirl @Tahatsataha @bellesapepper37 @Freeyourmindkid @AtheistWoman99 I appreciate the mass block, which generally screens out whole swaths.
@bellesapepper37 @Tahatsataha @riotsquirl @Freeyourmindkid @AtheistWoman99 The reality is that one can be single or married, and still quite stupid and willfully ignorant looking for a digital riot. Your character is what it is, in any situation.
@F1lthee1 @2deep4someBlkPl I just read blah blah, blah blah. Just because I commented on this, doesn't mean you get to show up and act stupid, confused that I won't join you. Appreciate that I had no bias to respond to you, but respect that you need to level up or go away from me.
@F1lthee1 @2deep4someBlkPl My main defense is my character a person encounters when they first meet me so acting like that towards me seems the worst option to even consider. If you are in a relationship with someone and fear they will emasculate you with an argument - leave them, and go build up yourself.
@F1lthee1 @2deep4someBlkPl What I see is that you think you are talking to someone on the level you typical talk on, so you think I'm "missing" the point because I'm not giving you the standard stupid responses you expect that will have us grunting and spitting in BM vs. BW war terms. Sorry, not the one.
@F1lthee1 @2deep4someBlkPl No. Emasculating is often used as belittling but you wouldn't say a woman was emasculated right? Because you sense the actual definition of the word. I said nobody should be belittled like that, and that emasculating isn't the risk here.
@F1lthee1 @2deep4someBlkPl "women and their" - let's keep in mind that everyone doesn't act like either side of what is being discussed. These aren't default qualities for men and women. Trust that if you aren't like that, you can step away from people like that, rather than form a character to pair off.
@F1lthee1 @2deep4someBlkPl The tweet fit the same level mentality that woman showed, she's on display showing what she won't take, and so a man has to fear the world seeing him emasculated? The rational thing isn't to fear loss of your masculinity, but to show basic sense and get away from that ignorance.
@F1lthee1 @2deep4someBlkPl That tweet urged men to avoid emasculation, as if being treated badly - I guess by a woman - meant they weren't as "masculine." That is an unnecessary ego slur meant to evoke a reaction from fragile men when rationally nobody should take that treatment from anyone male or female.
@F1lthee1 @2deep4someBlkPl Men afraid of being "belittled" start to exaggerate every tiny, ridiculously unimportant action as belittlement that they have to stomp out vigorously for fear of manhood. It creates an emotional panic of penis loss and public respect in situations they can simply end entirely.
@F1lthee1 @2deep4someBlkPl Of course someone can belittle you, but that doesn't mean they take your masculinity unless you think masculinity is no pain, flaw, weak spot, insecurity, fear. And thinking that way creates a pattern of behavior that is a weakness in itself. Strength is resilience not rigidity.
@noelcamille @JessicaGoldstei That's a whole other long conversation to have, the corporate inanity &amp; security vs. freelance sanity &amp; stress. The personality test was to best fit me in a pegboard and encourage me to climb up, but it just reminded me to avoid the pegboard.

@noelcamille @JessicaGoldstei My friend grew up in Japan and we talked a lot about the naming of places, and the cultural legacy that guided building in places. The "forbidden" places and the "dangerous" places - even just reverence for how one builds - are lost in colonized societies where legacy is severed.
@noelcamille @JessicaGoldstei Just what Jessica's tweet about the creek road made me first think about - we don't commonly know what exists below us and are unprepared for the path of water. Superstorm Sandy moved right up and along the original island boundaries.

@Freeyourmindkid She has branded herself with firm ideas refuting the mainstream thinking on religion (atheist!) - but in just a few minutes of tweeting apparently you took her from totally not racist at all, to seeing the reasonableness on the side of racism. Suddenly, out comes her 'new' ideas.

@noelcamille @JessicaGoldstei Yes, this is one of my favorite nerd topics, so I've read a lot about Chicago too. Humans have always built cities on top of cities, but in America we forget that our cities are built on top of cities as well, older American communities, esp. about those that predate America.
@JessicaGoldstei Lower Manhattan is creepy. With the African grave yard, the yet to be found graves, the sea reaching for the original borders of the island, and just what history and grisly secrets have been buried under that land, it is both horror and disaster movie waiting to happen.

@DysonDoll And by bake a lot I mean "have baked often" - because refuse to turn every day into a giant food day, esp. with pies, cookies, cakes, etc. added in. Fortunately, I actually do grow a lot of vegetables, herbs, so that is the primary focus of my cooking and eating.

@DysonDoll We shall not be discouraged. You can make this right. I know you can.
@DysonDoll https://t.co/ajy9Oqdxb4
@DysonDoll Let me try this: ever had peach cobbler with ice cream?
@JessicaGoldstei There are rivers bricked up under main streets in Manhattan. Land created by dumping construction rubble, old ships/building materials, and that island was originally much smaller (not just greener/tree covered) than it is now. Only some names mark that legacy, most erase it.
@DysonDoll Here I am mourning my lack of ice cream for this moment of apple pie eating, flaunting my privilege by not considering people who never had ice cream on their apple pie. I feel ashamed, yet full of apple pie, so I'm just so torn. (yet so full of pie)
@DysonDoll Ok, let's be calm during this emergency. This is what you have to do. Get apple pie. Get some vanilla bean or similar ice cream. Heat the apple pie to a warm or near hot temperature. You want a slower melt when you put the ice cream on top of the apple pie. Eat and enjoy life.

@Tammytheescort @be_praised @iamAtheistGirl Nothing is more lazy and casual about racism than merging a lot of confused bits of history into a justification for your own racism. You insulted a whole range of people who read books, learn history, aren't racist, challenge their own minds, fix their own ignorance, etc.
@Tammytheescort @be_praised @iamAtheistGirl You should escort yourself to a library or a bookstore or some authentic historical websites, but I guess your fear is that actual history and reasoned analysis may be too hard for you and would force you to realize how racist and stupid you are. You don't want to change that.
@Tammytheescort @be_praised @iamAtheistGirl You showed a lot of historical stupid, that wouldn't exist if you cared to actually learn history. But you don't care about learning actual history, you just want your racism to sound smart and factual. It isn't. You aren't. You care about defending your racism, only.
@Tammytheescort @be_praised @iamAtheistGirl You claim I have no concern about it because I pointed out your ignorance on a whole range of history simply because you want to minimize the span and impact of slavery in the U.S. - ignorance you wouldn't have if you cared at all about contemporary slavery.
@JessicaGoldstei In Manhattan "Wall Street" is near "Water Street" which explains why there was a wall, and further details how everything below there was a later construction not existing land, and why it floods heavily during a storm. Much of Manhattan is expanded on rubble and water reclaims.
@JessicaGoldstei It is interesting how land was named to reflect traits that were important to know, then subsequent changes to names, restructuring for "status purchase" left out such details, and people don't know the propensity/basic state of the land they are on. Creek = where's the water
This is why it is important for black people to know history and never fall for this racist mishmash of flawed "facts" that only serve to make a racist feel their ignorance is rational and right. https://t.co/qqJnEjzX12

@Tammytheescort @be_praised @iamAtheistGirl None of you care about slavery as wrong, none of you feel any actual racism directed at you. Barbary Pirate enslavement (how many Barbary ppirates were there, since you are so hot on %, compared those engaged in slave trade/slavery in America." This performance is YOUR racism.
@Tammytheescort @be_praised @iamAtheistGirl You merged lots of topics trying to make them fit your only intent - to minimize slavery of black people in America, and equate the rebuke you get from black people for the thinking that makes you do this, into how white women were enslaved too! That's your racism, ignorance.
@Tammytheescort @be_praised @iamAtheistGirl When you cite a % of african slaves went to U.S., you assume they were just "slaves" as a natural state and disregard slavery as a legal system in the U.S., in which subsequent generations of increasing population were born into slavery, lived, died as enslaved, for centuries.
@Tammytheescort @be_praised @iamAtheistGirl You seem to "know" a lot of things that give you comfort about the things you already have decided to think. I don't think it matters that you are wrong on percentage of whites who owned/rented/exploited and does the percentage of slave shipment erase that all were enslaved?

@SusansFineArt @andy3974 @iamAtheistGirl I notice when someone approaches me with "I expect praise and gratitude for forcing myself to not be racist towards you despite your inferiority" vs. the person who is not demanding an award for interacting with me and isn't operating on stereotypes they can't have questioned.
@SusansFineArt @andy3974 @iamAtheistGirl Many white people think of they don't use the explicit racist language they've learned, then they are not otherwise being or showing racism. They change their words but they don't change the structure of their thinking and they imagine black people can't still feel it directly.
@SusansFineArt @andy3974 @iamAtheistGirl You were right about the difficulty of "working together" because those who approach with a "you better be grateful to how amazing I am for daring to not be as racist to you as everyone else is, never question me at all because I know my ideas are PERECT." This is what happens.
@SusansFineArt @andy3974 @iamAtheistGirl Akin to approaching someone discussing a serious permanent pain in their leg, difficulty of using a cane/wheelchair and how people poorly react to that, and angrily saying "my leg aches now and then when I run a lot, how dare you not consider what I face equal to your situation."
@SusansFineArt @andy3974 @iamAtheistGirl THEN she launches into the "I am a white woman being attacked by a racist black man" mode, her friends join in with "yes I too was question on something and oh god yes, I've suffered the racism from the blacks too" - all the while proving exactly what Aziz had on that chart.
@SusansFineArt @andy3974 @iamAtheistGirl Aziz posted a chart about racist levels and she instantly responds from one of the levels, gets mad that the blacks aren't grateful for her tolerance, and then equates her encounter with Aziz with the racism black people experience, and have faced for generations of our families.
@SusansFineArt @andy3974 @iamAtheistGirl Don't worry about her followers, just block them back. Her "well they hate themselves, that's why they bleach their skin, they are racist against themselves" was such an ignorant comment about impact of racism on the black community, what racism is, and that we all bleach.

@_h9xO @ceeworld21 @_Feyola_ Oh, I just finally saw your full header. It is sad when adults who presume to be so smart and aware still carry the idea that by punishing the one victimized they handle the abuse. This instinct to target the weak is disturbing, esp. since they wrap it in religious quotes.
@dubbydacious I will do that. The sun is up so I'm going to look and hope some snow is left.
@DysonDoll We know that's how many abusers go free and continue abusing for years. They can count on the "moral community" to make sure children know their abuse will be their fault and they will be punished if they "allow it." At the same time ensuring kids know they are to be submissive.
@Sirensongs Hey! I barely adjusted my eyes on twitter before I had to start swinging. Had a "lovely" MRI yesterday evening, so I'm still full of contrast dye and all "glowy." Glowy as in "try me." We finally have a snow that covers the ground, so that's a plus.
@_h9xO @ceeworld21 @_Feyola_ I find this linked to how adult women are blamed for being raped, but rapists are excused as lured, tempted, justified, etc. I do understand it as passivity and cowering. Abusers of this kind are given a respect and protection that kids, esp. girls, and women, do not get.
@_Feyola_ @ceeworld21 @_h9xO I bet you have all the bold chatter at people on every other silly topic but are proud of your upbringing to make abusers feel safe by advising your community to make kids afraid of reporting abuse because they will be beaten/shamed for not "avoiding it" - that's sick.
@_Feyola_ @ceeworld21 @_h9xO Ultimately, I am saying as an adult now you should not decide to tell girls "I was saved from abuse because I was beaten" but to be a strong enough adult to defend girls (and boys) from abusive adults. Don't grow up and stand with abusive men advising the kids get beat not him.
@_Feyola_ @ceeworld21 @_h9xO See the comments at me? They center on placing responsibility on a child to fend off an adult. The same people will tell you an adult woman is to be submissive to a man, and will also blame her if she is raped. When are these "behavioral specialists" going after the adult man?
@_Feyola_ @ceeworld21 @_h9xO I am not even thinking of your parents. I'm saying to you, that beating you wasn't protection, even if your parents in their fear about how to protect you, did that. That man could have still attacked you, and would it be your "failure" to stop him? No. You were a child.
@Yurickane @_Feyola_ That's at the heart of what I'm saying, people who don't confront corrupt adults, but can perform their morals only on children. Make the children responsible for whether or not they are abused. That is "punching down" when you don't fight the evil, just whoever is weaker.
@Yurickane @_Feyola_ Why do you think a child has "misdemeanors" when the bad behavior being discussed is an adult man's wrong behavior towards children? So you've learned to not address the abusive man, that's too hard, instead you target beating kids. That is what makes abusers feel safe.
@Yurickane @_Feyola_ It is a culture of cowardice to beat children to behave when you let them see you unable to "beat" the adults who abuse them. When a society shows abusers that kids will get beaten if they are abused, that empowers the abusers to tell kids "if you tell on me, they'll blame you."
@Yurickane @_Feyola_ The mental reasoning that if we beat her she is "safe" from him - as if whether or not he harms her is just about HER behavior, and not about his. So if I beat you will that keep you safe from robbers? No it will not, and you don't want to be blamed for their attempt to rob you.
@Yurickane @_Feyola_ If I was speaking to her father I'd tell him that he knew that little girl could not fight a grown man, but he thought beating her would make her win the fight? It is easy to just say "avoid that harmful person" - beating her meant if he did attack her, she'd feel she failed.
@Treasury_Trends @_Feyola_ I think that we are to protect boys and girls from adult men and women who are abusive, NOT to help abusers scare kids out of telling they are being abused. Why have a society where you show kids how corrupt adults go free, but beat kids for not stopping them? Why be so weak?
@ceeworld21 @_h9xO @_Feyola_ Truly, you missed the bible sections about defending the weak and being a sword against evil?  Bible didn't teach you to protect children and banish the wicked adults? Okay, so you just sort of used that bible as a fan on hot days and to repeat sentences you don't understand. Go.
@ceeworld21 @_h9xO @_Feyola_ So basically you learned that bible teaches you to not "spare the rod" with little kids, as a way to control the behavior of adult men who target little kids, and avoid using "the rod" on the adult men. So basically you learned religion from ministers who sexually abuse kids?
@_Feyola_ @Wahabade I can't imagine why I'm your aunty. I'm not even sure I like you.
@Wahabade @_Feyola_ I'm sure you'd never expect a little girl to win a fight with an adult man. But you argue that a little girl should be beaten and told she'll be punished if she doesn't. That's ignorant, and I gather you weren't taught to fight abusive adult men, just to beat little girls.
@Wahabade @_Feyola_ Sadly, I haven't even yet started "clubbing" as an adult, so what I'd have a child at age 1 doing is learning to walk, speak, taking them out in nature. I'd also raise them to never blame themselves for the behavior of an abuser, and to be free from worry that I'd ever do so.
@Wahabade @_Feyola_ You should be ashamed of how stupid that sentence sounds. You are so weak-minded you can't understand me criticizing the potential abuser and not the child he approaches. So if I don't beat the child, I want them to go clubbing? I'd confront the abuser, you coward. Not the kid.
@Treasury_Trends @_Feyola_ Look, since you are so passive towards men, you need to consider me a man and take your place of being too weak to question me -  because my tactic of hoping you can and would use your brain, reference ethics, to understand my point isn't working. Let's settle this on your level.
@Treasury_Trends @_Feyola_ You aren't armed with the right knowledge, nor the capacity to argue me if your tactics include calling me a one-sided feminist because I say the child doesn't deserve a beating. She grew up knowing how to beat a child and not to stop an abusive man. How amazingly weak.
@Treasury_Trends @_Feyola_ You can tell your child that man is harmful, and tell them why you want them mindful to avoid him. Beating a little girl doesn't make her strong enough to fight off an adult man. It means if he attacked her, she'd be fearful of telling because she "failed" to stop him.
@Treasury_Trends @_Feyola_ First, you are ignorant because I didn't mention being a feminist. But thank you for thinking I must be a feminist because I defend a girl from harm and aren't afraid to confront an abusive man. That's a damn good definition of a feminist and clearly the opposite of your values.
@ceeworld21 @_Feyola_ Don't give me lessons on how to beat children and not beat abusive men. That's something you have to learn young and refuse to fix in your brain as an adult. That is not something you can approach an adult with and explain to them why it makes sense. Stop trying.
@ceeworld21 @_h9xO @_Feyola_ You want to give me lectures on how adults are bold and brave to beat children, because their society cowers them to not confront abusive men. How they can beat their children, but can't fight corruption that threatens those children. They can both love their kids and be wrong.
@ceeworld21 @_h9xO @_Feyola_ Because you think there'd be a position in my life where I'd beat a child to stop an abusive man instead of confront that man for being abusive? You think as parent I'd not tell my child "That man is bad I will protect you" and then let that man know I am the wall he can't cross?
@Treasury_Trends @_Feyola_ Bible also has Lot's daughters getting him drunk and having sex with him, and both got pregnant. You need to learn discernment when you cite references for behavior in 2019. In Naija, people need to stop being cowards who beat children but let corrupt, abusive adults go free.
@Treasury_Trends @_Feyola_ You think a child needed a beating to learn a "lesson" about an abusive adult male, and couldn't have just been told why he was a danger and then have adults confront the man? The bible? Spare the rod? What? Really?
@Treasury_Trends @_Feyola_ I understand when parents feel more empowered by a society to beat their kids than to stop a child abuser. I understand where grown women think to get little girls to do their housework and when their husbands abuse those girls, they blame the girls, my words seem out of place.
@Treasury_Trends @_Feyola_ Even people who love us, can pass on ignorance to us. That doesn't mean we are now obliged to pass it on to others. Ideally our parents want us to learn better, do better, and it is better to tell adults to stop the adult men, and not go after the easy target, the children.
@Treasury_Trends @_Feyola_ Consider that cowardly approach of beating a child because of the behavior of an adult man towards her, because it is easier to terrify her than to block him. So when that abuser tells a victim "if you tell, they'll beat and blame you" and that's his added power over them.
@Treasury_Trends @_Feyola_ Yes, I do. I don't think she's horrible for believing as taught, I am simply speaking to that child who was beaten and saying "you didn't deserve that." I'm telling the young woman "don't tell others to treat girls that way" - and I have no doubt about my values on that point.
@DysonDoll she's creepy.
@ceeworld21 @_Feyola_ So basically for someone to keep you from being robbed, they should beat you so you hide your stuff better? You think a child deserved a beating to make her "protect herself" against an adult man? Someone made your brain this way and you are questioning me for not agreeing? Go.
@dubbydacious This winter is broken. It has been cold, but dusts of snow. Now the ground is covered, but still looks so thin. The sun will rise and melt much of it. You know I want to send you pictures of me struggling through thigh high snow drifts.
@ceeworld21 @_Feyola_ She's not fine because she was beaten. If you think beating a girl because a man is an abuser is good, you are a fool. And for her to advise others that beating a girl is a way to stop a man's abuse is abusive to other girls and women, it aids the predators.
@uncledietitian @_Feyola_ You think I'm a child who won't walk on your soul? Did my tweet indicate to you that anyone raised me to be someone you can tell not to speak? If only men like you were so bold with abusers, communities would be safer for everyone. But you save your banter for everyone else.
@AltruismIsUrSin @_Feyola_ Predators like that man often use that "you will get blamed/punished if you tell" reasoning to control victims. To disarm that weapon against his victims they need to know that they will not be blamed, they won't risk anger, shame, being rejected by family, community.
@_h9xO @ceeworld21 @_Feyola_ It isn't the argument that she was abused by this man, it was that she learned to see her being beaten as the way for adults around her to deal with this man. She could have still ended up his victim, and weakened by being blamed if she became one.
@_Feyola_ Your father taught you to shield abusive men and punish their victims/targets. This is how abusers get "whispered" about because people love the empty chatter, but the abusers don't get stop and their victims get shamed into silence.
@Tobiafolabi_ @survivor17 Perfect example of how women learn to protect abusive men and punish their victims.
@_Feyola_ Your father should have spoken to you about why the man was a danger to you, then beat the man in your defense. He didn't, so what you learned is when a man does wrong, a girl/woman must be beaten. Now you teach that to others. You shouldn't appreciate learning to spread that.

@NicT10 @OliviaTJohnson @honeybfly1980 @FredTJoseph I see similar, often. My morning commute (in the same area) is epic and my general stance is "Nope" as I move through the crowd. I believe in politeness, being gracious to people in need, ones who are showing similar values - but the ones who push up expecting me to shrink? Nope.
@wizdom4you ...and we switched, he had room and now I was the one she had to consider if it was wise to push up against. She stopped moving - and had already brazenly pushed aside about 4 people to get to that spot in the first place. I understand why the BM shrunk back - fear of accusation.
@wizdom4you .,on his front of body, with her back of body. I stared, she smirked, and he kept moving back to avoid that uncomfortable (and accusation laden) zone - as she expected. I was to the side of both, so out loud told him "I see your situation, let's switch spaces." He said thanks..
@wizdom4you But in that same environment he's describing, I watched a white woman pushing in crowded standing room only train for space, saw a young black man standing in a corner in a spot she wanted, pushed others to get there, and then turned her back to him, and start pushing up..
@wizdom4you I notice the ones who most typically demand - and get - the crowds parting like the Red Sea as they move, the rudeness that they expect everyone to tolerate, and their hesitation when they catch on to BW = "not the one." I dislike having to be in warrior mode just for a commute.
@wizdom4you This sounds like my crowded morning commute where I see people "demand space" on a clear white supremacist hierarchy and I have to put my politeness aside to manage attempts to literally push me aside, expect me to be trained to step aside, to concede to all sorts of rudeness.

Wonder who thought that up?
@Reverend_Lizard @SallyAlbright Would it be funny if it were the racists who are actually uncomfortable with the month because it reveals how much truth their elders denied them?

@Reverend_Lizard @SallyAlbright Let me provide a truth your parents didn't teach you - Racists are the ones who lack dignity.

@Reverend_Lizard @fnp129_linda @SallyAlbright Perhaps other families promote lies about their families' actions during horrific times of legal torture targeting black people, therefore it is important for THEM to minimize what occurred, but their lack of feeling doesn't mean black people aren't supposed to feel anything.

@brill_inst The era I grew up in was influenced by my elders who I actually think killed racists and buried their bodies somewhere in the woods. I don't recall my era being concerned with being included into racists' spaces or trying to "educate them to like us" as these new young folk are.
@brill_inst Ever meet someone who was so emotionally gutted and driven to tears, rage, mental distress when you don't allow them to hurt you the way they want? That's the scene in the show when the serial killer who thought he was smarter, gets caught and realize his spree is over forever.
@brill_inst They assume most of us don't see this whole crime spree they call a presidency and understand just how racism is giving it privilege to thrive. Meanwhile, we are supposed to go to jail for saggy pants and believe we deserve execution for flinching when cops point guns at us.
@brill_inst Exactly. I'm not calling someone racist hoping to hurt their feelings or inspire them to become better people, I'm letting them know "I see you" and will therefore assign them to the regard I give to racists, rather than to other humans. That's a different level of interaction.
@brill_inst Why would a man on camera stage a tantrum about being criticized for a racist-centered behavior as if his honor was unfairly impugned, yet knows he happily said on camera in front of a crowd that Obama should go back to Kenya? These people aren't right in the head.
@brill_inst In their minds - Their delusional feelings of self-pride &gt; Our entire lives and the lives of every generation of our families.
@brill_inst Being openly called a racist is a threat to a racist's sense of power. I think lots of these people inherited bitterness from elder who bragged about how much power their whiteness had in society and how much power they've lost. These maggot-y aspirations are sensitive.
@brill_inst You mean saying/writing it out loud or just thinking it?
@brill_inst I think being called a racist means 1. Racism is seen as wrong, instead of normal and right, 2. The ability to call them racist without fearing lynching or other punishment, means their power isn't as they think it should be - neither of which gives them comfort.
I'm tired of the daily "oooh guess what trump did!" from people who are still hoping their trumpian friends and family have souls and will finally respond to this new horror.

Being ceaselessly inundated with the superficial, the artificial, is unhealthy - but some people have never experienced otherwise, so what do they know or care? Except that they may some times notice something odd, not know why or what, and generally distract themselves anyway.
I really hope Spring doesn't come until we've had one or two or several really heavy snowstorms, but it doesn't seem like that is going to happen. The impact of this on agriculture, our environment in the coming months is underestimated by people who give little focus to nature.
@saigon_lion @Bamafanaticfan1 @AOC @realDonaldTrump I remain amused at how maggots will clap for the stupidest man on earth as their president, showing them to also be stupid, but like him constantly demand others "prove" their intellectual/academic level for them. Unless we are stupid and racist, trump supporters don't approve.
@Bamafanaticfan1 @AOC @realDonaldTrump Daddy's little wife doesn't "challenge" anyone, except her father's pussygrabbing habits. She's a fool, steals and cheats for anything she claims to "earn" - unless she means giving her father lap dances. She's stupid, but maggots don't understand "stupid" isn't a good thing.

@hudandan3 @LopesInsights My ancestors were taken from there. So in America we had our own fight - and still do. However, my blood remains with Africa, as do so many extended relatives and dear friends. I think the better of this world has to be rise above the worst, or else we all suffer.
@hudandan3 @LopesInsights I'm sure you also know that financial prosperity in China has not come without its corruption and pain for Chinese citizens. You have your political deficits. You would NOT want Chinese people controlled by other nations, so you cannot with good heart wish that on other people.
@hudandan3 @LopesInsights And no, there is not enough strong leadership in Africa that is not working more for Africa, than for China and others. In this world we must demand justice and well-being for all, and we know that comes from not being trained to be inferior to others.
@hudandan3 @LopesInsights That's the point. The idea that African doesn't have talent is one that, first - not true, and second, there is no way to nurture that talent if the focus is on fulfilling China's need for Africa's resources. I'd wish no less for any other nations.
@Suanta1 That too.
@hudandan3 @LopesInsights The prosperity of a few as pawns in a system that benefits China don't matter more than the need for Africa to control its own destiny. You'd not want for China what you claim is okay for African countries. How are you accessing the internet anyway?

@muscledean @JStephenClark It seems clear that like many, Sanders showed up to center himself and use what he did for his own ego, because I have yet to hear him say anything about non-whites and the racism they face that doesn't dismiss them as distractions from the priority of white people concerns.
@muscledean @JStephenClark Why do his supporters talk over and over about those few moments he showed up decades ago, but when people who actually face racism talk about their experiences, generations of family experience, it is silenced as "identity politics" and not an important "bread and butter" issue?

@AuntDebT @catholicdisco @LDN_akhi @Afg_Guerrilla Woman talked about the suffering of her loved one from cancer and your concern is "nicotine addiction is hard" - well fuck you, dealing with cancer is hard. Emphysema is hard. Seeing your loved-one suffer from an untreatable illness that will kill them is HARD. Quitting is EASIER
@AuntDebT @catholicdisco @LDN_akhi @Afg_Guerrilla So perhaps you STFU and read what I wrote, which was praising the woman for speaking up on this issue from her family experience and that she wasn't being judgemental at all to do so. Instead of doing the basic diligence you rushed in to defend smoking like you own stock in it.
@AuntDebT @catholicdisco @LDN_akhi @Afg_Guerrilla You sound like someone who is typically used to harming others in the course of your habits and expect them to remain silent. You also sound like someone who doesn't recognize concern for your well-being, even from loved ones, unless it caters to your petty need to not be judged.
@AuntDebT @catholicdisco @LDN_akhi @Afg_Guerrilla Even a person with an addiction needs to know when they do not live in a vacuum and their behavior affects other people. YOU describe enabling a narcissistic preoccupation with an addiction, rather than caring enough to tell a person why it is harmful to them and others.
@AuntDebT @catholicdisco @LDN_akhi @Afg_Guerrilla FOREMOST, nobody's addiction overrides the well-being of others around them and people who love that person have a right to tell them their behavior is harmful and causing harm to others. Just like someone addicted doesn't go without criticism for hurting, harming others.
@AuntDebT @catholicdisco @LDN_akhi @Afg_Guerrilla The basic health reality doesn't give a shit about addiction or personal battles or your attitude on it. The topic was concern for someone's risk and the risk they impose on others by smoking around them as PRIORITY over someone not wanting to be bothered by criticism.
@AuntDebT @catholicdisco @LDN_akhi @Afg_Guerrilla You don't know if i smoke or not, what you read was me stating it was more important to speak about the health risk of smoking than to worry about someone being offended at criticism. It is despicable for you to focus more on protecting the habit of smoking than someone's LIFE.
@AuntDebT @catholicdisco @LDN_akhi @Afg_Guerrilla Let me walk you through this, without calling you stupid. I said it was ego to be more upset over being criticized than to recognize someone alerting them to a threat to their life and the lies of others. Whether it was an addiction or not, it is harmful to health, that's the pt.
@SallyAlbright @emmnyc @aravosis That's what I do when I need extra money, I just print a batch of it. So sure, the government should just print lots and lots of money and distribute it. Maybe from kiosks set up all around the country. What could go wrong?
@GeneA22860 @latimes You don't believe in self-defense? Are you American and against fighting Nazis? You don't support our military defending our lives? Are you a terrorist sympathizer????
@GeneA22860 @latimes Are you actually against violence, or just confused about my choice of target? As an American, and as one who believes in saving lives, I am advocating not letting terrorists go free to harm our American citizens. Are you in favor of coddling abusers?
@GeneA22860 @latimes Only by fools. How about this, the next time a racist alleges they aren't racist, the question will be asked "How disgusting are they and why haven't they been hurt?"
@luth_chris @latimes Yeah, what kind of silly thinks racial inequality could ever exist in America? Nobody can show even one instance of that actually happening, not ever. Never happened, no laws, nobody ever experienced it. You are so brilliant and not at all a horribly ignorant person.
@chip_kyle @latimes Do you give that speech to racists? Are you yelling at trump, shouting at conservatives who talk about who is a "real" American and who isn't? Are you asking white supremacists about their motivations? Or are you just angry when non-white people talk about racism they face?
@latimes For victims of hate crimes, the people who make excuses for hate crimes are engaged in a larger betrayal. I don't know why this man did what he did, but I do know why so many rush to make an example of him while ignoring the racists and their supporters. https://t.co/X9n7aHHY21

Note, however that anyone can be passionate about anything, even negative things, and they remain negative despite someone's passion.

@SeriouslyAbsurd @CHURCHLADY320 She should bring her strengths to a team effort, because none of them can function alone and she has to learn that.
@SeriouslyAbsurd @CHURCHLADY320 A lot of those people went into Congress without any of the mass media support she can access instantly. That makes a big difference compared to the racist and sexist resentment they received, perhaps even far more than she has - likely given the times in which they started.
@SandraHudson84 @catholicdisco @LDN_akhi @Afg_Guerrilla Many cancers aren't related to smoking, but smoking itself contributes to other health risks that make other cancers harder to deal with. For your sister, of course she's countering her treatment and weakening her body to cope with treatment. Maybe reach out to her doctors?
@SandraHudson84 @catholicdisco @LDN_akhi @Afg_Guerrilla I'm sorry about your sister, and your family who died from it. Oddly, it isn't unusual for cancer patients to refuse to stop smoking. It is a habit and they often feel that at this point it doesn't matter anymore. Your sister should consider your trauma, as well as her health.
@LoaOfAnxiety @catholicdisco @LDN_akhi @Afg_Guerrilla What did I say that implies otherwise? Did I say anything that makes you think you know enough to teach me what you claim I don't know about cancer? You have lessons for me on cancer? Tell then. Did you run into my tweet that said cancer isn't the only health risk of smoking?
@SeriouslyAbsurd @CHURCHLADY320 I don't know how she is interacting with her colleagues, but I hope she isn't doing that very typical thing of trying to dominate a space based on her "social media fame" and instead, however she acts in public, has decided that she is there to work with, learn from, and share.
@SeriouslyAbsurd @CHURCHLADY320 She's mocked older people but perhaps is starting to see the strength it took to be in that space for years, esp. as non-white people, who didn't have the flattering attention of social media, about their appearance or other things to offset the resentment at their presence.

@autumnjohnay I think it is important to let them know smoking affects others, as well as themselves. Maybe you didn‚Äôt shame the person so much as alert them. We are often around people who endorse, enable things we do that are harmful and someone saying otherwise can reinforce a better idea.
@akwasiakomea @Yuhyuhyuhpenis @catholicdisco @LDN_akhi @Afg_Guerrilla Changing a behavior is hard, but coping with the potential physical damage of smoking (which is not just cancer) is far harder, so as with many things the decision faced is ‚Äúchoose your hard.‚Äù
@akwasiakomea @Yuhyuhyuhpenis @catholicdisco @LDN_akhi @Afg_Guerrilla Some people think saying ‚Äúaddicted‚Äù means you can‚Äôt do anything about it and therefore that absolves responsibility for it. It certainly doesn‚Äôt stop the physical outcome. Being sincerely concerned for someone‚Äôs health is a good thing, and isn‚Äôt about trying to be mean to them.
@Yuhyuhyuhpenis @catholicdisco @LDN_akhi @Afg_Guerrilla I said that someone not wanting to be told it isn‚Äôt good, is about ego. I did not say choosing to smoke is about ego. And ‚Äúaddiction‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make it protected territory from caring enough to tell someone it is risking their life and other lives.

@harrison_ka @DailyCaller What if this black man finally decided that appeasing racists wasn't his calling in life?
Years ago I could never imagine myself saying this, but Michael Steele is right. After years being the black man that racist republicans loved to pat on the head, he found trump's racism more than his soul could tolerate. Heart-broken republican thought he was trained for life
@unashamedusa @Liz_Wheeler Yep, he used to cater to racists and they loved him for it. I guess his soul caught up with him.
@decunningham2 I am surprised he spoke the truth and didn't care about "disappointing" people who expected him to always cosign their lies about the racism in their politics. I suppose he decided that truth, and honoring his ancestors, means more to him than appeasing their sense of control.

@henri_pew @walkdownman @PrincessMeerk @johnsjacoby1 @JohnalanJames2 @NickABC13 @abc13houston Even when someone is horrible to me I have to measure out the ethical need to control my own behavior in response as well as how easily I'm in the position to be punished more for defending myself depending on who the other person is.

@YasmineBallant1 @NickABC13 @abc13houston How is she able to physically assault people and get away with it?

If you find yourself needing too many extra words and academic concepts to explain simply being decent to all people as their thoughts and deeds merit, then you've lost the path of basic "not disgusting."

@meghan_daum You showed a genuine application of whiteness, and clearly you've communicated with too many black people who made you feel that you should even pretend to think of Crenshaw when you snatch a term to make it seem like you aren't talking about same old white people whiteness.
@meghan_daum Why do you think Crenshaw would give a damn about white people "intersecting" with each other? Why link her use of that term with white people at all? White people have been intersectional around their whiteness FOREVER. That's why so many white women voted for pussy grabber.

They don't, and it isn't progressive for us to pretend they do. Intersection doesn't mean justice.
@meghan_daum @robynkanner White political conservative has empathy for another white conservative and THAT is "real intersectionality?" Not a shocker and I don't care. I just wish black people stop worrying about proving their "intersections" with others and stop being guilted about defending each other.

@negrosubversive So many people are far more outraged by the idea of him lying than they are about millions of racist white people being racist every day and voting their racism. They want a submissive black response on this but they still haven't shown they give enough of a damn about racism.
@therealninjabob I see things and truly get your point. Trump spent decades openly mocking poor and poorer people, people who aren't elites, he became known for cheating workers who couldn't afford to sue him in court, so people in those positions who back him or just scarily devoted to hate.

@magicclams @SethAbramson Really, I'm only defending black women from inclusion in that -  others are either majority or moreso compatible with his racism, other disgusting qualities. There was no mass of "but Clinton's husband" or "but her emails" or other such stuff among black women.
@magicclams @SethAbramson Yes, as long as the distinction of "white women" is included.

@Kush_els Did you ever have a garden? If not, look through seed catalogs, often they give great details on older varieties, heirloom types, with interesting details that provide truthful information, compared to that GMO advertisement. You can start with this one: https://t.co/Ly34Gu93tz
@tanyalewis314 This article implies the other varieties, other than the commonly mass-marketed in America ones, are "extinct" and that is a lie. But people promoting GMO seeds would prefer we pretend suitable, easily available seeds don't exist. https://t.co/wuFrfCiPhz
@Kush_els GMO seeds are patented, controlled so one can't save or share seed legally, you must buy THEIR seed each year. Nature gave us seeds we can harvest from our plant. Each tomato has seeds for many more plants. More profit it patented seed than farmers owning their own land safely.
@Kush_els The banana issue is that instead of appreciating the diversity of nature, a few companies monopolized the market and their mono culture created a problem. There are hundreds of varieties of many plants, such as a tomato, that will grow in a variety of situations. Nature is GOOD.
@Kush_els Our earth is amazing, and we already have enough varieties of easily available seeds. That's the problem for GMO folks, they don't so much want to solve issues, as generate a need for their patented seeds that give them a monopoly and require dependence on buying only from them.
@Kush_els That mention of eggplant spines, I felt that - truly because every year I forget and grab to pull one off the plant as I do with some of the other kinds, and I get stabbed. They aren't little spines. I already have my purple carrot seeds. https://t.co/7dIqFJUkLR
@tanyalewis314 "selective breeding" didn't get rid of the spines on eggplants, because there are still eggplants grown with spines. That was a clear promo piece for GMS that depends on people only knowing the few mass marketed produce in America. https://t.co/S1CUQyfu98
@Kush_els What is true is that cultivation and preferences meant we, esp. in America, tend to only know what was chosen for mass market, but of course you go to a farmer's market/whole foods, etc. and see others, and around the world so many other varieties are grown. They all still exist.
@Kush_els It is a promo piece for GMOs that is outright lying about food crops. This is just a fraction of the varieties of eggplant, several of which I've grown. https://t.co/S1CUQyfu98
@tanyalewis314 Do you realize that eggplant with spines, in different colors, and purple carrots, etc. still exist and are regularly grown even though they aren't familiar the mass marketed varieties? You do know cultivated hybrids aren't the same as GMO. https://t.co/wuFrfCiPhz
@Kush_els But I grow ones with spines, and in other colors, every year. I was just tweeting with a friend this morning about growing purple/black carrots because he mentioned seeing red ones. There isn't one variety of any of these items, even as human cultivated and promote hybrids.
@Kush_els I'm surprised that article is so bogus. I thought it was the typical article about domestication, and it ended with so "we already are" GMO propaganda. I caught on when it mentioned eggplants used to have spines, and the modern variety doesn't. As if the other varieties are gone.

@therealninjabob You are fine. It's that little ninja costume that saves you.
@therealninjabob @DiamondandSilk The saddest aspects were as an extension of slavery, where a child who showed talent was owned by people who marketed the child to perform. As you can imagine, and as my mind refuses to delve into now, the exploitation was horrific, the abusive environments and miserable deaths.
@therealninjabob Some were black performers who really had great skills, were smart and had talents, but also had no options. A job that paid, but they'd get murdered literally if they said what they really felt, so they bitterly play along. Others were whites, who fulfilled that racist need.
@therealninjabob Whenever people see any of us and have toxic assumptions about our inferiority, and we already know who we are and how they are towards us, we have a lovely opportunity to decide whether we want to smirk and walk away, or inflict damage on our enemies. Rest or test the sword?
@therealninjabob @DiamondandSilk Some minstrel performers were black people who had no options, and were mocking racists to their faces by showing them how their own mind works - contrary to their illusions about their values. These trolls aren't that, but they do lull racists into a possibly useful stupor.
@therealninjabob @DiamondandSilk Twitter is a vast mural created by people, some accurately conveying reality, others poorly trying without the skills, good people with great messages, others trying to ruin the mural, others are sociopaths looking for fear and attention, and so on.
@therealninjabob @DiamondandSilk Sad fact is that racists hoping to encounter black people who love their B.S., using diarrhea and piss as their expectation of the response they'll get, will almost always just get their "feelings" hurt.
Paid to betray their ancestors and mock their own people @DiamondandSilk are like Jewish people who perform to entertain Nazis. While racists wait for #MAGA policies to force submissiveness on all black people, and if they can't openly wear blackface, they get to watch them.
Toxic creatures @DiamondandSilk are a minstrel show for racists. Their version of a "healing" image after dealing with black people they can't control, situations where their racism is slapped down, flashbacks of that black president, that new black neighbor in the better house.

@CathyCrj21 @Schnickels1 @CNN Jim Crow laws would still be legal if we allowed the "fall somewhere in the middle" people to enshrine the standard of passivity to racism that doesn't bother them at all because it doesn't target them and they were raised in families who normalized it. Weak ethics are harmful.
@CathyCrj21 @Schnickels1 @CNN Unless we aren't white then we lean on the side against racists, and whatever political party the racists find comfortable we do not. I do understand how some white people feel sad that racists and "claim to not be racist" white people aren't agreeing on racism like the old days.
@HenryRasmussen @CNN Gosh, wouldn't want to knock anyone for using blackface, and if you equate blackface with this imaginary "white face" phenomena I guess people pretend exists just to have a reason to minimize the vicious racist history of blackface, then you are tolerant of the wrong thing.

@DesignerErica27 @nightowl22366 @Deadpan_Joker @kylegriffin1 Perhaps for you it is "pig-headed" to maintain anti-racist values and not cower to racist people who cause harm to others by supporting political trash, so they don't feel "criticized" about their poor choices, but it isn't for me. No more of this coddle deplorable, B.S. pls.
@DesignerErica27 @nightowl22366 @Deadpan_Joker @kylegriffin1 People who support a racist, grifter, liar for president don't decide to keep supporting him because we say "I told you so" -  they only keep supporting him for the same reason they first supported him, their home training endorses racist, grifter, liars. That is their flaw.
RT @soulphoodie: Black Farmers Grapple With A Changing Economy  https://t.co/OCDPbefRwV  via @BuzzFeed https://t.co/bCpevFQbqH
The basic fact is @AIPAC is only different from other white supremacist groups because of religion, and if they were fighting actual anti-semitism they wouldn't partner with racist groups - they are using anti-semitism to justify their own white supremacist violence.
It is a disgusting day when I see @AIPAC trending for attacking someone for criticizing their persistent financial corruption, and know they will never actually oppose anti-semitism when it comes from the white supremacist groups they hope to rally for their own racist campaigns.
Every one who has engaged in national/international political advocacy, been around the arena of the U.S. Congress, and other such policymaking bodies, has seen @AIPAC use financial influence to cower ethical opposition to their racism, murderous activities. That's just fact.
@AIPAC I don't remember seeing loud rebuke from AIPAC about all the "Soros money, Jewish cabal" slander out of Team Trump. I don't see them question Trump the neo-nazi anti-Jewish supporters he endorses. Why? Because white supremacy brings them all together on a mission that comes 1st.
It is like I can't see anything else on my TL until I somehow swat at, sweep away all the "entertaining the racists" activity. At the core, America has filthy racist grifter @realDonaldTrump for president and he inspires all the worst people and organizations to show their ass.
@AIPAC Trump has his own anti-Semitic agenda with his team of supporters but AIPAC isn't going to question that, as long as they can get what they need from the U.S. government. Their support for Trump's racism says all anyone needs to know about their organizational values and intent.
@AIPAC Trump and @AIPAC would conspire to strip American citizenship from non-white Americans who question Israel and white supremacist racism. A traditional American value and interest of millions of Americans is opposing racism and AIPAC's financial lobbying isn't going to deter us.

@Joy_Villa Too bad you can't make money with your music.
The racists weren't buying her music, so she needed to stage another stunt to entertain them and sell her music - since her singing isn't enough.

@_0ldSchool1 @mastectomyjay @little_emmabird @double_whammied @abcdiagnosis It is relevant and appropriate for people to choose to speak up to reinforce an important concern, esp. since "save the tatas" type campaigns pop up repeatedly on social media. Deciding what is out of date/inappropriate to speak about, yet not knowing that fact, is very odd.
@originalspin However, while some "brown" people blended in with the white people, many did not, would not and wanted more than subservience as cheap workers and being praised as better than black people, they wanted equal status with white citizens, and suddenly those brown people become bad.
@originalspin Not so long ago, Republicans expected all "brown" people to be submissive to and aspirational within white supremacy, and the chant was how "brown people" were good workers and black people were bad, demanding undeserved basic rights &amp; human respect. Many "brown" leaders agreed.

@gindaanis @KimTallBear @KateriAkiwenzie @Zemrag7 @AgentNdn @BigIndianGyasi That's why Black anti-racist leaders and movements became images/quotes used by non-black POC. Our anti-racist values were loud, included activism by the mass of our community for generations, and reflect how we did not accommodate or exploit racism towards other POC as a tactic.
@gindaanis @KimTallBear @KateriAkiwenzie @Zemrag7 @AgentNdn @BigIndianGyasi The black community did not fight racist behaviors coming from white people by complaining it was "preposterous" for them to be more than other non-white groups got. We fought the actual racism/racists, making it clear that we oppose racism not just against black people.

@KimTallBear @KateriAkiwenzie @gindaanis @Zemrag7 @AgentNdn @BigIndianGyasi I consider that the effort non-black POC communities have devoted for so many generations towards being anti-black and seeking favor with white people because of it, is the gap where they lose needed effort, focus, and impact in attacking racism towards them from white people.
@KimTallBear @KateriAkiwenzie @gindaanis @Zemrag7 @AgentNdn @BigIndianGyasi It is preposterous for non-black POC to question why a racist behavior towards black people is "less acceptable" than a similar one towards them, as if it violates some racial hierarchy, rather than represents how hard we fight against racism towards us from EVERYBODY ELSE.
@KimTallBear @KateriAkiwenzie @gindaanis @Zemrag7 @AgentNdn @BigIndianGyasi Black people devoted many generations of arguing that blackface is negative, and it took a very long time to reach "obviously bad" yet people still do and defend it. We took the hate (incl. violence) for refusing to accept this and other racist behaviors as normal.

@bryanhansel @thewhalerphotos @AndrewYangVFA I don't remember when he wasn't a known racist. His casino employees called him a racist. He has been disgusting for decades.

@Nikyatu Notably, you said "perturbed as to why" rather than "don't know why" - 'cause we know why. It is disappointing that once again we have to speak up for the ones that get ignored, despite how amazing they are.
Judging from all the complaining tweets and articles, it seems many racist white people didn't know they weren't rich. All that talk about lazy poor black people in urban areas on welfare etc. apparently made muddled their perception of their own net worth and paychecks.
Not only is @realDonaldTrump a putrid puddle of slime, but he has a decades-long habit of gathering as many other grifter perverts to join him every where he goes. He only brings the worst people to help him do the worst things. Team Trump is a plague. #MAGA for maggots.
I should have gotten signed deals for payment from people who questioned my pre-election assertion that trump would create a trail of filth every day, if he were allowed to be president AND that there were enough degenerates, racists, to help vote him in as president.
@BigIndianGyasi Blackface generates outrage because masses of black people over many generations were LOUD against racism towards them, thereby making racism a target. It is EXHAUSTING when non-black POC take black people resisting racism as some threat to their own well-being. That's not us.

@dsnymse028 @MattDav72811123 @realDonaldTrump You think the people harmed by racists, whose families have been brutalized, murdered, enslaved by these long traditions of racists in America, must worry about "belittling" the people who promote that harm? Nope, that "protect the racists" bullshit isn't ethical or tolerable.
@dsnymse028 @MattDav72811123 @realDonaldTrump Awfully bold to advise that we can criticize trump, but can't criticize  people who share his disgusting mentality, values, behaviors and help prop him up? Why do these people deserve special protection from the ones they target? They belittle themselves by being racists.
@dsnymse028 @MattDav72811123 @realDonaldTrump I am free to belittle someone for being racist, and be sure that he isn't the only racist in America and he wouldn't be potus if it weren't for a lot of people who, just like him, deserve belittling for their disgusting attitudes towards other people.

@eliz_avery @puremalarkey @leftyjennyc I find many people don't actually know what justice is, and never considered that it may include letting go of unfair privileges they don't deserve. There is a component of selflessness that isn't really a character trait many people recognize, much less allow themselves to have.
@eliz_avery @puremalarkey @leftyjennyc Many ignore the same voices that the people they call "right wing" do, and don't notice it because that isn't the system they want to change. Mingling with non-whites as some sort of token feat of bravery "RADICALISM" to intimidate right-wing whites isn't impressive to me.
@puremalarkey @eliz_avery @leftyjennyc Justice has been on the tongues of black people since the beginning of America, and we forced America to consider justice for all a reality. We are the last group of people who need others newly familiar with the word to tell us about it. Our dedication is written in blood.
@puremalarkey @eliz_avery @leftyjennyc Have you seen the movie "Rosewood" or read the history? Are you familiar with the Tulsa race riot? Have you noticed how racist white people, even the poorest ones, will reject economic justice for themselves if it means "for all" - not just white people? That must be addressed.
@puremalarkey @eliz_avery @leftyjennyc Racism has been the reality for all of America's history and that cannot be ignored while centering economic justice that has never existed at all. It would never be equated, much less subsumed, except for the sides of the issues being as they are.
@puremalarkey @eliz_avery @leftyjennyc If you are white you can be surrounded by racists/racism and still have economic justice. If you are black, surrounded by racists/racism, you can be rich and write your net worth on your forehead every day and still face racism from white people both richer and poorer than you.
@puremalarkey @eliz_avery @leftyjennyc My grandmother spoke of white socialists advising her that race wasn't the issue, economics was, even as lynchings were actively in the news. They were safe, and really didn't sense racism was so real or so painful since most everyone they racist was really friendly with them.
@puremalarkey @eliz_avery @leftyjennyc For people who have those experiences because of their race, there isn't any doubt - unless they decide to tow the line promoted by people who don't face racism, and therefore decide it can't really be a big issue and have other reasons to whitewash the impact of racism.
@puremalarkey @eliz_avery @leftyjennyc Have you noticed the difference between someone being racist towards you, and someone demeaning you because you are poor/er? Have you experienced how despite your higher economic status, others are still racist towards you and assume they are superior regardless of their income?

@TheCrimsonCreek @rareseeds Generally, I slice and put in the oven on low for a while. I've tried to sun-dry paste tomatoes, and that is always too risky for me/I mess it up. I have yet to try a dehydrator. I realized that tomatoes I leave sitting on the table for a while, tend to do better when frozen.
@TheCrimsonCreek This year I may go for a stuffing tomato too. I think one of the joys of tomatoes is growing so many of the types that are rarely seen (or really expensive if seen) and the different ways you can use them. I'm bad at this question because I'm always exploring for new favorites.
@TheCrimsonCreek I tend to stick with a red/pink, but this year I'm considering a yellow or black as well. Other tomatoes I've settled on: Jersey Devil and Dr. Wyche's Yellow Tomato, neither of which I've ever grown. I always over-tomato, so I'm still seed shopping for at least two or three more

@TheCrimsonCreek The Romas I dry or sauce, the cherries I freeze whole, while the others I eat, or expect to keep for a shorter time. For other than cherry/grape tomatoes, that aren't Roma, I find letting them dry out a bit, let's them last longer (textural quality) even frozen.
@TheCrimsonCreek I often end up with at least one Better Boys, and several Brandywines. I like BBs consistency, Brandywines depth of taste. Adding in a cherry tomato provides easy snacking. Roma types get most stored. Priority is the spread of types, and then I tend to try new varieties within.

@Leslieks All that to say, these sorts of circles are overpopulated by sociopaths and the people who try to get along/friendly with them. That's why anyone even vaguely honest, less tainted, is treated like they are flinging holy water at demons as they walk. This is pure foolery in VA.
@Leslieks That's how I "met" her - first week dorm meeting, and that was her first comment, she was horrified by her roommate. Not long after she revealed that she never drank anything except if absolutely necessary because she didn't like the feeling of swallowing. I AVOIDED her.
@Leslieks I knew someone in college - not friends, I was horrified by her - who spoke then about "gathering info" on people she thought would be her eventual opposition. She also complained about getting a black SA roommate bcse she felt the "terrorist link" would ruin her CIA aspirations.
@Leslieks Tactically, you don't want to show your hand too early. I also think they are rushing to gather info on targets they didn't first prioritize - hopefully that means pain is coming on their side soon.
@Leslieks These little "details" also show why so many Democrats go easy on racist Republicans - familiarity with the mentality and a reason to make excuses for it. Republicans will do far worse, and smile about it proudly, while making sure to shame others who aren't shielded from rebuke.
Now, let's ponder how hard the Republicans worked, how much money and time they shelled out, to get dirt on Obama and couldn't do it. Now realize that Trump provides dirt on himself every day and Democrats don't make use of it to smother him. Republicans love him for it, though.
@Leslieks First, it's Virginia. Second, Republicans work far harder to dig up and fling shit to win, than do Democrats. Third, It's Virginia.

@LateToTheGame5 @sairasameerarao Either you realized your home training is distorted or you realized mine wasn‚Äôt. https://t.co/h0LPUpkMS6
@LateToTheGame5 @sairasameerarao I suggest you consider that the way you were taught to promote racism as normal and good, will not work on people who know racism is not to be accepted as normal and is never good. You tried it, though.
@LateToTheGame5 @sairasameerarao I can‚Äôt become a racist by being angry at a racist. Being racist requires thinking that is racist, it is not defined as ‚Äúbeing angry at someone for their racism towards you.‚Äù You under the difference but you are just shocked that your ‚Äúbe obedient‚Äù advice is rejected.
@LateToTheGame5 @sairasameerarao If you are nice to your abuser, they will abuse you more nicely! The important thing here is you‚Äôll be a bad person if you aren‚Äôt nice to your abuser.‚Äù &lt;‚Äî- persistent chant of abusers and people protecting abusers
@LateToTheGame5 @sairasameerarao And if you are telling me to be nice to someone hurting me, people I care for, and others like me, how should I consider you and your advice? Not very nicely, right?
@LateToTheGame5 @sairasameerarao Notice how saying I‚Äôm a racist unless I‚Äôm nice to racists, really isn‚Äôt centering ‚Äúnice‚Äù as a value - it is shaming/guilting me to be submissive to racists who hurt me, which only helps racists. That‚Äôs not nice is it? Where did you learn to do that to people targeted by racists?
@LateToTheGame5 @sairasameerarao Have you considered that telling someone ‚Äúbe nice to someone racist to you or else you are a bad person‚Äù is demented because you are also saying to racists ‚Äúif the person you are being racist to, isn‚Äôt nice to you in return they are being racist too‚Äù because it favors the racist?
@LateToTheGame5 @sairasameerarao So I‚Äôll become racist if I‚Äôm not nice to someone who is racist towards me. Same with rape or domestic abuse or bullying? Or is it just with racism that unless I‚Äôm nice to the person hurting me, I become just like them. Are you nice to people who hate/hurt you and your family?

@edfcarrasco @MaggieBeeBach @GardenerAngry @DennisMJordan @realDonaldTrump @GOP I saw a team trump statement this morning about how returning stolen children to their families would traumatize them - so better they remain with the families who lined up to pay for them. What? Anyone who cheers for evil like that deserves so much more pain than a tax increase.
@edfcarrasco @MaggieBeeBach @GardenerAngry @DennisMJordan @realDonaldTrump @GOP Seems likely Maggie has trump-loving family and friends, and her home training makes her demand we be submissively polite to their hatefulness, or else WE are the mean people. She may not be pro-trump, but she also believes we are inferior to those people so can't criticize them.
@edfcarrasco @MaggieBeeBach @GardenerAngry @DennisMJordan @realDonaldTrump @GOP Trump is chanting about a see-through steel wall, and the only ones praising him - and the billions of dollars of waste - are people whose hate makes them imagine that a see-through steel wall will keep out - and harm - the people they hate to see as equal citizens around them.
@edfcarrasco @MaggieBeeBach @GardenerAngry @DennisMJordan @realDonaldTrump @GOP You were absolutely right.

@MaggieBeeBach @GardenerAngry @edfcarrasco @DennisMJordan @realDonaldTrump @GOP Racists are racist because they are racist, not because other people oppose racism.

@MaggieBeeBach @GardenerAngry @edfcarrasco @DennisMJordan @realDonaldTrump @GOP I don't have to be humble to racists and people who vote for a racist.

That sounds legitimate to you. But I suggest they chose the person they wanted, and that sounds wrong.
@MaggieBeeBach @GardenerAngry @edfcarrasco @DennisMJordan @realDonaldTrump @GOP What is horseshit is this perpetual "oh they didn't mean it" "oh they aren't bad people" excuse that every generation gets despite the horrors, the hate, they act out, vote for, against others. Horseshit is trying to pretend these people are just lovely folk who vote for hate.
@MaggieBeeBach @GardenerAngry @edfcarrasco @DennisMJordan @realDonaldTrump @GOP They voted for trump when he showed them what he was. They saw him attack Obama repeatedly, including claiming he wasn't American, didn't earn his academic degree, etc. that is just one of the many things they saw and voted for - you want to pretend that isn't about who they are?
@MaggieBeeBach @GardenerAngry @edfcarrasco @DennisMJordan @realDonaldTrump @GOP People targeted by the hate of team trump definitely don't need to "respectfully" tell them they deserve even more pain than they get. They want to drag America backwards out of nostalgia for other Americans being legally abused, excluded, for which their elders also got excused.
@MaggieBeeBach @GardenerAngry @edfcarrasco @DennisMJordan @realDonaldTrump @GOP They didn't know they'd have to pay "extra" for the abuses they wanted him to launch at others. They had added fees for his racist comments, hateful policies - and they got what they wanted. Why not admit these people are arsonists out to kill and upset they smell like smoke?
@MaggieBeeBach @edfcarrasco @DennisMJordan @realDonaldTrump @GOP The only lie was that he'd hurt other people, but not them - and that is their fault. They deserve far more than the hurt they caused, and hope to cause, others. They voted for a racist, grifter, and cheered his lies when it fit their ignorance. Stop giving their evil an excuse.

@SaarduLady LOOK at what is going on. If a racist is attacking someone one the person being attacked isn't the one who needs to set aside "prejudicial thoughts" - it isn't prejudice if you judge someone for being racist towards you no more than it is if they physically slap you. See reality.
@SaarduLady @IlhanMN @LeeZeidman It isn't about "these two" getting along, it is about Zeidman not being racist and encouraging other racists to attack her.

If we don't have a longer winter, with more snow, we won't have enough water to sustain us with a long, hot summer. I already see that I need to help smother out the weeds and insects that will flourish in an overall too warm, too wet winter. I need to help out nature.
Humans need to respect nature. Nature already gives humans more than we deserve, it certainly does not need to respect us.
Isn't it odd how people who claim to be devoted to God/religion are amazingly dismissive of nature? They really can't imagine how being destructive with God's earth would lead to some sort of rebuke? Not like God would ever flood the earth as punishment....

@VanBizWiz @_SJPeace_ @suestroud A happy racist is still a racist, who is happy to be racist and that's why they are racist whether they are stressed, poor, rich, happy, drunk, well-fed, and so on. Had she been slapped into the concrete, that may have addressed her feeling of freedom to attack strangers.
@VanBizWiz @_SJPeace_ @suestroud The people she is attacking aren't the issue at all and perhaps you've experienced being sick where you take care of the symptoms and the root cause. A racist will make rain their reason for being racist, and her racism is always a problem in itself.
@CpaGentleman @Bakari_Sellers @MattatTheState @AveryGWilks It is lazy to assume that people experiencing racism cannot speak about it until someone like you decides it is worth speaking about, as if they are supposed to trust your assessment of facts? Exactly, I know you don't care about racism, and you know I don't care if you do.
@CpaGentleman @Bakari_Sellers @MattatTheState @AveryGWilks I don't know you, and don't actually care. I'm simply letting you know that nobody is going silent on racism just because you threaten them with not caring about racism unless they go silent when you prefer. I'm saying your words reveal you as a view nobody is depending on.
@VanBizWiz @_SJPeace_ @suestroud Sometimes it is uncomfortable to admit that people like this aren't forced to be racists, they are racists who have acted this out all their lives. This time was just caught on video. She attacked people for speaking a language foreign to her - SHE is stress to them.
@VanBizWiz @_SJPeace_ @suestroud Assuming "social stresses" cause bigotry, as if bigotry is some new thing in society, is silly. People are racist because they are racists. Many people have "social stresses" it does not make them racist nor does it justify being racists and attacking people.
Racists always seem shocked and offended that black people don't like them because of their racists words and actions. Mainly for two reasons, black people having the power to not like racists scares them, and they don't actually understand that their racism isn't good and right.
@deecee2018 @BuckSexton oh no! Someone black doesn't like racists! How can that be? We know that black people are supposed to love the racist confederate flag waving piles of trash who are generations of hate crimes against black people. How dare he not love racists? Idiot.

@MaxBoot I cannot disagree with someone who believes I am inferior due to my race without being disagreeable. Just because others can be friendly with racists who don't target them, doesn't mean those targeted can or should. People who can't criticize evil don't get to set civility rules.
@AmbHarper @ciaogirl9 @JackieC1989 @MaxBoot You could have done a better job of specifically defending @maxboot than a generic statement about the need for civility by avoiding calling something or someone racist. The best of Americans are the ones who stood against racism directly, not fearing being uncivil with truth.
@AmbHarper @ciaogirl9 @JackieC1989 @MaxBoot I hope your comment takes into account that in 2019 we don't have to hear something racist and always pretend it is "misspeak" to protect the speaker when the words are clear and offensive. Civility isn't being nice to racists, it is NOT being racist. Presume that as a priority.
@AmbHarper @ciaogirl9 @JackieC1989 @MaxBoot No. This situation aside, the implication of "presume racism" is that that benefit of the doubt goes to the person who made the statement, and the burden is on the one targeted by it to doubt their perception. I suggest you consider the implicit imbalance of that "civility."

@LaNegrindia We benefit from a society that has eradicated much of what used to routinely kill adults/children, so it is easy to take for granted, also why we are so unprepared for epidemics. We lost the cultural habits that tried to ward off death back when we couldn't avoid any of it.
@LaNegrindia I see your tweets and know you aren't THE ENEMY, but the risk on twitter is not taking the time to read beyond one tweet. That's why I remind myself to scan people's other tweets/following/followers before I let loose on how grimy they are.

@blackgirlinmain Petty commuting issue that I find fits life, because I'm trying to make it through my day whole and happy as possible, other people think I look too happy, move too confidently, simply because they want to see me shrink for them. I don't treat others that way.
@blackgirlinmain Back to commuting more often, every day I find myself saying "NO" and "MOVE" - directly to people's faces. Why? People act like they don't see me and that I'm supposed to know the hierarchy of life to step back, cede space I occupy to them. I give correction.
@blackgirlinmain People will smile in your face while watching you shrivel, especially if it somehow benefits them. Some people are silly enough to simply think if you don't "shine" too much it makes them glow more - so even without actual benefit, they'll still try to drain you of joy.
I don't care about the Nigerian vs. African-American wars, those who are bigoted against the other are idiots. African-Americans carry a mass of the same blood as Nigerians, and we overlap in so many ways culturally - I care about the world too but Nigeria/Africans have my heart.

@2BGMEDIA @LilyMiranda07 Ok, I avoiding looking at trump stuff to cross cultural barriers yet still squaring off with anti-blackness. At least we got to chat. Thanks for the Rosie clip, I'm saving it to hurt someone's feelings w/o all the tweets with words. You, be well. I need to shake off these folk. https://t.co/bbYOF0GkA7
@2BGMEDIA @LilyMiranda07 I'm tired of the white racism in every language. Tired of the tears, tired of the "well be nice to us and educate us" from people who are whitesplaining why their racism requires our labor to serve them and trying to teach us their whitewashed version of life as if we can't see.
@2BGMEDIA @LilyMiranda07 Tell (remind) a white Argentinian person that the Tango, was originally "Tango de los Negros" and their national dance is from the black folk, they'll often claim they don't have any black people who aren't immigrants. Well, that's because of targeted genocide.
@2BGMEDIA @LilyMiranda07 Watching Latino media is horrifying with how anti-blackness is normalized. It's like they think if they say racist crap in spanish no "black" people will understand it, and afro-latino people have to accept it. Thanks for sharing the Rosie clip - seeing is better than reading it.

@2BGMEDIA @LilyMiranda07 I watched the show where he mocked her, he was really happy with himself until he got that slap back, notice how he too" has afro-latinos" in his family. Anti-blackness happens as a norm in America-based latino media but notice only Hollywood gets a mention for excluding them.

@2BGMEDIA @LilyMiranda07 I loved the show too.
@2BGMEDIA @LilyMiranda07 As you can tell, I hate HATE HATE when white/whiter/wanna.be.white.real.bad Latinos erase Afro-Latinos by using that latino v. black framework. They erase Afro-Latinos, demeans them, as a norm, but then wants to claim BA's should overlook that in giving THEM respect. Nope.
@2BGMEDIA @LilyMiranda07 That's an Afro-Latino song, from Yoruba culture. But when white/r Desi Arnez took it to the mainstream, it was just this "Latino" thing he did. https://t.co/G35e2AoTAO
@2BGMEDIA @LilyMiranda07 You are probably not old enough to have see the "I Love Lucy" show, where Lucy's husband is "Ricky Ricardo" (played by her real husband) who is a cuban musician, know for his "Baba Lu" and white folks loved it.... https://t.co/JsF3fptKar
@2BGMEDIA @LilyMiranda07 I worked with networks of afro-latino groups in every hispanic country, and the weight of their history vs. how the general latino society acknowledges their presence - while stealing afro-latino culture and calling it "Latino" is massive. Much like white americans re: AAs.

@2BGMEDIA @LilyMiranda07 Celia Cruz singing Toro Matamakes me weepy with how it is a loud shout from Afro-Latinos, that fits right in with the voices of black people all across the Americas who survived the middle passage and still fight. We fight together, let Gina cry. https://t.co/TS6bAzZrSt
@2BGMEDIA @LilyMiranda07 Lastly, one of my other favorites is "Toro Mata" - an afro-peruvian anthem, an afro-latino anthem. Susana Baca is peruvian, was member of gov't, massive role in highlighting afro-peruvian culture. This is a great background on the song. https://t.co/RLJc8o3Met

@2BGMEDIA @LilyMiranda07 It's that gaslighting, "Latino community vs. black community" like they never see black people in their own community. Azucar Negra and La Negra Tiene Tumbao (Celia Cruz), Negra Presuntosa (Susana Baca) so much afro-latino culture speaking to its blackness and being erased.
@2BGMEDIA @LilyMiranda07 Lighter/white latino people are used to telling afro-latino people how to react to anti-blackness. Black people aren't small parts of latino culture, the majority populations of blacks in America are in Brazil and Colombia, more than in the United States. Black people all over.
@2BGMEDIA @LilyMiranda07 That "I'm not afro-latino" is more about her own anti-blackness, and home-training tried towards non-hispanic blacks who weren't socialized to tolerate anti-blackness as she is familiar. It is erasing visibly, overtly black people as spanish conquistadors intended.
@2BGMEDIA @LilyMiranda07 Gina Rodriguez didn't learn her anti-blackness exclusively towards non-hispanic blacks, she's rolling that out towards afro-latinos. Notice how she said HER COUSIN and her dad are afro-latino, but she touches her skin to indicate she is light enough to avoid that label for her.
@2BGMEDIA @LilyMiranda07 As soon as a latino person frames the issue as "black vs. Latino" you know their brain is distorted on this topic, and that they have deliberately erased afro-latinos, and THAT is the foundation of their anti-blackness. The assumption those people are less "latino" than they.
@2BGMEDIA @LilyMiranda07 Exactly. She assumes she's speaking to people with total ignorance of existing and history of anti-blackness and the african presence in hispanic countries, and she clearly her own ignorance about afro-latino history that enables her to assign blackness as "non-latino."
@LilyMiranda07 @2BGMEDIA We will condemn anti-blackness w/o guilt, same as we will condemn racism from anglo whites w/o guilt. Feel free not to condemn the Spain/Castilians who look down on the mulato "Latinos" if you favor kindness to bigotry. On that note, https://t.co/e67rmsclEd
@LilyMiranda07 @2BGMEDIA Non-hispanic black people should be listening to hispanic black people most of all and not convinced to ignore their experiences of anti-blackness from white/lighter latino people. Afro-latino's points are VALID, and defending anti-blackness as an "oopsie, educate us" is not.
@LilyMiranda07 @2BGMEDIA If the anglo "black community" offends non-black hispanic people by interrupting their anti-blackness, that simply means those people are harmful to afro-latinos too, and since those are our kin who came to Americas just like us, we don't owe you passivity, we owe THEM support.
@LilyMiranda07 @2BGMEDIA Foremost, you need to consider how "Latino culture" erases the indigenous and african people it consumed to create itself, and how it elevates the whiteness of conquistadors over the people they slaughtered and enslaved. More slave ships stopped in those lands than in the U.S.
