James is right again! A4: June 21, 1788 #ConstitutionDay  https://t.co/7na24Sh9ZK
Q4: The U.S. Constitution was signed September 17, 1789. When was it ratified by the necessary nine states? #ConstitutionDay #trivia
The answer to Q3 is TRUE! #ConstitutionDay #trivia
Q3: True or false: the word "democracy" does not appear in the U.S. Constitution. #ConstitutionDay #trivia @cspanhistory @CapitolHistory
James is right - the answer to Q2: Benjamin Franklin! #ConstitutionDay #trivia https://t.co/ferQmVk64g
@Mebraav That's correct! Nicely done.
Q2: Who was the oldest person to sign the U.S. Constitution? #ConstitutionDaytrivia @cspanhistory @CapitolHistory @HISTORY

Just released: The Rigell Report!  Read here: http://t.co/h0CcMWd01Z
@Super_Dad_Esq These folks are at a townhall on a Saturday morning talking about the challenges facing America - nothing lazy about that.
As promised: "I'm working on fixing the redistricting process w a Dem colleague right now!" @RepLowenthal  -Rigell discusses g'mandering
The line that gets the most applause at our town hall: "Both parties in Washington are failing the American people right now."
Constituent says he agrees w most of Rigell's votes, disagrees w some.  Rigell says, "Same situation with my wife!"
In the audience today at our townhall: a Marine, a firefighter, former fighter pilot, mother of 6.  #safestplaceinvirginia.
Constituent asks Rigell to support legislation for term limits.  Boom.  Already done: https://t.co/nns2VNO61V
Rigell says he is going to find a way to talk about how gerrymandering is hurting the country - even if no one asks!
Term limits = YES.
Shipbuilder notes that #continuingresolutions are hurting his industry.  Rigell agrees, notes that they are hurting military, too.
Rigell: "I'm a strong supporter of 2nd amndt, own what people call 'assault weapons.' Must defend right of lawful citizens to own firearms."
Rigell discusses #benghazi, #IRS, #Syria, UnAffordable Care Act. "Must be degree of accountability in Administration; I'm fighting for that"
Woman makes a comment at townhall: "Washington is out of control."
"Debt ceiling is a good thing - causes us to talk about why we're borrowing." - Rigell at townhall. Watch live: http://t.co/UY8FAHgVgN
Next comment at townhall: "Gov shutdown was unacceptable." Rigell agrees, notes he was among first to call for clean CR to prevent shutdown.
First question at townhall: VA claim delays. Rigell: "Duty not being met with respect to caring for our veterans." Staffers on hand 2 help.
"I will not yield to the seductive call of apathy." -Rigell at Newport News townhall.
Rigell gives a shout out to @cspanwj while at our Newport News townhall.  "I like being on -- they give me more than 2 minutes to talk!"
Rigell at #NewportNews townhall with @13JanetRoach: "Political gridlock is unacceptable."
Rigell references Washington's farewell address: http://t.co/EaRHNLtusC
"Our best days are ahead of us.  I believe this with all of my heart." -Rigell at town hall.
"I am fully intent on changing the institution of Congress.  Daunting, but it can be done!" -Rigell at #newportnews town hall

My party needs to go to conference on budget to fix #sequester, end #furloughs.  We need to make decision to address our differences.
Working w @timkaine to advance bipartisan, bicameral alternative to navigate #sequester. Long term solution is 4 Congress to pass a #budget.
On @HearSayWHRV: Putting furlough "savings" in perspective: savings from furloughs are $2B. DOD budget is $600B.
In Apr I led bipartisan letter to #SECDEF asking him 2 give service chiefs latitude 2 navigate #Sequester w/o furloughs. He CHOSE not to.
Announced on @HearSayWHRV: I'm headed to Gulf Coast at the end of the month to see improvements made in offshore energy production &amp; safety.
