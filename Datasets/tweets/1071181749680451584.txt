@tmagasays Let's make a rebuttal. "Dear Left/Social/Commun-ists: The products available in this store are for sale, not donation. Please see Salvation Army for hand outs, loss prevention associates are armed and will respond with force to theft/vandalism. You've been warned."
@scrowder Was that supposed to be Lewis Black?
@MeatAnalog @saturnineba @MichaelBurbage @ByRosenberg That sucks.
@MeatAnalog @saturnineba @MichaelBurbage @ByRosenberg I absolutely agree local policies are making it harder for people to stay in/around the Seattle area. The move if you can't afford it theory is flawed because it supposes you have some way to move, other than that, it's pretty sound.
@MeatAnalog @saturnineba @MichaelBurbage @ByRosenberg Well in that case you should feel bad constantly because you're always taking a position that would be filled by someone else, whether less qualified or more qualified.
@MeatAnalog @saturnineba @MichaelBurbage @ByRosenberg You probably could live off of $17/hr. Probably being the key word, most people can, just not in their desired area. I don't think it's a societal failing I think its a natural evolution. Supply and demand will take effect, there is a shortage of labor, increasing value of labor
@MeatAnalog @saturnineba @MichaelBurbage @ByRosenberg I apologize then, it's hard to read emotion. Congratulations though, I'm glad you found somewhere better for you! :)
@PTStephen @ByRosenberg @TeachingAgent Rent does not go up for no reason, rent goes up because people make more money and are willing to pay more for housing... That's called inflation. If no one can afford the price rent rises to, the landlord will be forced to lower prices or not rent out their property.
@saturnineba @MichaelBurbage @ByRosenberg It's not ballsy to point out that if you can't afford to live somewhere you shouldn't live there... If they are his employees, what is he saying? I can find someone else to take your role. If 5000 jobs were not filled naturally wages will rise to incentivize those who r applying.
@MeatAnalog @saturnineba @MichaelBurbage @ByRosenberg If anything, assuming you're better off not being a professional cook, you should be celebrating your ability to recognize better opportunities. I once got a $.70 raise and was offended, so I found a place that valued me more.
@MeatAnalog @saturnineba @MichaelBurbage @ByRosenberg I don't know why you're upset, you're no longer a professional cook, I assume you left for better wages or benefits. Meaning you made yourself more valuable to the market, or took a position that offered a higher value to someone else. No one is forced you to stay, or leave.

@my2meows @RepJayapal That's not an argument, there is a reason. Can you tell me the reason? Because there are tens of thousands of regulations that are treated as law that are made up outside of the legislative branch, for whatever reason they want. Have you ever voted on an OSHA regulation?
@my2meows @RepJayapal Have you ever seen an OSHA book? MSHA book? FMCSA book? Half of the things in those books are complete nonsense.
@my2meows @RepJayapal I'm not exactly sure how you got deregulate Wall Street from deregulate industry... Tell me, how many pages of regulations were in OSHA and MSHA guidelines in 1990, 2000, and 2015. I'll concede if you find that business has been deregulated.
@my2meows @RepJayapal Because they don't have to, because there are enough people willing to work for the wages they offer, that's why people actually work there. It's called business. What's so difficult about this, if no one wanted to work for that wage they wouldn't have employees.

If cost of labor raises, cost of products raise. Your instigating inflation.
@my2meows @RepJayapal Yeah, no. Corporations have been lobbying to make it more expensive for smaller companies to be able to stay in business by introducing what seems like innocuous legislation, but really just adds on to the cost of business - pushing out the competition who can't absorb those $$.

@booooooosh @Ocasio2018 You can't seriously say that the whole system is racist because more of this race of people own more or less valuable property. There's more economic mobility in this country than any other the world has ever seen. This is an attempt to play the race card and create division.
@booooooosh @Ocasio2018 Ok, after reading your Google page I'll admit I jumped the gun on the term because I hadn't heard it before. Still funny as hell as far as I'm concerned. However, calling city zoning practices racist seems a little ridiculous. Money has more to do with neighborhood than race.
@booooooosh @Ocasio2018 The article didn't even refer to environmental justice... The whole idea behind the article was renewable energy ending racism. (Unless it continued after a dozen comments) Which, by the way, is completely ridiculous. So Tesla succeeds &amp; the civil rights act immediately follows?
@booooooosh @Ocasio2018 Totally :D
@booooooosh @Ocasio2018 Doesn't putting a subject before a blanket statement subtract from meaning? Like if I were to say 'my truth' isn't that kind of like saying 'what I think is true' which isn't necessarily truth? 	Regardless, it'd be pretty awesome to see EJWs behind SJWs cleaning up broken glass.

@claycane As for Colin, he had every right in the world to do what he did even if it did conflict with his contract (not saying it didn't). People were pissed about that because they didn't want to involve politics with sports. I didn't care because I'm more entertained by politics anyway.
@claycane Yeah he did resign on his own, and he did apologize (apparently) on his own. But the outrage over all of this is probably what this was all about, I didn't see him apologize and resign from anything else over the past seven plus years.
@jordanbpeterson Haha haha that's amazing.

@claycane Does it matter? People who stand up for free speech don't necessarily worship Trump, some of us don't even really like him. I wouldn't be so quick to act like you're burning Republicans with this, if anything you're proving that they are more bi*-partisan than you are being.
