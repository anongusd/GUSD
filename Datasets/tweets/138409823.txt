The problem is if you reward him now instead of a one off it becomes routine, Trump is not a reasonable person, its up to the people to hold him &amp; Republicans accountable, that's what Elections are for, hopefully the people that voted for him take their vote seriously next time. https://t.co/FuVAQKq9pU
