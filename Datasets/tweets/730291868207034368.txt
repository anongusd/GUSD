Happy Sunday folks. The Lord bless the new week and cause all you do to prosper.  Shalom!
Whatever words we utter should be chosen with care for people will hear them and be influenced by them for good or evil.
Everyday is a second chance. Today is brand new. Make this day count. With the help of God you can create new realities.
If you tell the truth, it becomes a part of your past. If you lie, it becomes a part of your future. Remember, let Truth define your future. It's a beautiful day.
Worry looks around, fear looks back, faith looks up, guilt looks down, but I look forward. Aspire,  move on.
True¬†friends say good things behind your back and bad things to your face.
Hurt¬†me with the truth. But never comfort me with a lie.
It's¬†not about who is real to your face, it's about who stays real behind your back.
Worrying¬†has never solved any problem but with prayers, faith, hope and love, we shall always conquer through¬†hard times.

Your mind is always absorbing something consciously or unconsciously. Renew your mind daily with God's word.
Meditation on the word of God creates prosperity in your soul, and when your soul prospers, everything else prospers.

A prosperous soul is free of anxiety, bitterness, offense, anger, doubt, wounding and negativity.
A prosperous soul is optimistic, positive and faith-filled - aligned with God's word.
When ur body is not in submission to ur born again spirit, it performs the deeds of the flesh. Your soul hosts ur mind, emotion and will.
When your body is in submission to ur born again spirit, you are enabled to perform the works of Jesus in the earth.
When ur soul prospers, u potentially prosper and experience good health. You attract to urself what ur soul thinks on with focus and belief.

When ur thoughts, focus and beliefs are in alignment with God's promises our soul prospers (3John2).

@patriciaking4jc I have been studying some of your books. Gods law of attraction stands out for me, because of biblical perspectives.
Your focus on God's goodness creates a realm of favour around your life that will follow you all your days.
Whatever you focus on, you empower. When you focus on the goodness of God, you will grow in favour with both God and mankind.
Meditation precedes believe. When you ponder on the promise, then it becomes your reality. Your reality is your belief.
People who believe they r rejected have a realm of rejection around them and attract more rejection.
When u establish core beliefs regarding d fav of God in ur life, then dat fav will attract more fav. It bcoms a realm &amp; atmosphere ard u.
There are three that testify: the spirit and the water (word) and the blood (covenant).
Everything in your life flows from your established beliefs within.
Faith is the connector that brings truth from the eternal realm into the time realm. Truth is based upon God's word.
There are two realms- the natural realm of time and the eternal realm. Facts are of the natural realm and  truth is of the eternal realm.
Faith gives us access to favour. Faith is when what you believe becomes an internal reality.
Please don't doubt the goodness of God. We are products of God's goodness and love. God is Love!
Favour ensures that your errors and mistakes are covered. It is the best insurance and assurance policy.
Favour is God's influence in my life. Favour factor gives me access to God's ability, and I can do all things thru Christ who dwells in me.
The favour factor eliminates curses in your life.
Blessing is to invoke favour upon someone and to empower to prosper.
Do you know that God has blessed you already. We are a blessed generation.
Favour in your life is not supposed to be short-lived, but a lifetime.
When favour is factored into your life's equation,  everything is a possibility and it is always a win-win situation.
To be favoured is to be given unfair advantage.
God's favour opens realms for benefits and gifts to be given to me.
Favour is a force. Once it is bestowed on you, it attracts goodness and mercy.
Favour is better than riches, it is the golden key that unlocks the gates of immeasurable blessings for me.
Favour is unbeatable. It contains the force for winning in all human endeavours.
Favour is irresistible. It brings uncommon opportunities your way, connects you with all kinds of destiny helpers.
Favour is unstoppable. It is a force that ensures you have surplus.
Favour is supernatural. It will do for you what you cannot do for yourself.
Favour brings us into the place of affluence.
Favour makes d difference in my life. Grace is undeserved favour. When u get wht u are not qualified for, then u know it is d grace of God.

See nothing but God.
Your miracle is in your mouth.
If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth. Ecclesiastes 11:3
To prophesy is to speak words of power &amp; revelation. So don't freak out when u hear d word prophecy or prophesying in d Christian circle.
If u are unhappy with ur life, you can change it. You can control ur destiny by d power of God made available to you thru prophecy.
When u prophesy, u are actually speaking with d ability of d spirit of God. And d Spirit of God is creative, able to change or make new.
We are all empowered to prophesy, that is speaking words of power able to affect our bodies, families, finances, academics, health etc.
Prophecy and promise are the same. The Bible is the book of prophecy and also the book of promise.
Your future or destiny is not in your hands but in your mouth. Its up to you to speak it into existence.
Prayer breeds idea. Let idea dominate ur thought &amp; affect ur confession. Let this idea become a strong desire, act d desire - MANIFESTATION
Reality is existential whether it is tangible or abstract.
Creation is done in ur spirit. As d word is spoken, it transforms ur imagination into reality. Reality may not be tangible, it means truth.
Negative talk is bad, they are like the cloud, when they are full they rain down. Speak faith filled words, their rain is a delight.
Give yourself a new name. Let your expectation be your new name. Abram (exalted father) was changed to Abraham (father of many).
A dream is a seed with sufficient energy in it for actualisation. Let your dream grow.
Paint d picture of what u want in ur mind, brood over it, allow d HolyGhost to vitalise it by d spoken word of God. It will surely manifest.
To be effective in creation, have one desire, concentrate on that one thing. Pray, visualise, affirm &amp; it will show.
Align ur imagination with d promise, visualise it  act as if it is done, and it shall be done. The consciousness of this reality is belief.
RT @JuliaGrantham2: Kind words can be short and easy to speak, but their echoes are truly endless.	St. Teresa of Calcutta https://t.co/r42F‚Ä¶
You cannot receive any promise if you don't believe. Annual prophecies can become a reality if we believe and put them to work.
Everything brings forth after its own kind. When good desire is conceived, it will naturally bring forth good things.
Have good desires, incubate them, speak it and enjoy d manifestation. The same principles hold for negative desires.
You will deliver what you have incubated inside, there is a set time for delivery.
Imagination distinguishes humans from other animals.
God has put in you His creative ability, your imaginative power is your creative ability.

Patience is natural to those who trust.
Giving out what you cherish the most is true generosity.
Generosity means giving away in order to keep.

Read 1 Cor. 6:19; John 15:4; 2 Cor. 5:1; 2 Cor. 4:7. I am a recipient and a receptacle of all that is divine. Am d conduit of manifestation.
The living God lives and function within the temple of my body. I am the carrier of divinity.
I am a faith-being, designed for receptivity of God's activity, availability to God's ability.
I am a vessel, a temple &amp; a house. I contain the presence of divinity. God's activity is manifested through my union and dependency on Him.

We have more degrees, but less sense. More knowledge, but less judgement: more experts but more problems. More medicine but less wellness.
We spend more, but have less; we buy more but enjoy less. We have bigger houses but smaller families. More conveniences but less time.

Your present situation is the result of the choice you made in the past.
Every action generates a force of energy that returns to us in like kind, what we sow is what we reap.
Be open to receive from others.
I have more than enough and I give freely. The more I give d more I receive, d more I receive d more I give. This is d dynamics of giving.
Always wish people well. Get truly happy and excited when good things happen to others, yours will manifest speedily.
Make a decision that any time you come into contact with someone you must give them something. Material thing or a prayer or a compliment.
The easiest way to get what you want is to help others get what they want.
In every seed is the promise of thousands of forests.
The universe operates through dynamic exchange, give then you receive.
All relationship is reflection of your relationship with yourself.

In order to change ur thoughts, you need to change ur words.
In order to change ur negative vibe to positive, change ur emotion. In order to change ur emotion, you need to change ur thoughts.
Am not sure Manchester United are serious contenders for the EPL title. Am not convinced they have the character.
Join with Christ in daily prayer and witness a 360 degree turn around in your life. You can only prosper, guaranteed.
Fight a good fight...Be ye angry... Neither give place to the devil...
In praise we vocalise who God is, while in thanksgiving we vocalise what God has specifically done to us.
For God to meet our need, we must define the need. Be specific, make your supplication boldly and God will answer.
Human wisdom and desire can achieve human result. But praying in the spirit produces divine results.
If u are God conscious, confidence can never be an issue in ur life. Have His presence consciousness and walk in victory 24/7.
Stay awake spiritually and be on the guard.
Read and meditate on Jeremiah 23:29. God's word is so powerful.
God's word gives life to our prayer.
The word of God is the actual substance for effective prayer.
Pray God's word.
The Bible is a most read, most believe and a most obey Book.
Bitterness towards others drain prayer power.
Read Psalm 51:10
There can be no healing within until there is confession without.
Read Psalm 66:18
Think no thought but the thought of God.
In silent waiting, focus only on the love nature of God.
Answer to prayer are most meaningful when they are thought of least.
Prayer is more meaningful when God is thought of most.
Be still and know that I am God.
Waiting is the elevation of the mind to God.
Our time of waiting in prayer can be termed wordless worship.
@TECNOMobileNG
To verbally pronounce the Lord Jehovah worthy of honour is the true meaning of 'Praise the Lord', a common clich√© in the Church.
To develop the "Praise-life" is to develop certain immunity to the enemy attack.
Praise is the antidote to Satanic oppression. Praise guarantees the absence of demonic operations at night.
@TIME
Transformation can only take place when the mind is renewed by the application of the word of God. Deliberate application of God's word.
Be definite in everything you do and never leave unfinished thoughts in the mind. Always conclude on all subjects.
Be careful on what you think about most of the time. Your dominant thought attracts. It becomes a reality. As man thinketh in his heart...
Never accept from life anything you do not want. Demand good from life always. Don't beg, demand. Be confident in your request.
Dislodge fear in your mind and replace it with faith. Be deliberate.
Budget your time so none of it is wasted.
Be willing to serve others, material things will follow later.
Bring out the good in every temporary defeat. Take time to analyse setbacks in your life. Do things differently afterwards.
Decide what you want in life, work towards it, be willing to sacrifice everything else.
Do your own thinking on all occasions. Be a thinker, ask questions.
Every adversity brings with it the seed of an equivalent advantage.
Whatever man believes to be true has a way of becoming true.
Faith is the beginning of all great achievements.
Be careful what you set your heart upon, for it surely shall be yours.
I used to go to prayer only when facing difficulty. Now I go to prayer before difficulty overtake me.
Prayer is an act that is fearless, any act of prayer tinged no matter how remotely with fear or doubt is simply exercise in futility.
Failure and temporary defeat are part of the journey to finding true success.
Don't allow temporary defeats turn to permanent failures move on.
Don't be your own worst enemy.
Your only limitation is the one which you set up in your own mind.
Act immediately when faith and courage speaks.
Keep doubt and fear and worry, and all thoughts of limitation, entirely our of your mind.
Will you be guided by faith? Or will you allow fear to overtake you?
Today I have the honour to preach at the IPC Jos children's day. I feel so blessed.
With much talk there is no doing.
Shift to thoughts that empower you.
Avoid all thoughts that weaken you.
Trust your divinity.
Treat yourself as if you are already what you want to become.
You can't solve a problem with the mind that created it.
Give up your personal story.
Embrace silence.
Don't die with your music still in you.
Let God and let Love lead.
Stop the blame game, take responsibility for your action.
Resentment about anything or anyone, will lead to your destruction.
There are no justification for resentments.
You can't give away what you don't have.
Have a mind that is opened to everything and attached to nothing.

Don't glorify the devil with your confession. Negative confession glorifies the devil.
There is no faith without confession.
The great tragedy of the average man is that he goes to the grave with his music still in him. - Longfellow
How do you eat an elephant? A bite at a time. To be the best in your chosen field is one step at a time.
To have more, you must first be more - Johann Wolfgang
To achieve something that you have never achieved before, you must become someone that you have never been before - Les Brown
Like and respect yourself. Then it will be easy for you to love and respect others.
Set high standards for yourself.
Love and accept everything about your make up and what others feel about you will not matter.
To be successful, you must double your rate of failure.
Fear of rejection and criticism, limits our expression.
You are born unafraid. You learn fear. If fear is learned, then it can be unlearned.
Whatever thought seed you plant will grow. Chose your thought.
Don't feel it, act it.
Fake it until you make it
Act as if it has happened or you have owned it or you have received it...
Choose your thoughts. Sow better seeds.
Change your thinking, change your life.
Whatever you believe with conviction becomes your reality.
Your thoughts can make you powerful or powerless, a success or a failure.
You become what you think about most of the time.
There is no one like you in the history of mankind.

Biology: The concept of a living God creating life fits the evidence better than spontaneous generation and macroevolution.
Don't judge or condemn.
Meditate on this scripture: No evil shall befall you, nor shall any plague come near your dwelling (Psalm 91:10, NKJV).
Let God's will be done. Let your will be that God's will be done on your life.
All monies should be sent forth fearlessly and with a blessing.
Give your tithe with love and cheerfulness.
Giving opens the way for deceiving. In order to create activity in your finances, give.
There is nothing too great of accomplishment for the man who knows the power of his word, and  follows the leading of the Holy Spirit.
No man is your enemy, no man is your friend, every man is your teacher.
You can only overcome fear by doing the things you are afraid of
Fear is a misdirected energy and must be redirected , or transmuted into faith.
Doubt and fear poison the mind and body and imagination runs riot, attracting disaster and disease.
Life is a mirror, and we find ourselves reflected in our associates.
Bless your enemy, and you rob him of his ammunition. His arrows will be transmuted into blessings.
Nothing on earth can resist an absolutely nonresistant person.
Unforgiveness is d most prolific cause of disease. It will harden arteries or liver, &amp; affect the eye sight. In its train are endless ills.
False growths are caused by jealousy, hatred, unforgiveness, fear etc.
Critical, inharmonious thought cause unnatural deposits in the blood which settle in the joints.
Continual criticism causes rheumatism.
Don't give your dominant attention to what is wrong. Dwell on what is right.
Worrying is the feeling of negative emotion. You can decide to dwell on the negative emotions or you can change it. Its actually ur choice.
What you choose will reproduce itself in your life. Choose blessing, joy, good health, peace, prosperity, abundance, love and goodwill.
Every event in our life is an activity of energy we have created.
Living your life as a victim robs you of living the creative and vibrant life.
You eliminate worry by creating something new in the now. Let go of the past.
Sound, light, matter, emotions, thoughts are all vibratory energy. They can change or create our realities.
Quantum physics has shown that matter is a certain vibratory wave of energy. Matter is attracted to other matter.
Every thought is a vibratory frequency.
You attract whatever you focus on. Concentrated sun rays through the window of focus produces energy.
As within so is without. If you are happy inside, it shows outside.
We invite most of the things we experience in life. Wrong thinking, wrong confession. As a man thinketh in his heart, so he externalises.
Man was born to suffer was a song we unwittingly accepted and soaked into our subconscious.
We have been conditioned right from an early age to view worry and struggles as life's normal.
In order to live the life you desire you must eliminate doubt, fear and worry. Don't be anxious about anything. Have hope, faith and love
Fear and worry have the power to bring everything you don't want in your life.
It is possible to eliminate all your worries.
Introduce faith-energised high frequency words to your children, finances, car and health.
All things respond to the vibration of energy.
Everything has a frequency of vibration.
Matter is not solid. When closely observed we will see atoms moving. These atom vibrate at different frequency.
All things (matter) are made of atoms, including your children, cars, computer. Your house.
Things or matter obey words. Words are vibrational energy.
Things always work out for me. Everything I do prospers and I have abundance in Jesus name.
Words are vibrations of energy that affect the atoms that make up the matter you speak to.
Words are energy and energy affects matter.
The substance from which our world is made is influenced and manifested by words.
Your thoughts and beliefs produce an energy that people perceive and react to.
When you are angry, things go wrong.
Beliefs produce energy.
Visualisation helps you bridge the gap of time and space.
Know what you want, then step aside to see it manifest. Don't be concerned about the when &amp; how it will be delivered. It will surely come.
Know that there will be manifestation, just as you are sure your Konga order will be delivered at your door step.
When you have cast your intention don't keep checking to see whether it has manifested.
God is not limited by time and space.
Negative and fear thoughts cancel out the manifestation of our original positive intentions.
You nullify your intention and manifestation of the desired, when you ask the question of when and how will it happen.
Time buffer before physical manifestation.
God's time is the best.
The Universe orchestrates everything in divine timing.
Time is an elusion. I know where time comes from. I can make more time when I need it.
Don't view time as a burden, but as an empowering concept.
What we have is NOW.
Time can only move forward and not backward.
Time is perceptual in nature. It is fast or slow. But time is the same, it is finite.
Time and space do not matter to the universe. You can change your reality by changing your thoughts or intentions.
Reject beliefs that would not serve your purpose.
Have an intention of abundance and the universe responds immediately.
Your body responds to your intentions. Have a peaceful intention and your body responds with the warmth of peace etc.
Handle your natural feelings of uncertainty and anxiety well, it affects  the manifestation of the things you desire.
Spiritual or metaphysical truth cannot be understood through intellectual reasoning.
Have a child like trust as you await the manifestation of what you desire.
If you don't contradict your intention and desire, it will manifest.
The universe picks on d sum total of ur intentions. So be careful what you think or desire. Even ur words are a factor of ur deep thoughts.
There is a time buffer before manifestation. So you can change negative manifestation by thinking positively.
The law of attraction talks about attracting different thought forms. Positive thoughts will attract other positive thoughts.
Control the thoughts that run through your mind.
Get rid of worrying and negative thoughts. You life will be shaped in there design or pattern.
Life respects your decisions and choices as you will allow it to be.
Life is as simple and easy as you allow it to be.
You become what you think about.
Position yourself in a state of nonresistance. Focus on what you strongly desire and it will manifest.
Time-space reality, what does it really mean?
Everything you need is within you.
We judge reality on the basis of whether something physical is happening.
When nothing seems to be happening that is when everything is happening.
We are mostly attached to our physical realities.
Allow your consciousness move at the same level with the answer you seek.
Consciousness is our mind, the state of our inner being.

Lessons from the sermon  - work is a gift from God.
Excited to be at our son's primary school graduation today at Hill Christian Academy in Maitama, Abuja.
When you surrender yourself to God, then you must allow Him to work in you. You become a vessel meet for the Master's use.
Continually surrender and trust God.
Sanctification is both a step of faith and a process of works.
You can't do it by yourself, only God can do it.
Man is to trust God to work all things out.
Your current internal dialogue creates your now and your future.
The point of power is in the present moment.
Your experiences match your innermost beliefs.
Love yourself. Be gentle and kind.
Whatever you choose to think about your life and yourself, becomes true for you.
All illness is self created.
Every cell in our body respond to every word we speak and every thought that runs through our mind.
The body is a mirror of our inner thoughts and beliefs.
Your mental patterns contribute to ease and disease in your body.
Your mental patterns are constantly creating your own life experiences.
Be gentle and less critical of yourself.
Resentment eats your body. Resolve it. Forget about the past.
Guilt is a totally useless emotion.
Guilt always look for punishment and create pain.
@realDonaldTrump Happy independence United States of America. God bless and keep you Sir!
Great peace is found amongst people engrossed in libraries or laboratories.
Get busy and you wouldn't have time for worry.
Those who do not know how to fight worry die young.
Man is the cause of his problems.
@iamifechuks @CopelandNetwork because faith comes by hearing God's word.
Do not be intimidated by your enemies.
You are connected to the people you talk about.
Belief becomes part of the field.
Placebo effect results in healing due to positive thinking. Negative thinking creates the nocebo effect, no healing.
The central voice is the mind.
When cells are in a community they give up their intelligence and respond to the central voice.
You are a community of cells.
Belief creates biology. What you believe creates your life.
Perception can rewrite the genetic code.
If someone tells you can have a disease and you believe that then you create the disease.
If you change your perceptions you change the reading of your genes.
Environmental signal, regulatory protein, DNA, RNA, protein. Primacy of environment.
Now we talk about the environment dogma and not the DNA dogma.
95% of cancer are not as a result of mutant genes but due to epigenetic control.
If you look for a disease you can create the disease through epigenetics.
Epigenesis can cover mutant genes and healthy individual are born.
One gene under epigenetic control (perception) can make over 30k different proteins.
Epigenetics is a new field that explains what controls the genes.
The gene is read or not read.
You control genes and genes do not control you.
Now questions are being asked on the functions of the proteins in the chromosomes.
For many years our attention has been  on been on the DNA in the chromosomes and not the proteins.
In the nucleus are chromosomes (unit of heredity). The chromosomes are made of 50% DNA and 50% proteins.
The question then is are the blue prints read or not? And what is responsible for that process?
Genes provide the blueprint for protein production. So genes cannot be turned on or off as we are taught. They don't control that process.
Perception control behaviour.
The brain of the cell is the membrane. In embryology the ectoderm gives rise to the skin and the central nervous system.
Causes of illness are basically trauma, toxins and thought (mind).
Bad signal or protein cause disease
Proteins respond to good and bad vibes.
Where proteins change shape they change behaviour.
Movement is where life comes from
We age because we collectively believe in aging. But we can  live ever young, it all depends on our minds.
In an experiment using multi potential stem cells, different environment determine the kind of organ produced by the stem cells.
The mind controls the cell in our body.
We all have stem cells in our body. Stem cells can replace every tissue or organ in our body.
The secret of life can be learned from the stem cells.
Genes do not control biology.
This then means that genes are not responsible for d production of proteins. This is highly controversial and debatable in d science world
The logic then is that 150k genes will make150k proteins.  But in the human  genome project only 23k genes were found.
Science tells us that there are 150k proteins that make up the human body. A gene is responsible for the production of a protein.
The nucleus is not the brain but the gonad.
Every function in your body is also present in the cell. The cells are made up of organelles.
When you remove the nucleus the cell cannot reproduce itself.
So enucleation is not removing the brain. This then means that brain is not the same as nucleus as earlier believed.
Remove nucleus from the cell and the cell lives and its behaviour is unaffected.
Remove brain from an organism and the organism dies.
The textbook tell us that the nucleus of a cell is equal to the brain of the organism.
The human body contains about 70 trillion volts of energy, using the Chi technique we can use the energy within to heal our body.
We are interacting waves and not just individuals (quantum physics).
Newtonian physics focus on matter only. Quantum physics states that there is a relationship between matter and energy.
The mind is energy.
Quantum physics explains that humans are not just matter, but waves or energy. That is why someone's presence can affect u +vely or -vely.
Without the magnetic field (mind) particles will have no shape or structure.
Mind is the field that gives shape to the body.
The field is the sole governing agency of matter -  Albert Einstein
Man is a huge bundle of electricity.
1.4 volts per cell multiply by 50 trillion cells in the human body is 70 trillion volts of electricity.
Every cell has 1.4 volts
Every cell in your body has a negative charge inside and positive on the outside.
All atoms give off energy and all atoms absorb energy.
Matter plus field equal structure.
Scanning machines pick vibrations from cells in our body. Normal cells emit different vibes from sick or abnormal ones.
You are energy waves.
We are made out of atoms and molecules. Then it means we are giving and absorbing energy at different vibration frequencies.
Every atom or molecule emit and absorb light of characteristic wavelengths.
Don't talk about the particles, talk about the fields and the waves.
We are connected to everything through the waves (vibration) we generate. It may be constructive or destructive.
The waves can be constructive or destructive interference when energy fields meet.
Quantum physics study the vibration or waves and not the atoms. Waves create fields. There is a field of energy.
Vibrations can alter our functions and biology. Proteins determine our structures and functions.
A new thinking states that vibration can change the protein of the body. And not genes.
All animals and plants communicate by vibration. And they know if they are  in a good or bad place by the vibration.
Constructive interference is called good vibe.
Destructive (energy) interference cancel out one another. While constructive interference add up and harmonise.
The constructive interference of energy.
The study of disease goes beyond the state of matter. It should be wholistic.
The Newtonian physics states that the Universe equals matter.
A change in mathematical interpretations will change all scientific inferences.
The first floor of science is mathematics, then physics, chemistry, biology and psychology.
The number cause of death are drugs used in the treatment of disease (iatrogenic causes).
The medical model states that you are a biochemical machine controlled by genes. Our make up proteins are controlled by genes.
The Central Dogma is the same as the primacy of DNA. Primacy means first cause, the DNA is the first cause.
Dogma is a believe based on religious persuasion and not scientific fact.
Central Dogma - DNA-RNA-Protein, the DNA determine the protein.
The proteins provide for your physical structures and functions.
150,000 different  proteins make up the human body.
The invisible world is perfect, but the visible world is not.
When you have a good government (brain) that control and regulates the activities of the 50 trillion cells, then you have good health.
Your mind is the government of the 50 trillion cells.
Our body is made up of about 50 trillion cells. You are a community and not a single person.
Our bodies have the potential of healing itself.
Get knowledge, but most importantly make use of the knowledge acquired.

Miracles reflect the law of eternity, not of time.
Miracles arise from conviction, without which they deteriorate into magic. Magic is mindless and destructive.
Miracles undo the past in the present, and thus release the future.
Everything that comes from love is a miracle.
Be glad you are yourself.
I attract the things I think, visualise and talk about.
I have unlimited power at my disposal.
You will only be successful doing what you like.
There are staggering opportunities and abundance in the universe.
Give attention to the thoughts flowing through your mind and direct them adequately.
Trust God
Give yourself good quality time and honour yourself.
Work hard and smart.
Your thoughts influence your reality.
Loose your temper in any situation and you loose your power of control.
Blessing and goodwill, the two most potent weapons against your enemies.

Congratulations Manchester United!!
Doubt and fear poison the mind.
Our commitment of trust with Divinity is in standing still and seeing God work and battle on our behalf.
Don't exert your will on others
You attract what you fear
Our desires must be divinely guided
Ask aright
Hold thoughts of good and good will come. Hold thoughts of sickness and you will fall sick. Hold thoughts of success and success will come
Love and goodwill destroys the enemy.
Bless and don't curse
Every disease is caused by a mind not at ease.
You attract whatever you voice out.
No man can fail if someone sees him successful. Always seek for help. You are not alone. You have God. He is the Higher power. Connect.
Control yourself and you can control anything. When you lose control you lose power. Lack of control is lack of power.
Before you call, God will answer.
Prepare for the thing you have asked for. There is a supply with every demand. God is our Source of supply. He is kind and faithful.
You are divinely protected and God is never too late.
Confront your fear.
There is a divine design for each person, where only you fit. You are unique and special. Find your purpose.
Whatsoever a man sow in words or deed will come back to him. Be careful what you say or do. The natural law of cause and effect.
