@SusanCogdill2 @greta Nope still trying to figure out why anyone would follow your dumbass
@SusanCogdill2 @greta Conversation is over and you've lost
@SusanCogdill2 @benshwind @greta Why don't you become a cop so you can show everyone the correct way to police.  Change the world that way. How bout that?
@SusanCogdill2 @benshwind @greta I don't think I threatened anyone. I'm not a cop that's just simple logic.  Police have a tough job and want to go back home to their family
@SusanCogdill2 @benshwind @greta I wasn't referring to 'Frump' specifically, twerp.
@SusanCogdill2 @benshwind @greta Yah knock yourself out, but don't come crying to me when someone like you loses their life because they disagree with me and agree with you!
@SusanCogdill2 @greta So your some grand lawyer now? You really have no fucking clue but I do. Stay safe and listen to the police to keep the situation non lethal
@SusanCogdill2 @benshwind @greta I like how you libs force us to properly say President Obama but then can call another wtfe slanderous thing that pops in your head #GetReal
@benshwind @SusanCogdill2 @greta I didn't say it was legal. I said do what police say. Courtrooms will hash out the details later. Too many social justice warriors out there
@Realalexwubbels you put lives in danger including the patient by not complying with the officer. Draw then fight for patient in court.
@benshwind @SusanCogdill2 @greta Taking a blood sample  = no harm. Defy police if you want but I'll continue to listen so I'm not shot!  Their job is too complicated #Comply
@SusanCogdill2 @greta It's not her call to not take a blood sample and break a law by disobeying.  If the sample was found to be illegal then tossed out in court.
