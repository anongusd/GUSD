If a government can't take a slice of everyone's income and spending and so forth, it probably can't do much else. A nice demonstration of a government's general competence and power.
My theory about taxes is slightly different than the MMT line (which states that they're used to drive demand for a currency and suppress demand/inflation).		That's true, but tax collection is also a state's "proof of work" a demonstration that a government controls its territory

@cullenroche @StephanieKelton This is not a troll, but outside of the Volcker experience, is there much evidence that traditional monetary policy "works" to contain inflation?
Here's a question about QE: One theoretical transmission mechanism was that it pushed people out of risk-free assets, and into risky assets. But since it swapped USTs for reserves at the Fed (a closed system) how did that money actually go into riskier assets?

@jbarro @LHSummers @BetseyStevenson This is why I specifically prefaced the question of what MMT people believe the answer to be. 		Because of course there are other possibilities, but I'm trying to keep the question narrow in order to get a specific perception.
This is the key lesson from the latest round of retail earnings. The companies tied to shopping malls are getting clobbered. The stores that aren't are doing fine. https://t.co/lZvK0NnqGQ

@MattBruenig @NoFuncDemo @DougHenwood @EnriqueDiazAlva Sure.
@MattBruenig @NoFuncDemo @DougHenwood @EnriqueDiazAlva Ok
@MattBruenig @NoFuncDemo @DougHenwood @EnriqueDiazAlva I think the problem is that as long as we talk about government budgets as being "funded" by taxes, then from a political perspective it's hard to change the conversation and make people less scared of deficits. So the rhetorical specificity serves a policy aim.
@MattBruenig @NoFuncDemo @DougHenwood @EnriqueDiazAlva Sure that's fine. But I'm still having trouble discerning your point, such originally was about why it's crazy to think of Treasuries as being money or money-like, and I still don't get why that is.
@MattBruenig @NoFuncDemo @DougHenwood @EnriqueDiazAlva That sounds fine to me
@MattBruenig @NoFuncDemo @DougHenwood @EnriqueDiazAlva I thought people were putting thousands of words around the latter already, emphasizing the point (or attempting to) that there's no such thing as implementing MMT but that it's a description of how things are currently
@MattBruenig @NoFuncDemo @DougHenwood @EnriqueDiazAlva Idk. I guess? Still not sure what you're driving at
@MattBruenig @DougHenwood @EnriqueDiazAlva I'd like to follow up on this point. What are we accomplishing in our understanding of the economy by drawing a bright distinction between cash and Treasuries?
@MattBruenig @NoFuncDemo @DougHenwood @EnriqueDiazAlva I guess depends on how it's written. If it required that taxes and spending equal out, then it would lead to bad policy
@MattBruenig @NoFuncDemo @DougHenwood @EnriqueDiazAlva How?
@MattBruenig @DougHenwood @EnriqueDiazAlva Ok what's your point
@DougHenwood @MattBruenig @EnriqueDiazAlva Doug I'm curious if you think capitalism exists in Japan and Germany. Also curious if you're conflating policy interest rates with private credit market rates.
@MattBruenig @DougHenwood @EnriqueDiazAlva If the yield in Treasuries were zero across the curve, as some people propose, then nobody would be sending money to the Treasury in exchange for bonds.
@MattBruenig @DougHenwood @EnriqueDiazAlva The first is just taxes, right?
@DougHenwood @MattBruenig @EnriqueDiazAlva Of course. See Japan or Germany. Now it's important to distinguish a policy rate from the rate of interest on private credit
@MattBruenig @DougHenwood @EnriqueDiazAlva Do rich people get Treasuries for free? Don't they have to buy them?
@MattBruenig @DougHenwood @EnriqueDiazAlva Who, in your mind, is getting Treasuries for free?
@MattBruenig @DougHenwood @EnriqueDiazAlva Well you have to buy them with other money, so it's just a swap.
@MattBruenig @DougHenwood @EnriqueDiazAlva I think this is why MMTers propose keeping rates at zero.
@MayankSeksaria @EnriqueDiazAlva @DougHenwood I guess. But I don't think it's controversial to say that euros are money
@MattBruenig @DougHenwood @EnriqueDiazAlva What do we accomplish analytically be dividing them?
@MayankSeksaria @EnriqueDiazAlva @DougHenwood Really? That seems very contrived
@MattBruenig @DougHenwood @EnriqueDiazAlva I'm actually curious what you think makes them so different.
@MattBruenig @DougHenwood @EnriqueDiazAlva Well. A person with $1 million in a bank account and $1 million in Treasuries in a brokerage account may be in a sightly different position, but they're not that different. So is it really that crazy to lump them together?
@MattBruenig @DougHenwood @EnriqueDiazAlva Great! So what's your definition
@MattBruenig @DougHenwood @EnriqueDiazAlva Do you have a definition of money?
@MattBruenig @DougHenwood @EnriqueDiazAlva I think there's a spectrum of what constitutes money. And so VTI has some characteristics of moneyness (liquidity, divisibility) but it's weaker on stability, and it's definitely not a unit it account.
@MattBruenig @DougHenwood @EnriqueDiazAlva Probably not. But I'm curious how Euros or gold fit into doug's definition.
@DougHenwood @MattBruenig @EnriqueDiazAlva Are euros and gold money?
@MayankSeksaria @EnriqueDiazAlva @DougHenwood I'm curious is Doug thinks gold or euros are money, since Con Edison won't take either.
@MayankSeksaria @EnriqueDiazAlva @DougHenwood I'd say no. But it is a store of value.
@EnriqueDiazAlva @DougHenwood They're probably too volatile. But on the other hand, there's tens of thousands of people who have eagerly taken a major part of their salary in Facebook shares. And there are instances of people selling their homes for other people's Facebook shares. So maybe not the far off.
@EnriqueDiazAlva @DougHenwood Sure. But even that isn't a very clearly defined term.
@DougHenwood @EnriqueDiazAlva But it'd be easy to pledge your t-bond as collateral to get cash. So it's close
@DougHenwood @EnriqueDiazAlva I'd consider land and gold (and maybe art) to be stores of value. Fluctuations in price are just one criteria.
@EnriqueDiazAlva @DougHenwood I agree it's a spectrum. But I don't think there's a bright line difference.
@DougHenwood @EnriqueDiazAlva A t-bond would definitely be considered the last one
@DougHenwood @EnriqueDiazAlva Right. I think people viewed money market funds as not possessing credit risk. The breaking of the buck showed that to be a lie. But that's different than saying money musnt fluctuate.
@DougHenwood @EnriqueDiazAlva What is money then, if it can't ever fluctuate in value?

@byrneseyeview @teasri That doesn't seem too horrible, since spending should incent more business investment
@teasri My middleground squish view is that monetary policy probably can deliver robust investment by creating stock market bubbles that spur investors to create companies that they can flip onto public markets. 		Though that doesn't seem like a great way to conduct policy, by and large.

Of course, the overwhelming number of people in finance are not MMT sympathetic (and in fact when you read sell-side analyst notes that mention it, it's always mentioned as a policy risk that future politicians might increasingly embrace it).
One critique of MMT is that it's suspect since many of its fans have finance backgrounds.		I get that. But since MMT's logical sequencing places a high emphasis the accurate characterization of monetary operations, I think it makes sense that it clicks with many finance types.

@Ramanan_V @rohangrey @IrvingSwisher But when you look at politics as it is, do you see much of that? Do you see Trump cronies drawing inspiration from MMT? Do you see AOC (who somewhat identifies as an MMTer) or Bernie (for whom Kelton worked) advocating lower taxes on the rich?
@Ramanan_V @rohangrey @IrvingSwisher You can argue with that tactic, but I think it's been an effective approach. Because without clearing up what they see as some basic misconceptions, the left (Democrats) end up playing defense or shooting themselves in the foot rhetorically and operationally (paygo)
@Ramanan_V @rohangrey @IrvingSwisher I think in general, folks like Kelton and Wray are making very narrow points about monetary operations on the belief that when people see how their basic understanding of things is wrong, then they'll be much more comfortable with aggressive, expansionary fiscal policy.
@Ramanan_V @rohangrey @IrvingSwisher I read Kelton's piece more narrowly, and that it's a morality tale about the wealthy having pushed deficit phobia for so long.

@Ramanan_V @rohangrey @IrvingSwisher Dean Baker, who is not an MMTer, had a similar view https://t.co/cfFAUUPWu8
@Ramanan_V @rohangrey @IrvingSwisher Is that really about lowering taxes or is it about a more efficient of system of taxation based on tax incidence.
@Ramanan_V @rohangrey @IrvingSwisher I think yours is a fine view to have. But within the context here, I see why Wray would hope that the new MMT wunderkind in DC would user her perch to articulate more clearly one of the movement's key premises.

@naufalsanaullah @MayankSeksaria @teasri I definitely don't think it's binary. There's also probably a cyclical element, that's not about ideas or generations but just about a confidence borne from a 10-year expansion.
It's nice to think that people pushing back against deficit fear-mongoring have changed some minds. But maybe millennials are just tired of being nailed to a cross of 2% inflation, and they have the numbers (and increasingly the representation in DC) to do something about it.

@rohangrey @MattBruenig @AlanMCole Well put
@MattBruenig @AlanMCole Even still, doesn't this presume some homogenous marginal propensity to consume? That raising X amount of dollars will free up the same amount of real resources regardless of where and how the tax is levied?
RT @conorsen: @vixcontango @TheStalwart MMT isn't a tool, it's a way of describing spending/budget/inflation realities as they exist today.
@conorsen Right. There may be good reasons to tax yachts more and to raise taxes on high earners. But freeing up real resources isn't the likely reason.
Unless the taxes somehow free up the real resources that would go to the new endeavor, then they won't get you very far in maintaining stable prices.
The conventional view would be that as long as the dollar amounts raised from taxes roughly equal the new spending, then that would suffice to contain inflation. But the MMT claim (taxes don't fund spending) points to why this is a problematic assumption.
But if the government undertakes a major new spending endeavor (say, expanding childcare), then taxing some totally unrelated areas (yachts, plane travel, etc) won't do anything to combat inflation, even if the dollar amounts were to match up.
This piece by @MattBruenig makes the same error that @jbarro made in his critique of, which is the assertion that since MMT prescribes higher taxes as a possible way to combat inflation, that it just gets you back to the classical view of taxes as a means of funding spending... https://t.co/o3k3iu4zFw

@NeerajKA Do you actually think CBD does anything?
It basically started all going to pot when Powell started talking about long way away from neutral, and it started to turn around when the Fed walked that back. And that's been mostly it. Hardly anything else has changed during this time.
There have been a lot of narratives that attempt to explain the market over the last several months -- trade, White House dysfunction, China weakness, political shifts, etc. -- but really the only thing that's had any real explanatory power is the Fed's shifts.

There's always risk. You just have to pick your poison in terms of what kind or risk you want to take for your circumstances. 		An entity like Wikileaks will take volatility risk in exchange for freedom to transact.		An international wire transfer company may choose the opposie.
A JPM Coin (or any other custodially backed fiat stablecoin) eliminates the volatility risk, but then that gets transfigured into counterparty risk (how much do you trust JPM?) and regulatory risk (will JPM's regulators clamp down on what you can use the coin).
Of course it's the same with Bitcoin or any others. The risk doesn't just disappear. It's just moved to somewhere else. Ultimately there's no free lunch and there's a kind of "Law Of Conservation Of Risk" that means you can't really eliminate it, you just transfer it elsewhere

@RayRedacted I just mean, the digital coin market is so idiosyncratic, even coins getting 51% attacked sometimes don't go down, therefore you can't read into one day's price action from news.
@RayRedacted That's not my point at all.
So basically I wouldn't read in anything at all to today's (lack of) price action.
Also, Ripple Inc. owns tons of the coins, and is always selling them. So they could always (in theory) slow down their daily pace of sales to keep the price stability.
Like for example, there have been days when a coin gets 51% attacked, and it doesn't even fall.		Most coins are pure beta. They all go up at the same time or all go down. Very little differentiation or response to the news in this market.
I've seen some people wonder why it is that Ripple hasn't plunged more on this JPM thing, if it's such a threat.  Well, for one thing, this market is so nascent, I almost never see coins trading on individual "fundamentals" https://t.co/yzZFSqB61B

@BrettArends Are you saying I should just follow what everyone else is into at the same time as everyone else?
So thinking back to Ripple, which is targeting regulated institutional customers on the premise that transfer via coin is faster than existing systems.		But why wouldn't those institutions prefer a fiat-backed stablecoin from JPM. What advantage does a decentralized system offer?
With cryptocurrencies, the idea is to move value from Person A to Person B in some decentralized manner, such that there's no Person C who can block it		With Stablecoins, it's about centralized transfer and the ability to place rules and conditions on how coins are spent.
@fakeryanmills Yes, they did.
@IvanTheK That's true, but A) Presumably anyone can examine the source code and B) you'd have a regulatory backstop, guaranteeing that JPM actually does have the fiat dollars in order to redeem JPM coin.
@IvanTheK What do you mean?
The key to thinking about Stablecoins (whether retail focused or institutional) is to not think of them as being in competition with "cryptocurrencies" at all. Entirely different purpose and premise.
@IvanTheK Yeah I think that sounds right
@IvanTheK Yeah, the coins are backed dollar for dollar https://t.co/g0mxe5J1iG
As someone argued it to me via email, you can think of these bankcoins as form of short-term credit, while the underlying transaction goes through the settlement process. Parties transfer the coins instantly and then destroy them once the money actually goes through.
@IvanTheK Well there's no credit quality with Ripple, because the currency isn't backed by anything and so it's exposed to major volatility risk.
Think about it, let's say you were in the business of transferring money, why would you take on the exchange rate volatility risk associated with having Ripple as a bridge currency, when you could have a fiat-coin backed by JPMorgan. No brainer.
If it turns out that the Blockchain/Coin framework turns out to be a good one for banks  transferring money around, then the JPM Coin should absolutely obliterate Ripple

@evankaloudis I didn't say anyone should embrace Bitcoin. I explained why some people do.
@evankaloudis You're not even presenting an argument. What's your case for that?
@jacoxnet Agreed
@CantHardyWait For state money? Maybe. But IMO Bitcoin doesn't need to be the official dominant money to work. So I don't consider that a problem.
@Lebrazos No don't think I have
@Ramanan_V Agree. And the same is true for gold. But I think, basically the volatility and security costs are the price the user pays for the freedom to transact.
Hi Houston https://t.co/n5XZYiQHif
And if you strip away all the Austrian rhetoric - which IMO is not at all essential to the case for the existence of digital cash - then there's nothing inconsistent at all between Bitcoin and a Keynesian worldview.
So while the shortcomings of the currency are easy to point out, and the arguments of many True Believers are easily debunked, there's still a strong case for why people value it and promote it that's not inconsistent with the priors of "normal" people.
This last part is why evangelism is part and parcel to Bitcoin's culture. The meme isn't going to propagate itself. People need to bang the drum. And anytime there's something totally new, the first people who will be open to it will be the cranks and the crazies.
Because to create cash requires a difficult problem for computers (which tend to be good at destroying data scarcity, not enforcing it) and it also requires a cultural solution so that people coalesce around something neutral as a medium of exchange.
And if you do think that cash is an important component of a free society, then you should answer what's a superior way to get there. Because it's obviously a very difficult problem.
So the first thing people should ask themselves is whether they can understand why some people might want private money (cash) and then secondly they should ask whether they think a world in which private transactions simply cease to exist is desirable.
Examples of people who might want to use cash include political dissidents, drug dealers, sex workers, free speech zealouts, enemies of oppressive state regimes and so on.
Now most people probably don't have much use for cash tbh, but it should be obvious that there's all kinds of people who would like money that has this property to it...
And by cash, I mean something with a very specific property: money that Person A can hand off to Person B without Person C telling them they're not allowed.
But if you can look past all this (and I know that's asking a lot) at its core, Bitcoin is attempting to introduce the concept of cash to the digital realm...
I think most Keynesian types see Bitcoin as a horribly inefficient medium of exchange, whose loudest advocates include many scammers, charlatans, misanthropes, and Austrian economics adherents. And tbh, this is basically all true...
Ok. I might get interrupted doing this and have to take a break midway, but I'll start...
Should I do a tweetstorm on what I think mainstream Keynesians like @paulkrugman @Nouriel and @ObsoleteDogma get wrong about Bitcoin?
@dsquareddigest Yeah

And of course, one can disagree with this claim and say it's not how government spending works. But nonetheless, there's no such thing as "implementing MMT" or "financing with MMT" or anything else like that.

@profplum99 @modestproposal1 Nonetheless, the article stated that due to massive issuance, the government would have to engage in financial repression/stealth default to avoid an actual default.

@aaronlammer @MartyBent Yeah, that concepts is nonsense
Is it just me, or is it incredibly common after bank earnings for them to flip from red to green or green to red intraday.		It seems like the initial interpretation of the earnings gets re-assessed and flipped with banks in a way that doesn't happen with other industries.
Imagine passing some weird law that said everybody had to spend one week a month as a substitute teacher or as a barber. That would create all kinds of havoc in the economy and major constraints on real resources and so on without any new government spending.
But it's pretty easy to imagine inflationary policies that don't boost the deficit very much (just demand people do something very ineffecient).		And it's easy to imagine revenue raising policies that don't ease real resource constraints (taxes on the savings of rich people)
MMTers often point out that real resource constraints (which manifest themselves in inflation) are the real constraint on government spending. 		But I think this has given people the mistaken impression that inflation is, per se, a function of excessive government spending.

@SaysSimonson @jbarro @RomanchukBrian Here's a nice chart showing exactly what happened. Rich people got tax cuts, had a bunch more money, and voila, suddenly... https://t.co/zNzo5bxOFO
@SaysSimonson @jbarro @RomanchukBrian I remember before the Trump tax cuts, everyone was like "who's going to buy all this new debt!?" and the answer was obvious: "Well, a bunch of rich people are going to have more money to invest" and indeed if you look at UST buying, it's become more domestic since the TCJA.
@SaysSimonson @jbarro @RomanchukBrian So what that means is that there's now an extra $1 billion that's been spent into the economy, and that money will end up being parked somewhere.		So if you're trying to answer "where will the money come from to buy the debt" the answer is that the gov spent it into existence.
@SaysSimonson @jbarro @RomanchukBrian Right. The important thing to bear in mind is that government "borrowing" is the mirror of government spending. So a government might borrow $1 billion, but that also means they've spent $1 billion more into the economy than they've taken in via taxes.
@conorsen Why is a former congressman who's not running for anything doing all these videos.
@SaysSimonson @jbarro @RomanchukBrian There isn't. It's not that people find USTs to be all that compelling. It's that, ultimately, That's what you end up doing with USDs if you have them.
@SaysSimonson @jbarro @RomanchukBrian The question is, what's the alternative? They can buy other stuff (real estate, stocks and so on) but then the previous holders of those assets then face the same problem.
@SaysSimonson @jbarro @RomanchukBrian So the natural place the China to park its dollars is in USTs. And if they don't want to buy USTs, then they'll buy other stuff, but then that creates a new class of dollar holders, who will then be natural UST buyers.
@SaysSimonson @jbarro We did a good podcast with @RomanchukBrian on this, and one key idea is that as long as there are dollars sloshing around overseas then eventually they'll end up buying Treasuries.
@SaysSimonson @jbarro What specifically do you mean by that?
If Trump declares an emergency as a way to break the shutdown impasse, then I think The Coin is definitely on the table to deal with the debt ceiling.
@josephlawler I mean, you seem like a pretty normal, well-adjusted fellow.

@Rycon This looks really interesting. Thank you.
I.E., if your country has the institutional capacity to maintain an institution that has some immunity from direct political pressure, then it probably already has a lot of things going for it that will make it so inflation has a hard time taking root.
@SMTuffy Not sure, but on some level, a central bank where its leadership feels like it can buck political pressure to some degree.
I suspect independent central banks are correlated to benign inflation, rather than a cause of it.

@cullenroche my issue is people saying "AOC said she was MMT, but then also talked about raising taxes on the rich to pay for spending" is kind of a pointless nitpick
@DuncanWeldon I'm not sure if I buy that. I think there's very little that's not applicable to UK, NZ, AU, JP, CH etc. It's also applicable to the euro area in the sense that it has good explanatory power for why the it keeps shooting itself in the foot with bad policies.
To say someone can't fit in with the latter, because they say some things that aren't perfectly in line with the former, is kind of a pointless nit pick.
At this point, MMT is two things		1) An attempt to accurately characterize how the already existing fiscal system actually works.		2) An ideological framework aimed at challenging conventional views about the limits and risks associated with fiscal policy.

@jneeley78 Ah yes, that too
By and large, bankshot theories -- "Well, if the data is bad enough then that will encourage the Fed to slow down on rate hikes and that will be good for the market" --  are a waste of time.
Yesterday's weak ISM sent markets lower and today's strong data is sending markets higher, which confirms my general world view that good news is good news and bad news is bad news.
The purpose of going back and looking at wrong predictions of full employment isn't to mock people for being wrong, but to promote intellectual humility, and maybe if we're lucky to get people to stress test their basic premises.
