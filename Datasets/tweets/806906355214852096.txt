When Senator Klobuchar asked him whether he had ever blacked out from drinking, Kavanaugh said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Have you?‚Äù If he doesn‚Äôt know, then how does he know that Dr. Ford‚Äôs testimony, which the President originally called ‚Äúvery credible‚Äù and ‚Äúvery compelling,‚Äù isn‚Äôt true?
Dr. Ford testified not just as a citizen and professor, but as a daughter, wife and Mom, yet she did not hypothesize a Right-Wing conspiracy, attack GOP Senators or dodge and fudge relevant questions. She demonstrated character and temperament befitting a SCOTUS nominee.
Kavanagh explains his sputtering, unhinged diatribe before the Senate by saying ‚ÄúI was there as a son, husband and dad.‚Äù Well, how about reappearing then, this time as a Supreme Court nominee, without partisan bias, wild conspiracy theories and evasion of relevant questions?
McConnell‚Äôs outrageously deceptive, self-pitying and evasive statement on Kavanaugh is scandalous given his utterly partisan squashing of Judge Merrick Garland‚Äôs nomination to the Court and refusal even to conduct a hearing over 11 months.
So proud of Frederick County Executive @JanGardnerExec and her consistent delivery of excellent results for the people of Frederick. https://t.co/EqWGvIAHBO

Is there anyone left in the White House who can tell ‚Äúthe President‚Äù to stop waging war against the federal workforce that America needs?
He said he was going to drain the swamp but he built a hotel on the swamp and drained the treasury instead. Now he wants to punish and demoralize the people who make Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid work for the American people by freezing their pay.
After trillion-dollar tax giveaways to the wealthiest Americans and non-stop personal self-enrichment by way of foreign government business payments, this genius now revokes raises for the people who actually work for the American people. https://t.co/CzC42C9S8C

"It provides covered reporters with a qualified privilege and contains exceptions for compelled disclosure of a source when national security is threatened, when there is a threat of imminent bodily harm or death, and in other limited situations."-@RepRaskin
"This exact same federal shield law legislation passed the House with overwhelming bipartisan support (398-21) in 2007 and the bill was championed by none other than then-Congressman, now Vice President, Mike Pence."-@RepRaskin
"The Free Flow of Information Act is long overdue, but there could be no better time to pass it than now, a time of peril to the Republic, when foreign autocrats are trying to subvert our elections &amp; when the basic values of our society are in danger."-@RepRaskin
"I approached @Jim_Jordan on the spot &amp; asked whether he would introduce this measure with me &amp; I will never forget his immediate &amp; enthusiastic response.  It has given me hope that we can come together across party lines to defend the basic institutions of democracy."-@RepRaskin

"It‚Äôs time to pass a federal shield law to protect the press, whose work is essential to strong democracy. America favors shield laws to protect the media watchdog. Fully 49 states &amp; D.C. have passed shield laws or adopted some sort of reporter‚Äôs privilege."-@RepRaskin
"We cannot afford as a society to have reporters attacked, intimidated or fearful; that they will be thrown into jail just for doing their jobs. Congress must defend the free press and the American public‚Äôs right to know what exactly the gov't is doing in their name."-@RepRaskin
"Reporters are berated and castigated daily by the President; journalists are arrested, punched, attacked and even murdered, including in my home state of Maryland, simply for doing their jobs. "-@RepRaskin
"As in other times of sharp political division and national stress, like the period of the Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798, the press is under ferocious political attack today."-@RepRaskin
.@RepRaskin quotes Jefferson: ‚ÄúWere it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.‚Äù
"When reporters can‚Äôt do their jobs, our ability to function as a reflective democracy suffers. The free press is not the enemy of the people but the people‚Äôs best friend and the tyrant‚Äôs worst enemy."-@RepRaskin
"The First Amendment protects a free press, but that abstract guarantee means nothing if reporters cannot protect confidential sources and whistleblowers, or if they have to live in fear of criminal prosecution and jail time."-@RepRaskin
"The Framers insisted upon protecting the distinctive and indispensable role that the press plays as a free institution in a democratic society."- @RepRaskin

Of course the destabilization of our election happened under the Obama Administration. The purpose was to steal the election! Is Trump so stupid as not to understand that or is he just deflecting, denying and covering up for his fellow autocrat? Pathetic.
Trump keeps saying, ‚ÄúWhere is the server?‚Äù He is the server. He serves Vladimir Putin. Shameful, disgraceful, shocking. https://t.co/vRTuLAx06A

How can a president potentially implicated in working with a foreign power to control a U.S. election be allowed to name a judge to the Supreme Court who champions the criminal and civil untouchability of the president?
When Trump publicly called on ‚ÄúRussia‚Äù to hack Hillary‚Äôs emails, at the very least he aided &amp; abetted a crime against the American ppl. If you publicly urge a mob to burn a house, it‚Äôs aiding &amp; abetting arson. This is aiding &amp; abetting cyber-theft &amp; interference w/ fed elections. https://t.co/Dgkzcf7j8m

Orwell wrote in 1984, "We have cut the links between child and parent,‚Äù and ‚Äúchildren will be taken away from their mothers..." This Orwellian policy is fine for an authoritarian regime, not so much for the greatest liberal democracy that ever existed.
The White House wants to erect tent cities to house unaccompanied children. More than 1,000 children could be forced to live in makeshift tents as they are separated from their families. Is this America?
More than 1,300 kids, some as young as two years old, have been pulled apart from their families and sent God-knows-where. @RepJayapal saw mothers who ‚Äúcould not stop crying.‚Äù We must have a hearing about what is taking place in the name of the American people.
The Statue of Liberty quotes Emma Lazarus‚Äô poem: ‚ÄúGive me your tired, your poor. Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free. The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.‚Äù Trump adds: ‚Äúand then we‚Äôll separate them from their children.‚Äù
Many families arrive in America fleeing domestic violence, gang violence, &amp; gov't oppression. Many parents arrive at lawful ports of entry &amp; yet are still separated from their kids. This is America, a ‚Äúhaven of refuge,‚Äù as Paine put it, for people fleeing oppression &amp; violence.
Many parents being separated from their children have arrived with valid asylum claims at lawful ports of entry. Yet they are treated like criminals. Why are their kids being ripped away from them when they have not even had ‚Äúcredible fear‚Äù hearings on their asylum petitions?
Has it not always been the practice of the Judiciary Committee that Members can be recognized to speak to matters of justice important to the people of the United States? Thanks @RepJayapal for your first-hand account of a shameful policy.
Chairman Goodlatte tried to stop Members of the House Judiciary Committee from addressing Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúzero tolerance‚Äù policy that has separated hundreds of children from their parents at the border. But we won‚Äôt accept a gag rule on this scandalous policy; we will be heard. https://t.co/VSlSQUgPNm

Our gov't may not be turned into a $-making operation for the President &amp; his family. We must stop all exec branch officials from spending public dollars at Trump hotels, restaurants, golf courses &amp; other businesses. That's why I intro'd the #HOTELAct: https://t.co/zYI4ELsnLy
The Constitution prevents the President from receiving any emolument (any profit, benefit, gift, payment) other than his salary while in office, but Trump continues to receive profits from his properties, incl. taxpayer $ paid by fed gov't agencies patronizing Trump businesses.
Unlike previous Presidents, Donald Trump has refused to divest himself of his biz holdings &amp; instead retained his ownership interest in Trump Org, a decision presenting constant ethical problems &amp; potential constitutional violations.
I just introduced legislation to help stop the President's ongoing violations of the Constitution's Domestic Emoluments Clause. The #HOTELAct would prohibit gov't agencies from using taxpayer $ to stay/dine at Trump-owned hotels, restaurants or other properties.
If the President does not have enough respect for the Constitution to refuse extra gov't payments beyond his official salary, then we must cut the unlawful payments off at the source. Read about the #HOTELAct: https://t.co/i0QsQPV4Fo

The #IranDeal is working. All of Iran‚Äôs pathways to getting nuclear weapons are blocked. Why would we risk it now?
It would be madness to destroy a deal that blocks Iran‚Äôs nuclear development and that is making the world safer. #IranDeal
Walking away from #IranDeal would squander US credibility on world stage, making us a pariah state &amp; undermining prospects for peace w/ NK.
Trump‚Äôs own DefSec said #IranDeal advances our nat'l security, but Trump wants to unleash as much chaos abroad as he has created at home.
The IAEA, the EU, 80 nuclear policy experts, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen Dunford &amp; DefSec Mattis all say Iran is complying w/ the deal.
#IranDeal features one of the most robust inspection regimes-uses tech to verify compliance &amp; grants IAEA unprecedented access to inspect.
Under the deal, Iran forfeited 98% of its enriched uranium, decommissioned 2/3 of centrifuges &amp; poured cement into core of its Arak reactor.

"Law and Order" for people on the street; "anything goes" for the White House and royal family. Sick. https://t.co/pQqaRddXKP
Trump thinks the only rule that law enforcement must follow is never investigate the president. He wants a palace guard.
Trump wants to remove any restrictions on law enforcement-unless they're investigating him, and then they get fired and harassed.
What is this, Duterte's Philippines? Putin's Russia?¬†Trump has no respect for the rule of law. Obscene. https://t.co/pQqaRddXKP
