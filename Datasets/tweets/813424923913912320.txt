@NHL94 @loreality They can. I imagine though if I'm playing and think I'm in or don't know and an observer calls me in, if the other team started complaining, I'd keep playing. There'd have to be a lot to get me to not move the disc. You'd be calling a spirit TO during active play. Difficult.
@NHL94 @loreality Basically right away. Think about a regular in/out call that's at midfield. Its active so players would have to stop play which is hectic. The player called in would have to overrule the observer or someone on their team would have to speak up
@NHL94 @loreality A player may overrule an observer call if it benefits the other team, so that would be included here. Exception is a misconduct. If an observer gives you a tmf for hard contact on me, I can't overrule that card
@NHL94 @loreality Teams can do that. Teams can call spirit timeouts. Observer rulings can be overturned (except for misconduct calls) by the party that benefits. IE - observer calls you in but you thought you were out. You'd have to stop active play though to call a spirit timeout in that sitch
