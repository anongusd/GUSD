Voted against #GOPTaxScam. It would increase the national debt by trillions of $$, provide most of its tax cuts to the rich (TWO-THIRDS of the cuts in this bill would go to households with incomes over $240,000), and create pressure to cut Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.

More than 5 million in PA have pre-existing medical conditions, and #ACA prohibits insurance companies from charging them more or denying them coverage. Republicans want to take us back to when insurance companies could discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions.
To help Americans w #opioid addiction, @POTUS and Congressional GOP should stop trying to take health insurance coverage away from them (and millions of others) by	-repealing #ACA	-undermining protections for pre-existing conditions, and	-restricting eligibility for #Medicaid.

Now we have to sit down and negotiate a budget going forward.
I voted to end the #shutdown and avoid default on the nat'l debt - but Congress will have to revisit these issues in the next 2-4 months.

A govt shutdown could easily cost taxpayers more than a billion dollars‚Äô worth of lost work and uncollected revenues.
If the govt shuts down, 30,000 active military in PA will serve without paychecks &amp; 23,000 DoD civilian employees in PA will be furloughed.
A govt shutdown wouldn‚Äôt affect current SS benefits or new benefit applications, claims, and appeals ‚Äì but it would hurt other SS services
A govt shutdown could delay SBA loan programs, which approve an average of 1,000 applications per week and supported 571,383 jobs last year.
If Boehner put the clean Senate CR up for a vote it would pass with bipartisan support; instead he's joined Tea Party to shut down the govt.

I‚Äôve cosponsored a bill to extend current #SNAP benefit levels, which are scheduled to expire in November. #EndHungerNow #SaveSNAP
Instead of working to #EndHungerNow, House Republicans just voted to cut nearly $40 billion from #SNAP. I voted against the cuts. #SaveSNAP
#SNAP feeds mostly kids, seniors, &amp; disabled. Recipients currently get $1.40 a meal. We must protect these crucial benefits. #EndHungerNow
SNAP benefits lift American families out of poverty. 1.8 million Pennsylvanians and 47 million Americans rely on #SNAP to fight hunger.

There‚Äôs still more work to do, but #SCOTUS #DOMA and #PROP8 decisions are huge victories for #LGBT rights and marriage equality.
#SCOTUS overturns #PROP8 ‚Äì it only affects one state but it‚Äôs the biggest one! This means marriage equality for thousands in California.
#SCOTUS rejects #DOMA - huge victory for fairness and compassion. A big win for the LGBT community &amp; all of us who support marriage equality
