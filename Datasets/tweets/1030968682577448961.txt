@KamalaHarris #MentalIllness is the #motive
@nytimes Hey @nytimes, have you fired that #racist hag #SarahJeong yet?
@KaraMar111 @JillDoby You're not helpful, Bill!
@AlanWattsDaily @Cernovich Just don't assign a worship deity or set of rules to those wishes and we're all good.
@TheGypsyThread @EckleyToni Because it's utter bullshit. Please stop posting fake bullshit news. Take the few minutes it takes to do your own research to try to validate or INVALIDATE bullshit. It would go a long way to making the world a better place.
@AmyMek @EckleyToni #FuckUber why is it I've never heard of this dangerous crime from #taxi #CabDrivers? What's up #uber? Are you doing proper #BackgroundChecks?
@latimes And the focus is immediately shifted away from PTSD on back onto democrat red meat gun control. The tool is secondary to the motive. The motive is #MENTALILLNESS
@NBCNews Did he wear legally purchased clothing, too? What's the point? Can we please, FFS, focus on the honest-to-goodness real problem - MENTAL FUCKING HEALTH!
@latimes They clearly missed something. We can launch a Telsa around the fucking sun, but we can't identify the neuro bio markers that indicate potential violence? Maybe if we shifted from the political gun shit show and focused attention and dollars on MENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH we'd get it.
@jgl61 @RepThompson Clearly, they missed something then or they failed to follow up. Someone doesn't just do something like this when they are healthy minded.
@1bigbeer @warrant05_tony @grant_freedom Wonderful.
@RepThompson Please put effort into establishing routine mental illness evaluations and check ups in returning wartime vets and other high risk public such as convicted schedule 1 drug addicts. I wholly believe if as much attention is paid to motive as is the mechanism, it will reduce deaths.
@KTLA Ill #MentalHealth was the motive. A hand gun was the misused mechanism. Keeping the mechanism away from the motive is what needs to be solved.	Needlessly attacking the mechanism and ignoring the motive is political. Properly addressing the motive will render the mechanism moot.
This piece of shit is spreading fake, debunked information about the #ThousandOaksShooting shooter #DavidIanLong. While it's reasonable to be on guard for #IslamicTerrorism which has happened, this is a #Veteran with #PTSD. To say otherwise hinders help.	https://t.co/N8Jr4k8xmd
@warrant05_tony @grant_freedom Stop spreading fake shit, loser. They interviewed his neighbor who called 911 on him. He never - not even in passing - mentioned this bullshit. It will happen, but it didn't happen here. So you are not helpful. Focus on supporting Vets with mental illness. Don't be a dick.
@latimes So your saying strict gun laws may not be indicative of safer communities. So can we now divert those resources onto a more predictive cause of mass killings - mental illness? The tool has little to do with motive. That should be evident as law enforcement never interview the gun

@WIRED @CNN @Acosta Don't you have anything better to do than spin cotton candy for addicts?
@latimes @latimesopinion We must progress from the wrong-headed, political red meat chatter that this is a gun problem and move on to the real, uncomfortable truth that this is a people problem - a mental illness problem. The instrument of death is irrelevant. The problem is WHY not HOW. Emphasis. Focus.
@WashTimes @JackPosobiec Don't be DICKS and make this shooting into something it's not - it's not a religious attack. It's pretty clear it was a soldier with PTSD who slipped under the April 2018 mental health screening as the result of a neighbor 911 call regarding domestic disturbance. Don't be a dick.
@ABC7 Unreal. Out for a night of dancing and wound up the target of an unhinged gunman. 	When is the time to demand regular mental health screenings and monitoring for high risk individuals such as returning soldiers and those with violent tendencies? There must be signs we're missing.
@CBSLA @GavinNewsom When is anyone going to be so brave as to say, insist that it is mental illness - you know that mysterious, often mocked, shamed and hidden disease - that is at the root of most shootings. Of course there are outliers like religious nuts, domestic abuse, pure rage and ill intent.

@DelgadoforNY19 Mental Health violence.
@washingtonpost It's not the mechanism of death, it's the motion that put that mechanism into action. IT'S MENTAL FUCKING HEALTH. Until we acknowledge that an invisible health crisis - one which we cannot see or examine under a microscope in a tangible way, then they will continue.
@NancyPelosi @HouseDemocrats It's mental health, not guns. It's not the mechanism of death, it's the motion that put that mechanism into action. It's MENTAL FUCKING HEALTH. Got it?
Thank you, Sergeant, for the ultimate sacrifice to protect the public from harm. It is people like you who make the world better. I am so sorry for your family's loss. You must have been an amazing human being. https://t.co/4ZCiN2ecUM
@ABC7 I watched an interview of the neighbor who called the sheriffs on him. He said that is sounded as if the shooter had, at that time, been tearing down the walls of his house with a hammer. He also said that law enforcement and mental health officials were with the suspect all day.

Go watch a George Carlin video. And yes, the demons of hell are probably waiting for the Clinton's arrival. Halloween is not just for kids.
@kjfriend2 @CBSLARachel @CBSLA @KCBSKCALDesk @code20photog @jenpierce12 @StewartTVNews It's just Halloween decorations. Some snarky dude tried to compare it to Kathy Griffin's effigy of Trump's head. But that is a false comparison. These are simply political satire, not political provocation, imo.
@jennicake @CBSLARachel @KCBSKCALDesk @CBSLA @code20photog @jenpierce12 @StewartTVNews You have no right. You think you do, like all entitled millennials, to command people who challenge your feelings out of places, but you don't. So take in the awkwardness that is outside ideas.
@EricJRacy @CBSLARachel @KCBSKCALDesk @CBSLA @code20photog @jenpierce12 @StewartTVNews I've had my head examined actually. I'm all good! When was the last time you had a mental tune up? Drugs don't count.
@EricJRacy @CBSLARachel @KCBSKCALDesk @CBSLA @code20photog @jenpierce12 @StewartTVNews KG did not mean it to be funny. She wore a scowl and it was overtly gory. It was provocative, which is distinct from satire. So I think it was more of a desperate grand stand. It's also far more violent and out of context than styrofoam headstones at Halloween.
@kjfriend2 @CBSLARachel @CBSLA @KCBSKCALDesk @code20photog @jenpierce12 @StewartTVNews Political satire is PROTECTED AND CHERISHED FREE SPEECH. You don't get to just "take it down" because it makes your undies twist a bit. That's the point of it actually. Chill out.
@beckisellshomes @CBSLARachel @CBSLA @KCBSKCALDesk @code20photog @jenpierce12 @StewartTVNews totally...
@EricJRacy @CBSLARachel @KCBSKCALDesk @CBSLA @code20photog @jenpierce12 @StewartTVNews I don't find it offensive. I find it funny and relevant within the context of politics and Halloween. If you can't piece that together than it's possible you're not savvy enough to entertain satirical comedy. It's political satire. Totally cherished and protected free speech.
@jlbrown867 @Patharveynews @CBSLA @11 so sensitive
@Patharveynews @CBSLA @11 Perfect use of the political circus during Halloween. Is there anything scarier than politicians? How they change shape, sink underground, float above, gorge on the taxpayers? I say cheers to the clever homeowner!

@jennicake @CBSLARachel @KCBSKCALDesk @CBSLA @code20photog @jenpierce12 @StewartTVNews This holiday is for everybody, not just kids, hence horror movies, haunted houses, booze infused parties.

@TeamPelosi Hey, @TeamPelosi, do you remember that time at DNC camp when Hillary Clinton and Donna Brazile sabotaged Bernie Sanders and usurped the democratic process and disenfranchised millions of American voters? That was some serious election meddling and corruption. No? See you in Nov. https://t.co/jSwZE6Ixs7
@KamalaHarris ✔️Higher office	✔️Illegal immigrant rights	✔️Corrupt democrat politicians
@slacker_ga @POTUS it's all fair play.

@KamalaHarris It is unacceptable that tens of millions of Illegal Immigrants are more of a priority of our elected officials than American citizens. We need a state and federal Congress that works for the American people, not just the illegal immigrant voter. See you in November. https://t.co/CtWfoO4SEB

@KamalaHarris Keep our American kids safe! Deport dangerous illegal aliens who rape, rob and murder them and repeal prop 47 which let criminals out of jail to re-offend.
