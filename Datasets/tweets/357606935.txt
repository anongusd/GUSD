The pardon and clemency powers are supposed to be about granting mercy to the powerless, not immunity for the powerful. The next President should promise: No pardons or commutations for any person implicated as part of a federal criminal investigation related to Donald Trump.
But here’s the biggest threat right now: Donald Trump, or the next President, using the pardon power to cover up and permanently excuse this wrongdoing.
Our criminal justice system is hanging on and doing its job – the truth is coming out – despite unprecedented, relentless, and potentially illegal pressure from Donald Trump and his associates in and out of government.
Donald Trump and his associates are trying to sabotage our criminal justice system. Read my full break-down here: https://t.co/NcXaN8RQT8
34 individuals and 3 companies have been indicted, convicted, or pled guilty. And now Michael Cohen – who’s been involved in everything he’s done for decades including his time in the White House – has confessed to breaking the law on Trump’s behalf.
Michael Cohen, one of Donald Trump’s most trusted advisors, just implicated him in criminal activity while he’s been in the White House. It’s the most descriptive account of illegal acts committed by Donald Trump and the people working for him.

But I believe the biggest risk in this election is failing to empower the millions of people who feel the squeeze of an economy rigged against them and the deep frustration of a failing political system that produced Donald Trump in the first place. So let’s change it.
There are some Democrats who are so deeply afraid of losing to Donald Trump that they don’t want to risk saying or doing anything different at all. Even if they agree that we need big, structural change, they see challenging the status quo as an electoral risk.
If we build our campaign person to person, town to town, all across this country, it means we’ll win up and down the ballot in 2020. And we’ll have the power to make big, structural changes in 2021. https://t.co/XENfWmb1WC
On our campaign, there’ll be no event you’ll be excluded from because you can’t afford it, and no better seats or 1:1 time with me at events if you can. What you donate shouldn’t determine the amount of time you get to spend with a candidate. My plan: https://t.co/nVNiiGyOPd
It’s been estimated that up to 70% of a congressional candidate’s time is spent with potential wealthy donors. It’s safe to assume that goes for presidential campaigns too, and presidential donors are disproportionately white, male, and wealthy. We have to do things differently.
Let’s call out something that usually goes unspoken: Presidential candidates spend way too much time with wealthy donors. For every time you see a presidential candidate talking with voters, they’re spending three or four times as long with wealthy donors behind closed doors.
I’ve already said that I'll run my campaign differently – no Washington lobbyist money, no dark money, no super PACs. But today, I’m going further. My presidential primary campaign will be run on the principle of equal access for anybody who joins it.

Gun violence is an emergency.	Climate change is an emergency.	Our country's opioid epidemic is an emergency.		Donald Trump's ridiculous wall is not an emergency.

If we work together and demand action, we can prevent more avoidable deaths. Kids shouldn’t have to fear going to school, or be traumatized by lockdown drills, because of the absurd, corrupt reality of our gun laws. #ParklandStrong #GunReformNow https://t.co/qaFTorGUGt
The @NRA has captured the @GOP. Republican politicians blocking any gun reform are choosing the promise of money, or the threat of withdrawing it, over protecting kids. It’s corrupt, and it’s a moral stain on every one of them. #GunReformNow
There are so many common-sense gun reforms that Americans support. Just a few: 		✔️Ban assault weapons &amp; bump-stocks	✔️End the gun show loophole	✔️Prevent domestic abusers from legally obtaining guns		But 1 yr later, Congress hasn’t lifted a finger bc of plain, rancid corruption.
A year ago today, someone intent on doing harm was able to murder 17 students and teachers in Parkland because they had a military-grade gun. 		We grieve with victims’ families. And we fight alongside the Parkland students to fix our laws. #ParklandStrong

Real, fundamental change in America will be hard. There are a lot of people out there with money and power who will try to stop us. Here’s what I say to them: https://t.co/r0hpHZussK
We come from different backgrounds. Different religions. Different languages. Different experiences. We have different dreams. Today, we come together— ready to raise our voices together until this fight is won. We’re all in the fight to build an America that works for everyone. https://t.co/B06CmzIgy8
More than 50 years ago, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. went to Montgomery and warned us about the danger of division. That playbook has been around forever. The rich and powerful use fear to divide us.	 	We’re done with that. Bigotry has no place in the Oval Office.
I believe real democracy requires equal justice under law. 		It’s not equal justice when African Americans are more likely than whites to be arrested, more likely to be charged, more likely to be convicted, and more likely to be sentenced.		No more.
Let’s be clear: I won't take a dime of PAC money in this campaign. I won't take a single check from a federal lobbyist, or billionaires who want to run a Super PAC on my behalf. 	 	And I challenge every other candidate who asks for your vote in this primary to do the same.
Our fight is to change the rules so that our government works for everyone. That means:	 	✔️A #GreenNewDeal	✔️Fair housing	✔️#MedicareForAll	✔️Affordable childcare	✔️Student loan relief	✔️Overturning Citizens United
RT if you agree: We need real tax reform in this country.		My #UltraMillionaireTax would make the richest tippy-top 0.1% of Americans start doing their part for the country that helped make them rich.
Time to change the rules to put more economic power in the hands of the American people – workers and small businesses. We need to put power back in the hands of workers, and take on Wall Street so that the big banks can never again threaten the security of our economy. https://t.co/6tiWVTopwb
We need to #EndCorruptionNow in Washington. Let’s	 	✅Close the revolving door between Wall Street and Washington	✅End lobbying as we know it	✅Ban foreign governments from hiring lobbyists in Washington	✅Fix the Swiss cheese definition of “lobbyist"
America’s middle class has been deliberately hollowed out. The richest, most powerful people in America lobbied Washington and paid off politicians to tilt the system. And year by year, bit by bit, more of the wealth and opportunity went to the people at the very top.
I grew up in Oklahoma, on the ragged edge of the middle class. When my daddy had a heart attack, my family nearly tumbled over the financial cliff.	 	But we didn’t. My mother’s minimum-wage job answering phones at Sears saved our house, and saved our family.
This is the fight of our lives. The fight to build an America where dreams are possible, an America that works for everyone. I am in that fight all the way.		And that is why I’m in Lawrence, MA today: to declare that I am a candidate for President of the United States of America.

2 years ago, I got thrown off the Senate floor for reading a letter from Coretta Scott King about Jeff Sessions. Every GOP Senator voted to silence me so America wouldn’t hear her voice. But here’s the thing: They only made us louder. #ShePersisted
Two years ago, I never expected “Nevertheless, She Persisted” to become a meme, a t-shirt slogan, or a tattoo for people all across the country who were tired of being told to sit down &amp; shut up. We will resist, we will persist, and we will win. #ShePersisted https://t.co/Fjr3HgYSYp

@realDonaldTrump This cruelty isn’t an accident – it's all part of @realDonaldTrump's plan. Puerto Rico has suffered enough. This ugliness has gone far enough. We won’t allow anyone to sabotage the island’s recovery – not even the President of the United States.
Before @realDonaldTrump announces his next wild scheme to build his monument to hate, let’s set the record straight about who WON’T be paying for @realDonaldTrump’s dumb wall:		❌ Mexico	❌ American taxpayers	❌ Puerto Rican disaster victims

Middle-class families are sick of stagnant wages &amp; exploding costs. They're sick of a Washington that works only for the wealthy &amp; the well-connected. They don't want to replace a self-absorbed billionaire President with another one. Americans want real change. We should listen.
With the revenue from the #UltraMillionaireTax, we could provide universal childcare for working parents across America. A path to student debt relief for those who need it. Down payments on a Green New Deal &amp; Medicare for All. Schultz might not need those things. America does.
Dear Howard Schultz: if you’re looking for bold ideas with broad bipartisan appeal for your “centrist” presidential campaign, may I suggest my #UltraMillionaireTax? https://t.co/x9srshMmWB

These racist images are deeply disturbing. Hatred and discrimination have no place in our country and must not be tolerated, especially from our leaders – Republican or Democrat. Northam must resign.
This year the wealthiest top 0.1% in America are projected to owe 3.2% of their wealth in taxes. The bottom 99% are projected to owe 7.2%. My new #UltraMillionaireTax helps level the playing field by asking the 0.1% to pay their fair share. https://t.co/HqBkpSuwBn
Here's how we prevent a nuclear conflict:		1. Don't build new nukes.	2. Don't undermine arms control treaties that protect America &amp; our allies.	3. Commit to never using a nuke first.		@realDonaldTrump is doing the opposite on all three. And that makes America less safe.
Yes, Russia has violated the INF Treaty. But our response shouldn't be to walk away, let Russia deploy as many missiles as it wants, &amp; put our European allies back in the crosshairs of conflict.
While @realDonaldTrump brags about his "nuclear button," his admin keeps increasing the risk of nuclear war. The White House wants billions to upgrade nukes, the national security advisor hates arms control treaties, &amp; we just began withdrawing from one. https://t.co/h9o3Ffrznc
Let’s start #BlackHistoryMonth by honoring Fannie Lou Hamer: a fierce civil rights leader. Fannie Lou championed women’s rights, voting rights &amp; workers' rights. She endured violence to help thousands of people register to vote &amp; fight illegal segregation. https://t.co/2RhvbOk9O2
#BlackHistoryMonth starts today: a time to honor African Americans and their powerfully important contributions to our country. All month, we’ll be celebrating black women &amp; the barriers they've broken – often in the face of systemic racism.
One month ago today, we launched this exploratory committee to build a grassroots movement to level the playing field. On Sat, February 9, I’ll be making a BIG announcement about my 2020 plans. Sign up now to be the first to know where I'll be making it. https://t.co/kePILOz4JC https://t.co/Zmv840W524
Our children &amp; grandchildren should grow up in a world where they can breathe the air &amp; drink the water – and go outside without risking their lives in extreme temperatures. It’s time to protect our planet &amp; pass a Green New Deal. #PolarVortex2019 https://t.co/JYnVrxMf1t
Working people can't afford to hire armies of lobbyists &amp; lawyers – but giant corporations &amp; powerful interests can &amp; do. My bill to #EndCorruptionNow would end lobbying as we know it so our government works for the people. https://t.co/YGeCSb9Z31
Why do the richest top 0.1% of Americans own almost as much wealth as 90% of America? I’ll tell you exactly how that happened. And how my #UltraMillionaireTax would make sure everybody’s kids get a chance to succeed – not just those at the tippy top. https://t.co/Wro5OdPBm4

What exactly does @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell have against more Americans voting? Of course Congress should make it easier for Americans to vote on Election Day. And we need a constitutional amendment establishing a nationally recognized right to vote. https://t.co/0pqGVBAKPB

The richest tippy-top 0.1% of Americans have nearly as much wealth as the bottom 90%. That’s bad for our economy &amp; our democracy. I talked with @chrislhayes about how my #UltraMillionaireTax would ask the 0.1% to pay their fair share and rebuild the middle class. https://t.co/fKt4W4cShX
The day @realDonaldTrump’s bigoted Muslim ban started will be seared in my brain forever. But so will what happened next: the sea of people rushing to airports, &amp; everyone in Boston &amp; nationwide that spoke out against hate. 2 yrs later, we won't forget, &amp; we won't stop fighting. https://t.co/uqVamy3SSm
Woo-hoo! @staceyabrams is a leader, a fighter, &amp; a terrific choice to deliver the Democratic response to the State of the Union address on February 5. I’m glad everyone will have the chance to hear her powerful voice. https://t.co/RKwhQTmcHD
Racism, homophobia, &amp; all forms of bigotry &amp; hate have no place in this country. The fight for equality isn’t over – no one should have to live in fear of being beaten on the street because of who they are. https://t.co/CF0G95CkTc
This is what happens when you challenge the rich and powerful. They'll fight tooth and nail against anyone who stands up to them. But we need structural change to get our economy and our democracy back on track - and no billionaire is going to get in my way of fighting for it.
Billionaires like Howard Schultz &amp; Michael Bloomberg want to keep a rigged system in place that benefits only them and their buddies. And they plan to spend gobs of cash to try and buy the Presidency to keep it that way. Not on my watch. https://t.co/x6tLPcW03J
Billions of dollars have been flushed down the drain for a completely unnecessary political stunt. How many schools &amp; roads &amp; bridges could have been fixed? How many scientists could have gotten their research funded? How many seniors could have had a hot lunch? https://t.co/mnX0Eta39Y
What's “ridiculous” is billionaires who think they can buy the presidency to keep the system rigged for themselves while opportunity slips away for everyone else. The top 0.1%, who'd pay my #UltraMillionaireTax, own about the same wealth as 90% of America. It's time for change. https://t.co/D04G5fNvpa

Our economy is rigged against working people – &amp; especially rigged against people of color. The wealthy &amp; well-connected have enormous power in Washington. It’s time to make real, structural change to our economy, our govt &amp; our politics to fix it.
CEOs should be held personally accountable when they cheat &amp; bring the economy to its knees. No bank should be too big to fail. And if you’re among the top 0.1% of America's richest households, you should pay your fair share in taxes so we can rebuild our middle class.
It turns out the big bank CEOs &amp; the executives on Wall Street are scared that we want to hold them accountable &amp; make them pay their fair share. Good. They should be. And here’s why: https://t.co/DplBFAqquA

We need to invest in clean energy, lead the fight on climate change, &amp; stop giving tax breaks to Big Oil. And one more thing: it should be illegal for former coal lobbyists like @EPAAWheeler to run the EPA. Under my bill to #EndCorruptionNow, it would. https://t.co/xjiNvGh6H2

The ultra-rich have rigged our economy &amp; rigged our tax rules. We need structural change. That’s why I’m proposing something brand-new: An annual wealth tax on the tippy-top 0.1%. We’d get $3 trillion in new revenue to invest in rebuilding the middle-class. Let’s make it happen. https://t.co/B0ImiSTxez

Tonight I’ll be on @allinwithchris at 8 PM ET to talk with @chrislhayes about my new Ultra-Millionaire Tax. I hope you’ll tune in!
It would make the ultra-rich pay their fair share &amp; generate nearly $3 trillion over the next 10 years. A lot of rich and powerful people won’t like it – but I don’t work for them. Sign our petition if you agree: It’s time to tax the wealth of the top 0.1% https://t.co/3L5jbCCQ6x
We need structural change. That’s why I’m proposing something brand new – an annual tax on the wealth of the richest Americans. I’m calling it the “Ultra-Millionaire Tax" &amp; it applies to that tippy top 0.1% –  those with a net worth of over $50M.
The rich &amp; powerful run Washington. Here’s one benefit they wrote for themselves: After making a killing from the economy they’ve rigged, they don't pay taxes on that accumulated wealth. It’s a system that’s rigged for the top if I ever saw one.

After 6 months, I’m hopeful that @nationalgridus will #endthelockout now. When workers come together in a union, they gain power to fight for better wages &amp; benefits – and I'm fighting alongside @Usw04 National Grid workers so they can get back to work. https://t.co/EWGfOxbxID
Giant drug companies only care about one thing: raking in profits on the backs of patients. Mergers that mean more money for drug company CEOs while patients pay the price are not a solution to skyrocketing drug costs. https://t.co/pk6DOPRzAL
We cannot allow billionaires &amp; giant corporations to buy our Democratic primary. Tonight I told Rachel @Maddow: Every Democratic candidate for President in 2020 should link arms &amp; pledge to run grassroots campaigns funded by the people. Disavow Super PACs &amp; self funding. https://t.co/7kElQv9shc
Thanks for tuning in to Rachel @Maddow! This has always been a grassroots campaign – &amp; we need you with us from the beginning. Sign up to be part of our fight: https://t.co/BNl2I1m8OX
In just a few minutes, I’ll be live with Rachel @Maddow on @MSNBC. I’m looking forward to talking about our fight to rebuild the middle class so that everyone gets a fighting chance. Tune in!
Corruption in Washington isn't about a single president or political party.  It runs deep. We should call it out – &amp; we should pass my sweeping anti-corruption reforms to clamp down on all the ways giant companies drown govt in money to get their way.
We need a lifetime ban on Members of Congress working as lobbyists to make sure they only serve the public. We need a ban on foreign lobbying so countries like China, Russia and Saudi Arabia have to conduct their foreign policy out in the open. I've proposed both.
ZTE is a giant foreign telecom company that's close with the Chinese govt. They've violated serious U.S. sanctions on Iran &amp; N. Korea. Their lobbyists keep blocking accountability. And today former Senator @JoeLieberman joined them. Should that be legal? No.
I hear women candidates are most likable in the quiet car! I’ll be talking again on @maddow @ 9pm ET. https://t.co/DnVIw2RSgG
Tonight I’m talking to Rachel @Maddow at 9 PM ET on @MSNBC about this new chapter in our grassroots fight to put political power back in the hands of the American people. I hope you’ll tune in.

Every person in America should be able to work hard, play by the same set of rules, &amp; take care of themselves &amp; the people they love.

Under the #TrumpShutdown, critical programs to help victims of sexual assault &amp; domestic abuse are at a standstill. @realDonaldTrump must end the #TrumpShutdown so that Congress can reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. https://t.co/cx6n2Q7KAa
The people sent us to Washington to have their backs – not to play games with their lives. But we’re in Day 8 of the #TrumpShutdown, all because @realDonaldTrump rejected the Senate’s plan to keep the government open. We need a government that works for the people.

Thousands of federal employees are in limbo over the holiday. Authorization for programs to help victims of sexual assault &amp; domestic abuse has expired.		This is what @realDonaldTrump said he'd be "proud" to do. #TrumpShutdown
Who does the GOP think runs federal buildings across the country? Thousands of janitors, cafeteria workers, security guards, &amp; others who need every paycheck will be hurt by this completely avoidable disaster. I'm thinking of them this holiday season.  https://t.co/UD31jBuyvD
.@realDonaldTrump’s tantrum means that hundreds of thousands of people will be celebrating Christmas without knowing when they’ll get their next paycheck. https://t.co/LzRnWDWjOq
We’re fighting for a government that works for the people — not a government of bigotry and fear. Decided to get a little inspiration this morning. https://t.co/2DNtIg32hy
.@realDonaldTrump said he would be “proud” to shut down the government. Now critical parts of the US gov &amp; federal employees are getting hurt. Spending billions of taxpayer $ on a stupid wall won’t make our country safer. Let’s be clear: this is a distraction to keep us divided.
But there’s a reason this is called the #FirstStepAct – &amp; that’s because it doesn’t go nearly far enough. Our criminal justice system is deeply broken &amp; in need of real, systemic change. We will keep fighting until it delivers on the promise of equal justice for all.
This week the Senate passed the #FirstStepAct, a bipartisan prison &amp; sentencing reform bill. This bill includes important things I’ve fought for, like banning the practice of shackling pregnant prisoners, &amp; other reforms like limiting solitary confinement for juvenile offenders. https://t.co/KhH800vLyg
The window for dealing with climate change is rapidly closing. The moment is upon us. We must act, using all of our tools – including all of our foreign policy tools – to bring as many nations with us as possible. That's what global leadership looks like. https://t.co/z3k6ce9fZN
Big Pharma will hate my new plan to bring competition to the generic drug market by publicly manufacturing generic drugs. But Congress doesn’t work for giant drug companies – we work for the American people. https://t.co/Uuf8MVr2Ko
In November, voters took the first step to hold Congress accountable for turning their backs on the American people. Now Congress can do more to help level the playing field, like passing the Accountable Capitalism Act &amp; our plan to #EndCorruptionNow.
I don’t think a single working family in this country should pay more taxes so that big corporations &amp; billionaires can pay less. But that’s what the #GOPTaxScam did –  raising taxes on some middle class families &amp; handing out $1.5 TRILLION in tax giveaways to the ultra wealthy.
1 year ago today, @realDonaldTrump &amp; Republicans pulled a heist on the American people when they passed the #GOPTaxScam. 		They said it would would help working families. Then they stole money from the middle class to help their billionaire donors instead. https://t.co/cryXVsUPgM
There's a real problem with our economy. For decades, workers have helped create record corporate profits, but their wages don’t budge.

The @NRA shut down legislation after Newtown. Day after day, month after month, it keeps happening. School shootings, drive-by shootings, random shootings. Congress does nothing. So we'll keep fighting – for families of #SandyHook &amp; across this country. No compromise on this.
Today is the 6-yr anniversary of the massacre at #SandyHook – a day so many of us will never forget. 26 innocent children &amp; adults were murdered in their classrooms. It felt like we’d finally reached the point as a country that we couldn’t live through another tragedy like that.

That’s right, my opponent is proud of his endorsement by @mike_pence, who:	 ✔️Tried to defund @PPFA  	 ✔️Suggested marriage equality would lead to “societal collapse”	 ✔️Signed radical anti-abortion laws	 ✔️Tried to redefine rape to “forcible rape” for federal funding of abortion
Surprise, surprise: Vice President @mike_pence just endorsed our GOP opponent &amp; called him a “rock-solid conservative with a tremendous record.” And guess what? Geoff Diehl is proud to have Pence’s support. https://t.co/tk0zOG2GLp

Millions of people watched you, @realDonaldTrump, as you fumbled and lied on your $1 million pledge. It then took a day for your handlers to tee up this recycled racist name-calling. You’ve lost a step, and in 21 days, you’re going to lose Congress.
Tick-tock, @realDonaldTrump. November 6th is coming.
Yeah, @realDonaldTrump will keep insulting me. Let him. We’ll be busy registering voters, knocking on doors, making sure our neighbors know the facts, &amp; telling them about what we're ready to do to build pride, hope, &amp; opportunity all across our country. https://t.co/sb2oPItfwS
And on November 6, if you’re tired of getting scammed by your President, stand with me, and with the reformers on the ballot in your community, and let’s elect new leadership so we can start getting things back on track in Washington.
At the end of the day, I trust the people of Massachusetts to look at the facts about who I am and how I've lived my life and make their own judgment about me. But remember: @realDonaldTrump doesn't have the same kind of faith in you.
But to do that, we’ve got to work as hard as we can between now and November 6 to tune out the lies, ignore the chaos, shrug off the fake bluster, and focus on organizing for REAL change.
I’m ready to reverse the trillion-dollar tax scam and use that money to help cut student loan debt and rebuild infrastructure, ready to stand WITH our allies AGAINST our enemies, and get to work on clean energy, immigration reform, and gun safety.
I’m ready to support working people and help middle class families build real security. I’m ready to root out corruption and clean up Washington. I’m ready to stop the politics of hatred and division so we can bring back core American values like diversity and respect.
Like I promised @NCAI1944 in February, whenever someone brings up my family story, I’ll use it to lift up the story of Native families and communities. I'll use it today to lift up the NIWRC and their amazing work to protect Native women from violence. https://t.co/DyHTeIU4uo
But nicknames don’t help families pay for child care. Conspiracy theories won’t solve climate change. Racial slurs can’t raise wages or make our communities safer.
Here's the deal: @realDonaldTrump’s Washington is more corrupt &amp; more out of touch than ever. And it turns out @realDonaldTrump never had any plan to make things better, &amp; he has no plan now. All he can offer are attacks &amp; distractions.
And @realDonaldTrump should be scared – because on November 6, we’re going to bust up that con once and for all.
And you know what scares him the most? Us. The American people. He’s afraid we’ll see him for who he really is and expose the con he’s been running on our country from Day One.
He’s afraid to stand up to Vladimir Putin in defense of our country, afraid to talk to Robert Mueller because he knows he'll crack under the pressure, and so afraid to go out in public, he hides out at his own golf clubs.
Oh, and one more thing. @realDonaldTrump likes to pretend he’s a real tough guy. But like most bullies, he sure scares easy, doesn’t he?
And @realDonaldTrump loves playing the strong, decisive leader – but look at the chaos on his own staff, the way his administration fumbled the Puerto Rico recovery, or how he constantly undermines his own agenda with his own incompetence.
He drapes himself in the flag – but for all his talk about "Making America Great Again," all @realDonaldTrump does is attack our core values (the free press, the democratic process, our legacy of diversity) while he shovels taxpayer cash into his own pockets.
He demands military parades in his honor but cheats our veterans out of charitable donations, attacks their families, ducked out of Vietnam, &amp; can't even be bothered to visit the troops that he refuses to bring home from Afghanistan or Iraq.
He pretends to love law enforcement – but attacks his own Justice Dept, attacks the American hero who led the FBI after 9/11 for doing his job, &amp; stuffs his Admin with crooks who bend over backwards to make sure no CEO ever goes to jail for cheating people.
He promised to #draintheswamp – but @realDonaldTrump is the most corrupt President in American history. The long line of scandals &amp; convictions (Pruitt, Price, Manafort, Cohen, etc.) prove it. Art of the Deal? More like Art of the Plea Deal.
He pretends he’s a populist – but @realDonaldTrump’s economic policies are all about making the rich richer and the powerful more powerful. He’s stuffed his administration with so many former Goldman Sachs bankers they could open a branch office.
We knew all that before @realDonaldTrump became President. But since he took office, we’ve learned that the scam runs even deeper.
And @realDonaldTrump brags about being a successful businessman – but he’s only good at going bust (he even lost money with a casino!) and cheating people: scamming Trump U students, shortchanging workers and contractors, &amp; abusing bankruptcy laws to save his own skin.
For starters, @realDonaldTrump wants us to think he’s a billionaire – but he won’t show us his tax returns. Why? Maybe he isn’t as rich as he pretends, &amp; he doesn’t want us to know that his "empire" is really built on debts he owes to some sketchy characters.
If @realDonaldTrump – a cowardly elitist who has never known or cared what life is like for anyone who's ever lived outside of a skyscraper in Manhattan – wants to talk about authenticity, well then, let's talk about who's REALLY pretending to be someone they're not.
Speaking of family stories, @realDonaldTrump has one, too. It's the story of a second-generation tax cheat who was handed a $413 million inheritance through rich-guy loopholes and outright criminal fraud. https://t.co/ZHJIm4GQG3
I won't sit quietly for @realDonaldTrump's racism, so I took a test. But DNA &amp; family history has nothing to do with tribal affiliation or citizenship, which is determined only – only – by Tribal Nations. I respect the distinction, &amp; don't list myself as Native in the Senate.
Bottom line: My heritage played no role in my hiring – ever. The @BostonGlobe reviewed all the evidence. Their verdict? "At every step of her remarkable rise in the legal profession, the people responsible for hiring her saw her as a white woman." https://t.co/LTQ6d1sMwM
We all know why @realDonaldTrump makes creepy physical threats about me, right? He’s scared. He’s trying to do what he always does to women who scare him: call us names, attack us personally, shrink us down to feel better about himself. It may soothe his ego – but it won’t work. https://t.co/2rfPSlvlQA

NIWRC is a nonprofit working to protect Native women from violence. More than half of all Native women have experienced sexual violence, and the majority of violent crimes against Native Americans are perpetrated by non-Natives.	   	Send them your $1M check, @realDonaldTrump.

When @BetsyDeVosED tried to roll back the new protections for students cheated by for-profit colleges, Massachusetts took her to court. And guess what? Earlier this month, we won. We’ll keep fighting for our students — here in Massachusetts and across the country. https://t.co/uX0Sy1vh3k

There are some men who can only hear “blah blah blah” whenever a woman’s talking. But there’s nothing impolite about people’s right to speak out and hold their government accountable. And sometimes, people are right to be angry.
Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump can’t shut me up – and neither can John Kelly. (He can’t even get @realDonaldTrump off Twitter, and as far as I can tell, that was his main job description when he took on the role of @WhiteHouse Chief of Staff).
Was I tough on John Kelly in that phone call? You bet I was. Apparently he thought I was an “impolite arrogant woman.” “Blah blah blah” – that’s all he had to say when he was called out for breaking the law and destroying lives.
Before we got off the phone, I gave John Kelly something back for his troubles: a message on behalf of the American people that it was time to follow the court order and allow people stranded abroad to board planes into Logan Airport.
I asked John Kelly for an office number I could use in the future to reach him more quickly. He tried to give me the main line listed on @DHSgov’s website (really). Let’s just say I persisted longer than he did – and eventually I got his cell phone number.
There was only 1 problem: the new @DHSgov Secretary John Kelly wouldn’t return my calls. When I finally got him on the phone, he bizarrely insisted I made the whole thing up &amp; we’d never tried to reach him in the first place. So I read him all the emails between our staffs.
Remember when @realDonaldTrump launched the illegal, bigoted Muslim ban? People were being illegally detained – a direct and flagrant violation of court orders. So my office tried to get answers from @DHSgov about families who couldn’t get home to Logan. https://t.co/E1uwUN7Qmf

Hey @realDonaldTrump, hope you’re having fun at your rally. Too bad you’re the least popular incumbent president in modern history. And in the meantime, we are coming for your pathetic rubber-stamp Republicans in Congress in 31 days.

So please take some deep breaths – &amp; get ready to fight back. Take your	anger with you to the voting booth. Take it with you to knock on doors, make	phone calls, &amp; be a part of this grassroots army.		Turn your pain into power.		November 6th is just 31 days away. Here we come.
We won’t always win when we fight. But if we don’t put up a fight, we’ll always lose.
We called out powerful men who use their privilege to protect each other. We lifted the voices of sexual assault survivors. And we strengthened our bonds for the next fight. Because there will be a next fight, and another fight after that, and another fight after that.
I don’t like to lose – and this one really hurts – but I’m not sorry I got in this fight. Because here’s the deal: When we fight, we get stronger. It doesn’t drain our batteries. It builds up our muscles. And this was a righteous fight.
Today’s vote hurts people. It hurts every victim of sexual assault who’s been ignored, every woman who’s been told to be quiet, every person who’ll be on the losing end when Brett Kavanaugh casts a gut-punching deciding vote.
Just before the vote, I thanked, hugged and consoled the hundreds of people who were still outside the Capitol and Supreme Court. Women who have relived the worst moments of their lives these past few weeks, and fought with courage for the millions who could not be here.
Remember: Even the fights we lose matter. If we keep fighting, we can turn our anger &amp; pain into power. So to the Republicans &amp; @realDonaldTrump: listen up. 		32 days until Election Day. Exactly one month.		Tick, tock.
What’s next? We can't give up. We’re owning our anger – on behalf of women told to sit down &amp; shut up. On behalf of African Americans, Latinos, LGBTQ Americans, Native Americans, students, seniors – everyone who gets shut out of power by men who don’t know how to share.
I’m not going to sugarcoat anything. We lost a tough fight. And it hurts. What happened today will touch every single person in this country, in some very real &amp; terrible ways. But it’s OK to step back for a minute, take a breath, &amp; lean on the shoulder of someone you love.

It’s not just Brett Kavanaugh. @realdonaldtrump is packing the federal courts with unqualified extremists – and Mitch McConnell lets it happen. Democrats have got to take back the Senate to stop Trump’s judges. And that means you’ve got to vote. https://t.co/csNmYjuGv0

The same right-wing groups that pre-approved Brett Kavanaugh are dumping millions of dollars into anonymous ads to save his nomination. This process is a joke – and when the American people say they are angry, they’re right to be angry. #StopKavanaugh https://t.co/CijwMMiiGs

Nobody in this country got rich on their own – no one. Especially not someone who probably committed tax fraud &amp; got $413M from his father &amp; his morally bankrupt real estate empire.		Are you going to talk about that at your rally tonight, @realDonaldTrump? https://t.co/ZHJIm4GQG3

Too many people are crushed by student loans, &amp; we've got to keep fighting for them. That's why we secured $700M for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, including an additional $350M in last week's spending bill. When we invest in students, we invest in our future. https://t.co/zSov3j2qk9
PSLF was created to help teachers &amp; other public servants from getting crushed by student loan debt. But 99% of borrowers who applied to the program were rejected under @BetsyDeVosED's watch, &amp; many who think they’re enrolled get placed in the wrong one. https://t.co/u5HD9IpbL0

Brett Kavanaugh was allowed to be angry. Dr. Ford wasn’t. Women grow up hearing that being angry makes us unattractive. Well, today, I’m angry – and I own it. I plan to use that anger to take back the House, take back the Senate, &amp; put Democrats in charge. Are you with me? https://t.co/c9DebKTQEV
It’s time for women to go to Washington &amp; fix our broken gov't. That includes a woman at the top.

We believe &amp; stand with Dr. Ford. This isn’t over yet. Senator Jeff Flake has called for a one-week delay to allow for an FBI investigation. We’ll fight tooth and nail on the Senate floor to stop Brett Kavanaugh from a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court. https://t.co/YY8clYefSk
So many women identify with the trauma Dr. Ford has dealt with all her life. That’s one of many reasons why her testimony yesterday was so powerful. She’s a hero – brave, compelling, credible. We stand with her, and with all survivors of sexual assault. https://t.co/vf4nR0a35f
We're all angry. Use it. Now is the time to do whatever you can do to speak out against Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court. https://t.co/4taCHo635J

This isn’t about politics – this is about the safety of our children, the national security of our nation, and the future of our democracy. Tell the cabinet: if Trump is unfit, invoke the 25th. https://t.co/Ser3UrbUaB
If senior officials believe the president is unfit, they should stop hiding behind anonymous op-eds and leaking info to Bob Woodward, and do what the Constitution demands they do: invoke the 25th Amendment and remove this president from office.
Let’s be clear: We already have a constitutional crisis if the cabinet believes the President of the United States can’t do his job and then refuses to follow the rules that have been laid down in the Constitution. They can’t have it both ways.
.@realDonaldTrump shouldn’t be able to stick someone on the Supreme Court who’d have his back if he gets into serious legal trouble. Republicans and Democrats in the Senate need to defend the rule of law. #StopKavanaugh

Seriously? The Republicans have a secret list of things that @realDonaldTrump and his corrupt administration have done — from "hacking attempts" to "tax returns." They don't want to #EndCorruptionNow — they want to cover it up. https://t.co/K7kdairXi4
It's time to bring lobbying out into the sunlight — disclose all the meetings and all the documents changing hands. If you agree, sign our petition and demand Congress pass the Anti-Corruption Act. https://t.co/FaK9rJT0PI
In my new bill, we're fixing the Swiss cheese definition of "lobbyist" — and requiring everyone who gets paid to influence Washington to register. #EndCorruptionNow
Corporate lobbyists have run the show in Washington for way too long. I’ve got a new plan to end lobbying as we know it. #EndCorruptionNow https://t.co/7p7GJ9zWN9
My friend @RichCordray took on the Wall St billionaires &amp; held them accountable when he ran the @CFPB. Your friends are on their way to jail for corruption. I can see why you’re scared of him, @realDonaldTrump. I would be too if I were you.
And government officials shouldn’t be able to use their public service to pad their private fortunes. Our new Anti-Corruption Act will make government work for the people. #EndCorruptionNow https://t.co/FaK9rJT0PI
Unless we require Presidential candidates to release their tax returns, we won’t know if the President is profiting from policy decisions – or if they’re vulnerable to financial blackmail from a hostile foreign power.
You shouldn’t be able to serve as President (or any federally elected office) without releasing your tax returns – looking at you, @realdonaldtrump. My Anti-Corruption Act will fix this.
This makes me sick to my stomach. We need to pass gun reform laws to keep our kids safe, and invest in education to open doors for their future — not use taxpayer money to arm our teachers. @BetsyDeVosED is the worst Education Secretary ever. https://t.co/vdFICrPDb5
Let’s ban federal elected &amp; top appointed officials from becoming lobbyists after they leave office. Not for one year. Not for two years. For the rest of their lives. It’s all part of our new bill to #EndCorruptionNow. Sign the petition: https://t.co/FaK9rJT0PI
In Washington, the government-to-lobbying revolving door spins so fast that it could make you dizzy. The Anti-Corruption Act puts a padlock on that door, and reins in the lobbyists.
My new bill would end business-as-usual in Washington and rip corruption out by the roots. Here's what I want you to know about the Anti-Corruption Act.

The Trump Administration designated Port Isabel as "the primary family reunification and removal center for adults" in ICE custody. I just visited, and let's be clear – this is a detention facility, not a reunification center.

The groups that are working on-the-ground to help immigrant kids &amp; families still need our help – now more than ever. Anything you’re able to give to support their work will make a real difference. https://t.co/dPVsZWEC3t
Thousands of kids have already been ripped from their parents &amp; there's no plan to reunite them. And @realDonaldTrump’s big solution is to create new detention camps for families. The official US policy can’t just be to throw more people in cages indefinitely.
For weeks, the American people have spoken out against @realDonaldTrump’s cruel &amp; inhumane policy of separating immigrant families. And today, Trump announced that he would end his policy. But let’s just be clear: this isn’t over.

.@CardinalSean is right. Tearing children away from their families is cruel and unconscionable — and goes against everything our country stands for. #FamiliesBelongTogether #EndFamilySeparation	https://t.co/GX6XE7xJAf
I spoke to @TelemundoNI about families being separated at the border. It's cruel, scary, inhumane and shameful. I don't understand how the US government &amp; @realdonaldtrump could do this to children. https://t.co/LbGEPQvkqz
Today, I'm thinking about the 49 loved ones ripped from their families and friends at #Pulse two years ago. We remember them, and we #HonorThemWithAction when we fight to prevent gun violence &amp; ensure that every LGBTQ+ person is safe to be who they are.

Today I announced at #CAPIdeas that I’m sending $175,000 to organizations working to win back state legislatures and fight for fair redistricting. We all need to do our part. https://t.co/kHxUK2uLg1
Democrats believe in a fair fight, and making sure that districts aren’t drawn to cut out one party or the other is a critical first step. Voting is the beating heart of a democracy. We can do this – and we must. #CAPIdeas
In March, I sent $5k to all 50 state parties to help them hire organizers &amp; register voters. Now I’m doubling down by sending $175,000 to organizations on the front lines trying to win back state legislatures &amp; fight for fair redistricting. #CAPIdeas
We need to stand up against voter suppression efforts like racist voter ID laws &amp; early voting restrictions. We need to make it easier to register &amp; vote – from automatic registration to felon re-enfranchisement. And we need to put an end to partisan gerrymandering. #CAPIdeas
Democracy hangs on the idea that those who get the most votes wins. Politicians are supposed to compete over how many voters they can persuade, not how many they can disqualify or demoralize. #CAPIdeas

It is up to us to answer Dr. King’s charge to make the American Dream a reality, to make real the promises of democracy. Not just for wealthy &amp; the powerful, but for all people, for the least of these. #MLK50
We will say, loud and clear, that #blacklivesmatter. And when a racist bully uses hateful rhetoric to divide our country &amp; push discrimination in America, you better believe we will fight back. #MLK50
We will fight to end voter suppression. Fight for working families &amp; economic justice. Fight to end the epidemic of mass incarceration. Fight to protect Dreamers &amp; those with temporary protected status. #MLK50
50 years after Dr. King was gunned down, we face another moment of challenge. We must meet those challenges, not only with a good heart, but with a determination to take action &amp; an unshakable faith that we will overcome. #MLK50
So they sat-in where they were told they didn’t belong. They stood up when they were told they should cower. They marched where they were told they could not go. They rode. Voted. Ran for office. Spoke out. They lifted their voices until the entire nation heard them. #MLK50
Dr. King &amp; countless other unsung heroes of the movement were engaged in an all out fight to create an America that lived up to its ideals. An America that fought for the least of these. #MLK50
Teachers in OK, KY, WV, &amp; all across the country change the lives of little girls and boys every day. They deserve our respect &amp; support. I stand in solidarity with those teachers who are fighting to support their families &amp; invest in their students. Their fight is our fight.
Things look very different now. Many teachers work 2 or 3 jobs before &amp; after school &amp; weekends to make ends meet. They struggle to teach while their school’s funding plummets year after year. They use their own money to buy basic school supplies or help out their students.
There were a lot of bumps along the way, but I never gave up my dream of becoming a teacher. I’m the daughter of a maintenance man who became a teacher, a professor, &amp; a US Senator because America invested in kids like me &amp; in great teachers like Mrs. Lee.
One day Mrs. Lee took me aside to explain that if I worked hard, I could become a teacher, too – and it changed my whole world. No one in my family had graduated from college. But when Mrs. Lee said, “Yes, Miss Betsy, you can,” I saw myself in a different way.
I loved my 2nd grade teacher. From the 1st day I walked into Mrs. Lee’s classroom at Wilson Elementary School in Norman, Oklahoma, I knew she was special. She gave the best hugs ever. Like great teachers everywhere, she opened up new possibilities for every one of her students.

No amount of pressure on the industry can substitute action by Congress – and I’m going to keep fighting until we pass common sense gun reform. But every change is important. Engaging investors is one way we can start. #YouFundGuns
Today we launched #YouFundGuns – an easy website to help you call or tweet at the country’s biggest investment firms. Urge them to use their leverage as shareholders in gun companies to help reduce gun violence. https://t.co/TdHeLno8FV
Shareholders hold the reins in any public company. Money talks. But for the most part, the investment firms haven’t had the political courage to step up and lead this fight to stop gun violence. #YouFundGuns
Last month, I sent letters to 9 of the country’s biggest investment firms – all major shareholders in gun companies. I asked them to use their financial muscle to push for more responsible behavior by gun manufacturers. #YouFundGuns

Right now, the @NewYorkFed President is being replaced. It's one of the most important economic jobs in America that @realDonaldTrump doesn’t control. We need someone in the job who will work for the American people, not for Wall Street. #10YearsAfter
Some people in Washington seem to have forgotten the 2008 financial crisis, but the millions of people who lost their jobs, homes, and life savings haven’t. #10YearsAfter
10 years ago this week, Bear Stearns was the 1st financial giant to collapse. The @NewYorkFed rescued Bear Stearns by negotiating its sale to @JPMorgan – but it was too late to stop the worst crash since the Great Depression. #10YearsAfter
But @realDonaldTrump is right - I am angry, and so are a lot of Americans. Angry because his corrupt cronies control the levers of government to help their billionaire buddies. Angry because DC kicks dirt in the teeth of working people time and time again. We've had enough of it.
The majority of violent crimes experienced by Native Americans are perpetrated by non-Natives, and more than half of Native women have experienced sexual violence. I wish @realDonaldTrump and his Admin would focus on that rather than making Native people the butt of a joke.
I can't force @realDonaldTrump to respect Native Americans. Or to read his intelligence briefings. Or to take seriously threats to our security. Or to stop defending domestic abusers and white supremacists. Or to stop sucking up to Wall Street and sticking it to workers.

Wayne LaPierre can call me whatever he wants. He doesn’t scare me. You know what scares Wayne LaPierre? That people will lift their voices &amp; demand action. That his name-calling &amp; bullying won’t work anymore.
We won’t stop fighting to ban assault weapons. We won’t stop fighting for background checks. We’re going to fight so kids can to go to school without worrying they might get shot &amp; killed in their classroom.
The @NRA has been working round the clock since Parkland to stop common-sense gun reform. Including, it seems, bullying those of us who side with students over gun lobbyists. It’s disgusting, but it’s not going to shut us up.
I don’t want the support of a radical extremist who puts the profits of the gun industry before the safety of our children in Massachusetts &amp; across the country.
Wayne LaPierre – the head of the @NRA – gave a big speech today &amp; made it clear that he isn’t a fan of mine. And you know what? That’s perfectly fine by me. The feeling is mutual.
Kids like Allie give me hope. They’re smart, passionate and unafraid to ask big questions. Thanks for the great question, Allie. Keep holding signs, knocking on doors and speaking up. We’re ready to hear your voice. https://t.co/AJ93gKF8rw

Former @CFPB Director @RichCordray is right: No matter how much @realDonaldTrump &amp; his team of billionaires &amp; bankers try to gut the consumer agency, they won’t stop it from working to level the playing field for American families. https://t.co/vdNm0UJjmd
I hope you’ll watch my entire remarks to the National Congress of American Indians’ Executive Council Winter Session. This is a story that needs to be heard. https://t.co/Rysw5Bz15b  @NCAI1944 #ECWS2018
And today I made a promise to @NCAI1944 tribal leaders: Every time someone brings up my family’s story, I’m going to use it to lift up the story of their families &amp; communities. Read my full remarks here. https://t.co/385viifuyY #ECWS2018
I also told the story of my parents, because they were real people too. The love they shared, the struggles they endured, the family they built, &amp; the story they lived will always be a part of me. No one – not even the President – will ever take that part of me away. #ECWS2018
I’ve noticed that when my name comes up, @realDonaldTrump likes to talk about Pocahontas. So I figured, let’s talk about Pocahontas. Not the tale that's been twisted for centuries – but the real Pocahontas, and her story of heroism. And bravery. And pain. @NCAI1944 #ECWS2018
I was honored to speak this morning at the National Congress of American Indians’ Executive Council Winter Session &amp; Tribal Nations Policy Summit. @NCAI1944 #ECWS2018 https://t.co/iDrFAJhSEs

The character of our country – and the state of our union – isn’t determined by our President. It’s determined by our people. Now more than ever, we’re in this fight all the way. #SOTU
America isn’t prouder when @realDonaldTrump embraces bigotry, hatred &amp; fear – &amp; calls that patriotism. #SOTU
America’s economy isn’t safer when @realDonaldTrump rolls back the rules on Wall Street to let the big banks gamble with our economy again. #SOTU
America isn’t safer when @realDonaldTrump alienates our allies, plays a stupid, reckless game of chicken with a dangerous foreign power, &amp; threatens nuclear war. #SOTU
America’s moral fabric isn’t stronger when @realDonaldTrump breaks our promise to 800,000 Dreamers. #SOTU
America’s future isn’t stronger when @realDonaldTrump gives away gigantic tax breaks to billionaires &amp; giant corporations so there’s no money for education, infrastructure, &amp; the tools we need to succeed.
Let’s be clear: America isn’t stronger when @realDonaldTrump tries to rip health care away from millions of Americans. #SOTU
I went to the #SOTU. I wanted it burned into my eyes. If there’s ever a moment when I’m too tired to keep fighting, I just have to close my eyes &amp; see @realDonaldTrump , @mike_pence &amp; @pryan applauding themselves for punching working families in the gut, &amp; I'm back in this fight.

We have a battle coming in Massachusetts in 2018. Billionaire Breitbart donor Robert Mercer started funding nasty attack ads against me months ago. @realDonaldTrump is tweeting his socks off to beat us next November. I’m not taking anything for granted.

I call on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to listen to the people of Alabama and seat @GDouglasJones without any delay.
We can’t stop now. The 2018 elections are less than a year away. We must invest in campaigns across the country. We must take a stand against the hateful ideologies that have been making their way back into our country’s highest offices. And we must fight harder than ever before.
If we take away 1 more lesson from Alabama, it’s this: Dems can win in every district &amp; state across the country. So we need to fight harder than ever to recruit, support, &amp; elect candidates &amp; compete in every election.
Tonight Alabama is sending a powerful message across the country. The American people will fight back against bigotry, hate &amp;, yes, pedophilia – &amp; reject a man totally unfit to serve in the US Senate. Republican, Democrat, Independent – on this, there will be no compromise.
We elected a Democrat in deep red Alabama tonight. Why? Because @GDouglasJones was a great candidate. We had the right message. We had the wind in our sails. And we fought our hearts out.
The Trump Administration is on a mission to destroy the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. We can whimper, we can whine, or we can fight back. #CFPB https://t.co/p19vlwtV5S
It’s just not okay. No person should fear losing their life for their gender identity or expression in the US in 2017. Today we remember – but we also fight back for trans rights &amp; protections here &amp; around the world. #TDOR https://t.co/5F41RdOit2
25 trans people have been murdered in the US in 2017 – the highest number ever recorded. Most are women of color. And every day, transgender Americans face housing, employment &amp; healthcare discrimination. #TDOR

Read my @washingtonpost op-ed about how @realDonaldTrump didn’t invent the “rigged election” myth. The @GOP did: https://t.co/ay6gF6YKqZ
And @realDonaldTrump’s antics – like attacking judges &amp; calling for his opponent’s imprisonment – echo the @HouseGOP’s witch hunts.
It’s fascinating, @realDonaldTrump: “voter fraud” only seems to plague places where lots of people might vote for @TheDemocrats.
But @realDonaldTrump didn’t come up with the “rigged” election himself. It’s a longtime effort by the @GOP to delegitimize @TheDemocrats.
It's not rigged, @realDonaldTrump. You're losing fair &amp; square. Put on your big-boy pants because this is what accountability looks like.
You can’t run a campaign based on hating women, African Americans, Muslims &amp; immigrants &amp; expect to win, @realDonaldTrump.
Anyone with children knows that whining about imaginary cheating is the last refuge of the sore loser, @realDonaldTrump.
Give me a break, @realDonaldTrump. You’re not losing because it’s rigged. You’re losing because we see through your creepy bullying.

If the @SenateGOP don't have the backbone to stand up to @realDonaldTrump, they don't have the backbone to stand up for working families.
You can't walk this back, @SenateGOP: Can't support @realDonaldTrump's agenda, say you're voting for him, then pretend to shake your finger.
Four hours later - after massive public outcry &amp; widespread condemnation - Kelly Ayotte asked for a do-over. Sorry. That's not leadership.
Think about it: @realDonaldTrump calls Latinos rapists, African Americans thugs, &amp; women fat pigs, &amp; Kelly Ayotte thinks he's a role model.
Yesterday in the #NHSen debate, Republican Kelly Ayotte said @realDonaldTrump is "absolutely" a role model for kids. https://t.co/d7uAXtGNWt
I join a very grateful #RedSox Nation today in saying: #ThanksPapi @davidortiz!
A thin-skinned bully who thinks humiliating women at 3am qualifies him to be President does not understand America &amp; is not fit to lead.
Nope, @realDonaldTrump: the only things that keep your mind racing at night are your next racist, sexist tweets &amp; disgusting lies.
You never tweet at 3am with ways to create new jobs for workers or hold Wall Street accountable, @realDonaldTrump.
You never tweet at 3am with ways to help students getting crushed by debt or seniors struggling on Social Security, @realDonaldTrump.
Is this what keeps you up at night, @realDonaldTrump? Thinking of new &amp; interesting ways to call women fat or ugly or sluts?
.@HillaryClinton was prepared for the debate &amp; she’s prepared for the presidency. @realDonaldTrump only prepared lies &amp; conspiracy theories.
The man who was ranting &amp; raving on stage tonight has no business controlling our economy OR our nuclear codes. #debatenight
.@realDonaldTrump’s economic plan? Cut taxes for billionaires &amp; the rules on Wall Street, &amp; leave working families behind. #debatenight

Join Dems in calling on @SpeakerRyan &amp; @SenateMajLdr to bring back Congress to pass a clean #Zika bill: https://t.co/DkiLuDQtCA
Every day the GOP stalls funding #Zika response, more people get sick. More babies risk being born with heartbreaking head deformities.
When a reporter asked @SenateMajLdr why he wouldn’t pass a clean #Zika bill, he said that’s just the way things are done in Washington.
I didn’t think the @HouseGOP could pass 1 bill to hurt women, vets, Obamacare, @PPFA &amp; clean water all at once, but their #Zika bill did it.
The last @HouseGOP #Zika bill – jammed thru at 3am during #nobillnobreak – was a pathetic, dishonest, malicious bill loaded w/ poison pills.
#Zika is a public health emergency, but the @HouseGOP &amp; @SenateGOP have no plans to do anything before Labor Day.
Woo-hoo! Congrats to Needham's own @Aly_Raisman &amp; the entire @USAGym women's team! We're so proud of you! #USA #Rio2016
Your reckless comments sound like a two-bit dictator, @realDonaldTrump. Not a man who wants to lead the greatest democracy on the planet.
.@realDonaldTrump makes death threats because he's a pathetic coward who can’t handle the fact that he’s losing to a girl.
The American people aren’t dumb, @realDonaldTrump. We don’t trust you with our nuclear codes AND we don’t trust you with our economy.
.@realDonaldTrump's economics plan is all about helping rich guys like Donald Trump get richer – &amp; leaving everyone else behind.
Even @realDonaldTrump's childcare plan gives billionaires w/ a nanny a tax break while millions of low-income households get nothing.
And taxes? @realDonaldTrump wants billionaires &amp; giant corps to pay EVEN LESS – so there’s less money for ed, infrastructure &amp; research.
Cheating customers &amp; gaming the system might be your business, @realDonaldTrump, but it’s not the way America is going to do business.
Trump gets advice from Bear Stearns' fmr chief economist. So @realDonaldTrump: did BS need FEWER regs when they helped crash our economy?
W/o rules, @realDonaldTrump, too many huge banks juiced profits by cheating ppl on mortgages, credit cards, etc, then crashed our economy.
A “moratorium” on agency regulations means stopping new rules on shady payday lenders &amp; too-big-to-fail banks, @realDonaldTrump.
“Cut regulations massively,” @realDonaldTrump? No rules &amp; no accountability means people get ripped off &amp; markets blow up. Remember 2008?
.@realDonaldTrump's econ plan was written by rich corporate insider advisors to make the economy even greater for rich corporate insiders.

.@timkaine started his career helping families fight housing discrimination. That’s because Tim has always had a good heart.
During the 2008 crash, Latino families were 71% more likely to lose their homes. Lenders paid millions in fines for this “racial surtax.”

Don't forget: Tonight I'll be talking about @realDonaldTrump's speech live on @colbertlateshow. Tune in.  #ColbertRNC #lssc #RNCinCLE
The @CFPB has forced the big banks to return $11.7B directly to people who have been cheated. That's gov that works for the people!
The financial industry HATED the @CFPB, but we fought back &amp; won. Today we celebrate the 5-yr anniv of that little agency opening its doors.
One thing we definitely got right in Dodd-Frank was the @CFPB. Wall St can't cheat people on mortgages, credit cards &amp; student loans.
Dodd-Frank wasn’t perfect – we still have more work to do to make sure the big banks don’t bring down our economy again.
6 yrs ago today, @BarackObama signed Dodd-Frank, the Wall St reform bill that was a powerful step towards holding the big banks accountable.

It might blow your mind that a woman worked hard &amp; earned a good job on her own, @realDonaldTrump, but it’s not the 1800s. It happens.
Pres Reagan's Solicitor General was the Harvard prof who hired me, @realDonaldTrump. He says your right-wing conspiracy theories are a lie.
Nasty name-calling &amp; lies about my family aren’t going to shut me up, @realDonaldTrump. Is that really all you’ve got?
Terrifying to think of @mike_pence being a heartbeat from presidency – but the direction @GOP wants to take our country is MORE terrifying.
The @GOP platform even says that children not from “natural marriage” are more likely to be drug addicts. Hateful AND disgusting.
The @GOP platform says overturn marriage equality &amp; it supports parents putting their LGBT children through conversion therapy. Disgusting.
And OF COURSE @realDonaldTrump – a guy who “[doesn’t] feel good” about marriage equality – picked a VP famous for LGBT discrimination.
The @GOP platform is the most anti-choice ever: defund @PPFA &amp; denounce all abortion. Even cases of rape, incest &amp; woman's potential death.
What's worse? @realDonaldTrump &amp; @mike_pence’s sexism isn’t some radical fringe of the @GOP. They're in line with the party platform.
Of COURSE @realDonaldTrump – a guy who calls women fat pigs &amp; bimbos – picked a VP who is famous for trying to control women’s bodies.
.@realDonaldTrump &amp; @mike_pence are a perfect match: Two small, insecure, weak men who use hate &amp; fear to divide our country &amp; our people.

We honor those who have served our nation with courage – on Memorial Day &amp; every other day too. https://t.co/43ZVncwfja
If @realDonaldTrump means my job at Harvard, he can ask Charles Fried, Solicitor General for Reagan. He says loud &amp; clear that’s a lie.
Get your facts straight, @realDonaldTrump.  I didn’t even go to Harvard – I’m a graduate of @UHouston and @RutgersU.
Fling as much mud as you want, @realDonaldTrump. Your words &amp; actions disqualify you from being President - &amp; I won't stop saying it.
I fight for working families every day, @realDonaldTrump. You fight only for Donald Trump.
Anytime someone calls out @realDonaldTrump, he replies with right-wing conspiracies &amp; lies. It’s not presidential - &amp; getting very old.
If @realDonaldTrump actually believes every stupid lie he reads on the Internet, we’re in for a truckload of trouble if he’s President.
.@realDonaldTrump: I helped family buy their homes and out-of-work construction worker relatives make a living. I’m proud of that.
Explain why you don’t pay taxes that our country needs to keep us safe, @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/5tpKNIjVdt
Explain why you want to let Wall Street off the hook, @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/5tpKNIjVdt
Watch this video, @realDonaldTrump. Explain why you root for working people to fail. https://t.co/5tpKNIjVdt
Tonight I called out @realDonaldTrump in not-so-subtle terms. Watch this. https://t.co/5tpKNIjVdt
.@RealDonaldTrump trolls for votes &amp; wants working ppl to believe he's for them. News flash, Donald: working ppl are smarter than you think.
.@realDonaldTrump made clear he would abolish the federal minimum wage. One of a million reasons why working ppl can't make him the boss.
.@realDonaldTrump got destroyed on his min wage position. I was right when I called him out. https://t.co/ZCZXNGzUnb https://t.co/l7WG2CjuHJ
I worked with @KamalaHarris -- she's tough, principled &amp; fearless. Happy to support her campaign!  https://t.co/jfloN6wyii
.@realDonaldTrump can’t talk about Wall St, college costs or min wage, so he spent all day belching insults. Pathetic. Really pathetic.
.@realDonaldTrump: Your policies are dangerous. Your words are reckless. Your record is embarrassing. And your free ride is over.
When asked what gov should stop doing, @realDonaldTrump said overseeing banks! How can you be tough on Wall Street by letting them off?
You're so concerned about Wall Street, @realDonaldTrump, that you say you’d “absolutely” repeal Dodd-Frank?
You feel so much for people with college debt, @realDonaldTrump, that you raked in millions scamming students with Trump University?
You care so much about struggling American workers, @realDonaldTrump, that you want to abolish the federal minimum wage?
Do you think you're going to shut us up, @realDonaldTrump? Think again. It's time to answer for your dangerous ideas.
We get it, @realDonaldTrump: When a woman stands up to you, you’re going to call her a basket case. Hormonal. Ugly.
No, @realDonaldTrump - your racism, sexism &amp; xenophobia doesn't drive me nuts. It makes me sick. And I'm not alone.
Whatever @realDonaldTrump says, we won't shut up. We won't back down. This election is too important, &amp; he won’t step foot in White House.
.@realDonaldTrump lied his way through the primaries without being held accountable. That’s over.
The @GOP's hate-filled lies didn’t scare me before, @realDonaldTrump. And they don't scare me now.
If you think recycling Scott Brown's hate-filled attacks on my family is going to shut me up, @realDonaldTrump, think again buddy. Weak.
But here's the thing. You can beat a bully -- not by tucking tail and running, but by holding your ground.
.@realDonaldTrump spews insults and lies because he can’t have an honest conversation about his dangerous vision for America.
.@realdonaldtrump is a bully who has a single play in his playbook -- offensive lies thrown at anyone who calls him out.
We saw when Scott Brown attacked my family &amp; his staff made tomahawk chops &amp; war whoops. They lost big. MA voters knew better.
We saw what happened when birthers like @realDonaldTrump attacked @BarackObama. They lost big. American voters knew better.
“Goofy,” @realDonaldTrump? For a guy with "the best words" that’s a pretty lame nickname. Weak!
I called out @realDonaldTrump on Tuesday. 45 million saw it. He's so confident about his "counter punch" he waited until Friday night. Lame.
I'm going to fight my heart out to make sure @realDonaldTrump’s toxic stew of hatred &amp; insecurity never reaches the White House.
It will determine whether we move forward as one nation or splinter at the hands of one man's narcissism and divisiveness.
What happens next will test the character for all of us – Republican, Democrat, and Independent.
And @realDonaldTrump puts out out contradictory &amp; nonsensical national security ideas one expert called "incoherent" &amp; "truly bizarre."
@realDonaldTrump surrounds himself w/ foreign policy advisors who've been called a “collection of charlatans.”
.@realDonaldTrump attacks vets like @SenJohnMcCain who were captured &amp; puts our servicemembers at risk by cheerleading illegal torture.
.@realDonaldTrump incites supporters to violence, praises Putin, and is "cool with being called an authoritarian."
There's more enthusiasm for @realDonaldTrump among leaders of the KKK than leaders of the political party he now controls.
Here’s what else is real: @realDonaldTrump has built his campaign on racism, sexism, and xenophobia.
.@realDonaldTrump is now the leader of the @GOP. It's real - he is one step away from the White House.
We need @TammyforIL in the Senate - &amp; a Democratic majority - to fight for working families in IL &amp; across the country. #standwithTammy
Glad to join @TammyforIL in Chicago to discuss how she'll fight for seniors, vets &amp; disabled Americans in the Sen! https://t.co/1pacfVL0yQ
RT @TammyforIL: I'm so excited to have @elizabethforma in Chicago with me today! https://t.co/RNL6L1TgPf
Hey @TedCruz: Maybe you should spend less time complaining about your "significant sacrifices" - &amp; more time doing something about theirs.
You chose to run for President, @TedCruz. You chose to make your “sacrifices.” Working people don't have a choice.
They don't throw tantrums or try to shut down their workplace because they don't get their way - &amp; then turn around &amp; demand promotions.
And @TedCruz? Working people work more, get paid less, can't save, get mistreated, struggle with illness &amp; family - but they don't whine.
Know who’s facing "constant attacks," @TedCruz? Hardworking American immigrants, Muslims, LGBT folks, women. Your constant attacks.
Know who gets no family time, @TedCruz? Moms w/ unfair schedules who drop kids at daycare &amp; find their hrs cancelled. @GOP won't help.
Know who gets no personal time? People who work 2 min wage jobs to support their families. @TedCruz opposes giving them a raise.
Know whose sleep is limited? Working parents who stay up worrying about getting kids thru college w/o big debt. @TedCruz blocked #refi.
Know whose health is limited? Workers w/ no paid leave who can't stay home when sick or caring for kids. @TedCruz won't support it.
Are you kidding me, @TedCruz? We’re supposed to pity you because trying to be the leader of the free world is hard?! 2 words: Boo hoo.
.@TedCruz whined about facing constant attacks, nonexistent family time, limited health and sleep, and no personal time.
Yesterday @TedCruz sent a campaign email whining about the “significant sacrifice” he’s made to run for President. https://t.co/yKtLpWG0Ou
Does the front page of the @BostonGlobe Ideas section scare you? It should. https://t.co/Wml4jJZ0gv https://t.co/qBYbwPjSrF
Read my new @BostonGlobe op-ed telling @Senate_GOPs to #doyourjob. https://t.co/r0sTXpr1Aw
.@Senate_GOPs can start proving they can govern responsibly by doing their jobs &amp; considering @POTUS's nominee to the Supreme Court.
If the @Senate_GOPs don't like having to pick between Donald Trump &amp; Ted Cruz, they should stand up to extremists in their party.

We cannot elect wannabe tyrants to the White House. Not now, not ever. It’s up to all of us us to stop @realDonaldTrump .
.@RealDonaldTrump is “cool with being called an authoritarian,” isn't upset at Hitler comparisons &amp; thinks we won’t fight back? WRONG!
Why is it that @realDonaldTrump can call himself the “unity” candidate while basing his campaign on racism, sexism, xenophobia &amp; hatred?
The way I see it, it’s our job to make sure @realDonaldTrump ends this campaign every bit the loser that he started it.
Many of history’s worst authoritarians started out as losers – and @realDonaldTrump is a serious threat.
.@RealDonaldTrump stands ready to tear apart an America that was built on values like decency, community, and concern for our neighbors.
But just because @realDonaldTrump is a loser everywhere else doesn’t mean he’ll lose this election.
.@RealDonaldTrump knows he’s a loser. His insecurities are on parade: petty bullying, attacks on women, cheap racism, flagrant narcissism.
Listen to experts who say @realDonaldTrump might have more money today if he’d put his inheritance in an index fund &amp; left it alone.
See how @realDonaldTrump kept his father’s empire afloat using strategic corporate bankruptcies to skip out on debt.
Let’s be honest - @realDonaldTrump is a loser. Count all his failed businesses. See how he cheated people w/ scams like Trump U.
People ask me whether I regret my big decision, but it's too late: I'm here again at the #BostonStPats breakfast. https://t.co/jwYMF543fT

This is business as usual for Wall Street and Washington insiders, and it stinks.
Not sure what’s more disgusting: That Jeb is pinning his 2016 hopes on his bro’s bailout $, or that bailed-out CEOs want to buy elections.
And now, Greenberg is giving $10 million of his AIG fortune to try to save Jeb Bush’s dying Presidential campaign. https://t.co/buFLQUBaYR
Once his GOP friends left office, Greenberg sued the Obama Administration because – get this – the bailout wasn’t generous enough for him…
Hank Greenberg left his company just before AIG took a $182 billion bailout from the Bush Administration…
Let's get this straight: CEO Hank Greenberg ran AIG as it recklessly gambled on mortgage-backed securities...
I'm glad that ALL the Dem candidates for president – @HillaryClinton, @BernieSanders &amp; @MartinOMalley – are fighting for Wall St reform.
We need to level the playing field and end too big to fail.
I'm glad @BernieSanders is out there fighting to hold big banks accountable, make our economy safer, &amp; stop the GOP from rigging the system.
But the 2016 Republicans claim they'll repeal all the new financial regulations – hoping to be chosen as Wall Street's favorite candidate.
11 big banks are still so risky that if any one started to fail, they'd need a gov bailout or risk taking down the economy – again.
Took our granddaughter to the Boston @museumofscience today to catch their Pixar exhibit. Amazing – and fun! https://t.co/qnHTuY6VGY

I agree with @HillaryClinton: “President Obama &amp; congressional Democrats should do everything they can to stop these efforts.”
.@HillaryClinton is right to fight GOP efforts to sneak financial reform rollbacks into the funding bill. https://t.co/SyxC6L8tA0
So here's my message to Wall Street &amp; their GOP buddies: we're ready to fight back to protect the @CFPB. #GOPDebate
Wall Street knows if they soften @CFPB support, the GOP will feel better undercutting the agency in closed-door deals. #GOPDebate
Thousands of dollars on a TV ad is nothing compared to the money the big banks save if their GOP buddies go after the @CFPB. #GOPDebate
The @CFPB has forced the big financial companies to return more than $11B to people they cheated on credit cards, mortgages, etc. #GOPDebate
Wall Street has a problem: They know the @CFPB is working, &amp; it's incredibly popular with the families it helps. #GOPDebate
So... Can we talk about that ad that just ran during the #GOPDebate where I look like a Commie dictator?

If we're going to keep the Senate majority, we need Democratic women to vote, &amp; we need Democratic women candidates to win. #rallywomen
There’s so much at stake for women in 2 weeks. @emilyslist, @SenGillibrand &amp; I are doing our part – but we need you too. #rallywomen
We believe women shouldn’t have to ask their boss permission to get birth control, and we’re fighting to reverse Hobby Lobby. #rallywomen
I can't believe I have to say this in 2014: We believe in equal pay for equal work, and Democrats are fighting for it. #rallywomen
After a lifetime of work, you should be able to retire with dignity. Democrats are fighting for Social Security &amp; Medicare. #rallywomen
We believe you should be able to get an education without getting crushed by debt, and Democrats are fighting for it. #rallywomen
We believe no one who works full time should live in poverty, and Democrats are fighting to raise the minimum wage. #rallywomen
We can whimper, we can whine, or we can fight back by voting on Nov 4th. Me? I’m fighting back. #rallywomen
Yes, women have made incredible strides. But nobody’s going to say, “Women have arrived! Let’s just move over.” #rallywomen
Since women earn less over lifetime, they receive on avg $4k/yr less in Social Security – but they rely on the checks most. #rallywomen
2/3 of minimum wage workers are women, but the minimum wage no longer keeps a mom &amp; her baby out of poverty. #rallywomen
More young women are going to college than ever, but 71% of students graduate with crushing debt. #rallywomen
Bloomberg found women earn less in 99.6% of jobs, but women can still be fired for asking what the guy down the hall makes. #rallywomen
Today I’m joining @emilyslist &amp; @SenGillibrand to #rallywomen to vote on 11/4, because the deck is stacked against women most of all.

If you don't want anyone to talk about your votes, Senator Brown, you shouldn't have voted that way. #masen #mapoli
We can do a lot more than talk about Scott Brown's voting record - we can hold him accountable for it on Election Day. #masen #mapoli
Scott Brown voted for the Blunt amendment that could limit women's access to birth control. I'm going to keep talking about that. #masen
Scott Brown voted against equal pay for women. I'm going to keep talking about that. #masen #mapoli
Scott Brown voted against the Buffett Rule. I'm going to keep talking about that. #masen #mapoli

Women deserve equal pay for equal work. Today I spoke about paycheck fairness on @NowWithAlex. Watch here: http://t.co/EmkNCur0 #masen
I understand that Scott Brown wants to pretend Rep Akin is an isolated individual, but he's clearly in line with the GOP agenda. #masen
Scott Brown supports the Blunt amendment, opposes equal pay, endorses Paul Ryan &amp; works for a GOP majority in the Senate. #masen #mapoli
The Republican agenda is to select a VP nominee who co-sponsored legislation with Rep Akin to redefine “rape.” #masen #mapoli
The Republican agenda is to cut funding for Planned Parenthood. #masen #mapoli
The Republican agenda is to deny women equal pay for equal work. #masen #mapoli
The Republican agenda is to limit women’s access to health care services. #masen #mapoli

Scott Brown can’t run away from Romney, Ryan or the GOP. Together they'll help the rich &amp; powerful get richer &amp; more powerful #masen #mapoli
I support tax cuts for 98% of families &amp; 97% of small businesses. Brown held those cuts hostage for bigger cuts for millionaires #masen
I support health care tax credits for families &amp; small businesses. Brown pledged to repeal all health care reforms including the tax breaks.
I support the Buffett Rule so billionaires don't pay lower tax rates than the middle class. Brown voted against the Buffett Rule. #masen
I think Big Oil ought to pay their fair share. Scott Brown voted to protect subsidies for Big Oil. #masen #mapoli
Scott Brown's record on taxes is as clear as Romney's and Ryan's - help those at the top, tell everyone else to pick up the pieces #masen
