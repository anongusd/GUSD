The Leafs need about two scorers and maybe a goalie. I'm not sold on Gustavson, but I hope he proves me wrong against the Pens tonight!
Even if Toronto doesn't make the playoffs, the roster is full of young talent and there is depth in the minors (usually a chronic problem).
The Leafs have 8 NHL-ready D-men in the minors, major cap space, and are 2-0-0. Who doesn't like Brian Burke? This rebuild is amazing.
Leafs put Finger on waivers, opening up their cap space with plenty of prospects to deal. I'd say bring on a trade, but we're 2-0-0 people.
That's one more win than the Leafs had last October. Clearly the team is improved. #suckithabs

Georgia Tech within three with 1:26 left. The Yellow Jackets don't have any more timeouts, but Duke's frontcourt is in serious foul trouble.

There's some debate on press row if Duke's Smith has done enough to take #ACCTournament MVP from Singler. Ummm, no freaking way.
Singler just ran over ESPN's announcers and (well) almost Dan and I. My Mt. Dew can got crushed. Thank goodness it was empty.
I still remember Andre Dawkins and his braces at last year's NBA Top 100 camp. He's got Duke's last 7 points, including a great dunk!
Singler hits his first 3-pointer (and shot) with 8:52 left in the first half. The 20-14 #Duke lead feels a lot bigger than it really is.
Nolan Smith already has 11 points for #Duke. This is the best the Blue Devils offense has looked at this #ACCTournament.
#GTech better wake up quick. The Jackets looked dead tired yesterday against State. They won't have the energy for a big comeback.
#GTech has turned the ball over 5 times in the first 3 minutes. That's not going to get it done against #Duke. This will end with a whimper.
Some writers have called this the worst #acctourney they have ever covered. #duke, #gtech, lets get it on!
Gonzalez can't make up for his one big mistake. He misses two 3-pointers in the final 11.4 seconds, and #GTech wins 57-54.
Tempers boil over as Gonzalez gets called for an intentional foul. #NCState is imploding down the stretch, allowing #GTech to pull away.
The last time these two teams met, Mays missed a shot at the buzzer to allow #GTech to escape with the win. Will history repeat itself?
A close game with 3:27 left, #NCState hasn't been here before in this tournament (sarcasm alert!) This one is going to the wire.
#NCState still clinging to a two-point lead with 6:23 left. Both teams are visibly gassed. #Duke is looking forward to whomever it gets.
#NCState is playing amazing defense at the #ACCTourney. Allowing only 54.3 ppg in Greensboro, the team allowed 64.7 overall this year.
Julius Hodge just popped up on the jumbotron to loud cheer. He also joined the "Wolf-Pack" cheer. It's getting loud in here!
What was I saying about going inside? Gonzalez hits his first two 3s, back to back, and #NCState leads 36-33 with 14:16 remaining.
After missing his first five attempts, Dennis Horner knocks down his first 3-pointer for the #Wolfpack. The defensive energy is much better.
#NCState must get something gong inside if it's going to over come a 10-point deficit ... Wait, Woods, from 3! Forget it...
My eyes aren't bleeding yet, but there has been some bad basketball played at this #ACCTourney. Duke-Miami has been the best game so far.
@DaveTelep Don't you mean 2A?
Not much flow to this game, which favors #NCState. But the Wolfpack are a little off to start here against #GTech, which leads 15-9, 8:48.
There are a lot of sports writers' wondering why #Miami didn't foul to extend the game. #Duke survives 77-74. I've got #NCState #GTech next.
That's three shot clock violations for #Duke in the second half. The Blue Devil fans are restless (and nervous).
#Miami isn't dead yet. The Hurricanes trail #Duke 68-61 with 3:04 remaining.
That was Duke's second shot-clock violation of the 2H, but nice no-look tip-in by Singler on Scheyer's ugly shot. Too bad it couldn't count.
The Blue Devils just gave ESPN's Dickie V a fist bump. He knows #Duke Vitale has his back. The Blue Devils are up 62-50 over #Miami.
I just got @FO_ThomasPope on me about my twitter typos. Even on here, I'm not safe from editors. That'll teach me to proof things.
Scheyer has eight of his 11 points in the past 2 minutes, and Singler looks hot as well for #Duke. The clock has struck midnight, #Miami.
For those of you wondering at home, that was Coach K's first tech of the year. After getting to hear his mouth, I'm a little surprised.
Grant yelling something to the #Miami fans after he hits a 3-pointers. The Hurricanes lead Duke 35-32 at the break.
Another questionable call for Duke. Coach K takes off the jacket, bringing the #Duke faithful to their feet. He's still on the refs.
Coach K just got rang up for a technical against #Miami. He needs to get #Duke fired up with this now a two-point game with 1:26 remaining.
#Duke leads #Miami 15-9 with 11:18 left in the first half. The Plumlee brothers connected for a nice alley-oop earlier.
Singler just took one where, well, where the sun doesn't shine. He shook it off on the bench, and he's ready to check back in for #Duke
#Duke is the only high seeding left here. I really would like to see a rematch with #NCState for the championship tomorrow.
Just realized I'll be sitting behind ESPN's Dickie V for the #Duke, #Miami #ACCtournament semifinal. IT'S GOING TO BE LOUD BABY!

#FSU players are grooving in the huddle to the band. I don't think that's a good sign for #NCState, which trails 14-7.

#GTech adds to this tourney's long list of upsets with a 69-64 win against #Maryland. Can #NCState continue the trend tonight?
Greivis Vasquez is saying "good job" to the officials. I think he's being sarcastic with his team on its way home from the #ACCTourney.
@techsassy We so need a list in new media...
Karma for #Maryland? I recall their fans cheering against #Duke earlier. Now it's their team that's not making the weekend.
Fumble! I think all 10 players went after that loose ball, with Maryland getting it. The Terps trail 64-62 with 31.6 remaining.
Blown call goes for #Gtech. The shot clock went off before that dunk off the glass went down. The refs missed one there, big time.
I just crossed the 1,000 tweet barrier. I wonder where that puts me among the Fayetteville Observer's career leaders?
It's crunch time and #GTech is still holding a 62-59 lead over #Maryland. My only request: No overtime. I have #NCState to cover next.
@WPKatieCarrera I don't know, but they sure can find nice khakis. Go #Ohio, beat #Miami! (Sorry, #MAC basketball distraction)

No celebrity sightings tonights after Pat Riley attended last night's evening session - besides Dancing with the Stars' Erin Andrews. (!!!)
Tech's lead is down to 11 with 17:08 remaining. A lot of red in the stands as N.C. State's fans start showing up for their game.
Either Vasquez is going to put on a show, or #Maryland is going home early like all the other top seeds at the #ACCTourney.
Absolutely ugly first half from #Maryland and #GTech is up by 16. Could we have three first-round teams in the semifinals Saturday?
#Maryland coach Gary Williams looks like a blood vessel is about to pop. But I think he'd look that way if his team wasn't trailing by 19.
The No. 2 seed trails #GTech, the only team that didn't get upset in the first round, by 11 points. #Duke might roll right through.
About to get my first up-close look at Greivis Vasquez from #Maryland. His hair is spiked for his Greensboro debut.
We got the research staff going here. The last time a No. 12 seed reached the semifinals was #WF in 2006 in Greensboro. Nice job #Miami.
Interesting presser with #VTech coach Seth Greenberg. A writer just told the coach he should put himself in a padded room until Sunday.
The No. 12 seed is still dancing as #Miami stuns #VTEch 70-65. Now #Duke will try to end Cinderella's ball in the #ACCTourney semifinals.
#Duke reaches the semifinals with a 57-46 win against #Virginia. No Cavs field goals in the finals 6 minutes. #ACCTourney.
I still don't know if #Duke is deep enough for a long #NCAA run. The team tried to have a big rotation today, and it really didn't work.
Scheyer just woke up for #Duke, and the "Big Three" are carrying the day once again. This definitely isn't a new story line for this team.
If you can sneak away from work (or have access to a TV), you might want to watch this finish. #Duke is ahead of #Virginia 46-39, 7:40 left.
There's the #ACC Player of the Year (if I had a vote). Singler scores seven straight and #Virginia now trails #Duke 43-35, 12:13 left.
#ACC isn't giving me a lot of hope for #NCAA Tournament. Some mid-major team somewhere is going to be upset about #WF, #Clemson getting in.
Some things people should remember about #Virginia: It was on a nine-game losing streak. And its top scorer is suspended for academics.
Well, @danwiederer and I are worried a bit about how long our stay will be in #Greensboro. #Duke ahead 35-33 at the first TV break.
#Virginia is giving #Duke the old Dick Bennett Wisconsin Green-Bay treatment. The game is tied at 27 heading to halftime.
The crowd has a lot of red in it for the upcoming #Maryland game, and guess who they are cheering for? Lets just say they're with #Virginia.
This is what I get for discrediting #Virginia, the one team I thought had no chance of advancing today. #Duke is ahead 20-16 with 3:56 left.
Coach K getting in the bench's face, telling them "let's go!" He's not happy with how #Duke is playing, letting #Virginia hang around.
Tony Bennett has a #Big10 background? I couldn't tell with the score #Duke 14, #Virginia 8 with 7:51 left in the first half. #ACCTourney
#Duke sends in four during the TV timeout. I haven't seen Coach K use his bench so much this year. The Blue Devils lead #Virginia 12-6.
Seriously, the #ACCTournament is trying to kill my CPU. ESPN's Len Elmore just saved me with a great grab on a loose ball.
You've got to love a noon start. It took four minutes for #Duke and #Virginia to score the first basket. 3-0 Blue Devils, 15:45 left. Ugh.
Three underdogs advanced yesterday at the #ACCTournament. I wouldn't be surprised to see #Miami, #GTech or #NCState stay alive today.
The #Duke Blue Devil clearly reads his area newspapers. He just went down press row giving fist bumps to the Triangle writers. #ACCTourney
#NCState holds on for a 59-57 win over #Clemson. That makes three of the four first-day games upsets at the #ACCTourney.
Fayetteville's own, C.J. Williams, is on the line for #NCState with 9.2 remaining. The score is 57-54 Wolfpack, and Booker is fouled out.
Fayetteville native C.J. Williams just got fouled hard going to the hoop for #NCState. The Wolfpack lead #Clemson 51-47 with 3:09 left.
Strange intentional foul called on #NCState. The Wolfpack still lead 44-38 with 9:54 remaining.
#NCState leads 42-37 with 11:29 left. Tracy Smith leads all scorers with 15 points.
#Clemson answers right back, pulling within 33-30 with 16:20 remaining. #NCState can't get careless against the Tigers' pressure.
#NCState comes out with the first four points, and #Clemson calls timeout. Wolpack lead 29-21 with 18:26 left.
About to tip the second half between #NCState and #Clemson. This game is shaping up to be a classic big-man battle between Smith and Booker.
At the half it's 25-21 #NCState over #Clemson. Last time these two teams met, the Tigers led by as much as 18 in the second half.
#Clemson has pulled within 25-21 of #NCState with 39.2 left in the first half. #ACCtourney
#NCState leads #Clemson 21-13 with 3:55 left in the first half. No offense is coming easy in this game. #ACCtourney
Gonzalez back in for #NCState with 6:47 left. He looks to be walking on it fine.
I spy Gonzalez back on the bench for #NCState with 7:35 left.
No sign of Gonzalez on the bench with 8:07 left. #NCState still leads #Clemson 18-11 as Booker and Smith face off inside.
Gonzalez is up and testing his right leg for #NCState. The Wolfpack is up 11-8 without him, though, against Clemson with 13:00 remaining.
Javier Gonzalez limps off the court favoring his right ankle for #NCState. The Wolfpack lead #Clemson 7-5 with 15:00 left in the first half.
@chrislittmann Dino Gaudio is an Ohio University alum? Why haven't we ever seen him at homecoming?
I volunteered for the nightcap, so I get the deadline that comes with it. We're about to tip between #NCState and #Clemson.
#GTech downs #UNC 62-58. Stay tuned for #Clemson and #NCState to close out the night. Can the Wolpack give NC two teams in the second round?
61-58 #Gtech leads with 36.6 left and 25 on the shot clock. The Jackets have the ball. #UNC needs a turnover on this inbounds.
Nothing pretty, but Lawall sinks a hook and #UNC turns the ball over. #GTech on the line shooting two, leading 60-56 with 1:28 left.
Zeller gets blocked and its 58-56 #GTech over #UNC with 2:09 left. Lets see what the Jackets draw up after their timeout.
#UNC needs to keep running the offense through Zeller (17 points). The Jackets have no answer for him. #GTech leads 58-56 with 4:04 left.
You can still tell this game is being played in North Carolina. The crowd is on its feet as #UNC ties #Gtech at 56-56 with 4:37 remaining.
#Wolfpack fans are cheering on #GTech over #UNC.
Timeout on the floor with 7:55 left, and the game between #UNC and #GTech is tied 52-52. This is the best game of the first day so far.
Henson just picked up his fourth foul, sending him to the bench. Zeller (15 points) must step up for #UNC, which trails #g-tech 52-50. 9:53
With 11:47 remaining, we have a tie game between #gtech and #unc, 49-49. Can the Tar Heels avoid the three-game sweep to the Yellow Jackets?
Those watching ESPN2 at home should stick around for a look at #UNC basketball history. (It pays to sit behind the commentators).
The wireless internet has been going in and out here inside Greensboro Coliseum. I guess this is the first-day bugs at the #acctournament.
#UNC leads 42-41 with about 14 minutes remaining against #gtech. Sorry I mentioned history Tar Heels fans.
#unc enters the second half looking to become the first no. 10 seed since the #wolfpack in 2007 to win at the #acctourney.
#unc rallies from an early deficit to lead 31-22 with about 2 minutes left in the first half. The tar heels have never played today before.
Dear friends, please quit texting @danwiederer and I. We know we are sitting behind the espn2 announcers.
Just almost lost my computer when a careless writer spilled pepsi on it. I'd like to thank my neighbors for saving me while I was at dinner.
#WF still trails #Miami 56-39 with 11:55 remaining. Ish leads the Deacs with 12 points. #acctourney
Dino Gaudio graduated from Ohio University in 1981!? I didn't know he was a fellow Bobcat. His stock just went up. #OU #acctourney.
#WF sure doesn't look like a tournament team. It didn't score for about 6 minutes to start the first half and trails 49-30 with 15:54 left.
Aminu has only 4 points after the first half on 1-for-6 shooting for #WF. He needs to get going if his team is going to overcome 14 points.
We are at the half and #WF needs to get its shooting right for the second half. The Deacs trail #Miami 41-27, shooting .310 from the field.
#WF has now had two shots from the corner clank against the backboard. #WF trails #Miami 37-27 with 2:06 left in the first half. #acctourney
#Miami is 6 of 10 from 3-point range and leads #WF 37-25 with 3:23 left in the first half. The crowd is trying to get the Deacons going.
#WF just got a shot-clock violation. The Deacs trail #Miami 29-19 with 6:18 left in the first half. #acctourney
#Miami comes out flying with three different players scoring. It leads #WF 13-8 at the first TV timeout at 14:07. #acctourney
About to tip the #wf #Miami game. These two teams split during the regular season. #acctourney  http://twitpic.com/17ybwt
#Virginia beats #bc 68-62 to snap it's nine-game losing streak. The last win came on feb. 3 against #ncstate. #acctourney
#Virginia isn't giving #bc any hope from the foul line. The cavs lead 65-59 with 17.3 left.
#Virginia up 61-55 with 56.3 left. #acctourney
Zieglinski's career high for #Virginia is 24. He has 21 right now and his team leads #bc 58-52 with 3:34 left.
Scott hits a pair to push #Virginia to a 53-46 lead with 6:56 left. The cavs are 3-14 when they score less than 70.
#Virginia calls timeout with it's lead only 49-46 with 8:43 left. The cavs are 11-1 this season when they score 70. Will they make it?
Nice roar from the #Virginia crowd as it takes a 48-38 lead with 11:57 left. Meyinsse has 11 inside as the cavs continue to hit 3s outside.
#Virginia up 41-35 on #bc with 15:01 left. The eagles had only 8 points in the paint in the first half and need to get the inside game going
#Virginia leads #bc 34-27 at the half. Zeglinski has 16, shooting 6 of 9 from the field. #acctourney
#Virginia gets a couple 3s and a dunk from Meyinsse to take a 29-25 lead with 3:01 left. #bc needs to get going inside. #acctourney
Still impressed with the rapid rise of #Virginia coach Tony Bennett. I know a lot of #cougs miss him at #WSU. Got to love the Big Ten roots.
Zeglinski has 10 for #Virginia and Sanders has 10 for #bc. The eagles lead 23-17 with 9:46 left in the first half. #acctourney
Zeglinski drops 8 before the first tv timeout, and #Virginia leads 10-9 with 14:47 left. #acctourney
#bc has won a game at every #acctourney it has played at the past four years. #Virginia will be pressed with landesberg suspended.
Our seats for the tourney are pretty nice. I don't think we're getting much of a crowd for the #FSU #bc game.  http://twitpic.com/17xly0
#Virginia forward Jerome Meyinse has been given the Skip Prosser Award, which honors the top scholar athlete in men's basketball.

South central beats westover girls 67-59 to advance to the 3a state championship game.
South central is too much. The falcons lead westover 64-44 with3:39 left.
Westover girls trail south central 42-28 at the half. The wolverines shot 2 of 11 from the foul line in 2Q to help sc pull away.
Westover coach gene arrington says his team must play slow today (what?!). He doesn't want to run with speedy south central.
At jh rose for the 3a girls eastern regional final between south central and westover.
The big three have 37 of duke's 40 points. The blue devils lead 40-21 with 3:45 left. #acc
#unc has only two field goals in the first 8 minutes. #duke is contesting everything and leads 19-6 with 11:49 left.

@AnishESPN sounds about right for somebody who works at espn.
Scheyer hits a 3 and celebrates with smith to cap a 13-2 duke run. The hokies trail 60-51 with 3:16 left.
Zoubek with a huge putback puts duke back on top 51-47. The hokies look a bit deflated with 7:09 left. Blue devils finally producing inside
Tie game 42-42 with 11:18 left. Things are getting chippy out there as duke tries to get inside. Who will start hitting shots?
#hokies come roaring back to pull within 39-38. #duke needs to get something going inside if their shooting doesn't return.
Both teams went cold again, but scheyer hits a 3 heading into the tv timeout. With 3:29 left in the half, #duke leads the #hokies 31-23.
#duke went about six minutes between field goals, staying alive from the foul line. The team is heating up now and leads 23-16. 7:30.
#duke using hustle to make up for its poor shooting. Mason Plumlee picked up two fouls quick. 14-11 hokies. 11:35.
#duke missing a lot of shots early. #hokies lead 8-6 with 15:28 left in the first half. Plumlees about to check in.

Skeelo is being played during the All-Star game. (My all-time favorite rapper).
Now it's time for the #NBAPA All-Star game. The players voted Josh Selby (#Tennessee) and Brandon Knight (no commitment) as the top two.
A dunk contest is about to start here at the #NBAPA Camp. After watching kids warm up, this should be interesting.

Damontre just launched his first 3-pointer. It didn't go in, but I've seen the 6-9 big man hit them.
Still sticking on court one to watch Damontre play his second game of the tournament. The Cavs need a win after losing their opener.
New blog post: ACC mish-mash... http://bit.ly/JNJRX
Just cracked 100 followers. Thanks to all the people who take an interest in what we do. ACC, region colleges, preps, I tweet it all.
Also on the Jazz are #Wake Forest recruits C.J. Barksdale and Jelan Kendrick.
A lot of big recruits on Bullock's team. Josh Hairston is going to #Duke and is looking good. This Jazz team is up 22-8 early.
I am staying in my seat to watch #UNC commit Reggie Bullock for the first time. 6-7, 195 lbs, SG from Kinston NC.
C.J. Leslie (#UNC #Wolfpack) has a tough matchup with another N.C. State recruit, LaQuinton Ross.
Life doesn't get easier for potential Duke recruit Harrison Barnes with a big matchup against #Texas commit Tristan Thompson.
Warmups for the second round of games at the #NBAPA camp have started. Stay tuned for more action...
Done writing my feature. The #NBAPA Camp will resume play with games at 7:30 p.m. I will be blogging and tweeting the action.

I'll have to admit, this #NBAPA Top 100 thing is a little freaky. There are people walking around with boom mics and camcorders everywhere.
Fixing some technical problems on the blog. C.J. Leslie is about to hit the floor here for the start of the fourth quarter.
C.J. Leslie is on the court with the Pistons. He's not a favorite among #Wolfpack fans right now. But #UNC is thankful for that.

Game 1s are over... Time for interviews...
Harris on the court playing some strong defense. This is a big camp for him..
A little more enthusiasm here on court 3. Damontre is on the bench, but jared sullinger is worth watching.
New blog post: A lot to watch... http://blogs.fayobserver.com/shugar/2009/06/18/a-lot-to-watch/
7-0, 265-lbs center Fab Melon has been a force inside. #FSU and #Miami are after him in the #ACC. Barnes is a rebounding machine.
Harrison Barnes' team is off to a bad start, trailing 16-6. Devon Collier, who has #Virginia Tech and #FSU interested, showed outside touch.
#Duke commit Andre Dawkins definitely can sky. He threw down one rebound putback and nearly had another to start.
#Duke commit Andre Dawkins also will be playing in the first game. My main focus throughout the day will be #ACC players.
Warmups just started here at the #NBAPA Top 100 camp. I'll have updates on #Duke recruit Harrison Barnes vs. #Wake Forest commit J.T. Terrel
