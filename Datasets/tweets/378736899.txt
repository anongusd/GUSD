@CBSNews My first, and only thought, is how devastated this family must be to hear someone minimize the death of their son. My heart breaks for them....
The adult just casually strolls over - after quite a while.... https://t.co/j8qxRix3EH
@ClintSmithIII Correct. People view the situation differently when it comes to race. It’s true that a white man stands alone, while the black community as a whole ends up carrying the burden of one. If you think that’s not true, you’re covering your heads.

Ok. Maybe one more tweet befor I put myself in the corner for timeout...	I get to the school to pick my kiddo up for a doctor appointment - 2:39 - was told “our cutoff is 2:30 for picking your child up early, for future reference.” I don’t think this is a district policy.....
Angry today for no reason. At least I can’t identify the reason... Think I’ll stay off of social media for the day, before imminent meltdown hits critical mass.
@CNBC Would explain the reason they suck at their jobs...
@realDonaldTrump There’s no appreciation when The President actually says something acceptable to all Americans. Finding fault with this statement, denotes baseless opinions centered in personal hatred. Choose your battles boo boo. This ain’t one of them.
@kellengoff What time did you go to sleep?
@CNBC R/T please:	I support vaping. If teens are accessing these, then that’s a law enforcement issue, not a product one. I think I’m going to look into this brand because, well - smoking an actual cigarette isn’t super great for me either....@JUULvapor #vaping #vapingsaveslives

@AJA_Cortes If you want to be a certain type of woman that attracts that certain type of man, then by all means, change yourself. Congratulations on the viral tweet. ;)
@luvkit @BrennaSpencer @AJA_Cortes Wow - I just stared at that waaaaay to long....
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, with all due respect, so is misleading people into believing if you don’t like something it isn’t the truth. 	Please, just stop responding this way. It makes you seem like you’re scared of them?
@SenGillibrand @samswey This is among the things that never see the light of day. The sheer damage done to so many people. The poor, women, minorities, people trying to buy homes, those seeking healthcare, former students trying to work and pay back loans.... People should know how bad it really is.
@realDonaldTrump Yes, they are an unbelievably important asset. We could not have moved forward as a nation to this point without their contributions, sweat, tears and blood. Thank you to every African-American that made this possible. I would hate to think where we would have been otherwise. 💕
Has anyone else tried running an ad via Instagram? I get lots of response - from fake accounts, that are then wiped out by @instagram. Leaving me with zero ROI. It’s happened several times, even with carefully selected targeting. 😢

@ChrisSalcedoTX Absolutely the child is traumatized. The current social climate attaches gigantic importance to hairstyles at his age. He was assaulted. If they disagreed with him having two arms, would they remove one? Not acceptable. @HicoISD Fire the principal immediately.
@ChrisSalcedoTX The school does not have authority to alter any physical element of a child’s body. Hair is not a shirt. They asaulted this child by changing something attached to his body. Suspend him instead. I hope the Mother sues them and principal and teacher are dismissed. @HicoISD
School cuts highschooler’s hair - without parental permission. Excuse me? There is no way to justify this, and I hope mom is looking for an attorney as I type this...		https://t.co/5p3kIPI3r2

I think the last election has changed the way campaigns should be approached. I would caution all potential candidates not to make sweeping promises that alienate large groups of potential voters. Just stand on change and the willingness to work for the American people.
@KPRC2 This is such a difficult choice! I think I would want to sit down with Malcolm X. He went through so many transformations of thought, and still had work to do and a message to share. I would have loved to see what he would have brought the world. He was just getting started.
I’m so happy it’s Friday!! 💖
My guilty pleasure is reading the replies to President Trumps tweets. The discussion starts out logically before spiraling into pre-school level name calling and insults toward anyone that dares to disagree. It’s like watching a scary movie.

@realDonaldTrump I don’t always agree with you, but I’m not a proponent of “humans are driving climate change” propaganda. The climate is far more complex than human understanding. Are we contributing, yes - are we the sole cause, of course not. Lunacy can’t comprehend that.

@realDonaldTrump And hopefully in the next 5-10 years, which is a more realistic projection. Dedicate enough funding to get it started. I would however, look into forcing the Dem’s hands on implementing the other “tech ideas” in addition. I don’t think they really intend to get those into play.
@abc13houston No income changes, but major drop on our return. “Someone” must not think this class of people would have a voice. Thank you @abc13houston for speaking up on behalf of people not deemed important enough to defend themselves. You can’t say something and make it true. #honesty
This is what I’ve been saying. No one is seeing larger refunds as has been stated by a certain individual 🙄. You can’t just say something and make it true.

@paulborza I would say the single biggest trick to increase productivity when working from home, is to make yourself and others aware that your work hours are just as important as someone with a traditional job. It’s super easy to fall into the trap of not respecting that time.
@SenSchumer @staceyabrams So you indeed never intended to work out something that would stop illegal immigration and help immigrants in the correct way to become citizens. You just revealed your hand. I’m done with all of you.

#Ardell magnetic lashes are a solid fail. Scratched my cornea with the magnets trying to place the lower strip. If you can get these to work, you have enough lashes to not need these. My eye is on FIRE 🔥 @ArdellBeauty the magnets aren’t strong enough and they are SHARP!
@beautyandblanc Sratched my cornea trying to use these. Attempting to put them on the lower lash is dangerous. Could never get them to clamp and for these to work, you need lashes full enough not to need lashes in the first place. Never had this much trouble w/ glue. My eye is on fire y’all.

I wish they would both try.
@Georgia1006 I’m pretty sure an 18 year trend isn’t going to change that much. We will have to wait until they compile the data and look it over. I’m personally really concerned with the overstayed visas. It’s definitely a multi-level problem.
@RobertMCle @signal26 @Alyssa_Milano @TalkPoverty Nope sweetie - don’t mistake me. I never said she was the answer either. The wall issue wouldn’t be an issue. That’s all I said. The dems and republicans need to work together on this issue. The wall alone won’t do it, nor what they dems have suggested. Both together - maybe.
@mcryan32 @signal26 @Alyssa_Milano @TalkPoverty Not at all. I presume you believe I am. But you’ve the right to an opinion.
@Alyssa_Milano You have to keep in mind that most of them probably can’t define bigotry. Taking a stand is acceptable, we do t have to agree, but this doesn’t allow Phillips to damn near assault a child because of incorrect assumptions. Just sayin. Dude was wrong.
@Hesaiddat @Alyssa_Milano Inappropriate. No matter what side you’re on in this. Please stop posting things like this.
@pillowfarmer @RosenCampbell @Alyssa_Milano @cmclymer Conjecture.
@pillowfarmer @RosenCampbell @Alyssa_Milano @cmclymer I’m so glad Phillips isn’t from our tribe. I would be on the phone with the tribal council over this in a second. Embarrassing man making inaccurate assumptions....
@RepKarenBass @Alyssa_Milano Yes girl. Keep on fighting. America needs strength like this.
@Alyssa_Milano @thesunandstorm @TalkPoverty Politics are being put before people and no amount of bi-partisan flag waving can remotely justify what’s going on right now. Anyone who thinks this is ok is wrong - and no clever arguments can or will change that fact.
@signal26 @Alyssa_Milano @TalkPoverty Because if he wasn’t president there wouldn’t BE a problem. That’s why.
@Appleshare3 Way to go Apple!!
@FAIRImmigration I agree, but it’s a complex problem that will take a complex multilevel approach. Both sides (republican and democrat) need to work together on this one.

@RealMattCouch Me too wasn’t one sided. It was a place for anyone and everyone to open up about abuse. This falls into the realm of downright scary. Bad move @Gillette for not understanding the issue before speaking on it.
I try super hard not to get political on my social media, but this shutdown over a Washington power struggle is a serious problem. Egos aside, both of these factions need to get their behinds back to work and get something done. The American people should ALWAYS come first.

@walkwile72 @FOX26Houston @realDonaldTrump That’s what we get with media these days. I think it’s time we start demanding truth and not embellished opinion.
@margiea23155771 @FOX26Houston @realDonaldTrump And I’m well aware of what coyote trails are. I’m also aware that expired visas are also a problem as are the legal points of entry.
@margiea23155771 @FOX26Houston @realDonaldTrump I’m saying both parties need to work together to solve the multiple issues that exist. One or the other won’t fix anything. It’s a complex problem that will take a lot of different approaches to solve. Misinformation isn’t helping anything.
@walkwile72 @FOX26Houston @realDonaldTrump I’m saying the know facts are being distorted, and as you pointed out, other information isn’t t reaching us. I think it’s more complex than either party is admitting to, and one or the other won’t solve the problems. It’s going to take them working together, and neither will.
Illegal immigration is multi-level, complex problem, that won’t be solved with a single wall or slightly improved border security as either party has stated. ALL of our politicians need to get off their lazy camera-talking rear ends and work together for the good of EVERYONE.
@NealBTomlinson @FOX26Houston @realDonaldTrump I completely agree with this!
@KevinHart4real At least you apologized and moved past the issue. I hate that you won’t be doing the oscars this year, and I’m sorry that people are so sensitive that they can’t move forward or recognize true growth and awareness. That’s weakness and insecurity on their part.
@SteveABC13 @abc13houston @KevinHart4real Right?!! Freedom of speech has been replaced with a “politically correct” field of land mines. There’s a point at which too much sensitivity hinders social growth and we’ve reached that point. @KevinHart4real you will be missed, but it’s completely understandable.
@abc13houston Sad that this young man is no longer with us, but it sounds like he got medical attention. Does anyone have more info as to what happened on the ride to the hospital? I’d like to hear that, as it’s not clear why it’s considered a wrongful death.
@EdwardAshton30 @realDonaldTrump All legal Americans are “real Americans” as much as you might hate to acknowledge that fact. President Trump is president to all parties, races, beliefs and cultures of the United States. You don’t get to pick and choose whom you feel is real or not.
@NealBTomlinson @FOX26Houston @realDonaldTrump I agree it’s chicken feed, but why aren’t our politicians looking at the largest problems which are coming through legal points of entry? I’m honestly curious about that. Bi-partisan aside.
@KohlenbergerRon @FOX26Houston @realDonaldTrump 90% of the heroin comes through legal points of entry, a majority of illegal immigrants overstayed visas, and border crossings have been declining every year. I’m not making any of this up, those are actual statistics. There are clearly bigger issues that aren’t being addressed.
@FOX26Houston @realDonaldTrump Most of the problems we are dealing with regarding illegal immigration, and drug problems are coming through legal points of entry. They did not illegally cross the border. So where are the plans to fix this?
@FOX26Houston @realDonaldTrump No seriously guys, it would be easier for me to support this issue if he just said “I want a wall, let’s build it and see what happens”	Instead, I’m hearing a lot more misinformation being given as reasons to keep Americans at the mercy of bleeping bi-partisan politics.
RT @AP_Politics: President Trump claims illegal immigration is 'humanitarian crisis,' though crossings into US have declined in recent year…

@nytpolitics I just have one question: 	Does the president elected to office solely represent Americans who belong to their party, or should they stand for Americans as a whole? Bipartisanship needs to be put to rest in this country in my opinion. What’s yours?
@abc13houston Where was her new husband? He should have been the one telling the disrespectful couple and their kids to leave since it sounds like they were his family’s friends. They deserved to be embarrassed. Maybe the next time they will think twice.
@theozhouston @abc13houston I’m ignorant on how ICE operates. Could you tell me more about how they are prevented from doing their job? How do they usually conduct business etc?
@realDonaldTrump Close it. Save the money, then build the wall, but as president you’re the leader of both republicans and democrats like it or not. Staying focused on a goal is commendable, but don’t hurt Americans in the process. You’re the president, so be a leader of your country and people.
@emily_delozier @MiaFarrow @realDonaldTrump Or in Berlin - but that didn’t make that one right either.
@MiaFarrow @realDonaldTrump Yes girl. Yes.
@realDonaldTrump So change the laws and then look at building a wall. You have the discussion started, is it important enough to hurt this country for something you perceive as your legacy? Shouldn’t matter if it happens during your time in office or someone else’s if it’s indeed that important.
@abc13houston This makes no sense - a drop in business overall, or a reduction in morning breakfast purchases? I don’t get it. @McDonalds
@NetflixFilm @netflix Nice one!
@wilsonmedic Good heavens the impact you must have felt from that brilliant craftiness.
@EyeEatCat1 @abc13houston Amen! This!!!
@abc13houston The first question people ask is where are they from. If they’re here legally does this make it right? No. If we build a wall right now, would this be prevented? NO. We need to fix this on a local level, not a federal one. What can we do today, at home?

@FalResistsHate Stop and check in with yourself. Evaluate whether the overwhelm is coming from things that are out of your control. If so, start focusing solely on things you CAN control and let go of rest. This always seems to help me get clarity. Hang in there and DM me if you want to chat.
@abc13houston A drunk person is not be responsible enough to find safe transportation, but people act shocked when they don’t. The people serving the alcohol either need to make sure people aren’t driving, or give up their liquor license. The fact they served this kid at all is atrocious.

@margieqwintero @TedDBear8 @abc13houston Yes mam! They pick and choose what they allow as an expense. Many reasonable and necessary expenses aren’t included. So you look like you have more income than you do. A lady from SNAP told me to include some of those expenses in the amount of rent I reported. FYI
@Suluclac @abc13houston I was speaking strictly about inability to qualify for children’s health insurance through the state. They have a very narrow margin of eligibility. ER’s being used for doctor visits and not having to pay - entirely different story.
@RachelSuperEli1 @Bc1906Trader @all4feets @abc13houston Explain the Americans that are denied because they don’t fall into a specific range of income. There are people actually working and trying to make it - but they fall outside of the qualification guidelines. Not enough money, but make too much. That’s a serious problem.
@Suluclac @abc13houston Not great to generalize this kind of issue when many many people I know are denied and are not illegal. The rules of qualification need to change in general.
@golfstar2010 @abc13houston Not always just a minority issue. Texas has a problem with “poor” in general. Classicism at its best.
@TedDBear8 @margieqwintero @abc13houston They don’t help many people. It has to be a complicated case. The reason I was given as to why they are extremely limited in cases they accept - not enough funding.
@margieqwintero @TedDBear8 @abc13houston Amen! Just because the programs are “available” doesn’t mean those in most need qualify. People need to become more educated.
@abc13houston This isn’t remotely surprising. Look at Texas public education as well.

@earlflynn @bregman_stache @abc13houston @earlflynn oh my goodness....lol.
@HaitianDiva13 @bregman_stache @RevBeauWalker @wilsonmedic @alovingNana1 @abc13houston Good one! Lol
@jeffreyhenning @alovingNana1 @bregman_stache @abc13houston At least on a societal stage.
@jeffreyhenning @alovingNana1 @bregman_stache @abc13houston Definitely. Dave Ramsey drew heat for spending a boatload building his house. But, he uses the house for a lot of charity events and things of that nature. He responded to the criticism personally. I would love to be wealthy, and I’m a Christian, but I see how the two don’t mix.
@AsPrynne I agree. There seems to still be a stigma connected with seeking help in my opinion. Anytime you’re evaluated for any reason, professionals, doctors, law enforcement, employers etc. want dig it up and use it against you. I feel this really needs to stop! 🛑
@wilsonmedic @alovingNana1 @bregman_stache @abc13houston Let me ask you this - do you feel that churches maybe should operate under a regular business structure? Maybe lose the non-profit status? Or would that lead to a bigger problem?
@jeffreyhenning @alovingNana1 @bregman_stache @abc13houston My view is just that if he gets paid like an employee and he expands on his income via other avenues (while still benefiting people) then he has the right to spend that money the way he wants. Like any other thought leader, or inspirational “guru.” Just my opinion.
@bregman_stache @wilsonmedic @alovingNana1 @abc13houston I see where your coming from. I appreciate all of you sharing your deeper reasons for your points of view.
@wilsonmedic @alovingNana1 @bregman_stache @abc13houston Also a good point to consider.
@wilsonmedic @alovingNana1 @bregman_stache @abc13houston That’s a great point I hadn’t previously considered.
@bregman_stache @RevBeauWalker @wilsonmedic @alovingNana1 @abc13houston I love that you can argue with humor. It’s very refreshing! :)
@RevBeauWalker @bregman_stache @wilsonmedic @alovingNana1 @abc13houston Very muddy indeed. :)
@wilsonmedic @alovingNana1 @bregman_stache @abc13houston But where is the line drawn between what belongs to the church and what he’s earned with his paycheck. I honestly see both sides. Just looking at it legally vs. from a moral opinion.
@piemikey @alovingNana1 @bregman_stache @abc13houston I do see both sides of the argument. I’m just saying at what point does the line between religion and a job get drawn? I feel like he’s entitled to his paycheck and has a right to spend it the way he wants. Should that include church funds? No. His own money that he earned? Yes.
@RevBeauWalker @wilsonmedic @alovingNana1 @bregman_stache @abc13houston So all in all, he still gets a set pay amount on which he pays taxes and then could invest.
@wilsonmedic @alovingNana1 @bregman_stache @abc13houston All joking aside, maybe you could explain, I’m wondering if there’s a difference in the way churches are set up structurally? Or if the same non profit rules apply to possible income from investment of his personal money? Just wondering.
@alovingNana1 @bregman_stache @abc13houston But honestly, a man that works should still get paid. Lots of people pay for services. Being a pastor is a service. Tony Robbins built his empire on the money of others and no one’s complaining because God isn’t the main focus of his inspiration. How is this different?
@bregman_stache @abc13houston Lol. Happy to pay a working man.
@abc13houston No need to defend ANYTHING. Happy anniversary and what a lucky wife! :)

Anyone have thoughts on cross promotion of social media accounts? Promoting your profile from twitter to Instagram etc?
Given the experiment I ran via twitter promotion, it’s not a viable way to get engagement. Nearly $10 and 1 like, 2 expanded details. Not for people starting out on social media. You would have to put a considerable amount of money in. Instagram results coming soon. #socialmedia
Given the current social media climate, do you think it’s possible to achieve influencer status without paying money or going to extremes? Running a social experiment. #feedly #socialmediamarketing #socialmedia #Crucibleproductions #questions
