@SDSULGBTQ1 @CPAC @realDonaldTrump @billmaher @benshapiro Historically, gay groups were denied access to both public and private universities. Gay student groups couldn‚Äôt organize student clubs, use college facilities or seek roommates in school press. Gay faculty were fired and students expelled. This is true today at some privates.
@realDonaldTrump will issue an EO requiring private universities receiving fed funds to obey the First Amend.  (Most do) But Some don‚Äôt (BYU) and prohibit lgbt speech, association, and press. Now Cal can codify the edict. @Scott_Wiener @RicardoLara4CA @ToniD_SD @AsmToddGloria

TY @RichardGrenell and @realDonaldTrump for bringing to justice a Nazi War criminal who murdered 6000 Jews and gays and lesbians.  Sorry the media doesn‚Äôt see the symbolism in a Gay Ambassador and a President whose grandchildren are Jewish making this happen.@Steve_Glazer
@LorenaSGonzalez Ty for your support, but if those molested and bullied kids attend a privAte school, they are forced to arbitrate  the claims... and they lose and parents pay the costs.  That‚Äôs why @Lori4SanDiego introduced the original AB 3080, which was supported by @nathanfletcher.
@AlexCVassar @LorenaAD80 Read this one, as unpleasant as it is.   The Concurring opinion by Justice Rubin has already been cited by other courts. https://t.co/CxYWDaqsFo
@robdeko @yashar Ty @Steve_Glazer for all ur doing to make this happen again since @JerryBrownGov left office in 83.
@CaliforniaLabor @LorenaSGonzalez We love your effort, but u were a law prof at UCLA, so here‚Äôs the proof the Cal courts will no longer allow the Leg to enact anything ‚Äúhostile‚Äù to arbitration.  It‚Äôs shocking cuz opinion is a scathing insult to the Legislature.  Even @AGBecerra is not seeking review at Sup Ct. https://t.co/CyBXaKvp7C
@SDNewsfeed Breaking fake news!!!  @GerryBraun is the real City Attorney of San Diego even though he is not a member of the Bar, but smartest legal mind.  @Steve_Glazer @MaraWElliott @LaurieBlackSD @3menmom @MichaelSmolens
@LorenaAD80 Please reach out to @AlexCVassar cuz he reads every appellate case affecting Cal law...I hope he finds some hope for your bill but Cal App says ‚Äúno hostility‚Äù to arbitration... https://t.co/JeikZ8vmqe
@LorenaAD80 In fairness to @SenToniAtkins and @AsmShirleyWeber they did a terrific job but apparently not even @AGBecerra was willing to save it or even file a Cert Petition.   @Lori4SanDiego original part has survived. https://t.co/15ae4VJ3bA
@DuffyEdjduffy @LorenaAD80 @TeamLocal399 We love @LorenaAD80 But the California Supreme Court unanimously  voted to nullify the exact same law....(White Memorial Hospital.).  So this is a waste of time and misleading to workers. @Steve_Glazer @SenToniAtkins @BonnieDumanis Even @nathanfletcher voted against the bill...
@AshleyR_SD @bradracino @nathanfletcher @inewsource @GavinNewsom @ScottPetersSD @GGomezD9 @ChrisWardD3 @ToddGloria @MarySalas_ @Serge4IBMayor @mark4ibcitycoun Probably important to note that all candidates who have received contributions from public employee unions are likely to face FBI seizures and  litigation over illegal contributions https://t.co/MDFLlVQwG8
Wishing a happy bday to the only person in the Legislature who has fought for lgbt equality since 1975.  @Steve_Glazer fights for the issue that is often the most crucial for lgbt youth-  tuition free higher education.   A gay mind is a silly thing to waste....@eqca @ToddGloria

LGBT arrestees are disproportionately represented in the criminal justice system, often arrested for minor things.  But a $25000 bail forces them to stay in jail, unable to pay for a bond,  so @dems4equality @eqca should support.  @SenToniAtkins https://t.co/39eueW05AX
No one has done more to support lgbt lawyers, judges and youth than Bonnie.  She was the first openly gay person to win county-wide office.  She helped get dozens of gays and lesbians and allies appointed to judgeships.  As DA she made hate crimes a priority. She‚Äôs paid her dues. https://t.co/LFzMQZzFpJ
