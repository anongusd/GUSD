We all have hobbies. 	Here's an email I sent my newsroom on New Year's Day: "I MIGHT have an Elizabeth Warren idea... I saw something odd in her office expenditures -- it  requires a little more exploration before I can say for sure how weird it is."		https://t.co/DKS3W8qCZb
Sen. Elizabeth Warren intern payroll by year: Fiscal year 2016 - $46,000; FY 2017 - $89,000. FY 2018 - a little over $225,000.		https://t.co/DKS3W8qCZb
As I expected -- both supporters and critics of Warren see things to like in this story &gt;&gt;		Elizabeth Warren Has Evolved: She Now Pays Interns More Than Anyone Else In Congress https://t.co/DKS3W8qCZb
5) About 40 senators (including Ed Markey of Mass.) paid interns nothing in 2018. 	This will change this year as Congress approved late last year a budget for each office to pay interns. https://t.co/VY3OBCjzyP
4) Interestingly, GOP senators paid interns a total of about $1.7 million in fiscal year 2018, nearly double what Democratic senators paid (not including Bernie Sanders) https://t.co/jlkDHj11tK
3) My interns and I went through the data and provided a list of approximate intern expenditures for every senator (approx because the data reported by the Senate is occasionally wrong) https://t.co/KW3BhgXgOR
2) Advocates for paid internships were pleased but surprised to hear this, because Warren had declined to explain her internship program to them, and what determines who gets paid. https://t.co/PIm6y60BEh

Election Day liveblog update: PIZZA IS HERE!		(It's public broadcasting ... we get the Early Bird Special)
Folks who keep calling this "the most consequential midterm ever" or "in a generation"... perhaps you might recall the 2014 midterms which gave Republicans control of the Senate and the power to block Obama's SCOTUS nominee and then approve Trump's.

When I was a cub I called a lawyer about a case she was going to file. She said "have you read the statue?" I said no and she said "do your homework then call me." I read the statute, called with questions and she became a great source. https://t.co/7cUnln1qIY
If there is a subject area of particular interest, see if local bar association has continuing education class on that subject they would let you audit. Just gotta be around the jargon a while. https://t.co/I4hoIMdZHc

@blrshepherd 15 years ago I wore a French blue shirt under jacket and tie in the Capitol. Sen. John Warner stopped me. "That is a lovely shirt" he said. "Isnt it so nice to wear blue?" Thank you, Sen. My wife bought it for me. "Wives are so smart!" he said and walked off.

@danielschuman @JohnDingell Without a doubt. If Dems take the House but not the Senate, the most dramatic result may well be the House Oversight Committee.
@danielschuman I mean they Capuano and the other lawmakers all declined interview requests.
@danielschuman I agree that the decline in senior staff has led to a decline in quality oversight (think of @JohnDingell's old Energy &amp; Commerce staff). But Congress has also lost interest in serious oversight, preferring cheap theater in many cases.
@danielschuman All true. But again: Why were these bonuses more than twice what he gave in any other year? And why are his salaries so much higher than other Mass lawmakers? They declined an interview to explain.
Nope that's it.		Sorry you don't feel it is complete. https://t.co/HpYClV7A1H
