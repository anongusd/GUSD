#HUDat50 says mission: ‚Äúcreate‚Ä¶quality affordable homes for all." Median price of new homes doubled, median rents up 1/3+ since HUD created
(2/2)‚Ä¶advocates for a greater federal role in housing are just as dissatisfied with the results we get for those dollars as #HUDat50 critics
Consider this: FY16 gross discretionary budget authority requested by #HUDat50 was $49 billion. And yet... (1/2)
Witnesses at our hearing today agree Moving-to-Work program should be expanded. #HUDat50
Our system of public housing is broken.  Politicians who refuse to reform &amp; innovate are failing those most in need of assistance. #HUDat50
We must reform &amp; innovate how we provide housing assistance in 21st century with a higher purpose than simply warehousing the poor #HUDat50
Measuring success based on how many are standing in line for welfare checks vs. paychecks is a sure sign the system has failed. #HUDat50
