The 4.2 million tweets were sent from approx. 3 million unique Twitter handles. The week of December 3-9th, 2017 experienced the highest number of anti-Semitic tweets in a week: 181,700.
A total of 4.2 million anti-Semitic text-based tweets were tweeted or retweeted between Jan 2017 and Jan 2018. This translates to average of 81,400 anti-Semitic tweets per week.

“When prominent leaders refuse to condemn Farrakhan – no matter what other good they may profess to do, ADL will speak out.”
“When members of Congress align themselves with Holocaust deniers, ADL will ring the alarm.”
“When they try to put in place a Muslim ban, we will take a stand and fight them in court.”
“When there is a nominee for high office who has spouted anti-Muslim bigotry or homophobic beliefs, you better believe ADL will speak out.”
“It would be easier to lay low, and not rock the boat. To shy away from taking a stand. But I won’t do that. I know you won’t do that. ADL won’t do that.” - @JGreenblattADL

The President’s executive action to ban immigrants from majority Muslim countries &amp; other federal agency actions that discriminate against and target communities of color and other marginalized communities are counterproductive to fighting extremism.
The federal government has an essential leadership role to play in confronting terrorism, extremism, and acts of violence motivated by prejudice. It cannot do so if it scapegoats Muslims, refugees, or new immigrants to the United States.
While political rhetoric about immigrants and refugees often paints a picture of foreign-born terror, most perpetrators of Islamist extremist terrorist plots in the United States are U.S. born or legal residents in this country.

A chain of violent events resulted in the arrest of the three suspects. The group planted pipe bombs in a neighbor’s backyard in early 2018, and authorities were alerted of the group’s possession of weapons and explosives in late 2017.
The first pipe bomb exploded in August of last year at the Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center in Bloomington, Minnesota. And in November 2017, someone attempted to detonate a similar pipe bomb at a medical practice in Champaign, Illinois, a clinic that performs abortions.
The arrest revealed that three of the suspects in Clarence were also suspects in two 2017 terrorist pipe-bomb incidents. The suspects are members of a small militia cell which has a released a manifesto expressing its mission to return “to the Old America of the good old days.”
On March 13th, members of the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force arrested four people on charges of possession of fully automatic weapons in Clarence, Illinois. But the weapons weren’t the full story -- and we’ll tell you why. https://t.co/lKrb8UK3bj

Immediately, ADL sent telegrams to President Johnson &amp; other government officials, asking that "federal power" be invoked in Selma to protect the protesters.

Colorado State University in Ft. Collins (September): “Heil Hitler” was written on a Jewish student’s white board outside her dorm room.
Bentley University (September): A Jewish student discovered a swastika drawn on his dorm room door.
Another example: University of Wisconsin, Madison, September 2017. There was a drawing that contained Nazi imagery and the message "Hitler did nothing wrong" found in a campus dormitory.
This is real. It’s sad that ZOA would attack this serious report and the lives impacted by these incidents.
In Brooklyn, NY, an Orthodox Jewish woman was verbally &amp; physically assaulted; the assailant called her a "f-cking Jew." In case this wasn’t enough, here are more examples: https://t.co/XDboBbratm
Here are some of the incidents ZOA is discounting: a sixth-grade Jewish boy was the victim of anti-Semitic bullying as students taunted him with swastikas in class, and brought cigarette lighters to school telling the victim they will burn him "like they did in the Holocaust."
If you want to discount the bomb threats, the figure is still at 45%. Still, the bomb threats caused evacuations, program cancellations, and deep community anxiety.
THREAD: We are shocked ZOA is underplaying the 67% increase in anti-Semitic incidents reported in 2017. These hate incidents sparked widespread fear in the Jewish community: https://t.co/wjhS3BkDFB https://t.co/yZQZg9CHBb

“We will ask you to refuse to stay on the sidelines when others are marginalized for how they pray, where they’re from, or who they love – even if it does not appear to be your cause.” - @JGreenblattADL
“The very word ‘Renewal’ forces us to confront, not just what we fight against, but also what we fight for. I’m talking about reinvesting in the constitutional system and social contract that already makes the United States the greatest country in the world.” - @JGreenblattADL
“The truth is this: No single sector can pull off this balancing act. The world is off kilter and we need each other now more than ever.”
”We need a new compact between legislators, entrepreneurs and advocates, between startups, senators and citizens, so that organizations like the ADL and our expertise and experience can be part of the process.”
“Government and businesses cannot do this alone.  Civil society needs a seat at the table.“
”But I believe the vast majority of users would be willing to trade off immediacy for civility, anonymity for accountability, and chaos for community.”
“There is no reason to believe that introspection will slow innovation.  Far from it. Of course, creating a better future will require Big Tech to reimagine a number of their core products and make some changes.“
@JGreenblattADL “Too often, when we try to be the best, the first, the fastest, we fail. When we race toward our future, sometimes we resign responsibility.”
“One of the most important places we’re going to have to prosecute this fight now is right here in Silicon Valley.” - @JGreenblattADL on the importance of tech in the fight against #hate.
“Uncertainty is the consistent condition of LGBTQ youth who every day fear bullying because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.”
“Uncertainty fuels the gears of institutional racism that has persisted for generations.”
@JGreenblattADL “Uncertainty is a reality for 800,000 DREAMERS, who live under a constant cloud of deportation.”
“Those who say we should only be standing with ourselves are sleeping through history.  The fact is, we’re never going to be able to effectively fight cruel intentions unless we stop compartmentalizing our compassion.” - @JGreenblattADL
“We have to admit that anti-Semitism doesn’t happen in a vacuum. A spike in anti-Semitism means a spike in all forms of hatred.” - @JGreenblattADL on #antiSemitism and #hate
“Like the family in New York, whose home was spray-painted with the word JEW on the front door. Or the sixth grader in California taunted by his class with cigarette lighters, chanting they would ‘burn him like they did in the Holocaust.’”
@JGreenblattADL “According to law enforcement, hate crimes against Jews and Jewish institutions continue to make up the majority of faith-focused hate crimes in the America. In the first nine months of this year, we tracked nearly 1300 anti-Semitic incidents.”
“To be clear, hatred against Jews is not new....Over generations, good people were able to push prejudice out of the public square and into the shadows. But today, it’s out in the open - in our schools, on social media, and everywhere in between.” -@JGreenblattADL
