I guess in summary, the point is that we've shifted closer to a democracy and away from the republican concept, and if we want to continue having a system that is viewed as fair to those involved, we'll need to reassess the structure of our legislative branches.
5) We need to consider the fact that over 230 years, the driving dynamics of decision making have changed to be more dependant on policy impact on individual voters, which in turn manifests in partisanship.
4 cont.) To answer yes you have to make a partisan argument, which in of itself is a valid counterargument to the framework of the Constitution. The Constitution is a safeguard for a nation where the biggest divide was small versus large states.
4) Can you imagine a world in which the states of California or Texas accepted received 1/69 or 1/50 of the representation the smallest state receives in the Senate?
3) At the time of the signing, a resident in the smallest state got 6.4x the representation a resident in the largest one did. That number is now 69.3x. In fact, 28 states receive worse representation in the Senate now than the worst case at the time of the signing.
2) The average U.S. House seat had a population of about 33,000. For comparative purposes, the average Indiana Statehouse Rep's district has about 66,000 people and the average State Senator's district has 133,000 people.
This is a small series of tweets about why we need to reconsider how our political system works. 		1) At the signing of the Constitution, the U.S. population was less than 3 million. It is now 326 million.

@willfranklin28 @samalbert_21 Yeah, eliminating life time appointments, rather than electing judges.
@willfranklin28 @samalbert_21 Oh, and can I convince a Justice to step down so I can appoint one to sit there for longer. Even the Justices are becoming partisan power brokers. At a certain point, the makeup of the Court starts to clash with the concept of consent of the governed.
@willfranklin28 @samalbert_21 At a certain point it starts to clash with consent of the governed, not just on SCOTUS but the federal bench. We have a complex electoral system, but it doesn't change that we're a nation of individuals. And this ties into other issues we must figure out.
@willfranklin28 @samalbert_21 We both know the way it should be, but essentially the Supreme Court has become a third elected branch, its makeup governed by long term election trends and luck. Who gets elected, how lucky they get in the electoral college, how lucky are they with the timing of SCOTUS deaths.
@willfranklin28 @samalbert_21 The same way that I'll shrug and be mildly relieved if Kavanaugh fails to be confirmed and Democrats hold Trump's nominees hostage despite knowing what the Senate's constitutional duty is, conservatives were equally ok with ignoring Merrick Garland.
@willfranklin28 @samalbert_21 Both parties view the other's nominees as judicial activists, and they use partisan maneuvers to attempt to prevent judges from sitting on the court, and we all condone it to some degree.
@willfranklin28 @samalbert_21 Both parties are using litmus tests, essentially tying the makeup of the court to the views of strong partisans elected to the Presidency. To the point where we have an admin. that outsources its nominee selection to an interest group (and you can bet Dems will do the same).
@willfranklin28 @samalbert_21 Battle lines have been drawn around party lines in the last few decades. Roe v. Wade was across party lines and ideological camps, since then the dynamic of basically everything has changed. Individual right to bear arms interpretation arose from a party-line majority in Heller.
@willfranklin28 @samalbert_21 Kavanaugh's meltdown yesterday about the left, the Democrats, and the Clinton's might have been the first time it's been this public, but it clearly isn't a new thing. Justices are essentially partisans down the line at this point.
@willfranklin28 @samalbert_21 I wholly love Hamilton's proposal in theory, but it isn't working in practice. I think we'll need to start considering ideas such as Rick Perry's single term 18 year appointment idea. Clearly the Supreme Court has become highly partisan.

We need to support @payourinterns and push Congress to appropriate ~$40 million in subsequent years so that we can make sure that all interns are paid! Oh, and we also have to figure out funding for in-district interns too. This is a great start, but there's still work ahead! :)
Meanwhile, the amount the Congress appropriated is the equivalent of  ~$1830 for an 8-week internship. In other words, if we want interns to make about $5000 over the course of 8 weeks (which allows them an extra $1000), we need to pay them $15.65 per hour. (cont.)
UPenn estimates the cost of an 8-week internship in DC is about $4000, excluding tourism, entertainment, etc. That is if you room in a college dorm. Staying elsewhere will probably add $500 to $1000 dollars to that cost estimate. (cont.)
That is based on an estimate of House offices having 3 interns and Senate offices having 6 interns. To be sure, that is an amazing start that must be celebrated, but it's not enough. (cont.)
Assuming that Congressional internships happen during only 36  weeks of the year, and that outside of @CHCI, @CBCFInc, and @APAICS there are constantly 500 paid internships available, Congress just approved paying the remainder of the interns $5.71 per hour. (Short thread)

@DonForCongress Also, JFK was not that progressive, just in case you didn't know. The biggest difference between him and Nixon was the age and the name.
@DonForCongress Best of luck, and act like a serious candidate.
@DonForCongress That's just a way to run and proclaim "They ignored me. I was right all along." And that gets neither you, nor I, nor the country anywhere.
@DonForCongress If not, you're just screaming at the sky for no reason, w/o seeking to convince an area that doesn't agree with you. That's no way to win.
@DonForCongress Also, if you're serious about winning in the 4th Congressional District in Indiana, learn that you need to justify your positions.
@DonForCongress Because when they see a young face acting in a childish way, they will have seen all they need to know before they vote for someone else.
@DonForCongress Support single payer, just don't act like a kid while doing so. Maybe that way some people will take you seriously.
@DonForCongress Decisions are nuanced, and to just call individuals who you hope to serve with cowards will not get you anywhere.
@DonForCongress Must have felt nice to act like a kid when writing that, right? You can hold that view, I do too. But Congress is about more than stunts.
