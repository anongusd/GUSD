“I am critical of Speaker Pelosi’s lack of willingness to work with the administration on a compromise number that includes border security," said Stefanik, "and I think she needs to come to the table to do that.” #NY21 @SunCmtyNews
“The lawmaker said she’s long been opposed to shutdowns, which is why she voted for the bills, as well as an appropriations bill last month that initially authorized funding for the wall.” Stefanik told The Sun on Monday. #NY21 @SunCmtyNews
I know that many in #NY21 are continuing to work hard without pay. Every Member of Congress should have their pay withheld during this shutdown. I have voluntarily done so. We must live by the same laws as the rest of the American people. #NY21 https://t.co/B5hjpSfkyB
Congress must do our work and end this shutdown on behalf of the American people. When I ran for Congress, I promised my constituents I would not vote to shut down the government. I have kept and will continue to keep that promise. #NY21

Transparency is important as to who we vote for as elected officials. I am supporting @marcmolinaro for Governor and @GOPLeader for Speaker. My Democratic opponent is voting for Cuomo for Governor and Nancy Pelosi for Speaker but doesn’t have the courage and integrity to say so.
By contrast, I have fought tirelessly for Fort Drum and a robust defense budget. I support US-Canadian trade because it’s critical to North Country jobs. I have led on bipartisan fixes to our broken healthcare system to lower costs and improve qualify and access. #NY21
This election is a choice for North Country voters. My Democratic opponent supports cutting defense and cutting Fort Drum, opposes US-Canadian trade, infringes on 2nd Amendment rights, supports government run healthcare, and is a Cuomo clone. #NY21 @7NewsFox28
I strongly support mental health funding and we have delivered an $150 million increase. I was also proud to work in Congress to pass Fix NICS on a bipartisan basis. #NY21
Tune in to @7NewsFox28 at 7 pm - must watch TV when my Democratic opponent gets confused and flubs her answer (once again) on 2nd Amendment issues exclaiming “I DON’T KNOW!” in regards to infringing on our Constitutional Rights. 😳🤭
I have fought for our North Country farmers, for our troops especially those at Fort Drum, and have advocated for our small businesses and North Country manufacturers. #NY21 @7NewsFox28
Since my first day in office, I have worked tirelessly on behalf of the hardworking families in my district. Despite my Democratic opponent’s desperate attacks, I am proud to be in the top 10% most bipartisan Members of Congress. @7NewsFox28 #NY21

I commend my Green party opponent for offering specifics on healthcare. My Democratic opponent offers Pelosi talking points on government run healthcare and once again she provides no specifics. My specific solutions are bipartisan. Read more ➡️ https://t.co/anXPETKJvZ #NY21
Despite desperate attacks from my Democratic opponent - I am proud to be ranked within the top 10% of the most bipartisan Members of Congress. I am proud of the results I have delivered to the North Country. Across our 12 counties, unemployment is down and wages are up. #NY21

Good summary of today’s debate. Talks about my bipartisan results &amp; highlights my Democratic opponent’s platform of higher taxes, banning 2nd Amendment Rights, government-run healthcare, and opposition to US-Canadian trade. The only omission was her total flub on agriculture. 🤭 https://t.co/FmR37hrbF8
I am proud to be the candidate with a record of delivering results to our district. And I humbly ask for your vote on November 6th. #NY21 @SPECNewsAlbany
I support defense spending and will always advocate for resources to strengthen Fort Drum. My Democratic opponent supports cutting defense and cutting Fort Drum. #NY21
I support patient centered healthcare and have delivered bipartisan results. My Democratic opponent supports government run healthcare and wants to end employer provided healthcare. #NY21
I support our 2nd Amendment rights. My Democratic opponent does not. #NY21
I support Canadian trade with the North Country. My Democratic said she does not in this debate. #NY21
I support @marcmolinaro for Governor. My Democratic opponent supports Cuomo and he is one of her top donors. She is a clone for his policies. #NY21
I am proud to be the candidate who has delivered bipartisan results. This election is a choice and I want to highlight the differences with my Democratic opponent. #NY21
Sexual harassment is a society wide problem. I was proud to update our sexual harassment rules in the house to strengthen them. I stood up and led to ensure NO taxpayer dollars are used to settle sexual harassment claims. #NY21
I am very concerned about the addiction crisis we are seeing across the country and across our district. I have spend a lot of time with my district addressing the opioid and heroin epidemic. #NY21
I believe in increased border security on the southern border. I have been a strong advocate for immigration reform and fixing our broken system to help our North Country farmers. #NY21
I am proud to have voted in support of relief for our small dairy farms. We need to update the MPP program and increase market access. My Democratic opponent’s answer ...🤭(couldn’t quite come up with an answer as too many issues being discussed) #NY21
My Democratic opponent doesn’t support our trade agreement with Canada. I support our trading relationship with Canada. #NY21
I am proud of my support and leadership on the House Armed Services Committee. My Democratic opponent supports cutting defense and cutting Fort Drum. #NY21
I do not support balancing the budget on the backs of our men and women in tbe military. #NY21
I am proud to be the candidate for robust and strong national defense spending. I am the leading voice for Fort Drum and our military community. I do not support defense cuts, both of my opponents support defense cuts would decimate Fort Drum. #NY21
Has Andrew Cuomom been a good Governor? My Democratic opponent struggles to answer but she is voting for Cuomo. I am voting for @marcmolinaro #NY21
Lightning round!	High Peaks climbed 2! Both of my opponents have climbed ZERO!
My Democratic opponent does not support veterans having the flexibility to access care in their communities and local hospitals. #NY21 @SPECNewsAlbany
I think we need to allow veterans to access hospitals in their communities. My office has claimed over $2.8 million benefits owed to our veterans. We passed the VA Mission Act and the VA Accountability Act. #NY21 @SPECNewsAlbany
I’ve delivered $27 million to our rural hospitals in #NY21. I was the leading voice for Community Health Centers to deliver the funding they needed. I was proud to lead on the suspension of the medical device tax. And we did so on a bipartisan basis.
My Democratic opponent wants to get rid of employer provided healthcare. My Democratic opponent is also uninformed. Congress has had over 100 hearings regarding healthcare. #Ny21
Healthcare is incredibly important to our communities and I have delivered bipartisan results. I wrote the largest fix to Obamacare signed into law. I have put forth bipartisan solutions to expand coverage for primary care visits. #NY21
My Democratic opponent is beholden to Andrew Cuomo and is a Cuomo clone who supports raising taxes on New Yorkers. #NY21
I have been a strong advocate for North Country trade with Canada which is critical for our local jobs. # NY21
I support our infrastructure bill and have voted for a multi-year highway bill which supports our transportation cluster jobs in #NY21 @SPECNewsAlbany
I am proud to be the jobs candidate and the voice for our small businesses and North Country manufacturers. I am a supporter of workforce development. #Ny21 @SPECNewsAlbany
We’ve increased mental health funding by $150 million. We passed the bipartisan Fix NICS Act as well as Stop School Violence Act. #NY21 @SPECNewsAlbany
I have supported increased funding for our mental health. I am proud to have led Fix NICS and see it signed into law. #NY21 @SPECNewsAlbany
The entire North Country community and Congress mourns the loss of life this past weekend. This was an Anti- Semitic hate crime. We are seeing a rise of Anti-Semitism in our country and around the world that we must condemn. #NY21 @SPECNewsAlbany
In my first two terms, I’ve advocated for our North Country farmers, our veterans, our troops, and small businesses. I am looking forward to highlighting my record of results. #NY21 @SPECNewsAlbany

Hope all of #NY21 tunes in to tonight’s debate. I am proud to be the candidate with a record of bipartisan results! This debate was truly a disastrous performance by my Democratic opponent. Don’t miss it! https://t.co/aV1S4qtaUA
Sexual harassment is a nationwide issue. I am proud to be the leader of the initiative that will ensure that taxpayer $$ will not used to settle any sexual harassment claims in Congress once its signed into law. #NY21
I support funding to secure the southern border, especially with what is going on with the caravan. I support giving ICE the tools they need to secure our borders. I am proud to supported by our Border Agents Union, because they know I'm fighting for their jobs and security #NY21
Unlike my opponents, I will support our new trade deal with Canada. We have worked for years to get better access to Canadian markets and this deal delivers for our dairy farmers. #NY21
I am proud to support robust defense spending and be the leading defender of Fort Drum. I do not support defense cuts. Both of my opponents support defense cuts, it's wrong for #NY21 &amp; our country. I do support the Space Force because our country needs to be the leader in Space.
My office has been a strong supporter of our veterans. We have claimed more than $2.8 million in veterans benefits that were owed to them. We passed the VA Accountability Act which President Trump signed into law to ensure that our veterans get the care they deserve. #NY21
I am proud of my bipartisan healthcare results for our district. I do not think we need government run healthcare. My Democratic opponent wants an expansion of Obamacare one day, and single payer the next day. Regardless, its more government control and its wrong for #NY21
I do not support an "assault weapons ban". I represent tens of thousands of legal gun owners. My Democratic opponent does support a ban and this past weekend the @timesunion Ed Board reported that she told them that "she favors... reimposing an assault weapons ban." #NY21
I have been a strong advocate for our small businesses. Since I was elected, unemployment is down and wages are up in our district. I am proud of the results I have delivered for our district. We cannot go back to the failed policies of Nancy Pelosi and Andrew Cuomo. #NY21

Today’s tragedy in Pittsburgh was an act of hate and evil. My prayers go out to the Tree of Life community and to the entire Jewish community. We must condemn this heinous targeted act of Anti-Semitism.

My record of bipartisanship and delivering results to our district #NY21 @poststar https://t.co/2K6zkZrVFN
This election is a choice. Do we continue to focus on growing the economy, or do we move in the opposite direction of the Nancy Pelosi and Andrew Cuomo tax and spend failed policies? I think we need to continue voting for results, and I hope to earn your support. #NY21
We are facing a lot of threats, and I believe that our soldiers at the 10th Mountain Division &amp; our military men &amp; women in uniform should receive the support they need. I don’t support going backwards to the defense cuts under Democratic leadership that decimated Fort Drum #NY21
I have a strong record of independence when it comes to standing up for our environment... When my fellow colleagues in Congress wanted anti-science amendments passed, I stood with Democrats and reached across the aisle to stand up for scientific-based research. #NY21
...I think whatever direction we move in, and it should be a bipartisan one, we have to protect those with preexisting conditions, we have to allow young people to stay on their parents' plan until the age of 26. #NY21
One important topic is providing coverage for those with preexisting conditions. I supported an amendment to the healthcare bill that required insurance companies to cover those with preexisting conditions…  #NY21
When my Democratic opponent criticizes seeing a doctor twice per year, that’s a bipartisan bill. That’s a bill I am working on with a Democrat that would be a fundamental fix to the Affordable Care Act. #NY21
We need better healthcare. Obamacare is not working. We see how prices are increasing year after year after year. We need better healthcare, and I’ve been the leading voice to fix and replace Obamacare. #NY21
I put forth specific solutions, whether it's allowing small businesses to pool together in associated healthcare plans, whether it's encouraging two primary care visits per year and requiring those to be covered by health insurance. #NY21
I am concerned about our rising deficit, but I want to point out that under President Obama and Nancy Pelosi’s leadership, the deficit was over $1 trillion more than it is today. We need to continue focusing on economic growth. #NY21
According to the @NCountryChamber, small business optimism is at an all time high. That is good news. We can’t afford to turn back to the failed policies of Nancy Pelosi and Andrew Cuomo. #NY21
Since Day 1, I have focused like a laser on delivering results for you. Whether that’s fighting on behalf of North County farmers, standing up for our troops, advocating for our veterans, or working with small businesses &amp; North Country manufacturers to create jobs and grow #NY21
Thank you for your enthusiastic support! #NY21 🇺🇸 https://t.co/uivG0O5qWC
Thank you again to Mountain Lake PBS, and to my opponents. We have different solutions, but thanks for your courage for running for office in this political climate. #NY21
I am the only one on this stage who has worked with and been supported by Senator John McCain. I worked to name the bill after him. I am also proud of my work to help pass the bipartisan NDAA to support our troops and ensure the security of our nation. #NY21
I don’t support a carbon tax because that would increase energy costs for my constituents. People are struggling to make ends meet. A carbon tax would be a tax increase on my constituents and of course my Democratic opponent supports a tax increase. #NY21
Where my Democratic opponent said "it doesn’t matter where the details are..." Details do matter. Medicare for all is a government program that would cost trillions of dollars. I have seen government-run healthcare, and it doesn’t work. #NY21
My Green Party opponent and I have the courage to put out our specific ideas on how we can fix our broken healthcare system. My Democratic opponent changes her mind on whether she supports 'medicare for all' - sometimes she wants it, and sometimes she doesn’t. #NY21
My plan is to fix our healthcare system with common-sense, patient-centered healthcare to give you more affordable options. We need better healthcare. Obamacare is not working, we see prices increase over and over, I have been the leading voice to fix and replace Obamacare. #NY21
We have an authorization for use of military force, it's under the 2001 AUMF. I think it should be updated given the changes and the rise of ISIS. I think President Trump was right in action to strike Syria. I think it is strength which we didn't see under President Obama. #NY21
I am proud of being one of the strongest supporters of Community Health Centers across this district which serves more patients than Planned Parenthood. I have received national recognition for my work to protect Community Health Centers, and that’s something I am proud of. #NY21
My Democratic opponent has a record of tax and spend policies like Nancy Pelosi. When she was elected, St. Lawrence County Government had a fund balance of $23mil, under my Democrat opponent they had to borrow 12mil, 10mil, and 9mil and then still ended up 3mil in the red. #NY21
More people are working in our district and across the country, unemployment is down, wages are up, small business optimism is at an all-time high. I also helped author the NDAA which provided the largest pay raise for our troops in almost a decade. #NY21
Since my first election, I have worked tirelessly on behalf of my constituents. I am proud to be in the top 10% of bipartisan members of Congress. 	I have delivered real results for our district. #NY21
