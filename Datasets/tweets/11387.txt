@HelloAndrew @LidaJames22 @MartinFritter @cmclymer Also I called it a novella because I assume it was intended to be part of a magazine serial. But yeah, you are completely correct-- it packed a punch for being a rather short piece and honestly I didn't count the words.
@HelloAndrew @LidaJames22 @MartinFritter @cmclymer I have read it, but I think perhaps you overstate it's significance as an anti-rape trope of some sort. It seems instead that he was pessimistically assuming that most men think about raping women or that men think that's what women think about. Not sure.

@MartinFritter @cmclymer You too! I love seeing you around the twitter cesspool every now and again.
@cmclymer It‚Äôs a good point. But it runs like a hit job when they leave stories like pedophilia, rape novellas, etc. on the floor when they belong to powerful men like Trump/Sanders. In that context, I literally give no shits about her comb unless it has Russian salad dressing on it.

@IlhanMN Why are you handling this issue with such a big fist. You will only needlessly provoke and not improve dialogue at. I fear you will now be shut out and your influence dramatically impeded. It‚Äôs really too bad.
@daveweigel @IlhanMN I think this is important. The congressperson has an important concern to raise, but she can do it with much more diplomacy and consideration than she did.

@ParkerMolloy @AJentleson Some of these folks reeled in people early who, like myself, couldn‚Äôt quite grok the amount of sexism, racism, and homophobia that reared up to elect Trump.

@amyklobuchar is definitely being tested with oppo hits. All the women have been touched so far and while Warren flounders, Harris did much better. Amy can likely handle this fine. There is always a spinnable truth in these stories, but the thread to relevance is close to nil.
@HoarseWisperer To me, this is the most frightening part of the story and not being raised nearly enough. Also, the part about Bezos and the towel. That is seriously messing with me.
@NordHovland @EvilCEOE @BarackDaVote @mollyhc Agreed, if there is a story here, it‚Äôs got to have better legs than this. This feels like an oppo hit job. If it‚Äôs not, then do better reporting.
@space_case12 @ephmen @mollyhc No, I‚Äôm specifically raising the newsworthiness of this particular take on the story. It‚Äôs gossipy.
@mollyhc I‚Äôm sorry to say this, but this is not a very well written or evidenced story. It‚Äôs a stretch to draw the conclusions you are based on this angle. I know people run deep, but this story doesn‚Äôt rise to the level of publishing. Maybe it will, but it sure doesn‚Äôt now.
@Luv_My_Squishy @mollyhc I‚Äôm sorry for that. You‚Äôre not alone and it shouldn‚Äôt stand. However, that story needs a more professional treatment. It was poorly written and the headline doesn‚Äôt match the content. That‚Äôs suspicious to me and I don‚Äôt find this story credible.
@Luv_My_Squishy @mollyhc I don‚Äôt think that is a good comparison. Her performance as a legislator is responsible and completely orthogonal to this. Sorry, I disagree completely on the worthiness if the story at this level. It‚Äôs too gossipy.
