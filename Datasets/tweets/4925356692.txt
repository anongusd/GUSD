@SavedSoul1990 Nancy is the most venomous of the lot.  She hates POTUS more than she loves our country.  Nancy lives like a robber baron and can't understand why some Americans admire and appreciate Donald Trump.  She's CLUELESS.
@CallNotEvilGood @UkraineBlues @Tweets4MAGA President Trump is working to save North Korea and Venezuela.  In 24 months he will have done both.
@Trumprockplanet @Dougs1978 @superyayadize @BreitbartNews Pepple are always taking guesses about Ralph. Adopted him the humane society here in Novato.  Best guess Terrier &amp; Something Else.  Very quiet and adorable.  Say Say Hi to yours from me and Ralph!  Happy Sunday.
@Trumprockplanet @Dougs1978 @superyayadize @BreitbartNews Rich people have servants to do the darndest things, don't they?  They're supposed to anyway. I thought of the Anita O'Day/Cal Tjader song: "Peel me a grape, crush me some ice.."  Fig sounded funnier.  Just pointing out:  Pres Trump -- our POTUS  was not your typical rich kid
@Dougs1978 @superyayadize @BreitbartNews Yes, but, after he inherited his millions Donald Trump didn't sit back and contemplate his navel while servants peeled his figs.  Made himself a billionaire.  Could you do as much, Bernie?  Oh, and that other thing.  Donald became President of the United States.
@DoingRight1 @Rbigzs I'm with the bunch who believes that the climate has been CHANGING ever since the ICE AGE.  It changes when it changes and all of our garbage is debris we should be picking up, but some of us are such slobs.
@ChrisRowland9 @DeeDambrosia @AOC @RealJamesWoods THANK YOU, JAMES!
@realDonaldTrump Great, teleprompter-free speech. Stamina, among other positive and valued PRESIDENTIAL traits, is certainly what you demonstrated yesterday. You're leaving the DEMS in the dust -- ALREADY!  God bless you, Mr. President.  Wonderful speech.  MAGA!!!
@ddwiese @eemd48 "SUSPICION" and GOSSIP and INSINUATION.  Speaking of James Bond are we showing how backward we (the US) is in thinking that Russia is any kind of contender in the Super Cyber World capable of hacking us.  We're Number One!  Where's their Silicon Valley?  Russia is Bush League.
@marklutchman She's well-groomed. But intellectually, AOC is a horse-laugh and a half.
@ChuckCallesto @Leslieforlife 27% Approval Rating for Nancy.  Doesn't that mean that 3/4 of America wants her to skidoo?	https://t.co/F6yp5NgWJp
@ChuckCallesto Nancy needs to look at RATINGS.  Her own LOWER THAN LOW rating and where Fox News is in SKY HIGH RATINGS.  The compute as they did in 2016 to VICTORIOUS PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP
@marklutchman THE THREE STOOGES --- AOC, Tlaib, Omar -- should stay where they are.  As a matter of fact, I believe that all the COMIC RELIEF (i.e, Waters, Warren, Pelosi, Schumer, et. al.) should stay put.  These adults who put hatred for Trump ahead of country are the GOP's lightning sparks.
@marklutchman ABSOLUTELY NO!!!!!
@HLAurora63 @GOP You wouldn't know there are 432 other Representatives in the House.  The Three Stooges -- Tlaib, Omar AOC -- are getting way too much attention.  Maybe the other two can get BUSTED after Tlaib.  Or just NOT RE-ELECTED.
@dbongino This needs to be on a billboard in every city and town in America.  Thank you, Dan!
@RockinTrump @fantasticlegs @CNN @jaketapper Strong, steadfast and true. Trump loves his country.  Don't understand why DEMS don't.
@bud_cann Best thing is keep her in the spotlight with cameras and voice recorders running. Omar had a "game plan" when she left Somalia.  Let's make sure she's MONITORED.  BTW How much WELFARE $$$  was she awarded as an ASYLUM SEEKER from a 3rd World country? Pay the US back, Ihlan?
@KTHopkins Thank you, KATIE!  Of the THREE GRACES -- AOC, Tlaib &amp; Omar -- Omar is the most treacherous.  Here in the US, not enough of us have paid attention to what is happening in the UK.  I have in-laws in Birmingham, Milton Keynes &amp; Liverpool.  Told me about RAF Sgt Prendeville.  Groan!
@KTHopkins Same here in the US with DEMS (Tlaib &amp; Omar) as you know.  in 2008 Brigitte Bardot got fined 15,000 Euros for "inciting racial hatred" by simply stating her opinion about Muslims "destroying our country...imposing its habits." Is the US next, Katie? Would love to hear your POV.
@KTHopkins Outrageous! Do they still have TV Detector Vans in the UK that can detect the presence of a TV in the home? I was an American living in Britain in the 1970s. They did then. License for B&amp;W was 8 Pounds. Now it's $150? Would you get your dog repossessed &amp; sold in the UK, too
@LoriinUtah POTUS is coming out ahead on everything. DEMS are LUNATICS &amp; LIARS and are FILTHY RICH.  I'm taking a few months' break from Twitter for some courses at local Community College.  Classes I need have disabled ramps. Pres Trump has nothing to worry about.  2020 SHOO-IN!
@LoriinUtah @RL9631 Rashida, do your constituents ever remind you about your parents, 13 brothers &amp; sisters  who availed themselves of US welfare $$$, Section 8 housing, Food Stamps etc. Hope people who voted for you will call you Toll Free to tell you to knock off the 3rd World anti-Semitic rants.
@magastorybook @BreitbartNews Say, didn't Nancy get yanked off that bus on her way to Brussels?  Perhaps we should all chip in and show her what NO WALLS mean:  	https://t.co/hhk8WwrePS
@LaylaAlisha11 @Italianmike The more we hear from Tlaib's mouth, the more I realize what being the eldest of fourteen children means.  Asylum Seekers?

@marklutchman Rashida Tlaib and Ihlan Omar -- who swore on the Koran instead of the Bible -- have been offensive from Day One. Matching narratives on Jews was enough to make me realize that America is too good for its own good.  The other thing that was crystal clear -- these two are BONEHEADS
@marklutchman Have never enjoyed a rebuke more.

@TRobinsonNewAMP Heard your Koran book was banned for sale on Amazon.  Loved your Enemy of the State.  Chances are the reviewer who banned you has never read you. Did you happen to mention to them you've lectured at Oxford?:	https://t.co/0v6oCEKxEH
@AMike4761 The Free World is watching.  Good luck, Tommy!
@TheRightMelissa @Aramaithea @AOC It's a good thing Cortez, Omar &amp; Tlaib (sounds like a law firm) are so dense they just don't "get it" and NEVER WILL.  This is what happens when you throw fits -- especially self-righteous, indignant ones  -- and draw attention to yourselves.  The rest of us REALLY PAY ATTENTION.
@DanCrenshawTX @ilsad257 Even humane conservationists won't give up their laptops, I'll bet.  Whoever debates these Green New Deal proponents should remind them that the Green New Age is actually the Old Stone Age.  Question #1: Where do you think the power comes from that charges up your charger?
@AIIAmericanGirI @BreitbartNews Rashida Tlaib is the BEST does the best selling job for the GOP.  Who in their right mind wants to emulate this boorish, naive racist?
@marklutchman So 1970s😎
@marklutchman Don't forget Nancy's $140 million home In San Francisco, Maxine Waters' $5.5 million bungalow in a Los Angeles district she doesn't represent.  Living outside her district?  Is that against the rules?  IMPEACH HER!
@marklutchman Where Omar Should Be:  BACK ON A PLANE TO MOGADISHU!
@DFBHarvard @underwearonly Loved watching Tlaib SQUIRM yesterday.  I used to think Mom was too picky and too Japanese.  At 65 I can still remember one of her favorites:  "Be careful what you say to people. Once it's out, you can't put it back."
@thebradfordfile @my3monkees Heard Dr. Sebastian Gorka recount a call he received on his radio show earlier yesterday. DEM Caller said he turned Republican WHILE he was watching the Cohen hearings.  Backlash, Backfire &amp; Boomerang! Fair-minded, intelligent and common-sense DEMS are saying "ENOUGH ALREADY!"
@AMike4761 Rotherham, England and Sweden. Political Correctness gone mad!
@HLAurora63 @KarmaBaby100 @BreitbartNews PC Clown
@PatrioticCindy @Jenn198523 @RashidaTlaib @RepMarkMeadows Tlaib is not only a RACIST, but she is a RUBE. How DUMB can you be to think can do a "star turn" like the one she pulled and not fall flat on your butt? Heard Lynne Patton (The "Prop") a few minutes ago on Fox.  Brilliant woman whose intelligence &amp; mental balance shine bright.
@marklutchman If her father isn't supportive of his disrespectful daughter I'll just follow his lead.  Speaking of fathers was there ever a follow-up on why Dr. Blasey-Ford's father kept such a safe distance from her during the Kavanaugh hearings &amp; only wrote one terse open letter of support?
@Freeredcaz @marklutchman Strength &amp; thoughtfulness. Mom (from Osaka) has been gone since 2005.  What Mom said to me as a kid must have been my strength training. "Don't' complain," "Never mind," and "It doesn't matter." She managed to live through WWII and B-29 raids so I bit my tongue and grew stronger?
@bandmom74 @marklutchman Refreshing isn't it?  I did not vote for Pres.Trump in 2016. Hillary Clinton was repellent. So I turned Libertarian and voted for Gary Johnson. My 2020 vote will be for Donald Trump. POTUS is such a BIG breath of fresh air!
@marklutchman Yes.
@bandmom74 @marklutchman His Tweeting reassures me POTUS's heart is in the right place -- with our country &amp; his mind is in the right gear for understanding what's at stake with OPEN BORDERS. You mention "rock star." SO RIGHT.  When Kim Jong Un shares the room with POTUS,  Kim is riveted. Good call!
@bandmom74 @marklutchman Agreed.  But don't you also agree that POTUS doesn't go out of his way to be a phony. Wall-to-wall smiles &amp; glad hands. Plays well in Vietnam and Japan?  I can't count the number of times I heard complaints from Mom about certain American "habits." Especially "talks too much."
@marklutchman Tlaib is getting boring  The race card is too easy. I'm Eurasian or whatever the new term is now. Never bothered to play any race card. As a kid, I was always told by my mother "It doesn't matter."  She was right.  Don't wear any badges &amp; I don't go out of my way to be "special."
@EinsteinMaga On Conrad Veidt?  This scene moves me beyond words.  I stopped going to movies when I saw the Academy didn't care much for Marvel Comics: The Avengers.  Snobs,  So I'm TCM and old gems on Blue Ray:  	https://t.co/TNX9aZMqjc
@marklutchman I'm half Japanese. I've noticed while my Japanese relatives are, by habit &amp; custom, ebullient &amp; friendly, they seem to honestly appreciate people like Trump.  My late mother would have said "natural."  Also, not a talker or a phony. Maybe the same in Vietnam? Trump prepped well.
@EinsteinMaga You have a still from the movie. Here is the most touching scene between Gwynplaine (the man) and the blind woman he loves.  	https://t.co/TNX9aZMqjc

How do you request any news network -- say, Fox -- to interview cyber experts and ask for their thoughts about the real risk from Russia? Bush league?
@EEverythang @marklutchman And this has been documented.  Not just heresay?  Not just gossip?  And, just what is it that makes Stormy Daniels so credible.  Hate to be a doubter, but I am an old lady who's seen and heard it all.
@EinsteinMaga Is this Conrad Veidt in The Man Who Laughs?  You know in this movie he was a good guy.  You were meant to feel a lot of empathy towards him.  FYI
@EEverythang @marklutchman For example, Hillary Clinton is a proven liar as shown on CBS.  Now if you have something similar that documents Trump's proclivity to lie, please post:	https://t.co/DqOyanTaaW
@RepClayHiggins God bless you.
@jowilliams293 @MissILmom AOC or OAG?		https://t.co/ZaXTk5ar5E
@EEverythang @marklutchman Simple.  You state that POTUS is a liar.  The proof must be something that has been documented and can be easily referenced.  As in Google it.  Yes?
@EEverythang @marklutchman If it's so easy to say, it must be doubly easy to prove?  Chapter and verse, please.  As in published attributions.
@EEverythang @marklutchman Still waiting on the proof.  Everyone comes up with accusations, insinuations &amp; innuendo, but no proof.  As a Libertarian I look at all 3 sides of the political coin.  DEMS lost me in 2016.  Too much BS
@mikebwonder @realDonaldTrump On the contrary, it BOLSTERED IT BIG TIME.
@bud_cann @SandraTXAS Don't you feel encouraged every time AOC &amp; Omar open their mouths, and now Lying Michael Cohen (drenched in flop-sweat) that President Trump's second term in office is a done deal?  God bless (SC-R) Rep. Virginia Foxx BTW.  Can't say that enough.
@marklutchman Michael Cohen is not only a liar, he's a lousy liar.  It wasn't just the FLOP-SWEAT, but the fact that he waited all this time to spill his guts is telling in itself.  (SC-R) Rep. Virginia Foxx:  God bless you!
@realkareemdream @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Thank you.  Could not have said it better.  Won't any of these DEMS say, "So, Michael, you're willing to put up or shut up? We look forward to your PROOF."
@AppSame Every time some DEM states that, where is the person asking, "DO YOU HAVE ANY PROOF?"
@seanhannity Separated at birth?:	https://t.co/ZaXTk5ar5E
@mikebwonder My first question for Michael:  WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?
@DonaldJTrumpJr Yes with Pelosi &amp; Schumer keeping up the HATE TRUMP drumbeat. Wonder about their mental stability? Many Americans, inc me in Marin County, CA wonder when HATE TRUMP campaign will stop.  DEMS no longer know how to think critically. For DEMS: TRIAL BY GOSSIP. 1692 Salem, anyone?
@IngrahamAngle @DICEY63 NO
@SonyaSone7 @babysgramma @realDonaldTrump I thank God he ran. Look at the numbers.  Not manufactured. Look at the caravans.  Ask Border Patrol &amp; ICE; not manufactured. Ask Angel Moms &amp; Dads; sons &amp; daughters were killed by illegal aliens. Not manufactured. DEMS need to sober up &amp; stiffen up and stop this TRIAL BY GOSSIP
@Distinct_Words @Cocoa_Bean10 @BreitbartNews What "bigotry"? So far not one of President Trump's accusers have come up with a single example -- PROOF -- of Trump's bigotry.  What is this?  Trial by GOSSIP?
@SandraTXAS @baalter @winegirl73 @JVER1 @GaetaSusan @realPatriotDrew @SandraHartle @AppSame @mavrick803 @LVNancy @WideAwake35 A card is on its way.  Joe looks ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL.  Thank him for his services.  Gratitude &amp; Good Wishes!!!
@GCoinCollector @mjgranger1 @AZWS @ufeellucky @railboy63 In the old days, Glenn, we were told things like "live and let live" and "mind your own business." Now everybody's business is everybody's business.  If they don't happen to like you or approve of anything about you -- just like POTUS and his hair or his billions -- they attack.
@marklutchman Just watch Omar and cohort Tlaib like a hawk.  Not hard to do.  They both crave attention and the press knows to follow them 24/7. The press is already married to AOC.  The American public can rest assured that the other 432 Representatives are actually doing work.
@GCoinCollector @mjgranger1 @AZWS @ufeellucky @railboy63 I have faith that the majority of us have enough "skin in the game" that we're never going to let it happen.  In the neighborhood where I live many people have owned their homes since the 1960s including a retired SFPD vice officer. I have faith in America &amp; faith in POTUS.
@GCoinCollector As a Libertarian I truly fear for the Democrat Party.  P&amp;S are running on nothing but HATE FOR TRUMP.  And, there's the apparent LEADER OF THE PACK, AOC, who probably -- judging by her GREEN PLAN -- never read a book.  Just skimmed a lot of CliffsNotes.  Be very afraid.
@GCoinCollector @mjgranger1 @AZWS @ufeellucky @railboy63 Never seen any stats about felons who've used guns in their crimes as being or not being members of the NRA.  Not a gun owner &amp; don't plan to be. My friends who are gun owners are mature, law-abiding adults &amp; NRA members. NRA has never been the enemy. No one should hate the NRA.
@realDonaldTrump We're already seeing the ill effects of NO WALL in the EU and UK.  The WALL at our southern border makes nothing but sense.  Good luck, Mr. President.  We're behind you.  Thank you for doing your duty to the American people.  PROMISES KEPT!
@Walmart Walmart's decision to discontinue your GREETERS true?  That includes special needs &amp; senior citizen greeters? I live in Novato, CA and family goes to Rohnert Park &amp; Vallejo Walmart sometimes.  If Greeters are gone, so are we  -- family &amp; friends.
@BullPup2A @KAG4All I'm shocked.
@thehill It's good to know what they're up to even though I'm in California.  Do these two young "operatives," I mean, Representatives ever check back with their constituents at home?
@mitchellvii @madmamma4 Lovely words. God bless you.
@Lowcountry1Girl @SpeakerPelosi NANCY PELOSI:  Refused to speak with Angel Moms and Dads, slammed her door in the faces of Border Officers and ICE Agents.  		BUILD THE WALL!
@GOPChairwoman @Satch7Eddie Omar's election was  a case of stupidity and LUCK. When I started hearing about Omar and what she had to say about Jews, I figured someone must have given her an outdated -- 60 years outdated-- playbook on "How to Blend-In in America (Chapter One: Hate Jews).
@stephphilip8 @T_WWG1WGA @POTUS Can you imagine what economic &amp; employment growth (FOR ALL) there will be TWO YEARS from now &amp; SIX YEARS from today.  President Trump knows what he's doing and he's doing it each &amp; everyday.  Ask yourself:  JUST WHAT ARE THE DEMOCRATS DOING? SHOOTING OFF THEIR ANTI-TRUMP MOUTHS!
@1l611 @1jjjji Lovely thought.  I totally agree:	https://t.co/yRRiFBtZlL

@LaraeKHughes1 This is on my Bucket List.  Discovered incredible clips on YouTube.  Breathtaking!
@Smartassy4ever @BigBrotherGOD1 @SpeakerPelosi DEMS are their own worst enemy.  I'm a DEM DROPOUT from 2016.  Became a Libertarian.  Thanks to Speaker Pelosi, I predict Backlash, Backfire &amp; Boomerang Big Time for the 2020 election which President Trump will win BIG TIME!
@_Sm1ttyjr @Dougs1978 @TheDemocrats @POTUS In 2016 my friends and I (all 65+) were saying DEMS ARE LUNATICS &amp; LIARS.  Nothing has changed since then. It's actually worse. AOC is singlehandedly causing another seismic shift away from the DEM Party It was Hillary last time. This time it's the nutcase &amp; we're in California!
@_Sm1ttyjr @Dougs1978 @TheDemocrats @POTUS If I were a Democrat (haven't been since 2016), I'd look around and see who the high-profile DEMS are: Waters, AOC, Feinstein, Pelosi, Schumer, Warren, and I would be thinking -- crackpots and too old for comfort.  DEMS had better shove some saner types to the head of the line!
@RealMattWalter @Clark51Austin When "Dodging Sniper Fire in Bosnia" Hillary is back on the campaign trail for 2020, let's remind her that most Americans have seen this:  	https://t.co/TVljZV1D32
@RealJamesWoods @trumpovic02 Nancy is cracking and it is so sad.  I agree.
@realDonaldTrump Saw today's numbers.  Wonderful.  Thank you for doing your job.  It has been outstanding these past two years.  We appreciate it.
@SpeakerPelosi Slamming your door in the faces of Angel Moms and Dads, Border Patrol Officers and ICE Agents who have first-hand knowledge about the CRISIS at our southern border is NOT DOING YOUR JOB, Ms.Pelosi.
@BillBoydog @PeterSweden7 No other group has caused as many problems as Muslims.  Assimilate or take a hike.  Transport yourself to a place where they give you a big kiss  and hug and accept your burqa. You are not special. You are just like all other immigrants, like my Mom. Grow up.
@PeterSweden7 THANK GOD FOR DENMARK!
@ChatByCC @RealJamesWoods Must be like Blasey-Ford's family.  They're keeping their distance -- publicly.
@dbongino Smugness is such an easy, cheap commodity to deliver.  Like AOC's vision of the future.  Did you guys even get out of bed to dream up your brainstorms?
@ChuckCallesto @StappElizabeth Righteous.
@proffitt_judy @PatrioticCindy And President Trump is all about:  NO TELEPROMPTER
@RealJamesWoods @kmclc2016brutus Thank you, James.
@ChadIsProTrump And kissing that little girl.  Who was it?  Sinbad and Sheryl Crowe who were with Hillary on that trip?  While she was First Lady of Arkansas she would address state deputies -- the ones in charge of guarding her and Bill  -- as "shit kickers." THE WHOLE WORLD DODGED A BULLET
@ChadIsProTrump "Dodged a bullet."  That's exactly how I felt when I turned Libertarian in 2016.  Even though Hillary had to dodge "sniper fire" in Bosnia in 2008.  Oh, no. That's right. She was overly tired and made up the story. To think we could have had Hillary in the WH!

Both always camera-ready.  Sorry, being petty.  But I just can't believe people like this are responsible for RUNNING THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Heard you on Fox re Instagram.  I "violated guidelines" on  Amazon Product Reviews. On the heels on buying Lincoln biography, Shelby Foote Gettysburg book &amp; Know Your Bil of Rights &amp; giving all 5 stars I was banished. From reviews only. They still take my money.
@Caliicoder3 @IWasHrren @SpeakerPelosi Nancy also barred ICE agents and Border Officers from her D.C. office.  Thanks for nothing, Pelosi.
@RealJamesWoods Lovely printing that shows she's a fraud.  An entire lifetime cashing in on a lie.
@1776Stonewall @RealSaavedra At the helm of all this hate are Nancy Pelosi &amp; Chuck Schumer. Nancy is a sociopath -- the one to watch .Hubris will be her downfall. She will destroy herself and the DEM party. No constructive moves. Only moves that try to thwart Trump.  What a waste of time &amp; money! TRUMP 2020!
@GobAbiertoBOL @AOC Someone run over to her TV and turn off the Cartoon Network.
@NevadaJack2 They know he's going to win.
@realDonaldTrump Know NOBEL not a "done deal,"but I have strong feelings about this.  Know nothing about Koreans or Korean dictators, but you appear to have mediated with Kim as no other POTUS (including Obama) has done.  Maybe Kim senses you're not a phony. MAGA!  Good luck!
@marklutchman Me
@marklutchman It's "horrible" because her constituency -- a huge group of flesh-and-blood ADULTS -- voted Little Miss Wishing Makes It So into office.  That's what's HORRIBLE.
@RealSaavedra @GaetaSusan I hope somebody from Bartlett's Book of Famous Quotations is writing all this stuff down.  When AOC goes to apply for Queen of the Universe on a craiglist listing she'll need something on her resume.
@PDeplorablegirl @joegooding Each time Omar and Tlaib open their MOUTHS we Christians get the strong feeling something (as Mom would say) is "NOT RIGHT" about them.  Arkie girl, your bullets are exactly right as the UK and EU (&amp; Australia and New Zealand) have learned so sadly &amp; badly.

@NuinkOzen @RL9631 @robbystarbuck @SpeakerPelosi Nancy Pelosi is doing a great job alienating Democrats who are probably walking away as we chat.  Her drinking, her hatred, her robber baron ways.  Repellent woman.  HATES TRUMP MORE THAN SHE LOVES OUR COUNTRY.  She sticks in everybody's craw.  Trump will win thanks to Nancy.
@LouDobbs @JimPolk Lou, that is so encouraging.  I think people are dropping from the ranks everyday NO MATTER WHERE THEY LIVE. I'm in the SF Bay Area.  Each day there is some "immoral" nugget that drops out of the mouths of a DEM leader and it makes me happy that I WalkedAway in 2016.
@John_KissMyBot As an old school-old timer I have to wonder if her constituency voted for looks and orthodontic work. If what comes out of AOC's mouth now typifies what she had to say on the campaign trail, I'd have to guess the people who voted for AOC are as out-to-lunch as she is.
@4thGear1 @mikebwonder The only good that will come of ANYONE voting for it is that we'll know who has donated their brain to the Swamp Compost Pile.  Let's see if Bill Nye, the Science Guy, could ask her a few questions about the truism that "Nothing Comes From Nothing" and see if AOC agrees.
@cgr888 @StarvinLarry I take it AOC has done the research and is not talking through her hat.  Love to see the prospectus with footnotes and bibliography for starters.  No planes, train &amp; automobiles. It must be a doozy of a report.
@RL9631 @robbystarbuck @SpeakerPelosi Courvoisier VS shots at 30,000 feet probably explain that slouch and those sticky teeth.  Yes, I agree.  She is a disgrace.  REFUSED TO SPEAK TO ANGEL MOMS AND DADS.  Not to mention borders agents and ICE officers had her office door slammed in their faces. Some public servant!

Why is it Middle East "refugees" aren't looking for help from Bahrain, Qatar &amp; Saudi Arabia?  Or African "asylum seekers" asking South Africa, Nigeria &amp; Algeria for help?  We know why.  Because they'd probably be told to 'TAKE A HIKE."

@mauidiver1 @Caliicoder3 Didn't hear anything way back when some guy (Muslim?) got a receipt from Starbucks with the racist message written on it.  Didn't hear anything from MSM when it turned out to be a HOAX
@Fortuna78543722 @progolfdave @LisaSmith4680 @ernie_plumley @RealJamesWoods I'll bet she was.  AOC  certainly knows how to talk through her hat.
@marklutchman The plan is like AOC herself -- delusional, birdbrain nonsense.
@RealJamesWoods @JDjwhite54 Thank you, James.  While we're at it, have any of our stalwart MSM reporters -- inc  Fox -- ever interviewed ANYBODY from America's IT/Cyber World &amp; asked "How much of a threat do you consider Russia?" Our family is lousy with programmers who think Russia is "Bush League.".
@realDonaldTrump You are RIGHT.  IF DEMS had made ANY moves to WORK with you, I'd be thinking differently about them -- i.e., Speaker Pelosi. REFUSING to see  ICE Agents, Border Officers &amp; Angel Moms &amp; Dads,convinced me their inaction had more to do with HATING you than PROTECTING THE USA.
@adriandt31 @Crunk5454 @POTUS @SecPompeo @realDonaldTrump How many foreign born Muslims have made into the US? I don't worry. I'm reminded of the words of Brigitte Gabriel.  Paraphrasing:  The 99.9% of the Muslims who are good and law-abiding and good neighbors are "irrelevant."  Ms. "No Problem"  is anything but.  Keep her out.
@Bud_Doggin @KAG4All Let Bernie Run =&gt; TRUMP IN 2020!
@dbongino @AdamBaldwin EXCELLENT POINT, DAN! Would you also happen to know why Muslim "refugees" -- i.e., parents of Rashida Tlaib or Ihlan Omar -- don't have a better appreciation of the USA and its freedoms?  Why are Muslims -- in the UK &amp; USA &amp; EU -- turning out to be the houseguests from hell?
@jamesgnostic777 @gidgetgyahooco1 @100PercFEDUP "Asylum Seekers" = Welfare, Section 8 Housing &amp; Food Stamps		Don't mean to be a GRINCH, but aren't these the same people who REFUSE to work and REFUSE to assimilate?
@Aramaithea @POTUS How many other people of different nationalities and religions has the US welcomed over the decades including my Mom from Japan.  Muslims? Gratitude?  None. And we elected these two.  In England it's just as bad if not worse.  Look at Luton.

@RealJamesWoods Congratulations on two million followers.Already a FAN appreciating and enjoying you as an actor. Been on Twitter for about a year. Reassuring to know there are other people who see the new "normal" for DEMS as a big cosmic joke. I'm 65 &amp; from SF. Miss the old norms. Best wishes!
@SebGorka You said it.
@SebGorka I wonder if either Ford or Smollett own a conscience?

@Linda91255450 "INVENT a reason to impeach the President!!!" They don't have one really so they go free-form on all the stock phobias and hatreds -- left out misogyny.  DEMS are getting so desperate, they could even try flinging him out for having bad breath.  Lunch is over.  Have a great day!
@Linda91255450 Accusations? Trump is  racist, homophobic, xenophobic, claustrophobic, arachnophobic, triskaidekaphobic, halitosis?  So far, it's been NOTHING BUT GOSSIP.  DEMS' next move: IMPEACHMENT BECAUSE..well, just because we hate him. No, it's just because you're STUPID &amp; you hate Trump.
@RoryGilligan1 @Linda91255450 @dbongino US taxpayer is PAYING these do-nothing DEMS for "TRYING" to stage a coup. We pay their salaries, vacations, housing -- high-rise penthouses to Napa vineyard mansions  -- 5 star medical care &amp; they won't accept Muelller's findings if they show no collusion?  Aren't we the mugs?
@winegirl73 @ATX_PATRIOT @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump AND the busiest, most conscientious President ever.  He's not sitting in the Oval Office crying in his beer over what Chuck &amp; Nancy have to say about him:	https://t.co/aA0PkSRmqb
@realDonaldTrump It's bad in so many ways.  And, it's BORING. That's why viewers turn to FOX.  HIGH RATINGS prove it.
@RoryGilligan1 President Trump is acting like an ADULT.  Not like some bully who didn't get invited to a party.  POTUS is acting like the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES leaving those two "Hold the Mayo" Twins looking like the one-note idiots that they are.  Mr President, we have your back!
@Linda91255450 @dbongino @RoryGilligan1 Yes. With that scowling face and that BIG mouth. BTW, don't know if you had the same impression of Smollett.  As he was pouring his heart out to Robin Roberts, I was thinking, "No Mom worth her stripes is buying this. This is like an episode of Columbo:  He's the perp!"
@seanhannity Park P&amp;S in a corner with something easy to chew.
@matosortho @FounderLiberty @BarackObama I'll bet Valerie never dreamed her yearbook would come back to haunt her.  Thank God our citizens are ready for this CRAP.
@BillBoydog @dbongino @RoryGilligan1 Nancy &amp; the rest of the DEMS always overestimate Nancy's popularity.  I'm here in Novato -- 25 mi north of SF.  When I and my fellow seniors talk about Pelosi the most common comment:  "She's nuts."  Maybe other DEMS outside CA are tiring of her hand jiggling &amp; nice hair, too.
@dbongino @RoryGilligan1 I'm in Bluer Than Blue Marin County, CA and I am  sick of Lefties.  Especially PELOSI. Her fanatical hatred of Donald Trump turns my stomach. I'm a Libertarian. MSM and Nancy blaming POTUS for Smollett's arrest for FAKING &amp; LYING to CPD is NUTS. It's backlash time America!
@superyayadize @realDonaldTrump @politico Media integrity is a myth. Editors rewrite press releases for busy work. Slanted junk. Highest rated news network -- FOX.  CNN, et. al. give speeches while Fox delivers verifiable NEWS. They understand Donald Trump is an honest patriot. For our USA, they want  him to stay put.
@Boyd_2650 @Duckyv72 Words of wisdom for Ihlan, AOC and Rashida or you could say:  "It is better to remain silent and seem a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt."(Somebody's mother said it c.3000 B.C.)

@ChuckCallesto Don Lemon: EMPTY VESSEL.
@marklutchman I absolutely agree.  Hearing him being interviewed where he laid it all out for Robin Roberts, "If it weren't for the climate in our country"- kind of thing.  Devious liar.  That's what and who we can blame it on -- all Jussie.  And for what?  A BIGGER SALARY?  Sick.
@janonthemtn Sounds like Mom (Japan) 50+ years at the Presidio (SF).  First job was washing produce at the commissary, next courtesy clerk, cashier, then commissary office &amp; last 25 years in the main finance office on post. Never tell me about immigrants who don't want to work or assimilate.
@RightWingLawMan 620 Days to the  Election. 620 days for Nancy to buy a thesaurus and look up a synonym for "immoral" and lend the thing to Chuck so he can find what other English language words denote "tantrum." Pres Trump -- the fresh, clear speaker will win in 2020. Remember: PROMISES KEPT
@ReginaT01716957 @janonthemtn @BusyElves Strangely (or not so strangely considering the welfare benefits for asylum seekers in First World Christian countries) they always manage to plant their freeloading butts in the US, UK &amp; EU countries. Fancy that!  Solution: Welfare = One Month ONLY. After that:  TAKE A HIKE!
@NevadaJack2 Delusional.  Why isn't the press looking into the records of her father, Tommy D'Alesandro?  Mayor of Baltimore and known for his "questionable" moves and motives.  Maybe that's where Nancy picked up these sleazy (dishonest) kinds of moves.

@cmwarren007 My "RN" is a Registered Nurse who does home care.  Mostly outpatients who have recently left the hospital after surgery. She has a very low opinion of some of her patients -- Hispanics living in subsidized housing and have Medi-Cal (free) insurance. Go figure.
@Linda91255450 Just a strong feeling as a  65 YO  Eurasian woman (from SF &amp; lives in BLUE Marin County. Hate the condescending attitude toward Trump supporters.  All I see in Trump is a straight-talking patriot. WalkAway movement tells me POTUS support is STRONG. Joe Biden in 2020? Get real.
@Linda91255450 No matter what MSM tells us about the unpopularity of POTUS the majority of American adults,responsible ones, who make their way to the polls on election day know when they're being lied to. I live in the SF Bay Area. Even here not everyone is a brainwashed idiot.
@8richard6 @leslieau7 RN (same RN as earlier story) who does home visits for new Moms does visits to Section 8 housing. Says it's clear there is a lot of "bunking in" done in some of these units.  Sleeping bags stacked against the wall.  Multiple tooth and hairbrushes. Side income taking in boarders?
@marklutchman You are absolutely right. A lot of racism underlying that "Kumbaya" public face. Latest example for me: White RN who ONLY shops at Whole Foods. "You're not likely to run into MOBS of 'those people' with their screaming brats and those little babies with pierced earrings..."

@mccraw_birkie5 @Linda91255450 @OANN Was Omar elected to tell us about our history?  Has she checked with her constituents?  Why is it that with 435 Representatives in the House, the only 3 we hear from are 2 Muslims and a Socialist?
@RichardTBurnett Thank you giving the information on the numbers.  The same thing happened with Syrians in Dearborn and Hamtramk, Michigan.  Was Obama responsible for that as well?  Travel Ban and No Chain Migration are not unreasonable.
@Italianmike My pleasure. This is a beautiful country with a beautiful American as POTUS  My late mother from Japan? 100% behind Trump.  Straight talking and not some politician who never gets to the point. Mom would have been the first to tell you that today's DEMS are out to lunch. MAGA!!!
@Italianmike I'm still jealous.  Here's the views (it's a good video) of the ride from SF to Novato.  Johnny Mathis's brother Clem was a toll taker on the Golden Gate Bridge:	https://t.co/obv1UJNF3o
@Italianmike NO SNOW. I'm sorry to say. I envy you in Iowa.  Must be lovely.
@Italianmike 25 miles north of my hometown San Francisco.  Novato, when we moved here in 1965, was known as SFPD's bedroom. It was in the days before cellphones; officers had to be within reach. Our other claim to fame was Hamilton AFB. In 1965 we got to know what sonic booms were all about.
@Italianmike You're very welcome.  Kindest regards from Novato, California.

They steered clear of politics.

@HMLoeschMcK @sewwutnow @AOC A reporter/biographer should start tracking AOC's career from this point.  Then voters can start figuring out how a Nancy Pelosi wound up with net income and assets over $550,000,000. Politics is a funny game
@1776Stonewall @jamesho93139786 I'm in Novato, California &amp; grew up in SF. Mom from Japan (went back to visit the family in (Tokyo &amp; Osaka lots) &amp; spent 7 years in England.Trains in California? I'm 65 and from the first mention of "high speed" rail so we could be more like EU &amp; Japan I thought: "Gimme a break!"
@GOP @ChatByCC Charlton Heston: "I wish for you the courage to be unpopular.Popularity is history's pocket change. Courage is history's true currency." POTUS truly understands those words.  CH, an erudite movie star from my childhood who read both Patton and Plato. Trump is on the right track.
@1acemadsen1 The UK and EU (although Switzerland may be sobering up) know that all too well.  There's a reason why President Trump is in office.  $1 a year in salary?  God's bargain to the American people.  Let's not waste it!
@realDonaldTrump Success in 2020?  No problem.  Bigger success in 2020?  Do what you can to get rid of Maduro and his "Generals." Lip Service is all DEMS can deliver to the Hispanic community -- HUGE COMMUNITY!. Ousting Maduro &amp; his thugs gives Venezuelans back their country.
@GoboMontaco What becomes a DEM turn-off is that they have nothing to stand on. DEMS are the worst offenders of everything they level at POTUS. Besides that, they're BORING.  NO PROOF.  Same insults and accusations.  Same noise out of the same yaps -- Schumer, Pelosi &amp; Waters. Gets old.
@BradickTalia Let's not forget Grenfell Towers (London).  Overcrowded with "refugees." All anyone wanted to discuss  publicly was the flammable cladding.  No borders here; it will happen here. See stats on # illegal migrants totals:	https://t.co/rWq7v8lOQ1
@RealJamesWoods @BradickTalia UK and EU are doomed. 3rd World freeloaders get "benefits" -- free housing, free money, free food. President Trump knows this all too well. "Refugees" are using Slovenia (Melania's homeland) as a detour into the Promised Land. We won't be doing the same here if POTUS can help it.

How about Muslim men?  Especially if they're here in this country with their wives and families.  Are any social workers making sure that no "old world" customs like wife beating have been imported with these new arrivals?
@Airbornex82nd @chilllingwithme End Chain Migration. How are Somali migrants able to avail themselves of welfare, Section 8 Housing, Food Stamps and Medicaid?  "Asylum Seekers"? Then aren't they the teensiest bit grateful of the country that laid out the all-expenses paid welcome mat? Unlike home sweet Somalia?
@realDonaldTrump 16 states out to sue you. That means there are 34 states that think you're doing just fine.  Great job Mr. President!  God bless you and the USA!
@baalter @ROCKONOHIO What people do when the don't have jobs &amp; DON'T WANT TO WORK -- shout  &amp; make signs that annoy the rest of us.

@CajunChick25 @Distinct_Words We owe it to our fellow Americans -- between now and 2020 -- to make sure we all understand AOC &amp; her fans have had all the advantages but never took the time to crack open a book -- OR READ IT. Yet these are the "politicians" we'll TRUST with our beloved and FREE country? OMG!
@FasslerCynthia @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews And the common Russian citizen may only be using a dial telephone or none at all.  I'm 65 and I can't believe so many of my fellow Americans have their gears stuck in the 1960s.  Ian Fleming is dead, you know.
@AMike4761 I'll hold the door open.
@FasslerCynthia @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Yes, it is. BTW, where is Russia's Silicon Valley? Why is it we never hear of Russia's innovative work in the CYBER WORLD?  MSM and most of America give them way too much credit for being IT braniacs while we downplay our ability.  Remember WE'RE NUMBER #1. Russia is BUSH LEAGUE.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews This is my 3rd Tweet to you today, but since you mentioned it, why is it that MSM or FOX never talks to IT or Cyber EXPERTS re Russia's ability to HACK US?  WE ARE #1.  Russia is considered "Bush League."  We're giving them way too much credit AND giving ourselves way too little.
@realDonaldTrump The should all take a trip to France, Paris in particular and SEE WHAT OPEN BORDERS MEAN or at least talk to the native citizens impacted by the hundreds of thousands uninvited "houseguests from hell" they now have to host.  Bless you Mr. President for DOING YOUR JOB!
@ByronYork @FoxNews More evidence that AOC is as dumb as a load of bricks.
@realDonaldTrump Thank you Mr. President  for DOING YOUR JOB!
@MishoeJohn @AppSame @realDonaldTrump Pelosi &amp; Schumer et. al. refuse to listen to or even meet with Angel Moms and Dads, Border Patrol Agents, ICE Agents or people who live and work at the border and they declare "MANUFACTURED EMERGENCY" and inept, unconstitutional POTUS?

@Kindhearted2015 @StappElizabeth @realDonaldTrump Ihlan, we (the public) can quote date, chapter and verse of your anti-Semitic rants.  Can you give us details on POTUS's denigrating, racist quotes of any kind about any group?  We're waiting...

@janonthemtn @ReginaT01716957 @BusyElves "Adapt" as in know what to expect, especially with the relatively new (i.e., Ihlan Omar) arrivals. Can't expect 3rd World thinking to immediately figure out what's going on in a First World FREE CHRISTIAN country.  "Adapt" as in just ignore the garbage coming out of her FOR NOW.

@ReginaT01716957 @janonthemtn @BusyElves Obama? I wouldn't have a clue  Demographics for Muslims in the Midwest certainly changed during the Obama years. Google the info and get stats based on local government census collections. "Asylum Seekers" do get welfare. Soc Sec cards are needed to collect benefits.
@NoFacebookForMe Sound like me.  When I want to send greetings to in-laws in England I use stationery and stamps.  My son uses Facebook &amp; some other app for photos to send them photos. Twitter is just right for me -- short &amp; sweet. Lets me know who is going nuts and who, like POTUS, remains sane.
@ReginaT01716957 @janonthemtn @BusyElves Hope enough of us were listening.  Brigitte is a realist who approaches the Muslim problem -- and it is a problem in the UK where my in-laws live -- that must be tackled with Christian compassion &amp; "smarts."These are not your grandfather's "refugees." We have to adapt to  them.
@NoFacebookForMe Just getting my bearings on Twitter. Had a younger friend show me the ropes last month.Been Tweeting a lot but not reading many msgs. I do read Tweets now, but I try to limit my time online to breaks and first thing in the morning and last thing at night.  MAGA!
@ReginaT01716957 @janonthemtn @BusyElves We are of like minds. But it is best that we stay informed.  One of the most informed writers about Islam and 3rd World Muslims immigrating to the First Christian World is Brigitte Gabriel.  Her childhood experiences left her with an open, balanced mind on the subject.
@ReginaT01716957 @janonthemtn @BusyElves 3rd World "Asylum Seekers" from the Middle East and Africa "game us" as soon as they get here.  This woman took the UK and EU for the equivalent of $500,000.  Why did she do it?:  "Easy money."	https://t.co/fWgEyKSdID

When you stood your post during the shutdown America saw what DEMS stood for (especially Pelosi) -- taxpayer-paid vacations to HI and PR.  How is it that taxpayers got stuck with Nancy's $10,000 a night bill in HI? From our POV you are PROMISES KEPT
@DebAlwaysTrump3 But first we would actually have to change the channel over to your network.  Ratings show FOX IS STILL WAY ON TOP!
@BillBoydog @Harlan Pelosi &amp; Schumer are still holding &amp; crying over their SORE LOSER HAND. They're never going to change. Trump, they feel, is an easy target so they keep undermining and undercutting the President.  Pres Trump does not falter.  He is of one mind. To protect the country.  Thank God
@arnoldpeterso13 @harjo111 Self-serving all the way.  With every underhanded undercutting move Schumer &amp; Pelosi make the better President Trump looks.  American voters are watching Fox as high ratings indicate.  CNN -- where they make the most noise --are in the ratings basement where they belong.
@Harlan It makes nothing but sense that they are turning off more and more of their members everyday. It's a good sign, though, that the more worried and desperate they are, the more noise they make on MSM, especially CNN.
@bud_cann Yesterday on Twitter there was a story about British Subway shops REMOVING PORK FROM THE MENU.  I hope they don't start any BS litigation over here.  Didn't anyone in the UK think to put up a sign in their franchises:"IF YOU CAN'T EAT PORK FOR RELIGIOUS REASONS, DON'T ORDER IT!!!

@winstonCovfefe You are so right. I'm 65 and grew up in San Francisco.  In the 1950s and 1960s it was the cleanest, safest city. I live 25 miles away and keep my distance except for Giants Opening Day.  If the Giants, don't pick up the pace this year I may just leave SF alone forever. Memories🎶
@JackRabbit76 @realDonaldTrump Not terrorists, but they are as boring as hell.
@bud_cann @pennydevo We Americans need to be vigilant of OURSELVES.  Bending over backwards for Muslims is wrong. RAF Sgt Mark Prendeville 5 years ago was moved from a Royal Hospital  (England) waiting room. His uniform might "upset" certain groups.  Does anyone over there know how to say "So what?"
@LoriinUtah @JulieReichwein1 God meant for us to endure Omar &amp; Sanders. Test of how long can we endure listening to drivel from the left trying to convince us that they actually make sense. I used to take dictation. Only thing I hear from them is that shot of air blast that blew up your leg at the Fun House.

@dbongino That is fantastic!  POTUS is the only SANE human being in THE SWAMP.  Thank God for President Trump.
@NevadaJack2 "Needs a prescription" DUMB
@HarleyHap @TOMRJZSR Pres Trump needs to be more military tactician than game show host.  He is most certainly that.  I sent him a short greeting (a quote from Charlton Heston) which begins:  "I wish you the courage to be unpopular. Popularity is history's pocket change."  Trump is HISTORY X10!
@realDonaldTrump I have to borrow my greeting from Charlton Heston:  "I wish for you the courage to be unpopular.  Popularity is history's pocket change.  Courage is history's true currency." You have COURAGE to spare, Mr. President.  Thank you very much.  You are HISTORY!
@TOMRJZSR @HarleyHap Keep OAC out in front, visible and keep her talking.  No problem there.
@BoDavidson7 Somalia's a great place where they also like to BEHEAD miscreants.  Forgot that one.  Home Sweet Home, Ihlan?
@Alyssa_Milano As a 65 year old (raised in SF) I have known a handful of gun owners.  All were professionals -- business owners, teachers, attorneys.They took their 2nd Amendment rights seriously as seriously as they did all the laws of our land.  Felons, BTW, are seldom registered NRA members.
@BoDavidson7 @madawson74 I am so glad to hear Omar remembers that about her homeland.  Don't they also flog, stone and/or execute big mouths like you?
@BusyElves @Karen56213181 Dennis Prager called it 5 years ago for the "refugees" invading the EU and UK.  They are 'ECONOMIC MIGRANTS."
@TDAmeritrade PRECIOUS.
@dbongino AOC on working for a living in NYC:	Q:         What do you say,  AOC,  to those New Yorkers who were hoping for jobs with Amazon?	AOC:    Well, like, they could start their own GoFundMe account.
@SebGorka @LiliaNovember @NYGovCuomo @AOC Also too "dense" to understand that she should not be celebrating LOST JOBS: 	https://t.co/5rpnU56aZl

@dbongino AOC and her rants are just a distraction.  Just like in 2016 when DEMS tried to distract us from seeing what a stand-up American Trump is.  BBC even thought so:	https://t.co/BfPqVbhAb6
@_Sm1ttyjr @heyitsCarolyn Chwlsea, another DEM who can't help shooting off her mouth.  That fabulous $25 million wedding and honeymoon. Paid by the groom's family? The Clinton Foundation.  The same Clinton Foundation that rallied for funds for Haiti storm survivors.  What did Haiti get? A FABULOUS ZERO.
@AMike4761 Omar is a symptom. Look at France.  In 2008 Brigitte Bardot was tried/prosecuted for speaking her mind re Muslims.  She was simply "fed up with being under the thumb of this population which is destroying us..."  Sound familiar?  It does in Dearborn, Michigan. 2019 Paris = A Dump
@Jana__Howser @realCalebLawson 2008 FILM STAR Brigitte Bardot was tried/convicted for publicly denouncing Islam &amp; Islamification of France -- her homeland.  She was "fed up with being under the thumb of this population which is destroying us, destroying our country and imposing its habits" AMERICA: BE WARNED!
@V_of_Europe They're doing that all over the EU and especially the UK.  Native-born citizens are even being PROSECUTED for speaking too publicly on the subject.  Check out TOMMY ROBINSON on Twitter &amp; YouTube.  Even BRIGITTE BARDOT got into trouble a few years ago for speaking her mind!
@AIIAmericanGirI @FoxNews Another IDIOT who thinks he's trying to win a HIGH SCHOOL POPULARITY CONTEST! Beto, sit down and SHUT UP!

"Public Servants"?  Live in mansions in gated communities behind WALLS? Get PAID by the TAXPAYER of the USA. How did all of these lunatics end up living like ROBBER BARONS?  investigate that!
@deirdreawalsh1 @erik0015 Doesn't matter where in the US you are.  I'm 25 mi from SF (my hometown). Hang with folks my age (65). We're very vocal w/opinions about the "dirty tricks" and INSANITY fostered &amp; emblematic of the NEW DEMS -- SOCIOPATHS.  Especially Pelosi &amp; Schumer -- OLD enough to know better.
@elephantaddr Looney Tunes from the Looney Bin
@rising_serpent Love your nickname for the Drama Queen
@chowdallas @LucyLovesTrump Well said. If DEMS want to know how valuable WALLS are go to the UK and EU and find out that the more the merrier could not be less true.  "Refugees" -- uninvited and unvetted -- are the bane of native-born citizens.  Many are wishing they had walls to keep these freeloaders out.
@AMike4761 I would keep her around.  Omar is one of the many reasons that there will be more defections from the DEM fold. in 2016 it was Hillary for me.  I'm now a Libertarian ready to vote for Trump in 2020 -- a  SANE choice. He doesn't play games for profit. ONE DOLLAR per year salary
@joegooding @fortressfin @realDonaldTrump @IamMonicaRae @ChristieC733 @jjauthor @PatriotJenn @DonnaWR8 @heyitsCarolyn @My305Rita @alley167 @vaxchoiceeast @gopoundsand1234 I'm an ex-DEM. WalkedAway as soon as Hillary arrived on the scene.  Benghazi, the Clinton Foundation!  Proven liar about having to dodge sniper in Bosnia in 2008.  Addressed deputies (bodyguards)  in AR when she was First Lady "shit kickers." Had it with this out-to-lunch bunch!

Turned Libertarian (from DEM) in 2016.  I love POTUS because he reminds me of the old days in The City when (1) People spoke clearly and directly -- no PC drivel , (2) No FAKE SMILE and stagy sincerity. MAGA!
@RealJack No one will vote for him.  Beto is plastic &amp; says anything that's politically correct.  I am so glad to be out of that PC Era where nothing is spouted except Politically Correct DEM DOGMA.  Pres Trump is a big breath of fresh air.  Agree with him or not, he's clear and direct.
@seanhannity Time to remind AOC who did/did not (1) Go down to the southern border, (2) Speak with border patrol, (3) Talk to ICE agents about the "National Emergency," (4) Speak with Angel Moms and Dads. TRUMP: Yes to all of the above.  PELOSI &amp; SCHUMER: REFUSED to even see all of the above.
@seanhannity The glasses I get are for the pensive, intellectual effect.  Too many "likes" popping out of her mouth to give me the impression she is anything but a stagy pretender.  She is a one-woman soap opera.  Is everything she says  supposed to be CALCULATED to shock? Yeah, right.
@FreedomWorks @FreeBeacon The Power of GoFundMe
@adriandt31 @sherry25793049 And did Chuck Schumer ever call Obama out for having a "temper tantrum"?  Chuck has such a limited vocabulary.
@JackRabbit76 @RealJamesWoods Priceless.
@NevadaJack2 I'm staying for the whole ride.
@RealJamesWoods @Leslieforlife "...provide ‘economic security’ for people ‘unwilling to work.’'"  You mean welfare for those who don't qualify for welfare?  We already give that to every freeloader, don't we, including the newest crop of asylum seekers from 3rd World countries like Somalia?I could be mistaken.
@LaylaAlisha11 @ryanra Pelosi, for all her rabid Trump hatred, has become the least trusted and most hated member of Congress. Vanity and conceit get the best of her,, but HER HATRED OF DONALD TRUMP exposes her intent and motive.  To screw Donald Trump and NOT do what's best for this country.
@Jonteinspain Good to hear.  Much to the delight of the Left we're hearing the US is ridiculed all over the UK and EU because we elected Trump.  I'm hearing just the opposite.  "Backbone" and "brilliant" are among some of the words I hear from my in-laws.  Maybe they're just being kind.
@Jonteinspain Rotherham was a true tragedy. Islam cultivates the rape and grooming gang "culture."  Sorry to see that the UK got saddled with so many Muslims from Syria looking for "free rides." Always correct me when I'm wrong, but that's what I'm hearing from a couple of the in-laws.
@realDonaldTrump Thank you, Mr. President.  You're keeping your promise.  There is a National Emergency and we a Americans appreciate that you understand the full scope of the dilemma.  Thank you for interviewing ICE, border officers &amp; Angel Moms and Dads.. God bless you!
@seanhannity All the way!
@OrenIShiKiddo @LadyRedWave Don't you just love these PC Limousine Liberals?  They PC their way straight to a 2020 Trump Victory/!
@BAELLIS158 @ArizonaKayte @realDonaldTrump Absolutely! The REAL American voter (except in CA which is where I am and where I'm from) has not lost the ability to discern BS.  Which is why FOX HAS THE HIGHEST RATINGS. I'm 65 &amp; grew up in SF.  People used to be like POTUS -- direct, honest &amp; blunt.  Don't worry. He'll win.
@SuperEliteTexan Happy Fox gets such HIGH ratings &amp; CNN (all MSM) are left in the dust. Listened to top-of-the-hour KCBS (SF) Radio natl news which painted Pelosi &amp; DEMS as the conciliatory heroes of the day and POTUS as the oafish villain.  Declare National Emergency? Damn right, Saint Donald😇!
@SuperEliteTexan With any luck American voters will eventually "get it." No one asks: How did backward Russia (not an IT superstar) do a number on US election? Hillary lost in AR (where Bill was Gov) 30% Clinton and 60% Trump. Why were Russians needed? Too much plot! Ian Fleming not required.
@RealJamesWoods Wasting police time. Crime?
@GodFirstGina @Sundncefn I'd love to be there during the Question &amp; Answer part of the confab.  Wonder how she'll manage to blow off serious questions from serious questioners?  "I mean like I'm not up on the geopolitical framework stuff like..."
@seanhannity Absolutely YES!!! Sickened by Pelosi &amp; Schumer who've done nothing to get information about the crisis at our border including speaking with ICE agents at the border.  Look at UK and EU and their open borders.  I dare any one of those limousine liberals to take a trip to Paris!
@djcamp96 I wish POTUS would say more about the OPEN BORDERS in the UK and EU and Fake Asylum Seekers with children.  This is what the 3rd World knows they can get from the 1st World $$$$$: Mexico&amp;Central America =&gt;&gt;&gt; USA$$$	https://t.co/lJ9Q8JbWSS
@marklutchman I agree.  $$$Bribes &amp; "Incentives"$$$
@LadyRedWave @isooner President and VP of the Duplicitous Jackals Club of Amerika
@realDonaldTrump Thank you and good luck!  I admire your stamina, but most of all you equanimity in the face of your opponents -- Nancy P and Chuck S, charter members of the Sore Losers Club (Senior Citizen Chapter).  My gut tells me you will prevail.  Good Luck Always!  MAGA!!!
@TWITMO_INMATE @SpeakerPelosi @DNC @realDonaldTrump @GenFlynn “She’ll cut your head off and you won’t even know you’re bleeding. That’s all you need to know about her,” said daughter Alexandria Pelosi.  If her own daughter can say that about Mom I would expect nothing but dirty tricks -- including the 25th Amendment card to come from Mom.
@KaraMar111 @winstonCovfefe @CIS_org We, who are in Trump's corner, need to remind ourselves where this all began -- Hillary's defeat. DEMS have been holding the SORE LOSER HAND since POTUS took office. Devious jackals -- Schumer &amp; Pelosi -- are going for another try at derailment -- 25th Amendment. They will fail.
@lloyd4man When DEMS try to derail President Trump the sillier they look.  "State of Emergency?"  No cause?  Advice to S&amp;P: Watch Fox. Trump not  being "presidential"?  He's the President.  How much more presidential  was Obama during his 12 declared States if Emergency? DEMS R BRAIN-FREE
@KaraMar111 @winstonCovfefe @CIS_org I do agree.  But it is so much more gratifying to watch OMAR flinch and squirm.
@winstonCovfefe @CIS_org I say let Omar carry on.  For the reasons you list, Winston. she's already been EXPOSED as a FRAUD.  Isn't that a little like being "COMPROMISED"?  With her BROTHER?  Omar can't go down a hallway at the Capitol without having to order a reporter to "GO AWAY."  I say, let her be.
@regier_steven @seanhannity @SpeakerPelosi Gorgeous flag BTW
@regier_steven @seanhannity @SpeakerPelosi One thing we do know.  Nancy does know how to live the "high life":	https://t.co/wHovda5oDV
@seanhannity Where was Nancy Pelosi when she was invited by Angel Moms and Dads to meet with them to discuss having lost their children to illegal aliens?  Where was Nancy for that "humanitarian challenge"?
@marklutchman I AM VERY HAPPY. Correct and forthright.  Doesn't play GAMES like DEMS.  POTUS just does what is right for the country.  BUILD THE WALL!
@realDonaldTrump Every day you restore my faith in this country with your correct and forthright leadership. You, sir, are one of a kind.  BUILD THE WALL.
@Jonteinspain When I was living in UK  (I'm American from SF)  45 yrs ago the biggest worry was not forgetting: 6 pence coin = 2 1/2 new pence. 45 yrs later back home I see our countries on parallel roads =&gt;&gt; politicians with bloated salaries &amp; mosques to spare. God save the Queen &amp; Rest of Us
@Jonteinspain John, how would you gauge UK Muslim crime?  When I try to  search Liverpool Echo and Birmingham Mail on crimes I've already heard about from my in-laws, I get a "403 Forbidden" msg. No paid subscription error? OR Govt control on the extent bad news re Muslims? I don't get it.
@RealMattCouch DELUSIONAL
@Jonteinspain Thank you, John!  You sound just like one of our Founding Fathers.  Please spread the word that the United States is NOT the LAUGHING STOCK OF THE WORLD because we elected President Trump.  We are the ENVY of many because we have a leader who loves his country &amp; fellow Americans.
@marklutchman YES!!!  I'm a Libertarian (65) who's been watching POTUS do his job while the DEMS (my former party) have done everything to screw him. That's not the America my late naturalized Mom from Japan loved. I grew up in SF and it's certainly not the DEMS I remember as a kid. MAGA!!!
@Jonteinspain Good morning from Novato, CA. Saw your thumbnail bio.Your input via Twitter would be terrific to tell people what is happening in the UK.  I know what my in-laws tell me me from their POV in Birmingham, Milton-Keynes and Liverpool. My SF Bay Area is in PC DENIAL.
@phillyeaglesfa1 @tintimmymustach @gatewaypundit Chain Migration
@magastorybook @smalltownandrew How quickly Omar went from grateful "refugee" to Little Ms It's All About the Benjamins:	https://t.co/v2OwY5ezz0
@marklevinshow Omar sounded a bit more reflective and GRATEFUL a couple of years ago:	https://t.co/v2OwY5ezz0
@AMike4761 What galls me about both Omar and Sarsour?  They were both welfare recipients .  Asylum Seeker Omar had money, food stamps Section 8 housing to get her off and running here in the US.  Sarsour had her first child when she was 17 and depended on our government!  Ungrateful, no?
@Airbornex82nd @TeaBoots @POTUS My sentiments exactly.  David, you're speaking for many of us. Omar should take her 3rd World MOUTH back to lovely Somalia ASAP.
@marklevinshow Omar has worn out her welcome.  She is an embarrassment and a DISGRACE.
@BrentAugustson @PatriotSally @Trump454545 @Nunni "Asylum Seekers" most of whom depend on Welfare, Section 8 Housing, Food Stamps and Medicaid.Refuse to assimilate even down to being sworn in to court.  It's a safe bet they wouldn't pull the same BS in Somalia. Our God isn't good enough for them and yet they came here.Go figure.
@RealSaavedra @mkraju Omar is SPECIAL. First term will be her last term.
@FLOTUS Happy Valentine's Day!  Have a beautiful day tomorrow and everyday of your life.  God bless you and your family.
@realDonaldTrump Happy Valentines Day!  You're a breath of fresh air.  I am a former DEM and I see I made the right decision by the Carnival of Clowns -- your challengers for 2020 -- I'm seeing everyday.  One conclusion:  No more normal people on the Left. Happy Red Days to Come!
@steph93065 @realDonaldTrump You said it.
@Don_Vito_08 Omar operates from a 1950s playbook.  She's poison and doesn't know it.  I say let her go.  Always good for a sound bite.  She, among other Dems, will get POTUS back in for 2020.
@winstonCovfefe I don't want to see our free citizens turned into a bunch of "sensitive" rats because of the presence of Muslims.  Reading about RAF Sgt Mark Prendeville being moved out of a Royal Hospital (Kent) waiting room. His uniform might "upset certain groups"? I just want to scream.  .
@BillBoydog @bethlahem16 @Jamierodr10 @realDonaldTrump When they got MEME'ed  all over the joint, they looked like a cheap &amp; worn out  Vegas lounge act.  I'm the  daughter (65) of a naturalized citizen from Japan. My late Mom LOVED AMERICA.  50+ yr career with US govt at the Presidio. She'd have loved Trump and hated P&amp;S as we do.
@BillBoydog @bethlahem16 @Jamierodr10 @realDonaldTrump I love Twitter.  Every now and then someone will post a beautiful photo of Nancy's EXPANSIVE &amp; EXPENSIVE shot-gun shack in San Francisco, my hometown.  Good thing, too.  Now we know where our tax$$$ are going.  Dumped the DEM's in 2016.  Hillary?  No chance!  AMERICAN EVITA.
@BillBoydog @bethlahem16 @Jamierodr10 @realDonaldTrump I have faith that most Americans who vote &amp; stay on top of what's happening on our political scene -- and have a level head -- understand that something is ROTTEN in the state of not only Denmark, but in the SWILL OF THE SWAMP.  S&amp;P (aka, Mutt &amp; Jeff) =&gt;  Source of the Stench.
@Caliicoder3 @TrinaParkerCogg The Third World is an interesting place.
@JulieReichwein1 @Cocoa_Bean10 That makes perfect sense.
@Jamierodr10 @realDonaldTrump By NOT doing their jobs Schumer &amp; Pelosi (I think of them as a Vegas lounge act) see to it that they stay in their multi-million $$$ homeS, lavish tax-payer paid lifestyles. and KEEP THEIR JOBS! How does that work?
@marklutchman DECADES OF BUSINESS SUCCESS have taught POTUS to ignore &amp; downplay his critics.  Thank God for us. The world is watching while he DELIVERS on his promises to our country. DEMS have only delivered  insults, innuendo and BS accusations.  That's the only thing DEMS know how to do.
@realDailyWire @Andres43978602 Why do Democrats always fail to remember that LINCOLN WAS A REPUBLICAN?
@SUBWAY Sorry, Subway.  Just saw on Twitter  ham is being removed from your (UK) menu? If it hasn't ignore my Tweet. If it has, then I say that's ridiculous!  I'm in California, but if your Muslim diners can't just "skip the ham" by not ordering it, isn't that THEIR problem???
@kidgolferman Muslims have already started litigating for their dietary needs in the US.  How about the $100 MILLION lawsuit over the non-halal pizza from Little Caesar's in Dearborn, MI?  I say it's a racket.  And I also say, if you can't eat it for religious reasons, DON'T ORDER IT.
@Airbornex82nd @Marine1__ Send her back to Somalia. She's boring the crap out of me.
@LaylaAlisha11 @ILMFOrg Love these guys. Cory Booker, AOC, Maxine Waters, Elizabeth Warren especially.  For a senior citizen like me, they all appear to have loose bolts that need tightening. These people are DEMS' STAR PLAYERS?  I hope they just keep talking straight through to Election Day 2020.
@Lmchristi1 @superyayadize Sounds like good news all-around. Lovely portrait.  Must have known you'd be posting to Twitter,.  God bless you both.
@Cocoa_Bean10 @CJHanselman @DNC @AOC Not that I have anything against Marvel Comics, but as soon as I heard about AOC's scientific "algorithm"  for planetary peace and justice, I saw everything in living color cartoon panels with Cortez at-the-ready with her exclamation point Magic Marker.  Zowie!!
@LHatKent @rem3276 First God gave us Donald Trump instead of Hillary. Next we have the tragedy of Venezuela to wave in the face of anyone who thinks Socialism is the way to go.  God loves this country so much He doesn't want us to fail so He gave us the answer sheet with the test.What a nice Guy!
@RealJack I thought these people got paid a mint to actually work,  Not just make "busy work" for themselves.
@winstonCovfefe @gailsline @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi Check out Dearborn, Michigan. 40% of the total population is foreign-born Muslims. 80-85% of them are on welfare.
@DixieElementary Live in Novato and have always loved Dixie Elementary School. Hope your  name stays.  I'm from SF and had my elementary school name changed for PC reasons from "Winfield Scott" Grammar School to "Claire Lilienthal." This is yet another PC "correction." Sad.
@SebGorka @spond13idaho For all their accusations against President Trump have they -- MSM -- ever come up with one scrap of evidence?  I contend if they had we would be seeing and hearing it on CNN 24/7. Xenophobic?, Homophobic?  Islamophobic, Misogynist? Something tells me they don't have the "goods."

@D1v5C @emtee2355 These old coots hate Trump more than they love our country.  Can't we just park them somewhere where they can't do any more harm?
@RealJack @SL1733 The sooner the better.  You can take the woman out of the 3rd World but you cannot take the 3rd World out of the woman.
@realDonaldTrump GREAT EL PASO RALLY! Your presidency has been the most eye-catching in history.  The world watches you 24/7.  Mostly we see you working and talking to the American voters.  Thank you very much, Mr. President!

Since you're there and I'm here in Novato, CA  please confirm what I've heard from my in-laws.  "Refugees" are mostly welfare recipients who are  housed in council housing when they arrive?  UNFAIR!
@ROCKONOHIO @KAG4All @Trump454545 @pinkk9lover @Mjhall412 @AppSame @TheTrumpLady @GaetaSusan @ChooseToBFree @LVNancy @ColoradoGirl2A Look at the UK.  They just turned their backs for 10 years.  London and Luton both have Muslim mayors.

@emtee2355 @McguireScotty Anyone else getting weary of DEMANDS from Muslims? Other groups -- ethnic, racial, religious, etc.--have immigrated to the US and other First World Christian countries and they ADAPT--inc my Japanese Buddhist Mom. What she didn't want, she skipped.  What's so hard about that?
@Saphina77 @ShaunPBrown @POTUS Heartfelt condolences.  God bless you and your family.
@TWITMO_INMATE @karli_bonne Phoney Baloney
@marcbrooks111 @Alanmillett3 Pope must have known someone like AOC when he wrote: "A little learning is a dangerous thing."
@nancy_hamm1 @Theresa25882205 In my 65 years I've only had one work encounter with someone from the 3rd World.  Like Omar, this co-worker was anti-Semitic. Wanted to know if a name on a list was a "Jew name." That woman was from Zimbabwe.  Omar is from Somalia. Same rhetoric from another 3rd World country?
@LucyLovesTrump @robertdunlap947 Love it because they are open and obvious about their HATRED.  These two are finding out that their 3rd World rhetoric FAILS in the FIRST WORLD.  Don't ever let them shut up.
@MLSCLM4 @SheForest AOC's quote: Spoken like a person who doesn't have a billion dollars. That I believe is the reason for the lunacy from Pelosi, Schumer, Waters et. al..  POTUS has $3 BILLION and they have a few paltry millions. Nancy's net worth is around $140 million. Envy pure &amp; simple.
@Americais4us @Jacquel42750745 Accommodation is one thing, but let's not get carried away.  The story of RAF Sgt Mark Prendeville is 5 years old.  It disturbed me when I heard about it (I'm in Novato, CA) by word-of-mouth way of my in-laws in Liverpool, England:	https://t.co/OAkjivScR1
@BorderNarcotics @SSGDJDaily The people of the EU and UK are extremely envious of the US because we have POTUS who believes our borders are worth protecting.  Let a few RICH liberals take a trip to Paris or London this year or before 2020:	https://t.co/aNXlXPn7Ec
@charliekirk11 @Jacquel42750745 Sept 2015 Dennis Prager told us about Europe's need for a wall.  We (actually OUR CONGRESS ) should start heeding the words of Charlie Kirk and Dennis Prager:  	https://t.co/yauHwEREi8
@DanMuskin @stoner_ida One-woman side-show.
@realDonaldTrump As with many of your supporters, I feel Dems should continue doing what they do best - being 100% anti-Trump.  They are their own worst enemy.  Warren is a side-show. Pelosi with her hand signals at SOTU was like a dog trainer tossing cues to her subordinates. Obvious &amp; sad.MAGA!
@DreonQua Welcome aboard to the sane side of the ship. I dumped the Dems (I'm 65) in 2016. I'm from San Francisco. I knew my party had gone nuts thinking Hillary was a suitable candidate for POTUS.  I'm a Libertarian now. If Pres Trump keeps doing a great job, I'll formally go GOP in 2020!
@Distinct_Words @DreonQua Thank you for sharing, Distinct Words. Having President Trump in office causes Dems to show their true colors &amp; how they act like gangsters.  When you see Dems looking for guidance in a crowded House during SOTU from Pelosi on when to STAND or SIT, you know it's BAD. BOW-WOW!
@MollyV178 I'd like to also add someone who is sane enough to have honest emotions &amp; not rely on signs from their Fearless Leader (Pelosi) as to when they can stand up and clap during the SOTU Address. Just had Watters World on. Humiliating! These are FREE AMERICANS or Brainwashed Zombies?
@MollyV178 @louieesqueda1 Electing a sane person.
@birdman8272 @loves_nra All of them are proof that God has a sense of humor. Voted for Elizabeth Warren.  She thinks if she pretends hard enough the world will go along for the ride. Tiger Lily from  Peter Pan was all aboard the Neverland Express  this morning in Massachusetts.There goes God again.

@Chrisconsrv1776 @stephphilip8 Excellent point.
@Liz_Wheeler @Jali_Cat Not long ago, Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana characterized Nancy Pelosi as having a "billy-goat brain and a mockingbird mouth." AOC is a carbon copy of the Mighty Pelosi.
@DianeLong22 @BigBrotherGOD1 Arkansas -- her home as First Lady of the State for 12 years -- voted 60% for Donald Trump and 30% for Hillary Clinton in 2016.  Her Middle Name:  "Can't Take a Hint."

@Reblyn1963 @Cali_Tracii @RepAOC Nicely put.  I have the same thought whenever I see Don Lemon.
@dbongino Plato must have known one birdbrain like AOC:	"An empty vessel makes the loudest sound, so they that have the least wit are the greatest babblers."

People haven't changed since Plato's day because Plato also said:"Wise men talk because they have something to say; fools, because they have to say something."
@greg_price11 All Dems, especially AOC = Empty Vessels
@RL9631 @darhar981 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @RepAdamSchiff Could not have said it better! Words that came to my mind with Pelosi &amp; Schumer:  COMPLICITOUS JACKALS.  Dirty tricks every step of the way.  I'm a 65 year old female. Not the Democrats my late mother, a naturalized citizen from Japan, loved and admired. These Dems hate America!
@RealJamesWoods Thank you.  I thought it was just me.
@inittowinit007 Love your praying hands.  President Trump will be reelected in 2020.  Democrats, headed by Pelosi, are nuts.  Their leaders, Pelosi and Schumer, are too consumed with hate for the President that they don't see how many of their own are dropping out.  Thank God!
@realDonaldTrump Second thank-you note for that excellent SOTU message.  Since then I've watched and listened to Fox News and its commentators.  Dems were childish exhibitionists. Not the grown-ups their constituents thought they had elected I'll bet.  You, sir, Trumped them all!
@inittowinit007 @lilbulli1031 @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @POTUS @RealJamesWoods @DonaldJTrumpJr @MaladjustedCre1 @PamB60 @BCMsolt @buzzman888 @realtalkbtr @ReneeCarrollAZ @RealMAGASteve @Q_101_X @Daisy49103 All of Pelosi's outward rancor and childishness does not serve her party well.  It's backfiring.  It will continue to backfire until she (and Schumer) sober up and start acting like grown-ups.
@DavidWohl @cajunhusker Ashamed to admit I'm half-Japanese. Maisie's comment during the Kavanaugh hearings made zero sense. Imagine thinking you're doing your public service as a well-paid public servant telling males (1/2 your electorate) to "step up and shut up." Sign on her door:  Genius at Work.
@TejasPsycho @karli_bonne @AOC @SpeakerPelosi ZERO FOSSIL FUELS not only means no jets  and no trains unless you don't mind them bumping in to one another w/o Radio Controls. Charging ANYTHING begins with fossil fuel. CLEAN GREEN solar panels? It took fossil fuels to produce them and transport them to your house, AOC!
@fedupcitizen16 @robertdunlap947 I know it's considered racist to ask, but I'm old  so I'll ask.  If First World Christian countries, especially this one, are so vulgar, reprehensible, satanic and crude, what the hell are you (Ihlan Omar) doing here?  Are things that much better in Somalia? Just thinking.
@thebradfordfile @LiliaNovember Grew up in SF just outside the Presidio. Mom bought a house in Novato in 1965 where I've lived mostly since.. A world away (25 miles N). Have friends who also grew up in SF who call Nancy a Carpetbagger (she's originally from Baltimore). We agree she's ARROGANT, SALTY AND RUDE!
@RonBeaubien Love Twitter.  I'm a senior citizen, part-time construction company bookkeeper.  Temporarily disabled. Happy to see so many normal people Tweets.  I'm 65 (SF Bay Area). Thought all the normal people had gone to ground.  Happy Thursday to you, too!
@dbongino Squirrel.
@RealSaavedra @Jane_the_Deplor Thank you for the warning.
@BarbillonLe @tenaciousT0286 @iamkerrilee As a senior citizen I think all of this nonsense from the Dems, meant to embarrass President Trump, will backfire on them. Trump is steadfast, unflappable and keen to do what is right for America. All voters, by 2020 will have had plenty of time to reflect on Dems' treachery.
@Saoirseuna7 @GaryDWalters3 I've never felt so ashamed for another person before.  A total stranger to me. Another female.  Another American.  Her contempt for President Trump has never been a secret but couldn't she for one important night just have tried to act her age (78)?  Senile perhaps?

@tenaciousT0286 @TG2TruthSeeker Daughter spilled the beans on Mom.  That is Nancy's "sarcastic" way of clapping.  I thought there was something physically wrong like carpal tunnel tightening.
@seanhannity Excellent. Covered important topics well and was unafraid to let the world know where his priorities lay  -- our country and the safety of its people.  Pres Trump was steadfast and unruffled by the childishness of Dems who wanted to show him up in front of Fearless Leader Pelosi
@SheriffClarke @1Davie1 Elizabeth got all the Affirmative Action goodies that went along with lying about her ancestry.  Thought no one would ever notice.
@M_COVFEFE @PoliticalGracie @dbongino @SenWarren I look at Fauxcahantas and Dick "Stolen Valor" Blumenthal and wonder how these two out-in-the-open phonies can stand themselves let alone be around people (their congressional associates) who know what liars they are.

@charliekirk11 @Mikehols704 Brainwashed.  Not able to think for themselves.  Good in front of a camera, though.
@buzzman888 @americawins49 @AOC AOC is in a nether world of "I'm so damn perky and cute I must be scoring big time" that she doesn't understand that many old-school types find her vacuous, under-educated and annoying -- an empty vessel. BTW does Alexandria make it a point to seek the limelight daily?Worries me.
@RealSaavedra Thank you, Ryan.  I heard it on Hannity after the address.  CBS Poll -- no less -- had the approval rating on the speech at 75%.  These jackals -- I mean, Democrats -- had better sober up.  75%-76% approval means Dems don't have a clue as to how popular President Trump is.
@realDonaldTrump Excellent State of the Union Address.  I'd love to see the Nielsen Ratings tomorrow morning.  Everyone I know was watching it.  Thank you very much, Mr. President.
@realDonaldTrump I never worry about the Trump Approval Rating.  It's consistently around the middle.  What I'm much more interested in is the Pelosi Approval Rating.  The last time I checked it had gone down to 28%.  Sounds fine by me.
@marklutchman Senior citizens like myself.  We've been watching the Democrats playing with the public, our values and our interests.  President Trump in 2020!
@JTrentkemp1 @flyby2474 @StacyAbrams @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Stacey's schtick is totally predictable -- all anti-Trump adjectives.  Lil Miss Echo of Chuck Schumer.  POTUS's message will be facts, real people and a report about 2 years' successes in the economy and employment.  Pres Trump's love of the USA will come through loud &amp; clear.
@seanhannity By now you have to figure that many Americans have had a gander at Nancy's famous in-flight bar tab that totaled over $100,000 tax-payer paid.  Not making any sense goes with the thin air of being Speaker of the House.
@Liz_Cheney @GaetaSusan @SpeakerPelosi @LeaderHoyer Districts represented by these women are heavily Muslim. Trend?  POTUS is not being racist paranoid or xenophobic when he states he wants to control Chain Migration and a Travel Ban.  Dearborn, Michigan is nearly 50% Muslim now and 85% of them are welfare recipients.
@EdmundHulton @TheWave0079 Thank you, Edmund.  I don't know if you're familiar with Tommy Robinson.  Tommy and his hometown Luton, England are worth checking out on the net, especially YouTube.  No borders?  It's grim.

@realDonaldTrump Looking forward to your State of the Union Message.  You've been delivering on the promises you made during the 2015-16 campaign.  Thank you so much! Signed, Grateful Senior Citizen from Novato, California   P.S.  BUILD THE WALL!
@vickibazter @PrayLuvWorkSing Obamacare was (and is) a disaster.  I (I'm 65) had my private insurance dropped AND my Primary Care MD -- one I'd had for 35 yeas ) DROPPED ME.

@wdunlap @SLBCTexas @ananavarro "Losers" = Democrats	Wayne Dunlap, the Left is drowning in its own hate.  Especially Pelosi.  This irrational, obstructionist hate is all that Pelosi and Schumer will be remembered for in the pages of history.  Oh, and those huge in-flight bar tabs paid by taxpayers.
@Caliicoder3 @Jali_Cat @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS Pelosi &amp; Schumer (especially Pelosi) are drowning in their own hate.  They'll go down in history for two things -- obstructing the wall and hating President Trump.  Never did anything good for the people of America.  Shame.
@Thomas1774Paine @WvTrump If Schumer and Peosi, were smart enough to do their jobs declaring a national emergency would not be needed. Both hate POTUS because he's vastly richer and smarter than they are. Let's stop catering to these hateful robber barons. S&amp;P have alienated 1/2 the country, including ME
@Tweets4MAGA @AMErikaNGIRL07 Cory Booker would have us believe he "rose up" from the depths of Newark to become the man he is today.  Maybe his IBM exec parents may have helped give him a boost and would  have something to say about this PR BS or Cory's active imagination.

@RealMAGASteve @heyitsCarolyn Pelosi now has a 28% approval rating.  Her erratic temperament and behavior is why.
@marklevinshow Someone please remind her she doesn't live n Somalia anymore.
@darhar981 Just like the Red Hen owner who threw Sarah Sanders out of her restaurant this guy deserves to go out of business.  You two are not simply lousy Americans you are also lousy business people.
@marklevinshow Yes.  If Omar keeps this up her new middle name will be "Single Term."
@JackRabbit76 Blatant Chuck &amp; Nancy.  American voters are following these two complicit jackals. We're watching President Trump's triumphs with economic and employment/unemployment numbers while we watch those two sizzle and writhe. They have no way of winning. The world is watching.
@Landslide1973 @RedPillBlackMan Chances are Stacey is a diabetic among other things.
@my3monkees @LadyRedWave @CNN @nbc @ABC @MSNBC Should be a negative number. Nancy is her party's worst enemy. Taxpayer-paid vacations, USAF jets for junkets with family &amp; friends, $100K in-flight bar tabs and last but not least her HATE TRUMP CAMPAIGN which shutdown the government and kept 800,000 workers from getting paid.
@DBloom451 @karliesl @SpeakerPelosi Before I became a bookkeeper, I was a medical typist who at times took dictation. I agree with your assessment. Someone on Fox the other morning said she has the "occasional lucid interval." Not enough for my money. Liars can't speak/think straight. President Trump certainly can.

Let 'er rip!
@chuckwoolery @BrocatoJoan Nope. Nancy has an acute case of TRUMP HATRED.  Great that she doesn't hide it. (1) She will not even sit down and negotiate with the Pres Trump or (2) give explicit, cogent reasons why not THE WALL.  Everyone DEM &amp; REP inc all those furloughed govt workers! They watch her, too.
@DGPurser @lynngermaine P&amp;S and the Dems will pay for their sick hatred of POTUS in 2020.  The American public is watching all their non-action &amp; lack of offering info or well-reasoned reasons about their refusals to agree to a WALL.  It's mainly Nancy who could be looking for a way to unseat Trump.
@MikeZito9 @Sekusa1 Pelosi, leader of the Dems, won't explain the reason or the reasoning behind her refusal to build the wall. Is it that she won't or she can't? Incompetent? POTUS has testimony from border officials, ICE, Angel Moms &amp; Dads, etc.The Americans Nancy REFUSES to see -- SOME LEADER!
@mloftus11 @DiamondandSilk I agree Mike Loftus.  Way too much remembered with two attackers and way too much being said.  Won't share his phone records with police.  Mike L. that does ring a little strange.  So many cameras around everywhere.  They'll find out something soon.
@realDonaldTrump I don't think anyone should pay attention to any polls. Here I am in Novato, CA (25 mi N of SF) just having left a group of my fellow seniors.  We loved you last week and we love you this week.  Pelosi?  We think she's a "head case."  BUILD THE WALL!!!  MAGA!!!
@LindseyGrahamSC Heartens me to know that Lindsey Graham is in this world and loves our country as much as POTUS.Those  robber-baron ruminants -- Schumer &amp; Pelosi -- couldn't care less about the US or us.They just want to show the world how much they hate Donald Trump. We get it  Build the wall!
@DLoesch @JimPolk Thank you, Dana. How many representatives do we have in the House? 435?   3 newbies -- Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ihlan Omar, Rashida Tlaib -- who are blabbermouth know-it-all's. None of them do their homework.  Cortez knew zero about Howard Schultz's past. Single terms, anyone?
@gregrharvey @monkeyMagaKAG Sarah is so right.  Judging by the Pay for Play habits of Hillary Clinton this country would have sold to the highest bidder months ago.  Saudis had shoveled millions into the Clinton Foundation just prior to the 2016 election.  We were spared.  President Trump loves our country.
@DFBHarvard @BrocatoJoan At least, Daniel, Omar is out in the open. Plain stupidity? Recently I had a conversation with a woman from Zimbabwe who "needed" to know if a name (she had a roster page) if that name she pointed to was a "Jew name." Short conversation. Figured she'd read a 1940s USA playbook.
@John_KissMyBot Whenever I see Schumer &amp; Pelosi I think of that old saying:  "It is better to remain silent and just seem a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt."
@AylaForTrump @Satch7Eddie One of the reasons old-school Democrats are finding reasons to defect is AOC.  Too squirrelly with her taxation brainstorms and how SOCIALISM is the cure for all our country's ills. Warning alarms went off for me when she started doing daily "star turns."  WHERE'S HER OFF BUTTON?
@francisijohn @AlisQ45 @USAMP05_RET @StormIsUponUs Thanks for pointing that out, Jan. Never knew.  Considering how Muslim populations in Midwest cities have bloomed since the mid-1990s (due to chain migration) the US might want to try a little Travel Ban.  Oh, that's right.  President Trump thought of that already.  Thank God.
@SarahPalinUSA @nick_mangene Pelosi &amp; Schumer  -- they're like a lounge act, aren't they? -- have been making all the wrong moves from the first day Trump took office -- sour grapes. Stacey Abrams will probably go into some schtick about POTUS being racist. Big surprise. These clowns are so predictable.
@StatesPoll Heartening to me -- a former Democrat who threw up her hands in 2016 -- is that there are so many Dems coming out for the 2020 race who need their bolts tightened.  If they keep doing selfies and impromptu videos showing us their fake "genuine-ness" Trump should have no problem.
@ChuckCallesto Democrats are getting desperate.  So obvious, too.
@RyanAFournier Thank God, sanity returns to our government.  No more playing Nancy's vanity sweepstakes.  Just because she hates President Trump our country -- those 800,000 government employees -- were made to suffer.  KICK HER OUT!   Hope this isn't a joke.
@KAG4All @GaetaSusan Kamala's behavior with Angel Moms and Dads, hearing that the word "God" is to be expunged from the oath and then there was Rep. Rashida Tlaib being sworn in on the Quran (albeit Jefferson's copy) that's a lot for many Americans (including me) to swallow. Trump in 2020! MAGA!
@realDonaldTrump @SONOFOLOV @IngrahamAngle Yes, it is, Mr. President.  Thank you very much for all your hard work and staying in your office. Most Americans aren't buying the bill of goods the Dems are peddling.  All of their noise truly "signifies nothing."  Our economy, unlike Venezuela's, is non-stop to the moon!
@LucetVeritas @DanCovfefe1 @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump When does Nancy ever get around to doing her job?
@ChuckCallesto It's about time!
@NationalistCody @CB618444 I'm a believer in Climate Change only because climate is always changing. As for speeding up the process the First World should accept most of the blame.  Incineration of some sort is always going on, mostly getting rid of the waste we've created.Simpler times were cleaner times.
@RedwoodCU @realDonaldTrump Love MY credit union. I have been a member for many years. Always terrific service here in Novato. Thank you so much for taking care of our community especially those affected by the October 2017 fires and the recent government shutdown affecting government workers.Bless you all!
@seanhannity The indestructible Nancy Pelosi, of course.  31 years since she was first elected to Congress.  Spent every day of it gaming the system and no one has come rapping at her chamber door at 5 am with a warrant.  She denies the American people a WALL and no one stops her.  SCARY.
@superyayadize @alley167 Someone should add up the cost of all these lovely junkets since the start of her career and ring up a grand total.  She was first elected to Congress in 1987.  Must be a whopper!
@who_wah Most Americans, me included, wonder what happened to "normal" Democrats.  As you've said they've all turned into "sociopaths." Tucker Carlson's "Ship of Fools" lays it out beautifully. Overpaid and vainglorious, they actually feel entitled to their bloated salaries and our VOTE.
@J4Trump2020 @patni1111 Such an evident contrast between "$100 000 In-Flight Bar Tab at Taxpayers' Expense" Nancy and Teetotaler Clear-Thinking and Clear Speaking POTUS.  The reason Nancy scrapes her teeth with her tongue is the sugar from the booze.
@MegsluvsMurica @KAG4All Sanity in the EU at last!
@THEHermanCain Dems are way too busy playing at  and preaching POLITICALLY CORRECT NONSENSE that they are driving off too many traditional Democrats who are now once-and-for-all convinced that the party has lost its marbles.  TRUMP IN 2020! He is as real as it gets. We old-timers like that.
@CajunChick25 @crimsonfaith88 Keep Hillary away from the White House!  Encouraging that no one was showing up at these "town hall" events with Hillary and Bill.  But then Hillary pops up and hints MAYBE?  REMEMBER BENGHAZI! The blood of 4 dead Americans 100% are on Hillary's hands by H.C. NOT DOING HER JOB!
@ChuckCallesto @BruceWhte The Wonder of Me
@JasonSCampbell 65 years ago I grew up in SF. Mom was from Osaka and widowed when I was 2. Spoke  English &amp; Japanese at home. Outside our apartment, it was "English only. This is America and you are an American." Jason C. you couldn't be more wrong. ENGLISH IS THE NATIONAL LANGUAGE OF THE USA.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Average voters are mature &amp; sensible. I'm one of those garden variety types who asks herself, "Where's the proof of all this misogyny, racism, homophobia, xenophobia, etc.  If it exists, why aren't we seeing it 24/7 on CNN?  Garden variety GOSSIP on a LOSER NETWORK, that's why.
@realDonaldTrump Redwood Credit Union in Santa Rosa made help available to government employees during the shutdown. RCU is always stepping up to the plate In emergencies as they did with the catastrophic fires including the Tubbs Fire in Oct 2017.  All-around great neighbors!!!
@seanhannity If Pelosi declines their invitation as she did with the Angel Moms and Dads, let the American Public (Voters) know about it on your show, Sean.  Nancy Pelosi is utterly useless along with her Partner in Crime, Chuck Schumer.
@DFBHarvard The US is definitely #! in the Compassion and Human Rights Departments.  UK is a close second.  As many know, the UK and EU are having migrant problems similar to ours  Here's Katie Hopkins (columnist) with a British POV:	https://t.co/aru3HFvuce
@my3monkees @clarissamehler Rep. Omar is one of the reasons POTUS is trying to curtail chain migration.  Several Midwest cities are over-represented by Muslims, Omar's district is one of them.  After hearing what this newly-arrived Rep. has to say about Jews and ISIS, I'd say the President has a point.
@Cali_Tracii @smalltownandrew @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Ian Fleming has been gone for awhile now and there are still Americans who think we have something to fear from Russians.  IT World? Nyet. This is the 21st century.  Where is their Silicon Valley?  Plenty of billionaires but little improvement in the average standard of living.
@stephphilip8 @darhar981 As an "old school" fan (I'm 65) of real news it irks me reporting now seems little more than opinions ad nauseum. Never sure the writer believes the opinion. If it's anti-Trump, it passes as credible. Zero facts or measured reasoning. Like Joy Behar venting through her blowhole
@realDonaldTrump @AngeleStar11 Mr President you should say more about the NO WALL situation in the EU and UK.  Here is a YT clip of "refugees" leaving Slovenis (Melania's home country) and entering Austria.  Do not cave.  Build the wall!	https://t.co/D8806JbaLk
@V_of_Europe That's happening everywhere in the EU and the UK.  Criminal offense, it seems, to even hint Muslims are somehow involved in crimes.  Political Correctness gone mad!
@JustTom076 @SpeakerPelosi Just watched that, too.  Aggravating.  Hope this, and other Dem non-opinions and non-actions like it, cause Dems to WalkAway as I did in 2016.
@mitchellvii @lorikmartin2 Beautifully said.  President Trump calls everyone's bluff.  Just like Mom.
@RickRainmaker77 @lorikmartin2 A man whose net worth is ONLY $900,000.  The look on Schumer's face is when he hears that President Trump's net worth is $3.1 BILLION and that's with his yearly salary of $1 (ONE) dollar.
@RealJamesWoods You asked why Japan has blocked Muslim immigrants.  Why can't we ask that of rich Muslim nations such as Oman, Qatar and Bahrain?  I think this was one of Trump's questions early on. AND, why don't those "refugees" run to those ME neighbors instead of UK, EU, USA, Canada &amp; Japan?
@RealJamesWoods Thank you, James Woods.  I'm 65 and half-Japanese.  My late Mom was from Osaka. The Japanese do not like:  Impolite People, Lazy People, Stupid People, Opportunistic Liars, Freeloaders.  Japanese people are extremely polite, kind, generous, BUT THEY ARE NOT STUPID.
@RealJamesWoods Lied and turned a profit.  Has anyone checked out Dr. Ford's GoFundMe account?  Here's a woman whose family (blood relatives) have kept their distance from Christine.  Her own father wants nothing to do with her except for a cold (non-ringing) endorsement of his daughter.
@ChuckCallesto Can President Trump learn any lesson from Chuck "Small Potatoes" Schumer?  POTUS's net worth is $3.1 billion.  Schumer?  A paltry $900,000.  Looks like Schumer should be the one taking "lessons."  Maybe that's the reason behind Chuck &amp; Nancy's animosity.  They're jealous.
@okWessler5 The reason why, Wesley Adams: Can't be bought, won't be bullied and LOVES HIS COUNTRY.  Won't be whisked off to an all-expenses paid (paid by US taxpayers) junket to Hawaii &amp; Puerto Rico.  Stays in the Oval Office, works and WAITS FOR DEMS TO SHOW UP &amp; NEGOTIATE.  10 steps ahead?
@PhoenixGRIT2Cnt @GrizzMaestro @realDonaldTrump @bing @AppSame @DavidJHarrisJr @AMErikaNGIRL07 @TheTrumpLady @cjlovesamerica @w_terrence @ReneeCarrollAZ @pogoboii31 @SandraHartle Our MSM  (I'm in the SF Bay Area) want us to believe that the USA is the laughing stock of the world because of Pres. Trump.  I have relatives in England and Japan.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Uncontrolled migration? NO WALLS? See YouTube: 'Migrants" "UK" "EU"
@Lowcountry1Girl @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi @chuckschumer Limited vocabulary.  Pelosi every other word is "immoral." For Schumer "temper tantrum." For Trump "biggest," "highest," "greatest."  Past 5 weeks Americans have had an earful from all three.  Americans know who to blame for the shutdown. Trump: "Let's negotiate." S&amp;P:  "NO!"
@TrumpPence45 Good luck to you, Mr. President. Thank you for standing fast.  Rep. Steve Scalise had an excellent idea.  Heard him on Fox.  If Chuck &amp; Nancy don't follow through on doing their jobs, give the SOTU Message from our Southern Border.  McAllen, TX Great job!  MAGA!
@MrWyattEarpLA @KLC22296984 P &amp; S's duplicity is out in the open and visible to all. It doesn't matter how much they yap about the shutdown being Trump's fault, American voters -- Republican and Democrat -- know better.  P &amp; S have always been the culprits holding up the works. POTUS is the only sane one .
@TG2TruthSeeker @averagerepub Phrase that came to mind when Donald Trump campaigned in 2016 was "Breath of fresh air."  None of this PC drivel double-talk.  Clear, direct speech and there's never been a doubt in my mind that when POTUS speaks he means what he says. Never tries to pull a fast one.  MAGA 2020!!
@mailopened @Donnam8470Donna @SheriffClarke @CNN @nytimes @washingtonpost Wow.
@LindseyGrahamSC If you had a fan club, I'd join I'd join it.  Thank you for being there &amp; like POTUS doing your job.  Saw you on Fox just after President Trump's address.  You both give me hope.  I'm in Novato, CA but once lived in England. Bad news in the UK. Build the WALL.
@realDonaldTrump My late mother from Japan worked for the Federal Government for just over 50 years.  I know what she would be saying to you today were she here:  Great job, Mr. President! BUILD THAT WALL!
@Dawn_DeMore1 @lilibellmia @realDonaldTrump Found this down yonder here on Twitter.  Details plus the bar tab:	https://t.co/kJTUpC6y2S
@marklevinshow Embarrassing.
@darhar981 @Sweet_PeaBelle Ocasio-Cortez, Warren, Harris, Booker.  I'd have to say Omar wins the Blue Ribbon for being an Attention Whore.  Has she actually done any work besides working her mouth.  Frankly, as a Trump Fan, I hope she keeps yapping.  Traditional-minded Democrats are doing the WalkAway.
@Harlan Many people, including Geraldo Rivera on Fox this morning, asked why did they have to make such a show of arresting Stone?  He was not "on the run."  FBI could have asked him to come down to them to turn himself in voluntarily. It's not only a "witch hunt" but a 5-Star Side Show.
@RealJamesWoods Probably saves a bunch not flying commercial:  	https://t.co/wHovda5oDV
@WegeSusanne @lyrnncarter05 @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer In the 1970s I lived in England.  I'm from here SF Bay Area (Novato).  Worked for a man who made replicated "antique" instruments. Once a month, I made deliveries to Saint-Denis (Paris suburb). You couldn't pay me enough to go there now: 	https://t.co/rmYdyy04fM
@Flyinjunkie2 @TheWave0079 @PodcastOne @IngrahamAngle @VDHanson @SpeakerPelosi Just heard on Fox (ingraham Angle) that today Chuck Schumer was responsible for BLOCKING EMERGENCY PAYMENTS TO FURLOUGHED WORKERS.  They talk and what do they say?  "This is Trump's fault.  Only Trump is to blame." NO, CHUCK.  IT'S YOU &amp; NANCY and we all know it.
@realDonaldTrump That's one of the reasons I watch Fox for my TV news and editorial programming.  Our economy is going gangbusters.  Thank you, Mr. President.  You're doing a great job!
@StarvinLarry @harjo111 What is going on the UK and EU is hardly manufactured.  Residents there, it seems, have simply surrendered:	https://t.co/5LAf1ROQca

@NottaLemming @HLAurora63 Nancy Pelosi -- among San Franciscans from the 1960s and before  -- is considered a carpetbagger from Baltimore.  He husband Paul Pelosi is a San Franciscan.  You ever notice how Nancy NEVER reminisces about those days in "good old Baltimore"? Her Dad was he mayor at one time.
@realDonaldTrump All good thoughts to you and Melania.  The blame for the shutdown belongs to the Democrats.  Hats off to you, Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnell for being even-keeled and ready to negotiate.  Hope it happens soon.
@ChrisRowland9 @lilbulli1031 People who make such proclamations are usually unemployed and unemployable. Funny how they always migrate to Christian countries as "asylum seekers."  They've done the same thing in the UK, EU, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, now USA.  Are we mugs or what?
@WegeSusanne @lyrnncarter05 @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer President Trump put the brakes on Pelsosi's junket where the first stop would have been Brussels? Here's a snapshot from YT on what one bit of Brussels looks like.  Kind of like San Francisco because NO WALLS: 	https://t.co/sIl0ijA434
@HLAurora63 @cs00582scs "Occasional lucid interval" is what I heard from an interviewee on Fox the other day.  He was describing what Speaker Pelosi has occasionally.  (That's medical terminology used for patients who have suffered a concussion or who are SENILE.
@nancy_hamm1 Not a religious person. Do not attend church regularly. Hit and miss attendee.  With President Trump in office makes me believe that God did play a hand in having Trump there instead of "Pay for Play" Hillary.  This country is too much of a miracle to be sold down the river.
@lyrnncarter05 @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer I think every American taxpayer should see this copy of the Speaker's in-flight bar bill.  So that in addition to the $40 million SF mansion and $10 million Napa spread, we can see where our tax dollars are being wasted.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Yes, Sen. Graham. Thankfully what American voters will remember is Speaker Pelosi's HATRED for President Trump along with the chaos and pain (800,000 Fed Employees) she created. Nancy's lunacy will be what drives voters to the polls for Trump in 2020. He's doing an excellent job.
@lyrnncarter05 @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer Nancy will drink her way (along with buddy Chuck) to impeachment:  https://t.co/wHovda5oDV
@MatthewJshow @marklevinshow Yes.  And he's left Pelosi squirming and worrying about what he's up to and what he'll do next. In the meantime, the American voters are seeing Nancy &amp; Chuck as the REAL ENEMIES.  So far C&amp;S have made all the wrong moves.
@Kam12283 @marklevinshow Agreed.  Nancy's motor is running on pure hatred.  Backfire is due.  Let us pray.
@ChatByCC @DD93778941 @realDonaldTrump I agree.  POTUS does not drink.  Can't say the same about the Speaker:	https://t.co/wHovda5oDV
@Lowcountry1Girl @SpeakerPelosi America knows who to blame for the shutdown.  Good old frequent-flyer Pelosi.  https://t.co/wHovda5oDV
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Thank you, Senator.  It is so reassuring to know you're there.  Voters, even here in the Bay Area are wondering what Nancy Pelosi's REAL motives are behind not meeting with the President.  You and Sen. McConnell and President Trump are the reasons I'm able to sleep at night.

@D1v5C @alley167 @KirstenPowers @washingtonpost "Approval Ratings." Before , during, and after the 2016 election Approval Ratings were way off base.  I think MSM'S cover story was the Russia Hoax. 2018 "Poll Numbers" about President Trump's approval rating and percentage of Americans who want and don't want the wall are off.
@ChuckCallesto I chose this YT clip to show what's happening in the UK (Luton, England) to show what happens when there is NO WALL.  Muslims now comprise over 40% of the population of Luton.  These are similar numbers to what has happened in Dearborn, MI USA Trump is right!
@TrumpPence45 @seeseerider @SpeakerPelosi Nancy?  It's hyphenated: OUT-TO-LUNCH!  BTW, the other thing that is out-to-lunch are your approval ratings. I and my fellow senior citizen friends all have relatives in England.  NO WALLS =&gt; FREELOADERS ANONYMOUS (and they are anonymous). BUILD THE WALL! Respect from. Novato, CA
@marklevinshow @DICEY63 Imperious to the point of being, what's the term?  "Not all there"?  Nancy is not thinking of the country or of her party. She's had 2 chances (and more) to sit down and negotiate with POTUS like a grown-up.  Now she's just acting like a spoiled brat who wants her Maypo.
@seanhannity DACA Dreamers have been fed up with Nancy for a long time.  More cracks:  https://t.co/4ZSgiNCE1a
@TheSharpEdge1 Nancy's been handed the winning hand for 2020 for her party -- TWICE.  But, she's screwed it up X 2. Security was not lacking for the SOTU. If she and Schumer had negotiated for the good of our country, Nancy would have looked like a true Power Player. Now, she's just scrambling.
@VanidaPeters @kbrunorunner Great composure, care and equanimity.  Very intelligent, thoughtful young man.  You'll go far, Nick Sandmann.
@TMURPH88 @MissyJo79 Single Term.
@realDonaldTrump Prediction:  You will go down in history as the POTUS with the  highest Nielsen Ratings for the State of the Union Message.  And, I predict your message will be the only SOTU in history worth listening to.  Thank you, Mr. President, for standing fast.
@dbongino @realDonaldTrump I'm a Eurasian female (65) born in Japan, raised in San Francisco &amp;  now live in Novato, CA My approval rating for President Trump, especially in light of his uncowed steadfastness he's demonstrated these past 2 years leaves me speechless."Ganbatte" Mr. President! DO NOT CAVE .
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch @SpeakerPelosi From 2010 Business Insider, Pelosi's In-Flight Refreshment Tab:	https://t.co/wHovda5oDV
@immigrant_legal @lynngermaine Not only did POTUS do that, but he takes only ONE DOLLAR for his salary. The rest goes to other departments of our government. I've been trying to figure out why all the hatred.These people hated seeing Hillary lose. Crackpots. Our country would have been doomed if she'd made it.
@realDonaldTrump  Look forward to hearing your State of the Union Message.  Great economic gains. Thank you so much for guiding our country forward and in the right direction  This senior citizen is headed back to work in 3 months.  NO CAVE, PLEASE!  MAGA!  Thank you very much.
@JoeCavaliere1 Yes, it is.  I don't think all these Swamp Rats like Pelosi and Schumer can bear the thought of Donald Trump even existing.  POTUS can't be bought or bullied.  He doesn't drink or smoke and stays in his office when there's work to do.  That is all so UNLIKE Pelosi &amp; Schumer.
@JacobAWohl Thanks for catching that.  It does make a difference.  And after her "screen test" at the Kavanaugh hearings I'm completely relieved.
@JohnCon35209137 @JacobAWohl @TheGreatFeather Thanks for reminding me about one of the BIG reasons I did NOT VOTE for Hillary.  Not just her wacko answer, but thinking about those 4 Americans who died in Benghazi because Hillary couldn't be bothered to do her jon.
@JoeCavaliere1  MSM should ask naturalized US citizens who got in line, obeyed the law &amp; became legal?  They never ask them: How do you feel about migrants who bum-rush the border and expect not only to be let in but welfare  benefits to boot.  MSM only wants to demonize Trump.
@ABC I'm half-white &amp; always puzzled about white guilt or whatever makes Bernie Sanders (white) call Trump (white)  a racist.  You mean, Bernie, that he wants people from Mexico &amp; Honduras to enter our country legally, be skilled &amp; not take welfare?  Racist?  Well, then I am a racist.
@Cali_Tracii @gopoundsand1234 @realDonaldTrump The sight of Elizabeth Warren still trying to rally a crowd -- after her Native American ancestry claims have been debunked -- makes me believe there should periodic psychiatric checks for EVERYONE in Congress.
@RichardTBurnett Nancy did it the first time she was Speaker.  USAF became known as the Pelosi Family &amp; Friends Airlines.
@RealMattCouch Is this another case of another "has been" -- i.e., Rosie O'Donnell, Kathy Griffin, Bette Midler, Johnny Depp, Robert De Niro, et. al. -- capitalizing on Trump Hatred for another 15 minutes of fame?  Just a few minutes more?

@Providence1783 @GrizzMaestro Couldn't agree with you more. President Trump recognizes it, too. Pelosi off to Belgium and then a photo-op in Afghanistan?  When does the Speaker of the House get that involved?  And how does a Speaker end up with a $40 million SF mansion and a Napa vineyard estate? "Sinister."
@DonaldJTrumpJr Bravo! Saw you on Ingraham. 5-Stars! My take, as a 65 YO former Dem is:  misogynist, xenophobe, racist, anti-LGBT.  Proof, please.  If MSM had any recordings or footage backing these accusations, they'd be playing them 24/7. God bless you. You're a 5-Star Son!
@GrizzMaestro Liberals? I'm 65 &amp; can remember a time when people respected others &amp; their opinions. Dems nowadays are crackpots like the woman who went squirrely seeing a MAGA hat on a plane on the guy in the seat next to her. Crew kicked her off.  Wish we could kick ALL DEMS off the planet!
@realDonaldTrump Thank you for standing fast. Also, thank you for taking away Nancy Pelosi's USAF Fly-for-Free privileges for her and her family.  She may get the "vapors" flying with the hoi-polloi.I notice your family does it all the time. Everyone else in the USA notices, too.
@ChuckCallesto Maxine needs her meds.
@ScottPresler Kamala is just living up too her reputation for being INSENSITIVE, CLASSLESS AND OBVIOUS.  Pure show-biz.

@RoryGilligan1 @Carver926 Her own family's "reticence"?  From the Washington Post Sept 2018:	https://t.co/LIXWbYY4uI
@RoryGilligan1 @Carver926 Cringe-worthy woman.  It's been pointed out -- but not publicized enough -- that Ford's family (blood relatives) kept their distance from Dr. Ford during the proceedings.  Her own FATHER wanted as little to do with her as possible.  A couple of her in-laws came through, though.
@FLOTUS @WhiteHouse Melania, you are wonderful!  Just the best.  Hope these next two years are great and that you're fully able to see and understand how many fans and admirers you have.  God bless you and the family.
@RoryGilligan1 @Carver926 Check out articles re Dr. Ford's GoFundMe account.  Hope she's able to sleep at night.  Or, maybe not.
@MaryMcC35520932 @DICEY63 @MariaBartiromo @foxandfriends @FoxNews @SundayFutures @SenJohnHoeven @RepRatcliffe @RepDebDingell @CongressmanJVD @ByronYork @FreemanWSJ Me, too.  Rep. Dingell.  Dingbat was more like it.  Maria's questions were DIRECT and Dingell went around the block 10 times before she gave any kind of answer which was nothing but noise.  I think Dingell held back afraid of what Mommy (Pelosi) might say. Dems are a sorry bunch.
@realDonaldTrump Remember, President Trump, that the great State of Arkansas voted for you big time in 2016!  You took 60% of its votes. Hillary Clinton? Only 30%  Now, wasn't she FIRST LADY OF ARKANSAS for 12 years?  Arkansans didn't like her much then, either.  MAGA!!! GOD BLESS YOU, MR. TRUMP.
@HLAurora63 This is what should be HEADLINE NEWS.  MAKES ME HOLD MY STOMACH. Nancy Pelosi is behind it?  Traitor.
@realDonaldTrump American Voters -- right and left -- are watching you do your job and watching Nancy NOT do her job. Grew up in the streets of San Francisco in the 1950s-1960s. I'm only 25 miles away now and won't go near it except for SF Giants Opening Day.  Otherwise, it's only a memory. MAGA!
@realDonaldTrump This is just an impression from a senior citizen (me) in the North Bay -- Novato, CA -- who hangs with other seniors who are watching the DC action or in Nancy's case, non-action.  You are brilliant, Mr. President.  Stand your ground.  We SEE what you're doing.
@ChuckCallesto And well they should.  Nancy's birdbrain Tweet should be enough to convince anybody that she is not thinking of the American people and those 800,000 workers going without paychecks.  Nancy and Chuck are just trying to destroy President Trump, but it's all BACKFIRING ON THEM.
@realDonaldTrump Excellent address.  Good luck.  We're all behind you.  MAGA!!!
@Serremmy @RobinNees Strange how the politicians like Maxine who have hit the jackpot$$$ with their PUBLIC service jobs are the ones who really, really hate Trump and want him IMPEACHED.
@dbongino @JoeBlazek3 Love whoever said on Cavuto this morning re Pelosi, "She has an occasional lucid Interval."  In the 1980s I was a medical typist and typed many a POT (Plan of Treatment) for many a doctor about a senior citizen with dementia.  Hearing that brought back memories and made me LOL.
@BigBrotherGOD1 @phillyeaglesfa1 @realDonaldTrump Wouldn't trust Rashida as far as I could throw her.  She can't even take ownership of her own words.  Hope you, Rashida, have a very "authentic" single term in office.
@CamiP934 I agree all-around.  Dems have a habit of wanting to be heard, but, as you point out, they expose themselves. They always "expose" themselves as non-thinkers. That Kavanaugh debacle would never have happened if they were truly smart. Those 2 Midwest dingbats must be watched.
@JackRabbit76 @BigBrotherGOD1 @BlueSea1964 @realDonaldTrump Omar and Tlaib are warning signs to the rest of our country.  It's a good thing they can't keep their mouths shut.
@realDonaldTrump @BondMekisha Yes, Mr. President. Watched Fox this morning and they mentioned the "feeding frenzy" may be over.  I hope that In the next 2 years all American voters will come to their senses.  Can't wait to hear your address today.  Thank you so much for being a BIG BREATH OF FRESH HONEST AIR!
@barmore27 @JimKuther @gatewaypundit Who was that on Cavuto yesterday who said that Nancy has "an occasional lucid interval"?  I wish I had written his name down.  "Electronic Dogs" obviously wasn't one of Nancy's "intervals."
#robertmueller Thank you.  Judy Hicks, Novato, California
@realDonaldTrump The worst I thought of Robert Mueller is that he must be making "busy work" for himself with the Russia Probe.  Love what he did today -- disavowing and debunking BuzzFeed and proving your point about FAKE NEWS. Looking forward to hearing you tomorrow.  MAGA!!!
@Caliicoder3 @averagerepub @SpeakerPelosi Omar's feelings about Jews are no secret. Is Omar living the American Dream of moving here from Somalia and being able to shoot off her mouth with no repercussions? Yikes.  She must be a lousy card player.  She not only tips her hand but she broadcasts it all over the Internet.
@seanhannity Nice to know that Nancy remains as dirty as ever.  Thank you for sharing, Sean.
@SteveGuest Instead of a trip to Brussels, maybe Nancy &amp; Chuck should try a trip to the affected wall-free patch of our southern border?

@MarkDice @fondue_chub Thankfully, the American voters are on to Pelosi.  Nancy, who won't meet with Angel Moms and Dads, is only preoccupied with NOT DOING HER JOB and trying to blame all the ills of our country on President Trump.  No, Speaker Pelosi.  It is you.
@realDonaldTrump Your argument, Mr. President, is more compelling. You stayed in your office waiting for Dems to come and bargain with you. Dems were ready to flee. All Dems seem to know is how to say "NO!"  American voters are watching and so is the world.  STAND YOUR -- OUR -- GROUND!  MAGA!
@ChuckyD2 @LoriinUtah @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi "Corrupt" is the word.  $40 million SF mansion and vineyard estate in Napa. Even with Paul Pelosi for a husband, that's a bit much.  Hope Nancy gets to work soon and starts earning the salary she's still collecting while NOT doing her job and the WORLD WATCHES HER "LAX"-NESS.

@LoriinUtah @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi Yours deserves to be #1.  Imagine 2 years of nothing but I HATE TRUMP from Speaker Pelosi and Chuck Schumer.  Both of them are a wastes of space.
@LoriinUtah @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS You mean Nancy"s been TRUMPED?
@LoriinUtah @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi Only two solutions:  (1) Stay home. (2) Fly commercial.
@seanhannity Just what has the American Public seen from Nancy Pelosi since the 2016 election?  ONLY that Nancy is totally reoccupied with demonstrating in every way that she HATES him.  He is the President, Nancy.  Get over it.  Go fly commercial.
@marklutchman Does Nancy ever fly commercial?  When she was Speaker the first time the USAF was better known as the Pelosi Family &amp; Friends Airline.
@POTUS Thank you, President Trump for suggesting to Speaker Pelosi that she should fly commercial.  After all, it's the United States Air Force and not the Pelosi Family &amp; Friends Airline:  https://t.co/wHovda5oDV

Keep an eye on England and the rest of the United Kingdom. No borders and no Travel Ban.  Brexit means control back to the people -- not newly-arrived squatters and freeloaders.  Oops.  I mean "asylum seekers."
@DiamondandSilk Good question, D&amp;S.  Nancy's lies aren't supposed to matter? Security for the SOTU.  Nancy used that as an excuse for a delay. Kirstjen Nielsen said, in so many words, BALONEY.  Secret Service and Homeland Security have the speech more than covered.  Sit down and shut up, Nancy.
@marklutchman I turned Libertarian in 2016 and voted Libertarian in the election.  Hillary was just too repellent. Now that President Trump has proven that he can't be bullied, can't be bought and loves our country, YES, I will votes for Donald Trump in 2020.
@POTUS Just saw Stave Scalise on Laura Ingraham on Fox.  Excellent idea from Steve:  Do the State of the Union Address from the Southern Border (Texas).  Makes sense.  You're unconventional and these are very unconventional times.  Thank you for doing your job for our country.
@RealJamesWoods @mwam1993 Things do have a way of turning around.  Nancy lied about the need for security at the SOTU Address.  Chuck Schumer delivered a heavily unfavorable recounting of a meeting with AG candidate, William Barr.  I find neither one of these Dems credible.  I'm not alone, thank God.
@realDonaldTrump Thank you for being out in the open with what you do -- e.g., remaining at your desk and doing your job -- and not falsely agitating by pretending security risks so that you can't do your job.  Whatever you decide, I'm with you.  Good luck, Mr. President.
@marklevinshow You're right, but too kind. When Nancy told us she believes her clout is equal or surpasses that of POTUS let we, the people, know her bolts could use tightening. Today, when she LIED re the need for security at the SOTU Address told me she also needs Rx and Tx -- lots of both.
@seanhannity Another sign of the Dems getting desperate in light of President Trump's successes and ever-gaining popularity.  I do not trust polls, especially the ones that discount or discredit Republicans and POTUS.  I'm still a Libertarian but Dems strike me as cagey and desperate.
@patni1111 🎵🎶Thank you🎵🎶. Love your bio. I'm 1st Gen American. My late Mom was from Japan. Loved America. Would have loved Trump. Loves his country &amp; fellow Americans. No gamester &amp; trickster like Schumer &amp; Pelosi who block all of Trump's good moves. BUILD THE WALL!
@lilibellmia @patni1111 @SpeakerPelosi I believe POTUS will be the winner.  Unless you're deaf-dumb-and-blind and don't play a mean pinball, you are hearing daily who's behind the blockage and the delays.  Chuck Schumer and NANCY PELOSI.  BOTH AVOWED TRUMP HATERS.  Nancy more than Chuck. Good luck, POTUS.
@freedom_moates @CaryNovak DORK Don Lemon probably doesn't even need those specs. Probably thinks they make him look intellectual. I support President Trump. Does that make me a racist?  I'm half Japanese and half American and I'm 65.  In my life I've always given people the benefit of the doubt, Pin Head!
@charliekirk11 @winegirl73 This is CNN:	https://t.co/OPYFaSo8SL
@seanhannity @patni1111 This is Nancy Pelosi from the last SOTU.  Attentive, respectful listener?  	https://t.co/OPYFaSo8SL
@bigredwavenow @karliesl @realDonaldTrump Check out YouTube for Nancy's performance at Trump's last SOTU.  Rolling her eyes and dragging her tongue across her teeth.  Childish brattiness.  That's our Nancy!

This YouTube clip hosted by Tom Trento was made by a Right Wing watchdog group, i shows you where we're headed with no borders."Paris....Lost?" 	https://t.co/8j8bqu8p4Z
@BreitbartNews Nancy &amp; Chuck.  Two avowed enemies of the American People.  Always walking side by side.  Charming.
@GovMikeHuckabee Thanks for sharing, Governor Huckabee.  I only have one word in response:  "GULP!"
@realDonaldTrump Voters like me know it's the Dems who are the BRICKWALL and aren't negotiating at all BECAUSE IT'S YOU who wants the wall.  Why not go with Sen. Graham's suggestion and open the govt up temporarily?  Get people paid. You will come out ahead. Then, there's that State of Emergency.
@PatriotRocker69 @lilibellmia @SpeakerPelosi It will be Angel Moms and Dads and their families, among others, who will see President Trump gets a 2nd term.  Also American tourists who venture to places in the EU and UK that have NO borders.  No BORDERS is an eye opener.
@BrendaNord5 @gailsline @realDonaldTrump I have to agree. Who goes to the polls?  People who are settled. If you own your own home and install Ring so you can see who's standing on your porch and want in. MIGRANTS?  They have nothing to lose and no right to be there.  Best course? Trump in 2020 AND A WALL!
@JohnCornyn Excellent speech this morning. Thank you so much from a California Voter.
@realDonaldTrump Excellent choice of William Barr for AG.  In spite of K. Harris and C. Booker tuning the questioning into yet another 2020 Campaign Op, the American Public saw Barr in his very best light.  Thank you, Mr. President for selecting him.
@Crunk5454 @TrumpTruthTalk Chuck and Nancy are creating their own BACKLASH as Hillary Clinton did in 2016.  Thank goodness.
@ChrisBragdon @mymynags @skb_sara @realTTCU @fgra @Jhwrr @Jetsta812 @Imfornd @kimholy1 @BearOlaf @JeffreyFrye @renee_red2 @Lexa_Merica @RedWingGrips @MillieBonham @Johnadonis9 @Aaroninthe208 @3rdgradeinburbs @leftovergravy @DaveSchreiber3 "She'll cut off your head and you won't even know you're bleeding" is how the 48 year old Alexandra Pelosi PUBLICLY characterizes Mom. Offspring payback? A case of Daughter Dearest?
@marklutchman She's fearful and pretentious.Nancy's originally from Baltimore.  Maybe she's embarrassed by that. Dem trait. More than one person I know has reported to jury duty the same day as fellow Marin-ite Barbara Boxer.  Consensus: Icy, no eye contact.  Neither Dem is a "People Person."
@LoDuv_ @DanCovfefe1 @SpeakerPelosi And here I thought Nancy Pelosi would welcome them  with open arms, hugs and kisses all around?  Life's a mystery.  Maybe she prefers they park themselves in the walled courtyard of her $40 million San Francisco mansion.  You never know.
@seanhannity I have the Incredulity Gene. Comes with age. You sense liars. Some lie for the sake of PC. Drives me nuts about Dems. They can't help themselves. They lie for the sake of scoring political points. Don't sense that with Trump.  He's not a phony and he stays home and does his job.
@RealLLoomer Germany, Sweden and Italy have started blocking, deporting AND DENYING WELFARE to newly arrived "ASYLUM SEEKERS."  In other words, why not try Bahrain, Qatar and Saudi Arabia for a free handout?
@seanhannity Good point, Sean!
@NancyJKoch @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @POTUS These "We HATE TRUMP &amp; DAMN THE WALL" tricksters want Trump &amp; the Wall to fail. Then, they can turn around and say in 2020, "Look, he didn't keep his promises." S&amp;P,  as my old pub buddy, Malcolm, used to say, "are a horrible waste of perfectly good sperm."  BUILD THE WALL! MAGA!
@LadyRedWave @BreitbartNews Thank you and bless you, Brigitte Gabriel.
@KAG4All @JohnnyB371 @Trump454545 @starcrosswolf @LVNancy @ROCKONOHIO @SweetKat111 @jojoh888 @SandraTXAS @pinkk9lover Was at a San Rafael (CA) Safeway. A woman from Zimbabwe was trying to use her EBT (Food Stamps) Card for paper towels. In the ruckus she raised after being declined, we found our where she was from and that she had 5 children who needed PT for "their cleanliness."  VETS FIRST!
@charliekirk11 @MAGAGirl10 All Charter Members of the SORE LOSER CLUB.  Something tells me -- just a LOL's hunch -- that Hillary did some Wheeling &amp; Dealing prior to the election of 2016. These bone-heads missed out on undelivered deals because Trump won.  They're not about to "let it go." BUILD THE WALL!
@DoingRight1 @TakeAStandLeav1 Aren't they all pretty much in the "Has Been" spectrum of the Hollywood hierarchy?  Who's next?  KoKo the Clown popping out of the inkwell?
@realDonaldTrump Thank you, President Trump for staying in Washington, DC and DOING YOUR JOB!  Even Dems will take notice once that photo of Bob Menendez on the beach in Puerto Rico gets around. I'm at a point where I think even the polls are FAKE.  Your approval rating is better than ever. MAGA!
@Mj2Keane @KimberlyMrsRR1 @SenSchumer Schumer &amp; Pelosi are the ONLY TWO declaring Trump Tantrums.  All I see now is the President in the White House holding down the fort and waiting to deal and Dick &amp; Jane, I mean, Dick &amp; Nancy going down to Puerto Rico to see Hamilton, my money is on NO TANTRUMS, just politicking.
@stripedbanana3 @PaulieD55 I'm a minority female (65 year old Eurasian). In my life when I hear someone shout "racist," "fascist," and "Nazi" it's because they have no argument.  They, like this Dem, just want to sound off because they hate Trump and lost Hillary Clinton. To them, I say "Grow up."
@BusyElves @realDonaldTrump You took the words right out of my mouth.I turned Libertarian after being a Dem for 40+ years because Hillary was too scary. Since then, Dems have ONLY shown their malignant, diabolical hatred for Trump. President Trump has shown me how much he loves his country. BUILD THE WALL!
@2runtherace @LiliaNovember @realDonaldTrump Ever since 2016, I've felt that God has had a hand not only in the election, but in showing the American public what opportunistic hypocrites Dems are.  This week has been an expository showcase for both sides with Trump coming out on top. Honest, bully-proof &amp; loves his country.
@baalter @Chris_A10_USA President Trump is not holding anyone hostage.He is In the White House ready to work. Nancy goes off to Hawaii for a $10,000 a night vacation and is now on her way to Puerto Rico to see Hamilton.Thanks, but no thanks, Nancy.  Your explanations and accusations are 24-carat crap.
@charliekirk11 Yes.
@bbusa617 John Kennedy (R-LA) his thoughts on Nancy Pelosi on Fox:  "Billy-goat brain, mockingbird mouth." Every time I see Pelosi on a Tweet, I hear Sen. Kennedy's words.  BUILD THE WALL.
@LauraButler6 @JahMekAWail @speelman_emmett @mitchellvii Thank you for reminding us.
@realDonaldTrump Thank you, Mr. President for not taking early weekends (or any weekends at all) and slipping away to Puerto Rico to see Hamilton. Thank you for speaking with Border Patrol Officers and Angel Moms and Dads. You're doing a great job --  a job YOU  take seriously
@marklutchman @workfromhome7T7 Hmm.  A strong black woman who doesn't live in the district she represents? That shows me someone is "scared" of someone.
@JohnCornyn @ArizonaKayte You are correct.  I believe in America and the "smarts" of American  voter who see that Nancy &amp; Chuck are behind this obstruction.  Nancy &amp; Chuck are noticing that we're noticing that it's THEM.  BUILD  THE WALL!!!
@KTHopkins Thank you Katie. We Americans have been shortchanged on news from the EU and UK which show the dangers of soft and no borders. Between now and 2020, these sad happenings will prove that WALLS can be useful.MSM on our side of the pond will withhold or under-report news like China.
@realDonaldTrump @CaliExit Pres. Trump I saw Hannity tonight with Angel Moms and Dads. They all raised their hands when asked if you'd spoken with them.  Thank you, Mr. President for being everything that Chuck And Nancy are not.  BUILD THE WALL, PLEASE!!!
@PoliticalIslam @mike_morbius Thank you, Dr. Warner. Brigitte Gabriel and you need to open our (USA) eyes about this threat. The UK and EU are already doomed. French law currently prohibits the collection of data based on race, ethnicity or religion. The same in England.  Meant to prohibit Anti-Muslim Speak.
@4YrsToday @MikeLee762 Lots of credibility. Many of us here in the US have relatives abroad -- UK and EU.  Did you know "French law currently prohibits the collection of data based on race, ethnicity or religion"? Same in England. I hope we don't end up PC'ing our country to death. BUILD THE WALL.
@CalebJHull @CaryNovak As the article points out in that Paris suburb alone "... the numbers continue to rise, as an estimated 80 migrants arrive in Paris every 24 hours — 550 a week." This could very easily happen at our southern border. Nancy &amp; Chuck should take a trip to Paris.
@ciripc @hecate5points @cnsnews It is so refreshing to hear Alveda.  Not swept up in Trump hatred thinking POTUS is trying to "purify" our country by limiting access to our country by brown people.  Alveda knows it's not color. Alveda knows: If you don't have the right to be here in the USA, KEEP OUT!
@CalebJHull @CaryNovak It is beyond ridiculous.  POTUS just doesn't want what's happening in Paris (Saint-Denis) to happen here.  300,000 illegals in a Paris suburb: https://t.co/GfuU4hDQVi
@Lowcountry1Girl For Schumer and, especially, Pelosi, this has been a HATE TRUMP campaign.  I'd like to think that this country, which has given the two of them so much, including multimillion net worth's would mean more.  Get to work and DO YOUR JOB! BUILD THE WALL!
@GovMikeHuckabee Good question.  President Trump is the only one taking this seriously.
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Didn't Pelosi and Schumer conspire to be part of the Fake News when they told the same story about POTUS  slamming his fist on the table and storming out of the room. I wish these Bobbsey Twins of Trump Haters would love their country more like POTUS and you, Governor Huckabee.
@realDonaldTrump Heard McAllen, TX citizens on Fox. They stand with you. I'm in Novato, CA and I stand with them.  Please don't cave in to the Dems.
@RealJamesWoods "It is better to remain silent and seem a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt."  I don't know who said it first.  Probably someone's mother.  Too bad Jim Acosta's mother didn't give him that piece of advice.
@realDonaldTrump Love your style.  You go McAllen, TX while the Dems get an early start for the weekend.  Thank you for being one of the hardest working Chief Executives this country has ever seen.
@RealJamesWoods @theocintric Or as Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) stated on Fox "billy-goat brain, mockingbird mouth."
@americawins49 Is that the young lass we all saw trying to climb the wall?
@Sekusa1 @nancy_hamm1 "Billy-goat brain, mockingbird mouth." While Sen. Kennedy (D-LA) was talking about Pelosi.  I think, after yesterday's Fric &amp; Frac Dems' response to the President's public address, I think the Kennedy's description applies to both of them.  They're a couple of cartoon characters.
@awlatlanta @ILMFOrg Chuck &amp; Nancy are the ones playing games.  The "We HATE Trump" Games.  We, the American Voter, see what you're doing.  We also see what C&amp;S are NOT doing.  Thank you, Mr. President, for loving our country and protecting us.
@ToscaAusten @DICEY63 Nancy Pelosi &amp; Chuck Schumer! These two senior citizens should grow  up.  Respect your country, flag and your President, please.  Your sore  loser schtick is old to fellow senior citizens like me who expect you to  do your jobs. Knock off the "I Hate Trump" BS and get to work.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Thank you, Mr. President.  Their hatred for you and their patronizing dismissal for the safety of Americans makes me wonder how they justify murders of Americans by illegals.  Nancy and Chuck are a strange duo.  God bless you, Mr. President and stand fast.
@DudaPhillis @Wblscott1 @realDonaldTrump What is the problem with Fric &amp; Frac?  Is it because President Trump is richer than the two of them put together?  I love this meme BTW.  American Gothic is lovely, but The Shining S&amp;P Twins capture the essence of the two Demon Demccrats.
@realDonaldTrump Can't be bought.  Can't be bullied.  Loves your country and the American people.  Stick to your guns. Mr. President.  The voters understand what you're doing, and more importantly, what they're not doing.
@LadyRedWave Welfare freeloaders from Somalia are what make Maine great?  Yeah, right.  Oops, I forgot.  They're "Asylum Seekers."  My bad.
@kimusastrong @ZibaLady1 It's called "White Flight" in the UK and EU.  We'll probably call it something nicer-sounding the way we refer to ILLEGAL ALIENS" as "Undocumented Migrants."
@seanhannity I can't believe they're that clueless.  For me, they simply HATE TRUMP and let our country and the safety of its people -- like you and me and like them -- be damned.
@grizzle_meister Thank you, Mark.  Thank you, GRIZZ
@phillyeaglesfa1 @sewwutnow (Left) Too much scotch.  (Right) Too much Botox.
@erik0015 BIAS. KCBS Radio in SF is my channel of choice.  It comes in the clearest and gives the time and temperature every ten minutes.  Traffic is always "iffy." Sports scores.  Without John Madden, I turn off my hearing.  News?  Heavily edited.  Sound bites from Lib politicians only.
@miss9afi Thank you, Ensaf haidar.  Stay on Twitter and voice your opinions that speak from experience and of your own life.  It will enlighten us all.  God bless you.
@McguireScotty @gailsline These days -- with everybody having a cellphone -- people who are inclined to go unhinged should know they are throwing their lives away when the throw a PUBLIC tantrum.  Or whatever the heck that was supposed to be.  Remember that book "The Primal Scream." Maybe she read it.
@charliekirk11 @NewMe73744179 No borders?  Try YouTube and Search "The Jungle at Calais"
@pamellalala @GovMikeHuckabee This one should be on the front page of USA Today!
@tony2glove @neontaster You have to admit they did it to themselves.
@Trump454545 @LbMoult Botox.
@Scavino45 @realDonaldTrump And notice how they never care to answer when asked about their walls?  Especially Nancy and her 15 foot wall around her $40 million mansion in San Francisco?
@gailsline @Lynnoftrumpland @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @SenSchumer @senatemajldr @GOPLeader Yes.
@winstonCovfefe @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer Brilliant!
@realDonaldTrump Thank you for your clear, direct, and DETAILED explanation of why we need a WALL.  The EU and UK are suffering for their lack of WALLS.  Thank you for loving our country and wanting to keep it and us safe.  God bless you!
@LindseyGrahamSC Always reassuring to hear you. Thank you for your words of clarification and calm. As an American who has relatives in England and has heard about the chaos caused by EU and UK soft borders (actually NO BORDERS) it is imperative we secure the USA.God bless you.
@USA_Bev @DICEY63 @FoxNews @marklevinshow @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I agree.  It should be repeated several times.
@MeadowgirlM Cherokee Nation is probably sick and tired of that beer swilling crackpot trying to claim she's related to them in any way.  Elizabeth, daughter of a Montgomery Ward salesman, knew how to exploit her made-up "heritage" in her educational &amp; professional life. Now, everyone knows
@carlmascari @MaryOsb36485285 @catturd2 BTW Does AOC still raise her rent money from a GoFundMe account?
@cajunhusker @BretBaier Fox does have 24/7 news-and-editorial programming.Don't live and breathe Fox, but they back opinion w/work experience (i.e., border officials who discuss Southern border). Prime Time MSM = non-stop insinuations on Trump's lack of ethics or a 60-minute Tom Steyer IMPEACH TRUMP PSA
@ArizonaKayte I call them the Trump Hate Tag Team.  The two of them HATE President Trump more than they love their -- OUR -- country.
@realDonaldTrump Looking forward to your address tonight.  Always enjoy a speaker who is clear and straightforward and HONEST.  Thank you for not being bullied and not being FOR SALE.  We see you for what you are. A man who loves his country and his fellow Americans.  THANK YOU1
@AwakenedAussie Fiona, you are so right.  The Left (including PBS) always wants to portray the citizens of those EU and UK countries who aren't happy with migrants as Ultra-Right, Nazis, Fascists, Racists. No.  They just want their countries back without ungrateful and criminal freeloaders.

They are residents CITIZENS of Sweden who were asked to be host to over 100,000 unvetted "refugees" from the Middle East and Africa.  Don't blame Swedes for being fed-up with the refugees' lousy behavior.
@tca1221_toni That makes too much sense.
@brandiismine Whoever said this predicted the Coming of Cory:  "It is better to remain silent and seem a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt."
@DeplorableTrump Strong.
@dbongino @winkiechance Why is, Dan, that the media seldom interviews legal aliens or naturalized citizens recently naturalized?  Love to hear what they have to say.
@Jenn198523 @awlatlanta Check out Dearborn, Michigan and Hamtramck in the same state.  Muslim population in some Michigan cities and towns is disproportionately large.
@LbMoult @gatewaypundit Saw them. Watched while Geraldo strained to make every syllable he spoke come out as politically correct as possible. Such a simple concept.  If you're here illegally you are breaking the law.  Go home.  Why does our government bend over backwards for people who break our laws?
@seanhannity Funny with all the accusations of Trump's homophobia, xenophobia, misogyny, and on and on, no one ever gives an example or has proof?  I contend that if proof did exist, CNN would play it or show it 24/7.  Trump is as innocent as Kavanaugh.  Both victims of "Trial By Gossip."

@DanCrenshawTX @Sunnyc4u Dan, thank you so much for your service. I hope your message sinks in where it's needed.  God bless you.
@PeterSweden7 Many of these migrants are freeloaders -- accepting welfare -- under the guise of being "asylum seeker." Many of them are Muslim who refuse to RESPECT their host country's traditions and laws &amp; native residents.  Very sad. Same thing in the UK and USA. Dearborn, MI for example.
@GOPWarLord @tladd58 @NevadaJack2 @wachinunow Best laugh I've had all week!Speaking of  Pelosi, I think her brain is showing its age. Speaking as a senior citizen I know one symptom is repeating yourself. Either her vocabulary is very limited or Nancy feels repeating the word "immoral" will sway us to her side. It does not.
@RealJamesWoods @Sunnyc4u Pres Trump has nothing to worry about in 2020.  Waters, Warren, Pelosi, Schumer -- dim bulbs.-- do their daily pop-ups like the moles in Whack-a-Mole wearing out their welcome. Unfounded accusations and pubescent insults and character attacks on POTUS are going nowhere.  MAGA!!!
@quentinking46 @pocono_mtn Brilliant!  Thank you, Sen. Cruz!!!
@bud_cann @nancy_hamm1 @SenSchumer Also January 29, 2010 Business Insider article by Vince Veneziani published with bar bill receipt for Nancy Pelosi (totaling just over $101,000) make these two the Bobbsey Twins of hypocrisy and vice.  Nancy was also traveling at taxpayer expense via USAF.
@dclark551 @harjo111 Business Insider (3 years ago) published Pelosi's "Bar Bill" from flying the friendly skies of the United States Air Force.  The total came to just over $101,000.  Bottoms up!
@AshleyW838 @gailsline @Nikita1838 @ladycali18 @MorningInUSA123 @CaliBeachGirl88 @Reblyn1963 @lngodwetrust1 @jeromeyee @JTrentkemp1 @mandoville @CoulsonLance These two know how to rally money for their causes -- themselves. I think what these two do is known by many as Performance Art.  Dare not call them phonies.  that would be racist.
@marklutchman Rashida certainly doesn't hide her feelings, does she?  Someone should interview her and ask her for "which specific impeachable crimes" is she becoming unhinged over.  (Don't give her time to study).
@DeplorableTrump Isn't this time for you to tell Dems "Put up or shut up"?  Always INSINUATING, NEVER PROVING:  that you are a liar, misogynist, racist, homophoBE, etc. If there was proof, tHey'd play it 24/7 on CNN, no?  Thank you for loving out country.  BUILD THE WALL, PLEASE.
@JPAellen @charleyweems64 Nancy and Chuck are solely to blame.The conceit and vanity of the two of them were responsible for the death of Newman, CA Police Cpl Ronil Singh, a naturalized US citizen from Fiji. Officer Singh got in line, waited his turn &amp; was living his dream as a police officer.He was 33.
@realDonaldTrump @AppSame Don't understand your WALL OPPONENTS. Luton, England is now 24.6% Muslim due to soft or no borders. This is a town of 203,201 is now 1/4 Muslim.  Changes happened in last 20 years. We have Dearborn, MI that's now 40% Muslim.   Both towns Both swift pop changes. BUILD THE WALL!
@Justice4Pierce @eemd48 Deepest sympathy to you and your family.
@winstonCovfefe Dearborn and Hamtramk, Michigan Muslim population is about 40%. This is also the reason why President Trump has the Travel Ban and wants to end Chain Migration.  Want more Rashida Tlalb BS? Stop letting them in and voting the in.
@LinThorn1 Dropped the Dems in 2016 and turned Libertarian. The thought that Hillary could be trusted and was a reflection of MY VALUES turned my stomach. I'm 65.  I think many Dem seniors will have similar changes of heart. Pelosi, Ocasio-Cortez, Schumer -- the best of Dems? BYE-BYE!
@wvufanagent99a @Don_Vito_08 @CB618444 @G1rly_Tattooed @magagary687 @PatrioticVa @Lady_Vi_2U @ImabitcSumtimes @KatTheHammer1 @Maggieb1B @BeckysAcosta @paulajarvis69 Rashida will be the cause of backfire on the Dems.Damaging backfire they're causing themselves.Rashida, Nancy, Chuck, Alexandria, Elizabeth, Maxine, et. al. are all  lessons on how to be your own worst enemy. Any one of you ever  consider sealing your lips before your ship sinks?
@speakrofhouse @Sweet_PeaBelle Every time she opens her mouth with any lame excuse to show how much she hates President Trump (and the American people who elected him), I imagine Nancy wearing one of those t-shirts that say:  "In My Defense I Was Left Unsupervised."
@BreitbartNews Gosh, they look like twins!
@seanhannity Pelosi's hate for Trump knows no bounds. Trouble is it overwhelms any love for our country.  Nancy is a disaster, but POTUS may play the right hand in declaring a State of Emergency. If we don't want to end up like Germany, France,  Sweden, England etc. we must BUILD THAT WALL.
@LiliaNovember @baalter @KKpower7 @HookedOnHopium @Redtowel4 @BreitbartNews At least she's being conspicuous. It's like tipping your hand in a card game.  She can't win because everyone knows she's coming.  What a mouth!
@Schmeltz79 @peacethruhope Ask her daughter:   "She'll cut your head off and you won't even know you're bleeding."  		Lovely family. So quaint.
@brideofJC @DanCovfefe1 @bgood12345 @realDonaldTrump I always think of that.  Of what might have been with his opponent.  God had a hand in Donald Trump's election. I have no doubt.
@1acemadsen1 Truer words were never spoken.
@marklutchman @Jane_the_Deplor Beautifully said.
@elainetwing1 On the other hand, the grief that she's causing President Trump is awakening people to the vain, twisted way Nancy views her country and her fellow Americans.  Courtesy of Twitter we're treated to the stalemate she's caused for no other reason than she hates Trump with a passion.
@TrumpWillWinnn @AppSame @TrumpMyPres @realDonaldTrump @Lrihendry @LeahR77 @jjauthor @IngrahamAngle @EmfingerSScout @mjgranger1 @gypsyjoo @ChatByCC $40 million PELOSI mansion in San Francisco -- gated, walled with 24/7 armed security -- YUP!
@winstonCovfefe So these are the "Faces of Islam"?
@seanhannity At the State of the Union Message, Nancy squirmed in her seat, rolled her eyes and dragged her tongue across her teeth -- a picture of childish fussiness and disgust. 2nd in line after VP to the Presidency of the United States? As the movie quote goes: "Be afraid. Be very afraid"
@SecNielsen I applaud your attempts to get the Dems to listen and understand what ICE and border security faces daily. Constant interruptions and blocking  by Pelosi &amp; Schumer.? These two &amp; their calculated, out-of-control hatred of POTUS is not fooling American voters. Thank you, Kirstjen!
@johnwoolf @ZibaLady1 While President Trump stayed in the Oval Office, Nancy Pelosi went to Hawaii at a $10,000 per night resort.  Voters should remember that when they go to the polls in 2020.  MAGA!!!!!
@DTrumpPoll @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Nancy Pelosi is the ONLY roadblock to the WALL.  Schumer is just as bad but doesn't carry the same clout.  Nancy is the one who hates Trump and our country and our people.
@realDonaldTrump Thank you, President Trump.  Thank you for your equanimity and never being a PC phony.  Thank you for loving our country and your fellow Americans.  We know why you want that WALL.  So do ICE agents and people who work on the border.  My in-laws in England "get it."  Great job!
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump You certainly can't accuse Rashida Tlaib of hiding her feelings.  She's tipped her hand "big time." Wonder what's next?
@seahippy29 @crimsonfaith88 @realDonaldTrump @DNC @GOP @USBPChief Why are Dems so averse to recognizing  what is happening in England.  Luton has been pretty much taken over by Muslims from Syria.  Most are on welfare and make it clear they're there for benefits and have no intention of obeying laws.  No borders.They just came in and settled.
@FlipItRed Good question.Tell that to the people of the UK and EU hit hard by illegal aliens marching in and making themselves at home. These houseguests from hell never encountered a WALL. If Pelosi travels to the EU in 2019 -- especially France -- she might change her mind about OUR WALL.
@realDonaldTrump @crimsonfaith88 Stay strong &amp; steadfast. Heard how the meeting went with constant interruptions from Chuck and Nancy. They hate you more than they love our country.  The 2020 election will show them how we feel about their games. The American people know you want to protect us.  God bless you.
@1bigbeer @NancyPelosi Another wasted day at the WH thanks to the Trump Hate Tag Team. Pretty embarrassing for those two old coots -- Schumer and Pelosi -- simply because they hate our President. I have a feeling that life, because of their ugly conceits, will come back and BITE THEM!  Trump in 2020!
@TheBreckWorsham Expository, ain't it?  Or maybe it's a case of  Daughter Dearest?
@Thomas1774Paine @humanizzimo1 Thank you, Alice Cooper. your strong appreciation of Glen Campbell, his talent and your words of friendship and admiration for him made me appreciate you even more highly."Abuse of Power" is a perfect description of all the current celebrity Trump "abuse." AC, you're 100% right.
@The_Trump_Train Elizabeth Warren is the creme de la creme of Democrats?  Down the hatch.
@charliekirk11 @SheepdogSecurit Won't begrudge show biz &amp; IT notables  They did it without sucking off the taxpayer teat.  Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters, Chuck Schumer, Elizabeth Warren &amp; Feinstein however, GAMED THE SYSTEM. $40 million SF mansion mansion above &amp; beyond. It's IMMORAL:
@LaylaAlisha11 @Beachbabe661 And, don't forget the ARMED SECURITY PATROLS.   "IMMORAL"?
@crusaderkeif @MichaelSowerby6 In 2015 RAF Sgt Mark Prendeville in uniform was removed from a Royal Hospital waiting room after being injured on a training exercise because his uniform might "give offense." Mark had served in Afghanistan and Bosnia.  This great patriot serves his country and he's hidden away?
@Carterdsc Why does MSM never interview naturalized US citizens who got in line and obeyed the law?  Like my late Mom from Japan.  Jackie Speier?  Nancy Pelosi? They don't have anything valid to say.  Plenty of LEGALS would love to speak to America. MSM, Fox where are you and your mikes?
@PinkBelgium @grizzlemeister @realDonaldTrump Just caught the current retrospective "Scandalous" on Fox.  Bill and Hillary were quite the couple -- singularly and as a set.  Nice distraction from Mueller and his Probe.  Happy New Year!
@ChuckCallesto Excellent point.  My nephew-in-law manages a pub in Liverpool, England.  The regulars have already started a pool on Trump's win in 2020.  The majority already say POTUS is a shoo-in.
@KatTheHammer1 @JDjwhite54 We should all be praying for General Flynn.  God bless him.  Thank you and God bless you, Alan Dershowitz.
@sjcloobeck President Trump has nothing to worry about. Elizabeth Warren is the best Dems can come up with?  What's the Cherokee word for "surreal"?
@RagingGayCons Linda had the first of her 3 children when she was 17.  Welfare supported them throughout their childhoods.  Then, Linda found her calling and her hijab.  Best opinion of Linda Sarsour can be found with the words of Brigitte Gabriel (author of Rise) who know whereof she speaks.
@LaylaAlisha11 @kvmidd85 The hatred that Pelosi and Schumer have for President Trump is, as you point out Layla, felonious.  They hate him more than they love their country or their fellow citizen.  The two of them are sick and are a disgrace to the US.  God bless you, Layla.
@PressSec You're doing a great job!  I have nothing but admiration for your equanimity, control and graciousness in a trying arena. Have a beautiful 2019!  You have admirers everywhere including England (where my in-laws live) and In Novato, CA where I live.MAGA! &amp; God bless you.
@POTUS Best wishes to you and FLOTUS for the best 2019!  As a grateful American and daughter of a naturalized citizen may I suggest you gather the opinions of LEGAL AND LAW-ABIDING naturalized citizens about THE WALL. Everyone needs to hear them, especially Nancy &amp; Chuck. MAGA!
@seanhannity I see a sure win for President Trump.
@MeadowgirlM @Jacquel42750745 @realDonaldTrump Don't forget Nancy Pelosi's $40 million mansion in San Francisco in a gated area with 12 ft walls around.  Nancy also has armed security patrols making sure she and her family are snug as a bug.
@pinkk9lover @POTUS @ROCKONOHIO @BestBrownsFan @AppSame @grizzlemeister @LVNancy @starcrosswolf @KAG4All @Q_101_X @theglobaluniter @PinkBelgium As a Libertarian I look at all three sides of America's Political Coin. Left, Right &amp; Libertarian.What I find best about President Trump is that he can't be bought or bullied and lastly, Pres.Trump loves his country and his fellow Americans -- all of us WITH NO FAKE SMILES.
@GovMikeHuckabee Gov, Huckabee, CNN's low ratings are encouraging.  CNN thought they could use National Enquirer tactics and "Shock and Awe" the American Public with made-up stories and highly slanted editorial comments about POTUS. CNN is a loser with no one watching.  Fox on the other hand...
@marklutchman I'd take a look at her, Maxine Waters, Elizabeth Warren and that fabulous Clinton couple.  They all live a bit too high on the hog.
@mikandynothem @codeofvets @NancyPelosi @chuckwoolery @DineshDSouza @Trump454545 @DonnaWR8 @LeahR77 @grizzlemeister @RealKyleMorris @Truthseeker126 @KatTheHammer1 @jeepsuzih2 Nancy's vacation digs cost $10,000 per night Let's hope the government isn't picking up the tab as it did when she was flying the friendly skies of he USAF when she was Speaker thie first time. There was a $101,000 bar tab for on-flight refreshments according to Business Insider.
@Jimlamar3 Good call, Jim. The meeting in the Oval Office when, according to Schumer, POTUS threw a "tantrum" was enough to tell me that these Newspeak nitwits think the American public is buying their line of BS.  BTW, while we're drooling, we also think President Trump in 2020!
@realDonaldTrump @Jimlamar3 @JesseBWatters The "Probe"? Nothing more than busy work for Robert Mueller that make Bob seem  fingers-to-the-bone indispensable but adds up to zero.  Seeing Gregg Jarrett's BESTSELLING Russia Hoax be a BESTSELLER reassures us all that plenty of Americans know a WITCH HUNT when we see one.
@pinkk9lover @lilibellmia @FLOTUS @ROCKONOHIO @LVNancy @BestBrownsFan @Jamierodr10 @AnnaApp91838450 @AppSame @RNRKentucky @starcrosswolf @whatznextfolks @adjunctprofessr PC Pollster.
@DiamondandSilk Yes.
@Nonofmybiznez @DiamondandSilk All believe in walls.  A mighty fortress is their home -- far away from any border that matters.
@diogonese @DiamondandSilk The core problem, especially for Pelosi and Schumer, is that they hate Trump more than they love our country.
@FLOTUS @RamsteinAirBase Thank you, Melania!
@DavidKing478 @Jacquel42750745 It's Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer who have shutdown the government. Those charter members of the "I Hate Trump With A Passion" Club are trying to make it look like it's all POTUS's doing.  Americans are smarter than that.
@BusyElves @Jacquel42750745 Yes, Mrs. Claus. The USAF was known as the "Pelosi Family Airline" back when she was Speaker the first time.  Her bar bill is one thing,  but how about the millions wasted in carting her useless butt around the country because she couldn't be bothered flying commercial?
@The_Trump_Train Cpl. Ronil Singh, 33, was shot to death while on duty by an illegal alien from Mexico.  Ronil, originally from Fiji, was living his American Dream by being a police officer. Liberals, how about wagging your fingers at the adults who risk the lives of children in their quests.
@pahubb43 @BrocatoJoan Some "career" politicians (e.g., Nancy Pelosi) know how to tweak a little bit more out of take-home pay than others.  She lives in a $40 million mansion (gated and walled) in San Francisco.  Even if they withheld a paycheck or two, I have a feeling Nancy would come out OK.
@Blue_Sunflowers @DTrumpPoll @realDonaldTrump Cpl. Ronil Singh, 33,  of the Newman, California Police Department was one.  He legally came from Fiji and was living his dream as a police officer in the USA.  Ronil was shot and killed by an illegal today.
@The_Trump_Train BUT, don't forget to record them on your cell phone -- or have your fellow shopper do it.
@The_Trump_Train They're usually attention whores,  My solution:  IGNORE THEM.
@Blue_Sunflowers @DTrumpPoll @realDonaldTrump The wall would be keeping migrants out -- uninvited, unvetted -- people who think nothing of bum-rushing our country's border in order to demand to be let in.  Not kosher.
@The_Trump_Train Nancy Pelosi's stubbornness and her hatred for Donald Trump plus POTUS's steadfastness on the wall will win him the election in 2020.  Protecting the USA and its people is not immoral.
@Blue_Sunflowers @DTrumpPoll @realDonaldTrump I was a chaperone for naturalization ceremonies when my son was in the Junior Air Force ROTC color guard. In each of those ceremonies at the Masonic Auditorium (SF) there were no fewer than 1500 new US citizens being sworn in at a time. Happens monthly.MSM should ask one of them.
@Blue_Sunflowers @DTrumpPoll @realDonaldTrump Well, there's me.  The daughter of a legal immigrant from Japan who got in line and waited her turn.  She passed away in 2005 but I know Mom well enough to say that she would be 100% behind POTUS.  Then, there's Amapola Hansberger from Nicaragua: https://t.co/FUVVPHUnfV
@Blue_Sunflowers @DTrumpPoll @realDonaldTrump Amapola Hansberger from Nicaragua on Fox: https://t.co/FUVVPHUnfV     and then, there's my late Mom from Japan who naturalized in 1958.  She was by the book &amp; waited her turn.  I would suggest MSM go down to Masonic Auditorium (SF) to a naturalization ceremony &amp; ask new citizens.
@CAS5050 @NancyPelosi Everyone sees through Nancy.  Hispanics in the Bay Area are not in love with her.  Makes me wonder what or who she she is sucking up to?
@realDonaldTrump  Why doesn't MSM ever ask legal immigrants or naturalized citizens what they think of you? Your Travel Ban, the wall mean protection for all of us.Thank you for not giving in to the bullies (i.e., Pelosi &amp; Schumer).They do not speak for migrants who obey the law.
@DTrumpPoll @realDonaldTrump MSM is a disappointment when it comes to immigration.  They knock President Trump, but it would surprise MSM to hear how many naturalized citizens or legal immigrants love President Trump for just that reason. But will they ever interview people who have "skin" in the game? No.
@TheBreckWorsham As of 2016 I'm a Libertarian. I have high regard for President Trump. Unlike Dems, President Trump cannot be bought or bullied and, UNLIKE DEMOCRATS, President Trump loves our country.  As did my late mother from Japan, who became a naturalized US citizen in 1958. Trump in 2020!
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Mr President, I believe people are tired of the anti-Trump "Tag Team of HATE" of Pelosi and Schumer. You have nothing to worry about in 2020.  Thank you, President Trump for doing a great job and never missing a beat!  Happy New Year to you, the First Lady and your family!
@charliekirk11 @CaryNovak Funny how our so-called "mainstream" news ignores information.  I listen to KCBS Radio (SF) every morning for 3 things:  (1) Sports scores, (2) Temperature, (3) Time.  Never for NEWS. National &amp; local is always sanitized, PC and anti-Trump.  Traffic? They always blow that, too.
@LadyRedWave I agree wholeheartedly.  Not subjugation, it's TOTAL LOSS of one's identity.  To what? A religion? Sorry excuse for a religion. I hear the Quran has at least one chapter on how to beat your unruly wife. Trump has the right idea with the Travel Ban. Let them stay where they are.
@realDonaldTrump @lilibellmia Yes, Mr. President. Pelosi and Schumer, the Tag-Team of Trump Haters, are so obvious they are starting to get on everyone;s nerves.  Even Libertarians like me. I don't think you have a thing to worry about in 2020. Americans know how much you love our wonderful country. MAGA!
@BreitbartNews Nancy Pelosi knows how to act like a grown-up? When Nancy was rolling her eyes  during Trump's State of the Union Address she was acting like a grown up?Boxer, BTW, is well-known in Marin for her rudeness. My neighbor got called for jury duty the same day as Boxer -- rude &amp; icy.
@V_of_Europe THANK YOU, Voice of Europe.  As you know the same thing is happening In the UK.  Hear more about England since I have in-laws there.  It's as if the EU and UK are out to PC themselves to death. No one dares say the word "Muslims."  Too good and too Christian for their own good.
@Cuds_1246 @fortressfin @jonvoight @BreitbartNews Love Jon Voight always.  Success and happiness always, Jon.  You are a wonderful actor and a stellar American.  Saw you on Levin.
@TheBreckWorsham @LbMoult @POTUS @FLOTUS Thank you very much, President Trump and FLOTUS Melania.  Great to see you both on the news this evening.  Love seeing the reception you received from our beloved service people in Iraq.  We are one lucky country!
@lilibellmia @rk55mk Thank you, Lillibell.  Mother was a federal government employee (55 years) and a military widow for most.  There were ""bumps" due to legislative glitches over the years but she NEVER GOT STIFFED. Please repeat your Tweet whenever you see Kamala doing her dirty work. Thank you!
@MargoCallaghan7 @leslieau7 @realDonaldTrump Thank you, Margo Callaghan. Galls Liberals when someone who supports President Trump is not a déclassé rube. Brought up in SF, I still live in the Bay Area &amp; support POTUS.  Pelosi &amp; Schumer are the tag-team of TRUMP HATE. In reality, they're the rubes. Trump loves his country.
@DiamondandSilk @Mimi_Florida Yes, and you have pointed out, Diamond &amp; Silk, salaries that paid for Maxine Waters' $5.5 million estate OUTSIDE THE LOS ANGELES DISTRICT she repesents and Nancy Pelosi's $40 million San Francisco mansion with that beautiful 15 ft WALL encircling it.  D&amp;S, God bless you always!
@ChuckCallesto Makes you wonder is Ocasio-Cortez has ever read a book.  What she's told us about her "knowledge" of the world's economy and Jesus's refugee status show me the difference between "old school" and the new "no school."
@bruxbutler @SheriHerman10 @realDonaldTrump Since I've never been polled by anybody, anywhere -- except these polls on Twitter -- I'm not inclined to believe anything the polls say.  Hillary was supposed ot have won in 2016 according to polls.  Polls are no more than hunches.
@ChuckCallesto Why is it always the same two -- Schumer and Pelosi -- who are both predictable and tiresome?  They've both seen better days -- like a couple of retread tires.
@theCoreyJones @cs00582scs As the 65 year old daughter of a naturalized citizen from Japan who played it "by the book," I'm tired of feeling guilty because I'm proud of Mom who got in line, obeyed the rules &amp; the laws.Tell Pelosi and Schumer there's nothing "immoral" about protecting our glorious country
@ChuckCallesto Well said, Chuck C.  Chuck Schumer is fixated on the word "tantrum."  Is that the Ding-Dong School definition of "tantrum", Chuck? C.S. called POTUS's part in the the Oval Office confab re the wall a Trump "tantrum." It was all conversational to me. Nancy got a bit edgy, though.
@grammyoftwins1 Everyone avoids stating the obvious about the wall. Why?  MSM I understand, but POTUS or Lindsay Graham, please remind everyone about what's happening in the EU and UK.  Uncontrolled migration and migrants.  People on that side of the pond would die for WALLS. Why are we so PC?
@SarahPalinUSA @kateMAGA3 Don't let Trey Gowdy leave town just yet.
@PaulieD55 @Satchalistic1 @luluHru @PatriotPennsy @beatrizmacia1 @kengrimes91 @marsone2 @Freed0mFirst @windh1 @fjclathome @andypanda_c9 @terri_gowin @JohnnyB_Redpill @RealLPoslaiko @DplrblesUnite @cajunchick25 @scali_gianna Love to hear more from the WalkAway people.  With every TANTRUM  from Pelosi and Schumer, I'm sure WalkAway sees new recruits.
@clivebushjd With your expertise would love hearing your take on the Russian threat. Non-tech people (I am one but my son is a programmer) are too nervous about it. Russian probe is Mueller "busy  work" that tries to discredit POTUS. What say you? Many thanks and Merry Christmas!
@V_of_Europe Voice of Europe, please let America know that the protests and dissatisfaction with Macron is not ONLY about gas taxes.
@V_of_Europe Sad.
@freedom_moates The American Public is lucky she (Omar) has learned to stop talking. Always quotable.
@TruthMaga Anything to discredit President Trump.  The blooms are off the roses for these two.  Especially Pelosi.  Per a 2010 Business Insider article Nancy and her family ran up a "bar bill" of about $101,000 while flying the friendly skies of the USAF paid by us, the American taxpayer
@John_KissMyBot @Lynnoftrumpland @realDonaldTrump Why is it that Chuck Schumer always strikes me as someone who's just left an AA meeting?
@tmagasays I spent 40+ years in "solidarity" with the Dems (I'm 65).  It was the party of my mother -- a naturalized US citizen from Japan. Believe me, they were a saner bunch in the 1950s and 1960s.  In 2016 I saw Hillary on the horizon!!! Turned Libertarian PRONTO!  Merry Christmas!
@freedom_moates Ricardo Montalban and Esther Williams fully clothed and singing In key. What's wrong with people? The PC folks just said you can't tell the story of the Gingerbread Man. It has to the Gingerbread PERSON.  I'm tired of these PC killjoys gutting my classics.  Sit down and shut up!
@The_Trump_Train @BrocatoJoan @realDonaldTrump I certainly do. I have in-laws n Liverpool, Birmingham and Milton Keynes, England. Open borders meant easy entry of uninvited, unwanted, unvetted migrants from the Middle East and Africa.  We are  not a laughing stock because of POTUS.  We are the envy of many.  BUILD THE WALL.
@BreitbartNews And, jut who is "throwing a tantrum," Chuck?
@Krm1285A @louieesqueda1 @MarkExDemocrat @cookequipman1 @OMARRSHABAZZ @daahmom @BellaInxs2 @RagingAmerican1 @FreedomFirstPlz @TheOminouz1 @italia19 @Patriot_Archer @FrizzellWalt @robeyconcrete @skoozz @casscj @Vivals @SDreg8 "Old School" types like me woke up with the nomination of Hillary Clinton for POTUS by the Dems -- my former party -- then the Justice Kavanaugh debacle and attack on Susan Collins, but now the WALL?  Objected to by who?  Pelosi who lives behind a 15 foot wall!  WE ARE ALL AWAKE!
@RL9631 Why not suggest to them that they might be happier back in Somalis where the prayer schedules are compatible with their DEMANDS?
@dbongino MSM always deals bad hand to POTUS. Also, re abroad  I have relatives in England.  I live n Novato, CA When will our MSM ever tell the whole story about the riots in UK and EU.  Everybody's afraid to say the word "Muslim." Why? It's the truth.  It's not just gas taxes.
@GOP @arkiegal411 @GOPChairwoman Schumer, however, is a relic and a lost cause.  He mentions President Trump and uses the word "tantrum." I saw Trump stand his ground in the Oval Office with Chuck &amp; Nancy. I guess to Chuck if you disagree  with him, you've thrown a tantrum.  Chuck needs to grow up.  Nancy, too.
@RealJamesWoods Not until more Democrat high hats see what's been happening to the EU and UK -- that has zero to do with gas taxes -- but everything to do with NO BORDERS, will they sober up and stiffen up and vote for a WALL.  Just like the one around  Nancy Pelosi's San Francisco mansion.
The Andrews Sisters are also on Bing's hit version of Mele Kalikimaka.  	My last favorite is Eartha Kitt's Santa Baby.  I know it's not at all PC but I just love Eartha Kitt.  Merry Christmas!  Eartha's life story is an inspiration.
@MollyV178 My other favorite is Mele Kalikimaka (Hawaiian Merry Christmas Song) by Bing Crosby.  Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you and your family, Molly.
@SarahPalinUSA @Jed42253333 Has Nancy ever explained that "immoral" 15 foot high wall around her San Francisco mansion?  Is she planning on scrapping it to save her PC face?
@MollyV178 Marshmallow World as it was performed on The Dean Martin Show by Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra.  Wonderful!  (It's on YouTube).
@marklutchman Is this the way "has been" celebrities -- e.g., Bette Midler, Rosie O'Donnell , Alec Baldwin, Johnny Depp, et. al. -- keep their names in the limelight?  Sad.
@pinkk9lover @LYNNOB57 @SenSchumer @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ROCKONOHIO @BestBrownsFan @AppSame @LVNancy @AnnaApp91838450 @Jamierodr10 @jeepsuzih2 @KAG4All @starcrosswolf @grizzlemeister I love (R-LA) Sen.John Neely Kennedy's characterization of Nancy Pelosi: 	"Billy-Goat Brain, Mockingbird Mouth." because it aptly fits her cohort in crime, Chuck Schumer.
@JordynPollard1 A Tale of Two Cities with Ronald Colman, Elizabeth Banks and (my favorite) Edna May Oliver.The scenes Ronald has with Isabel Jewell.And, even though it's not a Xmas movie, Imitation of Life with Mahalia Jackson singing Trouble of the World.  These movies move me beyond words.
@DanCovfefe1 @Jacquel42750745 Nancy and Chuck are so predictable.  In other words, BORING.
@catturd2 @thedonaldwall First we should get him his house back.  Have Mueller pay the freight on that?  I'd love to know if Mueller feels any guilt about trashing the life of General Flynn in order to try and demonize and discredit President Trump?  The sight of Mueller makes my skin crawl big time.
@SenatorCollins Saw your interview with Martha MacCallum.  Your honesty and your stalwart  sense of keeping to what is true to both yourself and the truth makes  me glad I not only share my country with you, but the planet with you. Thank you and Merry Christmas and a Happy 2019!
@seanhannity Nancy hates POTUS more than she loves this country.  Talk about pissing contests!
@nick_maiorino I contend that the Second Amendment is one of the reasons -- together with the National Guard, Border Patrol, US Armed Forces -- that troublemakers think at least twice before they come to our country and stir up trouble.  The EU and UK are already doomed.
@realDonaldTrump You are where you should be,  POTUS.  You are where the people of the USA put you.  Russian interference? Therefore they're smarter than us? They're still using dial telephones in some parts or no phones at all. Pure Podunk. Fair &amp; Square is why you are there.
@LondonBreed God bless you.  You are doing a great job.  All our best wishes that you and your family have a wonderful Christmas and great 2019!  Prayers for Your brother that life will change for him soon with the best news. God bless gim.
@FAIRImmigration @BreitbartNews @JxhnBinder The majority of wealthy have seen what has happened to their favorite British and European getaways and business cities with uncontrolled migration of illegals from the Middle East and Africa due to NO WALLS.
@Lamed_Vav Yes. As the single Mom of a son, I never went out of my way to bring up gender, especially when he was little.  Never made a big deal out of it.  Just be polite and kind to everyone.  Everyone meant everyone.  Subordination and subservience was never part of any equation for us.
@marklutchman I do. I'm a 65 year old Eurasian woman. No special treatment for anybody. Either I like you or I don't or I'm indifferent,  Don't have the time to overthink race.  All of my fellow Americans get a fair shake with me. Eyes wide open is how I greet the world as an American citizen.
@PoliticalCaptn Just a hunch. I truly believe Hillary was wheeling and dealing before the election.  Dems' anger with POTUS borders on the psychotic.  Undelivered promises, promotions?  A wall and a safer USA?  Schumer &amp; Pelosi: "Not if I didn't get my stuff."
@PoliticalCaptn Agreed. But I also agree that there are more patriots in our country who love and believe in President Trump. We all, and I'm including you, grew up to believe in fairness and the best for our beautiful country The Left is out to attack &amp; destroy. No doubT they are being PAID.
@PoliticalCaptn As far as "DC Antics" go,  how is that some of these high-profile Dems can live like Robber Barons if they aren't in actuality, Robber Barons?  Nancy Pelosi's $40 million mansion in San Francisco -- gated, guarded and WALLED -- and Waters' $5.5 million cottage?
@itsSandraDee Scotland?  Politicians have bigger things to worry about and they have to pass laws about Gingerbread PERSONS.Stabbing gangs and crimes should be Number #1 on the dockets.  But this proves even in Scotland the PC Disease is turning people into Walking Turnips -- Zero Taste Food.
@realDonaldTrump @DiamondandSilk President Trump, you are so right. You know about non-border woes for EU and UK countries.  Slovenia, Melania's homeland has also been affected. Have any wall-opponents checked YouTube?  These aren't staged mini-dramas.  Merry Christmas and Happy 2019!!!  Build the wall, PLEASE.
@ajvar_and_chill @MrGMSI_BCage Have they also banned the Gingerbread Man children's story?  Along with every book, fable and song that's gender-specific?  The world is PC-ing itself to death.  I'm glad I grew up at a time before (I'm 65) unidentified referees were dictating what was &amp; what wasn't good for me.
@alley167 @sherry25793049 @GenFlynn General Flynn put his family, his country and his president first. Thank you, sir.
@ohheyjenna @marygribbin809 @IHOP I am a regular viewer of Tucker's.   I've never heard a racist comment from Tucker about any group.  As for HOH, haven't been in one since last century.  There's one here in my town, Novato, but it's the last place I think about for breakfast. Now I have reason not to like them.
@GenFlynn The pride you have in both your country and President Trump makes all Americans proud to call you a true Son of Liberty.  Thank you for your decades of service.  Thank you for your unfaltering strength and love for your family.  You are a stellar man.  God bless you.
@PamelaGeller @MMMcC54 Hard to imagine a culture where one doesn't bat an eye at the thought of murdering wives. I know it happens among us (First World Christians).  Isn't it heat of passion usually? The Quran is an instruction guide  on meting out punishment to disobedient wives.  We want that here?
@DeeDambrosia All in the name of Political Correctness and hating President Trump.  Just like what Europe and Britain used to be (and San Francisco for that matter) with very safe, CLEAN streets.  Sadly there is turning back.  Progressives have left their taint everywhere.
@mistririter @DiamondandSilk It made a good story -- 60 years ago. Ian Fleming would have loved it. The USA has the tops in HIGH-TECH TALENT.  We are also tops in whistleblowers$$$. Don't you think that as entrepreneurial and SMART as we are there would be at least one  bean-spiller in 50 fabulous states?
@DiamondandSilk D&amp;S You are so right.  In the Cyber World of High Tech, Russia is nowhere near the USA (#1)  in money spent/invested in hardware, software &amp; talent. Around 40th (behind Norway and Ireland).  I wish we would stop giving them so much credit. Ian Fleming has been dead for decades.
@monkeyMagaKAG @mark60c @Henryhahadavis When I think of what the UK (where my in-laws live) is going through, I thank God for five things.  My Neighborhood Watch, the 2nd Amendment, the Travel Ban, our National Guard and PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP!!! God has truly blessed America.
@seanhannity Trey Gowdy and Lindsay Graham are the reasons I want to visit South Carolina.  Both gentlemen have brains, manners and a low BS threshold.
@DeeDambrosia @VicCervantes3 @kevin_ponton @TroyShilling @bocan3 @PoliticalCaptn @scottmonroe73 @Ecaruso6 @harrington_gigi @DeanLKaufman @WillyMaldonado8 @horsebackinOK @Zombie_Dog_USMC @annasdaughter3 @Stalwart_7 @PoliticlMadness @dan_libell @Fred_Cathy_Ret @Rlange66Roger @FoxNews Same here. I'm a Libertarian who is a big fan of President Trump.  He can't be bought or bullied.  He doesn't wear a fake smile to try an charm anybody.  Trump makes his point by speaking plain, clear English.  No PC drivel that you know he doesn't mean.  Breath of fresh air.
@DeeDambrosia Thank you, Dee Dambrosia, for re-Tweeting my Tweets.I love Twitter. It lets me know there are plenty of normal people in this https://t.co/TnvM5jTFly take on Schumer, Pelosi &amp; that bunch are that they are missing out $$$ &amp; deals that aren't there because POTUS won.
@V_of_Europe VOE, please continue to Tweet.Many of us in the USA understand that Sweden's  migrant problem was not invited, not welcome &amp; is now not controllable. Many of us don't for lack of news from our MSM.  Don't let anyone call you racist. You're a realist who wants your country back.
@irshroz @TheresaLiving16 Excellent questions.  Fill in the blank:  You left your country because _____. Were you thinking -- i.e., welfare check, food stamps, free Section 8 housing? You got it all and yet you "rage." Same thing is happening in the UK and EU BTW. Thank you TrumpAmericaPHd. Merry Xmas!

On Fox you get actual news and information about POTUS. MSM it's a bunch of "has been" celebrities or talk show hosts with one insult and invective after another.  No proof.  Just name calling.  Like a bunch of middle schoolers.
@JoeBlazek3 Exactly.  Nothing but name-calling from the Dems with zero proof.  This is an illness on the side of Dems. Hate without reason.  Just because Hillary lost they're brains are pickled.  Their hate speech is what will lose them the election in 2020.
@Corrynmb @Cernovich "They don't pay my bills."  Whenever you worry about what other people are thinking of you, that should be your thought.  I lived in Liverpool, England in the 1970s.  That bit of advice that's stuck with me all these years came from my then boyfriend, Ralph -- saint and sage.
@PhilMcCrackin44 @JoeBlazek3 @nbcsnl @gatewaypundit Obvious clear homophobic slur.  Where is the proof about President Trump's homophobia, xenophobia, misogyny, Islamophobia, etc.  Baldwin has been recorded.  Trump -- none of them including POTUS -- has been recorded.  Until there's proof, let's just MAGA AND VOTE TRUMP IN 2020.
@marklutchman Yes. My late mother from Japan became a US citizen in 1958 and died in 2005. She would have been saddened beyond words to think Hillary Clinton -- a manipulative, avaricious fraud -- could ever be a presidential nominee for her political party.  Mom loved this country too much
@realDonaldTrump You are absolutely correct, Mr. President.  Take the turmoil n Paris which is actually the turmoil in all of the UK and EU.  Nobody wants to admit that walls would have prevented the problems that they're having with grooming gangs among other crimes.  Give them time.  Bless you,
@zeunq @V_of_Europe Saw the same reports with the BBC, Christian Science Monitor, and The Guardian.
@DadyChery Keep Tweeting about Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation.  Recent signs that the truth about the Foundation are breaking. What it promised to Haiti and did not deliver should be made public knowledge.  Worse than any Ponzi Scheme at Haiti's expense.  Thank you.
@zeunq @V_of_Europe Here's the link to the BBC article I cited earlier that mentions migrants from Turkey:		https://t.co/R1TIAhkdEf
@FLOTUS Christmas wishes and every best wish for 2019!  You're doing a beautiful job.  Ignore critics. Their resumes, BTW,  don't the word "polyglot."  They have to look up that word anyway. You are gracious, kind, tolerant, intelligent, wise. and MULTILINGUAL.. You're the BEST!
@zeunq @V_of_Europe https://t.co/FR6JGSoaLt		Hope this link comes through OK.
@zeunq @V_of_Europe Syria tops the asylum seekers list in both the UK and EU.  Turkey is well represented according to BBC reports.  Migrants in both cases are economic migrants.
@V_of_Europe VOE, please tell America and President Trump (although I think he knows)the turmoil is not ONLY over gas taxes.  Migrants from Syria, Turkey, Ghana, Nigeria , Eritrea, Sudan and other Middle East and African countries are besieging and throttling your countries. A wall? YES! YES!
@SarahPalinUSA So that's why Mueller wants wants to drag out this nonsense forever.  Destroying a life or two along the way is nothing but $$$$$.  Or in Hillary's words:  "What difference does it make now?"
@superyayadize @lilibellmia Sad.  Certainly knows how to tip her hand, though.
@richntiiff @TrumperSeaney @barmore27 Judges are getting wise to lawsuits claiming profiling and Islamophobia. Say or mutter or shout "Allah Akbar" on a full plane about to take off, get thrown off the plane, instant indignant Muslim with a lawsuit. It's happened enough times that it's become cliche.
@Datestamp @mike_morbius @_elizaaaaaa Great idea to broadcast on Twitter.  I'm here in Novato, California wishing I could help. Gave a heads-up to in-laws in Liverpool, Birmingham and Milton Keynes just in case. Hope you're daughter is better.  Lucky she has such a loving father.  Christmas love to both of you.
@Chrysotheras @V_of_Europe Turmoil in the EU and UK is the reason I believe President Trump will win "big time" in 2020.  I have in-laws n England.  Other Americans have relatives in the EU and UK or may travel there in 2019 and 2020.  By then even Pelosi and Schumer will be saying BUILD THE WALL.
@V_of_Europe Please keep tweeting.  We in the US seldom hear any news from our MSM.   You are not an alarmist or reactionary.  You're simply showing us what  is real and happening now.  Thank you very much, from Novato, California
@grammyoftwins1 Nancy knows how to make a dollar stretch.  Even in San Francisco.
@littlerichard_ Wonderful to see you on YouTube and your interview at the Camp Meeting was especially heartening and inspiring  Have a wonderful Christmas and beautiful new year!  God bless you always!  The Hicks Family, Novato, California
@charliekirk11 YES TIMES TEN.
@RedPillBlackMan @Sweet_PeaBelle Sacrificial SCAPEGOAT.  Mueller, didn't impress anyone.  Mueller is the criminal. I am so sorry, General Flynn.
@Classic_picx @zerohedge You sure?  Kind of looks like Mel Gibson.
@winstonCovfefe @regier_steven Islam has shown the UK and the EU is that they is that they don't want to assimilate, think the First, Free World that they have moved into is evil, have done nothing for the countries they've relocated to except demand welfare, free housing and food.  Travel ban, anyone?
@JayneQPatriot @Airbornex82nd @StephenKing @POTUS Schumer and Pelosi should spend a little more time watching Fox.  Report on wall in Israel keeps bad people out.  Not "immoral." Just saves lives.  Chuck and Nancy need to be reminded about 9/11?  Seriously?
@SherylGrant10 @proffitt_judy NO fake smiles. No PC BS.  Just gets the job done and HE LOVES THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!  Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
@V_of_Europe @MichaelSowerby6 I always look at these stories as the reason President Trump will win by a landslide in 2020.  Walls, yes. Travel Ban, yes.  The UK and EU are dying.
@USNationalGuard I live in Novato, California.  When I go down 101 near our Marin Civic Center I see an "Armory" sign near the exit I take .Is that for the National Guard?  Thank you for your service.  It's very reassuring to know you're here.   Merry Christmas!  Happy New Year!
@TrumpTruthTalk @Rbigzs President Trump LOVES OUR COUNTRY.  THANK GOD!  I look at England (where my in-laws live) and pray and MOURN everyday.  I lived there for eight years in the 1970s.  There's bad news each day, London, Calais, the Chunnel STRASBOURG.  TRUMP in 2020.  No sweat.
@Wblscott1 @nancy_hamm1 Brilliant.
@GovMikeHuckabee Gov. Huckabee words of wisdom.  Gates, fences, walls and armed guards for Nancy in San Francisco.  But what the hey?  Hope you and your family have the best Christmas ever and Happy 2019!  MAGA
@ChuckCallesto Hope you don't mind my sending a link.  GoFundMe for Dr. Ford spent on home improvement and not MeToo benefit:	https://t.co/FUAzCJCfny
@erik0015 I'm kind of new to Twitter.  Do you know how to broadcast? Here's a link re Dr. Ford's home construction:	https://t.co/FUAzCJCfny
@ChuckCallesto There is evidence (construction permits filed in Santa Cruz), however, that the GoFundMe account money ($700,000+) much of it was spent on renovations to her Santa Cruz beach house. Where is the outrage from donors? What happened to MeToo causes? Only Dr. Ford's Pot of Gold?
@JamesALyonsJr @JDjwhite54 Thank you for your service, Admiral.  Rest in peace.
@sewwutnow Poetic Justice in the Bargain Bin
@winstonCovfefe @DeniseA98043983 My late mother was a naturalized US citizen from Japan. We lived next to the Presidio in SF where she worked. One childhood memory was pausing at 4:45 pm when the parade ground cannon fired. It gave her pride to respect all American customs.Don't get people who disrespect the USA
@SarahPalinUSA @Suumum An effort to boost CNN's subterranean ratings.
@_I_LikeTurtles @jojoh888 Same here. Mueller knows how to rattle pots and pans, but never has any real dirt.  Same with Maxine "Impeach him!" Waters. If Ted Koppel were to sit Maxine down and ask her why impeach POTUS? Would she be able come up with more than "because I hate his guts'? Probably not.
@dbongino @TheWave0079 Ran across a mention here in Twitter about President Trump's interview with Rona Barrett.  Wish I could find and thank the poster.  1980 and POTUS was 38.  Spoke as eloquently and fondly about our country and what it needs.  Please spread the word.  It's on YouTube.  Thank you!
@KTHopkins @beavan68 Thank you, Katie .While you're giving us the lowdown on this fugitive, please give my open-borders fellow Americans a hint of what's been happening with grooming gangs. It's too bad we can't import BBC's Three Girls so that we Americans can see what has been happening in Britain.
@DTrumpPoll @SueandLew @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Just like his Press Secretary, the President never falters and never misses a beat.
@marklevinshow Yes, and she can't stop talking.  The GOP should be glad. Pelosi along with Waters, Warren, Ocasio-Corte, Behar and Damon, they're the gifts that keep on giving.
@dbongino No walls? = UK Child grooming  gang cities: Rotherham, Rochdale, Oxford, Bristol, Peterborough, Newcastle – and now Huddersfield. Thank God for President Trump, ICE and the Travel Ban. And, I am a Libertarian.
@charliekirk11 You may want to send Elizabeth the memo about the UK experience in Rotherham and Luton, England. Notable "grooming gang" activity.  While they do have "Border Police," I think ours actually enforces the law a bit better.
@FLOTUS @mary44614 @USMC @ToysForTots_USA God bless you, the President and your lovely family.  Merry Christmas and have the happiest 2019!
@GalatianPark @cheerio15 Nancy is desperate and she's hitting all the wrong notes.  Comes off too often as a squalling baby.  For Speaker the Dems need a grown up.
@seanhannity That's what some migrants see when they see a rich, First World country.  BBC (on YouTube) has a 3-part documentary on a fake Somali "asylum seeker" with 5 kids who took the Britain &amp; Sweden welfare system for the equivalent of $500,000.   Asked why, she replied:  "Easy money."
@FAIRImmigration I guess someone should remind Nancy that the 15 foot wall around her $40 million San Francisco mansion (gated and guarded by armed security) is mighty "IMMORAL."
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump You're right. Same goes for the UK.  Tommy Robinson (born and bred in Luton) is a  patriot who keeps getting slammed for being a nationalist.  Nothing of the sort.  Glad to see him on Tucker Carlson last month. My in-laws n England know he loves his country. Tommy's only fault.
@ArizonaKayte @SueandLew @realDonaldTrump @buzzman888 @KAG4All @AnnaApp91838450 @ReneeCarrollAZ @KatTheHammer1 @Truthseeker126 @lilbulli1031 @Jamierodr10 @HLAurora63 We are also witness (albeit from afar) of the turmoil and crime of the open borders of  EU and UK countries.  Many of us have relatives in those countries.  I, for one, have in-laws in England.  Some people do not assimilate well or at all.
@charliekirk11 @winkiechance @realDonaldTrump It's a psychosis or it's sour grapes over the undelivered promises from the "pay for play" loser.
@FlipItRed It's about time.
@Sweet_PeaBelle @Lowcountry1Girl It sounds like her mind is still prepubescent.
@marklevinshow @cheerio15 Senility or just a poor extemporaneous thinker and speaker?
@BartschmidPam The UK and EU are jealous that we have President Trump and that he wants to protect is citizens and his country with a wall.  I have in-laws in England.
@BartschmidPam The hatred that Pelosi, Schumer, Warren, Waters, https://t.co/qxxtBhSC05. is unnatural.  It's a psychosis.  Or could it be that Clinton was doing her usual wheeling and dealing and pre-election promises went undelivered.  So these Dems are just plain rat's ass angry. Possible?
@daisy_lovesbell @ChuckCallesto Our prayers are with you and your family.  God bless and don't give up.
@LindseyGrahamSC @FoxNews @marthamaccallum Heard you on Fox. Senator, you're like a Greek chorus.  My heart rises every time you are on.  You recognize Pelosi and Schumer hate President Trump more than they love our country. My late Mom was a naturalized citizen from Japan. She is clapping and bowing to you in heaven.
@FlipItRed @TheWave0079 Congratulations, Grandma! Great news.  I'm a senior citizen, but not a grandmother. There's still time.  While I go through therapy with my ankle and arthritis Twitter and Fox are my favorite diversions.  Reassures me daily that normal people still exist in the USA.God bless you!
@seanhannity My heart rises every time I see Sen. Lindsey Graham on Fox.  He's like a one-man Greek chorus.Loved his observation on Schumer &amp; Pelosi's Oval Office behavior today with President Trump when he rightly observed that they hate Trump more than they love our country. Amen, Senator.
@johncardillo John Cardillo, President Trump embarrassed them both.  They're both too full of themselves to notice. Pelosi always puts on her junior high mug whenever she gets near POTUS.  During the State of the Union message she rolled her eyes and dragged her tongue across her teeth. MAGA!
@cinwall01 @CNNPolitics Normal people like me see through Chuck and Nancy.  Too much ham.  Hold the mayo.
@ChuckCallesto Nice job, Mr. President.  These two robber barons behave as if they're the friends of the common people -- including illegal aliens.  Nancy and Chuck are always performing for the cameras.  Thank you for being you, Pres. Trump.  None of this phoney baloney theater for you.
@lilbulli1031 @POTUS @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi Macron didn't put France first.  Look what happened, Chuck.  The Jungle at Calais, riots in Saint-Denis.  It's not just gas taxes.
@marklutchman All I have to think about is The Jungle in Calais and the riots these last 3 years in Saint-Denis Paris and I say 'BUILD THE WALL, PLEASE"  And, in the meantime send Nancy "Walls are Immoral" Pelosi and Chuck "I Just Hate Trump" Schumer to Paris for a week unescorted by security.
@charliekirk11 Any chance you could be at that meeting today?  Thank you, Charlie, for being an excellent historian and Tweeting all of us.
@PeterLumaj Just saw you on Fox. 70 years ago my Mom from Japan became a naturalized US citizen in San Francisco. It was the honor of her life.  She did what you did. Learned English, citizenship classes, worked while in night school. THANK YOU and GOD BLESS YOU, SIR! MERRY XMAS!
@AmericaFirstPAC @Stacy30824469 @FLOTUS No.  Sorry to say they just hate our First Lady and our Commander in Chief too much. Hate is a hard habit to overcome.  Just look at Maxine Waters and Chuck Schumer.  It's a true psychosis with those two.
@winstonCovfefe @McguireScotty Show me the money, honey.  Hillary sniffs it out even in the Second World.
@nick_maiorino Am 65 year old semi-retired bookkeeper banned from reviewing Amazon purchases. Reviewed Amazon book purchases re: Civil War,  Bill of Rights,  Fox Network authors' books. All 5 stars. After glowing review of Tucker Carlson book was told my reviews were violations.
@rockhall @KlipschAudio @DefLeppard @StevieNicks @toddrundgren @TheZombiesMusic @thecure So glad for them all.  Especially The Zombies.  Congratulations!  That news just made my day.
@realDonaldTrump My Dad served with the 6th Army in both the Korean War and WWII.  Isn't there a "Stolen Valor" violation Blumenthal committed that he can be prosecuted on?  Dad died long ago, but to think Sen. Blumenthal got votes on his fictitious service record in Viet Nam is infuriating.
@QTAnon1 I think she is too young and he is a relic.
@cs00582scs @Freedom2713 @POTUS These people are the world's worst card players. Post their hatred and intent to conquer the FREE world on a big poster board and have their face photographed for any and all facial recognition software to hold and reference for eternity. As Bugs Bunny would say, "What a MAROON!"
@txredneckcop Thank you once again. Mom was a military widow. She was treated by the doctors &amp; staff at David Grant Hospital (Travis AFB) from 2001 until her death in 2005. On visits with her inc. 3-hr hyperbaric visits, I saw how hard everybody worked. God bless them and you all.  Merry Xmas!
@txredneckcop Sweden and England know only too well.  Our MSM pretends nothing is happening in the UK and EU.  Say "Rotherham, England" to most Americans and they'll shake their heads. Our First, Free World is PC'ing itself to death.  Thank God we have Donald Trump! USA Border Security? YES!!!
@rockhall I'm 65 and had the toughest time seeing those little photos where I was supposed to check of the traffic lights and buses.  I don't think I was allowed to vote.  May I send a letter casting my vote for The Zombies or am I too late?
@TuckerCarlson I'm a regular viewer of yours. I'd like to ask a favor.  Please find a cyberworld expert who can help settle peoples' nerves re Russia. Russia ranks about 50th in prestige, power &amp; influence in that world, just past Ireland and Norway.They hacked US? Hey, we're #1
@PaigeMcLaughl19 Thank you for your service as a law enforcement officer.  I'm 65 and grew up in San Francisco.  We had a cops-on-the-beat in both the Marina and Cow Hollow when I grew up.  Lovely memories for me.  I still think of police officers in the same way -- fondly.
@txredneckcop With experience as a law enforcement border officer your insight would open your Twitter followers' eyes.  What they're going through in the EU and UK is what happens when there is no border. President Trump is a godsend. You know why.  Thank you for your service.
@PrisonPlanet @bullockb791 This is what President Trump is trying to avoid.
@catturd2 @Brenro4 Get well soon!
@IrisWatts21 Her contributions to the contractor and subcontractors sprucing up her beach house in Santa Cruz, maybe?  GoFundMe, my foot.
@FrozenF712 @Corp125Vet Haven't these people (and by "these people" I mean Muslims who are so offended by anything Christian) haven't any of these people learned to ignore what tHey don't like or don't have any interest in?  In other words, GROW UP!
@realDonaldTrump While President Macron's approval rating sinks 29% yours is on the rise (Harris Interactive 48%). As far as I'm concerned you're doing a great job especially with our borders.Tourists who've been to France, especially Paris, lately know you're  on the right track
@bullockb791 @auntkimstaples You're right.  As someone who spent the better part of the 1970s on that side of the world (England and France) recent changes include gas taxes and MIGRANTS.  The blow-up at Saint-Denis the other day was not about paying more for gas.  Everything is coming to a head.
@BreitbartNews Take a trip to Paris, Rob. I lived in the UK  in the 1970s and took work trips to Paris -- Saint-Denis.Riots with migrants within this past week. I'm 65, live in Marin County, CA. I thank God for (1) the Second Amendment, (2) the National Guard and (3) President Trump -- DAILY.
@WarriorofGod97 @deanbc1 @PatriotMike6 @lizBeth_Hineni @MARINE_99ZULU @HarleyHap @SGT_P187 @Corp125Vet @emfvet78 God's hand is truly upon him and God's eyes are on our beloved country.
@PaulieD55 Nothing better than a President who loves his country especially when up against round-the-clock baseless attacks. I'm a Libertarian who dumped the Dems in 2016.  When I vote for Trump in 2020 it will be in honor of my late mother from Japan -- a Dem who LOVED THE USA!
@mikandynothem @DineshDSouza @Trump454545 @grizzlemeister @chuckwoolery @DiamondandSilk @KatTheHammer1 @Truthseeker126 @LeahR77 @DonnaWR8 @codeofvets Why is it that MSM never interviews IT experts from Silicon Valley about Russia?  Russia ranks 46th in the GII (Global Innovation Index). Not impressive.  Yet we bet the bank that Russia hacked our 2016 election. Why? Because Schumer and Obama said so?  Wasted time &amp; money!
@RL9631 @Rbigzs Nancy's palatial $40 million San Francisco mansion is not only guarded by armed security but has a nice 11 foot wall around it.  "Expensive and immoral," Nancy?
@KTHopkins @Karen56213181 God bless Italy, Salvini and all Italians!
@Carterdsc In 1965, when Mom (from Osaka) bought her house In Novato we discovered that our neighbor had been a POW in Japan in WWII.  He had been tortured. He and his family were the nicest people on the planet.  Both our families had just moved up from San Francisco. Racist country? Nope.
@carysimond @Brenro4 Why are these foreign-born Muslims so averse to answering the question:  Why did you move to a First World, Christian country?
@nancy_hamm1 @Lady_Vi_2U @Maggieb1B @EinsteinMaga @luluHru @JulieReichwein1 @4Monkeybuis7 @RL9631 @grgbkr37 @heyitsCarolyn @kidgolferman @tnmynatt @PaulieD55 @Rbigzs @harjo111 @tenaciousT0286 Beautiful! God bless you.
@JudicialWatch On the other hand, Maxine knows how to make the most out of a government buck.  She lives in a $5.5 million home outside the Los Angeles district she represents.  Savvy, no?
@FrozenF712 @deanbc1 No, it won't.  Dearborn, Michigan is 40% Muslim.
@nancy_hamm1 Nancy Pelosi should check out YouTube.  Check out the words:  Migrants, Calais Jungle, Paris.  The nice neighborhoods -- just like the one Nancy lives in (SF) -- are being trashed by migrants.  People in the EU and UK don't think a wall is immoral.  Native Parisians love Trump.
@seanhannity Mueller is the enemy you had in junior high who kept piling up and spreading  lie after lie to make you bad.  Everybody knows they're lies and that the liar is your sworn enemy because they're jealous or they're just a lousy person.  American voters are not stupid. Russia? Nyet.
@AMike4761 @PimpingPolitics Mike, you are so right.  In two years, President Trump will be re-elected for, among other things, his foresight about wall.  Look at Paris!
@stand4honor Ford’s father, Ralph Blasey Jr., offered a  brief endorsement 	of his daughter. 'I think all of the Blasey family  would support her...her record stands for itself....I think any father would have love for his daughter" 9/27/18  item Washington Post.  Warm as ice?
@stand4honor https://t.co/lxIL8Vr53K.
@stand4honor Hi Cynthia.  Hope that article link came through OK.  Dr. Ford also spoke with Rep. Anna Eshoo weeks before her  "the letter" meeting with Sen. Feinstein. What those Dems put Justice Kavanaugh through was criminal. Dr. Ford should be prosecuted for LYING UNDER OATH.
@stand4honor Renovation Records Undercut Ford's Exit-Door Account   	https://t.co/FUAzCJCfny
@Don_Vito_08 The Liberal Media always interviews the wrong people:  Elizabeth Warren for Illegals and Chuck Schumer for IT tampering?  Might I suggest:  (1) Migrants:  Ask a real naturalized citizen who got in line.  (2) Russian Hacking:. An IT expert who knows Russia is 3rd rate
@Don_Vito_08 @judy_ewell Brilliant!
Time Magazine's Person of the Year?  Dr. Ford is a nominee.  It's been over 20 years since I've gone near that magazine.  The last issue I wasted any time on reminded me of a comic book.
@ChuckCallesto @TheWave0079 Nancy's nickname in junior high:  Brainiac
@winegirl73 @sofinique1 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Kind of makes you wonder what they wanted in return.  At least, and THANK GOD, President Trump has never been for sale.
@SmallBiz4Trump @USA_WORKERS_1ST "All that for a damn flag?"  quoth Michele at a 9/11 commemoration ceremony to her husband.  Michele has never been known for her graciousness and class.
@LindaForAmerica I'm 65.  When I was in public elementary school I envied the Catholic kids who got to leave early to go to catechism.  Muslims should not impose Islam on the rest of us.  LindaforAmerica, check out England.  Muslims are bullying their way into special treatment!
@THEHermanCain Too much time watching cartoons may result in Jay Ward Neural Stenosis as demonstrated by this perky graduate of Wossamotta U.
@lilbulli1031 @starcrosswolf The misogyny of Islam should be a wake-uo call to all Americans.  Allowing female genital mutilation (FGM) is a risk this country -- the USA -- should examine as closely as any of the migrants we allow into our borders.
@EricTrump @JimKuther @TrumpTower Merry Christmas, Eric to you and your family!  Beautiful tree!!!!!
@TakeAStandLeav1 5 years after Mom's birth country, Japan, was at war with the US, Mom married Dad, a MSgt who died 5 years later. Who helped her through?  Americans from all parts of the US stationed at the Presidio.Our country was great &amp; will always be great!  MERRY CHRISTMAS!
@DoingRight1 @TakeAStandLeav1 "Seasons Greetings" is bland. Merry Christmas!" means so much more to me. Faith, forgiveness, turning the other cheek, being charitable, not thinking only of yourself. Mom was a Buddhist from, Japan. She never held me back from celebrating. Mom knew Chriistianity welcomes all.
@FAIRImmigration @cnsnews @CraigBBannister Good thinking, Nancy.
@ChuckCallesto Maybe it's not a custom in Arkansas.
@ChuckCallesto I'm glad we're getting periodic warnings from you, Chuck, and others on Twitter.  You always say to yourself "God, they look so normal. How could they be that delusional?"  Hillary made me a Libertarian in 2016. Now that I know Sen. Hirono exists I know I made the right decision.
@patni1111 @Jali_Cat @gr8tjude_08 @pfenton47 @BreitbartNews Thank you, Knitter.  At 65, I want no more phonies with FOUNDATIONS!!! President Trump was nice enough to have made his fortune BEFORE he stepped into office.  And, unlike Clinton and Obama, TRUMP TRULY LOVES HIS COUNTRY AND THE PEOPLE IN IT. You know he only takes $1per year?
@jakeswilson12 @Dorothy05798698 Lovely is right.  God bless.
@TimRunsHisMouth @regier_steven Maizie reminds me of Ish Kabibble.  Or maybe Doodles Weaver.  Too smart for the rest of us.
@marklutchman @LYNNOB57 I'd never heard of Joy Behar until the Kavanaugh hearings.  She's 24/7 now and won't shut up.  BUT I'm also of the opinion that the more these Celebrity Dems keep jeering and sneering  the more they turn off Ordinary Dems who are WALKING AWAY!!
@FAIRImmigration @realDailyWire @RealSaavedra Like The Jungle at Calais.
@FAIRImmigration YES! and thoroughly monitored. A Somali woman in the UK who not only accepted welfare money in England, but commuted to Sweden, too.  ff there.  The BBC documentary about her is on YouTube.  Search Somali Woman Fake Asylum Seeker Part I"  Her take: Equivalent to $500,000.
@charliekirk11 That sounds correct.  A case in point is Dearborn, Michigan.  40% foreign-born Muslim and 75%of them are receiving welfare.
@HorseRacingCOO I wish we could see more Tweets from Britain.   2 of my 10 in-laws there (one of whom manages a pub) says the feelings for President Trump are very positive especially in light of Britain's migrant "issues." They don't Tweet otherwise I'd ask them for a thumbs-up for our POTUS.
@mitchellvii @TheWave0079 Trump in 2020 is no problem for 2 reasons. (1) Migrants =&gt; CHAOS -- USA, UK, EU. ( 2) Dems -- 24/7 harassment of POTUS. No one has shown American voters any evidence of  xenophobia, Islamaphobia, misogyny, bad breath and on and on.  Omarosa?  Wasn't that was a whole lotta nuthin'
@TrueloveBill @ChatByCC It always amazes me to see how some politicians end up living like robber barons. I think the likes of Nancy Pelosi ($40 million SF home) and Maxine Waters $5.5 million home) should have their tax returns examined and their finances audited for the years they've been in office.
@TrueloveBill It's the word "Muslim" that has been outlawed.  The euphemism "migrant" is a safe way to talk about the problem.  And, it is a problem.
@JudicialWatch @regier_steven But somehow Maxine manages to live in a $5.5 million house OUTSIDE the Los Angeles district she represents and keep her job?
@realTylerZed PC censorship, how about Song of the South? Star James Baskett (Uncle Remus) received an honorary Oscar.  He died at 44 from diabetes.  Liberals have made it impossible to see the movie or to ever hear his beautiful voice again.  I wonder what his cousin actor Bill Cobb thinks?
@Suumum @DVATW @PATRIOT4POTUS @StefanMolyneux My first experience with squatters in the UK was when I was a student there in the 1970s.  I heard that it happens a lot.   I ended up moving to a better flat after I came home one day to find a Mom breastfeeding in my parlor.  Maybe it's the law?
@robbystarbuck @PATRIOT4POTUS @BetteMidler @realDonaldTrump @Twitter @jack While Bette loses her fan base. (I mean, has anyone really thought of her lately?) While she loses fans, the GOP gains votes and support.  I'm a Libertarian, but even I can see Dems are their own worst enemy.  Middler, Behar, Goldberg and Acosta.  They just can't stop talking.
@DVATW @PATRIOT4POTUS @StefanMolyneux We in the USA have been seeing warnings daily on YouTube and Twitter about globalism and migrants.  Squatters and rampant crime have become the norm in many places in the EU &amp; UK.  President Trump knows.  Maintain the Travel Ban and LOCK OUR BORDERS DOWN, PLEASE!!
@Listing_right You have lots of followers.  I'm just a newbie.  If Americans don't think that President Trump is doing the right thing with our southern border, people should search YouTube. Type in the words "Paris Migrants Camps." Spread the word. Thank you so much.  Trump 2020
@Boyd_2650 @Cali_Tracii @RealSugarLily @JaniceTXBlessed @Jamierodr10 @magagary687 @Redhead4645 @Airbornex82nd @gbroh10 @Dianestraley @disings @Duckyv72 Bill and Hillary cancelled their tour due to poor ticket sales.  Good sign for Trump in 2020. The public is growing weary of Dems' lame excuses and predictable, boring jabs and stabs at POTUS.  The President doesn't falter or even wince at Behar &amp; Co.  Carry on, Mr. President!
@antialtleft @FLOTUS Rest in peace, dear sir.
@starcrosswolf @baalter I wonder if any of these Trump-haters ever ask themselves could any of these "phobic" rumors be false and just rumors spread by endless gossip?  For instance, if there were any POTUS audio being xenophobic, homophobic, LGBT-a-phobic, etc. why isn't MSM playing it to death 24/7?
@nancy_hamm1 Melania's homeland, Slovenia, 3 years ago had a problem with "refugees" from the Middle East (mainly Syria) became so acute that Slovenia was forced to close its borders. The US is not the first tp get tough and won't be the last.
@realDonaldTrump @hopefilled1776 Thank you, Mr. President.  We low-income senior citizens appreciate everything you do for seniors and veterans.
@TechQn They've already started.  The case of Tommy Robinson is a prime example.  And, even thinking the words "Muslim" or "Islam" in a derogatory way may soon be an offense that could send you to prison.  Well, they're getting close.
@PinkBelgium @MaryOsb36485285 @NancyPelosi Release Trump's taxes?  How about Pelosi's?  $40 million mansion in San Francisco?  Walled?  Gated with armed security?  Just sayin'
@seanhannity The US is the Hi-Tech Behemoth of the galaxy.  Why doesn't MSM ever ask cyber experts about a Russian threat? None, they'll say.  In some corners people in Russia are still using dial telephones or none at all. Thank God for Sean &amp; Tucker whose dreams don't include Ian Fleming.
@karenchaseactor You're welcome!
@realDonaldTrump You're doing a great job. Caravans? Dems have not been  paying attention to the turmoil in the UK and EU with migrants from the Middle East and Africa and their intrusive "caravans." We Americans who have relatives in England. (10 in-laws for me). We salute you!
@PolishPatriotTM @Duxgirl27 @LindseyGrahamSC President Trump has already seen what the Middle East and African migrants -- CARAVANS  -- have done to the UK and EU's citizenry, economy and politics -- non-stop toil and trouble.  President Trump's take for our country  "NOT ON MY WATCH!!"
@marklevinshow @tammyTrumpedYou Thank you, Mark, for keeping us in focus always.  Hillary lost fair and square.  Her nat'l favorability rating was 36% prior to the 2016 election.  Arkansas 2016 election  results were 30% Clinton and 60% Trump.  Is Mueller just desperate for "busy work"?  He's non-stop boring.
@FAIRImmigration Hillary is out of touch.  Look at London and Luton.  Migration has already touched the big hand of politics in the UK.  Rough and seamy and there is no turning back. Listen to President Trump when he cautions against "chain migration."  Biggest example in the USA:  Dearborn, MI
@GartrellLinda @lulubell2141 @Trump454545 @starcrosswolf @carrieksada @LVNancy @PhilMcCrackin44 @RodStryker @DjLots3 @pinkk9lover @SandraTXAS @ArizonaKayte Great question.  "Asylum seeker"  -- whether it's the US, the UK or EU -- has a "plastic" definition. Ayan Abdulle a 40 year old Somali woman and "rape gang" victim bilked the UK for 250,000 pounds ($320,000) in social services cash and benefits. For USA: Heavy vetting, please.
@CB618444 @FLOTUS @IvankaTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump @LaraLeaTrump @JesseBWatters @KNP2BP @DonnaWR8 @grizzlemeister @RodStryker @skb_sara I have been astounded by the cruelty of people who don't know this woman and feel free to insult our First Lady simply because it has become de riguer to bash the Trump Family.  To those who think it's OK, I say "KNOCK IT OFF."  I, like The Real Catia (above) love and admire you.
@TimRunsHisMouth @realPatriotDrew https://t.co/JwH8MoYO8D	Empty seats = Washington Post subscribers
@THEHermanCain Thank you, Herman.The best of the best of Hillary's whoppers is the one she told -- there's video of it on YouTube -- of her recounting her trip to Bosnia where she had to dodge sniper fire. Never happened.  Sinbad and Sheryl Crowe could have told you so.  They were there, too.
@SarahPalinUSA @MaryOsb36485285 Latest Gallup Poll has Hillary's "Favorability Rating" at 36%. 3 weeks before the 2016 election it was 32% Voters were "on" to her then and we're still on to her Just can't shake that story that Hillary herself told about dodging "sniper fire" in Bosnia. Fake news from her lips.
@ChuckCallesto Has Geraldo checked out the Middle East "migrants" in Dearborn, Michigan?  Free Section 8 Housing, food stamps, welfare money,  education, health care for adults and minors. Muslims are now 40% of the population in that town.  America must be doing something right.
@seanhannity I'm a very average American woman--65 years old, from San Francisco and live on a moderate income. Like many I also remember the last time Nancy was Speaker when the USAF turned into the Pelosi Family Airline. $40 million SF mansion in Presidio Heights makes her not so popular.
@realDonaldTrump Christmas wish: Is there any way you can establish a law that would forbid veterans to be homeless.? We appear to have enough Section 8 housing that goes to migrants and asylum seekers.  How about putting vets as the #1 priority? They risk life and limb for US.
@MAGAGirl10 Alexandria  =&gt;   The gift that keeps on giving to the GOP
@realDonaldTrump Code 7370 : Computer coding course at San Quentin Prison. Your interest in improving futures for convicts and ex-convicts makes this course something that deserves your attention. KGO-TV or KRON-TV (San Francisco) did a story about them.  I need a memory course.
@DreaDodge @Ocasio2018 Does anyone dare ask Alexandria the names of her middle school or high school history teachers?
@DreaDodge Has anyone ever explained to Alexandria about the 8 million Jews who couldn't leave and never made it out?
@thatsqueensnark @yoakumgirl923 Unfortunately it's true. Rent subsidy for "asylum seekers" usually translates to FREE RENT.  This burns me whenever I think of homeless vets.
@freddyatton @SueandLew @realDonaldTrump That large crowd stormed the border. There's  difference between that and a "request for asylum."
@dbongino Trying understand that, too. Is their Trump hatred so big it overwhelms their common sense? My in-laws in the UK --England, have been going through their own migrant crisis.They are in despair due to lack of support from their govt.  At least we have President Trump on our side.
@BreitbartNews I love the old saying:  Any excuse is better than none.
@nancy_hamm1 @ckgirl67 On the other hand, Hillary in front of a microphone as with Maxine and her megaphone, bring in countless dollars and votes to Trump and the RNC.  Many citizens are sick of the sight AND SOUND of both of them.
@therealcornett @LauraButler6 This is yet another case in point which highlights a Democrat "leader" goosing the topic in order to shine the spotlight upon himself.  How about thinking of the American citizens who live down along the border whose private property and LIVES are at risk?
@seanhannity No. That's just what she (Maxine) wants.
@CarolynGeiger5 @VChris10sen @Maribear28 @BreakingNews @Reuters All I have to do is think of my hometown San Francisco.  I'm 65.  I don't recall homeless living on the streets. Now, the homeless problem seems beyond hope.  Veterans on the streets!  Let's block asylum requests until we have all of our homeless patriots housed.
@realDonaldTrump My prayers are with you.  Thank you for standing your -- and OUR -- ground!
@CassandraRules @knuckles_TX Good point.  I'm 65. Had my only child when I was 30. It was a long thought process. I was an only child.  Everything turned out great.  He's a programmer and happy.  Moms with 3, 4, 5 kids in tow and are on their cell phones make me wonder if they can really love them.
@Eclectic_Righty @NevadaJack2 @winkiechance Thank you very much, Status Quo?  Very helpful. I thought that since I was unable to find any Wikipedia info, this must be a private school and they "ash-canned" the Civil War general's name. Latest bout of PC-itis in my area: Renaming the Dixie School District in Marin. Arggh.
@FAIRImmigration @nypost @JoeTacopino Money well spent.  I try to imagine these thousands of people, who already show us that they do not respect our country's borders, marching into our neighborhoods climbing into our backyards where they won't respect our fences either. .  Thank you, President Trump.

@1776Stonewall @TakeAStandLeav1 When did obeying the laws and following the rules -- i.e., get in line like everybody else -- become so hard to understand?
@charliekirk11 @MaryOsb36485285 Also, the ones who enjoy threatening our country and our people always forget that we have a Second Amendment.
@winstonCovfefe @deanbc1 Thank you for warning us.
@harjo111 @MaryOsb36485285 @BreitbartNews Last week I read that the current Gallup Poll has Hillary's "Favorability Rating" at 36%.  With this unsubstantiated swipe at Trump it's probably gone down a tick or two.  Has anyone EVER produced a single recording or video of President Trump EVER being racist or bigoted?  No?
@Lara53049065 @MaryOsb36485285 Good to know he likes being quoted, photographed and have his voice recorded.  This Muslim must be the world's worst card player.  He doesn't just "tip" his hand but he broadcasts it on Twitter.
@FAIRImmigration Absolutely.  The EU and UK illegals who take advantage of soft borders and make their way to England, France, Germany, etc. immediately demand "BENEFITS"  -- the pot of gold at the end of their rainbow.
@ScrewedHumans @MAGAGirl10 Exactly.  Barack and Hillary need to remind themselves about their sub-zero popularity rankings. Hillary, I love to remind people invested in the Russian red herring, got only 30% of Arkansas's vote in 2016 while President Trump got 60%.  So much for the former AR First Lady!
@FAIRImmigration @Independent @MythiliSk Incomplete last sentence of last Tweet:  "Hundreds of thousands of uninvited, unwelcome and unvetted 'refugees' from the Middle East and Africa have made themselves all-expenses-paid guests for life in the EU and UK."  Native-born EU and UK citizens are sick of it.
@FAIRImmigration @Independent @MythiliSk Many citizens in the EU and UK countries wish their leaders were as strong and single-minded as our President Trump.  Hundreds of thousands of uninvited, unwelcome and unvetted "refugees" from the Middle East and Africa have made themselves. EU &amp; UK Citizens are sick of it.
@BretBaier 2016 election results from the the state of Arkansas,  Trump 60% and Clinton 30%.  She wasn't even popular in the state where she was First Lady of Arkansas for 12 years.  I do hope she tries, though.  It would make President Trump a shoo-in for a second term.   GO HILLARY!
@NevadaJack2 @winkiechance I noticed that, too.  As long as it's not a Civil War general, I guess.  My childhood has been edited with a PC pen.
@NevadaJack2 @winkiechance I was in my 3rd grade classroom at Winfield Scott Elementary School in SF. Our teacher Mrs. Bettelheim made the announcement. We had just come in from morning recess. My Marina school got renamed and is now Claire Lilienthal. Anybody know who Claire Lilienthal is? Me neither.
@seanhannity To say that Russia has the upper hand on the USA when it comes to IT is insulting. The USA, unlike Russia, is overflowing with computer geniuses and whistleblowers and MONEY!  Since 2015 we couldn't cough up one grandstanding bean spiller to go with that giant red herring?
@KTHopkins Katie, it's been 37 years since I lived in England.  Only know from what I hear from in-laws in Milton Keynes, Birmingham and Liverpool. I'm an American who lives in Novato, CA.  Each time I see a Tommy Robinson post, my heart breaks.  Britain has been too good for its own good.
@RealJamesWoods Heard about your intervention on Martha McCallum tonight.  Thank you and God bless you.  Wishing you every success and happiness from an appreciative and admiring fan in Novato, California.  Happy Thanksgiving!
@robertdunlap947 @MaryOsb36485285 The EU and UK are already aware of how people like Sign Man have already turned the First Free World into its own worst enemy by being too generous, tolerant, and Christian. They show up and claim to be "ASYLUM SEEKERS."  We should have listened to Dennis Prager in 2015.
@vadimdovbysh Obama is delusional and JEALOUS -- plain and simple. He gave the people 8 years to prove he had no talent as a leader. What else is Obama going to say?
@dbongino @SueandLew Stacey must have thought she was a shoo-in because of the Oprah-Obama endorsements.  Lots of us normal people -- I'm a senior citizen -- suffer from "Oprah Fatigue" and "Obama Fatigue."  Not to mention "Pelosi Fatigue" and "Hillary Fatigue."  We wish they would just GO AWAY!
@LouDobbs @KLC22296984 @DiamondandSilk @realDonaldTrump Thank you, Lou Dobbs.  As a senior citizen I'd like to ask Jim "Is this how your mother brought you up?"  He's such an aimless ham.  I blush for him.
@charliekirk11 @judy_ewell Including Nancy Pelosi.  Gated, walled and patrolled by armed security.
@FAIRImmigration @FoxNews @LukasMikelionis Kamala never stops campaigning for 2020.  For me, a 65 year old Eurasian who grew up in San Francisco, she wore out her welcome during the Kavanaugh hearings.  Pretentious and stagy.  Very unimpressive.
@McguireScotty @FloridaResiden1 Sad to say but you're right.  Too tolerant and too forgiving. Also too Christian.  Hope we in the US don't make the same mistake as the British.  The EU countries, especially Germany and Sweden have also been victimized beyond repair.
@charliekirk11 I hope all the networks pick up on this story.  Swetnick is the admitted liar.  However, the $850,000 Dr. Ford GoFundMe account makes me wonder!  She's spent much of it on rehabbing her beach house in Santa Cruz.
@MilnerRich @paolodymas09 @SkyNews Great suggestion!  I love the Trump administration for two reasons: President Trump has delivered on all of his promises to date.He's under constant scrutiny and continuous judgment by his critics. When his critics from the Left get it wrong voters ON BOTH SIDES know right away.
@AMike4761 @MaryOsb36485285 US citizens who have relatives in the UK (as I do) and the EU are all too familiar with these stories.  Rotherham Grooming Gangs, foir example.  Our mainstream press makesa quick U-turn on these stories.  Not PC to mention the "M" Word.
@RTrusswell @StormIsUponUs My in-laws are in England. I'm in California -- the San Francisco Bay Area.  Can't we blame our PC mainstream media?  Grooming gangs?  What grooming gangs?  Rotherham? What's to do with Rotherham?  Heavily edited mainstream news will be our downfall.  UK and EU are basket cases.
@SwiftDelete @FreeDreamer00 @Duxgirl27 @RTrusswell @StormIsUponUs I will keep you and your beautiful country in my prayers.Your tolerance and generosity has been exploited as you know. I hope people in the EU and UK will sober up and stiffen up. Stop being so Politically Correct, Humane and Christian without reserve.  It attracts opportunists.
@FreeDreamer00 @Duxgirl27 @RTrusswell @StormIsUponUs Look at Luton, England.  Similar to our Dearborn, Michigan.  Even though it may be too late for Sweden.  As you point out, we have President Trump.  Melania's country Slovenia is being used by Middle East migrants as a gateway into the EU and UK and BENEFITS.  Travel Ban, yes!
@kayleighmcenany If she keeps up this constant berating of everything law-and-order and national security she might as well consider herself a 2020 NON-Hopeful.  Between now and 2020, the Caravan will be a much bigger problem than it was the day she tried to put Ronald Vitello in his place.
@Lowcountry1Girl As the song goes, "God is watching us from a distance."

@GovMikeHuckabee @SheepdogSecurit Karma in the First Degree.
@TombStoneBub @DeannaR81246861 As a San Franciscan who's tired of this Grande Dame from Baltimore I say "Let 'er rip!"
@SandraTXAS @USA_WORKERS_1ST Excellent point.  As a senior citizen, who was once a Democrat, I cringe each time Obama comes on and tries to take credit for Trump's gains in business and employment for our country.  Like the old saying goes:  "Who's Zoomin' Who?"
@thepolarbear201 @FloridaResiden1 @AmyMek When you're right, you're right.  Luton, England and Dearborn, Michigan.
@seanhannity Thank God there are still some sane people around.  You included, Sean!
@dbongino @Jed42253333 Mugshot, please.
@Nottherealme1 I should have said, "We really believe survivors -- WITH BRUISES!"  Avenatti is true scum.  I'm so glad Karma came a-rapping at his chamber door.
@ColumbiaBugle We believe survivors!
@MAGAGirl10 @MaryOsb36485285 I "hearted" this information because I knew they-- illegal aliens -- were getting welfare but not how much.  Don't forget to include Section 8 Housing vouchers and Food Stamps. The US is its own worst enemy as are governments of UK and EU countries.They offer the same largesse.
@seanhannity It's always an eye-opener whenever Hillary Clinton opens her mouth.  I'm still waiting for her to fade away.  Like Stacey Abrams, she just can't help herself. Both think if they keep on talking something will  change. Sadly.the only thing that changes is the time on the clock.
@mikandynothem @DineshDSouza @chuckwoolery @KatTheHammer1 @LeahR77 @Truthseeker126 @DiamondandSilk @grizzlemeister @codeofvets @DonnaWR8 @Trump454545 Nancy Pelosi, a Baltimore native, loves her association with San Francisco, her husband's hometown.  Notice how she never mentions Baltimore?
@JDugudichi YES
@JalelSalem1 @realDonaldTrump President Macron? Globalism is responsible for The Jungle at Calais. That's what President Trump is trying to avoid by sending the US Army and National Guard "welcoming committee" to our southern borders. If he did not, we would have a Jungle in every town, city and open space.
@KashJackson2018 Obviously.
@GKeile @TamaraDabbs That left me speechless, too.  Maybe Sinema was right all along.  Arizona is the "meth lab" of America.
@Cali_Tracii @TakeAStandLeav1 Get fingerprints.  Run 'em. See what you come up with.
@trumpovic02 @KatTheHammer1 @MazurikL @skb_sara @SKYRIDER4538 @grizzlemeister @jojoh888 @ROHLL5 @StacyLStiles @WolfensPride @SiddonsDan To say that Muslims have inundated the EU and UK is an understatement.  In England it's at a point where in 2015 RAF Sgt Mark Prendeville injured on the job was removed from a Royal Hospital waiting room because the sight of his uniform might upset "some groups."
@So_n10s @judy_ewell Behave yourself. Still LOL.
@RepMcSally Our family is thinking all good thoughts for you.  Don't give up.  From Novato, California.
@ASimplePatriot Shoes borrowed from Mom's holiday drawer.
@FedupJean @KashJackson2018 @realDonaldTrump So true. But like those wonderful Dems, no one ever wants to admit they made a mistake.
@KashJackson2018 @FedupJean @realDonaldTrump Native Americans of old knew the importance of controlled burns, backfires and clear cutting. Once conservationists took over it was forest fires aplenty.
@pahubb43 God bless you and thank you, thank you, thank you for being you and serving the United States of America!
@jockey_bullet @LauraButler6 @Zimrico @POTUS @SebGorka Why is it Americans conceded that Russians overtook our 2016 election?  Why is it we believed that so quickly?  Because Hillary lost?  Because IT guru Chuck Schumer said so? Hillary was a lousy candidate &amp; BTW a few Russians still have dial or NO telephones. Gimme a break.
@BartschmidPam LOL and Happy Sunday and Happy Veterans Day.
@BartschmidPam The "Jerk" who terrorized Tucker Carlson's wife is in jail I hope. For some reason, especially here in the Bay Area,  members of Antifa are considered untouchable.  You don't seem to hear about them getting rounded up and thrown in jail.  That is where all of them belong.
@OliverMcGee @charleyweems64 @POTUS @CNN @Acosta @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Jim Acosta, this infantile showboater, should just go away.  What kind of journalist is he supposed to be?  National Enquirer, The Sun, News of the World?  Nobody takes you seriously, Jim.  So just GO AWAY!
@BartschmidPam Let's hope you're in jail.
@FAIRImmigration Wherever they land they should be self-sufficient.  The EU and UK have learned that lesson.  I understand the Swiss are cutting off welfare to the Middle East and African migrants and they are going home on their own.
@CB618444 @lulubell2141 @POTUS Thank you The Real Catis. No PC Triple Talk "full of sound and fury. Signifying nothing." Shakespeare must have run into a few Democrats in his day.
@AmazonHelp Thank oyu RB.  I think Austin is handling the problem.  Much appreciated.  Amazon Customer Service is so thorough. Bless your heart.  Judy
@elliosch @mike2356279922 Where were the police?
@NevadaJack2 @mike2356279922 I saw it, too.  More importantly I saw a reporter who acted more like a frat boy trying to show up the President of the United States.  "Hey everybody, look at me!"  Jim Acosta should be deactivated for life..
@JeffBezos I'm a regular Amazon Prime customer.  A disabled senior citizen.  Why were my reviewing privileges suspended? They said I violated community guidelines.  Asked 3 times, but received no answer.  Please help:  Judy Hicks, Novato, CA judyhicksnovato@gmail.com  Thank you.
@seanhannity Right from his "I am Spartacus" moment you could tell Mr. Booker never got past the first ten pages of any book he ever bought   This  posturing punk probably thinks the Constitution was just a really cool 18th century penmanship assignment.
@ROHLL5 @TamaraDabbs @Acosta @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity I hate grandstanders.  Jim Acosta is the WORST!
@TuckerCarlson Sending you and your family good thoughts from Novato, California.
@scotusginsburg Justice Ginsburg, get well soon.  I'm a senior citizen who also fell and learned a new clinical term for my accident:  "FOOSH."  Sounds like Marvel Comics.  "Fall On Outstretched Hand" Wrist tiny fracture.  Have a speedy recovery. Lots of love from Novato, CA
@seanhannity But for you I would not have FULLY understood what took place on election night. As for your being on stage with the president, what were you going to do?  Ignore him? Hope Fox eases up on the flak.  You (and Judge Jeanine) don't deserve it.  You're both the BEST!

@RealJamesWoods @MAGALisaHartz President Trump keeps $1 per year. The rest he gives away to different departments in the government -- Interior, Veterans, etc.  While Dems like Clinton (both), Pelosi, Waters live like robber barons, President Trump is only grabbing the cost of a cup of coffee at McDonald's.
@RepMcSally Congratulations, Senator McSally.  Thank you very much for your service.  Continued success and happiness always from Novato, California
@tedcruz Congratulations, Senator Cruz, from Novato, California.  You deserve it and we wish you everything good forever.
@robertjeffress @Mimi_Florida @realDonaldTrump I sincerely hope you are right.  President Trump is the best -- up, down, sideways and around.  This country cannot afford to lose him.
@realDonaldTrump Thank you very much, President Trump.  Saw all your hard work at all those wonderful rallies.  You are the best and there is no doubt in my mind that you love this country above all. We trust you.  Every step you've taken has been up.
@THEHermanCain Oh, Herman.  God does have a sense of humor.
@seanhannity Yes!  Thank you.
@alicia45KAG @MelPolka1 @BeachGatorFL @POTUS @realDonaldTrump "God is in charge."  That's exactly what I was thinking when Hillary lost.  He, and I do mean He, understands.
@seanhannity Nancy is delusional.  She is the reason why Democrats will not get near the House.  Nancy should take a bow.
@westtnzzz @ScottPresler Couldn't stop laughing in 2016.  Can't stop laughing in 2018.
@usminority @CaryNovak @realDonaldTrump Unbelievably condescending, too.  We minorities -- I'm Eurasian -- hate that.  We are out at the polls today.  The Kavanaugh Effect, Susan Collins Effect, Pelosi "Eye Roll" Effect, Feinstein (Lost Letter) Effect -- take your pick.  We are out there and we are voting GOP.
@seanhannity Sean Hannity, your clear, straightforward speech and your lucid, unembellished thoughts and opinions is what brought many Libertarians, like me, and undecided voters to the right table.  Sean, thank you for being you.
@RealJamesWoods It's 7:30 AM in California. Justice Kavanaugh will have plenty of reasons to smile by 7:00 PM.  Many Americans saw that hearing and thought the same thing:  Dirty tricks just because Dems hate Trump. Today will be Backlash Tuesday and for Justice Kavanaugh: Vindication Tuesday.
@Troy_Balderson Good luck, Troy Balderson!!! Kindest regards from Novato, California.
@pachapman1776 @KLC22296984 @RealJamesWoods These days I only I listen to KCBS Radio for three things -- time, traffic and temperature.  News?  Forget that.  Anti-Trump bent in everything political story.  Nonsense.  But that's San Francisco!
@pachapman1776 @KLC22296984 @RealJamesWoods Hardest working president in my lifetime. I'm 65.  Doesn't stop moving.  I'm in awe.  Thank you, President Trump.
@JohnJamesMI Thank you for your service to our country.  Good luck tomorrow!  (You will win BTW)  Kindest regards from Novato, California
@tedcruz Good luck, Sen. Cruz.  I'm in California. The Thompsons from San Antonio came to my Mom's rescue when Dad died of a heart attack on active duty at the Presidio (SF). I love Texans and so did Mom. I have faith in them. You will win.
@realDonaldTrump Thank you very much and good luck tomorrow.  I'm 65 and you are the best president of my lifetime. You love our country.  Not the money or the prestige of the office, but our country. That's the most transparent trait about you.  All the best and kindest regards.
@CrouchingIntern  The Kavanaugh Effect, Susan Collins Effect and Ted Cruz Effect.  Most of all I like the American Fair Play Effect aka Benefit of the Doubt &amp; Innocent Until Proven Guilty Effect. One more word about"divisive speech" by a Dem and I'm going to ice bucket myself.
@CHIZMAGA @TakeAStandLeav1 Tomorrow will go down as Backlash Tuesday!
@charliekirk11 @maggie805ca Yes.  How about Oakland and Berkeley?  Visually it's pretty bad.
@FAIRImmigration @LifeZette @charliekirk11 Odd that whenever MSM wants to interview people about illegal immigrants, it's always Libby Schaaf, Nancy Pelosi, Dianne Feinstein and Jackie Speier. Never a legal immigrant or naturalized citizen.  We get it.  You're powerful players who are super tolerant. It's getting old.
@marklevinshow That committee and too many members of the public took her words at face value not knowing that her own father and biological family want nothing to do with her or that she has an ever growing GoFundMe account -- $750,000 --  that she's using to redecorate her Santa Cruz home.
@AstridNJohnson @BillOReilly "Telling us what to think has evolved into telling us what to say, so telling us what to do can't be far behind." Prescient Charlton Heston c.1997 said that and "Political Correctness is just tyranny with manners."  The 2nd quote must haunt us now. On Nov 6 vote for your life!
@charliekirk11 @TamaraDabbs Will their prosecution be followed by the local media?  Will you, Charlie, and Fox stay on top of this story?  True to form for Dems.  National news should be covering the story.
@lifeaccordingt6 @KTHopkins Different perspectives I guess. i'm the daughter of an Japanese Immigrant. I lived in England for 7 years in the 1970s.  Been back home in Novato, CA since.  Illegal immigration is a problem on both sides of the Atlantic per the BBC and the Christian Science Monitor to name few.
@Gero_Lou My favorite all-time quote.  Maybe that's why I like Donald Trump.  I'd guess that's why a lot of over 65's like him. No double-talking PC drivel.
@AstridNJohnson @BillOReilly I'm hoping for a major backlash against Dems on 11/6. That Kavanaugh BS was ripe. Dr Ford? Where'd she come from and what took her so long? Fishy timing as were all those other OMG moments re Justice K. I don't like being led around by the nose. Plenty of others feel the same.
Justice Kavanaugh, I have faith that you will be fully vindicated soon.  Dr. Ford and her $750,000 (GoFundMe) did not go to Rape Crisis orgs.  It went to paying for remodeling her beach house in Santa Cruz.  Her own father wants nothing to do with her. CNN where are you?
@mitchellvii @thia_ernst How right you are! I'm just a senior citizen listening to fellow over-65 pals revving up for Tuesday.  This is much better than 2016.  		Above all, our old folks want to see the last of Nancy and Chuck!
@robertrathbun @BreitbartNews @TakeAStandLeav1 Doesn't she or Julie Swetnick have any sort of conscience? This is when you hope there really is such a thing as karma.
@BreitbartNews @TakeAStandLeav1 Everyone wants their "Fifteen Minutes" or in the case of Dr. Ford, their $750,000 on GoFundMe.  What a world!
@FedupJean @BillOReilly The only time I get into the City is when we go to AT&amp;T.  Otherwise SF does not exist for me. I think of what it was like in the 1950s and it breaks my heart to hear what a figurative and literal dump it has become.
@BatzelKathy I love Twitter. It tells me normal people still exist.The USA is a miracle and a place for https://t.co/wv7uFwCI9P the 1950s my mother had just come here from Japan. WWII had barely ended. Yet she was able to make a home here. Voters cannot let Dems destroy this miracle on earth.
@BillOReilly I predict that senior citizens (Baby Boomers on up) will play a big role in deciding what happens Nov 6. A lot of my friends are San Franciscans, like me, who remember wonderful Mayor Christopher (Republican). We know Republicans are not to be feared. Nov 6 = Good News for All
@nytimes Melissa McCarthy, lovable and funny, always cheers me up.  Thank you, Melissa.
@BillOReilly @TamaraDabbs Bill, there are a lot of senior citizens everywhere in the country, including here in Novato, CA who would agree with you.  President Trump is making people really care about getting out to the polls this Tuesday.  Thank God.
@gaye_gallops @mary122514 Slovenia is Melania Trump's home country.  I just searched in YouTube on just the words "migrants" and "Slovenia" President Trump is well aware of what's happening there and In the rest of the EU -- e.g., the Jungle at Calais -- and UK.  It's time we supported him.
@TheTrumpAdmin @hopefilled1776 But then again her $5 million mansion could use a little work,
@gaye_gallops @mary122514 If you search on any country in the EU and UK and the word "invasion" you'll get to see why the wall makes sense.  Whether it's online in general -- a Google search -- or checking out YouTube, Your eyes will widen in disbelief.
@regier_steven @DailyCaller Good luck, Martha McSally!
@fev7777777 @TakeAStandLeav1 Thank you Red Spice Nation.  Isn't it odd how these high ranking models of the Democrat Party all live like robber barons?  Nancy Pelosi's walled and gated $40 million SF mansion with armed security is the worst of those 3.  Voters listen to them why?
@BatzelKathy I could not agree more. All of these critics-at-large should have the grace, style, brains (she speaks five languages) and stamina of Melania Trump.  But they don't and that's why so much ill-will for no reason.  Go figure.
@RealJamesWoods Thank you,  James Woods.  Also why aren't we hearing more about her estranged family -- blood relatives. Her father wants nothing to do with her.  He's afraid of jeopardizing  his job at a country club golf course.  Hope she enjoys the beach house.
@FAIRImmigration @LifeZette @BrendanKKirby Until Donald Trump was elected I had no idea well-heeled mainland Chinese were going to Guam and Saipan and giving birth to babies so they colud be declared United States citizens.  We are too good for our own good.  This practice must stop.
@BatzelKathy @TakeAStandLeav1 @barmore27 @America_1st_NOW Dennis Prager told us in September 2015 "Europe is Making a Fatal Mistake" and why.  The reasons were specific and rational.  Denial seems to go hand-in-hand with PC Think.  When harsh reality hits the naysayers always pipe up: "Why didn't someone say something?" Too late.
@4YrsToday @America_1st_NOW There's a generation gap when it comes to President Trump. Being old, I much prefer listening to him over the self-conscious triple-talk drivel that comes out of Nancy Pelosi or Hillary Clinton. He keeps the peace because he never sounds as if he's trying to put one over on us.
Nancy Pelosi is out posturing as a conciliatory,"why can't we all just get along we're gonna win anyway" blue nose. Each time she feigns I wish Fox would play that brief clip of Nancy at Trump's State of the Union Address rolling her eyes and dragging her tongue across her teeth.
@BatzelKathy @TakeAStandLeav1 @barmore27 @America_1st_NOW Thank you for your input. Nobody wants to talk about it. This is that old saw about what your mother used to tell you taken to the extreme:  "If you can't say something nice about someone don't say anything at all."  What's happening in the EU (Norway) and UK is insanity.
@TakeAStandLeav1 @BatzelKathy @barmore27 @America_1st_NOW I have in-laws in the UK. Squatters and sexual assaults.  No one wants to talk about any of it.  Sweden seems to be suffering the worst.  Thanks for posting.  It is not paranoia.  It is real.
@realDonaldTrump You're doing a great job while you're battling the wind coming from the Dems. Nice to know that Fox (which I watch) is Number 1.  I find that encouraging for the Primary.  Kindest regards to you and Melania.
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Always love her, but her politics?
@Ragnar13665550 Heard that from relatives and from general news. Even Brigitte Bardot was fined for saying too much about migrants parking their  butts in France for "benefits." In the UK.  Tommy Robinson goes to jail for stating what has already been reported about grooming gangs. Looney Tunes.
@CHIZMAGA @USA_WORKERS_1ST Tell her to take care.  We're saying our prayers for her in Novato.  God bless you and StepGrandma.🙏
@Jonesbr05089985 Glad I could be of help. I'm 65 and new to this. I'm homebound with arthritis for another month.  Was really looking forward to helping at the polls, but I guess I'll have to stay home and do my bookkeeping from afar. Telecommuting.  Hope you reach your goal.  Ganbatte, kudasai!
@auntkimstaples I can only go by my own mother (born in Japan) who became a United States citizen in 1956 in San Francisco.  I remember night classes at George Washington High School to learn citizenship and English.  I still have 2 of her textbooks.  Mom did it right.
@susannecraig It's always good to hear everything.  Thank you.
@TamaraDabbs One last thing.  Hillary lost. Yes.  In Arkansas where she was First Lady of the state when Bill was governor (for 12 years) only gave her 30% of the vote in 2016 while Donald Trump got 60%. No Russians required.  Hillary was just not popular.
@RealCandaceO Many First Generation Americans like me support the President.  Mom was from Japan.  In 2016 I turned from Dem to Libertarian.  Since then I have seen noting but skulduggery from the Left including Feinstein.  I'm from SF and I am so ashamed for her. Candace, you're great!
@RealCandaceO If I hear one more word about Russian hacking, I'll go out back and pull my weeds with my teeth.  This country is brimming with IT geeks and whistleblowers -- some are two of the same. Why hasn't one of them popped up to cash in and cramp this Russian hacking? Grade A baloney?
@mike_pence @TamaraDabbs @SchuetteOnDuty @JohnJamesMI @GOP Good morning, VP Pence.  KCBS Radio in SF just shot another bit about the Russian meddling yet to come.  The Bay Area and our family is crawling with programmers and IT geeks as is our country. We have as many of them as we have whistleblowers.  So why no alarms from any of them?
@TheRebelTV @AndrewLawton I've read Tommy's book, Enemy of the State.  In this American's eyes he is a super-patriot much like President Trump who loves ihs country and is perceived as "politically incorrect."  Nothing could be further from the truth in both cases. Continued success always to you both.
@PressSec Thank you for being you.  I'm 65 and find you an inspiration.  I'm a Eurasian woman from San Francisco who loves your style -- never losing your balance or your steadfastness.  Nice going this morning, Sarah!
@TamaraDabbs  Mom, a naturalized citizen from Japan, loved the USA beyond words.Always stood proudly, hand over heart for the Natl Anthem  at Candlestick Park and AT&amp;T. As a kid, (I'm 65) the cannon at 4:45 pm the Presidio cannon fired. She stood hand over heart for that, too.
@dbongino Recruiting tool for WalkAway movement? We with the "Mom Gene" saw this morning's press conference with Sarah &amp; made it go in to overdrive.Showboating pit bulls attacking out Sarah with their PC drivel.Frankly, it won more votes than it lost for the GOP. But am tuning out today.
@PressSec I am a 65 year old Eurasian female in Novato, CA -- just a very, very average voter.  Saw the press conference.  Hats off to you.  How you can stand there and moderate that pack of showboating pit bulls and keep a civil tone is beyond me. Thank you, Sarah!  GOP Nov 6.
@dbongino Obamacare is a big beef I have with mainstream media.  It was not problem-free (or suck-free) Just like MSM and immigration. Does MSM ever send reporters to talk to new US citizens just naturalized (in SF it's Masonic Auditorium) to ask them how they feel about the Caravan?
@realDonaldTrump Good luck, President Trump with the Caravan.  I see Dems are only there to hiss, boo and jeer.  Very noticeable to those of us headed out to vote on Nov 6.  As the daughter of a legal immigrant from Japan who became a naturalized US citizen, I applaud you.
@foggyanabasis @drou_bre @brandondarby The difference between your parents (and my mother who immigrated from Japan) and these Caravan migrants is that your parents and my Mom obeyed the rules and laws of their new homeland.  Caravan people? Want in and want benefits, or else. Trump should do what he needs to do.
@StevesinBaja @SpongeHarris Probably because they recognize WalkAway as a real threat. Look at the number of views on the YouTube posts by WalkAway.  Better yet read the YT comments.  Before I heard of WalkAway (last month on Fox) I walked away in 2016. i know I have plenty of company here in California
@AhmedBaba_ @nancylevine I grew up in the PC Capitol of the World -- San Francisco  There is a danger when all your opinions depend on what you think others think of you  Most of PC-ness is just "for show." It's always a danger when you don't do any critical thinking in order to make up your own mind.
@RebaBiba @KTHopkins BBC and Christian Science Monitor are two reliable sources. Searching on them and the words "Europe migrant crisis" Katie Hopkins posted a couple of items which are news. Not going by gossip and anecdotes alone. My in-laws in Milton-Keynes, Birmingham and Liverpool are reliable
@lifeaccordingt6 @KTHopkins I'm the proud daughter of an immigrant from Japan.  Take a close look at the people in "The Caravan." Mostly young men and a few young women.  There's a lot more there than meets the eye.
@RebaBiba @KTHopkins Hilda Ogden used to be my neighbor in Southport from 1973 to 1976. Migrants are people, I agree The tens of thousands of mostly young men trekking through countries like Slovenia, Melania's homeland, are not desperate people "yearning to breathe free." They're economic migrants.
@beavan68 @brightsider123 @KTHopkins Thank you, Eleanor. People should Google the city name of "Rotherham" with a Wikipedia page devoted to grooming gangs there. Also, if they searched "Tommy Robinson,"a recent guest on Tucker Carlson, they might wake up. The fatal need to look good and be forever PC. I don't get it
@KTHopkins Citizens in the EU and UK (where my in-laws live) have already experienced these droves of migrants -- economic migrants.  It is not paranoia.  It is real.  I applaud President Trump for his stance and wish him luck for all our citizens.
@dogsandcats99 @USA_WORKERS_1ST @realDonaldTrump @grizzlemeister @ROHLL5 @_ROB_29 @MissILmom @StudiosTigan @SandraSBreen @Terri101092 People are sobering up.Nov 6 we may not see a transformation here in California, but in the rest of the country, YES. Self-serving Dems exposed for what they are. Kavanaugh, the Caravan, constant baseless haranguing of POTUS. Blame for Pittsburgh? A lot of us say: ENOUGH ALREADY!
@EricTrump Saw you on Fox tonight.  I'm an ex-Dem turned Libertarian in 2016. The criticism leveled at your father for anything and everything is pretty much ignored by most people who consider the source and the motives.  Nov 6 will tell the tale. Great dad, great son. Red wave.
@charliekirk11 Damned if you do and damned if you don't.  Rev. Al Sharpton gets on my nerves the way he pops out of the woodwork and exploits any situation having to do with African Americans. He's been at it too long.  Back off, Reverend.
@GovMikeHuckabee Add Amazon to the list of Liberal Editors-At-Large. Bought and thoroughly loved Tucker Carlson's Ship of Fools. Beautiful  explanation as to why today's Democrats are out-to-lunch. Wrote a 5-star review on Amazon that said that. Now I'm banned from reviewing = Violated guidelines
@regier_steven Benghazi &amp;The Clinton Foundation doomed Hillary. The Kavanaugh hearings and the thought of Nancy Pelosi will cramp the Dems Nov 6.  Walkaway, Great Awakening, bestsellers by Tucker Carlson, Dan Bongino, Fox News #1 position shows USA's new birth of common sense.
@kazweida @nancylevine You Tweet reminded me that we need to sharpen our focus. The difference between President Trump and high-profile Dems is that he took a $1 salary. In other words, he can't be bought and can't be bullied. President Trump, unlike his foes, loves his country more than the prestige.
@GovMikeHuckabee @RealJamesWoods @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @POTUS Thank you Gov. Huckabee and thank you, James Woods for doing some critical listening. I'm afraid too few of us do it these days.  Pulled away from Dems in 2016.  Became a Libertarian but still listen to all 3 sides. Dems still name-calling bullies. Just like in junior high.
@DeniseYorkyork Now San Jose PD has issued an eviction notice.  Let's see where that goes.
@regier_steven @100PercFEDUP Great news.  Time for him to explain so the world can get on to more important things -- like the Primary on November 6.
@ScottPresler @SpongeHarris @ScottforFlorida @RonDeSantisFL Yay!
@mitchellvii @DineshDSouza Little League Field in San Jose, CA that has been taken over by homeless. Room for caravanfrom Honduras? LL teams are moving. KTVU just showed the story.  On YouTube: Migrant Crisis This is a European Capital City.  President Trump:  Do what you need to do.
@mitchellvii @azz_amis I'm with you.  Along with Julie Swetnick this smells of stale baloney.
@mitchellvii @DineshDSouza Cameras will pick up someone.  Let's hope it's soon and they can stop blaming President Trump.  That business is starting to get ridiculous.  Up until Kavanaugh I (I'm 65) had never heard of Joy Behar.  Now MSM counts on her for reactions?  Dems must be desperate.
@Stacyan55649182 @SpongeHarris @r_little_finger @racingjen The timing of all of these dramas makes me think this one is  a "False Flag."  Dems, the biggies, are behind it. More opportunity to demonize Pres.Trump for being a rabble rouser. Can't wait for this guy to get caught to find out if he's just plain nuts or a well-paid operative.
@dbongino This is just another case of what my mother would call "You're just jealous." Dan, you have a career's worth of knowledge and experience.  Your opinions are built upon that background.  This critic-at-large guy probably does little more than watch MSNBC all day and eat Doritos.
@TheTrumpAdmin @auntkimstaples Very encouraging to see that high percentage of people taking this poll who will be voting. I'm 65 and a first generation American born of a Japanese mother who came to this country legally and was very proud to become an American citizen.  Trump understands and we back him.
@Jonesbr05089985 I'm fine, thank you.  But I do think, after yesterday, the whole world needs to go to GROUP THERAPY.
@MikeTokes @DineshDSouza Happy to see 92% Yes.  By Nov 6 all us normal people who believe Dems are permanently out-to-lunch and don't rate or deserve our condolences or compliance will vote RED. Uncanceled "Forever" stamps showed no USPS delivery. Couriers delivered them. Maybe they're on closed-circuit?
@MikeTokes @DineshDSouza I thought the same thing. This bomber was able to commute state to state and personally deliver -- they didn't go through USPS -- and have these bombs appear in mailboxes and mailrooms?  I don't know.  And the timing.  Very weird.  I love a mystery.  Hope someone can solve it.
@charliekirk11 Is America seeing too many of these "chances to stick it to Trump" moments  2 weeks before the Nov 6 Primary?  It's come to the surface that the marchers in the caravan are paid and coached.  Pipe bombs today followed by another  joint Pelosi/Schumer "harumph" speech.  Fishy.
@chuckwoolery That is wonderful to hear, Chuck.  Never heard much about Bob Barker and I go back to the Truth or Consequences days, but you always got the feeling he was a nice person, well-grounded.  I'll say a bunch of prayers for him.
@mitchellvii @USA_WORKERS_1ST Yes it does. The timing of it all is, for lack of a better word, interesting.
@seanhannity Don't you find yourself asking what are Barack and Hillary doing after what they put the country through? Wouldn't they be safer just staying home and baking cookies while they watch Law and Order reruns together?  "Hey, look, there's Fred Thompson!"
@USA_WORKERS_1ST No help here with Twitter rules. I got banished from giving Amazon reviews after I gave Tucker Carlson's book 5 stars.  America needs to sober up and stop hating Trump.  I am the 65 YO daughter of a naturalized citizen. This caravan is an invasion. Good luck Mr. President!
@charliekirk11 My in-laws are in England -- Milton-Keynes, Birmingham, Liverpool.  I know about the problems with migrants from the Middle East and Africa. Is it non-PC to report it in the US?The same problems in the UK are being experienced in the EU.  Hungary's move should be reported here.
@TuckerCarlson Your book explains everything. No wonder it's #1 on the NYT bestseller list. Congratulations!. Trump's bulging rallies,  YOUR BOOK and all your colleagues at Fox will bring monster GOP success by Nov 6.  The cherry on the cake:  The Caravan.  Success forever, TC!
@realDonaldTrump The caravan?  Good luck, Mr. President.  We know you will make the best, most prudent decision for America.  It is a problem that makes me grateful that it is YOU in the Oval Office.  God bless you, President Trump.
@senatemajldr I'm in Novato, CA  just north of SF my hometown. Saw this story on Fox.  So happy to see your fellow diners coming to your defense.  Many Americans are saying "Enough already!" to this crap.  How you stay so calm is a mystery.  Hats off to you and your wife!
@realDonaldTrump Our thoughts and prayers are with you.  Caravans of "migrants"? Your plate is FULL.  My mother came to this country 67 years ago from Japan, 6 years after the end of WWII with little to nothing. In this caravan they have cell phones. Good luck Mr. President!
@dbongino We "old timers" will not let you or President Trump down.  Democrats are permanently out-to-lunch.  We have to save our country!
@charliekirk11 Thank you, Charlie Kirk.
@SarahPalinUSA @azz_amis Why did Hillary lose? Didn't need "Benghazi docs."  Her own mouth sank her:		Words that will live in infamy: "What difference at this point does it make?"
@EricTrump Saw you on Laura Ingraham .You are so right.  I'm 65, a Eurasian woman who grew up in San Francisco. Now live 25 miles north in Novato.  There are plenty of normal people here who yearn for the time when Dems were sane instead of PC kooks. I'm a Libertarian Trump fan!
@marklevinshow President Trump's adult children are a good sign that he understands how parents -- that includes Mom -- influence their kids. Considering family wealth  they seem good citizens and  -- except Barron -- they're all working. How does Mika fare?  Look to the children.
@auntkimstaples Dems are "making it up as they go along"?  They've  blown it with Kavanaugh, Watters, Pelosi, Feinstein and Schumer.  They seem to be in a panic mode where they try to come off as reasonable and conciliatory but then keep flinging it and then slip and slide in it.  Pathetic.
@realDonaldTrump Her teaching days at Harvard were based on a lie.  Now Elizabeth Warren is spending very waking hour concocting ways to make her bogus claim seem plausible.  She thought she had gotten away with it, but even the Cherokee Nation is saying "Fraud!"
@SpongeHarris This number from TV Newser is very telling: "August 2018 Ratings: Fox News Is the No. 1 Cable News Network for 200 Straight Months."  Dems can flap their yaps, but people are watching and paying attention to the people on Fox.  	And that includes Libertarian me.
@SpongeHarris Encouraging: Tucker Carlson's Ship of Fools is Number One on the NY Times bestseller list.  The number and young to middle age demographic represented by the people I saw in YouTube videos for WalkAway.  In 2016 Dems weren't paying attention. Just like now.  Oops!
melania Trump I'm a 65 year old Libertarian female.  You truly should IGNORE anyone who says anything critical about you.  You've notice social media breeds crackpots.  You are great.  America could not have asked for a more gracious FLOTUS.  Ignore the nuts.
@LindseyGrahamSC Just saw you on Fox.  Absolutely disgusted hearing how some people are behaving. Spitting?  Rotten.  Thank you so much from Novato, California and lots and lots of RESPECT. You are EPIC!
@SpongeHarris Love your YouTube clips containing testimonials.  I left the Dems in 2016 and became a Libertarian.  After listening to former Dems on one of your clips it gave more hope than ever that Nov. 6 will be an eye-opener.  Backlash!
@dbongino What genetics lab did she use?  Is President Trump just going to take her word for it that everything is on the up-and-up?  After all, Warren lied when she said she NEVER used the claim to any kind of advantage anywhere.  Turns out she did use it at a law school.
@JimHaley17 One last thought until Nov. 6.  Dr. Ford's father and everyone in her immediate family are keeping her "at arm's length" or better.  Not a one of them including Dear Old Dad has written or gone public with how they feel about her stability or her VERACITY.  Cheerio!
@Birdle2963 @USA_WORKERS_1ST @BreitbartNews If a sound bite or film clip exists showing President Trump's Islamophobia, Xenophobia and Misogyny, wouldn't you think CNN would grab it and play it day and night?  Cheap shots of never-proven name-calling remind me of pubescent insecurity.  Junior High crap.
@FDRLST @drou_bre The more of this crap erupts the more people 65+ will say "Enough already.  This is not the Democrat Party I thought I was a part of."  In 2016 I (65) dropped the Dems and became a Libertarian.They were bananas back then, too.Older undecided are going to swing GOP way I predict.
@auntkimstaples No, I believe President Trump was meeting with the American pastor who had just been rescued from Turkey at the White House.  Even CNN finds it hard to keep up.
@GOPChairwoman As we should keep reminding ourselves though, those particular Dems -- also Nancy Pelosi -- are the proverbial "Gifts that keep on giving."  Well, it was either a proverb or a Hallmark card commercial.
@ChuckCallesto @USA_WORKERS_1ST My stance against people like Sarah reads as follows:  Misogynist, Racist, Islamophobe, Homophobe.  Don't you think in Donald Trump's 72 years there would be at least ONE extant sound bite or recording of any kind proving the point so that CNN could play it to death every night?
@dbongino Antifa.  Do these people have some sort of immunity?  They can't be arrested?  		My solution:  Arrest them and don't let them out -- EVER.
@FLOTUS You are a great First Lady.  God bless you and thank you for everything you do.  You are excellent in every way.  RESPECT and much love from Novato, California.
@realDonaldTrump Thank you and God bless you for engineering the release of Pastor Brunson.  You and First Lady Melania are where you belong!
@HillaryClinton As a Libertarian who looks at all 3 sides I found it puzzling as to how Arkansas, your home state as First Lady for 12 years when Bill was governor, voted in 2016 60% for President Trump and 30% for you.  Maybe I'm missing something.  Please advise.
kanye west I'm a new follower and fan.  I'm a 65 year old bandwagon jumper.  Thank you for seeing things clearly and not being sunk by CNN and those other lousy news networks.  Continued success and happiness always, From Libertarian Mom from Novato, California  MAGA
@ThisMomHCN @surfthespectrum @POTUS @VP @FLOTUS My roadblock was on Amazon just after I gave Tucker Carlson's book Ship of Fools my rave review. Next time I tried to review my last purchase -- outstanding syrup pitchers -- I was banned.  "Violated Community Guidelines" was my crime.  They're still taking my orders &amp; money BTW
@TuckerCarlson Ship of Fools is great. Have hard copy, Kindle &amp;AudioBook.Danger in giving you great review on Amazon?  Banishment I can no longer give ANY reviews about the stuff I buy on Amazon because I have "Violated Community Guidelines." They still took my money. Go figure.
jim brown Wonderful to see you and Kanye at the White House.with President Trump.  I'm 65 and grew up going to Kezar to see the Niners when when I had a 50-cent coupon off the Christopher Milk carton.  Stay well, stay strong and God bless you!
@charliekirk11 @chuckwoolery Loved seeing Jim Brown.
@realDailyWire @drou_bre Wasn't NFL Hall of Famer Jim Brown there, too?
@regier_steven Dear GA, I am a temporarily disabled senior citizen.  Buy tons of stuff from Amazon and give reviews including my stellar review of Tucker Carlson's book Ship of Fools. Just now I find I'm banished from reviewing because I broke the community guidelines?Fishy, no?
@DineshDSouza Isn't it time the Democrats grew up?  So what if Kanye West and President Trump like each other and hug?  Better seeing this than Nancy Pelosi sucking her teeth and rolling her eyes during the State of the Union Address.  Grown ups acting like grown ups.  'Bout time.
@DianeRavitch Always a fan.The Language Police is a family favorite. It, like Tucker Carlson's Ship of Fools, should be required reading in grade school, well before our children are released to a world full of Cory Booker's and can stand half a chance. God bless you, Diane!
@THEHermanCain Thank you, Herman. The Language Police are at it again. Thank you, Diane Ravitch.  I have never put your book away.  You warned us back in 2003.  Look at the insanity happening now!  And, God bless you, Herman Cain. The freedom to think and decide freely is at constant risk.
@foxandfriends Tucker Carlson's Ship of Fool's is No. 1 on the New York Times Bestseller list. I have the Kindle, Audio &amp; paperback editions. Great book. I feel this strong sale is an indication voters want common sense and facts over hyperbole and garbage mouth. Nov 6: Backlash.
@regier_steven Just can't shake the feeling that Nov 6 backlash will be jaw-dropping.  Just spent the afternoon with my 88 year old neighbor who was born in Germany and came to this country in the 1960s.  Dems treatment of Justice Kavanaugh? Her answer: "STINKS!"
@TuckerCarlson @nytimes @FoxNews Bought paperback and Audiobook.  Outstanding!  This fellow 65 year old fellow San Franciscan salutes you for a beautifully written explanation of why everything and everyone seems so out-to-lunch in 2018.  Congrats on the #1 bestseller.  You deserve it.
@regier_steven Democrats the world's worst card players? Always show your hand -- not just tip your hand -- and make it clear you DON'T KNOW HOW TO FINESSE.  I love that.  Because even for a vague fence sitter like me (I'm a Libertarian) it makes it easy to spot the good guys in the equation.
@realDonaldTrump You're to be congratulated and thanked everyday.  Gracious send-off to Nikki Haley made to look bad by the Dems.  I have a feeling that there will be a backlash Nov 6.  What they'e doing is NOT NICE.  Respect -- tons of it -- from former Democrat in Novato, CA
@RealJamesWoods @Twitter Good luck.  Conservatives like you are some of the only sane voices on social media.  I truly miss the sanity of yesteryear.  I grew up in San Francisco in the 1950s.  I and my senior citizen pals have turned our backs on the Dems.  Pray that it shows Nov 6.  I'm in Novato, CA
@MarkYoungTruth @chuckwoolery Thanks for the warning.  I think.
@drou_bre The biggest turn-off to people my age (65 and older) is BAD MANNERS. Especially for me since I come from a family with manners to spare.  My mother was from Japan and she was "old school."  Rioters wouldn't faze her. Mom would just not feed them.  "No sushi for you!"
@regier_steven With any luck, the entire circumstances of Dr. Ford's can be aired out in time so that Justice Kavanaugh can be FULLY vindicated and he can get on with serving SCOTUS.  In my mind now there's something is not right about her.
@regier_steven Smellier by the second. $1 million in GoFundMe and $700,000 book deal.  This must have taken some planning.
@regier_steven I'm glad I'm not alone in that way.Also hearing that Dad wanted to protect his job as an exec at a country club golf course spoke another couple of volumes. I'm not saying "head case," but she does have issues if Dear Old Dad wants to keep her at arm's length &amp; then some.
@regier_steven Has anyone addressed the business about Dr. Ford's own father refusing to stand by his daughter publicly or do an open letter to all attesting to her stability and veracity? Seems Dad doesn't want to jeopardize his exec position at a country club. Heard of this?
@GovMikeHuckabee @USA_WORKERS_1ST I have the pleasure of working with and socializing with normal people. They're logical, decent fair, and caring on top of it. Most of us saw through the Dr. Ford drama. Rep. Eshoo hands info off to Feinstein and Dianne sits on it for weeks. Thank you Gov. Huckabee. We're good.
@regier_steven Still puzzling over https://t.co/dfNLVvHqr6's father refusal to issue an open letter attestng to her stability and, most importantly, her veracity.  Heard her father did not want to jeopardize his job as executive at a golf club. Anybody think that's odd?
@BrettKavanaugh Congratulations, Justice Kavanaugh!  Beautiful ceremony.  Our family here in Novato, California sends you its respect and kindest wishes for a happy and successful future with the Supreme Court of The United States. We are so glad you never gave up.
@marklevinshow Why is it that no one brings up the fact that no one in Dr. Ford's family will write any kind of open letter of support for Dr. Ford attesting to her stability and veracity?  Odd?  Her Dad is an executive at a golf club who was afraid he'd lose his job if he did.
@AmazonHelp There aren't enough superlatives to describe how I feel about wonderful Amazon and its people.The other day I was so desperate having run low on Bounce sheets.  Had an order in.I texted your seller and I got my order the next day. Your sellers are all 5-star!  All Amazon XOXOXO!!
@SarahPalinUSA @auntkimstaples Has anyone caught up with Dr. Ford's family, especially her father, who refuses to sign letters supporting Christine's character?  Of all things connected with this matter, as a Mom, that one sticks in my craw.
@scleatherneck @regier_steven @SenBlumenthal Does Blumenthal or any of Dick's kindred spirits on the anti-Kavanaugh bandwagon ever wonder where Dr. Ford's family is and why they haven't come out publicly to support her?  As the daughter of an Army non-com who passed away on active duty, this phony vet makes me cringe.
@amazon I am a 65 year old temporarily disabled woman.  After surgery 18 months ago healing has been slow. Amazon Prime has been PRICELESS.  Thank you, EVERYONE AT AMAZON -- Sellers, customer service men and women, delivery people, everyone.  You're just fantastic!
@marklevinshow Thank you for having Molly Hemngway and Joe Concha on your show. Joe is 100% right. I'm 65 a SF native living in No. Marin. Registered Libertarian.The Democrats will experience a backlash from all their skulduggery and that lousy MSM. Nice to know I'm not alone.
@MZHemingway Saw you &amp; Joe Concha on Levin. Never fear. We senior citizens even here in SF Bay Area know over-cooked baloney when we smell it. I'm a SF Native now live in No. Marin  We seniors who grew up with real journalists like you and Jow know when we're being "had."
@JoeConchaTV Was beginning to think sane people had left the planet. Then I tuned into Twitter and Fox. Saw you and Molly on Levin. You both = 100% right. I'm 65 YO SF native living in Marin. Voting 100% GOP even though I'm registered Libertarian.  Reason:  Judge Kavanaugh
@60Minutes @drou_bre Senator Collins knows and respects our Constitution. Sen. Collins also understands that there was NO CORROBORATING EVIDENCE on any of the allegations against Justice Kavanaugh.  Even the people named by Dr. Ford have denied all of her claims and have backed away.  Great job!
@BryanDeanWright Just saw you on https://t.co/PsGeYVS08s are so right. I'm a Libertarian.Used to be Dem up until 2016. Tweeted fellow San Franciscan Feinstein telling her how disappointed I am in her.Other seniors here in Novato,CA feel the same. Voting GOP or Libertarian 11/6
@DianneFeinstein I'm a fellow San Franciscan (a 65 year old Eurasian woman). President Trump won the election. Democrats have spent the entire time since trying to scuttled him and now Judge Kavanaugh. Respect, but lots of disappointment from Novato. I'm now a Libertarian.
@DiamondandSilk Sleazier by the minute and the regular, NORMAL Democrats are watching.. Now Pelosi will be calling for FOIA RELEASE OF DOCS.  D&amp;S, isn't this just another "sounds good, means nothing" moment. Democrats will see a backlash NOV 6 to all their MONKEY BUSINESS.
@SarahPalinUSA I and my buddies are in California.complaining of "Watters-Fatigue,""Schumer-Fatigue" and "Blumenthal-Fatigue."  I suffer from "Pelosi-Fatigue." She's a Baltimorean who prefers being thought of as a San Franciscan. Seriously? We all have a feeling a big backlash will happen.
@SarahPalinUSA @auntkimstaples In my circle of fellow senior citizen friends, there are some who are Dems who see their party as power-hungry and nuts. Of those seated in government the most disgruntled ones may have been promised something that won't happen because Trump won. Something's just not right.
@pastafazool2 @NoMoreElitists You can be from the Bay Area and be Liberal.I consider myself a Liberal, just not a Democrat. Today's Democrats do not allow for any difference of opinion. I turned Libertarian. Fox's Tucker Carlson is from SF and Greg Gutfeld is from San Mateo. Bay Area can produce clear heads.
@SenatorCollins I have replayed your brilliant words a million times on YouTube. Fairness, logic, respect and truth. Thank you so much for standing firm on your principles. It gave America Justice Kavanaugh. From the bottom of my heart, thank you from Novato, California
brett Kavanaugh Justice Kavanaugh, thank you for staying strong and not giving up. We seniors -- we "Old Schoolers in Novato, California -- love your style. God bless you and your family.  Success always!
@pastafazool2 @NoMoreElitists Been here for 55 years. Novato (aka SFPD's Bedroom back in the 1960's) is a "sanctuary." I was a Liberal, a Democrat until 2016. Turned Libertarian. Will probably go full-fledged Red in 2020. It's the sanity, fair-mindedness and clarity I love about President Trump and the GOP.
@DiamondandSilk @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Love you D&amp;S. You think factually and critically.  Xenophonic, homophobic, misogynistic? Wouldn't you think that if someone had evidence -- sound bites, photos, etc--they'd make a fortune selling them to MSNBC, CNN and those networks would be airing them to death?  So far, zip.
judge brett kavanaugh Thank you for not giving up!
@hrenee80 @USA_WORKERS_1ST My goodness, yes it does. What do they call the feeling that we're feeling?  Schadenfreude? I'm feeling Chuck's pain and it's making me smile?
@realDonaldTrump  Judge Kavanaugh has to be one of the strongest people around along with his family to put up with that circus.  Such good news!  He deserves it and so do you.  Thank you for never backing down.  Bullies never, ever win and you and Judge Kavanaugh prove it!
@nancylevine @senatemajldr @maringov @RepHuffman @CA_Dem Thanks for catching that, Nancy.  Called San Rafael and they've assured me that all will be correct in time for the election.
Brett kavanaugh Wonderful!  God bless you and your family for being so strong. Our family here in Novato, California celebrate along with you.  Success always!
@DiamondandSilk I'm only hoping that brilliant speech by Sen. Susan Collins sobered up the people who vote today. Thank you, Diamond and Silk for being incisive and truthful.  God bless you both!  And, God bless and protect Judge Kavanaugh and his family!
@BrettKavanaugh God bless Judge Kavanaugh. God bless Senator Susan Collins.
@seanhannity I'm a 65 year old Eurasian woman, native San Franciscan.  Never felt more shame than I did for my fellow San Franciscan, Dianne Feinstein. Susan Collins understands the country my Japanese mother naturalized to in 1958. We're all about truth and fair play. Thank God for Susan.
@tedcruz Kindest wishes to you from Novato, CA.  Saw you on Fox. Alarmed by Dems so much that in 2016 I turned Libertarian. My late Mom was a Democrat.  She was a naturalized citizen from Japan.She would be shocked to see them today.  Stay safe and God bless you and your family.
@SenJohnKennedy Thank you! Best laugh I've had all and I'm in Nancy Pelosi country, Marin County, CA  Also thank you for standing by Judge Kavanaugh.  I cried through that hearing. I don't understand Dems' hatred for Trump but nothing excuses what they did to Judge Kavanaugh.
@realDonaldTrump Terrific day! The one thing -- among many -- that I admire about you is that you can't be bullied. Neither can Sen. Collins &amp; Sen. Manchin. Is there any way you can broadcast that those demonstrators are PAID? So phony.  Have a great weekend, Mr. President.
@Sen_JoeManchin Thank you, thank you, thank you!  I just finished thanking Sen. Collins.I want to thank you both for being Bully-Proof.  My late mother -- a naturalized citizen from Japan would have applauded you both for your understanding of common sense, truth and fair play!
susan collins  Thank you so much!  I am the 65-year old daughter of a naturalized citizen from Japan.  My late mother understood this country to be all about good work, justice, truth and fairness.  Thank you for proving her right.   Have a wonderful weekend.
@BrettKavanaugh All our hopes are with you, Judge Kavanaugh.  As they say in Japan -- my birthplace -- "Ganbatte!"   Don't give up!
@realDonaldTrump Go Judge Kavanaugh!
@hrenee80 @regier_steven Ditto, Heather.  I'm 65 and still working.  My late mother, a widow from the time I was 3, did the same She was from Japan. She never complained or blamed anybody.Hard working pragmatic  She didn't have time to make excuses. She just "got on with it." She was a great role model.
@realDonaldTrump Backlash will make a difference Nov 6. I'm a 65 year old female and ex-Dem. Saw the anti-Kavanaugh demonstration.Very loud, but very flimsy as crowds go. Lots of defectors in my SF Bay Area circle. Stay hopeful and THANK YOU! It must be the KAVANAUGH EFFECT
steve daines I live in the San Francisco Bay Area. Saw you on Fox tonight. Your support of Judge Kavanaugh touched my heart. God bless you and your family. Hope the wedding goes beautifully and you all enjoy every blessing of the day!
@LindsayGrahamSC All I ever want to say to you is "Thank you, thank you, thank you!" Your spirited support of Judge Kavanaugh touched my heart. I'm 65, a woman, an ex-Dem turned Libertarian. I believe Democrats my age have too much sense and decency. Backlash on November 6.
@drou_bre My late Mom, a naturalized citizen from Japan would approve of President Trump. No, she would have loved him. Judge Kavanaugh?  She would have approved with her heart. Real Democrats are sane, mature and want the best for our country. Fingers crossed for Susan Collins.
susan Collins  I am a 65 year old Eurasian woman from San Francisco who used to be a Democrat. I'm a Libertarian now. These are not my late Mom's party. She became a naturalized citizen from Japan in 1958. She loved her new country. She loved justice, fairness and truth.
@drou_bre It comes with being "up there." Changed to Libertarian in 2016. If President Trump keeps up the great job that he's doing I will morph into a Republican. I come from SF and I'm normal.  The City used to be full of normal people. When I think back, the Dems destroyed it.
@drou_bre The more they riot, the more the Democrats with common sense and common decency (Old School Types like me) will pull away from this mob-approach to government. It's the Backlash or, as in the name of the new movement Fox featured the other morning, they'll WalkAway.I did in 2016.
@IHaveGodsFavor @chuckwoolery https://t.co/rUTERKKXgy		KPIX San Francisco interview where the reporter explains that Eshoo was the first person to interview Dr. Ford "weeks before the Senate hearing"		KPIX is our local CBS TV affiliate.  		Someone trying to pull something?
@PressSec Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA)Tweets that she interviewed Dr Ford in her (Eshoo's) office Palo Alto on July 20.Thought Feinstein was the first person to hear of Ford? You, Sarah, are doing a great job.I'm an ex-Dem turned Libertarian in 2016. Could no longer stand the garbage.
@senorrinhatch @regier_steven Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA) has a Tweet about it where she mentions having met with Dr. Ford on July 20. I thought Sen. Feinstein  was the first  government person to see Dr. Ford let   alone interview  her which Eshoo says she did.  Talk about delays!

@TuckerCarlson KCBS Radio on at the top of the hour at 9:00 am: Rep Anna Eshoo in recorded interview found Dr. Ford highly believable when she (Eshoo) interviewed her (Ford) in Eshoo's Palo Alto office "MONTHS AGO."  Months?	Big fan, fellow San Franciscan, dumped DEMS in 2016.
Rep. Anna Eshoo from Palo Alto was on (recorded interview) KCBS Radio in San Francisco.  Re Dr. Ford, Eshoo found her highly believable when she (Eshoo) interviewed her (Ford) in her (Eshoo's) office "MONTHS AGO. Interview was heard top of the hour at 9:00 am.  So sad.
Chairman of the Judiciary Committee Just heard Rep. Anna Eshoo (Palo Alto) interviewed on KCBS Radio. She said she found Ford highly believable "MONTHS AGO" when Dr. Ford came into Eshoo's  Palo Alto office.  Is Rep. Anna Eshoo the one who's been holding things up?
@regier_steven @RealJamesWoods @SenFeinstein Just had KCBS Radio on in the bathroom.  Heard a bit of an interview with Rep. Anna Eshoo who stated that she found Dr. Ford highly believable "months ago" when Rep. Eshoo interviewed  her (Ford) in her office in Palo Alto.  MONTHS AGO???  		FBI check for Eshoo?
@PressSec Saw you on Fox. You are 100% right. President Trump makes all the right moves daily. Democrats are losing ground. Dems lost me in 2016. After 40 years  I said "Enough already!" Hillary made me defect. Now that I've seen Dianne's skulduggery I know I did the right thing.
@BrettKavanaugh Keep the faith! We're all behind you. Love social media.  I'm in Novato, CA,  just north of San Francisco. Ashamed and dismayed by my fellow San Franciscan, Dianne Feinstein. Pray for her, too. God bless you and your family and stay strong.  Don't give up!
@realDonaldTrump Thank you, Mr. President for keeping the faith. Just heard on Fox that there's NOTHING in that FBI report. It's probably occurred to you, too.  Fox ratings are a good gauge of who voters are listening to.  If Fox is high so are you. God bless Judge Kavanaugh!
@chuckwoolery Always with that self-serving agenda! Next they'll want to canonize Keith Ellison.
@RealJamesWoods @regier_steven @SenFeinstein Dianne Feinstein!  Another reason of why I turned Libertarian in 2016. "Do as I say, not as I do" is the Democrats' philosophy.  Thank goodness for social media.  Dianne doesn't mind destroying lives for her own personal gain and her party's power. What a disgusting hypocrite!
tammy bruce Delighted to hear about WalkAway this morning on Fox. I'm a 65 year old San Franciscan who now lives in Novato, CA Turned Libertarian in 2016 Other people in my age group I know have dumped the Dems. Heard you tonight on Hannity. You're so right. It's backlash time.
@NRATV @dbongino I believes when it comes to the nastiest of protesters, there's money behind the madness Whether it's Go Fund Me or a direct cash payout I find it hard to believe that kooks always know exactly where to assail their victims all the time on their own.  Can the FBI look into that?
@McConnellPress Thank you for being there and for you being the calm go-between that you are.  I'm sitting here in Novato, California (Democrat turned Libertarian).  At 65, I'm wondering what happened to people? Is normal just not in fashion anymore?  God bless you always!
@HassaninDC @MbmpPB7 @mitchellvii @USA_WORKERS_1ST @nytimes Isn't it a sign that the Democrats are desperate. Like a magician's misdirection. Get people's attention with uncorroborated allegations and then the infamous "ice throwing" incident and hope no one is paying attention to the slime oozing out of your party
@realDonaldTrump Thought I'd go straight to the top to ask:  Collusion?  None needed.Hillary was First Lady of Arkansas for 12 years  Arkansas results 2016: Trump 60% and Clinton 30%. Mr. President, does an investigation really seem necessary?In my mind, you won fair and square.
@realDonaldTrump  Hillary claims you are sexist, Islamaphobic, racist -- the whole nine yards. In all your long career business and political career why is that no one -- CNN, MSNBC, etc -- has a single sound bite of you being that way. Empty gossip? Why don't more voters ask?
@mitchellvii @USA_WORKERS_1ST If one dirty trick doesn't work it's immediately followed by another  National Enquirer-style attack on Judge Kavanaugh's character. There must be plenty of citizens, of all ages all over the country -- including Blue States --  who are thinking "Give me a bleeping break!"
@RobManess @USA_WORKERS_1ST @BillCassidy I agree. I do, however, feel she has problems other than just a bad memory.  Sadly, Judge Kavanaugh and his family have to suffer. In my heart, I know he'll come out ahead despite anything  Dems can dredge up or INVENT.
@FDRLST @USA_WORKERS_1ST We 65+ types know dirty tricks when we see hear the. Heard about WalkAway today on Fox. I figure every time Chuck Schumer opens his mouth another 65+ Dem walks away. They really should use Matt Monro's hit "Walk Away": "Walk away, please go before you  throw your life away."
@RedKrestBucki President Trump is a patriot who cannot be bullied and he cannot be BOUGHT!  There is no doubt in my mind that he LOVES OUR COUNTRY!
@wave18_red Mom was a Buddhist who understood and loved the history of our country and never let me take it for granted. After all, Willie Mays played centerfield in our new hometown. She did not become a citizen until 1958, from then on she was high-octane red, white and blue. Vote Nov 6!
@auntkimstaples I'm working at the polls. At 65 I always work at the polls in memory of my late Mom from Osaka. She took her US citizenship VERY SERIOUSLY. Night school at George Washington High School in SF. Naturalized in 1958 at the old Federal Building on Golden Gate Ave in San Francisco.
@Knight769 Bad?  Yes. The working word for me is "demented." A Clockwork Orange dementia.  Especially the minority members (as in minority members of the Senate) of the judicial committee.  Like Alex and his Droogs they mindlessly and coldly go for the jugular of the enemy.
@USA_WORKERS_1ST I think I cried as much for Dr. Ford as I did for Judge Kavanaugh and his family. The Judicial Committee is like Alex and his Droogs in A Clockwork Orange.  CONFIRM KAVANAUGH NOW!!! This week.  I'm with Mitch McConnell:  Stop this nonsense and vote this week.
@eli_abbey @realDonaldTrump I also believe it is the reason that many people  like me, who were once Democrats (I'm 65) have turned away in DISGUST.  Anything goes as long as it's anti-Trump.  This is what passes for humor to a Democrat?  Sociopathic crap.  I'm Libertarian now.  Will be GOP by 2020.
@Jess00081953 Yes, definitely the last straw.  And as I was making out my paper form to switch party affiliation to Libertarian, in my mind ran the words "Enough already!" Which are the same words whenever I see Chuck Schumer on my TV screen.  One of these days I'll let the remote fly!
@senatemajldr I was raised in San Francisco and Marin.  I'm 65, have dumped the Democrats and become a Libertarian.  At the rate President Trump is going I'll be GOP soon. You, Sen. McConnell is what America means to me. Your statement yesterday summed it all up for me. SUPERB!
@JeffBezos Raise for Amazon employees? YES! YES! Customer since 2006 now a temporarily disabled senior citizen. Amazon = A godsend. Terrific service - fulfillment, delivery, customer service. Always do survey on Customer Service ratings e-mails. Amazon employees are stupendous!
@SebGorka I'm 65, a Eurasian woman, grew up in San Francisco and now live in Marin. Democrats?  Dumped them in 2016. Libertarian now. Will probably turn Republican for 2020. Disgusting at the way Judge Kavanaugh and President Trump have been treated. Feinstein? Deplorable!!!
#walkaway Thank God you're there. I'm 65, raised in SF 1950s and 1960s. Now live in Marin.  I'm not alone in saying the Dems are thugs and bullies -- and robber barons. Their dirty tricks thanks to Feinstein against Kavanaugh?  Libertarian now, but I'll be a Republican in 2020.
#walkaway Saw Brandon on Fox. What a relief! Thought I was one of only few. I'm a 65 year old Eurasian woman from San Francisco who now lives in Marin. Last straw? Clinton. Turned Libertarian. Last week's affirming straw?  Feinstein!!! Now turning Republican for 2020 election.
@realDonaldTrump Judge Kavanaugh can't give up. Senior citizens -- I'm one -- don't like this skulduggery from the Democrats, especially Feinstein. I've left them after 40 years in 2016. I'm not alone.  A trend?  Let's hope so.  Brett could have been our son.  Don't give up!
@BrettKavanaugh Whatever you do, DON'T GIVE UP!
@realDonaldTrump ACLU is now anti Kavanaugh? Like Feinstein's hiding the Ford letter since July, ACLU has shown itself. Even as a SF Bay Area native, I made the right move dropping out of the Dem Party in 2016. At 65, I'm too old for this BS. I'm not alone. We are the backlash.
@GeorgeWBush Respect and love from Novato, California.  Left the Democrats in 2016.  Saw the newsflash on Fox re your urging on the vote for Judge Kavanaugh.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!  This senior citizen is so grateful and hopeful.  Regards to you and your family!
@dbongino Don't underestimate senior citizens. I'm a San Franciscan (65) who lives in Novato, CA. I and my pals have given up on the Dems. Yesterday was ENOUGH. Dianne Feinstein is dead to me. President Trump is us.  We love Kavanaugh and his family.  Dr. Ford was a victim, too.
@BrettKavanaugh All good thoughts, Judge Kavanaugh, from our family in Novato, California to you and yours.
@realDonaldTrump Our seniors, including me, are thinking all good thoughts for Judge Brett Kavanaugh in Novato, California.  Thank you, President Trump.  Excellent choice.
@realDonaldTrump  I'm in the SF Bay Area.  Local news is "Fake News" you allude to.  Yesterday's coverage included statements by Speier, Warren, Feinstein and Blumenthal and little else.  KGO and Fox KTVU.  Heavily edited real news.  Sad.  Good luck to you and Judge Kavanaugh!
@surfthespectrum I'm 65 and turned my affiliation from Democrat to Libertarian because of the viciousness of the new Dem breed.  Good to hear from you. We prove normal people do come out of Marin who feel for Judge Kavanaugh and his family. God bless you and yours.   God bless Lindsey Graham!
@MrsKavy All good thoughts and wishes from Novato, California.  God bless you, your children and Judge Kavanaugh.
Judge Kavanaugh All good thoughts in Novato, California.  Yes, there are normal people in the San Francisco Bay Area.  God bless you, your wife and your children.  And a big God bless you to Sen. Lindsey Graham.
@realDonaldTrump Watched news on KGO (SF).  Re hearing showed two interviews heavily slanted against Judge Kavanaugh --Jackie Speier and Elizabeth Warren  Talk about The Twilight Zone. No Lindsey Graham.  God bless you, Judge Kavanaugh and Sen. Lindsey Graham -- all superstars.
Lindsey Graham. As a San Franciscan and an ex-Democrat, I just want to say "Thank you, thank you, thank you!"  This senior citizen admires and respects Brett Kavanaugh  I loved what you had to say and so did millions of other Americans.  God bless you!
@realDonaldTrump Thank goodness for you and Fox. Plenty of people like me dumped the Dems last election.Causes? Watching Fox. Seeing you at the RNC Convention and hearing all those great speakers.Clarity and plain-speaking is what will win the day.  Go get 'em, Brett Kavanaugh!
brett kavanaugh  Stay strong!  We senior citizens knew from the beginning there was something very, very wrong about this whole mess.  Several of us are rehabilitated ex-Democrats.  The cooked up lies about you was the limit.  God bless you and your family!  Success always!
@realDonaldTrump Glad I stopped being a Democrat.The lies,the dirty tricks. Hope Judge Kavanaugh is none the worse for their perfidy and power moves.  I'm a senior citizen who hopes they get damaged big time by the backlash. They all should be ashamed especially Feinstein.
@realDonaldTrump Globalism &amp; multiculturalism need to be countered.Heard your words today. Please find a way to inform our fellow citizens about the chaos created by open borders and immigrants in the EU and UK. I have in-laws in Liverpool and Birmingham.They know &amp; I've heard.
@realDonaldTrump Great UN speech! There probably wasn't one person in that audience  who didn't wish that they were YOU.  Thank you for being a proud American. My Japanese mother was very proud to become a US citizen back in 1958 because she knew what it meant not to be one.
@SenateMajLdr "Side show"?  How right you are. As a San Franciscan former Democrat wouldn't it be better to let the Dems go on making fools of themselves. It got me to dump the party in 2016.  Brett Kavanaugh and his family don't deserve this treatment.  God bless you and them.
@FLOTUS Wonderful job, Melania! My best to you and Mr. President. I'm a senior citizen learning to cope with arthritis with a brace and a cane.  I promise as soon as I'm "road-worthy" again, I'll be out working. After my first paycheck I'll add to the fund.  God bless you both!
kavanaugh Left the Democrats after 40 years in 2016.  Too many signs that there is something very, very wrong with them. Dirty tricks and pathological hatred  for Trump. Their attacks on you is on also e of those signs.  Good luck, stay well and love to your wife and children.
@ashdawn614 I hope you realize how much of a rooting section Brett and you have in California even in a blue county like Marin. I (former Dem) turned Libertarian in 2016. "Dirty Tricks" is the Democratic Party's standard. Shameful. God bless you, Brett and your children always!
@realDonaldTrump One of the greatest things about your presidency is that everyone pays attention now.  I'll be working as a clerk on November 6 in Novato, California.  Novato is a medium suburban town and we know how to turn out to vote and pay attention.
brett kavanaugh Stay strong.  We live in a strange world with people who are desperate to be in the limelight even when it's at someone else's expense.  Give it your best.  We're all behind you.  Love and tons of RESPECT from Novato, California.
Brett Kavanaugh We seniors have every faith in you.  Stay strong and don't let this Grand Opera throw you off track.  We old folks have seen it all and this is just the Democrats playing hateful political games at your expense.  We know better.  Good luck and keep he faith!
@realDonaldTrump Stay strong, Mr. President.  We seniors have Fox tuned in all day, everyday.  We believe in you and Brett Kavanaugh.  You'll both make out fine.  As my late Japanese mother used to say, "Ganbatte, kudasai!"  (Good luck and don't give up). You're the best!
@GOPChairwoman Saw you on Fox.  You’re absolutely right. I’m 65, grew up in San Francisco, live in Marin north of SF.  Disappointed in Feinstein.  Just as shallow as the rest.  Turned Libertarian this year.
Brett Kavanaugh Keep the faith.  Nothing dismays me more than the 21st century Democrats who think they're scooping for The National Enquirer.  I'm a former Dem. You're great.  Good luck.
@realDonaldTrump We old people understand the value of "unnamed sources." ZERO.  We over-65's  are  proud of you for standing up to all that anti-Trump crap.  I'm not alone when I say the Dem's will find that there's a back-splash to all this venom spitting.  Right, Maxine?
jon voight  Wonderful to see you on Mark Levin. Just Tweeted him and said my neck is aching from all the nodding I did. God is watching us. At the thought of Hillary as POTUS I turned Libertarian. Chances are by 2020 when I'm 68 I'll be GOP.  Stay well. Much love and MAGA
@marklevinshow Thank you so much for having Jon Voight on. My neck is aching from all the nodding I did.  Born in Japan and raised in San Francisco and a Democrat up until the 2016 election.  I love President Trump.  No PC drivel and he cannot be bought. Love Jon V &amp; you Mark L.
@realDonaldTrump Hang in there, Mr. President. The editorial?  I'm in the written by a Times staffer camp. The Times is the most anti of anti-Trump people. Why not fabricate?Helps sales. Maybe it was their editor-in-chief's Aunt Lulu.  I don't believe it was one of your people.
@realDonaldTrump I did take the time to listen to what Obama had to say this morning. So sad. He's still in the "any excuse is better than none" mode. President Trump,I want to thank you again for remembering everyone in the country deserves to be heard by you.  Rally on!
@THEHermanCain On Fox tonight you brought up the idea of the anonymous letter being written by a NYT staffer.  I thought that, too.  It was fishy from the get-go.  Senior citizens like me have been around the block &amp; know when something smells. I'm glad you're there. Bless you.
@THEHermanCain Thank you, thank you, thank you!  I'm a senior citizen who lives in Novato, CA,  just north of my hometown, San Francisco. I'm fed up with 21st century Democrats who take thuggery to a whole new level.  I'm an ex-Democrat and proud of it. Take care and MAGA.
@realDonaldTrump What kind of newspaper is the Wall Street Journal if it can't identify the "Who"?  Fishy.  That's what a lot of us think.  Too many things about the anti-Trump slagging is fishy.  Don't despair, Mr. President.  Lots of us here in California want you in 2020.
@realDonaldTrump As a senior citizen I have faith in my fellow Americans who recognize phony showmanship -- in preparation for 2020 -- by Democrats, i.e., Corey Booker -- who tried, but failed to unnerve Brett Kavanaugh -- the best man.  Excellent choice, Mr. President.
@JesseBWatters Thank you for pointing out that Colin Kaepernick was kind of a "has been" when he took his 1st knee. Like Rosie O'Donnell and Kathy Griffin.  Getting attention for being fashionably anti-Trump.  Most of us 49er fans knew Colin was never a "big whoop."
bono  Thinking all good thoughts and hopes here in Novato, California.  You're the best!
@rachelHundley_ The best of luck in November!  Good wishes and respect from Novato 👍
@amazon Home delivery is always perfect.  I am a senior citizen who is mildly disabled.  Amazon Prime has been a shopping aid for those days I couldn't make it to the supermarket.This is a giant THANK YOU to everyone from customer service, sellers, &amp; your great delivery people!
@innoutburger Your Novato franchise will NEVER go out of business.  It is the BEST.  Your politics is of no concern to me. THIS IS A FREE COUNTRY!
@realDonaldTrump Thank you for the great numbers in the Dow Jones and S&amp;P, too!  You are doing what you promised to do. Never forget that we senior citizens are among your most ardent and appreciative of admirers.  We understand the history  you're making.  MAGA and we love our country, too.
@realDonaldTrump Will be working at polls again in November. Hope to return home in the evening to good news a la 2016. California is a funny duck, but we understand good business sense here in Marin County. Senior citizens are 100% behind you. We love the cut of your jib.
@AnnCoulter Wonderful to see you on Watter's World. Re Hillary losing. I turned Libertarian because of her I'm a senior citizen who knows she didn't need any help to lose. Arkansas: 60% Trump vs 30% Clinton (former 1st Lady of AR). Much respect from Novato, CA  Russians? Nyet.
@LondonBreed Read about the Poop Patrol online.  How much would it cost for Porta-Potties on every block in the affected areas? Or employing the homeless and enlisting their help aa a benefit $$$$$ to them and the City?  You're doing a great job.  God bless you, Mayor Breed.
@realDonaldTrump Stay strong, Mr. President!  I can that many, many senior citizens (I am one) see things your way.  Fake News, yes. What does the mainstream media think we are?  Idiots who can be easily led because they say so.  We say "No way!  You're doing a fantastic job!
@realDonaldTrump Wonderful rally in West Virginia!  I'm a California native and still live here.  We so often forget there are 49 other states (and Puerto Rico and Guam) that make up our precious country.  Thank you for remembering those wonderful West Virginians.  Great rally.
@realDonaldTrump Congratulations on the longest bull run.  Just watching Neil Cavuto.  You know, many if not most of us seniors watch Fox News.  Tired of the National Enquirer style of mainstream media.  We want news and information.  Thank you, President Trump from Novato, CA!!!
@jamesoliphant This San Franciscan (born and raised in SF) living in Marin is watching the rally in West Virginia.  Beautiful state, great people, great President Trump.  This is the USA I remember.  Want to go to WVa
@realDonaldTrump Truly enjoyed your press conference today.  Never understand the anti-Border Control people -- wall or ICE officers.  YouTube carries UK Border showing the UK airport ICE agents at work.  Maybe we need a TV show showing our ICE agents and what they're up against.
@RealCandaceO Saw you with Maria B. You're so right. Old-timers (I'm 65 ) knew Trump was way ahead in social media in 2016.  I'm from San Francisco and have dumped my Democratic affiliation. My late immigrant mother's party has turned into a bunch of PC thugs. Trump in 2020!
@realDonaldTrump What possessed Andrew Cuomo to make the statement about America not ever having been that great?  My late mother was an immigrant (naturalized in 1958). Her feeling: America is the greatest country there ever was or ever will be.  Thank you President Trump MAGA!
@realDonaldTrump You are doing a fantastic job!  Two of my friends at the senior center are Korean War vets. My late Dad served in Korea. I can't imagine life without knowing the fate of a loved one in war. I thank you and Vice President Pence for remembering our vets everyday!
@DiamondandSilk I'm 65 and I love the both of you to bits.  You're asking the questions most of us would like to ask.  The two of you and Trey Gowdy rock my world.  Oh, and oh yes.  Wonderful President Trump!
@DiamondandSilk I'm a 65 year old Eurasian. Mom was a naturalized citizen from Japan. Why is it that the media never asks new naturalized citizens what they think of DACA and Express Lane citizenship for "refugees" from the Middle East?  Interviewees are always white women.
@DiamondandSilk I'm a BIG FAN of yours.The clarity of your thinking astounds me in this age of PC drivel and anti-Trump hate speech. Up until the 2016 election, I was a Democrat.  I live in Marin County, CA and something tells me there are more and more converts because of you!
@realDonaldTrump Russian collusion issue is $busy-work$ for lawyers.  Nothing sinister about the results of 2016 election.  If there had been Arkansans (in Hillary and Bill's old home) would have kicked up a fuss.  You won, President Trump fair &amp; square.  Trump 60% Clinton 30%.
@realDonaldTrump Congratulations to First Lady Melania's mother and father on becoming US citizens.  My late mother, Saeko Hicks, from Osaka, Japan became a citizen 62 years ago.  It was the proudest day of her life.
@Troy_Balderson I am keeping my fingers and toes crossed for you out  here in Novato, California,  Good luck always!
@realDonaldTrump I and my fellow ober-65 buddies here in Novato, CA  have decided that Balderson will win.  One of my pals is a fellow San Franciscan.  We both grew up in the same SF neighborhood near the Presidio. We consider Pelosi a carpetbagger from Baltimore who doesn't love our country.
@Troy_Balderson Good luck from Novato, California Troy Balderson.  Every best wish from our family to yours for every happiness and the best future.
@realDonaldTrump Democrats are a one-trick pony -- hating you. I grew up in San Francisco with (R) Mayor Christopher. People in those days had RECIPROCAL respect. Fox is my network because I like hearing people speak in complete sentences, not single syllables.Thank you, Mr. T!
@realDonaldTrump Everything you do gives me hope that this country will be great again.  Keep on keeping on. President Trump, you are a clear thinker and a direct speaker just like the people I grew up with in the 1950s. You are a big breath of clean, fresh non-PC air! Thank you, Mr. President.
@TuckerCarlson  Everybody it seemed was acting "out to lunch."  My fellow Democrats nominated Hillary Clinton as their candidate.  I thought "no" and turned Libertarian in 2016. Dems now want to convince everyone that Trump is off his rocker. I now know  Trump will win in 2020.
@PressSec The American Public has made up its mind about the media. Fox is at the top of the heap along with PBS &amp; the BBC. Objective news from the mainstream media? Everyday is 24/7 National Enquirer gossip told in endless hyperbole and exclamation points.We, the people, know.
@DavisSuedavis19 In San Rafael, California -- north of my hometown San Francisco -- Tommy has dozens of fans who've been following him on YouTube. He's world famous.  Saw him tonight on Fox with Sean Hannity. Hope he says strong and safe.  Like me, many of his fans are 65+ US Grannies love him!
@RandPitt I'm a senior citizen.  Would you mind translating that into Japanese?
@PergeoGermany Hillary even lost in Arkansas where she was First Lady for 12 years. 30% for Hillary and 60% for Trump. The witch hunt is futile and screwy.  She was a lousy candidate that nobody liked who ran a lousy ground game. Thanks for the chance to sign the petition.
Hillary even lost in Arkansas where she was First Lady for 12 years.  30% for Hillary and 60% for Trump.  The witch hunt (and I'll sign the petition) is screwy.  She was a lousy candidate that nobody liked who ran a lousy ground game. Thanks for the chance to sign the petition.
@realDonaldTrump Love the Wilkes-Barre rally. Loved the Korean War vet sitting behind you. Dad was in both WWII and Korea (Sixth Army). So many senior citizens and vets.  I'm a senior citizen now (65) and know you have an ever-growing fan base!  Thank you always, Mr. President!
@PressSec Great job this morning, Sarah!  Thank you for standing fast.  You have quite a fan club out here.  You're the best Press Secretary this country has ever known.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!
@realDonaldTrump There's a reason why Fox Network has the highest ratings.  Because we senior citizens watch it day and night.  Also, we know when we're being manipulated by slanted, non-objective nonsense.  Remember when news was supposed to be objective?  You and Fox rule!
@realDonaldTrump We're 100% behind you.  China:  They need us more than we need them.  Muller probe?  In a word:  Fishy.  I and my fellow senior citizen friends know we're not alone when we say we're so grateful to have you n the White House.  Keep the faith, Mr. President!
@PressSec You're probably growing weary of accepting adulation and compliments, but here's one more from a senior citizen in the San Francisco Bay Area.  How you're able to maintain your calm and equanimity at press conferences is beyond me. You never miss a beat.  You sparkle!
@realDonaldTrump Just had my coffee with my fellow seniors who agree you're the best thing to happen to this country in decades. We can't wait until November when the Republicans will make a huge dent thanks to you. Also, you're a king-sized breath of fresh air, too. Thank you!
@EricTrump @realDonaldTrump @Acosta It was the most refreshing thing to see.  The American voter, especially we senior citizens, know quality when we see it.  President Trump will win  in 2020.  Credit "old timers" like me who hate bullies, but love the big breath of fresh air your father has brought to America!
@realDonaldTrump Today's Florida rally was great! Fox News is most trusted and most watched TV news source. Why? Because they report news clearly and accurately, the way CNN never will. We senior citizens have heard it all before.  The left's hate campaign will backfire in 2020.
@realDonaldTrump Your strong stance on the wall was welcome news.  Please point out to your detractors that we don't want a Calais Jungle happening here.  God bless you, President Trump.
@realDonaldTrump Please continue STRONG stance on the wall, chain migration and "catch and release." National security is of paramount importance.  We already know what is happening in the UK &amp; EU due to their soft borders. You can prevent that chaos from happening here.
@realDonaldTrump We senior citizens appreciate you. You're taking care of vets and the the people who work in our factories and farms.  Strong points people overlook is you cannot be bullied or bought.  We see Fox News and we always give a  big fist pump in your honor. Thank you.
@realDonaldTrump 4.1 GDP!  Thank you very much, President Trump.  You are both a breath of fresh air and a big breath of vitality and $$$$$ into our economy.  Stay strong and keep on keeping on.  I'm a senior citizen who knows a bunch of other senior citizens who love you!
@realDonaldTrump Re the Hillary Hack: Maybe the truth is simple. She just wasn't popular enough. In the state of Arkansas where she was First Lady for 12 years the 2016 results for the state of AR was 60% Trump and 30% Clinton.I'm so glad YOU are there and have a great weekend!
@realDonaldTrump   If Obama suspected  Putin of pending meddling, why didn't he do something while he was POTUS?  The US has  a glut of cyber experts and whistleblowers..  Why didn't he hire a few to detect and counter the Russians.  Maybe they weren't there?  Just thinking.
@realDonaldTrump Thank you for always remembering everyone.  Senior citizens love you especially this one.  You're doing a fantastic job!
@POTUS Great Granite City speech.  Another one hit out of the park!  Thank you, Mr. President.
@PutinRF_Eng Thank you for being a friend to the USA.  The future will bring all good things to us in the US and Russia.  I'm just a senior citizen and I'm happy to see the 21st century shed a new bright light on relations between our two countries.  Happiness always, Mr. Putin!
@POTUS Our group of seniors applaud you.  National Security is #1 on our list and we're  glad to see it on yours.  My friend Ramona is both a Gold Star Mom &amp;  a retired WAC.  Our town, Novato, CA is home to many seniors and vets.  We are behind you all the way, Mr. President!
Petition To Demand An END To The Witch Hunt Against President Trump: https://t.co/aG5X95lFuE
@realDonaldTrump I know, President Trump, you have a sturdy base of supporters in us senior citizens.  You love our wonderful country and we know it.  Please make visits in your 2020 campaign to senior living facilities, clubs and homes. MAGA! It is happening now thanks to you.
@realDonaldTrump Thank you, President Trump for having Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State.  A thinker who knows how to dominate and control a hearing  just like a stern parent. My son, who was JrROTC in high school (now 35) extolled Mike Pompeo from the beginning: "Rock solid."
@realDonaldTrump Thank you for meeting and greeting Sgt. Allen Jones. We all fell in love with him.  I have no doubt he will be celebrating his next birthday with you.  God bless you both.
@SarahHuckabee Please don't go.  In my 65 years, I've never been as impressed or as riveted by a White House Press Secretary as I have been with you.  Your clarity and calm demeanor are what the American public "give a damn" about what you have to say.  Please, oh please stay.
@greggutfeld Senior citizen social media?  YouTube.  Yes, I know.  My son says "full of trolls."  I tell him we (over 65's like me) called Trump's win in 2016 and we say Trump will win in 2020). Schumer, Pelosi and Waters won't shut up = Trump Victory in 2020!. YT keeps score.
@realDonaldTrump Thank you very much, President Trump for meeting with the veterans in Kansas City My father served in the US Sixth Army in San Francisco.  He died on active duty in 1956.  He is buried at the Presidio along with my mother.  I thank you in their memory and honor.
@realDonaldTrump "In May 2018 President Trump donated one-fourth of his $400,000-per-year salary to the Department of Veterans Affairs." Snopes confirmed it.  Thank you, Mr. President from A Former Army Brat
@realDonaldTrump We trust you, Mr. President.  Democrats are looking shabbier and more untrustworthy by the day.  I look forward to calling you "Mr. President" in 2020.  Good luck and godspeed in everything that you have to do in these upcoming days.  From A Former Democrat
@GovMikeHuckabee Saw you on the Levin Show on Fox.  You were terrific.  I'm a senior citizen who is very reassured knowing that in the midst of this havoc two cool heads -- your daughter and President Trump -- are ready to weather the storm.  Seniors will see him win in 2020!
@realDonaldTrump We trust you!  I and my fellow over 65's are sick to death of this felonious anti-Trump bias.  Regardless of where we are -- I'm in Novato, California -- senior citizens, like me, are just ignoring the nonsense and the noise.  Trump in 2020!  We trust you!
@greggutfeld Thanks for your normalcy.  I'm from SF and live in Novato.  I tell all my fellow senior citizens who are not from the Bay Area that Greg Gutfeld is from San Mateo and all his bolts are still tight.  They all love you. Trump will win in 2020.  	Over 65s on a Mission
@realDonaldTrump My fellow senior citizen friends who watch The View always wonder:  This is a TV show with a lot of money and staff.  Where is the footage that shows you, Mr. President, being or sounding like a racist?  They're ALL TALK and we know it.  Trump in 2020!
@realDonaldTrump Travel ban? In England, RAF Sgt Mark Prendeville was removed from a Royal Hospital waiting room.His uniform might "upset" some people and they had "many different cultures coming through." A ban does not make you a racist, Mr. Trump. My British in-laws love you.
@realDonaldTrump The voters who'll carry you in 2020 are people like me -- SENIOR CITIZENS. Democrats have become a pack of patronizing bullies.  I know another group behind:  VETERANS.  Two vets I know I see @ McD's daily.  We love you and we TRUST YOU. Thank you, Mr. President!
@realDonaldTrump Just finished a survey e-mailed by your office re the mainstream media.  Sorry I couldn't donate $.  I'm on Social Security.  No leeway but I'll ask my son to donate for me. I liken your presidency to Amazon:  5-star products, delivery and customer service.
@TGowdySC  You  make me want to move to South Carolina.  I'm an over-65 fan in Novato,  CA  Re the Russians:  Were they even needed to goof things up?   Hillary only took 30% of the vote in Arkansas. 3 terms for Bill as  governor and her as First Lady?  You're terrific BTW.
@TGowdySC You make me want to move to South Carolina.  I'm an over-65 fan in Novato, California.  Re the Russians:  Were they even needed to goof things up?  Hillary only took 30% of the vote in Arkansas. 3 terms for Bill as governor and her as First Lady?  You're terrific BTW.
@rushlimbaugh Clinton lost because she was a lousy candidate. Arkansas results:  60% Trump; 30% Clinton.  Didn't she used to be First Lady of Arkansas and didn't Bill have 3 terms there as governor?  Why is everyone ignoring the obvious?  Signed:  Russian Meddling My Foot
@PutinRF_Eng I'm a 65 year old who admires both you and President Trump and wants to thank you for your cooperative spirit and trust.  Russian meddling.  Unlikely because it was unnecessary.  Arkansas election results:  Trump 60% and Clinton 30% Hillary used to be AR's First Lady
@PressSec You're doing a terrific job.  I'm a senior citizen in Novato, California who's puzzled.  Former Arkansas First Lady Hillary Clinton lost in AR badly 30% in comparison to Trump's taking 60%. Russian meddling?  Give me a break.  BTW seniors  love you and President Trump.
@greggutfeld I'm a native San Franciscan.  Where did all the people with common sense go?  Hillary couldn't even carry the state of Arkansas where Bill was governor for 3 terms.  30% Clinton and 60% Trump.  Enough with the Russian meddling already!
@JudgeJeanine I'm a 65 year old Bay Area resident.  SF native. When will Democrats learn they are turning a lot of people off withe their National Enquirer news and lynch mob mentality.  Hillary Clinton couldn't even carry the state of AR where Bill was governor for 3 terms.
@TuckerCarlson As a San Franciscan who lives in Novato now, I beg you to bring up the fact that former First Lady of Arkansas only got 30% of AR votes while Trump took 60%.  Does Fox think that this is insignificant?  Old ladies in Novato don't think so!  You're terrific BTW.
@seanhannity Former First Lady of Arkansas only got 30% of votes in AR while Trump commanded 60%.  I'm sitting here in Marin County, CA waiting for someone to bring that up.  Russian meddling, my foot.  A lot of us senior citizens will vote Trump in 2020.  He's our man!
@GovMikeHuckabee Saw you on Fox this morning. Great comments. Please remind people that Clinton only took 30% of the votes in Arkansas while Trump commanded 60% in the presidential election.  I'm sitting out here in the  SF Bay Area (pro-Trump) thinking Russian collusion? No way!
@realDonaldTrump Spent part of my afternoon having coffee with a friend (over 65).  Mr. President you need not worry,  I'm in Novato, California where many seniors I know love you. We're tired of all the alarmist crap coming from the Democrats. You're "it" in 2020!  Rock on!
@JeffBezos Senior citizens — homebound  and not homebound.  This past year I’ve been temporarily disabled.  Amazon Prime has been a godsend.  My idea:  Senior discounts for Prime.  Unpacking help for seniors.  Thank you for asking.
@realDonaldTrump What was it Bill Bennett called it today?  The "lynch mob mentality" of the Democrats?  I'm glad I quit them. One word for you, Mr. President:  "Gambatte."  In Japanese it means don't give up, stay strong, and keep going all rolled up in one. You're the best.
@realDonaldTrump 2016 Election results  State of Arkansas, where you President Trump commanded 60% of the vote and Hillary Clinton only took 30%  I don't think this hints at Russian collusion.  What it hints at is that she was a lousy candidate who ran a lousy campaign. Agreed?
@realDonaldTrump Worked at the polls in June. Don't forget us senior citizens.  I worked at the polls earlier this year in Novato, CA, my home.  Although I don't know how anyone voted, I can tell you we (over 65s) were there in big numbers! I also know: seniors love you!
@realDonaldTrump Democrats truly showed themselves to be the hypocritical bullies that they are.  Every time I see that kind of behavior from them I say to my son, "Trump in 2020.  No problem."  Youre going to get tons of support from people like me -- senior citizens.  Trust me.
@seanhannity If I had to describe what I thought of Strzok's testimony, I'd call it furtive or big time CYA yadda-yadda.  As many of us senior citizens thought while we were watching this man, "He's not even a good liar. But, he is a liar." How did he fool so many people?
@seanhannity @LyndaMick I have in-laws in Britain -- Milton Keynes, Birmingham, Liverpool.  I live in Novato, California.  President Trump has no popularity problems among them. I lived in Liverpool in the 1970s. If MSM were to interview regular folk in those cities, you'd probably find  fan clubs.
@seanhannity Trump won Arkansas by commanding 60% of the votes.  Hillary only took 30%.  Former First Lady of Arkansas's results speak for itself.  Collusion?  Get real.
@seanhannity  I'm a senior citizen who wonders where all the sensible people went.  I'm a 65 year old Eurasian female who grew up in San Francisco. My Japanese mother was very proud to cast her first vote as a Democrat. Today's Democratic leaders would grieve her beyond words.
@realDonaldTrump Just saw Hillary Clinton's comment about today.  Does anyone ever point out to her that she only scored 30% of the votes from the state of Arkansas where she was once the Gubernatorial First Lady while you commanded 60%.  Collusion, my foot!
@realDonaldTrump Did the Russians sneak one past us? Improbable.   If we have an intelligence department and President Obama suspected collusion, what was everyone doing the year prior to the 2016 election?  No collusion. I'm glad you stuck by your guns today, Mr. President.
@realDonaldTrump I've always say that  the best thing the voters of the United States could do is to put an entrepreneur, a business executive in the White House.  And that they've done.  Our country will only gain from your presidency, President Trump.  My thanks to you!
@DiamondandSilk Love that lovely photo of you, Diamond &amp; Silk with our great President Trump.  This 65 year old retiree and reformed Democrat think you three are three gargantuan breaths of fresh air!  Thank you all for loving and respecting our country.  We need you all now more than ever.
@DiamondandSilk "Agree to disagree." As you said the people in our wonderful country have lost the talent to do just that.  I grew up a Democrat with a mother from Japan who was proud to vote as a Democrat.  If she were alive today, she'd be holding her nose 24/7.  Love you two!
@realDonaldTrump Re Cyber-tampering. This country has more than enough hackers &amp; whistleblowers to last until the end of time. Where were they along with was President Obama and his suspicions?  I think this voter-tampering &amp; Russian hacking is just an excuse for Hillary's loss.
@blackdem313 @realDonaldTrump I would suspect hat Melania followed all the rules and obeyed the laws just like my Mom did in 1958 to become a naturalized US citizen from Japan.  Mom, however, was only bilingual.  Melania, I hear, speaks 5 languages.  Not bad.
@TrumpTromper @realDonaldTrump I'm just a 65 year old who grew up in 1950s San Francisco where I was taught by "old school" teachers that it was OK to have a differing opinion as long as it was an honest opinion. No drugs.  Just an old Eurasian lady.
@RudyGiuliani Strzok’s testimony was furtive in the worst way for him.	The hearings yesterday also showed me (I’m 65) how Democrats have become nothing more than a pack of lying, posturing, bullying thugs.  Trump in 2020!
@realDonaldTrump Queen Elizabeth II is an idol of mine. Her strength during the worst of times is always admirable.  Enjoy your meeting with her.  Thanks to you  &amp; Melania for representing the USA with your heartfelt pride and endless class. All of us thank you in the UK &amp; USA!
@realDonaldTrump My relatives in Milton Keynes, Liverpool and Birmingham wish you the best.  I live in Novato, California. If only the American press would go to the Midlands and Northwest, then they'd get the real scoop about how many UK people feel about you.  All positive!
@bbelt9 Good luck, Brandon, from our family in Novato.  We're voting up a storm for you tonight!
@realDonaldTrump Enjoy your trip to the UK.  Don't let anyone tell you that the US or you are not popular. My in-laws in England (Milton Keynes, Birmingham and Liverpool) have nothing but respect for you and yhe First Lady.  Have a fantastic time!
@realDonaldTrump Yes.  "Come legally."  That is the answer.  Go to any naturalization ceremony (in San Francisco at the Masonic Auditorium) and talk to the people who got in line and followed the rules and the law and are now naturalized US citizens. My late mother did in 1958.
@realDonaldTrump Brett Kavanaugh is a great choice.  Thank you, Mr. President for looking out for our beloved, special country.  I'm a Libertarian but I find things about your presidency to cheer about everyday.  Sean Hannity's words after Judge Kavanaugh's speech was stirring.  Bravo, Mr. Trump!
@realDonaldTrump Each and every morning I get up thinking that you are exactly what this country needed.  Standing pat and firm on national security.  It's not an easy thing to do, but the alternative is open borders and chaos.  Thank God for you, Mr. President!
@realDonaldTrump In 2020 for the RNC convention, please find the African American in the Trump t-shirt and hat who appears In YouTube video "What L.A.Residents Really Think of L.A. as a Sanctuary City"-- Town Hall" posted by Shiela Allen.  Great, great, great!
@realDonaldTrump  Lupe Moreno on YouTube has one of the most powerful  speeches against sanctuary cities I've ever heard.  Why hasn't she been  interviewed by our mainstream media.? : THIS IS THE MOST POWERFUL ARGUMENT I HAVE HEARD AGAINST SANCTUARY CITIES IN AMERICA
@realDonaldTrump Happy 4th of July, Mr. President!  Lots of love to the First Lady, Melania.
@realDonaldTrump Elizabeth Warren!  Every time she's on KTVU News (Oakland-SF) and has anything to say about your policies, she must win a ton of votes for you. Is this the best Democrats can do?  I'm a Libertarian  and think, you're a cinch to win in 2020.  My vote is  yours.
@realDonaldTrump Laughing stock of the world?  Hardly.  President Trump, my in-laws in England -- Milton Keynes, Birmingham, Liverpool -- become bigger fans of yours every day. I don't have to tell you what I and other seniors like me think of you.  Keep up the great work!
@realDonaldTrump As the 65 year old daughter of a US serviceman and a naturalized citizen, I would , for once, love to hear  someone from the media go down to the Masonic Auditorium (SF) when new US citizens are being sworn in and ask one  what they think of US immigration laws.
@realDonaldTrump Thank you so much, President Trump for making sure that the people of Puerto Rico are provided with the safe havens and care they deserve.  I've never been to Puerto Rico and I know no one from PR.  The island, thank God, is within your reach and our aid!
@realDonaldTrump Ban Chain Migration.  As the daughter of a naturalized citizen  I never see anybody interviewed on TV on the matter who isn't white and upper middle class. All I have to say is "Dearborn, Michigan."  Calamity.  Must stop.  Keep up the great work, Mr. President!
@realDonaldTrump Travel Ban and Chain Migration are two sore spots with me.  Banning both make nothing but sense.  Please do what you can.  There are plenty of people like myself, children (I'm 65) of natiuralized citizens who obeyed the laws, waited their turn and got in line.
@realDonaldTrump Heard about the aid getting through to the people of Puerto Rico -- our fellow Ameircans.  So happy to hear about that.  Thank you, President Trump!
@realDonaldTrump You at you have a big fan base among us senior citizens.  In 1975 I lived in Southport, England.  Senior citizens paid zero on buses. In 2018, they still don't. Could you create a financial incentive for bus companies to do the same here?  Thank you, Mr. Trump!
@JalynneC35 @SFGiants @bcraw35 Wonderful photo!  Beautiful family!  Kindest wishes from Novato, California.  See you at the All Star Game, Brandon.  Our family votes are in.
@TheMaltbieBunch @SFGiants Gorgeous!  Kindest wishes from our family -- fellow Giants fans -- in Novato, California.
@realDonaldTrump You're doing a great job.  I, like many others, dismiss your critics as easily as they dismiss all the good you're doing. I'm a Libertarian who has no connection to Puerto Rico, but I pray for those citizens every day  Please help our citizens in Puerto Rico.
@realDonaldTrump Tonight's speech in North Dakota was outstanding.  Ever since my Mom (a naturalized citizen from Japan) passed away in 2005, I've made it a point to work at the polls in her honor.  President Trump, you have a way of making people turn out for elections.
@realDonaldTrump I have in-laws in England -- Milton Keynes, Birmingham and Liverpool.  They do not think you or our country is the laughing stock of the world.  They see what's happening in their country with out-of-control immigration. Thank you for protecting us, Mr. President
@realDonaldTrump Switzerland, Italy and Greece are beginning to deport large numbers of Muslim and African migrants.  Shouldn't you start publicly noting that all is not well in the EU &amp; UK?  Thank you for your travel ban. Sensible. Signed the daughter of a naturalized US citizen
@realDonaldTrump Not fake so much as heavily edited news.  I'm 65 and only listen to radio news KCBS (San Francisco) to find out weather, Giants scores and the time.  "News" stories sound like they were written by National Enquirer cub reporters.  I go to the online Christian Science Monitor.
@realDonaldTrump US media is in denial about the EU/UK migrant problem.  Unless people have relatives in UK or EU countries, Americans downplay reality. I have in-laws in Birmingham, Liverpool &amp; Milton Keynes. No riots, but there is trouble.  Thank you for trying to help the USA
President Trump, Good morning and thank you for finally mentioning what's happening in the EU.  Also, please let my fellow Americans know about the havoc created by "refugees" in the UK.  I'm an US citizen who has family there.
