All of this *could* eventually put pressure on cong'l Dems to re-impose the tax penalty that was the linchpin of Obamacare's constitutionality under the Supreme Court's 2012 ruling. If Dems re-impose tax, Republicans will run against them for raising taxes. And on and on it goes.

Closing Argument: 		@RepBuddyCarter says he wants to carry GA-01 values back to DC, asks for another term in Congress.		@LisaRingGA01 calls for universal health care, standing up for vets, a living wage, no off-shore drilling. Says she knows the hardships people have lived.
Do you support a path to citizenship for Dreamers? 		@LisaRingGA01: "Absolutely. I have friends who are Dreamers..."		@RepBuddyCarter: Says the first thing we must do is secure the border. Says he is not going to support amnesty or anyone cutting line, i.e., "no" on Dreamers.
Without mentioning Trump by name, @LisaRingGA01 says we must not allow conversation that disparages women.		@RepBuddyCarter says there is discrimination against women - but not from him. Says he respects his wife.
on family separations, @LisaRingGA01 says we should never have taken children away from their parent. Says there should be no delay. Says this is a human rights violation that we must remedy immediately.
Do you have a gay child or friend and what have you learned from them? 		@LisaRingGA01: No child but says gay friends tell her they are very concerned about what is happening in US and in Georgia.		@RepBuddyCarter: "I don't know. And I really don't care. I still love them."
Asked about the Infant and Maternal Mortality Rate, @LisaRingGA01 says "if we do not expand Medicaid, we are allowing many rural areas to go without health care." #GApol
State Level Non-partisan Redistricting Commissions		@LisaRingGA01: "I absolutely support a non-partisan or bipartisan commission on redistricting." 		@RepBuddyCarter: "No, I do not believe we have had gerrymandering in the state of Georgia," prompting audience members to guffaw.
Privatization:		@RepBuddyCarter: "Yes, I am in favor of it. We do have to have competition."		@LisaRingGA01 slams the 'disturbing trend' to privatize everything from the VA to prisons.  		#GApol
Trump Tariffs 		@LisaRingGA01: "to have irresponsibly put tariffs on hundreds of products is greatly impacting this district."		@RepBuddyCarter: says he would have been "more surgical" than Trump with his tariffs but says: "I applaud the president and what he is trying to do..."
Do the Trump tax cuts benefit the wealthy? 		@RepBuddyCarter touts the Trump tax cut and says to credit Obama for the economy is "ludicrous"; "I can't go along with that."		@LisaRingGA01 says "we need a progressive tax system where people who make the most pay the most."
.@LisaRingGA01 hammers the Republican Congress for adding $2 trillion to our debt -- "you want to talk about entitlements? Giving money to corporations so they are making record profits on top of record profits? That's entitlements."
