@HillaryClinton needs to answer to the American people on emails, pay to play, and Libya #FollowTheMoney
Last night, @realDonaldTrump showed he's focused on what matters most: protecting Americans, &amp; America's interests &amp; security in the world.
On the other hand, we have a candidate committed to the same failed foreign policies of the last 8 years. To me the choice is clear. (2/2)
Last night, we saw a clear choice- on one hand we have a candidate who will rebuild the military &amp; return to "peace through strength." (1/2)
It's critical our country chooses a Commander-in-Chief who's committed to a strong defense &amp; a strong America https://t.co/CnkcMAf6uQ
A weak national #defense is more often an invitation to confrontation than an overture of peace. #MakeAmericaSafeAgain
When it comes to #foreignpolicy, our President must put U.S. interests 1st. @realDonaldTrump is the only candidate we can trust to do that.
We need a Commander-in-Chief who will put our troops first.That's why I support our nominee- RT if you do too. (3/3) https://t.co/UIPnORZ563
This Administration has not done enough to support, equip, and serve those who have served this nation. (2/3)
Standing behind our men and women in uniform is part of who we are as a country. (1/3)
Solid plan put forward by our nominee to reverse sequestration+ rebuild our military. We need Reagan's approach of "Peace through strength."
