And just this Tuesday, Kentuckians elected @RepLindaBelcher, and flipped yet another Republican-held seat from red to blue in a district that Trump won with 72% of the vote in 2016. She won with over 68% of the vote. This is the reddest district flipped this cycle.
Just last week @GoodforFlorida won House District 72, defeating the son of the GOP Congressman. In a massive blow to Florida Republicans, Good defeated Buchanan by seven points, claiming a larger victory than even Donald Trump, who won the district by  5 points.
Democrat Mike Revis flipped the Jefferson County House seat, defeating his R opponent by 3 points in a district that Trump won by 28 points. This is a referendum on their harmful agenda which prioritizes the wealthiest at the expense of hardworking families.
Democrats elected @PattyforSenate to the Wisconsin state Senate. This is a district that Rs have held for nearly two decades, Trump won by 17 points and Mitt Romney won the district in 2012. Even anti-labor &amp; anti-worker Gov Scott Walker said this flip was a “wake up call”.
In just the first two months of 2018, Democrats have made gains in the Wisconsin state Senate, held a Minnesota state Senate seat in a district Trump won, and flipped seats in the Missouri, Florida, and Kentucky state Houses.
You guys...		We’re winning! https://t.co/UVUHuGZMIg

After remaining shamefully silent time, and time, and time again in the face of Trump’s countless attacks on women, this baseless attack is the height of hypocrisy. TL;DR: You can't pretend it's sexism when you get called out for your administration’s lying.
This is the same organization that just happily funded the campaign of an accused child molester, backed a presidential candidate who bragged about grabbing women by the genitals, and has made rolling back women’s access to health care a central tenet of its agenda.
But unleashing this ridiculous attack within hours of revelations about their own administration’s efforts to allow health workers to refuse reproductive care to women is rich, even for the RNC.
Republicans like Ronna McDaniel have suggested @CoryBooker was sexist for doing his job at a Senate hearing. That’s a joke! The GOP pretending to be a champion for women is laughable any day of the week. #ThursdayThoughts
