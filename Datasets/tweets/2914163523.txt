While we will never agree on every issue, it is time for our nation to come together and recognize the bond we share as Americans. #SOTU #AmericaFirst
This year, .@POTUS and @GOP are focused on bipartisan solutions to rebuild America’s deteriorating infrastructure, lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs, and protect America’s national security.  #SOTU
.@POTUS and @GOP have offered compromise, but the other side needs to be willing to negotiate on issues such as immigration reform. #SOTU
Under .@POTUS, the United States has brought North Korea to the negotiating table, withdrawn the U.S. from the flawed Iran Deal, and told our NATO partners to pay their fair share. #SOTU
.@SpeakerPelosi’s idea of compromise is, give me everything I want and you get nothing, then I blame you for getting nothing done. #SOTU #KeepAmericaSafe
Meanwhile, .@SpeakerPelosi and @Democrats refuse to even negotiate. They are advocating for open borders and, last year, they tried to abolish ICE. Some even want to give illegal immigrants the right to vote. #SOTU #KeepAmericaSafe
.@realDonaldTrump and @GOP want to secure our southern border by investing in personnel, advanced technology, and physical barriers. #SOTU #KeepAmericaSafe
A migrant caravan of 2,000 people reached our border yesterday. It’s time for .@SpeakerPelosi and @Democrats to admit the truth that physical barriers will protect Americans. #SOTU #KeepAmericaSafe
We must build physical barriers to stop the flow of human trafficking, sex trafficking, drugs, and weapons from pouring into our communities. #SOTU #KeepAmericaSafe
During the past two years, House Republicans have focused on making our communities safer, passing legislation aimed at combating the opioid crisis and investing in new resources for mental health, training, and school safety programs. #SOTU
Under .@realDonaldTrump and @GOP, for the first time in 75 years, the United States is now a net exporter of oil. #EnergyIndependence #SOTU
The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits is at its lowest since 1969. #SOTU
In 2018, Georgia was ranked the #1 state to do business; marking the 5th time in a row for this ranking. #SOTU
Over the past 12 months, Georgia has added 113,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate fell by 0.9% #SOTU
Throughout 2018 Women’s unemployment rate reached a 65-year low; Veterans unemployment rate reached an 18-year low; and Youth unemployment rate reached a 48-year low. #SOTU
Since .@realDonaldTrump took office, more than 5.3 million jobs have been created, and we now even have record low unemployment rates for African-Americans, Asians, and Hispanics. #SOTU
...and appropriated funds to procure, replace, and upgrade platforms, weapons, and equipment to maintain military superiority. #SOTU
During the past two years .@realDonaldTrump and @GOP rebuilt our military force, adding 20,000 troops; gave our men and women in uniform the largest pay raise since 2010...
Under .@realDonaldTrump and @GOP’s leadership, the American economy has been unleashed like never before. We now have more open jobs than workers to fill those jobs. #SOTU

The problem at our southern border is a humanitarian one. A physical barrier, border patrol, and surveillance technology will significantly discourage migrants from making this dangerous, sometimes deadly journey. #BuildtheWall #AmericaFirst https://t.co/RuQKFonJ7F

You know what keeps us from a shutdown, @SenSchumer? Voting to support our troops rather than playing political games. #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/qPmcSnMKNi

With the goal of eliminating unnecessary regulations that stifle innovation and competition, HR 4607 is a bipartisan step in the right direction.
This bill requires regulators to tailor regulations that they find to be outdated, duplicative, unnecessary, or overly burdensome instead of only producing a report.
HR 4607 broadens the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 to other financial regulatory agencies to make it more effective and gives them the opportunity to tailor regulations rather than painting them with a broad brush.
@FinancialCmte Working across party lines, this bill will modernize, expand, and improve EGRPRA.
HR 4607 will ensure regulators do more than just 'check the box' when it comes to finding and reporting duplicative and damaging regulations. @FinancialCmte
I introduced H.R. 4607- the Comprehensive Regulatory Review Act with @RepJoshG  (D-NJ) and @RepSeanDuffy (R-WI): a bipartisan improvement of EGRPRA.

Now is the time to pass a #balancedbudget amendment. Thank you to @HouseJudiciary for giving me time to discuss my bill, #HJRes29. https://t.co/BdoXbcDiM5
My #balancedbudget amendment, #HJRes29, would force Congress to implement gradual cuts, over time, and reform costly government programs.
This year, we will bring to the floor a proposal that attempts to balance our budget within a ten-year window. #BalancedBudgetAmendment.  ⚖💰 https://t.co/Ri4BtYa7fQ
If you started a savings account with $17K at Jesus’ birth &amp; deposited $17K every minute - you still couldn't pay off the national #debt.

My #balancedbudgetamendment, #HJRes29, will balance the budget within a 10-year window -without major disruption of critical govt. services.
The #debt clock is racing toward $20 trillion at a pace of over $10,000 per second. This is unsustainable →We need to balance the #budget.

Arbitration awards average $5,400. In contrast, class-action settlements average $32. We need to roll back the #CFPB's ban on arbitration.
Americans are skeptical of the too-big-to-be-useful government. Rules and regs, such as the CFPB Arbitration Rule, are harmful to Americans.
The #CFPB’s decision to ban arbitration with preference to class-action lawsuits will harm consumers and businesses. #HJRES111

On this National Day of Prayer, join me in praying for our country.
Every American, regardless of their circumstances, must have the opportunity to achieve financial independence. #FinancialCHOICEAct
Dodd-Frank has made it harder for businesses to create good-paying jobs. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
The Financial CHOICE Act will amend and eliminate provisions that restrict financial opportunity and investment options for Americans.
The Financial CHOICE Act provides desperately needed regulatory relief for Main Street banks and credit unions. #MAGA
Even President Obama’s Small Business Administration director admitted Dodd-Frank’s regulations hurt small business lending.
Consumers must be vigorously protected not only from fraud and deception, but also from the loss of economic opportunity and freedom.#CHOICE
RT @FinancialCmte: FACT: The #CHOICEact imposes the toughest penalties in history to hold Wall Street accountable. https://t.co/qxzLiHssai…
Unlike big banks, community banks can’t afford the armies of lawyers and compliance officers it takes to sort through Dodd-Frank’s red tape.
Dodd-Frank didn’t end “too big to fail,” but it did create “too small to succeed.” #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
The Financial CHOICE provides small businesses, start-ups, and entrepreneurs greater freedom to innovate and grow. #MAGA
Dodd-Frank’s excessive regulatory complexity has produced a less resilient financial system and stifled economic growth.
Simplicity must replace complexity, because complexity can be gamed by the well-connected and abused by the Washington powerful.
The Financial CHOICE Act gives consumers more choices when it comes to credit, providing access to products and services they want and need.
There will be bankruptcy – not taxpayer-funded bailouts – for financial firms that fail. #FinancialCHOICEAct
Dodd-Frank encompassed “The most terrifying words in the English language are: I'm from the government and I'm here to help.” (Reagan)
Big government tried to step in and fix our financial problems, but only made it worse with Dodd-Frank.
The Financial CHOICE Act ends bank bailouts and "too big to fail" once and for all.
Hardworking taxpayers still remain on the hook for Wall Street risk-taking thanks to Dodd-Frank’s bailout fund.
The Dodd-Frank Act made big banks bigger and small banks fewer.

It was a great morning to visit the @WhiteHouse to discuss our ideas for making America great again! #MAGA https://t.co/uFBaKufUsI
When there’s less government, we can grow our economy and create jobs for Americans. We need to give the power back to the people.
The @federalreserve claims it’s accountable to Congress, but evades Congressional oversight and sidesteps transparency in its rulemaking.
Nearly 15 million Americans are still unemployed or underemployed almost eight years after the recession ended. #Lessgovernment #freemarket
The #GAO confirms that the @Federalreserve doesn’t always follow its own guidance and principles. We must keep them accountable to Americans
The lack of transparency at the @Federalreserve is growing. We need to limit government and grow our economy.
Since Dodd-Frank, the @Federalreserve has overstepped its authority and power beyond its original legislative authority.
Chair #Yellen will be testifying at the @FinancialCmte this morning. Tune in today at https://t.co/XBeWmF4fLN at 10 a.m.
Congrats to our @CongressionalAC winners, @KMHS_GA student Ryan Cobelli and @Wheeler_High student Arvin Poddar! https://t.co/wkEypUm5jm https://t.co/2sFqwl0rFj
While #DoddFrank has cost countless jobs, it has created at least one job market – regulatory compliance specialists. We can do better.
We must reverse the damaging policies of #DoddFrank. 7 years later, our nation still loses an avg of 1 community bank or credit union a day.
It's time to seize the day and unbridle our economy from overbearing regulations. Exclusive op-ed in @thehill: https://t.co/pBqjCwUawT

@BauervanStraten And far less freedom. We can achieve those things without giving up liberty.
What the founders envisioned was a federal government so small that you'd forget it existed unless we were invaded or at a post office.
Enhanced screening measures are not geared toward any race or religion, but toward nations known to train, harbor or fund terrorists.
Government allows people seeking liberty a place in our society, but its role is to protect our citizens and those visiting our nation.
The federal government has become too lax in protecting our borders. We must have proper vetting. Op-ed: https://t.co/FhEyh2YS9X

Is the executive order on immigration in order? Read my exclusive op-ed in the @MDJOnline: https://t.co/gI1KPdnfeD
It’s hard to fire unproductive employees from civil service jobs. The #MERITAct reins-in fraud, waste, and abuse. https://t.co/upAv9BBBIg
There’s an unaccountable fourth branch of government; the regulatory agencies. We need a pump, the #MERITAct, to drain the swamp.
There are some really good government employees out there.The #MERITAct is only an alternative way to get rid of unproductive employees.
People come to Washington to slay alligators, but we need to drain the swamp. #MERITAct
It takes a minimum of 300 days to get rid of a bad govt. employee. We need to change the culture &amp; put govt. in line with private business.
The MERIT Act is in the @GOPoversight Cmte. The support of @POTUS is key - this bill will give him the tools to start draining the swamp.
The MERIT Act doesn’t replace an existing system, but allows federal departments to remove bad employees with a 60 day appeal.@FreedomWorks

The @HouseScience will continue its oversight of FDIC’s failures to secure Americans’ sensitive information.
The @fdicgov hasn't safeguarded Americans' personal info from apparent foreign entities and their disgruntled employees. @HouseScience
I'm growing more concerned because FDIC officials do not have answers to most of the questions we're asking them in @housescience
The issue we're facing at the @fdicgov is data getting out. Is giving employees laptops a good idea to prevent more cyber security breaches?
It is Congress’ responsibility to shine a light on FDIC’s history of cybersecurity breaches. @HouseScience
We don't want to micromanage the @FDICgov - but we want to ensure they will not continue putting our citizens' safety and security at risk.
Right now in @HouseScience - I'm asking the @FDICgov questions about their numerous data breaches.
The FDIC has failed to carry out their mission “to maintain stability and public confidence in the nation's financial system.” @HouseScience

It's time to rein in the agencies and regulations that are strangling small America's businesses. #REINSAct #GA11
By 2014, the new regulations issued under President Obama filled 486,500 pages of the federal register. #REINSAct #GA11
Though estimates vary, 3,554 new regulations imposed on American businesses cost as much as $1.9 trillion last year alone. #REINSAct #GA11
The price businesses pay to comply with complicated regulations is around $1.86 trillion each year, according to a 2014 report from CEI.
