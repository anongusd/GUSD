@haley_kramer I feel shorts are to short when the pockets are longer than the shorts!!
@MarkMaddenX jack didn't win a major between 80-86, not saying tiger will do it but he had a lull, agree tiger will not tie jack
@stephenasmith is @RealSkipBayless alive, no Tebow tweets?
@bubbawatson Tim Tebow getting sifned
@bubbawatson they are wicker baskets
@markmaddenx or does he play shorthanded on the top line because he is too stubborn to break up14-87-9
@MarkMaddenX can bennet replace dupu on that top line?
@bubbawatson I am really thinking 2013 @merion, first place!
@bubbawatson 2007 tied for fifth #BubbaTrivia
@tynerboy good pt
@MarkMaddenX would you break up that top powerplay, they are horrendous.  #1991 #itsnotover
@tynerboy how come you don't visit me
@XMorningShow are ulf and kjell still available for some defense?
@Keegan_Bradley 1991 don't count your chickens, 1991 bruins up two, that's right they lost to the pens in the east finals!
@MarkMaddenX is jagr in your top ten of all time?
@nflnetwork @jharrison9292 you should spend a little more, didn't work out so well the last couple seasons
@JamieSimoni looks exactly like Matt
@XMorningShow when you play defensively sound and disciplined you don't hang your goalie out to dry, I know MAF let up some easy ones up
@haley_kramer awwwwwwww
RT @penguins: What do you think, #Pens fans? Lemieux-esque? Sidney Crosby, 2013: http://t.co/2vqLpIt6Pe Mario Lemieux, 1988: http://t.co/Ey‚Ä¶
@ThePoniExpress does anyone care?
@JoeStarkey1 so we bench letang and malkin for their horrible turnovers?  I agree two soft goals, but we have alot more problems then just29
@MarkMaddenX extremely frustrating he has kept is in this game
@kdpomp on that one
@KDPomp agree my bad
@KDPomp bad shot by iginla #fleurysfault
@KDPomp terrible powerplay #fleurysfault
@Ken_Laird he has played phenomenal tonight, kept us alive
@KDPomp #fleurysfault
@KDPomp are you starting the Landry jones petition?  #blamegoalieorQB
@KDPomp it was deflected, how about letang not pinching on a penalty kill.  You sound like a typical yinzer.  #blamegoalieorQB
@haley_kramer soon like 26 days
@haley_kramer it could have been more fun if you saw Sara, me and ummm oh yeah Jackson too!! http://t.co/UgbrKbRtUa
@MarkMaddenX asbestos is scary
@MarkMaddenX do you think Neal will play today?
@RobRossi_Trib do you think Neal will play today?
@Ken_Laird what has TK done this year to make you want to defend him.  Experience is one thing but what have you done for me lately?
@Ken_Laird about time Kennedy has been useless recently
@haley_kramer how is vball?
@haley_kramer how many more days of school
@haley_kramer http://t.co/7R8evrW9Vo
@JasonSobelGC what is the pin Jason day and angel Cabrera are wearing on their hats?
@Espngreeny viewers able to call in is ridiculous
@RickieFowlerPGA great round today keep it going!
@CDPetri_Esq thank you!!! I was going to give that a try, blow is a bitch and I can't kick it
@MarkMaddenX drunk tailgating outside Heinz field
@KDPomp Houston seems like the only team that could come close, saw some reports Ed Reed was visiting there
@Espngreeny as a steeler fan I am surprised he didn't drop the pen when signing the contract, def a good player but not worth that
@JasonSobelGC can you make sure his teeth are ok?
@CDPetri_Esq @jasonjaypetri are you sure it is not the gangsters of wake Forrest
@RickieFowlerPGA that is hilarious
@MarkMaddenX did you see the article on http://t.co/FQlAKIzEPA, Hines ward would have never let this happen.
@RealSkipBayless agree100%.  4 would have been better if he didn't jump on the airplane.  That part made 3 so better!!
@JasonSobelGC ridiculous CBS quit coverage for 60minutes
@EdBouchette do you see the steelers going after a running back via free agency.  No big name like Stephen Jackson but anyone else?
@eknbc I appreciate the Education today!  You seem to be all over it!!
@MarkMaddenX @penguinslive Marc Andre fleury's play.
@MarkMaddenX will he become alexi morozov? Do you think they should keep him with the baby pens?
@KDPomp two Norris trophy candidates out there w/ letang and karlsson.  Who would you rather have? If letang is healthy can he win it?
@CDPetri_Esq you mean bury your car in snow
@haley_kramer I wish, I may be able to Make it for breakfast, but make it for 7 you forgot @reillygirl11 and @jacksonthecutestboyyinzevaseen
@haley_kramer very jealous
@JasonSobelGC  what are your thoughts on Adam Scott this week?
@CDPetri_Esq What a bunch of assholes!! #wherewasraylewis
@XMorningShow Amos zereoue just fumbled in celebration over your tweet mention
@RobRossi_Trib Is it a sell out tonight?i imagine it is, but it seems quiet on tv!  #LetsGoPens
@RobRossi_Trib flat crowd for a flat team
@RobRossi_Trib terrible call!
@937theFan ill TiVo the pens game and drop the puck at 629 eastern time.
@Espngreeny take the safety?
@NHL y are you useless
@NHL thank you for canceling half the season!!!  Then I purchase the NHL package and you black out the penguin game
@haley_kramer brock
@RobRossi_Trib how much do we miss stahl on the pk this year?
@markschlereth what a Moooron
@Espngreeny was that the worst defensive play you have ever seen?
@markschlereth hiding would have been a better call
@Espngreeny is there MVP still the replacement refs?? Do they make the playoffs without that call?
@ReillyRick there were numerous drunk driving related deaths last night we need to get rid of these cars!
@MarkMaddenX did Ryan Clark get traded?  That's about the only reason he should insult Ben.  Glad to see he got his teammates back #idiocy
@haley_kramer ;)
@haley_kramer why do you shoot them and then stab the person?
@haley_kramer that awkward moment when your cousin is at a nice restaurant and her shirt is on inside out #embarassing http://t.co/guoWQPEz

@haley_kramer #jealous
@haley_kramer why are you up so early?
@XMorningShow if a guy goes to a knee for a "prayer celebration" after a td, should that be a penalty?
@MarkMaddenX 8-8
@MarkMaddenX we may be low class but don't put that evil of Emanuel Sanders on us
@Espngreeny I think Tom Brady was trying to get in your debate from yesterday
@tynerboy yeah, yeah, blame the sis!!
@tynerboy are you at the Christmas shop on Black Friday?  Big door busters?
