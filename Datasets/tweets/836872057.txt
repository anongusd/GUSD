@NoLongerIgnored Title IV-D is the government laws to govern the collection of funds (CS and SS) along with collection incentives for the states.  Enticement begets Lawlessness for these governments in the states.
@domesticshelter Most cases of "Toxic Divorce" leaves one or both parties bankrupt or worse, the Lawyers bank the spoils with some Judges getting in on the property sales as well... a scam that needs reform in all 50 states.

@nowhoppers @thechildrenare1 So you both in your "Professional" opinion believe all of PA is to what?  abuse the other parent?  Please clarify.  Sorry I haven't been on much I had a death in my family. and I have two hearings coming up I am prepping for.
@nowhoppers @thechildrenare1 My three children have been Alienated from me for 13 years.... Traumatized Parent? I don't think so...  I am the Alienated Parent.

@mommy4vic Good  They need you to stay strong.
@nowhoppers @thechildrenare1 She is one opinion with one case to her credit as being proven NOT PA as was claimed. As I stated, PA is like DV, it is real and is also abused by some in a Toxic Divorce situation. Making the "RULE" based on one opinion and your own issues is no good for anyone, real or fake.
@nowhoppers Unfortunately I personally am a victim of PA so please don't spout your personal theories or case issues this is not how it is with everyone else, all cases are different. PA is very much used as a tool within divorce, tons of research and cases, many writings, Bar training etc.
@nowhoppers We don't want Wife beaters to have anything to do with us at all.  We don't condone any type of DV including false claims as well as child abuse from either parent.
@JClinPsychiatry For the sake of REAL PA Victims and their Alienated parents Please do  not attempt to water down PA with PTSD or DTDs as BOTH are linked to great trauma such as war and DV witness this IS far from True PA. False  claims of any of these are just that, False. Dealt with separately.

@nowhoppers Understood, but that was that case try not to generalize ALL cases as like that one or your own... PA, DV, CS, Custody Children in general are ALL tools used by lawyers to create &amp; foster Toxic Divorce situations, The Lawyers &amp; system win $$$ &amp; the parents &amp; children get screwed

@madncmoms @families_f @Voiceless_child Understood and agreed... Abuse must Obviously be proven and recognized then 50/50 is out the window and off the table. Agreed. should be obvious but like you say rights are violated and proof is ignored based on $$ and crooked lawyers/judges/GAL etc.
@lhkwalter Fight for your rights with @FCLUORG
@madncmoms @families_f @Voiceless_child There is strength in numbers and then things can get done, we have affiliated groups from all over the country and we ALL are for a common cause.. end the corruption (male or female) we are a group that wants to become obsolete, we need to cooperate with each other &amp; other groups
@madncmoms @families_f @Voiceless_child Understood. That is the history that has been communicated to me and from what I have read also. Now Women are making money and the corruption has targeted them also. OUR POINT for this entire discussion is we help both sexes, we wish to unite with women's groups 4 more strength
@madncmoms @families_f @Voiceless_child We don't pick sides, we are not for you if you are just upset over not winning a verdict. We are a rights group, teaching you your rights and how to fight for them if they are violated. Historically, men where the first and most common victims of Family courts, now women are 2.
