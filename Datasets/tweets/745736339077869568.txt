@SusanKim4 @vincevitrano @BNiznanskyTMJ4 @tmj4 Thanks Susan... I most certainly will... You have a good day...
@johncardillo @USABookClub Apparently Elizabeth Warren says Trump may not be President, or free from incarceration, by the time 2020 rolls around... She's determined to find anything to help her chances of winning including removing him as a possible opponent... The cheaters way of winning...
first to show he's not playing with them anymore since they want to get all Stasi-like...
Pretty sad that since no Russian collusion has been found that Warren, Schiff, and Green all declare they are going to go after Trump for anything else they can muster up... Stalin would be proud of them... Show me a man and I'll find you a crime... Trump should go after them

@RobbieMoray @johncardillo If the POTUS can't perform the duties there's a way for them to step down/be removed and the same holds true for U.S.S.C. Justices who can't perform their duties. It's not just right wingers demanding hoops be jumped through to prove it's our Laws requiring it of Justices of S.C.

The same tactics were used for you [Obama] as for RBG... Meaning claims of witness sightings at events where no photos or video were allowed... Why not settle the question immediately to put any possibly inaccurate 'theories' to rest???
whats really going on…
