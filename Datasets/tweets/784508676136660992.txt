@Tony5RepsMn @GopherMBB Purdue scoring gave them a chance to set their D
@lilnitrovert2k @GopherMBB That really is a must win. Gophers are the better team especially at home
@FreeCousinEddie Yes in their ncaa run
@lilnitrovert2k @GopherMBB If they lose to Wisconsin st home I will agree they are like 45
@FreeCousinEddie Michigan was never a big lead
@Tony5RepsMn @GopherMBB No it‚Äôs missing those points and not being able to set up the defense. And then Purdue gets long rebounds that lead to points
@lilnitrovert2k @GopherMBB Just like Andy Katz
@lilnitrovert2k @GopherMBB After today I think they are top 20
@FreeCousinEddie Came down to a last shot against Michigan
@FreeCousinEddie Wisconsin ü§îWashington in Vancouver
@mostlyem @GopherMBB They are playing great now
@lilnitrovert2k @GopherMBB Gophers are a top 30 team
@lilnitrovert2k @GopherMBB LOL . OK
@FreeCousinEddie Winning at Purdue is almost impossible in recent years
@mostlyem @GopherMBB Wisconsin is ranked 11 in the NET. Gophers also beat Washington
@Tony5RepsMn @GopherMBB If you watched the game you would know it did
@lilnitrovert2k @GopherMBB Michigan and Purdue are top 10 teams. Ohio state was playing like a top 15 team. And Boston college was after playing 3 games in 4 days and traveling 3000 miles. Illinois is the only bad loss there
People seem to forget Purdue has a top 3 home court advantage in the country. https://t.co/FIQzM4rRU6
@Tony5RepsMn @GopherMBB Missed 2 front ends of 1 and 1s and long rebounds for Purdue. Otherwise Minnesota wins
