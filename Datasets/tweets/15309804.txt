@itschlot Our forecast is (and has been) for any accumulation mainly on grass... Roads should be fine for the most part
Snow potential index: 5/10 (↑) Decent chance of an inch or so of snow in parts of the DMV Sunday late afternoon into evening, even if it’s more on grass than anything else. https://t.co/VCyaFq383a
Sunday Digit: 2/10 - The morning’s not too bad, but the afternoon and evening sloppy mess is best enjoyed through the windows. -Brian, CWG https://t.co/VCyaFq383a

@bpm_dcwx when the prediction is t-1 or 1-2", mostly on grass...for the immediate area, the bust scenario of no accumulation or coating isn't that different... In other words, our most likely forecast is already reflecting climo, so we don't need to prop up the bust odds.
@bpm_dcwx Same crew- we lowered totals and booms by 1" in each zone, but left bust odds the same.
For those up late, we've lowered our snow forecast slightly for most areas as some models have gently shifted rain-snow line a bit north and raised temps a bit. This forecast is a moving target so we may tweak this one more time Sunday morning before the event starts. https://t.co/Xm7jn2cBSV
Evening hi rez model data suggested a small shift north and temperatures perhaps a degree warmer overall for Sunday snow threat. Accumulation forecast remains very tricky. 		Don't take the maps attached verbatim, but gives an idea of today's shifts. https://t.co/gOQ2tg85vy https://t.co/54giaBSxoc
Forecast for Sunday is TOUGH--- DC straddling rain/sleet/snow line. Conditions may vary considerably over small distances. It should turn snowier &amp; snowier as you head NW in area. Temps near 33/34 mean roads may stay mostly wet except in heavier bursts. https://t.co/octT7X6QZG
@Barra_Brava @thesoccerdon @AudiField @dcunited probably a mixed bag. sloppy, slushy. ugh.
@dougkammerer @bpm_dcwx @Luciano___98 Really hard forecast. Temps are an issue, precip type may change back and forth... Don't have a great feel for this one. A lot of ways for this bust but if the precip falls heavily, could get messy anywhere in the metro.
@KatieMalone78 We'd say 3-6 more likely, except near Pa line in northern part of county, where we could see 4-8.
@bpm_dcwx @Luciano___98 In hindsight, probably should've given bust higher odds. Fair point. But it's what we issued so we'll stick with it for now. We might tweak numbers after 0z runs if needed.
@Luciano___98 @bpm_dcwx Bear in mind, we think most accumulation within a country radius of DC will be on grass... the exception being higher elevations of northern Montgomery County.

@Trentons_dad1 Have a great day :)
@RavensNation101 Not out of the question. Will depend on where simulations end up with the rain-snow line. Right now, low confidence for Howard County for significant snow.
@Trentons_dad1 We have looked at the latest data, and there is no stance. We're leaning a certain way but our minds are open. We'll see how additional data yet to come in evolves and will then do our best to make a call.
Programming note: Still  a very close call for Sunday with rain-snow line setting up in our region. We lean toward sleet-snow mix to rain and low impact in immediate area due to temps above freezing. But we'll look at newest data and have update mid-to-late afternoon today.

@shawnmilrad That's fine. The views of numerous forecasters were included in story. It would have been not hard to find more. Is the issue I quoted broadcast mets on Twitter? Are they not competent? Do their views not matter? And - per other Tweet- forecasters in other sectors feel same.
@shawnmilrad Email just in from a forecaster who works in energy/ag field: "your article was very well-written and balanced in my view.  This model still has serious problems."
@shawnmilrad Cliff said he has been carefully tracking the model performance. Your personal opinions about him not germane here. Have both talked to forecasters about this and seen their reviews... the sentiment is all the same... they're very concerned.
@AliciaMBentley @crankywxguy Indeed, as we reported, GFS and GFS-FV3 both had best track forecasts for Florence: https://t.co/nniCX2tL3H		The FV3 snow/cold bias issues are still there in medium-range though.
@THE_Eric_Allen @DrShepherd2013 @ForbesScience Nws forecasters wouldn’t be allowed by public affairs to express concern about their own agency’s model on the record. The union reps might be an exception ... but not sure if they’re plugged into this. Thanks for the dialog.
@THE_Eric_Allen @DrShepherd2013 @ForbesScience Wasn’t trashing model. Was highlighting concerns forecasters and researchers have expressed before it becomes the operational and flagship model for the nation. Would apple knowingly role out an iPhone with a major bug that would affect key users?
@THE_Eric_Allen @DrShepherd2013 @ForbesScience Yes... the story did focus on what folks think are problematic because that’s the issue at hand right now. We have written several other stories on the fv3 and related issues which are positive.
@THE_Eric_Allen @DrShepherd2013 @ForbesScience The story wasn’t about the nuts and bolts of the model... it was about forecaster perception and there is a STRONG perception among users that there are issues.
@THE_Eric_Allen @DrShepherd2013 @ForbesScience The director NWS was quoted!
@THE_Eric_Allen @DrShepherd2013 @ForbesScience Wow...there are very knowledgeable, and experienced people - leaders in our field - who would felt the story was fair and spot on. Jason, CWG
@Thorcaster @shawnmilrad Thanks for weighing in. Fair point.
@THE_Eric_Allen Thanks. Some valid points here which am happy to use in future reporting. Stand by range of voices &amp; balance of my story, which included positive views on FV3. Reject view opinions of broadcast Mets don’t matter. Many are great forecasters &amp; reach more more people than anyone.
@past_is_future @NickLilja @shawnmilrad @tempestchasing All true except the very last part.
@shawnmilrad @tempestchasing Have tracked this issue for months and the overwhelming sentiment expressed by forecasters about this model for snow and cold in the medium range is distrust. Can’t see how you can dispute that.
@shawnmilrad Maybe because they’re accessible and respond immediately on deadline, they can explain things in plain English, and their views often mirror many others. That said happy to include other voices and I do. Substantively, did you disagree with what either said here? Jason, CWG

@dougkammerer @ryanhanrahan @mattlanza It actually makes me nervous as  forecaster... I have a feel for the current GFS and while it's not great, usually understand what it's doing. Have no feel for FV3 and don't trust it. While seems okay in short-range, worry about false alarms in medium-range. Jason
@ryanhanrahan @mattlanza Yeah... we should query this... Good suggestion.
@ryanhanrahan @mattlanza I just don't trust it. On several occasions its numbers for DC have been unrealistic. Jason, CWG
@ryanhanrahan @mattlanza (once the current version of the gfs is phased out)
@ryanhanrahan @mattlanza This is a serious issue, actually. It has been fools' gold on a number of occasions this winter and its forecasts not credible. So once it's phased out, we're left with one credible medium-range model (the Euro) for East Coast winter storms. A step backwards and not good.

@RogerPielkeJr It is not a stretch to say hurricanes that rapidly intensify are “worse”... Kossin’s and Maue’s statements in the story certainly support that idea.

The National Weather Service has issued winter weather advisory for DC-Balt region for a dusting to 2" of snow (highest amounts toward Baltimore) 6a to 3p Friday. Particular concern is Friday AM commute. Cold temps means everything sticks! More info: https://t.co/3BZdw0dYBi https://t.co/NDXzphxn2s
National Weather Service on Friday AM snow in DC + Balt: "If this threat does materialize during the Friday morning rush-hour, many untreated roads could quickly turn icy. This could lead to dangerous traveling conditions, multiple accidents, and extensive delays."
Intensity of any snow Friday morning should mostly be LIGHT. The problem is air and road temps are COLD. Every flake will stick on untreated surfaces. 7a temps will be in teens Friday. More info: https://t.co/3BZdw0dYBi https://t.co/Ts5MvEXrA4

This forecast is still subject to change so keep following our coverage for updates. We lay out all of our latest thinking and more at this link: https://t.co/fK6IFKziVT (8/8)
We do not think this will be like Commutageddon in Jan 2011 when we had 5-10" during PM commute or like the encore in Jan 2016 when roads temps were in 20s, hadn't been treated, and everything turned to ice. But do stay flexible w/ plans, telecommute or consider metro Tues. (7/x)
AFTER the snow ends, temperatures will really start to tank and wet/slushy untreated areas are likely to ice over. This animation suggests we go from wet/slushy to icy around 7 to 10p from west to east. (6/x) https://t.co/XNBzvvFKpX
Roads are most likely to get ICY as the snow is exiting toward the tail end of rush hour or a little later...when temps fall near to below freezing everywhere (5/x) https://t.co/21zkBGU9Xo
By the afternoon and evening commute, most spots should have snow with temps closing in on freezing. Road temps should initially be above freezing so NOT expecting things to get icy immediately...but some slush possible when snow comes down hard. (4/x) https://t.co/Y3mVoWsznr
Rain should start changing over snow from NW to SE across region in the early to mid-afternoon... temps still mostly above freezing. (3/x) https://t.co/LEXnjogOaK

Drip, drip, drip. Temps into mid-30s around DMV early this afternoon and snow, icicles slowly starting what will be several day melt-off. But refreeze tonight...which will have cause slushy, wet areas to re-freeze. This has implications for schools tomorrow. SchoolCast later...
Wow - thanks for all of the responses. Very helpful!
General question for those who have been out and about: How are roads in your neighborhoods? How are main roads? Let us know your county. Starting to work on SchoolCast and FedCast for tomorrow.
@MsMiyayo305 Not really. Our final call was 4-8" before the first flakes, with a 20% chance of 8-12...which is what you got.
Correction: Observed snow is left, predicted is right.
@NathanWurtzel Yes
@cmdilapi More like Fredericksburg/Stafford.
@ChrisSmolinski Thanks!
Here's a comparison of our final call snowfall map (left) and what fell (right). The problem was the jackpot zone ended up north of the forecast. It's always really hard to hit the bullseye. Otherwise, forecast was decent. More info: https://t.co/sejGbrrWb4 https://t.co/o1HrXJSNSN

@thumplik Stand by that statement. The sref is NOT a good snow model, ask any experienced meteorologist including those at NOAA. Our forecast was 2-4” at the time and 3-6” south of DC. We increased it slowly but surely and our general 4-8” forecast with locally higher amounts is on track.

@thumplik we're not calling noaa trash, but this particular tool is not useful for snow prediction in dc and - in many cases - is very misleading. it has uses in other applications.

@mattlanza Thanks so much. The scale has worked out well. Here's more on how we developed it: https://t.co/n1EfDwHVgc
@Vaphilly624 There is some chance of residual delays into Monday morning, depending on how long it takes for snow to end on Sunday and how quickly crews clear roads.
Of course, the impact will be lessened some by the fact it's a Saturday night to Sunday morning event, when many schools and business are closed. But this will likely affect church services and Sunday schools.
On our 1-5 storm impact scale, we are rating this weekend snow event for DC at Category 2, disruptive. But it's a borderline 3, especially for our southern areas. More info: https://t.co/Ezc0aOOFDQ https://t.co/xxdao6UnWC

Didn't get out of the 30s today, which helped DC end its incredible above normal temperature streak. 		28 days above normal in a row, ending yesterday, is the longest run in winter since 2006-07 when there were 30 in a row. https://t.co/Sr5WuYvmVJ https://t.co/3QovBaqa8E

@Defender13 It's not clear if the problems with the model were/are big enough that they would have a large enough effect to meaningfully degrade the forecast... So we continue to consider it among the rest of the model guidance.
@boopster277 Not til Sunday afternoon.
@jskleinman Should be okay then.
CORRECTION: The UKMet does not project 6" or more of snow. It's actually more like 3 to 4 inches.
@Wxmanms1 UGH-- I erred on this. Will correct the record. Thanks for flagging. - Jason
Finally, to add a third tweet, the European model has been most consistent in projecting 3-4" for this event in Washington. This is a reasonable middle ground but there are big range of possibilities for this storm. https://t.co/YHMKMTqXu6
But, if you like snow, both the Canadian and UKMet model project over 6" in DC. We are not fans of the Canadian model (very inconsistent) but the UKMet is pretty good. (2/2) More info: https://t.co/ic2ucWMI3y https://t.co/JA1GcpNWGY
If you don't like snow, the American modeling system (GFS) cut its average accumulation forecast in DC in half since yesterday (from around 4-5" to around 2-2.5"). Look at this animation of its 20 simulations today versus yesterday. (1/2) https://t.co/9IdzZjhfyj

This is a weird case where the forecast for the weekend snow has gotten harder since yesterday and the day before. Usually forecast confidence increases. This event has seemingly become more complex with greater model differences. UGH.
For some morning laughs/comedy, here's what one model (the NAM) predicts for the weekend snow event. It is an outlier and we don't think it's right, but it is amusing. Most other models predict 3 or 4 inches for DC. We'll have our updated forecast midday. #DCsnowhole https://t.co/a2jbncMVXG

Temps currently near 50 around the DMV. How high they go depends on how much skies brighten and how soon. Most spots should reach afternoon highs somewhere in the mid-50s to low 60s.
9:30am: Dense fog advisory remains in effect until 11am for shaded areas on map. Conditions improving but continue to drive with caution. https://t.co/2g3tT78LSG

Snow potential index: 1/10 - No alarm bells ringing quite yet, but next weekend could be worth watching for a coastal storm with wintry potential.

@AMetalstein The forecast for today was far from perfect, but the one you cite, says: "We’ve still got low clouds, fog and drizzle around early. Perhaps a few showers, as well. Nothing too intense, but it keeps things damp." That said, wain was heavier and lasted longer than we thought.

247p: Final batch of showers coming through. Nothing too intense but some brief downpours in a few spots. Should start moving out between 4 and 5p for last-minute voters. https://t.co/E3huONmxv8
@AMetalstein We did?
Agreed. Morning rain was heavier than anticipated, afternoon has been lighter than anticipated. Not a washout by any stretch. https://t.co/mktR9nIsef
Doug always lets us know what's coming our way. Clear skies incoming later this afternoon/evening. https://t.co/kCL8WESLro
The final round of rain has arrived in the western suburbs and is about to move into the Beltway. This won't last long -- showers end west to east between 4 and 6pm. https://t.co/692M9VIboM
It's so humid in N.C. that the automatic tabulators are rejecting soggy ballots. Board of elections says they're being kept in a bin until they dry out, basically. https://t.co/DeYTU5r9jE
130p: Nice gap in the rain around immediate DC area. Good time to vote. More showers possible around 3 or 4p. https://t.co/Bl61gEmhMI
Voters face miserable Election Day weather, but rain is unlikely to significantly dampen turnout https://t.co/Ge9n5G3Ao7
A break in the rain over DC before more showers move in mid-afternoon. https://t.co/ljUvdSE5G1

@jrgwx @islivingston It's not at all dishonest. There were no tornado warnings &amp; two EF-1 tornadoes hit. The headline is referring to tornadoes. And only 1 of 2 storms even had a severe t'storm warning. Not to mention no watches were in effect. Doubt few of the impacted folks felt warned.

Via @islivingston: Today was the 20th time DC has received at least 1" of rain this year - most on record year-to-date and just 1 event shy of the calendar year record 21 in 1878. https://t.co/EvQUBRzIhq
@TonyPannWBAL Thanks, Tony.
@mymdwx When we saw the HRRR and the noted the models showing the low forming right along the front, we were concerned Friday morning-midday. Admittedly, when the event started off with just light rain and we thought it would be too stable, but the dynamics overcame everything.
@mymdwx Yep- The two that touched down were not warned. And the two that were warned did not touch down, seemingly.
There was no warning. Here’s how two damaging tornadoes, one deadly, hit Maryland Friday night: https://t.co/vRx54KE36H
Today's 1.43 inches of rain in DC pushes the 2018 total to 55.1 inches, sixth most on record for a calendar year, and we still have about 8 weeks to go! https://t.co/EvQUBRzIhq https://t.co/J4BCzK32do
