@heyscottyb Best Timber since Summer 95, but so very different.
Well, there you have it. I live tweeted Right Off and hereby declare it the best of the electric Miles tunes. Yesternow a close second.
Hard to think of a better McLaughlin shred-fest than the last 90 seconds of the track.
and the last 4 min of the track, when literally no idea is left unresponded to - that's Miles at his best as a leader.
Grossman's solo over that Herbie vamp is something I'd love to see looped over a Marx Bros film one day. #juxtapose
Herbie finds his note and Billy Cobham dials in just as Miles tells Herbie to hit it. Then all hell breaks loose.
But I think the best part of the record is about 16 min in on Right Off. Herbie'a tooling around on the organ.
His ability to pick up on so many rhythmic and melodic ideas (easpecially during Grossman's solo in Right Off) = amazing.
Michael Henderson's playing on this album is so solid.
Now playing: Yesternow from Miles's "A Tribute to Jack Johnson." Finest jazz I know!
