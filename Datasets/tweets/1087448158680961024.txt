@1jaws1 @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity Is this like Obama not knowing his own wife's name from a man named Michael?
@AOC So you are saying she's an anti-semite?		Did you call out the anti-semite? Did you do anything when she said anti-semitic things?
@AOC I thought you were in control now?
@ChrisCuomo Name a politician who doesn't lie.		We'll wait.
@TheDemocrats Common core ruined our nation's public education system.
@elccollins @ThePlumLineGS Wait I thought you said she didn't misuse her security clearance?		Are you moving goal posts now?		If no one cared then why do you care now?
@elccollins @ThePlumLineGS What? https://t.co/BDFRUOSlQG
@ThePlumLineGS President has final say on classification.		It's a political point people are trying to drive home. I wonder why all this hubbub about Security Clearance and confidential information wasn't a bigger deal with Clinton. 		No one cared about Clinton's misuse of Security Clearance
@Elegant01300503 @lbiredneck @SahilS09627637 @dcherring @maggieNYT @saletan @ChrisCuomo Actually you didn't. Last administration has admitted to putting up roadblocks and pitfalls on their exit. Already been reported years ago.		When did I say anything about not prosecuting crimes? If their are crimes prosecute them.  Nice try though.
With the @TheDemocrats shying away from impeachment and taking a "slow burn" approach on @realDonaldTrump after the Cohen event and not relying on Mueller for the kill shot, this should be all the proof you need to know this entire Russian Collusion thing was a political strategy
@jakengracie2 @nytimes You don't trust the Democrats to making a good enough impeachment trial with evidence?		You're saying they have all this proof and they can convince the public?		They don't have the goods. They won't try and fail. If they had evidence they'd follow through
NEWSFLASH: Senior Democrats admit to no actual evidence of crimes.		If they had them, they'd impeach him. https://t.co/WhdMMObSvu
@liebjon2009 @nytimes If there is evidence why wouldn't they prosecute?		If they won't prosecute, maybe they lied about the evidence.		Just because you believe something to be true doesn't make it true.		Scientific method says "prove it"		The judicial system says "prove it"		So, prove it.
@BcBeanney @abbydphillip @BarackObama I can imagine @BarackObama leaving an American in North Korean custody for years and allowing him to be mistreated by a foreign government.		Cause it happened lol
@MichaelAvenatti So you going after former President Clinton?		We're sure you will...right?
@lbiredneck @SahilS09627637 @dcherring @maggieNYT @saletan @ChrisCuomo Funny... We haven't had a Peaceful transition of power for his presidency so I guess that's just or for the course now
@FredTJoseph How about people are prejudice and if you think you aren't you're lying to yourself
@GlennKesslerWP Why attempt something for a better future?		Really? You're that pessimistic? Lol
@RepAndreCarson Why do you not support stricter immigration controls and more decisive punishment for illegal immigrants when illegal immigrants KILL MORE AMERICANS  than Mass Shootings do?
@ThePlumLineGS Both things.		Creditability and the checks are important.		One does not rely on the other.		If you're honest about 1 thing when you have lied about 100 others... It simply means that 1 truth is actually true.		Checks = evidence. That is extremely important.
@SenateDems @SenWhitehouse Wait?		You mean Democrats never brought legislation up where they INTENDED to vote against it?
I believe this is called coaching a witness.		Why would someone who is coming clean about all the bad stuff he did consult with anyone but his lawyer?		I don't get it. https://t.co/enzupANES8
@tedlieu Would be the first of any party ho oringg their Oath Of Office
#CohenTestimoney #CohenHearings 		If @MichaelCohen212 had evidence of crimes @realDonaldTrump would already be going through impeachment		More grandstanding from the political class to make you believe they are doing something other than focusing on actual real American Problems
@PaulaDuvall2 @CNN So you believe black people are dumber than whites because their average IQ?		Congratulations you're a racist
@WeChooseBoth18 @CNN Funny how you think only Republicans lie.		Unable to pull the wool from your eyes.
@rosie_virgen @CNN Movie deals? Book deals? Lighter sentencing?		Are those not reasons to lie?		He admitted SDNY could lean favorably on his case. He said it on TV under oath.		Doesn't mean he's lying. Just means you're not very honest.
@WeChooseBoth18 @CNN You believe a decades old liar?		If someone hit you for a decade would you believe them when they said they would stop?		Honest question because I know he's saying things you want to hear but...
@JakeSherman @GlennKesslerWP Politicians shivering responsibility. Surprise surprise.
@mitchellreports He doesn't need to be discredited.		In what world do people willing accept a known liars word after decades of lying.		That doesn't mean he's not telling truths...		All this show does is affirm what each side already believes to be "true"
@GlennKesslerWP No rational person can look at Cohen and think he is telling 100% truth no matter what side of the aisle you're on.		Just because he's saying things people want to hear after years of telling lies doesn't make it true it makes it well rehearsed regardless of the amount of truth.
@MadreOfABabyBoy @maggieNYT I remember a time where people from all sides didn't like other people attacking others with what they felt like we're vicious jokes and the opposition side tell those people to get a sense of humor.		You act like humans don't human lol
@JoyAnnReid So you ignore a person's history of they tell you what you want to hear?		Good thing you're not an investigator lol
@adamscrabble It's reality TV for the masses.		Politicians play to the cameras and soundbites. Opiate for the Masses
@RepDonBeyer So you're trusting a known liar who worked for @realDonaldTrump for a decade?		I don't understand. Is he honest now? Honest then? Is he ever honest?
@tedlieu @GOP @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Funny you guys didn't have that attitude with @BarackObama 		It's kind of like all you people care about is what team you're on instead of the American people
Progressive says @realDonaldTrump is dumb.		Yet @MichaelCohen212 says he didn't want to be president. Yet he wanted help from the Russians to win.		So did he want to be president? Or did some dummy who didn't want to be president defeat @HillaryClinton and the @DNC? 		Whose dumb?
@tariqnasheed When will the community stop throwing their weight behind politicians that put other people of color and LGBTQ communities before yours?		The community votes... They vote for people who don't want this. 		Yet the community complains about not getting it.
@chetfking @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/1kIN2ZJn3M		Here's facts but the "progressive" base won't acknowledge them.		Illegal immigrants KILL MORE AMERICANS  than School shootings.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Here are more facts. 		Since you people won't ever address actual problems with 4 million UNKNOWN people in the United States or the fact that illegal immigrants KILL MORE AMERICANS THAN SCHOOL SHOOTINGS DO		https://t.co/1kIN2ZJn3M
@tariqnasheed It's not white America it's "progressive" America

@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump How does it feel to know you'll never be as good as him and you have to resort to Twitter to pretend you have value to the world?		You should concentrate on being a doctor cause last we heard it hasn't been going well for you
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump It's pretty funny that he's still more accomplished than you.
@sidemeat @CFagan1987 @realDonaldTrump So we shouldn't tax wealthier states?		I thought we wanted to tax the wealthy?
@CFagan1987 @sidemeat @realDonaldTrump So you don't believe in taxing the wealthy?
@Tralfamad0re @BL4K3Aspen @realDonaldTrump Um California also has record homeless and wealth inequality.		So you're cool with all the rich people being rich and screwing over the poor and working class because it suits your politics?
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Even though our Government was unable to work with billionaires to get a simple train project done.		We need to give the government more of our money so they can get other projects going and fail on those too.		This man claims to be a doctor.		Who would trust someone so stupid?
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Most Californians see it as a failure and a waste of our tax dollars.		Good try talking shit from Florida about a failed State Government project you have no clue about
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Also please validate mine and my brothers existence. 		Please papa?		Daddy?		Why won't you respond to me daddy?		All I want is your love and attention daddy.
@JackPosobiec https://t.co/XnuZUHM8X2
@JackPosobiec And you didn't use any major platforms for any search related to the words/items?		No dms with them? All that?
@JackPosobiec Were you completely alone?
@adamscrabble None taken. 		All we can do is execute and work towards things we want to see in the world. 		No one has all the answers and we don't know what we don't know
@adamscrabble You're 💯%		It's cultural for sure. We're in a constant state of cultural wars.		That's the world we live in. Everything is competing for the same limited resource. 		People. 		You got to offer what they offer and you got to do it better and add more value
@adamscrabble It's a tool but not a solution.		Legislation and restrictions are barriers of entries to those that are uneducated our under resourced.		What happens when you have an experienced group with plenty of resources and a field to grow that the big guys can't "own"? Opportunity
@adamscrabble You can expect to dethrone something built over decades. 		That's not how it works. It takes time and implementation and dedication. 		Most of all it takes vision and adaptability. Doesn't mean it will work it simply means there's always a chance for an empire to fall.
@adamscrabble You say it can't. Empires rise and fall. No one thought the monopolies of the past would die. Things change.		People don't.		We operate in a value driven fashion. Is there a system that can provide more value? Maybe.		How do we find out? That's the experience of startups.
@adamscrabble Now you see the fractured environment where... Big tech has to have complete control.		They no longer operate on a value driven principle of innovation but on of preservation. They know tech changes and so do economies. 		Survival is all that's left for them
@adamscrabble So you need to build a central authority that can moderate in a clear and transparent ways.		Like creating "laws" so that their is a system by which all parties engage. Then by creating a platform by which all parties can engage on. 		PayPal failed. Big tech failed.
@adamscrabble By taking what fuels them... Advertising revenue through use of their "railway" and their consumer data/lists/info.		Consumers are the battleground. Information are the weapons. 		Block chain won't take em down. It's anarchy. People trust central authorities.
@adamscrabble Censorship and deplatforming is the wave of the present and future. 		They cloak themselves in constitutional rights while paying the politicians to NOT regulate them and their behaviors		So... How do you break the traditional model?
@adamscrabble They now dominate enough market share that they can start herding their masses.		Through marketing, through "partnerships", through acquisitions and more.		You will either follow their lead or you will essentially not have your "train car" attached to the rails
@adamscrabble The advertising model today is literally taking on a life of its own. The need to further into people's lives is to dominate exposure and further trap them behind giant walls of "features" and "convienance"
@adamscrabble You're 100% dead on.		It's why our sponsors are building a "separate" internet. 		Aiming at the features and things people want and need. 		Big tech has to keep feeding the beast. Legally through fiduciary duties to their investors.
@SAlexaW @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump You’re wrong.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Ted, you are an out of touch troll. Have you learned nothing from 2016? Russia collusion was fake, media lied, and dems went all in on it. You lost. 		Signed, the people.
@GlennKesslerWP How about every politician for ever office releases their tax returns instead of playing political games
WHY IS NO ONE POSTING A PICTURE OF THE 10K PEOPLE AT THE BETO RALLY?		News isn't publishing a video or pictures of these people		Plenty of pictures and video of @realDonaldTrump crowd.		WHERE'S @BetoORourke @RepBetoORourke.		I don't understand if it's easy to prove. PROVE IT
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Where's a picture of 10K people at the Beto rally? Why is no one posting it?
@farnazfassihi Where the picture of 10K people at the Beto rally?
@JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump You obviously have no idea what fascism is lol
@hellcrapdamn @realDonaldTrump Prove it show us a picture
@calypsowo @jules_su I don't understand your logic? Are you an Adult? Are you another Adults responsibility? Are you unable to take care of yourself?		Why is it another adults responsibility to make sure to provide an opportunity for you? How do you reciprocate the responsibility?

@aleksjames54 @Timcast I agree. I simply term Anarchy as "Survival of the Fittest" 		As natural as the animal kingdom. 		I assume any person preaching any form of Anarchism wants an environment where they are simply free to exert power/force without reprisal from a strong man (Central Government)
@juju_b3ats @Timcast Find me a picture of every Antifa Cell flying a hammer and sickle. You cant. Because not all of them do. You can't even find how many ANTIFA cells there are because that is the whole point of a Decentralized ideology.
@ardwick @Timcast And you get into the weeds of the entire premise. 		ANTIFA is not a centralized movement and it reflects local culture and tribal ideology. 		Each cell/tribe does not agree on anything but the Destruction of the State which is an Anarchist position which is a far Right position
@aleksjames54 @Timcast Just like the political spectrum of our "Left" is not the same as the "Left" in Europe. 		Our ANTIFA is not the same as the historic ANTIFA that rose to prominence in Europe. 		It is an Americanized Anarchist movement that promotes local tribalism and uses Violence as a strategy
@aleksjames54 @Timcast European Political nature is much more Collective because of history. American Political nature is much more a rejection of the collective. We are breed to mistrust central authority as it's a part of the American Story
@aleksjames54 @Timcast That painting a broad brush on a decentralized movement isn't something that can be done. 		Each tribe has a leader (strong man) and each tribe has different Social-Economic ideologies. 		The one thing all ANTIFA has in common is the destruction of the State. Thats it.
@aleksjames54 @Timcast I hear you on that and I agree.		libertarians are anarchist when they wish for no central state. In this way they are the same as Anarchist just a different brand name.		Anarchist ideologies are by their nature Individualistics and tribalistic (small scale) my argument was
@juju_b3ats @Timcast Why do people use whatever means available to them to further support their political agenda? 		I don't know bro... that seems like a question that no one can answer
@jules_su So human beings can't enter into contracts of their own free will and weigh the value proposition of those contracts?		Are you telling me everyone is to stupid to know they are entering into an employment agreement to create wealth for someone else in exchange for a portion of it
@riotsquirl @SmugglesDiamond @washingtonpost Pretty simple. 		Karl Marx gave the world NOTHING OF VALUE and his ideology has been used to kill 100s of millions of people. 		Compare Christianity - Has Killed Millions. But has provided positive Value		Cite positive values given to the world by Marx's philopshy
@aleksjames54 @Timcast Libertarianism is a political party/movement and as such has become a player in State politics. Not large or influential but it has co-opted the State and decided to play its game.		ANTIFA/Anarchism hasn't and won't. That is a huge difference.
@aleksjames54 @Timcast The mainstream Libertarian movement does not believe in the abolishment of the State it believes in the restriction of the State. 		Libertarianism as generally accepted is not a De-Centralized political ideology where ANTIFA/Anarchist are.
@PeesOnDucks @Timcast Each one is different and each one has a central premise. The State = Fascism. 		They hate the Left and the Right because they believe in no central national Authority (Fascism)		Their vernacular makes no distinction between Left and Right only that the STATE must be abolished
@aleksjames54 @Timcast Libertarians are not the same as Anarcho-Communist. Libertarians still believe in the "State" while Anarchist believes in the Community. 		State and Community are very different in their usage and definition.
@aleksjames54 @Timcast I concede on this you are correct
RT @RandPaul: Instead of passing resolutions calling for US troops to stay even longer in Syria &amp; Afghanistan, my colleagues in the Senate…
@aleksjames54 @Timcast You can't nail down a decentralised group that literally spans the globe whos name means ANTI-FACIST as a far left movement when their entire premise is smashing the Central Government Model. 		They are not a unified group their only unified position is NO CENTRAL AUTHORITY
@aleksjames54 @Timcast You're prescribing an decentralised group that spans communities and cultures into a single box while ignoring their foundational principle which is Anarchy and the lack of centralized authority.		ANTIFA groups in California are different than Oregon and Washington and so on
@Timcast American ANTIFA is not the same as European ANTIFA and to join the two together is to ignore the reality behind each Movement. American ANTIFA has shown to be Anarcho-Tribalist. They want to destroy central authority and have localized autonomous community control
@ericswalwell @staceyabrams @realDonaldTrump Pot meet kettle
@7732stone @Trump454545 We just wrote an article on exactly what you're saying if you're interested	https://t.co/bc0xLyuZ0v
@Timcast You again have no understanding of Ideology. 		Anarchist believe in individual authority not collective authority. Anarachy is the survival of the fittest personified. That is ANTIFA. They reject centralized authority and believe in tribal authority. That is why they USE FORCE
@Timcast Antifa is not the left. 		They are an anarchist group which puts them at the extreme right. 		How do people not understand the political Spectrum.		LEFT is COLLECTIVISM	RIGHT is INDIVIDUALISM		Anarchy is a state of disorder due to absence or nonrecognition of authority.

@washingtonpost Now do an Analysis on the bullying of Highschool Children wearing MAGA hats by the News Media
The State of Our Union. 	A Nation Divided 	A Nation of Mob Rule	A Nation of no Moral Conscious	Where are our Leaders?	Americans are dying on the Street	Americans are living in poverty	Americans are suffering
Companies, People, ADULTS attacked Children and tried to make them Political effigies to rile up the Masses. It was a modern-day lynching. An attack completely designed to turn Americans against each.  A Digital mob after the blood of children.
The Covington High School incident is the shining example of how much the Media tries to manipulate Americans into emotional outburst and anger.	https://t.co/RHO0DLDY3t
The social engineering of turning Brother against Brother, Sister against Sister, Families against each other because of the side of the coin they choose to identify with has become pervasive within our Culture.
Unfortunately, our Union is plagued by an incestuous relationship between the Media and Politicians. The reality TV which shapes the opinions of Americans across the country.
We live in a Nation that is run by the Media Outrage machine, where big Tech “Deplatforms” competitors to News Media Agencies, and where Politicians continue to be held UNACCOUNTABLE for their words and deeds.
There are many things wrong within the union. The Media Companies hold a Monopoly. Big Tech holds a monopoly. Payment Processors that have built modern commerce have a monopoly.
What was once a call for Unity within the Union, a shared American enterprise, now has become a battleground to attack our fellow citizens.		https://t.co/bc0xLyuZ0v

@realDailyWire It's not about journalism it's about selling a Marketing narrative to the American People that the media is the only thing standing between them and dictatorship.		Same strategy politicians use. FEAR to get people to be AFRAID and look towards an AUTHORITY FIGURE for help

Or are you guys only able to view morality issues with people outside your party? 		Kinda hypcritcal
@washingtonpost Yet she still supports @TheDemocrats even though @CoryBooker is a self admitted Sexual Predator
@mdloa734 @econnol @RepSwalwell @BreitbartNews Always remember that @ericswalwell tried to push a law that made it a FEDERAL CRIME to attack JOURNALIST because in 2018 4 Journalist died in the US due to a crazy person attacking a News Media outlet.		@ericswalwell believes Journalists are more than everyday Americans

@AOC @Lawrence Each side is holding Americans hostage a fraction of % of federal budget. If you actually care about people. A clean bill to keep those workers paid while everything else is put on hold for R vs D debate on how to solve illegal immigration		https://t.co/1kIN2ZJn3M
@AOC @jacobinmag we will		https://t.co/fi3UTCbRY8
@Newsweek Neither does Congress		https://t.co/Vt6VNHtNhf
@thehill NEWS FLASH: No one has solutions to solve decades old problem
@washingtonpost At this moment in time, she wins the centrist if she holds out or @realDonaldTrump declares a National Emergency. He hasn't communicated a reason that connects with most Americans on Illegal Immigration.
@SethAbramson A simple fact is that each side is playing politics inside of solving problems. To act like one side has a moral high ground over less than a fraction of a % of the budget is ridiculous and to act like Illegal immigration doesn't hurt Americans is ridiculous.
@JudicialWatch Do as we say not as we do
@JoyAnnReid @TheLastWord @SpeakerPelosi Not really, to normal people they both are children who can't solve a problem and are bickering over pennies
@RubinReport missed opportunity to call it  "Dear Diary"
@washingtonpost That's not true. There is no way all their followers have more than the mainstream media does. You're the originators of fake news 🤣🤣🤣

@ATXRoseRed @DavidJHarrisJr @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi The country knows both parties only use demographics to win the election. That isn't telling anyone anything new. Only Party Diehards and fringe groups have blind faith to one party over the other.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Would you say that the FBI is a shining example of how law enforcement should operate?
RT @SethAMandel: Watching ppl turn on the fact-checkers they idiotically empowered (they're just liberal blogs that appeal to authority ins…
@SethAMandel @benshapiro a very apt description
@DavidJHarrisJr @realDonaldTrump This hopefully is simply a feign. He already conceded on the #SOTU which has put him in a lesser position against @SpeakerPelosi. If he declares an end run around Congress he has lost the fight and only solidifies him with his core base.
@thehill We agree... maybe you shouldn't of dug in on something that is worth a fraction of a % of the total budget and focus on solving an issue you and your peers haven't solved in nearly 4 Decades
@Acosta @mattyhoyeCNN Please call it "Dear Diary"
@Timcast Honest question, do you think there is a better format to support an independent journalist?  Our payment &amp; fundraising platform will allow free speech and content to flow and allow people and organizations to have subscribers. We would love feedback on things that are missing.
@gehrig38 @JackPosobiec @ericswalwell @AOC @TuckerCarlson Lol I mean it's probably the jawline and the hair. Those eyes though... they just seem like a dead ferret
Truth https://t.co/019KbsHDoW
@gehrig38 @JackPosobiec @ericswalwell @AOC @TuckerCarlson Always remember he tried to make a law that made attacking journalist a federal crime because 4 were unfortunately murdered in 2018 by a crazy person.		4 deaths motivated him to action. Yet the deaths of Americans at the hands of illegal immigrants is a non-issue to him.
@RepDanCrenshaw @DonaldJTrumpJr Neither Party's priority is getting things done. It's all about playing reality tv star.
@JackPosobiec @RepSwalwell is the same person who tried to make it a federal crime to attack a journalist because 4 were murdered by a crazy person. 		He doesn't seem to care about any American who isn't a journalist or a lobbyist.
@thehill One crocodile calling another one crocodile
@greggutfeld we hear you and agree with the sensationalism of the news media and their incestuous relationship with politicians. It's why we are creating a platform to combat it. Track them year after year story after story
@AOC @GlennKesslerWP We agree lol. 		https://t.co/ABZv1ufWKX
@SenAlexander @POTUS It's not. Your side just sucks at framing an argument that everyone can understand. If you can't convince the public how hypocritical your opposition is that a problem with your organization

@KellyO @MittRomney One of the only few things I agree with coming from Mitt Romney
@JoyAnnReid But they did. Each side has. Each side denies the other. Why are you obfuscating the reality of the situation? Each side has proposed to get the workers paid and each side has put the middle finger to the other. 		By the way don't you have gays to hate?

@tedlieu @VP @mike_pence Dear @tedlieu both of you grow up. Stop playing with people's lives and stop acting like your party hasn't wasted more money year over year on useless shit. 0.13% of the budget is not a national issue, both parties playing with American lives is, however.
@WSJ Why don't they pass a law that makes all politicians records public? The people have a right to know about every single one of them.
@Newsweek 🤣🤣🤣 that picture though...
@ggreenwald @jairbolsonaro It's laughable you would think most investors would care about that. Some sure. Most? Doubtful
@Cernovich nope
@HRC Two groups who don't care about solving problems. 		Even if 66% of the total est. 12M here illegally are overstayed visas that leaves 4M unknowns which is more than our 5 least populace states. More people die from illegals than in school shootings.		https://t.co/1kIN2ZJn3M
@HuffPost It does make him look like he conceded. He either is going to throw an audible or he has lost this fight.
She should really word it better or better communicate what those numbers actually mean so everyone understands		2% of $50M = $1M	3% of $1B = $30M		Then when she is challenged on this normal people don't have to do the Math. It will communicate better and show it isn't "unfair" https://t.co/G2CEEARHqE
@SilverWingsPega @SenatorMenendez @SenateDems We're talking about every single motion and bill on each side squabbling about 0.13% of the Federal Budget and holding 800K lives over the other side heads because they want to make believe they actually give a shit about Americans

@TeamPelosi @TheDemocrats If it was really about American Workers you would simply pay them and bicker with @realDonaldTrump until you're both blue in the face. Both sides playing with peoples lives. You all waste money every year on stupid shit you could waste a few paychecks worth until you make a deal
@chrislhayes There is a profitable model. If you can produce value to consumers they will support you in your efforts. It's time to rethink the news media. 		You can be a business based on advertising revenue = Click Bait and Manipulation of Current Events		Or you can be one that gives value
@chuckwoolery 6 Media Companies own 90% of all media consumed in the US. 		We created ANAR Project to track how they manipulate current event and their mercenary Reporters actions as well.		https://t.co/cBgS1Dhr9u

@TulsiGabbard Funny how you never called this same behavior out against members of Congress and the Senate doing the same shit.
@Timcast It's ridiculous to think a business would make a terrible business decision that would literally end their business lol
@GOP @VP https://t.co/1kIN2ZJn3M		- Estimated 12 Million Illegal Immigrants	- 66% Overstay Visa	- 4 Million Illegal Immigrants are completely UNKNOWN to the US Government	- That is the equivalent of 5 1/2 of our least populous states
@RealJamesWoods 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
@SenatorMenendez @SenateDems Why did a large majority of politicians vote against paying the workers so you and the opposition can continue bicker and grandstand without it hurting people
@RealJamesWoods @SenSchumer Because it's about division and grandstanding instead of working together to solve problems. The political class and the media do these things for views. We have an adversarial system instead of one that demands solutions. People only care about their team winning
@SenatorMenendez @SenateDems If you people cared about workers then you would vote to pay them and continue your bickering
@SenDuckworth @SenateDems @SecretaryRoss Why didn't all politicians vote to end their suffering and make sure they get paid so you could continue your bickering about the wall? 		If you say... Open the government first. You are leveraging human lives to get your way. 		Pay the workers and let the political class bicker
@sxdoc @realDonaldTrump They made it a national emergency when 4 journalists were killed by a lunatic in 2018. They want to restrict the 2nd because 55 deaths happened from school shootings. More deaths happen because of illegal immigration and no one does a thing. https://t.co/1kIN2ZJn3M
@tannerstake @RyanAFournier @AOC It's much more than that. They want to restrict the 2nd over school shootings and @RepSwalwell wrote a bill to make attacking journalist a federal crime when only 4 journalists were killed in 2018 in the US by a lunatic. https://t.co/1kIN2ZJn3M
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS The media won't get the views and clicks they need to stay afloat if they took an honest position on reporting facts. Not all would be in your favor but not all would be against you either. Big Media + Politicians = Ratings! https://t.co/ABZv1ufWKX
@RealJamesWoods We call it incestuous, Big Media + Politicians. @RepSwalwell supported a bill to make attacking journalist a federal crime when only 4 journalist deaths happened in the US in 2018. He doesn't give a shit about anyone else but his microphone holders https://t.co/ABZv1ufWKX
@realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump take your message directly to the people again and lay out the reality with their own numbers. Estimated 12 Million Illegals. 66% overstayed Visas. That leaves nearly 4 Million unknowns. That is 5 1/2 of our least populous states. https://t.co/EJaLuX3k9l
@BuckSexton Great piece. It's laughable he called your point spin. They want to continue pointing to whos shutdown it is none of these talking head want to talk about the reality of a bunch of adults who can't solve a problem. https://t.co/1kIN2ZJn3M
@DonaldJTrumpJr That's because all they do is manipulate current events for advertising revenue. Pure profit Motive because they have no other way to generate revenue then dividing Americans	https://t.co/ABZv1ufWKX
@NBCNews @MeetThePress For someone that claims to care about people she obviously doesn't give a shit about the impact of illegal immigration and the lives, it can save by tackling the issue. For Wall or Against Wall... It's a major issue that effects lives of Americans https://t.co/1kIN2ZJn3M
@HRC @PattyMurray @LambdaLegal @OutServeSLDN Fear mongering. Either for or against the trans ban it has zero to do with National Security.
@GOPLeader @GOPLeader Start framing the conversation so every American understands the impact of Illegal Immigration so they can make the most educated decision. Even if 66% overstayed visa that leaves 4 Million unknowns in our country. Nearly 5 1/2 States worth https://t.co/EJaLuX3k9l
@panayis @ScottAdamsSays @realDonaldTrump It's about optics. Regardless if you want them gone or not. @realDonaldTrump is not going to commit political suicide and eliminate Americans while they are on shutdown. Normal, every day, centrist voters would see that as the biggest slap in the face to other citizens.
@JackPosobiec Honestly, you are dead on with that lol. You've inspired us to do an article on specifically that comparison.
@spiritchild11 @TexanJustin @meschief_55 @Dellapearl @ScottAdamsSays Doesn't matter what Scott says... doesn't make it a reality. It doesn't make Nancy look bad at all lol. I despise her and I can tell you objectively that until @realDonaldTrump makes his next move she looks to be in control of the situation. This is either feign or lost.
@panayis @ScottAdamsSays There is no realm of reality that @realDonaldTrump would force the shutdown (doesn't matter if right or wrong) let the court of public opinion play out with the federal workers and payroll and then start cutting employment. That would be throwing a hairspray can into a bonfire.
@adamscrabble Twitter can't afford it is the only reason why. It is a house of cards laying on a foundation of constant manipulation to not collapse in on itself. If they were to expose the internals they would be sued into oblivion just like every other major media advertiser for fraud

@spiritchild11 @meschief_55 @Dellapearl @ScottAdamsSays That's not how normal people see it. This is a stalemate. Nothing has changed. Neither is forced to budge any further to the other side. Nancy's footing just looks a lot more solid in this exact moment. He needs a follow-up move.
@ScottAdamsSays He conceded and it just looks like he conceded to normal people. He either has a secondary move to play or he has given Nancy Pelosi a better position in public opinion. The are in the same stalemate Nancy just looks like she has more solid footing in this exact moment.
@MZHemingway 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
@bdomenech @SebGorka Don't forget... These are the same people who turned 4 unfortunate deaths into a National Emergency that the Press we're under attack and democracy would die without them. 4 Deaths Nationally in a year... Now telling you nothing is wrong with illegal immigration.
@adamscrabble Thank you we much appreciate it. We are lucky to be a corporate-backed public interest project. We don't need to worry about selling as our foundation comes from a booming industry. We simply want to build the engine that can channel the publics collective abilities.

@tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Ted, you’re a liar. No other nation has a constitution either. They are ran by kings ministers or dictators. 		We the people voted you all in.
