Congress should repeal and replace the ‚ÄúAffordable Care Act,‚Äù which spends $940B, reduces Medicare benefits $523B and raises taxes $569B.
Raising taxes, cutting Medicare and creating a new entitlement program is not health care reform. This law must be repealed and replaced.
The Democratic leadership has no budget for the federal government. And this is because they have no priorities to reduce federal spending.
My faith is in the American entrepreneur ‚Äì not the federal government ‚Äì to grow our economy.
