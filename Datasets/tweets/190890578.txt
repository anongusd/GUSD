When we talk about corruption in the system, it's not just the bad behavior of people who know how to get away with abusing the system. We're also talking about the implicit rules of the game being rigged in favor of the people who write the rules.
Because, if you're saying those things, you're not participating in the debate. Sorry, you're not tall enough for this ride.
Or do you mean to say that frivolous lawsuits are a worse civic consequence than corporations and powerful parties taking advantage of working people?
So what you mean to say is that our legal system can't figure out which lawsuits are frivolous and which are legitimate?
Well, you say, if we have laws like that, people will abuse the system and file frivolous law suits.
When screwing people who work for you is a cost of doing business, and a cheaper expense than treating people equitably, the system is broken. Unions do help, but introduce their own problems, such as locking out non-union workers, and reducing incentives for high quality work.
Trump represents many things, but a lesson we aren't learning well enough from his example is the way the costs of enforcing the basic fairness ensconced in our legal system disproportionately advantages the interests of powerful entities with built-in budgets for "lawfare."
You know what's cooler than the collective bargaining power of unions? Laws that give real teeth and bite to employees and contractors who are routinely raked by unscrupulous business practices. Mandatory treble damages, mandatory attorneys fees for smaller parties. https://t.co/F0B826mn7J

It won't be unanimous, but I bet you're going to find a lot more takers than people willing to sacrifice their lives for principles, especially when those principles are not protected and upheld by the system that pretends to offer them universally.
Ask adults with student loans that they'll be paying until they're grandparents if they would trade the availability of political dissent for the opportunity to be debt free and a homeowner.
Ask people who spend half their days commuting to and from work if they'd trade Google for sensible, fast and efficient mass transit.
Ask people who go bankrupt paying their medical bills if they'd trade the "right to know" for the peace of mind that comes from affordable health care.
For all the noise in our discourse about the dangers of socialism, you'd think we'd all be forced to deal with the fact the results produced by the version of state capitalist socialism taking shape in China is making the virtues of "free and open society" look a bit ineffective.
This is among our last opportunities to force China to accept the liberal order. The West needs to figure that out in a hurry, or get used to permanent junior partner status.
But long term China will always shift the system in their favor, and the first world's consumer addiction to Chinese goods will blind us to the consequences of the forthcoming illiberal order where China's power will dictate the terms of all deals.
Whatever comes out of the trade negotiations, China will continue to operate by its own rules. They will make the needed concessions to grease the economic rails on all sides, making (some) corporations happy (for now), and the stakeholders will walk away with faces saved.
Reciprocity will never happen because China knows that the public's "right to know" and freedom of thought will quickly destroy their system.

All the analogies in the @mckaycoppins and @SykesCharlie banter are off. If they remain in the GOP, the antecedent corollary for the #NeverTrumpsters are the proslavery apologists like #UBPhillips who claimed that slavery “was benevolent in intent” and “beneficial in effect.”
Like all responsible American citizens should, they have made clear that this is not who we are, nor who we ever were or who we would strive to be. So how do you unscramble that egg? How do you now go back and side with white nationalists without complicity?
The problem for @BillKristol and other #NeverTrumpsters is that the jig is up. Few have made the argument more effectively that Republican politics are now clearly and explicitly designed to appeal to white nationalists than those in their movement. https://t.co/lLiMMbamUo

You have time to get out, but we're counting in months and election cycles, not years, and definitely not decades.
This isn't to call all Republicans "racists." But the culture is quickly moving past the reality where this identity was a socially acceptable sublimation to one where our eyes are open to the fact that it's a party that represents the cultural institution of white supremacy.
In the Post Trump era, there's no more room for serious people to pretend that the Republican party represents anything other than a place for white people to work out their unconscious or otherwise suppressed feelings of racial anxiety.
You can manufacture narrative to tie these positions together, but you can't call that circuitous fable a "philosophy." It just doesn't obtain.
For militaristic adventure when it's good for their corporate constituents, rather than when it's good for their citizens, or the cause of liberty in the world. (Neocons get a pass here but, as the critical mass makes clear, they already realize they're no longer Republicans.)
For "family values" except when the families are poor, not Christian and not white, or otherwise not aspiring to white Christian values.
Another way to say this:		Against socialism, except when dealing with giant corporations and high net worth individuals.
For free market capitalism and market competition except when it comes to tax policy and sweetheart corporate incentives that reward market stifling megacorp "bigness" and subsidize wealth preservation.
For limited government and statist overreach, except when it comes to issues like abortion and law enforcement, where libertarian thrust gives way to policies clearly designed to preserve the social order in favor of, uh, let's be gentle and call it the "propertied elites."
I mean, look at the party. Is it really a mystery? 		The Republican party is a collection of ideas held together not by internally consistent logic and intellectual honesty, but a series of conceits and sleight of hand.		These are obvious, but high level summary would include:
Why, what socially unacceptable beliefs find themselves maturely expressed in this political philosophy, you ask?
Conservatism can be intellectuallized and put into various historical contexts, but the underwhelming—if also glaringly obvious—truth about those drawn to the "grown-up" "ideas" and "principles" espoused by the GOP is that they're actually drawn to its sublimating power.
The Republican party has long been allowed to slide past the historical reality that nationalism and socialism are the formula for their movement. It's a socialism not of national treasure, but national identity.
