What would Oprah Winfrey offer the American people, that president Trump hasn't been doing from day one.  Yet me guess, more depression, low paying jobs, open border for illegals,more money for government, and more regulations. Just stay with what you think your great at.
I can't believe how the media "msnbc" takes a Trump tweet about NK, and throws it out to the American people as a scare tactic. Grow some balls.
