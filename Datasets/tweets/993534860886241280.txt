@AStratelates "Because Christians, Muslims and Jews believe in God, but are prohibited from believing (worshiping) gods." - "Not any?"
@AStratelates How is the belief in any god or gods "reasonable, rational, natural and beneficial"?
@AStratelates Not any?
@AStratelates "Christ is real" is a claim.

@TVictorinus @Schmoop0521 @Phoenix42505497 @ToddW29538160 @remnantofisrae1 @AiG @JoeMDodd85 They don't have to. The science speaks for itself.
@TVictorinus @Schmoop0521 @Phoenix42505497 @ToddW29538160 @remnantofisrae1 @AiG @JoeMDodd85 The problem is that they're probably from pseudoscience sources, such as AIG.
@TVictorinus @Schmoop0521 @Phoenix42505497 @ToddW29538160 @remnantofisrae1 @AiG @JoeMDodd85 "a prokaryote ingested another prokaryote which started the evolutionary process." Who says that? Show me an article, a paper, something where a scientist has said that.
@TVictorinus @Schmoop0521 @Phoenix42505497 @ToddW29538160 @remnantofisrae1 @AiG @JoeMDodd85 The science for what? I have to ask since you're chiming in out of nowhere.
@JoeMDodd85 @Schmoop0521 @Phoenix42505497 @TVictorinus @ToddW29538160 @remnantofisrae1 @AiG We ACCEPT the evidence. You don't seem to get that.

@ToddW29538160 @remnantofisrae1 @Phoenix42505497 @Schmoop0521 @AiG @TVictorinus @JoeMDodd85 So it's okay to tell them that everything poofed into existence because of a wizard?
@ToddW29538160 @remnantofisrae1 @Phoenix42505497 @Schmoop0521 @AiG @TVictorinus @JoeMDodd85 There you go, showing that you don't know OR blatantly misuse the term Theory. Sad. Which of us is being dishonest now?
@ToddW29538160 @remnantofisrae1 @Phoenix42505497 @Schmoop0521 @AiG @TVictorinus @JoeMDodd85 And many more are here lying to kids saying that a god does exist.

@ToddW29538160 @remnantofisrae1 @Phoenix42505497 @Schmoop0521 @AiG @TVictorinus @JoeMDodd85 But I don't. I don't tell my kids what to believe as far as religion goes. That's for them to figure out.

@Phoenix42505497 @Schmoop0521 @remnantofisrae1 @ToddW29538160 @AiG @TVictorinus @JoeMDodd85 You assume everything was created. You have no evidence.

@ToddW29538160 @remnantofisrae1 @AiG @TVictorinus Evolution is Evolution. The amount of time it takes does not matter.
@Phoenix42505497 @remnantofisrae1 @AiG @TVictorinus @ToddW29538160 @JoeMDodd85 You should start accepting what science says.

@remnantofisrae1 @AiG @TVictorinus @ToddW29538160 "do you have a set of beliefs about origins? Did life create itself or was it created by intelligent aliens?" - How did life begin on Earth? I don't know. However, once life began on Earth, it began to evolve.

@realDonaldTrump And as soon as they say or do something you don't like you'll say they should have stayed in Venezuela.
@realDonaldTrump You should know that people know by now that you're just a fucking liar, right?

@GerryDodge1 @aigkenham Not in itself. But when you tie your kids down with bad beliefs and poor education you limit them.
@SteveKerr Was my favorite @NBA player and he's one of my favorite people. https://t.co/iVW5R7m5ed

@WLWT His secret for keeping his weight down?
@aigkenham "a creationist Christian worldview based school". Great. So she'll be serving my kids fries in 15 years.
@TomiLahren If a kid were suspended for a shirt that said "IMPEACH TRUMP" you'd be on the school's side. Don't pretend you wouldn't be.
RT @funnymanfields: What if Ray Charles was drinking regular Pepsi all those years and no one told him?
@TIME Yet we have a president accused of the same thing and nobody does a thing.
@NotchLickKat @WLWT Stupidest comment ever. It's the perfect time to protest. I guess you support the #FirstAmendment when it doesn't offend your delicate sensabilities?
@VP More work to screw the American people?
@realDonaldTrump vs @BarackObama 		Numbers don't lie. https://t.co/0M1G7eUFHG
@MSNBC @NBCNews #fakenews
@realDonaldTrump would rather go to war with #NorthKorea than to sit down with their leader and make peace. #WorstPresidentEver #NorthKoreaSummit
The FAILING US President @realDonaldTrump cancels a meeting with North Korea then calls it a setback. “I feel it is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting," Really? Moron. https://t.co/l1jTNI8a9I

@AiG Some are.
@realDonaldTrump By "WITCH HUNT!" do you mean the investigation into @HillaryClinton ? Because then, yes, that was a witch hunt. The investigation into YOU, however............
Why is the @NFL bending to the will of @realDonaldTrump supporting snowflakes? Players want to use their #FirstAmendment RIGHTS, nothing more. https://t.co/bw7OHoFjgg
@WLWT 1st Amendment. Don't agree with the shirt. But this violates the 1st Amendment.
@jason_lisle What science is done ath the BS Institute?
Here's a little something for everybody like @kenthovind @erichovind @aigkenham @AiG @ICRscience who LOVE to misquote #CharlesDarwin 's quote about the eye. https://t.co/UjL4408S5u
@realDonaldTrump They say something about @BarackObama (who has  more twitter followers than you, BTW) and suddenly you like them?

@TomiLahren Respected for what? What have you EVER done?
@squid_615 @ericdubay At the very beginning of the video - ancient people believing the Earth is flat is NOT an argument OR evidence for a flat earth
@squid_615 @ericdubay I'll take notes.
@squid_615 @ericdubay Evidence. Not claims.
@realDonaldTrump @AsaHutchinson Asa must be a terrible person for you to endorse him.
@ericdubay What evidence do you have that the Earth is flat?
@CNN All of those are reasons why he's an idiot.
