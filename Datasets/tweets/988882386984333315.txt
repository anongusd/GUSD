@DavidJesse101 @skywookie_0ne @Chirparrooo @PsychopompGecko @RespectableLaw @TamponsForTrump @undergbastard @MiraclesArt Not seeing ANYONE getting jobs here. Not for one sec saying there aren't racial injustices, there are. Most poignantly of which you just spoke re: jail. On your side. Being equal though, being white doesn't make you racist. If that were the case we would've never seen any reform.
Incorrectly, therefore not being clear. But I do know, the only one person I know who uses the phrase "bless your heart", is the most vile excuse of a woman, who happens to be a trumpette and has the lowest IQ I've ever personally known. Sorry for invading your feed.
To run too deep. And unity seems an ever lost ideology. I succumb to the fact that if you're racist you will continue to urge others to be. If you aren't, but you are white, you will continue to be accused. Also concede, that I'm not a writer, and maybe I've chosen my words...
Please DM, I would be laughing too, at my ignorance of Twitter, but my ignorance, or should I say sheltered, reality strays so far from what I'm observing. My plight has been to stand against my own perception of a racist troll comment, but to no avail. The hatreds appear... https://t.co/R9GufstLGf
@king_of_bob @reinereignante @skywookie_0ne @Chirparrooo @PsychopompGecko @RespectableLaw @TamponsForTrump @undergbastard @MiraclesArt Concede over-generalized statement... but are you seeing the significance of the gap in these numbers? Black people are not the cause of lice though - if anything, white people are. The point about "nit-picking" though is that it was bigoted term w/ false merit.
@skywookie_0ne @reinereignante @Chirparrooo @PsychopompGecko @RespectableLaw @TamponsForTrump @undergbastard @MiraclesArt Look in mirror baby if you want to see racism/hatred. I know what I am, racist is not part of that equation. The impugnance you're selling is on the other side of the fence. My point from the onset was re a mechanic wanna be lawyer, fueling a racist comment re: the word "monkey"
@DavidJesse101 @skywookie_0ne @Chirparrooo @PsychopompGecko @RespectableLaw @TamponsForTrump @undergbastard @MiraclesArt My point... why cry? Unless you're part of that 15%, you're all equally f***ed!
@hornechuck @MiraclesArt @RespectableLaw Racism is a mental disability, running rampant in the south. Should I reply to insult with insult? I could, b/c I'm offended. But I won't b/c I refuse to breed this hatred. My "ignorance" stems from innocence... taught to be loving. Not piteous - genuine.  GOLDEN RULE
@reinereignante @skywookie_0ne @Chirparrooo @PsychopompGecko @RespectableLaw @TamponsForTrump @undergbastard @MiraclesArt Then please update the medical journals, because that is the claim. I'm not calling for this, I'm reiterating an educated claim from text. It was a syreotyped faux pa of previous generations that blacks caused lice, and debunked by the medical community.
@reinereignante @skywookie_0ne @Chirparrooo @PsychopompGecko @RespectableLaw @TamponsForTrump @undergbastard @MiraclesArt It's the law that they are classified this way. I didn't make it, and I don't agree with it. But if we don't unite and put this shit back in its proper timeline, it isn't going to change.
@lockhart_jesse @Dan_Seattle @TheYankeeMan @ja_callaway @HarleyPeyton @DavidAFrench Quite contrarily of triggered. Just as I would for women, who btw were suppressed/oppressed beyond minorities... daughters couldn't even inherit property. Numbers matter and aren't represented properly. Yes, whites are majority of business holders, BUT with upper 1% owning That.
@DavidJesse101 @skywookie_0ne @Chirparrooo @PsychopompGecko @RespectableLaw @TamponsForTrump @undergbastard @MiraclesArt Ask the "majority" in the lower 85% economic class, just how that superiority is working out for them. Bet you they're suffering the same as any minority member. Had I been forced to accept definition of my race based on every stereotypical characteristic, I would be BLUE.
@skywookie_0ne @Chirparrooo @PsychopompGecko @RespectableLaw @TamponsForTrump @undergbastard @MiraclesArt FACTUAL they do not. Just like white people don't get sickle-cell. (Mixed people can depending on DNA, yet in US their race is defined by father's racial status).
@DanielFluellen2 @CarolynColson @DaDutchGuy1 @runzwithknives @chelmex No, it's not. But I'll bet you only hear it coming from a flipping mechanic (or similar technician) because someone managed to secure a solution to a problem that didn't require paying them some money. That's the only context I've Ever heard it in.
@slkysoulsis @MiraclesArt @RespectableLaw Clearly. I'm seeing that. It's shameful. Bless the southerners' little hearts. 		Such hatred on every level, not just racial.
@Chirparrooo @PsychopompGecko @RespectableLaw @TamponsForTrump @undergbastard @MiraclesArt Thought pea pickin' was same as nit-pickin' which is also about poor, dirty, white folk (black people do not get lice), no? And cotton pickin' was only relative to state of mind. Nonetheless, they're all antiquated figures of speech with no true merit. This too much mincing.
@runzwithknives @CarolynColson @chelmex @DaDutchGuy1 @RespectableLaw Not exactly what I said... It's an economic insult. It was used by the likes of this guy, who weren't getting the opportunity to scam you by, quite literally, throwing a monkey wrench into your engine and breaking it so you would have to return for more service. He's a con.
@CarolynColson @DaDutchGuy1 @runzwithknives @chelmex I wouldn't... he did, and I'm disgusted by this guy's insistence on its meaning and inciting others. It has derogatory roots intended to offend poor white people subverting the need for him, not poc. Which again comes down to a class issue.
@justawren @anthonyglamis @Mdarbyreid @RespectableLaw Suffice it to say, we're all getting confused. Porch monkey - clearly racist. Watch that monkey run - definitely racist. But, monkeying around - a pleasurable pastime, not racist. 		Maybe need translator for southern dialect.
@ArmedfceSndwich @undergbastard @MiraclesArt @RespectableLaw It could also mean that someone is a troll, as well as a respectable lawyer. Exploitation and dissemination.
@SHRpuravida @undergbastard @MiraclesArt @RespectableLaw Yes, context matters. Not an R, and I watched the statement, and was not said with racial intent. He would have said the same thing about a white opponent, but someone ran with it MAKING it controversial. Trolls everywhere.
@MiraclesArt @RespectableLaw Yes honey, I'm aware, bless your heart as well. The south, where racism lives in the hearts of all. Infecting the English language w negative/racist connotations. Guess I'd better not enjoy my moments of monkeying around w/my grandchildren or I'll be racist. Get real.
@BruceMcF @RespectableLaw I'll concede to your state thinking, with that I agree.
@nwhepcat @RespectableLaw Just somewhere in the US where people don't go to their car repair shop to retain their lawyer. And we don't go to Google to define the figures of speech that include the word monkey. Either you're a troll, very young/naive, or just plain racist yourself. Context matters.
@Dan_Seattle @TheYankeeMan @ja_callaway @HarleyPeyton @DavidAFrench Disagree. For &gt; 85% it doesn't matter what your ethnicity is, you're oppressed. Most whites get oppressed because they have no special interest groups/benefits - getting denied education/ employment/entitlements to allow for "minorities". It's ECONOMIC we must recognize &amp; unite.
@RespectableLaw Hmm, your "name" implies you're a lawyer. And maybe in Texas, you're racists in general if the word monkey has such implications. But the rest of the world is much larger than Texas. If you're going to propogate these assertions, then you are "monkeying up" the English language.
@RespectableLaw Then quit googling figures of speech... you are flat out wrong b/c Google is flat out wrong - it is nothing more than a computer. Human beings do not communicate via 1's and 0's. And the algorithms for the terms w/ "monkey" in them are not computing directly.
@RespectableLaw NOT TRUE... any poor person knows how to do this to survive.
@RespectableLaw NOT TRUE... it's when they scam people for more business.
@CarolynColson @chelmex @DaDutchGuy1 @RespectableLaw Politicians definitely should. But still must say I've never heard n***er- ringing used as a racist slur...only as an economic one. I'm white &amp; do it often. Also never SCAMMED anybody by "monkeying" up, an art perfected by mechanics. Also "monkey" around when in a good mood. üëéPC

@MichaelAvenatti @FatsDurston I'm banking on the idea,  this was part of what was farmed out to ny... that does not say Mueller doesn't have his own plans with it. Mueller will have to sit tight til Cohen done or destroy his own case. No different than judge ruling on Manafort's civil case. Chill...it'll come

Actually, no! Mueller's details must be a preserved  until he can prove what he finds, or everything falls flat. What Avenatti is able to disclose and force out, is based on his legal expertise. I love you Ed, but you don't know the law the way they do. https://t.co/daQEPwkqbx

OMG!! I really am not an ideologue,  but oh how I wish our nation could be in such harmony... and truly lead the effort to be a "new world order". Thank you Paula üòò https://t.co/iqiVMnzclc

@Banshee93 We have another thing in common...I too took care of my father a brief period before his passing.  Also my grandmother and great grandmother before her. I truly enjoyed my working career/educational life,  but the reward in caring for family is sooo much more rewarding!
@Banshee93 My apologies to you for misunderstanding,  thought I was getting called trolled again.  Only feelings of concern here are for McCain's family. And thank you for your advice. Maybe I made a friend after all, through all of this this negativity. üòâ stay good! And keep well.
@Banshee93 I take care of my family,  my daughter &amp; her newborn,  and my 4yr grandsons full time. I don't want to teach them that this type of language is ok! They need to be respectful,  but not rollover, &amp; respect themselves... not religious but firm believer in the Golden Rule.
@Banshee93 I agree,  that's why I followed the sciences and nat-geo. But I don't have any political preference... just what I think is right/wrong, both too extreme. Following few different voices to weedeat &amp; not get distorted. I'm open,  but some things really irk me,  like that t-shirt.
@Banshee93 @BeckyYo00780925 @washingtonpost Suffice it to say, I think we're on the same side of this one. I'm not the one wearing the t-shirt! Would never and will never.
@Banshee93 @BeckyYo00780925 @washingtonpost Hmmm,  so was mine, in regard to the t-shirt! But I am certainly no BOT. I'm only 5days in to this Twitter,  and all I see is this kind of crap. It's shameful,  makes me cringe.
@Banshee93 @BeckyYo00780925 @washingtonpost Maybe you shouldn't deliver what you don't want in return. Showing support for someone advertising "fuck you" to a dying man's wishes is just reprehensible. People have no shame,  nor dignity.  You call that making us great again? I call it downright disgusting!
@Banshee93 @BeckyYo00780925 @washingtonpost Further, the MAGA mantra has no business deciding anyone is "childish" for saying who they want w/their family and friends when they pass. Seems to me, they are the only ones inciting anything. CAN'T SPEAK NICELY,  DON'T SPEAK.
@Banshee93 @BeckyYo00780925 @washingtonpost Actually dear,  I'm just a grandma new to twit (no mistake) Twitter.  Because I have a life... does not mean I'm illiterate...I don't denounce anyone w/o cause or giving them due credit. My political irrelevant, but let's say I'm a realist, not an ideologue for either side.
@BeckyYo00780925 @Banshee93 @washingtonpost Lol.  Not
@thinkprogress Unfreaking believable! When did we enter such a twisted timewarp as to regress?
@EIonMusk0ffical Aren't you gonna ask if anyone is listening? Lol
@thehill Seriously?!? Would you want an antagonist at your funeral? Would you really want your loved ones to have to deal with the biggest FAKE sympathy? C'mon, this is common sense here. He's just setting boundaries that you know would get stomped on. Eek, this is iresome!! ü§®
@washingtonpost Mr Scott, your analysis is only propagating even more of the trumpists' inability to behave as civilized humans. Mr McCain's sentiments regarding his own funeral is precisely his, and that is assuredly his prerogative. We don't care what they think... and we no longer want to.
@BeckyYo00780925 @Banshee93 @washingtonpost You're disgraceful!!! You want to MAGA?!? I think NOT!
@realRKinVA @washingtonpost It's not bitterness, it's honesty that you have to let go of when you know you're leaving. And he has every right not to want someone at his own funeral that has been an antagonist in his lifetime. Maybe he doesn't want his loved ones to have to deal with FAKE sympathy.
@MarkDog227 @washingtonpost Boo. No f'n respect! Weak- minded and just have to be nasty. IF YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING NICE, DON'T SAY ANYTHING AT ALL!
@businessinsider Stunningly beautiful!!
@politico What's the deal? Just what has the DOJ/FBI done to potus?... nothing!  It's an open investingation..you are not supposed to receive anything yet! And who says they're done with h.c.? It's like asking for a cheat sheet and demanding an A. Just chill.
@michaeljohns @JoeNBC @POTUS @FordhamNYC @Wharton @Princeton I call BS. which is no more than his B.S. in econ from Wharton in '68, lol.  His other creds are "honorary" which is not an academically earned status.  You people need to do your own research when you want to be NOT FAKE! You really want to stand up for the man?... know reality
@FranBarreraReal @michaeljohns @JoeNBC @POTUS @FordhamNYC @Wharton @Princeton You have clearly never done your own research... he has only a B.S. in econ from Wharton. And his advanced degrees are all honorary ones from private religious schools (Jewish ones even). Are you aware of what an honorary degree even means?... it's NOT academically earned.
@CNBC Problem here is trump CAN'T approach anything as a rational adult.  His ideology on every EVERY issue is "shoot 1st, ask ?'s later". It's his responsibility to NEGOTIATE a fair deal (he is POTUS). Every parent knows "hardasses" don't win. Nobody says he should rollover, but damn!
@gnsthewind @CBSNews Dear,  you need to step outside of your "trump bubble" and get awakened to what is REALITY.  YOU dear, are ANTI- American. Get w/program &amp; THINK.  MAGA is showing the world that are intelligent enough to see through the deceits of any politician or media. BIAS is idiocracy.

@Peter06422186 @MSNBC Your avatar says it all! You are a perfect example of why there are so many trump-haters (besides the obvious to anyone with any iota of intelligence). Not all believers in the 2nd, walk around with an expression of constant disgust,  nor a mouth suited for the gutter.
@WowShell @MSNBC @PeterAlexander Too funny! LMFAO
@EdKrassen @FoxNews @TeamCavuto Thank you,  thank you!!!!		Quite possibly my faith in Fox has been restored.
@CBSNews @POTUS Shouldn't it be of greater importance that the president himself respect the office of the president?
