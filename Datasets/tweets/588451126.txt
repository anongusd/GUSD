@aj_pittam @realDonaldTrump Your "president" is setting the bar for bullying...in his tweets...intentionally dividing the Country...it seems.	A case of monkey see monkey do...if he cant handle the heat (or tweets), he needs to get out of the kitchen (stop tweeting).
@WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @JesseBWatters @greggutfeld "All eyes on American" ..hahaha..and what a JOKE it has been!!! Great entertainment for the world, only sorry for those that do not support that #rudedude!
@NotThatGreg @realDonaldTrump build a wall around half the Usa.put trumpville and his supporters in one half..leave other half open for "modernized people" who have values and morals and that want to move forward with the rest of the  world. And when they start shooting each other..they cant blame "illegials"
@VP @POTUS So if thousands were stopped...then Border patrol is doing their jobs, why the need to put up a monument...oops I mean a wall? Fund technology along with more personnel and tada!!! Way cheaper and effective. Imo
@realDonaldTrump I can see it now...a great big wall with a plaque installed stating "Trumpville" if your bad STAY OUT!!!	All to feed Mr. TRUMP's ego	Bahahaha...	FeelingSorry for the american people..praying that the American people can once again reunite and you can get a "real" president soon.
