@realDonaldTrump Mitch McConnell strongly supports the Mueller investigation AFTER he sat through the classified briefing last week. No one, including your shill Devin Nunes, talked about spies after the classified briefing. Why is that? #BitchHunt

@realDonaldTrump What the heck is the matter with you?  You are not normal (or even sane).  You can accuse Robert Mueller’s team of being Democrats, but more are Republican, an inconvenient truth. The FBI is apolitical and must remain so. No one believes you because you are a proven LIAR.
