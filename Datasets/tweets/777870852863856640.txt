@FashionCanada Interested in a follow up story on Breast Implant Associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma?? #biaalcl Number of cases is rising &amp; @US_FDA is not doing enough to warn patients, educate doctors, or push for banning of the textured surface implants in question. Please reach out.
@ECZLLP Researchers now say 560+ cases with at least 16 deaths. The @US_FDA needs to make another update. Would be even better if they would send a “letter to healthcare providers” as they did recently after 12 deaths from orogastric balloons for obesity. #breastimplantillness #biaalcl

@MFCcamwhore @PetualPer @Geekess92 @BruceBingo The FDA recognizes it, the ASPS and ASAPS have made joint statements, the World Health Organization recognizes it as a distinct entity, and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network has algorithms to diagnose and treat it. Although still rare, I can assure you that it’s real.
@DeevaLaDeeva 40,000+ sick women on FB support groups. We understand. #breastimplantillness #biaalcl
@MFCcamwhore @PetualPer @Geekess92 @BruceBingo Australia statistics are currently 1:6,000. Same for the Netherlands. The US says it could be 1:1,000 to 1:30,000. Number of cases is rising as women and surgeons are educated. In 2011, it was 1:300,000. That’s a big jump and we believe it will continue to rise.

@rtbosshardt Agree with that. We hear, though, that most often it’s reconstruction patients that need the textured device more. Is there true informed consent being given to these patients? Do they fully understand that the device they are using for cancer reconstruction can cause cancer?
@rtbosshardt That is our understanding. If this man-made device is inducing cancer, then why are textured still on the market? Why no black box warning? We hear everyday from women who have been implanted in the last couple of years and never warned.

@kerathink @JeanneLenzer Would love to hear @JeanneLenzer view on preemption and how it isn't required that patients be informed that they are being implanted with a Class III device; harmed patients have an extremely difficult time holding the manufacturer accountable. No check and balance.
@kerathink @JeanneLenzer You should get @DeviceEvents  on the phone to talk about the true numbers of harmed patients and accurate reports. She's also uncovered many deaths documented as "malfunctions".
@kerathink @JeanneLenzer I removed breast implants in 2015 due to illness. @BIVA_news now advocates for women and raises public awareness about Breast Implant Associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma. 30,000+ sick women on FB. Also support Medical Device Safety Act to overturn preemption on PMA devices.
@JeanneLenzer1 ...including devices like breast implants that were basically grandfathered in. Not even life saving devices. We are pushing for the Medical Device Safety Act to overturn preemption. Would love any support we can get. Currently in the House. (HR 2164).
@kerathink @JeanneLenzer1 Looking forward to reading this book! 30,000+ women on FB sick from their breast implants. Cases of Breast Implant Associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma on the rise by no talks by @US_FDA to remove textured implants from the market.

@Rachaelassasin Possibly. Mammograms don't image through the implants, only around them. Breast implants could possibly reduce the ability to visualize breast tissue completely. Mammograms are also less effective with dense breast tissue. MRI or ultrasound would be best.

We would love more radiological perspective on this disease; trying to build communication between disciplines. https://t.co/vXxbpYNRqm
@CBCNews It will continue to be rare as long as surgeons downplay the risk, deny testing, don't report. Other clinicians need to be aware of BIA-ALCL: ER docs, ob/gyn's, general care practitioners, oncologists, radiologists... It will take a bigger approach.
