@JenniferJJacobs #Proof_or_Poof
@JenniferJJacobs Does anybody ever ask for #Proof_or_Poof from prez that ANY of his policies have long range efficacy?	Why didn't prez do NAFTA in a classy, brainy way? Bringing our neighbor allies closer into a slightly adjusted #NAFTA, &amp; upping teamwork?	#VoteBlueToSaveAmerica 	@RichardHaass
@MEPFuller When the big act SMALL it gets ugly. 	The prez and surrounding enablers are looking small. The people involved w/admin are seeming smaller &amp; smaller as  ugly episodes &amp; accompanying ridiculous statements are a daily embarrassment across the nation/globe.	@MSNBC	@cnn @CNNPolitics

@crystalline_02 3 generations of McCains	distinguished naval service!		We must raise the bar for what we need in a president.		R.I.P. @SenJohnMcCain you still serve us as a "good example".		https://t.co/jpuLk2JvFl
@GOP The tax cut as constituted might wind up to be a big mistake.	Senators must go against aspects of a bill for the best outcome for the big picture. 	The "trickle down" usually stops just before it gets to the needy.	Tax cut is not middle class &amp; might bloat the deficit.	@CNN
@TeaPainUSA Just thought of something. 	Is this possible?	Censure 	THE NUTTY PREZFESSOR  retroactively, and if retro can negate his choice of nominees?	Pass this along to @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi 	for possibility!	@SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski 	@SenGillibrand @danabrams @JeffreyToobin
@TeaPainUSA We MUST raise the bar!	#EnlightenmentHeightenment	This admin is a worldwide joke, 	getting 'less' funny by the hour.	Admin fails on every key issue. Harming our real nat'l interests is NOT putting US first. When your motives are not pure, things flop. @CNN	@MSNBC @washingtonpost

@thehill @DemodogsandCats People that 	The Nutty Prezfessor praises had no qualms about harming YOUR children and OUR democracy!	If you were on stage at Helsinki with Putin what would you have said about the health of OUR children and YOUR democracy?	And then later to prez?	@CNN	#VoteBlue	RT tell them
@JRubinBlogger Obvious. They always fail/fib. Huge credibility gap is getting wider &amp; wider, like the gaps in the ice by the POLES.	Point this out at the POLLS.	#VoteBlueToSaveAmerica	Thank our earned lucky stars the US has resevoirs of knowledge, experience, fidelity, honor ready to steer.
@LibsInAmerica This happens when a pol party  gets ILL like current @gop.	Eccentrics, abusers, enablers of racism, sycophants, moneygrabbers, those of phony piety, conspiracy peddlers, lying right-wing broadcasters, influence peddlers, "machinationers" move in or up.	#VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
@JohnJHarwood And that began the economic recovery &amp; foundation of the current strong economy, built by @benbernanke, Paulson, Geitner, @BarackObama.	Current admin inherited a solid foundation. Beware of risky moves amid the bragging &amp; maga b/s, this is not #1950s when we EASILY dominated.
@JRubinBlogger Always a Dog &amp; Pony Show.	None of his ideas will pan out.	The ex-Mexican Pres Nieto KOed him multiple times, he cowtowed to Moscow, NK used him, XI red carpeted him, our best allies thinks he is a nut. The people who voted for this admin should be insulted.	He snookered you! @cnn
