So here's Trump pretty clearly referring to Rep. Omar, an immigrant, when saying some members of Congress hate the country. https://t.co/sSiIsFWN7f
Me before watching a political speech on the weekend / Me after watching a political speech on the weekend https://t.co/haiZactQmf
Just to be clear, he's obviously talking about Rep. Ilhan Omar, who was born in Somalia.
While talking about immigrants, he says "we have people right now in Congress who hate our country." Wants to ask them "how did they do in their country." 🤔
@PhilipRucker @daveweigel Does NOT fly private.
I know it's obviously amazing that Trump is still lying about the size of the crowd at his inauguration and that it's not even worth noting that it's amazing he's still talking about it but: It's amazing he's still talking about it.

There's been no prior indication that Stone had a connection to WikiLeaks this early, though this overlaps with the point at which Stone was contacted by a campaign official who'd been instructed to have him contact Assange.

Maybe there's more info out there! But the evidence we have doesn't suggest that Russia used Facebook to narrowly target specific groups with pointed messages in important areas right before the election.
We know what ads were bought as part of the Russian effort and where they were targeted.		Those ads were almost always broadly  targeted geographically and demographically. They were more common after the election than in the months immediately before. https://t.co/OP53Y728Lr
That means paid advertising. It's how Facebook makes its money, giving people/companies/campaigns the ability to do that.
One thing that seems to confuse people is what "targeted" means. 		If Russia had good information on messages that would convince very specific demographic groups in specific geographies, getting that message to those people means targeting them.
@warisill I'm not. "Targeted" means paid information aimed at a particular group. We have data on that.
@alexzfinley @emptywheel My article shows an example of what was likely shared.
@EnoIsGod @JustSchmeltzer @emptywheel "Followers" isn't targeted!
@EnoIsGod @JustSchmeltzer @emptywheel The interesting thing about that article is that it summarizes a report that actually shows how *little* targeting occurred. 	See:	https://t.co/htjlLNa8D1	to that point and	https://t.co/OP53Y728Lr	for an overall look.
@EnoIsGod @JustSchmeltzer @emptywheel I've looked at all of the ads that were released. There were times that there were specific ads targeting black voters in cities, but much of that targeting happened well before the election.
@mjmricci @emptywheel Honestly my guess is that Manafort is old school. I bet he can read cross-tabs but I bet he can't run queries.

Here's how the recent surge in apprehensions compares to the monthly peak in 2000. https://t.co/onWaVnIWnT https://t.co/WApDGZSf2X
Trump is going to point to a surge on the border in the last few months to declare a crisis -- and then propose a wall that will take years to build thanks to the speed of construction and inevitable legal fights. https://t.co/onWaVnIWnT
@manyspaceships Getting various responses like this. It's true that immigrants in the country illegally have committed crimes. It's untrue to say that they spur a surge in crime or commit more crimes than US citizens. So, especially since I don't know what he'll say, I'm not calling it a lie.
Trump will shortly link illegal immigration to crime. Here's why that link is so questionable. https://t.co/EUgaVeL3QV
@AaronBlake too low-brow
@AaronBlake no thank you
If you think about it, in a lot of ways Trump's desired solution to building a barrier on the border is at odds with his presentation and promises during the campaign.
@cmkoeb @PatBlanchfield @meganranney If you have data showing that murder rates for certain groups are in fact higher than they were 25 years ago, I'll happily include that in the article.
@meganranney @cmkoeb @PatBlanchfield Sure: https://t.co/giwmxuMFRJ
@cmkoeb @PatBlanchfield @meganranney No, I'm defending a perfectly valid point about understanding of gun violence. Is there a subset of people for which gun violence is now higher? Perhaps. But that wasn't the question at hand.		You want to defend a particular perspective. That doesn't undermine my piece.
@cmkoeb @PatBlanchfield @meganranney Again, that wasn't the question.
@felixsalmon One job as a human, one as a beetle.
@cmkoeb @PatBlanchfield @meganranney I don't disagree -- but that wasn't the question. Also, that graph doesn't extend back to the period at issue.
@colbyhall Given the flexibility given to the language surrounding impeachment, you're clearly right. 		For example: A president takes an oath to defend the Constitution. If a president were to refuse to do that, he'd be unable to perform his duties.

If your argument is that Russia decided to do only unmeasurable, indirect social-media targeting with their sophisticated data even while they were buying ads on Facebook anyway, well, I don't know what else to tell you.
@EverydayRegan Well, that's wrong? The "campaign" didn't transmit its data, it's not shown to have gotten to Russian intel agents and the meeting in Madrid was in 2017.

If you, too, have cross-referenced Russian Facebook ads with target states by month prior to the election and would then like to argue that there was a data-focused strategy deployed that depended on insights from the Trump campaign, OK. Let's debate. https://t.co/4L0VwTGpFN

This is where the Russian ads were targeted -- in 2015, 2016 and 2017. Does this look strategic? The only sub-state level targeting I've seen is by city, focused on Baltimore and Ferguson, not key 2016 places. https://t.co/L33FdesqaL

@GoksNews 1. If the document doesn't say what it is, the Times shouldn't speculate.	2. Could be, for example:	- data from an independent effort	- data stolen from the Dems 	- public data that Manafort though Kilimnik hadn't seen		Who knows?

Do I think there's plenty of evidence of Trump campaign figures willingly working with a Russian interference effort? Sure! Is this polling-sharing that? There's certainly reason to think it might not be.
@dana1981 stop trying to horn in on my gravy train
@mkindc @AaronBlake OK?
No, it's if Manafort was willingly collaborating with Russian intelligence which isn't necessarily demonstrated here. https://t.co/O6PWEUGm64
@stephendulaney Sure. But Trump's team didn't do much polling. And, regardless, the Times is making an assumption that's not warranted.

Could be lots of other "eithers," too, of course, but, you know.
Writing skeptical analyses is never a traffic bonanza, but either there was polling data shunted to Moscow where it ... wasn't really used? ... or Manafort was trying to puff himself up for Oleg Deripaska. https://t.co/IqSVWvZqk4

If your position is that no evidence of terrorist infiltration means massive unseen infiltration, the response is simple: Building a wall will just move that invisible infiltration to some other point as well.

@earlp1231 2?
@ScottPollak But these imaginary people who are infiltrating the country will get to a wall, stop and turn around? OK.
Worth noting on this: 	- Not everyone on the terror watch list is a terrorist or even necessarily linked to terrorism	- It's not clear how many of the six non-citizens/permanent residents were stopped between ports of entry -- places where the wall would prevent entry.
And here is how the claim presented to Congress about gang members compares. https://t.co/lBSWTw5lHz https://t.co/6FE8MeV0nT

I'm very sorry to do a thread to you and to resuscitate this. The end.
Again: There's already a distinction here. In-person voter fraud is vanishingly rare. Absentee fraud is something that experts have warned about for a while. Political debates over fraud focus on the former because those debates are generally about suppression, not actual fraud.
In other words, the "election fraud" line drawn here could readily apply to much of what Trump alleges, too. And by saying "election fraud exists; voter fraud doesn't," you do nothing to stymie insincere arguments about the issue.
Trump's lies about voter fraud would also necessitate an infrastructure that resembles what's alleged in NC. Getting people to apply for ballots and then filling them out for them differs little from voting at a polling place using a dead person's persona.
By insisting on fairly esoteric differentiations to use the term "election fraud" in lieu of "voter fraud", generally intended to allow people to continue to say voter fraud isn't a real threat, you open an unnecessary door.
I understand the impulse to want to differentiate NC's alleged fraud from what Trump talks about. There exists a distinction already: in-person vs. absentee voter fraud.
I am going to make a mistake and tweet about something that got a lot of negative feedback last week. But I still think it's right.

@DemFromCT @sethdmichaels @AaronBlake It isn't if you're talking about one dude casting one vote for a dead person. 		It's more subtle when you compare this to what Trump claims happens: A machine involving a strategic, pointed effort and multiple actors.
@DemFromCT @sethdmichaels @AaronBlake My point is largely that there is already a distinction drawn in descriptions of these activities and that this very subtle new distinction is both flawed and, I'd argued, often politically motivated.
@DemFromCT @sethdmichaels @AaronBlake "No fake ballots were cast; genuine ballots were stolen" is about as useful a distinction as has been drawn, but it's also incomplete. Voting illegally in the stead of an infrequent voter falls into which category?
@bafeldman he taught me it was ok to be weird as a kid
@sethdmichaels @AaronBlake To that point: https://t.co/PHuuGYRoQr
@sethdmichaels @AaronBlake This is the distinction that doesn't make sense!
@DevlinBarrett @AaronBlake The "voter" being robbed is the one being impersonated or losing his ballot. 		And there is a differentiation: In-person vs. absentee voter fraud. That already exists.
@DevlinBarrett @AaronBlake But you're conflating the two "voters," as Blake did.		The bad actor in each case is the arm of the machine: The person walking in to vote pretending to be you vs. the person taking your ballot and adding a vote you didn't want.

@StuntmanMike21 Speaking of football, you're moving the goalposts. You said they predicted he'd win. They didn't. The end.
@StuntmanMike21 No, they got the national vote margin largely right, indicating that Clinton would win the popular vote.
@DevlinBarrett @AaronBlake Sure! But that's not the debate. The debate isn't even over calling it "murder" or "suicide." It whether or not we should have different terms for being shot in the head or being shot in the chest. 		It's a linguistic debate!
@michaelmalice No, it's a way of establishing a benchmark to which generic-ballot polling can be compared, given that this is what such polling is meant to measure.

This NPR story appears to be wrong. It notes that Trump Jr. told a Senate committee that a deal in Moscow died of "deal fatigue" by 2014. 		But that was a deal with the Agalarovs. He was also asked if a deal was in the works in 2015/2016 and said yes.	https://t.co/B8SuolTfyK https://t.co/w34SamzXJF
