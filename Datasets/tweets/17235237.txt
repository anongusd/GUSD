@OneClassyStoner @I_am_meezus @PaulSorrentino3 I just got blocked by a liberal millennial  @I_am_meezus  because he couldn't make a good argument for democratic socialism!!   Why are millennials so thin skinned? And why can't they debate?  I did  save our entire conversation so I can go over it again!!!

@I_am_meezus Have fun living in your democratic socialism!!!  Don't call me for help to bail you out when it all goes sideways, I will not help, you will need to learn this life lesson on your own!!!
@I_am_meezus I proved you wrong, and that is what is pissing you off!!!  Buckle up BUTTERCUP if the "arguments" you put forth is all you have, you will be pissed for a very long time!!!
@I_am_meezus 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  It wouldn't be the first time someone blocked me because their ideology was wrong and I proved it!!!
@I_am_meezus Oh and by the way, that's why you politics will not end well for you!!!
@I_am_meezus Typical Millennial, can't debate, so you just swear and leave!!!
@I_am_meezus Memes and ad hominem attacks aren't "plenty" It seems you didn't read anything I posted, but I didn't expect you too. And I don't expect you to research India's socialism in the 50's
@I_am_meezus You just proved me right again, you don't know what a ad hominem attack is!!!
@I_am_meezus @emperorbjork2 Do some research on Mahatma Gandhi and India
@I_am_meezus "BTW putting 3 punctuations doesn't make your statement any more true!!!"  These extra punctuation are to point out to me when the other person doesn't have anything else to contribute to the debate!!!
@I_am_meezus @emperorbjork2 I just did
@I_am_meezus I just showed you what an ad hominem attack is and you still don't understand, looks like you are the troll!!!  🤣🤣🤣🤣
@I_am_meezus @emperorbjork2 Ok if you don't have a problem with history, why don't you answer my question about your democratic socialism failure that started around 1950!!  Afraid of the answer???
@I_am_meezus "you don't know anything" is an observation based on your answers not an attack!!!  Calling me a moron is a ad hominem attack!!!  Know the difference!!!
@I_am_meezus So now you are showing me you don't know what ad hominem attacks are!!!  Is there anything you do know???
@I_am_meezus @emperorbjork2 I gave you an answer, do you have a problem with comprehension???
@I_am_meezus @emperorbjork2 and you still havn't answered my history question, do you have a problem with history, or maybe you will not like what you find???
@I_am_meezus 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Ad hominem attacks aren't arguments, try again!!!

@I_am_meezus @emperorbjork2 All you are proving is the failure of our public indoctrination centres, where they don't teach critical thinking, just socialist ideas of envy and greed!!!
@I_am_meezus @emperorbjork2 did you even read the articles???
@I_am_meezus @emperorbjork2 Again, you can't live on SS alone. And again you keep saying things that aren't just so, Conservatives aren't afraid of good change, we just don't like failed ideas!!!  And again the Nordic example is not socialism, proven fact!!!
@I_am_meezus @emperorbjork2 You didn't even read them, you rejected them because of the source!!!  If the majority of Americans agree with you (something you haven't proved yet) they would be wrong!!!

@I_am_meezus @emperorbjork2 could've fooled me!!  What are you then???
@I_am_meezus @emperorbjork2 WRONG!!!  Is history really that hard for you???  I will give you another clue, they are in a shooting conflict with their neighbour right now!!!
@I_am_meezus @emperorbjork2 I have proven to you the the Nordic example is not socialism, but again you refuse to see it!!! Just how does socialism expand freedom and liberty??

@I_am_meezus @emperorbjork2 I'm not assuming anything, you keep proving your lack of knowledge on history and the constitution!!!  That is a sign of youth!!!
@I_am_meezus @emperorbjork2 Like all countries we have had problems, but we fixed the slavery problem!!  By the way it was your democrat party that wouldn't let go of the issue!!
@I_am_meezus @emperorbjork2 By the way you never answered which country has already tried your form of socialism. Is history to hard a subject for you???
@I_am_meezus @emperorbjork2 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 your to funny!!! I have no reason to be scared, because in the end freedom and liberty will win, and your democratic socialism will be on the ash heap of history!!  How does it feel to back a system that has been proven a failure throughout history???
@I_am_meezus @emperorbjork2 So socialism is compatible with freedom and liberty??? How so??  Or do you even know???  Freedom and liberty are not outdated ideas, they are what has made America a great country to live in!!!
@I_am_meezus Sigh!!! You prove with every tweet you don't know what you're talking about. You don't know what socialism really is, nor the limits the constitution places on your democratic socialism!!!
@I_am_meezus @emperorbjork2 Again you are not old enough to know that!!!

@OneClassyStoner @I_am_meezus @PaulSorrentino3 that's a good one!!!  🤣🤣🤣🤣
@I_am_meezus @OneClassyStoner @PaulSorrentino3 I have already proved it, you just don't except it, that's on you!!  Mostly what I see from you are memes with no sources cited!!!
@I_am_meezus @OneClassyStoner @PaulSorrentino3 Do some research, I'm not just going to give it too you!!!
@I_am_meezus @OneClassyStoner @PaulSorrentino3 Again do some research yourself Your Nordic examples are all market economies!!!
@I_am_meezus @OneClassyStoner @PaulSorrentino3 Reread my question, they started in the 50's, Venezuela didn't start until Chavez took over in the 1999.  Now come on exercise your history brain!!!
@I_am_meezus @PaulSorrentino3 @OneClassyStoner Riddle me this; if a sector of the economy doesn't not want to participate in you "democratic socialism" what is your remedy for this???
@I_am_meezus @OneClassyStoner @PaulSorrentino3 I find it hard to believe that young people are so gullible to believe that they have the answers to the nations woes, when they haven't even figured out who they are yet!!!
@I_am_meezus @OneClassyStoner @PaulSorrentino3 Your compassionate democratic socialism has been tried and it failed admissibly!!!  I will give you a clue they began the takeover in the 50's and the country suffered for 40 plus years!!  Guess which country that was???
@I_am_meezus @PaulSorrentino3 @OneClassyStoner Again you show you ignorance about what is or is not socialism!!!  Let me help you socialism/communism is the state control of the economy weather by law or gov confiscation!! Most of the things on the list have nothing to do with the economy!!!
@I_am_meezus @OneClassyStoner @PaulSorrentino3 You keep thinking that,we are not stuck in the past, we actually know history and learn from it!!!  Where as millennials don't know history and will repeat the mistakes of the past!!!
@I_am_meezus @OneClassyStoner @PaulSorrentino3 And what do you do if a sector of the economy will not go along with the mixed economy you like???
@I_am_meezus @OneClassyStoner @PaulSorrentino3 Well thought out comeback!!!
@I_am_meezus @OneClassyStoner @PaulSorrentino3 Yes lets adopt a much less mixed economy and a way more market economy, good idea!!!
@I_am_meezus @OneClassyStoner @PaulSorrentino3 You see the older folks get the wiser they become!!!   A young man who isn't a socialist hasn't got a heart; an old man who is a socialist hasn't got a head.
@I_am_meezus @OneClassyStoner @PaulSorrentino3 They do now with their market economies, not socialism!!
@I_am_meezus @OneClassyStoner @PaulSorrentino3 If you want people to get a better education, get the gov out of education!!  Our education system is screwed up because of gov!!! Yes it's greedy especially when your solutions have been proven not to work!!!
@I_am_meezus @OneClassyStoner @PaulSorrentino3 Who's fault is it??? You need to explain that one!!
@I_am_meezus @OneClassyStoner @PaulSorrentino3 the moral high ground?? There isn't anything moral about redistributing wealth!!! There is nothing moral about about forcing people into conforming to your ideology!!!
@I_am_meezus @OneClassyStoner @PaulSorrentino3 Instead of indoctrinating them in K-12, teach them to think for themselves, and stress more life skills! I went to school pre dept of education, so I received a true education!!!  Your greed and envy are showing!!!
@I_am_meezus @OneClassyStoner @PaulSorrentino3 Ok I will answer the question for you, maybe they aren't hired because they don't have any marketable skills and who's fault is that?? Not mine and not your's!!!
@I_am_meezus @OneClassyStoner @PaulSorrentino3 Good thing we are a Republic and not a democracy!!!  Doesn't matter what the majority want's if it isn't moral, or legal!!!
@I_am_meezus @OneClassyStoner @PaulSorrentino3 So your compassion is using gov to taking money from one group to give to another group??  That's not compassion, that's stealing and welfare!!!
@I_am_meezus @OneClassyStoner @PaulSorrentino3 that's not an answer!  Why wont they be hired???
@I_am_meezus @OneClassyStoner @PaulSorrentino3 It says a lot about the influences on your upbringing or the lack thereof!!! 	"I want to make sure the rich are paying enough to help out the rest of us."	What do you mean by help the rest of us???
@I_am_meezus @OneClassyStoner @PaulSorrentino3 Why is that not everyone can get a job???

I have worked for everything I have, and if it wasn't for the wealthy, I wouldn't have had jobs to do so!!  Your greed and envy is showing!!!
@I_am_meezus @OneClassyStoner @PaulSorrentino3 Who decides what is enough? The rich help us out everyday by creating jobs, and through that creating wealth with all the inputs that go into creating those jobs!!!  Gov can't do that, and poor people with out wealth can't do that! Again your greed for someone else money is big!
@I_am_meezus @OneClassyStoner @PaulSorrentino3 Why not, afraid of the truth!!!
@I_am_meezus @OneClassyStoner @PaulSorrentino3 Economic wise I'm and Austrian, and politically I'm a constitutionalist!!!  Mixed economies don't work, if they did we wouldn't be $22 trillion in debt as a nation with another $120 to $200 trillion in unfunded liabilities!!!
@I_am_meezus @OneClassyStoner @PaulSorrentino3 Could've fooled me!!!  You want capitalism because with out it there would be no wealth for the socialist to plunder!!!

@I_am_meezus When progressives pass programs so good that they have to use force to get folks to comply, that's less freedom!!!
@I_am_meezus I don't mind paying taxes that are for constitutional gov, but when progressives want to pass laws taking more money out of my pocket, that's less freedom, or passing laws saying what i can or can't do that have nothing to do with good gov, that's less freedom!!!
@I_am_meezus @PaulSorrentino3 Why is the progressive answer always more taxes???  Why not cut all unconstitutional spending let people keep more of what they earn and decide how they are going to spend their own money instead of folks like you deciding for them????

@Bigfarts420 @3_igma2 @I_am_meezus @PaulSorrentino3 Whatever you want to call it (baby) abortion ends a life!!!  Life begins at conception!!!
@Bigfarts420 @3_igma2 @I_am_meezus @PaulSorrentino3 We are never going to see eye to eye on this issue!!!  I choose to protect life and you choose to support the destroying of it!!!
@Bigfarts420 @3_igma2 @I_am_meezus @PaulSorrentino3 You read a lot into things that isn't there!!!  You're pro choice??  Just make better choices, and if you don't, live with the consequences!!!  Killing the baby who is inocent should never be a choice!!
@Bigfarts420 @3_igma2 @I_am_meezus @PaulSorrentino3 Just because it's the law doesn't make it right or moral!!!  The "fetus" baby is not part of the woman body, don't you know basic anatomy??  It's a separate body from the woman's!!!
@Bigfarts420 @3_igma2 @I_am_meezus @PaulSorrentino3 When over 92% of abortions are for the convenience of the mother, that's evil!!!  They can make better choices before they get pregnant!!!
@Bigfarts420 @3_igma2 @I_am_meezus @PaulSorrentino3 Abortion is not healthy for either the mother or the child!!!  It's not about control, it's about protecting the rights to life for the unborn child!!!  A child is a child born or unborn!!!  I have noticed those who support abortion, have already been born!!!
@Bigfarts420 @3_igma2 @I_am_meezus @PaulSorrentino3 Quit showing your ignorance!!!  You don't know me or mine!!  I love our 2 children and financially support a couple of children adoption agencies, and a home that helps pregnant women with birth and whatever else they need!!!
@Bigfarts420 @3_igma2 @I_am_meezus @PaulSorrentino3 I have never heard a woman refer to her fetus she is carrying!!  It's always baby or child!!!  The only reason to use the term fetus is to dehumanize the baby for abortion!!!

@Bigfarts420 @I_am_meezus @3_igma2 @PaulSorrentino3 So I need or want something I'm entitled to it???
@Bigfarts420 @3_igma2 @I_am_meezus @PaulSorrentino3 When did I say it wasn't???
@Fox_Mulder_8 @3_igma2 @I_am_meezus @PaulSorrentino3 That is because congress has abdicated it's responsibility for money and political expedience!!!
@Bigfarts420 @3_igma2 @I_am_meezus @PaulSorrentino3 Been living that way all my life!!!  How many times have federal inspectors failed the public???
@Bigfarts420 @3_igma2 @I_am_meezus @PaulSorrentino3 Where do you think the federal tax on a gallon of fuel is for!!  Gov can't spend money without first taking it in the form of taxes, printing, or borrowing the money!!!
@Fox_Mulder_8 @I_am_meezus @3_igma2 @PaulSorrentino3 Congress has abdicated it's responsibility for political expedience, which is unconstitutional!!!  Then you've abdicated your responsibility as a citizen!!!
@I_am_meezus @Bigfarts420 @3_igma2 @PaulSorrentino3 SSI disability is not insurance it's an entitlement!!!
@Fox_Mulder_8 @3_igma2 @I_am_meezus @PaulSorrentino3 please show me where health care is in the constitution???  And by the way the Bill of Rights is and the amendments are part of the constitution.
@Fox_Mulder_8 @3_igma2 @I_am_meezus @PaulSorrentino3 still waiting for the total IG report.  Can you explain it???
@Bigfarts420 @3_igma2 @I_am_meezus @PaulSorrentino3 Not all taxes are theft just the unconstitutional ones!!!
@PaulSorrentino3 @I_am_meezus @3_igma2 That is a thoughtful and insightful argument!!!
@Bigfarts420 @3_igma2 @I_am_meezus @PaulSorrentino3 I pay for the roads I travel on with every gallon of fuel I buy, Most of the food I have in my freezer wasn't inspected, We practice the 2nd amendment, I have a well, the FDA has killed a lot of people, Capitalism paid for all these things, socialism doesn't create anything!!!
@Bigfarts420 @3_igma2 @I_am_meezus @PaulSorrentino3 Yes it was wrong of Obama to blow up weddings!!!  My wife and I have health insurance and food on the table because we have incomes!!!  Am I wrong for working for what I have???
@I_am_meezus @Fox_Mulder_8 @3_igma2 @PaulSorrentino3 That would be the proper way to do it, by amending the constitution, not just a tyrannical mandate!!!

@Bigfarts420 @3_igma2 @I_am_meezus @PaulSorrentino3 Unconstitutional taxes are theft!!  And we have quite a few unconstitutional agencies that are tax dollars go to fund!!!
@I_am_meezus @3_igma2 @PaulSorrentino3 I bet you want it so I can't opt out!!!  Why should our tax dollars pay for someone who makes bad life choices that harm their health???

@I_am_meezus @PaulSorrentino3 @3_igma2 Because someone is selling their labor to provide healthcare, shouldn't they get paid for their labor???

@I_am_meezus @PaulSorrentino3 @3_igma2 That still doesn't tell us how it's a right!!  Just because you can't afford something doesn't make it a right!!!  The problem isn't health care or the lack thereof, the problem is gov overreach, and lack of economic opportunities so folks can buy their own healthcare!
@I_am_meezus @3_igma2 Any tax that is above and beyond the U.S. Constitution, or state constitutions enumerated powers is theft!!!  Read your constitutions!!!
@PaulSorrentino3 @I_am_meezus @3_igma2 The article says it's a right, but not how is it a right!!!  Why don't you the a crack at it!!!
@I_am_meezus @3_igma2 You don't have a right to someone else's labor!!! If I provide a service you don't have a right to steal it, or force others to pay for it!!!  The idea that you're ok with theft speaks volumes about your morals, or lack there of!!!
@I_am_meezus @3_igma2 I never said there would be a shortage, I put forth a hypothetical to prove a point! You just proved my point that health care can't be a right!!  You have a right to trade your Labour for the benefit of insurance to pay for your health care!

@IsForIndividual @feeonline The only thing I'm learning is you really hate corporations, and don't understand how the formation of them works and happens!  I have taken this a far as I'm willing, have a good life!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
@IsForIndividual @feeonline 1 you need to look up the definition of ad hominem		2 some human or group of humans put those policies in place, they just didn't appear out of thin air! And for a company to be relevant and affective in the market place they 're-examine them often!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline Oh an BOOM!!!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline That means my business liability through insurance or an LLC can only be used for the business!  If I have a personal liability outside of business, I would need separate liability like home owners to cover that, still not socializing the loss!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline As far as I know you as an individual can have however much liability insurance as you can afford, same as a corporation. That's not what the "limited liability" stands for in an LLC! Any liabilities realized and covered by insurance is limited to the business!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline You don't think LLC's have to carry liability insurance? You have a degree in what?	When I owned my own log truck it cost me $1500 a year for a million $ liability policy. I'm told if you can afford the premiums, you can have as much liability insurance as you want!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline Individuals do have recourse in protecting personal assets, it's called bankruptcy.
@IsForIndividual @feeonline If I have business losses, and they are bad enough I could loose all of my business assets to cover the losses. How is that socialism?
@IsForIndividual @feeonline Again if you have an accounting degree you know that creating and maintaining a LLC isn't free! Protecting my personal assets from business losses is not socializing my business losses!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline Again you're stating something that is not in evidence and in dispute! Individuals coming together to form a corporation is in no way a fiat! The gov didn't order the corporation into existence, it just recognised the filing of the articles!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline So corporations can't be sued?
@IsForIndividual @feeonline People who run corporations make decisions everyday based on market demand, they would go out of business otherwise!  Robots using people, I came get over how ridiculous that idea is!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline If you have degrees in both business and accounting, no offense but it doesn't show up in your arguments!  "Robots using people" your making my point about your degrees! Corporations that are just in paper without humans are lifeless and can't control people!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline Again I don't see how protecting assets are free! It cost money to set up a corporation to separate assets and there is no expense to the public! Even an individual can get a lawyer to try to protect their personal assets from business loss!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline So limiting liability is somehow socialistic? Again calling something a fiat over and over ad nauseam doesn't make it true! Individual business folks do all they can to limit their liability everyday, so that is socialism? Wow just Wow!!!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline If you keep going around in a circle long enough you will catch your own tail! Again gov doesn't create corporations, individuals do through contracts.
@IsForIndividual @feeonline What about partnerships and co-operatives? I have been apart of both types and we still needed to "file" paperwork with the state to let them know we were doing business within the state, just like articles of incorporation! No permission was ever ask, we just told them!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline Filing something is not the same as the place where it is filed creating what is filed. If you go to a lawyer and pay him or her to draw up the articles ie contract, what did the state create? Nothing they are just the deposit of the filing and created nothing!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline So if your car is broken you just junk it because you don't know either how to fix it or know where to take it to get fixed, got it!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline Sorry I'm not committing a rhetorical fallacy by ask you how you would do something, and it's not a trap either. It's just a question you can't seem to answer, or don't want to!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline That's the point it's very relevant! The terms you use only apply to crony capitalism, and those individuals living off the special rights, socialistic, welfare state! Not every corporation is corrupt as you wish they were!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline You don't seem to understand how business works, individually owned or corporate. Corporations are made up of humans who run and operate them, you make it sound like they run themselves with humans at all! Wow just Wow!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline Corporations just like individuals, set a price that the market will bare and is competitive! No body and I do mean nobody can be forced to buy from any individual or corporations! Black mail under pay isn't even an economic term!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline Let me clarify, for the individual the negotiations take place through competition of choice! You don't go to the gas attendant and hagel about price.
@IsForIndividual @feeonline I never said that I was using the state, you are assuming that's the case when it is not!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline If a business losses in the market place, there should never be a gov bailout period, that would be socialising losses. Stopping the losing of assets at the business level and keeping your personal assets intact through contract law is not socialism!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline You misunderstand protecting assets and you have throughout this whole discourse! I never said or meant "socialize losses" you assumed it. I have always been talking about protecting personal assets from a business loss. That can only be done through contract law!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline That assuming that corporations are gov born but you haven't proven it, you just keep repeating the term!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline If the shoe fits wear it! Again you have no idea how to separate personal from business assets without a binding contract!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline Not every corporation acts the way you describe! All and I do mean all corporations started out as entrepreneurial endeavors. Not all corporations practice crony capitalism as you imply they do!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline I agree, but those responsible for them can! Besides your the one giving them human or animal attributes!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline Not every transaction is a negotiation! Do you negotiate the price of your gas, electricity, food at the grocery store? Individuals can't, but a business can just because of the volume they use. Some wages can be negotiated and some can't!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline Why if I become part of a contract do you think I'm entitled? You just keep going around in circles! I have every right to separate personal and business assets and protect them both! You just don't like the fact that someone uses contract law to do it!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline I personally don't believe in a minimum wage because it destroys jobs and does nothing to improve the lives of those seeking it.  The market should set the minimum wage, not some politicians trying to score votes!!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline Repeating words without explaining them is not an answer, it's just a regurgitation of words and terms!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline I didn't ask you to solve a problem I don't have! I ask how you would protect your personal assets from a business loss, but I guess you have no clue how you would! Fact is you couldn't with contract law to separate the two!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline And if corporations are disconnected from there customers, vendors, and employees they don't stay in business long and can't force anybody to do anything! Problem solved and no amount of statism can prevent that!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline I know a few business executives that would disagree with you about being jailed. Corporations die everyday! The illness they suffer is poor management and gov over regulation. Folks die everyday in corporations and have to replaced.
@IsForIndividual @feeonline Why would an individual need an LLC if they are not in business? What liability would an individual have to protect themselves against? You still haven't explained what anyone is negotiating?
@IsForIndividual @feeonline Again you are running in circles but never arriving at a point! How do you protect your individual assets from a business loss you incurred, please answer!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline I have yet to see a logical argument from you!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline It's all connected, you just can't see it!!!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline I used the word deserve to signify that if I worked for something I have a right to keep it and protect  what I have worked for through contract law, I deserve the fruits of my labors! If I need up in business and make mistakes I deserve to lose my business!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline You totally missed my point earlier, when I say protect one of my assets from another of my assets, that doesn't take gov that takes contract law! Setting up an LLC is contract law! That's the part you don't get! You still haven't explained how you as an individual protect assets
@IsForIndividual @feeonline Do you know how to make a coherent argument, or do you just like to regurgitate the same things over and over again?
@IsForIndividual @feeonline Again you sound like a broken record, and saying those things ad nauseam doesn't make them true.
@IsForIndividual @feeonline You keep calling it welfare, socialism, and special rights but never explain what you mean! So your telling me you would never take someone to court because they broke a contract with you? There is nothing free about protecting my assets, FACT!!!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline You keep talking about an "unfair advantage" I may have over someone else. But you never explain what I have and can get under contract law that someone else can't !!!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline Again how do you protect your assets without some kind of state involvement as an individual?
@IsForIndividual @feeonline It's called contract law, which is capitalism 101, which you don't seem to grasp! You don't even understand what corporatism is, but you accuse me of it. The courts through contract law protect my assets!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline "New separate beast" your words not mine! An LLC is not a beast anymore than it is human! Incorporate are not some statist beast out to gobble up the world!!!  You have such erroneous ideas you don't know which direction to go!!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline You have yet to explain how you as an individual protect yourself from business loss!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline Calling me a statist when my arguments and statements suggest otherwise is disingenuous! If I earned what I have worked for, I deserve to keep them by not having them looted by gov or individuals! Protecting what I earn and have by incorporation is capitalism 101!!!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline So by this reasoning you confess you don't understand a logical argument!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline You can't even see the errors in your own arguments, amazing!!!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline Do even understand what I'm saying????
@IsForIndividual @feeonline It all goes back to my point, corporations are not gov, they never have and never will be!!! Who has the power of the people's purse? Who has the power over immigration? Who has the power to declare war, lay taxes and tariffs? Not corporations, but the government!!!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline A non incorporated partnership can negotiate better deals than an individual business owner because of the division of labor, should partnerships be outlawed to? Corporations face more risk every day that an individual business owner never does!!!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline Bull!! If you're doing business as an individual, don't you have insurance? Insurance that in many states is mandated and at what levels you need!!! Negotiate for what? Market share? Cheaper raw materials or product because they can buy in bulk?
@IsForIndividual @feeonline And if forming a business, setting terms and conditions and informing a state that you are incorporating is somehow a special right, which it is not because anyone that wants to can, And isn't somehow free market economics, which it is, then we need to revamp contract law!!!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline If you want to do that, ok I don't care. But for you to malign me or anyone else from getting together and forming a business by calling it welfare which it is not, socialism which it's not, is undermining what capitalism and freedom of association represent!!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline Especially if the loss was because of a frivolous lawsuit that had no validity, but a judge ruled against you anyway? (McDonald's Florida hot coffee in the lap lawsuit) Corp are not fiat born beast, they are contracts plain and simple!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline If I'm in business, should I have to expose my personal assets for a business loss determined by a third party? NO I SHOULDN'T!!! If we had a partnership should we both have to forfeit personal property for the greed of another?
@IsForIndividual @feeonline And the ones who still had a home to go to, we're the ones who protected their personal assets by being incorporated. Again it's not a handout, because most had liability insurance by state law, but some states award civil judgments that exceed the insurance coverage!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline To want to protect both personal and business assets from each other is also capitalism 101. I have seen in the trucking industry where a truck was involved in an accident, was cleared of any responsibility under criminal law, but was sued in civil court and lost everything!!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline By your logic, I can't have insurance to cover any loss either! That would be unfair if I can afford it and you can't! It's not a handout either, I paid for the assets through hard work and investing back into the business with my profits, that's capitalism 101!!!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline I work for my LLC, and draw a salary when I can as long as profits permit. My LLC only faces risks created by my business. Why can't I protect my personal assets from a business loss? That's not welfare, socialism, or special rights!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline Incorporation does not violate freedom, liberty, rights or our property rights! It enhances them! There is nothing wrong with wanting to protect and separate personal and business property! If you believe there is there is something wrong in your thinking.
@IsForIndividual @feeonline Who creates law in a Republic? The answer is our elected representatives! As long as the law doesn't violate our natural rights (and many local, state, and federal laws do) and protects our freedom, liberty and rights it may be a good law.
@IsForIndividual @feeonline If individuals can create government and give it (enumerate) powers, then by your own logic they are "FIAT" also! Governments don't have natural rights yet you are ok with them being created!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline A handout from whom? Welfare, special rights, and socialism from whom? So if you and I form a business through a contract, I don't deserve to have my assets protected from dumb decisions you might make or outright theft you might commit?
@IsForIndividual @feeonline A contract to form a business, it's no longer just individuals anymore it's something more, and contract law recognizes this. That was the example I gave.
@IsForIndividual @feeonline As was stated earlier, if the citizens of a state want to amend the state constitution to allow the state to create corporations, (which they don't now) then the state would have the constitutional authority to do so, why is that so hard to comprehend?
@IsForIndividual @feeonline As an individual according to your logic, I can't form an LLC to separate personal and business assets to protect both from each other? How is an LLC gov?
@IsForIndividual @feeonline So if you and I sign a contract to form a business we are big gov now? If I go into business with you without a contract, how do I protect my assets from any wrong doing you might do? Answer I can't without a contract that sets and defines terms!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline Please explain how corporations are gov?  Again another libertarian purist term.  Corp can't force me or you to do anything. I don't buy GM or Chrysler products because of them taking tarp money illegally. Can either force me to buy their products? No
@IsForIndividual @feeonline That's the problem with America today!!!  Being mostly on the same page is like saying a woman is a little pregnant, either you are or you're not there is no inbetween. Either the Fed gov created the states or the states created the Fed gov there is no inbetween!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline If folks would bother to read the several States constitutions, I have read quite a few but not all, they also recognise our rights and place protections on them.  The states are to protect our rights from violations of Fed or other States abuses of our rights!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline They are not "constitutional" rights, that implies they are granted by gov, and they are not. We have natural rights as individuals that precede any gov that ever existed. The BOR is stating rights we already had, and putting restrictions on all gov, but specifically fed gov!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline Read art 4 section 4 more carefully, "United States" that means every other state not the " federal gov" guarantees every State in this union a Republican form of gov.
@IsForIndividual @feeonline The constitution didn't establish the states, art 4 section 4 is a guarantee the states inserted into the Constitution!!!  The constitution never created a state, it only recognized them after they were formed and filed for statehood!!!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline I don't want states regulating the economy either, I just want them to enforce contract law!!!  If I enter into a contract with you, my right's nor your rights are forfeit. I never advocated for group rights, but individuals acting as a group still have rights!!!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline Yes there is a limit on the states by the people, however that limit can be raised or lowered by the people of the state amending the states constitution. What some states in the union are doing is usurping the authority of the people and violating state constitution!!!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline And I said I reject number one of the definition as a way to run a state, but number 2 is valid.  In America the power pyramid is this the sovereign individual 1st, the sovereignty of the seven states 2nd, and the least powerful is the federal gov, Federalism!!!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline I don't believe in number 1, states should protect the freedom and liberty of the individuals in that state.  However if individuals in a state are dumb enough to grant the state gov unlimited powers or to lazy to stop the state from usurping those powers it on them!!!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline statism [stey-tiz-uh m] 		1 noun; the principle or policy of concentrating extensive economic, political, and related controls in the state at the cost of individual liberty.		2 support of or belief in the sovereignty of a state,usually a republic.
@IsForIndividual @feeonline I reject your term of state statism.
@IsForIndividual @feeonline The federal gov didn't create the states!!!  The U.S.Constitution is only supreme in the powers granted to it by the states!!!  All other powers are reserved to the States or the people, 9th and 10th amendments
@IsForIndividual @feeonline No I'm a constitutionalist who believes in federalism, the several States that created and ratified the Constitution created the federal gov. Not the other way around. All 50 states have a state constitution they are suppose to adhere to.
@IsForIndividual @feeonline If your not a "libertarian purist" quit using their terms and ideas!!!  The U.S. Constitution does not authorize or enumerate powers for the federal gov to be involved with corporations, however there are no such restrictions on the several States!!!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline So by your logic if individuals form corporations, the individuals that formed the corporations cease to have rights as a group?  If the citizens of a state enumerate a power for the state then they have the authority to exercise that power.
@IsForIndividual @feeonline As I said before and I will state again, you don't want gov in any way, shape or form, which means you're a libertarian purist.  Your own words and thoughts betray you. I have debated your kind before and you keep going in circles because you have no argument, no case!!!
@IsForIndividual @feeonline Let me be as plain spoken as I can be so you can follow along; federal gov no, state gov yes on a limited bases!!!

@IsForIndividual @feeonline As an individual that has an LLC, my right's as an individual don't go away and in some instances extend to the LLC. Corporations are not individuals in and of themselves, but are made up of individuals who have natural rights that should be protected
@IsForIndividual @feeonline If states do not restrict individuals from forming corporations to do business then corporations are ok. Corporations do not run themselves, they need us humans to run them.
@IsForIndividual @feeonline I did answer it, the U.S. Constitution does not enumerate any powers for the federal gov to be involved in the economy.  However that same restriction does not extend to the several States who created the federal gov.
@IsForIndividual @feeonline You need to distinguish and define who big gov is.  When I hear the term I think of the federal gov not the states. You're laboring under a logical fallacy of a corporation being a separate entity that is created without humans or controlled by the humans that created it.
@IsForIndividual @feeonline The state or commonwealth has nothing to do with the actual articles of incorporation that you and a lawyer draw up.  When I created my LLC years ago I went to Legal Zoom bought the papers I needed filled them out and filed them, that was it. My LLC is just a number to the state
@IsForIndividual @feeonline In PA the creation of a corporation is done when the contract is drawn up by the individual or group of individuals, and then filed for notification that the business is operating in the state of commonwealth.
@IsForIndividual @feeonline You need to define big gov?
@IsForIndividual @feeonline All corporations are, is a contract between individuals or by individuals with their customers.  Federal gov has no authority to create or support corporations in any way. States if allowed by the state constitution can regulate how business operates within the state.
@IsForIndividual @feeonline The constitution does not allow the federal gov to do anything in the economy except to make commerce regular between the states!!!  However individual states can and do regulate commerce within their states unless the folks of that state doesn't allow them.

@IsForIndividual @feeonline PA didn't grant me anything, all they did was accept my filing that I was an LLC and was going to do business under that LLC.  There was no return paperwork that stated any grant from the gov!!!  Go raise money for your business without Corp paperwork see how far you get!!!

@IsForIndividual @feeonline A proper defense of corporations must stress that they are created and sustained by freedom of association and contract, that the source of freedom is not governmental permission but individual rights, and that these rights are not suddenly forfeited when
@IsForIndividual @feeonline One of the protections of corporations is to protect personal assets from lawsuits, especially frivolous ones.  Sorry there are corporations who practice free market capitalism and there some who are crony capitalist quit conflating the 2!!!

@marcyrw @bakumshakum @letamericavote No I'm talking about natural rights that existed before government, and John Locke explains it very well in his 2nd treaties on government. Blackstone talks a lot about the law and rights also
@bakumshakum @marcyrw @letamericavote The Bill of Rights can't grant rights we already had before it was added to the Constitution. You need to read John Locke and his view on natural rights.
@marcyrw @bakumshakum @letamericavote I don't live in a "virtual" world.  There is no reasoning with regressive liberals!  I give credit where credit is due, doesn't mean I support him!
@bakumshakum @marcyrw @letamericavote If you rely on a grant from government to practice something then it is not a right but a privilege extended by the government!  The Bill of Rights do not grant rights, they protect our rights from government abuse!
@marcyrw @bakumshakum @letamericavote Funny how your failed argument ended with me being a Trumpist.  I didn't vote for him and only support him when he is right.

RT @feeonline: If tariffs made citizens better off, shouldn’t California want to restrict trade with Maine? https://t.co/b3mdVomyLO
@bakumshakum @letamericavote Yes democrats have been disenfranchising Americans for a long time!!!!
@bakumshakum @letamericavote Your forgetting about rights being removed because of a conviction of a felony
@bakumshakum @letamericavote The architects of the NVRA happened under Democrat administrations.
@bakumshakum @letamericavote According to the NVRA  it does, go read it.
@bakumshakum @letamericavote 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
@bakumshakum @letamericavote If you are talking about the Ohio case that went before the SCOTUS, Ohio followed the law as written, and not how you want it to be. I'm doing more research in GA, but from my initial research GA is following the NVRA as written, unless you can prove otherwise.
@bakumshakum @letamericavote They are not purges, it's voter roll clean up.  Name the case or state that is not based on the NVRA?  My point with the drivers license is you must act to continue driving, just like you must act to continue voting see my point???
@bakumshakum @letamericavote American citizens disenfranchised themselves when the don't keep up with the requirements of voting!!!  I don't understand why you don't get this point!!  If you don't go into the DMV to renew your drivers license and it expires who's fault is it???
Only freedom tempered liberty can lift individuals out of poverty!!! https://t.co/ZYoqJsMmuk
@bakumshakum @letamericavote Yes the founders and framers set in place a system that would maximise freedom and liberty.  Not everyone benefited right away, but as I said our Constitutional representative Republic continues to iron out the situations you think we still suffer from!!!
@bakumshakum @letamericavote I'm not avoiding the question, you just don't like my answers.  The framers knew that the constitution was not perfect that's why they placed article V in the constitution by a unanimous vote!!!  Do you even know American history??? Or constitutional history???
@bakumshakum @letamericavote The democrats are the "team" .  If the NVRA is applied without bias, then it would apply to all political persuasions. You really seem not to follow this issue much, your just spouting rhetoric. I do care about the rule of law, we are a nation of laws not men!!!
@Atomlinson44 @letamericavote Donor favors plague both major political parties.   I guess I'm just old fashion and think folks have a responsibility if they want to exercise their rights and be active, not just wait to be handed things!!!
can he survive this???	#FoxNews https://t.co/MyIQI0NTJj
@bakumshakum @letamericavote I'm talking about a Republic that ironed out all these issues, that's why the founders and framers created a Republic instead of a democracy!!!  You really need to go and study the difference between the two!!!
@bakumshakum @letamericavote Your ignorance is showing!!!  Very few of the founders and framers supported slavery.  Counting slaves as 3/5 a person was to put a check in slave owners power in congress.
@bakumshakum @letamericavote If you didn't vote for the required period of time and where cleaned from the rolls, the voter disenfranchised themselves, there fault not the states!!!  You stating it affects POC, is racist!!!  So POC can't figure out how to follow the law???
@bakumshakum @letamericavote I'm a member of the Constitution party, what team are you talking about???  So following the law is a bad thing now???
@gardenman0913 @letamericavote So your saying a citizen bears no responsibility to remain eligible to vote???
@gardenman0913 @letamericavote I did not say annual registration and the NVRA doesn't say that either!!!  Read the law before you come here and comment on a situation you seem to know very little about!!!
@gardenman0913 @letamericavote Define where you put the line to keep voter roles clean???  Sounds to me you don't want them clean and up to date!!!
@bakumshakum @letamericavote And you don't care about the rule of law and citizenship!!!  I'm not a member of either political party, too many crooks in both parties!!!  I'm a constitutional conservative and I'm pro republic and anti democracy just like the founders and framers!!!
@bakumshakum @letamericavote Did you even read the NVRA???  If as a voter you were too lazy to keep up with the requirements of voting, you can still vote provisionally!!!  By law the voter roll was cleaned lawfully!!!
@Atomlinson44 @letamericavote So you don't think there should be any effort on the part of the citizen to make sure they are in good standing to vote???
@bakumshakum @letamericavote So you know for a fact that no republican cares about fairness???  I'm neither a republican or a democrat but from what I have researched most never Trumpets were not principled at all!!  Pray tell how is cleaning up voter rolls rigging the game???
@bakumshakum @letamericavote So what!!!  Did the GA state government break the NVRA in cleaning up the voter roles??  If not then all is good!!!
@gardenman0913 @letamericavote I agree the republicans and democrats are liars and deceitful, I'm glad I'm not either!!!  It just wasn't dems who were purged.  Keeping voter rolls clean and up to date should be a priority for every American!!!
@gardenman0913 @letamericavote Citizenship take a little effort on the part of the citizen!!!  Don't blame the state for the laziness of the citizens!!!
@Atomlinson44 @letamericavote Then change the law!!!  It's not a bad law, you just don't like having to work at exercising your rights!!!  Regressive democrats are law breakers and lazy citizens!!!
@gardenman0913 @letamericavote And you know for a fact the voters were not notified, or that the state didn't try to notify them per the requirements of the NVRA????
@Barbara60117444 Who skipped voting and the state went through the process prescribed by the law!!!  Either we follow the law or we don't!!!  If people cared as much as you think they do about voting they wouldn't have skipped voting!!!
@FakePrezTrump @letamericavote Read all of the law, it gives specific directions on when to purge and how to go about it!!!  You can't pick and choose which part of the law you want to follow!!!
@Atomlinson44 @letamericavote So you're saying the law doesn't matter???  And you don't care if voter rolls have names on them that haven't voted in years???

@laurafish1 @Tit4tat11 @IndivisibleTeam when I didn't have insurance, I paid for my basic care out of pocket, that didn't cost you a thing
@laurafish1 @Tit4tat11 @IndivisibleTeam yes through the commerce clause of the US Constitution, states stopping citizens from buying across state lines is unconstitutional
@AlexCre8tive @laurafish1 @IndivisibleTeam My wife and I chose not to have insurance until we decided to have children, my not having insurance b4 didn't raise anyone's cost
@Tit4tat11 @laurafish1 @IndivisibleTeam please go study some basic economics, regulations make things cost more, competition makes them cost less
@Tit4tat11 @laurafish1 @IndivisibleTeam your not smart enough not to buy junk insurance?
@Tit4tat11 @laurafish1 @IndivisibleTeam not up to insurance companies, we the people can change the law about buying insurance across state lines
@Tit4tat11 @laurafish1 @IndivisibleTeam your conflating health insurance with health care cost.  The reason both cost too much is lack of competition n too much gov regulation
@Tit4tat11 @laurafish1 @IndivisibleTeam they did that because of gov regulations were causing the problem of cost and availability.  When I didn't have insurance I still went to dr
@Tit4tat11 @IndivisibleTeam which were being covered under most state laws
@laurafish1 @Tit4tat11 @IndivisibleTeam allowing the people the freedom of choice is at issue and you want to use force to make people conform to your ideas which is not freedom!
@laurafish1 @Tit4tat11 @IndivisibleTeam that should be between you and the insurance company, with out gov involvement. you can get basic care without insurance, it's just harder
@laurafish1 @Tit4tat11 @IndivisibleTeam So forcing people to do things against their will is your answer?
@laurafish1 @Tit4tat11 @IndivisibleTeam I never said they shouldn't have it, I said they shouldn't be forced to buy it.  It should be a personal choice. just a question of freedom
@Tit4tat11 @IndivisibleTeam one of the things no one is talking about is the states still have their health care laws on the books, and through repeal,states take over
@Tit4tat11 @IndivisibleTeam Those who still support the failed Obamacare are the ones who are lying to folks about who would loose coverage.
@Tit4tat11 @IndivisibleTeam but you are getting your facts wrong, the 24 million that we are talking about are young millennials who are healthy, but were forced on
Well said https://t.co/vZTJqi8V7w

@Tit4tat11 @IndivisibleTeam what does that matter?
@IndivisibleTeam Do you mean the 24 million who were forced onto Obamacare by the IRS in the 1st place?

@purr10 @Christi65894804 @SierraClub @IndivisibleTeam work on storing a scaling solar and wind generation, then you might have something. water generated hydrogen is the future to get us off oil
@purr10 @SierraClub @IndivisibleTeam no, Trump is making sure we have enough energy to bridge the gap to a cleaner energy source, solar and wind isn't developed enough yet
@equalandallied @Christi65894804 @350 @IndivisibleTeam there needs to be a separation between science and governmnet
@equalandallied @Christi65894804 @350 @IndivisibleTeam and it's OK with you that politics and tax dollars are driving the science behind human caused climate change investigation?
@equalandallied @Christi65894804 @350 @IndivisibleTeam 3rd every time politically supported scientist go and check on sea ice at the poles, they need to be rescued because there is more ice
@equalandallied @Christi65894804 @350 @IndivisibleTeam 2nd the false studies from Penn State U and East Anglian U in the UK have never been retracted
@equalandallied @Christi65894804 @350 @IndivisibleTeam 1st, you mean to say human caused climate change, your afraid to call what you support by it's truename
your marching will accomplish what?  supporting real science that will have real results will make more of a difference than any march can https://t.co/Tl5oQj2NHJ

@Christi65894804 @350 @IndivisibleTeam I'm supporting scientific research into the use of hydrogen from water for a viable replacement for fossil fuels, better than bogus march
@350 @IndivisibleTeam again fighting against something that is based on fake science, what a waste of energy
@SierraClub @IndivisibleTeam call it what you really think it is human caused climate change.  you know it would get you less sympathy
@SierraClub @IndivisibleTeam instead of fighting, why don't you come up with solutions to truly replace fossil fuels
@ASlavitt @IndivisibleTeam go and read state health care laws about pre existing conditions, you're all a bunch of scare mongers!!!
