This week we saw a major steel lift occur in the bldg of the International Arrivals Facility aerial walkway.

@ServantWarrior Hi there Joshua!	We have 3 pet relief areas on the secure side of the airport in the Central Terminal, the North and South Satellites! We also have 2 outdoor pet relief areas pre-security on the ends of the terminal! More info here: https://t.co/jOZRco2NJ3	Hope this helps! - RJ
@hammilljoe Hi Joe, so sorry to hear about this. We may be able to cheer you up with a surprise though. Would you be willing to DM us your location in the terminal? Thanks, Abbey
Sorry for the tough experience today travelers. The TSA has been dealing with some technical difficulties this morning. Wait times are shorter now. As always, we encourage travelers to get here early just in case lines could be long for some reason. https://t.co/qOW6dIHer9 https://t.co/KZWzDp73PC
Remember checkpoint wait times are unpredictable &amp; can change quickly. We're working w/ TSA to get you on your way quickly &amp; safely. 🙂Please plan ahead &amp; get here early: 2⃣ hours for domestic flight, 3⃣ for international. See wait times on Sea-Tac app📱: https://t.co/cbNy2qWDoP https://t.co/HO87mt6NVq

Last November, while runway 16L/34R was closed for construction, the @PortofSeattle Fire Department 👨🏾‍🚒👩🏻‍🚒 took advantage of the closure and used part of the runway to practice Aircraft Rescue Fire Fighting on its aircraft mockup. 🚒 #ThrowbackThursday https://t.co/TAYWHQvDRW

@MarnalovesAK 😊 Glad you liked them! Dining and retail coming soon! -Abbey
This is meant to get you on your way more quickly rather than wait on an aircraft on the airfield for an open gate. Thanks, Abbey (2/2)
@gavriella_cg Hi Gavi, I'm sorry it's a little chilly outside, but we're using  ‘hardstand operations,’ where passengers are shuttled to and from an aircraft parked away from the terminal building, to help relieve current  congestion for travelers during peak periods. (1/2)
@Craft3Carl You can also get this information on the Sea-Tac app, available for download for iOS and Android devices! https://t.co/Pae3vdB3K5 -Abbey
@GrantGurewitz Glad you liked it! More coming soon! 😁 -Abbey
Restrooms will be coming to the new facility soon. To accommodate passengers and airlines during peak periods, we’re opening up the North Satellite Modernization Project in phases so we can use the new gates immediately for operations. Thanks, Abbey (2/2)
@ZannLittleAK There are restrooms located in the original North Satellite facility, about 500 feet away. You can locate it easily on the Sea-Tac app, which will even give you step-by-step directions! (1/2)

@JonFreier Jon, happy to discuss in more detail if you DM us. -Perry
@JonFreier In addition, they park those aircraft overnight for use in the morning. They do not have enough leased gates to park all of their aircraft at gate locations. 		We could potentially add: If you have concerns about AA operations, you might reach out to them directly.  --Perry
@JonFreier Hi, Jon, 	Thanks for your note. You are correct. AA has more arrivals during the evening and averages 3-4 shuttle operations. They do this to avoid leaving aircraft/travelers waiting on the ramp. (1 of 2)
@epc303 We appreciate being in the good company of @DENAirport. #AirportTwitter 👊🏽
@madeintw Hi Jerome, very sorry to hear this. We will look into this further and see how we can improve the wayfinding and passenger experience. Thanks, Abbey
We are also investing in our facilities and passenger experience which includes critical projects such as the Central Terminal Renovation, North Satellite Modernization, and International Arrivals Facility. Thanks, Abbey
These operations and our new Concourse D Annex are designed to relieve current congestion for travelers waiting at crowded gates and aircraft waiting on the airfield for an open gate to deplane passengers during peak periods.  (2/3)
@JonFreier Jon, in 2018, Sea-Tac became the 8th busiest U.S. airport for passenger volume. Because of increased traffic, we have implemented ‘hardstand operations' where passengers are shuttled to and from an aircraft parked away from the terminal building.  (1/3)
@wahistorian Hi Elizabeth, I am sorry to hear this. Did you not find anything open? There are several dining options open for breakfast, sit down and grab and go options. Please let us know how we can help. Thanks, Abbey

@JonahBond The K9s allow enhanced screening similar to PreCheck for general screening passengers at a faster pace. We appreciate your patience, Abbey (3/3)
@JonahBond The TSA has determined the best use for checkpoints 4 and 5 is to allow PreCheck through those checkpoints and direct general screening through checkpoints 2 and 3, which will both use K9s during peak periods. (2/3)
@JonahBond Hey there, I understand your frustration. TSA is responsible for the security process and the checkpoints, while the Port helps to manage the queues outside the checkpoints. (1/3)
@catlikesbridges @SoundTransit 🙌🏽
@SEO_rtiz @dr_pete Yes, the lines can look terrible at times, but the TSA K9s keep it moving quickly. That's usually why our Pathfinders will tell you to move to the longer line, they know the K9 is working and it'll move more quickly. Thx, Abbey
@MikeWitting12 Sorry your experience wasn’t a good one today, but I hope your visits in the future will be better. Thanks, Abbey (3/3)
@MikeWitting12 However, if you take that same number of staff to another checkpoint, you can open more lanes and increase throughput  — getting travelers through the scanners. So, it makes more sense to open more lanes at one checkpoint than use more staff to open fewer lanes at another. (2/3)
@MikeWitting12 Hi Michael, we truly appreciate you getting here two hours early. Staffing and K9 availability are two reasons why you may see certain checkpoints that are not open to general screening. It takes more staff just to open a checkpoint. (1/3)
@dr_pete Hi Dr. Pete – welcome to summers at Sea-Tac! This is our busiest time of year, so the lines can get pretty long. Mornings are also a peak time of day. Hopefully the TSA K9s were helping move things along quickly. -Abbey

@meechaleech711 @Clear @TSA For line queuing, this is due to space constraints in our current terminal. Unlike other airports, we don’t have large open spaces in front of chkpnts. We’re handling similar sized crowds but looks worse as we have to meander lines through breezeways &amp; around escalators. -Abbey
@meechaleech711 @Clear @TSA Takes certain # of staff to open an entire chkpnt. They can get more lanes open (increases throughput- getting thru scanners) if they put staff at an already open chkpnt rather than open another entire chkpnt. Once they get more staff, they can open addtl lanes in other chkpnts.
@meechaleech711 @Clear @TSA I understand. It’s counter intuitive at 1st glance. Part of it, isTSA is facing staffing challenges at Sea-Tac &amp; that creates the bottle neck for the checkpoints. They’re working hard to hire more staff, &amp; we expect additional staffing actions by the TSA to help the situation.
@Brad4Progress @TSA Also, TSA determined best use for chkpnts 4 &amp; 5 is to allow PreCheck &amp; direct general screening through chkpnts 2 &amp; 3, which both use K9s during peak periods. K9s allow enhanced screening similar to PreCheck for general screening pax at a faster pace. - Abbey (2/2)

@leemoua27 We'll continue to meet with them &amp; encourage solutions that will meet the expectations of our travelers in what will be our busiest summer travel period ever. Thanks for your understanding, &amp; we're working hard to ensure your next Sea-Tac experience is a better one. –Abbey (3/3)
@leemoua27 We are working hard with our partners at the TSA to address these staffing issues. They are working hard to hire more staff, and we expect additional staffing actions by the TSA to help the situation. (2/3)
@leemoua27 Hi Lance, sorry to hear you’ve had a few poor experiences at Sea-Tac. This is not the type of customer service we want to provide here at Sea-Tac. The TSA has faced staffing challenges here at Sea-Tac and that creates the bottle neck for the checkpoints. (1/3)
@CherylFelice1 Cheryl, TSA determined best use for chkpnts 4 &amp; 5 is to allow PreCheck  &amp; direct general screening through chkpnts 2 and 3, which will both use K9s during peak periods. The K9s allow enhanced screening similar to PreCheck for general screening passengers at a faster pace. -Abbey
@yogitacoasaurus The K9s allow enhanced screening similar to PreCheck for general screening passengers at a faster pace. This is why you don’t have to take off your shoes and why it moves more quickly when the K9s are being used. We appreciate your patience. -Abbey (2/2)

@Gnobrin Hi Aaron, yes we know they look bad. Unlike a lot of other airports that have large open areas for queuing security checkpoint lines, Sea-Tac does not. (1/4)

All power restored. Minor delays are expected as aircraft arrive and depart as we catch up on the backlog. We are expected to catch up soon. Thanks for your patience.
As some of you saw we experienced power issues at Sea-Tac today. Power is slowly coming back on. Flights are taking off and landing.
It’s not a secret. Think opposite! Skip that traffic on the departures drive in the morning by dropping off your passenger on the arrivals level. Do the opposite in the evenings by picking them up on the departures drive. #SeaTacHacks https://t.co/BcqCmPEKK4

Congrats @BeechersSeattle @Delta @hungerfighters @HMSHost @IvarsClam, Green Gateway Environmental Excellence Award winners.
Our staff monitor flight paths for compliance w/ established noise abatement flight procedures &amp; meet regularly w/ FAA to discuss results.
We’ve spent $400M to insulate 9400 single-family homes, 8 Highline School District schools, 14 Highline College buildings, 246 condo units.
Addressing impact of aircraft operations? Sea-Tac has one of the most comprehensive noise programs in the country.
Growing airport means increased economic impact &amp; increased connections to rest of the world for business, tourism &amp; local travelers.
Why more flights? Region’s economic growth + Delta’s use of SEA as W Coast hub to Asia. SEA grows in response to customer &amp; airline demand.
Who sets flight paths in &amp; out of SEA? Once planes push back from gates &amp; cross yellow line, it’s controlled by the FAA.

View from ticketing level around 11 a.m. Business as usual: customer service and safety are Sea-Tac's top priorities. https://t.co/hkFYwYSIC0
Travelers: ticketing running smoothly.  At this time you should expect crowds &amp; groups of protestors at baggage pick up &amp; checkpoints.
We’ve designated the Gina Marie Lindsey Arrivals Hall at south end of terminal as a free speech zone.
To keep travelers safe &amp; airport operating safely, we need to keep security checkpoints clear.
We believe the light rail delay lasted around 10 minutes.  It is now dropping off and picking up people at the Sea-Tac Airport stop.
For safety and operational reasons, we asked Sound Transit link light rail to briefly slow their schedule earlier.
