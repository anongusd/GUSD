@SenatorShaheen its funny that your state would benefit from the extra funding that would come with any climate change bill.. But that fact is that our Planet Earth goes through climate change...  Ice Ages, Thaws etc..  This is not anything that we can control.. This is a complete waste of $$$$

@Alex32528674 @CoffeeRaider @KamalaHarris Did you know that your state alone spends $957 million per year to subsidize illegal immigrants ? Our country as a whole spends over 84 Billion per year..
@Alex32528674 @CoffeeRaider @KamalaHarris Yes they put 1 billion on one of the bills that they proposed.  the 5.7 B would be for wall.fence, facilities for holding and processing legal immigrants, hundreds more border patrol agents and more judges to speed up the whole process
@Alex32528674 @CoffeeRaider @KamalaHarris as it is now the only places where it has stopped illegals is where there are walls.. some of the large population cities have installed walls and there has been a huge reduction of illegals in there towns..
@Alex32528674 @CoffeeRaider @KamalaHarris What it will do is deter many from even coming.. I personally am in favor of high fences with surveillance cameras.
