@BeerScribe This is a good argument for buying vintage beer from breweries rather than aging it yourself‚Äîlet us take the risk! Likewise, breweries appreciate the ability to control how the beer is stored while aging and QC it after.
3 vintages of barley wine now pouring at JaK's Alehouse:	-2014 featuring notes of apricot seed, toffee, pine.	-2015 featuring notes of brown sugar, peaches, and candied citrus.	-2016 featuring notes of floral hop, treacle, and stone fruit.
