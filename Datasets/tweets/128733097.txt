There’s been talk that a deal with the problem solvers caucus is imminent. McGovern, incoming rules chair, said he’s hopeful but “we’re not there yet”
Barbara Lee was gracious in defeat, but did talk about the “institutional barriers” black women in the caucus face. Second close leadership race she’s lost in two cycles.
Jeffries wins
Jeffries says counting should be done in 30-45 minutes. It’s going to be a long day.
Voting is closed in caucus chair race between Jeffries and Lee. Counting now.

And if McAdams wins, It would be 16 with a 16 seat margin. So.
Point is: keeping a letter like this to 15 likely floor-voting members, when the margin is looking like 15, shows some real work from Pelosi. There are others who've committed to voting against her still, but keeping them off the written pledge was the first step.
The anti-Pelosi letter is out. 16 signatures, one of whom (McAdams) is losing now. If it’s D+38, Pelosi can lose 15 votes on the floor.

@KristerJohnson it seems like the only option is to get a decent bipartisan bill out of the Senate and then put pressure on House Rs as the deadline approaches. Vulnerable House Rs might start feeling squeezed.
also, people don't understand the deal and think that Senate Democrats will filibuster on Feb. 8 if they don't have a DACA fix by then.
it has been fascinating reading responses to this from people who genuinely seem to think Schumer got a 6-year CHIP extension added into it the last three days.		Also, i'm not faulting them for caving. They were losing. Get it over with. https://t.co/Jn9h8qRhcB
