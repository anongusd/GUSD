Happy 182nd birthday to my hometown, Chicago! ¡Feliz cumpleaños a mi querido Chicago! https://t.co/mrda07CzGq
Trump’s zero tolerance policy does not make our country safer. It inflicts pain on families fleeing poverty and violence. We must end this inhumane policy and hold USCIS accountable for the delays in processing immigration cases and asylum applications. https://t.co/UwRDilAFtn
It took a lawsuit for DHS to extend #TPS till 2020 for El Salvador, Nicaragua, Haiti and Sudan. It brings some relief, but we need permanent protections and a path to citizenship. I look forward to working with my colleagues on #HR6 the Dream and Promise Act. https://t.co/upbI092TFj
Excited to have a date for the introduction of #HR6, the Dream and Promise Act.  #Dreamers and #TPS holders deserve a path to citizenship. Thanks to @RepRoybalAllard, @NydiaVelazquez &amp; @RepYvetteClarke for their work on this bill. https://t.co/Ki4GtV8eCt
There have already been 241 shootings in Chicago this year, even with the strict gun laws we have. To protect our communities we need universal background checks. I support #HR8 and H.R. 1112. https://t.co/c3WqCegGmX
Our health care system must do more to provide quality, affordable health care for people in my district like Victor, which is why I joined my colleagues today to introduce the #MedicareForAll Act. https://t.co/ROIyjVs7zk
LIVE AT THE CAPITOL with @RepJayapal and @RepDebDingell Dingell introducing #MedicareforAll. Far too many people remain uninsured in this country, including many in my district. Health care is a basic, human right. We need #MedicareForAll. https://t.co/szfivgugLl
Tune in to watch the #MedicareForAll press conference on my Facebook page at 11:15 ET with @RepJayapal and @RepDebDingell. Everyone deserves quality health care. There are people in my district who have to choose between their doctor’s appointment and paying their electric bill. https://t.co/Hf7cwRVf5s
Congratulations to Carmen Ayala on her appointment as the first woman and Latinx Illinois State Superintendent of Education! I know she will help create more educational opportunities for students. Great choice by Governor Pritzker. https://t.co/h9C82KRDo1
Since when do we call human beings in need national emergencies? We must reject the President’s premise that the presence of people like me in the country, of people like the constituents in my district, constitutes a national emergency. https://t.co/UjYQ2eCbla
I remain deeply concerned and disturbed to learn that the inhumane practice of separating children from their parents is still happening. No family should be torn apart by border patrol agents or by a broken immigration system. Stop Trump’s #FakeNationalEmergency
Border crossings are down to one-fifth of what they were in 2000. This emergency declaration is just one more step in the President’s anti-immigrant agenda and a violation of our democracy. Proud to stand with my colleagues to terminate Trump’s #FakeEmergency https://t.co/dEvEYKbFxu
Look at the creative thank you letter I got from the @HANACenter team! The work they do on immigration and Korean-American civic engagement in Illinois is so important. https://t.co/xqbvlpztZU
Humbled for the recognition I received last night from the Chicago Area Project, an organization I was privileged enough to work with when I headed Enlace Chicago. What they have done over 85 years of existence for the Chicago youth is to be celebrated and applauded. https://t.co/0UQkiGquMq
Community engagement and youth development have always been priorities to me in every job I’ve done. Now as a congressman, my commitment is still the same and I’ll continue working towards violence prevention in all of its forms. https://t.co/Fb6AMd8UjP
These students had brilliant policy questions for me today. Topics ranged from financial services, to transportation and infrastructure to Puerto Rico. They make me hopeful about the future of our community. https://t.co/IrulTnDV2Q
Had a stimulating conversation with talented young Latinx students at @UICLares, the Latin American Recruitment and Educational Services Program, at my alma mater @thisisUIC. LARES helps students achieve their educational goals. https://t.co/T7jTBg4S9T
Thank you to @HACIAworks for having me at their 40th annual banquet. As a member of the Transportation &amp; Infrastructure Commitee, I felt privileged to speak on the importance of infrastructure solutions that have Hispanics at the forefront. https://t.co/hPsTw5dm3P
Niños y familias vulnerables buscando refugio en la frontera no es una emergencia nacional. Este abuso de poder por parte del Presidente Trump no se puede permitir en un país donde existe balance de poderes. https://t.co/MwBDBBk1gl
Vulnerable children and families seeking safety at the border is not a national emergency. This power grab by the president cannot stand in a country of checks and balances, and we’ll make sure it doesn’t. https://t.co/dwOgXAmErd
Today in my home state, I joined civil rights leaders and groups to tell President Trump we will uphold the Constitution against his lawless emergency declaration. https://t.co/XGnTE4O27M
I will be joining IL AG Kwame Raoul, immigration and civil rights groups today at noon at Chicago’s Federal Plaza to protest Trump’s unlawful emergency declaration. See you there! https://t.co/6ANL4utkw8
Inspired, along with San Juan, PR Mayor @CarmenYulinCruz, to see the current generation of young Latinx leaders shaping our American democracy. They are not only the future but are the present, reclaiming the country we so dearly love. https://t.co/rbz4AQbZSe
Thank you to @TheUSHLI for the invite to discuss our broken  immigration system. Honored to share the stage with @RepDebHaaland, @RepRaulGrijalva, @CongressmanRaja, and Esther Lopez from The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW). https://t.co/FKWhBOUAYH
Another shooting has taken the lives of innocent people, now in Aurora, IL, just outside my district. My thoughts are with the families of the victims, and the families of the police officers injured in the line of duty.
The emergency declaration Trump announced today is an abuse of power. He wants to build an ineffective and wasteful wall to appeal to his political base. Congress must protect the integrity of our democracy and take action against the President's violation of the Constitution.
My parents, Miguel and Celia, came to the US to build a better future for me &amp; my family. It is the honor of my life to serve my community here in Congress. And I want to tell every immigrant in this country today: you are welcome here &amp; you are valued. #ToImmigrantsWithLove https://t.co/zFnaIlmer9
Today marks one year since the tragedy at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Let’s pause to remember the 17 lives lost that day. #NeverForget https://t.co/Jrg6CTmfye

Me enteré con gran tristeza sobre la trágica noticia de la muerte del pastor Vic de @LaVillitaChi, como todos lo llamábamos. Estoy agradecido de haberlo conocido y de llamarlo amigo. https://t.co/qW6IcxBsqg
I was saddened to learn the tragic news of the passing of Pastor Vic of @LaVillitaChi, as we all called him. He dedicated his life to improving our community, working particularly with at-risk youth. This is a huge loss for my district and for Chicago. https://t.co/OCWzCSAXay
Jazz trumpeter @johndaversa and his band of 53 DREAMers won 3 Grammy awards last night. Congratulations and thank you for giving a voice to these talented and courageous musicians. https://t.co/W5I0zmArxI
The passing of @RepWalterJones (NC-03) is a loss for all of us in the US Congress. He was one of the most moderate voices in the GOP, who constantly crossed the aisle to work in a bipartisan manner. My condolences to his family.
Gracias al Community Navigator Program por invitarme a la Reunión del Fondo de Protección Legal 2019. Estoy feliz de trabajar junto a organizaciones que ofrecen invaluables recursos a nuestra comunidad migrante para su bienestar legal.
Today I joined the Community Navigator Program at the 2019 Legal Protection Fund Convening. This is an essential program to help people in our community understand their legal rights. https://t.co/me2Rk9Wtdc
Venezuela is living a political, economic and humanitarian crisis. But Trump does not have authorization to use military force. I am cosponsoring a bill prohibiting US military action in Venezuela. We need to work with allies and pursue diplomatic avenues. https://t.co/O7WPVsmHsZ
He pensado mucho en Raquel Guerrero esta semana. Ella estuvo involucrada en todos los esfuerzos por hacer que Pilsen fuera una comunidad mejor. Ella alzó su voz por los inmigrantes y las familias trabajadoras. Agradezco haberla tenido como ejemplo. https://t.co/56Im4oDk5P
I’ve been thinking a lot about Raquel Guerrero. She was involved in every effort to make Pilsen a better community. She was a fierce voice for immigrants and for working families. She was a strong woman and I am grateful to have had her as a role model. https://t.co/AUVOd8T5qo
Noah was proud to show his art book, which featured a Catrina face on the cover. His after-school program at Telpochcalli Elementary also includes running, and his mom tags along sometimes! https://t.co/j7V32lqvEF

Hundreds of thousands of young, talented DREAMers have benefited from the implementation of DACA. DACA recipients are the lawyers, business owners, and teachers who serve as the backbone of my home in the fourth district. They deserve to live without fear. #ProtectDACA
Wishing my friend and tireless predecessor Luis Gutierrez a fast recovery. Follow the doctor’s orders and don’t give your wife a hard time. https://t.co/TCbmB4ibLu
My deepest condolences @RepDebDingell. John Dingell helped shape crucial legislation in the US Congress, including civil rights and health care. His legacy of bipartisanship is something we should aspire to.
I joined @TransportDems to be a voice for my constituents and to help build a transportation system that works for everyone. Watch my first Committee hearing remarks here:  https://t.co/wGQ0bYvhdA

Today, @TransportDems will address our country's critical need for infrastructure investment. Because Chicago is one of the largest transportation hubs in the nation, fixing America's bridges and transit systems must be a priority. https://t.co/rwll2rGQV1
I am an immigrant. I take this issue personally. The way the President has characterized immigrants denigrates the dignity and the humanity of millions around the world, including myself. Watch my speech on the floor of the House of Representatives here: https://t.co/qAKnrhxrxB

We need to hold the Trump administration accountable for the damage it has caused to migrant children by separating them from their families. We must continue to work to ensure all children are accounted for and reunited with their families. https://t.co/TqT4JBYRNV

Federal workers are heading back to work, but their paychecks have yet to arrive. What’s worse, employees of contractors will not get paid. Congress needs to address the aftermath of the #TrumpShutdown and pass a bill that pays all workers.
Holocaust Remembrance Day is a reminder of our failure to address racism and discrimination that still lives on today. The 6 million victims of the Holocaust and the lessons from their fate should never be forgotten. #WeRemember https://t.co/pe5KDjeAGN
Today's news of mandatory ground stops of flights is deeply concerning. This #TrumpShutdown is threatening the livelihoods of airport workers desperate for a paycheck and is impeding the flow of air traffic. Senator McConnell and President Trump must reopen the government now!

@FTA_DOT safety inspectors who keep our commuters safe aren’t getting paid. Air traffic controllers who keep our airways safe won't be able to provide for themselves and their families. That’s why I voted for the 10th time today to reopen the government. https://t.co/DQmZgMd58g

DACA must be protected. We will not allow these young people to be used as a bargaining chip for @realDonaldTrump’s border wall. I and other House Democrats will not stop fighting for a proper pathway to citizenship.
