@yashalevine @retheauditors @CraigSilverman I think most reporters treat an oral off-the-record agreement as seriously as a written NDA. I certainly do.
@perdrix @realDonaldTrump Yes. Totally routine in journalism. We call or email the White House press staff to seek comment on every story. Sometimes they choose not to respond, which is their right.
@perdrix Doubt that "many" are following this discussion. But trust me, this had nothing to do with "tipping off HRC." For you sins, you are sentenced to read our two-part series on HRC and Libya and then get back to me on whether we were somehow defending her. https://t.co/lVUOAXjP6u
@yashalevine @CraigSilverman As for disclosure: NDA is essentially a written version of off-the-record. @CraigSilverman quite properly did not give us the details on who gave him the agenda from the meeting where I spoke. I have no special relationship with folks at the meeting. Nothing to disclose.
@yashalevine @CraigSilverman You're entitled to your opinion. Before signing the NDA I clarified that I was allowed to follow up outside the meeting on anything I learned there -- totally routine in journalism. So I followed up and got the Alabama story outside the NDA.
@yashalevine I think you, @CraigSilverman and everybody else who's weighed in on this should read it: https://t.co/cgIlrRh4nD
@yashalevine Yasha: Not a penny! The organizer had read a book I wrote long ago called DIsmantling Utopia: How Information Ended the Soviet Union. He asked if I'd speak to his gathering on Soviet and Russian disinformation. I did, and picked up the seed of this Alabama story.
@perdrix Completely normal journalistic practice to seek comment from the subject of a story, of course. But especially important when you might unwittingly get someone mentioned in a cable locked up or worse.
@perdrix Sure. I've explained this before. WikiLeaks and our other partners in publishing the cables cooperated in redacting them to prevent harm to many people named in the cables. As part of that process, all agreed the NYT would approach the State Dept for any feedback or comment.
@R_H_Ebright Hi Richard! As we've written many times, Facebook ad spending was not a big factor in the Russian 2016 social media op, which relied on viral sharing of inflammatory memes. You're comparing salaries of Americans in the Ala op to ad purchases by the IRA. Not meaningful.

@eisingerj I'll look forward to reading it all at ProPublica! But I'm surprised you see no issue here.
@pnrodenbush Certainly at my shop we don't run stories on leaked material without verifying that the material is real. But that's going to get a lot harder. And I agree that we were manipulated in 2016, as I write. But question back at you: What should we have done differently?
@BenBrodyDC Appreciate that. There are no obvious answers that I can find, but the dilemma seemed worth airing.
@RonDeibert Thanks, will do
@jacksonhole59 Not sure of your point. But most Americans don't have time to read through thousands of leaked emails, interview govt officials, dig up court documents. That's why they rely on journalists.
@marty_lederman @JameelJaffer Totally agree, and I could have made that clearer
@Johnsmith_sr @runasand Actually, I think you need to reread the piece. Generally leaks are about powerful people, and we write about them all the time.
@JameelJaffer @marty_lederman But does it disturb you at all that in the 2016 case, Russian intelligence bosses (presumably) delivered to us American journalists one side's emails and not the others? I find it hard to be comfortable with that.
@Neil_C_Williams Wow. Thank you, Google.
@marty_lederman As you know, Marty, editors have pushed us for years to say what we can about sources. Sometimes we do a poor job of that.
@JameelJaffer @marty_lederman Yes. But i know of no case so far where CIA or FBI dumped a huge archive of confidential emails, for instance.
@marty_lederman All good pts. I think the difference is probably one of kind, not degree. Hacking is what makes this different. If CIA, or a dismayed CIA officer, is leaking, that's a familiar situation. If Russian intel is leaking CIA documents, it's potentially far more disorienting, I think.

@R_H_Ebright @M_Stone969 @jbarro Isn't it a bit like a TV ad served to 126 million people? Many passively see it pass by, some look elsewhere, some take notice and a few pay attention and buy the product. If it had "close to zero" effect, billions would not be spent on ads.
@intheglare Yes, that's a better way of putting it. It showed up in their feed.

@msuiche @Bing_Chris Not really. Does not look like prosecutors believe Martin was a witting source for TSB. But appears Martin was not super-careful with the stuff in his shed or on his home computers. If he drew attention at conferences, someone may have targeted him. But that's pure speculation.
Will be interesting to see how this gambit by an ex-NSA guy who stuffed his shed and car with classified documents comes out. If prosecutors give him a break, Trump may tweet at them,,,,  https://t.co/as4EZeaJuM
@wikileaks .Wrong. By agreement of all media partners, we talked at length to State Dept each day about cables involving a particular country. They lined up country specialists. It worked well. WikiLeaks helped organize the redactions to protect people who might be harmed if named.
@DogplaysGod @wikileaks Publication dates were decided by WikiLeaks in consultation with media partners. We didn't want to scoop one another.
And a good book it is for those interested in the complexities of actual journalism: https://t.co/sgyXehcnjB https://t.co/2LQEL7tLWq
@wikileaks .This is nonsense. Check with the WikiLeaks volunteers who worked on this project. You'll learn WL created an online redaction engine so we could take out names of those who might be imprisoned or worse from cables we published. WL agreed on the consultation with State Dept.
@wikileaks .5) For that collaborative project, WikiLeaks' helpers created a very cool redaction template so that the different media outlets could see what they had redacted and what others had redacted to avoid mistakes. So @WikiLeaksin that instance followed legit journalistic principles.
@wikileaks .4) I told the State Dept we planned to use that cable. Their Libya specialists got on the phone with me and told me they feared that if we published the protocol chief's name, the great leader might take it as an insult and order his execution. We took the name out.
@wikileaks .3) Totally standard journalistic practice. In one memorable instance, I had not taken out the name of Qaddafi's protocol chief, who in a cable preceding a visit to NYC had explained that the aging Qaddafi should not be asked to climb too many stairs, etc.
@wikileaks .2) We had all agreed to redact the names of, say, Chinese professors and Russian dissidents who had spoken confidentially with US diplomats to prevent their being imprisoned or worse. But we wanted to make sure we understood all the potential dangers.
@wikileaks .1) Not sure who's writing this stuff for @WikiLeaks, but they need to talk to those who actually worked on the diplomatic cables. WikiLeaks, NYT and the other media partners (Guardian, Le Monde et al) all agreed on a plan to inform State Dept which cables were being published.
As a loyal reader, I say that's an outrage https://t.co/2OpvcFDLTt

12 – Paperback of #ObjectiveTroy looks less daunting! Hope will lure some more readers to this tale. Lots more at https://t.co/R1jX3dJGDH.
11 – In the Afterword I introduce a fascinating guy, @ShaterWalied, career Secret Service, who helped FBI with Awlaki after 9/11.
10 – Awlaki’s influence has turned up in dozens of cases in the West: Boston Marathon to Charlie Hebdo to San Bernardino and more.
9 – The past few years it has become steadily more clear that killing Awlaki (5 years ago 9/30) did not curtail his huge Internet following.
8 – The book also looks at Barack Obama and the roots of his decision to order the first drone killing of a US citizen.
7 -- #ObjectiveTroy follows Awlaki as he redirects his burning ambition and talent in a steadily more sinister direction.
6 – But then he found out that the FBI had followed this married father of 3 on visits to prostitutes in DC hotels. He panicked and fled US
5 – He was on the way to becoming a national voice for Muslims, calmly charismatic and with a gift for explaining Islam.
4 – In 2001, Awlaki denounced 9/11, spoke at the Pentagon and called for bridge-building, becoming something of a media star.
3 – I try to tell a human story of the secular son of a US-loving Yemeni family who found religion (in the US) and became a mainstream imam
2 -- So I’ll mark the occasion with a few comments and updates for those interested. Some of this I write about in a new Afterword.

@jeff_kaye thanks, interesting. Would be great to get the still secret documents.

@yazankhm @ScottShaneNYT Too long for Twitter! Read Objective Troy
@JameelJaffer ditto. Always good to be skeptical, toward all parties
@yazankhm Sure. But since millions were angry about Iraq, and a tiny number responded with terrorism, other factors are probably decisive.
@JameelJaffer Readers can decide if Pham made this up; to me the details make his account credible. That Awlaki plotted violence is clear.

@yazankhm You raise great questions. No question the US wars, esp Iraq, had a big impact on Awlaki. It's personality, ideology, geopolitics.
@JameelJaffer True. Possible that he made it up, of course. But to me it seemed quite plausible that Awlaki did what he told others to do.

@teaksoldier @mucha_carlos Actually, Obama said he believed Awlaki was entitled to due process and got it, via secret exec branch review
@KarenGreenberg3 @BenWeiserNYT Yes. In #ObjectiveTroy I concluded that drones' existence made capture an extreme political risk for Obama.
@JameelJaffer Yes, surely he wants a lighter sentence. But like Abdulmutallab, Pham tells a detailed and credible story about Awlaki.

@Alex__Katz Not sure it's obvious when it's unprecedented. Obama administration spent a lot of time studying whether this was legal.
@Alex__Katz So, do I think it was legally and policy-wise smart to kill Awlaki, or not? No right answer. I'm curious about your impression.
@Alex__Katz Thanks, Alex! How would you describe the policy and legal arguments? I hoped to complicate the beliefs of all ideologues.

@lowki You read it? We got the OLC opinions by fighting in court four years, and I explained it at length. Wonder what you think is missing.
Thanks, @BrianFishman for calling #ObjectiveTroy "incredibly well-researched and written"! @WarOn TheRocks https://t.co/jCf1jvPVIf
@dametzger Of course, everything you listed took place after 9/11. So you'll want to reach back farther to find motivations for that.
@dametzger Hmm. Then one would have to explain why he took that path, and 99.9 percent of US Muslims did not.
@BobbyChesney Publisher's idea. We want to make it easy for you busy academics.
@dametzger Wrote a whole book on that. Combination of personal ambition, family tension, Iraq war, and taking Quranic prophecy seriously.
@BobbyChesney Don't know date but I need to give them a new afterword by Feb. 22. Will find out! Also drafting a professor's guide.
Awlaki established his authority with 53 CDs on Life of the Prophet. Then could lead the naive to violent jihad. https://t.co/5Kt6EcXd6c
Thinking about that now for afterword for #ObjectiveTroy paperback. Think it's his huge body of mainstream work. https://t.co/5Kt6EcXd6c
Awlaki surfaces in these cases every time, huh? He's the easiest path from mainstream to Al Qaeda. #ObjectiveTroy https://t.co/x2NhLnp118
@lisaletostak Part of the problem is that Awlaki openly called for violence only rarely. Most of his stuff does not violate YouTube rules.
@lisaletostak Thanks, Lisa. Very difficult question: whether it is wise or effective for companies like YouTube to take down Awlaki's stuff.
@msbellows @20committee But was capture and a trial "feasible"? Check out my book on all this. https://t.co/ra82HnN9CB
@20committee Whining?
If true, strongest example of his hands-on knowledge of explosives. Awlaki practiced what he preached. https://t.co/u6vSnzXRq7
@PatrickFo thanks, Patrick, glad you liked the book! And about the movie, we'll see.....

@lowki Govt can't coerce the companies either. Still would violate First Amendment, I believe
@carimachet Sure, consider it considered.
@_R_S_S_ A few surprises in it. And I tried to use his life and death to understand the big issues of the era.
@_R_S_S_ True! And book-writers are even worse. Nonetheless, if you're interested in Awlaki, read Objective Troy  https://t.co/iTUoC1cjYN
@carimachet Again, read Objective Troy https://t.co/iTUoC1cjYN Lots on assassination. Also, see this new piece https://t.co/P9sQcASAk7
@dametzger Quite true. But the war doesn't exist without 9/11. And 9/11 doesn't exist without the anti-Soviet jihad. World's a complex place
@_R_S_S_ He had a huge influence before he was killed. But he has more power because, in the view of his fans, he was martyred by the US

.@charlie_savage @gregorydjohnsen Good point from the author of a great new book on Obama and national security law, Power Wars

.@gregorydjohnsen Combination of the personal (eg fleeing possible exposure as a hypocrite in US) and US policy (Iraq war). #ObjectiveTroy

.@gregorydjohnsen We know of one in May 2011 that was a near miss. Awlaki later described it in Inspire magazine #ObjectiveTroy
.@joanneleon @dametzger @pblake142 @gregorydjohnsen I think there is some disillusionment on Obama's part. Strikes are down. #ObjectiveTroy
.@gregorydjohnsen I think so. Awlaki endorsed the Islamic State of Iraq in a 2008 talk, and ISIS used it in a 2013 video #ObjectiveTroy

.@gregorydjohnsen Some have called for a "drone court" -- secret, but a way to consider the evidence #ObjectiveTroy
.@gregorydjohnsen Not really. We know the lawyers at Dept of Justice who wrote the opinions authorizing the strike. #ObjectiveTroy
.@gregorydjohnsen And the question of the precedent set by US even worries many Obama admin officials #ObjectiveTroy
.@gregorydjohnsen This will be a big issue as soon as Russia or China uses a drone to kill an enemy outside their borders #ObjectiveTroy

.@gregorydjohnsen Yes, I think many Americans applauded the killing of Awlaki and may not have considered the legal issues #ObjectiveTroy
.@pblake142 @gregorydjohnsen I think the unintended death of a 16 year old had an impact inside govt. Drone strikes are down. #ObjectiveTroy
.@bensmp @gregorydjohnsen @lerodblog Excellent point. But there is little public accountability on drones.  #ObjectiveTroy
.@gregorydjohnsen Yes. Obama believed "due process does not mean judicial process." Could be just a secret review #ObjectiveTroy
.@lowki Odd as it may seem, he was casting himself in 2001 as a bridge builder. And might well have been one. #ObjectiveTroy
Don't know of any public govt investigation of drone strikes, esp of their efficacy: a problem. #Objective Troy https://t.co/RINPqOpGVU
.@gregorydjohnsen He learned that the FBI had a file on his regular visits to prostitutes. Feared exposure as a hyppocrite #ObjectiveTroy

Yet another case of Awlaki's posthumous influence, not ended by drone https://t.co/gspSfADKV1
@gwupoe Of course. My mind's in Yemen.
@gwupoe Awlaki's family lobbied Saleh to get him out of Yemeni prison in 2007. But A would never approve Saleh's coalition with the Houthis

RT @gregorydjohnsen: Judging from the comments on @ScottShaneNYT's Fresh Air appearance - people still debating Awlaki: http://t.co/XZAGe2G…
Awlaki’s story shows both the power of one voice in the YouTube era and how the terrorist threat has changed America. #ObjectiveTroy 3/3
How did Obama come to embrace the drone and order the killing of an American citizen without trial? #ObjectiveTroy 2/3
How does an intelligent and charismatic man like Anwar al-Awlaki decide to devote himself to the murder of strangers? #ObjectiveTroy 1/3

@joshgerstein actually wouldn't say that. But his discovery of FBI surveillance prompted him to flee US, and the rest is history.
@ShazadAkbar @ScottShaneNYT Not quite. Awlaki is a huge influence and an unusual case. Other AQ leaders killed don't have YouTube afterlife.
