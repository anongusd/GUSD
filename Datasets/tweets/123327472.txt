America has not had a presidential funeral since Gerald Ford died in December 2006. He passed away just after a midterm election in which Democrats won Congress. His departure occasioned a moment of bipartisan coming together — but just a moment.
But George H.W. Bush never liked it when Obama or others praised him as a way to jab at George W. Bush. “Has he said anything nice about my son’s foreign policy?” the elder Bush asked in 2008 when we told him that Obama had hailed his foreign policy. https://t.co/lXlnCCBdPE

Corker announces he will vote for Kavanaugh: "While both individuals provided compelling testimony, nothing that has been presented corroborates the allegation."
Trump unconvinced by Christine Blasey Ford: "The Senate must vote."
Kavanaugh says he did not watch Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony because he was busy preparing his own. “I planned to but I did not.” This also echoes Clarence Thomas, who did not watch Anita Hill, though he said he chose not to because they were lies.
With all eyes on him, Flake offers only cryptic comments: "There is doubt. We’ll never move beyond that. Just have a little humility on that."
At least some Republican senators have clearly had enough of deferring to their hired prosecutor and are now engaging themselves.

Trump confirms that he rejected a meeting with Canada’s Justin Trudeau because of trade dispute. “We don’t like their representative very much."
Kasich comes out against Kavanaugh confirmation without investigation: "Without an investigation, and with so many serious issues involved, I can’t support this nomination if they choose to move forward."
Trump says Obama was on the verge of war with North Korea that would have killed millions of people.
Trump says Pompeo reassured him that he was performing fine. “That’s not the 25th Amendment I’m looking at,” he quotes Pompeo telling him.
Trump says he may delay tomorrow’s meeting with Rosenstein to avoid conflicting with the Kavanaugh hearing. “My preference would be to keep him and let him finish up."
Trump says he sympathizes with Kavanaugh and others accused of sexual misconduct because he has been. “I’ve had many false charges.”
Trump: “I’ve been a famous person for a long time.”
Trump says women who have accused him of sexual misconduct were paid off. “They took money to say bad things about me.”
Trump says he has stood by so many accused men because “I’ve known them for a long time, a lot of these people” and “I never saw them do anything wrong."
Trump on George Washington: “Didn’t he have a few things in his past?”
Even as he calls the allegations against Kavanaugh part of a “con job,” Trump broaches the idea of a “replacement” and says that in watching the hearing, “I could be persuaded also."
Trump predicts that Kavanaugh will get three to five Democratic votes if he wins confirmation.

Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats all on Trump to withdraw Kavanaugh or open a full FBI investigation into sexual misconduct allegations: "The standard of character and fitness for a position on the nation’s highest court must be higher than this."
Lindsey Graham calls latest allegations against Kavanaugh a “smear campaign,” saying he had a "difficult time believing any person would continue to go to – according to the affidavit – ten parties over a two-year period where women were routinely gang raped and not report it."
Trump fires back on latest Kavanaugh accuser: "Avenatti is a third rate lawyer who is good at making false accusations, like he did on me and like he is now doing on Judge Brett Kavanaugh. He is just looking for attention ... a total low-life!"
Kavanaugh disputes latest allegation: "This is ridiculous and from the Twilight Zone. I don’t know who this is and this never happened."
Senate Judiciary Committee Republican majority says it has received the declaration provided by Avenatti and “committee lawyers are in the process of reviewing it now.”

Feinstein rejects Grassley proposal for staff interviews of Kavanaugh, Ford: "In view of the enormity and seriousness of these allegations a staff-only phone call behind closed doors is unacceptable and Democratic staff will not participate. This isn’t how things should be done."
Two women who dated Kavanaugh in high school and college say the allegations do not reflect the man they knew. "He was always a perfect gentleman, and I vouch for him completely,” one says. When "we were together he always respectful, kind and thoughtful,” says the other.
Trump stands by Kavanaugh in the face of allegations of sexual assault, calling him "one of the finest people I’ve ever known” and faulting Democrats for waiting to bring up the issue. But he says he wants the process to proceed and "hear everybody out."
Trump says there will be a trade announcement tonight after the markets close.
In first comments on accusation against Kavanaugh, Trump says he's okay with postponing the vote as long as it’s not too long. "If it takes a little delay it'll take a little delay,” he says. Asked if Kavanaugh had offered to withdraw, Trump says, “What a ridiculous question."
Grassley says Kavanaugh accuser "deserves to be heard so I will continue working on a way to hear her out in an appropriate, precedented and respectful manner.” He proposes phone calls with her and Kavanaugh but says Feinstein has refused to agree.

Lindsey Graham broaches the idea of hearing testimony on allegation against Kavanaugh: "If the committee is to hear from Ms. Ford it should be done immediately so the process can continue as scheduled.”
Grassley’s office says that if Feinstein took the allegations against Kavanaugh seriously, she should have brought them up much earlier: "It raises a lot of questions about Democrats’ tactics and motives to bring this to the rest of the committee’s attention only now."
Feinstein says allegations against Kavanaugh should be investigated by the FBI "before the Senate moves forward on this nominee."

Great job by @JonLemire, thanks for asking the tough questions.
Not a new thought but worth noting again that Trump was far harsher on American allies Germany and Britain than he just was on Russia.
Asked if Russia has compromising information on Trump, Putin does not answer, saying instead only that he did not personally know that Trump was in Moscow when he visited as a private businessman.
RT @RosieGray: .@jeffmason1 and @JonLemire both asked great questions at this press conference
Trump: “President Putin was extremely strong in his denial today.” And Putin offered to have his investigators work with US investigators. “I think that’s an incredible offer.”
Asked if he would condemn Russia for its intervention, Trump instead criticizes FBI and talks about the Democratic server and Hillary Clinton’s deleted emails.
Fabulous job by @jeffmason1 today.
Putin says he wanted Trump to win the election: "Yes I did. Yes I did. Because he talked about bringing the US-Russia relationship back to normal."
Putin just raised Bill Browder without being asked, attacking him and his associates for making money illegally and contributing it to Hillary Clinton.
Regarding the 12 Russian military intelligence officers identified and indicted by the United States, Putin says, “I will look into it."
The consensus conclusion by US intelligence agencies that Russia intervened in the US election? “This is utter nonsense,” Putin says. “… There’s no evidence when it comes to the actual facts."
Trump repeats his refrain that there was “no collusion.” Worth remembering that his son, son-in-law and campaign chairman accepted a meeting explicitly advertised as the Russian government offering incriminating information about Trump’s opponent to help him win the election.
Trump keeps casting Russia’s election intervention in terms of a Democratic excuse for its defeat, not in terms of a foreign power’s actions.
Trump repeats that the Mueller probe is responsible for trouble in the Russian-American relationship, not Russia’s intervention in the election: “The probe is a disaster for our country. It’s kept us separated."
Does Trump hold Russia responsible for anything? @jeffmason1 asks. “I hold both countries responsible."
Trump says that when he described Russia as a “competitor,” he meant it to be “a compliment."
Trump says he and Putin spent a lot of time talking about the Russian interference, expresses no criticism of Moscow’s actions.
With Trump at his side, Putin again denies US election intervention: “The Russian state has never interfered and is not going to interfere into internal American affairs including election process. Any specific material, if such things arise, we are willing to analyze together."

Blankenship, who called himself "Trumpier than Trump," loses West Virginia GOP primary a day after the real Trump came out against him. @tripgabriel  https://t.co/9kHxELwIZ7
Somehow it feels like this White House readout may have left something out: "President Donald J. Trump spoke today with President Emmanuel Macron of France. The two leaders reaffirmed their shared commitment to peace and stability in the Middle East."
Saudi Arabia expresses support for Trump move on Iran. While it previously supported the deal, it says Iran "took advantage of the economic benefits afforded by the lifting of sanctions and used them to continue its destabilizing activities in the region."
Obama calls Trump decision to pull out of Iran deal a “serious mistake” that will make the world a more dangerous place. The move "turns our back on America’s closest allies” and "risks eroding America’s credibility and puts us at odds with the world’s major powers."
So far, reaction to Trump’s decision to pull out of the Iran deal has fallen along predictable lines: Republicans and Israel for, Democrats and Europe against.
May, Macron &amp; Merkel reject Trump move: "Our governments remain committed to ensuring the agreement is upheld &amp; will work with all the remaining parties to the deal to ensure this remains the case including through ensuring the continuing economic benefits to the Iranian people."
Netanyahu hails Trump for his “historic move” and “courageous leadership” in ending Iran nuclear agreement: "The deal didn’t push war further away, it actually brought it closer. The deal didn’t reduce Iran’s aggression, it dramatically increased it."
Bolton disputes the conclusion that Iran has been in compliance with the nuclear agreement and says there was no way to say it is abiding by the deal “unless you are 100 percent certain that IAEA and our intelligence are infallible.”
As a result of Trump’s decision, U.S. sanctions on Iran are reimposed right away, blocking any new business contracts. For already-existing contracts, the administration says there will be a wind-down period of 90 days to 180 days.
As Trump scraps Iran nuclear deal, he says Pompeo is en route to Pyongyang as part of an effort to make a deal with North Korea.
Trump told Macron this morning that he will announce withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal. Trump is preparing to reinstate all sanctions waived as part of the nuclear accord — and impose additional economic penalties as well. @MarkLandler https://t.co/5H2pcB77Ih

Trump is conflating the cost of putting an “embassy” sign on an existing consular building in Jerusalem and constructing an entirely new embassy. Even while they’re doing the first, they’re still planning to do the second, which will cost hundreds of millions of dollars.
Trump suggests he might go for the embassy opening in Jerusalem next month. “I may go. Very proud of it."
Trump says he had his name “half signed” on an order to build a new embassy in Jerusalem but stopped when he saw it would cost $1 billion. Instead, he says he could do it for $150,000.
