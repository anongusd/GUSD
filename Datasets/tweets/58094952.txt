All renters must be presented a so-called “Good Neighbor Policy” informing them they must abide by law and be respectful. If law Enforcement is called, they may be responsible for paying fees incurred. #nbc7 (By the way, not even close to hearing public comment yet!)
Under Mayor Faulconer’s “compromise” plan (his word), those who don’t live in their homes they rent out, can only do so for 6 months a year. They’re allowed maximum of two licenses at $949 a year. Must have 3 night minimum stay in coastal areas and downtown. #nbc7
Right Now: Council getting some very interesting data on STVR’s: Between Oct ‘16 - Dec ‘17, market grew 82%. Most of them - 45% are in four areas: Mission Beach, Pacific Beach, La Jolla, and Downtown. In Mission Beach 44% of homes are STVR’s. #nbc7 https://t.co/ZSXK4KtMn8

@BenHigginsSD The ridiculous Tuesday 8:10 pm start doesn't help at all.
@DerekNBCSD @sdutCanepa @corybriggs @SDUTKrasovic I believe the NFL Greed Handbook explicitly states, change rules if it makes us richer
@sdutCanepa @DerekNBCSD @corybriggs @SDUTKrasovic Agreed. But let's watch the NFL walk away from Vegas' $750 million in public money .
@DerekNBCSD @corybriggs @sdutCanepa Then again we're talking about the NFL cartel. Take a look at @SDUTKrasovic article.

@sdutCanepa @DerekNBCSD @ynot377 @vosdscott Yes, but what about debt on old stadiums. Happening here now, right?
@sdutCanepa @DerekNBCSD @ynot377 @vosdscott I don't believe the teams pay for deferred maintenance.
@sdutCanepa @DerekNBCSD @ynot377 @vosdscott I believe Atlanta, Detroit, Minnesota, Indianapolis, St.Louis, San Diego, soon Oakland.
@sdutCanepa @DerekNBCSD @ynot377 @vosdscott Big time: Cities paying for stadiums that no longer have teams using them. This removes SD.
@leisurebolt @DerekNBCSD @vosdscott @sdutCanepa Why is that? Doesn't have to be built in MV. Need owner who actually wants to be here.
@sdutCanepa @DerekNBCSD @vosdscott Nick, I love you man. What is wrong with this plan? "Small Time" just doesn't seem like an argument.
@sdutCanepa @DerekNBCSD Did those owners decide to move their teams elsewhere? I hear ya, but I think it's something public should consider.
@sdutCanepa @DerekNBCSD There are MLS teams in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas (not exactly small markets). Support it Nick!
@sdutCanepa @DerekNBCSD If I may, this is not thinking small. There's room for NFL stadium (for owner who actually wants to be in San Diego)

@PeegeRiley @ivanrg77 @cesarhfutbol Excellent analogy. You're right.
@AndyCohenSD @DerekNBCSD Stadium would be 30,000 seat with SDSU option to eventually expand. Bigger issue involves bowl games status.
@BryanWeigel No. but they say more info coming soon. Web site is a great idea to inform public.
@TonyCapobianco In this plan, private investors are doing all of the heavy lifting.
MLS Stadium update: @ShermanSD7 likes plan. Waiting for more details but guessing a 60-40 possibility it could win city approval.
MLS Stadium update. Plan would set aside 16 acres for city to acquire to build NFL stadium.
@LobShots @PadresCentral I agree. They say complete renderings are still being complet d and will be revealed soon.
SDSU response: .. (cont.) and a plan for potential student housing and research facilities."
SDSU response: "Have had discussions, excited about reviewing complete proposal. Our priority is having a home for Aztec football..
MLS Stadium update: investors say city needs to act quickly because MLS application deadline is January 31st (yeah, real fast).
MLS Stadium update. HUGE point here. Investors say if city doesn't direct adopt (no public vote), they back out. It will be a deal breaker.
MLS Stadium update: investors say city must "direct adopt". If goes to a ballot vote, they will lose MLS bid.
MLS Stadium update. Investors putting pressure squarly on city council. Will gather signatures and ask city to "direct adopt" plan.
MLS Stadium update: investor group and city would split maintenance costs of proposed stadium.
MLS Stadium update: investors say plan would relieve city of millions of dollars of negative financial liability.
MLS Stadium update: SDSU asked to assume half of 200-million cost. Investors will then donate their half 5 years down the road.
MLS Stadium update: big challenge will be land acquisition. Land needs to be assessed for fair market value "to protect taxpayers."
MLS Stadium update: plan would also include "transit oriented development with student focused housing."
MLS Stadium update: have had discussion with SDSU for joint stadium "quite hopeful" about working with university.
MLS Stadium update: first step would be to develop 30 acres of River Park, no public expense. Would eventually total 55 (same as Measure D)
MLS Stadium update: plan would also include a stake in Mexican soccer league and bring a team to play here.
MLS Stadium update: Three investors insist no taxpayer money. Must file for MLS application by Jan 31st.
