Today the WTO released a report confirming what we've known for decades: China unfairly subsidizes its ag industry ($100 billion in a single year). Our ag producers will out-compete anyone on a level playing field and I appreciate @realDonaldTrump's efforts to level it.

The VA Accountability Act, passed by Congress and signed into law by @POTUS, was an important step forward in better serving and honoring our #veterans.
“Faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of the American life.” -@POTUS #SOTU
#Taxreform is already delivering: greater investment, higher wages and bonuses, and more robust employee benefits. Just the start of long-term economic growth we'll see under the new tax code. #SOTU
#Taxreform included repeal of #Obamacare individual mandate, allowing Americans to make their own health insurance decisions rather than having to seek federal gov approval or face a bill from the IRS. #SOTU
Manufacturing and #smallbiz optimism levels are among the highest in history, according to @ShopFloorNAM and @NFIB. As @POTUS has said, #taxreform is economic “rocket fuel.” #SOTU
Inspiring start to #SOTU with introductions of many American heroes who represent the spirit of our great country.

We can increase wages and grow the economy through #TaxReform, #Trade, and repealing #Obamacare. #SOTU
If the President is serious about helping the unemployed, he should consider dozens of House-passed bills #4jobs and economic growth. #SOTU
The President wants a 13th extension of "emergency" unemployment benefits – unpaid for, and with no reforms. http://t.co/yDIaEVuZuX #SOTU
The best way to help America's workers is through economic growth and opportunity – not the heavy hand of government. #SOTU
The President has already tried to stimulate the economy with massive deficit spending. It failed then, and would fail again. #SOTU
President's corporate #taxreform plan would reduce tax rates for big business – but not for hardworking individuals and families. #SOTU
True #taxreform would remove loopholes and use the savings to lower rates for both businesses and individuals. #SOTU
Any attempt to bypass Congress undermines the system of checks &amp; balances established by our founders in the Constitution. #SOTU
