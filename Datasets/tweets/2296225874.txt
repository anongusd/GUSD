ü§îWhat‚Äôs the difference between PrEP &amp; PEP? PrEP is not the same thing as PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis). PEP is a series of pills you can start taking	very soon after you‚Äôve been exposed to HIV that lowers your chances of getting it. #WomensHIVDay #NWGHAAD
ü§îü§îWhy is it important to talk about how HIV impacts women and girls?		Black and Latina women make up more than 80% of the population of women diagnosed with HIV since 2014 nationally. #WomensHIVDay #NWGHAAD https://t.co/0kGTyvhPcz
How can we protect ourselves from contracting HIV/AIDS?	You can take PrEP, a pill you take once a day that can help you prevent HIV. But you‚Äôll still need to use condoms too since PrEP doesn‚Äôt protect against other STIs or unintended pregnancy. #WomensHIVDay #NWGHAAD @PPNYCAction https://t.co/26FtrQJtpa
