Not everyone will understand what I am doing because what I am doing is not always for everyone to understand.
Please do not be offended if I am not following. My intentions are not to upset anyone.
@APartyNaBox1 After Xavier hooked us up I haven't been able to contact you. How are you, I lost your number. What is it?
How can I become a professional or expert without a college degree?
Can anyone get medals without being in the Olympics?
I gained too much weight. I was an athletic person that couldn't pass another Army Physical Fitness Test or APFT. My weight caused back and feet pain. While living with his mom my son lost weight in days, how was that medically possible? I will not specify which son or hospital.
@DorisMatsui @SMUDUpdates SMUD helped me when I served in Sacramento.
Please continue to support the Center for Father's and Families and invest in after school programs! https://t.co/j2rwFSKLWJ
I now serve globally via my YouTube partnership since 2011 while under my secret security clearance. I was ordered by the California County Courthouse to testify in court of my sponsors that aided my education including Washington, DC. Thanks 20th Century Fox and all my sponsor!
Even while going through family Court I not only "served" the County and City of Sacramento but also the State of California and the the entire Nation officially 2005-2013. I served every American!
Thank you Honorable Robert Matsui for representation of where I live and served.
Thank you Rick Jennings! https://t.co/C2pZl5a2fX
The Center for Father's and Families continues to help my sons plus their cousins. Thank you for being an inspirational medium.
Please remember the owner is a straight black male that tries to be respectful and sensitive to all humans.
Starting now Malbrue Business Solutions, LLC will focus on past/present/future servicemen and women. This includes their families too. The greater public can benefit indirectly regardless. The YouTube partnership will be open to cover any topic women are still the main objective.

@SanJuanUnified I advocated for teens as club president of my multicultural club I was a Public Speaker and student. I held open forums at various classrooms surveying responses of the predominantly Caucasian District without fear. I was welcomed and felt very comfortable with my peers.
@CasaRobleFB I was on the team I just couldn't afford the pads to play. Go Rams!
Only because I'm officially from the Army and joint operational Navy and Air Force. Past NJROTC, MCJROTC, and AFJROTC cadet.
Because I care about the community I was raised in I want to see recruitment efforts of every branch of service increase. That is South Sacramento which includes Oak Park. The ASVAB scores are too low mine was high.
@TRICARE Every account that I own and every comment is a request for help grandfathered. My family and I could have avoided many problems since our coverage began out of state. NIBRS/UCR please explain why their treatments were late and none got their military ID cards. E.F.M.P. denial

I want to bless my enemies and their children. I carry no resentment. Chances are they just needed help and knew no other recourse. Amen.

@FTC Spell check likes messing with me I see. I meant report. No need for redundancy my title says CEO News. Did you see the EEOC, EEO, and EO complaints I made to help women?
@FTC The strange part was she actually notified my Military Police chain of command. She basically told on herself. I found out when I reporter for duty in Sacramento at the Army Depot.
@FTC The first time the mother of my fifth child hacked my FBI research for college. This was after our baby died. And now this!
@FTC Hey Google!
@FTC Once again my Gmail account info/data is controlled by someone else and I have no clue the damages done. Since I'm a Media public figure from 2011 YouTube partnership under Media law in news. DAV VAPD
