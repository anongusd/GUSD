They could’ve approached any senator or rep. They chose someone that they believed would be resistant to them. They did it to create a spectacle. They did it to promote an agenda. Their public agenda and actions do not align and they are using children to push their agenda.		/2

With proof they don’t if you still believe immunizations cause autism tell me why your child dying from an easily preventable disease is preferable to having autism.		It tells me that in your eyes my son is lesser than. That autism is a fate worse than death. 		Seriously fuck you
My son has autism. He had issues from birth before one vaccine was administered. He had issues before his first MMR was administered. Vaccines neither caused nor amplified his autism. His autism just is. It’s a neurological glitch just like his ADHD and epilepsy are glitches.
Vaccines do not cause autism. 		If you still believe that debunked falsified study move to a remote island and take the rest of the antivaxxers with you. 		Your stupidity and lack of concern for your fellow human beings deserves to be ostracized. https://t.co/TtXMtLP0TU

PTSD does not define me it’s just a part of me. Autism doesn’t defined my son it’s just a part of him. Whatever label you carry it’s just a part of you it’s not all of you. My motto has always been “you got what you got now deal with it” and that is what I’m doing. 		/4 https://t.co/qRgn2Bf1H1
People fear labels. But being labeled can actually open up a world for you. When my son was diagnosed with autism at six so many programs opened up for him that weren’t available before the label. Don’t fear labels it’s just information to help you treat accurately.		/3 https://t.co/waoluWIZHU
This diagnosis is a lifelong diagnoses. This is something I will deal with until the day I die. But knowing that makes it easier. People shouldn’t be afraid of labels. This is what I have and now I can deal with it. It doesn’t define me. It’s just a part of me. 		/2 https://t.co/pi0j47cDnX
