@existentialcoms @DemSocialists Because the intellectual capital of some of these “billionaires” created the opportunity for “other people’s labor” to even be exercised. Because  they incurred the PERSONAL RISK over a life time of creating a business that created labor opportunity. Because from a macroeconomic.
@SenFeinstein Life has winners and losers because individuals win and loose throughout their life. Why does the Marxist kaleidoscope allow one to play god and rewrite the master equation as they see fit? Contractors know the risk of doing business! There is no life without risk. Risk is human.

@molds699 @David_Gergen @CNN @AC360 @Acosta That was a question not a comment. Questions are what lead to enlightenment. There are no stupid questions. But I apologize for triggering you.
@Acosta Shouldn’t we all take a strong stance against dishonesty?
@David_Gergen @CNN @AC360 @Acosta Shouldn’t we all unite together against dishonest individuals and organizations?
@DanRather @CNN @Acosta We the people seek truth and facts from our nation’s journalists and for that reason journalist should be held to higher standard of honestly. A provocative narrative based off individual bias is not journalism.

Knowing where your Gucci hand bag or expensive eye liner came from is great but I think giving confidence back to the consumer that our food and baby products are safe and reliable is a bigger priority. ***VET/VET, WTC but most importantly WABI***
@wabiico It does not seem like any RFI platform is focusing on the safety of the consumer like Walimai. It is truly business to person (B2P) centered. Vechain and Walton are fantastic companies but their focus is on tracking/logistics and NOT product tampering.
@doschain In my opinion it does not seem like any RFI platform is focusing on the safety of the consumer like Walimai is. It is truly business to person (B2P) centered. Vechain and Walton  is a great companies but their focus is more on (B2B) tracking and logistics NOT product tampering.
