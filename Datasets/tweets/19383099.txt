I vividly recall that crossing, partly because I looked such a fool, but most of all because it embodied the amazing generosity and tenacity of the people who lived through the quake. Mr. Mu remarried, had another child, and I often think of him and other survivors at this time. https://t.co/LsPMOsScWx
I was stumbling and tripping, and Mr. Mu, who had just visited his wife's grave, jumped back into the current and cheerfully pulled me across like a helpless child. We laughed -- me less heartily than them -- and David took a photo so that you can laugh at me too. (5)
David and Mr. Mu strode across the river and I stripped down to do the same. But I'm a weakling and the current was stronger than I expected. (David told me it would be a cinch.) So that's how I ended up struggling in the middle of the river. (4)
He agreed and we walked with Mr. Mu to his wife's grave in dense undergrowth near the river, and observed -- and tried to hold back tears -- as he knelt before her grave. He invited us to cross the river with him to visit his destroyed home, and now it gets embarrassing. (3)
We came upon Mr. Mu, who was going to pay his respects for the first time at the grave of his wife, who died in their home in the quake. Miraculously, his late wife saved their child, who was found huddled under her in their crushed home. We respectfully asked to join him. (2)
I will share a treasured memory of the Sichuan earthquake 10 years ago, which I helped cover for Reuters. In the aftermath of the quake me and my great friend David Gray walked up the valley near Chenjiaba Town, which was close to destroyed by the quake. (1)

It's extraordinary how when the party decides to put China's main tv and radio broadcasters under one name -- "Voice of China" -- this is treated as some great jump in global influence. In itself it's a kind of propaganda coup.

Another thing about China's constitutional change: president will serve for the duration of the National People's Congress, which is 5 years except in extreme circumstances. So that seems to count against the idea that Xi could hang on for just a couple of years, like Jiang did.

The new CCTV propaganda about Xi Jinping is interesting not only because it hints that he may come from another planet, but also because it promotes the term "family-state realm" (家国天下) with Xi as the father of the nation. https://t.co/fQR5UfdrSC https://t.co/ie6Sqb4aFZ

@niubi @LizEconomy Political scientists should debate about how much of the change has been driven by broader changes that may not have much to do with Xi himself. But as the outcome of the19th congress showed, pointing at words or practices to prove that Xi is just more of same, misses too much.
@niubi @LizEconomy Notice, for example, how the language of "weiwen" 维稳 that was widespread under Hu has receded. It was an outlook that smacked of protecting the status quo. Now in many domestic areas, Xi's govt. has moved much more actively to redraw the boundaries of what is acceptable.
@niubi @LizEconomy It almost goes without saying that Xi has pursued his policies, including in domestic control, often with the tools already at hand, and that his predecessor were no liberals. But all the same, to treat the past 5 years as a linear extension of the Hu years misses too much.
