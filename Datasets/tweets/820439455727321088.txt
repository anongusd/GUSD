The Bruce Arians here is an awesome hire. Proven HC. The opposite of the Kingsbury hire. Solid HC who will hit the ground running. Well done #Bucs.
Hiring Kingsbury doesn’t seem like a #Cardinals move. It feels like a #Jets move. It feels like a move that a perpetually terrible franchise makes, not a decent ownership/front office team. Very very confused.
Kliff Kingsbury is the guy who went 5-7 with Mahomes. He is clearly a great recruiter. But, has anyone told the #Cardinals that there’s no recruiting in the #NFL? Has anyone told them that this is an enormous promotion for a below average college HC and above average college OC.
Kliff Kingsbury has a losing coaching record.....in college. Now, the #Cardinals want to promote him? Good OC who was fired as an HC. He is the guy that gets to run an #NFL franchise? Count me in as confused.

And a final point for the record, letting Williams go would be the most #Browns move that could possibly be made. You have a good thing going and it’s ruined. Make the HC! He did very well in his audition and deserves a full shot. He will get one somewhere!
Gregg Williams has not had a perfect career, but the past few mos. have been close to perfect. He took a rookie QB and decent d and made them a legitimate threat heading into next season. There’s excitement in Cleveland. They have a swagger. Part of that has to be Williams.
Just for the record, Gregg Williams should have the #Browns HC job and if he doesn’t, he should have an HC job. He took a team that was 0-16 to a near playoff birth. Yes, he was not the only reason (new players, turnover, etc.). But, still quite the accomplishment.
