The witness couldn’t be sure that her accusation was correct so she called around to confirm her suspicions. Finding no other first-hand witnesses, she spent 6 days “assessing her memories” w/the hope that they'd tell her what preceding 35 years could not. https://t.co/B3ZV4F6g4b

Cuomo's abuse of his office was exceptional and indisputable but, with no apparent shame, he accused *his opponent* of abusing the public trust. https://t.co/5AooL1v18c
Cuomo didn't hide political use of taxpayer funds. He ran on it. "I did more for upstate New York from Washington than the [Pataki] administration has done from Albany." https://t.co/5AooL1v18c
"In his final 13 months as HUD secretary, Cuomo made 46 official trips. More than half of those—25—were to New York. California, his second favorite destination, saw Cuomo 4 times in the same period."	https://t.co/5AooL1v18c
From July 2001: As Bill Clinton's HUD Secretary, Cuomo "showered his home state—particularly the electorally important upstate region—with federal dollars, and essentially used HUD as his gubernatorial campaign headquarters." https://t.co/5AooL1v18c
Cuomo has been shamelessly using taxpayer dollars to promote his own political interests for two decades. https://t.co/5AooL1v18c

The "realists" of the Trump administration are engaged in the same kind of wishful thinking and self-delusion that led to the failure of Obama's efforts in Afghanistan. We should expect the same result.	https://t.co/QMp22WEa5i
"The Taliban can only view the Trump administration’s attempts to negotiate as further evidence that the president’s patience is running out."	https://t.co/QMp22WEa5i
"The Obama administration’s attempts to negotiate with the Taliban will be remembered as among the most embarrassing episodes in the history of American diplomacy. So why is the Trump administration going down the same path?"	https://t.co/QMp22WEa5i
"It’s no wonder the Obama administration and its allies in the intelligence bureaucracy fought hard to keep the [bin Laden] files from public view."	https://t.co/QMp22WEa5i
Documents captured in the raid on bin Laden's compound show that his same Taliban official "raised money for al Qaeda. The records show a transfer of proceeds from a donor (presumably in the Gulf) through Agha and into al Qaeda’s coffers."	https://t.co/QMp22WEa5i
The Clinton State Department's main liaison for "peace" talks, Tayib Agha, was, unbeknownst to the Obama team, simultaneously communicating with al Qaeda leadership.	https://t.co/QMp22WEa5i
The detailed history of Obama's diplomatic failures in Afghanistan provided here is the just devastating. Self-delusion and public relations masquerading as policy.	https://t.co/QMp22WEa5i

#Packers fans are understandably fond of McCarthy on a personal level. By all accounts a good guy. But with the talent they've had, in a perennially weak division, they've vastly underperformed. Clock is ticking on @AaronRodgers12 career. #moveon
One of the NFL's all-time great QBs. A stream of Pro-Bowl O-linemen. Talent at playmaking positions. But a 10-8 playoff record. Obsessively conservative playcalling. Just one Super Bowl. Multiple epic playoff collapses.  #Packers

@NPRinskeep I don’t feel I “must” defend it. I found it interesting, found the broad critique compelling, and tweeted it with my comment. Glad NPR covered it; if that coverage was misrepresented, it shouldn’t have been. The story hasn’t gotten the attention it merits from mainstream media.
@NPRinskeep I don't - not more bias. Is that a problem, too? Of course. But I don't think that happened here. The story credited Politico for breaking the story and discussed some NPR coverage (critically). Then it offers evidence to support the broader critique.
