#MarriedAtFirstSigh Saw previews for next wk, Jasmine u r a special kind of stupid!U asked Will a question, but b/c ur a?&amp; knows everything,“coaching does pay”.REALLY dum-dum! Ask Rick Pitino, $7.7M to coach. Jasmine you are a royal 👑 idiot!
@MAFSLifetime Smack yourself Jasmine!Once again “foot in mouth”! Never ask a question u don’t really want an honest answer! ...Girl, your gonna be single again in three weeks if u don’t change ur funky attitude (FYI)!
@CalvinRoberson Sir with all due respect, that is absolute BS! ....this is beyond challenging.Kate doesn’t need u to tell her she is strong!Her strength is blatantly obvious.Likewise,Luke’s weaknesses are abusive &amp; disturbing!
@KCoustic Katie, 1 is generous! I was think 🤔 more like -3. And that is grading on a curve

@thehill Great article @yoniapplebaum! Yet a sad reality Gov’t ppl 45s collateral damage while US citizens under domestic hostage for our 🇺🇸 constitutional democracy.... 🤬😭😡
@YAppelbaum Just read your article “The Case for Impeachment.” Excellent!A comprehensive historic articulation to the “why’s “ of impeachment process now. Does Congress know they have the authority to constrain 45? Facetious, but not? ...S/b req reading!
@NatashaBertrand @JoyAnnReid I’m confused,some accuse Mueller(report)&amp;JD of being biased/witch hunt against 45.But now u w/t wait for the report to determine the next https://t.co/puK8IwVtXM,JD nor Mueller adjudicates Presidential conduct. Legislative Branch has its own 2/3 process!?#ImpeachTrump #censure
@JoaquinCastrotx @BuzzFeed When/how do(es) you &amp; or your committee determine there’s sufficient empirical evidence of presidential corruption? How long should our 🇺🇸democracy suffer?
@mandjstephenson @AynRandPaulRyan @johnpavlovitz Fact Check: The last time she smiled was @ John McCain’s funeral. 🍊wasn’t invited!
@ChangemakerPR @AynRandPaulRyan @FLOTUS Sorry but we can’t accept 🇷🇺The Ruble!
@thehill Stating the obvious!Most Americans agree 45 actions are ALWAYS inappropriate,condescending, contrary to our Constitution (juvenile) etc. What are the consequences? ...Censure?!? 🤷🏾‍♀️ Plz move the needle!
@peterdaou @IlhanMN DC/CH politics is slimy!,&amp; has been for decades!But it has functioned in its dysfunction for same decades!Fact not Fiction!Conseq,this is why we have a Pres/Cabinet etc. jockeying for advantage/lies NOT promote integrity etc. ...So sorry u become fresh 🥩 to political Puranas!😭
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump 🍊wasn’t worthy of being a US presidential candidate! He repeated showed another level of his deplorable character since 1973, yet here we are swimming in sludge upstream(expecting something miraculous different)...DISGRACEFUL &amp; counting!😡
@TheTylt #ChicagoMed !!!

@MSNBC Obstruction +Collusion + Perjury (contrary to 45) = #article II/section IV Impeachment ...”...Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.”	—U.S. Constitution, Article II, section 4
@NewYorker @BorowitzReport Should we be surprised 😲. This behavior (criminal activity) is his character 😡👺🤬!!!
@TODAYshow 🥳 Happy Birthday 🍷Mrs. Michelle Obama🎂!💐💐💐

@cspan @RepPressley Good for you!Thank you for reminding colleagues of their oath(like 45)to “protect&amp;defend our constitution...”. I applaud your brazen opposition to the fallacy of phantom nat’l crisis!Its equivalent to “weapons of mass destruction”US never saw!😡💩🤬
@maziehirono I’ve known 45 is a liar for two yrs, but yet w/ blatant abuse of power (amongst many other constitutional/ethical/moral violations) Capitol Hill acts powerless. I’m sick of listening to the rhetoric!!!🥵🤬🤮👺😡 #ImpeachTrump
