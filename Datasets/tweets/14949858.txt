@AlexMLeo We are also having a cultural reckoning about how women are perceived in the context of power. I'm concerned that important context is missing in the assessment of Klobuchar.
@emilycrockett @pareene I find it horrific that after 2016 the DC press is completely willing to write up how a powerful woman has long been considered a bitch behind the scenes without any level of self awareness.
RT @BrandyLJensen: @lkmcgann lol I feel extremely bad for anyone who works with you
@ryangrim @samstein I think that they faithfully reported what they were told. That is not the same as being objective. I think there's a problem in journalism around questions of bias and one of them is this exact thing.
@DanteAtkins @pareene The actual point about Klobuchar-as-husband is that she is not in that role. She is not her staff's life partner. That's a different set of expectations.
@DanteAtkins @pareene The highest volume of complaints and examples of humiliation are about being told their work is "the worst," including policy briefings and press releases.
@joshuarolson Yes, I assign work to people who work for me. I expect them to do it well. I am not their life partner.
@pareene No. Your husband doesn't get to make the decisions and assign you work. That's abuse. A U.S. senator gets to make decisions and assign her staff work. It's not the same relationship.
@mattdpearce This is not my stated belief on labor relations. It's my stated belief that a senator gets to make decisions. She gets to ask her staff to do things. A married couple shouldn't operate that way.
@samstein TBH -- I can't get into who I have and have not spoken to. I will not pretend I put in anywhere the same kind of reporting time on this as Molly or Amanda, but I'm not out in the wild on this, either.
@samstein I misunderstood your point about male bosses and accountability. Sorry about that. You mean "more" in general.
@samstein Huh? How is this saying male bosses should be more accountable? My point is that the behavior of male leaders is seen through a lens that values a set of characteristics, which, when a woman displays hurt her. So while workers for a woman feel abused, workers for a man do not.
@ryangrim @samstein I find it troubling that the list of "worst bosses" includes 7 female offices out of 10.  Are those experiences substantially different? Or are staff interpreting experiences one way when it's a woman and another when it's a man.
@ryangrim @samstein I agree that the staffers say they feel victimized. They feel it deeply. I don't dispute that. I don't dispute that the reporters faithfully captured what these staffers say. I question whether biases aren't shaping the interpretation of events inside Klobuchar's office.
@samstein One reason I'm skeptical of the objectivity of reporters is that almost every article mentions the "worst boss" list but does not mention that it's a list of 7 female senators and 3 male senators. Why is it that women have such disproportionate turnover?
@samstein My point is not that reporters didn't report what they were told accurately. My point is that the same biases that lead to a pile-on of staffers interpreting her behavior through a gendered lens affects all of us, including reporters.
@RTKash This kind of thing: https://t.co/miRlEDAs3p
@SocietalCanary @BillTaylorMA @voxdotcom One way to look at this: Klobuchar is cutthroat. She wants to keep her best staff. Instead, we hear how she is "vindictive." The root objection is that she put herself and her ambitions first. That's a big no no for women.
@emilycrockett @DanteAtkins I believe that these people felt bad. But if the reason you feel bad is because you really hate that a female boss told you your work isn't good enough, that's not OK, in my mind. The criticism keeps women out of leadership roles.
@emilycrockett @DanteAtkins @Hegemommy Right...I heard the nasty rumors, too, most of which were never substantiated despite "everyone" knowing they were true. The glee in which these stories were repeated was gross.
@emilycrockett @DanteAtkins No boss should throw stuff or threaten to fire someone on an thread. But does that mean she is such a terrible manager that she should be ousted from national politics? I am having trouble saying that based on the totality of the situation.
@emilycrockett @DanteAtkins The point of my article is that we're talking about this situation as if it's possible to be objective. As if it's possible to see this as, you say, a "yes or no" situation. We're shaped by unspoken gender biases that set different expectations for female bosses.
The fact that people are comparing her to behaving badly in the domestic realm is also interesting to me.
A number of people have raised how Klobuchar's behavior would be received if she were a husband treating her wife this way. It would be considered controlling. Here's the difference: She is a boss. She is in charge. Working for someone is not about being an equal partner.
@kofcarrotflower @BillTaylorMA @voxdotcom Just to rewind the tape: I think that Bernie did give a real apology and is taking steps to change how his campaign runs this time. My point is just to say that the criticism isn't just about his public persona, but his management.
@emilycrockett @DanteAtkins This reminds me of Howell Raines. After he was ousted over Jayson Blair, the "wow, he was an asshole" stories appeared. He wasn't on the rocks for his management.
@WorstPlace @shutupjaya I pointed to that behavior as important context alongside reports of systemic underpayment of female staff and a culture of harassment.
@_allisonc @thegarance Didn't make the "worst boss" list.
@BillTaylorMA @voxdotcom The person hit by the binder says it wasn't thrown at her. It's still very bad. But let's be clear about the accusations. Thea apocrypha around her is extreme.
@leslieleeiii As I say in my piece, I wouldn't demand someone who worked for me fetch me a fork. That's ridiculous. But in the context of a Senate job. It's not. I work in journalism not politics. I wouldn't care to work on any campaign.
@shutupjaya That's not what was reported. What was reported is she tried to prevent poaching. I do not agree with what she did. But that's not the same thing.
@DanteAtkins @emilycrockett 1 -- I do say that some of this is not acceptable at all.  2 -- Yes, I am questioning the interpretation of some of this behavior. I'm in disagreement.
@BrianoMobile @leslieleeiii I'm referring to her staffers quoted in these articles.
@leslieleeiii Men and women like successful women less. I do question whether the staff held fair expectations of what they should get from their boss.
@emilycrockett @DanteAtkins Republican Tim Murphy was pushed out over forcing his girlfriend to get an abortion. I'm not sure how that relates? Bernie underpaid his staff and allowed harassment? Rahm used to lit into White House staff with profanity? Even Obama joked about it as a good thing.
@cmjo1251 Check out who else is on the (old) list: six additional female senators. Three male senators. That means a third of female senators are worse bosses than 96% male senators. So...while I'm sure those staffers working for women were all unhappy, I think we should reflect on why.
@kofcarrotflower @BillTaylorMA @voxdotcom And: https://t.co/tyQXnjE0Zz
@kofcarrotflower @BillTaylorMA @voxdotcom Here's a video: https://t.co/Hr3UyEwBgO
@BillTaylorMA @voxdotcom Systematically underpaying half your staff because they are women vs. throwing a binder in the air (not at anyone) because you think a policy briefing is crap? Yes. I think they are both very bad. Neither should happen. But only one of these people is in real political danger.
@shutupjaya This is not an endorsement. Look up my past work on DiFi if it's not clear.
@LouRovegno It would be great if we had an entirely different set of values around leadership.
@shutupjaya My point is that she is focused on herself and not playing the expected role of caretaker. She is the boss. She has political ambitions. She is not playing a domestic role and for that she is punished.
@cmjo1251 She's dropped on the list, but for some reason that stat is not mentioned. Every article has used the old data. The list she's on includes ten senators. Seven women.
@DanteAtkins As I say in my article, I do believe them. Some of this behavior is wrong. But it is also wrong to accuse someone of being a monster unfairly in an attempt to derail her political career.
@BillTaylorMA @voxdotcom I disagree. Ie: Bernie Sanders yells, he shushed Hillary on a debate stage, he underpaid female staff. I'm not indicting him. I thought his pay apology was sincere. I raise it to show why I'm skeptical that there's nothing else going on with Klobuchar.
@DaveClark_AFP That's why I'd be ticked off with the person who lost my fork, too.
@shutupjaya We've heard she threw a binder in the air. We heard that she was cutthroat in KEEPING her staff. The apocrypha around this is another reason I'm skeptical that this is divorced from gender.
@11twiggins My point is that we need to change what we value in leaders.  Until then, women will be at a huge disadvantage.
@shutupjaya Please read my whole thread/my piece. The point isn't whataboutism. I'm questioning the premise that she is objectively abusive.
I don't doubt that it was be horrible to be on the receiving end of some of these stories. But does it all add up to Klobuchar is an abusive monster? I'm dubious that the voices we're hearing and the authors we're reading are as objective as they want to be.
At least half a dozen articles have pointed out that Klobuchar topped a list of "worst bosses" in Congress in 2017. Who else was on the top ten? Six other female senators. So a third of female senators are worse bosses than 96% of all male senators?
And while some of Klobuchar's behavior sounds legitimately bad -- every worker is entitled to baseline respect (and shouldn't fear flying office supplies) -- a lot of it is...really kind of small and petty. The aggregate vitriol is a red flag waving around.
It's not just that we don't hear about men being rude or mean that makes these stories suspiciously sexist. It's that when Bernie screams or Rahm throws a tantrum or Bill Clinton turns purple, the stories prop up positive cases to support them.
The qualities that make Klobuchar a bad boss -- she's aggressive, demanding, direct and ambitious -- would be held up as reasons to admire a male leader. https://t.co/jgpb20Lo7o

@MeghanMcCarthy_ Are these people making an honest object decision? Studies show men and women prefer a male boss. Is that bias at play here? I can't tell.
It's hard for me to conclude, at this point, that the case against Klobuchar is strong enough to read as disqualifying.
I don't know. But I do know that studies show again and again that men AND women prefer to work for a man. Men AND women like women less the more successful they become. Men AND women use different words to describe positive leadership qualities in male and female leaders.
I just can't tell from these accounts whether Klobuchar is the monster people claim. Did she throw a folder in the air once? Does that make her abusive? Did she send 20 mean emails late at night over the course of six years in office? Is that a fair indictment?
This is the intersection of two big themes we've seen emerge in politics in recent years: abuse of power (sexual harassment and harassment generally on the Hill and a culture of silence that perpetuates it).  It also hits the question of how we perceive women as leaders.
On the second point: Ubiquity doesn't make something right. So if she's the beginning of public accountability, maybe that's a good thing. But, if she's actually just being flayed because of sexist stereotypes and this isn't the beginning of anything larger, that gives me pause.
On Klobuchar: There are a few issues to suss out. First, there's the question of whether or not the media's conclusion that she unleashes wrath and seriously mistreats staff is fair, objectively. Second, is it fair relative to the customs politics.

@jbenton @vosdscott I thought about this as I read an accountability piece in @washingtonpost this morning. Yes, they are a business and I'm buying a subscription. But I really am paying them to shine a light on how justice is or isn't being carried out in DC. It wouldn't happen without the Post.
We make it look too easy.
The problem is that women know coming forward is misery. Even in a case like this where there's DNA evidence, a confession and many victims, still the woman does not get justice. Why report? It's better to keep our heads down, do our best at our jobs and in our lives.
To that I say: these men almost never have one victim. They've victimized many women. What have we ALREADY lost? Who isn't contributing because of this behavior? It's already happening.
There's a reflexive question I hear quite a lot from all kinds of people about what to do about these men. Do they all lose their jobs? Do they all go to jail? How would that possibly work?
What about the careers of the victims? Disclosure: I'm a client of the crusader in this story. She's a tremendous talent and successful in her field. But where would she be if she hadn't spent years fighting for justice for herself and for the safety of women in DC?

TL;DR I hope journalism is around and competitive for a long while. I hope our methods to keep it going work. I hope audience likes rethinking subscriptions as support. I hope they see the value in collaboration. I hope it doesn‚Äôt backfire.
We also accept that while we are figuring it out, leaning on nonpartisan foundations who value journalism as a civic good is hugely valuable.
My conclusion is not to say it‚Äôs good or bad, but that it just is. The old subscription model isn‚Äôt resonating with audiences anymore. We need that revenue stream. And we are trying to build that loyal audience however we can.

@nhmeems The accusations date back to 1992 -- when he was president.
If you're going to have only one joke you use to set up digging your hand into an unsuspecting woman's flesh, might as well make it a good one.
From a factual accuracy perspective, "David-Cop-A-Feel" isn't a good lewd joke. Even if you don't want to talk about the assault that went with it, we should at least be able to face the fact that the guy was not funny.
It's embarrassing how eager the media is to portray HW as a fun-loving guy who told jokes and wore wacky socks, while not mentioning his other joke -- the one he whispered to women as he groped them. https://t.co/F2Up9CAkvE https://t.co/LDaaMh3DJd
The rare LinkedIn commenter https://t.co/PMyxUmZ5gS
@laura_polesky @CanofPineapple I disagree with the assessment of "by all accounts." Read what women who were groped had to say about it. (Behavior that his spokesman confirms happened.) There was a side to HW Bush that we should remember, even if it makes us uncomfortable.
This critique is accurate: I write articles hoping people will click on them and read them. It's not a secret plot.
@xiruxi @DarrellBenefiel Your reaction is part of why I think it's important to note this. I think the accusations were under-covered because they didn't fit our existing positive impressions of HW, some of which can very much be true at the same time.
@DarrellBenefiel @xiruxi My writing on these issues spans the political spectrum.
@Siggihreins The first accusation is from 1992, when he was president.
@skzdalimit @voxdotcom I'll have words then, too. Rest assured.

@nikkiusher @HotlineJosh @ng007007 @BenjySarlin @CillizzaCNN @Hadas_Gold Your research on gender breakdowns inside Washington journalism revealed a huge problem that seems really difficult to solve. What you're talking about here is even tougher.
@nikkiusher @HotlineJosh @ng007007 @BenjySarlin @CillizzaCNN @Hadas_Gold I wouldn't look at this and say it's good. It just doesn't strike me as a problem unique to the media industry.

@nikkiusher @ng007007 @HotlineJosh @BenjySarlin @CillizzaCNN @Hadas_Gold People also do tweet by topic area -- enviro twitter, econ twitter, feminist twitter.

The Democratic Party is theparty of #metoo . It's time to face history and accept that what Bill Clinton did was wrong.
Personally, I don't see how the leader of the free world can have an affair with a 22-year-old intern without an inherent power problem. Hell, a middle manager at a run-of-the-mill office couldn't.
No. No one was asking whether Clinton abused his power. That would have been a valid question to ask! And I hope that would be the frame today.

@AlexParkerDC Oh and to clarify: Shining a light doesn't solve the problem, as you're pointing out. You would think it would (ie: the Catholic Church). I  mean that when outsiders look in at these hidden decisions they are so clearly wrong.
@AlexParkerDC Yeah. I'm agreeing with you. It's incredibly frustrating because the solutions aren't rocket science. But institutions won't reform.
@AlexParkerDC We‚Äôve stamped out entire diseases, reduced crime, war and global poverty (25% in just the last decade). These efforts required a decision to reject the thinking that we can‚Äôt be better. Firing child rapists feels like an easy mindset to change in comparison.
It‚Äôs so obviously stupid. When authorities show you reams of documents. When children say they are being harmed. Do something! Don‚Äôt rush to protect him. There are so many complex problems that we need to solve. I can‚Äôt express my frustration enough at this waste of time.
When we shine a light on the situation it‚Äôs always absurd. Protecting a man who is good at reading a TelePrompTer, or throwing a ball, or snapping photos or, in this case, finding children who need help? These skills are so special they justify rape?
Institutions of every kind have proven willing and eager to protect a man perceived as Important.

Alexander is being intellectually dishonest in his explanation of why he isn't troubled by Ford's allegations. Instead of just saying what he thinks, he's hiding behind language used by #metoo.
Alexander sums this all up as "she said/they said," a term at the heart of the #metoo movement and coverage. Individually women aren't believed, but groups of victims can't be discredited so easily. (The NYT ran a tv ad during awards season to this very effect.) https://t.co/TRnBCK2rCr
The final "they" is Keyser. She says she does not remember the party, nor does she recall meeting Kavanaugh in high school. She also said Ford never told her about an assault. (Ford says she didn't, either.)
The remaining "theys" are Kavanaugh and Judge's friend PJ Smyth and Keyser. Ford says Smyth was downstairs, though she doesn't allege that he would have known about the assault. Smyth says he doesn't remember such a party.
Now there's "they said." Mark Judge isn't really a "they," since Ford accused him of participating in the assault. But it seems like that's how Alexander categorizes him.  Judge denies the allegation.
Alexander's "He said" is Kavanaugh. Kavanaugh denies the allegations.
Since I'm worked up, let's go through it. The "She said" -- That's Ford. We know her allegations. Included in her testimony, she named four people who she recalls at the event that night: Kavanaugh, Mark Judge, PJ Smyth and  Leland Keyser.
Lamar Alexander, Susan Collins, and pretty much the entire Republican caucus say Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh should be counted as Ford's named "witnesses." I guess two "witnesses" denied the account is better than "the two men accused of a felony" denied the account. https://t.co/UEWvdkQ30J

Many people say Kavanaugh never tried to rape them.
Collins seems to be arguing that the best outcome here would have been if we had never heard from Ford.
Collins had no idea that long-time friends of hers were victims of sexual attacks, but she seems to think that people who attended a party should have known about Ford's.
Collins believes we should look at the credibility of the accuser. But not the accused or the alleged witnesses who defended him.

When men tell us what they believe, they are telling us who they are. Let's take them at their word.
I understand why we go to great lengths to say that when men joke about sexual assault or when they demean women, it's just words. If all men who said these things actually did them...good God! We'd have an epidemic on our hands. The reality is that we do.
We also know that Trump does not take sexual assault seriously. It's in his books, it's on an Access Hollywood tape, it's in his divorce records, it's in the stories of a dozen women who have accused him of it.
Plus, Trump is in the middle of trying to save Kavanaugh's nomination. We know this is at the top of his to-do list.
I've seen the argument around that Trump mocked Ford to distract from the NYT blockbuster on his tax fraud. Usually I agree that Trump's approach to bad news is distraction. But in this case, how is looking pro-rape better than looking like a tax cheat?

The fact that the Bill Clinton saga became about the wrong issues and he wasn‚Äôt held accountable for his actual wrong doing is not a reason to keep doing it.

Kavanaugh claims Devil's Triangle is a drinking game, which, pretty much no one thinks is the honest answer. He just didn't want to own up to the fact that he used to joke about the kind of situation Ford said he was in.
I've been reflecting on Kavanaugh's tetimony. Kavanaugh and his friends liked to joke about two men and one women in a sexual situation enough to include it in his yearbook. Dr. Ford testified that Kavanaugh and his friend laughed as they sexually humiliated her.

Is this Ed Whelan's twitter feed?
Is this how Mitchell usually questions sexual assault accusers when she is prosecuting their attacker?
This is a cross examination.
If the FBI didn't turn up questions about Kavanaugh six different times, maybe it's worth a look at whether the bureau's process does enough to check on the possible history of domestic or sexual violence.

@helaineolen Right. All kinds of communities have covered up this kind of conduct for the sake of community image -- Catholic parishes, towns like Stuebenville, universities...
This criticism of the piece is not an indictment of these reporters, whose work admire, but a note of disappointment.  There's a very important story here they discovered and I wish they'd been encouraged by an editor to explore it with more skepticism.
There must be advocates out there who are familiar with the phenomenon of insular communities covering up sexual assault who could place it in context and point out that not everyone accepts this at face value.
However, I do wish they'd framed the story around how it is a problem that even in an educated community that sends their kids to elite (and religious) schools, sexual assault victims aren't supported.
I initially hoped  @DanielLippman and @SchreckReports just got the story wrong. I'd prefer not to live a few miles down wind from a cabal of rich and powerful people who let victims of crime suffer in silence to keep up an image. But that seems unlikely given their past work.
Maybe it's too much to suggest that these "power" families consider their shared goal "to avoid public embarrassment." But it would be great if they thought about stamping out sexual abuse, rather than advocating to cover it up through silence.
I didn't grow up in the burbs two miles outside of D.C., so I can't definitively speak firsthand to this morally bankrupt culture that considers speaking out against rape as a violation of a code, while, say, attempted rape is not. 		https://t.co/XMnq7vGO5e https://t.co/caXpf1KQdm

What is this ‚Äúfbi investigation,‚Äù anyway? Is it part of a background check? Is this a criminal investigation? Can senators ask the FBI to check stuff out for them? Shouldn‚Äôt the committee investigate?
@TianaTheFirst Right. That‚Äôs supposed to be the point of a closed door hearing, a public hearing and an fbi background check. In this case, it seems like DiFi has a chance to do something before K was nominated. Instead she sat on it. It‚Äôs horrifying.
But I don‚Äôt accept that the only course was to go nothing.
Ford says she was ambivalent about how she wanted to proceed. Feinstein‚Äôs office said that is why the senator did not tell anyone about the accusations, including other democrats or the fbi.
I wrote about DiFi before Ford went public. Feinstein‚Äôs belief that it would be better to stick to Kavanaugh‚Äôs legal background and not his ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù life is even more horrifying to me now that we‚Äôve heard more details of the accusation.  https://t.co/ULKbVoPEEV

6. If the accusations are true, did he change? This is a question worth raising. We have a right to know what a supreme court justice thinks about sexual abuse, given he will be in a position to shape the law.
5. Kavanaugh was very likely a minor at the time of the alleged incident. Should he have been tried as an adult then? Probably not. Should a kid get a chance to change? Yes.
4. On the matter of the age of the accusations: Sexual assault can do life long harm. We‚Äôve seen this in the Catholic Church abuse and many others. Just because there was no responsibility taken doesn‚Äôt excuse the crime however long ago.
3. For everyone who has said it‚Äôs just her word, it‚Äôs not. She alleges there was a witness present in the room. The alleged witness told the New Yorker he does not recall. He doesn‚Äôt deny her claim.

If it is credible, it shouldn't be dismissed out of hand because the crime allegedly happened in a bedroom and not a courtroom.
There are plenty of legitimate reasons not to immediately go public with an accusation like this, including is it credible?
How can we trust Kavanaugh to shape the law around sexual assault (he'll surely hear a case in his lifetime) if it turns out he doesn't think the behavior is wrong?

FYI @awprokop @dylanlscott @DLind @libbyanelson @EmilyStewartM are reading Omarosa's book so you don't have to. Public service journalism at its finest. Highlights on the way.
@AdavisWilliams There's a bias toward newness in media that I don't think is always great, either. It's not new that Trump uses race to build and maintain his power. But it's very important.
If there's an N-word tape. I want to see it. I want the world to see it. Stories that expose resonate. But ultimately, it doesn't change what we see every day. Trump's words and actions tell us the same story.
What Trump says is a REAL story. His tweets are usually bizarre or dishonest or hateful.  Today he twice compared people to animals. The beliefs of our president are sitting right there for all of us to see.
But I also get into it with other journalists regularly on Trump tweets. Why are we giving them any oxygen? Why are we pouncing on ridiculousness? Focus on the REAL stories.
There are many reporters doggedly reporting on Trump family graft and agency-level self dealing. (Thank you)
I get it. Accountability journalism is supposed to be about uncovering what's really going on in Washington. Whose voice is heard behind the scenes? Who is benefiting and how is the public spun to accept it?
But the bias toward what Trump says in secret is a problem overall. Trump's immigration policies, visa policies, refugee policies, SNAP, health care, etc. tell us plenty about what he thinks of people who aren't white. He ran on a platform of putting whites (and the rich) first.
If Donald Trump uses the N-word, it is a significant story. No single word carries the same weight of the worst of our history. No handful of letters is so hateful. Many many others put this more eloquently: https://t.co/htjUJhSZQD

So while I understand this instinct not to want to go too far, as many fear the #metoo movement will. I'll go on the record and say that, yes, as a manager,  I do want to hear about that time he touched your arm.
But we've seen this behavior again and again in cases that wind up out of control. At an event I attended on sexual harassment in the media, @irin @AmyJBrittain talked about how Charlie Rose had a similar pattern.
That is the whole point of the behavior. Initial steps don't seem "that bad," not that kind of thing any woman will make a fuss about. Who has the time?
I've been to a number of panels on sexual harassment in the media and what to do about it, recently. The question of "the line" comes up again and again. Is it harassment if a man touches your arm? The implication was that this kind of complaint goes too far.
This behavior is called grooming. He is testing his victims. He's making them question their own sense of boundaries. As he advances, they blame themselves -- why didn't I do anything about the arm? Did I send the wrong message? It sets him for a defense if he's ever confronted
The perpetrator here would put his hand on a female colleague's back, her knee, her arm...he'd ask her inappropriate, but not damning personal questions.

The old frame doesn‚Äôt work. I believe our job is to give honest and fair information and analysis to our audience. But I‚Äôm not going to do human origami trying to get into an old box.
But I‚Äôve let go of that notion of journalism and of my role in it. Not everything in politics can be explained as the outcome of a reasoned choice motivated  by what is best for the public or even core political supporters.
I get it. My first job in journalism was as a business reporter covering bankruptcy for the Dow Jones Newswires. I spent quite a few years as an editor at Politico.
This moment (the last 48 hours and the meta ‚Äúmoment‚Äù) is hard on journalists, particularly those who‚Äôve spent their careers covering politics from arms length, attempting to assess and explain stories free from the substantive merits of policy.

@HeliotropicGirl Oops. He's the reporter who did the reporting I'm referencing.
7. If the best defense that the aides closest to Trump can come up with for his open support for Putin as Putin stood their and lied is that he's delusional, they must either be delusional themselves or believe that we are delusional enough to buy it.
6. As far as his belief this is a "witch hunt," why did he personally dictate the cover-up statement about the Trump Tower meeting? https://t.co/HOnnxjzbvR
5. Meanwhile, when he talks about "collusion" he says that there was nothing going on between Russia and the campaign. For example, today he said: https://t.co/ZPagPHOQRI
4. He's described "collusion" and "cyberattack" with the correct words along the way. IE: A four-hundred-pound man probably broke into the DNC or maybe the Chinese. He gets the idea.
3. For example: The claim that "Trump is constitutionally incapable of taking anything Mueller finds seriously" doesn't match up with his commitment to kill the Russia investigation (pre and post Mueller). He fired his FBI director and considered ousting Sessions.
2. Clearly, Trump isn't just confused about all of this, based on his own public statements.

@TauhidChappell I‚Äôm curious if he (or his surrogates) have fanned out to ask women to write these things.
The next step in the #MeToo movement is to enshrine change. I believe that will require significant  legal changes and fierce government enforcementof them. Does Kavanaugh think that is a role the government can or should play?
Let‚Äôs not be fooled by the sleight of hand. Whatever Kavanaugh is like as a dad, husband or boss, his job will be to decide what legal protections women get to enjoy. He appears comfortable striking down Roe. He‚Äôs deeply skeptical of government regulation of business.
But while horrible conduct toward women should be a strike against a man under consideration for a powerful position, even, perhaps disqualifying, basic human decency is not a substitute for a judicial record that protects women‚Äôs rights.
It sounds like he‚Äôs a decent person based on these testimonies. If we were hearing the opposite, I‚Äôd be deeply concerned. Integrity matters whe your job is Supreme Court Justice, in particular.
At this point there‚Äôs a clear Kavanaugh is ‚Äúgood for women‚Äù theme emerging.  Monday night he mentioned his wife, daughters and female coworkers. His female carpool friend came to his defense in the Post. Now Chua is calling him a mentor in the WSJ.

But, for fucksake, leaders are supposed to be on OUR team. You are supposed to care about the public, about the law, about upholding our values. Take care of the little guy/gal. Don't call them liars to protect your own sense of entitlement.
To extend the locker room metaphor further, the powerful are thinking about teams. Whose team are they on? Are Republicans on Team Republican, ready to circle the wagons around their buddies no matter what? That's what Trump did for Jordan this week.
But Democrats are also grappling with whether they should have a zero-tolerance policy, themselves. https://t.co/39qEiGnIny
Republicans are certainly in a unique bind on questions of sexual abuse and harassment. They can't exactly say, "credible claims of abuse mean you should step down from office," when Trump is sitting in the White House.
Leadership isn't supposed to be about what you are entitled to do (or in Jordan's case not do). It's about taking responsibility.
Trump was talking about "locker room" in metaphor after the Access Hollywood tape. Jordan was in a literal locker room. But the concept seemed the same. There are certain zones -- metaphorical or literal -- where their definition of masculinity shields them from responsibility.
I found it eerie how much Jim Jordan sounded like Trump last night on Fox. He suggested maybe wrestlers did mention the team doctor was molesting them, but it was just "talk in a locker room." https://t.co/4MzqbZj53p

In #MeToo stories, we hear again and again about victims who did speak up, but faced retaliation, abuse, etc. not being believed is terrible. But so often it seems victims are believed. People with power just don‚Äôt think enough of them to care.
It‚Äôs not that he actually doesn‚Äôt believe them. He just doesn‚Äôt care.

@OConnellPostbiz Women, meanwhile, are shutout. One reason is women are less likely to engage on the platform as prolifically as men over fear of harassment, threats of violence (sexual or otherwise) and other routine attacks. (hellscape)
@OConnellPostbiz The subhead sets up a discussion of findings in the study that show Twitter boosts professional legitimacy for male political reporters, who tweet amongst themselves 92% of the time (fun).
@MarcBodnick @maggieNYT @JRubinBlogger @ananavarro I don't know if Jennifer Rubin is credentialed. If she is, she is in the study,  but she is not followed by as many DC journalists as the journalists on the top 25 list.
@MarcBodnick @maggieNYT @JRubinBlogger @ananavarro The study includes reporters in D.C.with Congressional credentials.  Maggie is NYC, not DC. Anna Navarro is a GOP strategist and commentator, not a reporter.
@adi The mansplain fear seems to loom large.  Why is that so particularly bad? Does it start a pile on? Lots of worse stuff is said all the time on Twitter, so just curious why a few men have mentioned this.
@cheesetrader1 @maggieNYT The cohort in the study is reporters credentialed by the Congressional press galleries. Reporters outside of the DC area were not included. (You can't get a credential if you don't live here.)
@adi The content of the tweets is a good question. The authors didn't explore what was said, just the number of interactions. And to your point about men's concerns about how they come across, I've heard that not wanting to look "flirty" is a piece of the reluctance, too.
@jpwest @GingerGibson I wonder how many women are on lists versus men. It could make the follow numbers better or worse. Hard to know.

Lots of questions about @maggieNYT. @nikkiusher can explain the methodology better, but as I understand it, the idea was to study a defined cohort of peers. Also, of the 25 most-replied-to reporters, ZERO were women. Maggie would bring that stat up to ONE out of 25. https://t.co/mMnki6mKmX

At the same time, we're in the middle of a culture and political awakening, driven by #MeToo, which itself is an online phenomenon. What does it mean that men are dominating the conversation? Is an arguably successful movement actually stunted and we don't even know it?
Women are locked out. It's bad for our careers. And it's bad for news. We need more voices shaping what stories are important and how to think about them.
Twitter, in general, isn't a real place. But in Washington media, it actually matters. It's where conventional wisdom gels, where bookers look for talking heads to put on TV, where journalists build up legitimacy and exposure in the news industry.
Women also RT men more frequently. I'd like to check out my own stats to see whether I'm just as much a part of the problem.
Male journos also retweet other dudes three times as often as female peers.
New study finds my guess about male journo Twitter is way worse than I thought. When a male journo tweets at another reporter, 92% of the time it's to a man.  https://t.co/vx9hBmU4r8

@AbrasiveObelisk I can‚Äôt quantify the size, but the group that‚Äôs using the ambition language is loud. They‚Äôre being quoted in the media. They‚Äôre already organized on social media. The louder voice can matter even if it‚Äôs a smaller chorus.
@CKentDP Yep. The party hasn‚Äôt embraced the clean-house idea. Some liberals want to. But others don‚Äôt. Uncle Bill is even out there running around defending Franken.

This is the idea at the heart of the conflict. It doesn‚Äôt mean that everyone who supports it also questions women‚Äôs‚Äô ambitions. This tweet doesn‚Äôt go there. But a lot of liberals do. https://t.co/ZvLDG6Lkko
@johnlk1980 @Deirdre926 @KamalaHarris @ninaturner The issue is whether an old attitude about ambition is shaping how Democrats are setting up or damaging women in their party. There‚Äôs a direct line between the priorities of the women-led resistance and this attitude.
@p_jeanne97 @Mhuynh9 That‚Äôs not the dominant criticism.
@johnlk1980 @KamalaHarris @ninaturner The point is that she‚Äôs being attacked for her motives and ambitions, not, say, her actual work, good or bad.
@NathanWurtzel That‚Äôs true re: Boehner. I‚Äôm talking about liberals who are frustrated that Trump is in the White House despite the Access Hollywood tape and dozens of accusations around him.
@elongreen Maybe I‚Äôm responding to the wrong question! There‚Äôs the Franken debate, then there are larger question about how one group wants to take on Trump. That faction‚Äôs language is sliding into attacks on the ambitions of several female Ds.
@elongreen The Left talks about Nina Turner the same way some more-establishment women talk about Kirsten Gillibrand. This doesn‚Äôt cut cleanly across gender, ideology, etc.
@SteveJGardner I don‚Äôt mean to sound like I don‚Äôt think we should weigh a politician‚Äôs decision, like you‚Äôre saying here. Necessary to do! The question I want to explore is whether liberals are heading into double-standard territory around ambition.
@JudyBPaints My point is bigger than Gillibrand. The same criticism is creeping into conversations about other women, too. On Klobuchar: I do wish I‚Äôd taken a closer look at where she stands. I will. It‚Äôs a good question I should have considered.
@Mhuynh9 That would be a fair observation. Nut assessing political positioning in context is different than what‚Äôs going on here.
@Deirdre926 @KamalaHarris @ninaturner I‚Äôm pointing out that the criticism is the same. The fact each of these women is so different underscores the point. The criticism is lodged at all kinds of women in power.

Regardless of whether this is conscious, this kind of language has consequences for female candidates. If liberals keep it up, they could bruise their entire 2020 crop of possible female candidates.
Meanwhile, the same claims are creeping into the conversation around other rising star Democrats like @KamalaHarris and @ninaturner. Can‚Äôt trust their motives, either.
But a vocal faction is aggressively questioning her motives. She‚Äôs out for herself not the party. The ‚Äúambition‚Äù line is the same attack many women running for office face. It ran through the 2016 campaign.
.@SenGillibrand has become the focal point of the conflict. She led the charge against him. For some liberals, it ends there. They disagree with her.
The conflict is spilling out into the open over the Franken resignation controversy. Republicans wouldn‚Äôt have knifed one of their own over the same accusations. (The argument goes)

When will leaders in our industry hold us to the same standard? I hope soon.
The media is leading the charge on outing powerful perpetrators of sexual harassment and sexual violence, keeping the issue front and center and demanding other industry face the music.
.@annamerlan published an account yesterday of my experience writing about sexual misconduct by a powerful man in media, Glenn Thrush, and how the NYT's, where he works, handled it. I sat for an interview because I think it's time for the news industry to take a look at itself.
It's also horrible for the news industry. What message does it send when a national newsroom says: If you accuse a man at the top, even if there's visual evidence and even if he doesn't deny it, you will be the one on trial -- literally in court out thousands of $$.
This is a horrible situation for Hilary. She was treated badly.
I have no inside information here, just what I'm reading about in the press. Based on that, it looks to me like the Globe decided to go after the accuser, rather than launch a neutral investigation into their editor-in-chief.
And it turns out that the Globe was just attacking her for the hell of it.  Yesterday, the Globe said "legal action is no longer necessary," because they now have enough information.
Let's say that's true. Why is it OK for the editor of a major publication to turn what was clearly a professional exchange into a creepy, harassing one? This is an exchange about their work. https://t.co/QmHmfr84qy
The Globe claims it was "likely" that this exchange happened after she was an employee.
The accused, Globe Editor-in-Chief Brian McGrory, doesn't deny that he sent it. He just can't remember the conversation. Which, OK...
Let's review: The Boston Globe sued a former Globe writer, Hilary Sargent, who accused the editor-in-chief of sending her a gross text message. She posted screenshots on Twitter. https://t.co/5IeYq0pR7A
The media is doing groundbreaking work to tackle the long-ignored story of sexual harassment. We‚Äôd never write off or attack a source because the accused friends say she‚Äôs a slut. Let‚Äôs do the work in our own house.
I‚Äôm a person with a decent amount of power. I‚Äôve got an employer standing by me. I‚Äôve got a credible resume in journalism. And still, my sex life, real or imagined, was used against me.
I decided to speak about this because there are still big unanswered questions about how to handle #metoo cases. Let‚Äôs not kid ourselves about how far we‚Äôve actually come.
I hired a lawyer to send the NYT a cease and desist letter. Their investigation ended the next day. (I don‚Äôt know if the timing was related or not.)
I hired lawyer, ultimately, who sent the NYT a cease a desist letter.
The big surprise for me was that a crew of NYT rushed in to help him out. Here‚Äôs a summary from a source who spoke to @annamerlan: https://t.co/7qwOr5j3VZ
We didn‚Äôt hesitate. This was the POINT of the story. Thrush behaves badly and then tries to cover it up by by smearing the woman.
I published the story despite a lawyer (hired by Thrush) urging my employer to look into my personal relationships. We interpreted the pre-publication letter a threat. https://t.co/rTQwdZkTkH

The refrain that Franken (and others) were denied "due process" is understandable. No one wants to exile a person over baseless accusations.
The larger point I want to make about Franken is that we (the collective we) have not come to a consensus on what to do about men who are credibly accused of sexual harassment, assault or other misconduct. It's a big unanswered question of #MeToo
A man emailed me pointing out that he admired his mother and he has three daughters.
A woman emailed me, too, (self-described liberal + feminist), arguing what happened to Franken was "a lynching"  over  "stupid, childish behavior."

My understanding from Posties is that Tracy Grant is well respected in the newsroom. So maybe she did set aside her own feelings. The problem is that now there‚Äôs a precedent for who is allowed to run these types of investigations. Grant is respected. Not everyone is.
But the @washingtonpost is trying to have it both ways here. To ask staff and readers to accept the outcome with details, there‚Äôs an expectation that the investigation was independent. Instead, they put an old friend in charge.
There are valid reasons not to detail his behavior. The women haven‚Äôt had to deal with public scrutiny (luckily).
We know that @JoelAchenbach apologized to multiple women for inappropriate behavior, but the @washingtonpost won‚Äôt say beyond that what it was.
She said during the two-and-a-half month investigation she lost sleep some nights. When they decided to suspend him for 90 days (not let him go) she slept like a baby.
I just asked @washingtonpost ME Tracy Grant about the @JoelAchenbach investigation. She ran the investigation, which seems, perhaps, unorthodox given she said they‚Äôve known each other for 30 years.

Until powerful industry figures like Diller and powerful cultural critics like Dowd put themselves on the line, real change is going to remain elusive.
Diller and Dowd actually matter here. Diller has real power to change industry practices. Dowd has the platform to continue uncomfortable conversations. Neither of them seems to even believe the extent of the problem in front of them. Or, if they do, they just don't care.
The New York Times reported this week (in its news pages) that change in workplaces have been elusive even amid all of press coverage around sexual harassment.
Dowd volunteers she thinks the movie industry's been stunted, putting the onus instead on...porn: "Once, Hollywood taught us about desire and sex and romance, giving us a vocabulary for these experiences. But no more."
Diller says we're done with this whole thing anyway: ‚ÄúOther than psychopaths, I think all of this bad behavior is finished." Dowd's response? If she pushed him on that, it's not in the text.
She interviewed Barry Diller this week and let's Diller get away with equating CBS  firing Charlie Rose to the death penalty. "Are we really going to have only capital punishment? Because right now, that‚Äôs what we have."
Maureen Dowd smeared Monica Lewinsky. Now she's undermining the  cultural reckoning around sexual harassment and assault. https://t.co/lPcvuUMIwn

The big question about #metoo is what happens next? How do we get policies in place to make workplaces safe for everyone? If we're looking at Congress to do it, they've got a long way to go themselves.
Congress is grappling with a reckoning around sexual harassment in their own house. They admit their harassment complaint system is opaque and onerous. Interns aren't even allowed to use it, in any case. Then they're asked to sign an intimidating document.
Employment lawyers were shocked that interns don't get a copy of these. When Rachel called offices looking for a copy, almost none wanted to go on the record or provide a copy of what they ask interns to sign. There's no centralized place where these documents live.
Employment lawyers Rachel spoke to were stunned that there is no explicit exception made for harassment.

The argument boils down to: maybe women shouldn‚Äôt engage in public life. If you just stay home, this wouldn‚Äôt happen.
But that doesn‚Äôt mean women who want to participate in government should be prepared for and expect public shaming on the basis of gender.
But the job of the media isn‚Äôt to treat people the way bad actors treat them. We are supposed to apply standards, not adopt the worst of others.

Until we reach an agreement, we‚Äôll loose sight of the institutions, powerful actors and community pressures that let abuse along the spectrum of sexual misconduct thrive. The whole exercise of shining a light requires then changing the system. Otherwise this is all pointless.
Until we reach an agreement on our standard‚Äîzero tolerance or varying punishment‚Äîthe debate is inevitably going to wander into finger pointing and cries about hypocrisy.
We‚Äôre in a moment when some industries are saying that it‚Äôs not automatically a fireable offense. Punishment shouldn‚Äôt always go that far. Essentially, sometimes harassment is OK, as long as the accused promises to stop and take his lesser lumps.
As my colleague @kainazamaria put it recently, is some amount of sexual harassment acceptable? Should we say there‚Äôs zero tolerance for this behavior? Or is there some amount we are willing to accept?
The underlying issue is that we have to decide what our standards should be. With Nassar, there‚Äôs no question that he should have the book thrown at him. But in cases of sexual harassment, even when criminal misconduct is alleged or established, we have not decided our standard.
We‚Äôre having a debate about whether it‚Äôs fair to hold one powerful person to account when another institution did nearly the same thing. It‚Äôs fair to see the hypocrisy, or, more generously, the irony.
It should not require a victim to crusade ‚Äî-at great personal cost ‚Äîto take on a predator AND a system stacked against her. Rachel Denhollder, who took on Nassar, describes it well here: https://t.co/XwX7piXDNz https://t.co/P3Uc26ST5R

I just think it‚Äôs important to remember that women weren‚Äôt acting irrationally for years. It makes sense.
Even now, it‚Äôs groups of women taking down men, not individuals.
There was no appetite in the press.  Rampant culture of retaliation. At best, a payoff and NDA. Not great for your career.
When I see regrets from women who wish they spoke up sooner, there were perfectly logical reasons not to.
Research shows 75% of victims who speak up report retaliation.
Maybe twitter isn‚Äôt the right place to explore this. But women spoke up for years. The problem was the response.

As we‚Äôre grappling with ‚Äúbreaking the silence,‚Äù I‚Äôd like to think of more ways to force the powerful to change the culture.
Instead of looking down, maybe there‚Äôs someone above Weinstein or at least in his vicinity who we could consider first for legal action? https://t.co/MkGTaBoP6b
Going to also throw this out there: maybe Weinstein enjoyed the power trip of forcing one woman to entrap another. Who knows.
To break it down further, the premise of the assistant‚Äôs job is discretion. They even sign agreements.

In Puerto Rico, challenging news reports describing lives on the brink is not a game. (11)
It feels like a bit of a political game here in Washington when @realDonaldTrump lashes out at the media, calls it fake news. (10)
Credible reporters and outlets are  describing life and death in PR.  The govt says not to believe it. (9)
But they very clearly show two narratives totally at odds. The govt. v. widespread testimony and  images (8)
They can't read minds and point to secret motives. (7)
They tallied up dozens of deaths credibly reported as hurricane related and hundreds of unexplained deaths. (6)
.@AlexiaCampbell and @elizabarclay were disturbed by conflicting descriptions from the ground and the govt. (5)
There's also an important democratic question: If the govt doesn't acknowledge the death of your loved ones, what trust is there?  (4)
But experts tell @voxdotcom that the method adopted by the govt to count is so conservative it is sure to under count. (2)
It's difficult to get a handle on this number in a major crisis like PR. (2)
The death toll is a critical factor in assessing the extent of a disaster. It drives the resources govt commits, media coverage. (1)
Local officials and funeral directors have confirmed more hurricane deaths than Trump and the PR govt cite https://t.co/naoMptSiZH

I need a Twitter/email/life copy editor.
@vosdscott Absolutely.
@vosdscott Current power dynamics in workplaces create poor incentives for the powerful on so many fronts.
@vosdscott But to your point about generation, I agree. I don't want this convo to end assuming men have evolved and all is well.
@vosdscott Ironically, not mentioned in my thread, is that I covered Bob Filner as my first job in DC. I can talk more on that some other time.
But I'm also in senior position. I do not want to assume the culture I experience is the same for everyone.
I feel I should also say something about my current employer @voxmediainc. My years here have been harassment-free.
Conversations need to start wherever possible. So I'm not shaming private words. I think it just speaks to the point I'm trying to make.
I want to say I'm delighted some men have DMed me in agreement. But I appreciate the public @s from male industry colleagues even more.
@vosdscott One thing I've wondered is if there's an industry that actually gets this right. Is there a model out there?
@vosdscott That's a whole other thread!
I just wonder if they're willing to speak up. (38)
We need real accountability and real change. I believe there are powerful figures in journalism who agree. (37)
I'm not talking about a committee shunted to the side filled with editors without real power. (36)
How would we build a system that incentives what we want from powerful people? (35)
But now it's on leaders to look at the entrenched system around us that lets this behavior flourish. (34)
One person breaking through by speaking is important. It is noble. It is brave. It is necessary. (33)
An industry built on speech, expression and truth isn't creating the same system inside its own walls. (32)
They know the same things Weinstein, Ailes, Cosby and the rest knew all along. (34)
They know their name, connections and reputation opens doors. (33)
They know journalism is a meritocracy, until its not. (32)
Men with power who want to abuse it know the culture, too. (31)
And if I know this, women above me know this enough this and women below do, too, what do our powerful male colleagues know? (30)
So what about other women down the line? Why on Earth should we expect them to "break the culture of silence"? What does that get them? (29)
I had some stature, a title, genuine respect from superiors. But the responses confirmed why I was reluctant to speak. (28)
She laughed and said that said colleague was just "joking." I didn't find it funny. (27)
As I write this, I'm recalling more incidents, including complaining to an editor about a creepy email a colleague sent. (26)
In all these situations, I myself was a fairly senior person. I felt I had standing to raise my concerns. 	 (25)
In that instance, I appealed my case to the COO (a woman) who saw this as both a problem for me AND the company. (24)
He was baffled. Parking attendant always seemed like a good guy to him. (23)
Editor #3 (a man): I complained that the parking attendant exposed himself to me in the garage. I asked for a new space (22)
She went on: I do not talk about a boyfriend. I make jokes about politics. I should not be surprised where this all ends.	 (21)
Editor #2 told me, in a full earnest reaction, that I needed to take a hard look at myself. I seem too available. (20)
Editor #1 told me to be careful not to reject this reporter like I would just any man. (19)
Two of the senior editors -- both women -- saw my complaint as a moment to teach me about the way of the world in journalism. (18)
Three times in my career I've complained to editors about a colleague inappropriately touching me. (17)
When this is the backdrop in so many newsrooms, where does it lead besides a culture of silence? (16)
All women know, in particular, no one likes a woman who complains. (15)
Anyone whose been to high school knows it is not cool to complain you are not in the cool club. (14)
Those subtle messages also speak to out groups (women, POC) who see they are not in the club. (13)
Over time, those small gestures add up. Opportunity, connections, positive praise matter in a career. (12)
There are the soft discrimination moments. Male editor sees himself in young white man. Gives him sources. Takes him golfing. (11)
And that standard starts right inside our own house. What behaviors and standards have we collectively ignored? (10)
In our editorial work on behalf of public, I think we need to rethink our standard. (9)
I think about my responsibilities. Is it incumbent on a less powerful person to break a huge norm to make me look hard? (8)
But by requiring that standard -- for the less powerful to have to stand up to the powerful -- to tell a story feels wrong to me. (7)
It is certainly the bravery of several women this week who challenged that culture this week and broke it open. (6)
We in the media are clinging to the idea that it was a culture of silence in Hollywood that stopped us from telling this story. (5)
It's time for some soul searching. (4)
Why is that media didn't collectively see a story of sexual harassment in a competitive, creative field as a story? (3)
Kim Masters at the Hollywood Reporter pushed for years. But where were the other editorial leaders? (2)
The Weinstein "open secret" storyline creates a moment for media to ask ourselves some tough questions. (1)

One more thing: Women, if you fall just a little short of years experience for a job, apply! Make your case. Your male counterparts are.
Overall, my main message is that I talk to a lot of people for a lot of jobs. Make it easy on me to remember you.
Keep your linkedin updated. I'll google you.
Do not followup an email with a call. You're putting me on the spot. I don't appreciate it. I'll get back to you when I can.
Honestly, sorry to say it, but if you take forever (week+) on something that I ask for -- sample, followup, etc, I will read into slowness.
If something comes to you after the fact: "I wish I'd say X in my interview!" Email me X! When I give you my email, I'm serious. Feel free.
If your resume spills onto another page, that's fine. As long as it's easy to read and relevant, I don't really care about rules like that.
If you are submitting a sample or a test, please include the instructions! Name the file what it is. I'm looking across all departments.
If you've applied for a job here before, mention it! It's really really a positive thing.
If you don't get a job on your first try, apply again! Maybe it just wasn't the perfect fit. I've hired multiple people on round 2 or 3!
No one likes to answer the salary requirement question. But seriously, just tell me. I will need to make a budget ask.
Why do you want to leave your current job? Just be honest. I'm looking for a story that makes sense.
I'm not thaat interested in who you're friends with in the newsroom. I want to know about your work.
Look at the homepage the day of your interview.
If you get the same question from two different editors, it's OK to give the same answer! Just make it good!
In an interview, repeat your key resume details you want me to know. Don't let me mix you up with another applicant.
Show off that you actually read and like @voxdotcom (or wherever you are applying). And why! Specifically!
Cold emails are OK. But please be specific about what you're looking for.
If you email about a coffee/followup/anything, attach your resume. But still apply in the system. It's how I can find you later.
Repetition is fine. Put relevant info about your past experience EVERYWHERE -- cover letter, pitch memo, resume.
Feel free to add a note to a clip on why you like it.
Don't send weird file formats.
Make sure your links work.
Some annoying thoughts on job applications: Please put your full name at the top of all materials/save files with your full name.
