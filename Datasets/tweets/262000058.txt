@realDonaldTrump Can‚Äôt wait until you are tweeting from Siberia in exile you worthless, lying coward. You have small hands and an even smaller brain...
@SenKamalaHarris Excellent job questioning this trojan horse of a nominee. Would love to watch you question Trump :)
@AndrewGillum @realDonaldTrump These corrupt, spineless GOP cowards are running scared hoping man-baby Trump will come to their rescue. Sad! 	Keep on keeping on Andrew Gillum!
@PassTheSalty Freaking love Kamala! Would love to see her interrogate Dotard Trump
@realDonaldTrump You really are clueless and deranged. The walls are closing in on you and your corrupt family and administration. Do us all a favor and go to Russia and live the rest of your life in shameful exile.

@RyanAFournier What the country needs is a real president with integrity, empathy, intellect and courage.  Trump is a one-term disaster that will leave the office in a cloud of shame, indictments and severe reckoning for the spineless GOP. Get ready for another 8+ years of Democratic dominance.
