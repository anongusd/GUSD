I'm never changing his mind but how he thinks is how too many view powerful women. We need to examine why we feel threatened by a woman a charge. As Nancy Pelosi recently said, “It’s like you’re a tree, and they’re peeling the bark right off you. You have to be prepared for it.”
Him: Well, a hundred women in Congress is way more than enough.		Me: We’re half the population and deserve equal representation.		Him: Not sure about that.		Me, smiling: Have a great weekend!		Him: You too. Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do!		Me: That limits nothing!		We laugh.
Guy who I talk to at the local coffee shop every day: They better not make that b*tch Nancy Pelosi speaker.		Me, ignoring his degrading remark: Who would you prefer?		Him: I dunno.		Me: Do you have any idea how hard that job is? Driving consensus among 100s	to pass a bill?
The next Congress will be the most diverse in history w/ 100+ women serving in the House. I’m proud to work for one of those trailblazing members!

This isn’t about us v. them. It’s about providing all people with the same level of opportunity and asking if the standards that we apply to one human‘s action apply to all. It’s really basic and we must get there.
There are every day actions we can take to resist societal impulses toward “himpathy” and minimizing women. It takes work and awareness since women have been conditioned to compete with each other, shrink ourselves, and cater to the male ego for our entire lives.
