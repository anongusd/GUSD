@SenSanders You obviously didn't listen when @RandPaul schooled you in what a "right" is.		https://t.co/RETgZQjiHd
@SenSanders But you want to install a Socialist government that has done nothing but bring death and destruction to every country that had adopted it. Yeah I'll choose a shut down in a capitalist society any day #watchtheworldbern	#FeelTheBern 	#SocialismKills 	#BernieSanders
