RT @arneduncan: Thanks everyone for making this a great #ptchat! More information on our Framework can be found here --&gt; http://t.co/CC4C0E…
A8: School leaders should remove barriers to family engagement. When parents are welcomed as partners they will exceed expectations. #ptchat
@arneduncan Yes, but note that @dcpublicschools home visits focus on parents' hopes &amp; dreams for their kids, not just assessments. #ptchat
@tejana_made Agreed, but having a good relationships in place allows for early &amp; effective interventions - a big time saver in the long run!
A7: Parenting is often a shared responsibility. Engage Auntie and Grandpa in the conversation.  Kids need a lot of support! #ptchat
A7: Daily interactions are important. There's no reason to wait for the report card to share progress and challenges!  #ptchat
A6: The framework can provide important platforms for bridging parents and schools. Invest in teachers/principals to make this work. #ptchat
A6: It is important that teachers &amp; principals possess the skills &amp; community/cultural competencies to engage parents as partners.  #ptchat
@PTAThornton  I had an opp'ty to speak w/ you during your visit to Detroit.  Any chance you can come to the DADS event scheduled in June?
A5: Helping parents understand their kids' rights &amp; how to navigate the system to get support is important. So is making this EASY. #ptchat
A5: Raising a kid is HARD...  Raising one with special needs is REALLY HARD!  It's important that these families get SUPPORT!  #ptchat
Hear hear! RT @iedifyminds A4. For parents to be advocates they must believe in the power of their voice and schools must respect it #ptchat
A4: A network of parents can band together to be advocates for ALL kids in their school/community. It really does take a village! #ptchat
A4: Parents play a huge role in ensuring learning &amp; behavior is reinforced at home. They help kids develop great learning habits! #ptchat
A4: Parents are the experts on their own children. By sharing their insights with teachers, they can be a tremendous advocate.  #ptchat
A2: When parents feel welcomed &amp; recognized as the experts of their own individual children, schools will reap the benefits. #ptchat
A2: Supts et al should help invest in school leaders &amp; teachers to take down barriers to parent involvement. They are great assets! #ptchat
A1: Parents (broadly defined) are kids' first and most influential teachers. When we invest in parents, we set up kids for success! #ptchat
A1: Experiences in homes, schools, and communities shape the way kids think/behave. All settings should promote healthy development! #ptchat
