@meliral @meliral but you make a point and this could be talked into circles endlessly if you and I wanted to waste more time on it
@meliral I wasn't the one raising the issue the bot went off on. I'm stating that the bot isn't going to change anyone's mind like that.
@meliral my point is it's not even remotely productive and the only purpose it serves is to make one feel good about oneself.
@meliral if the bot creator thinks conservative ideas are so toxic, why not try and win with your own ideas instead of tweet shaming.
@meliral you can yell all day about how something is bad and feel great about yourself for doing it, but what good does that do?
@meliral if you strongly believe something is unacceptable, don't you have a moral obligation to at least try?
So the goal of your statement isn't to change those people's opinions, just to yell at them? Then what's the point of it? https://t.co/mgnZ4idnmA
