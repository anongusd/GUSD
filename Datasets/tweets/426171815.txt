@scorpio_19_12 @KMOV Our D.C. interview was focused on a number of topics - including the government shutdown at the time. There are times I wish we could air entire interviews with elected officials, but our on air format often requires us to boil down the most important topics of the day.
@scorpio_19_12 @KMOV Thanks for the feedback. The story was actually reported by Kenneth Craig in Washington D.C. Our producer placed the story at 6 covering today's events at CPAC. The story also included information about Bernie Sanders rally.

@WSMVLindsay @KMOV Hello there!
In Nashville where one woman told me the state bird should be the crane. They are everywhere.  Tonight on News 4 at 6 we’re talking to leaders in this community about their unified government. Did that contribute? Or is it the country music fueling their success? @kmov https://t.co/Co4XIIBmZ5

@randyjohnston @alexiszotos Randy, fair points. It's still important to ask how the unified government structure impacts their efforts to grow. I'll never forget seeing them on the HQ2 Top 20 list while our region was noticeably absent. No question STL has assets others would love to have - how do we grow?
@randyjohnston @alexiszotos Randy, I definitely noticed some new development downtown, especially the areas next to downtown. You are correct, they don't have light rail. They cite a unified government as a way to sell Indianapolis to outsiders. The St. Louis metro is larger, and has more Fortune 500 corps.
“We’re going on 50 years of this experiment, and in many ways it put Indianapolis on the map.”  Today I spoke with Indianapolis officials about their city/county merger. I’ll explain how it worked, and why it’s still a work in progress News 4 at 6 pm. @kmov. https://t.co/vTcddtbkUS

@AviationStl @JasonHallSTL @chris_stritzel I always tell people St. Louis has tons of areas other cities would envy. Imagine if Soulard, CWE, Clayton, Old North, and downtown were all connected.
@AviationStl @JasonHallSTL @chris_stritzel I’m not a city planner, but my gut tells me the intersection of North 6th and Locust could be the catalyst that drives us forward. It’s near metrolink and could be very dense. It would start to bridge some gaps.  We need to think big at that corner.
@AviationStl @JasonHallSTL @chris_stritzel Honestly I think that’s been a key to KC success. Tourists can focus on a dense corridor.  Overall STL offers a ton if you know where to find it. We need a connecting corridor between Wash Ave, the Landing, Arch and Ballpark Village.
@JasonHallSTL @chris_stritzel @GatewayArchSTL @cityfoundrystl @CortexSTL @OneHundredSTL @OneCardinalWay I also noticed high end chains like Bristol. I realize people can be adverse to chains, but it's evidence of success.
@JasonHallSTL @chris_stritzel @GatewayArchSTL @cityfoundrystl @CortexSTL @OneHundredSTL @OneCardinalWay .@JasonHallSTL what do you forsee? A few things I noticed in KC on Monday. Music pumped from restaurants to the public sidewalk. Lots of lighting and interesting signage. Outdoor firepits, nice landscaping, EXTREMELY clean streets.
@chris_stritzel @JasonHallSTL @GatewayArchSTL @cityfoundrystl @CortexSTL @OneHundredSTL @OneCardinalWay No question Railway Exchange needs rehab. It would change Olive. I'm still hoping for an announcement from @Square soon. Jefferson Arms and Chemical would add density. An improved convention complex will help.
@chris_stritzel @JasonHallSTL @GatewayArchSTL @cityfoundrystl @CortexSTL @OneHundredSTL @OneCardinalWay With good leadership downtown could be drastically improved within a decade. I saw it happen in Kansas City.
@chris_stritzel @JasonHallSTL @GatewayArchSTL I'm encouraged by @cityfoundrystl, @CortexSTL @OneHundredSTL and other projects in the city. If @OneCardinalWay leases quickly I'm convinced TWO Cardinal Way will follow. Also wonder if other businesses will want to build after seeing what's coming.
@chris_stritzel @JasonHallSTL When I moved to KC in 2005 downtown was empty. Power &amp; Light changed it. Phase 2 of Ballpark Village reminds me of P &amp; L. #STL is fortunate because @GatewayArchSTL is a guaranteed draw. KC's core is booming, but it's not necessarily office driven.

@CitySceneSTL @cityscenekc In that location I’m convinced there will be future announcements. Hoping to see downtown momentum continue.  I was in KC on Monday.  The amount of change over the last decade is incredible.
@CitySceneSTL @cityscenekc What did we lose?

@JohnWSheehan @JasonHallSTL I’ve also lived in both and agree. That said, still believe metrolink is a stronger asset. It connects people for miles and travels through the central core. The streetcar covers a dense area but the route is relatively short.
@bobmayhall Send me an email with the information. Chris.nagus@kmov.com.  I’m happy to have a discussion about the circumstances.
@countondowntown @AviationStl @flystl @AerLingus Still convinced you could fill a plane, especially if it's on a seasonal basis. Prior to WOW demand to Iceland was virtually zero. Imagine Ireland. People would go. I still think @Icelandair should consider filling the WOW void.
@AviationStl @flystl They are doing MSP in 2019, and they are barely in the range. I'm told the dark green around St. Louis shows an area with a strong Irish heritage. I have no doubt @AerLingus would be supported in #STL. It seems a seasonal route would be a great way to enter the market.
And finally: "And no government employees ever participated in campaign or political activities."
The statement goes on to say: "These allegations are totally meritless and nothing more than a partisan attempt to slander the work of the Attorney General's Office. As we have said before, no taxpayer resources were ever expended for campaign purposes."
The letter sent by @JayAshcroftMO to American Democracy Legal Fund regarding the investigation into @AGJoshHawley.

Just got off the phone with @JayAshcroftMO deputy general counsel. The office is investigating whether @AGJoshHawley used public funds as Attorney General to support his candidacy for US Senate. Still waiting for a response from Hawley's office. @kmov
@downtownstlouis @KelleyStl68 What is the vision for 2030? More retail? More residential? More business? Curious to hear more about the vision.
@JustinMeyerKC @airportscouncil Thanks, that's what I was guessing since I noticed darker shades around Chicago and Boston as well.
@JustinMeyerKC @airportscouncil What do the different green shades over Missouri represent? I notice the darker green over the eastern part of the state vs the lighter shade elsewhere. Curious what that means.

@AviationStl @JustinMeyerKC @flystl I see it as overall demand for air travel in a given market. Mid America passengers are definitely from the St. Louis market. I know people who drive from West County to fly Allegiant - who would otherwise catch those flights at Lambert.
@JustinMeyerKC @flystl Got it thanks. Mid America has actually been growing quite a bit with expanded service and destinations on Allegiant.  In a region with two commercial airports those numbers can be spread out.
@JustinMeyerKC Does this factor in Numbers from Belleville Mid America airport? Quite a few people fly Allegiant and almost all of it’s local O &amp; D traffic that wouldn’t be counted @flystl.

@lichbitz @alexiszotos @amazon @LydaKrewson @SteveStenger @mikeparson It's a good question, and a fair question. I don't know the ROI, but no question announcements like this lead to other benefits.

@GentryTrotter @alexiszotos @amazon @LydaKrewson @SteveStenger @mikeparson I have no doubt St. Louis can compete. We have the talent, infrastructure, and resources. I've always believed our region is underestimated. Yes, we need to convince outsiders, but we also need to convince locals. Imagine if #STL pride was a shared among all 2.8 million of us.
@asraza It is concerning, however it is also encouraging to see an investment coming to the convention complex. Hopefully it will attract new conventions. That said, it's hard to see this one go.

@danieljfogarty @amazon All fair points. I don't think chasing a single headquarters is the solution. Perhaps it's a marathon, not a sprint. There's nothing better than reporting on local corporations adding #STL jobs. I just wish we had more of those headlines - especially downtown.
@danieljfogarty @amazon I am proud that our region is focusing on AG tech. Clustering areas of strength will lead to more growth. Hopfully @USDA will make the smart move, and relocate hundreds of jobs to this region. It would make a lot of sense.
@danieljfogarty @amazon NYC and DC aren't a shock. Nashville should cause #STL to reflect. Yes, they are a "magnet" city. However, we need to compete better. Small startup gains are great, we need them. We also need some big wins. These headlines put Nashville on a lot of radars.
@zach_shaw_ Zach, thanks. I love my current job, but I also care deeply about this region. We have a lot to celebrate. @Centene @Bayer4Crops @CortexSTL @DanforthCenter @pfizer to name a few - but it often feels like our gains are off set by losses. It can change.

@JustinMeyerKC @JaymeKMBZ @KCIAirport Thanks.
@JustinMeyerKC @JaymeKMBZ @KCIAirport Thanks Justin. So how will the airlines recoup the cost? Do they charge higher fares throughout their network? Do you expect landing fees to remain flat or unchanged in KC? If airlines are willing to eat this cost in KC, makes me wonder if they will do it for other airports.
@JustinMeyerKC @JaymeKMBZ @KCIAirport I understand landing fees are charged by the airport to the carriers. My assumption is those fees will need to increase to cover the construction costs. If the deal doesn't involve any tax dollars, I assume it's user generated. That said, I'm sure it's more complex.
@JustinMeyerKC @JaymeKMBZ @KCIAirport So how is it paid for? Is it landing fees? Will that result in higher ticket prices? I'm fascinated with the financing structure on this deal.

@JEBannor @airchoiceone Are the flights to Fort Dodge generally full? One of my first reporting jobs included covering Fort Dodge for the CBS affiliate in Des Moines. It might be worth hopping a flight to visit Taco Tico. I hope it's still around.

@markbland @JustinMeyerKC @British_Airways Mark, call me an optimist, but I think #STL region is a great place to live. Also, I believe the airlines will go where they can make money. Seems to me #STL &amp; #KC are good candidates for this service. I've lived in both.
@JustinMeyerKC Very good point. We need to start asking. Thanks for your insight. This is a great discussion topic.
This is great insight from @JustinMeyerKC in #KC. He works to recruit airlines. Today @British_Airways announced non stop service to Charleston, SC - a market much smaller than #STL &amp; #KC. Here are some numbers to ponder as we wonder why #STL still doesn't have this service. https://t.co/FGv7ZyUClm
@JustinMeyerKC Very interesting. So it's pretty clear St. Louis sends quite a few additional passengers to Europe each week. Thanks for your insight @JustinMeyerKC
@JustinMeyerKC Justin, curious. CHS claims 2100 passengers a week to Europe. I believe St. Louis claims between 300-400 during peak season. Are KC numbers similar? Wondering who's next.
@asraza Perhaps, but other markets have image problems as well. Airlines go were demand exists. If Charleston can support non stop to Europe it's hard to imagine STL can't.
Looks like @wow_air is disappointed in a lot of markets this week. Add NYC and Dallas to the list. https://t.co/iByRsY69vX
@AviationStl According to a story in their local paper 2100 people fly between Charleston and Europe weekly. The metro population is around 600,000 people vs nearly 3 million in St. Louis.
@AviationStl It's become impossible to predict what's next. Never suspected Charleston was even on the radar.
@Beganovic_85 @dipnotz No question many details need to be worked out. It will be interesting to watch.
@Beganovic_85 @dipnotz Denis, I get the impression this would require BIG time private financing. MODOT wouldn't be footing the bill, at least that's my understanding. That said, connecting #STL and #KC would create a midwest mega region. Fun to imagine.
Interesting https://t.co/3DPigWYp0u

@AviationStl @JustinMeyerKC Thanks Justin. How’s @Icelandair air doing in KC?
@JustinMeyerKC @TransportStats Thanks Justin.
@JustinMeyerKC How is that determined? I see an extra 95 passengers at KCI but St. Louis still appears to have more O &amp; D traffic than KC overall.  Is that correct?
PER WOW: 	"Ahead of the summer the decision was taken to add the fifth flight to STL during the peak summer season. At that point STL was showing good signs in terms of demand pickup and yields. However, the end result was not satisfactory and STL didn’t achieve its targets."
I pushed back and received this from the airline. They wanted flights to be 90 percent full. 		Hi,		WOW air is a low cost airline and load factor of at least 90% is always the goal. The route did not achieve the target.		Best Regards
@STLDisneyMom2 I pushed back and asked again. Here's what I received from WOW. 		Hi,		WOW air is a low cost airline and load factor of at least 90% is always the goal. The route did not achieve the target.		Best Regards
I just asked WOW what kind of "targets" they were hoping to achieve. Here's the response. Hi,		"The route did not achieve the targets set.		Best Regards"
It's interesting that @wow_air is claiming "disappointment" in the STL market. They added a fifth daily flight even before flights began. Would that have been added if demand didn't exist? https://t.co/zPovrISWck
@AviationStl @wow_air @flystl Yes, a WOW spokesperson included that information in an email sent to me this morning.
Hmmmm. @wow_air calls St. Louis a "disappointment" Airline claims load factors did not achieve targets set at the beginning. @flystl claims market demand was strong. Looks like WOW is also disappointed in Cincinnati and Cleveland - airline is leaving those markets as well.
A couple of shocking numbers. 1.) Sears has lost 11 BILLION dollars. 2.) Sears has 460 million worth of outstanding gift cards waiting to be redeemed. https://t.co/gvejbkAtXH
@asraza According to the airport passenger loads were strong. Between 70 &amp; 80 percent. Keep in mind that's not a big business destination. I'm seeing online info about financial woes facing WOW. Still disappointing.
I'm glad to see @Icelandair is now following me on twitter. Any chance you guys want to start non stop flights between @flystl. Our region has nearly 3 million people, and supported @wow_air despite their decision to call it quits.
@WJohnson68 @publiceyestl It's certainly a bummer for our market. It's frustrating for #STL. We remain one of the largest metro's without direct European service, when many smaller metro's are getting those flights.
@publiceyestl @WJohnson68 I doubt they pop up in KC. The KC market is already served by Iceland Air. It's a seasonal route. I'm seeing several online sources indicating WOW is facing some financial hurdles. Jeff Lea @flystl tells me passenger loads were between 70 and 80 percent.
@AviationStl @flystl Have you seen the numbers?
Is it us? Or is it them? This online publication doesn't paint a rosy financial picture for @wow_air. Is this one reason they are halting @flystl service? https://t.co/hF6A7t47tv
WOW Air will no longer service St. Louis after January 7th. https://t.co/JFyzGaVYSE
@unaccompflyer @AviationStl @wow_air @flystl Are you aware of any other WOW markets impacted?
@AviationStl @wow_air @flystl Is this based on passenger load factors? I was under the impression things were going well for @wow_air in #STL.

@AviationStl @HBelz4 Not trying to be critical - but @flystl needs more than a seasonal European offering that operates twice a week. If holding back means getting something better I get it. Established daily service will grow BUSINESS &amp; LEISURE. Resources should be focused on getting that done.

@AviationStl After all. Isn’t KC getting a brand new airport? I’m told tax dollars aren’t being used - at least that’s how it was sold to voters. If that’s a private public partnership how do they retain control?
@AviationStl My first question. If this deal is worth billions are we getting a brand new airport? If the goal is for a private company to make money wouldn’t that improve their odds with modernized food, retail and other options? Will landing fees increase? So many questions.

St. Louis region is home to 10 #Fortune500 companies. Up from 9 last year according to @stltoday https://t.co/5X45gASn9C Post Holdings could crack the list next year at #512. 16 #STL companies make #Fortune1000.
@michaelcalhoun @unaccompflyer @AviationStl If southwest ever code shared with a European carrier we would have a direct. No question with the amount of connections through here.
@michaelcalhoun @unaccompflyer @AviationStl I have three neighbors going to Germany tomorrow.  THREE! Another headed there in June.
@michaelcalhoun @unaccompflyer @AviationStl Bingo. Convinced there’s a path forward and it would be successful.
@michaelcalhoun @unaccompflyer @AviationStl Also I fell Paris is a tougher sell. More tourist based. London could be supported as business and tourist destination from STL.
@michaelcalhoun @unaccompflyer @AviationStl Slay did personal pitch to BA.
@unaccompflyer @AviationStl Makes no sense to me. A metro of nearly 3 million people.  Largest in US without direct mainland service. Big corporate city.  I have three neighbors going to Europe tomorrow. Connecting through MSP. This needs to change.
@iantmcfarland @scribe827 @WillT0tten @JarrettTSutton There’s always the potential @HyperloopOne
@iantmcfarland @scribe827 @WillT0tten @JarrettTSutton Best of luck on that side of state.  I truly wish both regions much success.  In my opinion both are great sports cities.
@iantmcfarland @scribe827 @WillT0tten @JarrettTSutton All fair points I’ve lived and worked in both cities. I know KC has a lot of hometown pride - STL does as well. STL also has big corporate base. Remember Proposed NFL stadium had naming rights sold here. Seems this region could support another if KC is talking about 4.
@iantmcfarland @scribe827 @WillT0tten @JarrettTSutton Take STL out of the equation.  I guess I would still need to see an independent study showing how any region of 2 million could support 4 teams without cannibalizing one of them.
@iantmcfarland @scribe827 @WillT0tten @JarrettTSutton St Louis metro is nearly 3 million people and only has two pro teams.  KC metro around 2.1 and has three including MLS. Could the KC metro support a fourth with NBA?
@unaccompflyer @AviationStl Why have talks fizzled?
@AviationStl @unaccompflyer I always forget about Columbus - a growing metro - but still significantly smaller than #STL. Thoughts on why Delta or AA wouldn't see potential here vs there??? Also, see Indy has Paris direct on Delta. We must be getting close.
@AviationStl @unaccompflyer No question it would be a big deal for our region. Who's our primary competition this time around?
@AviationStl @unaccompflyer What tells you this summer? I still think it was between #STL and #Nashville last year. Pretty sure we are the largest metro in US without direct to mainland Europe.

@EdwardDomain @PCMag @amazon @googlefiber @joshbehavesci @jstriebel22 @CortexSTL @ArchGrants Good discussion. Thanks Edward. Maybe KC and STL should offer joint bid. 25000 @amazon employees in each city connected by a hyper loop.
@EdwardDomain @PCMag @amazon @googlefiber @joshbehavesci @jstriebel22 @CortexSTL @ArchGrants I think you hit the nail on the head.  Deserved or not.  I drive by Cortex daily and watch the cranes and progress.  Outsiders should see it
@EdwardDomain @PCMag @amazon @googlefiber @joshbehavesci @jstriebel22 @CortexSTL @Square @Microsoft No question KC would fall short on that one as well.
@EdwardDomain @PCMag @amazon @googlefiber @joshbehavesci @jstriebel22 @CortexSTL @ArchGrants Is KC higher tier? And if so what companies put it in that tier? Truly trying to understand. Lived In KC for 3 years. Love both cities.
@EdwardDomain @PCMag @amazon @googlefiber @joshbehavesci @jstriebel22 @CortexSTL The entire district.  Adding names like @Square @Microsoft lately.  Agree Kauffman a big deal.  That said STL has Arch Grants, Trex.  Etc
@EdwardDomain @PCMag @amazon @googlefiber @joshbehavesci @jstriebel22 Does KC have something comparable to @CortexSTL? Curious how the cities compare.
