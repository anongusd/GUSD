@Gregory35920211 @john_iamme @CherylDuisberg @charliekirk11 That I may be able to agree with.  And I can understand reading the Bible for literary value.  I read several passages in school for their poetic importance.  But any level of teaching it as truth is both immoral and illegal.
@Gregory35920211 @john_iamme @CherylDuisberg @charliekirk11 Saying there is does not make it true.  You have to provide factual evidence to support a claim.  Especially such a massive one.  And you can't use the Bible as evidence
@john_iamme @Gregory35920211 @CherylDuisberg @charliekirk11 He also believed that God and any divine power were uninvolved in our daily life.  And that they should be kept outside of the government in every manner.
@john_iamme @Gregory35920211 @CherylDuisberg @charliekirk11 Exactly!  The 1A prevents any prohibition on religion by the federal government (free exercise clause).  It also prevents promotion of religion, like school Bible reading (establishment clause). This was then made applicable to the states through the due process clause of the 14A
@lynnv378 Everyone
@john_iamme @Gregory35920211 @CherylDuisberg @charliekirk11 And the government has acknowledged  a key difference between religion in schools and with legislative chaplins.  		Children are easily impressionable and have no choice in the matter.		Legislators have formed their beliefs and have a choice to partake in this activity.
@john_iamme @Gregory35920211 @CherylDuisberg @charliekirk11 I'm not arguing that Jefferson believed in a god.  He did.  Though it wasn't a Christian god.  Jefferson was a Deist.
@Gregory35920211 @john_iamme @CherylDuisberg @charliekirk11 The issue is it doesn't matter what God wants.  Because there is no God.
@Gregory35920211 @john_iamme @CherylDuisberg @charliekirk11 Jefferson was right when he declared these freedoms.  It would impose upon say a Muslim or Buddhist's civil liberties to force Bible readings in school.
@dave4Biz @ObnoxBE @JohnnyIMHO @ljxjah @BBentley322 @charliekirk11 Than maybe you should keep quiet Dave.  You have provided zero factual basis for anything youve said.
@dave4Biz @JohnnyIMHO @ljxjah @BBentley322 @charliekirk11 Maybe by the Catholics.  Both Lutherans?  They have different opinions.  SDA? Also different. Mormonism? Extremely different!
@Gregory35920211 @CherylDuisberg @charliekirk11 and putting Bible reading in schools would be having the government involved in church. Even from a Christian point of view, who decides what's to be taught?  Which translation?  What books are included?  Catholic interpretation? Lutheran? Puritan? 		That's why it's not in school
@Gregory35920211 @CherylDuisberg @charliekirk11 So right there, from a man who heavily influenced the Bill of Rights, you have even stronger evidence that that IS what the 1st amendment's first two clauses mean.
@Gregory35920211 @CherylDuisberg @charliekirk11 I was actually going to bring that up!		In those letters Jefferson says the Establishment Clause is "building a wall of separation between church and state"!		Jefferson also says no favors shall be done for any religious sect.
@Gregory35920211 @CherylDuisberg @charliekirk11 From my pocket Constitution:	"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof..."		Thats the separation, right there.  School mandated Bible reading would be in violation of the Establishment Clause of the 1st Amendment
@literaryeric @lauralamaye What do you have against Calvinists lol?
@Tru_Raza @EricBachelder6 @charliekirk11 Actually, I took history classes literally every year of school.  		Never took a Bible class though
@Gregory35920211 @CherylDuisberg @charliekirk11 Separation of Church and State is DEFINITELY law.  It's the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.  As in the Supreme Law of the Land. 		So, not just a thought.
@disturbed_one98 @brettlewin @junior0319 @Azwatkins @charliekirk11 Exactly.  So a school cannot force a child to participate in religious activities, including the reading of the Bible.  That's an inherent violation of the First Amendment.
@dave4Biz @JohnnyIMHO @ljxjah @BBentley322 @charliekirk11 What do you say to the fact that Christians across the world cannot agree on a single translation of the Bible?  Or even the fact that they can't agree on a single set of canon books.
@dave4Biz @ljxjah @BBentley322 @JohnnyIMHO @charliekirk11 -and I could totally write another book of the Bible, that preached the same message, and claimed itself as the truth.  That doesn't make it true, or part of the Bible.  		That's Mormonism, by the way.
@BBentley322 @JohnnyIMHO @charliekirk11 You can't prove something is true by saying that thing says it is true.  That's circular logic, and it's inherently flawed.  Prove it with outside evidence.
@charliekirk11 Because the Bible is a work of fiction that propagates lies.		Other religions believe that their holy books are also great. One of the great aspects of America is our separation of Church and State.  It would be unjust to force people of other faiths to read the Bible.

@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Issue is that's not what the 25th amendment is for.  It deals with the President being too mentally/physically disabled to carry out the oath of office. Not crimes, like treason.		You can remove presidents for "high crimes" but that requires impeachment. Which is different
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump The issue is, the 25th amendment takes people out of office for disability.  Not for crimes, that's why we have impeachment.

@commiebythebay @brinylon @fiahfly73 @ida_skibenes There's two real key characteristics of abortion that make it immoral	-The child is already alive, and you are killing it.	-The child has potential, and you are eliminating it.		Slaughtering cattle for meat only qualifies in one of those categories.
@mcrook11 @fiahfly73 @ida_skibenes And abortion doesn't make the traumatic event go away.  Child rape is one of the worst events in the world, but nothing can undo it after the fact.		The best we can do at that point is operate with the circumstances we are given and do what we can for the mother and child.
@mcrook11 @fiahfly73 @ida_skibenes That's not really an equal comparison.		In one case, we are saving an entire human life, from womb to tomb.  		In the other case, we are maybe affecting part of a human life.
@brinylon @fiahfly73 @ida_skibenes I started out this whole string of tweets by offering by utmost sympathy.  Rape is one of the most horrible crimes possible.  		However, the circumstances of conception don't change the fact that abortion is murder.
@JDK1983 @ewarren No problem

@grimmandevil @brinylon @fiahfly73 @ida_skibenes Nice ad hominem.  Pretty irrelevant though.		Afterall, I don't care what you do with your body in the slightest.  What I do care about is that vulnerable unborn children are not murdered by their own mother.
@JDK1983 @ewarren And SuperPacs cannot donate to a campaign.  They can only create ads/spread pamphlets/etc that support the campaigns/candidates/causes that they want to.
@JDK1983 @ewarren The drawback though is that they cannot coordinate or communicate with the campaign of the candidate they are supporting.  They must operate independently of one another.  The candidate cannot tell them how to spend money, endorse ads, or anything else.
@JDK1983 @ewarren Yeah, of course. 	So "SuperPAC" is a nickname for an Independent Expenditure-only Committee. 		Under federal campaign finance law, they are allowed to take unlimited donations from any source, while campaigns and normal PACs can only take limited amounts.
@brinylon @fiahfly73 @ida_skibenes No, it is a child, and it is getting killed.  		Why shouldn't life begin at conception?  What is different?  	It has a unique genetic code.  Within a few weeks it produces its own blood and has a functioning nervous system		It is alive, and abortion is murder.

@DebraConnors1 @brianklaas It was a hunting accident.  I think Clinton's perjury and Watergate were both worse, not to mention countless older scandals like Teapot Dome Whiskey Ring.
@fiahfly73 @ida_skibenes It's totally acceptable to have Planned Parenthood, and other government agencies or charitable organizations provide therapy and aid to help people move past the trauma of rape and endure the difficulties of adolescent pregnancy. 		It is not acceptable to kill the child.
@bubbIeteaz @ida_skibenes I at least partially agree with you--mortal danger to the mother is the only case in which I believe abortion is morally acceptable. 		Outside of that though, I think the depravity of murder is greater than that of adolescent pregnancy.
@RealSaavedra Gotta love new wave Democrats
@RodneyDavis @RepHastingsFL @alexanator28
@fiahfly73 @ida_skibenes See, it's not a woman's health issue though.  It's a matter of saving a human life.
@ida_skibenes I am so sorry for you, no words of mine can attest to the horror of rape, especially of a child.		However, two wrongs don't make a right.		The child a raped woman carries is no less valuable than any other.  Abortion is murder, whether or not the child was conceived with consent.

@EricJafMN She doesn't have any say in whether they get to form.		It is literally illegal for her to interact with SuperPACs.		That's one of the defining attributes of SuperPACs.
@SmelterJones @CA_bobby77 @ewarren Read the 2nd of my 3 tweets here.

@navychef86 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump These all resulted in the death of the (usually viable) fetus.  Typically completed by an injection of potassium chloride to the child, through a medically dilated birth canal. 		So, it's not fear mongering.  It's a fact.
@navychef86 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump In 2014, the CDC reported 5578 3rd trimester abortions.  Not all areas report to the CDC though, and the Guttmacher Insititute estimated a total of 12,040 3rd trimester abortions nationwide in 2014.  These both use ≥21 weeks of gestation as the definition of 3rd trimester.
@trober86 @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump No.  It only applies when you offer the service to the general public.  The law allows you do to do whatever you want until that point.  But once you start renting out your property, you can't discriminate based on race.		Been like that since the 60s I believe
@trober86 @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump 1. You're wrong.  It's illegal to discriminate who you rent to based on race. 	2. Does it matter? It's immoral either way.

@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary You're right that government created the problems in nations like Germany, Japan, Iraq, etc.  But those problems exist whether WE have a government or not.  We then have to address them, preferably with our own government. B
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary And I'm also talking about during the cold war era!  Without government, we wouldn't have nukes, and the Soviets could have held the world hostage
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary 1) the war would have been very different, but I think we still would have won in the end.  We likely would have still gotten the nuke first, and we would have used it on Germany. 	2) The Allies considered an invasion of the Soviets at the wars end (Operation Unthinkable)
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary A large and modernized fighting force would decimate the US population.  Hunting rifles and AR-15s aren't going to stand up to tanks, cruise missiles, nuclear devices, and the rest of the arsenal that modern militaries (like our own) possess
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary Then why the hell would they apply such heavy regulations (after the financial crisis) that banks hate? Why would they take monetary policies that hinder investment performance?
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary You said that government never solved a problem.  That's what I was addressing, and have been trying to address for like 20 tweets now.
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary It's not like they attacked a population, economic, social, or political center.  And it wasnt supposed to be the first step of an invasion of America either, something they never intended on doing.
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary It was definitely preemptive.  Preemptive attacks are designed to eliminate military or industrial capabilities before the other nation takes action.  That's exactly what happened in Pearl Harbor.
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary While I still mostly disagree with you, o agree with that position more than your previously stated opinion that government has never solved a problem.
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary Where would we be if Germany had made landfall on the East Coast, and we didn't have a military?  Or if the Soviets got nukes, and we didn't have them?
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary It was way more a preemptive strike to prevent further US action in the Pacific though.  That failed of course.
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary Moreover, the IMF and World Bank are practically run by the US, and they play a huge role in the world financial system!
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary Industrial base and GDP is a huge part of why we control the economy!  Certainly not something England compare to!  Hell, CA has a greater GDO than the UK.  Moreover, the fed's monetary policy is controlled by the governors and the chairman who are regularly changed.
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary I have no idea what you even begin to mean by that.  The governors and chair man guide the monetary policy, and they're regularly replaced.  Additionally, we practically control the IMF and the World Bank!
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary And regardless of whether it was against an act of aggression or not, we need a military for defense purposes. Other nations would have come for our land and resources long ago if we had a no military.  Government sure solved that issue.
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary They were wrong of course.
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary Regardless though, that's not even why they attacked.  They believed Pearl Harbor would disable the American Navy, and prevent US interference as they spread across British and Dutch holdings in the Pacific, establishing their so called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere"
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary No, I totally get that.  The unfunded social security liability is a huge issue, but it doesn't mean we are "enslaved". So long as we continue to control the international monetary system, and maintain economic dominance, we will be more than fine.

@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary Also.  Rockefeller was dead and standard oil had been broken up by the time WW2 started
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary 1. You're right, submarine warfare was awful.  It was also universal, it wasnt just against the US.  And if you think it was so bad, why did FDR wait till PH? 	2. It wasn't just FDR.  Practically every member of Congress voted for the Dec of War.	3. Still haven't addressed Italy
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary And what do you even mean we were mercenaries?
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary Being invaded is very often how people come under tyrannical rule...
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary You're right, we have some of the world's loosest gun rights, totally oppression.  Entirely free speech, wow so much oppression.  Social welfare programs?  I sure feel enslaved.  An entirely volunteer military?  So much slavery.

@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary It's a democracy now though.
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary Of course not!  Thats the point.  Remember Social Contract Theory?  Consent of the governed?  The stuff your heroes the framers loved?
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary I would say it's better than being taken over by Saddam.
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary Also.  I was referring to disposing of Saddam and then defeating ISIS when I said twice.  Not talking about Desert Storm
@KjrMolon @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary Glad to finally agree with someone on Twitter then lol
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary Didn't we at least free Kuwait then?
@spiceykim @davidmweissman Dude, he literally watched the Civil War start and did nothing.  No other president has let the country tear itself apart, resulting in 620,000 casualties.
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary Also.  There was no act of aggression from Germany or Italy.
I apologize to all of my nonpolitical followers for my recent surge of political posts.  Feel free to mute me
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary Okay.  Maybe that's true of the Axis nations.  What about all the others I listed?
@KjrMolon @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary If someone went to Yale and Harvard, has been a judge for 20 years, but believes the Constitution is useless or has communist or Nazi beliefs...I think we definitely should consider their beliefs on govn.  It's important.  They help define our nation.
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary I didn't say who did it, just said it happened.  I'm actually conservative.  And I agree with you the GOP has betrayed their values.  I agree that govn must be limited.  I just don't think it's useless.  Clearly you don't either, or else you wouldn't love the Constitution so much
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary And we always pay for it.  Via taxes! That's the whole point of government man!  To put our collective resources together for something greater!
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary Additionally, people "loving" it isn't a very textualist/originalist viewpoint.  		The expectations and standard of society are actually the basis of a Living Constitutional doctrine!  You're arguing my point.
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary But without the government it doesn't happen.  Also, there are completely government run operations called "government corporations" like the TVA and Amtrak
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary Would you rather we let other, more awful nations dominate space?
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary They created Velcro (and many other inventions) using government funds and contracts though!
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary But they're used for citizens now!  And that has caused business to prosper. Millions of miles of road have been laid by the government!		Also, really? What nations?  	Germany	Japan	Italy	All of the Soviet Bloc	Iraq twice	South Korea	Among others
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary Your emphasis of the invasion of privacy only further proves my point.
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary Yes, however people have a reasonable expectation of privacy on their property, as decided as by SCOTUS. For example, putting up fence establishes such an expectation.  Yet satellites can photograph right over it.
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary 1. Many think the War Powers Act is uncon. under Article 2	2.  Don't you think the use of nuclear devices qualifies as war?  Yet the Pres doesn't need cong. approval?	3. Isn't it wrong that wars (Vietnam, Korea, Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, etc) have occurred without a dec of war?
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary Why states?  The Constitution itself states the federal government is superior!
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary Also I agree that government is typically the issue.  But it definitely has solved problems.  		We have roads because of govn.	We have freed nations from tyranny via govn 	We went to the Moon because of govn.  	We have Velcro, duct tape and microwaves via govn. 	Many, many more
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary How do we handle abortion rights, something the Constitution never mentions?
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary We don't consent to satellite photography of our homes and properties

@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary I agree that the founders beliefs are an invaluable asset in guiding constitutional interpretation.		There are modern issues that can't be solved by 18th century political philosophy though.  Sometimes other viewpoints are needed, giving us what some call a "living Constitution".
@KjrMolon @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary You're sort of right.  	-Under the Constitution, the President chooses nominees	--In reality, senators usually suggest nominees to the President	---The committee then can turn down nominees they disapprove of	---The Senate can then also turn down nominees		So essentially, they do
@crisp_aw @OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary How you interpret the Constitution IS your general belief on government...which is what I said
@OrenKessler @LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary Fun fact: conservative and liberal doesn't necessary mean political.  It also refers to general beliefs on how government should work, which is something all judges have, and that we should consider in selecting them.

@SaraStapleton61 @DanMartin314 @realDonaldTrump @DRUDGE_REPORT Why would you ever put it in cash?  At least put into a low yield bond or something, because you're actually losing money due to inflation if it's in cash.

@itsKhyamii That comes out to 282 billion dollars if everyone went to in state public schools. Out-of-state public and private schools have much higher tuitions, meaning they boost this figure by much more.  	So the 77 billion figure provided isn't even in the right ballpark.	2/
@itsKhyamii I hate that this has so many retweets, because it's wrong.	1.  The F-35 program has been funded across many years by TEN countries. 	2.  The "make college free" number is wrong. 19.9 million students are enrolled in college.  Average in-state public college cost is $14,210. 		1/

@CibaoJoba @MaischSuzette @AnnCoulter I am not.
@my2meows @JCor137 @MaischSuzette @AnnCoulter And what I'm saying is that lowering congressional pay only makes that issue worse.
@my2meows @JCor137 @MaischSuzette @AnnCoulter Weird subject change. 		But yeah, that's marginal rates, how almost all income taxation in the US works.  		That's not really what we were discussing though...
@my2meows @JCor137 @MaischSuzette @AnnCoulter 1. Not all of them do.  This would make it so they would all need to.  	2. Trust me, I'm worried about lots of issues. This just happens to be the tweet you found.

@hsg516 @SCOTUSblog Oh for sure.  Major let down last year.  I think the court has a chance to set some major precedent here, and hopefully do a lot of good.  		It should be noted though that justices usually follow recommendation of their clerks when granting cert these days.

@SCOTUSblog Let's hope they don't take a punt on gerrymandering like they did last session
@SenTedCruz @RepRooney Seems like a pretty decent idea, maybe longer for reps though.  		Would you leave the Senate in 2024, at the end of your second term, even if this doesn't pass though?
@repdavidtrone @HouseDemocrats Everyone is like "look at the cool stuff 5 billion dollars could do"...but we already fund a lot of stupid shit...and not these super cool and helpful projects.
@OldBaconFace @MaischSuzette @AnnCoulter I'd say that's pretty fair.  An average amount of taxation on their congressional salary, and then higher levels on any outside income.  	That could even dissuade against congresspeople trying to make additional money while in office, and therefore help mitigate corruption.
@OldBaconFace @MaischSuzette @AnnCoulter Are taking all of them at 70% or just the ones with extra income?
@MaischSuzette @AnnCoulter Except that we ask to have a home in DC and their district.  We also ask for them to pay for transport back and forth.  Plus, DC has one of the highest costs of living in the country.
Help out this important cause. https://t.co/7iihCqtyuH
@MaischSuzette @AnnCoulter 1. Why not cut their pay by 70%?  It seems silly for taxpayers to give and immediately take it back.  	2. That would limit congressional membership to the wealthy.  Already, we have members quitting because they can't afford the costs associated with the job on the salary alone.
@David19610512 1. Thank you for your service.	2. I taught you meant a universal flat tax rate of 10%	3. 10% for retirees on set limited incomes is fairly reasonable.
@bonniequeue Hate speech is protected under free speech. The only time it loses this protection is when it presents/causes danger to someone.		That's just for the gov'n though. Any business or person is welcome to disagree, and in most cases cannot be forced to host speech they disagree with.

@bellacrossx @TheSeattle206 @setuchainz That's funny, because young boys have DEFINITELY been raped by older women.
@KamalaHarris You mean those polygraph tests that the psychological community long ago condemned as useless?  The ones inadmissible in Federal courts?  The same polygraph tests generally believed to be unreliable?  Gotta make sure we are talking about the same ones here.
@DougJones You vote no?  Is that if we have further investigation or not?  Probably doesn't matter, you had made up your mind before Ford's story was leaked.
@tellxandy @Make_LifePretty @KamalaHarris What might they investigate?  The absence of physical evidence?  The lack of corroborating witnesses?  The unreliable, inadmissible polygraph results?  Go to the unknown place it all occurred at?  These all sound like great leads to investigate.
@Basquerading @FixesItself @thehill @GOP Most people do tend to lose their shit when millions of people believe they do horrible things they never did.  		RBG was used as a comparison.  The left loves her and she's a partisan, so they can hardly criticize Kavanaugh for partisanship.
@Basquerading @FixesItself @thehill @GOP 1.  I thought his tone was powerful, and righteously angry.	2. Even if he was rude, that frankly doesn't matter.  All that matters are the verity of the accusations and his constitutional beliefs.
@anitaluvscapri @funkybuddhabead @DickDurbin Renate?  A woman who signed the letter saying that Kavanaugh was a good and upstanding man, sure Ill ask her.
@ktmccabe2 @BenCardinforMD And what are they going to investigate?	The uses of esoteric slang from the last century?  Are we going to listen to Dr. Ford's uncorroborated testimony more?  Maybe we will administer some more unreliable, and inadmissible polygraphs.  Sounds like a solid investigation 👌
@desmoore1 @funkybuddhabead @DickDurbin I didn't believe a woman recalling a drunken incident in the last century with no details, no physical evidence, and no corroborating testimony?  How logical
@Basquerading @FixesItself @thehill @GOP Are you saying that if you're egocentric, you're automatically an alcoholic?  Also, it's not like the Left's Saint RBG has shown herself to be a partisan.
@FixesItself @Basquerading @thehill @GOP I'm pretty sure since he's been a judge on the nation's second highest court for a decade, he probably has a pretty good idea that this is serious.  Just a thought.
@__CallMeBen @MrWildcat86 @CBSNews @LindseyGrahamSC @senatemajldr 1. That's what I was talking about in my 1st comment.  Republicans stole Garlands's seat, but they were straightforward about it.  	2. If you have the votes to stop a nomination, you can.  If you have the votes to confirm, you can.  End of story.  Republicans had it then &amp; now
@FixesItself @Basquerading @thehill I would probably be fine if I knew he was a heart surgeon who had been doing it for years, had the second  highest medical post in the country, and who the rest of the hospital staff said was a real great guy.
@Basquerading @thehill @FixesItself Let's imagine for a moment he is innocent, which remains a distinct possibility.  How would you feel, after a life of hard work and accomplishment, of being accused of a horrible, atrocious crime?  I know I'd get a tad emotional.
@SenKamalaHarris I really love how you just blew by the fact that polygraphs are unreliable and unadmissible. Really shows your dedication to the facts.
@MrWildcat86 @CBSNews @LindseyGrahamSC @senatemajldr At least Republicans were fairly straightforward about what they were doing.  Democrats may be doing the same, but they're lying about it.  They say they're protecting a woman, but they're just acting in self interest.  They could have had the truth, but they sat on the letter.
@CBSNews I love Graham so much.

@meechebucco @Kidrock704 @SenSchumer Try to remember that several Democrats voted yes on Gorsuch.
@gerryflood8 @BeKindOkk @Michellemonkey4 @SenSchumer You should check your numbers here.  According to Bloomberg news, multimillionaires will actually pay tens of thousands more next year.   Meanwhile, a low income family will pay nearly a thousand less in taxes under the new law.  https://t.co/Y7rzZWBfyG
@JeffHertler @SenateMajLdr @JohnCornyn Remind me what the Obama Administration said about that?
@1taoguy @SenateMajLdr @JohnCornyn Even more interesting that Democratic Senators are repeating it now then 🤔
@AdamKrouse @senorrinhatch Woah woah.  Let's point out that there have only been 3 in that time, and that before that, he voted yes on Breyer and Ginsburg.  Gotta tell the whole story.
@CovfefeMcGuffin @senorrinhatch He voted yes on both Breyer and Ginsburg, both of whom are liberals.
@benshapiro @Ocasio2018 I was genuinely excited to see if this was real, but this is so much better.

@thehill Everyone: SCOTUS has become a right wing tool to support hard line Christian values, and we can no longer trust them.	SCOTUS: Nope
@DWStweets All of these supreme Court decisions would have been made under Obama.  Gorsuch and Scalia share many of the same values, and therefore, nothing has changed.  This week of SCOTUS news is practically unrelated to President Trump.
@MurrayCampaign You are aware that some conservatives were with the majority decision on Roe v Wade, right?  I mean Burger and Blackmun were conservatives, Stewart and Powell were moderates.  Even more, Blackmun wrote the actual opinion.  Don't worry, Roe v Wade isn't going anywhere.
@SoapyCup @thehill You know that three Democrats voted for Gorsuch, right?
@MurrayCampaign You say you want to increase freedom to join unions.  Shouldn't a twin right of this be the freedom to not join a union?  Isn't that what Janus granted?  Why should people be forced to pay Union dues?
@SenFeinstein The thing is, Trump doesn't want two states at peace.  Trump is almost certainly striving for a one state solution.  If you see that as the final goal, he's doing great.		Besides, diplomacy has never worked with the Palestinians.
@SenFeinstein You are aware that some conservatives were with the majority decision on Roe v Wade, right?  I mean Burger and Blackmun were conservatives, Stewart and Powell were moderates.  Even more, Blackmun wrote the actual opinion.  Don't worry, Roe v Wade isn't going anywhere.

@ChrisMurphyCT @poggispaghetti You also realize that that the balance e of the court has not changed yet, right?  Scalia would have made practically all the same decisions as Gorsuch.  This isn't a new thing

@zipillinois @smkelly53 @DickDurbin If the checks and balances had failed, there would be no Obamacare.	If they had failed, there would be a border wall.	If they had failed, there would be no Russia investigation.	The government is still functioning.
@hannagittlesmom @HunterGStark @lisamurkowski I think it's horrific.  But it's also something we've been doing for ages.  Long before Obama.
@BrennanBartley @qjurecic I mean even Ginsburg has expressed some issue with Roe.  She loves the judgement and results, obviously, but some of the reasoning and ripple effects she disagrees with.
@BrennanBartley @qjurecic It's totally possible.  Certiorari only requires four justices.  With such a major issue, I find it totally plausible that 4 of them could find reason to bring it before the Supreme Court.
@BrennanBartley @qjurecic I find it entirely possible that abortion rights become more restricted, with two doctor approval, no state funding, earlier limits, etc (which, for the record, I applaud).  But I believe it will remain legal in all 50 states.
@BrennanBartley @qjurecic No idea what the new justice will be like though.  That could go either way.
@BrennanBartley @qjurecic Alito has shown a heavy respect for precedent.  He has gone on record on several occasions saying that under stare decisis, he views Roe as protected.  I know less about Gorsuch's position, but he has shared the same opinions.
@Kevzin @chrislhayes @qjurecic You know that three of the four justices who oppossed Obergefell v. Hodges only did so because they believed it was the responsibility of the legislature, not the judiciary, right?
@Austin12Evans @chrislhayes @qjurecic Afterall, some conservatives were with the majority decision on Roe v Wade, right?  I mean Burger and Blackmun were conservatives, Stewart and Powell were moderates.  Even more, Blackmun wrote the actual opinion.  Don't worry, Roe v Wade isn't going anywhere.
@Austin12Evans @chrislhayes @qjurecic No not really.  They might strip some of the state sponsored abortion stuff, but that's it.

@DanRather @brianschatz Justice Kennedy is an incredibly smart man, with respect from nearly everyone.  If he thought that retiring now would put this nation in danger, he wouldn't do it.  Gorsuch must have met Kennedy's standards.  Kennedy would not retire if he wasn't confident in his successor.
@occasionl_animl @cogburn44 @ACLU It is super long, you're right.  But shorter and logistics get unreasonable.  If that happens, people get reactionary and will fight back.  Then there's a higher chance it takes even longer or never happens
@Capitan00teri @lisamurkowski No problem.  You're completely right that the will of the people must be heard.  That's why I'm politically active.  However, one thing I will never do is back off.
@YadhiraOrtiz4 @HunterGStark @lisamurkowski You're right, he cannot pardon himself from impeachment.  That's indisputable.  No single justice on the court will change that.  Even if both his justices side with him, it'll be 7-2.
@HunterGStark @lisamurkowski Everyone has to operate on what is likely.  Nobody can operate based on every possible eventuality.
@SenSherrodBrown Will the fight keep going when people stop paying the union dues?  After all, public union due payment dropped 40% in Wisconsin when they weren't forced to pay dues.  The same will be true across the nation.
@ChrisMurphyCT It was as much the people having a chance to vote out Republican Senators in 2016 as it was choosing a new President.		The Senate chose not to confirm Garland, as he didn't align with their values.  Now, if the president and 50 senators agree, they can do their duty again.
@Capitan00teri @lisamurkowski I'll go ahead and remind you that Nixon was never actually impeached.  These could go down very different route.  Regardless, such issues will likely not be decided by a single justice.  Ex: US v. Nixon was unanimous
@HunterGStark @lisamurkowski -I don't really understand a constitutional issue with POTUS firing those people.	-A Mueller indictment is unlikely I'd say, as Congressional Democrats would go for impeachment and removal instead	-A self-pardon would almost certainly be struck down by rest of court.  MAYBE 7-2
@Capitan00teri @lisamurkowski -Impeachment and removal proceedings don't go to SCOTUS.  	-They go to both houses of Congress, where the Chief Justice presides. 	-The Chief Justice position is not available here.	-Therefore, your argument is invalid.
@gescim @lisamurkowski If you're talking about the TransAm case, you need to know that Gorsuch openly said he wished that was a decision he didn't have to make.  He said he disagreed with the law.  However, it is a judge's duty to uphold and interpret the law, not decide based on their own morals.
@HunterGStark @lisamurkowski -Impeachment and removal proceedings don't go to SCOTUS.  	-They go to both houses of Congress, where the Chief Justice presides. 	-The Chief Justice position is not available here.	-Therefore, your argument is invalid.

@KamalaHarris I think we already did way in.  We should abandon the McConnell Rule, and return to the norm.
@ChrisMurphyCT @SenateMajLdr Please remember that last time, three Democrats crossed party lines to confirm Gorsuch.  I anticipate the same here.
@SenatorMenendez -Calls Kennedy distinguished 	-Attacks Gorsuch for recent decisions	-Doesn't realize that Kennedy joined Gorsuch on those decisions		Nice one Menendez
@rgreenparadox @RustyBucketGH @SenFeinstein Are you actually just pulling these dates out of your ass? What is this based on?  You need to at least acknowledge the potential of him serving a full four years.

@yoerges_roger @KevinMc17198218 @salonivdesai @KamalaHarris Sorry.  They happened to have changed the Senate rules for this already.  Republicans will get the justice they want.
@KamalaHarris The people on the list include State Supreme Court Justices, Federal District Court Justices, and Circuit Court Justices.  If those are non-starters, I don't know what more you want.  		Besides, Gorsuch has already shown himself to be a respectable justice on the court.
@ChrisMurphyCT Even if Democrats do stoop to the same level as Republicans did with Garland, there isn't much they can do to stop it.
@SenSherrodBrown Do the current Supreme Court justices not have a respected record?  All of them except Gorsuch are pre-Trump veterans, and even he has an impressive resume.  Just because you disagree, it doesn't mean the Court is wrong.
@DickDurbin If you can find me anywhere in the Janus decision where it prevents someone from joining a union...please do.  All I read was the freedom to not pay union dues in the public sector being restored.
@thehill A church with anti-LGBT views?  Who's ever heard of that?  It's not like that idea is written in their holy book or something.
@SenatorMenendez If people really agreed with you here, than why did Wisconsin lose 40% of total Union membership in just a few years when they enabled public employees to not pay Union dues.  And why are there hardly any private sector unions left?  Most Americans simply don't want unions.
@SenatorCantwell Overturning precedent is not a bad thing.  Abood being overturned is just another example of the Supreme Court correcting it's past mistakes.  That makes two this week, if anyone is counting.
@Campbell2976 Are you implying that I don't know the history of the Holocaust?  Not only did I learn it in school, but my Roma relatives have told me stories of the war, trying to survive in Germany.  Trust me, Trump's buffoonery is literally nothing when compared to the murder of millions
@PoetTLStarr @repjohnlewis Just a reminder.  Most Muslim immigrants are still able to come to America. https://t.co/EoO6PcyB45
@cheeseman_kris @repjohnlewis @terrysuesweeten The Supreme Court is not responsible for what the law is, they simply interpret the facts.  Under the current law, as passed by Congress decades ago, this is perfectly legal.
@SaltedJosh @repjohnlewis @laurenduca Even if you honestly believe Gorsuch doesn't belong on the Court, the other four justices of the majority have been appointed from across the decades, and their confirmation held with all tradition.
@Zephoraliz @Donnat_01 @repjohnlewis Yes, yes we are.  The crimes of Trump are nothing compared to those of the Third Reich.
@repjohnlewis If you think this is decision is as horrific as saying that African Americans aren't human, then you truly have a tilted worldview.
@ACLU It's one thing to assault the decision of Gorsuch, who Trump appointed recently.  It's another to assault the other four veteran justices of the court, including the Chief Justice, who formed the majority.  This is the law now.
@ACLU It's funny to compare this decision to Korematsu, when SCOTUS denounced Korematsu today...literally within hours of upholding the travel ban.
@smg19810 @SenatorCarper @POTUS Or Trump would have to withdraw the order.  The only other feasible way would be for Congress to repeal The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952...both also unlikely
@smg19810 @SenatorCarper @POTUS The only way to overrule this decision would be a contrasting SCOTUS decision, or a Con amendment.  Both unlikely.

@JeremyECrawford Creation is an illusion spell (PHB, 229), and illusion spells are defined as tricking people into sensing things that are not there (PHB, 203).  Does this mean that creation has no tangible effect?  EX: does dropping a "created" object damage creatures below it?
@JeremyECrawford One of my wizard players uses Creation to make blocks of platinum high in the air.  Then the resulting damage from the falling mads on enemies below is usually a one hit KO.  Is there any rules this is against?  It's incredibly powerful for a 5th level spell.
@JeremyECrawford My players keep flying up, casting conjure animals to create dinosaurs and letting them fall on enemies.  I feel this should be against the rules somehow...but can't find a reason?  Is it?
