@realDonaldTrump Everyone, you know, people everywhere HATE YOU. No one will ever love you as much as you love yourself. The whole WORLD is LAUGHING AT YOU!  You are just too STUPID to realize it. Everyone knows how INSECURE you are. It makes you MEAN.
@realDonaldTrump In your next life you will come back as a person of color, no money, no education, homeless, no food, ragged clothes and you will be at the mercy of people who spend their lives doing good. You will not be worthy of goodness. Enjoy
@realDonaldTrump Is it because these REAL PRESIDENTS, etc. won their elections without CHEATING?  You talk voter fraud, but the only voter frauds I heard of in 2016 were voting for YOU. You didn‚Äôt talk about that, did you?!?  So, so sad you are.
@realDonaldTrump Why do you treat OUR ALLIES like enemies?  Why do you treat OUR ENEMIES like YOUR ALLIES?  Is it because you are comfortable with DICTATORS?  Or is it because leaders in the EU, CANADA, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA, etc. are real PRESIDENTS, PRIME MINISTERS, etc.
@realDonaldTrump At stake in this election is whether we, the USA, will remain a DEMOCRACY or will become an AUTOCRACY. If DJT has his way, he will be our DICTATOR!  That‚Äôs what you want Donald, to RULE THE WORLD with YOUR despotic allies. SO SAD
@realDonaldTrump You are pitiful. To feel alone even though people are always around you. They are all USING YOU. You have LIED, LIED &amp; and LIED. You &amp; your children are making money off of the American Citizens. Just quit LYING. SO, SO SAD!!
@realDonaldTrump You will NEVER be good enough to LICK Pres. Obama‚Äôs shoes, be Sec. Clinton‚Äôs BUTLER. You are just a DOORMAT and we can‚Äôt wait to walk all over you and wipe our feet on you. NO ONE WILL EVER LOVE YOU AND YOU CAN‚ÄôT STAND IT. SAD
@realDonaldTrump Everyone knows why you talk so hateful about people. The people you insult are the people who EVERYONE LOVES. You want to be loved like the ones you insult, but YOU NEVER WILL BE LOVED BY ANYONE, maybe family. So, so sad.
@realDonaldTrump And you have done PUTIN‚ÄôS bidding since day 1. Everyone knows you are nothing, worth nothing. You are an empty shell. You are the LEADER of your Mob. The Democrats are not a MOB nor do we belong to a MOB. Everyone knows it too. So sad.
@realDonaldTrump You &amp; your people knew the ONLY way you could win 2016 was to CHEAT!  You got the RUSSIANS working for you or they asked you if they could help you. They hated Sec. Clinton, but you, they knew you would be PUTIN‚ÄôS PUPPET.
@realDonaldTrump You are a big fat LIAR. Not one word coming out of your mouth is a truth.   You are paying the ‚Äúcaravan‚Äù to come right before the election.  Everyone knows that. You STOLE the election 2016, you will NOT STEAL 2018.
