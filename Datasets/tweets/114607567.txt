.@kyfb gave me a Louisville Slugger this morning! http://t.co/WApXyqLsQW
Thank you @kyfb for honoring me with the Friend of Farm Bureau award. It’s an honor to represent Ky’s farm interests in Washington.
Americans can do anything. We can. And we will move forward in this Commonwealth &amp; Country to leave better world for next generation. @kyfb
Americans won't tolerate having China or any other country replacing us having the world's greatest economy.
We need to stop growing debt and start growing the economy and jobs to create opportunity for the next generation.
Tax reform, energy independence, stop out-of-control EPA, reform entitlements - pro growth agenda to leave better world for next generation.
It puts our country in a precarious situation when the legislative branch can't trust what laws the executive branch will or won't enforce.
The president &amp; I have kids the same age. What a great legacy to leave their generation if we stopped piling trillions in debt on them.
The avg KY farmer paid $150-thousand under old death tax...it took a fight in Congress to ensure you can pass your farm to next generation.
