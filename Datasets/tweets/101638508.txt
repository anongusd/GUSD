@immajustliedown @samstein 13 states (incl NY) don’t even have early voting. Unequal access to convenient in-person voting (not to mention blatantly racist attempts to purge entire communities from voter roll) extends to all states. Imagine how much worse lines will be in states WITHOUT early/mail voting
@immajustliedown @samstein I mean I agree its nice people are excited to vote. But enthusiasm doesn’t always translate into willingness or ability to spend 3 hours seeing it through. And resources conveniently get allocated so excited rich white suburban voters always manage to avoid enthusiasm pileups
@immajustliedown @samstein This isn’t waiting in line to buy the new iPhone. This is classic voter suppression targeting people of color, low income people, the elderly &amp;disabled to ensure they continue to be underrepresented/further marginalized. This logistical hurdle in this location is no accident
@immajustliedown @samstein And who are the people with the economic and social freedom to wait in line 3 hours to vote? The same people who are already in power, which they are wielding by systemically disenfranchising those who already face the greatest difficulties in getting to the polls.
@immajustliedown @samstein You’re assuming everyone has the same amount of free time &amp; flexibility in their schedule to wait in line for hours to do something that is already kind of a hassle for the average person, actively obstructed for many others, and most importantly is something that really matters.

@nuggrug Brown was 1of4 unarmed black men killed by police in a single month. 2 more examples in past week alone. I'd say it's an apt adverb
@nuggrug I'm saying crime stats dont justify shooting some1 dead. Being black is not a crime, nor does it pose inherent risk 2others' safety
