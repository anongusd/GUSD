A look back at day one of Stanford Medicine's #BigData in #PrecisionHealth conference. https://t.co/ffF2VwALgq #BigDataMed
Regina Dugan: I don’t normally do crystal ball predictions… The future is what we decide to build. #BigDataMed
Dean Lloyd Minor: Where do you think we will see the greatest impact of #tech on #healthcare in the next few years? #BigDataMed
Regina Dugan: Instead of doing curiosity-driven or applied research we looked for inflection points…which had a risk of failure. The idea of failing fast and often suggests a certain capriciousness about failure. Instead it’s balancing success and risk of failure. #BigDataMed
Dean Lloyd Minor: As we move to more complex problems with more data, how should our change our approach to problem solving? #BigDataMed
Regina Dugan: “Ajay Agrawal gave one of the simplest explanations of artificial intelligence, he said #AI significantly lowers the cost of prediction.” #BigDataMed
Regina Dugan continues: Just as a high tech race car needs a driver, health care data needs experts to compliment it. #BigDataMed
Regina Dugan: In 2017 the Singapore Grand Prix generated 10TB of data... Yet the driver still wins or loses the race. The driver must compliment state of the art #tech with judgment. Increasingly there are things we can predict, but there are still things we cannot. #BigDataMed
Regina Dugan shows a video of a race car at pit stop for a tire change. "Watch the video and see how painful 67 seconds feels." #BigDataMed
Regina Dugan: Data is so big we have to break time down to smaller and smaller segments just to understand it. Data is so big it’s as if we are starting to lose track of the feeling of a minute. #BigDataMed
Regina Dugan: When did data become big? It’s said that 90 percent of the world's data was created in the past 10 years. #BigDataMed

Dean Lloyd Minor: Immense amounts of information are at our fingertips, and we are developing exciting new ways to analyze it, to close the loop to deliver better health outcomes to our patients now. #BigDataMed
Dean Lloyd Minor: New data from sensors, wearables and apps is allowing us to predict and prevent disease like never before. #BigDataMed
Dean Lloyd Minor: “Another vast data mine comes from patients themselves. Through the use of innovative sensors, wearables, and apps, we can easily build huge datasets in ways that were unthinkable just a few years ago.” #BigDataMed
Dean Lloyd Minor: "Stanford’s Clinical Genomics Program now offers whole-exome sequencing, which can lead to diagnoses in 25 to 30 percent of the undiagnosed genetic diseases, offering some relief to children and their parents." #BigDataMed
Dean Lloyd Minor: With the sequencing of the human genome at the turn of the century, entire fields of study opened up. What seemed impossible then is nearly commonplace today. #BigDataMed
Dean Lloyd Minor: “This is the golden age of biomedicine. In just the last couple of decades we’ve seen truly astounding advances in basic research and in promising new therapies. So many of those breakthroughs can be credited to data.” #BigDataMed
Dean Lloyd Minor: This conference will build on the successes of past years as it sharpens its focus on # PrecisionHealth by delivering the power and potential of #BigData through a human-centered, high-tech, high-touch approach. #BigDataMed

Stephen Quake on publishing his genome in Nature: I created a way to sequence a genome, then sequenced my own. This sparked an interesting conversation on how would you treat a patient who walks into your office with their genome in hand. https://t.co/EgVyzE1xuv #StanfordChildx
Stephen Quake: Biopsies require that you have access to skilled physicians and people who can read the tests. Blood tests can be done anywhere and are easier to read. #StanfordChildx
Stephen Quake: Biopsies aren’t a perfect diagnostic. When two people look at the same biopsy the concordance rate is around 78 percent. #StanfordChildx
Stephen Quake: In 2011 and 2012 several clinical trials on thousands of women were published and commercial versions of the test were launched… .By 2016, about 3,000,000 women received the test and amniocentesis rates decreased by about 70 percent. #StanfordChildx https://t.co/mTQBm7fFx1

Dweck: The beliefs that adolescents have about themselves can play an important role in their health trajectories over time. Their mindset environments that people are in are of the utmost importance. #StanfordChildx
Dweck: People don’t do things because they are good or bad… . People are doing what they can to cope and they aren’t doing things to be mean. People can change. Learning this led to reduced reports of #depression in adolescents. #StanfordChildx
Dweck: The more you think personality is fixed, the more you think when you are rejected or excluded that you are not worthy, that you are a victim. This creates a tornado of hate and shame. #StanfordChildx https://t.co/Dafvy1HeOv
Dweck: In the end, the growth mindset will come to fruition by creating cultures of growth mindset that will help teachers foster it at schools. #StanfordChildx
Dweck: How can we encourage this? Often adolescents are preached at and are told what to do. Instead we said, “We are scientists, but you are the experts on the high school experience. We need your help to make learning better.” #StanfordChildx https://t.co/MxOXoRdM1j
