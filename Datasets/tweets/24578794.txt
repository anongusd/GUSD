Oh it’s a compliment. But it happens to be poison for the hater. It is a bitter cup. https://t.co/nosEtjivzs
Bill it’s virtue signaling. Even though she is misinformed being on her side implies you care about the world and others. And you aren’t Neanderthals like us. @potus has street smarts and is winning concessions politicians wouldn’t rock the boat for. Thus the snickers. . . https://t.co/x2lYhUYZw7

My thoughts on @POTUS’ controversial decision to pull out of Syria https://t.co/rNCIx9fLQZ
So far we’ve spent $6 trillion and sacrificed 7,000+ American lives in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria. To what end? Makes sense to scale back troop presence selectively and devote more resources to rebuilding our country.
I’ve been to Iraq + Afghanistan with @BENS_org. Learned 1) American troops provide valuable stability 2) many problems are intractable. @POTUS made call human + economic costs of staying in Syria outweigh benefits. He has good instincts and deserves chance to see strategy through
I often wonder: what would the policies and rhetoric look like if there was a universal military draft and shared burden of sacrifice across the socioeconomic strata in our country?

@JakeSherman @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump didn't say it was fake, said it felt planted/timing was suspect. Just as Acosta mentioned as possible AG, this story comes out.

Fitting that Senator McCain would pass 9 years to the day since his dear friend Senator Ted Kennedy. Their fierce patriotism and mutual respect, despite ideological differences, embodies the Washington we have lost and must regain. True American statesmen.
“I want to urge Americans, for as long as I can, to remember that this shared devotion to human rights is our truest heritage and our most important loyalty.” 		Well said, @SenJohnMcCain. May we do our best to live by your example. RIP

Isolating and confronting China is correct strategy, but would be more effective tactic to dial back bellicosity in negotiations with our allies. Ultimately I think @POTUS will make great deals on NAFTA/EU and pressure China into grand bargain. https://t.co/haov9uq1YY
Chinese intellectuals are awed by @POTUS skill as strategist and tactician. While his outreach to Russia and North Korea is met (hypocritically) with derision at home, Beijing understands it correctly as means to isolate them. History shows China will only respond to strength.

@FT @FinancialTimes @POTUS Not only is trade war reckless economic policy, it's bad personal politics. If this keeps up, heartland America is going to take a hit in wallet and midterms are going to be a disaster for GOP.
@FT @FinancialTimes @POTUS .@POTUS is right that American leadership before him (starting in late 90s) largely responsible for current situation by not confronting China earlier on trade abuses. His diagnosis is correct, it's the treatment plan that needs refining. Give allied leaders room to make deals.
@FT @FinancialTimes @POTUS U.S. trade imbalances with Europe are largely down to divergent approaches to taxation. Every developed country in world (+160 others) has some form of VAT, which acts like tariff. Need to either reform our tax code to incorporate DBCFT or negotiate fair way to even things out.
@FT @FinancialTimes @POTUS Because China is centrally-planned economy and President Xi has unlimited political capital, government has tools to weather storm in trade war.
@FT @FinancialTimes @POTUS Since joining WTO in 2001, China has violated rules with currency devaluation, IP theft, inadequate labour standards, illegal subsidies, steel dumping. Should be held accountable, but tariffs aren't way to do it. Applying pressure through global alliances offers best hope.
FDR slowed down the assault in Europe until he could figure out the Pacific. We all want @potus to succeed. Saying the truth only helps that. https://t.co/VWba3nzk3b
@FT @FinancialTimes During his first 16 months in office, @POTUS made all right moves in terms of the economy and markets, but escalating trade war risks undoing much of that. Blue collar voters who propelled him to Presidency suffer the most from tariffs.
@FT @FinancialTimes WTO, like NATO, might be imperfect but is crucial for American and global growth. Without it we would have a race toward protectionism, which would produce suboptimal outcome for everyone. Best way to even out trade imbalances is through more coordination, not less.
The U.S. should be building a coalition to confront China's brazen trade abuses, not antagonizing all of our allies with self-destructive tariffs and bellicose rhetoric. You don't win wars fighting on multiple fronts.

Party in power always has the greatest opportunity to change the political process for the better. I truly believe the side that breaks the poisonous cycle by reaching across the aisle when they don’t have to will end up being rewarded by voters.
Congress now routinely votes on bills that nobody has read and obstructs SCOTUS nominees who are supremely qualified. Americans are hungry for a more reasonable approach to politics.
Pendulum of power will always swing back and forth between Democrats and Republicans, and each side can always point to something the other did in the past as justification for bad faith governance. But at some point we need our leaders to be statesmen and stop the vicious cycle.
For those saying it’s convenient for me to make the point on Judges Garland/Kavanaugh now, I also called out hypocrisy of GOP establishment at the time. https://t.co/As1J85C9yC
I didn’t like how Republicans treated Judge Merrick Garland, and I think it would be a mistake for Democrats to blindly obstruct on Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Both are extremely talented jurists and thoughtful scholars. SCOTUS should not be subject to partisan games.

@PhilippeReines @MichaelAvenatti It’s not a veiled shot. I tweeted yesterday and said on CNN this morning that John Kelly was driving force behind family separation policy while at DHS. He told @NPR earlier this year that it was a powerful deterrent and that kids would be okay in “foster care or whatever”
@MichaelAvenatti @TheDemocrats @POTUS We’ll see. He just got back from the historic summit in Singapore. His attention is starting to shift to this issue. I’m hoping with more examination he sees that it’s bad policy and puts an end to it.
You can’t simultaneously argue that family separation isn’t happening, that it’s being used as a deterrent, that the Bible justifies it and that it’s @TheDemocrats fault. @POTUS is not being served well by his advisors on this issue.
@azarilaw @POTUS I agree. There were no strings attached to my first statement.

Both things can be true: 1) separating children from their parents at border is inhumane and WH should end policy now 2) Congress should urgently pass bipartisan immigration reform dealing with DACA, border security and enforcement. Enough with political games - on both sides.

This is a Wollman Rink moment for @POTUS: don’t listen to governmental advisers or positional politicians step like the CEO that you are and fix the problem.
On Fathers Day we shouldn’t be seen as a country that separates it’s parents from their children. Just isn’t right and we have better values than that. But our divided government is actually a disaster.
Congress are direct representatives of the people and should pass laws to govern immigration enforcement. But the reality is @TheDemocrats don’t want comprehensive agreement on immigration so they can politically weaponize the issue in midterms.
.@POTUS didn’t invent the child separation policy - his Chief of Staf/fmr DHS secretary did. Kelly told @NPR “the children will be taken care of - put into foster care or whatever.” That is not a humane solution. Expect the situation to be rectified. https://t.co/yypP5rIKfD

False. Can never blame a man for doing what he thinks is right, even if you disagree with him. https://t.co/XxE5P5rVWd
Not at all. The remark was wrong. The leak was wrong. But only one was calculated, dishonest and malicious. https://t.co/mWsKtP9Ggp
Of course what Kelly said was wrong and regrettable. She acknowledged that and apologized in private. WH should’ve signed off on public apology, too. John McCain is a true American hero, period. As honorable and resilient as they come. I’m praying for the senator. https://t.co/16L4qHyVcG
I respect the cause and the right to peaceful protest, but don’t agree with the method or the venue. Kneelers have, intentionally or not, politicized the anthem 🎶, the flag 🇺🇸, and the NFL 🏈. 70% of Americans think they should stand. @CNN @ChrisCuomo https://t.co/uZjxFxRXFt
Thanks Jack. That wasn’t the point though. https://t.co/Ztu2ELBUL5
A public apology would have sufficed. For some reason they decided not to do that. https://t.co/1IILg6hJIr
Wrong venue. Most paid employee peacefully protest during their free time. https://t.co/5Qw7z8sCJP
Kelly Sadler is a world-class person who made a flippant off-hand remark in private. But instead of handling internally or attaching name to criticism, someone who wanted her fired leaked anonymously to press. This behavior is why people hate Washington. https://t.co/hUdcTG51qO
I recognize the problem and appreciate and respect the protest. My only issue is venue. We need to make society better— good enough so no one wants to kneel. https://t.co/RlaRqdUAAT
