I want to compliment @realDonaldTrump for being bold and brave! We’ve been in Afghanistan for far too long! Let’s stop spending money there and start spending it here at home.
The war caucus, Republican and Democrat, agree on one thing – American soldiers must not come home – EVER!
Apparently, these warmongers believe you can’t come home quickly or slowly.
So, supporters of forever war have defined coming home after 17 years as too precipitous and condemned a planned withdrawal as too deliberate.
These same supporters of forever war argue that if we set a timetable for coming home that we are telegraphing to the enemy our plans and our actions are too deliberate.
Finally, after 17 years, we have a President bold enough to declare victory and bring our troops home and the warmongers have the gall to claim that coming home, after 17 years, is precipitous?
Precipitously? How laughable and ludicrous is that description. How could anyone with a straight face argue that declaring victory and coming home after nearly two decades is precipitous.

⚡️ “Senator Rand Paul's 2018 #Festivus Tweetstorm”		https://t.co/Qi6KQ4sxWd
So everyone enjoy your feats of strength today. Air your grievances here or in your home.  But remember, thanks to Donald Trump we are ALL saying Merry Christmas this year — so repeat after me: MERRY CHRISTMAS and HAPPY HOLIDAYS to everyone even the haters and losers.
All kidding aside, they were important, bipartisan reforms that show how Washington CAN work if people from both sides of the aisle get together on things that make sense. I’m proud to have been a part of both.
But then we exchanged some thoughts about bipartisan reforms we could work on, like hemp legalization and criminal justice reforms. Well, it’s a Festivus miracle because Congress passed and the President signed BOTH of those things this week.
I’m going to close today by talking about something good that has happened. In fact, some could even say it has its beginnings right here on #Festivus twitter a few years ago. I poked a little fun at my friend Corey Booker.
I hear they’re piping this into his office now for the entire Christmas season. .https://t.co/KLPpLHavSy
I opposed John Bolton being hired. But I really can’t think of anything that makes me happier then thinking of him having to end wars for the rest of his time in the White House.
Well, actually…let’s talk about John Bolton. I don’t have a grievance. I just really would have liked to have been in the room when the POTUS told him to END a war. How many times do you think he made the President repeat it because he didn’t even know what the words meant?
I’m going to go a bit easier on the grievances against the neocons and warmongers this year though.  The Weekly Standard has folded, wars are ending — I really think their holiday is already bad enough, I don’t want to pile on.
Many of these people hold these two views: 1 - that it was horrible to leave the war in Syria and 2 - that it is horrible that General Mattis left, since he was what kept the President from starting WWIII or something. I don’t understand how you hold both of those views.
Grievance against the foreign policy establishment of both parties in DC:
Lindsay and I were on the same side on foreign policy for about 5 minutes a few weeks ago, regarding the Saudis. He said it was a sign of “end times”.  I guess we are all gonna live a bit longer after all.
I have to tell you; I haven’t seen a Senator who loves war this much since the Star Wars Prequels. https://t.co/UFU242XYQK
My friend Lindsay Graham is a bit mad right now. You see, he’s never seen a war end before. He’s going to have to console himself with the fact that we still are in about 8 more. I know it will be hard for him, but I think he’ll get by.
Ted really should have grown that beard before he ran for President. He looks less Canadian now.
Congress has now decided to shut down the government because they aren’t spending enough money. I got suspicious when Ted Cruz came back from Thanksgiving break with that beard. https://t.co/y0r3dpFbbG
So moving down the road to Congress.  Oh, Congress. Every year it seems things get more absurd. They were so bad this week they made my friend Mike Lee say “doggone”.  It was nuts.
It will be quite lovely really. And It was on sale for $99, so we can open the government back up now.
I did something to help the President out though. I found him a wall I think will work on the border. https://t.co/gx7ejwn1RU
And folks, that is NOT who you want in charge of your Middle East peace plans.
Speaking of criminal justice reform, I have to give Jared Kushner credit. He was great on this. And I’m glad I got to know him, because before that I was a bit suspicious he was the kid from the Omen movie all grown up.
People are saying that with the recent passage of criminal justice reform, and coming home from wars, that I have a lot of influence on the President. It is true I’m on the phone with him a good amount. But I have to tell you, I haven’t gotten a word in on him in over a year.
Mick is a good friend of mine, in fact a lot of people probably don’t remember he was the national co-chair for my Presidential campaign. Uh oh, probably just got him fired. https://t.co/3jH3ZsZh8r

This is actually my grievance with liberals. They want the government to do more and more, take over more healthcare, more education — I mean you seen what it ALREADY is doing?
Speaking of which, buried in the foreign aid reports last year, I discovered something — we give foreign aid to China. So government is so dumb, it is literally borrowing money from China, to give it back to China, while paying interest on it.
So of course, instead of fixing waste like this and reforming government, the geniuses in Congress decided to have a fight over how much MORE money they were going to “spend” aka borrow from China.

Here’s The Libertarian Case For Brett Kavanaugh’s Nomination https://t.co/GAdhmBMHf0
Finally, his strong defenses of the First and Second Amendments in landmark cases show someone who isn’t afraid to challenge the status quo and will fight with backbone. Judge Kavanaugh will have my support and my vote to confirm him to the Supreme Court.
His views on due process and mens rea show a thoughtful approach to the law and its applications. His views on war powers and separation of powers are encouraging.
On issues such as property rights and reining in the administrative state, Judge Kavanaugh has a strong record and showed a deep commitment during our meeting.
My conversation with Judge Kavanaugh reinforces my belief that he will evaluate cases before the Supreme Court from a textual and originalist point of view. I believe he will carefully adhere to the Constitution and will take his job to protect individual liberty seriously.
Of course, my vote is not a single-issue vote, and much of my reading and conversation has been in trying to figure out exactly how good Judge Kavanaugh will be on other issues before the Court.
In reviewing his record on other privacy cases like Jones, and through my conversation with him, I have hope that in light of the new precedent in Carpenter v. United States, Judge Kavanaugh will be more open to a Fourth Amendment that protects digital records and property.
I have expressed my concern over Judge Kavanaugh’s record on warrantless bulk collection of data and how that might apply to very important privacy cases before the Supreme Court.
After meeting Judge Kavanaugh and reviewing his record, I have decided to support his nomination. No one will ever completely agree with a nominee (unless of course, you are the nominee). Each nominee however, must be judged on the totality of their views character and opinions.

Just got out of WH meeting with @realDonaldTrump. I restated to him what I have said in public: John Brennan and others partisans should have their security clearances revoked.
Today I will meet with the President and I will ask him to revoke John Brennan’s security clearance!
Is John Brennan monetizing his security clearance?  Is John Brennan making millions of dollars divulging secrets to the mainstream media with his attacks on @realDonaldTrump ?
This week I defended the President’s foreign policy against the establishment of both parties. Looks like I was rewarded with a left-wing attack about overseas spending. Truth is - I am the only Senator who has never traveled overseas at taxpayer expense.

Spending and waste is out of control. How moronic are we to keep flushing tax payer money down a rathole in Afghanistan? When republicans become the majority there is no conservative party. What I'm asking for today is to cut one penny from every dollar in spending.

Does anyone in America think the government can't do with 1% less? If the government ran a balanced budget we would have a stronger, safer nation. If we want to secure our nation we need to make sure we have a sound economy.
Republicans say we are for devolving spending and limited government and yet why won't they vote for a budget that balances? I've put forward a Penny Plan budget that cuts spending by 1%. Couldn't we cut one penny from every dollar? Isn't there enough government waste to cut?
The budget that republicans passed last year had entitlement reform. Did they do anything to enact those reforms? No. No one lifted a finger to do anything about entitlement spending. It's a canard.
When we have a vote on my balanced budget in a minute we'll see republicans saying oh my we can't cut spending. They're only for spending restraint in theory.
Dems and Republicans make an unholy alliance. Republicans get more military spending and dems get more welfare spending. We've got guns and butter everyone gets what they want but the tax payer.
There is a point which debt is too cumbersome...We have a national debt of $21 trillion dollars. Currently the debt ceiling has been raised and the government can spend and borrow as much as they want.
Right now, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY), chairman of the Federal Spending Oversight and Emergency Management (FSO) Subcommittee, is speaking on the U.S. Senate floor to urge support for his “Penny Plan” balanced budget: https://t.co/9GEF7frVHp
Your Senator should be voting to balance the budget! This is a way to do it!

I shared 600 pages tonight. I’m done tweeting them for the evening. If they insist on voting, I will vote no because it spends to much and there’s just too little time to read the bill and let everyone know what’s actually in it. 		Thanks for sticking with me.
Page 594 sec 626: No $ to require disclosure of content of an electronic communication. 		Good amendment here. It would be to also protect forced disclosure of metadata, ie phone #’s and identities of the phone callers.
Page 587:		No $ for the President to request FBI background report on any individual. 		If we had amendments, this would be a good place to add no $ for partisan hacks in the Intel community to unmask any American without a judicial warrant.
Page 580:		Post Office gets $58 million but only if it promises not to close down small, underutilized, money-losing post offices.
General Services Administration database of properties for sale is not available to  public, Congress or other federal agencies.		Govt Acctbility Office says govt continues to hold more property than it needs.		No matter. . .this year the big spenders still give GSA big $

But Brennan and Clapper too busy spewing hatred of Trump to respond to legitimate requests.
on page 355.  NSA prohibited from targeting US persons with FISA 702 program. 		sounds good —but — privacy advocates fear that NSA still does back-door targeting of US persons. 		Courageous Senator Wyden has asked how many US persons caught up in supposedly foreign data base.

President Trump sought to break with the foreign policy mistakes of the last two administrations. Yet now he picks for Secretary of State and CIA Director people who embody them, defend them, and, I’m afraid, will repeat them. I will not support their nominations.
I will continue to support President @realDonaldTrump, but I can’t support people who never understood America First and want to manipulate the President into the sphere of the neocons who never met a war they didn’t want to star in.
Director Pompeo has not learned the lessons of regime change and wants regime change in Iran.
What I liked about candidate Trump was his strong condemnation of the Iraq War. I believe President Trump has done a great job, and I continue to support him, but I cannot endorse his nomination of people who loved the Iraq War so much that they want an Iran War next.

Kelley and I wish a Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to all.
To everyone, thanks for checking in here today for my annual #AiringofGrievances.  This is always fun, but in all seriousness #HappyFestivus
You can read more of the report here https://t.co/qAxQT2hrRu‘festivus’-edition-‘-waste-report’
Those are just a few items from our #HappyFestivus edition of the waste report, and they add to our #AiringofGrievances.
Last but definitely worst: your government thought It wise to spend your tax dollars to build $255 million to repair roads...in Afghanistan https://t.co/aKFzUSEbYG
And @realDonaldTrump thinks there is a chance in hell someone else is going to pay for that border wall. https://t.co/aL88gcPEjF
We spent $15 million to train cashiers in Walmart...in Mexico
That begs several queastions really. Like why we blew up the last Libyan government...and, wait, there’s a Libyan government currently?
We spent $8.2 million to “instill confidence in the Libyan government”.
Oh great, now the waste report is going to get a subpoena from the Special Prosecutor.
We spent over $170k to build trails in national parks. Seems like not too bad until you read the next line that the parks were in Russia
It may not seem like a lot of money, but we spent just under $100k to make sure Kenyan farmers knew how to use Facebook.
They spent $324,015 to pay for a clown school in Argentina. Rumors to the contrary, this was not a CODEL
Your government spent $3,217,960 on putting on music festival and concerts abroad.
Here are just a handful of the examples...#AiringofGrievances
That’s roughly the size of my hometown of Bowling Green, Kentucky
The average taxpayer pays around $8,136. That means the programs in this report wasted the taxes of 69,250 people
My #Festivus edition of the Waste Report totals $563,421,523 the federal government wasted.
I’m back to celebrate #Festivus with some more #AiringofGrievances, this time about how the government spends your money

This will help ensure House acceptance of the Senate plan as leaders there have stated they will not accept a plan with no state and local deductibility. Repeal the mandate fix problems with Senate bill through more tax cuts for all and help ensure House and Senate plans agree.
My amendment will fix a problem in the Senate bill where many taxpayers would see a tax increase because of the loss of state and local deductions.		I will introduce a similar deduction as the House plan, making the tax reform plan more fair for everyone.
Today I am announcing my intention to amend the Senate tax bill to repeal the individual mandate and provide bigger tax cuts for middle income taxpayers.		The mandate repeal is a promise we all made and we should keep. It also allows an additional $300 billion+ in tax cuts.

The Senate fell one vote short tonight, which is disappointing. I intend to keep fighting for repeal.
This week, I voted multiple times to repeal Obamacare, including offering my own clean repeal bill.
5. Expand HSA (larger maximum contributions)	6.  Push and fund expansion of 1332 waivers for states to opt out of many regulations
3. Repeal 3 years of medical device tax 	4.  Defund Planned Parenthood for 1 year
The next healthcare vote will be soon. The bill will: 	1. Repeal Individual Mandate tax/penalty	2. Repeal the job killing Employer mandate
Just voted YES on the Heller Amdt. to permanently repeal the burdensome "Cadillac" tax on health insurance plans
830 vote is to repeal the Cadillac tax, an Obamacare tax that increases costs of insurance &amp; costs job creators and workers billions.

Today we took the first steps to repeal Obamacare. Here's my statement after today's #healthcare vote. https://t.co/ph3VqcYAtv
@SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump If this is indeed the plan, I will vote to proceed and I will vote for any all measures that are clean repeal.
@SenateMajLdr Repealing mandates &amp; taxes, without new spending and bailouts. This is the path I've been urging, and what I discussed with @realDonaldTrump
@SenateMajLdr If we cannot pass full, clean 2015 repeal, I've also been told we will vote on whatever version of CLEAN repeal we can pass.
@SenateMajLdr I've been told by leadership their bill would now need 60 votes to pass, votes they do not have. Therefore I believe it will fail.
@SenateMajLdr If that is the plan, I will vote to proceed to have this vote. I also now believe we will be able to defeat the new spending and bailouts.
This morning, @SenateMajLdr informed me that the plan for today is to take up the 2015 clean repeal bill as I've urged.

I don't think we should sell arms to Saudi Arabia if it might wind up in the hands of ISIS and if they punish people for protests... https://t.co/JP1VV1zWRz
Today we will discuss an arms sale to Saudi Arabia that threatens the lives of millions of Yemenis... https://t.co/aX56BIvg6Q
A year ago the Senate voted to let 9/11 victims sue Saudi Arabia. Now we are going to sell them weapons? What are we thinking?
There is an abundance of evidence that high level Saudis were complicit in 9/11. The 28 pages show that. Why would we give them arms?
Today we discuss issues of war and peace. https://t.co/ZScXseQEum
We should be attempting to end the aquisition of ballistic missiles from both Iran and Saudi Arabia not fueling an arms race.
Even @HillaryClinton when she is speaking honestly in emails, noted the Saudis have supported terrorism. Why would we give them anything?
And we are going to give them weapons? I say no.
We must stand up and tell Saudi Arabia ENOUGH. They are the biggest exporter of extremism and hatred in the world.
We can't fix every problem in the world. But today we can vote to not make one huge crisis worse.
17 million live in edge of starvation. Crisis may well be worse than Syria. And our country is going to further arm one side of this war
What can we do to help all those dying in Yemen? This is a huge humanitarian crisis. Children are dying from war and blockages by Saudis
They can't avoid the vote today. I forced it through a privileged motion. So let's talk about whether or not to arm Saudi Arabia
Today we will discuss issues of war &amp; peace, which we rarely do. We have been in conflict over 15 years.
Saudi Arabia is causing a humanitarian crisis with a war in Yemen. It funds extremism worldwide. Abuses human rights. Stop arming them now.
The vote will be close.  It is time we stop the counterproductive and harmful practice of arming a country that promotes extremism

And it keeps insurance company subsidies forever.
It keeps individual mandate but makes you pay the insurance companies instead of the government
Their plan keeps the Obamacare "Cadillac Tax" forever, which is a tax on the best health insurance.
It keeps Obamacare subsidies but renames them "refundable credits."
House Obamacare Lite plan keeps Obamacare taxes for another year
The House leadership Obamacare Lite plan has many problems. We should be stopping mandates, taxes and entitlements not keeping them.
Th House leadership plan is Obamacare Lite. It will not pass. Conservarives are not going to take it.  #FullRepeal

@RandPaul I demand the House release the text of the bill. Every elected official &amp; every American deserve to know what they're trying to do
@RandPaul House and Senate passed repeal in 2015. They should keep their promises and bring them up again for a vote now
@RandPaul Renaming and keeping parts of Obamacare, new entitlements and extending medicaid expansion are not the #FullRepeal we promised
@RandPaul What is the House leadership trying to hide? My guess is, they are trying to hide their "Obamacare Lite" approach.
@RandPaul This is unacceptable. This is the biggest issue before Congress and the American people right now.

What's NOT a joke is wasteful spending &amp; the fact that I wish you all a Merry Christmas &amp; Happy Holidays. Hope you enjoyed Festivus w/ me.
For the folks at @MSNBC, that was a joke.
I'm gonna have to stop tweeting about Festivus soon, @FoxNews just asked me to come on &amp; talk about my own personal #WaronChristmas. Rude.
But I'm upset VP &amp; cabinet wasn't picked w/ a reality show. I would have watched. You would have too, don't deny it. #AiringofGrievances
My other colleagues @SenMikeLee &amp; @SenTedCruz are rumored to be on the Supreme court short list. @survivorcbs is gonna be so nerdy this year
On a positive note, since that exchange @CoryBooker &amp; I have worked on many criminal justice bills, proving Festivus brings us all together.
A few years ago I complained that my colleague @CoryBooker didn't retweet me enough. Apparently he can't take a hint. #AiringofGrievances
I was gonna pick Mitch, but every time I tried to bring it up the Capitol Police kept getting twitchy. Sorry guys.
I decided I'd take on someone who thought he was a tough guy. Bring it, @SenatorReid #featsofstrength https://t.co/RzwWeLnXPx
If you only celebrate Festivus, enjoy today and I hope you win the feats of strength later. I've been practicing...

Of course here in our own office my adviser @dougstafford thinks the @nyjets are real too. I can't convince him or Woody otherwise...
Also, for those who think @WWE is real, I'm very sorry Bernie Sanders lost.
I'm very sorry to have been the one to tell @jackhunter74 pro wrestling is not real in that last tweet.
Speaking of fake drama, this administration is the first to include 2 @WWE hall of famers. My grievance is, why isn't Mean Gene press sec?

Today marks, not the end of the battle but the beginning of a long Constitutional struggle... https://t.co/A1OVR4dDED
RT @TheNatlInterest: Why @RandPaul and @ChrisMurphyCT want to block a U.S. arms sale to Saudi Arabia: https://t.co/dVl17Arnm9 https://t.co/…
We must send a message right now, today to Saudi Arabia: Stop putting Christians to death, stop beheading protesters, stop the abuse.
Or will the #ClintonCash secure the Saudis more favors and a blind eye to their terror financing and human rights abuses?
I can't be silent about Obama's Saudi arms deals. What will Hillary Clinton do? Will she stand up &amp; oppose selling weapons to Saudi Arabia?
Stop fueling a Middle East arms race and worsening an already horrific refugee crisis in Yemen.
Stop ignoring the cost of war and the innocent lives lost.
Stop arming countries who participate in financing terrorists and Islamic extremists around the world.
I'm standing up today to say no more. Stop. Stop arming nations that abuse their citizens and human rights.
Now Obama wants another $1.15 billion dollar arms deal with Saudi Arabia because apparently his $100 billion in arms deals weren't enough.
Hillary Clinton looked the other way to the Saudi war on women and their terror financing because they bought her off.
Keep in mind this is also a country that recently bombed a hospital and school and consistently oppresses and violates the rights of women.
In fact, Hillary Clinton's foundation has even taken $10-25 million from the Saudi regime and millions from a Saudi prince.
This was known to both president Obama and Hillary Clinton. But they continue to treat Saudi Arabia as a trusted ally.
Citizens and officials of one of our so called allies, Saudi Arabia, were involved in the financing of terror including 9/11.
I fought hard to have the 28 pages of the 9/11 report made public so Americans could know the truth.
By continuing to arm Saudi Arabia the Obama Administration ignores horrific human rights abuses and duplicitous actions by the Saudi regime.
A vote on selling arms to Saudi Arabia is a proxy vote on whether or not there should be unending war in the Middle East.
Today we didn't just debate Obama's $1.15 billion Saudi arms deal, we debated constitutional principles and war.

This is a loss for the rule of law and further degrades Americans' faith in the justice system.
Today Comey &amp; Obama's DOJ made it clear to the American people there's no accountability no justice &amp; the Clintons live by different rules.
The appearance is terrible. The decision is astounding. Ppl have gone to jail for less severe classified breaches and national security.
Three days later the FBI director announces no charges are being brought against Hillary Clinton.
This weekend, we learned former President Clinton met with the Obama Administration Attorney general - the FBI director's boss - in private.
The FBI then announced she would face no charges. This is an outrage and the rule of law has been turned upside down.
Today the FBI announced @HillaryClinton violated classified procedures and recklessly endangered national security - over 100 times...
It's going down, I'm yelling timber! Got to chop down a big tree on #IndependenceDay. Hope everyone had a good one. https://t.co/LKsFw5Pt5h
But mostly, today I hope you'll celebrate our country, which remains the greatest, best and last hope for freedom. Fight for it every day.
Thanks to everyone who followed along today. I hope you'll read a few of my suggestions and crank up up a few of the songs.
Closing out the 4th with a little known song an icon who was taken from us this year, too soon: Prince, "America" https://t.co/YtJ7vulBLY
A beautifully written song about how freedom needs to be for everyone, not just the powerful. Chimes of Freedom: https://t.co/12hJPywgOM
From the great scholar Lord Acton to read on #IndependenceDay, Essays on Freedom and Power https://t.co/118d04ozHX

There's a lot of patriotic music out there and that's great, because we should all celebrate our country and our freedom on #IndependenceDay
May not be everyone's idea of beach reading but something from a modern historian on that time #IndependenceDay https://t.co/Xr3x7eXA4R
Let's move on now to the author, as he wished to be remembered, with Jefferson's autobiography: https://t.co/tZgZEKRHhM
So let's start with something simple but important, and re-read the Declaration of Independence:  https://t.co/hTtcVdtlqu
Freedom is something we must fight for and be vigilant to protect. 240 years ago a document was signed that made the case for Freedom.
I thought I'd join everyone celebrating #IndependenceDay with some thoughts, words and music. Happy 4th of July!
