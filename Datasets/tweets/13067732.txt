@StormyDaniels Article is from 2016 FYI
On the one hand, 193 votes on the Goodlatte immigration bill gives conservatives reason to think leaders could/should have pushed harder to pass it. On the other hand, leaders view that as a high ceiling. Unclear what changes could‚Äôve moved the needle more.
One bill that is NOT on the table: Mark Meadows‚Äô standalone family separation/asylum reform bill. Leaders and members are fed up with his posture during these negotiations and are not eager to give him a win
They are looking to release text as soon as tomorrow and could potentially vote in the first half of next week. Members are heading into a private meeting right now to discuss the compromise bill.

@dcbigjohn The bill would end family separation, but also get rid of a rule limiting how long children can be held, thus allowing em to be held indefinitely with parents. Is holding families for weeks/months/years a better solution than separating children?
Moderate House Republicans acknowledged this morning their bill could allow for INDEFINITE DETENTION of children with their families at the border. Say they‚Äôd like Senate or companion legislation to fix but realize it‚Äôs prob too late to change the House bill now.	cc: @dcbigjohn

Farm bill FAILS
Goodlatte said leadership has committed to bring his bill to the floor, but it will not be the original version. Expects changes to get it over the finish line.
Freedom Caucus member Scott DesJarlais says he‚Äôll vote for farm hill bc he‚Äôs on Ag Cmte, but understands why his HFC colleagues are using it for leverage. Said there‚Äôs a commitment from leadership to bring up Goodlatte bill before June 8 or so

Of course, leaders hold that they never promised a vote, only promised they would whip the Goodlatte bill. Either way, HFC doesn‚Äôt think they pushed it hard enough.
As of right now, both freedom caucus and leadership sources say there is no deal. The farm bill is vote is scheduled to start in about an hour. https://t.co/aRda1gsQQh
Here‚Äôs the problem for House GOP leaders: Freedom Caucus says they were promised a vote on a hardline immigration bill in exchange for approving a CR months ago. That vote never happened. So they‚Äôre wary of another vague promise in exchange for farm bill votes.

Thanks all for reading and for your comments. I didn‚Äôt realize how common these ‚ÄúHell Houses‚Äù are. Jews don‚Äôt prosthelytize so the idea of someone actually trying to trick you into joining their religion was then and still is baffling to me.
@Will32283 Yep! Great guy. I remember him fondly.
Interesting. This was in Pasadena, TX. The one I went to was in the parking lot of Hagee‚Äôs Cornerstone Church in NW San Antonio. Sounds exactly the same though. I don‚Äôt remember the AIDS or suicide parts though... https://t.co/RYtG1zifIS
@AndreWaters20 @Will32283 please please, send me a link to the documentary if you can find it
@AndreWaters20 @Will32283 thank you! I googled so many iterations of things like that and couldn‚Äôt come up with it.
sorry - preacher not preached and fake not make. trying to get this all out quickly as i remember it.
Also, the rabbi who led the synagogue I used to belong to controversially partnered with Hagee to send Jews to Israel. They both shared the view that when all Jews had visited, the Messiah would come. Different Messiah‚Äôs though, a minor thing, really.
Anyway, I couldn‚Äôt help thinking of this story as John Hagee spoke at the the opening of the embassy in Jerusalem.
I didn‚Äôt participate, but I remember another friend, also tricked into this, who grew up in a religious family but himself was not, did. He left in tears. This was scarier than any haunted house I‚Äôve ever been to. I don‚Äôt know if they still put these on, but I hope not.
Finally, the preached finished his spiel so they opened the door, which was actually more of a make plastic rock. Sorry, I should have mentioned that room was done up to look like a cave. On the other side were one-on-one counseling sessions. It was all very manipulative.
At this point there were actual ushers, not  horror creatures. So I politely asked to leave, telling them I was Jewish and I don‚Äôt want to be part of this. They wouldn‚Äôt let me.
After a bit, the other side opened into a room with a live actor pretending to be Jesus, bloody and writhing on a cross. A young preacher came in and told us all about how he used to do cocaine and weed etc before he found the way.
There were several other skits I can‚Äôt remember. Finally we were led to a room with a grim reaper walking around &amp; several standing coffins. We were told it was the end &amp; we had to make a decision &amp; were led one by one into the coffins. They closed the doors.
In the next scene, the teen, now pregnant, turned to abortion. We were led through the funhouse maze to a doctor‚Äôs office where an actor pretended to perform a gruesome bloody procedure after which he threw the aborted fetus at us. He literally threw it, in a hospital kidney dish
Actors enacted out scenes in front of us of teens making bad life decisions. In one skit, a girl smoked weed at a house party, passed out on a couch and was promptly date raped.
I grew up in San Antonio. John Hagee‚Äôs church was just down the road. In high school, an acquaintance, who knew I was Jewish, lured me to Cornerstone‚Äôs scare-you-Christian haunted house by telling me it was a an ordinary Halloween funhouse. It was terrible.

DEFENSE HAWKS: Want full year defense spending and to send a message to leaders that stopgap military funding is unacceptable. Not as monolithic or organized as Freedom Caucus but do they stick together and force a shutdown to make that point?
CONSERVATIVES: Want full-year defense funding &amp; maybe a vote on Goodlatte immigration bill. Helped GOP leaders pass a CR in Dec in a rare show of unity, but their leverage lies in dissent so they can‚Äôt seem too eager to help again.
DEMOCRATS: Refuse to vote for CR without DACA fix, or CHIP without Medicare extenders &amp; community health centers, or so Pelosi says.	The test is whether they can stick together. Pelosi says unity is strength. But if conservative Dems peel off, her leverage will be hurt

Updated w comment from Booker‚Äôs staff, here is the strange story of the woman who arrived for a meeting with the Senator‚Äôs staff with an unlicensed handgun and ammunition https://t.co/yyvEDpcqgQ
Giertz further comments that Rivers did in fact have a meeting scheduled with Booker‚Äôs staff
But again, in my interview with Rivers she said she did not have any set meetings and intended to go door to door showing senators her healthcare product
That detail comes from a DC Superior Court document which states: ‚ÄúOn Tuesday, December 19, 2017, [Rivers] emailed Senator Cory Booker‚Äôs office requesting a meeting with Booker regarding her healthcare technology. A meeting was set with [Rivers] for Wednesday December 20..."
UPDATE: Jeff Giertz, spokesman for Sen. Booker, says in an email Rivers did not have a meeting scheduled with the Senator.
Whose button is bigger? https://t.co/xwrLitEkoz
Booker‚Äôs office has not responded to my request for comment. I will update this thread as necessary.
In 2011, Gary Ray, a homeless man, was sentenced to 15 years after pleading guilty to attempted sexual battery for the assault on Rivers.
Her story was told at the time in local news accounts such as this one: https://t.co/BMvJvVm7Oo and subsequently here: https://t.co/elMXA3rpbb.
Rivers said in the interview that she bought the handgun in Jacksonville for protection after a gruesome attempted sexual assault during which she was stabbed more than 20 times, an experience she recounted to investigators.
Rivers said in the interview that she hadn‚Äôt seen the gun in the last ‚Äúfour or five years‚Äù and thought her ex-boyfriend may have taken it when he left.
She said in the interview that the strap on her briefcase broke so she put things in a new bag, not realizing that the pistol was in there too. D.C. Superior Court records state several personal items were found in the same compartment as the weapon.
In the telephone interview, however, she said she did not have a specific meeting and intended instead to go door-to-door showing senators her healthcare product.
Rivers told investigators she wanted to show Booker healthcare technology. In the telephone interview she clarified the technology is a vitamin sensor that she says shows what vitamins a body needs. More info here: https://t.co/b17VsCAyXl
Rivers, who is originally from the D.C. area, told investigators she drove up from Florida in her Ford Explorer earlier in December. She had a meeting scheduled with Sen. Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, on Dec. 20 at 11 a.m.
‚ÄúIt was a complete accident,‚Äù Rivers said when reached by phone. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even know it was in the bag and had no idea.‚Äù
Rivers was stopped by Capitol Police when a security check revealed the pistol and ammunition in her bag. In an interview, Rivers called the incident an unfortunate mistake and said she had no plans to harm anyone.
Danielle Rivers, 47, of Jacksonville, Fla., was arrested on Dec. 20 for allegedly bringing an unlicensed firearm and a magazine containing unlicensed ammunition into Dirksen Senate Office Building. She could face up to 7 years in prison and a $7,000 fine for all the charges.
THREAD: This afternoon I spoke by phone with a woman arrested for alleged possession of an unlicensed handgun on her way to meet Sen. Cory Booker in his D.C. office. *Warning, this thread contains references to sexual assault/violence that could be triggering to survivors*
Capitol Police reports they arrested a suspect trying to bring an unregistered firearm and ammo into Dirksen Senate Office Building on 12/20

But Dems have shown they are in no mood to help GOP pass year end legislation as they have in the past. They‚Äôre really pissed about the tax bill
Conservatives have been seeking assurances of an open debate on FISA next year in exchange for voting for a short term extension. Not sure that is on the table anymore. Leaders may have to try to pass it as a standalone, which would likely require Dem votes.
FISA 702 reauthorization in the CR is a problem. Rep Scott Perry said there are enough members to tank CR is it includes FISA. Meadows has said for a while adding it into CR would be an issue
The house CR will include two defense related changes: $4 bil for missile defense to counter N Korean threat &amp; $700 mil to repair damaged Navy ships
Decision among House Republicans is that they‚Äôll try to pass short term extensions of all the legislation that needs to get passed by the end of the year. Dems have said no, so unclear they can pass it on their own

@jamiedupree As I wrote, ‚Äúmaybe an ill senator can‚Äôt make the vote‚Äù
@NickPisanoDC Sure, but they‚Äôve done nothing to address his deficit concerns
Like I said, it‚Äôs a long shot &amp; requires a LOT to go wrong. More than likely, the senate can pass tax next week, the House backs down &amp; passes a short term CR and everyone has a Merry Christmas. But thanks for indulging my fan fiction anyway
So, step 3-congress can‚Äôt agree on spending/tax, must come back Christmas week thereby allowing Jones to be seated. Once he‚Äôs in, Senate Rs can only lose 1 vote (corker is already a no). Collins or Rubio hold out. Tax reform fails
As of rn, Congress is supposed to recess after next week. Ala sec of st said Jones could be certified on Dec 28 but bc Congress is out he wouldn‚Äôt be seated until Jan 3. If Congress is in still fighting over approps or tax, Jones could be sworn in this year
Step 2-House &amp; Senate can‚Äôt agree on spending bill. House already laid the groundwork for this. They‚Äôre gonna pass a full year defense bill next week w CR for domestic spending. Senate won‚Äôt pass that. House digs in. Gov shuts down
So, step 1 - the agreement on tax reform falls apart in the Senate. Maybe Rubio holds it up, or maybe an ill senator can‚Äôt make the vote or Collins had a change of heart. For whatever reason, the tax vote drags beyond next week
Ok hear me out, but there is an emerging scenario in which republicans shut down the gov, allow Doug Jones to be seated and blow it on tax reform all before the end of the year. It is a long shot but man, I‚Äôve been covering these guys for years and there is always a chance

So they can push back in trump and prove to naysayers that their opposition is rooted in principle, not party (6)
This member instead wanted trump to win so conservatives can prove they're not just rapid partisans (5)
His tax plan would drive up the deficit, banning muslims is unconstitutional etc etc (4)
He knew, as many other house members do, that trump's policies aren't exactly textbook conservatism (3)
This member was hoping trump would win, but not for the reasons you might think (2)
