The British company pensions schemes are so clever and varied that so called government watchdogs are toothless because civil service types used.	Clever out of the box minds required here to strip the nano print exp the last few pages.
Lots of Pension Schemes have only just been set up, they are in many cases offshoots of previous or extant pension companies, cosy arrangements by large entities and pension boys, nice little club meetings these second pensions need close scrutiny, now.
Pensions are being via company schemes attached to employees that do not have a second pension.	These pensions should be transferable to the next employer that the recipient may go to.	Many however do not state that clearly on the initial pension letter to the employee.
Welsh Farmers receive £230, 000, 000 in subsidies from the EU.	92% of Welsh Sheep products are exported to the EU.	8% to England.	NZ and English Lamb is therefore 92% of shop bought lamb in England	Yet the Welsh I am told voted out!?	There is a welcome in the hillside..baa, baa.

The Credit Card Industry of UK which is mostly Visa and direct named Banks is an entity which the Italian mafia would be proud of, usury rates of interest, tame solicitors whose only income is debt collecting, so called dept collectors, but often heavy handed thugs, all 'legal'.
Britain has a low wage economy which leads to low level income people borrowing at usury interest rates from credit cards mostly in UK attached to banks, or building society's behaving as banks, then governments say borrowing too high, a dishonest spiral of financial conspiracy.

Britain's P.M. has obtained such a mad bad deal for her country that I wonder why the MP's are not saying, ' In the name of God go!'.	She is obviously like the previous Woman PM of the UK, in love with power, and sobbing as she leaves No.10 awaits her too.

@Bolddigger52 @perthwolves1 Answer is I am afraid simple British people are exhausted by all aspects of Brexit, it seems to be a political people's project along with the media world, but most people just wish to get on with the day to day stuff.	Also all parties including your own keep changing leaders.
Oil comes from the devil's arsehole, the devil knew that it would make humans kill each other by the millions in futile wars, those that offer alternative power sources are ridiculed and bribery and corruption keep dirty fuels first.
Russia, China, US, well if it's surveillance you're thinking of in numbers then it's the UK it's 65million people are watched by at least 40million camera's all the time, and that's just outside, but most British like it that way.

It seems that if one says something often enough to enough people one can convince oneself that it is the right thing at the right time, no matter that it is obvious that the agreement has no clothing on, a naked confidence trick on a nation by its leader.

Top people in the capitalist system are always using view friendly publications to print positive pictures of capitalism, but these pictures are always flawed and never hold up to academic scrutiny.	Admiring a well designed handbag does not mean agreeing with the 2,000 dollar tag
Capitalism is inhuman,anti-democratic, unsustainable,deeply exploitative system that must be dismantled.	It is to blame for global poverty, no economic system that leaves half the world struggling can be morally justifiable.

When a company is to be listed on the stock exchange at any level the financial health of a company about to accept public monies must be known, if not then the London Stock Exchange requires investigation itself, no entity is above investigation.
Financial Director's know EVERYTHING about a companies financial health, their task is to keep the board informed.	The auditors give a clean bill of financial health within the rules of accountancy agreed with government's.

First we are informed that Islam has clothing accepted in public when worn by a Woman, now we are informed by educated Females that there is NO mention at all of Female clothing/dress/covering in the Islam HOLY book.	It is MEN again, oppression again.
Clever move to make it a Woman's right to wear what ever clothing she wishes and not what was intended a criticism of Islamic clothing.	 " How to read a person like a book" a big seller in the 1970's ie looking at the face.	Many white so called Islamic converts wear ' letter box'

We have near my house a Tesco village shop, the local school children walk from school and are let in two at a time, I looked and saw that one out of two bought crisps, the lunch pack had none so the kids got their own, slam dunk.
ITV should be prevented from showing healthy food programs that have crisps in the advertising breaks prior to the start, during the program and at the end of the program as it is the worse type of hypocrisy and almost evil in it's intent.
Crisps should not be directly advertised to children on young person's TV programs.	They are probably crunching them whilst watching anyway as lazy often overweight parent's/carers use crisps as fast solution to kids food whine, easy to provide,and cheaply  made one's the worse.
Crisps are so profitable that they are often even in such up market food outlets as Waitrose let alone the Tesco's, Sainsbury's, and Lidls an entire row to themselves, also many outlets two minutes from shops for lunches, even if not put in lunchbox by parent's	They are fattening
Crisps should be treated as sweets, they are often cooked in drenching cooking oils which are not given type on packets, they are eaten in vast quantities by obese school aged students, and mass coverage advertising by an ex footballer which is a fitness sport so a contradiction.
I wish Richard Branson far more luck as an astronaut than he has had in the various air type travel exploits that he has taken part in so far.
Make the footballer with the gun tattoo give everyone the explanation not just the F.A.

It is NOT nazi to not wish your country to be forced to accept those who do not respect you or your country or your inherent culture, it is population engineering for economic reasons, but most immigrants shall require help, they shall pay no tax, and work within own cliques.

The EU as a communistic entity is every bit as bad as Islamisation as they are both entities of no choice, punishments if rules infringed and hidden people at the top, they are both population engineering monolithic structures of control and power neither really care about YOU.

Sweden however is a far smaller population and has had nothing at all to do with wars in Arab countries, yet has a disproportionate number of single economic Muslim migrants entering, this can only be local authorities and Swedes must deal with these local representives harshly.

I read that which he said, and as I also think the concept of a royal family anywhere on earth not elected to the real hidden power and worship of those who already have power over the British people is not to be admired I agree.	But he grew up in Britain and must respect culture https://t.co/oamTMuCESG
If a person of Islam asked me what have I against Islam in Britain I would say only that as Islam does not allow any other belief's and I am Roman Catholic until my death, how can I ?.	And Sharia Law is not the law of Britain or of the British.	English Law is that which I obey.
@peakdistrict @derbypromo This reads like some kind of Communist notice not a National Park so called authority, why do public workers crave power over the populace always in the spurious name of health and safety and keep our parks for enjoyment of all Kant.
Wonderful so very lovely, keep them safe from Islamist scum. https://t.co/4BPxZkTAO7
What did you do in the great Brexit war Daddy?  many shall say one distant day. https://t.co/OvX3oONqCQ
Great stuff Nigel, I was in that same pub in April, and almost stripped to my naughtiness in Supreme Court tour by Black security guys what did they think I was carrying, it was not worth it. https://t.co/LVanmcfWxD
Beyond words. https://t.co/vG8W8Ugiwo
@MrHickmott @FT Train your own population, if there were less class system and brain prejudice in UK there would be a far less shortage of manpower. Farmer's on CAP tax advantages and grants still wish to exploit incomers to financial advantages.	British plumber's are plumber's, but pay tax.
I really do think that would be a human rights issue of the first order. https://t.co/HIjmuNxT8g
What is funny is that the two each side of Mrs May know that she is lying to the British people everyday. https://t.co/yjDSNPdVpg
Picture of typical Scandinavian idiot, when it's far too late sandle brained such as this shall rue the day they came up with trash, but by then far too late. https://t.co/p36DnTo1JU
You look GREAT fuck the troll, troll's are lonely people playing with themselves in a darkened room, feel sorry for them, but worry not about them. https://t.co/GxDcQfrGXr
Belgium is a lost cause, it is the first to go down not fighting.	I find Belgium's beer industry is one of oldest in Europe, how is this Muslim scourge being allowed to do this to a sovereign country?	WAKE UP WESTERN EUROPE !	I shall FIGHT for my religion, as my forefathers did. https://t.co/6ueuEmlJTH
Business inward migration as one thing only, cheap exploitable labour, they would import Martian's if they would work cheaply, and be compliant to bad practice and little health and safety.	Business leaders never live near migrants, they live in hideaway mansion's in countryside. https://t.co/pyuVAczlyR
