The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will invigorate our economy and I look forward to finally getting this to President Trump's desk to be signed into law. A fair and simple tax code would be a long overdue Christmas gift for the American people.
This is real money that families can use for mortgages, school, or other needs. This legislation not only lowers rates for American families, but also for small businesses who will create jobs and invest in our communities.
We are now one step closer to tax relief for the American people. It has been estimated that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will raise after-tax income for middle income families in Georgia by $2,355.
