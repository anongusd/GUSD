@thehill Lol, omg, I missed this.		Maybe he meant, like, a restaurant reservation? Oh dear...
"He said, 'I have nominated you ‚Ä¶ respectfully on behalf of Japan. I am asking them to give you the Nobel Peace Prize,' " Trump continued, before adding that he would "probably never get it" even though "many other people feel that way too." https://t.co/PeEfAzq1BR
This is "Exhibit B" with "A" being his "I didn't have to do this" clip.		#TrumpFakeEmergency		Family separation is the real border crisis. https://t.co/0b4aTGmCcA
Exhibit B
There isn't a full-length border wall and they are still in Tijuana...		This is a contradiction to what Trump says.		Therefore, we don't need a full-length border barrier, fence, or wall.		A bill was signed for border security.		We don't need a "#TrumpFakeEmergency" https://t.co/0b4aTGmCcA
29:19 "In Tijuana, you have a lot of people staying there. If we didn't have the wall up and if we didn't have the wall secured and strengthened," he shrugs, "they woulda walked right through, they'd be welcomed to the United States."		@realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer
@realDonaldTrump (at 29:06) uses the word "monstrous" to describe a caravan.		What happened to "tremendous"? You like "tremendous" things...		Again, this is the link I'm using: https://t.co/6qDFED50GS
By 28:27, Trump mentioned barbed wire twice. Didn't I see something about that?		https://t.co/m0UHg9hnjg
28:03 "...And they find an area where there's no barrier and they come into the United States. 'Welcome.'"
"Nancy [@SpeakerPelosi] knows it. Chuck [@SenSchumer] knows it. ... It's all a big lie. It's a big con game. You don't have to be [pause] very smart to know [pause] you put up a barrier, the people come in and... That's it. They can't do anything unless they walk left or right."
(I'm at 27:30 now)		@realDonaldTrump continues, "They open the door [of the car]. They look! They can't see three women with tape in their mouth[s] or three women whose hands are tied... They go through areas where you have no wall. Everybody knows that."
"That's what it is."	...	"And a big majority of the big drugs, the big drug loads, go through ports of entry... They can't go through ports of entry."	He repeats that you "can't" traffic humans through ports of entry.	...
"The only weakness is they go to a wall and then they go around the wall," @realDonaldTrump says, demonstrating with broad gestures.
At 26:44 we get to Israel: @realDonaldTrump uses this as an example of a wall that works, saying,		"Their wall is ninety-nine point nine percent effective, they told me. Ninety-nine point nine percent. That's what it would be with us too," as he touches his trench coat's lapel.
At 26 mins in he says the people at his rally in El Paso agreed with him that having the wall go up made things "100% better"		#ElPasoRally

@realDonaldTrump No one really clarified what time period "again" refers to. Like what specific aspects of American history do you want to recreate? This was never addressed.
@realDonaldTrump any updates on the details of the national emergency? Who would be affected by this proposed reallocation of funds?

@realDonaldTrump You've done a lot of questionable things, but right now I'm apologizing for something I'm seeing: body-shaming.		Who cares how much he weighs? Is that your biggest issue?		People should accept their bodies and love themselves. Can't we promote that instead?

@Acosta Oh so now we're body shaming now?		As a liberal/progressive, Dems are losing the game of being the party of higher standards with ANY slip up because I expect way better.		Where's change through compassion? The hypocrisy in the world right now is absolutely staggering.
@krassenstein @VicImes A better one... if Dems could get behind immigration numbers... No one wants to let immigrants in :(
@krassenstein @VicImes The emergency is people coming here for help and I think we should help them. So there is kind of an emergency.		That's how Trump has his support. There is technically something happening at the border and a wall is his "solution." We need a solution.
@RepValDemings What... it's not? We should help them though...
@EdKrassen Deep down Trump is a liberal, so he is okay with this. Remember, he came from entertainment... he is so stranger to these ideals.		In fact he used to be a Clinton donor.
@PalmerReport I mean, hopefully...		But this got me wondering how Obama got his executive orders through when the Republicans were in control. I was in college at the time and didn't follow the process, only the results.
@EdKrassen The emergency on the border is migrants who need help
@RepEliotEngel Maybe he has something to relate to with Obama now! Point that out to him and see how he reacts. You have to actually reach out and talk to him to elicit change...		I'm the same way. I get more resistant if I feel attacked, even if I know I could be wrong. It's pretty normal.
@NoahCRothman @SykesCharlie Saying as a liberal: Dems are losing this with their own hyperbole and hate.		@realDonaldTrump is right about a few things: that Dems can be hateful. Step away from hyperbole, reach out with compassion to conservatives, and we might get through this.		Cue hate toward me:
@RepJeffries The crisis is migrants who need help. So... simply claiming there is NO emergency isn't accurate.
@RepJayapal The crisis is migrants who need help. Sounds like Dems and GOP can't agree on immigration but agree there can be a barrier. Welcome to the US.		By using the line "there is no crisis" you're playing the same game as  the GOP and that weakens the Dems' position.
