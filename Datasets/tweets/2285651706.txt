RT @1980reagan: The leading Democratic candidates for IL Governor all want to raise your taxes again.  We need to CUT taxes, not raise them!
@capitolfax @WCIA3Mark Yes.
@WCIA3Mark I do not like the Ives negative ad.  Serious issues shouldn't be satirized. I like the other Ives positive ad that focuses on her military service and family.  Nothing changes the fact that Bruce Rauner is a failed Governor who brags that he's not in charge.
