@MarkDice I’m curious as to which country he thinks is the greatest?
@brianstartare @NHL @Simmonds17 Well played sir. Well played. 👍🏻
@ChrisHayesTV Outrageous
@CrossingBroad Pass. Move on. It’s gone on long enough.
@treed1919 @TSNBobMcKenzie 😂😂👍🏻
@D_LEED Let’s hope
@SB52forever @CrossingBroad There is nothing but maybe the weather that LA has over Philly, period and certainly not anything sports related.
@DStrehleTFP Glad for him. Class act
@valkyrie_hanna @no_silenced @politico I thought you were anti-stupid. There were fewer taxes taken out of your paycheck therefore you took home more $ during the year. Surprise! You get a smaller refund. 😂😂😂
@RealSaavedra I’m sure she is a nice person but she is really a moron.
@dbongino Dan they are allergic to the truth.
@Troylutman1 @tpanotchRET And not relevant either. 😂😂
@w_terrence Wishing you a full and speedy recovery.
@RandPaul Guy should be prosecuted
@THNKenCampbell Relax Mr Campbell. Have you actually seen him play a game over the last season and a half? He has learned a great deal. The guy has 49 PIM for the season.
@BigDaddyGraham Nope
RT @RNCastaldo: Let’s roll the tapes again. It would be something if you retweeted this viral video of Obama sounding like @realDonaldTrump…
@JaniceDean You are a good egg JD.
@SpeakerPelosi @JussieSmollett This didn’t age well now did it ?
@CarBombBoom13 Every one of these stories should be a reminder to all leagues, teams, parents, coaches and players what a serious issue this is. We must all put the health and well being of our players ahead of anything else. Be vigilant and protect the players.
@twolinepass It’s a good trade for both. The Flyers have their franchise goalie, they get a healthy backup and Stolarz, who will be an unrestricted free agent, gets a chance to compete in Edmonton. I think Philly did fine here.
@DebBryan10 @Ilhan @DebBryan10 I couldn’t agree more. 👍🏻🇺🇸
@TechieLiao @conncarroll Your high man.
@Jeremy_Roenick @Macys Nice job JR
@WaveItByeBye Thanks for all the Orioles Memories Joe. You will be missed. Enjoy your retirement. You’ve certainly earned it
@chrislhayes 😂😂😂😂😂😂
@DanRather And I’m old enough to remember a lot of the crap you peddled as news when you actually were injecting your opinion/ preferences. “You can take that to the bank.”
@DMVHockey Hey you do a great job Scott. Keep it up.
@DailyCaller @IlhanMN The left and the Democrat party have become a freak show. Doesn’t matter how you identify, biology is biology. Sounds like she is a science denier.
@LarrySabato So they will put politics and party ahead of what is the right thing to do? Both sides are full of people who don’t have the best interest of the town, city, county, state, country first. Double standards abound.
@cvpayne Sorry to hear the news. Liked Bob and his segments. Always relevant and interesting.
@CarBombBoom13 @DavidGa00551603 @GoldenKnights @NHL That’s disgraceful
@JoRedbone @RichLowry @brithume You certainly are entitled to your opinion.  We should be able to agree and disagree respectfully.

@DavidAFrench Couldn’t agree more. Played all the way through college + 1  year. Prepared me for life.

@DanRather Once again Dan, you are on the wrong side of the story. Unfortunately this has been all too commonplace with your partisan behavior. Your name and reputation has been tainted long ago and the disturbing behavior continues.  You can take it to the bank. https://t.co/NyvfzgaS3h

@chucktodd This may be the most laughable tweet you’ve made Chuck. I would say many (but certainly not all) in the media have done a great disservice to the trade by their blind hate of politicians with whom they happen to disagree or not like personally.
@LarrySabato @BWray_ I guess Mr Mueller set things straight through his spokesperson.

@coleen1027 @DonaldJTrumpJr @SebGorka Really 😂😂😂
@DonaldJTrumpJr @SebGorka That clown is just a bitter never Trumper. He lost his relevance in 2016 when the people voted and sent the message that they’ve had enough of the establishment  and the status quo. SMH
@DRUDGE_REPORT That is the most ridiculous. More  Twitter humor
@HillaryClinton Besides what have you done to move the country forward towards a more civil discourse? Let me answe that for you. Zero, nada. Nothing. If you fancy your self as@some kind of leader at least act like one and not like a bitter, sore loser.
@HillaryClinton Move on. You lost 2X once to @BarackObama and then to @realDonaldTrump.
@MalcolmJenkins You did. Keep it up. Bounce back next year. Thanks for the leadership.
@bbrooks_79 Get well and get back at it. Fly🦅🦅🦅🦅Fly. So proud of the effort and heart you guys showed. Brought pride back to the city and to those of us who live elsewhere but bleed green.
@WalshFreedom You all are dillusional. It’s hysterical reading the posts here. Who said Twitter couldn’t provide some levity? If you honestly believe what you are typing- you need help.
@RichLowry @Ron_Christie To see some of the responses here is just laughable. Their blind hate prevents them from being able to comprehend reasonable thought and any possible progress. SMH

@KellybeansTweet @cmconcepts @Ocasio2018 @realDonaldTrump That’s the 1st honest thing you have tweeted in this thread. Progress has been made.
@KellybeansTweet @cmconcepts @Ocasio2018 @realDonaldTrump Beansy again with the blanket assumptions, attacks and generalizations. What a peach! Still in your head
@KellybeansTweet @cmconcepts @Ocasio2018 @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/ROnsyrsEck
@KellybeansTweet @cmconcepts @Ocasio2018 @realDonaldTrump Debate? That’s as laughable as it gets. You can’t even admit a mistake.  You are the only one in this conversation who has  not only misinterpreted and misrepresented facts but have resorted to insults as well,I guess you call that a win. If that makes you feel better, Ok then.
@KellybeansTweet @cmconcepts @Ocasio2018 @realDonaldTrump Laughing at your  pettiness and foolishness. Must really have gotten under your skin for you to feel so compelled to keep this childishness up eh? You just can’t walk away. It’s okay Kelly I’m here for you to continue your  impetuous behavior if it helps make you feel better.
@KellybeansTweet @cmconcepts @Ocasio2018 @realDonaldTrump Again you might want to think about what you tweeted, hard as it maybe. Who said I am a doctor? MD is a state’s abbreviation. Once again your hate has made you look foolish. Maybe you should relax and read more closely. Another sign of your being so overcome with anger and hate.
@KellybeansTweet @cmconcepts @Ocasio2018 @realDonaldTrump What’s more telling Kelly is your apparent disdain for those who have chosen professions that serve the sick     Your condescending comment with respect to the duties of an orderly speak volumes to your character. You will probably delete it as you will run and hide
@KellybeansTweet @cmconcepts @Ocasio2018 @realDonaldTrump One more thing Kelly. I see from your resume you couldn’t make it in the private sector. Had to become part of the big government eh? You know what they say,”Those who can, do. Those who can’t, teach? Those who can’t teach...
@KellybeansTweet @cmconcepts @Ocasio2018 @realDonaldTrump That’s mature. Your good. You nailed it. I’m busted and so are you. Your response proves again that you have no real response so you resort to insults. Unhinged you are.
@KellybeansTweet @cmconcepts @Ocasio2018 @realDonaldTrump Were you looking in the mirror when you  wrote this? You haven’t gotten over 2016. Admit it. You still cry yourself to sleep at night and still believe wild conspiracy stories to help you justify the small delusional space in the world you occupy.
@ShannonBream I know you know the answer Shannon. Self loathing liberals who have no answer for reasonable, well thought out and logical arguments presented to them resort to attempts to insult others. In this case she not only lost the debate, she also failed miserably. Keep up the great work
@Comey With all due respect and I sincerely mean it , am I mistaken that in a closed door meeting/ hearing , you would be freer to speak openly as compared to a public hearing where classified matters could not be discussed? I would think that’s what you would want, isn’t it?
@KellybeansTweet @cmconcepts @Ocasio2018 @realDonaldTrump You know what the beauty of our exchange is? I’ll tell you. You have become unhinged and have become hostile.  You’ve hurled insults. No room for debate or civil discourse with those who disagree with your bias views. It’s not about facts. It’s all about you. #zeroterancebylibs
@KellybeansTweet @cmconcepts @Ocasio2018 @realDonaldTrump That’s your opinion. Opinions are like........  well you know the rest. It’s clear, you just have to pontificate to let everyone know how smart you are and help you feel relevant.  Like I said enjoy your turkey.
@KellybeansTweet @cmconcepts @Ocasio2018 @realDonaldTrump You of all people ( according to your own self promotion ) should know better than to omit facts and the various reasons for bankruptcies etc.  just blinded by misguided hate and a closed mind. Enjoy your turkey
@KellybeansTweet @cmconcepts @Ocasio2018 @realDonaldTrump Lawyers are employed by businesses all the time. President Trump , as a business man employed lawyers to handle legal work  to facilitate business decisions.
@KellybeansTweet @cmconcepts @Ocasio2018 @realDonaldTrump So a law degree qualifies you as a business expert. Nice! I guess you are also an expert on medical matters. Well with my business background I am qualified to diagnose you with TDS. My prescription for you -relax and find a meaningful hobby to help you deal with your issues

@johnnydollar01 @Sulliview Additionally, and let me make this very clear. Every victim should have a voice and should be heard. At the same time every accused person has the right to defend themselves and should be given the opportunity.
@johnnydollar01 @Sulliview I guess @Sulliview and the rest of the MSM feel Judge Kavanaugh doesn’t have the right to have a voice amen speak up and defend the accusations. Only the accusers have a voice and additionally, the MSM has a voice too.
@ChuckRossDC That hilarious.
@sweetgreatmom @SenateMajLdr Classy. Again when you have nothing of value to say you resort to the lowest common denominator.
@SharylAttkisson As he should be.
@frankrichny You too are a scumbag.
@MichaelAvenatti You are a scumbag.
@FrenchwFrench @JackPosobiec They have jobs to go to and need to work.
@DanRather It’s time to retire Dan. You can take that to the bank.
@ZZ_NYC @Michael68893118 @CatrineMarie @ccowley57 @BretBaier He’s your president too. Also,thanks for the lecture. Not really sure what your point is. You’ve gotten way off track here. I hope you can find peace and enjoy your weekend.
@brithume Great piece
@ChampionCapua @JohnJHarwood Who’s the hack? 😂😂😂
@ShannonBream That is a ridiculous request. Judge Kavanaugh has the right to hear the accusations and be able to respond.
@Kynigos_ Yes absolutely. My point was there is evidence of his misbehavior, on the other hand there is none with respect to Judge Kavanaugh and many here are presuming guilt.
@AnnKeenan3434 @KenMatthews @RepCummings Name calling always works. Keep it classy. I guess when facts aren’t on your side and you have nothing to contribute, you seek the low ground. Reduces your position to rubble.
@RepCummings You have made a career of being a politician off the backs of many hard working people here in Maryland. Term limits sound like a great idea for you and the rest of your colleagues in the house and senate non both sides. Presidents and governors have term limits. So should you
@RepCummings Only your interests and your colleagues in the house.
@RepCummings You have done nothing for me here in Maryland. You do not represent my best interests. Only y
@RepCummings At least be consistent across the board. She has an opportunity to testify. I’m encouraged that it appears she will. Let’s get it done. You and your colleagues on both sides should do more for the people of this country. Instead you all play partisan politics. It sucks.
@RepCummings What are you doing about Keith Ellison? There are 911 records and medical records available to investigate. Oh, that’s right, facts don’t matter only claims that emerge after 36 years out of the blue. You know this is about control of the Supreme Court and nothing more.
@ZZ_NYC @Michael68893118 @CatrineMarie @ccowley57 @BretBaier I’ll leave that to you.

@Lawrence But these same people actually know it’s not a case to be investigated by the FBI. It’s a stall tactic and you know it.
@sallybmccarty @LdyDirectr @Kamgirl47 @SenatorCollins @FBI You are delusional
@KFILE Agreed. Maybe @RepMaxineWaters could take some advice and turn down the rhetoric as well

@RyanPimentel @JoeNBC You obviously don’t watch @FoxNews if you think he was a “token” liberal on the network. You just belittled him and the dignified work he did both on TV and Radio.

@johnrobertsFox @MedStarWHC Get well John. Wishing you a speedy recovery
@MeghanMcCain I am stunned by the behavior of many. Hang in there. I’m sure your parents are proud of the job they’ve done and the children they have raised. 👍🏻😊
@Lovemydogsxo @Janet4OH Senseless tweet. Why contribute to the nonsense?
@BretBaier @jaketapper I think it would be most productive if everyone on both sides of the spectrum would just admit there has been poor behavior on both side and move forward with an attempt towards more civility without the yes but crap
@brithume Brit I am sorry you have to experience such awful comments from lowlifes like that guy. You are a man with impeccable credentials, character and class. I know many others feel the way I do and have nothing but respect and admiration for you.
@ABC I guess she isn’t counting Benghazi. Hmmm
@RepSwalwell @HouseFloor @HouseGOP @RepMikeQuigley @WhipHoyer @HouseDemocrats You all need to spend more time working than spewing ridiculous conspiracy theories about members of Congress on both sides.

@TerryMoran Gee Terry, I wonder why? How classy of you to try to discredit @ShannonBream. I guess it only matters when reporters and women who work at your or other outlets with your agenda matter. Shannon is an outstanding journalist and deserves your respect.

@TerryMcAuliffe That’s hilarious. You actually don’t believe that right? Just like the lefties President Obama nominated and were confirmed to the SCOTUS haven’t ruined the USA. There are elections and they have consequences. Dems need to act like adults with reasonable and credible candidates

@MajoratNJ gotta cut the spending. Can't keep doing the same thing and digging a deeper hole.
@MRichie18 As far as I'm concerned, your time with Philly is exemplified by your goal and effort vs Montreal in 09-10 ECF-GM5 #leadbyexample
@TheHockeyGuys
@D_LEED do you see them moving Bob or anyone else to make room? Is Drury an option?

@incarceratedbob thanks
@incarceratedbob Do you think the Philliies will bid for Beltran?
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
@dchesnokov did not realize it. Wow! Well I hope he still gets a chance if not in Philly somewhere. Tampa and NJ both good options I think
@dchesnokov agreed. His #'s this year were very good + he got 60 games under his belt. Only will get better. Great attitude and work ethic.
@dchesnokov me too. Big fan. Saw him play all season on Center Ice and in Philly.  Bryz is great but I wish it was shorter. Bob is future
@dchesnokov fresh start for him. He deserves it.
@dchesnokov hey hockey question. How do you think Varley will do in CO and will the Flyers keep Bob? If not,where do you see him going?
@dchesnokov funny, my two Goldens love the vet. Go figure! :)
@dchesnokov how is your dog doing tonight?
@tpanotchCSN did you watch last night's game?
@BroadStBull Enjoy your time off.
@BroadStBull Sam It seems like Langenbrunner had no interest in being a Flyer. Your thoughts?
@Eklund Ek any significance to the "LA" and "RU" in your tweet? :-)
@Bret_Baier What was wrong with the panel?
@bryzgoalie30 how about pictures of Bernie Parent and Pelle Lindbergh and Ron Hextall?
@simmonssteve Nice job Steve. Thanks for recognizing Fred Shero.
Happy 4th of July. Great day in our country's history.
@Eklund Who would that be?
@BroadStBull Are the Kings changing their colors to Orange and Black this season? ;-)
@BroadStBull I guess we'll have to see how Bryz does this season to make that determination. Sam, do you think the Flyers make anymore moves
@Bret_Baier maryland
@MRichie18 mike we will miss you in Philly. #10 is good
@MRichie18 Mike best of luck to you. You deserve the best. Philly will miss you
@bryzgoalie30 Hey Bryz please sign with the Flyers. You'll love the fans and the city. Just ask Cliff Lee
@bryzgoalie30 please sign with the Flyers. You'll love the fans and the city
@BroadStBull Why only 40% chance they sign him
